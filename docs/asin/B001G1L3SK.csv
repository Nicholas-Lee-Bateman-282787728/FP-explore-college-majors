1193199,A2WHQZXGP0DOYS,B001G1L3SK,Buddy S,"[0, 0]","Few female singers have a voice that sounds as pure and as sweet as Alison Krauss' and this DVD serves as a perfect showcase for her music.  This disk is a recording of a TV program based on Alison's related CD ""A Hundred Miles or More: A Collection.""  The DVD, however, has only 8 of the 16 songs from the CD, but contains one additional song: ""Shadows"" during which Alison is accompanied by guitarist Tony Rice.Included in the DVD set list are three duets: (1) with James Taylor (""How's the World Treating You""), (2) with Brad Paisley (""Whiskey Lullaby"") and (3) with John Waite (""Lay Down Beside Me."")  Alison sings one additional song accompanied by Rice on the guitar (""Sawing on the Strings."")  Alison's band Union Station also performs during each song.  There are interviews with the performers between songs.The DVD running time is slightly under an hour.  Surprisingly, audio is offered only in two channel stereo - there is no Dolby 5.1 surround option.  Notwithstanding this, both the vocals and instruments sound terrific.  Also, the mixing is excellent.  The ""Tracking Room"" setup seems ideal for these performers and the song selections.  The video is also excellent, with an emphasis on warm colors, which adds to the intimacy of the music.  The DVD menu offers only three options: to play the entire program, or the songs only or the interviews only.  There are no ""extras"" offered on the disk.I enjoy watching this DVD immensely, but I offer just one word of caution.  While the music is great, the pace is slow (with the exception of the two Tony Rice songs) and the tone of much of the program is on the somber side.  In other words, there is little on this disk that is going to make someone jump up from the couch and start dancing around the room.  This, however, does not in any way detract from the artistic quality of the performance.  In summary, if you are looking for a laid back and enjoyable evening listening to and watching one of the finest female vocalists around, I highly recommend this disk.",5,Alison Krauss Sings Like an Angel,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2029,"['Few', 'female', 'singers', 'have', 'voice', 'pure', 'as', 'sweet', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'DVD', 'perfect', 'showcase', 'music', 'disk', 'recording', 'TV', 'program', 'based', 'Alison', 'related', 'CD', 'Hundred', 'Miles', 'More', 'Collection', 'DVD', 'however', 'only', '8', '16', 'songs', 'CD', 'one', 'additional', 'song', 'Shadows', 'Alison', 'accompanied', 'guitarist', 'Tony', 'Rice.Included', 'DVD', 'set', 'list', 'are', 'three', 'duets', '1', 'James', 'Taylor', 'How', 'World', 'Treating', '2', 'Brad', 'Paisley', 'Whiskey', 'Lullaby', '3', 'John', 'Waite', 'Lay', 'Down', 'Beside', 'Me', 'Alison', 'one', 'additional', 'song', 'accompanied', 'Rice', 'guitar', 'Sawing', 'Strings', 'Alison', 'band', 'Union', 'Station', 'also', 'song', 'are', 'interviews', 'performers', 'songs.The', 'DVD', 'running', 'time', 'slightly', 'hour', 'Surprisingly', 'audio', 'offered', 'only', 'two', 'channel', 'stereo', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'surround', 'option', 'Notwithstanding', 'vocals', 'instruments', 'sound', 'terrific', 'Also', 'mixing', 'excellent', 'Tracking', 'Room', 'setup', 'ideal', 'performers', 'song', 'selections', 'video', 'also', 'excellent', 'emphasis', 'warm', 'colors', 'intimacy', 'music', 'DVD', 'menu', 'only', 'three', 'options', 'play', 'entire', 'program', 'songs', 'only', 'interviews', 'only', 'are', 'extras', 'offered', 'disk.I', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'DVD', 'immensely', 'offer', 'just', 'one', 'word', 'caution', 'music', 'great', 'pace', 'slow', 'exception', 'two', 'Tony', 'Rice', 'songs', 'tone', 'much', 'program', 'somber', 'side', 'other', 'words', 'little', 'disk', 'going', 'make', 'someone', 'jump', 'up', 'couch', 'start', 'dancing', 'room', 'however', 'not', 'way', 'detract', 'artistic', 'quality', 'performance', 'summary', 'are', 'looking', 'laid', 'back', 'enjoyable', 'evening', 'listening', 'watching', 'one', 'finest', 'female', 'vocalists', 'highly', 'recommend', 'disk']",N/A

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[0, 0]","When Alison Krauss first joined with Union Station (Ron Block, Dan Tyminski, Barry Bales and the always spectacular Jerry Douglas) she was playing fiddle on nearly all the numbers. Then she had her crossover hit ""Baby, Now That I Found You"" and the fiddle took a back seat. I still think she's a great instrumentalist, but, for eight of the nine sings here - the lone exception being ""Sawing On The Strings"" with Tony Rice - it's her beautiful vocals on display. She duets with James Taylor, Brad Paisley (oh to only see them work out on a hot instrumental one day!), and John Waite.This 57 minute program was originally produced for the Great American Country cable network and it's a nice feature that you can play just the music or just the interviews on subsequent viewings.The camera work is sharp and excellent - I do not have an HD set - so you can see Krauss's gorgeous facial features and porcelain-like skin.Warning to those who have an older style square TV screen. This was filmed so the aspect is for wide-screen TVs. There are no black bars and standard aspect TVs will have the sides cut off. This only affects when the musicians are named, but it might be a concern to some.Definitely a winner for Krauss fans and those who want to see some of the best players in modern bluegrass accompany a voice that has no equal.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,Does anyone else have a voice this heavenly and skin so pure??,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1366,"['When', 'Alison', 'Krauss', 'first', 'joined', 'Union', 'Station', 'Ron', 'Block', 'Dan', 'Tyminski', 'Barry', 'Bales', 'always', 'spectacular', 'Jerry', 'Douglas', 'was', 'playing', 'fiddle', 'nearly', 'numbers', 'Then', 'had', 'crossover', 'hit', 'Baby', 'Now', 'Found', 'fiddle', 'took', 'back', 'seat', 'still', 'think', 'great', 'instrumentalist', 'eight', 'nine', 'sings', 'here', 'lone', 'exception', 'being', 'Sawing', 'Strings', 'Tony', 'Rice', 'beautiful', 'vocals', 'display', 'James', 'Taylor', 'Brad', 'Paisley', 'oh', 'only', 'see', 'work', 'out', 'hot', 'instrumental', 'one', 'day', 'John', 'Waite.This', '57', 'minute', 'program', 'was', 'originally', 'produced', 'Great', 'American', 'Country', 'cable', 'network', 'nice', 'feature', 'can', 'play', 'just', 'music', 'just', 'interviews', 'subsequent', 'viewings.The', 'camera', 'work', 'sharp', 'excellent', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'HD', 'set', 'can', 'see', 'Krauss', 'gorgeous', 'facial', 'features', 'porcelain-like', 'skin.Warning', 'who', 'have', 'older', 'style', 'square', 'TV', 'screen', 'was', 'filmed', 'so', 'aspect', 'wide-screen', 'TVs', 'are', 'black', 'bars', 'standard', 'aspect', 'TVs', 'will', 'have', 'sides', 'cut', 'off', 'only', 'when', 'musicians', 'are', 'named', 'might', 'be', 'concern', 'some.Definitely', 'winner', 'Krauss', 'fans', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'best', 'players', 'modern', 'bluegrass', 'accompany', 'voice', 'equal.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

If ""Sawing on the strings"" doesn't get your feet tapping, have the man screw the lid down right away.My main problem is that there is rather short measure here, only 9 tracks (the identically-named CD has rather more, although the other tracks (e.g. with the Chieftains) were probably recorded at a different place and time). Secondly, not even the brilliance of Ms. Krauss and Union Station can compensate for the lack of brilliance of some of the partners. I found both the James Taylor and John Waite efforts particularly poor.I found the various interviews a bit painful, with everyone saying how wonderful everyone else was and how they sacrificed to each other's effigies every night.
