717165,A1MV8LXEXO8EWC,B00006IUHL,"Amazon Customer ""The Ideator""","[6, 6]","This series features the unwelcome German occupation of a Channel Island called Guernsey in World War II.  The series ran for only two seasons, so it highlights conditions before the worst conditions asserted themselves later during the occupation.The film has an intellectual,  managerial flair to it, and explores the politics, managerial decision-making, and injustices that happened during the occupation.  It shows both the brutality and racism of some members of the German occupation forces, as well as some very decent, principled German commanders who tried to be as fair as their mandate allowed.  It's quite talky in spots, but well-written with very realistic dialogue, exploring real issues you would expect to happen when a foreign power occupies another.The series is filmed in color, but it's a kind of ""washed out"" color.  The coloring preserves the black and white flavor of the era that we see in pictures, while providing enough color to give it a modern look and feel.There are no subtitles, unfortunately -- something us North American viewers appreciate when the British speak quickly and with an accent that makes certain words unintelligible.  But unlike many other British Television series, this was only a minor inconvenience.The actors all do a great job of their roles, the only criticism is the use of British actors for German soldiers -- at times I laughed when the German General on the island said ""Good Heavens!"" in upper-crust British accent -- sometimes it made it hard to determine who was German, and who was British.However, I was so engaged in this series, that I bought the second boxed set, and I've watched several of the episodes twice, the dialogue is so rich, and the way problems were resolved, so intelligent.",5,"Thought-Provoking, Apparently Fair Look at the German Occupation of a Channel Island",1224892800,"10 25, 2008",2008,1759,"['series', 'unwelcome', 'German', 'occupation', 'Channel', 'Island', 'called', 'Guernsey', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'series', 'ran', 'only', 'two', 'seasons', 'conditions', 'worst', 'conditions', 'asserted', 'later', 'occupation.The', 'film', 'intellectual', 'managerial', 'flair', 'politics', 'managerial', 'decision-making', 'injustices', 'happened', 'occupation', 'brutality', 'racism', 'members', 'German', 'occupation', 'forces', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'decent', 'principled', 'German', 'commanders', 'who', 'tried', 'be', 'as', 'fair', 'mandate', 'allowed', 'quite', 'talky', 'spots', 'well-written', 'very', 'realistic', 'dialogue', 'exploring', 'real', 'issues', 'would', 'expect', 'happen', 'when', 'foreign', 'power', 'occupies', 'another.The', 'series', 'filmed', 'color', 'kind', 'washed', 'out', 'color', 'coloring', 'black', 'white', 'flavor', 'era', 'see', 'pictures', 'providing', 'enough', 'color', 'give', 'modern', 'look', 'are', 'subtitles', 'unfortunately', 'something', 'North', 'American', 'viewers', 'appreciate', 'when', 'British', 'speak', 'quickly', 'accent', 'certain', 'words', 'unintelligible', 'many', 'other', 'British', 'Television', 'series', 'was', 'only', 'minor', 'inconvenience.The', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'roles', 'only', 'criticism', 'use', 'British', 'actors', 'German', 'soldiers', 'times', 'laughed', 'when', 'German', 'General', 'island', 'said', 'Good', 'Heavens', 'upper-crust', 'British', 'accent', 'made', 'hard', 'determine', 'who', 'was', 'German', 'who', 'was', 'British.However', 'was', 'so', 'engaged', 'series', 'bought', 'second', 'boxed', 'set', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'episodes', 'twice', 'dialogue', 'so', 'rich', 'way', 'problems', 'were', 'resolved', 'so', 'intelligent']",N/A

In that sense, the show is a whitewash.  I would be interested in knowing what was the reception in Great Britain when this series was released in 1978.  Of course, American's had Hogan's Heroes a few years earlier.That said, I admit to having enjoyed the series of two years.  I have no clue if the show was cancelled after the second year, but I could see that it may have run its course.  The actor who played the German commandant was exceptional.  I understand that he was a well known British t.v. actor.  I wouldn't mind seeing some of his other work.My favorite show of the first season was ""Jerrybag"" that was about the relationship between a native female, with a German soldier.  This resulted in a child, but the soldier leaving to the Russian front.  The story was troubling and captivating.  Interestingly, it was the only story line repeated in the second year of the show.  The ending of that second segment was rather upsetting.Not all of the stories were as interesting as others.  And not all of the recurring characters were as appealing.  The British doctor was too self righteous, and his wife was a bore.  The show was also clumsy in how it wrote out the doctor's daughter.  The best characters to like or hate were mostly the Germans.  I already mentioned the commandant, while the SS officer was particularly irritating in an entertaining way.The viewer should know that these discs do not have good photography.  The color is often washed out looking, and the actors sometimes rush their lines as in American soap operas.  I found the sound on the video set to be better than the dvd.  Also, the extra material on the dvd set was of little-to-no use.  Finally, the viewer will be likely pleased with the theme music.  I heard that the music was popular enough in Britain that a record of it was released in the late seventies.",4,A 70's British drama worth viewing.,1090800000,"07 26, 2004",2004,1952,"['reviewer', 'mentioned', 'too', 'was', 'bothered', 'showing', 'German', 'reasonable', 'occupiers', 'sense', 'show', 'whitewash', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'knowing', 'what', 'was', 'reception', 'Great', 'Britain', 'when', 'series', 'was', 'released', '1978', 'course', 'American', 'had', 'Hogan', 'Heroes', 'few', 'years', 'earlier.That', 'said', 'admit', 'having', 'enjoyed', 'series', 'two', 'years', 'have', 'clue', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'second', 'year', 'could', 'see', 'may', 'have', 'run', 'course', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'German', 'commandant', 'was', 'exceptional', 'understand', 'was', 'well', 'known', 'British', 't.v', 'actor', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'other', 'work.My', 'favorite', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'Jerrybag', 'was', 'relationship', 'native', 'female', 'German', 'soldier', 'resulted', 'child', 'soldier', 'leaving', 'Russian', 'front', 'story', 'was', 'troubling', 'captivating', 'Interestingly', 'was', 'only', 'story', 'line', 'repeated', 'second', 'year', 'show', 'ending', 'second', 'segment', 'was', 'rather', 'upsetting.Not', 'stories', 'were', 'as', 'interesting', 'others', 'not', 'recurring', 'characters', 'were', 'appealing', 'British', 'doctor', 'was', 'too', 'self', 'righteous', 'wife', 'was', 'bore', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'clumsy', 'how', 'wrote', 'out', 'doctor', 'daughter', 'best', 'characters', 'like', 'hate', 'were', 'mostly', 'Germans', 'already', 'mentioned', 'commandant', 'SS', 'officer', 'was', 'particularly', 'irritating', 'entertaining', 'way.The', 'viewer', 'should', 'know', 'discs', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'good', 'photography', 'color', 'often', 'washed', 'out', 'looking', 'actors', 'sometimes', 'rush', 'lines', 'American', 'soap', 'operas', 'found', 'sound', 'video', 'set', 'be', 'better', 'dvd', 'Also', 'extra', 'material', 'dvd', 'set', 'was', 'little-to-no', 'use', 'Finally', 'viewer', 'will', 'be', 'likely', 'pleased', 'theme', 'music', 'heard', 'music', 'was', 'popular', 'enough', 'Britain', 'record', 'was', 'released', 'late', 'seventies']",N/A

717173,A2K7ETEIA4AB5R,B00006IUHL,"PTR ""papapossum""","[42, 42]","My wife and I watched this after seeing ""Island at War"" -- an updating of the story of the German occupation of the Channel Islands on Masterpiece Theatre. Although the more recent telling was very similar in some of the plotlines, and had much superior production values, we found that this mid-70's production to be more enjoyable, and oddly enough, more realistic.This may be because Enemy at the Door is more episodic and deals with a wider range of people, everyone from the upper and upper middle classes, down to the very poor. At any rate, it does seem to give a very credible representation of what the occupation was like. Watching it demands something from the viewer; like much television from its era, it is not dumbed-down to a 12 year-old's level.Some caveats: Like an earlier reviewer, I wish the Germans, if they were going to speak without subtitles, had used at least mild German accents. Sometimes if a German was not in a Wehrmacht uniform, I wasn't sure if he was a German or not! This might have reinforced the ""othnerness"" of the invaders. Only the policeman Kluge seemed consistently half-way German-sounding.I also wish that some of the characters introduced in the episodes had reappeared later. Like characters in ""Gunsmoke"", folks show up for however many minutes, and then, even though they obviously haven't left the island, are never seen again.Finally, both my wife and I kept desparately hoping that the Martell's insufferable daughter would be killed off. We haven't watched Series 2 yet. We'll keep hoping.Notes on the DVDs: An earlier reviewer was quite correct in saying the colors are somewhat washed out. I would not say, then, that this series has been ""digitally restored"". But I'm not perfectionist on such things.The ""Extra Features"" are pretty much worthless. Don't even bother.

717174,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,B00006IUHL,"Tiggah ""the Anglophile""","[85, 85]","Set during WW2 on the German-occupied British Channel Island of Guernsey, just a few miles off the coast of France, Enemy at the Door is a compelling, gripping, riveting period drama.  I am not a huge fan myself of military drama in general; however, this series captivated our entire family to the point where we eagerly awaited each successive episode.  The series was produced between 1977 and 1980, and it is of the same ilk as Upstairs Downstairs, The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which took place in part during the first world war), and Danger UXB.  In short, if you've enjoyed any of those series, you will certainly enjoy this one--whether or not you have a particular interest in military drama.Like the aforementioned shows, Enemy at the Door deals with the subject of war (and in this case the occupation) from a very human and personal perspective; in short, it is not a show about tactics, manoeuvres, and the war from a military perspective.  The series centres around the lives of two families:  The Martels and the Porteouses.  Firstly, there is Dr. Martel, the local physician who is involved in committee work and bridges the gap between the islanders and the governing Germans.  Martel is joined by his wife and his strong-willed, fiercely anti-German daughter, Clare.  The Martels also have a son, Clive, a British soldier off fighting in the war.  The Porteous household consists of Peter, a young farmer and close friend of the Martels who's eager to do his bit as a loyal Brit despite living in occupied territory, and Peter's wheelchair-bound mother.  Each episode is a complete, independent story, though there is, as one would expect, carry through of the underlying stories as the war progresses.  Other characters come and go, some to be seen only for one episode.Though the series revolves around the islanders and their plights and predicaments, there are a few high-ranking German officers who are also regulars.  Most notably, the man in charge of governing the island, and Dr. Martel's liaison, is Major Richter, a stern but relatively fair man.  He's in an unenviable position, forced to make decisions requiring the wisdom of Solomon at times.  Then there is the chief of police, Oberleutnant Kluge.  A shrewd and very capable bloodhound, he's a hard man who will stand for no nonsense, neither from the islanders nor from the German soldiers.  Things get particularly tense, however, whenever the elite German SS get involved, and their presence on the island is represented by the cruel, devious, and hard-as-nails Reinicke.  Reinicke is Hitler's man, and whilst Richter, as head of the military unit on the island, is technically Reinicke's superior, Reinicke is dangerous and not a man to be crossed.  Ironically, though the enemy of the Germans is technically the native island population, one cannot help feeling that the real enemy of the German military is the SS.Both this boxed set and the second one consist of thirteen 50-minute episodes each, for a total of 26 episodes.  The series bears some similarity to the recently produced Island at War, and certainly if you've enjoyed Island at War you will enjoy Enemy at the Door.  Further, you needn't worry (as I did) that this series may be somewhat repetitious.  There are some similarities, but only initially (ie. in the first two or three episodes).  More to the point, although I saw Island at War prior to Enemy at the Door and although I enjoyed the former series (brief though it was),  I have no hesitation in saying that I greatly preferred Enemy at the Door.  Like Upstairs Downstairs or Danger UXB, what this series may lack in slick production values it more than makes up for in quality.  In short, this is an impeccably-acted, compelling, riveting series with tightly-written, well-crafted storylines that keep a person glued to the show from start to finish, and with 26 episodes the series has been given the necessary time to really develop.

717175,A32LGUD2EF3IEE,B00006IUHL,"""vanhubris""","[7, 7]","If you're looking for great combat action with acompanying mayhem and destruction--this series probably isn't what you're looking for.  While classified as a drama--it's really more of a soap opera in a world war II setting.  I normally don't care for soaps--but this one is done very well.  Some characters aren't used as well as they should have been--John Nettles, for example, appears in only one episode as a policeman investigating black market activities-and though he's a bit younger than Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby--he plays the part in a very similar style.  One of the better episodes involves a young German soldier who is accused of rape-although from what we are shown-he is only guilty of poor judgement coupled with a typical young mans testosterone--but his &quot;punishment&quot; is a very moving moment.Another fine episode involves a young German named Eric who falls in love with a British girl, but the German command opposes his interest in her-and he winds up transferred to the Russian front.  Of the Germans-Alfred Burke as Major Richter and John Malcolm as Oberleutnant Kluge are actually two of the more likeable characters--while Simon Cadell as Hauptmann Reinecke makes an almost perfect villain.  The British are mainly represented by the Martel family, Peter Porteous and his invalid mother.  All in all, I give this series a high recommendation, well worth the cost--there are a total of 13 episodes, each roughly 55 minutes in length and though some episodes are clearly better than others--all are interesting and well acted",4,a great soap/drama,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,1566,"[""'re"", 'looking', 'great', 'combat', 'action', 'acompanying', 'mayhem', 'destruction', 'series', 'probably', ""n't"", 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'classified', 'drama', 'really', 'more', 'soap', 'opera', 'world', 'war', 'II', 'setting', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'soaps', 'one', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'as', 'well', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'John', 'Nettles', 'example', 'only', 'one', 'episode', 'policeman', 'investigating', 'black', 'market', 'activities-and', 'bit', 'younger', 'Detective', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Barnaby', 'part', 'very', 'similar', 'style', 'One', 'better', 'episodes', 'young', 'German', 'soldier', 'who', 'accused', 'rape-although', 'what', 'are', 'shown-he', 'only', 'guilty', 'poor', 'judgement', 'coupled', 'typical', 'young', 'mans', 'testosterone', 'quot', 'punishment', 'quot', 'very', 'moving', 'moment.Another', 'fine', 'episode', 'young', 'German', 'named', 'Eric', 'who', 'love', 'British', 'girl', 'German', 'command', 'interest', 'her-and', 'up', 'transferred', 'Russian', 'front', 'Germans-Alfred', 'Burke', 'Major', 'Richter', 'John', 'Malcolm', 'Oberleutnant', 'Kluge', 'are', 'actually', 'two', 'more', 'likeable', 'characters', 'Simon', 'Cadell', 'Hauptmann', 'Reinecke', 'almost', 'perfect', 'villain', 'British', 'are', 'mainly', 'represented', 'Martel', 'family', 'Peter', 'Porteous', 'invalid', 'mother', 'give', 'series', 'high', 'recommendation', 'well', 'cost', 'are', 'total', '13', 'episodes', 'roughly', '55', 'minutes', 'length', 'episodes', 'are', 'clearly', 'better', 'others', 'are', 'interesting', 'well', 'acted']",N/A
