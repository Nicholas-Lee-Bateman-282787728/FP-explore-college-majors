250060,A3SZVPYMNUSS35,6301331389,"Deacon Blues ""DeaconBlues""","[0, 0]","Middle Age Crazy starring Bruce Dern and Ann Margeret is truly an underappreciated masterpiece.  The film tells the story of a moderately successful man going through the mid-life crisis that all of us face, or will face if we live long enough.  The story is completely believable, and insets of the central character's (Bobby Lee Burnett) day dreams are hillarious.  When he is at his son's high school graduation, and he is watching the class valedectorian giving the same old speech about ""We are the future...""  Bobby Lee Burnett begins to daydream, suddenly it is him on the podium giving the speech, and he tells the TRUTH about growing old, ""stay 17 forever!""  Even today, after have seen it many times, I still laugh at Bobby Lee Burnett's wonderful daydreams and speeches.  This movie needs to be available on DVD, it is truly one that every good film library should have.",5,"Timeless classic, great movie!",1320364800,"11 4, 2011",2011,881,"['Middle', 'Age', 'Crazy', 'starring', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'Ann', 'Margeret', 'truly', 'underappreciated', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'story', 'moderately', 'successful', 'man', 'going', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'face', 'will', 'face', 'live', 'long', 'enough', 'story', 'completely', 'believable', 'insets', 'central', 'character', 'Bobby', 'Lee', 'Burnett', 'day', 'dreams', 'are', 'hillarious', 'When', 'son', 'high', 'school', 'graduation', 'watching', 'class', 'valedectorian', 'giving', 'same', 'old', 'speech', 'are', 'future', 'Bobby', 'Lee', 'Burnett', 'daydream', 'suddenly', 'podium', 'giving', 'speech', 'TRUTH', 'growing', 'old', 'stay', '17', 'forever', 'Even', 'today', 'have', 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'still', 'laugh', 'Bobby', 'Lee', 'Burnett', 'wonderful', 'daydreams', 'speeches', 'movie', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'truly', 'one', 'good', 'film', 'library', 'should', 'have']",Middle Age Crazy VHS

250062,A37B3O457INKEA,6301331389,Peter Kenney,"[9, 9]",MIDDLE AGE CRAZY is one unforgettable movie and Bruce Dern is every ordinary guy just entering his own mid-life crisis. Of course not every man has a nutty wife like the loveable dimwit played by Ann-Margaret.It is Dern's private thoughts portrayed so humorously which help to make the film memorable. My view of high school graduations will never again be the same. I give the movie five stars partly because it contains many scenes which are still indelibly etched in my mind even after twenty years.,5,High School Graduations Will Never Again Seem The Same.,1041465600,"01 2, 2003",2003,502,"['MIDDLE', 'AGE', 'CRAZY', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'movie', 'Bruce', 'Dern', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'just', 'entering', 'own', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'course', 'not', 'man', 'nutty', 'wife', 'loveable', 'dimwit', 'played', 'Ann-Margaret.It', 'Dern', 'private', 'thoughts', 'portrayed', 'so', 'humorously', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'memorable', 'view', 'high', 'school', 'graduations', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'same', 'give', 'movie', 'five', 'stars', 'partly', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'still', 'indelibly', 'etched', 'mind', 'even', 'twenty', 'years']",Middle Age Crazy VHS
250063,A2TI67VB6TDWF5,6301331389,Richard P. Mayhew,"[20, 20]",".... The story revolves around a Texas man turning 40 and all the changes in his life that go along with this unpleasant milestone. His father dies, his son refuses to go to college because he wants to marry his girlfriend, he needs to find a home for his now widowed mother, his business is growing too fast for him to manage and his wife is making a big deal out of his turning 40, even counting her orgasms by screaming &quot;Bingo&quot; to compare their sex life now with that of their high school days,by the way Ann Margaret still looks hot in this one. The dream scenes that Dern has are classic, the speech at his son's high school graduation will have you nodding in understood approval &quot;give them back their damn diplomas, give them back their silly ... hats and stay 18 for the rest of your life&quot;, or the one where his son's girlfriend is coming on to him while the song Good Girls Don't is playing or the one where his dead father &quot;sentences&quot; him to be the daddy, everyones daddy for the rest of his life, and of course the killer Porsche 928 scene where he is blasting down the highway with a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader on his arm passing Corvettes and giving the finger to the Highway Patrol (now who has not daydreamed of that!).....; or to tell your boss to stick it up his ..., or scream aloud to the heavens &quot;I don't want to be the daddy&quot;...well this movie explores every bad thing and thankfully every good thing that goes along with the infamous midlife crisis. I was 16 when I first saw this film and now I am 36...holy smokes I am about to become the Dern charcter, I'd better go find a Cowgirl fast and trade my Ford for a fancy foreign sport car!
