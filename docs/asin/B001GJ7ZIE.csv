I don't know and I'm not sure I care, but I still found this DVD enjoyable for the fabulous Scandinavian scenery, the romantic history and the feeling of adventure in first-hand discovery.With the documentarians, we explore old castles, monasteries and caves, looking for pentangles and snaky iconography, mostly by sea, since this is how one gets around in Norway.This isn't science, and the ""hidden"" symbols this film claims to uncover seem thin at best, but I enjoyed the journey so much that didn't bother me.  Especially for Viking fans, and I don't mean the football team.",3,Loved this film--maybe not the way it was intended,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,684,"['world', 'once', 'ruled', 'serpent', 'cult', 'Do', 'still', 'exist', 'Viking/Celtic', 'snake-worshippers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'care', 'still', 'found', 'DVD', 'enjoyable', 'fabulous', 'Scandinavian', 'scenery', 'romantic', 'history', 'feeling', 'adventure', 'first-hand', 'discovery.With', 'documentarians', 'explore', 'old', 'castles', 'monasteries', 'caves', 'looking', 'pentangles', 'snaky', 'iconography', 'mostly', 'sea', 'how', 'one', 'around', 'Norway.This', ""n't"", 'science', 'hidden', 'film', 'uncover', 'seem', 'thin', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'journey', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Especially', 'Viking', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'football', 'team']",The Viking Serpent; Secrets of the Celtic Church in Norway and Sacred Pentagram Geometry

It's amazing how much they knew, and how their symbolism is still very relevant today. 666 is no less relevant today than it was in the Vikings day.

I had no idea that Viking Kings and the Celtic Church were involved together.  It also felt a bit like a scavenger hunt as we explored old castles, caves and monasteries looking for symbols of ""good and evil"".  Of course, this documentary doesn't claim to be absolute scientific fact, but it was still interesting hearing the theories presented about snakes, pentagrams and the number 666.
