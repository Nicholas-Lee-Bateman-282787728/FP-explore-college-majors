I haven't watched the show before but have heard great things about it and I am looking forward to seeing it. I priced the seasons here on amazon and it comes out to $88.56 for all 5 so why is it priced $109.99 for pre-order and 199.98 for the full price? Am I missing something? If this is different or better in any way can someone please let me know.",2,What's with the price??,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2014,551,"[""'m"", 'quite', 'confused', 'picture', 'just', '5', 'seasons', 'put', '1', 'cover', 'box', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'anything', 'different', 'what', 'would', 'get', 'bought', 'individually', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'show', 'have', 'heard', 'great', 'things', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'priced', 'seasons', 'here', 'amazon', 'out', '88.56', '5', 'so', 'why', 'priced', '109.99', 'pre-order', '199.98', 'full', 'price', 'missing', 'something', 'different', 'better', 'way', 'can', 'someone', 'please', 'let', 'know']",Warehouse 13: The Complete Series
1691948,A3GXPVF1WGCZMK,B00HSSZKAW,"Matt Harnick ""Discworld Junkie""","[9, 17]","Warehouse 13 has been one of the best things Syfy has done since changing its name. If you haven't seen it, think &#34;Friday The 13th:The Series&#34; from the 1990s with a bit of Rod Serling mixed in. As with Eureka, it got a bit sillier as time went on, but unlike the former series it never lost that edge of seriousness which makes for really good science-fantasy. As we prepare to witness the final demise of the series (if not the Warehouse itself - which I fervently hope doesn't happen as it will allow for a possible reboot in the future) I'll be sad to see it go. In this age when sci-fi-fantasy is dominated by horror subjects such as werewolves, vampires, ghosts and zombies or violent space-operas (the new Battlestar Galactica comes to mind), there are preacious few shows which really appeal to the classic sci-fi-fantasy buff. Once this is gone, great (or even good) sci-fi-fantasy will only be available through BBC featues such as &#34;Doctor Who&#34; and &#34;Orphan Black&#34;. Bottom line: if you knew and liked &#34;Friday The 13th: The Series&#34; you'll like &#34;Warehouse 13&#34;. And if you liked Eureka, there are the infamous Claudia/Fargo crossover stories.That being said, I'm not sure what is in this complete edition which is not available in the original offerings of seasons 1-4 (and of course the soon-to-be-released season 5) thats worth having especially at this price. If you have held off buying, it's probably worth your money but if you're like most of us who have been buying the series as it was made available, there's nothing worth the large price tag here. At least I don't think so.SPOILER ALERT:Do Not Read Beyond Here If You Want To Be SurprisedThe underlying plot of &#34;Warehouse 13&#34; follows the adventures of two U.S. Secret Service Agents who accidentally witness a Warehouse snag in progress. They are immediately recruited and find themselves collecting artifacts with supernatural properties and thus carrying on a legacy which goes back to the dawn of human civilization. Artifacts encountered include Poe's pen and diary, Lewis Caroll's mirror, Lovecraft's silver key among others. The actual building and much of its attendant hard- and software are the combined brainchildren of Nicola Tesla, Albert Einstein and M.C. Escher. And agents carry stun-pistols called Teslas and communicators called Farnsworths, named for their respective inventors.Although the show continues to follow the original two SS Agents, Pete Latimer and Mika Bering, we also follow the lives of head-agent Artie, junior-agent Claudia Donovan and even the mysterious Mrs. Fredrick, the keeper of the warehouse.In this series there is no clear definition between &#34;Good&#34; and &#34;Evil&#34; - every character is a mixed bag. Even the fun-loving, child-like Pete is battling alchoholism and has his dark, solidly grown-up moments. And every character faces his or her demons at some point, usually as the result of contact with an artifact. And every season seems to end with a catastrophic cliff-hanger which is always resolved but with lasting consequences, a far cry from the usual &#34;we fix the problem in the first episode of the next season and move on&#34; formula of other series.",3,A Great Series - But ...,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",2014,3233,"['13', 'been', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'Syfy', 'done', 'changing', 'name', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'think', '34', 'Friday', '13th', 'Series', '34', '1990s', 'bit', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'mixed', 'Eureka', 'got', 'bit', 'sillier', 'time', 'went', 'former', 'series', 'never', 'lost', 'edge', 'seriousness', 'really', 'good', 'science-fantasy', 'prepare', 'witness', 'final', 'demise', 'series', 'not', 'Warehouse', 'fervently', 'hope', ""n't"", 'happen', 'will', 'allow', 'possible', 'reboot', 'future', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sad', 'see', 'go', 'age', 'when', 'sci-fi-fantasy', 'dominated', 'horror', 'subjects', 'such', 'werewolves', 'vampires', 'ghosts', 'zombies', 'violent', 'space-operas', 'new', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'mind', 'are', 'preacious', 'few', 'shows', 'really', 'classic', 'sci-fi-fantasy', 'buff', 'Once', 'gone', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'sci-fi-fantasy', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'available', 'BBC', 'featues', 'such', '34', 'Doctor', 'Who', '34', '34', 'Orphan', 'Black', '34', 'Bottom', 'line', 'knew', 'liked', '34', 'Friday', '13th', 'Series', '34', ""'ll"", 'like', '34', 'Warehouse', '13', '34', 'liked', 'Eureka', 'are', 'infamous', 'Claudia/Fargo', 'crossover', 'stories.That', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'complete', 'edition', 'not', 'available', 'original', 'offerings', 'seasons', '1-4', 'course', 'soon-to-be-released', 'season', '5', 'thats', 'worth', 'having', 'especially', 'price', 'have', 'held', 'off', 'buying', 'probably', 'worth', 'money', ""'re"", 'most', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'buying', 'series', 'was', 'made', 'available', 'nothing', 'large', 'price', 'tag', 'here', 'least', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Do', 'Not', 'Read', 'Beyond', 'Here', 'Want', 'Be', 'SurprisedThe', 'underlying', 'plot', '34', 'Warehouse', '13', '34', 'adventures', 'two', 'U.S.', 'Secret', 'Service', 'Agents', 'who', 'accidentally', 'witness', 'Warehouse', 'snag', 'progress', 'are', 'immediately', 'recruited', 'find', 'collecting', 'artifacts', 'supernatural', 'properties', 'thus', 'carrying', 'legacy', 'back', 'dawn', 'human', 'civilization', 'Artifacts', 'encountered', 'include', 'Poe', 'pen', 'diary', 'Lewis', 'Caroll', 'mirror', 'Lovecraft', 'silver', 'key', 'others', 'actual', 'building', 'much', 'attendant', 'hard-', 'software', 'are', 'combined', 'brainchildren', 'Nicola', 'Tesla', 'Albert', 'Einstein', 'M.C', 'Escher', 'agents', 'carry', 'stun-pistols', 'called', 'Teslas', 'communicators', 'called', 'Farnsworths', 'named', 'respective', 'show', 'follow', 'original', 'two', 'SS', 'Agents', 'Pete', 'Latimer', 'Mika', 'Bering', 'also', 'follow', 'lives', 'head-agent', 'Artie', 'junior-agent', 'Claudia', 'Donovan', 'even', 'mysterious', 'Mrs.', 'Fredrick', 'keeper', 'warehouse.In', 'series', 'clear', 'definition', '34', 'Good', '34', '34', 'Evil', '34', 'character', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Even', 'fun-loving', 'child-like', 'Pete', 'battling', 'alchoholism', 'dark', 'solidly', 'grown-up', 'moments', 'character', 'demons', 'point', 'usually', 'result', 'contact', 'artifact', 'season', 'end', 'catastrophic', 'cliff-hanger', 'always', 'resolved', 'lasting', 'consequences', 'far', 'cry', 'usual', '34', 'fix', 'problem', 'first', 'episode', 'next', 'season', 'move', '34', 'formula', 'other', 'series']",Warehouse 13: The Complete Series
