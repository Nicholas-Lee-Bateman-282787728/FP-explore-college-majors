915500,A1LBGXE29GG1IR,B0009X7650,"Coffee Addicted Writer's Reviews ""Billy""","[2, 2]","This is not a movie! Goosebumps was a television series in the mid 1990s that aired on Fox and was based on the book written by R.L. Stine! The series was filmed in Canada on a low-budget, which explains the bad acting and special effects.There earlier DVD releases, like this one, were horrible as they don't contain menus and the picture quality is slightly below average.Here we get two episodes, The House of No Return and The Haunted House Game. In The House of No Return, Chris is new to town and is desperately wanting to make new friends, even if it means going into a haunted house.Then in The Haunted House Game, a few kids discover a strange board game in a creepy old house. Once they start playing, they unleash several ghosts.Both of these episodes are about 22 minutes in length. Kids will enjoy watching them around Halloween.",4,Two Haunted House Tales,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,842,"['not', 'movie', 'Goosebumps', 'was', 'television', 'series', 'mid', '1990s', 'aired', 'Fox', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'written', 'R.L', 'Stine', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'Canada', 'low-budget', 'bad', 'acting', 'special', 'effects.There', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'one', 'were', 'horrible', 'do', ""n't"", 'contain', 'menus', 'picture', 'quality', 'slightly', 'average.Here', 'get', 'two', 'episodes', 'House', 'No', 'Return', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Game', 'House', 'No', 'Return', 'Chris', 'new', 'town', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'even', 'going', 'haunted', 'house.Then', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Game', 'few', 'kids', 'discover', 'strange', 'board', 'game', 'creepy', 'old', 'house', 'start', 'playing', 'unleash', 'several', 'ghosts.Both', 'episodes', 'are', '22', 'minutes', 'length', 'Kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Halloween']",Goosebumps: Scary House
