After getting the chance to watch this movie I must admit I was completly wrong. This movie is great. It's a fun comedy with great chemistry between the actors.The adventure starts by introducing all four characters. Tim Allen, John Travolta, William Macy, and Martin Lawerence. Each character brings something special to the movie. I can say most of the movie I was laughing at loud because most of the humor is physical. There isn't a deep involved storyline so you don't have to worry about keeping track of much.I would say this movie can be viewed by the entire family as it has few profanities and very little physical violence that is mainly comical.

1075554,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000QFCD7W,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","Okay, so I did not want to see this movie when it came out.  Of the entire cast the only actor I actually enjoyed on a regular basis was William H. Macy and so I didn't have the highest of hopes for this film.  That said, I was blown away with how funny this movie really is.  I mean, I was laughing just about the whole way through, and while Macy probably gives the funniest performance here the entire cast really hold their own as well.  One of my initial arguments going into this movie was that believing Martin Lawrence would be friends with the likes of Allen, Travolta and Macy was a bit far fetched.  They just seem to be cut from a different mold.  I was so very wrong.  Lawrence really left his `Martin' days behind here and has advanced as a comedian.  He's matured and is so believable here.  All four actors really fit well together, and that is a big plus to the enjoyment of the film.The film follows four friends, Woody, Doug, Bobby and Dudley as they take off on the adventure of their lives to find themselves, escape the pressures of their lives and release the stress that just keeps building.  Woody is going through a nasty divorce from his supermodel wife although he refuses to admit anything is wrong to his friends.  Doug is facing stress from work and just needs to escape.  Bobby has family issues to work through, namely the lack of support from his wife and mother-in-law and Dudley just really needs a woman.  Together they make up `The Wild Hogs', their idea of a motorcycle gang, and so it's with leather jackets tightly fastened and Harley's between their legs that they set off for self discovery.  Once they leave for the open road though any and everything you can imagine goes seriously wrong.The gags within the film may not be all fresh and or original (I don't know why every comedy feels the need for the homosexual gags...sure some are funny but they just seem to overdo it at times) but the execution is well thought out and there are plenty of redeeming moments to help you forgive the missteps.  I love John C. McGinley on `Scrubs' but here he did nothing for me.  His character was just too over the top (although I did laugh at some of his scenes).Two supporting actors that are worth their weight here are Marisa Tomei and Ray Liotta.  As Jack, Ray completely steals the scenes he embodies.  His rebel gang leader is so harsh yet so hysterically on point.  You hate him yet want to see more of him.  As Maggie, Marisa is confident, endearing and so beautiful.  Although one may gawk at someone of her level of beauty falling for William H. Macy, but they play this side plot off so well it becomes very believable.There are plenty of scenes within `Wild Hogs' that will make the viewer chuckle and then plenty to evoke full on belly laughs.  A note to all who have not seen this film, as funny as it all is you MUST wait till the credits begin to roll for the biggest surprise.  Lets just say a gag involving a real motorcycle gang and a spoof on `Extreme Makeover: Home Edition' had me in tears it was so funny.  Seriously, it alone makes this movie worth OWNING.  So, in the end, I was wrong about `Wild Hogs'.  I expected to leave the theater pointing at my wife (who insisted we go) and saying ""I told you so"" as we left disgusted at the waste of time.  Instead I actually think I enjoyed the film more than she did.  I highly recommend this film.  Sure it's not perfect but it's a nice twist on the coming of age film sporting some really nice comedic performances by the entire cast.  And like I said, that closing scene is just priceless, truly and utterly priceless.",4,"Not what I expected, and that's a very good thing...",1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,3625,"['Okay', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'entire', 'cast', 'only', 'actor', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'regular', 'basis', 'was', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'highest', 'hopes', 'film', 'said', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'funny', 'movie', 'really', 'mean', 'was', 'laughing', 'just', 'whole', 'way', 'Macy', 'probably', 'funniest', 'performance', 'here', 'entire', 'cast', 'really', 'hold', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'initial', 'arguments', 'going', 'movie', 'was', 'believing', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'would', 'be', 'friends', 'likes', 'Allen', 'Travolta', 'Macy', 'was', 'bit', 'far', 'fetched', 'just', 'seem', 'be', 'cut', 'different', 'mold', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'wrong', 'Lawrence', 'really', 'left', 'Martin', 'days', 'here', 'advanced', 'comedian', 'matured', 'so', 'believable', 'here', 'four', 'actors', 'really', 'fit', 'well', 'together', 'big', 'plus', 'enjoyment', 'film.The', 'film', 'four', 'friends', 'Woody', 'Doug', 'Bobby', 'Dudley', 'take', 'off', 'adventure', 'lives', 'find', 'pressures', 'lives', 'release', 'stress', 'just', 'building', 'Woody', 'going', 'nasty', 'divorce', 'supermodel', 'wife', 'admit', 'anything', 'wrong', 'friends', 'Doug', 'facing', 'stress', 'work', 'just', 'needs', 'escape', 'Bobby', 'family', 'issues', 'work', 'namely', 'lack', 'support', 'wife', 'mother-in-law', 'Dudley', 'just', 'really', 'woman', 'Together', 'make', 'up', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'idea', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'leather', 'jackets', 'tightly', 'fastened', 'Harley', 'legs', 'set', 'off', 'self', 'discovery', 'leave', 'open', 'road', 'everything', 'can', 'imagine', 'seriously', 'wrong.The', 'gags', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'fresh', 'original', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'comedy', 'need', 'homosexual', 'gags', 'sure', 'are', 'funny', 'just', 'seem', 'overdo', 'times', 'execution', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'are', 'plenty', 'redeeming', 'moments', 'help', 'forgive', 'missteps', 'love', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Scrubs', 'here', 'did', 'nothing', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'top', 'did', 'laugh', 'scenes', '.Two', 'supporting', 'actors', 'are', 'worth', 'weight', 'here', 'are', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'Jack', 'Ray', 'completely', 'scenes', 'rebel', 'gang', 'leader', 'so', 'harsh', 'yet', 'so', 'hysterically', 'point', 'hate', 'yet', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'Maggie', 'Marisa', 'confident', 'endearing', 'so', 'beautiful', 'one', 'may', 'gawk', 'someone', 'level', 'beauty', 'falling', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'play', 'side', 'plot', 'so', 'well', 'very', 'believable.There', 'are', 'plenty', 'scenes', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'will', 'make', 'viewer', 'chuckle', 'then', 'plenty', 'evoke', 'full', 'belly', 'laughs', 'note', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'film', 'as', 'funny', 'MUST', 'wait', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'just', 'say', 'gag', 'involving', 'real', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'spoof', 'Extreme', 'Makeover', 'Home', 'Edition', 'had', 'tears', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'Seriously', 'alone', 'movie', 'OWNING', 'So', 'end', 'was', 'wrong', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'expected', 'leave', 'theater', 'pointing', 'wife', 'who', 'insisted', 'go', 'saying', 'told', 'so', 'left', 'disgusted', 'waste', 'time', 'Instead', 'actually', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'did', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Sure', 'not', 'perfect', 'nice', 'twist', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'sporting', 'really', 'nice', 'comedic', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'said', 'closing', 'scene', 'just', 'priceless', 'truly', 'utterly', 'priceless']",N/A

Macy as the leads, Walt Becker's ""Wild Hogs"" should have been a first-rate comedy; instead, it is 'by-the-numbers', and surprisingly flat, relying on stereotypes and old gags in place of originality.The concept of middle-aged men hoping to recapture a zest for life on a cross-country trip has always been ripe with storytelling potential (from ""Deliverance"" to ""About Schmidt""), and making the trek on motorcycles was a terrific variation; but from the outset, something just seemed out of kilter. Travolta's cocky failure lacks any warmth, as does Allen's paunchy dentist (wasting Jill Hennessy, in the clich&eacute;d 'wise wife' role); Martin Lawrence fares better, as a plumber taking a year-long sabbatical to write, surrounded by a houseful of sharp-tongued women, but his introduction feels more like a TV sitcom than a feature film; only Macy's portrayal of a likable geek rises above his material (who would have believed he'd be funnier than Allen or Lawrence?)Relying heavily on classic rock tunes of the seventies and eighties to provide atmosphere, the film quickly introduces the stereotypical gay cop (John C. McGinley, who is making a career out of these roles), in a camping scene so ripe with homosexual innuendos that you may want to send the kids out; of course, the guys run afoul of a 'real' biker gang (headed by a superb Ray Liotta, who, with Macy, gives the best performances of the film), and eventually, they end up in a small town, where Macy finally finds love with the always terrific Marisa Tomei (why she immediately falls for him is another plot-hole in a film that is rampant with them).The film's climax, as the Hogs takes on Liotta's gang, in the town, again offers comic potential, but, other than a terrific verbal exchange between Liotta and Macy (""Shoot his legs!"" ""I'm a computer programmer, I don't need legs"" ""Shoot his hands!""), it is completely predictable (even a surprise cameo isn't really much of a surprise). Worst of all, the film's resolution doesn't show any improvement in the lives of the four friends (even Macy returns to Cincinnati, amazingly enough).Director Becker, in the Special Features, said that he bought and sold Harleys to pay his way through college, so the script was a 'natural' for him, and that he let the cast improvise, extensively, since they were such 'pros'...I wish he'd demonstrated some of that Harley expertise in the film, and had asserted more control directing his cast...it might have made for a better film!",2,"Great Cast, Disappointing Comedy...",1191715200,"10 7, 2007",2007,2557,"['John', 'Travolta', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'leads', 'Walt', 'Becker', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first-rate', 'comedy', 'instead', ""'by-the-numbers"", 'surprisingly', 'flat', 'relying', 'stereotypes', 'old', 'gags', 'place', 'originality.The', 'concept', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'hoping', 'recapture', 'zest', 'life', 'cross-country', 'trip', 'always', 'been', 'ripe', 'storytelling', 'potential', 'Deliverance', 'Schmidt', 'making', 'trek', 'motorcycles', 'was', 'terrific', 'variation', 'outset', 'something', 'just', 'seemed', 'kilter', 'Travolta', 'cocky', 'failure', 'warmth', 'Allen', 'paunchy', 'dentist', 'wasting', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'clich', 'eacute', ""'wise"", 'wife', 'role', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'better', 'plumber', 'taking', 'year-long', 'sabbatical', 'write', 'surrounded', 'houseful', 'sharp-tongued', 'women', 'introduction', 'more', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'feature', 'film', 'only', 'Macy', 'portrayal', 'likable', 'geek', 'rises', 'material', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'believed', ""'d"", 'be', 'funnier', 'Allen', 'Lawrence', 'Relying', 'heavily', 'classic', 'rock', 'tunes', 'seventies', 'eighties', 'provide', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'quickly', 'stereotypical', 'gay', 'cop', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'who', 'making', 'career', 'roles', 'camping', 'scene', 'so', 'ripe', 'homosexual', 'innuendos', 'may', 'want', 'send', 'kids', 'out', 'course', 'guys', 'run', 'afoul', ""'real"", 'biker', 'gang', 'headed', 'superb', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'who', 'Macy', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'eventually', 'end', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'Macy', 'finally', 'love', 'always', 'terrific', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', 'why', 'immediately', 'plot-hole', 'film', 'rampant', '.The', 'film', 'climax', 'Hogs', 'Liotta', 'gang', 'town', 'again', 'comic', 'potential', 'other', 'terrific', 'verbal', 'exchange', 'Liotta', 'Macy', 'Shoot', 'legs', ""'m"", 'computer', 'programmer', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'legs', 'Shoot', 'hands', 'completely', 'predictable', 'even', 'surprise', 'cameo', ""n't"", 'really', 'much', 'surprise', 'Worst', 'film', 'resolution', ""n't"", 'show', 'improvement', 'lives', 'four', 'friends', 'even', 'Macy', 'returns', 'Cincinnati', 'amazingly', 'enough', '.Director', 'Becker', 'Special', 'Features', 'said', 'bought', 'sold', 'Harleys', 'pay', 'way', 'college', 'script', 'was', ""'natural"", 'let', 'cast', 'improvise', 'extensively', 'were', 'such', ""'pros"", 'wish', ""'d"", 'demonstrated', 'Harley', 'expertise', 'film', 'had', 'asserted', 'more', 'control', 'directing', 'cast', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'film']",N/A

It seems like a great idea and a can't miss premise. You get four quality Hollywood stars (Tim Allen, William H. Macy, Martin Lawrence and John Travolta). They'll play men with various flaws who love to ride motorcycles. In an attempt to salvage the glory of their younger years, they decide to go on a motorcycle road trip. You throw in a strong supporting cast with Marissa Tomei, Ray Liotta, and one of the ""others"" from Lost (MC Gainey) and you are sure to have a hit on your hands. This movie actually did quite well in the spring 2007 box office, but as I watched, I could see how each scene looked funny on paper, but the actual on screen performance left a lot to be desired.On a whole, this movie was humorous, and even a few times laugh outloud funny. More often however, the jokes seemed force, the cast seemed to be trying to hard. Tim Allen played the same character he always plays, this time a middle-aged dentist who hasn't done anything out of the ordinary in years. Martin Lawrence is a plumber dominated by his lawyer wife, and William H. Macy is computer geek who has no clue about the opposite sex. John Travolta is a guy that has the supermodel wife and the nice house. His friends, however, don't know that his wife is divorcing him and he is flat broke. Once on the road trip, then men encounter various minor problems before encountering a ""real"" biker gang, led by Ray Liotta. Of course, this is the conflict around whicht the plot revolves.John Travolta is the weakest link in the cast, perhaps through no fault of his own. He singlehandedly does something to the other biker gang, and then for no reason, decides he can't tell his friends what he did. This leads to the conflict, and the whole time if he had just told his friends what he did, then the conflict could have been avoided. The looks on Travolta's face were painful to watch as he agonized over the secret he harbored.This movie is full of cartoonish violence and PG13 type bad language. I thought the closing credits where Extreme Makeover Home Edition was parodied was one of the best parts of the film. I can't recommend anyone buying this movie until they've at least rented it and checked it out.

Four men, who have been friends for years and who suit up in leather and ride to the local bar and grill regularly to hang out, suddenly wonder what happened to their lives.  They all realize, one by one, that they've hit middle age and fallen into a rut, and they decide to take a cross country trip on their bikes to get out of it.This is one of the more entertaining movies I've seen in a while.  What made it for me, however, was not the plot or even the comedic moments but rather the excellent performances by a great cast.  John Travolta plays the cool-guy-in-a-midlife-crisis role perfectly, and Tim Allen pulls off his when-did-my-life-get-so-bland part flawlessly as well.  Throw in great performances by Martin Lawrence, a man desperate to get out from under his overbearing wife's thumb, and William H. Macy, a geek who hopes he can FINALLY do something that will make him cool, and you've got a great group of main characters.Macy's performance is probably the most surprisingly good of the bunch.  He's downright hilarious in this movie as the 'rebel nerd.'  And Ray Liotta is excellent as the villain, the antagonist who tries to refuse this group of ""Wild Hogs"" their right to ride on the grounds that they're not real bikers.This is a very funny movie and is sure to keep you entertained.

He only came alive briefly when he sneaked behind enemy lines to cut the gas lines of the Del Fuego's motorcycles, causing their hang out to go up in flames. Sorry if I spoiled the suspense.I never saw it, but I heard that he made a movie based on the science fiction writing of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, that could be worse than The Wild Hogs, but it is hard to imagine how. Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000. I gave The Wild Hogs 2 stars, just in case this other Travolta vehicle is actually worse. A 1 star film has to be like, Plan 9 From Outer Space.Travolta was great in Pulp Fiction. Saturday Night Fever, even. Urban Cowboy? All right, I suppose. He was good as Vinnie Barbarino on Welcome Back, Kotter--though constantly overshadowed by the scene stealing Horshak. He might have even been good in the film version of the musical version of the film Hairspray. Though I doubt he topped the divine performance of Divine, even with the help of co-star Christopher (More Cowbell!!!!) Walken. But in a lame movie like The Wild Hogs, Travolta really stuck out as the lamest of the lame.I would say that Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence were at a slightly higher level of acting then they displayed in their sit coms, Home Improvement and Martin. That is appropriate for this kind of movie, so they did their jobs adequately. William H. Macy is, according to several women who offered their opinons unsolicited, one of the least attractive men to ever trod planet Earth. I guess when he gets the girl, we should all be cheering him on. The woman he falls for was really the best actor, ever, just to make you believe that she liked him. Ray Liotta makes for a scary villain. Cameo by Peter Fonda--good to see him. He hasn't done much since Easy Rider. Jack Nicholson has eclipsed him ten fold, and even Dennis Hopper has done more since Easy Rider. The woman who plays Chris Rock's mom on Everybody Hates Chris played Martin Lawrence's wife. I like her, but this stupid film wasted her talent.I was just reading about the Oscars, and how the films that get the awards usually aren't the ones that do well at the Box Office. With few exceptions, like Titanic, they rarely overlap. Of this year's nominees for best picture, Juno actually did the best at the box office. It's pro life theme played well in the Midwest, and it built an audience by good word-of-mouth. It was maybe 23rd or 27th. But The Wild Hogs ranked 13th or 15th at the box office. Still, I don't care. It was extremely lame. It won't win any Oscars and the critics will pan it. I am sad that a movie as lame as this would actually earn any money whatsoever.Easy RiderThe Wild OnePulp FictionWelcome Back, KotterSaturday Night FeverBattlefield EarthThe CoolerBoogie NightsFargoHairspray",2,The Mild Boars,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",2008,2840,"['John', 'Travolta', 'really', 'did', 'terrible', 'job', 'acting', 'lame', 'movie', 'only', 'came', 'alive', 'briefly', 'when', 'sneaked', 'enemy', 'lines', 'cut', 'gas', 'lines', 'Del', 'Fuego', 'motorcycles', 'causing', 'hang', 'go', 'up', 'flames', 'Sorry', 'spoiled', 'suspense.I', 'never', 'saw', 'heard', 'made', 'movie', 'based', 'science', 'fiction', 'writing', 'Scientology', 'founder', 'L.', 'Ron', 'Hubbard', 'could', 'be', 'worse', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'Saga', 'Year', '3000', 'gave', 'Wild', 'Hogs', '2', 'stars', 'just', 'case', 'other', 'Travolta', 'vehicle', 'actually', 'worse', '1', 'star', 'film', 'be', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'Space.Travolta', 'was', 'great', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'even', 'Urban', 'Cowboy', 'right', 'suppose', 'was', 'good', 'Vinnie', 'Barbarino', 'Welcome', 'Back', 'Kotter', 'constantly', 'overshadowed', 'scene', 'stealing', 'Horshak', 'might', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'good', 'film', 'version', 'musical', 'version', 'film', 'Hairspray', 'doubt', 'topped', 'divine', 'performance', 'Divine', 'even', 'help', 'co-star', 'Christopher', 'More', 'Cowbell', 'Walken', 'lame', 'movie', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'Travolta', 'really', 'stuck', 'out', 'lamest', 'lame.I', 'would', 'say', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'were', 'slightly', 'higher', 'level', 'acting', 'then', 'displayed', 'sit', 'coms', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'Martin', 'appropriate', 'kind', 'movie', 'did', 'jobs', 'adequately', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'according', 'several', 'women', 'who', 'offered', 'opinons', 'unsolicited', 'one', 'least', 'attractive', 'men', 'ever', 'trod', 'planet', 'Earth', 'guess', 'when', 'girl', 'should', 'be', 'cheering', 'woman', 'was', 'really', 'best', 'actor', 'ever', 'just', 'make', 'believe', 'liked', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'scary', 'villain', 'Cameo', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'good', 'see', ""n't"", 'done', 'much', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'eclipsed', 'ten', 'fold', 'even', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'done', 'more', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'woman', 'who', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'mom', 'Everybody', 'Hates', 'Chris', 'played', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'wife', 'stupid', 'film', 'wasted', 'talent.I', 'was', 'just', 'reading', 'Oscars', 'how', 'films', 'get', 'awards', 'usually', 'are', ""n't"", 'ones', 'do', 'well', 'Box', 'Office', 'few', 'exceptions', 'Titanic', 'rarely', 'overlap', 'year', 'nominees', 'best', 'picture', 'Juno', 'actually', 'did', 'best', 'box', 'office', 'pro', 'life', 'theme', 'played', 'well', 'Midwest', 'built', 'audience', 'good', 'word-of-mouth', 'was', 'maybe', '23rd', '27th', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'ranked', '13th', '15th', 'box', 'office', 'Still', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'extremely', 'lame', 'wo', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscars', 'critics', 'will', 'pan', 'am', 'sad', 'movie', 'as', 'lame', 'would', 'actually', 'earn', 'money', 'whatsoever.Easy', 'RiderThe', 'Wild', 'OnePulp', 'FictionWelcome', 'Back', 'KotterSaturday', 'Night', 'FeverBattlefield', 'EarthThe', 'CoolerBoogie', 'NightsFargoHairspray']",N/A

Well, unfortunately, I think this film might have missed the mark a little bit, despite having so much going for it!""Wild Hogs"" is a movie about 4 friends who experience a collective mid-life crisis, and decide to take their motorcycles (which they obviously purchased in an earlier mid-life crisis) on a cross-country road trip from Cincinnatti, Ohio, all the way to Sunny California and the Pacific ocean. Along the way they run into a myriad of troubles, including a homosexual police officer who wants to join in their ""biker"" fun, a gang of homicidal bikers (obviously the antagonists of this piece) out to destroy them (you'll know why when you watch the movie), and a small town in need of saving (from the scary bikers, of course). These obstacles, and more, test their friendship, and bring them closer together.There were a few parts that were funny or clever, but in the end I didn't feel like it was nearly as entertaining as I expected it to be (or as entertaining as others led me to believe it was). I think that some of the actors, while being great actors, were a bit of a poor fit to their characters. William H. Macy was a delight to watch -- he suited his bumbling, nerdy, nervous character very well, and he did a terrific job. John Travolta, on the other hand, I found a little irritating, even though I usually love John Travolta! I also felt the ending was a little weak. I was just expecting more than what we got, so it was hard for me watch the credits roll without thinking to myself ""huh...that was kind of stupid"".I've come to realize that whether you end up liking the movie or not largley comes down to your age (and therefore, your perspective). I watched this movie with 7 other people in the room. Four of us thought that there were a few funny parts here and there, but on the whole we were a little disappointed and kind of bored with it. Those of us who shared this opinion were ages 19, 20, 24, and 25 (respectively). But, the other 4 people in the room thought this movie was hilarious! They were constantly laughing, and they truly enjoyed this movie. Those who shared that particular opinion were ages 43, 44, 44, and 45! I think that the older generation liked this movie because it was more easily relatable to them. They understood the type of humor this movie was going for better than our younger generation did.

Not every movie is made to be an oscar contender, though if they gave awards for making me laugh this one would win. Movies should not be rated based on how original it is. I mean really? how original is any plot line anymore? since the dawn of the age of public entertainment every single story has already been conceived, what makes a movie ""original"" is either the casting or script or how they take a common story and make it unique. I live in Cincinnati, and found it funny they were bored here. I understood why lol, but in that sense it was more relatable to me. However the movie wasn't trying to break new ground, it wasn't trying to reinvent the wheel it was trying to tell a universal story (mid life crisis) and make it funny. the truly best comedies are the ones that make you laugh so hard that you forget that the same things happening to the characters are happening to you or someone u know. you know the story because you either lived it or knew someone who had, but you dont realise you are ""learning"" something, whether it's about human nature or the realities of life, because you are laughing too hard. But in the end after the credits roll you feel pretty good. and to me this was one of those movies that just leave you feeling good. All the cast members were funny and ray liotta is always great too. So just sit back and enjoy this movie, if you do try to overanalyze this movie then you are working too hard.

Put Martin ""You So Crazy"" Lawrence, John ""You So Made a Comeback in '94"" Travolta, and William ""You So Crazy with an H.""

I only wish he would grunt more like he did on that wonderful show about Home Improvements.The writing is crisp and delicious and the plot is hilariously terrific.  Because what does happen when older people decide to act like bikers?  Well (spoiler alert) comic situations start flooding out of the woodwork.  But this movie also has a heart and the message is that if you're advancing in age, you need to embrace the child within, and by child I mean someone of legal motorbicycle-riding age, preferrably with that class clearly indicated on your driver's license.If you enjoy having fun at the movies, then by all means you should get your motor running, head out on the highway, look for adventure, and then return home and add this to your Netflix queue immediately.

The story is a simple one: four middle-aged men (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy), living in Cincinnati, are feeling that life is passing them by.  The interest that joins them together are motorcycles and they were playfully dubbed ""The Wild Hogs"" complete with a leather jacket back patch that is designed by Tim Allen's wife.  However, the four buddies may look like bikers their only ride takes them around town to a local bar - until John Travolta brings up a road trip.  What follows is a comic adventure that takes the guys to California as they pretend to be bikers.Along the way the guys run into a motorcycle gang (called the Del Fuegos - which turns out to be a nice play on words) led by Jack (nicely played by Ray Liotta), who seems more outraged that the Wild Hogs dare to call themselves a motorcycle gang.  Jack's gang is the terror of the area and the local police are not match for them, and they set out to have vengeance on the Hogs.  In the final showdown between the gangs, the Hogs have to prove themselves (which, of course they do) and inspire the locals of Madrid, New Mexico to defy Jack and his gang.The film is good fun and it is clear that everyone enjoyed making the movie.  There is a brief appearance of Peter Fonda - his Easy Rider character now grandfatherly - that was a most welcome addition to the cast; it was also good to see Marisa Tomei as the owner of a diner.

Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist with high cholesterol who hasn't been on a vacation in years. Bobby (Martin Lawrence) has taken a year off his job as a plumber to write a self-help book that still isn't finished, and his wife has just arranged for him to get his old job back. Dudley (William H. Macy) is a computer programmer who can't get a date... because he freezes around women. And Woody (John Travolta) is the one they all think has it all--a gorgeous model for a wife and a high-powered job.But Woody's wife has left him, and he's lost his job, and he's broke. So he comes up with the idea for the four of them to take a cross-country bike trip.The first half of the movie is just pure fun--depicting their misadventures in beginning the trip. Then they run across the Del Fuegos, a real motorcycle gang, led by Jack (Ray Liotta). Jack takes advantage of Dudley's naivete and steals his bike. They leave, with Dudley in a rusty sidecar, but then Woody, with nothing to lose, decides to get it back.I'm not going to spoil how he does it, but from then on, Woody's on the run from the Del Fuegos, and simultaneously trying to hide that from the other Wild Hogs.The climax comes in the little town of Madrid, where they all face what's bothering them and fix their lives--or at least start to. Dudley even finds a girl (Marisa Tomei).Wild Hogs is full of laughs. And interestingly, it's not Allen and Lawrence who provide most of them. The four actors work well together, despite being vastly different types--or perhaps because of it. What made the movie even funnier for me is that we I someone who's very much like Dudley: very smart, socially inept, an inexhaustible font of trivia, but so full of goodwill and so oblivious to his effect on others that you just can't help liking him.My only quibbles are that the conflict with the Del Fuegos was resolved a little too easily, and that Dudley's romance wasn't all that believable.Mostly, it's a wonderfully feel-good movie.

Why not get together with some buds and go on a male-bonding motorcycle trip?  Let that testosterone rip, by golly.  Be cool (for maybe the first time ever).  What's so hilariously coincidental is that three of my close buds (all solidly middle-aged) just took a bike trip to the New Mexico Rockies (I was invited, but politely declined), so when I stumbled across WILD HOGS I had to pull up a chair and watch the madcap shenanigans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy gone wild.  (Yet unlike this cast, my friends didn't have a run-in with the Del Fuegos.  Darn.)The movie is silly, predictable, often lame, and decidedly over-the-top, but come on; it's still funny and entertaining--plus there is an undercurrent of midlife angst that resonates with old cusses like moi.  I especially liked the give-and-take between our heroes and the rough and ready Del Fuegos, led by a bristly Ray Liotta (who was born to play a biker gang leader).  But the Del Fuego who steals every scene he's in is the versatile Kevin Durand (who was outrageously fantastic in his brief role inSmokin' Aces); Durand's reaction, during the closing credits, when the Del Fuegos' bar was resurrected in a spoof to Home Makeover had me rolling on the floor.

A CLASSIC that will NOT leave you laughing. You will want to go out and hurt every bigot you can find!I went to see Wild Hogs and burst out laughing in the opening credits. Never stopped laughing. Travolta showed a little of his old Vinne Barbario character, for those of you who remember Welcome Back Kotter.( I loved Vinnie)SO---could all the pretentious critics out there STOP with the remarks about thin plot, mediocre acting, no charater development, inane slapstick, etc. If you MUST cling to your psuedo-intellectual superiority, aka wanna-be-upper-class bigotry, then go read The Brothers Karamazov.There is enough angst, blood, guts, fear, and horror out there in the world and the media everyday.

1075612,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000QFCD7W,Galina,"[3, 4]","Four suburban friends who have in common the love for their motorcycles and who call themselves Wild Hogs (Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, William H. Macy and John Travolta), one sunny summer morning jump on their bikes, throw away all four cell phones and leave their worries, bills, routine and safety of their subdivision behind to face the adventure and to ride from Cincinnati to California. On their way, they cross paths with a real thing, an intimidating band of New Mexico bikers known as the Del Fuegos and their bad-to-the-bone leader, Ray Liotta. Jack and his buddies do not like middle-class suburbanites -amateur bikers, and a lot of misadventures ensue as the result of their meeting.I think the movie is better than majority of critics giving it credit for. The soundtrack contains classic rock songs. Along with the ""Wild Hogs"" gang we would pass and enjoy the beautiful scenery on the way from Ohio to the Pacific coast. The movie has even a class act in the end when the obligatory Deus ex machine shows up in the small charming town Madrid, New Mexico to settle all the scores and to stop the war between Wild Hogs and Del Fuegos. Peter Fonda's appearance immediately brings to mind another cross-country motorcycle adventure that happened almost forty years ago.I would not stay in line to the theater to see this comedy there, and I did not even know when it was released. One of my husband's coworkers, a biker himself who liked the movie, gave us the DVD which we watched on Saturday night and had a good time. No, it is not a subtle, witty and sophisticated comedy but so what?

1075619,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000QFCD7W,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[3, 6]","WILD HOGS fluctuates between a certain insipidity and gut-busting humor. The film suffers from contrived situations and phoned-in efforts of two of the leads (a too twitchy John Travolta, who overacts, and Tim Allen, who's been letting me down a lot lately). Meanwhile, Martin Lawrence is his normal hit and miss comedic self. William H. Macy is the fourth lead and carries WILD HOGS on his reliable shoulders, here providing a hefty bulk of the film's hilarious scenes. I don't think I exaggerate when I state that Mr. Macy can do no wrong as an actor. He embellishes his portrayal of a nebbish, klutzy computer geek with a layer of sensitivity and naive soulfulness. He's very endearing in his haplessness. To me, the most honest moments in the film come in Macy's tongue-tied but heartfelt romancing of the lovely Marisa Tomei, who, by the way, is the second most appealing performer here.SERIOUS SPOILERS begin:WILD HOGS is a rallying road picture for the downtrodden middle-aged menfolk, a CITY SLICKERS for the new millennium (but not as consistently charming or funny). When Woody, an in-trouble businessman (Travolta) decides to forget his troubles, he manages to talk his longtime buddies into taking a stab at the wild freedom as exercised by bike gangs who live free off the land. Woody intends for his bike-riding Wild Hogs pals to do this by taking a cross-country trip on their Harleys and fending for themselves on the road and without their cell phones. The three other 40-something members of this part-time bike ""gang"" consist of Doug (Allen), a dentist with dietary prohibitions whose family treats him with fond and absentminded scorn, Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a plumber and the very portrait of emasculation (he's so henpecked he lies to his wife and tells her he's going to a toilet bowl seminar), and Dudley (William H. Macy), a clueless but very affable computer expert who insists on having motorcycle mishaps.But an early sampling of life on the wild side only offers up inclement weather, a marshmallow-induced conflagration, poop in a bag, and birds in the face. Then, a misconstrued conversation and the vision of men sharing the same sleeping bag threaten to land the four in hot water with a seemingly disapproving patrolman (a tightly uniformed John C. McGinley). Later on, these four in deep water threaten to land them in a sleeping bag with the same patrolman. Know what I mean?Soon after, a poorly conceived excursion into a real biker bar gets the guys in trouble as they run afoul of a local bike gang, the Del Fuegos, the leader of which (Ray Liotta, who, surprise, has another intimidatingly intense role) goes on a rant about bike-riding poseurs and then exacts punishment from the Hogs. However, Woody refuses to slink back to his white collar world and opts to do something retaliatory. The film then, more or less, takes a break from its travelogue tone as it hones in on the Wild Hogs frenziedly coping with the consequences of Woody's actions.END SPOILERS.Detractors of the film will find much to back up their claims: the lackluster performances (Travolta as a lead is wasted), a certain lack of chemistry among the leads, and the uninspired storyline. To me, however, this is simply a case of the truly funny moments actually outweighing the negatives and swinging my vote towards a favorable response. I'll be honest: yes, I noticed the flaws, but I was having so much fun in the theater I was able to magnanimously overlook them. Granted, some of the humor is forced and some just doesn't work (c'mon, what person above 7 years old really finds munching on a butter stick funny?). And, granted, I expected more from the all-star cast as the only ones who I felt earned their paychecks were Macy, Tomei, and Liotta - oh, and I also enjoyed the droll musical bits with Tenacious D's Kyle Gass. Travolta needs to pay better attention to future scripts (that, or brush up on his acting) or he just might take a tumble down to the same tier of acting purgatory in which Allen and Lawrence inhabit.WILD HOGS is inundated with poop jokes, gay jokes, bull slapping, gags involving items hitting people's personal areas...you know, low brow stuff. Now, that could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preference and juvenile mindset. However, the dubiousness of certain aspects of the comedy is thankfully offset by several genuinely laugh-out-loud sequences, two of my favorites being the early scene of Macy on his computer while in a coffee shop and the chuckle-icious closing credit sequence. You probably know going in that this film won't stretch your intellect, no. But there's a chance it might elicit hearty chuckles out of your gut. In my opinion, it's worth watching the film if only to savor William H. Macy's engaging take on Dudley and the sweet comeliness of Marisa Tomei. Liotta, too, has his moments.One legendary biker advises the Hogs to either ""ride hard or go home."" WILD HOGS, despite the cinematic pot holes, rides hard enough.

1075629,APZC5PRJVM0PY,B000QFCD7W,JD,"[4, 6]","I really wanted to like this movie.  I liked the premise and the casting choices but beyond that I felt the movie really didn't deliver anything, especially in the humor department.The movie has four middle-aged men that need a break from their lives and use a motorcycle road trip to try and bring out their wild sides (which they don't have).  Travolta is the leader of the foursome with Lawrence, Allen and Macey as his friends.  Why are these guys that are so different friends? Well, I don't know that they are even friends as there isn't much in the way of charisma between them (except on the part of Macey who seems to genuinely accept and care about the group).  To illustrate this, there is a time when Travolta tells the gang that his reason for putting together the road trip is because his life was falling apart and he is losing everything.  Don't expect any sympathy from his ""friends"" though.For a comedy this movie delivers very little in the laugh department.  There is some slapstick comedy (falling off of bikes) that will make you chuckle but by the end Dudley's clumsiness is tiring.  Other than that, the movie recycles jokes and cliches and tries to make you think they are funny (how many gay jokes are in this movie anyway???).  Even things that would be funny (such as Dudley losing control of his computer while trying to impress a lady in a restaurant) are so unbelievable that they are hard to enjoy (he's a computer programmer but he can't turn off his own computer?).  It feels like the writers didn't try very hard and expected the star power to carry this movie.  That may have worked if the movie wasn't so heavy in the casting department that the individual characters can never fully get into their groove.In the end there is a moment of togetherness from the four when they think they are standing up for each other and what is right, but really since they burned down the bar of Ray Liotta they can hardly be surprised that his gang wants to burn down the diner they are trying to protect.  It is the typical feel-good ending that most comedies fall back on, but it doesn't deliver much and it is just as shallow as the rest of the movie.Ultimately I was left thinking that if the movie didn't feel so recycled and juvenile that it could have worked.

The actors seemed to have a really good time doing this movie, too. The story is about a group of middle-aged weekend bikers from the 'burbs who feel the itch for adventure. Impulsively, they decide to go on a road trip on their bikes with no plan. Hilarity ensues when each bumbling character faces a challenge that addresses each of their fears, especially when they meet a rough biker gang in New Mexico headed by ultimate biker (Ray Liotta).The movie is lengthy but you will allow it if you are just in the mood for laughs. The laughs come especially if you are able to relate to the characters' situations. Tim Allen plays Doug Madsen, reportedly a daredevil in his teens but grows up to become a dentist who has played it safe ever since he got married with kids. John Travolta plays Woody Stevens, the supposedly successful guy who has it all, but is actually hiding a divorce from his supermodel wife and his bankrupt status. Martin Lawrence plays Bobby Davis, the henpecked husband who doesn't bring home the bacon. The best performance for me was from William H. Macy as Dudley Frank, the quintessential geek.It was nice to see Macy play this character because he really pulled it off and it was such a welcome change from his honest cop roles. A little dance sequence was once more milked out of Travolta, who also played his role quite well (his face looked like he gets Botoxed regularly!). Marisa Tomei was a nice surprise. She plays Maggy, the owner of the small town diner. Like her character, she has definitely aged and seems to have been forgotten in such a tiny town but she is still quite pretty and has that fragile, approachable appeal.

Apparently, we ask ourselves this question more often than not. Wild Hogs is just another example of celebrity get-together comedy where the good jokes are few and far between. It is a missed opportunity to create something unique from a good concept--look at the cast for crying out loud--but fails to deliver due to the bad script and lame jokes. These hogs are not wild at all.Story:The film is about four wannabe bikers and family men who call themselves Wild Hogs. The crew members are Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy). These inoffensive middle-age guys are tired of their personal lives and decide--with Travolta on the lead--to take a road trip across the country with nothing but their motorcycles. Riding their bikes is a good way to bring back the good old days they miss so much. California is their final destination, but they are going to be facing a gang of ""true"" angry bikers led by Jack (Ray Liotta) along the way.Review:In Wild Hogs, we see five has-been actors who apparently are here for an easy paycheck. In a way, they play characters that resemble some of their previous movies. Ray Liotta is a good example, when we see him laughing hysterically a la GoodFellas. They try so hard to bring their old glorious days back by acting wild and carefree and it doesn't work because they are not that funny and their dialogue feels forced as well as the jokes. How many times do we have to see a man falling off a bike? Then, we see the beautiful Marisa Tomei who has virtually no dialogue in the film. What a waste of talent.Was The Village People in charge of the script? The gay jokes and innuendos are way too many to count in this film--especially for a PG 13 movie. We got few chuckles, nothing more. Probably the writes thought that this type of jokes will stick, but they are rather uncomfortable.From has-been actors, we also get has-been music. We hear rock songs left and right from like 20-something years ago. They are good songs, but unoriginal and it all gets very repetitive after a while. How many times do you want to listen to Highway to Hell by AC/DC or Dead or Alive by Bon Jovi?The Verdict:Wild Hogs is nothing more than a celebrity get-together to bring back their glorious past--it is so painfully obvious.

1075645,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,B000QFCD7W,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[3, 8]","Here is a movie that I figured I knew how it would turn out from the get-go. The premise was that of four buddies who love to go riding their motorcycles together on weekends calling themselves Wild Hogs, and throughout the rest of the week lead rather dull, boring lives. So, with that premise being obvious from the trailers I thought the movie looked alright, it appeared to have plenty of humor from its rather talented ensemble cast comprised of Tim Allen (""The Santa Clause""), John Travolta (""Ladder 49""), Martin Lawrence (""Big Momma's House""), and William H. Macy (""Cellular""), but I wondered if all the funny parts were in the preview, a problem that many comedies seem to fall prey to. However, upon its release movie audiences were praising it as being one of the funniest films of the year, and a must see movie. This of course made me curious, so one night my wife and I decided to go see a movie and ""Wild Hogs"" turned out to be the one we wound up going to see. And let me tell you we were absolutely rolling with laughter, as was the rest of the audience.""Wild Hogs"" is the story of four friends, as I stated earlier, who are all having some form of mid-life crisis, and they decide to take a road trip on their motorcycles across the country. With no plan, no map, and no cell phones, just them and the road, these four guys are in for the ride of their lives. However, their trip doesn't always go as smoothly as they'd hope, after having some rather embarrasing mishaps that they'd love nothing more than to forget about, these four friends decide to stop off at a bar for a drink. Except this isn't any ordinary bar, it's a biker bar belonging to a dangerous biker gang known as the Del Fuegos, who don't take too kindly to wannabe bikers in their territory. So will these 'Hogs' survive their road trip adventure or find that sometimes it doesn't pay to be wild.This is one movie that definitely surprised me by how good it really was. What surprised me the most was the fact that for being an ensemble comedy it was absolutely hilarious throughout the entire duration, and each of the lead actors had their fair share of the laughs to give. To me, the most surprising of the entire cast was William H. Macy. I've always thought he was a good actor, but never thought of him as much of a funnyman, but all that changed with this movie. He was by far the absolute funniest of the 4 main actors. Don't get me wrong Tim Allen gives his most hilarious performance since his run on ""Home Improvement"", John Travolta's never been this funny, and Martin Lawrence hasn't been this on his game since the first ""Big Momma's House"". But it's William H. Macy's performance that is most memorable. Ray Liotta as the lead biker was a good choice for the villain, and it was obvious he was having fun playing the role opposite such comedic talent and he even had a couple of humorous moments to shine in.The story was actually much better than I predicted it to be, with plenty of surprise cameos, and humorous setups and one-liners, it was nice to see a comedy that didn't rely purely on sight-gags and slapstick. Director Walt Becker is no stranger to comedy after helming the hilarious ""Van Wilder"", but this was definitely a different type of comedy for him. ""Van Wilder"" was a very adult-oriented, raunchy comedy as most National Lampoon movies are, but ""Wild Hogs"" is a fairly family friendly film that doesn't fall back on the run-of-the-mill sex jokes or fart gags; instead, this film survives on the terrific comedic timing of its talented cast and well-paced script. ""Wild Hogs"" is one extremely funny ride of a movie that the whole family should enjoy, especially those with a penchant for motorcycles and road trips.""Wild Hogs"" is rated PG-13 for language and mild violence.",5,These Hogs Were Born To Be Wild...,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,3791,"['Here', 'movie', 'figured', 'knew', 'how', 'would', 'turn', 'out', 'get-go', 'premise', 'was', 'four', 'buddies', 'who', 'love', 'go', 'riding', 'motorcycles', 'together', 'weekends', 'calling', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'rest', 'week', 'lead', 'rather', 'dull', 'boring', 'lives', 'So', 'premise', 'being', 'obvious', 'trailers', 'thought', 'movie', 'looked', 'alright', 'appeared', 'have', 'plenty', 'humor', 'rather', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'comprised', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Santa', 'Clause', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Ladder', '49', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'Cellular', 'wondered', 'funny', 'parts', 'were', 'preview', 'problem', 'many', 'comedies', 'seem', 'fall', 'prey', 'However', 'release', 'movie', 'audiences', 'were', 'praising', 'being', 'one', 'funniest', 'films', 'year', 'must', 'see', 'movie', 'course', 'made', 'curious', 'so', 'one', 'night', 'wife', 'decided', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'one', 'wound', 'up', 'going', 'see', 'let', 'tell', 'were', 'absolutely', 'rolling', 'laughter', 'was', 'rest', 'audience', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'story', 'four', 'friends', 'stated', 'earlier', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'form', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'decide', 'take', 'road', 'trip', 'motorcycles', 'country', 'plan', 'map', 'cell', 'phones', 'just', 'road', 'four', 'guys', 'are', 'ride', 'lives', 'However', 'trip', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'as', 'smoothly', ""'d"", 'hope', 'having', 'rather', 'embarrasing', 'mishaps', ""'d"", 'love', 'nothing', 'more', 'forget', 'four', 'friends', 'decide', 'stop', 'off', 'bar', 'drink', ""n't"", 'ordinary', 'bar', 'biker', 'bar', 'belonging', 'dangerous', 'biker', 'gang', 'known', 'Del', 'Fuegos', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'kindly', 'wannabe', 'bikers', 'territory', 'So', 'will', ""'Hogs"", 'survive', 'road', 'trip', 'adventure', 'find', ""n't"", 'pay', 'be', 'wild.This', 'one', 'movie', 'definitely', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'really', 'was', 'What', 'surprised', 'most', 'was', 'fact', 'being', 'ensemble', 'comedy', 'was', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'entire', 'duration', 'lead', 'actors', 'had', 'fair', 'share', 'laughs', 'give', 'most', 'surprising', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'good', 'actor', 'never', 'thought', 'much', 'funnyman', 'changed', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'absolute', 'funniest', '4', 'main', 'actors', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'most', 'hilarious', 'performance', 'run', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'John', 'Travolta', 'never', 'been', 'funny', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', ""n't"", 'been', 'game', 'first', 'Big', 'Momma', 'House', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'performance', 'most', 'memorable', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'lead', 'biker', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'villain', 'was', 'obvious', 'was', 'having', 'fun', 'playing', 'role', 'opposite', 'such', 'comedic', 'talent', 'even', 'had', 'couple', 'humorous', 'moments', 'shine', 'in.The', 'story', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'predicted', 'be', 'plenty', 'surprise', 'cameos', 'humorous', 'setups', 'one-liners', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'purely', 'sight-gags', 'slapstick', 'Director', 'Walt', 'Becker', 'stranger', 'comedy', 'helming', 'hilarious', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'was', 'definitely', 'different', 'type', 'comedy', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'was', 'very', 'adult-oriented', 'raunchy', 'comedy', 'most', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'movies', 'are', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'fairly', 'family', 'friendly', 'film', ""n't"", 'fall', 'back', 'run-of-the-mill', 'sex', 'jokes', 'fart', 'gags', 'instead', 'film', 'terrific', 'comedic', 'timing', 'talented', 'cast', 'well-paced', 'script', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'one', 'extremely', 'funny', 'ride', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'should', 'enjoy', 'especially', 'penchant', 'motorcycles', 'road', 'trips', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'language', 'mild', 'violence']",N/A

Fantasy worlds, science fiction worlds, and animated worlds.  One of the worlds that Hollywood visits on almost a bi-weekly basis that I could live without is the worlds of pure delusion.  This is the world where the characters of ""Wild Hogs"" live in, a world where there are eccentric characters to be found, places to go, and no cares in the world.  The movie revolves around four men named Woody (John Travolta), Doug (Tim Allen), Bobby (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley (William H. Macy), who grew up in college and are now facing a mid-life crisis.  Doug imagined his life would be more grand and adventurous when he grew up, but now he works as a dentists (though he occasionally calls himself doctor).  Bobby is a struggling writer who works for a pluming company, and finds himself only second in command to his overbearing wife.Dudley is a computer wiz who can't talk to girls, a fear that has followed him for what appears to be fifty years.  Woody seems to be the most successful of the four, having married a supermodel and is extremely wealthy.  Alas, he's too ashamed to tell everyone that his supermodel wife left him three months ago, and he's now so broke he can't even afford to pay a local kid more then ten dollars to rake his lawn.  All four men are clearly not happy with their lives, but they do enjoy getting our their Harley Davidsons out once a week, putting on their Wild Hogs jackets, and pretending to be bikers.  Then Woody pitches an idea: Why don't they take an unplanned road trip to California.  The idea involves no planning, no map, and to just drop whatever it is your doing and going along for the ride.  This is where the world of delusion comes into play in the screenplay.All these men feel this is a great idea.  And why shouldn't they, because despite being married, having families, and (for the most part) steady jobs, these men are clearly miserable.  Maybe a road trip will cheer them up.  This I can accept.  What I don't accept is the wives of the men (that are still married anyway) simply accepting this idea.  Doug's wife?  She thinks this road trip would be great, and his son is so busy hanging out with his friends ""cool dad"" that he'll never miss his ""uncool real dad.""  Dudley isn't married, so he's game.  Woody has nowhere to go, so this is a grand adventure.  Since Bobby responds to his wife and not the other way around, he tells her that he is going to a pluming conference.  For the convenience of making sure the characters have no convenience, the screenplay has them destroy all their cell phones before they leave on the trip.  You know, to make the journey more ""adventurous.""  All this takes place in about ten minutes, so we can get what we paid for.Gay jokes.  Fire jokes.  Poop jokes.  Black jokes.  And stupid jokes.  Dear God are there stupid jokes all throughout this movie.  Movies like this are not built on solid character or story foundations, they are built on stupid jokes.  This movie lives by the rule where every misunderstanding that can happen does happen.  I mean, how many times do we have to see the scene where all the men through completely unrealistic circumstances be forced to share one bed, and then have an outsider discover them and makes homosexual references.  It's too easy (though I would also like to add that it's also not funny).  Tim Allen continues to show that no matter how likable a guy he is, he REALLY needs to pick better scripts!  By now he's WAY to old to be playing the family man, and maybe he really should do some independent film that could garner him an Oscar nomination or something.William H. Macy looks completely wrong for this role, looking a good twenty years older then all the other actors he's working with.  If he's a buddy friend of theirs, I hate to think if it was simply because he got held back in school for one year too many.  John Travolta seems to be having the most fun with this movie, but at his age he doesn't want to make too many movies like this, because another career reviver like ""Pulp Fiction"" is a once in a lifetime thing to come along.  The only actor who appears to be at home here is Martin Lawrence, who has a made a career out of making stupid comedies, and therefor we have no expectations of him.  All in all though, I think this movie was a total waste.  During interviews of this movie all the cast members talk about how much fun they all had making this movie.The strange thing about this is the interviews from the cast of ""Ocean's 11"" were almost identical to these ones.  The difference was with ""Ocean's 11"" you could feel in the movie that the cast was having fun, and a result they ended up making a fun movie, which is far more then I can say for ""Wild Hogs.""Rating: * star",1,It's Official: Tim Allen's Career Is Dead,1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,4791,"['Movies', 'take', 'up', 'many', 'different', 'kinds', 'worlds', 'Fantasy', 'worlds', 'science',

Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist on a diet.  Bobby (Martin Lawrence) is a writer/plumber who is whipped by every female in his family.  Woody (John Travolta), once wealthy, now finds himself broke and dumped.  And Dudley (William H. Macy) is a painfully nerdy computer programmer who is smart enough to install voice-recognition software in his laptop, but not smart enough to figure out how to turn his computer off when it starts to belt out embarrasing website names in the middle of a coffee shop.How on Earth did these four men ever become friends?  Who cares?  Certainly not the script.  It's too busy hauling out old sitcom cliches and cheesy character foibles to ever consider things like back stories or, say, plausibility.The men eventually meet a ""real"" gang of bikers, the Del Fuegos, led by Jack (Ray Liotta, in the only decent role of the film), and of course they go head-to-head.  Caught in the middle is the small, arid town of Madrid, where the sherrifs get their training by playingDoom 3and the waitresses look like Marisa Tomei.Wait a minute.  That IS Marisa Tomei.  And guess which of our hapless heroes she falls in love with for no apparant reason whatsoever?  The answer is less interesting than you might think.And so is the film.  It has its moments (Macy's bumbling dope gets a few good lines, and Lawrence manages to be funny without saying much at all), but those moments are fleeting.  The rest of the film is paint-by-numbers comedy, a bad mixture ofBoy Meets WorldandEasy Rider.  If you like guys on bikes accidentally clotheslining themselves on street signs, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the jokes this flick has to offer.

1075677,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000QFCD7W,Mike Zimmerman,"[2, 6]","Woody Stevens (John Travolta) is a successful businessman who just broke up with his supermodel wife; Doug Madsen (Tim Allen) is a milquetoast dentist who is fed up with his job; Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence) is a punching bag to his family; Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) is a shy computer programmer who is the opposite of a ladies man. Together, they decide to go out on a road trip and forget about their problems. But little did they know they were just beginning - they attract a menacing biker gang (led by Ray Liotta) and a homosexual cop (John C. McGinley), and Dudley may have found the one (Marisa Tomei).Take note: Wild Hogs may not be for everyone. Directed by Walt Becker (""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"", which introduced the world to Ryan Reynolds), the film stars three actors who had once respectable track records, then decided to coast on paychecks (Travolta began a downward spiral after ""Battlefield Earth"", Allen starred in three movies last year that all got nominated for Razzies, and Martin Lawrence never made a movie that critics praised him for). Place them with some award-winning actors who have dignity if they have their hearts in a project (Macy, Liotta, Tomei). And the plot is lifted from ""City Slickers"", but with crotch rockets. A recipe like that could spell disaster. So why did I have such a good time?Set free from the college background of his recent film, and armed with a PG-13 rating, Becker inflates the film with air to breathe and let whatever is in the film keep the audience in good terms. The gay jokes aren't as bad as people claim they are - Scrubs funnyman McGinley gets a few good laughs as the ambiguously gay patrol officer who becomes smitten with the bikers. The boys get into some trouble when they have to partake in a bullslapping event (the name speaks for itselves) - it's nowhere near Jackass Number Two's wackiness, but seeing Tim Allen gets hit in the butt by bullhorns gets my approval. The middle-aged men try to blend in with the bikers but they just bury themselves deep. Admist the comedy cliches (crotch wallops, Allen and Lawrence's sloppy line readings, bugs and crows hitting our heroes, and accidental porn usage), something around here will make you laugh.Becker does pull out some good performances from bad comic actors Allen and Lawrence. While the former is once again relying on tired comic scenarios that got him slapped by critics of last year (he gets crap in his eyes during the aforementioned bike sequence), it's wise that he took the PG-13 route that he didn't do since ""Big Trouble"". Set free from the clutches of Disney, Allen's comic chops are slowly developing back again, especially cause he's working with people his age instead of playing the tired sad sack father role that got him shat on.Lawrence is another worthy of mention. While he's still playing the obnoxious main character that is poison to critics, like in ""Open Season"", it's a bit toned down so he can play a more sympathetic character who doesn't ad-lib much. Though this poisonous act is used more efficiently when he makes a fool out of some of the Del Fuegos at the fair. It's the only time he does this stuff, but Lawrence allowed me to have some fun.The character actors get the bulk of the laughs. John Travolta grabs hold of his role as the Hog who has alot to lose, and embraces it well. Seeing him react to the danger that lurks around him and blubber is priceless. But those are who familiar with William H. Macy's work - which is mostly dramas - will become shocked when they see him work his magic in a slapstick comedy. Macy is as loose as Travolta, playing a geek who is eager to bust out of his shell, and delivers probably one of his coolest performances.The other performances - Liotta is energetic and menacing as Jack, Tomei (as Dudley's love interest) isn't as memorable as she used to be, and there's a surprise appearance from an ""Easy Rider"" that will have people talking.Why did I give this film three stars? As I mentioned before - Becker doesn't have very good subtlety (some sequences have long gaps of unfunny comedy, AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell"" isn't exploited to full potential, and the fight at the end is drawn out with characters getting punched more than they deserve). But with additional writing from Brad Copeland (""My Name is Earl""), something in Wild Hogs works like magic. Any movie featuring Tenacious D member Kyle Gass singing a Pussycat Dolls song is pretty much worth a good matinee ticket.",3,"""I'm the first to get buckwild""",1172966400,"03 4, 2007",2007,4496,"['Woody', 'Stevens', 'John', 'Travolta', 'successful', 'businessman', 'who', 'just', 'broke', 'up', 'supermodel', 'wife', 'Doug', 'Madsen', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'milquetoast', 'dentist', 'who', 'fed', 'up', 'job', 'Bobby', 'Davis', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'punching', 'bag', 'family', 'Dudley', 'Frank', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'shy', 'computer', 'programmer', 'who', 'opposite', 'ladies', 'man', 'Together', 'decide', 'go', 'out', 'road', 'trip', 'forget', 'problems', 'little', 'did', 'know', 'were', 'just', 'beginning', 'attract', 'menacing', 'biker', 'gang', 'led', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'homosexual', 'cop', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Dudley', 'may', 'have', 'found', 'one', 'Marisa', 'Tomei', '.Take', 'note', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'Directed', 'Walt', 'Becker', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Van', 'Wilder', 'introduced', 'world', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'film', 'stars', 'three', 'actors', 'who', 'had', 'once', 'respectable', 'track', 'records', 'then', 'decided', 'coast', 'paychecks', 'Travolta', 'began', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'Allen', 'starred', 'three', 'movies', 'last', 'year', 'got', 'nominated', 'Razzies', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'never', 'made', 'movie', 'critics', 'praised', 'Place', 'award-winning', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'dignity', 'have', 'hearts', 'project', 'Macy', 'Liotta', 'Tomei', 'plot', 'lifted', 'City', 'Slickers', 'crotch', 'rockets', 'recipe', 'could', 'spell', 'disaster', 'why', 'did', 'have', 'such', 'good', 'time', 'Set', 'free', 'college', 'background', 'recent', 'film', 'armed', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'Becker', 'film', 'air', 'breathe', 'let', 'film', 'keep', 'audience', 'good', 'terms', 'gay', 'jokes', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'claim', 'are', 'Scrubs', 'funnyman', 'McGinley', 'few', 'good', 'laughs', 'ambiguously', 'gay', 'patrol', 'officer', 'who', 'smitten', 'bikers', 'boys', 'get', 'trouble', 'when', 'have', 'partake', 'bullslapping', 'event', 'name', 'itselves', 'nowhere', 'near', 'Jackass', 'Number', 'Two', 'wackiness', 'seeing', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'hit', 'butt', 'bullhorns', 'approval', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'try', 'blend', 'bikers', 'just', 'bury', 'deep', 'Admist', 'comedy', 'cliches', 'crotch', 'wallops', 'Allen', 'Lawrence', 'sloppy', 'line', 'readings', 'bugs', 'crows', 'hitting', 'heroes', 'accidental', 'porn', 'usage', 'something', 'around', 'here', 'will', 'make', 'laugh.Becker', 'pull', 'out', 'good', 'performances', 'bad', 'comic', 'actors', 'Allen', 'Lawrence', 'former', 'once', 'again', 'relying', 'tired', 'comic', 'scenarios', 'got', 'slapped', 'critics', 'last', 'year', 'crap', 'eyes', 'aforementioned', 'bike', 'sequence', 'wise', 'took', 'PG-13', 'route', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Set', 'free', 'clutches', 'Disney', 'Allen', 'comic', 'chops', 'are', 'slowly', 'developing', 'back', 'again', 'especially', 'cause', 'working', 'people', 'age', 'instead', 'playing', 'tired', 'sad', 'sack', 'father', 'role', 'got', 'shat', 'on.Lawrence', 'worthy', 'mention', 'still', 'playing', 'obnoxious', 'main', 'character', 'poison', 'critics', 'Open', 'Season', 'bit', 'toned', 'down', 'so', 'can', 'play', 'more', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'who', ""n't"", 'ad-lib', 'much', 'poisonous', 'act', 'used', 'more', 'efficiently', 'when', 'fool', 'Del', 'Fuegos', 'fair', 'only', 'time', 'stuff', 'Lawrence', 'allowed', 'have', 'fun.The', 'character', 'actors', 'get', 'bulk', 'laughs', 'John', 'Travolta', 'grabs', 'hold', 'role', 'Hog', 'who', 'alot', 'lose', 'well', 'Seeing', 'react', 'danger', 'blubber', 'priceless', 'are', 'who', 'familiar', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'work', 'mostly', 'dramas', 'will', 'become', 'shocked', 'when', 'see', 'work', 'magic', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'Macy', 'as', 'loose', 'Travolta', 'playing', 'geek', 'who', 'eager', 'bust', 'shell', 'delivers', 'probably', 'one', 'coolest', 'performances.The', 'other', 'performances', 'Liotta', 'energetic', 'menacing', 'Jack', 'Tomei', 'Dudley', 'love', 'interest', ""n't"", 'as', 'memorable', 'used', 'be', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'will', 'have', 'people', 'talking.Why', 'did', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'mentioned', 'Becker', ""n't"", 'have', 'very', 'good', 'subtlety', 'sequences', 'have', 'long', 'gaps', 'unfunny', 'comedy', 'AC/DC', 'Highway', 'Hell', ""n't"", 'exploited', 'full', 'potential', 'fight', 'end', 'drawn', 'out', 'characters', 'getting', 'punched', 'more', 'deserve', 'additional', 'writing', 'Brad', 'Copeland', 'Name', 'Earl', 'something', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'magic', 'movie', 'featuring', 'Tenacious', 'D', 'member', 'Kyle', 'Gass', 'singing', 'Pussycat', 'Dolls', 'song', 'pretty', 'much', 'good', 'matinee', 'ticket']",N/A

They each have nothing to liven up their quickly aging lives except the annual suburb's parade in which they ride their Harleys in formation. Exciting stuff. One of them comes up with the brain wave to take a road trip. A long story short, they all agree to go, and four of them set out for the Pacific U.S. in an adventure that has no plans, and no cellphones.The format was pretty predictable: the four would do something, and something would go wrong. The trick was guessing what went wrong with each new event. The humour is fairly slapstick in nature, though there is a deeper side to it. I have to admit, the deeper side comes in pretty shallow, in all honesty.This is no deep movie, though the critique of mid-life surburban boredom could be a target of the movie's comment.

Liotta, who is upset that the Hogs' are not ""real"" bikers but pampered Suburbanites who are disrespecting his crew and other bikers by what he feels is them perpetrating. From that point all heck breaks loose.

During the week each does his nine-to-five thing, but every weekend they armor up in denim and leather, cruise around town on their motorcycles and then have a few beers. When mid-life crisis tickled one man's nose, it was not long before it spread through the group and a motorcycle road trip ensued. What better way for them to regain the spontanaety and autonomy of their glory days? I'm not sure this plot really needed conflict, but on their way west they came across a more traditional biker gang, who did not take kindly to these four midwestern suburbanites considering themselves peers.When the movie was first advertised I could not believe the cast (John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy). I had no issues with getting such an ensemble together, I was more taken back by the fact that these men (primarily Travolta) would make a movie like this. The more I thought about it, and certainly now that I have seen the movie, I believe that this was more about making a fun movie and working together than it was about setting box office records. I would have loved to be a fly on the camera while these men worked together; I hope it was as much fun for them as I imagine it to have been.I gave Wild Hogs ""the old college try"" since I had heard some surprisingly encouraging remarks. I talked to a few people who were very pleased with the movie. I addressed my concerns with them about how cheesy it looked and I was told not to worry. In the end, Wild Hogs was very cheesy. But it was fun enough for what it was. If you can relate with the characters I am sure there is more substance to the movie than I was able to enjoy.Have you ever been told that, ""You will love Office Space even more if you have ever worked in an office setting?""

1075697,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B000QFCD7W,"Promise ""promise""","[8, 12]","When this movie first appeared, I read the review by N.O.Scott, in the New York Times.  He blasted it (in a very funny way.)  Then a friend of mine seconded his opinion, claiming it was dreadful.  She mentioned that the 12 yr old boy she brought to the film thoroughly enjoyed it.  One of the readers of the NYTimes, a jr. high teacher, said he found the movie to be perfectly geared to a jr. high audience.So....I waited till it came to the dollar theater, not expecting a whole lot.  I think that expectations are important...I have found that if I expect a lot I'm often disappointed, and vice-versa.  So I offer this review saying that if you don't expect High Art, and are not bothered by politically incorrect homophobic jokes, you might like this.  (I also advise you to read the review here by Mark Eremite, which I think is quite intelligent.)So, expecting not-much, I bought my very cheap ticket and joined the crowd at the Sat. afternoon show at the cheapest theater in town.  I actually enjoyed it!  Not a huge amount---but my attention never left the screen from beginning to end.  With the exception of a really tacky episode with a gay cop, there's nothing really offensive.  And that says a lot for movies these days.I think that the success of the film (and it was a huge box office smash) is due to the very capable and attractive cast.  John Travolta is strong and charismatic.  While I wouldn't call him exactly handsome, he certainly is hunky and not bad to look at. He doesn't seem to take the role terribly seriously but maybe that's ok.  Martin Lawrence is very funny and endearing.  His facial expressions are terrific and he excudes a sweet vulnerability as the hen pecked plumber.William H. Macy, a fine actor, brings a touch of class to what could have been a very dopey character--the computer nerd.  He embues this girl-shy guy with an innocence and simplicity that is really touching.  Even with his rumpled face and tendancy to self-destruct, he wins the prettiest girl in town, which I found truly touching.Tim Allen's performance, as the dentist, was the most lack-luster, in my opinion.  He does have a nice moment near the end, when confronting the ""real"" bikers, telling them that they, are really the posers.  That won points for me.The big surprise is the cameo appeaance of the archetypal film bad-biker, Peter Fonda!

It's a story that almost anyone 40 or older who has ever dreamed of riding a motorcycle can relate to.  The central characters are four middle aged guys, Doug (Tim Allen), a dentist who hardly knows the meaning of fun anymore, Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a henpecked plumber, Woody (John Travolta), a lawyer who, with his supermodel wife and lucrative career, seems to have it all but has secretly fallen on hard times and Dudley (William H. Macy), an extremely naive, geeky computer programmer.  The four decide, once and for all, to live a little and to take a cross country road trip on their Harleys.  Along the way, they have a series of misadventures that really get interesting when they run into the Del Fuegos gang who's leader Jack (Ray Liotta) takes an immediate disliking to this bunch of yuppies pretending to be real bikers.  The guys later find themselves in a situation where they have to truly rely on each other as men and as friends and where they have to really be open and honest with themselves and each other.The only real fault I found with Wild Hogs was the interaction with the gay cop which could have been completely left out.

While en route from Ohio to California, the group does battle with a leather-clad motorcycle gang (headed by Ray Liotta) that regularly terrorizes the small Midwestern town through which the boys are passing.Though the credits state that the screenplay was written by one Brad Copeland, we suspect that it might actually be the product of a precocious seventh-grader banging away on his personal computer while feeling his first stirrings of puberty.  That might account for why every single joke seems to have originated in a junior high school locker room.  With its nonstop gay-bashing and rituals of male-bonding, it's often hard to tell whether the movie is actually more homophobic or homoerotic in nature.

But the most popular option is for an actor to make light of his oldness in some sort of mid-life crisis flick. Sometimes it is executed successfully (see city slickers) and then there is Wild Hogs.The premise is paint by numbers; four buddies are hitting middle age and things are not working out the way they thought it would. John Travolta (Welcome Back Kotter) is in the middle of a divorce from his sugar momma. Tim Allen (Home Improvement) is too obsessed with his job. Martin Lawrence (Martin), is married to his former arch nemesis from his sitcom who want him to give up his dream of making a How To book to get back to work. And then there is William H. Macy (Pleasantville) the token klutz of the group.Once they all decide they need more adventure in their lives, they all decide to take their motorcycles all the way to the Pacific with no maps, GPS, or cell phones. But it is when the group ends up in a New Mexico biker bar does the movie goes into movie clich&eacute; overload. If you cannot write the ending of the movie when the antagonists show up, led by Ray Liotta (Field of Dreams) and Zeke from Lost, you must not have seen too many movies.The film does manage a few laughs throughout, none of which include the numerous naked dudes (seriously how is this PG-13), but it is never a good sign when the best ones are reserved for the afterthought that runs during the credits.

Something that is hard for any person--especially a middle-aged man.So,wanting a bright light to shine in his life,Woody Stevens makes a last minute decision. That last minute decision? To go on a cross country road trip with his three closest friends(Tim Allen's character of Doug Madsen,Martin Lawrence's character of Bobby Davis,and William H. Macy's character of Dudley Frank)who don't have the greatest lives at the present moment,either. There will be no rules--just fun,exploration,and adventures.However,in the middle of the trip,faulty trouble arises. Once Woody Stevens,Doug Madsen,Bobby Davis,and Dudley Frank arive at a motorcycle bar out in New Mexico(out in the middle of nowhere,I might add),it turns out that they are at a bar full of a motorcycle gang,the Del Fuegos. The leader,Jack(Ray Liotta)does not like the Wild Hogs,while he is not afraid to show it. At the same time,Woody Stevens went on a roadtrip for fun,not for trouble or rudeness.The result? Trouble that Woody Stevens,Doug Madsen,Bobby Davis,and Dudley Frank are going to have to lightly get themselves out of,and an inequitable ""test"" upon them,as well.The script for ""Wild Hogs"" successfully brings the film's plot to life. Everything appropriately leads to one thing after another. The humor in ""Wild Hogs"" is well-written and enjoyable,bringing viewers good laughs along the way that one would expect out of any comedy film. There is,at the same time,an appropriate amount of fun. Drama is successfully worked in the script for ""Wild Hogs"",while the ""edge"" that the film requires allows itself to be successfully executed,at the same time. All of this in ""Wild Hogs"" is well accompanied by the famous cast(Travolta,Allen,Lawrence,Macy,Liotta,and Marisa Tomei),as well as their performances at the same time. ""Wild Hogs"" gives John Travolta,Tim Allen,William H. Macy,Martin Lawrence,Ray Liotta,and Marisa Tomei fair and wortwhile time in the spotlight,while all six of them work together successfully and respectfully. Having dramatic actors work alongside comedic actors in one film isn't the easiest thing to do,but in ""Wild Hogs"",it successfully happens. All of this allows ""Wild Hogs"" to fully come together,and be the good and successful film that it is.If you were one of several people that saw ""Wild Hogs"" upon its release and were impressed,this DVD will leave you happy. The bonus feautures on this DVD (""Bikes,Brawls,and Burning Bars:The Making of ""Wild Hogs"""",""How To Get Your WIfe To Let You Buy a Motorcycle"",the freewheeling alternate ending for ""Wild Hogs"",deleted scenes,top-notch outtakes,and an audio commentary with the director and writer of ""Wild Hogs"",Walt Becker and Brad Copeland),are insightful. If you want to know more about the making of ""Wild Hogs"",the special feautres on this DVD will successfully do just that for you.Overall,if you like comedy,turn to ""Wild Hogs"".

1075722,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000QFCD7W,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[0, 0]","What started as a gay-joke laced Tim Allen comedy quickly turned into a disastrous problem-laden situation comedy which fell into the age old trap of seriousness. When the conflict is too colossal, the only solution is nonsense. A variegated cast and an unrealistically neat and tidy conclusion make this wannabe feel-good movie second-class salvage.Four middle-aged friends (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy) reach a midlife crisis in which they are bored with their everyday routines and threadbare family activities. Having a tradition of going to the local bar, riding motorcycles and wearing black leather adorned with a fictitious ""Wild Hogs"" gang logo, the lot decide to go on a road trip. Taking in the sights and the fresh air, they encounter a licentious policeman, a barbarous ""real"" biker gang and an abundance of adventure in the peaceful chile-loving town of Madrid, New Mexico.While most of the diverse cast manages to play it relatively inconspicuous, Martin Lawrence feels out of place. Travolta is in more and more comedies of late, probably since he's getting older and out of shape and less believable as a dramatic actor. Allen plays his typical ""Tool Man"" role, and William H. Macy goes back to his Mystery Men roots; which are withered and dying. Lawrence looks a little too young and his brand of comedy is mainly obnoxious dialogue, whereas the other three more easily fall into their roles of middle-aged, worn out men.The story essentially wishes to be a comedy, but the plotline resembles more serious fare. The film falls into a classic plot deterioration complex, in which the conflict created for the protagonists to overcome is so incredibly serious that the only solution is one of nonsensical luck or unbelievable circumstances. The mood is supposed to be carefree and silly, but the loss of all believability turns the lighthearted comedy into absurdity. The screenwriters couldn't figure out how to solve the enormous dilemma and it doesn't fool anyone. The most popular and pathetic ""easy way out"" example is the ""it was all just a bad dream"" scenario, which we've all seen before and is thankfully not employed by Wild Hogs. After such a noticeable blunder is made, the film wraps up too neatly. When every solution is presented to the audience with a cherry on top, it adds to the disbelief. Not everyone has to end up happy for a comedy to be commercially or critically successful.Another aspect that doesn't coalesce into the film smoothly is the overly intense villains, which could have been in a serious drama. Ray Liotta plays the rival biker gang's leader in such an unpleasant and sinister role that it feels contradictory to the playful design of the rest of the film. Towards the middle of the movie, viewers will probably be shrinking in fear for the hero foursome, due to the asperity of the dastardly enemies. The only imaginable conclusion for Liotta's character is that he will resort to murder in compensation for the wrongs done to him. When that isn't feasible in a film engineered like this, all other solutions only disrupt the suspension of disbelief. Including how many heavy-handed punches can be taken by the Wild Hogs without incurring any injuries.Lots of interesting cameos and bit parts are thrown into the film, which definitely helps, but not sufficiently. Legendary ""Easy Rider"" biker Peter Fonda makes an appearance, as well as Loveline guru Dr. Drew. Marisa ""still sexy"" Tomei plays the love interest and several other noticeable character actors appear throughout.Fun at times, silly at others and absolutely ridiculous most of the time, Wild Hogs is the perfect comedy for fans of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy, and probably no one else.- Mike Massie",3,Wild Hogs Movie Review,1187049600,"08 14, 2007",2007,3786,"['What', 'started', 'gay-joke', 'laced', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'comedy', 'quickly', 'turned', 'disastrous', 'problem-laden', 'situation', 'comedy', 'fell', 'age', 'old', 'trap', 'seriousness', 'When', 'conflict', 'too', 'colossal', 'only', 'solution', 'nonsense', 'variegated', 'cast', 'unrealistically', 'neat', 'tidy', 'conclusion', 'make', 'wannabe', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'second-class', 'salvage.Four', 'middle-aged', 'friends', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'reach', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'are', 'bored', 'everyday', 'routines', 'threadbare', 'family', 'activities', 'Having', 'tradition', 'going', 'local', 'bar', 'riding', 'motorcycles', 'wearing', 'black', 'leather', 'adorned', 'fictitious', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'gang', 'logo', 'lot', 'decide', 'go', 'road', 'trip', 'Taking', 'sights', 'fresh', 'air', 'encounter', 'licentious', 'policeman', 'barbarous', 'real', 'biker', 'gang', 'abundance', 'adventure', 'peaceful', 'chile-loving', 'town', 'Madrid', 'New', 'Mexico.While', 'most', 'diverse', 'cast', 'manages', 'play', 'relatively', 'inconspicuous', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'place', 'Travolta', 'more', 'more', 'comedies', 'late', 'probably', 'getting', 'older', 'shape', 'less', 'believable', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'Allen', 'typical', 'Tool', 'Man', 'role', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'back', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'roots', 'are', 'withered', 'dying', 'Lawrence', 'little', 'too', 'young', 'brand', 'comedy', 'mainly', 'obnoxious', 'dialogue', 'other', 'three', 'more', 'easily', 'fall', 'roles', 'middle-aged', 'worn', 'out', 'men.The', 'story', 'essentially', 'be', 'comedy', 'plotline', 'more', 'serious', 'fare', 'film', 'classic', 'plot', 'deterioration', 'complex', 'conflict', 'created', 'protagonists', 'overcome', 'so', 'incredibly', 'serious', 'only', 'solution', 'one', 'nonsensical', 'luck', 'unbelievable', 'circumstances', 'mood', 'supposed', 'be', 'carefree', 'silly', 'loss', 'believability', 'lighthearted', 'comedy', 'absurdity', 'screenwriters', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'solve', 'enormous', 'dilemma', ""n't"", 'fool', 'anyone', 'most', 'popular', 'pathetic', 'easy', 'way', 'example', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'dream', 'scenario', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thankfully', 'not', 'employed', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'such', 'noticeable', 'blunder', 'made', 'film', 'up', 'too', 'neatly', 'When', 'solution', 'presented', 'audience', 'cherry', 'top', 'disbelief', 'Not', 'everyone', 'end', 'up', 'happy', 'comedy', 'be', 'commercially', 'critically', 'successful.Another', 'aspect', ""n't"", 'coalesce', 'film', 'smoothly', 'overly', 'intense', 'villains', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'serious', 'drama', 'Ray', 'Liotta', 'rival', 'biker', 'gang', 'leader', 'such', 'unpleasant', 'sinister', 'role', 'contradictory', 'playful', 'design', 'rest', 'film', 'middle', 'movie', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'shrinking', 'fear', 'hero', 'foursome', 'due', 'asperity', 'dastardly', 'enemies', 'only', 'imaginable', 'conclusion', 'Liotta', 'character', 'will', 'resort', 'murder', 'compensation', 'wrongs', 'done', 'When', ""n't"", 'feasible', 'film', 'engineered', 'other', 'solutions', 'only', 'disrupt', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'Including', 'how', 'many', 'heavy-handed', 'punches', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'incurring', 'injuries.Lots', 'interesting', 'cameos', 'bit', 'parts', 'are', 'thrown', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'sufficiently', 'Legendary', 'Easy', 'Rider', 'biker', 'Peter', 'Fonda', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'Loveline', 'guru', 'Dr.', 'Drew', 'Marisa', 'still', 'sexy', 'Tomei', 'love', 'interest', 'several', 'other', 'noticeable', 'character', 'actors', 'appear', 'throughout.Fun', 'times', 'silly', 'others', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'most', 'time', 'Wild', 'Hogs', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'fans', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Martin', 'Lawrence', 'William', 'H.', 'Macy', 'probably', 'one', 'else.-', 'Mike', 'Massie']",N/A
