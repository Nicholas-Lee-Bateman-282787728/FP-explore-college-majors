Hebert,"[3, 46]","&quot;Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori&quot; -- &quot;Proper and sweet it is to die for the Fatherland.&quot;  These words from Vergil's &quot;Aeneid&quot; apply in spades to &quot;The Long Grey Line.&quot;  Beneath the film's overt message of patriotism, honour and glory lies one constant, recurring theme:  It's a good, grand and glorious thing for young men to be so filled with dreams of militaristic &quot;glory and honour&quot; that they are ready to die for &quot;The Reich.&quot;  And it's a good, grand and glorious thing as well for the loved ones they leave behind in mourning.Am I being a touch judgemental?  Darn right.  So why did I give it four stars?  First, any film with Tyrone Power, Maureen O'Hara, Ward Bond and the score of other fine actors (and an actress or two) is already worth at least three stars in my book.  Secondly, the film is so over-the-top in its melodramatic depiction of &quot;fantasy patriotism&quot; that I wonder whether its creators didn't mean to suggest the folly of militaristic utopianism through the expedient use of a near lethal overdose of hyper-pious hands-over-hearts whenever Old Glory passes by, the ultra-dramatic portrayals that &quot;my tragic loss is really my strength and glory,&quot; and the continuous flag-waving, death-worshipping and militaristic sentimentalising that saturates this film from start to finish.On the one hand, the war-sentimentalisers who have always sent and who continue to send young men to early graves for the sake of political and/or corporate interests will undoubtedly see this film in one light.  One that appears to validate their own far-from-honourable interests and agendas.  On the other, those who despise the fantasy of militaristic glory may well see a brilliant portrayal of the waste of young lives, a waste that brings the hero of the film to sanctimoniously mark the deaths of his former youthful cadets with a black ribbon in the appropriate yearbook. In either case, the message will be in the eye -- and prompted by the true nature of the heart and soul -- of the viewer.Whatever the case, I recommend that any viewer of this classic film follow up with a sobering shot of &quot;Taps.&quot;  And that in viewing that rather different presentation of military school cadets special attention be paid to the professional soldier who accuses his own honour-enraptured cadet son of being &quot;in love with death.&quot;",4,Dulce et Decorum...?,1086825600,"06 10, 2004",2004,2427,"['quot', 'Dulce', 'et', 'decorum', 'est', 'pro', 'patria', 'mori', 'quot', 'quot', 'Proper', 'sweet', 'die', 'Fatherland.', 'quot', 'words', 'Vergil', 'quot', 'Aeneid', 'quot', 'apply', 'spades', 'quot', 'Long', 'Grey', 'Line.', 'quot', 'Beneath', 'film', 'overt', 'message', 'patriotism', 'honour', 'glory', 'one', 'constant', 'recurring', 'theme', 'good', 'grand', 'glorious', 'thing', 'young', 'men', 'be', 'so', 'filled', 'dreams', 'militaristic', 'quot', 'glory', 'honour', 'quot', 'are', 'ready', 'die', 'quot', 'Reich.', 'quot', 'good', 'grand', 'glorious', 'thing', 'as', 'well', 'loved', 'ones', 'leave', 'mourning.Am', 'being', 'touch', 'judgemental', 'Darn', 'right', 'So', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'four', 'stars', 'First', 'film', 'Tyrone', 'Power', 'Maureen', ""O'Hara"", 'Ward', 'Bond', 'score', 'other', 'fine', 'actors', 'actress', 'two', 'already', 'worth', 'least', 'three', 'stars', 'book', 'Secondly', 'film', 'so', 'over-the-top', 'melodramatic', 'depiction', 'quot', 'patriotism', 'quot', 'wonder', 'creators', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'suggest', 'folly', 'militaristic', 'utopianism', 'expedient', 'use', 'near', 'lethal', 'overdose', 'hyper-pious', 'hands-over-hearts', 'whenever', 'Old', 'Glory', 'passes', 'ultra-dramatic', 'portrayals', 'quot', 'tragic', 'loss', 'really', 'strength', 'glory', 'quot', 'continuous', 'flag-waving', 'death-worshipping', 'militaristic', 'sentimentalising', 'film', 'start', 'finish.On', 'one', 'hand', 'war-sentimentalisers', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'sent', 'who', 'continue', 'send', 'young', 'men', 'early', 'graves', 'sake', 'political', 'and/or', 'corporate', 'interests', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'see', 'film', 'one', 'light', 'One', 'validate', 'own', 'far-from-honourable', 'interests', 'agendas', 'other', 'who', 'despise', 'fantasy', 'militaristic', 'glory', 'may', 'well', 'see', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'waste', 'young', 'lives', 'waste', 'hero', 'film', 'sanctimoniously', 'mark', 'deaths', 'former', 'youthful', 'cadets', 'black', 'ribbon', 'appropriate', 'yearbook', 'case', 'message', 'will', 'be', 'eye', 'prompted', 'true', 'nature', 'heart', 'soul', 'viewer.Whatever', 'case', 'recommend', 'viewer', 'classic', 'film', 'follow', 'up', 'sobering', 'shot', 'quot', 'Taps.', 'quot', 'viewing', 'rather', 'different', 'presentation', 'military', 'school', 'cadets', 'special', 'attention', 'be', 'paid', 'professional', 'soldier', 'who', 'own', 'honour-enraptured', 'cadet', 'son', 'being', 'quot', 'love', 'death.', 'quot']",N/A

The first part is almost slapstick comedy after he arrives at West Point and until he meets and marries Maurine O'Hara who is less feisty and irritating than she usually is in films. Tyrone Power did seem to lose his fresh, young handsomeness too rapidly so he looks a bit too old in the first part of the movie.  About l/3 of the way through the movie, it changes to a more sentimental, moving, emotional type of story and, to me, was a lot more enjoyable.  They did a good job aging Power and he handled it very well too.  I'm a sucker for these old Hollywood style beautifully photographed movies that actually have very little to do with what actually happened I'm sure. I loved the scenes of the hundreds of cadets marching and there were a lot of them. A very cute young Patrick Wayne - there because Ward Bond was in it I guess and he would have brought in John Wayne's kid. I found the fact that West Point furnished him such a lovely house apparently free of charge when he was never anything but a low rank sort of coach there was unbelievable but I guess it could have happened.  And, unless things were different then, he would have had to retire at 60 and he was apparently in the Army a lot longer than that.

All you would have to do is watch the last 10 minutes of this movie to understand what I'm saying.  However, you should see the entire movie - what perfection.  It has comedy, drama, and great acting on all parts.Tyrone Power (my favorite actor) gives a grade A performance.  Never will you find him as loveable, or as dignified than as Martin Maher, Jr.  I find it hard to believe that John Ford (the director) originally wanted John Wayne for this movie.  Not to nock Wayne, but Power can convey sensitivity better.  As a side note, John Wayne's son Patrick appears in the movie.Maureen O'Hara, lovely as ever, gets back to her Irish roots in this film, and it makes for a point-perfect characterisation from the Queen of Technicolor.

310315,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,630238091X,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I liked this film even if it is not as perfect as many other John Ford's films. Below, some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.Made in 1955, this film was inspired by the real life of Marty Maher, an Irish immigrant whose 50-year career at West Point took him from civilian dishwasher to NCO (master sergeant) and athletic instructor. In all, Maher worked and served for 50 years at West Point, from 1896 to 1946 - and when he joined US Army in 1898, the officer who swore him in was a certain John J. Pershing... After retiring in 1946, he still visited West Point almost daily, until age and poor health prevented it - he died in 1961, aged 84.In this film, Maher is played by Tyrone Power, who gives a great performance. Maureen O'Hara, grandiose as always, plays the role of his wife and veteran actor Donald Cris was cast as his formidable father. Amongst the second roles it is worth to notice Peter Graves, Ward Bond and Patrick Wayne (son of John Wayne). As it is usual with John Ford's films, actors were ""encouraged"" to perform to the best of their abilities - and they did.As frequently with Ford's films, this is a moving and heart warming story. It is however also a quite conservative, somehow ""gung ho"" and very patriotic film with discreet but firm Christian message - therefore, if you do not like this kind of stories (and especially if you are a little bit to the left from center), this film is probably not for you...The scenario is however a little bit weaker than in so many other Ford's films. There is very little tension or drama and everything is just a little bit... too sweet and pinky rose. Of course, there are some sad moments and even some genuine tragedies - but they are greatly toned down. Or, in a place so difficult and hard on young man there must be some real bad and ugly things which happen during 50 years - but all that kind of things was swept under the rug and is never mentioned. A great lot of military parades replace it... I am pretty confident also, that the REAL treatment reserved to ""plebes"" (first year students) was not shown in this film... I am certain that West Point is a very honorable place, where young men are being watched with severity by the instructors and the commanding officers - but hiding completely EVERYTHING evil and ugly that could ever happen there just hurts this film, rather than helping it.So bottom line, I liked this film, I will keep it in my collection and I give it five stars, but it is not as perfect as some other John Ford's movies, such as ""Stagecoach"", ""The Informer"", ""Searchers"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""They were expendable"", ""The Man who shot Liberty Valance"", etc. Still, a nice watch.

One would almost think West Point was an Irish military academy!  Tyrone Power does a great job portraying this stock Irish character at the Point.  I assume someone like this was actually there for that amount of time.  But one wonders if this was truly so.  I doubt the Point would have a swimming instructor who could not swim!What makes this movie more than anything else are all the nice shots of the grounds at the Point.  This is what gives you a feel for the film.  The USMA Acadmey Band and Hell Cats put in some nice martial music, again much of it strangely of Irish nature.  The famous ""Wearing of the Green"" is here used as a Point song with special words to honor a popular Tavern that often served the cadets near the gronds.  They have changed the words here to honor the character in the film.Many famous US generals have gone through the Point over the years.  One interesting observation once made about the instruction there is that because of the heavy emphsisas on engineering most of the Civil War graduates were often inclined to entrench and this is one reason way the war became so stagnant.  West Point often encouraged a conservetive officer class in the 19th century, although there can be little doubt that engineering skills were greatly praised in the growing US.  Many civil works projects were over-seen by Point graduates, and the old boy network in private industry endures until this day.This is a nice a film, with a sense of time and history, but like most John Ford films it lays it on thick with the sentimental stuff and the Blarney!
