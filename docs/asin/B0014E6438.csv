TGG Direct (whoever they are) has finally released all three- in 1,3,2 order with 4 episodes missing from Season 2.The stories aren't bad, watching the DVD sets I can remember some details even 20 years later. If you like a western type story you'll want this set and will likely want sets 1 & 3 as well.Go ahead and get it, no point in waiting any longer because we probably won't ever see Season 2 released with all 22 episodes included.My recommendation; get the MGM release of Season 1 because it has better packaging, better sound quality (and closed captioning if you need it, TGG didn't bother with that) and much better chapter divisions to the episodes (if TGG even bothered they didn't put in as many- they help you to find a favored episode segment easier when they're present) even though it'll cost you more. For Seasons 2 & 3 you'll have to go with TGG, you'll do all right with what you'll get, they just didn't put the effort out on ""their"" editions.",4,Not bad at all for the time...worth a look even with some episodes missing,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",2014,1076,"['MGM', 'released', 'Season', '1', '2007', 'guess', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'too', 'well', 'never', 'bothered', 'final', 'two', 'seasons', 'TGG', 'Direct', 'are', 'finally', 'released', 'three-', '1,3,2', 'order', '4', 'episodes', 'missing', 'Season', '2.The', 'stories', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'watching', 'DVD', 'sets', 'can', 'remember', 'details', 'even', '20', 'years', 'later', 'like', 'western', 'type', 'story', ""'ll"", 'want', 'set', 'will', 'likely', 'want', 'sets', '1', '3', 'well.Go', 'ahead', 'get', 'point', 'waiting', 'longer', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'Season', '2', 'released', '22', 'episodes', 'included.My', 'recommendation', 'get', 'MGM', 'release', 'Season', '1', 'better', 'packaging', 'better', 'sound', 'quality', 'closed', 'captioning', 'need', 'TGG', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'better', 'chapter', 'divisions', 'episodes', 'TGG', 'even', 'bothered', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'many-', 'help', 'find', 'favored', 'episode', 'segment', 'easier', 'when', ""'re"", 'present', 'even', ""'ll"", 'cost', 'more', 'Seasons', '2', '3', ""'ll"", 'have', 'go', 'TGG', ""'ll"", 'do', 'right', 'what', ""'ll"", 'get', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'effort', 'out', 'editions']",The Young Riders: Season 2

1146742,A3DD8KBKT24R28,B0014E6438,CLM,"[0, 0]","Please release the rest of the seasons as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!! We enjoy each of the characters so much - CODY - KID - EMMA - TEASPOON - JIMMY - BUCK - IKE - LOUISE AND SAM - BUT I'd have everyone listed first if that could be. It is a joy to watch them ride - such expert horsemen and horsewomen. Also, their emotions are front and center along with their intelligence especially displayed in the difficulties they find themselves in. Plus, they genuinely care about each other and about those who come into their lives as time goes on. WE love Louise and her determination and gentleness, Cody and his rifle and his great humor, Kid and his forward thinking, Emma and her genuineness, Teaspoon and his wisdom of his years, Jimmy and his upfront heart, Buck and his tender care of Ike, Ike and his absolute refusal to let his not being able to speak hold him back from life, and Sam and his faithfulness, Katey, and all of the other characters who play their parts so well.

Maybe it was just the time in my life but I enjoyed the mix of history (some fairly accurate, some a little off) and adventure stories in the show.Pros:Character interaction was good.History was an added plus, When my children watched them with me, we got to go look up some of the references. What they don't teach in school any more......Camera work was excellent.The location was well chosen.Music and sound effects were (mostly) appropriate and well timed.Travis Fine being able to convey so much with no words.The other actors (especially Gregg Rainwater) truly acting like they were trying to understand what the mute character of Ike was trying to convey and making it work.Cons:Some of the &#34;messages&#34; were too in-your-face, rather than an integrated part of the story.If you like shows where the characters have each other's backs, have good intentions, try to make up for their mistakes, and have the courage to help out each other and other people, this is the perfect place to lose yourself in a world where the good guys mostly win.",4,"Better than nothing, but I miss the missing episodes",1388188800,"12 28, 2013",2013,1169,"['series', 'five', 'star', 'set', 'can', 'buy', 'only', '4', 'star', 'missing', 'episodes.I', 'love', 'series', 'was', 'just', 'time', 'life', 'enjoyed', 'mix', 'history', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'little', 'off', 'adventure', 'stories', 'show.Pros', 'Character', 'interaction', 'was', 'good.History', 'was', 'added', 'plus', 'When', 'children', 'watched', 'got', 'go', 'look', 'up', 'references', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'teach', 'school', 'more', 'Camera', 'work', 'was', 'excellent.The', 'location', 'was', 'well', 'chosen.Music', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'mostly', 'appropriate', 'well', 'timed.Travis', 'Fine', 'being', 'able', 'convey', 'so', 'much', 'words.The', 'other', 'actors', 'especially', 'Gregg', 'Rainwater', 'truly', 'acting', 'were', 'trying', 'understand', 'what', 'mute', 'character', 'Ike', 'was', 'trying', 'convey', 'making', 'work.Cons', '34', 'messages', '34', 'were', 'too', 'in-your-face', 'rather', 'integrated', 'part', 'story.If', 'shows', 'where', 'characters', 'have', 'other', 'backs', 'have', 'good', 'intentions', 'try', 'make', 'up', 'mistakes', 'have', 'courage', 'help', 'out', 'other', 'other', 'people', 'perfect', 'place', 'lose', 'world', 'where', 'good', 'guys', 'mostly', 'win']",The Young Riders: Season 2

I think the entire cast was very well put together, each one showing their strengths. I'd never say that it was great acting, but it was fun and a period piece with a little humor thrown into the drama that often occurred.  I really REALLY hope that this will be released soon.

1146747,A2WE338J53Q94P,B0014E6438,"Mary P. Huber ""pkgrl""","[0, 0]","This particular set of season 2 is kind of odd. First, the packaging is an actual box, the lift the lid off the top kind of box. This just makes it a tad more complicated to get to the individual discs, but at least it's the same size as the regular DVD set boxes. Second thing is that four of the episodes aren't included, but they ARE available for free viewing on both Hulu and Netflix (as of November 2013) so why the exclusion on the DVDs?Beyond those two points, the set is good. Very few playback hitches (which seem common in just about every DVD these days) and after a few episodes, I didn't even care that it was formatted for the pre-HD TV sets. The image quality is very low, but the show was made on film in the early 90s, so I can't complain. At least we finally have (most of) season two on DVD!!
