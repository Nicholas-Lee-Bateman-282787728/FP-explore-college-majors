1421188,A33L7G4E8CID3,B004NJR4EO,"Adam Dukovich ""colts_19""","[10, 12]","I am a fan of Coogan's comedy, and I enjoyed the prior filmic interactions between him and Rob Brydon, so I went into the movie with high expectations. I'm pleased to say they were easily met. It's possible that American viewers who don't know the context of Coogan's career might not know where they're coming from (I will recommend watchingI'm Alan Partridge - Series 1no matter what), but the movie actually does a decent job of setting things up. Coogan and Brydon play what I assume are variations on their own selves, as competitive comedians as well as good friends. What makes the movie work is that the one-upsmanship comedy sequences aren't merely just excess, but it is often used as deflection, or to make a point, or to express a feeling. There's a definite tone of wistfulness, of middle-aged ennui, which makes the movie work as much more than a sum of comedy bits and impressions. It's the opposite of pointless, and well worth anyone's time. (Also, it appears as though they've edited out a lot of the more arcane British references from the source material to make it more accessible to Americans, so no need to worry about that.)",5,A masterful film about comedy and much more,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",2011,1148,"['am', 'fan', 'Coogan', 'comedy', 'enjoyed', 'prior', 'filmic', 'interactions', 'Rob', 'Brydon', 'went', 'movie', 'high', 'expectations', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'say', 'were', 'easily', 'met', 'possible', 'American', 'viewers', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'context', 'Coogan', 'career', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'where', ""'re"", 'coming', 'will', 'recommend', 'watchingI', ""'m"", 'Alan', 'Partridge', '1no', 'matter', 'what', 'movie', 'actually', 'decent', 'job', 'setting', 'things', 'up', 'Coogan', 'Brydon', 'play', 'what', 'assume', 'are', 'variations', 'own', 'selves', 'competitive', 'comedians', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'friends', 'What', 'movie', 'work', 'one-upsmanship', 'comedy', 'sequences', 'are', ""n't"", 'merely', 'just', 'excess', 'often', 'used', 'deflection', 'make', 'point', 'express', 'feeling', 'definite', 'tone', 'wistfulness', 'middle-aged', 'ennui', 'movie', 'work', 'as', 'much', 'more', 'sum', 'comedy', 'bits', 'impressions', 'opposite', 'pointless', 'well', 'anyone', 'time', 'Also', ""'ve"", 'edited', 'out', 'lot', 'more', 'arcane', 'British', 'references', 'source', 'material', 'make', 'more', 'accessible', 'Americans', 'need', 'worry']",N/A

They also quote poetry, declaim imaginary mock Shakespeare scenes and aim little barbed insults at each other. One of the subtle themes of the movie is the nature of their passive-aggressive friendship which is tinged with a kind of corrosive competitiveness.The setup is that Coogan was supposed to have made the trip with his American girlfriend, who decided they needed a break in the relationship and went off back to the States. We see her from time to time in snatched phone calls. Brydon's domestic setup seems better --he has a loving wife and small baby.The scenery in this late winter trip (the snow is just melting) is lovely and one of the running jokes, delivered deadpan like all the others, is the utterly pretentious food they eat. Scallops are on every menu and lots of the dishes come accompanied by unbelievably fanciful sauces and foams.Ultimately the movie stumbles on some important themes like the nature of friendship, ambition and loneliness.

The movie made me want to visit Britain, the North, specifically and do a tasting and poetry tour like these two.Of course the main fascination ultimately has to do with how much of it is real? Were Brydon and Coogan playing versions of themselves, exaggerating aspects of their personalities/insecurities for comic or dramatic effect? For instance, the Michael Sheen discussion.

I took advantage of it and watched it at least three times and hoped it would come out on DVD. A- ha! It did and it still makes me laugh. The extras are a great bonus and makes this film version from a television series more enjoyable. In the extras Steve does a song and dance number in the street with a crowd that is a continuation for his dream when a young man approaches him with a newspaper and asks for his autograph. Before Steve can walk away the young man mentions to him that he's heard that Steve is a bit of a c___. He shows Steve the headline of a newspaper he's holding that states in huge letters ""Coogan Is A C___"". Steve responds with ""whoever wrote that doesn't know me very well."" The young man responds by telling him it was Steve's Dad and shows him the rest of the headline that states ""Says Dad."" The guy walks off laughing repeating the entire headline as we see a puzzled and hurt look on Steve's face as he wakes from his dream. Steve's song and dance number is all about him confessing that headline and singing we are all a bit of a C sometimes. Only Steve Coogan can pull that off and make it funny. When his assistant Emma thinks he looks like Richard Hammond (the hamster) ""Top Gear"" after Steve asks her how he looks in an outfit to meet a pretty photographer, he is rightly insulted. I had to rewind it the first time I saw it. Brilliant laugh! If you don't know who Richard the hamster is--look him up. First time seeing Rob Brydon in action and I hope to see more of him. He shined in this with humor, intelligence and charm. Trying to do a film that involves a meal is difficult for the actors, director and crew.

The restaurants they visit, housed at posh boutique hotels, were chosen by Steve's girlfriend, Mischa, who was supposed to go with him. But Mischa has moved to the States and Rob is the only person available at such short notice.

It is also too sophisticated for the two Englishmen whose faces only lit up in total surrender when the last day, their job completed, they share a greasy English breakfast of eggs and sausages.On the previous evenings, they seemed more interested in competing with each other on who does the best imitation of Michael Caine, Liam Neeson or Sean Connery that in the modern concoctions the maitre d' brings to them.Their friendship, they deny, holds the film together.

CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 3]","The Trip is a lot like Sideways in that it features two men on a journey together, ostensibly a wine tour, or in this case, to review posh restaurants, but what both films are really about is two men facing down their respective mid life crisises with plenty of time to talk about it while on the road. That is what The Trip is about, at least the subtext--the sideways trip.Now that I have compared and contrasted these two films, I am required by law to rate them, so The Trip isn't as brilliant as Sideways, but it is brilliant in its own way. The Trip is actually culled from a television program, so you could say it is like a made-for-TV movie--but at least it was British television.  It actually seems more like a documentary, or even real life. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon play fictional versions of themselves that share some of the same curriculum vitae.Steve: Death is but a moment... Cowardice is a lifetime of affliction.The two actually began playing slightly fictionalized versions of themselves in Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story. That was about the difficulty of getting a literary work of Tristam Shandy's magnitude on film, but it showed the comic possibilities of pairing Coogan and Brydon. Brydon is exactly the kind of person that would drive a pompous egomaniac like Coogan bonkers. In Britain, he is actually better known than Coogan, but his success rests on a totally frivolous comedy bit where he impersonates the voice of a tiny man stuck in a box. That, and silly impersonations of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Al Pacino, and Woody Allen. Steve Coogan's disdain for such frivolity is only equaled by his competitiveness and need to try and prove that he can do them better:Steve, Rob: Come, come, Mr. Bond, you derive as much pleasure from killing as I do.The dueling Michael Caine impersonations are kind of a running gag. Repeated ad infinitum, the sheer redundancy becomes the joke. It culminates in a visit to Bolton Abbey, an historical site that inspired Wordsworth to write The White Doe of Rylstone. When Brydan memorizes said verse, partly to intimidate Coogan, he is compelled to recite it in the voice of Ian McKellan, because he is from Bolton. Never mind that the Bolton Ian is from is a neighborhood near Manchester, with little or no connection to Bolton Abbey. This really sticks in Coogan's craw.I know on paper and in this review you might be thinking that this kind of humor is a trifle too dry for your taste, but it's funny. Trust me.

The Trip is no where near as intellectual or, to some, annoying as My Dinner With Andre.The film opens with Steve Coogan calling Rob Brydon to join him on a driving trip to sample a number of restaurants. Steve calls Rob after his girl friend backs down, and Coogan can't find anybody else to join him. The film is broken into days and frankly, not a lot happens. They drive, they eat, they sleep, they talk, and they both talk about and to the people they've left behind. But that's kind of the enjoyment of this little film. Coogan is a fairly well known British television comedian and is genuinely funny. Brydon claims to do excellent imitations of people. Michael Cain is his favorite.The scenery is gorgeous.The film is a bit long at an hour and forty seven minutes. It is possible to watch the film in installments, stopping at the title for a new day. The film is surprisingly well shot. It feels like a documentary, but is more likely a scripted film. The director cuts away to some excellent kitchen scenes of meals being prepared. I like the technique of a clip from the kitchen preparing the appetizer just after they order their food. Then cut back to service, the guys taste the food, and then cut back to the kitchen for the main course preparation. Wine tasting and service was also captured in an unusual way.The strangest part of this DVD is the bonus features. Oddly, the deleted scenes are as long as the movie. Seriously, the deleted scenes are an hour and forty minutes. Normally that would be just plain awful. Instead, the deleted scenes are outstanding. They are montages of major things that happened during the trip. The first is wine tasting. The fifteen minutes about wine tasting developed an independent story arc about Coogan not understanding how to taste wine. In some ways, the deleted scenes are almost better than the movie.I'm a minor fan of Coogan, he's been on Top Gear (there's even a joke about that in the movie) and Graham Norton. He's a dead pan funny person.Not a great movie by any means, but one that is worth watching. It is a pleasant funny time to spend with two people on a road trip.

The Trip is supposed to be a comedy about two well-known actor friends -- one whose career is slightly on the wane, the other who is doing well -- as they tour England's scenic Lake District and eat out at fine restaurants every day. Sadly, it's a mess. The supposedly witty repartee consists of the duo doing stupid impressions and the movie quickly loses any charm it began with as the director openly mocks the restaurants and their elaborate cuisine. The successful actor has a wife and baby, the other has an ex, at least one unhappy child, and a girlfriend who has just decamped to the United States. It's not at all clear whether she'll be back. There is one good line -- ""you have momentum when going downhill"" -- but the rest of it is a self-indulgent mess. The unhappy actor has a couple of one-night stands he lies about and as the film crawls towards the end you just want it to be over. Once the two men have returned, we see the successful actor at home with wife and baby and the other man alone in his apartment, large drink in hand, alone (did I say alone already?), looking sadly out over the London skyline.

1421211,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B004NJR4EO,DVD Verdict,"[4, 4]","Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --Adapted from a 6-episode BBC2 series of the same name for exhibition in theaters, I was worried that The Trip would be muddled and confusing. For those who watched the series, I guess it still might be, but the film version is still a charming and amusing road trip. The combination of travel, food porn, and droll conversation works extremely well. Slowly paced and with nearly entirely improvised dialog, the film feels almost like non-fiction. Without the dream sequences that occasionally get thrown in, you could almost mistake it for documentary. Plot is nearly non-existent and the narrative drive almost totally comes down to moving on to the next locale in the morning, but it works. At most, we get some conversations between Coogan and his girlfriend and a couple of successful attempts of his to seduce desk clerks and the like, but none of that is really as important as the experience of the travel, which the two actors represent very well.Nearly all of the success lies at the feet of Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, who have a clear chemistry from their times together before. Anybody who has taken a road trip with a dubious companion can easily understand the acidic relationship between the car mates. They certainly have a history together and, in a sense, are definitely friends, but they spend so much time irritating each other with impersonations and undercutting the other's successes that the friendship is hard to see sometimes. But it sits under the surface and, as they sit in the car or the restaurant riffing on Michael Caine's progressively shifting accent, you can see it bubble up. Their reactions seem as natural in the scene as my own watching it; an especially funny line from Brydon makes Coogan crack up as much as it does me. I appreciate the authenticity of it and really enjoyed their dialog, even if the film is dramatically stunted.Michael Winterbottom's direction is very solid, as well. He has a good sense of pacing, never lingering too long in the car or on a plate of food. Between location and travel footage, close up shots of high-end cuisine, and long dialogs between the actors, there's a lot for him to get to, but he covers everything in a satisfying way. After seeing the film, I wonder if the series would feel tedious and overlong, but that's for another time. This is a quiet film without much that will be overly exciting, but is an intelligent and witty time that will be easy and fun to revisit.From MTI and IFC Films, the disc for The Trip is very good. I'd like to see it on Blu-ray, though, because while the image is acceptable, it's a little soft. The landscapes are gorgeous and I'd love to see them in better detail than we find here. The colors look natural and very nice, but the backgrounds just don't have the definition I was looking for. The sound is average and nothing special. The dialog is all perfectly clear and the music from Michael Nyman (The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover) comes through pretty well. Almost nothing is done in the surround channels, though, bringing the sum total down a little bit. It's the slate of extras where the disc shines. For those bemoaning the edit of the show into the film, the deleted scenes should satisfy them a little bit. Having never seen the series, I have to assume that the more than a hundred minutes of deleted scenes encompasses much of the series, which featured six half-hour episodes. The time comes out pretty close, at least, though the disc never advertises them as such. They are not in episode form, so come off a little disjointed, but the footage is there. The disc continues with a short piece detailing the meals that the duo eats during their travels. It's pure food porn, but the food looks nice and tasty, so I can't complain.

Initially designated to a very limited release, the film received great word of mouth largely due to a scene featuring dueling Michael Caine impersonations which became an outright cultural phenomenon. With this sequence becoming a genuine YouTube sensation, the movie eventually rolled out to a much wider distribution in over 100 major markets. It's an interesting success story about this unassuming little film that redefines the road movie AND the art of conversation. Interestingly enough, the movie is simply a condensed version of a six part television series that aired in Britain in 2010 (which incidentally won Steve Coogan a BAFTA for Best Male Performance in a Comedy). If you've had the opportunity to see the original source material, you will obviously be familiar with the content of Winterbottom's film. It utilizes the exact same footage. But in ""The Trip,"" the narrative is tightened up for an enjoyable two hour ride.In truth, there's not a lot of plotting to ""The Trip."" Comedian Coogan and the fantastic Rob Brydon play fictional counterparts of their real life personas. Coogan has been contracted by a local paper to review a series of the country's finest restaurants. When his girlfriend backs out on the trip, Coogan scrambles for a replacement settling for a friendly acquaintance that he has worked with in the past (Brydon). In a largely improvisational manner, the two companions bicker and provoke one another with a playful respect. Brydon continually lapses into terrific impersonations and challenges Coogan to much verbal sparring. Over the course of numerous meals and much travel time, the movie plays as the daft cousin to ""My Dinner With Andre"" as the two showbiz professionals ruminate on life, love, food, friendship, and career. That's really about it, but the film is never short of fascinating. Coogan's character has an underlying insecurity and his bluster with Brydon alternates between silliness and scathing wit.If the idea of watching two friends talking sounds excruciating to you, you probably aren't the movie's intended audience. ""The Trip,"" despite its adherence to improvisational dialogue, is easily one of the year's smartest and most literate films. Coogan and Brydon are perfect guides on this journey which also features enough restaurant footage and gourmet dishes to engage even the most discerning foodie. While there are no big dramatic revelations, the film does subtly get under your skin. By the end, you realize that this friendly excursion has caused each to realize what is important in life. In fact, it's a very understated film amidst some big comic grandstanding. Anyway, check this one out if you enjoy bright dialogue and are a fan of Coogan and/or Brydon. It's a winner.

Both Coogan and Brydon are good for a laugh a minute, or more like four a minute, and their chemistry makes this film. Although they're meant to be at odds a lot, you can see them each almost cracking up much of the time. They each do great voices, and the famous Caine scene is sweet indeed but the ""rise in the morning"" bit is the real highlight here, a truly fine bit that can stand proudly alongside the best of Python, The Office, Fawlty Towers and other Brit classics.The side plot of Steve being a sad yet randy actor on the make is quite entertaining, and wondering where fiction stops and reality starts is some of the fun here. Hearing so many fine voices and bits of poetry and film quotes is another, as are the brilliant shots of the northern British countryside. This makes a fine travel ad for the area.But the weirdest part of this film is all the food porn! Looong, loving shots of glistening scallops being seared to perfection and then fluffy foam being gently ladled on top of the juicy bit of fish, along with bits of watercress and powdered unicorn horn. It kind of distracts from the comedy but as jarring cuts go it's a delicious one.

Certainly well worth watching. Plus another 13 minutes of all the food porn collected into one long mouth-watering run of very fine looking gourmet chow.All in all, a fine film.

David Marquet,"[0, 0]","The Trip is ostensibly about a food critic (Steve Coogan) who has been asked by his employer (The Observer) to do a week-long food review of Northern England. His girlfriend, Mischa, has cancelled on him and returned to America and Steve asks a friend (Rob Brydon) to go along with him. It is apparent at the outset that the two, Rob and Steve, don't know each other all that well with the implication that, perhaps, Steve doesn't have all that many close friends.Playing themselves, Steve is the more famous one and seems to be a magnet for cute Northern waitresses and innkeepers but he is forever unsure of himself and misses Mischa. Rob, although apparently not achieving the acclaim of Steve, is happily married with a young child. They reveal vulnerabilities as they verbally spar and wrestle with their mid-life identities. At the end Steve returns to his luxury apartment, alone and Rob rejoins his family.The scenery is wonderful and the food scenes are great.

Before I 'google' them I will give an unprepared response to watching THE TRIP.I am still not sure quite what roles they played.  I got the impression that one or both of them are professional impersonators and/or television actors.  If that is so, and they are playing themselves, that makes the movie a kind of humorous documentary about them.  But then the set-up is fictional --- clearly they are not really doing restaurant reviews, as they took no interest and made virtualy no comment about the food.  So what exactly is this movie?  I saw no moral stance from the director/writer.  That is, the unrelenting self-serving, mutual-admiration, boys-club spiel went on and on, without the audience being told that they were behaving like jerks.  Not implicit and not explicit.The women in the movie were directed to be self-effacing and giggly-admiring --- so no criticism there either.  The two men, with their droopy smiles, come across in body language and in speech like two private-school boys who have not quite grown up. They have no interest in the world or other people or in each other except as sounding boards for their own desperate wit.  Is that what they were scripted / directed to do, and if so, where is the movie denouement?  A lonely Steve and a family-man Rob at the end do not suffice as a 'message', if that ending was so intended. Perhaps the movie was a satire on expensive self-indulgent television programming  -- the expensive vehicle, meals, hotels, a professional photographer travelling across the UK to take half a dozen snapshots of Steve.So, I am baffled and frustrated.  The closest 'similarity' in movie making is the brilliant classic MY DINNER WITH ANDRE, which despite being 99% talking heads in a static restaurant, was enthralling.I just wish I knew what Winterbottom was doing in THE TRIP.  I accept that perhaps it was made for a UK television-familiar audience who would find some common ground with what's on the screen.  I did laugh out loud in one brief scene.  After about 15 minutes I began to hate the two men, but I think NOT because Winterbottom was painting them to be hated.So, a completely unprepared response, and now I will look at other reviews and 'google' the casr.",1,I did not like this film,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,2322,"['Living', 'Canada', 'not', 'having', 'television', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Rob', 'Steve', 'movie', ""'google"", 'will', 'give', 'unprepared', 'response', 'watching', 'THE', 'TRIP.I', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'quite', 'what', 'played', 'got', 'impression', 'one', 'are', 'professional', 'impersonators', 'and/or', 'television', 'actors', 'so', 'are', 'playing', 'movie', 'kind', 'humorous', 'documentary', 'then', 'set-up', 'fictional', 'clearly', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'doing', 'restaurant', 'reviews', 'took', 'interest', 'made', 'virtualy', 'comment', 'food', 'what', 'exactly', 'movie', 'saw', 'moral', 'stance', 'director/writer', 'unrelenting', 'self-serving', 'mutual-admiration', 'boys-club', 'spiel', 'went', 'audience', 'being', 'told', 'were', 'behaving', 'jerks', 'Not', 'implicit', 'not', 'explicit.The', 'women', 'movie', 'were', 'directed', 'be', 'self-effacing', 'giggly-admiring', 'so', 'criticism', 'there', 'either', 'two', 'men', 'droopy', 'smiles', 'come', 'body', 'language', 'speech', 'two', 'private-school', 'boys', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'quite', 'grown', 'up', 'have', 'interest', 'world', 'other', 'people', 'other', 'sounding', 'boards', 'own', 'desperate', 'wit', 'what', 'were', 'scripted', '/', 'directed', 'do', 'so', 'where', 'movie', 'denouement', 'A', 'lonely', 'Steve', 'family-man', 'Rob', 'end', 'do', 'not', 'suffice', ""'message"", 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'intended', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'was', 'satire', 'expensive', 'self-indulgent', 'television', 'programming', 'expensive', 'vehicle', 'meals', 'hotels', 'professional', 'photographer', 'travelling', 'UK', 'take', 'dozen', 'snapshots', 'Steve.So', 'am', 'baffled', 'frustrated', 'closest', ""'similarity"", 'movie', 'making', 'brilliant', 'classic', 'MY', 'DINNER', 'WITH', 'ANDRE', 'being', '99', '%', 'talking', 'heads', 'static', 'restaurant', 'was', 'enthralling.I', 'just', 'wish', 'knew', 'what', 'Winterbottom', 'was', 'doing', 'TRIP', 'accept', 'perhaps', 'was', 'made', 'UK', 'television-familiar', 'audience', 'who', 'would', 'find', 'common', 'ground', 'what', 'screen', 'did', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'brief', 'scene', '15', 'minutes', 'began', 'hate', 'two', 'men', 'think', 'NOT', 'Winterbottom', 'was', 'painting', 'be', 'hated.So', 'completely', 'unprepared', 'response', 'now', 'will', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', ""'google"", 'casr']",N/A

Power ""nlp trainer""","[6, 8]","I suppose the best way to describe this is that it's comedic Spinal Tap meets Monty Python, meets travelogue..Steve Coogan reminds me a little of Eric Idle, of Monty Python. I had been watching the ads for this movie on my cable on demand, and liked the Michael Caine bits that he and Rob Brydon did, and it was showing at a local theater so i decided to go.So, Steve Coogan gets offered an opportunity to travel all over northern England, for the Observer, and write a critique about certain restaurants. His girlfriend and he are on hiatus, so as a second choice, he asks friend and well known Welsh impersonator Rob Brydon to tag along.I am fairly familiar with Coogan from various movies over here, and totally unfamiliar with Brydon, who is a latter day Mike Yarwood. Although the premise does not sound particularly promising, I totally adored the way these characters played off each other.There were some genius comics sparks that kept me laughing throughout, and not just me, the semi full theater laughed along with it too.It's difficult to know where Steve Coogan the character, and Steve Coogan the person begins and ends, but I loved the many many excellent bits in this movie, where they do round robin impersonations, such as Caine, Connery, Schwarzenegger, Woody Allen, and one or two I did not recognise. There were other scenes with other characters, and I loved the narcissistic understated twist of Coogan's character. I really hope we will see more of him. I will say though that sometimes he comes across like Russell Brand's slightly depressed young uncle. I get the sense that much of this was improvised, and I love spontaneity, just watching two creative people go at it.Rob Brydon who I had not heard of before, and who clearly appears to be friends with Coogan in real life, impressed me greatly, and I liked his Hugh Grant impersonation, Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton and his Little Man in a box routine.While watching this movie I was distracted by a leggy blond sitting two seats over, and she had a boyfriend. Darn.My favorite line apart from the one at the top of this review:""Don't come running to me with your broken leg.""So, if you like British humor, which can be quite subtle and understated, and more nuanced than what you get in American comedy, I think you will love this as much as I do.Since seeing this, a movie buff friend recommendedHamlet 2, also starring Elisabeth Shue, Catherine Keener, and  David Arquette, and made by some of the people who made South Park.  It's somewhat of a parody on inspiring teacher movies, Hamlet, and a few others which might not meet censorship guidelines here on Amazon.  It was a no brainer for me to buy because of it's pricing, and I don't how long the price will stay that low.  Very enjoyable.I unreservedly love it, and i think you will too.

Coogan's character... during the scene in the grave yard, when he was giving the fake eulogy for Rob, his sentiments obviously echoed the feelings that he harbored for himself. This movie and the characters were very well developed. I like that the impetus for 'the trip' was a food expedition, and that it was not the primary focus. It was a layer, the locations were another, the mains another, the adjunct characters another. It loved that Brydon and Coogan 'played themselves', and I loved the juxtaposition of their private lives -- Coogan's lonely to Brydon's fulfilled -- it added another element/layer to the story. And all in all, I found it very rich, meticulously woven and very well sorted out. Great find.

The assignment is to visit and report on a tour of some of the country's most respected, if remote, eateries.  When Steve Coogan first accepts the journalism job, he imagines it as a perfect getaway with his pretty girlfriend.  But at the last minute, she backs out and Coogan invites his best friend (and source of endless irritation) the happily married, new father, Rob Brydon.These two real friends -- yes, the two gifted actors and funnymen are actual rivals of a sort, as are all actors -- embark on a road trip that allows them to riff on all kinds of things from fame to fatherhood to food.  But it's the incredibly sublime impersonations that charge this slightly unhinged duo's increasingly intense arguments over -- of all things -- the proper vocalization of Michael Caine's inimitable and distinctive voice.  What makes it deliriously funny is both Coogan and Brydon will not let go of the one-upmanship or the criticism of the other's Caine impression.  The dissect changing vocal minutia during different aspects of Caine's career -- and then each man offers ever more hilariously accurate intonations of Caine's shifting tones and accents in various vintage and recent films.  There were moments when I could hardly catch my breath.  This is a smart, literate comedy.

1421248,A1WBXDI7LRPLXB,B004NJR4EO,R. Sohi,"[3, 5]","Michael Winterbottom, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon reunited five years after their previous collaboration, Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story, to make this very enjoyable six part series for the BBC.  Each episode is under half an hour.  The series was reedited into a feature length film.  I've seen both but saw the series first.  They're both good but you probably only need to see one.  I'd chose the series because it's looser and allows you to savour the experience of watching it for longer.  The film works very well too and my only slightly decreased enjoyment of it was probably just due to the fact that I'd seen all the scenes before.There isn't much of a plot as the focus here is on tone.  The Steve Coogan character calls Rob Brydon and asks him to accompany him to the north of England to sample some of the finest restaurants in the area with the intention of writing about the experience for an article for The Observer.  The original plan had been for Coogan to make the trip with his girlfriend (the real ""foodie"" of the couple) but she took a job in the U.S. as their relationship became strained.  The series follows the two actors eating at various restaurants (one per episode) while trying to outdo each other with impersonations of famous actors and exchanging stories/thoughts about their lives. Interspersed through these scenes are Coogan's attempts at connecting with his girlfriend via telephone as he walks about the beautiful landscape (usually at dusk).  As noted by the other reviewer it's a subtle film.  The humour is low key and there is a recurring feeling of melancholy as the Coogan character struggles to cope with his obvious unhappiness.  The acting, cinematography, writing and direction are all top notch.The series/film reminded me of the great British film ""Withnail and I.""  Both are about a couple of self-absorbed actors who leave London for the country seeking some rejuvenation.  The dynamics between the characters are similar too as they constantly jab at each other.  The Withnail/Steve Coogan characters are a bit more self-absorbed while the Marwick or I/Rob Brydon characters are a bit more grounded.  The comedy, entertaining though it is, in both cases is also just a veneer for something darker.  It's perhaps noteworthy that both films reference the ""what a piece of work is a man"" soliloquy from Hamlet to emphasize the discontentment and sense of failure felt by the main characters. Unlike the older film, the characters in The Trip are not heavy substance abusers (there is substance use but nothing compared to the levels in Withnail and I). Interestingly one of the characters quips at one point something to the effect, ""I celebrated my 20th birthday with alcohol, my 30th with drugs and my 40th with food.""In a sense The Trip is a glimpse of how the characters portrayed in Withnail and I might appear in middle age in current times.  Fans of the older film will undoubtedly find much to appreciate in this series but it's appeal shouldn't be limited to this group.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.",5,What a piece of work is a  man?,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,3082,"['Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Rob', 'Brydon', 'reunited', 'five', 'years', 'previous', 'collaboration', 'Tristram', 'Shandy', 'Cock', 'Bull', 'Story', 'make', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'six', 'part', 'series', 'BBC', 'episode', 'hour', 'series', 'was', 'reedited', 'feature', 'length', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'saw', 'series', 'first', ""'re"", 'good', 'probably', 'only', 'need', 'see', 'one', ""'d"", 'chose', 'series', 'looser', 'savour', 'experience', 'watching', 'longer', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'only', 'slightly', 'decreased', 'enjoyment', 'was', 'probably', 'just', 'due', 'fact', ""'d"", 'seen', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'much', 'plot', 'focus', 'here', 'tone', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'character', 'Rob', 'Brydon', 'accompany', 'north', 'England', 'sample', 'finest', 'restaurants', 'area', 'intention', 'writing', 'experience', 'article', 'Observer', 'original', 'plan', 'had', 'been', 'Coogan', 'make', 'trip', 'girlfriend', 'real', 'foodie', 'couple', 'took', 'job', 'U.S.', 'relationship', 'became', 'strained', 'series', 'two', 'actors', 'eating', 'various', 'restaurants', 'one', 'episode', 'trying', 'outdo', 'other', 'impersonations', 'famous', 'actors', 'exchanging', 'stories/thoughts', 'lives', 'Interspersed', 'scenes', 'are', 'Coogan', 'attempts', 'connecting', 'girlfriend', 'telephone', 'beautiful', 'landscape', 'usually', 'dusk', 'noted', 'other', 'reviewer', 'subtle', 'film', 'humour', 'low', 'key', 'recurring', 'feeling', 'melancholy', 'Coogan', 'character', 'cope', 'obvious', 'unhappiness', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'writing', 'direction', 'are', 'top', 'notch.The', 'series/film', 'reminded', 'great', 'British', 'film', 'Withnail', 'are', 'couple', 'self-absorbed', 'actors', 'who', 'leave', 'London', 'country', 'seeking', 'rejuvenation', 'dynamics', 'characters', 'are', 'similar', 'too', 'constantly', 'jab', 'other', 'Withnail/Steve', 'Coogan', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'self-absorbed', 'Marwick', 'I/Rob', 'Brydon', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'grounded', 'comedy', 'entertaining', 'cases', 'also', 'just', 'veneer', 'something', 'darker', 'perhaps', 'noteworthy', 'films', 'reference', 'what', 'piece', 'work', 'man', 'soliloquy', 'Hamlet', 'emphasize', 'discontentment', 'sense', 'failure', 'felt', 'main', 'characters', 'older', 'film', 'characters', 'Trip', 'are', 'not', 'heavy', 'substance', 'abusers', 'substance', 'use', 'nothing', 'compared', 'levels', 'Withnail', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'characters', 'quips', 'one', 'point', 'something', 'effect', 'celebrated', '20th', 'birthday', 'alcohol', '30th', 'drugs', '40th', 'food', 'sense', 'Trip', 'glimpse', 'how', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Withnail', 'might', 'appear', 'middle', 'age', 'current', 'times', 'Fans', 'older', 'film', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'find', 'much', 'appreciate', 'series', 'appeal', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'limited', 'group', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'minute']",N/A

The actors played themselves so if all they do is show off and talk about their awards doesn't that make this self-promotion? Anyway I enjoyed the idea of watching people in England go on a true road trip. However, the scenery/countryside is the bleakest most depressing scenery I have seen in a very long time. And when they started mentioning the English literary settings . . . I could just imagine Tess of the D'urbvilles rounding one of those roads or Moll Flanders lurking around one of those buildings. Or Hardy's Jude walking from one of those towns to the other. Yuck. And when the guy said that the one day was perfect as the sun was shining (among other things) I was like yeah . . . right . . . it was not only plain barren looking land but gloomy. And the characters were supposed to be funny and while not depressing they rarely if ever smiled. When they did their entire faces lit up and they looked like different people. And the one guy would not stop doing impressions. Enough already. With them talking about themselves and their ""careers"" so much I thought I was watching Regis and Kathy Lee Live! back in the 90s.

Both 24 Hour Party People and Tristam Shandy rank among my favorite movies of all time. However, I am not going to be so blind in my affection that I won't admit that both of these talents have let me down in the past. Michael Winterbottom sought out to make a movie about the claustrophobia of a bad relationship in 9 Songs and succeeded in his ambition at the expense of the audience. Steve Coogan's British material is the kind of hacky catch-phrase imitation garbage that Ricky Gervais so easily parodied in the second season of Extras.This movie combines the worst aspects of both directors. Winterbottom may do great stuff when he is letting the action unfold at its own pace but at times it gets tedious with with near contempt for the audience. There are points where Steve Coogan knows that his audience loves him and he gets as lazy as Margaret Cho. In this movie, Steve Coogan meanders about with his friend in a fake road trip directed (barely) by Winterbottom. They drive, they eat, they talk.Most of the humor comes from competing imitations. Even though early in the movie, Coogan states that imitations are idiotic, that is supposed to be ironic since neither actor will give them up.This is a dull insipid piece by people who are much too talented to make this kind of dreck.",2,Tedious little number,1366675200,"04 23, 2013",2013,1386,"['Normally', 'like', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'movies', 'especially', 'when', 'working', 'Steve', 'Coogan', '24', 'Hour', 'Party', 'People', 'Tristam', 'Shandy', 'rank', 'favorite', 'movies', 'time', 'However', 'am', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'so', 'blind', 'affection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'admit', 'talents', 'have', 'let', 'down', 'past', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'sought', 'out', 'make', 'movie', 'claustrophobia', 'bad', 'relationship', '9', 'Songs', 'succeeded', 'ambition', 'expense', 'audience', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'British', 'material', 'kind', 'hacky', 'catch-phrase', 'imitation', 'garbage', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'easily', 'parodied', 'second', 'season', 'Extras.This', 'movie', 'worst', 'aspects', 'directors', 'Winterbottom', 'may', 'do', 'great', 'stuff', 'when', 'letting', 'action', 'unfold', 'own', 'pace', 'times', 'tedious', 'near', 'contempt', 'audience', 'are', 'points', 'where', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'audience', 'as', 'lazy', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'meanders', 'friend', 'fake', 'road', 'trip', 'directed', 'barely', 'Winterbottom', 'drive', 'eat', 'talk.Most', 'humor', 'competing', 'imitations', 'Even', 'early', 'movie', 'Coogan', 'imitations', 'are', 'idiotic', 'supposed', 'be', 'ironic', 'actor', 'will', 'give', 'dull', 'insipid', 'piece', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'much', 'too', 'talented', 'make', 'kind', 'dreck']",N/A
