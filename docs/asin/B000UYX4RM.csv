1097735,ABARNA66MT43U,B000UYX4RM,Bonemonkey,"[1, 1]","When I first watched this film I didn't get the plot and I still don't get it. I think it's got something to do with water goblins, or a detective, or a being that's trying to take over the city. Karas is a being that's watching over the city. Some other beings are watching over him. Other beings are hoping to fight him. Another being is helping him. OK thats the plot covered...This film just looks great. It kicks off with a stunning action sequence that straight away shows what's instore. There is a fairly long chunk until the next action part but it's all well animated and kept my attention. It's only worth buying parts 1 & 2 together as they make up 1 film thats been chopped in half. The 2nd part sees the city under attack and a monster who enjoys eating humans for lunch (worth waiting for). The soundtrack and character voices are excellent. The spooky counting up to &#34;and it is 10&#34; is generally heard before a battle. This film isn't perfect but shows whats possible in anime and is definitely worth watching. Just don't expect to know what on earth it was all about afterwards. Sit back, enjoy the animation and visuals.

These are visually stunning movies with exquisitely (and sometimes grotesquely) rendered images.  However, as dazzling as the artwork is, the story leaves much to be desired.  At all times purposely obscure, it is more than just a little difficult to follow.  What begins as simply bewildering soon becomes annoying, a mindless tease for reasons unknown.  What made this even worse was when the story was finally revealed it was so simplistic in nature that a mere sentence could sum it up: making this much ado about absolutely nothing.  This is storytelling at its worse; barely above mindless rambling.The story: in a city where demons are forgotten by humans, a battle ensues to teach the humans a lesson and to bring an oppressor to power over all.

1097745,A392BGTO28EN6V,B000UYX4RM,"S. Jenkins ""Arshes Nei""","[24, 30]","I actually bumped into this box set this weekend. I like how they did the box design. They kept the two dvds in their original clamshells, but I only opened the 2nd one and didn't find any inserts (not sure if all are like that or if the separate dvd does have promotional materials).The box set is definitely worth getting if you want to continue the widescreen experience in the second part.The pacing of the story seems to be bit slower in some areas, and the sound isn't as fantastic as the first part. I just felt the music, pacing and sound was excellent especially in that hospital chase in the 1st one.There was a change in cast, as Yurine is done by another voice actress, but although noticeable, she was still an excellent replacement. In a lot of ways I find the dub surpasses the original Japanese voice acting. For example in the first DVD I really love how they changed one of the characters with a creepy electronic voice.You will get backstory into Otaha which is great, in the second DVD you'll learn more of what a Karas is. I'm very much hoping for a spinoff due to the potential of the series.I think there are some drawbacks in the second part, such as the animation quality seemed to have dropped a bit. Example is when characters are doing attacks it looked like they forgot to render some backgrounds as they would in the first dvd.I found the conclusion very fitting, and I'm definitely not upset at the ending. Otaha is an extremely interesting character.I kinda wished they'd have more interaction with other characters like Nue and the Snail guy in the second part, but I was amused by the female character that accompanies the other Yurine.I had thought about knocking this down a star, but in all honesty I find that the series is just an excellent addition to add to anyone's collection. The drawbacks are *extremely* minor. I found that their approach on mixing 3d with 2d elements of anime was just refreshing, they didn't bother making everything realistic and I found it worked just right, unlike the Final Fantasy Advent movie where it started looking cartoonish when they went through all the trouble of making something realistic and then added in cartoony moves on the characters.Karas is an excellent animation to show to people at the very least in technical aspects that won't bore people like Ghost in the Shell may.",5,Excellent Box Set,1193529600,"10 28, 2007",2007,2360,"['actually', 'bumped', 'box', 'set', 'weekend', 'like', 'how', 'did', 'box', 'design', 'kept', 'two', 'dvds', 'original', 'clamshells', 'only', 'opened', '2nd', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'inserts', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'separate', 'dvd', 'have', 'promotional', 'materials', '.The', 'box', 'set', 'definitely', 'worth', 'getting', 'want', 'continue', 'widescreen', 'experience', 'second', 'part.The', 'pacing', 'story', 'be', 'bit', 'slower', 'areas', 'sound', ""n't"", 'as', 'fantastic', 'first', 'part', 'just', 'felt', 'music', 'pacing', 'sound', 'was', 'excellent', 'especially', 'hospital', 'chase', '1st', 'one.There', 'was', 'change', 'cast', 'Yurine', 'done', 'voice', 'actress', 'noticeable', 'was', 'still', 'excellent', 'replacement', 'lot', 'ways', 'find', 'dub', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'acting', 'example', 'first', 'DVD', 'really', 'love', 'how', 'changed', 'one', 'characters', 'creepy', 'electronic', 'voice.You', 'will', 'get', 'backstory', 'Otaha', 'great', 'second', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'more', 'what', 'Karas', ""'m"", 'very', 'much', 'hoping', 'spinoff', 'due', 'potential', 'series.I', 'think', 'are', 'drawbacks', 'second', 'part', 'such', 'animation', 'quality', 'seemed', 'have', 'dropped', 'bit', 'Example', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'doing', 'attacks', 'looked', 'forgot', 'render', 'backgrounds', 'would', 'first', 'dvd.I', 'found', 'conclusion', 'very', 'fitting', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'not', 'upset', 'ending', 'Otaha', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'character.I', 'kinda', 'wished', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'interaction', 'other', 'characters', 'Nue', 'Snail', 'guy', 'second', 'part', 'was', 'amused', 'female', 'character', 'other', 'Yurine.I', 'had', 'thought', 'about', 'knocking', 'down', 'star', 'honesty', 'find', 'series', 'just', 'excellent', 'addition', 'add', 'anyone', 'collection', 'drawbacks', 'are', '*extremely*', 'minor', 'found', 'approach', 'mixing', '3d', '2d', 'elements', 'anime', 'was', 'just', 'refreshing', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'making', 'everything', 'realistic', 'found', 'worked', 'just', 'right', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Advent', 'movie', 'where', 'started', 'looking', 'cartoonish', 'when', 'went', 'trouble', 'making', 'something', 'realistic', 'then', 'added', 'cartoony', 'moves', 'characters.Karas', 'excellent', 'animation', 'show', 'people', 'very', 'least', 'technical', 'aspects', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bore', 'people', 'Ghost', 'Shell', 'may']",Karas: The Complete Collection (The Prophecy / The Revelation)
