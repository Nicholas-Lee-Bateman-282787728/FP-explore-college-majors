310402,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302390478,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 4]","It's almost laughable to me that people thought (or still think) that the screenplay for `Grand Canyon' was its best asset.  I mean, seriously, this is `Crash' level sized awfulness in a cup.  The clich&eacute;d themes and the preposterous overwrought-ness of the whole thing is enough to make you nauseous with stupidity.  There isn't a sincere note in the script, even though it tries really hard to make you think it is.  That is another problem, but the Ron Howard-esque schmaltzy saccharine sympathies lathered onto the main characters is just unflattering and really makes the audience (or at least me) cringe with discomfort.Why are you trying so hard?But alas, there is a redeeming factor here, and in keeping with my `Crash' comparison, it is the acting.  When it comes to ensemble performances, `Grand Canyon' hit a jackpot.  Nearly every player is giving it their all, and while they are left juggling some unwelcomed ridiculousness, they handle it with more class than it is worth.  Danny Glover is especially timely as the soft spoken yet firm tow-truck driver who is hesitant to accept that gratitude of Kevin Kline's character.  The way he delivers a subtle low-key performance is commendable considering that theatrical nature of the film itself.There are a few films that have tackled this `interwoven' tapestry like way of storytelling, and I happen to like this type of film as a rule.  I appreciate Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu more than most, and we all know that Robert Altman might as well have invented this `genre' since he basically mastered it.  Sadly, Lawrence Kasdan doesn't weave this story in a way that feels compelling or even moving.  It feels so forced and so overdone that it leaves an uneasy feeling on my stomach.",2,Not so grand...,1340236800,"06 21, 2012",2012,1771,"['almost', 'laughable', 'people', 'thought', 'still', 'think', 'screenplay', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'was', 'best', 'asset', 'mean', 'seriously', 'Crash', 'level', 'sized', 'awfulness', 'cup', 'clich', 'eacute', 'themes', 'preposterous', 'overwrought-ness', 'whole', 'thing', 'enough', 'make', 'nauseous', 'stupidity', ""n't"", 'sincere', 'note', 'script', 'even', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'think', 'problem', 'Ron', 'Howard-esque', 'schmaltzy', 'saccharine', 'sympathies', 'lathered', 'main', 'characters', 'just', 'unflattering', 'really', 'audience', 'least', 'cringe', 'discomfort.Why', 'are', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'alas', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'here', 'keeping', 'Crash', 'comparison', 'acting', 'When', 'ensemble', 'performances', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'Nearly', 'player', 'giving', 'are', 'left', 'juggling', 'unwelcomed', 'ridiculousness', 'handle', 'more', 'class', 'worth', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'especially', 'timely', 'soft', 'spoken', 'yet', 'firm', 'tow-truck', 'driver', 'who', 'hesitant', 'accept', 'gratitude', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'character', 'way', 'subtle', 'low-key', 'performance', 'commendable', 'considering', 'theatrical', 'nature', 'film', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'have', 'tackled', 'interwoven', 'tapestry', 'way', 'storytelling', 'happen', 'like', 'type', 'film', 'rule', 'appreciate', 'Alejandro', 'Gonz', 'aacute', 'ntilde', 'aacute', 'more', 'most', 'know', 'Robert', 'Altman', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'invented', 'genre', 'basically', 'mastered', 'Sadly', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', ""n't"", 'weave', 'story', 'way', 'compelling', 'even', 'moving', 'so', 'forced', 'so', 'overdone', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'stomach']",N/A
310403,A10GLKTPF3MMUM,6302390478,"Andrew J. DiLiddo Jr. ""Big_Man_Big_Heart_Fine...","[10, 12]","This is truly a great film. Great Character Development against an Urban Backdrop!I heartily agree with all the comments of the reviewers above who rated this flick positively.As for the folks who didn't like this flick, I believe they just don't have the frontal lobe capacity to understand it.  One guy criticized the movie here because it was set in Los Angeles.??????  Woooosh! {flying over his head....duhhhhhhhh ]  He missed the point of the movie for sure.  The setting in LOS ANGELES was deliberate you moron!URBAN EXISTENTIAL ANGST, SPIRITUAL HEALING AND HOW TO BE HUMAN:The redeeming quality of this flick is how people came together for each other when all the odds were against that happening. All the characters are HUMAN and wounded in some way.  This is not a super hero movie folks.SAMPLE DIALOGUE:Mary Louis Parker's character , an office aide:  ""Jane,? [to Alfre Woodard at the lunch table] do you ever feel like your just this far away [ gesturing with a thumb and forefinger very close to touching but not] from being completely hysterical 24 hours a day?""JANE:  (Alfre Woodard) :  ""Half the people I know feel that way.  The LUCKY ones feel that way.  The rest of the people ARE hysterical 24 hours a day"".....  a succinct but poignant characterization of American life here to my mind....~~~~~~~~~~~  ok the bad reviewers here might think this is bad dialogue, but I maintain that the Kasdans who wrote this are making some very insightful commentary on our society today.MORE DIALOGUE:SIMON( Danny Glover) speaking to his nephew OTIS:  ""  [do] You wanna be a gang banger when you're 25 [years old]??OTIS [ Glover's nephew]  "" Sheeeet, [s**t] I'll never live to be 25 [years old]....ok ok, INANE DIALOGUE, Laughable?  maybe to some, but the sadness and irony of a young capable teenager believing he won't live until age 25 strikes me as pretty poignant AND a social commentary on life in the USA for a black urban teenager.For me, it was NOT a movie about racism. It is a movie about synchronicity (see the book ""The Celestine Prophecy"") for a story about synchronicity. Things happen = happenstance, random, coincidence, serendipitous......Danny Glover's performance in this movie was powerful! I really loved his character and all the scenes he is in. He takes care of his sister, niece and nephew while he chats on a deaf enabled telephone to his deaf daughter who lives in Washington D.C. Technologically, a precursor look at Instant Messaging circa 1990that people who are deaf used with a phone and a modem.So, even though Simon is a tow truck driver, he uses this technology in his home to be a father to his daughter. He helps Mack, Kevin Kline's character and Mack and Simon develop a friendship. I found this a very realistic theme. I have had similar experiences.The actress who played Simon's sister was dynamite as she portrayed her sheer terror, panic and hysteria as her humble home is riddled with gang's automatic weapons bullets. Her performance is of academy award caliber as is Danny Glover's. The little girl who plays her daughter surviving automatic weapon fire into their home is incredible.  The day after the shooting of their home, Danny Glover is putting plywood up over the shot out windows while his sister sweeps up glass.  The little girl is out in yard playing with the FRICKIN' CRIME SCENE YELLOW TAPE like she is at a Maypole dance or at a Birthday Party playing with the crepe paper.  The irony is subtle maybe for some, but powerful.Alfre Woodard who plays Jane, who becomes Simon's main ""squeeze"" is also a powerful, powerful performance in its simplicity. The scene of Jane and Simon on their first date is definite academy ward winning acting.Mary McDonnell as Claire, is a powerful character. All the characters are well developed and different and there is depth to their personalities. Patrick Malone as Otis, Simon's nephew who does not believe he can survive past age 25 is excellent.Steve Martin as a movie producer who makes blood and guts moviesis a caricature and provides not so much comic relief as ""cad"" relief as he plays a louse. The scene of Steve Martin shot in the leg foaming at the mouth is horrible. Blood is a character in this movie. Blood being scrubbed off the sidewalk. Blood on a cutting board in the kitchen. Blood on the chest of an old man given CPR. Ambulances are a character throughout. There is an omnipresent police helicopter that is a device that separates the ""chapters"" or vignettes of the story. Architecture is interwoven as the beauty of the buildings and their patina in changing light is juxtaposed against the violence coming down around their beauty.DREAM SCENES:  Characters moving around in their DreamsDream sequences of Kevin Kline and Mary McDonell are bizarre and realistic, the way many of our dreams are and shows how we try to work out the issues in our lives in our dreams. There is a sequence of events where Kevin Kline cuts his finger preparing salad in the kitchen, immediately there is an earthquake, and the next door neighbor has a heart attack and the phone line to 911 is busy.....unrealistic???  I think not....ever hear the expression that disasters come in sets of three?  A great depiction of that here and it ties into the dream sequences as well.  To me, the dream sequences though on the surface can be categorized as ""sappy"" by some, indicated to me that the out of control events in the characters' lives even seep into their sleep.  They get no rest even while sleeping because the chaos of life enters into their dream life troubling them as if they were still awake.  Another commentary on contemporary life, to be sure.I found this to be a finely wrought, highly crafted film that I can watch repeatedly and never tire of. All the criticism of the film listed above and of the Kasdans as producers are pure idiocy. Those reviewers, I can only conclude, have not experienced the spiritual synchronicity depicted in the film and thus ""can't relate"" to it, don't see it as realistic. All of us are on spiritual journeys. Some of us are farther along than others. Kevin Cline's character meaningfully struggles with ""creative meddling"" that he does in other peoples' lives. I suspect many of us rarely introspect about the meddling or impact we have on others. As Mack says, we have to reach out to those who come into our lives and pull us back from the brink.This is truly a great film.",5,Watch this Over and Over and Over and then Watch it

310404,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6302390478,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is a very good movie. It's got heart. Kevin Kline plays a lawyer whose car breaks down in a bad neighborhood in LA. Danny Glover plays the tow-truck driver who rescues him. Steve Martin is his film producer friend who gets shot and decides to stop making the sleazy violent movies he's been making. We follow their stories separately and as they interact, in a montage that seems to have one great point to make. Just to prove it, this is the last line of the film: ""It's not all bad.""People have troubles, even bad troubles, but they also get lucky, sometimes in a sort of supernatural way. Kline's wife finds an abandoned baby in the park while she's running for exercise. She hands it over to the authorities, but begins procedures to adopt the adorable little girl. She jogs by a scruffy long-hair one day and gets frightened, finds him threatening. A couple days later, he walks past her and says ""Keep the kid. You need her as much as she needs you.""She has very few doubts, but Kline has more. Martin talks about it with him on the way home from the hospital, and talks about all the bad things like smelly diapers and not getting enough sleep. Then Martin's girlfriend starts to cry because she wants kids and figures they are never going to get married and have children, and Martin says ""Who says we aren't?""Coincidences happen; people do things that have major impact on someone else's life. Question is, are these miracles? As Kline's wife points out, ""Maybe we don't have enough experience with miracles so we don't recognize them when they happen."" And maybe there really is magic in love, in friendship, in people being good to one another.The relationship to the Grand Canyon comes right at the end, when Glover drives Kline and his family, Glover's sister and nephew, and his new girlfriend (introduced by Kline) to the Grand Canyon. But they had talked about it before; it was a symbol, a metaphor for them. Something so big and so long in the making, and still being carved out by the river even today. The canyon symbolizes the gulf between the haves and have-nots to Martin. And so Kline sums it up: ""It's not all bad.""A hard movie to explain, but a great one to watch, for all it is bloody in spots. This is, after all, LA, and some of the scenes are in the ghetto, and some are in Martin's gory movies.",4,Adorable Romantic Comedy,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,2330,"['very', 'good', 'movie', 'got', 'heart', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'lawyer', 'car', 'breaks', 'down', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'LA', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'tow-truck', 'driver', 'who', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'film', 'producer', 'friend', 'who', 'shot', 'decides', 'stop', 'making', 'sleazy', 'violent', 'movies', 'been', 'making', 'follow', 'stories', 'separately', 'interact', 'montage', 'have', 'one', 'great', 'point', 'make', 'Just', 'prove', 'last', 'line', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'People', 'have', 'troubles', 'even', 'bad', 'troubles', 'also', 'get', 'lucky', 'sometimes', 'sort', 'supernatural', 'way', 'Kline', 'wife', 'abandoned', 'baby', 'park', 'running', 'exercise', 'authorities', 'procedures', 'adopt', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'jogs', 'scruffy', 'long-hair', 'one', 'day', 'frightened', 'threatening', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'walks', 'Keep', 'kid', 'need', 'as', 'much', 'very', 'few', 'doubts', 'Kline', 'more', 'Martin', 'talks', 'way', 'home', 'hospital', 'talks', 'bad', 'things', 'smelly', 'diapers', 'not', 'getting', 'enough', 'sleep', 'Then', 'Martin', 'girlfriend', 'cry', 'kids', 'figures', 'are', 'never', 'going', 'get', 'married', 'have', 'children', 'Martin', 'Who', 'are', ""n't"", 'Coincidences', 'happen', 'people', 'do', 'things', 'have', 'major', 'impact', 'someone', 'else', 'life', 'Question', 'are', 'miracles', 'Kline', 'wife', 'points', 'out', 'Maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'experience', 'miracles', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'when', 'happen', 'maybe', 'really', 'magic', 'love', 'friendship', 'people', 'being', 'good', 'one', 'another.The', 'relationship', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'right', 'end', 'when', 'Glover', 'Kline', 'family', 'Glover', 'sister', 'nephew', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'introduced', 'Kline', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'had', 'talked', 'was', 'symbol', 'metaphor', 'Something', 'so', 'big', 'so', 'long', 'making', 'still', 'being', 'carved', 'out', 'river', 'even', 'today', 'canyon', 'gulf', 'haves', 'have-nots', 'Martin', 'so', 'Kline', 'sums', 'up', 'not', 'bad', 'hard', 'movie', 'explain', 'great', 'one', 'watch', 'bloody', 'spots', 'LA', 'scenes', 'are', 'ghetto', 'are', 'Martin', 'gory', 'movies']",N/A

310406,AX08QJGPHH149,6302390478,Ben Riddle,"[17, 20]","The first time I saw this movie, I saw the fear in Kevin Kline's eyes as  he is accosted by the black gang, heard the terror in Alfre Woodard's  screams for her daughter as their house is riddled with bullets.  I saw a  completely shocked Steve Martin frothing at the mouth after he was shot by  a street thug for his gold watch.  And sometime later I felt the fear of  his wife after he had a heart attack and almost died.The second time I  saw this movie, things looked totally different.  I was able to look beyond  the violence, pain, and everything else that seemed to make this movie look  like nothing more than a series of accidents waiting to happen, dashed with  pinches of comic relief from Steve Martin.  All of these things were there  the second time around, but now I saw the great differences in lifestyles  of middle class suburban white family and inner city black family.  And I  saw how the Grand Canyon is a kind of symbol of hope for them all in the  future.I believe the lesson to be learned from a movie like &quot;Grand  Canyon&quot; is that hope never dies.  Violence, suffering, crime, and pain  have always been and will continue to be parts of our lives.  Life is a  giant, constant struggle. What &quot;Grand Canyon&quot; teaches us is that  the struggle itself yields its own rewards.  We must all strive to be more  than we are now.

If you're looking for a in-depth review where each character's role is discussed, I left that to the experts.  I'm reviewing it because I'm motivated to share how I feel about it.  I was just sitting reading the paper on a rainy Sunday afternoon when I switched to the Encore channel on TV.  Grand Canyon was set to air.  Since Kevin Kline and Steve Martin happen to be two of my favorite actors and the title intrigued me--a comedy, perhaps, I decided to watch.  I'm glad I did.Whatever motivates some viewers to pan this movie surely is an alien feeling to me.  There's so much about this film that defies description--you have to ""feel"" it, you have to allow yourself to absorb each of the stories, place yourself in each of the characters' shoes and understand that this is life in all its raw, jaw-shattering reality.  I can't believe I missed this film when it first came out.  Perhaps I would have felt then as others do now but with the passing of time and my many experiences, the world's experiences, this is one unforgettable, meaningful film.  In some respects the underlying theme reminds me of Thoreau's quote:  ""Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to their graves with the song still in them"".  This is a story of people who found the song.Give yourself a chance.  Watch it.  You may begin to reflect on your life and look forward to the time you hopefully have left with new meaning and appreciation. Things that were once important to you may take a back seat and things that should have mattered more will.I certainly look forward to what Kasdan creates in the future.

310428,A1J2931UBBJPXM,6302390478,Reviewer,"[36, 38]","Early in this film one of the characters makes the observation that half of the people in the city of Los Angeles (in which the story is set) live every day on the verge of hysteria.  It is further noted that the other half ARE hysterical, and the predominant aspect of their lives is attempting to control their constant fear; fear generated entirely by the very nature of their environment, and just the way things ""are.""  It's a thought provoking concept of life in the `90s and beyond, and of a world in which babies are abandoned, people live in boxes on the street and the guy with the gun is in charge.  And as another character so succinctly points out, ""This isn't the way the world is supposed to work--""  All of which and more is considered by director Lawrence Kasdan in his evocative drama ""Grand Canyon,"" starring Danny Glover, Kevin Kline and Mary McDonnell.  It's a contemplation of the kind of world in which we are forced to live, the huge gaps and voids it creates in our lives, and the decisions and choices we make in an effort to fill the crevasses it all forms in our souls.  This is more than just a film, it's a statement; a reflection upon what it takes for millions of people from all walks of life to get out of bed every morning and face the day.  And for those who care enough and are bold enough to look deeply into Kasdan's eyes, there's a message to be found here, and a powerful one it is.In the song ""Johnny 99,"" Bruce Springsteen sings about a part of town where ""When you hit a red light you don't stop,"" and when Mack (Kline) leaves a Laker's game at the Forum and decides to try a short cut to avoid traffic, it is precisely in ""that"" part of town that his car gives up the ghost.  His cell phone is dead, but he manages to find a phone booth and call for road service.  But just as he gets back to his car, he becomes the target of a gang of armed young hoodlums out for an easy score or possibly more.  And when things are looking about as bad as they can for Mack, the tow truck arrives, and out steps a man named Simon (Glover), who thankfully knows a thing or two about negotiating with gang members; after all, this is his turf-- where he lives and makes his living.  Simon takes Mack out of harms way, and it is at that auspicious moment that a convergence of two heretofore divergent worlds occurs.Mack is an immigration lawyer who lives and works within the environs of the Miracle Mile; Simon is a part of the town in Springsteen's song.  Two individuals from different worlds whom fate brings together for a split second; and It's a moment that is destined to change both their lives forever, and like ripples issuing from a stone dropped into a pond, it is soon going to touch and make a difference in many other lives, as well.  Mack and Simon are about to learn a few things from one another, the most important of which may be found in Simon's perspective of the human race, and the significance of ""people"" when compared to one of Eternity's masterworks, the Grand Canyon.Lawrence Kasdan and Meg Kasdan wrote the screenplay for this film, from which Mr. Kasdan proceeds to deliver one of his finest cinematic offerings.  As previously stated, this is more than a film; it's a contemplation of who we are and what we have become as a species during our time upon this planet, and where it's all taken us.  And under Kasdan's steady guidance and insightful gaze, it is truly riveting drama that works especially well because there is something in it to which everyone will be able to identify or relate.  Certainly it will strike a deeper chord with those who live or have spent time in a large metropolitan area; the situations in this film will resonate much more for someone who has lived in L.A., as opposed to those born and raised in Independence, Oregon, for example.  But all will find a connection with the human issues Kasdan so incisively examines, because they are universal in nature.  Quite simply, Kasdan hits a perfect pitch here.  This is emotionally involving drama from beginning to end, aided in no small part by the mesmerizing score by Bill Conti and James Newton Howard that serves as a veritable pulse for the entire film.The outstanding ensemble cast matches Kasdan's excellence with a number of unforgettable performances, beginning with Kline and Glover.  Kline gives the kind of performance we've come to expect from him, which is to say convincing, believable and entirely credible.  He explores all of the nooks and crannies of his character and concisely expresses all that he finds there.  Glover, too, hits his stride perfectly, making Simon genuine and real by finding his character's center and effectively maintaining his focus on it.It is Mary McDonnell, however, who nearly steals the show with her portrayal of Claire, Mack's wife.  This is an extremely complex character, and McDonnell manages to thoroughly examine all of her myriad emotional levels and express them convincingly.  This is a woman at a most fragile time of her life, with the concerns of being a loving, devoted wife in conflict with her more maternal nature; coping with the sense of loss associated with the fact that her only child, Roberto (Jeremy Sisto) is fifteen and growing up too fast, and seeking to satisfy her need to nurture.  In Claire, McDonnell creates a woman with an absolute aura of beauty about her; it's a brilliant performance that is the very heart of the film.And finally, Steve Martin (Davis), Mary-Louise Parker (Dee) and Alfre Woodard (Jane) take ""Grand Canyon"" to the zenith of cinematic accomplishment.",5,An Insightful Commentary on Life from Lawrence Kasdan,1031702400,"09 11, 2002",2002,5592,"['Early',

310431,AMNNPDX9MFEUD,6302390478,Steve,"[3, 4]","Nearly twenty years after the fact, I caught Grand Canyon for the second time today. While I don't have as much distaste for it as I did back then, it still doesn't do much for me. As I often do, I read the positive reviews and the requisite negative comments to those who gave it one star to see if I missed something. It's always amusing to me how people chose the ridiculous and arrogant reply that someone ""doesn't get it"" if they happen to dislike a movie.  To that end, there is little to get about Grand Canyon. It certainly isn't subtle and neither is the smugness that runs throughout it. This is a rich white guy's movie version of Rodney King's plea for everyone to get along.The character of Mack, a Wonder Bread Angelino if there ever was one, stands at the center of this movie because he has an encounter that jolts him out of his mid-life ennui, but he spends so much time wrestling with his inner motives that I'm never quite sure he has really made the transformation. Comically enough, the producer played by Steve Martin is arguably the most honest of them all, although an argument can be made for Danny Glover's Simon, the moral center of the movie. Both of these characters see the folly in looking inward to the point of being blind to everything around you.Kevin Kline's Mack agonizes over his lost opportunity to pay it forward and then wrings his hands over the choices he makes to finally rectify this colossal life crisis. It's a grandiose and eager-to-a-fault premise that simply didn't work for me, possibly because Mack is a largely unlikable person. He cheats on his wife but then has a change of heart and simply wants to pretend nothing happened. The girl he fooled around with (played by Mary-Louise Parker) is suffering from heartbreak and the feeling of being used, exacerbated by the fact that Mack is her boss, yet Mack can't seem to understand why she wants to quit. Even though she tries to explain, the point is lost on him. Just how aware is this guy? He wants to save Simon (who clearly doesn't need saved at all) but can't see the problems with his secretary or even empathize with his wife's desire to adopt an abandoned baby. Mack wants to help but in a narcissistic way - he wants to clear his conscience and feel good about himself and seems oblivious to everyone around him. I'm never convinced his motives are greater than his own self-satisfaction.Mack is a weak person trying to make a difference in the world yet by-passing the most obvious places to start. In short, there is no need to have Parker's character in the movie at all because Kasdan choses to do nothing with her and, worse yet, make her seem unstable and pathetic. It's more important that angsty Mack fix up his newfound black friend with a date than address the far-more pressing issues staring him in the face. In the end, all's well that ends well and the credits roll as all the happy people stare in awe at the Grand Canyon.Grand Canyon is a lightweight social commentary that plays more like a feel-good movie than a powerful observation (e.g. ""Crash""). There are some decent scenes but it says very little in the final analysis. It's a movie that seems to not fully understand the tragic joke in Martin's comment that all of life's answers are found in the movies; as if Kasdan wants us to believe he's being ironic when in fact he was being serious.",2,"Oh, the irony, er, humanity",1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,3378,"['Nearly', 'twenty', 'years', 'fact', 'caught', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'second', 'time', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'distaste', 'did', 'back', 'then', 'still', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'often', 'do', 'read', 'positive', 'reviews', 'requisite', 'negative', 'comments', 'who', 'gave', 'one', 'star', 'see', 'missed', 'something', 'always', 'amusing', 'how', 'people', 'chose', 'ridiculous', 'arrogant', 'reply', 'someone', ""n't"", 'get', 'happen', 'dislike', 'movie', 'end', 'little', 'get', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'subtle', 'smugness', 'rich', 'white', 'guy', 'movie', 'version', 'Rodney', 'King', 'plea', 'everyone', 'get', 'along.The', 'character', 'Mack', 'Wonder', 'Bread', 'Angelino', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'center', 'movie', 'encounter', 'mid-life', 'ennui', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'wrestling', 'inner', 'motives', ""'m"", 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'really', 'made', 'transformation', 'Comically', 'enough', 'producer', 'played', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'arguably', 'most', 'honest', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Simon', 'moral', 'center', 'movie', 'characters', 'see', 'folly', 'looking', 'inward', 'point', 'being', 'blind', 'everything', 'around', 'you.Kevin', 'Kline', 'Mack', 'lost', 'opportunity', 'pay', 'forward', 'then', 'wrings', 'hands', 'choices', 'finally', 'rectify', 'colossal', 'life', 'crisis', 'grandiose', 'eager-to-a-fault', 'premise', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'possibly', 'Mack', 'largely', 'unlikable', 'person', 'wife', 'then', 'change', 'heart', 'simply', 'pretend', 'nothing', 'happened', 'girl', 'fooled', 'around', 'played', 'Mary-Louise', 'Parker', 'suffering', 'heartbreak', 'feeling', 'being', 'used', 'exacerbated', 'fact', 'Mack', 'boss', 'yet', 'Mack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'why', 'quit', 'Even', 'explain', 'point', 'lost', 'Just', 'how', 'aware', 'guy', 'save', 'Simon', 'who', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'need', 'saved', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'problems', 'secretary', 'even', 'empathize', 'wife', 'desire', 'adopt', 'abandoned', 'baby', 'Mack', 'help', 'narcissistic', 'way', 'clear', 'conscience', 'feel', 'good', 'oblivious', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'never', 'convinced', 'motives', 'are', 'greater', 'own', 'self-satisfaction.Mack', 'weak', 'person', 'trying', 'make', 'difference', 'world', 'yet', 'by-passing', 'most', 'obvious', 'places', 'start', 'short', 'need', 'have', 'Parker', 'character', 'movie', 'Kasdan', 'choses', 'do', 'nothing', 'worse', 'yet', 'make', 'seem', 'unstable', 'pathetic', 'more', 'important', 'angsty', 'Mack', 'fix', 'up', 'newfound', 'black', 'friend', 'date', 'far-more', 'pressing', 'issues', 'staring', 'face', 'end', 'well', 'well', 'credits', 'roll', 'happy', 'people', 'stare', 'awe', 'Grand', 'Canyon.Grand', 'Canyon', 'lightweight', 'social', 'commentary', 'more', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'powerful', 'observation', 'e.g', 'Crash', 'are', 'decent', 'scenes', 'very', 'little', 'final', 'analysis', 'movie', 'not', 'fully', 'understand', 'tragic', 'joke', 'Martin', 'comment', 'life', 'answers', 'are', 'found', 'movies', 'Kasdan', 'believe', 'being', 'ironic', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'being', 'serious']",N/A

I was interested to see what was written about the movie afterwards, so here I am.  I won't go into rehashing the plot of the movie; but would like to touch on one theme I feel is missing in most, if not all, reviews.What we do in our life affects others; our choices and turn of events within our life has something to do with the contact and interaction of those around us, along with life experiences.  Each person on the face of this earth contributes in some way, no matter how slightly, to shaping the lives of those they come in contact with, whether it be insignificantly or very involved.The Grand Canyon is a wonderful symbol of this theme.  We as a society are ever changing and evolving; there is erosion going on within our society (this seems to be obvious to all); however, for as different and separate we see each other, we are all part of something very large and beautiful, and that is what holds us all together.I recommend this movie to families, especially families with teens.  Discussion should follow afterwards about what each feels they got from this movie; and about how important each and every person is... we all matter.  We all have the responsibility to understand that what we do, no matter how insignificant we feel the action, affects life and people around us.",5,Thought Provoking Movie,1208131200,"04 14, 2008",2008,1359,"['watched', 'movie', 'reading', 'reviews', 'beforehand', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'written', 'movie', 'afterwards', 'here', 'am', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'rehashing', 'plot', 'movie', 'would', 'like', 'touch', 'one', 'theme', 'feel', 'missing', 'most', 'not', 'reviews.What', 'do', 'life', 'others', 'choices', 'turn', 'events', 'life', 'something', 'do', 'contact', 'interaction', 'life', 'experiences', 'person', 'face', 'earth', 'way', 'matter', 'how', 'slightly', 'shaping', 'lives', 'come', 'contact', 'be', 'insignificantly', 'very', 'involved.The', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'wonderful', 'symbol', 'theme', 'society', 'are', 'ever', 'changing', 'evolving', 'erosion', 'going', 'society', 'be', 'obvious', 'however', 'different', 'separate', 'see', 'other', 'are', 'part', 'something', 'very', 'large', 'beautiful', 'what', 'together.I', 'recommend', 'movie', 'families', 'especially', 'families', 'teens', 'Discussion', 'should', 'follow', 'afterwards', 'what', 'feels', 'got', 'movie', 'how', 'important', 'person', 'matter', 'have', 'responsibility', 'understand', 'what', 'do', 'matter', 'how', 'insignificant', 'feel', 'action', 'life', 'people']",N/A
310434,A3JLKDUV0B6O5U,6302390478,TFR,"[8, 14]","I saw this film at a local cineplex when it was first released and since then, I've revisited ""Grand Canyon"" at least a dozen times.  Here are a ten observations:1.  This film's theatrical release took place around the time that the Rodney King trial was getting underway, and the ensuing LA riots would take place some months later.  It's interesting how the underlying theme of ""Grand Canyon"" preceeded the ""Can't we all just get along,"" thrust of King's later remark to the news media in the wake of the riots.2.  Kevin Kline does a good job of portraying an immigration lawyer who is having an affair with his secretary; Danny Glover and Mary McDonnell are okay in portraying a tow truck driver and a modern LA mom, respectively; and probably because he had nothing to do with the producing, directing or writing involved in this film, his role in ""Grand Canyon"" happens to be one of Steve Martin's better performances.3.  The only special effects in this movie are in a dream sequence of Kevin Kline flying through the night air in metropolitan Los Angeles.  Otherwise, there are no car explosions, flying monkeys, no interglactic arks transporting shipments of minerals through deep space, no aliens blowing holes through buildings, and no Whoopie Goldberg.4.  One element missing in the movie is humor.  Aside from Glover's remark that the Kline character may not know many black people, there really isn't much to laugh or even smile about; this lack of humor alone seems to make the characters less human and more like puppets in some morality play about undesirable behavior and human nature that plods along slowly, but methodically.5.  Everything got thrown into this movie except the kitchen sink.  I suppose the whole concept of all these significant events (a rescue from would-be muggers in a bad part of LA, finding an abandoned baby, being shot by a gunman at close range, etc.) happening all at once may have looked good on paper, but in transition to film, I found myself thinking how implausible such an unrelated chain of events happening to a few people within a few hours would be.6.  The thought that everyone should get together and that miracles really can happen are fine sentiments, but halfway through ""Grand Canyon,"" I was wondering what Kadsan was going to throw in for a Grand Finale:  The Kline Character discovers a body buried in his backyard?  The Glover character dies in a bar fight?  The Mary McDonnell character turns lesbo?  Kenny Rogers buys vast tracts of Brentwood in order to build an amusement park/dude ranch?7.  At the very end of the film, everybody piles in a van and they all drive to the Grand Canyon, where they gaze in dumbfoundedness at this awesome natural wonder.  I guess if this movie had been written by Callie Khouri (Thelma and Louise) Kevin Kline would have driven the van off a cliff...  I guess Kasdan must have decided against this sort of ending because he couldn't find enough room to put Ridley Scott in the van.8.  Probably because the white Ford Bronco didn't even exist at that time, no mention is ever made of O.J. Simpson.  At the time this film was being developed, O.J. was still being filmed running through airports with old ladies and business suits cheering him on.  Clearly, I was disappointed that some featurette including vignettes of O.J.'s struggles wasn't included on the dvd, because witnessing the O.J. trial was a lot like experiencing a vast cultural divide for us working stiffs.9.  On the dvd that I bought, you have to fast-forward through all of this crap to get to the main menu.  I hope someday that the idiots who direct the manufacturing of these things realize how much they are pissing people off by doing this.10.  Despite many of the above observations, the dvd film version of ""Grand Canyon"" is excellent.  ""Grand Canyon"" has a lot going for it, or else I wouldn't have given it five stars.  Great Cinematography.  Great Soundtrack.  Excellent casting.  I certainly enjoyed it, even though the actual story line was slightly weak.",5,Well worth watching more than once...,1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,4035,"['saw', 'film', 'local', 'cineplex', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'then', ""'ve"", 'revisited', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'least', 'dozen', 'times', 'Here', 'are', 'ten', 'observations:1', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'took', 'place', 'time', 'Rodney', 'King', 'trial', 'was', 'getting', 'underway', 'ensuing', 'LA', 'riots', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'months', 'later', 'interesting', 'how', 'underlying', 'theme', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'preceeded', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'along', 'thrust', 'King', 'later', 'remark', 'news', 'media', 'wake', 'riots.2', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'immigration', 'lawyer', 'who', 'having', 'affair', 'secretary', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'are', 'okay', 'portraying', 'tow', 'truck', 'driver', 'modern', 'LA', 'mom', 'respectively', 'probably', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'producing', 'directing', 'writing', 'involved', 'film', 'role', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'be', 'one', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'better', 'performances.3', 'only', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'dream', 'sequence', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'flying', 'night', 'air', 'metropolitan', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Otherwise', 'are', 'car', 'explosions', 'flying', 'monkeys', 'interglactic', 'arks', 'transporting', 'shipments', 'minerals', 'deep', 'space', 'aliens', 'blowing', 'holes', 'buildings', 'Whoopie', 'Goldberg.4', 'One', 'element', 'missing', 'movie', 'humor', 'Aside', 'Glover', 'remark', 'Kline', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'many', 'black', 'people', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'laugh', 'even', 'smile', 'lack', 'humor', 'alone', 'make', 'characters', 'human', 'more', 'like', 'puppets', 'morality', 'play', 'undesirable', 'behavior', 'human', 'nature', 'plods', 'slowly', 'methodically.5', 'Everything', 'got', 'thrown', 'movie', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'suppose', 'whole', 'concept', 'significant', 'events', 'rescue', 'would-be', 'muggers', 'bad', 'part', 'LA', 'finding', 'abandoned', 'baby', 'being', 'shot', 'gunman', 'close', 'range', 'etc', 'happening', 'once', 'may', 'have', 'looked', 'good', 'paper', 'transition', 'film', 'found', 'thinking', 'how', 'implausible', 'such', 'unrelated', 'chain', 'events', 'happening', 'few', 'people', 'few', 'hours', 'would', 'be.6', 'thought', 'everyone', 'should', 'get', 'together', 'miracles', 'really', 'can', 'happen', 'are', 'fine', 'sentiments', 'halfway', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'was', 'wondering', 'what', 'Kadsan', 'was', 'going', 'throw', 'Grand', 'Finale', 'Kline', 'Character', 'body', 'buried', 'backyard', 'Glover', 'character', 'dies', 'bar', 'fight', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'character', 'lesbo', 'Kenny', 'Rogers', 'buys', 'vast', 'tracts', 'Brentwood', 'order', 'build', 'amusement', 'park/dude', 'ranch', '7', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'everybody', 'piles', 'van', 'drive', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'where', 'gaze', 'dumbfoundedness', 'awesome', 'natural', 'wonder', 'guess', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'written', 'Callie', 'Khouri', 'Thelma', 'Louise', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'van', 'cliff', 'guess', 'Kasdan', 'must', 'have', 'decided', 'sort', 'ending', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'enough', 'room', 'put', 'Ridley', 'Scott', 'van.8', 'Probably', 'white', 'Ford', 'Bronco', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'exist', 'time', 'mention', 'ever', 'made', 'O.J', 'Simpson', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'being', 'developed', 'O.J', 'was', 'still', 'being', 'filmed', 'running', 'airports', 'old', 'ladies', 'business', 'suits', 'cheering', 'Clearly', 'was', 'disappointed', 'featurette', 'including', 'vignettes', 'O.J', 'struggles', 'was', ""n't"", 'included', 'dvd', 'witnessing', 'O.J', 'trial', 'was', 'lot', 'experiencing', 'vast', 'cultural', 'divide', 'working', 'stiffs.9', 'dvd', 'bought', 'have', 'fast-forward', 'crap', 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'hope', 'someday', 'idiots', 'who', 'direct', 'manufacturing', 'things', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'are', 'pissing', 'people', 'doing', 'this.10', 'many', 'above', 'observations', 'dvd', 'film', 'version', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'excellent', 'Grand', 'Canyon', 'lot', 'going', 'else', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'Great', 'Cinematography', 'Great', 'Soundtrack', 'Excellent', 'casting', 'certainly', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'actual', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'slightly', 'weak']",N/A

310437,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6302390478,Wuchak,"[10, 12]","""Grand Canyon"" (1991) is essentially about the 'grand canyon' that exists between the races and the haves & have-nots in America. It starts out powerfully with middle-aged lawyer Kevin Kline taking an unwise detour in L.A. and breaking down on the bad side of town; the situation turns threatening when a group of thugs harass him, but a tow truck driver comes to his aid (Danny Glover). Thus begins a relationship that positively impacts both of their lives and the lives of those connected to them.One subplot involves Kline's love/lust for women (like any red-blooded male). He and his wife (Mary McDonnell) are experiencing the empty nest syndrome; he naturally veers toward an affair at work. There's an early scene where the potential ""other woman"" (Mary-Louise Parker) comes into his office at work and puts her hand on his. It's a simple yet potent scene. Is it wrong for Kline to have feelings for this woman? And, if so, should he risk destroying his marriage by pursuing a more intimate relationship? And, if he does commit adultery, can he still change his mind before it's too late? Will he?That's just one subplot amongst many. Some reviewers feel there are TOO many stories going on. I suggest they stick to lighter fare, like maybe ""RV"" (giggle).Anyway, some themes explored include:- Miraculous life-saving encounters.- White/black relations.- The rich/working class/poor divide.- Homelessness.- Why do kids join gangs/become hoodlums?- The challenges of a 20-year nigh romance-less marriage.- The drive to improve one's living standards.- Does violence in film escalate violence or is it simply a reflection of society? Does a filmmaker have a moral responsibility to society?- Life-changing experiences that aren't so life-changing after all.- How many split seconds do you have to make a left turn in downtown traffic?- What do you do after miraculously finding/saving an infant?- Divine intervention.- Matchmaking, blind dates and finding Mr. or Ms. ""right.""- The ripple-effect each person's actions have on others, revealing humanity's significance, which is contrasted by the idea that humanity is inconsequential compared to the Earth & universe's timeless marvels, like the Grand Canyon itself.The picture obviously bites off a lot, but is well able to chew it. It bespeaks of real life and doesn't come off contrived at all. Take for example the teenager's driving lesson: He makes a serious mistake and then pulls over. After his father explains a few things he attempts to start the vehicle which is ALREADY running. We've all done that. Another example would be Steve Martin's beautiful redhead girlfriend Vanessa (Sarah Trigger): She's calm, happy and pleasant one moment but then suddenly starts crying (obviously provoked by a statement). A rambling and uncomfortable emotional rant ensues. It's real. Another example would be McDonnell's reaction when her son asks if she and Kline are getting a divorce. Completely shocked, she asks, ""Why would you ask that?! Do we seem like a couple on the verge of divorce?"" She KNOWS that her son wouldn't ask such a question unless he sensed there were problems in the marriage on some instinctual level. These are just three minor examples off the top of my head.I've heard some complain that there's no humor. Did we see the same movie? There's actually quite a bit of humor or, at least, amusing and light-hearted moments. (How could there not be with Steve Martin in the cast?). Even though the picture is essentially a serious drama I busted out laughing, snickering or smiling on quite a few occasions. The film delivers in this department. Plus it's realistic humor, not contrived.Scanning through the reviews you'll note that ""Grand Canyon"" is a love it or hate it piece. I love it. The acting is, for the most part, great and you really come to care for the characters; you care about the outcome of each of the story lines. One reviewer commented that ""Grand Canyon"" is a depressing film; he couldn't be more wrong. Yes, there are some disconcerting story elements, but watch it till the end! Other reviewers criticize Steve Martin, who has a beard and plays a filmmaker. These people need to get a life; Martin was perfect for the role.A couple things I appreciate about ""Grand Canyon"" is that it respects the intelligence of the viewer; it's not dumbed-down, nor is everything spelled out. Some things you simply have to read in-between-the-lines, others are left to the imagination. It also provokes you to ponder the numerous issues it addresses for DAYS afterward. Few movies have this effect. In fact, there's so much to ""Grand Canyon"" that you'll get something new from the picture with each viewing.Oh, about the New York Times critic that lambasted ""Grand Canyon"" as the worst movie ever made (Why sure!): First of all, who cares what some moron at the NY Times says? The very fact that he writes for The Times tells you that his artistic judgment shouldn't be taken too seriously.Also, most critics hailed 2004's ""Crash"" as a masterpiece but it obviously borrowed much from ""Grand Canyon."" The difference is that the latter is the better film. Although ""Crash"" has its merits ""Grand Canyon"" is more entertaining and has a more positive vibe.FINAL WORD: ""Grand Canyon"" is a film of the most eminent order; a masterpiece.GRADE:
