I adore this show.In my humble opinion, Sarah Silverman is freaking hilarious. What she says is funny, but it's *how* she says it - subtle inflections and mannerisms - that makes her extraordinarily funny.And if you think that she is spewing vulgarities and bigotry just to get a few shock-giggles, you aren't paying enough attention. She is more morally-serious than you probably realize. She does these things to magnify absurdity--to make them ironic and dumb.And Brian and Steve... oh my, what a pair. Other than Troy and Abed on _Community_, I haven't seen a better dynamic between two characters.You won't find many (any?) shows as hilarious, conceptually interesting, and risky.

I just saw the episode where a ghost haunts the 2 guys with a remote control, and Sarah thinks she's a man (this awful song ""Penis In My Mind"" or something?) and I don't think I laughed out loud even ONCE in 22 minutes.  I can't understand why anyone would think this ho-hum dreck is funny?  There's no jokes in it!  Just weird dialog and random bizarre events.  I found Sarah Silverman hilarious on all the Comedy Central roasts, so I just don't understand why her TV show was so painfully unfunny and puzzlingly uncomfortable to watch?

Now, we don't know what bonus features are included, so the 5 stars is just for the content of the actual episodes.It has a unique cast of 5 oddball characters, and it's not like anything I'VE ever seen before. If there was such a thing as an indie TV show, this is it! Very low budget per episode (it was cut each season, if I remember correctly.) It's hard to find shows that put every dollar correctly to heart like this one. I highly recommend this show to anyone with a unique sense of humor. It's not only slapstick; it's thought provoking slapstick!...(as thought provoking as a comedy series can be).Thankfully the show got some recognition in its short run. Sarah Silverman was nominated for best actress in a comedy series at the Emmy awards, and Dan Sterling was nominated for outstanding writing at the Writers Guild awards. Not much, but both well deserved.Special Features:A Conversation With The Writers And ProducersDigital And Animated ShortsBehind-The-Scenes VideosAudio Commentaries With Cast And CrewThe Cast And Creators At 2007's Comic-ConThe Original PilotAudition VideosUpdate: Got the set the other day. I have to say, it's a pretty solid set. But as a warning DO NOT buy this set if you already own Season 1-Season 2 Vol. 2. Because it contains the same DVDs previously released with the added Season 3 (that canNOT be bought on it's own). But all of the original bonus features are available for viewing, with added content in the season 3 DVDs. It comes in a semi-flimsy orange box to hold the 3 DVD cases together, but it's still worth the buy... If you didn't already purchase the previous releases.",5,"3 seasons, 32 Episodes.

It had a crazy setup with her character believing she was barely capable of taking care of herself at best, usually relying on her sister and friends to help and guide her towards being a competent adult. If it had a flaw and some may consider it a plus, the show sometimes went a bit too far towards gross, or at least objectionable activities and humor.  But there was no denying they did it with humor and wit, unlike other shows and movies which seem to forget the witty side of such dark humor that can give it balance.Oddly she was probably wiser and smarter than any of them!  She saw the world through usually innocent eyes yet savored the gross dark and dumber gifts life offered more often than not.
