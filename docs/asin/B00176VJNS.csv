1155923,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B00176VJNS,Bill Smith,"[10, 20]","I have had the 45th Anniversary Laserdisc version of this film for years. I was interested in this film not because of John Wayne, but for one reason only---Gail Russell. Wow, what a knockout she was. Eyes that just melt you in your tracks. Gail has to be one of the most underrated and unsung movie star beauties of that era. She is absolutely captivating in films like this, Wake of the Red Witch, and Seven Men From Now, the Boetticher-Randolph western classic. What a tragic life she led though. She turned to alcohol early in her career due to stagefright and confidence issues, and literally and tragically drank herself to her death in 1961 at the young age of 36. This film was shot when she was at the peak of her gorgeous beauty, about 22. Its obvious Wayne had an affinity for her(there were rumors of a relationship) as he used her in starring roles in 2 films and then recommended her to Boetticher for her 'comeback' film in 1956, the above mentioned Seven Men From Now, where she steals the screen every time she is on it. I don't know that a Blu Ray will significantly improve the great black and white transfer of this film on that 45th anniversary laserdisc, but I will probably give it a shot to see how ravishing she looks in hi def. Those eyes!add--and yes, contrary to what some commenter says, Wayne did recommend Gail Russell for the role in Seven Men From Now.

1155925,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,B00176VJNS,Bobby Underwood,"[6, 7]","Wayne proved you could make an excellent western without a big budget in his company's first effort. While it has somehow garnered a reputation as second-tier Wayne over the years, mostly due to surviving prints of the film being just okay, this is actually a very entertaining film with a great cast and good story. Having seen it several times quite recently, it has that special quality of being watchable over and over.Much of the reason is the lovely Gail Russell. She was most certainly the prettiest girl in Hollywood and it's no wonder that Wayne fell in love with her. She was terribly shy in real life, and truly had to will herself to step in front of the camera. But the camera loved her and so did audiences. Angel and the Badman, The Unseen, and The Uninvited are probably her best moments on film. Her Penelope, the lovely young Quaker girl who prompts gunslinger Quirt Evans to give up his guns, is one of her best remembered roles.Quirt (Wayne) has been wounded by his nemesis on the outlaw trail, Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot), and his gang is hot on his trail when Penelope and her father (John Halloran) rescue him during the chase. Bystanders are stunned when the Quaker family takes Quirt into their home to mend, knowing his reputation with a gun can only bring disaster for them. But from the moment they begin calling him Brother, much to his chagrin, they only see the good in Quirt and it begins to wear him down.Or perhaps it's the big dark eyes of Penelope, and her ethereal beauty and faith in Quirt which causes him to gradually change. There is a bit too much talk at times, but it is balanced by a saloon brawl and some cattle rustling. It is the romance between Quirt and Penelope which is the heart and soul of things, however. Harry Carey gives a great supporting performance as Marshall Wistful McClintock, at first hanging around to see if Laredo will take out Quirt or Quirt will take out Laredo, then to see if Penelope can really change Quirt and make him lay down his gun.Anyone could guess the outcome but it is very entertaining getting there. Wayne and Russell made a nice couple and there is a charm to their romance missing in some of Wayne's bigger budget westerns of the era. A very enjoyable movie for a Saturday morning in bed and a nice way to remember Gail Russell.",5,Remembering the Lovely Gail Russell,1225584000,"11 2, 2008",2008,2317,"['Wayne', 'proved', 'could', 'make', 'excellent', 'western', 'big', 'budget', 'company', 'first', 'effort', 'somehow', 'garnered', 'reputation', 'second-tier', 'Wayne', 'years', 'mostly', 'due', 'surviving', 'prints', 'film', 'being', 'just', 'okay', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'film', 'great', 'cast', 'good', 'story', 'Having', 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'quite', 'recently', 'special', 'quality', 'being', 'watchable', 'over.Much', 'reason', 'lovely', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'was', 'most', 'certainly', 'prettiest', 'girl', 'Hollywood', 'wonder', 'Wayne', 'fell', 'love', 'was', 'terribly', 'shy', 'real', 'life', 'truly', 'had', 'will', 'herself', 'step', 'front', 'camera', 'camera', 'loved', 'so', 'did', 'audiences', 'Angel', 'Badman', 'Unseen', 'Uninvited', 'are', 'probably', 'best', 'moments', 'film', 'Her', 'Penelope', 'lovely', 'young', 'Quaker', 'girl', 'who', 'gunslinger', 'Quirt', 'Evans', 'give', 'up', 'guns', 'one', 'best', 'remembered', 'roles.Quirt', 'Wayne', 'been', 'wounded', 'nemesis', 'outlaw', 'trail', 'Laredo', 'Stevens', 'Bruce', 'Cabot', 'gang', 'hot', 'trail', 'when', 'Penelope', 'father', 'John', 'Halloran', 'rescue', 'chase', 'Bystanders', 'are', 'stunned', 'when', 'Quaker', 'family', 'Quirt', 'home', 'mend', 'knowing', 'reputation', 'gun', 'can', 'only', 'bring', 'disaster', 'moment', 'begin', 'calling', 'Brother', 'much', 'chagrin', 'only', 'see', 'good', 'Quirt', 'wear', 'down.Or', 'perhaps', 'big', 'dark', 'eyes', 'Penelope', 'ethereal', 'beauty', 'faith', 'Quirt', 'gradually', 'change', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'talk', 'times', 'balanced', 'saloon', 'brawl', 'cattle', 'rustling', 'romance', 'Quirt', 'Penelope', 'heart', 'soul', 'things', 'however', 'Harry', 'Carey', 'great', 'supporting', 'performance', 'Marshall', 'Wistful', 'McClintock', 'first', 'hanging', 'around', 'see', 'Laredo', 'will', 'take', 'out', 'Quirt', 'Quirt', 'will', 'take', 'out', 'Laredo', 'then', 'see', 'Penelope', 'can', 'really', 'change', 'Quirt', 'make', 'lay', 'down', 'gun.Anyone', 'could', 'guess', 'outcome', 'very', 'entertaining', 'getting', 'there', 'Wayne', 'Russell', 'made', 'nice', 'couple', 'charm', 'romance', 'missing', 'Wayne', 'bigger', 'budget', 'westerns', 'era', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'bed', 'nice', 'way', 'remember', 'Gail', 'Russell']",N/A

1155928,A3M5UGU0NGD38D,B00176VJNS,Casey62,"[14, 16]","ANGEL AND THE BADMAN (Republic, 1947), was John Wayne's first film as producer in which he plays a gunfighter out to avenge the murder of his foster father, and is reformed through the love of a Quaker girl, played by lovely Gail Russell. Not only is this one of Wayne's most popular films, it also happens to be one of the best examples of the genre employing all the classic ingredients but in an unconventional context.Written and directed with sensitivity by James Edward Grant, ANGEL AND THE BADMAN has an unusual mix of gentleness and exciting action, set against the magnificent backdrop of Sedona, Arizona. Wayne and Russell have a wonderful onscreen chemistry between them, and project a simple, genuine honesty in their romantic scenes. Veteran character actor Harry Carey plays the sheriff hot on Wayne's trail who's determined to bring him in, and movie bad guy Bruce Cabot is good as the card cheat who killed Wayne's stepfather.A staple in the public domain circuit, ANGEL AND THE BADMAN has been available for years on VHS and DVD in sub-standard quality transfers that were either dark and murky or soft and faded. Finally, the beauty of this film can be properly appreciated in Olive Films' new Blu-ray release that does full justice to Archie J. Stout's crisp black and white cinematography. The soundtrack, while clear, has slight fluttering in a few scenes, but it's not distracting. The disc has chapter stops, and there are no extra features.
