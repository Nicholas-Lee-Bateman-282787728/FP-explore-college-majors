1639090,A1EBOEB2DXOMIK,B00BUBE2N4,"Amazon Customer ""C. Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Yoonhee is a Korean writer who hasn&#8217;t had a book published in three years.  Her editor is threatening that if she doesn&#8217;t turn in something soon, she&#8217;ll have to pay back the advance she received.  So she is seeking new material when an old friend, Seo-Yeon, tells her of a Vietnamese curse.  Muoi was a woman who lived 100 years ago who fell in love with a painter, but he turned his back on her and she was disfigured by the man&#8217;s fiancee.  A curse was born but Muoi&#8217;s vengeful spirit was eventually trapped inside her portrait.Yoonhee travels to Vietnam so Seo-Yeon can take her to the historical locations in the story of Muoi, but soon after arriving, Yoonhee begins to experience strange sights and sounds, and she&#8217;s beginning to suspect the curse of Muoi is not only real, but has been unleashed on her.This isn&#8217;t helped by the fact that, in her last book, &#8220;Secrets and Lies&#8221;, she wrote a fictionalized account of her friend, Seo-Yeon, and didn&#8217;t paint the woman in a very positive light at all.MUOI: The Legend of a Portrait is a pretty suspenseful movie.  Written by Zizak and writer/director Tae-keyong Kim, MUOI is a movie that takes its time in getting where it&#8217;s going, but somehow manages to SEEM as if it&#8217;s already there a lot sooner than it is.  Yoonhee experiences ghost activity on her first night in Vietnam when she and Seo-Yeon are in their hotel room.  At first this seems important, then later it doesn&#8217;t and you question the writer&#8217;s and director&#8217;s choice for including it.  But in the end, maybe it WAS important.  Maybe it was a sign of things to come.  Maybe there&#8217;s deeper meaning there.  Whatever the answer, nothing seems wasted in these 93 minutes.An Jo as Yoonhee and Ya-ryeon Cha as Seo-Yeon give excellent performances as the childhood friends who are now trying to keep secrets from each other while pretending that everything is as it&#8217;s always been with them.  Yoonhee&#8217;s alienation at a wine party with Seo-Yeon and her friends, with everyone speaking Vietnamese, except Yoonhee who doesn&#8217;t speak the language, is clear as day with just a look from An Jo, while Ya-ryeon Cha&#8217;s character knows what she&#8217;s doing to her old friend, but smiles through it and pretends like there&#8217;s nothing wrong.  These were very nuanced performances and they added a whole other level to the plot.MUOI is a beautifully shot movie that is able to tell a story with the camera even when there&#8217;s no dialogue.Now, as a horror movie, it&#8217;s not the most frightening thing I&#8217;ve ever seen, but there were some very intense moments and some excellent camera work with the ghosts.

To be honest, I was rather surprised... It was a fun little horror flick... not overly predictable. And the endings were great! By that I mean endings of certain characters. The multiple-character ending was wonderful. I kept thinking it was over, and yet another delightful death! Not 5-stars, but definitely worth the watch.

1639093,AEWAJRKEL38X9,B00BUBE2N4,"LM ""You are entitled to your INFORMED opinion...","[3, 4]","I think this movie had great potential, but it got too bogged down in attempting to have the viewer guess at everything.  The problem, at least for me, is that I guessed it all so early on.  There was no real build-up for me be because I knew where it was headed and by who.  There was little for me to wonder about and puzzle together.  Now, if someone has not seen similar movies before, then likely they would find it quite entertaining and a good mystery.The story of Muoi and her curse is very good, touching, and frightening in itself, but this film did not make full use of that, in my opinion.  I felt that the film-makers wanted to blend the past and the present and the people of the past and the present all together with the curse, but I was unable to care about any of the characters, especially in the present.I love films that have subtle touches, and ""Muoi"" has those in abundance.  It was pretty well filmed and well acted, but the script left no room for real suspense.  Again, that is my personal opinion.Overall, I don't think I would watch this movie again, but I would recommend it to others because I'm sure that many people would find this film creepy and clever.  While I found it to have its moments, they were just to few and far between for me because I found it so predictable.I wish I could give ""Muoi"" 2 1/2 stars because I did not dislike it, but I don't want to give it 3 stars because I didn't find it very satisfying.",2,It had potential,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",2013,1452,"['think', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'got', 'too', 'bogged', 'down', 'attempting', 'have', 'viewer', 'guess', 'everything', 'problem', 'least', 'guessed', 'so', 'early', 'was', 'real', 'build-up', 'be', 'knew', 'where', 'was', 'headed', 'who', 'was', 'little', 'wonder', 'puzzle', 'together', 'Now', 'someone', 'not', 'seen', 'similar', 'movies', 'then', 'likely', 'would', 'find', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'good', 'mystery.The', 'story', 'Muoi', 'curse', 'very', 'good', 'touching', 'frightening', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'full', 'use', 'opinion', 'felt', 'film-makers', 'wanted', 'blend', 'past', 'present', 'people', 'past', 'present', 'together', 'curse', 'was', 'unable', 'care', 'characters', 'especially', 'present.I', 'love', 'films', 'have', 'subtle', 'touches', 'Muoi', 'abundance', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'filmed', 'well', 'acted', 'script', 'left', 'room', 'real', 'suspense', 'Again', 'personal', 'opinion.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'would', 'recommend', 'others', ""'m"", 'sure', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'find', 'film', 'creepy', 'clever', 'found', 'have', 'moments', 'were', 'just', 'few', 'far', 'found', 'so', 'predictable.I', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'Muoi', '2', '1/2', 'stars', 'did', 'not', 'dislike', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'very', 'satisfying']",Muoi: The Legend of the Portrait

1639095,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00BUBE2N4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Muoi: The Legend of a Portrait (Tae-yong Kim, 2007)I swear up, down, and sideways that I first watched Muoi: The Legend of a Portrait when I was hospitalized almost a year ago. A couple of days later when I was updating the list, I looked at the poster and synopsis and realized I didn't remember a blessed thing about the movie, so I removed it. I got round to watching it last night, and that was a good decision; if I did watch it, I didn't remember a single thing about it. I also distinctly remembered giving it three stars (which makes me think I may, in my dilaudid-fueled hospital haze, have been mixing it up with Gidam, which did get three stars, and which I watched on January 15th, a week before leaving the hospital); this watch puts it much closer to Ryeong, the other Tae-yong Kim movie I've seen (Ryeong was his first, Muoi, three years later, his second).Considered (according to Wikipedia) the first post-Saigon Vietnamese horror film (while Tae-yong Kim is Korean, most of the film was shot on location in Vietnam), Muoi concerns the trials and travails of Yoon-hee (My Little Hero's An Jo), a Korean author suffering from writer's block. (Is there any author ever portrayed in a movie who isn't?) Her last book, a semi-autobiographical tale called Secrets and Lies, lost her most of her friends, but once day she gets a call from Seo-yeon (Voice's Ye-Ryeon Cha), who it turns out has been living in Vietnam for some years now, and so may not have read the book. She floats the idea of Yoon-hee coming to stay with her for a while and, upon hearing of Yoon-hee's problems, mentions the story of Muoi, a Vietnamese ghost whose tale is just begging to be told. Yoon-hee heads off to Vietnam, the two of them hook up, and Yoon-hee gets down to researching&#8212;but she soon discovers that most everyone she talks to is reluctant to give her any information, fearing they will bring the wrath of Muoi down upon themselves. This is not helping her writer's block any. Neither are those strange noises, nor the things she keeps just almost seeing out of the corner of her eye...I wouldn't necessarily call Muoi a bad movie, but I would certainly go far enough as to say it's mediocre in the worst way. Everything about it is competently done; it is well-acted, decently-directed, with cinematography and lighting teams who are experienced and good at their jobs, the soundtrack is effective if generic, etc., etc. Thus we get to the real sin of omission: if you had assembled a team this good to make a movie, why didn't you even try to do something with even a single facet of originality? This is completely faceless work, just another horror movie that looks and feels like hundreds of other movies like it. If that's what you're looking for, Muoi is certain to take the edge off...but that's all it will do.  **",2,Movie: The Legend of an Original Southeast Asian Horror Flick,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,2829,"['Muoi', 'Legend', 'Portrait', 'Tae-yong', 'Kim', '2007', 'swear', 'up', 'down', 'first', 'watched', 'Muoi', 'Legend', 'Portrait', 'when', 'was', 'hospitalized', 'almost', 'year', 'ago', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'when', 'was', 'updating', 'list', 'looked', 'poster', 'synopsis', 'realized', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'blessed', 'thing', 'movie', 'removed', 'got', 'round', 'watching', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'good', 'decision', 'did', 'watch', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'single', 'thing', 'also', 'distinctly', 'remembered', 'giving', 'three', 'stars', 'think', 'may', 'dilaudid-fueled', 'hospital', 'haze', 'have', 'been', 'mixing', 'up', 'Gidam', 'did', 'get', 'three', 'stars', 'watched', 'January', '15th', 'week', 'leaving', 'hospital', 'watch', 'much', 'closer', 'Ryeong', 'other', 'Tae-yong', 'Kim', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Ryeong', 'was', 'first', 'Muoi', 'three', 'years', 'later', 'second', '.Considered', 'according', 'Wikipedia', 'first', 'post-Saigon', 'Vietnamese', 'horror', 'film', 'Tae-yong', 'Kim', 'Korean', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Vietnam', 'Muoi', 'trials', 'travails', 'Yoon-hee', 'My', 'Little', 'Hero', 'Jo', 'Korean', 'author', 'suffering', 'writer', 'block', 'there', 'author', 'ever', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'who', ""n't"", 'last', 'book', 'semi-autobiographical', 'tale', 'called', 'Secrets', 'Lies', 'lost', 'most', 'friends', 'once', 'day', 'call', 'Seo-yeon', 'Voice', 'Ye-Ryeon', 'Cha', 'who', 'out', 'been', 'living', 'Vietnam', 'years', 'now', 'so', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'floats', 'idea', 'Yoon-hee', 'coming', 'stay', 'while', 'hearing', 'Yoon-hee', 'problems', 'mentions', 'story', 'Muoi', 'Vietnamese', 'ghost', 'tale', 'just', 'begging', 'be', 'told', 'Yoon-hee', 'heads', 'Vietnam', 'two', 'hook', 'up', 'Yoon-hee', 'down', 'researching', '8212', 'soon', 'discovers', 'most', 'everyone', 'reluctant', 'give', 'information', 'fearing', 'will', 'bring', 'wrath', 'Muoi', 'down', 'upon', 'not', 'helping', 'writer', 'block', 'are', 'strange', 'noises', 'things', 'just', 'almost', 'seeing', 'corner', 'eye', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'call', 'Muoi', 'bad', 'movie', 'would', 'certainly', 'go', 'far', 'enough', 'say', 'mediocre', 'worst', 'way', 'Everything', 'competently', 'done', 'well-acted', 'decently-directed', 'cinematography', 'lighting', 'teams', 'who', 'are', 'experienced', 'good', 'jobs', 'soundtrack', 'effective', 'generic', 'etc.', 'etc', 'Thus', 'get', 'real', 'sin', 'omission', 'had', 'assembled', 'team', 'good', 'make', 'movie', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'do', 'something', 'even', 'single', 'facet', 'originality', 'completely', 'faceless', 'work', 'just', 'horror', 'movie', 'feels', 'hundreds', 'other', 'movies', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Muoi', 'certain', 'take', 'edge', 'will', 'do', '**']",Muoi: The Legend of the Portrait
