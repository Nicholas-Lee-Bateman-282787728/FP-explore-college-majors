287699,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,6301978420,AbeStreet,"[4, 7]","(...) this is a cute romantic mystery. Nick & Nora Charles broke new ground with their love bickering. The film is a nice break from the more typical hardboiled detectives of the 20's, 30's and 40's.I think Nora (Myrna Loy) was at her best in this film. She is beautiful. Her cute nose, which as she aged grew less and less cute, and short dark hair came off as very sexy. This is the only film in which her desire to see Nick work as a detective came off as genuine. In the later films it seemed to be a little to scripted. I think my favorite scene is when Joe Morelli broke into Nick and Nora's bedroom. In order to keep Nora from getting shot Nick punches Nora in the jaw to knock her out of the line of fire. As a married man I can tell you Nick got to do what most men wish they could do at some point in time. (jk). Nora takes it like a champ. Instead being upset at Nick she's upset that she missed the action while she was dazed on the floor.While not my favorite THIN MAN movie overall I do think it has the best romantic sparring between Nick and Nora. The plot is pretty good and the story moves at a good pace. If you're not familiar with that many 1930's films you'll get a kick out of the 30's lingo, especially some of the womens lingo, in the film. I don't know if recreational drinking was ever as carefree as it is with Nick but it doesn't come off as hokey and is quite funny.The best thing about the film is the relationship between Nick and Nora. I wish there were more directors like Van Dyke around today. He, without lengthy dialogue scenes, was able to capture the love Nick and Nora had for eachother. He also kept the pace moving. He was able to deliver in a hour and a half what most directors spend 2 to 3 hours trying to do and not succeeding as well as he does.I am grateful for the DVD release of this film and so I hate to complain. I do wish that the DVD producers had put a little more detail into the extra features portion of the DVD.  This film kickstarted a sucessful fanchise, including 5 sequels and a radio program.  I would think there are some movie historians that could have put together a good documentary and or some behind the scenes stories.  The treatment this DVD got would be fine for the 5 sequels, if they ever make it to DVD.  However, this film deserved more than it got.",4,The begining of a great franchise!,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",2004,2329,"['cute', 'romantic', 'mystery', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'broke', 'new', 'ground', 'love', 'bickering', 'film', 'nice', 'break', 'more', 'typical', 'hardboiled', 'detectives', '20', '30', ""40's.I"", 'think', 'Nora', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'beautiful', 'cute', 'nose', 'aged', 'grew', 'less', 'less', 'cute', 'short', 'dark', 'hair', 'came', 'off', 'very', 'sexy', 'only', 'film', 'desire', 'see', 'Nick', 'work', 'detective', 'came', 'off', 'genuine', 'later', 'films', 'seemed', 'be', 'little', 'scripted', 'think', 'favorite', 'scene', 'when', 'Joe', 'Morelli', 'broke', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'bedroom', 'order', 'keep', 'Nora', 'getting', 'shot', 'Nick', 'punches', 'Nora', 'jaw', 'knock', 'line', 'fire', 'married', 'man', 'can', 'tell', 'Nick', 'got', 'do', 'what', 'most', 'men', 'wish', 'could', 'do', 'point', 'time', 'jk', 'Nora', 'champ', 'Instead', 'being', 'upset', 'Nick', 'upset', 'missed', 'action', 'was', 'dazed', 'floor.While', 'not', 'favorite', 'THIN', 'MAN', 'movie', 'overall', 'do', 'think', 'best', 'romantic', 'sparring', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'plot', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'moves', 'good', 'pace', ""'re"", 'not', 'familiar', 'many', '1930', 'films', ""'ll"", 'get', 'kick', '30', 'lingo', 'especially', 'womens', 'lingo', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'recreational', 'drinking', 'was', 'ever', 'as', 'carefree', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'come', 'off', 'hokey', 'quite', 'funny.The', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'relationship', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'wish', 'were', 'more', 'directors', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'today', 'lengthy', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'was', 'able', 'capture', 'love', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'had', 'eachother', 'also', 'kept', 'pace', 'moving', 'was', 'able', 'deliver', 'hour', 'half', 'what', 'most', 'directors', 'spend', '2', '3', 'hours', 'trying', 'do', 'not', 'succeeding', 'as', 'well', 'am', 'grateful', 'DVD', 'release', 'film', 'so', 'hate', 'complain', 'do', 'wish', 'DVD', 'producers', 'had', 'put', 'little', 'more', 'detail', 'extra', 'features', 'portion', 'DVD', 'film', 'kickstarted', 'sucessful', 'fanchise', 'including', '5', 'sequels', 'radio', 'program', 'would', 'think', 'are', 'movie', 'historians', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'stories', 'treatment', 'DVD', 'got', 'would', 'be', 'fine', '5', 'sequels', 'ever', 'make', 'DVD', 'However', 'film', 'deserved', 'more', 'got']",N/A

Mr. Wynant has an invention that must be kept secret. He discovers that $50,000 in government bonds is missing from his safe. He asks his secretary and girl friend Julia Wolf to return the money, then walks off into the dark night and disappears. Later his daughter Dorothy asks Nick Charles to find her father. Nora drops by with her dog Asta. Wynant's lawyer McCauley doesn't know where he is, but has been sending money. The ex-Mrs. Wynant goes to see Julia Wolf, but she won't be seeing anyone. The police begin to question the people who are involved. The film shows the carefree life of the rich during the Depression. Life is nothing but fun even at a hectic Christmas get-together. Nick drinks as if his life depended on it. [Product placement?]Nick does not investigate the Julia Wolf murder, but the people involved all come to see him. Nick goes along with Lt. Gill to talk to Arthur Nunheim; he ducks out to avoid talking, but afterwards he will talk to nobody. The police are looking for the missing Wynant. [There is some double-entendre between Nick and Nora.] Nick goes to Wynant's closed shop to investigate at night. Nick digs around and finds a clue, following Asta's interest. They estimate height and weight from the clothes - a big man at least 250 lbs. Nick observes something in one of the bones. Do skeletons all look alike? Not to forensic anthropologists today, or even then.The conventions of murder mysteries was to gather all the suspects while the detective explains how he solved the murder.

287701,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6301978420,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[3, 4]","Never have I had the opportunity to witness such an entertaining hour and a half of cinema as I did with The Thin Man.  Upon viewing (due to a suggestion from my father), I have a whole new respect for the films made in the 1930s as well as the widely unknown works of director W.S. Van Dyke.  This film was an amazing blend of comedy, who-dun-it, and satire combined into a surprisingly short 93 minutes.  The charm and wit of the characters, the classic mystery nestled between, and the surprising ending helped create this coveted piece of work.  I can honestly say this; I have seen several films come through the Hollywood machine over the years, yet none can compare to the excitement that I experienced watching this film for the first time.  I cannot wait to watch it again.  It reminded me of my first viewing of the widely hysterical television series entitled Are You Being Served?  The dialogue was extremely smart and seemed to break the boundaries of that era's cinema.I will be perfectly honest, if anyone had approached me prior to my viewing of this film and asked if I knew who William Powell was, I would have given them the classic ""stare into the darkness"" look.  Now, I cannot wait to revisit other pieces of his work.  He defined and created the film version of the Thin Man better than I have witnessed any modern day actor do.  He took a simple story, a murder mystery that would have been dull otherwise, and transformed it into this satiric comedy about sex, booze, and women.  It was a transformation that I was not ready for, which only heightened my overall experience of this film.  While some credit has to go to Van Dyke, I applaud William Powell.  His sharp tongue, his irresistible charm and charisma, and his chemistry that he had with everyone in this film, especially his wife, Nora (Myrna Loy).  The scenes that these two share show us how two people can have fun on a set, define themselves, as well as show us a new standard for the Hollywood married couple.  They broke boundaries in cinema, while continuously showing us that no media is needed to expand their hype ... a la Mr. and Mrs. Smith.  Powell and Loy carried this film and skyrocketed it past the average point and into one that will remain deeply rooted within your mind as you watch other films of the same genre.The Thin Man is another perfect example of what happens when good actors create great characters in a film that could have just passed through the average shelves.  After witnessing the power of Powell and Loy, you cannot help but also see that others in the film are trying to reach their excitement.  There is just this aura of ""fun"" and a new level of quality that is nearly absent in so much of what Hollywood today has to offer.  I am a true believer that if you have actors that want to be in the film, they give their full 100% and it shows through the screen, then the others will follow suit.  It is those films where the key players only give 10%, or we rely heavily on special effects that ultimately the film suffers.  That was not the case here at all.Finally, I would like to say that this film doesn't suffer from aging at all.  I thought that when I placed it into my player that I would be constantly reminded of how old this film was.  Knowing that it was made in the late 1930s, I thought that the jokes and comments would be dated and, perhaps less funny.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The jokes had me laughing, the circumstances had me roaring, and the fabulous connection between Nick and Nora had me glued to the screen.  This film had everything in place and executed it correctly.  While the era was dated, the jokes were not.  The words from Powell's mouth seemed refreshing and utterly hysterical.  I was impressed, and it kept me glued to the screen throughout the entire film!Overall, I couldn't have been happier about this movie.  This is what the cinema is all about.  Taking a classic story, adding in some refreshing and powerful characters, and keeping your audiences guessing until the final moment.  The Thin Man was one of those films where I didn't know who-did-it until it was revealed.  Imagine a funny film with a great caper that gives nothing away until the final climactic moment.  I know to some that seems imaginary, but friends, I witnessed it here with The Thin Man.  So, go grab your favorite girl, your best martini, and expect to have an exceptional two hours of monumental cinema!Grade: ***** out of *****",5,He didn't come anywhere near my tabloids.,1121212800,"07 13, 2005",2005,4482,"['Never', 'have', 'had', 'opportunity', 'witness', 'entertaining', 'hour', 'half', 'cinema', 'did', 'Thin', 'Man', 'viewing', 'due', 'suggestion', 'father', 'have', 'whole', 'new', 'respect', 'films', 'made', '1930s', 'as', 'well', 'widely', 'unknown', 'works', 'director', 'W.S', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'film', 'was', 'amazing', 'blend', 'comedy', 'who-dun-it', 'satire', 'combined', 'surprisingly', 'short', '93', 'minutes', 'charm', 'wit', 'characters', 'classic', 'mystery', 'nestled', 'surprising', 'ending', 'helped', 'create', 'coveted', 'piece', 'work', 'can', 'honestly', 'say', 'have', 'seen', 'several', 'films', 'come', 'Hollywood', 'machine', 'years', 'yet', 'none', 'can', 'compare', 'excitement', 'experienced', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'watch', 'again', 'reminded', 'first', 'viewing', 'widely', 'hysterical', 'television', 'series', 'entitled', 'Are', 'Being', 'Served', 'dialogue', 'was', 'extremely', 'smart', 'seemed', 'break', 'boundaries', 'era', 'cinema.I', 'will', 'be', 'perfectly', 'honest', 'anyone', 'had', 'approached', 'prior', 'viewing', 'film', 'asked', 'knew', 'who', 'William', 'Powell', 'was', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'classic', 'stare', 'darkness', 'look', 'Now', 'can', 'not', 'wait', 'revisit', 'other', 'pieces', 'work', 'defined', 'created', 'film', 'version', 'Thin', 'Man', 'better', 'have', 'witnessed', 'modern', 'day', 'actor', 'do', 'took', 'simple', 'story', 'murder', 'mystery', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'dull', 'otherwise', 'transformed', 'satiric', 'comedy', 'sex', 'booze', 'women', 'was', 'transformation', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'only', 'heightened', 'overall', 'experience', 'film', 'credit', 'go', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'applaud', 'William', 'Powell', 'sharp', 'tongue', 'irresistible', 'charm', 'charisma', 'chemistry', 'had', 'everyone', 'film', 'especially', 'wife', 'Nora', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'scenes', 'two', 'share', 'show', 'how', 'two', 'people', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'set', 'define', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'new', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'married', 'couple', 'broke', 'boundaries', 'cinema', 'continuously', 'showing', 'media', 'needed', 'expand', 'hype', 'la', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Smith', 'Powell', 'Loy', 'carried', 'film', 'skyrocketed', 'average', 'point', 'one', 'will', 'remain', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'mind', 'watch', 'other', 'films', 'same', 'genre.The', 'Thin', 'Man', 'perfect', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'good', 'actors', 'create', 'great', 'characters', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'passed', 'average', 'shelves', 'witnessing', 'power', 'Powell', 'Loy', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'also', 'see', 'others', 'film', 'are', 'trying', 'reach', 'excitement', 'just', 'aura', 'fun', 'new', 'level', 'quality', 'nearly', 'absent', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'today', 'offer', 'am', 'true', 'believer', 'have', 'actors', 'want', 'be', 'film', 'give', 'full', '100', '%', 'screen', 'then', 'others', 'will', 'follow', 'suit', 'films', 'where', 'key', 'players', 'only', 'give', '10', '%', 'rely', 'heavily', 'special', 'effects', 'ultimately', 'film', 'suffers', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'all.Finally', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'aging', 'thought', 'when', 'placed', 'player', 'would', 'be', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'how', 'old', 'film', 'was', 'Knowing', 'was', 'made', 'late', '1930s', 'thought', 'jokes', 'comments', 'would', 'be', 'dated', 'perhaps', 'less', 'funny', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'more', 'wrong', 'jokes', 'had', 'laughing', 'circumstances', 'had', 'roaring', 'fabulous', 'connection', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'had', 'glued', 'screen', 'film', 'had', 'everything', 'place', 'executed', 'correctly', 'era', 'was', 'dated', 'jokes', 'were', 'not', 'words', 'Powell', 'mouth', 'seemed', 'refreshing', 'utterly', 'hysterical', 'was', 'impressed', 'kept', 'glued', 'screen', 'entire', 'film', 'Overall', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'movie', 'what', 'cinema', 'Taking', 'classic', 'story', 'adding', 'refreshing', 'powerful', 'characters', 'keeping', 'audiences', 'guessing', 'final', 'moment', 'Thin', 'Man', 'was', 'one', 'films', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'who-did-it', 'was', 'revealed', 'Imagine', 'funny', 'film', 'great', 'caper', 'nothing', 'away', 'final', 'climactic', 'moment', 'know', 'imaginary', 'friends', 'witnessed', 'here', 'Thin', 'Man', 'So', 'go', 'grab', 'favorite', 'girl', 'best', 'martini', 'expect', 'have', 'exceptional', 'two', 'hours', 'monumental', 'cinema', 'Grade', '*****', '*****']",N/A

The reason to watch this movie is the great writing and the incredible chemistry between Powell and Loy.The movie succeeds on many levels.  It is a funny movie, but not filled with obvious gags.  The banter seems natural and not forced.  It is still very funny.  (My wife almost snorted her drink through her nose a number of times during the film.)  There are things that are dated, but still very watchable by a modern audience.It is also an interesting detective story.  There is suspense and more than a bit of mystery.  The ending seems a bit of a cleche, but it works.  (Probably less so since so many movies tried a similar formula since then, but not as well.)The DVD has the trailers for all the Thin Man movies.

287703,AGEIT17HENDIS,6301978420,Alfred Johnson,"[1, 3]","THIS REVIEW WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN FOR THE BOOK BY THE SAME NAME. THE MAIN POINTS THERE APPLY TO THE FILM. I WOULD ONLY ADD THAT WILLIAM POWELL AND MYRNA LOY ARE WELL CAST FOR THE URBANE DETECTIVE AND HIS 'AMATEUR'  SLEUTH HIGH SOCIETY WIFE. AS FOR THE 5 SEQUELS AS WITH ALL SUCH VENTURES THERE IS A LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURN. ONE GETS CHARLES FATIGUE AFTER THE SECOND FILM. IF YOU NEED A DOSE OF URBANE DETECTIVE THEN STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. THAT'S IS CLOSER TO HAMMETT'S REAL INTENTION.Dashiell Hammett is perhaps better known for creating the classic modern prototypical detective, one Sam Spade the detective-hero (or anti-hero, if you prefer) of the literary noir Maltese Falcon. With the earlier Thin Man he took a different tack in providing a model detective- the urbane Nick Charles, his side-kick society wife Nora and their ever present faithful dog companion, Asta. The story line here centers on a missing eccentric inventor/businessman who it is suspected having committed various acts of foul play. Enter Nick, Nora and Asta at the request of his wondering society family (wondering, that is, about the fate of the dough necessary to keep them in their luxuries) and after a series of misadventures and false leads Nick grabs the villain. That is what old Nick has in common with the illustrious Mr. Spade-the dogged (not pun, intended) and tenacious search for the truth and the killer, come what may. If you like your detectives with a light touch this is for you. If you like your detective novels to be minor works of literary art this is also for you. Hammett (along with Raymond Chandler) practically reinvented the previously rather shabby art of the early detective story into literature.

287705,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301978420,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The one adjective that I think really describes this movie is `fun'.  That's an adjective, right?  They use it on `Family Feud' all the time (""this is my FUN sister Martha"") so I figure that it has to be one.  Anyways, this movie is `fun' personified, `fun' times 100.The movie is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!Anyways, enough blabbering.  The film centers around a boozy couple named Nick and Nora (this is not about their infinite playlist) who find themselves pulled into a `missing person/murder mystery' when they are approached by the young Dorothy who is in desperate search for her father.  Shortly after her father disappears his lover winds up dead only to have her murder and the subsequent murder of an informant pinned on the missing man.  Nick is pretty certain that the police are on the trail of an innocent man, but proving his theory is a matter of, well, you just have to watch.That last dinner scene is just marvelous!For me, this film is just pure entertainment.  It is a film noir meets a comedy meets a thriller, and it nails every nook and cranny beautifully.William Powell is brilliant as Nick.  If it weren't for Clark Gable's equally stunning work in `It Happened One Night', I'd say that Powell should have taken the Oscar.  Sure, alcoholic is a slight gimmick, but he plays that gimmick beautifully.  Myrna Loy is a clever and complimentary sidekick, but she definitely lacks the `pop' that Powell brings to his every scene.

But this was made in 1934, and those cliches were original here. In fact, it was written by Dashiell Hammett, who is known for his great detective stories.There's Nick Charles (William Powell) who has married heiress Nora (Myrna Loy) and retired from being a detective. But of course a really smart detective never really retires, because cases fall in his lap and his curiosity drives him to solve the puzzle. Also, in this case, his wife is terribly eager to see him solve the mystery and be the hero.Maureen O'Sullivan plays Dorothy Wynant, daughter of an eccentric but highly successful inventor. She's about to be married to Tommy (Henry Wadsworth) and begs her father to be back from his mysterious trip before her wedding on December 30. When Christmas comes and he's not back yet, she starts to worry. She asks Nick Charles to find him, but he's not interested. Obviously, events get him interested.Without giving too much away, there ends up being three murders that need solving, not just one. And the press all figure it was Wynant (William Henry) who committed all three. But Nick doesn't think so. So, in the classic style, Nick and Nora invite all the suspects to dinner, and Nick manages to trick the real murderer into revealing . . . ah, you think I'd give you a clue with a pronoun?

The twists of the plot are not the stuff of The Maltese Falcon, although I, like many other viewers, had no idea who the murderer was until the final dinner party scene. The secret here is the acting of William Powell and his interactions with his beautiful high society wife, Myrna Loy. Their unapologetic drinking is absolutely hilarious and wonderfully politically incorrect. Indeed, it is even more unacceptable today than it was back then. It gives The Thin Man a dated but unique feel. Powell is a former detective who got rich and out of the business via marriage, but, despite his time off, he remains more clever than the police.

It spawned a series of ""A"" pictures which kept the quality just as high and the moviegoing public couldn't get enough of Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles. Perhaps because those sequels were so good it is easy to forget just how spectacular was ""The Thin Man.""William Powell and Myrna Loy sparkled as the a couple living the lush life and having fun being married. Nick (Powell) had been a celebrated detective who enjoyed drinking martinis as much as solving crimes, so when his wife Nora (Loy) inherited a fortune he opted for more of the former and less of the latter. Nora, who enjoyed martinis as well, had a nose for mystery, however, and couldn't wait for an opportunity to drag a somewhat tight Nick into a case.It became a formula repeated for decades but only on rare occasions did anything in the movies come close to the style and sophistication of the original source. The screenplay of Albert Hackett and Francis Goodrich perfectly captured the contrast of Hammett's wonderful couple and their dog Asta against the backdrop of murder. Their banter is legendary and was at its zenith in director W.S. Van Dyke's introduction to mystery's favorite couple.Set during the Christmas season, ""The Thin Man"" works as a mystery, a sophisticated marital comedy, and a holiday film. James Wong Howe's photography and William Axt's delightful score added just the right touch for a great cast, most notably a lovely young Maureen O'Sullivan. The actual storyline is quite dark and seemy when one stopped to think about it, but the pace was so quick and the tone so playful that audiences were too busy being entertained to do so.The story involves the rich and eccentric father of Dorothy (O'Sullivan) disappearing suddenly. Nick, who knows her father, and just about every other oddball or criminal in the funny papers gets dragged into the search when his mistress gets murdered and everyone seems to think he's working the case. A couple of murders and several hundred shakers of martinis later, Nick gathers all the suspects together at a dinner party and solves the case.Everything between the opening credits and the closing is a sheer delight that will make you remember how much fun it can be going to the movies. There is a bit more set-up here than in the films that followed as the actual solving of the mystery was as important as the fun Nick and Nora were having while doing it. Afterwards the focus would be shifted to the fun with the mysteries being secondary.This easily ranks as one of the top ten films ever made. For sheer entertainment, it is absolutely unbeatable. Just like those Americans jamming into packed theatres to see it upon its first release, those seeing it for the first time will long for more. Fortunately, there are more, and nearly just as good.

Nick (William Powell), a former sleuth, wants to settle down into a quiet lifestyle and manage Nora's (Myrna Loy) various inheritances, but his fun-loving wife would adore for Nick to involve them in the occasional murder mystery.  She gets her wish when Nick's former client Wynant (Edward Ellis) goes AWOL shortly before his daughter (Maureen O'Sullivan) is to be married.  To complicate matters further, Wynant's beautiful secretary Julia (Natalie Moorhead) is later found shot to death in her office.Can Nick and Nora manage to track down the killer--and Wynant--before the bodycount rises again?  Is Wynant the killer?  The mystery almost becomes incidental as we watch the most wonderful married couple ever to set foot on the screen!  William Powell and Myrna Loy were, I'm convinced, born to play the roles of Nick and Nora Charles.  Their performances are sublime.  Sit back and revel in the snappy dialogue and witty banter.  A classic that only gets younger.The DVD includes a bonus trailer gallery for the other titles in the ""Thin Man"" series.  Highly recommended!",5,"""Hey, would you mind putting that gun away?

287722,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6301978420,calvinnme,"[1, 1]","This is one of my favorite movies from any decade. William Powell and Myrna Loy have such chemistry together it is hard to believe the differences in their ages - He was 42 and she 29 when they made this movie. Their expressions during their verbal sparrings are priceless. Under different circumstances it might be easy to dislike Nick and Nora Charles - they are the idle rich who spend their time overindulging in alcohol, having loud parties, and destroying their own property with air rifles at a time (1934) when much of America was starving through the worst part of the Great Depression. On top of that, Nick makes no secret of how appealing his wife's money is to him. However, the intricate plot, the couple's clever dialogue, and their chemistry draw you in and make their world even seem somewhat normal.Due to all of the ""Thin Man"" sequels, most people think that the Thin Man refers to Nick Charles. However, in the original novel and in this movie the Thin Man refers to Clyde Wynant, a somewhat absent-minded inventor, the chief suspect in what turns out to be three murders, and someone who only actually appears in the first 15 minutes of the film, never to be seen afterwards.The Charles' get caught up in the mystery of Wynant's disappearance because his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) is an old friend of Nick's and asks Nick for his help. Wynant has told his daughter that he is going off somewhere secret to work on an invention so that nobody can steal it from him, but promises he will be back before Christmas so he can be present at her wedding. However, Wynant has never resurfaced and nobody has heard from him. Nick initially has no interest in continuing his former occupation of detective - he is much more interested in having a good time - until a series of circumstances and his own wife's urging draw him into the mystery and back into his role as private detective.Perhaps the reason that the Charles' lifestyle doesn't rankle the viewer is because the film is full of unsavory characters. Wynant's family is truly disfunctional. His son is an oddball bookworm obsessed with abnormal psychology, his ex-wife has remarried a gigolo who appears to be hiding a questionable past and finds the idea of working for a living insulting, and Wynant's girlfriend is a very greedy and aging ex-flapper who steps out on Wynant with other men whenever she thinks he isn't noticing. The only virtuous characters in the film seem to be Wynant's daughter and her fiance. In short, there is no shortage of possible suspects and worthy victims. Even the police in the film are unappealing - they are very good at getting rough with people and performing illegal searches, but not very quick on finding clues or making even obvious deductions. The constantly semi-innebriated Nick Charles has no problem running circles around them and turns out to be both brave and brilliant in his role as sleuth.The stark portrayal of human shortcomings, the scenarios in which unmarried people are obviously living together although nobody in the film comes out and calls it that, and some of the double-entendres worthy of the Marx Brothers make me wonder how this film got past the censors over seventy years ago. However, that is not what keeps it fresh and interesting today. What keeps it interesting through the years is that it has in its lead characters the magic of Astaire and Rogers minus the dance numbers. As an aside, I've watched it several times, and I keep coming up with one obvious production gaffe. Everyone keeps saying at Christmas that Wynant has been missing three months. However, at the beginning of the movie, right before Wynant leaves town and is talking to his daughter, a snowstorm kicks up. There really has been an onset of global warming if September snowstorms in New York City were common in 1934! I recommend this film to anyone who likes a good murder mystery laced with a bit of dark comedy.The DVD set entitled ""The Complete Thin Man Collection"" contains all of the Thin Man movies, the last one having been made in 1947.

I finally found it the other night and was thrilled to have finally sat down to watch.I love a few things: Myrna Loy, whose beauty belied her exquisite comic timing; William Powell, who could be captured on black-and-white film doing nothing more than reading his junk mail, and still be alternately heartwarming and hysterical and worth watching for two hours; and the era, which is captured beautifully here in terms of the costumes and sets, the social interactions, the dialogue, and the morals and mores of the day; and snappy dialogue sparked with wit and intelligence.This is typical of films of the era in that the acting is not consistent. While the stars are indeed stellar, some of the other actors must have been related to or lying under the producers, because while it's a comedy, I found myself laughing at the occasional artless delivery of lines and physicality.Atypical of the films of the era, this manages to cross genres, between comedy and true whodunnit mystery, sacrificing neither through the combination. The writing is crisp and witty, and the twists and turns in the unfolding detective plot will truly leave you wondering which of the many suspects is to blame until the very last.The one totally confusing part for me: three actresses who are all about the same age, all about the same level of not-too-pretty, and all with about the same amount of screen time (with only one exception, never sharing a scene), all seem to share the same platinum blonde wig, as well.

He sends her off to see Grant's tomb, rather than join him in some sleuthing.  Definitely not our modern day sensibilities.  He even hits her in one scene, the movie excuses it since she was in the line of fire, but I still was uncomfortable with it.

William Powell and Myrna Loy, as Nick and Nora Charles, are a wealthy pair of newlyweds from California are visiting Nick's old haunts from his days as a private detective in new York City.  William Powell with the requisite dark hair and mustache for a leading man at the time ""tipsies"" his way through his martini-ridden role with aplomb.  Myrna Loy's Nora is exquisitely beautiful, successful, wealthy and perfectly cast as a Zelda Fitzgerald-like spoiled playgirl.The disappearance of a young Maureen O'Hara's scientist father is the catalyst for the action. Nora pushes Nick to get involved in the case in order to see him work and as a way to keep their holiday party going. Suspects are numerous and colorful.  Caesar Romero appears in one of his first roles as a polygamous gigolo. There is a greedy ex-wife, an unfaithful mistress, a stool pigeon, and plenty of red herrings thrown in for good measure.No kidding, the movie climaxes with one of the original dinner table revelations of the killer, so wonderfully mined by many comics since.

287729,A423XLYS1Q1D6,6301978420,"Christian Wheeler ""Husband/Father/Gamer/Proud...","[20, 20]","The first film in a highly succesful series, ""The Thin Man"" remains one of the best American movies. Filmed in just two weeks by Woody Van Dyke (known as ""One-Shot"" for his speed and efficiency) and adapted from a Dashiell Hammett story, this is a dynamite blend of murder mystery and clever comedy. William Powell and Myrna Loy are wonderful as Nick and Nora Charles, playing off each other with affectionate, teasing wit. There's humor to spare; lots of snappy one-liners, sexual innuendo and double-entendres (my favorites: ""He didn't come anywhere near my tabloids"" and ""What's that man doing in my drawers?"") and some great situational comedy (such as when Nora attempts to out-drink Nick, who never met a mixed drink he didn't like). And of course, there's Asta, the delighfully mischievous pooch who nearly steals the picture, and would become as much of a sensation as the two leads.Although not as hard-boiled or intricate as say, Raymond Chandler's work, the mystery aspect of the story is well-done, with enough twists to keep the viewer guessing until the revelatory moment. Had the film been more intense, or more violent, the comedic aspects would have come across as jarring and disruptive.

DeRiemer,"[5, 5]","If anyone wanted to get a feel for what Thirties' escapism was all about -- the style, the insouciance -- they couldn't do better than watching The Thin Man or the Astaire-Rogers movies. In The Thin Man, a scientist with money disappears, many people could benefit, and Nick and Nora Charles are drawn into the mystery. William Powell and Myrna Loy are captivating. Nick and Nora may be drunks, or at least have cast iron livers, but they are a smart, sophisticated, funny and affectionate couple. I'm not sure any two leading actors ever showed such great chemistry together as Powell and Loy did.Roger Ebert has said that The Thin Man is essentially a drawing room comedy with dead bodies. While the mystery is interesting, it's the style of the movie, the funny, urbane dialogue, the elegant look of the thing (and the elegant looks of Loy and Powell), that keep you watching with a smile. ""I'm a hero,"" Nick says. ""I was shot two times in the Tribune."" ""I read where you were shot five times in the tabloids,"" says Nora. ""It's not true,"" Nick says. ""He didn't come anywhere near my tabloids."" The close of the movie, a dinner party at Nick and Nora's apartment where the guests are all suspects and the waiters are all cops, and where Nick unmasks the killer with Nora's wry encouragment, is a clever and amusing set piece. ""Waiter,' Nora says, ""will you serve the nuts? I mean, will you serve the guests the nuts?""Five sequels were made. I've seen three. While the name ""The Thin Man"" lived on, the thin man himself didn't survive this first movie. He was what the mystery was all about.It is amazing to think that this film is 70 years old.

287733,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,6301978420,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[1, 1]","This is the first film of The Thin Man series based on the book by Dashiell Hammett. The Thin Man is a perfect combination of whodunit mystery, comedy, and romance.This is a film I've watched 20 times, maybe more. The whole series is our family's favorite film. My first exposure to this movie was on VHS, which was very quickly replaced by the six movie box set on Laserdisc, and then finally the box set on DVD.Nick Charles is a ""retired"" detective that returns to New York City with his new wife, Nora and their dog Asta. Nick is asked by the lovely daughter of an inventor to find the killer of her step mother. Nora convinces Nick to take on the case.The unusual thing about the Thin Man series, the story is almost irrelevant. These are light hearted, good natured films. There is an incredible chemistry between the phenomenally gorgeous Myrna Loy (Nora) and distinguished handsome William Powell (Nick). The story line is almost a pretext to have these two actors on the screen. Where Hammett's novel is dark, more like a Bogart film (Hammett wrote The Maltese Falcon), the Thin Man is funny with a mysterious edge.This film was made in the middle of the depression. Nick and Nora have no worries about money. In this film, it isn't clear where the money came from, it could be Nick worked hard, solved a lot of famous cases and made a lot of money at it. In a one liner at the middle of the film, Nick says he married Nora for her money. They live in a hotel, have parties all the time, and have absolutely no care in the world. It is a fantasy existence that people in the middle of the depression had to love. It still plays well today.The charming part of this film, Loy and Powell are on an even footing with the jokes. Sometimes the punch line is delivered by Myrna Loy, other times by William Powell. The punch lines are always directed at how much they care for each other. Although Nick may look at a beautiful woman, he always acknowledges Nora as the only woman in his life. Sometimes he gets the order wrong. The Maitre 'D at a restaurant looks sideways at Nick as Nora and Asta show up in the bar. Nick says, ""Oh, it's all right, Joe. It's all right. It's my dog. And, uh, my wife."" Nora snaps back, ""Well you might have mentioned me first on the billing.""The DVD has one bonus feature, the trailer. This is not a spectacular transfer, the print is slightly dirty. However, the black and white is nicely rendered, with maybe a little tiny bit too much contrast.A classic wonderful film that I can watch over and over. It is one of my favorite films of all time.

Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","In 1934, cinema goers were treated to the American comic detective film known as The Thin Man starring William Powell (""Ziegfeld Follies"", ""My Man Godfrey"", ""Manhattan Melodrama"") and Myrna Loy (""Manhattan Melodrama"", ""The Great Ziegfeld"", ""The Best Years of Our Lives"").The film is an adaptation of the popular detective novel by Dashiel Hammett (which would be his last novel) and the film would inspire five more sequels (which have been collected in a DVD box set titled ""The Complete Thin Man Collection"") and also inspired the 1950's ""Thin Man"" television series.  The film is ranked #32 for the American Film Institutes 100 Laughs and was added to the US National Film Registry in 1997 having been deemed as ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".VIDEO & AUDIO:""The Thin Man"" is featured in black and white (1:33 aspect ratio) in standard 43 full frame.  The film actually looks quite incredible with only the occasional dust and scratches showing up from time-to-time but the blacks are nice and deep.  grays and whites are well-defined and picture quality on DVD is quite solid for a film that is 75 years old.As for audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital monaural (English and French).  The film is center channel driven, audio is clear and understandable but for those with modern receivers can set their audio for audio on all channels for a more immersive soundtrack.Subtitles are in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Thin Man"" comes with the theatrical trailers for all six ""Thin Man"" films and text listing of William Powell and Myrna Loy's film career.JUDGMENT CALL:""The Thin Man"" has always intrigued me because I've read about it for so long but have never watched it.  But with all six films released in a DVD box set (which I purchased new on Amazon for [...]), with its low price, ""The Complete Thin Man Collection"" was a steal and definitely a must-buy!I've read about how William Powell and Myrna Loy were a fantastic onscreen couple and after watching the first film ""The Thin Man"", the two are just fantastic together.  Although, there was no romance between the two outside of the film, onscreen the two had wonderful chemistry and the amount of jokes and the husband and wife banter in the film was just fun and hilarious.  I often wonder if some of the things they did on screen (jokes and making faces) were improvised or if director W.S. Van Dyke had this all planned out in the beginning.But for me, what captivated me was the chemistry from the two major talent but also Myrna Loy.  I truly believe that she is one actress that is under-rated but so talented.  I've read that in the 1920's, the parts she most played where vixen type of roles during the silent film era and that it was ""The Thin Man"" that really brought her to prominence as an actress.  She has this natural beauty and comedic quirk that I found so wonderful and again, the way she and William Powell clicked, was quite amazing and like many people back throughout the past seven decades, I found myself captivated towards their wonderful performance together.Overall, the film was an entertaining film, especially to find out that the adaptation of Dashiell Hammet's novel only took three weeks to film and I suppose that is the strength of the director W.S. Van Dyke.  For me, the film didn't seemed rush, everything came together quite well in terms of pacing, editing and also the overall screenplay and it helps to have two talents that make things quite believable and fun to watch.I have five more films yet to watch in the box set and I've read and heard many times that the sequels do not quite meet the level of this first film but as mentioned, getting all six films in one box set for under [...] (note: prices for this box set have fluctuated throughout the year but I purchased this at that low price before Christmas) is fantastic plus you get another DVD featuring documentaries on both William Powell and Myrna Loy plus classic comedy, mystery and musical shorts, two radio dramas, vintage cartoons and also the TV series pilot.  Picture quality was pretty solid for this DVD and for the most part, you're getting your bang for the buck with this box set.If you are a fan of ""The Thin Man"" or like myself, have been curious about the film and wanted to see this magic onscreen between William Powell and Myrna Loy, this film and ""The Complete Thin Man Collection"" is highly recommended!",5,A wonderful film and a wonderful pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy!

287737,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,6301978420,Dennis Littrell,"[0, 0]","This, the first Thin Man, is one of the most beloved of the old time movies, and watching it for the first time since I was a child--I'm sure I saw it in the fifties at one of those three features, a cartoon and Movietone for a dime theaters, but remember nothing--it's not hard to see why.  The chemistry between William Powell and Myrna Loy (Nick and Nora Charles) is effervescent, bubbly and delicious.  It is obvious they are in love and take such joy in each other's company while teasing each other in a most delightful way.  You will just love the way Asta, their dog (who is quite a star in this movie himself) covers his eyes in the final scene--such a delicate dog with such delicate feelings!  (Actually I understand that all dogs in movies in those days at least were females for reasons that might be imagined.)The movie starts a little slow by modern standards, like a stage play, but becomes increasingly enthralling, until suddenly it is over, and YES, let's do a sequel!  And they did, six of them, but, well, sequels may or may not be as good as the original.  In this case, I understand they weren't and I'm not surprised.  It would be hard to achieve something like The Thin Man again.  Everything just fell into place, the plot was agreeable and clever, the lesser characters quirky and intriguing, the direction by W.S. ""One Take Woody"" Van Dyke smooth and focused, and the twenties going on the thirties (but not really) atmosphere was authentic with the rich holding lavish dinner parties and drinking way too much, especially Nick Charles (Powell) who complained that sleuthing caused him to get behind in his drinking.The witty dialogue comes first from Dashiell Hammett's novel and then from Albert Hackett who adapted the script.  Hackett was just getting warmed up.  He wrote his first script in 1931 (something called Up Pops the Devil) and his last for The Father of the Bride Part II in 1995 at the age of 95!--well, he got partial credit for that script which was morphed out of his 1951 script for Father's Little Dividend and the original Father of the Bride (1951).By the way, I always imagined that ""the thin man"" was the detective Nick Charles, but actually the thin man is Clyde Wynant, the eccentric inventor played by Edward Ellis who goes missing after the first reel. However, everybody thought the same thing, so in the sequels, the thin man is the detective!One of the reasons the repartee between Nick and Nora is so great is that it was taken (somewhat) from real life exchanges between Hammett and his longtime live-together girl friend the celebrated playwright, Lillian Hellman.Anybody with any pretension of knowing Hollywood films has seen this.  See it yourself if you haven't.

How much has already been said about the greatness of this movie? It is all most likely true, haven't read it, but having seen the movie enough times to know that I really should read the book. The casting is classic 1930's, campy and cute; the acting is superb, and thee lead couple is the ideal of anyone serious about not being serious about life. There are only a few ""classic movie lines"" int his incarnation of screwball comedy but it still unfolds like a masterfully made puzzle. The screenplay is fun and witty and shows off the talents of Myrna Loy and William Powell. Even Astor the dog is shot well enough to be remotely believable in his comic role.The movie suffers from the racism of its time, but that is the way of any time--entertainment parallels the cultural virtues and follies of the era.

And the movie adaptation is even better -- a witty, zingy mystery with a lovable pair of detectives and their dog. No wonder it spawned five sequels, even though Hammett never wrote another.Inventor Clyde Wynant is missing. At a party, his daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan) sees detective-turned-rich-hubby Nick Charles (William Powell) and asks for his help in finding her dad. But when Clyde's secretary/mistress is murdered, Clyde is the primary suspect -- especially when other bodies show up.Nick is resolutely determined not to get involved, but between the police and his rich wife Nora (Myrna Loy), he finds himself enmeshed in the case. He believes that Wynant didn't do it, but the case is covered with false clues and hidden motives -- until Nick himself unearths a skeleton in Wynant's workshop, which will solve the whole case.From the first moment you see Nick dancing with his shaker, it's obvious that ""Thin Man"" is a winner. It was the first of six films starring Nick, Nora and Asta the wire-haired terrier, and while Hammet never wrote anything more about this detecting team, that didn't stop Hollywood from continuing their saga.This is a tight, suspenseful little mystery, with plenty of suspects that might have done it, but you never quite know who did actually do the murder. But the story is peppered with astoundingly funny dialogue (""I heard you got shot five times in the tabloids."" ""That's a lie! They didn't come anywhere NEAR my tabloids""), and a cast of weirdos, ranging from gangsters to greedy ex-wives to wooden gigolos.Nick and Nora (based on Hammett and Lillian Hellman) are absolutely delightful. And Powell and Loy are absolutely electric in this movie, exchanging witty barbs (""Oh, Nicky, I love you... because you know such lovely people"") and pretending they don't adore each other. This is ideal movie chemistry.They're also backed by good performances from Nat Pendleton, William Henry and the Minna Gombell as the hard-boiled cop Nick is helping out, the creepy hyperintellectual Wynant son, and Wynant's greedy, pop-eyed ex-wife. But all the performances here are solid; the flattest acting is done by Asta.With its kinetic dialogue and tight plot, it's easy to see why ""The Thin Man"" is a classic. But the real reason to watch it is simply Powell and Loy.",5,"Waiter, will you serve the nuts?",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,2421,"['Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'best', 'known', 'hard-boiled', 'detectives', 'struck', 'gold', 'when', 'created', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'even', 'better', 'witty', 'zingy', 'mystery', 'lovable', 'pair', 'detectives', 'dog', 'wonder', 'spawned', 'five', 'sequels', 'even', 'Hammett', 'never', 'wrote', 'another.Inventor', 'Clyde', 'Wynant', 'missing', 'party', 'daughter', 'Dorothy', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'detective-turned-rich-hubby', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'William', 'Powell', 'help', 'finding', 'dad', 'when', 'Clyde', 'secretary/mistress', 'murdered', 'Clyde', 'primary', 'suspect', 'especially', 'when', 'other', 'bodies', 'show', 'up.Nick', 'resolutely', 'determined', 'not', 'get', 'involved', 'police', 'rich', 'wife', 'Nora', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'enmeshed', 'case', 'Wynant', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'case', 'covered', 'false', 'clues', 'hidden', 'motives', 'Nick', 'unearths', 'skeleton', 'Wynant', 'workshop', 'will', 'solve', 'whole', 'case.From', 'first', 'moment', 'see', 'Nick', 'dancing', 'shaker', 'obvious', 'Thin', 'Man', 'winner', 'was', 'first', 'six', 'films', 'starring', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Asta', 'wire-haired', 'terrier', 'Hammet', 'never', 'wrote', 'anything', 'more', 'detecting', 'team', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Hollywood', 'continuing', 'saga.This', 'tight', 'suspenseful', 'little', 'mystery', 'plenty', 'suspects', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'never', 'quite', 'know', 'who', 'did', 'actually', 'do', 'murder', 'story', 'peppered', 'astoundingly', 'funny', 'dialogue', 'heard', 'got', 'shot', 'five', 'times', 'tabloids', 'lie', 'did', ""n't"", 'come', 'anywhere', 'NEAR', 'tabloids', 'cast', 'weirdos', 'ranging', 'gangsters', 'greedy', 'ex-wives', 'wooden', 'gigolos.Nick', 'Nora', 'based', 'Hammett', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'are', 'absolutely', 'delightful', 'Powell', 'Loy', 'are', 'absolutely', 'electric', 'movie', 'exchanging', 'witty', 'barbs', 'Oh', 'Nicky', 'love', 'know', 'such', 'lovely', 'people', 'pretending', 'do', ""n't"", 'adore', 'other', 'ideal', 'movie', 'chemistry.They', ""'re"", 'also', 'backed', 'good', 'performances', 'Nat', 'Pendleton', 'William', 'Henry', 'Minna', 'Gombell', 'hard-boiled', 'cop', 'Nick', 'helping', 'out', 'creepy', 'hyperintellectual', 'Wynant', 'son', 'Wynant', 'greedy', 'pop-eyed', 'ex-wife', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'solid', 'flattest', 'acting', 'done', 'Asta.With', 'kinetic', 'dialogue', 'tight', 'plot', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'Thin', 'Man', 'classic', 'real', 'reason', 'watch', 'simply', 'Powell', 'Loy']",N/A

At a time when women did not have the ""rights"" or social standing as they do today, it was very refreshing to watch Myrna Loy's character as she proves to be the mental equal of her husband, Bill Powell's character frequently coming up on top during their frequent and entertaining verbal repartees.  It has been suggested that the characters of Nick and Nora Charles were based upon writer Dashiell Hammett and his long time lover Lillian Hellman.Unfortunately, the Special Features of this DVD are sparse and are really nothing to shout about but for the quality of the overall content, this makes this DVD good value of money nevertheless and is a great screwball romantic comedy that ages very well and is still enjoyable by audiences today.Highly recommended!",5,"""I Was Just a Gleam In My Father's Eye...""

287752,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6301978420,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[118, 121]","THE THIN MAN is a landmark film in so many ways that it is difficult to over-estimate either its impact or its brilliance.  Based on the popular novel by Dashiell Hammet, the film presents us with a completely egalitarian husband and wife who trade witticisms as freely as they mix cocktails--and the concept was so completely unexpected that it proved extremely controversial in the 1930s and even today still sets the standard for witty comedies in which couples engage in clever verbal sparring.  The script is sharp and clever; the cinematography by James Wong Howe anticipates later film noir by mixing glossy black and white beauty with an underlying grittiness; W.S. Van Dyke's direction is fast paced and never allows your attention to wander; the supporting cast is remarkably fine; and the production values offer MGM at the height of its considerable powers.All of this would be enough to make THE THIN MAN memorable, but what really elevates it into a rarified atmosphere is the chemistry between leads William Powell and Myrna Loy, who handle their lines like sparkling rapiers, playing a combination of dry wit and unexpectedly silliness in high relief against a remarkably dark tale of multiple murder.  Hard drinking, and mixing socially with both the uppercrust and the underworld, they are the people we would like to be in the sort of relationship we would like to acheive: glamorous, stylish, intelligent, and having tremendous fun as they work together to track down a missing inventor who may or may not be responsible for his lover's sudden murder.  Although Powell and Loy made numerous films together, including five sequels to this one, THE THIN MAN shows them at their zenith, and I can think of no other screen couple to date who have played so effectively together.Regrettably, the DVD release has not been restored, and although the print is crisp it does contain a number of blemishes; similarly, although the DVD does include trailers for all of the ""Thin Man"" films Powell and Loy made, the bonus features hardly do justice to the film's inexhaustible charms.  Still, I do recommend the DVD over a VHS for the simple reason that you are likely to return to the film again and again, hoping some of the Powell-Loy sophistocation will rub off--and in the process you are likely to wear out a VHS in fairly short order.

But I still wanted to show my support for this classic so I thought I'd contribute with some hopefully interesting facts and trivia re The Thin Man.This was the second pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy, the first being Manhattan Melodrama (1934). But t'was The Thin Man that cemented their star status in Hollywood. The wonderful rapport between the two was the selling point of the movie (sorry, Dashiell Hammett), rendering the mystery plot of secondary importance (something about a missing, possibly murdered inventor).Myrna Loy had been in about 80 films, silent and sound, mostly playing ""other women"" and exotic vamps, before The Thin Man came her way. MGM was reluctant to co-star Myrna Loy in The Thin Man, feeling that Myrna wasn't right for the role. Also, time constraints played a part as the studio had plans to star her in Stamboul Quest, which begins filming in 3 weeks. Director Woody ""One-Take"" Van Dyke threatened to walk out and MGM relented but on one condition: The Thin Man had to be completed in under 3 weeks. Van Dyke finished in 16 days. Myrna played her last exotic role in Stamboul Quest and never looked back.The Thin Man offered two unprecedented elements. Firstly, the film played up folks having fun with murder and second, the two leads were portrayed as a wisecracking, happily wedded couple who were witty, refined and relished being married. Movies back then would normally have their couples getting out of marriage or ending up being married in the finale. No one before had actually explored the realm of the hip and happily wedded husband and wife in the body of the film. The MGM executives were very nervous at the first preview of the film, unsure of the movie's reception. But they needn't have worried.Van Dyke knew what he wanted. He instructed Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich, the husband-and-wife screenwriters, to focus on Nick and Nora's relationship and to pay lesser attention to the murder mystery.The Thin Man series has proven to be a training ground for young, up-and-coming actors. After the Thin Man (1936) co-stars Jimmy Stewart, oozing his soon-to-be-patented aw-shucks sincerity, while Shadow of the Thin Man (1941) features lovely, wholesome Donna Reed in a co-starring role. This first Thin Man, of course, showcases the gamine Maureen O'Sullivan.Myrna Loy recalled that the cast was never allowed to make friends with the various wire-haired terriers who played Asta, as it might distract the thespian dogs.The Thin Man doesn't refer to Nick Charles but to lanky, cranky inventor and murder victim Clyde Wynant.There was a 72-episode Thin Man television series (1957-59) starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk.Before William Powell was immortalized as Nick Charles, he played gentleman detective Philo Vance in The Canary Murder Case (1929), The Greene Murder Case (1929), The Benson Murder Case (1930) and The Kennel Murder Case (1933).The novel The Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett is an excellent short mystery novel. While not as witty and funny as the movie, it's still a very good read. Unfortunately, unlike the movie version, the book never spawned a sequel.",5,"""Will you serve the nuts?

Parisi ""Robert and Heather Parisi""","[0, 1]","IN A NUTSHELL: 'THE THIN MAN' DELIVERS: CHEMISTRY - GAIETY - FRESHNESS - FAST PACE - SENSATION & DEADLY INTENTIONSMost films from as far back as 1934 are hard to sit through and really show their age. 'THE THIN MAN' is an exception.It all starts out with chemistry, and William Powell as Nick Charles and Myrna Loy as his wife, Nora Charles certainly do have chemistry. Enough chemistry for a total of 6 'Thin Man' films between 1934-1947. Yes, the two always seem to be drinking and having cocktail parties, but this film was released at the bottom of the Depression in 1934, and less than a year after the end of prohibition. Gaiety must have seemed rather far removed from the average moviegoer of the time, so why not spend 90 minutes steeped in it.If one thinks back to 1934, one must remember that talking films were only around since 1929 and it was not a smooth transition from silent to sound pictures. However, one would never know it while watching 'The Thin Man' as the repartee between Nick Charles and Nora Charles is as fluid and provocative as any ever put to film.THERE IS MORE THAN JUST MR. & MRS. CHARLES -- THERE'S ASTA TOO!Asta, the terrier, co-stars, but there is a story to go along with the chemistry and nifty dialogue. It's fast-paced, full of sensations, false leads and deadly intentions and of course ---- lots and lots of martinis.THE DINNER TABLE 'WHODUNIT' WAS NOT A CLICHE IN 1934!Of course, after a whirlwind of rather laid-back action: dead bodies, interrogations and more dead bodies plus some more dialogue, we have everything that 'The Thin Man' has come to represent distilled into one climactic dinner scene, chaperoned by the police dressed as waiters. Our hosts for the evening are Mr. and Mrs. Charles and the crime is to be solved at the table, though we understand that Nick doesn't know who did it beforehand.*-----> THE PRINCIPAL PLAYERS &lt;-----*William Powell  - Nick CharlesMyrna Loy  - Nora CharlesMaureen O'Sullivan  - Dorothy WynantNat Pendleton  - Lt.

Perskie ""ceruleana""","[1, 2]","Nick and Nora Charles, the dynamite detective duo, became the stuff of legend after just one movie - one mystery thriller romantic comedy - ""The Thin Man!"" Adapted from the novel by Dashiell Hammet, (probably based on Hammett's relationship with Lillian Hellman), directed by W.S. Van Dyke, and released in 1934, the film had American audiences, weary from the Great Depression, clamoring for more crime solving by the debonair pair. Nick, a former PI, and Nora, the elegant society heiress, are now famous for their witty repartee, affectionate banter, ever-present cocktail in hand, and hang-over remedy at bedside. They are probably sleuthdom's most sophisticated couple - perhaps the most urbane twosome in all of romantic comedy. The chemistry and timing between Powell and Loy ignited the Silver Screen, just as it now  fires-up  the somewhat smaller screens of our TV/PC monitors. And lest we forget, Skippy, (the dog), plays Asta, their Wire-Haired Fox Terrier.Nick has decided to retire from the detecting business in order to manage Nora's abundant finances. The couple are in New York City for the Christmas holidays and are temporarily residing in an apartment with a great view of the Manhattan skyline. The film focuses on the Charles' relationship, with an emphasis on shenanigans, wisecracking, and vodka martini sipping, while the mystery and murders take a back seat. When Clyde Wynant, a wealthy and eccentric inventor, and  the ""thin man"" from the movie's title,  disappears, his daughter Dorothy, an old family friend, asks Nick to find him. After a few dead bodies surface, the police suspect the missing Wynant of multiple murder. Nora urges Nick to discover Mr. Wynant's whereabouts, and figure-out whodunit!

The reason I shy away from old films is because I often feel like some key element hasn't been fully explained, which makes it hard to get into the movie.  That happened a time or two here, but for the most part everything was fairly straight forward, at least as far as the backgrounds went.I had pieces of the mystery figured out before the characters did, but I still enjoyed the story.

287769,A152C8GYY25HAH,6301978420,Matthew Horner,"[14, 17]","""The Thin Man"" was released in 1934 and spawned five sequels. Boxoffice grosses for individual movies from those days are hard to come by, but one can assume that ""The Thin Man"" was a hugely profitable hit for MGM. Sequels were quite rare in those days - the only other ones I can think of offhand are the ""Andy Hardy"" films. Studios, which also owned most of the first-run movie houses, concentrated on fresh product, only occasionally remaking a particularly successful film.What drives ""The Thin Man"" is the absolutely brilliant script by Albert Hackett and Francis Goodrich. It is based on a novel by Dashiell Hammett, but the screenplay stands on it own as one of the best [and funniest] ever written. The dialog is so rapid-fire that, even after repeated viewings, I always catch clever lines I missed before.William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles make a fantastic couple - smart, witty, and oh-so-worldly. They remain surprisingly modern because they are on equal footing in every area. In fact, they are more equal than most couples in modern movies. The relationship is a little hard for me to describe. Their relationship is not based on romantic love, but on something deeper, more complex. You simply have to see the movie to understand it.Not surprisingly, ""The Thin Man"" is the best in the series, although the second film, ""Another Thin Man"", which was also written by Hackett and Aldrich, comes very close to being as good. Both were directed by W.S. Van Dyke.

Nick was a working class hard-drinking private detective before he married blue-blooded Nora. But now Nick is enjoying his retirement and is reluctant to get involved in any mysteries. Nora, on the other hand, is intrigued by Nick's old line of work and welcomes the excitement that detective work might bring to her life. But Nick stubbornly refuses to take the case, even when the missing man's secretary is murdered and his lawyer and ex-wife express their concern as well. But when a gun-wielding thug forces his way into the Charles' apartment and the police harass him for answers, Nick is left with little choice but to take the case of ""the thin man"". Believing that the police are on the wrong trail entirely, Nick returns to Clyde Wynant's closed-up shop, where he finds an essential clue to his disappearance. Nick then decides that the best way to ferret out the culprit is to invite all of the suspects and interested parties to a dinner party at his apartment where he will lay out the story as he knows it and set up the murderer in the presence of the police.""The Thin Man"" was adapted from the popular 1933 detective novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett and directed by W.S. Van Dyke in 1934. Although fans of Dashiell Hammet's hard-boiled whodunit may not recognize the Nick and Nora Charles of the silver screen, ""The Thin Man"" impresses me as one of the best adapted screenplays in cinematic history. Screenwriters Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich have brilliantly adapted Dashiell Hammet's novel for a mainstream audience. The story has been simplified considerably. But, more significantly, the movie's characters have been made more likable and respectable than those of the book, and somewhat less alcoholic. Although Hammett's novel is full of witty quips, it is far too cynical to be called a comedy. Screenwriters Hackett and Goodrich chose to make the film a comedy of manners and de-emphasized the mystery in favor of Nick and Nora's relationship. That decision, along with the casting of William Powell and Myrna Loy, who have such great comic chemistry and affection between them, made ""The Thin Man"" so irresistible to audiences in the 1930's that it supported an impressive 6-film franchise over the course of 13 years. William Powell and Myrna Loy's appeal has not diminished in the least to this day. There has never been a funnier party scene than the Charles' wonderful drunken Christmas party. And an expanded role for the Charles' irrepressible pooch Asta perfectly tops off the comedy. ""The Thin Man"" is a wonderfully entertaining  combination of mystery, comedy, and romance set in the glamourous world of upper-class Manhattan in the 1930's. It's as good as popular movie-making gets. ""The Thin Man"" of course  refers to the missing Mr. Wynant, although the phrase came to be associated with Nick Charles in the subsequent ""Thin Man"" films.We can only hope that eventually all of ""The Thin Man"" movies will be available as a DVD boxed set with some nice extras. If you like ""The Thin Man"" and old comedy/ mystery/romance movies appeal to you, you might like Alfred Hitchcock's 1938 film ""The Lady Vanishes"". It is a lighthearted, utterly charming film, and one of Hitchcock's best, that manages to successfully combine even more genres than ""The Thin Man"" does.",5,"Mystery, Comedy, Romance, Glamour....All in One Perfect Film",1059004800,"07 24, 2003",2003,3643,"['Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'have', 'recently', 'moved', 'back', 'New', 'York', 'West', 'Coast', 'are', 'looking', 'forward', 'time', 'together', 'when', 'old', 'acquaintance', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Dorothy', 'Wynant', 'Maureen', ""O'Sullivan"", 'Nick', 'help', 'locating', 'father', 'inventor', 'named', 'Clyde', 'Wynant', 'Edward', 'Ellis', 'Nick', 'was', 'working', 'class', 'hard-drinking', 'private', 'detective', 'married', 'blue-blooded', 'Nora', 'now', 'Nick', 'enjoying', 'retirement', 'reluctant', 'get', 'involved', 'mysteries', 'Nora', 'other', 'hand', 'intrigued', 'Nick', 'old', 'line', 'work', 'excitement', 'detective', 'work', 'might', 'bring', 'life', 'Nick', 'stubbornly', 'take', 'case', 'even', 'when', 'missing', 'man', 'secretary', 'murdered', 'lawyer', 'ex-wife', 'express', 'concern', 'well', 'when', 'gun-wielding', 'thug', 'forces', 'way', 'Charles', 'apartment', 'police', 'harass', 'answers', 'Nick', 'left', 'little', 'choice', 'take', 'case', 'thin', 'man', 'Believing', 'police', 'are', 'wrong', 'trail', 'entirely', 'Nick', 'Clyde', 'Wynant', 'closed-up', 'shop', 'where', 'essential', 'clue', 'disappearance', 'Nick', 'then', 'best', 'way', 'ferret', 'out', 'culprit', 'invite', 'suspects', 'interested', 'parties', 'dinner', 'party', 'apartment', 'where', 'will', 'lay', 'out', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'murderer', 'presence', 'police', 'Thin', 'Man', 'was', 'adapted', 'popular', '1933', 'detective', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'directed', 'W.S', 'Van', 'Dyke', '1934', 'fans', 'Dashiell', 'Hammet', 'hard-boiled', 'whodunit', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'silver', 'screen', 'Thin', 'Man', 'one', 'best', 'adapted', 'screenplays', 'cinematic', 'history', 'Screenwriters', 'Albert', 'Hackett', 'Frances', 'Goodrich', 'have', 'brilliantly', 'adapted', 'Dashiell', 'Hammet', 'novel', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'story', 'been', 'simplified', 'considerably', 'more', 'significantly', 'movie', 'characters', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'more', 'likable', 'respectable', 'book', 'somewhat', 'less', 'alcoholic', 'Hammett', 'novel', 'full', 'witty', 'quips', 'far', 'too', 'cynical', 'be', 'called', 'comedy', 'Screenwriters', 'Hackett', 'Goodrich', 'chose', 'make', 'film', 'comedy', 'manners', 'de-emphasized', 'mystery', 'favor', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'relationship', 'decision', 'casting', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'who', 'have', 'such', 'great', 'comic', 'chemistry', 'affection', 'made', 'Thin', 'Man', 'so', 'irresistible', 'audiences', '1930', 'supported', 'impressive', '6-film', 'franchise', 'course', '13', 'years', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'appeal', 'not', 'diminished', 'least', 'day', 'never', 'been', 'funnier', 'party', 'scene', 'Charles', 'wonderful', 'drunken', 'Christmas', 'party', 'expanded', 'role', 'Charles', 'irrepressible', 'pooch', 'Asta', 'perfectly', 'comedy', 'Thin', 'Man', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'combination', 'mystery', 'comedy', 'romance', 'set', 'glamourous', 'world', 'upper-class', 'Manhattan', '1930', 'as', 'good', 'popular', 'movie-making', 'Thin', 'Man', 'course', 'refers', 'missing', 'Mr.', 'Wynant', 'phrase', 'came', 'be', 'associated', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'subsequent', 'Thin', 'Man', 'films.We', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'eventually', 'Thin', 'Man', 'movies', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'nice', 'extras', 'like', 'Thin', 'Man', 'old', 'comedy/', 'mystery/romance', 'movies', 'appeal', 'might', 'like', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', '1938', 'film', 'Lady', 'Vanishes', 'lighthearted', 'utterly', 'charming', 'film', 'one', 'Hitchcock', 'best', 'successfully', 'combine', 'even', 'more', 'genres', 'Thin', 'Man']",N/A

The answer is ""Asta,"" a good four-letter word for puzzles as it has common letters and can fit where it's needed.  But who is Asta?  He is the canine companion of Nick and Nora Charles, the principal characters in The Thin Man, a pleasant 1930s mystery movie.William Powell is Nick Charles, a former detective who is now retired, having married Nora, who besides beautiful and witty, is also the heir to a great fortune.  Now, the happy couple prefer to indulge in endless partying, usually involving copious amounts of alcohol.  (This film was made in an era when characters could imbibe liquor like water and never suffer anything more serious than a mild headache.)  For Nick, getting involved in a murder mystery is more of a distraction than anything he is really motivated to solve; eventually, however, when he thinks the wrong man is accused - and when it appears that no one will leave him alone otherwise - he takes the case.For the most part, the mystery itself is incidental to watching Nick and Nora banter and Asta up to his (or is it her?) tricks.  Nora, happily, is no shrinking violet who screams at every peril; even when the couple is in danger, they react more with amusement than fear.Even for a movie that is seven decades old, The Thin Man continues to amuse.

Some of the dialogue is a bit dated as well, enough to make a viewer chuckle.

But that's the couple itself, as it exists on paper.  It's the actors who truly bring them to life.  They just have so much fun together onscreen! Watch carefully the wordless physical exchange between them while McCauley (sp?) is on the phone at their apartment.  Notice the way Loy screws her nose up when Powell shoots her an amused look while Maureen O'Sullivan is crying on his shoulder.  Just the affectionate way they address each other...you can't pretend with such things.  They obviously adored each other in real life, and it was a bit of genius to pair them in this series.  They make it worth watching over and over.

287785,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6301978420,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 2]","The Thin Man (W. S. van Dyke, 1934)I first saw The Thin Man about a decade ago, when I was as much of a lush as Nick and Nora Charles, and at the time I was relatively unimpressed with it; if you take it just for the sake of its plot, it's a modest little mystery flick without much going for it, and it contains one of the things that drives me to madness in mystery films--that scene at the end where the detective gathers everyone into a room and then announces that the murder is in this very room, and starts talking about how he unraveled the mystery. Man, I hate that. It's the good-guy version of the evil genius pausing to explain to the hero how he's going to conquer the world, giving the hero time to escape and brain the evil genius with a piece of handy electrical equipment, thus saving the planet. This time around, however, my mind is a touch clearer, and I get that van Dyke was probably as annoyed with that particular Agatha Christie trope as I am; he plays with it, subverts it in a way that takes it dangerously close to genius, though I can't find it in myself to consider that last scene any less annoying now than I did then. I also missed a lot of what contemporary audiences saw as the charm of the film, which is the interplay between Nick and Nora Charles themselves. I attribute this to what most sober people are well aware of--it's always funner to laugh at the drunk guy than to actually be the drunk guy. Unless, of course, you're Nick Charles, the epitome of the debonair drunk.The action opens with eccentric inventor Claude Wynant (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang's Edward Ellis) packing up and heading off to a conference, promising his winsome daughter Dorothy (Maureen O'Sullivan, who will, embarrassingly, probably be remembered for playing Jane in Johnny Weissmuller's many, many Tarzan movies) and her earnest fiance Tommy (Mark of the Vampire's Henry Wadsworth) that he'll be back in time for the wedding. The wedding rolls around, and Wynant's nowhere to be found. Time goes by, and still no one's seen Wynant. Then his girlfriend, Julia Wolf (Heart of Arizona's Natalie Moorehead) turns up dead, and there's evidence linking Wynant to the murder. Soon after, Wynant's ex-wife Mimi's new husband goes missing. Dorothy begs Nick Charles (William Powell), a retired detective now living the good life as a playboy with his socialite wife Nora (Myrna Loy), to prove his old friend Claude's innocence. Nick initially refuses, but after much badgering from his wife, he takes the case, solving it in roughly the time it would take you to make a sandwich if you got up and left the room at that point.Van Dyke directed almost one hundred films during his career (including the first of Weissmuller's Tarzan films and two of the five Thin Man sequels), but this was his only Best Director Oscar nomination for a movie he was actually credited with directing. (He was uncredited on the film that earned him his second Best Director nomination, ironically--1936's San Francisco. It is equally ironic that in both cases, he lost to Frank Capra.) Given the weakness of the plot, either you have to give the Academy even less credit than you normally should, or there's something else going on here. A quick look through van Dyke's movies contemporary to this may give it away; Manhattan Melodrama, Broadway Melody of 1936, etc. Van Dyke as a mystery director? Preposterous, and the film bears that out. Van Dyke as a chronicler of glitzy New York social life? Now you're onto something. Think of him as the thirties version of anyone who casts Paris Hilton in a movie, and you've hit the nail on the head. The difference, of course, is that van Dyke here hires actors, and very good ones, to play socialites instead of the other way around. It's his portrayals of Nick and Nora's daily life that make this movie worth watching; the chemistry between them is as real as it is for actual married couples who happen to be filthy rich and constantly drunk. (Or, at least, one assumes, having never actually lived on the Main Line.) Myrna Loy, the striking beauty (perhaps second only to Lillian Gish) with the wicked acting chops, may be the finest American actress to have never garnered a single Academy Award nomination; it doesn't matter how bad the movie, Myrna Loy brought her A game to the table. Ironically, Powell, who was nominated for Best Actor three times (here, My Man Godfrey, and Life with Father), was never better than when interacting onscreen with Loy. As a mystery film, it's a failure; as a character study of Nick and Nora Charles, it's delightful. *** ",4,Great character study.

287788,A10Q8NIFOVOHFV,6301978420,Robert S. Clay Jr.,"[14, 14]","This classic detective film also qualifies as a classic comedy.  The slick repartee between Nick and Nora Charles is the stuff of screen legend.  A good example of the irreverent humor is the hilarious Christmas Eve party.  The ribald revelry of the guests is a biting contrast to the heavy-duty sentiment of more traditional Christmas movies (e.g., &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;) that get misty-eyed over Christmas Eve, home and family, etc.  As every true fan knows, the mystery story plot is a mere excuse for all the fun.  Nick (William Powell) is witty and sophisticated, but stays in touch with his working class roots.  He is an iron fist in a velvet glove.  Nora (Myrna Loy) has the chutzpah to keep pace, and even exceed, Nick's grit and razor-sharp wit.  Theirs is a true marriage of equals.  One of the themes of the series is that marriage can be fun.  Contrast that with the old ball-and-chain cliche and pass the traditional values, please.  Nora has more snappy comebacks than Groucho and Chico.  When the cops find an illegal gun in the Charles' hotel suite, they ask Nick if he has heard of the Sullivan Law.  Nora pipes up and says, &quot;Oh, its all right.  We're married!&quot;  As a heavy-handed policeman goes through their dresser, she asks, &quot;What is that man doing in my drawers?&quot;  By this point, the viewer has forgotten there is a genuine murder mystery in progress.  The film is as fresh and vibrant today as it was 70 years ago.

Myrna Loy and William Powell as Nick and Nora Charles are the perfect married couple. Both charming, witty, rich and stylish. They banter back and forth hurling barbs and compliments at each other with equal ease. Their relationship defies every expectation for a movie couple.  He drinks too much. Yet when she suspiciously asks how much he has been drinking, when he says five shots, rather than getting upset she tells the bartender to line up five shots neat so she can catch up.  When Nora walks in on Nick in their bedroom holding a beautiful woman in her arms, rather than storm out hurt or shocked they begin making funny faces at each other.  How can you not love this?But there is something else in this movie that goes almost unnoticed in every commentary about this film. The gorgeous photography aided at every turn by the brilliant equally stylish character casting and costuming. There are rules artists use in laying out tones of black and white on dark grays and light grays to make an image really pop. Whomever was in charge of the cinematography understood these rules like a master. Every shot is gorgeous. Every turn of the camera is a jewel. You could do a screen capture of any frame and view it as a textbook study in use of diagonals, shadows, lighting, dynamic eyelines focusing the audience on the most important part of the image. Intellectualizing it isn't helpful because the net result is some of the most fun imagery ever captured. But if you do take the time to notice it you will marvel at how clever they were in making this movie.The DVD is very good quality but only contains a minimum of extras. The only real extra is trailers for each of the ""Thin Man"" films. The most entertaining is the first for ""The Thin Man"" where William Powell has a conversation with himself as Nick Charles standing in the cover of a giant replica of the Dashell Hammet book.

The story revolves around a man who used to be a detective (William Powell) who finds himself roped into helping police with a triple murder case. His wife (Myrna Loy) turns out to be a great help as well as the family dog Asta.The story can be a bit confusing at times if you're not good with names and are not familiar with the actors on the screen because there are so many people involved in the story. However, it is a great thrill to try to figure out who the murderer is along the way; you probably won't figure it out. If you're not a big fan of murder mysteries, you still might like this film because of its humor and elements of romance. This is no film noir thriller; it contains much more comedy than darkness.William Powell is excellent in the film. His character is nonchalantly confident and never buckles under pressure which leads to some greatly subtly funny scenes and some great one-liners.This DVD is the first of the collection of six films.

287796,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,6301978420,Scott Schiefelbein,"[1, 1]","""The Thin Man"" charms you with its innocence and its humor, and its clever writing keeps you in stitches.  A pedestrian murder mystery, based on the classic novel by Dashiell Hammett, gets turbocharged by the timeless performances of William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, America's booziest high-class couple.Filmed in 1934, ""The Thin Man"" shows what the old Hollywood studio system could achieve when all the right elements came together.  Shockingly, director W.S. ""One Take"" Van Dyke filmed this movie in twelve days, and the movie has a bit of a slapdash, last-minute feel that perfectly suits the two lead characters.  Indeed, Nick spends the first half of the film trying to convince everyone that he's not interested in what's going on.  Later, he laments that the murder mystery he's investigating is eating into his drinking.  Still, Loy and Powell have such magical chemistry together -- and perfect comic timing -- that everything just clicks.The murder is almost a McGuffin -- an elderly scientist, the titular ""thin man,"" goes missing and is suspected in a rash of murders.  Nick Charles, a retired detective with a solid reputation, would rather host parties and drink himself silly with his lovely young (and fabulously wealthy) bride Nora than get involved.  And yet everyone is pounding on his door, including both cops and criminals, desperate to get Nick on the case.  Armed with a case of scotch, the terrier Asta, and a sharp mind honed to lethal perfection by hours of boozing, Nick eventually solves the crime in hilarious fashion.Part of the movie's charm is its ability to walk just on the safe side of the rigid moral codes applicable to films at the time.  Nick and Nora may sleep in separate twin beds, but it's clear that they spend a lot of time in the sack.  As a cop asks them when he finds a hidden gun, ""Have you ever heard of the Sullivan Act?""  Nora replies, ""That's alright -- we're married.""  This was the height of risque in films of the day, and Loy and Powell make it work magnificently.Get this movie, pour yourself a pitcher of your favorite cocktails, and dive right in - you'll be hooked.",5,"Hilarious, drunken high-class detective tale -- a classic's classic",1150761600,"06 20, 2006",2006,2150,"['Thin', 'Man', 'innocence', 'humor', 'clever', 'writing', 'keeps', 'stitches', 'pedestrian', 'murder', 'mystery', 'based', 'classic', 'novel', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'turbocharged', 'timeless', 'performances', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'America', 'booziest', 'high-class', 'couple.Filmed', '1934', 'Thin', 'Man', 'what', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'system', 'could', 'achieve', 'when', 'right', 'elements', 'came', 'together', 'Shockingly', 'director', 'W.S', 'One', 'Take', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'filmed', 'movie', 'twelve', 'days', 'movie', 'bit', 'slapdash', 'last-minute', 'feel', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Indeed', 'Nick', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'trying', 'convince', 'everyone', 'not', 'interested', 'what', 'going', 'Later', 'murder', 'mystery', 'investigating', 'eating', 'drinking', 'Still', 'Loy', 'Powell', 'have', 'such', 'magical', 'chemistry', 'together', 'perfect', 'comic', 'timing', 'everything', 'just', 'clicks.The', 'murder', 'almost', 'McGuffin', 'elderly', 'scientist', 'titular', 'thin', 'man', 'missing', 'suspected', 'rash', 'murders', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'retired', 'detective', 'solid', 'reputation', 'would', 'rather', 'host', 'parties', 'drink', 'silly', 'lovely', 'young', 'fabulously', 'wealthy', 'Nora', 'get', 'involved', 'yet', 'everyone', 'pounding', 'door', 'including', 'cops', 'criminals', 'desperate', 'get', 'Nick', 'case', 'Armed', 'case', 'scotch', 'terrier', 'Asta', 'sharp', 'mind', 'honed', 'lethal', 'perfection', 'hours', 'boozing', 'Nick', 'eventually', 'crime', 'hilarious', 'fashion.Part', 'movie', 'charm', 'ability', 'walk', 'just', 'safe', 'side', 'rigid', 'moral', 'codes', 'applicable', 'films', 'time', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'may', 'sleep', 'separate', 'twin', 'beds', 'clear', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'sack', 'cop', 'when', 'hidden', 'gun', 'Have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Sullivan', 'Act', 'Nora', 'replies', 'alright', ""'re"", 'married', 'was', 'height', 'risque', 'films', 'day', 'Loy', 'Powell', 'make', 'work', 'magnificently.Get', 'movie', 'pour', 'pitcher', 'favorite', 'cocktails', 'dive', 'right', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hooked']",N/A

It's putting me way behind in my drinking.""""The Thin Man"" is a film whose style makes a more lasting impression than its substance. William Powell and Myrna Loy plays Nick and Nora Charles, a husband and wife duo who enjoy two things in life: verbally sparring with each other and having another drink. Both Nick and Nora are quite content in their routine but matters change when former detective Nick is asked to come out of retirement. Apparently an inventor (Edward Ellis) has vanished and his daughter (Maureen O'Sullivan) is anxious to find him. The inventor's former wife (Minna Goimbell), her slimy current husband (Cesar Romero), the inventor's mistress (Natalie Moorhead), and other assorted lowlifes become the suspects in the disappearance. Charles dutifully investigates each of these characters in turn and exposes the culprit during an inspired dinner gathering sequence. However, the shining grace of ""The Thin Man"" is the interplay between Powell and Loy. Both performers excel at setting up the other for the quick and clever verbal comeback while also making sure to get in their fair share of quips. As the film unfolds, you actually find yourself more caught up in the war of words between the two leads rather than their efforts to solve the mystery at the center of the film. While amusing, this is the one factor that works against ""The Thin Man"". The back-and-forth between Powell and Loy is so strong that it completely overshadows the film's story. When you're finished watching, all you remember is the wonderful time you had with Mr. and Mrs. Charles - you would be hard pressed to recount most of the details of their investigation. Now this is not a bad thing because the film still is great entertainment, it just feels a little unbalanced. The bottom line is that ""The Thin Man"" is bubbling over with so much charm that it will still leave you giddy even with its shortcomings.

Nick and Nora are in New York for Christmas and find themselves having to investigate and eventually solve several murders.The chemistry between the two stars is what makes these movies.  It would seem as if they really were married.  The Thin Man is outrageously funny with a lot of sexual innuendo which was certainly outrageous for the time period.The movies are always filled with great character actors.  Those faces you know even if you don't know the names.  The dialog sparkles as the two drink their way through solving the crimes.  honestly, being drunk has never been this funny.Some may feel that it glamorizes alcohol, but lets remember that this was the early 1930's.  The Christmas party in their posh hotel room is priceless.My only complaint is that it seems there are little in the way of extras on the DVD.  What a shame.  While outtakes may not still exist, certainly some interviews and commentary with film historians would have been a welcome addition.  Still..these are a definite add to your collection",5,BETTER THAN 5 STARS,1066694400,"10 21, 2003",2003,1430,"['Thin', 'Man', 'first', 'series', 'six', 'movies', 'starring', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'wealthy', 'socialites', 'detectives', 'movies', 'made', '1934', '1947', 'comprise', 'six', '13', 'collaborations', 'two', 'stars', 'certainly', 'most', 'famous', 'work.I', 'can', 'not', 'rave', 'strongly', 'enough', 'movies', 'particularly', 'first', 'best', 'series', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'are', 'New', 'York', 'Christmas', 'find', 'having', 'investigate', 'eventually', 'solve', 'several', 'murders.The', 'chemistry', 'two', 'stars', 'what', 'movies', 'would', 'seem', 'really', 'were', 'married', 'Thin', 'Man', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'lot', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'was', 'certainly', 'outrageous', 'time', 'period.The', 'movies', 'are', 'always', 'filled', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'know', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'names', 'dialog', 'two', 'drink', 'way', 'solving', 'crimes', 'honestly', 'being', 'drunk', 'never', 'been', 'funny.Some', 'may', 'feel', 'alcohol', 'remember', 'was', 'early', '1930', 'Christmas', 'party', 'posh', 'hotel', 'room', 'priceless.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'are', 'little', 'way', 'extras', 'DVD', 'What', 'shame', 'outtakes', 'may', 'not', 'still', 'exist', 'certainly', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'film', 'historians', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'welcome', 'addition', 'Still..these', 'are', 'definite', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Van Dyke and starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles.Nick Charles, a retired but still famous detective is vacationing in Christmastime NYC with his wife Nora and their dog, Asta.  Nora Charles has money and they are  both  enjoying a rather extravagent vacation--especially considering that this is the depths of the Depression--when an old friend of Nick's, a scientist named Wynant, disappears.Nick really wants nothing to do with the mystery but when Wynant's daughter appeals to him for help he just can't refuse.  And once things get moving Nora and even Asta get involved in this confusing but involving case.  The story is told with a great deal of humor and wit, the back and forth accusations get a little silly sometimes but, especially considering that this is about a missing friend, the light touch workslike in no other movie  of this type.The interaction between Nick and Nora, and sometimes the supporting characters isdelightful and it usually advances the plot but after a while the viewer is more interested in the relationship between the two principals than the mysteries surrounding them.A wonderful film, suitable for enjoyment by just about everybody. This DVD edition has the trailers for all six THIN MAN films as an extra feature and has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. I'm sure that THE THIN MAN wil be enjoyed by everyone who sees it.",5,Debut Of The Thin Man,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,1509,"['revue', 'WB', 'DVD', 'release', 'MGM', '1934', 'classic', 'THE', 'THIN', 'MAN', 'directedby', 'W.S', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'starring', 'William', 'Powell', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles.Nick', 'Charles', 'retired', 'still', 'famous', 'detective', 'vacationing', 'Christmastime', 'NYC', 'wife', 'Nora', 'dog', 'Asta', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'money', 'are', 'enjoying', 'rather', 'extravagent', 'vacation', 'especially', 'considering', 'depths', 'Depression', 'when', 'old', 'friend', 'Nick', 'scientist', 'named', 'Wynant', 'disappears.Nick', 'really', 'nothing', 'do', 'mystery', 'when', 'Wynant', 'daughter', 'appeals', 'help', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'once', 'things', 'get', 'moving', 'Nora', 'even', 'Asta', 'get', 'involved', 'confusing', 'involving', 'case', 'story', 'told', 'great', 'deal', 'humor', 'wit', 'back', 'forth', 'accusations', 'get', 'little', 'silly', 'sometimes', 'especially', 'considering', 'missing', 'friend', 'light', 'touch', 'workslike', 'other', 'movie', 'type.The', 'interaction', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'sometimes', 'supporting', 'characters', 'isdelightful', 'usually', 'plot', 'viewer', 'more', 'interested', 'relationship', 'two', 'principals', 'mysteries', 'surrounding', 'them.A', 'wonderful', 'film', 'suitable', 'enjoyment', 'just', 'everybody', 'DVD', 'edition', 'trailers', 'six', 'THIN', 'MAN', 'films', 'extra', 'feature', 'subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', ""'m"", 'sure', 'THE', 'THIN', 'MAN', 'wil', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'everyone', 'who']",N/A

Fuller,"[12, 14]","&quot;The Thin man&quot; is the first in a series of highly successful films portraying Dashiell Hammett's most amusing detective duo, Nick and Nora Charles; and their dog, Asta.William Powell plays Nick Charles, a semi retired detective who finds enjoyment out of drinking and trying to out wit his wife, Nora, played splendedly by Myrna Loy.  Nick is committed, as he is in all the &quot;Thin Man&quot; movies, to retirement from the detective business.  However, something always comes up, and he is dragged back in.  Nora is committed to keeping her wayward husband in the crime business, if only so that she might get in on the fun of solving the mystery herself.  And, as in all the &quot;Thin Man&quot; movies, there is more comedy than drama.In &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, a business man mysteriously disappears, and is not heard from again, except by way of phone by his business associate.  This man is dubbed &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, which is where the genesis of the title is derived.  Many people still believe the title refers to Nick Charles himself, but not so.  The thin man's daughter becomes worried, knowing it is uncharacteristic of her father to be absent so long, without contacting her.Nick and Nora happen to be friends with the missing man's daughter, and her fience'.  She begs Nick to help her find out what has happened to her father, much to Nick's initial disapproval.  However, he snoops around, much to Nora's chagrin,and soon they both are deeply embroiled in this mystery, though, as usual, more by Nora's doing than Nick's.After some sleuthing, Nick discovers a large amount of money is missing from the business; stolen, no doubt.  And when he finds the skeletal remains of a body buried in the basement of the thin man's establishment, he begins to suspect foul play.  Now, things are adding up.The thin man has embezelled money from his own company, murdered his accomplice in the crime, or perhaps somebody who might have found out what he was doing, and then fled the scene under a false pretense.  He keeps in close contact with his business associate under another false pretense, probably to find out how the business is doing while he is away, but really to gather news about the stolen money, and whether or not the body has been found.Yet, when various clues start coming in, this scenerio quickly dissolves from the trained and experienced mind of Nick Charles for that of something more sinister, more dark, and more deeply compelling.The film's success is do more in part to Nick and Nora's constant back and forth quips, as well as the wacky underworld characters rounded up as suspects, than the plot itself.  As well, the one mainstream to this series is the gathering of all the suspects in one room together, where Nick always manages to produce the guilty party after a slip of the tongue.I really enjoy watching &quot;The Thin man&quot;, and all the movies in the &quot;Thin Man&quot; series.  The comedy is engrossing, as is the way in which Nick goes about solving the crime, and the way Nora always manages to get in the way, but still be of help.",5,"Charming, Witty, and Vastly Entertaining Comedy-Mystery",1005868800,"11 16, 2001",2001,3106,"['quot', 'Thin', 'man', 'quot', 'first', 'series', 'highly', 'successful', 'films', 'portraying', 'Dashiell', 'Hammett', 'most', 'amusing', 'detective', 'duo', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'Charles', 'dog', 'Asta.William', 'Powell', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'semi', 'retired', 'detective', 'who', 'enjoyment', 'drinking', 'trying', 'out', 'wit', 'wife', 'Nora', 'played', 'splendedly', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Nick', 'committed', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Man', 'quot', 'movies', 'retirement', 'detective', 'business', 'However', 'something', 'always', 'up', 'dragged', 'back', 'Nora', 'committed', 'keeping', 'wayward', 'husband', 'crime', 'business', 'only', 'so', 'might', 'get', 'fun', 'solving', 'mystery', 'herself', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Man', 'quot', 'movies', 'more', 'comedy', 'drama.In', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Man', 'quot', 'business', 'man', 'mysteriously', 'not', 'heard', 'again', 'way', 'phone', 'business', 'associate', 'man', 'dubbed', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Man', 'quot', 'where', 'genesis', 'title', 'derived', 'Many', 'people', 'still', 'believe', 'title', 'refers', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'not', 'so', 'thin', 'man', 'daughter', 'worried', 'knowing', 'uncharacteristic', 'father', 'be', 'absent', 'so', 'long', 'contacting', 'her.Nick', 'Nora', 'happen', 'be', 'friends', 'missing', 'man', 'daughter', 'fience', 'begs', 'Nick', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'father', 'much', 'Nick', 'initial', 'disapproval', 'However', 'around', 'much', 'Nora', 'chagrin', 'soon', 'are', 'deeply', 'embroiled', 'mystery', 'though', 'usual', 'more', 'Nora', 'doing', ""Nick's.After"", 'sleuthing', 'Nick', 'large', 'amount', 'money', 'missing', 'business', 'stolen', 'doubt', 'when', 'skeletal', 'remains', 'body', 'buried', 'basement', 'thin', 'man', 'establishment', 'suspect', 'foul', 'play', 'Now', 'things', 'are', 'adding', 'up.The', 'thin', 'man', 'embezelled', 'money', 'own', 'company', 'murdered', 'accomplice', 'crime', 'perhaps', 'somebody', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'found', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'then', 'fled', 'scene', 'false', 'pretense', 'close', 'contact', 'business', 'associate', 'false', 'pretense', 'probably', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'business', 'doing', 'away', 'really', 'gather', 'news', 'stolen', 'money', 'not', 'body', 'been', 'found.Yet', 'when', 'various', 'clues', 'start', 'coming', 'scenerio', 'quickly', 'trained', 'experienced', 'mind', 'Nick', 'Charles', 'something', 'more', 'sinister', 'more', 'dark', 'more', 'deeply', 'compelling.The', 'film', 'success', 'do', 'more', 'part', 'Nick', 'Nora', 'constant', 'back', 'forth', 'quips', 'as', 'well', 'wacky', 'underworld', 'characters', 'rounded', 'up', 'suspects', 'plot', 'As', 'well', 'one', 'mainstream', 'series', 'gathering', 'suspects', 'one', 'room', 'together', 'where', 'Nick', 'always', 'produce', 'guilty', 'party', 'slip', 'tongue.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'quot', 'Thin', 'man', 'quot', 'movies', 'quot', 'Thin', 'Man', 'quot', 'series', 'comedy', 'engrossing', 'way', 'Nick', 'solving', 'crime', 'way', 'Nora', 'always', 'get', 'way', 'still', 'be', 'help']",N/A

Maybe something magical will happen, maybe you'll find yourself enthusiastically pushing something that's terrific, entertaining, civilized, funny-as-heck, and good for the world! And maybe the world will respond!Anyway...I wish I could give this ten stars! I can't say enough good things about this film and the whole series. Powell and Loy are incredible--most of my favorite lines in all film come from these movies (the rest are from Marx Bros. and W.C. Fields flicks). Powell has this almost Buddha-like comedic presence; somebody once called his comedy ""effortless."" This quality to his work actually improves and develops through the series to the point where by the last films his feet are barely touching the ground. And catch this guy's diction! My God, you don't hear the King's English spoken like this anywhere anymore!This is the ultimate in urbane, witty, and sophisticated dialogue. A fellow further down mentions his preference for this over current films. I agree. Watch this and the other five in the series and see what's been missing from film for too many years.[Aha! Maybe that's why they don't seem to want to release the rest of the series.
