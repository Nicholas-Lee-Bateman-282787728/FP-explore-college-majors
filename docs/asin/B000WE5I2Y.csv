1108876,A275CBNRP5RG1I,B000WE5I2Y,HiroNotHero,"[21, 21]","The blu-ray conversion of this very well executed vampire-related anime series. If you enjoy anime centering around vampires, like Hellsing or Vampire Hunter D, this series will be up your alley. Alright, here is the low down on this box set...VIDEO:The animation quality to this series is excellent. The studio who produced the animation, Gonzo, is known for skillfully blending CG animation and cell-shaded(hand drawn)animation. Both styles of animation blends very well in this one. The background artwork is very skillfully rendered and is beautiful. Nice variation of soft and bold colors. The character and mecha designs are very good as well. Overall, the animation as a whole is very pleasing to watch throughout the entire series. Anime in full HD is indeed a great thing and is how anime should be seen.AUDIO:The entire soundtrack to the series is excellent. The background music(BGM) fits in very well with the theme of the story and every situation that occurs. The opening and ending songs, which are vocal ones, are very good. I really like the opening song, Dress (bloody trinity mix), a lot. It is a gothic rock-style song which fits very well with the vampire theme of the show. As far as the sound effects, they are also done very well. The firing of a gun, the sound of an explosion, the acceleration of a airship, the crumbling of a building, and etc all sound like they should. Also, the spoken dialogue is recorded and reproduced in excellent quality. No scratchy, muffled, echoing, and etc quality spoken dialogue. In other words, it does not sound like the voice over work was recorded in a garbage can or metal shed.STORY/CHARACTERS:The storyline is very good and pulls you in. Not only is it about the relationship(struggles) between vampires and humankind, it is also about friendship, love, revenge, and self-discovery. Each character goes through his/her own trials and errors(which is mainly related to the rift between vampires and humans) and grows throughout the series. I found it very interesting to see progression of the two races' acceptance of and efforts to co-exist amongst one another. There is plenty of humor to tickle your funny bone, enough dramatic/emotional content to bring you back down to earth, and lots of action to amp you up. As for the characters, each one has his/her own unique personality, strengths, weaknesses, and skill(whether it be actual fighting/combat skills or more practical skills, like interpersonal communication and etc). Some are more memorable and likable than others, but for the most part, a fair number of the characters should have grown on you(one way or another) by the end of the series.",4,Solid vampire themed anime series,1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,2669,"['blu-ray', 'conversion', 'very', 'well', 'executed', 'vampire-related', 'anime', 'series', 'enjoy', 'anime', 'centering', 'around', 'vampires', 'Hellsing', 'Vampire', 'Hunter', 'D', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'up', 'alley', 'Alright', 'here', 'low', 'down', 'box', 'set', 'VIDEO', 'animation', 'quality', 'series', 'excellent', 'studio', 'who', 'produced', 'animation', 'Gonzo', 'known', 'skillfully', 'blending', 'CG', 'animation', 'cell-shaded', 'hand', 'drawn', 'animation', 'styles', 'animation', 'blends', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'background', 'artwork', 'very', 'skillfully', 'rendered', 'beautiful', 'Nice', 'variation', 'soft', 'bold', 'colors', 'character', 'mecha', 'designs', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'Overall', 'animation', 'whole', 'very', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'Anime', 'full', 'HD', 'indeed', 'great', 'thing', 'how', 'anime', 'should', 'be', 'seen.AUDIO', 'entire', 'soundtrack', 'series', 'excellent', 'background', 'music', 'BGM', 'very', 'well', 'theme', 'story', 'situation', 'opening', 'ending', 'songs', 'are', 'vocal', 'ones', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'really', 'opening', 'song', 'Dress', 'bloody', 'trinity', 'mix', 'lot', 'gothic', 'rock-style', 'song', 'very', 'well', 'vampire', 'theme', 'show', 'As', 'far', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'done', 'very', 'well', 'firing', 'gun', 'sound', 'explosion', 'acceleration', 'airship', 'crumbling', 'building', 'etc', 'sound', 'should', 'Also', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'recorded', 'reproduced', 'excellent', 'quality', 'scratchy', 'muffled', 'echoing', 'etc', 'quality', 'spoken', 'dialogue', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'sound', 'voice', 'work', 'was', 'recorded', 'garbage', 'can', 'metal', 'shed.STORY/CHARACTERS', 'storyline', 'very', 'good', 'pulls', 'Not', 'only', 'relationship', 'struggles', 'vampires', 'humankind', 'also', 'about', 'friendship', 'love', 'revenge', 'self-discovery', 'character', 'own', 'trials', 'errors', 'mainly', 'related', 'rift', 'vampires', 'humans', 'series', 'found', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'progression', 'two', 'races', 'acceptance', 'efforts', 'co-exist', 'amongst', 'one', 'plenty', 'humor', 'tickle', 'funny', 'bone', 'enough', 'dramatic/emotional', 'content', 'bring', 'back', 'down', 'earth', 'lots', 'action', 'amp', 'up', 'characters', 'one', 'his/her', 'own', 'unique', 'personality', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'skill', 'be', 'actual', 'fighting/combat', 'skills', 'more', 'practical', 'skills', 'interpersonal', 'communication', 'etc', 'are', 'more', 'memorable', 'likable', 'others', 'most', 'part', 'fair', 'number', 'characters', 'should', 'have', 'grown', 'one', 'way', 'end', 'series']",Trinity Blood

If you are impressed with the box you won' t be disappointed with the animation.The box set this comes in is about as nice as you can get IMHO. The only other box set I own that is nicer is the complete box set for Basilisk. The packaging is done with remarkable thoughtfulness. It almost reminds me of opening apple products, almost.The price is a bit heavy. But I think it balances itself out.If you like Trigun you will enjoy this. Though the humor is toned down and this tends to be a little darker. I see this as a cross between Crono Cruisade and Trigun.The story telling could have been a bit better but it was good overall.I would argue that they didn't really play items against each other well enough to really impact you.An example of this (slight spoiler): Someone has a love interest in the main character and she dies. The main character's mourning is TRIGGERED by the death of the beloved friend but is POWERED by his memories of someone else... how is that for an insensitive jerk!

McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[5, 17]","I feel like I'm watching Trigun all over again and this time I hate it.The one thing I hate about anime is that the keep recycling shows over and over again. Gundam copies from the previous series over and over again. All romance anime copy from each other. I know, I know most people who've watched enough anime already know this. I don't always have a problem with it.For example Gundam Seed, it copies the almost exact story line from the orginal Mobile Suit Gundam which came out over 20 years ago. I gave it a 8, it gave me a couple of new things to keep me watching. That's what I want from a show that almost copies everything from a differnt anime. Now to a show that doesn't. For example Gundam Seed Destiny. It compies everything from Moble Suit Gundam and Gundam Seed, and does the same thing in every episode with nothing new to the story. It also goes on for another 50 episodes, I mean come on. This show was a complete waste of time. That's why I gave it a 1.I just need to explain one of the reasons why I am giving Trinity Blood a 1. Trinity Blood is a rip off of Trigun. When Trigun came out in 1998 it was original anime. I've never seen anything like it before then. I gave it 5 stars, and even now it's one of the best anime I've seen, I still watch it at least once a year. Trinity Blood is just Trigun recycled eight years later. Able Nightroad is a exact copy of Vash. He acts the same and has the same past. I truly like the story of a kingdom of Vampires and humans living right beside each other. If they made a anime about that it could have been great, but instead they made it about Able aka Vash, and it turned into crap.

I sat down and watched the 1st four discs then had to get some sleep before work. The first few episodes are great then it slows down on the second disc and then picks back up on the third.The animation is good as is the story and the only things that I can complain about are...#1 Abel (the Priest) is kind of Clark Kent & Barney Fife rolled into one character for many episodes, until threatened. At first you perceive it as a cover for who he is but as it goes on it seems to be his real personna.#2 Abel does not become his signifcant other near enough. I think some episodes not at all.I got out of watching ANIME for many years and that style of character has always been around...the goofy type of person.There are episodes where they get away from Abel being a goof and he takes a much more serious approach to life. Which is a good thing.I think it could have been better but if something were to happen to my set...I would buy it again.My two complaints are very minor indeed..do not get my wrong. I really enjoy this...it is dark, sets a mood,good action and introduces new characters here and there so you never get bored with everybody is the same episode after episode.I have seen it 3 times.. it has great replay value. So far it is one of the best series that I have. Granted I only have 80 or so complete series yet out of what I have...Elfen Lied..Black Blood Brothers..several Gundams..Death Note..Last Exile.. Hellsing..Gunslinger Girl..Full Metal Panic/Alchemist..Jyu-Oh-sei and a multitude of others. This is in the top 3.Not to mention that the box itself is a thing of beauty..all discs have great work on them & the disc cases are very well done. I did not like the fact that they have 2 discs in each case. They put them one on top of the other instead of something like a thin pack where they will out one on each side of the case.Oh....also when I put in discs 3 & 4..they were not in surround sound.

1108896,AQR22MPF45M3P,B000WE5I2Y,Rachel Ford,"[0, 0]","I loved watching this, because, to me, it was amazing to see how the legends we grow up with look through the filter of a slightly different perspective. There is much that is absolutely amazing about this series -- the art, some of the characters, and the potential of this story -- and there is some that was not as good as it could have been. All in all, though, it was a highly enjoyable series.The story is as follows (spoilers):There are three races of humans:- Humans (Terrans): humans...- Methusalehs (Vampires): humans who need blood/blood substitute to survive. Vampire is an impolite term commonly employed by ""regular"" humans to denote this form of human. The Methusalehs have an extended life span and far greater power than common man. Methusalehs were created by humans experimenting on other humans.- Crusnik: humans who survive on the blood of vampires, Crusnik live longer even than vampires, and are far more powerful. They, too, were the result of human experimentation. There were only four created -- Abel Nightroad, and his three siblings, Cain, Seth and LilithThe main plot of the story is a struggle between Abel, and, on his side, the Church and humanity, and his brother (thought to be dead), Cain, and the clandestine Rosen Krutz Ordern. 900 years prior to the main story, as humanity broke into warring factions, the siblings chose different sides -- Lilith on the side of the Terrans, and the rest on the side of the vampires. Cain, after a life-saving operation turned him mad, murdered Lilith, and Seth and Abel in turn killed (they thought) Cain. Alas, but Cain ""undied"" a second time (not so, however, for poor Lilith who, once condemned to the grave, was condemned for all eternity). After Armageddon, and 900 years of mourning, Abel emerges, vowing to protect humans.The Pope -- a young, whiny boy who is easily bullied by his older brother -- resides in Rome; his chief advisers are his sister, who diligently strives to keep humanity on the right course, and his brother, who -- being himself barred by illegitimate birth from direct access to papal power -- effectively wields the power of the papacy through his younger sibling. Abel works for the sister as a member of her elite branch, the AX; he often finds himself at odds with the pope's brother's Inquisitors, however.A series of quests (many downright absurd) directs Abel to the truth of his brother's continued existence, and involvement with the Rosen Krutz Ordern. Along the way, he must confront his promise that he would never harm a human again and again (often choosing to indirectly cause thousands, perhaps millions, of deaths in order to directly maintain his vow). The same, however, is not true for vampires, whom he slaughters whenever the need arises. For these reasons, Abel's character can be very annoying at times, as he comes across as both spineless and stupid. While I get that he wants to protect humanity, as that was his dead sister's goal, the fact that vampires were a product of human experimentation - and are despised and persecuted by humans, despite the fact that they rely on a blood substitute and so [with the exception of rogue murderers] do not prey on humans  - seems to me to indicate that theirs is the more just side. But, Abel is Abel...Abel's work brings him in contact with many people, Terran and Methusaleh, as well as his sister, Seth (the Crusnik). These characters are generally very interesting, and add much to the story (although, again, some of them are stupid...as with Wendy and Peter, and the ""Tinkerbell System"" episode). One of the interesting characters is Esther Blanchette, Abel's human love interest; another is Count Ion Fortuna, his Methusaleh rival for Esther's hand. The most interesting quests in the series come probably half way through, when Abel is in contact with the New Human Empire (the kingdom of the Methusalehs).All in all, I give this series 4/5 stars. If not for some of the weaponry/quest-lines, which were beyond the level of absurdity acceptable even in fantasy, I would have given it 5/5...despite those, however, this was a very interesting anime series, full of complex characters and riveting episodes. Oh, and a final note...I highly recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles (if you don't speak the language)...the English dubbing was horrendous...",4,"Vampires, priests, and western legends, as you never knew them",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",2011,4355,"['loved', 'watching', 'because', 'was', 'amazing', 'see', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'look', 'filter', 'slightly', 'different', 'perspective', 'much', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'series', 'art', 'characters', 'potential', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'series.The', 'story', 'spoilers', 'are', 'three', 'races', 'humans', 'Humans', 'Terrans', 'humans', 'Methusalehs', 'Vampires', 'humans', 'who', 'need', 'blood/blood', 'substitute', 'survive', 'Vampire', 'impolite', 'term', 'commonly', 'employed', 'regular', 'humans', 'denote', 'form', 'human', 'Methusalehs', 'have', 'extended', 'life', 'span', 'far', 'greater', 'power', 'common', 'man', 'Methusalehs', 'were', 'created', 'humans', 'experimenting', 'other', 'humans.-', 'Crusnik', 'humans', 'who', 'survive', 'blood', 'vampires', 'Crusnik', 'live', 'longer', 'even', 'vampires', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'powerful', 'too', 'were', 'result', 'human', 'experimentation', 'were', 'only', 'four', 'created', 'Abel', 'Nightroad', 'three', 'siblings', 'Cain', 'Seth', 'LilithThe', 'main', 'plot', 'story', 'struggle', 'Abel', 'side', 'Church', 'humanity', 'brother', 'thought', 'be', 'dead', 'Cain', 'clandestine', 'Rosen', 'Krutz', 'Ordern', '900', 'years', 'prior', 'main', 'story', 'humanity', 'broke', 'warring', 'factions', 'siblings', 'chose', 'different', 'sides', 'Lilith', 'side', 'Terrans', 'rest', 'side', 'vampires', 'Cain', 'life-saving', 'operation', 'turned', 'mad', 'murdered', 'Lilith', 'Seth', 'Abel', 'turn', 'killed', 'thought', 'Cain', 'Alas', 'Cain', 'undied', 'second', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'however', 'poor', 'Lilith', 'who', 'once', 'condemned', 'grave', 'was', 'condemned', 'eternity', 'Armageddon', '900', 'years', 'mourning', 'Abel', 'vowing', 'protect', 'humans.The', 'Pope', 'young', 'whiny', 'boy', 'who', 'easily', 'bullied', 'older', 'brother', 'resides', 'Rome', 'chief', 'advisers', 'are', 'sister', 'who', 'diligently', 'keep', 'humanity', 'right', 'course', 'brother', 'who', 'being', 'barred', 'illegitimate', 'birth', 'direct', 'access', 'papal', 'power', 'effectively', 'power', 'papacy', 'younger', 'sibling', 'Abel', 'sister', 'member', 'elite', 'branch', 'AX', 'often', 'odds', 'pope', 'brother', 'Inquisitors', 'however.A', 'series', 'quests', 'many', 'downright', 'absurd', 'Abel', 'truth', 'brother', 'continued', 'existence', 'involvement', 'Rosen', 'Krutz', 'Ordern', 'way', 'must', 'confront', 'promise', 'would', 'never', 'harm', 'human', 'again', 'again', 'often', 'choosing', 'indirectly', 'cause', 'thousands', 'perhaps', 'millions', 'deaths', 'order', 'directly', 'maintain', 'vow', 'same', 'however', 'not', 'true', 'vampires', 'whom', 'whenever', 'need', 'reasons', 'Abel', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'annoying', 'times', 'spineless', 'stupid', 'get', 'protect', 'humanity', 'was', 'dead', 'sister', 'goal', 'fact', 'vampires', 'were', 'product', 'human', 'experimentation', 'are', 'despised', 'persecuted', 'humans', 'fact', 'rely', 'blood', 'substitute', 'so', '[', 'exception', 'rogue', 'murderers', ']', 'do', 'not', 'prey', 'humans', 'indicate', 'theirs', 'more', 'just', 'side', 'Abel', 'Abel', 'Abel', 'work', 'contact', 'many', 'people', 'Terran', 'Methusaleh', 'as', 'well', 'sister', 'Seth', 'Crusnik', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'very', 'interesting', 'add', 'much', 'story', 'again', 'are', 'stupid', 'Wendy', 'Peter', 'Tinkerbell', 'System', 'episode', 'One', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Esther', 'Blanchette', 'Abel', 'human', 'love', 'interest', 'Count', 'Ion', 'Fortuna', 'Methusaleh', 'rival', 'Esther', 'hand', 'most', 'interesting', 'quests', 'series', 'come', 'probably', 'way', 'when', 'Abel', 'contact', 'New', 'Human', 'Empire', 'kingdom', 'Methusalehs', '.All', 'give', 'series', '4/5', 'stars', 'not', 'weaponry/quest-lines', 'were', 'level', 'absurdity', 'acceptable', 'even', 'fantasy', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5/5', 'however', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'anime', 'series', 'full', 'complex', 'characters', 'riveting', 'episodes', 'Oh', 'final', 'note', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'Japanese', 'version', 'English', 'subtitles', 'do', ""n't"", 'speak', 'language', 'English', 'dubbing', 'was', 'horrendous']",Trinity Blood

The series shows us after in the near future after a worldwide man made calamity that the supernatural creatures known as vampires have returned to walk the earth again. The series also  has the Holy Roman Church as a near super power in the future to keep the vampires empire which is a similar super power in check.  The series has many characters that you will find very entertaining to watch one for me of course is the main character Abel Knightroad while a member of the special forces branch of the church he is also a more powerful vampire which feeds of other vampires which he will only do in dire combat, and also Father Leon Garcia who has a cocky attitude to the authority of the church and is not afraid to speak his mind no matter what.  The least likable character for the series in my opinion was the designated pope Alessandro XVIII his indecision and seemingly cravenness made him to unlikable to truly care for in my view, you always seem him having the final decision only when either his brother or sister force their choice onto him.  The series animation is great and the action is also incredible and while there isn't any true nudity for you to worry about young kids seeing the bloody fight scenes might be a little to much for young kids.  As always with the release of Funimation the English voice cast did superbly and as you expect the Japanese voice cast did superb for their characters as well.  So if you're a fan of vampires or liked the movies Vampire D this series might be a good choice for you to get...",5,An Interesting Storyline For the Vampire Anime Series,1231027200,"01 4, 2009",2009,1730,"[""'ve"", 'bought', 'series', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'seeing', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'reading', 'reviews', 'watching', 'series', 'found', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'series', 'near', 'future', 'worldwide', 'man', 'made', 'calamity', 'supernatural', 'creatures', 'known', 'vampires', 'have', 'returned', 'walk', 'earth', 'again', 'series', 'also', 'Holy', 'Roman', 'Church', 'near', 'super', 'power', 'future', 'keep', 'vampires', 'empire', 'similar', 'super', 'power', 'check', 'series', 'many', 'characters', 'will', 'find', 'very', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'one', 'course', 'main', 'character', 'Abel', 'Knightroad', 'member', 'special', 'forces', 'branch', 'church', 'also', 'more', 'powerful', 'vampire', 'feeds', 'other', 'vampires', 'will', 'only', 'do', 'dire', 'combat', 'also', 'Father', 'Leon', 'Garcia', 'who', 'cocky', 'attitude', 'authority', 'church', 'not', 'afraid', 'speak', 'mind', 'matter', 'what', 'least', 'likable', 'character', 'series', 'opinion', 'was', 'designated', 'pope', 'Alessandro', 'XVIII', 'indecision', 'seemingly', 'cravenness', 'made', 'unlikable', 'truly', 'care', 'view', 'always', 'seem', 'having', 'final', 'decision', 'only', 'when', 'brother', 'sister', 'force', 'choice', 'series', 'animation', 'great', 'action', 'also', 'incredible', ""n't"", 'true', 'nudity', 'worry', 'young', 'kids', 'seeing', 'bloody', 'fight', 'scenes', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'much', 'young', 'kids', 'always', 'release', 'Funimation', 'English', 'voice', 'cast', 'did', 'superbly', 'expect', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'cast', 'did', 'superb', 'characters', 'well', 'So', ""'re"", 'fan', 'vampires', 'liked', 'movies', 'Vampire', 'D', 'series', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'get']",Trinity Blood

1108900,A1KOHZ0JKRSDGY,B000WE5I2Y,Ron Harris,"[6, 7]","Here's the thing, this anime had great potential. I mean I was just ecstatic to finally get to watch it all since I didn't get to see much of it when it was on adult swim. Who can forget moments like when the main character is ripping out the still beating heart of a vampire and crushing it with his bare hands, lots of cool moments like those occur. However, when I watched it completely it felt like I was watching Chrono Crusade, Trigun, and D N Angel in a very screwed up way. Those who have seen those animes will know what I mean. That isn't the real problem though, there were moments that get your blood boiling with excitement and then there are these moments that kinda make your head turn a bit, it might be since there was not enough plot development before things got out of hand. It was like the producers were running out of time and didn't use the space they had wisely. Those are the only flaws I can see, I'm sure the mangas or books do a much better job in these plot issues. Just keep in mind if you buy this alone, there will be questions you won't get answered. That's my honest opinion, you bigger anime fans might just want to pass this one up, it kind of leaves an empty feeling inside after seeing the whole thing.  In general just be cautious and heed my words.
