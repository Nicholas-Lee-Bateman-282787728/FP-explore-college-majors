It's a smart, cerebral psychological story that follows Maxx a homeless guy/Hero of the Outback, a who is fated to skip between worlds, always in the service of Julie, the freelance social worker/Outback Jungle Queen that he is sworn to protect... or be protected by.  Enter Mr. Gone and the Iszzz, strange shape-shifting creatures bent on Maxx and Julie's destruction, they are the minions of Mr. Gone.The kicker? Neither world may actually exist, Julie's troubled past and her emotional scars resulting from an assault some years before may have possibly created both the characters' dilemma and the world they reside in itself.A wonderfully exciting series based on the groundbreaking comic by Sam Keith.

1296993,A1WMCX4CYZCYXE,B002WJHDJI,Mike,"[0, 0]","I suspect most of the people buying this know what it is, so I'll review the dvd release itself first. This DVD-R is a no-frills 2 disc collection of a series that ran on MTV Oddities.The special features are essentially just the commentary and an interview. This disc includes a 15 minute or so interview with Sam Keith and the director which is interesting and the exact right length of time. It also includes a commentary on every episode by Sam Keith and some of the folks from Rough Draft. Honestly, the commentary is terrible. Sam Keith, while clearly a brilliant artist (just look at his work), gives an awful commentary. It's nice that they tried, though I suppose.The Rough Draft people mostly just talk about how great the Maxx was or reminisce about working at Rough Draft. The commentary is basically a Maxx group masturbation session. They only occasionally talk about what's onscreen. I've only ever seen this before on some of the Stargate SG-1 commentaries after season 5 - where it seems like they'll grab everyone from gaffers to the pool boy so they can have a commentary for EVERY episode.The Maxx commentary has the same problem - there are some really experimental things that weren't done in American animation before this show and they manage to mention maybe 1/10th of them. Instead they're talking about someone's nickname or something. You can't comment on every single episode or the commentary turns into a conversation between old friends. It has to, there's only so much one person does in creating each episode.It's a relatively no-frills collection (vs. say the far superior Aeon Flux collection with 2 featurettes, shorts collection, shorts and good commentary, production art, etc) and on the whole while it looks better than VHS, it still only looks about VCD-quality and uses blue-bottomed discs and a cheap looking insert (which, taken together, is why I took off a point), but it's really nice to see MTV put it out since it's such a great show. If you're a Maxx fan or like anime or comics, buy it. I had no problems playing the DVD-R on my portable dvd player or xbox 360.In case you don't know about the show, ""The Maxx"" is a show about a delusional homeless man moonlighting as a superhero who frequently escapes to a dreamworld called ""the Outback"" where he is more than a man and where the social worker that cares for him in the real world is the leopard queen that he cares for. The problem is, these worlds began to merge thanks to the actions of the villain, Mr. Gone and his mutant Iz.It sounds a bit hokey, but the show is a lot of wacky fun and the visuals in this show are amazing. Unsurprising really, Sam Keith even admits in the interview he considers himself an artist first. Also purists should be happy - this show reflect the comic better than anything I've ever seen based on an American Comic. It's also, quite oddly for a comic, very psychological. The only downside to the show itself is that it ends abruptly (only 13 episodes X 15 minutes each for only 3 hours of show). It's really one of the best pieces of american cartoons for adults I've ever watched.If you want to continue the story, this adapts episodes 1-11 (and I think 0 and 1/2, but don't quote me on that, haven't read it in a while), so you can read the rest of it in the comics after that.Either way, definitely buy it if you're into the Maxx, anime, or comics.

1296994,A2ARDVMUGDFED6,B002WJHDJI,MiRSD,"[23, 26]","I won't go into depth on the details of the show - chances are that if you're thinking about this DVD you already know of the show and love it!I've been waiting years for a ""MAXX"" release on DVD, but I have to say I'm disappointed in this one. I can't say whether it's an issue with the show itself or the DVD, but the DVD is hard to watch at times. Aliasing (""Jaggies""), Rainbows and flickering are only some of the problems, but they're very noticeable and obvious throughout. Other problems popping up have been pixelation and color banding. The show just doesn't look nearly as good as it should have - it actually seems like a low resolution video (320x240?) being blown up to fit the screen without any cleanup or remastering (almost as if they just decided to ""throw it out there""). The CG parts being much worse (more obvious) than the animated parts. I would say it looks better than the VHS I had years ago, but not the jump in quality you would expect on DVD (and the VHS was released 13 1/2 years ago!). I would give the video quality about a 6.5/10 by todays standards.The disc DOES have a few extra features (interviews, commentary and a recap episode) - while not much, having commentary on each episode is great (I havent had a chance to listen to this yet - the  commentary is by Sam Kieth (Creator), Gregg Vanzo (Director), Claudia Katz (producer), Seth Kearsley (storyboards/character layouts)). The interviews, while also a great feature, disappointingly seemed to be in non-anamorphic widescreen (4:3 letterboxed).Also disappointing is the ""Burn on demand"" part of this product. While the packaging and labels are professional like any other store-bought DVD, these come on blue-backed discs (much like any DVD-R you can buy in stores) - the downside are that these don't last as long as professional pressed discs. Another big downside is that on my first set, the 2nd disc was badly scratched (if you've ever had a spindle of DVD-Rs, you've probably come across some that just look to be in terrible condition - that's how this one was). The replacement copy was much better, but the first disc had a few light scratches but also fingerprints on the bottom of the disc right out of the box. It just doesn't seem like much quality control went into these.Overall a great show that I have to recommend as this is the only DVD available. I would have liked to see it be remastered in some way, but unfortunately that's just not the case here. The DVD extras are great, the bonus content is great, but the video appears poor on a 24"" widescreen monitor (upscaled to 1080p by the PS3) - the effect was much worse watching on a 50"" TV. SDTV will probably look fine, but this show just wasn't  meant for the type of displays we use nowadays.",4,"5 for the show, 3 for this DVD",1261440000,"12 22, 2009",2009,2757,"['wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'depth', 'details', 'show', 'chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'DVD', 'already', 'know', 'show', 'love', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'years', 'MAXX', 'release', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'issue', 'show', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'Aliasing', 'Jaggies', 'Rainbows', 'flickering', 'are', 'only', 'problems', ""'re"", 'very', 'noticeable', 'obvious', 'Other', 'problems', 'popping', 'up', 'have', 'been', 'pixelation', 'color', 'banding', 'show', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'should', 'have', 'actually', 'low', 'resolution', 'video', '320x240', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'fit', 'screen', 'cleanup', 'remastering', 'almost', 'just', 'decided', 'throw', 'out', 'there', 'CG', 'parts', 'being', 'much', 'worse', 'more', 'obvious', 'animated', 'parts', 'would', 'say', 'better', 'VHS', 'had', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'jump', 'quality', 'would', 'expect', 'DVD', 'VHS', 'was', 'released', '13', '1/2', 'years', 'ago', 'would', 'give', 'video', 'quality', '6.5/10', 'todays', 'standards.The', 'disc', 'DOES', 'have', 'few', 'extra', 'features', 'interviews', 'commentary', 'recap', 'episode', 'not', 'much', 'having', 'commentary', 'episode', 'great', 'havent', 'had', 'chance', 'listen', 'yet', 'commentary', 'Sam', 'Kieth', 'Creator', 'Gregg', 'Vanzo', 'Director', 'Claudia', 'Katz', 'producer', 'Seth', 'Kearsley', 'storyboards/character', 'layouts', 'interviews', 'also', 'great', 'feature', 'disappointingly', 'seemed', 'be', 'non-anamorphic', 'widescreen', '4:3', 'letterboxed', '.Also', 'disappointing', 'Burn', 'demand', 'part', 'product', 'packaging', 'labels', 'are', 'professional', 'other', 'store-bought', 'DVD', 'come', 'blue-backed', 'discs', 'much', 'DVD-R', 'can', 'buy', 'stores', 'downside', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'last', 'as', 'long', 'professional', 'pressed', 'discs', 'big', 'downside', 'first', 'set', '2nd', 'disc', 'was', 'badly', 'scratched', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'spindle', 'DVD-Rs', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'come', 'just', 'look', 'be', 'terrible', 'condition', 'how', 'one', 'was', 'replacement', 'copy', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'first', 'disc', 'had', 'few', 'light', 'scratches', 'also', 'fingerprints', 'bottom', 'disc', 'right', 'box', 'just', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'quality', 'control', 'went', 'these.Overall', 'great', 'show', 'have', 'recommend', 'only', 'DVD', 'available', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'be', 'remastered', 'way', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'bonus', 'content', 'great', 'video', 'poor', '24', 'widescreen', 'monitor', 'upscaled', '1080p', 'PS3', 'effect', 'was', 'much', 'worse', 'watching', '50', 'TV', 'SDTV', 'will', 'probably', 'look', 'fine', 'show', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'type', 'displays', 'use', 'nowadays']",N/A

This set collects the Maxx stories from MTV's ""Oddities"" series almost exactly as originally presented on TV.  These 13 10-12 minutes episodes will warp your mind, but in a good way!The two main characters are the Maxx, a huge purple violent lummox on a mission to save The City from crime, and Julie, a free-lance social worker who takes care of him.  Crime in this case basically consists of Mr. Gone, a shamanistic serial rapist and murderer, and his henchmen, the Isz, critters from another plane of existence who turn meateater when brought into the real world.  Ah, but which world is the real world?  The world of The City, or the Outback?  The Outback is (in a way) Julie's subconscious mind, and Maxx, Julie, and Mr. Gone bop back and forth between the two worlds, for reasons you'll discover as you watch the series.Some of the episodes can be pretty sad, so even though you could watch all 13 episodes at once, I think you should split it up over a couple of days.  (I also think you shouldn't read Watchmen all in one day.)The show is sometimes almost a panel-for-panel adaptation of the original comic.  By the 13th issue of the comic (or the 13th episode of the series), there are still a lot of things left hanging, which won't be resolved until issue 20 of the comic, so if you want resolution on these, you'll have to getMaxx, The: VOL 03 (Maxx (Wildstorm/DC Comics))which contains issues 14-20 of the comic. (I had to go to wikipedia (and not Amazon!) to find out which of the collected volumes covered which comics.)Extras: Much like Mr. Gone, the commentary track tells me truths I'd rather not hear.

I don't need to talk about the show itself because i would be preaching to the choir.  I do want to clear up some things that people have said.1) I ordered these through Amazon, so I don't know if Amazon made the DVDs and packaging or MTV did since they have them for the same price and it is their show.  However, the DVDs are professional quality with real artwork on them.  They are silver and do not look like home DVDR disks, so I can only assume they are copied with professional equipment.  They play perfectly on my Windows 7 based computer's DVDR drive.2) The sound and appearance is wonderful.  Given modern transfers and equipment, I'm sure it looks better than when I originally watched it on my TV.  If you want to quibble about a couple of minor, split-second visual things I guess that is your right.  I am too thrilled to have the complete series and have it look this good to care.3) The sound is just as good as the visuals.  Of course all voice actors are outstanding.Finally, there is another huge reason to get this.  Amazon puts the online version in your video library right away!!  How amazing is that?  Not only do you not have to wait to watch it, but you don't have to worry about anything happening to your copy either.  How can you pass that up?!  For the price of the DVDs you get the physical disks and instant video version to keep in your library.  Its as though someone asked me what I wanted and than gave it to me.  Thanks Amazon or MTV or whoever is responsible for making that decision.  Hopefully more rare things will become available in this way because of on demand manufacturing.",5,Finally!

Which, if you're even viewing this page you probably are. This is one of the more obscure shows I could ever think of and the fact that you're able to find it on DVD in any way shape or form is miraculous in and of it's self.I remember this show and still have the tape I made of it when it originally aired, the show is intact and looks as good as ever, there was no remaster done here so you're really just getting DVD copies of whatever standard definition NTSC master that Amazon got from MTV, this of course means whatever flaws were in the original airings are still there on the DVD's. As for certain other comments about the show not looking good on modern displays, I disagree, I think the show looks as it was intended to even on my new 32"" HDTV and upscaled by a PS3. I don't have any problems with the presentation anyways. Yeah, the DVD-R discs make it feel kinda home made but the rest of the packaging and discs are very professional and look very nice, flawless really.Commentaries are a cool bonus and the price is a steal considering how ravenously this DVD was being craved by fans a couple years ago. This is a really killer show and almost translates the first ten issues of the comic to animation page for page. So Sam Keith fans or The Maxx fans or someone just looking for something cool this is really a great show and very trippy. Highly recommended.On a side note, purchase of this DVD gives you instant access to the show via Amazon's video on demand which is nice of them, but it would have been nicer if they would have allowed you to access the commentaries or some of the other bonus materials.

It's a pretty decent conversion, and far better than copying the VHS to DVD with one of those combo units (trust me, I did that).The biggest problem I have with this product, which is why it gets four stars instead of five, is the medium they ship it on. It's a DVD-R, which, as you see in the description, won't play in any computer. Since my primary movie-watching system is a computer, that's a problem for me. It also means you can't use Handbrake or any other program to get the movie to play on your portable devices, Xbox, or whatever, so basically, you're stuck in old-school land. Truly unfortunate.If you don't care about that, this is a pretty cool series and well worth seeing it in better clarity than you've probably seen it in a looooong time.",4,"Great series, not such a great medium",1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,857,"['watched', 'Maxx', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'have', 'old', 'VHS', 'version', 'now', 'have', 'one', 'pretty', 'decent', 'conversion', 'far', 'better', 'copying', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'one', 'combo', 'units', 'trust', 'did', '.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'product', 'why', 'four', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'medium', 'ship', 'DVD-R', 'see', 'description', 'wo', ""n't"", 'play', 'computer', 'primary', 'movie-watching', 'system', 'computer', 'problem', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'use', 'Handbrake', 'other', 'program', 'get', 'movie', 'play', 'portable', 'devices', 'Xbox', 'whatever', 'so', 'basically', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'old-school', 'land', 'Truly', 'unfortunate.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'pretty', 'cool', 'series', 'well', 'seeing', 'better', 'clarity', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'looooong', 'time']",N/A
1297005,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B002WJHDJI,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 0]","In the early 1990's MTV was at the top of its game. The music videos of the grunge era were always on and MTV had just crossed over into its own original scripted programming. On one hand you had the birth of the very first reality show and you had a strong animation department. MTV was the host of 4 major TV shows and one of them was the cult classic comic book adaptation, The Maxx.The Maxx, like in the comic is not your typical super-hero in fact while he may have powers he may be one of the most human. The Maxx is an individual that has an involuntary ability to shift in and out of dreams and reality. His only friend is a young woman named Julie, who tries to hide from it. The two of them share an unexplainable bond, but there is a strange fellow who knows the link, yet like all `humans' why spoil the fun?I was actually a reader of the comic book and I have to say that it is one of the most original stories ever. It is not about the battle of good and evil. The Maxx is a very human story with an outlandish shell. The feel of the show is like watching an old Ralph Bakshi film, very off color and honky-tonk. It is a story about being strong in a world that unjust and taking a look inside the human mind where we feel invincible. The show is well acted, has some unbelievable visuals and you get a great laugh from time to time. Though the show only lasted one season, it had a solid fan base. The show could not have come out at a more perfect time and it was perfect just the way it was. I think having to extend this show by the season would have really done it damage. Just like the show the comic went soon after. I highly recommend getting this DVD collection. You will never see anything quite as original and unusual again.",5,Unlike anything you have ever seen.,1267488000,"03 2, 2010",2010,1750,"['early', '1990', 'MTV', 'was', 'top', 'game', 'music', 'videos', 'grunge', 'era', 'were', 'always', 'MTV', 'had', 'just', 'crossed', 'over', 'own', 'original', 'scripted', 'programming', 'one', 'hand', 'had', 'birth', 'very', 'first', 'reality', 'show', 'had', 'strong', 'animation', 'department', 'MTV', 'was', 'host', '4', 'major', 'TV', 'shows', 'one', 'was', 'cult', 'classic', 'comic', 'book', 'adaptation', 'Maxx.The', 'Maxx', 'comic', 'not', 'typical', 'super-hero', 'fact', 'may', 'have', 'powers', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'human', 'Maxx', 'individual', 'involuntary', 'ability', 'shift', 'dreams', 'reality', 'only', 'friend', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Julie', 'who', 'hide', 'two', 'share', 'unexplainable', 'bond', 'strange', 'fellow', 'who', 'link', 'humans', 'why', 'spoil', 'fun', 'was', 'actually', 'reader', 'comic', 'book', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'stories', 'ever', 'not', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'Maxx', 'very', 'human', 'story', 'outlandish', 'shell', 'feel', 'show', 'watching', 'old', 'Ralph', 'Bakshi', 'film', 'very', 'color', 'honky-tonk', 'story', 'being', 'strong', 'world', 'unjust', 'taking', 'look', 'human', 'mind', 'where', 'feel', 'invincible', 'show', 'well', 'acted', 'unbelievable', 'visuals', 'get', 'great', 'laugh', 'time', 'time', 'show', 'only', 'lasted', 'one', 'season', 'had', 'solid', 'fan', 'base', 'show', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'come', 'out', 'more', 'perfect', 'time', 'was', 'perfect', 'just', 'way', 'was', 'think', 'having', 'extend', 'show', 'season', 'would', 'have', 'really', 'done', 'damage', 'Just', 'show', 'comic', 'went', 'soon', 'highly', 'recommend', 'getting', 'DVD', 'collection', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'quite', 'original', 'unusual', 'again']",N/A

I remember getting home late at night after working security and sitting down with a pizza and watching what Much Music (MTV In USA) had to offer, The Head, Aeon Flux, Spawn and the Maxx. The Maxx was dark and cerebral with a dash of over the top violence for good measure. It was one of my favorite shows.The DVD of the Maxx is not bad picture quality considering when it was filmed (I think it was late 80's, early 90's), even the 3d stuff was not too bad. Remember even the simplest 3D at the time took 2 to 3 days to render unlike today when it takes 3 minutes. I enjoyed the commentaries and special features which gave some insight into the development of the show. Overall not a bad purchase and would recommend.",5,Taking to the Maxx,1297814400,"02 16, 2011",2011,782,"['found', 'nostalgia', 'wash', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'Maxx', 'remember', 'getting', 'home', 'late', 'night', 'working', 'security', 'sitting', 'down', 'pizza', 'watching', 'what', 'Much', 'Music', 'MTV', 'USA', 'had', 'offer', 'Head', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Spawn', 'Maxx', 'Maxx', 'was', 'dark', 'cerebral', 'dash', 'top', 'violence', 'good', 'measure', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows.The', 'DVD', 'Maxx', 'not', 'bad', 'picture', 'quality', 'considering', 'when', 'was', 'filmed', 'think', 'was', 'late', '80', 'early', '90', 'even', '3d', 'stuff', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'Remember', 'even', 'simplest', '3D', 'time', 'took', '2', '3', 'days', 'render', 'today', 'when', '3', 'minutes', 'enjoyed', 'commentaries', 'special', 'features', 'gave', 'insight', 'development', 'show', 'Overall', 'not', 'bad', 'purchase', 'would', 'recommend']",N/A
