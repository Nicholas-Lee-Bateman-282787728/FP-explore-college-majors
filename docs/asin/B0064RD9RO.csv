Toni, her Mom and sisters give a whole new meaning to this type of program, and take it to a higher level.  They are all fantastic.  Can't wait for Season 2 to be released on DVD.

1510180,A170QM825KM60W,B0064RD9RO,rmcrae,"[8, 8]","When I first heard about Toni Braxton getting a reality show with her sisters, I was a bit wary. Toni's been doing her thing in the music scene for about 2 decades with a few Grammys to her name and while I knew about her financial issues, I didn't think it was such a good idea to put her life on tv for all to see. I'm glad to say I was wrong. Braxton Family Values does get into serious territory from time to time, but for the most part it's light and fun and celebrates the tight bond the sisters seem to have with each other.While Toni is the most known to the public, she's the oldest of five sisters.I have to start with Tamar, the baby, because she is a mess who will pop off at the mouth whenever and however she wants. You can thank (or blame) her for bringing "".com"" and "".org"" back as catch phrases. She's the only other sister to release a solo record back in the day, but it flopped and these days she's made it her mission to step away from being her big sister's back-up singer and release another record of her own. She drives her husband Vince (who manages Lady Gaga and used to be Toni's manager) crazy with her constant demands and overall brattiness. As annoying and ""over the top.com"" as she is, Tamar is entertaining and will have you rolling with her irreverent comments.Now going back in order, Traci had to drop out of the entertainment industry once she gave birth to her son, got married, and settled in the family's native Baltimore. Because of that, she feels like an outsider and wants so desperately to sing with her sisters again. She and Tamar bump heads alot since Tamar is supreme when it comes to inserting her opinion when it isn't warranted.Towanda is married with 2 young children, but her relationship with her husband is complicated, to put it simply. They're separated yet he still lives with her so he can co-parent. He could live somewhere else (and get off his behind and get a job) and still co-parent, but I digress. On top of the stress at home, Towanda is Toni's personal assistant and has to put up with her sister's often silly demands. Trina is also married with 2 kids and the relationship with her husband is strained. Apparently he's cheated on her for most of their marriage yet has the nerve to track HER every move. Then again it's a smart move because Trina loves to knock back the sauce a bit too much, if you know what I mean. There's an episode dedicated to her DUI and all that drama. That aside, Trina is funny with her open freakiness (think Lynn from Girlfriends) and frank comments.Then there's mom Evelyn. She's a lovely Christian woman who loves her daughters with all her heart, but won't hesitate putting them (*cough*TAMAR*cough*) in check when needed. She's still healing from the betrayal of her ex-husband (an ex-minister who now acts like a pimp from a bad blaxploitation flick) and you've gotta see the showdown between them in one of the final episodes. I'll leave it at ""you laid it low and spread it wide!""Every episode is fun to watch and will hold your attention. If you're in need of something to make you laugh and feel like you're one of the family, chill with the Braxtons. ""DOO WOP POP POP with Toni Braxton. THAT AIN'T HOT!""

1510181,A233UR4B7OT4RR,B0064RD9RO,ROFLChopper,"[14, 14]","Oh how I enjoyed the very first season of The Braxtons on WETV.  The fact they are sisters and talented makes it's more worth watching!  As a person who watches reality tv occasionally, I've grown tired of talentless socialites being viewed as stars and/or the average person making a fool of themselves for a mere 15-minutes of fame.  The Braxtons, while they are now part of the reality tv formula, they show why they have been in the music business for over 20 years lead by star Toni Braxton.Toni Braxton is a platinum selling-Grammy winning recording star whose faced the ups and downs of the business.  She's filed for bankruptcy a few times and has met her fair share of health issues (this will be revealed later in the season).  Overall she keeps a positive outlook on life and continues being a great singer and parent to her sons.Tamar is without question the diva of all her sisters.  She very funny with coin phases '.org' and '.com.' She has a drive to get away from sister Toni's shadow and becoming a star in her own right.  Tamar is also married to Vince Herbert who manages Toni and Lady Gaga who is quite headstrong and doesn't let her get away with much of anything.Towanda also has dreams of being more than Toni's personal assistant and background singer.  She has visions of being a movie actress.  Trina is fun and silly but you will see she likes hitting the bottle alot during this season.  Traci is the sister who never got a chance to be in the business like her sisters, while she still keeps this dream alive she stays the devoted mother.  You will plus be introduced to Trina's, Traci's and Towanda's husbands all of which are quite interesting as the season progresses.Lastly, you will be see alot of the girls mother, Evelyn, who is sweet yet has no problem telling it how it is especially to Tamar.I will say if you haven't seen season 1, don't heistant to pick this up.  5 out of 5 stars!",5,The Braxtons: Season 1,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",2011,1923,"['Oh', 'how', 'enjoyed', 'very', 'first', 'season', 'Braxtons', 'WETV', 'fact', 'are', 'sisters', 'talented', 'more', 'worth', 'watching', 'person', 'who', 'reality', 'tv', 'occasionally', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'tired', 'talentless', 'socialites', 'being', 'viewed', 'stars', 'average', 'person', 'making', 'fool', 'mere', '15-minutes', 'fame', 'Braxtons', 'are', 'now', 'part', 'reality', 'tv', 'formula', 'show', 'why', 'have', 'been', 'music', 'business', '20', 'years', 'lead', 'star', 'Toni', 'Braxton.Toni', 'Braxton', 'platinum', 'selling-Grammy', 'winning', 'recording', 'star', 'faced', 'ups', 'downs', 'business', 'filed', 'bankruptcy', 'few', 'times', 'met', 'fair', 'share', 'health', 'issues', 'will', 'be', 'revealed', 'later', 'season', 'Overall', 'positive', 'outlook', 'life', 'being', 'great', 'singer', 'parent', 'sons.Tamar', 'question', 'diva', 'sisters', 'very', 'funny', 'coin', 'phases', ""'.com"", 'drive', 'get', 'away', 'sister', 'Toni', 'shadow', 'becoming', 'star', 'own', 'right', 'Tamar', 'also', 'married', 'Vince', 'Herbert', 'who', 'Toni', 'Lady', 'Gaga', 'who', 'quite', 'headstrong', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'away', 'much', 'anything.Towanda', 'also', 'dreams', 'being', 'more', 'Toni', 'personal', 'assistant', 'background', 'singer', 'visions', 'being', 'movie', 'actress', 'Trina', 'fun', 'silly', 'will', 'see', 'hitting', 'bottle', 'alot', 'season', 'Traci', 'sister', 'who', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'be', 'business', 'sisters', 'still', 'dream', 'alive', 'devoted', 'mother', 'will', 'be', 'introduced', 'Trina', 'Traci', 'Towanda', 'husbands', 'are', 'quite', 'interesting', 'season', 'progresses.Lastly', 'will', 'be', 'see', 'alot', 'girls', 'mother', 'Evelyn', 'who', 'sweet', 'yet', 'problem', 'telling', 'how', 'especially', 'Tamar.I', 'will', 'say', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'season', '1', 'do', ""n't"", 'heistant', 'pick', 'up', '5', '5', 'stars']",Braxton Family Values Season 1
