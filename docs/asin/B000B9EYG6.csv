938242,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B000B9EYG6,Andy Orrock,"[3, 5]","We've been very pleased to stumble on to some truly fine French DVDs in the past few years of viewing.  Consider yourself lucky if you've seen either of Jacques Audiard's masterpieces (The Beat That My Heart Skippedand the incomparableRead My Lips) or Francis Veber's works (The Closetand the smart comedyThe Dinner Game, based on Verber's play).  Unfortunately, Arnaud Desplechin's 'Kings and Queens' does not join that pantheon of must-sees.  We rented it due to the Emmanuelle Devos connection (she's brilliant in 'Read My Lips').  For those thinking of renting, be aware that Desplechin - who's apparently never met an editor - subjects his audience to 2 hours and 30 minutes of navel-gazing bloat.  There might be a good 1 hour 45 minute movie in here, but the experience is simply caked in torrents of words going off in opposite directions - there's a slightly melodramatic track following Devos and her series of small crises; then, there's a frenetic comedic track following her ex, Ishmael, as manically portrayed by Mathieu Amalric.  Desplechin mashes these together, but the tales never jell.The only thing that stuck with me is the beautiful rendition of Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" that opens and closes the film.

938245,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,B000B9EYG6,C. B Collins Jr.,"[27, 35]","This is a pretty complex work of art, so be ready for 2.5 hours of moody melodrama and odd-ball comedy. There are two major story lines in this film, not the typical pattern of a central story line that has a few tangents. These two story lines have equal weight and are allowed to develop for over an hour independent of each other before the films allows the overlap of stories and characters.In the first story, a beautiful and sophisticated woman, Nora, visits her retired university professor father and finds him very ill. Supported by the staff of the art gallery she manages as well as a sophisticated millionaire boyfriend, she begins to assist her father navigate the medical system. She contacts her junkie sister who begins to hitch hike to her father's side before he dies. She competently holds everything together until a hospice nurse begins to help as the old man goes down for the third time. The intense emotions, the odd dreams, the confrontive relationships full of old hurts, all reminded me of Ingmar Bergman's moody films.In the second story, a delightfully eccentric musician is hospitalized in a mental hospital at the request of his rageful sister and some unknown party. Ismael, the musician, is comic, creative, resourceful, delightful, sensitive, eccentric, and oddly sexy. He does on a quest to find out who and why he was hositalized. He gets little help from his addicted lawyer or his cold psychiatrist, played by Catherine Deneuve. He continues to see his African Freudian psychotherapist, whom he has seen for 7 years, and we are treated to some wonderful scenes of psychotherapy gone astray. As Ismael runs amuck in the poorly supervised mental hospital, I was reminded of One Flew Oer the Cuckoo's Nest, however there is no mean Nurse Rachett, there are only poorly supervised mental patients eating each other's medications and smoking pot. Ismael is attracted to women in crisis, and finds a suicidal young woman in the hospital, which begins to give us a clue into the relationship he and Nora shared years ago.We find that Nora was reared by her father to be proud, in control, and highly competent and self contained. Her first husband dies in an automobile accident while she is pregnant and yet she choses to have the baby and proudfully move forward with her life and career as a single mother. Only gradually do we learn that the story was not really as heroic or simple.Ismael learns that through his delightful and loving family that his crazy rageful sister had him committed along with the business partner of his string quartet.Nora's father dies before her sister Chloe arrives and when Chole arrives she is in a rage that he died before she arrives.Gradually the tragic, moody, complicated story of Nora unfolds and we find that she murdered her first boyfriend and her father helped coach her testimony to cover up the incident. Later Nora gives her father enough morphine to kill his pain but also to overdose him and speed his death.How do these two stories overlap?  Well at one time Nora was married to Ismael, a time that you realize was very happy for them both. He was rescuing a woman in pain and she found a fresh soul to nourish her. Nora wishes for Ismael to adopt her son before she marries the sophisticated millionaire who has become her lover but not her emotional support. At first this makes no sense, but as we get to know the sane side of Ismael and the dark side of Nora, it begins to make all the sense in the world.Nora's father has raised her to be totally emotionally competent and contained, to be the Queen, to meet her own needs, and yet the old man has grown to dispise his creation, to dispise her strength and ability to distance herself emotionally from the events at hand. He parts from this life mostly concerned with editing his last book yet he leaves a final painful parting shot in a crushingly cruel letter to Nora.We now realize that Nora knows that she was reared by an intellectual sadist father and she wants her son to be adopted by a loving and insane man, Ismael, her second husband. Ismael declines this request, knowing that the 9 year old fellow is beyond his ability to emotionally support over the long term. Yet Ismael explains this to Nora's son in completely beautiful and loving and confirming ways when they spend a day in the natural history museum. Nora's father was internationally known for his brilliance, yet he was cruel to his daughters. Ismael, on the other hand, the runaway mental patient, is loving, caring for others, erotic, honest, playful, and creative.In an odd way, the film reminds me of Charles Dicken's Great Expectations. In Dickens novel, the proudful Estalla has been emptionally reared to treat men cruely by Miss Havisham. Yet in the end, Estella does not marry Pip, the sweet boy that loves her, and selects to marry a man with whom she is not emotionally attached but also one she will not hurt. Estella and Nora have some traits in common.You are probably tired of reading all this at this point. I need to tell you that I have only scratched the surface of this film. It is multi-layered with meanings hidden within meanings. It is exceptionally well made, well acted, well written, and beautifully filmed. It is complex and adult. No one is a villian, not one is a hero, they are what they are - living characters - which attests to the strength of this film.",5,Ingmar Bergman meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,1133308800,"11

938246,A2SRZQU1SZG4RR,B000B9EYG6,"Erika Borsos ""pepper flower""","[4, 7]","Emanuelle Devos plays Nora a successful 35 year old art gallery owner whose current boyfriend/fiance provides her with the queenly lifestyle to which she aspires, however the viewer gradually learns he has a darkside which Nora either denies or ... or to which she is strangely attracted. Initially, Nora seems a pulled together highly successful person but as the deep inner layers of her life are explored and peeled back, many facets of her complex and confusing nature are revealed using flashbacks to her past life. Her personality and life decisions are shown in a most ingenious manner by the director. This film is a totally satisfying viewing experience despite the temptation to just shake her up with a good heart-to-heart talk about the decisions she is contemplating related to raising her son. Then again, given her complex convoluted nature, maybe she is doing the right thing after all. The film is very surreal in its portrayal of her multifaceted personality and convoluted emotional life... all of which seem to revolve around the ""kings"" or men in her life. She is of course ""the queen.""The complex and tempestuous father-daughter relationship is revealed with her discovery and reading of her father's personal diary. She learns about his innner most feelings and thoughts when he is dying of stomach cancer. She helps navigate the healthcare system to meet his end-of-life needs. While initially she seemed a very composed sophisticated, together type person, her emotional complexity and neediness nearly unglues her life as the viewer learns how the several ""Kings"" in her life rule her emotions: her father, her ex-husband Ismael, her son, and the memory of a past love interest, the father of her son, who dies unexpectedly. It is amazing how the film manages to convey so much ... in about 2 1/2 hours.The other parallel story in the film is about Ismael, Nora's ex-husband and ex-lover who is played by Mathieu Amalric. He is an avant-garde jazz musician who belongs to a stringed quartet which is gaining recognition and popularity. He lives the semi-hedonistic lifestyle of a musical artist, one who does not pay much heed to everyday realities such as his rent or income tax ... When he is suddenly confined and committed against his will to a mental hospital for reasons unknown and by persons unknown: he starts to face the realities of his life, possibly for the first time, intending to follow a more straight and narroow path. His first goal is, of course, to convince his psychiatrist/psychologist that he is normal. His other goal is to find out who did this to him. But first he has to get out of the mental ward ... Catherine Deneuve plays the psychiatrist to  perfection. Some of their conversations are very funny. At the facility he meets a confused young female inmate with whom he has a liason. Oddly enough while he is facing and fighting his personal demons, Nora considers their past life together, shown in flashback scenes. She makes a monumental and surprising decision about one of the ""kings"" in her life. This unusual twist in the film provides a highly satisfying and totally unexpected heart-warming ending. French films are famous for their human interest stories with deeply complex psychological underpinnings, anyone who has an interest in exploring and understanding human nature would enjoy this film.

938247,A2BPDFR58H9575,B000B9EYG6,Galina,"[2, 3]","""Rois et reine"" aka ""Kings and Queen"" (2004) directed by Arnaud Desplechin is a most unusual film that mixes expertly comical and tragic, unbearable and optimistic, life and death that are intertwined in the story of two former lovers whose lives have crossed once more when they least expected. Nora (Devos) has to take care of her dying father. Ismael (Almaric), a talented but neurotic musician (Roman Polansky + Woody Allen) is mistakenly committed to a mental hospital under the care of a clinical psychiatrist, forever young and still the most beautiful woman in the world, Catherine Denueve. (""Do you know that you are very beautiful""? - asked Ismael. ""I've been told"", smiles she). I still think about the movie - the complicated relationships between one woman and several men in her life - how much she affected them, sometimes, with tragic consequences. This is also the movie about perception - how big is the difference between the way we see ourselves and the others see us and what they think of us in reality. It is a movie about love - is it always blind? Is it possible to love deeply and see with the clear eyes? I was totally engrossed and heartbroken by some scenes involving Devos's caring for her dying father, by the flashbacks that tell about her relationship with the father of her son, and next minute I was laughing out loud following the Almaric's ordeal in a mental hospital and his attempts to escape. The movie could've been a gem but it is too long, has too many characters that were perhaps very interesting but I never knew what happened to them and it could be confusing due to its broken narrative which was OK by me but the final result even compelling and memorable was not completely satisfying. Both Mathieu Almaric and Manu Devos are marvelously talented actors and they were the main reason that overlong and confusing movie worked. I hope to see both Almaric and Devos in many more movies. I remember Devos since the first movie I saw her in - ""Sur Mes Levres"" and I knew then that she had all potentials to become a great actress. Her acting in ""Rois et reine"" confirmed my first impression.3.5/5",3,All Queen's Men,1177113600,"04 21, 2007",2007,2141,"['Rois', 'et', 'reine', 'Kings', 'Queen', '2004', 'directed', 'Arnaud', 'Desplechin', 'most', 'unusual', 'film', 'expertly', 'comical', 'tragic', 'unbearable', 'optimistic', 'life', 'death', 'are', 'intertwined', 'story', 'two', 'former', 'lovers', 'lives', 'have', 'crossed', 'once', 'more', 'when', 'least', 'expected', 'Nora', 'Devos', 'take', 'care', 'dying', 'father', 'Ismael', 'Almaric', 'talented', 'neurotic', 'musician', 'Roman', 'Polansky', '+', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'mistakenly', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'care', 'clinical', 'psychiatrist', 'forever', 'young', 'still', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'world', 'Catherine', 'Denueve', 'Do', 'know', 'are', 'very', 'beautiful', 'asked', 'Ismael', ""'ve"", 'been', 'told', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'complicated', 'relationships', 'one', 'woman', 'several', 'men', 'life', 'how', 'much', 'affected', 'sometimes', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'also', 'movie', 'perception', 'how', 'big', 'difference', 'way', 'see', 'others', 'see', 'what', 'think', 'reality', 'movie', 'love', 'always', 'blind', 'possible', 'love', 'deeply', 'see', 'clear', 'eyes', 'was', 'totally', 'engrossed', 'heartbroken', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Devos', 'caring', 'dying', 'father', 'flashbacks', 'tell', 'relationship', 'father', 'son', 'next', 'minute', 'was', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'following', 'Almaric', 'ordeal', 'mental', 'hospital', 'attempts', 'escape', 'movie', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'gem', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'perhaps', 'very', 'interesting', 'never', 'knew', 'what', 'happened', 'could', 'be', 'confusing', 'due', 'broken', 'narrative', 'was', 'OK', 'final', 'result', 'even', 'compelling', 'memorable', 'was', 'not', 'completely', 'satisfying', 'Mathieu', 'Almaric', 'Manu', 'Devos', 'are', 'marvelously', 'talented', 'actors', 'were', 'main', 'reason', 'overlong', 'confusing', 'movie', 'worked', 'hope', 'see', 'Almaric', 'Devos', 'many', 'more', 'movies', 'remember', 'Devos', 'first', 'movie', 'saw', 'Sur', 'Mes', 'Levres', 'knew', 'then', 'had', 'potentials', 'become', 'great', 'actress', 'acting', 'Rois', 'et', 'reine', 'confirmed', 'first', 'impression.3.5/5']",Kings & Queen
938248,A124N94JZBXV59,B000B9EYG6,John Caruso,"[6, 11]","This movie is like the foreign film equivalent of a bad Hollywood action movie, but instead of car chases, fight scenes, and an endless stream of explosions, there are unconvincing plot twists, jarring mood swings, and frequent streams of pseudo-intellectual dialogue.  It's as though someone took a handful of foreign film cliches, tossed them into a blender, and threw the result against a wall.  It's confused, unfocused, overlong, and filled with unlikable characters.Some specific criticisms: the jump cuts that Desplechin so often uses feel like something out of a music video.  They're distracting, and only detract from the film.  The direction otherwise is serviceable, but best when it's unnoticed (one case where it wasn't was a sudden zoom-in closeup on two characters that stood out like a sore thumb but added nothing to the scene).  The vaunted unpredictability of the film mainly involves characters acting in ways that are inconsistent with what we know about them; these changes don't feel like organic revelations of deeper truths, but artificial shifts that are put in for novelty or shock value, and they only serve to distance the viewer.  When the dialogue veers into the philosophical it enters the murkiest depths of French film psychobabble, in which the assumption seems to be that profundity is something that just emerges when enough tortured statements are thrown together, rather than being the culmination of carefully thought-out dialogue (if you watch many French films you probably know just what I'm talking about).  The time-shifting storytelling is handled poorly, with sudden, arbitrary jumps that are confusing but which (once you get your bearings) don't further any apparent dramatic end.  Finally, the film as a whole is desperately in need of a good editor, with entire sequences and even entire characters that serve no discernible purpose; it could easily be an hour shorter.I was persuaded to rent this film on the strength of the many breathless, gushing reviews on the box, which fairly overflowed with exalted praise.  Sadly, the film lived up to none of it.  I'm giving it two stars because it at least has enough interest and technical merit to avoid the lowest rating, but I wouldn't consider watching it again, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.  I also watched Mysterious Skin and Chalk over the long weekend, and both of them are more worthwhile films (though in radically different ways) than this broken bauble.",2,"Artificial, unconvincing, and unsatisfying",1199232000,"01 2, 2008",2008,2488,"['movie', 'foreign', 'film', 'equivalent', 'bad', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movie', 'instead', 'car', 'chases', 'fight', 'scenes', 'endless', 'stream', 'explosions', 'are', 'unconvincing', 'plot', 'twists', 'jarring', 'mood', 'swings', 'frequent', 'streams', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'dialogue', 'someone', 'took', 'handful', 'foreign', 'film', 'cliches', 'tossed', 'blender', 'threw', 'result', 'wall', 'confused', 'unfocused', 'overlong', 'filled', 'unlikable', 'characters.Some', 'specific', 'criticisms', 'jump', 'cuts', 'Desplechin', 'so', 'often', 'feel', 'something', 'music', 'video', ""'re"", 'distracting', 'only', 'detract', 'film', 'direction', 'otherwise', 'serviceable', 'best', 'when', 'unnoticed', 'one', 'case', 'where', 'was', ""n't"", 'was', 'sudden', 'zoom-in', 'closeup', 'two', 'characters', 'stood', 'out', 'sore', 'thumb', 'added', 'nothing', 'scene', 'vaunted', 'unpredictability', 'film', 'mainly', 'characters', 'acting', 'ways', 'are', 'inconsistent', 'what', 'know', 'changes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'organic', 'revelations', 'deeper', 'truths', 'artificial', 'shifts', 'are', 'put', 'novelty', 'shock', 'value', 'only', 'serve', 'distance', 'viewer', 'When', 'dialogue', 'veers', 'philosophical', 'murkiest', 'depths', 'French', 'film', 'psychobabble', 'assumption', 'be', 'profundity', 'something', 'just', 'when', 'enough', 'tortured', 'statements', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'rather', 'being', 'culmination', 'carefully', 'thought-out', 'dialogue', 'watch', 'many', 'French', 'films', 'probably', 'know', 'just', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'time-shifting', 'storytelling', 'handled', 'poorly', 'sudden', 'arbitrary', 'jumps', 'are', 'confusing', 'get', 'bearings', 'do', ""n't"", 'further', 'apparent', 'dramatic', 'end', 'Finally', 'film', 'whole', 'desperately', 'need', 'good', 'editor', 'entire', 'sequences', 'even', 'entire', 'characters', 'serve', 'discernible', 'purpose', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'hour', 'shorter.I', 'was', 'persuaded', 'rent', 'film', 'strength', 'many', 'breathless', 'gushing', 'reviews', 'box', 'fairly', 'overflowed', 'exalted', 'praise', 'Sadly', 'film', 'lived', 'up', 'none', ""'m"", 'giving', 'two', 'stars', 'least', 'enough', 'interest', 'technical', 'merit', 'avoid', 'lowest', 'rating', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'watching', 'again', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'else', 'also', 'watched', 'Mysterious', 'Skin', 'Chalk', 'long', 'weekend', 'are', 'more', 'worthwhile', 'films', 'radically', 'different', 'ways', 'broken', 'bauble']",Kings & Queen

Nora is a woman who seeks to maintain her composure through the worst kinds of crises--the death of her lover, a father's betrayal--while Ismal is narcissistic, inappropriate, and bursting with strong emotions he can barely fathom. So his unexpectedly moving speech at the finale, in a scene with Lelong, is truly a highlight in a film blessed with many.

938251,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B000B9EYG6,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[28, 31]","There is a chilling scene towards the end of the brilliant, acidic and poetic ""Kings and Queen"" which shoots a flaming arrow through the heart of any notion that we may have that this film is in any way melodramatic or sentimental (the movie  begins and ends with ""Moon River""): Nora (the amazing Emmanuelle Devos) comes upon a passage in her dead father, Louis's  diary in which he writes about her and among other very cold and brutally honest things, he writes: ""I hate that you will survive me...I wish that you were the one dying...I hate you."" Couple this with Louis' admission that, since his wife, Nora's mother was sick for a long time, he fell in love with Nora and that she took advantage of his feelings for her...in essence she seduced him. Incest? I'm not sure.Director Arnaud Desplechin shoots this scene both in color (Nora reading) and in flickering, silent film style black and white (Louis reciting his diary): this simple set up is so effective and so truthful  that you gasp with recognition and understanding. Desplechin is dealing with the basic things of life here and what better in this scene than ""the thin line between love and hate?""Desplechin is  telling two stories here: one with Nora (and this Nora shares many qualities with Ibsen's Nora...i.e.....she recreates herself during the course of this film) and that of Ismael (the formidable Mathieu Almaric): a former lover of Nora's and a man who is bi-polar, though I prefer the old name for this disease, manic depression which more perfectly describes Ismael.Nora spends the entire film looking for a father for her child, Elias and Ismael spends the entire film looking for a safe place for himself. One of the most interesting things about this film is that out-of-control Ismael has a big, loving family who surround him with an all-encompassing warm fog of positivism while the controlled, ""my father always taught me to control my emotions"" Nora really has no one except her son. Nora and Ismael's worlds are opposite of the supposed natural order of things: aren't the well-loved and cared for supposed to be ""sane"" while the ill nurtured are more often, ""crazy?""Desplechin is dealing with so many things here: mental illness, paternal and maternal love and all its variations, drug addiction, the elements of psychiatric care, male/female relationships and on and on that it took me several viewings to begin to digest and  understand all the things with which Desplechin has stuffed his film.""Kings and Queen"" is palpably disturbing on many levels. It is not a comfortable, easily definable film. It's emotions and feelings are sometimes so brutally honest that they physically hurt.

938252,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000B9EYG6,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[15, 19]","This film really should have brought the director Andres Desplechin much deserved and long overdue fame in the United States; it is one of the best films to come out of France (as far as I can tell) in a long time, and one of the best films of the year from anywhere.  While very different, and a bit darker, I would compare the film to Jules and Jim for its fresh and illuminating power.It tells the story of Nora (the ""Queen"" played by the always intriguing Emmanuelle Devos), and the men in her life, most notably her two exes (one of whom either died or was killed and the other who has just been committed to a mental hospital), her current husband, her son, and her father.  She is, it seems, a light and lovely woman who one cannot help but admire, but one who (as we come to discover) can also devastate those who love her.  The film comes to alternate between Nora's point of view and that of Ismael, her lively if a bit neurotic ex-husband.  The characters are brought to life in a remarkable way, and the stories are brought to a very thoughtful and satisfying (even if a bit troubling) conclusion, insofar as both characters have a deep but very different connection to Nora's son.  One feature of the film that is particularly intriguing is the way in which (we) the audience are led to reevaluate our own allegiances to the various characters throughout the film.The film does start out a bit slowly, and takes its time to tell its stories, but it gradually came to grip me and I couldn't shake (and didn't want to) the feelings and memories and questions it raised for me for several days afterwards.  Desplechin employs several devices on occasion, such as blink jump cuts and fantasy scenes, that in the hands of a lesser director would amount to cliche or ostentatious display (I think of the recent film Stay with Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts along these lines: it overused its trickery to the point where it began feeling gimmicky) but here gives just the right atmosphere: leaving us a bit  unsure of what is real and what is point of view or reconstruction, even while everything as it unfolds has the same aura of authenticity.  It is really too bad that there is no market except on the fringe (where arthouse theaters seem to have been relegated in most cities) for films this thoughtful and sophisticated in the United States.

938254,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000B9EYG6,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 15]","""Kings and Queen"" is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirty-two minutes to no discernible point or purpose.The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie.  The first centers around Nora and her struggles with various men in her life, including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live.  The other story involves a young man named Ismael, a violinist who finds himself placed - unfairly, he believes - in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party.  After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that Ismael is a former lover of Nora's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier, tragic relationship.With a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining, ""Kings and Queen"" might have been a potent, engrossing drama about modern day relationships.  It certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power, and the performances are, for the most part, complex and touching.  But, taken as a whole, the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that, quite frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on.  Even more distressing is the fact that, even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people, we really don't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over.  For instance, Nora's father, on his deathbed, writes a withering diatribe against his daughter's character that simply doesn't gibe with the woman we've been looking at for well over two hours.  Nora is admittedly no Mother Theresa (then, again, who is?), but she certainly doesn't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father.  Nora could be accused of being  confused, indecisive, a bit self-absorbed at times, but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place?  I don't think so.Perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that I was unable to fathom.  But my suspicion is that even writer Roger Bohbot and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here.  This is a well acted, pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long, rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises, a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning.",2,rambling and unfocused drama,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,2577,"['Kings', 'Queen', 'bloated', 'French', 'drama', 'interminable', 'two', 'hours', 'thirty-two', 'minutes', 'discernible', 'point', 'purpose.The', 'film', 'features', 'two', 'stories', 'seem', 'unrelated', 'first', 'eventually', 'connect', 'one', 'halfway', 'movie', 'first', 'centers', 'Nora', 'struggles', 'various', 'men', 'life', 'including', 'elderly', 'father', 'who', 'only', 'few', 'days', 'left', 'live', 'other', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Ismael', 'violinist', 'who', 'placed', 'unfairly', 'mental', 'institution', 'machinations', 'unknown', 'third', 'party', 'traveling', 'along', 'separate', 'tracks', 'awhile', 'two', 'narrative', 'strands', 'eventually', 'come', 'together', 'when', 'learn', 'Ismael', 'former', 'lover', 'Nora', 'man', 'chosen', 'adopt', 'son', 'earlier', 'tragic', 'relationship.With', 'bit', 'more', 'focus', 'considerable', 'amount', 'streamlining', 'Kings', 'Queen', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'potent', 'engrossing', 'drama', 'modern', 'day', 'relationships', 'certainly', 'moments', 'tremendous', 'insight', 'emotional', 'power', 'performances', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'complex', 'touching', 'taken', 'whole', 'film', 'meanders', 'maunders', 'extent', 'quite', 'frankly', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'patience', 'wear', 'out', 'welcome', 'early', 'Even', 'more', 'distressing', 'fact', 'even', 'spend', 'what', 'mild', 'eternity', 'company', 'people', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'make', 'when', 'show', 'finally', 'over', 'instance', 'Nora', 'father', 'deathbed', 'withering', 'diatribe', 'daughter', 'character', 'simply', ""n't"", 'gibe', 'woman', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'well', 'two', 'hours', 'Nora', 'admittedly', 'Mother', 'Theresa', 'then', 'again', 'who', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'invective', 'thrown', 'very', 'own', 'father', 'Nora', 'could', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'confused', 'indecisive', 'bit', 'self-absorbed', 'times', 'evil', 'enough', 'have', 'father', 'wishing', 'could', 'give', 'cancer', 'make', 'die', 'place', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.Perhaps', 'film', 'simply', 'operating', 'level', 'depth', 'was', 'unable', 'fathom', 'suspicion', 'even', 'writer', 'Roger', 'Bohbot', 'co-writer/director', 'Arnaud', 'Desplechin', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'fully', 'explaining', 'purpose', 'here', 'well', 'acted', 'pretentious', 'bore', 'film', 'audience', 'long', 'rambling', 'voyage', 'sea', 'personal', 'crises', 'journey', 'viewer', 'wiser', 'more', 'enlightened', 'end', 'was', 'beginning']",Kings & Queen
