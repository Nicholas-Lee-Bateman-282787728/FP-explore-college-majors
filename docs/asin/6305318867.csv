After making the dreadful Hearts and Souls (with Alfre Woodard, trying to out-do GHOST) and Speechless (the romantic comedy which killed the careers of both its stars, Geena Davis and Michael Keaton) director Ron Underwood bounced back with this inventive, lively remake of an earlier 1949 movie.It should have made Charlize Theron, who plays Jill Young, a big, big star, but instead, Charlize had to bumble on for a few more years before winning an Oscar.James Horner's music outdoes his heart-wrenching symphonic themes for TITANIC, BRAVEHEART, and THE ROCKETEER, with a touch of African percussion and wood and wind instruments that bring the plains of Africa into mind whenever you hear them.  Charlize has a lovely song, ""Wind Song,"" sort of a lullaby for Mighty Joe, that should have been a hit on the scale of ""MY HEART WILL GO ON.""  But somehow people just weren't interested in this picture.  Maybe the forthcoming remake of KING KONG by Peter Jackson will have better luck with audiences.  It will have more publicity, for sure, for I don't think the studio was really behind Ron Underwood to the same degree that New Line supports Jackson.What a cast!

Jill grows up with the giant Gorilla and takes care of him in honor of her mother. Unfortunately poachers are always on the lookout for the giant gorilla, and so Jill and Joe have to relocate to a mini-preserve in California. Unfortunately the poacher that killed Jill's mother is out for revenge since Joe bit off his finger during the original encounter, and now it seems nowhere is safe for Joe.What a beautiful movie! Charlize Theron brings real heart to her character and it is her love for Joe as part of her family that makes this a movie to believe in. Bill Paxton does a fine job as the male lead, and they are well supported by great characters and actors (Regina King among them). Also watch out for Naveen Andrews who currently appears in the television series ""Lost"". The movie is extremely well directed by Ron Underwood, and the beautiful score by James Horner adds the movie's soul to Charlize Theron's heart.The picture quality on the DVD is good, thanks in part to the amazing cinematography, and the film is in a nicely balanced Dolby Digital 5.1. This movie is a rare gem. So yes it is a remake to the original Mighty Joe Young, and yes we have a new King Kong movie coming up, thus making this a bit of a middle child. Still, once you've seen it, you'll see how wonderful it is. Who needs King Kong? Who needs the original Mighty Joe Young? Hell, who needs Planet Of The Apes?

I don't think kids under ten years old will notice it's deficiencies, most of which are caused by a far-fetched, predictable plot.In a situation obviously taken from Gorillas in the Mist, a woman scientist studying mountain gorillas in Africa is killed by poachers. This being a Disney production, she has her young daughter with her. The mother is gunned down while fleeing with a baby gorilla they have named Joe. Her dying request is that the child forever protect Joe. [Remember, I said kids would really like this movie. In fact, my brother and sister-in-law loved it. Of course, they also raved about George of the Jungle.]The daughter, Jill Young, grows up to be a strikingly beautiful young woman. She should be, since she is played by Charlize Theron, who is reminiscent of a young Rita Hayworth. Joe, a genetic anomaly, also grows up. He winds up being a 2,000 pound gorilla. Jill apparently never left the African village, and her education must have come from the scriptwriters. Jill and Joe are still best friends and run around playing hide and seek.Enter Greg [Bill Paxton], a doctor of something or other, who has come looking for a rumored giant gorilla. He finds Joe, who would have stomped on him, if Jill hadn't come along. Greg convinces Jill that Joe would be safer in a wildlife refuge outside of Los Angeles. She finally agrees, and somehow they transport the huge animal without anyone finding out. The writers certainly had no idea how this was done. In one scene, Joe is in Africa. In the next, he is in a big rig on an LA freeway.The refuge is full of stock characters. There is the kindly but incompetent Director. We have the Chairman of the Board, who is interested in Joe only as a way of getting donations. The villains, of course, are the very same poachers who devastated Jill and Joe's lives. Joe recognizes them before Jill does. This is one smart gorilla, and he soon escapes, reeking some wonderful havoc on, appropriately enough, HollywoodBoth Paxton and Theron are excellent actors, and they do their very best with the material they were given. Their careers remain in great shape.Both the regular and the computer special effects are excellent in Mighty Joe Young. While I was watching it, I didn't think the African scenes looked very authentic. As it turns out, the movie was filmed in Hawaii.Again, kids will thoroughly enjoy this adventure. Parents should find it tolerable, except for those who are like my brother. He thought it should have been nominated for Best Picture.

Sure, some of the special effects are a little rough. But sure, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a wonderful entertaining movie, sure to bring a little tear to the eye, and entertain even the hardest cynic.  In updating the 1949 classic, director Ron Underwood (who gave us the first TREMORS)has pleasantly remade the original to make it more accessible to these ever changing times.  From the opening scenes where little Mika Boorem (Hearts of Atlantis) and her doctor mommy Linda Purl are besieged by heartless poachers to the last thirty minutes where some really exciting climactic action scenes occur, MIGHTY JOE YOUNG delivers the poignant tale of an oversized gorilla who just wants to be loved.  The special effects crew do a fine job on giving Joe his own personality with the especially effective use of Joe's eyes, and ironically, he and Charlize Theron have a remarkable screen chemistry, actually better than her chemistry with co-star Bill Paxton.  But then the movie isn't really about Paxton and Theron; it's about Joe and Charlize.  The dynamic Regina King (from RAY) does a nice turn as the doctor who also bonds with Joe; and even self-centered David Paymer as the conservancy head finally warms up to Joe.  Of course, a movie like this would be nothing without villains, and we have two good ones here:  Croatian actor Rade Sherbedgia wants revenge on Joe because after shooting Theron's mother, he loses a finger and thumb to the then infant Joe; Peter Firth (Equus) is the more compassionate (?) sidekick who claims that Rade is ""not a hunter, but a murderer.""

Having said that, I think both versions are worth owning. There is a common thread that runs through both the original and this remake, and both share a somewhat similar climatic ending.

Joe looks so real, it will blow your mind! A sweet tearjerker that the whole family will enjoy. The remake MJY was filmed in Color and Widescreen.With the original ""Mighty Joe Young"" you don't get the state-of-the-art special effects of the remake, but what you do get is a much better story which tugs at all your emotions.

The original MJY was filmed in Black & White and Full Screen.Great news, this film is finally being released in November 2005 along with the original ""King Kong"" and ""Son of Kong"" as a special collection. It most likely will be available as a single DVD as well.

I was expecting a King Kong &quot;rip off&quot; which had been  given a Free Willy style plot, that would be purely for kids.  The main  problem I usually have with movies about Gorillas, and associated this with  Mighty Joe young, is that they seem to be the one animal that effects  people still haven't quite been able to perfect yet and always feel fake.  In fact the only reason I watched this movie in the first place was because  I was bored and my friend had left a copy at my house...oh the joys of  fate!This is an enchanting tale that will capture kids and adults  alike, with its story of a giant gorilla that is taken to America to keep  it &quot;safe&quot; away from poachers.  But of course, things don't go as  planned  and a heart warming struggle to help Joe find safety and happiness  ensues.  It basically is an alternative telling of the King Kong story, but  it does with grace and a charm that only Disney can provide. The beautiful  Charlize Theron is perfect in her jungle woman role and works superbly  alongside Bill Paxton.  Although the effects still aren't perfect, they are  the best gorilla effects I have seen in a movie; at least they don't make  you cringe.The sound and picture quality on the dvd are very good, but  the extra features (or lack of them) lets down the film.  An insight into  the effects would have been good, but no, you have to make do with a poxy  trailer and featurette.  But don't let this put you off.

Yikes! I just plugged myself!  The problem with Mighty Joe Young is the poachers that  are tied in with the story.  At times when they are hunting and harrasing  poor Joe, the movie switches gears from a sweet and tender story of an  oversized gorilla interacting with his &quot;adopted human parents&quot;  into a disturbingly dark and cruel poaching free-for-all.  I wanted to see  more of how Joe lived in his natural habitat (a lush tropical jungle).  Those scenes provided breathtaking scenery and allowed you to escape into a  landscape of green mountainous terrain filled with other wild animals and  exotic birds.  I also wanted to see more interaction with Joe and the other  characters who were not trying to harm him.  I thought the performances by  Bill Paxton and Charlisse Theron were as good as they could be, their  characters were a bit mild however. On a positive note, the special effects  were extrodinary. (Mighty Joe Young was nominated for an oscar in the  &quot;best special effects&quot; catagory). There are also some touching  moments when Joe is bonding with the humans.  But unfortunately there just  aren't enough of these scenes to go around.  If you must get your gorilla  fix, check out &quot;Congo&quot;.
