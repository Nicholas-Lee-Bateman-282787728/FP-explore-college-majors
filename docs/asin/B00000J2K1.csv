(actually three, if you count the almost, but not quite, lost in the shuffle sequel, MY SUMMER STORY.) the other (admittedly more obscure) masterwork is MURDER BY DECREE, which stylishly sets Sherlock Holmes on the trail of Jack The Ripper.but on the other hand, alas, Clark also directed such embarassments as that heir to ANIMAL HOUSE's throne, PORKY'S. (how is it possible, or fair, or LEGAL, for both PORKY'S and BABY GENIUSES to have sequels?) what's more, early works like BLACK CHRISTMAS and CHILDREN SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH DEAD THINGS have earned Clark the dubious distinction of being named one of the architects of my least favorite style of film, the slasher.so BABY GENIUSES irks me for most of the obvious reasons, but with a bonus. you frequently hear people ask ""How could [talented person] have possibly thought [terrible movie/tv series project] was worth it?"" well, like it or not, they sometimes do, and hideous duds like this are the result.it's oft been said that when it comes to a given movie, tv series, book, band, whatever, ""you either get it or you don't."" the implication here is if that you don't like it, it's because you don't ""get"" it. well, here's at least one time where the big problem is that we do get it. we get it all too clearly.i know of one, and only one, approving review of this film, specifically the one blurbed on the box calling it a ""live action RUGRATS."" well, personally, i never wanted a cartoon RUGRATS, either.",1,Someone Needs To Be SPANKED!!,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",2012,3203,"['definite', 'obvious', 'downside', 'being', 'movie', 'buff', 'get', 'constant', 'evidence', 'creativity', 'hit-and-miss', 'affair', 'such', 'thing', 'perfection', 'talent', 'certainly', 'IMperfection', 'talant', 'plenty', 'frequently', 'hear', 'actors', 'directors', 'work', 'always', 'sucks', 'when', 'did', 'last', 'hear', 'someone', 'who', 'hit', 'jackpot', 'single', 'effort', 'not', 'even', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'can', 'claim', 'much.BABY', 'GENIUSES', 'hardly', 'film', 'myriad', 'admirers', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'i', 'have', 'agree', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'film', 'most', 'significant', 'conclusively', 'once', 'babies', 'are', 'quote', 'cute', 'unquote', 'achieve', ""just-eat-'em-up"", 'level', 'adorable', 'commonly', 'attributed', 'only', 'character', 'babies', 'babies', 'portrayed', 'miniature', 'businessmen', 'fashion', 'models', 'pimps', 'well', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'i', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bit', 'surprised', 'learn', 'notion', 'same', 'genius', 'who', 'brought', 'sweaters', 'dogs', 'certainly', 'not', 'overrated', 'film', 'say', 'FORREST', 'GUMP', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'i', 'feel', 'need', 'write', 'phenomenon', 'mention', 'first', 'paragraph', 'wherein', 'just', 'participants', 'have', 'talent', ""n't"", 'give', 'guarantees', 'so', 'bang', 'not', 'content', 'sully', 'resumes', 'master', 'thespians', 'Kathleen', 'Turner', 'Christopher', 'Lloyd', 'Dom', 'DeLuise', 'stink-bomb', 'had', 'be', 'directed', 'Bob', 'Clark', 'Clark', 'directed', 'not', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'i', 'would', 'be', 'most', 'bummed', 'out', 'be', 'somehow', 'denied', 'opportunity', 'ever', 'see', 'again', 'most', 'obvious', 'would', 'be', 'A', 'CHRISTMAS', 'STORY', 'little', 'Ralphie', 'quest', 'Red', 'Ryder', 'BB', 'gun', 'actually', 'three', 'count', 'almost', 'not', 'quite', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'sequel', 'MY', 'SUMMER', 'STORY', 'other', 'admittedly', 'more', 'obscure', 'masterwork', 'MURDER', 'BY', 'DECREE', 'stylishly', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'trail', 'Jack', 'Ripper.but', 'other', 'hand', 'alas', 'Clark', 'also', 'directed', 'such', 'embarassments', 'heir', 'ANIMAL', 'HOUSE', 'throne', 'PORKY', 'how', 'possible', 'fair', 'LEGAL', 'PORKY', 'BABY', 'GENIUSES', 'have', 'sequels', 'what', 'more', 'early', 'works', 'BLACK', 'CHRISTMAS', 'CHILDREN', 'SHOULD', ""N'T"", 'PLAY', 'WITH', 'DEAD', 'THINGS', 'have', 'earned', 'Clark', 'dubious', 'distinction', 'being', 'named', 'one', 'architects', 'least', 'favorite', 'style', 'film', 'slasher.so', 'BABY', 'GENIUSES', 'most', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'bonus', 'frequently', 'hear', 'people', 'ask', 'How', 'could', '[', 'talented', 'person', ']', 'have', 'possibly', 'thought', '[', 'terrible', 'movie/tv', 'series', 'project', ']', 'was', 'well', 'not', 'sometimes', 'do', 'hideous', 'duds', 'are', 'result.it', 'oft', 'been', 'said', 'when', 'given', 'movie', 'tv', 'series', 'book', 'band', 'whatever', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'implication', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'well', 'here', 'least', 'one', 'time', 'where', 'big', 'problem', 'do', 'get', 'get', 'too', 'clearly.i', 'know', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'approving', 'review', 'film', 'specifically', 'one', 'blurbed', 'box', 'calling', 'live', 'action', 'RUGRATS', 'well', 'personally', 'i', 'never', 'wanted', 'cartoon', 'RUGRATS', 'either']",N/A

We mutually agreed (they were 5 and 7) to shut it the hell down and go make s'mores.When ""Body Heat"" debuted in 1981, first time director (yes, it WAS 22 years ago) Lawrence Kasden sealed his career success by debuting a stylish, 40's film noir and coaxing great performances from bad boys William Hurt, Mickey Rourke and Ted Danson (OK,OK, Ted's not a bad boy, but you get my drift). Bursting on the scene like a cat on the prowl was amazing actress and bodyKathleen Turner. Let's face it, the ice cubes in the bathtub scene and the Lauren Bacall voice- channeling made Kathleen one of Hollywood's hottest prospects.It's sad to thing that, 18 years later and a few good films later, Hollywood has so few roles for older women that Kathleen was reduced to this dreck.Turner gets dragged through the scenes with some actors of comic note: Christopher Lloyd, Peter MacNichol, Dom Deluise (at least he looks comedic, I don't pass judgement on his normal schtick. ).The visual effects suck, the tone is histrionic, and director Bob Clark III (How could he give us ""A Christmas Story"" with Peter Billingsley, and actually allow this film to air? Wasn't he afraid? Was he out of his mind?....maybe, he's also the man behind the ""Porky's"" flicks). somehow brings this bomb to a conclusion.

The whole story involves Dr.Kinder(played by Kathleen Turner) believes that babies hold the key to life's mysteries through their gibberish. So the quack kidnaps kids and holds them in a facility to test her inane theory. One of the babies named Sylvester escapes, they go looking for Sylvester and kidnap the wrong baby and Sylvester comes to the baby's rescue. The jokes fall flat and they have a bad tendency to repeat a lame joke about poop several times. Diaper gravy is not funny and it will never be! All the crummy jokes and gags are not the only flaw of this movie. Kathleen Turner is at her worst here and the rest of the cast is just awful.
