You tempted us with the first four seasons and then you just cut us off with no reason as to why the rest of the series was going to take forever for us get ahold of. As I have said before we work hard for the money that we earn to buy these series that we love to watch so much so why do you make us wait so long to finish our collections? Give us some relief and let us purchase the rest of this series. Thank you very much.,4,What is the hold-up???,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",2013,491,"['What', 'hold-up', 'releasing', 'rest', 'great', 'series', 'tempted', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'then', 'just', 'cut', 'off', 'reason', 'why', 'rest', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'forever', 'get', 'ahold', 'have', 'said', 'work', 'hard', 'money', 'earn', 'buy', 'series', 'love', 'watch', 'so', 'much', 'why', 'do', 'make', 'wait', 'so', 'long', 'finish', 'collections', 'Give', 'relief', 'let', 'purchase', 'rest', 'series', 'Thank', 'very', 'much']",N/A

Why do they only make so many seasons and then when you are really into it, there aren't anymore to buy.  Why does it take years to put out another season or is it because they think that people are willing to pay more when the next season finally comes out if they had to wait years?

1384984,A3E3HHHYYX4AMS,B0044A5BPQ,Mike,"[4, 4]",I used to watch this show when I was a kid.I am over the moon that this show is now available on dvd.Raymond Burr was one of the best actor's of his generation.First he had a hit with Perry Mason and then with Ironside.He was the  consummate professional and this is one of the best cop shows ever.All the supporting cast were excellent in their roles.Being the fourth season this was the last outing for Barbara Anderson as Officer Eve Whitfield.She would be replaced in season five.Anybody who loves cop shows will love this series.Set in the late 1960's it depicted the hippie and flower power era in San Francisco in it's early seasons.Plenty of big name guest stars appeared throughout the series.Also it had a great theme song by Quincy Jones.This is American TV at it's best.I don't know if any more seasons are to be released as I believe that Shout Factory only has the rights to the first four seasons.Also these are not for sale in the shops but has to be ordered through Shout Factory or Amazon.But a big thank you goes to Shout for managing to release these seasons anyway.,5,Raymond Burr:A cut above the rest,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1086,"['used', 'watch', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'kid.I', 'am', 'moon', 'show', 'now', 'available', 'dvd.Raymond', 'Burr', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'actor', 'generation.First', 'had', 'hit', 'Perry', 'Mason', 'then', 'Ironside.He', 'was', 'consummate', 'professional', 'one', 'best', 'cop', 'ever.All', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'excellent', 'roles.Being', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'last', 'outing', 'Barbara', 'Anderson', 'Officer', 'Eve', 'Whitfield.She', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'season', 'five.Anybody', 'who', 'cop', 'shows', 'will', 'love', 'series.Set', 'late', '1960', 'depicted', 'hippie', 'flower', 'power', 'era', 'San', 'Francisco', 'early', 'seasons.Plenty', 'big', 'name', 'guest', 'stars', 'appeared', 'series.Also', 'had', 'great', 'theme', 'song', 'Quincy', 'Jones.This', 'American', 'TV', 'best.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'seasons', 'are', 'be', 'released', 'believe', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'only', 'rights', 'first', 'four', 'seasons.Also', 'are', 'not', 'sale', 'shops', 'be', 'ordered', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'Amazon.But', 'big', 'thank', 'Shout', 'managing', 'release', 'seasons', 'anyway']",N/A
