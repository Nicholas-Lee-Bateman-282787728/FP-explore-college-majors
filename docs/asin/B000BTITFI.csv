949630,A1XACK4QK1K3P2,B000BTITFI,Amazon Customer,"[4, 4]","I just bought this DVD on December 13th and today is the 17th and I've probably watched it 10 times already. Various family members have watched it with me repeatedly because it's a feel-good movie. It makes you remember the innocence of youth and the times when you were unsure of what the future would bring. I enjoyed Bow Wow's portrayal so much and think if he ever wanted to give up rapping, acting would be a good job for him to flourish in.Brandon Jackson as Junior was also excellent in this movie, as were the other group of boys who helped Xavier (Bow Wow) overcome the passing of his mother and the tension with his father. Xavier and Curtis (Chi) had great father-and-son chemistry and I hope to see them together in something else in the future.It was nice seeing Meagan and Jurnee team up once again (Eve's Bayou being their first movie together) and enjoyed the fact that two girls hanging around the same boy could be friends and not jealous adversaries.Kudos to Mike Epps and Charlie Murphy for bringing the laughs... the pair were great with the delivery of their lines and had me busting a gut everytime they were on. Ricky Gonzalez as Naps and Marcus T. Paulk as Boo and Khleo Thomas asWhite Mike were equally amusing and entertaining to watch.And Wesley Jonathan was great as Sweetness. He didn't have many lines but the man is FIONE beyond words and has the sexiest lips and rock-hard chest! I loved how the girls and women went nuts whenever Sweetness appeared on the screen. Sweetness and Xavier's rivalry on skates was breathtaking to watch. The choreography was too much. I didn't know watching others roller skating could be just as fun as doing it yourself.I sure wish we could get more African American movies like this. There was no shooting, no women being called derogatory names, and good soulful music making the movie a breath of fresh air. And the script was just plain fun, with heartbreaking moments, awkwardness between teenagers coming of age, and always kept a smile on my face.I'd give this movie 10 stars if I could. The acting was great, the music wonderful, and never had a dull moment. Bow Wow and the gang has a winner here.And who else remembered all-night skating whenever they showed the actors skating? It's been a while since I skated but this movie makes me want to go out and put on a pair and boogie oogie til I just can't boogie no more :)",5,"Bow Wow's a great little actor, and the movie is great too!",1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2395,"['just', 'bought', 'DVD', 'December', '13th', 'today', '17th', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'watched', '10', 'times', 'already', 'Various', 'family', 'members', 'have', 'watched', 'repeatedly', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'remember', 'innocence', 'youth', 'times', 'when', 'were', 'unsure', 'what', 'future', 'would', 'bring', 'enjoyed', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'portrayal', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'ever', 'wanted', 'give', 'up', 'rapping', 'acting', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'job', 'flourish', 'in.Brandon', 'Jackson', 'Junior', 'was', 'also', 'excellent', 'movie', 'were', 'other', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'helped', 'Xavier', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'overcome', 'passing', 'mother', 'tension', 'father', 'Xavier', 'Curtis', 'Chi', 'had', 'great', 'father-and-son', 'chemistry', 'hope', 'see', 'together', 'something', 'else', 'future.It', 'was', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Meagan', 'Jurnee', 'team', 'up', 'once', 'again', 'Eve', 'Bayou', 'being', 'first', 'movie', 'together', 'enjoyed', 'fact', 'two', 'girls', 'hanging', 'same', 'boy', 'could', 'be', 'friends', 'not', 'jealous', 'adversaries.Kudos', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'bringing', 'laughs', 'pair', 'were', 'great', 'delivery', 'lines', 'had', 'busting', 'gut', 'everytime', 'were', 'Ricky', 'Gonzalez', 'Naps', 'Marcus', 'T.', 'Paulk', 'Boo', 'Khleo', 'Thomas', 'asWhite', 'Mike', 'were', 'equally', 'amusing', 'entertaining', 'watch.And', 'Wesley', 'Jonathan', 'was', 'great', 'Sweetness', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'lines', 'man', 'FIONE', 'words', 'sexiest', 'lips', 'rock-hard', 'chest', 'loved', 'how', 'girls', 'women', 'went', 'nuts', 'whenever', 'Sweetness', 'appeared', 'screen', 'Sweetness', 'Xavier', 'rivalry', 'skates', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'watch', 'choreography', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'watching', 'others', 'roller', 'skating', 'could', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'fun', 'doing', 'yourself.I', 'sure', 'wish', 'could', 'get', 'more', 'African', 'American', 'movies', 'was', 'shooting', 'women', 'being', 'called', 'derogatory', 'names', 'good', 'soulful', 'music', 'making', 'movie', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'script', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'fun', 'heartbreaking', 'moments', 'awkwardness', 'teenagers', 'coming', 'age', 'always', 'kept', 'smile', 'face.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'movie', '10', 'stars', 'could', 'acting', 'was', 'great', 'music', 'wonderful', 'never', 'had', 'dull', 'moment', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'gang', 'winner', 'here.And', 'who', 'else', 'remembered', 'all-night', 'skating', 'whenever', 'showed', 'actors', 'skating', 'been', 'while', 'skated', 'movie', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'put', 'pair', 'boogie', 'oogie', 'til', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'boogie', 'more']",Roll Bounce

COME ON!), but they put it on while I was in the living room, and I was really drawn into it.First of all, as a young teenager in the late 70s myself who would occasionally go to a skating rink (to watch more than anything else), they really got the period atmosphere right. This was obviously written by somebody who was there at the time.Secondly, the bond between Bow Wow and Chi McBride as the father and son is quite heartwarming in the wake of his mother's death, as well as his bond with his friends.And yes, there's the music and dancing.

949647,A15Q9YEG1XPEJN,B000BTITFI,Get What We Give,"[15, 17]","It is terribly unfortunate that Roll Bounce came and went to the theater without much notice. It is unfortunate, because it is the kind of film that people should be watching today. It is a heartwarming, life affirming film about five boyhood friends who want to do nothing more than be able to skate (roller not in line) at their favorite roller rink.The time is somewhere around 1978 and the boys are all black. It's a black film right? Wrong!The script is not unique in its overall direction, because we've seen similar in Saturday Night Fever and Rocky. While the roller skating could be equated with the dancing from S N Fever, the emotional context of this film share far more in line with Rocky.The race of the characters has nothing to do with the film and yet it has everything to do with the film. Huh?It has nothing to do with the film, because the characters are real, living and breathing people with real problems. And yet, there is no discussion of drugs, gangs, or guns. Oh there's a sexual aspect to the film, but of the ""wholesome"" variety. We see how young boys react to looking at beautiful girls and how men deal with being ""on the market"" to single women. It's funny and charming, not base or purile.Race has everything to do with this film too, because it demonstrates that a film made by and for the black community doesn't have to rely on four letter words, sex, drugs, gangs, and guns to be good (Not one pimp or prostitute is present). It demonstrates that films of social significance can be made highlighting the best parts of the black community not the worst.So what's it about?Xavier - or X as his friends call him (Bow Wow) and his buddies are all avid roller skaters. Unfortunately their hangout - a roller rink - gets closed down. They must now travel to the north side of town, which is more white than their side of town. None of these boys are poor, but they don't come from wealthy families either - they're middle class. Yet when they arrive at the north side roller rink, many of the people there, including other black folks, treat them like trash. This is cause for the conflict in the film - rather than act like thugs, they do the Hollywood thing and challenge each other to a roller skating contest.Their is a human element at work in this film that is leaps and bounds above most others. The boys rag on each other and talk bad about each other's mothers. It's all in good fun - and it's a heck of a lot of fun for us too. It's a drama with lots of comic touches - but first and foremost it's a roller skating film done the way they should have been when they were first made - actually back in the 1970's.X's father (Chi McBride) is a highly educated man, but, in part, due to his race, he cannot get a decent job and is forced to take demeaning work in order to support his children (another emotional link in this film is that X's mother has recently passed away and no one has yet faced this reality fully).The skating is dynamite and is fun to watch.

949650,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B000BTITFI,Jason,"[0, 15]","In perhaps the stupidest movie concept of all time, Bow Wow leads a cast of young, mostly black actors, who will stoop so low as to ""star"" in a ""movie"" with someone named ""Bow Wow"".  Roll Bounce has as much heartfelt drama as gastrointestinal surgery, and does nothing but create a black hole of suckage from which no serious actor will ever emerge.  When this movie gets approved, you know the integrity is at an all time low in Hollywood.The premise is simple enough: kids dance-skate in competitions.  Bow Wow is their leader, and he leads in the most pathetic way possible, with bad acting, idiotic lines, and a collection of scenes only a mother could love.  It's truly awkward, in a ""parents catching their teenagers having sex""-way.  The circular skating rink action reminded me of nothing more than a turd circling the bowl, except the movie stinks slightly more.Of course there is some sort of strife, some challenge to be overcome.  Naturally, it pits the stereotypical, down on their luck, once-dissed group of Bow Wow sycophants versus the rich, bad guys, who happen to be a tad whiter - evidently it's a necessity to divide among racial lines in order to get anyone to like this movie.  Of course, the eventual ultimate battle, the most foreshadowed and anti-climactic climax in the history of cinema pits Bow Wow against a skating version of Afro Ninja.  The movie is replete with 70s slang, teenage cracks that can only make an imbecile laugh, and contrived situational humor written into the script by someone with a sense of humor similar to people who laugh at the jokes on America's Funniest Home Videos.The only redeemable aspect of this movie is that Charlie Murphy makes multiple cameo appearances.

One thing that was revealed was that most Americans have roller skated at some point in their lives. The other thing that was revealed was how difficult it was to get the movie made. Why is it that a movie about an exciting activity would be such a hard sell to a movie company?Roller skating isn't what it used to be. The time of the roller skating ring is quietly fading away with other such popular things of the 1970s, such as drive-thru movies and lava lamps. Of course, a movie based in the year 2006 about roller skating may have been an even tougher sell. This is why the movie ""Roll Bounce"" was based in the seventies.The movie probably won't make you want to put on your skates and try the latest skating move. It fails in attempts to make roller skating look like the coolest thing on the block. However, it will bring back memories about a simpler time in life. This is because Bow Wow (known as X in the movie) and his friends have nothing better to do than run a newspaper route and go roller skating. The plot of the movie is simple and predictable. The movie is so simple that it garners the label of being a family friendly film quite easily.The movie consists of three basic elements. Those elements are: your momma style jokes, roller skating moves, and the seventies.

I honestly felt like I was back in the late '70s, during the days of Jimmy Carter, ""What's Happening"", and Fat Albert, which are all mentioned during the course of the film. The music, and pop culture references are very accurate. Of course, when the song ""Roll Bounce"" is played, I couldn't help but smile, and point out that song came out in 1980, but with that being the title of the movie, I let that one pass;-) I only noticed one small error in regards to '70s life. This was the scene where the guys are watching ""Soul Train"" one afternoon. The stage/setting was not like that in 1978. It looked more like a clip from around 1972 instead. Again, this is such of a minor oversight, it does not at all take away from the movie. The feel and essence of the late '70s is captured beautifully. There was a simplicity then which I cannot quite describe, but then again, I do not have to. The movie did it for me! I could not believe the the precision.

But that is the movie that director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man"") and writer Norman Vance, Jr. (""Beauty Shop"") put together.  You knew that after ""Like Mike"" the day would come when Lil' Bow Wow would want to grow up, and that he did this movie will certainly help him make the transition.""Roll Bounce"" is set in the 1970s during the disco era and starts off in the south side of Chicago.  That is where ""X"" (Bow Wow) and his friends hang out at the Palisades, the local skating rink.  But then it is shut down and their only option is to check out the Sweetwater rink on the north side of town.  In other words these kids are going to go from White Sox territory into Cub territory, and find things are different.  The place totally looks uptown and the cock of the walk is Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan), a disco roller skater whose male backup skaters announce his arrival and who has a trio of sexy ladies who worship him from up close and personal while the rest of the ground swoons at his every move.Clearly at the climax of this movie X and his friends are going to take on Sweetness and his boys in the big disco roller skating contest.  But there are some other pertinent subplots that give this movie depth.  X's mother has died and he and his father, Curtis (Chi McBride) are having a contest to see if the boy misses his mother more than the husband misses his wife.  Complicating things are the fact that Curtis has lost his job, but is too proud to admit the fact.  Meanwhile, while X is friendly with Tori (Jurnee Smollett), the girl next door who might have braces on her teeth but can still carve up the boys with her tongue when they make lame jokes, he is attracted to Naomi (Meagan Good).  You would think there would be a standard adolescent love triangle here, but Tori thinks that X should date Naomi.  That is because Tori's mom, Vivian (Kellita Smith), shows up to yell at Curtis about something and he yells back, so if you think about it you know Tori and X will be living in the same house sometime after the credits roll.I would think that the roller skating done by X and Sweetness at the end of the film is a lot better than what was actually happening at that time, but it is not like this coming of age film is trying to document such things.  One of the many things I liked about this film was that Sweetness is not just the bad guy, but he is really good at what he does.  He may have an oversized ego, but he has good reason to have one given what we see him do in this movie.  I would need Dick Button or Stacy Peralta or somebody to explain to me why one of these guys is better than the other because except for our rooting interest in X they look to me like they are both in a league of their own.  But before we get to the big skate off ""Roll Bounce"" pays its dues by treating the emotions of the characters seriously.  For me the pivotal scene is when X finally explodes and the violence does not begat more violence, not only because of Vance's script but also because of McBride's strong performance.  Violating expectations in a familiar storyline is always a good sign.It really is amazing this movie was made and while I suppose it would be possible to write some sort of academic treatise on how the film subverts blaxplotation flicks of that period (not to mention the entire reign of disco), I would much rather prefer to just enjoy the film on its own terms.  All things considered, Bow Wow seems like a real kid, even when he is on the dance floor doing his thing, and this film avoids skating off into the land of perpetual stereotypes (try not to be distracted by thoughts of what other writers, directors and actors would have done with this film that would have turned it into just another forgettable comedy).  In the end I rounded up on this film simply because I would like to see the people who did this film make more in a similar vein.

949663,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,B000BTITFI,Mike,"[0, 0]","Synopsis:  It's Chicago in 1978.  Xavier ""X"" Smith (Bow Wow) has aspirations of being a top roller skater.  Adversity is working against him though, as his mother died leaving his dad (Chi McBride) to raise he and his sister on a working class income.  Unfortunately, the local roller rink had to close, forcing he and his friends to go to the Sweetwater roller rink, which is in a more upper-class (read: snobby) neighborhood.  X and his crew get belittled by the rink's clerk Bernard (Nick Cannon) while getting shown up by the Sweetwater Rollers and the star of the rink, a skater with the gift of game named Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan).  Despite all that, X remains affirmed by his loyal friend Naomi (Meagan Good), with whom the relationship starts to turn romantic.  Meanwhile, his dad is going through the struggles of adjusting to single fatherhood while trying to give his son the right direction in life.  How will he and his dad end up?  And will X be able to prove to everyone he can be an elite roller skater?Now, I was changing through the channels when I left whatever station that was broadcasting this on.  I came back, it was starting and I was like ""Bow Wow and Nick Cannon?  I dunno...""  But then I noticed Chi McBride (who's actually one of my favorite actors as of late) so I was like ""... go on..."" and decided to watch the film.  I'm glad I changed my mind because I really liked it, and if you met me you'd probably be like ""Uh, YOU liked this movie?""  You're darn right I did, and I'd be glad to watch it again too!What I dug most about it was the message that I took away from it:  It's better to strike out swinging than it is to not step up to the plate at all because even if all you did was try, you still get respect whether you're successful or not.  The movie's protagonists did have hardship to overcome, but everything was remarkably affirmative without being predictable.  I was also a fan of all the cameos in the film, as Charlie Murphy, Mike Epps, and Wayne Brady all made appearances in the movie.I recommend it and especially recommend it for teens and families who'd find the material age appropriate for their kids (really, aside from some occasional language and crude humor, there wasn't much that I'd consider objectionable.)",4,A good teen film that anyone can enjoy.,1240012800,"04 18, 2009",2009,2272,"['Synopsis', 'Chicago', '1978', 'Xavier', 'X', 'Smith', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'aspirations', 'being', 'top', 'roller', 'skater', 'Adversity', 'working', 'though', 'mother', 'died', 'leaving', 'dad', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'raise', 'sister', 'working', 'class', 'income', 'Unfortunately', 'local', 'roller', 'rink', 'had', 'close', 'forcing', 'friends', 'go', 'Sweetwater', 'roller', 'rink', 'more', 'upper-class', 'read', 'snobby', 'neighborhood', 'X', 'crew', 'get', 'belittled', 'rink', 'clerk', 'Bernard', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'getting', 'shown', 'up', 'Sweetwater', 'Rollers', 'star', 'rink', 'skater', 'gift', 'game', 'named', 'Sweetness', 'Wesley', 'Jonathan', 'X', 'remains', 'affirmed', 'loyal', 'friend', 'Naomi', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'whom', 'relationship', 'turn', 'romantic', 'Meanwhile', 'dad', 'going', 'struggles', 'adjusting', 'single', 'fatherhood', 'trying', 'give', 'son', 'right', 'direction', 'life', 'How', 'will', 'dad', 'end', 'up', 'will', 'X', 'be', 'able', 'prove', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'elite', 'roller', 'skater', 'Now', 'was', 'changing', 'channels', 'when', 'left', 'station', 'was', 'broadcasting', 'came', 'back', 'was', 'starting', 'was', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'dunno', 'then', 'noticed', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'who', 'actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'late', 'so', 'was', 'go', 'decided', 'watch', 'film', ""'m"", 'glad', 'changed', 'mind', 'really', 'liked', 'met', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'Uh', 'YOU', 'liked', 'movie', ""'re"", 'darn', 'right', 'did', ""'d"", 'be', 'glad', 'watch', 'again', 'too', 'What', 'dug', 'most', 'was', 'message', 'took', 'away', 'better', 'strike', 'out', 'swinging', 'not', 'step', 'up', 'plate', 'because', 'even', 'did', 'was', 'try', 'still', 'get', 'respect', ""'re"", 'successful', 'not', 'movie', 'protagonists', 'did', 'have', 'hardship', 'overcome', 'everything', 'was', 'remarkably', 'affirmative', 'being', 'predictable', 'was', 'also', 'fan', 'cameos', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Murphy', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'Wayne', 'Brady', 'all', 'made', 'appearances', 'movie.I', 'recommend', 'especially', 'recommend', 'teens', 'families', 'who', ""'d"", 'find', 'material', 'age', 'appropriate', 'kids', 'really', 'aside', 'occasional', 'language', 'crude', 'humor', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', ""'d"", 'consider', 'objectionable']",Roll Bounce

949667,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B000BTITFI,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[0, 0]","Roll Bounce is probably one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a few years. The acting was good, the dialogue was good, the skating scenes were fantastic. I'm not a Bow Wow music fan but I was impressed by his acting abilities here. Most of the actors were good except for Meagan Good who seemed too uncomfortable for anyone to take seriously. Other than Xavier(Bow Wow), the rest of the characters are very wooden but the actors do their best to display the differences in personalities. By the first five minutes you begin to figure out that Xavier's friends are just there so he can have someone to talk to for five minutes. Other than skating together, his friends didn't seem necessary which was a shame because the supporting actors were very interesting to see at times. You really get the point that X's friends aren't of much importance during the skate-off. I kept wondering how come X's father was the only parent to show up? Didn't these other children have families? It was like the story didn't want to delve into the supporting characters enough to make the story more realistic. A lot of actors were wasted to be honest. Chi McBride (X's father) is the backbone of X's homelife problems yet the man is on screen less than X's friends. Mike Epps is wasted though extremely hilarious as the neighborhood garbage man. The biggest waste was Nick Cannon's character, Benard. Anyone could have played this teeny part and it made me wonder if Cannon owed the director a favor since he was only shown about twice in the movie. And he was one of the funniest chracters! Jurnee Smollett was probably the most entertaining of X's friends because she wasn't wooden but vibrant and brought life to her character more than many in the film. I would have rather seen her as X's love interest. Bow Wow and Smollett's chemistry surpassed every scene Bow Wow had with Meagan Good by a long shot. And Meagan Good...well she just didn't fit. It was obvious that she is much older than Bow Wow and the others yet trying desperately to play the teenage role even though she looks thirty. It didn't work which left her character completely out of place. The actor who played Sweetness stole the show many times which made me wonder if his scenes were limited on purpose so he wouldn't show Bow Wow up. Sweetness's scenes were few but probably the best in the movie.Also the writers needed to brush up on their 70's trends. Much of the dialogue used in the film was straight from today. I can't count how many times the characters said "" tripping "". I don't believe they said tripping in the 70's. The look of the 70's was done beautifully with the exception of Meagan Good who didn't look like she was anywhere near the 70's.Don't expect much to be different mind you. Most of this story has been done before it's just that Roll Bounce added skating, disco and pushed us back to the 70's. Despite it being cliched this movie still stands up above many films that came out in 2005. Very entertaining. I recommend it to everyone. It's the perfect family film for people of all ages and races.Also the best music of the 70's was played in this movie!",4,Nothing New But Very Enjoyable,1156032000,"08 20, 2006",2006,3149,"['Roll', 'Bounce', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'years', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'dialogue', 'was', 'good', 'skating', 'scenes', 'were', 'fantastic', ""'m"", 'not', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'music', 'fan', 'was', 'impressed', 'acting', 'abilities', 'here', 'Most', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'who', 'seemed', 'too', 'uncomfortable', 'anyone', 'take', 'seriously', 'Other', 'Xavier', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'rest', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'wooden', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'display', 'differences', 'personalities', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'begin', 'figure', 'out', 'Xavier', 'friends', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'so', 'can', 'have', 'someone', 'talk', 'five', 'minutes', 'Other', 'skating', 'together', 'friends', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessary', 'was', 'shame', 'supporting', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'see', 'times', 'really', 'get', 'point', 'X', 'friends', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'importance', 'skate-off', 'kept', 'wondering', 'how', 'come', 'X', 'father', 'was', 'only', 'parent', 'show', 'up', 'Did', ""n't"", 'other', 'children', 'have', 'families', 'was', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'delve', 'supporting', 'characters', 'enough', 'make', 'story', 'more', 'realistic', 'lot', 'actors', 'were', 'wasted', 'be', 'honest', 'Chi', 'McBride', 'X', 'father', 'backbone', 'X', 'homelife', 'problems', 'yet', 'man', 'screen', 'less', 'X', 'friends', 'Mike', 'Epps', 'wasted', 'extremely', 'hilarious', 'neighborhood', 'garbage', 'man', 'biggest', 'waste', 'was', 'Nick', 'Cannon', 'character', 'Benard', 'Anyone', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'teeny', 'part', 'made', 'wonder', 'Cannon', 'owed', 'director', 'favor', 'was', 'only', 'shown', 'twice', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'chracters', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'was', 'probably', 'most', 'entertaining', 'X', 'friends', 'was', ""n't"", 'wooden', 'vibrant', 'brought', 'life', 'character', 'more', 'many', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'X', 'love', 'interest', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'Smollett', 'chemistry', 'surpassed', 'scene', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'had', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'long', 'shot', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'was', 'obvious', 'much', 'older', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'others', 'yet', 'trying', 'desperately', 'play', 'teenage', 'role', 'even', 'thirty', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'left', 'character', 'completely', 'place', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Sweetness', 'stole', 'show', 'many', 'times', 'made', 'wonder', 'scenes', 'were', 'limited', 'purpose', 'would', ""n't"", 'show', 'Bow', 'Wow', 'up', 'Sweetness', 'scenes', 'were', 'few', 'probably', 'best', 'movie.Also', 'writers', 'needed', 'brush', 'up', '70', 'trends', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'straight', 'today', 'ca', ""n't"", 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'characters', 'said', 'tripping', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'said', 'tripping', '70', 'look', '70', 'was', 'done', 'beautifully', 'exception', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'was', 'anywhere', ""70's.Do"", ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'be', 'different', 'mind', 'Most', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'just', 'Roll', 'Bounce', 'added', 'skating', 'disco', 'pushed', 'back', '70', 'being', 'cliched', 'movie', 'still', 'up', 'many', 'films', 'came', 'out', '2005', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'perfect', 'family', 'film', 'people', 'ages', 'races.Also', 'best', 'music', '70', 'was', 'played', 'movie']",Roll Bounce

I just never really wanted to watch it, but the first 5 minutes into the movie, it grabbed my attention. The movie was very colorful.  The music had and interesting mix of a 70s/disco feel to it.  I was diggin it.  The actors had a pretty goog chemistry with each other.  Bow Wow did an average acting job.  He still needs work.  But he did good.  I like the entire concept.  It wasnt your average : Contest-ghetto kids vs suburb kids movie where they need the money, or else something is gonna happen concept.  (like breakin, u got served, bring it on, etc).  Anyhow It was pretty humerous.  Nick Cannon, Wayne Brady, Charlie Murphy, Mike Epps, Meagan Good, McBride, They all did wonderful jobs in retaining the attention, and the theme of the movie.  What surprised me was the little girl fromEve's Bayou, who used to play Michelle's friend on Full House.  This girl turned into a cutie.  U know she and Meagan Good also played in Eve's Bayou together.  I never thought about that. also Sweetness (AKA Jammal from saturday morning TNBC's City Guys) he played a very convincing role as Sweetness.  Obviously Arrogant, but with a confident charm.

949674,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BTITFI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[3, 6]","Chicago, the summer of 1978. X (Bow Wow), short for Xavier, and his friends enjoy spending many hours skating at the local roller skating rink. When the skating rink closes, they attend the final skate like people attending a wake. His father, Curtis (Chi McBride, TV's ""Boston Public"", ""House""), who is having trouble finding a new job and mourning the loss of his wife, takes out his frustrations on his son. Curtis is trying to find a job as an engineer, and settles for a job as a janitor. Soon, X and his friends decide to start trekking to the north side and the Sweetwater Rink, which is much more elaborate, busy and full of people. There, they develop a rivalry with Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) and his team of four skaters who have dominated the big annual skate-off. X also becomes reacquainted with an old school friend, Naomi (Meagan Good), who moved to the north side and has now blossomed into a beautiful young lady.""Roll Bounce"", the newest film from director Malcolm Lee (""Undercover Brother""), a cousin of Spike, is a film with many problems, but the choreographed skating segments are fun and they help to offset the many narrative problems throughout.Set in the late 70s, the film has a certain amount of fun depicting that bygone era. When it does it right, the fun is infectious. At times, the depiction is attempted in an earnest way. X and his friends are into the music of the time and great music from Earth, Wind & Fire, Kool and the Gang and others fills the soundtrack. This is the type of music they love and skate to, so we hear a lot of it. We learn early on why X is so fond of skating and it is a little touching, making his character a little real to us. He wears the same old pair of skates, pretty much all day, either at the rink, in his neighborhood, or when he is out doing his paper route.When the film does it poorly, the fun grinds to a halt. At other times, the depictions become much more stereotypical and comical, not always with good results. Nick Cannon appears as a Skate Boy in the more upscale Sweetwater rink. He is basically the guy who rents out the skates, yet he thinks he is king of the rink, a real ladies man. His afro is huge and he seems to only talk in the stereotypical slang expressions of the day. Really, his character serves no purpose except to give one of X's friends the wrong size of skate on a consistent basis, a lame attempt at comedy. I suspect that the fact that Nick Cannon is a well-known celebrity among teens made his participation a selling point for the film. The role is actually embarrassing to watch because it is so over the top, unbelievable and not consistent with the better elements of the film. The role would be more fitting in a bad television sitcom.Wayne Brady also makes a brief appearance as a DJ for the big skate off. Hiding under a huge afro and wearing a dashiki and large sunglasses, he appears to not want to be recognized. Maybe this is a good thing because the role could be played by anyone; it really doesn't do anything for his resume.There is also a pervasive negative quality in how many of the characters treat each other. In one scene, when they arrive at the new skating rink, a white guy skates by, in tight white pants, doing ballet-like movements causing the kids to start making disparaging comments about homosexuals. When an Asian guy is present, disparaging comments about Asians. Thankfully, these moments are relatively few and far between. But the kids also bad mouth one another, in front of each other, they bad mouth friends when they aren't around. I could maybe understand how this would happen around a group of teens, but there is a scene in which Curtis, X's dad, attends a neighborhood party and there are comments and shots of women that are also more than a little denigrating. Why did anyone feel this was necessary? Perhaps it happened a lot during the time, if the film is in fact trying to accurately portray the period, but there doesn't seem to be any consequence for it and anyone in the demographic this film is aimed at (pre-teens and teens) might view this as acceptable behavior today. Let's move beyond this.The story is very earnest at points, trying to deal with X and his father's grief, both in different ways. As Curtis tries to deal with his grief, he hides his unemployment from his family, to protect his dignity. This story provides a nice counterpoint to the more sitcomy aspects of the comedy. There is also a pretty good relationship between X and his younger sister. But at others, the story is full of clich&eacute;s and melodrama. The resolution of the problems between X and his father seems rushed and forced; as though the filmmakers realized they were running out of time and needed to end things quickly. Tori (Jurnee Smollett), a young girl who becomes a part of X's group of friends, has huge braces on her teeth. Naturally, this prompts many of his friends, including Junior (Brandon Jackson) to start throwing barbs at her. Thankfully, she doesn't hesitate to return the insults. Later, she becomes a sort of Cupid to X and Naomi and then, just in time for the big Skate Off, the braces come off and she becomes a beautiful swan, falling in love with someone in a very predictable way. Her performance is good, but the writing is not. There is also a brief moment between Sonya (Busisiwe Irvin), Tori's single mom, and Curtis. Sonya starts yelling at Curtis for taking Tori to the skating rink with her son. Naturally, they soon start dating and caring for each other.But, the skating scenes are quite good. Because of X's love for his skates, he has them on all the time. If he isn't practicing in his neighborhood, he is skating through his paper route, grooving to his headphones, or he is skating at one of the rinks with his friends. He is quite good at it and is able to come up with some nice, choreographed moves. His friends are also good, possibly from hanging out with him all the time, I'm not sure, but they seem to love to skate. And it shows. As they become rivals to Sweetness' group, we see that they could actually beat the other team. But X and his friends recognize that they aren't quite that good and need to come up with some new routines. They start watching kung fu movies and looking everywhere for inspiration. These scenes are fun and accurately depict the joy these young skaters experience from this summer on wheels.If you are able to sit through the bad and mundane to get to the enjoyable skating scenes, then go to a bargain matinee. If not, rent the DVD and skip to the best moments.",3,2 1/2 stars - Joyous skating scenes help to offset narrative problems,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,6590,"['Chicago', 'summer', '1978', 'X',

949676,A3Q7DPS8UFNTRG,B000BTITFI,Venus A. Rachal,"[2, 2]","I rented this over the weekend not quite sure what to expect. As a kid, I loved skating (back when people still had wheels on both sides of their skates!). A friend of my mom's bought a roller-rink in the 80's and I just loved going to skate there!It was so funny to watch this movie because it brought back memories of childhood: skating, curfews, ""yo mama"" jokes...There is a joyful innocence about this movie which makes it endearing.X, short for Xavier, has just lost his mom and is living with his dad and younger sister. Still not over the loss, he wears skates that are obviously worn out because it was a favorite gift given by his mom. X's world takes another shift when the local roller rink is closed down. Now, he and his friends must travel to the North Side to go to the Sweetwater roller rink.At Sweetwater, their skating skills are tested by a group of kids led by the star skater of the city, Sweet...ness. Don't laugh when I write it that way, that's actually the way it's said and written in the film! X and his friends Boo, Naps, Junior, and another kid whose name I just forgot but who is known as the half-white kid in the movie (shame on them!) must come up with a new routine and prove their right to skate at Sweetwater. At the same time, X must continue to face the pain of his mother's death and his crumbling relationship with his father.Overall, Roll Bounce was a very fun movie. The skating was unique and exciting and the soundtrak was a fun flashback to the 70's.The only thing I wasn't comfortable with was the scene where Xavier confronts his father about the lie his father told (about his job and the location of their car). It was a little extreme in the context of the movie, though it did illustrate X's frustration with his father's apparent lack of emotion at the mother's death.Still, the movie is pretty well rounded out and the acting was good, though the Sweet...ness character was over the top. I particularly enjoyed Bow Wow and Jurnee Smollett (Tori in the film). Roll Bounce is up-beat and makes you want to get up and dance or break out the skates. As a side note, I hope that the popularity of the film brings a resurgence of Roller rinks.
