The film is assembled wonderfully and is moving beyond my wildest expectations!  This is real, and this is what goes on in a family of a gay or lesbian child.  The child should watch it with their parents so that the child can understand the process that their parents and siblings go through. It's a family event and it can bring a family together or tragically divide the family.  This film shows a bit of both along with some pretty hateful rhetoric from the right wing crowd.  The misinterpretations of Bible passages have caused so much unnecessary pain. This shows how a group of families deal with the hate that's heaped unjustly upon them and their gay and lesbian children.

I got to see...The completely predictable Christians arguing out of the book of Leviticus against homosexuality, seeming oblivious to the fact that neither Christians nor the secular world are bound by the Law of Moses.The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones pointing out that since Leviticus contains laws against eating foods that we know we can eat, and about mixing different kinds of cloth, that therefore the Levitical laws against homosexuality are invalid for us too.The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones invalidating Paul's obvious prohibition against homosexuality in Romans 1 (but I didn't predict that the reason given was that Paul simply could not envision long term monogamous homosexual relationships).  But Paul is rather obvious in his meaning in 1 cor 6:9 too.The completely predictable ""enlightened"" ones making it seem as though Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for their ""inhospitality"" rather than their sexual issues.  The ""enlightened"" ones missed, however, that Sodom and Gomorrah are mentioned many times later in scripture, not the least by Jude 1:7 in the New Testament as examples of those who give themselves up to sexual immorality.  So apparently Jude was unaware that the problem was really ""inhospitality"".Then there's the predictable Christian parents who have children who turn out to be homosexual; the discrediting of the Christain programs that claim to convert homosexuals back to heterosexuals; and of course, the footage of the young redneckish teen male who loves to beat up homosexuals, as though this represents Christianity of any flavor.  I'll stop there; wouldn't want to give away the ending.So what is worse, the Christians who waste their time trying to contain or control homosexuality through political means, or the ""enlightened"" ones who convince the biblically illiterate that there's nothing in the bible that condemns homosexuality?

It's aggressively polemical, it incorporates all the worst examples of Christian hate and extremism, it omits any treatment of gay extremists like you might see in San Francisco's Gay Pride Parade, and in several instances it presents ""experts"" without identifying them as aggressively pro-gay (eg, Peter Gomes of Harvard). But there's a good reason to watch this film, nevertheless, because it presents the personal stories of five families, without exception all of which are deeply Christian, and how they dealt with the news that their kids are gay. Two of the families are famous-- Chrissy Gephardt is the daughter of two-time presidential candidate and Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt, and Gene Robinson became the first openly gay bishop in the Episcopal Church. Jake comes from the suburbs of Minneapolis, Tonia is an African-American who grew up on a dirt road in North Carolina before going to Yale, and then Anna was from Arkansas. These families run the Christian gamut -- United Church of Christ, African-American, Lutheran, Catholic, and fundamentalist, and they respond to their child's coming out in different ways.

1119889,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,B000YHQNCI,,"[1, 3]","This DVD of ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" was recommended to me by one of my online friends with whom I'd discussed my Christian faith after being raised in a Jewish household.  The irony is, the recommender is a Jew, himself.  He said this documentary placed great emphasis on the church's negative stance on homosexuality.  I discovered quickly that the DVD was available in the library system of Indianapolis and reserved it immediately.  It took a couple of months to get here, but it was worth the wait.The interviews with figures such as Dr. Mel White, Bishop V. Gene Robinson, Jacob Reitan, his parents, Peter J. Gomes and all the others were enlightening and touching.  And, the archive footage of the opposition was properly childish and angering.  In college, I ran with the sort of people that openly judged gays and lesbians unfairly.  After graduation, I came to realize how mistaken they were.  After watching this disc, I immediately decided to someday purchase a copy of it.  In time, I bought it for both me and one of my dear friends.The most climactic part of the film for me was a segment near the end.  The Reitan family had ventured to the Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado Springs to present Dr. Jim Dobson with love propaganda. They were turned away without a word, the property was carted off, the shades pulled down and the authorities called in to prevent entrance.  It was pathetic the way the Reitans were arrested, because Dr. Dobson had put his fingers in his ears to block out what turned out just to be love propaganda.When I watched that segment for the first time, I was so enraged I nearly broke up one of my guitars.  But, what would that have achieved?  The anger would still be there, I'd have one less instrument to use for positive purposes, and Dr. Dobson would still be what I call ""a pseudo-theologian with a pseudo-reputation, spouting pseudo-spiritual lessons about a whole lot of nothing.  And, the only genuine article he's got is his silver hair.""  (Sorry, that's paraphrasing a line from an episode of the sitcom, A Different World.)  The man evidently suffers from a blind, ignorant stubbornness I call ""Brick Wall Syndrome.""  And, the arrest of the Reitans is a clear re-creation of the incident of Sodom when the angels were assaulted by the residents.  But, he is a human being, and there's always divine hope for any human.The Lord doesn't hate gays or lesbians anymore than he hates blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, believers in Shinto, Universalist Unitarians, non-believers - or anybody.  He doesn't hate the United States of America.  And, He doesn't hate the Episcopal Church.  He couldn't possibly see the use of apartheid, the degradation of women, revoking their right to choose or insulting other peoples' creeds, either.

This film ""cuts"" through all previous rhetoric that has been screamed and taught about the aforesaid subject by so-called""Bble experts"".

That's really the answer all of the 5 families found to be true that it all comes down to loving NOT hating.

The part where it started to confuse me was when the film started to question what the bible's passages on homosexuality actually say. Should it be read literally or is it dependent upon cultural, individual interpretation?I think that if a person wants to believe in the bible, they should believe in what the bible has written down. There might be room and leeway for some interpretation (as with all books), but to try and make the jump from the bible condemning homosexuality to accepting/or not mentioning it...that seems like a far stretch to me. It seems as if some of the people in the film are choosing what they want to believe and then trying to find a way to fit the bible around it...shouldn't it be the other way around? If you are going to be Christian, shouldn't you look at what the bible says, and then live life in accordance with what it proclaims?Either way...there is some cognitive dissonance going on.

1119895,A34X9EZTTQR7R7,B000YHQNCI,,"[3, 4]","""For the Bible Tells Me So"" (FBTMS) by director Daniel Karslake is an interesting movie on many levels.  Most superficially, it is a documentary illustrating how many religious leaders have held aloft homosexuality as a convenient demon through which to influence their flock.  Through candid interviews with several individuals and their parents, the movie follows the personal evolution of families that are coming to gripes with the realization that their child is not straight.  More fascinating is that three of these families contain parents and/or children who are practicing pastors or ministers.Gene Robinson ignited waves of controversy, discussion, and hatred when he was elected as a bishop in the Anglican Church in 2004.  The issue was that Bishop Gene Robinson was an openly gay, non-celibate priest.  In several interviews with him and his parents, we have a glimpse into the spiritual torture of a man who suffers inner torment as he confronts his failed marriage, his parents, and finally his faith after he accepts who he is.  We are able to share in his ultimate vindication towards the end of the film as he is ushered in as bishop, not to cries of rage, but to cheers of joy.Chrissy Gephardt, daughter of yesteryear's presidential hopeful Richard Gephardt, brings the viewer along during her struggle with sexuality.  Chrissy also encounters anguish within a loving, but passionless, marriage.  Ultimately, she informs her parents that she is gay--far from rejecting her, they embrace their daughter and offer her a place on the presidential-election campaign staff.  In her own words, she felt acceptance beyond anything she had expected during the campaign.Delving deeper into the movie, the viewer is presented arguments which attack two of the fundamentalist's core messages:  that homosexuality is explicitly stated as evil in the Bible, and that the Sodom and Gomorrah stories were primarily about homosexuality and ""perversion.""  Critics attest that the rule found in Leviticus that demands capital punishment for those who are homosexual has to be examined contextually, instead of literally.  They go on to argue that many other rules in Leviticus also threaten death for a variety of other rather mundane activities, such as eating shrimp or working on the Sabbath.  Biblical scholars from both sides also debate the current belief in academia that Sodom and Gomorrah were actually destroyed over differences in tribal custom--one being the tradition of inviting strangers into the home, of all things.It is a familiar argument to anyone having difficulties parsing the inherent contradiction in interpreting the Bible literally--you must literally believe everything in the Bible to truly be a literalist.  So why, one may ask, is the Bible being waved around as ""proof"" that homosexuality is evil if it is clear that you cannot base modern behavior on millennia-old dictates?  This film suggests that those who use the Bible in this manner are not intellectually honest, or honorable, folk.FBTMS challenges viewers to answer three questions:  why do you believe, what do you believe, and how did you come to your belief regarding homosexuality?  Through interviews and personal stories, the story told is that homophobia is exactly that:  ""the state of fearing that which is homosexual.""  The filmmakers suggest that this fear is lent religious credence with a few scattered Biblical quotations mixed with earnest sermons from influential ministers.  This is a stunning argument when examined--are religious leaders really just wrapping up a primitive fear in the coating of malleable religious dogma?Other issues explored are the choice/no-choice controversy, ""homosexual rehabilitation,"" and hate crimes.  This movie delivers its message in a scholarly, passionate, subtle, and sublime fashion.  The message is simple.  Love--of parents, of neighbors, of community, and of tolerance--is the answer.  Daniel Karslake directs this masterfully, as too-often an ""informative"" film can quickly deteriorate into preachy, irritating material that is off-message.  This documentary is highly recommended to everyone, especially those willing to see a movie that avoids annoying methods of argumentation while still delivering a powerful message of tolerance.",5,"Karslake asks us to discover what we fear, instead of who we hate",1227312000,"11 22, 2008",2008,4286,"['Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'FBTMS', 'director', 'Daniel', 'Karslake', 'interesting', 'movie', 'many', 'levels', 'Most', 'superficially', 'documentary', 'illustrating', 'how', 'many', 'religious', 'leaders', 'have', 'held', 'aloft', 'homosexuality', 'convenient', 'demon', 'influence', 'flock', 'candid', 'interviews', 'several', 'individuals', 'parents', 'movie', 'personal', 'evolution', 'families', 'are', 'coming', 'gripes', 'realization', 'child', 'not', 'straight', 'More', 'fascinating', 'three', 'families', 'contain', 'parents', 'and/or', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'practicing', 'pastors', 'ministers.Gene', 'Robinson', 'ignited', 'waves', 'controversy', 'discussion', 'hatred', 'when', 'was', 'elected', 'bishop', 'Anglican', 'Church', '2004', 'issue', 'was', 'Bishop', 'Gene', 'Robinson', 'was', 'openly', 'gay', 'non-celibate', 'priest', 'several', 'interviews', 'parents', 'have', 'glimpse', 'spiritual', 'torture', 'man', 'who', 'inner', 'torment', 'failed', 'marriage', 'parents', 'finally', 'faith', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'share', 'ultimate', 'vindication', 'end', 'film', 'ushered', 'bishop', 'not', 'cries', 'rage', 'cheers', 'joy.Chrissy', 'Gephardt', 'daughter', 'yesteryear', 'presidential', 'hopeful', 'Richard', 'Gephardt', 'viewer', 'struggle', 'sexuality', 'Chrissy', 'also', 'anguish', 'loving', 'passionless', 'marriage', 'Ultimately', 'parents', 'gay', 'far', 'rejecting', 'embrace', 'daughter', 'offer', 'place', 'presidential-election', 'campaign', 'staff', 'own', 'words', 'felt', 'acceptance', 'anything', 'had', 'expected', 'campaign.Delving', 'deeper', 'movie', 'viewer', 'presented', 'arguments', 'attack', 'two', 'fundamentalist', 'core', 'messages', 'homosexuality', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'evil', 'Bible', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'stories', 'were', 'primarily', 'homosexuality', 'perversion', 'Critics', 'attest', 'rule', 'found', 'Leviticus', 'capital', 'punishment', 'who', 'are', 'homosexual', 'be', 'examined', 'contextually', 'instead', 'literally', 'go', 'argue', 'many', 'other', 'rules', 'Leviticus', 'also', 'threaten', 'death', 'variety', 'other', 'rather', 'mundane', 'activities', 'such', 'eating', 'shrimp', 'working', 'Sabbath', 'Biblical', 'scholars', 'sides', 'also', 'debate', 'current', 'belief', 'academia', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'were', 'actually', 'destroyed', 'over', 'differences', 'tribal', 'custom', 'one', 'being', 'tradition', 'inviting', 'strangers', 'home', 'things.It', 'familiar', 'argument', 'anyone', 'having', 'difficulties', 'parsing', 'inherent', 'contradiction', 'interpreting', 'Bible', 'literally', 'must', 'literally', 'believe', 'everything', 'Bible', 'truly', 'be', 'literalist', 'So', 'why', 'one', 'may', 'ask', 'Bible', 'being', 'waved', 'proof', 'homosexuality', 'evil', 'clear', 'can', 'not', 'base', 'modern', 'behavior', 'millennia-old', 'dictates', 'film', 'who', 'use', 'Bible', 'manner', 'are', 'not', 'intellectually', 'honest', 'honorable', 'folk.FBTMS', 'viewers', 'answer', 'three', 'questions', 'why', 'do', 'believe', 'what', 'do', 'believe', 'how', 'did', 'come', 'belief', 'regarding', 'homosexuality', 'interviews', 'personal', 'stories', 'story', 'told', 'homophobia', 'exactly', 'state', 'fearing', 'homosexual', 'filmmakers', 'suggest', 'fear', 'lent', 'religious', 'credence', 'few', 'scattered', 'Biblical', 'quotations', 'mixed', 'earnest', 'sermons', 'influential', 'ministers', 'stunning', 'argument', 'when', 'examined', 'are', 'religious', 'leaders', 'really', 'just', 'wrapping', 'up', 'primitive', 'fear', 'coating', 'malleable', 'religious', 'dogma', 'Other', 'issues', 'explored', 'are', 'choice/no-choice', 'controversy', 'homosexual', 'rehabilitation', 'hate', 'crimes', 'movie', 'message', 'scholarly', 'passionate', 'subtle', 'sublime', 'fashion', 'message', 'simple', 'Love', 'parents', 'neighbors', 'community', 'tolerance', 'answer', 'Daniel', 'Karslake', 'masterfully', 'too-often', 'informative', 'film', 'can', 'quickly', 'deteriorate', 'preachy', 'irritating', 'material', 'off-message', 'documentary', 'highly', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'especially', 'willing', 'see', 'movie', 'annoying', 'methods', 'argumentation', 'still', 'delivering', 'powerful', 'message', 'tolerance']",For The Bible Tells Me So

1119899,A12IRGQLFE4EBA,B000YHQNCI,,"[4, 8]","I was recently looking for a good documentary about religion and social issues to watch and kind of just stumbled upon this one.  I did not realize until 20 minutes into it (lol) that the film deals only with the LGBT community and their parents as it relates to Christianity .  I was very moved and would highly recommend For The Bible Tells Me So to anyone who believes religious text justifies non acceptance and/or discrimination towards the LGBT community.For The Bible Tells Me So is a documentary which chronicles the plight (and ultimate acceptance) of a handful of baby boomer parents and older of gay and/or lesbian children who initially had negative feelings about their children's sexual orientation due to biblical scripture.  The documentary also references religious scholars who interpret the Bible from both a historically academic point of view (the whole ""time and place"" theory of words and their context during biblical times) as well as a personal religious one often stating that the Bible is a nuanced text that holds different meanings for different readers.  The format of For The Bible Tells Me So shows parents of gay and/or lesbian adult children discussing how deeply steeped in their church communities they are and how sad, angry and confused they were over what they believed the Bible and their church community taught about homosexuality.  Most of the families chronicled seemed more sad and confused but at least tried to understand their children, however one mother was so unaccepting that her daughter wound up committing suicide (it may have not been the only reason, but it probably was part of it).  Ultimately, all of the parents in the film wound up becoming social activists on behalf of the LGBT community even going so far as to march in unity to the headquarters of Focus On The Family to deliver a letter to its founder who literally instructs parents of gay/lesbian children not to accept them so they will ""turn away"" from their ""choice.""During a time when gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered youth suicide is becoming alarmingly common, it would be helpful for parents of these children (especially the more religious and conservative ones) to take a deep breath, do some reading outside of the church and watch this documentary (I'm sure there are also many others that discuss the same topic that are well rounded) before they make an often stressful and confusing time more stressful and confusing.  :-(Well done.",5,Moving Documentary - Good Information,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,2468,"['was', 'recently', 'looking', 'good', 'documentary', 'religion', 'social', 'issues', 'watch', 'kind', 'just', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'one', 'did', 'not', 'realize', '20', 'minutes', 'lol', 'film', 'deals', 'only', 'LGBT', 'community', 'parents', 'Christianity', 'was', 'very', 'moved', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'anyone', 'who', 'religious', 'text', 'justifies', 'non', 'acceptance', 'and/or', 'discrimination', 'LGBT', 'community.For', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'documentary', 'plight', 'ultimate', 'acceptance', 'handful', 'baby', 'boomer', 'parents', 'older', 'gay', 'and/or', 'lesbian', 'children', 'who', 'initially', 'had', 'negative', 'feelings', 'children', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'due', 'biblical', 'scripture', 'documentary', 'also', 'religious', 'scholars', 'who', 'interpret', 'Bible', 'historically', 'academic', 'point', 'view', 'whole', 'time', 'place', 'theory', 'words', 'context', 'biblical', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'religious', 'one', 'often', 'stating', 'Bible', 'nuanced', 'text', 'different', 'meanings', 'different', 'readers', 'format', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'parents', 'gay', 'and/or', 'lesbian', 'adult', 'children', 'discussing', 'how', 'deeply', 'steeped', 'church', 'communities', 'are', 'how', 'sad', 'angry', 'confused', 'were', 'over', 'what', 'believed', 'Bible', 'church', 'community', 'taught', 'homosexuality', 'Most', 'families', 'chronicled', 'seemed', 'more', 'sad', 'confused', 'least', 'tried', 'understand', 'children', 'however', 'one', 'mother', 'was', 'so', 'unaccepting', 'daughter', 'wound', 'up', 'committing', 'suicide', 'may', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'only', 'reason', 'probably', 'was', 'part', 'Ultimately', 'parents', 'film', 'wound', 'up', 'becoming', 'social', 'activists', 'behalf', 'LGBT', 'community', 'even', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'march', 'unity', 'headquarters', 'Focus', 'Family', 'deliver', 'letter', 'founder', 'who', 'literally', 'parents', 'gay/lesbian', 'children', 'not', 'accept', 'so', 'will', 'turn', 'away', 'choice', 'time', 'when', 'gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgendered', 'youth', 'suicide', 'becoming', 'alarmingly', 'common', 'would', 'be', 'helpful', 'parents', 'children', 'especially', 'more', 'religious', 'conservative', 'ones', 'take', 'deep', 'breath', 'do', 'reading', 'church', 'watch', 'documentary', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'also', 'many', 'others', 'discuss', 'same', 'topic', 'are', 'well', 'rounded', 'make', 'often', 'stressful', 'confusing', 'time', 'more', 'stressful', 'confusing', 'Well', 'done']",For The Bible Tells Me So

Organized religion, by its nature, hates dissent, and will do anything to destroy it. This movie confirms that organized religion, and whatever holy books they use to promote their evil, are the most destructive forces on Earth. So what happens when people question what their religion has taught them about homosexuality? Other organized religions attack them, just as they have for centuries; they seek to demonize them, legislate against them, and even kill them. Yes, folks, this is the true face of religion. It is given credence by the simple-minded notion that there is someone who lives in the sky and watches everything we do. That not only appeals to humanity's bizarre fascination with super heros with magical powers, but it always plays to humanity's fear of death. One can live forever in paradise if they follow the right religion. Well, isn't that the greatest con job of all time!

1119903,A12X2J7AVZ04IQ,B000YHQNCI,,"[5, 7]","OK, maybe a little one-sided, but there's certainly a lot to be said about the brain-washing of the church-going society at large. Religion (or a form of it) has been responsible for most of the wars of the world, as well as some of the more abhorrant incidents in history (Inquisition, Holocaust, etc.) The Christian Right is hateful and mean-spirited; kids spew venom against gays that could've only been learned in the church or at home. I applaud this film for making an attempt to explain that the Bible has always been misinterpreted, and our church-going populace has been taught to hate. To hear young people spew hatred is especially unsettling. A subject this huge cannot be sufficiently argued in a 2 hour film, so it's a little one-sided, pro-gay. What bothers me the most is how wrong those fundamentalists can be about Jesus' initial message: Love one another and try to get along. The Bible was written by men who thought the earth was flat. We've come a long way, baby, and it's time to realize that God gave every individual a brain, capable of thinking, to reach out and discover mysteries that we may not have pondered. Life goes on. Dick Gephardt and his daughter were a fine example of what this film tried to get across. Also, the inclusion of people of color. The suicide of the daughter whose parents simply refused to understand. (No mention of Dick Cheney and his gay daughter). Fact is, all people are different, and in so VERY many different ways. Accepting these differences is what makes life exciting; to be stuck in a rut of thought, like that Christian Right, denies one the ability to live life at its fullest.

1119904,A56AA52NMMKYQ,B000YHQNCI,,"[5, 8]","""For the Bible Tells Me So"" is a documentary purporting to refute those who claim the Bible condemns homosexuality.  Thought provoking and compassionate toward those who are gay and who are suffering oppression because of it, the film left me conflicted.On the one hand, I do feel compassion for the pain that gays experience because of their orientation, compassion for the families who have lost loved ones to suicide or who have broken relationships.  On the other hand, I feel the movie demonizes the church by painting it with a ovrly broad brush that is more appropriately reserved to one fundamentalist, literalistic slice.Put differently, it is no more accurate to see The Church as a monolithic entity than it is to put The Gays into one stereotypical bucket.  The truth is that many strands of the church are struggling - albeit unsuccessfully - with inclusion of gays and acceptance of them.  The fact that the Episcopal Church ordained a gay Bishop illustrates the progress made but also the distance left to travel.Further, there is no denying that - in both the Old and New Testaments - the Bible has something to say about homosexuality, and that something is consistently condemnatory.  There are ""contextual"" attempts to dilute the ""abomination"" label or to explain away the condemnation.  Whether you find these explanations compelling may depend on what side of the divide you stand on.  Further, the efforts at being confrontational and demonizing the likes of James Dobson risks putting gays into the same oppression mode as their purported fundamentalist enemies.  In such a way, the gay movement threatens to become a mirror image of that which it purports to hate.Again, this is a thought-provoking documentary with a clear point of view ion the issue.  It hopefully can lead to constructive - not confrontational - dialogue between Christians and gays, not as mutually exclusive factions but as overlapping groups.",4,Thought-provoking though clearly slanted ....,1214006400,"06 21, 2008",2008,1939,"['Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'documentary', 'purporting', 'refute', 'who', 'claim', 'Bible', 'condemns', 'homosexuality', 'Thought', 'provoking', 'compassionate', 'who', 'are', 'gay', 'who', 'are', 'suffering', 'oppression', 'film', 'left', 'conflicted.On', 'one', 'hand', 'do', 'feel', 'compassion', 'pain', 'experience', 'orientation', 'compassion', 'families', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'loved', 'ones', 'suicide', 'who', 'have', 'broken', 'relationships', 'other', 'hand', 'feel', 'movie', 'church', 'painting', 'ovrly', 'broad', 'brush', 'more', 'appropriately', 'reserved', 'one', 'fundamentalist', 'literalistic', 'slice.Put', 'differently', 'more', 'accurate', 'see', 'Church', 'monolithic', 'entity', 'put', 'Gays', 'one', 'stereotypical', 'bucket', 'truth', 'many', 'strands', 'church', 'are', 'struggling', 'albeit', 'unsuccessfully', 'inclusion', 'gays', 'acceptance', 'fact', 'Episcopal', 'Church', 'ordained', 'gay', 'Bishop', 'progress', 'made', 'also', 'distance', 'left', 'travel.Further', 'denying', 'Old', 'New', 'Testaments', 'Bible', 'something', 'say', 'homosexuality', 'something', 'consistently', 'condemnatory', 'are', 'contextual', 'attempts', 'dilute', 'abomination', 'label', 'explain', 'away', 'condemnation', 'find', 'explanations', 'compelling', 'may', 'depend', 'what', 'side', 'divide', 'stand', 'Further', 'efforts', 'being', 'confrontational', 'demonizing', 'likes', 'James', 'Dobson', 'risks', 'putting', 'gays', 'same', 'oppression', 'mode', 'purported', 'fundamentalist', 'enemies', 'such', 'way', 'gay', 'movement', 'become', 'mirror', 'image', 'hate.Again', 'thought-provoking', 'documentary', 'clear', 'point', 'view', 'ion', 'issue', 'hopefully', 'can', 'lead', 'constructive', 'not', 'confrontational', 'dialogue', 'Christians', 'gays', 'not', 'mutually', 'exclusive', 'factions', 'overlapping', 'groups']",For The Bible Tells Me So

It doesn't start out that way, with all this anti-homosexual rhetoric, especially by fundamentalist preachers. But we meet the families of gay men and women, the gay and lesbians they have come to understand and accept, and the ways in which they have helped bring LGBT rights to the forefront of public awareness.Take Gene Robinson, for example, the first openly gay Episcopalian bishop (New Hampshire), and indeed the first in the entire Anglican communion. His parents and his ex-wife are included in the movie, talking at length about how they came to accept that he was gay. And ultimately, how they were supportive of his election to Bishop even in the face of death threats (he wore a bullet-proof vest under his cassock at the ritual) and an army of reporters and cameras.Chrissy Gephardt, lesbian daughter of Dick Gephardt, talking about her life and how it impacted and was impacted by her father's run for the presidential nomination.Rondi and Phil Reitan had a charming young son. They were plenty shook up when he told them he was gay, and decided they had to become informed about the facts of homosexuality. What they learned was so very different from what James Dobson had told them on ""Focus on the Family"" that they decided to take the fight for gay rights to him. They wrote a letter which they read to the crowd, and the police told them that if they crossed onto Dobson's property, they would be arrested. Mrs. Reitan decided she had to deliver the letter, and she and her husband and her son were indeed arrested. Do you think Dobson got the message?Brenda and David Poteet, very conservative black Christians, also appear in the film and talk frankly about their lesbian daughter. They will go only so far and no further in accepting her ""lifestyle,"" as David puts it, but they love their daughter and they accept her for who she is.There is a good bit of discussion about the people who claim homosexuality is a choice, that they can be ""cured,"" and that parents should take that approach. This viewpoint is quite thoroughly discredited, including some interesting current scientific evidence that birth order is one of the important causes for gay males especially. It seems a mother's body treats the maleness of a fetus as an alien invasion. The more often she has boys, the more her body adapts by feminizing the fetus. Statistically, gay men are more likely to have several older brothers.The saddest story is a woman whose Lesbian daughter had a hard time with her mother, and eventually committed suicide. After her daughter died, the mother studied the truth about lesbianism and finally became an outspoken advocate for gay rights. She felt her daughter had not died in vain, because she learned to love her and effectively ""make restitution"" for her coldness to her daughter.This is a very intense movie, and includes quite a few religious leaders, both for and against, who speak their minds about the passages in the Bible that are used to condemn gays.

Davis ""Just a guy.""","[7, 8]","As a young man who regularly attended church and took an active part in the youth ministry, I was really disturbed when I began to suspect I might be gay. Everyone told us that homosexuality was never God's plan, and I had to silently deal with these strange feelings that I felt must be sinful.Finally, early this month, I came to terms with it: I'm gay and I didn't know what that meant about my faith. My family was fortunately very understanding, and my sister's husband suggested I check out this documentary, especially after a respected church member sent me some rather disturbing and condemning messages.I watched it alone, and it was really difficult to sit through in many places. I feel the producers were quite varied in their responses and selection of footage: we had the radical Bible-thumping Christians, while also looking at five Christian families who had gay children.In the stories, I felt I met kindred spirits in them. A lot of their thoughts and fears mirrored my own, so it was wonderful to know that I was not alone in these feelings and wondering if being a gay Christian was even possible.However, a downside to the even-handedness is that I didn't feel the question was answered clearly. Many interpretations of the Bible's few references to homosexuality are presented, no one interpretation being favored. Overall, I got the message that a passionate love for someone of your own gender is not evil, but the question of intimacy was certainly left ambiguous.So, while it did help answer some of my questions and let me know I am not alone, I think I'll have to look elsewhere for more answers.

1119911,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B000YHQNCI,K. Driscoll,"[7, 8]","For the Bible Tells Me So is a documentary that provides an overview of the debate regarding homosexuality and how it is not approved within the pages of the bible.  Sure, religion has been used as an excuse to segregate, murder, and enslave whole groups of people for centuries but at least up until the last one hundred years or so; those Christian knew their bible verses quite well.  They honored their rigid canon and seemed to know their own propaganda a bit more than today's multitude of illiterate bible thumpers and religious politicians.  I always wondered why the nice Christians out there weren't a little bit more upset over this.Anyway, For the Bible Tells Me So makes a very keen observation; politicizing the bible for anti-gay purposes can be equated to politicizing the bible for those of us who are troubled by other abominations.  The film sites other abominations in Leviticus that can probably be equated to homosexuality and some of them are ridiculous.  Unfortunately most of the sheep in this culture probably only associate the term abomination with theIncredible Hulk's arch-nemesis.  So really, almost anything can be denounced by the bible for political purposes.  Now, as a human being, my knee jerk reaction to the fact that the bible indicates we should execute homosexuals isn't whether or not we should follow the word of god here but instead, whether or not we should consider some elements of the bible not only obsolete but offensive to the peace of humanity, so take that for what it is.  I really appreciated the film's interviews with bible scholars who do find massive value in the book everyday but do not agree with the ideas this film attacks regarding homosexuality.  For the Bible Tells Me So does not fiercely attack religion per se, and for that it gains even more credibility in my eyes. Instead, the movie pushes an agenda of its own and asks that Christianity actually accept homosexuality by demonstrating the few denominations that already have, among other points.  At least that is kind of what I got out of it.  It is a fascinating topic and it turns out to be a really fascinating perspective, but overall, the way the bible is politicized is unfair to both homosexuals and to many Christians.There are some really powerful stories about real people here and I think that is why I found this film so compelling.  I don't like to let my opinion slip out too often, especially when we are just talking about a movie here, but I am absolutely convinced that homosexuality is not a choice.  Let's assume that's true for a minute and consider the suicide rate of homosexuals.  I'm convinced something is wrong here and films like this might help us work toward understanding each other more.  It is not a flawless message but For the Bible Tells Me So does have some hugely important things to say.",4,Compelling Documentary that I Wish More People Would See,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",2009,2851,"['Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'documentary', 'overview', 'debate', 'regarding', 'homosexuality', 'how', 'not', 'approved', 'pages', 'bible', 'Sure', 'religion', 'been', 'used', 'excuse', 'segregate', 'murder', 'enslave', 'whole', 'groups', 'people', 'centuries', 'least', 'up', 'last', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'so', 'Christian', 'knew', 'bible', 'verses', 'quite', 'well', 'honored', 'rigid', 'canon', 'seemed', 'know', 'own', 'propaganda', 'bit', 'more', 'today', 'multitude', 'illiterate', 'bible', 'thumpers', 'religious', 'politicians', 'always', 'wondered', 'why', 'nice', 'Christians', 'there', 'were', ""n't"", 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'upset', 'this.Anyway', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'very', 'keen', 'observation', 'politicizing', 'bible', 'anti-gay', 'purposes', 'can', 'be', 'equated', 'politicizing', 'bible', 'who', 'are', 'troubled', 'other', 'abominations', 'film', 'other', 'abominations', 'Leviticus', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'equated', 'homosexuality', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'sheep', 'culture', 'probably', 'only', 'associate', 'term', 'abomination', 'theIncredible', 'Hulk', 'arch-nemesis', 'So', 'really', 'almost', 'anything', 'can', 'be', 'denounced', 'bible', 'political', 'purposes', 'Now', 'human', 'being', 'knee', 'jerk', 'reaction', 'fact', 'bible', 'should', 'execute', 'homosexuals', ""n't"", 'not', 'should', 'follow', 'word', 'god', 'here', 'instead', 'not', 'should', 'consider', 'elements', 'bible', 'not', 'only', 'obsolete', 'offensive', 'peace', 'humanity', 'so', 'take', 'what', 'really', 'appreciated', 'film', 'interviews', 'bible', 'scholars', 'who', 'do', 'find', 'massive', 'value', 'book', 'everyday', 'do', 'not', 'agree', 'ideas', 'film', 'regarding', 'homosexuality', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'not', 'fiercely', 'attack', 'religion', 'se', 'gains', 'even', 'more', 'credibility', 'eyes', 'Instead', 'movie', 'agenda', 'own', 'Christianity', 'actually', 'accept', 'homosexuality', 'demonstrating', 'few', 'denominations', 'already', 'have', 'other', 'points', 'least', 'kind', 'what', 'got', 'fascinating', 'topic', 'out', 'be', 'really', 'fascinating', 'perspective', 'overall', 'way', 'bible', 'politicized', 'unfair', 'homosexuals', 'many', 'Christians.There', 'are', 'really', 'powerful', 'stories', 'real', 'people', 'here', 'think', 'why', 'found', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'let', 'opinion', 'slip', 'too', 'often', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'just', 'talking', 'movie', 'here', 'am', 'absolutely', 'convinced', 'homosexuality', 'not', 'choice', 'Let', 'assume', 'true', 'minute', 'consider', 'suicide', 'rate', 'homosexuals', ""'m"", 'convinced', 'something', 'wrong', 'here', 'films', 'might', 'help', 'work', 'understanding', 'other', 'more', 'not', 'flawless', 'message', 'Bible', 'Tells', 'Me', 'So', 'have', 'hugely', 'important', 'things', 'say']",For The Bible Tells Me So

Enright,"[11, 14]","I share the sentiments of the many other positive reviewers.I just want to mention that it's impossible to measure the damage done to gays and their families by Dobson's media empire and his perverse theology that teaches homophobia.  Not only is it harming people here in the U.S. (including the heart-breaking story of one mother of a lesbian in the movie), but Dobson's anti-gay message is global and creates suffering worldwideDangerous Living - Coming Out in the Developing World.I visited ""Focus on the Family"" once, and was shocked by the literature that was crafted to create fear towards gays.  It was not dissimilar to how Jews were once spoken about, or how immigrants are framed as threats to America (never mind that they pick our food, and take care of our children, and mow our lawns, etc).  Time and again, elites and their media are dividing people, in order to more easily control them.  It's a game as old as empire.  Thankfully, we have DVDs like ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" to counter the divisive preaching of people like Dobson and Rod Parsley (who recently declared that ""we get off on warfare""), and the propaganda of radio hosts like Dennis Prager and Rush Limbaugh.Let's get this film shown in as many classrooms as possible.  If you can, buy extra copies and donate them to second-hand stores, or send some copies to U.S. troops through projects like ""Books for Soldiers.""
