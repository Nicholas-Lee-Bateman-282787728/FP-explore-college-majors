I have been watching it for only a short time and I am currently on the fourth season.The series itself deserves four or five stars. However, the ultra cheap quality of the disks continues. There is little fanfare here. The producers of the DVD series have done their very best to release the disk sets in as an economical manner as possible. The episodes are all on two sided disks - yep, as cheap as it gets!  That said, I have had only one defective disk so far.My DVD collection is rather large, and the material quality of most is quite good. It is unfortunate that these disks are so poorly produced. This is an excellent series.",2,Poor Disk Quality Continues,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,663,"['really', 'program', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'only', 'short', 'time', 'am', 'currently', 'fourth', 'season.The', 'series', 'four', 'five', 'stars', 'However', 'ultra', 'cheap', 'quality', 'disks', 'little', 'fanfare', 'here', 'producers', 'DVD', 'series', 'have', 'done', 'very', 'best', 'release', 'disk', 'sets', 'economical', 'manner', 'possible', 'episodes', 'are', 'two', 'sided', 'disks', 'yep', 'as', 'cheap', 'said', 'have', 'had', 'only', 'one', 'defective', 'disk', 'so', 'far.My', 'DVD', 'collection', 'rather', 'large', 'material', 'quality', 'most', 'quite', 'good', 'unfortunate', 'disks', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'produced', 'excellent', 'series']",N/A
941960,A2B7SS9OH87HLR,B000BGR1AK,Boston Reader,"[0, 0]","This season featured the debut of S. Epatha Merkerson as Lt. Anita Van Buren and Jill Hennessy as ADA Claire Kincaid. The reason for this cast change was forced upon Dick Wolf by NBC, who were threatening to cancel the show unless if he got woman in the main roles. It was sad to see Dann Floreck and Richard Brooks leave the series, but it always nice to see fresh cast members now and then. The new cast do great playing their roles as a female African-American police Lieutenant and a young female prosecutor who is assists Ben Stone. Van Buren is easily accepted by Lennie, but it takes times for Mike to get use to the new boss. Kincaid is more by-the-book when it comes to the law. It's either black or white to her. Also this is Michael Moriarty's last season on the show as EADA Ben Stone. The powerful episodes cover tough topics such race/class conflict, sexual relations at the workplace, accusation of rape against a public icon and a murder involving a celebrity among others. One episode to remember is ""Mayhem,"" which focuses mostly from the police aspect, but mainly because the episode ties in the the SVU/L&O crossover from the '99-00 year ""Entitled."" Also included are deleted scenes, two of which cover Cragen being brought up and another another mentioning Robbinette's departure. Other than season 14, this is the last season of Law & Order in the full frame format meant for older TV sets. But don't let that stop you from getting this essential season part of one of the greatest shows in the history of television. Also Ben Stone was definitely one hell of a prosecutor who was a God fearing family-man and a devout Catholic. But he didn't let that get in the way of his emotionally charged cases. Thank you Michael Moriarty for the handful of seasons paying Ben Stone. One of favorite prosecutors in the franchise.",5,A necessary cast change,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,1840,"['season', 'featured', 'debut', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'Lt.', 'Anita', 'Van', 'Buren', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'ADA', 'Claire', 'Kincaid', 'reason', 'cast', 'change', 'was', 'forced', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'NBC', 'who', 'were', 'threatening', 'cancel', 'show', 'got', 'woman', 'main', 'roles', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'Dann', 'Floreck', 'Richard', 'Brooks', 'leave', 'series', 'always', 'nice', 'see', 'fresh', 'cast', 'members', 'now', 'then', 'new', 'cast', 'do', 'great', 'playing', 'roles', 'female', 'African-American', 'police', 'Lieutenant', 'young', 'female', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'assists', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'Van', 'Buren', 'easily', 'accepted', 'Lennie', 'times', 'Mike', 'get', 'use', 'new', 'boss', 'Kincaid', 'more', 'by-the-book', 'when', 'law', 'black', 'white', 'Also', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'last', 'season', 'show', 'EADA', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'cover', 'tough', 'topics', 'such', 'race/class', 'conflict', 'sexual', 'relations', 'workplace', 'accusation', 'rape', 'public', 'icon', 'murder', 'involving', 'celebrity', 'others', 'One', 'episode', 'remember', 'Mayhem', 'mostly', 'police', 'aspect', 'mainly', 'episode', 'ties', 'SVU/L', 'O', 'crossover', ""'99-00"", 'year', 'Entitled', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'two', 'cover', 'Cragen', 'being', 'brought', 'up', 'mentioning', 'Robbinette', 'departure', 'Other', 'season', '14', 'last', 'season', 'Law', 'Order', 'full', 'frame', 'format', 'meant', 'older', 'TV', 'sets', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'stop', 'getting', 'essential', 'season', 'part', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', 'history', 'television', 'Also', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'was', 'definitely', 'one', 'hell', 'prosecutor', 'who', 'was', 'God', 'fearing', 'family-man', 'devout', 'Catholic', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'get', 'way', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'cases', 'Thank', 'Michael', 'Moriarty', 'handful', 'seasons', 'paying', 'Ben', 'Stone', 'One', 'favorite', 'prosecutors', 'franchise']",N/A
941961,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000BGR1AK,calvinnme,"[6, 7]","The fourth year of Law & Order saw the replacement of ADA Paul Robinette and Lieutenant Don Kregan with Jill Hennessy as ADA Claire Kincaid and S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita Van Buren. Both did an excellent job in their respective roles, and the replacements seem to have been done on the virtue of merit and making a good fit with the rest of the cast versus some of the ""eye candy"" casting decisions that have been made on Law & Order in recent years. The absolute worst of these was the casting of Milena Govich as Detective Nina Cassady to replace Dennis Farina in season 17, a slot that has been reserved for the ""old cop"" half of the old cop/young cop dynamic since the show's beginning in 1990. Don't get me started. At any rate, the chemistry between all of the cast in the fourth year clicked wonderfully, making this one of the golden years of Law & Order. Not only that, it seems the writing made a real uptick in quality.""Profile"" was one of the best episodes ever, and really gave Michael Moriarty a chance to shine as Ben Stone. After a number of neighborhood residents are murdered, the police follow the investigation to a local man who is murdering people he doesn't feel belong in his neighborhood. James Earl Jones guest stars as a black defense attorney defending a white supremacist. Most notable is the performance of a victim shot by the defendant, who gives a spot-on example of how to testify on the stand: ""I remember the voice of the first white man to tell me he didn't serve my kind. I remember the voice of the doctor who told me I had a healthy baby boy. And I sure as hell remember the voice of the man who took a shotgun and shot me in the back"" - this is his reply when he is asked if he can be sure that the defendant's voice is that of his assailant. The episode also wraps up very poignantly, ending on a note that serendipitously echoes the sentiment that led to the series of murders.A very strange and ironic case was ""Big Bang"" in which a woman is killed when she opens a package sent to her in the mail. The bomb ordinarily may not have been big enough to kill her, but it launched her letter opener into her neck. Logan and Briscoe initially focus their investigation on her ex-husband, a highly regarded nuclear physicist, who seems to have a large motive for wanting her dead: she was purposely making their divorce as difficult and expensive as possible. It turns out that the actual murderer was after the nuclear physicist himself. He was angry at the physicist for taking credit for his work, and not knowing about the divorce, assumed this was still the physicist's place of residence. It was just an unintended benefit for the physicist that his legal and alimony troubles were put to rest by his rival. This episode was directed by Dann Florek, who played Captain Kragen during the first three seasons.""Mayhem"" departed from the traditional formula on Law & Order - one crime from start to finish, with the first half being dedicated to police work and the last half the courtroom. Instead, this is a fast-paced and unusually structured episode in which Briscoe and Logan attempt to solve five consecutive murders which take place all over the city. The saddest of these murders, to me, was murder #5. Scotty, a man resembling Roger Ebert, is picked up and held as a suspect in a murder when he refuses to be clear about where he was that evening. It turns out the man is hiding his true sexual orientation and doesn't want to admit he was visiting a male friend. When this becomes clear to the police, Logan and Briscoe go to the jail to get him released. They are too late - Scotty was stabbed by a fellow inmate wielding a sharpened toothbrush. He's dead, and the fifth and final murder of the evening.The final episode of the season, ""Old Friends"", is Michael Moriarty's last episode as Ben Stone. In it, a truck hits a pedestrian and the investigation reveals the victim's link to a baby-food company in which a new partner has connections to the Russian mob. The victim's original business partner in the baby food company has seen something that definitively connects the hitman to the mobster who is on trial. When she learns the Russian mob is involved, though, she is reluctant to testify. She changes her story at trial, and says she never saw the hitman before. Stone is furious, and threatens her with felony perjury. Eventually, she accepts Stone's promise that he'll get her into witness protection. She testifies, and the mobster is found guilty of orchestrating the murder. Shortly thereafter, the witness is shot dead. Stone blames himself, since he pressured her so much into testifying. Stone tells Schiff he's resigning. They share a moment. Stone's last words to Schiff are ""I'm clear as a bell."" He affectionately puts his hand up around Schiff's ear and then exits. The episode's title refers both to the Russian mob's interconnections, and, of course, to Schiff and Stone.I think besides the chemistry of the cast and the good plots, what I liked most about this particular season is that it seemed less ""ripped from the headlines"" than usual. There were an inordinant amount of truly original stories with odd twists and very good opportunities for the cast to shine.",5,A great cast combines with great stories to create a golden year of

It's listed as the 4th year, but also lists Dennis Farina as the star, and Farina didn't come aboard the series until the 15th year, after Jerry Orbach's departure from the series.The fourth year of Law & Order brought about some major changes to the series, with the departures of Captain Cragen and Paul Robinette from the series, replaced with Lt. Anita Van Buren and Claire Kincaid, bringing the first lead female characters into the series.There were several great episodes in this season, including one of my favorites where the detectives and lawyers were trying to track down a shooter in Buddy Holly glasses. This story was left somewhat unresolved, which led to a 2-part crossover with Special Victims Unit in its first year, and this show's 10th season. That's just one of many great stories from this season that I'm looking forward to having in my collection!The season finale also led to the departure of Michael Moriarty from the series as Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone. The following year, his character was replaced with Sam Waterston as Jack McCoy, who has been on the show ever since.All in all, I am anxious to add this set to my collection, and I hope you'll enjoy it too.

Universal has released later seasons of the series on DVD and have now started releasing earlier seasons on DVD. Law & Order-The Third Year arrived on DVD this past spring.The Fourth Year covered the 1993-1994 season. The season began with a riveting case about a talk show host is embroiled in the mystery of a convicted child molester who is killed on the air with millions of people watching. One must remember that during the year 1993 talk shows were reaching their peak. Jenny Jones, Montel Williams, Rikki Lake, Sally Jesse Raphael, Oprah, Donahue, Rolanda, Maury, and Jerry Springer were all on the air during that time period. So for Law & Order to open it's season with a talk show related episode was very appropriate for the show which is known for story lines ripped out of the headlines.The actors who built the foundation for Law & Order appeared on the show during it's fourth year. Jerry Orbach, Christopher Noth, Steven Hill and Michael Moriarty were all members of the cast. This was also the year that Jill Hennessy and and S. Epatha Merkeson joined the cast.The set includes 22 episodes and 43 deleted and extended scenes. The episodes are on dual discs (meaning some content on one side, more episodes on the other side). Episode descriptions appear on the individual boxes that hold the DVD's. Special guests during the shows fourth year include Robert Klein, James Earl Jones, Jane Kaczmarek, and Allison Janney from The West Wing among others.I will admit though that I did have a problem with the dual disc.

941972,A15OXF84G8JKKB,B000BGR1AK,Justin Bost,"[2, 2]","As two new principal characters are introduced to Law & Order in the first episode: S. Epatha Merkerson as Lieutenant Anita van Buren (replacing Captain Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek) and Jill Hennessey is Ben Stone's new assistant district attorney Claire Kincaid (replacing Paul Robinette, played by Richard Brooks).  One of the minor flaws I found with this season is that the character arcs for the departing cast members is never really fleshed out.  However, if you watch the deleted/extended scenes on the DVD, you see a very brief explanation as to what happened to Cragen and Robinette (under the Discord episode).On that note, you can see what a difference the DVD transfer makes, as the deleted scenes are very grainy, even by VHS standards.  But these deleted/extended scenes are much more substantial than, say, the ones in Season 3.  You do see some material rehashed, but the rest is entirely worth watching.  The audio is excellent, and the sleeve packaging that Universal introduced with Season 3 is very much appreciated.The series as a whole really starts to hit its stride in Season 4.  Merkerson's presence is a wonderful counterbalance to Noth and Orbach.  Jill Hennessey has a certain vulnerability, tempered by her conviction to see justice prevail.  Her performance in ""Censure"" is one of the best in the entire season.  Executive ADA Stone (played by Michael Moriarity) still comes off as a little too self-righteous at times, but he still knows how to conduct a cross examination and twist a suspect's lies into a noose to hang them with.  His best performance has to be in ""American Dream"", where he does battle with an old adversary who nearly ends his career.Some episodes may make you squirm in your seat (such as ""Kids"", ""Sanctuary"", ""Profile"", ""Sweeps"" et al.) but that's one of the strengths of this series.  Law & Order, Season 4 continues in the ""ripped from the headlines"" tradition that made it famous.  Even though this is not my favorite season, it is still a solid 4 star effort and well worth your time and money.  This may be the best season for a Law & Order newbie to begin with as it is a bridge between the old and the new face of the series.

941973,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BGR1AK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[3, 5]","For 16 years and still running the combined police and courtroom drama on television has seized a large number of viewers, as the Simpson's is the only show that has ever been aired for a longer time period.  In 1993, the fourth season began to air its 24 additional well-planned episodes of intelligent drama that follows a crime and its consequences.  Its success seems to rest in its simplistic and realistic idea of following a crime, often of hideous nature, from the act to the punishment.  The combination between authenticity and turning of the legal wheel provides an intriguing concept that has undeniably had enormous success while the show also has gained numerous awards and nominations.The fourth season kick-offs with a controversial crime where a murder is committed on air during a talk show.  This episode has its origin from a neo-nazi brawl at the Geraldo show in 1988, but also shadows the future as similar events took place on the Jenny Jones and Jerry Springer shows.  Nonetheless, Law & Order applies the theme in a thoughtful and meaningful manner, as they try to prosecute the talk show host.  There are also several other intriguing episodes such as American Dream and Sanctuary.  These episodes allow the audience to experience the unearthing of old crimes and the unyielding power of hatred and racism.  Each episode reveals an old idea, but in a new light, which makes this and many other seasons exceptionally fascinating.Several of the characters in the fourth season are no longer with the show, as many have left the show for various reasons.  Nonetheless, Jill Hennessy, Steven Hill, S. Epatha Merkerson, Chris Noth, and Jerry Orbach remain apt, as each episode continues to offer additional criminal predicaments.  The fourth season had some low mark occurrences, but has always succeeded to return in the next episode.  In addition, the fourth seasons must also be one of the better seasons despite a couple of average episodes.  Much of the continued success rests within the large number of writers and directors that maintain the feel, but allow each episode to have its own style.  In the end, Law & Order - The Fourth Year, offers a solid criminal drama that most television viewers will enjoy.Year after year, since 1990 when Law & Order first aired, the show has been able to bring home numerous Emmy awards. This by itself is a sign of strength, but also the ability of a show to rejuvenate from within and never turn into a dull repetition of poor performances that would allow Law & Order to drift into oblivion.  Thus, in the fourth year Law & Order was merely a baby learning how to walk efficiently, as this season proves to have some of the best episodes and leaves the viewers excited for the fifth season",4,"One of Televisions Best, and It is also one of the Best Seasons...",1134691200,"12 16, 2005",2005,2758,"['16', 'years', 'still', 'running', 'combined', 'police', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'television', 'seized', 'large', 'number', 'viewers', 'Simpson', 'only', 'show', 'ever', 'been', 'aired', 'longer', 'time', 'period', '1993', 'fourth', 'season', 'began', 'air', '24', 'additional', 'well-planned', 'episodes', 'intelligent', 'drama', 'crime', 'consequences', 'success', 'rest', 'simplistic', 'realistic', 'idea', 'following', 'crime', 'often', 'hideous', 'nature', 'act', 'punishment', 'combination', 'authenticity', 'turning', 'legal', 'wheel', 'intriguing', 'concept', 'undeniably', 'had', 'enormous', 'success', 'show', 'also', 'gained', 'numerous', 'awards', 'nominations.The', 'fourth', 'season', 'kick-offs', 'controversial', 'crime', 'where', 'murder', 'committed', 'air', 'talk', 'show', 'episode', 'origin', 'neo-nazi', 'brawl', 'Geraldo', 'show', '1988', 'also', 'future', 'similar', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'Jenny', 'Jones', 'Jerry', 'Springer', 'Nonetheless', 'Law', 'Order', 'theme', 'thoughtful', 'meaningful', 'manner', 'try', 'prosecute', 'talk', 'show', 'host', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'other', 'intriguing', 'episodes', 'such', 'American', 'Dream', 'Sanctuary', 'episodes', 'allow', 'audience', 'experience', 'unearthing', 'old', 'crimes', 'unyielding', 'power', 'hatred', 'racism', 'episode', 'old', 'idea', 'new', 'light', 'many', 'other', 'seasons', 'exceptionally', 'fascinating.Several', 'characters', 'fourth', 'season', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'show', 'many', 'have', 'left', 'show', 'various', 'reasons', 'Nonetheless', 'Jill', 'Hennessy', 'Steven', 'Hill', 'S.', 'Epatha', 'Merkerson', 'Chris', 'Noth', 'Jerry', 'Orbach', 'remain', 'apt', 'episode', 'offer', 'additional', 'criminal', 'predicaments', 'fourth', 'season', 'had', 'low', 'mark', 'occurrences', 'always', 'succeeded', 'return', 'next', 'episode', 'addition', 'fourth', 'seasons', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'one', 'better', 'seasons', 'couple', 'average', 'episodes', 'Much', 'continued', 'success', 'rests', 'large', 'number', 'writers', 'directors', 'maintain', 'feel', 'episode', 'have', 'own', 'style', 'end', 'Law', 'Order', 'Fourth', 'Year', 'solid', 'criminal', 'drama', 'most', 'television', 'viewers', 'will', 'enjoy.Year', 'year', '1990', 'when', 'Law', 'Order', 'first', 'aired', 'show', 'been', 'able', 'bring', 'home', 'numerous', 'Emmy', 'awards', 'sign', 'strength', 'also', 'ability', 'show', 'rejuvenate', 'never', 'turn', 'dull', 'repetition', 'poor', 'performances', 'would', 'allow', 'Law', 'Order', 'drift', 'oblivion', 'Thus', 'fourth', 'year', 'Law', 'Order', 'was', 'merely', 'baby', 'learning', 'how', 'walk', 'efficiently', 'season', 'have', 'best', 'episodes', 'viewers', 'excited', 'fifth', 'season']",N/A

Dan Florek and Richard Brooks were out at the request of NBC, who wanted more females in the cast. Enter S. Epatha Merkerson as Lt. Anita Van Buren, a tough-talking boss who could match snark with the best of them. Also, Jill Hennessy joined the legal side as ADA Claire Kincaid. Fans might have lamented the loss of Brooks and Florek, since their acting and characters were perfectly respectable, but the two new characters were well-written and well-played, so the quality does not suffer with their arrival. However, this would be the final season for Michael Moriarty as DA Ben Stone, who would exit in the season finale, ""Old Friends."" Many fans, myself included, were sad to see Stone go, though Moriarty's performance does seem tired in comparison to previous years.The episodes, as usual, are familiar from real events, but they are compelling none the less. Racist serial killers, opportunistic talk show hosts, deadly cult leaders and racially-charged city riots are the basis for just a few of the gripping episodes. Other fine works include, ""Discord,"" ""Breeder,"" ""Pride and Joy,"" and ""Censure,"" One of the best is, ""American Dream,"" in which Stone matches wits with a smart jailhouse lawyer who tries to overturn his own conviction. Also, the series departs from its usual format in, ""Mayhem,"" when the episode is dominated by the police as they solve a series of crimes in the course of one stressful day.Although this set contains no documentary extras, we are treated to more deleted scenes. Two of them explain the departures of Cragen and Robinette, which is a treat for long-time fans since their character exits went unexplained for years.

Chris Noth continues his quality work from the previous seasons as Logan, and the chemistry between himself and Jerry Orbach is enjoyable.  Also, this season marks the begining of S. Epatha Merkerson's role as Lt. Van Buren, a role she has beel playing for over a decade making her the longest running cast member in the shows history.Although I like ""early"" Law & Order (usually considered the seasons Pre-Waterston), I look forward to the relase of later seasons.If you are a Law & Order fan, pick this one up.
