Occasionally you'll see it on a PBS station or Sci-Fi, but it's rare.  The episodes were just as good as I remembered them being (hadn't seen them in over ten years)!  This was truly one of the &quot;smartest&quot; shows ever to run on television.  My only complaint about Set 1 is that they include as a bonus an episode called &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot; which has AWFUL sound quality.  I had to crank the volume on my tv up and still couldn't really make out the audio.  If it wasn't for that episode, I would've given the DVD five stars instead of four.

558435,A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B00004Y7DZ,"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid""","[1, 1]","Back in 1967, an allegorical television show emerged that has yet to be topped by any other English television series. The show: The Prisoner. Starring Patrick McGoohan, he plays the role of No. 6, a former secret service agent who resigned for unknown reasons and then finds himself knocked unconscious and trapped in a seemingly peaceful place called &quot;the Village.&quot; Each episode features a new No. 2 (with a few exceptions), who watches his every move and strives to find out why he resigned. The only superior is the unseen No. 1, the supposed ruler of the Village. The only other characters that reoccur are The Supervisor (also called Controller), played by Peter Stanwick, and The Butler, played by Angelo Muscat.In &quot;Arrival,&quot; we first get a glimpse of the Village and of The Prisoner's plight. He tries hard to escape, but the Village has a lethal enforcer called &quot;Rover,&quot; which is generally a weather balloon with a mind of its own. There isn't much to analyze in this episode, however there are a few things to analyze that reoccur throughout the show that I will talk about later.In &quot;Free For All,&quot; The Prisoner decides to run for Number 2's position in hopes meeting Number 1.  This is one of my favorites as it portrays a supposedly free democratic election as being filled with corruption and deceit.  HIGHLY recommend watching this.In &quot;Dance of the Dead,&quot; they attempt mind-manipulation on him to find out why he resigned.  In here, they use females (even a female cat) to persuade him to cough up what he knows.  Even the Number 2 featured here is female.The Prisoner's name is never mentioned. Patrick McGoohan probably wanted us to believe that you or me could be he. After all, we're prisoners in the social order, aren't we? Rover could also be compared to government oppression, as we get a glimpse of Rover endangering one of the townspeople out of spite. And why is The Prisoner numbered 6? Why not 5, 55, 100, and so on? McGoohan once said that it's the only number when flipped upside down, it becomes something else... and that's what I believe No. 6 to be. More than just a number. He's a man, and we all strive to become more than just a &quot;unit in society.&quot; It is also been conjectured that 6 means the &quot;sign of the beast,&quot; but it's also been argued that it means &quot;equilibrium&quot; or &quot;great strength.&quot; Whatever the case is, I believe that it's meant to portray that No. 6 is not just any ordinary human being.The show uses the North Portmeiron Hotel of North Wales as its set and the visuals and the beauty of the place is used to great effect. This is truly a great show. The acting is quite good and the writing is top notch. This isn't just a tv show. It's a milestone.I particularly like this fan-preferred order that A&amp;E brought us, but I'll get to that in a later article.

558437,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,B00004Y7DZ,Bob Thompson,"[4, 5]","Dubbed on the packaging as &quot;television's first masterpiece,&quot; it is easy to see how this British television show has influenced  so  much of modern culture. Patrick Mcgoohan himself acknowledges that he starred in the prophetic show to warn people of a future culture consumed &quot;by gadgetry.&quot; The Simpsons just did a parody of &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and rock groups like England's Mansun are frequently siting the show as a huge influence. (Surely Radiohead and Our Lady Peace must love it.)Indeed &quot;The Prisoner's&quot; underlying themes resonate stronger than ever today and this early collection of the first few episodes is a great place to start if you've never seen the show.&quot;The Arrival,&quot; the pilot episode introduces the premise that will be explored so thoroughly in the following 16 episodes.  A man (Patrcik Mcgoohan) working for a secret British government agency suddenly resigns from his post without any explanation. He is abducted mysteriously and taken to an unusual place known only as &quot;the village.&quot; In the village nobody has names, but designation's, Patrick Mcgoohan is number six. It becomes apparent that escape is impossible as the village is surrounded by only sea and mountains. There is also a strange white ball that comes to restore order anytime anyone does something anti-comformist.In this episode the village is established as a place where you must comform to the rules. Nobody has any real identity except for number 2, the interrogator. What do they want from number six? Simply information on why he resigned. Over the coming episodes we learn that Six is an independant, strong minded creature who is capable of resistance. &quot;The Arrival&quot; is an essential episode because it establishes what will follow in later episodes. Nothing of any consequnce really happens except that we begin to learn how the village works. There is also an introduction to many of the villages mannerisms such as the classic &quot;be seeing you&quot; exit.Second episode &quot;Free for All&quot; picks up where episode 1 left off. It is definitley the best episode of the three featured here. In this one number Six runs for number Two's job. He continues his sytematic resistance of the village's ideals and proves himself to be a strong physical man as well as a very clever man. A James Bond for reality, minus the constant sexual innuendos.Episode three, &quot;Dance of the Dead&quot; is actually a bit dissapointing. Ultimately it ends with Six on trial with his life at risk. This episode is also noteworthy for being the first episode with a female number Two. Otherwise a disposable episode.&quot;The Prisoner&quot; proves that it stands the test of time and that it's messages about conformity and technology have just as much meaning now as in the 1960's. Although the the special effects sometimes cannot keep up with the ambitious scope of some of the idea's, the show is still propelled mostly by it's intelligence and clever writing.The second box set is much better than this intoductive one.

558441,A2SN0CRV5EY58V,B00004Y7DZ,Darrin Lanchbury,"[0, 0]","I was too young to watch this series when it first came out, but I was lucky enough to catch a re-run of it on UK TV in the 80's and became instantly hooked.  I even went as far as to actually visit the &quot;Village&quot; in North Wales during a Prisoner convention and I loved every minute (and I still have the t-shirt!).Pat McGoohan plays the part of a British secret agent (John Drake from Danger Man?) who makes the mistake of thinking he can resign.  Returning to his home to pack he is rendered unconcious and wakes up in The Village.  The Village is a self contained community made up of kidnapped agents, scientists, military and government workers from both sides of the iron curtain.  The Village is run by Number Two and his unseen boss &quot;Number One&quot;.  Everyone in the village are allocated numbers to replace their names and subjected to mental torture in order to obtain any secrets they are hiding.  McGoohan's character is allocated the number &quot;six&quot; and Number Two seems intent of finding out why he resigned.  Number Six is unsure which side is running the system and decides to rebel and the series turns into a running battle between the establishment and Number Six as they try to break him while he tries to fight back and escape. While this series is arguably one of the best programmes to ever grace TV, the individual episodes are somewhat hit and miss.  Arrival is by far the best episode on Vol 1 while the other two rank as average.  The additional &quot;feast&quot; of the alternative version of Chimes of Big Ben is honestly of interest only to hardened fans due to it's poor quality - it was never inteneded for broadcast and seems to be a transfer of a proposed &quot;edit&quot; that was dumped in favour of the transmitted version but kept in someone's attic for years. This is probably the weakest volume of the whole collection (if 4 stars can be regarded as weak), but is a must as it contains the first episode which so effectly sets the pace for the following stories. If this story was remade today with no alterations to the script and minimal changes to the sets and costumes then it top the TV ratings all over again.

558442,A24VVTYRN7BBI3,B00004Y7DZ,David H. Downing,"[6, 6]","While I endorse THE PRISONER as one of the truly artistic programs on commercial television, I understand why it makes people angry.  It promises to be a straightforward if offbeat spy thriller, but turns into a surrealistic allegory.  If you feel it would be easier to accept THE PRISONER's rhetorical left turn had it come earlier and/or been better foreshadowed, you might try watching the series in A&amp;E's revised order.  While its primary intent is to present events in the proper sequence, the new order also provides the foreshadowing that makes the final outcome acceptable.Of course, the first episode MUST be ""Arrival,"" which sets up the basic situation.  A British secret agent (series creator Patrick McGoohan) abruptly resigns, is mysteriously rendered unconscious, and awakens in The Village, the location of which is known only to those who run it.  It looks like a vacation resort, but it's definitely a prison camp.  Those who won't volunteer desired information have it extracted from them in the hospital.  Those who try to escape get to meet Rover, a belligerent weather balloon capable of locomotion, and seemingly of independent thought.  Rover deals with fugitives by plastering itself against their faces, rendering them unconscious or dead, depending on its mood.  Citizens of The Village are identified only by numbers, our protagonist being No. 6.  The Village is run by No. 2, who reports to an unseen and unidentified No. 1 -- apparently an unforgiving boss, because No. 2 is always being replaced.  No. 6 is informed that he's there for life, and that his captors want to know why he resigned.  Of course, he doesn't want to tell them, and does want to escape and find out who's in charge.  And therein lies the conflict around which the series is built.The new second and third episodes are ""Free for All,"" originally shown fourth*, and ""Dance of the Dead,"" originally shown eighth*.  To me, these are the weirdest (except for ""Fall Out""), most disturbing, and most depressing episodes, which I suspect is why they were originally postponed.  A&amp;E begins with these episodes because they both call No. 6 a recent arrival  This placement makes sense to me because both episodes show No. 6 trying to get his bearings and learning the hard way about the darker side of Village life.  In fact, ""Dance"" seems more concerned with atmosphere than plot.  But to me, the major advantage of starting with these episodes is that their twisted, nightmarish logic foreshadows the surrealism of THE PRISONER's conclusion.  There's also a piece of dialog in ""Free for All"" that might even foreshadow the identity of No. 1, but I won't include it here because ""that would be telling.""BTW, ""Free for All"" shows No. 6 getting the nonalcoholic liquor spiel that he gives Nadia in ""Chimes of Big Ben,"" which was originally shown second*.  Another thing that struck me about watching ""Free"" before ""Chimes"" was that we see No. 6 getting that whirlpool treatment from Rover before we see it happen to Nadia, so that when No. 6 looks at the unconscious Nadia on the beach in ""Chimes,"" we now see it as a knowing look from someone who's been there.The picture quality of all episodes is far superior to that of MPI's original VHS release.  Especially improved is the scene in ""Free for All"" where we see No. 6 stumble down a corridor bathed in red light.  An inherent problem with VHS is that such red scenes tend to appear grainy.The sound is also superior as far as fidelity goes,, although it's still mono.  I realize you can argue that a movie or television program on DVD should have the same mix in which it was originally presented, and from the standpoint of historical accuracy I agree.  From an aesthetic standpoint, however, I think it depends on how the movie/TV program's creators would have presented it if the capability had existed.  I can't help but wonder whether McGoohan would have used surround sound if he'd had the option.  In any case, I think a few surround effects at strategic moments might have spiced the DVD release up a bit.Even in mono, however, these episodes are enhanced by a good home theater system with a decent subwoofer.  I'm thinking specifically of (a) the marching band sequences in ""Free for All,"" with that booming bass drum, (b) Rover's ""awakening"" and rising from the ocean floor, (c) the automatically opening  doors, (d) the slamming prison door that ends each episode.Regarding the bonus features,  I was mildly disappointed by the ""foreign file cabinet"" footage, used for the opening sequence in non-English versions of the series.  It includes only the cutaways of the ""RESIGNED"" label on the drawer.  I was hoping it would include some part of the opening sequence to provide context.The ""Alternate Chimes of Big Ben"" is part of any definitive PRISONER collection (despite its poor sound quality, which I wish A&amp;E had tried to enhance).  This is a preliminary cut, using different theme music and sound effects, and including a scene in which No. 6 uses a navigational device to try and determine the location of The Village.  However, I think it would have made more sense to package it with the official version.  Alas, the ""Alternate Arrival"" isn't included here or on any of the A&amp;E sets.The ""textless intro"" provides an unobstructed view  of some shots usually covered by opening credits.  The ""textless outro"" didn't do much for me, though, because the cool thing about the closing is the way the credits are fit in with the construction of the bicycle.  The interactive map, I just plain didn't get.  The trivia showed me I really haven't been paying as much attention to detail as I should have.*In both the U.S. and U.K.",5,A new beginning,1074816000,"01 23, 2004",2004,5703,"['endorse', 'PRISONER',

Fresh from a long stretch playing John Drake in the &quot;Secret Agent&quot;/&quot;Danger Man&quot; series, McGoohan wanted to try something else, but play off of his established spy image---and he came up with this ingenious storyline: here he plays another British secret agent (whose true identity is never revealed), who resigns his post, seeking a better life, only to be abducted and taken to a kind of Lewis Carroll-like fantasy kingdom, from which he is told he can never escape---unless he should decide to collaborate fully with his own captors. For only 17 episodes, this series plays out his battle with the mysterious powers-that-be, even as he tries to maintain his own individuality amongst a colony of people, himself included, who are addressed and known only by numerals---his own being Number 6. He battles Number 2, the colony's mayor, in each show, and always tries to answer the question: &quot;Who is Number 1?&quot; This tape contains &quot;Arrival,&quot; the first story, which beautifully sets up the main elements of the series, &quot;Free for All&quot; (written and directed by McGoohan), a savage parody of the so-called democratic process, and &quot;Dance of the Dead,&quot; a social and political satire worthy of Jonathan Swift, but with the trappings of George Orwell and Edgar Allan Poe. This show is absolutely a must-see for any serious fan of either the secret-agent genre, or of that rare creature known as &quot;worthwhile television.&quot; Thirty-odd years later, it appears somewhat dated visually (a &quot;supercomputer&quot; that covers an entire wall of a room is hardly as cutting edge as the desktop PC on which I'm writing this), but its themes are timeless, and its execution superb.",5,Cat and Mouse Games,981417600,"02 6, 2001",2001,2091,"['quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'most', 'unique', 'brilliant', 'frustrating', 'complex', 'captivating', 'popular', 'television', 'drama', 'ever', 'made', 'thanks', 'almost', 'wholly', 'Herculean', 'efforts', 'made', 'creator', 'lead', 'actor', 'frequent', 'writer', 'director', 'executive', 'producer', 'American-born', 'Patrick', 'McGoohan', 'who', 'made', 'series', 'Wales', 'England', 'mid-1960', 'Fresh', 'long', 'stretch', 'playing', 'John', 'Drake', 'quot', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'quot', '/', 'quot', 'Danger', 'Man', 'quot', 'series', 'McGoohan', 'wanted', 'try', 'something', 'else', 'play', 'established', 'spy', 'image', 'came', 'up', 'ingenious', 'storyline', 'here', 'British', 'secret', 'agent', 'true', 'identity', 'never', 'revealed', 'who', 'resigns', 'post', 'seeking', 'better', 'life', 'only', 'be', 'abducted', 'taken', 'kind', 'Lewis', 'Carroll-like', 'fantasy', 'kingdom', 'told', 'can', 'never', 'escape', 'should', 'decide', 'collaborate', 'fully', 'own', 'captors', 'only', '17', 'episodes', 'series', 'out', 'battle', 'mysterious', 'powers-that-be', 'even', 'maintain', 'own', 'individuality', 'amongst', 'colony', 'people', 'included', 'who', 'are', 'addressed', 'known', 'only', 'numerals', '-his', 'own', 'being', 'Number', '6', 'Number', '2', 'colony', 'mayor', 'show', 'always', 'tries', 'answer', 'question', 'quot', 'Who', 'Number', '1', 'quot', 'tape', 'quot', 'Arrival', 'quot', 'first', 'story', 'beautifully', 'up', 'main', 'elements', 'series', 'quot', 'Free', 'All', 'quot', 'written', 'directed', 'McGoohan', 'savage', 'parody', 'so-called', 'democratic', 'process', 'quot', 'Dance', 'Dead', 'quot', 'social', 'political', 'satire', 'worthy', 'Jonathan', 'Swift', 'trappings', 'George', 'Orwell', 'Edgar', 'Allan', 'Poe', 'show', 'absolutely', 'must-see', 'serious', 'fan', 'secret-agent', 'genre', 'rare', 'creature', 'known', 'quot', 'television.', 'quot', 'Thirty-odd', 'years', 'later', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'visually', 'quot', 'supercomputer', 'quot', 'entire', 'wall', 'room', 'hardly', 'cutting', 'edge', 'desktop', 'PC', ""'m"", 'writing', 'themes', 'are', 'timeless', 'execution', 'superb']",N/A

But what do we have here in this first set of The Prisoner?In set 1, we have the classic first episode &quot;Arrival&quot; in which Patrick McGoohan, playing a character known only as Number 6, awakens to find himself in a strange place--almost a vacation resort (known only as The Village) that seems to have everything that its inhabitants desire---except freedom to leave.  I love the opening to each episode with the great music and on &quot;Arrival&quot; we're given an even longer introduction to the show that you won't see again on any of the other episodes.  Why is No. 6 here? Who is in charge? These are questions that he desperately wants answers to and soon learns that he was brought there so that those in charge could find out why he resigned from some sort of government intelligence position. From the beginning, he refuses to play along and this provides the basic backdrop for every episode. His adversary (a different No. 2 in most episodes) must come up with new and persuasive ways to get that information out of him.In the next epsiode, &quot;Free for All&quot;, a village election is being held and many are curious to see if No. 6 is interested in participating.  &quot;Dance of the Dead&quot; involves an eerie masquerade and criminal charges against No. 6.  There are a few neat extras, including an alternate version of &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot;. The standard episode is one of the best of the series but the problem with the alternate version is poor sound and picture quality.

Subsequently, I caught it at various times in my life as it reran, finding more and more in this very enigmatic, weird, witty allegory. Not only was the entire series phenomenal, it has one of the strongest and most memorable finales ever created -- and it ultimately does answer the question, &quot;Who is Number One?&quot;Now, finally, the series is available on DVD, which is the ideal format for it. Not only is the picture quality in this transfer excellent, but you now have the opportunity to pause and study some of the more interesting production details. Why are there no number sevens on the Village information board? Do the Greek letters on that doctor's machinery hide a secret message? Does the first episode really have *two* characters who are number 66?If there's a flaw to the first two sets of DVD's, it's that the extra material is a little on the light side. Sure, set one has the complete alternate version of &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben,&quot; and there are TV teaser commercials (which just demonstrate that the networks had no idea what to make of it), trivia quizzes and production stills -- but where is the audio commentary? Where are the interviews? Where's Patrick McGoohan? Maybe that will come in the final set, and I see that set three does have a behind the scenes interview. On the other hand, the &quot;interactive&quot; map of the Village really isn't, and if you want an excercise in boredom, watch the entire &quot;Foreign File Cabinet&quot; footage on Set One.But... all of that said, this DVD series is a must-have for fans of the show, and a good addition to the collection of any fan of science fiction, mystery, philosophy, history or what have you. &quot;The Prisoner&quot; is absolutely unique in television. The only other thing that ever came even halfway close was &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; nearly twenty years later, but the issues raised in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; are still relevant today, perhaps even moreso with the rise of both technology and PC groupthink.

558449,A3BV9E9XSA4Z73,B00004Y7DZ,Karl,"[3, 3]","Before commenting on the contents of this tape it might be worth pointing out why the TV series is 17 episodes long (a very NON-standard number of episodes).The fact is that McGoohan only made his original pitch to ITC boss Sir Lew Grade for a 7 episode series.  Sir Lew, with an eye on foreign markets, especially the USA, wanted a 26 episode series.  McGoohan tried to meet the 26 episode target, but production and financial over-runs brought the whole endeavour to a halt at 17.This does NOT, by the way, mean that the story is incomplete.  We are actually told, in EVERY episode, who No. 1 is, and for those who understood this barely veiled message, the story line of episode 17 made a perfect, and perfectly sensible finale.So, back to this particular three episode tape.Being the first three episodes (though the series was screened in a slightly different order in the USA) you know you're getting three slices of McGoohan's original vision - with the emphasis on &quot;original&quot;.In brief, the first episode shows how &quot;the man with no name&quot; (a theme also common to Sergio Leone's &quot;Dollar&quot; trilogy - first released over the three years immediately prior to the first UK airing of &quot;The Prisoner&quot;) - in this case appears to resign from some kind of mammoth organisation (judging by their filing system), in a very heated manner.On returning home, the man with no name is gassed, in his own flat, and wakes up in a strange village (actually filmed in the now-famed Portmerion in north west Wales) where everyone is referred to by a number rather than a name.  The Prisoner is No. 6, the erstwhile head of the community is No. 2.  Only the strange, balloon-like guardians have a name: &quot;Rover&quot;.From this point on, until the final episode, the main focus of each episode *appears* to be the desire of No. 2 (and his/her master or masters) to know why No. 6 resigned.  With No. 6 being equally determined NOT to give any explanations.In reality, however, it is the background to this battle of wills which carries the true message of the series.  So to explain anything more of any of the plotlines would merely intrude on your enjoyment.As a matter of interest, note that is NEVER explicitly stated that McGoohan's character was a spy/secret agent before his resignation, only that he holds information in his head that could be of value (To whom? Again we are never told).  Thus the question of whether The Prisoner = John Drake (Danger Man (UK) Secret Agent (USA)) truly is irrelevant, as McGoohan has always maintained.Many people have offered their views on what this series is about, so my closing suggestion may seem a little strange, namely: If you *really* want to know what the series &quot;means&quot;, DON'T try to figure out what the series &quot;means&quot;.Instead, try to walk in The Prisoner's shoes.  Imagine, as you watch each episode, how YOU might feel, think, and react if this was happening to you.Do this through the first 16 episodes and I guarantee that episode 17 will make perfect sense to you, too.",5,What Makes this Series so Great after nearly 40 years?,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",2001,3073,"['commenting', 'contents', 'tape', 'might', 'be', 'worth', 'pointing', 'out', 'why', 'TV', 'series', '17', 'episodes', 'long', 'very', 'NON-standard', 'number', 'episodes', '.The', 'fact', 'McGoohan', 'only', 'made', 'original', 'pitch', 'ITC', 'boss', 'Sir', 'Lew', 'Grade', '7', 'episode', 'series', 'Sir', 'Lew', 'eye', 'foreign', 'markets', 'especially', 'USA', 'wanted', '26', 'episode', 'series', 'McGoohan', 'tried', 'meet', '26', 'episode', 'target', 'production', 'financial', 'over-runs', 'brought', 'whole', 'endeavour', 'halt', '17.This', 'NOT', 'way', 'mean', 'story', 'incomplete', 'are', 'actually', 'told', 'EVERY', 'episode', 'who', 'No', '1', 'who', 'understood', 'barely', 'veiled', 'message', 'story', 'line', 'episode', '17', 'made', 'perfect', 'perfectly', 'sensible', 'finale.So', 'back', 'particular', 'three', 'episode', 'tape.Being', 'first', 'three', 'episodes', 'series', 'was', 'screened', 'slightly', 'different', 'order', 'USA', 'know', ""'re"", 'getting', 'three', 'slices', 'McGoohan', 'original', 'vision', 'emphasis', 'quot', 'original', 'quot', 'brief', 'first', 'episode', 'how', 'quot', 'man', 'name', 'quot', 'theme', 'also', 'common', 'Sergio', 'Leone', 'quot', 'Dollar', 'quot', 'first', 'released', 'three', 'years', 'immediately', 'prior', 'first', 'UK', 'airing', 'quot', 'Prisoner', 'quot', 'case', 'resign', 'kind', 'mammoth', 'organisation', 'judging', 'filing', 'system', 'very', 'heated', 'manner.On', 'returning', 'home', 'man', 'name', 'gassed', 'own', 'flat', 'up', 'strange', 'village', 'actually', 'filmed', 'now-famed', 'Portmerion', 'north', 'west', 'Wales', 'where', 'everyone', 'referred', 'number', 'rather', 'name', 'Prisoner', 'No', '6', 'erstwhile', 'head', 'community', '2', 'Only', 'strange', 'balloon-like', 'guardians', 'have', 'name', 'quot', 'Rover', 'quot', 'point', 'final', 'episode', 'main', 'focus', 'episode', '*appears*', 'be', 'desire', 'No', '2', 'his/her', 'master', 'masters', 'know', 'why', '6', 'resigned', '6', 'being', 'equally', 'determined', 'NOT', 'give', 'explanations.In', 'reality', 'however', 'background', 'battle', 'wills', 'true', 'message', 'series', 'explain', 'anything', 'more', 'plotlines', 'would', 'merely', 'intrude', 'enjoyment.As', 'matter', 'interest', 'note', 'NEVER', 'explicitly', 'stated', 'McGoohan', 'character', 'was', 'spy/secret', 'agent', 'resignation', 'only', 'information', 'head', 'could', 'be', 'value', 'whom', 'Again', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'Thus', 'question', 'Prisoner', '=', 'John', 'Drake', 'Danger', 'Man', 'UK', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'USA', 'truly', 'irrelevant', 'McGoohan', 'always', 'maintained.Many', 'people', 'have', 'offered', 'views', 'what', 'series', 'closing', 'suggestion', 'may', 'seem', 'little', 'strange', 'namely', '*really*', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'series', 'quot', 'quot', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'series', 'quot', 'quot', 'try', 'walk', 'Prisoner', 'shoes', 'Imagine', 'watch', 'episode', 'how', 'YOU', 'might', 'feel', 'think', 'react', 'was', 'happening', 'you.Do', 'first', '16', 'episodes', 'guarantee', 'episode', '17', 'will', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'too']",N/A
558450,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004Y7DZ,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[13, 13]","""The Prisoner"" remains one of the most original television dramas of all time and one of the first cult classics.  Created and produced by actor Patrick McGoohan, the show was seen as a (nudge-nudge, wink-wink) sequel to McGoohan's hit series ""Secret Agent,"" where he played a man named Drake.  In ""The Prisoner,"" McGoohan plays an unnamed high level, top secret agent who resigns from his job.  As he backs his bags a white gas comes through the keyhole of the front door and knocks him out.  He awakes in the Village, a Kafkaesque community in which he apparently imprisoned (actually a resort on Cardigan Ban in North Wales favored by famous writers like George Bernard Shaw, Noel Coward and Bertrand Russell).  The three episodes presented here include the pilot episode, but the order in which episodes of ""The Prisoner"" should be viewed has always been open to debate.  However, what we have here are the second episode to be filmed and the episode that was supposed to be aired second.  ""The Chimes of Big Ben,"" the second episode to air, is found on a different disc.  Feeling confused yet?""Arrival,"" written by George Markstein and David Tomblin, and first aired on September 29, 1967.  Our hero wakes up in the Village and discovers everyone kept there either has certain knowledge or lived a particular lifestyle of interest to the government.  Names are not used here, and our hero is told he is now Number 6.  The rules are explained to him by both Number Two (Guy Doleman) and the New Number Two (George Baker), but it is clear that our hero is not about to play well with others.  In terms of hooking an audience, ""Arrival"" certainly accomplishes its mission.  However, whereas the key to most stories is having the audience wondering what is happening next, with the Prisoner the viewer is never sure if they know what just happened let alone trying to anticipate the future.Down the road in ""Free for All,"" written by Paddy Fitz and directed by McGoohan, which first aired on October 20, 1967, it is election time in the Village.  Number 6 is persuade to stand for the position of the new Number Two (Eric Portman), although by this time it is clear that every episode is going to have a new Number Two.  Of course, our hero is not interested in the position, but rather the opportunity to lead a breakout from the prison.  He really should know better, because even winning a landslide victory is not going to do him any good.  This was actually the second episode filmed, although it aired much later (this is clear to you, right?).There is more fun to be had in ""Dance of the Dead,"" written by Anthony Skene and aired November 17, 1967, which was intended to be the second episode.  It is carnival time in the Village and everybody gets to dress up and have fun.  However, Number 6, who only wears a black tuxedo, is more interested in the dead body that has washed up on shore, seeing it as an opportunity to communicate with the outside world.  This is one of the more tantalizing episodes because it begins with Number 6 drugged and duped into revealing some secrets and ends with him being tried for ""crimes against the community.""  It seems like we might be close to understanding what is really going on, but, of course, that is but another illusion.  Mary Morris plays Number 2 in this episode (Number 2 was in almost all of the episodes, but always played by a different actor.  The only other character to appear in all of the episodes was the Butler, played by Angelo Muscat).You understand, of course, that once you watch these first episodes you will be hooked on the entire series.  ""The Prisoner"" makes ""The X-Files"" look like a bastion of sanity. These brain candy episodes hold up remarkable well as compared to other television fare from the Sixties.",5,The Prisoner (a.k.a.

It introduces No. 6's circumstances and The Village itself.The second episode is ""Free For All"" which is a send-up of politcal elections. We also learn more about The Village.The third episode is ""Dance Of The Dead"" and focuses on the female quotient at work in The Village- and it has a chase scene near the end that's both funny and nightmarish.Frankly, these three episodes were among the seven or eight Mcgoohan had originally intend the series to comprise. And they are stronger offerings than a few of the later episodes, some of which served as filler (exceptional filler, though) to kill time until the finale'.Now, about that alternate ""Chimes Of Big Ben"" also included in the set. I believe that episode fits best in the fifth slot, so I don't know why they'd put the alternate on the first disk in the set...

The next thing he knows he is waking up in his bed. At first it appears that he is in his own room, but one look out the window shows that he is not. He has been kidnapped and taken to a place known only as &quot;the village&quot;. The village is on an island and he is a prisoner there. The people there are all referred to by number, and our hero is number 6.  It seems the people in power, number 2 especially, want to know why our secret agent retired. INFORMATION they yell. And they will have it, by hook or by crook. There is only one problem; Number 6 isn't talking.My Opinion:  I can just barely remember reruns of this show when I was a kid on Sunday mornings. We didn't understand anything that was going on then. Now the show is very interesting. I'm watching them one by one and trying not to read anything that has a spoiler. The first three episodes seem to be pretty much independent of order. I enjoyed these episodes a lot even though where this is all going is no where near clear at this point. Hopefully it will just keep getting better! Be seeing you at the reviews for the second set.DVD Quality:  Full Screen Dolby 2.0 Mono. The is a two disc set containing the first three episodes of the series. Extras include an alternate version of a furture episode called &quot;The Chimes of Big Ben&quot; as well as trailers, trivia, and stills.What You Should Do:  Rent it if you've never seen it. At this point I can't recommend buying all five sets.

It appears to be taken from a low quality print, the print is scratchy, and the color is off.The set does come with some supplimental material on the DVD.  A very challenging quiz, photos, and the trailers for each episode. Overall this was was enjoyable, the quality of the Chimes of Big Ben alternative version was notably less than all others.
