While it's not the best installment ever made, THE CRAWLING HAND still manages to be somewhat entertaining, thanks mostly to some appallingly bad puns and a movie goofy enough to be hilarious on its own.It's something of a clich&eacute; in terrible science fiction movies to have dismembered body parts wandering around on their own.  In this movie, as you may have guessed from the title, it's a hand (actually most of an arm) that has the ability to jump around killing people long after the rest of its body has been blown up.  In addition to strangulation, it may also have the ability to turn mild-mannered, boring teenagers into zombies, though not made clear is whether the arm really has this power, or if this is some sort of side-effect of the Bad-Science Space Radiation.The mocking of the film is done fairly well, but this is an early episode and the gang isn't quite at the mastery of the form they would achieve in later seasons.  There are a few major periods of silence during the movie, and this forces us to pay more attention to the film itself, which is almost never a good thing in MST3k.  On the other hand, there are several great one-liners, and some truly painful puns.  One of my favorite gags from this episode was Joel getting so fed up that he stands up and starts wandering around the theater, making bored ""hurry up"" motions at the screen.  Little jokes like that ultimately make this movie endurable.The DVD also includes the uncut, original version of the film, but there's no reason that you should have to subject yourself to that.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[1, 1]","Ahhhh, the first season of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" -- cheap sets, weird inventions, slightly green silhouettes, and a comic rhythm that hadn't quite settled into place. One good example is ""Mystery Science Theater 3000 - The Crawling Hand,"" an early episode that roundly spoofs a hysterically bad sci-fi movie about... well, a crawling hand.You know the drill: Joel, Dr. Laurence Erhardt and evil Dr. Forrester do a spirited ""invention exchange"" (and Joel actually psychs out his ""two evil overlords""). Then Joel and the robots head into the theater to watch ""The Crawling Hand.""The plot is simple: a moon expedition goes horribly awry, and the people in charge are forced to blow up the rocketship before it can land... apparently because the astronaut has become afflicted with excessive eye makeup. OOH, sinister.However, the explosion flings his arm down to a California beach, and from there it attacks and strangles various townspeople nearby (no, we never find out WHY). It also infects a young man (Peter Breck) who becomes possessed by an extraterrestrial... thingy, and goes on a strangling spree that somehow fails to kill ANYBODY. Least. Effective. Space Threat. Ever.""The Crawling Hand"" is really a deliciously bad old movie, and prime fodder for the Mystery Science Theater guys. You've got stupid ideas (a disembodied HAND THAT KILLS?), scientific impossibilities (space germs that KILL!), really long boring stretches of talking, a low budget (alien possession is depicted as looking like goth-rocker), and a really bad lead actor who either acts like a zombie or a sixth-rate James Dean clone.But it's worth noting that this isn't exactly the best episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""  -- it's funny and has lots of great lines (""That hand. Can't eat, can't sleep, all I do is think about it!""), and it's obvious there was lots of fun being had by the guys.  But it's not quite the BEST stuff these guys turned out. The one-liners aren't as deliciously zingy as their later work, and Josh Weinstein's Tom Servo just... eh, he just isn't quite as funny, and that DEEEEEEEEP voice is offputting.""The Creeping Hand"" is a truly wretched sci-fi flick, and the MST3K guys obviously had lots of fun tap-dancing on its many flaws even though their comic talents hadn't quite flowered yet.",3,A hand that crawls!,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,2309,"['Ahhhh', 'first', 'season', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'cheap', 'sets', 'weird', 'inventions', 'slightly', 'green', 'silhouettes', 'comic', 'rhythm', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'settled', 'place', 'One', 'good', 'example', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'Crawling', 'Hand', 'early', 'episode', 'roundly', 'hysterically', 'bad', 'sci-fi', 'movie', 'well', 'crawling', 'hand.You', 'know', 'drill', 'Joel', 'Dr.', 'Laurence', 'Erhardt', 'evil', 'Dr.', 'Forrester', 'do', 'spirited', 'invention', 'exchange', 'Joel', 'actually', 'out', 'two', 'evil', 'overlords', 'Then', 'Joel', 'robots', 'head', 'theater', 'watch', 'Crawling', 'Hand', 'plot', 'simple', 'moon', 'expedition', 'horribly', 'awry', 'people', 'charge', 'are', 'forced', 'blow', 'up', 'rocketship', 'can', 'land', 'apparently', 'astronaut', 'become', 'afflicted', 'excessive', 'eye', 'makeup', 'OOH', 'sinister.However', 'explosion', 'arm', 'down', 'California', 'beach', 'various', 'townspeople', 'nearby', 'no', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'WHY', 'also', 'young', 'man', 'Peter', 'Breck', 'who', 'possessed', 'extraterrestrial', 'thingy', 'strangling', 'spree', 'somehow', 'kill', 'ANYBODY', 'Least', 'Effective', 'Space', 'Threat', 'Ever', 'Crawling', 'Hand', 'really', 'deliciously', 'bad', 'old', 'movie', 'prime', 'fodder', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'got', 'stupid', 'ideas', 'disembodied', 'HAND', 'THAT', 'KILLS', 'scientific', 'impossibilities', 'space', 'germs', 'KILL', 'really', 'long', 'boring', 'stretches', 'talking', 'low', 'budget', 'alien', 'possession', 'depicted', 'looking', 'goth-rocker', 'really', 'bad', 'lead', 'actor', 'who', 'acts', 'zombie', 'sixth-rate', 'James', 'Dean', 'clone.But', 'worth', 'noting', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'best', 'episode', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000', 'funny', 'lots', 'great', 'lines', 'hand', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'eat', 'ca', ""n't"", 'sleep', 'do', 'think', 'obvious', 'was', 'lots', 'fun', 'being', 'had', 'guys', 'not', 'quite', 'BEST', 'stuff', 'guys', 'turned', 'out', 'one-liners', 'are', ""n't"", 'deliciously', 'later', 'work', 'Josh', 'Weinstein', 'Tom', 'Servo', 'just', 'eh', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'funny', 'DEEEEEEEEP', 'voice', 'offputting', 'Creeping', 'Hand', 'truly', 'wretched', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'MST3K', 'guys', 'obviously', 'had', 'lots', 'fun', 'tap-dancing', 'many', 'flaws', 'even', 'comic', 'talents', 'had', ""n't"", 'quite', 'flowered', 'yet']",N/A

The jokes run a wide range of topics from the absurdity of an animated severed hand to the acting ability of Alan Hale, Jr. Although the humor is not as dense as in some later episodes like Cave Dwellers or Pod People, there is still no shortage of humor tossed at this B grade science fiction/horror film.
