1605482,AT6ETP42P01S1,B00A3TFJ72,D. Grubka,"[8, 10]","This film had a troubled production history, with the original director being replaced and then being shut down due to lack of funding.  From the way the finished product is edited, it seems that some of the principal cast members were not available to come back and complete their performances.  The movie is fast-paced, gruesome, fun and never boring, and just as things are getting really nasty . . . the credits start to roll.  ""Are you ******* kidding me?!"" were my exact words.  Yet and still, this tale of terrorized teens and the infected flesh-hungry staff at a camp for troubled youth is worth checking out.  It's been compared to Cabin Fever but I think it's a lot more enjoyable than that film, even if it appears unfinished.  Fans of Dave Franco will want to check it out, too.",4,Too Bad They Ran Out Of Funding,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,790,"['film', 'had', 'troubled', 'production', 'history', 'original', 'director', 'being', 'replaced', 'then', 'being', 'shut', 'down', 'due', 'lack', 'funding', 'way', 'finished', 'product', 'edited', 'principal', 'cast', 'members', 'were', 'not', 'available', 'come', 'back', 'complete', 'performances', 'movie', 'fast-paced', 'gruesome', 'fun', 'never', 'boring', 'just', 'things', 'are', 'getting', 'really', 'nasty', 'credits', 'start', 'roll', 'Are', 'kidding', 'were', 'exact', 'words', 'still', 'tale', 'terrorized', 'teens', 'infected', 'flesh-hungry', 'staff', 'camp', 'troubled', 'youth', 'checking', 'out', 'been', 'compared', 'Cabin', 'Fever', 'think', 'lot', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'even', 'unfinished', 'Fans', 'Dave', 'Franco', 'will', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'too']",N/A

BAD MEAT is the ridiculous product of such cinematic tomfoolery.  I doubt if a ""finished' film would have been much better---it's really a derivative and mindless movie.

It has alot of the ingredients of a horror/thriller film and is sure to please for the most jaded taste. Has some very cool gross scenes and some very perverse/weird twisted scenes, and off the wall, somewhat hilarious scenes too. A love making scene with the couple dressed in all black leather is sure to be remembered with over the top perversity. there were some continunity problems with one of the actresses... one minute she is running for her life... and the next minute she is gone... never was explained what happened to her. guys would love this film, but don't know if it would be well received by girls though. again a really bizarre perverse film!",5,great film but plenty of questions,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,861,"['Excellent', 'film', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'great', 'cute', 'sexy', 'actresses', 'great', 'summer', 'rehabilitation', 'camp', 'location', 'found', 'little', 'gem', 'be', 'very', 'entertaining', 'plenty', 'twist', 'perverse', 'storylines', 'alot', 'ingredients', 'horror/thriller', 'film', 'sure', 'please', 'most', 'jaded', 'taste', 'very', 'cool', 'gross', 'scenes', 'very', 'perverse/weird', 'twisted', 'scenes', 'wall', 'somewhat', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'too', 'love', 'making', 'scene', 'couple', 'dressed', 'black', 'leather', 'sure', 'be', 'remembered', 'top', 'perversity', 'were', 'continunity', 'problems', 'one', 'actresses', 'one', 'minute', 'running', 'life', 'next', 'minute', 'gone', 'never', 'was', 'explained', 'what', 'happened', 'guys', 'would', 'love', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'received', 'girls', 'though', 'again', 'really', 'bizarre', 'perverse', 'film']",N/A
