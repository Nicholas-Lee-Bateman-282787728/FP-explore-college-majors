Hannah Senesh provides an answer - her indomitable spirit is the answer.I had tears by the end of the film...but some of the salt of my weeping was also the sense of joy in the goodness that still resides in humanity.

1327278,AV5H2I9CHN8YI,B00366E1AU,N. Gregg,"[2, 3]","Perhaps I read the write up on this wrong, but I was expecting more of a movie (like watching the &#34;Diary of Anne Frank&#34; or something - it's not.  It's a recollection of her, told mostly by her mother with some interview clips thrown in of others involved with her and a mixture of actual footage of events of the war, and &#34;faux&#34; footage (reinactment made to look like old footage).It is a surprising story to me in that she became such a huge, honored symbol (for lack of better words).  She was a Jewish girl from a well-to-do family in Budapest, Hungary.  She was a smart girl, well liked by her classmates as they elected her to office in school - however antisemitism had crept in to the school (where Jews had to pay 3x higher admission) and the school reheld the election to have a non-Jew elected. . . . This was the start of her &#34;wake-up call&#34; and her interest in school went downhill and her interest in moving to Palestine grew.  So, she got herself accepted to an agricultural school in Palestine.  hardly what you'd expect a smart and well-off girl to do, but she figured there were enough smart people - Palestine needed more workers.  A little odd, but...In Palestine, she was &#34;safe&#34; from the German war atrocities against the Jews, and as it turned out Budapest was still unoccupied - a final holdout for the Jews, but she saw the writing on the wall and knew she HAD to get her mother out, and anyone else she could -- now.  So she joined a group and trained to parachute into Hungary and they were going to start getting Jews out and strengthening resistance efforts, etc.  They arrived too late. They parachuted in days outside of Budapest and the Germans invaded within a few days of their landing. They were unable to do anything.She got caught before she could help even 1 person..  So in a sense, she didn't accomplish anything and you wonder why she ended up being so famous, so revered. ....  She had key information the Germans wanted and took her punishments instead of turning over the info.  Somehow within the prison where she was being held she became loved and revered, but this didn't really explain why to my satisfaction.  I guess she was a shining example of holding out a flicker of light to those who were desperately seeking one in the darkness of the times.....It was interesting, not at all what I expected... and while she seems to be someone to admire for her strength and courage, she did have an &#34;out&#34; -- she could've saved herself (so this show says) knowing that the city was being liberated and it was only a matter of a few days....  I didn't really understand why she chose to bravely go down at that point.  I think I missed something.  I'm thinking there were MANY people who were the strong flickers of light during those times, in many places --- how SHE in particular became so famous/special for it I still don't know.If you just love every chunk of info about the Jews and WWII and stuff, you might want to see this . . . but for me, it was interesting but I almost feel like I wasted my time on this.

1327281,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B00366E1AU,Z Hayes,"[1, 1]","Hannah Senesh has been described as the Joan of Arc of Israel, a courageous girl who died at the tender age of 22, executed by the Arrow Cross in Hungary during WW II. I had not heard of her until I saw this documentary, and it certainly made an impression on me. This documentary does a credible job of capturing Hannah's life and death and captures the essence of a remarkable young person.Hannah Senesh was born into a well-to-do middle class family in Hungary and had an idyllic childhood with her brother Giora. As young as seven years old, Hannah began composing poems, getting her grandmother to write them down as she dictated them. At thirteen, Hannah began keeping the first of many diaries, expressing her hopes and dreams. By the time Hannah grows into a young woman, anti-Semitism is rampant in Hungary and Hannah begins to see the discrimination against the Jews in Hungary. Giora has gone to France for his studies and in 1938, Hannah writes that she has become a Zionist, and applies to go to Palestine to study at the agricultural school. She gets her wish and though she is reluctant to part from her beloved mother (her father died when Hannah was six years old), she thinks things will turn out for the best.Unfortunately, the Nazis are on the rampage and during the early years of the 1940s, news of Nazi atrocities against the Jews of Europe reach Palestine. Hannah is in torment, fearing for her mother who is still in Hungary. Together with a small group of Palestinian Jews, Hannah goes on a mission to rescue the Jews trapped in Hungary, hoping to save her mother. Sadly, Hannah and many of her team members are arrested and eventually Hannah is executed.The documentary is well-filmed, combining both archival footage featuring photos of Hannah as well as dramatization of events featuring actors. There are also interviews with those who knew Hannah, and interviews with historians such as Michael Berenbaum. As I watched this documentary, I was struck by the similarities between Hannah and Anne Frank. Both girls kept diaries and were possessed of a maturity and insight far beyond their years. Like Anne Frank, Hannah had a hopeful view of mankind, believing that good would prevail in the end. This documentary is highly recommended for those interested in Holocaust history and it also makes an excellent teaching resource.",5,Brilliantly filmed documentary on an extraordinary girl,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",2013,2356,"['Hannah', 'Senesh', 'been', 'described', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Israel', 'courageous', 'girl', 'who', 'died', 'tender', 'age', '22', 'executed', 'Arrow', 'Cross', 'Hungary', 'WW', 'II', 'had', 'not', 'heard', 'saw', 'documentary', 'certainly', 'made', 'impression', 'documentary', 'credible', 'job', 'capturing', 'Hannah', 'life', 'death', 'essence', 'remarkable', 'young', 'person.Hannah', 'Senesh', 'was', 'born', 'well-to-do', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'Hungary', 'had', 'idyllic', 'childhood', 'brother', 'Giora', 'As', 'young', 'seven', 'years', 'old', 'Hannah', 'began', 'composing', 'poems', 'getting', 'grandmother', 'write', 'down', 'dictated', 'thirteen', 'Hannah', 'began', 'keeping', 'first', 'many', 'diaries', 'expressing', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'time', 'Hannah', 'young', 'woman', 'anti-Semitism', 'rampant', 'Hungary', 'Hannah', 'see', 'discrimination', 'Jews', 'Hungary', 'Giora', 'gone', 'France', 'studies', '1938', 'Hannah', 'become', 'Zionist', 'applies', 'go', 'Palestine', 'study', 'agricultural', 'school', 'wish', 'reluctant', 'part', 'beloved', 'mother', 'father', 'died', 'when', 'Hannah', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'old', 'things', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'best.Unfortunately', 'Nazis', 'are', 'rampage', 'early', 'years', '1940s', 'news', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'Jews', 'Europe', 'reach', 'Palestine', 'Hannah', 'torment', 'fearing', 'mother', 'who', 'still', 'Hungary', 'Together', 'small', 'group', 'Palestinian', 'Jews', 'Hannah', 'mission', 'rescue', 'Jews', 'trapped', 'Hungary', 'hoping', 'save', 'mother', 'Sadly', 'Hannah', 'many', 'team', 'members', 'are', 'arrested', 'eventually', 'Hannah', 'executed.The', 'documentary', 'well-filmed', 'combining', 'archival', 'footage', 'featuring', 'photos', 'Hannah', 'as', 'well', 'dramatization', 'events', 'featuring', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'interviews', 'who', 'knew', 'Hannah', 'interviews', 'historians', 'such', 'Michael', 'Berenbaum', 'watched', 'documentary', 'was', 'struck', 'similarities', 'Hannah', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'girls', 'kept', 'diaries', 'were', 'possessed', 'maturity', 'insight', 'far', 'years', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Hannah', 'had', 'hopeful', 'view', 'mankind', 'believing', 'good', 'would', 'prevail', 'end', 'documentary', 'highly', 'recommended', 'interested', 'Holocaust', 'history', 'also', 'excellent', 'teaching', 'resource']",N/A
