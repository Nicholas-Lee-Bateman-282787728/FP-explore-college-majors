1185129,A3L61G6N7AT8N2,B001EAV3R4,"Bartok Kinski ""A casual stroll through the lu...","[1, 1]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Milarepa (2006) is an interesting Tibetan film chronicling segments from the life of a Tibetan yogi, Thopaga / Milarepa, who lived in the 11th century in western Tibet, who was born into a wealthy family but on the death of his father, was robbed of his inheritance by his father's greedy family. His mother complains about suffering throughout the film but to the viewer, she really doesn't have it that bad, it seems like she only longs for more wealth. Hence the universal themes of vengeance and yearning dictate her motives and disposition. She influences her son Thopaga / Milarepa to study sorcery to inflict revenge on his father's greedy family, leaving his female companion, who is quite beautiful.The first half of the film is quite good and simple in nature, familiar conflicts play a vital theme. The landscape is absolutely stunning and the low key, natural realism of the actors is very momentous.The film loses some of its impetus when it delves into silly Computer-generated imagery during the sorcery scenes. These could have been left out altogether, and insinuations, inferences, and basic camera tricks would have sufficed much better to keep it resembling an elementary human drama. The silly Computer-generated imagery knocks the sorcery scenes down to a &#34;sword and sorcery&#34; Hollywood look-alike.I enjoyed it though and it was capable if you are intrigued by foreign films. In all, it is an above average film that imparts a universal common, human leitmotif, that is of human meaning and human predicaments.",4,interesting Tibetan film,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",2014,1579,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Milarepa', '2006', 'interesting', 'Tibetan', 'film', 'chronicling', 'segments', 'life', 'Tibetan', 'yogi', 'Thopaga', '/', 'Milarepa', 'who', 'lived', '11th', 'century', 'western', 'Tibet', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'wealthy', 'family', 'death', 'father', 'was', 'robbed', 'inheritance', 'father', 'greedy', 'family', 'mother', 'suffering', 'film', 'viewer', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'only', 'more', 'wealth', 'Hence', 'universal', 'themes', 'vengeance', 'yearning', 'dictate', 'motives', 'disposition', 'son', 'Thopaga', '/', 'Milarepa', 'study', 'sorcery', 'inflict', 'revenge', 'father', 'greedy', 'family', 'leaving', 'female', 'companion', 'who', 'quite', 'beautiful.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'simple', 'nature', 'familiar', 'conflicts', 'play', 'vital', 'theme', 'landscape', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'low', 'key', 'natural', 'realism', 'actors', 'very', 'momentous.The', 'film', 'impetus', 'when', 'silly', 'Computer-generated', 'imagery', 'sorcery', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'altogether', 'insinuations', 'inferences', 'basic', 'camera', 'tricks', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'much', 'better', 'keep', 'resembling', 'elementary', 'human', 'drama', 'silly', 'Computer-generated', 'imagery', 'sorcery', 'down', '34', 'sword', 'sorcery', '34', 'Hollywood', 'look-alike.I', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'capable', 'are', 'intrigued', 'foreign', 'films', 'above', 'average', 'film', 'universal', 'common', 'human', 'leitmotif', 'human', 'meaning', 'human', 'predicaments']",N/A

As enthralling and far better than expected as this film is, it disappointingly terminates midway through the story. The end of this movie is a logical breaking point, however, a breaking point all the same, leaving you wanting more.That said, there is no reason to give this DVD anything less than 5 stars, because it could not be better than it is. Interestingly, most of the cast and crew are from a Buddhist monastery. You would never know until you read the credits at the end because there is nothing provincial or pedestrian about it. The acting, dialogue, special effects... everything for that matter, comes across as a very professional production.There is considerable Buddhist ""morality"" conveyed as well, which is perfectly handled by the monks who made this film, but not in a heavy-handed way. In fact, one would need a Buddhist background to recognize the point-blank Dharma lessons contained within. This is something that could be viewed and enjoyed by anyone, including non-Buddhists. Finally, there is a most excellent documentary about the historical Milarepa as bonus material. Herein the viewer will get the full picture with regards to who the main character is as well clear and well-explained Buddhist thought on the same.Highly recommended to everyone and of special interest to those with a leaning towards Buddhist thought.+ + + + +SEQUEL UPDATE: The sequel is to be released in late 2009 (although somehow I feel it will be more like 2010).The working title is THE MEETING WITH MAIPA.+ + + + +",5,Excellent beyond measure,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",2009,1629,"['Let', 'start', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'regards', 'film', 'one', 'drawback', 'part', 'one', 'two', 'enthralling', 'far', 'better', 'expected', 'film', 'disappointingly', 'midway', 'story', 'end', 'movie', 'logical', 'breaking', 'point', 'however', 'breaking', 'point', 'same', 'leaving', 'wanting', 'more.That', 'said', 'reason', 'give', 'DVD', 'anything', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'better', 'Interestingly', 'most', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'Buddhist', 'monastery', 'would', 'never', 'know', 'read', 'credits', 'end', 'nothing', 'provincial', 'pedestrian', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'special', 'effects', 'everything', 'matter', 'across', 'very', 'professional', 'production.There', 'considerable', 'Buddhist', 'morality', 'conveyed', 'well', 'perfectly', 'handled', 'monks', 'who', 'made', 'film', 'not', 'heavy-handed', 'way', 'fact', 'one', 'would', 'need', 'Buddhist', 'background', 'recognize', 'point-blank', 'Dharma', 'lessons', 'contained', 'something', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'enjoyed', 'anyone', 'including', 'non-Buddhists', 'Finally', 'most', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'historical', 'Milarepa', 'bonus', 'material', 'Herein', 'viewer', 'will', 'get', 'full', 'picture', 'regards', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'clear', 'well-explained', 'Buddhist', 'thought', 'same.Highly', 'recommended', 'everyone', 'special', 'interest', 'leaning', 'towards', 'Buddhist', 'thought.+', '+', '+', '+', '+SEQUEL', 'UPDATE', 'sequel', 'be', 'released', 'late', '2009', 'somehow', 'feel', 'will', 'be', 'more', '2010', '.The', 'working', 'title', 'MEETING', 'WITH', 'MAIPA.+', '+', '+', '+', '+']",N/A
1185131,A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,B001EAV3R4,Daiho,"[5, 13]","With enough elements for a first rate secular fantasy - a family squabble over inheritance, thievery, murder, revenge, and sorcery -  the story of Buddhist saint Milarepa could have been a great movie.  Unfortunately, it's not.  Not even close.  It is instead a plodding film that suggests little of magic and even less of the spiritual.As presented in broad strokes by first time Bhutanese director Neten Chokling, the story of one of Tibet's greatest saints is reduced to its bare outlines - the evil relatives who usurp Milarepa's inheritance and leave his family in poverty, his mother's dream of revenge, Milarepa's training in the dark arts, his revenge on his relatives, and his eventual turn to Buddhism to alleviate his guilt.Very little of the story is fleshed out.  We don't understand how Milarepa's uncle is able with impunity to confiscate his brother's wealth, nor why his wife continues to live in her brother-in-law's home, even though her family has been reduced to near beggary.  Are there no other family members or villagers to speak on their behalf?  Why is the uncle is so villainous to his sister-in-law and her children?  How is he able to silence an entire village?Milarepa's mother seems like the typical self-effacing Asian woman and the actress who plays her brings such quiet reserve to the part it's hard to believe her turn into the spiteful harpy who drives her son to learn sorcery and threatens to kill herself unless he makes the uncle suffer.We never learn what Milarepa thinks about all this.  He moves around as directed by the other players.  For a character with so little self-motivation, the actor who plays him turns in a surprisingly appropriate performance.  From beginning to end he maintains the same confused and slightly open-mouthed expression.While the story has great mythical qualities, the film is shot in a fairly straightforward manner.  Director Chokling and his director of photography Paul J Warren have in the mountain scenery of India's Himmachal Pradesh a magnificent setting, one that in it's soaring peaks and vast empty landscapes suggests a world rich in the supernatural.  Very little else does.  There are some fairly simple special effects - levitating rocks, running at high speeds, the conjuring of a storm - but no great panning shots, no off-centered camera angles, no filters, fuzzy edges, or high contrast.Besides being a fairly pedestrian take on the legend of Milarepa, the film is also at times something of a disappointment for missed opportunities.  Director Chokling is a Buddhist lama, a person of some scriptural and spiritual authority, who should be using what opportunities he has to again remind the world of the Chinese occupation of Tibet.  With a little finesses and sensitivity, the thieving uncle ruining Milarepa's fatherless family could have been written as the Chinese taking advantage of the leaderless Tibetans.If you know absolutely nothing about Milarepa, this might be an interesting place to start learning something about him.  It's certainly a better film version than the2006 Taiwanese production from director Sonam Rinpoche.  Still, you'd likely learn more from some of the more interesting written accounts, plus you'd get the full story.  The film takes the viewer up only until Milarepa's decision to seek a Buddhist master.  The second part of the story is scheduled for a 2009 sequel.#",2,"Great potential, little return",1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,3398,"['enough', 'elements', 'first', 'rate', 'secular', 'fantasy', 'family', 'squabble', 'inheritance', 'thievery', 'murder', 'revenge', 'sorcery', 'story', 'Buddhist', 'saint', 'Milarepa', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'Not', 'even', 'close', 'instead', 'plodding', 'film', 'little', 'magic', 'even', 'less', 'spiritual.As', 'presented', 'broad', 'strokes', 'first', 'time', 'Bhutanese', 'director', 'Neten', 'Chokling', 'story', 'one', 'Tibet', 'greatest', 'saints', 'reduced', 'bare', 'evil', 'relatives', 'who', 'usurp', 'Milarepa', 'inheritance', 'leave', 'family', 'poverty', 'mother', 'dream', 'revenge', 'Milarepa', 'training', 'dark', 'arts', 'revenge', 'relatives', 'eventual', 'turn', 'Buddhism', 'alleviate', 'guilt.Very', 'little', 'story', 'fleshed', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'Milarepa', 'uncle', 'able', 'impunity', 'confiscate', 'brother', 'wealth', 'why', 'wife', 'live', 'brother-in-law', 'home', 'even', 'family', 'been', 'reduced', 'beggary', 'Are', 'there', 'no', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'villagers', 'speak', 'behalf', 'Why', 'uncle', 'so', 'villainous', 'sister-in-law', 'children', 'How', 'able', 'silence', 'entire', 'village', 'Milarepa', 'mother', 'typical', 'self-effacing', 'Asian', 'woman', 'actress', 'who', 'brings', 'such', 'quiet', 'reserve', 'part', 'hard', 'believe', 'turn', 'spiteful', 'harpy', 'who', 'son', 'learn', 'sorcery', 'kill', 'uncle', 'suffer.We', 'never', 'learn', 'what', 'Milarepa', 'around', 'directed', 'other', 'players', 'character', 'so', 'little', 'self-motivation', 'actor', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'appropriate', 'performance', 'beginning', 'end', 'same', 'confused', 'slightly', 'open-mouthed', 'story', 'great', 'mythical', 'qualities', 'film', 'shot', 'fairly', 'straightforward', 'manner', 'Director', 'Chokling', 'director', 'photography', 'Paul', 'J', 'Warren', 'have', 'mountain', 'scenery', 'India', 'Himmachal', 'Pradesh', 'magnificent', 'setting', 'one', 'soaring', 'peaks', 'vast', 'empty', 'landscapes', 'world', 'rich', 'supernatural', 'Very', 'little', 'else', 'are', 'fairly', 'simple', 'special', 'effects', 'levitating', 'rocks', 'running', 'high', 'speeds', 'conjuring', 'storm', 'great', 'panning', 'shots', 'off-centered', 'camera', 'angles', 'filters', 'fuzzy', 'edges', 'high', 'contrast.Besides', 'being', 'fairly', 'pedestrian', 'take', 'legend', 'Milarepa', 'film', 'also', 'times', 'something', 'disappointment', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'Director', 'Chokling', 'Buddhist', 'lama', 'person', 'scriptural', 'spiritual', 'authority', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'using', 'what', 'again', 'remind', 'world', 'Chinese', 'occupation', 'Tibet', 'little', 'finesses', 'sensitivity', 'thieving', 'uncle', 'ruining', 'Milarepa', 'fatherless', 'family', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'Chinese', 'taking', 'advantage', 'leaderless', 'Tibetans.If', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Milarepa', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'place', 'start', 'learning', 'something', 'certainly', 'better', 'film', 'version', 'the2006', 'Taiwanese', 'production', 'director', 'Sonam', 'Rinpoche', 'Still', ""'d"", 'likely', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'written', 'accounts', ""'d"", 'get', 'full', 'story', 'film', 'viewer', 'only', 'Milarepa', 'decision', 'seek', 'Buddhist', 'master', 'second', 'part', 'story', 'scheduled', '2009', 'sequel.']",N/A
1185132,AN4TJXMH8QVEV,B001EAV3R4,Jerome Ryan,"[17, 17]","Filmed in the Spiti Valley on the Indian-Tibetan border, this award winning film tells the story of the first half of Milarepa's life (1052-1135), whose path to enlightenment began with revenge. A second movie is planned to complete the story.When his well-to-do merchant father died, Milarepa's uncle and aunt took all the family's wealth, suddenly thrusting Milarepa and his mother into poverty. His mother plots revenge by sending Milarepa away to study sorcery. Milarepa comes back to the village and causes a violent lightning storm to kill many people.When the villagers chase him, Milarepa causes large rocks to fall from a ridge blocking their way. As he escapes Milarepa meets an old monk, and learns of Buddha's teachings. Milarepa returns to his sorcery teacher, who advises him to study with Marpa. The film ends with Milarepa seeking Marpa.The landscape is stark and beautiful. The special effects are quite well done - I especially liked the scene where Milarepa gains mastery in sorcery, a bit like a Pink Floyd psychedelic trip from the 60s. My favourite scene was when Milarepa meets an old monk while escaping from the villagers, and sits quietly with old Buddhist paintings all around him on the wall. You can feel that his redemption is at hand.As companions to this movie, I highly recommend reading a book about his life such as The Magnificent Trickster - The Story Of Milarepa by Molly MacGregor, and some of his teachings like in the book Milarepa: Songs On The Spot by Nicole Riggs.",4,"Fascinating story of intrigue, betrayal, and revenge begins the life of famous Tibetan saint Milarepa",1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,1508,"['Filmed', 'Spiti', 'Valley', 'Indian-Tibetan', 'border', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'story', 'first', 'half', 'Milarepa', 'life', '1052-1135', 'path', 'enlightenment', 'began', 'revenge', 'second', 'movie', 'planned', 'complete', 'story.When', 'well-to-do', 'merchant', 'father', 'died', 'Milarepa', 'uncle', 'aunt', 'took', 'family', 'wealth', 'suddenly', 'thrusting', 'Milarepa', 'mother', 'poverty', 'mother', 'plots', 'revenge', 'sending', 'Milarepa', 'away', 'study', 'sorcery', 'Milarepa', 'back', 'village', 'violent', 'lightning', 'storm', 'kill', 'many', 'people.When', 'villagers', 'chase', 'Milarepa', 'large', 'rocks', 'fall', 'ridge', 'blocking', 'way', 'Milarepa', 'old', 'monk', 'learns', 'Buddha', 'teachings', 'Milarepa', 'sorcery', 'teacher', 'who', 'study', 'Marpa', 'film', 'Milarepa', 'seeking', 'Marpa.The', 'landscape', 'stark', 'beautiful', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'quite', 'well', 'done', 'especially', 'liked', 'scene', 'where', 'Milarepa', 'gains', 'mastery', 'sorcery', 'bit', 'Pink', 'Floyd', 'psychedelic', 'trip', '60s', 'favourite', 'scene', 'was', 'when', 'Milarepa', 'old', 'monk', 'escaping', 'villagers', 'quietly', 'old', 'Buddhist', 'wall', 'can', 'feel', 'redemption', 'hand.As', 'companions', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'reading', 'book', 'life', 'such', 'Magnificent', 'Trickster', 'Story', 'Milarepa', 'Molly', 'MacGregor', 'teachings', 'book', 'Milarepa', 'Songs', 'Spot', 'Nicole', 'Riggs']",N/A
