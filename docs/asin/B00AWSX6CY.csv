1618090,A2XDB0H8RKAT6R,B00AWSX6CY,Christopher Rogers,"[9, 9]","On October 10, 2006 Universal released the first season of Simon & Simon on DVD, but due to poor sales they decided not to release any further seasons. But just over two years later on February 10, 2009 Shout Factory bought the rights and released the second season. They quickly began releasing seasons three and four but still the sales were poor and retail stores declined to stock any future releases because of that. At this point the release of any further seasons were up in the air but Shout decided to make season five available exclusivley through their website. After this it was always a question if another season would be released, even after represenitives at Shout had stated that the release of any further seasons would not happen. They eventually did release seasons six and seven and at this point it was a pretty safe bet that they would release the last season, and only a few months after the release of season seven Shout released the eigth and final season.Most of the stories for the eigth season are just average but their are a few memorable episodes, ""Beauty and Deceased"", ""Simon & Simon and Assocaites"" (which is basically a re-write of season four's ""Simon Without Simon""), ""First, Let's Kill All the Lawyers"" and of course the series' finale ""Simon Says Good-Bye"". Scott Murphy, who played Officer Nixon, is replaced with Tom O'Rourke playing Officer Hanrahan and some notable guest stars include Jerry Orbach, Vera Miles (who's character can't seem to get Rick's name right), Leo Rossi, Richard Kline, Kevin McCarthy, Kate McNeil, Marc Singer, John Considine, Lee Purcell, Pamela Susan Shoop, Robert Sacchi, David Paymer, Anthony Newley and Kay Lenz. Why only three stars? I am a big fan of this show but this season for me isn't that memorable (although I do think it's better than season four), as I've said most of the stories are just average and to me the show seems like it has run it's course. Jameson Parker's youthful look from the earlier seasons has by this time been replaced by the appearance of middle-age, not that their's anything wrong with that, but some of the situations the brothers find themselves in just doesn't work like it did when the show first started.If you order this directly from Shout be prepared to pay more for the shipping and handling ($30) than you will for the season itself. No bonus features of course but since I've seen only the syndicated versions of these episodes watching them UNCUT for the first time is a bonus in itself. Thank you Shout Factory for giving Simon & Simon fans the complete series on DVD.Episodes:01. Beauty and Deceased02. Simon & Simon and Associates03. Zen and the Art of the Split Finger Fastball04.

1618099,A26A8T38C2GQD7,B00AWSX6CY,Taheen Lopez,"[3, 4]","It's about time SHOUT released SIMON & SIMON's 1988-89 Season out on DVD, especially since it was the last season throughout its whole 8-year run on CBS.Therefore this is also the season when the short-tempered gonzo private dick Rick(Gerald McRaney)and his often festidious kid brother & fellow private detective A.J.(Jameson Parker)say say goodbye to both the detective business and to their hard-nosed cop buddy Lt. Abigail Marsh(Joan McMurtry)from San Diego P.D. whom often helped out with solving the Simon Bros. cases just like the down-on-his-luck pardoned ex-con turned private investigator Jim Rockford(James Garner)had his crotchety cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD do on the ROCKFORD FILES.Speaking of detective dramas, something else I noticed was this show reminded me quite a bit of the ROCKFORD FILES, because for one thing Rick and AJ's lived an eccentric lifestyle just like Rockford did since Rick lived on a boat in the backyard of A.J.'s house just like Rockford lived alone on a shoe-string budget in a small rustic trailer in a parking lot in Malibu right by the beach and always kept his gun in a cookie jar and had no office instead of having a typical private-eyes office with a leggy secretary.For another; the ROCKFORD FILES was also like a stepping stone for Gerald McRaney since he had 4 guest starring appearances on Rockford before he was even a star since McRaney didn't even become famous until he did SIMON & SIMON which debuted on CBS in the mid Fall of 1981.For another; Mary Carver who played Rick & AJ's sweet, but longtime suffering widowed mother(Cecilia)has also guest starred on the ROCKFORD FILES too in the ""Dirty Money, Black Light"" episode.Therefore you could say that the creation of SIMON & SIMON was also inspired by the ROCKFORD FILES as well as MAGNUM, P.I.Something else I found kind of intriguing about SIMON & SIMON is Rick and AJ didn't have money, they didn't have snazzy clothes most of the time, or the coolest cars, but they had brains just like Rockford had talent.It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1988-1989 Season like*Richard Kline who is best known for his co-starring role as Larry Dallas on THREE'S COMPANY appearing in the ""Beauty & Deceased"" episode*Jerry Orbach in the ""Ain't Gonna Get It From Me Jack"" before his co-starring role on LAW & ORDER*Marc Singer in the ""Love Song of Abigail Marsh"" episode after his co-starring days on the short-lived series V*Alex Cord in ""The Richer They Are, the Harder They Fall"" episode after his co-starring days as the hard-nosed Michael Archangel on AIRWOLF*Leanne Hunley in the ""Play It Again Simon"" episode after her co-starring days on DYNASTY and before her co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES*Vera Miles best known for her Lila Loomis in the movie PSYCHO and PSYCHO 2 appearing in ""The Richer They're, The Harder They Fall"" episode*Catherine MacNeal from KNOTT'S LANDING and DAYS OF OUR LIVES appearing in the ""Simon Says Goodbye"" episode*Rob Estes known as Sgt.
