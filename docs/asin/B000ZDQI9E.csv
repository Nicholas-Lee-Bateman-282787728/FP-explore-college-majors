1121909,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000ZDQI9E,Acute Observer,"[1, 1]","The True Story of Charlie Wilson, 2007 film""This program contains scenes that have been dramatized with special attention given to historical accuracy."" Drama is ordinary life with the dull parts edited out. The biggest operation in CIA history. ""Charlie Did It"". On July 27, 1980 Congressman Charlie Wilson saw ""60 Minutes"" about the Afghan war. He doubled their $5 million appropriation for Afghan rebels. The Soviet Army only intended to stay 5 or 6 months. [Really?] The people of Afghan resisted for their freedom (growing opium poppies). The CIA only supplied weapons that couldn't be traced back to the supplier. Their intent was to use the Afghans as an expendable annoyance. Teenager Charlie Wilson shuttled voters to the polls to defeat a neighbor in East Texas. [In 1945?] After serving in the Navy, he was elected to the state legislature. Then he ran for Congress as a selfless patriot. Elected, he hired ""Charlie's Angels"". Charlie supported the underdog. Charlie could increase appropriations without any vote!The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan generated refugees who fled to Pakistan. [No mention of land reform.] Charlie met Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite with powerful connections. [Oil?] Charlie and others supported the Mujahadeen. The Russian soldiers were barbaric against the Afghan people. Small toys were mined as booby traps. The MI-24 `Hind' helicopter had no opposition. The Afghan leaders wanted better weapons. The CIA didn't want to escalate the war. An operations officer was assigned to Charlie. Support for the Afghans was aimed as payback for the Soviet support for the Vietnamese. In 1983 there was a report on Charlie's drug use. ""Cocaine Charlie."" Charlie went to Egypt, they had warehouses of Soviet-made arms. Could a modern-day belly dancer be as effective as `Mata Hari'? Excitement? Note the differences in culture between Egypt and Pakistan. The Khyber Pass links Pakistan to Afghanistan, it was used by refugees and for arms transportation.Could Charlie escape a criminal investigation? Yes, a Playboy model testified to clear him in an adroit fashion. [Was a deal made?] They needed another Congressman to help with the funding. The film explains how this was engineered. A DUI and hit-and-run wasn't a problem for Charlie. They gave Doc Long special treatment in Paris, and a show in Pakistan. It worked! The CIA became more involved in supplying arms like anti-tank weapons and mines. A terrorist attack on a gas station in Washington? But what if he lost the election? How did he win against the odds? The Afghans needed a weapon against the MI-24 helicopter, a ""flying tank"", like the `Stinger' SAM missile. In 1985 Charlie developed heart problems. [Whiskey?] Then President Reagan chose to overrule everyone's advice and supply `Stingers' to the Afghan rebels. These missiles worked as designed. This changed the war. The new leader Gorbachev set a time limit to win or withdraw' they did the latter.This was followed by the end of the Cold War and great political changes. Charlie Wilson was given an award. Was the 9/11/2001 attack an unforeseen consequence of the rebel triumph in Afghanistan? The Taliban and Al Qaida came to power there. How was the powerful Soviet Army defeated? ""Charlie did it."" But this simple answer overlooks a lot of other events that were going on at the same time. Machiavelli wrote about the politics where an ally is built up to oppose a common enemy. The end of the alliance can lead to diverging interests. The British fought two wars around 1877-1880 to gain control of the opium trade and its profits. Will another country waste men and money to try to conquer Afghanistan? Was there an increase in opium and heroin since 1990?
