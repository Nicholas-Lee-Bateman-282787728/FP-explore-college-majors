Homsher,"[2, 4]","Because I feel technical/craft deficiencies sink this film,  I'm not going to commment on the plot, except to say that the several storylines were not very well integrated. Some bits and pieces of this movie made me wonder what the actors could have achieved with better direction and a better script, but far too often their emotions changed so dramatically and unrealistically within a scene that is was imposible to take them seriously.  The music was sappy and distracting, playing so heavily over some scenes as to make the dialogue difficult to understand.  It was refreshing to see ""real"" looking actors but what they were given to say was many times laugh-out-loud silly and trite.  Not the worst movie I've seen, but one easily skipped.",2,unintentional (?)  camp,1244851200,"06 13, 2009",2009,745,"['feel', 'technical/craft', 'deficiencies', 'sink', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'commment', 'plot', 'say', 'several', 'storylines', 'were', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'integrated', 'bits', 'pieces', 'movie', 'made', 'wonder', 'what', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'better', 'direction', 'better', 'script', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'emotions', 'changed', 'so', 'dramatically', 'unrealistically', 'scene', 'was', 'imposible', 'take', 'seriously', 'music', 'was', 'sappy', 'distracting', 'playing', 'so', 'heavily', 'scenes', 'make', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'understand', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'real', 'looking', 'actors', 'what', 'were', 'given', 'say', 'was', 'many', 'times', 'laugh-out-loud', 'silly', 'trite', 'Not', 'worst', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'easily', 'skipped']",The Books Of John

1069869,A22ECY1OSXEVS1,B000PC72FO,Michael A. Brocato,"[4, 6]","This was a film I could watch on Instant Streaming as an Amazon Prime member.... so I thought I would give it a try one night that I was having problems sleeping. I did make it through the entire film, so it was not completely bad, but there are a lot of problems with this film.The overall plot is that John, the partner of the films main character Will, dies suddenly. They have been partners for twelve years. Will is in grief, and a few months later, while beginning the process of cleaning things left behind by John, discovers diaries (the books) that John wrote. In the course of reading them, he realizes how little he knew of his partners past life, and visits the hometown of John to put some closure to the situation.I don't want to give away details of the storyline which would be a spoiler, but the scripting/writing is rather cliche, and a viewer can easily guess the next next developments as scenes play out .  (Which is truly unfortunate that an independent film should suffer from low - quality ""Hollywood"" writing....  or maybe the problem was it was written with the intention of being done by a major studio, and no one would pick it up...???!!!???)Next, the acting.... sophomoric at best.  I have seen better acting on stage in high school productions and in community theater. If the actors in many scenes did more than a read through two or three times with a bit of direction, it seems as though better results could have been accomplished. The problematic writing does not lead to a great deal of character development. The dialogue has little that is subtle... so this shouldn't be rocket science.The overall production has little interest. The sound quality is not good. The ""cinematography"" is adequate. There is one scene that is interesting because of the use of color editing.SO THE BOTTOM LINE... This is not a movie that I would consider for purchase, but was okay as a ""free perk"". I wish there had been a trailer to view, but I suspect that it is not there because it might drive people away. Had I seen a trailer, I may not have watched it.",3,Problematic Independent film.
