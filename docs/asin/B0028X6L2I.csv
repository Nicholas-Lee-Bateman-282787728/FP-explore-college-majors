There is no English Dub on these DVDsnot even the ""edited version"" that's also present on the DVD which was dubbed.Bandai didn't even need to go find actors themselves.  They just had to use a Pre-existingaudio created by Animax Asia and their job would've been done.(Still looking for a copy of the Animax Dub -Purchasable not just lingering on the internet in choppy audio)",1,Animax Dub Not Here!,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",2012,509,"['one', 'notable', 'thing', 'DVD', 'uncut/unedited', 'DVD', 'version', 'series.However', 'Animax', 'DUBBED', 'series', 'back', 'English', 'Dub', 'DVDsnot', 'even', 'edited', 'version', 'also', 'present', 'DVD', 'was', 'dubbed.Bandai', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'need', 'go', 'find', 'actors', 'just', 'had', 'use', 'Pre-existingaudio', 'created', 'Animax', 'Asia', 'job', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'Still', 'looking', 'copy', 'Animax', 'Dub', '-Purchasable', 'not', 'just', 'lingering', 'internet', 'choppy', 'audio']",N/A

No DUB=no sale.This is what in fan circles is known as a ""glorified fansub""I won't dispute the rights holders to legitimately make money on a product thieves are offering for free, but an english dub would have added extra value for those who actually like myself enjoy dubs.I don't watch fansubs myself was just using that as a kind of example.I enjoy American voice over artists just as much as i do have favorites in japan, without even understanding a lick of japanese which is strange.I would of course give the series 4 stars i don't think it's a 5 though it is a go show.The pricing of this release is really low for the number of episodes included and i would give the value of the product 5 stars.the 1 star is to send a message to studio policies that are killing American Anime fandom which started with Dubs and The usually hated by the OTAKU Macek whose amalgamation of three japanese tv animes into robotech, cemented anime into the american consciousness.  Though not Macek only Sunwagon Productions brought us Space Battleship Yamato in the cut form as starblazers, also we had anime like transformers which people thought was american made when only the scripts were, as well as voltron.Dubs are not evil.  The japanese prefer as far as i know to watch the star trek television shows and star wars films in japanese.  Why don't we tell them they should be forced to watch them in english with subtitles only.",1,Was considering Buying it when it was announced to have an english dub,1251763200,"09 1, 2009",2009,1496,"['now', 'released', 'bare', 'bones', 'sub', 'only', 'extras', 'i', 'will', 'pass', 'DUB=no', 'sale.This', 'what', 'fan', 'circles', 'known', 'glorified', 'fansub', 'wo', ""n't"", 'dispute', 'rights', 'holders', 'legitimately', 'make', 'money', 'product', 'thieves', 'are', 'offering', 'free', 'english', 'dub', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'extra', 'value', 'who', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'dubs.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'fansubs', 'was', 'just', 'using', 'kind', 'example.I', 'enjoy', 'American', 'voice', 'artists', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'i', 'do', 'have', 'favorites', 'japan', 'even', 'understanding', 'lick', 'japanese', 'strange.I', 'would', 'course', 'give', 'series', '4', 'stars', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', '5', 'go', 'show.The', 'pricing', 'release', 'really', 'low', 'number', 'episodes', 'included', 'i', 'would', 'give', 'value', 'product', '5', 'stars.the', '1', 'star', 'send', 'message', 'studio', 'policies', 'are', 'killing', 'American', 'Anime', 'fandom', 'started', 'Dubs', 'usually', 'hated', 'OTAKU', 'Macek', 'amalgamation', 'three', 'japanese', 'tv', 'animes', 'robotech', 'cemented', 'anime', 'american', 'consciousness', 'not', 'Macek', 'only', 'Sunwagon', 'Productions', 'brought', 'Space', 'Battleship', 'Yamato', 'cut', 'form', 'starblazers', 'also', 'had', 'anime', 'transformers', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'american', 'made', 'when', 'only', 'scripts', 'were', 'as', 'well', 'voltron.Dubs', 'are', 'not', 'evil', 'japanese', 'prefer', 'as', 'far', 'i', 'know', 'watch', 'star', 'trek', 'television', 'shows', 'star', 'wars', 'films', 'japanese', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'should', 'be', 'forced', 'watch', 'english', 'subtitles', 'only']",N/A

1256307,A17SDDHZVA50EV,B0028X6L2I,Stephen P. Cseplo,"[3, 3]","From the same director and studio that brought us _Zettai Karen Children_ (not released in the US) comes the predecessor to that series, _Hayate no Gotoku_, _Hayate the Combat Butler_. At 52 episodes long, it is a major undertaking to watch the entire series though it is such a pleasant funny series that you get to the point of wanting it to go on forever. Having seen the entire series, the only content problem I found is that towards the end the studio seems to get bored with it and loose their way a bit. The middle is truly outstanding as they really hit their stride and is the best part of the series, imho. However, and here is the rub, it's US release illustrates a major reason why the anime industry finds itself in it's current quandry, namely over priced products. I would be first in line to aquire each DVD as released if pricing were in line with what it is, a light nonsensical series equivalent to Sailor Moon, but the industry continues to attempt to bring Japanese pricing (though not as extreme) to the US, and it simply will not work. No wonder the major US anime and manga distributors continue to hit the skids and many have gone out of business. It would be well priced at half to 2/3's. I'll wait for a reasonably priced box set.",5,Great Series but....,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",2009,1258,"['same', 'director', 'studio', 'brought', '_Zettai', 'Karen', 'Children_', 'not', 'released', 'US', 'predecessor', 'series', '_Hayate', 'Gotoku_', '_Hayate', 'Combat', 'Butler_', '52', 'episodes', 'long', 'major', 'undertaking', 'watch', 'entire', 'series', 'such', 'pleasant', 'funny', 'series', 'get', 'point', 'wanting', 'go', 'forever', 'Having', 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'only', 'content', 'problem', 'found', 'end', 'studio', 'get', 'bored', 'loose', 'way', 'bit', 'middle', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'really', 'hit', 'stride', 'best', 'part', 'series', 'imho', 'However', 'here', 'rub', 'US', 'release', 'major', 'reason', 'why', 'anime', 'industry', 'current', 'quandry', 'namely', 'priced', 'products', 'would', 'be', 'first', 'line', 'aquire', 'DVD', 'released', 'pricing', 'were', 'line', 'what', 'light', 'nonsensical', 'series', 'equivalent', 'Sailor', 'Moon', 'industry', 'attempt', 'bring', 'Japanese', 'pricing', 'not', 'extreme', 'US', 'simply', 'will', 'not', 'work', 'wonder', 'major', 'US', 'anime', 'manga', 'distributors', 'continue', 'hit', 'skids', 'many', 'have', 'gone', 'business', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'priced', 'half', '2/3', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'box', 'set']",N/A
