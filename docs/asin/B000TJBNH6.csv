Most everyone is familiar with these titles and all of them have been out prior to this release. However, Laurel & Hardy's March of the Wooden Soldiers has never been released in quite the way it has here - complete, uncut, excellent transfer and the original studio logo and title cards for --- Babes In Toyland! Finally, after years of television ""butchering"" and copyright battles, one of Laurel & Hardy's best is available as it was originally released.

1091087,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B000TJBNH6,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[1, 5]","Christmas magic can be hard to see. It's A Wonderful Life did not light up the box office, and CBS execs thought the Charlie Brown Christmas a bit lame. Yet both continue to draw huge audiences annually for their simple charm and honesty. They may have lacked the usual qualities that make films work, yet they clearly are loved by people the world over.Christmas magic is doubly hard to make. This package of three vaguely Christmas movies has some nice touches, but nothing that will make you eager for Thanksgiving and the opportunity to laugh and weep again. The Bishop's Wife has a number of delightful scenes, and some glorious acting, but for me at least felt a tad wooden. I just wasn't entranced, and the breath-takingly obvious ending and weird supernatural intervention was awkward. Not bad, but not much either.Pocketful of Miracles, Capra's valiant attempt to recapture the beauty of IAWL, flounders for a number of reasons. First, while the sets are beautiful, they are clearly and horribly phony. Nothing in this film looks vaguely real. Maybe if he had used the soft focus black and white I would have bought in, but from the first scene to the last, I was ever aware that this world was studio made, with no humans ever there before or after.I have never understood why Glenn Ford was a star. Here he dashes around flailing his arms and stomping his feet, all the while looking as believable as a three year old in the middle of a temper tantrum. Hope Lange was more beautiful than I remember, but also more limp. And Peter Falk plays the cartoon gangster who repeatedly reminded me of Robert Klein's routine on The Little Rascals, where everyone begins their sentences with ""Say.....""Not a bad film, with many great moments and a delightful supporting cast. But not a classic either.And while I am a massive fan of Laurel and Hardy, I had missed nothing by not seeing March of the Wooden Soldiers before. One tedious and forced sequence after another, interspersed with some bad operetta singing and head-scratching plot twists.",3,Not one to be pulled out annually,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,2046,"['Christmas', 'magic', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'see', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'did', 'not', 'light', 'up', 'box', 'office', 'CBS', 'execs', 'thought', 'Charlie', 'Brown', 'Christmas', 'bit', 'lame', 'continue', 'draw', 'huge', 'audiences', 'annually', 'simple', 'charm', 'honesty', 'may', 'have', 'lacked', 'usual', 'qualities', 'make', 'films', 'work', 'yet', 'clearly', 'are', 'loved', 'people', 'world', 'over.Christmas', 'magic', 'doubly', 'hard', 'make', 'package', 'three', 'vaguely', 'Christmas', 'movies', 'nice', 'touches', 'nothing', 'will', 'make', 'eager', 'Thanksgiving', 'opportunity', 'laugh', 'weep', 'again', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'number', 'delightful', 'scenes', 'glorious', 'acting', 'least', 'felt', 'tad', 'wooden', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'entranced', 'breath-takingly', 'obvious', 'ending', 'weird', 'supernatural', 'intervention', 'was', 'awkward', 'Not', 'bad', 'not', 'much', 'either.Pocketful', 'Miracles', 'Capra', 'valiant', 'attempt', 'recapture', 'beauty', 'IAWL', 'flounders', 'number', 'reasons', 'First', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'are', 'clearly', 'horribly', 'phony', 'Nothing', 'film', 'vaguely', 'real', 'Maybe', 'had', 'used', 'soft', 'focus', 'black', 'white', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'first', 'scene', 'last', 'was', 'ever', 'aware', 'world', 'was', 'studio', 'made', 'humans', 'ever', 'after.I', 'have', 'never', 'understood', 'why', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'was', 'star', 'Here', 'flailing', 'arms', 'stomping', 'feet', 'while', 'looking', 'as', 'believable', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'middle', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'Hope', 'Lange', 'was', 'more', 'beautiful', 'remember', 'also', 'more', 'limp', 'Peter', 'Falk', 'cartoon', 'gangster', 'who', 'repeatedly', 'reminded', 'Robert', 'Klein', 'routine', 'Little', 'Rascals', 'where', 'everyone', 'sentences', 'Say', '..', 'Not', 'bad', 'film', 'many', 'great', 'moments', 'delightful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'classic', 'either.And', 'am', 'massive', 'fan', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'had', 'missed', 'nothing', 'not', 'seeing', 'March', 'Wooden', 'Soldiers', 'before', 'One', 'tedious', 'forced', 'sequence', 'interspersed', 'bad', 'operetta', 'singing', 'head-scratching', 'plot', 'twists']",MGM Holiday Classics Collection: (The Bishop's Wife / March of the Wooden Soldiers / Pocketful of Miracles)

1091090,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,B000TJBNH6,Lover of English,"[1, 3]","I bought this MGM holiday package last year and just got around to watching it.  I already had The Bishop's Wife (colorized) that I had taped on VHS and I had Pocketful of Miracles that I bought as VHS and wanted to replace these two on DVD.  I watched The Bishop's Wife on Christmas Day and although it was not colorized it still remains a holiday favorite. It depicts an American culture of a much gentler time, plus, American actresses in the 30s and 40s were much more highly accomplished than their counterparts of today and are a joy to watch.I had read a few negative reviews of Pocketful of Miracles and couldn't understand why.  I thought the movie was wonderful until I started watching it in the MGM version this morning.  I still have a full screen TV and first of all the wide screen aspect was too severe.  Then there was something wrong with the color.  I fiddled around with my color correction for a while but then finally gave up.  If I were watching this for the first time I think I would have given it a poor review as well.  This version has a harshness that is absent in the VHS version.  I guess I won't donate the VHS to the library but will keep it for as long as my doddering old VCR comtinues to play.",3,Disappointed in Pocketful of Miracles,1293321600,"12 26, 2010",2010,1229,"['bought', 'MGM', 'holiday', 'package', 'last', 'year', 'just', 'got', 'around', 'watching', 'already', 'had', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'colorized', 'had', 'taped', 'VHS', 'had', 'Pocketful', 'Miracles', 'bought', 'VHS', 'wanted', 'replace', 'two', 'DVD', 'watched', 'Bishop', 'Wife', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'was', 'not', 'colorized', 'still', 'holiday', 'favorite', 'American', 'culture', 'much', 'gentler', 'time', 'American', 'actresses', '30s', '40s', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'counterparts', 'today', 'are', 'joy', 'watch.I', 'had', 'read', 'few', 'negative', 'reviews', 'Pocketful', 'Miracles', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'wonderful', 'started', 'watching', 'MGM', 'version', 'morning', 'still', 'have', 'full', 'screen', 'TV', 'first', 'wide', 'screen', 'aspect', 'was', 'too', 'severe', 'Then', 'was', 'something', 'wrong', 'color', 'fiddled', 'around', 'color', 'correction', 'while', 'then', 'finally', 'gave', 'up', 'were', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'poor', 'review', 'well', 'version', 'harshness', 'absent', 'VHS', 'version', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'donate', 'VHS', 'library', 'will', 'keep', 'as', 'long', 'doddering', 'old', 'VCR', 'comtinues', 'play']",MGM Holiday Classics Collection: (The Bishop's Wife / March of the Wooden Soldiers / Pocketful of Miracles)
1091091,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B000TJBNH6,Robert Badgley,"[32, 37]","This holiday three DVD collection released by MGM gives us alot in a small package for a reasonable price.First off the mark is Frank Capra's ""Pocketful of Miracles"" ***.It is a story of a street vendor/walker by the name of Apple Annie(Bette Davis)whose apples are considered to be a good luck charm for the local gangster Dave the Dude(Glenn Ford).Annie it seems has raised enough money over the years off the street to send her daughter to Spain to be raised and educated(Ann Margarets'debut performance).Now her daughter is coming back to see her and be wed not knowing Annies' true self.Dave steps in and tries to help.It is a long movie but has a terrific cast including Peter Falk who does a great job as Daves' street wise cracking ""associate"".But unfortunately even though the movie has alot of nice moments throughout its' pacing and story line is uneven.The end scene comes unexpectedly swift and is in a way anti-climactic.The holiday season is mentioned only fleetingly and I have never felt this much of a holiday entry as compared to say ""It's a Wonderful Life"" which is a definite classic of the genre and in a league far above this movie.Not one of Capra's best by far.The next entry is ""The Bishops'Wife"" **** 1/2.This is just a lovely and,if I can use the word,gentle movie.It involves a Bishop Brougham(David Niven)and his wife(Loretta Young).Both are currently struggling with their lives(especially the Bishop) to raise funds to build a new cathedral.In steps angel Dudley(Cary Grant) into the works to help out the pair.In time we see that not only are the pair struggling with the new building but with their marriage also.Dudley deals with the Bishops' wife more on a personal level(much to the Bishops' chagrin) and steers the Bishop onto more productive paths in a more indirect way.In the end,in sometimes the most unexpected but heart warming ways,Dudley finally accomplishes what he set out to do.This is a wonderful movie,a great change of pace and like ""Miracle on 34th Street"" has that ""gentle"" feel to it.I highly recommend it to all.The last entry and the cream of the crop is Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's ""Babes in Toyland"" ***** .To be more familiar with modern audiences they have put the TV version name ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" on the box cover for all three of the movies and on the individual slip case cover.But this is NOT one of the many cut,pasted,colour copied,sloppily transferred wanna-be's that are currently on the market(see my previous reviews on those).I am finally relieved to be able to tell you this is the ORIGINAL theatrical version with the original title cards intact from beginning to lovely end!!The story involves two fairy tale type characters Ollie Dee(Oliver Hardy) and Stannie Dum(Stan Laurel) who live in Toyland with many fairy tale characters.They eventually butt heads with the meanest man in Toyland Barnaby who gets the two in trouble on some trumped up charges.He then proceeds to get Tom-Tom,a rival for the hand of Bo-Peep,sent away on false charges to Bogeyland.The Boys exonerate Tom-Tom and set about to rescue him and Bo Beep from the clutches of the bogeymen and Barnaby who has decided to invade and take over Toyland with his hairy hoard.In the end Barnaby and the Bogeymen are defeated and they all live happily ever after.It's a wonderful tale that has delighted viewers for over 70 years(!) and thanks to MGM we FINALLY have it released the way it was meant to be and SHOULD be seen.The print is excellent.In conclusion the ""Holiday Collection"" is well worth the price for your money considering what you get.Each movie is in a thin pak and none have any special features but the titles are well worth(and more) the modest price being charged.""Pocketful of Dreams"" is the weakest entry in the pack while ""The Bishop's Wife"" and ""Babes in Toyland"" are the stars here.The latter is especially signifigant as it's in its' original form and COMPLETE!Enjoy.",4,Lots of bang(and a surprise!) for your movie dollar.,1201046400,"01 23, 2008",2008,3947,"['holiday', 'three', 'DVD',
