You have great writing, superb acting and top notch special effects. But my favorite thing about Stargate SG-1 is the camaraderie between the characters. Not just with the SG-1 team but with lesser characters too. One of my favorites is when Col. Jack O'Neill talks to Thor. You feel the connection between them even though in the back of your mind you know it's just Richard Dean Anderson talking to a puppet. If I had to pick a flaw in the DVD collection, it would be that they are only up to season 2 when the series is starting season 7.

Fans who had seen the later seasons need to watch the core of the show and that begins with the first half of the series and the first 2 seasons.

We get to see more of some of the races that were introduced in the first season, such as the Nox, and the Asgard, and even the Tok'ra, the latter two races being sworn enemies of the evil Goa'uld, although they fight them in different ways. The Tok'ra do their thing in secret while the Asgard fight openly in huge battleships, which by the way are really COOL to look at.My personal favorite episodes of the season are Thor's Chariot and The Fifth Race, both epsisodes dealing with the Asgard. I like the Asgard because we learned that the aliens picked up at Roswell NM in the 40's were Asgard. Cool, huh?This season could be a stand-alone, meaning, even if you don't own any of the other season dvds, you could pick this one up and understand what's going on, and enjoy the new material.

Season 2 has begun to realize said potential.  Many of the episodes this season expanded on ideas and arcs from the first season, as well as introducing new ideas, characters, and locations.  For example, we meet Thor (in his true form), as well as some of the other Asguard, a powerful alliance with the Tok'Ra is formed, the NID storyline is taken in new directions, and we learn about the builders of the Stargate system as well as the origins of the intergalactic U.N. from the first season episode, &quot;The Torment of Tantalus&quot;.  We also meet some new Goa'uld system lords, as well as see the destruction of an old enemy.The actors (Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, Don S. Davis, and Teryl Rohtery) all grew in their roles as Col. Jack O'Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Capt. Sam Carter, Teal'c, Gen. George Hammond, and Dr. Janet Frasier.  Not only did they prove their worth as their own characters, some of them got the chance to play others as well in the episode, &quot;Holdiay&quot;.  I'm sure that Judge liked that one because he got to play O'Neill, who is Teal'c's polar opposite.The storylines were improved this year (not that they were bad last year), with some great examples being: &quot;The Serpent's Lair&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Duty&quot;, &quot;Prisoners&quot;, &quot;Thor's Chariot&quot;, &quot;Secrets&quot;, &quot;The Tok'Ra, Pts. 1 and 2&quot;, &quot;Spirits&quot;, &quot;Touchstone&quot;, &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, &quot;The Fifth Race&quot;, &quot;Serpent's Song&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;1969&quot;, and &quot;Out of Mind&quot;.

702190,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000067DNC,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[6, 8]","The second season of STARGATE SG1 produced a series that is starting to mature. The plot lines do not rely so much on finding old earth civilization scattered all about the universe. New and creative ideas are introduced. The season also matures in that there are many plot lines begun and left for later episodes to be resolved. Some of these are not even resolved during the course of the season. The show makes for entertaining television even if a lot of the science is hokey. Personally, the science does not bother me near as much as the linguistics. Practically everyone in the universe speaks English.Synopses of the episodes appear below:The season starts off with a bang and resolves last season's cliffhanger. The SG1 crew had violated orders and transported themselves to the location where Daniel suspected the invasion fleet was leaving from. They found themselves on one of the ships participating in the invasion of Earth. The episode opens with the fleet's arrival. Bumbling politicians on Earth don't realize the threat and it is only a matter of time before the invasion begins. The only hope is the SG1 team who will have to recruit allies, destroy both ships and give up any chance of surviving themselves.In the Line of Duty - While evacuating some refugees, Capt. Clark gets infested with a ghoul. The SG crew manages to capture her before she can wreak too much damage. Her ghoul makes a startling claim. It claims to be part of a ghoul resistance. Still, no one trusts it. They think she is part of a plot to wreak destruction on Earth and other happenings seem to bear this out. It seems another ghoul is on the loose. Clark's ghoul claims that the other one is an assassin sent to kill her. There does not seem to be much chance of the captain surviving no matter the truth of the situation.Prisoners - The SG1 team makes its way to a world that seems deserted at first. Soon, however, they encounter a man who asks them for help. Not knowing what else to say, they offer their help and are then caught up in a bright beam of light. The next thing they know, they are before a tribunal charging them with trespassing and helping a prisoner to escape. Both charges carry life imprisonment and the transportation to the prison planet is by way of another stargate. The prison is very hellish and is an environment of ""might makes right"". They are aided by a mysterious old woman.  With her help, they manage to get the local gate working and with her, return to Earth. There, she learns all about the SG program and they learn they she was called ""the destroyer of worlds"". This genie won't go back into the bottle.The Gamekeeper - in a rather silly episode, the SG1 team finds themselves on a seemingly deserted but otherwise lovely planet. Besides the park like environment, all they find are a bunch of strange pods with humans in them. While investigate the pods, they are captured and find themselves reliving their worst memories. They are actually present in the tragedies of their own lives and, worse, they have a strange audience. Part of the audience is the gamekeeper is seems devoted to forcing them to explore the endless variations inherent in their tragedies. The crew just wants out.Need - The team investigates a planet that seems to be inhabited by ghoul slaves. When Daniel rescues a princess, they learn that the planet is not inhabited by ghouls. Instead, they are humans who managed to throw off the ghouls several centuries before. They maintain their independence by continuing to mine the stargate mineral and sending it through to the ghouls who assume that everything is operating normally and have no idea that the humans are free. Things get complicated when the team is sentenced to labor in the mines and they get worse when the princess falls in love with Daniel. She uses one of the healing sarcophagi to fix him up after he is hurt and repeated exposure gets him addicted to this unhealthy process. In the process, he begins to lose his mind.Thor's Chariot - Stargate command gets a message from the planet protected by Thor last season. The ghouls have invaded and things look grim. Since the ghouls were only able to get a foothold because the SG1 team destroyed Thor's hammer, they feel a responsibility to go back and help. While part of the team tries to hold the ghouls off, the others go off in search of the legendary Thor's chariot. They are hoping it is a weapon to fight the ghouls. Instead, it turns out to be substantially less...and more. They have a new ally.Message in a Bottle - The SG1 crew explores a world that shows evidence of a highly advanced civilization which has been extinct for millennia. They bring back an artifact in order to study it. Expose to energy activates it and it begins to reproduce and take over the complex. They think of it as a disease and treat it as such with limited effect but they are fighting a losing battle. It turns out that it is not just a disease, it is an alien intelligence and the problem is how to communicate with it before everyone dies.Family - The SG1 crew gets word that Teal'c's son has been abducted by Apothis. Everyone realizes that this has been done so that Teal'c can be lured back and captured. It's just not that simple. Teal'c finds that his wife has been remarried to an old friend and jealousy rears its head. What makes matters worse is that the rescue attempt on the son does not go off as planned. He has become an agent for Apothis and he has a larger goal than just capturing his father. He wants to destroy the Earth.Secrets - This is a two story episode. Daniel and Teal'c head back to Abydos to keep a 1 year reunion promise and see that the stargate there is not buried. When they get there, he finds his long lost wife, pregnant by Apothis. It seems that the ghouls go dormant when their hosts are pregnant. She is due to deliver in several days and then the ghoul will awake again. Meanwhile, another ghoul, an enemy of Apothis, wants to kidnap the child. Back on earth, Col. O'Neill and Capt. Clark head to Washington to receive the air medal for their part in defeating the ghoul ships. While there, a reporter tries to confirm rumors of the stargate's existence. He knows too much and there has been a leak. The consequences of that are deadly.Bane - When the SG! Team investigates a new planet, they find signs of a high civilization but which is completely devoid of anyone. Then they are attacked by the ""mosquitoes"" from hell; giant things, about the size of bats with scorpion-like tales. Teal'c is bitten and the crew makes a hasty escape through the stargate. The damage is already done. Teal'c gets sicker and sicker. He's dying and even the ghoul inside of him cannot help. It seems that the organism laid some eggs and is feeding directly off of his body. When he ""hatches"" he will spread the bugs and humanity will be doomed. Meanwhile, Teal'c is driven by powerful instincts to hide and tries to do so by escaping the mountain facility and fleeing into the city.The Tok'Ra Part 1 - Several episodes back, Capt. Clark became the unwitting host of a ghoul. It turns out that was not a run of the mill ghoul but a member of resistance movement. That ghoul gave its life saving hers. Ever since, she has had strange memories and thoughts. They are the leftovers of her former ghoul. Now, SG1 has gone in search of this resistance movement called the Tok'Ra. They wish to form an alliance. The Tok'Ra, however, are suspicious. They are doubly so since the earth party evinces a reluctance to serve as hosts. Since the alliance looks like it will not take place, the Tok'Ra are also reluctant to let the stargate team return to Earth, lest their secret be revealed.The Tok'Ra Part 2 - As the last episode ended, the Stargate team was being held by the Tok'Ra to keep their secrets safe. Captain Clark had just received word that her dying father was nearing his end. This gives rise to an idea which may just save his life and cement the alliance. Tok'Ra and ghouls both heal their hosts. The former is a mutual symbiote and the latter is the parasite but both heal the body of the host. With that option before them, their lies hope for the Captain, her father, the alliance and the war against the Ghouls. They just have to get it done before the ghoul invasion ships arrive.Spirits - The SG4 team is overdue back from a planet where they were supposed to be mining a special mineral for use in war against the ghouls and the SG1 team is dispatched to find out what's going on. They find a Native American culture which seems exceedingly friendly but adverse to the idea of mining their mountains. When asked about the missing team, the locals tell them that they are ""with the spirits."" Fortunately, this does not mean they are dead. They literally mean with their spirits. These take the form of wolves, ravens and others to be expected in a Native American culture but there is more to these spirits than meets the eye. They are not who they seem and they are very powerful. They also don't behave well when some of them are brought back through the star gate.Touchstone - Some time back, the Stargate Command encountered a piece of technology used to control the weather on another planet. A little free time gives SG1 an opportunity to go back to that planet and try and study the device. When they get there, they find a chilly reception from the natives who believe that SG1 stole the ""touchstone"" device. It seems that people dressed like stargate teams came through and took the device. As a result, the planet is freezing. The SG1 teams tries to investigate this strange happening but they hit a brick wall in their investigation. Then it turns out that politics are involved and that the Antarctic gate has turned up missing. The rest of the mission takes place on earth as competing agendas come to light.A Matter of Time - As one of the Stargate teams tries to flee back through the gate to safety on earth, something goes terribly wrong. They never make it through and the people earthside have a hard time figuring out why they do not and an even harder time figuring why the gate will not close. Then they start to notice strange things. Everything near the gate seems to slow down. When they finally get an image, they see that the planet where the far gate is located is too near a black hole and time dilation has become a factor. Time is slowing down near the hole. This is a problem because the gravitational field of the black hole is being transmitted through the gate to earth. That is why the gate will not close. Time dilation is starting to affect things on this side as well. This is a good episode if your knowledge of physics is particularly weak. That is true of most but especially in this one. Still, it is a good story.The Fifth Race - When Daniel Jackson is working on deciphering the writing, found in one of their explorations, he finds evidence of another advanced race. When the team goes to investigate further, they find themselves in a high tech but abandoned facility. The colonel inadvertently activates some sort of ray and is knocked out. He seems none the worse for wear at first but he starts adding bits of a strange language to his speech. As time progresses, he speaks more and more in the new language and begins to loose the ability to speak in his own. As a partial compensation, he becomes a genius. He also feels compelled to build strange objects that nobody, including the colonel himself, understands. Eventually, he jury rigs the gate to transport himself to a destination much further than any they have ever traveled to before. When he goes through, he encounters the race of Thor and learns...much.Serpent's Song - Stargate Command gets what seems to be a communication from the Tok'Ra and SG1 heads out to meet them at the assigned coordinates. Instead of finding the Tok'Ra, they find something very different. A ghoul ship crashes near them. It crashes because it is being chased by more ghoul ships and they are firing on it. When the team looks for survivors, they are surprised to find Apothis, their arch enemy. He is dying and seeks asylum. He wants a new host and offers knowledge. It is a tempting offer but the temptations diminish when it is learned that Apothis is wanted by a much more powerful ghoul who wants him as a prisoner for torture and retribution. Things get difficult because of the human moral code. It does not seem right to hand over even the most despised enemy for a fate like that but humanity's survival may dictate that they do just that.Holiday - The SG1 team visits a new planet and finds lots of high tech goodies and a single, doddering old man. Teal'c recognizes the old man as a long time enemy of the ghouls who has in his time caused them much trouble before being captured, tortured and escaping. Now, he seems a harmless old man until he and Daniel both touch one of the devices at the same time. Doing so makes Daniel act strangely and the old man loses consciousness. They all evacuate through the stargate and all seems strange except for Daniel being exhausted. The old man doesn't get a say since he is still out of it. Daniel is taken home to get some rest and all seems well. When the old man comes to, everyone is in for a surprise. He is Daniel. Their minds have switched bodies. While search teams are sent into town to retrieve the body of Daniel, Teal'c and the colonel go back to the planet to retrieve the mind transference device. While doing so, those two get switched. This leads to some laughs as the colonel acts the straight man and Teal'c gets to play it up for laughs. When they finally capture the alien with Daniel's body, he is not willing to switch back. He figures that he has given enough to fight the ghouls and that humanity owes him a new life.One False Step - The SG1 team investigate a pretty amazing planet. It is amazing primarily because its humanoid inhabitants DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. Based on the progress of the series thus far, such places are rare in the universe. The natives of this planet are fairly primitive and seem to have very little in the way of vocal skill. Not long after the team arrives, the natives start dropping like flies. There are all sorts of theories explaining this involving the transmission of disease. A cut finger here, a sneeze there and the like... Things get more frightening for the team when some of its own members start to feel ill but their symptoms are different and the epidemiology does not seem to work out for it having a common source even after alien physiologies are taken into account. The real cause of both diseases is fairly unexpected when it is discovered. This is not the best episode by far but it is refreshing to find one that doesn't depend on English as a universal language.Show and Tell - Stargate Command is startled when their gate is activated by parties unknown and then, somehow, their iris defense is bypassed. When the intruder finally comes through, they are even more startled to find that he is a human child. The child bears a warning. Members of his ""mother's"" species, extremely non human, want to eradicate humanity and all other species that can serve has hosts for the ghouls. Later, it is learned that a member of that same species who issued the warning has come through the Stargate weeks before. They are going to be tough to defend against because they are invisible. The help of the Tok'ra are needed. This is a good episode even though it plays even more loosely than normal with modern physics.1969 - Sooner or later, it seems as if every Sci-Fi series has to make a try at the grandfather paradox and try the idea of time travel. SG1 got to that point with this episode. The team accidentally goes back to 1969 and are arrested by the military. They manage to escape and must find their way to the stargate and get home. Explaining this episode further would be fruitless but ponder the implications of the SG1 team posing as hippies on their way to Woodstock. Ponder it especially with Teal'c in mind.Out of Mind - End of season means retrospective time. This episode opens up with Col. O'Neill being revived from suspended animation. He has been out for over 70 years. He is told that he came through the stargate in a state of frozen, suspended animation. The rest of his crew came through dead. It is only now that the technology has been developed to safely revive him. Everyone wants to know, however, what happened. They use some sort of mind probe to play back his memories and we have the ""benefit"" of watching portions of previous episodes. The problem is that things are not as they seem. The others are alive and they too are being revived and having their memories probed. This means more flashbacks. The actual situation is even more complex. Teal'c is the only one not to find himself in this strange situation. He is at SGC and time has not progressed. Everyone wants to know what's going on. Hathor knows. Besides being a retrospective, this is also the end of season cliffhanger.",4,A Bit More Maturity,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",2006,17086,"['second', 'season', 'STARGATE', 'SG1', 'produced', 'series',

With ""The Serpent's Lair"" we see the conclusion to the 4-part conclusion of Season One's last 3 episodes.  And it's a doosey, let me tell ya.  And if you recall, the cliffhanger introduced us to a quite unique Goa'uld weapon commonly known as Zat Gun.  The first shot incompacitates, the second kills, the third disentagrates.  Well, Season 2 sees extended use of this weapon and it becomes an exciting new special effect.But anyway enough of the Zat gun talk.  Season 2 sees SG-1 come into its own.  Lots of good episodes in this ste and I haven't even watched half of them yet.  Lots of good Goa'uld episodes.  In the episode ""Thor's Chariot"" we once again see the Horus-type System Lord Goa'ulds.  We also find out that these are Apothisis' mortal enemies.  We are also first introduced to the Asgard named ""Thor""  in an interactive hologram.In Season 2 lots of loose ends are tied up from Season 1 as well as several new plot elements are revieled subtletly.  The existance of the 6th Season's Prometheus battleship program is revieled in the Season opener.In the episode ""Secrets"" we find out what happened to Sha're, Daniel's wife from Abydos.  This discovery results in another confrontation with the Horus group System Lords.We also discover the Tok'ra in this Season.  The Tok'ra are a group of Jaffa who are in rebellion from the evil System Lords and the Serpent Gods.  We see the Tok'ra in many up-coming episodes in later seasons.So all in all, Season 2 has become known as one of the best seasons of the series and I can see why.  There really isn't one bad episode in the bunch and we see a lot of new plot arcs starting and other getting moved along from earlier.  The humor is still there and so is the episode ending ""oh boys"" (as in they've just let a bad guy get away) as the credits roll.  So if you like SG-1 in anyway, or are wondering just how good this series is, pick up Season 2 and if you hadn't already Season 1 as well.

702207,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000067DNC,Robert Moore,"[3, 4]","There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X-FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE. There are a variety of reasons for this in each case. With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates. Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode. This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background. Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel. This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld. The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer. But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better. All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale. Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one. The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised. Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed. STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times. My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode. If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget. I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap. Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters. We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father. His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts. Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer. This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut. Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen. Although I've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.",5,Good first season is followed by a superb second season,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,3907,"['have', 'years', 'been', 'number', 'great', 'shows', 'followed', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'second', 'one', 'including', 'X-FILES', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'FARSCAPE', 'are', 'variety', 'reasons', 'case', 'STARGATE', 'increasingly', 'complex', 'storyline', 'relations', 'various', 'races', 'cultures', 'access', 'stargates', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'basically', 'stargate-of-the-week', 'format', 'week', 'individual', 'adventure', 'real', 'connections', 'other', 'episode', 'format', 'usually', 'preferred', 'network', 'executives', 'new', 'viewers', 'join', 'show', 'much', 'background', 'Serious', 'fans', 'other', 'hand', 'vastly', 'prefer', 'complex', 'storylines', 'where', 'week', 'episode', 'not', 'stand', 'own', 'embedded', 'ongoing', 'saga', 'almost', 'chapter', 'huge', 'novel', 'been', 'probably', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'ongoing', 'struggle', 'creative', 'talent', 'network', 'bureaucracy', 'own', 'hope', 'success', 'shows', 'LOST', 'will', 'pave', 'way', 'more', 'complex', 'formats.Season', 'Two', 'not', 'tell', 'single', 'unified', 'story', 'way', 'FARSCAPE', 'BUFFY', 'THE', 'VAMPIRE', 'SLAYER', 'did', 'start', 'spinning', 'out', 'largely', 'political', 'struggle', 'five', 'races', 'only', 'few', 'have', 'met', 'end', 'season', 'aligned', ""Goa'uld"", 'STARGATE', 'story', 'end', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'simple', 'affair', 'end', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'already', 'sufficiently', 'complex', 'make', 'following', 'details', 'difficult', 'newcomer', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'season', 'long', 'arc', 'individual', 'episodes', 'improved', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'writers', 'came', 'know', 'characters', 'better', 'improvement', 'show', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'not', 'unexpected', 'was', 'delightful', 'nonetheless.The', 'only', 'sour', 'note', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'season', 'finale', 'Most', 'shows', 'try', 'build', 'up', 'dramatic', 'season-ending', 'episode', 'sums', 'up', 'everything', 'happened', 'season', 'propels', 'show', 'next', 'one', 'season', 'finale', 'Season', 'Two', 'STARGATE', 'be', 'one', 'lamest', 'ever', 'devised', 'Most', 'problem', 'most', 'episode', 'was', 'constructed', 'segments', 'previous', 'episodes', 'were', 'simply', 'replayed', 'STAR', 'TREK', 'NEXT', 'GENERATION', 'used', 'method', 'few', 'times', 'guess', 'latter', 'show', 'used', 'cheap', 'way', 'creating', 'new', 'episode', '20', 'minutes', 'air', 'time', 'consisted', 'clips', 'old', 'shows', 'then', 'had', 'dramatically', 'lowered', 'operating', 'budget', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'why', 'STARGATE', 'employed', 'method', 'season', 'finale', 'perhaps', 'were', 'over', 'budget', 'had', 'choice', 'go', 'cheap', 'Nonetheless', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'false', 'note', 'otherwise', 'marvelous', 'season.As', 'Season', 'One', 'story', 'largely', 'focused', 'four', 'members', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'team', 'other', 'character', 'functioning', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'number', 'characters', 'who', 'reappear', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'most', 'important', 'being', 'General', 'Jacob', 'Carter', 'Samantha', 'father', 'importance', 'show', 'cemented', 'two-part', 'episode', ""Tok'ra"", 'group', 'rebel', ""Goa'uld"", 'opposed', 'regular', ""Goa'uld"", 'only', 'entering', 'symbiotes', 'willing', 'hosts', 'Sam', 'father', 'dying', 'cancer', ""Tok'ra"", 'Selmak', 'host', 'dying', 'approached', 'become', 'host', 'Selmak', 'can', 'cure', 'cancer', 'also', 'wonderful', 'resolution', 'one', 'favorite', 'moments', 'season', 'when', 'Sam', 'father', 'strings', 'get', 'admitted', 'NASA', 'space', 'program', 'potential', 'astronaut', 'Not', 'knowing', 'work', 'Stargate', 'program', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'interest', 'going', 'outer', 'space.All', 'remarkable', 'season', 'one', 'finest', 'Sci-fi', 'series', 'television', 'seen', ""'ve"", 'never', 'forgiven', 'Sci-fi', 'channel', 'failing', 'renew', 'FARSCAPE', 'keeping', 'fine', 'show', 'alive', 'least', 'partially', 'redeemed', 'eyes']",Stargate SG-1 Season 2

Gairwyn, who was first introduced in the episodeThor's Hammer, has sent a message through the stargate with the hope that SG-1 will return and aid in their fight against the Goa'uld. Of course the team venture to help and head through the gate. After their arrival the team see the effects of the Goa'uld occupation after Thor's hammer was destroyed in the previous episode.Their arrival does not go unnoticed as the Goa'uld discover them shortly after arrival. After escaping their first contact with the Goa'uld they set out to find Kendra who may have left behind a clue to fending off the occupiers. Finding the tools left by Kendra, Carter finds out that she can use Goa'uld technology with the aid of the naquadah in her blood. During a conversation with the locals it is discovered that an ancient weapons depot may have been left by Thor. Dr. Jackson and Carter set out to find the weapons cache as Teal'c and O'Neill work with the locals to fight off the Goa'uld.As time goes on Dr. Jackson and Carter solve the riddles surrounding the weapons cache and Teal'c and O'Neill successfully hold off the Goa'uld until Thor can come in and kick some butt.(Spoilers End)My thoughts:At its core the episode speaks to the responsibility of the SGC and SG-1 to the worlds they have visited. The effects of a technologically advanced, intelligent team of explores on a worlds natural growth is undeniable. This episode attempts to address the responsibility of the team to the effects they have created. Of course SG-1 are the heroes, they would never allow their activity to endanger anyone they may have crossed and they set out to repair the damage they have done here.In the end not only do they set things straight with the locals but also set the stage for future episodes with the introduction of the Asgard. Future episodes will expand on the Asgard storyline but this episode is the first to really bring them into the stargate fold.I particularly liked the events surrounding Dr. Jackson and Carter as they attempt to open the weapons cache. The visual/special effects are always great but in this episode they are superb.
