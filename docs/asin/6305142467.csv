I'm sure most people interested in buying this video have some idea of the plot, etc. so I thought I would  write something useful for those trying to decided between widescreen vs.  pan and scan because I have seen both versions.  If you have a big tv, I  would definately reccomend the widescreen.  But if you have a smaller tv, I  would think twice about it because the widescreen is really narrow- much  more narrow than the ads, which are midway width-wise between the pan and  scan and widescreen versions.  It depends on what you are buying the video  for.  If you are a purist, or are buying it just for the &quot;bee  scene&quot; I would go with the widescreen (the bee scene is alot better on  widescreen), but if you are going for general action flick entertainment, I  would get the pan and scan version!

I was introduced to a great show with a great cast.Since watching season one on DVD i kept house hunting to find my old VHS tape. Unfortunately, i could not find it anywhere.

I'm told it fits in between season 5 and season 6, but really it's a pretty effective story as a stand-alone.Fox Muldur and Dana Skully are in front of a review board for having done more than they were asked to do. This is typical of the series, but a movie audience might not know this. They were in Texas when the FBI regional office in Dallas was blown up, and they were accused of not doing enough to see that the building was empty. Suspicion fell on Muldur because he found the bomb which was concealed in a soda dispensing machine. One of the local agents said he could defuse it, and ordered everyone out of the building. But he made no attempt to defuse the bomb, blowing himself up with the building.Two fire fighters and a small boy were also reported as killed in the explosion, but in fact Skully autopsied one of the bodies and discovered that they were already dead when the bomb went off. And the cause of death made it clear that the bombing was to conceal the cause of death. From here, faithful followers of the TV series can probably predict much of the plot.Still, there are exciting adventures, amazing location shots, and really horrible monsters.

451377,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,6305142467,Busy Body,"[1, 2]","I will always consider The X-Files to be the greatest TV programme of the 1990's - maybe of all-time, but that may be pushing it a bit. I have been an avid viewer for years now and think it's a great shame that it's finally ended. Even so, The X-Files is a TV show that will never be forgotten. Repeats will still be shown in decades time. After Season 5 of this amazing TV show, Chris Carter (creator/director) decided to make a big-screen film to tie up a few loose ends that occured in the previous seasons...The film opens in the past - 35,000 BC actually in North Texas. It's a cold and barren place, probably around the time of the Ice Age. Something happens that we know nothing about, but will set the way forward for the rest of the film when two primates are attacked by what seems to be an alien. After this, we move to present day Dallas, Texas where the FBI are investigating a terrorist bomb threat in the Federal Building. We shortly meet our two heroes, agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In short, we're told that the X-Files have been closed but that Mulder and Scully are still partnered. Scully is somewhat exasperated because her partner is again being unorthodox and searching another building across the street from the one the rest of the Bureau is searching. Mulder and Scully soon learn that the bomb is in the building opposite the one suspected. An FBI agent claims he can defuse the bomb - but he doesn't. The building is evacuated as the FBI Agent just sits there as the seconds tick away. The building does explode, but instead of Mulder and Scully being hailed as heroes, they're hauled in front of an inquiry to explain why five people died instead of the countless number that would have died had the bomb not been discovered. Thinking this to be a cover-up of something much more massive, Mulder and Scully begin going on an undercover hunt for significant clues as to the reasons for the deaths of the three deceased, and Scully concludes that what killed them consists of a new form of life that drains away the nutrients of the human body. Moreover, as they continue their explorations, under the watchful eye of several conspirators that have taken different sides, they find that there is a much larger cover-up, one that holds the key to the destruction of all mankind and the beginning of a new species...Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil (Martin Landau) is supposedly an old friend of Mulder's father - but this is the X-Files, so who can you trust? Kurtzweil supplies Mulder with what he believes to be vital and secret government information that helps Mulder and Scully uncover the truth. Kurtzweil writes books on alien conspiracies, although no one believes him. Mulder and Scully investigate unmarked tanker trucks that supposedly carry an alien virus. They are led to the desert when crop fields are being grown. Scully is stung by a wasp later on and is infected with this alien virus. She is taken away to Antarctica by these alien foes in human form to join the rest of the humans who have been infected with this virus. Mulder doesn't know the whereabouts of Scully, but is helped by an unknown, known only as 'The Well-Manicured Man' in the credits. The Well-Manicured Man works for the FBI and is trying to keep the truth underwraps. He decides to put an end to it by giving Mulder a vaccine to the virus to help Scully, knowing his life will be over once it's found out what he tells Mulder. Until the Dallas incident, the FBI believed that the virus would simply control the entire worldy population - that mass-infection would make them a slave race - imagine their surprise when the aliens began to gestate. Along with the vaccine to the virus, the man gives Mulder the co-ordinates in Antarctica to the location of where Scully is. Mulder has 96 hours to arrive at Wilkes Land, Antarctica to save Scully before it's too late. As the film draws nearer to the end, we learn a lot more about what's going on - not the whole truth, of course (this is the X-Files, don't you know?!). Millions of years ago, aliens arrived on planet Earth. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age in the form of an evolved pathogen, waiting to be re-constituted by the alien race when it comes to colonize Earth, using the human race as hosts. Against this, the FBI has no defence but this weak vaccine given to Mulder by the unknown man. With the information and cure in hand, Mulder sets off to Antarctica to rescue Scully from the aliens. This plot to the film may sound incredibly corny, yet it is phenomenally believable and totally absorbing. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson give exceptional performances in the X-Files movie and the plot is intriguing and engrossing to say the least. The film can also be very moving at times, especially the hallway scene where Mulder and Scully almost kiss and the final five minutes in Antarctica. Other co-stars includes X-Files series regulars Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and a special appearance from The Lone Gunmen. Will Mulder save Scully from the alien race? And will the truth finally be revealed to the rest of the world? Watch it and see!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Regardless of whether your a viewer of the X-Files or not, the film version is an absolute must-see for everyone. If you've never watched the series, once you've watched the film version of the X-Files, you will, without a shadow of a doubt, want to see more. This is the main source that introduced me to the X-Files phenomenon - and I'm sure I wasn't the only one. The X-Files movie is one of the greatest films of the 1990's as is the TV show - buy this superb film from Amazon now.

451380,A1S3C5OFU508P3,6305142467,Charles Ashbacher,"[2, 2]","While the story has a great deal of exciting action and suspense, there are some serious logical holes that severely challenge your ability to suspend your disbelief. Furthermore, in true X-files tradition while some of the uncertainties in the series are resolved, many others are interjected, clearly laying the groundwork for a sequel.It all begins with a boy in Texas falling into a natural hole in the ground. He is initially uninjured, finding a skull and then being exposed to a deadly and ancient virus extraterrestrial in origin. When the firefighters respond and try to rescue him, they too are infected and the mysterious federal agents are brought in. The bodies are transported to a federal building and Scully and Mulder enter when there is a bomb threat at that location. Mulder discovers the bomb but is puzzled when he is ordered to leave the building by the bomb disposal expert. The viewer is baffled when the ""expert"" simply sits there until the bomb explodes.The virus infects humans and causes a violent alien to grow inside their body, much like the movies in the ""Alien(s)"" series. It is part of a plan by aliens to colonize the Earth and the mysterious Syndicate with the cigarette-smoking man is involved. This group will kill anyone, including a member of their group, in order to keep their secret safe. This points out the greatest logical flaw of the series and this movie. If the members of the mysterious Syndicate were willing to blow up public buildings in a major city and kill one of their own, why would they ever hesitate to kill Mulder?Other flaws include the power of the vaccine to destroy the entire facility in Antarctica, the mysterious space ship that rises from the ice and how Scully and Mulder manage to survive when marooned in Antarctica with little in the way of winter clothing and no food, water or means of shelter. Had there been more resolution of these flaws, the movie would have been stronger.Nevertheless, the tension and action are strong enough to overcome most of the power of the flaws, making this a movie that you can enjoy as long as you don't think too hard about the weaknesses.",4,The action and tension are stronger than the logical flaws,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,2147,"['story', 'great', 'deal', 'exciting', 'action', 'suspense', 'are', 'serious', 'logical', 'holes', 'severely', 'challenge', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'Furthermore', 'true', 'X-files', 'tradition', 'uncertainties', 'series', 'are', 'resolved', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'interjected', 'clearly', 'laying', 'groundwork', 'sequel.It', 'boy', 'Texas', 'falling', 'natural', 'hole', 'ground', 'initially', 'uninjured', 'finding', 'skull', 'then', 'being', 'exposed', 'deadly', 'ancient', 'virus', 'extraterrestrial', 'origin', 'When', 'firefighters', 'respond', 'try', 'rescue', 'too', 'are', 'infected', 'mysterious', 'federal', 'agents', 'are', 'brought', 'bodies', 'are', 'transported', 'federal', 'building', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'enter', 'when', 'bomb', 'threat', 'location', 'Mulder', 'bomb', 'puzzled', 'when', 'ordered', 'leave', 'building', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'expert', 'viewer', 'baffled', 'when', 'expert', 'simply', 'there', 'bomb', 'explodes.The', 'virus', 'infects', 'humans', 'violent', 'alien', 'grow', 'body', 'much', 'movies', 'Alien', 'series', 'part', 'plan', 'aliens', 'colonize', 'Earth', 'mysterious', 'Syndicate', 'cigarette-smoking', 'man', 'involved', 'group', 'will', 'kill', 'anyone', 'including', 'member', 'group', 'order', 'keep', 'secret', 'safe', 'out', 'greatest', 'logical', 'flaw', 'series', 'movie', 'members', 'mysterious', 'Syndicate', 'were', 'willing', 'blow', 'up', 'public', 'buildings', 'major', 'city', 'kill', 'one', 'own', 'why', 'would', 'ever', 'hesitate', 'kill', 'Mulder', 'Other', 'flaws', 'include', 'power', 'vaccine', 'destroy', 'entire', 'facility', 'Antarctica', 'mysterious', 'space', 'ship', 'ice', 'how', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'manage', 'survive', 'when', 'marooned', 'Antarctica', 'little', 'way', 'winter', 'clothing', 'food', 'water', 'means', 'shelter', 'Had', 'been', 'more', 'resolution', 'flaws', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'stronger.Nevertheless', 'tension', 'action', 'are', 'strong', 'enough', 'overcome', 'most', 'power', 'flaws', 'making', 'movie', 'can', 'enjoy', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'weaknesses']",N/A

451387,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6305142467,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","My very first episode of the show I saw was Avatar, a season 3 episode involving a character named Skinner. But I didn't catch the bug until season 4's ""Unruhe"" starring Pruitt ""buggy eyes"" Taylor Vince. Then me and my mom got heavily into it so the film is of course a big thing. While the show does provide some answers, it also in typical X-Files fashion presents a whole new host of them. Newbies will most likely be confused while X-Philes will love it completely or like it but have issues.Taking place between season 5 finale ""The End"" which saw The X-Files office being turned crispy by a fire and season 6 premiere ""The Beginning"", the film starts with a bombing in Dallas for which Mulder and Scully are blamed. Their investigation leads them to finding a huge corn crop in Texas with friendly bees and travelling to the land beside the land down under: Antarctica.One goal the filmmakers set was that you would get the story elements if you were a fan but if you weren't, the film would try to recap in a sense. So while longtime fans will remember Scully's leaving behind a career in medicine, we know that already, we actually smile as we see Mulder's sunflower seeds habit continuing. Certain characters return, others oddly are absent and one character's fate is surprising for longtime fans.Highlights are probably a little action scene involving corn crops and a really cool end scene where it takes place in Antarctica. This one shot in particular where um, ""something"" makes it first appearance outside is so cool I actually pressed my Instant Replay to see it again. For certain people it might get boring or slow in parts but most people won't even notice, such as me.Probably one of the biggest sexual tension filled relationship is Mulder and Scully. It of course helps both are good looking(being a guy I obviously gravitate towards Gillian Anderson) but it proves that casting wouldn't be a problem in the film. Even some new faces appear including Martin Landau, Blythe Danner(Gwyneth's mom FYI), Terry O'Quinn(Locke from Lost) and Armin Muehller-Stall.It's a film that definately needs a double-dip(odd I actually want that), the film's fairly bare bones, including a short EPK and a commentary(informative, but still that's it).

And now that I've at last made time to see it, guess what...it's still THAT BAD.To think, back in the late-`90's I spent months looking forward to this film. There was once a time, after all, when The X-Files was a big deal, and when I was in college, it was the one TV show no one ever seemed to miss. Instead of a project equal to my and so many others' eager  anticipation, we were ""treated"" to a movie that was terrible in every way. Filled with clich&eacute;s (please, why must every on-screen bomb have those little red numbers on the front counting down the time till detonation?), this movie made an even greater muddle of already muddled conspiracy theories that by then were starting to drag down one of the most suspenseful, intelligent, and altogether cool series in broadcast history.Although Fight The Future (yes the ""X-Files Movie"" actually had a name) promised to reveal all or at least much that we'd been squirming to know, this stinko actually backfired and showed that not only was the truth not out there, but The X-Files was actually a ship plowing haphazardly through choppy waters, no one at the wheel.As we left the theater, my friend said to me, ""They're just making this stuff up as they go, aren't they?""""Yep, Jackie,"" I replied, ""they are.""  (There, I used your name in a review.)And for the first time, ladies and gentlemen, the light of Heaven shone down onto New England, and we saw the Emperor was stark naked.Okay, kidding aside, I truly think the release of this film was when The X Files jumped the sharks and the beginning of the end to this once ice-hot TV show can be traced to this one goshawful motion picture.Why after so long do I still feel so much antipathy for a banal movie?

451399,A23GFTVIETX7DS,6305142467,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[28, 40]","For The X-Files aficionados, this movie is a must-see, not because of any wonderful cinematic magic but because of the coherence it adds to the complicated, spread out conspiracy theories that abound in the television series.  The feature length film acts like a bridge between season 5 and 6, with information contained in the movie used later in the series.  Although fans don't need to see the movie to understand later episodes, it adds to the enjoyment of them.Naturally, the plot is too complicated to fully describe without giving away spoilers, so let it suffice to say that a mysterious underground discovery in North Texas and a Oklahoma City style bombing in Dallas are linked in ways that shock even Mulder (David Duchovny).  Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Mulder are once again the FBI scapegoats who must prove their integrity to a panel of grim-faced investigators who are intent on closing down the X-files.  Many favorites make appearances -  Cigarette Smoking Man, the secret society of old white men, the Lone Gunmen, Skinner - with the addition of a new conspiracy informant played by Martin Landau.  Plot lines of alien viruses, Samantha Mulder's abduction, mysterious midnight shipments via trains, and government cover-ups dovetail in this convoluted yet strangely logical screenplay.  The worst part from a The X-Files fan is the rapid-fire exposition coming out of Scully and Mulder for those who have no background in the series.  For the uninitiated, the words come out too fast to grasp.  By far the coolest scene occurs near the end in a collapsing, snow covered terrain.Don't waste your time or money if you have only a marginal interest in The X-Files, as the film's interest comes from its relationship to the television episodes.  If you are a fan, you should see this since, even though it's not great cinema, it adds another dimension to what you've already seen.

451401,A3UW23DBF2KHWC,6305142467,Denis Vukosav,"[2, 2]","The X-Files made its debut on Fox Network back in 1993, introducing Fox Mulder (played by David Duchovny), the only agent in the X-Files division of the FBI, that takes care of unsolved paranormal cases, and his new partner, agent Dana Scully (played by Gillian Anderson) who is rational doctor secretly assigned to take care of Mulder. After successful first season The X-Files become probably the most popular show on television which besides series continuation inspired making of movie bearing the same name and had same characters. The producer and writer was also the same guy, Chris Carter, who is the man that this series most likely owes its success.The movie story begins in an icy cave, 30,000 years ago when two cavemen stumble across an alien creature and kill it although only survivor was attacked by the strange black blood from the alien. The action moves to present day north Texas, where four boys discover the same cavern with disastrous end and when firemen attempted a rescue, themselves are victimized as well. White trucks and military helicopter appear together with white biohazard suited men and took remaining survivors. Our familiar FBI agents Mulder and Scully would be drawn into a dangerous conspiracy, the strangest investigation they had ever participated. Together with assistance of a strange doctor, Mulder and Scully would risk their lives to pursue a deadly virus presumably extraterrestrial that could destroy all life on our planet. But their investigation will confront them to the mysterious organization, The Syndicate, very powerful men who without hesitation will do whatever needed to keep their secrets safe...This movie was made both for fans of series but as well for those who were not regulars, although the story may be a bit too hard for those who aren't experienced with the series. There is some good mix of conspiracy, mystery, thriller and action, with several comical scenes and some bit of romance between two main characters. Finally, the fans would tell...Fight the Future is made with much higher budget than the series, that is obvious, but it's also even more suspenseful and exciting than any episode - well-written and well-acted. This is the movie first DVD edition and it's lacking anamorphic transfer which can be found on following editions. Nevertheless, it has ""The X-Files"" distinctive shadow look emphasized by well-defined light sources. The 2.35:1 widescreen movie is of excellent picture quality, without digital artifacts or defects, with deep black levels especially during the night shots in the snow. The colors are good although this isn't a very colorful film.The THX mastered sound is presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround, with additional 2.0 French and English tracks. Excellent Mark Snow's score would not disturb your neighbors but it would create a perfect atmosphere of mystery, expectation and fear. There are some scenes with good surround effects but mostly the movie sound is centered on front speakers.Speaking about extras, you'll find the commentary with producer/writer Chris Carter and director Rob Bowman that could be very interesting for series fans with lot of details about the movie creation and comparison with the series. Additionally, you'll find a collector's card and three trailers, ending with thirty minutes documentary, which is basically combination of couple interviews with cast and crew. Not much to be honest and if you want something more you will need to buy DVD special edition, Blu-ray version from 2005 or The X-Files Movie 2-Pack that includes ""Fight the Future"" and its sequel ""I Want to Believe"".The X-Files movie was transferred well from big screen to DVD, although this first DVD edition is lacking more extras and anamorphic picture.Nevertheless, if you don't have Blu-ray device it's still worth to have this DVD in your collection.",4,"Nice transfer from big screen to DVD, although lacking more extras and anamorphic picture...",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",2013,3867,"['X-Files', 'made', 'debut', 'Fox', 'Network', 'back', '1993', 'introducing', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'played', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'only', 'agent', 'X-Files', 'division', 'FBI', 'care', 'unsolved', 'paranormal', 'cases', 'new', 'partner', 'agent', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'played', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'who', 'rational', 'doctor', 'secretly', 'assigned', 'take', 'care', 'Mulder', 'successful', 'first', 'season', 'X-Files', 'become', 'probably', 'most', 'popular', 'show', 'television', 'series', 'continuation', 'inspired', 'making', 'movie', 'bearing', 'same', 'name', 'had', 'same', 'characters', 'producer', 'writer', 'was', 'also', 'same', 'guy', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'who', 'man', 'series', 'most', 'likely', 'owes', 'success.The', 'movie', 'story', 'icy', 'cave', '30,000', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'two', 'cavemen', 'stumble', 'alien', 'creature', 'kill', 'only', 'survivor', 'was', 'attacked', 'strange', 'black', 'blood', 'alien', 'action', 'present', 'day', 'north', 'Texas', 'where', 'four', 'discover', 'same', 'cavern', 'disastrous', 'end', 'when', 'firemen', 'attempted', 'rescue', 'are', 'victimized', 'as', 'well', 'White', 'trucks', 'military', 'helicopter', 'appear', 'together', 'white', 'biohazard', 'suited', 'men', 'took', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'familiar', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'would', 'be', 'drawn', 'dangerous', 'conspiracy', 'strangest', 'investigation', 'had', 'ever', 'participated', 'Together', 'assistance', 'strange', 'doctor', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'would', 'risk', 'lives', 'pursue', 'deadly', 'virus', 'presumably', 'extraterrestrial', 'could', 'destroy', 'life', 'planet', 'investigation', 'will', 'confront', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'Syndicate', 'very', 'powerful', 'men', 'who', 'hesitation', 'will', 'do', 'needed', 'keep', 'secrets', 'safe', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'fans', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'regulars', 'story', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'experienced', 'series', 'good', 'mix', 'conspiracy', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'action', 'several', 'comical', 'scenes', 'bit', 'romance', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Finally', 'fans', 'would', 'tell', 'Fight', 'Future', 'made', 'much', 'higher', 'budget', 'series', 'obvious', 'also', 'even', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'episode', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'first', 'DVD', 'edition', 'lacking', 'anamorphic', 'transfer', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'following', 'editions', 'Nevertheless', 'X-Files', 'distinctive', 'shadow', 'look', 'emphasized', 'well-defined', 'light', 'sources', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'movie', 'excellent', 'picture', 'quality', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'defects', 'deep', 'black', 'levels', 'especially', 'night', 'shots', 'snow', 'colors', 'are', 'good', ""n't"", 'very', 'colorful', 'film.The', 'THX', 'mastered', 'sound', 'presented', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'surround', 'additional', '2.0', 'French', 'English', 'tracks', 'Excellent', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'score', 'would', 'not', 'disturb', 'neighbors', 'would', 'create', 'perfect', 'atmosphere', 'mystery', 'expectation', 'fear', 'are', 'scenes', 'good', 'surround', 'effects', 'mostly', 'movie', 'sound', 'centered', 'front', 'speakers.Speaking', 'extras', ""'ll"", 'find', 'commentary', 'producer/writer', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'director', 'Rob', 'Bowman', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'series', 'fans', 'lot', 'details', 'movie', 'creation', 'comparison', 'series', 'Additionally', ""'ll"", 'find', 'collector', 'card', 'three', 'trailers', 'ending', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'documentary', 'basically', 'combination', 'couple', 'interviews', 'cast', 'crew', 'Not', 'much', 'be', 'honest', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'will', 'need', 'buy', 'DVD', 'special', 'edition', 'Blu-ray', 'version', '2005', 'X-Files', 'Movie', '2-Pack', 'Fight', 'Future', 'sequel', 'Want', 'Believe', '.The', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'was', 'transferred', 'well', 'big', 'screen', 'DVD', 'first', 'DVD', 'edition', 'lacking', 'more', 'extras', 'anamorphic', 'picture.Nevertheless', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'device', 'still', 'worth', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection']",N/A

451404,A2198FZZMTJ38H,6305142467,D. Litton,"[5, 5]","&quot;The X-Files&quot; as a television show has never really held any interest for me. I have yet to see a single episode of the show, and I doubt I'll be starting soon. Which is why it was such a shock that, upon completing the movie version of the franchise, &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future,&quot; I found that I completely enjoyed it from beginning to end. It will come as a surprise that, even though it helps to have some knowledge of the characters and plot of the show, it is not fully needed to grasp the storyline the movie follows. It has a classical feel to it, one that encompasses sci-fi films of the past, while giving us a powerpunch of superb acting and lasting intensity.The movie begins in the B.C. era, in the area that will later be known as the state of Texas. Two primate-resembling figures are attacked by a strange creature in an underground cave. Moving ahead to the present day, a small child is inflicted with what appear to be black worms and is taken away to an unknown location, along with the bodies of two firemen who attempted to rescue him. Soon after, a building in Dallas, Texas, is bombed and destroyed, and special agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully discover that the bodies of the firemen and the boy were in the building when the bomb went off.Thinking this to be a coverup of something much more massive, Mulder and Scully begin going on an undercover hunt for significant clues as to the reasons for the deaths of the three deceased, and Scully concludes that what killed them consists of a new form of life that drains away the nutrients of the human body. Moreover, as they continue their explorations, under the watchful eye of several conspirators that have taken different sides, they find that there is a much larger coverup, one that holds the key to the destruction of all mankind and the beginning of a new species.There is not really a whole lot to say in opposition of the movie from my point of view. I'm sure a lot of the fans of the TV series will have their quibbles and problems with it, but for me, it was a satisfying movie that delivers all the goods a thriller should have and then some. The story unfolds at a slow and steady pace, which allows us to take in everything that's intrical to the plot. The story is also quite simple despite its complexity, which keeps it watchable for non-show fans as well. It begins with deaths, moves into the investigation, and becomes a cat-and-mouse thriller in which you have no idea who to trust, or what to think about the events at hand.What makes the story even better is that it does not focus solely on Mulder and Scully's quest, but also on the point of view of other important characters who play key roles. Those characters include Kurtzweil, who gives Mulder clues and hints as to the location of the bodies and events going on, and an unnamed man, whom we never know if we can trust or not during his onscreen time. Each person is introduced at different points in the movie, and some of them may lose their lives, but not before giving us, as an audience, all the information we need to keep up with the main characters' quest for the final answer to the puzzle.The movie has a surprisingly high suspense quotient, which remains somewhat subtle until the story picks up. There are the moments of building suspense, which lies in the scenes such as the one in which Mulder and Scully make a trip to Texas to search for evidence of a biological dig site where the virus was first discovered. And then we have our high-intensity action sequences, such as the one in which the two are being chased through a cornfield by helicopters, and final showdown in the Arctic as Mulder travels there to save his partner. This added intensity does a good job of keeping us involved with the movie, and also brings a high sense of the unknown to a movie whose plot is strictly that.The virus is the key centerpiece for the entire movie. While it does not tie everything together in the end, it leaves nothing unturned. First we have the beginning sequences, in which the alien in the beginning later comes back in the form of a virus that quickly infects its victims. Later comes the corn crops and bees, which are revealed to be a transportation system for that virus. This leaves us with certain questions, ones that involve the motives of the conspirators as to whether or not they are trying to expedite the virus or keep it from spreading. Some of the factors conflict, and the ending never really gives us all the answers we need, but it does achieve its goal of keeping the story moving.David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take their television roles and turn them into brilliance on the big screen. Duchovny is Mulder, who is stern in his beliefs, and never gives in once he receives a clue until he has fully checked it out. His determination is a key part in the unfolding of the story, as well as in keeping the story moving at a strong pace. Gillian Anderson is the major brains of the duo, using her scientific expertise to discover the nature of the viral infection and where it originated. Her clues are what take them all across the country, and Anderson plays out all of Scully's intelligence brilliantly and with incredible believability. These characters speak so fluidly and seriously about their opinions and findings that we have no reason to doubt them at all.&quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future,&quot; is surprisingly easy to watch, even if you have no background of the television show. It may prove to be a letdown for fans of the show, but those of us interested in a solid story with intensity and likeable characters that is easy to follow will be pleased with the movie's well-structured plot, character development and moments of high-speed intensity.",4,Intelligent and crafty!,984700800,"03 16, 2001",2001,5784,"['quot', 'X-Files', 'quot', 'television', 'show',

All the series regulars make an appearence, from the Lone Gunmen to the Cigarette-Smoking Man to Deputy Director Skinner.  And for newcomers, it may contain the clearest statement of the grand conspiracy that moved the show.As the movie opens, the discovery of a prehistoric virus leads to the destruction of a federal office building in Oklahoma City and then to a global hunt for the elusive members of a conspiracy dedicated to concealing a staggering truth, and to eliminating any threat to that conspiracy...Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is really set-up for another television season than a true resolution of the story line.

451413,A3IKBHODOTYYHM,6305142467,"fra7299 ""fra7299""","[0, 0]","The X Files Fight the Future has the same feel as an episode of the series. There are many of the characters that you would see in the series, such as the Cigarette Smoking Man and The Well-Manicured Man. The film begins with the X Files closed, and Mulder and Scully assigned to other work. However, events happens which pique Mulder's interest into reopening the X-Files, and from here he and Scully take measures to find evidence into this.The opening scene sets the stage for the film. In North Texas, in the year 15000 B.C., Neanderthals discover what appears to be an alien life form in a cave. A struggle ensues, and it appears as though the caveman has killed the alien. However, a black substance emits from the alien and runs up the body of the caveman. Years later, in present day, boys are playing around the same area when one of them discovers a human skull in the hole. The same black liquid comes up from the ground and goes up the boy's body; his friends, terrified, scamper off and try to locate help. When firemen come to rescue them, they suffer the same fate, and the hole is sealed, presumably to cover up evidence. The film shifts to Dallas, where Scully and Mulder are investigating a bomb threat atop a building downtown. The bomb explodes despite Mulder warning a bomb in time to save the building, and then Mulder learns that there is evidence someone wanted whatever was in the building destroyed. (Mulder later learns, from a paranoid doctor Kurtweil that those people in the building, including the boy, had already been dead before the bomb exploded, and that someone was trying to hide something). After being reprimanded during an investigation into the bombing, Scully seems intent on quitting, but it is Mulder who tries to convince her to continue on, his hunch being that all is not right, and that they need to keep going, trying to find the truth. Convincing her to accept his theories, Mulder investigates further, and comes across information from an informant that a virus may be spreading, creating a new extraterrestrial entity that the government is trying to cover up. Mulder goes to many extremes to try to find evidence that will finally prove his ideas correct; this takes Scully and Mulder to morgues, along highway roads, cornfields, mysterious buildings and even Antarctica. As probably expected, the plot does get a little convoluted at times and you will have to suspend some belief and maybe scratch your head, but most of the action is quite in line with the mood of the series, and I thought it worked well with the film.There is also great chemistry between Mulder, the theorist, and Scully, the realist. Most series don't make great transitions, but I think this one did. Some say the ending may be anticlimactic; I thought it was perfect, and could not have ended any other way. My biggest beef was that, after this film's release in 1999, they let this go so long with a sequel.  Why did it take ten years for them to come up with a follow-up movie, with all the momentum of the show killed?  I haven't seen the second episode, I Want to Believe, but I hear that it wasn't very good, so it seems that the wait wasn't quite worth the wait.Still, this episode is quite relevant to the series, and a great DVD to own for a price that is fairly cheap. Another great aspect of the film is that you can enjoy even if you weren't a regular viewer of the series. The disc also includes some extras, such as a making of documentary.",4,"""One man alone cannot fight the future""",1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,3484,"['X', 'Files', 'Fight', 'Future', 'same', 'feel', 'episode', 'series', 'are', 'many', 'characters', 'would', 'see', 'series', 'such', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'Well-Manicured', 'Man', 'film', 'X', 'Files', 'closed', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'assigned', 'other', 'work', 'However', 'events', 'pique', 'Mulder', 'interest', 'reopening', 'X-Files', 'here', 'Scully', 'take', 'measures', 'find', 'evidence', 'this.The', 'opening', 'scene', 'stage', 'film', 'North', 'Texas', 'year', '15000', 'B.C.', 'Neanderthals', 'discover', 'what', 'be', 'alien', 'life', 'form', 'cave', 'struggle', 'ensues', 'caveman', 'killed', 'alien', 'However', 'black', 'substance', 'emits', 'alien', 'up', 'body', 'caveman', 'Years', 'later', 'present', 'day', 'boys', 'are', 'playing', 'same', 'area', 'when', 'one', 'human', 'skull', 'hole', 'same', 'black', 'liquid', 'up', 'ground', 'up', 'boy', 'body', 'friends', 'terrified', 'scamper', 'off', 'try', 'locate', 'help', 'When', 'firemen', 'come', 'rescue', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'hole', 'sealed', 'presumably', 'cover', 'up', 'evidence', 'film', 'shifts', 'Dallas', 'where', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'are', 'investigating', 'bomb', 'threat', 'building', 'downtown', 'bomb', 'Mulder', 'warning', 'bomb', 'time', 'save', 'building', 'then', 'Mulder', 'evidence', 'someone', 'wanted', 'was', 'building', 'destroyed', 'Mulder', 'later', 'paranoid', 'doctor', 'Kurtweil', 'people', 'building', 'including', 'boy', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'dead', 'bomb', 'exploded', 'someone', 'was', 'trying', 'hide', 'something', 'being', 'reprimanded', 'investigation', 'bombing', 'Scully', 'intent', 'quitting', 'Mulder', 'who', 'convince', 'continue', 'hunch', 'being', 'not', 'right', 'need', 'keep', 'going', 'trying', 'find', 'truth', 'Convincing', 'accept', 'theories', 'Mulder', 'further', 'across', 'information', 'informant', 'virus', 'may', 'be', 'spreading', 'creating', 'new', 'extraterrestrial', 'entity', 'government', 'trying', 'cover', 'up', 'Mulder', 'many', 'extremes', 'try', 'find', 'evidence', 'will', 'finally', 'prove', 'ideas', 'correct', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'morgues', 'highway', 'roads', 'cornfields', 'mysterious', 'buildings', 'even', 'Antarctica', 'probably', 'expected', 'plot', 'get', 'little', 'convoluted', 'times', 'will', 'have', 'suspend', 'belief', 'maybe', 'scratch', 'head', 'most', 'action', 'quite', 'line', 'mood', 'series', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'film.There', 'also', 'great', 'chemistry', 'Mulder', 'theorist', 'Scully', 'realist', 'Most', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'great', 'transitions', 'think', 'one', 'did', 'say', 'ending', 'may', 'be', 'anticlimactic', 'thought', 'was', 'perfect', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'ended', 'other', 'way', 'biggest', 'beef', 'was', 'film', 'release', '1999', 'let', 'go', 'so', 'long', 'sequel', 'Why', 'did', 'take', 'ten', 'years', 'come', 'up', 'follow-up', 'movie', 'momentum', 'show', 'killed', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'second', 'episode', 'Want', 'Believe', 'hear', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'wait', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'worth', 'wait.Still', 'episode', 'quite', 'relevant', 'series', 'great', 'DVD', 'own', 'price', 'fairly', 'cheap', 'great', 'aspect', 'film', 'can', 'enjoy', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'regular', 'viewer', 'series', 'disc', 'also', 'extras', 'such', 'making', 'documentary']",N/A

I've always had a soft spot (my fontanel, most likely) for the paranormal, though, so the show's premise always intrigued me. So when I saw the VHS of what I thought were episodes of the TV show for $1 at the Goodwill, I splurged.Alas, it turns out that I bought the X-Files movie made in 1998. As someone who did not watch the show, I cannot comment on how the movie fits into the whole X-Files universe; I am stuck commenting on it solely as a movie in the SF and/or horror genres.Some aspects of the film were good. Mulder and Scully were great together, and I am sure that the complementarity of their characters (as a paranormal ""Odd Couple"" of sorts) was one of the reasons the TV show was so successful. Casting Academy Award-winner Martin Landau as the conspiracy writer and ""kook"" Kurzweil was an inspired choice, given his ability to convey grave sentiments while still being somehow light-handed about it.Overall the film was disappointing, though. Again, maybe it is because I did not follow the TV series, but the plot here seemed simultaneously slapdash and derivative. When I say that  it was slapdash, I refer to its significant continuity and plot problems. Why was there an Oklahoma City-like bombing to get at five infected corpses? How in the heck did Mulder make it from the US out into the heart of an Antarctic icefield in 48 hours? How did he and Scully make it home from Antarctica? Where did Scully get the footwear in Antarctica (she has bare feet in one scene, and is walking on Antarctic ice in the next)? These are just a few examples of the badly thought-out plot that afflicts this film.Even this would forgivable if so much in the movie were not painfully derivative. Extraterrestrials gestating inside human beings and bursting out when they mature definitely sounds familiar. I forget where I saw it before, but the movie had something to do with aliens, I think. The Landau character, while played brilliantly, is far too similar to Donald Sutherland's character in JFK; he knows everything, but how? He is always stalking in the shadows where Mulder can find him while eluding the rest of the nation's intelligence community? Come on. Sadly, if the truth really is out there, the screenwriters probably cribbed it from an earlier film.Die-hard fans of the TV show might like this film, but for the casual SF and horror fan, it is definitely passable.",2,"It gave me every penny's worth, but it cost me a dollar first",1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,2496,"['gave', 'up', 'watching', 'cable', 'TV', 'early', '90s', 'so', 'missed', 'most', 'X-Files', 'original', 'incarnation', ""'ve"", 'always', 'had', 'soft', 'spot', 'fontanel', 'most', 'likely', 'paranormal', 'though', 'show', 'premise', 'always', 'intrigued', 'when', 'saw', 'VHS', 'what', 'thought', 'were', 'episodes', 'TV', 'show', '1', 'Goodwill', 'splurged.Alas', 'out', 'bought', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'made', '1998', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'show', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'how', 'movie', 'whole', 'X-Files', 'universe', 'am', 'stuck', 'commenting', 'solely', 'movie', 'SF', 'and/or', 'horror', 'genres.Some', 'aspects', 'film', 'were', 'good', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'were', 'great', 'together', 'am', 'sure', 'complementarity', 'characters', 'paranormal', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'sorts', 'was', 'one', 'reasons', 'TV', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'successful', 'Casting', 'Academy', 'Award-winner', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'conspiracy', 'writer', 'kook', 'Kurzweil', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'given', 'ability', 'convey', 'grave', 'sentiments', 'still', 'being', 'somehow', 'light-handed', 'film', 'was', 'disappointing', 'though', 'Again', 'maybe', 'did', 'not', 'follow', 'TV', 'series', 'plot', 'here', 'seemed', 'simultaneously', 'slapdash', 'derivative', 'When', 'say', 'was', 'slapdash', 'refer', 'significant', 'continuity', 'plot', 'problems', 'Why', 'was', 'Oklahoma', 'City-like', 'bombing', 'get', 'five', 'infected', 'corpses', 'How', 'heck', 'did', 'Mulder', 'make', 'US', 'out', 'heart', 'Antarctic', 'icefield', '48', 'hours', 'How', 'did', 'Scully', 'make', 'home', 'Antarctica', 'Where', 'did', 'Scully', 'get', 'footwear', 'Antarctica', 'bare', 'feet', 'one', 'scene', 'walking', 'Antarctic', 'ice', 'next', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'examples', 'badly', 'thought-out', 'plot', 'film.Even', 'would', 'forgivable', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'were', 'not', 'painfully', 'derivative', 'Extraterrestrials', 'gestating', 'human', 'beings', 'bursting', 'out', 'when', 'mature', 'definitely', 'familiar', 'forget', 'where', 'saw', 'movie', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'aliens', 'think', 'Landau', 'character', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'far', 'too', 'similar', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'character', 'JFK', 'everything', 'how', 'always', 'stalking', 'shadows', 'where', 'Mulder', 'can', 'find', 'eluding', 'rest', 'nation', 'intelligence', 'community', 'Come', 'Sadly', 'truth', 'really', 'there', 'screenwriters', 'probably', 'cribbed', 'earlier', 'film.Die-hard', 'fans', 'TV', 'show', 'might', 'like', 'film', 'casual', 'SF', 'horror', 'fan', 'definitely', 'passable']",N/A

The show would hint at a lot, but it seemed very little would actually happen, and instead each show would just tease us a little more.The reason I decided to watch the movie was because I thought that the movie would probably be designed for a wider audience, have a self-contained story, and lots more excitement and special effects than the TV show.Well, kind of. There were more explosions and the special effects were a bit more snazzy. And it was very easy to jump right into it and pick up the story without much knowledge of the TV show. But, in typical X-files fashion, it teased a lot more than it delivered, and the ending was very unsatisfying.To be fair, I realize this was intentional on the film maker's part. And in the director's commentary, the director repeatedly bragged about leaving things vague in order to make them scarier to the imagination.

But that was three years ago and I was only a minor X Files fan at the time.Now, however, I own the first four seasons on DVD and have the Nitpickers Guide for X-Philes by my side as I watch each episode.So I figured it was time to go back to give Fight the Future another try.Okay, it was better this time. But only because I am now a bona fide X-Phile. If I was still a marginal fan, or someone who didn't know much at all about The X Files, the movie would still bore me to tears.Let's face it, gang, this movie could have been far better. Look at the facts:1. The big screen and the unlimited possibilities for it.2. All the show's top stars reprising their roles.3. Chris Carter.4. Additional movie stars (such as the always interesting Martin Landau) along for the ride.Yet...I thought there were more thrills and chills in a few classic episodes of the TV show than I found in this entire movie! Frankly, Fight the Future was like watching an extended episode of the TV show -- with only an occasional cuss word thrown in to prove that it wasn't television.As I said, I enjoyed watching the movie this time because I've come to know and like Scully and Mulder. I think David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson make a great team. Plus, now I understand who the Lone Gunmen are. And I can see that Skinner has a little decency inside of himself after all (in spite of his hardass exterior).In other words I Get It. I'm with ya, Chris.But the first X Files movie just never reached the level it could have. All the stops weren't pulled out. I think everyone was still thinking &quot;small screen&quot; when they should have been thinking &quot;SILVER SCREEN!&quot;.For the next X Files movie (and I hear one is being considered), why not try thinking TOTALLY outside of the box -- the TV box, that is.Blow us away next time!And, while you're at it, bring back David Duchovny.

Although I think that people who never watch the show can enjoy this movie, I doubt they can understand it very well.  Heck, I watch the show religiously and I still don't think I understand everything.However, it succeeds in introducing the audience to the characters of Agents Mulder and Scully, without rehashing the things that are familiar to the fans of the show.  When we are first introduced to our favorite duo, their conversation on their cell phones is enjoyable to both old audiences and new ones alike.The film also makes clear the deep affection and love Mulder and Scully feel for each other--something regular viewers already know--which comes to a head in the famous hallway scene outside of Mulder's apartment.The film is top quality, as we've come to expect no less from &quot;The X-Files,&quot; with an intelligent story-line, great action sequences and special effects, and plenty of aliens to satisfy the sci-fi junkie in all of us.  But don't get me wrong--you don't have to be a sci-fi junkie to enjoy this film.  You have to like a good suspense/thriller, with some action, intelligent story-telling, and yes, a little bit of hinted-at romance.  I mean, for &quot;The X-Files,&quot; any 'Shipper will tell you that this is a pretty romantic movie.  As one of those so-called 'Shippers, I was very angry at that darn bee, which was my biggest disappointment.The DVD itself is nicely presented, with all the theatrical trailers, an informative commentary track by Rob Bowman and Chris Carter, and an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film.

I was as pleased with this first film as I was unhappy with the second. This first movie was fast paced and left the viewer no time to look back. To be honest, the story was over and neatly resolved before I knew it and there wasn't a second to be spared.The film flowed beautifully from the TV series to the big screen and from one scene to the next, and every special effects shot was breathtaking. I especially enjoyed the final scenes which presented Scully's rescue by Mulder and their narrow escape from a huge alien spacecraft.  These grand scenes made the long running X-Files story larger than life, adding new dimension to the series. This X-Files movie delivered on every possible level and was extremely well thought out and executed, and was one of Chris Carter's best productions ever!I saw this film in a very good big screen movie theater when it opened and it made for an excellent viewing experience. Chris Carter could not have done a better job of recruiting new viewers with this film which was a wonderful showcase for the look, color, flavor and wonderful mood of the X-Files.  If only he could have done something nearly as good in the recent X-Files 2 (I want to believe).",5,THE X-FILES (Fight the Future) - Great!,1237680000,"03 22, 2009",2009,1301,"['X-FILES', 'Fight', 'Future', 'was', 'great', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'loyal', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'non-viewers', 'was', 'pleased', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'unhappy', 'second', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'fast', 'paced', 'left', 'viewer', 'time', 'look', 'back', 'be', 'honest', 'story', 'was', 'neatly', 'resolved', 'knew', 'was', ""n't"", 'second', 'be', 'spared.The', 'film', 'flowed', 'beautifully', 'TV', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'special', 'effects', 'shot', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'scenes', 'presented', 'Scully', 'rescue', 'Mulder', 'narrow', 'escape', 'huge', 'alien', 'spacecraft', 'grand', 'scenes', 'made', 'long', 'running', 'X-Files', 'story', 'larger', 'life', 'adding', 'new', 'dimension', 'series', 'X-Files', 'movie', 'delivered', 'possible', 'level', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'executed', 'was', 'one', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'best', 'productions', 'ever', 'saw', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'big', 'screen', 'movie', 'theater', 'when', 'opened', 'made', 'excellent', 'viewing', 'experience', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'job', 'recruiting', 'new', 'viewers', 'film', 'was', 'wonderful', 'showcase', 'look', 'color', 'flavor', 'wonderful', 'mood', 'X-Files', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'recent', 'X-Files', '2', 'want', 'believe']",N/A

Though I enjoyed the original series, I was never a fanatic about it.  In fact, when this film originally came out, I had no intentions of seeing it.  Now that I finally have, I must admit that it is pretty good.  It's full of cameos and tie-ins from the TV series that even a casual fan such as myself can pick up on, but you need not watch any of the series' episodes to enjoy this film.This movie really plays out like an extended TV episode with just tad better special effects.  But, much like the series, this movie relies on the strength of the plot to peak the interest of the viewer.As in the series, there is a giant government cover-up going on.  Fox and Scully are hot on the trail(as usual), and break a few rules along the way in order to gather information.  There are leaks, men in black, men in HAZMAT suits, and unexplained, strange events.  I can't say much more than that or I'll spoil the show.  Just know that little green men are on the move and Fox and Scully are trying to stop them.The acting is superb, and the banter between Mulder and Scully is tight and witty as it ever was on the TV show.  David Duchovny is comfortable in his role as the quirky, paranoid, and probably a little bit crazy Mulder.  Gillian Anderson, whom I consider business-suit beautiful, gives another flawless performance as Scully.  Martin Landau also makes an appearance as well as an abundance of recurring characters from the TV show.Odds are that if you enjoyed the series, you'll enjoy this film.  It does begin to drag a bit about 110 minutes into the flick, but the ending picks things up and gets somewhat suspenseful.  If you aren't familiar with the show, rest assured that you won't be anymore lost during the film than TV regulars and the characters in the movie.Recommended to those who like sci-fi with a little bit of brains thrown in and anyone who loves a good mystery.Potential Spoiler!!!!This film becomes rather timely with the mention of a certain government group that appears to be the major catalyst for most of the conspiracy in this film.  If you have heard of those two hurricanes that recently whipped up on the Gulf coast from Alabama to Texas(including my home of southwest Louisiana), you know which government group I'm talking about........",4,Much Better Than Expected,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,2384,"['X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', 'first', 'attempt', 'transferring', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'big', 'screen', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'fanatic', 'fact', 'when', 'film', 'originally', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'intentions', 'seeing', 'Now', 'finally', 'have', 'must', 'admit', 'pretty', 'good', 'full', 'cameos', 'tie-ins', 'TV', 'series', 'even', 'casual', 'fan', 'such', 'can', 'pick', 'up', 'need', 'not', 'watch', 'series', 'episodes', 'enjoy', 'film.This', 'movie', 'really', 'out', 'extended', 'TV', 'episode', 'just', 'tad', 'better', 'special', 'effects', 'much', 'series', 'movie', 'strength', 'plot', 'peak', 'interest', 'viewer.As', 'series', 'giant', 'government', 'cover-up', 'going', 'Fox', 'Scully', 'are', 'hot', 'trail', 'usual', 'break', 'few', 'rules', 'way', 'order', 'gather', 'information', 'are', 'leaks', 'men', 'black', 'men', 'HAZMAT', 'suits', 'unexplained', 'strange', 'events', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', ""'ll"", 'spoil', 'show', 'Just', 'know', 'little', 'green', 'men', 'are', 'move', 'Fox', 'Scully', 'are', 'trying', 'stop', 'them.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'banter', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'tight', 'witty', 'ever', 'was', 'TV', 'show', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'comfortable', 'role', 'quirky', 'paranoid', 'probably', 'little', 'bit', 'crazy', 'Mulder', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'whom', 'consider', 'business-suit', 'beautiful', 'flawless', 'performance', 'Scully', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'also', 'appearance', 'as', 'well', 'abundance', 'recurring', 'characters', 'TV', 'show.Odds', 'are', 'enjoyed', 'series', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'begin', 'drag', 'bit', '110', 'minutes', 'flick', 'ending', 'picks', 'things', 'up', 'somewhat', 'suspenseful', 'are', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'show', 'rest', 'assured', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'anymore', 'lost', 'film', 'TV', 'regulars', 'characters', 'movie.Recommended', 'who', 'sci-fi', 'little', 'bit', 'brains', 'thrown', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'mystery.Potential', 'Spoiler', 'film', 'rather', 'timely', 'mention', 'certain', 'government', 'group', 'be', 'major', 'catalyst', 'most', 'conspiracy', 'film', 'have', 'heard', 'two', 'hurricanes', 'recently', 'whipped', 'up', 'Gulf', 'coast', 'Alabama', 'Texas', 'including', 'home', 'southwest', 'Louisiana', 'know', 'government', 'group', ""'m"", 'talking', '..']",N/A

On the silver screen; The X-Files, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are in every way movie stars and the genre in this format are visually stunning.  Chris Carters genius shines through as this film was made prior to shooting the fifth season of the episode and therefore they had to design the entire fifth season around the film.  In no uncertain terms, Chris Carter and the other producers of the series proved that they could exceed even their own high standards and take the genre to the silver screen.  The only real question is, now that the series is over after nine years, are or when are they going to film a second movie?The premise:  MINOR SPOILERSAt the conclusion of the fifth season, The X-Files have been closed as those who have been conspiring with the alien forces have desired to do, since Mulder and Scully were getting a little too close to their flame.The movie opens with a stunning scene taking the viewers back thirty five thousand years where we witness an encounter between cavemen and an alien.  We're then taken to the present day where Mulder and Scully are in Dallas, TX.  The X-Files are closed and they're working as normal agents, searching for a bomb on a hot Texas day.  Unfortunately for them, although Mulder discovers the location of the bomb, it still goes off, killing a senior agent and supposedly three other people in the building.  This leads to the FBI needing scapegoats and directing the separation of Mulder and Scully.  Of course, Mulder can't sit still for this and in the only way he and Scully know how, they begin to uncover the conspirators' plots.What follows is simply a silver screen masterpiece as we are finally, after five wonderful years of questions, given some answers.  Unfortunately along with these long awaited answers we find that there are more questions.  As the producers of the show have stated all along, they've been making television movies all along and were ready for the big screen, so right they were.Exceptional performances by David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, William B. Davis and Mitch Pileggi.  Nods to Chris Carter and director Rob Bowman for casting Martin Landau.

Scully and Mulder ona case in Dallas, Texas looking for a bomb hidden in the federalbuilding there. The bomb, planted by agents of the evil FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), to destroy evidence of a kid and a few fireman who were infect by an alien virus. Right, let's be subtle about this, shall we? Let's not steal the bodies and destroy them, oh no, let's plant explosives in a very large and obvious fashion and nuke a building in a large metropolitan center. Good thinking, guys!There is no doubt a lot here for an X-Files fan, of which I would count myself one. It is an intelligent show to some degree, but after seven years of Scully being skeptical and Mulder being obsessive is getting a little redundant. What does work in the movie and has always worked in the TV series is the fact that Mulder and Scully are important to each other - more than just colleagues, more than just friends, but still not going to fall in love with each other - having them do so would be the same killing blow that sunk Moonlighting back in the eighties. The chemistry between the two is probably what keeps me coming back to the show.The movie does reveal some secrets, most of which are kept away from Scully even though she was there for most of it. Drugged unconscious and infected with the alien virus, Scully is captured and placed aboard an alien ship hidden in Antarctica and must be rescued by Mulder, (is anyone getting tired of Scully always being the victim? I know I am). Yes, there are real aliens and yes there is a conspiracy to cover them up while some very powerful men consort with them in order to save their own skins. But apparently the aliens are the native inhabitants to Earth and now want it back.I don't think this should have been a movie, but rather a two-parter or a season ender/opener for the series. It didn't reveal as much as the advertisements said it would, and unfortunately the truth is still out there. And now that Duchovny's contract has expired, he has shown no interest in resigning to the show, and I don't really blame him. The media hype and the drooling fangirls would be enough to turn anyone off that kind of exposure. There have been rumors of second film called X-Files: Invasion, but not much has been revealed. If it does happen and it is made, let's just hope it has a lot more meat on it than the first film did.",3,"A Good Two-Hour Episode, But Didn't Need To be a Movie",961718400,"06 23, 2000",2000,2409,"['really', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'ona', 'case', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'looking', 'bomb', 'hidden', 'federalbuilding', 'there', 'bomb', 'planted', 'agents', 'evil', 'FEMA', 'Federal', 'Emergency', 'Management', 'Agency', 'destroy', 'evidence', 'kid', 'few', 'fireman', 'who', 'were', 'infect', 'alien', 'virus', 'Right', 'let', 'be', 'subtle', 'shall', 'Let', 'not', 'steal', 'bodies', 'destroy', 'let', 'plant', 'very', 'large', 'obvious', 'fashion', 'nuke', 'building', 'large', 'metropolitan', 'center', 'Good', 'thinking', 'guys', 'doubt', 'lot', 'here', 'X-Files', 'fan', 'would', 'count', 'one', 'intelligent', 'show', 'degree', 'seven', 'years', 'Scully', 'being', 'skeptical', 'Mulder', 'being', 'obsessive', 'getting', 'little', 'redundant', 'What', 'work', 'movie', 'always', 'worked', 'TV', 'series', 'fact', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'important', 'other', 'more', 'just', 'colleagues', 'more', 'just', 'friends', 'still', 'not', 'going', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'having', 'do', 'so', 'would', 'be', 'same', 'killing', 'blow', 'sunk', 'Moonlighting', 'back', 'eighties', 'chemistry', 'two', 'probably', 'what', 'coming', 'back', 'show.The', 'movie', 'reveal', 'secrets', 'most', 'are', 'kept', 'away', 'Scully', 'even', 'was', 'there', 'most', 'Drugged', 'unconscious', 'infected', 'alien', 'virus', 'Scully', 'captured', 'placed', 'alien', 'ship', 'hidden', 'Antarctica', 'must', 'be', 'rescued', 'Mulder', 'anyone', 'getting', 'tired', 'Scully', 'always', 'being', 'victim', 'know', 'am', 'Yes', 'are', 'real', 'aliens', 'yes', 'conspiracy', 'cover', 'up', 'very', 'powerful', 'men', 'consort', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'skins', 'apparently', 'aliens', 'are', 'native', 'inhabitants', 'Earth', 'now', 'want', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'rather', 'two-parter', 'season', 'ender/opener', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'as', 'much', 'advertisements', 'said', 'would', 'unfortunately', 'truth', 'still', 'there', 'now', 'Duchovny', 'contract', 'expired', 'shown', 'interest', 'resigning', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'blame', 'media', 'hype', 'drooling', 'fangirls', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'turn', 'anyone', 'kind', 'exposure', 'have', 'been', 'rumors', 'second', 'film', 'called', 'X-Files', 'Invasion', 'not', 'much', 'been', 'revealed', 'happen', 'made', 'let', 'just', 'hope', 'lot', 'more', 'meat', 'first', 'film', 'did']",N/A

451481,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305142467,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","I might get in trouble with ""X Files"" fanatics in this review. Lucky for me, you only know my Email address. I sound as paranoid as Scully and Mulder.There were raging debates over the merits of the movie version of the long running Fox network series. Fans of the show seemed to be divided between those who thought it was a spectacular picture and those who thought it somehow betrayed the spirit of the series. People who had not watched it on TV came out of theaters either mesmerized or clueless.I think I know the reason for all the emotional reactions. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a film has been made based on a network series that is still in production. ...I personally have watched maybe five episodes of ""The X Files"", partly because I lead a life which has no routine schedule. My eccentric life aside, I found it to be less original than ""Twin Peaks"", which was also about an FBI agent dealing with things most mysterious. It also did not have the divine humor of the bizarre ""Northern Exposure"", which isn't science fiction, but does seem to describe life on another planet.It is obvious to me that, had the movie been made after the series had finished production, it might have been great. As it is, the creators could not develop a plot that gave too much away, since that would have damaged the current season. If the flick had been an original idea, it would have ranked somewhere in-between ""Independence Day"" and ""Total Recall"".I understood the movie well enough. I also have enough awareness of the series to find Scully's always doubting Mulder to be getting rather tiresome. If she hasn't clued in by now, then she's not cut out to be a detective. I kept thinking she'd be better off going to medical school, as she always threatens to do.The climax of the film takes place in Antarctica. Mulder is wearing a Walmart parka and gloves which he takes off a few minutes after his arrival. As someone pointed out to me, in the movie's seasonal timeframe, it would be about seventy degrees below zero there. But then, this is yet another sci-fi story where the fate of the entire human race is in the hands of one man. So I suppose we are lucky he didn't die of frostbite.To ""The X Files"" credit, they are having a devil of a time defeating the aliens. This is refreshing.

Ooops.  As many reviewers have so adroitly noted, if you're not a fan of the series, you probably won't get a lot out of this film.  While expertly done, FIGHT THE FUTURE has a lot of elements that one cannot fully appreciate if one wasn't involved in the series.  And that makes me wonder, what was the point of making a movie if only fans of the series could truly appreciate it?  Why didn't they just make a two hour t.v. movie?  Obviously, they were hoping to expand their market with this big screen version, but as box office receipts proved, the film did not make the beaucoups of money the producers had hoped to.  Nor did it make movie stars out of David Duchovny or Gillian Anderson.  I will admit however that the movie is not the least bit boring, just confusing.  The performances are professional and noteworthy, the music is neat, and it moves at a very intense pace.  However, for the simple movie goer and those who did not follow the series after this movie was released, it left a lot of open territory to explore.

451485,A2VGKGXSG81KAS,6305142467,Michael J. Berquist,"[3, 7]","Those who haven't seen the show before will find this movie to be totally confusing. Even X-philes will be perplexed about what the deal is. I became a fan of the show for many reasons- series creator Chris Carter's  unorthodox takes on society &amp; myth, the acting of David Duchovney and  Gillian Anderson, and the show's quirky humor. This movie really doesn't  showcase any of those things.For the movie Carter wrote a decent story  which never really breaks free from its moorings. The potential scope and  grandeur of the story is hinted at but never seen. While the directing is  decidedly second-rate, the music is quite good- appropriately dark and  moody. Anderson &amp; Duchovney make what they can of Agents Mulder &amp;  Scully, but the story too often leaves the Agents reacting to events more  than acting upon them.The supporting cast is badly under-served as well.  While Martin Landau has some nice scenes as Mulder's latest informant, the  Lone Gunmen have little more than a cameo. Cigarette-Smoking Man &amp;  Skinner (both complex characters important to the show) are both left with  small parts that are hardly relevant to the story. John Neville's  Well-Manicured Man may have the best role in the movie as the man who  brings Mulder closer to the truth than he has ever been.Based on this  film, Fox's strategy of bringing the show onto the big screen seems fated  to failure.Carter would do well to turn the screenwriting duties for his  next film over to X-Files scribe Vince Gillighan or even Duchovney, a  talented writer himself.",2,Not bad.

451487,A16EZ4MT9BFF2R,6305142467,Mike Murray,"[26, 27]","I wouldn't pretend to be one who regularly watches the television series on which this film is based.  However, I've often watched and have always  marveled at how life is played out in the head of creator Chris Carter.  To  base a motion picture on a television series, you have to give a regular  viewer more than you would normally and yet still make the movie  comprehensible to the viewer of happenstance.  I think Mr. Carter  succeeded.The movie opens in the past.  Quite a ways past, in fact.  30,000 B.C. in a place we now know as North Texas.  At this point in time,  North Texas is a cold and barren place but something happens which sets the  stage for what is about to come.After this incident, we move to  &quot;present-day&quot; Dallas, Texas where the FBI is investigating a  terrorist bomb threat in the Federal Building.  We shortly meet our two  heroes, agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and agent Dana Scully (Gillian  Anderson).  In short order, we're told that the X-Files have been closed  but that Mulder and Scully are still partnered.  Scully is somewhat  exasperated because her partner is again being unorthodox and searching  another building across the street from the one the rest of the Bureau is  searching.  Finding nothing, Scully and Mulder prepare to leave the  building when Mulder decides to buy a soda from a nearby vending machine.  Instead, what he finds is the vending machine unplugged and a bomb -- a  very big bomb -- inside it.  And Mulder is locked in the room with it.  This being the 90s, Mulder calls Scully on his cellular phone and she  arranges to have the building cleared and the FBI team brought to the  building to get Mulder out and defuse the bomb.  One part of the plan  works.This is brilliant screenwriting because once you accept that agent  Mulder is a tad unorthodox and has an uncanny knack for stumbling into the  truth, it's completely believable to believe a scenario that would have a  terrorist call in a threat to one building and blow up a different one.  The resulting explosion evokes memories of the Oklahoma City bombing quite  chillingly.  However, instead of Scully and Mulder being hailed as heroes,  they're hauled in front of an inquiry to explain why five people died  instead of the countless number that would have died had the bomb not been  discovered.As Mr. Carter points out in a short &quot;Making Of...&quot;  presentation before the movie begins, the truth is not always the truth and  things are not always as they seem.  The Dallas bombing sets off a chain  of events which takes us not only through the Southwest, but to England,  Antarctica, and Tunisia.This really is an excellent piece of filmmaking  and there's lots of credit to go around.  First, there's a solid, finely  nuanced  story by creator/screenwriter Carter and collaborator Frank  Spotnitz.  This is a piece of work that stands completely on its own.  You  don't have to be a fan of the television series to enjoy the film; however,  the movie is almost completely consistent with the series and fits like a  puzzle piece with it.  The acting is really quite superb.  David Duchovny  and Gillian Anderson are fresh and lively in their portrayals of Mulder and  Scully.  There is a guest appearance by Martin Landau as a conspiracy  theorist doctor who, in shadowy fashion, guides Mulder toward the truth.  Blythe Danner appears as the chief investigator of an inquiry where the  outcome seems already determined.  Series regulars are much in evidence as  well.  Mitch Pileggi as Assistant Director Walter Skinner and, especially,  William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man keep the action moving  throughout the film.Regardless of whether you're a fan of the series or  not, this film will make a fine evening's entertainment.[Originally  written 18 October 1998]",4,Fight The Powers That Be,967852800,"09 2, 2000",2000,3829,"['would', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'regularly', 'television', 'series', 'film', 'based', 'However', ""'ve"", 'often', 'watched', 'have', 'always', 'marveled', 'how', 'life', 'played', 'out', 'head', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'base', 'motion', 'picture', 'television', 'series', 'have', 'give', 'regular', 'viewer', 'more', 'would', 'normally', 'yet', 'still', 'make', 'movie', 'comprehensible', 'viewer', 'happenstance', 'think', 'Mr.', 'Carter', 'succeeded.The', 'movie', 'opens', 'past', 'ways', 'past', 'fact', '30,000', 'B.C', 'place', 'now', 'know', 'North', 'Texas', 'point', 'time', 'North', 'Texas', 'cold', 'barren', 'place', 'something', 'happens', 'sets', 'stage', 'what', 'about', 'come.After', 'incident', 'move', 'quot', 'present-day', 'quot', 'Dallas', 'Texas', 'where', 'FBI', 'investigating', 'terrorist', 'bomb', 'threat', 'Federal', 'Building', 'shortly', 'meet', 'two', 'heroes', 'agent', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'agent', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'short', 'order', ""'re"", 'told', 'X-Files', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'still', 'partnered', 'Scully', 'somewhat', 'exasperated', 'partner', 'again', 'being', 'unorthodox', 'searching', 'building', 'street', 'one', 'rest', 'Bureau', 'searching', 'Finding', 'nothing', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'prepare', 'leave', 'building', 'when', 'Mulder', 'buy', 'soda', 'nearby', 'vending', 'machine', 'Instead', 'what', 'vending', 'machine', 'unplugged', 'bomb', 'very', 'big', 'bomb', 'Mulder', 'locked', 'room', 'being', '90s', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'cellular', 'phone', 'have', 'building', 'cleared', 'FBI', 'team', 'brought', 'building', 'get', 'Mulder', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'One', 'part', 'plan', 'works.This', 'brilliant', 'screenwriting', 'once', 'accept', 'agent', 'Mulder', 'tad', 'unorthodox', 'uncanny', 'knack', 'stumbling', 'truth', 'completely', 'believable', 'believe', 'scenario', 'would', 'have', 'terrorist', 'call', 'threat', 'one', 'building', 'blow', 'up', 'different', 'one', 'resulting', 'explosion', 'evokes', 'memories', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'bombing', 'quite', 'chillingly', 'However', 'instead', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'being', 'hailed', 'heroes', ""'re"", 'hauled', 'front', 'inquiry', 'explain', 'why', 'five', 'people', 'died', 'instead', 'countless', 'number', 'would', 'have', 'died', 'had', 'bomb', 'not', 'been', 'discovered.As', 'Mr.', 'Carter', 'out', 'short', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'presentation', 'movie', 'truth', 'not', 'always', 'truth', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'always', 'seem', 'Dallas', 'bombing', 'sets', 'off', 'chain', 'events', 'not', 'only', 'Southwest', 'England', 'Antarctica', 'Tunisia.This', 'really', 'excellent', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'lots', 'credit', 'go', 'around', 'First', 'solid', 'finely', 'nuanced', 'story', 'creator/screenwriter', 'Carter', 'collaborator', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz', 'piece', 'work', 'completely', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'television', 'series', 'enjoy', 'film', 'however', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'consistent', 'series', 'fits', 'puzzle', 'piece', 'acting', 'really', 'quite', 'superb', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'are', 'fresh', 'lively', 'portrayals', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'guest', 'appearance', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'doctor', 'who', 'shadowy', 'fashion', 'guides', 'Mulder', 'truth', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'chief', 'investigator', 'inquiry', 'where', 'outcome', 'already', 'determined', 'Series', 'regulars', 'are', 'much', 'evidence', 'as', 'well', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'Walter', 'Skinner', 'especially', 'William', 'B.', 'Davis', 'Cigarette-Smoking', 'Man', 'keep', 'action', 'moving', 'film.Regardless', ""'re"", 'fan', 'series', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'make', 'fine', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'Originally', 'written', '18', 'October', '1998', ']']",N/A
451488,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,6305142467,Mitch Weaver,"[10, 10]","The X-Files &quot;Fight the Future&quot; takes place after the end of season five when the X-Files have been shut down. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson) are assigned to a Federal building in Dallas to locate a bomb. Unfortunately, the bomb goes off before it can be defused, and an FBI agent as well as three fireman and a boy are killed in the explosion. The FBI needs someone to blame for what happened and look to Mulder and Scully. Wanting to find out what really happened to save their careers, Mulder starts searching for clues. He soon encounters a paranoid doctor ( Martin Landau) who reveals to Mulder a conspiracy dealing with a deadly virus that could be alien in origin - and capable of destroying all life on earth. Mulder and Scully are soon forced to put their careers and lives on the line, when they are pitted against a powerful group of men known as the Syndicate, who are somehow connected with the virus and willing to kill to keep their secrets safe.The X-Files film &quot;Fight the Future&quot; offers a very enjoyable transition from the television series to the big screen. I first saw the film, back when it was released in theaters. I had never seen a single episode from the show, and even though there were some things I did not understand, like who the Lone Gunmen were, the Syndicate's role in the overall conspiracy, etc., the film managed to entertain me. Now that the prices on the DVD sets for the show have been reduced, I was able to go back and finally watch the first five seasons. I recently watched the film again, and I really enjoyed it because I was finally able to understand all the smaller details that eluded me the first time around. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson are in fine form once again as Mulder and Scully. Martin Landau was very good as well. Fans of the show will be happy with the film, because it does a very good job expanding on the overall mythology, as well as bringing in characters from the show like Assitant Director Skinner played by Mitch Pillegi, the Lone Gunmen, and the Cigarette Smoking Man played by William Davis. The special effects, action sequences, and suspense this film brings will entertain people who have never seen the show.In my opinion, &quot;Fight the Future&quot; can be enjoyed by hardcore fans of the show, as well as a person who has never seen the show. I know this from experience because I was able to watch the film from both points of view. In fact, it was seeing the film the first time around that made me want to watch the show in the first place. The DVD itself offers top notch picture and sound quality, as well as commentary from Chris Carter, and an in-depth featurette on the making of the movie and the transition from the show to the big screen.A solid 5 stars...",5,An enjoyable move to the &quot;big screen&quot;,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,2820,"['X-Files', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Future', 'quot', 'place', 'end', 'season', 'five', 'when', 'X-Files', 'have', 'been', 'shut', 'down', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'are', 'assigned', 'Federal', 'building', 'Dallas', 'locate', 'bomb', 'Unfortunately', 'bomb', 'can', 'be', 'defused', 'FBI', 'agent', 'as', 'well', 'three', 'fireman', 'boy', 'are', 'killed', 'explosion', 'FBI', 'someone', 'blame', 'what', 'happened', 'look', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Wanting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'save', 'careers', 'Mulder', 'searching', 'clues', 'soon', 'paranoid', 'doctor', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'who', 'Mulder', 'conspiracy', 'dealing', 'deadly', 'virus', 'could', 'be', 'alien', 'origin', 'capable', 'destroying', 'life', 'earth', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'soon', 'forced', 'put', 'careers', 'lives', 'line', 'when', 'are', 'pitted', 'powerful', 'group', 'men', 'known', 'Syndicate', 'who', 'are', 'somehow', 'connected', 'virus', 'willing', 'kill', 'keep', 'secrets', 'safe.The', 'X-Files', 'film', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Future', 'quot', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'transition', 'television', 'series', 'big', 'screen', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'single', 'episode', 'show', 'even', 'were', 'things', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'who', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'were', 'Syndicate', 'role', 'overall', 'conspiracy', 'etc.', 'film', 'managed', 'entertain', 'Now', 'prices', 'DVD', 'sets', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'reduced', 'was', 'able', 'go', 'back', 'finally', 'watch', 'first', 'five', 'seasons', 'recently', 'watched', 'film', 'again', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'understand', 'smaller', 'details', 'eluded', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'are', 'fine', 'form', 'once', 'again', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'well', 'Fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'expanding', 'overall', 'mythology', 'as', 'well', 'bringing', 'characters', 'show', 'Assitant', 'Director', 'Skinner', 'played', 'Mitch', 'Pillegi', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'Cigarette', 'Smoking', 'Man', 'played', 'William', 'Davis', 'special', 'effects', 'action', 'sequences', 'suspense', 'film', 'will', 'entertain', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show.In', 'opinion', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Future', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'person', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'know', 'experience', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'film', 'points', 'view', 'fact', 'was', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'made', 'want', 'watch', 'show', 'first', 'place', 'DVD', 'top', 'notch', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'commentary', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'in-depth', 'featurette', 'making', 'movie', 'transition', 'show', 'big', 'screen.A', 'solid', '5', 'stars']",N/A

But now that I'm older, and I've got some shows under my belt, I thought I'd give the movie a try and to tell you what I was pleased.Far too often movies based on TV shows, that actually have the same characters and similar plots, end up being misguided and well, weak.  However, this film was a strong one, and I believe it guided the viewer to a new level of X-files that many fans at that point had probably been long in the waiting to see.And I'm not just talking about the Mulder/Scully relationship developing either, although the film touches on that to a degree.  I just mean the X-files story as a whole.  And sure, maybe the movie's plot could have been even a bit stronger, but it touched on loose ends from the series while giving new life to the characters, an accomplishment on it's own I'd say.So if you're a new fan, because I know all you old ones have seen it, then take a look.  Of course, if you've never watched a show you won't be left out either, so take a look at the film if you will, because I think you'll enjoy it.",4,The truth?

451498,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,6305142467,OverTheMoon,"[1, 5]","The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. The is the only X-Files to be in 5:1 Dolby Digital since the show was presented in 2:1 surround, not remastered to 5:1 for the Box Set releases.The X-Files: the movie, follows in the steps of Season Five and prepares us for Season Six although you don't have to see the Seasons in order to know what is going on as the movie can stand alone by itself (something which causes it to loose a little bit of what fan's prefer in exchange for slight alterations in tone and story for the movie-going masses). Season five ended with the X Files basement being burned down after the return of the Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) from the grave. Mulder once believed that the hegemony and the alien colonization of planet Earth was a con to detract from what is simply a series of government experiments on the citizens of planet Earth and the alien agenda just subterfuge. Scully however was absolutely convinced that Mulder was right all long and so took the lead role as the paranormal investigator while Mulder turned sceptic. This character switch now only needs Mulder to come around to what he originally believed, in order for both Mulder and Scully to be on the same wavelength for the first time. The X-Files is all about coming to that point and then some more.Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) make an appearance. Terry O'Quinn from the Millennium television series has a brief role as FBI agent Darius Michaud however the new characters are mainly veteran Hollywood actors brought in to vamp things up to movie quality. Martin Landau plays the paranoid Alvin Kurtzweil, MD set to expose the secret government. Armin Mueller-Stahl is Conrad Strughold, the new face of the mysterious ""the Group"", a sort of dark Einstein that has a few things to say about the fact that he has been forced to reassess his role by new effects in biology which have presented themselves as spontaneous population. The central most important character of the lot for this film is The Well-Manicured Man (John Neville from ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"") who is about to tell Mulder what the conspiracy is. The car scene in which this is revealed is nearly everything the fans have been waiting to hear although some points are left relatively obscure (so that we can have more Seasons about it). It is for this that most X-File lovers will be satiated and left spinning thinking about the ramifications of the new deadly threat. While not everything in the movie might not make movie quality sense (we have always ignored the holes to allow for quicker moving themes in the stories in the television series and the same applies here) and sometimes characters do or act in a very odd way along with lots of borrowing from movies we have seen before, the action midway possibly more than a little bit underachieving, many would have hoped for more, but alas this is just a big two hour episode with extra special effects and not the kind of movie-movie that maybe some expected. It is really a big play up to the delivery of the conspiracy in the car scene. Keep expectations low and the rewards are much higher. Hope to see Star Wars EP. III and you will be far from impressed. Critic weighing-scales aside the main reason to see this movie is that we could be seeing Mulder and Skully getting it on!... now why didn't I mention that earlier? If you just a regular movie goers outside of the fan base you can knock a star of this review.

451499,A3AJ1X5GT0NBO0,6305142467,"Parker Lewis ""park-lewis""","[4, 9]","My former roommate's girlfriend and I really like the TV show, &quot;The X-Files,&quot; especially the first couple of seasons. She was a really good friend of mine before I roomed with her boyfriend, so one time, I even  went with her to the X-Files convention to meet the &quot;Cancer  Man&quot;(, formally known as Cigarette-Smoking Man, or CSM for short). Her  boyfriend was not as big of a fan of the show; however, and after almost  every episode, he would have the same frustrated complaint: &quot;This show  always leaves more questions than it does answer them.&quot; I would always  have the same response: wait for the movie.You see, the series  creator Chris Carter promised that he would answer a lot of questions in  the movie several years ago, when he knew that there was going to be a big  screen production. So, my roommate, his girlfriend, myself and several  other thousand X-Files fans have been waiting anxiously for the release of  the new X-Files movie, &quot;The X-Files: Fight the Future.&quot;  Naturally, Chris Carter (CC, for short) had to make a movie that would  satiate the cravings of his TV series fans; and he also wanted a movie that  would appeal to non-fans to create a new fan base. He apparently has failed  on both accounts.Initially, after seeing the movie, I thought  that the fans who have recently caught on to &quot;The X-Files&quot; trend  and newbies would like it better than diehard fans. But then I found out  that even the newer fans were disappointed. As it turns out, I now have the  same complaint as my former roommate: the movie and the series leave too  many questions unanswered, while dishing out some new ones. So, as a  result, the newer fans are left in the dark as to what the heck is going  on, and the older fans leave the theater grumbling, promising that they'll  never watch another episode of the paranoid conspiracy-driven TV show.David Duchovny's(DD) character, FBI Agent Fox Mulder, unsurprisingly  translates well to the screen; however, Gillian Anderson's(GA) character,  Agent Dana Scully is a weaker, whiny, immature version of the character on  the TV show--which is sad, because GA's acting is far superior than DD's in  the series. Give credit to DD, though. His self-mockery in the film is a  welcome bright spot in a film that tries too hard and takes itself too  seriously.Or, perhaps not seriously enough. Can a movie be both  predictable and unintelligible? Somehow, &quot;The X-Files&quot; film  manages to do just that. It answers questions that we already knew the  answer to. Yet, it ignores some extremely basic plot lines that die hard  fans all expected to find out the answer to: you don't find out what  happened to Mulder's sister; you don't find out what is going on with the  clones; you don't find out what is going on with the rebellion; you don't  find out what happened with the genius kid that was introduced in the  Season Five finale; you don't find out what happened to Alex Krycek; you  don't find out what has become of the bounty hunter/shape shifter; and you  don't find out if CSM is Mulder's dad. And for the people who don't care  about those questions because they don't watch the show, characters will be  introduced to you without introduction. Newbies that I have met have felt  like outsiders on an in-joke. For example, CSM would stand amidst  pandemonium, puffing away on his Marlboros, saying nothing, nothing said  about him. One viewer felt as if they were watching some strange,  superficial, art-house flick.The reason why &quot;The  X-Files&quot; works as a TV show is because CC is able to suspend your  disbelief for an hour or two; the scariest things are unseen; and the  chemistry between DD's loony cop and GA's scientific cop works.

Not only was the dialouge laughable, the acting subpar, and the scenes unevely segemnted, but this movie totally contradicts every clue the series has been insinuating since season 3.First of all. What the hell is the black oil? From watching the Show, one could conclude that it is..1. An intelligent alien life form, capable of human posession and transubstantiation.2. A Substance created by our &quot;Shadow Governemnt&quot; that will assimilate human DNA into Alien (thereby turning humans into Aliens), when the invasion occurs.Well, The movie decides to put a new spin on this already impossible puzzle. We are now to believe that the Black oil is a substance (of unknown origin) that will impregnate a human being with an Alien fetus. Not acceptable!My guess is that they had to construct this film together under a very tight deadline. It shows. Scenes that should have been done again are left to their initial badness. The actors sound as if they're doing a cold reading of the script.Smoking man! He had one of the most dramatic entrances I have ever seen in Hollywood history (the blaring white lights, in the dark Kansas night, with the wind of the helicopter disheveling his hair, as he reaches for his trademark cigarette....Tadaah! Its him!). I thought the movie would finally start to pick up once he arrived. Nope. He just just bummed around, mumbled his usual assortment of vague facist innuendos, and puffed his Morleys. The movie could have functioned just as well without him. He did nothing, Niether Did Skinner, the Lone Gunman, or any of the show's featured regulars. Such crucial supporting characters as Marita Covarubias, Alex Krycek, and the Alien Bounty Hunter were left out of the film completely. That's why I say this movie wasn't one for the fans.

Those who have never seen the show won't have trouble watching the movie because it's self-contained. That is the genius of Chris Carter. He has created a movie where it works perfectly as a contiuation of the previous season finale titled &quot;The End&quot; for fans, but still works perfectly for non-fans and will entertain both groups even more with the season premiere that followed titled &quot;The Beginning.&quot; The movie isn't total spectacle, but it's smart and creepy and richly-photographed. Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny are also great actors and Rob Bowman has a lot of style in his directing. &quot;The X-Files Movie&quot; is a nice mystery thriller. But what sets it apart from other flicks is the fact that Chris Carter's screenplay gives some reality and plausibility to his alien colonization conspiracy. Here we get detailed scientific facts, realistic political scenarios and an attention to detail that is meticulous. I'm sure that &quot;The X-Files&quot; show and movie have brought reality and plausibility and even romanticism to wild alien conspiracy ideas like no other show or film.

451510,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305142467,Robert Moore,"[4, 4]","At the time, THE X-FILES: FACE THE FUTURE was widely regarded as a disappointment.  For one thing, it was not a film that had the potential to appeal strongly to nonfans of the series.  It absolutely did not stand alone or provide a narrative that was unconnected with the series as a whole.  In fact, it was essentially a transition piece from Season Five to Season Six of the series.  As a film, it was limited in what it was able to achieve.  But today if we view it primarily as a pivot from Season Five to Season Six (which is probably the only way that it can be seen today), it is a very satisfying expanded episode.Season Five memorably ended with the demise of the X-Files, not merely with their being closed, but with the actual physical files being demolished in an office fire set by the Cigarette Smoking Man.  Mulder and Scully had also failed to protect Gibson, a young boy who had the capacity to read minds (and who had more or less told Mulder and Scully, ever repressed in matters of the heart, that they were in love with one another).  The movie picks up the narrative at precisely this point, with Mulder and Scully working in Texas as part of a large team working on a bomb case.  Likewise, Season Six of the series would pick up immediately following the end of the action of the movie, with Mulder and Scully being debriefed at a meeting, basically recounting the major events covered in the film.  In other words, the film is completely embedded in Seasons Five and Six of the television show.Obviously, everyone who was part of the series had to be fitted into the film somehow.  So we get brief appearances by everyone from Skinner to the Lone Gunmen to The Well-Manicured Man (who memorably departs the series in the film) to the Cigarette Smoking Man.  But luckily despite the need and/or urge to put as much in the film as possible, the film features a lot of time with classic Mulder/Scully interaction.  They come within centimeters of logging their first kiss ever (a long, slow, deliberate almost-kiss--though their joint ability to forget such a moment becomes more than a little trying afterwards).  There are hordes of aliens that Mulder has to save Scully from, but which she conveniently misses when she passes out at key moments.  There is even a huge spaceship that rises from the Artic icebed that Scully again manages to miss at key moments (and which provides a nice comic moment in Season Eight, when a worshipping FBI agent asks them how Mulder was able to get Scully back to civilization after he had run out of gas).After the end of THE X-FILES series, it is rumored that Chris Carter declined to make additional films so near the end of the show.  Today, however, there have been multiple rumors that all of the key figures are more amenable to reprising THE X-FILES on the silver screen.  Because the series is no longer running, and there is no story line to tie into, I actually have higher hopes for additional films than I did for the original.  David Duchovny says that the screenplay Chris Carter is working on focuses less on aliens and more on the supernatural.  It is fascinating to speculate on how a new film would go, since Mulder and Scully were not actually on the X-Files any longer at the end of the show.  On the other hand, they apparently poised to finally have that full blown romance that seemed to be percolating for seasons.  Will Mulder be back in the FBI?  Will Mulder and Scully be a couple?  Will the Cigarette Smoking Man appear (yeah, he got killed--again--but don't tell me that that is any impediment to his return)?  Have the X-Files been reopened?

451516,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305142467,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[0, 1]","In this extended episode of the X-Files, Scully and Mulder are re-assigned to an anti-terrorism task-force of the FBI. (The FBI has ended Fox Mulder's mission to uncover evidence of a massive conspiracy of aliens and humans to do something incredibly severe to mankind; now that they're no longer scoping for little green men, the least the bureaus can expect is to get a little descent work out of them.) The flick reunites us with Scully and Mulder during an horrific Oklahoma City style bombing - but not before a prolog set during the ice age in which antediluvian men battle a feral looking alien. Back to modern times - when the bombing begins to look less like an act of terrorism than another act of cover-up for the UFO-conspiracy, Mulder and Scully spring to action.Actually, how many episodes of the show does that brief synopsis describe? This movie takes advantage of being a feature release (Mulder gets to curse; the special effects look better, including the mammoth explosion that kicks off the flick; the characters joke with each other as they haven't on the show - Mulder's ""panic face"" being a prime example) but never excels enough past the show that spawned it. While the show tended to offer cinematic quality in characters, scripting and direction, the flick itself looks like something off-the-shelf - they took an episode and stretched it out past an hour. Instead of making a more interesting and compelling film, the script just throws in a bigger and heavier version of the ""X-Files"" we've grown to love). Rather than stake new ground that could appeal to fans and newbies alike, the story simply brings us back to our favorite principals of the UFO Conspiracy (led by ""Cigarette""; John Neville also returns) Armin Mueller appears to give the film's best line, when he reassures the other conspirators not to worry about Mulder ""One Man Cannot Fight the Future"". Despite the cinematic effort, there's little you can say about an alien movie without a particularly interesting alien - the one here turns out to be just another long-clawed, hyper-salivary beast that leaps out of the shadows. The flick also wastes some characters you know deserve the extra effort (Terry Quinn plays a veteran agent blown to hell in the first few minutes; Martin Landau plays another one of the many conspiracy theorists who offers Mulder ""the answers"", but none of the answers that can be substantiated; Blythe Danner plays a federal investigator, one of many to read one of Scully's reports which are of course unbelievable; the beloved ""Lone Gunmen"" make a surprise appearance, but a short one). The flick's biggest weakness is that it came out while the show was still on - so it couldn't do anything earth-shaking with its characters. So many conspiracies and counter-conspiracies plague both the movie and the show, that neither gets around to solving the biggest mystery of all - why did they make this movie?",2,Just a bigger episode of the show,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",2005,2928,"['extended', 'episode', 'X-Files', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'are', 're-assigned', 'anti-terrorism', 'task-force', 'FBI', 'FBI', 'ended', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'mission', 'uncover', 'evidence', 'massive', 'conspiracy', 'aliens', 'humans', 'do', 'something', 'incredibly', 'severe', 'mankind', 'now', ""'re"", 'longer', 'scoping', 'little', 'green', 'men', 'least', 'bureaus', 'can', 'expect', 'get', 'little', 'descent', 'work', 'flick', 'Scully', 'Mulder', 'horrific', 'Oklahoma', 'City', 'style', 'bombing', 'not', 'prolog', 'set', 'ice', 'age', 'antediluvian', 'men', 'battle', 'feral', 'looking', 'alien', 'Back', 'modern', 'times', 'when', 'bombing', 'look', 'less', 'act', 'terrorism', 'act', 'cover-up', 'UFO-conspiracy', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'spring', 'action.Actually', 'how', 'many', 'episodes', 'show', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'describe', 'movie', 'advantage', 'being', 'feature', 'release', 'Mulder', 'curse', 'special', 'effects', 'look', 'better', 'including', 'mammoth', 'explosion', 'flick', 'characters', 'joke', 'other', 'have', ""n't"", 'show', 'Mulder', 'panic', 'face', 'being', 'prime', 'example', 'never', 'excels', 'enough', 'show', 'spawned', 'show', 'tended', 'offer', 'cinematic', 'quality', 'characters', 'scripting', 'direction', 'flick', 'something', 'off-the-shelf', 'took', 'episode', 'stretched', 'out', 'hour', 'Instead', 'making', 'more', 'interesting', 'compelling', 'film', 'script', 'just', 'bigger', 'heavier', 'version', 'X-Files', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'Rather', 'stake', 'new', 'ground', 'could', 'appeal', 'fans', 'newbies', 'alike', 'story', 'simply', 'back', 'favorite', 'principals', 'UFO', 'Conspiracy', 'led', 'Cigarette', 'John', 'Neville', 'also', 'Armin', 'Mueller', 'give', 'film', 'best', 'line', 'when', 'other', 'conspirators', 'not', 'worry', 'Mulder', 'One', 'Man', 'Can', 'not', 'Fight', 'Future', 'cinematic', 'effort', 'little', 'can', 'say', 'alien', 'movie', 'particularly', 'interesting', 'alien', 'one', 'here', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'long-clawed', 'hyper-salivary', 'beast', 'shadows', 'flick', 'also', 'characters', 'know', 'deserve', 'extra', 'effort', 'Terry', 'Quinn', 'veteran', 'agent', 'blown', 'hell', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'one', 'many', 'conspiracy', 'theorists', 'who', 'Mulder', 'answers', 'none', 'answers', 'can', 'be', 'substantiated', 'Blythe', 'Danner', 'federal', 'investigator', 'one', 'many', 'read', 'one', 'Scully', 'reports', 'are', 'course', 'unbelievable', 'beloved', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'make', 'surprise', 'appearance', 'short', 'one', 'flick', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'came', 'out', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'earth-shaking', 'characters', 'So', 'many', 'conspiracies', 'counter-conspiracies', 'plague', 'movie', 'show', 'around', 'solving', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'why', 'did', 'make', 'movie']",N/A

451523,A2I7ZAB04Q0DML,6305142467,Scott Kolecki,"[3, 3]","Before seeing &quot;Fight the Future&quot;, I had never had much interest in the X-files. I had always wanted to get into the series, but had been told by &quot;philers&quot; (X-file followers) that you really needed to see the series from the beginning to understand all the lore and mythology that was developed by series creator and producer, Chris Carter.Despite this, I went to see &quot;X-Files: Fight the Futre&quot; and I became an immediate fan.  The movie is a great starting point for people unfamiliar with the series.  The movie, through some clever dialogue and settings, gives a brief back history of the characters and events that have led up to the film, which served as a bridge between seasons 5 and 6 of the televison program.  Fans of the series criticized the film, stating that the movie simplifed the immense conspiracy that had been developed by the series, but I found that, having no background with the X-files, it was just the catalyst I needed to launch my interest and give me the foundation for following the series.The story introduces us to Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovney) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), members of a classified agency within the heart of the F.B.I. that investigates paranormal and extra-terrestrial activities.  It is established early in the film that Mulder and Scully have been removed from the X-files, for reasons which were established in the television series.  Despite this fact, they stumble across an &quot;incident&quot; that occurs in Texas, where a cover-up has been put into motion that will lead them to some extraordinary discoveries that nearly costs them their lives.My synopsis of the film is deliberately vague, and for those of you reading this for understanding, I can say only that it is better that you come into this film with an open mind about it, as I did when I first saw it.  The reason I give for this is that the story is not merely an independent film, but part of a much larger storyline that encompasses a generational television series, with this film serving as one of the high point in the series plot.  You need to approach it without a pre-conceived notion as to what the film is about, because, as I experienced with my inital viewing of the film, the movie left me with as many questions as it answered, and because of my interest in the film, I went in search of a greater understanding of the stories and characters found within the X-files.The film was obviously produced on a much larger production budget than that of the television show, but, to its credit, the movie does not spend a lot of time using special effects to create tension.  Instead, the tension of the film is built in the same way it is done in the television show-by providing paranoia that stems from shadowy agents within the Federal Government who act in the interest of their private agendas.  The resulting effect is a movie that works well on creating paranoia and leaves you anticipating, but never really knowing, whats going to happen next.The film features much of the production talent of the series, including direction for Carter, as well as a great soundtrack by Mark Snow, who had the aid of an orchestra to amplify his classic television scoring.  In addition, all of the principles of the series are present.This movie, in this reviewers opinion, arrived at a time when the X-files was at the prime of its success and popularity, and it is definitely a strong installment in the X-files franchise.  Since my initial viewing of this film, I have become an avid fan, a &quot;philer&quot; if you will, and I still find the film to be a great installment in a series which implored that the audience &quot;TRUST NO ONE&quot;.  Well make an exception and trust me when I say that  &quot;X-Files: Fight the Future&quot; is a worthwhile film, and a great adventure for fans of the series, or for those who have never before experienced the adventures and investigations of Mulder and Scully.Scott Kolecki",5,"The Truth Is Out There, And It Says This Is A Great Movie!",1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,3990,"['seeing', 'quot', 'Fight', 'Future', 'quot', 'had', 'never', 'had', 'much', 'interest', 'X-files', 'had', 'always', 'wanted', 'get', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'quot', 'philers', 'quot', 'X-file', 'followers', 'really', 'needed', 'see', 'series', 'beginning', 'understand', 'lore', 'mythology', 'was', 'developed', 'series', 'creator', 'producer', 'Chris', 'Carter.Despite', 'went', 'see', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Futre', 'quot', 'became', 'immediate', 'fan', 'movie', 'great', 'starting', 'point', 'people', 'unfamiliar', 'series', 'movie', 'clever', 'dialogue', 'settings', 'brief', 'back', 'history', 'characters', 'events', 'have', 'led', 'up', 'film', 'served', 'bridge', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'televison', 'program', 'Fans', 'series', 'criticized', 'film', 'stating', 'movie', 'simplifed', 'immense', 'conspiracy', 'had', 'been', 'developed', 'series', 'found', 'having', 'background', 'X-files', 'was', 'just', 'catalyst', 'needed', 'launch', 'interest', 'give', 'foundation', 'following', 'series.The', 'story', 'introduces', 'Agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovney', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'members', 'classified', 'agency', 'heart', 'F.B.I', 'paranormal', 'extra-terrestrial', 'activities', 'established', 'early', 'film', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'have', 'been', 'removed', 'X-files', 'reasons', 'were', 'established', 'television', 'series', 'fact', 'stumble', 'quot', 'incident', 'quot', 'Texas', 'where', 'cover-up', 'been', 'put', 'motion', 'will', 'lead', 'extraordinary', 'discoveries', 'nearly', 'lives.My', 'synopsis', 'film', 'deliberately', 'vague', 'reading', 'understanding', 'can', 'say', 'only', 'better', 'come', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'did', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'reason', 'give', 'story', 'not', 'merely', 'independent', 'film', 'part', 'much', 'larger', 'storyline', 'generational', 'television', 'series', 'film', 'serving', 'one', 'high', 'point', 'series', 'plot', 'need', 'approach', 'pre-conceived', 'notion', 'what', 'film', 'about', 'because', 'experienced', 'inital', 'viewing', 'film', 'movie', 'left', 'many', 'questions', 'answered', 'interest', 'film', 'went', 'search', 'greater', 'understanding', 'stories', 'characters', 'found', 'X-files.The', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'produced', 'much', 'larger', 'production', 'budget', 'television', 'show', 'credit', 'movie', 'not', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'using', 'special', 'effects', 'create', 'tension', 'Instead', 'tension', 'film', 'built', 'same', 'way', 'done', 'television', 'show-by', 'providing', 'paranoia', 'shadowy', 'agents', 'Federal', 'Government', 'who', 'act', 'interest', 'private', 'agendas', 'resulting', 'effect', 'movie', 'well', 'creating', 'paranoia', 'anticipating', 'never', 'really', 'knowing', 'whats', 'going', 'happen', 'next.The', 'film', 'features', 'much', 'production', 'talent', 'series', 'including', 'direction', 'Carter', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'soundtrack', 'Mark', 'Snow', 'who', 'had', 'aid', 'orchestra', 'amplify', 'classic', 'television', 'scoring', 'addition', 'principles', 'series', 'are', 'present.This', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'opinion', 'arrived', 'time', 'when', 'X-files', 'was', 'prime', 'success', 'popularity', 'definitely', 'strong', 'installment', 'X-files', 'franchise', 'initial', 'viewing', 'film', 'have', 'become', 'avid', 'fan', 'quot', 'quot', 'will', 'still', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'great', 'installment', 'series', 'implored', 'audience', 'quot', 'TRUST', 'NO', 'ONE', 'quot', 'Well', 'make', 'exception', 'trust', 'when', 'say', 'quot', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', 'quot', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'great', 'adventure', 'fans', 'series', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'before', 'experienced', 'adventures', 'investigations', 'Mulder', 'Scully.Scott', 'Kolecki']",N/A

The only difference between this movie and, say, a two or three part X-Files story arc is the size of the budget, effects and the guest stars. The writing, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to the best the series offered. Nevertheless, it's a fine theatrical episode of the series.Thousands of years ago an alien species ruled this planet. Humanity was just an afterthought. It's clear that these aliens want to regain control of the planet and members of the government have made a pact with the devil; humanity will become a slave race to these aliens (and other things you don't want to know about if you haven't seen the movie otherwise it'll spoil plot points).Somehow all of this is tied into two little boys that discover an ancient underground cavern. One of the boys is infected with some sort of virus as are several rescue workers. In another part of the US, Mulder and Scully are checking out terrorist threat against the US. The building that Mulder and Scully and the rest of the team believe to be the target is a decoy. Mulder and Scully accidently discover the real target. The mystery at the heart of the film is why the terrorist targeted a building that had the agency FEMA in it when there were more vital government agencies they could have hit. Also, the building was evacuated. So how come there were two victims discovered in the rubble?All of this remains at the heart of the mystery and it does, indeed, play into the alien conspiracy story arc than began to be undcovered in season one of the series. If you're interested in ""The X-Files"" but haven't seen the entire series, this movie is still comprehensible to the average moviegoer. The ramifications of the plot, however, will be much more important if you've seen the bulk of seasons 2-6 first (season 1 just sets up the conspiracy angle and is important but not a central part of the conspiracy arc).The picture quality is pretty good considering this came out close to the beginning of the DVD craze. It could be improved with an anamorphic widescreen transfer (higher picture quality)and with a separate disc of extras. The extras aren't bad here they're just not as indepth as they should be. My guess is that Fox plans on re-releasing this on DVD when the new X-Files movie comes out in 2006 and/or within the next year or two because they've finally got the entire series on DVD.Well worth picking up for fans but for casual new viewers, I'd suggest starting with seasons 2-6 to fully understand the consequences of this film's plot line.

451547,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,6305142467,wellwellwell,"[2, 5]","I agree with a number of other reviewers in saying `X-Files: The Movie' is built for anyone; even if you have not seen a single X-Files episode.  But what separates this movie from the endless chapters of alien chasing and studying is its epic magnitude.  Most people know that Mulder had been claiming aliens abducted his sister from day one.  What this film does is put that issue to rest (amongst others).  So, in essence, this movie offers closure to what has been building from the very first episode.  This film is by no means perfect, as it seems the formulaic ideas of Hollywood are being squeezed in for good measure.  At one point in this movie, there is a connection between Mulder and Scully that hints at a lost romance that never occurred, but should've, between the two stars.  Sure, it lasted only about ten seconds, but the longtime fan might be forced to let out a soft chuckle at how unfitting it was.  Also, even in a movie about extraterrestrials, a few action sequences seemed to go over-the-top.  Watching Mulder dangle and recover like Sylvester Stallone in `Cliffhanger' was something we could've done without.Once you get passed the few over-exaggerated aspects of the film, everything else seems to work perfectly.  The very beginning of the movie is excellent, a definite attention getter.  And from there the movie works in the same fashion that an episode would.  But it's almost like you're watching four episodes in a row.  And since they don't have to cram a whole x-file into one 30 minute bit, the movie becomes more elaborate and a bit more calm.  Some people might cite this as bad, but others might love it.  The story is well scripted and the acting by everyone is flawless.  Duchovny and Anderson are as good as ever, and other actors like Martin Landau and Mitch Pileggi (as Skinner) do great justice to the movie's brilliant casting.`X-Files: The Movie' has a pretty apparent target audience.  The average diehard X-fan will obviously enjoy every moment and love it (if they haven't seen it already).  And on the other hand, anyone who hates Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, and every episode they stumbled upon while channel surfing should do their best to avoid this one.  Finally, there's the people in the middle (like me).  If you have seen numerous installments of the X-Files on TV, but don't live and die by them, you will most likely benefit from this film in the same manner that the diehards do.  It is extremely enjoyable, well written from start to finish--minus the few exaggerations--and, again, is an epic culmination that just about every admirer can say they've been waiting for.

I've never been more than a casual viewer and, to me, this film represents the best the series had to offer.Everyone knows that creator Chris Carter was inspired byNight Stalker - The Complete Serieswhen he formulated The X-Files. Whereas that brief 70s series was overt and almost cartoony with it's depictions of the paranormal, The X-Files always took a more subdued, realistic approach. To some, this made it boring; to others, fascinating; to many, a mixture of both.The way the plot in the movie unfolds is similar to ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition),"" albeit more serious and quasi-believable. After an explosion reminiscent of the Oklahoma City bombing, FBI agents Mulder and Scully stumble on an otherworldy virus and an intricate governmental cover-up. Their investigation leads them all over the map and, ultimately, to Antarctica, with numerous mysterious happenings.Other than the paranormal, the appeal of The X-Files has always been Gillian Anderson.

451550,AP3B615GM191G,6305142467,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","For nearly all successful television dramas, there comes the conflict of when the show should end.  For most of the X-Files' first few seasons, show creator Chris Carter imagined the show running five seasons, then spinning off into a series of motion pictures (much like the original series of Star Trek).  However, with the Fifth Season of the X-Files garnering the best ratings in the show's history, it became obvious that the FOX network would do anything it could to bring its most successful hour back.Now, what does that above statement have to do with this movie?  During the promotion of the movie, the creators touted it as giving ""all the answers"", essentially the be-all, end-all of the X-Files' many plotlines.  Because of the show's tremendous popularity, however, the writers/producers could not put all their cards on the table quite yet.  Despite clearing up many questions surrounding the Syndicate's involvement with the alien colonists (more specifically, how colonization will occur), this movie did not, by any means, provide ALL the answers, and was heavily criticized (even in these reviews) for it.  In fact, just as many loose ends were brought up as were tied off.So, why does this movie still get a five-star rating from me?  Because, despite its false-advertising, the movie still contains every aspect that made previous seasons of the X-Files so great: thrilling action, mind-bending plots, and witty, sardonic humor.  Plus, as fans found out in the next two seasons, the X-Files still had many more great stories to tell.  Ending the series with this movie would have cheated its loyal fans out of some more great drama.  Though I will admit that the show drastically changed when it returned after the movie, many viewers (including myself) find the later seasons to be just as thrilling as the earlier fare.Overall, this is a great movie for any fan of science-fiction.  As unbelievable as this may sound, this movie was the first X-Files fare of any kind I ever saw (imagine my confusion!), yet it still hooked me enough to become an avid follower, proving that you don't have to be an uber-fan to appreciate this film.",5,The Crucial Decision,1212019200,"05 29, 2008",2008,2155,"['nearly', 'successful', 'television', 'dramas', 'conflict', 'when', 'show', 'should', 'end', 'most', 'X-Files', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'show', 'creator', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'imagined', 'show', 'running', 'five', 'seasons', 'then', 'spinning', 'off', 'series', 'motion', 'pictures', 'much', 'original', 'series', 'Star', 'Trek', 'However', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'X-Files', 'garnering', 'best', 'ratings', 'show', 'history', 'became', 'obvious', 'FOX', 'network', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'could', 'bring', 'most', 'successful', 'hour', 'back.Now', 'what', 'statement', 'have', 'do', 'movie', 'promotion', 'movie', 'creators', 'touted', 'giving', 'answers', 'essentially', 'be-all', 'end-all', 'X-Files', 'many', 'plotlines', 'show', 'tremendous', 'popularity', 'however', 'writers/producers', 'could', 'not', 'put', 'cards', 'table', 'quite', 'yet', 'clearing', 'up', 'many', 'questions', 'surrounding', 'Syndicate', 'involvement', 'alien', 'colonists', 'more', 'specifically', 'how', 'colonization', 'will', 'occur', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'means', 'provide', 'answers', 'was', 'heavily', 'criticized', 'even', 'reviews', 'fact', 'just', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'brought', 'up', 'were', 'tied', 'off.So', 'why', 'movie', 'still', 'get', 'five-star', 'rating', 'false-advertising', 'movie', 'still', 'aspect', 'made', 'previous', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'so', 'great', 'thrilling', 'action', 'mind-bending', 'plots', 'witty', 'sardonic', 'humor', 'fans', 'found', 'out', 'next', 'two', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'still', 'had', 'many', 'more', 'great', 'stories', 'tell', 'Ending', 'series', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'cheated', 'loyal', 'fans', 'more', 'great', 'drama', 'will', 'admit', 'show', 'drastically', 'changed', 'when', 'returned', 'movie', 'many', 'viewers', 'including', 'find', 'later', 'seasons', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'thrilling', 'earlier', 'fare.Overall', 'great', 'movie', 'fan', 'science-fiction', 'As', 'unbelievable', 'may', 'sound', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'X-Files', 'fare', 'kind', 'ever', 'saw', 'imagine', 'confusion', 'still', 'hooked', 'enough', 'become', 'avid', 'follower', 'proving', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'uber-fan', 'appreciate', 'film']",N/A
