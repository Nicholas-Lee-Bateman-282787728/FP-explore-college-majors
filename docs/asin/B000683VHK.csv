862876,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000683VHK,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[2, 3]","Stander was a very good film about the real-life exploits of Andre Stander, Lee McCall and Allan Heyl who were known collectively as The Stander Gang. The Stander Gang was well-known for their daring and reckless bank robberies in their homeland of South Africa. The film stars Tom Jane (The Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) as the title character with Dexter Fletcher (Band of Brothers and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and David Patrick O'Hara (Braveheart) rounding out the rest of the Stander Gang.The film starts off introducing Andre Stander as a highly decorated member of the South African Police Force in the late 1970's and the beginning of the anti-apartheid movement. It shows Andre Stander's growing disgust and disenchantment in his government's racist apartheid policies and his own role in enforcing it. After a violent and brutal break-up of an anti-apartheid protest gathering where Stander kills a protestor, the film begins to move into meat of the story. Stander's disenchantment with the government causes him to commit bank robberis in audacious fashion as a way to rebel and defy the very state he has sworn to protect and serve.The scenes where Stander commits these bank robberies were shot well and showed just how daring Andre Stander really was in his exploits. There's even a sequence where he returns to the scene of his most recent crime to investigate the robbery. A robbery he just committed just hours before during his lunchtime. These scenes and the later ones when he's joined by two other bank robbers shows Tom Jane at his finest. I think many would be hard-pressed not to think Jane's performance as a South African, accent and all, wasn't authentic. His charisma ruled throughout the film and was mostly evident through the many bank robbing sequences. He truly gave Andre Stander the air of a Robin Hood character who, despite his criminal acts, became a sort of folk antihero.The second half of the film details the exploits of Stander after his incarceration for his bank robberies while a captain of the South African Police Force. It's here that we meet the rest of Stander's Gang as he recruits fellow inmate and outlaws Lee McCall and Allan Heyl. Even the way Stander engineers his escape from the work-prison he has been sent to shows his daring in thumbing his nose at the state and the police he used to be a part of. Dexter Fletcher was very good as the twitchy and less stable Lee McCall whose nerves begin to fray the bolder and bolder the gangs bank robberies become. David Patrick O'Hara was also good as the very professional bank robber Allan Heyl. Heyl didn't have the charisma that Stander had, but he was the rock which kept the robberies from spiraling out of their control. It was great to see O'Hara in another strong role. Some might recognize him as the scene-stealing Stephen, the Irish rebel who joins William Wallace's fight against the English during Mel Gibson's Braveheart.The rest of the film was pretty much one bank robbery after the other with the Stander Gang always one step ahead of the police task force put together to capture them. In a twist of fate, the task force was headed by Stander's former friend in the police force Cor Van Deverter whose intimate knowledge of Stander's tactics and thought-processes helps in slowly closing the noose around the gang. There's abit of a repitition in the robberies and the getaways, but they serve an important purpose of slowly building up the Stander Gang's folkhero status amongst the population. It also showed the effect it had on some of the members of the gang. As popular and infamous the gang had become they were still outlaws who knew that sooner or later their luck would run out and they'd either be put back into prison or killed outright. For some it was the latter and for others the former.Throughout the film, one could sense that some of the motivations behind Andre Stander's actions as a bank robber was to assuage his guilt over the sanctioned acts of brutality he had to perform to protect the apartheid government of his nation. The film and the story being told was almost a full-lenght film of Stander's attempt to make up for his past transgressions. And what better way to do this than use the system of the state against itself. He himself points out that a white man could get away with anything when most of the policemen in the city were called away to deal with an emergency regarding the black majority population. Stander realizes this to be true and his second career as a bank robber was born. The film only hints at him being a very good policeman, but the majority of the film shows just how much better he was as a criminal.The film was expertly directed by Bronwen Hughes and as said earlier had strong performances from all the main leads in the film. The story rarely slowed down to the point that the story lost its direction. Every scene always led to the next part of the story being told until the very bitter end. Stander was a very good film anchored by a fine performance from Tom Jane. The film showed a brief glimpse into South Africa's apartheid past and how one individual's decision to defy the state led to a brief, but daring life of a modern-day Robin Hood.",4,Tom Jane does a

862880,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000683VHK,Eric Sanberg,"[0, 0]","Tom Jane plays Andre Stander, a police captain in South Africa during Apartheid. He's becoming more and more disheartened by the way blacks are treated, and he's put over the edge after killing a black man during an escalating political demonstration. He begins easing his guilt and protesting the current political situation by robbing banks. He's caught, imprisoned, escapes and starts all over again. This time, though, he has the help of two guys he helped break out of prison.This IS a good movie. It's very watchable. The writer/producers did a fine job capturing the time and place. Jane does a great job as Stander. His look and accent are right on the dollar. The supporting cast is good and I liked a lot of the soundtrack. Where this falls short is in the story itself. Stander's whole adventure began with his being disillusioned by the political climate in South Africa, but that is dealt with only lightly. Much of the film involves the many robberies, all done in various disguises, and the team's subsequent rise as media anti-heroes. They also do a decent job of portraying Stander's longing to re-establish the relationship with his wife, but again, it plays second fiddle to the robberies. As in other ""rise of a gangster"" movies, you see the successes and the perps' rise in life-style but this is run-of-the-mill. It carries no emotional weight.This is a good watch.

862884,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000683VHK,Grady Harp,"[17, 20]","So speaks Andre Stander the day after a massive riot in Johannesburg South Africa in which Stander as a police captain finds himself killing a Zulu man in a morally shattering encounter.  This utter disillusionment with the police force and their responses to the Apartheid situation makes Stander withdraw emotionally and physically from the Riot Squad and eventually his challenge that the blacks are unduly mistreated leads him to break the white laws by initiating a string of bank robberies - not for money but for a bizarre sort of revenge.Stander (Tom Jane) is good at what he does, both as a cop and as a criminal, but his clever bank heists eventually result in his being jailed where he finds two partners (David O'Hara and Dexter Fletcher) to join him in escape and in one of the longest bank robbery sprees in the history of South Africa.  Stander remains conflicted: he loves his new wife Bekkie (Deborah Kara Unger), he knows what he is doing is wrong, but the money is often shared with the blacks of Johannesburg, and he is driven to leave South Africa to eventually locate in Lauderdale, Florida.  The eventual results of this man's career bring this film to a close in an action packed yet very soulful way.The film, as written by Bima Stagg and directed by Bronwen Hughes, captures the atmosphere of the era in South Africa, and gives us a realistic look at the plight of the Africans in the Apartheid, offering insights to both sides of the conflict like few others have in film.  He coaxes fine performances from his large cast of actors and extras, making this film less an action thriller than a character study of the enigmatic Andre Stander.The true star of this film, a film that deserves far more attention than it has been given, is Tom Jane.  Jane is a strong actor, able to take on language accents with the best of them,  and able to make us understand the spectrum of personality in this fascinating character.  There are many scenes in which he plays in full nudity, quite apropos to the story, but just an indication of his commitment to 'fleshing out' of his role.  He is an actor to watch, an actor unafraid of tough roles in contrast to the showy Hollywood star parts.

You can't help but watch to find out how his story ends, what will happen and WHY he does what he does. The film doesn't reveal all but that is fine. Perhaps there weren't any absolute answers as to WHY Stander did what he did. Perhaps his behavior mystified him as much as anyone (the film hints at that).I can see why this one didn't reach more people, as the accents can make it hard to understand some of the dialogue. There are also some slower parts that are necessary for understanding Stander but which viewers might find wearisome (I did not).This is far above most of the ""highly acclaimed"" movies you'll find at the theatre or your local DVD/video/game store.

Cockrel,"[2, 9]","Tom Jane, who recently starred in the dissappointing, ""The Punisher"" dissappoints yet again ""Stander.""Here he stars in the real life account of Andres Stander, a White Apartheid-era South African cop who later became his country's most notorious bank robber.To his credit, Jane gives a solid perfomance. But he's failed by a weak script which never fleshes his character out.  As a result, Stander remains enigma not only to his family, friends, and partners in crime but also to the viewer.The movie never really lets us see what makes Stander tick and what drives him to bank robbery.  We are led to believe that it stems from his role in the police suppression of a Black South African protest march against the country's education policies.  When White South African cops respond with lethal violence, Stander shoots an unarmed Black man.The movie suggests that this action plunges him into a deep emotional and spiritual crisis that finds him questioning the very system he's been laboring in service to.I can't buy that because Stander is shown to be a high ranking, motivated officer who is well-liked by his peers and superiors.  He is even referred to at one point as ""the youngest captain in the history of the force.""Are we to believe that Stander achieved this level of success in this system in some sort of blissful ignorance that his government was corrupt, racist, and violent?  Can we accept that a law enforcement officer of this rank and prominence in South Africa at that time had not only never before engaged in unnecessary force against Blacks but was also clueless about what his fellow cops really got up to whenever they stormed the Black townships?The movie also doesn't do a good job of explaining whether or not Stander saw crime as a means of atoning in some way for past actions or if he just decided buy into another form of corruption purely for personal gain.This is because Stander, as shown here, certainly wasn't a Robin Hood figure who stole money only to give it to poor, South African Blacks.The film depicts only one instance where Stander gives stolen money to a Black person, in this case a pan-handling child.  The action seems to be motivated more by a desire to not be caught with evidence than by any sense of altruism.Director Bronwen Hughes seems unable to decide if this film should be a commentary on the policies of Apartheid-era South Africa or just a ripping crime yarn.

In prison, he met up with a couple of fellow inmates.  They escaped and went on a bank robbing spree.

No, that is not the entire story. STANDER is also a superb action and adventure tale of a white cop who goes bad and starts robbing banks. The writer of STANDER would have us believe that Stander's turn to crime is due to guilt for his actions against a black man during a riot. That may be true but it also just may be true that Andre Stander, played wonderfully by Tom Jane, was just a crook and a rotten cop. Leave it to Hollywood to tell us again and again how evil whites are. Of course, some years after Apartheid came Rwanda where black Hutus slaughtered a million black Tutus in one year, maybe a 1000 times the lynchings in the US in one hundred years. Yet, in this movie, Stander is so burdered by guilt for his ""misdeed"" that he starts robbing banks. In light of Rwanda, this seems grotesquely silly but strangely redeeming. How many Hutus felt guilty for hacking their brothers to death, man, woman and child, with machetes purchased from China so that they didn't have to waste bullets?
