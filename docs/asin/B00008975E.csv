Often times, you see color separation in the video and it looks very primative.  Yes, it is a very old video but New West Records has done a much better with Austin City Limits transfers delivering superior sound and picture quality.  It looks like Image Entertainment didn't work on this dvd at all.  What a shame.",2,Good Show...

On this DVD copy of Live At Austin City Limits, Roy handles his crowd the same way as when I saw him.  He starts everything off very slow and easy and by the time he belts out ""Crying"" he has the crowd eating out of his hand and screaming for more.I found the DVD very enjoyable.  The only black mark against it is that early in the DVD there seem to be some problems with focusing of the stage right camera, which made some scenes to appear blurry at times.  I enjoyed the many close-ups of Roy.  You could see how much he was enjoying himself and you could make out how little effort he was using with his 10 octave voice to reach those high notes that became his legacy.Although I found his band over played ""Working for the Man,"" it was a pleasure to hear Roy perform it on this DVD.  It is a very difficult number to do both musically and vocally.  All in all I enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it to any Roy Orbison fan, young or old.",5,"Long Live ""The Big O""",1104537600,"01 1, 2005",2005,1032,"['Fortunately', 'Big', 'O', 'was', 'alive', 'had', 'honor', 'seeing', 'live', 'four', 'times', 'DVD', 'copy', 'Live', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'Roy', 'crowd', 'same', 'way', 'when', 'saw', 'everything', 'off', 'very', 'slow', 'easy', 'time', 'out', 'Crying', 'crowd', 'eating', 'hand', 'screaming', 'more.I', 'found', 'DVD', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'only', 'black', 'mark', 'early', 'DVD', 'seem', 'be', 'problems', 'focusing', 'stage', 'right', 'camera', 'made', 'scenes', 'appear', 'blurry', 'times', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'close-ups', 'Roy', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'enjoying', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'how', 'little', 'effort', 'was', 'using', '10', 'octave', 'voice', 'reach', 'high', 'notes', 'became', 'legacy.Although', 'found', 'band', 'played', 'Working', 'Man', 'was', 'pleasure', 'hear', 'Roy', 'perform', 'DVD', 'very', 'difficult', 'number', 'do', 'musically', 'vocally', 'enjoyed', 'DVD', 'would', 'recommend', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'fan', 'young', 'old']",N/A
735864,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,B00008975E,Stephen Verhaeren,"[19, 38]","Don't believe everything that you hear that Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night is only live recording, and somehow this had been forgotten, and you very rarely see this play on tv. And that is a shame, since you get the chance to see Roy Orbison performing outdoors, wearing his sunglasses. On the box of this program, you get the songs that you will hear, and the musicians that you will see, and Roy Orbision is the only person that is both playing guitar, and singing. The strong and the weak points are, on is you see this program is in color and in black and white, but this program is not in Black and White. And if you want to see Roy Orbison performing in black and white, then I recommend to you that you watch Roy Orbsion and Friends: a Black and White Night. Roy Orbsion also does 2 reprises of his songs. And you don't see him breaking into guitar breaks, as much as he did in the black and white night program. The songs are in order by pefromed in the special are1. Only the Lonely2. Leah3. Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)4. In Dreams5. Mean Woman Blues6. Blue Angel7. Lana8. Blue Bayou9. Candy Man10. Crying11. Crying (Reprise)12. Ooby Dooby13. Hound Dog Man14. Working for the Man15. That Lovin' You Feelin' Again16. (Go, Go, Go) Down the Line17. It's Over18. Oh, Pretty Woman19. Running Scared20. Running Scared (Reprise)There are all the songs that you will hear in this recording, so pick up this program if you like Roy Orbsion, or even if you like Austin City Limits. But like I said, if you want to see Roy Orbison performing live in Black and White, watch the concert he did in 1987, at the since delimoshed Concut Groove.",4,Roy Orbison live in Austin City Limits,1109376000,"02 26, 2005",2005,1662,"['Do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'everything', 'hear', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'Friends', 'Black', 'White', 'Night', 'only', 'live', 'recording', 'somehow', 'had', 'been', 'forgotten', 'very', 'rarely', 'see', 'play', 'tv', 'shame', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'performing', 'outdoors', 'wearing', 'sunglasses', 'box', 'program', 'get', 'songs', 'will', 'hear', 'musicians', 'will', 'see', 'Roy', 'Orbision', 'only', 'person', 'playing', 'guitar', 'singing', 'strong', 'weak', 'points', 'are', 'see', 'program', 'color', 'black', 'white', 'program', 'not', 'Black', 'White', 'want', 'see', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'performing', 'black', 'white', 'then', 'recommend', 'watch', 'Roy', 'Orbsion', 'Friends', 'Black', 'White', 'Night', 'Roy', 'Orbsion', 'also', '2', 'reprises', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'breaking', 'guitar', 'breaks', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'black', 'white', 'night', 'program', 'songs', 'are', 'order', 'pefromed', 'special', 'are1', 'Only', 'Lonely2', 'Leah3', 'Dream', 'Baby', 'How', 'Long', 'Must', 'Dream', '4', 'Dreams5', 'Mean', 'Woman', 'Blues6', 'Blue', 'Angel7', 'Lana8', 'Blue', 'Bayou9', 'Candy', 'Man10', 'Crying11', 'Crying', 'Reprise', '12', 'Ooby', 'Dooby13', 'Hound', 'Dog', 'Man14', 'Working', 'Man15', 'Lovin', 'Feelin', 'Again16', 'Go', 'Go', 'Go', 'Down', 'Line17', 'Over18', 'Oh', 'Pretty', 'Woman19', 'Running', 'Scared20', 'Running', 'Scared', 'Reprise', 'are', 'songs', 'will', 'hear', 'recording', 'so', 'pick', 'up', 'program', 'like', 'Roy', 'Orbsion', 'even', 'like', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'said', 'want', 'see', 'Roy', 'Orbison', 'performing', 'live', 'Black', 'White', 'watch', 'concert', 'did', '1987', 'delimoshed', 'Concut', 'Groove']",N/A
