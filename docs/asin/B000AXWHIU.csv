At one point I thought it was titled pioneers of vaudeville, not prime time television. Where are the producers, the directors, the technology?  Where are the great children's shows and the adventure shows?  This documentary is nice as far as it goes, but it does not go very far at all.  In fact any number of 1920s, 30s and 40s musicals had more about the anticidents of prime time television then this documentary did.

934206,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AXWHIU,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[17, 17]","The television documentary Pioneers of Primetime informs the audience about emergence of primetime broadcasting and its founders.  These pioneers were characters such as Steve Allen, Milton Berle, Sid Caesar, Sammy Davis Jr., Buddy Ebsen, Bob Hope, Rose Marie, Donald O'Connor, and Red Skelton who helped shape what television is today.The 1930s was the decade of the radio, as it had a large number of celebrities performing audio theatrical plays and comedies.  However, the radio began to fade out of its stardom when the television seized its grip of the American population through shows such as Red Skelton Revue, Love Lucy, and The Milton Berle Show.  These shows spread the word of the television, as these new TV stars awakened the curiosity within millions of Americans.  Their performances, simply put, vastly increased the television sales, as countless people had the desire to experience these shows.With the increasing attention for television, the new market demanded more talent, which they drew from the radio programs and vaudeville shows.  These groundbreakers in network televisions were threading on never before explored territory, as they simply brought their talents and skills to the television world.  They prepared in the same manner while their audience grew from what possible on stage.  In addition, the ability to have moving images together with the sound pushed radio aside while ever-growing dedicated viewers sat down in front of their small televisions with TV dinners.It was a time before Teleprompters and taped programming.  These were the days when TV comedians and stars were under the gun of live television during each and every episode.  Careful and rigorous rehearsals helped provide the TV audience with the best possible entertainment during television's toddler stage.  It was a time when the pioneers were new to the TV phenomenon while they laid down the grunt work for the coming generations such as Seinfeld, Cheers, and Hill Street Blues.  This made-for-TV documentary offers a truly astonishing view of the early days of television, and its impact on the contemporary TV culture.",4,Fascinating Television Documentary of TV's Forerunners...,1132617600,"11 22, 2005",2005,2134,"['television', 'documentary', 'Pioneers', 'Primetime', 'audience', 'emergence', 'primetime', 'broadcasting', 'founders', 'pioneers', 'were', 'characters', 'such', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr.', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'Red', 'Skelton', 'who', 'helped', 'shape', 'what', 'television', 'today.The', '1930s', 'was', 'decade', 'radio', 'had', 'large', 'number', 'celebrities', 'performing', 'audio', 'theatrical', 'plays', 'comedies', 'However', 'radio', 'began', 'fade', 'stardom', 'when', 'television', 'seized', 'grip', 'American', 'population', 'shows', 'such', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Revue', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Show', 'shows', 'spread', 'word', 'television', 'new', 'TV', 'stars', 'awakened', 'curiosity', 'millions', 'Americans', 'performances', 'simply', 'put', 'vastly', 'increased', 'television', 'sales', 'countless', 'people', 'had', 'desire', 'experience', 'shows.With', 'increasing', 'attention', 'television', 'new', 'market', 'demanded', 'more', 'talent', 'drew', 'radio', 'programs', 'vaudeville', 'shows', 'groundbreakers', 'network', 'televisions', 'were', 'threading', 'never', 'explored', 'territory', 'simply', 'brought', 'talents', 'skills', 'television', 'world', 'prepared', 'same', 'manner', 'audience', 'grew', 'what', 'possible', 'stage', 'addition', 'ability', 'have', 'moving', 'images', 'together', 'sound', 'pushed', 'radio', 'aside', 'ever-growing', 'dedicated', 'viewers', 'sat', 'down', 'front', 'small', 'televisions', 'TV', 'dinners.It', 'was', 'time', 'Teleprompters', 'taped', 'programming', 'were', 'days', 'when', 'TV', 'comedians', 'stars', 'were', 'gun', 'live', 'television', 'episode', 'Careful', 'rigorous', 'rehearsals', 'helped', 'provide', 'TV', 'audience', 'best', 'possible', 'entertainment', 'television', 'toddler', 'stage', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'pioneers', 'were', 'new', 'TV', 'phenomenon', 'laid', 'down', 'grunt', 'work', 'coming', 'generations', 'such', 'Seinfeld', 'Cheers', 'Hill', 'Street', 'Blues', 'made-for-TV', 'documentary', 'truly', 'astonishing', 'view', 'early', 'days', 'television', 'impact', 'contemporary', 'TV', 'culture']",N/A

934208,A3CDR7VEX55JAD,B000AXWHIU,"Red Wood ""critic""","[20, 23]","As the other reviews detail, this is a basic(VERY basic) overview of a few of the vaudevillians that started the TV medium: Milton Berle, Red Skelton, Jack Benny, and Bob Hope. All were part of the radio medium, as well, which is discussed about as much as television in this documentary (already pushing its main subject to the side a bit). Others who primarily came from film included Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz - all, again, barely touched on here. Much historical information is missing, like Gleason's variety show that introduced ""The Honeymooners"", which is the only thing discussed here on him (yet, the original show played on TV for years, so long that when the latter show debuted on its own, it was old hat at the time & didn't last, believe it or not). Interviews with these heavyweight powerhouses of the early years sadly only primarily include Berle and Skelton, with a few statements from Hope. Sid Caesar, who is one of the few to have actually made it exclusively through the TV medium, is also interviewed(although very little, too). Others from the early years of TV who are interviewed include Buddy Ebsen (who talks about his brother/sister act from VAUDEVILLE), Sammy Davis Jr (who talks about the post-VAUDEVILLE circuit), Donald O'Connor (who seems to be more of a VAUDEVILLE historian here than anything else), Rose Marie (who talks about being a child of VAUDEVILLE), and Steve Allen (who discusses his VAUDEVILLE mother and others from the medium). As you can probably tell from all this, ""Pioneers of Prime Time"" is somewhat of a misleading title. ""Vaudeo: From Vaudeville to TV"" would have been a more realistic one. The bonus special features on the DVD are the ""extended"" interviews, which are extremely non-illuminating and worthless, as well, except for the Skelton one ... where he tells some pretty good - you GUESSED IT - vaudeville stories. However, if you're a completist on early TV-as I am-you may find some of the bits and pieces interwoven throughout somewhat interesting. For instance, the early clips of Sammy Davis, Buddy Ebsen, Bob Hope, and Donald O'Connor are from early TV programs, however quick these fly by(one can tell its kinescope, though, so these are @ least from the medium). Also, there is a decent amount of Berle from the archives & a couple quick moments from ""The Red Skelton Show"" & ""Your Show of Shows"" (with Caesar, Carl Reiner, Imogene Coca, and Howard Morris). But these are are available now on DVD under their own titles. Most of this is ironically documented on ""Vaudeville"", an impressive documentary on that topic. This is also available here on video/DVD from Amazon-and that is well worth your dollar, if you're interested in the subject. However, that literally makes ""Pioneers"" obsolete. On the topic of early TV, though, there was a broadcast years ago called ""NYTV""(New York television). It was shown in two parts and is very interesting, documenting the medium's home base in New York. It's chock full of information from all areas of the medium-news, variety, comedy, music, sports-you name it and it mentions it. I don't know of its availability, though. Also, one that I believe was a straight-to-video title was ""Legends of Comedy"". Although it focuses on classic comics from film, radio, and TV, there is, ironically, more info here on those who came from the radio and TV mediums than what can be found in this ""Pioneers"" documentary.",3,"Just the facts, Ma'am, just the facts",1190937600,"09 28, 2007",2007,3439,"['other', 'reviews', 'detail', 'basic', 'VERY', 'basic', 'overview', 'few', 'vaudevillians', 'started', 'TV', 'medium', 'Milton', 'Berle', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Jack', 'Benny', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'were', 'part', 'radio', 'medium', 'as', 'well', 'discussed', 'as', 'much', 'television', 'documentary', 'already', 'pushing', 'main', 'subject', 'side', 'bit', 'Others', 'who', 'primarily', 'came', 'film', 'included', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnaz', 'again', 'barely', 'touched', 'here', 'Much', 'historical', 'information', 'missing', 'Gleason', 'variety', 'show', 'introduced', 'Honeymooners', 'only', 'thing', 'discussed', 'here', 'yet', 'original', 'show', 'played', 'TV', 'years', 'so', 'long', 'when', 'latter', 'show', 'debuted', 'own', 'was', 'old', 'hat', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'believe', 'not', 'Interviews', 'heavyweight', 'powerhouses', 'early', 'years', 'sadly', 'only', 'primarily', 'include', 'Berle', 'Skelton', 'few', 'statements', 'Hope', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'who', 'one', 'few', 'have', 'actually', 'made', 'exclusively', 'TV', 'medium', 'also', 'interviewed', 'very', 'little', 'too', 'Others', 'early', 'years', 'TV', 'who', 'are', 'interviewed', 'include', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'who', 'brother/sister', 'act', 'VAUDEVILLE', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Jr', 'who', 'post-VAUDEVILLE', 'circuit', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'who', 'be', 'more', 'VAUDEVILLE', 'historian', 'here', 'anything', 'else', 'Rose', 'Marie', 'who', 'being', 'child', 'VAUDEVILLE', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'who', 'VAUDEVILLE', 'mother', 'others', 'medium', 'can', 'probably', 'tell', 'Pioneers', 'Prime', 'Time', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'title', 'Vaudeo', 'Vaudeville', 'TV', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'realistic', 'one', 'bonus', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'are', 'extended', 'interviews', 'are', 'extremely', 'non-illuminating', 'worthless', 'as', 'well', 'Skelton', 'one', 'where', 'pretty', 'good', 'GUESSED', 'IT', 'vaudeville', 'stories', 'However', ""'re"", 'completist', 'early', 'TV-as', 'am-you', 'may', 'find', 'bits', 'pieces', 'interwoven', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'instance', 'early', 'clips', 'Sammy', 'Davis', 'Buddy', 'Ebsen', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Donald', ""O'Connor"", 'are', 'early', 'TV', 'programs', 'however', 'quick', 'fly', 'one', 'can', 'tell', 'kinescope', 'though', 'are', '@', 'least', 'medium', 'Also', 'decent', 'amount', 'Berle', 'archives', 'couple', 'quick', 'moments', 'Red', 'Skelton', 'Show', 'Show', 'Shows', 'Caesar', 'Carl', 'Reiner', 'Imogene', 'Coca', 'Howard', 'Morris', 'are', 'are', 'available', 'now', 'DVD', 'own', 'titles', 'Most', 'ironically', 'documented', 'Vaudeville', 'impressive', 'documentary', 'topic', 'also', 'available', 'here', 'video/DVD', 'Amazon-and', 'well', 'worth', 'dollar', ""'re"", 'interested', 'subject', 'However', 'literally', 'Pioneers', 'obsolete', 'topic', 'early', 'TV', 'though', 'was', 'broadcast', 'years', 'ago', 'called', 'NYTV', 'New', 'York', 'television', 'was', 'shown', 'two', 'parts', 'very', 'interesting', 'documenting', 'medium', 'home', 'base', 'New', 'York', 'chock', 'full', 'information', 'areas', 'medium-news', 'variety', 'comedy', 'music', 'sports-you', 'name', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'availability', 'though', 'Also', 'one', 'believe', 'was', 'straight-to-video', 'title', 'was', 'Legends', 'Comedy', 'classic', 'comics', 'film', 'radio', 'TV', 'ironically', 'more', 'info', 'here', 'who', 'came', 'radio', 'TV', 'mediums', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Pioneers', 'documentary']",N/A
