727409,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00007ELDE,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","A film that was completely ahead of it's time; `Victim' still remains relevant today.  The fact remains that despite the change in societal toleration, much like the racial prejudice that stains the innards of our country, gay relationships will always be a controversial subject.  In a time when that issue was barely being spoken of, director Basil Dearden attempted to shed light on the matter with this 1961 thriller about a lawyer facing his past when a dear friend takes his own life.The film opens with that friend, Barrett, running from the cops.  He's not being pursued for his sexual preference, although the anti-sodomy laws would have permitted that.  Instead, Barrett is being accused of embezzlement.  When he is caught, he hangs himself.  He is hiding something that is almost immediately observed.  Barrett embezzled the money to pay off a blackmailer threatening to expose his lifestyle to the feds.  Soon Melville Farr, a successful lawyer and former friend of the deceased, is contacted.  Initially hesitant, Farr is softened by the news that this man is now dead.  Insistent on bringing a sense of justice to his friend, Farr uncovers the ring of blackmailers targeting gay men in Great Britain.  This move is a tricky one, for his whole life hangs in the balance now.  If Melville's past is exposed and he is identified for his true feelings, he would lose his wife and his career.But, the love he had for a man he refused to help overrides concern for self.Truth can be found in complaints that this film can seem stilted in moments and it's handling of the gay theme can seem slightly misinformed, but these traits should be (and can easily be) forgiven when you consider what this film stands for.  It is the first English language film to tackle this theme so extensively.  For the time in which this was released, it really `went for it'.  Foreign language films had the audacity to broach these themes for years before `Victim' was conceived, but `Victim' marks a drastic change in cinematic tolerance.  It makes a bold and daring observation and points a finger in the direction of the viewer, challenging your own ideals.  No matter how you feel when all is said and done, `Victim' should be respected for taking that leap.The performances found here are mostly all fantastic.  Dirk Bogarde is marvelous here.  The way he quietly festers under Melville's skin is sensational.  The subtle glimmers of his inner torment are seen in every frame as he embodies this man from the inside out.  Another standout here is Sylvia Syms, who is just superb as Melville's wife Laura.  The way she handles the truth is sensationally captured.  You can see her crumble inside.  It is such a soft and delicate performance, sending shivers down the spine of the audience.Basil Dearden's slick direction is also to be singled out.  The way he crafted this film as a taut thriller and a rich character study is outstanding.  By creating the layered tension he made the film something easier to digest, yet it also exemplified the importance of the message he was relaying.In the end I highly recommend this film.  It sent shockwaves through the world (it was even banned in the states) but its presence can still be felt, and that says multitudes for what it has accomplished.",5,Everybody has secrets...,1300320000,"03 17, 2011",2011,3286,"['film', 'was', 'completely', 'ahead', 'time', 'Victim', 'still', 'relevant', 'today', 'fact', 'change', 'societal', 'toleration', 'much', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'innards', 'country', 'gay', 'relationships', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'controversial', 'subject', 'time', 'when', 'issue', 'was', 'barely', 'being', 'spoken', 'director', 'Basil', 'Dearden', 'attempted', 'shed', 'light', 'matter', '1961', 'thriller', 'lawyer', 'facing', 'past', 'when', 'dear', 'friend', 'own', 'life.The', 'film', 'friend', 'Barrett', 'running', 'cops', 'not', 'being', 'pursued', 'sexual', 'preference', 'anti-sodomy', 'laws', 'would', 'have', 'permitted', 'Instead', 'Barrett', 'being', 'accused', 'embezzlement', 'When', 'caught', 'hiding', 'something', 'almost', 'immediately', 'observed', 'Barrett', 'embezzled', 'money', 'pay', 'off', 'blackmailer', 'threatening', 'expose', 'lifestyle', 'feds', 'Soon', 'Melville', 'Farr', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'former', 'friend', 'deceased', 'contacted', 'Initially', 'hesitant', 'Farr', 'softened', 'news', 'man', 'now', 'dead', 'Insistent', 'bringing', 'sense', 'justice', 'friend', 'Farr', 'ring', 'blackmailers', 'targeting', 'gay', 'men', 'Great', 'Britain', 'move', 'tricky', 'one', 'whole', 'life', 'hangs', 'balance', 'now', 'Melville', 'past', 'exposed', 'identified', 'true', 'feelings', 'would', 'lose', 'wife', 'career.But', 'love', 'had', 'man', 'refused', 'help', 'overrides', 'concern', 'self.Truth', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'complaints', 'film', 'can', 'seem', 'stilted', 'moments', 'handling', 'gay', 'theme', 'can', 'seem', 'slightly', 'misinformed', 'traits', 'should', 'be', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'forgiven', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'film', 'first', 'English', 'language', 'film', 'tackle', 'theme', 'so', 'extensively', 'time', 'was', 'released', 'really', 'went', 'Foreign', 'language', 'films', 'had', 'audacity', 'broach', 'themes', 'years', 'Victim', 'was', 'conceived', 'Victim', 'drastic', 'change', 'cinematic', 'tolerance', 'bold', 'daring', 'observation', 'finger', 'direction', 'viewer', 'challenging', 'own', 'ideals', 'matter', 'how', 'feel', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'Victim', 'should', 'be', 'respected', 'taking', 'leap.The', 'performances', 'found', 'here', 'are', 'mostly', 'fantastic', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'marvelous', 'here', 'way', 'quietly', 'Melville', 'skin', 'sensational', 'subtle', 'glimmers', 'inner', 'torment', 'are', 'seen', 'frame', 'man', 'inside', 'out', 'standout', 'here', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'who', 'just', 'superb', 'Melville', 'wife', 'Laura', 'way', 'truth', 'sensationally', 'captured', 'can', 'see', 'crumble', 'inside', 'such', 'soft', 'delicate', 'performance', 'sending', 'shivers', 'down', 'spine', 'audience.Basil', 'Dearden', 'slick', 'direction', 'also', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'way', 'crafted', 'film', 'taut', 'thriller', 'rich', 'character', 'study', 'outstanding', 'creating', 'layered', 'tension', 'made', 'film', 'something', 'easier', 'digest', 'also', 'exemplified', 'importance', 'message', 'was', 'relaying.In', 'end', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'sent', 'shockwaves', 'world', 'was', 'even', 'banned', 'states', 'presence', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'felt', 'multitudes', 'what', 'accomplished']",N/A
727410,A9Y947FCJZPVL,B00007ELDE,Arcadio Bolaos,"[1, 1]","Dirk Bogarde (famous for his main role inDeath in Venice) is Melville Farr, a most successful lawyer that has gained acceptance in the Chamber of Lords and is about to become a judge. He's wealthy and famous, he lives more than comfortably and he is married to a beautiful woman. Is he the perfect man? Well, he would be for any open-minded individual, but not for those of more traditional upbringing.Melville Farr defies law, his acts mock morality, and his thoughts are not of a decent nature. He is, after all, a man doomed to survive in a time in which homosexuality was a crime, a time in which exposing his true nature would have meant being imprisoned.At the beginning of the movie, a young man nicknamed 'Boy' is searching for him. He calls him constantly but the more desperate he gets in trying to reach him, the more Melville Farr eludes him. Farr has spent time with Boy, perhaps too much, and because of this intimacy he fears that he may be heinously extorted. The truth is, however, that Boy is the one being blackmailed by someone who has discovered his homosexual tendencies and has a compromising photography of the young man and the prestigious and well-respected barrister. Set in the early 60s, this film courageously denounces what could be, perhaps, one of the most unfair rules in Britain: the criminalization of homosexuality.Judith Butler studied postmodernist and poststructuralist theories to define the ""subject"" relying in linguistic terminology, not unlike what Jacques Lacan attempted while coming up with terms like the symbolic order (the system of signs and conventions that form our perception, our very reality). Compelled ""by social sanction and taboo"", society learns to discriminate those who oppose the heterosexual norms. As a result, our belief in ""natural"" behavior is really the result of a mixture of indirect and flagrant coercions. Repudiation towards gays, lesbians or bisexuals becomes necessary for the standard subject to establish ""an identification with the normative phantasm of sex"" (Undoing Gender).For Butler gender is a construction that regularly conceals its genesis. And that genesis is not physical but performative; the body becomes its gender only ""through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time"" (through a certain performativity that varies in each culture, one might add). Should we critique the assumptions of normative heterosexuality? Certainly those punitive rules (social, familial, and legal) have forced us to conform to hegemonic, heterosexual standards for identity.It's only fitting then, that the protagonist of ""Victim"" is a man of law, and through sheer performativity, in this case the kind of performativity that also sustains and nurtures the law, he will face a most difficult dilemma. After Boy's capture, police officers start investigating the origin of the extortion. As a consequence, Melville will no longer be able to ignore this situation, as he would have preferred to do. Why is this a dilemma? He can't confess to the police the fact that he had a relationship with another man, as that is forbidden. But, at the same time, he cannot let the blackmailers get away unpunished.As he starts investigating who could be responsible of blackmailing Boy, he digs deeper and deeper into London's gay scene. He meets men that sleep with men, people that forever hide in the shadows, and soon he learns that there are many homosexuals paying money to avoid being exposed.At the end, he must make a final stand. If his decision is to stop the criminals that threaten to destroy so many lives, he must first collaborate with the police and come forward embracing his true sexuality. That, of course, guarantees the end of his brilliant career, all of his professional ambitions will come to a halt should he decide to tell the truth. But at the same time, and this is most notorious, by playing by the rules, he also has the opportunity to perform in front of a jury, and as the nature of law is similar to the conformation of human habits, id est, it's prone to change and alteration, here performativity can also turn into the necessary coup de etat to vanquish a most ruthless law.""Victim"" was a brave production and a most controversial film in a difficult time, tackling an aspect of British law that would compare the simple fact of being gay to an arm robbery, thus condemning homosexuals to be locked behind bars, no matter how peaceful or harmless they could be. Butler's project has been so far to quote the law in order to reiterate and coopt its power, to expose the heterosexual matrix and to displace the effect of its necessity. If Farr decides to confess he's gay to his wife and to the world, he will have one chance, one shot at exposing the heterosexual normativity and undermine it long enough for people to accept that, perhaps, against everything they have been taught, an option different from heterosexuality might not mean the end of the world.",5,Performativity in gender roles,1318032000,"10 8,

727412,A24Z6PF3RTPDVX,B00007ELDE,D. Clancy,"[41, 42]","A landmark film in 1961, it brought homosexuality out into the open.  Well written by Janet Green and John McCormick, the plot tells of a blackmail ring that involves the lives of many ""victims"". Peter McEnery is a young gay man who is blackmailed and is desperate to avoid his blackmailers and the police.  Dirk Bogarde, in a daring move career wise, plays the closeted barrister  Melville Farr who had a brief liasion many years ago with McEnery.When McEnery needs his help, Bogarde rebuffs him which results in tragedy for the young man. As character after character become embroiled in this crime their lives start a downward spiral.  Everyone in the film becomes a victim of this heinous crime.Filmed in black and white against a grey London winter, the cinematography sets the right mood. Dirk Bogarde took quite a risk to play Melville Farr.  Homosexuality was still very taboo and could have broken his career.  Instead it opened up many more serious parts for him.  His performance is intense and very downplayed. Sylvia Syms, as his loving wife, matches Bogarde's performance in quality.  Her part could have become a bit melodramatic but Syms and director Basil Dearden avoided that pitfall.This film also reminds viewers of the narrow thinking that prevailed in the early 60's.  This was before Stonewall and Gay Liberation.  In England you could be imprisoned for many years. The law was repealed in 1966.  It is thought that this film was innovative in getting the repeal.A bonus to the DVD is an interview with Dirk Bogarde.",5,"Taut, well played film",1044230400,"02 3, 2003",2003,1539,"['landmark', 'film', '1961', 'brought', 'homosexuality', 'out', 'open', 'Well', 'written', 'Janet', 'Green', 'John', 'McCormick', 'plot', 'tells', 'blackmail', 'ring', 'lives', 'many', 'victims', 'Peter', 'McEnery', 'young', 'gay', 'man', 'who', 'blackmailed', 'desperate', 'avoid', 'blackmailers', 'police', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'daring', 'move', 'career', 'wise', 'closeted', 'barrister', 'Melville', 'Farr', 'who', 'had', 'brief', 'liasion', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'McEnery.When', 'McEnery', 'help', 'Bogarde', 'results', 'tragedy', 'young', 'man', 'character', 'character', 'become', 'embroiled', 'crime', 'lives', 'start', 'downward', 'spiral', 'Everyone', 'film', 'victim', 'heinous', 'crime.Filmed', 'black', 'white', 'grey', 'London', 'winter', 'cinematography', 'right', 'mood', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'took', 'quite', 'risk', 'play', 'Melville', 'Farr', 'Homosexuality', 'was', 'still', 'very', 'taboo', 'could', 'have', 'broken', 'career', 'Instead', 'opened', 'up', 'many', 'more', 'serious', 'parts', 'performance', 'intense', 'very', 'downplayed', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'loving', 'wife', 'Bogarde', 'performance', 'quality', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'become', 'bit', 'melodramatic', 'Syms', 'director', 'Basil', 'Dearden', 'avoided', 'pitfall.This', 'film', 'also', 'viewers', 'narrow', 'thinking', 'prevailed', 'early', '60', 'was', 'Stonewall', 'Gay', 'Liberation', 'England', 'could', 'be', 'imprisoned', 'many', 'years', 'law', 'was', 'repealed', '1966', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'innovative', 'getting', 'repeal.A', 'bonus', 'DVD', 'interview', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde']",N/A

Launay,"[1, 1]","I am writing this review during the week that the U.S. Supreme Court is hearing two landmark cases on the right of gay and lesbians to marry.  But when this film was produced, homosexuality was definitely a crime in both Britain and America.Film noir is one of my favorite genres...but, to be frank, most of the stories are somewhat far-fetched...or the characters are types, such as hard-boiled detectives, corrupt officials, and femme fatales.  Not so with this film.Arguably, this is one of the most character-driven movies in the film noir collection.  Dirk Bogarde plays a well known barrister of the upper class who has received news that he is being promoted. But alas, at the same time, he discovers that he is the subject of investigation by the police as a young man with whom he is infatuated has just hanged himself over blackmail.  Although there is ambiguity whether the barrister ever performed sex with a man, there is no denying his sexual orientation.  The news devastates his wife, utterly.What makes this film so distinctive, in my eyes, is the acting. Just about everyone in the film is so believable. Gay men are discovered in all walks of life - upper, middle, and lower class.  They are all terrified of going to jail if they are discovered for being who they are.  I would argue that some of the best portrayals are the blackmailers themselves. One of them is absolutely chilling as a sociopath. I use the word chilling because he thinks himself as so clever if he succeeds in cheating others of their fortune ..and the other villain feels totally justified in hurting homosexuals to clean society....just as anti-semites justified the deportation of Jews to death camps.The discussion about the nature of sexual orientation is very advanced for the 1960's.  This is not only a landmark film but it is one of the most intelligent on its theme. I want to add that there is no depiction of any sex in the film because the issue is homosexual nature as a crime - not homosexual acts.",5,Film Noir with a Social Message,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,2005,"['am', 'writing', 'review', 'week', 'U.S.', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'hearing', 'two', 'landmark', 'cases', 'right', 'gay', 'lesbians', 'marry', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'produced', 'homosexuality', 'was', 'definitely', 'crime', 'Britain', 'America.Film', 'noir', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'be', 'frank', 'most', 'stories', 'are', 'somewhat', 'far-fetched', 'characters', 'are', 'types', 'such', 'hard-boiled', 'detectives', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'femme', 'fatales', 'Not', 'so', 'film.Arguably', 'one', 'most', 'character-driven', 'movies', 'film', 'collection', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'well', 'known', 'barrister', 'upper', 'class', 'who', 'received', 'news', 'being', 'promoted', 'alas', 'same', 'time', 'subject', 'investigation', 'police', 'young', 'man', 'whom', 'infatuated', 'just', 'hanged', 'blackmail', 'ambiguity', 'barrister', 'ever', 'performed', 'sex', 'man', 'denying', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'news', 'wife', 'utterly.What', 'film', 'so', 'distinctive', 'eyes', 'acting', 'Just', 'everyone', 'film', 'so', 'believable', 'Gay', 'men', 'are', 'discovered', 'walks', 'life', 'upper', 'middle', 'lower', 'class', 'are', 'terrified', 'going', 'jail', 'are', 'discovered', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'would', 'argue', 'best', 'portrayals', 'are', 'blackmailers', 'One', 'absolutely', 'chilling', 'sociopath', 'use', 'word', 'chilling', 'so', 'clever', 'cheating', 'others', 'fortune', '..and', 'other', 'villain', 'feels', 'totally', 'justified', 'hurting', 'homosexuals', 'clean', 'society', '.just', 'anti-semites', 'justified', 'deportation', 'Jews', 'death', 'camps.The', 'discussion', 'nature', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'very', 'advanced', '1960', 'not', 'only', 'landmark', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'theme', 'want', 'add', 'depiction', 'sex', 'film', 'issue', 'homosexual', 'nature', 'crime', 'not', 'homosexual', 'acts']",N/A

727415,ADK833GQAFCLU,B00007ELDE,"James A. Butler ""James Butler""","[1, 1]","1961's ""Victim"" is one of those rare films that manages through its excellent dramatic performances to change the collective consciousness of society. Considered ahead of its time and a risky role for its star, Dirk Bogarde, Victim captures the agonizing choices homesexuals had to make prior to the abolishment of Britain's discriminatory sodomy laws. Notable was the fact that none of the gays depicted in the film fit the stereotypical mold of a gay man. Bogarde plays successful British Barrister Melville Farr (Attorney) married to a beautiful special needs teacher Laur (Sylvia Syms). Their world is tranquil and happy until someone from Farr's past makes a desperate attempt to contact him.

727416,A3RAWQSWAC7BWD,B00007ELDE,J. Clark,"[14, 17]","Don't let the title mislead you. Victim is about a man who is anything but helpless. Dirk Bogarde, in a career-defining role, plays a highly respected, but closeted, attorney who risks his marriage and reputation to bring to justice an elusive blackmail ring terrorizing gay men (exposure then meant not only disgrace but prison), and which caused the young man he loved to commit suicide. In the early 1960s, director Basil Dearden's Victim was perhaps the most daring film yet to appear on the British screen. A surprise hit at the box office, many regard it as the work that finally stirred Parliament to begin amending Britain's draconian laws against ""homosexual acts.""Historical importance aside, Victim still holds up as a taut and entertaining thriller, with excellent performances and some striking cinematography. After more than 40 years, actor Dirk Bogarde's protagonist remains one of the screen's few out and out gay heroes. He gives a richly nuanced, and powerful, performance. The film uses an unusual structural device: Melville Farr (Bogarde) and Jack Barrett (hauntingly played by Peter McEnery), the young man who loves him and whom he loves, never appear together onscreen. In fact, the first quarter of the film involves Jack's increasingly frantic attempts to contact the nervous Farr, who dodges him every way he can. While that ""non-meeting"" certainly upped the comfort level for many, it also provides a unique dramatic strength. Here absence is powerful in its suggestiveness. And as the film unfolds, we never forget that Farr's single-minded mission - in his role as part lovesick man, part avenging angel - is to bring to justice the blackmailers who drove Jack to kill himself.As played by the handsome Peter McEnery, Jack comes across as a likable guy, unpretentious and authentic. We never doubt his feelings for Farr, or his genuine affection for the middle-aged men in love with him. And although Jack dies within the first half hour, he dominates the film, causing not only Farr but, on some level, the audience to ask, What injustice caused this affable young man to kill himself?And that puts all of British society, both gay and straight, on trial. But it also causes the film's only dramatic limitation when, in the second half, polemics takes over. It tries to show the broad impact of homophobia on the widest possible socioeconomic range of characters, from both the straight and gay worlds. There are simply too many people, representing too many permutations of class and taste. However, there are some very powerful scenes, especially between Farr and his wife Laura (played with emotional complexity by the beautiful Sylvia Syms), as they work out the new contours of their marriage. But overall the film's second half was less effective than its first.In the opening hour, Dearden brilliantly used cinematic means - expressive lighting, slightly off-kilter compositions, propulsive narrative rhythms, and jazzy music - to explore character and theme (all captured superbly in the DVD transfer). In the first half, I saw and felt what it was like to live in that tense world, while in the second half, I heard characters tell me about it.Still, I highly recommend this film, not only for its historical importance to both GLBT cinema and rights, but because it is an engrossing, well acted and often strikingly shot film. And although the legal and social situation of GLBT people has improved markedly in the past four decades, there is still much emotional truth and insight in this landmark film.",5,"Taut, well-acted, entertaining thriller",1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,3546,"['Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'title', 'mislead', 'Victim', 'man', 'who', 'anything', 'helpless', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'career-defining', 'role', 'highly', 'respected', 'closeted', 'attorney', 'who', 'marriage', 'reputation', 'bring', 'justice', 'elusive', 'blackmail', 'ring', 'terrorizing', 'gay', 'men', 'exposure', 'then', 'meant', 'not', 'only', 'disgrace', 'prison', 'caused', 'young', 'man', 'loved', 'commit', 'suicide', 'early', '1960s', 'director', 'Basil', 'Dearden', 'Victim', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'daring', 'film', 'yet', 'appear', 'British', 'screen', 'surprise', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'many', 'regard', 'work', 'finally', 'stirred', 'Parliament', 'begin', 'amending', 'Britain', 'draconian', 'laws', 'homosexual', 'acts', 'Historical', 'importance', 'aside', 'Victim', 'still', 'up', 'taut', 'entertaining', 'thriller', 'excellent', 'performances', 'striking', 'cinematography', 'more', '40', 'years', 'actor', 'Dirk', 'Bogarde', 'protagonist', 'one', 'screen', 'few', 'out', 'gay', 'heroes', 'richly', 'nuanced', 'powerful', 'performance', 'film', 'unusual', 'structural', 'device', 'Melville', 'Farr', 'Bogarde', 'Jack', 'Barrett', 'hauntingly', 'played', 'Peter', 'McEnery', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'whom', 'never', 'appear', 'together', 'onscreen', 'fact', 'first', 'quarter', 'film', 'Jack', 'increasingly', 'frantic', 'attempts', 'contact', 'nervous', 'Farr', 'who', 'way', 'can', 'non-meeting', 'certainly', 'upped', 'comfort', 'level', 'many', 'also', 'unique', 'dramatic', 'strength', 'Here', 'absence', 'powerful', 'suggestiveness', 'film', 'unfolds', 'never', 'forget', 'Farr', 'single-minded', 'mission', 'role', 'part', 'lovesick', 'man', 'part', 'avenging', 'angel', 'bring', 'justice', 'blackmailers', 'who', 'drove', 'Jack', 'kill', 'himself.As', 'played', 'handsome', 'Peter', 'McEnery', 'Jack', 'across', 'likable', 'guy', 'unpretentious', 'authentic', 'never', 'doubt', 'feelings', 'Farr', 'genuine', 'affection', 'middle-aged', 'men', 'love', 'Jack', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'film', 'causing', 'not', 'only', 'Farr', 'level', 'audience', 'ask', 'What', 'injustice', 'caused', 'affable', 'young', 'man', 'kill', 'British', 'society', 'gay', 'straight', 'trial', 'also', 'film', 'only', 'dramatic', 'limitation', 'when', 'second', 'half', 'polemics', 'show', 'broad', 'impact', 'homophobia', 'widest', 'possible', 'socioeconomic', 'range', 'characters', 'straight', 'gay', 'worlds', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'representing', 'too', 'many', 'permutations', 'class', 'taste', 'However', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'especially', 'Farr', 'wife', 'Laura', 'played', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'beautiful', 'Sylvia', 'Syms', 'work', 'out', 'new', 'contours', 'marriage', 'overall', 'film', 'second', 'half', 'was', 'less', 'effective', 'first.In', 'opening', 'hour', 'Dearden', 'brilliantly', 'used', 'cinematic', 'means', 'expressive', 'lighting', 'slightly', 'off-kilter', 'compositions', 'propulsive', 'narrative', 'rhythms', 'jazzy', 'music', 'explore', 'character', 'theme', 'captured', 'superbly', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'first', 'half', 'saw', 'felt', 'what', 'was', 'live', 'tense', 'world', 'second', 'half', 'heard', 'characters', 'tell', 'it.Still', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'historical', 'importance', 'GLBT', 'cinema', 'rights', 'engrossing', 'well', 'acted', 'often', 'strikingly', 'shot', 'film', 'legal', 'social', 'situation', 'GLBT', 'people', 'improved', 'markedly', 'past', 'four', 'decades', 'still', 'much', 'emotional', 'truth', 'insight', 'landmark', 'film']",N/A

Michael Click,"[10, 11]","A groundbreaking film in its day because of its sympathetic treatment of homosexual themes, ""Victim"" may have lost some of its provocative edge, but it nonetheless remains a sophisticated and engrossing mystery.  Both its plot and its political bent are neatly encapsulated in a line of dialogue near the end of the movie when one of the characters sagely notes that the British laws criminalizing consenting homosexual behavior provide a breeding ground for blackmailers.  The story concerns a closeted and married barrister (Dirk Bogarde in a powerful and richly nuanced performance) who determines to bring the extortionists who were indirectly responsible for a former lover's suicide to justice, despite the attendant risks to his own career, social position, and marriage.  His search through an underground London populated by blackmailers, their accomplices (both willing and unwitting), their victims, and the police is paralleled by his own emotional journey toward personal truth and self-understanding.The Home Vision Entertainment release of this minor classic is far from perfect.  Mastered from a print in the Janus Films collection, there are two major and very distracting breaks in the video that might easily have been repaired with minimum effort.  And although the aspect ratio is indeed 1.66:1 as advertised, the film is not letterboxed; therefore, unless you own a widescreen television set, you will be viewing a print that appears to be full-frame but is in fact compressed from side-to-side, making the actors and sets appear unnaturally tall and narrow.  Finally, the soundtrack is sometimes muddy and/or marked by background hiss that makes small stretches of dialogue incomprehensible.  On the plus side, the DVD does include the Original Theatrical Trailer; brilliant and thoughtful liner notes by film historian David Thomson; and (best of all) a 1961 televison interview with Bogarde in which the actor offers insights into his career to date, as well as his thoughts on the pending theatrical release of ""Victim"".

727419,A2VP5OOKKLLCPV,B00007ELDE,"Julie Vognar ""Julie""","[25, 25]","Victim (1961)BY ROGER EBERT / May 23, 2004Recent critics find ""Victim"" timid in its treatment of homosexuality, but viewed in the context of Great Britain in 1961, it's a film of courage. How much courage can be gauged by the fact that it was originally banned from American screens simply because it used the word ""homosexual."" To be gay was a crime in the United States and the U.K., and the movie used the devices of film noir and thriller to make its argument, labeling laws against homosexuality ""the blackmailer's charter."" Indeed, 90 percent of all British blackmail cases had homosexuals as victims.The defense of homosexuality was not a popular topic at the box office when the film was made, and director Basil Dearden tried to broaden the film's appeal by making it into a thriller and a police procedural. There is no sex on (or anywhere near) the screen, and while the hero is homosexual by nature, there is doubt that he has ever experienced gay sex. The plot hinges on anonymous blackmailers who collect regular payments from wealthy and famous gays, and on the decision of a prominent barrister to stand up to them.This man is Melville Farr, who at the young age of 40 has just been offered the opportunity to become a Queen's Counselor. He will lose that appointment, his career and his marriage if he's identified in the press as gay, and yet he decides that someone must stand up to the blackmailers to demonstrate the injustice of the law. As he tracks the blackmailers through a network of their victims, the movie follows him through the London of the time -- its courts of law, police stations, pubs, clubs, barbershops, used bookstores, cafes, drawing rooms, car dealerships -- showing how ordinary life is affected in countless ways by the fact that many of its citizens must keep their natures a secret.Farr was played by Dirk Bogarde, as a smooth, skilled barrister who projects a surface of strength and calm. He only raises his voice two or three times in the movie, but we sense an undercurrent of anger: He finds it wrong that homosexuality is punished, wrong that gays cannot go to the police to complain of blackmail, wrong that hypocrisy flourishes. There is a moment in the movie when he unexpectedly hits someone who has just insulted him, and it comes as a revelation: Beneath his silky persona is a wound, a resentment, and a fierce determination to act at last on his convictions.The opening sequences of the film involve him only slightly, as we follow a young man named Jack Barrett (Peter McEnery), on the run from the police. We learn fairly soon that he is gay, but only gradually do we understand he is wanted for embezzlement. Broke, desperate for the money to get out of London, he calls Farr, is rebuffed, and is also turned away by a book dealer (Norman Bird), a car dealer and others. His desperation is closely observed in a pub where many of the characters hang out, including an odd couple: a ratlike little man and his heftier companion, who is blind but hears all the gossip.Barrett is arrested, and found with a scrapbook of clippings about Farr. To the almost unconvincingly wise and civilized Detective Inspector Harris (John Barrie), it's an open-and-shut case: Barrett has no money, lived simply, had stolen thousands from his employer, seemed gay, and therefore was a blackmail victim. He calls in Farr, who offers no help, but when Harris tells him that the young man has hanged himself in his cell, Farr is deeply shaken. He has good reason: He loved Barrett.His wife Laura (Sylvia Syms) immediately reads his mood and eventually learns of his friendship with Barrett. She knew when they married that he'd had a youthful infatuation with a fellow Cambridge student, but that it was ""behind him."" He never had sex with Barrett, he tells her, and stopped seeing the young man when he sensed their feelings were growing too strong -- but for her it's as much of a betrayal as physical contact, because he shows that what he felt for Barrett was different, more powerful, than what he feels for her.The movie proceeds on two levels, as a crime thriller and as a character study, and it's this dual nature that makes it an entertainment at the same time it works as a message picture. There's a good deal of indirection in the clever script, which conceals motives, misdirects our suspicions, misleads our expectations, and finds truth and dignity in the scenes between Farr and his wife; what a relief that their powerful last scene together ends on a note of bleak realism rather than providing some kind of artificial release.The movie, written by Janet Green and John McCormick, plays out primarily in a series of dialogue scenes, made rich by the gallery of British character actors who inhabit them. The best is Norman Bird, as the used-book dealer, who turns Barrett away but whose feelings about him (and Farr, as it turns out) are more complicated than it seems.The book man is one of the contacts Farr calls on in his own investigation; working with a few names supplied by one of Barrett's straight friends, he tries to get someone to say how and when he makes blackmail payments. Almost all the victims are afraid to, and one, an elderly barber named Henry (Charles Lloyd Pack), fiercely tells Farr he has been to prison twice because of his nature, and does not intend to go again.The photography places this action colorfully within a living, breathing London; it has a feel for the way its characters live and speak. For Pauline Kael, the British speech mannerisms of some of the characters made them seem, to her, more gay than the low-key Bogarde, and indeed we cannot always guess who is hunter and who is quarry. There is a subtle subplot, for example, suggesting that one of the policemen on the case may be gay himself.For Dirk Bogarde (1921-1999), the role in ""Victim"" provided a decisive break in his career. He'd been a popular leading man in the 1950s, playing conventional action and romantic roles and even making those ""Doctor"" comedies (""Doctor in the House,"" ""Doctor at Sea,"" and ""Doctor at Large""). To play a homosexual in 1961 would bring an end, his agent warned him, to those kinds of mainstream roles, and make him unemployable in Hollywood just at the moment when American directors were interested in him.But he went ahead anyway, just as Melville Farr did, and indeed never again appeared as a conventional male lead. That turned out, oddly, to be the key to his greatest success; at a time when his stock as a conventional leading man would probably have been falling, he was able, having broken free, to work in one challenging film after another: ""The Servant"" (1963), ""King & Country"" (1964), ""Darling"" (1965), ""Accident"" (1967), ""The Fixer"" (1968) Visconti's ""The Damned"" (1969) and ""Death in Venice"" (1971), Resnais' ""Providence"" (1977) and Fassbinder's ""Despair"" (1979).Bogarde himself was homosexual, but never made that public; even in his touching memoirs about the life and death of his partner Tony Forwood, he cast their relationship as actor and manager, not lovers. For that he has been criticized by some gay writers and activists, but consider: By accepting what looked like career suicide to star in ""Victim,"" wasn't he making much the same decision as his character Melville Farr -- to do the right thing, and accept the consequences? Didn't he, in effect, come out as an actor in that and many other roles (notably as the aging homosexual in ""Death in Venice"")? Was it anybody's business what he was, or did, in his private life? It is the argument of ""Victim"" that it was not.I met him once, on a summer afternoon in Venice when he was making the Visconti picture. We had tea in the garden of a palazzo overlooking the Guidecca Canal, and he pointed out with amusement an old lady in black who lurked behind some trees: ""That's the Contessa, who is renting this place to me and thinks I don't know that she didn't move out."" He was quiet, crisp, introverted. Not the sort of man who you could imaging making personal revelations for the delight of the press.Today, yes, things are different, but Bogarde was born in 1921, and homosexuality was only finally legalized in Britain in 1967. As an actor, he risked a great deal to take a crucial role at a time when it made a difference. And didn't he anyway, through his work, tell us whatever it was about him we thought we had the right to know?",5,"Roger Ebert, 2004: The film; Dirk Bogarde",1194393600,"11 7,

727423,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00007ELDE,Steven Reynolds,"[10, 10]","Melville Farr (Dirk Bogarde), a married and highly respected barrister on the verge of making QC, becomes embroiled in a homosexual blackmail plot when a youth he befriended is arrested and commits suicide. As Farr attempts to track down and expose the blackmailers, much to the distress of his secretly gay acquaintances and colleagues, Farr and his wife are forced to confront his own ambiguous sexuality... I hunted this film down because it came up time and again in reviews and discussions about ""Brokeback Mountain"" and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. It was apparently a pivotal moment in the history of British cinema, being the first movie to use the word ""homosexual"" let alone pitch an argument against Britain's anti-sodomy laws. That's all a bit irrelevant - almost comical - these days, and certainly no reason to bother watching this unless you're particularly interested in film history. What struck me, however, and what prompts me to recommend this film, is the way it still stands up as a dramatic thriller even today. It's beautifully paced, finely crafted in terms of shooting and editing, and the writing is marvellously fresh. It feels almost contemporary. The way the opening thirty minutes unfold are a short course in screenwriting: just enough information is revealed to keep you engaged, while enough is held back to make it intriguing. For the duration it remains true to the demands of a mystery plot. Never becoming just a social essay, it almost completely resists the urge to preach to the audience, notwithstanding the controversial topic. My only reservation is around the ending - Laura's final decision strikes me as both too needy and too generous to be quite credible.
