1144954,A2D0CM6EQ9N59J,B00143XDZ6,Jake Phillips,"[2, 2]","I admit, this is a very low budget offering. It was done as a web series, I believe. But despite the budgetary limitations, this is an almost word for word adaptation of the Dracula novel, which is a pretty impressive feat. This raises it above the budget and effects, because this was clearly a labor of love. Even the short story 'Dracula's Guest' was incorporated into the movie. So regardless of its flaws (the visual effects are not great; the acting varies) I would recommend this. Anyone can make a movie for millions of dollars - to do it for next to nothing is a lot harder, and director John Johnson deserves credit for making it work.",3,Very Faithful to Stoker,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,645,"['admit', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'offering', 'was', 'done', 'web', 'series', 'believe', 'budgetary', 'limitations', 'almost', 'word', 'word', 'adaptation', 'Dracula', 'novel', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'feat', 'budget', 'effects', 'was', 'clearly', 'labor', 'love', 'Even', 'short', 'story', ""'Dracula"", 'Guest', 'was', 'incorporated', 'movie', 'So', 'regardless', 'flaws', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'acting', 'varies', 'would', 'recommend', 'Anyone', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'millions', 'dollars', 'do', 'next', 'nothing', 'lot', 'harder', 'director', 'John', 'Johnson', 'credit', 'making', 'work']",Alucard
1144955,A8FVQNOFHLMK8,B00143XDZ6,"M.R. Loisel ""&#34;Six&#34;""","[21, 25]","I bought this because it sounded interesting, with Stoker's story brought into modern times. It surprised me because it's closer to the book than many movie versions are. It is basically a filmed version of all the characters' diaries and most of the dialogue and exposition are taken directly from the book. John Johnson, the director, who also plays the role of Quincey Morris, definitely had a feel for the original material and put a lot of thought into his film. OK, the production values aren't high and the FX aren't the greatest, but the story is there. The film was a pleasant surprise for me and I believe anyone who loves the book won't be disappointed with this retelling.",4,Closer to Stoker's story than most,1216598400,"07 21, 2008",2008,684,"['bought', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'Stoker', 'story', 'brought', 'modern', 'times', 'surprised', 'closer', 'book', 'many', 'movie', 'versions', 'are', 'basically', 'filmed', 'version', 'characters', 'diaries', 'most', 'dialogue', 'exposition', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'book', 'John', 'Johnson', 'director', 'who', 'also', 'role', 'Quincey', 'Morris', 'definitely', 'had', 'feel', 'original', 'material', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'film', 'OK', 'production', 'values', 'are', ""n't"", 'high', 'FX', 'are', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'story', 'there', 'film', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'believe', 'anyone', 'who', 'book', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'retelling']",Alucard

Starts off with ( Jonathan Harker ) going to Alucard's castle, nice start. As in the creepy original later on he's held prisioner instead of being a guest and later seeks to escape. However sorry to say what I saw later on made me think WT? it went down hill surprise it is a BUTCHERED version of and slap in the face to the awesome originalPros OConsInteraction between characters lets say weird their more like robots, it feels forced and with no feeling.
