The shows that hold up best today, after repeated viewing, are Have Gun -- Will Travel, Star Trek, and Perry Mason.  Two of the three had scripts by Gene Roddenberry.Why the great shows of the 1970s and 1980s are harder to find than the earlier shows is a mystery to me.  Where are DVDs or Blu Rays of Lou Grant, L.

Half hour shows were tightly written, well directed, morality tales with excellent actors.  You'd be hard pressed to find at tv series today that delivers as consistently good entertainment as HGWT did in its day.  My only complaint about the collection is that there were 2 copies of disc three, season one but no disc one.  I was able to purchase the episodes on disc one from ioffer.com and the entire Rifleman series with Chuck Connors for an excellent price.",5,Great series with one caveat,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,526,"['HGWT', 'was', 'terrific', 'tv', 'series', 'when', 'aired', 'late', '50', 'Half', 'hour', 'shows', 'were', 'tightly', 'written', 'well', 'directed', 'morality', 'tales', 'excellent', 'actors', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'tv', 'series', 'today', 'consistently', 'good', 'entertainment', 'HGWT', 'did', 'day', 'only', 'complaint', 'collection', 'were', '2', 'copies', 'disc', 'three', 'season', 'one', 'disc', 'one', 'was', 'able', 'purchase', 'episodes', 'disc', 'one', 'ioffer.com', 'entire', 'Rifleman', 'series', 'Chuck', 'Connors', 'excellent', 'price']",Have Gun - Will Travel:  Five Season Pack

1434977,A2W4ST4L33BWXF,B004ZQJ5DI,TheBeth,"[2, 2]","""Paladin"" means ""Vigilante Protector"" which is a good definition of this character.Paladin: I don't think you got a very good look at this gun while you had it. The balance is perfect. This trigger responds to a pressure of one ounce. If you look carefully in the barrel you'll see the lines of the rifling. It's a rarity in a hand weapon. This gun was handcrafted to my specifications and I rarely draw it unless I mean to use it. Would you care for a demonstration?My husband & I love this DVD set of ""Have Gun Will Travel"". It's the original shows plus little ""wire paladin"" options to read more about the episode's cast. This show ran from 1957 - 1963. I hope the final season (season 6) will be available on dvd when we finish watching all of these.  We're almost finished watching the first season.  My husband was a small child when this tv show originally aired & I wasn't born for another decade & don't remember any reruns so I've never seen it before.  I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoy it.  My favorite episodes always end up being the ones that were written by Gene Roddenberry (later wrote original star trek tv series).  Another option on the dvds is ""Spanish subtitles"" for the episodes.By the way, I've finally figured out from one of the episodes in season one that the show is supposed to be set in 1875.",5,Fantastic Collection,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,1335,"['Paladin', 'Vigilante', 'Protector', 'good', 'definition', 'character.Paladin', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'got', 'very', 'good', 'look', 'gun', 'had', 'balance', 'perfect', 'trigger', 'pressure', 'one', 'ounce', 'look', 'carefully', 'barrel', ""'ll"", 'see', 'lines', 'rifling', 'rarity', 'hand', 'weapon', 'gun', 'was', 'handcrafted', 'specifications', 'rarely', 'draw', 'mean', 'use', 'Would', 'care', 'demonstration', 'My', 'husband', 'love', 'DVD', 'set', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'original', 'shows', 'little', 'wire', 'paladin', 'options', 'read', 'more', 'episode', 'cast', 'show', 'ran', '1957', '1963', 'hope', 'final', 'season', 'season', '6', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'dvd', 'when', 'finish', 'watching', ""'re"", 'almost', 'finished', 'watching', 'first', 'season', 'husband', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'when', 'tv', 'show', 'originally', 'aired', 'was', ""n't"", 'born', 'decade', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'reruns', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'am', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoy', 'My', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'ones', 'were', 'written', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'later', 'wrote', 'original', 'star', 'trek', 'tv', 'series', 'option', 'dvds', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'episodes.By', 'way', ""'ve"", 'finally', 'figured', 'out', 'one', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'show', 'supposed', 'be', 'set', '1875']",Have Gun - Will Travel:  Five Season Pack
