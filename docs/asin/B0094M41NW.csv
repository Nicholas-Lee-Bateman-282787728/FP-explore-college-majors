Baima ""takedownchris""","[1, 6]","WTF......  they didnt ask me or my brother to be in this movie.  when most of the myths and legends are based on our shenanigans and tom foolery from 1998-2002 era.  we must have stole every munger rd street sign in the area.  YEAH the army trail/munger rd sign we had to lasso that thing down.  those things where total P**sy magnents.  ""owwwww youve been to munger rd"".  ""yeah baby (in bruce campbell voice) we own it"" then give sign to girl.  fortunatly for us the statute of limitations is up on that.  but also we used to hide in the woods and run out at the idiots parking by the tracks and scare them into driving off.  i actually didnt make it all the way through the movie fell asleep at a friends but looks like the dude who made it burnt it on his own computer, it was a freaking dvd-r.  jeez why didnt they go door to door in Wayne and get some loot off the rich dudes there to get the dvd's produced.  i dont think they answered the real mystery of munger rd.  WTF happened to the house that was 10 feet from the tracks in 1998 and in 1999 there was no house just demolished.

There were moments of suspense, and a few pretty creepy images. However, at least 50% of the film is so dark, you can only guess by sound effects what is happening. There are long periods where the screen is totally black. I actually thought there was something wrong with my tv. I watch movies to actually WATCH them. If I wanted radio theater, I would turn on the radio.The other, and totally unforgivable, problem with this film is the ending. I don't care if this is a spoiler: the makers of this film didn't know how to end it, so they went for the total rip-off: To Be Continued... I couldn't quite believe it. I paid $3.99 for ""To Be Continued""? I might have given it 3 stars in spite of its other failings, if it hadn't been for that outrage. I wish I had read the other reviews before I rented this.

This was a film made for less than $500,000 so you can not expect a lot. You do not see much of the hinted at violence in the film, in fact there is essentially no violence, more just low budget horror suspense, so if you want some (not many) scares but no nudity and no blood splatter, this is that sort of supernatural horror. The lead actress (Brooke Peoples) provides some nice eye candy and acts well. Bruce Davison is a well known actor and plays his role quite well.  Worth a watch, but don't expect any big budget effects.  Shot on a RED camera if I recall, so nice cinematography and color grading, as well as audio, unlike some low budget horror films.

The only girl to escape thus far was Jo, who instead of following the rail road track into town, decides to veer off into the woods, finds the creepy house, and then chooses to look inside for her boyfiend!She encounters the ""killer"" who chases her outside by the barn, where she finds her boyfriend, Corey, safe and sound - but acting too calm, too ""ok"" with everything for my liking! He then, off camera, goes to fight the ""killer,"" whereupon seemingly loses and the ""killer"" (still unseen) comes to kill Jo - but doesn't, letting her survive. But she DOES get a look at him.Come the arrival of the police, they comb the area but there's no sign of the other three teens - dead or alive - but the camcorder that one of them uses throughout to record ghostly stuff is quickly studied. It's then that, given it's last entry, the deputy asks Jo what really happened ... and as the camera turns to her, the screen goes black and the words TO BE CONTINUED come up!This film was not good enough that it needed to be a two-parter, but was just about good enough to be a solid 3 out of 5 movie for entertainment value. The acting was cheesy at the start, but once you got to know the characters you accepted their level of acting and went along for the ride, so to speak.In closing, it was co-produced by Robert Englund and his wife so that might explain a few things!
