Dizon ""John Reinhard Dizon""","[0, 0]","There's not a whole lot more to be said about the life and times of Dr. Josef Mengele, research scientist turned war hero turned concentration camp doctor turned Most Wanted Man Alive. His name is synonymous with Auschwitz and Nazi atrocities, and even Geraldo Rivera had a segment on him that renewed the cry for blood nearly four decades later. Unfortunately for the international convention of Nazi hunters, Mengele had a heart attack and drowned in South America a couple of years before Geraldo ascended the soapbox. David Frost himself became part of the posse once upon a time, and ""The Search for Mengele"" is his informative and entertaining report.There's nothing new under the sun about the Angel of Death, especially since his family and friends gave up everything once his death was finally discovered years after the fact. He was hardly the protected VIP featured in ""Boys of Brazil"", nor was he the destitute old man depicted by his intimates, though the truth probably lies somewhere in between. Frost is one of our great contemporary journalists, giving this documentary a suspenseful whodunit atmosphere taking it a step beyond the Nazi tattlers glutting the market.If you've never read the strange tale of Mengele's life and times, or if you're looking for a novel addition for your collection, ""The Search for Mengele"" is a worthwhile purchase.",5,Saying Goodbye to the Bad Guy?,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,1363,"['not', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'be', 'said', 'life', 'times', 'Dr.', 'Josef', 'Mengele', 'research', 'scientist', 'turned', 'war', 'hero', 'turned', 'concentration', 'camp', 'doctor', 'turned', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'Man', 'Alive', 'name', 'synonymous', 'Auschwitz', 'Nazi', 'atrocities', 'even', 'Geraldo', 'Rivera', 'had', 'segment', 'renewed', 'cry', 'blood', 'nearly', 'four', 'decades', 'later', 'Unfortunately', 'international', 'convention', 'Nazi', 'hunters', 'Mengele', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'drowned', 'South', 'America', 'couple', 'years', 'Geraldo', 'ascended', 'soapbox', 'David', 'Frost', 'became', 'part', 'posse', 'once', 'time', 'Search', 'Mengele', 'informative', 'entertaining', 'report.There', 'nothing', 'new', 'sun', 'Angel', 'Death', 'especially', 'family', 'friends', 'gave', 'up', 'everything', 'death', 'was', 'finally', 'discovered', 'years', 'fact', 'was', 'hardly', 'protected', 'VIP', 'featured', 'Boys', 'Brazil', 'was', 'destitute', 'old', 'man', 'depicted', 'intimates', 'truth', 'probably', 'somewhere', 'Frost', 'one', 'great', 'contemporary', 'journalists', 'giving', 'documentary', 'suspenseful', 'whodunit', 'atmosphere', 'taking', 'step', 'Nazi', 'tattlers', 'glutting', 'market.If', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'strange', 'tale', 'Mengele', 'life', 'times', ""'re"", 'looking', 'novel', 'addition', 'collection', 'Search', 'Mengele', 'worthwhile', 'purchase']",The Search for Mengele

Anyone who would rate this less than the maximum is not familiar with the topic or has an agenda. This ranks at the top of the list with &#34;Nazis: A Warning from History&#34; and the first-hand interviews with Hitler's secretary. Regarding Mengle, this program is better than the series &#34;Auschwitz&#34; in that it does not rely on any recreated scenes or third-hand commentary and is chock full of primary source material.You get to see first-hand interviews with Mangle's family members and associates and victims. It was made in the 1980s and so of course is not going to be at the standard of video and computer-generated imagery that is available today. But what you can't do today is interview all those first-hand witnesses and victims most of whom are now deceased.This is a must-see for anyone seriously interested in studying Hitler-era Nazism and the factual accounts of the actual people involved in making history -- horrific history.",5,Highly recommended.

1170088,A5GG4C0R5JZU0,B001B2E5IY,Kyle A. Herschend,"[0, 0]","Mengele committed horrific acts violating his Hippocratic Oath. There is no doubt about that. It is good to see that he and others of his type are still highlighted as the antithesis of the ideal &#34;Man of Science.&#34;But what is particularly encouraging about this film is that it doesn't heap the blame of the atrocities at Auschwitz on Mengele. His fascination with twin research actually originated with Dr. Verschuar's work. It is even possible that Verschuar encouraged Mengele to go to Auschwitz to carry out experiments on twins. Add to that the anti-Semitic propaganda that pervaded German academia during the time and you have a recipe for a twisted pursuit of scientific knowledge.  Such clarifies the depressing fact that evil notions rarely occur in a vacuum. They are inherited and taught. Mengele was a product of his education, station, race, culture. etc. And so, he was made into a man that many today consider evil. What is more is that people falsely think men like him are anomalies. At least, they would like to believe that...",4,Interesting and thought-provoking.

1170089,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B001B2E5IY,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[9, 10]","Josef Mengele (born Josef Rudolf Mengele, March 16, 1911 - February 7, 1979) ""was a German SS officer and a physician in the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. He earned doctorates in anthropology from Munich University and in medicine from Frankfurt University. He initially gained notoriety for being one of the SS physicians who supervised the selection of arriving transports of prisoners, determining who was to be killed and who was to become a forced laborer, but is far more infamous for performing human experiments on camp inmates, including children, for which Mengele was called the ""Angel of Death"". After the Second World War, Mengele maintained his complete innocence, writing `I, personally, have not killed, injured or caused bodily harm to anyone.'""Of course, we do learn about Mengele's youth, family life, medical education and his ultimate involvement at Auschwitz including his ""experiments"" especially on twins and children all in the name of developing an Aryan/German ""master race."" Nevertheless, the documentary tells Josef Mengele's story with an emphasis on his hiding in South America from Israeli and other authorities as they searched for him to prosecute him and unquestionably sentence him to death for his crimes against humanity. The filmmakers used still photos; interview footage with his son Rolf and people who sheltered Mengele when he was in South American countries; silent archival footage and more to inform the viewer about Mengele and exactly how he escaped out of Europe to South America where he hid in Buenos Aires, Paraguay and So Paulo among other locations. The escape story and route is somewhat complicated but it is all very clearly explained.The interviews with Holocaust survivors as well as Allied records concerning Nazi Germany indicate that Mengele committed such heinous crimes that he should have been captured and tried for his crimes; but we learn that he wasn't ever captured--and the reasons why he was never captured are explored.The DVD comes with some brief but informative notes and you can select chapters from the film if you wish to review just a few portions of the movie. True, there could have been more extras; but then again the film is so educational this becomes a minor quibble.The Search for Mengele is a well done documentary about the life of a man who willfully committed atrocious crimes against humanity only to deny it all forever after the Second World War.
