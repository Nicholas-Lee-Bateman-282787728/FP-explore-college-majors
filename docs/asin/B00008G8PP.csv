741942,A24ZKGYGJU5GK7,B00008G8PP,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","First off, I must warn you that this movie is extremely violent. The television show, Rurouni Kenshin (especially the edited version) can be watched by children. It is at times violent, but not graphically so and includes much comedy. This movie is NOT for children. It tries to be as realistic as possible, so when they do things like cut a man in two, you  see (and hear) basically what it would be like if a man were cut in two. It's extremely violent and graphically so. If you wish to avoid graphic violence, don't come near this film. It's easily rated R in that respect, if not NC-17.However, that aside, this film is nie on perfect. I have only seen the director's cut, so I don't know what the differences are from the original version, but this production is basically flawless. The animation is beautiful. The music is great and fits wonderfully. The dubbing is fantastic (I only watched the English dub, so I can't say much about the Japanese acting). Even the sound effects are awesome.The title is ""Samurai X"" because ADV Films couldn't legally use the Rurouni Kenshin name since Anime Works had the rights to Rurouni Kenshin, the show. This also means that the voice actors are not those of the show, but there aren't very many characters here from the show so that doesn't change much and the actors that they have do a fantastic job.As I said, the story is extremely violent, but just the same, that's not the focus of the story. Instead it focuses on Kenshin and on his choices in the time of the Revolution that lead to his becoming a Manslayer and then later to swearing never to kill again. The story mainly takes place during the time that Kenshin is the ""Manslayer in the Shadows"" and shows the events up to the point that he comes out of the shadows and into the open. The term ""manslayer"" is never actually used in this film. The Japanese term is ""hitokiri"" and at the end of the film it speaks of ""Hitokiri Battousai"" (i.e. Battousai the Manslayer). But throughout the film, Kenshin is referred to as ""The Assassin."" This greatly helped me to understand what being a manslayer means - or at least what one in the shadows is and does. I never saw a manslayer that killed lots of people as being particularly bad. It's war, that happens. That's what the manslayer in the open is, but the manslayer in the shadows is indeed an assassin (and thus arguably a murderer) and that helped me to understand why Kenshin was so unhappy about what he had done. The story does a wonderful job of showing why Kenshin did what he did and how it affected him. The extreme violence just serves to show how nasty it really was to be a manslayer. We are left with no doubt as to who and what Kenshin was and why he did what he did.While the movie doesn't focus on the fighting, we get to see quite a bit of it and the Kenshin here pratically makes the one in the show look like a wuss. He's absolutely fantastic. About the only time in the show that he comes close to fighting at this level is when he's fighting Saito towards the beginning of the Kyoto Arc. The fight scenes are absolutely fantastic. After watching this, you'll just about have to agree with Saito that Kenshin the Wanderer is pathetic in comparison to the Battousai.And of course this film shows the events that lead him to choose to throw away his sword - or at least choose a reverse blade one - and become that Wanderer. The events at the climax of the film form the most heart-wrenching scene that I have ever seen. It is pivotal point in Kenshin's life and an event that is absolutely crucial to understanding exactly why Kenshin became the Wanderer. That scene makes it totally and utterly clear as to why Kenshin changes. The film also shows how Kenshin got his famous cross-shaped scar and it actually forms a crucial role in the story.As an interesting side note, this move really gets me interested in the history of Japan - particularly around the time of the Revolution. While the story is easily understood without understanding Japanese history, it's easy to see how crucial a role the politics of the time play on the story and how some of the events around the story would be easier to understand with a better understanding of Japanese society of the era. But as I said, the story focuses on Kenshin and understanding of the political and historical situation aren't really necessary.However, I would advise that you have read or watched through the Kyoto Arc (second season) of Rurouni Kenshin before watching this movie. I'm sure that you could enjoy it without having done so, but there are a number of small things that wouldn't make quite make as much sense and much of it would have less meaning to you. For example, seeing Saito and what he's doing means a lot more to someone who knows who and what he is from having seen are read the appropriate part of Rurouni Kenshin.If you are a true Rurouni Kenshin fan and don't mind the violence, this is a must see. As another reviewer said, you will never look at Kenshin quite the same again. This film really helps you to understand why he is the way he is.",5,"This is Battousai the Manslayer, not Rurouni Kenshin",1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,5102,"['First', 'must', 'warn', 'movie',

741943,A8YDXMFXJ4R6X,B00008G8PP,Amber,"[2, 2]","My God! I was totally blown away by this! This is the single most moving film I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of dramas. This is nothing like the Rurouni Kenshin series, as it is a lot darker, both in terms of lighting, color, and perspective. There is not a single hint of humor in it, but as the hero is a young assassin trying to come to grips with himself during the Japanese civil war, I don't see how there could be any funny parts. You WILL NOT be laughing at any point in this. IF you don't want to be in tears at the end, then don't watch this.I have been a Rurouni Kenshin fan for years, so I thought that I would give this a try for the backstory on Kenshin and his life during the Bakumatsu. I knew it would be somewhat depressing, but I was put through the emotional wringer--and loved it. Every time I watch it I cry. It is that powerful.This is the favorite in my collection. I have shown it to my mom, and she loved it as well. This is definitely for those mature people who want to see the definitive sad, moving love story. Betrayal, love, loss, pain (both physical and emotional), and ideals come into play in this wonderful film.Kenshin joins the fight against wishes of his mentor and the warnings that he will be used by those in power, who will only want him for his incredible sword skills. Sure enough, his power and skills are abused by his superiors, who put him in the position of being their primary assassin. His ideals of honor, righteousness, and loyalty are skewed by his job as a murderer, and he begins to lose himself.Enter Tomoe. She meets Kenshin by chance and begins following him around. They start to fall for each other, but there are too many secrets still hidden, and too much to overcome...I cannot stress enough just how EXCELLENT and WORLD-CLASS this film is.

Agnew ""rothwyn""","[4, 5]","This is the first taste of Rurouni Kenshin I ever experienced, and, to tell the truth, nothing save the original manga (and possibly the Shadow of the Wolf DVD) have been able to match my awe and appreciation for this masterpiece.Samurai X (and that is the ONLY time I'm going to call it that) Trust and Betrayal combines the four Kenshin OVA's into a two-hour movie that tells the story of how a small boy became the legendary Hitokiri Battousai, how it nearly destroyed him from within, and how he was saved by the woman he loved, even though he could not save her.This is a truly great anime, and is taken nearly word for word (and drawing for drawing) from Volume 19 of the RK manga, telling the story of how Shinta became Kenshin, trained under Seijuro Hiko in the arts of Hiten Mitsurugi-ryu, and lent his sword to the patriots during the time of the Bakumatsu. Here, the character interaction and development is handled with the same grace and beauty as the deadly sword combat, some of which is simply astonishingly good. And that's not to mention the superb animation work, which is probably the best in the series' history.Overall, not only is this DVD a great deal (it costs half as much as buying Trust and Betrayal seperately) but it is also deserving of a permanent place in your DVD collection.

This became the standard that I judged other animated features by in years to come. All the other reviewers will agree that this is an excellent animated feature bleeding (literally) with high production values and quality animation. The questionable computer/live work and a few freeze frame shortcut animation sequences are my only, negligable gripes.What's best about the plot is that there really is no good guy or bad guy, no cops or robbers, no cowboys and indians.  An ambiguous sense of good and evil that is very human leaves the viewers to make their own conclusions. This is art. It encourages thought and interaction. &quot;Cops and robbers&quot; is propaganda, which tells you what to think, that the cops are always the goodguys and they always have to win (Hollywood movies).The &quot;director's cut,&quot; so to speak, must be the 1 inch CUT at the top and bottom of the screen (letterboxing). There are about 10 seconds of extra footage, with the music switched and even removed in some portions. Overall, I liked trust/betrayal better, but buy this DVD as a package/cheaper deal.

How could I, coming fresh from the Rurouni Kenshin series and loving it, possibly not grab this title?Well I did, and to say that I am frankly baffled by how anime fans constantly hail it a masterpiece would be the understatement of the century. I'm sorry, but it showed no sign of greatness. Not a bit.Why? Firstly the english dub. It wasn't bad. It was painful. Dialogue was stilted and slow (this might be true of the sub too) and plain awkward. Everybody sounded bored. In a move of utter ignorance which insults the fans, nobody told the cast how to pronounce japanese words - so listen up for some hilarious cringe-worthy stinkers. Also, annoyingly the cast is different from the series dub because a different studio licensed it. You might argue this point is unfair, but it still detracted from my enjoyment to hear anyone other than the lovely Richard Hayworth handling our fearsome samurai protagonist.The story only tried to be complex to cover up the fact that it was ultimately forgettable. Why is it even in two parts?? Kenshin slashes a lot of people, meets a pretty, mysterious girl, *spoilers!!!* pretty girl betrays him, he slashes some more people, then pretty, mysterious girl predictably dies in his arms. Damn, I could not have cared less. Just why are we supposed to believe that he fell in love with Tomoe? Everything went from unemotively wooden to phony-tragic, and we are supposed to care that she died, or believe that there was chemistry between them that was never actually shown on screen? No, it doesn't work like that. Don't insult my intelligence, writers. The thing that makes me dislike Samurai X the most was that when something is good, you remember it, don't you? Like a certain scene that stays in your head? Nothing about this at all stayed with me, other than the gruesome sight of guys getting hacked in two (note - this should probably have racked up an 18 certificate, it is WAY more violent than the series). I felt nothing - not least for the Battousai, who if not for the red hair and eventual cross-shaped scar, you would not even guess was the younger version of the beloved anime hero. It is so divorced that it feels like an ill-concieved spin-off.This was something I wish I hadn't wasted money on. I'll stick with the bittersweet humour/action of the tv series anytime.",1,am I the only Kenshin fan who hated this??,1276387200,"06 13, 2010",2010,2611,"['Review', 'Samurai', 'X-', 'Trust', 'Betrayal.Wherever', 'go', 'one', 'highest', 'ratest', 'animals', 'titles', 'fans', 'choose', 'one', 'favourites', 'Anime', 'News', 'Network', 'been', 'ranked', 'top', 'ten', 'several', 'years', 'running', 'along', 'massive', 'greats', 'such', 'Death', 'Note', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'How', 'could', 'coming', 'fresh', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'series', 'loving', 'possibly', 'not', 'grab', 'title', 'Well', 'did', 'say', 'am', 'frankly', 'baffled', 'how', 'anime', 'fans', 'constantly', 'hail', 'masterpiece', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'century', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'showed', 'sign', 'greatness', 'Not', 'bit.Why', 'Firstly', 'english', 'dub', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'was', 'painful', 'Dialogue', 'was', 'stilted', 'slow', 'might', 'be', 'true', 'sub', 'too', 'plain', 'awkward', 'Everybody', 'sounded', 'bored', 'move', 'utter', 'ignorance', 'fans', 'nobody', 'told', 'cast', 'how', 'pronounce', 'japanese', 'words', 'so', 'listen', 'up', 'hilarious', 'cringe-worthy', 'stinkers', 'Also', 'annoyingly', 'cast', 'different', 'series', 'dub', 'different', 'studio', 'licensed', 'might', 'argue', 'point', 'unfair', 'still', 'detracted', 'enjoyment', 'hear', 'anyone', 'other', 'lovely', 'Richard', 'Hayworth', 'handling', 'fearsome', 'samurai', 'protagonist.The', 'story', 'only', 'tried', 'be', 'complex', 'cover', 'up', 'fact', 'was', 'ultimately', 'forgettable', 'Why', 'even', 'two', 'parts', 'Kenshin', 'lot', 'people', 'pretty', 'mysterious', 'girl', '*spoilers', '*', 'pretty', 'girl', 'betrays', 'more', 'people', 'then', 'pretty', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'predictably', 'arms', 'Damn', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'cared', 'less', 'Just', 'why', 'are', 'supposed', 'believe', 'fell', 'love', 'Tomoe', 'Everything', 'went', 'unemotively', 'wooden', 'phony-tragic', 'are', 'supposed', 'care', 'died', 'believe', 'was', 'chemistry', 'was', 'never', 'actually', 'shown', 'screen', 'No', ""n't"", 'work', 'Do', ""n't"", 'insult', 'intelligence', 'writers', 'thing', 'dislike', 'Samurai', 'X', 'most', 'was', 'when', 'something', 'good', 'remember', 'do', ""n't"", 'certain', 'scene', 'head', 'Nothing', 'stayed', 'other', 'gruesome', 'sight', 'guys', 'getting', 'hacked', 'two', 'note', 'should', 'probably', 'have', 'racked', 'up', '18', 'certificate', 'WAY', 'more', 'violent', 'series', 'felt', 'nothing', 'not', 'least', 'Battousai', 'who', 'not', 'red', 'hair', 'eventual', 'cross-shaped', 'scar', 'would', 'not', 'even', 'guess', 'was', 'younger', 'version', 'beloved', 'anime', 'hero', 'so', 'divorced', 'ill-concieved', 'spin-off.This', 'was', 'something', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'wasted', 'money', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'bittersweet', 'humour/action', 'tv', 'series', 'anytime']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal

741951,A3TKPR7PEI4F9N,B00008G8PP,Holli Castillo,"[3, 5]","Trust & Betrayal follows the life of Kenshin, from his youth as an orphan named Shinta, to his violent life as Battousai the manslayer, and then to his life as a man seeking atonement for his plentiful sins.As an orphan, he sees the murder of the people presently caring for him, and is saved from getting killed himself by the man who will become his master.  Kenshin, however, abandons his master before his training is fulfilled in order to stop a corrupt government and fight for the ""good"" guys.  He kills without feeling, suppressing his emotions and conscience, and is the most effective assassin on either side.And then he meets Tomoe, a woman everyone mistakes for a prostitute.  Unknown and unrealized to Kenshin, Tomoe is as much a pawn of the revolution as Kenshin himself is, being used by the opposition to exact revenge, as well as by his own people to ensure that he doesn't break down emotionally and become useless as a fighter.Kenshin's fiercest struggles, however, are not physical.  It is too easy for this killing machine to defeat his opponent for the fight to ever be called into question.  His struggles only truly begin when he finally lives a normal life, and starts to question why he thought he could only be happy using his sword to kill for justice, asking himself if justice can ever be exacted through murder?While the main premise of Kenshin is fascinating, the theme of atonement, and if good ends can ever be justified by evil means, my problem with the movie is that I don't think the relationship between Kenshin and Tomoe was developed enough to make me believe that Kenshin's existence with Tomoe was enough to begin his path to redemption and atonement.  While what happens at the end clearly would be a catalyst for a change, (I won't spoil it here by telling you,) I don't think I saw the type of romantic relationship between them that would make me believe they had fallen in love. I didn't see any sparks, only two people living a daily existence in a situation they were forced into.Still, the Kenshin fan must see this DVD.  It fills in the blanks as to what caused Kenshin to become the manslayer, how he got the famous X-shaped scar, and what caused him to realize he needed redemption.  It also explains why Kenshin would be hesitant to ever embark upon another serious relationship- talk about get the wool pulled over your eyes and then the rug pulled out from under your feet in a matter of hours.  I do think the relationship between Kaoru and Kenshin in the series is much more believable, because Kaoru is a character I could see Kenshin falling in love with, smart, strong, always trying to do the right thing, but still a woman who needs some protection.  I never knew Tomoe well enough to believe that Kenshin would have fallen in love with her.Kenshin fans should appreciate this movie.  The animation is slightly different, better in fact, and there is none of the sometimes over the top silliness of the series- although much of what makes Kenshin lovable in the series is his goofiness.  The movie is worth getting if for no other reason than to learn about Kenshin's past.For those who don't know Kenshin, I would probably not recommend this DVD.  You won't appreciate Kenshin without knowing his TV series personality, as his personality in the movie is a little flat and humorless, and quite a bit more serious.  I would suggest watching the first few episodes of the Kenshin series- you can buy the English dubbed versions in sets of three episodes.  I can almost guarantee you will be hooked if you do.Finally, I would recommend this DVD set over buying the movies separately.  Although my DVD didn't seem to come with any of the promised extras except previews, I liked watching the two movies as one long movie with only a second-long black screen in between them.  The DVD set could easily have been made as one movie to begin with, and probably would have in this country, as a one hour movie is unheard of in the U.S..  As an aside, the preview of Samurai X, Reflection, is compelling enough to watch over and over before you actually view the last movie of the OAV.  In fact, my kid made me play it four times in a row.I would have given this five stars, except for the problem of the lack of development of the relationship of Kenshin and Tomoe, and the fact that I don't think non-Kenshinites will be able to relate to it.",4,Must have for Kenshin fan,1073520000,"01 8, 2004",2004,4399,"['Trust', 'Betrayal', 'life', 'Kenshin', 'youth', 'orphan', 'named', 'Shinta', 'violent', 'life', 'Battousai', 'manslayer', 'then', 'life', 'man', 'seeking', 'atonement', 'plentiful', 'sins.As', 'orphan', 'murder', 'people', 'presently', 'caring', 'saved', 'getting', 'killed', 'man', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'master', 'Kenshin', 'however', 'abandons', 'master', 'training', 'fulfilled', 'order', 'stop', 'corrupt', 'government', 'fight', 'good', 'guys', 'feeling', 'suppressing', 'emotions', 'conscience', 'most', 'effective', 'assassin', 'side.And', 'then', 'Tomoe', 'woman', 'everyone', 'mistakes', 'prostitute', 'Unknown', 'unrealized', 'Kenshin', 'Tomoe', 'as', 'much', 'pawn', 'revolution', 'Kenshin', 'being', 'used', 'opposition', 'exact', 'revenge', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'people', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'emotionally', 'become', 'useless', 'fighter.Kenshin', 'fiercest', 'struggles', 'however', 'are', 'not', 'physical', 'too', 'easy', 'killing', 'machine', 'defeat', 'opponent', 'fight', 'ever', 'be', 'called', 'question', 'only', 'truly', 'begin', 'when', 'finally', 'normal', 'life', 'question', 'why', 'thought', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'happy', 'using', 'sword', 'kill', 'justice', 'asking', 'justice', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'exacted', 'murder', 'main', 'premise', 'Kenshin', 'fascinating', 'theme', 'atonement', 'good', 'ends', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'justified', 'evil', 'means', 'problem', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'relationship', 'Kenshin', 'Tomoe', 'was', 'developed', 'enough', 'make', 'believe', 'Kenshin', 'existence', 'Tomoe', 'was', 'enough', 'begin', 'path', 'redemption', 'atonement', 'what', 'end', 'clearly', 'would', 'be', 'catalyst', 'change', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'telling', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'saw', 'type', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'would', 'make', 'believe', 'had', 'fallen', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'sparks', 'only', 'two', 'people', 'living', 'daily', 'existence', 'situation', 'were', 'forced', 'into.Still', 'Kenshin', 'fan', 'must', 'see', 'DVD', 'blanks', 'what', 'caused', 'Kenshin', 'become', 'manslayer', 'how', 'got', 'famous', 'X-shaped', 'scar', 'what', 'caused', 'realize', 'needed', 'redemption', 'also', 'why', 'Kenshin', 'would', 'be', 'hesitant', 'ever', 'embark', 'serious', 'relationship-', 'talk', 'get', 'wool', 'pulled', 'over', 'eyes', 'then', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'feet', 'matter', 'hours', 'do', 'think', 'relationship', 'Kaoru', 'Kenshin', 'series', 'much', 'more', 'believable', 'Kaoru', 'character', 'could', 'see', 'Kenshin', 'falling', 'love', 'smart', 'strong', 'always', 'trying', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'still', 'woman', 'who', 'protection', 'never', 'knew', 'Tomoe', 'well', 'enough', 'believe', 'Kenshin', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'her.Kenshin', 'fans', 'should', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'animation', 'slightly', 'different', 'better', 'fact', 'none', 'sometimes', 'top', 'silliness', 'series-', 'much', 'what', 'Kenshin', 'lovable', 'series', 'goofiness', 'movie', 'getting', 'other', 'reason', 'learn', 'Kenshin', 'past.For', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Kenshin', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'wo', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Kenshin', 'knowing', 'TV', 'series', 'personality', 'personality', 'movie', 'little', 'flat', 'humorless', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'would', 'suggest', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Kenshin', 'series-', 'can', 'buy', 'English', 'dubbed', 'versions', 'sets', 'three', 'episodes', 'can', 'almost', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'hooked', 'do.Finally', 'would', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'buying', 'movies', 'separately', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'promised', 'extras', 'previews', 'liked', 'watching', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'long', 'movie', 'only', 'second-long', 'black', 'screen', 'DVD', 'set', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'one', 'movie', 'begin', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'country', 'one', 'hour', 'movie', 'unheard', 'U.S..', 'aside', 'preview', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Reflection', 'compelling', 'enough', 'watch', 'actually', 'view', 'last', 'movie', 'OAV', 'fact', 'kid', 'made', 'play', 'four', 'times', 'row.I', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'five', 'stars', 'problem', 'lack', 'development', 'relationship', 'Kenshin', 'Tomoe', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'non-Kenshinites', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'relate']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal

Not even a man of colossal power, would be able to prevent the inevitable.""Every choice has a consequence, and every action will cause a reaction that will impact you whether realize it or not, and the decisions by the characters in Trust and Betrayal, but by more importantly the legendary Himura Kenshin will shape a nation for years to come, and cause a great deal of pain and suffering in his own life. For those of you unfamiliar with the character Himura Kenshin, he is the creation of acclaimed Japanese manga artist and author Nobuhiro Watsuki. Nobuhiro Watsuki likes to use real life characters and events for his stories, and very loosely basis Himura Kenshin on Kawakami Gensai. Himura Kenshin is a former Choshu assassin said to be the greatest swordsman every, who mysteriously disappeared right after the Tokugawa Shogunate fell in 1867. The Manga takes place eleven years later in 1878 with Kamiya Kaoru searching for the legendary manslayer that has been killing innocent people and saying he was using the Kamiya Kasshin-ry&#363; style of swordsmanship. She accidently runs into a wandering swordsman with a reverse blade sword who has taken a vow to never kill again. Watsuki creatively combined the real world of late 19th century Japan with his story, and through his twenty eight volume manga, and Kenshin and Kaoru's memorable journey together Watsuki creates one of the best manga story lines ever along with some of their most well written characters ever, so it is not surprising that Studio Deen would be interesting in creating a Anime series based on the manga, which gave life to the wonderful ninety five episode anime series Rurouni Kenshin. Still there was lots of interest in Kenshin's past before the Meji Restoration while he was an assassin and Trust and Betrayal gives viewers the insight into Kenshin Himura's early years.The quote above by the character Hiko Seij&#363;r&#333; is a fitting quote for the mid-19th century Japan. The Tokugawa Shogunate had basically had absolute control of Japan for over two hundred years ruling by fear and hostage taking. That is the simplistic version, but it gets the point across. The Shogun was the voice of the Emperor and there was no dissention ever with any dissention leading to imprisonment or death. In the 19th century things began to change with the class system and the restrictions the Shogunate put on each class began to boil over, and then there was the Shogunate's policy of isolationism. Outside of the Dutch, Japan refused to have any dealings with the outside world. That quickly changed in the 18th century with Imperialism. England was had defeated China in the first Opium War, Russia was encroaching on Japan's territory and then there is the United States which had its eyes on the Pacific and Japan. This would lead to the infamous ""Black Ships"" and the arrival of Admiral Perry who forced the Shogunate to open the country to all foreign nations. This embarrassment and insult would lead civil war and the collapse of the downfall of the Shogunate as many different sides and factions fought for control of Japan, which is when Trust and Betrayal takes place.At the outset of Trust and Betrayal we follow a group of travelers traveling down small road when they are brutally attacked by bandits leaving just a small child alive, and it looks like the child will be killed along with his fellow companions when Hiko Seij&#363;r&#333; who easily dispatches with the bandits, but does not help the boy just basically saying this is life deal with it and walks away thinking nothing of the boy that is until Seij&#363;r&#333; finds the child standing in front of freshly buried graves where the boy has not only buried his companions, but also the bandits as well. Seij&#363;r&#333; agrees to take the boy on as his disciple and asks the boy his name, and in reply the child says his name is Shinta. This is the first defining moment in Shinta soon to be Kenshin's life. Through Seij&#363;r&#333; and his Hiten Mitsurugi-ry&#363; style of swordsman ship would lead Kenshin to become one of the greatest swordsman and killers ever. The second defining moment of Kenshin's young life takes place a few years after he has left Seijuro Hiko's tutelage to try and make a difference for the people and Japan where Kenshin ends up working for the Choshu clan as their best assassin. Through them he encounters Kiyosato Akira a young samurai guarding a local shogun official, and though Kenshin is victorious in killing the official and Akira, Kenshin is left scarred and the consequences of his actions would come back to haunt him. That theme is carried out throughout the OVA and impacts not only Kenshin, but all the characters in the anime. How our choices we make may not think wrong or won't impact anyone else may leave lasting and even devastating impact on those affected by those decisions along with the ones who made them. Kenshin is socially awkward having physically grown up, but not emotionally, and though he knows about the harshness of the world Kenshin is also nave when it comes to interacting with the world and trying to change it, which Seijuro tries to point out to his young pupil. Katsura Kogor&#333; the leader of the part of the Choshu clan regrettably takes advantage of this fact. The third defining moment that would influence perhaps be the greatest influence on his life and lead to his vow never to kill again is when Kenshin falls in love, but I will not give anything more away about what happens later in the OVA for those who haven't read the manga any of the anime series or films, but like Nobuhiro Watsuki did with the manga Studio Deen and writer Masashi Sogo creates a beautiful Greek Tragedy that again creatively combines historical events in Japan with the story of Kenshin to create a tragic, heart wrenching and truly emotionally satisfying anime OVA that can stand against any live action or anime film, TV series or OVA.The animation is somewhat outdated by todays standard of animation, but it isn't that noticeable and Trust and Betrayal is beautifully animated with great painstaking detail put into each character and scene. The action in Trust and Betrayal is riveting and violent, which is a testament to Studio Deen's historical detail, and the scenes were brilliantly planned out and animated. The OST was created by Taku Iwasaki who compiles a dramatic and movie score highlighted by ""The Wars of the Last Wolves"" and ""In Memories 'A Boy Meets the Man'"" that compliments and the action and emotional moments of the anime scenes, and creating one of the most beautiful anime soundtracks around. I am not really a big fan of dubbed anime films or films in general as I prefer subtitles, but the English voice actors do a relatively good job with the film as did the translators, so I don't think it will effect anyone viewer if they watched it dubbed or with subtitles.There are many quality anime films, series and OVA's around, but few have true meaning behind their stories or successfully delivers their message. I can think of a few like Now and Then/Here and There, Kino's Journey and Fullmetal Alchemist to name of a few. Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal is another. The historical OVA perfectly blends the turbulent times of mid-18th century Japan and fiction to create an exceptional heart wrenching tale about the consequences of our actions and how killing isn't the answer to resolving conflicts, and how death slowly eats away out the soul of the killer, and that along with dated, but still wonderful animation, great action and beautiful music. You don't have to know anything about the character Himura Kenshin or have read the Manga as Trust and Betrayal is an origin story, which makes Trust and Betrayal a must for any anime fan or anyone who is a fan of cinema, for you must experience the birth of one of the greatest and well written characters ever created.",5,Every choice has a consequence.,1370995200,"06 12,

741955,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00008G8PP,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[0, 0]","SAMURAI X is probably better referred to as the OAVs for a popular franchise called RURONI KENSHIN, as some fans detested the retitling of this four-part very much adult drama Anime. I am not a huge fan of samurai-inspired flicks with blood-spurting violence (NINJA SCROLL gave me a huge stomach ache from its opening sequence of men getting sawed in half and/or ripped of their arms), nor did I ever see the TV show that this show is inspired from, however, this story about a young assassin whose murderous ways are transformed by his dealings with a beautiful woman (whose husband-to-be he unknowingly killed) is surprisingly decent. The animation is spectacular, rivaling that of Miyazaki's best works, and the characterizations are complex and deep. The OAVs were made after the TV show of the same title, however, this 2-hour tale is far from the lightheartedness of that show. This is a dark, brooding, and emotionally gripping effort that could almost be passed off as a live-action movie. In addition to which this is not a story for young children; there is plenty of violence and, yes, bloodspurting -- and some of the killings are often brutal to watch. However, the violence is artistically portrayed without ever being gratuitous, pretty much in the same treatment as PRINCESS MONONOKE. And I was very much moved rather than sickened by the time this show came to a close; it's no wonder SAMURAI X has such a loyal following.I do not own this title; I merely watched it at an Anime club at college. The version I saw was dubbed (and not the ""Director's Cut"" as this title is labeled; just the four uncut OAVs). Considering that this dub was recorded by Monster Island Studios, who made the wonderful dub for NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER, this dub for SAMURAI X sadly doesn't reach the same level of that former title. I cannot comment on any ""rewrites"", since I was unable to watch the subtitles. I will say, however, that the cast could have done a much better job. The problem isn't that the characters aren't well-voiced -- for the most part, the voices suit the characters quite well -- but the actors sound too much like they are just reading words instead of sinking into character. SAMURAI X's dub is not as horrendous as some purists scream, but it doesn't rank up with the better ones either.That said, the colors on the DVD looked sharp and crisp, probably even better than the only ADV titles on DVD that I own (NADIA, EVANGELION). I don't think I'll add this title to my collection, but I do not at all regret watching it once at an Anime club. In fact, (despite the okay but not great dub) this title passes as a highly recommended title to watch, if but for the beautiful artistry.",4,"Bloody & violent, yet beautiful & well-told samurai drama.",1049673600,"04 7, 2003",2003,2712,"['SAMURAI', 'X', 'probably', 'better', 'referred', 'OAVs', 'popular', 'franchise', 'called', 'RURONI', 'KENSHIN', 'fans', 'detested', 'retitling', 'four-part', 'very', 'much', 'adult', 'drama', 'Anime', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'samurai-inspired', 'flicks', 'blood-spurting', 'violence', 'NINJA', 'SCROLL', 'gave', 'huge', 'stomach', 'ache', 'opening', 'sequence', 'men', 'getting', 'sawed', 'half', 'and/or', 'ripped', 'arms', 'did', 'ever', 'see', 'TV', 'show', 'show', 'inspired', 'however', 'story', 'young', 'assassin', 'murderous', 'ways', 'are', 'transformed', 'dealings', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'husband-to-be', 'unknowingly', 'killed', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'rivaling', 'Miyazaki', 'best', 'works', 'characterizations', 'are', 'complex', 'deep', 'OAVs', 'were', 'made', 'TV', 'show', 'same', 'title', 'however', '2-hour', 'tale', 'far', 'lightheartedness', 'show', 'dark', 'brooding', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'effort', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'passed', 'off', 'live-action', 'movie', 'addition', 'not', 'story', 'young', 'children', 'plenty', 'violence', 'yes', 'bloodspurting', 'killings', 'are', 'often', 'brutal', 'watch', 'However', 'violence', 'artistically', 'portrayed', 'ever', 'being', 'gratuitous', 'pretty', 'much', 'same', 'treatment', 'PRINCESS', 'MONONOKE', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'moved', 'rather', 'sickened', 'time', 'show', 'came', 'close', 'wonder', 'SAMURAI', 'X', 'such', 'loyal', 'following.I', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'title', 'merely', 'watched', 'Anime', 'club', 'college', 'version', 'saw', 'was', 'dubbed', 'not', 'Director', 'Cut', 'title', 'labeled', 'just', 'four', 'uncut', 'OAVs', 'Considering', 'dub', 'was', 'recorded', 'Monster', 'Island', 'Studios', 'who', 'made', 'wonderful', 'dub', 'NADIA', 'SECRET', 'OF', 'BLUE', 'WATER', 'dub', 'SAMURAI', 'X', 'sadly', ""n't"", 'reach', 'same', 'level', 'former', 'title', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'rewrites', 'was', 'unable', 'watch', 'subtitles', 'will', 'say', 'however', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'problem', ""n't"", 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'well-voiced', 'most', 'part', 'voices', 'suit', 'characters', 'quite', 'well', 'actors', 'sound', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'just', 'reading', 'words', 'instead', 'sinking', 'character', 'SAMURAI', 'X', 'dub', 'not', 'as', 'horrendous', 'purists', 'scream', ""n't"", 'rank', 'up', 'better', 'ones', 'said', 'colors', 'DVD', 'looked', 'sharp', 'crisp', 'probably', 'even', 'better', 'only', 'ADV', 'titles', 'DVD', 'own', 'NADIA', 'EVANGELION', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'add', 'title', 'collection', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'watching', 'once', 'Anime', 'club', 'fact', 'okay', 'not', 'great', 'dub', 'title', 'highly', 'recommended', 'title', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'artistry']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal

The best of the three would have to be Betrayal, the other two have horrible voice acting and they're still good but Betrayal outshines them both. In Betrayal you get what every fan wants to know and that's Kenshins past and the story of how he got that crossed shaped scarr.I truly love this Reflection and even though it is very good I can't escape the fact that these characters do not seem to be the same. Karou was not herself in reflection I know her love was deep for Kenshin but she seemed unreal, her love was deep for him in the series but she was still the funny, joyful, loud swordswoman she always was but with more love in her heart because of Kenshin. The same with Yahiko Megumi and Sanoske.It felt like Karou turned into Tomo Kenshins first wife, a soft-spoken loving caring wife who would never leave Kenshins side.I'm very sure Karou would become something like Tomo but in her own way. Plus after what happened in the series with Yahiko taking kenshins sword to fight Gohei Hiruma the crazed idiot who would stop at nothing to kill Kenshin for breaking his thumb it looked as if Kenshin would never let Yahiko touch the reverse blade sword again. To end this it's hard to believe that all of the characters hardcore Rurounie Kenshin fans have come to love could change so much. In a way I don't know these people but overall reflection is a good story sad but good and the big change is it's only downfall.

The animation is so good that I stopped the film in parts to debate with myself whether or not they used actual photographs of blossoms and trees and meadows. The bloodshed is brief, but dreadfully graphic and expressive of the cruelty that had taken over Kenshin's mind before he met Tomoe. And the love story of Kenshin and Tomoe was so deeply thought-provoking that I don't think I will ever stop coming back to it.It helps to be familiar with the manga and/or anime before watching this film, but I think it could be equally rewarding to go on to the rest of Kenshin's story and see how it ends. I personally don't bother with Samurai X: Reflection, because it was not written by the creator of Kenshin, Nobuhiro Watsuki. He checked the script but did not like it and it is not considered canon. I prefer the way Watsuki ended the manga, with Kenshin happy with his family and friends. But this movie, although so dark and tragic, is worth seeing and will definitely give an added depth to the later story of Kenshin.Other reviewers have advised avoiding the English dub, but I would advise the opposite. I never would have thought voice actors could be so evocative of the story-certainly they are important, but I was blown away by the English cast, particularly J Shannon Weaver, who voiced Kenshin. He made Kenshin's voice so flat and expressionless in the beginning, then you could hear Kenshin coming to life in the little mountain home he shared with Tomoe. After her death, the flatness was back in Kenshin's voice, but you could also hear the pain in every word. What an amazing job this man did-I would definitely recommend giving the English dub a chance.All in all, this is a movie that can stand on its own as a great piece of art and I would rank it among the greatest movies of all time. When something is this beautiful and thoughtful, the form doesn't matter. All that matters is the feeling it gives you.

But in parts of the movie they'll combine real-life footage and animated footage together.Audio-wise, the movie really excels to it's limits comapered to the series.  The music was very well chosen to progress the story, as was the sound effects.  The voice acting was very good, except for some weak lines.The are no special features on the DC version, except for the extended scenes that are already put into the movie.The down part about this movie overall is that if you watch the movie and then the series, it will really make the entire series a waste to watch.  But with that note aside, I give Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal (DC Version) four stars out of five.My name is Amone, Adios!",4,Filling In The Holes,1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,1681,"['Samurai', 'swords', 'blood', 'oh', 'people', 'ADV', 'have', 'released', 'Samuari', 'X', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'D.C', 'Edition', 'great', 'series', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'was', 'released', 'fans', 'have', 'been', 'dieing', 'find', 'out', 'Kenshin', 'protaginist', 'mysterios', 'past.The', 'year', '1850', 'Guns', 'are', 'slowly', 'being', 'brought', 'Japan', 'rise', 'Tokugawa', 'shogunate', 'beginning', 'legend', 'Shinta', 'small', 'boy', 'who', 'parents', 'have', 'died', 'serve', 'protect', 'innocent', 'people', 'when', 'Shinta', 'guardians', 'were', 'killed', 'Seijuro', 'Hiko', 'train', 'young', 'boy', 'Giving', 'name', 'Kenshin.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Kenshin', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'movie', 'down', 'part', 'watch', 'movie', 'series', 'really', 'magic', 'series', 'want', 'get', 'movie', 'then', 'get', 'series', 'first.Graphics', 'are', 'unbelievable', 'series', 'graphics', 'are', 'much', 'improved', 'growing', 'up', 'watching', 'series', 'kind', 'missed', 'old', 'graphics', 'parts', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'combine', 'real-life', 'footage', 'animated', 'footage', 'together.Audio-wise', 'movie', 'really', 'limits', 'comapered', 'series', 'music', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'chosen', 'progress', 'story', 'was', 'sound', 'effects', 'voice', 'acting', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'weak', 'lines.The', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'DC', 'version', 'extended', 'scenes', 'are', 'already', 'put', 'movie.The', 'down', 'part', 'movie', 'overall', 'watch', 'movie', 'then', 'series', 'will', 'really', 'make', 'entire', 'series', 'waste', 'watch', 'note', 'aside', 'give', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'DC', 'Version', 'four', 'five.My', 'name', 'Amone', 'Adios']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal
741965,A10U58PHFDK81C,B00008G8PP,The Anime  Adict,"[1, 1]","Okay where to begin. First off for the two of you who don't know Samurai X are the oavs that are extensions to the manga Rurouni Kenshin. The reason it is not named that is because the animated version ofthe tale is published by a different company. Trust and Betrayal takes place during the main characters youth. Though the movie can be watched seperately it is best enjoyed after watching the first and second season of the anime series or the first 15 or so mangas volumes.First off three warnings. One if your like happy light simple anime, look else where Samurai X trust and betral are anything but happy light and simple. Second though not essentual you should have some knowledge of the samurai code of honor, it helps a great deal when it come to motives behind the characters. And lastly and perhaps most importantly this film is not for children, this is not because there is anything objectably besides gore in the film, rather the stroy if so complex and subtle children simply won't understand what's going on.Now on to the actual review. Samurai X Trust and Betral is simply put perfection incarnate and one of the few anime ever made that can stand beside legendary series like Neon Genesis Evangleion and the like and not be out of place. The story takes place during the beginnings of the Japanese revolution that began the Maji Restoration and fouces upon a assassin named Kenshin Himura. I won't go into details about the plot however as i said this story is a true tragedy. Think Romeo and Juilet except with samurai and tens times more tragic. The story is very VERY sad and this is resounded in every aspect of the film, from the color scheme to the voice acting and music. Also there are alot of things going on behind the story and are rather subtle side in presentation. However if you truly grasp the more subtle things of the story you will find it to be one of the best stories ever written peroid.On to the art. What can I say really other then that I have seen well over two hundred anime series and I yet to see anything say for a few Myhozoki films that even come close to the animation and art work. Yes it is that good even though only pastel colors are used these furhter reinforce the sense of tragdy. By traditional anime values the character are almost ugly however if not expecting that they are beautifully drawn, especially the faces and eyes.To the music, hummm there have been few sounds tracks that fit whats happening on the screen so perfectly. Though for the most part sad it is beautiful music and if you can buy the sound track.Next is the voice acting. The japanese actors are great however for one of the few times the english actors are actually better and fit the characters perfectly and hit every mark. The only problem is the mispronouncing of the main female character's name, which is somewhat frustrating but easily forgiven.The characters are well thought out and unlike any others in all animedom. By the end of the film I could honestly say that I felt like I knew each of them on a personal level which is rare.Lastly Samurai X trust and betrayal is one of the best stories ever put to paper or to the screen. I recommend everyone watch this film once they come of age. Especially during the teens years when kids are starting to ask why war and murder are bad things. This film gives a clear and definite answer, if somewhat complex. Now then enough talk go buy now, you'll at the very least like this one if not completely love it.",5,Words of Advice,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,3498,"['Okay', 'where', 'begin', 'First', 'two', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Samurai', 'X', 'are', 'oavs', 'are', 'extensions', 'manga', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'reason', 'not', 'named', 'animated', 'version', 'tale', 'published', 'different', 'company', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'place', 'main', 'characters', 'youth', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'seperately', 'best', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'first', 'second', 'season', 'anime', 'series', 'first', '15', 'so', 'mangas', 'volumes.First', 'three', 'warnings', 'One', 'happy', 'light', 'simple', 'anime', 'look', 'else', 'where', 'Samurai', 'X', 'trust', 'betral', 'are', 'anything', 'happy', 'light', 'simple', 'Second', 'not', 'essentual', 'should', 'have', 'knowledge', 'samurai', 'code', 'honor', 'great', 'deal', 'when', 'come', 'motives', 'characters', 'lastly', 'perhaps', 'most', 'importantly', 'film', 'not', 'children', 'not', 'anything', 'objectably', 'gore', 'film', 'rather', 'stroy', 'so', 'complex', 'subtle', 'children', 'simply', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'on.Now', 'actual', 'review', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Trust', 'Betral', 'simply', 'put', 'perfection', 'incarnate', 'one', 'few', 'anime', 'ever', 'made', 'can', 'stand', 'beside', 'legendary', 'series', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangleion', 'like', 'not', 'be', 'place', 'story', 'place', 'beginnings', 'Japanese', 'revolution', 'began', 'Maji', 'Restoration', 'fouces', 'assassin', 'named', 'Kenshin', 'Himura', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'plot', 'however', 'i', 'said', 'story', 'true', 'tragedy', 'Think', 'Romeo', 'Juilet', 'samurai', 'tens', 'times', 'more', 'tragic', 'story', 'very', 'VERY', 'sad', 'resounded', 'aspect', 'film', 'color', 'scheme', 'voice', 'acting', 'music', 'Also', 'are', 'alot', 'things', 'going', 'story', 'are', 'rather', 'subtle', 'side', 'presentation', 'However', 'truly', 'grasp', 'more', 'subtle', 'things', 'story', 'will', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'ever', 'written', 'peroid.On', 'art', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'really', 'other', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'well', 'two', 'hundred', 'anime', 'series', 'yet', 'see', 'anything', 'say', 'few', 'Myhozoki', 'films', 'even', 'come', 'close', 'animation', 'art', 'work', 'Yes', 'good', 'even', 'only', 'pastel', 'colors', 'are', 'used', 'furhter', 'reinforce', 'sense', 'tragdy', 'traditional', 'anime', 'character', 'are', 'almost', 'ugly', 'however', 'not', 'expecting', 'are', 'beautifully', 'drawn', 'especially', 'eyes.To', 'music', 'hummm', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'sounds', 'tracks', 'fit', 'whats', 'happening', 'screen', 'so', 'perfectly', 'most', 'part', 'sad', 'beautiful', 'music', 'can', 'buy', 'sound', 'track.Next', 'voice', 'acting', 'japanese', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'however', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'english', 'actors', 'are', 'actually', 'better', 'fit', 'characters', 'perfectly', 'hit', 'mark', 'only', 'problem', 'mispronouncing', 'main', 'female', 'character', 'name', 'somewhat', 'frustrating', 'easily', 'forgiven.The', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'others', 'animedom', 'end', 'film', 'could', 'honestly', 'say', 'felt', 'knew', 'personal', 'level', 'rare.Lastly', 'Samurai', 'X', 'trust', 'betrayal', 'one', 'best', 'stories', 'ever', 'put', 'paper', 'screen', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'watch', 'film', 'once', 'come', 'age', 'Especially', 'teens', 'years', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'starting', 'ask', 'why', 'war', 'murder', 'are', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'clear', 'definite', 'answer', 'somewhat', 'complex', 'Now', 'then', 'enough', 'talk', 'go', 'buy', 'now', ""'ll"", 'very', 'least', 'one', 'not', 'completely', 'love']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal
741966,A24SA7IVTEHCMI,B00008G8PP,The Otaku,"[4, 4]","I loved this movie. The animation is superb (except in the few small scenes with intertwine real images with animation) and the story dark and chilling. Just for a note, this OVA (Original Video Animation) is properly titled Rurouni Kenshin OVA: Trust and Betrayal. Samurai X is an American title to catch buyers (just a note in case that turned you off).Storywise, this is basically the story of a revolution against the tyrannical military-government in Japan, the Tokugawa Shogunate, a dictator who over-ruled the Emperor himself. Our anti-hero Kenshin's life is followed from his days as Shinta, and the meeting of his master, Hiko, to the end of his Hirokiri Battousai days. We have Kenshin as a little child, innocent with his top and memories of family, then Kenshin the brutal assassin for the Choshu (I believe that's who he worked for, haven't seen it in a few weeks) Clan, and finally we see Kenshin as the lover of Tomoe, a mysterious woman Kenshin meets after an ambush.I don't wish to reveal the story any further. To sum up a recommendation, a dark and emotional story, superb animation (save the live action/animation shots which are minimal), a romance between two emotionally scarred people, fantasticly choreographied sword fights, and a two-for-one bundle. If this sounds like you, I bet you'd like Rurouni Kenshin OVA: Trust and Betrayal ""Director's Cut"" (Samurai X).",5,Dark Story and Animation...Perfect,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,1388,"['loved', 'movie', 'animation', 'superb', 'few', 'small', 'scenes', 'intertwine', 'real', 'images', 'animation', 'story', 'dark', 'chilling', 'Just', 'note', 'OVA', 'Original', 'Video', 'Animation', 'properly', 'titled', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'OVA', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'Samurai', 'X', 'American', 'title', 'catch', 'buyers', 'just', 'note', 'case', 'turned', 'off', '.Storywise', 'basically', 'story', 'revolution', 'tyrannical', 'military-government', 'Japan', 'Tokugawa', 'Shogunate', 'dictator', 'who', 'over-ruled', 'Emperor', 'anti-hero', 'Kenshin', 'life', 'followed', 'days', 'Shinta', 'meeting', 'master', 'Hiko', 'end', 'Hirokiri', 'Battousai', 'days', 'have', 'Kenshin', 'little', 'child', 'innocent', 'top', 'memories', 'family', 'then', 'Kenshin', 'brutal', 'assassin', 'Choshu', 'believe', 'who', 'worked', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'few', 'weeks', 'Clan', 'finally', 'see', 'Kenshin', 'lover', 'Tomoe', 'mysterious', 'woman', 'Kenshin', 'meets', 'ambush.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'wish', 'reveal', 'story', 'further', 'sum', 'up', 'recommendation', 'dark', 'emotional', 'story', 'superb', 'animation', 'save', 'live', 'action/animation', 'shots', 'are', 'minimal', 'romance', 'two', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'people', 'fantasticly', 'choreographied', 'sword', 'fights', 'two-for-one', 'bundle', 'bet', ""'d"", 'like', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'OVA', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'Director', 'Cut', 'Samurai', 'X']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal

I had never heard of it so he lent his copy to me to watch over the weekend. What struck me as most obvious was how closely the plot follows Joseph Campbell's description of the necessary steps on the hero's quest. A quick search on Google shows these two topics do a dance with one another on lots of pages. So this point is nothing new. It may very well account for the power the movie has - the plot follows the ideal map of the hero's quest very closely. It is fascinating how following Campbell's map seems to insure such dramatic interest.,5,Campbell's Hero Quest,1238284800,"03 29, 2009",2009,612,"['asking', 'friend', 'what', 'favorite', 'movie', 'was', 'said', 'one', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'lent', 'copy', 'watch', 'weekend', 'What', 'struck', 'most', 'obvious', 'was', 'how', 'closely', 'plot', 'Joseph', 'Campbell', 'description', 'necessary', 'steps', 'hero', 'quest', 'quick', 'search', 'Google', 'two', 'topics', 'do', 'dance', 'one', 'lots', 'pages', 'So', 'point', 'nothing', 'new', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'account', 'power', 'movie', 'plot', 'ideal', 'map', 'hero', 'quest', 'very', 'closely', 'fascinating', 'how', 'following', 'Campbell', 'map', 'insure', 'such', 'dramatic', 'interest']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal
741969,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B00008G8PP,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 0]","Noburo Watsunuki probably had no idea just how popular ""Rorouni Kenshin"" would be. What started out as a manga became a long running TV series and has spawned a major animated movie. ""SAMURAI X Trust and Betrayal Director's cut"" (aka. Ruroni Kenshin: Meiji Kenkaku roman tan: Tsuioku hen) is the precursor to the TV series, and tells the origins of the assassin called Kenshin Himura. Both ""Trust and Betrayal"" have been edited together, combining the 4 OVA episodes into one coherent movie. If you've seen ""Reflections"" then you will need to see this installment to fully understand the roots of its story. The film is based on the ""Romantic Tales of the Meiji Era"" and scenes were added to give the script a lot more continuity and more detail.A samurai in his purest form were built upon a technique that is as much a science as an art form. A samurai would live and die under his code of Bushido--they embraced art, culture and were philosophers in their own right. I loved the classic samurai tales of Kurosawa, Kobayashi and Okamoto. Director/writer Kazuhiro Furuhashi along with screenplay by Masashi Sogo has captured the spirit of the chambara classics and essence of the romantic classics in anime form. Telling fictionalized origins but partly based on true accounts, this is the story of Hitokiri Battousai--the man who kills men like a demon.During an attack by bandits, a young boy named Shinta was rescued by a highly skilled swordsman named Seijuro Hiko. Touched by the boy's passion and sense of justice, he trains the young boy in the teachings of the Mitsurugi style of swordplay and renames him Kenshin Himura. Kenshin (voiced by Mayo Suzukaze) is an idealist, very pure in his beliefs in creating a better world. Kenshin is recruited by the leader of the Choshu clan to perform acts of political assassination, and he becomes the most feared assassin in Kyoto. However, Kenshin's soul is becoming as war torn as the battlefields of Japan--his bloody work slowly stripping away his humanity. Kenshin still hopes for peace and finds his hopes personified in a beautiful woman named Tomoe (voiced by Junko Iwao) who shows him a life beyond the sword. Sadly, Tomoe is also torn by ghosts from her past. Can Kenshin and Tomoe save each other and find happiness?The film's backdrop is set during a civil unrest in 1864. Different factions are in a struggle for power and the ruling Shogunate is known for enforcing abrasive laws. The Shinsengumi are the enforcers of the governing body and they are tasked in quelling rebellions before they come to fruition. All clans have their own brand of justice and they all believe they have a noble cause. Such is the Choshu clan to which Kenshin is affiliated with, they believe their cause is honorable and Kenshin lends his sword to their brand of justice.While the show does have its levels of political intrigue, and has the usual elements of honor, duty and loyalty; the film focuses on Kenshin. His emotions, doubts and hopes take center stage, as well as his relationship with Tomoe. I really liked the detailed execution of the screenplay and the structure of its storytelling. It just so full of emotions and I was very impressed. Director Furuhashi knew exactly what he was going for, and while the story itself isn't wholly original, I couldn't help but be very involved with its storyline. Hatred and revenge, disappointments, love and redemption--betrayal, loss and tragedy are the film's main strengths. The film has a very serious tone and the animated cinematography is both beautiful and sad, with some use of metaphors and symbolism, fitting to the film's main premise. The film just manages to flesh out and define each and every emotion (or shifts in emotions) to give a fine narrative impact.The film also has an abundance of swordplay. The fights are exquisitely animated and very bloody--the usual Japanese trademark of splattering blood is used to emulate its violence and brutality. Heads are stabbed, bodies are cut in half, necks are slashed, blood is sprayed. The film is perfectly animated and the camera shots are quite similar to jidai geki films such as ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and ""Azumi"". The action is nicely placed and each encounter carries a lot of expressive impact and at the same time, cold and visceral. The scenes of violence and brutality is an inherent part of the plot and not unwarranted as with some other anime who uses this effect as a gimmick. It is not your kid's anime.Those who are used to the animation in the ""Rurouni Kenshin"" TV series may be taken aback. Its style is quite different and has no over-expressive bulging eyes. The colors are occasionally muted to convey its mood, although some shots are colorful but nonetheless retains a dark and gloomy atmosphere. The eyes and facial expressions show a lot of humanity--when a character is in emotional pain, the camera will linger a bit to make the viewer feel the running emotions. The rendering is simple and while not exactly as accurate (clothes and hair styles) historically, it maintains an anime style, but it didn't hamper the film even one bit. The music is also quite enthralling and goes nicely with each scene to reflect the mood.""Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal"" is a very good film. It is not perfect but it is just so entertaining and touching in its execution. It succeeds in delivering much needed emotions and has given anime fans a good reason to celebrate. It can satisfy action fanatics and delivers an intelligent, cleverly structured samurai drama. Its subtle touches in wordplay, metaphors and melodrama are well-balanced that proved to be a very good re-watch. The film has definite replay value and is a fantastic companion film to the TV series. This animated film will make you love the TV show even more and will make you a fan if you`re not.Deeply tragic and quite beautiful in structure, this anime movie is Highly Recommended!

Excellent story, top-notch animation, pathos and melodrama, over-the-top sword fighting...everything you want from sword-fight flicks.  There is a big difference between good chambara and bad chambara, and there is far more bad chambara than good.  This DVD is an overwhelmingly pleasant surprise.Medieval Japan is on good display here, with an nice blend between fact and fantasy.  Not exactly Kurosawa, and not exactly &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; the warriors perform some pretty amazing feats befitting the super samurai that they are. The blood is fairly fountain-like, but not silly.This is my only experience with &quot;Rurouni Kenshin,&quot; and to tell the truth, a friend had to force this DVD on me as I didn't want to see anything with the stupid name of &quot;Samurai X.&quot;  I am glad that I gave it a chance.",5,Top notch sword fight flick,1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,955,"['quot', 'Samurai', 'X', 'Trust', 'Betrayal', 'Director', 'Cut', 'quot', 'probably', 'best', 'chambara', 'anime', 'have', 'seen', 'Excellent', 'story', 'top-notch', 'animation', 'pathos', 'melodrama', 'over-the-top', 'sword', 'fighting', 'everything', 'want', 'sword-fight', 'flicks', 'big', 'difference', 'good', 'chambara', 'bad', 'chambara', 'far', 'more', 'bad', 'chambara', 'good', 'DVD', 'overwhelmingly', 'pleasant', 'surprise.Medieval', 'Japan', 'good', 'display', 'here', 'nice', 'blend', 'fact', 'fantasy', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Kurosawa', 'not', 'exactly', 'quot', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'quot', 'warriors', 'perform', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'feats', 'befitting', 'super', 'samurai', 'are', 'blood', 'fairly', 'fountain-like', 'not', 'silly.This', 'only', 'experience', 'quot', 'Rurouni', 'Kenshin', 'quot', 'tell', 'truth', 'friend', 'had', 'force', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'anything', 'stupid', 'name', 'quot', 'Samurai', 'X.', 'quot', 'am', 'glad', 'gave', 'chance']",Samurai X - Trust & Betrayal

The dialogue was mature and philosophical. I won't tell you any part of the story because it has been elaborated on from the other reviewers. I purchased this Director's Cut version not too long ago and overall I am very pleased due to the entire story continuing seamlessly but there were some minor dialogue changes that I thought was inaccurate from the originals.
