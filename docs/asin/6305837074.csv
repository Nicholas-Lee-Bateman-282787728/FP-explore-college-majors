I had to purchase a used copy but found a reputable vendor thru Amazon who guaranteed their merchandise.  It was worth the wait.  The audio in DTS mode is very good and the video is very acceptable.  There is no big stage production, just musicians playing some great stuff.  I saw Frampton during his heyday on the Comes Alive tour.  White amps and a huge white canvas on the stage was pretty cool back then in front of over 20K fans but this performance in Detroit just rocks.Note that the audio set up is in the Bonus Features.",5,Alive & Becoming Collectable,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",2011,667,"['attempted', 'purchase', 'DVD', '6', 'months', 'ago', 'Evidently', 'become', 'collectable', 'item', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'find', 'had', 'purchase', 'used', 'copy', 'found', 'reputable', 'vendor', 'thru', 'Amazon', 'who', 'guaranteed', 'merchandise', 'was', 'worth', 'wait', 'audio', 'DTS', 'mode', 'very', 'good', 'video', 'very', 'acceptable', 'big', 'stage', 'production', 'just', 'musicians', 'playing', 'great', 'stuff', 'saw', 'Frampton', 'heyday', 'Comes', 'Alive', 'tour', 'White', 'amps', 'huge', 'white', 'canvas', 'stage', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'back', 'then', 'front', '20K', 'fans', 'performance', 'Detroit', 'just', 'rocks.Note', 'audio', 'set', 'up', 'Bonus', 'Features']",Peter Frampton - Live in Detroit

I have been a Frampton fan  since  I heard Comes Alive back in 76. This dvd is GREAT. The picture  quality is superb, the sound is supurb, and  just the way the whole thing  was put together is totally awesome. Frampton is playing in Detroit at the  Pine Knob Ampitheater, in front of a packed house. The crowd enthuasium is  very high, and Frampton gets it up even higher. He plays all his old hits  like, Baby I love Your Way, Show Me The Way, Do You Feel Like We Do, and  some other old stuff, as well as some newer stuff. I must say, that he has  not lost it. He still has that distinguishable guitar sound and voice that  we as Peter Frampton fans love. If you close your eyes while you have this  dvd playing, you could almost swear that it was 1976 all over again.  People, this dvd is really that good.

480523,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,6305837074,moviemusicbuff,"[12, 12]","I agree with most of the other reviewers and I enjoyed this performance by Peter Frampton.  I am a casual fan of Frampton and really enjoyed the CD ""Frampton Comes Alive"" which is the quintessential classic rock live album of the 70's. I've been wanting to see a live performance of these songs by Frampton for some time and I was glad that this DVD was available.  My favorite tracks on this DVD are the well-known hits, ""Show Me the Way,"" ""Baby I Love Your Way"", ""Something's Happening,"" and ""Do You Feel Like We Do?""  An older looking Frampton plays these pieces with great enthusiasm and great skill, and he is backed by a great band.  On ""Do You Feel Like We Do?""  Frampton gets interrupted by a fan who walks across the stage, and he is visibly distraced by that -- the keyboardist then plays his solo piece, Frampton introduces the band, and then plays his voice-box / guitar, building up to a good climax at the end.  On this song ""Do You Feel Like We Do?"" Frampton's solo work differs from the ""Frampton Comes Alive"" version -- it is rather abbreviated, and not as fluid as his 1976 performance.  Also, his voice-box work features different lines, such as ""Do You Feel Horny?"" and ""Thank You!""  If you're a purist like me and are looking for a performance similar to that on ""Frampton Comes Alive"" CD it is a bit different on ""Do You Feel Like We Do?"".The other songs that I thought were great were the 2 pieces in the encore.  Overall, I enjoyed the 70's songs more than the recent songs.I really wish that someday, they would release the DVD of the classic performance by Frampton in 1976. It's too bad that this is the only DVD available right now of Frampton's live work.One of the best segments in the Special Features is the video interview of Frampton.  Frampton talks about his beginnings and his experiences with bands such as Humbie Pie, his quick rise to fame after Frampton Comes Alive, and his relationship with Steve Marriott, and then how this performance in Detroit came together.  I really enjoyed this interview. It is a rare glimpse into the heart and thoughts of an outstanding musician. Frampton is a very down-to-earth and honest guy.If you enjoyed Frampton's guitar playing, you will not want to miss his playing on The Best of Ringo Starr DVD which is also available.  Frampton absolutely rocks in his guitar playing and singing of ""Sunshine of Your Love,"" (w/ Jack Bruce) and ""Norwegian Wood"" (solo).  You'll definitely want to check out this DVD.I give this DVD 4 1/2 stars.

One middle aged fan is so intense he runs onstage to give PF a hug while the great one is engaged in a slow burn guitar solo.

The sound is outstanding in 5.1 and the video is well edited to give you the feel of being at the show. I guess I forgot what an awesome lead guitar player Frampton is.
