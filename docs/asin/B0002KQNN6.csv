This is the only movie in which she is the star, and she makes the most of it.  The film shows her growing from a fragile, angry, emotionally devastated wife-mother into a strong, loving and sympathetic woman, what her Jewish husband might call a ""mensch.""  Her love scene with the unlikely Lothaire Bluteau (as a Christ-like healer, the only living virgin in the former USSR) is the emotional climax, literally, of the movie.  The ending is just right, especially if you've been paying attention to the signs along the way.

838809,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,B0002KQNN6,Dai-keag-ity,"[0, 0]","The Healer sounds great on the box but trust me, it's a powerful letdown. There are also apparently several versions of it out there under more than one title (Julie Walking Home being another name for the same film). The version I saw was widescreen instead of letterbox and was inexplicably shorn of the nudity and cussing I later found was scattered throughout the uncut movie, which was kind of a rip, I think.This film, The Healer, begins with all the lackluster banality of a movie-of-the-week style human interest story regarding adultery and its aftermath, evolves into a pathos-seeking tale of the toll a terminally sick child takes on his Canadian family, then slides sideways to find what seems its main focus as a story about a supernatural healer making his rounds among the infirm of distant Poland. After this is accomplished and just as the plot seems to flirt with meaning, The Healer then falls apart with total finality as it becomes mired in its final act, namely scenes from a love affair between the European-born healer and the mother of the  dangerously ill little boy he has either healer or not healed.The Healer had some watchable actors, especially the radiantly beautiful Miranda Otto, and good locations, but it lacked a true plot and would often go off in puzzlingly irrelevant directions that were annoyingly frustrating. Characters were introduced and then dropped, storylines dangled and went nowhere, and some developments amounted to what mystery writers used to call ""red herrings."" And the ending...oh my gosh, what ending? This movie doesn't come with a conclusion, just a sudden cessation that stuns with its alacrity and absence of closure. Ultimately The Healer answers no questions, resolves absolutely nothing about its characters or their situations, their futures or the outcome to anything that was introduced earlier in its 114-minute run-time. It departs with an abruptness that amounts to amateurish rudeness.So what is this chaotic movie about?

838813,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0002KQNN6,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[17, 21]","""The Healer"" is the Australian television name for an independent film (a joint Canadian-Polish production) that was originally entitled ""Julie Walking Home.""  Knowing both titles for this 2002 film, and the interesting combination of nations the production represents, is key because it really is two different movies thrown together with some degree of success.  I checked it out because I wanted to see Miranda Otto in it (big  &Eacute;owyn fan) and knew absolutely nothing about it (my assumption was that she would be the title character since her face is the only one on the cover, but that proves not to be the case).After the prologue in which we since the healer first being a healer, ""Julie Walking Home"" would describe the first act of this film from director Agnieszka Holland (""Washington Square"").  Julie Makowsky (Miranda Otto) comes home early from a trip with her eight-year-old twins, Nick (Ryan Smith) and Nicole (Bianca Crudo), and gets an unpleasant surprise from her husband, Henry (Willaim Fichtner).  Her response is to take the kids and leave immediately, but they are in the back of the car screaming about daddy running after them and one of the twins gets out.  As far as Julie is concerned her marriage is over and I was intrigued by the notion of a pair of twins, who are closer than most twins, torn apart by a divorce.  But that is not with this film is about because before the family can break apart one of the twins gets sick.The doctors say there is no hope and from a most unexpected source Julie hears about Alexei the healer (Lothair Bluteau), a Russian who is laying hands on the sick and dying in Poland.  So she packs up her dying child over her husband's objections and heads to Europe.  Once there, Alexei picks her out of the crowd and puts his hands on her child.  ""The Healer"" second act of this film is potentially interesting: you find yourself wondering what happened to Alexei over the years between the boy we saw in the prologue and the man he is now.  But the focus of the movie suddenly shifts to the attraction between Alexei and Julie and suddenly this film is a romance.Now we have a third movie, which, again, is potentially interesting.  Julie has already proven she will do anything to save her child, so what must she think about Alexei's attention?  Throw into this the fact that Julie is on the rebound from her marriage and has been critical of religion, and the complex emotions with which she is dealing seem rather overwhelming.  Indeed, Otto's performance is the centerpiece of this film, but the script, by Holland along with Roman Gren and Arlene Sarner puts her through too much in the last act.  When Julie makes love to Alexei it is hard to tell if she is really in love or just extremely grateful.  Those who check out ""The Healer"" because of Otto will not be disappointed by her performance, but they will feel unsatisfied by how all the plot threads are resolved in by the finish.  There are the bits and pieces of a couple of good films here, but the mix does not match.",3,Miranda Otto shines in this one until the script bogs down,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,3048,"['Healer', 'Australian', 'television', 'name', 'independent', 'film', 'joint', 'Canadian-Polish', 'production', 'was', 'originally', 'entitled', 'Julie', 'Walking', 'Home', 'Knowing', 'titles', '2002', 'film', 'interesting', 'combination', 'nations', 'production', 'key', 'really', 'two', 'different', 'movies', 'thrown', 'together', 'degree', 'success', 'checked', 'out', 'wanted', 'see', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'big', 'Eacute', 'fan', 'knew', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'assumption', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'title', 'character', 'face', 'only', 'one', 'cover', 'not', 'be', 'case', '.After', 'prologue', 'healer', 'first', 'being', 'healer', 'Julie', 'Walking', 'Home', 'would', 'describe', 'first', 'act', 'film', 'director', 'Agnieszka', 'Holland', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Julie', 'Makowsky', 'Miranda', 'Otto', 'home', 'early', 'trip', 'eight-year-old', 'twins', 'Nick', 'Ryan', 'Smith', 'Nicole', 'Bianca', 'Crudo', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'husband', 'Henry', 'Willaim', 'Fichtner', 'response', 'take', 'kids', 'leave', 'immediately', 'are', 'back', 'car', 'screaming', 'daddy', 'running', 'one', 'twins', 'out', 'As', 'far', 'Julie', 'concerned', 'marriage', 'was', 'intrigued', 'notion', 'pair', 'twins', 'who', 'are', 'closer', 'most', 'twins', 'torn', 'apart', 'divorce', 'not', 'film', 'about', 'family', 'can', 'break', 'apart', 'one', 'twins', 'sick.The', 'doctors', 'say', 'hope', 'most', 'unexpected', 'source', 'Julie', 'Alexei', 'healer', 'Lothair', 'Bluteau', 'Russian', 'who', 'laying', 'hands', 'sick', 'dying', 'Poland', 'up', 'dying', 'child', 'husband', 'objections', 'heads', 'Europe', 'Once', 'there', 'Alexei', 'out', 'crowd', 'hands', 'child', 'Healer', 'second', 'act', 'film', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'find', 'wondering', 'what', 'happened', 'Alexei', 'years', 'boy', 'saw', 'prologue', 'man', 'now', 'focus', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'attraction', 'Alexei', 'Julie', 'suddenly', 'film', 'romance.Now', 'have', 'third', 'movie', 'again', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'Julie', 'already', 'proven', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'save', 'child', 'what', 'must', 'think', 'Alexei', 'attention', 'Throw', 'fact', 'Julie', 'rebound', 'marriage', 'been', 'critical', 'religion', 'complex', 'emotions', 'dealing', 'seem', 'rather', 'overwhelming', 'Indeed', 'Otto', 'performance', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'script', 'Holland', 'Roman', 'Gren', 'Arlene', 'Sarner', 'too', 'much', 'last', 'act', 'When', 'Julie', 'love', 'Alexei', 'hard', 'tell', 'really', 'love', 'just', 'extremely', 'grateful', 'who', 'check', 'Healer', 'Otto', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'performance', 'will', 'feel', 'unsatisfied', 'how', 'plot', 'threads', 'are', 'resolved', 'finish', 'are', 'bits', 'pieces', 'couple', 'good', 'films', 'here', 'mix', 'not', 'match']",The Healer

I'm a huge fan of the LOTR Trilogy, so I figured I'd give it a shot since Miranda Otto (who plays Eowyn in LOTR) was in it. What a waste of time! The person who said they want those ""113 minutes of their life back"" is dead right.Sure, it may be realistic in the beginning, but this is a prime example of one of the things that drives me crazy about indy movies. They get too pretentious when they try to be so character driven, and spend too much time giving us information we really don't need to know.It could have been much more magical, but it gives us a boring ending--not to mention it drags on for ages before anything happens.
