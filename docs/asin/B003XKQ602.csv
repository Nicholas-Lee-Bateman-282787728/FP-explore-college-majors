Both audio and visual gels really well. I can't wait to receive my blu ray disc but for now, I shall pop in the DVD and enjoy it.Note : For an unforgetable experience, you must have at least a reasonable sound system setup to really appreciate this disc as without it then it is just another ordinary boring disc.",5,"Calmness, Relax and Soothing to the ears !!!",1342051200,"07 12, 2012",2012,647,"['have', 'never', 'dwell', 'kind', 'stuff/genre', 'trying', 'out', 'Echoes', 'Creation', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'must', 'have', 'blu', 'ray', 'give', 'further', 'justice', 'hi-def', 'experience', 'visual', 'simply', 'breathtaking', 'relaxing', 'eyes', 'music', 'simply', 'sootihing', 'ear', 'audio', 'visual', 'gels', 'really', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'receive', 'blu', 'ray', 'disc', 'now', 'shall', 'pop', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'it.Note', 'unforgetable', 'experience', 'must', 'have', 'least', 'reasonable', 'sound', 'system', 'setup', 'really', 'appreciate', 'disc', 'then', 'just', 'ordinary', 'boring', 'disc']",Echoes of Creation As Seen on Public Television

I also love the fact that 90% of it was filmed in Washington state!

1370627,AQMI1W1RIRW90,B003XKQ602,D. Williams,"[0, 1]",How many Blu-ray DVDs have you bought of nature that were not really HD but were just the old blurry resolution repackaged in a Blu-ray disk shell and called HD -- which should be punishable by a crime in my opinion because they are not. The views are good but the sharpness and quality of the visual picture are NOT HD in my view and it should somehow be a crime for people to market a product as HD or Blu-ray when it is not!

1370628,A3SO0GDQZ8Q8NB,B003XKQ602,"Garry McGonigle ""GMc""","[1, 2]",This disk is a blu-ray version of a short film that briefly touches on some of the majesty of nature. Great photography and soundtrack by David Arkenstone are part of this production but it is more of a short film than something of greater depth. While a great appetizer it is not the main course I expected. Nickman is accomplished but simply doesn't produce this at the level one would hope.,4,Short of Most of Creation,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,393,"['disk', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'short', 'film', 'briefly', 'touches', 'majesty', 'nature', 'Great', 'photography', 'soundtrack', 'David', 'Arkenstone', 'are', 'part', 'production', 'more', 'short', 'film', 'something', 'greater', 'depth', 'great', 'appetizer', 'not', 'main', 'course', 'expected', 'Nickman', 'accomplished', 'simply', ""n't"", 'produce', 'level', 'one', 'would', 'hope']",Echoes of Creation As Seen on Public Television
