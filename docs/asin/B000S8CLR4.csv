Perhaps if NBC had not scheduled it to compete with a CBS blockbuster and it hadn't replaced a loser series that had conditioned audiences to stick with the other networks, it would have succeeded on non-cable TV.But another factor is the bleak stupidity of the brothers' decisions that serve as plot sparks.  The actors are pretty and talented, but the noir hopelessness of their choices can be offputting.  Therefore, I might have not continued to watch to the end of a network episode, but am altogether comfortable with this product as the DVD of what's basically the grist of a successful cable series.P.S.:  It's especially nice to see Kate Milgrew play such a different character from Janeway, and to capture the character so well.

Unfortunately, I watched the entire 13 episode run at once and it just runs out of steam by the third episode and never gets it back.Part of the problem is that we've seen this all before. The novelty of a narrator who keeps changing his story is original. The rest of it is just gangster cliche. The ambiguous morality of the gangster genre usually plays out well, but this is network television and they didn't want a main character who was doing truly despicable things. Instead he's a nice guy who sometimes has to kill people who completely deserve it. Sure, one of the brothers is a heroin addict, but the addiction comes and goes when the plot requires it.Other problems include the fact that it was written to be an ongoing series that looked like a series with a definite end point. When the narrator is being interrogated by cops about ""the bodies"" you know that eventually the writers are going to have to cough up the bodies. Now a show like The Wire: The Complete Series has the luxury of telling a story with a beginning, middle and end. However, in television most of the storylines have to go likeHasbro Spider-Man & Friends Sing-a-Long Spider-Manwhere everything comes back to a shaky status quo. Sure, some network shows likeLost: The Complete Fourth SeasonorHow I Met Your Mother: Season Fourcan pull it off, but only barely.Those shows work because they have engaging characters and a storyline that keeps moving along. The Black Donnellys is stuck in a series of nothing happening. Tommy gets in trouble. Tommy stays in trouble. Tommy gets out of trouble. Jimmy gets in trouble. Tommy and Jenny get involved. They get uninvolved. They make eyes at each other. They are meant to be together but they can never get together.Blah. Blah blah.I'm happy I didn't buy this thing, but truthfully, I regret borrowing it from my library.

1085660,A2D57SN63O1OH2,B000S8CLR4,"TVSeriesFinale.com ""What happened to your fav...","[102, 105]","""The Black Donnellys"" follows the story of four young Donnelly brothers -- Catholic Irish-American siblings in New York's infamous Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. The story is told by an unreliable narrator and Donnelly childhood friend named Joey 'Ice Cream' while being incarcerated. The series stars Jonathan Tucker, Thomas Guiry, Olivia Wilde, Billy Lush, Michael Stahl-David, Kirk Acevedo and Keith Nobbs. It was co-created by Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco (best known for the movie ""Crash"").The series debuted on NBC on February 26, 2007 and took the place of the troubled ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"" on Monday nights. The series' initial half hour did well (10 million) but viewership fell off significantly in the second half hour (6 million). It never got any better.NBC aired seven episodes but, with most of the rest of the network's schedule performing poorly, they had to drop it. They streamed the rest of the series online.It's a real shame because ""Donnellys"" had some solid performances and interesting characters. If NBC had been doing better, they probably would have stuck with it and perhaps even renewed it for a second year.",5,"Excellent series, cancelled too soon!",1182556800,"06 23, 2007",2007,1148,"['Black', 'Donnellys', 'story', 'four', 'young', 'Donnelly', 'brothers', 'Catholic', 'Irish-American', 'siblings', 'New', 'York', 'infamous', 'Hell', 'Kitchen', 'neighborhood', 'story', 'told', 'unreliable', 'narrator', 'Donnelly', 'childhood', 'friend', 'named', 'Joey', 'Cream', 'being', 'incarcerated', 'series', 'Jonathan', 'Tucker', 'Thomas', 'Guiry', 'Olivia', 'Wilde', 'Billy', 'Lush', 'Michael', 'Stahl-David', 'Kirk', 'Acevedo', 'Keith', 'Nobbs', 'was', 'co-created', 'Paul', 'Haggis', 'Bobby', 'Moresco', 'best', 'known', 'movie', 'Crash', '.The', 'series', 'debuted', 'NBC', 'February', '26', '2007', 'took', 'place', 'troubled', 'Studio', '60', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'Monday', 'nights', 'series', 'initial', 'half', 'hour', 'did', 'well', '10', 'million', 'viewership', 'fell', 'off', 'significantly', 'second', 'half', 'hour', '6', 'million', 'never', 'got', 'better.NBC', 'aired', 'seven', 'episodes', 'most', 'rest', 'network', 'schedule', 'performing', 'poorly', 'had', 'drop', 'streamed', 'rest', 'series', 'online.It', 'real', 'shame', 'Donnellys', 'had', 'solid', 'performances', 'interesting', 'characters', 'NBC', 'had', 'been', 'doing', 'better', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'stuck', 'perhaps', 'even', 'renewed', 'second', 'year']",The Black Donnellys: The Complete Series

Unlike most reviewers I prefer a series as a miniseries with a storyline written beginning to end like the great ones of the seventies Rich Man Poor Man, Chiefs, The Captains and The Kings etc. To me when a series is written to continue into further seasons just to keep an audience (as so many are) it loses credibility and often the storylines become totally ridiculous. I believe Prison Break is a case in point.So with this one as with another I have (called Profit) also done with one of the actors narrative I'm glad they remained as one season gems even though in both cases I was a little disappointed with the endings.  Written thoughtfully it kept me entertained throughout and deserves a high rating.",5,another good one,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,748,"['got', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'most', 'reviewers', 'prefer', 'series', 'miniseries', 'storyline', 'written', 'beginning', 'end', 'great', 'ones', 'seventies', 'Rich', 'Man', 'Poor', 'Man', 'Chiefs', 'Captains', 'Kings', 'etc', 'when', 'series', 'written', 'continue', 'further', 'seasons', 'just', 'keep', 'audience', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'credibility', 'often', 'storylines', 'become', 'totally', 'ridiculous', 'believe', 'Prison', 'Break', 'case', 'point.So', 'one', 'have', 'called', 'Profit', 'also', 'done', 'one', 'actors', 'narrative', ""'m"", 'glad', 'remained', 'one', 'season', 'even', 'cases', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'endings', 'Written', 'thoughtfully', 'kept', 'entertained', 'high', 'rating']",The Black Donnellys: The Complete Series
