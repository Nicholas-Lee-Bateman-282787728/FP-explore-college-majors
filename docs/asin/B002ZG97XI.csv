Changes like the elimination of the conversation where the friends decide to go to Kodiak Valley, substitution of a can of energy drink for a iPhone, and a different time travel sequence make this move a chopped up mess. The editors have destroyed both the continuity and integrity of the film. This is a real shame as the original release was actually very funny but the humor has been dumbed down on this DVD.

The story is fun and while it is plain comedy there is also a lesson to be learned in it about not giving up one's dreams. The movies is also great for the nostalgic factor. I grew up during the 80's and the movie have really captured the feeling for that decade. I do however have some complaints about this film, it is extremely crude, there is a limit to how long urine, excrements, vomits and sex are funny and they do go over the top several times. Like in one scene when there is a squirrel sitting beside one of the characters and the animal is flung away by a huge torrent of vomit. It may be that I am a girl, but I think the movie got far to crude at times.The acting in this movie is good, and while it have some problems I think the good outweighs the bad. However this is the kind of movie where one turn one's brain of and just go with the flow for if one try to put any kind of intelligence behind the absurdities then it just falls apart. I would give this movie 3 and a half star if I could but since I can't give half stars I end up on 3 stars.",3,If you can satand the crudeness then this film is really funny.,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",2010,1640,"['Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'three', 'old', 'friends', 'have', 'drifted', 'apart', 'when', 'one', 'trio', 'tried', 'kill', 'others', 'mountain', 'hotel', 'used', 'have', 'much', 'fun', 'when', 'where', 'young', 'however', 'night', 'drinking', 'hot', 'tub', 'trio', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'nephew', 'one', 'gang', 'suddenly', 'find', '1986', 'rest', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'reliving', 'youth', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'own', 'time.I', 'had', 'blast', 'watching', 'movie', 'hubby', 'laughed', 'so', 'guts', 'hurt', 'several', 'times', 'story', 'fun', 'plain', 'comedy', 'also', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'not', 'giving', 'up', 'one', 'dreams', 'movies', 'also', 'great', 'nostalgic', 'factor', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'movie', 'have', 'really', 'captured', 'feeling', 'decade', 'do', 'however', 'have', 'complaints', 'film', 'extremely', 'crude', 'limit', 'how', 'long', 'urine', 'excrements', 'vomits', 'sex', 'are', 'funny', 'do', 'go', 'top', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'scene', 'when', 'squirrel', 'sitting', 'one', 'characters', 'animal', 'flung', 'away', 'huge', 'torrent', 'vomit', 'may', 'be', 'am', 'girl', 'think', 'movie', 'got', 'far', 'crude', 'times.The', 'acting', 'movie', 'good', 'have', 'problems', 'think', 'good', 'bad', 'However', 'kind', 'movie', 'where', 'one', 'turn', 'one', 'brain', 'just', 'go', 'flow', 'one', 'try', 'put', 'kind', 'intelligence', 'absurdities', 'then', 'just', 'apart', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '3', 'half', 'star', 'could', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'half', 'stars', 'end', 'up', '3', 'stars']",Hot Tub Time Machine

His nephew, Jacob (Clark Duke), is a stay-in-the-basement nerd. Nick (Craig Robinson) works at a pet spa and Lou (Rob Corddry) is suicidal.And it's Lou that gets them into trouble because when a suicide attempt lands him in the hospital, the four friends decide to return to a small town, the glory place of their youth, and try and cheer him up.Greeted by a bellhop named Phil (Crispin Glover), who lost his arm long ago, the four friends try and party like they used to in a town that is no longer the cool place they remember.After one drunken night in the hot tub, they suddenly find themselves back in 1986, and what's even weirder is they also look like their younger selves. (Though onscreen we see their present-day selves but in mirrors it's their younger versions and that's what everybody else sees. Nice touch on a time travel story.) Once coming to grips of their predicament and while trying to figure out a way ""back to the future,"" they vow to maintain the space-time continuum and repeat what they did back in 1986 so as to not accidentally execute the butterfly effect and destroy the timeline. They swear to do things as they did it and how they did it back in 1986. Except little do they realize it's much easier said than done because no one wants to go through that horrific break up all over again (great white buffalo), or get their face bashed in, or sleep with a hot blonde though you're married to someone else in the future. (Actually, this last scene was done quite well.)Guided by the aloof and cryptic hot tub repairman (Chevy Chase), these four misfits either accept the misfortunes of their past or, if they're daring enough, try and right what went wrong in the past in the hopes for a better future.Being a time travel nut, I had to see this movie. I went opening night. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it.This flick was an ode to time travel movies, especially Back to the Future (and having Crispin Glover in it, who played George McFly in BttF only added to it). The 80s fashions, gadgets, phrases, music all amounted to a true trip through time and really convinced you that you were along for this crazy ride via hot tub time travel.This movie is so tongue-in-cheek yet at the same time wasn't just stupid slapstick comedy, but instead opted to take itself seriously enough to sell you on the concept.Now, I'm not sure if you're like me or not, but I really appreciate buddy-buddy humor--you know, the teasing, the kicks between the legs, the sarcasm--and the time-traveling quartet were just loaded with it, so much so you wished you were a part of their little group. And, really, the way the tale was presented in this flick, yeah, you were.So many jokes, so much sarcasm, so much fun. This movie was just amazing and I'm counting the days till I can grab the Blu-ray for my collection and watch it over and over.My only gripe was the coarse language. A handful of times in a movie--though, for me, a bit jarring--I can live with, but when it's every second word then it becomes too much and it pulls you out of the flick during those little blurts of profanity.Now I just need a hot tub time machine of my own to go back in time and check this flick out in the theatre again without having to spend the $10.25 (Canadian) all over for it.Recommended.A.P.

This movie starts off funny and energetic, and doesn't waste time getting to the titular hot tub.  I'm a fan of when people say the name of the movie in a movie, and the part where someone says the name of the movie was very funny.  ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" keeps moving, pokes fun at 80s teen comedies, and doesn't let up on the comedy.  In a way, I'm surprised I liked this movie so much.  Yes, it is crude and vulgar, but in a way that works comedically.  And, yes, the characters at the beginning are unlikeable across the board, which is usually a recipe for unfunny disaster.  However, the actors are all professional and experienced enough, and the script is written well enough, to give us reasons to not hate the characters.  Indeed, you find yourself rooting for them, and more and more so as the movie goes on.  More to the credit of the script, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is devoid of maudlin drama bits where the characters get sappy at the end; they do undergo change, but it's organic and fits in the movie as a whole.  It's great to see Cusack in a role once again where he can be really funny and show off his comedic talents.""Hot Tub Time Machine"" also doesn't overstay its welcome, at an hour forty, which is about as long as a comedy should ever be.

I didn't see whyThe Hangoverwas so great, but I had a great time watching Hot Tub Time Machine. Yes, the premise of going back in time via a hot tub is utterly ridiculous and you could see the film's ending coming from miles away, but it got a few good laughs out of even a cynic like me. Hot Tub has just the right chemistry to make it work. Maybe it's because of the excellent casting choice. In the hands of another set of actors and comedians, this movie could've really stunk.If you're a fan of Craig Robinson's style of humor or Rob Corddry's (from The Jon Stewart Show), you'll like Hot Tub. It follows a time-tested formula, used byBeerfest, the Harold and Kumar films, and many others: beer, girls, comic mishaps. Not coincidentally, it reminded me of classic 80's mischief likeRevenge of the Nerds, Back to the Future, and Weird Science for its campy humor.HTTB is at its core a buddy movie. Three dysfunctional middle-aged losers, each with their own problems and failures in life, decide to rekindle their friendship when one of them, Lou, a depressed alcoholic, tries to kill himself through carbon monoxide poisoning. They've drifted apart over the years and head off to Kodiak Valley ski resort to relive old times. They take Adam's (John Cusack) nerdy, shut-in, Second Life-addicted nephew with them. He brings along an ""illegal"" Russian energy drink on the trip. When they arrive, they find the town run-down and dilapidated. Determined to have a good time, nonetheless, they get into the hot tub and booze up. They wake up to find themselves hungover and in 1986, reliving their past and trying to avoid ""the butterfly effect"" of altering the future by changing events of the past. From there, they get into a series of R-rated adventures with the requisite nudity and drunken sophomoric shenanigans. Everything wraps up neatly at the end with all strings tied and everyone happy.As usual, slapping ""UNRATED"" on the box in slanted red capital letters is just a marketing ploy. It's really just two short scenes involving a topless woman and quite mundane. We also see several instances of Corddry's bare butt. I do not know how different the language is from the rated version, but Robinson and Corddry are as terrifically foul-mouthed as ever. They're paired for much of the later half of the movie, and together get into some very raunchy adventures, producing some of the funniest moments in the film and some memorable lines from Robinson (mostly due to his comical expletives and shouting). He does a lot of cursing, like his potty-mouthed barista character inZack and Miri Make a Porno. The counter-point is John Cusack, who turns in a solid performance as the more level-headed member of the bunch. There's a running gag with the porter (Crispin Glover) losing his arm and Chevy Chase makes a cameo as an annoyingly dour and cryptic hot tub repairman.As for complaints, the movie could've used more 80's-ness. Aside from a few sight gags all shown within 5 minutes of them arriving back in time (brick-sized cell phone, Ronald Reagan on TV, Miami Vice t-shirt, the famous Duran Duran poster by Patrick Nagel, leg-warmers) and references to 80's hair metal, the movie seems to drop this fiction pretty quickly in its art direction and dialog. I never felt a sense of nostalgia and most of the film still felt like it was happening in 2010. 80's songs play a prominent part in this film, but a lot of the musical selection I didn't recognize (or just didn't hear because it was in the background). Being a child of the 80's, most of the songs that I think of as quintessentially 80's were not here, like Boy George, Phil Collins, Madonna, Journey, etc, possibly due to licensing costs.All in all, still a lot of fun if you're in the mood for a silly, and very raunchy good time.

This is probably going to appeal to male teens and a few adults, but I don't see much market beyond this because it is basicly about 3 men and a teenager that travel back to the 1980s in a hot tub. They were so incredibly drunk at the time it takes them some time to realize what happened and how to track down the engineer, Chevy Chase, that can fix it. The biggest laugh is when a squirrel interrupts a touchdown play on TV that two of the men bet all their money and and one has to perform a sex act on the other. Does that sound like a movie you want to watch? Didn't think so unless you bullied teenagers in high school because I assure you the nerds don't reflect fondly on that time.

1304029,A11ZESNK9JXTHR,B002ZG97XI,Coffee Klatch Reviews,"[2, 7]","Filthy in spots, like the after-orgy water in a hot tub with a broken filter. Don't go in if you can avoid it, but if you must, bring a towel and some Dawn, because afterward you'll immediately want to cleanse off the muck. Everything about this film is non-subtle, from the clunky expediency with which the characters are transported into the past to the almost pornographic man-on-man love scene halfway through the movie. In two cases this movie would be porn except for the camera angles.At the beginning of the film we see that each of the adults has a life problem. (The kid's problem -Jacob, played appealingly by Clark Dude--is that he has no life: he spends all his time in the basement living vicariously as a character in Second Life.) Adam (John Cusack) comes home to find that his wife has just left him. Nick (Craig Robinson) works as a dog groomer, when he wanted to be a singer. And Lou (Rob Corddry) has just attempted suicide by running his car's engine in his garage. In order to cheer him up, Adam and Nick pick Lou up from the hospital and take Lou back to Kodiak Valley Ski Resort where they had some of the best times of their lives. Jacob is dragged along against his will. He not only would rather get back to Second Life, but he and Lou hate each other.At the lodge, they're in the hot tub, when someone spills a ""Chernobly"" energy drink onto the controls of the hot tub and they are transported back to 1986. The questions will be: Can Adam make a better choice in women? Can Nick do something now that will help him to avoid his fate as dog's butt washer and henpecked husband? Can Lou use his knowledge of the future to figure out a way to make money? (He's thinking along the lines of combining Twitter and Viagra.) Can they get their one remaining can of Chernobly back, which the patriotic ski boys think is some new kind of Russian energy. And since this is the weekend that Jacob was conceived, can he keep an eye on his slutty mom (Collette Wolfe), see who she was hanging out with, and find out who his father is? Did I mention that he and Lou hate each other? (This may seem like a spoiler, but only a toddler wouldn't see it coming the minute it's mentioned early in the film.)Going back to 1986 gives the filmmakers plenty of opportunities to show leg warmers and kids with weird hair styles. Sadly, someone should inform them that this alone does not constitute humor. And neither does watching lots of BJs (including male on male), fake ejaculate on faces, banging a mother as her son looks on, and so forth. I was surprised that the film makers restrained themselves enough to stop just short of any shots of penetration. Maybe the actual acts are captured on the bonus materials. It's obvious that the filmmakers' talents would be better served with careers in porn.The one redeeming element of the film was a running gag with Crispin Glover as the porter at the lodge. When we first see him in the present he's missing an arm and has the worst (funniest) attitude as, with his one arm, he tosses the gang's luggage all over the floor then holds out his one hand for a tip. Presumably he can get away with this because, what, you're not going to tip the disabled guy? But when the gang goes back into the past, they see that he has both arms. How'd he lose his arm? This becomes a running gag, with close calls throughout the film. But like everything else in this movie that is so blunt, when the moment finally comes, it's ruined as Lou unbelievably jumps up and down in celebration. Right.Chevy Chase has a very bland role as the hot tub repairman. If only he could have been plucked out of one of his 80's movies, maybe there would have been a laugh in one of these scenes.2 stars (out of 5) (Generosity due to the Crispin Glover bit.)",2,Hot Tub Slime Machine,1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,3782,"['Filthy', 'spots', 'after-orgy', 'water', 'hot', 'tub', 'broken', 'filter', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'can', 'avoid', 'must', 'bring', 'towel', 'Dawn', ""'ll"", 'immediately', 'want', 'cleanse', 'off', 'muck', 'Everything', 'film', 'non-subtle', 'clunky', 'expediency', 'characters', 'are', 'transported', 'past', 'almost', 'pornographic', 'man-on-man', 'love', 'scene', 'halfway', 'movie', 'two', 'cases', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'porn', 'camera', 'beginning', 'film', 'see', 'adults', 'life', 'problem', 'kid', 'problem', '-Jacob', 'played', 'appealingly', 'Clark', 'Dude', 'life', 'time', 'basement', 'living', 'vicariously', 'character', 'Second', 'Life', 'Adam', 'John', 'Cusack', 'home', 'find', 'wife', 'just', 'left', 'Nick', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'dog', 'groomer', 'when', 'wanted', 'be', 'singer', 'Lou', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'just', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'running', 'car', 'engine', 'garage', 'order', 'cheer', 'up', 'Adam', 'Nick', 'pick', 'Lou', 'up', 'hospital', 'take', 'Lou', 'back', 'Kodiak', 'Valley', 'Ski', 'Resort', 'where', 'had', 'best', 'times', 'lives', 'Jacob', 'dragged', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'rather', 'get', 'back', 'Second', 'Life', 'Lou', 'hate', 'other.At', 'lodge', ""'re"", 'hot', 'tub', 'when', 'someone', 'Chernobly', 'energy', 'drink', 'controls', 'hot', 'tub', 'are', 'transported', 'back', '1986', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'Can', 'Adam', 'make', 'better', 'choice', 'women', 'Can', 'Nick', 'do', 'something', 'now', 'will', 'help', 'avoid', 'fate', 'dog', 'butt', 'washer', 'henpecked', 'husband', 'Can', 'Lou', 'use', 'knowledge', 'future', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'make', 'money', 'thinking', 'lines', 'combining', 'Twitter', 'Viagra', 'Can', 'get', 'one', 'remaining', 'can', 'Chernobly', 'back', 'patriotic', 'ski', 'boys', 'think', 'new', 'kind', 'Russian', 'energy', 'weekend', 'Jacob', 'was', 'conceived', 'can', 'keep', 'eye', 'slutty', 'mom', 'Collette', 'Wolfe', 'see', 'who', 'was', 'hanging', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'father', 'Did', 'mention', 'Lou', 'hate', 'other', 'may', 'seem', 'spoiler', 'only', 'toddler', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'minute', 'mentioned', 'early', 'film', 'Going', 'back', '1986', 'filmmakers', 'plenty', 'opportunities', 'show', 'leg', 'warmers', 'kids', 'weird', 'hair', 'styles', 'Sadly', 'someone', 'should', 'inform', 'alone', 'not', 'constitute', 'humor', 'watching', 'lots', 'BJs', 'including', 'male', 'male', 'fake', 'ejaculate', 'banging', 'mother', 'son', 'so', 'forth', 'was', 'surprised', 'film', 'makers', 'restrained', 'enough', 'stop', 'just', 'short', 'shots', 'penetration', 'Maybe', 'actual', 'acts', 'are', 'captured', 'bonus', 'materials', 'obvious', 'filmmakers', 'talents', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'served', 'careers', 'porn.The', 'one', 'redeeming', 'element', 'film', 'was', 'running', 'gag', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'porter', 'lodge', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'present', 'missing', 'arm', 'worst', 'funniest', 'attitude', 'one', 'arm', 'gang', 'luggage', 'floor', 'then', 'out', 'one', 'hand', 'tip', 'Presumably', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'because', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'tip', 'disabled', 'guy', 'when', 'gang', 'back', 'past', 'see', 'arms', 'How', ""'d"", 'lose', 'arm', 'running', 'gag', 'close', 'calls', 'film', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'so', 'blunt', 'when', 'moment', 'finally', 'ruined', 'Lou', 'unbelievably', 'up', 'down', 'celebration', 'Right.Chevy', 'Chase', 'very', 'bland', 'role', 'hot', 'tub', 'repairman', 'only', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'plucked', 'one', '80', 'movies', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'laugh', 'one', 'scenes.2', 'stars', '5', 'Generosity', 'due', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'bit']",Hot Tub Time Machine
1304030,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B002ZG97XI,Compay,"[6, 9]","Mix one part Back to the future with one part The Hangover, and you've got the recipe for Hot Tub Time Machine.  And while this bromance movie may not reach the cult status of either, it's still a funny comedy that can be enjoyed by young and older audiences alike.If you enjoy your comedy flicks with a good dose of raunchy humor and the occasional gross-out scene, Hot Tub delivers.  While it may not offer nonstop laughs, it's funny enough to anyone born in the 90's, and older audiences will love the sneaky 80's references.  In the spirit of that era's raunchy comedies, viewers are also treated to closeup shots of sexy Jessica Par&eacute;'s weapons of mass distraction.  And aside from the obligatory naked guy butt shots, the film contains no dudity.The four lead actors have a great chemistry, but Rob Corddry easily steals the show as the hyperactive born loser of the bunch.  Stand-up comedian Craig Robinson (Pineapple Express, The Office) also sneaks in some hilarious scenes, including a few surprise cover performances.  Funnyman Chevy Chase oddly gets only a few quick scenes in the film, though Crispin Glover's (George McFly) performance as a quirky hotel porter makes for a great running gag.  Even William Zabka (Johnny from Karate Kid) gets a well-deserved inclusion into the movie.The film's end, and especially its twist, are a bit predictable.

1304032,AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,B002ZG97XI,DanD,"[2, 3]","Here's the thing about HOT TUB TIME MACHINE: it's a movie called HOT TUB TIME MACHINE.  If that doesn't immediately put you off, then you should probably watch it.For those of you looking for some summary: three middle-aged guys (Adam, Nick, and Lou) are having a bad time of it.  Together (along with Adam's nephew Jacob) then decide to go to a ski resort where they partied like rock stars in the 80's.  Except they find the place utterly dead.  The only remotely interesting thing there is the hot tub.  They all get in (four dudes naked in a hot tub, perfectly normal), get drunk, pass out, and come to in the 1980s.  There's a creepy old hot tub repairman (ladies and gentlemen, Chevy Chase!) who may or may not have something to do with time travel.  There are hot chicks and cool dudes.  And Adam, Nick, and Lou?  They're kids again, ready to re-live the best days of their lives.  Except something strange is happening to Jacob...and really, it's very, very hard to do the same thing twice, when you know you'll get your butt kicked, get a fork in the eye, and generally suffer the ravages of adolescence all over again.  It's so tempting to change things...Does that make any sense?  Probably not.  But it's not really supposed to; HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is about four guys bonding and having a good time, finding themselves and each other...along with sex jokes, other dirty jokes, and generally the sort of humor we've come to associate with Rob Corddry and Craig Robinson (both of whom shine here, by the way).  Clark Duke is pretty good as Jacob, too, but John Cusak is the real star here (no offense to the rest of the cast).  He brings the same amount of integrity he brings even to his worst movies; this isn't among that category, thank God, but it's nowhere near as good as his best comedies.  HOT TUB is something of an amalgam of eighties sex comedies and 21st century sex comedies; there's the heart of the former, with the utter disregard of the latter.  It creates an interesting blend that doesn't quite surpass the sum of its parts, as it should.  Still, if you're looking for a good time, you could do worse.  But again, it all hinges on the title: does a movie named HOT TUB TIME MACHINE sound like your kind of thing?  Normally you can't judge a movie by its title; here, you can.  So judge away.

Sorel ""book lovah""","[0, 1]","Hot Tub Time Machine caught my glance when it first came out and I pounced at the opportunity to watch John Cusak, Rob Corddry, and Craig Robinson poke fun at each other and the year 1986. Within a half an hour, I was bored and disappointed.Cusak, Corddry and Robinson are all friends who have somehow gone astray in their personal lives and their friendship with each other. When Corddry tries to commit suicide, Cusak and Robinson come to see him in the hospital where the gang starts to reminisce about the time that they spent at a ski lodge in 1986. The three decide to return to the lodge to do some much needed bonding and bring Duke along for the ride. The four men start drinking and soon find themselves partying in the hot tub. As the title states, the hot tub transports the men to 1986 which just happens to be the year that Duke was born. They make a pact to relive the night exactly as they had 24 years ago so that they can return to the present. Of course things don't always go as planned and hilarity ensues.Unfortunately, I found very little hilarity in this film. I chuckled a few times at the period clothing, fear of Russia and communism, and the music. But those were the only jokes that I found even remotely humorous. Otherwise, it was just your typical ""American Pie"", ""Euro Trip"" romp which is fun for the first while but I couldn't help but feel that many of the jokes are now old hat.

A running gag involving the possibility of him losing his arm is some of the funnier stuff I have seen in some time.Is the film perfect?

The way I see it, John Cusack's massive appeal cancels out Chevy Chase's patented mugging. This still doesn't make HOT TUB TIME MACHINE watchable beyond a certain frat boy level. However, in that frat boy wheelhouse, this film's a laugh riot. To start with, I love the hell out of the film's title.When life gives you lemons, you can choose to make lemonades. Or you can squirt the lemons in your eyeball. Cusack plays Adam, one of the three childhood friends and losers-in-life who serve as our core characters. Adam is an insurance agent whose woman had left him and whose wise aleck 20-year-old uber-nerd nephew Jacob (Clark Duke) has permanently camped out in his basement. Somewhere along here, we meet Nick (Craig Robinson), once the front man of a band but now a sad sack stuck in a dead end career in pet care. When news hits Adam and Nick of the attempted suicide by their old party animal pal, Lou a.k.a. ""Violator"" (Rob Corddry), it reunites the old gang. Having fallen out of touch, the three decide to relive the best weekend of their lives, spent in the snowy Kodiak Valley ski resort back in 1986 when they were kids. Adam's nephew, Jacob, tags along, because who doesn't want a chubby young geek as a wingman?Except that the ski resort nowadays is a mostly deserted dump. And that ill-tempered one-armed bellhop (Crispin Glover) is surely putting out creepy vibes. Still, these four losers are up for one night of drunken revelry. And, oooh, is that a hot tub? They jump in the hot tub, and if you've glanced at the film's title, you should be able to make that intuitive leap.""It must be some kind of hot tub time machine..."" The quartet wake up the next morning to find themselves somehow transported to 1986, back to that very same weekend they'd been hearkening back to. Back to 1986, era of leg warmers, Red Dawn, MTV when it actually showed music videos, and Eddie Murphy when he was funny. Adam, Nick, and Lou learn that the inhabitants of 1986 perceive them as teenagers, as they'd originally looked in that time, and that familiar events are unwinding as they once did. Can these tourists in time find their way back to their own time, and do it without destroying the space/time continuum? Even if it means that Adam gets stabbed in the eye with a fork again?If you're in the mood for gross out humor, then this is up your alley. HOT TUB TIME MACHINE is a sort of a bromance by way of smutty screwball farce. It trots out an unrelenting arsenal of pervasive language, raunchiness, nudity, and Chevy Chase as a mysterious repairman. There are so many f-bombs dropped in this one that even Lenny Bruce is all apologetic. The story has fun playing with time paradox, whether it's the Violator's surefire sports wager backfiring, Nick's introduction of a Black Eyes Peas joint to the 1986 crowd or his insane phone call to his future wife (who in 1986 is a nine-year-old girl), or a key subplot which threatens Jacob's very existence.John Cusack, ostensibly the lead actor, takes a back seat to Rob Corddry who ends up stealing all the scenes as Lou the Violator. You have to admire Corddry for throwing himself into the role with such abandon. In a sick kind of way, his performance approaches near virtuoso levels. He pretty much tops up his quota of cusswords within the first few minutes. He says stuff that make you cringe, except that, inside, you wish you had the sac to say them. He almost deserves his getting the last laugh. HOT TUB TIME MACHINE falls into my own wheelhouse, me being a child of the '80s. I, too, remember when Michael Jackson was black.

From the title to the closing credits, this movie is an absurd, preposterous concept that absolutely works and had me crying tears of laughter.Four downtrodden, depressing friends get together for a wild male weekend full of cavorting and camaraderie at a ski resort.  This ski resort is special because it's where three of them had some of the most memorable experiences of their lives in the 80's, and the trip is meant to reinvigorate youthful momentum and break adult monotony.  Unfortunately, the resort is now in shambles, not nearly what they remember, and depressing as hell.  Not what they expected.  When the four decide to obnoxiously drunk in a hot tub, you know what happens next: They are transported back to their debaucherous and exciting 20-something lives of Winterfest '86 where they careened recklessly down the slopes, dove face firstScarface-style into mounds of drugs, and bedded bimbo ski bunnies dressed in atrociously colored yet wonderfully form-fitting 80's attire (spandex is a privilege, not a right).  The rest is side-splitting comedy, as the foursome must make every attempt to make their way ""Back to the Future"" while possibly righting past wrongs.The main cast (John Cusack, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry, Clarke Duke) is perfect together.  Tons of chemistry.  The supporting cast is just as good: Chevy Chase is the aloof hot tub repairman; William Zabka is the same character William Zabka always plays; and Crispin Glover is the oddball, one-armed* bellhop (a great touch considering his McFly roots in Back to the Future).  It's just too bad they couldn't find a bit role for Michael J. Fox.  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the FACT that Rob Corddry absolutely steals every scene.With 80's references to pop-culture, music, fashion, politics, and everything else, the movie is packed full of hilarity.  When Robinson gets onstage to relive his musical glory days, I defy you not to bob your head and snicker at his ""new"" song.  When Corddry wakes up hungover in the hot tub and says hello to a squirrel in his own special way, there is no way you don't laugh.  And the ""gag"" joke between Zabka and Corddry is epic.  With the exception of the awkward insertion of a new love interest for John Cusack - a subplot never fully developed - the entire film is a compounded running joke that will evoke great memories for those who are fond of the era, mixed with various forms of laugh out loud comedy.  Add in an awesome soundtrack and a predictable yet completely fulfilling twist ending (it's the ultimate what if we all imagine if we were allowed to time travel), and this movie is easily the most enjoyable of the year.  While not quite on par with the cult status Hangover deserves, this film is very comparable, quotable, and hilarious.",5,Great White Buffalo...great white buffalo,1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,2935,"['understand', 'meaning', 'great', 'white', 'buffalo', 'alluded', 'HTTM', 'can', 'unequivocally', 'say', 'film', 'great', 'white', 'buffalo', 'title', 'closing', 'credits', 'movie', 'absurd', 'preposterous', 'concept', 'absolutely', 'had', 'crying', 'tears', 'laughter.Four', 'downtrodden', 'depressing', 'friends', 'get', 'together', 'wild', 'male', 'weekend', 'full', 'cavorting', 'camaraderie', 'ski', 'resort', 'ski', 'resort', 'special', 'where', 'three', 'had', 'most', 'memorable', 'experiences', 'lives', '80', 'trip', 'meant', 'reinvigorate', 'youthful', 'momentum', 'break', 'adult', 'monotony', 'Unfortunately', 'resort', 'now', 'shambles', 'not', 'nearly', 'what', 'remember', 'depressing', 'as', 'hell', 'Not', 'what', 'expected', 'When', 'four', 'decide', 'obnoxiously', 'drunk', 'hot', 'tub', 'know', 'what', 'next', 'are', 'transported', 'back', 'debaucherous', 'exciting', '20-something', 'lives', 'Winterfest', 'where', 'careened', 'recklessly', 'slopes', 'dove', 'face', 'firstScarface-style', 'mounds', 'drugs', 'bedded', 'bimbo', 'ski', 'bunnies', 'dressed', 'atrociously', 'colored', 'yet', 'wonderfully', 'form-fitting', '80', 'attire', 'spandex', 'privilege', 'not', 'right', 'rest', 'side-splitting', 'comedy', 'foursome', 'must', 'make', 'attempt', 'make', 'way', 'Back', 'Future', 'possibly', 'righting', 'wrongs.The', 'main', 'cast', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Clarke', 'Duke', 'perfect', 'together', 'Tons', 'chemistry', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'aloof', 'hot', 'tub', 'repairman', 'William', 'Zabka', 'same', 'character', 'William', 'Zabka', 'always', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'oddball', 'one-armed*', 'bellhop', 'great', 'touch', 'considering', 'McFly', 'roots', 'Back', 'Future', 'just', 'too', 'bad', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'bit', 'role', 'Michael', 'J', 'Fox', ""'d"", 'be', 'remiss', 'did', ""n't"", 'mention', 'FACT', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'absolutely', 'scene.With', '80', 'references', 'pop-culture', 'music', 'fashion', 'politics', 'everything', 'else', 'movie', 'packed', 'full', 'hilarity', 'When', 'Robinson', 'onstage', 'relive', 'musical', 'glory', 'days', 'defy', 'not', 'bob', 'head', 'snicker', 'new', 'song', 'When', 'Corddry', 'up', 'hungover', 'hot', 'tub', 'hello', 'squirrel', 'own', 'special', 'way', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'gag', 'joke', 'Zabka', 'Corddry', 'epic', 'exception', 'awkward', 'insertion', 'new', 'love', 'interest', 'John', 'Cusack', 'subplot', 'never', 'fully', 'developed', 'entire', 'film', 'compounded', 'running', 'joke', 'will', 'evoke', 'great', 'memories', 'who', 'are', 'fond', 'era', 'mixed', 'various', 'forms', 'laugh', 'loud', 'comedy', 'Add', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', 'predictable', 'yet', 'completely', 'fulfilling', 'twist', 'ending', 'ultimate', 'what', 'imagine', 'were', 'allowed', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'easily', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'year', 'not', 'quite', 'par', 'cult', 'status', 'Hangover', 'film', 'very', 'comparable', 'quotable', 'hilarious']",Hot Tub Time Machine

But I can tell you that not only was the story a believable romp in the bushes of fantasy, but it was played perfectly by all in attendance.  John Cusack was superb, as always, in his leading role, and very reminiscent of his fabulous straight-guy-type work from the string of awesome movies he performed in earlier in his career.  But the real stars here were his two buddies, played by Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry.  Those guys carried this movie from start to finish.  They had always been on the outskirts of many comedies, but it was nice to see them show the movie-going populace their talents and superb abilities in the realm of goofy, empty-headed comedy.There were many laugh-out-loud moments, but even when there weren't, the implication that the whole future could be changed and the possibility that newcomer Clark Duke's character could be erased forever if any mistakes were made in the process of getting back to the present, kept me riveted to the screen.  I didn't find myself looking at the clock as I so often do with mid- to low-range comedies to anticipate the movie's much-coveted ending; it was fun and well-acted.

I think that was it anyway, from ""Better off Dead"".  I am sure everyone also remembers Lloyd Dobler and his persistent pursuit of the teenage love of his life.  I could venture on with Cusack's accolades but needless to say, the man was, and still is, an awesomely talented actor.  So I always have higher expectations for his movies, even the ones I anticipate to be filled with vulgar humor, and little thought.  Puking scenes can be funny if they are appropriate and fill the screen with something more than spewing chunks.  I guess that is why I left this movie feeling disappointed.Cusack, Craig Robinson and Rob Corddry are three friends in the middle of a mid life crisis.  They are meandering their way through misery as Cusack's girlfriend has left him, Craig Robinson's wife is cheating on him and Rob Corddry is attempting to kill himself.  In an attempt to rekindle old passion and keep an eye on Corddry, who is denying being suicidal, the three head up to their old stopping ground for a weekend of skiing.  Clark Duke tags along as the nephew of Cusack, and seems to add sanity to the three adult lost souls.What they find is a dilapidated remnant of their youth in a town that mirrors the wasted life the three men seem to be wallowing in.  The only remedy seems to be stripping naked and jumping in the hot tub while consuming huge amounts of alcohol.  Bam, one thing leads to another and when they wake up, still in the hot tub mind you, they find themselves transported back to the eighties.  My favorite line of the movie is when Craig Robinson asks some random girl what color Michael Jackson is.  He freaks out when she says he is black of course.I think you have to be middle aged to appreciate the truly scary clothes that we seemed to have worn in the eighties.  What in the hell were we thinking.  The four guys try to relive their weekend in the resort as they did when they were young to keep from distorting the time warp continuum, but like all of us, there are just some things that a person would enjoy changing.  I mean if you could go back in time, would you really want things to end up exactly like they are today.There is a lot of sex, drugs, cursing and yes, even a spewing vomit scene.  I actually think there are two vomiting episodes but one is pretty drawn out.  I laughed out loud on several occasions and spent many moments wondering why I was watching the movie.  It seems to be filled with several ups and downs for us as viewers.  If the writing had been a little better and the directing slightly more on cue the movie had the potential to be a very good comedy.  As it stands I came away thinking it was mediocre but worth watching OnDemand, after having a few beers and lying on the couch.  I would suggest watching it without your girlfriend though.  I don't think mine appreciated it that much.Bottom line, average movie with a few laughs, but I wouldn't let me kids watch it.  The R rating is well deserved.  As far as John Cusack movies go, this one would be near the bottom, but everyone deserves a mulligan now and then.  Even if you have to venture back to the eighties to figure out how to find your fame, fortune and happiness.

That's why i had to give it 5 stars !When a movie makes you repeatedly wipe away tears , with its vulgarity and crudity , and then has the range to actually have some rare emotional moments that work , you know it's doing something right.I'm not going to spoil any of it.Just watch it with no preconceptions.Rob Corddry deserves an award for his role...i'm not kidding.sometimes you see a performance that is just sheer poetryThis is the movie that The Hangover wishes it could have been.Even though i know TH  made a ton of $ , and was popular , doesn't mean it was a funny movie.Certainly wasn't funny to me.those little flecks of white that people have on their fingernails, that is what The Hangover is when compared to Hot Tub Time Machine.HTTM is a full body of comedy.and again , Rob Corrdry , bravo . Best performance of the year .some of you may disagree.....and it probably does help to have lived through some of the 80's , but my wife was crying just like me , and she wasn't an 80's child at all. beenif you like it really crude , but never insulting ,  you'll love this.....LOVE IT !",5,this is the future of comedy !,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",2010,1973,"['just', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'i', ""'m"", 'giving', '5', 'stars.to', 'best', 'review', 'HOT', 'TUB', 'TIME', 'MACHINE', 'i', 'have', 'bring', 'up', 'something', 'past.A', 'year', 'i', 'watched', 'movie', 'THE', 'HANGOVER.i', 'have', 'pretty', 'dirty', 'sensibility', 'love', 'crude', 'humour', 'same', 'time', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', 'treated', 'dumb', 'comedy', 'drama', 'thriller', 'sci', 'fi', 'whatever.treat', 'audience', 'respect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lose', 'them.The', 'Hangover', 'opinion', 'was', 'big', 'long', 'fart.It', 'got', 'brain', 'aenima', 'just', 'think', 'Alan', 'Arkin', '/', 'John', 'Cusack', '/', 'Grosse', 'Point', 'Blank', 'Never', 'want', 'see', 'again.Horrified', 'hear', 'sequel', 'offing.Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'surface', 'appeared', 'be', 'similar', 'dumb', 'crude', 'comedy', 'i', 'thought', 'just', 'title', 'was', 'going', 'suck.Do', 'not', 'let', 'title', 'sway', 'you.This', 'movie', 'had', 'tears', 'over', 'why', 'i', 'had', 'give', '5', 'stars', 'When', 'movie', 'repeatedly', 'wipe', 'away', 'tears', 'vulgarity', 'crudity', 'then', 'range', 'actually', 'have', 'rare', 'emotional', 'moments', 'work', 'know', 'doing', 'something', 'right.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'it.Just', 'watch', 'preconceptions.Rob', 'Corddry', 'award', 'role', 'i', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding.sometimes', 'see', 'performance', 'just', 'sheer', 'poetryThis', 'movie', 'Hangover', 'could', 'have', 'been.Even', 'i', 'know', 'TH', 'made', 'ton', 'was', 'popular', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'funny', 'movie.Certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'me.those', 'little', 'flecks', 'white', 'people', 'have', 'fingernails', 'what', 'Hangover', 'when', 'compared', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine.HTTM', 'full', 'body', 'comedy.and', 'again', 'Rob', 'Corrdry', 'bravo', 'Best', 'performance', 'year', '.some', 'may', 'disagree', '..and', 'probably', 'help', 'have', 'lived', '80', 'wife', 'was', 'crying', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", '80', 'child', 'beenif', 'really', 'crude', 'never', 'insulting', ""'ll"", 'love', 'IT']",Hot Tub Time Machine

The first 15 minutes have laughs and you think hey its ok gonna be ur average comedy. then about 20 min in it steps up and goes pedal to the medal. In my opinion this movie destroys any comedy that had come out last year. It takes you back to the 80s in one of the funniest ways youll ever see. John Cusak gives one of his strongest performances ive seen, one of his best movies to date. The Storyline while somewhat over the top turned out to be great and very funny. Yes this movie is ridiculous, crude but its hilarious.Alot of ppl compare this movie to the hangover, I feel the hangover is overrated. In my opinion and alot of other ppl ive talked to's opinions Hot Tub Time Machine far surpasses the hangover. Id defanitly recommend this movie to anyone whose in the mood for a fun 2 hours filled with laughs.

This movie however I will recommend blu ray the moment they step into the hot tub while theyre in the 80s until the end when they return to the present time youll want the hd picture it brings out alot of action and details you wouldnt normally see. the sound is better but doesnt need to be, but still Go blu ray if you have a choice.

It's so bad that I (sigh) can't even come up with the words to describe how completely pitiful this movie is. I just can't say how disappointed I am in this film. I wanted to give zero stars but that would've been generous. Amazon should create a rating called ""Hell to the naw!"" for this movie.I am a big John Cusack fan and my mouth had been watering to see this for over a year. I'd waited and waited and waited for it to show up on cable and since it never did, I bought the movie. I can't express how much I wanted to watch this. That's the power of movie trailers, they'll trick you every time.I was beyond disappointed. This movie was a complete dog. If you are like me, expecting The Hangover, forget it! This movie is pathetic.The plot? Oh yeah let me see. A bunch of middle-aged guys go back to some place they used to ski at when they were friends in high school. For some reason, the place is mystical and the hot tub is a time machine. Why you ask? We never know, it just is. So of course they get in the hot tub and from there I got two hours sucked from my life that I'll never get back. I've found cleaning the toilet more entertaining than this.John Cusack must've needed money or something. I slapped myself wondering why the heck he'd be in something like this. If it were funny I could understand but it was horrible. The only thing good about this film was Craig Robinson's performance of The Black Eye Peas' ""Let's Get it Started"". That was the only thing I enjoyed.Another thing. Just because this is a comedy doesn't mean it can't be up on its 80's facts. I'm an 80's child. I know everything there is to know about the 80's. Now one HUGE thing they got wrong was when they mentioned 21 Jumpstreet. Uh, this movie took place in '85. Jumpstreet didn't come on the air until '87. So before they try to do a travel-in-time film, they might want to do more research. But heck does it really matter? This movie was so bad that even mistakes improved it.I don't know what and I mean WHAT Cusack was thinking? Did someone bribe him to be in this movie? How could he look at this script and think it was funny? This movie might've worked in the 80's when low-budget, silly screwball comedies actually had a place but not now. A real crime was how the comedic genius of Chevy Chase was wasted in this garbage. What the heck was he thinking himself? I know the economy is bad but actors need to start investing if it gets to where they get so broke they need to be in mess like this. I think someone has something on Cusack and Chase and forced them to be in this. I can't see them being sane and taking part in this. I am still shaking my head. Even Crispin Glover should be embarrassed by being in this and he's in no position to look down on any roles.On top of it just being bad, it's disgusting. How come comedies starring men have to resort to bodily functions, oral sex jokes and anything else that will turn your stomach? This movie was gross! It has some very sickening moments including two of the friends being forced to almost perform oral sex on each other, vomiting on a squirrel, semen jokes and a raunchy sex scene between Cusack's on-screen sister and the bald friend (whoever the hell he is). Ugh. It says something when sex scenes can't even save a movie.There is no reason for you to watch this movie unless you're dying and wanna be put out of your misery. I would watch ANYTHING before watching this. This is the worst film I've seen in a long time and the worst comedy I've seen in my life.Don't just ignore this but run and save yourself for the love of all that's holy! Run! Run far away and never look back! You think I'm kidding then you actually haven't seen this. The only thing that would be worst is if they made a sequel.

I thought it sounded funny, but one I wouldn't pay to see in the theater. Then I saw the trailer, I thought it looked funny, and I decided ""Eh, why not go see it? Should be good"". Then my friend got an advance showing ticket and he invited me. I thought, ""hey it's a free advance showing, go for it!"" So I did. So anyways, that was a week ago today.Tonight was the screening of the movie. And boy, did I love it or what! This is definitely a movie I would pay to go see again in the theater. From its stellar cast to its substantial amount of crude and gross humor, this is a film that is rude, crude, and unabashedly vulgar- and proud of it. And it's another roller-coaster comedy- the moment you think it'll get boring, it throws even bigger laughs your way. So in that sense, I can definitely say that I am glad I went. It was one hell of a hilarious comedy that kept me laughing.After a stint that almost gets a person killed, his friends who are also unfortunately living rock bottom lives invite him to go on a road trip up to a snowy alpine town named Kodiak Valley, taking one's nephew. The town is practically desolate, and the hotel room is crappy. However, they find out their suite has a hot tub, and they get pretty trashed. Unknowingly, they knock over an energy drink and spill it on the panel.The next morning, they wake up, but things aren't what they seem. For one, everyone's wearing fashion that was made big in the eighties. there's only one logical explanation: The hot tub was a time machine that transported them back to 1986!!!! However, since 3 of them are adults, they also discover they traveled to the day they went there for the Winterfest music festival with Poison headlining. So they decide to re-live the night they'll forever remember, while simultaneously trying to get back to 2010, ending up in several sticky situations along the way!This was a fun movie for sure. It was totally odd yet hilarious. Tons of belly laughs, lots of WTF moments. Cusack sure didn't ruin his career with this one- he is very funny and he proved he can take on a rude and crude comedy very well. Crispin Glover has a small role here, and he really did the deed here too. But, the real star of the show here is someone I usually dislike- Rob Cordry. He stole the show greatly here. He was the real highlight here. He was consistently funny through and had me laughing so hard to the point I couldn't breathe.However, I recommend that you do NOT let kids see this movie. The jokes, as I mentioned are rude and crude and extremely vulgar which almost push an NC-17 rating here. There's tons of sex jokes as well and couple ugly sex scenes that do nothing but add hilarity to the movie. The ending also takes a direction that most comedies nowadays don't. You expect the clich&eacute; comedy ending but you get something here that you are NOT expecting at all, so it gob-smacks you. I wasn't expecting it, and it made the experience even funnier for me.In short, this was an amazing experience that is not for the squeamish and definitely not for the prudish.

(Apparently, reliving past glory is someone's idea of a ""pick me up"" getaway)  Much like the men themselves, the lodge is a hollow shell of its former self, run down and unappealing.But due to some sketchy science involving an illegally imported energy drink spilling on a control panel, their hot tub turns into a time machine that sends them all back to the 80s.  And naturally, they have a chance to relive moments they've always wanted a second chance with.  Can they turn their lives around?  Will they mess up the space/time continuum?  Will raunchy, R-rated behavior ensue?Well, considering the movie is named HOT TUB TIME MACHINE...I hope you can figure out the answers to those questions.  You pretty much know exactly what to expect from this film going into it.  The movie wants to be this year's THE HANGOVER.  But while it has many genuine laughs, it falls short of that lofty goal.John Cusack stars as Adam, a sad sack who has just left another relationship.  He's just sort of slouching through life, and in many ways, even when he returns to his former self, he can't seem to shake the malaise very readily.  He's more or less the party-pooper of the group.  It's fun to see Cusack in an 80's comedy, since he starred in so many great ones (BETTER OFF DEAD being a personal favorite).  I wish the actor Cusack had enjoyed himself a little bit more...he plays too much of the movie straight.  That's a shame, because his co-stars stretch the limits of credibility in their over-the-top performances.Craig Robinson (from THE OFFICE) is Nick.  He's the married friend who has to struggle mightily with temptation from all the young girls throwing themselves at him.  He's a former musician who recaptures his glory days by performing ""Let's Get It Started In Here"" by the Black-eyed Peas for his rapturous audience.  (Funny scene!)  Robinson is the kind of comic actor who gets by on a low key attitude most of the time...but this role actually has him stretch his usual persona just a little, and he does fine.  I wouldn't call it a game changer for Robinson, but it won't hurt his career.Rob Cordry is the perhaps suicidal Lou.  He's crazy and unconcerned for his physical safety, so when he's presented with a chance to relive his crazy youth, he embraces that with insane fervor.  Cordry is a master of being hugely offensive, particularly towards women (he stole his scenes in the forgettable WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS), and a co-starring role stretches the audience's ability to like him.  He chews into his part with gusto, though.  I'd like to see him in a more sympathetic leading role...there might actually be something there.There are a few odd cameos, most memorably from Crispin Glover (an always welcome oddball).  Chevy Chase makes a nearly pointless appearance in a couple of scenes.  And Lizzy Caplan (CLOVERFIELD, MEAN GIRLS, TRUE BLOOD) shows up as someone's love interest.  Her part is underwritten, but she's good enough to pull it off.The movie is just wildly uneven and choppy.  It has the 80's visual aesthetic of PORKY'S and tries to have the pacing and attitude of a Judd Apatow film...but in the end it isn't quite slapstick and raunchy enough to make us laugh all the way through, nor are the ""tender"" parts invested with any real feeling.  There are many funny bits, and I certainly enjoyed myself...but the premise (and great title) led me to hope for something more transcendently silly.  No such luck.Probably good for a rental, particularly if you've got a few folks (adults) over for a few beers.  But it's a near miss for me.",3,Sporadic laughs.

Before you know it the four guys are naked in a hot tub and when the wake up, they discover they are in 1986.

You should not take this movie seriously. If you do, you'll likely turn it off before it really even gets started, and you'll miss out on a lot of laughs. Sit back, relax, and disregard your sanity for an hour and a half.Adam (John Cusack), Nick (Craig Robinson) and Lou (Rob Corddry) are friends who used to go on vacations to a wild ski-resort in the 80s. Their lives are not going as well as they dreamed they would, so they take a vacation to the same resort, and Adam's nephew (Clark Duke) tags along. Once there, they see how much things have changed, but they're magically transported back in time through the hot machine on the back porch.(See what I mean about sanity? That would never happen!)The interactions between the main characters are excellent, because they mimic real-life conversations. They make lame jokes, they poke fun at each other, they make movie references, they give each other bad advice; it's all here.The best thing about this movie is the fact that it makes fun of itself. This is evidenced in a few ways. First, Crispin Glover plays the bellboy, an obvious throwback to Back to the Future in which Glover plays George McFly. This movie is a rip-off of that one, and the fact that it points this out so the critics don't have to is smart. Second, Craig Robinson uses the title of the film in his dialogue, then looks at the camera with a blank face. This ellicits a good laugh, because once again, the film is making fun of itself.

1304129,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B002ZG97XI,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","""Hot Tub Time Machine"" looks like it was a heck of a lot of fun to make and to write.  John Cusack has a well-earned reputation as one of the Smart Guys in Hollywood - always reliable for delivering intelligent, wise, clever lines with humility and perfect comic timing.  Rob Corddry earned his stripes on the brilliant ""Daily Show.""  Craig Robinson never disappoints on ""The Office.""  This movie promises much . . . but unfortunately fails to deliver on its full promise.The plot is well-known.  Three buds and a nerdy nephew go back to the 1980's via the most ridiculous time machine since Bill and Ted were famous.  Virtually all the action takes place at one of those ski towns where everybody wants to ""Party!!!!!""  Especially the nubile and loose bevy of gorgeously big-busted women who I never saw in Whitefish, Montana when I went skiing in the 1980's.  We get a bunch of 1980's-inspired humor, some of it great but some of it rather sophomoric (""What color is Michael Jackson?"" has been done.  A lot.).What ensues is a tepid romp through time-travel cliches, T&A; humor, and some rare moments of inspired hilarity.  The best running gag is the secret of just how Crispin Glover loses his arm (and Corddry's continued aggravation at the arm's series of near-misses).  Indeed, Corddry essentially steals this show as his head-banging, extremely profane Lou gets to exorcise some inner demons.  Corddry's got that gift of being able to look at even the most absurd situation with complete honesty and conviction, strapping on whatever emotional armor is needed to get things done.  Craig Robinson also has some inspired scenes as a man tortured by the apparent infidelity of his modern-day wife, whom he takes to task in a classic phone call even though back in the 1980's she's only nine years old.John Cusack is the biggest puzzle of this movie.  Cusack may be the ultimate scene stealer in Hollywood because he's so memorable and yet so restrained - he can go toe-to-toe with Jack Black in ""High Fidelity"" and still remain the heart of the picture.  But in ""HTTM,"" Cusack is strangely unmemorable.  Usually there is at least one line in a John Cusack movie that you walk out repeating to yourself and saying, ""I wish I talked that way.""  Not in ""HTTM.""I am not certain if the ""Unrated"" edition of this movie is any better than the rated version - it does not appear to be any raunchier, but appears to include a few extended comic scenes that probably ended up on the cutting room floor because they don't quite work.A surprising return to the classic T&A; comedies of the 1980's, ""HTTM"" is by no means a bad movie.

I think it was helpful to go into this movie with my expectations set for an adolescent-minded sillyfest, because that's pretty much what you get albeit with some very adult themes throughout. A perfect movie for me.After the biggest loser of a group of 3 peas in a pod friends seemingly attempts to commit suicide, they embark on a road trip back to a place that they used to go 25 years ago to have fun in order to try to get their friend out of his funk. They find that their favorite resort town has become pretty run down over the years, which only adds to the state of depression overhanging the group. So instead of going out on the town, they get some booze and hang back at the room and hit the Hot Tub, which of course turns out to be more that just your ordinary Hot Tub.The boys are transported back in time and the rest of the movie is a comical and often disgusting chronicle of their fight to get back to the future without causing a Butterfly Effect that alters history.

There is an excess of pointless nudity, f-bombs galore, and a plot as thin as the lines of coke drawn on the mirror in the many drug scenes. Even though this is not a movie you watch to point out the flaws, the 80s version of me demands I point one out: the total cognizance of John Cusack an hour or so after downing `shrooms, coke, pot, and a ton of booze. Somehow he is still John Cusack, i.e. a dronish bore of an actor with a very limited emotional range. To those who claim his career has taken a down slide, I have to ask from where? He's never been that great but he does seem to be fairly ubiquitous, so someone likes to see him in movies. Then again, he plays the same character he always plays - the self-obsessed navel-gazer - so maybe that's the joke. Fortunately he doesn't have to carry the movie. That task is handled joyfully by Rob Corddry, the man who makes this movie work.If you are easily offended and/or don't like the content I've outlined, you will hate this movie.

Of course, they all say ""f"" this and ""f"" that, because that's how boys talk. Of course, they all think that the good old college days were the best time of their lives, and of course a movie like this needs some kind of gimmick - in this case a hot tub - to take them back in time. I didn't mind the hot tub gimmick, but it's too bad that the entire movie was a gimmick.The story couldn't quite figure out if it was in the sixties or the eighties; there was a lot of ""free love"" going on, conveniently leaving out the pre-HIV herpes scare of the eighties. One of the guys sang a little hip-hop at a nightclub - so derivative of Back To The Future. Chevy Chase's role seemed to be as a useless kind of cameo: a time machine mechanic? John Cusack is nostalgic for a girl who stabbed him in the eye with a fork. We get to see Clark Duke's younger mom as a slut (mommy sluts are SO funny!). We get to see Craig Robinson cuss out his 9-year-old future slut of a wife. We get to see man-on-man action as a result of a lost bet - a sort of ""gag"" joke, so to speak. We get to see Rob Corddry upchuck on a squirrel.Okay, so there are a lot of lame and predictable jokes in the movie, but that's not the worst of it, because I actually did chuckle at a few of them. The worst of it was that all of the characters were crass, and the ending was predictably crass. It was a ""happy ending"" for all, but none of them deserved it. These losers ""stole"" the future from a lot of smart people, just for money and the ""good life."" They make Madoff look like a Boy Scout.

I expected a 1980's style sex comedy with gratuitous nudity, potty humor, and a couple of good jokes. That is exactly what you get.Four people with dead end miserable lives go to a resort  that three of them once stayed at back in 1986. They go with the intent to cheer up Rob Corddry, who they believed attempted suicide, when really he just did something stupid. The place is run down and not as they remembered. While drinking in the hot tub they get transported back into time. Chevy Chase makes an appearance as a Hot Tub repair man and hints that they need to do everything the same, or else they might alter the future. Attempting to remember all the bad and good things that happened that night, they go out to reproduce it, finding it equally hard to not to change the past as it is to change it.The movie includes music from 1986 as well as frequent drug use, drinking, and sex.

1304147,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B002ZG97XI,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[2, 4]","Recently, on ""30 Rock"", Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and her date (Michael Sheen) exit a movie theater. We catch them in mid discussion. ""You have a problem with the science of ""Hot Tub Time Machine""?"" Liz asks sarcastically. This is a funny line because the mechanics of the time travel in this film, how they get to the late 80s and back again are so stupid, even this makes us laugh. The time travel isn't the point. ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is a funny, dumb, nonsensical movie designed to do nothing but make us laugh.It is difficult to not like the new film. From the corny title (which perfectly summarizes the film by the way) to the actors who seem to be having the time of their lives playing these characters, to the story itself, which is extremely ribald and raunchy, just about everything in this John Cusack film works. In fact, there seems to be so much crammed into the film, you have to sort of admire the filmmakers for their 'kitchen sink' approach to comedy. No, I'm not kidding. This is a very funny movie and the rare example of a comedy that works more than it doesn't. For every joke that doesn't work, three do. Usually, the ratio is the opposite, if we're lucky.Adam (John Cusack) returns home to find his girlfriend has moved out and taken most of her possessions with her. His younger nephew, Jacob (Clark Duke, ""Accepted"", ""Kick-Ass"") lives in the basement, afraid to venture out into the world. Adam gets a call from Nick (Craig Robinson, TV's ""The Office""), a former singer who now runs a fledgling music studio with his wife. Their old friend, Lou (Rob Cordry (""Blades of Glory"", ""Semi-Pro"", ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart"") is in the hospital and may have tried to commit suicide. Both go visit and quickly decide a to an old ski resort they visited as teenagers is just the ticket to get everyone moving and feeling alive again. Once there, they find the place is a pit, but a strange janitor (Chevy Chase) is trying to keep things going. They head to the hot tub and start drinking. Before long, a strange combination of fluids and circumstances allows them to travel back in time to the mid 80s when they were kids. But they also realize they have to tread carefully and repeat everything they did back on that fateful night. If they don't, they could change things in the present. But of course, none of them is happy, so the possibility of changing things begins to prove too seductive.Once the reunited friends, and Adam's nephew, get settled in and realize the place they have remembered for so many years is now a dump, they try to enjoy their time together and are eager to try the hot tub. When they realize it is in need of a major cleaning, they back away. But the mysterious handyman (played by Chevy Chase) sets things right. Soon, they are diving into the hot tub, drinking copious amounts of booze and energy drinks and enjoying themselves immensely. An incomprehensible event sends the hot tub time machine hurting back to the 80s and the three older men soon realize they are re-experiencing the greatest night of their lives. They all look like their late teen selves, but we see their middle aged personas. They've been given a ""do-over"" but have to work against their inner-self. Do they try to keep everything the same, to maintain the current status of their lives, lives they all hate? Or do they try to change things and use their knowledge of the forthcoming two decades to change and, hopefully, improve their lives?Produced by John Cusack and directed by Steve Pink (""Accepted""), ""Hot Tub"" joins the growing list of comedies designed to generate laughs with gross out humor. And it's funny. Expect at least one character to barf and at least one character to be barfed on. That is the humor level referenced throughout the film.And if that were all there is, it would be a funny but forgettable film. But because they also inject some genuine humor, some jabs at life in the 80s and some genuine emotion, the film becomes even better and more memorable.I want to take a moment to offer an appreciation of John Cusack. Cusack has a long and fruitful career both behind and ahead of him. The reason for this is because he has been able to balance appearances in silly blockbusters (""2012""), appearances that only serve to improve the film, with starring roles in more personable, quirky and enjoyable films. From ""Say Anything"" to ""Gross Point Blank"", the criminally underrated ""Identity"" to the subtle horror film ""1408"", he is always interesting. Even in the terrible, terrible film ""The Ice Harvest"", he manages to make his character watchable, abating some of the growing dread you experience as you sit through the film trying to understand how this piece of crap ever got made in the first place.In ""Hot Tub"", Cusack plays the most normal character, the one with the goals we can most easily identify with. Because of that, he becomes the center of the story, but he is also the least interesting because he is the least outrageous. He is almost, but not quite, the straight man. But without him, the film wouldn't work.Rob Cordry, on the other hand, plays the off the wall character. Lou is ready and willing for anything and to do anything. As soon as they arrive at the ski resort, he begins looking for possible hook-ups. When they return to the 80s, and he now has the libido of a teenager, these desires only increase.Craig Robinson plays Duke, a man who now owns a recording studio and works part time as a dog groomer, giving you an indication of how well his business is doing. His big dream as a teenager was to become a singer, so when they return to the 80s, he realizes he can start over. He accomplishes this in a funny, funny way.Clark Duke plays Jacob, Adam's nephew, who joins them for the ride. He is funny because he provides a sort of running commentary as the conscience of the group. He is also more intricately involved in the story than you might imagine.""Hot Tub Time Machine"" takes necessary jabs at everything ""80s"". The guys' main nemesis is a guy named Blaine (Sebastian Stan), the leader of the Ski Patrol, complete with blonde feathered hair. Craig Robinson's 80's persona has the high, sculpted hair made popular by Kid of Kid 'N' Play. Everyone seems to be using drugs. These moments are fun, but not the best thing about the film and they become a little overworked after a while.The best thing about ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is the fact the filmmakers made the film at all. It is such a preposterous story, executed so tongue in cheek that I would find it difficult for anyone to not enjoy themselves.But beware. The film is rated R and there are some very good reasons for that. But don't let that scare you off. In a way, it only helps to make the science of the Hot Tub Time Machine more believable.",4,Hot Tub Hangover,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,6792,"['Recently', '30', 'Rock', 'Liz', 'Lemon', 'Tina',

1304148,A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B002ZG97XI,Tommy Sixx Morais,"[1, 1]","Hot Tub Time Machine can be described in the same way as its title; ridiculous, stupid and at the same time, funny. Many reviewers have found this movie to be plain stupid and obviously did not get it or simply couldn't get it; HTTM is definitely NOT a smart movie and will certainly not help raise your IQ. Someone who views it could possibly hate it the same way he hated movies such as Superbad I'll be the first to admit that as much as I enjoyed the movie it's dumb, really dumb. But you know what? It's what I like about it, it doesn't try to be smart and it's just a fun movie with this crazy plot that doesn't make much sense. This type of humor will not please anyone and the rating on amazon shows it. But really what do you expect of a movie with such a title?Adam and his friends Nick and Lou (along with Adam's nephew) go to snowy Kodic Valley, a place that holds great memories for them but they quickly realize that a lot has changed since then. Their hotel rooms has a hot tub and that night they do something that makes the hot go back in time, in 1986 precisely (you probably knew that a hot tub was going to be there at some point and that it would act as time machine, no spoilers there). The fun only starts there as they discover that what they do in 1986 could change their futures. Having a fondness for the 1980's in general (especially Motley Crue!) would really help you appreciate the movie, on the other hand if you can't stand 80's references you should stay clear of Hot Tub Time Machine. The movie references Motley Crue, Michael Jackson, Poison and mostly the MTV era, they even captured the clothes, the fashion and all. What really made me like the movie were the characters, Lou and Nick really carried the movie in m opinion.Watching Hot Tube Time Machine may either bring some fond memories, make you hate the 80's even more or wonder why you watched it in the first place. The reviews for HTTM are clearly mixed and not everyone will enjoy it. Oh and the movie clearly earned it's rated R rating, just so you know there is bad language and sex scenes. I like HTTM for what it was, it's a funny stupid movie and should be taken for what it is. 4 stars",4,Hot Tub What?,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,2189,"['Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'can', 'be', 'described', 'same', 'way', 'title', 'ridiculous', 'stupid', 'same', 'time', 'funny', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'plain', 'stupid', 'obviously', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'simply', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'HTTM', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'smart', 'movie', 'will', 'certainly', 'not', 'help', 'raise', 'IQ', 'Someone', 'who', 'could', 'possibly', 'hate', 'same', 'way', 'hated', 'movies', 'such', 'Superbad', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'dumb', 'really', 'dumb', 'know', 'what', 'what', 'like', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'smart', 'just', 'fun', 'movie', 'crazy', 'plot', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'type', 'humor', 'will', 'not', 'please', 'anyone', 'rating', 'amazon', 'shows', 'really', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'movie', 'title', 'Adam', 'friends', 'Nick', 'Lou', 'Adam', 'nephew', 'go', 'snowy', 'Kodic', 'Valley', 'place', 'great', 'memories', 'quickly', 'realize', 'lot', 'changed', 'then', 'hotel', 'rooms', 'hot', 'tub', 'night', 'do', 'something', 'hot', 'go', 'back', 'time', '1986', 'precisely', 'probably', 'knew', 'hot', 'tub', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'point', 'would', 'act', 'time', 'machine', 'spoilers', 'there', 'fun', 'only', 'there', 'discover', 'what', 'do', '1986', 'could', 'change', 'futures', 'Having', 'fondness', '1980', 'general', 'especially', 'Motley', 'Crue', 'would', 'really', 'help', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'other', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', '80', 'references', 'should', 'stay', 'clear', 'Hot', 'Tub', 'Time', 'Machine', 'movie', 'Motley', 'Crue', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'Poison', 'mostly', 'MTV', 'era', 'even', 'captured', 'clothes', 'fashion', 'What', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'were', 'characters', 'Lou', 'Nick', 'really', 'carried', 'movie', 'm', 'opinion.Watching', 'Hot', 'Tube', 'Time', 'Machine', 'may', 'either', 'bring', 'fond', 'memories', 'make', 'hate', '80', 'even', 'more', 'wonder', 'why', 'watched', 'first', 'place', 'reviews', 'HTTM', 'are', 'clearly', 'mixed', 'not', 'everyone', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Oh', 'movie', 'clearly', 'earned', 'rated', 'R', 'rating', 'just', 'so', 'know', 'bad', 'language', 'sex', 'scenes', 'like', 'HTTM', 'what', 'was', 'funny', 'stupid', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'what', '4', 'stars']",Hot Tub Time Machine

Well, such films as 'The Wedding Singer' proved that the 80s can hold its own against other venerable decades. And now there's 'Hot Tub Time Machine', which also takes its own affectionate look at the era when both Ronald Reagan and Michael Jackson reigned supreme.The protagonists of 'Hot Tub' are three losers from California who have remained occasional friends since their weekend at the Kodiak Ski Lodge in the winter of 1986: Adam (John Cusack), a hapless insurance salesman who's just been dumped by his girlfriend; Nick (Craig Robinson), who works at a dead-end job at a dog spa and can't get over the fact that his wife has been cheating on him and Lou (Rob Corrdry), a party animal way past his prime who can't hold a job. Also in the mix is Adam's geeky nephew Jacob (Clark Duke), who is also unemployed and spends most of his time playing video games.The catalyst that brings the three friends back together again is Lou's hospitalization after being poisoned by carbon monoxide (later it's revealed that it actually was a suicide attempt). Concerned with their friend's mental health, Adam and Nick decide to treat Lou to a weekend at the same Ski Lodge they stayed at back in the 80s. With Jacob along for the ride, the three friends are propelled back to the 80s after relaxing in the hot tub on the patio deck of their hotel room.'Hot Tub' is not without its fun moments. Perhaps the best joke in the entire movie is when the protagonists first become aware that they have traveled back in time. Nick questions a waitress as to ""what color Michael Jackson is"" and when she replies, ""black"", he runs out of the ski lodge screaming in terror! Another funny bit is when the trio look in the mirror, they constantly see themselves as they looked back in the 80s.Two 80s acting icons are also part of the cast: Crispen Glover, famous for his role as George McFly in the 1986 hit 'Back to the Future' and Chevy Chase, mainly known for his role as 'Fletch' in the hit movie from the 80s of the same name. Of the two parts, Glover's is superior. He plays a bell hop who appears in the present with a severed arm. While back in the 80s, there are numerous amusing scenes where the expectation is that his arm will be cut off but he manages to somehow avoid the excision due to a series of lucky coincidences. When his arm is finally lopped off, all is made good in the present after we learn that the ski patrol packed the severed appendage in ice fast enough and rushed him to the hospital, where it was reattached. Chevy Chase has little opportunity to trot out his comic talents in the weaker role of the hot tub repairman who merely acts as an adviser to the time travelers, informing them that they must utilize the energy drink Chernobly to jump start the time machine which will propel them back to the present.The bulk of the 'Hot Tub' plot involves the trio's decision not to upset the time-space continuum by sticking to the same script of their 80s foray. Adam's path is perhaps the funniest--he eventually must dump his girlfriend and allow himself to be stabbed in the eye by her. He accomplishes this by informing her that she'll eventually become overweight in her middle age. Adam does work out some positive karma by setting the stage for a romance with a journalist covering a Poison concert, which figures later in the film's denouement.Nick overcomes his insecurities by coming to realize that he's still in love with his wife. He's conflicted at first, feeling guilty while having sex with a groupie but also jealous, eventually phoning his nine year old wife to be, berating her for having the future affair. Eventually he regains his confidence by expertly performing some 80s standards including 'Jessie's Girl' with his teenage band. Less funny is Lou's arc. There's an ugly scene where Lou loses a bet with miscreant with a gun at the ski lodge and almost is forced to perform oral sex on Nick. Eventually, Lou finds his mettle by punching out the leader of the ski patrol (their obsession with Communists would have worked better in a 50s satire but feels out of place here in the era of Perestroika). Jacob also solves the mystery of his parentage when he learns that Lou is actually his father (there's a rather obnoxious scene of 'coitus interruptus' where Jacob disappears after Lou temporarily stops having sex with Adam's sister).In a nod to 'Back to the Future', the protagonist's lives are transformed as a result of Lou's decision to remain in 1986 and build a new life from there. Adam now is successfully married to the journalist and Nick is a record producer. I was disappointed in the protagonists' transformation. I wanted something more for Adam than simply his marriage to a 'good woman' . And Nick unnecessarily remains jealous of his wife for a short time, even after his new found success. Worst of all is Lou who remains the same obnoxious braggart as he was in the beginning of the film and that Lou's success is equated with material gain. What would have been better if Lou had been transformed into a millionaire, but also a philanthropist.It's hard to recommend Hot Tub Time Machine. Yes, it's funny in spots but also can be crude. I know this is a comedy but somehow I felt that the protagonists simply didn't do enough to deserve their transformations from losers to self-actualized good guys.",2,Losers' transformation into

Given the title, you shouldn't expect some finite time travel physics like Terminator or Back to the Future.  It was a movie that you could laugh and follow along with as easily as any other great comedy.  The combo platter of comedians made terrific chemistry.  This movie was destined to be a horrible afterthought of the Hangover, but instead it standed on it's own two feet and differentiated from that film by being its own hilarious animal.The only minor complaint I have is the disc's lack of special features.  It's not something I demand more of usually, when it comes to comedies.  However, there was close to nothing here.  For most blu-ray customers, this should not be a problem though.In a world filled with horrible comedies, this one proves that America still has creative funny juice in it.

Stories employing time travel and alternate reality are interesting because they allow the writer access to a world where he can alter its parameters and explore new possibilities.2.  I like the actors John Cusack and Craig Robinson.I was happy to find that this movie had other actors well-suited to their roles.  Crispin Glover was hilarious as the one-armed bellhop at the ski resort that the guys visit.  I also liked Chevy Chase as the mysterious hot tub repair man.One dramatic device that was used to good effect in this movie is where the guys could see the younger ""1986"" version of themselves in the mirror after experiencing time travel, although they looked like their ""2010"" selves to each other.  Particularly amusing was the ""1986"" version of Craig Robinson's character, whose head sported a 10""-high shock of hair stranding straight up!",4,Good casting greatly adds to fun time travel/alternate reality based plot,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,912,"['was', 'attracted', 'movie', 'two', 'principal', 'reasons:1', 'Stories', 'employing', 'time', 'travel', 'alternate', 'reality', 'are', 'interesting', 'allow', 'writer', 'access', 'world', 'where', 'can', 'alter', 'parameters', 'explore', 'new', 'possibilities.2', 'actors', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Craig', 'Robinson.I', 'was', 'happy', 'find', 'movie', 'had', 'other', 'actors', 'well-suited', 'roles', 'Crispin', 'Glover', 'was', 'hilarious', 'one-armed', 'bellhop', 'ski', 'resort', 'guys', 'visit', 'also', 'liked', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'mysterious', 'hot', 'tub', 'repair', 'man.One', 'dramatic', 'device', 'was', 'used', 'good', 'effect', 'movie', 'where', 'guys', 'could', 'see', 'younger', '1986', 'version', 'mirror', 'experiencing', 'time', 'travel', 'looked', '2010', 'selves', 'other', 'Particularly', 'amusing', 'was', '1986', 'version', 'Craig', 'Robinson', 'character', 'head', 'sported', '10', '-high', 'shock', 'hair', 'stranding', 'straight', 'up']",Hot Tub Time Machine

What ever happen to comedies that use to be funny without all the profanity, sure i say it sometimes and i think everyone uses language once and a while but when is it to much? Well this movie takes John Cusack and his buds back to 1986 through a hot tub time machine which seems clever and witty enough until the actual funny things start. I did have an occasional out loud chuckle here and there but wow then the F bombs were being dropped like it was world war III, i mean every other word! I admit that back in the 80's even animal house had its crude moments, but they were also funny, and nothing like this. This movies just takes itself way to seriously for what it is, heck just make some crude sexual jokes here and there, go along with the plot and be done with it. Chevy Chase(even though aging) was very miss cast as the disappearing maintenance man who keeps showing up throughout the film, dye his hair black, give him some decent lines and he may be funnier! He's a legend and should be given films for himself. So i would definitely pass on this one, i mean there are soooo many movies out there like this that are much better, or just the same. So its nothing new under the sun, just a bunch of bland filth, nasty sexual humor, and stupid drinking, drug using scenes that spoil at the site of them, before they are even finished. So don't go by the trailer and think well this looks good from it, and most people would like it. Wrong. Old School was a far better film, and no where near as foul as this turd of a film.

1304156,AP3B615GM191G,B002ZG97XI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","Considering the state of Hollywood comedies in this day and age, saying that any comedic effort is ""decent"" is a pretty, well, decent achievement.  While no instant classic, ""Hot Tube Time Machine"" is most definitely watchable if you are in the mood for something a little different.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees four pals (John Cusack, Clark Duke, Craig Robinson, Rob Corddry) transported to the 1980s (via a hot tub).  While in that decade as their younger selves, the four compadres must both figure out a way back home and navigate the long-ago culture & atmosphere.The most important part of this review is to say that ""Hot Tub"" does indeed have a tangible plot...separating it from most current comedies.  It isn't just random stoner scenes or all-out raunch.  It is sexually-charged and chock full of profanity, but those elements don't completely obscure a coherent structure and even a few dramatic moments.Besides the period gags, which are usually hilarious, what really makes this movie funny is the acting of those four leading men.  Craig Robinson (Daryl of ""The Office"" fame) nearly steals the show, while Duke & Robinson also shine in their respective roles.  Cusack, playing the ""straight man"", is just okay.  Overall, though, the acting is a cut above most idiot comedies.Overall, ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" is indeed a watchable comedy adventure that will make you chuckle at both the circumstances and the characters.
