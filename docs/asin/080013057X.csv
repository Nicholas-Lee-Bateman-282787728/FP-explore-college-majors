It's one of those movies that you just have to get into, which isn't easy and it is hard to care about the main characters. Dani Payson (Teri Hatcher) is an actress who really will do anything she has to to be a star, and seduces a writer, Jarvis Scott (Robert Patrick) to get the lead in his new play. Jarvis doesn't have all his marbles as it is, after finding the body of his wife after she MAY have commited suicide, hard to tell but you start to feel differently about this scene as the movie progresses. I don't want to give a lot away, and even though the movie is probably best known for it's nudity, it is a great movie that is very intriguing and suspenseful. A must for any real Teri Hatcher fan and Robert Patrick fan.",5,"Looks like trash, but it's so much more then that",998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,941,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'HATED', 'could', 'hardly', 'even', 'watch', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'favorite', 'actress', 'felt', 'had', 'give', 'shot', 'now', 'love', 'weird', 'thing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'WHY', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'have', 'get', ""n't"", 'easy', 'hard', 'care', 'main', 'characters', 'Dani', 'Payson', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'actress', 'who', 'really', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'be', 'star', 'writer', 'Jarvis', 'Scott', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'get', 'lead', 'new', 'play', 'Jarvis', ""n't"", 'have', 'marbles', 'finding', 'body', 'wife', 'MAY', 'have', 'commited', 'suicide', 'hard', 'tell', 'start', 'feel', 'differently', 'scene', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'lot', 'away', 'even', 'movie', 'probably', 'best', 'known', 'nudity', 'great', 'movie', 'very', 'intriguing', 'suspenseful', 'must', 'real', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'fan', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'fan']",N/A

This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!I can enjoy ""B"" movies, and bad movies, but this one is just so totally non-involving that it is not even good enough to laugh at.  I can't imagine that this mess was released on DVD for any reason other than to cash in on Teri Hatcher's current popularity, and to suck the cash out of people who are anxious to see a younger (29 year-old) Teri Hatcher nude.Rent this, if you must, but, wow, there is no reason anyone should want to buy a movie this bad.",1,What Were They Thinking?,1122940800,"08 2, 2005",2005,1142,"['Man', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'were', 'smoking', 'should', 'be', 'illegal', 'first', 'terrible', 'DVD', '4:3', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'dark', 'muddy', 'picture', 'Worse', 'plot', 'typical', 'predictable', 'poorly', 'written', 'Other', 'looking', 'glimpses', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'body', 'sitting', 'fiasco', 'total', 'bore', 'was', 'also', 'surprised', 'how', 'bad', 'Teri', 'acting', 'was', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'much', 'better', 'things', 'was', 'previous', 'probably', 'fault', 'director', 'Erik', 'Anjou', 'third-rate', 'director', 'best', 'who', 'done', 'total', 'two', 'movies', 'one', 'documentary', 'Gee', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'more', 'demand', 'NOT', 'can', 'enjoy', 'B', 'movies', 'bad', 'movies', 'one', 'just', 'so', 'totally', 'non-involving', 'not', 'even', 'good', 'enough', 'laugh', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'mess', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'reason', 'other', 'cash', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'current', 'popularity', 'suck', 'cash', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'anxious', 'see', 'younger', '29', 'year-old', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'nude.Rent', 'must', 'wow', 'reason', 'anyone', 'should', 'want', 'buy', 'movie', 'bad']",N/A
