But I did enjoy the movie and didn't look at how much time is left for the movie to end. I really enjoyed it. It had some twist close to the end which made me question if the hero prisoner will ever survive. Basically I saw him dying twice. So I was unsure if he'd ever make it. But whether he lived afterwards or not, is for you to see. It's a good movie and it is different from the first ''death race'' movie. But I can't say I didn't enjoy it.

""Death Race 2"" offers up a pretty strong cast populated by many B-movie mainstays; Danny Trejo, Ving Rhames and Luke Goss. The film also features a great turn by Sean Bean as the mob boss!The basic story is that the wheel man for a local mob boss gets nabbed after a botched bank robbery. He's sent to a prison the just so happens to stage fights to the death which are then shown on TV. Due to sagging ratings, the prison's owner and the Death Match producer begin looking for something new and exciting to offer.

1387649,A2ORZYOH2IRT9W,B0046BI81W,Jason Dodge,"[0, 0]","The original Death Race (2008) was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, and made with a modest $45 million budget. It pulled in only $36 million in the US, and about $80 million worldwide, which would be just enough to cover the cost (remember, movie theaters get half of your ticket price). It was marketed as a remake of the original film, Death Race 2000 (1975), though Anderson has referred to it as more of a prequel. Apparently DVD sales were strong enough to warrant a sequel, but its straight-to-DVD nature really limits its scope. Several aspects of the plot are never made clear, the writing is really bad in spots, and it takes way to long to even get to the racing, especially when your movie has the word ""race"" in the title. Plus, most people are not going to be aware that this is actually made to be a PREQUEL to both original movies. But, it still is a somewhat enjoyable ride.Luke Goss does a good job as the main character. He's a very likable character, and even though he's in prison for a good reason, there's enough development for him where you still root for him and don't want to see him hurt. Some of the action screens are fairly decent, but i really think that they're much better designed in the last Death Race (2008) movie. But what really hurts this movie is the pacing and writing. In fact, it takes just under 50 minutes for the movie to FINALLY mention the idea of even having a Death Race! That's half the runtime. Then 5 minutes later all of our characters are in there first race! There's absolutely no buildup to the racing: we never see the teams working on the cars, we never see them deciding the best weapons to use, they never explain the rules of the race, and the first time the get to their cars each one has an inmate from the woman's prison ward inside -- but the movie never gives a reason for this. We only see two races the during the last half of the movie, then we get a plot twist that may or may not sit well with the audience, an once things finally start to really get going -- bam, end credits.I liked the main characters enough, but over half the movie doesn't even MENTION the idea of the Death Race concept, and by the time we get to see it, it hits you with an abrupt ending that lets you realize its actually a prequel. Even the writing is going to have you scratching your head a few times. I really recommend picking up the Death Race (2008) movie, and even the original, Death Race 2000 (1975). For both, the entire movie centers around the racing, the characters or more memorable, there are some decent action sequences, and they both leave you wanting more. And after that, then go ahead and get Death Race 2. I know, I just got done picking on it, but it really is still fun. The action isn't too bad, the main characters all have a reason for there motivations (minus one or two), and if all else fails -- it will make you want the watch the other two Death Race movies again.",3,"This Direct-to-Video Release is Lacking, But Still Can Be Fun...",1299456000,"03 7, 2011",2011,2944,"['original', 'Death', 'Race', '2008', 'was', 'directed', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'made', 'modest', '45', 'million', 'budget', 'pulled', 'only', '36', 'million', 'US', '80', 'million', 'worldwide', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'enough', 'cover', 'cost', 'remember', 'movie', 'theaters', 'get', 'half', 'ticket', 'price', 'was', 'marketed', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'Death', 'Race', '2000', '1975', 'Anderson', 'referred', 'more', 'prequel', 'Apparently', 'DVD', 'sales', 'were', 'strong', 'enough', 'warrant', 'sequel', 'straight-to-DVD', 'nature', 'really', 'scope', 'Several', 'aspects', 'plot', 'are', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'writing', 'really', 'bad', 'spots', 'way', 'long', 'even', 'get', 'racing', 'especially', 'when', 'movie', 'word', 'race', 'title', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'aware', 'actually', 'made', 'be', 'PREQUEL', 'original', 'movies', 'still', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'ride.Luke', 'Goss', 'good', 'job', 'main', 'character', 'very', 'likable', 'character', 'even', 'prison', 'good', 'reason', 'enough', 'development', 'where', 'still', 'root', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'hurt', 'action', 'screens', 'are', 'fairly', 'decent', 'i', 'really', 'think', ""'re"", 'much', 'better', 'designed', 'last', 'Death', 'Race', '2008', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'movie', 'pacing', 'writing', 'fact', 'just', '50', 'minutes', 'movie', 'FINALLY', 'mention', 'idea', 'even', 'having', 'Death', 'Race', 'runtime', 'Then', '5', 'minutes', 'later', 'characters', 'are', 'first', 'race', 'absolutely', 'buildup', 'racing', 'never', 'see', 'teams', 'working', 'cars', 'never', 'see', 'deciding', 'best', 'weapons', 'use', 'never', 'explain', 'rules', 'race', 'first', 'time', 'get', 'cars', 'one', 'inmate', 'woman', 'prison', 'ward', 'inside', 'movie', 'never', 'reason', 'only', 'see', 'two', 'races', 'last', 'half', 'movie', 'then', 'get', 'plot', 'twist', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'audience', 'once', 'things', 'finally', 'start', 'really', 'get', 'going', 'bam', 'end', 'credits.I', 'liked', 'main', 'characters', 'enough', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'MENTION', 'idea', 'Death', 'Race', 'concept', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'realize', 'actually', 'prequel', 'Even', 'writing', 'going', 'have', 'scratching', 'head', 'few', 'times', 'really', 'recommend', 'picking', 'up', 'Death', 'Race', '2008', 'movie', 'even', 'original', 'Death', 'Race', '2000', '1975', 'entire', 'movie', 'centers', 'racing', 'characters', 'more', 'memorable', 'are', 'decent', 'action', 'sequences', 'leave', 'wanting', 'more', 'then', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'Death', 'Race', '2', 'know', 'just', 'got', 'done', 'picking', 'really', 'still', 'fun', 'action', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'main', 'characters', 'have', 'reason', 'motivations', 'one', 'two', 'else', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'watch', 'other', 'two', 'Death', 'Race', 'movies', 'again']",N/A

Based on the remarkable fact that this movie was shot on less than 1/10th the Budget of the original, this movie is very well done. And even though the Jason Statham film is superior, pound for pound, I enjoyed this one more. My only stipulation is that it be viewed in the Widescreen format. The regular TV screen format does not do it justice.Now, had I known this movie was about the origin of Death Race Driver Frankenstein, I might have checked it out sooner.  But as it is, I happened to catch an episode of The Vampire Diaries (Episode 12: ""The Decent"")which featured Lauren Cohan (who plays September Jones in this Death Race 2).  She played a Vampire named Rose (Season 2: Episodes 9 through 12), and I was blown away by how charming/enchanting Lauren Cohan was in this particular episode. Her acting was impressive to me. So much so that knowing she was playing a major role, I decided to take a chance on purchasing this Death Race 2 movie.Unfortunately, at first I couldn't find the DVD anywhere.  I had seen it all the time at Best Buy, but it had been out for over a year at that point, and now Best Buy didn't carry it anymore. I was going to see about getting it through Amazon, but when I saw it at Target, I bought it on the spot.  And I was not disappointed.In a nut shell, this is a low budget film that plays more like a feature film.  From the Lead Character to the minor ones, the performances are top notch.  The story itself is very well written with characters that rise above what a low budget film normally has to offer. Taking into account it's rock bottom low budget, I would happily give this movie 4 out of 5 stars. But an honest and more frank assesment would have me giving it 3 to 3.5 stars (okay, maybe even 3.75 stars...yes, I liked it that much) when comparing it straight up with the Jason Statham film.As far as for it's sequel, Death Race 3, I for one am excited to see what the future holds for the Frankenstein character.  And as a FAN, all I ask for is a few things.  Firstly, that they do not change the look of his iconic MASK, and that he continues to drive his Iconic MUSTANG. Frankenstein's Classic Mask, along with the Mustang ARE A MUST. That and as a driver, he has to continue being a TOTAL BAD ASS BEHIND THE WHEEL! Do you hear that ROEL REINE.  As a fan, those aspects are NON-NEGOTIABLE!In closing, I must say that I can only imagine what Film Magic Roel Reine will be able to accomplish when provided with a decent movie budget.  I have no doubt that as a director, he is destined for great things.  My only regret is that for obvious reasons, the beautiful Lauren Cohan probably won't be in the sequel.",4,The Name is FRANKENSTEIN -  Low Budget Masterpiece,1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,2771,"['thought', 'being', 'direct', 'dvd', 'movie', 'would', 'quite', 'frankly', 'suck', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'Based', 'remarkable', 'fact', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'less', '1/10th', 'Budget', 'original', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'even', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'film', 'superior', 'pound', 'pound', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'more', 'only', 'stipulation', 'be', 'viewed', 'Widescreen', 'format', 'regular', 'TV', 'screen', 'format', 'not', 'do', 'justice.Now', 'had', 'known', 'movie', 'was', 'origin', 'Death', 'Race', 'Driver', 'Frankenstein', 'might', 'have', 'checked', 'out', 'sooner', 'happened', 'catch', 'episode', 'Vampire', 'Diaries', 'Episode', '12', 'Decent', 'featured', 'Lauren', 'Cohan', 'who', 'September', 'Jones', 'Death', 'Race', '2', 'played', 'Vampire', 'named', 'Rose', 'Season', '2', 'Episodes', '9', '12', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'how', 'charming/enchanting', 'Lauren', 'Cohan', 'was', 'particular', 'episode', 'acting', 'was', 'impressive', 'So', 'much', 'knowing', 'was', 'playing', 'major', 'role', 'decided', 'take', 'chance', 'purchasing', 'Death', 'Race', '2', 'movie.Unfortunately', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'DVD', 'anywhere', 'had', 'seen', 'time', 'Best', 'Buy', 'had', 'been', 'out', 'year', 'point', 'now', 'Best', 'Buy', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'anymore', 'was', 'going', 'see', 'getting', 'Amazon', 'when', 'saw', 'Target', 'bought', 'spot', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed.In', 'nut', 'shell', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'more', 'feature', 'film', 'Lead', 'Character', 'minor', 'ones', 'performances', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'characters', 'rise', 'what', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'normally', 'offer', 'Taking', 'account', 'rock', 'bottom', 'low', 'budget', 'would', 'happily', 'give', 'movie', '4', '5', 'stars', 'honest', 'more', 'frank', 'assesment', 'would', 'have', 'giving', '3', '3.5', 'stars', 'okay', 'maybe', 'even', '3.75', 'stars', 'yes', 'liked', 'much', 'when', 'comparing', 'straight', 'up', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'film.As', 'far', 'sequel', 'Death', 'Race', '3', 'one', 'am', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'future', 'Frankenstein', 'character', 'FAN', 'ask', 'few', 'things', 'Firstly', 'do', 'not', 'change', 'look', 'iconic', 'MASK', 'drive', 'Iconic', 'MUSTANG', 'Frankenstein', 'Classic', 'Mask', 'Mustang', 'ARE', 'A', 'MUST', 'driver', 'continue', 'being', 'TOTAL', 'BAD', 'ASS', 'BEHIND', 'THE', 'WHEEL', 'Do', 'hear', 'ROEL', 'REINE', 'fan', 'aspects', 'are', 'NON-NEGOTIABLE', 'closing', 'must', 'say', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'what', 'Film', 'Magic', 'Roel', 'Reine', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'accomplish', 'when', 'provided', 'decent', 'movie', 'budget', 'have', 'doubt', 'director', 'destined', 'great', 'things', 'only', 'regret', 'obvious', 'reasons', 'beautiful', 'Lauren', 'Cohan', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sequel']",N/A

1387655,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0046BI81W,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[2, 3]","2008'sDeath Raceis one of the few post-Event Horizonflicks directed by Paul Anderson that actually works and ranks as one of my favorite action movies of the last decade. A follow-up film was inevitable, but it was a bit surprising that it would be a direct-to-video prequel helmed by a director who had never worked in Hollywood. At first glance of its high production values, you'll wonder why it didn't make it into theaters, but unless you're content with the film giving up substance for style, you'll realize why soon enough.The story: sent to the notorious Weyland penitentiary after a botched bank heist, Carl Lucas (Luke Goss,Blade II) will first have to fight for his life in corporate-sanctioned death matches between prisoners and then race for his freedom when the brutal Death Race tournament is enacted.This movie has a couple of good storytelling opportunities in chronicling both the manufacturing of its namesake and the ""birth of Frankenstein""  angle, but it disappoints on both accounts by dropping each into your lap. The titular race's creation is presented as nothing more than a bright idea of the villainous corporate entities (played well enough by Lauren Cohan ofVan Wilder - The Rise of Tajand Ving Rhames ofPulp Fiction) to spike the ratings of their pay-per-views - you don't even see the track or cars being constructed - and I can't help but feel as though the filmmakers were simply ripping offRevenge of the Sithwith how they built up the Frankenstein character, who doesn't even emerge until the last ten minutes of the film.Director Roel Reine has been making a good name for himself on the DTV action scene, but this film's offerings aren't very inspired. For one thing, it features Danny Trejo (Machete) in its cast but he neither fights nor races. There are three of these races, but only two of them are actually Death Races and these don't happen until into the second half of the film. There's some decent stuntwork in each, but these scenes can't hold a candle to the original's: most of the time, the ""action"" is merely the camera swinging around while the cars are driving straight ahead. Very disappointing. About three hand-to-hand fights comprise most of the adrenaline pieces in the movie's first 50 minutes, and though the brawl between Luke Goss and Deobia Oparei (Doom) is decent (they get to use flamethrowers), these also include the single worst fight that returning Robin Shou (Mortal Kombat) has ever been in.Considering that the film was made on only a $7 million budget, its production values are extremely high. Again, the movie *looks* like it should belong in theaters, and I'd be very surprised if director Reine didn't receive more lucrative offers in the near future. However, he overdoes things with dramatic slow-motion shots and sad music during the races: this is definitely not the movie for a ""what madness hath man wrought""-type moment. Nevertheless, the film is more solid than my previous words gave it credit for: the characters are hammy but do well in furthering the story, and I consider it pretty responsible of Roel Reine to focus predominantly on the plot when he realized the action may not be quite up to par. By no means does this prequel matchthe originalor the version it's derivative of, but I have to give it credit for at least being competent...and for its admittedly awesome finale and the comeuppances of most of the major villains.",3,"""I don't care what you're into.

Anderson's surprisingly not bad 2008 remake of Roger Corman's B-movie classic Death Race 2000, Death Race 2 isn't the usual brand of the direct-to-home video awfulness that many would come to expect, boasting some decent production values and a relatively known name cast.  That being said, Death Race 2 isn't anything to write home about, and is nowhere near the guilty pleasure that Anderson's remake was either.  Luke Goss (Blade 2, Hellboy 2) plays a career criminal named Carl Lucas, who finds himself locked up in a corporate-controlled prison, where the televised fights to the death between prisoners (known as Death Match) gradually evolves into the Death Race we all know and love.  It isn't long before he's a marked man when his former employer (Sean Bean) puts a price on his head, all of which leads to the beginning of the creation of the legendary racer identity known as Frankenstein.  There's familiar faces from the first film around (Fred Koehler and Robin Shou reprise their roles) while Ving Rhames and Danny Trejo have small roles, and gorgeous babes Tanit Phoenix and Lauren Cohan provide the eye candy.  While Death Race 2 has a lot going for it, what kills the film are the uber-flashy edits that are just plain sloppy during the action scenes, as well as some at times atrocious acting, and a cliche'-ridden script that is way too predictable.  All in all, if you enjoyed Anderson's take on Roger Corman's Death Race the first time around, you may find something to admire with this prequel, however little that something may end up being.",2,"Not the usual brand of direct-to-home video awfulness, but still nothing to write home about",1295308800,"01 18, 2011",2011,1589,"['prequel', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'bad', '2008', 'remake', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'B-movie', 'classic', 'Death', 'Race', '2000', 'Death', 'Race', '2', ""n't"", 'usual', 'brand', 'direct-to-home', 'video', 'awfulness', 'many', 'would', 'come', 'expect', 'boasting', 'decent', 'production', 'values', 'relatively', 'known', 'name', 'cast', 'being', 'said', 'Death', 'Race', '2', ""n't"", 'anything', 'write', 'home', 'nowhere', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Anderson', 'remake', 'was', 'either', 'Luke', 'Goss', 'Blade', '2', 'Hellboy', '2', 'career', 'criminal', 'named', 'Carl', 'Lucas', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'corporate-controlled', 'prison', 'where', 'televised', 'fights', 'death', 'prisoners', 'known', 'Death', 'Match', 'gradually', 'Death', 'Race', 'know', 'love', ""n't"", 'long', 'marked', 'man', 'when', 'former', 'employer', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'price', 'head', 'beginning', 'creation', 'legendary', 'racer', 'identity', 'known', 'Frankenstein', 'familiar', 'first', 'film', 'Fred', 'Koehler', 'Robin', 'Shou', 'reprise', 'roles', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'have', 'small', 'roles', 'gorgeous', 'babes', 'Tanit', 'Phoenix', 'Lauren', 'Cohan', 'provide', 'eye', 'candy', 'Death', 'Race', '2', 'lot', 'going', 'what', 'film', 'are', 'uber-flashy', 'edits', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'sloppy', 'action', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'times', 'atrocious', 'acting', ""cliche'-ridden"", 'script', 'way', 'too', 'predictable', 'enjoyed', 'Anderson', 'take', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'Death', 'Race', 'first', 'time', 'around', 'may', 'find', 'something', 'admire', 'prequel', 'however', 'little', 'something', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being']",N/A

film lacks the spark and drive(sorry for the pun)that the first one had.This story is a prequel to the first,so we see the genesis of the race itself.The first part of the movie deals with Death Match,the on going and current form of entertainment/fighting,run by Weyland.Before this we are intro'd to Lucas who is the go-to guy for a crime boss by the name of Kane.He dispatches his man to hit a bank.Lucas in turn hires three fellows he has worked with before,but before you can say&#34;who shot the sheriff?&#34;,things go south.While Lucas awaits out front two policemen happen to walk inside.His men ignore his radio call to abort the job.When the smoke clears security guards,the cops and one of Lucas' men are dead.A wild police chase ensues and Lucas gets caught.And of course Lucas will end up on....Terminal Island.Kane is fidgety and thinks Lucas will out his involvement at some point.He hires several men to take Lucas out before he can &#34;rat&#34; him out.Inside Lucas gets his trial by fire and he is soon fist fighting in the Death Match.Weyland,the head of the entertainment company that runs the match itself,is having a problem with the ratings.His announcer/TV host Jones comes up with an idea.That germinates into action and the Death Race is born.To start,there are twice as many drivers as there are cars.They run,punch and kill their way to the vehicles and the race goes from there.The first day three of the nine jacked up vehicles are eliminated.The second day starts out like the first,but Lucas's car gets into problems.He suddenly has no firepower,no defenses,nothing.His car has been sabotaged and one of his fellow racers fires a rocket which flips his car,burning him inside.Lucas comesthisclose to dying,but is saved.His being alive is kept secret so they can create a new character.Because his face has been disfigured due to the fire,they call him Frankenstein.Because Lucas once saved the life of 14K,14K repays his debt by killing the man on Lucas' crew that sabotaged his car,and he has his boss Kane,killed on the outside.The film fades as we see Frankenstein/Lucas driving his car once more.One thing I do insist upon in films is consistency,when possible.I found an appalling error in the film.It is with our first trip(shown overhead)over the bridge to Terminal Island.In the first film with Statham,it clearly showed a bridge protruding from the mainland,leading to the island which ran,at its terminus,to the bridges left.In this film we are clearly shown a bridge out to the island,which now runs to the bridges right.About halfway through the movie,first in schematics,then in overhead shots,they correct this discrepancy by showing it as it was in the first film.VERY sloppy.Goss has the lead here and that whole Statham look about him,but just not half his intensity nor apparent acting skills.It's always nice to see good old Danny Trejo,whose face could pass for the dark side of the moon(j/k Dan!).Ving Rhames I thought was the classiest looking and acting,of all the participants here.He really nailed his character.Watch for Danny Keough in a small part as the doc who saves Lucas' life.I recall well Keough as the corrupt cop in Van Damme's beautifully intense film,Wake of Death.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1.Extras include deleted scenes,and several featurettes.This edition includes both the theatrical and the extended cuts.All in all a let down from the first.Statham is certainly a hard act to follow,but with a so so plot,an obvious inconsistency,and nothing outstanding to make it shine as bright as the first,this one was just not going to be as good.",3,Average prequel fails to come up to the first!,1361059200,"02 17,

Was it the best movie ever? Of course not. But for what it was I thought it was very fun and entertaining. Like another reviewer said it reminded me of a real life ""twisted metal"" video game and it was also very much like running man in a way. That was a bunch of years back, last year Amazon had a super deal on the BR version so I bought it (which by the way, was a much sharper picture and much better sound than the original DVD but that's for another review). Anyways, I watched DR2 using Amazon VOD service last night and I was very satisfied. I don't think that DR2 was in any way better OR worse than the original DR movie. I think they were equal in story, acting, fx, and set. Some people complained that a lot of the same things were used in both movies. That seems kind of an unreasonable complaint to me since this movie is supposed to take place shortly before DR2 so not sure why everything would be expected to be different. You could literally watch DR2 and then DR without skipping a beat. Not many other prequels you can do that with and not be kind of turned off with the difference in film quality between the two. Danny Trejo did an amazing job, like always, and was a fitting prequel to Ian McShane who played ""coach"" in DR. There were a LOT of ties back to DR, not just with the set and cars, but with characters who make appearances in both, such as List and 24K, as well as other references to characters that you will meet later on in DR. I can't understand why people would love DR and think DR2 was such a disappointment. I'm kind of thinking they're going from their memory of DR, rather than a recent viewing of it. But everybody is entitled to their own opinions. I think if you found DR entertaining, you'll also find DR2 entertaining. If anything, I thought there was a little more ""fun"", more funny parts in DR2. For those that have seen it, the scene in the bar with the old warden at the end was hilarious! All praise aside, $26.95 is a RIDICULOUS PRICE for just about any BR movie. If this ever gets down to a more reasonable price, say &lt;$15, for instance, then I will be sure to pick it up. Until then, I would encourage it as a renter only. I would also encourage use of Amazon VOD to watch it! It's not on Redbox yet and TW Cable also doesn't have it on demand.

We see the origins of Terminal Island and the Frankenstein character also how the Death Race was started but unfortunately lead actor Luke Goss is no Jason Statham and the film is stolen by actress Lauren Cohan in a wonderfully evil performance.  With excellent back up by villainous turns of actors Sean Bean and Ving Rhames, and the always welcome Danny Trejo as a helpful inmate, the film holds together with slick action sequences and a taught back up storyline as Cohan glides the film to its explosive conclusion.  Universal provides a nice 1.85 transfer with good Dolby 5.1 sound and the usual making of extras.  With the gore and smashups poured on much more than the original and also Director Paul Bartel's Seventies original, the film is an entertaining bit of eye candy with relentless action from beginning to end, isn't that why we watch these films? It looks like Roger Corman may have another franchise brewing for I saw recently a trailer to 'DEATH RACE 3' which starts the saga anew in a different locale .
