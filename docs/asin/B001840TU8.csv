This is a beautiful drama and Farmiga is absolutely spellbinding. She's a serious and committed actress, I don't think she's ever given a less than performance, she is a true natural. Farmiga plays Sophie Lee, a young wife who's husband has tried to kill himself. She thinks having a baby might help save her husband and their marriage. The problem is the couple are having troubles conceiving and Sophie will do anything she can to get pregnant, even paying another man to make her dreams come true. I highly recommend this movie, it's sweet, romantic, and just so incredibly real. Give it a try, enjoy!",5,Unexpected romance.,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,730,"['Never', 'Forever', 'starring', 'Vera', 'Farmiga', 'kind', 'small', 'indie', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'leave', 'big', 'impact', 'beautiful', 'drama', 'Farmiga', 'absolutely', 'spellbinding', 'serious', 'committed', 'actress', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'given', 'less', 'performance', 'true', 'natural', 'Farmiga', 'Sophie', 'Lee', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'husband', 'tried', 'kill', 'having', 'baby', 'might', 'help', 'save', 'husband', 'marriage', 'problem', 'couple', 'are', 'having', 'troubles', 'conceiving', 'Sophie', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'pregnant', 'even', 'paying', 'man', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'just', 'so', 'incredibly', 'real', 'Give', 'try', 'enjoy']",Never Forever
1158500,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001840TU8,Grady Harp,"[16, 25]","NEVER FOREVER is a well-developed, well-written and well-directed film by Gina Kim, and with an actress with the stature of Vera Farmiga in the difficult lead role, it is frustrating to see that this fine film didn't last on theater screens.  But as with many of the other treasurable small independent films, this one feels even better in the privacy of the home - the small screen somehow allows the powerful emotions of the story to be more focused.Sophie (Vera Farmiga) is the beautiful Caucasian wife of wealthy and respected Korean Andrew (David Lee McInnis) and the couple seem to have it all - looks, a close-knit family, beautiful home, etc. - but there is an underlying tension: Sophie and Andrew have been unable to conceive and bear a child, a fact that troubles Andrew's very orthodox Christian family and profoundly affects Andrew's sense of worth.  Though the couple has sought professional assistance, their marriage remains barren. Andrew's fragile stance results in a suicide attempt and in trying to correct the cause of this tragedy, Sophie decides she will attempt to conceive from a donor. Because both members of a couple must consent to artificial insemination, Sophie's plan is thwarted except for one aspect: visiting the clinic she has selected is a young Korean man named Jihah (Jung-woo Ha) who is attempting to be a sperm donor but is rejected because he is an illegal immigrant.  Overhearing this exchange, Sophie follows Jihah and finally discovers where he lives.  She approaches him with a business deal - she will pay him $300. for each session and when she becomes pregnant she will pay him $30,000.  Jihah is shy at first, but he is working in a meat packing plant and dry cleaners trying to save enough money to bring his girlfriend from Korea to the USA.  Desperate for money  Jihah consents and Sophie begins her visits to him when her cycle is conducive to conception.  The relationship is one of quick polite encounters, careful to avoid interpersonal factors that might make either partner uncomfortable.  But a sense of interdependence evolves, and when Sophie achieves pregnancy, the couple decides to part ways.Sophie's pregnancy at first overjoys Andrew and his family and the couple's future looks bright.  But both Sophie and Jihah are unable to dismiss the intimacy of the relationship they have developed, Andrew discovers Sophie's adventure, and the marriage falls apart while Jihah informs his girlfriend in Korea that he will never be able to bring her to America.  At this vulnerable point the film simply ends - some years later Sophie is at the beach with her son and is again very pregnant and the viewer is left to decide the resolution.Vera Farmiga is even more beautiful in this role than her many other roles and never for a moment loses our empathy and understanding of the decisions she makes.  Both of the men are strong as are the various actors who flesh out the film.  This is a tough topic to relate, but writer/director Gina Kim allows the acts of love to be the memorable echo the film leaves behind.

This film is available for instant viewing there. I wonder if Amazon will allow me to make these statements considering it's a little contrary to their pricing. Anyways let me get on with this film and why it is worthy of being viewed. After stunning performances in films like Running Scared (2006) and The Boy With Striped Pajyamas (2008) and finally this film, I can safely vouch for  Vera Farmiga being one of the finest actresses in the film industry. (The story revolves around a faithful wife, her decisions for her family, never trying too hard to fit in despite being married to a Korean New Yorker) The visuals aren't particularly stunning but it was the music of the film that gave it a nice sentimental touch.

1158503,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B001840TU8,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 4]","Director Gina Kim creates a domestic drama that highlights the strong need many feel to be parents.  Ukrainian/American actress Vera Farmiga won a Best Actress award for the filmDown to the Bonefrom the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.  I had just watched her in a good cameo performance in Jonathan Demme's 2004 version ofThe Manchurian Candidate (Widescreen Edition).  She also played Madeline in the Oscar-winning filmThe Departed (Widescreen Edition).  As Sophie, she is a woman motivated by her strong love for her husband.  Andrew, played by the handsome Korean/American actor David McInnis, feels tremendous guilt over not being able to produce a child.  To keep him from successfully committing suicide, Sophie goes to a fertility clinic.  She sees a Korean man Jihah played by Ha Jung-Woo who is an illegal alien.  Since he cannot earn extra money as a donor at the clinic as an illegal, Sophie follows him & makes her business proposal that he should help her become pregnant.  The plot grows complex as the repeated attempts at insemination create a bond between Sophie and Jihah.  The love triangle comes to a climax as Andrew discovers the tryst.  Farmiga does an excellent job in the leading role.  We can see numerous concerns bounce in front of her eyes.  I also appreciated the spiritual struggle as she attends religious services to please her in-laws without belief.  This changes at the final conflict on the stairwell as she yells out for God's help.  This is a DVD well worth an evening's viewing.

She decided to write and direct a film that captures the personal transformation of an emotionally stunted woman, who in short order, sacrifices herself for the sake of her husband's happiness but ends up finding love, passion and inner peace through motherhood.Vera Farmiga plays the lead role, showcasing her inter-racial Korean marriage to a wealthy New York lawyer. Their inability to have a child has driven a wedge between them that appears to be destroying their partnership. Through a variety of scenes and events, she decides to pay for the ""donations"" of another Korean man to help anonymously become pregnant and save her marriage. The remainder of the film shows the inevitable destruction of her relationship and the consequences of creating such a pact. Several other small plot lines play out to show the culture she lives in, including an overbearing mother-in-law and Korean pastor who both impose their faith-laden ways in trying to make her become pregnant.The film is shot with long scenes of non-dialogue and lengthy views of New York City. The sex scenes are graphic yet passionate, mainly because Vera made all of her intimacy so heartfelt. She is very believable in displaying her transformation, and you realize the film becomes all about her and not the actual relationships. The ending was deliberately vague, but if you look closely at the small details, there are several clues as to what has happened.The DVD has two small featurettes (3 and 7 minutes) that provide little regarding the film. One is shot in Korean with no English subtitles, the other is more of a blooper and gag reel of the actors during filming with no narration. Only 1/5 of the film is Korean with English subs, the rest is all in English. The film is a definite watch for Vera's fans, as the other two cast mates are awkward unknowns and the camera work of New York is sub-standard, but tolerable.",3,Another bold role for Farmiga...,1215993600,"07 14, 2008",2008,2011,"['Gina', 'Kim', 'first', 'attempt', 'big', 'film', 'known', 'actors', 'was', 'courageous', 'project', 'harsh', 'subject', 'matter', 'decided', 'write', 'direct', 'film', 'personal', 'transformation', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'woman', 'who', 'short', 'order', 'sake', 'husband', 'happiness', 'up', 'finding', 'love', 'passion', 'inner', 'peace', 'motherhood.Vera', 'Farmiga', 'lead', 'role', 'showcasing', 'inter-racial', 'Korean', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'New', 'York', 'lawyer', 'inability', 'have', 'child', 'driven', 'wedge', 'be', 'destroying', 'partnership', 'variety', 'scenes', 'events', 'pay', 'donations', 'Korean', 'man', 'help', 'anonymously', 'become', 'pregnant', 'save', 'marriage', 'remainder', 'film', 'inevitable', 'destruction', 'relationship', 'consequences', 'creating', 'such', 'pact', 'Several', 'other', 'small', 'plot', 'lines', 'play', 'out', 'show', 'culture', 'including', 'overbearing', 'mother-in-law', 'Korean', 'pastor', 'who', 'impose', 'faith-laden', 'ways', 'trying', 'make', 'become', 'pregnant.The', 'film', 'shot', 'long', 'scenes', 'non-dialogue', 'lengthy', 'views', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'graphic', 'yet', 'passionate', 'mainly', 'Vera', 'made', 'intimacy', 'so', 'heartfelt', 'very', 'believable', 'displaying', 'transformation', 'realize', 'film', 'not', 'actual', 'relationships', 'ending', 'was', 'deliberately', 'vague', 'look', 'closely', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'several', 'clues', 'what', 'happened.The', 'DVD', 'two', 'small', 'featurettes', '3', '7', 'minutes', 'provide', 'little', 'regarding', 'film', 'One', 'shot', 'Korean', 'English', 'subtitles', 'other', 'more', 'blooper', 'gag', 'reel', 'actors', 'filming', 'narration', 'Only', '1/5', 'film', 'Korean', 'English', 'subs', 'rest', 'English', 'film', 'definite', 'watch', 'Vera', 'fans', 'other', 'two', 'cast', 'mates', 'are', 'awkward', 'unknowns', 'camera', 'work', 'New', 'York', 'sub-standard', 'tolerable']",Never Forever
