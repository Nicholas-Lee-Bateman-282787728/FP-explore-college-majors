Parker is such a talented actress, she is so down-to-earth but slightly neurotic as Kate, a mother of two who has a very demanding job.

1428966,AAZRWLML88IZK,B004UXUWOW,A kids review,"[5, 7]","Writer/director Douglas McGrath has got a couple of good ones on his resume, but his first film in five years was not a welcome return for him. Banking on the star power of Sarah Jessica Parker, coming off the second Sex and the City movie, I Don't Know How She Does It purports itself to be a comedy about a working mother named Kate Reddy who has it all, but must learn how to balance her career, her marriage, and her children. Unfortunately, I didn't really seem to care much about how Kate did it, as the film teetered hesitantly between comedy and drama and relied on hopelessly outdated viewpoints on gender to deliver its message. Despite a supporting cast that included the likes of Greg Kinnear, Pierce Brosnan, and Christina Hendricks, I Don't Know How She Does It is probably best suited as entertainment for those who are looking for just a small taste, just one more fix, of Sarah Jessica Parker in full-on, Sex and the City Carrie mode.",1,I Don't Know How She Does It,1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,951,"['Writer/director', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'got', 'couple', 'good', 'ones', 'resume', 'first', 'film', 'five', 'years', 'was', 'not', 'welcome', 'return', 'Banking', 'star', 'power', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'coming', 'off', 'second', 'Sex', 'City', 'movie', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'be', 'comedy', 'working', 'mother', 'named', 'Kate', 'Reddy', 'who', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'balance', 'career', 'marriage', 'children', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'much', 'how', 'Kate', 'did', 'film', 'teetered', 'hesitantly', 'comedy', 'drama', 'relied', 'hopelessly', 'outdated', 'viewpoints', 'gender', 'deliver', 'message', 'supporting', 'cast', 'included', 'likes', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Christina', 'Hendricks', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'probably', 'best', 'suited', 'entertainment', 'who', 'are', 'looking', 'just', 'small', 'taste', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'fix', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'full-on', 'Sex', 'City', 'Carrie', 'mode']",N/A

Never mind the laundry, meals, cleaning, helping with homework and toilet scrubbing all to the background of little children fighting. So lets just leave it at this - staying at home is as much of a job as going off to the office (except there you get to be around adults, dress up, receive accolades for a job well done and take home a paycheck!). Other than that small bit, this wasn't an awful movie. Parts were funny. The male cast made the movie, though Greg Kinnear, after doing such an awesome job in JFK, was woefully underplayed in this film. Pierce Brosnan, distinguished and handsome as ever, can even make bowling look sexy! Kelsey Grammer's bit was so small he might as well have not even shown up for it.

1428977,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004UXUWOW,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT is both the title of this shallow film and a question that needs to be posed to Sarah Jessica Parker: why is she continuing to take on films that are way below her talent? Based on a novel by Allison Pearson adapted for the screen (and transferred from England to the US) by Aline Brosh McKenna and directed by Doug McGrath this tale of a woman who everybody thinks is superwoman but in reality is an insecure career focused tinker in too many lines of living (mom of two young kids whose work results in her depending on a nanny to raise her children, wife of an aspiring husband who must take second place to his wife's career, miscommunicating new hire for an important role in finance, etc).Part of the film's problem is the technique of having the various characters talk to the audience, often without even eye contact, trying to make the whole story hang together.  Sarah Jessica Parker (looking worn out and saggy) is the star of the film as Kate Reddy, Greg Kinnear is her it's-OK-to-be second-rate husband, Christina Hendricks has a bit of sparkle as Kate's omnipresent girlfriend, Olivia Munn is her Harvard trained office gopher, Pierce Brosnan is her important new boss who sort of sees her for what she is, Kelsey Grammer is her usual boss who is accompanied by the office smart mouth Seth Myers.  A lot of fine talent here pretty much wasted on a story so full of clich&eacute;s and standup comedienne routines and physical pratfalls that is sinks under its own weight.

1428981,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004UXUWOW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I have been such a huge fan of Sarah Jessica Parker since before it was fashionable (yes, I'm old enough to have watched Square Pegs in its original airing), but I wonder why she can't seem to pick a movie script lately that has half of the wit and intelligence of HBO's ""Sex and the City."" Even the ""Sex and the City"" movies (especially the second one) lacked the energy and humor of the TV series. ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" is just the latest unfortunate misfire. The well worn premise is so dated and tired, I don't even know where to begin. If you think that women working in the professional arena is a new or novel phenomenon, this movie might be for you with its antiquated ideas and expected punchlines. It has all the modernity of a Doris Day film with its insulting and old-fashioned notions. From the get-go, the movie lets us know that Parker is both a terrific mother and a fantastic career woman. Problem is--the screenplay really never makes the case that either of these points is true. Oh how can a woman possibly juggle a career and family? Apparently a lot of lying is the key--whether to the bake sale committee or to your boss, it's all the same and absolutely adorable!Parker has a seemingly idyllic life with her husband (an underutilized Greg Kinnear) and two kids. She manages to be wildly successful at work even though she embodies every negative cliche about working mothers that you can possibly imagine. She shows up late, always has food stains on her clothes, is in perpetual disarray, and generally just bumbles about. That's okay, she's a mother (with a full time child care worker no less) so it's expected that she would be a harried mess. When she accidentally sends sexually suggestive emails to an important client, it's endearing (when in reality, who would do business with a ""professional"" who can't even manage their personal emails?) Never mind that Parker is completely unconvincing, the film has plenty of others to insult. All of the men at work are dismissive and/or conniving. Again, what decade is this? Women have been a part of the workforce for quite some time now! But the most loathsome portrait of all is saved for stay-at-home moms. They are vindictive and judgmental harridans who occupy their days with selfish pursuits instead of working.Parker relies, as always, on her nervous energy and clumsiness to mine for physical comedy. She's such a hugely talented actress, though, I'd like to see her dig a little deeper for a change. There's no reason why she isn't among the best in her field. Kinnear brings an easy charm to his largely unexplored second fiddle role. And Pierce Brosnan (as the previously mentioned client who works with Parker on a huge project) has a refreshing deadpan that enlivens the scenes that he's in. Even he gets smitten by the lice-ridden Parker. Why not? There are moments in ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" that are amusing, but the film strains for sentimentality as well. If you think that Miss Parker can't have it all, well then you underestimate her pluck. There are a lot of humorous movies that detail the challenges of working women and mothers everywhere (whether in central themes or peripheral plotlines). ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" misses the mark with its sexist and dated viewpoints--and worse, its stale jokes. I liked Kinnear and Brosnan, but the screenplay could use a real dose of tartness and reality.

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[2, 3]","This movie does manage to capture some classic working mom moments and get us to laugh at them, but unfortunately there's far too much outdated, offensive, stereotype-based humor for it to overcome. Sarah Jessica Parker's character works at an investment bank and is in the midst of launching a new career-making investment product, along with company executive Pierce Brosnan. She's married to Greg Kinnear's character, and they have 2 young kids together. She's torn and guilt-ridden, as she has to travel a lot for this gig, and frantically tries to make it all work. Some of the moments ring true - falling asleep instead of having sex with her husband, waking up in the middle of the night making lists of things to do, writing 'bouncy' on her hand to remind herself to order the bouncy house for her daughter's birthday, fearing her daughter's kindergarten teacher's reaction to being late more than major presentations at work.But unfortunately, there are also lots of misses. The men in her work environment are outdated and offensive and not the least bit funny. The stay-at-home moms are ridiculous and even more offensive, and the 'war' portrayed between these two factions (aka the 'mommy wars') - is unnecessary and not funny. There could have been an opportunity here for showing female solidarity a bit, instead of cattiness, but the writers/directors chose not to go that route, and it's too bad. Compounding the problem is that Parker doesn't seem to have much chemistry with either Kinnear or Brosnan. Also, the documentary style 'interviews' with her friends and co-workers didn't seem t make much sense in the context.So overall, this film had potential, but missed. And BTW, for anyone who has read the book (as I have) this is a very loose adaptation of that, doesn't follow the original storyline at all - more like a 'based on' version than a retelling of the book, so keep that in mind.",3,"Some Truthful, Funny Moments, but Lots of Offensive, Steroetype Ones Too",1332028800,"03 18, 2012",2012,1911,"['movie', 'manage', 'capture', 'classic', 'working', 'mom', 'moments', 'get', 'laugh', 'unfortunately', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'outdated', 'offensive', 'stereotype-based', 'humor', 'overcome', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'character', 'investment', 'bank', 'midst', 'launching', 'new', 'career-making', 'investment', 'product', 'company', 'executive', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'married', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'character', 'have', '2', 'young', 'kids', 'together', 'torn', 'guilt-ridden', 'travel', 'lot', 'gig', 'frantically', 'tries', 'make', 'work', 'moments', 'ring', 'true', 'falling', 'asleep', 'instead', 'having', 'sex', 'husband', 'waking', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'making', 'lists', 'things', 'do', 'writing', ""'bouncy"", 'hand', 'remind', 'order', 'bouncy', 'house', 'daughter', 'birthday', 'fearing', 'daughter', 'kindergarten', 'teacher', 'reaction', 'being', 'late', 'more', 'major', 'presentations', 'work.But', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'also', 'lots', 'misses', 'men', 'work', 'environment', 'are', 'outdated', 'offensive', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'funny', 'stay-at-home', 'moms', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'more', 'offensive', ""'war"", 'portrayed', 'two', 'factions', ""'mommy"", 'wars', 'unnecessary', 'not', 'funny', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'opportunity', 'here', 'showing', 'female', 'solidarity', 'bit', 'instead', 'cattiness', 'writers/directors', 'chose', 'not', 'go', 'route', 'too', 'bad', 'Compounding', 'problem', 'Parker', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'much', 'chemistry', 'Kinnear', 'Brosnan', 'Also', 'documentary', 'style', ""'interviews"", 'friends', 'co-workers', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 't', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'context.So', 'overall', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'missed', 'BTW', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'have', 'very', 'loose', 'adaptation', ""n't"", 'follow', 'original', 'storyline', 'more', ""'based"", 'version', 'retelling', 'book', 'so', 'keep', 'mind']",N/A

1428986,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B004UXUWOW,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","Sarah Jessica Parker is an actress that most folks either love or hate. Some think she's adorable and others think she has horse like features.  Some think she's a tremendous talent while others think she's a hack. For me I think she fits somewhere in the middle. She may not always pick the best movies to make but she does her best and excels at romantic comedy. This brings us to I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT.Parker stars as Kate Reddy, a financial consultant trying to make her way to the top. But she's more than that. She's also the mother of two adorable children. And she's married to Richard (Greg Kinnear), a husband who adores her and supports her career all while having his own as an architect. Kate also does her best to make herself a part of her kid's lives via PTA, etc. And all the mom's just can't get how she can do it all and have it all. But things aren't as great as they seem.Trying to juggle each and every aspect of her life Kate seems on the surface to be handling things perfectly. But behind the scenes things are about to implode. She's just been given the go ahead to promote a project to Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) in New York and has to spend more time on the road. She's beginning to get her schedules mixed up as well as just who she's sending email to and planned holiday time just doesn't seem to work out.But Kate tries her best. Along for the ride are her close friend who's amazed at her capabilities (Christina Hendricks), an assistant who's cool demeanor hides a dazzling brain and loyalty (Olivia Munn) and a boss who appreciates her skill more than anything else (Kelsey Grammer). Each affects her life but not nearly as much as Jack and her family. While Kate and Jack work together, they seem to becoming closer than she might like. And the business side of her life is taking over the private side and hurting things at home. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a tear jerker with tawdry items happening but a light hearted comedy.Parker does a great job here as Kate, the bedraggled mother who wants it all and is doing her best to have it. She shows the competent Kate in the office but balances her out with the frazzled Kate trying to make sure her contribution to the bake sale is perfect for her daughter. She does it all with ease.The supporting cast does a great job as well. Kinnear plays the happy husband who thinks his wife has it all under control but begins to worry when her job takes over her life. Brosnan is the always cool businessman who finds Kate charming. Both men in her life take up most of her time but in the end we know where Kate is going.Many will probably say that this film offers far too much fluff and not enough heavy handed drama. So what? There are times when fluff is a good thing. Sit back and enjoy it now and then and stop thinking movies have to be filled with bad things to be good.I've never been a big Sarah Jessica Parker fan but have always found she's been a good actress in most roles. She shines here. Fans will adore her no matter what.

The reason is apparently because the store is out of baking supplies, not because she can't cook. However she travels a lot and doesn't really have the time to be as domestic as a stay-at-home mom. You have to applaud her for trying to make her kids feel nurtured. I laughed a lot while watching this movie and felt the characters made good choices that benefited their family.

1428997,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B004UXUWOW,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[8, 10]","The movie irritated me with the over abundance of first person narration and asides. It appears this was written as a play and no knew how to adapt it to the screen. Character is not built for you, but is read to you. It is easy to figure out ""how she does it:""1) Super mom has better organizing skills than most people.2) SJP has no trouble lying.3) She takes short cuts.4) SJP totes half of the world's possessions in her bag.5) She has both an educated nanny and husband who support her.That is how she does it.Everyone in the movie will look into the camera and say ""I don't know how she does it."" SJP's character's name is ""Kate REDDY."" Get it? Her arch rival among the other mommies is Wendy BEST. These authors could write porno with imaginative names like that. We could name the husband ""Richard Reddy"" wink wink nudge nudge. Oh, they did!Sarah is struggling to keep up with everything when her job requires her to travel from a Hollywood version of Boston (one where no one has an accent) to NYC even though they have wide screen teleconferencing. Her idea is to develop a retirement account for seniors built upon foreign high dividend paying stocks.I wasn't able to laugh at this comedy. I found out that if a woman signs her e-mail ""XO"" that means ""I want you to enter me"" or for a guy, just the reverse. There are also the typical family disappoints due to work.This is a ""chick flick"" for a married woman...the one that doesn't cheat on her husband with James Bond when she has the opportunity. Perhaps high octane working moms might enjoy this film as they are shown as incredible super heroes who strive for the heart warming ending. The asides of Christina Hendricks toward the end of the film deal with the stereotypes of women in the workplace in an attempt to give the movie meaning. I was only mildly entertained.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Mild swearing.

Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off as predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) comes across as a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate has an up-market jobs, a lot of the problems she faces are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, boss calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleagues and the like.Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film tries to mock stay-at-home mothers; as if stereotyping stay-at-home mothers will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, as Kate deals with a flirtatious but supportive superior.You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate finds herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other characters are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it was only ever meant to be comical.",3,I don't see how it's that bad,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1312,"['movie', 'got', 'SMACKED', 'TO', 'THE', 'HILT', 'critics', 'usually', 'sign', 'movie', 'good.In', 'fact', 'not', ""'amazing"", 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'bad', 'way', 'measurement', 'Of-course', 'flim', ""'deals"", 'stereotype', 'working', 'mothers', 'write', 'off', 'predictable', 'feminism', 'character', 'Kate', 'Reddy', 'played', 'Sarah', 'know', 'who', 'across', 'genuine', 'nice', 'person', 'Even', 'Kate', 'up-market', 'jobs', 'lot', 'problems', 'are', 'universal', 'lack', 'time', 'spend', 'kids', 'calling', 'work', 'when', 'thought', 'had', 'special', 'night', 'partner', 'jealous', 'colleagues', 'like.Unfortunately', 'friend', 'Allison', 'trotted', 'give', 'hard-line', 'men-hate-us', 'mantra', 'now', 'then', 'film', 'tries', 'mock', 'stay-at-home', 'mothers', 'stereotyping', 'stay-at-home', 'mothers', 'will', ""'break"", 'working-mother', 'stereotype', 'recover', 'good', 'interplay', 'SJP', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Kate', 'deals', 'flirtatious', 'supportive', 'superior.You', 'leave', 'movie', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'situation', 'Kate', 'plight', 'modern', 'working', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'rushing', 'life', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'bit', 'one-dimensional', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'demeaning', 'was', 'only', 'ever', 'meant', 'be', 'comical']",N/A

Kate Reddy (Parker) has two young kids, a loving husband and a job she loves. The only problem is the job offered her a promotion and that means more travel and strain on her family. I have to start this by saying that being a guy this is not my kind of movie at all. The best way to describe it is that this is a movie about Carrie Bradshaw with a family and a different job. Even the part where she has voice overs and talks to the camera a few times is in this. While this movie does show a woman in the role usually played by the man in movies (which is a good idea) this is still very boring and repetitive. There are a few funny parts in this, but again the movie is not made for me. Fans of chick-flicks and ""Sex and the City"" will probably love this. I did not. Overall, a movie that was too much of a chick-flick for me to get into. I give it a B-",2,"A very, very big chick-flick that was hard for me to get into. Think a real life Carrie from SITC.

1429001,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B004UXUWOW,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 1]","""I Don't Know How She Does It"" follows the life of Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) working for a financial management in Boston. She is mother of two children, and wife to architect Richard (Greg Kinnear), currently unemployed. Always hard working, Kate juggles multiple tasks at home and at office. Balancing family and career can be difficult, especially when Jack (Pierce Brosnan), a New York business associate, offers you a great chance to further her career.Based on a book written by Allison Pearson, the film's screenplay is by Aline Brosh McKenna, known for ""27 Dresses,"" ""Morning Glory"" and of course, ""The Devil Wears Prada."" So far ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" is the most disappointing work penned by her.To me the film's problem is simple. It doesn't have its own voice. The story looks like a rehash of other better romantic comedies. The characters, likeable as they are, do not have any distinct personality. This is not to say ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" is a total waste of celluloid. It is pretty amusing watching the interactions between Kate and Momo (Olivia Munn), Kate's competent assistant (who, unlike Kate, doesn't like kids).No, it is just that everything is weak and tepid in ""I Don't Know How She Does It."" The weakness is perhaps because of the performances from the leads, or the mocumentary style that director Douglas McGrath (""Nicholas Nickleby"" starring Charlie Hunnam, ""Infamous"") overuses. Or maybe simply because of the lack of real challenges these characters must face. Whatever the reason is, the film just fails to leave a lasting impact on viewers, as a comedy or a drama.",2,"Not Terrible, Just Weak",1341273600,"07 3, 2012",2012,1623,"['Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'life', 'Kate', 'Reddy', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'working', 'financial', 'management', 'Boston', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'wife', 'architect', 'Richard', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'currently', 'unemployed', 'Always', 'hard', 'working', 'Kate', 'multiple', 'tasks', 'home', 'office', 'Balancing', 'family', 'career', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'especially', 'when', 'Jack', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'New', 'York', 'business', 'associate', 'great', 'chance', 'further', 'career.Based', 'book', 'written', 'Allison', 'Pearson', 'film', 'screenplay', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'known', '27', 'Dresses', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'course', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'So', 'far', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'most', 'disappointing', 'work', 'penned', 'her.To', 'film', 'problem', 'simple', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'voice', 'story', 'rehash', 'other', 'better', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'characters', 'likeable', 'are', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'distinct', 'personality', 'not', 'say', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'total', 'waste', 'celluloid', 'pretty', 'amusing', 'watching', 'interactions', 'Kate', 'Momo', 'Olivia', 'Munn', 'Kate', 'competent', 'assistant', 'who', 'Kate', ""n't"", 'like', 'kids', '.No', 'just', 'everything', 'weak', 'tepid', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Know', 'How', 'weakness', 'perhaps', 'performances', 'leads', 'mocumentary', 'style', 'director', 'Douglas', 'McGrath', 'Nicholas', 'Nickleby', 'starring', 'Charlie', 'Hunnam', 'Infamous', 'maybe', 'simply', 'lack', 'real', 'challenges', 'characters', 'must', 'face', 'reason', 'film', 'just', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impact', 'viewers', 'comedy', 'drama']",N/A
