Anyway, it seems like it could have been used in a certain way that would make the movie OK, but everything in this film falls flat.

Some of the video game effects are sorta creepy, but it barely keeps the movie ""alive"", and even the scares aren't scary. I mean, the countess at the end was creepy, and that was basically the only scary thing in the film. I did not like the one-dimensional characters in this film, either.

84720,A29X0YEL6O4KZI,0788869973,"Andrew J. Dobrow ""Career Writer""","[27, 50]","The depth to how bad movies can really be continues to surprise me. I prefer such gems as Spiceworld and Gigli to the film in question, Stay Alive. If that dosn't tell you how poor this movie stands on my suck-ability scale, then the rest of the review will lead you into a clearer spot. I could end the review right now by just saying how much I hated it, but what's the fun in that?Stay Alive tells the story of a group of friends that enjoy playing video games together. Simple enough. But then the dialog starts, and the movie starts going down hill. The jest of the movie is simple. Everyone that dies in the game is dieing in reality in the same way that they died in the game. Sure...they could of just stopped playing, but then the game would of magically played by itself...or something obnoxious like that. To be brutally honest, half way into the movie I wanted to kill the kids myself and heartily and every time the ghost from the game whacked one of them off (ewww), I let out a uproarious yell of joy.I can't point out who was the best actor because they all were bottom feeders. But there is no question in my mind who the worst was. Samaire Armstrong, who had previously been primarily a TV spot actress, is so unbelievably annoying in this movie that I wanted to rip her Ashlee Simpson-esque hair style out of her head. I am not a violent man, but there is no way that she could have been any MORE unconvincing. Either she is pure eye candy for the movie, or someone in the casting department got something he couldn't refuse. Frankie Muniz, known best as Malcolm in the Middle, plays the type of nerd character that every one hates in real life, including other nerds. He always is using huge words and abstract theories to express himself even though everything he says can be simplified. He comes off as a pompous dick who thinks he knows it all. As does most of the other characters.And I have another question. When did gamer chicks become so hot? The film is so out of reach from anything that can relate to reality, that I can't even bring myself to laugh at it. On second thought...HA HA HA! The script tries so hard to be trendy and fails so miserably. If Bell wanted to make a realistic movie involving gamers, he could of at least of done some research of how they interact together. A lot of the game screen shots don't make any sense either, such as when they are playing a multiplayer game, yet it still slides back and forth between MMRPG and first person shooter views. There is no first person in multiplayer. I don't even know what this director was thinking! Another high point of hilarity in this film is the ghost herself. She looks like the child of Marie Antoinette and Bat Boy from the National Enquirer. She is so unscarry looking and unssuming that it;s hard to believe this movie is supposed to be a horror film.I added an extra .5 to the score, part out of sympathy and part from the unintentional laughs it gave me, mostly due to the horrible acting. I recommend you NOT to see this movie because even though I saw it free, I feel robbed. There is no justice when dealing with a film like this. Stay Alive has Razzie Award written all over it, but may even be to bad for that.1 OUT OF 5",1,Hardly Alive,1146528000,"05 2, 2006",2006,3233,"['depth', 'how', 'bad', 'movies', 'can', 'really', 'be', 'surprise', 'prefer', 'such', 'gems', 'Spiceworld', 'Gigli', 'film', 'question', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'dos', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'poor', 'movie', 'suck-ability', 'scale', 'then', 'rest', 'review', 'will', 'lead', 'clearer', 'spot', 'could', 'end', 'review', 'right', 'now', 'just', 'saying', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'what', 'fun', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'enjoy', 'playing', 'video', 'games', 'together', 'Simple', 'enough', 'then', 'dialog', 'movie', 'going', 'down', 'hill', 'jest', 'movie', 'simple', 'Everyone', 'game', 'dieing', 'reality', 'same', 'way', 'died', 'game', 'Sure', 'could', 'just', 'stopped', 'playing', 'then', 'game', 'would', 'magically', 'played', 'something', 'obnoxious', 'be', 'brutally', 'honest', 'half', 'way', 'movie', 'wanted', 'kill', 'kids', 'heartily', 'time', 'ghost', 'game', 'whacked', 'one', 'off', 'ewww', 'let', 'out', 'uproarious', 'yell', 'joy.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'who', 'was', 'best', 'actor', 'were', 'bottom', 'feeders', 'question', 'mind', 'who', 'worst', 'was', 'Samaire', 'Armstrong', 'who', 'had', 'previously', 'been', 'primarily', 'TV', 'spot', 'actress', 'so', 'unbelievably', 'annoying', 'movie', 'wanted', 'rip', 'Ashlee', 'Simpson-esque', 'hair', 'style', 'head', 'am', 'not', 'violent', 'man', 'way', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'MORE', 'unconvincing', 'pure', 'eye', 'candy', 'movie', 'someone', 'casting', 'department', 'got', 'something', 'could', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'known', 'best', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'type', 'nerd', 'character', 'one', 'real', 'life', 'including', 'other', 'nerds', 'always', 'using', 'huge', 'words', 'abstract', 'theories', 'express', 'even', 'everything', 'can', 'be', 'simplified', 'off', 'pompous', 'dick', 'who', 'most', 'other', 'characters.And', 'have', 'question', 'When', 'did', 'gamer', 'chicks', 'become', 'so', 'hot', 'film', 'so', 'reach', 'anything', 'can', 'relate', 'reality', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'bring', 'laugh', 'second', 'thought', 'HA', 'HA', 'HA', 'script', 'so', 'hard', 'be', 'trendy', 'so', 'miserably', 'Bell', 'wanted', 'make', 'realistic', 'movie', 'involving', 'gamers', 'could', 'least', 'done', 'research', 'how', 'interact', 'together', 'lot', 'game', 'screen', 'shots', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'either', 'such', 'when', 'are', 'playing', 'multiplayer', 'game', 'still', 'back', 'forth', 'MMRPG', 'first', 'person', 'shooter', 'views', 'first', 'person', 'multiplayer', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'thinking', 'high', 'point', 'hilarity', 'film', 'ghost', 'child', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'Bat', 'Boy', 'National', 'Enquirer', 'so', 'unscarry', 'looking', 'unssuming', 's', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'horror', 'film.I', 'added', 'extra', '.5', 'score', 'part', 'sympathy', 'part', 'unintentional', 'gave', 'mostly', 'due', 'horrible', 'acting', 'recommend', 'NOT', 'see', 'movie', 'even', 'saw', 'free', 'feel', 'robbed', 'justice', 'when', 'dealing', 'film', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'Razzie', 'Award', 'written', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'bad', 'that.1', 'OUT', '5']",N/A

No dramatic or interesting build-up even leading to it- he just dies.All the deaths in the movie are pretty much the same inexcusable way.

It wasn't. People would die in the video game, and then moments later they'd die in reality. Executed extremely poorly.Come on, a guy leaves his car, and suddenly a magical horse and buggy appears and runs him over? Bad writing.When will movie writers stop making films such as this one?

I did not find it necessary to fast forward through it at any point as the movie kept me fully involved and didn't bog down in a lot of talk. As a gamer I thought that it was a scary concept to say the least. Other than Frankie Muniz and Alice Krige the cast is largely unknown. I would like to see Sophia Bush, who played October, in something else. She handled her role well, and was cute also. That's not to take anything away from Samaire Armstrong, who played Abigail. Also Alice Krige looked really good as well, although her part in this was relatively small. This movie is definately creepy and, I thought, well plotted. On this case itmentions sex/nudity, well, it is almost nonexistant. There is a fair amount of blood and such. I would recommend this for anyone is looking for a good ride, as I think you will not be disappointed. The game of the title sorta reminded me of Silent Hill in its premise and as you gamers know they turned that into a movie of the same name. I haven't played the game or seen the movie.....yet.

84736,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,0788869973,Chris Kennison,"[16, 24]","First of all, I didn't have too high of hopes for STAY ALIVE going in. I had heard numerous negative reviews and I can't stand the ARROGANT and works more than he deserves to FRANKIE MUNIZ. By the way, Frankie must have the greatest agent of all time. Not only does he keep working, but he manages to get a pivotal part in this movie when he should have been one of the death scenes.STAY ALIVE actually has a pretty fun premise. Ridiculous. Yes. A ripoff of THE RING. A little bit. Yet, if you can manage to remember that your watching a movie and can forget reality for a couple of hours, STAY ALIVE actually is pretty fun and actually has a really effective and scary edge to it. In fact, the whole story of Countess Elizabeth Bathory (Maria Kalinina) is very intriguing, disturbing and a tremendous idea to build a scary movie around. The moments when she appears, or just stands in a corner in her bright red victorian dress are frightening.The movie centers around an underground video game that seems to reach beyond the PS2 console and effect real life. A ghost story bottled into a video game disc.So, where does STAY ALIVE go wrong? Many places... and that's the problem. They took this incredible premise of a women who thinks the blood of young girls can keep her young, and wasted it. That to me is the biggest problem. They wasted a FANTASTIC chance to do something cool and unique, and instead did what all scary movies do... wasted time explaining and showing the unknowing characters trying to get each other to believing each other and much worse, getting the authorities to believe them.Instead, they should have spent more time INSIDE THE GAME!! They should have abandoned the real life encounters and delved into a COOL WORLDish situation. They should have teamed up with the animators of the FINAL FANTASY MOVIES and did something cool, and more importantly, something unforgettable.The story behind the game was enough to suffice. It was the coolest part of the movie, but 30 minutes in, the characters strapped into their headsets, grabbed their controllers, played for 3 minutes and quit.This is where the movie, to me, didn't stay alive. It died. It lost its edge and got boring. Up to the point when they got into the game, I was glued. I liked it, despite goofball Frankie Muniz sitting there with his viser on sideways and talking. The moment the movie quit relying on the game to tell the story, the movie died.Finally, sure, I didn't like that Frankie Muniz was in the movie, but the fact that he or his agent managed to talk the directors or writers into giving him this pivotal part at the end of the film and made him seem like the hero of the film seemed like just that... like an agent or himself had used their pull to weasel him into that final scene. Ridiculous and unnecessary. It was enough for me to hate the movie, just the fact that he didn't buy it.This could have been a really good film, but the creators made a lot of ill choices and it should have been better. I took 2 stars away for the lack of video game realiance, and another for Frankie Muniz not dieing.",2,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT... but not without problems,1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,3108,"['First', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'high', 'hopes', 'STAY', 'ALIVE', 'going', 'had', 'heard', 'numerous', 'negative', 'reviews', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'ARROGANT', 'more', 'FRANKIE', 'MUNIZ', 'way', 'Frankie', 'must', 'have', 'greatest', 'agent', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'keep', 'working', 'get', 'pivotal', 'part', 'movie', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'death', 'scenes.STAY', 'ALIVE', 'actually', 'pretty', 'fun', 'premise', 'Ridiculous', 'Yes', 'ripoff', 'THE', 'RING', 'little', 'bit', 'can', 'manage', 'remember', 'watching', 'movie', 'can', 'forget', 'reality', 'couple', 'hours', 'STAY', 'ALIVE', 'actually', 'pretty', 'fun', 'actually', 'really', 'effective', 'scary', 'edge', 'fact', 'whole', 'story', 'Countess', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'Maria', 'Kalinina', 'very', 'intriguing', 'disturbing', 'tremendous', 'idea', 'build', 'scary', 'movie', 'around', 'moments', 'when', 'just', 'stands', 'corner', 'bright', 'red', 'victorian', 'dress', 'are', 'frightening.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'underground', 'video', 'game', 'reach', 'PS2', 'console', 'effect', 'real', 'life', 'ghost', 'story', 'bottled', 'video', 'game', 'disc.So', 'where', 'STAY', 'ALIVE', 'go', 'wrong', 'Many', 'places', 'problem', 'took', 'incredible', 'premise', 'women', 'who', 'thinks', 'blood', 'young', 'girls', 'can', 'keep', 'young', 'wasted', 'biggest', 'problem', 'wasted', 'FANTASTIC', 'chance', 'do', 'something', 'cool', 'unique', 'instead', 'did', 'what', 'scary', 'movies', 'do', 'wasted', 'time', 'explaining', 'showing', 'unknowing', 'characters', 'trying', 'get', 'other', 'believing', 'other', 'much', 'worse', 'getting', 'authorities', 'believe', 'them.Instead', 'should', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'THE', 'GAME', 'should', 'have', 'abandoned', 'real', 'life', 'encounters', 'delved', 'COOL', 'WORLDish', 'situation', 'should', 'have', 'teamed', 'up', 'animators', 'FINAL', 'FANTASY', 'MOVIES', 'did', 'something', 'cool', 'more', 'importantly', 'something', 'unforgettable.The', 'story', 'game', 'was', 'enough', 'suffice', 'was', 'coolest', 'part', 'movie', '30', 'minutes', 'characters', 'strapped', 'headsets', 'grabbed', 'controllers', 'played', '3', 'minutes', 'quit.This', 'where', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'stay', 'alive', 'died', 'lost', 'edge', 'got', 'boring', 'point', 'when', 'got', 'game', 'was', 'glued', 'liked', 'goofball', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'sitting', 'there', 'viser', 'sideways', 'talking', 'moment', 'movie', 'quit', 'relying', 'game', 'tell', 'story', 'movie', 'died.Finally', 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'was', 'movie', 'fact', 'agent', 'managed', 'talk', 'directors', 'writers', 'giving', 'pivotal', 'part', 'end', 'film', 'made', 'seem', 'hero', 'film', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'agent', 'had', 'used', 'pull', 'weasel', 'final', 'scene', 'Ridiculous', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'enough', 'hate', 'movie', 'just', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'it.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'creators', 'made', 'lot', 'ill', 'choices', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'took', '2', 'stars', 'away', 'lack', 'video', 'game', 'realiance', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'not', 'dieing']",N/A
84737,A18G7GG53G2X8A,0788869973,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 1]","If there's one thing horror movies are notorious for, it's turning an everyday moment into a terrifying ordeal. That's probably a big reason why fans of the genre go to see them; only in those kinds of films can you see a normally mundane event become a life or death struggle with monsters, madmen, ghosts, or any combination of the three. I guess it was only a matter of time before someone used the everyday activity of Internet gaming as the basis for a horror movie, and in today's day and age, it couldn't come soon enough. We've already seen stories about haunted houses and hospitals, and there are more than a few films about teenagers who horribly die one by one. Now it's time to throw something new into the mix, a plot device that can be exhaustively used until the new high tech fad comes along.And we now have the end result. It's called ""Stay Alive,"" a twenty-first century fight fest that combines technology with the ghost story and teen slasher genres. Things are quickly set in motion when Loomis Crowley (Milo Ventimiglia) plays a video game, an experimental underground shocker called ""Stay Alive."" It's a brooding, nightmarish role-playing adventure through a haunted plantation. And sure enough, evil reflections, zombies, and ghosts eventually appear, bringing enough startles and shrieks for all. Loomis ultimately loses the game when an especially malevolent force--that has yet to be revealed--murders his video character. But later that night things get seriously twisted. Loomis is himself murdered. And what's worse, his death mirrors the game's death exactly.This is when the rest of the gang is introduced. The film's main character is Hutch MacNeil (Jon Foster), who was apparently Loomis' best friend. His current situation is barely alluded to, but we do know that the man he works for (Adam Goldberg as Miller) is just as obsessed about video games as he is (going as far as to call Hutch into his office--not for a meeting, but for advice on how to win ""Silent Hill 4""). Hutch's past is not that straightforward, either, but one crucial event is hinted at throughout the film, one that attempts to show the connection between him and Loomis as almost brotherly (and no, I won't say what that event was).We also meet Abigail (Samaire Armstrong), the brother and sister duo of October (Sophia Bush) and Phineus Bantum (Jimmi Simpson), and Swink Sylvania (Frankie Muniz, who appears ready to leave behind his years on ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and grow up). They all come together and decide to play ""Stay Alive"" as a sort of salute to their fallen comrade. Pretty soon the weird events begin occurring again; a select few from this circle are killed off in the same way that their video game counterparts die, and a lot of them are pretty brutal.That's when Hutch finally makes the connection, which can be summed up in the film's tagline: ""When you die in the game, you die for real."" But why exactly is this happening? That's the idea foremost in everyone's mind, especially when October says that the game's plotline sounds eerily similar to a story her grandmother had once told her. A few hundred years ago, there lived a noblewoman who was nicknamed The Blood Countess. Apparently, she would capture young girls, torture them, drain them of their blood, and bathe in it in order to preserve her own youth. October also says that the Countess hated mirrors because they reminded her of how old she was getting. (You might be interested to know that this aspect of the film's story was real. Go figure.)And here is the point when all the pieces start falling into place. It soon becomes a quest to stop this ancient serial killer from continuing her postmortem reign of terror. The only way to do that, so the characters of this film say, is to find the location where the game was created. Sure enough, they find it, and that's where the story builds to a satisfying but predictable climax. They still never adequately explain exactly who created the game and why, but I suppose it doesn't really matter; when you're listening to the string-laden score swell to screeching heights and watching grotesque faces pop out of the shadows, you don't really think about anything else.For all its irreverent character portrayals and the use of hopelessly clich&eacute; material, ""Stay Alive"" still manages to be quite entertaining. It's an honest-to-God horror movie in the truest sense, completely loaded with mounting tension, carnival-like pop out scares, and a plot that wouldn't pass muster in any other genre. And that's exactly how it should be. No one thinks to analyze the storyline of a Halloween spook house as they walk through its tight, dark corridors. (This is assuming there is a storyline to begin with.) People just go for the scares, and I think that was the idea behind ""Stay Alive."" I'm guessing that the filmmakers didn't want complexity or meaning: they just wanted to scare the hell out of the audience and have a good time doing it.If this was their goal, then they pretty much succeeded. They certainly knew what audience they were aiming for. What better way to lure in a younger, more in-the-loop crowd than with the idea of Internet gaming running amok? And what better way to reintroduce the classic Ghost Back For Revenge fable than with the modern storytelling of video games? You can tell that some of the characters in this film completely depend on video games for entertainment; never mind seeing a movie or picking up a book. We see that kind of mentality in the stereotyped characters of Phineus and Swink. These are the classic computer geek roles; the former is opinionated and somewhat antisocial while the latter is intellectual and looks as if he'll collapse under the weight of his own ideas.And there are plenty of other stereotype roles, such as the skeptical and completely unhelpful cops that investigate the murders. And let's not forget the host of obligatory bits of dialogue like, ""Hello? Is anyone there?"" (I almost want to scream, ""Of course there is!"" back to the screen when I hear those lines.) It all culminates into a movie that doesn't even try to take itself seriously, even when some genuine tender moments are shared between the characters. That's probably why the film worked for me, and that's probably why it won't work for certain other people; it came off as something made exclusively for horror movie fans (and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that). If classic funhouse scares are what you seek, and if you have a taste for creepy video games, then ""Stay Alive"" is the movie for you.",4,Video Games and Ghost Stories Together: What Will They Think

The video game animation was excellent, the first few scenes established some really good atmosphere, and Stay Alive does offer a slight twist on the typical slasher formula.  And Sophia Bush is in it.The story centers around a group of hard-core gamers (stereotypical one and all, from the ""hero"" to the geek to the goth chick to the hopelessly annoying big-mouth, in addition to a cute young lady who inexplicably joins them) who get all caught up in this new, mysterious game called Stay Alive - the very game one of their fellow gamers was playing the night he and his housemates died grisly deaths.  Those victims physically died in the same way their characters were killed in the game - although Hutch (Jon Foster) and his buds don't know this when they fire the beta test CD up and have a go at the game themselves.  Now, personally, I would have to wonder about a game that only starts when I recite this little chant displayed on the screen without the game having any kind of voice recognition component.  Well, these guys and gals start playing the game and - you guessed it - one of them dies the same way he died in the game.  Now that's definitely weird, but it could still be coincidence at this point.  With Death #3, though, it's definitely time to start freaking out.  Just stop playing the game, you say?  Ah, if only it were that easy.  The game, you see, seems to still be running on its own in some kind of weird virtual vortex or something.  As if things aren't bad enough, Hutch and his friends are definite subjects of interest for the local cops and have to go on the lamb while they try to figure out a way to - wait for it - Stay Alive.While Countess Erzebet Bathory is never mentioned by name, she is obviously the inspiration for the Blood Countess that lies at the heart of the Stay Alive video game.  You remember Countess Bathory, don't you?  She's the Hungarian Countess who slaughtered scores of young maidens because she thought she could sustain her youth perpetually by bathing in the blood of virgins.  In the context of Stay Alive, the Blood Countess has been transferred to New Orleans and, for reasons the movie doesn't even pretend to explain, she's managed to embed her still-bloodthirsty soul into a video game.  Once the gamers figure all this out, they come to the conclusion that, since reality is reflecting what happens in the game, the game must be reflecting real life as well - as in the big tower where the Countess resides.  In other words, they attempt to find her mortal remains and - well, I'm not sure what the plan was, really.I know the plot sounds pretty stupid - and, frankly, it is pretty stupid, but you can still get a kick out of Stay Alive; you just have to cast logic and realism aside and just have fun with what this movie gives you.  If you can't do that, though, you will undoubtedly hate every single thing about it.",3,"Abandon all logic and reason, ye who watch Stay Alive",1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,3515,"['allusions', 'infamous', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'promising', 'less', 'original', 'premise', 'computer', 'game', 'really', 'life', 'assorted', 'deaths', 'own', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'was', 'movie', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'know', 'people', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'movie', 'one', 'critic', 'Christopher', 'Smith', 'said', 'absurd', 'premise', 'were', 'running', 'scissors', 'down', 'very', 'steep', 'hill', 'certainly', 'true', 'plot', 'basically', 'together', 'imagination', 'alone', 'yes', 'things', 'really', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'end', 'actually', 'sort', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'most', 'part', 'video', 'game', 'animation', 'was', 'excellent', 'first', 'few', 'scenes', 'established', 'really', 'good', 'atmosphere', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'offer', 'slight', 'twist', 'typical', 'slasher', 'formula', 'Sophia', 'Bush', 'it.The', 'story', 'centers', 'group', 'hard-core', 'gamers', 'stereotypical', 'one', 'hero', 'geek', 'goth', 'chick', 'hopelessly', 'annoying', 'big-mouth', 'addition', 'cute', 'young', 'lady', 'who', 'inexplicably', 'who', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'new', 'mysterious', 'game', 'called', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'very', 'game', 'one', 'fellow', 'gamers', 'was', 'playing', 'night', 'housemates', 'died', 'grisly', 'deaths', 'victims', 'physically', 'died', 'same', 'way', 'characters', 'were', 'killed', 'game', 'Hutch', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'buds', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'fire', 'beta', 'test', 'CD', 'up', 'have', 'go', 'game', 'Now', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'wonder', 'game', 'only', 'when', 'recite', 'little', 'chant', 'displayed', 'screen', 'game', 'having', 'kind', 'voice', 'recognition', 'component', 'Well', 'guys', 'gals', 'start', 'playing', 'game', 'guessed', 'one', 'same', 'way', 'died', 'game', 'Now', 'definitely', 'weird', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'coincidence', 'point', 'Death', '3', 'though', 'definitely', 'time', 'start', 'freaking', 'out', 'Just', 'stop', 'playing', 'game', 'say', 'Ah', 'only', 'were', 'easy', 'game', 'see', 'still', 'be', 'running', 'own', 'kind', 'weird', 'virtual', 'vortex', 'something', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Hutch', 'friends', 'are', 'definite', 'subjects', 'interest', 'local', 'cops', 'have', 'go', 'lamb', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'way', 'wait', 'Stay', 'Alive.While', 'Countess', 'Erzebet', 'Bathory', 'never', 'mentioned', 'name', 'obviously', 'inspiration', 'Blood', 'Countess', 'heart', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'video', 'game', 'remember', 'Countess', 'Bathory', 'do', ""n't"", 'Hungarian', 'Countess', 'who', 'slaughtered', 'scores', 'young', 'maidens', 'thought', 'could', 'sustain', 'youth', 'perpetually', 'bathing', 'blood', 'virgins', 'context', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'Blood', 'Countess', 'been', 'transferred', 'New', 'Orleans', 'reasons', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'explain', 'managed', 'embed', 'still-bloodthirsty', 'soul', 'video', 'game', 'Once', 'gamers', 'figure', 'out', 'come', 'conclusion', 'reality', 'reflecting', 'what', 'game', 'game', 'must', 'be', 'reflecting', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'tower', 'where', 'Countess', 'resides', 'other', 'words', 'attempt', 'find', 'mortal', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'plan', 'was', 'really.I', 'know', 'plot', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'frankly', 'pretty', 'stupid', 'can', 'still', 'get', 'kick', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'just', 'have', 'cast', 'logic', 'realism', 'aside', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'what', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'though', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'hate', 'single', 'thing']",N/A

You just broke up with your Chickie of the Week, you can't cook, next week at the office is gonna be Hell, new Boss, new Hellerman project, the roommate just got laid off so it looks like you are going to be financing the next three months of utilities, rent, TiVO, the works.One of those. Now: you *could* be productive this weekend, you Schmo.But in the end---sh*t, the weather's bad, why not lay back, get some rest, pack it in with some Wild Turkey (or JD, if that's your thing) and the latest X-Box slaughterama, and give your synapses a rest, Cochise? Why not? Life is short: you could die at any moment.Indeed.So you pop this little thing called ""Stay Alive"" in the hopper: hey, it's Bootleg! And before you know it, you're drawn into its deep, delicious, sick little St. Vitus dance of antebellum plantations and blood-slurping countesses and those lonely, forlorn groves of cyprus trees, and as you maneuver through crypts and tombs and catacombs, your crazy week and everything else---the rent, the surly landlord, what the h*ll you're doing with your life---starts to fall away.And that's when something shifts. Something moves---fast. Something in the blue-black shadows of the kitchen.But there's no one else in the apartment but you, you know?Well, *was*: now there's you...and It.That is ""Stay Alive"", boiled down to its guts: a bunch of twenty-somethings get ahold of this sick little bootleg video game based on the wild and woolly life and times of Elizabeth Bathory, the 16th-century ""Blood Countess"" who amused herself by bathing the blood of maidens she had slaughtered.I went in expecting nothing more than a reeking turd, and was sufficiently creeped out. H*ll, I'm looking forward to the unrated DVD: ""Stay Alive"" delivered in its forlorn, decayed, worn-down locations, its seedy, crawly, pre-Katrina New Orleans, its solid cast (with the exception of Sophia Bush, whose skanky 'alternative' Goth/slacker chick October---with her cheek-wart/cancer & scabby knees made me nauseous---I could have done without) carries the day and---astonishingly---made me actually care about what sick, nasty fate was about to befall our heroes.And what about little Billy Slaughter (Rex, and man, talk about a great stage name!)---well is it just me, or does he do a middle-aged angst-ridden Mel Gibston just a bit too stunningly?Anyway: this one has buzzing, burping game-consoles, and flitting shadows, and a mounting atmosphere of doom and dread, and competent acting, and with an unrated DVD no doubt plenty of goop and gore---frankly, I'm sold. I played, I died, I rebooted.The glory of ""Stay Alive""---helmed by William Brent Bell, who has some fine horror reflexes---is that it gets right down to the guts of what makes ""Resident Evil"" and ""Silent Hill"" so damned fun: as you dig deeper into the guts of the game, you start looking over your shoulder.

I will also add that this movie is so boring that it took me FIVE viewings before I finished it!Stay Alive (movie) is based on an underground interactive video game.  The movie begins with Loomis Crowley, played by...who cares..., trying out an underground video game--Stay Alive--and he seems pretty impressed.  He then goes upstairs and finds two people doing the nasty (one wearing a pig's head--kinda' reminded me of ""Pigsey"" in ""Manhunt"", but I digress).  He then falls asleep, is awakened by (of course) noises downstairs, and upon investigating...I'm not going to tell you anymore.  YOU watch the movie; BORE yourself to death.The entire synopsis is:  after the opening scene, friends show up to play the game and it becomes a race against time since the players must solve the mystery of the game while trying to ""stay alive.""  The bad thing is:  if you die in the videogame, you die in real life.This review is based on the 100-minute, unrated, director's cut.  The original only lasted 85 minutes.

But if you do not meet this criteria, I am quite certain you will struggle to reach the conclusion.Unlike most contemporary horror, the story-line is fresh and intriguing (the few minute tugs at Verbinski's stylistic-devices do not detract from its originality ... for me). Likewise, the focus remains on the story instead of irrelevant sex-scenes (When are horror-directors going to realize that the fan-base of this genre is not entirely comprised of fourteen-year-old boys?!) (Nota bene: although the film is PG-13, it does open with one very brief, sexually explicit moment ... just wanted to warn parents that it is not family-friendly). The pace is near-perfect: plenty of tension, with few empty moments.The casting is superb. Typically, casting teenagers with a background in television-acting renders a bad ""Sci-Fi Channel movie-of-the-week"" effect. Not the case with ""Stay Alive."" Frankie Muniz is FANTASTIC as a hard-core, ultra-dorky gamer (strangely endearing ... and I'm not a ""Malcolm"" fan), Jimmi Simpson is hysterical as the lascivious-yet-lovable friend (hey, everyone has to have one!), and prepare for one seriously freaky cameo from James Haven (Angelina Jolie's brother).Historically, it is important to note that Countess Bathory really did exist. There are numerous fictional and non-fictional texts about her heinous misdeeds. Of course, you will have to suspend your disbelief when the film reveals that she moved to New Orleans (no such thing, my friend). Nonetheless, kudos to a writer who unearths a historical-figure from seventeenth-century Hungary and positions her as the villain.The conclusion does not disappoint! The last thirty minutes will REALLY delight gamers ... the line becomes blurred between the gaming world and reality (Haven't we all literally dreamed ""Final Fantasy"" after ten hours of game-play?!) And, there is just enough misdirection to keep you guessing until the very end!As a life-long gamer and horror-enthusiast, this film was an unexpected pleasure for me.  No, it does not have tremendous depth: no significant social issues are explored. It is purely entertaining: and that is JUST fine! I hope Bell tackles similar projects in the future ... he will always have an audience with us ""Resident Evil"" playing weirdos! And, ummmm, after seeing this film , I really did by an Alienware (but that mirrored one in the film ... sadly does not exist!) ... so, pretty awesome advertisement (and, hey, it's just a smart buy ...

It was a fun way to spend some time.BUT ...There are so many ""dumb chick"" moments where the female characters do such outrageous stupid things, the audience was cheering for the bad guy.Importing Erzabet Batory - Countess Elizabeth Bathory was cute and all, but New Orleans has it own famous sexual sadistic killers, the LaRues.  And they really made the Blood Countess look angelic.The Cops were bungling keystone characters who I suppose are supposed to be the older adults who don't listen to the smart kids.  That's a classic movie cliche.Pros:1. Graphic/Effects were awesome and domake you want to buy the game that is sure to be released soon2. The acting wasn't all bad and it was nice to see Fankie Muniz play a hero.3. The smart kids, not the hot guy or the strong guy are the heroes4. It was nice to see that the  Desteran Plantation survived Katrina.5. It was nice to see the cemetery where Marie Laveua is buried is still in good shaped post-hurricaneCons1. A script that should be burned2. We should have met the game designer3. Dumb White Chick moments4. No people of color except for the secretary at the law firm and the older cop.  New Orleans is a town of many cultures and it should have been treated as such and we should have seen that flavor.5. Historical/Grammatical inaccuracy that made my teeth hurt.  Malleaus Maleforcorium is the Witches Hammer or the Hammer Against Witches, Malleus Demonium means Hammer against Demons.  Two totally separate things.  Witches aren't demons and it is insulting to say that.  Upward of saying that Jew Control The Banks.  Elizabeth Bathory was a 15th century Hungarian Noble Woman with red hair, she bathed in theblood of virgins to stay young and killed 650 girls.

84750,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,0788869973,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 1]","The legendary Elizabeth B&aacute;thory, a countess in Romania was notorious for bathing in the blood of young girls... and then she went to Louisiana, was walled up in a New Orleans plantation and somehow haunted a video game.What, you don't remember that part? Neither do I.And that rape of history is only one of many problems that plague ""Stay Alive,"" which is yet another movie that tries -- and fails -- to be ""The Ring."" This time, it's a survival horror video game that will immediately kill you if you die in the game... except that sometimes it will kill you even if you don't. Either way, it's a tedious slog that never really manages to be scary.After a beta-tester dies, his little sister gives his video games to his old buddy Hutch (Jon Foster). The one he was playing before his death is an unreleased game called ""Stay Alive,"" set in a weird boarding school where you must avoid being killed by Elizabeth Bathory. So Jon gets together with his friends, plus a Manic Pixie Dream Girl he met at the funeral (Samaire Armstrong) and a buddy who is playing remotely from his office.But when that guy dies in the same way he died in the video game, Hutch and Co. begin to suspect that something more is afoot with the video game -- and that somehow, Elizabeth Bathory has cursed everyone who plays the game. How? I don't know. As they search for a way to defeat her, the various players must ""stay alive"" in the game -- or they'll die for real.One of the most persistently annoying parts of ""Stay Alive"" is the legend of Elizabeth Bathory... which departs dramatically from her actual history. To my knowledge, she never visited the Americas, never lived in New Orleans, and she died under very different circumstances from the ones described in the movie. They should have just BASED the ""blood countess"" on her life, rather than using the actual historical figure.But even if they had, it wouldn't have made ""Stay Alive"" a good movie -- just a slightly less irritating one. This is yet another movie that blatantly rips off ""The Ring,"" presenting us with cursed technology that will kill you if you interact with it.And sadly, it's boring. Really boring. Except for brief glimpses of bloodslicked corpses and messy deaths, the movie mostly drifts along with lots of ponderous discussions about the friggin' obvious Cursed Video Game O' Death, as well as a tepid love triangle that never really amounts to anything. The most exciting part of the movie is actually the video game itself, which is very well-made and atmospheric.By the time the horrific stuff with Bathory really comes into play, the movie is almost over. And by then, viewers will probably be frustrated by the fact that the video game keeps violating its own rules, by killing people who haven't died yet in the game. That's the worst thing a horror movie can do.And the actors show the same lack of enthusiasm (or talent). I have to give Frankie Muniz credit -- his quirky, chattering Swink is perhaps the most likable character of the movie. Most of the rest either play one-note characters (Jimmi Simpson as the sneering stoner) or give one-note performances (Samaire Armstrong, Jon Foster). And it has a virtually useless cameo by Alice Krige, giving us one of the worst Cajun accents I have ever heard.With a legendary ""vampire"" and another ripoff of ""The Ring,"" ""Stay Alive"" sounds like it should be at least SLIGHTLY interesting.

84757,A1ZRO681DK4NC4,0788869973,HorrorFilms101,"[0, 0]","What can I say, I'm a fan of horror movies, and video games (specifically survival horror games), so when they mixed these two together, I was stoked to say the least. But how do I feel after actually watching the film?Not too bad. I've seen worse and I've seen better, which basically sticks this film right smack in the middle. Sure the plot is simple enough; ""die in the game, die in real life,"" but they did things with the plot that actually seemed to hold the movie together. Though, it seems that they used scotch tape instead of an industrial adhesive. Yet, for me, it was still a relatively thrilling ride.So what elements came together to make this so?Plot- Plot holes? Ok, maybe a few, but the major pits are explained. If you were too hopped up to get it, then let me explain. Once you say the prayer at the beginning of the game, you're in. So, ""just stop playing the game"" is not an option. The spirit world will continue your game journey for you. Once you say that prayer, you've just opened the gateway between you and the game. Now the spirits just needs a gateway from the game to you.  Just remember what's (or who's) at the basis of the paranormal aspects of the plot. And that's really the only plot hole that I can think of, but I didn't analyze it too harshly, being a horror film in general....what films don't have some?Element of Fear- Unfortunately the movie relied heavily on the clich&eacute;d abrupt smash cuts and piercing volume commands, yet they seemed to pull it off in a few areas which left me with a few good scares after it was all said and done. This type of ""scare tactic"" has become a mainstay in most mainstream horror films (hey, it does work!). Flashing freaky images and blood everywhere seems to just put people in the mood, because there are only so many ways to scare someone, and when you get right down to it 99% of the time it has to do with death.The Group- I think that the gamer group in this film really held together well. Though the characters are pretty one-dimensional, they are set up with certain character traits that hold together throughout the duration of the film. Obviously some of the characters go through changes, and although they seem to get through their mourning stages quickly, I think that they kept a thrilling pace. I thought that the group was realistically staged, and they were held together by more than just games, they were friends too.Mix of 3D and Real Life- Despite the inconsistencies in the ""game world,"" which was obviously not researched very well, the gaming aspect was definitely short lived and underused. In technical terms, the game switches views all too often, and was shot more like a film, rather than an actual game. However, I'm sure that this was done on purpose simply to make it work, and I suppose to those who aren't avid gamers, they'll see no visual disturbances. With the link between the game and the real world, this gave the plot a much better, more intricate, stage to play off of.Gore- The gore worked well for me. I think that in some places it could've been enhanced, and some places needed some work, at times I feel like the gore in the game did more justice than the live effects. But for the most part, it was clever, used well and at the right time, and I think it was fitting for the type of story.Acting- At far as I'm concerned, the actors responded well to the issues at hand. It wasn't a clich&eacute;d movie from this standpoint. In fact, I'd give it 5 stars just for being based on realism. The main character is on a quest, and that's where I'd be as well. They don't run to the hardware store and grab some guns to shoot the ghosts; they actually try to solve the puzzle. The deaths, therefore, are realistic acts as well, and not a fault (in some part) of the actors stupidity.Obviously with a film budgeted like this, you're going to get some decent acting, audio, and music elements. I found everything to be fitting and it seemed to fit where and when needed. I guess what I judged the movie on mostly was the flow of the plot and its originality.I do see the relation to the Japanese horror films, but that's a mainstay now, and people are going to have to accept it. Face it, it's freaky, and that's what you want in a film like this. Anything else, just wouldn't be the same. Obviously they got some inspiration from these films, but I don't think that anything was stolen. They definitely added their own twist to the mix and that's always exciting to see.Overall- What can I say, I simply enjoyed it enough to watch it again. I probably wouldn't buy the DVD, but I would rent it again on a cold, foggy Halloween day....",3,A gamer's point of view....,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,4661,"['What', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'fan', 'horror', 'movies', 'video', 'games', 'specifically', 'survival', 'horror', 'games', 'so', 'when', 'mixed', 'two', 'together', 'was', 'stoked', 'say', 'least', 'how', 'do', 'feel', 'actually', 'watching', 'film', 'Not', 'too', 'bad', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'worse', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'basically', 'film', 'right', 'smack', 'middle', 'Sure', 'plot', 'simple', 'enough', 'die', 'game', 'die', 'real', 'life', 'did', 'things', 'plot', 'actually', 'seemed', 'hold', 'movie', 'together', 'used', 'scotch', 'tape', 'instead', 'industrial', 'adhesive', 'was', 'still', 'relatively', 'thrilling', 'ride.So', 'what', 'elements', 'came', 'together', 'make', 'so', 'Plot-', 'Plot', 'holes', 'Ok', 'maybe', 'few', 'major', 'pits', 'are', 'explained', 'were', 'too', 'hopped', 'up', 'get', 'then', 'let', 'explain', 'say', 'prayer', 'beginning', 'game', ""'re"", 'So', 'just', 'stop', 'playing', 'game', 'not', 'option', 'spirit', 'world', 'will', 'continue', 'game', 'journey', 'say', 'prayer', ""'ve"", 'just', 'opened', 'gateway', 'game', 'Now', 'spirits', 'just', 'gateway', 'game', 'Just', 'remember', 'what', 'who', 'basis', 'paranormal', 'aspects', 'plot', 'really', 'only', 'plot', 'hole', 'can', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'analyze', 'too', 'harshly', 'being', 'horror', 'film', 'general', '.what', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Element', 'Fear-', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'relied', 'heavily', 'clich', 'eacute', 'abrupt', 'smash', 'cuts', 'piercing', 'volume', 'commands', 'yet', 'seemed', 'pull', 'off', 'few', 'areas', 'left', 'few', 'good', 'scares', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'type', 'scare', 'tactic', 'become', 'mainstay', 'most', 'mainstream', 'horror', 'films', 'hey', 'work', 'Flashing', 'freaky', 'images', 'blood', 'everywhere', 'just', 'put', 'people', 'mood', 'are', 'only', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'scare', 'someone', 'when', 'get', 'right', 'down', '99', '%', 'time', 'do', 'death.The', 'Group-', 'think', 'gamer', 'group', 'film', 'really', 'held', 'together', 'well', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'one-dimensional', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'certain', 'character', 'traits', 'hold', 'together', 'duration', 'film', 'Obviously', 'characters', 'go', 'changes', 'seem', 'get', 'mourning', 'stages', 'quickly', 'think', 'kept', 'thrilling', 'pace', 'thought', 'group', 'was', 'realistically', 'staged', 'were', 'held', 'together', 'more', 'just', 'games', 'were', 'friends', 'too.Mix', '3D', 'Real', 'Life-', 'inconsistencies', 'game', 'world', 'was', 'obviously', 'not', 'researched', 'very', 'well', 'gaming', 'aspect', 'was', 'definitely', 'short', 'lived', 'underused', 'technical', 'terms', 'game', 'views', 'too', 'often', 'was', 'shot', 'more', 'film', 'rather', 'actual', 'game', 'However', ""'m"", 'sure', 'was', 'done', 'purpose', 'simply', 'make', 'work', 'suppose', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'avid', 'gamers', ""'ll"", 'see', 'visual', 'disturbances', 'link', 'game', 'real', 'world', 'gave', 'plot', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'intricate', 'stage', 'play', 'off', 'of.Gore-', 'gore', 'worked', 'well', 'think', 'places', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'enhanced', 'places', 'needed', 'work', 'times', 'feel', 'gore', 'game', 'did', 'more', 'justice', 'live', 'effects', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'clever', 'used', 'well', 'right', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'fitting', 'type', 'story.Acting-', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'actors', 'responded', 'well', 'issues', 'hand', 'was', ""n't"", 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'movie', 'standpoint', 'fact', ""'d"", 'give', '5', 'stars', 'just', 'being', 'based', 'realism', 'main', 'character', 'quest', 'where', ""'d"", 'be', 'as', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'hardware', 'store', 'grab', 'guns', 'shoot', 'ghosts', 'actually', 'try', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'deaths', 'therefore', 'are', 'realistic', 'acts', 'as', 'well', 'not', 'fault', 'part', 'actors', 'stupidity.Obviously', 'film', 'budgeted', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'decent', 'acting', 'audio', 'music', 'elements', 'found', 'everything', 'be', 'fitting', 'seemed', 'fit', 'where', 'when', 'needed', 'guess', 'what', 'judged', 'movie', 'mostly', 'was', 'flow', 'plot', 'originality.I', 'do', 'see', 'relation', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'mainstay', 'now', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'accept', 'Face', 'freaky', 'what', 'want', 'film', 'Anything', 'else', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'Obviously', 'got', 'inspiration', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anything', 'was', 'stolen', 'definitely', 'added', 'own', 'twist', 'mix', 'always', 'exciting', 'see.Overall-', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'would', 'rent', 'again', 'cold', 'foggy', 'Halloween', 'day']",N/A
84758,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,0788869973,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[1, 2]","""Stay Alive"" is a movie about a video game called ""Stay Alive"".  Beware of the evil video game!!!  The premise behind this movie is that once your character dies in the game, you also die in real life.  Scary, huh?  Well, no, not really.  Ostensibly, ""Stay Alive"" comes across as being an original movie, unless one has seen other horror movies, especially recent ones like ""The Ring"".  ""Stay Alive"" certainly borrowed extensively from the far superior movie known as ""The Ring"", and this is not a good thing because it's very difficult to a pull a movie like that off, and ""Stay Alive"" fails miserably in this regard.Unlike ""Stay Alive"", ""The Ring"" had much better actors in it, a much better story of which the viewer can actually buy into, and, even as far-fetched as it was, ""The Ring"" is actually capable of eliciting some horror in the audience along with making some degree of sense, at least by movie's end.  Oh, ""Stay Alive"" is certainly far-fetched and cliche-ridden, but it's also very poorly-acted, generic, poorly executed and does not make any sense as other reviewers have already pointed out.  ""Stay Alive"" requires too much of the viewer in his/her leap of faith with its gaping plot holes which makes for a ridiculously unrealistic movie.  Now the fact that it has bad acting only makes it more apparent that this movie is completely stupid.  It's full of cheap little ""jump-out-at-you"" scares or scare attempts, but the movie is virtually lifeless.  Unfortunately, ""Stay Alive"" offers very little in the way of plot, style and substance as far as its merits as a horror movie are concerned.  Finally, there are NO likeable characters in this movie and no one the viewer/audience can identify with and root for so to speak.  All you have in this movie are a bunch of stupid 20 somethings who would not have enough sense to know to come in out of the rain.While ""Stay Alive"" may be somewhat suspenseful at first, it unfortunately spirals sharply downhill in a hurry as it progresses towards its miserable conclusion.  All and all, it's very difficult for the viewer to take this movie seriously (yeah, it's kind of a joke) at all, and while I might recommend ""Stay Alive"" to the video game-obsessed teeny-bopper, I certainly would not recommend ""Stay Alive"" to any serious horror movie fan.

""A New Yorker""","[1, 1]","So that I wouldn't have to stay awake.""Stay Alive"" is a bland horror movie about a video game that kills people the same way they die inside the game. The friends that play this game soon figure this out, and then realize they must defeat the Blood Countess from the video game or accept their fates.We've had video tapes in ""The Ring,"" a deadly website in ""Fear Dotcom,"" and of course video games movies such as this one. ""Stay Alive"" does some things well; the character development is quite a bit deeper than it usually would be in a horror movie. We really see into some of the characters feelings and past and get to know them all quite well, so the viewers may gain some emotions for them. The film is also very suspenseful. Tense, unnerving moments are frequently played through the film, accompanied by unsettling, creepy music. There are plenty of jumps and jolts for the viewer. This can be ideal once or twice, but these false scares that Hollywood seems to enjoy overplaying in horror films nowadays, wears thin in Stay Alive.The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or quick flashes in order to give viewers a very quick glimpse of a demon or witch, and try to scare them with this sudden burst on the screen. Why? The gore is obviously very weak because of the film's certificate. The script to Stay Alive is very cheesy and quite laughable, and the characters tend to play it too melodramatically and confusingly. Also, clich&eacute;s come in from every direction, for instance people wandering around on their own in search of a strange noise or if they have spotted a figure in the dark, they will go and investigate it.However the computer graphics used for the video game segments are rather impressive and look colorful and sharp, working well with the other parts of the film. But overall, there is just not enough to hold out on with this film.

Then they discover the game and the nightmare is REAL!!!!!!!Just kidding...A group of New Orleans teenagers begin to play an ultra-realistic next level videogame called, you guessed it...STAY ALIVE, based on the spine-chilling true story of a 17th century noblewoman known as ""The Blood Countess."" they soon discover a spine-chilling connection -- they are each being brutally murdered one-by-one in the same method as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and the real world disappears, the group must find a way to STAY ALIVE.  The film boasts Frankie Muniz, Malcom himself ( as SWINK), Jon Foster (as HUTCH) Samaire Armstrong, Sophia Bush (as ABIGAIL and October), Jimmi Simpson (as PHINEUS), Adam Goldberg (as MILLER). Rated PG-13 - for horror violence, disturbing images, language, brief sexual and drug content typical of Hollywood teen horror fare. This film runs 85 minutes long, and this is long enough. ""Stay Alive"" goes the way of most (21st cen.) films of the genre, since Wes Craven (director of Freddy's Elm St. series) redefined it with self-satire in Scream, which is the build on the slasher-movie mythos by using concepts so familiar to us that the tension stems from our own anticipation and the predictability of the film itself. Stay Alive director William Brent Bell, knows the genre well-enough having worked as production coordinator and assistant director on TV projects ( BUCKETS OF BLOOD and ALIENS FOR BREAKFAST in the 90's) for ROGER CORMAN, the king of the B-Horror flick. This can be okay, as long as you know that is what you are paying for, don't expect a movie milestone here, okay.The ultimate horror will come when the sequel STAYIN' ALIVE comes in which the survivors play an in an ultra-realistic John Travolta dancing film!!!!Just kidding...BIG EASY ALERT!

When Milo stumbles on a video game called Stay Alive, he is driven to hang himself just as his character in the game, and his housemates are found savagely hacked to death.  Jon Foster, his best friend, wonders what could have made Mile commit suicide, for he was always a cheerful boy without a care in the world.  At the funeral he meets the bizarre and annoying Samaire Armstrong, who is photographing all the mourners with an old fashioned camera I thought was going to eventually prove she was evil, or came from another dimension, but I was wrong, wrong, wrong and I don't mind admitting it.  What was the reason for her being a photographer, I wonder.  Some reviewers have said that her camera is a clever visual reference to a previous video game or horror movie in which the heroine sports a similar outmoded box camera.  Wouldn't you think that her camera would wind up solving the mystery?  No, that was not in the version of Screenwriting 101 that these bozos took, or perhaps they only went to the class in which they were told, hire the very worst actors available to you at all times.In fact I used to like Jon Foster, especially in that movie where he was hired by Jeff Bridges essentially to babysit his mentally troubled wife Kim Basinger.  Sexy!  And indeed I used to like Samaire Armstrong on The O.C.  The other actors, Sophia Bush as a goth babe called &Ouml;ctober, the Malcolm in the Middle kid, now grown up and uglier than a crawfish, and whoever the brother was of October who gets run down by a stagecoach, they should all resign from acting.  Adam Goldberg has a bit part in this--just asking for death.  And how did they manage to rig up the plot so there are absolutely no black people in Louisiana I wonder, beyond Bunk from The Wire, who is probably wishing that Paul Chan's avant-garde production of Waiting for Godot on the banks of the broken levee paid a little bit more.  The evil blood countess Elizabeth Bathory is the villain here, the mistress of a pre Civil war plantation at which, looks like, only white girls worked.  What?  White slavery in the old South?

Still, as I recently told a friend, I guess I'll watch anything! You never know what unexpected delights might be awaiting you, even in the unlikeliest of places. Because that's just it! I have hope, hope that I'll be pleasantly surprised. That hope abandoned me as I settled in to view ""Stay Alive."" Let's be honest, this movie is no worse than dozens of other movies that are virtually indistinguishable from it in terms of casting and plotting. Basically, an attractive TV ready ensemble is knocked off one by one. That's the same description for about 5671 other movies as well. My reaction to ""Stay Alive"" becomes apathetic because, while it may be competently made, there are absolutely no original ideas or images presented.The hook of ""Stay Alive"" is intriguing enough. A new videogame unleashes a murderous spell. If you are killed in the game, you will meet a similar gruesome end in the real world. Bummer. So, of course, our young cast all play the game. And they start dropping dead. One would hope, at least, for some creative carnage. But not here, seen it all before. The silliness that ensues include the requisite bumbling police investigation, the burgeoning romance, and the clues that lead to an immense estate (that apparently no one knows about) that resembles the environment in the game. I would say that the graphics in the game are the most visually interesting aspect of ""Stay Alive,"" but this seems rather silly--I'd just play a game if this was what was most important.Listen, I didn't hate this movie. The problem is that it barely registers at all. Jon Foster and Samaire Armstrong are likable and attractive enough. Foster, especially, has potential and talent. He was great in the overlooked ""The Door in the Floor"" with Jeff Bridges and a number of other projects. And Armstrong proved appealing in her TV roles on ""The OC"" and ""Entourage."" I wish them well with future choices.You can watch ""Stay Alive"" if you like these films. You might even find it passable entertainment. But as it blends into the hundreds of similar films, is there anything that will cause you to remember this one fondly? Nothing stood out for me, except maybe that Frankie Muniz (from ""Malcolm in the Middle"") shouldn't wear a visor. But really, no one needs to wear a visor--or should, for that matter! I didn't need to see ""Stay Alive"" to come to that conclusion. Just like everything else in this routine and perfectly ordinary picture, I'd figured everything out that I needed to within 5 minutes.

Stay Alive is a fun horror movie about a demonically possessed video game and a group of gamers who fall prey to it. Stay Alive is actually a video game still in the testing stages which is based (loosely) on the legend of Countess Bathory. However, the gamers soon find that what happens in the video game, happens in the real world as blood begins flying and gamers start dying.The plot is very formulaic, but for the most part, it is executed well. Though you know what will happen next, and who is likely to die next, you still find yourself enjoying the film. Both likeable characters and fun special effects help this flow tremendously. Very stylistic, the movie blends videogame and movie very elegantly, the combination being more enjoyable than Silent Hill, or the second Mortal Kombat. Of course, dental surgery is more enjoyable than the second Mortal Kombat.I was set to give this movie a glowing review and five stars, but unfortunately, like too many horror movies of late, this one falls apart at the end. There are elements that make no sense, and leave the viewer with a pained expression while trying to figure out where THAT came from. A few choice pieces of dialogue could have cleared some of these things up, but others come from far left center and are never explained (I can't list them because they would provide big time spoilers).

""Stay Alive?""  Why, this time it's murderous video games!There's the chance for cultural commentary in all of these stories, but none of them bother to think that hard, ""Stay Alive"" the least of them.  Written and directed by relative newcomer William Brent Bell, the story takes an interesting premise -- if you die in the video game, you die in exactly the same way in real life -- and dumbs it down so much that, at the halfway point, the movie goes from being laughably bad to being insultingly bad.At the start of the film, our centerpiece -- one Mr. Hutch -- discovers that his best childhood chum (along with two roommates) were brutally murdered in their home after playing a bootlegged video game.  At the funeral, Hutch meets a girl who -- apparantly -- gets her kicks by trolling around random funerals and taking intrusive pictures of mourners with a camera the size of a casserole dish.  She introduces herself as Plot Device -- I mean, uh, Abigail -- and proceeds to spend the rest of the movie attached to Hutch's hip.  As far as being a useful and interesting character, she ranks right up there with Jar-Jar Binks or, uh, Bleeding Gums Murphy.  (If you decide to watch this movie, pay careful attention to her.  My favorite part is when she is trapped in an evil torture chamber, and she decides to play ""he loves me, he loves me not"" with a rose that she was given to protect her.)Hutch inherits some of his pal's belongings, including the lethal game, and as a ""tribute"" to his fallen friend, he and five other friends gather together and give the game a go.  Cue: wackiness.I want to be nice and give this film kudos for trying to pull off something that's necessarily complicated (I'm talking about the philosophical implications of video game violence, reset buttons, and multiple lives as they are made manifest in our real-life mentalities), but I'm not entirely sure the movie tried at all.  There are so many things I could point to.  The incompetent police officers who run the investigation on the video game murders (and who attempt to arrest people who obviously could've never been involved in them).  The poorly directed and entirely unsuspenseful death scenes.  The inconsistencies within the game's reality (people who didn't die in the game still kick the bucket in real life, and vice versa).  The half-hearted attempts at acting -- although I guess it would be hard, as an actor, to find the right way to respond to the line, ""An ancient noblewoman who is afraid of mirrors killed your friend with a pair of pruning shears because he wasn't very good at the video game that she programed and produced from beyond the grave.""Just kidding.  That line's not in the movie, but it may as well be.  The characters in the movie figure out fast enough what's going on, but it hardly seems to faze them one bit.  Well, the nebbish Swink seems to realize that what's going on is beyond the norm (he screeches things like, ""This is highly unlikely!"" and ""This is completely contrary to any perceptive reality!""), but his strained fear is only palpable because he is over-acted by a Kermit-voiced and crazy-eyed Frankie Muniz.The final straw for me wasn't the predictable ending, or the kooky story line, or the continuity problems.  It was Hutch.The writers tried to graft some personality onto Hutch by using the Tortured Past Device, in this case, giving Hutch a history with fire that causes him considerable consternation.  This device is slapped into the script without much deftness, banged into place like a giant billboard that reads ""Here Thar Be Foreshadowing!""  Of course, at a climactic moment in the movie, Hutch must face his fear of fire in order to save the day.  I don't fault the script for utilizing this kind of tired premise.  It isn't, after all, unheard of.BUT, Mr. Bell, assuming his audience is full of simpletons, must not have trusted his little narrative device, because he treats the viewer to -- literally -- a dozen jump cuts between the adult Hutch surrounded by fire and the adolescent Hutch surrounded by fire, as if we didn't get what was going on.  It's the cinematic equivalent of saying, ""See?  Get it?  Do ya get it?"" and Mr. Bell does it about twelve times.There's a pretty funny Monty Python skit about that -- ""Knowhattamean?  Knowhattamean?"" -- but this is neither funny nor scary nor revealing nor profound.  It's the final fake lily placed on the grave that this movie digs for itself.  Avoid this film.

Yes, you have seen this movie before:  not necessarily with the same actors or settings, but this is a film that is just cobbled together from better movies.  The result is a bad movie that is little more than a string of horror cliches.The most obvious plot source of this movie is The Ring.  The only difference is that there is a computer game instead of a videotape.  (Of course, The Ring was based on the Japanese film, Ringu, so Stay Alive is really a rip-off of a remake.)  Those who play the game die in the same way they died in the game.  The characters in this movie are little more than one-dimensional themselves:  we have the computer nerd, the stoner, the goth girl and so on.  As is typically the case, you can almost pick the order that the characters will die in and know exactly which two will be around for the inevitable final confrontation.  There's also the disbelieving cop and the strange old lady (who in this case, talks a bit like Elmer Fudd) who knows exactly what's going on.The idea of cleverness on the part of the writers is that the destruction of the evil character can only be accomplished by fire and the hero has a fear of fire.  What original irony!  And this is around as clever as the movie gets.  As is typical in the weaker movies in this genre, the characters are pretty dense, separating when they should stick together and always groping around in the dark rather than hitting light switches.From beginning to end, Stay Alive is almost completely forgettable.

I'm not sure if I should have kept on passing up or not.  Maybe it is worth seeing one time just to see how bad a movie can be.  Cliched does not begin to describe this movie.  There are so many horror movie cliches in this film it's ridiculous.  Terrible acting, stereoptypical characters and not an original idea in the thing.  Well, people die who play a video game you say.  That's original.  You already saw the same scenario in 'The Ring' only it was a video.  And another thing?  How do dead spirits program video games?  Well, that's a question for another time.  Anyway, the guy dying in the truck was the last straw for me.  Where did that come from?  It looked like the director or wirters or producers or someone decided that we had gone too long without a death so they just threw one in to keep the movie moving.  And of course, everybody in the film was familiar with Countess Bathory, who legend has it was nicknamed Countess Dracula.  I wonder if you walked into a high school or college and asked a thousand students who had not seen this film who Countess Bthory was how many could tell you.  Apparently just about every one of them.  Unfortunately, the account of her story as given by the medium or witch or whatever she was in the film is completely inaccurate.  Look it up yourself.  I'm sure many people have.  Perhaps the screenwriters cold have researched her story as well. But if you're going to use legends that are easy to check on, be accurate or if not accurate, don't just throw out body count numbers.  So in the end what we have here is a totally flawed story logically that doesn't follow, a series of scenes that have been done over and over many times in many other movies, bad writing, bad acting, nothing but sterotypes for characters and an ending that you see coming from like 5 minutes into the film when the first cigarette lighter is lit.

Stay Alive follows the same formula of The Ring and many other Americanized versions of great Japanese horror films, and like The Ring and the countless other Americanized remakes, Stay Alive fails miserably.  The film concerns a group of gamers (Jon ""brother of Ben"" Foster, Samaire Armstrong, Sophia Bush, Malcolm in the Middle's Frankie Muniz, and more) drawn to a horror video game that finds when one of them dies in the game, they die the same way in real life.  Yeah, Stay Alive is nothing you haven't seen before or seen better, and the idiotic screenplay is so overloaded with plot holes and leaps of logic that you'll be astonished just how stupid these people are.  Then again, you're not watching Stay Alive for these reasons, you're watching it for scares, and in that department alone, once again the film fails miserably.  Not to mention that even though this is claimed to be the ""director's cut"" of the PG-13 rated film, Stay Alive still feels as if the filmmaker's are holding back.

Normally, the option to play the movie is selected so I had to scroll down to it. I watched the movie, it was horrible. After the movie I went back to the menu to find out what ""characters"" was. I find out you can customize a character, his clothes and weapon. There were even rules to play a game. So I thought the DVD might not be a total waste if it includes a game. Wrong. The object of the game is to select the right character with the right shirt and right weapon. I spent 10min doing this. When I finally got it right, all I got was a different menu screen. What the??? The creators REALLY wanted people to hate this movie didn't they?I would have thought that a movie with such high caliber actors such as Frankie Muniz would at least have decent picture quality. But blurry shots run rapid though this flick. One second the picture is clear, the next blurry, the one after that clear. It's like that through the whole movie.This movie follows every horror movie clich&eacute; with all the ""I saw that coming a mile away"" scenes. There are absolutely no scares. The only thing that keeps this movie from being boring is that it's so ridiculous. In the movie the guy who created the killer game said that the way to scare people is to add realism to the story. I agree. So why is this movie so lame and unbelievably stupid? A killer video game? Do ghosts really know a thing about Playstation?And the game visuals are insulting to anybody who has ever played video games. No game looks like that or plays like that.

Maybe it's because I play a lot of computer games and I thought the premise of a killer video game was really clever (maybe not unique, but well done.)The plot revolves around a mysterious video game being tested by a couple of game testers. No one seems to know its origin, but it soon becomes apparent that when you play the game and your character dies, you soon meet the same fate in real life. The game is based on the real-life serial killer Elizabeth Bathory, a 16th century Hungarian countess who killed and tortured hundreds of girls. The movie takes some liberty with the facts, such as having The Countess, as she's called, move to America, where she finds the requisite spooky old manor to inhabit. The gamers finally figure out what's going on and find the real-life burial place of the Countess. One part I found cool was that while one character played the game on his laptop, he instructed the other one what to do in the actual castle. I found the blending of game and ""reality"" very well-done and intriguing. I won't spoil the ending, but the heroes eventually find the body of the actual Countess, and guess what- she's not dead! (surprise) There is a pretty cool final scene where they battle this vicious vixen, who I thought was one of the coolest movie monsters I've seen in a while.Also included on this DVD is a commentary track, which I found very entertaining.

84791,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,0788869973,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Stay Alive (William Brent Bell, 2006)Ah, the modern horror movie formula. Scads of these movies get made, and no one remembers them a month after they get released to theaters and flop. Here's the formula, if you're an aspiring filmmaker: get a number of young-and-beautiful TV stars together, throw a bland, unscary script at them (optional: twist historical institutions until they bleed in order to suit your needs, as per the Skulls), make the film for a budget small enough that it's guaranteed to make its budget back on opening weekend just on the strength of your cast, spend a few days filming, release. Bell's second feature draws heavily on the formula, with the expected results. Unfortunately, unlike most of these things, there's enough here to intimate that, perhaps, this could have been a pretty good movie, had anyone taken any care with it.The plot: a kid beta-testing a new survival-horror (think Silent Hill or Resident Evil) videogame called Stay Alive dies under mysterious circumstances in the same way his character did in the game. His friend Hutch (Windfall's Jon Foster), guilty over the fact that he wasn't there when his friend died, gets his friend's copy of the game and enlists a number of his compatriots, along with the mysterious, but sexy, Abigail (The O.C.'s Samaire Armstrong)-- whom he met at his friend's funeral, where she inexplicably latched onto him-- to try and figure out if there's any connection between the game and his friend's death. When members of the group start dying, they have to figure out how to stop the game before it kills them all.A more important question that no one, unfortunately, ever thinks to ask, is what a Transylvanian countess is doing in Louisiana. Yep, Elizabeth Bathory has somehow moved to America, and no one questions it. It's little things like this that drive me up the freakin' wall. Of course, that's not all that's wrong with the movie. While the cast (which includes Frankie Muniz of Malcolm in the Middle in his first adult role) all give acceptable performances, there's no real script for them to work against, so they come off as mostly bland and two-dimensional. Muniz is the exception; he brings character to his character, as it were, making Swink a caffeine-junkie ubergeek who's a pleasure whenever he's onscreen. Worse, though, the hand of a butchering editor is at work here, as this film was obviously edited (heavily, in some cases) to garner its kiss-of-death PG-13 rating. What was the last PG-13 horror film you saw that was any good?The good things about the movie are few, but they're certainly there. The videogame scenes are probably the best I've seen in a movie, and Bell didn't try to integrate them into the live action the way someone like Uwe Boll would (think House of the Dead here). The final baddie is also a marvel of creepiness, and she alone would make this movie at least worth a cursory glance. Unfortunately, by the time you get to her, you've probably lost interest.Here is a horror flick that really does deserve a remake, one that would realize the film's potential for great atmosphere, serious gore, and black, black comedy. This iteration could have had all of those things in spades, but it fails at almost every juncture. **",2,"Solid premise, lackluster execution",1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,3255,"['Stay', 'Alive', 'William', 'Brent', 'Bell', '2006', 'Ah', 'modern', 'horror', 'movie', 'formula', 'Scads', 'movies', 'get', 'made', 'one', 'month', 'get', 'released', 'theaters', 'flop', 'Here', 'formula', ""'re"", 'aspiring', 'filmmaker', 'get', 'number', 'young-and-beautiful', 'TV', 'stars', 'together', 'throw', 'bland', 'unscary', 'script', 'optional', 'twist', 'historical', 'institutions', 'bleed', 'order', 'suit', 'needs', 'Skulls', 'make', 'film', 'budget', 'small', 'enough', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'budget', 'back', 'opening', 'weekend', 'just', 'strength', 'cast', 'spend', 'few', 'days', 'filming', 'release', 'Bell', 'second', 'feature', 'heavily', 'formula', 'expected', 'results', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'things', 'enough', 'here', 'intimate', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'had', 'anyone', 'taken', 'care', 'it.The', 'plot', 'kid', 'beta-testing', 'new', 'survival-horror', 'think', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'videogame', 'called', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'dies', 'mysterious', 'circumstances', 'same', 'way', 'character', 'did', 'game', 'friend', 'Hutch', 'Windfall', 'Jon', 'Foster', 'guilty', 'fact', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'when', 'friend', 'died', 'friend', 'copy', 'game', 'number', 'compatriots', 'mysterious', 'sexy', 'Abigail', 'O.C', 'Samaire', 'Armstrong', 'whom', 'met', 'friend', 'funeral', 'where', 'inexplicably', 'latched', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'connection', 'game', 'friend', 'death', 'When', 'members', 'group', 'start', 'dying', 'have', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'stop', 'game', 'all.A', 'more', 'important', 'question', 'one', 'unfortunately', 'ever', 'ask', 'what', 'Transylvanian', 'countess', 'doing', 'Louisiana', 'Yep', 'Elizabeth', 'Bathory', 'somehow', 'moved', 'America', 'one', 'questions', 'little', 'things', 'drive', 'freakin', 'wall', 'course', 'not', 'wrong', 'movie', 'cast', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'first', 'adult', 'role', 'give', 'acceptable', 'performances', 'real', 'script', 'work', 'come', 'off', 'mostly', 'bland', 'two-dimensional', 'Muniz', 'exception', 'character', 'character', 'were', 'making', 'Swink', 'caffeine-junkie', 'ubergeek', 'who', 'pleasure', 'whenever', 'onscreen', 'Worse', 'hand', 'butchering', 'editor', 'work', 'here', 'film', 'was', 'obviously', 'edited', 'heavily', 'cases', 'garner', 'kiss-of-death', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'What', 'was', 'last', 'PG-13', 'horror', 'film', 'saw', 'was', 'good', 'good', 'things', 'movie', 'are', 'few', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'there', 'videogame', 'scenes', 'are', 'probably', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'Bell', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'integrate', 'live', 'action', 'way', 'someone', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'would', 'think', 'House', 'Dead', 'here', 'final', 'baddie', 'also', 'marvel', 'creepiness', 'alone', 'would', 'make', 'movie', 'least', 'cursory', 'glance', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'get', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'lost', 'interest.Here', 'horror', 'flick', 'really', 'deserve', 'remake', 'one', 'would', 'realize', 'film', 'potential', 'great', 'atmosphere', 'serious', 'gore', 'black', 'black', 'comedy', 'iteration', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'things', 'spades', 'almost', 'juncture', '**']",N/A

But the main difference between the two movies is that Jumanji (for its time) was a very good, 4-star movie....Stay Alive is just another average horror film in the plethora of ""just average"" horror films that come out every year.The ""game/art comes to life"" concept is a good one, and when properly executed can be very effective. For example, look how effective the Pilot episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery (1970) was when some guy murders his uncle and the old man's painting of the family graveyard comes to life.The execution in Stay Alive is not very effective. However, it is very predictable: mean characters get killed, drug users get killed and smokers get killed...the movie is just riddled with predictability.The acting is B at best, but overall the B performances work well with the average film-making attempt.

84797,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,0788869973,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[1, 2]","Now here's something I didn't expect - ""Stay Alive"" is one of the year's best and scariest movies.  Being about a video game where, when a player who dies in the game, will end up dying the same way in real life, I thought that in order to be good this movie would have to try to be sort of along the lines of the ""Final Destination"" movies (excellent, especially the second) and somewhat akin to something like the classic ""Night Of The Demons"".  There was another surprise: it was nothing like any of those great movies.  Instead, in style and feel, it ended up much closer to a different kind of great horror movies - things like ""The Ring"" (believe it or not) or even ""In The Mouth Of Madness"".The movie centers around a group of friends who are all, obviously, big fans of video games, especially the horror-oriented ones like 'Silent Hill' and 'Fatal Frame' (both of which are actually mentioned in the movie).  People who don't play video games may think the whole premise is setting itself up for failure, but when you think about it, is it really any different than having a movie where something sinister emerges from a written work centers around characters who read a lot?  The characters in ""Stay Alive"" are, fortunately, depicted as real people, not the dorkish stereotypes I feared we could have ended up with.  One of them comes into possession of an unknown game called 'Stay Alive', believed by the group to be a test copy of a title in the final stages of testing before general release.  After a single night of gameplay, everything's set in motion.The movie avoids the contrasting pitfalls it could have hit.  For example, once the game's been played, say a character died falling off a building, and then the same thing happened to someone in the group a week later.  Nobody's going to say, 'Holy #*/! It must have been the game!' in real life after what could have easily been a coincidence.  It's only after a number of unlikely events start adding up that real alarm bells are triggered.  And then on the other end, we don't have a situation where a half dozen or so people die in exactly the same way as in the game, the very next morning, and then the remaining characters are so bone-headed that they all go and turn it on again that evening.The problem that confronts the characters and solves the would-be question of 'why don't they just smash the disc to bits and be done with it?' is this - once it's started, the game in some fashion continues even when nobody's using it.  So then the question becomes, is it more dangerous to try and confront whatever it is the game has unleashed with or without returning to the game world and attempting to control it?The happenings that are triggered by the game are - how does one put this without spoilers?...  There are reasons things are unfolding as they are, there's a reason why it's a game that triggered it instead of, say, a book or a talisman or what have you (and when it comes out, it becomes apparant that it could have been some different device of tale-telling or depicting concepts and imagery that these phenomenon latched onto, but there's a definate explanation for why it happened to be a game), and there's even a reason why the game's subject matter is what it is.  Things are explained in the latter parts of ""Stay Alive"" to seem plausible but without de-mystifying all the ideas.The frights are good and jolting, and the visual imagery is horrific and very well done.  Some may find fault with the fact that many of the supernatural aspects seem familiar from one game or another, but I prefer to think of it as sort of a homage to all the great horror games out there.  (If you're a horror fan who's never tried some of the field's video game offerings, like Clock Tower or Silent Hill or Haunting Ground, you may want to give them a try.  They're a quality part of the horror field, and the storytelling possibilities with today's systems are way beyond anything anybody would have once thought could be put into a video game)  It's not a blatant copy of any existing game certainly, but there are familiar elements abounding.  Everything came together to work very well and, while it's rather a different style of horror movie than one might expect, it's none the worse for it.  This is a scary, high-quality movie that does some stuff that hasn't been much seen in film.",5,Horrors From A Video Game Make Their Way Into The Real World,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,4372,"['Now', 'here', 'something', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'scariest', 'movies', 'Being', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'when', 'player', 'who', 'game', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'dying', 'same', 'way', 'real', 'life', 'thought', 'order', 'be', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'try', 'be', 'sort', 'lines', 'Final', 'Destination', 'movies', 'excellent', 'especially', 'second', 'somewhat', 'akin', 'something', 'classic', 'Night', 'Demons', 'was', 'surprise', 'was', 'nothing', 'great', 'movies', 'Instead', 'style', 'feel', 'ended', 'up', 'much', 'closer', 'different', 'kind', 'great', 'horror', 'movies', 'things', 'Ring', 'believe', 'not', 'even', 'Mouth', 'Madness', '.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'obviously', 'big', 'fans', 'video', 'games', 'especially', 'horror-oriented', 'ones', ""'Silent"", 'Hill', ""'Fatal"", 'Frame', 'are', 'actually', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'People', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'video', 'games', 'may', 'think', 'whole', 'premise', 'setting', 'up', 'failure', 'when', 'think', 'really', 'different', 'having', 'movie', 'where', 'something', 'sinister', 'written', 'work', 'centers', 'characters', 'who', 'read', 'lot', 'characters', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'are', 'fortunately', 'depicted', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'dorkish', 'stereotypes', 'feared', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'One', 'possession', 'unknown', 'game', 'called', ""'Stay"", 'Alive', 'believed', 'group', 'be', 'test', 'copy', 'title', 'final', 'stages', 'testing', 'general', 'release', 'single', 'night', 'gameplay', 'everything', 'set', 'motion.The', 'movie', 'contrasting', 'pitfalls', 'could', 'have', 'hit', 'example', 'once', 'game', 'been', 'played', 'say', 'character', 'died', 'falling', 'off', 'building', 'then', 'same', 'thing', 'happened', 'someone', 'group', 'week', 'later', 'Nobody', 'going', 'say', ""'Holy"", '*/', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'game', 'real', 'life', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'coincidence', 'only', 'number', 'unlikely', 'events', 'start', 'adding', 'up', 'real', 'alarm', 'bells', 'are', 'triggered', 'then', 'other', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'situation', 'where', 'half', 'dozen', 'so', 'people', 'die', 'exactly', 'same', 'way', 'game', 'very', 'next', 'morning', 'then', 'remaining', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'bone-headed', 'go', 'turn', 'again', 'evening.The', 'problem', 'characters', 'would-be', 'question', ""'why"", 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'smash', 'disc', 'bits', 'be', 'done', 'started', 'game', 'fashion', 'even', 'when', 'nobody', 'using', 'So', 'then', 'question', 'becomes', 'more', 'dangerous', 'try', 'confront', 'whatever', 'game', 'unleashed', 'returning', 'game', 'world', 'attempting', 'control', 'happenings', 'are', 'triggered', 'game', 'are', 'how', 'one', 'put', 'spoilers', 'are', 'reasons', 'things', 'are', 'unfolding', 'are', 'reason', 'why', 'game', 'triggered', 'instead', 'say', 'book', 'talisman', 'what', 'have', 'when', 'out', 'apparant', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'different', 'device', 'tale-telling', 'depicting', 'concepts', 'imagery', 'phenomenon', 'latched', 'definate', 'explanation', 'why', 'happened', 'be', 'game', 'even', 'reason', 'why', 'game', 'subject', 'matter', 'what', 'Things', 'are', 'explained', 'latter', 'parts', 'Stay', 'Alive', 'seem', 'plausible', 'de-mystifying', 'ideas.The', 'frights', 'are', 'good', 'jolting', 'visual', 'imagery', 'horrific', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'may', 'find', 'fault', 'fact', 'many', 'supernatural', 'aspects', 'seem', 'familiar', 'one', 'game', 'prefer', 'think', 'sort', 'homage', 'great', 'horror', 'games', 'out', 'there', ""'re"", 'horror', 'fan', 'who', 'never', 'tried', 'field', 'video', 'game', 'offerings', 'Clock', 'Tower', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Haunting', 'Ground', 'may', 'want', 'give', 'try', ""'re"", 'quality', 'part', 'horror', 'field', 'storytelling', 'possibilities', 'today', 'systems', 'are', 'way', 'anything', 'anybody', 'would', 'have', 'once', 'thought', 'could', 'be', 'put', 'video', 'game', 'not', 'blatant', 'copy', 'existing', 'game', 'certainly', 'are', 'familiar', 'elements', 'abounding', 'Everything', 'came', 'together', 'work', 'very', 'well', 'rather', 'different', 'style', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'none', 'worse', 'scary', 'high-quality', 'movie', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'been', 'much', 'seen', 'film']",N/A
84798,A29EEL0560NVG7,0788869973,"Steve67 ""Steve500067""","[4, 13]","The story basically follows a group of gamer teens who lost a friend recently due to unsual circumstances.They discover that around his death he played an unreleased game called Stay Alive, which is loosely based on the legend of Elizabeth Bathory, A woman who was rumored to bath in the blood of young women in the delusion that it would keep her from aging. After the funeral the group gets togethor and decides to try the game out. Normally survival horror games are one player to keep the scary atmosphere going, but in this case we've got a handful of people playing togethor, which essentially ends up more like an action game. Shortly after they stop playing strange things begin happening, and naturally the bodies start pilling up. It does'nt take long before our leads link the game to the deaths of their friends, especially since they seem to die in the same way as they did in the game. From the misleading pictures and the look of the poster, it would seem like the audience would be in for a gory ride-incorrect. The film actually does'nt have much as far as gore, and when some was shown it was a very quick shot. I suppose this was to be expected considering the PG-13 rating. Aside from that, Another big faultis the fact that stuff from the game actually appears in real life, like the ''Blood Countess'' who shows up in more than one occasion. It looks good on the game, but not when it's mixed with live action, because then we are just witness to some really cheesy looking computer generated images. What they failed to realize was just because something in the game is scary does'nt mean it will be scary in person. Maybe if they had an actual live person playing the Blood Countess it would be somewhat scary, but not when it the same woman from the the game. Before the movie was released the creators expressed intrest in creating the actual game if the movie resulted in big numbers at the box office. It does not look like that will happening. Overall I would have to say it was midly entertaining, but the game itself seemed much scaier than the film was.

I can't wait for nanotechnology to take off.There is a crew of young adults who find out about the negative issues of the game after several of their friends have died from it and they are in the middle of playing the game. Hutch (Jon Foster) is the main character and a big gamer. Due to a childhood accident he is afraid of fire, even so much as someone lighting a cigarette. This should have been better developed. October (Sophia Bush) is his girlfriend and a bit of a goth. Her brother is Phineus (Jimmi Simpson) who is the realist in the group and doesn't but into the game/death idea. Frankie Muniz is Swink, who appears to be a geek who quickly respects the game, a character that needed to be better developed also. Abigail (Samaire Armstrong) provides the eye candy and is an outsider to the group who invites herself in. This aspect wasn't really utilized.The film is scarier in the beginning. It doesn't maintain the scare factor because it does the same stuff over and over, so they tend to add some gore to it.
