1670968,AFXTKAO0CB354,B00FAI3GOE,C. Weaver,"[3, 3]","Once again, I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed the newest English release of Ikki Tousen. Great Guardians follows the first two collections as one of my favorite series. This time, it re-introduced us to a more ""fleshed-out"" character brought back from death. (I won't go into plot details as it would spoil it for others.) It was nice to have this character back as I felt she added a bit more scope to one of the other characters. Even though this was a great set, it's plot was not quite as good as the first two, but still very nice.

I was initially was like, 'oh, Anime Works finally got their finances in order and released it.' Then I realized it was put out by Funimation. Since Ikki Tousen has been through the hands of Geneon, Anime Works, and now Funimation, I'm keeping my fingers crossed nothing happens between now and March when the fourth season is released.Now, as for the third season, I'm keeping it short as to not give out too much info.The third season is not as good as the first two seasons. The artwork is great and I'm glad they managed to get some of the original voice actors from season 1 back. But...The first two seasons the stories were fast paced, the fight scenes kicked ass, and the fan service was over the top. Now they just meander their way through the story, the fights are a bit lack luster, even the fan service is not as good. Maybe the writers are running out of steam.But, I'm still glad they released it and I'm happy to have it in my collection. And I'm looking forward to the fourth season.",4,It's about time!,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",2014,1059,"['happened', 'discover', 'third', 'series', 'was', 'out', 'chance', 'was', 'initially', 'was', ""'oh"", 'Anime', 'Works', 'finally', 'got', 'finances', 'order', 'released', 'Then', 'realized', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'Funimation', 'Ikki', 'Tousen', 'been', 'hands', 'Geneon', 'Anime', 'Works', 'now', 'Funimation', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'fingers', 'crossed', 'nothing', 'happens', 'now', 'March', 'when', 'fourth', 'season', 'released.Now', 'third', 'season', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'short', 'not', 'give', 'out', 'too', 'much', 'info.The', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'artwork', 'great', ""'m"", 'glad', 'managed', 'get', 'original', 'voice', 'actors', 'season', '1', 'back', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'stories', 'were', 'fast', 'paced', 'fight', 'scenes', 'kicked', 'ass', 'fan', 'service', 'was', 'top', 'Now', 'just', 'meander', 'way', 'story', 'fights', 'are', 'bit', 'lack', 'luster', 'even', 'fan', 'service', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Maybe', 'writers', 'are', 'running', 'steam.But', ""'m"", 'still', 'glad', 'released', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'collection', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'fourth', 'season']",Ikki Tousen: Great Guardians: Complete Series 1-12

It's just that I can go anywhere else for the sake of T&A.; I'm one of those people who don't wanna feel like they wasted my &#34;SUPPORT THE INDUSTRY, DAMN YOU!!&#34; money. I'd like a good story and good characters that rewards viewers with T&A; instead of the other way around.The Ikki Tousen series isn't necessarily bad; ala &#34;Koihime Musou series and it's 'WE HATE (YOUNG) MEN' stigma&#34; bad. It's mainly a series about people with pasts of ancient Chinese warriors either repeating history, fighting against it, or getting revenge because of it. The idea with &#34;the main female characters wiping the floor with nameless thugs&#34; hurts my head and they need to stop IMMHO.I appreciate FUNi picking up where Media Blasters fumbled; but I find the dissing of Media Blasters stupid.
