30511,A28WJUJF6D2ULA,0780621638,Dai-keag-ity,"[2, 3]","""Come in from the cold"" the tagline to 1997's The Winter Guest invites us, and viewers who accept this faint beckoning soon look on as the cast of this unique production from Scotland does just that in one singularly metaphorical fashion or another. This is a quiet movie that says little with the spoken word and yet still tells one of the most poignantly rich stories ever committed to film. The Winter Guest takes place all in one frozen winter day in a town in rural Scotland, and brings four intertwined vignettes together as it imparts its barely whispered and unforgettable tales. There is a grieving young widow's resistance to her mother's attempts to brings her out of her deep depression; there are two boys who skip school and retreat to the frozen seashore to hide out for the day in this the last winter of their already fleeting childhood; there are two elderly ladies who bravely stare back at death by traveling to funerals of people barely known to them; and there is an eccentric girl, Nita, who forces a boy she fancies---Alex, the son of the widow, Frances, played by Emma Thompson---to finally take notice of her via a playfully serious confrontation amid the ice-covered streets of the little town they share. The Winter Guest would simply never have been made in America, nor could it have been. It is a story that requires patience, sensitivity and insight into the human condition, and for the investment of all of these, returns the sort of intelligently psychological motion picture that is all but extinct in this decade.",5,The Winter Guest,1196812800,"12 5, 2007",2007,1550,"['Come', 'cold', 'tagline', '1997', 'Winter', 'Guest', 'viewers', 'who', 'accept', 'faint', 'beckoning', 'soon', 'look', 'cast', 'unique', 'production', 'Scotland', 'just', 'one', 'singularly', 'metaphorical', 'fashion', 'quiet', 'movie', 'little', 'spoken', 'word', 'yet', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'poignantly', 'rich', 'stories', 'ever', 'committed', 'film', 'Winter', 'Guest', 'place', 'one', 'frozen', 'winter', 'day', 'town', 'rural', 'Scotland', 'four', 'intertwined', 'vignettes', 'together', 'barely', 'whispered', 'unforgettable', 'tales', 'grieving', 'young', 'widow', 'resistance', 'mother', 'attempts', 'brings', 'deep', 'depression', 'are', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'skip', 'school', 'retreat', 'frozen', 'seashore', 'hide', 'out', 'day', 'last', 'winter', 'already', 'fleeting', 'childhood', 'are', 'two', 'elderly', 'ladies', 'who', 'bravely', 'stare', 'back', 'death', 'traveling', 'funerals', 'people', 'barely', 'known', 'eccentric', 'girl', 'Nita', 'who', 'boy', '-Alex', 'son', 'widow', 'Frances', 'played', 'Emma', 'Thompson', '-to', 'finally', 'take', 'notice', 'playfully', 'serious', 'confrontation', 'ice-covered', 'streets', 'little', 'town', 'share', 'Winter', 'Guest', 'would', 'simply', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'America', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'story', 'patience', 'sensitivity', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'investment', 'sort', 'intelligently', 'psychological', 'motion', 'picture', 'extinct', 'decade']",The Winter Guest VHS
30512,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0780621638,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[5, 6]","With Alan Rickman's commitment in playing Professor Snape in the Harry Potter movies, it's doubtful he will ever return to the director's chair to deliver a memorable movie such as this.At a Scottish coastal town facing the North Sea, the sea has frozen over so that it's like a wonderland, with an endless horizon.  The discovery of new horizons in the experience of life is key to The Winter Guest.Four dual relationships are examined here.  The first is that between Frances and her mother.  Frances (Emma Thompson) is a recently widowed photographer who lives in a studio flat with her young son.  Her mother (Thompson's real-life mother Phyllida Law), has walked all the way from her house, minus her walking stick, to break the defensive barrier Frances has erected.  The mother keeps chatting on, fixing the bed, but Frances at first spends time avoiding her in the bathroom.The confrontation is much on the mother trying to get Frances to live again, to become full of life.  As she tells her daughter on some photographs, &quot;Why not use colour?  The world's in colour.&quot;  And why photograph buildings instead of people?  The mother is more in colour and livelier than the death that has gutted Frances of any feeling of life.  She firmly believes that &quot;it's the kingdom of youth we're living in&quot; in response to Frances's defeatist talk of embracing the years and welcoming instead of fighting them.  She wants the best for her daughter and if it takes being emotionally overbossy, so be it.  &quot;A happy woman does not ruin her own beauty&quot;, as she believes Frances has done by her haircut.Alex, Frances's son, has an unexpected encounter with Nita, a dark-haired tomboy who gains his attention.  Nita's more impulsive, daring Alex to walk on the ice, and Alex is more cautious, perhaps living under the gloomy shadow of his father's death and the aura of his mother.  Alex's grandmother espies the two from the flat and while seeing the encounter as normal, all the same speaks to herself.  &quot;Be careful.  It wants that face.  Give her the moon, she'll want the stars as well.&quot;  Fortunately, Nita isn't that way at all.The thin bespectacled Lily and fat Chloe are two elderly women who keep themselves occupied attending funerals to the point of looking through the paper and jotting them down on appointment books.  Chloe, though seemingly dotty, proves to be the more lively and stronger of the two, literally on the bus and metaphorically having the window seat.  Yet they wonder about today's ways.  &quot;There's nothing like watching a coffin slip down to the earth and the soil thudding down.&quot;  They question cremations and how that squares with conservation and ecology.Tom and Sam are two truant youngsters in their early teens and they hang out on the shore talking about things.  The red-haired Sam is shorter but is more in tune, more aware of things than his taller friend.  He has hopes for a future, whereas Tom feels hopeless, resigned to a fate of pushing carts at a food mart.  There's little to do other than go to school and be at home and obey one's parents, and what's it all for, wonders Tom?Of the pairs, it's clear who emerges as the stronger and braver of the two.  However, one of them turns out to embrace that spirit of hope and possibility, surprising the ostensibly more assertive one.  All the pairs work wonderfully together in this slow-paced drama.The Scottish coast town is bleak yet wonderful, a place I'd like to visit or even live in one day.  The setting appears to be in Fife County, separated from Edinburgh by the Firth of Forth.  Michael Kamen's haunting piano score, most of it in a higher octave, matches that bleak and wonderful tone, as does the closing song &quot;Take Me With You&quot; by Elizabeth Fraser.It all comes down to that certain strong and loving someone saying, as Lily tells Chloe, &quot;You will not fall while I'm here.&quot;",5,Bleak yet wonderful... with magical horizons ahead,1062028800,"08 28, 2003",2003,3937,"['Alan', 'Rickman', 'commitment', 'playing', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'doubtful', 'will', 'ever', 'return', 'director', 'chair', 'deliver', 'memorable', 'movie', 'such', 'this.At', 'Scottish', 'coastal', 'town', 'facing', 'North', 'Sea', 'sea', 'frozen', 'so', 'wonderland', 'endless', 'horizon', 'discovery', 'new', 'horizons', 'experience', 'life', 'key', 'Winter', 'Guest.Four', 'dual', 'relationships', 'are', 'examined', 'here', 'first', 'Frances', 'mother', 'Frances', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'recently', 'widowed', 'photographer', 'who', 'studio', 'flat', 'young', 'son', 'mother', 'Thompson', 'real-life', 'mother', 'Phyllida', 'Law', 'walked', 'way', 'house', 'walking', 'stick', 'break', 'defensive', 'barrier', 'Frances', 'erected', 'mother', 'chatting', 'fixing', 'bed', 'Frances', 'first', 'spends', 'time', 'avoiding', 'bathroom.The', 'confrontation', 'much', 'mother', 'trying', 'get', 'Frances', 'live', 'again', 'become', 'full', 'life', 'daughter', 'photographs', 'quot', 'Why', 'not', 'use', 'colour', 'world', 'colour.', 'quot', 'why', 'photograph', 'buildings', 'instead', 'people', 'mother', 'more', 'colour', 'livelier', 'death', 'gutted', 'Frances', 'feeling', 'life', 'firmly', 'quot', 'kingdom', 'youth', ""'re"", 'living', 'quot', 'response', 'Frances', 'defeatist', 'talk', 'embracing', 'years', 'welcoming', 'instead', 'fighting', 'best', 'daughter', 'being', 'emotionally', 'overbossy', 'so', 'be', 'quot', 'A', 'happy', 'woman', 'not', 'ruin', 'own', 'beauty', 'quot', 'Frances', 'done', 'haircut.Alex', 'Frances', 'son', 'unexpected', 'encounter', 'Nita', 'dark-haired', 'tomboy', 'who', 'gains', 'attention', 'Nita', 'more', 'impulsive', 'daring', 'Alex', 'walk', 'ice', 'Alex', 'more', 'cautious', 'perhaps', 'living', 'gloomy', 'shadow', 'father', 'death', 'aura', 'mother', 'Alex', 'grandmother', 'two', 'flat', 'seeing', 'encounter', 'normal', 'same', 'speaks', 'herself', 'quot', 'Be', 'careful', 'face', 'Give', 'moon', ""'ll"", 'want', 'stars', 'well.', 'quot', 'Fortunately', 'Nita', ""n't"", 'way', 'all.The', 'thin', 'bespectacled', 'Lily', 'fat', 'Chloe', 'are', 'two', 'elderly', 'women', 'who', 'keep', 'occupied', 'attending', 'funerals', 'point', 'looking', 'paper', 'jotting', 'down', 'appointment', 'books', 'Chloe', 'seemingly', 'dotty', 'be', 'more', 'lively', 'stronger', 'two', 'literally', 'bus', 'metaphorically', 'having', 'window', 'seat', 'wonder', 'today', 'ways', 'quot', 'nothing', 'watching', 'coffin', 'slip', 'down', 'earth', 'soil', 'thudding', 'down.', 'quot', 'question', 'cremations', 'how', 'conservation', 'ecology.Tom', 'Sam', 'are', 'two', 'truant', 'youngsters', 'early', 'teens', 'hang', 'out', 'shore', 'talking', 'things', 'red-haired', 'Sam', 'shorter', 'more', 'tune', 'more', 'aware', 'things', 'taller', 'friend', 'hopes', 'future', 'whereas', 'Tom', 'feels', 'hopeless', 'resigned', 'fate', 'pushing', 'carts', 'food', 'mart', 'little', 'do', 'other', 'go', 'school', 'be', 'home', 'obey', 'one', 'parents', 'what', 'wonders', 'Tom', 'pairs', 'clear', 'who', 'stronger', 'braver', 'two', 'However', 'one', 'out', 'embrace', 'spirit', 'hope', 'possibility', 'surprising', 'ostensibly', 'more', 'assertive', 'one', 'pairs', 'work', 'wonderfully', 'together', 'slow-paced', 'drama.The', 'Scottish', 'coast', 'town', 'bleak', 'yet', 'wonderful', 'place', ""'d"", 'like', 'visit', 'even', 'live', 'one', 'day', 'setting', 'be', 'Fife', 'County', 'separated', 'Edinburgh', 'Firth', 'Forth', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'haunting', 'piano', 'score', 'most', 'higher', 'octave', 'matches', 'bleak', 'wonderful', 'tone', 'closing', 'song', 'quot', 'Take', 'Me', 'quot', 'Elizabeth', 'Fraser.It', 'down', 'certain', 'strong', 'loving', 'someone', 'saying', 'Lily', 'Chloe', 'quot', 'will', 'not', 'fall', ""'m"", 'here.', 'quot']",The Winter Guest VHS

30515,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,0780621638,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[93, 95]","The setting for &quot;The Winter Guest&quot; (based on the stage play) is a small fishing village in Scotland where the sea is frozen as far as the  eye can see. Frances (Emma Thompson) is a professional photographer mired  in grief over the recent death of her husband. She cannot make herself  climb out of bed -- even for her son. Photographs Frances took of her  deceased husband line the walls and run up the stairs. At one point during  the film her son tells a friend their house is haunted and his dead father  has imprisoned his mother.One cold winter day, Frances' mother Elspeth  (Phyllida Law--Emma's real mother) comes calling -- she is the 'winter  guest.' She encourages Frances to start living again. At Elspeth's urging,  she and Frances spend the day together walking and talking in the frozen  landscape -- Frances with her camera in hand and Elspeth with her  cigarettes. At the end of the walk, Frances seems a bit less grieved and  the frozen space between the mother and daughter has thawed.Three  subplots have been worked into the main tale: two small boys playing hooky;  Frances' son meeting a new girl; and two older ladies taking the #22 bus to  an out of town funeral.Alan Rickman dircted this masterpiece of  stunning visual beauty. The film consists of shot after shot of black and  white photographs suitable for framing. Some color is provided by the  occasional jumper (sweater) or other inanimate object, but mostly this is a  black and white film. If you're fascinated with photograpy and/or  cinematography, you will enjoy this film. The musical score is lovely and  quite appropriate for the setting (piano solos by Michael Kamen with a  female vocal during the final credits).The photography reminds me a bit  of the footage from &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; though most of it is  very original.  The story line is reminiscent of &quot;Truly, Madly,  Deeply&quot; which starred Rickman.  This is a thoughtful film. My husband  has watched it twice, so I don't think it appeals only to women.",5,A work of visual beauty....,966556800,"08 18, 2000",2000,2034,"['setting', 'quot', 'Winter', 'Guest', 'quot', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'Scotland', 'where', 'sea', 'frozen', 'as', 'far', 'eye', 'can', 'see', 'Frances', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'professional', 'photographer', 'mired', 'grief', 'recent', 'death', 'husband', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'climb', 'bed', 'even', 'son', 'Photographs', 'Frances', 'took', 'deceased', 'husband', 'line', 'walls', 'run', 'up', 'stairs', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'son', 'friend', 'house', 'haunted', 'dead', 'father', 'imprisoned', 'mother.One', 'cold', 'winter', 'day', 'Frances', 'mother', 'Elspeth', 'Phyllida', 'Law', 'Emma', 'real', 'mother', 'calling', ""'winter"", 'guest', 'Frances', 'start', 'living', 'again', 'Elspeth', 'urging', 'Frances', 'spend', 'day', 'together', 'walking', 'talking', 'frozen', 'landscape', 'Frances', 'camera', 'hand', 'Elspeth', 'cigarettes', 'end', 'walk', 'Frances', 'bit', 'less', 'grieved', 'frozen', 'space', 'mother', 'daughter', 'thawed.Three', 'subplots', 'have', 'been', 'worked', 'main', 'tale', 'two', 'small', 'boys', 'playing', 'hooky', 'Frances', 'son', 'meeting', 'new', 'girl', 'two', 'older', 'ladies', 'taking', '22', 'bus', 'out', 'town', 'funeral.Alan', 'Rickman', 'dircted', 'masterpiece', 'stunning', 'visual', 'beauty', 'film', 'shot', 'shot', 'black', 'white', 'photographs', 'suitable', 'framing', 'color', 'provided', 'occasional', 'jumper', 'sweater', 'other', 'inanimate', 'object', 'mostly', 'black', 'white', 'film', ""'re"", 'fascinated', 'photograpy', 'and/or', 'cinematography', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'musical', 'score', 'lovely', 'quite', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'piano', 'solos', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'female', 'vocal', 'final', 'credits', '.The', 'photography', 'bit', 'footage', 'quot', 'Sweet', 'Hereafter', 'quot', 'most', 'very', 'original', 'story', 'line', 'reminiscent', 'quot', 'Truly', 'Madly', 'Deeply', 'quot', 'starred', 'Rickman', 'thoughtful', 'film', 'husband', 'watched', 'twice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'appeals', 'only', 'women']",The Winter Guest VHS

30520,A245AST0T0AZTJ,0780621638,J. Lindner,"[1, 5]","I'm not really sure what attracted me to this film, but once I started watching it I couldn't stop.  Perhaps it was the dreariness of the setting, or the obnoxiousness of the dialog, but I guess the main reason I watched was to see if a plot ever realy developed.  I kept hoping that something of significance would eventually happen, but it really never did.The characters are quirky and shallow.  You don't know much more about them than when the film began.  The older mother kept asking her adult daughter if she would be moving to Australia.  To me it was a simple yes/no question, but the daughter couldn't come out and give a yes or a no.  The two elderly women heading to a out of town funeral don't do much to carry the stroy, either.  The young man and woman have their moments, but they, too don't add much to the story.

Each coupling is given ample weight and time to ruminate on life, it's meaning, it's hopes and it's dreams,it's ending and the need for human (and even animal) companionship. The acting is absolutely superb and is a must see for fans of the live theatre who enjoy low action, heavy dialogue and thought prevoking entertainment. What is most impressive about this film is the deliberate pacing and weight given to each word and  action very much like a play. Every moment counts in this film. Nothing is a throwaway. The scenery is intentionally cold and bleak and the lack of warm colours throughout most of the film serve to heighten the angst  greatly.WINTER GUEST is an incredibly intimate film and will probably be enjoyed and savoured most either alone or with a special someone. Settle in with this film as it is a rare piece of art!Michael Kamen's soundtrack of piano and light orchestra is positively inspired to underscore the intensity of this dramatic masterpiece.This set this film apart from just being a play on film along with the cinematography of genius Seamus McGarvey who contrasts the vastness of the frozen sea with the closeup of the human face.....really first class!!!An excellent companion piece to WINTER GUEST would be SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE which explores the similar theme of the importance of connection.",5,Take me with You on life's journey,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,2030,"['World', 'famous', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'cowrote', 'directed', 'sleepy', 'little', 'gem', 'film.As', 'seen', 'lives', 'four', 'pairings', 'people', 'single', 'cold', 'winter', 'day', 'Scotland', 'musings', 'observations', 'life', 'cradle', 'grave', 'necessity', 'connection', 'are', 'explored.The', 'screenplay', 'adapted', 'play', 'quite', 'obvious', 'watching', 'character-rich', 'drama', 'touched', 'sincerity', 'sagacity', 'sometimes', 'first', 'coupling', 'people', 'elderly', 'mother', 'recently', 'widowed', 'daughter', 'second', 'two', 'spinsterly', 'ladies', 'third', 'teenage', 'boy', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'lastly', 'two', 'pubescent', 'boy', 'chums', 'playing', 'hooky', 'school', 'coupling', 'given', 'ample', 'weight', 'time', 'ruminate', 'life', 'meaning', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'ending', 'need', 'human', 'even', 'animal', 'companionship', 'acting', 'absolutely', 'superb', 'must', 'see', 'fans', 'live', 'theatre', 'who', 'enjoy', 'low', 'action', 'heavy', 'dialogue', 'thought', 'prevoking', 'entertainment', 'What', 'most', 'impressive', 'film', 'deliberate', 'pacing', 'weight', 'given', 'word', 'action', 'very', 'much', 'play', 'moment', 'film', 'Nothing', 'throwaway', 'scenery', 'intentionally', 'cold', 'bleak', 'lack', 'warm', 'colours', 'most', 'film', 'serve', 'heighten', 'angst', 'greatly.WINTER', 'GUEST', 'incredibly', 'intimate', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'savoured', 'most', 'alone', 'special', 'someone', 'Settle', 'film', 'rare', 'piece', 'art', 'Michael', 'Kamen', 'soundtrack', 'piano', 'light', 'orchestra', 'positively', 'inspired', 'underscore', 'intensity', 'dramatic', 'masterpiece.This', 'set', 'film', 'apart', 'just', 'being', 'play', 'film', 'cinematography', 'genius', 'Seamus', 'McGarvey', 'who', 'vastness', 'frozen', 'sea', 'closeup', 'human', 'face', '..really', 'first', 'class', 'excellent', 'companion', 'piece', 'WINTER', 'GUEST', 'would', 'be', 'SUNDAY', 'IN', 'THE', 'PARK', 'WITH', 'GEORGE', 'similar', 'theme', 'importance', 'connection']",The Winter Guest VHS

30529,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0780621638,Reviewer,"[15, 15]","When you break it down, life comes in stages; not just stages of development, but stages that can last for a moment, an hour, a day-- or indefinitely.  And they come unbidden and unannounced, like an uninvited guest that drops by and burrows into your very soul to ferret out the deepest hopes, dreams, needs and desires which-- consciously or subconsciously-- are a part of everyone who draws a breath upon the planet.  In spring, that guest may bring the joy of rebirth and life; in winter, it may bring a reflection of need and confusion, a feeling of loneliness and loss, the desperation of uncertainty or even despair, all born in that seemingly endless moment of searching and seeking out that elusive and intangible something that lies ahead, just out of reach.  The winter guest you can neither refuse nor turn away that is desolation of spirit; a visitor to whom we are introduced in ""The Winter Guest,"" directed by Alan Rickman.It's an especially cold February in a small village on the coast of Scotland; even the ocean is frozen for as far as the eye can see.  And in the harsh wind that blows in from that frozen sea, we find Frances (Emma Thompson), a woman who has lost her husband, and visited by the winter of indecision is held fast in her confusion, unable to move on with her life.  There to help her find the warmth of spring is Elspeth (Phyllida Law), her mother, who needs Frances as much as Frances needs her, though neither can find a way to break through the chill that has engulfed their souls.  Then there is Alex (Gary Hollywood), Frances's son, still in school, but on the brink of maturity awaiting on the other side of his own winter, a taste of which he samples in the form of Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a local girl who takes a fancy to him.Before it's through, the winter guest will visit others, as well; those in every stage of life.  At one end of the spectrum are Lily and Chloe (Sheila Reid and Sandra Voe), elderly friends who seem to stave off the inevitable by attending funerals.  At the other end are Sam and Tom (Douglas Murphy and Sean Biggerstaff), boys on the cusp of adolescence, who during their visit will learn that being of a like age does not put them at the same stage of life.  And as the story unfolds, in each relationship a different stage of life is revealed and examined, and we see the effects of this winter guest on each.Written by Rickman and Sharman Macdonald (adapted from Macdonald's play), this film is a study in contrasts, a pensive portraiture of life; sparse and reflective, Rickman captures in it the human condition at it's most fragile, and therein finds beauty.  He uses the original music (written and performed by Michael Kamen) sparingly, opting instead for the sound of the wind, the cry of the gulls overhead or just a backdrop of silence to underscore the dialogue and the drama of the story, all to great effectiveness.  By so doing, he allows the drama to speak for itself, to play out thoughtfully and in such a way that the audience is drawn in and included, very reminiscent of Ingmar Bergman's style, though perhaps a bit more wistful at times.  And Rickman allows so many wonderfully telling moments in this film:  The young boy, Tom, looking out at the vast frozen ocean that seemingly extends on and on forever, as if he is looking out upon his own life, which even now is extending on ahead of him, forever; or Frances, looking out upon that same ocean, a frozen sea reaching out into the unknown, even as her own life is moving on toward an unknown destination; Sam, the same age as Tom, yet younger, watching from the shore, not yet ready and therefore unable to follow as Tom ventures out into the mists that cover the frozen waters.  And there's more:  Alex and Nita embracing their passion; Chloe, falling and grabbing hold of a railing for support, then finally reaching out to Lily; Elspeth and Tom, sitting together on a rock and sharing a moment at the shore; Frances taking Elspeth by the arm and helping her.  All moments that are profound in their simplicity, and all wonderfully presented by Rickman, with not only the eye, but the heart, of a true artist.Phyllida Law gives an especially engaging performance as Elspeth, as does Voe as Chloe; and Biggerstaff and Murphy are a delight to watch as Tom and Sam.  But the lovely Emma Thompson steals the show as Frances, with a superb, introspective and reserved performance that is entirely captivating.  She successfully conveys that deepest yearning that so readily identifies the winter into which Frances has entered in her soul, and her scenes with Law (her real life mother) are a subtle expression of reality, and a joy to behold.  But again, it's the prolonged moments of silence--created and staged so well by Rickman-- that are beguiling, and say so much about who Frances really is.  it's such a treat to find a film in which the director is wise enough and so willing to allow enough time for his performer to do what she does best-- as Rickman did with Thompson here-- the positive impact of which is certainly evident in the depth of Thompson's portrayal of Frances.The supporting cast includes Tom Watson (Minister) and Alan Rickman (Man in the Street).  Rickman found beauty in the bleak, frozen landscape of that small, Scottish village, then translated it so well into a representation of those troubling and disorienting transitional periods that can visit us at any given stage of our lives.  And, combined with his artistic eye and insight into human nature, it makes ""The Winter Guest"" a film to be embraced and cherished.  It's an experience you'll long remember.",5,Terrific Performance by Emma Thompson,1012435200,"01 31, 2002",2002,5638,"['When', 'break', 'down', 'life', 'stages', 'not', 'just', 'stages',

I kept waiting for the next scene with Emma and her mother but. when it came, all they did was trudge along through the gorgeous scenery carping at each other.If you want an excellent film about mother/daughter relationships and mortality, rent &quot;Terms of Endearment.&quot;  The scenery's not as beautiful as this one, but the script's a lot better.",2,Like watching ice melt,997574400,"08 12, 2001",2001,1049,"['Yes', 'loved', 'scenery', 'only', 'thing', 'quot', 'moving', 'quot', 'film', 'was', 'bus.Well', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'did', 'interplay', 'Emma', 'Thompson', 'character', 'mother', 'point', 'mother', 'character', 'really', 'did', 'become', 'annoying', ""'d"", 'asked', 'once', 'more', 'quot', 'Are', 'going', 'Australia', 'quot', ""'d"", 'have', 'thrown', 'shoe', 'television', 'screen.The', 'other', 'stories', 'were', 'not', 'interesting', 'Emma', 'son', 'who', 'rather', 'odd', 'sexually', 'aggressive', 'female', 'hot', 'bath', 'really', 'just', 'bath', 'two', 'little', 'old', 'ladies', 'hobby', 'attending', 'funerals', 'two', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'overly', 'concerned', 'development', 'primary', 'sexual', 'attributes', 'kept', 'waiting', 'next', 'scene', 'Emma', 'mother', 'when', 'came', 'did', 'was', 'trudge', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'carping', 'other.If', 'want', 'excellent', 'film', 'mother/daughter', 'relationships', 'mortality', 'rent', 'quot', 'Terms', 'Endearment.', 'quot', 'scenery', 'not', 'as', 'beautiful', 'one', 'script', 'lot', 'better']",The Winter Guest VHS

30533,A18C1PCR8WUAST,0780621638,"Tracy Hodson ""Awi Usdi""","[112, 120]","""The Winter Guest"" is Alan Rickman's first film as a director, and what a film it is. Having directed it first in the West End, he makes the transition to film with remarkable ease.Masterfully acted by his dear friends Emma Thompson and her real-life mum, Phyllida Law as the titular ""Guest"" (the literal guest--the metaphorical ""guest"" is the unknown/death/the next stage of growth). She's a rather unwelcome visitor to her grieving daughter's home--having just lost her husband to death she just wants to be left alone. Rickman does something which is becoming rarer and rarer amongst directors: he reveals the characters rather than trying to dazzle us with ""aren't I a genius first-time-director"" trickery designed to call attention to him, rather than to  his story.  He does this by using simple, quiet but absolutely exquisite cinematography (by Seamus McGarvey) to capture the wild beauty of the far north of Scotland in the dead of a harsh but beautiful winter, creating almost moonscapes; he allows his actors to work within long takes so that they can fully immerse themselves in their scenes; he artfully intercuts between characters' gestures so as to create a psychological connection that is subtle but significant and is seen first as the approaching Elspeth [Law] slips and grabs a metal handrail, then he cuts to Frances [Thompson] grabbing her metal bed frame as she turns sleeping--this is a Nicolas Roeg technique which serves to wordlessly communicate the connection between the two and is a great example of the uniqueness of the language of cinema, and of how a full grasp of that language deepens a film immeasurably--and very importantly, like the great German director Werner Herzog, he is unafraid of silence and allows it to take us into the center of the film. The simple and non-intrusive score is by the late, great Michael Kamen (who is sorely missed), and is mostly comprised of ""incidental"" music--songs occuring naturally as someone plays the piano or sings a traditional song. This has the effect of creating atmosphere and the sense that this is life, not a movie. That a first time director should have been able to do all of this without fear of being ""unfashionably"" non-showy is quite remarkable; from the first frame it was clear that he has it in him to become a director of note, should he choose to follow that path. That two such great British actresses trusted him fully was a great vote of confidence (Law had played this role in The West End play which preceded the film, as several of the other actors involved in the film had, as well).Adapted by Rickman and Sharman MacDonald from her play, which Rickman was involved in from the start, the story is actually comprised of four inter-woven stories, four pairs of people, each of whom are in the midst of some sort of existential struggle (do not mistake this for pretension); the action takes place all in one day, during which all of the characters have come to some sort of internal crisis; the film is about the negotiating each of them do through these deep changes, all of which touch on death in one way or another. All good stories are about just that--the moments when someone is forced to turn, to make choices, to move through a difficulty with grace, making space for the needs of others without relinquishing one's own needs. This is big content to manage within a single day, but Rickman intercuts between these four conflicted pairs seamlessly, giving each of them his full attention. The day itself is remarkable--so cold is it that everything is covered deep in snow and the sea has actually frozen, a rare occurrence.The main pair is mother Elspeth and daughter Frances. Frances is buried so deep in isolated mourning for her dead husband that her mother fears for both her and for her grandson. Apparently the marriage between Frances and her husband was so intense that it nearly excluded the son in the first place, which Elspeth is still distressed about. Frances, a professional photographer, photographed the stages of her husband's deterioration, and her home is filled with images of him in varying degrees of health and increasing illness.  He haunts the house, his widow, his son, the film. Elspeth feels that by photographing this protracted death, Frances has also disappeared into a form of living death, and so she tries to take Frances out of herself  by coaxing her to join her in a long walk with her camera in hand.As irritating as Frances finds her mother's intrusion into her solitude, she also worries about her increasing weakness as she moves farther into old age. This irritation is expressed one minute when Frances covers her ears as Elspeth relates a long story, her concern revealed a few moments later when her mother's sudden silence sparks concern, and the turning off all the faucets and listening intently, calling anxiously for her mother until she begins to speak again. They bicker--both are witty, funny, acidic, and able to hit bulls-eye's every time they take aim, then share deeply loving moments, and later, as they walk together, Frances begins to see her mother as an individual, rather than the irritating fuss-budget she usually reduces her to. (An aside--this is the moment all mothers await--the dawning upon their daughters that they are not just ""Mother"" but an actual, whole person who exists in 3-d and is as complex and worthy of respect as her daughter is, and finally gets that respect from her daughter--many stories are about this subject alone so lost is the notion of respect for one's mother--and many mothers both in stories and in life wait a long time for this pivotal, life-changing moment.) It is wonderful to see that process unfold here. The issues of being needed and of needing are addressed directly, and it seems as though Elspeth has wanted to talk about the subject for some time, but has felt unable to do so because of Frances' emotional and physical distance (she and her son have been in Australia on extended holiday after her husband's death, and Elspeth has been afraid they'd not return). According to the interview on the DVD, Rickman commissioned the project when he was at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with the great actress Lindsay Duncan, whose mother was at that time suffering from the stage of Alzheimer's when one is both amusing and exasperating, and so he asked Lindsay and Sharman to talk and then Sharman wrote the play. We see in the film that combination of love and frustration between the mother and daughter, and how each has to make room for the changes in the relationship that occur when the mother begins to need the daughter, and the daughter has to come to terms with both that and her own need--however annoying it may be, one never quite stops needing one's mother.The second pair is Frances' son Alex (Gary Hollywood), and Nita (Arlene Cockburn), a neighborhood girl who has had an eye on him and who chooses today to take a shot at flirtation. She is a strong, self-sufficient young woman whose boyish looks have made her unsure of her femininity and subsequently rather belligerent in compensation. It is this combination of power and hidden vulnerability that draws Alex to her. From the house, Elspeth watches them through a telescope, looks into the girl's eager, open face and says, ""You be careful, Alex--it wants, that face--give her the moon, she'd want the stars as well..."" She then goes on to admit to herself that she always ""wanted"" and ""wants"" still, dispelling the myth that with age comes a sort of numbness to such normal things as desire. Alex, who is worried terribly about his mother and haunted by his father's death, is not at first very receptive to Nita's attempts at contact, but eventually succumbs to her teasing and flirting, and finally brings the girl home to the unexpectedly abandoned house. A poorly-timed confrontation with yet another photograph of his father breaks him down, and he is able to reveal the depth of his emotional turmoil, and for all Nita's previous indications of selfishness, she is able to receive and hold it, and some sort of healing begins for him.The third pair, an elderly couple of women--Lily and Chloe (played respectively by Sheila Reid and Sandra Voe)--who seem to have outlived all their friends and neighbors, spend their time in going to funerals, making a day's outing of each one, complete with tea and cakes.  It's not possible to describe here how their experience plays out with such depth and significance, but that it does is an example of how Alan Rickman has brought even this subtle piece of the story fully to life, making these women real and powerfully empathetic. When Chloe's crisis comes, we feel the strength of Lily's support and are moved.Our final pair is two young boys who have skipped school for the day. Sam (Douglas Murphy) and his best friend Tom (Sean Biggerstaff, later of the Harry Potter movies) are at that fragile age when boys are on the brink of manhood and struggling to understand who they are and how they fit. They are sweet and tender (a moment shared between Tom and the newly shorn Frances, when he asks to touch her short, prickly hair, is so filled with emotion it moves the hard-shelled Frances to tears), obnoxious and argumentative--all the things boys at about 12 are.  They are concerned with the problems of burgeoning sexuality, relationships with family members, their futures, and then, unexpectedly, with the lives of a couple of tiny, abandoned kittens whom they rescue and care for lovingly as they sit on the frozen shore, staring out onto the frozen sea. The above mentioned encounter between Frances and her mother and the momentariliy alone Tom is a wonderful one which reveals much about all three characters. All of the duos bump into one another at one time or another, some briefly, some with greater impact, but this one most of all.  It is impossible not to love these boys who,in that moment between boyhood and manhood, are as frozen as is the sea, and we want to hold them there, as safely as they hold their kittens, and not let them go into the uncertain future.It is not an accident that this day of days is one on which even the salt sea has freezed up. ""Once before I've seen the sea frozen, just the once, long, long ago,"" says Chloe to her friend, Lily. ""What a day that was."" I, too, spent a day with my sister long ago on the coast of New England when the sea had frozen, and indeed, what a day that was. There's something that stuns one when this always-moving, ever-changing, rising and falling tidal body of water suddenly becomes solid and fixed in time and space. The day feels incredibly significant, even if nothing in particular is happening, because normal laws of nature seem suspended--everything is heightened and magical. I still remember every moment of that day with my sister on the beach, speaking in hushed and awed voices, and that memory deepens my own understanding of why the writer made this story occur on such a day. The sea's stasis mirrors that of the psyches of each of the characters in the story, all of whom are frozen in some moment they cannot seem to get past. That they each have made some real movement by the end of the film is very much the point--this frozen day creates quiet crises in each character which they must overcome, and the writer helps them through this process by pairing each one up. They're helped through their frozen states into some beginning of action towards their futures by one another. But the future is misty, impossible to know; it requires walking with trust into the unknown, and Rickman illustrates this beautifully at the end in a way which I will not give away here. The introspective, contemplative mood is maintained throughout the final titles, which I would recommend sitting through in order to hear the beautiful voice of Elizabeth Fraser (Cocteau Twins) singing ""Take me With You.""""The Winter Guest"" is that rare thing--a beautiful, quiet, understated film that moves you, makes you feel both the joy and sadness that comes with being human, and most of all offers the great gifts of faith in friendship, trust, and in the power of love to transform life even when life is hard, when you're stuck in your own personal mess with no visible way out, and need another to take your arm, hold you up and see you through, and are wise enough to realize it. I cannot recommend it enough.",5,"An extraordinary debut by director Alan Rickman--gorgeous, beautifully acted, unique",1125532800,"09 1, 2005",2005,12429,"['Winter', 'Guest', 'Alan', 'Rickman',
