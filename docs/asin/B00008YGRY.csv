750035,A2QJC8A2HN5FWW,B00008YGRY,718 Session,"[12, 16]","Somebody needs to stick up for this season, and I think I'm the guy to do it:When Duchovney left the show, Chris Carter went back to the drawing board and gave us a revitalized X-Files, one that surpassed the foundering seen in the seventh season.  While I believe Scully's pregnancy hampered things in some ways, Scully and Doggett really clicked.It is an oversimplification to call Scully ""The Believer"" and Doggett ""The Skeptic"".  It would probably be more accurate to say that Doggett was a straightforward FBI guy--introducing themselves to the Boston Police: SCULLY: ""I'm a special agent with a medical background and expertise"" DOGGETT: ""I'm a good shot.""  Some of these episodes were the best on the show.  The cast change brought a real freshness to the episodes.After the apocalyptic season 7, Doggett really grounds the series in its paranoid and subversive roots (ex: that monsters are real, but fall under ""plausible deniability""), without re-hashing old script plots and ideas.  Let's face it: after six years Scully's skeptisim was *really* wearing thin (how many times can one person get kidnapped by aliens before they begin to think that maybe the aliens exist?)  Compare this season with Season 2 and you'll see what I mean.While Mulder's character, the search for his sister, and his fight against ""The consortium"" may have been the driving force behind the show, there was no reason the story couldn't continue.  Especially since most of those stories were wrapped up in Seasons 5-7.  While  Scully had her own passions and ambitions, and the antoginists still existed.  There is a natural flow to the idea of Mulder disappearing and Scully carrying on the X-Files torch in her own way.And while Reyes was a character who I found to be pretty annoying, she *did* add a lot to the show.  She would have done better, though, if the writers could have fleshed her ""feelings"" out a little bit more so that she wasn't ""feeling"" her way right through investigations to the smoknig guns a la Counseller Troi.In my mind, this season (and a few episodes from Season 9) make up ""The X-Files: The Next Generation"".  Had Chris Carter not been under so much pressure from Fox and the fan base, it is likely that this show would be still be on the air today (and would probably be better than half the stuff out there now).  But the uncertainty of the shows future combined with what seems to be impaitence from the suits really weighed down the X-Files.  Season 9 became the ""Wrap It Up And Get Us Out Of Here"" season with some truly awful episodes.If you didn't stop at Season Six, don't stop now.",4,X-Files: The Next Generation,1051488000,"04 28, 2003",2003,2606,"['Somebody', 'stick', 'up', 'season', 'think', ""'m"", 'guy', 'do', 'When', 'Duchovney', 'left', 'show', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'went', 'back', 'drawing', 'board', 'gave', 'revitalized', 'X-Files', 'one', 'surpassed', 'foundering', 'seen', 'seventh', 'season', 'believe', 'Scully', 'pregnancy', 'hampered', 'things', 'ways', 'Scully', 'Doggett', 'really', 'oversimplification', 'call', 'Scully', 'Believer', 'Doggett', 'Skeptic', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', 'say', 'Doggett', 'was', 'straightforward', 'FBI', 'guy', 'introducing', 'Boston', 'Police', 'SCULLY', ""'m"", 'special', 'agent', 'medical', 'background', 'expertise', 'DOGGETT', ""'m"", 'good', 'shot', 'episodes', 'were', 'best', 'show', 'cast', 'change', 'brought', 'real', 'freshness', 'episodes.After', 'apocalyptic', 'season', '7', 'Doggett', 'really', 'series', 'paranoid', 'subversive', 'roots', 'ex', 'monsters', 'are', 'real', 'fall', 'plausible', 'deniability', 're-hashing', 'old', 'script', 'plots', 'ideas', 'Let', 'face', 'six', 'years', 'Scully', 'skeptisim', 'was', '*really*', 'wearing', 'thin', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'can', 'one', 'person', 'get', 'kidnapped', 'aliens', 'begin', 'think', 'maybe', 'aliens', 'exist', 'Compare', 'season', 'Season', '2', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'mean.While', 'Mulder', 'character', 'search', 'sister', 'fight', 'consortium', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'driving', 'force', 'show', 'was', 'reason', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'continue', 'Especially', 'most', 'stories', 'were', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Seasons', '5-7', 'Scully', 'had', 'own', 'passions', 'ambitions', 'antoginists', 'still', 'existed', 'natural', 'flow', 'idea', 'Mulder', 'disappearing', 'Scully', 'carrying', 'X-Files', 'torch', 'own', 'way.And', 'Reyes', 'was', 'character', 'who', 'found', 'be', 'pretty', 'annoying', '*did*', 'add', 'lot', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'though', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'fleshed', 'feelings', 'out', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'so', 'was', ""n't"", 'feeling', 'way', 'right', 'investigations', 'smoknig', 'la', 'Counseller', 'Troi.In', 'mind', 'season', 'few', 'episodes', 'Season', '9', 'make', 'up', 'X-Files', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Had', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'pressure', 'Fox', 'fan', 'base', 'likely', 'show', 'would', 'be', 'still', 'be', 'air', 'today', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'stuff', 'there', 'now', 'uncertainty', 'shows', 'future', 'combined', 'what', 'be', 'impaitence', 'suits', 'really', 'weighed', 'X-Files', 'Season', '9', 'became', 'Wrap', 'Up', 'Get', 'Us', 'Out', 'Here', 'season', 'truly', 'awful', 'episodes.If', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'Season', 'Six', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'now']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season

The introduction of agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) was supposed to be the series' 'new blood'. Has it worked? Yes and no. Unfortunately, it's mostly no.The introduction of Agent Doggett was an attempt for a refreshing and grounding look at the whole alien conspiracy which got out of hand of reason in the past 2 - 3 seasons by having a fresh skeptic doubt the whole alien scheme to rule the Earth, etc. But it wasn't convincing. As for the stand alone episodes - nothing much was new, and a lot of the material felt recycled. Since Mulder wasn't around much, and Scully wasn't around a lot more than he was, their interaction was sorely missed.My advice: rent before buying.",3,Big changes in the series,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",2004,980,"['7', 'seasons', 'great', 'stand', 'alone', 'episodes', 'overly', 'complicated', 'mythology', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'wrapped', 'up', 'end', 'season', '7', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'minimizing', 'role', 'series', 'had', 'change', 'got', 'too', 'boring', 'even', 'die', 'hard', 'fans', 'introduction', 'agent', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'agent', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'series', 'blood', 'worked', 'Yes', 'Unfortunately', 'mostly', 'no.The', 'introduction', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'was', 'attempt', 'refreshing', 'grounding', 'look', 'whole', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'got', 'hand', 'reason', 'past', '2', '3', 'seasons', 'having', 'fresh', 'skeptic', 'doubt', 'whole', 'alien', 'scheme', 'rule', 'Earth', 'etc', 'was', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'stand', 'alone', 'nothing', 'much', 'was', 'new', 'lot', 'material', 'felt', 'recycled', 'Mulder', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'much', 'Scully', 'was', ""n't"", 'lot', 'more', 'was', 'interaction', 'was', 'sorely', 'missed.My', 'advice', 'rent', 'buying']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season

By introducing John Doggett the show feels like it's getting a breath of fresh air, but then, it is Chris Carter we are talking about, people, with him good things can only last so long.PROS:No bored-out Duchovny (like he was during the two previous years), a reinvigorated Gillian Anderson, Robert Patrick's John Doggett, most of the first half season episodes.CONS:That the show getting better was an illusion, as soon as Mulder returns (gasp! spoiler) things get weird. And before that no one really seems to care to look for him while he's missing. Writters had a mess with Scully's pregnancy timeline, etc. Oh, right and they kill what could have been the main villian of the show if handled correctly.Bottom Line: Has good stand-alone episodes, and Within/Without are nice mythology installments.

I hear so many people whine and complain, but overall i think this is one of the best seasons they had.Reason 1: Robert Patrick as Special Agent John Doggett.Reason 2: Annabeth Gish as Special Agent Monica ReyesReason 3: Drama, suspense, action, and excelent storytellingThe SA John Doggett character, along with a glimbse of things to come with SA Reyes kept you watching.  The Agent Harrison character, named after a fan of the show who died of cancer ( i think) was airheaded but hopefully will get a cameo in season nine, I haven't seen it yet by thew way, don't spoil it for me!The stories were well written, I like Skinner being more involved.  Obviously as a long time fan it's nice to see Mulder and Scully involved FINALLY.  And the search for mulder made me keep comming back.  This was one kick ass season.Yeah some questions were left unanswered...but isn't that the point of the entire series????Basiclly, get over it.  If you are a fan you will like at least something about it.

It helped bring the show back to its dark roots.  The episodes are reminiscent of the earlier seasons.  Of course the difference lies in the absence of Fox Mulder.  Gillian Anderson's performance throughout this season was stellar.  She was at the top of her form.  I also enjoyed the musical score, that song that came on whenever Scully's loneliness and Mulder's disappearance were the focus.  ""We Are Near"" I think the song is called.  I believe Chris Carter explained that in the extras.  Anyway, there's not a single episode I can point out as low quality or just plain bad.  The return of Fox Mulder was pretty dramatic but a little far-fetched, considering how it was all played out what with Mulder being dead and then coming back to life.  That was weird.  Otherwise...I don't think the show should've ended at Season 8 because there were still so many unanswered questions, especially regarding Mulder's fate in the FBI and with those in the Bureau who would've liked to see him and the X-Files go down.  Getting to the point, buy this if you don't mind that Mulder's gone for half a season.

Premiering in the Fall of 1993 on the Fox Network, home of popular programs such as The Simpsons (1989) and King Of The Hill (1997), The X-Files created an entire fictional world of conspiracies and secret organizations, building a legion of fanatic followers as devoted to the series as Trekkies are to Star Trek. Creator Cris Carter, a former writer for numerous TV shows in the late-80s/early-90s - The Nanny (1993) is one example - brings together the finest aspects of suspense-laden spy novels and alien science fiction. The result is one of the top sci-fi franchises ever produced, spawning its own line of merchandise and even a full length feature film - The X-Files: Fight The Future (1998). With nine successful seasons to its credit, The X-Files is one of the longest-running sci-fi series in television history...The X-Files follows the exploits of four FBI agents assigned to investigate a series of unsolved and mysterious cases known only as ""The X-Files"". FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) are the primary agents investigating these unusual cases which could never be solved by conventional investigatory methods. But Mulder and Scully in particular play prominent roles in the series. The partnership and friendship the two develop during the course of the series sets the tone for their investigations into the paranormal with Scully, a medical doctor, playing the skeptic to Mulder's deeply held beliefs in widespread government conspiracies and alien abductions. Through the course of the series, The X-Files covers a wide-range of frightening and mysterious subjects from killer insects and secret world government organizations to the colonization of Earth by parasitic aliens. In so doing, it adds its own unique brand of humor and an original blend of creativity that fans of the genre will certainly appreciate...The X-Files (Season 8) DVD features a number of suspense riddled episodes including the season premiere ""Within"" in which recently appointed Deputy Director Kersh organizes a team, headed by Agent Doggett, to search for and arrest Mulder. He warns Skinner and Scully to stay silent in regard to the alien conspiracy theories, while the two agents deduce that the alien bounty hunter is slowly killing off subjects of the alien abductions. When Doggett reaches the same conclusion, the three follow a trail that leads them right to Mulder... Other notable episodes from Season 8 include ""Redrum"" in which a man awakes to find he is being charged for his wife's murder despite his inability to remember what has happened, and ""Vienen"" in which Mulder and Doggett work together in an effort to uncover the truth behind a series of deaths onboard an offshore oil rig...Below is a list of episodes included on The X-Files (Season 8) DVD:Episode 162 (Within)Episode 163 (Without)Episode 164 (Patience)Episode 165 (Roadrunners)Episode 166 (Invocation)Episode 167 (Redrum)Episode 168 (Via Negativa)Episode 169 (Surekill)Episode 170 (Salvage)Episode 171 (Badlaa)Episode 172 (The Gift)Episode 173 (Medusa)Episode 174 (Per Manum)Episode 175 (This is Not Happening)Episode 176 (Dead Alive)Episode 177 (Three Words)Episode 178 (Empedocles)Episode 179 (Vienen)Episode 180 (Alone)Episode 181 (Essence)Episode 182 (Existence)The DVD Report",4,A unique and original TV drama series...,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,3535,"['Nominated', '12', 'Golden', 'Globes', '61', 'Emmys', 'including', '4', 'Outstanding', 'Drama', 'Series', 'X-Files', 'one', 'world', 'most', 'popular', 'science-fiction', 'drama', 'Premiering', 'Fall', '1993', 'Fox', 'Network', 'home', 'popular', 'programs', 'such', 'Simpsons', '1989', 'King', 'Hill', '1997', 'X-Files', 'created', 'entire', 'fictional', 'world', 'conspiracies', 'secret', 'organizations', 'building', 'legion', 'fanatic', 'followers', 'devoted', 'series', 'Trekkies', 'are', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Creator', 'Cris', 'Carter', 'former', 'writer', 'numerous', 'TV', 'shows', 'late-80s/early-90s', 'Nanny', '1993', 'one', 'example', 'together', 'finest', 'aspects', 'suspense-laden', 'spy', 'novels', 'alien', 'science', 'fiction', 'result', 'one', 'top', 'sci-fi', 'franchises', 'ever', 'produced', 'spawning', 'own', 'line', 'merchandise', 'even', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'X-Files', 'Fight', 'Future', '1998', 'nine', 'successful', 'seasons', 'credit', 'X-Files', 'one', 'longest-running', 'sci-fi', 'series', 'television', 'history', 'X-Files', 'exploits', 'four', 'FBI', 'agents', 'assigned', 'investigate', 'series', 'unsolved', 'mysterious', 'cases', 'known', 'only', 'X-Files', 'FBI', 'special', 'agents', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'are', 'primary', 'agents', 'investigating', 'unusual', 'cases', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'solved', 'conventional', 'investigatory', 'methods', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'particular', 'play', 'prominent', 'roles', 'series', 'partnership', 'friendship', 'two', 'develop', 'course', 'series', 'tone', 'investigations', 'paranormal', 'Scully', 'medical', 'doctor', 'playing', 'skeptic', 'Mulder', 'deeply', 'held', 'beliefs', 'widespread', 'government', 'conspiracies', 'alien', 'abductions', 'course', 'series', 'X-Files', 'wide-range', 'frightening', 'mysterious', 'subjects', 'killer', 'insects', 'secret', 'world', 'government', 'organizations', 'colonization', 'Earth', 'parasitic', 'aliens', 'so', 'doing', 'own', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'original', 'blend', 'creativity', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'X-Files', 'Season', '8', 'DVD', 'number', 'suspense', 'riddled', 'episodes', 'including', 'season', 'premiere', 'Within', 'recently', 'appointed', 'Deputy', 'Director', 'Kersh', 'team', 'headed', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'search', 'arrest', 'Mulder', 'Skinner', 'Scully', 'stay', 'silent', 'regard', 'alien', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'two', 'agents', 'deduce', 'alien', 'bounty', 'hunter', 'slowly', 'killing', 'off', 'subjects', 'alien', 'abductions', 'When', 'Doggett', 'same', 'conclusion', 'three', 'follow', 'trail', 'right', 'Mulder', 'Other', 'notable', 'episodes', 'Season', '8', 'include', 'Redrum', 'man', 'find', 'being', 'charged', 'wife', 'murder', 'inability', 'remember', 'what', 'happened', 'Vienen', 'Mulder', 'Doggett', 'work', 'together', 'effort', 'uncover', 'truth', 'series', 'deaths', 'offshore', 'oil', 'rig', 'Below', 'list', 'episodes', 'included', 'X-Files', 'Season', '8', 'DVD', 'Episode', '162', 'Within', 'Episode', '163', 'Episode', '164', 'Patience', 'Episode', '165', 'Roadrunners', 'Episode', '166', 'Invocation', 'Episode', '167', 'Redrum', 'Episode', '168', 'Via', 'Negativa', 'Episode', '169', 'Surekill', 'Episode', '170', 'Salvage', 'Episode', '171', 'Badlaa', 'Episode', '172', 'Gift', 'Episode', '173', 'Medusa', 'Episode', '174', 'Per', 'Manum', 'Episode', '175', 'Not', 'Happening', 'Episode', '176', 'Dead', 'Alive', 'Episode', '177', 'Three', 'Words', 'Episode', '178', 'Empedocles', 'Episode', '179', 'Vienen', 'Episode', '180', 'Alone', 'Episode', '181', 'Essence', 'Episode', '182', 'Existence', 'DVD', 'Report']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season
750043,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B00008YGRY,Busy Body,"[8, 9]","I am a huge fan of The X-Files, and I widely consider it to be amongst one of the greatest TV shows ever created. All the fans know the supposed demise of the show after its first seven seasons. Apparently, Mulder and Scully can only work together. They were considered the nuts and bolts, and even the bloody glue that held the show together. I thought I agreed, until about a week ago when I watched Season 8 again.I was a latecomer to the show, and Season 7 was the first season I watched in full when it was broadcast in the UK at the start of 2000. Therefore, I didn't have as much nostalgic memories about the previous six seasons with Mulder and Scully, so a drastic change such as the departure of Mulder in Season 8 didn't seem like such a big deal to me. Okay, the show is definitely better with both Mulder and Scully in because they are just two parts of a whole. They fit together and have an on-screen chemistry that runs Buffy and Angel's into the ground! But some people were so obsessed with this pairing that once they knew Mulder wouldn't be in the large majority of Season 8, they refused to even watch it, calling it terrible and boring! Those people will never change their minds on the last two seasons of this show, which I think is a great shame because this is actually one of the strongest seasons of the show.I originally believed all the haters of Season 8 and approached it with much caution. Did I really want to be watching these episodes, one after another only to be let down every time? There was only one way to found out, and that was by watching the bloody things! What I found surprised me because, yes, for a little while I was noticing the absence of David Duchovny, but I soon forgot about it, because what stands in his place are some really superb stand-alone episodes. The writers and producers of the show knew that they had to write some amazing stand-alones to make this a good season without Mulder. Gillian Anderson is as her best in Season 8 out of all these seasons. She conveys such a tremendous variety of raw emotions. The arrival of Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett was the reason a lot of people disliked this season, but over the episodes here you grow to love him. He's a great character, that's all there is to it. The addition of Monica Reyes later in the season was also what some people considered the final blow to the show, but I disagree. She's nothing like Scully. She's a bit of an airhead, and you learn to love her caring character, especially in the finale.The mythology of Season 8 is one of my favourites, and it is certainly much stronger than it was in Seasons 6 and 7, and possibly even Season 5. With Scully revealing her pregnancy and Mulder abducted in the Season 7 finale, the two-part opener of Season 8, ""Within/Without,"" is a stunning search for Mulder in the middle of the desert. It's also two episodes where Scully and Doggett are forced to work together and their conflicting opinions come to a head. After ten stand-alone episodes, we are treated to four back-to-back mythology episodes. The first is ""Per Manum,"" which focuses on Scully's pregnancy and the fact that a dangerous organisation could be killing mothers of babies once they have just been born, to hide something about the experimentation of alien DNA on human ova.""This Is Not Happening"" sees the returm of Jeremiah Smith who had the power to heal any injured people no matter what their condition in the Season 3 finale. In this episode, he is healing alien abductees who have been returned to Earth, but there's a darker secret at work. This episode also sees the return of Mulder, but who is dead on arrival. ""Deadalive"" is the next episode, where Mulder is buried, but dug up again and found to actually be alive. With the help of a cure, Mulder is fully restored to life. This episode also sees the return of one Billy Miles from the first-ever episode of the show, which shows just how wrong the rebirth of an abductee can go if not treated with a cure.""Three Words"" is an action-packed mythology episode which sees Mulder breaking into a high-security government facility to extract information about his abduction, and other secrets. It's also a great episode which deals with the tension between Mulder and Doggett as they come to blows over Scully. The next stand-alone is the superb ""Vienen,"" which deals with the reappearance of the black oil on an oil rig offshore of New Mexico. The focus in this episode is how the oil is being killed off inside its host. Radiation is ruled out, as the oil itself has elements of radioactive qualities to it. Mulder and Doggett work together on the rig, against Deputy Director Kirsch's orders (and against each other to begin with) but ultimately strike up a great partnership in which they are able to discover the extend of devastation on the rig.""Essence"" is the second to last episode of the season and is a fantastic one which deals with Scully's pregnancy. Her baby is thought to be in danger from a group of people intent on stealing the baby. They fear that it could be the ultimate human being, because of how Scully's ova were experimented on. This is continued in the season finale, ""Existence,"" where Scully and Reyes are forced to go into hiding hundreds of miles from home to escape Billy Miles who is now a super-human machine intent on destroying everything in his path to get at the baby. This episode is one of the most action-packed of the entire scene, includes some shocking twists, and includes a high-speed car park chase mixed with Scully's pregnancy as the people who want to take her child watch on. A superb ending.As I said before, the stand-alone episodes of Season 8 are truly exceptional. The first is ""Patience,"" in which Scully and Doggett investigate a bat-like creature that is attacking people in remote areas of woodland. ""Roadrunners"" is one of the most shocking and disturbing episodes of the show's entire nine-year run! Scully stumbles amongst a community of strange people who live out in the middle of the desert, away from civilisation. They worship this massive slug-like creature, which they implant in people. It then takes home on their spines and lives there, before ultimately destroying its victims. These people are obviously very deranged, and the way they trick Scully into staying with them so they can implant the slug is just so freaky! This episode made me scream and cringe!""Invocation"" is a very scary episode which focuses on a young boy who goes missing in 1990. Ten years later he is found again. He should be 17 years old, but he's still the same age he was when he went missing. His mother doesn't care because she's just got her pride and joy back, but strange things start happening. ""Redrum"" is a great episode which focuses on a man who is suspected of killing his wife. However, time begins to travel backwards for him until he can predict how and where his wife will die, so he can hopefully prevent it from happening. ""Via Negativa"" is a superb episode which should have fallen flat on its face, due to the lack of both Mulder and Scully. However, Robert Patrick put on a stunning performance in this episode about the fine line between illusion and reality in our dreams. ""Surekill"" is a bit of a boring episode in which two brothers can see through walls to fulfil their desires. They shoot drug-dealers from behind walls, then steal all their money.""Salvage"" is another rather boring episode, but I think it has a great and original storyline. A man was used as a test subject with metal in a terrible experiment gone wrong. He sets out to exact his revenge. He is extremely strong, obviously, being made of metal. He can wrap a car around himself when it's travelling at 40mph towards him and has the power to punch holes through 4 inch-thick steel doors. ""Badlaa"" was one of my favourite episodes of the season in which a small Indian man takes host in the stomachs of people, ultimately killing them, but getting to live their lives through his eyes. ""The Gift"" is a bit of a poor episode in which Doggett investigates a man/beast creature which has the power to cure illnesses. This episode also reveals that Mulder had an incurable brain disease because he visited the creature some time at the start of Season 7.""Medusa"" is another great episode where Doggett and Scully investigate a strange new chemical which is living in a train tunnel and eats away at the flesh of its victims. It's a truly horrifying episode, but fascinating nonetheless. ""Empedocles"" is a good episode which deals with a man who can't help killing people. He has visions of the victims as being totally burnt. Reyes sees this also and links this back to a case she investigated earlier in her career with Doggett when he son went missing. ""Alone"" is a great episode where Scully is sent on maternity leave. Doggett is assigned a new partner, a certain Miss Harrison. She's a bit obsessed with Mulder and Scully's past exploits, and let's her imagination run away with her. I was worried she was yet another addition to the show, but thankfully this is the only episode she appears in. Together, they investigate a creature which blinds its victims with a spray, before devouring them. Mulder is also excellent in this episode.All in all I found Season 8 to be a great season of The X-Files. People don't like change, which is why the Mulder-lovers hated this season. Don't get me wrong, I love Mulder as much as the next guy (he's bloody gorgeous!) but by the end of Season 7, the show was in desperate need of a revamp. The new characters in John Doggett and Monica Reyes provide this. FOX was providing the show with a $4 million an episode budget, which is a lot of money, but I think it was well spent because some of the sets in this season are very beautiful. A lot of people say that Chris Carter didn't want to let go of his multi-million dollar creation, but would you? I know I wouldn't. If you disliked this season, watch it again. You might find yourself surprised.",5,So Very Underrated,1111795200,"03 26, 2005",2005,10039,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'X-Files', 'widely', 'consider', 'be', 'amongst', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows',

750046,AR3RAD2DPXBRN,B00008YGRY,Christopher Farrell,"[25, 36]","Well, actually I don't know. I don't watch a lot of other TV.For me, the infuriating thing about Seasons 8 and 9 is how close things came to working out, how nearly the X-Files came to transitioning from Mulder/Scully to Dogget/Reyes and perhaps keeping the franchise alive for another 7 years to the delight of fans, but it was not to be. What went wrong?People have said that Mulder & Scully were so central to the X-Files, it couldn't survive without them. I don't actually believe this; I subscribe to the holistic view that it was a combination of the writing, acting, characters, production, and above all, subtelty and attention to detail. We could have lost Mulder & Scully, but with Skinner, The Lone Gunmen, CSM, Krycek, and so on, and with the same quality of writing as in seasons 4-6, the show could have gone on.One problem was Dogget & Reyes' more extreme characters. Dogget is more of a knee-jerk skeptic, while Reyes is an unquestioning believer. One of the key reasons Mulder & Scully worked so well is that they worked in different shades rather than completely different attittudes. Mulder always bought into the science thing, and always tried to prove his theories to Scully in her scientific terms. Scully was willing to believe when the evidence was presented and the theory sound. Reyes and Dogget didn't have this common ground when first introduced and were much more two-dimensional.It didn't then help that the rest of the elements slipped. The writing is far less sharp or consistant than previous years. The dialog and plotting lacks subtelty. The series lacks the wonder, the joy of the unknown that made previous years so appealing. They're still good at the scary stuff, but for me anyway the scary stuff was always just one piece of the puzzle.What for me was disappointing was to look at the last few episodes of Season 9, when Dogget and Reyes finally start to gel, finally are starting to look like they might carry the show, the writing finally starting to tighten up again, and some of the subtelty is returning. Mulder and Scully are finally being left in the rear-view mirror and the show is getting on with it's life ... but too late.A lot of little things went wrong this year for the X-Files, and it took too long for things to right themselves. It could have been done - if, for example, Scully had simply been sidelined instead of being put through the torturous (and, quite frankly, not particularly plausible) gyrations of Season 8, perhaps they could have had a clean slate and gotten back to where they needed to be (hey, I love Scully too, one of my favorite characters ... but sometimes you have to do things you don't want to). Perhaps if they had focussed more on Dogget and Reyes right away, bringing those characters more into focus, things would have been better.But, it was not to be. Season 8 is still far from bad, but it isn't as good as any previous season, even Season 7 (which while it lacked consistancy, and had more klunkers than ever before, at least also had more stand-out episodes). I don't think it's even as good as the short-lived and lamented The Lone Gunmen, which had issues but was entertaining and I would have rather seen that show survive than the X-Files at that point. Season 8 still has some of the great visuals we've come to expect, but it's a transition season. If we knew that the X-Files was transitioning *to* somewhere, that would be OK, but we now know it retrospect that it's not, Season 9 is the end of the line.So anyway. I'll be buying because I love the X-Files, and I'm a completist. That being said, I'm not thrilled about the money I'll have to spend, nor do I recommend this season with much enthusiasm. I think long-time X-Files fans will want this for their collection, but I doubt I'll be going back to watch these episodes as often as other seasons, as there are no true classics here to match ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"", ""Kill Switch"", ""Jose Chung"", ""Gethsemene"", ""Squeeze"", ""Die Hand der Verlitzt"", ""Three of a Kind"" and so on.",3,The X-Files becomes slightly above average,1064188800,"09 22, 2003",2003,4037,"['Well', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'lot', 'other', 'TV.For', 'infuriating', 'thing', 'Seasons', '8', '9', 'how', 'close', 'things', 'came', 'working', 'out', 'how', 'nearly', 'X-Files', 'came', 'transitioning', 'Mulder/Scully', 'Dogget/Reyes', 'perhaps', 'keeping', 'franchise', 'alive', '7', 'years', 'delight', 'fans', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'People', 'have', 'said', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'were', 'so', 'central', 'X-Files', 'could', ""n't"", 'survive', 'do', ""n't"", 'actually', 'believe', 'subscribe', 'holistic', 'view', 'was', 'combination', 'writing', 'acting', 'characters', 'production', 'subtelty', 'attention', 'detail', 'could', 'have', 'lost', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Skinner', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'CSM', 'Krycek', 'so', 'same', 'quality', 'writing', 'seasons', '4-6', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'on.One', 'problem', 'was', 'Dogget', 'Reyes', 'more', 'extreme', 'characters', 'Dogget', 'more', 'knee-jerk', 'skeptic', 'Reyes', 'unquestioning', 'believer', 'One', 'key', 'reasons', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'worked', 'different', 'shades', 'rather', 'completely', 'different', 'attittudes', 'Mulder', 'always', 'bought', 'science', 'thing', 'always', 'tried', 'prove', 'theories', 'Scully', 'scientific', 'terms', 'Scully', 'was', 'willing', 'believe', 'when', 'evidence', 'was', 'presented', 'theory', 'sound', 'Reyes', 'Dogget', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'common', 'ground', 'when', 'first', 'introduced', 'were', 'much', 'more', 'two-dimensional.It', 'did', ""n't"", 'then', 'help', 'rest', 'elements', 'slipped', 'writing', 'far', 'less', 'sharp', 'consistant', 'previous', 'years', 'dialog', 'plotting', 'lacks', 'subtelty', 'series', 'wonder', 'joy', 'unknown', 'made', 'previous', 'years', 'so', 'appealing', ""'re"", 'still', 'good', 'scary', 'stuff', 'anyway', 'scary', 'stuff', 'was', 'always', 'just', 'one', 'piece', 'puzzle.What', 'was', 'disappointing', 'was', 'look', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'Season', '9', 'when', 'Dogget', 'Reyes', 'finally', 'start', 'gel', 'finally', 'are', 'starting', 'look', 'might', 'carry', 'show', 'writing', 'finally', 'starting', 'tighten', 'up', 'again', 'subtelty', 'returning', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'are', 'finally', 'being', 'left', 'rear-view', 'mirror', 'show', 'getting', 'life', 'too', 'late.A', 'lot', 'little', 'things', 'went', 'wrong', 'year', 'X-Files', 'took', 'too', 'long', 'things', 'right', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'example', 'Scully', 'had', 'simply', 'been', 'sidelined', 'instead', 'being', 'put', 'torturous', 'quite', 'frankly', 'not', 'particularly', 'plausible', 'gyrations', 'Season', '8', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'clean', 'slate', 'gotten', 'back', 'where', 'needed', 'be', 'hey', 'love', 'Scully', 'too', 'one', 'favorite', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'have', 'do', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'Perhaps', 'had', 'focussed', 'more', 'Dogget', 'Reyes', 'right', 'away', 'bringing', 'characters', 'more', 'focus', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better.But', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'Season', '8', 'still', 'far', 'bad', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'season', 'even', 'Season', '7', 'lacked', 'consistancy', 'had', 'more', 'klunkers', 'ever', 'least', 'also', 'had', 'more', 'stand-out', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'even', 'as', 'good', 'short-lived', 'lamented', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'had', 'issues', 'was', 'entertaining', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'show', 'survive', 'X-Files', 'point', 'Season', '8', 'still', 'great', 'visuals', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'transition', 'season', 'knew', 'X-Files', 'was', 'transitioning', '*to*', 'somewhere', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'now', 'know', 'not', 'Season', '9', 'end', 'line.So', 'anyway', ""'ll"", 'be', 'buying', 'love', 'X-Files', ""'m"", 'completist', 'being', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'thrilled', 'money', ""'ll"", 'have', 'spend', 'do', 'recommend', 'season', 'much', 'enthusiasm', 'think', 'long-time', 'X-Files', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'collection', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'going', 'back', 'watch', 'episodes', 'as', 'often', 'other', 'seasons', 'are', 'true', 'classics', 'here', 'match', 'Post-Modern', 'Prometheus', 'Kill', 'Switch', 'Jose', 'Chung', 'Gethsemene', 'Squeeze', 'Die', 'Hand', 'der', 'Verlitzt', 'Three', 'Kind', 'so']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season
750047,A8MOBUTMII8OM,B00008YGRY,Christopher,"[3, 5]","I discovered the X-Files my freshman year of high school and it only took a few more episodes before I found myself hooked. Over the course of the next 9 years I watched only one show on television, not caring to involve myself in any other story but those involving Mulder and Scully. When I heard of the departure of David Duchovny I was naturally disappointed, having enjoyed the development of his character over the last 7 years. When the premiere of Season 8 first aired I had no idea what to expect, and from the very first moments on that Sunday night I knew that something unique was going to happen. Season 8 breathed a new life into a series that could well have ended like so many shows with such tenure. Every new show felt fresh and was as if the creative force behind the X-Files had rediscovered that which frightened them the most. I was enthralled with nearly every episode and even more so with the reappearance of characters I had enjoyed from the beginning. Never had felt such anticipation for each Sunday night, not since I first saw &quot;Anasazi&quot; and felt the shock of realizing I would have to wait an entire summer to learn Mulder's fate. I watched the Season finale realizing that this could possibly be the end of the series forever, and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the entire show. The shocking end of Alex Krycek and the most satisfying conclusion to an X-Files episode I had ever witnessed, Season 8 was something to remember. As luck would have it the show was not over yet, and fans were given one more chance to experience the web of dark tales and conspiracies brought to life by Chris Carter and his brilliant cast.

750048,AMVMEHGE80PSI,B00008YGRY,"Christopher Loring Knowles ""secretsun.blogspo...","[9, 9]","The controversial eighth season of the X Files is remarkable in many ways. First of all, it's the only season in the series that doesn't have any real clunkers. But it also has a lot of merely solid episodes, ones that harken back to the earlier, more straight-forward sci-fi/horror stories. But on the other hand, it has some of the all time greatest episodes in the entire history of the program.What distinguishes season 8 from other X Files seasons, besides the presence of new male lead Robert Patrick, is that was the first season since the fifth in which Chris Carter's attention was focused on the X Files itself. Season 4 and 6 he was working on Millenium, 7 he was working on the short-lived Harsh Realm (he didn't spend much time on the Lone Gunmen, which was more of a Frank Spotnitz/Vince Gilligan show). I always resented these other shows and saw them as unnecessary diversions on Carter's part, even though I've come to appreciate Millennium. There were a lot of great writers and directors that worked on the X Files- Glen Morgan and  James Wong, Darin Morgan, Vince Gilligan, Frank Spotnitz- and many of them had better batting averages in regards to consistency. But none of them had the sheer madness, rage and intensity that Chris Carter made his calling card. Chris Carter's stories are distinguished by moments of extreme violence, bizarre, almost dream-like imagery, sharp twists in dialogue, and stomach-punching emotionalism. Seasoned X Files viewers can tell the difference between a Carter script and a Carter/Spotnitz script, and season 8 gives you 5 Carter solo pieces, more than any since the first season.Season Eight also has the most developed and immediately accessible Mytharc episodes of the series as well. The storyline featuring Mulder's abduction, death and ressurrection as well as Scully's pregnancy is very focused, concise and emotionally powerful. Robert Patrick was an inspired choice for the new male lead (he was never meant to actually ""replace"" David Duchovny) and gives the peerless Gillian Anderson a run for her money, acting chops wise.Hence the episodes Within/Without, Per Manum, This Is Not Happening,  DeadAlive, Three Words, Essence and Existence rank up there with the very best of the X Files, and given the incredible scope and high production values they display, may very well be the best multi-episode arc in the show's long history. All these episodes are exciting and carthartic, are worth the price of the box set alone. These episodes form the equivalent of 4 feature length motion pictures and stand up beside anything Hollywood has to offer insofar as production quality and beat most recent features when it comes to acting.If those episodes are the five-star episodes, there are also several four star offerings. Roadrunners,  Invocation and  Via Negativa are three amazingly powerful episodes, that miss the five star mark only because they are so dark and intense that they need David Duchovny's natural lightness and black humor to give them a bit of balance. But all three episodes make good use of Agent Doggett's character, particularly Invocation. If you are a parent, Invocation will stay with you for a very long time. Empedocles is of the same stock as these episodes and is elevated by Duchovny's wit and charm. However it is not their equal, story-wise. Neither are another two other  Duchovny eps, Vienen and Alone.The rest are servicable and worth at least one viewing. However they suffer iin comparison to the others in the season, especially in comparison with the Myth Arc. It's impossible to construct a season of television around the absence of your lead, and the X Files cannot be faulted for telling other types of stories. Hence Redrum,Patience, Surekill, Salvage, The Gift, Badlaa, and Medusa are all well crafted and worth a watch, but feel inconsequential in context. Medusa is the worst of the lot, and seems a lot of huffing and puffing about nothing.But every season since the beginning was like that. In retrospect, it seems that the Mythology was the most substantial aspect of the series, especially when watched in sequence. As time goes by, the stand-alones seem less interesting and important to me. But they're still X Files episodes, which makes them better than most other shows on TV.",5,A mix of insanely great and very solid episodes,1140134400,"02 17, 2006",2006,4298,"['controversial', 'eighth', 'season', 'X', 'Files', 'remarkable', 'many', 'ways', 'First', 'all', 'only', 'season', 'series', ""n't"", 'have', 'real', 'clunkers', 'also', 'lot', 'merely', 'solid', 'episodes', 'ones', 'harken', 'back', 'earlier', 'more', 'straight-forward', 'sci-fi/horror', 'stories', 'other', 'hand', 'time', 'greatest', 'episodes', 'entire', 'history', 'program.What', 'season', '8', 'other', 'X', 'Files', 'seasons', 'presence', 'new', 'male', 'lead', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'fifth', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'attention', 'was', 'focused', 'X', 'Files', 'Season', '4', '6', 'was', 'working', 'Millenium', '7', 'was', 'working', 'short-lived', 'Harsh', 'Realm', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'was', 'more', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz/Vince', 'Gilligan', 'show', 'always', 'resented', 'other', 'shows', 'saw', 'unnecessary', 'diversions', 'Carter', 'part', 'even', ""'ve"", 'come', 'appreciate', 'Millennium', 'were', 'lot', 'great', 'writers', 'directors', 'worked', 'X', 'Files-', 'Glen', 'Morgan', 'James', 'Wong', 'Darin', 'Morgan', 'Vince', 'Gilligan', 'Frank', 'Spotnitz-', 'many', 'had', 'better', 'batting', 'averages', 'regards', 'consistency', 'none', 'had', 'sheer', 'madness', 'rage', 'intensity', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'made', 'calling', 'card', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'stories', 'are', 'distinguished', 'moments', 'extreme', 'violence', 'bizarre', 'almost', 'dream-like', 'imagery', 'sharp', 'twists', 'dialogue', 'stomach-punching', 'emotionalism', 'Seasoned', 'X', 'Files', 'viewers', 'can', 'tell', 'difference', 'Carter', 'script', 'Carter/Spotnitz', 'script', 'season', '8', '5', 'Carter', 'solo', 'pieces', 'more', 'first', 'season.Season', 'Eight', 'also', 'most', 'developed', 'immediately', 'accessible', 'Mytharc', 'episodes', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'storyline', 'featuring', 'Mulder', 'abduction', 'death', 'ressurrection', 'as', 'well', 'Scully', 'pregnancy', 'very', 'focused', 'concise', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'was', 'inspired', 'choice', 'new', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'actually', 'replace', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'peerless', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'run', 'money', 'acting', 'chops', 'episodes', 'Within/Without', 'Per', 'Manum', 'Not', 'Happening', 'DeadAlive', 'Three', 'Words', 'Essence', 'Existence', 'rank', 'up', 'there', 'very', 'best', 'X', 'Files', 'given', 'incredible', 'scope', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'display', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'best', 'multi-episode', 'arc', 'show', 'long', 'history', 'episodes', 'are', 'exciting', 'carthartic', 'are', 'price', 'box', 'set', 'alone', 'episodes', 'form', 'equivalent', '4', 'feature', 'length', 'motion', 'pictures', 'stand', 'up', 'beside', 'anything', 'Hollywood', 'offer', 'insofar', 'production', 'quality', 'beat', 'most', 'recent', 'features', 'when', 'acting.If', 'episodes', 'are', 'five-star', 'episodes', 'are', 'also', 'several', 'four', 'star', 'offerings', 'Roadrunners', 'Invocation', 'Via', 'Negativa', 'are', 'three', 'amazingly', 'powerful', 'episodes', 'miss', 'five', 'star', 'mark', 'only', 'are', 'so', 'dark', 'intense', 'need', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'natural', 'lightness', 'black', 'humor', 'give', 'bit', 'balance', 'three', 'episodes', 'make', 'good', 'use', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'character', 'particularly', 'Invocation', 'are', 'parent', 'Invocation', 'will', 'stay', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Empedocles', 'same', 'stock', 'episodes', 'elevated', 'Duchovny', 'wit', 'charm', 'However', 'not', 'equal', 'story-wise', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'Duchovny', 'eps', 'Vienen', 'Alone.The', 'rest', 'are', 'servicable', 'worth', 'least', 'one', 'viewing', 'However', 'suffer', 'iin', 'comparison', 'others', 'season', 'especially', 'comparison', 'Myth', 'Arc', 'impossible', 'construct', 'season', 'television', 'absence', 'lead', 'X', 'Files', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'faulted', 'telling', 'other', 'types', 'stories', 'Hence', 'Redrum', 'Patience', 'Surekill', 'Salvage', 'Gift', 'Badlaa', 'Medusa', 'are', 'well', 'crafted', 'watch', 'feel', 'inconsequential', 'context', 'Medusa', 'worst', 'lot', 'lot', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'about', 'nothing.But', 'season', 'beginning', 'was', 'retrospect', 'Mythology', 'was', 'most', 'substantial', 'aspect', 'series', 'especially', 'when', 'watched', 'sequence', 'time', 'stand-alones', 'seem', 'less', 'interesting', 'important', ""'re"", 'still', 'X', 'Files', 'episodes', 'better', 'most', 'other', 'shows', 'TV']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season

But what kept me watching was the search for Mulder.Robert Patrick as Agent Doggett comes into the picture, assigned to find Mulder. I really liked his character alot, and he's a better actor than Duchovny. But everyone knows Mulder's the top dog, since this show's been all about him from the beginning. But Doggett was a great character, and I feel he's unjustly maligned by some X-Fans. He really did a great job.I think people just automatically rejected him because he wasn't Mulder, and I think that's unfair. What a true viewer should look at is how well the show works as a whole with Doggett, and if he's a good character. In my opinion, the response to both is &quot;yes.&quot;Also, the conspiracy is taken to a whole new level again. We're introduced to the plot of the alien replacements/replicants/Super Soldiers. They come into play as the aliens' back up plan in case the syndicate failed in making the slave race alien-human hybrids. They failed in season 6, so the aliens took on the responsibility themselves with a new plan.The episodes were all great, and I liked where the mythology went in this season. Searching for Mulder was one of the best ideas the creative team behind The X-Files had, and I think too many fans took that for granted. However, I do feel that the show should've ended with this season and then conclude the alien mythology in a new movie.

750051,AE2KCASMQPMO,B00008YGRY,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[17, 22]","The X-Files has been off the air for almost a year now... yet, I don't think there is anything on TV replacing its quality or stating the kind of questions this show asked during nine years.The eighth season brought the gratest challenge for the series: David Duchovny decided to be only in ten episodes. So, without Mulder, the writers decided to create a new character: agent John Doggett. The greatest surprise of this season was not actually its mulderless side, but how surprisingly good the new character was. Robert Patrick plays John Doggett in a fantastic way: he is agressive, he believes only in what his background allows him to believe, but most importantly: he is the most loyal and devoted partner. A big leap from Mulder's dettachment (he has greater worries: a quest, a mission).In spite of the odd chronological development of the season (Scully's pregnancy period was 12 months!), it was great: I think it is one of my favorite ones along with the third and the fourth.The season opener two parter (Within/Without) shows Scully and Skinner trying to find Mulder, Kersh being promoted to Deputy Director (to whom Skinner will have to answer now), and a big operation on his part, which seems to point only to Mulder as an insane man, who made himself disappear to prove that his beliefs were true. So, Kersh gives this assignement to the most inadequate agent: Doggett. Short Mulder sightings point to Kersh being right (if we hadn't seen Requiem, of course), but as this great two parter advances, we discover that it is fact the bounty Hunter destroying evidence (which could be in Scully's computer and in Gibson Prayse's DNA). We get so many great things in these two episodes! The most interesting images are those of Mulder being tortured in a spacecraft. By the end of Without Scully receives the news that she has been assigned a new partner: John Doggett... whose investigation on Mulder's disappearance is not over yet.The season continues for several episodes steping aside from the Mulder's abduction arc. Patience is about a sort of Batman... but not the one from Gotham city, but from the most provincial enviroment... and, of course, this is an evil bat-man. It is a pretty good episode, and it has Scully trying to see the case through Mulder's perspective. Then comes one of the best standalone episodes of the series: Roadrunners is a disturbing, graphic and very well written episode, which has Scully trapped in a town populated by a cult that worships a worm-like creature. It is painfully inserted into a person's spine. Of course, Scully is considered by this cult to be the perfect host for this worm: Scully pleading for her baby's life is just disturbing. Of course, by the end, Scully learns to rely more on her new partner.Some less fortunate episodes follow this four-in-a-row glorious ones. Invocation is interesting only because we get to see there a bit more of background on Doggett, Salvage and Surekill have nothing special to them... but these three episodes are pretty much all the lame ones of the season.Via Negativa is one of those odd stories which ends in a dream-like fourth act, which is hunting, mesmerizing and beautifully achieved. Redrum is an episode center in a man who perceives time backwards, of course, Scully and Doggett have not much to do in this one, but it is interesting from the man's point of view (and it is one great performance). It has the viewer going to a murder, and it is like a crescendo that ends in yet another great fourth act. Badlaa seems to be just a normal episode, but it is great: a hindu with powers over perception is seeking revenge by killing people, and it runs paralell with Scully trying to perceive reality as if her eyes were not to trust: she wants to perceive through Mulder's eyes. Her tears by the end of the episode show what a great episode can come from a moster of the week story. Medusa has Doggett underground being Scully's eyes: it is a very good episode which advances with a good pace.Then, there are Per Manum, This is not happening, Dead alive and Three Words. Four mythology episodes. The first is about Scully's pregnancy: what is in her? Is it a normal baby or an alien? The second one continues the search for Mulder. It is the return of Jeremiah Smith and Theresa Hosse. The end of this chapter is greatly made: Scully running to find Mulder death, and then going back to Smith (who is the only one capable to bring Mulder back to life) and competing with a UFO, against the which we all know she can do nothing. In Dead Alive we get to see Billy Miles again. Mulder returns by the end of this episode after a very complex set of explanations, which can only be accepted by watching the episode, and not by reading a synopsis. The last episodes of the season are very good: in Vienen we get to see the black oil; in Empedocles, Dogget's background is more deeply shown; and Alone is the final standalone of the season and it is very good: it is meant as a tribute to us, fans.Finally, the only cliffhanger-less season finale of the series: Essence and Existence. It is Scully's moment to give birth to her child, but an army of the so-called Super soldiers seems to be after her. These are two action packed episodes that end with the most elaborate parallel actions of the series... as Scully gives birth accompanied by Monica Reyes and an ""alien invasion"" headed by Billy Miles, Doggett and Skinner try to avoid being killed by Knowle Rohrer and another agent-alien-replicant-supersoldier.Here is my TOP for this season:10.

It added new characters and opened so many new doors to the future of the show.Gillian Anderson portrays a pregnant and emotional Scully, perfectly. Shes vulnerable and missing Mulder. We are introduced to John Doggett played by Robert Patrick whose on full time, whilst Monica Reyes played by Annabeth Gish is introduced half way as a part time character.This season returns to the horror roots, much like season one, which was much needed at this point. It has some of my all time favourite episodes such as Roadrunners, Per Manum, This is Not Happening and Existence.People complain that Mulder and Scully didnt get enough time together in this season, Mulder had cameos and needed to be centric, his abduction experiences and Scully's pregnancy wasnt discussed enough and the writers didnt make enough effort to show that Scully was still searching for Mulder in the stand alone episodes, i totally agree, but it didnt stop me enjoying this season completely which i hadn't done since season four.Its the most underrated season and should have definately ended the show with a fantastic episode and closing scene. It shouldnt have continued into an unecessery season nine which pushed the show and the two leads too far, they simply had lost interest, along with the fans.Watch this season with an open mind, ignore what disappointed fans say and see for yourself. It isnt the same without classic stand alone invesitgations by mulder and scully, but Doggett is definately a character that grows on you, working well with Gillian Anderson. You will be blown away by her acting this season.Fans fail to understand that this season beats season seven hands down. Its definately a suprise how well the x files can work without david duchovny. His absence is very well explained this season, unlike the plain awful way he's written out in season nine.Dont have high hopes for season nine after watching this classic season, it doesnt justify the show at all.

It was the first time I stayed up late watching so many episodes back to back.All in all, I really think people that feel the show ended with season 6 or 7 should give this one another chance. I wouldn't have wanted to watch another several seasons with the new characters like Chris Carter had originally planned, but just two seasons (this one and the final season) mixing things up with Dogget and Reyes worked very well.

750062,A7PKDOBWW3WQG,B00008YGRY,flask,"[20, 25]","The first sentence uttered by Agent Dana Scully upon discovering Fox Mulder's office being searched by FBI agents in &quot;Within&quot; (8x01) is also the first reaction of the viewer towards Season 8:&quot;What is this?&quot;It is definitely not the TV show that audiences once loved. Season 8 was drastically different and some say the death knell for one of the most popular shows in television history.For The X-Files Season 8, the show had been bravely revamped, but most of the changes were not for the best: the slick cinematography was reminiscent of a music video and often tinted orange; the new characters lacked back-story; the average episode pacing was too languid; the new musical themes were too soapy; the standalone episodes were too recycled; the mythology was too explored and, most of all, the humorous spark found in earlier seasons was replaced by a brooding morbidity.Why the brooding morbidity? There were many critics who felt The X-Files had become too lighthearted by Season 7. I wholly agree with their assessment, but I had expected a reversion to The X-Files Season 3 formula: dark content matter yet sprinkled with underlying humor, occasional quirkiness and an inspirational undertone. Instead, Season 8 is the darkest and goriest of all The X-Files seasons -- often too dark and gory -- and seemingly devoid of its prior uplifting center. Perhaps that missing center was David Duchovny.For the past seven seasons, David Duchovny's beloved character, Fox Mulder, had been the axis upon which the show spun. His quests to expose a global conspiracy, to find his father's killers and to learn what truly happened to his abducted sister Samantha were overarching subplots which kept the viewer tuned in season after season. By the end of the lackluster Season 7, these various subplots had all been resolved. His character had been explored to its fullest extent. Understandably, Duchovny abandoned his status as the &quot;lead star;&quot; thus, signaled the beginning of the end for this innovative television series. To appease the rabid fans, Duchovny returned for less than half the episodes in Season 8 as part of the ensemble cast. Oddly enough, David Duchovny's timely exodus did not stop the show's creator, Chris Carter, from dragging the show onward.Chris Carter refused to believe The X-Files centered on Duchovny's Fox Mulder. Instead, Chris Carter decided to introduce the &quot;next generation of X-Files agents&quot; starring the skeptic, Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and the believer, Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Both Patrick and Gish are excellent actors, but they lacked the amazing on-screen chemistry of Duchovny and Anderson. In addition to these new characters/actors, a mediocre subplot surrounding half-human / half-metal &quot;super soldiers&quot; was introduced. In short, Carter tried to start from scratch again, but soon found himself mired by drooping ratings and, most of all, an unwieldy budget due to costly U.S. filming locations.The location switch from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Los Angeles, California, was a smart one when The X-Files was at its peak and had the Nielsen ratings to balance out its steep production costs. This location switch, however, was to prove its ultimate demise. When casual fans did not see David Duchovny at the beginning of Season 8, they stopped watching the series and the ratings went down the drain at a phenomenal rate. The show was no longer a hit. By the end of Season 8, The X-Files was a seldom-watched television show with a jaw-dropping $4 million per episode budget. It was a financial burden to the Fox Network who had far more successful shows at the time which cost far less to make. Had The X-Files remained in Vancouver, British Columbia, a cheaper budget might have persuaded Fox Network to let Carter remold the show with Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish as its new leads. Unfortunately, The X-Files was burning a hole in Fox's pocket and it didn't have the resources to wait for the show to gain a new fan base. Subsequently, the show bowed out with the all-too-swift ninth season.Now, the inescapable question:&quot;Is The X-Files Season 8 worth buying on DVD?&quot;If you are a diehard fan or a pathological completist, yes. If you are a casual viewer, you may have better venues in which to invest your hard-earned money. Although this season does contain some interesting episodes and is better than the disappointing Season 7, it is not worth the expensive price tag and viewing time.Overall...The X-Files' Seasons 1

When I was twelve years old there was littlethat could draw my attention to television in quite the same way.It's absolutely wonderful then, that Chris Carter, the proven moron behind theX-files has managed to take those eight years, and flush them down the toilet,followed neatly by his turd.This is rubbish isn't it? No, no, come on,let's not pretend. We know good televisionwhen we see it, else we would never have watched the X-files in the first place.What we have here is bordering on brain-death. Chris Carter must be retardedto take series eight under his surf-bum wing. Don't get me wrong, respect tothe man for making it all happen, but something has gone drastically wrong.Existence-wow. What a conclusion. It was about as much fun to watch as runninga cheese grater over my face. Skinner decided he would turn into 'the one' fromthe Matrix, firing the cheesiest CG bullet EVER into the screen, killing Krychek(the shows last character with any remaining integrity) for ultimately, no reasonwhatsoever. The plot's just gone, man. I have about as much of an idea of what'sactually going on as, say, Chris Carter, and then to top it off, they kissed.Jeez, I waited for that for eight years of my life, I was expecting it to bedone a little better. No, a lot better. My jaw dropped so hard-I spent the nexttwenty minutes being held back by my family from urinating on the televisionscreen.This is what happens when people don't know when to quit. If a show has runit's course, finish it, don't kill it. It's all horribly wrong, and anyone whoactually likes the X-files, and values everything it was, has absolutely noreason to argue.This is where I switch off.(0 out of 3 people so far huh. Ha ha.) I really can't see your problem, this season is one of the worst things to ever be aired on T.V. Think about it.

Give me a break people.I understand Carter soldiered on bravely after the departure of David Duchovny.  I also understand that the premise of the X-Files was &quot;Mulder's search for The Truth.&quot;  Take Mulder out of the equation and what do you have?  Very predictably, a schizophrenic TV show that was forced to tease viewers with the return of Mulder in order to get ratings.Personally, I love Robert Patrick.  His work in Terminator 2--as well as those wonderful Outer Limits episodes--was top-notch.  But here, he's obviously struggling to fit in, and the chemistry just isn't right.  I felt sorry for him--obviously if he could have made this work it would have been the coup of his career.  But by mid-way through this season it became obvious he was just there to play out the string.I'm NOT saying don't buy this season.  I did.  But I am saying MAKE NO MISTAKE:  the X-Files died when Duchovny left the series.Trash this review all you want.  Truth is truth.  Deal with it.  Buy seasons 1-5 and enjoy one of the finest TV series ever created--the one that finally dethroned The Twilight Zone for cult-gone-mainstream excellence.

750065,A169CPBR76SEF1,B00008YGRY,Ian K. Hughes,"[63, 68]","Season 8 (21 episodes airing 2000-2001) was the most atypical of all nine years of THE X FILES for several reasons:1. Much of the season makes due without the services of David Duchovny.2. New characters, assuming key roles, are introduced.3. An unprecedented percentage (nearly half) of the episodes are devoted to the mythology arc.There is a noticeable, almost ""symphonic"", symmetry to the season (composer Mark Snow's haunting ""Scully theme"" functioning as ""idee fixe"") with the mythology arc divided into several well-defined sections: an opening 2-part prelude, massive 5-part mid season ""adagio"" and grand 2-part finale.The loss of David Duchovny's full participation actually had the effect of re-focusing THE X FILES. Chris Carter and company were put to the test in coming up with an interesting and (somewhat) cohesive storyline that would work around the practical ( business related ) realities they faced behind the scenes. Though not without missteps, Season 8 succeeded both in revitalizing the dramatic intensity of the myth arc and maintaining the shows inexorable momentum toward a conclusion revealing much of Chris Carter's longstanding underground project.In Season 8 Gillian Anderson became the lynchpin of THE X FILES, continuing to summon up her considerable skills in service to the show. The casting of Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett was a stroke of genius; Doggett was written and acted in complete distinction to Mulder. This well-planned strategy allowed the imaginative landscape of THE X FILES to be viewed through the fresh eyes of a new character; in the process, some of the excitement of the show's early years was regained for longtime aficionados. Additionally, a measure of stability and strength is found in the season-long emphasis of producing truly serious scripts. The result is a consistently ""dark"" mood, similar to the melancholia found throughout Season 4. In fact, only in a short midseason slump did the show exhibit signs of true weakness.The ""stand alone"" scripts, while certainly not the main emphasis of Season 8, were noticeable improvements over the previous season:Vince Gilligan's ultra-violent ""Roadrunners"" (his only contribution in Season 8) is the single finest ""stand alone"" of the year, a savage parody of a religious sect ( barely disguised ) combined with an homage to the sci-fi classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". This is the first episode (aired early in the season) in which it is apparent that Gillian Anderson and Robert Patrick really ""click"" as a team; a most fortunate happenstance as the fate of the remaining two years depend in large part on their convincing onscreen chemistry. THE X FILES would never have maintained its integrity had the (platonic) Scully/Doggett partnership failed onscreen.David Amann's moving ""Invocation"" is the first of several episodes over the course of the final 2 seasons that deal with the past event that most shaped Agent Doggett: the kidnapping and murder of his son (""Empedocles"" was the other script so featured in Season 8).Longtime staff writer Frank Spotnitz has a very prominent role in shaping Season 8; in addition to co-writing several episodes with Chris Carter, Spotnitz penned several solo scripts:The excellent ""Via Negativa"", in addition to being superior on its own terms, has the additional virtue (shared with ""Invocation"") of allowing Robert Patrick to flesh out his character (David Lynch style cinematography adds a visually disturbing element to the storyline).""The Gift"" is one of the strangest X FILES episodes ever produced, a hallucinatory combination of ""stand alone"" and ""mythology"", all the more bizarre for the flashbacks which (purportedly) explain Mulder's pre-abduction illness.""Alone"" (aired late in the season) is essentially written for the elegiac touches of its final minutes, with Scully and Mulder humorously yet touchingly ""passing the torch"" on to a young and admiring FBI agent, the latter character symbolic of the legions of loyal (and often demanding) ""X-Philes"".Regarding the failures in Season 8:""Salvage"", ""Sure kill"" and especially the execrable ""Baddlea"" should never have been aired. One of the most valuable aspects of this complete DVD set will be to allow the viewer to bypass inferior episodes and concentrate on the otherwise laudable unity demonstrated throughout Season 8.Regarding the mythology arc:The aforementioned symphonic structure of the season begins with Chris Carter's two-parter (""Within""/""Without""), which has the pregnant Scully searching for an abducted Mulder.Carter and Spotnitz collaborate on the pivotal mid season block of mythology episodes dealing with the death and resurrection of Fox Mulder. One cannot help but notice the debt owed to the 2nd/3rd season trilogy (""Anasazi"" / ""The Blessing Way"" / ""Paper Clip"" ).Chris Carter wrote the season finale (""Essence""/""Existence""), which is the mirror image (in terms of title and plot) of the season opener. The series' philosophical (indeed, theological) underpinnings, while by no means hidden in previous seasons, are laid bare with allusions and typological references to the New Testament (as well as the metaphysics of Aquinas reflected in the episode titles).While ""Essence""/""Existence"" was fashioned in such a way as to provide a satisfactory conclusion to both the 8th season and the series as a whole (should it have ended in 2001), it turned out that many of its themes would be carried over into what would in actuality become the final year. THE X FILES would eventually complete its long (9 year) run in artistic and spiritual unity; a testimony to the integrity of cast, writers, crew and (above all) creative vision of Chris

750066,A1XO58KR12PC91,B00008YGRY,"Iqbal Faizer ""Muldfeld""","[6, 8]","I watched The X-Files since Season 2, saw every single episode since, and caught most Season 1 episodes in reruns.  Firstly, I think, on an average episode basis, Seasons 3 and 4 were the best, especially in terms of dialogue.  Secondly, the mythologies rose and declined independent of the average quality of a season;  Seasons 5, 6, and 7 had some fantastic mythology episodes compared to Season 2 mythology episode style which was slow-paced and boring with poor dialogue, despite its wonderful overall stories.  Season 8 added vigor to a mythology series that lost quality after Season 5.  In contrast, Season 9 had some high-quality stand-alones, but absolutely horrible mythology episodes, except for the finale which was well-done in style and dialogue, but felt a little uninspired in story.While I agree that the loss of Mulder was somewhat problematic, his and Scully's interaction in Seasons 6 and especially 7 became quite dull, as writers were unable to come up with themes that were different enough or stories that were interesting enough in many cases.  The majority of Season 7 episodes were uninspired, though there were some gems, while Season 8 allowed a whole new dynamic.Robert Patrick brought a great, well-acted character to the show.  While Scully's reversal feels forced and while Patrick's character may pale in comparison to Mulder, the latter's seven-year run meant that he had lost steam;  in short, Season 8 Doggett (Robert Patrick) was far better and more interesting compared to Season 7 Mulder since he was new, interesting, and hadn't been explored.  Sure, there are some stinkers, mostly in the middle of the season.  However,Within/Without,Invocation,Redrum,Via Negativa,The Gift,This Is Not Happening/DeadAlive& Essence are all great, dynamic and interesting -- rivalling most episodes found in Season 4.Even Empedocles has great subplot interaction between Monica Reyes, Doggett and the returned Mulder character that is exciting and refreshing.There are some terrible episodes:  Roadrunners, Surekill, Salvage, Badlaa, but these are no worse than some episodes in Seasons 5 through 7Middling episodes with nice interaction and dialogue -- even if their overall stories were a bit uninspired -- were:PatienceAlonewith Per Manum,Three Words,Vienen,and Existence continuing the trend started in Season 6 of drawn-out mythologies, with repeated themes and action-oriented scenes to make up for the lack of dramatic innovation.  Still, any episodes featuring Mulder have great appeal if only for the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and the romantic angle to his relationship with Scully which is very charming.  Overall, if you liked Seasons 5 through 7, and aren't fanatical about seeing Mulder for the sake of Mulder, but like good stories and have an open mind, BUY SEASON EIGHT.",4,"Great season, and, in many ways, better than Seasons 6 and 7",1090281600,"07 20, 2004",2004,2821,"['watched', 'X-Files', 'Season', '2', 'saw', 'single', 'episode', 'caught', 'most', 'Season', '1', 'episodes', 'reruns', 'Firstly', 'think', 'average', 'episode', 'basis', 'Seasons', '3', '4', 'were', 'best', 'especially', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'Secondly', 'mythologies', 'rose', 'declined', 'independent', 'average', 'quality', 'season', 'Seasons', '5', '6', '7', 'had', 'fantastic', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'compared', 'Season', '2', 'mythology', 'episode', 'style', 'was', 'slow-paced', 'boring', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'wonderful', 'overall', 'stories', 'Season', '8', 'added', 'vigor', 'mythology', 'series', 'lost', 'quality', 'Season', '5', 'contrast', 'Season', '9', 'had', 'high-quality', 'stand-alones', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'finale', 'was', 'well-done', 'style', 'dialogue', 'felt', 'little', 'uninspired', 'story.While', 'agree', 'loss', 'Mulder', 'was', 'somewhat', 'problematic', 'Scully', 'interaction', 'Seasons', '6', 'especially', '7', 'became', 'quite', 'dull', 'writers', 'were', 'unable', 'come', 'up', 'themes', 'were', 'different', 'enough', 'stories', 'were', 'interesting', 'enough', 'many', 'cases', 'majority', 'Season', '7', 'episodes', 'were', 'uninspired', 'were', 'gems', 'Season', '8', 'allowed', 'whole', 'new', 'dynamic.Robert', 'Patrick', 'brought', 'great', 'well-acted', 'character', 'show', 'Scully', 'reversal', 'feels', 'forced', 'Patrick', 'character', 'may', 'pale', 'comparison', 'Mulder', 'latter', 'seven-year', 'run', 'meant', 'had', 'lost', 'steam', 'short', 'Season', '8', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'more', 'interesting', 'compared', 'Season', '7', 'Mulder', 'was', 'new', 'interesting', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'explored', 'Sure', 'are', 'stinkers', 'mostly', 'middle', 'season', 'However', 'Within/Without', 'Invocation', 'Redrum', 'Via', 'Negativa', 'Gift', 'Not', 'Happening/DeadAlive', 'Essence', 'are', 'great', 'dynamic', 'interesting', 'rivalling', 'most', 'episodes', 'found', 'Season', '4.Even', 'Empedocles', 'great', 'subplot', 'interaction', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Doggett', 'returned', 'Mulder', 'character', 'exciting', 'are', 'terrible', 'episodes', 'Roadrunners', 'Surekill', 'Salvage', 'Badlaa', 'are', 'worse', 'episodes', 'Seasons', '5', '7Middling', 'episodes', 'nice', 'interaction', 'dialogue', 'even', 'overall', 'stories', 'were', 'bit', 'uninspired', 'were', 'PatienceAlonewith', 'Per', 'Manum', 'Three', 'Words', 'Vienen', 'Existence', 'continuing', 'trend', 'started', 'Season', '6', 'drawn-out', 'mythologies', 'repeated', 'themes', 'action-oriented', 'scenes', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'dramatic', 'innovation', 'Still', 'episodes', 'featuring', 'Mulder', 'have', 'great', 'appeal', 'only', 'dynamic', 'Mulder', 'Doggett', 'romantic', 'angle', 'relationship', 'Scully', 'very', 'charming', 'Overall', 'liked', 'Seasons', '5', '7', 'are', ""n't"", 'fanatical', 'seeing', 'Mulder', 'sake', 'Mulder', 'good', 'stories', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'BUY', 'SEASON', 'EIGHT']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season

Where on earth shall I begin?Unlike other seasons, the eighth season ushered in absolutely nothing! The first (and possibly second best) season brought Mulder and Scully together and started the REAL mythology (The Erlenmeyer Flask 1x23). The second season (the best) improved the storytelling techniques that were sure to improve in the  spectacular and brilliant third season. The fourth season is when Mulder and Scully seem to lose ground to the global forces surronding them. When Mulder is infected with the black oil and Scully finds out that she has inoperable brain cancer. The fifth season set the mythology up as a war, a 'battle between heaven and earth' as Krychek said it. The sixth season basically wrapped the mythology up and season seven ended having Mulder abducted and Scully pregnant. Season seven also gave birth to stupid season eight and stupid season eight gave birth to horrible season nine! I'm sorry...I got wrapped up thinkin bout the good ol dayz of X-Files.Anywayz...The heart of the X Files is ripped out when 'Within' (8x01) premiered and Duchovny was nowhere in sight. It just didn't feel the same. We also had to put up with an unrecognizable Scully, who, just seems to whine and cry at the camera every chance she gets. Now, we do know as of now that her and Mulder did have something goin on behind closed doors, but, we've seen her hold it together better than this when her father and sister died! Who is this...John Dogget? What is his purpose? He just seems to stand around the whole time...lookin wooden and stiff. I would have liked to see Skinner get into the action with Scully. Carter could have left Dogget out of the picture completely. There was barely anything left to tell in the series. The mythology had be resolved, Mulder's sister Samantha was turned into starlight....or something. The Cigarette-Smoking man had become an outcast, and Mulder and Scully had already admitted their feelings to each other. Hell, there really shouldn't have been a seventh season (Which did have the title of being the worst season ever until this junk and season nine hit the streets).As for the mythology episodes....bah! All just piles of sweltering rubbish upon rubbish!And when Mulder does 'return', Gibson Praise gets more screen time than him! Talk about unfair!With Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and the REAL Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) gone, and new, absurd and dumb characters abound, this DVD is NOT WORTH ANY OF YOUR HARD EARNED CASH! Save the money and take your girl out to eat or somethin'. Whomever says this junk is more than two stars has never sat down and watched X-Files seasons 1-5. They also like crappy crap, as well. 'Deadalive'(8x15) is a crappy episode and 'Patience'(8x04...well I'm not even gonna go there). Via Negativa (8x07) is so terrible, you won't finish watching it. Ugh! As your friend and ally, DO NOT BUY THIS! This is just horrible! I can't believe they are actually gonna charge money for this garbage! They say 'Three Words' (8x18) is the best episode of the season, well no. It is just an rubbish episode! Utterly dispicable!I've NEVER in my life seen this many garbage episodes in an X-Files season (besides season nine).

750074,A1EKA9XSI641C9,B00008YGRY,John S. Milas,"[2, 3]","Season 7 left off on one giant cliffhanger.  I won't spoil too much, but the abduction of Mulder was a huge event in the series storyline, obviously having heavy effects on the story of the next season: eight.  This season opens up with the search for Mulder in a great two parter, which brings back Gibson Praise briefly.  From there, a new guy, Agent Dogget, serves as Mulder's replacement until his eventual return towards the last third of the season.  I find that this season is equal to season 7, but maybe a little less because of the heavy involvement of mythology episodes.  The thing is, season 7 really didn't have much to offer in terms of mythology, and season 8 is almost compensating for that, giving us an overdose.  New aspects such as super soldiers are introduced into the mix, and the writers even do some retconning to explain some things about Mulder and Scully that we weren't told in season 7, which is something of a cop-out.  Another thing that's a little disappointing is that with new characters being introduced and a much bigger focus on mythology stuff, there isn't room for comedy episodes in this series, a first since season 1.  Kersh makes an enormous comeback in this season after his absence in season 7.  He is now the Deputy Director, and in conjunction with being in charge, he's a pesky obstacle.  I like how more  characters are involved in the episodes now on the protagonist side.  We have Mulder, Scully, Skinner, Dogget, and Reyes involved in several episodes towards the end of the show, which gives the writers license to have multiple conflicts taking place at once during an episode.  The show ends on a great two parter that involves Scully's baby being born, the return of Billy Miles from the beginning of the season, and the death of a major character in the series who I will not disclose.  Adam Baldwin as a super soldier makes a great performance in his episodes, setting up his character for further use in season 9.  I will say this:  Most of the episodes in this season are good.  I wouldn't pick out any in the whole season that I would classify as bad.

We watched 1-6 of these seasons with rapt fascination, enjoying each one it its turn.Then we watched Season 7 and thought, &quot;Hmmm. Something is different. The episodes are lighter, somewhat goofier, more humorous...but, thankfully, Mulder and Scully seem to be getting closer emotionally.&quot;In other words, even though Season 7 contained a few good episodes, we thought it was the weakest season we had watched to date.Since I knew David Duchovny's character (Fox Mulder) essentially left the show at the end of Season 7, I didn't have high hopes for Season 8. I read a few Amazon reviews and was expecting Season 8's stories to be just as fluffy, uneven and unsatisfying as those of Season 7. So I held off buying Seasons 8 and 9 until just last week. (I'm a completist and I really *had* to have all 9 seasons, even if they weren't up to par with the first 1-6.)What a mistake! I shouldn't have waited! Season 8 is amazing!Season 8's episodes are darker, more intense, and better written than any I've seen in a long time. Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick), whom my wife and I were all set to dislike with a passion -- because he took the place of Fox Mulder, one of TV's most all-time enjoyable characters -- surprised the heck out of us.Robert Patrick is an excellent actor, and his character has shown a lot of depth, emotion and change over the course of the 15 episodes of Season 8 we've watched so far.We tend to measure a show's Creativity Quotient by how often our jaws drop and we say, &quot;Wow.&quot; Season 8 of The X-Files caused us to do that a lot. So many times we wouldn't go to bed until 11:30 or later because we had to watch episode after episode to find out what happens next.We did that tonight, in fact. We just watched the episodes where Mulder comes back from the dead (&quot;Deadalive&quot;) and the one following (&quot;Three Words&quot;). We were blown away -- totally swept away by the emotion Scully felt for Mulder, completely caught up in the unfolding story lines.That's how the entire Season 8 has been for us, actually. Each episode took us by surprise. We haven't been let down by a single episode in this season! Really. Of all the seasons of The X-Files we watched, Season 8 surprised us the most. It just flat-out surprised us.If Robert Patrick had not been such a great actor, and if the stories had not been so gripping, the loss of Fox Mulder would have sent The X-Files into a tailspin. But it's impossible not to like Agent Doggett. The character showed that he's a man of ethics, loyalty and determination. In his own way, Doggett is just as driven to find &quot;the truth&quot; as Mulder is.The bottom line? Season 8 didn't spiral downward. And it certainly isn't as weak as other reviewers have lead you to believe. Instead, the writers and directors and actors in Season 8 reached deep and made the show about STORY rather than CHARACTER. The solid stories have carried the day. And then some.If you haven't yet purchased Season 8 of The X-Files because you've read some negative reviews, please reconsider. If you don't think The X-Files could be any good without Mulder, please think again.I'd rate Season 8 of The X-Files right up there with my favorite seasons, which are probably Seasons 3-5. Season 8 offers incredible stories, powerful emotions, and a new character (John Doggett) that you'll respect and, eventually, grow to like (and admire) quite a bit.I highly recommend Season 8 of The X-Files.",5,Some of the best writing and acting of the series!,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,3545,"['just', 'recently', 'wife', 'had', 'were', 'X-Files', 'Seasons', '1-7', 'DVD', 'watched', '1-6', 'seasons', 'rapt', 'fascination', 'enjoying', 'one', 'turn.Then', 'watched', 'Season', '7', 'thought', 'quot', 'Hmmm', 'Something', 'different', 'episodes', 'are', 'lighter', 'somewhat', 'goofier', 'more', 'humorous', 'thankfully', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'closer', 'emotionally.', 'quot', 'other', 'words', 'even', 'Season', '7', 'contained', 'few', 'good', 'episodes', 'thought', 'was', 'weakest', 'season', 'had', 'watched', 'date.Since', 'knew', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'character', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'essentially', 'left', 'show', 'end', 'Season', '7', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'Season', '8', 'read', 'few', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'was', 'expecting', 'Season', '8', 'stories', 'be', 'just', 'fluffy', 'uneven', 'unsatisfying', 'Season', '7', 'So', 'held', 'off', 'buying', 'Seasons', '8', '9', 'just', 'last', 'week', ""'m"", 'completist', 'really', '*had*', 'have', '9', 'seasons', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'up', 'par', 'first', '1-6', 'What', 'mistake', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'waited', 'Season', '8', 'amazing', 'Season', '8', 'episodes', 'are', 'darker', 'more', 'intense', 'better', 'written', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'Agent', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'whom', 'wife', 'were', 'set', 'dislike', 'passion', 'took', 'place', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'one', 'TV', 'most', 'all-time', 'enjoyable', 'characters', 'surprised', 'heck', 'us.Robert', 'Patrick', 'excellent', 'actor', 'character', 'shown', 'lot', 'depth', 'emotion', 'change', 'course', '15', 'episodes', 'Season', '8', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'so', 'far.We', 'tend', 'measure', 'show', 'Creativity', 'Quotient', 'how', 'often', 'jaws', 'drop', 'say', 'quot', 'Wow.', 'quot', 'Season', '8', 'X-Files', 'caused', 'do', 'lot', 'So', 'many', 'times', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'bed', '11:30', 'later', 'had', 'watch', 'episode', 'episode', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'next.We', 'did', 'tonight', 'fact', 'just', 'watched', 'episodes', 'where', 'Mulder', 'back', 'dead', 'quot', 'Deadalive', 'quot', 'one', 'following', 'quot', 'Three', 'Words', 'quot', 'were', 'blown', 'away', 'totally', 'swept', 'away', 'emotion', 'Scully', 'felt', 'Mulder', 'completely', 'caught', 'up', 'unfolding', 'story', 'lines.That', 'how', 'entire', 'Season', '8', 'been', 'actually', 'episode', 'took', 'surprise', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'let', 'down', 'single', 'episode', 'season', 'Really', 'seasons', 'X-Files', 'watched', 'Season', '8', 'surprised', 'most', 'just', 'flat-out', 'surprised', 'us.If', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'such', 'great', 'actor', 'stories', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'gripping', 'loss', 'Fox', 'Mulder', 'would', 'have', 'sent', 'X-Files', 'tailspin', 'impossible', 'not', 'like', 'Agent', 'Doggett', 'character', 'showed', 'man', 'ethics', 'loyalty', 'determination', 'own', 'way', 'Doggett', 'just', 'as', 'driven', 'find', 'quot', 'truth', 'quot', 'Mulder', 'is.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Season', '8', 'did', ""n't"", 'spiral', 'downward', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'as', 'weak', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'lead', 'believe', 'Instead', 'writers', 'directors', 'actors', 'Season', '8', 'reached', 'deep', 'made', 'show', 'STORY', 'rather', 'CHARACTER', 'solid', 'stories', 'have', 'carried', 'day', 'then', 'some.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'purchased', 'Season', '8', 'X-Files', ""'ve"", 'read', 'negative', 'reviews', 'please', 'reconsider', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'X-Files', 'could', 'be', 'good', 'Mulder', 'please', 'think', 'again.I', ""'d"", 'rate', 'Season', '8', 'X-Files', 'right', 'up', 'there', 'favorite', 'seasons', 'are', 'probably', 'Seasons', '3-5', 'Season', '8', 'offers', 'incredible', 'stories', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'new', 'character', 'John', 'Doggett', ""'ll"", 'respect', 'eventually', 'grow', 'like', 'admire', 'quite', 'bit.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Season', '8', 'X-Files']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season
750077,A2PXHFGJZBNLXB,B00008YGRY,Kenji Fujishima,"[7, 9]","As Scully (Gillian Anderson) sits in a big office room waiting to be questioned about the recent disappearance of Mulder (David Duchovny), a man sitting next to her gets up from his seat, gets a cup of water, and offers it to her. He tells Scully that he is an old friend of Mulder's. As they talk, Scully realizes that this man is not who he says he is. She reaches out and turns the nametag on his shirt around. When she finds out who he is, she splashes his face with water from her cup and walks away.It is with that uneasy scene that X-philes everywhere---or, at least, those who hadn't jumped ship in Season 7---were introduced  to John Doggett (Robert Patrick), a tough, no-nonsense investigator who has been assigned the task of leading the search for Mulder, who was abducted at the end of the previous season. That tension would only increase as the season went on, as Doggett is forced to work with Scully on the X-Files as the search goes on for Mulder. And it is with the addition of Robert Patrick to the show that some say that THE X-FILES began its unmistakable descent into decline.I wouldn't say that, exactly. Now, I'll be honest: I was one of the people who jumped ship during Season 7 in the show's initial 9-year run. It is only through syndicated reruns and DVD that I've been able to catch up with these episodes from the controversial 8th season of THE X-FILES. And I believe that, even this late in the game, there are still some things to be said in its favor.Even if David Duchovny was in only about half of the episodes in Season 8, I think it's worth noting that this season marks a return to the darker, creepier style that characterized the early seasons of this show. Those X-philes who had begun to worry that lightheartedness and comedy were starting to take over the show in Seasons 6 & 7 should at least have been relieved to see a darker edge to Season 8 episodes like ""Via Negativa"" or ""Badlaa,"" episodes that arguably may not have been totally out of place in, say, Season 3. Indeed, Season 8 as a whole is a notably serious clutch of episodes, as Scully faces motherhood, and as the X-Files once again faces the danger of being closed down. And, in this season, even standalone episodes seem to tie into these broader character and mythological arcs. ""Invocation,"" for instance, ends with a disappointed Doggett finding no concrete answers from a mystery he and Scully had been investigating, while Scully tries to show him that, on X-files, not everything will have a neat resolution. But then Scully faces a stunning realization of her own at the end of ""Badlaa"": that, try as she might to play the open-minded Mulder role between the two, she and her rational mind can't always summon the same openness Mulder was able to so memorably for their seven years together.The Scully/Doggett relationship has come under fire from a lot of X-philes, some of them complaining of a ""lack of chemistry"" between the two actors. I'll be the last person to admit that Gillian Anderson and Robert Patrick really ever hit it off the same way she and David Duchovny were able to from the pilot onward. Still, it's rather painful to have to state the obvious: their relationship was perhaps never meant to be full of ""chemistry."" Scully's heart has always, and probably always will be, with Mulder (as the closing moment of this season's finale ""Existence"" beautifully demonstrates). What does come across throughout Season 8 is at least a measure of respect that develops between the two. John Doggett may not be nearly as compelling a character as Fox Mulder was, but he's certainly a dedicated agent and a decent human being, one who is innocent of any of the hush-hush conspiracies and secret-keeping that seems to be part and parcel with those who are involved in the X-Files.There is no way I can really make the case that the mythology of Season 8---the search for Mulder, followed by anticipation of Scully's miracle birth---is as convincing or fresh as it was in its first four or five seasons. Clearly, creator Chris Carter and company were basically straining to stretch out the mythology for another season, and, in crucial points, the strain began to show. Anticlimax seems to be the word of the day in both ""Deadalive"" and ""Existence"": there's a strange lack of momentousness when Mulder is finally ""saved"" in the former, and the same could possibly be said for the birth of Scully's baby that occurs at the climax of the latter. Even worse, though, the mythology had become rather predictable by this late season. ""Per Manum"" introduces a new information source for Doggett named Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin)---but perhaps I wasn't the only one to guess that Knowle Rohrer would turn out to be not as sincere as he seemed at first. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) also returns during the season, claiming to want to save Scully's baby from alien replicants looking to destroy it---but I suppose old habits die hard with the man typically known as ""Ratboy"" by fans.Still, even if the mythological developments of the 8th season didn't totally convince (and it would get worse in Season 9), there were still some decent myth episodes to be found---""Vienen,"" for instance, is a fine, suspenseful effort (in which the black oil makes its last real hurrah); so is ""Three Words,"" which throws in the possibility that an alien invasion is upon us. ""Essence""/""Existence"" also manages to serve up some potent thrills, even if the climax disappoints.And the standalones...well, one could argue that these were the only true glories left of the show in these latter seasons. There's only one real dud, I think: ""Surekill,"" which lamely tries to overlay a faint OF MICE AND MEN vibe to its dull story about two brothers involved in some corrupt business, one of whom has the ability to see through walls. Otherwise, a lot of these standalones hearken back to a time when monster-of-the-week episodes actually creeped you out. Some are inevitably better than others: episodes like ""Patience"" and ""Alone"" make the mistake of making silly mutated creatures the focus, while other episodes like ""Via Negativa"" and ""Invocation"" capitalized on deeper, more resonant fears to make its effect. The most interesting of them, though, is possibly ""Empedocles,"" which theorizes that evil is a cycle that spans different time periods, and can sometimes jump from one person to another. When a character dies towards the end of the episode, for instance, his wife immediately catches that evil and attacks an agent for perhaps causing his death. That, and it also has, I think, a cool teaser, as a spirit walks away from the site of a fiery car crash and enters into another person's body.Gillian Anderson proves to be the emotional center of Season 8; for at least one year, it really was her show. From the sadness and desperation she shows in the first half of the season to the anxiety she starts to display as the birth of her son approaches, Dana Scully really went through a lot, and Anderson rarely misses a trick. Scully, of course, has become the ""believer"" to Doggett's ""skeptic,"" but Anderson doesn't simply make her character a female version of Mulder. She's a sharp enough actress to characterize her as a reluctant believer, in a way---she's the one who makes the imaginative leaps, but, listening to Anderson phrase her lines in certain episodes, you get the sense that sometimes she can't even believe the leaps she's making. It's true that her scenes with Robert Patrick during the first half of the season did not have the same frisson as she was able to generate with Duchovny---some of their scenes together in ""Badlaa"" admittedly do seem slackly paced, for example. But, if Patrick is not as imaginative and interesting an actor as Duchovny sometimes was as Mulder, he at least always manages to be watchable. He certainly does bring a presence and a focused intensity to his role that befits the character he plays. And then there's Duchovny himself, who returns in the season's second half and reminds us why it was such a pleasure to watch him and Anderson work together in the past.As far as a rating for Season 8 is concerned: while I hovered between 3 and 4 while writing this review, I felt that I had to go with the higher rating. Mythologically, THE X-FILES has probably been played out by now, but at least it gets one thing right: the emotions evoked are as strong and deep as ever (even if the mythology has ceased to be nearly as interesting). It just shows that, even when the show is not at its best, it is still as potent a mixture of intelligence and scares as there ever was on recent television. Most fans have probably made up their minds about this season already; for relative newbies, though, I still think Season 8 is worth checking out, for all its serious faults.",4,"Played-out mythology,

750079,AXG6TOEDXZON9,B00008YGRY,Kuhndog,"[0, 0]","I assume if you are reading reviews of X-Files Season Eight, you are familiar with the series.  Other reviewers have gone to great detail on this season.  Thus I will hit just a few points... from my perspective (or is that a redundant redundancy?)  Apparently I enjoyed Season Seven better than many reviewers; I wasn't put off by the &#34;light&#34; episodes.  So this season, going back to overly dark, and everything half hidden in shadows, is not a good thing to me.  It almost seems to indicate lack of creativity.  (Calm down!  I mean within the context of The X-Files!)  It's like &#34;Hey, I've got a great idea.  This episode will be dark and moody.&#34;  Like when comic books got darker and grittier.  After the first 100 times, &#34;getting darker and grittier&#34; turned into a comic book clich&eacute; for unimaginative artists and writers.  (I was a huge comic book collector until... wait for it... I got married!)  So a darker tone for the season is fine, but doesn't anyone turn on a light when they read or write a report or enter a building or walk down a hall or...?  I also like the extras, and this season has more extras than previous seasons although I have the slim line version of Seasons 5-7.  I don't know if there is a slim line version of Eight.  So I may not be comparing apples to apples.  Let's just say this season has good extras.

750080,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00008YGRY,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","My first favorite television series was ""Twelve O'clock High"" and I remember being total shocked when the main character, General Frank Savage, was killed on a mission in the first episode of the second season.  The idea that actors leave television shows was news to me and while having a second Darrin is one way of solving the problem without radically changing the dynamic of a show, that is much more the exception (Becky on ""Roseanne,"" Miss Ellie on ""Dallas"") than the rule (especially since the original actors came back on both of those examples).  Going into the eighth season of ""The X-Files"" having David Duchovny as Fox Mulder for the entire season was not going to happen, which meant Chris Carter and his staff were going to have to reboot the show with a new male lead.  Enter Robert Patrick, best known as the T-1000 machine from ""Terminator 2 - Judgment Day,"" as Agent John Dogget.Mulder had finally been abducted by the aliens in the finale of the previous season (""Requiem""), so Dogget is assigned by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (boo, hiss) to head the search for Mulder (""Within"").  However, with a tip from the Lone Gunman, this turns into an effort to stop the alien bounty hunter from destroying Gibson Praise (""Without"").  No good deed goes unpunished, so Dogget ends up running the X-Files with Scully as his less than willing partner who is hiding the fact that she is pregnant.  So of course their early cases involve a bat-like creature (""Patience""), a slug-like creature that is supposed to be the second coming of God (""Roadrunners""), a little boy who vanished ten years ago showing up and had not aged a day (""Invocation""), a killer who can see through walls (""Surekill""), and an Indian mystic (""Badlaa"").  One of my favorite episodes from Season 8 is ""Redrum,"" which brings in another ""T2"" actor, Joe Morton, as a man living the murder of his wife backwards, and which finds Dogget and Scully playing supporting roles in the story (there is also a great in-joke when Dogget complains to Scully about having to track a metallic man in ""Salvage"").There seems to me to be a concerted effort to break up the formula here, so that sometimes Dogget has to go it alone (""Via Negativa,"" ""The Gift""), and once you pick up on that idea you see more variations on the theme.  Scully's pregnancy comes into play when she stays behind as Dogget checks out some strange deaths in a Boston subway tunnel (""Medusa"").  Scully's fears about her baby comes to a head in ""Per Manum,"" which is just before the search for Mulder is over (""This is Not Happening""), and then all Scully has to do is to find a way of bringing him back from the dead (""Deadalive"").  Scully's search for Mulder is reminiscent of his quest to find his sister, or at least what happened to her, but there is a big advantage in that this story arc lasts a dozen episodes and not several seasons.  Add to that Anderson's performance in these episodes providing more of an emotional weight than we are used to on the show.Obviously pairing Dogget with Gillian Anderson's Dana Scully reveres the dynamic that existed at the beginning of the show when Scully was the skeptic and Mulder the true believer.  Now it is Dogget who is the skeptic, but more of a ""knee jerk skeptic"" than the rational scientist that Scully was, just as Scully is now the believer but without the burning passion of Mulder.  Dogget, who was first a Marine and then a police detective before joining the bureau, is also 40 when he joins the X-Files, where as Scully was only 28 when she first showed up).  Ironically, by the time the tension between Scully and Dogget is resolved, Mulder is thrown into the mix and since Scully's pregnancy is coming to full term we get several Doggert and Mulder episodes.  We also have the introduction of Annabeth Gish as Special Agent Monica Reyes, setting up season nine.  Mulder clearly cannot stand Dogget and wants back on the X-Files, but Kersh denies the request (""Three Words"").  Then Reyes comes to Mulder for help investigating the death of Dogget's son (""Empedocles""), which gives Dogget a chance to make it clear he does not like Mulder either.  No wonder the next episode, ""Vienen,"" finds Mulder and Dogget trapped on an oil rig manned by crewmen infected with the black oil virus.The funniest moment in season eight comes at the end of ""Alone,"" with Scully on maternity leave and Dogget partnered with young Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins).  She might be from accounting but she has followed the adventures of Scully and Mulder, so joining the X-Files is a dream come true.  Of course it turns into a nightmare, but when she finally gets to meet her heroes and ask them about the snowcat running out of fuel in themovie, it is absolutely hysterical.  Then things get really serious at the end as Billy Miles starts killing people and has Scully on his target list (""Essence"").  Scully needs to be protected, and Dogget turns to Reyes, who takes Scully to a remote location to finally give birth to that baby (""Existence"") and bring the Mulder and Scully saga of the X-Files to a tentative close (a ninth season was still up in the air at that point).How much you like season eight comes down to how much you like the character of Dogget, and I think he is a solid character.  I like the way the different vibe the show has just because everybody know calls each other ""Agent Scully"" and ""Agent Dogget"" and ""Agent Mulder"" (and eventually ""Mister Mulder"").  Plus, you had to know that in the end that unless he was dead and in the ground (and not coming back) that Mulder was going to be canned by the FBI.  The most unrealistic thing on the show is not the alien conspiracy but how long it takes Kersh to pull the trigger.  For extras on this DVD there is a featurette looking at season eight; profiles from the international videos for x, John Dogget, and Alex Krycek; FOX's promos for all of the episodes; a look at special effects by Mat Beck with commentary by Paul Rabwin; and all of those deleted scenes you never saw because you missed the ""X"" when it went by with optional commentary7 by Frank Spotnitz and John Shiban (the real father of Scully's ""baby"").",5,Agent Dogget replaces Agent Mulder working with Agent Scully on the X-Files,1183248000,"07 1, 2007",2007,6174,"['first', 'favorite',

The trouble with Season 8 of &quot;The X-Files&quot; had zilch to do with editing, Gillian Anderson's hair, or giving birth to alien babies.No, the cause of its downfall is due to all the fickle fans out there who supposedly love the show, only to bash it over the head and proclaim to the heavens how the mighty have fallen.  It's these same idiotic ingrates who couldn't stop proclaiming their passion for &quot;The X-Files&quot; during its glory years, only to turn their noses up at it just because old characters folded and new ones replaced them.How many of you so-called true-blue X-Philes ever gave Season 8 a chance?  As soon as word got out that David Duchovny no longer wished to be involved with the show anymore, it was the end of civilization as you knew it.  Never mind that Chris Carter and all his fellow writers were hard at work to give you what you wanted.  Just ignore the fact that David Duchovny was the ONLY character leaving, and that we still had plenty of Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, Nicholas Lea, and a host of other characters to follow.  You whined and complained, bellyached and moaned, when the pop-culture phenomenon known as &quot;The X-Files&quot; began to, in your eyes, grow stale . . . only to criticize and grumble your little hearts out when the show didn't end and continued to deliver the goods every Sunday night.You wanted more X-Files.  You got more X-Files.  And then you had the gall to gripe about it because, shucky-darn dag-nabbit, it just wasn't the same old show.  Man, talk about biting the hand that feeds you.Season 8 of &quot;The X-Files&quot; was a monumental success, something blatantly obvious if you would only open your eyes, shut your mouth, and suddenly come to that booming realization.  What do you do to replace an actor who wishes to distance himself from the show?  You supplant him with an actor who WANTS to be there, a guy who pumps new life into the show and puts an interesting spin on its dynamics.You hypocritical hicks get all bent out of shape because Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish are trying to steal the reins from David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson?  Don't hate; congratulate.  What, you expect Gillian Anderson and Mitch Pileggi do everything all by themselves?GET OVER IT, PEOPLE.  If you don't like Season 8, turn if off.  Better yet, leave the room so those of us who do appreciate it and what it bestowed us can enjoy it to the fullest.Don't believe all the naysayers on here who think Season 8 of &quot;The X-Files&quot; isn't worth your time.  It is.  These self-proclaimed X-Philes are just bitter, frustrated, and have a pile of sour grapes to boot.  Everyone at 1013 is to be applauded for the dedication and hard work they put into making Season 8 one of the most accomplished seasons in the show's run.Give it a chance.

When this season started out I had a hard time with Robert Patrick, not because I don't like him but he isn't Mulder. The character's attitude was almost too much and too opposite to take in the beginning but he did come around and in fact showed why he was picked for this job and how good the writers were. I liked how the writers move in agent Reyes with Doggett and I agree if they wanted to go maybe a couple or so more years they could have done it even without the Scully character. That doesn't mean Scully wasn't great but in fact that the new actors were holding their own. After Mulder comes back and then you have Mulder, Scully, Reyes, Doggett and of course A.D. Skinner you can really see how good those actors were in this series and how well cast they were. But after watching 8 out of 9 seasons in succession one funny thing that I related to was that the characters were trying to do their jobs amidst of all the political stuff of the FBI, which was not unlike my 12 year careeer in the Navy.

Behind the scenes,David Ducovney was getting tired of his role and wanted less to do with the show,so if you want to be mad at someone,get mad at him!In the script and in front of the camera Dana Scully,(understandably),after years of working with Mulder and witnessing what she has,has become the believer to Doggett's newly arrived skepticism. This role reversal is not only believable,but refreshing.For the viewer commenters who are disappointed that Scully has taken the lead role,I would say that perhaps it is time to let go of your sexual stereotypes!?I also would like to add that the stories may be a bit disconnected from the previous episodes, but again, this makes sense as Scully must back up some to bring Doggett up to speed.Also the plots and story lines have just as much,if not more depth in some ways,than previous episodes.I feel that Chris Carter has brilliantly responded to the cast change that DUCOVNEY cast upon him,(no pun intended),and gave the show the fresh shot in the arm that even David Ducovney felt it needed.Let's all try to move forward with the flow and as my Jazz music friends would say,""enjoy it for what it is,not what you expect it to be!""",5,"Love God,NOT The Preacher!",1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1528,"['most', 'people', 'was', 'reticent', 'when', 'learning', 'Fox', 'role', 'was', 'greatly', 'diminished', 'Season', '8', 'HOWEVER', 'have', 'found', 'thatRobert', 'Patrick', 'excellent', 'job', 'show', 'comments', 'Scully', 'gone', 'character', 'changed', 'let', 'try', 'grow', 'up', 'let', 'go', ""'box"", 'type', 'thinking', 'objectively', 'view', 'what', 'going', 'here', 'scenes', 'David', 'Ducovney', 'was', 'getting', 'tired', 'role', 'wanted', 'less', 'do', 'show', 'so', 'want', 'be', 'mad', 'someone', 'get', 'mad', 'script', 'front', 'camera', 'Dana', 'Scully', 'understandably', 'years', 'working', 'Mulder', 'witnessing', 'what', 'become', 'believer', 'Doggett', 'newly', 'arrived', 'skepticism', 'role', 'reversal', 'not', 'only', 'believable', 'viewer', 'commenters', 'who', 'are', 'disappointed', 'Scully', 'taken', 'lead', 'role', 'would', 'say', 'perhaps', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'sexual', 'stereotypes', 'also', 'would', 'like', 'add', 'stories', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disconnected', 'previous', 'episodes', 'again', 'sense', 'Scully', 'must', 'back', 'up', 'bring', 'Doggett', 'up', 'speed.Also', 'plots', 'story', 'lines', 'have', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'not', 'more', 'depth', 'ways', 'previous', 'episodes.I', 'feel', 'Chris', 'Carter', 'brilliantly', 'responded', 'cast', 'change', 'DUCOVNEY', 'cast', 'pun', 'intended', 'gave', 'show', 'fresh', 'shot', 'arm', 'even', 'David', 'Ducovney', 'felt', 'try', 'move', 'forward', 'flow', 'Jazz', 'music', 'friends', 'would', 'say', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'be']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season
750086,A376YDPAWRIX1C,B00008YGRY,"mugsy ""mugsy1963""","[7, 14]","To be honest with you all, I hardly watched the show after I heard that Duchovny was leaving.  The episodes don't hold up without the Mulder & Scully interaction.  I did not believe the ""I want to believe"" Scully.  Doggett was okay.  I still keep thinking he is looking for Schwartzeneger.  Reyes was annoying.  Her dialogue was insipid (""I just have a feeling.""  Didn't Mulder at least give reasons for his ""feelings?"").  Once Mulder did come back, he was not the same Mulder.  I always found Mulder to be sweet, innocent, and sensitive.  He came back with a definite attitude change.  Did the writers purposely write Mulder that way for fans to like Doggett and forget about Mulder?  What's up with this Super Soldiers concept (or was that in the next season?)?  I also thought I heard rumors of the writers wanting to develop a love interest between Doggett & Reyes, Doggett & Scully, or Reyes & Scully.  Scully a lesbian--that would explain alot.  As you can tell, I have big problems with this season.The pros (very few):(1) Existence.  I would have bet big money that that episode was going to end WHILE Scully was giving birth (X-Files loves writing those cliffhangers!).  I would have LOST.  The episode ended with everything pretty well wrapped up.  The series could have ended here (and we would have avoided viewing the utterly horrible POS they call the ninth season).  The episode is filled with Christmas symbolism: Scully & Monica finding an abandoned home with painted glass window, Mulder following a light to find Scully, the Lone Gunman bearing gifts, etc.  One character dies (should have died in the ninth season).  The writers, earlier in the season, tried to make William's conception a mystery.  In this episode, the writers seemed like they gave up the pretense and finally acknowledged the obvious.  Very sweet ending.(2) Deadalive.  Mulder is alive...again.  To enjoy this episode, one must ignore logic.  How can a man who was autopsied, had blood drained from his body, and buried be up and alive again?  Anyway, I did like this episode.  Mulder and Scully have an interestingly odd conversation when they get to his apartment.  Mulder meets Doggett.(3) Per Manum.  Odd episode.  Scully finds out about her ova but is surprised even though she knew about it in season five.  Scully asks Mulder to be the father of her child, and we are supposed to believe that they are just friends/co-workers?  Episode was set sometime in Season 7.  Very sweet scenes in this episode, though.Mediocre:All other eps with Mulder in them.Cons:All eps without Mulder in them.This season would appeal more to the new x-files fan, not the fans who watched since the show's debut.  There are alot of Doggett & Reyes fans out there, for some reason.  If only those fans watched before now, before the show turned into a soap opera, they would know what high quality show the X-Files was.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[11, 14]","David Duchovny's growing dissatisfaction with his role meant he'd appear in only a few episodes (in the first few episodes his appearances are more like small cameos before finally bringing him fully back until the end of the season), so character actor Robert Patrick (mostly known as the T-1000 from Terminator 2) was brought on board as Special Agent John Doggett (and as the Amazon review says, look out for a few T2 in jokes as well) who would be the new partner for the pregnant Agent Scully (Gillian Anderson).  Mitch Pileggi's role as A.D. Skinner became even more prominant here than in any season before, while another new agent was introduced in Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish).  Contrary to what most long time fans of the series have said about Season 8; I enjoyed it for the most part.  Patrick is great in his role as the skeptical Doggett while Scully's transition from skeptic to believer is progressed very nicely.  Anderson is at her best in her role now more than ever before (and even more beautiful as well), and while the episodes aren't always at the top of the show's calibur from seasons past, this was still the best prime time network drama on TV at the time.  When Mulder is finally brought back, his teaming up with Doggett on an oil rig filled with the alien Black Oil is pure bliss of an X-Files episode.  All in all, this was Duchovny's last season (up until the series finale in Season 9), but this was probably the last memorable season of the series.",4,Severely underrated season of the series,1065744000,"10 10, 2003",2003,1483,"['David', 'Duchovny', 'growing', 'dissatisfaction', 'role', 'meant', ""'d"", 'appear', 'only', 'few', 'episodes', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'appearances', 'are', 'more', 'small', 'cameos', 'finally', 'bringing', 'fully', 'back', 'end', 'season', 'so', 'character', 'actor', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'mostly', 'known', 'T-1000', 'Terminator', '2', 'was', 'brought', 'board', 'Special', 'Agent', 'John', 'Doggett', 'Amazon', 'review', 'look', 'out', 'few', 'T2', 'jokes', 'as', 'well', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'partner', 'pregnant', 'Agent', 'Scully', 'Gillian', 'Anderson', 'Mitch', 'Pileggi', 'role', 'A.D.', 'Skinner', 'became', 'even', 'more', 'prominant', 'here', 'season', 'new', 'agent', 'was', 'introduced', 'Monica', 'Reyes', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'Contrary', 'what', 'most', 'long', 'time', 'fans', 'series', 'have', 'said', 'Season', '8', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'part', 'Patrick', 'great', 'role', 'skeptical', 'Doggett', 'Scully', 'transition', 'skeptic', 'believer', 'progressed', 'very', 'nicely', 'Anderson', 'best', 'role', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'even', 'more', 'beautiful', 'as', 'well', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'top', 'show', 'calibur', 'seasons', 'past', 'was', 'still', 'best', 'prime', 'time', 'network', 'drama', 'TV', 'time', 'When', 'Mulder', 'finally', 'brought', 'back', 'teaming', 'up', 'Doggett', 'oil', 'rig', 'filled', 'alien', 'Black', 'Oil', 'pure', 'bliss', 'X-Files', 'episode', 'was', 'Duchovny', 'last', 'season', 'series', 'finale', 'Season', '9', 'was', 'probably', 'last', 'memorable', 'season', 'series']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season
750089,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00008YGRY,OverTheMoon,"[1, 1]","The X-Files Collection is a worthy hobby and next to Star Trek is certainly one of largest of the television series DVD collections, running an extra two seasons longer than the maximum seven season Star Trek series. Although The X-Files is not the longest running television media franchise, it can boast being one of the longest running SF series airing for nine seasons between 1993 and 2002. At around 1100 minutes per box, you are looking at approx. 9 boxes with 165 hours of viewing. That is nearly 1 full week of non-stop X-Files. Very few DVD series can come even remotely close to that. Get going collecting right now and you could build up the series collection in no time. By the end you will have a television paranormal anthology that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires 1 hour a day of your time over the course of a year. The X-Files creator Chris Carter nails a powerful television series premise, setting up a fringe paranormal bureau of investigation that is at odds with its own department, the government, the military and just about everyone else, with the immortal tagline ""The truth is out there"". Fox ""Spooky"" Mulder (David Duchovny) is the workaholic basement-dwelling good-looking nerd with a heart of gold and a mind for the criminal macabre, all things supernatural and who runs the X-Files department. He is teamed with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the rational doctor turned FBI agent who is asked to write reports on the X-Files cases by her cynical boss. Most episodes play along with the theme of Mulder witnessing a paranormal event while Dana gradually arrives on the scene only after it is over, missing it all, or discovering something odd at best. This kind of regular plot occurrence bonds the characters and is what makes The X-Files so enjoyable. There are some improvements since the Season III DVD case with a seventh bonus disc now inside a cardboard holder and not just sitting in a slot in a piece of card that falls out easily like in Season I and II, bouncing around the box. Season V actually has the bonus disc in with actual holder itself. Not all boxes have this bonus seventh disc item. It depends on the edition. The more important six discs with episodes are firmly in place in a plastic flip case inside a thick season box that slides into a wider cardboard presentation holder for the shelf and looks quite good. Although the inside is slightly flimsy, these DVDs are presented on the cheap and so economically The X-Files seasons are sound value for money but the presentation is nothing to brag about and when we get around to seeing what is on the discs we will not be so blown away either. There are 4 episodes per disc, and 6 episode discs in total, making an average of 25 episodes for most seasons. Some seasons have more or less than this figure. Some discs have a few deleted scenes... and that is about it. On the episode discs there are no commentaries and not much in the way of bonus material except for some international clips with Mulder and Scully speaking in Japanese for a scene. They could have at least provided us with the X-Files remastered in 5:1 Dolby Digital but have instead just presented the series as it was aired in 2:1 surround. Again, everything here is on the cheap. The transfer quality however is very good for most of it. This season is in Widescreen 1.78:1X-Files: Season eight is the one where Mulder leaves the show (in order to pursue a career in film acting) only to appear part time. You may even be in for Mulder's death. The show begins with a brand new introductory credit sequence which actually looks very good and there are two versions, one containing Mulder leading and one without Mulder with Scully leading. This way you know if Mulder will make an appearance or not. The new agent Dogget (Robert Patrick) is set to replace Mulder as Scully's partner. The Cigarette-Smoking Man (William B. Davis) is gone from the show. Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) has more of a lead role. `The Lone Gumen' John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard 'Ringo' Langly (Dean Haglund) are back as is Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is also a brand new addition. FBI Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.) is really playing the bad guy this season along with the new mysterious insider Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin).Season eight of the X-Files is mostly about - Agent Dogget, Gibson Praise, time travel, monster bats, religious cults, ghosts, drugs, alien pregnancy, x-ray vision, metal man, pain, Indian mystics, viruses, Mulder, alien black oil, Doggett's son, alien colonisation, mutants and Scully's child. Dogget is essentially the new sceptic so he and Scully have a lot of fun in the single episodes. Also thankfully Season eight completely omits the slapstick humour change that Season seven tried out towards the end. The cast update is actually not bad, and do stay all the way through with this season and don't just abandon it completely. This is an action-packed season with some great episodes.The major problem however is not with this season but what the producers are hiding from us. You don't see this until season nine. Essentially Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) is here to replace Scully. Yeah the producers are going to be moving in the direction of Special Agent Monica Reyes and Agent Dogget leading the X-Files for Season nine and possibly more. However Season nine killed the X Files. It is easy to give this series 4 to 5 stars without knowing what the producers are planning (I originally gave it 5) but when you know the truth! you can easily dock down. So Mulder essentially did leave the show in season 7 and Scully is leading for the time being but doing bit parts in season nine.",3,They are replacing Mulder and Scully with Dogget and

I also like the introduction of Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish into the X-Files, although their working relationship wasn't much of a story line until the ninth season.  What deeply disappoints me with this DVD set is the very weak commentary track by director Kim Manners on the season finale, &quot;Existence&quot;. He sounds like he just woke up or was on an all-night bender.  For every 10 seconds he speaks, there are 50 seconds of silence.  There is one comment he makes, however, that sums up the problem with season eight.  &quot;I really miss the Syndicate&quot;.  The new consipiracy of the alien replacements for humans (remember that 1950's movie about the pea pods that have an alien that takes you over when you sleep? - same concept) is nowhere near as exciting as the Syndicate.  There are some great episodes here, though.  The first two - &quot;within&quot; and &quot;without&quot; show Gillian Anderson as a matured actress that can carry a show.  Mulder is sooo close, Scully can feel him, but not see him.  When Mulder returns and dies then rises from the dead with the help of Scully in &quot;This is not happening&quot; and &quot;Deadalive&quot;, it almost felt like the earlier X-Files episodes.  Finish it off with the birth of William in Essence and Existence and you have all the episodes you need.  The rest are not up to par.  Another DVD extra letdown is an uninterested Chris Carter in a not very truthful or revealing &quot;Truth about season Eight&quot;.  I'm not upset that I bought this DVD set, but I think that Kim Manners and Chris Carter should refund me $10 for their uninspired effort.  I can only hope they do better when season 9 comes out.

Patrick, playing agent Doggett, injects some new life into the series and his presence is felt most in the first quarter of the season, as Sully is forced to adjust and eventually must learn to trust her new partner. The situation makes for some interesting drama and works suprisingly well for the most part. The two start out by searching for the missing Mulder, who was abducted in the season seven finale, but then just take over for him in overseeing the X-Files, where Scully now plays the believer and Dogget the skeptic. The reversal is nice and makes sense, Scully is particularly interesting to watch in most episodes as she is really all alone now and struggles with what to do with the rest of her life. Patrick is also very interesing to watch, his 'new guy' role in the series must have been similar to his real-life 'new guy' role on set behind the scenes, he does his best to fill the large shoes of Duchovny's character and to be honest is a welcome change to the seemingly bored Duchovny of season seven. Still, Mulder does return for the second half of the season but his presence is never the same as it was and is more of a drag as we know he will just disappear all over again in the final season.All in all, season eight of X-Files does its best to make up for the loss of half of its leading duo but struggles in a way the show hasn't ever before.

The intro episodes has Dana Scully searching fervently for any trace or information on the whereabouts of Mulder when the bureau transfers a new agent to replace the missing Mulder into the X-files department. Of course Scully's suspicious at first of Dogget's personal agendas and feelings but slowly during the season begins to trust and befriend him.  For me Agent Dogget was a welcome new character to the show he was what the character of Scully was in the first season a skeptic who believed and the physical facts and science of the world and not hocus pocus or alien life-forms he has never seen.  Also later during the series we had another new character Monica Reyes an old friend of Doggets enter into the life of the X-files agents.  The episodes on whole were for me hit and misses but still I feel this would have rejuvenated the series for a few more years unfortunately the show was either canceled after season 9 or they decided to end it there I can't really remember.

750099,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00008YGRY,Robert Moore,"[12, 13]","A huge number of fans of the first seven seasons have either failed to give Season Eight a fair viewing, or have refused to see it at all.  This is a shame, because this is for the most part an enormously entertaining, marvelously produced season.  No, it doesn't come quite up to the level of the first six seasons, which were astonishing for their consistency, but I have to confess that I might overall prefer Season Eight to Season Seven, which despite some great moments was subject to some inconsistency.  The major reason people do not like Season Eight is the greatly diminished role that David Duchovny's Agent Fox Mulder played in the show, and indeed, for those of us for whom the interplay between Mulder and Scully represented one of the high points in television history, it was a major loss indeed.  For all practical purposes, Mulder is missing from the first two thirds of the season, and even when he comes back, his presence adds less than one might have hoped.  Still, for those with open minds, Season Eight remains a worthy successor to the X-FILE mantle.The main reason Season Eight succeeds is that one performer achieved the near-impossible:  Robert Patrick as Agent John Doggett steps into Fox Mulder's shoes and pretty much fills them.  It is an absolutely astonishing achievement, and I can't think of another performer in TV history replacing an iconic character and more or less managing to succeed.  Doggett and Scully do not have anywhere near the ying-yang chemistry of Mulder and Scully, but they end up having a nice working relationship of their own.  Scully is adamantly determined not to get along with Doggett, but as she puts it later in the season, she comes to respect his depth of character, as does Mulder upon his return.  Unlike Scully and Mulder, Doggett is an FBI man, a career law enforcement professional who is more of a cop than anything else.  He is stubborn, loyal, courageous, and possesses a vast amount of integrity.  As an actor, I love Patrick's low, gravelly drawl (without checking to see where he is from, I'd bet somewhere from the Old South, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, or Mississippi).  Like many X-FILE fans, I refused to even watch the last two seasons at the time, and upon watching recently on DVD, I'm amazed at how very much I like him on the show.  With increased recent talk about a series of  X-FILES movies getting started (largely coming from David Duchovny, who speaks of a late 2005 start of filming for a 2006 release), I am actually happy to hear that Doggett is going to be included.Until the end of the season, when the story arc starts that runs into Season 9 (some would say, destroyed Season Nine) begins, the season is more monster-of-the-week in format more than anything else.  Whatever story arc exists focuses more on Dana's coming to deal with Mulder's disappearance and her own pregnancy, and her reluctance to accept John Doggett has her new partner.  Along the way we get a series of absolutely brilliant standalone episodes that are as striking and original as most in the history of the X-FILES.Nonetheless, the last three seasons of THE X-FILES represent in the overall context of the series a decline.  This didn't mean that there weren't many, many brilliant moments and many great episodes.  But Season Six had more or less stopped the long story arcs, something that hurt Season Seven to a great degree.  There were not so much ongoing arcs as remnants of arcs, a problem the show suffered since the resolution of the alienation colonization arc and the demise of the syndicate.  The networks, as they always do, detested anything other than the monster-of-the-week scenario.  Arcs shows are less friendly to either new or occasional viewers.  Monster-of-the-week shows are very friendly to occasional or new viewers.  Seasons Eight and Nine tried to reintroduce some arcs, but unfortunately they were arcs that even the most faithful fans of the show have trouble enjoying.  For once, the formidable skills of the X-FILES writing staff failed them.  The other downside of Season Eight was the unpleasant presence of Assistant Director Kersh, unquestionably the recurring X-FILES character with the fewest redeeming characters.But decline or not, Season Eight still presented television at its absolute best.  I will admit a pang of agony the first time the opening credits ran and began not with the familiar picture of Mulder's FBI ID, but began instead with Scully's.  The greatest team in television history was parted!  And though Mulder would be back for a few more episodes they would not actually be a team again.  All good things must come to an end.  But hopefully Mulder and Scully will ride again if the films that Duchovny, Patrick, and Carter all say they hope to make soon come off.",5,A tremendously underrated and neglected

I saw the movie, but I found it strange and hard to follow. Of course, this turned me off to the series as a whole. Before my seven month deployment, I had never even seen an episode of the X-files.A friend of mine purchased the series for me as a gift to watch on my long boat ride. And, happily, I am proud to say that I watched season one through six on pins and needles on my laptop in a small, little rack.I was so intrigued by the alien abductions and the chemistry between Mulder and Scully. Even some of the more quirky and silly episodes were good because of the M/S combination. Yet, as the seasons moved foward I could see a definite interest with directors and producers to move the series foward while maintaining to the crux of the story originated by Cris Carter.A story that couldn't move forward.But, onto season eight.Well...I just finished watching it, and well...I don't know. It was good...there were some episodes that were very good. Yet, the whole season was wooden and unfilling. Obviously, the chemistry between S/Dogget was lacking.Seriously, I thought it would have been a better idea to bring in a more radical character to oppose Scully's logic truth. It just seemed that she made the switch from logic to paranormal very suddenly and without explanation. I mean...yeah she had something to explain...and you need to watch the season to understand...yet...there wasn't enough explanation.Also, why couldn't they have made this a Scully season? Where she takes on the X files by herself to discovers the real truth? Yet, to they bring in this wooden guy, who I can never get over being the new terminator. And, to try and make the chemistry happen. Well, as I'm sure they (producers, etc) knew the chemistry never happened, and this season felt wrong.Don't get me WRONG. There were so good episodes. But, the series fillers just weren't good. They should have paid David D. serious money to continue on. But, they went ahead with the the lackluster contribution.So, my finale! There is some contribution to the X files that is worth seeing. Plus, this season sets you up with the conclusion to season seven and season nine. I haven't seen season nine yet. But, believe me, I will give you my thoughts when I see it. I decided not to add my overview to seven because generally the entire season was a true X files season. I just thought I would warn you about this season.Shannon",2,Won't Go So Far...,1086134400,"06 2, 2004",2004,2500,"['Well', ""'m"", 'just', 'chiming', 'debate', 'DVDs', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'X', 'files', 'saw', 'movie', 'found', 'strange', 'hard', 'follow', 'course', 'turned', 'series', 'whole', 'seven', 'month', 'deployment', 'had', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'episode', 'X-files.A', 'friend', 'mine', 'purchased', 'series', 'gift', 'watch', 'long', 'boat', 'ride', 'happily', 'am', 'proud', 'say', 'watched', 'season', 'one', 'six', 'pins', 'needles', 'laptop', 'small', 'little', 'rack.I', 'was', 'so', 'intrigued', 'alien', 'abductions', 'chemistry', 'Mulder', 'Scully', 'Even', 'more', 'quirky', 'silly', 'episodes', 'were', 'good', 'M/S', 'combination', 'Yet', 'seasons', 'moved', 'foward', 'could', 'see', 'definite', 'interest', 'directors', 'producers', 'move', 'series', 'foward', 'maintaining', 'crux', 'story', 'originated', 'Cris', 'Carter.A', 'story', 'could', ""n't"", 'move', 'forward.But', 'season', 'eight.Well', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'good', 'were', 'episodes', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'wooden', 'unfilling', 'Obviously', 'chemistry', 'S/Dogget', 'was', 'lacking.Seriously', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'idea', 'bring', 'more', 'radical', 'character', 'oppose', 'Scully', 'logic', 'truth', 'just', 'seemed', 'made', 'switch', 'logic', 'paranormal', 'very', 'suddenly', 'explanation', 'mean', 'yeah', 'had', 'something', 'explain', 'need', 'watch', 'season', 'understand', 'yet', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'explanation.Also', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'made', 'Scully', 'season', 'Where', 'X', 'files', 'discovers', 'real', 'truth', 'Yet', 'bring', 'wooden', 'guy', 'who', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'being', 'new', 'terminator', 'try', 'make', 'chemistry', 'happen', 'Well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'producers', 'etc', 'knew', 'chemistry', 'never', 'happened', 'season', 'felt', 'wrong.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'WRONG', 'were', 'so', 'good', 'episodes', 'series', 'fillers', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'good', 'should', 'have', 'paid', 'David', 'D.', 'serious', 'money', 'continue', 'went', 'ahead', 'lackluster', 'contribution.So', 'finale', 'contribution', 'X', 'files', 'worth', 'seeing', 'season', 'up', 'conclusion', 'season', 'seven', 'season', 'nine', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'season', 'nine', 'yet', 'believe', 'will', 'give', 'thoughts', 'when', 'see', 'decided', 'not', 'add', 'overview', 'seven', 'generally', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'true', 'X', 'files', 'season', 'just', 'thought', 'would', 'warn', 'season.Shannon']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season

Even though the best episodes of the 7th season can't compete the ones of the eight season, the worst episodes of the 7th season also can't compete the ones of the eight!!The worst episodes of the series will at least be mediocre, but watchable and &quot;traditional&quot; if I might say.Here are some of the negative aspects of the eight season:1. The atmosphere feels different than the usuall x-files episodes and it takes a while for the viewer to get accustomed to some of the changes and the abscence of Mulder.2. The pair of Doget-Scully can't compete with the great pair of Mulder and Scully and the jokes and black humor.3. Mulder is missed mostly because we don't hear his great lines and jokes.4. It seems that some of the episodes lack coherent construction in the story that result in mediocre episode.5. The concept of the x-files goes a bit further but I don't know if this is bad or not.6. Mulder dies....lives they went too far. There is an explanation of course but I believe that his death went beyone the limits and they should let him aside without killing him.So I go on with the good aspects of the series.1. The concept of the x-files expands and even though it is a bit far fetch. The concept of the conspiracy is very interesting and I hope that in the 9th season they will conclude this as they did with the sixth season.2 John Doget after the few first episodes gets a more active role and with the introduction of some new characters the series gets an interesting turn that doesn't allow the viewer to be bored.Having read many negative comments about this season I expected it to be far worse that it actually was. In no way can the series compete with the first 6 seasons but its also far better that the 7th season and its good to see the alien conspiracy story move on through the episodes.My only objection is that if they paid attention to some details such as the dialogues in some episodes which aren't given much consideration, and if they tried to make the episodes more &quot;logical&quot; and coherent this would be a surprising good series. Some details and mediocre episodes doesn't make the series that good.To conclude I could give the series five stars but I will have to wait and see how the 9th season goes and how it answers some questions raised here. If they wrap the story nice then this series gets 5 stars. If 9th season sucks and the whole cospiracy story isn't told the proper way then this one is for nothing.",4,Better than 7th season.

I still and always will love the seasons but something had to change. At the time when David D was about to bail, i took this as an immenent end. What a mistake.As  X files fans my better half and myself have been watching them all from beginning up until season 8. We were very suprised.  I can only recommend a strong buy for this series.  The new character played by Robert Patrick is, IMHO, a very suprise addition and a welcome one. He hit the ground running,so to speak, and as a credit to his acting ability, he fitted right in as the ex marine, straight as a dye, bluesuited FBI guy -- who was stuck in the basement.  Even David D bounced off him in a few scenes and it was fun to see and certainly Gillian A and himself were a good mix.The acting was a credit to all, the stories strong and competent, the direction excellent, and for a change the special effect looked better then something done in microsoft paint!

First there is a murder and then there is the scene and the things that are left behind. Of all of those are the trappings that look like the signs of some type of animal feeding, only an animal doesn't have a stride that tops that of a man and it doesn't ake off sets of fingers of leaves marks in wooden beams like something hanging upside down.This is one of the first Doggett episodes involving something monstrous, and it is one of the best ones that I had seen in quite some time. The thing in the story has the impact that it is supposed to have and more, with the way it is set up looking so much like a terror. The storyline also combines in a way that seems amazing, with the clues coming together with an amazing explanation and making this out to be something that is better than it sounds. Then there are the effects, with pieces of it being protesthetic and pieces being animated and some simply amounting to the way a person manages their positioning.I personally liked this season and I personally liked the season afterit. There is still a  Mulder presence here and a mixture of other agents, and skully pics up some of the slack with the explanations coming out of her. This shows just how much she has come to see, and how much she is fixed in the Mulder rationale.

Doggett's a firm disbeliever until some bizarre things occur during the first two episodes of the season. Robert Patrick brought much needed focus and energy to the eighth season. While the eighth season didn't match the highs of the best seasons of the show it had some strong outstanding episodes and it appeared after a wildly uneven 7th season that the show might actually be on track again. Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish)was introduced as a semi-regular during this season as well working in conjunction with Doggett and Scully.Among the outstanding episodes are one in which Doggett and Mulder check out a oil refingery rig that's pumping something other than oil, another stand out episode involves a tense one set in the deserted subway tunnels of Boston where something is literally dissolving passengers as they ride the rails. Doggett goes underground to investigate while Scully works against the clock to figure out if there's a biological contagion. The conclusion is disappointing but the episode itself is a tense 45 minutes.The 8th season saw a return to the spookier, darker episodes that made ""The X-Files"" a close cousin to ""The Night Stalker"", ""Trilogy of Terror"" and ""The Norliss Tapes"" (three terrific made-for-TV movies). There are those that argued that Patrick's Doggett wasn't as compelling as Mulder's character and I'd have to disagree--over the short two seasons that Patrick played Doggett he created a character every bit as memorable as Duchovny's Mulder and just as different.The 8th season reduced cost set has commentary tracks on ""Alone"" by Frank Spotnitz and by Kim Manners on ""Existence"". There are also a couple of episodes with deleted scenes that you can watch restored to the respective episodes via the main menu.

750108,AP3B615GM191G,B00008YGRY,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 2]","In the previous (seventh) season of the X-Files, the Mulder-Scully romantic relationship was cultivated by the writers/producers more than ever before.  Thus, as the eighth season dawned without Mulder (David Duchovny signed a limited contract with the show), the tension between Scully and new agent John Doggett (a ""by-the-book"" skeptic) is wonderful.  Let's quickly look at how that tension played into this season's episodes:Mythology: Unlike previous seasons, this season had many more mythology episodes than ever before.  As the season dawns, Scully is paired with Doggett, with their primary task being to determined the whereabouts of Mulder.  Once Mulder is found (dead or alive, I will not reveal) the mythological focus shifts towards a new sort of government/alien conspiracy...enhanced human beings (""Super Soldiers"") meant to pave the way for colonization.  While the added number of mythology episodes was exciting, the dramatic material often seemed a bit contrived.  The quandry the writers/producers found themselves in was that they did not know when the show would end.  Essentially airing on a season-by-season basis at this point, the mythos of the show was conflicted between providing answers to previously-asked questions and creating new material.Also present throughout the entire mythology of this season (and coming to a head in the two-part season finale) is Scully's mysterious pregnancy: Who is the father?  Is the baby ""normal""?Stand-Alone: After some sub-par stand-alone efforts in Season Seven, the addition of Doggett really livened up the stand-alones this season.  The tension between the now-believing Scully and the procedural Doggett is a great dramatic tool, as Scully must learn to not always ""think like Mulder"" while Doggett learns to take a few leaps of faith.  Only 1-2 ""clinker"" stand-alone episodes exist during this season.To conclude, the Eighth Season of the X-Files succeeds in breathing new life into a show that began showing its age in Season Seven.  Yet, as is true in most media efforts, nothing is as good as the original.  The witty Mulder-Scully banter is no more, no humorous episodes appear this season, and the mythology plotlines often do not jive with previously established material.  While not measuring up to previous seasons, this season still is a strong effort that contains many compelling hours of drama for X-Files fans.",4,New Character Refreshes Show,1212364800,"06 2, 2008",2008,2396,"['previous', 'seventh', 'season', 'X-Files', 'Mulder-Scully', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'was', 'cultivated', 'writers/producers', 'more', 'ever', 'Thus', 'eighth', 'season', 'dawned', 'Mulder', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'signed', 'limited', 'contract', 'show', 'tension', 'Scully', 'new', 'agent', 'John', 'Doggett', 'by-the-book', 'skeptic', 'wonderful', 'Let', 'quickly', 'look', 'how', 'tension', 'played', 'season', 'episodes', 'Mythology', 'previous', 'seasons', 'season', 'had', 'many', 'more', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'ever', 'before', 'season', 'dawns', 'Scully', 'paired', 'Doggett', 'primary', 'task', 'being', 'determined', 'whereabouts', 'Mulder', 'Once', 'Mulder', 'found', 'dead', 'alive', 'will', 'not', 'reveal', 'mythological', 'focus', 'shifts', 'towards', 'new', 'sort', 'government/alien', 'conspiracy', 'enhanced', 'human', 'beings', 'Super', 'Soldiers', 'meant', 'pave', 'way', 'colonization', 'added', 'number', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'was', 'exciting', 'dramatic', 'material', 'often', 'seemed', 'bit', 'contrived', 'quandry', 'writers/producers', 'found', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'when', 'show', 'would', 'end', 'Essentially', 'airing', 'season-by-season', 'basis', 'point', 'mythos', 'show', 'was', 'conflicted', 'providing', 'answers', 'previously-asked', 'questions', 'creating', 'new', 'material.Also', 'present', 'entire', 'mythology', 'season', 'coming', 'head', 'two-part', 'season', 'finale', 'Scully', 'mysterious', 'pregnancy', 'Who', 'father', 'baby', 'normal', 'Stand-Alone', 'sub-par', 'stand-alone', 'efforts', 'Season', 'Seven', 'addition', 'Doggett', 'really', 'livened', 'up', 'stand-alones', 'season', 'tension', 'now-believing', 'Scully', 'procedural', 'Doggett', 'great', 'dramatic', 'tool', 'Scully', 'must', 'learn', 'not', 'always', 'think', 'Mulder', 'Doggett', 'take', 'few', 'leaps', 'faith', 'Only', '1-2', 'clinker', 'stand-alone', 'episodes', 'exist', 'season.To', 'conclude', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'X-Files', 'breathing', 'new', 'life', 'show', 'began', 'showing', 'age', 'Season', 'Seven', 'Yet', 'true', 'most', 'media', 'efforts', 'nothing', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'witty', 'Mulder-Scully', 'banter', 'more', 'humorous', 'episodes', 'appear', 'season', 'mythology', 'plotlines', 'often', 'do', 'not', 'jive', 'previously', 'established', 'material', 'not', 'measuring', 'up', 'previous', 'seasons', 'season', 'still', 'strong', 'effort', 'many', 'compelling', 'hours', 'drama', 'X-Files', 'fans']",The X-Files - The Complete Eighth Season
