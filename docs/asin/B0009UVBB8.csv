913282,AYVSMST9W5XGL,B0009UVBB8,"Buddy's Master ""history buff""","[15, 16]",What a pleasure to finally have ELEANOR AND FRANKLIN: The Early Years on DVD. HBO has produced an excellent release by restoring the original color to the film and releasing it in Letterbox (was never seen in this format before). I always enjoyed the film based on the Lash book but was discouraged by TV showings of inferior copies with washed out picture frames and the VHS release not much better. You will not be sorry if you purchase this DVD. The price was reasonable. Don't understand why Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years was not released at the same time. Now I await BACKSTAIRS AT THE WHITE HOUSE on November 1. Hope these DVD's will be as excellent as the Roosevelt DVD's.,5,Hope White House Years is Close Behind,1125446400,"08 31, 2005",2005,693,"['What', 'pleasure', 'finally', 'have', 'ELEANOR', 'AND', 'FRANKLIN', 'Early', 'Years', 'DVD', 'HBO', 'produced', 'excellent', 'release', 'restoring', 'original', 'color', 'film', 'releasing', 'Letterbox', 'was', 'never', 'seen', 'format', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'based', 'Lash', 'book', 'was', 'discouraged', 'TV', 'showings', 'inferior', 'copies', 'washed', 'out', 'picture', 'frames', 'VHS', 'release', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'sorry', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'price', 'was', 'reasonable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'White', 'House', 'Years', 'was', 'not', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'Now', 'await', 'BACKSTAIRS', 'AT', 'THE', 'WHITE', 'HOUSE', 'November', '1', 'Hope', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'excellent', 'Roosevelt', 'DVD']",N/A

The acting was absolutely first rate, the sets well done and the music unforgettable. For years I looked for it on VHS format and more recently, DVD. I'm overjoyed that this wonderfully underrated film is finally available on DVD. Hip Hip Hooray!So many made-for-TV historical films are pure garbage in terms of accurate history. This movie does not make that mistake. The main characters are portrayed accurately, warts and all. Edward Herrman makes a great Roosevelt, perhaps the best fictional FDR we've ever experienced, including Ralph Bellamy. And Jane Alexander's Eleanor is flawless. She is cold, insecure and formal, yet possessing a hidden warmth and neediness exemplified by the actual Mrs. Roosevelt.For anyone interested in Presidential history or the relationship between FDR and Eleanor, this is essential viewing.

I thought it was wonderful as it showed the Roosevelts with all their faults.  They went over them but did not show their faults glaringly but enought to know that they weren't perfect and I appreciated that.  It's not like an American President is this perfect God-like person that cannot commit a sin.  It was tastefully done and it showed how they overcome those troubles and became what I consider to be better people out of it.  Any way, I have the VHS of this and have been eagerly waiting for the DVD to be produced.  Thanks again!

913285,A27T7FAONDX6VI,B0009UVBB8,"Chris ""Chris906""","[0, 0]","'Eleanor and Franklin - The Early Years' is a wonderful miniseries excellently acted by the principals Jane Alexander as Eleanor and Edward Hermann as FDR. 'The Early Years' is striking and uses wonderful on location photography of FDR's homes in Hyde Park, New York and Warm Springs, Georgia. The elliptical way the story is done in the first part is also well done. The funeral train of FDR is portrayed in a very historically accurate fashion and in flashbacks Eleanor remembers her tough childhood and her courtship by FDR.The story being based on Joseph Lash's Pulitzer Prize winning book 'Eleanor and Franklin' is told ,like the book, from Eleanor's perspective. I think the series does wonderfully in humanizing these larger than life characters. It handles the depiction of FDR's battle with Polio very well and in a moving fashion. Another performance of note is the late Ed Flanders excellent, funny portrayal of key FDR adviser Louis Howe. He really handles this juicy character role with aplomb in 'The Early Years'. Also worth mentioning is the evocative score by John Barry. The score sets the tone and mood of the story very well.The DVD has excellent picture and sound. The picture is really quite splendid for a TV miniseries from the '70s and the DVD has excellent color reproduction. There are also scene selections. The DVD does not contain any other extras which is a pity because I would have liked to have heard more from Jane Alexander and Edward Hermann on what is was like playing these amazing historical characters. Viewers left wanting more visual info is encouraged to obtain the DVD of the PBS American Experience episode on FDR from 1994.All viewers should try to visit some of the personal locations depicted in the miniseries if ever given the chance. Warm Springs, Georgia has the Little White House preserved and has a great museum. It is a must visit for any Presidential buff. Hyde Park, New York has the FDR presidential library and the big house preserved plus Eleanor's beloved residence Val-Kill and Campobello Island has excellently preserved the summer home the Roosevelts lived in for many years and is the house where Franklin had to suffer through his battle with the dreaded Polio disease. These places are amazing and make the real life stories come to life.I give the 'Eleanor and Franklin - The Early Years' an emphatic A+++Highly recommended!",5,Excellent Miniseries!

913286,A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,B0009UVBB8,"E. A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","When most people think of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, they usually think of an older man crippled by polio and his unattractive but intelligent wife.But ""Eleanor & Franklin - The Early Years"" attempts to address the years before the Roosevelts came to the White House -- how they met, why they married, and the kind of relationship that formed between them. The title is a bit of a misnomer, but it's a valuable and well-written TV movie that gives us a glimpse into the formative years of a very important First Lady.Eleanor Roosevelt was something of an ugly duckling in the wealthy, influential Roosevelt family -- she was the goddaughter/niece of future president Theodore Roosevelt, but she wasn't pretty and outgoing like his daughter Alice. Instead, she was a studious, clever, sober young woman who preferred bettering society to being a social butterfly -- especially since her repressive grandmother kept her as sheltered as possible.At a family reunion, the teenage Eleanor (Mackenzie Phillips) immediately clicked with her dashing cousin Franklin (Ted Eccles), but their friendship was put on hold because of school. She was sent to Allenswood Academy in England, while he went on to Harvard.But when she got back to the US, Franklin (Edward Herrmann) and Eleanor (Jane Alexander) immediately hit it off, forming a deep friendship that began to evolve into love. But they did have an obstacle in their way: Franklin's overbearing, smothering mother, who is determined to maintain her iron-fisted control over her son's entire life.""Eleanor & Franklin - The Early Years"" is a bit of a misnomer -- it's actually about 80% about Eleanor, and 20% about Eleanor AND Franklin. Franklin's childhood and formative years are only lightly touched on, while we get LOTS of details about Eleanor's education, relationships, and how her friendship with Franklin evolved as he gained respect for her.The story takes place in a whirl of Gilded Age splendor, old money, carriages, sumptuous parties and elegant mansions; one of the few flaws is that we don't get to see Eleanor working with the impoverished (she just TALKS about it). The story of Franklin and Eleanor's eccentric courtship unfolds slowly, but is peppered with charmingly offbeat moments -- such as Franklin serenading Eleanor with a ukelele, or their combative marriage proposal.Jane Alexander is absolutely pitch-perfect as a young Eleanor Roosevelt -- she even sort of looks like her, and she gives a pleasantly awkward performance as a young woman who is a square peg in a society of round holes. And the movie shows a lot of the forces that helped shape Eleanor into the woman she became -- a sprightly French headmistress, her boisterous uncle Teddy, and her own love for helping others.Hermann takes a somewhat secondary role until the last act, but he also gives a brilliant performance -- you can see that without Eleanor's influence, he might have been just been bastion of the Old Guard and lived a comfortable but stifling life. But with her influence, he is inspired.""Eleanor & Franklin - The Early Years"" has a lot more Eleanor than Franklin, but it's a nuanced, well-written movie that gives you some valuable insights into this famous First Couple.",5,Early years of a First Couple,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,3231,"['When', 'most', 'people', 'think', 'Franklin', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'usually', 'think', 'older', 'man', 'crippled', 'polio', 'unattractive', 'intelligent', 'wife.But', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'Early', 'Years', 'attempts', 'address', 'years', 'Roosevelts', 'came', 'White', 'House', 'how', 'met', 'why', 'married', 'kind', 'relationship', 'formed', 'title', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'valuable', 'well-written', 'TV', 'movie', 'glimpse', 'formative', 'years', 'very', 'important', 'First', 'Lady.Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'was', 'something', 'ugly', 'duckling', 'wealthy', 'influential', 'Roosevelt', 'family', 'was', 'goddaughter/niece', 'future', 'president', 'Theodore', 'Roosevelt', 'was', ""n't"", 'pretty', 'outgoing', 'daughter', 'Alice', 'Instead', 'was', 'studious', 'clever', 'sober', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'preferred', 'bettering', 'society', 'being', 'social', 'butterfly', 'especially', 'repressive', 'grandmother', 'kept', 'as', 'sheltered', 'possible.At', 'family', 'reunion', 'teenage', 'Eleanor', 'Mackenzie', 'Phillips', 'immediately', 'clicked', 'dashing', 'cousin', 'Franklin', 'Ted', 'Eccles', 'friendship', 'was', 'put', 'hold', 'school', 'was', 'sent', 'Allenswood', 'Academy', 'England', 'went', 'Harvard.But', 'when', 'got', 'back', 'US', 'Franklin', 'Edward', 'Herrmann', 'Eleanor', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'immediately', 'hit', 'off', 'forming', 'deep', 'friendship', 'began', 'evolve', 'love', 'did', 'have', 'obstacle', 'way', 'Franklin', 'overbearing', 'smothering', 'mother', 'who', 'determined', 'maintain', 'iron-fisted', 'control', 'son', 'entire', 'life', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'Early', 'Years', 'bit', 'misnomer', 'actually', 'about', '80', '%', 'Eleanor', '20', '%', 'Eleanor', 'AND', 'Franklin', 'Franklin', 'childhood', 'formative', 'years', 'are', 'only', 'lightly', 'touched', 'get', 'LOTS', 'details', 'Eleanor', 'education', 'relationships', 'how', 'friendship', 'Franklin', 'evolved', 'gained', 'respect', 'her.The', 'story', 'place', 'whirl', 'Gilded', 'Age', 'splendor', 'old', 'money', 'carriages', 'sumptuous', 'parties', 'elegant', 'mansions', 'one', 'few', 'flaws', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'Eleanor', 'working', 'impoverished', 'just', 'TALKS', 'story', 'Franklin', 'Eleanor', 'eccentric', 'courtship', 'unfolds', 'slowly', 'peppered', 'charmingly', 'offbeat', 'moments', 'such', 'Franklin', 'serenading', 'Eleanor', 'ukelele', 'combative', 'marriage', 'proposal.Jane', 'Alexander', 'absolutely', 'pitch-perfect', 'young', 'Eleanor', 'Roosevelt', 'even', 'sort', 'looks', 'pleasantly', 'awkward', 'performance', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'square', 'peg', 'society', 'round', 'holes', 'movie', 'lot', 'forces', 'helped', 'shape', 'Eleanor', 'woman', 'became', 'sprightly', 'French', 'headmistress', 'boisterous', 'uncle', 'Teddy', 'own', 'love', 'helping', 'others.Hermann', 'somewhat', 'secondary', 'role', 'last', 'act', 'also', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'can', 'see', 'Eleanor', 'influence', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'been', 'bastion', 'Old', 'Guard', 'lived', 'comfortable', 'stifling', 'life', 'influence', 'inspired', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'Early', 'Years', 'lot', 'more', 'Eleanor', 'Franklin', 'nuanced', 'well-written', 'movie', 'valuable', 'insights', 'famous', 'First', 'Couple']",N/A

913288,AUW1K6KBIG17A,B0009UVBB8,Hawkeye,"[6, 7]","I have been waiting for this on DVD for years!  I first saw this on the history channel during a re-broadcast in the 90's.  I really enjoyed that broadcast because it included an interview with an historian/biographer of Eleanor Roosevelt.  I remember that she had confirmed that this mini-series was very good history (in other words, historically accurate and true to known facts).I appreciated knowing that as I watched the show, because it seems to me to be pointless to put together a production based on actual people if the most fundamental story line is fiction or ""fictionalized"" (i.e., ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""Pearl Harbor"", not to mention practically every World War II movie other than ""Tora Tora Tora"", which take far too many liberties with the facts).With that little bit of information tucked away, I was able to enjoy the performances in Eleanor & Franklin even more, for they really took me back into time.  Words escape me as I try to express just how much an impact this had on me.  It gave me a new appreciation for the humanity of Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt (both tragic and triumphant), that just isn't captured in the brief accounts in the history books of our schools.I highly recommend this mini-series.  I just ordered the DVD a few moments ago, so I can not yet speak as to the quality of this particular release.  I am not even sure if it is the complete ""Early Years"" (starting with eleanor's childhood) - I certainly hope that it is.I would also like to thank the reviewer who mentioned ""Backstairs of the White House"".  I haven't seen that mini-series since it was originally aired.  I remember that it was extraordinary.  I certainly plan to purchase that on DVD when it is released.And finally, let me add my voice to those calling for the release of ""The White House Years"" on DVD ASAP!

The description talks about the second half produced in 1977! These types of mistakes can be very misleading to anyone purchasing this DVD. But, beyond that this is one of the great miniseries of the 70's. There were many great and timeless classics made during those years and this has always been at the top of my list. Jane Alexander is the perfect Eleanor and Edward Herrmann playing FDR is only second to Ralph Belamy's portrayal, but also great and very effective.
