Even the most devoted fans might be shocked or even offended by what they see on this 60 minute film about the controversial band's ""Antichrist Superstar"" concert tour. In the first 5 minutes of the video, you'll see footage of christians singing gospel hymns & witnessing to Manson fans outside of the arenas before the concerts. As an atheist, I bursted out laughing at the lengths that these christians went to just to get their message across to all of the Manson fans. Singing, dancing, praying, preaching from the bible, holding signs that say ""Manson, Jesus Loves You"" and stuff like that, it was just funny. Then the cameras take us inside the arena as Manson appears on stage to kick things off by singing ""The Angel With the Scabbed Wings."" Manson is interviewed throughout the program and explains why he hates christianity so much and how he feels when religious people attack him & refuse to let their children come to see him perform. There's a lot of blurred faces and disguised voices on this tape, and can be a bit annoying. Even Manson's voice during some of the interviews sounds audibly crasp, but if you've got good hearing, you should be able to make out what he's saying. Other live songs include Kinderfield, Sweet Dreams, Antichrist Superstar, Lunchbox, and Apple of Sodom, which I consider to be my favorite song on the video. Also, you'll see clips of Manson performing 1996 and Rock 'n' Roll N*****. Manson is a very outspoken speaker and exercises it by giving some interesting speeches at various concerts. A lot of the backstage footage is rather tasteless & very shocking, so don't watch this tape if you're easily offended. Don't say I didn't warn you!

I kept waiting for there to be like some meat to the film, to tie all the loose ends together, but it never happened. When manson was interviewed the sound quality ...., and all through out the movie the camera jumped around far too much. When they were backstage with the band, I would start to look at one of the members and check out his make up and hair and all and then the camera would turn away, I was like, geezus, give me a second. it was irritating. One awesome freaky thing though, was when Manson came out on stilts to sing""Kinderfeld,"" that was great. I basically expected more from this film because of all the hype it got from all of you, I don't understand it, God Is In The Tv was a much much much better choice, which I do own and watch frequently.
