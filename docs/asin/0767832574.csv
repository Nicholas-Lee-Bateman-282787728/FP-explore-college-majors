I've seen this movie twice and loved it both times. I'll even go further: Harvey makes me believe he's Elvis by the end of the movie!  I think he's either a ghost Elvis or an angel Elvis but he is Elvis.  His mission is to hitch a ride toward Memphis with troubled souls and heal them by the magic of being Elvis returned.  He succeeds in every assignment.  He had to not look like Elvis because that would have made the person's faith too easy to gain.  The test of faith, of course, is in believing in the preposterous.  Harvey also does a knockout rendition of singing as Elvis onstage while wearing a blue studded jumpsuit.  I am not really a big fan of Elvis but he interests me as the folk hero he has apparently become in the USA.  This role is utterly in keeping with the urban legends floating around now about Elvis.  Everyone else in the film supports the Elvis character and is primarily important for doing so.  They do a good job but it is Harvey Keitel's movie all the way.  I've followed him since the beginning of his career and he has really carved out the best of that career being and playing a middle-aged man instead of a young one.",5,"Harvey Keitel , At His Very Best,  Is Elvis!",978998400,"01 9, 2001",2001,1248,"['Ok', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Harvey', ""'m"", 'saying', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'know', 'not', 'everyone', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'loved', 'times', ""'ll"", 'even', 'go', 'further', 'Harvey', 'believe', 'Elvis', 'end', 'movie', 'think', 'ghost', 'Elvis', 'angel', 'Elvis', 'Elvis', 'mission', 'hitch', 'ride', 'Memphis', 'troubled', 'souls', 'heal', 'magic', 'being', 'Elvis', 'returned', 'assignment', 'had', 'not', 'look', 'Elvis', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'person', 'faith', 'too', 'easy', 'gain', 'test', 'faith', 'course', 'believing', 'preposterous', 'Harvey', 'also', 'knockout', 'rendition', 'singing', 'Elvis', 'onstage', 'wearing', 'blue', 'studded', 'jumpsuit', 'am', 'not', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'Elvis', 'interests', 'folk', 'hero', 'apparently', 'become', 'USA', 'role', 'utterly', 'keeping', 'urban', 'legends', 'floating', 'around', 'now', 'Elvis', 'Everyone', 'else', 'film', 'Elvis', 'character', 'primarily', 'important', 'doing', 'so', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'movie', 'way', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'beginning', 'career', 'really', 'carved', 'out', 'best', 'career', 'being', 'playing', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'instead', 'young', 'one']",N/A

It's just that movies today are so cynical, it's refreshing to see a movie about overcoming demons instead of indulging them. A hitchhiker who calls himself Elvis (Harvey Keitel) meets a traveler  (Schaech) who reluctantly gives him a ride. Despite many rejections, the  two  develop a kind of odd friendship. They look out for each other.  Schaech is morning the loss of his wife in a car accident, when he meets a  Maralyn Monroe impersonator (Bridget Fonda) who is part of a lounge act at  a casino on their journey to Memphis. The real fun of this movie is  Keitel's performance. No matter what the role, he always gives you  something of interest. He doesn't look like Elvis, he doesn't really talk  like Elvis, and there is a definite question as to if Elvis would ever act  like this; but it is fun. Schaech is a good straight man, and Fonda gives  us more reasons to daydream about meeting her.

Here, that acting,  is combinedwith the musical legacy of Elvis Presley.First, this road movie manages to hold view attention over 90minutes, but to justice to the movie, and its powerful impact, thecontent of the story deserves to be learned when seen, not fromahead of time, obviously.So, HK and Bridget Fonda form part of the ""tribute band"" scene, orin other words, they play the music of former legends in the movieand music business, knowing  how to act, know well the biographies,how to present themselves in all aspects (dress,  hair style,makeup, mannerisms, etc.) e.g. Elvis and Marilyn Monroe (NormaJean) and Elvis, etc.The actors do a fine job in not only that tribute aspect, but alsoin relating to the audience, and between themselves, in a natural,colloquial, relaxed style.Actor Johnathon Schaech  ( reminiscent of Martin Landau ), plays ayoung  man, who seems to be walking in the shoes of Harvey Keitel'scharacter to some extent. A very meaningful aspect related, is howsometimes, one is stuck living in his or her past, never evolvingor growing out of,  or reaching beyond a personal tragedy from anearlier point in life;  not unless, that is,  a generous person,highly skilled from a human capacity, is able to  articulate thepsychological mechanisms of that individual, that are held inside,make them move,  allowing the person to get back on their feet.This is more easily said than done, and why his work deserves to beseen.The music is very effective, and tastefully measured at variouspoints in the movie. The filming, and the editing are spotless.The work also explores ""Americana"" or in other words, Americanculture and the reality that the legacy of Elvis is maintainedtoday, touching the hearts and minds of all generations.Overall, this DVD is a keeper, and has replay value for the music,the acting, the story, the emotions, the ambience, and theimaginary aspects all rolled into one.",4,"Explores ""Americana"", very effective, well measures in many aspects",1360972800,"02 16, 2013",2013,2137,"['Finding', 'Graceland', '1998', 'movie', 'starring', 'Harvey', 'Keitel', 'assuch', 'kind', 'guarantee', 'project', 'quality', 'actorknown', 'selecting', 'original', 'projects', 'having', 'meaning', 'andsomething', 'remarkable', 'viewers', 'Here', 'acting', 'combinedwith', 'musical', 'legacy', 'Elvis', 'Presley.First', 'road', 'movie', 'hold', 'view', 'attention', '90minutes', 'justice', 'movie', 'powerful', 'impact', 'thecontent', 'story', 'be', 'learned', 'when', 'seen', 'not', 'fromahead', 'time', 'obviously.So', 'HK', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'form', 'part', 'tribute', 'band', 'scene', 'other', 'words', 'play', 'music', 'former', 'legends', 'movieand', 'music', 'business', 'knowing', 'how', 'act', 'know', 'well', 'biographies', 'how', 'present', 'aspects', 'dress', 'hair', 'style', 'makeup', 'mannerisms', 'etc', 'e.g', 'Elvis', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'NormaJean', 'Elvis', 'etc.The', 'actors', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'not', 'only', 'tribute', 'aspect', 'alsoin', 'relating', 'audience', 'natural', 'colloquial', 'relaxed', 'style.Actor', 'Johnathon', 'Schaech', 'reminiscent', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'ayoung', 'man', 'who', 'be', 'walking', 'shoes', 'Harvey', ""Keitel'scharacter"", 'extent', 'very', 'meaningful', 'aspect', 'related', 'howsometimes', 'one', 'stuck', 'living', 'past', 'never', 'evolvingor', 'growing', 'reaching', 'personal', 'tragedy', 'anearlier', 'point', 'life', 'not', 'generous', 'person', 'highly', 'skilled', 'human', 'capacity', 'able', 'articulate', 'thepsychological', 'mechanisms', 'individual', 'are', 'held', 'inside', 'make', 'move', 'allowing', 'person', 'get', 'back', 'feet.This', 'more', 'easily', 'said', 'done', 'why', 'work', 'beseen.The', 'music', 'very', 'effective', 'tastefully', 'measured', 'variouspoints', 'movie', 'filming', 'editing', 'are', 'spotless.The', 'work', 'also', 'Americana', 'other', 'words', 'Americanculture', 'reality', 'legacy', 'Elvis', 'maintainedtoday', 'touching', 'hearts', 'minds', 'generations.Overall', 'DVD', 'keeper', 'replay', 'value', 'music', 'acting', 'story', 'emotions', 'ambience', 'theimaginary', 'aspects', 'rolled', 'one']",N/A

They can't all be blockbusters.Harvey Keitel as &quot;Elvis&quot; only goes to show the genius of Keitel the actor and the man. The exterior of Keitel's character believes he's Elvis up to a point, the interior knows there is something spiritual inhabiting his very being. That spirit could very well be the real spirit of Elvis who has come back to earth to right a few wrongs and continue to change lives.Keitel was never meant to look, talk, act, or sing like Elvis. That's the beauty of it all. Where Keitel becomes Elvis is how he interacts with the people he meets and leaves them uplifted.Bridget Fonda plays a sweet young woman who impersonates Marilyn Monroe for a living, mostly in Vegas, but sometimes traveling around the casino circuit. At Robinsonville, Mississippi's Hollywood Casino (yes, these places are real), she meets Keitel and the emotionally shattered Johnathon Schaech, still mourning the death of his young wife from a year ago.Eventually, all make it to Memphis only a few miles from the Hollywood Casino where the spirit of Elvis also lives in his home and grounds known as Graceland. This is a film authorized by the Presley Estate, so the viewer will get to see the real interior of Graceland from angles that tourists don't get to see.This movie will make most viewers laugh and cry. There's a little something here for everyone. In fact you don't even have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy this film.

When his wife takes her eys of the road to kiss him, she runs into a train, killing her (Gretchen Mol). But Byron manages to still be alive.So it's about a year, Byron felling guilt about his wife's death, decides to vist Graceland (I guess). On the way, he picks up a hitchhicker who cliams to be the late Elvis Presley. His name is Elvis (Harvey Keitel).Byron doesn't believe he is Elvis. And why should he? During the trip, Byron meets an Marliyn Monroe impersonator (Bridget Fonda). It is almost August 16th (the day that Elvis Presley died).Harvey Keitel looks nothing like Elvis. Harvey Keitel needs to get a hair cut. In fact, Harvey Keitel should have been dumped from the movie, and somebody who does look like Elvis should have been hired. If your an Elvis Presley fan, and you can't be able to make it to to Graceland, your next bet is to stay home and watch this movie.My thoughts on Finding Graceland: I would reccomend this film to you if you are an Elvis Presley fan, or a fan of the cast. I will also reccomend this movie if you are to young to see 3000 Miles to Graceland. Or if you have seen 3000 Miles to Graceland and hated the movie. The movie was rated PG-13. And I would reccomend to you to get this movie if you love to get movies on dvd with deleted scenes or outtakes. And if my memory is correct, there are only 2 deleted scenes. I also will reccomend this film to you if you have seen 3000 Miles to Graceland and was disappointed because 3000 Miles to Graceland only had 3 Elvis songs.

It surprized me with it's creative take on a very pausible drama of human lives intertwined at key times that influence their destiny. Harvey was awesome and perfect in his role as Elvis, and at times, I indeed wondered if he was the real deal, choosing to fake his death and trading his fame, which had become his prison, for a life of freedom and exhibiting random acts of kindness in the process. What I have learned the Elvis Presley over the years, such a choice of life path would not necessarily be out of character. The Marilyn Monroe character in this film was also quite endearing, and can only long for a happy continuation of the spark begun in the casino between her and the distracted and heartbroken driver of the demolished caddilac.
