793726,A2SWW3OWEGLN2O,B00015HXCW,Andrew Kear,"[0, 0]","When you look at the magnificent works created during the Medici's reign in Florence, it is hard to believe the amount of violent political and religious turmoil going on in the background. As the Medici struggled for power, they used the art from greatest artists, like Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Botticelli to gain favor with the people. They not only appreciated fine art work, but were also skillful politicians.Since there was no way for individual artists back then to sell their paintings in a gallery, they become patrons to the Medici family. The Medicis where very generous to these artists, but they could be equally vindictive to their enemies. This was actually quite a bloody time in Florentine history, and there were sometimes violent fights for power among the top Florentine families. In many ways these families operated in much the same way the mafia does today. This docudrama has many colorful bloody scenes that would be home in the Godfathers film. I should mention that the color cinematography is superb, and excellent recreations of past events make this production quite believable.  There is no hiding the fact that the Renaissance was a very violent time in history.The film also points out this was a time when Religion and Science clashed. Unlike many in the church, the Medici were more interested in enlightenment and science, and a clash with the church was inevitable. Also the Medici had to contend with Martin Luther, who started the protestant revolt against the Catholic Church.While watching this film, I realized that the Medici was involved in just about every major event during the Renaissance.  Perhaps the greatest thinker the Medici discovered was Galileo, who discovered that the Earth revolved around the Sun. The Church thought some of Galileo's ideas where heresy and the Medici once again had to choose between their own beliefs and that of the church. Unfortunately, this time politics won and Galileo was confined to house arrest in his villa. Even the Medici had limited power when pitted against the church. Despite a few setback like this, the Medici truly were the Godfathers of the Renaissance",5,Excellent Drama and teaching tool,1323043200,"12 5, 2011",2011,2154,"['When', 'look', 'magnificent', 'created', 'Medici', 'reign', 'Florence', 'hard', 'believe', 'amount', 'violent', 'political', 'religious', 'turmoil', 'going', 'background', 'Medici', 'struggled', 'power', 'used', 'art', 'greatest', 'artists', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'Michelangelo', 'Botticelli', 'gain', 'favor', 'people', 'not', 'only', 'appreciated', 'fine', 'art', 'work', 'were', 'also', 'skillful', 'politicians.Since', 'was', 'way', 'individual', 'artists', 'back', 'then', 'sell', 'paintings', 'gallery', 'become', 'patrons', 'Medici', 'family', 'Medicis', 'where', 'very', 'generous', 'artists', 'could', 'be', 'equally', 'vindictive', 'enemies', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'bloody', 'time', 'Florentine', 'history', 'were', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'fights', 'power', 'top', 'Florentine', 'families', 'many', 'ways', 'families', 'operated', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'mafia', 'today', 'docudrama', 'many', 'colorful', 'bloody', 'scenes', 'would', 'be', 'home', 'Godfathers', 'film', 'should', 'mention', 'color', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'excellent', 'recreations', 'past', 'events', 'make', 'production', 'quite', 'believable', 'hiding', 'fact', 'Renaissance', 'was', 'very', 'violent', 'time', 'history.The', 'film', 'also', 'out', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'Religion', 'Science', 'clashed', 'many', 'church', 'Medici', 'were', 'more', 'interested', 'enlightenment', 'science', 'clash', 'church', 'was', 'inevitable', 'Also', 'Medici', 'had', 'contend', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'who', 'started', 'protestant', 'revolt', 'Catholic', 'Church.While', 'watching', 'film', 'realized', 'Medici', 'was', 'involved', 'just', 'major', 'event', 'Renaissance', 'Perhaps', 'greatest', 'thinker', 'Medici', 'discovered', 'was', 'Galileo', 'who', 'discovered', 'Earth', 'revolved', 'Sun', 'Church', 'thought', 'Galileo', 'ideas', 'where', 'heresy', 'Medici', 'once', 'again', 'had', 'choose', 'own', 'beliefs', 'church', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'politics', 'won', 'Galileo', 'was', 'confined', 'house', 'arrest', 'villa', 'Even', 'Medici', 'had', 'limited', 'power', 'when', 'pitted', 'church', 'few', 'setback', 'Medici', 'were', 'Godfathers', 'Renaissance']",N/A

To the extent that the activities of Michelangelo, Da Vinci, and others were either influenced or directly bankrolled by this rich Florentine family, the series does hold together.But what disappointed me was that the series seemed a bit skimpy on hard, good information about the Medicis, instead happily digressing into areas that supposedly were not the chief concern of the film.  There are extensive detours into architecture, art, religion, sculpture, etc.  Not that this is unwelcome:  it's just that the title of the DVD seems to promise something else entirely.Another annoying thing is that the entire narration is read in a kind of ""Tales of the Crypt""-type intonation that gets old really fast, and cannot handle the range of emotion and analysis that the documentary calls for.The film alternates between interviews with historians and scenes with costumed actors and a voiceover.One thing I did like was the extended visualization of Brunelleschi's creation of his beloved duomo.  This was a welcome experience, although much of the analysis (i.e., the details about the dome's construction) is only tangentially related to the Medicis.I should also warn you it's quite bloody.",3,passable,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,1715,"['Look', 'got', 'ta', 'admit', 'ai', ""n't"", 'many', 'DVDs', 'Medicis', 'there', 'how', 'can', 'gripe', 'Unfortunately', 'am', 'tempted', 'quip', 'still', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'there', 'Medicis', 'offering', 'largely', 'concerned', 'other', 'things.True', 'subject', 'matter', 'four', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'structured', 'broad', 'happenings', 'Medici', 'family', 'really', 'just', 'springboard', 'series', 'larger', 'concern', 'Renaissance', 'how', 'signaled', 'beginning', 'modern', 'world', 'extent', 'activities', 'Michelangelo', 'Da', 'Vinci', 'others', 'were', 'either', 'influenced', 'directly', 'bankrolled', 'rich', 'Florentine', 'family', 'series', 'hold', 'together.But', 'what', 'disappointed', 'was', 'series', 'seemed', 'bit', 'skimpy', 'hard', 'good', 'information', 'Medicis', 'instead', 'happily', 'digressing', 'areas', 'supposedly', 'were', 'not', 'chief', 'concern', 'film', 'are', 'extensive', 'detours', 'architecture', 'art', 'religion', 'sculpture', 'etc', 'Not', 'unwelcome', 'just', 'title', 'DVD', 'promise', 'something', 'else', 'entirely.Another', 'annoying', 'thing', 'entire', 'narration', 'read', 'kind', 'Tales', 'Crypt', '-type', 'intonation', 'old', 'really', 'fast', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'range', 'emotion', 'analysis', 'documentary', 'for.The', 'film', 'alternates', 'interviews', 'historians', 'scenes', 'costumed', 'actors', 'voiceover.One', 'thing', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'extended', 'visualization', 'Brunelleschi', 'creation', 'beloved', 'duomo', 'was', 'welcome', 'experience', 'much', 'analysis', 'i.e.', 'details', 'dome', 'construction', 'only', 'tangentially', 'related', 'Medicis.I', 'should', 'also', 'warn', 'quite', 'bloody']",N/A

793732,A2H3TGP5WIJNHK,B00015HXCW,"Center Man ""centerman@aol.com""","[165, 169]","This four-hour documentary on the Medici has all of the series' strengths (high production values, excellent cinematography) and its great weakness of substituting simple conflict for historical analysis.  You might get weary, as I did, of the implicit comparisons of the Renaissance banking family with the Coreleones, but that's relieved by a truly diverse selection of talking heads and viewpoints.There are other problems, though.  Nearly every entry in the &quot;Empires&quot; series has had difficulties with characterization, and &quot;The Medici&quot; is no different.  Lorenzo de Medici, for example, is portrayed as an enlightened ruler, a public-minded human being and an art patron whose career was sabotaged by religious fundamentalism. You'd never know he covered his debts by stealing from the public treasury. Savonarola is accurately depicted as a puritanical maniac, but his appeal to Florence is never fully explained. One minute the Florentines are sipping grapa and discussing Platonic forms, the next they're tossing their copies of &quot;The Republic&quot; on a bonfire.  For &quot;The Medici,&quot; it's enough to show Lorenzo as a patron of learning, and Savonarola as a fundamentalist, creating a black and white conflict that dehumanizes both and makes a mockery of the competing and often contradicting strains of piety and humanism found in many Renaissance figures.  It also makes ordinary Florentines look like dupes: Savonarola was a fanatic, but his Puritanical, anti-Medici sermons had resonance with a city that was tiring of Lorenzo's abuses.The third episode on the Medici popes moves in a similar direction.  This is the weakest of the bunch. The narrative is little more than a society-page list of parties and paintings, mixed with random acts of violence and a barebones timeline of the two pontiffs' lives.  Intervals with Michelangelo are enjoyable, but brief.  And the series again simplifies the protagonists.  Leo and Clement were wastrels whose excesses helped spark the Reformation.  They lived large and often led their armies into impious war.  That's all correct.  But if Leo X lived it up, he was also sincerely religious.  He wasn't unique, either: Many medieval and early Renaissance rulers saw no conflict between hedonism and piety.  Given the chance to explore this odd trait, &quot;Empires&quot; shies away and opts for scenes of Leo killing off his enemies.The documentary is worth a purchase, though.  The first episode on Cosimo de Medici is one of the best explorations of Renaissance politics I've seen on television, and Brunelleschi is given his due in both raising his dome and inventing perspective.  If Cosimo's failings are passed over, the overall assessment of his rule is fair.  One wishes the film would point out that common families like the Medici rose to power because the Florentines abolished feudalism in 1290, but that's a minor nit to pick.To be fair to the filmmakers, you can't fit everything about the family in a four-hour documentary, and &quot;The Medici,&quot; at least, hits the basics and doesn't get anything wrong (unlike Empires' &quot;Martin Luther,&quot; which told us the faith is a Freudian rejection of father figures).  This is probably the best treatment of Renaissance politics television will ever come up with, so you might as well seek it out, and hope the next &quot;Empires&quot; film fixes the flaws of its predecessors.",3,Better than average &quot;Empires&quot; entry,1078099200,"03 1, 2004",2004,3428,"['four-hour', 'documentary', 'Medici', 'series', 'strengths', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'excellent', 'cinematography', 'great', 'weakness', 'substituting', 'simple', 'conflict', 'historical', 'analysis', 'might', 'get', 'weary', 'did', 'implicit', 'comparisons', 'Renaissance', 'banking', 'family', 'Coreleones', 'relieved', 'truly', 'diverse', 'selection', 'talking', 'heads', 'viewpoints.There', 'are', 'other', 'problems', 'though', 'Nearly', 'entry', 'quot', 'Empires', 'quot', 'series', 'had', 'difficulties', 'characterization', 'quot', 'Medici', 'quot', 'different', 'Lorenzo', 'Medici', 'example', 'portrayed', 'enlightened', 'ruler', 'public-minded', 'human', 'being', 'art', 'patron', 'career', 'was', 'sabotaged', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', ""'d"", 'never', 'know', 'covered', 'debts', 'stealing', 'public', 'treasury', 'Savonarola', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'puritanical', 'maniac', 'appeal', 'Florence', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'One', 'minute', 'Florentines', 'are', 'sipping', 'grapa', 'discussing', 'Platonic', 'forms', 'next', ""'re"", 'tossing', 'copies', 'quot', 'Republic', 'quot', 'bonfire', 'quot', 'Medici', 'quot', 'enough', 'show', 'Lorenzo', 'patron', 'learning', 'Savonarola', 'fundamentalist', 'creating', 'black', 'white', 'conflict', 'mockery', 'competing', 'often', 'contradicting', 'strains', 'piety', 'humanism', 'found', 'many', 'Renaissance', 'figures', 'also', 'ordinary', 'Florentines', 'look', 'dupes', 'Savonarola', 'was', 'fanatic', 'Puritanical', 'anti-Medici', 'sermons', 'had', 'resonance', 'city', 'was', 'tiring', 'Lorenzo', 'abuses.The', 'third', 'episode', 'Medici', 'moves', 'similar', 'direction', 'weakest', 'bunch', 'narrative', 'little', 'more', 'society-page', 'list', 'parties', 'paintings', 'mixed', 'random', 'acts', 'violence', 'barebones', 'timeline', 'two', 'pontiffs', 'lives', 'Intervals', 'Michelangelo', 'are', 'enjoyable', 'brief', 'series', 'again', 'protagonists', 'Leo', 'Clement', 'were', 'wastrels', 'excesses', 'helped', 'spark', 'Reformation', 'lived', 'large', 'often', 'led', 'armies', 'impious', 'war', 'correct', 'Leo', 'X', 'lived', 'up', 'was', 'also', 'sincerely', 'religious', 'was', ""n't"", 'unique', 'Many', 'medieval', 'early', 'Renaissance', 'rulers', 'saw', 'conflict', 'hedonism', 'piety', 'Given', 'chance', 'explore', 'odd', 'trait', 'quot', 'Empires', 'quot', 'away', 'opts', 'scenes', 'Leo', 'killing', 'off', 'enemies.The', 'documentary', 'purchase', 'though', 'first', 'episode', 'Cosimo', 'de', 'Medici', 'one', 'best', 'explorations', 'Renaissance', 'politics', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'television', 'Brunelleschi', 'given', 'due', 'raising', 'dome', 'inventing', 'perspective', 'Cosimo', 'failings', 'are', 'passed', 'overall', 'assessment', 'rule', 'fair', 'One', 'film', 'would', 'point', 'out', 'common', 'families', 'Medici', 'rose', 'power', 'Florentines', 'abolished', 'feudalism', '1290', 'minor', 'nit', 'pick.To', 'be', 'fair', 'filmmakers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', 'everything', 'family', 'four-hour', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Medici', 'quot', 'least', 'basics', ""n't"", 'get', 'anything', 'wrong', 'Empires', 'quot', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'quot', 'told', 'faith', 'Freudian', 'rejection', 'father', 'figures', 'probably', 'best', 'treatment', 'Renaissance', 'politics', 'television', 'will', 'ever', 'come', 'up', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'seek', 'out', 'hope', 'next', 'quot', 'Empires', 'quot', 'film', 'fixes', 'flaws', 'predecessors']",N/A

Anyone hoping to come away with a clear historical picture of the Medici family is out of luck.  The narrative at times skips over entire generations and leaves the viewer with a somewhat blurry timeline, as though the producers had to edit the larger story in order to deal with time constraints.  Fair enough --- nearly every producer in television has to deal with time constraints and something always has to be left out.  However, when one watches this program & sees the time lavished on Brunelleschi & his dome (or on Michelangelo's ""David"" and ""The Last Judgement""), one can be left feeling impatient with the rather slipshod treatment of history.  Really, is their patronage of the arts the only reason that the Medici are important?  One is left with that impression from this series.Echoing other reviewers, I found the chapter on the Medici Popes to be particularly lacking in detail.  All one sees is parties, parties, parties.  Is that all these Popes did?  Clement VII, among other things, excommunicated Henry VIII of England for divorcing Catherine of Aragon (we all know what happened next) and married his niece Catherine to Henri II of France (which helped lead to the French Wars of Religion a half century later).  He also struggled to keep Hapsburgs at arm's length while simultaneously accepting financial support from Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.  Pretty historically significant, I would think, but this series would have you believe that it was nothing but parties and commissions for Michelangelo that made Leo X and Clement VII historically important.One need not even bother with the hereditary Grand Dukes of Tuscany.  Aside from Cosimo I, the series can hardly be bothered to mention the Grand Dukes by name.  Once the series is past Cosimo I, it is all Galileo, all the time.  One really doesn't even find out what ultimately happened to the Medici Grand Dukes, even though the series ostensibly is about them and their family.  Ahhh, picky picky picky.  I guess that is what books are for.If you want lots of lovingly framed camera shots of Renaissance artwork, then by golly you will love this series.

793739,A2AV7Q95QGPTO0,B00015HXCW,Diego Banducci,"[1, 2]","Timothy Walker's excellent review highlights some of the deficiencies in this DVD. To them I would add the irritation of a narrator speaking English with an Italian accent and glamorized portrayals of the principal players (Cosimo was short and ugly, the actor who plays him is tall and handsome; Lorenzo was a real womanizer, not the caring husband depicted here).Having just finishedByzantium: The Lost Empirewith John Romer, an older, portly narrator who knows his subject, I found this glamorization dishonest and irritating. Adding to that irritation is the fact that the time periods covered by the four programs were chosen arbitrarily and simplistically: (1) the life and times of Cosimo il Vecchio; (2) the life and times of Lorenzo; (3) the Medici popes and Michelangelo; and (4) The life and times of Cosimo I and Galileo. Thus, discussion of the great years of the family ends with the second program.For the most part, the program wholly overlooks the contribution of Giovanni di Bicci, patriarch of the family, father of Cosimo and founder of the Medici Bank. When Lorenzo came along, the family began its slow decline. Not quite ""shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations,"" but close. Only the family's enormous wealth preserved its influence for a few more generations.As for Cosimo il Vecchio, wholly overlooked is the fact that because he was a money lender, he was terrified of what punishment awaited him in the afterlife. Much of his life was spent praying in his own cell in the Dominican monastery of San Marco, the same monastery where Savanarola lived. Both cells have been preserved and may be visited today.In discussing Savanarola, the program graphically presents the Bonfire of the Vanities, but fails to mention what happened to Savanarola shortly thereafter. He was, upon order of the Vatican, publicly burned in the principal square of Florence. The Church did not like Reformers, especially during the Reformation.To the film's credit, there are interviews with knowledgeable authors and academics. Ross King, author ofBrunelleschi's Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture,Michelangelo and the Pope's CeilingandMachiavelli: Philosopher of Power (Eminent Lives)made numerous cogent observations about the building of the Duomo,  Michelangelo, and political life in Italy at the time, as do James Saslow of CUNY and Mario Biagoli of Georgetown. Dale Kent's comments are eminently forgettable.The greatest value of the film for me lay in its presenting chronologically a lot of facts that I was familiar with but did not know the sequence in which they occurred.Viewers who would like a more incisive and detailed take on the Medicis' financial dealings should consider reading Tim Parks'Medici Money: Banking, Metaphysics, and Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence (Enterprise) (Enterprise).

THE MEDICI: GODFATHERS OF THE RENAISSANCE is a four-hour docudrama that is at once entertaining and educational. Using the technique of contemporary seated scholars in discussion with the viewer interspersed with actors playing the roles of the peoples of Florence and Rome and the famous Medici family that spanned three centuries of control and influence in Italy, this highly entertaining and beautifully photographed history lesson is a valuable addition to schools, historians, and lovers of history and biography.The Medici family was a mercantile line that amassed enough wealth to be able to live (and even become) royally. The Medicis are attributed with the advent of the Renaissance, having been the patrons of the greats of Western Art and Science, not the least of which are Michelangelo, Botticelli, da Vinci, Vasari, Bruneschelli, and Galileo. But patronage of the arts was not their only forte: through sheer power they were able to produce two popes (Leo and Clement)and it was through the debauchery and power of Leo, bankrupting the papacy with his earthly appetites, that the use of Papal Indulgences (anyone could 'purchase' redemption for a price that fed the papal coffers) that was the immediate cause driving Martin Luther to initiate the Reformation.Along the 4 hours of this DVD we are introduced to Savoranola, Machiavelli, Pope Julius II, and the various fighting factions of Florence Italy wherein the Medicis held court for over 200 years. Despite the recorded evils of this infamous family, they were enlightened (especially Lorenzo the Magnificent) to see the gifts of Michelangelo, da Vinci, etc and were it not for their patronage we may never have had the beauties of the statues David, Pieta, the Medici tombs, or the Sistine chapel frescoes to mention only a few. Nor would Galileo, the giant of Science, have been able to nudge his theories of the Universe, gravity, telescopic drawings of the moon, etc.The filming is magnificent, especially the use of very Renaissance period costumes and actors with faces that seem to leap from the paintings of the era. Bloodshed is not spared: the period would not seem completely evaluated with out the atrocities of the Inquisition. At times the docudrama portion seems a bit pushed toward the Hollywood spectacle, but how else could this colorfully rich and historically important period be represented? The one flaw that is a constant is the atrocious music score: every moment of death or defeat is backed by a simplistically awful plagiarism of Wagner's ""Gotterdamerung"" and non-authentic vocal wailings by bad boy sopranos attempting to sound like folk music or plainsong. But these flaws are minor in evaluating the whole project. This is definitely a DVD that every home should own - for pleasure, for historical resource, and for appreciation of where we are as a civilization today.

I should note that I am writing this review as someone who knows little about the Renaissance beyond what I was taught in grade school.To me, this documentary felt very incomplete. I don't want to say disappointing, but I would expect better from PBS. The documentary does teach you a few things about the Medici, but many aspects remain in the dark. For example how the Medici's banks worked, its relationship to Papacy, why the Pope turned against the Medici and closed the branches... none of these questions are answered. The documentary starts with Cosimo de Medici looking for manuscripts of classical Greek thinkers, but we are not told why the sudden interest in the classical period. The first episode ends with the death of Cosimo, but the second episode seemed to begin much later, with Lorenzo Medici. They skipped a generation. Why Cosimo was a patron of the arts was not explained well - the only explanation was that this gave them political capital, but how that happened was unclear. In the second episode, people suddenly turn toward Savonarola and start burning their books, etc. How the mood shifts so suddenly is not explained at all. As some other reviewers mentioned, the characters are also one-dimensional. Their complex motivations and different dimensions of their personality, why they did what they did are not explained well.The series seemed to focus too much on what was happening in Florence, but nothing was said of what was happening elsewhere in Italy and how the relationship with Vatican was changing. The bank was a European enterprise but we really have little knowledge of the dynamics of external relationships with other power centers. Why does the Pope send military forces to Florence and kill both Lorenzo and his brother?That said, I really enjoyed the detailed descriptions of how Brunelleschi built his dome and his invention of perspective. I also enjoyed the first episode in general. Unfortunately, the series generates many more questions than it answered for me. Nonetheless, as someone who knows little about the period, it piqued my interest and made me want to learn more. So I guess I can't say I am disappointed.If you know little about the period, this series may be a good starting point, but I don't think it will satisfy your appetite.

Roman Catholicism provided convenient robes to hide behind whilst our visionaries in the powerful Medici family brought their own artistic ideals to fruition. Lorenzo Il Magnifico, in particular, did a stunning job of instilling a mostly secular feel in a city with a Roman Catholic history.

The artwork was wonderful.  The history, however, left a lot to be desired.Sometimes the story is told correctly.  Sometimes it was incomplete.  Sometimes, it was downright misleading.  In short, the show was mainly about some members of the Medici family and the artists they supported.  However, there are long time periods not addressed or given a cursory mention.Among the issues/problems I had with the program:  the reform-minded monk Savonarola is mentioned prominently in episode two, but we are not told of his eventual fate (he was hanged and burned); the city of Florence enjoys ten years as a republic, away from the influence of the Medici, but it lasts barely minutes in the show;  the sack of Rome in 1527, a horrible event motivated by greed, was portrayed as an act of ""holy war"" by Lutherans against Catholic Rome (incorrect - there were both Lutherans and Catholics in the ransacking army, and some fellow Romans took part as well); the break between Pope Clement VII (aka Giulio de Medici) and Henry VIII of England, resulting in the creation of the Anglican Church, is not even mentioned; Galileo is portrayed as the originator of the idea that the sun is the center of the universe, when in fact the theory had already been proposed, most notably by Copernicus; and finally, the show depicts Galileo as a broken man after his hearing with the Inquisition.  In reality, although he was under house arrest, he was able to continue his work, and lived for nine more years before dying in 1642.As I mentioned earlier, there was so much to like about this program, I am disappointed that some of the statements and accounts presented are just not accurate.  Still, I would recommend it is a starting point to learn more about this fascinating period in history; there is much worthwhile information here.Three stars.

793753,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00015HXCW,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 8]","Actually, what troubled me while watching ""Empires - The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance,"" was the narration by Massimo Marinoni.  It was not as bad as listening to Chico Marx's Eyetalian accent, but I did find it a bit heavy handed at times for this PBS documentary series.  If this were for a part in a movie about the Medici it might work, but here it ended up being an annoyance far too often and made the silent actors who play out the historical episodes under consideration look good in comparison.  Those re-enactments are mixed with the talking heads of historians and writers who comment on the history.The focus here is on the Medici family of Florence during the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century, and I should point out that my family cooked for them (and did some poisoning apparently).  Their rise to power was as a political family was based on running a bank, which, in time, became the official bank of the Vatican.  Two of the Medici even became Popes, but they are also remembered for being patrons of the arts and sciences.  Such towering figures as Michelangelo, da Vinci, Botticelli, Vasari, and Galileo all worked for the Medici, and there are times when the documentary gets sidetracked by artistic and architectural accomplishments that push the Medici into the background.  This is what justifies the series subtitle, since it suggests the Medici were operating the strings that allowed art to flourish.  But you will end up knowing more about how Michelangelo's ""David"" served as a political symbol during this period than you will about some of the Medici who are supposedly the primary focus.  The result is a general introduction to both the Medici and the Italian Renaissance, but not by any means a comprehensive examination of either.""The Medici"" is comprised of four episodes, which basically focus on succeeding generations of the Florentine family.  ""Birth of a Dynasty"" follows the rise of Cosimo the Elder (1389-1464) as the family came to power in Florence in the early 1400s amidst political intrigue.  This was when Cosmio established a balance of power between Florence, Milan and Venice.  As a patron of culture, Cosimo was responsible for the Palazzo Medici and commissioned works by the likes of Donatello.  ""The Magnificent Medici"" is centered on Cosmio's grandson Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-92), who survived an assassination attempt by the competing Pazzi family and gathered the intellectual flower of the times in Florence.  With great artists like Botticelli, Michelangelo and da Vinci around, this is probably the most familiar ground of the documentary.  What becomes key here are Lorenzo's failures in the family banking business, because along with the rise of Girolamo Savonarola, who religious orthodoxy led to the celebrating Bonfire of the Vanities, that set the stage for the next generation of Medici where the Church becomes the stage for power politics.""The Medici Popes"" finds the Medici cousins Givoanni (1475-1523) and Giulio (1478-1534) ending up in robe as Pope Leo X and Pope Clement VII.  This episode establishes the greatest impact of the Medicis on western civilization as Pope Leo X commissions the Sistine Chapel and other great works fo arts, but empties the coffers of the Church.  As a way of raising money he starts selling papal indulgences, which is what outrages Martin Luther and leads to the Reformation.  By the end of this one the question ""How many battalions has the Pope?"" is clearly not a rhetorical one.  ""Power vs. Truth"" is centered on Cosimo I the Great (1519-1574), who restored the Medici fortunes as the First Grand Duke of Tuscany.  However, this Cosimo is forgotten by the end of the episode as the Inquisition takes sway in Italy and the fate of Galileo is presented as not only the end of the Italian Renaissance but the final chapter of the Medicis as well.  However, Galileo's ""trial"" was in 1633, decades after Cosimo's death, so the link is not as strong as that between the Medici Pope and Martin Luther in the previous episode.So, on the one hand I certainly learned more about the Medici then I knew before.  Certainly I have a better sense of the key generations in the family's history to go along with their resumes for patronage.  But on the other hand I also have the feeling that there is so much more to learn about this family.  Each generation gets its own episode, but there is a varying degree to which the focus stays on each of those generations.  The makers of the documentary seem much more comfortable talking about the building of the Duomo, the magnificent dome built by Filippo Brunelleschi for the cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore, than about the machinations of Lorenzo and the other Medici.

Once you get started with the first episode you will likely be addicted and unable to go without the remaining episodes.  The story of the Medici family and it's intrigues are more engrossing and unbelievable than any soap-opera plot.  It is a story how one clan in history can so affect their world that the reverberations of their rise and fall continue to this day.  Along the way you see the subtle themes behind some of the greatest works of art ever produced.  And you will see the corruption and pride that ripped the unity of the church and bred the reformation.  It is a complex tale that could fill volumes but this series gives it such life and such appeal that you will find it a joy to watch again and again.  Only one minor misgiving about this series - and that is the treatment of the Galileo episode.  It seemed to be tacked on to the end of the final episode and hurried so much that I fear it perpetrated the myth of that episode of history by failing to discuss the complexities of the situation.  Perhaps time constraints affected this but after so much depth in complexity covered in earlier portions, it left me wondering why the final minutes was so shallow.

In this case, the silliness includes gratuitous corpse shots, a narrator with a raspy Italian accent that makes him sound like a character from the original Scarface, and the requisite ""cliff hanger"" endings of the first two episodes (WHO would take Cosimo Medici's place? Was the Renaissance OVER?), the last of which never being fully explained in the third episode (yes, Savanarola did take over Florence, kiced out the Medicis and burned a lot of art, but the series never mentions that he was killed 2 years later and Florence transitioned into a Republic).Still, the series is based on an interesting family and an interesting time. Not only the originators of the Renaissance (Cosimo and Lorenzo dominate the first two episodes) but also the family's downward slide with the two Medici popes (both of whom are disasters) and the Medici relationship with Galileo. This series is as complete as a PBS series can be concerning a subject matter. And if things are glossed over and not fully explained, that's not the purpose.Either way, this is the DVD for folks curious about Renaissance conspiracies.

Smith ""Polymath""","[5, 5]","The Italian Renaissance is one of the most interesting periods of Western history; understanding it is critical to understanding the emergence of the modern world.  The Medici of Florence were among its most important and interesting figures.  Therefore, a series on the Medici comes with the promise of being potentially both interesting and useful.Unfortunately, this series is marginal at best.  The first problem is its superficiality.  Significant issues--like the eventual fate of Savonarola, or Michaelangelo's post-Last Judgement career in designing St. Peter's are ignored.  Important aspects of intellectual history--notably Ficino and the Platonic Academy, one of the most important Medici institutions and critical to understanding figures like Botticelli, or the work of Alberti, or the link between Leo X's sale of indulgences and the building of St. Peter's--are completely ignored, in favor of a great deal of time on the more sensational aspects of the Medici.  One would get the impression from watching the fourth section that Galileo developed the heliocentric theory--instead of Copernicus, nearly a century earlier.  As an introduction to the world of the Florentine Renaissance, it suffers badly in comparison to Rossellini's remarkable The Age of the Medici inEclipse Series 14: Rossellini's History Films - Renaissance and Enlightenment (Blaise Pascal / The Age of the Medici / Cartesius) (The Criterion Collection).The talking heads all have impressive credentials, but among them only Ross King has a really first-rate understanding of the period.  Frankly, you would be better off reading his books--Michelangelo and the Pope's CeilingandBrunelleschi's Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture.The first two episodes, centering on Cosimo di Medici and Lorenzo di Medici, are the strongest.  The third and fourth suffer more from a superficial view and at times a disregard for the actual facts of the case--as in the treatment of the Sack of Rome in episode three.The second problem is stylistic.  Too much cutting, impressionistic montage, the use of pseudo-period music instead of the real thing--it seems pitched towards an audience raised on badly made thrillers rather than one eager for a well-made documentary.Not recommended, in particular, for those with no background in the period.
