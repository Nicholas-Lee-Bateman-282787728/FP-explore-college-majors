After a few days of worry and watchfulness, the trapper decides to investitgate. Leaving his daughter at home, he and his servant begin to hunt for the brazen Indian brave who has watched them every evening...just out of firing range. The hunt proves fruitless and the two return home only to find Beth (trapper's daughter) missing. And so we watch as those two take off in a pursuit that will lead them deep into dangerous Indian territory.Meanwhile, Beth, who is terrified of her Indian captor, tries desperately to gain her freedom. However, as he takes her farther and farther from the only home she has ever known, he shows her unbelievable kindness and understanding. Beth, almost unwillingly, falls for the man she comes to know as Grayeagle, but their different heritages and the mystery of why he kidnapped her will have to be overcome before they can be together...if they can be together.A really romantic and engaging western. It has its imperfections, at least by the standards of we modern viewers who are used to equally modern technology, but considering that it rather an older film, it's really quite remarkable and can easily be forgiven a lot.",5,One of my All Time Favorites,1053302400,"05 19, 2003",2003,1332,"['trapper', 'beautiful', 'daughter', 'Indian', 'servant', 'live', 'peaceful', 'isolation', 'begin', 'spot', 'evidence', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'alone', 'thought', 'few', 'days', 'worry', 'watchfulness', 'trapper', 'investitgate', 'Leaving', 'daughter', 'home', 'servant', 'begin', 'hunt', 'brazen', 'Indian', 'brave', 'who', 'watched', 'evening', 'just', 'firing', 'range', 'hunt', 'fruitless', 'two', 'return', 'home', 'only', 'find', 'Beth', 'trapper', 'daughter', 'missing', 'so', 'watch', 'two', 'take', 'off', 'pursuit', 'will', 'lead', 'deep', 'dangerous', 'Indian', 'territory.Meanwhile', 'Beth', 'who', 'terrified', 'Indian', 'captor', 'desperately', 'gain', 'freedom', 'However', 'farther', 'farther', 'only', 'home', 'ever', 'known', 'unbelievable', 'kindness', 'understanding', 'Beth', 'almost', 'unwillingly', 'man', 'know', 'Grayeagle', 'different', 'heritages', 'mystery', 'why', 'kidnapped', 'will', 'have', 'be', 'overcome', 'can', 'be', 'together', 'can', 'be', 'together.A', 'really', 'romantic', 'engaging', 'western', 'imperfections', 'least', 'standards', 'modern', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'equally', 'modern', 'technology', 'considering', 'rather', 'older', 'film', 'really', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'forgiven', 'lot']",Grayeagle VHS

The film lacked direction and important plot details were sketchy or entirely missing.  The transition of the girl from kidnap victim to grateful granddaughter was hazy; it took a couple rewinds for us to figure out what the heck the old man's relationship to her was, and we're no slackers when it comes to following a storyline.  There just seemed to be no discernible direction; it felt like a vignette rather than an honest film.  Grayeagle came across as an ambitious movie that overreached itself and fell flat.  Its political correctness made it even less palatable.  The acting was fine on the part of Alex Cord and Ben Johnson, as well as many of the Indians, but the girl was awful, unable to evoke much from the viewer except annoyance or pity.  The only reason we watched it is we're big Alex Cord fans, but felt like this movie was a waste of his talent and our time.  It did have hints of romance but went absolutely nowhere in that area, either, leaving us puzzled instead of edified.

Bring in the icing on the cake, in the super hunk  Alex Cord and it makes for a good guilty pleasure!  It is the story of the Cheyenne warrior Gray Eagle who is charged with filling the last request of his aging chief, Running Wolf.  The dream is that he bring to him the daughter he fathered years ago that doesn't know of his existence.  She lives in the foothills of the mountains with her supposed father and her mothers brother Standing Bear (Iron Eyes Coty).  The capture of Beth and her fathers and Standing Bears search for her return makes for an interesting story shot in beautiful surroundings.  It has enough action to appeal to men with a muscle to muscle challenges and enough eye candy in the virility of Gray Eagle to appeal to women. Add in the wonderful horse handling by Cord and all in all a good story with real characters. Of course it wouldn't be a western movie without Jack Elam, who can pull more characters out of his head than many actors with more star power!
