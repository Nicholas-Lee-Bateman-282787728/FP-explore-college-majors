He was perfect for that show and this one. I do however wish they hadn't changed the characters. People has commented on the acting, but remember is was a series in the 90 's.  It may not be Academy Award material, but the fact that go eac show has good family and Christian values, makes it all worth it.",5,Good Wholesome Family Show,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",2014,454,"['show', 'whole', 'family', 'can', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'days', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'series', 'Walton', 'was', 'perfect', 'show', 'one', 'do', 'however', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'changed', 'characters', 'People', 'commented', 'acting', 'remember', 'was', 'series', '90', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Academy', 'Award', 'material', 'fact', 'go', 'eac', 'show', 'good', 'family', 'Christian', 'values']",N/A

Still a great escape for half an hour - each episode - and the scenery is stunning and makes you want to become lost... if only being stranded on a paradise could be as easy as that!This is classic family entertainment and if you like all things Swiss Family Robinson, then it is a must have to add to your collection.",4,Fun and Adventure,1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,397,"['series', 'television', 'not', 'bad', 'take', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'story', 'Still', 'great', 'escape', 'hour', 'episode', 'scenery', 'stunning', 'want', 'become', 'lost', 'only', 'being', 'stranded', 'paradise', 'could', 'be', 'as', 'easy', 'classic', 'family', 'entertainment', 'like', 'things', 'Swiss', 'Family', 'Robinson', 'then', 'must', 'have', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

Good cast.The only thing they could have improved was condensing the packaging. Six large DVD cases takes up too much shelf space for bulk collectors like myself. Other serieses have been released single cases with folding DVD holders a fraction of the size.But buy it anyway. The later episodes will keep you glued to the TV, and the earlier ones will set the mood for that.Peter",4,Adventures of Swiss Family Robinson,1174521600,"03 22, 2007",2007,457,"['Good', 'serialized', 'storyline', 'Excellent', 'footage', 'combining', 'studio', 'locations', 'Good', 'cast.The', 'only', 'thing', 'could', 'have', 'improved', 'was', 'condensing', 'packaging', 'Six', 'large', 'DVD', 'cases', 'up', 'too', 'much', 'shelf', 'space', 'bulk', 'collectors', 'Other', 'serieses', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'single', 'cases', 'folding', 'DVD', 'holders', 'fraction', 'size.But', 'buy', 'anyway', 'later', 'episodes', 'will', 'keep', 'glued', 'TV', 'earlier', 'ones', 'will', 'set', 'mood', 'that.Peter']",N/A

I grew up watching Richard Thomas when I was a teenager. He did a fantastic father role and ALL the other characters were just as great!! It was a great cast, a great story line, complete drama from the very first to the very last minute. I have never had a story keep me on my toes so completely for the entire story. What an achievement!! The photography and the scenery were just fantastic . . . made you want to walk through the TV and join them. The actors/actresses were just perfect in their roles as they unfolded, and became a family, which seemed to really happen before our eyes!! I can't say enough good about it . . . and my family from 10-21 boys and girls were just as HAPPY as I!!!  Wish there was a sequel to it 10 years later!! Great family entertainment with great family values and enough mystery and intrigue to go along to make it just right. The best thing there is in TELEVISION!! Richard, you didn't disappoint at all. I expected much from you and you did just that. Thanks for making this series. Please do some more!!!",5,It was just GREAT!!,1179360000,"05 17, 2007",2007,1158,"['family', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'series', 'were', 'not', 'disappointd', 'least', 'IT', 'WAS', 'JUST', 'GREAT', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Richard', 'Thomas', 'when', 'was', 'teenager', 'did', 'fantastic', 'father', 'role', 'other', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'complete', 'drama', 'very', 'first', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'story', 'keep', 'toes', 'so', 'completely', 'entire', 'story', 'What', 'achievement', 'photography', 'scenery', 'were', 'just', 'fantastic', 'made', 'want', 'walk', 'TV', 'join', 'actors/actresses', 'were', 'just', 'perfect', 'roles', 'unfolded', 'became', 'family', 'seemed', 'really', 'happen', 'eyes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'family', '10-21', 'boys', 'girls', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'HAPPY', 'Wish', 'was', 'sequel', '10', 'years', 'later', 'Great', 'family', 'entertainment', 'great', 'family', 'values', 'enough', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'go', 'along', 'make', 'just', 'right', 'best', 'thing', 'TELEVISION', 'Richard', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'expected', 'much', 'did', 'just', 'Thanks', 'making', 'series', 'Please', 'do', 'more']",N/A
925941,A1NVIEXCA20W7N,B000AC7PF6,Reliable Reviews Too,"[0, 0]","A likeable cast. Shot on location in Fiji. Nice costumes; nice sets; nice tree-house. Different stories than the Disney story.Compared to the lousy stuff available on TV today; this is 5-stars. The script-writing jumps back and forth between 3 and 4 stars due to some moments of bad script writing here and there. However, they pack a lot of adventures into every episode; moving between three different sub-plots throughout an episode, thus there is always something to hold your attention. You enjoy spending time on the tropical island with the characters and sharing their adventures.",5,Likeable characters in beautiful Fiji.,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,588,"['likeable', 'cast', 'Shot', 'location', 'Fiji', 'Nice', 'costumes', 'nice', 'sets', 'nice', 'tree-house', 'Different', 'stories', 'Disney', 'story.Compared', 'lousy', 'stuff', 'available', 'TV', 'today', '5-stars', 'script-writing', 'jumps', 'back', 'forth', '3', '4', 'stars', 'due', 'moments', 'bad', 'script', 'writing', 'here', 'there', 'However', 'pack', 'lot', 'adventures', 'episode', 'moving', 'three', 'different', 'sub-plots', 'episode', 'thus', 'always', 'something', 'hold', 'attention', 'enjoy', 'spending', 'time', 'tropical', 'island', 'characters', 'sharing', 'adventures']",N/A
