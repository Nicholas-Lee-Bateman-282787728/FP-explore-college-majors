842812,A6F61DLQJEURB,B0002PUFWQ,Andrea Bowhill,"[19, 19]","Quick Brief Background History - War Brides WWI & WWIIWartime Britain was host to ten of thousands of allied serviceman lonely and far from home. Many of the young women living around the military camps were swept off their feet by the young visitors romance blossomed and marriages were hastily arranged before the new husbands were posted away to war. More than one hundred thousand British war brides and large numbers of children were given berths on war-time troop transports and sailed the treacherous seas to their new lives their husband's homeland waiting in hope to be together once again. Most were bound for Canada, others to the United States, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Large groups of European women were also transported through Britain and their numbers swell the total departure figures.Film - The War Bride - London 1941London, most men were away at war it was the height of the Blitz, things weren't looking so good, spirits needed to be raised high, Lily (Anna Friel) and friends were looking to have fun. There had been a buzz of gossip that allied serviceman were in town, the girls rally, put on their glad rags for dancing to meet some new men. At the war dance Lily meets a Canadian soldier on leave one Charlie Travis (Aden Young) they quickly fall madly in love and with an urgency of being literally under the gun they get married before the week is out, Charlie is soon thereafter called back to the front, Lily now thinks she's also pregnant.Two Years later, Lily has only seen her husband for thirteen days over the entire course of their marriage. She then receives word from the Canadian Embassy that she and her baby daughter are to live in Canada to wait for her husband's return. Lily's quiet sold on the idea as Charlie had told her about his place the Ranch in Canada, this also means living with her Canadian in-laws.Remote, rural Spring Hill, Alberta, Canada isn't very welcoming; Lily turns up in her bright red lipstick matching red hat and lots of London cockney spirit, it doesn't sit well with the mother in-law Betty (Brenda Ficker) as she looks in disbelief at what her son has married and is more concerned that she won't be getting Charlie's pay check as this now goes to his new wife. Charlie's crippled sister Sylvia (Molly Parker) finds Lily's brash manner too forward for their simple life. Lily realizes she may have just swapped one horrendous existence for another as she struggles to survive with the in-laws on a dilapidated farm in the bleak wildness, she feels so alone, what has Charlie landed her in and when will he be coming home.My OverviewThis is such a lovely Film to watch. I would like to say at this point the film moves very quickly through London and it's Blitz some may feel this seems a little rushed to begin with, but this film was only done on a small budget and the point of the film is about the new life for this war bride after London, in Canada things are more drawn out which really make up for it.Wonderful Casting, all the main characters in this film show their own wounds from this war and I mean shown from what's inside their insecurities, resentments, perceived slights or damaged self-esteem and how people in life tread careful around things simmering, restraining themselves, until a sudden point of boiling over, this is so well acted from all the cast. I also loved the many little touches to this film which made it special, like passed down stories you may have heard from your own grandparents, such as huddling together on a dance floor during a Blitz as the party continues in whispers or a wedding dress made from a table cloth due to lack of money or material just the simple touches.It's funny, happy, sad, endearing, touching, a fascinating smart and involving story, it's a film about Hope. Working this well, Screenwriter Angela Workman loosely based her script on her own mother's life. The wonderful scenery and 1940's costumes, fabulous music from this era all add to make it great. The Cast were all very strong in this, Anna Friel who I have seen growing through the years in great productions on UK TV, this preformance on film I believe is one of her best.Extra Information - Language UsedLily and friends are from London's East End, so the accent used by them all would be English Cockney. Only a few London English Cockney slang words are used in passing and explained in this Film.Great Film Recommended.Andrea Bowhill",4,The War Bride (Love Will Meet Again),1200268800,"01 14, 2008",2008,4449,"['Quick', 'Brief', 'Background', 'History', 'War', 'Brides', 'WWI', 'WWIIWartime', 'Britain', 'was', 'host', 'ten', 'thousands', 'allied', 'serviceman', 'lonely', 'far', 'home', 'Many', 'young', 'women', 'living', 'military', 'camps', 'were', 'swept', 'off', 'feet', 'young', 'visitors', 'romance', 'blossomed', 'marriages', 'were', 'hastily', 'arranged', 'new', 'husbands', 'were', 'posted', 'away', 'war', 'More', 'one', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'British', 'war', 'brides', 'large', 'numbers', 'children', 'were', 'given', 'berths', 'war-time', 'troop', 'transports', 'sailed', 'treacherous', 'seas', 'new', 'lives', 'husband', 'homeland', 'waiting', 'hope', 'be', 'together', 'once', 'again', 'Most', 'were', 'bound', 'Canada', 'others', 'United', 'States', 'South', 'Africa', 'Australia', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Large', 'groups', 'European', 'women', 'were', 'also', 'transported', 'Britain', 'numbers', 'swell', 'total', 'departure', 'figures.Film', 'War', 'Bride', 'London', '1941London', 'most', 'men', 'were', 'away', 'war', 'was', 'height', 'Blitz', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'looking', 'so', 'good', 'spirits', 'needed', 'be', 'raised', 'high', 'Lily', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'friends', 'were', 'looking', 'have', 'fun', 'had', 'been', 'buzz', 'gossip', 'allied', 'serviceman', 'were', 'town', 'girls', 'rally', 'put', 'glad', 'rags', 'dancing', 'meet', 'new', 'men', 'war', 'dance', 'Lily', 'Canadian', 'soldier', 'leave', 'one', 'Charlie', 'Travis', 'Aden', 'Young', 'quickly', 'fall', 'madly', 'love', 'urgency', 'being', 'literally', 'gun', 'get', 'married', 'week', 'out', 'Charlie', 'soon', 'thereafter', 'called', 'back', 'front', 'Lily', 'now', 'also', 'pregnant.Two', 'Years', 'later', 'Lily', 'only', 'seen', 'husband', 'thirteen', 'days', 'entire', 'course', 'marriage', 'then', 'word', 'Canadian', 'Embassy', 'baby', 'daughter', 'are', 'live', 'Canada', 'wait', 'husband', 'return', 'Lily', 'quiet', 'sold', 'idea', 'Charlie', 'had', 'told', 'place', 'Ranch', 'Canada', 'also', 'living', 'Canadian', 'in-laws.Remote', 'rural', 'Spring', 'Hill', 'Alberta', 'Canada', ""n't"", 'very', 'welcoming', 'Lily', 'up', 'bright', 'red', 'lipstick', 'matching', 'red', 'hat', 'lots', 'London', 'cockney', 'spirit', ""n't"", 'sit', 'well', 'mother', 'in-law', 'Betty', 'Brenda', 'Ficker', 'disbelief', 'what', 'son', 'married', 'more', 'concerned', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'getting', 'Charlie', 'pay', 'check', 'now', 'new', 'wife', 'Charlie', 'crippled', 'sister', 'Sylvia', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Lily', 'brash', 'manner', 'too', 'forward', 'simple', 'life', 'Lily', 'may', 'have', 'just', 'swapped', 'one', 'horrendous', 'existence', 'survive', 'in-laws', 'dilapidated', 'farm', 'bleak', 'wildness', 'so', 'alone', 'what', 'Charlie', 'landed', 'when', 'will', 'be', 'coming', 'home.My', 'OverviewThis', 'such', 'lovely', 'Film', 'watch', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'point', 'film', 'moves', 'very', 'quickly', 'London', 'Blitz', 'may', 'feel', 'little', 'rushed', 'begin', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'done', 'small', 'budget', 'point', 'film', 'new', 'life', 'war', 'bride', 'London', 'Canada', 'things', 'are', 'more', 'drawn', 'out', 'really', 'make', 'up', 'it.Wonderful', 'Casting', 'main', 'characters', 'film', 'show', 'own', 'wounds', 'war', 'mean', 'shown', 'what', 'inside', 'insecurities', 'resentments', 'perceived', 'slights', 'damaged', 'self-esteem', 'how', 'people', 'life', 'tread', 'careful', 'things', 'simmering', 'restraining', 'sudden', 'point', 'boiling', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'cast', 'also', 'loved', 'many', 'little', 'touches', 'film', 'made', 'special', 'passed', 'down', 'stories', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'own', 'grandparents', 'such', 'huddling', 'together', 'dance', 'floor', 'Blitz', 'party', 'whispers', 'wedding', 'dress', 'made', 'table', 'cloth', 'due', 'lack', 'money', 'material', 'just', 'simple', 'touches.It', 'funny', 'happy', 'sad', 'endearing', 'touching', 'fascinating', 'smart', 'involving', 'story', 'film', 'Hope', 'Working', 'well', 'Screenwriter', 'Angela', 'Workman', 'loosely', 'based', 'script', 'own', 'mother', 'life', 'wonderful', 'scenery', '1940', 'costumes', 'fabulous', 'music', 'era', 'add', 'make', 'great', 'Cast', 'were', 'very', 'strong', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'growing', 'years', 'great', 'productions', 'UK', 'TV', 'preformance', 'film', 'believe', 'one', 'best.Extra', 'Information', 'Language', 'UsedLily', 'friends', 'are', 'London', 'East', 'End', 'accent', 'used', 'would', 'be', 'English', 'Cockney', 'Only', 'few', 'London', 'English', 'Cockney', 'slang', 'words', 'are', 'used', 'passing', 'explained', 'Film.Great', 'Film', 'Recommended.Andrea', 'Bowhill']",N/A
842813,A1NIGUK4M2ST8,B0002PUFWQ,mk,"[2, 2]","This is a genuinely good movie also released under the British title 'War Bride'.  You can go to that alternative Amazon title and see further reviews; also, I believe you can purchase it cheaper under the 'Love and War' title.It stars one of my favorite Brit actors, Anna Friel, whom we really liked also in the adaptation of Dicken's 'Our Mutual Friend'.  Here she portrays a young woman caught in the London bombings of WWII, who falls in love with a Canadian soldier just before he's to be deployed to the front.  It's practically love at first sight for they barely have a few days together and end up marrying each other before he's gone.She has their baby, and along with a friend is sent, as thousands did during the war, to Canada as a 'war bride'.  She travels to her husband's isolated, Alberta dirt farm, and meets, and is rejected by, his impoverished and bitter family.  Through thick and thin, she endures trying to keep her naturally high spirits, trying to better everyone's lives, and, of course, hoping that her husband, whom she can hardly remember, may return someday.One reviewer mentioned this story reminded her of 'Cold Comfort Farm'.  In some ways similar, Love and War, however, is a serious drama and lacks the sardonic humor of the other, very pleasant flick.A wonderful cast includes Brenda Fricker, who won an Oscar for the Daniel Day-Lewis' movie, 'My Left Foot'.  The photography and settings are well done.  Definitely an adult drama, there is a couple scenes of making out, and one bath scene with some nudity- it's brief and really nothing.  The characters are what is important here, and they are terrific.An  intense but overall uplifting movie about the persistence of spirit and the strength of love.

Very glad to see a bit more about the experience of WWII at home, showing some dramatized historical facts about WWII wives, and especially dealing with Canada. A very good cast, but I am baffled that Amazon's initial screen at the top doesn't list Friel as the major character for this movie. She handles the role and lines so intuitively. The key characters each held my interest, which says a lot about the actors' individual skills and experience, especially in carefully not overplaying their roles. A minor drawback was that some of the women's hairstyles, primarily Anna's, looked pretty artificial, enough that it distracted a bit from the movie. I'm more than happy with the movie, and hope to see more from Ms. Friel, especially if she is picky enough to get such roles.",5,Interesting & not well known Canadian-British WWII experience,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,938,"['film', ""n't"", 'mystery', 'done', 'level', 'performances', 'mysteries', 'such', 'Foyle', 'War', 'so', 'enjoy', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'Very', 'glad', 'see', 'bit', 'more', 'experience', 'WWII', 'home', 'showing', 'dramatized', 'historical', 'facts', 'WWII', 'wives', 'especially', 'dealing', 'Canada', 'very', 'good', 'cast', 'am', 'baffled', 'Amazon', 'initial', 'screen', 'top', ""n't"", 'list', 'Friel', 'major', 'character', 'movie', 'role', 'lines', 'so', 'intuitively', 'key', 'characters', 'held', 'interest', 'lot', 'actors', 'individual', 'skills', 'experience', 'especially', 'carefully', 'not', 'overplaying', 'roles', 'minor', 'drawback', 'was', 'women', 'hairstyles', 'primarily', 'Anna', 'looked', 'pretty', 'artificial', 'enough', 'distracted', 'bit', 'movie', ""'m"", 'more', 'happy', 'movie', 'hope', 'see', 'more', 'Ms.', 'Friel', 'especially', 'picky', 'enough', 'get', 'such', 'roles']",N/A

War reaches far beyond the battlefield to the individual lives of men, women, and children living civilian lives. War Brides is an interesting look into Canadian soldiers, who married British women.  During the war, the women immigrate to Canada and live with the family of the men they've married.  Of course, after the whirlwind romances, while the men are still at war, the women face the unknown in a strange land.  Some hit the jackpot with accepting families with money, while others hit rock bottom with unwelcoming family and poverty.I enjoyed the movie for the most part, though there were many gray areas never explained regarding the characters.  Of course, when the husband returned from war, he return with baggage and psychological scarring as well.  The woman he adored while facing death, is suddenly a stranger to him now that he is facing life.  Though in the end, the husband comes around and the marriage begins to heal, I found the way the movie ended flat and not very satisfying.
