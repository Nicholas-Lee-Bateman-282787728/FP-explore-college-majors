It's always at the very least, something of a relief when a sci-fi channel original turns out to be something other than an uninspired, formulaic monster movie. This was definitely different.The main drawback is ironically derived from a positive. It's not often the Sci-Fi Channel makes a movie with a likable cast, and in this case likable characters were getting killed off left and right while a bunch of extras were milling around unscathed for most of the movie.On the other hands it good that the movie had likable characters at all.On another note, this movie festures masses of snaks, not the usual insect swarm or giant animal. And in something of an oddity for the Sci-Fi channel, there's no giant snakes in this movie.On second thought, 3/5.

1170229,A2WB9VCULDR27Q,B001B3LIM4,"brownie ""dogs AND dinosaurs rule!!!!!""","[2, 3]","Vipers: DVD ReviewGrade: C+Vipers was one of those Sci-Fi channel original movies that premiere on Sci-Fi Saturday; it's basically were they put their best movies. I love Sci-Fi's Saturday movies--some of my favorite Sci-Fi channel movies have come from there, likeSea BeastandWyvern--and they almost always have some pretty awesome plots.Vipers is no exception--the plot may not be original, seeing that it is close to Guy N. Smith's Snakes--but I love plots like these. A group of genetically altered vipers--and by genetically altered, I mean made about 100 times more vicious than normal, and they now have an appetite for human flesh--are accidently set loose on a town called Eden. Since the town is on an island, the snakes have nowhere to go, and start feasting on the locals.The locals, including an extremely annoying Tara Reid playing an even more annoying character who is growing pot in her garden, join up with each other to try and stop the snakes, along with save their own lives. Then--of course--the government comes in, and wants to wipe out the whole town, getting rid of the menacing snakes before they can reach the mainland.Yeah, it sounds cool, but Vipers just has too many problems to keep it from being cool. First of all: the characters. They are all stereotypes, and are all annoying. (You just want them to die at the hands of the snakes...) I think the only person that convincingly played their role without being annoying was the lady scientist who helps the townsfolk. Second, the snakes look terrible. They are all CGI, but they look worse than a typical video game's graphics. Third, the plot, as great as it is, is way too predictable. Couldn't they have thrown in something more original once in awhile?Fourth is the most important one: they need to get their facts straight. The vipers don't act like vipers, and every action they make is something that vipers don't do. (The vipers start eating people--I don't think vipers literally take bites out of people....) And when a boy is bitten by one of the vipers--before the town even knows about them--they immediately have the right anti-venom at hand. The doctor didn't even know what kind of snake bit the boy--the mother just said ""he got bite by a snake!"" Don't you have to know what specific type of snake before you administer the anti-venom? Because if you don't, and you have the wrong anti-venom, aren't you just putting a new venom into the body?So in the end, if you don't mind wrong facts, bad CGI, a good but predictable plot, and annoying characters, than you'll enjoy Vipers. It had some fun moments, which sort of redeemed the movie, but I couldn't give it anything higher than a C+.

Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[4, 5]","About 30 minutes into the movie, Tara Reid actually calls herself (or at least the character she is playing) a trainwreck. Self-parody intended or not, that was worth a star all by itself. Otherwise, the movie lurches in the gutter (it is comparable to some of those dreadful Masters of Horror movies). The story is not that bad (although predictable) but the fake snakes take the cake. They appear so fake that they don't even blend in with the scenery. It looks as if someone has drawn them onto the screen (animated snakes would have actually been MORE credible). And by the way, snakes don't feed that way, either, nor do they travel in packs like wolverines - they need to check their facts. But at that point, it is only a minor criticism. The movie is redeemed at times by scenes of unntentional amusement. If they gave acting awards out for being able to make an audience howl without trying whatsoever to be funny, Reid and Bernsen would be right up there with the best of them.Hearing your toothless uncle talk politics at Thanksgiving dinner might be more intertaining than this.",2,"A Poor Excuse Even for a ""Genre"" Flick",1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,1090,"['30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'actually', 'least', 'character', 'playing', 'trainwreck', 'Self-parody', 'intended', 'not', 'was', 'star', 'Otherwise', 'movie', 'gutter', 'comparable', 'dreadful', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'movies', 'story', 'not', 'bad', 'predictable', 'fake', 'snakes', 'take', 'cake', 'appear', 'so', 'fake', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'blend', 'scenery', 'someone', 'drawn', 'screen', 'animated', 'snakes', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'MORE', 'credible', 'way', 'snakes', 'do', ""n't"", 'feed', 'way', 'either', 'do', 'travel', 'packs', 'wolverines', 'need', 'check', 'facts', 'point', 'only', 'minor', 'criticism', 'movie', 'redeemed', 'times', 'scenes', 'unntentional', 'amusement', 'gave', 'acting', 'awards', 'out', 'being', 'able', 'make', 'audience', 'howl', 'trying', 'whatsoever', 'be', 'funny', 'Reid', 'Bernsen', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'there', 'best', 'them.Hearing', 'toothless', 'uncle', 'talk', 'politics', 'Thanksgiving', 'dinner', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'intertaining']",Vipers

Snakes have always been a weakness of mine. I don't like them, in movies or in real life. As the description from IMDb states, it's about mutated vipers. Not only do these slithering beasts strike innocent people, but they continue to devour them. So much so, that in some cases all that is left are clothes and in an early killing a wedding ring.The cast is pretty much made up of unknowns, except Corbin Bernsen & Tara Reid.  While the snakes themselves look pretty good, the animation and effects could use some work. When the snakes strike and attach onto victims, like leeches, I found it was over computerized and made for those parts to appear quite cheesy. Towards the end, the small number of survivors use everything from fire extinguishers, flares and even shotguns to fend off the snakes. They eventually lure them all into a greenhouse, turn on some propane tanks and set it ablaze.It comes to an end when the main scientist who was trying to protect his own name, finds himself in the back seat, proud of how he was trying to keep the whole ordeal under wraps. He then hears a growl and a hiss, looks down and is face to face with one of his own creations. The screen fades to black.The story I found alright, but with the computerized animation overused, I am going to say this is definitely a movie that is ok to have in the background as noise, while you are doing something else.[...]",3,Two Gory Chicks reviews,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,1584,"['was', 'one', 'movies', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'tv', 'decided', 'watch', 'turned', 'out', '20', 'minutes', 'be', 'so', 'bad', 'trainwreck', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'turn', 'away', 'Snakes', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'weakness', 'mine', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'real', 'life', 'description', 'IMDb', 'states', 'about', 'mutated', 'vipers', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'slithering', 'beasts', 'strike', 'innocent', 'people', 'continue', 'devour', 'So', 'much', 'cases', 'left', 'are', 'clothes', 'early', 'killing', 'wedding', 'ring.The', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'made', 'unknowns', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', 'Tara', 'Reid', 'snakes', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'animation', 'effects', 'could', 'use', 'work', 'When', 'snakes', 'strike', 'attach', 'victims', 'leeches', 'found', 'was', 'computerized', 'made', 'parts', 'appear', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'end', 'small', 'number', 'survivors', 'use', 'everything', 'fire', 'extinguishers', 'flares', 'even', 'shotguns', 'fend', 'off', 'snakes', 'eventually', 'lure', 'greenhouse', 'turn', 'propane', 'tanks', 'set', 'ablaze.It', 'end', 'when', 'main', 'scientist', 'who', 'was', 'trying', 'protect', 'own', 'name', 'back', 'seat', 'proud', 'how', 'was', 'trying', 'keep', 'whole', 'ordeal', 'wraps', 'then', 'growl', 'hiss', 'down', 'face', 'face', 'one', 'own', 'creations', 'screen', 'black.The', 'story', 'found', 'alright', 'computerized', 'animation', 'overused', 'am', 'going', 'say', 'definitely', 'movie', 'ok', 'have', 'background', 'noise', 'are', 'doing', 'something', 'else.', '[', ']']",Vipers

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 2]","It's hard to make a snake monster movie.It's not that snakes aren't scary, it's that they really don't need anything to make them even scarier.  The favorite snake du jour is the horned viper, presumably because the horns make it look evil.Snakes are primarily menacing because they are poisonous.  So its more the threat of being poisoned that makes snakes scary, with those inch long incisors that pump venom into your veins.  Crocodiles are scary because they bite you in half.  But snakes?  Snakes kill you in a much more slow and painful fashion.It's much scarier to have the threat of a snake bite than actually see it happen because it's over pretty quickly and then comes the long painful death scene. All that writhing and foaming requires quite a bit of acting and not a whole lot of snake screen time.  Remember that scene in Indiana Jones with the king cobra?  That's about as scary as snakes are ever going to get.But Vipers tries hard anyway.  It's obvious director Bill Corcoran is insecure about his snakes, because he rarely shows them close up.  Instead we get snakes fired like javelins at actors, snakes making odd squealing sounds as they burn, and snakes sneaking around under their victims' clothes. Vipers isn't just uptight about its snakes, it's got intimacy issues too. Remember the serpent in the Adam and Eve parable?  He's got nothing on these vipers, who take phallic innuendo to a whole new level by ruthlessly attacking anyone post-coitus.There's no acting that could save a monster tale this lame.  Tara Reid mumbles her way through some lines and woodenly recites others.  The rest of the cast isn't much better.When Vipers finally runs out of excuses to keep its panicky victims stuck on the island, the survivors decide to go back to the snake pit with the Worst Plan Ever Conceived. Why? Because ""if the snakes escape the island they could spread all over the world!""Really?  Seriously? The snakes, which are vulnerable to cold and repelled with fire extinguishers, are going to take over the world? Which part of the world exactly?  And is it too much to ask that writer Brian Katkin include a reference to the snakes being able to swim?  Because with the island under quarantine and the snakes unable to swim, it sure doesn't seem necessary to go back into a greenhouse with fertilizer, pot, and a blowtorch.The late Don S.
