979453,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B000EWBKLM,Artist & Author,"[0, 4]","I am neither impressed or unimpressed with this movie.  The first quality that bothered me were the flashbacks to some woman, apparently at home.  There are flashbacks to war scenes that one can understand to be affecting the soldier's current behavior, but the flashbacks to the woman are never explained and don't seem to be relevant to the story.  The whole situation at first seems to be rather improbable - two lost American soldiers, deserters, wandering all over the countryside during wartime without encountering any Germans except one patrol trying to get captured by the Americans so they can have some food to eat!The story turns more interesting when the soldiers encounter some handicapped children and their caregivers.  In this group they find purpose in their situation when a German patrol comes upon them.  The children must be genuine Romanian orphans or castaways - one boy really has no legs.  Another girl is apparently badly burned so she wears a mask.  In the battle, the more bitter of the two soldiers seems to find his purpose in life at great sacrifice.  However, I found it to be less than satisfying when the second soldier leads the remnants of the children's group to the woods and the movie ends there with his apparent death.  What happened to the children?  I think it would be much more satisfying if he'd recovered and decided to give his life to caring for many war-injured orphans.This is an interesting movie, worth watching.  It, many times, reminded me of the Kurdish/Iranian movie, 'Turtles Can Fly.'  Between the two movies, I prefer 'Turtle' because it is much more realistic and has a very startling climax.

979454,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000EWBKLM,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","Straight Into Darkness is one of the more fascinating war movies because the storyline is different from the norm.  It's about two American soldiers that end up walking through the cold forests and hills of snowy Germany alone during World War II after an explosion kills the rest of the group.  One of the soldiers has a loose trigger and basically forces the other one to tag along and do whatever he says, whenever he wants.  They eventually find a building where children are staying.Now the unique thing here is, these children aren't defenseless- they are specially trained to fight in a war.  It was never really said if they were trained by the older man and woman who also live in the building- all we see are the children acting oddly quiet for an extended period of time not because they're weird, but because they're preparing for a potential German invasion (which does happen, soon in fact).  Apparently the old man and woman are actually French even though they look and sound distinctly British.Having a storyline focus around the children during World War II is a fascinating and welcoming alternative- we're so used to seeing American men battling either the Germans or Japanese that having a storyline focus on the children is a nice change.  I can't really find any sources that say whether this story is fictional but... I think it absolutely has to be.  I'd like to think that, even though I wasn't always the most alert student in history class, that several children being trained to take out a German army would have been mentioned in several history book chapters over the years.  I would have remembered it.The presentation of the movie is really beautiful.  Well I mean, beautiful in a really grim and dreary kind of way, capturing the accuracy of a snowy German forest during such a devastating war.  It's amazingly effective in appearance, and reminds me of Saving Private Ryan (hey whether you like that Tom Hanks movie or not, you gotta admit it *looks* amazing).  My only complaint is that the action is too camera jerky.  By that I mean, you see a shooting/death for a split second, then it immediately switches to another shooting so you can't really absorb the powerful impact of the first death.  A war-hectic segment near the end is a perfect example.  It all becomes a blur.Still, Straight Into Darkness succeeds in telling World War II from a different angle, whether fictional or otherwise.

The movie starts off with 2 soldiers traveling through a Wartorn country. The only real look you have into the personal lives of these soldiers are flash backs from time to time. Matter of fact the brief history of the characters is told throughout the movie in brief cenimatic flashbacks. It's never overbearing as it's only 3-4 secs long, but you have to put the pieces together. One soldiers mind switches between the love of his life he lost back home, and a tragic accident that happened to him in war. The other soldier is battle fatigued he's just plain and tired of playing soldier.  These two roam about trying to figure out where they are untill one day they come across a building that is serving as a shelter for a unique gorup of children. These run away soldiers finally realize they have something to worry about that's more important than them. This movie is pretty interesting mostly the style that it's filmed in.

The movie is set in 1945 at the tail end of the war in Europe. The Americans and their allies have basically won, but not all the troops in the field know this yet. Two American deserters come across a group of freedom fighters that consist of two adults and several children. They are living in an abandoned building in the hills and survive by raiding Germans and stealing supplies. Eventually, a group of Germans surrounds the building and the group must repel wave after wave of Nazi soldiers. I will not give out spoilers, but there is a reason the Germans want to take this building. There is a real beauty to this film. The way it is shot and the music reminds me of early Werner Herzog work. For World War 2 fans, there is plenty of action as well as the Germans and children battle it out for the last 30 minutes of the movie. There is also a beauty to these children (many have some sort of war injury or birth defect) who begin to trust the American soldiers with their lives. This is a great surprise and blows away 90% of the sewage Hollywood churned out last year.

The flow of the story is unconventional; disjointed chronologically. This can be a distraction to some viewers and is a matter of personal taste. The disjointed style is becoming something of a cliche, especially popular in Tarantino flicks. However, Burr takes a ""soft focus"" approach to the disjointed style. That is, there is a regular plot progression, but it is loosened up. The plot is not in the linear tradition, but it takes on a less jarring, more dreamlike sequencing than a Tarantino stlye. Burr's use produces an open ended, weblike chronology.I found that a good framework for the material and erie locations. I happen to like movies that don't take up time explaning everything and leave a little for discussion. It didn't work perfectly throughout, the pacing was a little off sometimes, due to the budget and logistics, no doubt.  Yet I found the story a moving experience. The co-stars were phenomenal.",5,"Moving, imperfect film",1165795200,"12 11, 2006",2006,1098,"['do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'review', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'synopsis', 'i.e', 'spoilers.The', 'style', 'movie', 'similar', 'Michael', 'Almereyda', 'films', 'flow', 'story', 'unconventional', 'disjointed', 'chronologically', 'can', 'be', 'distraction', 'viewers', 'matter', 'personal', 'taste', 'disjointed', 'style', 'becoming', 'something', 'cliche', 'especially', 'popular', 'Tarantino', 'flicks', 'However', 'Burr', 'soft', 'focus', 'approach', 'disjointed', 'style', 'regular', 'plot', 'progression', 'loosened', 'up', 'plot', 'not', 'linear', 'tradition', 'less', 'jarring', 'more', 'sequencing', 'Tarantino', 'stlye', 'Burr', 'use', 'open', 'ended', 'weblike', 'chronology.I', 'found', 'good', 'framework', 'material', 'erie', 'locations', 'happen', 'like', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'up', 'time', 'explaning', 'everything', 'leave', 'little', 'discussion', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'perfectly', 'pacing', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'sometimes', 'due', 'budget', 'logistics', 'doubt', 'found', 'story', 'moving', 'experience', 'co-stars', 'were', 'phenomenal']",Straight Into Darkness
