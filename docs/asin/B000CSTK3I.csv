I was an ""ambulance girl"" at an older age like Kathy Bates in this movie.  I made the same dumb mistakes. When I first started as an EMT I did like she did, went to bed with my clothes on, just waiting for the radio to go off. It brought back so many memories, and was a great part of my life.

962396,ACOY29IAE58HO,B000CSTK3I,Peter Huston,"[0, 0]","I finally saw this and enjoyed it. It is a good portrayal of a woman who, much to her own surprise, becomes a volunteer EMT and finds it a valuable and meaningful experience that broadens her life. It's a drama and it doesn't skirt around the fact that the heroine is in a phase of her life where she needs something more. (It starts and she's watching TV and snacking, unsure of what to do  now that her alcoholic husband has sobered up and is leading a productive life but is often focused on AA meetings and sobriety and recovery.) This, actually, is accurate for many people who become hardcore EMT's. While watching I was reminded a bit of friends' complaints that in Lifetime Network movies the men, especially the husbands are often the bad guys, but nevertheless I thought it was a great film if you want a portrayal of what it's really like to be a volunteer EMT and what sort of people do it. A much better and accurate portrayal than some of the stuff out there. (i.e. the horrible TV show ""Trauma"" -ick! bad medicine, stupid plots and pure garbage.)BTW, I base much of this review on my own experiences as a volunteer and commercial EMT.",4,Good film about a volunteer EMT,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,1149,"['finally', 'saw', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'portrayal', 'woman', 'who', 'much', 'own', 'surprise', 'volunteer', 'EMT', 'valuable', 'meaningful', 'experience', 'life', 'drama', ""n't"", 'skirt', 'fact', 'heroine', 'phase', 'life', 'where', 'something', 'more', 'watching', 'TV', 'snacking', 'unsure', 'what', 'do', 'now', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'sobered', 'up', 'leading', 'productive', 'life', 'often', 'focused', 'AA', 'meetings', 'sobriety', 'recovery', 'actually', 'accurate', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'hardcore', 'EMT', 'watching', 'was', 'reminded', 'bit', 'friends', 'complaints', 'Lifetime', 'Network', 'movies', 'men', 'especially', 'husbands', 'are', 'often', 'bad', 'guys', 'nevertheless', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'want', 'portrayal', 'what', 'really', 'like', 'be', 'volunteer', 'EMT', 'what', 'sort', 'people', 'do', 'A', 'much', 'better', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'stuff', 'there', 'i.e', 'horrible', 'TV', 'show', 'Trauma', '-ick', 'bad', 'medicine', 'stupid', 'plots', 'pure', 'garbage', 'BTW', 'base', 'much', 'review', 'own', 'experiences', 'volunteer', 'commercial', 'EMT']",Ambulance Girl
