1378537,A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,B003ZZ7TMO,"E. Valero ""Eterno""","[0, 0]","If you are a fan of the Howling series, you probably already own these movies. For those who have not seen the many lesser sequels to Dante's excellent 1981 original, all I can say is, watch with caution. None of the films offered here are masterpieces (I would argue that Part V is as close as you're going to get to perfection in the series and even this sequel is far from perfect) and all suffer greatly from the typical elements that plague these types of productions, stiff acting, low budget, inferior effects work and sadly for a werewolf movie, really cheesy transformation scenes. The team for ""Howling V - The Rebirth"" were smart and decided not to visualize what they obviously didn't have the budget to produce.Interestingly enough, this set excludes the fourth film in the series, ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"", and goes from number III to V and VI. In my opinion, these 3 are the better sequels so it's only for the better. For those that would like to watch the awful chapter IV, can purchase it individually. It is recommended since movies this bad are sometimes very entertaining but be warned, it stinks. Now, moving on to the movies included on this DVD.The Howling III: The Marsupials **The second sequel in the series is a wild, sometimes amusing and totally obnoxious film that never takes itself seriously. The main character is the beautiful Jerboa, a marsupial werewolf (who appear to have evolved from the Thylacine) who flees her village and goes to the city where she is cast in a low-budget creature feature. Meanwhile an Australian anthropologist, who has archival film footage from the turn of the century depicting Australian Aborigines sacrificing and killing a werewolf, is convinced the world is being plagued by these hairy monsters. The plot is rather convoluted and although the sequel is amusing at times, it is not always successful as it suffers tremendously from its low budget and childish story. It tries to be creative during its many transformation scenes but they never quite turn out and the werewolves themselves looks rather silly and nowhere near as ferocious as those depicted in Dante's classic. Also, the film is too tongue and cheek so it is not scary in the least. There is no atmosphere, no sense of dread or fear. The original film used horror and humor splendidly while ""Howling III"" over-does it and is more of a parody than an actual horror movie. If you view this as campy entertainment, you may be entertained by it. Definitely do not view this expecting a horror film. If it's horror and shocks you want, you're better off watching a rerun of ""Roseanne"". It is definitely superior to the atrocious first sequel ""Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf"" and the sequel that followed ""Howling IV: The Original Nightmare"" but overall a very disappointing picture.The Howling V - The Rebirth ***This fifth entry is hands down the best sequel in the series. If you have seen parts II, III and the poorly done IV, do not expect to find that level of awfulness here as the makers of this film actually delivered in making a good, solid who-dun-it with a werewolf twist.The film starts in medieval times as a mass murder/suicide is taking place. As the victims lay dying on the floor of their castle, a baby is heard crying in the background. Fast forward 500 years later and several individuals, ranging from a doctor, tennis player, a struggling actress, a successful actress, a photographer etc, are summoned to attend the re-opening of a glorious castle in Budapest. At first, it is all fun and interesting conversations but it soon turns threatening when some of the guests begin disappearing and those remaining begin to suspect that something sinister is at play. When some of the victims are found with their throats ripped out, the mysterious Count, who summoned them, reveals the true motive for their gathering. They are all descendants from a werewolf bloodline and they all bear the mark of the beast - a birthmark on their arm, and one of them is indeed a werewolf. They were attempting to single out the beast and to kill it before it kills all and to stop the werewolf bloodline.This nifty little shocker is devoid of intense gore and any werewolf transformation scenes but it is without a doubt, the best in the series besides the original. It is obviously a low budget production but the film team didn't have this hinder their imagination and went around their many obstacles and gave us much needed suspense, something terribly lacking in all of the sequels, a very chilling atmosphere, a good, creepy score, and they manage to squeeze some good performances from most of the cast. For the reviewers who criticize this entry for having bad performances must have not seen the previous (""Howling II"" and ""IV"") and later installments (""Howling 7"" is awful on every level). Most of the actors in this sequel are pretty good in comparison and since there is much more character development here, we end up actually caring for some of these unfortunate souls. Many cite the lack of werewolves in the movie as its main problem. I personally do not think this is an issue at all. I would prefer seeing glimpses of the monster, it's claws, it's angry snarl, it's wicked eyes and in one scene, its hairy silhouette complete with elongated fingernails, than an atrocious B-movie monster in all of its low budget, laughable glory. What we do see of the creature, is good and at least ""The Rebirth"" cannot be criticized for displaying for prolonged periods of screen time an awful looking, rubber creature.""Howling V: The Rebirth"" is not as good or as frightening as the original but in comparison to the other sequels, this one shines above them all as a solid piece that is generally well made with some great location shots, atmosphere, suspense and a rather peculiar, surprise ending. It is not perfect since the pacing is a bit slow and when scrutinized, plot holes are evident but these minor issues are easy to overlook when the rest of the sequels are so darn awful. This fifth entry holds up well and it deserves, at least, a view.Howling VI: The Freaks **After a good, solid entry with ""The Rebirth"", the franchise took another nose-dive with ""The Freaks"". Although it is not the worst of the sequels, again, I have to cite II, IV, and VII since they stand out in their awfulness, this entry is still disappointing. It lacks suspense and scares and although this one tries to resurrect the werewolf transformation scene, it does so unsuccessfully and the end result is a werewolf that simply looks like a very tall, ugly man with body hair issues.The story centre's around Ian, a charming drifter who takes a job at a local church. This mysterious loner harbors a dark secret. You see, when the moon is full, he transform in to a hairy sasquatch .. I mean werewolf. Meanwhile, a travelling carnival arrives in town and one of its showcases is its freak-show complete with an alligator boy, a he-she, a three armed man and a clown who likes to chew off the heads of chickens (didn't see that one coming). The owner of this freak-show is R.B. Harker, a tall, masculine blonde with a flowing mane that would look great in a Harlequin romance novel cover and who also has a dark secret of his own. It is revealed that he is a loathsome, evil vampire who unmercifully exploits the freaks he takes under his wing. Harker, who is aware of Ian's secret, and can initiate a transformation by simply chanting some words, uses Ian as part of his carnival freak-show display. The sasquatch, ... I mean werewolf here is the good guy and the climax is a showdown between Good and Evil. The idea is an interesting one and ""Howling VI"" pre-dates the current batch of werewolf vs vampire themed films such as the ""Twilight"" and ""Underworld"" saga. I just wished this had a bigger budget so more could have been accomplished. ""The Freaks"" is ambitious but rather clumsy and there are far too many quirky characters that it becomes a bit tiresome. The transformation scene is better than previous and later sequels, (""Howling II"", ""III"", ""IV"" and ""VII"" had cheesy man-to-wolf transformations), but where this one drops the ball is in the actual snout-less sasquatch... I mean, werewolf. At least give the beast a snout. This is not 1941. In this day and age, even by early 90's standards, we expect more from a cinematic werewolf than some contact lenses and glued on hair.Although far from being the worst, ""Howling VI: The Freaks"" will only amuse those undiscriminating horror fans with low expectations. Which is disappointing considering this had all of the potential of being a great entry in the series.""Howling Trilogy - Triple Feature"" does not include any extras, not even the trailers. All you get are the movies and that's it so do not expect much. The quality of the films are very disappointing. The three movies show their age and unfortunately nothing was done to clean them up. This is especially true of the ""The Rebirth"". The transfer is sub-standard, looks grainy in several parts and the picture quality looks no better than the 20 year old VHS tape I originally had. For the price, I suggest you just get the DVD's since its several dollars cheaper, I wouldn't spend more than $10 on this release. The only one worthy of buying individually if it is ever released in a more comprehensive DVD or Blue-ray, is ""The Rebirth"" but I am not holding my breath. The others, view with caution, but they are certainly entertaining in their own, low budget, B-movie kind of way and you can do much, much worse. ""Howling VII: New Moon Rising"" for example, makes these 3 films look flawless in comparison.",3,Sub Par Sequels Range from Silly to Good with Part V as the Stand-Out.,1382313600,"10 21,

1378538,A1EAMAQ8BSI0LY,B003ZZ7TMO,MacheteJason,"[0, 0]","You get three Howling franchise films on a single disc. The Marsupials is weak but The Freaks and The Rebirth are good (both are considered the best sequels in the franchise). The Rebirth is an overlooked gem. It has great atmosphere, location and some good acting. Unfortunately it doesn't look great on Blu-ray because all of these films need to be remastered or at least retouched. If you are a Howling fan who hasn't seen the films in years then be warned they have aged and can no longer hide their weaknesses. Fans of the original can buy The Howling on Blu-ray also but I prefer The Rebirth now. This set is also available on DVD for half the price. Since the video and audio are little better than VHS you have to do your own research to decide what is right for you. A scary werewolf film has never been made. However, I did enjoy An American Werewolf in London for its humor. This blu-ray trilogy is rated a lowly 2.5 stars on Amazon. Howling, Howling V and VI would have made a better trilogy but the production values in this franchise are average overall (unless you think your sister is a werewolf).
