The directing must have been non-existent - the camera work bounces all over the place (distractingly so) -- the plot is hard to follow.  Glad I did not pay a full price for this - part way through I shut it off... later tried to finish it. Gene Hackman is usually in great movies - in this case, Forget it.",1,Eureka with Gene Hackman,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",2010,408,"['One', 'would', 'imagine', 'fact', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'had', 'played', 'lead', 'movie', 'directing', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'non-existent', 'camera', 'work', 'bounces', 'place', 'distractingly', 'so', 'plot', 'hard', 'follow', 'Glad', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'full', 'price', 'part', 'way', 'shut', 'off', 'later', 'tried', 'finish', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'usually', 'great', 'movies', 'case', 'Forget']",N/A

There are no extras, except for the trailer, which is a shame.To my knowledge, this 1983 film has been screened only very rarely on terrestrial TV -- just once in the UK, for example, in the late 1980s on BBC2. At the time, viewers were given a great intro to the film -- i.e. how it was loosely based on true story, and how it had existed in several versions etc etc. Because of that, I've always felt this was a British film -- with people like Roeg, Jeremy Thomas, Lapotaire and many British actors in minor roles. But most of the major roles are taken by US actors -- e.g. Gene Hackman, Mickey Rourke, Joe Pesci etc.This is the same version as shown on TV -- i.e. with all the gore, nudity and voodoo -- if you prefer to stay away from that sort of thing.  Although Theresa Russell has done many good things, I'm not convinced by her acting in this one.  But at the time, she was one of the most beautiful women in the world, and it is surprising that Roeg is prepared to share so many views of his wife with the cinema-goer.As a plot and an atmospheric experience, I don't think this works as well as say, DON'T LOOK NOW. Once Hackman has been killed, it becomes too much of a courtroom drama. In other words, the climax comes too early in the film. Much is made of women with black hair -- McCann's wife, daughter and the hooker who guides him to the gold. And we have a literal and several figurative gold-diggers. In the end, I don't feel this movie has any grand message for the world, except perhaps the pointlessness of having so much wealth if you don't do anything with it. (Maybe Bill Gates has already seen this.)But I'm glad it's now available, and we come close to having nearly all Roeg's significant work out on DVD.",4,Not quite vintage Roeg,1082073600,"04 16, 2004",2004,1817,"['taken', 'long', 'time', 'be', 'released', 'last', ""'Eureka"", 'available', 'DVD', 'are', 'extras', 'trailer', 'shame.To', 'knowledge', '1983', 'film', 'been', 'screened', 'only', 'very', 'rarely', 'terrestrial', 'TV', 'just', 'once', 'UK', 'example', 'late', '1980s', 'BBC2', 'time', 'viewers', 'were', 'given', 'great', 'intro', 'film', 'i.e', 'how', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'had', 'existed', 'several', 'versions', 'etc', 'etc', ""'ve"", 'always', 'felt', 'was', 'British', 'film', 'people', 'Roeg', 'Jeremy', 'Thomas', 'Lapotaire', 'many', 'British', 'actors', 'minor', 'roles', 'most', 'major', 'roles', 'are', 'taken', 'US', 'actors', 'e.g', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'etc.This', 'same', 'version', 'shown', 'TV', 'i.e', 'gore', 'nudity', 'voodoo', 'prefer', 'stay', 'away', 'sort', 'thing', 'Theresa', 'Russell', 'done', 'many', 'good', 'things', ""'m"", 'not', 'convinced', 'acting', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'women', 'world', 'surprising', 'Roeg', 'prepared', 'share', 'so', 'many', 'views', 'wife', 'cinema-goer.As', 'plot', 'atmospheric', 'experience', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'as', 'well', 'say', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'LOOK', 'NOW', 'Once', 'Hackman', 'been', 'killed', 'too', 'much', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'other', 'words', 'climax', 'too', 'early', 'film', 'Much', 'made', 'women', 'black', 'hair', 'McCann', 'wife', 'daughter', 'hooker', 'who', 'gold', 'have', 'literal', 'several', 'figurative', 'gold-diggers', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'movie', 'grand', 'message', 'world', 'perhaps', 'pointlessness', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'wealth', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'Maybe', 'Bill', 'Gates', 'already', 'seen', ""'m"", 'glad', 'now', 'available', 'come', 'close', 'having', 'nearly', 'Roeg', 'significant', 'work', 'out', 'DVD']",N/A

Druxman ""A Good Story is a Terribl...","[1, 1]","Inspired by the sensational, unsolved Sir Harry Oakes murder case, this tantalizing film from director Nicholas Roeg stars Gene Hackman as one of the world's richest men.  He found his fortune in gold in the wilds of Canada during the 1920s and now (during WW2) resides on a private island in the Bahamas.Passion has gone out of Hackman's life.  His only interest these days is daughter Theresa Russell, but he's disappointed that she has married fortune hunter Rutger Hauer.Hackman is also under pressure from Miami mobsters Joe Pesci and Mickey Rourke to sell them his island, so that they can build a casino.Visually stunning, if somewhat confusing, Roeg's film is filled with fine performances and mystical elements that will compel viewers to return for a second and third look.

This is a very ambitious film that has its' own voice and risks everything to be heard. There's no other film I can compare, although I find the style of the great masters within its' weave; Hitchcock's subjectivity, Welles' bold strokes, Antonioni's ambiguity, Bergman's reflection and Roeg's own passion for life by intercutting sex, alcohol, mysticism, ritual, poetry and everything in between. Roeg also risks alienating our sensibilities by following the path of our protagonist from act one to act two and then shifting to the journey of two other protagonists from act three to the final frame.Eureka is exciting cinema!",5,vulgar,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,983,"['Vulgar', 'colours', 'vulgar', 'world', 'exaggerated', 'disorienting', 'scenes', 'violence', 'gruesome', 'murder', 'symbolism', 'overtly', 'obvious', 'quietly', 'subtle', 'moments', 'cinematic', 'beauty', 'moments', 'kinetic', 'energy', 'interwoven', 'portray', 'madness', 'passion', 'people', 'philosophy', 'greed', 'conflicted', 'personalities', 'very', 'ambitious', 'film', 'own', 'voice', 'risks', 'everything', 'be', 'heard', 'other', 'film', 'can', 'compare', 'find', 'style', 'great', 'masters', 'weave', 'Hitchcock', 'subjectivity', 'Welles', 'bold', 'strokes', 'Antonioni', 'ambiguity', 'Bergman', 'reflection', 'Roeg', 'own', 'passion', 'life', 'intercutting', 'sex', 'alcohol', 'mysticism', 'ritual', 'poetry', 'everything', 'Roeg', 'also', 'alienating', 'sensibilities', 'following', 'path', 'protagonist', 'act', 'one', 'act', 'two', 'then', 'shifting', 'journey', 'two', 'other', 'protagonists', 'act', 'three', 'final', 'frame.Eureka', 'exciting', 'cinema']",N/A
