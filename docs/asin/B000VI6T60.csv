This program is GREAT for beginners and can be done with or without weights. I have recommended it to MANY friends. They have also purchased this video and loved it. I was surprised to sometimes combine the 3 mile walk with a 1 mile walk to go 4 miles.,5,I LOVE the weighted balls!,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",2009,356,"['was', 'very', 'skeptical', 'first', 'do', 'fitness', 'program', 'weights', 'thought', 'body', 'could', ""n't"", 'take', 'program', 'GREAT', 'beginners', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'weights', 'have', 'recommended', 'MANY', 'friends', 'have', 'also', 'purchased', 'video', 'loved', 'was', 'surprised', 'sometimes', 'combine', '3', 'mile', 'walk', '1', 'mile', 'walk', 'go', '4', 'miles']",N/A

I don't use the weights that come with it. I purchased 2 lb. ball weights from my local sporting goods store. They work very well. Or, you can do the workout without the weights. It is still very effective.

I love the pace of each the 3 workout, and by that I mean the pace makes it easy to keep going, (no flight of the bumble bee music) whether you use the 1, 2, or 3 mile. I can use just the three mile, or use them in combinations. You get a lot of bang for the buck with this DVD. The music is nice and soft in the background. I really like the workout weight balls. Yes, some people find them hard to fill and do not like them, but I did fill them (took a bit long) and they work really great - and add a lot of ""umph"" to these workouts.

I managed to fill the weights up with water but they ended up deformed looking instead of the way they look in the video. I did manage to exercise with them but I am not sure how effective they will be. The weights are an absolute rip-off but thankfully the DVD is more than worth the money.

I work up a good sweat with this DVD.  The time flies and before you know it, you've walked 3 miles.  I like the walk-away weights.  When I first filled them with water, they were a little lumpy, but I let them sit on a counter for 2 days, and they were nice and round, very easy to use. Leslie is not always the best at cueing, but this is so easy, you cannot do it wrong. Leslie is very motivating and her sincerity comes across to you. It's nice to see ""regular"" people in the DVD, not just people in great shape. You get out of it what you put into it.

1101677,A2H4IB1N5BMZNG,B000VI6T60,"R. Deniston ""dayspring7""","[3, 3]","I have been trying to lose weight ever since right after I got married. At my wedding I was a loose size eight, two months later I was a size ten, and I am absolutely positive that it was due to taking birth control pills. If anyone tells you birth control doesn't cause weight gain, WATCH OUT! They're just trying to sell you pills.Anyway, I've been doing Tae-Bo for seven years with no results. Billy Blanks is cool and all, but the workout wasn't for me. I tried Leslie's program, and within two months I lost eleven pounds. Since then, I've been averaging a pound lost per week. I know this sounds slow, but most medical personnel say this speed is ideal for keeping weight off. The workout feels great, pure and simple, and you're not wiped out afterwards. It's also fun, because Leslie and the rest of the people on the DVD talk you through it and keep you motivated. I like how Leslie emphasises long lines and good posture, which is nice because it keeps the muscles from getting clumped-up looking.The only problem I have is whenever I use the weights, my one-year-old wants to hold them. I try to placate him with a couple of tennis balls, which doesn't always work. My son is too smart for that, I think. :-)Bottom line: there is no magic weight loss system. You just have to find what works for you, and Leslie's program has been effective for me. She's very positive and nice, too, which is a bonus.",5,Awesome,1221696000,"09 18, 2008",2008,1412,"['have', 'been', 'trying', 'lose', 'weight', 'ever', 'right', 'got', 'married', 'wedding', 'was', 'loose', 'size', 'eight', 'two', 'months', 'later', 'was', 'size', 'ten', 'am', 'absolutely', 'positive', 'was', 'due', 'taking', 'birth', 'control', 'pills', 'anyone', 'birth', 'control', ""n't"", 'cause', 'weight', 'gain', 'WATCH', 'OUT', ""'re"", 'just', 'trying', 'sell', 'pills.Anyway', ""'ve"", 'been', 'doing', 'Tae-Bo', 'seven', 'years', 'results', 'Billy', 'Blanks', 'cool', 'workout', 'was', ""n't"", 'tried', 'Leslie', 'program', 'two', 'months', 'lost', 'eleven', 'pounds', 'then', ""'ve"", 'been', 'averaging', 'pound', 'lost', 'week', 'know', 'slow', 'most', 'medical', 'personnel', 'say', 'speed', 'ideal', 'keeping', 'weight', 'off', 'workout', 'great', 'pure', 'simple', ""'re"", 'not', 'wiped', 'out', 'afterwards', 'also', 'fun', 'Leslie', 'rest', 'people', 'DVD', 'talk', 'keep', 'motivated', 'how', 'Leslie', 'long', 'lines', 'good', 'posture', 'nice', 'muscles', 'getting', 'clumped-up', 'looking.The', 'only', 'problem', 'have', 'whenever', 'use', 'weights', 'one-year-old', 'hold', 'try', 'placate', 'couple', 'tennis', 'balls', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'son', 'too', 'smart', 'think', 'Bottom', 'line', 'magic', 'weight', 'loss', 'system', 'just', 'have', 'find', 'what', 'Leslie', 'program', 'been', 'effective', 'very', 'positive', 'nice', 'too', 'bonus']",N/A
1101678,AT5OLOZBSDYMK,B000VI6T60,Streudel423,"[15, 15]","First, I must say, the price for the entire WATP system here on Amazon is WONDERFUL! I purchased this original system on VHS when it was released through an infomercial about eight years ago for much more. I had never heard of Leslie before purchasing WATP; however, I'm now a huge fan! I own over a dozen of her workouts now.I think these videos have the best ""group of walkers"" over many of the other Walk at Home videos. It's a energetic, diverse group. One thing I love about Leslie's videos is that she has ""normal"" people walking with her: not everyone is a size 0 and perfectly toned. The majority of the women have curves and appear healthy, not stick thin. This factor is very encouraging to me.I am a college student, but I have a difficult time with high impact exercise because of low arches in my feet. These videos get my heart rate up and make me sweat. I normally wear a heart rate monitor and burn 500-750 calories per workout with Leslie's videos. I've always seen awesome weight loss results. When I lost the majority of my weight several years ago, Leslie's videos were the key for me. I was amazed at how easy the choreography was, yet how great the results were. I weighed close to 165 pounds before using the WATP videos. I now range somewhere between 140-145 lbs.I'm a regular exerciser, but when I feel I need to lose those few extra pounds that have crept up on me, Leslie's videos ALWAYS do the job. There may be no true ""quick fix"" to weight loss, but the WATP videos are certainly close, in my opinion!--The Mile 1 video is very basic and extremely low impact. It introduces the four basic Walk at Home moves: walking (or marching) in place, kickbacks (hamstring curls), knee lifts, and side steps. The 1 Mile lasts approximately 20 minutes. It's great for beginners or for an extra ""evening exercise"" boost for the regular, intermediate exerciser. Sometimes I use a 1 mile workout later in the day, after I've done my longer workout in the morning. The mile 1 workout really doesn't make me work up a sweat but does get the edorphins flying.--The Mile 2 video lasts approximately 30 minutes. Great for a more intense workout in a short amount of time. You'll definitely dig into fat burning with this workout.--The Mile 3 workout is 45-50 minutes. It's a definitely a calorie burner. Leslie uses weights for a longer period in this video, as well, which really ups the intensity.Each video features a ""mile meter"" at the bottom of the screen which indicates how far along you are in 1/2 mile increments.If you choose to purchase the workout separately, there's no need to worry about purchasing the Walk Away Weighted Balls; you can simply use 1-3 pound hand weights.This is a wonderful system for all ages and fitness stages. If you are new to Leslie's Walk at Home programs, this system is a great place to start!",5,These are classic!
