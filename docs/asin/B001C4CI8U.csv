Walter the mad scientist is endearing as well as equally eccentric with a past full of questions. Olivia the FBI agent and Peter (Walter's son)are very likeable characters. Olivia is mysterious and slighty sullen while Peter is light hearted and a bit cynical.

1174278,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B001C4CI8U,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","'Aha! An X-Files ripoff' I said to myself after watching the first few episodes. But it's more than that. Add a little bit of 'Heroes', stir well or not so well and, depending on which episode you're watching you may find traces of 'Silence of the Lambs', Stephen King's 'Dark Tower', Men in Black, Ringu, FeardotCom, a lot of '24' and who knows what else? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and if the maker's claims of extraordinary insights and originality can be ignored, watching FRINGE can be quite entertaining, most of the time. For as long as you don't mind the ""we are the government and we are here to help you and shoot a lot of people in the process"" not so subtle subtext plus the ""be VERY afraid of hostile and dangerous people hiding under your bed"" subliminal message. And the implicit and sometimes open praise of the great and resourceful militaristic-surveillance-police state. And if some of the 'science' doesn't make you laugh rather than scare you or 'wow' you.So... the plot. Of course I'm not going to discuss details but we are talking one nice lady FBI agent and her partner who is not FBI but some civilian contractor (see? why claim it's an X-Files ripoff?) investigating all kinds of strange and bizarre occurrences. And their program is NOT called the X-Files, it's called FRINGE. And, yes, she does have to live with the consequences of some 'treatment' she was subjected to... but I will not go any further. Watch and learn or rather be amused. Add a recovering but still seriously troubled scientific genius who loves making incisions or sticking long needles in live bodies and chopping corpses so that the viewer appetite for 'gross' and 'shocking' is fully satisfied and... FRINGE is not that bad. In other words it's generally watchable, unlike most of the more recent TV series.The technical merit is so-so. Probably half of the action is shot either at the FBI site (office floor) or the mad scientist's lab complete with live cow and cute assistant - indoor scenes. Not too many special effects other than some cheap CGI - man turns into giant porcupine or man's face melts. The sound track on the Blu version is only a modest Dolby 5.1 and the picture quality on Blu is not much better than a DVD's. The extras are mostly about 'how and why did we do this' plus some scientists uncritically praising whatever 'ideas' and extraordinary insights could be derived from some of the episodes. I also didn't like the menu system much - on my PS3 it starts playing as soon as you put the disc in and it's harder to make the player do what I want than in most other movies on Blu discs - Season Two has addressed the problem which is a good thing.All the TV series that I watch I buy because I don't watch TV, having a strong allergy to commercials and in the case of FRINGE I bought the first 2 seasons. Now, after watching Season One and a couple of episodes from Season Two I'm not sure that I'll go for subsequent seasons. It's likely that I might if the price is in the 20's because they are cheap and, in spite of everything that I wrote so far possibly giving the impression of 'bad', there is SOME entertainment value in the series. It's just not as 'brilliant' or 'breakthrough' as its makers and promoters would want you to believe it is.For the time being, it's a 3-star (it's Okay) because I did watch it from beginning to end and stayed (technically) awake while watching it. It's not awesome or 'thought provoking' but it can be funny in some peculiar way. Sadly, it's not likely that I'll be watching FRINGE for a second or a third or n-th time the way I am watching the first 4.5 seasons of LOST (is there a way to erase seasons 5 and 6 from memory?), The Sopranos, Rome or the first couple of seasons of Heroes or Prison Break or... the X-Files. Hopefully, 'Season Two' gets better.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4,"FINXFIN (Fringe is NOT X-Files, it's not)",1307404800,"06 7, 2011",2011,3888,"[""'Aha"", 'X-Files', 'ripoff', 'said', 'myself', 'watching', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'more', 'Add', 'little', 'bit', ""'Heroes"", 'stir', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'depending', 'episode', ""'re"", 'watching', 'may', 'find', 'traces', ""'Silence"", 'Lambs', 'Stephen', 'King', ""'Dark"", 'Tower', 'Men', 'Black', 'Ringu', 'FeardotCom', 'lot', ""'24"", 'who', 'what', 'else', 'Imitation', 'sincerest', 'form', 'flattery', 'maker', 'claims', 'extraordinary', 'insights', 'originality', 'can', 'be', 'ignored', 'watching', 'FRINGE', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'most', 'time', 'as', 'long', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'are', 'government', 'are', 'here', 'help', 'shoot', 'lot', 'people', 'process', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'subtext', 'be', 'VERY', 'afraid', 'hostile', 'dangerous', 'people', 'hiding', 'bed', 'subliminal', 'message', 'implicit', 'sometimes', 'open', 'praise', 'great', 'resourceful', 'militaristic-surveillance-police', 'state', ""'science"", ""n't"", 'make', 'rather', 'scare', ""'wow"", 'you.So', 'plot', 'course', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'discuss', 'details', 'are', 'talking', 'one', 'nice', 'lady', 'FBI', 'agent', 'partner', 'who', 'not', 'FBI', 'civilian', 'contractor', 'see', 'why', 'claim', 'X-Files', 'ripoff', 'investigating', 'kinds', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'occurrences', 'program', 'NOT', 'called', 'X-Files', 'called', 'FRINGE', 'yes', 'have', 'live', 'consequences', ""'treatment"", 'was', 'subjected', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'further', 'Watch', 'learn', 'rather', 'be', 'amused', 'Add', 'recovering', 'still', 'seriously', 'troubled', 'scientific', 'genius', 'who', 'making', 'incisions', 'sticking', 'long', 'needles', 'live', 'bodies', 'chopping', 'corpses', 'so', 'viewer', 'appetite', ""'gross"", ""'shocking"", 'fully', 'satisfied', 'FRINGE', 'not', 'bad', 'other', 'words', 'generally', 'watchable', 'most', 'more', 'recent', 'TV', 'series.The', 'technical', 'merit', 'so-so', 'Probably', 'half', 'action', 'shot', 'either', 'FBI', 'site', 'office', 'floor', 'mad', 'scientist', 'lab', 'complete', 'live', 'cow', 'cute', 'assistant', 'indoor', 'scenes', 'Not', 'too', 'many', 'special', 'effects', 'other', 'cheap', 'CGI', 'man', 'giant', 'porcupine', 'man', 'face', 'melts', 'sound', 'track', 'Blu', 'version', 'only', 'modest', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'picture', 'quality', 'Blu', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'mostly', ""'how"", 'why', 'did', 'do', 'scientists', 'uncritically', 'praising', ""'ideas"", 'extraordinary', 'insights', 'could', 'be', 'derived', 'episodes', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'menu', 'system', 'much', 'PS3', 'playing', 'as', 'soon', 'put', 'disc', 'harder', 'make', 'player', 'do', 'what', 'want', 'most', 'other', 'movies', 'Blu', 'discs', 'Season', 'Two', 'addressed', 'problem', 'good', 'thing.All', 'TV', 'series', 'watch', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'TV', 'having', 'strong', 'allergy', 'commercials', 'case', 'FRINGE', 'bought', 'first', '2', 'seasons', 'Now', 'watching', 'Season', 'One', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Two', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ll"", 'go', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'likely', 'might', 'price', '20', 'are', 'cheap', 'spite', 'everything', 'wrote', 'so', 'far', 'possibly', 'giving', 'impression', ""'bad"", 'SOME', 'entertainment', 'value', 'series', 'just', 'not', ""'brilliant"", 'makers', 'promoters', 'would', 'want', 'believe', 'is.For', 'time', 'being', '3-star', 'Okay', 'did', 'watch', 'beginning', 'end', 'stayed', 'technically', 'awake', 'watching', 'not', 'awesome', ""'thought"", 'provoking', 'can', 'be', 'funny', 'peculiar', 'way', 'Sadly', 'not', 'likely', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'FRINGE', 'second', 'third', 'n-th', 'time', 'way', 'am', 'watching', 'first', '4.5', 'seasons', 'LOST', 'there', 'way', 'erase', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'memory', 'Sopranos', 'Rome', 'first', 'couple', 'seasons', 'Heroes', 'Prison', 'Break', 'X-Files', 'Hopefully', ""'Season"", 'Two', 'better.', '>', '>', 'Brush', 'teeth', 'law', 'lt', 'lt']",Fringe: Season 1

1174315,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B001C4CI8U,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[0, 0]","A commercial airliner arrives at its destination with every passenger and crewmember on board dead. The FBI investigate. Clues suggest that the only person who can help with the investigation is a brilliant but disturbed scientist named Walter Bishop. Bishop has been locked up in a mental institution for seventeen years and the only person who can sign for his release is his son, Peter, a shady businessmen. FBI Agent Olivia Dunham and the Bishops successfully discover the answer to the mystery, encouraging the FBI to create a special unit dedicated to these 'fringe science' cases, which have exploded in frequency in the last few years. The cases are varied and individual, but together form 'the Pattern', a statistical trend that suggests a major event is coming.It's easy to dismiss Fringe because of misconceptions. A new TV show from the creator of Lost, J.J. Abrams? And a premise that seems to owe rather a lot to The X-Files? The number of people who passed the show by, fearing (fairly or not) muddled mythologies and an inferior homage to an older show, must have been significant.However, such reactions would also be unfair. Fringe distanced itself almost immediately from Lost by having a much smaller cast of characters, meaning a much tighter focus on the stories and the gradually-evolving backstory. Abrams also took a back seat after the pilot, letting other writers and producers come on board to direct the day-to-day running of the show. A key difference is that whilst Lost's mythology only got some direction in its third season, when an end date for the show was set, Fringe's mythology and story arcs were mapped out in advance from early in the first, giving the show a much stronger sense of direction.The season kicks off with the pilot, in which the regular cast and premise is established. Anna Torv immediately impresses as Olivia Dunham, a no-nonsense FBI agent (though prone to unexpected bouts of deadpan humour) who has a lot of pressure riding on her shoulders. Joshua Jackson takes a little longer to convince as a businessman with shady contacts, but eventually turns in a very human and funny performance. The main weapon in the show's arsenal is the spectacular John Noble - previously best-known as Denethor on the Lord of the Rings movies - who plays Walter Bishop to perfection. Character traits and tics that would have been hokey or hammy in another actor's hands become utterly convincing in Noble's, who is able to play his character's memory problems and occasional emotional outbursts for either comedy or pathos as the script demands (occasionally both simultaneously). It's frankly worth watching the show just for Noble's performance. Also providing able support is The Wire's Lance Reddick as Dunham and company's boss, Philip Broyles.The show's premise - that the FBI would employ a certified lunatic, an occasional criminal and a cow called Gene to investigate fringe science cases from a basement in Harvard University - takes a bit of swallowing. The show does its best in the pilot to try to make the premise a bit more palatable, but it's surprisingly late in the episode before 'the Pattern' and the great urgency to find out what the hell's going on (making it a bit easier to accept the desperate lengths the FBI are going to) is more firmly established.That out of the way, the show quickly establishes a format: the mystery-of-the-week is laid out in the pre-credits sequence and our heroes rapidly show up to investigate, usually involving labwork from Walter and good old FBI fieldwork from Olivia. The procedural aspect of the show was apparently key to getting it on the air - the producers deliberately used it to entice Fox on board - but it's not too many episodes before it's being downplayed in favour of the crazy lab antics. These episodes also hit that early X-Files sweet spot of having (mostly) satisfying, self-contained stories with more serialised elements being laid down in the background.It's not too long before Fringe's serialisation and mythology comes to the fore later in the season. A recurring enemy is established early on, followed by another, more dangerous one later on. Walter's memory loss, initially established for comedic purposes, later becomes far more important as Walter begins to discover the ramifications of experiments he conducted twenty years earlier. A key episode reveals that Olivia herself may be part of 'the Pattern' and the discovery of a manifesto belonging to a terrorist organisation spurs events in the series finale. Watching over events is a strange bald man in a suit and hat, who appears (if only fleetingly, or in the extreme background of some scenes) in every single episode and is more strongly featured in two of them. An off-the-cuff reference to quantum theory in one episode sets up a major storyline that emerges in the finale and provides the season with its final and most famous cliffhanger image.This segueing from the stand-alone elements to the more-heavily serialised storylines is well-handled, though some may lament the decreasing frequency of the stand-alone mysteries in the late season. At its best Fringe is a surprisingly gory homage to The Twilight Zone, but at its worst can be trite and predictable (though allegedly the worst episode of the season was actually cut, showing pleasingly surprising creative integrity). Fortunately it's worst is very rarely encountered. Slightly more problematic - though perhaps unavoidable in these kind of shows - is the number of times that major reversals and deaths could have been avoided if the characters just stopped and talked to one another properly for a few minutes. Whilst far less of a problem than on Lost, it still niggles when Walter says something cryptically vital, Peter notices but then gets interrupted by Olivia and doesn't bother to raise the question again at the end of the scene.Overall, the problems are few and outweighed by the positives. Season 1 of Fringe (****) starts off as a finely entertaining slice of SF hokum before being carried by excellent performances and a reasonably compelling central storyline into a finale that leaves one eager to move immediately onto the second season.",4,A highly promising start to the series,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",2013,6214,"['commercial', 'airliner', 'destination', 'passenger', 'crewmember',

They hit the deck running and pull no punches so it does not take long to realize if you want to watch the series or not.We start out with an inexplicable and mysterious problem.  The public can never know but there may be some sort of diabolical cabal behind this problem. FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is recruited to help track down the culprits. She is out of her depth in the science behind the problem and needs the help of an extraordinary institutionalized scientist Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) to help decipher the problem.  Unfortunately Walter is not allowed to go out by himself so Olivia must also recruit his son Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) who also helps her and us interpret Walter's thoughts and fringe technology.""Fringe"" uses the standard go on forever series formula.  First there is the immediate episode problem it either starts out at the front end or gets built up very shortly then we have our antagonist(s) usually temporary for this episode.  We usually find that he has a good excuse to be a bad guy and we can empathize but they have to clean up the situation and live happily ever after.  Laid over this is the extended series problem we get everything from vague hints to gratuitous gore.  The antagonists (some likably evil) for the series sections may or may not die can mysteriously be written to come back and whose purposes are never totally explained so that we must watch the rest of the series.  The advantage of having a ""Fringe"" sci-fi theme is that when they paint themselves into a corner the next episode just rewrites from another angle as if the corner never existed; this way we have multiple seasons without any problem of having to tie up loose ends or lose main characters.You can buy the season separate or in different bundles.

A SF series is only as believable as is the basic (college level) science. And that is not the case here. Quite a number of basic scientific facts are plainly wrong. And since they are stated by Dr Bishop (a genius with a 190 IQ), this really hinders my acceptance of the fringe science. Also, fringe science should remains credible, which is sometimes hard... E.g. a gigantic wormlike virus? You don't say! A virus is an RNA string, it has no ""flesh""... How bogus can it get? This is like 50s SF of the worst kind (such as gigantic amoebae...).The pilot is probably the worst episode of all: how come Olivia gets what she needs, however far-fetched, without opposition, and sometimes even without asking? She gets Bishop out of a high-security mental hospital cum prison, after 17 years, just like that? And her assistant, junior Astrid, is never astonished by what goes on in Bishop's lab?Typical Abrams stuff, though: a lot of diverted subplot, often reduced to mere hints, some of which become mainline, others to dwindle and vanish ...

1174330,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B001C4CI8U,brainout,"[0, 0]","EDIT: Something happened to the writers, in Season 4.  They lose plot direction.  Even so, the momentum from all the prior plotlines made Season 4 tolerable until Episode 19.  They totally break with the plotline style at that point, suddenly plunge you over 20 years into the future, and become cheap.  I'll finish watching the series anyway, but at this point (I stopped to edit this review after the first 2 mins. of Episode 19), the series has lost its punch.Prior to this point, it can rightly be classified as one of the best series ever made.  Great continuity and long-term plot, hitting on all the questions we need to think about.  I don't want to give away the story, so will just say it's more than worth one's time, to watch and own.  The script and acting are so good, you'll want to watch over and over again.Original review, follows below (based on the first few episodes.===============Got to disagree with the two most helpful reviews in one respect:  the story hooked me from the start, which I didn't expect.  Was only looking for something to watch while shopping in Amazon.  Normally I don't like cop shows, and I expected this to be one.  But really, it's far beyond that.  The longterm plot is told from the very beginning, and the question of the series is posed at the very end of Episode 1, with a second-time-dying John Scott, asking its question:  who are you really working for?The question matters, for in real life the battle against terrorism has many variant plot lines.  We all think and with reason, that the Muslim jihadists are out to remake the world in Mohammed's image.  Mohammed was a terrorist; the Koran glorifies him for that.Yet as in any violence, there are many other players who manipulate the ones actually doing the terrorism, for their own ends.  For there is money to be made in terrorism.  In the real world, you used to have Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Libya all jockeying for kingship in manipulating the jihadists;  Syria was trying to manipulate, Iraq;  it still is trying to do that.  But now, Libya and Iraq are gone, as POLITICAL centers.  The Jews are used as targets, but not really because Saudis and Iranian leaders want Israel dead.  What they want, is control over their own people, and they use Israel as a tool to keep their own populations looking outside to an enemy, so as not to perceive the enemy within.  Saudi plays good cop, and Iran plays bad cop.  So the Saudis pitch themselves as friends to the West, and Iran pitches as an enemy.  Both are enemies.  And we know that.All this is something you can learn easily:  I learned it 30+ years ago from the State Department;  it's not classified information.  This kind of information is made public, partly in an attempt to get the Middle East to realize the game, is not unknown.  Idea is to save lives.  Since you can trace the information live in public (i.e., newspaper ads the Saudis took out when the Road Map was explained by Dubya), you know you're not being lied to, by the State Department.Okay, so if you wanted to get 'behind' all this jockeying, you have to play along, too.  You have to infiltrate not only the Arab groups and the upper echelons of the Muslim governments, you have to also be involved with those making and selling the variant weapons to the end pawns in the game, the jihadists.  So you have to actually ALLOW the weapons to be made and used, in order to track down the users.  Which means, there have to be corporations making the weapons, selling the weapons, and you must allow them to do that, or even FUND them to do that.  So there will continue to be victims, attacks, dying which also is allowed, so to get eventually to the heads and lop off the heads.  That still won't stop terrorism, but it will derail it, for awhile.This is all one can do, to fight terrorism.  It's a horrific battle, and it never ends.  If you are a Christian, use 1John1:9 and pray to Father in Son's name to expose the terrorists and their backers, so to end it.  All the diplomatic and espionage manuevering in the world cannot stop it.  This phenomenon, so far as I can determine, arises about every 430 years, going back to Mohammed's rise.  So the Christian needs to be informed.  Everyone else needs to be informed as well, but since they don't yet believe in Christ, they are powerless to stop this.  So it's our job to be informed, and to pray intelligently.  So it's our fault, if we don't do our job.So this story angle in FRINGE, is timely and apt.  The premise of its story is terrorism, and how to combat it.  They make that theme plain, from the start.  But it's an odd sort of terrorism, one which dabbles in fringe science, and you're told that, too.  So the series explores the effects of fringe science, assuming it works.  So too, how to combat or 'catch' that science.  Standard big-evil-corporation longterm plot, doesn't mar the series, which surprises me.Why is this series so engaging?  The script and actors.  The film editing.  Timing, little snippets of humor now and then.  Sub-plot twists.  The overall BIG STORY of what if there were a network of terrorists experimenting with fringe science on the entire planet.  If I had to classify it, I'd say it was a mix of Warehouse 13 and your standard conspiracy show.I don't see the FOX interference claimed in the reviews, for Episodes 1-3.  But I don't doubt the claim.  It just doesn't inhibit the storytelling, to my mind.Series is superbly cast.  Good chemistry between the characters, or good camera in establishing chemistry, not sure which.  Probably both.  I don't know how they managed to get the viewer so hooked into the story so well from the beginning, without a lot of backstory.  But I did get hooked.One of the reviewers said this show is the new LOST, so that too is why I'm watching it.  Glad to know it runs five seasons.  Am not sure yet if it's still running, must investigate that.If it matters, to me the purpose of watching series like this, is to think out ideas.  Those ideas don't have to be true or even correct;  they just have to be plausible.  Since no one knows enough to say categorically that certain 'fringe' ideas CANNOT work, those ideas should be played out.

And the 1st season DVD box set is equally good.The DVD episodes are a little longer, & have more content than those seen on T.V.  I know because I recorded the TV episodes & removed the commercials.  (I need a life!)It's not a lot more; just little stuff.  On this DVD box set - there's just a teensy bit more content in one or two of the scenes of each episode.  I like this extra stuff very much.  Too bad it wasn't that way on TV, but no worries.One scene has a character who wasn't there in that particular scene when it aired on TV.  In some shots when there's no dialog, the shot itself is a bit longer (e.g. while Olivia is searching the castle dungeon for a kidnapped little boy).Evidence that there's more than one of everything.  ;-)As DVD production staff commentaries go - this is better than average.  The audio commentary by J.J. Abrams and crew is funny, interesting, occasionally educational, and just a pleasure to listen to.  My only complaint was there wasn't more of it.  Only three or four episodes have commentary.  I WANT MORE!Among the many special features is a half-hour long (give or take) documentary on the special effects.

1174351,A2IKWMHSHKRLGG,B001C4CI8U,Carlos A. Melendez,"[4, 7]","I love shows about either supernatural or paranormal activities, so why do I give this show only 3 stars? Well I think it has a lot to do with the actual actors. The actress who play's Olivia I find to be way too wooden, especially in the first episodes. I tend not to believe she has any real feelings for anyone let alone her boyfriend who plays a major part in the pilot. Then there's the ""mad doctor"" as the creators call him in the special features, I find that there are times when the shtick gets a little old. As for Joshua Jackson, well he's not that bad but his smart-aleck responses also tend to get a bit old.But what really bothers me is the amount of disbelief the characters portray even after seeing all the s___t they see. They talk to dead people, combat beasts that are part tiger/snake/bird, teleportation, etc. yet whenever the Mad Doctor has a theory about something it's always, ""That's not possible!"", ""That's insane!"", ""There's no way that could happen!"", ""That's not possible!"" (They say that one a lot). Well after seeing all you've seen and the doctor says it's probably so and so, why not just accept it and move on?In the pilot there's a scene where the police, FBI and SWAT are surrounding a suspect's house yet no one except Peter (Joshua Jackson's character) sees' the guy come out the back? Obviously a scene just there to show that Peter can be an important part of the team.Now I'm not saying it doesn't have it's interesting episodes, especially towards the end and really you can start watching from I believe disc 5 and it's actually more exciting. The first episode of disc 5 actually has an overview of everything that happened before, go figure.I will say this the last shot of the last episode is a shocker, if you have half a brain you will know the big secret before the last episode but you will not expect the last shot, it was genius.All in all I would rent the DVD's and not buy them.",3,It's OK,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",2009,1933,"['love', 'supernatural', 'paranormal', 'activities', 'so', 'why', 'do', 'give', 'show', 'only', '3', 'stars', 'Well', 'think', 'lot', 'do', 'actual', 'actors', 'actress', 'who', 'play', 'Olivia', 'find', 'be', 'way', 'too', 'wooden', 'especially', 'first', 'episodes', 'tend', 'not', 'believe', 'real', 'feelings', 'anyone', 'let', 'alone', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'major', 'part', 'pilot', 'Then', 'mad', 'doctor', 'creators', 'call', 'special', 'features', 'find', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'shtick', 'little', 'old', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'well', 'not', 'bad', 'smart-aleck', 'responses', 'also', 'tend', 'get', 'bit', 'old.But', 'what', 'really', 'bothers', 'amount', 'disbelief', 'characters', 'portray', 'even', 'seeing', 's___t', 'see', 'talk', 'dead', 'people', 'combat', 'beasts', 'are', 'part', 'tiger/snake/bird', 'teleportation', 'etc', 'yet', 'whenever', 'Mad', 'Doctor', 'theory', 'something', 'always', 'not', 'possible', 'insane', 'way', 'could', 'happen', 'not', 'possible', 'say', 'one', 'lot', 'Well', 'seeing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'doctor', 'probably', 'so', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'accept', 'move', 'pilot', 'scene', 'where', 'police', 'FBI', 'SWAT', 'are', 'surrounding', 'suspect', 'house', 'yet', 'one', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'character', 'guy', 'come', 'back', 'Obviously', 'scene', 'just', 'there', 'show', 'Peter', 'can', 'be', 'important', 'part', 'team.Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'have', 'interesting', 'episodes', 'especially', 'end', 'really', 'can', 'start', 'watching', 'believe', 'disc', '5', 'actually', 'more', 'exciting', 'first', 'episode', 'disc', '5', 'actually', 'overview', 'everything', 'happened', 'go', 'figure.I', 'will', 'say', 'last', 'shot', 'last', 'episode', 'shocker', 'have', 'brain', 'will', 'know', 'big', 'secret', 'last', 'episode', 'will', 'not', 'expect', 'last', 'shot', 'was', 'genius.All', 'would', 'rent', 'DVD', 'not', 'buy']",Fringe: Season 1

I did not watch this show again until about half way through the series.  Much to my surprise, I noticed that it had vastly improved and showed potential for the future.  Unlike many tv shows today, this does not have a major film star in the lead.  Assuming the show could get a major film star, the acting would probably be stronger.  Assuming the show can't get a major film star, then the actors they've got aren't worth changing.  They are basically doing the job. Anna Torv as the FBI agent and Joshua Jackson, as the mad scientist's son, are fine. Jackson reminds me a great deal of a young William Peterson (Gus Grissom in CSI), the way he was back in his TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA and MANHUNTER acting days.  If Jackson continues to develop that resemblance, he probably has a lock on this show.The best actor is John Noble, who plays Walter Bishop, the insane scientist who has been locked up in a mental institution for years.  The government now needs Walter Bishop because there are many strange things happening and he is the only person who may be able to figure it out.  If you remove this character/actor from the show, it would be like driving a stake through its heart.  He is critical to it.  He is also the only character with humor so far and these shows need comic relief in order to succeed.As I've come to grasp the essence of the show, leading edge scientific experiments have led to certain people being able to bend the dimensions of the universe, such as space, time, etc.,  Odd things are happening all over, which were at one time beyond the rules of physics.  One can only hope to fight these rips in the fabric of the physics of the universe by using the most brilliant scientist one can find.  Ergo, the use of Walter Bishop. Walter must be tended because he is NOT recovered from his mental break.  Thus, his son must babysit him plus an FBI agent must remain on top of the two of them constantly.The things which keep happening in the present day continue to get weirder and weirder and by the end of the show one is ready for some really big event.  The show delivers and leaves you waiting for season two.

I had read reviews that it was an X files copycat or a rehashing of previous sci-fi shows. Fortunately, I decided to take a chance and I am so thrilled that I did! The show follows FBI agent Olivia Dunham as she tries to get to the bottom of crimes that have a supernatural elements. She is supported by Walter Bishop who is released from a psychiatric clinic in order to work with Olivia on these cases. In the 1970s, Walter was the leading scholar in fringe science which includes topics ranging from telekinesis to teleportation and mind control.Though Walter is brilliant, he is scatter brained and must be managed. Enter Joshua Jackson. Jackson plays Peter Bishop, Walter's son, who is an intellectual con artist. Personally, I think Jackson was born to play this role! Sadly, in the first season he takes a bit of a background seat while letting Torv and Noble shine. By the second season, he has a much larger presence.Some have said that the show starts off slow and bumbles along for half a season or so before getting its sea legs. I understand this assessment but I have to say that I thought the show was gold from the beginning. Unlike other sci-fi shows that merely drops the viewer into the middle of the action, Fringe slowly gets the viewer acclimated with the content before escalating the fantastic elements. Some science fiction gurus may have found this to be boring, but I thought that it made the series extremely approachable and the concepts were not over the top.This show is the complete package. It has a fantastic plot, incredible acting, and some great comedic relief.

1174412,A38FYWJ3V3FLZC,B001C4CI8U,"D. T. Jewett ""Computer Sleuth""","[0, 0]","The series begins slow - and cumbersome.  The characters are ill-defined, the plots are sometimes forgettable - I watched one show and by the middle of it, I couldn't remember the beginning and I couldn't remember what it was about . . . .  and this was with no commercials!  I am thus surprised that this series was not cut off after the first few episodes.The second half of the season kicks in pretty good.  Interesting plots, although the character development remains sparse and unfolds too slowly . . .  but note that the backstory of the characters is a major portion in the long-term plot of this series.The series is really a sequence of connected stories - serialized, if you will.  The writers reveal the story (including the backstory of the characters) slowly - and as a result, the characters are frequently so shrouded in mystery that they became (to me, at least) unimportant.  I sometimes had trouble caring about the characters.I purchased the regular DVD set.  This is a nice transfer that plays very well on my 720p, 42"" TV.  I'm not sure I could tell the difference between this transfer and a Blu-Ray rendering - but I say that without seeing it in Blu-ray.I think the gold standard in this genre is the X-Files, and this first season of Fringe does not measure up to it.  Of course, this may be an unfair comparison, since on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, the X-Files should receive a ""10"".Nonetheless, I rate this overall at four stars.  I'd rate the weak introductory episodes at two stars; but I'd rate second half of the season as five stars.Edited to add:  I've now watched the first four seasons of Fringe.  It builds in intensity from each episode to the next - to the point that by season 4 it has become a really tremendous work with an involving plot.  The characters are great - I've come to care about them so much that I just don't want to let them go . . .  Still to watch season 5.I'm glad that I slogged through the first season.  It has become so enjoyable as it moves forward.Warning . . . this is a series for people who want to connect with their characters; but also for people with brains.

In my opinion, I think what makes this show really good are two things: 1) Throughout the entirity of season one, there is an excellent build up of mythology, conspiracy, character, and story arc that does maintain viewer interest. 2) I think that the main character, Olivia Dunham (played by Anna Torv), comes across as a person who is refreshing, capable, strong and intelligent. In the ""Fringe"" world, I think she is near perfect in her role as the FBI agent involved in investigating the strange events that are part of ""The Pattern"". Honestly, she has become a favorite character of mine and I think she is central to the reason this show is so good.Admittedly, you do need to suspend belief a bit to enjoy this show. I mention this because the science and the circumstances are even more ""out-there"" than shows like the X-Files, etc. But trust me, there's enough good story to really keep you interested. The secondary characters (Walter and Peter Bishop) are quirky, somewhat humorous at times, but they too become likable and interesting. I'll also add that Fringe is a good looking show to watch for the visuals. The scenes and effects, the whole atmosphere of the show is very appealing.Lastly, a fun point to remember while watching Fringe is that once you discover who the Observer is, it's fun to look for (or go back and look for) other appearances of this character in random scenes throughout season one.",5,"Weird science and circumstances aside, this show is pretty good!",1266451200,"02 18, 2010",2010,1603,"['Yes', 'fringe', 'science', 'basic', 'framework', 'show', 'very', 'off-the-wall', 'bizarre', 'out-there', 'still', 'highly', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'show', 'opinion', 'think', 'what', 'show', 'really', 'good', 'are', 'two', 'things', '1', 'entirity', 'season', 'one', 'excellent', 'build', 'mythology', 'conspiracy', 'character', 'story', 'arc', 'maintain', 'viewer', 'interest', '2', 'think', 'main', 'character', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'played', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'across', 'person', 'who', 'refreshing', 'capable', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'Fringe', 'world', 'think', 'near', 'perfect', 'role', 'FBI', 'agent', 'involved', 'investigating', 'strange', 'events', 'are', 'part', 'Pattern', 'Honestly', 'become', 'favorite', 'character', 'mine', 'think', 'central', 'reason', 'show', 'so', 'good.Admittedly', 'do', 'need', 'suspend', 'belief', 'bit', 'enjoy', 'show', 'mention', 'science', 'circumstances', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'out-there', 'shows', 'X-Files', 'etc', 'enough', 'good', 'story', 'really', 'keep', 'interested', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Walter', 'Peter', 'Bishop', 'are', 'quirky', 'somewhat', 'humorous', 'times', 'too', 'become', 'likable', 'interesting', ""'ll"", 'also', 'add', 'Fringe', 'good', 'looking', 'show', 'watch', 'visuals', 'scenes', 'effects', 'whole', 'atmosphere', 'show', 'very', 'appealing.Lastly', 'fun', 'point', 'remember', 'watching', 'Fringe', 'once', 'discover', 'who', 'Observer', 'fun', 'look', 'go', 'back', 'look', 'other', 'appearances', 'character', 'random', 'scenes', 'season', 'one']",Fringe: Season 1

Well... not quite, but not exactly.  First off, despite their similarities, I was very tempted to give this series a 4-star rating because I dislike the fact that the characters cannot solve any of their cases without looking up stuff online or using their cellphones.  The only one who doesn't do this is Walter, and I like him for using his brain better than Olivia (who's mostly driven, but doesn't seem to know much about things, except for the fact that she speaks German and can put a mean fight) or Peter.  Then, there's the thing that they never ever face an administrative-budgetary hiccup.  None at all!  In this economy, and with a government cutting expenses all over the place, how is it they have the money for this group?  I want my representatives at all levels asking questions here!That said, I must admit that it's not a problem for me to sit and watch two episodes back to back every time I can.  The production standards are very high, the plots are twisty enough to not let the viewer a minute's rest, and the thrills are good.  The Pilot was incredibly good and sophisticated, but the second episode didn't live up to the standards set by the first.  However, the ambiance, the characters and Walter's shadowy past (despite his child-like behavior) keep drawing me back to watch the show.  The quality has improved, and even though I find the whole premise about Massive Dynamics a bit contrived, I must admit that it adds to the charm or fascination of the series.  Now... where are those who complained about Avatar being a corporate-bashing film and why don't they come to defend Massive Dynamics?Unlike the X-Files, whose so-called ""mythology"" was haphazardly assembled as the series went along, ""Fringe"" shows up with a complete set of teeth... and that lends it a lot of credibility.

I had always been interested in the concept of the show, but had never actually seen it. After I watched that first one, though... I was hooked.I quickly blasted through the first season, and I'm now well into the second. This is one of those rare shows that grips and keeps me engaged throughout. For any fan of science fiction, I would recommend Fringe- it's fast, fun, and smart. Each episode is marvelously paced, providing a good romp for its 42-50 minute run time. The ideas presented in each show are original and intriguing, providing ample mystery and intrigue, while intelligently tying them into the larger story arc that runs throughout the series. The writers and producers of the show are to be commended, for they are willing to sacrifice fairly major characters (instilling the feeling that nobody is ""safe""), and they never string you along for too long. This isn't a show like ""Lost"", where mysteries are indefinitely put on hold. They will present a good conflict or mystery, and have it wrapped up within a few episodes, providing an immensely satisfying viewing experience- something I rarely get from TV shows.The cast is excellent, with the character of Walter Bishop being my favorite. I've never seen this actor before, but he's fantastic! He does an excellent job of portraying the ""mad scientist"" role. Blessed with a genius level of intellect and an ability to problem solve like nobody's business, he can achieve results that no one else can. These gifts are cleverly balanced against an oft-times ""too"" powerful curiosity, which drives him into morally ambiguous areas. His personality is also an interesting mishmash of charisma and anti-social behavior, and it's clear that the strange machinations of his mind have turned him into one odd duck. Walter's explorations into what has been deemed ""fringe science"" are an exciting experience, to say the least, and this is a show that I would recommend to anybody who likes good drama, and they want to try something a little different from all the typical ""police procedural"" series out there.",5,"My current favorite show, this one has me hooked!",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",2013,2163,"['Fringe', 'finally', 'came', 'Netflix', 'not', 'long', 'ago', 'popped', 'first', 'episode', 'one', 'evening', 'had', 'always', 'been', 'interested', 'concept', 'show', 'had', 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'hooked.I', 'quickly', 'blasted', 'first', 'season', ""'m"", 'now', 'well', 'second', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'grips', 'keeps', 'engaged', 'fan', 'science', 'fiction', 'would', 'recommend', 'Fringe-', 'fast', 'fun', 'smart', 'episode', 'marvelously', 'paced', 'providing', 'good', 'romp', '42-50', 'minute', 'run', 'time', 'ideas', 'presented', 'show', 'are', 'original', 'intriguing', 'providing', 'ample', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'intelligently', 'tying', 'larger', 'story', 'arc', 'series', 'writers', 'producers', 'show', 'are', 'be', 'commended', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'fairly', 'major', 'characters', 'instilling', 'feeling', 'nobody', 'safe', 'never', 'string', 'too', 'long', ""n't"", 'show', 'Lost', 'where', 'mysteries', 'are', 'indefinitely', 'put', 'hold', 'will', 'present', 'good', 'conflict', 'mystery', 'have', 'wrapped', 'up', 'few', 'episodes', 'providing', 'immensely', 'satisfying', 'viewing', 'experience-', 'something', 'rarely', 'get', 'TV', 'shows.The', 'cast', 'excellent', 'character', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'being', 'favorite', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'actor', 'fantastic', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'mad', 'scientist', 'role', 'Blessed', 'genius', 'level', 'intellect', 'ability', 'problem', 'solve', 'nobody', 'business', 'can', 'achieve', 'results', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'gifts', 'are', 'cleverly', 'balanced', 'oft-times', 'too', 'powerful', 'curiosity', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'areas', 'personality', 'also', 'interesting', 'mishmash', 'charisma', 'anti-social', 'behavior', 'clear', 'strange', 'machinations', 'mind', 'have', 'turned', 'one', 'odd', 'duck', 'Walter', 'explorations', 'been', 'deemed', 'fringe', 'science', 'are', 'exciting', 'experience', 'say', 'least', 'show', 'would', 'recommend', 'anybody', 'who', 'good', 'drama', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'typical', 'police', 'procedural', 'series', 'there']",Fringe: Season 1

Don't be fooled by the slow first batch of episodes and how they're so... episodic. It's not so deep into the season before we're clued in that there's some ambitious world-building going down. For this or that reason, I missed out on this series' original run; I'm only now watching FRINGE. I'm kicking myself for having missed out.The surface premise is a familiar one, dating back to THE X-FILES and even further back to KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER. Based out of Boston, the FBI's unconventional Fringe division is tasked with investigating the weird and the unknown. Fringe comprises of FBI Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), shady operator Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and maverick scientist - and Peter's estranged father - Walter Bishop (John Noble). Hands down, Walter is the most interesting character. He once was involved in a top-secret U.S. Army experimental program specializing in the field of pseudo-science, but then a case of manslaughter landed him in a mental institution for seventeen years. Today, he remains a genius even if he'd done lost his mind. He's been sprung and remanded to the Fringe unit and specifically to the custody of his reluctant son. And, by the way, all hail John Noble who is brilliant and utterly delightful as the eccentric, no-filtered Walter Bishop.So what's the significance of deja vu? Why is there a cow in Walter's basement lab at Harvard U? And what is the Pattern? And why is ""destruction through technological progress"" so relevant? In a reality in which corporations have higher security clearances than the FBI, aren't you intrigued by Massive Dynamic (motto: ""What do we do? What don't we do?"") of which shadow seemingly looms over each of the Fringe unit's investigations?

My complaint and why I would say DO NOT BUY is the stupid, annoying navigation.  The disc starts up playing the episodes (after the Federal Warning on all the discs, after trailers on discs 2-5).  Does NOT go to the Menu, giving you a choice.  Pressing Disc Menu does not bring up a normal disc menu.  Instead, all you can do is select the commentary or deleted scenes for an episode, or Play Episode, because it treats all of the episodes on the disc as one episode playing them one right after the other.  People who ALWAYS choose Play All will not have a problem with Fringe because they do not even have to choose Play All.  I support giving them the CHOICE to Play ALL.  However, I, and I suspect most of us, do not have time to watch every episode one after the other without pause.At first, the only way I could get to episodes was to fast forward through all the ones I had watched.  ANNOYING is the nicest word I can use.  Now I have discovered on the BH200 remote that once the first episode starts automatically playing, I can press the TitlePOPUP button to get what I normally get with the Disc Menu button.  I can choose Language, Episodes, and Features.  This is possibly true on other remotes.  Others have posted navigation complaints.Another complaint is that there is no time information for the episodes.  IMDB usually posts this, but they way this disc was authored, with all episodes on a disc being treated as one, makes this impossible.  The only way is to have a stop watch and go to the trouble of using it for each episode.All this make Fringe Season 1 Blu-Ray UNACCEPTABLE.

1174467,A1Y7PVYQ9NOHLB,B001C4CI8U,Jake,"[37, 44]","In 2001, when a little show called Alias hit the airwaves, I was instantly hooked on the creative genius that is J.J. Abrams. Since Alias, Abrams has become a household name for TV and Film geeks worldwide with such gems as Lost, Mission Impossible 3, and Cloverfield under his belt. For months now Fox has been brainwashing its viewers with promos of Abrams's newest TV creation, Fringe. With a reported $10,000,000 spent on the pilot alone, not to mention the eye-catching ""from the creators of Lost"" tagline, expectations have certainly been high for fans and critics alike. Would it, could it possibly live up to the hype? This past Tuesday was our chance to find out.Episode Synopsis:When an international flight lands at Boston's Logan Airport and there are no signs of life, FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham, a scientist, Walter Bishop, and his son Peter uncover a deadly mystery involving a series of unbelievable events. ([...])Right out of the gate, the Fringe pilot makes a strong case for being worthy of all the preceding hype. J.J. Abrams' formula for success is all over this thing and it works:1. A seemingly unknown female lead that will undoubtedly be turned into a star? Check. Australian actress Anna Torv is perfectly cast as FBI Agent Olivia Dunham. She has the strong screen presence and subtle charm needed to be able to carry this series.2. A somewhat has been actor that will no doubt be reinvented into a rising star? Check. Joshua Jackson (aka Pacey) wooed teen girls for years on the 90's WB sensation, Dawson's Creek. Here he gets a fresh new start as Peter Bishop, genius estranged son of Dr. Walter Bishop. I was pleasantly surprised with the depth of Jackson's performance and the welcome comedy relief he brings to the show.3. A mega supporting cast? Check. John Noble plays the role of the eccentric, yet endearing Dr. Walter Bishop. I could almost here Middle Earth nerds celebrating worldwide as they realized this is the guy who played Denethor, Steward of Gondor in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (OK, yeah, I was celebrating, too). Truly, some of the funniest and most engaging scenes are between Walter and Peter Bishop. That's a relationship that I can't wait to see further explored on the show.Lance Reddick (aka as Matthew Abaddon from Lost) brings a welcome mysterious air to the character of Philip Broyles. We find out early on that he works for Homeland Security, but before the episode's end we can't help but wonder who this guy really is.Kirk Acevedo, Mark Valley, Blair Brown, and Jasika Nicole also bring strong supporting performances to this well rounded cast.4. An underlying conspiracy that will only become more mysterious and vague as the show goes on? Check. J.J. Abrams has stated publicly that Fringe will be unlike Lost and Alias in that we will not have to watch every episode to follow the story.  I will believe that when I see it. The introduction to ""The Pattern"" toward the end of the episode seems to hint at an underlying mythology for the series. ""The Pattern"" is sure to be discussed, analyzed, and mulled over to the extent of the ""Dharma Initiative"". What is The Pattern exactly? I don't know and neither do you. That is why we will be back for more. Some may consider this an annoying storytelling device, but I love my TV shows served up complex and mind boggling. Bring it on J.J.!!Fringe is all about exploring fringe science (teleportation, invisibility, time travel, telepathy, etc, etc.). This is where the X-Files feel of the show comes in to play (thankfully J.J. Abrams has also said the show will stay away from aliens). The first scene of the pilot is a shocking and gruesome foreshadowing of what we can expect each week. And what a way to kick off a series! Who doesn't enjoy watching skin falling off of someone's face at 30,000 feet?There were some other subtle touches that I enjoyed from this first episode. The cinematography was breathtaking throughout and if you haven't watched this show in High Definition you are truly missing out! The special effects were top notch and I especially enjoyed the translucent skin one of the characters was afflicted with. The location subtitles for each scene were very innovative. Much like the titles for each new Heroes episode, the location subtitles were imbedded in really cool places throughout the pilot. This is sure to become a unique Fringe trademark that adds a little more creative depth to the show. The mysterious Massive Dynamic Corporation, the yet to be seen CEO William Bell, and COO Nina Sharp's Terminator-like arm were also intriguing additions to the plot. Indeed a viral Fringe website for Massive Dynamic has already launched.No doubt Lost fans are going to be looking under every nook and cranny for connections between the two series. Interestingly enough, the new autopilot system used to land the plane in this episode is referred to as the Pearl System. Maybe a not so subtle nod to Lost's Pearl Station? Although I didn't notice, there are reports online that a few of the infamous Lost numbers make appearances throughout the pilot. While I enjoy such shenanigans, I do hope this is nothing more than J.J. Abrams being all cutesy for his Lost fans. If we find out somewhere down the line that Fringe and Lost are interconnected I think my feeble brain will explode.The only thing working against Fringe is its home on Fox, which has an awful track record of canning great TV shows prematurely. Fans of shows such as Firefly and Drive know exactly what I'm talking about. The buzz and promos certainly lean in the show's favor, but with Fox no show is ever safe. Although I'm sure Fox has already renewed Hole in the Wall for eight seasons. I would love to have seen ABC pick up Fringe and scheduled it next to Lost each week.I was very impressed with the Fringe pilot and afterwards my wife and I shared that look that can only say, ""We've found yet another show to be addicted to"". Great writing, strong acting, and an intriguing plot are sure to keep us coming back for more. The great twist at the end of the episode gives us a taste of the strong storytelling that is sure to come with each new installment. If you missed the premiere you still have a chance to catch up. Sunday, September 14th, Fox will be replaying the pilot at 8/7 central with a preview of the new 24 movie coming in November. You can also watch the pilot in glorious HD at Fox's website.",5,Worthy of the Hype!,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,6434,"['2001', 'when', 'little', 'show', 'called', 'Alias', 'hit', 'airwaves', 'was',

A plane filled with dead people has lands at Boston's Logan airport, her partner is exposed to mysterious chemicals that are slowly killing him (and turning his flesh and tissue transparent) and the only man who can save him and solve the mystery of the plane is a brilliant scientist, Dr. Walter Bishop.  Bishop's name was once spoken of in the same breath as Einstein's and Fermi's, but when his lab assistant was killed in a fire, he was committed to a mental hospital for the criminally insane - where he has remained for the last 17 years. The only way Dunham can get Bishop's help to solve her case and save her partner is to enlist the aid of Bishop's estranged son Peter, a drifter, con man, sometime military contractor and all-around shady character, who she finds in Iraq where he is about to swindle some guys in an oil pipeline deal.And that all happens in the first 30 minutes or so of the 2 hour pilot.  &#34;Fringe&#34; is an amazingly ambitious show - part police procedural, part SF adventure, part philosophy seminar.  It has been called &#34;The X-Files meets Lost&#34;, but I think it is better than either of those shows.  In many ways &#34;Fringe&#34; is the show that &#34;X-Files&#34; wanted to be, before it lost the handle on its own mythology.  That very ambition, and the need to lay out an extensive backstory for both the characters and the universe they inhabit, causes the series to get off the a slightly uneven start, but all of the episodes are good, and by episode 4 the show really finds it voice.  I just watched the series finale last Friday, and have been rewatching the show on disc since, and I'm happy to say that it all hangs together wonderfully, and that there are things in even the earliest episodes that pay off at the end.  (The second aired episode touches on a theme that will be important throughout the entire series, but that isn't clear until midway through season 2.)  The first season is a great launch to what turned out to be a terrific series.  It is largely made up of standalone episodes, but the mythology is clearly there and building, and almost ever episode has some event, character or subject that advances or comments on the over-arcing story of the season and the series.",5,"Great show, great season, great BD set",1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,2390,"['FBI', 'agent', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'world', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'partner', 'are', 'assigned', 'interagency', 'taskforce', 'led', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'A', 'plane', 'filled', 'dead', 'people', 'lands', 'Boston', 'Logan', 'airport', 'partner', 'exposed', 'mysterious', 'chemicals', 'are', 'slowly', 'killing', 'turning', 'flesh', 'tissue', 'transparent', 'only', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'save', 'solve', 'mystery', 'plane', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'Bishop', 'name', 'was', 'once', 'spoken', 'same', 'breath', 'Einstein', 'Fermi', 'when', 'lab', 'assistant', 'was', 'killed', 'fire', 'was', 'committed', 'mental', 'hospital', 'criminally', 'insane', 'where', 'remained', 'last', '17', 'years', 'only', 'way', 'Dunham', 'can', 'get', 'Bishop', 'help', 'solve', 'case', 'save', 'partner', 'enlist', 'aid', 'Bishop', 'estranged', 'son', 'Peter', 'drifter', 'con', 'man', 'sometime', 'military', 'contractor', 'all-around', 'shady', 'character', 'who', 'Iraq', 'where', 'swindle', 'guys', 'oil', 'pipeline', 'deal.And', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', '2', 'hour', 'pilot', '34', 'Fringe', '34', 'amazingly', 'ambitious', 'show', 'part', 'police', 'procedural', 'part', 'SF', 'adventure', 'part', 'philosophy', 'seminar', 'been', 'called', '34', 'X-Files', 'meets', 'Lost', '34', 'think', 'better', 'shows', 'many', 'ways', '34', 'Fringe', '34', 'show', '34', 'X-Files', '34', 'wanted', 'be', 'lost', 'handle', 'own', 'mythology', 'very', 'ambition', 'need', 'lay', 'out', 'extensive', 'backstory', 'characters', 'universe', 'inhabit', 'series', 'get', 'off', 'slightly', 'uneven', 'start', 'episodes', 'are', 'good', 'episode', '4', 'show', 'really', 'voice', 'just', 'watched', 'series', 'finale', 'last', 'Friday', 'have', 'been', 'rewatching', 'show', 'disc', ""'m"", 'happy', 'say', 'together', 'wonderfully', 'are', 'things', 'even', 'earliest', 'episodes', 'pay', 'off', 'end', 'second', 'aired', 'episode', 'touches', 'theme', 'will', 'be', 'important', 'entire', 'series', ""n't"", 'clear', 'midway', 'season', '2', 'first', 'season', 'great', 'launch', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'terrific', 'series', 'largely', 'made', 'standalone', 'episodes', 'mythology', 'clearly', 'building', 'almost', 'ever', 'episode', 'event', 'character', 'subject', 'comments', 'over-arcing', 'story', 'season', 'series']",Fringe: Season 1

But it's not supposed to be this obvious. Example: ""As you know, I've been in a mental hospital for the last 17 years."" Well, if the characters know that about each other, why is that dialogue in the show? Answer: For the listening audience. Any time you have characters explaining in painstaking detail who they are or what they think or how they got the knowledge they have, you're walking on very thin ice creatively speaking. Obvious exposition is the mark of a sloppy writer.And this show is full of such writing. Characters can't go five minutes without reminding the listening audience who they are or what they're doing.What's more, someone should let J.J. know that extreme close-ups and jerky camera motions are irritating, not exciting. Jerky camera movements are the calling card of the trying-too-hard-to-be-hip cinematographer. Ten years from now, people will look back on this style and say, ""What were they thinking?"" For now, viewers have to endure it on TV and in the theater.I don't get Fringe. It's supposed to be about the paranormal, the unexplained, the creepy. It's not.

It's like The X-Files meets The Matrix - but without the finesse of either.When you take away Walter's wild-eyed penchant for solving the unsolvable, his son's wisecracking banter, and the blonde cop's looks (but woeful lack of actual detective work), you have nothing. You have a TV series that wants really, really badly to be clever, but isn't. I'm not sure what people see in this. We'll keep watching Season One.

1174519,A1ZJJWF69R31ZL,B001C4CI8U,"Kate Fredericks ""Kate""","[1, 2]","Which means you already know what I think of this simply amazing, too good for TV scripted show that NOBODY is watching, hence I get, I think 11 more episodes until my heart is once again broken as I salute the end of another absolutely outstanding television show. I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: ""you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment"" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me, as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful show (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years).So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more generous overall than other networks *cough* NBC *cough* for giving us closure (ie:Prison Break). But really, I couldn't say it better than either the TV Guide guy OR the USAToday guy who have shamelessly and bravely stood up for this truly brilliant show (although without ant compensation) - THIS is not Fox's fault. It is our's.After all Fox is a business and has continued to allow the same 3.5 million viewers (paltry in network world) the privilege of this intelligent, exceptional scripted show far longer than the numbers game should have allowed. We all make choices with what little time we have these days - especially in the only demographic that counts which boggles my mind - those 18 - 49ers who are simply too busy raising families, working to pay the bills or attending whatever event or child-centered Friday night delight to watch an original brand new Steven Spielberg offering let alone a simple TV show. No matter that those of us OVER the age of 49 have made our money and probably have more discretionary income to spend on most advertisers wares - but I'm on my weighted soap box again. I think even Fox was hoping that the final season of Fringe would garner more than the usual 3.5 million voters as I read the comments when they announced them. I think even Fox would have liked another year of this wonderfully odd cast and the many stories left to tell about them.But alas, for whatever reasons, we, the People, have spoken and Fringe will soon be no more. Some day, people who could have made a difference now WILL find and watch Fringe and wish they'd watched it when it mattered. So do I.

I've tried to get some friends to watch it, and all of them have said more or less the same: ""I can see the appeal, but I don't have the time to get into it at the moment.""

Conspiracy theories, weird sci-fi stuff, action, twists and turns. But after seeing the entire first season, I just wasn't sucked in.  ""Fringe"" is good, but not great.The first part of the season is too formulaic: weird thing happens, ""Fringe"" investigates, some tense action sequences, some clues about a bigger conspiracy are revealed. This was the first 10 episodes, and I nearly stopped watching.  But others here said to watch the next 10, so I did, but I still do not feel compelled to continue to spend my energy with this. I would like to, I really would, but it's just not there for me.I have a feeling Anna Torv is a good actress, but she is given limited emotions to act. Sort of like Jill Hennessey of Law & Order; you know she's trying to squeeze the juice out of the lines, but it's just not enough. And it's not enough to make me really care about her character. John Noble is fun as Dr. Walter Bishop, and he is fun to watch. I am dismayed how chronically underused Joshua Jackson is as Peter Bishop. His purpose in the series seems to be making sarcastic comments and being the straight man for his odd father. Some hints about a shady past were presented in the first season, but nothing's come of them so far. Joshua Jackson must've been soothed by the writers that he will do more in the series; otherwise I would have quit the role. His character does not inspire much empathy either.Some of the plot twists and revelations are obvious. Some seem too manufactured to be credible. Maybe too much is focused on the plot twists and turns and not enough is focused on the past lives of these characters or how they interact with their outside world to make them more human and likeable and for me to care about what happens to them.I can see why others really enjoy ""Fringe"" and eagerly anticipate the next episode.

I couldn't stand the main character, Olivia Dunham, at first, but I ended up liking her the most by season's end. Same goes for the Walter Bishop character, played by John Noble (of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King fame). He is one crazy mad scientist, but he provides most of the shows laughs.

While superficially the comparison is reasonable, it fails on the whole premise of what is happening in each Fringe episode.  The emphasis of the X-Files was the paranormal, the emphasis of Fringe is fringe science.  I have only seen 6 episodes (more on that later), but Fringe presents things that are not really not too bizarre to actually be discounted only on their ""face validity"".I actually worked with several DARPA programs between 1999 and 2005 as both an adviser and a principal investigator.  When I first attended a DARPA program meeting I thought I was entering a science fiction convention.  I was totally amazed at what was being funded, and how ""fringe"" much of it was (go to the DARPA website and peruse the programs).  In 2002, at a meeting with a DARPA director in an attempt to determine if I wanted to join the agency as a program director I was actually told ""Next week we are going to demonstrate teleportation"".  Of course, my jaw dropped and was finally assured that this wasn't Star Trek and that they were ONLY going to teletransport one atom.  But, this is DARPA.Anyway, Fringe presents DARPAesque things in a rather amusing manner and provides reasonable scientific explanation (obviously set for normal US TV viewer consumption) for what is going on.  Dr. Bishop is the perfect character to pull this off.  Even when I was thinking that this was getting too ""Outer Limits"" his jovial explanation made me say ""why not, maybe?""So, I consider Fringe to be an excellent series and I hope that it continues for at least as long as the X-Files.  My only regret is that I didn't ""find"" the series until it was well past episode 10 in real time, and I found it on [...].  My hope is that FOX will find a way to get me caught up in some manner before the end of the season.

1174608,A1CWV11YOHMXJ2,B001C4CI8U,Nathan L. Baker,"[2, 2]","First off, I'd like to stress that my review will focus mostly on technical aspects of this set: the packaging, the transfer, the menu, etc. I've skimmed some of the other reviews and most of the 4 or 5 star ones give great overviews of the quality of the show itself. When I look here for shows that I like, I tend to want to know about the quality of the set, which helps me decide whether to buy it right away (which I do for quality sets) or whether to wait and get it used (which I do for rush-jobs). I would, however, like to stress my admiration for Anna Torv. For me, she's what sells the believability of this whole idea that is Fringe. Many give much (deserved) praise to John Noble, but I absolutely love Torv and her character Olivia. She's a great strong independent role model, and plays it expertly. Bonus points for pulling off an exceptional American accent!Now, for those who know the show already, you may be on the fence about purchasing the set. As of 8 September 2009, the set is priced at $50.99, and that's not chump change, especially if, like me, you're a college student. To avoid getting too wordy (I already used more than I wanted to in the above section) I'll give a little pro/con list. [Note: I uploaded plenty of pictures to the customer image section to avoid lengthy descriptions).]Pros+ Outer Packaging: The outer slipcase looks great, complete with a lenticular cover giving us 2 cool front cover images. The slipcase is nice in that it retains the look of a regular boxed set (cardboard) while keeping in line with the easy-to-use Blu Ray plastic packaging.+ Inner Packaging: As mentioned above, the inside contains a regular BD plastic case with--gasp--another cover image! I was impressed with this (okay, I'm easily impressed) because usually the slip cover uses the same image as the actual package. Here, we get sometime entirely different than what's on the outside which is a nice change of pace.+ Included is an episode guide booklet, which I was beginning to think was a thing of the past. Fringe's episode booklet does exactly what it should, but also contains nice cast pictures and some critic's blurbs. (See more Pro's info in my uploaded pictures for the booklet)+ The discs, which feature artwork very befitting of the show, are easily accessed in what I like to call the disc ""pages""+ Warner did a great job on the AV transfer. I have an average set up (32"" Samsung 720p LCD, no speaker system to speak of) and so far, the transfer looks just as good as it did upon its HD broadcast+ The special features are about what you'd expect from a J.J. Abrams show; there are a lot of them and they really are interesting--at least as interesting as those on the LOST DVDs. The longer features (between 10 and 20 minutes, I don't recall exactly off hand) are fun and informative, and are in high definition. Besides the lengthier features, every disc has little (1 to 3 minutes) behind-the-scenes videos specific to an episode, also in HD, that provides some insight into a key scene for the given episode. I'm not a fan of commentaries, but 4 are on this set.Con- The lenticular cover wasn't exactly perfect. It looks great, but the actual material seems to have been ""scratched"", which could have occurred during or after production, I don't know. When looking at it straight on it's not noticeable but if you tilt it, you can see any scratches that may be on the material (which I'm assuming is some kind of plastic)-The Gag Reel is a widescreen video, but matted for 4:3 (so basically you have the black bars on the sides of the screen and the top of the screen).- Hmm... I really can't think of any others. I'm trying, too, I promise!Besides my minor gripes about the little packaging imperfections (whether they are a result of transport or poor production) there really aren't any complaints about this package. Whenever I start following a show, I can tell right away whether I'll want to buy it or not. Then I tend to picture what the package will look like, or at least have an idea about how it should be. The Fringe package is about as good as I could have imagined. Its design fits perfectly with the show, which means the people putting it together really cared about it. Although $50 is a little steep, it's a fair price for an extremely inventive series that will be sure to garner many worthwhile repeated viewings.Do yourself a favor and buy this set as soon as you can!

That is not a bad thing, as that series was one of the best Science Fiction series ever. If you replace the alien conspiracy theory with &#34;The Pattern&#34;, and intersperse the weekly scary story, you have a similar format. Harris would be the CSM. And, Broyles would be Skinner. The main characters of Dunham and Peter Bishop would be, of course, Skully and Mulder. Walter Bishop would be the Lone Gunmen all rolled up into one substantial person.I thoroughly enjoy the stories and look forward to seeing the rest.I can see holes in some plots and some items are left hanging, possibly for the future episodes, but I thoroughly enjoy JJ Abrams' creation as much as his more recent &#34;Person of Interest&#34; series.As for the longevity of the series, it is a shame it ended after only a short run, but TV is one fickle world based on viewership and if a few viewers hiccup, the series is in trouble. The weekly scary story was likely too much for many people to watch, so I can see that being an issue.The acting was very good with all major players turning in performances befitting them and the high quality of the story.I look forward to seeing the rest of the series and how Leonard Nimoy is folded in as Dr. Bell.

1174616,A374N6FTIT1A7N,B001C4CI8U,Niugui Cilantron,"[2, 2]","I read a review of Fringe by Orson Scott Card on his website where he rejected the show after only watching the pilot, based primarily on ""poor science.""  I have three problems with this. 1) If I rejected a show based on its pilot, I would never have watched Babylon 5 or X-files.  Even the first broadcast episode of Firefly wasn't one of their better shows. 2) You're expecting good science in a science fiction TV show?  What planet have you been on for the past 50 years?  Is X-files or the original Star Trek or Lost or ... ah heck, what show other than maybe Babylon 5 had good science?  I don't watch science fiction TV shows or movies to learn anything about science.  That's what science fiction novels are for.  I watch them to be entertained. 3) The show tells you right up front it's about ""Fringe"" science, much like the X-files.  Most ""good"" scientists discount ""fringe"" science as ""pseudo-science,"" so, hey, you don't even have to watch the pilot to know you won't like it.The three main characters are Olivia Dunham, an FBI agent; Walter Bishop, a mad scientist; and Peter Bishop, his son.Can Anna Torv  (Olivia Dunham) act?  There's a phenomenon I've observed in many TV shows I think of as ""the misspoken line.""  There's probably a technical name for this, where the wrong word in a sentence is stressed.  It just feels unnatural, and makes you wonder if the actor understands English.  Why would they stress that word?  In the previous sentence, the word ""that"" should be emphasized.  Misspoken lines could be due to the nature of television, where they need to be in a hurry to get the next episode out and they don't have the luxury of refilming everything to get the dialogue perfect.  When an actor has a noticible number of these misspoken lines, she may be accused of being a bad actress.  Personally, in the case of Anna Torv, I think that's being unfair.  Another important element of acting is expressing an emotion which fits both the scene and the character, and I think she does this very well.  Additionally, throughout the series, there's a consistency to her character which makes you believe ""yes, this character would do this (or say this) in this situation.""On a surface level, the character of Peter Bishop seems only to function as the show's Scully, saying that everything that is happening in the show is impossible, and being incorrect.  Also, he translates Walter Bishop's ""mad scientist-ese"" into ""normal English"" for Dunham (and the audience), which is totally unnecessary for more sophisticated viewers.  But there's more to his character than this.  Once you get past the pilot, although he's resentful for having to ""babysit"" his father, you can see that he does actually care for and even love his father.For me, it is the character of Walter Bishop, the show's ""mad scientist"" that makes the show worth watching.  It's not just the quirky non-sequitors, though those help.  Think of Heath Ledger's Joker versus Jack Nicholson's.  Nicholson's is more of a comic book character, whereas with Ledger's, you feel that this is a real person who is truly and genuinely insane.  John Noble's Walter Bishop walks a tightrope between comdey and tragedy.  There's an underlying tension with the character - he might slip into full-blown insanity at any moment, or he might just ask you for some mints.  The only other example I can think of where a ""mad scientist"" is portrayed both this realistically and sympathetically would be Russel Crowe's John Nash in ""A Beautiful mind.""Warning: the show can be a bit gross at times (much like the X-files), so it's not for little kiddies.",5,Mad scientist makes the series,1302307200,"04 9, 2011",2011,3620,"['read', 'review', 'Fringe', 'Orson', 'Scott', 'Card', 'website', 'where', 'rejected', 'show', 'only', 'watching', 'pilot', 'based', 'primarily', 'poor', 'science', 'have', 'three', 'problems', '1', 'rejected', 'show', 'based', 'pilot', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'Babylon', '5', 'X-files', 'Even', 'first', 'broadcast', 'episode', 'Firefly', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'better', 'shows', '2', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'good', 'science', 'science', 'fiction', 'TV', 'show', 'What', 'planet', 'have', 'been', 'past', '50', 'years', 'X-files', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Lost', 'ah', 'heck', 'what', 'other', 'maybe', 'Babylon', '5', 'had', 'good', 'science', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'science', 'fiction', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'learn', 'anything', 'science', 'what', 'science', 'fiction', 'novels', 'are', 'watch', 'be', 'entertained', '3', 'show', 'right', 'up', 'front', 'Fringe', 'science', 'much', 'X-files', 'Most', 'good', 'scientists', 'discount', 'fringe', 'science', 'pseudo-science', 'so', 'hey', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'watch', 'pilot', 'know', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'it.The', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'mad', 'scientist', 'Peter', 'Bishop', 'son.Can', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'act', 'phenomenon', ""'ve"", 'observed', 'many', 'TV', 'shows', 'think', 'misspoken', 'line', 'probably', 'technical', 'name', 'where', 'wrong', 'word', 'sentence', 'stressed', 'just', 'unnatural', 'wonder', 'actor', 'English', 'Why', 'would', 'stress', 'word', 'previous', 'sentence', 'word', 'should', 'be', 'emphasized', 'Misspoken', 'lines', 'could', 'be', 'due', 'nature', 'television', 'where', 'need', 'be', 'hurry', 'get', 'next', 'episode', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'refilming', 'everything', 'get', 'dialogue', 'perfect', 'When', 'actor', 'noticible', 'number', 'misspoken', 'lines', 'may', 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'bad', 'actress', 'Personally', 'case', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'think', 'being', 'unfair', 'important', 'element', 'acting', 'expressing', 'emotion', 'scene', 'character', 'think', 'very', 'well', 'Additionally', 'series', 'consistency', 'character', 'believe', 'yes', 'character', 'would', 'do', 'say', 'situation', 'surface', 'level', 'character', 'Peter', 'Bishop', 'only', 'function', 'show', 'Scully', 'saying', 'everything', 'happening', 'show', 'impossible', 'being', 'incorrect', 'Also', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'mad', 'scientist-ese', 'normal', 'English', 'Dunham', 'audience', 'totally', 'unnecessary', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'viewers', 'more', 'character', 'Once', 'get', 'pilot', 'resentful', 'having', 'babysit', 'father', 'can', 'see', 'actually', 'care', 'even', 'love', 'father.For', 'character', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'show', 'mad', 'scientist', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'just', 'quirky', 'non-sequitors', 'help', 'Think', 'Heath', 'Ledger', 'Joker', 'versus', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Nicholson', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'Ledger', 'feel', 'real', 'person', 'who', 'truly', 'genuinely', 'insane', 'John', 'Noble', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'tightrope', 'comdey', 'tragedy', 'underlying', 'tension', 'character', 'might', 'slip', 'full-blown', 'insanity', 'moment', 'might', 'just', 'ask', 'mints', 'only', 'other', 'example', 'can', 'think', 'where', 'mad', 'scientist', 'portrayed', 'realistically', 'sympathetically', 'would', 'be', 'Russel', 'Crowe', 'John', 'Nash', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'mind', 'Warning', 'show', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'gross', 'times', 'much', 'X-files', 'not', 'little', 'kiddies']",Fringe: Season 1

The first episode of the first season of this show is excellent. Unlike Lost (or much better shows like The Wire or Deadwood), there is no narrative arc.  Each episode is self-contained. It's like the X-Files remade for people who never saw the X-files only with worse, less attractive actors and terrible CGI.  (I never saw that show as I disliked it.  Even Gillian Anderson couldn't make me watch it.) And the music of Fringe is directly ripped off from Lost starting with the third episode.  The dialogue and acting are very much boilerplate TV ""drama.""

And boy, am I glad I got it.  I started watching it by myself, then my aunt started watching them with me, then my whole family became hooked on it.  It's great to have such a wonderful series to share with them.  Here's a graded review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the booklet.1.  Pilot:  No living passengers.  No living crew.  A plane full of skeletal remains sparks an interagency investigation.  A2.  The Same Old Story:  A baby is born - and dies of old age half an hour later.  The bizarre event may be related to one of Olivia and John's unsolved cases.  A3.  The Ghost Network:  A troubled man foresees a bus crash that leaves its victims ""like mosquitoes trapped in amber.""  A4.  The Arrival:  An explosion destroys everything at a New York City construction site - everything except a mysterious cylinder made of solid iridium.  A5. Power Hungry:  A delivery guy is his own power grid, Olivia suffers an emotional shock and Walter takes on some birdbrained assistants.  B+6.  The Cure:  Diner patrons get a surprise when they interact with a disoriented woman; their brains boil inside their skull.  B+7.  In Which We Meet Mr. Jones:  Olivia flies to Frankfurt to confront a scientist who may be the creator of a giant, genetically altered parasite.  B8.  The Equation:  To find clues to the whereabouts of an abducted boy, Walter returns to St. Claire's... and may never get out again.  B+9.  The Dreamscape:  Brief encounters:  Olivia with John, Peter with a woman from his past and a Massive Dynamic analyst with killer butterflies.  A10.  Safe:  Three men rob a bank vault; two escape.  The third is left behind, embedded in the seemingly impenetrable vault wall.  B11.  Bound:  Olivia flees her captors only to confront an old foe - and parasitic slugs that kill their human hosts.  B-12.  The No-Brainer:  The team discovers a computer pop-up that liquefies human brains.  B13.  Transformation:  Victims of an airplane crash include a bizarre, spike covered creature with a glass disc implanted in his hand.  A+14.  Ability:  No eyes.  No mouth.  No nose.  Soon after Jones mysteriously escapes his prison cell, a normal man turns into a faceless corpse.  A+15.  Inner Child:  In a tunnel that's been sealed for 70 years, workers discover a feral boy who has a strange, intuitive connection to a killer.  A16.  Unleashed:  In a research lab, animal rights activists free chimps, dogs... and a bio-engineered beast that attacks Charlie.  A+17.  Bad Dreams:  Is Olivia part of the pattern?  Her terrifying dreams about suicide and murder mirror simultaneous, real-life events.  A+18.  Midnight:  On the hunt for a killer with a taste for spinal fluid, the team discovers that the shocking deaths may be related to ZFT terrorists.  A+19.  The Road Not Taken:  What appears to be spontaneous human combustion is investigated.  And Olivia learns more about the mysterious Cortexiphan drug trials.  A-20.  There's More Than One of Everything:  Walter's Gone Missing!  Meanwhile, Olivia tracks down the man who shot Nina Sharp and holds the key to finding the enigmatic William Bell.  A+I must admit that while I prefer X-Files overall, the myth arc here is constantly engaging as opposed to the mixed bag the conspiracy arc in X-Files has been for me.

First things first, the cover has a cool reflective casing, with two different images.  Nice touch considering the content of the show itself.  It has the usual flip type case for multiple discs that we've seen in sets like Die Hard and Blade Runner.  I actually prefer the flip cases to smaller individual cases. Also has multiple images on the CD's, the cover and the inside, nice touch. That's about it for cosmetics.There is over 7 hours of bonus features including the bd-live content.  BD-live is a very cool feature to have, even if you aren't utilizing it now, you might be in the near future and it includes a single insert with instructions on how to get started.Special features exclusive on blu-ray include Fringe Pattern Analysis:  Take a Closer Look at 6 select scenes with the experts.  These are actually really nice, as they focus on select scenes, instead of just some broad behind the scenes generalization that you usually get as an ""extra"".  And also additional writer/production commentary available through bd-live.Some other goodies:Featurettes on the show's creation, casting, the real science behind it and a great look at the special effects.There is the feature of Fringe:  Deciphering the Scene Sidebars on every episode, this is an interesting add-on.  I thought it was cool.Disected Files and Unaired scenes are here.  Alot of extras involved in indiviual episodes, which I thought was great and any fan of the show will like, as I'm sure we all have our favorites and our ""not-so-favorites.""I give this blu-ray set a enthusiastic thumbs up for all the extras.  It's appreciated.  I'm a fan of behind the scenes info and if you are as well, you'll enjoy this set.Now, for the look.  I have a blu-ray player (PS3) and an HDTV and all I can say, is beautiful.

The mass audience whose sole experience with Sci Fi is X-Files or BSG will like it. Needs more meat to keep a serious SciFi fan's attention.The acting is fine, the actors do a good job of making the characters fairly interesting, the writing is often banal and cliched unfortunately. Moves the obligatory government/big corporation conspiracy meta-plot along well and coherently unlike the X-Files, though the meta plot here is not nearly as interesting or intelligent as in the X-Files.Massive suspension of disbelief issues abound, the explanations for why the plots unfold as they do are usually dumb and unconvincing. We are led to believe that an extremist group is preparing for a war between alternate universes, but not enough convincing detail is given as to why the group acts as it does to allow immersion.

1174660,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B001C4CI8U,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[0, 1]","I recognize this feeling. I've been here before - with 'X-Files,' with 'Battlestar Galactica,' with 'Firefly.' A television series that sets up high expectations with a bold concept, lots of potential, and an original storytelling voice. A show that teases and tantalizes and excites the imagination. Something that makes me think ""This, now - this is something worth watching!""Make no mistake, the first season of 'Fringe' IS well worth watching. There is a lot of bang for your buck here. 20 full-length episodes on 7 discs, with lots of extras, including deleted scenes for most episodes and a fun gag reel.More importantly, 'Fringe' is excellent television, particularly if your tastes run to the edgier side of the spectrum. Starting off at a gallop, with an international flight that ends horrifically, the series poses idea after idea in the realm of 'fringe' science, where science meets the fantastic. Some of the ideas explored in the series include teleportation, time travel, telekinesis, mind control, pyrokinesis, and alternate dimensions. All are explored through investigations of strange events, seen through the eyes of FBI agent Olivia Dunham as she solves crimes associated with the events. Agent Dunham is joined by Peter Bishop and his father, whose most recent residence was an insane asylum. Dr. Walter Bishop has a unique understanding of and connection to these strange events, but his memory is spotty at best. Together they uncover the source of the events, and slowly, discern a pattern connecting them.For the most part, 'Fringe' is filled with solid talent. A product of J.J. Abrams' unique vision, who brought us 'Alias,' 'Lost,' and the recent reboot of 'Star Trek,' it shows all the originality and knack for drama he's shown us before. The writing is top-notch, and so far rides the fine line of keeping much in the dark, but answering enough questions to keep you interested. The acting is excellent overall. Though Anna Torv is an unfortunate weak spot - she overplays her role sometimes as the 'tough girl' - she does the job, and the others more than make up for it. A high point is John Noble's portrayal of Dr. Walter Bishop; he plays a pitch-perfect mad scientist with depth and sensitivity, lucid and clear in some moments, then suddenly offbeat and odd with no awkward transitions - you never feel like he's ""acting."" It's also simply delightful to see Blair Brown in a substantive role again, though her appearances as the enigmatic Nina Sharp are too few and far between for my taste. A nice surprise awaits near the end of the series as well, for those who watch for it.All told, it makes for a exciting, strange and engaging story, full of suspense and unexpected twists and turns, with tons of potential. I felt this way about 'X-Files' in the beginning, but unfortunately that collapsed under its own weight by the end. The first season of the new 'Battlestar Galactica' made me feel this way too, almost lost its way halfway in, but managed to follow through on most of its promises in the end.

1174668,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001C4CI8U,Robert Moore,"[1, 1]","After Joss Whedon's DOLLHOUSE, the most anticipate new series of the 2008-2009 television schedule was J. J. Abrams's FRINGE.  The quick review is that FRINGE has been a disappointment.  The news, however, is not all bad.  While it has some problems, some of them perhaps insoluble, it has gotten progressively more interesting as it has gone along.  At the end of the first 5 or 6 episodes, I found myself not really caring what happened next on the show.  But after the fall finale, I discovered that I did.  I'm not sure this will ever become a truly good series, but it is at least one that I plan on continuing to watch.The core problem with the show is that the two leads - Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson - are simply not very good.  I like Anna Torv, consider her very attractive, but she isn't an especially compelling actress and she lacks charisma.  If she were a sidekick instead of the lead, she would be fine.  Unfortunately, she is called upon to carry the show, to be FRINGE's Sidney Bristow, and she simply isn't.  Additionally, unlike many of the other Australian or British actors currently on American television, Torv frequently loses her American accent.  I never, ever found myself thinking while watching Anna Friel on PUSHING DAISIES that she was British or that Yvonne Strahovski on CHUCK was Australian.  Strahovski seems American; Torv always seems like an Australian trying to sound American.  Mind you, I like Anna Torv.  I find her to be a pleasant screen presence.  But she is asked to be a lot more than pleasant and she doesn't quite manage it.  With coaching the accent can improve, but I'm not sure she can grow into the role.  As a result, I fear she is a permanent limiting presence on the show.  This bothers me, because, as I said, I really do like her.  Similarly, Joshua Jackson is not terribly appealing as Peter Bishop.  It isn't helped that his brow seems to be knit together in a permanent scowl.  He isn't the ostensible lead on the show, however, so he doesn't hinder the show to the same degree as Torv.  However, he would seem to be positioned as a potential love interest for Torv and the two of them completely lack any interpersonal chemistry.Beyond Torv and Jackson, however, the news is largely good.  John Noble chews his way through scene after scene with tremendous aplomb as the show's mad (literally) scientist Dr. Walter Bishop.  A great deal of his character depends on how it is written, but Noble brings a great deal to his performance.  Many will remember him from the LORD OF THE RINGS films, but I think that after FRINGE most will remember him from.  Also superb on the show is Lance Reddick, who has a recurring role on LOST as well as on FRINGE.  He has an unforgettable presence, extremely tall, head shaven, very dark skinned, and haunting, huge eyes set in a face with somewhat sunken features.  If anything he has been under utilized so far on the show.  Hopefully that will change.So, there are some inherent cast problems that I think will continue to haunt the show and limit how good it can become.  Initially the show suffered from some uncharacteristically weak writing (uncharacteristic given the excellent writers on the show), but that has improved sharply in the last 3 or 4 episodes and the prospect seems very good for the rest of Season One to be very good.  Plus the show shows promise in other ways.  Every good show of this sort requires a good villain.  So far the villains have been at best weak.  We haven't yet been able to determine whether Blair Brown is friend or foe.  But in the two most recent episodes Jared Harris has appeared as David Robert Jones who has real potential as a villain.  The show also has a very intriguing character known simply as The Observer who is quite enjoyable.  He frequently shows up in episodes in the background of scenes, though he has also featured prominently in a couple of others.  I think he will become increasingly important as the show progresses.Do I recommend this show to others?  Absolutely.  It has a lot of potential and after a rough start has started to fulfill the good things people were hoping for it.  I think much the same thing might take place with DOLLHOUSE, even more eagerly anticipated than FRINGE.  Multiple sources have reported initial problems with the show that apparently are improving as it progresses.  Given that DOLLHOUSE has perhaps the most impressive collection of writers currently working on television it would be surprising if it did not improve.  Interestingly, FRINGE and DOLLHOUSE are the two shows that FOX has chosen to try out something new.  Calling it ""Hands Off Remote"" viewing, FRINGE has had far fewer commercials than other TV shows.  Most shows today have about 18 minutes of commercials per hour.  FRINGE has averaged about half that much.  So far I have to confess that I haven't acclimated myself to the smaller commercial times.  I of course never watch commercials, just as I'm sure most viewers do not.  I run to the restroom, run to the fridge, dash to my computer to his a couple of TV boards to see how others are responding, and so forth.  But I never, ever watch the commercials.  I suspect the only time that this is going to have a real impact on my viewing will be when I get (if I do, and right now I suspect that I will) FRINGE and DOLLHOUSE on DVD.  Then I'll greatly appreciate the few additional moments of story.",4,"After a shaky start, FRINGE looks like it has hit its stride",1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,5417,"['Joss', 'Whedon', 'DOLLHOUSE',

Abrams (""Alias"", ""Lost"", once upon a time known primarily as the creator of ""Felicity"", believe it or not) comes ""Fringe"", the latest in a long line of supernatural/science fiction procedural dramas (a number of which also aired on FOX).  ""Fringe""'s most obvious antecedents are ""The X-Files"" (an FBI team investigating mysterious happenings) and Abrams' own ""Alias"" (starting with its lead female characer, and the comparisons become more obvious as the show goes on).  This first season on DVD does not pop right out of the gate like ""Alias"" did, but it is nonetheless a strong start and gets better the further along it goes.  Spoilers follow.We open with Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv, the latest in a line of Abrams leading ladies), an FBI agent in Boston (bonus points for eschewing the standard New York/Los Angeles setting) who finds herself in the middle of a peculiar bioterrorism case when her partner/lover John Scott (Mark Valley, fairly consistently underused throughout his tenure on the show) is infected with a ghastly disease.  Olivia enlists the assistance of the eccentric Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble, in a series-stealing role), who has spent the last seventeen years in a mental institution.  Also along for the ride is Walter's estranged son Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Olivia's assistant Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole), supervised by Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick).  The Fringe unit becomes a permanent unit investigating The Pattern, a chain of strange occurences that may all lead back to Massive Dynamic, the science conglomerate founded by Walter's old lab partner, Dr. William Bell, and run by Nina Sharp (Blair Brown).""Fringe"", like ""The X-Files"" and ""Alias"", mixes procedural and myth arc elements; there are individual cases, which may or may not be linked to the overarching story of The Pattern.  The procedural parts of the series, particularly in the early episodes, can be a little hit-and-miss.  There's a fairly identifiable pattern to the early cases, much as with, say, ""House"", which after a while can feel a little repetitive.  However, the show is aided by some impressively gruesome effects, both makeup and CGI.  The series improves enormously the more it develops its larger plot and integrates it more fully into the individual cases, an indicator of the greatness to come in seasons two and three.  Anna Torv is a superb lead actress, with tremendously believable facial expressions.  She is matched by John Noble as Walter Bishop, who is simultaneously the main comic relief and the centre of the show's tragedy (though some of his early mannerisms can be a bit cutesy).  Joshua Jackson is suitably dashing as Peter, and has good chemistry with Torv, though at this juncture his character is still a little at a loss for a real role in the procedural aspects of the show.  The supporting cast is strong.All in all, the show is off to a good start with season one.",4,Season One is a good show with glimmers of greatness to come.,1310601600,"07 14, 2011",2011,2972,"['mind', 'TV', 'megaproducer-turned-film', 'director', 'J.', 'J.', 'Abrams', 'Alias', 'Lost', 'once', 'time', 'known', 'primarily', 'creator', 'Felicity', 'believe', 'not', 'Fringe', 'latest', 'long', 'line', 'supernatural/science', 'fiction', 'procedural', 'dramas', 'number', 'also', 'aired', 'FOX', 'Fringe', 'most', 'obvious', 'antecedents', 'are', 'X-Files', 'FBI', 'team', 'investigating', 'mysterious', 'happenings', 'Abrams', 'own', 'Alias', 'starting', 'lead', 'female', 'characer', 'comparisons', 'become', 'more', 'obvious', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'not', 'pop', 'right', 'gate', 'Alias', 'did', 'nonetheless', 'strong', 'start', 'better', 'further', 'Spoilers', 'follow.We', 'open', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'latest', 'line', 'Abrams', 'leading', 'ladies', 'FBI', 'agent', 'Boston', 'bonus', 'points', 'eschewing', 'standard', 'New', 'York/Los', 'Angeles', 'setting', 'who', 'middle', 'peculiar', 'bioterrorism', 'case', 'when', 'partner/lover', 'John', 'Scott', 'Mark', 'Valley', 'fairly', 'consistently', 'underused', 'tenure', 'show', 'infected', 'ghastly', 'disease', 'Olivia', 'assistance', 'eccentric', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'series-stealing', 'role', 'who', 'spent', 'last', 'seventeen', 'years', 'mental', 'institution', 'Also', 'along', 'ride', 'Walter', 'estranged', 'son', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'Olivia', 'assistant', 'Astrid', 'Farnsworth', 'Jasika', 'Nicole', 'supervised', 'Philip', 'Broyles', 'Lance', 'Reddick', 'Fringe', 'unit', 'permanent', 'unit', 'investigating', 'Pattern', 'chain', 'strange', 'occurences', 'may', 'lead', 'back', 'Massive', 'Dynamic', 'science', 'conglomerate', 'founded', 'Walter', 'old', 'lab', 'partner', 'Dr.', 'William', 'Bell', 'run', 'Nina', 'Sharp', 'Blair', 'Brown', 'Fringe', 'X-Files', 'Alias', 'mixes', 'procedural', 'myth', 'arc', 'elements', 'are', 'individual', 'cases', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'linked', 'overarching', 'story', 'Pattern', 'procedural', 'parts', 'series', 'particularly', 'early', 'episodes', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'hit-and-miss', 'fairly', 'identifiable', 'pattern', 'early', 'cases', 'much', 'say', 'House', 'while', 'can', 'feel', 'little', 'repetitive', 'However', 'show', 'aided', 'impressively', 'gruesome', 'effects', 'makeup', 'CGI', 'series', 'enormously', 'more', 'larger', 'plot', 'more', 'fully', 'individual', 'cases', 'indicator', 'greatness', 'come', 'seasons', 'two', 'three', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'superb', 'lead', 'actress', 'tremendously', 'believable', 'facial', 'expressions', 'matched', 'John', 'Noble', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'who', 'simultaneously', 'main', 'comic', 'relief', 'centre', 'show', 'tragedy', 'early', 'mannerisms', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'cutesy', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'suitably', 'dashing', 'Peter', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Torv', 'though', 'juncture', 'character', 'still', 'little', 'loss', 'real', 'role', 'procedural', 'aspects', 'show', 'supporting', 'cast', 'strong.All', 'show', 'good', 'start', 'season', 'one']",Fringe: Season 1

Olivia kind of metamorphoses into a heroine with superhero abilities.

JJ wanted to keep the show simple so new viewers could jump in, about halfway through the season that went out the window and the show really shined. The show really took it's time to get alot of pieces into place the first part of the season then in the second part of the season it used all those pieces to blow us away. If you enjoyed any of JJ's other programs, or if your a fan of great television dramas you will love Fringe I guarantee it. The actors and storyline are superb. The casting is excellent there is not a wasted character in this show, because the actors bring depth to even the small impact roles. The storyline and characters make this show a must have for any serious TV fan. No dvd or blu ray library is complete without it.The Blu Ray release is amazing.

The storyline is clever and compelling, with both stand-alone episodes and others that advance the longer story arc. You could conceivably skip episodes but I can't imagine why you'd want to.What really makes this series are the stellar performances, most notably by John Noble, an actor so fine I'm at a loss to praise him as much as he deserves. He is riveting - charming, crazy, childlike, sly, ferociously intelligent, off the wall, always surprising. A real joy to watch. Anna Torv is spot on as Olivia Dunham, reserved, smart, brave, wounded but carrying on in a quiet and affecting way. She never strikes a pose and that alone is a rarity. Compare her beautifully unflashy and genuine manner to the ludicrous carryings on of Joanne Kelly as Myka of Warehouse 13, who appears to think every scene is a fashion shoot. Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop is growing as an actor before our eyes, and growing into a part that slowly reveals the character to be much deeper than we initially were led to believe.Visually, the series is outstanding and, if the actors weren't so strong, they'd be hard put to compete with Walter's lab and the scene-stealing Jean the cow. The supporting cast is completely up to the mark. With such a strong start, and what is obviously a carefully thought out backstory with exceptional writing to support it, my only fear is that this series won't have a chance to play out to the end due to its unfortunate venue: Fox, the network that's notorious for killing all their most promising children before they can walk.

1174744,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B001C4CI8U,Terry Mesnard,"[1, 1]","J.J. Abrams is well known in TV land for crafting superb stories that involve action, dramatic plot twists and usually great characters.  Fringe is his latest contraption, a kind of mix of the strange cases of X-Files, Outer Limits and/or The Twilight Zone and recent procedural shows like CSI.  Straying from his last hit show, Lost, Abrams decided to take a more episodic route by crafting a story that has a strong meta-story but is also done in bite-sized pieces where, unlike his superior show Lost, a viewer could miss a handful of shows and still have a hold on the story.  Fringe started on somewhat shaky ground, with uneven episodes that struggled to find its niche.  Much like another sci-fi influenced show on Fox that was created by another famous TV creator (i.e. Dollhouse), Fringe doesn't really hit its stride until about halfway through the season.  But when it does, it definitely far outmatched Dollhouse and crafted a show that had me eager for season two to begin.The three main characters are at the heart of Fringe:  special agent Olivia Dunham, mad scientist and just plain kook Walter Bishop and Walter's son and professed ""jack of all trades,"" Peter Bishop.  In the pilot episode, these three characters are unceremoniously thrust together and form a shaky union.  Olivia needs Walter's immense knowledge of what's going on, but Walter resides in an asylum and seems to be barely functioning.  The only way he can be released is if it's into the care of a family member.  Enter Peter Bishop, who ends up being wrangled into this whole mess.  These characters have a lot of life and their personalities clash and complement each other in a humorous way.  Walter, in particular, offers much of Fringe's humor with his oftentimes strange demands, his eccentric and fast changes of thought and his outlook on life.Each episode, meanwhile, is laid out much like other procedural shows (albeit with a supernatural/sci-fi twist) where something happens that causes the Fringe Division, as it's called, to be called in as a cleanup crew and to figure out why and how it happened.  So, episodes will delve into rare diseases, chimeras, psychic abilities, spontaneous combustion, teleportation, rapid aging, etc.  Meanwhile, there is the aforementioned meta-story that begins to unfold, tying everything together as ""The Pattern.""  Unfortunately, for the first half of the season, the entire story is pretty stagnant and I was afraid Fringe would be more in line with the CSIs of the world and less with establishing a strong background mythos.  Luckily, Abrams cranked up the story a few notches and you start to realize that, while each episode stands on their own, they are also intricately connected to one another.As the first season hurtles toward its end, Abrams throws a couple Lost-style curveballs into the mix and the finale has more than a few revelations which really spice up the story and provide clues for what the next season has in store.  Ultimately, Fringe succeeded in hooking me and, with season two already airing, I've fallen for the show.  If you're at all interested, I'd definitely recommend giving season one a chance.  It's one of the better new shows and so far it seems to only be getting better.Oh and it looks great on Blu Ray.  Details are outstanding.  There's some grain but it's never distracting and a definite step up from the HD TV version.  From an aural perspective, it's decent; Warner Bros includes a good Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track but no TrueHD track.

I grew up watch classic Sci-Fi shows such as &#34;The Outer Limits&#34;, &#34;The Twilight Zone&#34;, and &#34;One-Step Beyond&#34;. As kids, our week wasn't complete until we had watched one of those with a bowl of home-popped popcorn. They were creative, intriguing, and to this day draw huge viewership.The problem I have with Today's Sci-Fi is that it lacks the respectful guardness against unnecessarily offending the religious and/or morally concerned viewers. As such, Abrams, Kurtzi, Orci will never achieve the venerable status of such men as Pat Densham, or Rod Serling. These men knew where to draw the line, and while certainly played up to it, never crossed over. The Abrams, Kurtzi, and Orcis of this generation despise lines of reverence, and do all that they can to violate them at every turn.As such, I can only give this series a 4 star rating at best.Good storyline, great casting, fantastic special effects.The psuedo-science mumbo-jumbo gets a bit annoying, but tolerable. But when it comes to the spiritual... it's pure POISON.If the Boston portrayed in Fringe in any way reflects the reality, I'm glad I do not live there. It's a &#34;police state&#34; of un-American scale, and I'm surprised any self-respecting &#34;Liberal&#34; American could live there.Do I recommend buying it? Yeah, if you really have that kind of money to burn.Do I recommend it for easily influenced children under the age of say 14? NO. There are far too many morally/ethically questionable scenes in it.

I rarely catch anything on primetime, so I'm a little behind on the curve in giving Fringe its proper kudos.  I approached it somewhat apprehensively, being a big LOST fan but wondering if JJ Abrams sophomore effort could even match his first.  Fringe seriously exceeded all expectations.I think characters are better written in todays television than they have been in decades, and Fringe is no exception.  John Noble's Dr Bishop is absolutely phenomenal, and an authentic charaterization of genius/insanity.  His comments and outbursts are equal parts funny/interesting/creepy.  His son, Peter (Josh Jackson) is the most likeable criminal you'll meet.  There's solid chemistry between he and Agent Dunham (Anna Torv, who is probably my least favorite of the main characters), and even Astrid The Lab Agent does what she needs to do to play a good supportive cast member.The plotlines are far-out but believable enough to be credible and unsettling.  Almost never does Fringe give you the feeling that we are dealing with science-fiction, but more with science-gone-wrong (plausible, considering today's high-profit pharmaceutical industry).  It has a strong linear episodic path, and really keeps pulling you along from the Pilot on.  Special effects work well, and while not cutting edge, do their part.If dramas like Lost and The X-Files have at least at some point captured your liking, you will become a fan of Fringe very quickly.

If you like conspiracy theories and suspect that the governments are not telling us everything that we should know then you will have a great time.Unfortunately, even the best shows do fail at certain time (even the incredible BSG faltered in its final episodes), so I can live with the complete lack of believability in some episodes. What I can not live with is the horrible acting and cliche attitudes of some of the key characters. Anna Torv is cold as ice. Yes, we know she is under duress and all that but can't anybody other than the Bishops show some emotion, please? She is so wooden, I am starting to doubt she is an android manufactured in the lab of Walter Bishop. And don't make me start on Broyles!

He adds emotion, intelligence and quirkiness which makes the show interesting. He is a great actor and it shines even through all the overshadowing blunderings.I think the show has potential if it can build on its strengths (I don't want to give away anything but if the character revealed at the season finale is here to stay then I am certainly on board for the next season) while eliminating its shortcomings.

1174758,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B001C4CI8U,Todd Smith,"[0, 0]","It's rare for me to give a television show a perfect rating, but I will say, without hesitation, that Fringe is the best original Science Fiction show to come along in thirty years. When J.J Abrams started working on his follow up to Lost, he wanted to create a show that touched on everything that had been done before it. Fringe takes elements of Star Trek, The X-Files, The Twilight Zone, and others, and incorporates them all into his story. It was a show that was truly ahead of it's time and initially had a lot of network support.The premier episode on FOX is the most expensive pilot episode ever made and the fans love it. The first two seasons of Fringe were highly rated, but not in the top ten. Not realizing what they had or the cult following it had behind it, FOX started moving the show around, eventually putting in on Friday nights, where it died after just 100 episodes. Today, the show is carried on in books and several of the cast have talked about the possibility of having it turned into a film franchise.The story of Fringe began in 2008, when an airplane with 250 passengers on board, landed itself in Boston, without any survivors. All the agencies show up, including the FBI, who send their liaison officer, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv). Dunham and her partner/lover are sent to do the dirty work, but stumble upon something unexpected, which puts them at the head of the investigation team. Not believing what she saw, Dunham goes in search of help, and finds a brilliant scientist, who used to do classified experiments for the U.S. Government. There is a problem of course, as the scientist, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble), has been in a mental institution for 17 years. In order to get him out, Dunham must track down and recruit the help of Bishop's son, Peter (Joshua Jackson), who is a con-man, working out of Iraq. With the team in place, they work to solve the impossible case and are asked by Col. Peter Broyles (Lance Reddick), to become part of a classified team of FBI members, who are assigned to work on the strange and unexplainable.From parallel universes to time travel to human experimentation and even monsters, Fringe really incorporated everything they could into the story, in one way or another. Anna Torv stars as Agent Olivia Dunham and what a star she is. How J.J. Abrams found her is nothing short of amazing in and of itself. Torv hadn't been in very many things, but had an impressive background, that includes her being a martial arts expert, who speaks multiple languages. They put her talents to use and make her the new head investigator of the Fringe division. Torv was the action star of the show, who turned out to be even more, when the cast met their duplicates from the alternate universe in season 3. I really can not express in words how terrific this woman was and how important her character was to every fascist of the story.As for the other main character of the story, that's Dr. Walter Bishop played by John Noble. Noble is one of those guys, you've seen in movies and on television all the time, but also the kind of guy whose name you probably didn't know. With Dr. Walter Bishop, John Noble established himself as a Sci-Fi legend. Much in the way his former partner William Bell, played by Leonard Nimoy, is associated with Spock, Noble and Bishop will be forever linked. Not only does his character bring a brilliant mind to the cast, but also brings humor to the show. After being locked in a mental hospital for 17 years, there isn't much Walter won't say or do. He loves to eat, do LSD, and tell people exactly what he thinks, leading to some of the best one-liners I have ever heard in a Science Fiction series.Fringe isn't all about the strange and unusual, it's also about family, action, love, and humor. I can tell you that it is the single most addictive show I've seen in my entire life. I wound up watching all 100 episodes in under 3 months, and now that it's over, I find myself missing it and thinking about it often. Even though I'm a Netflix member with a large collection, for almost 2 weeks now, I have been sampling other series, looking for something to fill the void. I'm finding myself having trouble even getting into similar shows, the way I got into Fringe. It is one of the best television shows I have ever seen. If you're into Science Fiction this show is an absolute must see. If you're not into Science Fiction, there is still a ton of stuff here for you as well. Do yourselves a favor and treat yourself to this remarkable show while it is still streaming on Netflix.",5,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",2014,4575,"['rare', 'give', 'television', 'show', 'perfect', 'rating', 'will', 'say', 'hesitation', 'Fringe', 'best', 'original', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'show', 'come', 'along', 'thirty', 'years', 'When', 'J.J', 'Abrams', 'started', 'working', 'follow', 'up', 'Lost', 'wanted', 'create', 'show', 'touched', 'everything', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'Fringe', 'elements', 'Star', 'Trek', 'X-Files', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'others', 'story', 'was', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'ahead', 'time', 'initially', 'had', 'lot', 'network', 'support.The', 'premier', 'episode', 'FOX', 'most', 'expensive', 'pilot', 'episode', 'ever', 'made', 'fans', 'love', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Fringe', 'were', 'highly', 'rated', 'not', 'top', 'ten', 'Not', 'realizing', 'what', 'had', 'cult', 'following', 'had', 'FOX', 'started', 'moving', 'show', 'around', 'eventually', 'putting', 'Friday', 'nights', 'where', 'died', 'just', '100', 'episodes', 'Today', 'show', 'carried', 'books', 'several', 'cast', 'have', 'talked', 'possibility', 'having', 'turned', 'film', 'franchise.The', 'story', 'Fringe', 'began', '2008', 'when', 'airplane', '250', 'passengers', 'board', 'landed', 'Boston', 'survivors', 'agencies', 'show', 'up', 'including', 'FBI', 'who', 'send', 'liaison', 'officer', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'Dunham', 'partner/lover', 'are', 'sent', 'do', 'dirty', 'work', 'stumble', 'something', 'unexpected', 'head', 'investigation', 'team', 'Not', 'believing', 'what', 'saw', 'Dunham', 'search', 'help', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'who', 'used', 'do', 'classified', 'experiments', 'U.S.', 'Government', 'problem', 'course', 'scientist', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'been', 'mental', 'institution', '17', 'years', 'order', 'get', 'out', 'Dunham', 'must', 'track', 'down', 'recruit', 'help', 'Bishop', 'son', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'who', 'con-man', 'working', 'Iraq', 'team', 'place', 'work', 'solve', 'impossible', 'case', 'are', 'asked', 'Col.', 'Peter', 'Broyles', 'Lance', 'Reddick', 'become', 'part', 'classified', 'team', 'FBI', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'assigned', 'work', 'strange', 'unexplainable.From', 'parallel', 'universes', 'time', 'travel', 'human', 'experimentation', 'even', 'monsters', 'Fringe', 'really', 'incorporated', 'everything', 'could', 'story', 'one', 'way', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'Agent', 'Olivia', 'Dunham', 'what', 'star', 'How', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'found', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'Torv', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'very', 'many', 'things', 'had', 'impressive', 'background', 'being', 'martial', 'arts', 'expert', 'who', 'multiple', 'languages', 'put', 'talents', 'use', 'make', 'new', 'head', 'investigator', 'Fringe', 'division', 'Torv', 'was', 'action', 'star', 'show', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'when', 'cast', 'met', 'duplicates', 'alternate', 'universe', 'season', '3', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'express', 'words', 'how', 'terrific', 'woman', 'was', 'how', 'important', 'character', 'was', 'fascist', 'story.As', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'played', 'John', 'Noble', 'Noble', 'one', 'guys', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'television', 'time', 'also', 'kind', 'guy', 'name', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'Dr.', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'established', 'Sci-Fi', 'legend', 'Much', 'way', 'former', 'partner', 'William', 'Bell', 'played', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'associated', 'Spock', 'Noble', 'Bishop', 'will', 'be', 'forever', 'linked', 'Not', 'only', 'character', 'bring', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'cast', 'also', 'humor', 'show', 'being', 'locked', 'mental', 'hospital', '17', 'years', ""n't"", 'much', 'Walter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'do', 'eat', 'do', 'LSD', 'tell', 'people', 'exactly', 'what', 'leading', 'best', 'one-liners', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'series.Fringe', ""n't"", 'strange', 'unusual', 'also', 'about', 'family', 'action', 'love', 'humor', 'can', 'tell', 'single', 'most', 'addictive', 'show', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'life', 'wound', 'up', 'watching', '100', 'episodes', '3', 'months', 'now', 'find', 'missing', 'thinking', 'often', 'Even', ""'m"", 'Netflix', 'member', 'large', 'collection', 'almost', '2', 'weeks', 'now', 'have', 'been', 'sampling', 'other', 'series', 'looking', 'something', 'fill', 'void', ""'m"", 'finding', 'having', 'trouble', 'even', 'getting', 'similar', 'shows', 'way', 'got', 'Fringe', 'one', 'best', 'television', 'shows', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', ""'re"", 'Science', 'Fiction', 'show', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', ""'re"", 'not', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'still', 'ton', 'stuff', 'here', 'as', 'well', 'Do', 'favor', 'treat', 'remarkable', 'show', 'still', 'streaming', 'Netflix']",Fringe: Season 1

However, it is not the content of the show that makes it.  It is the acting and the rich dialogue between characters that make me want to come back each time.  Certainly there are stereotypes: The mad scientist, the pretty but tough female cop, the good looking rogue with a heart of gold.  However, the characters come alive on the screen and are portrayed with such adept skill that they are a joy to watch.

Given that set-up, I was quite surprised then when I found myself bored out of my mind most of the time struggling to get through Season 1.  The main problem is the show is SLOW and plodding, hence it made me bored.  Also, most of the stories I found mediocre, some flat out bad, really bad.  The main character, Olivia Dunham, I found uninteresting (and) Peter, the supposed 190 IQ super genius I found grating and also a bore (and, oddly, he doesn't appear excessively smart most of the time).  Fortunately I did like the third wheel character, Dr. Walter Bishop, somewhat (he's quirky and has some good lines).  He was the only minor redeeming element of the show.  The acting is only okay, the actors forced to work with mediocre scripts, so not entirely the actors faults that their acting isn't great.  Writing obviously sub-par.  Camera work bad.  Editing bad.  SFX okay-ish.  Music forgettable.  So, overall a major disappointment.  I waited a long time to buy this on DVD and get into it, thinking I would eagerly watch seasons 1-3 over the course of a few weeks and relish them like I did watching much of the ""Lost"" series on DVD.

True, I only tuned in cause of JJ Abram's involvement, and me being a complete LOST freak, I figured, why not? I am so glad I did take the time to watch Fringe because I just loved the first season. It is very sci-fi and creative and has one of the best characters on TV- Walter, played to perfection by John Noble. He's not even the main character but he steals every scene he is in. He plays dad to Joshua Jackson's character and it's really nice to see him on screen again. Anna Torv plays Olivia, and she is technically the star of this, though she is also the show's weakest link. Her acting is not great, though she does improve towards the end.There is a barrage of minor characters, some important, some not, and sometimes, it can be a bit tricky keeping track of all those people. There is a good mixture of drama and suspense and of course those comedic moments that come out of nowhere. Almost every episode starts the same way-with some freakish incident involving a person or place. And, well, it really is more fun to watch than to explain it. To be honest though, it was all getting a tad repetetive towards the end there, but then the season finale happened and things just clicked and you almost get a jaw-dropping experience.

1174777,A25W5SLUOZ53GZ,B001C4CI8U,"Wayne B. Norris ""Power User""","[0, 0]","For starters, you can compare this with Grimm [whose characters are much more appealing and whose international  conspiracy theory is much more refreshing] or, historically, with X Files [whose writing was very snappy] or even with Twin Peaks [which was so over-the-top as to make you hang onto every word].In that world, Fringe is, well, &#34;just OK&#34;.  Despite the zany adventures of the heroine, her character is hard to get into, and I'd guess at least 20% of her screen time is spent looking pensively at someone else who is speaking.  The is-he-or-isn't-he-dead boyfriend seems to serve little purpose at this point.  The FBI sidekick is underutilized and eminently colorless.  The stone-faced boss jumps from friendly and supportive to being a real dick with no apparent plot reason.  The loopy scientist dad is gratuitously weird, not appealingly weird.  The son is a crazy foil character, a blend between a Greek chorus and a supporting character like Pancho from the Cisco Kid.A lot of the plots border on the idiotic.  Now, understand that this is spoken in the context of Grimm, X FIles, and Twin Peaks.  So I do not mean &#34;loopy&#34; or &#34;zany&#34; or &#34;fantastical&#34;.  I actually mean &#34;idiotic&#34;, and that is not a compliment.  The reasons are myriad and small, but the writing could be VASTLY improved.Nobody expects the science in this to be spot-on [like the Big Bang Theory] or even cohesive [like the X Files].  But, really, folks, the &#34;science&#34; in this is right out of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.  Compared with a lot of recent offerings [even CSI, for heaven's sake], it's unadulterated crap.  The intro says it all... &#34;Dark Matter&#34; &#34;Psychokinesis&#34; &#34;Teleportation&#34; &#34;Artificial Intelligence&#34; &#34;Nanotechnology&#34;.  That's a bit like saying &#34;The Hillside Strangler&#34; &#34;The Green River Killer&#34; &#34;The Big Bad Wolf&#34; &#34;Donald  Duck&#34;.  believe it or not, there actually ARE viewers who know babies don't come from under green leaves and that airplanes don't fly on the wings of fairies.  Again, I am not comparing this to a recent issue of Journal of the American Chemical Society - just to a recent episode of CSI Miami or House.  The science is so bad, I find it distracting to watch.  And the interplay between the scientist and his son simply rubs it in - like nettles on a sunburn.I hope it improves as we move past Episode 9 of the First season..  My sister's husband was the DOP on several episodes in Years 3 and 4.  I'd not gotten time to watch till now, but I hope they threw him some good material.

An outbreak of a virus that causes the flesh to melt off of bone on an airplane begins the journey for Agent Dunham (Anna Torv), scientist Walter Bishop (John Noble)and his estranged son Peter (Joshua Jackson)to discover who is behind these attacks and why.J.J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci throw in a bit of ""The X-Files"" and ""LOST"" into the mix for their latest creation. Luckily you won't have to invest 5 years as Abrams his crew wrap up a lot of the questions for the show in the first season. The writing and direction are for the most part top notch with production values and visual effects to match. After a couple of so-so episodes during the first half of the season where the producers were clearly searching for the best way to develop the characters, the show picked up steam and became a juggarnaut with a number of outstanding episodes that rank with the best ""The X-Files"" ever did.Update: A Warning about the Blu-ray: The Blu-ray isn't very well authored with the episodes ""playing all"" without having a choice as to which episode you want to play on start up. There was a similar issue with a season of ""Supernatural"" as well.The Blu-ray looks marvelous aside from this criticism.The DVD looks quite good although there are quite a few compression artifacts probably related to having so many episodes and extras on each disc. I didn't get a copy of the Blu-ray but if I do i'll do a comparison.Extras are quite good including a commentary from J.J. Abrams on the pilot episode with the second best commentary by Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman (""Beautiful Minds"") who wrote or co-wrote two pivotal episodes and directed one of them. We also get mini-features on most of the episodes ""Decipering the Scene"", ""Dissected Scenes"" (deleted scenes for many episodes), a very good multi-part documentary on the series as well as a featurette on the casting of the series (John Noble nailed his role from the moment he did his first audition). We also get ""Unusual Side Effects"" a very long gag reel and a featurette on the visual effects (there are spoilers with a lot of the extras so you may want to watch them AFTER you've seen the entire series). ""The Real Science of 'Fringe'"" focuses on how the writers come up with ideas while speaking with the science advisors on the show. The ""real"" science is mostly far out fantasy extrapolated on a simple idea. Finally we get a montage for everyone's favorite character Gene the cow. Hey, there have to be some ""fringe"" benefits from having to give milk and be on set all day.This is an exceptional first season and ""Fringe"" rapidly finds its groove although a couple of episodes are weak, the show is, for the most part, on target most of the time. The extras are really good and picture quality is good as well. If you can spring for the Blu-ray, I'd probably go that way simply because the show is shot in high def and with all the extras/episodes included the image quality should be signficantly better.",4,"The ""Pattern"" emerges during the first season and fans will get lots of ""Fringe"" benefits in the form of extras...",1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,3071,"['Pattern', 'begun', 'series', 'bizarre', 'seemingly', 'random', 'bioterror', 'attacks', 'begin', 'happening', 'outbreak', 'virus', 'flesh', 'melt', 'bone', 'airplane', 'journey', 'Agent', 'Dunham', 'Anna', 'Torv', 'scientist', 'Walter', 'Bishop', 'John', 'Noble', 'estranged', 'son', 'Peter', 'Joshua', 'Jackson', 'discover', 'who', 'attacks', 'why.J.J', 'Abrams', 'Alex', 'Kurtzman', 'Roberto', 'Orci', 'throw', 'bit', 'X-Files', 'LOST', 'mix', 'latest', 'creation', 'Luckily', 'wo', ""n't"", 'have', 'invest', '5', 'years', 'Abrams', 'crew', 'up', 'lot', 'questions', 'show', 'first', 'season', 'writing', 'direction', 'are', 'most', 'part', 'top', 'notch', 'production', 'values', 'visual', 'effects', 'match', 'couple', 'so-so', 'episodes', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'where', 'producers', 'were', 'clearly', 'searching', 'best', 'way', 'develop', 'characters', 'show', 'picked', 'up', 'steam', 'became', 'juggarnaut', 'number', 'outstanding', 'episodes', 'rank', 'best', 'X-Files', 'ever', 'did.Update', 'Warning', 'Blu-ray', 'Blu-ray', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'authored', 'episodes', 'playing', 'having', 'choice', 'episode', 'want', 'play', 'start', 'up', 'was', 'similar', 'issue', 'season', 'Supernatural', 'well.The', 'Blu-ray', 'marvelous', 'aside', 'criticism.The', 'DVD', 'quite', 'good', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'compression', 'artifacts', 'probably', 'related', 'having', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', 'extras', 'disc', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'copy', 'Blu-ray', 'do', 'i', ""'ll"", 'do', 'comparison.Extras', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'including', 'commentary', 'J.J.', 'Abrams', 'pilot', 'episode', 'second', 'best', 'commentary', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'Beautiful', 'Minds', 'who', 'wrote', 'co-wrote', 'two', 'pivotal', 'episodes', 'directed', 'one', 'also', 'get', 'mini-features', 'most', 'episodes', 'Decipering', 'Scene', 'Dissected', 'Scenes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'many', 'episodes', 'very', 'good', 'multi-part', 'documentary', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'featurette', 'casting', 'series', 'John', 'Noble', 'nailed', 'role', 'moment', 'did', 'first', 'audition', 'also', 'get', 'Unusual', 'Side', 'Effects', 'very', 'long', 'gag', 'reel', 'featurette', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'spoilers', 'lot', 'extras', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'AFTER', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'Real', 'Science', ""'Fringe"", 'focuses', 'how', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'ideas', 'speaking', 'science', 'advisors', 'show', 'real', 'science', 'mostly', 'far', 'out', 'fantasy', 'extrapolated', 'simple', 'idea', 'Finally', 'get', 'montage', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'character', 'Gene', 'cow', 'Hey', 'have', 'be', 'fringe', 'benefits', 'having', 'give', 'milk', 'be', 'set', 'day.This', 'exceptional', 'first', 'season', 'Fringe', 'rapidly', 'groove', 'couple', 'episodes', 'are', 'weak', 'show', 'most', 'part', 'target', 'most', 'time', 'extras', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'spring', 'Blu-ray', ""'d"", 'probably', 'go', 'way', 'simply', 'show', 'shot', 'high', 'def', 'extras/episodes', 'included', 'image', 'quality', 'should', 'be', 'signficantly', 'better']",Fringe: Season 1

1174787,AP3B615GM191G,B001C4CI8U,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","In the fall of 2008, I tuned into this show because of brilliant director J.J. Abrams (creator of LOST, my all-time favorite TV drama). I watched roughly two thirds of the first season (until about February) and decided to exclude it from my weekly TV ""regimen"". Though some episodes were very interesting and entertaining, most others felt like fillers that weren't really leading anywhere. Plus, even the ""cannon"" material didn't really get off the ground. It was kind of like watching The X-Files without any mythology...it would be decent, but nowhere near special.However, as a recent Christmas gift, I was given the entire first season on DVD and prodded to begin where I had left off with the promise that the show would begin to blow my mind. I reluctantly agreed, as once I cast away a show I usually don't return, and picked up on the 14th (of 20) episode entitled ""Ability"". Within a few days, I was quickly finished with this season and scrambling to catch up on Season Two before it returns to the air!Basically, the show is about the aptly-named ""Fringe"" division of the F.B.I., including three main participants:Walter Bishop, a once-deranged scientist, now somewhat (!) sane, who conducted crazy physics experiments in his younger years that come into play nearly every week.Peter Bishop, son of Walter, who seems to just blend into the background at times but may, as Season Two rolls along, just turn out to be the most fascinating character of the whole show.Olivia Dunham, lead FBI investigator, who not only does the field work but also is tied to the Bishops due to strange happenings in her childhood.This Fringe division investigates an abundance of strange/paranormal events that comes to be known as ""The Pattern"", which (in the early goings) all seems to point to the uber-company Massive Dynamic (led by the shadowy Nina Sharp). The goal is to determine why these freakish events keep occurring and discover their source.As I mentioned earlier, the first two thirds of this plotline never really get off the ground. Peter is more annoying than anything, Walter is just a nut, and Sharp's Massive Dynamics isn't developed enough to really hook you in. Plus, Dunham is more preoccupied with communicating with her murdered FBI partner John Scott than with anything that the Bishops have to offer. However, once the Scott storyline is put to rest and the ZFT/William Bell angle is picked up on in ""Ability"", that is when the show goes from borderline to incredible. The characters become much more human, the plot will have you hanging at every turn, and the sheer brilliance of the writing will astound you.Think of it this way...it is like a combination of the X-Files mythology (although even more interesting and better thought-out), the heavy physics concepts from Season Five of LOST, and even the Stephen King ""there are other worlds than these"" concept that spawned the incredibly popular ""Dark Tower"" books.Thus, I urge you to PLEASE not give up on this show until you have watched the entire thing. It starts slow and looks to be wallowing around for awhile, but (I guess) never should we doubt the mind of Mr. Abrams. The final scene of the season?

The fringe division takes on the cases of the paranormal, similar to the ""X-Files"" Oliva's supervisor ""Agent Broyles"" allows her to work with Dr. Walter Bishop and his son Peter Bishop. Walter, who was institutionalized, is a very smart man, but needs his sons help, in order to complety function.Fringe does start out a little slow, but it ends with a bang !Writer/Producer/Creator of ""Fringe"" JJ Abrams does a wonderful job of makeing the plot very interesting, and confusing.
