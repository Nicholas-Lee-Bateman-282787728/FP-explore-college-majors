Those who have read the original ""Scandal in Bohemia"" which introduces Sherlock's one lost love, will take umbrage with her depiction as a cold blooded killer. That is totally out of character.Also, in an attempt to appeal to younger viewers, there were several obvious (and somewhat lame) anachronisms such as a reference to a ""search engine"" (I'm surprised they didn't use the word Google), and the kids letting loose with ""awesome"" and ""Duh"".  The use of roller skates, however, was actually fairly accurate, time-wise (I had to research it to see if it, too, was an anachronism but it wasn't!)Finally, the focus was on the ""Irregulars"" instead of Holmes and Watson which, for me, wasn't as interesting.Yet, all in all, it was STILL enjoyable! The sets were extremely well done and the acting was above average. And it was, after all, a Sherlock Holmes movie!

1078566,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000R349HK,C. O. DeRiemer,"[0, 1]","Watson writes, ""To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.""Holmes met Irene Adler in answer to a plea from Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia. The heir presumptive, about to marry a proper member of the nobility, had engaged in a passionate affair with Adler, known to society as an adventuress. A photograph of the two in Irene Adler's possession would compromise the nuptials if she uses it maliciously or for gain. Holmes calls upon every bit of his skill plus a cunning disguise to learn where she keeps the photo. When he returns to claim it, however, he discovers she is gone, leaving him a letter...and the photograph. It seems that while she might have been an adventuress, she also was a woman of honor, humor and wit. She was one of the very few people, and the only woman, to outsmart Sherlock Holmes. He asked to keep the photograph as the only payment he desired from Wilhelm.But the writers of this erratic television program have turned Irene Adler into a cold-blooded killer. Shame on them.The case starts when one of the Baker Street Irregulars, a group of ragamuffin street urchins who occasionally assist Holmes, goes missing. Sherlock Holmes (Jonathan Pryce) says he will help find the boy, but first he becomes involved in a separate case involving murdered policemen, poison gas and jade pipes. The Irregulars won't wait...and soon they discover clues that may tie the two problems together. By this time, however, Holmes has been accused of murdering the two inspectors out of jealousy. Now under house arrest, he must depend on the Irregulars to do his legwork. This will involve theft, breaking and entering, burglary and a general application of initiative. Along the way they will encounter an embalmed corpse and a heartless woman. Yes, Irene Adler. (This is no spoiler. The writers are so inept there is no mystery as to the ""who,"" only what the ""who"" is up to.). Only after a perilous search in the moldering dockside warehouses of London and a splashing run through the London sewers is Irene Adler caught. Her arrest required the selfless courage of each of the Irregulars and the sharp cunning of Sherlock Holmes.If only this program had been better. It's by no means a flop, just too placid. More to the point, the writers were either too careless or didn't care enough to respect the era in which the story is placed. All too often one member or the other of the Irregulars will say something that is far too contemporary. The result is a jarring reminder for us not to relax. The story also has a vital plot development that depends on the most improbable bit of makeup lazy writing could come up with. The acting is as variable as the script. There are one or two nice jobs from the kids playing the irregulars, but most of the time we're just watching adequate child actors, and who don't look grubby, just made-up to look grubby. Pryce creates a curious Sherlock Holmes. He's an extraordinary actor, but here he makes Holmes almost grandfatherly. I suppose that if we accept that the story really is about the adventures of the Irregulars and not so much about Holmes, we'd be happier.Some fine actors play the major adult roles. To see Pryce at his amazing best, just watch him as Lytton Strachey inCarrington. Bill Paterson plays a congenial Watson. He's a fine, intelligent character actor and was excellent as Jack Lithgow inTraffik - Miniseries. Anna Chancellor is Irene Adler. Unfortunately, she's excellent at turning the charming memory of the original Irene into a ruthless (and beautiful) monster. She made a notable Miss Bingley in 1995'sPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996). Michael Maloney is Inspector Stirling, a man who detests Holmes at the top of his voice. Even Maloney can't do much with the role. He can play some most agreeable characters. Try him as Jasper Pye inLove on a Branch Lineand as Joe Harper inA Midwinter's Tale.Sherlock Holmes and the Baker Street Irregulars might be adequate family fare as long as the family doesn't know much about Holmes and even less about Irene Adler. I think it's best to let Holmes keep the memory of the original Irene in his heart. Old men need their memories. This Irene he'd gladly send to the gallows, and probably will.The BBC television program runs a little less than two hours. It looks just fine. The only significant extra is a printed list of credits for each of the four main actors.",3,At least we and Holmes will always have our memories of the real Irene Adler,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,4605,"['Watson', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'always', 'woman', 'have', 'seldom', 'heard', 'mention', 'other', 'name', 'eyes', 'whole', 'sex', 'Holmes', 'met', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'answer', 'plea', 'Wilhelm', 'Gottsreich', 'Sigismond', 'von', 'Ormstein', 'Grand', 'Duke', 'Cassel-Felstein', 'hereditary', 'King', 'Bohemia', 'heir', 'presumptive', 'marry', 'proper', 'member', 'nobility', 'had', 'engaged', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Adler', 'known', 'society', 'adventuress', 'photograph', 'two', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'possession', 'would', 'compromise', 'nuptials', 'maliciously', 'gain', 'Holmes', 'bit', 'skill', 'cunning', 'disguise', 'learn', 'where', 'photo', 'When', 'claim', 'however', 'gone', 'leaving', 'letter', 'photograph', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'adventuress', 'also', 'was', 'woman', 'honor', 'humor', 'wit', 'was', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'only', 'woman', 'outsmart', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'asked', 'keep', 'photograph', 'only', 'payment', 'desired', 'Wilhelm.But', 'writers', 'erratic', 'television', 'program', 'have', 'turned', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'cold-blooded', 'killer', 'Shame', 'them.The', 'case', 'when', 'one', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Irregulars', 'group', 'ragamuffin', 'street', 'urchins', 'who', 'occasionally', 'assist', 'Holmes', 'missing', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'will', 'help', 'find', 'boy', 'first', 'involved', 'separate', 'case', 'involving', 'murdered', 'policemen', 'poison', 'gas', 'jade', 'pipes', 'Irregulars', 'wo', ""n't"", 'wait', 'soon', 'discover', 'clues', 'may', 'tie', 'two', 'problems', 'together', 'time', 'however', 'Holmes', 'been', 'accused', 'murdering', 'two', 'inspectors', 'jealousy', 'Now', 'house', 'arrest', 'must', 'depend', 'Irregulars', 'do', 'legwork', 'will', 'involve', 'theft', 'breaking', 'entering', 'burglary', 'general', 'application', 'initiative', 'way', 'will', 'encounter', 'embalmed', 'corpse', 'heartless', 'woman', 'Yes', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'spoiler', 'writers', 'are', 'so', 'inept', 'mystery', 'who', 'only', 'what', 'who', 'up', 'to.', 'Only', 'perilous', 'search', 'moldering', 'dockside', 'warehouses', 'London', 'splashing', 'run', 'London', 'sewers', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'caught', 'arrest', 'required', 'selfless', 'courage', 'Irregulars', 'sharp', 'cunning', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes.If', 'only', 'program', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'flop', 'just', 'too', 'placid', 'More', 'point', 'writers', 'were', 'either', 'too', 'careless', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'enough', 'respect', 'era', 'story', 'placed', 'too', 'often', 'one', 'member', 'other', 'Irregulars', 'will', 'say', 'something', 'far', 'too', 'contemporary', 'result', 'jarring', 'reminder', 'not', 'relax', 'story', 'also', 'vital', 'plot', 'development', 'most', 'improbable', 'bit', 'makeup', 'lazy', 'writing', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'acting', 'as', 'variable', 'script', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'nice', 'jobs', 'kids', 'playing', 'irregulars', 'most', 'time', ""'re"", 'just', 'watching', 'adequate', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'grubby', 'just', 'made-up', 'look', 'grubby', 'Pryce', 'curious', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'extraordinary', 'actor', 'here', 'almost', 'grandfatherly', 'suppose', 'accept', 'story', 'really', 'adventures', 'Irregulars', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Holmes', ""'d"", 'be', 'happier.Some', 'fine', 'actors', 'play', 'major', 'adult', 'roles', 'see', 'Pryce', 'amazing', 'best', 'just', 'watch', 'Lytton', 'Strachey', 'inCarrington', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'congenial', 'Watson', 'fine', 'intelligent', 'character', 'actor', 'was', 'excellent', 'Jack', 'Lithgow', 'inTraffik', 'Miniseries', 'Anna', 'Chancellor', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'Unfortunately', 'excellent', 'turning', 'charming', 'memory', 'original', 'Irene', 'ruthless', 'beautiful', 'monster', 'made', 'notable', 'Miss', 'Bingley', ""1995'sPride"", 'Prejudice', 'Special', 'Edition', 'A', 'E', '1996', 'Michael', 'Maloney', 'Inspector', 'Stirling', 'man', 'who', 'Holmes', 'top', 'voice', 'Even', 'Maloney', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'role', 'can', 'play', 'most', 'agreeable', 'characters', 'Try', 'Jasper', 'Pye', 'inLove', 'Branch', 'Lineand', 'Joe', 'Harper', 'Midwinter', 'Tale.Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Irregulars', 'might', 'be', 'adequate', 'family', 'fare', 'as', 'long', 'family', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Holmes', 'even', 'less', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'think', 'best', 'let', 'Holmes', 'keep', 'memory', 'original', 'Irene', 'heart', 'Old', 'men', 'need', 'memories', 'Irene', ""'d"", 'gladly', 'send', 'gallows', 'probably', 'will.The', 'BBC', 'television', 'program', 'little', 'less', 'two', 'hours', 'just', 'fine', 'only', 'significant', 'extra', 'printed', 'list', 'credits', 'four', 'main', 'actors']",SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS

1078572,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B000R349HK,Kendra,"[22, 29]","In deference to Never the Twain:  Very mild plot spoiler in this review-- definitely doesn't affect overall plot.I am always on the lookout for a new Sherlock Holmes movie.  I couldn't wait until this came out, because it looked good and it was produced by the BBC-- which also produced the wonderful and never-to-be-duplicated Jeremy Brett series.What a disappointment this was!First of all, the villain here is Irene Adler. Why on earth was Irene Adler made the villain?  Adler was the only woman Holmes ever really respected and thought he could care about. And, in the Scandal in Bohemia, she clearly isn't a villain. She wrote Holmes a wonderful and caring letter and both Holmes and Watson were left with deep reverence (or at least respect) for her.  She is ""The Woman"" in Sherlock Holmes' life and was never, ever villainous at all.So, why did the BBC or the scriptwriter or WHOMEVER make Irene Adler one of the most evil and diabolical villains to ever exist?  This really is an outrage, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan.  There is nothing in any past Holmes story to indicate that Irene Adler would ever turn into a murderous, conniving, vindictive evil villain.  At the end of ""Scandal in Bohemia"", we are all convinced she is a good, honest, savvy person who earned the respect of Holmes.  This was such a disappointment that, had the rest of the movie been actually good, it still would have ruined it for me.Why not make Moriarty the villain? It is clear from some comments Watson makes that Moriarty is still alive. There is no reason to impugn Irene Adler's legacy by making her this type of villain.Secondly, the casting was not very good. Jonathan Pryce is a good actor, but there was nothing about him that made him Sherlock Holmes. He definitely didn't 'own' the character.  Of course, once you are hooked on Jeremy Brett, nobody can ever really be good enough.  But, still, Pryce was 'just a detective'-- there was nothing about his acting that made you believe he was Sherlock.  He wasn't brilliant. He wasn't extraordinary. There was nothing at all about him that was special.  And, the character (as created in this film) made one or two comments about others' lack of intelligence.  Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes would never do this.The actor playing Watson, on the other hand, was fine.  A little bit jolly, but definitely not insultingly doltish as portrayed in other films. Mrs. Hudson was sadly missed here.Third, I think this is a television pilot.  I'm not sure, but it seemed so. This entire movie seemed to be a setup for a future family-friendly series about the Baker Street Irregulars.  Holmes talks to them about how they should be taking care of themselves for when he isn't around anymore and there are a couple of plot lines that are clearly left open for a future story.  If this is a planned television series, the casting department certainly needs to recast some of the Irregulars' parts.  Most were decent, but there was one shorter boy that wasn't very good and Sadie, the lead Irregular, was horrible. She was so horrible that it was hard to have any empathy at all for her character.All in all, I really wouldn't recommend this.  It's definitely not for the Holmes purist, and I doubt it's for too many others, either. Even with the pre-teen and teen protagonists, I can't imagine too many parents anxious to push this as the first Holmes introduction to their children.  The embalming might make some parents decide against this. Personally, I would let my preteen and teen watch this if it was good, but I don't think there would be any benefit to do so. It's just not worth recommending at all.Instead of buying this, get absolutely anything with Jeremy Brett. And, if you've watched all of those, try the Murder Rooms.  Those are excellent.Edited to add: One reviewer here, referring to my review, believed that my review was a spoiler because I mentioned Irene Adler.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Irene Adler is mentioned as the villain in other reviews elsewhere and we find that out early on (and expect it the second Watson lets us know that Irene Adler is filed under ""evil villains"" in their filing system). The mystery is actually catching Irene and trying to figure out how she's doing what she's doing-- and why.",1,Irene Adler?,1189987200,"09 17, 2007",2007,4284,"['deference', 'Never', 'Twain', 'Very', 'mild', 'plot', 'spoiler', 'review', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'affect', 'overall', 'plot.I', 'am', 'always', 'lookout', 'new', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'came', 'out', 'looked', 'good', 'was', 'produced', 'BBC', 'also', 'produced', 'wonderful', 'never-to-be-duplicated', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'series.What', 'disappointment', 'was', 'First', 'all', 'villain', 'here', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'Why', 'earth', 'was', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'made', 'villain', 'Adler', 'was', 'only', 'woman', 'Holmes', 'ever', 'really', 'respected', 'thought', 'could', 'care', 'Scandal', 'Bohemia', 'clearly', ""n't"", 'villain', 'wrote', 'Holmes', 'wonderful', 'caring', 'letter', 'Holmes', 'Watson', 'were', 'left', 'deep', 'reverence', 'least', 'respect', 'Woman', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'life', 'was', 'never', 'ever', 'villainous', 'all.So', 'why', 'did', 'BBC', 'scriptwriter', 'WHOMEVER', 'make', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'diabolical', 'villains', 'ever', 'exist', 'really', 'outrage', 'are', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'fan', 'nothing', 'past', 'Holmes', 'story', 'indicate', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'would', 'ever', 'turn', 'murderous', 'conniving', 'vindictive', 'evil', 'villain', 'end', 'Scandal', 'Bohemia', 'are', 'convinced', 'good', 'honest', 'savvy', 'person', 'who', 'earned', 'respect', 'Holmes', 'was', 'such', 'disappointment', 'had', 'rest', 'movie', 'been', 'actually', 'good', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'me.Why', 'not', 'make', 'Moriarty', 'villain', 'clear', 'comments', 'Watson', 'Moriarty', 'still', 'alive', 'reason', 'impugn', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'legacy', 'making', 'type', 'villain.Secondly', 'casting', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'nothing', 'made', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", ""'own"", 'character', 'course', 'once', 'are', 'hooked', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'nobody', 'can', 'ever', 'really', 'be', 'good', 'enough', 'still', 'Pryce', 'was', ""'just"", 'detective', 'was', 'nothing', 'acting', 'made', 'believe', 'was', 'Sherlock', 'was', ""n't"", 'brilliant', 'was', ""n't"", 'extraordinary', 'was', 'nothing', 'was', 'special', 'character', 'created', 'film', 'made', 'one', 'two', 'comments', 'others', 'lack', 'intelligence', 'Arthur', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'Holmes', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'this.The', 'actor', 'playing', 'Watson', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'fine', 'little', 'bit', 'jolly', 'definitely', 'not', 'insultingly', 'doltish', 'portrayed', 'other', 'films', 'Mrs.', 'Hudson', 'was', 'sadly', 'missed', 'here.Third', 'think', 'television', 'pilot', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'seemed', 'so', 'entire', 'movie', 'seemed', 'be', 'setup', 'future', 'family-friendly', 'series', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Irregulars', 'Holmes', 'talks', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'care', 'when', ""n't"", 'around', 'anymore', 'are', 'couple', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'clearly', 'left', 'open', 'future', 'story', 'planned', 'television', 'series', 'casting', 'department', 'certainly', 'recast', 'Irregulars', 'parts', 'Most', 'were', 'decent', 'there', 'was', 'one', 'shorter', 'boy', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'Sadie', 'lead', 'Irregular', 'was', 'horrible', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'was', 'hard', 'have', 'empathy', 'character.All', 'really', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'definitely', 'not', 'Holmes', 'purist', 'doubt', 'too', 'many', 'others', 'either', 'Even', 'pre-teen', 'teen', 'protagonists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'too', 'many', 'parents', 'anxious', 'push', 'first', 'Holmes', 'introduction', 'children', 'embalming', 'might', 'make', 'parents', 'decide', 'Personally', 'would', 'let', 'preteen', 'teen', 'watch', 'was', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'benefit', 'do', 'so', 'just', 'not', 'worth', 'recommending', 'all.Instead', 'buying', 'get', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'try', 'Murder', 'Rooms', 'are', 'excellent.Edited', 'add', 'One', 'reviewer', 'here', 'referring', 'review', 'believed', 'review', 'was', 'spoiler', 'mentioned', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'Nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'mentioned', 'villain', 'other', 'reviews', 'elsewhere', 'find', 'out', 'early', 'expect', 'second', 'Watson', 'know', 'Irene', 'Adler', 'filed', 'evil', 'villains', 'filing', 'system', 'mystery', 'actually', 'catching', 'Irene', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'doing', 'what', 'doing', 'why']",SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS
1078573,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B000R349HK,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[1, 1]","To the long and already rambling list of attempts to juice up Sherlock Holmes for mass media audiences, we add this well-meaning but misguided whirlwind.  In what appears to be a pilot that never went to series, Holmes' preteen street squad takes center stage in an attempt to fight through the wall of crime that is Victorian London.  This one is blessed with an excellent Holmes in Jonathan Pryce, but is marred by an inability to decide what story it wants to tell.Some other reviewers have disparaged the way in which this telemovie retcons the role of Irene Adler.  I'm not sure the target audience of young viewers would much care.  I suspect that they would be more interested in the fact that the child characters' hand-wringing is particularly unappealing.  If the kids were to pull their thumbs out, the whole story would be over in thirty minutes.This story has its redeeming moments, particularly when the emphasis shifts to the grown-ups.

As mentioned in other reviews, the villainess shares the name of a beloved character from the Sherlock stories, but none of her marvelous traits. Furthermore, Jonathan Pryce, while a fine actor, seems very out of character for Sherlock, seeming much too like a sweet older gentleman than the proud, somewhat aloof Holmes.The action focuses on the Irregulars and the story seems to try to pander to a young audience with this crew. Unfortunately, for the first half of the story, I found it difficult to have much interest in them. By the second half, as I accepted the movie for what it was, I did find some humor and charm in it.As mentioned by others, there are some really good lines. There's also some really intriguing camera work that reminded me of some of the more experimental moments in the Granada series (like in the Devil's Foot, for instance) and a good soundtrack.When I was able to pretend it wasn't supposed to be a Sherlock Holmes story, I enjoyed it as much as I'd enjoy most movies geared towards a tween audience.

1078575,A3DSVRA71ENCS,B000R349HK,Never the Twain,"[29, 30]","Watching Jonathan Pryce in his first scene as Sherlock Holmes, I couldn't help but be reminded of watching Christopher Eccleston as the lead in another icon of British fiction Doctor Who. Like Eccleston as the good Doctor, Pryce comes across as simultaneously off-putting and appealing. In that respect, he is quite simply an ideal Sherlock Holmes. You sense the the sharp mind that makes him the best detective ever and also that other-ness which means he will never come off as being quite normal.Though much of the action is given over to the Baker Street Irregulars, Pryce's Holmes remains the focus of this story because it's the Irregulars efforts to clear his name when he's arrested for murder that drive the story. Even when Holmes is under house-arrest in his rooms at 221-B Baker Street, you can sense the wheels turning in his mind as he directs his foot-soldiers in order to solve a mystery with a deeply personal dimension for Holmes. Without spoiling anything, it's a twist that will probably be most appreciated by those with some background in the Holmes stories but such background is not essential.Above all, though, this is meant to be a fun story, an enjoyable mystery/adventure story with enough danger to keep things interesting without getting too dark. This latter point is probably a function of having been produced for a family viewing slot in Britain. The whole cast  does a good job, and it's especially nice to see one of Britain's best character actors Bill Patterson paired with Pryce in the equally iconic role of Doctor Watson.I won't say this is the best Sherlock Holmes story I've ever seen or heard (personally I'm a fan of John Gielgud's run as Holmes on the radio from the 1950s), but Pryce is certainly one of the best Sherlock Holmes. I truly hope that this production is the first of many for him.",4,Jonathan Pryce hits the mark as Sherlock Holmes,1185494400,"07 27, 2007",2007,1840,"['Watching', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'first', 'scene', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'reminded', 'watching', 'Christopher', 'Eccleston', 'lead', 'icon', 'British', 'fiction', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'Eccleston', 'good', 'Doctor', 'Pryce', 'simultaneously', 'off-putting', 'appealing', 'respect', 'quite', 'simply', 'ideal', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'sense', 'sharp', 'mind', 'best', 'detective', 'ever', 'also', 'other-ness', 'will', 'never', 'come', 'off', 'being', 'quite', 'normal.Though', 'much', 'action', 'given', 'Baker', 'Street', 'Irregulars', 'Pryce', 'Holmes', 'focus', 'story', 'Irregulars', 'efforts', 'clear', 'name', 'when', 'arrested', 'murder', 'drive', 'story', 'Even', 'when', 'Holmes', 'house-arrest', 'rooms', '221-B', 'Baker', 'Street', 'can', 'sense', 'wheels', 'turning', 'mind', 'foot-soldiers', 'order', 'solve', 'mystery', 'deeply', 'personal', 'dimension', 'Holmes', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'twist', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'most', 'appreciated', 'background', 'Holmes', 'stories', 'such', 'background', 'not', 'essential.Above', 'though', 'meant', 'be', 'fun', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'mystery/adventure', 'story', 'enough', 'danger', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'getting', 'too', 'dark', 'latter', 'point', 'probably', 'function', 'having', 'been', 'produced', 'family', 'viewing', 'slot', 'Britain', 'whole', 'cast', 'good', 'job', 'especially', 'nice', 'see', 'one', 'Britain', 'best', 'character', 'actors', 'Bill', 'Patterson', 'paired', 'Pryce', 'equally', 'iconic', 'role', 'Doctor', 'Watson.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'best', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'story', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'heard', 'personally', ""'m"", 'fan', 'John', 'Gielgud', 'run', 'Holmes', 'radio', '1950s', 'Pryce', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'truly', 'hope', 'production', 'first', 'many']",SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS

1078577,A1Z0CR9O2SLSH0,B000R349HK,Starfire,"[4, 5]","There are a number of things in this movie for the Holmes purist to pick apart, the identity of the villain being just one, but in the name of being fair, there are some good points as well.I was happy to see someone taking on the tough job of writing an new Holmes story that did not lift whole sections from the Doyle originals. Really, after you've watched the Six Napoleons with Jeremy Brett, do you really want to watch the same story with someone else as Holmes? So, even though the plot has some gaping holes in it, you have to give the writers a nod of thanks. New Sherlock Holmes projects have been few and far between lately.The plot does take liberties with the original canon; since another reviewer has already spilled the beans there - with no spoiler alert, I might add, I'll move on. By the very nature of the story, Holmes is unable to do much in his own defense and Watson too is shoved off to the side to make way for the Irregulars. This definitely makes it a young adult/teen adventure movie and it does frustrate me when the Great Detective sits in Baker Street motionless while all this goes on. I liked the concept of Holmes being the prime suspect but it also puts the number one character on the shelf.Jonathan Pryce is all right as Holmes but, no disrespect intended, I wish he were a bit younger for this role. He does capture Holmes' impatience with the slower intellects around him and he has several great lines - especially the one about 'celebrity being the last refuge of the imbecile.' That alone is worthy of the Holmes we know and love. His relationship with the Irregulars is up and down; sometimes they give him no slack - or trust - which is somewhat surprising, given what they do for him in the Doyle stories. Sometimes Holmes is extraordinarily patient with them, especially the abrasive Sadie, who is an actively annoying character. Watson is well played by Bill Paterson, a loyal, jolly soul who is not above smiling smugly as Holmes jabs at Scotland Yard. Watson is not buffoon in this one and that's all to the good.The Irregulars are a mixed bag; there are a couple of promising young actors, particularly Finch, and a couple who are really not very good at all. Some Americanisms creep into their speech and the net result is they really don't seem like the 'street arabs' Conan Doyle described but more like modern teens out on a lark.Bottom line; if you're looking for another Holmes movie to be just as good as the Jeremy Brett series, this isn't it. There is a lot to find fault on and pick apart. But if you'd like some new Sherlock Holmes video to watch and you can be flexible enough to stand some revisions to the Canon, you might want to give this one a try.",4,A uneven Holmes movie,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",2007,2716,"['are', 'number', 'things', 'movie', 'Holmes', 'purist', 'pick', 'apart', 'identity', 'villain', 'being', 'just', 'one', 'name', 'being', 'fair', 'are', 'good', 'points', 'well.I', 'was', 'happy', 'see', 'someone', 'taking', 'tough', 'job', 'writing', 'new', 'Holmes', 'story', 'did', 'not', 'lift', 'whole', 'sections', 'Doyle', 'originals', 'Really', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Six', 'Napoleons', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'do', 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'same', 'story', 'someone', 'else', 'Holmes', 'So', 'even', 'plot', 'gaping', 'holes', 'have', 'give', 'writers', 'nod', 'thanks', 'New', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'projects', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'far', 'lately.The', 'plot', 'take', 'liberties', 'original', 'canon', 'reviewer', 'already', 'spilled', 'beans', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'might', 'add', ""'ll"", 'move', 'very', 'nature', 'story', 'Holmes', 'unable', 'do', 'much', 'own', 'defense', 'Watson', 'too', 'shoved', 'off', 'side', 'make', 'way', 'Irregulars', 'definitely', 'young', 'adult/teen', 'adventure', 'movie', 'frustrate', 'when', 'Great', 'Detective', 'sits', 'Baker', 'Street', 'motionless', 'liked', 'concept', 'Holmes', 'being', 'prime', 'suspect', 'also', 'number', 'one', 'character', 'shelf.Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'all', 'right', 'Holmes', 'disrespect', 'intended', 'wish', 'were', 'bit', 'younger', 'role', 'capture', 'Holmes', 'impatience', 'slower', 'intellects', 'several', 'great', 'lines', 'especially', 'one', ""'celebrity"", 'being', 'last', 'refuge', 'imbecile', 'alone', 'worthy', 'Holmes', 'know', 'love', 'relationship', 'Irregulars', 'up', 'down', 'sometimes', 'give', 'slack', 'trust', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'given', 'what', 'do', 'Doyle', 'stories', 'Sometimes', 'Holmes', 'extraordinarily', 'patient', 'especially', 'abrasive', 'Sadie', 'who', 'actively', 'annoying', 'character', 'Watson', 'well', 'played', 'Bill', 'Paterson', 'loyal', 'jolly', 'soul', 'who', 'not', 'smiling', 'smugly', 'Holmes', 'jabs', 'Scotland', 'Yard', 'Watson', 'not', 'buffoon', 'one', 'good.The', 'Irregulars', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'are', 'couple', 'promising', 'young', 'actors', 'particularly', 'Finch', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'Americanisms', 'creep', 'speech', 'net', 'result', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', ""'street"", 'arabs', 'Conan', 'Doyle', 'described', 'more', 'modern', 'teens', 'out', 'lark.Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'looking', 'Holmes', 'movie', 'be', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'Jeremy', 'Brett', 'series', ""n't"", 'lot', 'find', 'fault', 'pick', 'apart', ""'d"", 'like', 'new', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'video', 'watch', 'can', 'be', 'flexible', 'enough', 'stand', 'revisions', 'Canon', 'might', 'want', 'give', 'one', 'try']",SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE BAKER STREET IRREGULARS
