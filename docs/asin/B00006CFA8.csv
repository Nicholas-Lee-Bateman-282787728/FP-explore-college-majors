Once you've seen it a couple of times, you've seen it. I don't think it's meditative, more like decorative.

The graphics were nice, music was nice (if you like Eastern music), but the continuous and constant display of symbols and writing on the screen through out every song got on my nerves!  I could undestand a display of symbols every now and then, and on certain songs, but the display of symbols and writing continued through out the entire DVD.  It didn't make any sense at all !!!  And, unless you understand the language, which I assume it was middle eastern or Indian, I have no clue as to what is being stated!  [...]  If I am going to read something that is being forced on me,  at least let me understand what it is !!  I didnt buy this DVD to read slogans, and I dont recomend it for purchase, unless you are from the middle east, and like to read a constant display of writings.",1,I don't recomend this DVD.,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",2004,867,"['6', 'Computer', 'Animated', 'DVDs', 'purchased', 'recently', 'was', 'worst', 'Why', 'graphics', 'were', 'nice', 'music', 'was', 'nice', 'like', 'Eastern', 'music', 'continuous', 'constant', 'display', 'symbols', 'writing', 'screen', 'song', 'got', 'nerves', 'could', 'undestand', 'display', 'symbols', 'now', 'then', 'certain', 'songs', 'display', 'symbols', 'writing', 'continued', 'entire', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'understand', 'language', 'assume', 'was', 'middle', 'eastern', 'Indian', 'have', 'clue', 'what', 'being', 'stated', '[', ']', 'am', 'going', 'read', 'something', 'being', 'forced', 'least', 'let', 'understand', 'what', 'didnt', 'buy', 'DVD', 'read', 'slogans', 'dont', 'recomend', 'purchase', 'are', 'middle', 'east', 'read', 'constant', 'display', 'writings']",N/A

711687,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B00006CFA8,Jon Norris,"[41, 43]","This DVD sets a high standard for animation or meditation related works. The production values are very good, the menu system works well, and the content is excellent. While the animations are primarily digitally enhanced and morphed video image collages as opposed to full 3D rendered stories, the style and quality of execution are superb.There are two main themes presented; one primarily of enhanced images, while the other is more like exotic title sequences for films. Some are blends of both. The video images are colored and modified, overlayed with nice animations of glowing lights, geometric patterns, particle fountains, and gorgeously morphed into other images. All kinds of title effects are used with exotic lettering that may or may not be real language. (It's beautiful, who cares?) There is also a menu of looping cuts out of the different pieces.I was also impressed with the music. It is a nice world music - new age kind of blend, and it fits the video quite well. Traditional instruments and beautiful voicework mix well with some electronic influences. I use it for meditation, and have ordered the CD to save wear and tear on the DVD.All in all, it lives up to the name, and the concept of video Illuminated Manuscripts shines through admirably. It is a relaxing and satisfying bit of eye candy and more. Having worked with video and computer graphics for nearly 20 years, I can say that few works reach this level. This DVD stands toe to toe with anything Hollywood (or New Zealand) can produce.I recommend this DVD to anyone who likes beautiful visual images, meditational music and images, or high quailty graphic arts. Definitely worth the money.

711688,A5C9651MPOLK2,B00006CFA8,Random Reviewer,"[20, 29]","This is definitely different than other straightforward computer animations videos such as the Mind's Eye series, and some people will probably really like it but it's not quite for me.It uses what look like real images such as waterfalls, etc, and then layers computerized textures on them and around them, bending the images, etc.Unfortunately, everytime it gets good, a bunch of cryptic symbols begin popping up everywhere.  I'm not sure if they actually mean anything or not, but they make the whole thing seem pretentious and repetitive.  And some of the segments begin by displaying their titles on the screen, which unnecessarily fragments the disc, so this is even worse if you're a DJ planning on showing this as continuous wallpaper in a club.  And everything happens very slow.But if you're just getting it for relaxation it might be good, especially the loops.  It would be nice if this type of animation were used for a future disc, without all the symbols and unnecessary titling.",3,Different than other computer animations discs,1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,994,"['definitely', 'different', 'other', 'straightforward', 'computer', 'animations', 'videos', 'such', 'Mind', 'Eye', 'series', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'really', 'not', 'quite', 'me.It', 'what', 'look', 'real', 'images', 'such', 'waterfalls', 'etc', 'then', 'layers', 'computerized', 'textures', 'bending', 'images', 'etc.Unfortunately', 'good', 'bunch', 'cryptic', 'symbols', 'begin', 'popping', 'up', 'everywhere', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'actually', 'mean', 'anything', 'not', 'make', 'whole', 'thing', 'seem', 'pretentious', 'repetitive', 'segments', 'begin', 'displaying', 'titles', 'screen', 'unnecessarily', 'disc', 'even', 'worse', ""'re"", 'DJ', 'planning', 'showing', 'continuous', 'wallpaper', 'club', 'everything', 'happens', 'very', 'slow.But', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'relaxation', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'especially', 'loops', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'type', 'animation', 'were', 'used', 'future', 'disc', 'symbols', 'unnecessary', 'titling']",N/A
711689,A2C5VCR3DYDPR2,B00006CFA8,Some Guy,"[4, 8]","Here is another example of where 90's-era digital animation ends up being mundane.  Even with the decade or so that has passed since the brief explosion of digital animation releases, I still enjoy watching the good ones (Gate to the Mind's Eye, Televoid).  This one doesn't count.The effort that went into this work was obviously tremendous, so you can't fault the quality.  It's also fairly unique in mixing animation with real imagery shot on location.But it's just so dull.  I suppose if you've had a really bad day and wanted to watch (and hear) something soothing, this would be a good choice.  I, although I certainly have my share of hectic days, want my animation to be gripping, weird, and fun.
