1570737,A3CZ6OEF26RRX5,B008N1FBIY,Bob North,"[1, 1]","Kukla, Fran and Ollie... 1949. I was five years old. My family was among the early TV users. The machines were big and heavy. The screen was the size of a coffee saucer. The adults who populated my life were talk'n Kuke & Ollie. Their talk was over my head... as was much of the program. I love these discs. I have a large high tech TV and the old show looks... good. The sound is good the image is good. The people are talented, intelligent, and very warm and loving. Here is the BIGGEST THING: Kukla, Fran and Ollie is a reminder of just how much slower life was in those years. Slow is good... no, slow is FANTASTIC. There is literature that comes with the discs that suggests we ""get used"" to the program, by viewing only one a day. Right, do not try accomplish the project in just a few sittings. Let the experience happen at the original pace. It is worth savoring.You WILL enjoy the RCA VICTOR commercials. You will appreciate the ""distortion free"" 45 RPM record player that plugs into your radio... cost: $12.95. You may appreciate the ""Americaness"" of RCA VICTOR and the show. You may feel good about our country for loving Kuke & Ollie. My daughter is 33 years old. I was her extremely serious father in the 80s. Every day... for years, I left notes on the entry stairway for her. I wanted her to ALWAYS know I was thinking of her, loving her. My notes always had my drawing of Kukla with a balloon for my text. My drawing had every important detail, from the sharp eyebrows to the little round mouth. I had not seen Kuke since the early fifties, yet the warmth of the character stayed in my brain until I wanted to put affection on daily notes... slow, easy, daily. So, I have told my daughter about the recordings. She is looking forward to seeing some with me. She spoke with such love for her Kuke experience.Oliver J. Dragon, by the way is the most fun-loving witty, and funny character. He is a lesson in simple joy.This is beautiful, loving art. You will love Fran, and all of the ""players."" You will love the music. You may very well be able to absorb the goodness. If you are old enough to have the personal memory... the word is: the disks themselves are prepared with Kuklapolitan sincerity.",5,Good old days... were pretty good,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,2212,"['Kukla', 'Fran', 'Ollie', '1949', 'was', 'five', 'years', 'old', 'family', 'was', 'early', 'TV', 'users', 'machines', 'were', 'big', 'heavy', 'screen', 'was', 'size', 'coffee', 'saucer', 'adults', 'who', 'populated', 'life', 'were', 'talk', 'n', 'Kuke', 'Ollie', 'talk', 'was', 'head', 'was', 'much', 'program', 'love', 'discs', 'have', 'large', 'high', 'tech', 'TV', 'old', 'show', 'good', 'sound', 'good', 'image', 'good', 'people', 'are', 'talented', 'intelligent', 'very', 'warm', 'loving', 'Here', 'BIGGEST', 'THING', 'Kukla', 'Fran', 'Ollie', 'reminder', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'slower', 'life', 'was', 'years', 'Slow', 'good', 'slow', 'FANTASTIC', 'literature', 'discs', 'get', 'used', 'program', 'viewing', 'only', 'one', 'day', 'Right', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'accomplish', 'project', 'just', 'few', 'sittings', 'Let', 'experience', 'happen', 'original', 'pace', 'worth', 'savoring.You', 'WILL', 'enjoy', 'RCA', 'VICTOR', 'commercials', 'will', 'appreciate', 'distortion', 'free', '45', 'RPM', 'record', 'player', 'radio', 'cost', '12.95', 'may', 'appreciate', 'Americaness', 'RCA', 'VICTOR', 'show', 'may', 'feel', 'good', 'country', 'loving', 'Kuke', 'Ollie', 'daughter', '33', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'extremely', 'serious', 'father', '80s', 'day', 'years', 'left', 'notes', 'entry', 'stairway', 'wanted', 'ALWAYS', 'know', 'was', 'thinking', 'loving', 'notes', 'always', 'had', 'drawing', 'Kukla', 'balloon', 'text', 'drawing', 'had', 'important', 'detail', 'sharp', 'eyebrows', 'little', 'round', 'mouth', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'Kuke', 'early', 'fifties', 'yet', 'warmth', 'character', 'stayed', 'brain', 'wanted', 'put', 'affection', 'daily', 'notes', 'slow', 'easy', 'daily', 'So', 'have', 'told', 'daughter', 'recordings', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'spoke', 'such', 'love', 'Kuke', 'experience.Oliver', 'J.', 'Dragon', 'way', 'most', 'fun-loving', 'witty', 'funny', 'character', 'lesson', 'simple', 'joy.This', 'beautiful', 'loving', 'art', 'will', 'love', 'Fran', 'players', 'will', 'love', 'music', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'able', 'absorb', 'goodness', 'are', 'old', 'enough', 'have', 'personal', 'memory', 'word', 'disks', 'are', 'prepared', 'Kuklapolitan', 'sincerity']",N/A

But once I'd watched it, I became addicted to it. It was like no other show of the time, and certainly not the rest of children's programming then -The Howdy Doody Show, Hopalong Cassidy reruns, Captain Video. The only kids' show anything like it was the new show, Time for Beany, which was scripted (and acted?) by the great comic scriptwriter Stan Freberg and seemed at times -it, too, was a puppet show, with Cecil the Sea Serpent its ""Ollie""--a more heavily scripted, less adlibbed, and thus less freer, version of my beloved KF&O.;I'm not going to devote time to listing the characters on KF&O.; In addition to round headed and red-nosed Kukla and single-toothed Ollie the Dragon and lovable Fran Allyson, who happened to be real where Kukla and Ollie and all the other characters were hand puppets, and thus, I guess, not real, my favorites were probably Beulah the Witch, who looked a bit like Joan Baez on steroids, and Cecil Bill, who, in lieu of speaking words, said nothing but ""Ptooey ptooey ptooey,"" but with great range of feeling. Behind it all, of course, was master puppeteer Burr Tillstrom, who must have been a genius!What made the show work was the depth of the relationship between Fran, sane, warm and accepting, and her more volatile friends, and Kukla and Ollie. Kukla was reasonable and Ollie vain, even occasionally bombastic. They came across as though real live young boys and Fran as their accepting but also skeptical older sister. And so much of the show was improvised. There was an air of immediacy to what happened each afternoon on air. Whimsey is a word that is often misused but whimsical is an excellent description of the mood created on this outstanding show. It could be so funny at times but you always felt there was genuine warmth between the characters. It was the antithesis of the glib, superficial comedies that dominate so much of this days' adult television world.

1570740,A3JJ6LZZ7RFFCU,B008N1FBIY,Jeff B. Sultanof,"[3, 3]","For years, the legendary Kukla, Fran and Ollie TV program was praised as one of the great programs in television history. Of course, for years these shows were unavailable and given how the networks destroyed many of their programs, the thought of seeing episodes was pretty depressing. It would have been tempting to consider this as just another puppet show, and there were many of those during the early years of television (think Howdy Doody and Judy Splinters).These kinescopes come from Tillstrom's personal collection. While it is true that some work went into making these films look and sound good, they were in pretty good shape to begin with, not the case with many kinescopes. Apparently these two volumes are drawn from about 700 episodes which exist, and they are marvelous.The telecast history of this program reflects the changes in television programming even in this early period of television. The format of the first few years of the show was 30 minutes five days a week. By 1951, NBC was already messing with the program, cutting it down to 15 minutes. It was restored to 30 minutes, but now only aired mid-day on Sundays (and it is implied that Tillstrom and company were lucky to get that spot). This new format actually works in the program's favor; it now boasts a studio audience and a 12 piece orchestra with strings. These episodes are my favorites, as sophisticated and entertaining as the best variety shows of the era. Children's show, my eye!!KFO was not a show for children, although they would certainly enjoy it. Tillstrom aimed it at adults, and since this is timeless humor, these programs are as fresh as when they were first seen. It is clear to me that Jim Henson watched this program, as he also aimed his creations and his humor at adults, but with child appeal (I wonder whether it was a coincidence when Ms. Piggy said the word ""Moi?"" Beulah the witch says it as well here). Tillstrom was indeed a major influence on other entertainers who used puppets, and in Fran Allison, he had a wonderful singer who also worked well with the characters, as if they were real.This show is indeed a classic, and at these prices, you owe yourself a gift you will enjoy watching many times and sharing with others. It is also pretty neat to see the commercials for RCA Victor's new 45 players, something very new in 1949.Two volumes with two discs in each is not enough!!!
