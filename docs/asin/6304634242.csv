430224,AJI8AE4LR8P5A,6304634242,Brian Niven,"[1, 3]",A Perfect Candidate is an interesting and thought provoking documentary on the Senate race between Republican Oliver North (of Iran Contra fame) and scandal tarred incumbent Deomcrat Chuck Robb.The movie tries to make the case that no matter what your positions are on the issues it is better to vote for someone who is a idealogue than a moderate. It demeans the very notion of someone who may be conservative on some issues and liberal on others. Before that it is a celebration of Oliver North because of his perfect conservatism. When North starts to make mistakes and Robb starts tearing into him the movie becomes more interesting because the filmmakers obviously never thought Robb could win re-election.The great thing about this documentary is all of the scenes with Douglas Wilder. He was the first black governor of Virginia and ran as an independant in the Senate race for a while. The racial issues explored is the main reason why this is worth getting.,3,Good but troubling POV,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,966,"['Perfect', 'Candidate', 'interesting', 'thought', 'provoking', 'documentary', 'Senate', 'race', 'Republican', 'Oliver', 'North', 'Iran', 'Contra', 'fame', 'scandal', 'tarred', 'incumbent', 'Deomcrat', 'Chuck', 'Robb.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'make', 'case', 'matter', 'what', 'positions', 'are', 'issues', 'better', 'vote', 'someone', 'who', 'idealogue', 'moderate', 'very', 'notion', 'someone', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'conservative', 'issues', 'liberal', 'others', 'celebration', 'Oliver', 'North', 'perfect', 'conservatism', 'When', 'North', 'starts', 'make', 'mistakes', 'Robb', 'tearing', 'movie', 'more', 'interesting', 'filmmakers', 'obviously', 'never', 'thought', 'Robb', 'could', 'win', 're-election.The', 'great', 'thing', 'documentary', 'scenes', 'Douglas', 'Wilder', 'was', 'first', 'black', 'governor', 'Virginia', 'ran', 'independant', 'Senate', 'race', 'while', 'racial', 'issues', 'explored', 'main', 'reason', 'why', 'worth', 'getting']",Perfect Candidate VHS

From beginning to end, North's campaign seems to embody all the dark and hypocritical realities that American citizens suspect, but don't generally believe, our elected officials embrace in running for office. North's ruthlessness in plotting to use sexual rumors against his opponent, Senator Chuck Robb, contrasts sharply Robb's naive but honest political hayseed public persona. North is willing to stoop and crow, which may sadden those who always saw him as the fall-guy in the Iran-Contra scandal. Taylor and Cutler juxtapose North's Congressional testimony, admitting that he lied to Congress, to his ""on the campaign trail"" act, proselytizing to high school students about honesty.  North comes off even worse than his right-wing counterparts, for while they enjoy abusing their naive opponent, they seem to know that their mean-spiritedness is a tactic, whereas North seems to enjoy the prospect of punishing Robb more than the idea of being elected.North's campaign advisors make just as interesting a spectacle as North himself. They are, without exception, hard-working, extremely successful people. They make their living by being the sort of people who get called to either back up, or respond to, threats, attacks, complaints, schemes, and calamities. Their bravado thickens the air of the chaos that bleeds through the entire documentary.The most revealing moment of the entire documentary is when, upon writing North's concession speech, his campaign advisor pauses in a rare moment of reflection and remarks that, while running for office is about building walls up between people, governing is about tearing them down and coming together. We soften towards him in the end, as his eyes well up upon hearing North deliver the speech, part of it being lifted from a poem inscribed on a coffee mug belonging to his grandmother.Only upon reflection during the rare calm moments can the audience occasionally sense his disquiet. In high school civics I read that extremism in defense of liberty is no sin, but I now wonder if schmoozing, snarling, misleading, browbeating and back-scratching are.A Perfect Candidate gives the audience a glimpse into the heart of American electoral politics.",5,A Very Good Look at American King-making,1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,2406,"['once', 'embodied', 'one', 'most', 'flagrant', 'abuses', 'power', 'ever', 'exercised', 'out', 'touch', 'president', '1994', 'Oliver', 'North', 'took', 'campaign', 'trail', 'bid', 'U.S.', 'Senate', 'seat', 'Virginia', 'beginning', 'end', 'North', 'campaign', 'embody', 'dark', 'hypocritical', 'realities', 'American', 'citizens', 'suspect', 'do', ""n't"", 'generally', 'believe', 'elected', 'officials', 'embrace', 'running', 'office', 'North', 'ruthlessness', 'plotting', 'use', 'sexual', 'rumors', 'opponent', 'Senator', 'Chuck', 'Robb', 'sharply', 'Robb', 'naive', 'honest', 'political', 'hayseed', 'public', 'persona', 'North', 'willing', 'stoop', 'crow', 'may', 'sadden', 'who', 'always', 'saw', 'fall-guy', 'Iran-Contra', 'scandal', 'Taylor', 'Cutler', 'juxtapose', 'North', 'Congressional', 'testimony', 'admitting', 'lied', 'Congress', 'campaign', 'trail', 'act', 'proselytizing', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'honesty', 'North', 'off', 'even', 'worse', 'right-wing', 'counterparts', 'enjoy', 'abusing', 'naive', 'opponent', 'seem', 'know', 'mean-spiritedness', 'tactic', 'whereas', 'North', 'enjoy', 'prospect', 'punishing', 'Robb', 'more', 'idea', 'being', 'elected.North', 'campaign', 'advisors', 'make', 'just', 'interesting', 'spectacle', 'North', 'are', 'exception', 'hard-working', 'extremely', 'successful', 'people', 'make', 'living', 'being', 'sort', 'people', 'who', 'get', 'called', 'back', 'up', 'respond', 'threats', 'attacks', 'complaints', 'schemes', 'calamities', 'bravado', 'air', 'chaos', 'entire', 'documentary.The', 'most', 'revealing', 'moment', 'entire', 'documentary', 'when', 'writing', 'North', 'concession', 'speech', 'campaign', 'advisor', 'rare', 'moment', 'reflection', 'remarks', 'running', 'office', 'building', 'walls', 'up', 'people', 'governing', 'tearing', 'down', 'coming', 'together', 'soften', 'towards', 'end', 'eyes', 'well', 'hearing', 'North', 'deliver', 'speech', 'part', 'being', 'lifted', 'poem', 'inscribed', 'coffee', 'mug', 'belonging', 'grandmother.Only', 'upon', 'reflection', 'rare', 'calm', 'moments', 'can', 'audience', 'occasionally', 'sense', 'disquiet', 'high', 'school', 'civics', 'read', 'extremism', 'defense', 'liberty', 'sin', 'now', 'wonder', 'schmoozing', 'snarling', 'misleading', 'browbeating', 'back-scratching', 'are.A', 'Perfect', 'Candidate', 'audience', 'glimpse', 'heart', 'American', 'electoral', 'politics']",Perfect Candidate VHS

However, I recommend that you view this film more than once, because by the end of the film, it can be argued that the filmmakers put the Democratic candidate, a very wishy-washy Chuck Robb, in a poor light.  The scene where he was running around a supermarket looking for a hand - any hand - to shake was as hilarious as it was pathetic.  By the end of the film, I thought that Chuck Robb was a nice guy who was willing to say anything to get elected, and North was a creepy demagogue who pressed a lot of populist buttons out on the stump.I also felt that the filmmakers successfully captured North's ruthless and egocentric campaign manager as he struggled with the campaign and even some of the &quot;big questions&quot; of his life.  He was the most fascinating character in the entire film, and I'm glad that the filmmakers paid so much attention to him.  They had this leftie actually ** rooting ** for North's campaign manager by the end of the film.Although they also are wont to show North and some of the far-right characters who supported him on the campaign trail, the documentary-makers did a fine job of stripping the film of any ideological bias and freely savaging both characters.

430230,A2887J6P8VPB5H,6304634242,Nichomachus,"[4, 8]","A bare-bones documentary, I wish it could have been longer. The back cover had a shot of North and his manager having a conversation with Bob Dole. I would have loved to see the conversation in the movie.This is perhaps a one of a kind political documentary. It is emblematic of the North campaign's arrogance to have allowed this kind of access behind the scenes. It is an insider's shot for the outsider, to see internal campaign discussions. One of the discussions was of the need to convince a public unenthralled with Chuck Robb, to settle for Ollie North. Everything else beside it, that was the central effort of that campaign: get the voters to 'settle' for Ollie North. They didn't pull it off.Right away, with the convention speech, we see in full force the kind of mind-numbing demagoguery that was Ollie North in 94. Most Republicans, in a conservative state like Virginia, couldn't abide hime, since they realized his polarizing effect was a danger to the party internally and externally. Only the most uneducated reaganites bought into his brand of blather, mainly because it was so boringly obtuse. Most reaganites, being educated people, couldn't buy into his program after the way he had served the President in the 80s. The Ollie scandal was THE most serious political threat to Ronald Reagan to erupt in two terms.It was dreadfully amusing to see North lie to the highschool kids, saying he hadn't lied to Congress (since his conviction had been overturned, according to his reasoning), when the documentary begins with immunized testimony of North declaring, &quot;I lied to Congress.&quot; One way or the other, the man is a liar; just not a very skilled politician.Probably the most painful, hysterical, and unforgettable clip is Chuck Robb scuttling through the grocery store, desperately trying to find someone's hand to shake. The hapless Robb should have been able to slam dunk North, as an incumbent with a whole political party united behind him. When the Robb and North campaign managers chat during the candidate debate, it's perfect insight into the candid cynicism.The campaign manager is the real star, a disgraced fringe player in Republican politics trying to make it back into the big time. Watching the behind the scenes campaign was discomfiting. &quot;Adolescent&quot; was the word that kept coming to mind. Watching their smugness and arrogance, and their &quot;wit,&quot; was like watching teenage boys finding themselves very very amusing. That's why I'm afraid this film will be a one of a kind.The candid moments of the campaign manager, his &quot;bread and circuses&quot; segue and his observations on the political process, were touching. We can't help but feel sorry for him watching him try and fight his way back from the boonies. At the same time, we can't help but feel contempt when watching him gloat over the North &quot;acceptance&quot; speech on election day.

430232,A32RX109J2TRYG,6304634242,"Paco Rivero ""Henry""","[3, 4]","This fascinating fly-on-the-wall look at Oliver North's failed bid for Congress begins as Senator John Kerry reads the long list of accusations against North during the Iran-Contra scandal: ""illegal U.S. assistance to the contras, gun running, narcotics smuggling, bombing plots, shredding relevant documents, obstruction of congress, misuse of government funds..."" While Kerry reads the charges, the movie cuts to then Veep George H. W. Bush, who says of North and his conspirators, ""Those who serve the President haven't served the President well."" We are also shown snippets of prominent Republicans, such as Bob Dole, John McCain, and John Warner, disparaging North and distancing themselves from him. (The only high profile Republican who comes out for North in the movie is Dick Cheney.) Finally, we get footage of North testifying before Congress, admitting under oath that he lied: ""I misled the Congress at that meeting, face to face. I made false statements about my activities."" During his testimony, North boasts about how proud he is of having taken money from the Ayatollah Khomeini. Yes, this is the same Oliver North that portrays himself as an honest American patriot on Fox News.Cut to seven years later as North runs for a seat in Congress. The Iran-Contra scandal dogs him every step of the way, although it's also what makes him popular with hard-core Virginia Republicans. Having already seen actual documentary footage where he admits lying to Congress, we immediately know North is being dishonest when, responding to a question posed by a high school student, he categorically denies ever having misled Congress. We're not surprised by the feeding frenzy his denial provokes among journalists outside the school, who pounce on him as soon as he steps out of the building. One reporter asks, ""Mr. North, if you were not convicted for lying to Congress, what was your conviction for?"" Poor North, literally at a loss for words, gropes for an answer, but comes up with nothing.Iran-Contra also comes back to haunt North during the debates. Witness the following exchange between North and one of his opponents, Doug Wilder:WILDER [to North]: ""How could you ride on a plane with drugs being in the plane? You've been in the company of people who have been convicted and sent away!""NORTH: ""It was fully investigated . . . I'm the most investigated man on this planet.""WILDER: ""And I will say, Colonel, there is a very good reason for that to be the case.""The crowd goes nuts with cheers as we watch the stunned, dumbstruck North reel.The documentary also explores the somewhat radical nature of the North supporters in Virginia. We visit one rally where a woman gives her son a rifle and asks him, ""What do we shoot?"" The tot responds, ""Pigeons and Democrats."" North himself spends time shooting/killing rabbits before a cheering crowd. At another event, an old Confederate matron--who describes herself as ""a DAR and a UDC and Dames of the Court of Honor""--rattles off exactly what she thinks about ""the minority race."" It's no wonder when North's enemies start tagging him with the name David Duke. To counter this, North tries to turn the race issue around on Democrat Chuck Robb, his chief rival for the Senate seat. At a press conference, North denies promoting the Confederate flag, then mysteriously accuses Robb of ""wearing a Confederate tie on the day he criticized me for it."" The movie instantly cuts to a behind-the-scenes shot of North's own Communications Director, Mark Merritt, bewildered and nervously saying, ""That sounds a little suspect to me."" Indeed, North had just given journalists--and the documentarians--another field day.The movie shows North's campaign team planning a negative political add against Robb, who had been in a scandal involving Tai Collins, a Playboy model. (By the way, Robb's father-in-law is none other than LBJ.) Instead of the sober, puritanical meeting from the born-again Christians that the North team claims to be, we get a vulgar display as North's people bite into the scandalous material with drooling relish. While North's Senior Strategist, Mark Goodin, cracks off-color jokes, the documentary suddenly breaks to give us Goodin's background. In the late 80s, as Communications Director for the Republican National Committee, Goodin had released what was taken in Washington to be an underhanded memo accusing House Speaker Tom Foley of homosexuality and calling on him to ""come out of the liberal closet."" George H. W. Bush had called the memo, which also tainted Lee Atwater, ""disgusting."" Goodin was fired. Since his job as North's Strategist is supposed to be his big comeback after the Foley debacle, Goodin's story is one of the most compelling in the documentary. Goodin takes the whole campaign personally, getting more emotional about it even than North. Goodin is also the movie's most candid character. Not only does he have a potty mouth, he says such honest things as: ""North is the triumph of anger in politics."" Indeed, we watch how North, portraying himself as the victim of a vast left wing conspiracy, tries to harness the widespread bitterness to his advantage. In one touching scene, Goodin laments the ultimate irony about American politics, perhaps about politics everywhere: campaigns are about dividing, while governing is about bringing people together. This is the dilemma politicians face.As bad as North comes off, the movie savages his Democratic opponent Chuck Robb. In one devastating scene, Robb searches for voters in a supermarket. Attracting absolutely no attention, he begins, quite intrusively and awkwardly, to approach customers in a desperate attempt to make contact. Despite Robb's total lack of charisma, however, North loses the campaign because of his constant lying about Iran-Contra, and also because of the racism of his supporters.I highly recommend this first-rate political film, particularly for the astonishing degree of access achieved by the filmmakers. I was shocked at what the North team allowed to be filmed.

It shows how desperate people can get to achieve their goals (walking in grocery store aisles pretending to be friendly).
