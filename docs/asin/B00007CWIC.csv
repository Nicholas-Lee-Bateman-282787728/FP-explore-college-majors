726920,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B00007CWIC,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[161, 161]","This DVD is based on Bob Anderson's well-known book by the same name.  It provides a solid introduction to basic athletic-type stretch, albeit in a rather dry manner.The DVD is nicely chaptered; I've listed the chapters (along with the times as given on the menu) and added my own short descriptions below.Getting Started, 7:09.  This is a short educational segment about stretching which begins by showing people engaged in various athletic activities and stretches (somewhat dated-looking).  Bob Anderson then comes on screen and reviews his philosophy of stretching.  He emphasizes that stretching is NOT exercise and that stretches should feel comfortable at all times; he focuses on ""easy"" and ""developmental"" stretches as opposed to ""intense"" stretches.  Bob also introduces his two models, Marlon and Debbie.Neck and Back Stretches, 12:14.  In this first segment, Bob leads Marlon through a series of very gentle stretches for the back, mostly from a reclined position.  There are no neck-specific stretches, but Bob reminds you to keep your neck in alignment with your back.Legs, Groin, Hips, and Feet Stretches, 12:30.  Here, Bob leads Debbie through a nice series of standing and sitting stretches for the lower body.  Most of the stretches are held for a longer duration (about 15 seconds), and Bob also includes instructions on massaging your feet, although only one foot is demonstrated.Upper Body Stretches, 10:20.  This was my favorite stretch segment.  Starting from kneeling and moving to standing, Bob again leads Marlon, this time focusing on stretches for the shoulders, neck, and torso; it ends with a nice upper body twist.Everyday Stretches (A Daily Routine), 12:29.  This final segment is instructed by Bob alone via voiceover.  Here, Bob includes stretches from each of the above segments to form a nice full-body routine.  However, because there are more stretches included, he also moves more quickly through each stretch; I would have liked to see some longer holds here.  In addition, I found the music quite distracting and jarring, as it alternated between loud bells/chimes and no music at all, which I did not feel was very conducive to relaxation.Soemthing about this DVD didn't really ""click"" with me; as mentioned above, I found it to be quite dry (Bob barely cracks a smile the entire time) and thus not very relaxing.  However, this is a solid athletic stretch DVD that could be very useful to someone who is looking for short stretching routines to incorporate into their fitness regimine and/or daily life.",4,Solid introduction to athletic stretch,1142726400,"03 19, 2006",2006,2546,"['DVD', 'based', 'Bob', 'Anderson', 'well-known', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'solid', 'introduction', 'basic', 'athletic-type', 'stretch', 'albeit', 'rather', 'dry', 'manner.The', 'DVD', 'nicely', 'chaptered', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'chapters', 'times', 'given', 'menu', 'added', 'own', 'short', 'descriptions', 'below.Getting', 'Started', '7:09', 'short', 'educational', 'segment', 'stretching', 'showing', 'people', 'engaged', 'various', 'athletic', 'activities', 'stretches', 'somewhat', 'dated-looking', 'Bob', 'Anderson', 'then', 'screen', 'reviews', 'philosophy', 'stretching', 'stretching', 'NOT', 'exercise', 'stretches', 'should', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'times', 'easy', 'developmental', 'stretches', 'opposed', 'intense', 'stretches', 'Bob', 'also', 'two', 'models', 'Marlon', 'Debbie.Neck', 'Back', 'Stretches', '12:14', 'first', 'segment', 'Bob', 'Marlon', 'series', 'very', 'gentle', 'stretches', 'back', 'mostly', 'reclined', 'position', 'are', 'neck-specific', 'stretches', 'Bob', 'keep', 'neck', 'alignment', 'back.Legs', 'Groin', 'Hips', 'Feet', 'Stretches', '12:30', 'Here', 'Bob', 'Debbie', 'nice', 'series', 'standing', 'sitting', 'stretches', 'lower', 'body', 'Most', 'stretches', 'are', 'held', 'longer', 'duration', '15', 'seconds', 'Bob', 'also', 'instructions', 'massaging', 'feet', 'only', 'one', 'foot', 'demonstrated.Upper', 'Body', 'Stretches', '10:20', 'was', 'favorite', 'stretch', 'segment', 'Starting', 'kneeling', 'moving', 'standing', 'Bob', 'again', 'Marlon', 'time', 'focusing', 'stretches', 'shoulders', 'neck', 'torso', 'nice', 'upper', 'body', 'twist.Everyday', 'Stretches', 'A', 'Daily', 'Routine', '12:29', 'final', 'segment', 'instructed', 'Bob', 'alone', 'voiceover', 'Here', 'Bob', 'stretches', 'above', 'segments', 'form', 'nice', 'full-body', 'routine', 'However', 'are', 'more', 'stretches', 'included', 'also', 'more', 'quickly', 'stretch', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'longer', 'here', 'addition', 'found', 'music', 'quite', 'distracting', 'jarring', 'alternated', 'loud', 'bells/chimes', 'music', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'very', 'conducive', 'relaxation.Soemthing', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'click', 'mentioned', 'found', 'be', 'quite', 'dry', 'Bob', 'barely', 'smile', 'entire', 'time', 'thus', 'not', 'very', 'relaxing', 'However', 'solid', 'athletic', 'stretch', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'very', 'useful', 'someone', 'who', 'looking', 'short', 'stretching', 'routines', 'incorporate', 'fitness', 'regimine', 'daily', 'life']",N/A

Some of my students wanted ""just stretching,"" without the philosophy and other hype attached to Yoga.  Bob's book was just what they needed.  It's basic, safe stretching.  No scenic backgrounds, no lobotomized Zen practitioners in rainbow spandex -- just real people doing real stretches.Bob does seem slightly awkward in front of the camera, and stammers a few times during the first ten minutes of the DVD, but then he seems to get comfortable, and the rest of the information is easy to follow.If I were asked to recommend a good, basic stretching DVD, or a great warm up for dance or athletics, this would be it.

726923,A21243B24Q0P5Q,B00007CWIC,"M. Barker ""God bless us all""","[8, 8]","The best books on stretching are indisputably by Anderson. This DVD, however, is not a duplicate of any of his books. The books are thorough and fairly exhaustive and frequently used by body work and physical therapy professionals; the dvd is introductory and minimalist and designed for, well, new recruits to being a body. You know, people who have an injury or disease that introduces them to stiffness! Very few stretches are given but every area of the body is covered. The instruction is superb as are the demonstrations. If you are new to stretching, recovering from an injury or illness, and have never been an athlete, there is no finer dvd for you. I gladly share this dvd with the public who are just learning to take responsibility for their bodies. It is helpful and kind and not overwhelming. It is probably just what you need. A great compliment to this is the book Stretching by Suzanne Martin. It is a DK book with great color photography, more stretches, yet again for the novice.",5,excellent and safe introduction to stretching for hurting people,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",2007,998,"['best', 'books', 'stretching', 'are', 'indisputably', 'Anderson', 'DVD', 'however', 'not', 'duplicate', 'books', 'books', 'are', 'thorough', 'fairly', 'exhaustive', 'frequently', 'used', 'body', 'work', 'physical', 'therapy', 'professionals', 'dvd', 'introductory', 'minimalist', 'designed', 'well', 'new', 'recruits', 'being', 'body', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'injury', 'disease', 'stiffness', 'Very', 'few', 'stretches', 'are', 'given', 'area', 'body', 'covered', 'instruction', 'superb', 'are', 'demonstrations', 'are', 'new', 'stretching', 'recovering', 'injury', 'illness', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'athlete', 'finer', 'dvd', 'gladly', 'share', 'dvd', 'public', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'learning', 'take', 'responsibility', 'bodies', 'helpful', 'kind', 'not', 'overwhelming', 'probably', 'just', 'what', 'need', 'great', 'compliment', 'book', 'Stretching', 'Suzanne', 'Martin', 'DK', 'book', 'great', 'color', 'photography', 'more', 'stretches', 'yet', 'again', 'novice']",N/A
726924,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B00007CWIC,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[62, 64]","This was originally odne in the mid 1980s & redone on dvd.It's your basic set with an in-shape young/middle age woman & in shape senior man demonstrating with Bob Anderson teaching. Bob Anderson is somewhat well know & has wrriten a few books on the subject. You'll find his stretching book is great even with it's simplified drawings that are easy to follow & has many more poses.His style is very analytical when speaking of the muscles, being detailed like saying you have to be 12-14"" away from a wall to stretch the shoulders, etc. He's very detailed oriented, but also knows to let the body tell you how far to go, never push yourself & if you yawn when you stretch, you know you opened up & released the area. This proves to me that as anaytical as he is, he's very sensitive to how the body works innately.The pros are that he's very good teacher, he knows what he speaks of both logically/scientifically & innately for people who like one way or another. He spends time on each stretch, telling you how to stretch it, how long, what to look out for, what muscles it helps, which sports/activites need that type of stretch & more. At the ends he gives a short demonstration on stretches you should do everyday that you can play over & over & follow along.The cons of this DVD is that it's old, so the music, set & pace of this program is slow & cumbersome. The production spends a little too much on the intro at the beginning showing various everyday videos of people in daily activities & how stretching is needed for health. Only basic stretches are shown that most people have seen in either beginner yoga classes, gym class or other exercise videos.This DVD is good for those who never stretch, don't think they need to & don't know how. Also for those who don't want an ""exercise"" dvd & want a more documentary type of program.",3,"Basic stretching , good teaching, needs more movements",1163289600,"11 12, 2006",2006,1841,"['was', 'originally', 'odne', 'mid', '1980s', 'redone', 'dvd.It', 'basic', 'set', 'in-shape', 'young/middle', 'age', 'woman', 'shape', 'senior', 'man', 'demonstrating', 'Bob', 'Anderson', 'teaching', 'Bob', 'Anderson', 'somewhat', 'well', 'know', 'wrriten', 'few', 'books', 'subject', ""'ll"", 'find', 'stretching', 'book', 'great', 'even', 'simplified', 'drawings', 'are', 'easy', 'follow', 'many', 'more', 'poses.His', 'style', 'very', 'analytical', 'when', 'speaking', 'muscles', 'being', 'detailed', 'saying', 'have', 'be', '12-14', 'away', 'wall', 'stretch', 'shoulders', 'etc', 'very', 'detailed', 'oriented', 'also', 'let', 'body', 'tell', 'how', 'far', 'go', 'never', 'push', 'yawn', 'when', 'stretch', 'know', 'opened', 'up', 'released', 'area', 'as', 'anaytical', 'very', 'sensitive', 'how', 'body', 'innately.The', 'pros', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'teacher', 'what', 'logically/scientifically', 'innately', 'people', 'who', 'one', 'way', 'time', 'stretch', 'telling', 'how', 'stretch', 'how', 'long', 'what', 'look', 'out', 'what', 'need', 'type', 'stretch', 'more', 'ends', 'short', 'demonstration', 'stretches', 'should', 'do', 'everyday', 'can', 'play', 'over', 'follow', 'along.The', 'cons', 'DVD', 'old', 'music', 'set', 'pace', 'program', 'slow', 'cumbersome', 'production', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'intro', 'beginning', 'showing', 'various', 'everyday', 'videos', 'people', 'daily', 'activities', 'how', 'stretching', 'needed', 'health', 'Only', 'basic', 'stretches', 'are', 'shown', 'most', 'people', 'have', 'seen', 'beginner', 'yoga', 'classes', 'gym', 'class', 'other', 'exercise', 'videos.This', 'DVD', 'good', 'who', 'never', 'stretch', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'need', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'Also', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'exercise', 'dvd', 'want', 'more', 'documentary', 'type', 'program']",N/A
