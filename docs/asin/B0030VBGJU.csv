1315788,A26TY6GCGBF5HT,B0030VBGJU,Graves,"[0, 0]","For more than 10 years the gang at MST3K entertained by playing amazingly bad movies and having commentary-like 3 annoying guys yelling stuff out in a theatre. The difference is these guys were more entertaining than the films. and the films? should never have been allowed to see the light of day. now in Rifftraz they're back and in this episode they take on the Grande Dame of apocalyptically bad movies. Ed Wood's Magnum Dopus ""Plan 9 from Outer space.""The idea is that space aliens will conquer earth by bringing the recently dead back to life. Beyond the dumb plot the fact the aliens seem too stupid to know which end of a gun to hold, a policemen with a horrific tendency to use his gun as a casual pointer and dialogue like ""You stupid, stupid human"" this would have been all set for riffing from Wood's bad direction and cheap production values. He has set that are made of cardboard and continuity is non-existent- for example in a chase scene you see a woman running at night, then a car driving by day, then a monster by night etc. The biggest flop is the fact Bella Lugosi who died half way through the film was replaced by the chiropractor of Wood's wife. a man who looks nothing Lugosi. I thought the famous actor would disappear part way through but no. he was in all the outside scenes but none of the inside scenes. so you see Lugosi sneak into a house- the chiropractor running around inside the house-and then Lugosi runs OUT of the house.All of this would be rife for any of us to go after but in the hands of the MST3K gang it is a true work of art. I was a little nervous about what was meant by 'live on stage' but what it was, was they film was shown in a theatre with the guys sitting on the stage riffing away. don't worry when the film runs you get the movies on the screen, not overviews of the studio, but what you do get is the audiences appreciative response to the guys' humor.Also included is a 1940's short about training to be an airhostess and this likewise gets the treatment t badly needs.In the end if you loved MST3K or just want to see a truly horrible movie get the treatment it deserves, grab this, you won't live to regret it!",5,MST3K goes after the worst film ever made- live on stage,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,2172,"['more', '10', 'years', 'gang', 'MST3K', 'entertained', 'playing', 'amazingly', 'bad', 'movies', 'having', 'commentary-like', '3', 'annoying', 'guys', 'yelling', 'stuff', 'theatre', 'difference', 'guys', 'were', 'more', 'entertaining', 'films', 'films', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'allowed', 'see', 'light', 'day', 'now', 'Rifftraz', ""'re"", 'back', 'episode', 'take', 'Grande', 'Dame', 'apocalyptically', 'bad', 'movies', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Magnum', 'Dopus', 'Plan', '9', 'Outer', 'space', 'idea', 'space', 'aliens', 'will', 'conquer', 'earth', 'bringing', 'recently', 'dead', 'back', 'life', 'dumb', 'plot', 'fact', 'aliens', 'seem', 'too', 'stupid', 'know', 'end', 'gun', 'hold', 'policemen', 'horrific', 'tendency', 'use', 'gun', 'casual', 'pointer', 'dialogue', 'stupid', 'stupid', 'human', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'riffing', 'Wood', 'bad', 'direction', 'cheap', 'production', 'values', 'set', 'are', 'made', 'cardboard', 'continuity', 'non-existent-', 'example', 'chase', 'scene', 'see', 'woman', 'running', 'night', 'then', 'car', 'driving', 'day', 'then', 'monster', 'night', 'etc', 'biggest', 'flop', 'fact', 'Bella', 'Lugosi', 'who', 'died', 'way', 'film', 'was', 'replaced', 'chiropractor', 'Wood', 'wife', 'man', 'who', 'nothing', 'Lugosi', 'thought', 'famous', 'actor', 'would', 'disappear', 'part', 'way', 'was', 'outside', 'scenes', 'none', 'inside', 'scenes', 'so', 'see', 'Lugosi', 'sneak', 'house-', 'chiropractor', 'running', 'around', 'house-and', 'then', 'Lugosi', 'OUT', 'house.All', 'would', 'be', 'rife', 'go', 'hands', 'MST3K', 'gang', 'true', 'work', 'art', 'was', 'little', 'nervous', 'what', 'was', 'meant', ""'live"", 'stage', 'what', 'was', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'shown', 'theatre', 'guys', 'sitting', 'stage', 'riffing', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'when', 'film', 'get', 'movies', 'screen', 'not', 'studio', 'what', 'do', 'get', 'audiences', 'appreciative', 'response', 'guys', 'humor.Also', 'included', '1940', 'short', 'training', 'be', 'airhostess', 'likewise', 'treatment', 't', 'badly', 'needs.In', 'end', 'loved', 'MST3K', 'just', 'want', 'see', 'truly', 'horrible', 'movie', 'get', 'treatment', 'grab', 'wo', ""n't"", 'live', 'regret']",RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space LIVE!

1315789,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B0030VBGJU,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[8, 9]","My review is based on seeing the live performance back in August of '09. I don't think seeing the same performance on a smaller screen will be as funny, but it will still be side-splitting hilarious. Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, & Bill Corbett are in great form and the results are well worth buying this DVD for your collection.Perhaps the only worthy criticism is that they tried to make a ""show"" of it, highlighted by a somewhat nervous host (""Internet Superstar"" Veronica Belmont), a couple of songs from Rich Kyanka that you can take or leave, and a funny performance by Corbett of ""Plans 1 - 8"". It certainly may have influenced the next Live Show (the ""Christmas Shorts"") which restricted itself to riffing the shorts alone.We start with the highly riffable short, ""Flying Stewardess"" a trip into the late 40's to see what it was like to train as a ""Stewardess"". I'm sure this will be popular with all MST3K/Rifftrax fans across the country, save perhaps for the citizens of Ft. Worth, Texas, who's city gets a good natured skewering.Getting to the main event, ""Plan 9"" is so terrible as a film that it doesn't matter that it was presented in faux-color (heavy on pastels in some scenes). The riffing was wonderful, but at one point when the alien commander gives an unreal long-winded speech the riffing stopped as the audience howled in the joy of the moment. So bad, so effeminent, so gawd-awful long it was that at the end when Corbett popped off, ""I think that was one sentence."" the theatre exploded.If you were there, this DVD is a must. If you are a fan, this DVD should be in your collection. If you are not sure, I would suggest viewing the first two Rifftrax shorts DVDs to get the flavor of the comedy.",5,I'll bet the Alien Commander can do this review in one sentence.,1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,1719,"['review', 'based', 'seeing', 'live', 'performance', 'back', 'August', ""'09"", 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'seeing', 'same', 'performance', 'smaller', 'screen', 'will', 'be', 'funny', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'side-splitting', 'hilarious', 'Mike', 'Nelson', 'Kevin', 'Murphy', 'Bill', 'Corbett', 'are', 'great', 'form', 'results', 'are', 'well', 'worth', 'buying', 'DVD', 'collection.Perhaps', 'only', 'worthy', 'criticism', 'tried', 'make', 'show', 'highlighted', 'somewhat', 'nervous', 'host', 'Internet', 'Superstar', 'Veronica', 'Belmont', 'couple', 'songs', 'Rich', 'Kyanka', 'can', 'take', 'leave', 'funny', 'performance', 'Corbett', 'Plans', '1', '8', 'certainly', 'may', 'have', 'influenced', 'next', 'Live', 'Show', 'Christmas', 'Shorts', 'restricted', 'riffing', 'shorts', 'start', 'highly', 'riffable', 'short', 'Flying', 'Stewardess', 'trip', 'late', '40', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'train', 'Stewardess', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'be', 'popular', 'MST3K/Rifftrax', 'fans', 'country', 'save', 'perhaps', 'citizens', 'Ft.', 'Worth', 'Texas', 'who', 'city', 'good', 'natured', 'skewering.Getting', 'main', 'event', 'Plan', '9', 'so', 'terrible', 'film', ""n't"", 'matter', 'was', 'presented', 'faux-color', 'heavy', 'pastels', 'scenes', 'riffing', 'was', 'wonderful', 'one', 'point', 'when', 'alien', 'commander', 'unreal', 'long-winded', 'speech', 'riffing', 'stopped', 'audience', 'howled', 'joy', 'moment', 'So', 'bad', 'so', 'effeminent', 'so', 'gawd-awful', 'long', 'was', 'end', 'when', 'Corbett', 'popped', 'off', 'think', 'was', 'one', 'sentence', 'theatre', 'exploded.If', 'were', 'there', 'DVD', 'must', 'are', 'fan', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'collection', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'suggest', 'viewing', 'first', 'two', 'Rifftrax', 'shorts', 'DVDs', 'get', 'flavor', 'comedy']",RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space LIVE!

McMullen ""kinghazzah""","[4, 5]","I was fortunate enough to see this LIVE when it ran the first time around (it was so popular that it had a ""live"" repeat performance a few weeks later same theaters) and I concur with the previous two reviews.  While I did enjoy the attempt to (loosely) connect Coulton's Zombie song to the Plan 9 movie, the movie itself was the main attraction.  I also attended the Christmas Shorts Live program which may or may not be released to DVD at sometime for home viewing and while they were still good clean fun (many more families I noticed were present at this theater, the same one where I saw Plan 9) and in true Rifftrax/MST3K form it just wasn't quite the same as this Live event.I purchased mine direct from the Rifftrax site (which actually cost a bit more than the Amazon price) and I'm not disappointed that I can now share this evening of laughs with friends who weren't able to attend or just watch it myself again, and again, and again, and again...  No matter how many times I see Plan 9 even without the Riffing just because it's the ""Citizen Kane"" of bad films but somehow the LIVE Riff even makes my old copy of the B&W; Riffed version seem somehow inadequate.  This one has the colorized version of the movie so if you want to be a purist just turn off your color bar and see it in the original GLORIOUS B&W; version as originally released by Ed Wood to theaters in 1959.  Either way just GET A COPY so you too can Laugh Out Loud!I would highly recommend this to any fan of both RIFFTRAX and MST3K even with the music.
