527213,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00003CXJC,A Customer,"[2, 9]","First, let me tell you that in my film study class at the school where I teach, this and Final Destination are the two most cited films of what not to do. Why? My biggest complaint about The Perfect Storm is that there is no main character. Initially, the audience is led to believe that it is Mark Wahlberg (Bobby), but then you become unsure when George Clooney (Capt. Tyne) comes on the scene. But that isn't even the worst of it. Generally, when a movie picks a main character, the main character is who tells the story and any scenes that don't have the main character in them must in some way relate to the main character. The Perfect Storm never does this. We follow the weather man predicting &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (He even says that and I can't stand the line when he does.) We follow the crew of a rescue helicopter. We follow the passengers on a touring sail boat that are caught in the storm. The only lee way that can be given on this is when the people that are actually attached to the sailors on the Andrea Gail are shown worrying about it. In the end, my final vote on the main character is the Andrea Gail-Yes, that's right. I voted for the boat, because it is the only consistent thing that we come back to.Second big criticism is how hard they push the relationships, especially the ones that never existed. The first 45 minutes of the movie are dedicated to making us think that all of these sailors have the most incredible, most sincere, most loving relationships of any sailors in the world. I'm assuming that this is so we will feel really bad when they all die. Well, I thought it was sad that it was a true story and that they all died, but the only relationship that I really thought meant anything was between the boy and his father-the father, Murph (John C. Reilly), really seemed devoted to and cared about his son. The last thing he thought about was how this was going to upset his son. All of the other relationships were so forced, I thought they were funny-I hope that doesn't sound morbid.Last criticism-This movie should end when the last contact with the Andrea Gail by the other ship captain, Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), because that is the last we actually hear from the ship. Everything that takes place after that is only to add suspense to a movie that we already know ends in disaster. For all we know, the crew of the Andrea Gail could have decided to turn around and sail for England, sold its catch and are now living like Kings in the Canary Islands. What happened, happened, what didn't, well, let's leave that be.I must admit that the special effects were remarkably well done and came across as being seamless-though I am by no means an expert on special effects. Other than that, this story lacked from head to toe.",1,Movies shouldn't be this bad,1071792000,"12 19, 2003",2003,2795,"['First', 'let', 'tell', 'film', 'study', 'class', 'school', 'where', 'teach', 'Final', 'Destination', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'cited', 'films', 'what', 'not', 'do', 'Why', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'main', 'character', 'Initially', 'audience', 'led', 'believe', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Bobby', 'then', 'become', 'unsure', 'when', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Capt', 'Tyne', 'scene', ""n't"", 'even', 'worst', 'Generally', 'when', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'story', 'scenes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'way', 'relate', 'main', 'character', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'never', 'follow', 'weather', 'man', 'predicting', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'quot', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'line', 'when', 'follow', 'crew', 'rescue', 'helicopter', 'follow', 'passengers', 'touring', 'sail', 'boat', 'are', 'caught', 'storm', 'only', 'lee', 'way', 'can', 'be', 'given', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'actually', 'attached', 'sailors', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'are', 'shown', 'worrying', 'end', 'final', 'vote', 'main', 'character', 'Andrea', 'Gail-Yes', 'right', 'voted', 'boat', 'only', 'consistent', 'thing', 'come', 'back', 'to.Second', 'big', 'criticism', 'how', 'hard', 'push', 'relationships', 'especially', 'ones', 'never', 'existed', 'first', '45', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'dedicated', 'making', 'think', 'sailors', 'have', 'most', 'incredible', 'most', 'sincere', 'most', 'loving', 'relationships', 'sailors', 'world', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'so', 'will', 'feel', 'really', 'bad', 'when', 'die', 'Well', 'thought', 'was', 'sad', 'was', 'true', 'story', 'died', 'only', 'relationship', 'really', 'thought', 'meant', 'anything', 'was', 'boy', 'father-the', 'father', 'Murph', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'really', 'seemed', 'devoted', 'cared', 'son', 'last', 'thing', 'thought', 'about', 'was', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'upset', 'son', 'other', 'relationships', 'were', 'so', 'forced', 'thought', 'were', 'funny-I', 'hope', ""n't"", 'sound', 'morbid.Last', 'criticism-This', 'movie', 'should', 'end', 'when', 'last', 'contact', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'other', 'ship', 'captain', 'Linda', 'Greenlaw', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'last', 'actually', 'hear', 'ship', 'Everything', 'place', 'only', 'add', 'suspense', 'movie', 'already', 'know', 'ends', 'disaster', 'know', 'crew', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'could', 'have', 'decided', 'turn', 'around', 'sail', 'England', 'sold', 'catch', 'are', 'now', 'living', 'Kings', 'Canary', 'Islands', 'What', 'happened', 'happened', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'well', 'let', 'leave', 'be.I', 'must', 'admit', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'remarkably', 'well', 'done', 'came', 'being', 'seamless-though', 'am', 'means', 'expert', 'special', 'effects', 'Other', 'story', 'lacked', 'head', 'toe']",N/A

So, I'm just going to tell you why, to put bluntly, I hated this movie! The very beginging of this movie had me going along with it. I was interesting in all the characters headed by Capt. Billy Tyne (George Clooney). But not only his characters caught my attention, also Christina Cotter (Diane Lane), Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), and Bobby Shatford. But, as soon as the storm started, believe it or not, but the movie got boring! Once the storm starts we're subjected to see the same scenes over and over again. First we see a ferocious splash of water makes its way on the boat. Then, the camera pans back, and we see the boat shift back and forth, and after we see the boat, guess what we see next? We see the water splash back on the boat, then we see the boat shift back and forth. We see the same things happen for about an hour! That's one hour of film wasted. This could of been a good movie. I could of actually liked this movie, but there was such a lack of story. Maybe if they would of showed the men on the boat caught in fear. And, yes, I know there were a FEW scenes where this was shown. Like in the last scene. But, mostly what we see is that boat swaying back and forth, how exciting!

527228,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00003CXJC,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I am a pretty big fan of this film.  I find it absorbing, moving and devastating (which are three things I look for in a film).  The cast is stellar, the story is heartbreaking and the pacing is spot on.  It is a film that slowly (yet engagingly) simmers until it boils over with a dynamic conclusion.The film tells the true story of a group of sea-fishermen who got themselves caught in the middle of a `perfect storm' off the coast of Massachusetts.  In 1991 the Andrea Gail set sail for, what promised to be, a successful `final attempt' at making up for a lackluster season.  The captain, Billy Tyne, was a stubborn yet charming man who was not going to go out without a fight.  Once out to sea, things looked great.  When three large storms collided in their path though, everything went sour.Despite the fact that we know how this ends (if you don't then I'll try and keep that a `secret'), the film remains intense and dramatic, and the ending is very much a climactic conclusion despite our foreknowledge.  That is really the best part of this film, the pacing and direction.  I totally understand the points made about the `generic' quality to the plot.  This is very much a true story in that `by the numbers' sense.  There is not a lot of character development or depth.  The men that we meet aboard the Andrea Gail are no different than the men we meet in other `natural disaster' type biopics.  So, I do wish that they had spent a little more time fleshing out their personas.  We do get a little peek into their home life during the films opening sequences, as they say goodbye to friends and family before setting sail, but that small glimpse isn't really enough to constitute depth.That aside, the acting here is very good.  Despite not having much depth of character, the cast (which includes George Clooney, John C. Reilly, Diane Lane, Mark Wahlberg and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) add layers of realism to their characters.  You feel for them, you cry for them, you root for them.  I wish that the script had fleshed them out a little more, but they work magic with what they are given.I also wanted to mention that I found the whole yacht rescue plot line to be distracting and pointless and the films one major low point.But, the real star of the show is Wolfgang Peterson.  Peterson works wonders in the water (even though his 2006 attempt at Poseidon was near dreadful in scope, it looked great).  Dating as far back as 1981 (where he should have raked in awards for his brilliant direction of `Das Boot'), Peterson has proven that small, cramped spaces surrounded by watery depths are his forte.  This is no exception.  You can feel each creek and movement and sloshing of the water against the side of his man-made prison.  It's not his strongest moment, and it doesn't quite reach Weirs transcendent direction of `03's masterpiece `Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', but what Peterson does here should not go unmentioned.  He transports you to the middle of the ocean and delivers that feeling of isolated fear, all the while surrounding you with the warm comfort of comradeship.Like I said, I love this film.  It has its faults, and it surely could have been better, but for what this film sets out to do (which is entertain), it does so gloriously.  I have not read the book, although I hear that it is stellar (and better than the film), so I may look into it someday.Until then, I will gladly watch this film again and again.",4,"Not perfect, but very, very good...",1270080000,"04 1, 2010",2010,3471,"['am', 'pretty', 'big', 'fan', 'film', 'find', 'absorbing', 'moving', 'devastating', 'are', 'three', 'things', 'look', 'film', 'cast', 'stellar', 'story', 'heartbreaking', 'pacing', 'spot', 'film', 'slowly', 'yet', 'engagingly', 'simmers', 'dynamic', 'conclusion.The', 'film', 'true', 'story', 'group', 'sea-fishermen', 'who', 'got', 'caught', 'middle', 'perfect', 'storm', 'coast', 'Massachusetts', '1991', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'set', 'sail', 'what', 'promised', 'be', 'successful', 'final', 'attempt', 'making', 'up', 'lackluster', 'season', 'captain', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'was', 'stubborn', 'yet', 'charming', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'go', 'out', 'fight', 'Once', 'sea', 'things', 'looked', 'great', 'When', 'three', 'large', 'storms', 'collided', 'path', 'everything', 'went', 'fact', 'know', 'how', 'do', ""n't"", 'then', ""'ll"", 'try', 'keep', 'secret', 'film', 'intense', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'very', 'much', 'climactic', 'conclusion', 'foreknowledge', 'really', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'pacing', 'direction', 'totally', 'understand', 'points', 'made', 'generic', 'quality', 'plot', 'very', 'much', 'true', 'story', 'numbers', 'sense', 'not', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'depth', 'men', 'meet', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'are', 'different', 'men', 'meet', 'other', 'natural', 'disaster', 'type', 'biopics', 'So', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'fleshing', 'out', 'personas', 'do', 'get', 'little', 'peek', 'home', 'life', 'films', 'opening', 'sequences', 'say', 'goodbye', 'friends', 'family', 'setting', 'sail', 'small', 'glimpse', ""n't"", 'really', 'enough', 'constitute', 'aside', 'acting', 'here', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'having', 'much', 'depth', 'character', 'cast', 'George', 'Clooney', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'add', 'layers', 'realism', 'characters', 'feel', 'cry', 'root', 'wish', 'script', 'had', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'work', 'magic', 'what', 'are', 'given.I', 'also', 'wanted', 'mention', 'found', 'whole', 'yacht', 'rescue', 'plot', 'line', 'be', 'distracting', 'pointless', 'films', 'one', 'major', 'low', 'point.But', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'Peterson', 'wonders', 'water', 'even', '2006', 'attempt', 'Poseidon', 'was', 'near', 'dreadful', 'scope', 'looked', 'great', 'Dating', 'far', 'back', '1981', 'where', 'should', 'have', 'raked', 'awards', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Das', 'Boot', 'Peterson', 'proven', 'small', 'cramped', 'spaces', 'surrounded', 'watery', 'depths', 'are', 'forte', 'exception', 'can', 'feel', 'creek', 'movement', 'sloshing', 'water', 'side', 'man-made', 'prison', 'not', 'strongest', 'moment', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reach', 'Weirs', 'transcendent', 'direction', '03', 'masterpiece', 'Master', 'Commander', 'Far', 'Side', 'World', 'what', 'Peterson', 'here', 'should', 'not', 'go', 'unmentioned', 'middle', 'ocean', 'delivers', 'feeling', 'isolated', 'fear', 'while', 'surrounding', 'warm', 'comfort', 'comradeship.Like', 'said', 'love', 'film', 'faults', 'surely', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'what', 'film', 'out', 'do', 'entertain', 'so', 'gloriously', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'hear', 'stellar', 'better', 'film', 'may', 'look', 'someday.Until', 'then', 'will', 'gladly', 'watch', 'film', 'again', 'again']",N/A

This is painfully slow and didn't work for me - I was interested in the men but it seemed to me that the film wasn't. The second half is actually pretty good but it's all due to the seamless effects and some good direction. The waves look real and even on my TV I got into the tension and fear of the storm.

527237,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B00003CXJC,Beau Yarbrough,"[1, 2]","""The Perfect Storm"" is a great example of Hollywood taking a true event that needs no embellishment or standard schmaltz to make it engaging, adding the embellishment or schmaltz anyway, and ending up with a weaker product for it.The storm of 1991 grabbed the attention of the nation for a reason. I watched all the reports of the storm from hundreds of miles away, spellbound and horrified.This film, which purports to put us in the center of the storm, fails to do the same. The problem is that we've been lulled into ""it's a typical Hollywood movie"" coma by the ridiculous speeches put into the mouths of all the actors, particularly George Clooney, who is forced to act as though being the captain of a small commercial fishing vessel isn't work, but a higher calling akin to being a priest or a brain surgeon or a kindergarten teacher. Every character gets their moment in the sun so that we'll feel their loss when it happens, and as a result, the movie takes FOREVER before we get anywhere.Ironically, the storm is somewhat skimped on: There's a brief scene which utterly fails to explain what the storm is, how it occurred and why it's noteworthy. Instead, we get every possible disaster at sea aboard the Andrea Gail first. Of course, since no one from the ship participated in the filming of this movie -- for obvious reasons -- the fact that the whole sequence has been made up out of whole cloth makes it even less engaging.And for all the talk of how much money was involved in creating the special effects, it all looks remarkably like a Hollywood invention, not a real ship at sea -- unless ships at sea are now lit like Hollywood sound stages.The poor actors trapped in this film do excellent work with the too-standard material, and make the film more watchable than it ought to be.

Why did the crew wait so long to batten down the wheelhouse windows? They knew the storm was coming. They knew how bad it would be. Why didn't they make proper preparations to meet it?Why wasn't the crew in the wheelhouse? I've been in some bad blows, and when it gets really bad, everybody usually hangs out in the wheelhouse with their survival suits within arm's reach. When it's that bad, and the boat has to turn around in monster seas, riding out the turn in the fo'c's'le or galley is the last thing anybody wants to do.Why would anyone think they could remount a SSB antenna in a 50 knot wind when the smallest whip antenna is about 23'? If the antenna doesn't rip your arm off, how are you going to splice the coax? And why not just lay out an emergency long wire antenna on deck?Speaking of which: I thought the Andrea Gail had a long wire antenna and not a whip antenna. I believe that in the photo of the Hannah Boden, which Linda Greenlaw states is a sistership of the Andrea Gail, you can see a long wire antenna running aft from the masthead to the goal post.By the way, Greenlaw states in her book that her boat, the Hannah Boden, was 100'. Sebastion Junger, the author of the book, stated on a pre-movie hype news program that the Andrea Gail was 80'. I tend to believe Greenlaw over Junger regarding LOA. And I tend to believe it had a long wire antenna. You'd think it would given its range of operation. Also, if the boat was 100' , the wave at the end would have been about 200'. My understanding is that the largest non-seismic wave ever recorded was 112', measured scientifically in the North Pacific by researchers aboard the USS Ramapo on February 7th, 1933.Also....Where can I get one of those blow torches that stays lit in 50 knots of wind and spray?Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie. I liked the effects. I thought the film makers did some good things. But I don't think the movie paid homage to the crew of the Andrea Gail or commercial fishermen. I think Junger's melodramatic overspeculations of the sinking (not to mention his speculation about what it's like to drown) are an insult to the thousands of fishermen and other seafarers who've lost their limbs and worse in much less spectacular ways. In truth, the vast majority of commercial fishing accidents and sinkings aren't caused by gigantic Hollywood waves. They're the result of separate incidents and seemingly insignificant details stacking-up and falling like a house of cards.With all due respect to the people of Gloucester and the friends and family of those who died on the Andrea Gail, and to the film makers and the actors, I humbly submit a different cause and effect scenario with regard to the sinking.In my opinion, had the crew been given the time depicted in both the book and the movie, the ending might have been quite different. Those men were experienced and capable fisherman who had previously handled anything the sea had thrown at them. What probably happened was they started home with a freighted boat. It got rough, very rough, and the vessel started taking on water, probably from some insidious place in the stern, e.g. the rudder box or shaft seal. They didn't know she was taking on water until it was too late, at which time the vessel rolled and sank before they could launch the raft, get into their survival suits, or trigger the EPIRB. How many times has it happened that way? A freighted boat. A slow leak.

The movie picks up once the storm rolls in, but the weather guy at the TV station in Boston commenting on the meteorology to bring you along was pretty cheesy, too.  Everyone has a pretty good idea how this ends up, but I'll try not to spoil it. There is a pretty good side story with a Coast Guard ship and an Air Force Reserve helicopter. The movie condenses down a couple of stories from the book, and takes some other liberties that have made other viewers skeptical about this plot. Yes, the Air Force helicopter really went out on a rescue in the storm, and it did in-flight refueling, although the helicopter's mission didn't have to do with the Andrea Gail. The rest of the helicopter's story is pretty much portrayed correctly.

There's quite a bit of overacting in the movie and a number of subplots and events that were obviously added in to brighten up what was an otherwise sad story.The Andrea Gail sets out for a late-season fishing voyage right before a number of meteorological events trigger one of the largest storms in history on the Eastern Seaboard. We get to see many events that occurred including the perils of a yacht, a Coast Guard helicopter crew (the real story about these guys was a heckuva lot more interesting than the movie version; I saw it on Dateline or 20/20 about a year ago), and the fishermen on the Andrea Gail.The story is interesting enough as told in the movie, but the viewer has to wonder how much is true and how much is just made up for entertainment's sake. After all, no one really knows what was happening on this doomed voyage, do they?I enjoyed the little look into New England fishery life even if I suspect it was made more melodramatic than it needed to be. The boat, the men and the action on the high seas is great to watch. The storm effects (CGI I'm sure) were also very cool. Both George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg do a fine job as the captain and crewman, respectively, of the doomed Andrea Gail.All in all, a good, entertaining movie.

527260,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B00003CXJC,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[8, 11]","The special effects are quite good.  It's likely you will be too caught up in the various rescue attempts at the end of the film you won't much care if a slight digital tear is noticeable, or if a shot suddenly shifts perspective to cover up something that you shouldn't see.The last hour of The Perfect Storm -- from an enjoyable fishing sequence, through the inevitable, predictable, mother of all storm sequences, is very good film-making indeed.  It's unfortunate the first hour is such by the numbers, t.v. disaster movie of the week junk.  The rather thinly drawn characters are quickly introduced with scenes owing a great debt of gratitude to Steinbeck's Cannery Row and Hemingway.  On top of the cliche's the almost stock characters have been somewhat cleaned up to preserve a PG-13 rating.The fact these stock, thinly drawn cliched characters are played by actors who are capable of delivering good performances but aren't asked to try very hard to do so, only makes its worse.  The Script isn't awful but its most likely one of those scripts by committee where dozens of hands fine tuned the thing until it was as slick, manipulative, and politically correct as possible although only Billy Wittliff gets final writing credit. He based the screenplay on the book by Sebastian Junger which centers around the fate of the Gloucester, Mass. Sword fishing boat, Andrea Gail, and its crew.Since the film is based on a well known true story from a best-selling book, the film probably won't have any element of surprise which might cut way down on the suspense factor for you. I give a lot of credit to director Wolfgang Petersen, the films editor, composer James Horner, the production designer  and the special effects crew for making the last sequences as thrilling and exciting as they are.We meet the crew of the ship and some of their friends.  There's the  salty bitter  Capt. Billy Tyne (George Clooney ) who's had a run of bad luck recently and is almost desperate to redeem himself with a large catch of fish. There's the veteran fisherman, Murph (John C. Reilly)  who has a love/hate relationship with the sea.  He also doesn't get along at all with fellow crewman, Sully (William Fichtner). We aren't sure why they are at each other throats except it might have something to do a former fishing trip or perhaps some old rivalry over Murph's wife. Murph has separate from his wife because of the hard fishing life he won't give up, and you see he loves his 9 or 10 year old son very very much. We know this because rather than get laid, he prefers to play pool with his son in the local pub.  There's Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) the new guy, who's just become addicted to the sea at the same time he's fallen in love with the girl of his dreams a divorced mom of two (Diane Lane).  He's torn between his love of adventure and fishing and missing his woman.  There's the dumb guy Bugsy (John Hawkes), who lacks social skills of any kind and serves as a source of much of the film's humor as he attempts to get laid and then is befriended by a large woman in a supposed to be genuine way. We also have Alfred Pierre, (Allen Payne) a Jamaican who is fishing for the paycheck, but has been with the `Skip' for several fishing trips.There's also fellow Captain Linda (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) who likes Captain Billy Tyne and hints she'd like to be more than friends to him.  It's another mostly thankless cardboard role for a very capable actress.Let me make a quick mention of actor Michael Ironside, who plays the owner of the fish company the various ship captains sell their fish too.  For years, this Canadian actor has made a career of wonderfully portraying some of the slimiest villains and unlikeable characters you've ever seen (you won't ever forget him from Scanners).  He always seems to find a way to elevate even the dullest of stock characters into something, somewhat memorable.  The crew go out too far to go after their fish and when the ice machine breaks down they decide to try to fight their way back through the storm (they underestimate) so their huge catch of fish doesn't spoil and they make lots of money.There's another group of folks who are literally inserted into the film.  We don't know a thing about them except they are played by capable actors Cherry Jones, Bob Gunton and Karen Allen..  All we know is they are on a luxury sail boat and as we cut back to them on occasion we realize they  will be caught in the big storm.  Yes, there is a very exciting attempt rescue sequence involving these people, but it's an insult to these actors at how completely wasted their talents are playing special effect extras.  They aren't even given enough screen time to develop cardboard Irwin Allen type caricatures.Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly and George Clooney appear very comfortable with each other. They've paired up in various combination in films like Boogie Nights and The Three Kings.  Unfortunately there really isn't much for them sink their teeth into, in terms of character, or character driven development.  This film turns an actual tragic event into a special effect extravaganza along the lines of  the biggest budgeted Irwin Allen film ever made.  I guess Irene who's was left on the shore waiting for Bugsy is the Shelley Winters of the film.Yes, the last hour of the film manages to thrill and excite.  The film-makers know their stuff which should come as no surprise because the director Wolfgang Petersen helmed the impressive near classic Das Boot (about the Germans in the submarine) almost 20 years ago.I guess what bothers me most is that so many talented people were involved in this project, it's very disappointing they all signed on to what amounts to little more than a very expensive by the numbers disaster movie of the week.  Everyone should have concentrated on making a good film, not just one with some thrilling special effects.Chris Jarmick co-Author of The Glass Cocoon (with Serena F.

I've been a fan since it was released and will still gather round to watch this film every once in a while just because I like it that much.  That said, it really falters in a few areas, and if those few areas had been adjusted it could resonate as a great movie and not just a movie I really enjoy.  You must know what I mean...right?First off the characters are less than amply elaborated on.  I want to know what really makes them tick.  Yes, they explore, above all else, the relationship between Wahlberg and Lane's characters, but even their relationship is less than fully explained.  Too me the closest I came to sympathy was for John C. Reilly's character, but that was mostly out of concern for his poor son and less about the fact that I knew anything about him.So, that's one thing...give me more of who I'm concerned for.Next I would have liked the focus to have been, especially in the end, more on the Andrea Gail and less on everyone else.  You have this couple on a yacht and I'm thinking, ""I didn't bank on watching this, I want to see the crew"" and the mere fact that the ending drags on a little too much because of the extra attention to the sub-plotted rescue mission (which I am aware also played into the reason the rescue copter didn't make it out to the Andrea Gail, but that could have easily been shortened and or skirted around) kind of creates an uneasy anxious anticipation for the credits to begin to roll.Other than that I feel this is Grade A entertainment, and as I said, I really like this film, it's beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, and the story (almost all true life events of this magnitude are) is truly entrancing, I just would have liked some meat slapped onto the bones of this film, for Peterson to really flesh out these men and women and create in us more than just a passing cause for despair but make us know and love them enough to have us weeping for them long after the credits have graced the screen.",3,"Falls short of greatness, but it's still great...",1161302400,"10 20, 2006",2006,2016,"['First', 'off', 'want', 'say', 'really', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'was', 'released', 'will', 'still', 'gather', 'round', 'watch', 'film', 'once', 'while', 'just', 'like', 'much', 'said', 'really', 'few', 'areas', 'few', 'areas', 'had', 'been', 'adjusted', 'could', 'resonate', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'movie', 'really', 'enjoy', 'must', 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'right', 'First', 'characters', 'are', 'less', 'amply', 'elaborated', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'tick', 'Yes', 'explore', 'else', 'relationship', 'Wahlberg', 'Lane', 'characters', 'even', 'relationship', 'less', 'fully', 'explained', 'Too', 'closest', 'came', 'sympathy', 'was', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'character', 'was', 'mostly', 'concern', 'poor', 'son', 'less', 'fact', 'knew', 'anything', 'him.So', 'one', 'thing', 'give', 'more', 'who', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'for.Next', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'focus', 'have', 'been', 'especially', 'end', 'more', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'less', 'everyone', 'else', 'have', 'couple', 'yacht', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'did', ""n't"", 'bank', 'watching', 'want', 'see', 'crew', 'mere', 'fact', 'ending', 'drags', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'extra', 'attention', 'sub-plotted', 'rescue', 'mission', 'am', 'aware', 'also', 'played', 'reason', 'rescue', 'copter', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'out', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'shortened', 'skirted', 'kind', 'creates', 'uneasy', 'anxious', 'anticipation', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll.Other', 'feel', 'Grade', 'A', 'entertainment', 'said', 'really', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'story', 'almost', 'true', 'life', 'events', 'magnitude', 'are', 'truly', 'entrancing', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'meat', 'slapped', 'bones', 'film', 'Peterson', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'men', 'women', 'create', 'more', 'just', 'passing', 'cause', 'despair', 'make', 'know', 'love', 'enough', 'have', 'weeping', 'long', 'credits', 'have', 'graced', 'screen']",N/A

Ultimately the movie made me think of a scene from &quot;Educating Rita&quot; where the teacher discusses the difference between tragic and Tragedy.  In the discussion the teacher asks that if a man falls off the roof of his house, is it a Tragedy?  The answer, ultimately, was no.  It was merely tragic, because there wasn't enough involvement of the man in his own demise.  There was no fatal flaw in the man who fell, just a bad judgement call, or perhaps he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  This was central to what was wrong with The Perfect Storm.  Had it been done as a documentary with a few dramatised moments, it may have been more effective.As is often the case in movies today, the special effects are the stars.  Sadly enough, in this case, the star doesn't turn up until near the end of the movie.It is a credit to Wolfgang Peterson's skill that the movie managed to be as engaging as it was.

527269,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXJC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Well, my love for disaster movies finally conquered my utter disdain for George Clooney, and I watched The Perfect Storm.  The fact that the film is based on a true story in which several men did lose their lives makes it a little difficult to review, as I feel compelled to temper some of the comments I might have otherwise made.  I'm sure the tragedy of the actual events made it hard to film, as well - and I think that explains the slow-moving, problematic opening 30-40 minutes.  The obvious intent is for us to get to know the men of the Andrea Gail, to see what life is like in a New England fishing community, and to see why and how these men risked the hardships of sword fishing out on the open ocean.  It's not an easy life - leaving loved ones behind for days or weeks on end, working like a dog to haul in giant fish without being injured or killed in any number of ways, never knowing if you were even going to catch enough to fish make the trip worthwhile.  For some, it's about the money - not greed, just a desperate need for the money to take care of you and yours.  Mostly, though, it's about the love - love for the sea, for fishing, etc.  A lot of jobs don't really define the man (or woman) - but a sword fisherman is a sword fisherman.  That's what Billy Tyne was, but he was also a man on a losing streak, and his effort to redeem himself and his men led the Andrea Gail straight into disaster.Unfortunately, in terms of the movie itself, the first 30-40 minutes are insufferably long, failing to make me care about any of the characters - even Diane Lane grated on my nerves as the girlfriend who didn't want her man to go back out again.  Then the boat finally sails, and the men go fishing.  An hour's gone by, and you're wondering when this storm is ever going to show up.  As for Tyne and his crew, things just aren't right from the start - they're not catching a significant number of fish, a couple of guys are almost killed, the crewmen are fighting amongst themselves, and no one is the least bit happy.  Ignoring all these ominous signs, Tyne decides to head on east way over to the Flemish Cap, caring little for the weather at his back - until it's time to head home, of course.  You would think a fisherman, more than any other person in the world, would have a healthy respect for the weather.  Tyne knows there's extremely rough weather in between the Andrea Gale and home, but he and his men decide to plow on through rather than risk losing all of the fish they have finally caught.  Unbeknownst for the most part to Tyne and his guys, weather conditions are now going to heck in a hand basket, as a huge hurricane, another burgeoning hurricane, and an area of dangerously low pressure smack together to form the 1991 Halloween Nor'easter (""the perfect storm"") - and the Andrea Gale is heading right down its throat.Alongside the life-and-death struggle that now plays out aboard the Andrea Gale, we also get the chance to observe the efforts of Coast Guard rescuers trying to save the lives of some stranded boaters.  A yacht on its way to Bermuda proves its just plain dumb ""all I need's a compass"" captain a complete and utter fool, and a helicopter is dispatched to try and save the three individuals onboard.  Unlike the footage of the Andrea Gale's struggle, the Coast Guard rescue effort is downright compelling - and gets even more compelling later on when the rescuers themselves need rescuing.  The film is a great tribute to these real-life heroes (one of whom was lost during the events chronicled here); you just can't say enough about these brave guys.  It's a pity the entire film wasn't about them.It's actually rather surprising just how little I, as a viewer, emotionally invested in the story of the Andrea Gale.  The crewmen weren't men I really liked, especially the headstrong captain who puts his own selfish needs over the welfare of his crew, and they did pretty much know what they were getting into when they decided to risk heading home through the storm.  The special effects were impressive, but for me, the emotion of the whole tragedy just never manifested itself in this story - and that is the main weakness of the film.",4,"Interesting, but it just doesn't resonate on an emotional level",1151193600,"06 25, 2006",2006,4196,"['Well', 'love', 'disaster', 'movies', 'finally', 'conquered', 'utter', 'disdain', 'George', 'Clooney', 'watched', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'fact', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'several', 'men', 'did', 'lose', 'lives', 'little', 'difficult', 'review', 'feel', 'compelled', 'temper', 'comments', 'might', 'have', 'otherwise', 'made', ""'m"", 'sure', 'tragedy', 'actual', 'events', 'made', 'hard', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'think', 'slow-moving', 'problematic', 'opening', '30-40', 'minutes', 'obvious', 'intent', 'get', 'know', 'men', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'see', 'what', 'life', 'New', 'England', 'fishing', 'community', 'see', 'why', 'how', 'men', 'risked', 'hardships', 'sword', 'fishing', 'out', 'open', 'ocean', 'not', 'easy', 'life', 'leaving', 'loved', 'ones', 'days', 'weeks', 'end', 'working', 'dog', 'haul', 'giant', 'fish', 'being', 'injured', 'killed', 'number', 'ways', 'never', 'knowing', 'were', 'even', 'going', 'catch', 'enough', 'fish', 'make', 'trip', 'worthwhile', 'money', 'not', 'greed', 'just', 'desperate', 'need', 'money', 'take', 'care', 'yours', 'Mostly', 'though', 'love', 'love', 'sea', 'fishing', 'etc', 'lot', 'jobs', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'define', 'man', 'woman', 'sword', 'fisherman', 'sword', 'fisherman', 'what', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'man', 'losing', 'streak', 'effort', 'redeem', 'men', 'led', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'straight', 'disaster.Unfortunately', 'terms', 'movie', 'first', '30-40', 'minutes', 'are', 'insufferably', 'long', 'failing', 'make', 'care', 'characters', 'even', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'grated', 'nerves', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'man', 'go', 'back', 'out', 'again', 'Then', 'boat', 'finally', 'men', 'go', 'fishing', 'hour', 'gone', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'when', 'storm', 'ever', 'going', 'show', 'up', 'Tyne', 'crew', 'things', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'right', 'start', ""'re"", 'not', 'catching', 'significant', 'number', 'fish', 'couple', 'guys', 'are', 'almost', 'killed', 'crewmen', 'are', 'fighting', 'amongst', 'one', 'least', 'bit', 'happy', 'Ignoring', 'ominous', 'signs', 'Tyne', 'head', 'east', 'way', 'Flemish', 'Cap', 'caring', 'little', 'weather', 'back', 'time', 'head', 'home', 'course', 'would', 'think', 'fisherman', 'more', 'other', 'person', 'world', 'would', 'have', 'healthy', 'respect', 'weather', 'Tyne', 'extremely', 'rough', 'weather', 'Andrea', 'Gale', 'home', 'men', 'decide', 'plow', 'rather', 'risk', 'losing', 'fish', 'have', 'finally', 'caught', 'Unbeknownst', 'most', 'part', 'Tyne', 'guys', 'weather', 'conditions', 'are', 'now', 'going', 'heck', 'hand', 'basket', 'huge', 'hurricane', 'burgeoning', 'hurricane', 'area', 'dangerously', 'low', 'pressure', 'smack', 'together', 'form', '1991', 'Halloween', ""Nor'easter"", 'perfect', 'storm', 'Andrea', 'Gale', 'heading', 'right', 'down', 'life-and-death', 'struggle', 'now', 'out', 'Andrea', 'Gale', 'also', 'get', 'chance', 'observe', 'efforts', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'trying', 'save', 'lives', 'stranded', 'boaters', 'yacht', 'way', 'Bermuda', 'just', 'plain', 'dumb', 'need', 'compass', 'captain', 'complete', 'utter', 'fool', 'helicopter', 'dispatched', 'try', 'save', 'three', 'individuals', 'onboard', 'footage', 'Andrea', 'Gale', 'struggle', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'rescue', 'effort', 'downright', 'compelling', 'even', 'more', 'compelling', 'later', 'when', 'rescuers', 'need', 'rescuing', 'film', 'great', 'tribute', 'real-life', 'heroes', 'one', 'whom', 'was', 'lost', 'events', 'chronicled', 'here', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'brave', 'guys', 'pity', 'entire', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'them.It', 'actually', 'rather', 'surprising', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'viewer', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'story', 'Andrea', 'Gale', 'crewmen', 'were', ""n't"", 'men', 'really', 'liked', 'especially', 'headstrong', 'captain', 'who', 'own', 'selfish', 'needs', 'welfare', 'crew', 'did', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'getting', 'when', 'decided', 'risk', 'heading', 'home', 'storm', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'impressive', 'emotion', 'whole', 'tragedy', 'just', 'never', 'manifested', 'story', 'main', 'weakness', 'film']",N/A
527270,A3KOVFORKXQ2U9,B00003CXJC,Daniel McInnis,"[2, 3]","The Perfect Storm marks the second collaboration of Mark Wahlberg and George Clooney but don't expect another Three Kings here.  Whereas Kings was a smart, liberal-minded action film that dared to have a social concious, this is a movie more of the rah-rah, skimp on the plot variety (as we've come to expect around the July 4th weekend).  If I had to choose one redeeming quality to justify my two star rating (rather than one), I'd have to point out how refreshing it is to see scruffy, blue-collar workers potrayed in film.  Much like Erin Brockovich it deals with lower middle class people, which we're unaccustomed to seeing in mainstream Hollywood movies and that's a nice touch.  I can only assume that's what attracted this very talented cast, the only one of which to get away clean is John C. Reilly for whom it's almost impossible to give a poor performance.Clooney stars as a Gloucester sword boat captain who's hit a proveribal bump in the road.  His last few times out he's come home short, so he dedicated himself to doing a turnaround which he hopes will break his string of bad luck.  Antagonizing him into doing so is the boat's owner (Michael Ironside) who, because we can't exactly hold Mother Nature accountable, is cast in the role of the &quot;bad guy.&quot;  Being as he's the evil capitalist (as though the fisherman have more noble intentions), he inadvertantly pushes Clooney and his crew further and further out to sea until they can find the fish and set the market.They travel all the way out to the Flemish Cap, which if my map reading skills are up to snuff is about halfway out into the Atlantic.  From there they proceed to catch enough fish to make somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars.  But when the ice machine clunks out they're left with a choice, wait it out and let the fish spoil or ride back through the storm.  As I'm sure you've already guessed they decide to tough it out, not knowing that Hurricane Grace is about to collide with two other fronts to create the greatest storm on record.We cut back and forth from them fighting the elements (and eachother), to land where they all have someone to come home to.  These moments are the worst of the film and have been set up by and over-extended opening introduction to the fisherman and their loved ones, for whom we're supposed to be sobbing for at the picture's end.  Especially bad is Diane Lane, who must've given a hell of a performance in The Cotton Club to still be finding work after her horrendous turn in Murder at 1600.  I hate to single her out but in the company of such a fine cast she can't help but sick out.As for Wolfgang Petersen, he's done much better work with Das Boot and Outbreak, and here seems to be overly aware of the expectations set forth by the film's bloated budget so he aims to appeal to wider audiences by dumbing down on the story.  I can really see where he was trying to make a better movie than the one he ended up with, but he just can't salvage a terribly contrived story that actually has the audacity to assume the events surrounding this tragedy, using a paint-by-numbers formula to fill in the blanks.Maybe the filmmakers should've been more vague or written an entirely fictional story, rather than doing these men the disservice of presuming how they met their end.  I know it's based on the Sebastian Junger book which I've never read, and probably never will after seeing this, but I just can't help but feel they should've left well enough alone.

We are not shown real people, we are *told* what to think. Then  we are taken to  sea, where we are introduced  to some random other characters (in a sailboat, and a helicopter) who are  also  in trouble. But who cares? I don't care  about the main characters, much less these completely random  unknowns. The special effects are decent, but even in the  storm the writing and acting are wretched. The  sailors are stupid and incompetent, and even though they are continually  on the edge of death, they have  little  cheering/bonding sessions every time they fish one another out of the  drink. The ending of the movie is  embarassingly maudlin, pumping (and pumping, and pumping) for tears after  cheating us of any real human  beings to care  about.To top it off, the musical score is  intrusive and, like the rest of the flick, ham-handed and manipulative.  Strings swell every time somebody so much as  twitches, until the audience is numb.I was  insulted by this movie, and I'm insulted that audiences no longer have the  capacity to be outraged when  they are  pandered to and their intelligence is repeatedly insulted.

The writers have made me care for each person in this script, which makes the tragic end all the more powerful and emotional. I felt that I lost some people I in some way knew.

The story is realistic, and direction by Petersen is outstanding (the director of Air force One). The Perfect storm was one of the summer's best films in my opinion, and had a very strong cast (including Clooney and Wahlberg). The effects in the film are incredible, even by today's standards,  the best bit for me was, when the shark was pulled onto the fishing boat. This film included for the first time a part for Clooney when he wasn't Mr. Wright, and he played the part incredibly well. People who don't want a spoiler please stop now!The fact that some people don't like this film because it may not have the happiest of ending just makes me laugh, this is based upon a true story, do these people actually think a boat could survive a storm like this. This may be a fault caused by Hollywood, and in some way by Petersen himself. I liked Air force one, but it was a topic Hollywood movie, the goodies win.

527280,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00003CXJC,Dennis Littrell,"[13, 27]","This is not as bad as I feared. I would never have watched it except that it was mentioned twice in a noncommittal way in a book I had just finished reading, Stuart Pimm's The World According to Pimm: A Scientist Audits the Earth (2001). It starts out like something from any of half a dozen big project Hollywood directors, e.g., James Cameron (Titanic) or Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat), with faux realism and intrusive atmospheric sights and sounds and bits of background sound-bite conversations played too loud. I'm already shifting in my seat when I realize that Wolfgang Petersen, who produced and directed The Perfect Storm is none other than the very same Wolfgang Petersen who produced and directed the internationally acclaimed German language classic, Das Boot (1981), one of the best war movies of all time. So now I'm thinking, how bad can this be?Turns out that The Perfect Storm is one of those movies that can't decide whether it's a man's action flick or a woman's relationship saga. Petersen spends an inordinate amount of time giving each of his crew members some kind of relationship before sending them off into the mother of all storms, reminding me of movies where the guys go away to war and the women stay behind keeping the home fires burning. Enough time is spent in the bar to make me think we're watching &quot;Cheers&quot; or we're on shore leave before the final assault. Strange thing about this is that Petersen, in making Das Boot, didn't care in the slightest about establishing relationships or engaging the female audience. But times have changed. Today's Hollywood director knows that to get people into the theaters you've got to make sure that women's issues and interests are addressed.&quot;Not that there's anything wrong with that!&quot; (A quote from Seinfeld in a different context, that you might recall.) But imagine how diluted and unfocused Das Boot would have been had Petersen spent half an hour delineating each of the crew's fraus and frauleins.However, some of the work was worth the effort. The relationship between Irene and Bugsy (Rusty Schwimmer and John Hawkes, both doing a good job) was different and compelling: &quot;I wish it was night so I could say, Goodnight, Irene.&quot; He speaks true corn. &quot;There'll be a time for that&quot; she rejoins, to the point and suggestively. (I'm paraphrasing from memory.) But the relationship between male and female fishboat captains (George Clooney and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) never got off the ground, and I yawned through the all too familiar quandary of the young lovers, Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.Anyway, at last we are out the harbor and onto the fishing grounds. I was hoping for some real authentic, little known color about long-line fishermen, and I got some: the storage cells where the fish are packed with ice, the lines going out baited, the shark on deck, still biting. But that was about it. I was also hoping for a fisherman's point of view on the world-wide controversy about over-fishing and the &quot;Tragedy of the Commons,&quot; but all we get is that they're not making as much money as they would like, and the boat's owner gets more than seems fair.Okay, so let's see the storm. And we do and it's a monster, with massive waves throwing people all over the place threatening to swallow up the little fishing boat. Best action shot: the wave blasting the cargo containers off the deck like toys (actually they were toys). But I kept thinking, who really knows what it was like on that boat in the middle of that storm? The boat flips over and flips upright and then flips again. Nobody knows who tried to get out and who didn't. And were the lights still on? I would think it would get pitch black at night under the water. What I'm saying is, the cheap cutouts used for some of the water scenes in Das Boot were more effective than the millions spent on special effects for The Perfect Storm. At least in the former we knew they were merely simulations. Here the attempt at realism underscores the fact that I'm watching a movie. Oh, and the musical score: not only intrusive, but unnecessarily directive in the sense that it's telling me how I should feel about what I'm watching.Bottom line: This is just interesting enough to keep a drowsy couple awake on a Sunday night. But be forewarned, the kids will want to stay up and see the storm.",3,"Uneven, Hollywood-ized",1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,4379,"['not', 'as', 'bad', 'feared', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'watched', 'was', 'mentioned', 'twice', 'noncommittal', 'way', 'book', 'had', 'just', 'finished', 'reading', 'Stuart', 'Pimm', 'World', 'According', 'Pimm', 'Scientist', 'Audits', 'Earth', '2001', 'out', 'something', 'dozen', 'big', 'project', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'e.g.', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Titanic', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'Chocolat', 'faux', 'realism', 'intrusive', 'atmospheric', 'sights', 'sounds', 'bits', 'background', 'sound-bite', 'conversations', 'played', 'too', 'loud', ""'m"", 'already', 'shifting', 'seat', 'when', 'realize', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'who', 'produced', 'directed', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'none', 'other', 'very', 'same', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'who', 'produced', 'directed', 'internationally', 'acclaimed', 'German', 'language', 'classic', 'Das', 'Boot', '1981', 'one', 'best', 'war', 'movies', 'time', 'So', 'now', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'how', 'bad', 'can', 'be', 'out', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'one', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'decide', 'man', 'action', 'flick', 'woman', 'relationship', 'saga', 'Petersen', 'inordinate', 'amount', 'time', 'giving', 'crew', 'members', 'kind', 'relationship', 'sending', 'off', 'mother', 'storms', 'reminding', 'movies', 'where', 'guys', 'go', 'away', 'war', 'women', 'stay', 'keeping', 'home', 'fires', 'burning', 'Enough', 'time', 'spent', 'bar', 'make', 'think', ""'re"", 'watching', 'quot', 'Cheers', 'quot', ""'re"", 'shore', 'leave', 'final', 'assault', 'Strange', 'thing', 'Petersen', 'making', 'Das', 'Boot', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'slightest', 'establishing', 'relationships', 'engaging', 'female', 'audience', 'times', 'have', 'changed', 'Today', 'Hollywood', 'director', 'get', 'people', 'theaters', ""'ve"", 'got', 'make', 'sure', 'women', 'issues', 'interests', 'are', 'addressed.', 'quot', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'quot', 'quote', 'Seinfeld', 'different', 'context', 'might', 'recall', 'imagine', 'how', 'diluted', 'unfocused', 'Das', 'Boot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'had', 'Petersen', 'spent', 'hour', 'delineating', 'crew', 'fraus', 'frauleins.However', 'work', 'was', 'worth', 'effort', 'relationship', 'Irene', 'Bugsy', 'Rusty', 'Schwimmer', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'doing', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'different', 'compelling', 'quot', 'wish', 'was', 'night', 'so', 'could', 'say', 'Goodnight', 'Irene.', 'quot', 'true', 'corn', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'time', 'quot', 'point', 'suggestively', ""'m"", 'paraphrasing', 'memory', 'relationship', 'male', 'female', 'fishboat', 'captains', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'never', 'got', 'ground', 'yawned', 'too', 'familiar', 'quandary', 'young', 'lovers', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Diane', 'Lane.Anyway', 'last', 'are', 'out', 'harbor', 'fishing', 'grounds', 'was', 'hoping', 'real', 'authentic', 'little', 'known', 'color', 'long-line', 'fishermen', 'got', 'storage', 'cells', 'where', 'fish', 'are', 'packed', 'ice', 'lines', 'going', 'out', 'baited', 'shark', 'deck', 'still', 'biting', 'was', 'was', 'also', 'hoping', 'fisherman', 'point', 'view', 'world-wide', 'controversy', 'over-fishing', 'quot', 'Tragedy', 'Commons', 'quot', 'get', ""'re"", 'not', 'making', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'would', 'like', 'boat', 'owner', 'more', 'fair.Okay', 'let', 'see', 'storm', 'do', 'monster', 'massive', 'waves', 'throwing', 'people', 'place', 'threatening', 'swallow', 'up', 'little', 'fishing', 'boat', 'Best', 'action', 'shot', 'wave', 'blasting', 'cargo', 'containers', 'deck', 'toys', 'actually', 'were', 'toys', 'kept', 'thinking', 'who', 'really', 'what', 'was', 'boat', 'middle', 'storm', 'boat', 'flips', 'upright', 'then', 'flips', 'again', 'Nobody', 'who', 'tried', 'get', 'out', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'were', 'lights', 'still', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'get', 'pitch', 'black', 'night', 'water', 'What', ""'m"", 'saying', 'cheap', 'cutouts', 'used', 'water', 'scenes', 'Das', 'Boot', 'were', 'more', 'effective', 'millions', 'spent', 'special', 'effects', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'least', 'former', 'knew', 'were', 'merely', 'simulations', 'Here', 'attempt', 'realism', 'fact', ""'m"", 'watching', 'movie', 'Oh', 'musical', 'score', 'not', 'only', 'intrusive', 'unnecessarily', 'directive', 'sense', 'telling', 'how', 'should', 'feel', 'what', ""'m"", 'watching.Bottom', 'line', 'just', 'interesting', 'enough', 'keep', 'drowsy', 'couple', 'awake', 'Sunday', 'night', 'be', 'forewarned', 'kids', 'will', 'want', 'stay', 'up', 'see', 'storm']",N/A

527283,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXJC,D. Litton,"[8, 13]","In one of the most enthusiastic and enthralling historical pieces since Titanic, &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; hits the waves and hits them hard, soaking audiences the world over with a slam-bang ensemble of stunning visual effects and an explosive sound design that accompanies a heartfelt true story as told in the best-selling novel by Sebastian Junger. It's one of those movies that, after you see it, you find that you had so much fun during the experience that you want to relive it all over again.The plot tells the story of the Andrea Gail, which is shown in the beginning moments as coming in from a trip at sea, carrying with it a load of fish that is less than satisfying to the owner of the boat. This puts the boat's captain, Billy Tyne, under the added pressure of making a better catch the next trip. He is soon given an ultimatum: he must leave on a trip the following day and bring back a bigger catch if he wants to keep his position as captain. So it's off to sea again for the crew, but not before we are given a warming glance at each one's life on land. Their luck looks like it's running out, so they venture further out into the Atlantic to increase their find. While they are at sea, three storm systems, one of which is a hurricane, begin to move towards one another, and will soon collide directly in the path of the Andrea Gail's return back to port. Tyne gives his crew a choice: they can run away from the storm, or head right into it and attempt to make it back home.Now, we all know that it wouldn't be a true summer movie if they decided to tuck tail and run, so you guessed it right; they decide to head for port. This is where the action of the film will pick up the pace and never stop moving. As the men battle for their lives at sea, one disaster solved is another brought about, and it's non-stop action up until the gut-wrenching, breathtakingly climactic ending that comes too soon for those deeply involved in its plot.It has been said that special effects should not be allowed to dominate a story unless it is crucial to the telling of the tale. This movie is an example of how costly special effects can create the setting for the movie's intense action sequences, as most of them would be impossible to film in an actual storm of this magnitude. They work with the film, not dominating it or causing people to pay more attention to the handy work than to the story.A special comment must be made on the sound design of this film, which is totally superb. The musical score is well-defined, with chords of heavy bass and strings that wrap well into the surround channels. When the storm hits, there is a constant rumbling from the .1 LFE channel that delivers room-shaking bass, as well as surround sound that is sure to please.The cast works incredibly well with the story, bringing genuine life to each character. George Clooney is fantastic in his role as captain Billy Tyne, the man who nevers gives up when the chances are slim and the luck is down.

THE PERFECT STORM flounders (or should it be founders?) and languishes between being an outstanding disaster epic and a sappy, contrived, sophomoric bowl of melodramatic mush.  I'm convinced Diane Lane and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio cry more tears than all the waters of the Flemish Cap (and I added to the water table myself while tearfully pleading with the film to stop going back to the other forced silly subplots; the action is on the darn boat).  And I can only summarize Mark Wahlberg's performance with one ambivalent sigh.  When this flick is bad, it's really bad. . .But when it's good, it's an adrenaline rush on 'roids.  (My daily quota of R's has now been reached.)  Based (very, very loosely) on the true mishap of fishing boat 'Andrea Gail', walloped on the high seas by a massive storm of once-a-millennium proportions, THE PERFECT STORM is, when it's hitting on all disaster cylinders, one grand white-knuckler.  The CGIs of an angry sea are mesmerizing, and the performances of the crew aptly save this DVD from becoming an instant beverage coaster.  While George Clooney as stubborn Captain Billy Tyne is adequate, the real heroes of this film are the cast dudes who play the crew, including John C. Reilly, William Fichtner, and John Hawkes.

As technically informative as the book may be, however, it would have translated into a &quot;Nova&quot;-type documentary film rather than a &quot;movie&quot; had the film producers stuck faithfully to the contents of Junger's text.Instead, producer Gail Katz and director Wolfgang Peterson (who also directed such classics as *Das Boot*) have taken the hoary Gloucestermen-gamble-and-lose theme and turned it into a spectacular action film complete with some of the finest computer-generated special effects that have appeared on the big screen in many a year.  Some of the dialog and thematic material is predictable, and yes, unabashedly &quot;Hollywood,&quot; but so what?  The end product is extremely well-crafted, technically breathtaking, and thoroughly absorbing.  The film is worth seeing just for the computer-created storm effects, but on top of this, the acting, direction, and editing are all first-rate.After all, don't most of us go to the movie theater with a willingness to surrender to a few cliches, as long as these are presented in a form that is powerful and entertaining?

But honestly, men don't usually talk this way, especially fisherman!  The dialogue had no sense of reality--it sounded straight from Hollywood.  Of course, had the movie spent the first half on taciturn fishermen, it would really have been a loser, but still.  The dialogue at the end was troubling, where rather than casting recriminations at one another for making a foolish choice based on greed, the young guy... tells the captain they HAD to try. I was further bothered by the claim that it was based on a true story.  Well, the boat actually disappeared with all hands, but pretty much everything else is speculation, and some of it fairly nonsensical.  (Climbing up rigging that is slamming back and forth in a hurricane without a safety rope, but with a blowtorch ON!  Yeah, sure...) Special effects are terrific, true, and lots of the action is gripping; but this movie would be much better in a large screen theatre than at home.  There is a good side story about a Coast Guard rescue helicopter than I found more interesting than the main plot line.  Although I enjoyed the movie, I honestly can't imagine anyone wanting to see it twice, unless they really thrill to seeing Clooney and Wahlberg getting water thrown in their faces...maybe it will help you visualise being in the shower with them.  The real question about purchasing this movie is: Do you really want to spend [the] bucks for great computer-generated waves?  Oh yeah, the swordfish are very convincing, too.Now for a helpful hint, so that you can vote that this is a helpful review:  If you are ever fishing and pull up a large shark; or if you are ever near someone who does, NEVER stick your foot in the shark's mouth.

This is a primary reason to see this movie, with a story woven around George Clooney and crew as a perk. I would recommend anyone who has interest in the sea, commercial fishing, or coast guard rescues, to read the book by Sebastian Junger. The book is much better than the movie, and essential reading.I would also recommend reading everything published by Linda Greenlaw, a beautiful, intelligent little fireplug from Isle Au Haut, Maine. She was the Captain of the Hannah Boden, which was the sister ship to the doomed Andrea Gail of Perfect Storm fame. I've been fortunate enough to meet her three times at book-signings and love her writing. Start with her book ""The Hungry Ocean"" That's right! The story of the Perfect Storm intends to recreate an actual event which took place, a little tid-bit which has escaped the emphasis of most reviews. I've even sailed into Gloucester harbor, visited the Crows Nest bar of movie fame, and gotten some personal stories of the event.Interestingly, I have friends who are commercial fishermen off of the Maine coast. I was curious about their take on the movie. Several of them had never seen the flick and didn't intend to. A couple saw it and reckoned that Hollywood didn't get the dangers of fishing right enough. A couple loved it. Mostly, they are probably too close to the truth of the Andrea Gail's events to find entertainment value here. My hat's off to commercial fishermen everywhere, a tough field which is getting tougher. But, as far as I'm concerned, regardless of flaws inherent in the movie, the fact that it deals with this subject matter makes it required viewing by anyone curious about the sea.It's a great story, augmented by the fact that it's true (except for the Hollywood over-amplification of reality). The weather patterns conspired to create a true monster, more frightning than the largest white shark, the goriest slasher film or inane boogie man movie. This won't stop most people from seeing this film in the same vein as the latest Jerry Bruckheimer feature. Could the movie have been done better? Certainly.

Obviously the movie can't cover all of these things, and I didn't expect it to.  Instead, they made the wise decision to stick mainly to the Andrea Gail and her crew.  However, the movie DID add a silly manufactured rivalry between two of the fisherman, a labored romantic sobplot, and lots of melodramatic music.

I had no interest in seeing the movie when it was in the theaters. Who on earth wants to watch a movie that is loosely (and I mean loosely) based on the Sebastian Junger novel? After seeing it on TNT, I found myself quite taken with the movie despite the flaws in the movie. Because I have a brother who at one time worked on a fishing boat in Alaska, he had pointed out to me in a conversation a long time ago that no fisherman could have gotten a fishing hook shoved through his hand like John C. Reily's character did in the movie. Then again this is Hollywood and this is a movie that is loosely based on the tragic events of the Andrea Gail. I am not exactly a fan of George Clooney but I thought he did a pretty decent job of acting here as Capt. William Tyne. I did however really enjoy Mark Wahlberg's performances as Bobby Shatford and Diane Lane as his long-suffering girlfriend Chris. My only beef with Wahlberg was that the real Bobby was 40 years old when he perished. As good as Wahlberg was in the role, I thought the role of Bobby should have gone to a slightly older actor. Yeah sure the film is pretty much fictional than reality. The only things that Wolfgang Petersen got right was the characters' names, the Andrea Gail, and the fact that the crew of the Andrea Gail perished. The special effects are quite cheesy to say the very least, especially in the final scenes of the Andrea Gail. I don't know what is worse, computer generated special effects or claymation like in ""The Clash of the Titans"". I thought it was pointless of including the rescue of the sailboat and its small crew. It may have been in the book but I just didn't see in any point of having it in the movie. But for all its flaws (which there are plenty), I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Perfect Storm"".

I was transfixed watching this film, as real events unfolded out on the Gulf ... for the third time in one month ...in Florida.  Although this film starts slowly, once the fishermen are assembled  and out to sea... the action is non-stop and gut-wrenching. The entire film is powerful and suspense-filled. Overall, a true depiction of how serene waters can suddenly become life-threatening ...As the men innocently cast their nets, and work to haul in their catch of swordfish, the weatherman in Boston gives the viewer a satellite view of three storms that will likely converge exactly where Capt. Tyne and the fishermen are headed. Meanwhile in Gloucester Massachusetts, the families and friends are huddled at the corner bar ...watching the television that seems to confirm their worst fears about the lives of their loved ones. As they watch and hear of the news about the storm, they pray  for the safe return of the fishermen, wondering ...The cinematography of the rescue attempts are superb as is the filming of the Andrea Gail attempting to overcome the perils of the storm. Although Capt. Tyne appears a tad fool-hardy, the Coastguard who comes to their rescue and the fishermen themselves are depicted as men of courage and valor, which they truly were. The  fate of the swordfishermen seems inevitable.

There really is a limit to the length of time an audience will be interested in seeing gallons of water swooshing around in a boat.  The scriptwriters have desperately thrown in lots of second-rate plot lines to sustain our interest -- the two fishermen who hate each other because one slept with the other's now divorced wife, the couple who are determined to commit to each other for the long term etc etc -- but it's nothing like enough.  In fact, even the writers realised that the central plot was too weak, and so had to chuck in a completely separate yarn about a Bermuda-bound yacht that also gets into trouble.This film is a disaster movie.  Hiring a couple of big-name actors to draw in the audience is frankly a swindle.If, like me, you don't get out to the cinema much and have to wait for the DVD, just don't bother with this one.

Second, the story of a Henry Shackleton like captain.  Third, the natural castrophe known by meterologies as the storm of the century.The producer Gail Katz and director Wolfgang Peterson  selected a great cast:George ClooneyMark WahlbergWilliam FichtnerBob GuntonJohn ReillyAllen PayneJohn HawkesMary Elizabeth MastrantonioKaren AllenEconomic pressure revealed some of the harsh realities about the fishing business mainly the oceans have been overfished.  Fishing yield was down caused from over fishing, smaller fish sizes, and better scanning technology preventing fish to reach maturity and reproduction.  The cost of the ships, men, and banks increased the pressure on the captain to make a large fishing score.  The captain knew a place where there would be fish.  It was a well kept secret.  Willing to venture into more remote channels the captain recruited his team of six.Was the captain acting irrationally?  History protrays him as being heroic.  If viewed as the Henry Shackleton of the Altantic, he was a hero.  Willing to endure the buffets of the storm, smartly navigate his ship against the bitter cold wall so water, and rally and fighting his men against mutiny; the captain rational was unquestionable.  The payoff in captured tuna presented a stronger temptation then returning to safety.  The odds seemed to be against the captain.  This creating a very interesting and compelling tension through the movie. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was the voice of reason.  She was largely ignored and viewed as the challenge to be proven wrong.The meterological facts causing the storm of the century could be a movie in itself.  Computer models detected the probability of two jet streams colliding.  The effect was the storm of the century: thousands of tornado, incredible lighting storms, hurricane winds, and massive flooding.  Storm warnings indicated one of the most massive storms in recorded history.  Documentaries of the storm show the wide spread range of destruction.  We learned how powerful mother nature could be.In short, I liked the movie.

The movie's characters are actually underdeveloped and while they're out on the ship they don't seem extremely likeable and to tell you the truth, they look a bit unprofessional out on the boat. I don't know if this is due to bad acting or bad writing, but it seems that way and it has effected relatives of the natural disaster to go very far so obviously The Perfect Storm is definitely not a perfect puppy. The film can also be a bit cheesy and it takes too long to get to the damn storm. Lets see some special effects, already! However, when the characters really get into the storm the audience gets just as terrified as the people must have been on the Andrea Gail. The CGI special effects are the most convincing of 2000 and I was amazed at how realistic the storm was.

Upon reaching the cap, Billy and his crew find the fishing plentiful, but they are forced to cut their trip short when the ice making machine which is used to keep the fish cold breaks.  Reports of a developing storm are received and the Andrea Gail decides to head for home.  The storm, which was spawned by a convergance of multiple weather fronts, shows its fury to the Andrea Gail.

First of all, the fate of the seamen aboard the boat is shown in the first few minutes of the movie.  Looking at a list of people who have died at sea is a pretty big hint of what your in for.  So now you already know the ending.  Quite frankly, I would have rather watched Titanic.  At least that film had substance...a story line, interesting characters that you grow to know and care about... AND they knew how to use life preservers!The Perfect Storm was about a selfish guy who had no life but to fish.  He practically forced his team of seamen to be &quot;men&quot; and leave their loved ones only to meet their doom.  Not my idea of a blockbuster film by any means.  On top of the story, you don't really get to know the characters well enough to really care what happens to them.  Also during the second half of the movie, there is a rescue of some people on board a small sailboat.  Who are they??  And why does their rescue take up a half hour of the movie?... A half hour that could have been used to help develop the main characters!  The computer effects were like the movie... overboard in a big way.  Some were impressive, but too much can be, well, too much.  You get to the point where scenes don't look realistic at all.  And then there is the acting... oh boy.  Lane and Clooney went overboard before the storm ever hit.I'm curious to know what made this particular story (true as it may be) so intriguing that it needed to be made into a movie.

527344,AF7YB1DXSGMLY,B00003CXJC,Jonathon Rehlander,"[2, 2]","If you want to take this film at face value, the criticism that has followed it has merit.  The characters aren't developed as well as they  could have been, and the compelling story has the taint of being  transformed into a summer event film.  The director, Wolfgang Peterson, had  a much better film in Das Boot than this one, which was packaged for action  and incredible special effects.  However, the critics who put down the film  for being partially based on theorhetical occurrences are offbase.  While  no one can know what really happened to the crew of the Andrea Gail, the  events portrayed in the film are not terribly unusual for people in this  line of work, and are indicative of what could very well have been the case  on the fateful voyage.On the positive side, the cast is well chosen,  with George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, and Diane Lane leading the group.  They  take what there is to glean from the script and do a fine job of making  these characters into people that you do care about by the end of the film.  The cast spent months in the town where the characters are based, learning  from the families and the friends they had there.  This comes through in  the performances, all the way to the touching end of the film.What  impressed me most of all, in addition to this film being made at all, is  how they managed to capture the every day heroism of the men and women who  make their living doing things that most of us never think about in  situations so hazardous that even the bravest of us would be daunted by.  There are many careers that could be shown in film--beyond the cops and  detectives who inhabit the bulk of them--that are done by people who are  otherwise unremarkable.  The attraction of this film is showing normal  people caught in extraordinary circumstances, and how the crew and their  families deal with it.Beyond this, the film's effects are spectacular  without taking away from the story.  While the viewer watches The Perfect  Storm, they are impressed by the imagery without forgetting that these are  real people.  There are other films that will be better, but this one is  unforgettable in its own way.",4,The Usually Unsung Heroes,968457600,"09 9, 2000",2000,2164,"['want', 'take', 'film', 'face', 'value', 'criticism', 'followed', 'merit', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'developed', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'compelling', 'story', 'taint', 'being', 'transformed', 'summer', 'event', 'film', 'director', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Das', 'Boot', 'one', 'was', 'packaged', 'action', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'However', 'critics', 'who', 'put', 'down', 'film', 'being', 'partially', 'based', 'theorhetical', 'occurrences', 'are', 'offbase', 'one', 'can', 'know', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'crew', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'events', 'portrayed', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'unusual', 'people', 'line', 'work', 'are', 'indicative', 'what', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'case', 'fateful', 'voyage.On', 'positive', 'side', 'cast', 'well', 'chosen', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'leading', 'group', 'take', 'what', 'glean', 'script', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'making', 'characters', 'people', 'do', 'care', 'end', 'film', 'cast', 'spent', 'months', 'town', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'based', 'learning', 'families', 'friends', 'had', 'there', 'performances', 'way', 'touching', 'end', 'film.What', 'impressed', 'most', 'addition', 'film', 'being', 'made', 'how', 'managed', 'capture', 'day', 'heroism', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'make', 'living', 'doing', 'things', 'most', 'never', 'think', 'situations', 'so', 'hazardous', 'even', 'bravest', 'would', 'be', 'daunted', 'are', 'many', 'careers', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'film', 'cops', 'detectives', 'who', 'inhabit', 'bulk', 'are', 'done', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'otherwise', 'unremarkable', 'attraction', 'film', 'showing', 'normal', 'people', 'caught', 'extraordinary', 'circumstances', 'how', 'crew', 'families', 'deal', 'it.Beyond', 'film', 'effects', 'are', 'spectacular', 'taking', 'away', 'story', 'viewer', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'are', 'impressed', 'imagery', 'forgetting', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'are', 'other', 'films', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'one', 'unforgettable', 'own', 'way']",N/A

That movie sticks to you, scares the hooey outta ya, makes you think... but this... this &quot;Storm&quot; this thing... this hideousness.. total lack of subtlety.. makes a guy wanna barf.I didn't read the book, but of course I knew what was going to happen and being from Boston and all there was a certain allure to this film, the local angle and what-not, but what a gigantic let-down! Here's my experience of the movie in an nutshell.. you can send me your heartfelt thanks for saving you the... rental charge:1. Some fishing guy gets his pride all hurt and has to go out to prove himself a tough fishing guy in front of his crew and a competing lady fishing guy.2. You don't know anyone's name on the boat, even a good hour into the film. You're saying to yourself, &quot;Is that guy Murph or Eddie? Is there even an Eddie in this film? Does anyone want me to go get popcorn?&quot;4. In line getting popcorn you find other movie patrons each with a fixed stare, a sense of impending doom. It's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Snack Bar&quot; as the undead who have been watching this film seek respite from it by standing in line as long as possible. I give everyone behind me &quot;cuts&quot; and stare at the Dove Bar poster behind the counter. Twenty minutes pass.5. I return with popcorn and ask my date, &quot;What happened?&quot; She says, &quot;The storm is coming.&quot; I ask, &quot;The fat guy. Is his name Dougie?&quot; No reply.6. The big wave from the movie poster comes and kills everyone. I think I hear some muted cheering behind me. I sigh in relief. The fat guy says, &quot;This is going to be hard on my boy.&quot; Is that what you'd say if you were in frigid salt-water with a boat on top of you? I think a stream of expletives or frantic praying to the deity of your choice is more apropos. I mean, really... What did he expect Micky (or Dougie or whatever) to say? &quot;Yeah, I'll let your son know you said that after I swim back to shore. See ya.&quot; I am dying for another box of popcorn, another peek at the Dove Bar poster7. Wolfgang Petersen, in a move I believe inspired by custom airbrush paintings on the sides of many 1970's cargo vans, superimposes the angelic softly-focused visage of Wahlberg's girlfriend's face on a far and wide shot of Wahlberg floating quietly in the north Atlantic, so much cinematic flotsam. The voice-over reads some corny letter he wrote to the girlfriend.

527346,A1QKCTSWTOOFRK,B00003CXJC,Josh Leman,"[1, 1]","Really, this movie isn't quite as bad as all the one-star reviewers would have you believe.  Once the storm gets going it's actually a pretty pretty riveting and exciting film.  The problem is that it takes like an hour and a half for the storm to get going, and for all that time we have to sit through dull, unrealistic, shallow character development and James Horner's gloopy, overused music score.  It's really hard to like the first half of this movie, which manages to misuse such brilliant performers as Mark Wahlberg and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (so good in another aquatic adventure film, The Abyss) with so much sentimental, unbelievable dialogue.  Once the fishermen go out to sea, we can guess that basically everything going on is purely fiction, and it's not hard to make that assumption because everything that goes on is so rigidly cinematic and it's almost like the characters know they're in a summer blockbuster movie.  But let's be honest: we're here for the storm, not the characters, and the film certainly delivers one hell of a storm.  The last half hour or so is a jolting rollercoaster ride that leaves you exhausted and exhilarated, and that's why most people go to the movies on summer Saturday afternoons.  The film did exactly what it was meant to, which is cram people into theatres on the weekend.  Owning the film on video or DVD is a different matter, though.  Even if you're impressed by the storm, as I was, you still get the idea that the film simply will not hold up under close scrutiny or repeated viewings.

If the answer to both of those questions is `yes', then The Perfect Storm is the ideal film for you. However, if you go to a movie for storyline and Oscar-potential all-around then it maybe not be quite the movie to suit your night out. Billy Tyne (George Clooney) is a sword-fishing-boat captain out of Gloucester, highly competitive and stung by a string of poor outings. His crew is hardly back in port when he tells them he's going out again, even though it's October and the weather can turn ugly. Five join him: the young Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), newly in love; Murph (John C. Reilly), a devoted father recently divorced; Sully (William Fichtner), a guy Murph despises; Bugsy (John Hawkes), who's finally met a woman who likes him; and Alfred (Allen Payne), a quiet Jamaican. They catch little, so they sail east, with Tyne ignoring storm warnings behind him. Finally, the fish bite, but the ice machine fails. Should they head home through the storm of the century, or wait it out and lose their catch? Fearful, the women wait.And they wait too long. The movie drags on a little too much, there are far too many clich&eacute;'s in the storyline, and the first half is so ... boring. But, in the second half, things pick up and the film starts to look more promising. George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg are fine leads, but they were much better in Three Kings, while John C. Reilly couldn't top his performance in Magnolia if he tried. Wolfgang Petersen's direction is focused and plausible, but the wannabe-emotion in the script can sometimes be laughable. However, the sound is furious and the editing is stunning, so there is enough eye-canding to sustain the running time.Overall, The Perfect Storm is a fine film. It's just not as good as Petersen promised, which is a lot more than we got. Still, it is watchable and exciting, and recommended for a stormy day, kind of like the one in this film. But, those days don't come along very often.",3,"Average enough, but could've been improved.",984787200,"03 17, 2001",2001,2088,"['Perfect', 'StormScore', '60/100Are', 'complete', 'sucker', 'weather', 'porn', 'Do', 'big', 'waves', 'movies', 'earn', 'huge', 'amounts', 'money', 'answer', 'questions', 'yes', 'then', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'ideal', 'film', 'However', 'go', 'movie', 'storyline', 'Oscar-potential', 'all-around', 'then', 'maybe', 'not', 'be', 'quite', 'movie', 'suit', 'night', 'out', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'George', 'Clooney', 'sword-fishing-boat', 'captain', 'Gloucester', 'highly', 'competitive', 'stung', 'string', 'poor', 'outings', 'crew', 'hardly', 'back', 'port', 'when', 'going', 'out', 'again', 'even', 'October', 'weather', 'can', 'turn', 'ugly', 'Five', 'join', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'newly', 'love', 'Murph', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'devoted', 'father', 'recently', 'divorced', 'Sully', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'guy', 'Murph', 'Bugsy', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'finally', 'met', 'woman', 'who', 'Alfred', 'Allen', 'Payne', 'quiet', 'Jamaican', 'catch', 'little', 'sail', 'east', 'Tyne', 'ignoring', 'storm', 'warnings', 'Finally', 'fish', 'bite', 'ice', 'machine', 'fails', 'Should', 'head', 'home', 'storm', 'century', 'wait', 'out', 'lose', 'catch', 'Fearful', 'women', 'wait.And', 'wait', 'too', 'long', 'movie', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', 'storyline', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'boring', 'second', 'half', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'film', 'look', 'more', 'promising', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'are', 'fine', 'leads', 'were', 'much', 'better', 'Three', 'Kings', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'could', ""n't"", 'top', 'performance', 'Magnolia', 'tried', 'Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'direction', 'focused', 'plausible', 'wannabe-emotion', 'script', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'laughable', 'However', 'sound', 'furious', 'editing', 'stunning', 'enough', 'eye-canding', 'sustain', 'running', 'time.Overall', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'fine', 'film', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Petersen', 'promised', 'lot', 'more', 'got', 'Still', 'watchable', 'exciting', 'recommended', 'stormy', 'day', 'kind', 'one', 'film', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'along', 'very', 'often']",N/A

After a rough and skimpy fishing season, the crew decides to make one last trip to sea. They hope to make a giant score and make up for their bad luck. Far out into almost uncharted fishing waters, they make a mammoth haul. Just as they are starting to celebrate, they hear the bad news. A hurricane is bearing down on them. They decide to gun it straight through the storm and save their haul before it spoils. With their families anxiously watching and waiting, they fight with all they have to return home. The outcome is legendary and heartbreaking.I have never liked George Clooney. This is the only film I've ever seen him in that I liked. He actually does a great job. Mark Wahlberg also plays a great role. This movie has great special effects, acting, and a high level of intensity & sentimentality. Whether you are a fisherman or not, this movie will bring a tear to your eye, and remind you not to take life for granted. The sea is the one thing on our planet that we will probably never conquer.

I went to see this with absolutely NO idea of the story, having never read Junger's book.Now that all the people who expected an intelligent, non-biased review have run away shaking their heads, let me explain.I took my dad to see this for his birthday - in actuality, i was going to see Space Cowboys. I cannot say how glad I am that we saw this instead.The movie begins by introducing us to the fishermen of the Andrea Gail, their motives for going out again two days after a disappointing run, as well as their families. This way, we care about who they are as well as who they leave behind - and the points of view both of the men and their lovers and children. The human scenes are both touching and intriguing, as the sheer fact that they are included tells us that something is not going to go right.Of course not. This is, after all, the Perfect Storm. Three monstrous hurricanes forming together to create 100ft waves, gale winds, and rubber shark attacks.:) By the way, for those scared of blood, the shark chews up Mark Wahlberg's leg - eep.Actually, the special effects were very well done, including the intercut scenes of a stranded sailing yacht - but this sequence served no place in the movie except to make it a little too long. Water get numbing after awhile. Even when you're watching a talented crew, not to mention George Clooney, swim - hey, if I wanted to see gymnastics, I'd watch the Olympics.But I don't mean to be cruel. This WAS good, much better than i expected, and it resonated with me as I'm from Maine. Those of us who live near the ocean know what it can do, as well as what it can undo, and we learn to treat it with respect. That is why it's such a treat when an intelligent film depicting the people who work in tandem with this natural force comes along - you know what they mean.My only big problem is the graphic scenes - no, don't worry, though I'm sure the female contingent isn't &quot;worrying&quot; at that remark, with certain of this cast- in which the dead swordfish are depicted decapitated. However, as it is a fishing boat - you might as well expect that.Still, go see it. For whatever reason. Good male/female film: if the girls don't care that much for the big overblown ocean rescues, they may care about other aspects. ;) The guys - well, disasters are disasters.Have fun.

This riveting story is based on a novel called The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea by Sebastian Junger.  Wolfgang Peterson directs, the special effects are superb, the casting is good.  I cannot stress the realism of the effects, or the care and dedication that went into honoring the men of the fishing town of Gloucester, where the movie was filmed.George Clooney stars as swordfishing boat Andrea Gail captain Billy Tine, who is leading a crew of five men in a late-season, last-ditch effort to get a good catch in what was a bad season for him.  Mark Walbergh stars as his first mate Bobby Shatford, a young fisherman torn between his new love (Diane Lane) and the open sea.  The incomparable John C. Reilly plays a gruff sailor.  Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio plays a female fishing boat captain.The DVD has fascinating extras that lend depth to the film.  Once you see the extras, you will not see the movie in the same light.  The commentary with book author Junger is so riveting that I watched the whole thing in complete fascination.  The depth of research Junger did for the book, the paranormal experiences of family of the crew and Junger himself, the recognition the book received, are so vivid and comprehensive, and will touch your heart.  There is an HBO special preview, with comments from Clooney, Walbergh, and friends and family of the crew of the Andrea Gail.

Its fate is not a mystery and the tale of these men's demise is no surprise - but their journey, kinship and determination makes their lives meaningful and poignant. Simply put, three storm-fronts came clashing together back in 1991 in a way that no storm ever has in the history of recorded history.The story is about these six men and the people their lives touched. The captain played by George Clooney and his shipmates played by Mark Wahlberg (Planet of The Apes remake, Boogie Nights), William Fichtner (Armageddon, Contact, Pearl Harbor), Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Ace Ventura: When Natures Calls), John C. Reilly (The new Chicago feature, Magnolia, Boogie Nights), Allen Payne (New Jack City, Vampire In Brooklyn) and John Hawkes (Rush Hour, Scary Movie). Set out a last desperate run to get some fish, save their reputations and make some money before the fishing season is over. They all give wonderful performances.There are also incredible performances give by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (The Abyss, Robin Hood: Prince Of The Stars) as a fellow ship captain and the only female fishing ship captain, Diane Lane (Rumble Fish, Chaplin) as the perfect sensitive girlfriend of Mark Wahlberg and Karen Allen (Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Starman) as a fellow boat rider caught in the heart of `The Perfect Storm'.Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Air Force One, Outbreak, In The Line Of Fire) this film is artistically done and respectful of the lives and community these events took place in. Over 10,000 people were lost to the seas over 400 years. The visual effects are incredible and amazing and James Horner's score is very heartfelt and powerful. He did compliment this mightier monster they called `The Perfect Storm'.

The cast did a horrible job, and the script was so corny i had to leave the theater.  The DVD (a friend showed me, I didn't buy it) is just as bad, with the same horrible movie, and a bunch of features that are the same as on any other DVD.  There is just some lousy behind-the-scenes stuff that you would see on any other DVD, like the cameras rolling across a cart following the cast or something, and nothing major about how the wave effects were made.As for that, the movie itself is just bad.  6 fishermen set out from a port in Maine, and go very far out to sea looking for the big catch.  When they finally get it, they start back, only to find out a huge hurricane is in their path.  They go anyway, and it turns out that the ending sucks almost as badly as the movie itself.  This is really just a sappy love story involving fish.  If another movie like this ever comes out I'll go paranoid.  I'll just put it the simple way:  This is the worst movie to come out in the past 10 years and it should have never made it to video, let alone DVD.Then again, the effects in this movie are amazing, which is why I gave it 2 stars.  I don't know how they did it, but the special effects made the movie better.  Considering how bad this movie is to begin with, the effects guy should have gotten an Oscar for those waves.  Other than the effects, this movie starts a snore war everytime you watch it.  If you like sappy romantic dramas, then get this.

We do not know what actually happened on board, and which of the subplots and events that were added in to brighten up what was an otherwise sad story. The Andrea Gail sets out for a late-season fishing voyage right before a number of meteorological events trigger one of the largest storms in history on the Eastern Seaboard. We get to see many events that occurred including the perils of a yacht, a Coast Guard helicopter crew, and the fishermen on the Andrea Gail.I feel they captured the town and fishermen. The time at the beginning of the movie is required so that you can see why the men were willing to take risk going out so late in the season to fish again. I enjoyed the little look into New England fishery.The boat, the men and the action on the high seas are great to watch. The storm effects (CGI I'm sure) were also very cool.

I was astonished at the scene (obviously made-up to create empathy for our silly sailors) where one man gets dragged overboard and two other hard-drinkin', hard-SMOKING guys dive right in after him and swim about 100 yards UNDERWATER in a HURRICANE, FIND HIM, grab the poor sap, and then CATCH UP to the boat. Uh-huh, yeah, OK. THAT'S what kind of movie ya got here, folks. (I also want to know the secret of how they managed to light those cigarettes in a hurricane, while we're at it.) Let's not even get into the total absence of life vests, use of transponders, or why the poor TV weather-guy is made to look like a villain. ALL of the characters were of the flimsiest cardboard (except George Clooney, poor guy, who simply can NOT be ANYbody other than George Clooney: dress him up in surgical scrubs, a sailor suit, desert camo fatigues - same George.)The James Horner soundtrack suffers from extreme emotional bloat - but the RANGE of emotions is from drippy to gooey to simply sacharine.

The film tries to breathe life into these men, but it fails miserably.  We just don't know, nor do we really care about those poor men as they embark on their final trip.  The story tosses in ever cliche along the way for no reason other than make this film run for 142 minutes.  Whether or not all the events contained in this film actually happend is unimportant, the story of this film, to recreate the tragedy of the Andrea Gail and its crew doesn't need the absurd subplot concerning three morons lost at sea and the attempts to rescue them.  This takes a good 40 minutes of the story and whenever the story of the Andrea Gail gets really intese, we cut away to the laughable rescue mission plot with characters so paper thin they vanish when they turn sideways.  Why should we even care about this, we don't know these people, their story never really crosses with the Andrea Gail's so the point is questionable.  Another subplot, concerning the dopey weatherman who realizes that three storms are converging is unnecessary and silly.  The acting hammy and the dialogue hilariously bad.  With all of that garbage removed from the film, The Perfect Storm would've turned out to be more of a winner.  At 100 minutes instead of 142, things would've been more intense and the tragic climax would've gotten to more audiences.  As the film stands, at the finish, it leaves one too exhausted and tired to fully care about what has happened.  The cast is excellent and this film is wonderfully directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the scenes at sea are intense and exciting, but many are unnecessary.  This film may have been a blockbuster this summer, but I can't understand why exactly, it's just another case of a good movie lurking beneath all the Hollywood bull.

527377,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXJC,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","I may be partial to A Perfect Storm because I have always had an affinity with the sea. I have lived by or near an ocean on three occasions, and these may have been the happiest times of my life. This attraction is shared by many. It is hard to explain because, in truth, the seaside is about the most dangerous place on earth. Yet the love affair never dims. I say all this by way of explaining why the characters in The Perfect Storm don't seriously consider finding a safer and more predictable way of making a living than being deep sea fishermen. It really is in their blood to live this way.The movie is based on a marvelous nonfiction book by Sebastian Junger. While the film adaptation does not live up to the book, a valiant attempt has been made. Sometimes I do not think the movies are always capable of conjuring up images as fertile as those we can make inside our heads.In the fall of 1991, a terrible storm occurred along the New England coast. It was the improbable meeting of a fierce cold front out of Canada and a hurricane blowing in from the Atlantic. In the town of Glouster, MA, Captain Billy Tyne [George Clooney] has decided to go out on one more fishing expedition just two days after coming back from his last one. He is determined to break a streak of bad luck. His crew reluctantly agrees to go, though they would much prefer more shore leave. Especially distraught is Christina [Diane Lane], the girlfriend of crew member Bobby Shatford [Mark Wahlberg]. The voyage starts out well enough, marred only by fights between Murph and Sully [John C. Reilly and William Fitchner]. After a couple of weeks, the boat is full of swordfish. It's time to head back. The route back lies directly in the path of the storm.Director Wolfgang Petersen, best know for Air Force One and In the Line of Fire, does a great job, managing to let the story of these men and the people who love them survive a ton of CGI effects. These effects are awesome. Some of them are ominously beautiful, looking like masterful portraits of the sea come to life. Others seem surreal, but then there is something other worldly about eighty foot waves, which did, in fact, occur in this storm.The Perfect Storm is a first-rate disaster epic.INSIDE SHOTS: As in so many movies we see today, The Perfect Storm is at least fifty percent computer generated image [CGI] effects. Many of them are obvious. The storm is not real, nor are the boats rolling around in it. But here, even the sky is often not real. My favorite trick is in the scene in which George Clooney is dangling from a pole at the height of the storm. That's not George you see. It's not even a stuntman.

Lebow,"[3, 5]","** Spoiler Alert! **By the time most people got to the theater to see this film, or rented it, they already knew the ship and its crew would be dead in less than two hours.Surprisingly, this does not diminish from the film's power. Even on second or third viewing, the film never delivers a moment that is false, maudlin, or sentimental. The plot is not what keeps people engaged during this film. It is the issue. How do people face death?In this film, the people are the captain and crew of the boat. They know commercial fishing is a difficult and dangerous job, even when the weather is good. The weather is not good. The men need the money. They go out even though they know they will meet a storm. They are used to risking their lives every day.The storm turns into a hurricane that traps the men, and kills them. They struggle to save their own lives. They fail. When they are neck deep in water in a compartment of the overturned boat, they face death squarely. They talk, briefly, and unsentimentally, about things they will not be able to do, people they will miss. The stark, plainness of the acting achieves a powerful effect.At the beginning of the film, the viewer meets the crew. On repeated viewings, the film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial. The men are solid, working people. There is no sappy foreshadowing.The director deserves kudos for maintaining iron-fisted control of a vehicle that could have been campy.The viewer will learn a lot about meteorology. The special effects are indistinguishable from live action.All the actors, including George Clooney, maintain a stoic engagement with life, and they struggle to live, with no appeal to our pity, until they are dead.The Perfect Storm is more than a film.

Director Wolfgang Petersen commandeers a wonderful cast, and the special effects are stupendous.  What made this movie work so much for me wasn't the leading roles of George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg or John C. Reilly, although they were just fine.  It's the people in secondary roles, particularly the women, who made such an impact on me.  Diane Lane is perfect as Christina, Mark's woman who wants to start a new life with him; even if her accent isn't quite up to par, her immersion in the role is great.  Rusty Schwimmer as Irene, the overweight single mother who finds herself intrigued with Bugsy (John Hawke, in an outstanding performance) doesn't have a lot of screen time, but she commands it when she does.  So does Janet Wright as Mark's momma, Edith.  Wright's performance was right on key in both her love for her son and the acceptance of Diane into her family.  Likewise, Merle Kennedy's role as John Reilly's ex-wife requires little screen time or dialogue, but her presence is powerfully felt.  William Frichtner's painful presence as Reilly's nemesis is especially powerful as he saves Reilly's life and becomes more of a friend.  Christopher McDonald as the metereologist who practically explodes in excitement with the birth of the perfect storm adds a strange tint of irony and sadness.

I suppose if I hadn't read the book I wouldn't have been bothered by all the fictional material, but even so, there were just too many flaws in what could have been a great movie.The dialogue, for one. It's just full of hackneyed cliches (""It's the money, isn't it? It's always about the money!"") and forced exposition (""and you, Linda Greenlaw, the only woman swordfish boat captain in Gloucester..."") that makes you wonder if they couldn't perhaps have spent some of that special effects budget on the script. Some of the casting is a bit much as well; somehow we're supposed to believe that a fishing town is full of anorextic actresses with high cheeckbones and perfect skin and hair. If the real Linda Greenlaw had Karen Allen's physique she wouldn't be able to scoop goldfish out of a tank at the local pet store, let alone hauling lobster traps over the transom of her boat.Even so, it's a thrilling movie, with incredible drama- the rescue at sea of a party of sailors, the loss of the Coast Guard helicopter- and the scenes of swordfishing on the deck of the Andrea Gail are startlingly realistic.

527385,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00003CXJC,Mike,"[0, 1]","&quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (2000)The Perfect Storm scored a lot of attention with people all-round. Critics might've went to see it for review purposes and to check out the awesome cast. Grandparents and senior citizens might've checked it out for the true story buzz. Teenagers would've went to see it because of the ""hot guys"" and incredible special effects. Because of all the great aspects of the film attracting viewers from all round, this became one of the most anticipated movies of 2000, so I was expecting to be entertained through the film. I was rewarded with some greatly tense and thoroughly entertaining sequences, but unfortunately The Perfect Storm has flaws that cannot be overlooked.For example, the families of those who died out there on the sea are actually trying to sue the film company for their horrid character depiction. I can see why. The characters in The Perfect Storm are usually extremely angry for no reason at all, or just fishing heaps. This is especially the case with George Clooney's character, who is supposed to be the `hero.' I don't know if this is due to bad character development or bad acting, but I know Clooney barely ever gives us a bad performance so it had to be something to do with the script. Fortunately, John C. Reilly's likeable screen family man is a saving grace in the script department. He's probably the only person I felt for out there on the ship.There are also heaps of corny lines, and by the time the storm gets on to the screen you might've already lost interest. I mean, the characters fish for about 40 minutes. After a while it's like, okay, I don't need lessons with putting my rod out, just get to the bloody storm we all came to see!Thankfully, the all-star cast, strong direction, booming and realistic sound effects and utterly incredible visuals save this movie. Clooney isn't particularly likeable as I said before, and this is not of his career highpoints. Mark Wahlberg is again the sensitive guy who gets into a lot of trouble. He is good in this movie, but Wahlberg, with such great talent, really needs to get some more range. Reilly is a natural, Diane Lane is quite impressive but not really emotional enough, and William Fichtner just does what he always does - pisses me off.Wolfgang Petersen really enjoyed making the movie and he wanted the storm to come across as terrifying, almost unbelievable (if it weren't for the `based on the true story' tagline I'm sure most audiences would be rolling their eyes and sighing), and damn amazing. Well, Wolfgang, you've certainly succeeded. Seeing these people trying to survive in a storm of tidal waves, CGI waters and lots of stomach churning boat flopping is the most creditable aspect of the movie. The storm is very well done and I have never seen anything quite like it. It is the huge strength of the movie and made it one of the most interesting, scary and nerve-wracking bunch of sequences I've ever seen on film.However, the movie still suffers from some goofs, silly lines and bad character development. That spots The Perfect Storm from being great and puts it down to a disappointing average experience that has a chance of staying with you after viewing.MY GRADE: B-",3,No justice for the characters but still watchable.,1018224000,"04 8, 2002",2002,3214,"['quot', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'quot', '2000', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'scored', 'lot', 'attention', 'people', 'all-round', 'Critics', 'might', ""'ve"", 'went', 'see', 'review', 'purposes', 'check', 'out', 'awesome', 'cast', 'Grandparents', 'senior', 'citizens', 'might', ""'ve"", 'checked', 'out', 'true', 'story', 'buzz', 'Teenagers', 'would', ""'ve"", 'went', 'see', 'hot', 'guys', 'incredible', 'special', 'effects', 'great', 'aspects', 'film', 'attracting', 'viewers', 'round', 'became', 'one', 'most', 'anticipated', 'movies', '2000', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'entertained', 'film', 'was', 'rewarded', 'greatly', 'tense', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'sequences', 'unfortunately', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'flaws', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked.For', 'example', 'families', 'who', 'died', 'out', 'there', 'sea', 'are', 'actually', 'trying', 'sue', 'film', 'company', 'horrid', 'character', 'depiction', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'characters', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'are', 'usually', 'extremely', 'angry', 'reason', 'just', 'fishing', 'heaps', 'especially', 'case', 'George', 'Clooney', 'character', 'who', 'supposed', 'be', 'hero', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'due', 'bad', 'character', 'development', 'bad', 'acting', 'know', 'Clooney', 'barely', 'ever', 'bad', 'performance', 'had', 'be', 'something', 'do', 'script', 'Fortunately', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'likeable', 'screen', 'family', 'man', 'saving', 'grace', 'script', 'department', 'probably', 'only', 'person', 'felt', 'there', 'ship.There', 'are', 'also', 'heaps', 'corny', 'lines', 'time', 'storm', 'screen', 'might', ""'ve"", 'already', 'lost', 'interest', 'mean', 'characters', 'fish', '40', 'minutes', 'okay', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'lessons', 'putting', 'rod', 'out', 'just', 'get', 'bloody', 'storm', 'came', 'see', 'Thankfully', 'all-star', 'cast', 'strong', 'direction', 'booming', 'realistic', 'sound', 'effects', 'utterly', 'incredible', 'visuals', 'save', 'movie', 'Clooney', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'likeable', 'said', 'not', 'career', 'highpoints', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'again', 'sensitive', 'guy', 'who', 'lot', 'trouble', 'good', 'movie', 'Wahlberg', 'such', 'great', 'talent', 'really', 'get', 'more', 'range', 'Reilly', 'natural', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'quite', 'impressive', 'not', 'really', 'emotional', 'enough', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'just', 'what', 'always', 'pisses', 'off.Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'making', 'movie', 'wanted', 'storm', 'come', 'terrifying', 'almost', 'unbelievable', 'were', ""n't"", 'based', 'true', 'story', 'tagline', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'audiences', 'would', 'be', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'sighing', 'damn', 'amazing', 'Well', 'Wolfgang', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'succeeded', 'Seeing', 'people', 'trying', 'survive', 'storm', 'tidal', 'waves', 'CGI', 'waters', 'lots', 'stomach', 'churning', 'boat', 'flopping', 'most', 'creditable', 'aspect', 'movie', 'storm', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'huge', 'strength', 'movie', 'made', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'scary', 'nerve-wracking', 'bunch', 'sequences', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film.However', 'movie', 'still', 'goofs', 'silly', 'lines', 'bad', 'character', 'development', 'spots', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'being', 'great', 'down', 'disappointing', 'average', 'experience', 'chance', 'staying', 'viewing.MY', 'GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

Yes, there was tension as a group of impovorished fisherman travel further than they would normally to find some fish to continue earning a livelihood. yes there was drama as on the way back from their fishing, their boat is caught up in the middle of a terrifying storm. But the storm is not as terrifiying as it could have been, and completely drowns out any intelligent conversation. Having said that, the first hour of the film deals with the introductions to the characters, and the conversations then are not particularly intelligent. The film fundementally falls down, becuase the events it portrays are so ordinary. Only the storm is special, everything else is run-of-the-mill. Its like you or me going out for the day, and getting caught up in a snow-storm, crashing the car, and getting killed. The crash would be the focal point in the film, the rest of it would just be boring. The acting does not help the cause; George Clooney doesn't come across as a rugged fisherman type, neither does Mark Walhberg - the ability to sport a beard is not the only qualification in playing someone from the great outdoors. In particular however, the love interests in the poor lives of these fishermen were portrayed terribly. The best (or worst) example of this was the large woman who met one of the fishermen in the pub during the film's opening, and basically told him where to go. At the end of the film when the deaths of our brave heroes are announced and the funnerals take place, you see the same woman unconvincingly weeping uncontrollably. Unneccesary and laughable emotion, but deemed worthy to try and boost the film.

Then comes The Perfect Storm, which shatters everything good about true stories.  The only thing that can be completely 100% percent true, about this movie is the storm and the people on the boat. If you watch through all the movie then you will understand what I am talking about. That is IF you can watch all of the movie. The perfect storm is all about special effects, and boy is there a lot. I just have one question. How long can you watch waves dip and toss a boat? The answer, not very.  The Perfect Storm I feel insults those who might have had to deal with this storm in real life. It is a trudgy mess of a movie that is an utterly depressing film to watch and even more depressing to sit through.  It isn't slow, for a 2 hour and 9 minute movie it gets right down to business, obviously whoever came up with the idea of the film was thinking &quot;Okay lets make a kick A%^ special effects movie, so we don't have to screw around with people talking.&quot; There is very little dialogue, and when there is someone talking, you can't here it.  Despite, its special effects extravaganza, The Perfect Storm is an absolutely useless movie, boring, and dumb. I just got completely fed up wit the storm and got tired of watching them fight the storm, which believe got old pretty dang quick.

527390,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,B00003CXJC,Mr. Cairene,"[9, 12]","They said it couldn't be done, but director Wolfgand Petersen has managed to make a sensational film out of a thoroughly mediocre script. Petersen's film is more of an exhilerating showcase for ILM's magnificant storm effects then a moving account of the real life events that took place off the coast of Nova Scotia in the fall of 1991. As a result the film's final scene with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, which I won't describe here, is more uncomforatble then moving. Given the fact these characters were based on real people, that last sentence may seem offensive, but the fault lies squarely with William Wittliff's one dimensional characterisations.The film opens with the fishermen returning home with their catch. Petersen works extra-hard to capture the flavors and accents of the small town of Gloucester,Mass. There are scenes in a local saloon where Springsteen's Hungry Heart plays and the fishermen are reunited with their lovers, mothers and ex-wives. But Petersen's attempts are thwarted by Wittliff's shallow writing. We are introduced to skipper Billy Tyne(George Clooney) who walks around in a flannel shirt, looking like a movie star and spouting lines like &quot;I am doing what I was made to do&quot;. Then there is Bobby Shafford(Mark Wahlberg) who is deeply in debt and deeply in love with Christina Cotter(Diane Lane). The rest of the Andria Gail's six man crew are Murph(John C.Reilly) who maintains a friendly relationship with his ex-wife, Sully(William Fichtner) who is made, by the screenwriter, to hate Murph and thus provide the film with some badly written scenes of tension and reconcilation before the storm arrives, Alfred Pierre(Alan Payne) a Jamican fisherman who remains entirely in the background and Bugsy(John Hawkes) who is the film's most endearing character and infact would seem like a screenwriter's idea of comic relief if he weren't a real person. Where some screenwriters manage to create real people out of thin air, Wittliff has taken real people and molded them into convenient stock characters.James Horner's score, which is a fine piece of music, is terribly used. If the film-makers intention was to present us with real people so we could care about their peril, why does Horner's orchestral score accompany them on a seemingly routine fishing trip. These six guys are heading out to sea to catch some fish, and Horner's music all but tells us, that they are infact destined to meet The Perfect Storm of the title. It gives the game away.Gradually, Petersen abandons his futile attempts at human drama, and shifts his attention to what is ultimately the real star of the film, that awe-inspiring and genuinely terrifying storm. There is a completely perfunctory cameo from Christopher McDonald as the meteoroligist who exists only to describe what a the &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; is, and frankly I would have preferred a narration over the opening credits doing just that. A parallel story line involving the rescue attempts of a sailboat called the Mistral exists only to tease the audience with the spectacle of the storm the crew of the Andrea Gail will soon encounter. But by that time ridiculous lines such as &quot;Its time to seperate the men from the boys&quot; and &quot;You're heading right into the heart of the monster&quot; have been uttered with straight faces, that the audience is forced into the criminal position of eagerly awaiting the dreaded storm rather then fearing it.There are so many things that are wrong with The Perfect Storm that I now realise that my review looks like a pan. It isn't. Infact this is one of the most visceral cinematic experiences I've had all year. The granduer, the size, the force of the raging sea could never be adequatly described in a review. Out there, in the dark the black water takes on a viscous quality, and the 100ft waves of that Perfect storm resemble mountains formed and crumbled by a mindless force that couldn't care less about six fishermen trapped in the middle of it all. Yes, I would love to see a Terrance Malick version of The Perfect Storm with more psychological, emotional and scientific depth, but lets face it, that version wouldn't have grossed one tenth of its cost. The credits for this one say &quot;A Wofgang Petersen film, starring George Clooney&quot;, I think &quot;An ILM film starring Big Wave&quot; would have been more accurate.If you plan on seeing The Perfect Storm on the small screen then downgrade my rating to 3 stars.",4,Shape Shifting Liquid Mountains,970358400,"10 1, 2000",2000,4472,"['said', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'done', 'director', 'Wolfgand', 'Petersen', 'managed', 'make', 'sensational', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'mediocre', 'script', 'Petersen', 'film', 'more', 'exhilerating', 'showcase', 'ILM', 'magnificant', 'storm', 'effects', 'then', 'moving', 'account', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'took', 'place', 'coast', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'fall', '1991', 'result', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'Mary', 'Elizabeth', 'Mastrantonio', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'here', 'more', 'uncomforatble', 'then', 'moving', 'Given', 'fact', 'characters', 'were', 'based', 'real', 'people', 'last', 'sentence', 'may', 'seem', 'offensive', 'fault', 'squarely', 'William', 'Wittliff', 'one', 'dimensional', 'characterisations.The', 'film', 'fishermen', 'returning', 'home', 'catch', 'Petersen', 'extra-hard', 'capture', 'flavors', 'accents', 'small', 'town', 'Gloucester', 'Mass', 'are', 'scenes', 'local', 'saloon', 'where', 'Springsteen', 'Hungry', 'Heart', 'fishermen', 'are', 'reunited', 'lovers', 'mothers', 'ex-wives', 'Petersen', 'attempts', 'are', 'thwarted', 'Wittliff', 'shallow', 'writing', 'are', 'introduced', 'skipper', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'George', 'Clooney', 'who', 'walks', 'around', 'flannel', 'shirt', 'looking', 'movie', 'star', 'spouting', 'lines', 'quot', 'am', 'doing', 'what', 'was', 'made', 'do', 'quot', 'Then', 'Bobby', 'Shafford', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'deeply', 'debt', 'deeply', 'love', 'Christina', 'Cotter', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'rest', 'Andria', 'Gail', 'six', 'man', 'crew', 'are', 'Murph', 'John', 'C.Reilly', 'who', 'friendly', 'relationship', 'ex-wife', 'Sully', 'William', 'Fichtner', 'who', 'made', 'screenwriter', 'hate', 'Murph', 'thus', 'provide', 'film', 'badly', 'written', 'scenes', 'tension', 'reconcilation', 'storm', 'Alfred', 'Pierre', 'Alan', 'Payne', 'Jamican', 'fisherman', 'who', 'entirely', 'background', 'Bugsy', 'John', 'Hawkes', 'who', 'film', 'most', 'endearing', 'character', 'infact', 'would', 'seem', 'screenwriter', 'idea', 'comic', 'relief', 'were', ""n't"", 'real', 'person', 'Where', 'screenwriters', 'manage', 'create', 'real', 'people', 'thin', 'air', 'Wittliff', 'taken', 'real', 'people', 'molded', 'convenient', 'stock', 'Horner', 'score', 'fine', 'piece', 'music', 'terribly', 'used', 'film-makers', 'intention', 'was', 'present', 'real', 'people', 'could', 'care', 'peril', 'why', 'Horner', 'orchestral', 'score', 'accompany', 'seemingly', 'routine', 'fishing', 'trip', 'six', 'guys', 'are', 'heading', 'sea', 'catch', 'fish', 'Horner', 'music', 'are', 'infact', 'destined', 'meet', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'title', 'game', 'away.Gradually', 'Petersen', 'futile', 'attempts', 'human', 'drama', 'shifts', 'attention', 'what', 'ultimately', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'awe-inspiring', 'genuinely', 'terrifying', 'storm', 'completely', 'perfunctory', 'cameo', 'Christopher', 'McDonald', 'meteoroligist', 'who', 'only', 'describe', 'what', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'quot', 'frankly', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'narration', 'opening', 'credits', 'doing', 'just', 'parallel', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'rescue', 'attempts', 'sailboat', 'called', 'Mistral', 'only', 'tease', 'audience', 'spectacle', 'storm', 'crew', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'will', 'soon', 'encounter', 'time', 'ridiculous', 'lines', 'such', 'quot', 'time', 'seperate', 'men', 'boys', 'quot', 'quot', ""'re"", 'heading', 'right', 'heart', 'monster', 'quot', 'have', 'been', 'uttered', 'straight', 'audience', 'forced', 'criminal', 'position', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'dreaded', 'storm', 'rather', 'then', 'fearing', 'it.There', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'wrong', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'now', 'realise', 'review', 'pan', ""n't"", 'Infact', 'one', 'most', 'visceral', 'cinematic', 'experiences', ""'ve"", 'had', 'year', 'granduer', 'size', 'force', 'raging', 'sea', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'adequatly', 'described', 'review', 'there', 'dark', 'black', 'water', 'viscous', 'quality', '100ft', 'waves', 'Perfect', 'storm', 'resemble', 'mountains', 'formed', 'crumbled', 'mindless', 'force', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'six', 'fishermen', 'trapped', 'middle', 'Yes', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'Terrance', 'Malick', 'version', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'more', 'psychological', 'emotional', 'scientific', 'depth', 'face', 'version', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'grossed', 'one', 'tenth', 'cost', 'credits', 'one', 'say', 'quot', 'A', 'Wofgang', 'Petersen', 'film', 'starring', 'George', 'Clooney', 'quot', 'think', 'quot', 'ILM', 'film', 'starring', 'Big', 'Wave', 'quot', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accurate.If', 'plan', 'seeing', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'small', 'screen', 'then', 'downgrade', 'rating', '3', 'stars']",N/A

527399,A1S0TB8S4Y7CIQ,B00003CXJC,Nicholas Stix,"[1, 2]","Four-and-a-half starsI am writing this on the twelfth anniversary of the incident depicted in The Perfect Storm.Before the movie even begins, you know it's going to be special. As the Warner Brothers logos appear in turn, we hear the slow, pensive chords of an acoustic guitar, followed by the mournful horns, and then the strings, of James Horner's score.Starting with the first guitar chord, we are treated to a stunning, eight-minute, opening sequence. We see a ship in the harbor of Gloucester, Massachusetts; a man on the dock, spreading out a plastic container of fish; a shipbuilder at work, much like his ancestors, 350 years before; men on the dock working with netting; Gloucester City Hall, and the honor roll inside; the statue of the ""Fisherman at the Wheel&quot;; a storm over the ocean; a sleeping woman crying out from a nightmare the name of her seafaring lover; and the fishing boats' return with their catch, the next morning. A sense of foreboding pervades the proceedings.Whereas in other towns, the honor roll would be of men lost in foreign wars, at Gloucester City Hall, it is of the over 10,000 fishermen lost at sea, from circa 1623 unto the present day.When the sister fishing boats the Andrea Gail and Hannah Boden triumphantly enter the harbor, the mournful theme is replaced by a loud, celebratory one, with electric guitars and rapid bursts of horns. Women run to the dock, to greet their men; children speed there on bikes, to meet their fathers. It is as if the men were returning war heroes. And they are heroes, every last one of them.Some ships' payloads burst with swordfish weighing almost 500 pounds; others' pithy catches fail to make it to 100 pounds. We hear true Massachusetts accents. Along with the fishermen greeted by their families, we see those who have no families to greet them, or whose families have deserted them, men who work so hard, and for so little, that many cannot even afford a car. Their essential, honorable work, virtually unchanged for centuries, lacks all glamor, and they live without dreams or sentimentality. And yet, they do battle with nature, and do things that few today could physically survive doing, let alone do well.A fisherman who passed away at sea, is carried away on a stretcher. Horner has the celebratory and mournful themes play point and counterpoint to each other. Even in joy, there is sadness.The bringing in of a catch is rough, mundane work, if you're busy at it, but a thing of wonder to behold. Director Wolfgang Peterson, cinematographer John Seale, and Horner, give the proceedings the epic treatment they deserve.Aspiring filmmakers would do well to study those first eight minutes, to learn how to establish plot, place, and characters.In late October, 1991, as tropical hurricane Grace came north from Bermuda, she hit a storm system off Sable Island, on the Canadian coast, and was hit by a third system coming down from Canada, which had hitched a ride on the jet stream, to form an apocalyptic ""tripleheader."" It was the storm of the century - ""the perfect storm.""George Clooney is gripping, if flawed, as Capt. Billy Tyne, who thinks there's nothing greater on earth, than being a swordfish boat captain. But Tyne has apparently lost his touch for finding where the fish are, and might lose his ""site"" (boat), if he doesn't start bringing in some big loads. Fast. And so, at the end of the season, he decides to go out for one last run. But what Capt. Tyne doesn't tell anyone, especially his boat's owner, who has expressly forbidden him from doing, is that he is headed for the Flemish Cap, hundreds of miles east of his usual fishing grounds, where there's ""lots of fish ... and lots of weather."" What Capt. Tyne doesn't know, is that he is heading straight into hell.Tyne practically shanghais his men into the additional trip, threatening them with losing their sites (jobs) on his boat.At dawn, when the men assemble to leave, bidding their women farewell, they look like motley gunslingers headed to the big gunfight, evoking the scene in The Wild Bunch, when Bill Holden's ""Pike Bishop"" says to Ernie Borgnine's ""Dutch,"" ""Let's go.""Eventually, the men must choose whether to risk their ship and their lives for a huge catch, or return home abject failures. The decision isn't about greed, it's about honor and pride.The supporting roles are exquisitely cast. Passionaria Diane Lane, as crewman Bobby Shatford's lover, Christina ""Chris"" Cotter, has the Massachusetts accent down, and is believable, if at times over the top, as a woman desperately in love, who sees a way out of a dead-end life, that she fears the sea will steal from her. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is solid as Linda Greenlaw, the successful swordfish boat captain who beckons to the hardbitten loner, Tyne, in her restrained fashion, as the partner he so desperately needs and desires, if only he has the sense to reach out to her. As Dale ""Murph"" Murphy, the face of John C. Reilly is a map of loss and regret. Murph's crewmate-antagonist, David ""Sully"" Sullivan (William Fichtener) has seemingly little to gain or lose in life. Michael ""Bugsy"" Moran (John Hawkes) is a man who, in spite of being consistently beaten down by life, has not lost his charm or sense of humor. As easygoing Alfred Pierre, Allen Payne makes the most of a sketchily-written role.The special effects were so realistic, as to maintain their grip on my wife and me. Special effects that are ""too good,"" that depict things that couldn't possibly occur in reality, leave me indifferent to whether things pan out on the screen.While The Perfect Storm abounds in seat-of-the-pants action, it is always about the character of men in dire straits, which is why we care about them.Finally, you might want to keep a fresh box of Kleenex handy.Originally published in

527402,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B00003CXJC,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[2, 2]","Here we have a film, based upon events during an incredibly large storm of the 1990s, which involves a crew of fishermen [George Clooney plays this small ship's captain] who go far beyond the traditional fishing waters into a more promising area for fishing but where the dangers of the oceans are significantly more prevalent. Of course, they are caught in the storm of the century.The sub-plots extend to an unfortunate family of people on a sailboat headed for Bermuda plus all the drama associated with worried families and friends back onshore, the U.S. Coast Guard rescuers, the melodramatic weather forecasters, and so on. I found the plot to be egregiously predictable.I see this movie as a classic example of modern Hollywood productions where the producers and the director have targeted younger audiences, ergo: attempting to fulfill a need for endless action, thus paying little homage to any deeper story. This is somewhat true of the disaster film genre in general, even from the days ofAirport (Widescreen Edition); however, the more contemporary productions only superficially skim the personal drama and focus on the chaos. The result? Panicked people yelling at one another over the great cacophony from beginning to end. It's just too much and most older viewers will quickly tire of it.The computer-generated images [CGI] are pretty good as are the actual stunts. But the story itself is much lacking. It only took me a few minutes to generally lose interest in this film although I toughed it out to the end in the vain hope that it would improve -- it didn't. But life is not the same for everyone.

I heard all the commentaries, I saw the commercials on TV, I went to the theater to see what they announce it's an epic movie full of emotions and full of good cinema... and here is what I found:  a) Special effects not so perfect as they say.  b) A sailor called George Clooney who only needed a stethoscope to be a perfect Ace from ""E/R"" (1984). Perhaps he thank that by using a strange grimace here and there he would become a perfect sailor...? Almost the whole movie it looks like he's posing for the girls at the other side of the screen. Is it perhaps that he was told to do that...? John Hawkes is a hundred times better as a sailor than him. A lot of people won't like what I'll say, but Clooney is for me an awful actor. While Paul Newman is a good-looking man and also a brilliant actor (try to imagine him (of course, a young Paul) in the role of the captain...), George Clooney is just a good-looking man.  c) A child actor who does not convince at all. OK, he's only a child, but this is Hollywood at its best!  d) A, let's say, strange story ending. When the film finished I was just waiting for another twenty minutes, so I said to myself, is that really all of it...? Of course, I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I won't say any more details.  e) A suggested telepathy phenomenon out of place in my opinion. I won't say where it appears to avoid this commentary from being a spoiler.  These are, among others, some of the things I dislike. This movie is nothing to write home about. It's entertaining, but it's mediocre. Perhaps the great mistake about it was the movie itself. In Twister (1996), for example, you see people running away from the wind cone, you see a bright day turning into a dark green sky, there is always something new to catch your eye and keep you interested. In this film we just see the giant waves here and there, and more waves, and more waves. When you see one, you have seen them all. If that's not enough, the actors don't do their best, and the plot is so simple that you wonder if there is really a plot behind the scenes.

And the effort shows in this fine film.  Sure, it takes a few creative liberties, but 1) this is drama, and 2) we don't know absolutely everything that happened out there in real life.  So, I can live with the creative liberties.  Anyway, George Clooney leads a band of fisherman out to sea after a previous trip brought them a poor haul and complaints from their boss/the boat's owner.

The movie has some decent moments, but overall it drags along.  George Clooney proved he could carry a film as the movie was a huge success at the box office, but it is not one of his finest acting jobs.  He goes through the film in a sullen sort of mood and he appears to be just collecting a paycheck.  Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane are unconvincing as a couple.  Ms. Lane seems far too old to be with Mr. Wahlberg and they don't generate any sparks.  The film is based on the deadly noreaster that ran up the Atlantic Coastline in late '91.  Mr. Clooney is Billy Tyne, the captain of a sword fishing boat, the Andrea Gail. The last few trips out have been busts for the ship and Tyne wants to go out for one last score for the season.  Mr. Wahlberg and John C. Reilly are two members of his crew.  They head out and at first, they come up empty again.  Tyne decides to head out further to the Flemish Cap.  The crew is undecided at first, but agree to the idea.  They hit it big at the Cap, but due to a faulty ice machine, they must head back.  They head right into the center of the storm.  The depiction of the storm is what saves the movie.  The rolling ocean waves, torrential rain and winds are lifelike and frightening. The giant 100-foot wave that the Andrea Gail hits is truly an incredible effect.  There are a few sidebar stories involving a sailboat and military rescue team.  Outside of the effects, the plot is thin and alot of situations are not explained.  The characters are stock personalities and you never really care about them.  The movie is all about the wave and in that instance, it delivers.

Some desperate fishermen set out to sea to make the last catch of the fishing season count and get caught in a stormy crossover.  Can man face-up against nature's fury ? That's the subliminal question asked and the answer is overwhelmingly obvious. That's the script. The screenplay is the worst I've had to endure in a long time and the dialogue is too corny. This goes on for about an hour and a half until the effects take over. This whole movie is all about great visual and sound effects ... and ultimately save this movie from being just another forgotten flick. The sound and visual effects department deserve Oscars for their respective categories. Without them this movie is unwatchable. The cast try hard (too hard sometimes ...) to breathe life into their lifeless characters as they somehow try to rise above the rotten script. In a few scenes they do succeed.

Heck, I even live in Rockport, the next town over from Gloucester.But this movie, except for the special effects, was awful. If you were to strip away all of the digital imagery, the alluring ocean storm, and okay acting, you would be left with a half-baked story that does not establish any basis whatsoever for respecting the protagonist(s).I, for one, was not moved by Clooney's &quot;powerful&quot; Act 2 climax declaration of &quot;I always find the fish!&quot; It was almost laughable. They were going for Scarlet's &quot;I will never go hungry again,&quot; and they got something much, much less to put it kindly. The problem was that they were unable to mask - despite a *valiant* effort - what really happened here. A group of men made bad decision after bad decision, with money and greed as their motive, ignoring their loved one's advice, and they got themselves killed. When you strip away all the rhetoric, that's what you get.And I was literally embarrassed for Diane Lane. You know when you go to a talent show and the performer is so bad that you actually feel embarrassed for her? That's how it was with Lane. Not only the accent - I mean please - but the acting. They had her going for the Oscar in every scene, and when I was supposed to feel bad for her, I was literally chuckling and shaking my head. I have never seen such overacting in any movie, ever. Ever.And what about the &quot;Perfect&quot; storm? Why was it perfect? What was so amazing about it? There is almost *nothing* in the movie about the dynamics of the storm system that led to these events. Other than telling you that 3 systems are colliding, there is nothing else mentioned about the uniqueness of this situation.Had it not been for the special effects I would have given it one star. The ocean was magnificent. I'm not even going to talk about the ridiculously unrealistic events that occurred, because you expect that sort of thing in this kind of movie.

It stars George Clooney as Billy Tyne, the Captain of the Andrea Gail, with a crew of four others, Mark Wahlberg among them, as they act out this true-life film.This movie begins with Tyne and his crew making a last fishing trip out to the distant Flemish Cap to compensate for a poor and low-paying fishing season. After they get there, the fishing is pretty successful and they get by with few problems. When the ice machine breaks down, they hurry back to save their catch before the existing supply of ice vanishes and the swordfish perish. Before they head back, three powerful storm fronts combine to make one enormous, &quot;perfect&quot; storm. On the way back, they inevitably run into the storm and must fight no longer for the catch, but their lives.Some things which I liked about the movie were the beautifully computer-generated waves, the tough action during the  storm encounter, and the way that a great story was narrated.  I disliked in this movie some of the drama, for a bit of it was touching and appropriate but some got a little boring, the beginning, because the complaining and lack of excitement got old fast, and how a bit of the technicality went over my head and lost me a little at the end.Basically, the movie was great, but in my opinion, too long.

In the movie version of reality, he clearly makes poor judgement calls that eventually lead to the deaths of all on board, including himself.  Bummer.Wolfgang Peterson (""Das Boot"") does not deliver the full-throttle action film the posters proclaim. Although the special effects are serviceable and in some cases eye-popping, there's never a moment when one forgets it's all fake; sets, props, miniatures and computer generated images.  That said, it's the surround sound that really connects with a super realistic sense of a monstrous raging sea. In fact, in some ways the movie's better if you close your eyes for the last hour and picture it in your head!While this film really lacks any actual drama or characterization, it is still amazing to witness the level of digital manipulation available to the filmmaker.The luminous Diane Lane is wasted in a nothing part.  Mark Wahlberg does his best as a hard working blue collar guy with a dream of a better life. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is a rival fisherperson who has had a run of good luck and a never explained ""friendship"" with Clooney's unappealing Tyne.Even though we meet the main characters in a lengthy, and very formula set-up, the more we know, the less we care.  The rooting interest is very low, leaving the final extended storm sequence devoid of any emotional involvement. Sadly, the sense of terror is detached.The DVD is loaded with special features including three behind the scenes documentaries and three richly informed feature length commentaries (filmmaker/author/craftsperson).

527421,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXJC,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","Wolfgang Petersen's ""The Perfect Storm"" is based on the true story of a Gloucester shipping boat that was lost at sea in the north Atlantic in October 1991.  The crew of this small vessel had the tragic misfortune of being caught in what meteorologists came to refer to as ""The Storm of the Century,"" a virtually unprecedented merging of three huge storm systems into a raging, colossal ""monster.""The fact that we know the outcome of the story beforehand actually works a bit in the film's favor.  This knowledge adds an air of additional poignancy to what might otherwise be pretty standard, sappy stuff, particularly in the early stretches of the film when we are introduced to the various romantic travails of each of the men on board.  Because we know how it will all end, we are left to muse over the part fate plays in each of our lives.  Of course, this also makes for an intriguing hybrid between fiction and nonfiction since, without surviving eyewitness accounts of the event, most of the details about what actually happened on the boat emerge as pure speculation.The limitation of this type of man-against-nature scenario is that it rarely leaves much time for character development - and ""The Perfect Storm"" is no exception.  Probably the most well developed figure is that of the boat's captain, Billy Tyne, well played by George Clooney.  Here is a man so obsessed with overcoming his recent fish-catching slump that he ultimately endangers his own life and the lives of his crewmembers to salvage his reputation.  One aspect of the character does strike me as a bit strange, though.  Why does he seem to be the character in the film least informed as to the severity of the storm he is facing?  His competence as a sea captain is brought into question by this fact alone.The other problem is, of course, that, despite the technical brilliance of the special effects, one wave begins to look pretty much like another after awhile - and the characters end up getting lost in the turmoil.  It's true that we don't go to these types of movies for intense character development, but still we crave that little something extra that would lighten some of the dramatic tedium that eventually sets in.Oh well, much of this is washed away in the emotionally wrenching finale, a worthy tribute to the crew of the Andrea Gail as well as to all the men and women who have lost their lives at sea.",3,built-in repetitiousness,998524800,"08 23, 2001",2001,2399,"['Wolfgang', 'Petersen', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Gloucester', 'shipping', 'boat', 'was', 'lost', 'sea', 'north', 'Atlantic', 'October', '1991', 'crew', 'small', 'vessel', 'had', 'tragic', 'misfortune', 'being', 'caught', 'what', 'meteorologists', 'came', 'refer', 'Storm', 'Century', 'virtually', 'unprecedented', 'merging', 'three', 'huge', 'storm', 'systems', 'raging', 'colossal', 'monster', 'fact', 'know', 'outcome', 'story', 'beforehand', 'actually', 'bit', 'film', 'favor', 'knowledge', 'air', 'additional', 'poignancy', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'pretty', 'standard', 'sappy', 'stuff', 'particularly', 'early', 'stretches', 'film', 'when', 'are', 'introduced', 'various', 'romantic', 'travails', 'men', 'board', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'are', 'left', 'muse', 'part', 'fate', 'plays', 'lives', 'course', 'also', 'intriguing', 'hybrid', 'fiction', 'nonfiction', 'surviving', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'event', 'most', 'details', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'boat', 'emerge', 'pure', 'speculation.The', 'limitation', 'type', 'man-against-nature', 'scenario', 'rarely', 'much', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'Perfect', 'Storm', 'exception', 'Probably', 'most', 'well', 'developed', 'figure', 'boat', 'captain', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'well', 'played', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Here', 'man', 'so', 'obsessed', 'overcoming', 'recent', 'fish-catching', 'slump', 'ultimately', 'own', 'life', 'lives', 'crewmembers', 'salvage', 'reputation', 'One', 'aspect', 'character', 'strike', 'bit', 'strange', 'though', 'Why', 'seem', 'be', 'character', 'film', 'least', 'informed', 'severity', 'storm', 'facing', 'competence', 'sea', 'captain', 'brought', 'question', 'fact', 'other', 'problem', 'course', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'special', 'effects', 'one', 'wave', 'look', 'pretty', 'much', 'awhile', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'lost', 'turmoil', 'true', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'types', 'movies', 'intense', 'character', 'development', 'still', 'crave', 'little', 'something', 'extra', 'would', 'lighten', 'dramatic', 'tedium', 'eventually', 'in.Oh', 'well', 'much', 'washed', 'away', 'emotionally', 'wrenching', 'finale', 'worthy', 'tribute', 'crew', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'as', 'well', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'lost', 'lives', 'sea']",N/A

He was also able to give a wealth of background information on the New England sword-fishing industry that was able to help you look into the minds of the Andrea Gail's crew.  The novel helped you to understand why they would make the seemingly insane decision to plunge themselves into the middle of a hurricane.

It is a movie about men driven by a love of the sea in some cases, and a need to make money in other, who risk their lives on a daily basis in order to catch swordfish.  I find it amazing that in this day and age with all sorts of technology available man is still at the mercy of the nature-----especially those who fish.  Despite radios and helicopters and satellites tracking weather fronts, the crew of the Andrea Gail could have been replaced by the crew of a fishing boat from 1882 or 1902 and their battle against nature, would not have changed.  The toll hurricanes have taken in life and property this summer alone is proof of how we are at nature's mercy.Family members waiting helplessly for a loved one coming back from a dangerous occupation is another timeless theme explored in this movie.  Diane Lane is convincing as the girl friend who does not want her fianc&eacute; to go on the fateful trip.  The extras on the DVD include Sebastian Junger talking about what it was like writing the book and offers added insight into his meetings with family members of the crew of the Andrea Gail.Then there are the rescuers who go out in the storms and risk their lives to save others.  I can't imagine what it must be like to go by helicopter or boat into a storm in order to save those who can't get out of harms way.The fact that the story is based on a true event adds much to the movie.  I can only wonder when I hear of a hurricane, tropical storm or blizzard or any event where man is at the mercy of nature, what it must be like for those facing the storm, rather than watching the effects of the storm on television while in the safety of their home.The movie focuses more on George Clooney's and Mark Walhberg's characters than on the other characters.

The early scenes are bit maudlin as the film tries to compress a lot of emotional background into a minimum of film time before getting out to sea.  Some of the feigned New England accents are truly painful (the award for worst effort goes to the actress playing Captain Linda Greenlaw, a hideous parody of a Downeast Maine accent).  Mark Wahlberg turns in a workmanlike performance as Bobby Shatford, whose girlfriend begs him not to go on the voyage.  Clooney is okay as the doomed Captain Billy Tyne, but the film is trying to accomplish too much in too little time, so no one really gets to develop their character.

527437,AKP40TIE5SVSQ,B00003CXJC,Some Gravity,"[3, 6]","When people think of the year 1991, there are probably several different things that come to their mind. When I think of 1991, there are several different things that come to my head about the stuff that happened that year.One of them is the storm that the fishing boat Andrea Gail encountered. If you were living in Boston when the storm occured(which I was, at the time)and if you read Sebastion Junger's novel about what really happened, then you will probably find this film an excellent look at what really happened. Read on for my review of this:First of all, before I comment on the movie,let me start off with talking about what really happened. The time: October 1991. The place: Gloucestor, Massachusetts. At that time and that place, Billy Tyne(who is portrayed by George Clooney in this film)was the captain of the Andrea Gail(that fishing boat that I already mentioned), and even though he had a reputation as a really good fishing captain,lately, him and his fishermen had not been lucky when it comes to the matter of going fishing for a living. But before the Andrea Gail went in before the next fishing season,Tyne wanted to take his fishermen out for one more time to catch their fish. Everybody in his crew was different-Bobby Shatford(portrayed by Mark Wahlberg in this film)had a girlfriend named Christina Cotter (portrayed by Diane Lane in this film)who was all over him(as well as he was all over her),another crew member named Sully(John C. Reilly) had an ex-wife and a son who he did not get to see much because of his job- you get the point. Even though everyone in the crew was different,the whole crew(with the exception of one member, who would be replaced)went out one more time to get more fish and more money after Tyne had offered them the job.Now, on to the film. First, let me cover the first hour of the film. As already mentioned by several other Amazon reviewers,the first hour of the film is pretty good. Actually, really good. While the first hour is not suspenseful,the chemistry between the characters flows really well,and the person who wrote the script for this film did a good job at showing the people how the real people portrayed in this film got along poorly(read the book for more info on that). The second hour is great. It is kind of like the first ""Die Hard"" film at sea-the crew members of the boat were fighting a storm that would eventually take their lives,while they were talking to another fishing boat that had been caught out in the storm and was trying to get out. I won't give away evrything,but the second hour of this film will really get your attention and You will probably find yourself keeping your eyes on the screen.If you can get a copy of this film, be sure to get it on DVD. I have this on VHS, but I've watched it on DVD- and the DVD has special features, and one even shows you a behind the scenes look at the making of this film. As for the rest of the film, like I said, the script was really good,the special effects are very impressive, and the perfromances are really good. Like I already said, I was living in Boston at the time this storm occured(I spent two days without light and I had to use candles for that source)so watching this film and seeing how Hollywood portrayed what really happened was really interesting for me to see. The best performances in this film were George Clooney's performance of Billy Tyne, Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Bobby Shatford,and Diane Lane's performance of Christina Cottter, even though Lane looks NOTHING like Cotter in real life(I once saw a picture of Cotter in a magazine).I highly recommend this film-especially if You're into films like this that deal with bad weather.",5,Excellent Look at what Really Happened,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,3699,"['When', 'people', 'think', 'year', '1991', 'are', 'probably', 'several', 'different', 'things', 'come', 'mind', 'When', 'think', '1991', 'are', 'several', 'different', 'things', 'come', 'head', 'stuff', 'happened', 'year.One', 'storm', 'fishing', 'boat', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'encountered', 'were', 'living', 'Boston', 'when', 'storm', 'occured', 'was', 'time', 'read', 'Sebastion', 'Junger', 'novel', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'film', 'excellent', 'look', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Read', 'review', 'First', 'comment', 'movie', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'talking', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'time', 'October', '1991', 'place', 'Gloucestor', 'Massachusetts', 'time', 'place', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'who', 'portrayed', 'George', 'Clooney', 'film', 'was', 'captain', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'fishing', 'boat', 'already', 'mentioned', 'even', 'had', 'reputation', 'really', 'good', 'fishing', 'captain', 'lately', 'fishermen', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'lucky', 'when', 'matter', 'going', 'fishing', 'living', 'Andrea', 'Gail', 'went', 'next', 'fishing', 'season', 'Tyne', 'wanted', 'take', 'fishermen', 'out', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'catch', 'fish', 'Everybody', 'crew', 'was', 'different-Bobby', 'Shatford', 'portrayed', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'film', 'had', 'girlfriend', 'named', 'Christina', 'Cotter', 'portrayed', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'film', 'who', 'was', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'crew', 'member', 'named', 'Sully', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'had', 'ex-wife', 'son', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'much', 'job-', 'get', 'point', 'Even', 'everyone', 'crew', 'was', 'different', 'whole', 'crew', 'exception', 'one', 'member', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'went', 'one', 'more', 'time', 'get', 'more', 'fish', 'more', 'money', 'Tyne', 'had', 'offered', 'job.Now', 'film', 'First', 'let', 'cover', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'already', 'mentioned', 'several', 'other', 'Amazon', 'reviewers', 'first', 'hour', 'film', 'pretty', 'good', 'Actually', 'really', 'good', 'first', 'hour', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'really', 'well', 'person', 'who', 'wrote', 'script', 'film', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'people', 'how', 'real', 'people', 'portrayed', 'film', 'got', 'along', 'poorly', 'read', 'book', 'more', 'info', 'second', 'hour', 'great', 'kind', 'first', 'Die', 'Hard', 'film', 'sea-the', 'crew', 'members', 'boat', 'were', 'fighting', 'storm', 'would', 'eventually', 'take', 'lives', 'were', 'talking', 'fishing', 'boat', 'had', 'been', 'caught', 'out', 'storm', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'evrything', 'second', 'hour', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'get', 'attention', 'will', 'probably', 'find', 'keeping', 'eyes', 'screen.If', 'can', 'get', 'copy', 'film', 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'DVD', 'have', 'VHS', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'DVD-', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'one', 'even', 'scenes', 'look', 'making', 'film', 'rest', 'film', 'said', 'script', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'very', 'impressive', 'perfromances', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'already', 'said', 'was', 'living', 'Boston', 'time', 'storm', 'occured', 'spent', 'two', 'days', 'light', 'had', 'use', 'candles', 'source', 'so', 'watching', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'portrayed', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'best', 'performances', 'film', 'were', 'George', 'Clooney', 'performance', 'Billy', 'Tyne', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'portrayal', 'Bobby', 'Shatford', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'performance', 'Christina', 'Cottter', 'even', 'Lane', 'NOTHING', 'Cotter', 'real', 'life', 'once', 'saw', 'picture', 'Cotter', 'magazine', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film-especially', ""'re"", 'films', 'deal', 'bad', 'weather']",N/A

I do have the Standard Def DVD of the Perfect Storm and have just finished watching my new copy of it on Blu RayThe video transfer is really very good with strong depth and details in the shadow areas and no stairstepping, aliasing or artifacts that I could detect.  The color correction in the original post production accented the greys so you shouldn't expect sparkling colors to pop out at you.  However, when the characters are in town, in the bar, there is a real life effect to the cinematography that keeps the colors true.  As video transfers go, this one is almost demo quality.  Not quite but almost.The audio is Dolby Digital True HD 5.1 EX which really comes into play when the boat and men are out to sea.  Because the storm is all around, much of the audio is more encompassing of the 5.1 channels as opposed to discreet channel to channel.  However, there is plenty that is directional and, as far as the audio is concerned, this is a fine DVD to show off your system with.There were plenty of extras including interviews of people who lived through the storm on land.  No interviews with relatives of those who did not survive and no deleted or extended scenes.  I did have a few problems navigating the Extras menu,  I think I went through 40 different languages before I could get to where I wanted.

The film, which is very stirring, has a few scenes that feel like I watched them in a TV movie. The story of the rescue crews was exciting, and the scenes of people anxiously awaiting the return of loved ones were emotional, and the visual effects were incredible. But the main story, that of the crew of the fishing boat &quot;Andrea Gail,&quot; as Alec Baldwin put it in an article in a PEARL HARBOR movie magazine, seems to &quot;mythologize and make the characters more heroic than they really were.&quot; Even though I don't doubt their bravery, based on the job they had, even I wouldn't be stupid enough to try to make it home through a storm THAT enormous. I still can't believe that this film, which grossed $183 Million at the box office, beat THE PATRIOT ($113 Million), my FAVORITE film of all time. Despite it's many flaws, this film does honor the crew of the &quot;Andrea Gail,&quot; and the U.S. Coast Guard. And the moral of the story: If you try to fight the sea, you most likely will not win.

Corny and inaccurate characterization, fictitious events, textbook plotting, and James Horner's typically inane score are all called upon to wring sympathy from the audience and to while away the first hour until the storm - the only reason for this film's existence - actually hits. When it does, it's amazing. Rendered in mind-blowing CGI, it is utterly spectacular. But this very spectacle actually works against the film: as depicted, the storm is so fierce and so realistic that you simply cannot believe anyone would even be able to STAND UP on the boat, let alone climb atop the bridge to fix the antenna, attempt to board up the windows, or have time for heartfelt goodbyes - not with the ship lurching at what looks like 89 degrees in 300 knot winds with 4000 cubic liters of water crashing onto the deck every three seconds. It was just too much to take. Sure, it looks great. But is that the only point? Perhaps it is.  In any case, there's something a little tasteless about the whole affair. The film is based on true story.  To embellish the tragedy with spurious story elements, imaginary conflicts, and fantasized romances as a means of packaging 60 minutes of CGI for the summer 'event film' market - and then to have the gall to promote it as a 'true story' - may well have been a savvy bit of marketing, but it strikes me as more than a little distasteful.",2,Tasteless,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,1479,"['fine', 'example', 'what', 'when', 'real', 'events', 'are', 'tortured', 'shape', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'Corny', 'inaccurate', 'characterization', 'fictitious', 'events', 'textbook', 'plotting', 'James', 'Horner', 'typically', 'inane', 'score', 'are', 'called', 'upon', 'wring', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'while', 'away', 'first', 'hour', 'storm', 'only', 'reason', 'film', 'existence', 'actually', 'hits', 'When', 'amazing', 'Rendered', 'mind-blowing', 'CGI', 'utterly', 'spectacular', 'very', 'spectacle', 'actually', 'film', 'depicted', 'storm', 'so', 'fierce', 'so', 'realistic', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'anyone', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'able', 'STAND', 'UP', 'boat', 'let', 'alone', 'climb', 'bridge', 'fix', 'antenna', 'attempt', 'board', 'up', 'windows', 'have', 'time', 'heartfelt', 'goodbyes', 'not', 'ship', 'lurching', 'what', '89', 'degrees', '300', 'knot', 'winds', '4000', 'cubic', 'liters', 'water', 'crashing', 'deck', 'three', 'seconds', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'take', 'Sure', 'great', 'only', 'point', 'Perhaps', 'case', 'something', 'little', 'tasteless', 'whole', 'affair', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'embellish', 'tragedy', 'spurious', 'story', 'elements', 'imaginary', 'conflicts', 'fantasized', 'romances', 'means', 'packaging', '60', 'minutes', 'CGI', 'summer', ""'event"", 'film', 'market', 'then', 'have', 'gall', 'promote', ""'true"", 'story', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'savvy', 'bit', 'marketing', 'more', 'little', 'distasteful']",N/A

The opportunity that I was interested to this movie at first was for that the main theme was weather phenomenon. I have known that incredible storms, their three storms touched each other, broke a few years ago, but I have not known about the detail things. I have the knowledge about weather to some extent because I am interested to weather phenomenon daily. For that, the movie that showed the rare phenomenon that theree storms including hurricane and cold front line etc contacted each other gave shock to me.In addition to that, the movie expressed such unbelievable theme very well. I think that it is natural that the makers use the artficial technique like computer graphics and so on. But because the movie theme was nature, using the technique must have needed many care. But in such rimitation, the great expression was made, for instance wave is so. The makers made high wave that we can never see in our life. The wave was very natural. The thirilling case even that a fishing ship dived into wave wall was expressed with incredible excitment very well.And except of their weather, there was climaxs in the movie. That was human drama. The main vhicle in the movie was a fishing ship. And the crew were wild and impoliteness in my first glance. But as the story went, my emotion for their changed little and little, that is to say, though they were a little crazy men who did the actions like diving to such storms, when I say in other view, they had bravery that they dared to go the storms without turning back, that was pure benefit that they derired to get back fishes to the hometown. Such bravery can be said to my daily life. As I am adult, tend to lose bravery and be timid, I felt that I should go to dangerouse scene even for achiving my goal in the movie.Finally, they had been drunk by wave. I expected that the last would be happy end even if whether the movie was on non-fiction or not.

The main scenes during the storm with Ahab's (Clooney's) boat had quite well-done effects and a zillion gallons of water, as you would expect, but they felt to me more like an extended car chase, where lots is happening while also not much is happening.The fine cast did not get much chance to develop, except for some spark from Clooney and Wahlberg and a few spots here and there. Otherwise some talent is wasted on stock roles such as Diane Lane's. At least an almost gaunt-looking Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was a ship captain herself, and not some homebody.The prelude to going to sea did not allow for much character development, which is ok, given that the movie is ""The Perfect Storm"" and not the drama of human interaction. However, that meant nothing of particular interest, either. The setup for Bugsy and Irene was unusual and almost embarrassing.I liked getting an idea what a sword boat looked like, how it operated, what they did with the fish, etc. Some more of that would have gone over well with me. The conflict between Murph and Sully seemed artificial and added little.It's probably not a good sign when the other rescue scene got me wondering about my tax dollars at work.

It is a classic clash of men against the elements. The storm is the real star of the show, nature on the rampage with waves of up to 30M high, and men and their works are reduced to insignificant pygmies, trying (and sometimes failing) to survive its impersonal fury. The element of personal combat with the sea is personified by the excellent George Clooney's fishing boat skipper, with his initial exhilaration at battling the storm, his joy at thwarting it by making a highly dangerous turn in mountainous seas and his gathering gloom when he realises that the sea isn't going to let him go quite that easily... This is counterpointed by the military precision and coolness (and even more gutsy performance) of the captain and crew of a US Coastguard cutter and an Air Force helicopter rescue crew going to the aid of a yacht in distress.The computer-generated big seas are seamlessly incorporated into live action in a big tank (although the cascading water is sometimes too obviously coming from a hose or some such device), to create tremendous images as the action switches from the fishermen to the Coastguard/Air Force rescuers. At times, things get a bit silly (George Clooney improbably swinging on a boom in wild seas while holding a burning oxy-acetylene torch). The ending is, unfortunately, excessively maudlin (which US audiences seem to like, or at least expect), but for me the movie does nicely encapsulate the spirit of those who go down to the sea in ships, as a fishing boat sets forth at the end, Cap'n Clooney's words echoing in that boat's captain's head. The whole thing is admirably complemented by an excellent musical score from James Horner.Although not a perfect film of the perfect storm, I enjoyed this, and it has encouraged me to order the book (damn you, Amazon!). The cast is strong, with Clooney acting the part of the slightly Ahab-ish ""born to fish"" captain with suitable intensity.

But what is so disturbing is that this tragic story is based on a real event, and one fairly recent.Like &quot;Titanic&quot; the audience knows of this film's ending.  But &quot;Titanic&quot; had 80 years for the world to heal a bit.  The tragedy of &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; occured in 1991.  I feel sorry for the families of the fishermen in the film, they have to relive this in their minds everyday and now it's on screen for everyone to laugh and cheer at.The subject matter of &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; is hardly appropriate for a big budget actioner.  This film owes more to &quot;Twister&quot; than &quot;Titanic&quot; in that it is presented as a roller coaster ride type of film.Dealing with the film itself, it's full of story and acting problems.  One major problem is the two separate storylines that have no relation to eachother.  Two ships lost in the storm, one makes it one doesn't.  But the biggest problem with this film has got to be Diane Lane's terrible accent.  Man, the producers of the film must really be pushing for an Oscar nomination for her because you couldn't get her off the screen!  Why are we so concerned about her when it's Clooney and his crew who are in jeopardy?  Because the producers are going for that &quot;Apollo 13&quot; wife at home Oscar nod.The acting in the film is fair, Clooney and Marky Mark to a pretty good job in getting the audience to fear for them.  The effects are first rate, sound, music... all of the technical stuff is good.  But the overall effort is disgraceful.

No one survived.  No one will ever know what happened.

The end of the movie is spoilt for several reasons: first the Weather Channel episode kills the suspense with the ""special report"", and then the actors are really not credible at the end. This is a problem, because in that sort of movie, the end is normally the climax of the story, the best part of it. Also there is another problem, because on several occasions, the movie contains stern moral statements about the fishermen and their family lives; it sometimes seems that the way of life of the fishermen is being tried, which is wrong in the context of that movie, especially because there is a lot of criticism, but not many constructive propositions.

The only downside is the fact that when you take a step back and look at it again, this film is sort of a bore. Sure there is a lot of action, but the action of the storm loses some of its steam.

It is clear that the forced emotion was done to  meet the  expectations of summer blockbuster movie fans,  I would love to see a  &quot;deleted nonsense&quot; version of this on dvd, but it will never  happen, so I give it 1 star for special effects, which were at least  impressive.",1,The Perfect Waste Of Time!,968198400,"09 6, 2000",2000,798,"['movie', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'story', 'quot', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'out', 'sea', 'quot', 'drowned', 'action', 'suspense', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', 'had', 'go', 'quot', 'pretending', 'be', 'emotional', 'quot', 'direction', 'did', 'was', 'turn', 'movie', 'mess', 'Had', 'left', 'out', 'forced', 'drama', 'girlfriends', 'boyfriends', 'pacing', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'actually', 'worked', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'half', 'bad', 'Wolfgang', 'Peterson', 'done', 'such', 'better', 'works', 'clear', 'forced', 'emotion', 'was', 'done', 'meet', 'expectations', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'movie', 'fans', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'quot', 'deleted', 'nonsense', 'quot', 'version', 'dvd', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'give', '1', 'star', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'least', 'impressive']",N/A

But the last hour more than makes up for it; lotsa great scenes of man vs. the sea.  I'm not even that big of a George Clooney fan, but he was fantastic in this film as the captain of the doomed fishing boat.
