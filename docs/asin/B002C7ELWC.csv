1262422,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B002C7ELWC,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 3]","I'm hesitant to see about 95% of comedians live or even to buy the products because I don't want to hear one long session of constantly using the n-word and the b-word like it's a synonym for women, complaining about women, embarrassing audience members and talking about black people versus white people. I've seen it. I never laugh. It's not at all creative. There are comedians I absolutely love to see perform and then there's the other 95% that could stop doing jokes tomorrow and I'd volunteer to help them pack it up. But I did give this DVD a shot because I've liked performances from 4 of the 5. By the end of the DVD, it dropped to 3 of the 5.#1 Cedric the Entertainer: Love him! Everything about him! He's clean, he's sharp, he keeps his comedy clever and it's feel-good funny, even though I could do without the n-word.#2 Kevin Hart: He's fast topping my last of top five. After seeingSeriously Funny, I was so impressed by him. I like that he doesn't just rely on the usual suspects to be funny. He definitely could calm down on the b-word, but I'm somehow not offended when he uses it, mainly because he'll call himself one. Hard to be offended when you crack jokes about yourself.#3 Tommy Davidson: I can take him in small doses. He's cool, but he's always a little extra. Like, I like him but he doesn't know when to stop the joke. The Spanish TV and the Cops jokes were good, but I kept waiting for him to move on to the next one. Ced came back out and said he lost some brothas in the audience. Even if they spoke Spanish, that joke was too long, but he did mention that there were a lot of Latinos in the audience so that may have been a smart move. In that performance, he may have created a bunch of new fans.While I watched the last two, an interview with Bill Cosby from ""Black Comedians: Why We Laugh"" kept coming to mind.Deray Davis: I like the look of him. He's gorgeous, but almost everything that comes out of his mouth is complaining about women, degrading women or just clowning them dead in their face. Somebody in the audience says she loves him, he said he loves her but not if she's a six. The comment about the girlfriend who he got to stand up in the audience was completely uncalled for, and I was looking at her boyfriend EXTRA crazy for laughing along. He spends FAR too much time using the b-word, bragging about cheating and just complaining. If you hate women so much, my gawd, PLEASE start dating men. Save the rest of us the complaining OR take your own advice and let your talking ""minutes"" expire, even on nights and weekends. (I did like him inJumping the Broom, but he managed to be the bitter one in that film, too.) Okay, I will admit I laughed at the Chris Brown joke, not the domestic violence part but the part when he broke out dancing. Now THAT was funny. I think Deray Davis is funny as long as I tune him out when he starts talking about women. As soon as he goes in that direction, I'm immediately repulsed by him.Aries Spears: Didn't have a clue who he was, but the audience CLEARLY knew him. I didn't laugh once. I was irritated when he called several sistas the b-word in the audience but the one white woman he spoke to, I'm pretty sure he called her ""woman"" or ""girl."" That says a helluva lot about his character. I was excited to see Nelly and Ashanti walk in during his performance, but that was about the only highlight. The rest? More Deray Davis style complaining and a terrible impersonation of DMX. He was good with Jay-Z though. I'll give him that.This DVD truly confirmed my style of comedy. For the record, my top five are Bill Cosby, Chris Rock, Wanda Sykes, Bernie Mac and Steve Harvey tied with Cedric the Entertainer, but there are a few others (like Sinbad, when he decides to resurface). I just can't chuckle at somebody trying to win Most Bitter Brotha Award.",2,"If not for Ced and Kevin Hart, it'd been 1 star",1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,3839,"[""'m"", 'hesitant', 'see', 'about', '95', '%', 'comedians', 'live', 'even', 'buy', 'products', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'hear', 'one', 'long', 'session', 'constantly', 'using', 'n-word', 'b-word', 'synonym', 'women', 'complaining', 'women', 'embarrassing', 'audience', 'members', 'talking', 'black', 'people', 'white', 'people', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'never', 'laugh', 'not', 'creative', 'are', 'comedians', 'absolutely', 'love', 'see', 'perform', 'then', 'other', '95', '%', 'could', 'stop', 'doing', 'jokes', 'tomorrow', ""'d"", 'volunteer', 'help', 'pack', 'up', 'did', 'give', 'DVD', 'shot', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'performances', '4', '5', 'end', 'DVD', 'dropped', '3', '5.', '1', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'Love', 'Everything', 'clean', 'sharp', 'comedy', 'clever', 'feel-good', 'funny', 'even', 'could', 'do', 'n-word.', '2', 'Kevin', 'Hart', 'fast', 'topping', 'last', 'top', 'five', 'seeingSeriously', 'Funny', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'like', ""n't"", 'just', 'rely', 'usual', 'suspects', 'be', 'funny', 'definitely', 'could', 'calm', 'down', 'b-word', ""'m"", 'somehow', 'not', 'offended', 'when', 'mainly', ""'ll"", 'call', 'one', 'Hard', 'be', 'offended', 'when', 'crack', 'jokes', 'yourself.', '3', 'Tommy', 'Davidson', 'can', 'take', 'small', 'doses', 'cool', 'always', 'little', 'extra', 'like', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'joke', 'Spanish', 'TV', 'Cops', 'jokes', 'were', 'good', 'kept', 'waiting', 'move', 'next', 'one', 'Ced', 'came', 'back', 'said', 'lost', 'brothas', 'audience', 'Even', 'spoke', 'Spanish', 'joke', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'did', 'mention', 'were', 'lot', 'Latinos', 'audience', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'smart', 'move', 'performance', 'may', 'have', 'created', 'bunch', 'new', 'fans.While', 'watched', 'last', 'two', 'interview', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Black', 'Comedians', 'Why', 'Laugh', 'kept', 'coming', 'mind.Deray', 'Davis', 'like', 'look', 'gorgeous', 'almost', 'everything', 'mouth', 'complaining', 'women', 'degrading', 'women', 'just', 'clowning', 'dead', 'face', 'Somebody', 'audience', 'said', 'not', 'six', 'comment', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'got', 'stand', 'up', 'audience', 'was', 'completely', 'uncalled', 'was', 'looking', 'boyfriend', 'EXTRA', 'crazy', 'laughing', 'along', 'FAR', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'using', 'b-word', 'bragging', 'cheating', 'just', 'complaining', 'hate', 'women', 'so', 'much', 'gawd', 'PLEASE', 'start', 'dating', 'men', 'Save', 'rest', 'complaining', 'OR', 'take', 'own', 'advice', 'let', 'talking', 'minutes', 'expire', 'even', 'nights', 'weekends', 'did', 'inJumping', 'Broom', 'managed', 'be', 'bitter', 'one', 'film', 'too', 'Okay', 'will', 'admit', 'laughed', 'Chris', 'Brown', 'joke', 'not', 'domestic', 'violence', 'part', 'part', 'when', 'broke', 'out', 'dancing', 'Now', 'was', 'funny', 'think', 'Deray', 'Davis', 'funny', 'as', 'long', 'tune', 'out', 'when', 'talking', 'women', 'As', 'soon', 'direction', ""'m"", 'immediately', 'repulsed', 'him.Aries', 'Spears', 'Did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'who', 'was', 'audience', 'CLEARLY', 'knew', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'once', 'was', 'irritated', 'when', 'called', 'several', 'sistas', 'b-word', 'audience', 'one', 'white', 'woman', 'spoke', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'called', 'woman', 'girl', 'helluva', 'lot', 'character', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'Nelly', 'Ashanti', 'walk', 'performance', 'was', 'only', 'highlight', 'rest', 'More', 'Deray', 'Davis', 'style', 'complaining', 'terrible', 'impersonation', 'DMX', 'was', 'good', 'Jay-Z', ""'ll"", 'give', 'that.This', 'DVD', 'truly', 'confirmed', 'style', 'comedy', 'record', 'top', 'five', 'are', 'Bill', 'Cosby', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Wanda', 'Sykes', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Steve', 'Harvey', 'tied', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'are', 'few', 'others', 'Sinbad', 'when', 'resurface', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'chuckle', 'somebody', 'trying', 'win', 'Most', 'Bitter', 'Brotha', 'Award']",All Star Comedy Jam 2009
