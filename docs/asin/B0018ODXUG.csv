Munro,"[11, 12]","If there were any errors in the movie, I didn't notice them -- I was engrossed in the chemistry between the two important leads -- the actor who plays Rene Angelil and the actress who played adult Celine. They did a great job at portraying a beautiful, passionate love story. Many doubted the sincerity of Celine & Rene's relationship, and they have persevered because of the strength of their love for each other.This movie begins with Celine Dion's childhood, the start of her singing in her family's pub ... and Michel Dion creating a demo and sending it to the then-manager of Genette Reno, Rene Angelil.  Rene listens to the demo and hears young Celine, then has her brought to his office.  After hearing her sing,  he agrees to represent her ... gambling on this young singer, and taking out a second mortgage on his house.  Celine was not a classically beautiful child (hey, Rene saw her in an awkward preteen phase!), with awkward teeth that forced the taunting nickname of ""Canine Dion.""  Young Celine flourishes as Rene mentors her into stardom.Flash forward eight years.  Celine is 20 and a young woman.  Rene is divorced.  After Celine Dion wins 1988 Euro Vision, a kiss changes everything forever ....The exact timeline of the songs didn't interest me, but the placement of various Celine Dion songs in the movie was very poignant.The epilogue shows Celine with her brand new hairstyle (short, blonde) performing ""My Heart Will Go On"" while her parents watch from backstage, standing beside Celine's husband Rene Angelil with baby Rene-Charles in his arms.  A previous reviewer incorrectly said that Celine's father had already died before the ""A New Day"" tour, however it is said by both Celine and Rene on ""Live in Las Vegas"" - A New Day DVD that the show was going on already ... and Celine performed a show on the very day her father died, a hard show to do and very emotional.  This movie wasn't supposed to be the ""E True Hollywood Story"" or a ""Lifetime Intimate Portrait.""  Just a movie ""inspired by her life"" as it said at the end. And one that is very well done.",4,Charming Celine Dion & Rene Angelil Love Story!,1235001600,"02 19, 2009",2009,2084,"['were', 'errors', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'was', 'engrossed', 'chemistry', 'two', 'important', 'leads', 'actor', 'who', 'Rene', 'Angelil', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'adult', 'Celine', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'beautiful', 'passionate', 'story', 'Many', 'doubted', 'sincerity', 'Celine', 'Rene', 'relationship', 'have', 'persevered', 'strength', 'love', 'other.This', 'movie', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'childhood', 'start', 'singing', 'family', 'pub', 'Michel', 'Dion', 'creating', 'demo', 'sending', 'then-manager', 'Genette', 'Reno', 'Rene', 'Angelil', 'Rene', 'demo', 'hears', 'young', 'Celine', 'then', 'brought', 'office', 'hearing', 'sing', 'represent', 'gambling', 'young', 'singer', 'taking', 'out', 'second', 'mortgage', 'house', 'Celine', 'was', 'not', 'classically', 'beautiful', 'child', 'hey', 'Rene', 'saw', 'awkward', 'preteen', 'phase', 'awkward', 'teeth', 'forced', 'taunting', 'nickname', 'Canine', 'Dion', 'Young', 'Celine', 'Rene', 'stardom.Flash', 'forward', 'eight', 'years', 'Celine', '20', 'young', 'woman', 'Rene', 'divorced', 'Celine', 'Dion', '1988', 'Euro', 'Vision', 'kiss', 'changes', 'everything', 'forever', '.The', 'exact', 'timeline', 'songs', 'did', ""n't"", 'interest', 'placement', 'various', 'Celine', 'Dion', 'songs', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'poignant.The', 'epilogue', 'shows', 'Celine', 'brand', 'new', 'hairstyle', 'short', 'blonde', 'performing', 'Heart', 'Will', 'Go', 'parents', 'watch', 'backstage', 'standing', 'beside', 'Celine', 'husband', 'Rene', 'Angelil', 'baby', 'Rene-Charles', 'arms', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'incorrectly', 'said', 'Celine', 'father', 'had', 'already', 'died', 'A', 'New', 'Day', 'tour', 'however', 'said', 'Celine', 'Rene', 'Live', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'New', 'Day', 'DVD', 'show', 'was', 'going', 'already', 'Celine', 'performed', 'show', 'very', 'day', 'father', 'died', 'hard', 'show', 'do', 'very', 'emotional', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'E', 'True', 'Hollywood', 'Story', 'Lifetime', 'Intimate', 'Portrait', 'movie', 'inspired', 'life', 'said', 'end', 'one', 'very', 'well', 'done']",Céline: Her Life Story

The only reason why fans should see this movie is to trash it later on.This movie gets EVERYTHING about Celine wrong. Simple things. They have Celine singing ""If You Asked Me To"" before she was signed with Sony. Before she ever came to the US. Before SHE KNEW ENGLISH!!! They have her NOT married to Rene when she's approached to sing ""My Heart Will Go On""!!!And another thing, according to this film, Celine always knew English and she doesn't have a French accent. The makers of this film said something like ""Language doesn't matter. Celine transcends language."" Umm...NO! Celine's FRENCH language music is a HUGE part of her career and it's COMPLETELY ignored in this movie!This movie is total trash.
