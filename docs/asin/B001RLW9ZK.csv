However, her talents are mostly wasted in WINTER OF FROZEN DREAMS. It starts out fine, w/ a murder and the ensuing cover-up. Unfortunately, things bog down in a big way, leaving Thora w/ little to do as the (rather bizarre) Barbara Hoffman. Keith Carradine's cop-near-retirement character isn't all that exciting, but then no one in this movie is very dynamic! I actually drifted into dreamland a few times, something I NEVER do when Ms. Birch is on screen! Alas, I re-watched it and found that I hadn't missed a thing...  P.S.- Don't even get me started on the mega-whimp played by Brendan Sexton III! His character was so spineless I could barely watch him!

Thora Birch delivers a terrific performance and I always enjoy Keith Carradine's acting. It's more than a little frightening to remember that this is based on a true story.,5,True story of Barbara Hoffman - serial killer,1240531200,"04 24, 2009",2009,272,"['had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'WOFD', 'advance', 'screening', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'well-made', 'film', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'terrific', 'performance', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'acting', 'more', 'little', 'frightening', 'remember', 'based', 'true', 'story']",Winter of Frozen Dreams

But this was a mess. One more quick thing, I notice people keep talking about her as a serial killer, but I though that took three murders, but anyway.Barbara Hoffman gets played decently by Thora Birch and Keith Carradine comes in to save the film (and the day) as the lead detective that helped bring this case to a close. Realizing this takes place in the 1970s, I wish they would have at least removed the 2000-era commercial truck, removed the 1990s props, or at least told the dead bodies to stop breathing for one take (I kept yelling at the screen saying he isn't dead...run!)The misplaced editing style of time jumping was poorly done, the sound was a train wreck, and my favorite actor of the film in Dean Winters had a minor role. But the cavalry was Mr. Carradine, and he is a joy to watch. If you skip the entire movie and just watch the special features interview with him, you will have not wasted a cent. The other features are mediocre, including a shorter behind the scenes, a ""Behind the Headlines"" snippet and an ""About the Author"" that both would make for a good intro to an American Justice episode, but little else.I felt disappointed when it was over, and so much more could have been done, but there were constraints and limits.",3,One performance can't raise the mediocrity above average,1241395200,"05 4, 2009",2009,1419,"['anyone', 'too', 'upset', 'yes', 'do', 'understand', 'issues', 'trials', 'make', 'independent', 'film', 'especially', 'such', 'sad', 'topic', 'black', 'widow', 'killer', 'was', 'mess', 'One', 'more', 'quick', 'thing', 'notice', 'people', 'keep', 'talking', 'about', 'serial', 'killer', 'though', 'took', 'three', 'murders', 'anyway.Barbara', 'Hoffman', 'played', 'decently', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Keith', 'Carradine', 'save', 'film', 'day', 'lead', 'detective', 'helped', 'bring', 'case', 'close', 'Realizing', 'place', '1970s', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'removed', '2000-era', 'commercial', 'truck', 'removed', '1990s', 'props', 'least', 'told', 'dead', 'bodies', 'stop', 'breathing', 'one', 'take', 'kept', 'yelling', 'screen', 'saying', ""n't"", 'dead', 'run', 'misplaced', 'editing', 'style', 'time', 'jumping', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', 'sound', 'was', 'train', 'wreck', 'favorite', 'actor', 'film', 'Dean', 'Winters', 'had', 'minor', 'role', 'cavalry', 'was', 'Mr.', 'Carradine', 'joy', 'watch', 'skip', 'entire', 'movie', 'just', 'watch', 'special', 'features', 'interview', 'will', 'have', 'not', 'wasted', 'cent', 'other', 'features', 'are', 'mediocre', 'including', 'shorter', 'scenes', 'Headlines', 'snippet', 'Author', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'intro', 'American', 'Justice', 'episode', 'little', 'else.I', 'felt', 'disappointed', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'were', 'constraints', 'limits']",Winter of Frozen Dreams
