1099983,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B000VAHR6Y,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[10, 10]","Border Caf&eacute;, filmed in 2005 in Iran portrays a widow's challenge to care for herself and her two children.  Her battle is with a culture that is not hers and a brother-in-law who fears dishonor.When her husband dies suddenly,  Reyhan is left with a caf&eacute; on the Turkish border.  Through familial and cultural obligations, her brother-in-law, Nasser demands that Reyhan become his second wife and he will provide financially.She resists their cultural traditions and  remains determined to become independent and raise the children.  She defies Nasser's request to build her a house with him.  And, she reopens her husband's caf&eacute; on the Turkish border.  She must remain in the background, in the kitchen while another employee waits tables.  The caf&eacute;, now a successful gathering place for truckers, competes with Nasser's restaurant closeby.The characters are very well-acted.  Nasser, always with a scowl on his face comes across as combative, frustrated, angry, and fearful of dishonoring his culture.  As with good character roles and portrayals, we learn to hate him.  The character Reyhan is sweet and we strive for her independence, as we want her to succeed against tradition, culture and authorities.  The movie was well-paced, and with its mild suspense, we wonder how often she can overcome those against her.Director and writer Kambozia Parvoti wanted to share his belief that people can communicate regardless of traditions and culture.  The film is about communication.  Reyhan communicates and bonds with a teen girl from Russia who is hiding out at the caf&eacute;.  Zakario, who is Greek communicates his desire for Reyhan even though they don't speak the same language.This film is provided by Global Film Initiative, which has brought exceptional films that have made significant impact.

1099984,A2BU4VOM170W1Y,B000VAHR6Y,A. Somers,"[1, 1]","Artful film about a woman whose husband passed away, leaving her their cafe on the Turkish border.Its central theme is the role of women in male dominated societies. Its heroine, Reyhan, has just become a widow, with two small children to take care of. Her deceased husband's brother Nasser, offers, in the local tradition of that part of Iran to look after her by taking her as his second wife. Reyhan, however, is very independent and, spurning Nasser's offer, decides instead to re open her husband's truck stop caf&eacute;. This puts her in direct competition with Nasser, who owns a much bigger truck stop restaurant. As her caf&eacute; builds up customers, the tension between her and Nasser rises particularly when a Greek truck driver takes a liking to Reyhan.What makes this movie stand out is Reyhan's skills cooking and the way it is conveyed to the audience. Great acting all around.
