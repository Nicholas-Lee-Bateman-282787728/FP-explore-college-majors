Walsh,"[1, 1]","As far as unauthorized band docs go, this one is pretty good because it has a mix of people who worked with VH before their rise to fame as well as being there at their peak. The interview with Stone, the bassist prior to Mike is worth watching to find out the reason why he left right when they were on the edge of stardom. There are interviews with VH (and some of their ""inner circle""), but obviously taken from other sources.  There's very little in the way of archive footage, and the only song they were able to get the rights to were ""Happy Trails"", but it's about their rise from a backyard party band to being a smash success, but the photos and flyers (and even a copy of the infamous ""no brown M&Ms;"" rider) are sufficient. And it goes into some of the reasons why Dave left (mostly through Mike and Alex's words.. but Dave and Valerie's books truly detailed the reasons why).If you want some of the blanks filled in, just read any of Ed's Guitar Player interviews, Dave's ""Crazy From the Heat"" and Valerie's ""Losing It"" books and put their music on. And there's plenty on You Tube as far as archive footage and the demos go. The band should put their own official documentary together while there are good feelings between Ed and Dave.It is worthwhile for someone starting in a band and a hardcore VH fan who gets a kick of seeing old photos.",3,Short but decent unauthorized doc on the early years,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",2008,1354,"['As', 'far', 'unauthorized', 'band', 'docs', 'go', 'one', 'pretty', 'good', 'mix', 'people', 'who', 'worked', 'VH', 'rise', 'fame', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'peak', 'interview', 'Stone', 'bassist', 'prior', 'Mike', 'worth', 'watching', 'find', 'out', 'reason', 'why', 'left', 'right', 'when', 'were', 'edge', 'stardom', 'are', 'interviews', 'VH', 'inner', 'circle', 'obviously', 'taken', 'other', 'sources', 'very', 'little', 'way', 'archive', 'footage', 'only', 'song', 'were', 'able', 'get', 'rights', 'were', 'Happy', 'Trails', 'rise', 'backyard', 'party', 'band', 'being', 'smash', 'success', 'photos', 'flyers', 'even', 'copy', 'infamous', 'brown', 'M', 'Ms', 'rider', 'are', 'sufficient', 'reasons', 'why', 'Dave', 'left', 'mostly', 'Mike', 'Alex', 'words..', 'Dave', 'Valerie', 'books', 'truly', 'detailed', 'reasons', 'why', '.If', 'want', 'blanks', 'filled', 'just', 'read', 'Ed', 'Guitar', 'Player', 'interviews', 'Dave', 'Crazy', 'Heat', 'Valerie', 'Losing', 'books', 'put', 'music', 'plenty', 'Tube', 'as', 'far', 'archive', 'footage', 'demos', 'go', 'band', 'should', 'put', 'own', 'official', 'documentary', 'together', 'are', 'good', 'feelings', 'Ed', 'Dave.It', 'worthwhile', 'someone', 'starting', 'band', 'hardcore', 'VH', 'fan', 'who', 'kick', 'seeing', 'old', 'photos']",N/A

Never heard before guitar solos, VH music all the way through.  What did I get?  About 15 seconds of poor quality camcorder recordings of them live.  Outdated poor quality interviews allegedly with Alex amd Michael.  Old television clips of Dave and Eddie when he was about to marry Valerie, and a load of useles information about there life on the road. Every rock band had this life on the road, there is nothing new about it!  Trashing the hotels etc,  The Who were doing this long before. Dave giving the roadies back passes for the girls (common fan knowledge for decades). On the upside, the makers tried on a limited amount of rights, and it's a start.  But there certainly isn't enough material in this DVD to produce a decent anthology of VH's early years (would realistically last for 3 hours).  Hopefully Warner Brothers will read these reviews and do something for the fans, cause if they do put the real article together I would gladly pay double the money!  If the input in this DVD was coupled with the music in the background and a little more live coverage then it would have been a lot better.",2,Could have been better.,1071964800,"12 21, 2003",2003,1215,"['What', 'expected', 'was', 'live', 'VH', 'footage', 'proper', 'interviews', 'Eddie', 'Alex', 'Dave', 'Michael', 'Never', 'heard', 'guitar', 'solos', 'VH', 'music', 'way', 'What', 'did', 'get', '15', 'seconds', 'poor', 'quality', 'camcorder', 'recordings', 'live', 'Outdated', 'poor', 'quality', 'interviews', 'allegedly', 'Alex', 'amd', 'Michael', 'Old', 'television', 'clips', 'Dave', 'Eddie', 'when', 'was', 'about', 'marry', 'Valerie', 'load', 'useles', 'information', 'life', 'road', 'Every', 'rock', 'band', 'had', 'life', 'road', 'nothing', 'new', 'Trashing', 'hotels', 'etc', 'Who', 'were', 'doing', 'long', 'before', 'Dave', 'giving', 'roadies', 'back', 'passes', 'girls', 'common', 'fan', 'knowledge', 'decades', 'upside', 'makers', 'tried', 'limited', 'amount', 'rights', 'start', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'enough', 'material', 'DVD', 'produce', 'decent', 'anthology', 'VH', 'early', 'years', 'would', 'realistically', 'last', '3', 'hours', 'Hopefully', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'will', 'read', 'reviews', 'do', 'something', 'fans', 'cause', 'do', 'put', 'real', 'article', 'together', 'would', 'gladly', 'pay', 'double', 'money', 'input', 'DVD', 'was', 'coupled', 'music', 'background', 'little', 'more', 'live', 'coverage', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better']",N/A
779235,A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N,B0000DJYPW,J. Lizzi,"[29, 30]","This is a documentary about one of the greatest rock bands ever, Van Halen, beginning with each member's early musical years and ending with the departure of David Lee Roth in 1985.  It's a cool story, augmented by lots of interesting photos and some rare film footage.  The finished product is unfortunately plagued by portions of bad sound and amateurish filming (alas, not as polished as VH-1's ""Behind the Music"") but with a run time of 70 minutes, there's a lot that's worth watching.The best part about the presentation of the Van Halen story is the diversity of people who were interviewed for this documentary:  childhood friends, fellow band members, other musicians, roadies, bodyguards, and record producers.  Some of their stories are outrageous (hey, it's rock 'n' roll after all!) and are thus a blast to contemplate.  Since the focus is strictly on the early years of the group, there was much I didn't know concerning who played in the original band, who did the early vocals (Eddie), how the guys met, and how Van Halen's stage act progressed and was influenced by David Lee (who adopted much of his stage persona from Black Oak Arkansas' ""Jim Dandy"" Mangrum, who appears on this disc!).Somewhat disappointing, you hear very little of the band's popular tunes (a snippet of ""Eruption"" does pop up at one point).  I'm guessing that this is because there may have been a copyright issue.  Another negative is that a significant portion of the commentary provided by Alex and Michael is via phone interview, and the sound leaves a bit to be desired.  Also, there's one part where Gene Simmons' voice is practically unintelligible due to poor sound quality.  Unfortunate perhaps, but it adds to the ""underground"" feel of the video.If you're a fan of Van Halen specifically (count me in), or great rock bands in general, see how this story compares to the others you know.  I'm hoping that there will more discs in this series to cover the rest of the band's history.",3,Focus on the very early years; satisfactory documentary,1094342400,"09 5, 2004",2004,1979,"['documentary', 'one', 'greatest', 'rock', 'bands', 'ever', 'Van', 'Halen', 'beginning', 'member', 'early', 'musical', 'years', 'ending', 'departure', 'David', 'Lee', 'Roth', '1985', 'cool', 'story', 'augmented', 'lots', 'interesting', 'photos', 'rare', 'film', 'footage', 'finished', 'product', 'unfortunately', 'plagued', 'portions', 'bad', 'sound', 'amateurish', 'filming', 'alas', 'not', 'as', 'polished', 'VH-1', 'Music', 'run', 'time', '70', 'minutes', 'lot', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'best', 'part', 'presentation', 'Van', 'Halen', 'story', 'diversity', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'childhood', 'friends', 'fellow', 'band', 'members', 'other', 'musicians', 'roadies', 'bodyguards', 'record', 'producers', 'stories', 'are', 'outrageous', 'hey', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'are', 'thus', 'blast', 'contemplate', 'focus', 'strictly', 'early', 'years', 'group', 'was', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'concerning', 'who', 'played', 'original', 'band', 'who', 'did', 'early', 'vocals', 'Eddie', 'how', 'guys', 'met', 'how', 'Van', 'Halen', 'stage', 'act', 'progressed', 'was', 'influenced', 'David', 'Lee', 'who', 'adopted', 'much', 'stage', 'persona', 'Black', 'Oak', 'Arkansas', 'Jim', 'Dandy', 'Mangrum', 'who', 'disc', 'disappointing', 'hear', 'very', 'little', 'band', 'popular', 'tunes', 'snippet', 'Eruption', 'pop', 'up', 'one', 'point', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'copyright', 'issue', 'negative', 'significant', 'portion', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Alex', 'Michael', 'phone', 'interview', 'sound', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'Also', 'one', 'part', 'where', 'Gene', 'Simmons', 'voice', 'practically', 'unintelligible', 'due', 'poor', 'sound', 'quality', 'Unfortunate', 'perhaps', 'underground', 'feel', 'video.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Van', 'Halen', 'specifically', 'count', 'great', 'rock', 'bands', 'general', 'see', 'how', 'story', 'others', 'know', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'more', 'discs', 'series', 'cover', 'rest', 'band', 'history']",N/A
