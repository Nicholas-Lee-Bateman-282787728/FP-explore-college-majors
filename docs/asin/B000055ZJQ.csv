They started with a perfectly good story, written by Rita Mae Brown and as part of her Mrs. Murphy mystery series, and changed it almost beyond total recognition.  These books are not great mysteries, but they are always charming, full of great character development, and quick to read.  The changes made in translating the story from the book to the screen were totally unnecessary, and especially jolting when you consider how many people have actually read the books.  Why the producers felt they had to change the story, change the characters and their backgrounds, and many other things is beyond comprehension.
