1667500,AILAB4OYB6HNI,B00EJSMOVW,KoneFire,"[0, 0]","This has the same issues has volume 2. Editing was poor on picture and sound. Especially in the opening credits. Although I love the show, it's to bad that this company did not take the same time that CBS did as I mentioned in the other review, when seasons 1 and , were released.. Also the vol 1 and 2 set-up is a rip. They could of made it all in one volume. Further, It's also annoying to see what  each episode is about when its behind the sleeve of the disk. You have to keep puling it up and down. Its starts to wear on the cover, and like to keep my discs in the original case. One last thing one of my discs dislodged, when the set arrived, which can cause damage to the disk, luckily nothing happened. They should have some folder things flops in to the keep the discs secure, as its to cumbersome to put discs back in forth. I do not want to keep handling discs. I do not need to handle. The cases holders are very cheap. I only give a three because of the issues mentioned. The show is a wonderful 5.
