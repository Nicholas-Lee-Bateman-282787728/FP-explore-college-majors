548538,AYMPVLWFKTAYE,B00004RF3V,"Erin K. Darling ""naive cynic""","[13, 13]","&quot;Wolves&quot; is a truly extraordinary look at some of the Yellowstone wolves and up-close portrayal of their complex social interactions. The producers and director did a wonderful job of getting very close to the wolves to bring them into our homes, and hopefully into our hearts, as we realize that these are not the Big Bad Wolves of European myth.The feature IMAX film itself is, sadly, very short; however, there is a wonderful additional film on the DVD, &quot;The Survival of the Wolf in Yellowstone&quot; that's simply outstanding. Narrated and hosted by Matthew Fox, featuring several noted wolf biologists and conservationists, and set largely in Yellowstone itself, this feature closely examines the many sides of wolf reintroduction, and prominently features some of the well-known wolves, most notably Numbers Nine and Ten, and their bittersweet stories.I definitely recommend watching this film and its accompanying features on the disc, as it will raise awareness of the wolf's struggles during the reintroduction process, and why it's so very important that we allow this magnificent, keystone predator back into its historic ranges.",4,Beautiful &amp; informative,1030924800,"09 2, 2002",2002,1155,"['quot', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'truly', 'extraordinary', 'look', 'Yellowstone', 'wolves', 'up-close', 'portrayal', 'complex', 'social', 'interactions', 'producers', 'director', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'getting', 'very', 'close', 'wolves', 'bring', 'homes', 'hopefully', 'hearts', 'realize', 'are', 'not', 'Big', 'Bad', 'Wolves', 'European', 'myth.The', 'feature', 'IMAX', 'film', 'sadly', 'very', 'short', 'however', 'wonderful', 'additional', 'film', 'DVD', 'quot', 'Survival', 'Wolf', 'Yellowstone', 'quot', 'simply', 'outstanding', 'Narrated', 'hosted', 'Matthew', 'Fox', 'featuring', 'several', 'noted', 'wolf', 'biologists', 'conservationists', 'set', 'largely', 'Yellowstone', 'feature', 'closely', 'many', 'sides', 'wolf', 'reintroduction', 'prominently', 'well-known', 'wolves', 'most', 'notably', 'Numbers', 'Nine', 'Ten', 'bittersweet', 'stories.I', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'accompanying', 'features', 'disc', 'will', 'raise', 'awareness', 'wolf', 'struggles', 'reintroduction', 'process', 'why', 'so', 'very', 'important', 'allow', 'magnificent', 'keystone', 'predator', 'back', 'historic', 'ranges']",N/A

However the documentary strays from it's premise. In certain segments, if someone walked in the room and did not know what the documentary was about, would never guess it was about wolves.

Maybe because I have a ""plain"" flat screen TV without high-def ... but the film had a border around it. I have watched other IMAX films without this distraction.I was disappointed so much time went to historical persecutions of wolves, but that is a dark part of american history: how the settlers/government persecuted Indians, wolves and buffalo to near extinction. One of our national disgraces, really. Not expected on a feature on ""wolves"".I have to allow for others who may not have been in nature conservation like I was, though.Maybe this will inspire someone to sponsor a wolf, and learn even more. the program is online, just search on google.I learned a few things about wolves, which is saying something for someone who studied to be a veterinarian!Shows how Nez Perce are helping reestablish wolves today.Worth a look. Not too violent for most kids, though there is footage of a hunter shooting a wolf at close range, in BW film.",4,Good content - great images - bad format,1206230400,"03 23, 2008",2008,1031,"['liked', 'production', 'logic', 'documentary', 'did', 'not', 'format', 'TV', 'Maybe', 'have', 'plain', 'flat', 'screen', 'TV', 'high-def', 'film', 'had', 'border', 'have', 'watched', 'other', 'IMAX', 'films', 'distraction.I', 'was', 'disappointed', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'went', 'historical', 'persecutions', 'wolves', 'dark', 'part', 'american', 'history', 'how', 'settlers/government', 'persecuted', 'Indians', 'wolves', 'buffalo', 'extinction', 'One', 'national', 'disgraces', 'really', 'Not', 'expected', 'feature', 'wolves', 'have', 'allow', 'others', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'nature', 'conservation', 'was', 'though.Maybe', 'will', 'inspire', 'someone', 'sponsor', 'wolf', 'learn', 'even', 'more', 'program', 'online', 'just', 'search', 'google.I', 'learned', 'few', 'things', 'wolves', 'saying', 'something', 'someone', 'who', 'studied', 'be', 'veterinarian', 'how', 'Nez', 'Perce', 'are', 'helping', 'reestablish', 'wolves', 'today.Worth', 'look', 'Not', 'too', 'violent', 'most', 'kids', 'footage', 'hunter', 'shooting', 'wolf', 'close', 'range', 'BW', 'film']",N/A
