Another big exception is he is completely and throughly wrong about the Bible being irrelevant.  The Bible tells the true stories extant throughout human history fraught with the Presence of GOD in the World, and HE who MADE IT!  But his criticisms of Religion are accurate and is the very feeling I get form reading the Gospels.  Jesus would be chagrined by what is being passed off as Religion.  Basically the Churches have become the modern version of the Medicine Shows of the 19th Century and Vaudeville of the late 19th and early 20th.
