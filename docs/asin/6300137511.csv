196316,A35X5JMZE3MPKY,6300137511,"Astral ""Astral""","[14, 14]","This is the second Unico theatrical feature about the unicorn who must keep moving along to keep away from the jealous gods who wish him to be exiled.  This movie is much darker and sinister in tone than the previous movie, and not enough time is spent on Unico himself.  The secondary characters are not as memorable as the original either, but this is still a solid movie, even though the darkness is rather surprising compared to fare nowadays.  A strange magician holds nothing but hatred in his heart for living creatures and wishes to collect them all as living puppets to build his magical castle.  He crosses Unico's path by way of a young girl he befriends, and the adventure is on from there...As for the DVD release itself.... hey!  It's Unico on DVD!  That's something we thought we'd never see in the first place!  Announced way back in 2007... it is finally here!  And it is in anamorphic widescreen, slightly cleaned up but the original grain left intact so it doesn't have that washed out appearance that some older movies have upon re-release.  The audio has suffered the most, as there is some crackling at the beginning especially but nothing too distracting.  The original dub is here and that's the main thing!ALSO! An added bonus!  The 1979 PILOT FILM (called ""Black Cloud, White Feather"" but just labeled as ""Pilot"") is in the extras!  It is subtitled only, but what a great special feature to have!  This was produced to be a pilot for a tv series that was never picked up (Unico went into theatrical production instead).  This was a great surprise and not something that was expected.  It can only be found on THIS DVD, and is NOT on The Fantastic Adventures of Unico.The pilot tells the story of a sickly girl named Chiko who has grown ill because of the smog surrounding her town.  It is being pumped out by a factory.  Delivering an ecological theme was the basis of the manga, and this sticks truer to it than the movies.A must buy for any Unico fan or unicorn lover.  Kids still love this movie, big and small.  Mine sure did enjoy it!  It's great to have childhood treasures like this to share with your family.  Unico never disappoints.",5,On DVD at last!!

Those mean gods taking a poor defenseless unicorn away from his loved ones and abandoning him. Then that evil bubble guy Kuruku comes along and turns everyone into living puppets and he has to save the world all on his own. But then... I watched it as an adult and I wondered... Did they INTEND this to be funny? Melvin is such a scaredy-cat it is ridiculous. Toby's hair and costume are just funny. The way lips move (this is true in all Anime as far as I've noticed). The sphinx in general. Mostly, the giant screeching dragon... rolling about on wheels.Well, none of that kept me from continuing to enjoy the movie. And I also ownThe Fantastic Adventures of Unico [VHS]. (That one I never managed to get a copy of until I was an adult. I was surprised by the violence in that one.)One thing I must mention: I absolutely love the flute melody Toby plays to bewitch the living puppets.

196326,A1N2E1GTHUSG7P,6300137511,Ryoko's Husband,"[0, 0]","Greetings;I loved this as a child, and I do to this day. This, the second Unico movie is my favorite of the two. this particular dvd has only English Audio, no subtitles. The words that drift on by at the beginning and the credits at the end too, all in Japanese, which was not how it appeared in the original english dubbed version from my childhood. Not a real problem, mind you. And as a lovely added bonus, you also get the original pilot-Unico was originally slated to be a TV show that never seemed to get off the ground. Honestly, I have to agree. The pilot episode kind of stank, in my opinion-just so under developed. The concept did much better as 90-ish minute movies. The cover art was decent enough, dual languages, Japanese and English. Printed on a sheet of paper that was altogether pretty thin. Not a huge problem, other then the fact that is looks crinkled even when its not. Seems to be typical of overseas productions, which is what I have to assume this to be. Altogether, not a bad deal and even better for the nostalgia. I always identified with Lord Kuruku. Never seemed to get along with people, but I could totally see myself living in a place built from the various living creatures of the world-people included. Hell, people especially.

Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and Gene Wilder's performance in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" are two examples of such ingenious films.""Unico in the Island of Magic"" is another movie that can capture audiences with its fairy-tale story and charming wit. This is from a time before the razor-sharp sarcastic media have to modernize fairy tales. (Remember ""Grimm Fairy Tales"" from Nickelodeon? That's the long-lost quality I still crave for.) This is Anime working at its best: creating worlds of children's imagination while providing interesting that amuse adults too.Our adorable noble magical unicorn has been dropped off near a quaint village that is soon to be attacked by a troublemaker. With the help of a plucky girl named Cheri, Unico must use his powers of love and friendship to stop the evil Kuruku and save the villagers. Brave little Unico's courage shines through in ways that sappiness does not and the film holds strength from start to finish.Cheri is straight and honest as Unico but some other less-than-perfect characters really flesh out the movie. Melvin Magnificat is a bullying feline whose massive ego is quickly deflated when he's recruited by Toby, Cheri's older brother, to do his master's dirty work. Toby is also interesting. He's a misguided magician with a strong thirst for magic but his conscience is torn between love for his family and love for his work. He is reluctant but must carry out his master's orders to a tee.The movie's plot revolved around the diabolical plans of Kuruku, a psychotic sorcerer who delights in turning humans into puppets and toys for his own amusement. With his bulging white eyes and a maniac high-pitched laugh, Kuruku ranks up there with the Joker's gleeful insanity. Yet he has a sympathetic side, as the audience learns that Kuruku was once a neglected puppet rejected by his masters.  Unico, ever the hero, pities Kuruku but must stand up to the fight and they battle as Kuruku's castle crumbles all around them.I enjoyed this movie even more than the first one because the story flows smoothly and the bewildering scenes are equally enchanting. A vast burning desert keeps Cheri and Unic from their destination. Human puppet-droids move like building blocks in time to Toby's eerie flute music. The toy dragon, with his whizzing, screaming, and snapping mouth, is witty and horrific. Cheri and Unico undergo a temporary transformation and dance for Kuruku's pleasure. Even decades later, this film remains a breathless wonder in the eye of every person who can imagine when dreams and stories come to life.",5,Wonderful and the Meaning of Magic,1181001600,"06 5, 2007",2007,2723,"['Classic', 'delights', 'children', 'toys', 'candy', 'can', 'be', 'twisted', 'garish', 'tales', 'horror', 'yet', 'hold', 'enthralled', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'Gene', 'Wilder', 'performance', 'Willy', 'Wonka', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'are', 'two', 'examples', 'such', 'ingenious', 'films', 'Unico', 'Island', 'Magic', 'movie', 'can', 'capture', 'audiences', 'fairy-tale', 'story', 'charming', 'wit', 'time', 'razor-sharp', 'sarcastic', 'media', 'have', 'modernize', 'fairy', 'tales', 'Remember', 'Grimm', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'Nickelodeon', 'long-lost', 'quality', 'still', 'crave', 'Anime', 'working', 'best', 'creating', 'worlds', 'children', 'imagination', 'providing', 'interesting', 'amuse', 'adults', 'too.Our', 'adorable', 'noble', 'magical', 'unicorn', 'been', 'dropped', 'off', 'quaint', 'village', 'soon', 'be', 'attacked', 'troublemaker', 'help', 'plucky', 'girl', 'named', 'Cheri', 'Unico', 'must', 'use', 'powers', 'love', 'friendship', 'stop', 'evil', 'Kuruku', 'save', 'villagers', 'Brave', 'little', 'Unico', 'courage', 'shines', 'ways', 'sappiness', 'not', 'film', 'strength', 'start', 'finish.Cheri', 'straight', 'honest', 'Unico', 'other', 'less-than-perfect', 'characters', 'really', 'flesh', 'out', 'movie', 'Melvin', 'Magnificat', 'bullying', 'feline', 'massive', 'ego', 'quickly', 'deflated', 'when', 'recruited', 'Toby', 'Cheri', 'older', 'brother', 'do', 'master', 'dirty', 'work', 'Toby', 'also', 'interesting', 'misguided', 'magician', 'strong', 'thirst', 'magic', 'conscience', 'torn', 'love', 'family', 'love', 'work', 'reluctant', 'must', 'carry', 'out', 'master', 'orders', 'tee.The', 'movie', 'plot', 'revolved', 'diabolical', 'plans', 'Kuruku', 'psychotic', 'sorcerer', 'who', 'turning', 'humans', 'puppets', 'toys', 'own', 'amusement', 'bulging', 'white', 'eyes', 'maniac', 'high-pitched', 'laugh', 'Kuruku', 'up', 'there', 'Joker', 'gleeful', 'insanity', 'sympathetic', 'side', 'audience', 'Kuruku', 'was', 'once', 'neglected', 'puppet', 'rejected', 'masters', 'Unico', 'ever', 'hero', 'pities', 'Kuruku', 'must', 'stand', 'up', 'fight', 'battle', 'Kuruku', 'castle', 'them.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'even', 'more', 'first', 'one', 'story', 'smoothly', 'bewildering', 'scenes', 'are', 'equally', 'enchanting', 'vast', 'burning', 'desert', 'keeps', 'Cheri', 'Unic', 'destination', 'Human', 'puppet-droids', 'move', 'building', 'blocks', 'time', 'Toby', 'eerie', 'flute', 'music', 'toy', 'dragon', 'whizzing', 'screaming', 'snapping', 'mouth', 'witty', 'horrific', 'Cheri', 'Unico', 'undergo', 'temporary', 'transformation', 'dance', 'Kuruku', 'pleasure', 'Even', 'decades', 'later', 'film', 'breathless', 'wonder', 'eye', 'person', 'who', 'can', 'imagine', 'when', 'dreams', 'stories', 'come', 'life']",Unico in the Island of Magic VHS
