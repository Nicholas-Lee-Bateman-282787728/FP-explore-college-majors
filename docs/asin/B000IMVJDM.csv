1021425,A17Q8HD4II7BE1,B000IMVJDM,"Amazon Customer ""Philip Ford""","[1, 1]","Walt Disney productions sought to block the release of this little hidden gem of a movie. It is not a perfect film but that resides in the problem of the director choosing bad film quality for this Alice which results in strange looking colors and sadly a bad print of an excellent film. It is almost the perfect Alice even though Carol Marsh is too old for the part she has an excellent singing voice and she acts well even though the characters are not there she is addressing. The animation is amusing and the characters funny. Much more of the whimsy and nonsense is in this version which is missing from others. Are the characters supposed to be disturbing in Carroll's novel ? In all honesty they should not be and unlike say Swankmejors excellent film the real story has much more humor which sometimes gets lost in some film versions ,however, in this version that humor is there and actually works. It should be noted though the queen of hearts in the original story never successfully beheads anyone which is part of the irony that in many versions the queen does behead her victims and in this film the threat seems to be real. What is sad about this film is that it is incomplete and needs to be restored fully.

1021428,A2RIRJJPGPMM8N,B000IMVJDM,Everyone's_a_critic,"[0, 0]","This is one in a series of reviews that will eventually be posted for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!This general commentary continues over in the review sections for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney (Alice in Wonderland (Masterpiece Edition)) and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (Alice in Wonderland). As these are the two most well known Alice's, rather then attempt to add yet-another-review for those two films, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon have a specific review for that title.Review of this 1950 version...Comparisons between this American-French production of Alice in Wonderland to its famous Disney contemporary are inevitable, but they are two very different approaches to the material. This movie is animated, but not in the cartoon style of the Disney production. It's a live action / animated hybrid with Carol Marsh (age 23 at the time) as the only live person in the ""Wonderland"" portion of the film (unless you count the pig). The other characters were what all the descriptions of the movie note as ""puppets"", although these are not hand puppets, nor are they marionettes. Rather they are film maker and puppet master Lou Bunin's moveable clay or rubber-like figures that are photographed in stop-motion sequences aka ""Gumby"" style.Alice's foray into Wonderland starts out in an interesting way that only a few ""Alice"" productions have undertaken; We are actually with Lewis Carroll (as Charles Dodgson) and his male companion as they row the three Liddell girls down river to a picnic spot, where Alice Liddell herself falls asleep and has her Alice in Wonderland experience. In a sort of a Wizard of Oz approach, all the humans Alice Liddell has been interacting with in daily life become voices for the characters in Wonderland. An opening title even states that Lewis Carroll drew his Wonderland characters from real people from his work life at Oxford. I liked this approach.Carol Marsh walks through a Wonderland built with 2-dimensional cardboard looking sets that pale in comparison to, say, the 2-dimensional looking sets in the 1933 version with Cary Grant. But Alice and the animals she meets bring the sets to life nicely. Marsh is perhaps an adequate singer, but a very good dancer. Watch for her short dance after singing the Father William song for the caterpillar. She is obviously trained in ballet, and it was a pleasure to watch her moves (I was reading a description of the movie on IMDB.com and it was noted that Carol actually free fell 30' to a net in order to pull off the falling down the rabbit hole sequence. She was offered a double but chose to perform the fall herself. There are several other interesting notes on the film at IMDB).So, yes, this is a fun film. A lot of work went into animating the puppets, and a few of the sequences such as the court scene when all the characters break out in song are a real delight. Be prepared to view a notably deteriorated print however. The film is not well preserved. But it's absolutely worth a view although I think adults will enjoy the movie more so than children. There are several Alice versions far more kid friendly than this one though. Note: They took as many liberties with the story here as Disney did with its production.(Speaking of stop-motion photography, there are some other Alice movies shot in this same manner. One production is from famous stop-motion film maker Jan Svankmajer made in 1988 (Alice). It's a dark, creepy, even morbid [adults only] telling of the Alice tale. Also, several amateur shorts can be found on YouTube.

He was very proud of this film, and rueful regarding the circumstances which kept it from wider release. In our class, Bunin ran a beautiful 16mm print of his ""Alice"" that was superior to the copy on this DVD. How unfortunate that the original colors and crispness are lost. This DVD version has no chapter stops, special features, interviews, or commentary. Too bad; it's a film that could have used them. For animators and fans of stop motion, I'd say take a look, and at least the price is lower than the usual. But even for devotees of the ""Alice"" stories, the film itself can be dense and off-putting, in that it faithfully recreates the arch cynicism and curious aloofness of the original story. This film cries out for a loving restoration: sadly, this isn't it, but it may be the only way to see Bunin's ""Alice"" for the time being.
