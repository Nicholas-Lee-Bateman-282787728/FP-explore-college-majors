After I found out the cost to make it was $4,000, I thought, wow what a great movie for so little money.  I watched it again and - boy do I love this movie.  The story is great.  I listened closely to what they were talking about, rather than focusing my attention on the paperweight skeletons.  This is a love it or hate it movie, many will hate, but I got past that, and now I even love the cheap scenery and special effects.  The score is magnificent - reminds me of John Carpenter's Vampires score.  Plus - I love Kane Hodder.",4,NOT BAD AFTER WATCHING TWICE,1232409600,"01 20, 2009",2009,632,"['got', 'preview', 'movie', 'supermarket', 'dvd', 'hated', 'only', 'was', 'so', 'cheaply', 'made', 'found', 'out', 'cost', 'make', 'was', '4,000', 'thought', 'wow', 'what', 'great', 'movie', 'so', 'little', 'money', 'watched', 'again', 'boy', 'do', 'love', 'movie', 'story', 'great', 'listened', 'closely', 'what', 'were', 'talking', 'rather', 'focusing', 'attention', 'paperweight', 'skeletons', 'love', 'hate', 'movie', 'many', 'will', 'hate', 'got', 'past', 'now', 'even', 'love', 'cheap', 'scenery', 'special', 'effects', 'score', 'magnificent', 'John', 'Carpenter', 'Vampires', 'score', 'love', 'Kane', 'Hodder']",Dead Noon

Greatone ""I piss greatness""","[2, 4]","I bought this used, which i recommend if you want a good laugh, not as much as ""Zomieland"" good laugh, but more like...... hey I have a zombie movie plot and I know how to create flames on my fancy computer (the flames where horrible) lets get some of my college buddies and one hot girl (deputys wife) that would definetly look out of place, and make a movie.  This movie made me wish I had to take a massive dump, so I would'nt have to push pause knowing I have come back and push play eventually.  I love zombie movies, I watch them with the bar set pretty low, low budget, lack of talent when it comes to acting and etc. But I should have known this movies was going to be waste of time by looking at the main menu, it looked cheeeeeeeeesssssy!(I added the extra ""E""s so you would have a slight idea, but I fore worn you theres still room for more) I did not bother finishing the movie but instead I watched Austin City Limits on pbs, K'naan and Mos Def were performing.  YOU SEE EVEN WRITING THIS REVIEW ABOUT THE DEAD NOON, IM STILL GETTING SIDE TRACKED.  The movie was confusing, at first you think there in the desert than theres rednecks with shotguns that would rather shoot first before they even know whats going on, so of course they die.  Theres a seen than had laughing only because it didnt make sense, a scene starts off with a car parked on the side of the road and a random no named character says ""Dude im starving, lets get a taco"" but instead of starting the car, they get get out and pop the hood as if their car is broken down, and when one of the demon zombie things walks up to them, one guys asks ""hey you think you help?"" then the demon zombie thing cocks his gun, and the guy takes off running, leaving you the viewer like ""wtf""... Long story short dont buy this movie with high hopes... Or average ...hopes?....Or low.... Or just watch pbs",1,I turned it and watched pbs instead. wtf,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",2010,1869,"['bought', 'used', 'i', 'recommend', 'want', 'good', 'laugh', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'Zomieland', 'good', 'laugh', 'more', 'hey', 'have', 'zombie', 'movie', 'plot', 'know', 'how', 'create', 'flames', 'fancy', 'computer', 'flames', 'where', 'horrible', 'get', 'college', 'buddies', 'one', 'hot', 'girl', 'deputys', 'wife', 'would', 'definetly', 'look', 'place', 'make', 'movie', 'movie', 'made', 'wish', 'had', 'take', 'massive', 'dump', ""would'nt"", 'have', 'push', 'pause', 'knowing', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'push', 'play', 'eventually', 'love', 'zombie', 'movies', 'watch', 'bar', 'set', 'pretty', 'low', 'low', 'budget', 'lack', 'talent', 'when', 'acting', 'etc', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'movies', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'looking', 'main', 'menu', 'looked', 'cheeeeeeeeesssssy', 'added', 'extra', 'E', 's', 'would', 'have', 'slight', 'idea', 'fore', 'worn', 'theres', 'still', 'room', 'more', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'finishing', 'movie', 'instead', 'watched', 'Austin', 'City', 'Limits', 'pbs', ""K'naan"", 'Mos', 'Def', 'were', 'performing', 'SEE', 'EVEN', 'WRITING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'THE', 'DEAD', 'NOON', 'IM', 'STILL', 'GETTING', 'SIDE', 'TRACKED', 'movie', 'was', 'confusing', 'first', 'think', 'desert', 'theres', 'rednecks', 'shotguns', 'would', 'rather', 'shoot', 'first', 'even', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'course', 'die', 'seen', 'had', 'laughing', 'only', 'make', 'sense', 'scene', 'car', 'parked', 'side', 'road', 'random', 'named', 'character', 'Dude', 'im', 'starving', 'get', 'taco', 'instead', 'starting', 'car', 'get', 'get', 'out', 'pop', 'hood', 'car', 'broken', 'down', 'when', 'one', 'demon', 'zombie', 'things', 'walks', 'up', 'one', 'guys', 'hey', 'think', 'help', 'then', 'demon', 'zombie', 'thing', 'cocks', 'gun', 'guy', 'running', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'wtf', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'dont', 'buy', 'movie', 'high', 'hopes', 'average', '.Or', 'low', 'just', 'watch', 'pbs']",Dead Noon

The first five minutes were well done and fairly interesting, but then when the flashbacks appeared on the screen, the awful suckiness of this movie was brutally manifest. Since the budget for this film was only $4,000, the only ""trick"" they had to use to create the flashback to the Western age of the 1800s was to overdevelop the film until everything is in a very harsh white color. This ""so-called effect"" does NOT work! It was very jarring to look at the screen like this. Then the awful ""acting"" of the unknown characters immediately became apparent when they opened their mouths to speak, and each of them became VERY ANNOYING to watch. After struggling to stick with this film for about 15 minutes, I finally jerked it out of my DVD in disgust and threw it hard into the trash.Don't waste your time on this huge DUD of a film.",1,A piece of crap!,1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,932,"['When', 'initially', 'saw', 'three', 'stars', 'rating', 'DVD', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'try', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'were', 'well', 'done', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'then', 'when', 'flashbacks', 'appeared', 'screen', 'awful', 'suckiness', 'movie', 'was', 'brutally', 'manifest', 'budget', 'film', 'was', 'only', '4,000', 'only', 'trick', 'had', 'use', 'create', 'flashback', 'Western', 'age', '1800s', 'was', 'overdevelop', 'film', 'everything', 'very', 'harsh', 'white', 'color', 'so-called', 'effect', 'NOT', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'jarring', 'look', 'screen', 'Then', 'awful', 'acting', 'unknown', 'characters', 'immediately', 'became', 'apparent', 'when', 'opened', 'mouths', 'speak', 'became', 'VERY', 'ANNOYING', 'watch', 'struggling', 'stick', 'film', '15', 'minutes', 'finally', 'jerked', 'DVD', 'disgust', 'threw', 'hard', 'trash.Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'huge', 'DUD', 'film']",Dead Noon

The acting is as wooden as you'd expect for these kinds of films, so director Wiest wisely forgoes lengthy exposition and those annoying character speeches that are meant to be supposedly self-revealing for said character, and goes straight for the chase.  There are lots of pretty decent well choreographed chase and gun fight scenes.  Yes, the skeletons are a little tough to watch without smirking, but the fiery cowboy who shoots bullets of hellfire that incinerate his victims was BRILLIANT.  In all, Dead Noon does a great job synthesizing cowboy mythology and old-west clich&eacute;s and giving it a semi-modern twist.  Case and point-the excellent music for the film.  As for the bizarre review that compared this film to bad acting in a porno, I've never watched porn so I wouldn't know about porn acting, but it's pretty obvious that that review knows what he likes and likes what he knows---and should stick with that.",3,Fair to middlin' noon,1270339200,"04 4, 2010",2010,1035,"['Let', 'get', 'obvious', 'way', 'first', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'what', 'low', 'budget', 'acting', 'as', 'wooden', ""'d"", 'expect', 'kinds', 'films', 'so', 'director', 'Wiest', 'wisely', 'lengthy', 'exposition', 'annoying', 'character', 'speeches', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'supposedly', 'self-revealing', 'said', 'character', 'straight', 'chase', 'are', 'lots', 'pretty', 'decent', 'well', 'choreographed', 'chase', 'gun', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Yes', 'skeletons', 'are', 'little', 'tough', 'watch', 'smirking', 'fiery', 'cowboy', 'who', 'bullets', 'hellfire', 'incinerate', 'victims', 'was', 'BRILLIANT', 'Dead', 'Noon', 'great', 'job', 'synthesizing', 'cowboy', 'mythology', 'old-west', 'clich', 'eacute', 'giving', 'semi-modern', 'twist', 'Case', 'point-the', 'excellent', 'music', 'film', 'bizarre', 'review', 'compared', 'film', 'bad', 'acting', 'porno', ""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'porn', 'acting', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'review', 'what', 'what', '-and', 'should', 'stick']",Dead Noon

They start killing anything at random with bullets that burn people alive.The special effects are not good. There are a lot of pauses in the dialogue. I don't mean the William Shatner overly frequent dramatic pauses, but the deer in the headlight pauses one has in order to attempt to gather their thoughts because they forgot their lines or some guy off camera fell asleep while moving the cards.
