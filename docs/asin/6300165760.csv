Not only does it cover the plot, it shows all the awful scenes that made the first one so bad.This time out, adult Ricky is talking to a psychiatrist about his Santa dressing killer brother Billy in a mental hospital. It seems Ricky has a good memory, since he repeats scenes that neither him or his brother witnessed, and the film makers change the plot of the first film to suit their needs. Ricky also seems to have taken some classes on how to play a character completely wrong. His scenes with the psychiatrist are terrible.Ricky kills the psychiatrist and escapes to take revenge on the first film's Mother Superior character. Ricky is set into murderous rages by the color red...you know that color, you probably go days on end without ever seeing it. I would hate to see Ricky's reaction at a four way stop intersection.Ricky dresses like Santa, and begins hacking and killing. In the end, two bullets and a shotgun blast send him through a plate glass window, but he seems to survive, appearing in the next sequel.

With worse acting than Troll 2, a plot so derivative that half its run time is footage from the original, a series of gratuitous rape scenes and buckets of bloodshed, this is precisely the kind of movie I'd have been looking for at 3AM on Cinemax during my adolescence. Lead actor Eric Freeman utters nothing but awful catchphrases from start to finish, delivered with the kind of wild-eyed sincerity that left me wondering how blurry the line between fact and fiction really was for the filmmakers. In comparison to Freeman's scene-stealing ineptitude, the rest of the cast fades helplessly into the wallpaper - and that's probably for the best.

I heard of it only because of the legendary ""Garbage Day!"" youtube meme and I went ahead and watched the first one. I didn't particularly like it and found many scenes hilarious due to poor acting and idiotic dialogue, but all the bad from that movie truly can not hold a candle to how atrocious everything in this movie is. Oddly enough, while this movie by no means falls into the so-bad-it's-good category of movies; it's so horrible, I actually enjoyed watching it more than the first one.The plot is essentially the entire first movie with new scenes to actually make this film it's own movie. While the scenes are slightly abridged you will feel like you just watched the first movie.Eric Freeman plays Ricky, the deranged brother of the equally deranged Billy from the first movie. Ricky is incarcerated and as the movie opens he (attempts to) stare(s) menacingly into the camera. Freeman is incapable of looking natural while doing something and even holding a cigarette seems like a challenge. A psychiatrist named Bloom interviews Ricky about his view of the events leading up to his incarceration, including the events of the first movie, of course and his first meeting/courtship with Jennifer (Elizabeth Cayton).Is a plot description necessary? No, not at all, but I thought I'd fill you in. As the film is essentially one long flashback, it seems pointless to even mention the hilarious attempt at continuity, specifically when Ricky narrates events he couldn't know about. And the plotting is ridiculous (obviously) such as a scene where Ricky and Jennifer go to see a movie...Which ends up being the first movie.The dialogue in this movie is beyond any definition of idiotic. It's so poor, in fact, I had trouble believing it could be made worse by it's delivery...But it is. Besides ""garbage day"" and Jennifer's line to an ex-boyfriend (""...you cheated on me, you ruined my best sweater), there's also this Oscar-worthy exchange:Mother Superior-""You're being naughty!""Ricky-""Naughty this!""Finally, Ricky's walk through suburbia (where the ""garbage day"" scene occurs) is one of the funniest, most poorly executed sequences committed to celluloid. Even worse is that we're to assume the filmmakers intended to frighten the audience.Is there anything good about this movie? No, not technically. However, I found Cayton gorgeous and there is an Oscar-worthy uncredited performance in this movie...Eric Freeman's eyebrows. You'll know what I mean moments after this movie begins. They're absolutely fascinating.This is a hard movie critique, because quite frankly it's one of the worst films ever made. This movie features the very definition of bad acting, bad writing, and bad filmmaking. However, if you're bored and have 88 minutes to waste you'll likely be entertained as it is entertaining because of how bad it is. So, I give it 2 stars because it really can't be awarded 3 and a 1-star rating simply brands it unwatchable.",2,One of the Worst Films Ever Made...Also Hilariously Funny.,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",2009,3066,"['world', 'filled', 'Z-grade', 'bottom-rung', 'movies', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', 'Part', '2', 'one', 'most', 'fascinating', 'heard', 'only', 'legendary', 'Garbage', 'Day', 'meme', 'went', 'ahead', 'watched', 'first', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'found', 'many', 'scenes', 'hilarious', 'due', 'poor', 'acting', 'idiotic', 'dialogue', 'bad', 'movie', 'truly', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'how', 'atrocious', 'everything', 'movie', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'movie', 'means', ""so-bad-it's-good"", 'category', 'movies', 'so', 'horrible', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'more', 'first', 'one.The', 'plot', 'essentially', 'entire', 'first', 'movie', 'new', 'scenes', 'actually', 'make', 'film', 'own', 'movie', 'scenes', 'are', 'slightly', 'abridged', 'will', 'feel', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'movie.Eric', 'Freeman', 'Ricky', 'deranged', 'brother', 'equally', 'deranged', 'Billy', 'first', 'movie', 'Ricky', 'incarcerated', 'movie', 'attempts', 'stare', 'menacingly', 'camera', 'Freeman', 'incapable', 'looking', 'natural', 'doing', 'something', 'even', 'holding', 'cigarette', 'challenge', 'psychiatrist', 'named', 'Bloom', 'interviews', 'Ricky', 'view', 'events', 'leading', 'up', 'incarceration', 'including', 'events', 'first', 'movie', 'course', 'first', 'meeting/courtship', 'Jennifer', 'Elizabeth', 'Cayton', 'plot', 'description', 'necessary', 'No', 'not', 'thought', ""'d"", 'fill', 'film', 'essentially', 'one', 'long', 'flashback', 'pointless', 'even', 'mention', 'hilarious', 'attempt', 'continuity', 'specifically', 'when', 'Ricky', 'events', 'could', ""n't"", 'know', 'about', 'plotting', 'ridiculous', 'obviously', 'such', 'scene', 'where', 'Ricky', 'Jennifer', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'Which', 'up', 'being', 'first', 'movie.The', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'definition', 'idiotic', 'so', 'poor', 'fact', 'had', 'trouble', 'believing', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'worse', 'delivery', 'garbage', 'day', 'Jennifer', 'line', 'ex-boyfriend', 'cheated', 'ruined', 'best', 'sweater', 'also', 'Oscar-worthy', 'exchange', 'Superior-', ""'re"", 'being', 'naughty', 'Ricky-', 'Naughty', 'Finally', 'Ricky', 'walk', 'suburbia', 'where', 'garbage', 'day', 'scene', 'occurs', 'one', 'funniest', 'most', 'poorly', 'executed', 'sequences', 'committed', 'celluloid', 'Even', 'worse', ""'re"", 'assume', 'filmmakers', 'intended', 'frighten', 'audience.Is', 'there', 'anything', 'good', 'movie', 'No', 'not', 'technically', 'However', 'found', 'Cayton', 'gorgeous', 'Oscar-worthy', 'uncredited', 'performance', 'movie', 'Eric', 'Freeman', 'eyebrows', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'moments', 'movie', ""'re"", 'absolutely', 'fascinating.This', 'hard', 'movie', 'critique', 'quite', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'movie', 'very', 'definition', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'writing', 'bad', 'filmmaking', 'However', ""'re"", 'bored', 'have', '88', 'minutes', 'waste', ""'ll"", 'likely', 'be', 'entertained', 'entertaining', 'how', 'bad', 'So', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'awarded', '3', '1-star', 'rating', 'simply', 'unwatchable']","Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 VHS"

This movie was only about flashbacks. Most of them were from the first SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, and the rest were Ricky's flashbacks that had nothing to do with Christmas. The only part of the film that had something to do with Christmas was the ending, when Ricky broke out of the mental hospital.Sure this movie was like two sequels in one, but were we warned that there was? No. If I knew this film was only about flashbacks from the first one, I may have rented it on a two-for-one night. This sequel could have been like the FRIDAY THE 13TH films. What I mean is, in the first FRIDAY THE 13TH, Jason's mother was the killer. In the first SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT, Ricky's brother was the killer. Unlike FRIDAY THE 13TH, the makers of SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT messed up their series horribly. They only needed at least five minutes of flashbacks for their sequel.Eventhough this movie was boring, there are some funny scenes. The scene in the movie theatre was quite funny. And as if we didn't see enough flashbacks, the movie being played in the theatre was SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT.If you want to see a good horror movie that has something to do with Christmas, then check out the first SILENT NIGHT, DEADLY NIGHT or BLACK CHRISTMAS.I hope my review was helpful to you!",1,Enough With The Flashbacks!,1005004800,"11 6, 2001",2001,1507,"['Confined', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Ricky', 'driven', 'horrible', 'memory', 'parent', 'death', 'forced', 'relive', 'violent', 'actions', 'brother', 'explodes', 'frenzy', 'murder', 'mayhem.Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'synopsis', 'fool', 'movie', 'was', 'only', 'flashbacks', 'Most', 'were', 'first', 'SILENT', 'NIGHT', 'DEADLY', 'NIGHT', 'rest', 'were', 'Ricky', 'flashbacks', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Christmas', 'only', 'part', 'film', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Christmas', 'was', 'ending', 'when', 'Ricky', 'broke', 'mental', 'hospital.Sure', 'movie', 'was', 'two', 'sequels', 'one', 'were', 'warned', 'was', 'No', 'knew', 'film', 'was', 'only', 'about', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'rented', 'two-for-one', 'night', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', 'films', 'What', 'mean', 'first', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', 'Jason', 'mother', 'was', 'killer', 'first', 'SILENT', 'NIGHT', 'DEADLY', 'NIGHT', 'Ricky', 'brother', 'was', 'killer', 'FRIDAY', 'THE', '13TH', 'makers', 'SILENT', 'NIGHT', 'DEADLY', 'NIGHT', 'messed', 'up', 'series', 'horribly', 'only', 'needed', 'least', 'five', 'minutes', 'flashbacks', 'sequel.Eventhough', 'movie', 'was', 'boring', 'are', 'funny', 'scenes', 'scene', 'movie', 'theatre', 'was', 'quite', 'funny', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'enough', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'being', 'played', 'theatre', 'was', 'SILENT', 'NIGHT', 'DEADLY', 'NIGHT.If', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'horror', 'movie', 'something', 'do', 'Christmas', 'then', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'SILENT', 'NIGHT', 'DEADLY', 'NIGHT', 'BLACK', 'CHRISTMAS.I', 'hope', 'review', 'was', 'helpful']","Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 VHS"

I counted almost half a dozen five star reviews on the first page alone, and it averages at around 3. What have you people been smoking, and why aren't you sharing it?The acting in this thing is putrid, especially on the part of Eric Freeman, who plays the kid brother of Billy from the first film. His acting  was so horrible I had to get up in the middle of the film and go into the bathroom to empty my bowels, because I had an attack of diarrhea. He doesn't look like he's acting at all, really. It looks more like he's trying to pass a gall stone. I'm an actor, myself. So, I think I have the right to say that I wouldn't spare this kid a drop of piss if he was on fire.In this film we reunite with Ricky (Eric Freeman), Billy's little brother. He has apparently been incarcerated in a state mental hospital for killing a bunch of people. In the first scenes, and in a collection of tiresome flashbacks from the first film, Ricky reveals to a prison Psychiatrist why he did the things he did. He tells the story of his parents murder, and his older brother's subsequent nervous breakdown, as an adult. If you are already fed up with Ricky's whining, and long for the original film, don't you worry. They show clips from it for almost two thirds of this one. When finally we see what Ricky, himself, got into trouble for, we are treated to a number of lame scenes in which he runs amok with a pistol and kills several people in a quiet neighborhood. No axe for Ricky. Oh, no! That would be too sensational. No, just a good old .357 magnum. Not quite like Dirty Harry, but close enough.As you may have guessed, Ricky eventually escapes from the mental hospital, and goes after Mother Superior from the first film. (I think it's a different actress, but I couldn't tell, her makeup was too thick.) You can probably predict what happens next, but I make it a rule not to blow the ending of any movie, even when the film deserves it. Suffice to say that Ricky dons his own Santa Claus outfit, the way his brother did in the first movie, when he takes care of businessSo, there you have it. That's Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2. In my humble opinion they took a good idea and wasted it. It was overkill. I think it would have been way cooler if they had just had the original actor from the first film come back as a zombie Santa Claus to continue on his original path of destruction. That would have been much easier to take than this miserable product.",1,Not worth a pig's spit.,1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2560,"['god', 'what', 'people', 'am', 'shocked', 'appalled', 'film', 'got', 'so', 'many', 'good', 'reviews', 'counted', 'almost', 'dozen', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'first', 'page', 'alone', '3', 'What', 'have', 'people', 'been', 'smoking', 'why', 'are', ""n't"", 'sharing', 'acting', 'thing', 'putrid', 'especially', 'part', 'Eric', 'Freeman', 'who', 'kid', 'brother', 'Billy', 'first', 'film', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'had', 'get', 'up', 'middle', 'film', 'go', 'bathroom', 'empty', 'bowels', 'had', 'attack', 'diarrhea', ""n't"", 'look', 'acting', 'really', 'more', 'trying', 'pass', 'gall', 'stone', ""'m"", 'actor', 'So', 'think', 'have', 'right', 'say', 'would', ""n't"", 'spare', 'kid', 'drop', 'piss', 'was', 'fire.In', 'film', 'reunite', 'Ricky', 'Eric', 'Freeman', 'Billy', 'little', 'brother', 'apparently', 'been', 'incarcerated', 'state', 'mental', 'hospital', 'killing', 'bunch', 'people', 'first', 'scenes', 'collection', 'tiresome', 'flashbacks', 'first', 'film', 'Ricky', 'prison', 'Psychiatrist', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'did', 'story', 'parents', 'murder', 'older', 'brother', 'subsequent', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'adult', 'are', 'already', 'fed', 'up', 'Ricky', 'whining', 'long', 'original', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'show', 'clips', 'almost', 'two', 'thirds', 'one', 'When', 'finally', 'see', 'what', 'Ricky', 'got', 'trouble', 'are', 'treated', 'number', 'lame', 'scenes', 'amok', 'pistol', 'several', 'people', 'quiet', 'neighborhood', 'axe', 'Ricky', 'Oh', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'sensational', 'No', 'just', 'good', 'old', '.357', 'magnum', 'Not', 'quite', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'close', 'may', 'have', 'guessed', 'Ricky', 'eventually', 'mental', 'hospital', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'first', 'film', 'think', 'different', 'actress', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'makeup', 'was', 'too', 'thick', 'can', 'probably', 'predict', 'what', 'next', 'make', 'rule', 'not', 'blow', 'ending', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Ricky', 'dons', 'own', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'outfit', 'way', 'brother', 'did', 'first', 'movie', 'when', 'care', 'businessSo', 'have', 'Silent', 'Night', 'Deadly', 'Night', 'Part', '2', 'humble', 'opinion', 'took', 'good', 'idea', 'wasted', 'was', 'overkill', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'cooler', 'had', 'just', 'had', 'original', 'actor', 'first', 'film', 'come', 'back', 'zombie', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'continue', 'original', 'path', 'destruction', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'easier', 'take', 'miserable', 'product']","Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2 VHS"
