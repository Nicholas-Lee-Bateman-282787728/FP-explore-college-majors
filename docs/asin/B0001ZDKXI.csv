All I can say is that I a really excited about this release. I am a huge fan of the show and my one regret is that I got on the boat late. The summewr of the original survivor was a turbulent one for me and I never got in on the action until late in the season. Now, when I discuss the show I always have to take a back seat when the events of season one are brought up. The release of the ""highlights"" DVD was not enough. Now, I will happily be able to view the season in its entirety, on a high quality DVD format loaded with extra's. So, I must say thank you to the producers for finally seeing the light on this needed release for fans of the show. Although I would have rather this release come before the airing of the All Star edition, I will gladly be one of the first to add this to my collection. And stay tune for my actual review when I finally get to view the product.So I finally got my copy, ran home and popped the first DVD into the player.  So this was the beginning of the adventure. What really shocked me at first is how different the show seemed. Everything from the camera styles and lighting seemed to come from a different place than the later seasons of the show. Jeff himself was no where near as polished, often stumbling over his now famous catch phrases. Not that I am complaining. There is a real raw and exciting feel to this edition. I got to meet such interesting characters as B.B. the crotchety old work horse and Ramona, whose queasy stomach in the early going may have cost her. My only qualm so far with the box set is the fact that they have listed who was voted off on each episode on the back of the box in the episode description. While I know a lot of the basics of what happened, it still would have been cool to keep a little suspense going for those of us who never saw the premiere episode.

Except in the case of reality shows where the asymptote is bypassed and we have met perfection.  Here, 100% of everything is crap.  Reality programming is a vacuum in which quality cannot exist.Reality shows have done the same thing for television that HIV does for the immune system - renders it diseased, depleted, and ultimately useless.  Survivor may not have been the first of these cultural and intellectual parasites, but it blew the door wide open for quadrillions of other shows of its ilk.  To make matters worse, it introduced the world to Johnny Fairplay and Richard Hatch (and not the cool guy from Battlestar Galactica who is gracious with his fans).  For that, Mark Burnette needs to be tried for crimes against humanity.One more gripe I have has to do with reality show ""writers"" claiming they are not as well paid as other TV writers.  Does not the word ""writer"" imply a script, which means that reality shows are FAKE?  And what do these hacks do that can be considered writing?  Do they make people laugh like the writers for The Simpsons or Seinfeld do?  Do they stimulate the intellect like the writers for Jeopardy?  Do they ignite the imagination in the way that the writers for shows like The X-Files and Star Trek do?  No to all the above.  All they do is create crap.Take that reality show writers - go home and walk it off!!!",1,You should be ashamed of yourself for wanting this.,1166659200,"12 21, 2006",2006,1460,"['who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Sturgeon', 'Law', 'least', 'ninety', 'percent', 'everything', 'crap', 'case', 'reality', 'shows', 'where', 'asymptote', 'bypassed', 'have', 'met', 'perfection', 'Here', '100', '%', 'everything', 'crap', 'Reality', 'programming', 'vacuum', 'quality', 'can', 'not', 'exist.Reality', 'shows', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'thing', 'television', 'HIV', 'immune', 'system', 'renders', 'diseased', 'depleted', 'ultimately', 'useless', 'Survivor', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'cultural', 'intellectual', 'parasites', 'blew', 'door', 'wide', 'open', 'quadrillions', 'other', 'shows', 'ilk', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'introduced', 'world', 'Johnny', 'Fairplay', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'not', 'cool', 'guy', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'who', 'gracious', 'fans', 'Mark', 'Burnette', 'be', 'tried', 'crimes', 'humanity.One', 'more', 'gripe', 'have', 'do', 'reality', 'show', 'writers', 'claiming', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'paid', 'other', 'TV', 'writers', 'not', 'word', 'writer', 'imply', 'script', 'reality', 'shows', 'are', 'FAKE', 'what', 'do', 'hacks', 'do', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'writing', 'Do', 'make', 'people', 'writers', 'Simpsons', 'Seinfeld', 'do', 'Do', 'stimulate', 'intellect', 'writers', 'Jeopardy', 'Do', 'ignite', 'imagination', 'way', 'writers', 'shows', 'X-Files', 'Star', 'Trek', 'do', 'above', 'do', 'create', 'crap.Take', 'reality', 'show', 'go', 'home', 'walk', 'off']",Survivor - The Complete First Season
818410,A45DMDHO56OK6,B0001ZDKXI,Colin,"[7, 7]","I've been fascinated by Survivor since it's debut in 2000. The simple premise, 16 Americans stuck on an island, fending for themselves and subsequently devouring each other until only one top dog is left, is just extremely watchable.This is the DVD box set of the complete first season. Even though I saw this when it aired on TV, it was still exciting even though I knew who won. It was just very neat to see everyone get picked off and alliances forming. If you've seen the latest seasons of Survivor, you may be shocked because of how low-key everything is. The editing and the repetitive music are kind of off-putting, especially in the first few episodes. But the castaways, the characters, are what makes this season especially fascinating. The rotund schemer, Richard Hatch, is the most interesting to watch as he develops from a whiny corporate leader to the master of island life.I only give the DVD 4 stars because of a lack of bonus features. Other than two audio commentaries, there's just a retrospective interview, a David Letterman top 10 list, and an unnarrated and uncohesive look at the Survivors leaving L.A. for Borneo. Also available in this set is the ""Greatest & Most Outrageous Moments"" DVD, which is previously available, and is simply a highlight reel of the first series. It is uncensored, though, so if you want to hear salty language or see Richard Hatch's butt in all its glory, well, there you go.",4,Surviving the island,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,1428,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'fascinated', 'Survivor', 'debut', '2000', 'simple', 'premise', '16', 'Americans', 'stuck', 'island', 'fending', 'subsequently', 'devouring', 'other', 'only', 'one', 'top', 'dog', 'left', 'just', 'extremely', 'watchable.This', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'complete', 'first', 'season', 'Even', 'saw', 'when', 'aired', 'TV', 'was', 'still', 'exciting', 'even', 'knew', 'who', 'won', 'was', 'just', 'very', 'neat', 'see', 'everyone', 'get', 'picked', 'off', 'alliances', 'forming', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'latest', 'seasons', 'Survivor', 'may', 'be', 'shocked', 'how', 'low-key', 'everything', 'editing', 'repetitive', 'music', 'are', 'kind', 'off-putting', 'especially', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'castaways', 'characters', 'are', 'what', 'season', 'especially', 'fascinating', 'rotund', 'schemer', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'most', 'interesting', 'watch', 'whiny', 'corporate', 'leader', 'master', 'island', 'life.I', 'only', 'give', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'lack', 'bonus', 'features', 'Other', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'just', 'retrospective', 'interview', 'David', 'Letterman', 'top', '10', 'list', 'unnarrated', 'uncohesive', 'look', 'Survivors', 'leaving', 'L.A.', 'Borneo', 'Also', 'available', 'set', 'Greatest', 'Most', 'Outrageous', 'Moments', 'DVD', 'previously', 'available', 'simply', 'highlight', 'reel', 'first', 'series', 'uncensored', 'though', 'so', 'want', 'hear', 'salty', 'language', 'see', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'butt', 'glory', 'well', 'go']",Survivor - The Complete First Season

818421,A2GBQRSI8FPAL,B0001ZDKXI,K. O. Gibson,"[7, 9]","I admit that I did not understand the 'Survivor' hype when it first hit and never saw an episode. My review is for those, like me, who would like to take in the series, post-hype, and see for themselves.It's hard to belive that this first aired in 2000 and the Mother of the reality-tv blitz that's available today. It certainly is one of the classier entries. It started off slow for me but once you hit the third episode, you're starting to anticipate the tribal councils and starting to figure out how the myriad 'alliances' between players will play out (or not).Watching the show four years later you start to see how the press coverage of notable contestants took hold. Rich: the not so duplicitous (to me, anyway) and frank corporate-guy-turned-castaway. Susan Hawk, the Fargo-voiced salt mama who don't take no crap, ay? [Her infamous dress-down of Kelly put's Al Pacino's 'You're out of order!' speech in 'And Justice For All' to shame]I thought she went way overboard, but just getting to that moment is worth watching for. Colleen, the cute island sprite who talks like your loopy but fun cousin from summers past. Rudy, the Midwestern drone who does most of his on-screen commentary up to his neck in the sea but is rarely spotted, uh, working. Kelly, the Everygirl who doubts the convenience of alliances and thinks for herself at a time when nerves are fraying and things are getting more personal.The four disc set and bonus DVD are a worthy purchase if you want entertainment, pseudo-travelogue and interest in how these people lived 39 days on an island to win a million dollars. Knowing who the winner is of this first series, as most do, will not detract from how that comes to be. I enjoyed the set and it definitely interested me in further editions. Credit is due to excellent production values and the stamina of the players. You'll feel good to pause the DVD and be able to get a sandwich and remember you have food to eat!

818424,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001ZDKXI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[33, 41]","No question, the most memorable moment of ""Survivor: Borneo"" was during the final tribal council when Sue Hawk unloaded on Kelly Wigglesworth.  When Sue told Kelly ""if I were ever to pass you in this life again, and you were laying there, dying of thirst, I would not give you a drink of water. I'd just let the vultures take you, and do whatever they want with you, with no ill regrets,"" everyone watching had their jaws on the ground.  When Sue finished her speech and made her plea for the contest to end the way Mother Nature intended it with Richard the Snake eating Kelly the Rat, I can remember thinking that they can do ""Survivor"" until the end of time and they will never top that moment.  Every time one of the jury members tells Jeff Probst that they want to make a statement rather than ask a question, they get judged against the Sue Hawk standard and they fail (It is like lighting the Olympic flame; no one will top using the archer at Barcelona).However, when I watched ""Survivor: The Complete First Season"" again on DVD what was confirmed for me was that the most pivotal moment in the show came in the tribal council at the end of Episode 7.  This was not only when the road was paved for Richard Hatch to be the sole Survivor, but also when the course of American popular culture changed.  This is because once Hatch won the million dollars, his strategy of alliance and deception became the template for how future competitors would attempt to outwit, outplay and outlast the others on ""Survivor"" but on ""Big Brother"" and virtually every other reality game show.  But what people forget is that at the turning point in the series MOST of the castaways were playing the game quite differently.Episode 7 was the first tribal vote after the merger and you probably remember that Gretchen, who was the most popular of the contestants and the one we thought personified the skills of a true Survivor.  But Gretchen was voted off because she had four of the ten votes cast.  The four who voted for her were (surprise, surprise), Richard, Kelly, Sue, and Rudy.  But do you recall the rest of the votes?  Greg voted against Jenna, Jenna voted against Gervase, Gervase voted against Susan, Sean voted against Colleen, Colleen voted against Richard, and Gretchen voted against Rudy (remember, nobody ever voted against Kelly).  In other words, the other six all voted for six different people.  But not only did the former members of Pagong all vote for different people, instead of targeting a member of Tagi, but Greg and Jenna both voted against Pagong teamamates.  All together now: What were they thinking?Well, in retrospect, I think it is clear that what the former members of Pagong were thinking when they mereged with Tagi into Rattana, was that they really were now one tribe.  Needless to say, this is not a mistake that has been made since that day.  Consequently most ""Survivors"" since then have featured a reshuffling of the tribes before the merger, just to keep things interesting.  Unfortunately the commentary for these episodes on DVD is quite limited (but insightful for the first and last episodes), because I would have liked to have checked my hypothesis, which is that it was Gretchen herself, by word or deed, who propagated the idea that doomed first her and then the rest of the former Pagong players one by one by one.My thesis is that this was an event of great cultural significance.  If Pagong had decided to target any one of the Tagi players, whether it was Rich or not, that would have been five votes to four and the steamroller would have been on their side.  I do not think they would have voted for Rich, because he was providing food, and since Gretchen voted for Rudy that would be consistent with the Pagong approach of getting rid of the member of the tribe who was contributing the least.  Play that token out to the end and Gretchen wins.  Given who would have won (most qualified) and how they won (voting off the weakest and not the strongest member), the course of popular culture and American civilization would have been changed and, more importantly, changed for the better.  Face it.  This country was not built on the idea of taking out the strongest or the best.  That is the goal, not the objective.  Make Richard Hatch the role model and we are heading for a bizarre dystopia no one ever would have expected.The other thing that rewatching the original ""Survivor"" confirms is that Mark Burnett did a marvelous job of creating suspense when there was not any.  After Episode 7, which was furiously debated around the nation's ""watercoolers,"" the consensus was that unless the rest of the castaways wised up, the alliance of four was going to run the table.  Which they did.  But Burnett, aided by some the release of some computer alterred photographs, cut these episodes so that there was always a slim reed of hope that the alliance would be derailed.  But it never happened.  Who went home when the tribe spoke each week might have been a surprise, but it was never one of the alliance until they were the only ones left and started eating their own.I almost always like to watch movies twice because I like to see how the end game is set up, and that same approach is what makes watching ""Survivor: The Complete First Season"" interesting.  Knowing the outcome informs your enjoyment and understanding, not only of how the game was being played that first time around, but also how it was editing for maximum effect.  One suggestion when you watch these episodes again: After each one go check out the CBS web site for ""Survivor: Borneo"" because they are all still up, and you can still access all of the information and extras, such as polls and stuff.  Frozen there for Internet eternity right now are the online poll predictions for the finale.  Rudy was the overwhelming favorite with 53.47%, with Kelly second at 22.54% and Susan third at 12.22%.  Richard Hatch was sitting at 11.75% and he ends up being the one with the million dollar check.  Now we know how he did it and what it has meant.",5,"""Survivor: Boreneo"" and the beginning of the end of America",1098921600,"10 28, 2004",2004,6066,"['question', 'most', 'memorable', 'moment',

Watching the first season of Survivor, you can really see how the simpler, cleaner and more laid-back filming style worked wonders, turning a longshot reality show into the hottest series of the year.Later editions, like Australian Outback and Survivor: Africa, tried to tinker with the format, adding more music and other bells and whistles...and eventually Survivor became what it is today (slick and processed). It lost the ""edge"" Survivor: Borneo displays, the unique feeling that you were staring reality in the face, and anything could happen at any given moment.Also, back then the show focused on little things that meant nothing: people playing ukeleles, sitting around, swinging in hammocks. Today it seems as if every Survivor contestant's day is scheduled down to the minute. Episodes are edited to create fake crises and promote certain characters/storylines. Alliances are purposely covered up by the producers to keep viewers in the dark.

818428,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B0001ZDKXI,Mark Baker,"[4, 5]","I remember back in summer of 2000 (was it really that long ago?) reading about a little show that CBS was putting on their summer schedule.  Since I've often thought about life abandoned on an island, I thought it would be interesting to tune in and watch.  Little did I know what I was about to get hooked on.This show was not so much about surviving the elements, and I almost tuned out.  But I soon got caught in the political battle of surviving each other.  Thanks to the fabulous editing, I tuned in each week to see who would be voted out next.  And, as the season drew to an end, I hoped each week that the alliance would crack.  And each week, I was disappointed.  Still, Wednesday night, I never missed a show.In many ways, this season defined this show.  It has become all about alliances and whom you trust.  If it hadn't been for Richard Hatch, who knows how this game would have been played in later editions.  Speaking of Rich, he was the man we all loved to hate; yet he deserved to win since he was brilliant at playing the game.  Of course, at the time, I was rooting for Kelly all the way.  And you will never be able to top Sue's snake and hawk speech in the final tribal counsel.This season of this show has done more to change the American TV landscape then any other I know.  Not necessarily for the better (""Who wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire"" or ""Temptation Island"" anyone?)  Still, it entertains and sucks you in.  While many seasons have come close, no season will ever top this season of the show because it was all-new then.",5,The One That Started It All,1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,1557,"['remember', 'back', 'summer', '2000', 'was', 'really', 'long', 'ago', 'reading', 'little', 'show', 'CBS', 'was', 'putting', 'summer', 'schedule', ""'ve"", 'often', 'thought', 'life', 'abandoned', 'island', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'tune', 'watch', 'Little', 'did', 'know', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'get', 'hooked', 'on.This', 'show', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'surviving', 'elements', 'almost', 'tuned', 'out', 'soon', 'got', 'caught', 'political', 'battle', 'surviving', 'other', 'Thanks', 'fabulous', 'editing', 'tuned', 'week', 'see', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'voted', 'out', 'next', 'season', 'drew', 'end', 'hoped', 'week', 'alliance', 'would', 'crack', 'week', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Still', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'never', 'missed', 'show.In', 'many', 'ways', 'season', 'defined', 'show', 'become', 'alliances', 'whom', 'trust', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'Richard', 'Hatch', 'who', 'how', 'game', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'later', 'editions', 'Speaking', 'Rich', 'was', 'man', 'loved', 'hate', 'deserved', 'win', 'was', 'brilliant', 'playing', 'game', 'course', 'time', 'was', 'rooting', 'Kelly', 'way', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'top', 'Sue', 'snake', 'hawk', 'speech', 'final', 'tribal', 'counsel.This', 'season', 'show', 'done', 'more', 'change', 'American', 'TV', 'landscape', 'then', 'other', 'know', 'Not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'Who', 'Marry', 'Multi-Millionaire', 'Temptation', 'Island', 'anyone', 'Still', 'many', 'seasons', 'have', 'come', 'close', 'season', 'will', 'ever', 'top', 'season', 'show', 'was', 'all-new', 'then']",Survivor - The Complete First Season

I was so glad they came out with this in time for the break for the summer. It's really interesting to look back on the beginnings of Survivor and compare that to say Survivor All Stars. These people who you see on the first season, had no idea what they were in for, and that's why it seems more genuine, and more interesting then the other seasons. There were points in it that you could see crew members interacting with the cast, and Jeff Probst. The music is definitely more American from the first season. One immunity challenge in Season one has Piano and Techno music a la C.S.I. The main difference is that these people had fun. You see them enjoying themselves much more then you do now. They weren't making alliances from the very second they stepped on the beach. I love the current Survivor, but this DVD set really is awesome to watch. Highly recommended to any Survivor fan!

While most of the other castaways don't even consider forming a group of people that will all vote a certain way, Hatch gathers a couple misfits to go along with his strategy. I suppose this is revolutionary and is why you should watch this season. I'm not really buying that because any person with half a brain would figure that out. When 4 people vote 1 way, people are shocked and don't really know what's going on. There is also an appearance of an idiot doctor named Sean who doesn't have enough courage to vote a certain way, so he adopted a strategy where he votes people out alphabetically. Hatch's crew knows this strategy and it really comes in handy on a certain vote. The music is terrible in this season and is so different from new survivors. This season is so much worse than season 2 Australia because season 1 is just so outdated and it seems like its 20 years ago. You have to buy this season if you are a fan of Survivor.

Not sure why I had never taken the time to see Season 1, but better late than never.""Survivor - The Complete First Season"" (5 DVDs) brought quite a few surprises to me. Let's start with the obvious ones: the first season (aired in May-August, 2000) focuses much more on the actual survivor aspect of the game (trying the find food, dealing with the weather elements, etc.) and also the mind-blowing lack of strategy on the part of most players (but not Rich, the eventual winner). I must say I was a bit frustrated by that lack of strategy, given the later development of the game (I mean, Sean voting at TC on alphabetical reasons, which had a huge impact at one point). Jeff Probst is amazingly different from later seasons, more an observor rather than the interpellant we know him now. And the Tribal Counsils were so short! Really just to let them vote.Other surprises, randomly: Rich, the self-proclamined gay guy, actually has a son! Kelly winning the last 5 ICs in the game, wow (not sure it's ever been done again). Rudy was a surprisingly weak player. Then Kelly choosing to take Rich to the Final 2, rather than Rudy, surely costing her the victory. Then there is Colleen, ""America's Sweetheart"" as Brian Gumble called her in the (excellent) Reunion show, who was 23 then but looked more like 16. She is 36 or 37 now! I wonder whatever happened to her. And then there is of course Sue's now infamous rant at the final TC against Kelly. Wow.There is a bonus DVD (135 min.) of out-takes and various assorted unseen footage (such as the audition tapes) that is mildly entertaining. The real joy is seeing the humble beginnings of Survivor in its first season (not until the final TC did Jeff Probst utter the now classic words ""the Xth person voted off is""). Really enjoyed this, and I plan on re-seeing Season 2, which I haven't seen since it aired in Spring, 2001.",4,Survivor's humble beginnings...,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",2013,1969,"['became', 'huge', 'Survivor', 'fan', 'starting', 'Season', '2', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'Season', '1', 'now', 'Not', 'sure', 'why', 'had', 'never', 'taken', 'time', 'see', 'Season', '1', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'Survivor', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', '5', 'DVDs', 'brought', 'quite', 'few', 'surprises', 'Let', 'start', 'obvious', 'ones', 'first', 'season', 'aired', 'May-August', '2000', 'much', 'more', 'actual', 'survivor', 'aspect', 'game', 'trying', 'find', 'food', 'dealing', 'weather', 'elements', 'etc', 'also', 'mind-blowing', 'lack', 'strategy', 'part', 'most', 'players', 'not', 'Rich', 'eventual', 'winner', 'must', 'say', 'was', 'bit', 'frustrated', 'lack', 'strategy', 'given', 'later', 'development', 'game', 'mean', 'Sean', 'voting', 'TC', 'alphabetical', 'reasons', 'had', 'huge', 'impact', 'one', 'point', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'amazingly', 'different', 'later', 'seasons', 'more', 'observor', 'rather', 'interpellant', 'know', 'now', 'Tribal', 'Counsils', 'were', 'so', 'short', 'Really', 'just', 'let', 'vote.Other', 'surprises', 'randomly', 'Rich', 'self-proclamined', 'gay', 'guy', 'actually', 'son', 'Kelly', 'winning', 'last', '5', 'ICs', 'game', 'wow', 'not', 'sure', 'ever', 'been', 'done', 'again', 'Rudy', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'weak', 'player', 'Then', 'Kelly', 'choosing', 'take', 'Rich', 'Final', '2', 'rather', 'Rudy', 'surely', 'costing', 'victory', 'Then', 'Colleen', 'America', 'Sweetheart', 'Brian', 'Gumble', 'called', 'excellent', 'Reunion', 'show', 'who', 'was', '23', 'then', 'looked', 'more', '16', '36', '37', 'now', 'wonder', 'happened', 'then', 'course', 'Sue', 'now', 'infamous', 'rant', 'final', 'TC', 'Kelly', 'Wow.There', 'bonus', 'DVD', '135', 'min', 'out-takes', 'various', 'assorted', 'unseen', 'footage', 'such', 'audition', 'tapes', 'mildly', 'entertaining', 'real', 'joy', 'seeing', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'Survivor', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'final', 'TC', 'did', 'Jeff', 'Probst', 'now', 'classic', 'words', 'Xth', 'person', 'voted', 'off', 'Really', 'enjoyed', 'plan', 're-seeing', 'Season', '2', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'aired', 'Spring', '2001']",Survivor - The Complete First Season

Anderson ""sma331""","[7, 10]","Edited comments(After watching the DVD series):Despite knowing Richard Hatch won Survivor Boreno I really enjoyed watching this DVD series. You could see how the show has changed as the Survivor series evolved. With this being the first show you could see that people had no idea how to go about playing the game. Some people seem to treat it like a summer vacation, not realizing it's a competition!! Richard Hatch was cocky from day one, and he had the check claimed. Being that I rented this series I had no idea who was eliminated until I watched the series itself. I could have gone on the website and found out, but that would have taken the fun away from watching the DVD series. During the Tribal council they would hit the gong as they crossed the bridge. One thing that did keep Richard in the game was his fish catching skills. The Pagong tribe had to eat Rat for their protein. Uggggghhhhhh I knew that BB would be voted out in no time. He had a strong work ethic, but he was very, very bossy. Knew that would not go over too well. Greg and his nature phone, that man was crazy!!!! Richard did not get naked until the Udder Revenge episode, so happy it was still blurred out!!!!Am I the only one who thought it was mean of Jeff to play all the tapes then to tell Jenna her tape did not arrive? I know that was for ratings, but it was so mean. During the reward on the yaht a winner had a special surprise, and that made the evening doubly special. Colleen needed to keep her shut, she voted herself off with her comment. Dumb move!!!As the game progressed people realized if they were to make it to the next round, they had no choice but to join alliances. That's when the backstabbing and double crossing really begins.

Each week they compete against each other in contests for reward and immunity.  The tribe losing the immunity challenge has to go to tribal council and vote one member out until there are two members left.  Then a council of 9 former castaways votes for the winner of a one million dollar prize.Season one had probably the shows most memorable cast including tough, truck driving Sue Hawk, former Navy seal and senior citizen Rudy Boesch, cute Colleen Haskell, and of course, season one winner Richard Hatch.Each week was a fascinating look at these people scheming and planning to save themselves and get rid of someone else.  Richard made himself invaluable to the tribe due to his ability to catch fish and feed the tribe.This skill kept him in the tribe even through his arrogance and refusal to help out in any other of the tribe work.  Strangely the openly gay Hatch who loved to walk around nude (a brilliant tactic by the way) bonded with the tough, old, and very anti-gay Rudy.You'll recall some faces that you may have forgotten such as Sonia who was the first person EVER voted out of Survivor, Dirk, the ultra religious man who annoyed everyone, Greg & Colleen who were Survivors first romance, And Gervase, who annoyed most of the women with chauvanist comments about them being like cows.The final episode was notable for Sue telling Kelly she would not give her water if she were dying of thirst.  Greg cast the deciding vote giving Richard the victory.The DVD set also includes the reunion show as well as a number of other special features.Survivor is still the king of Reality TV!

It is when and ONLY when the subject does NOT know they are being filmed. Security cameras, hidden cameras, that sort of thing. But to call programs like this ""reality"" is to bastardize the language. Understand that what you're seeing is a PRODUCT of editing and musical score. A very telling photograph I saw featured the Survivor people with a phalanx of production crew in front of them - cameramen, boom mike ops, lighting crew. Now YOU tell me, YOU are just going to ""be yourself"" with all THAT going on around you? Hardly. No one who has a camera put in front of their face is truly themselves. A little bit of guard goes up, filtering true spontanaeity. And you have to think that producers of this garbage plan the arcs they'd like to see, certain ""plot"" elements fleshed out, all in the name of making ""good tv"". I feel certain that one day one of these ""reality"" participants will pen a tell-all down the road detailing just how phony this genre truly is. You KNOW the nets aren't looking forward to the day when - hopefully - this garbage ends, after all it is CHEAP to produce. Another tragic side to this garbage is how it has hijacked coverage on local news telecasts.

818445,AP3B615GM191G,B0001ZDKXI,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","This first season of Survivor was not the very first foray into reality television (MTV had already experiment with filming people on ""Real World"").  However, this indeed was the first time that the concept was applied to a mass audience and packaged in a way that made it seem exciting and dramatic.Basically, Survivor sees a group of 16 people stranded on an island in Borneo.  With only a few basic survival items and their wits, the contestants are separated into two tribes and must compete with each other until a sole winner is crowned with the prize of one million dollars.  Each week, a different contestant would be voted off the island by their fellow mates.Besides the challenges for rewards and immunity, the show really became intriguing because of its mix of characters and situations.  For example...-The oft-nude homosexual Richard forging an unlikely bond with the grumpy, 70-something former Navy Seal Rudy.-The ""serious tribe"" (Tagi) versus the ""fun"" tribe (Pagong).-The alliances that would constantly shift or become re-defined with seemingly every episode.-The humor infused into the show that comes from that many people living together and tolerating each other.Basically, though conceptually a ""gameshow"" in name as a prize is competed for, it quickly became clear that the entire experience was really more of a social experiment than anything.  Viewers could easily identify with (or vilify) a certain character, thus making it feel as if living vicariously through them on the island.Overall, ""Survivor"" was a completely new idea that (for a time) revolutionized the way TV dramas could be made.  Though now reality shows so dominate the market that the ideas are running on empty, this set is an ode to a time when the concept was fresh, real, and exciting all at once.
