884009,A2SF13TQH422SB,B0007NMHOC,B. M. Kunz,"[22, 24]","In the film Bad Boy Bubby, the title character is a thirty-five year old man child who has been locked inside a cramped, dingy room by his abusive mother for his entire life. When Bubby's Pop suddenly shows up after a thirty-five year absence, Bubby is flushed out of his home, and the only world he has ever known, by his Mom and Pop, and into the ""real"" world, where he experiences equal measures of human cruelty and human kindness.The film is at times bleak, harrowing, funny, heartbreaking and ultimately hopeful. All of the actors do a very fine job, but Nicholas Hope's performance as Bubby is absolutely stunning. There's a long tradition of actors delving into roles of this type, Sling Blade, Awakenings or Rain Man for example, and while Hope's performance isn't as widely regarded as the lead performances in these three films, it surely would be if the film Bad Boy Bubby had received a wider release - especially in the United States, where until now it has been practically nonexistent.  Now however, thanks to Blue Underground and this great DVD release a much wider audience will hopefully be able to see this exceptional film for the first time.Once again Blue Underground has done a really topnotch job. The film transfer looks great and there are two sound options: a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround and a Dolby Surround 2.0. Of special note, the sound for the film was recorded using a binaural sound system that is meant to allow the viewer the experience of hearing everything the same way the main character would.  The extras on the disc are a 24 minute interview with director Rolf de Heer, who describes the interesting binaural recording process and reveals a lot of fascinating insights and details, including the fact that over 30 different cinematographers were used to shoot the film.  There is a second 15 minute interview with Nicholas Hope who discusses his career before, during, and after Bad Boy Bubby.  The short film that led to Nicholas Hope being cast in the role of Bubby, titled Confessor Caressor,  is also included. And finally, there is also a theatrical trailer for Bad Boy Bubby and a poster/stills gallery. In all a great disc befitting a remarkable film.",4,Remarkable,1113436800,"04 14, 2005",2005,2200,"['film', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'title', 'character', 'thirty-five', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'child', 'who', 'been', 'locked', 'cramped', 'dingy', 'room', 'abusive', 'mother', 'entire', 'life', 'When', 'Bubby', 'Pop', 'suddenly', 'up', 'thirty-five', 'year', 'absence', 'Bubby', 'flushed', 'home', 'only', 'world', 'ever', 'known', 'Mom', 'Pop', 'real', 'world', 'where', 'equal', 'measures', 'human', 'cruelty', 'human', 'kindness.The', 'film', 'times', 'bleak', 'harrowing', 'funny', 'heartbreaking', 'ultimately', 'hopeful', 'actors', 'do', 'very', 'fine', 'job', 'Nicholas', 'Hope', 'performance', 'Bubby', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'long', 'tradition', 'actors', 'delving', 'roles', 'type', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'Awakenings', 'Rain', 'Man', 'example', 'Hope', 'performance', ""n't"", 'as', 'widely', 'regarded', 'lead', 'performances', 'three', 'films', 'surely', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'had', 'received', 'wider', 'release', 'especially', 'United', 'States', 'where', 'now', 'been', 'practically', 'nonexistent', 'Now', 'however', 'thanks', 'Blue', 'Underground', 'great', 'DVD', 'release', 'much', 'wider', 'audience', 'will', 'hopefully', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'exceptional', 'film', 'first', 'time.Once', 'again', 'Blue', 'Underground', 'done', 'really', 'topnotch', 'job', 'film', 'transfer', 'great', 'are', 'two', 'sound', 'options', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Surround', 'Dolby', 'Surround', '2.0', 'special', 'note', 'sound', 'film', 'was', 'recorded', 'using', 'binaural', 'sound', 'system', 'meant', 'allow', 'viewer', 'experience', 'hearing', 'everything', 'same', 'way', 'main', 'character', 'would', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', '24', 'minute', 'interview', 'director', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'who', 'interesting', 'binaural', 'recording', 'process', 'lot', 'fascinating', 'insights', 'details', 'including', 'fact', '30', 'different', 'cinematographers', 'were', 'used', 'shoot', 'film', 'second', '15', 'minute', 'interview', 'Nicholas', 'Hope', 'who', 'career', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'short', 'film', 'led', 'Nicholas', 'Hope', 'being', 'cast', 'role', 'Bubby', 'titled', 'Confessor', 'Caressor', 'also', 'included', 'finally', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'poster/stills', 'gallery', 'great', 'disc', 'befitting', 'remarkable', 'film']",N/A
884010,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B0007NMHOC,buru buru piggu,"[5, 8]","I recently discovered this Australian film while looking through IMDB and was intrigued by the premise of a grown man kept housebound by his mother for the entire 35 years of his life. Considered quite disturbing and controversial at the time (1993) for its portrayal of animal abuse, incest, and blasphemy, it pushes the bounds of good taste and decency even now 17 years later, with an steady and unrelenting stream of bizarre encounters, visual obscenities, and vulgar utterances. It is a long movie, clocking in at almost 2 hours, and can be slow at times. After watching it, I'm not quite sure what to make of my experience except to say I feel disoriented and exhausted. Billed as a black comedy/drama and shot by 31 different cinematographers, director Rolf de Heer describes it as one big experiment. All I can say is, to misquote a line from the film, Christ, this is a weird movie.I can best describe ""Bad Boy Bubby"" as what would happen if Forrest Gump were directed by Marilyn Manson (or the other Manson). As described above, Bubby (think Billy Bob Thornton of Sling Blade mated with Hugo Weaving) is a developmentally challenged male who has been kept inside a small rundown tenement by his mother his entire life. Verbally and physically abused, she puts the fear of corporal punishment and God in him so he stays quite and docile. At night, she has sexual relations with him. Told that the outside world is filled with poison gas, she dons a gas mask before leaving and tells him to be still until she returns lest she beats him brainless. We see him mimic the actions and verbal abuse of his mother on a stray cat he finds. He later clingwraps and unknowingly suffocates the animal because his mom told him cats don't breathe as an excuse for why the cat came from outside and didn't die from the supposed poisonous air. Unexpectedly, his father returns after 35 years and proceeds to have sexual relations with Bubby's mom. Already having developed a fascination with large breasts, it is reinforced by the Pop's lecherous behavior and fondness for his wife's ""great big whoppers"".After Pop walks in on Bubby fondling his mom's breasts, Pop goes into a rage and kicks Bubby out. From here, he is forced into the real world and embarks on one twisted encounter after another. Some of it is painful to watch because they do tend to be slow and aimless, like Bubby's life. If this is a comedy, I didn't laugh at his misfortunes at interacting with the world, not out of any sense of 21st Century political sensitivity, but mainly because they weren't funny. I did laugh at one scene of Bubby when he gets put in jail and sodomized by ""the Animal"". This is maybe the only movie you'll see sodomy set to the music of bagpipes. Bobby takes it in stride, so to speak, as he accepts the abuse that is such a routine in his life. An expression of serenity crosses his face. The rest of the story has Bubby having more weird experiences, but eventually, he finds his place in the world. He discovers his humanity, and even discovers love. I found the story arc a bit unbelievable, especially towards the end, but I won't spoil the surprise.All in all, I can't say that this was a thoroughly pleasurable experience. It really felt like an exercise in avant-garde filmmaking or an assignment from a film class. There are several scenes of nudity, copious amounts of cussing, and unapologetic blasphemy. I can't say that I gained any insight into cinema, the human condition, or other intellectual merits of this film, and for that I'm giving it a 3/5. Definitely rent it first.Comment",3,An experiment in oddity,1258848000,"11 22, 2009",2009,3590,"['recently', 'discovered', 'Australian', 'film', 'looking', 'IMDB', 'was', 'intrigued', 'premise', 'grown', 'man', 'kept', 'housebound', 'mother', 'entire', '35', 'years', 'life', 'Considered', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'controversial', 'time', '1993', 'portrayal', 'animal', 'abuse', 'incest', 'blasphemy', 'bounds', 'good', 'taste', 'decency', 'even', 'now', '17', 'years', 'later', 'steady', 'unrelenting', 'stream', 'bizarre', 'encounters', 'visual', 'obscenities', 'vulgar', 'utterances', 'long', 'movie', 'clocking', 'almost', '2', 'hours', 'can', 'be', 'slow', 'times', 'watching', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'experience', 'say', 'feel', 'disoriented', 'exhausted', 'Billed', 'black', 'comedy/drama', 'shot', '31', 'different', 'cinematographers', 'director', 'Rolf', 'de', 'Heer', 'one', 'big', 'experiment', 'can', 'say', 'misquote', 'line', 'film', 'Christ', 'weird', 'movie.I', 'can', 'best', 'describe', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'were', 'directed', 'Marilyn', 'Manson', 'other', 'Manson', 'described', 'Bubby', 'think', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thornton', 'Sling', 'Blade', 'mated', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'developmentally', 'challenged', 'male', 'who', 'been', 'kept', 'small', 'rundown', 'tenement', 'mother', 'entire', 'life', 'Verbally', 'physically', 'abused', 'fear', 'corporal', 'punishment', 'God', 'so', 'quite', 'docile', 'night', 'sexual', 'relations', 'Told', 'outside', 'world', 'filled', 'poison', 'gas', 'gas', 'mask', 'leaving', 'be', 'still', 'lest', 'brainless', 'see', 'mimic', 'actions', 'verbal', 'abuse', 'mother', 'stray', 'cat', 'later', 'clingwraps', 'unknowingly', 'animal', 'mom', 'told', 'cats', 'do', ""n't"", 'breathe', 'excuse', 'why', 'cat', 'came', 'outside', 'did', ""n't"", 'die', 'supposed', 'poisonous', 'air', 'Unexpectedly', 'father', 'returns', '35', 'years', 'proceeds', 'have', 'sexual', 'relations', 'Bubby', 'mom', 'Already', 'having', 'developed', 'fascination', 'large', 'breasts', 'reinforced', 'Pop', 'lecherous', 'behavior', 'fondness', 'wife', 'great', 'big', 'whoppers', '.After', 'Pop', 'walks', 'Bubby', 'fondling', 'mom', 'breasts', 'Pop', 'rage', 'kicks', 'Bubby', 'out', 'here', 'forced', 'real', 'world', 'embarks', 'one', 'twisted', 'encounter', 'painful', 'watch', 'do', 'tend', 'be', 'slow', 'aimless', 'Bubby', 'life', 'comedy', 'did', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'misfortunes', 'interacting', 'world', 'not', 'sense', '21st', 'Century', 'political', 'sensitivity', 'mainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'funny', 'did', 'laugh', 'one', 'scene', 'Bubby', 'when', 'put', 'jail', 'sodomized', 'Animal', 'maybe', 'only', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'see', 'sodomy', 'set', 'music', 'bagpipes', 'Bobby', 'stride', 'so', 'speak', 'abuse', 'routine', 'life', 'expression', 'serenity', 'face', 'rest', 'story', 'Bubby', 'having', 'more', 'weird', 'experiences', 'eventually', 'place', 'world', 'humanity', 'even', 'discovers', 'love', 'found', 'story', 'bit', 'unbelievable', 'especially', 'end', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'surprise.All', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'pleasurable', 'experience', 'really', 'felt', 'exercise', 'avant-garde', 'filmmaking', 'assignment', 'film', 'class', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'nudity', 'copious', 'amounts', 'cussing', 'unapologetic', 'blasphemy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'gained', 'insight', 'cinema', 'human', 'condition', 'other', 'intellectual', 'merits', 'film', ""'m"", 'giving', '3/5', 'Definitely', 'rent', 'first.Comment']",N/A

But now, there's another one to add to that list. And that would be: ""Bad Boy Bubby"" by Rolf de Heer! As far as I know, the film was never shown here in the states (or had a very small, or limited release). But it did very well in Europe, and in other parts of the world. It's hard to define a film like ""Bad Boy Bubby"", but it is truly an unique experience! If you can imagine what humankind was like before it lost the ""I"" (which was replaced by the group-soul/group-ego), 'Bubby' is something like that. He seems to have retained that purity and other-wordliness. The actor who played 'Bubby' (Nicholas Hope) was absolutely brilliant. He literally transformed himself into 'Bubby' and made his world accessible and believable, his ability was uncanny. The rest of the players were all very good too, and supported 'bubby' on his journey of discovery. I can't praise this film enough, that's how good it is! Some reviewers have compared it to ""Being There"" (which is a great film in its own right). I think ""Billy Budd"" and Werner Herzog's ""The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser"" are also worthy comparisons. But there really is nothing quite like this film! You will laugh, you will cry, and you will laugh again. There may be hope for humankind after all!

The central performance from Nicholas Hope is simply fantastic despite all the unconventional aspects of a character that has not been let out of his room for over three decades.

He said he had been on lay over from a plane trip in Brussels.  Since he was a film curator, he tries to see rare films from the world.  He ended up seeing Bad Boy Bubby.  His search for the film to be shown in the US involved having to use the internet and people he knew in the Australian Film Industry to track down a print of the film.  He ended up having to contact the director directly to obtain a 35 mm print of the film.  I was really bowled over by it and have seen the film twice on the silver screen.  I was thrilled to see that it was so easily available on DVD.The story portrayed is about a man who has been locked away in an apartment by his mother his whole life.  Bubby's language and intellectual development has been stunted by the abuse suffered over the years.  Life changes a bit when his long lost father returns and Bubby ends up in the world, unable to do anything but mimic what others say and sounds.  Bubby emerges from an abusive household to a hostile world which slowly warms up to him and becomes more compassionate.  As Bubby is exposed to more compassion and kindness, he mimics the compassion and kindness others have shown him.  A good allegory on how people are affected by the way they are treated.

This movie is not gorey but it does contain disturbing scenes, a significant amount of nudity (male and female) and fake animal abuse. this movie is very well made and will have you feeling strongly for the main character and feeling his pain through the movie. this movie's plot is hard to see coming and by then end you are rooting for bubby.SOME SPOILERS; IF YOU NEED MORE INFO:It starts out showing Bubby getting sexually and physically abused by his mother. Bubby is a 35 year old shut in that has been kept from the rest of the world and only knows his mother and his cat. Bubby has the emotional maturity of a 5 year old and does not fully know how to intereact with people. The begining of this movie is hard to watch because of the abuse Bubby recieves.Bubby escapes from his mother and is introduced to the real world. he discovers music and pizza for the first time and it is very interesting to watch him interact with other people. We follow Bubby as he makes friends and falls in love, the ending is a pretty good shocker and it will leave you with a big WTF by then end.NOT A SPOILER:Get this movie and watch it. the main actor does an amazing job and if you enjoyed the movie you need to watch the extras too. this movie will have you thinking and creep you out pretty well.",5,Probably the greatest movie ever made,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,1688,"['will', 'start', 'off', 'warning', 'watch', 'messed', 'up', 'movies', 'one', 'really', 'messed', 'up', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'movie', 'going', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'watching', 'DO', 'NOT', 'WATCH', 'THIS', 'MOVIENON', 'SPOILER', 'SUMMARY', 'Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'man', 'been', 'sheltered', 'society', 'whole', 'life', 'finally', '35', 'discover', 'world', 'first', 'time', '90', 'movie', 'not', 'gorey', 'contain', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'significant', 'amount', 'nudity', 'male', 'female', 'fake', 'animal', 'abuse', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'will', 'have', 'feeling', 'strongly', 'main', 'character', 'feeling', 'pain', 'movie', 'movie', 'plot', 'hard', 'see', 'coming', 'then', 'end', 'are', 'rooting', 'bubby.SOME', 'SPOILERS', 'IF', 'YOU', 'NEED', 'MORE', 'INFO', 'out', 'showing', 'Bubby', 'getting', 'sexually', 'physically', 'abused', 'mother', 'Bubby', '35', 'year', 'old', 'shut', 'been', 'kept', 'rest', 'world', 'only', 'mother', 'cat', 'Bubby', 'emotional', 'maturity', '5', 'year', 'old', 'not', 'fully', 'know', 'how', 'intereact', 'people', 'begining', 'movie', 'hard', 'watch', 'abuse', 'Bubby', 'recieves.Bubby', 'escapes', 'mother', 'introduced', 'real', 'world', 'music', 'pizza', 'first', 'time', 'very', 'interesting', 'watch', 'interact', 'other', 'people', 'follow', 'Bubby', 'friends', 'falls', 'love', 'ending', 'pretty', 'good', 'shocker', 'will', 'leave', 'big', 'WTF', 'then', 'end.NOT', 'A', 'SPOILER', 'Get', 'movie', 'watch', 'main', 'actor', 'amazing', 'job', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'need', 'watch', 'extras', 'too', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'thinking', 'creep', 'out', 'pretty', 'well']",N/A
884016,ADQQE8RSV6KFP,B0007NMHOC,"Mondo Vendo ""Mondo Vendo""","[4, 7]","Bad Boy Bubby is one bad MF.  Well, he's not so bad (at least not on purpose) but he is a literal MF.  He's 35 years old and his depraved mother has kept him in a celler all his life.  She told him the outside world is poisonous and wears a gas mask whenever she goes out to scare Bubby into never daring to exit his tiny world.  She is very abusive to Bubby smacking him around.  The only time she says anything kind to Bubby is when she is having sex with him.Well, as I'm sure you know through some severe events, Bubby does finally discover his mother was lying and finally does venture out on his own into the outside world.There is much to comment on but just about everything could be seen as being a spoiler of some level.This is a movie that is known as one that if people like it, they really like.  As in the extras, Rolf De Heer explains that no one says they liked it without saying it was exceptional.Well, I am one who says it is good, OK but not exceptional.First off, as is done out of necessity, Bubby has an extremely easy and unnatural way of getting involved with all kinds of people and situations.  This is a guy who knows very few words, mostly repeating what others say, and looks like a homeless person (which I guess he is) with his wild unkept long and balding hair.Yet, Bubby gets one night stands, people drive him around, and he joins a rock band which he causes to grow extremely fast in popularity.Only the last relationship Bubby has (which I won't describe due to it being a major spoiler) progresses in manner central to the story and doesn't just happen because the story needs him to interact with a lot of random people.One of the most unrealistic interactions Bubby has is when he sees a group of women singing.  Bubby walks up into their faces and imitates them.  Then he starts feeling their breasts as he did mother.  All just gently stop him and the last one smiles.  The next scene has them getting it on with a beautiful young babe.  Yeah right.  We all wish the world worked this way but sadly it does not.Another problem with the movie is the cliched evil religious zealots who are Bubby's constant and only villians.  Bubby's mother warned him that Jesus was watching when she left.  And religious parents viciously humiliates another character by telling her that ""God hates fat people"".The positives of the movie are the rewarding ending which again I won't describe due to not wanting to reveal spoilers and the unique and entertaining style to the movie.It is really quite remarkable that a film like this could be made.  It is amazing that they could assemble a cast willing to do all the different unattractive roles, such as Bubby's fat incestrous unattractive mother, mentally handicapped, Bubby himself etc.It's definitely worth watching and the style is entertaining and unique.  However, be prepared to ""suspend your disbelief"" liberally as Bubby interacts with the world.",3,Bad Boy Bubby: MF On The Loose.,1117238400,"05 28, 2005",2005,2932,"['Bad', 'Boy', 'Bubby', 'one', 'bad', 'MF', 'Well', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'least', 'not', 'purpose', 'literal', 'MF', '35', 'years', 'old', 'depraved', 'mother', 'kept', 'celler', 'life', 'told', 'outside', 'world', 'poisonous', 'gas', 'mask', 'whenever', 'out', 'scare', 'Bubby', 'never', 'daring', 'exit', 'tiny', 'world', 'very', 'abusive', 'Bubby', 'smacking', 'around', 'only', 'time', 'anything', 'kind', 'Bubby', 'when', 'having', 'sex', 'him.Well', ""'m"", 'sure', 'know', 'severe', 'events', 'Bubby', 'finally', 'discover', 'mother', 'was', 'lying', 'finally', 'venture', 'out', 'own', 'outside', 'world.There', 'much', 'comment', 'just', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'being', 'spoiler', 'level.This', 'movie', 'known', 'one', 'people', 'really', 'like', 'extras', 'Rolf', 'De', 'Heer', 'one', 'liked', 'saying', 'was', 'exceptional.Well', 'am', 'one', 'who', 'good', 'OK', 'not', 'exceptional.First', 'off', 'done', 'necessity', 'Bubby', 'extremely', 'easy', 'unnatural', 'way', 'getting', 'involved', 'kinds', 'people', 'situations', 'guy', 'who', 'very', 'few', 'words', 'mostly', 'repeating', 'what', 'others', 'say', 'homeless', 'person', 'guess', 'wild', 'unkept', 'long', 'balding', 'hair.Yet', 'Bubby', 'one', 'night', 'people', 'drive', 'around', 'rock', 'band', 'grow', 'extremely', 'fast', 'popularity.Only', 'last', 'relationship', 'Bubby', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'due', 'being', 'major', 'spoiler', 'manner', 'central', 'story', ""n't"", 'just', 'happen', 'story', 'interact', 'lot', 'random', 'people.One', 'most', 'unrealistic', 'interactions', 'Bubby', 'when', 'group', 'women', 'singing', 'Bubby', 'up', 'Then', 'feeling', 'breasts', 'did', 'mother', 'just', 'gently', 'stop', 'last', 'one', 'smiles', 'next', 'scene', 'getting', 'beautiful', 'young', 'babe', 'Yeah', 'right', 'wish', 'world', 'worked', 'way', 'sadly', 'problem', 'movie', 'cliched', 'evil', 'religious', 'zealots', 'who', 'are', 'Bubby', 'constant', 'only', 'villians', 'Bubby', 'mother', 'warned', 'Jesus', 'was', 'watching', 'when', 'left', 'religious', 'parents', 'viciously', 'character', 'telling', 'God', 'fat', 'people', '.The', 'positives', 'movie', 'are', 'rewarding', 'ending', 'again', 'wo', ""n't"", 'describe', 'due', 'not', 'wanting', 'reveal', 'spoilers', 'unique', 'entertaining', 'style', 'movie.It', 'really', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'amazing', 'could', 'assemble', 'cast', 'willing', 'do', 'different', 'unattractive', 'roles', 'such', 'Bubby', 'fat', 'incestrous', 'unattractive', 'mother', 'mentally', 'handicapped', 'Bubby', 'etc.It', 'definitely', 'worth', 'watching', 'style', 'entertaining', 'unique', 'However', 'be', 'prepared', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'liberally', 'Bubby', 'world']",N/A

It has stayed with me for a week now, I keep thinking about it.  The beginning is the hardest to watch, as it begins with Bubby being held captive by his mother (as described on the plot summary) and yes, it's very disturbing.  But then the film shifts and surprised me by taking a more positive tone, comic and even sweet.  Bubby wanders through a number of strange experiences and interactions and rather like a darker version of Forest Gump, we learn about our world and ourselves through his experiences.  Yes, there are some very dark themes in this film, such as murder, incest, and lots and lots of victimization, but there is also plenty of humor and love too.  There is a part where Bubby comes into contact with a group of adults with severe disabilities, and that part of the film was extremely sweet and uplifting (to me).  So...if you are on the fence about seeing this film because of the disturbing themes, you might want to try it anyway.

The first twenty minutes of the film which illustrate how the character has spent the first several decades of his life are some of the best cinema out there.  I was blown away.  The rest of the movie is a little more ponderous and has a little too much social criticism for my tastes.  Taken all together this is definitely a must watch movie.  It has been described as a cult classic but I think this description underestimates the broad potential appeal of the film.  It is really haunting and has stuck with me for a long time after viewing.  It should inspire low budget film makers everywhere as it rocks your world with just about no art direction or large production values.  The movie isn't perfect and I'm not sure I will be watching it again any time soon but I have recommended it to all of my friends and now to amazon shoppers.
