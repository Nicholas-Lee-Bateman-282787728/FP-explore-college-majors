1202033,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B001HQZJMU,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[0, 1]","At first when I was going into watching this film, I thought it was going suck miserably likeIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc)(George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, I will never forgive you!). In fact, I thought it was going to be worse which is pretty hard to do considering how bad Indy 4 was. Within twenty minutes of watching it, it bore the worst of my fears; Cheesy dialogue, an incoherent storyline, and overly over-the-top action. But then, something amazing happened; it got good. It's certainly no masterpiece of any sort, but I managed to get wrapped up in this film's unabashed fun kind of stupid. It was absolutely preposterous and ridiculous, yet I enjoyed it for this.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When the O'Connell family accidentally raises a mummy of an evil Chinese Emperor, it's up to the family along with a couple of other friends to stop the evil emperor and prevent him from enslaving and taking over the entire world. Their journey takes them to places all over Asia fighting legions of enemies (Both alive and undead).MUSIC: The film has the usual adventure score as you'd expect from a film and it is pretty good.ACTING: Oh, this area is really bad. The dialogue is very cheesy and is definitely B-movie quality. I wished Rachel Weisz returned for this film because I do not like the woman they got to replace her as Evie. By the way, how did the O'Connell's son develop an American accent since the last film? He had a British accent in the last one. Only Jet Li and maybe a couple of other actors seemed to know what they were doing. At least this film has the funny kind of bad acting that's very entertaining to see.ACTION: As the film goes along, you can't help but think, ""Did they make this up as they went along?"" Answer: Probably. The film is absolutely ridiculous on every level from the hot Asian chick being able to summon abominable snowmen to aid in their battle in the Himalayas to the giant battle with an army of the undead, the film makes no sense. But that's why it's so much fun to watch. Action-packed excitement at every turn even if it is ludicrous. Lots of explosions, lots of gun battles, lots of undead battles, martial arts fighting scenes, and more.OVERALL: A very cautionary rental. As you can see this film has received deeply mixed reviews. If you're a person who can take a laid-back approach to films and enjoy them for their popcorn entertainment, this may be for you. If you're expecting a grand adventure film with a grand plot, you're not getting one. Rent it. Although, if you're looking for the closest thing to a modern Indiana Jones I will recommend you seeLara Croft Two Pack (Tomb Raider/The Cradle of Life) - Widescreen.THE GOOD: Lots of cool over-the-top action and music.THE BAD: No coherent storyline, bad acting, and hammy dialogue.",3,OUTRAGEOUS AND GLEEFULLY DUMB FUN! 7 OUT OF 10,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",2009,2823,"['first', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'watching', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'suck', 'miserably', 'likeIndiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'Skull', 'Single', 'Disc', 'George', 'Lucas', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'will', 'never', 'forgive', 'fact', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'worse', 'pretty', 'hard', 'do', 'considering', 'how', 'bad', 'Indy', '4', 'was', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'watching', 'bore', 'worst', 'fears', 'Cheesy', 'dialogue', 'incoherent', 'storyline', 'overly', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'then', 'something', 'amazing', 'happened', 'got', 'good', 'certainly', 'masterpiece', 'sort', 'managed', 'get', 'wrapped', 'up', 'film', 'unabashed', 'fun', 'kind', 'stupid', 'was', 'absolutely', 'preposterous', 'ridiculous', 'yet', 'enjoyed', 'this.WHAT', 'IT', 'ABOUT', 'When', ""O'Connell"", 'family', 'accidentally', 'mummy', 'evil', 'Chinese', 'Emperor', 'up', 'family', 'couple', 'other', 'friends', 'stop', 'evil', 'emperor', 'prevent', 'enslaving', 'taking', 'over', 'entire', 'world', 'journey', 'places', 'Asia', 'fighting', 'legions', 'enemies', 'alive', 'undead', '.MUSIC', 'film', 'usual', 'adventure', 'score', ""'d"", 'expect', 'film', 'pretty', 'good.ACTING', 'Oh', 'area', 'really', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'very', 'cheesy', 'definitely', 'B-movie', 'quality', 'wished', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'returned', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'woman', 'got', 'replace', 'Evie', 'way', 'how', 'did', ""O'Connell"", 'son', 'develop', 'American', 'accent', 'last', 'film', 'had', 'British', 'accent', 'last', 'one', 'Only', 'Jet', 'Li', 'maybe', 'couple', 'other', 'actors', 'seemed', 'know', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'least', 'film', 'funny', 'kind', 'bad', 'acting', 'very', 'entertaining', 'see.ACTION', 'film', 'along', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'Did', 'make', 'up', 'went', 'along', 'Answer', 'Probably', 'film', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'level', 'hot', 'Asian', 'chick', 'being', 'able', 'summon', 'abominable', 'snowmen', 'aid', 'battle', 'Himalayas', 'giant', 'battle', 'army', 'undead', 'film', 'sense', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'watch', 'Action-packed', 'excitement', 'turn', 'even', 'ludicrous', 'Lots', 'explosions', 'lots', 'gun', 'battles', 'lots', 'undead', 'battles', 'martial', 'arts', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'more.OVERALL', 'very', 'cautionary', 'rental', 'can', 'see', 'film', 'received', 'deeply', 'mixed', 'reviews', ""'re"", 'person', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'laid-back', 'approach', 'films', 'enjoy', 'popcorn', 'entertainment', 'may', 'be', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'grand', 'adventure', 'film', 'grand', 'plot', ""'re"", 'not', 'getting', 'one', 'Rent', ""'re"", 'looking', 'closest', 'thing', 'modern', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'will', 'recommend', 'seeLara', 'Croft', 'Two', 'Pack', 'Tomb', 'Raider/The', 'Cradle', 'Life', 'Widescreen.THE', 'GOOD', 'Lots', 'cool', 'over-the-top', 'action', 'music.THE', 'BAD', 'coherent', 'storyline', 'bad', 'acting', 'hammy', 'dialogue']",N/A

Having recently watched a program on the first emperor Qin Shi Huang Di I can see where many of the plot lines on the Emperor come from and as a piece of escapist tosh it's OK. But it really isn't as good as it should have been:-1.The new Evie hasn't got the deftness of touch that Rachel Weisz had and as a result the light hearted banter between her and Rick that was such fun in the first two movies and lifted them out of the ordinary just falls flat here. Whatever her acting abilities may be Maria Bello can't do Evelyn O'Connell.2.Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li are woefully underutilized.3.Alex who was English in the second movie is suddenly very American, go figure.4.The music in the first two movies was grandiose overblown almost in the tradition of Lawrence of Arabia, it added hugely to the ambiance. The soundtrack to Dragon King is just by the numbers, totally anonymous and adds nothing.5.Transportation, the aircraft used is a Bristol Beaufighter, a two seat strike fighter noted for its cramped accommodation, chances of fitting six people and a yak in one without first passing them through a liquidizer is nil. Still I suppose it's an improvement on a jet propelled balloon.6.The Dragon kings Dragon form looks rather too much like King Ghidorah from the Godzilla movies and very little like a Chinese Imperial dragon.What's the moral of this, well I suppose when your script causes sufficient problems that one of the stars drops out and you can't get the proven Director on board, it really is time to pause and rethink. Ploughing ahead bull headed leaves you with a second rate product, an angry client&egrave;le and possibly a dead franchise.

First, the recasting of Evelyn O'Connell was a bad decision.  Nothing against Maria Bello, who is an excellent actress, but she just wasn't right for the role.  I know Rachel Weisz wasn't interested in returning to the franchise, but it almost would have been better if the character was just written out of the film. Second, I just never bought Luke Ford as Alex O'Connell; I mean, how does a kid raised in England grow up to have an American accent?  Now, the film wasn't all bad.

1202039,AK0CENM3LUM28,B001HQZJMU,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]","The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor / B001HQZJMU*Spoilers*I love The Mummy series, but this addition is simply terrible - a lazy retread of of its predecessors in hopes of wringing a few more dollars out of this franchise.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor seems one of those Hollywood movies devoted to making marriage look as pleasant as a root canal. Rick and Evie have stopped being passionate soul-mates who carefully balance their exploratory endeavors with less dangerous, but no less interesting pursuits (as in the second Mummy movie) and have, instead, been turned into the stereotypical empty-nest drudgery marriage. Evie no longer manages museums and attracts the praise of the historical community - she writes historical romances where she (disturbingly) has re-envisioned the most horrifying moments of her life as sexually exciting events. Really, my gorge rose when Evie tried to make the scene where she had been tied down next to a writhing, rotting mummy with a dagger poised over her heart as an erotic game to entice her tired husband to bed. Evie doesn't need an adventure - she needs counseling.(Or perhaps it is the director who needs the counseling - the odd sexual connotations keep coming over and over through the course of this movie. Alex (a grown man now) confesses to his mother that he is not a virgin and she brightens in relief and asks chirpily ""How many?"" partners he has had, and seems positively panting for details. And Alex and his dad, Rick, spend far too much time arguing that ""size matters"" when it comes to...guns.)Once the marital bickering is over and the action starts, we are treated to a lame, lazy retread of the first two movies. The motivations of the mummy are boring and trite without the depth of the previous movies (I preferred the motivation of 'true love' to a plain, straightforward ""Megalomaniac Seeks Immortality"" reading).Oh, yes, and there's also a vomit scene. Do you know what made the other Mummy movies genuinely good flicks instead of soulless retreads? A lack of vomit, among other things.

Exciting movies perhaps, but they feel so... bombastic and fake.This movie is no exception, but something about it is more appealing to me compared to all those Indiana Jones and James Bond films. The visual effects are pretty stunning, I know that much. The snowmen/ape creatures were unique, the transformations involving the main mummy were VERY well done and looked stunning to be completely honest, and the story was good enough that I'd call it enjoyable.Even the army of creatures with swords that we saw at the end of the movie were pretty fun, though it was hard to believe only a few people were able to take ALL of them out, haha. But they were so WEIRD looking, and every time their heads would be chopped off I'd sit there amazed how cool it looked. This is one beautiful movie.Maybe I should check out more movies with a similar feel and style and not just write them off as ""terrible"" so quickly, because honestly, these kind of storylines CAN in fact be enjoyable given some time to adjust to the overall whacky style the writers must have been going for.

Some say Brendan Fraser mailed in a lame performance, I disagree. Yes, Rachel Weisz declined to do this movie. My opinion, they should have said she died, and that Brendan's and Maria Bello's character fall in love. There was chemistry there, And I have to say. I enjoyed her a whole lot better than Rachel's interpretation of the character, the cow in the plane scene. Yeah, again could've done without it. But as a whole, Jet-Li is the scariest Mummy. Plus it's set in China, where yes, there are mummies there too. I think the major problem with this movie, is that by the time this movie came out, people had gotten tired of the series. And all they saw was Brendan Fraser as Dudley Doo right, and that's a shame. Because this movie was much much much better than the second one. And to answer a negative reviewer, the o'connells boy is now a tombraider of sorts, kind of like his dad. And as they're tracking the mummy in the mountains, he tells his mother that he's not a virgin. She asks him ""oh really how many"", now some have taken that as to say that she was crazy in a perverse way. But in reality, she was trying to keep her family together.

1202050,A2SZ86FLBMZPLL,B001HQZJMU,"B. Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[0, 2]","For those of you who have read my reviews (for which I am grateful, by the way), you will undoubtedly have noticed the trend for these that has emerged over the time since I began writing them.  Initially, they consisted of two or more paragraphs which gave a general description of the film/s plot, followed by some commentary of the film's production aspects such as acting, writing, directing, etc.  Over time, the reviews grew longer and had more baroque lead-in & transitional paragraphs, accompanied by elements of editorial commentary.For this review, I will try to keep the commentary (relatively) brief and won't incorporate lengthy editorializing:THE MUMMY (1999) was a very creative and interesting film with a fantastic trailer, a great script, and very good dialogue.  It was a suspenseful action film that was able to ably integrate elements of horror and humor.  The acting was very effective all-around.  This highly effective combination made for not only an enjoyable film and impressive cinematic achievement, but is one of the few that could claim the overused and often undeserved title of ""New Classic"".The first sequel (2001) was less clever and at least a little annoying.  The funniest (unintentionally) part of the film was the central notion to the theme of the wife suddenly becoming aware of ""oh that's right, I just remembered that I am a reincarnation of the evil queen's main rival and can take her on in a highly stylized and well-choreographed fight scene"".  It was literally almost that blatant.  In addition to the substitution of excessive CG effects in place of a well-written story, the film also had the clich&eacute;d stereotype of the whiney/frightened Black sidekick.Its second sequel (2008's THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR) had a poor script, bad acting (from good actors, which means lousy directing) and was just a lame and somewhat tedious & tired film altogether.  The lead actress was replaced (Maria Bello for Rachel Weisz), which was the closest thing to good acting (seeing Maria Bello do a passable British character).  Otherwise, it was wholly implausible that the two main characters were parents to an adult son.  All dialogue between the son (Luke Ford) and the cute Asian good quasi-ninjette (Isabella Leong) consisted of loud and campy declarative affectations that came straight out of a bad Neil Simon play (is there any other kind?) or a 1930's film.  Brendan Frazier's dialogue was reduced to stock theater gruntings as if lifted from a 1940's or 50's film.  John Hannah was reduced to saying loud bewailments every time he spoke.  The addition of Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li was ostensibly for some impressive chop-socky action scenes, even though both are average and subpar actors respectively.  In fact, there was only a brief wire-fu sequence which was a long way from impressive.  The story was banal and insipid.  In spite of some impressive visuals, the film just wasn't all that good.The first film required a significant suspension of disbelief, but was a competently written & filmed story.  What all three have in common is the idiotic notion that an evil guy will be banished in death with a terrible curse which is somehow escapable, and allows that he will have super powers once he comes back to life.  How about in place of a super-curse, you just kill the guy and make sure he stays dead or powerless.  I suppose that is just navely wishful thinking...By the way, the last line of the film suggests there's a fair to decent chance there will be another sequel.

Maria Bello takes over the role of Evie, Rick's love and wife, and I think may have better chemistry with Brendan Fraser (at least in the stage of long time married couple), than Rachel Weisz did. I very much liked Rachel in the role in the first two movies, but her agent reportedly said of this one that ""Rachel will NEVER play the role of the mother of a grown son!"" I personally think that was a mistake, as film today is full of mature female characters in exciting and sexy roles. That attitude was more at home in the 1940s than in the 21st century. Maria Bello is charming and believable in the role, and with her performance I quickly forgot that it wasn't Rachel Weisz ... probably a second reason why it was a bad idea for Rachel to turn down a blockbuster role ... for what?Brendan Fraser is his normal mummy-slaying self. There is nothing new from him in this role, but if you enjoyed the first two films, you really need nothing new from him in this one. He is heroic and entertaining in the role, and that's what we were looking for here.Luke Ford is competent and exciting as the now grown son, Alex. He and Isabella Leong develop a believable chemistry after a rocky start to their relationship.Here we have an ancient Chinese Emperor coming back to life, with the immediate goal of restoring his army along with him so that he may rule the world. I think that calling him a mummy might have been a bit of a stretch, but he does indeed provide an evil and formidable foe for our heroes to deal with. I found the story to have a few surprising choices, which is rare in an action/adventure/monster story. Cool elements such as yetis battling a modern Chinese army abound, and as mentioned above, the ultimate battle between reanimated CGI armies is both interesting and well rendered.I understand that there are a lot of fans of the first two movies that found this one lacking. I do agree that the first was the best, as is often the case in a series. However, I think the third installment measures up very well as compared to the second. I look to be entertained by an action film, and I certainly was here. The picture and sound on the Blu-ray is outstanding, which helps a lot all in itself!

The characters seem to be mere extensions of the old action movie clich&eacute;s of the past with Brendan Fraser being the tough talking action hero, and John Hannah being the wimpy slimeball who always survives thanks to the heroes. I have to be thruthful and say I've never watched the first two Mummy movies in their entirety, I have only caught them either at the middle or the end but I have loved every bit I've seen.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I'm guessing is set a few years after the last Mummy movie due to their son Alex now being about 25. Alex is now an explorer and is in search of the tomb of Dragon Emperor Han. He finds it but finds he's being pursued by Chinese soldiers wanting to bring the frozen emperor back to life so that he can bring China back to greatness. Alex's parents the legendary Richard and Evelyn O'connell are employed by the British government to take the ancient Chinese relic The Eye of Shangri-La back to China as a sign of good will. Unfortunately not all goes to plan and the Eye is stolen and used to awaken the emperor by General Yang.Over the course of the film after the emperors awakening follows a number of fast paced action scenes, very well choreographed fighting and some stellar special effects. The Mummy films have always been known for their epic size in particular scenes including the massive battles that usually take place near the end. This film is no exception to that rule and seeks to push the epic size further and further. The look of the Emperor before he takes back his human form is shockingly realistic, the CGI chase scene blended with the real life chasers is amazing and flawless. The acting I have to be honest is a bit ""meh"" but you don't watch such a movie expecting 5 star acting, yet I so want Brendan Fraser to come out with some excellent acting talent.I would highly recommend this to all fans of the Mummy movies as it keeps true to the original style and feel of the past ones.

I am being generous giving it three and a half stars mainly because of Li's acting and the new storyline in China. My wife and I felt this was a decent action but it needed Rachel Wiesz badly. The replacement of a main character is never easy and in this case I think they should have waited to make the movie until Wiesz was available. Her replacement, Maria Bello, did not show the special personality quirks, warmth, and depth that endeared us to Wiesz in the first two movies. The movie is a fair action sequel with lots of great scenes of fighting, but it feels strained and misses the fun of the first two. So if you want just action without the warmth of love exhibited in the first two you will probably not be disappointed. In this sequel the O'Connells, lead by their son Alex, fight a risen Chinese emperor. They endeavor to stop him from becoming immortal and raising his army. This feat requires enlisting the aid of a beautiful woman that has guarded the emperors tomb and a pool at Shagri La for centuries. She calls upon abominable snowmen and those killed by the emperor to assist them but the emperor controls all the elements and is a formidable opponent.

It is just supposed to be silly fun.  Do you like mummies?  If so, then you get to see it all again here, but on the other side of the world.

While I thought Bello played Evelyn O'Connell just fine, the rest of my family disliked the change intensely.  They probably should not have made the change.  While Jet Li's character has a big role in the movie, he has a small part, because most of the time Emperor Han is a computer generated monster.  But Jet Li's name was supposed to sell tickets.

So, maybe it worked well for the producers when seen from a global perspective.  $392 million total box office (before DVD sales and other licensing rights) is pretty solid even with the disappointing domestic take.  I thought the plot point of having the son all grown up and a bit troubled was a nice addition and Luke Ford does a good job as Alex.Whether or not you should see this movie is entirely based on how well you tolerate light sweets with no nutritional value.  Sometimes you feel like a candy bar instead of a salad.  I enjoyed it for what it aimed to be, but won't make any effort at all to remember it or think about what the movie ""was about"".

I gave it 4 stars only because the production was very well done, and it was never meant to be anything but escapist entertainment. With that in mind, it's a decent movie.It's rated PG-13. I'll honestly never ever understand the MPAA. It's a mild PG-13 rating, there's one sort of uncomfortable for younger kids scene where the wife appears in her silk nightgown and talks about seducing her husband (she does remove the nightgown to reveal fairly tame lingerie), but he's snoring in a chair.

Brendan Fraser still plays the role excellently and, if there is an unfortunate sequel, I hope he continues with the role. While most people found Maria Bello a bad choice to replace Rachel Weisz, I wasn't bothered by it. Not as much at least when they replaced Dick York with Dick Sargeant on Bewitched. Bello had her own interpretation of the character and she delivered. Jet Li was an interesting choice for a mummy and I wish the actual actor featured more in it but the few scenes he was in were good, but the Emperor seemed to be a stronger villain than Imhoptep. Though the emotional conflict which Imhotep possessed is missed. Michelle Yeoh, again for the few scenes she was in were good, the fight with Jet Li being the best. The supporting cast however is where this movie fails. The supporters of the villain (along with their goal) is too generic, the son doesn't even resemble the character from the second film and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter is stiff. But the special effects are excellent, the final sequence being the standout. The chase in Shanghai is good but drags a bit.

1202076,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B001HQZJMU,Dave. K,"[1, 4]","After 7-years The Mummy franchise returns, but with a few changes; Stephen Sommers who wrote and directed the first 2 returns only as producer and half the cast is gone, but the character of Evelyn returns only played by Maria Bello rather than Rachel Weisz. Anyone that knows me pretty much knows that in general I'm not one for big Hollywood movies for the most part. Since the mid 90s Hollywood has really been putting out some lousy flicks. Prior to that I Hollywood movies were fairly good overall, but I have to admit I really enjoyed The Mummy franchise. The first two were not great movies, but were highly entertaining.But going into The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor my expectations were quite low. With new writers and a new director plus half the cast being gone I was hoping for something decent, but I didn't expect much, but Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was quite a surprise. While it's inferior to the previous two flicks in its own right it was enjoyable even with the flaws.The script by Alfred Gough & Miles Miller was alright; it's never as amusing as the previous parts, but it does stay true to the franchise and mostly relies on the viewers knowing the characters. Overall the characters are just sort of there and they don't have the excellent character moments that had in the previous two, but like those movies the characters are still a lot of fun. The script could have used a touch up and it's pretty much your standard Hollywood action screenplay, but overall it serves its purpose.I was never really much of a fan of director Rob Cohen, while he's done some decent movies personally I always find them slightly lacking and despite the flaws with The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor I'd say this is probably his best work thus far. While never as witty or creative as Stephen Sommers, Rob Cohen does get the job done on delivering a highly entertaining movie even with the flaws. The pacing was solid and there really are no slow moments and Cohen keeps the movie fun from the beginning to end.I've liked Brendan Fraser ever since I saw Encino Man; what I like about him is he has this average everyday guy look rather than big Hollywood look and he's a lot better of an actor than he's given credit for. And once again Fraser is the man; I just love the character of Rick O'Connell and Fraser plays the part perfectly. This time around he doesn't have the great character moments like he did in the first two, but Fraser still makes the best out of it and delivers another solid performance and again is quite funny.Maria Bello takes over the role of Evelyn O'Connell and does very well in the role. Personally I like Maria Bello more than Rachel Weisz, but I do think Rachel was a bit better as Evelyn, but Maria Bello is good enough and the movie doesn't suffer due to the re-casting of the role. John Hannah returns as Jonathan and this time around he seems to be here just for the sake of it. John Hannah stole the show in the first two and he almost does again, but he's just not given enough to do.Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh are welcome additions to the cast even if not used to their full potential. You have Li and Yeoh in a movie and they aren't allowed to really showcase their skills, which was a shame. They do have a brief fight scene that while a bit disappointing fans of these two will still surly enjoy it just due to the fact it's Li Vs Yeoh. But both are underused for sure they never really get to showcase their skills, but both are still excellent.The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is getting a lot of poor reviews and I'm not exactly sure why. While the first two movies were extremely fun I wouldn't say they were these epic classic films. They were simply fun and while yes this movie isn't as good it still serves its purpose as mindless entertainment just like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Again while inferior The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor still serves its purpose as a fun flick.As fun as the movie was the franchise is running out of steam; the biggest flaw with the movie was really due to the fact there was nothing that could really be added to the concept, but I do think this series might still have a little bit of life left in it. Despite the mostly negative reviews I enjoyed The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, while inferior to the first two its still a fun ride that is far better than the reviews out there.

No, when are sequels better than originals - not too often.Is this any good ? Yes. Its a fun ride for 100 minutes. This time it's a Mummy from Shangri-La. There are some cool CGI SPFX -of monsters and Yeti and the action is more or less non stop. Jet Li becoming a 3 headed dragon and some other monster is very cool, the SPFX were great here. It is the same formula as the first 2 Mummy movies, witty dialog (some of the lines come up short) and just a lot of explosions and effects. The acting is perfectly fine for a movie like this. The love interest is non existent. It doesn't need to be the big story in this kind of movie. This is a movie that is meant to entertain you with action and effects, not to be a downer with a sad ending, not about love. The characters were all good enough for this kind of picture. And boy does this deliver, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It did what it set out to do entertain you with non stop action- 4 stars for a movie of this sort. Leave your brains at the door when you watch this, this is just to sit back and enjoy.These movies remind me so much of Indiana Jones that I wish Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser would team up to fight a Mummy with a treasure thrown in.

If you've seen any ""Mummy"" movie, you'll know that it takes a straightforward plot; you get a back story of how said mummy becomes that way, his rise from the dead, and then it's up to the O'Connell's to send that mummy back to where he came from.There are some familiar faces in ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", Brendan Fraser reprises his role of Rick O'Connell and John Hannah returns as Jonathan.  Then you have Maria Bello replacing Rachel Weisz as Evelyn and Luke Ford assuming the role of a much older Alex O'Connell.  This actor switch is where the minor irregularities come in.  Bello's replacement of Weisz is very noticeable and her British accent needs a lot of work.  And Ford's portrayal of the older Alex is sans the British accent he had in the second film.  Again, they are minor flaws, but flaws nonetheless.Everything else was pretty much the same as any of the other two ""Mummy"" films.  You had car chases, airborne chases, plenty of shooting, tidbits of humor, lots and lots of mummies, and the same old ending.  ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" doesn't break new ground, but if you enjoyed any other film in the trilogy, you'll like this one.  It's not as good as the first, but much better than the second.

As he is about to unveil his find to the public, his parents show up for an unexpected visit while bringing back an artifact to the Chinese government. The artifact, unknown to the O'Connells, is actually the key to freeing The Dragon Emperor from his curse! Many attempted twists and turns on this one.To be honest, the back story about Jet-Li's character is the probably the BEST part of the whole film! After that, the plot gets iffy! As I said earlier, it has its moments but overall it comes out very weak. While Jet Li is usually very good, I never felt like he was a real threat in this one. As for the actress that filled in for Rachel Weize as Evelyn O'Connell, I kind of felt sorry for her because she was stepping into a role that was made so good by Rachel.

The 2nd lightened up the tone, replacing most of the horror with a great sense of humor; of course, it was a retread of the first, but it was probably best of the series because it was the most entertaining.

I wasn't expecting much from The Mummy 3: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor - but I was pleasantly surprised when the film started off strongly with a bang - taking its audience from Ancient China to 20th century Shanghai.With slam-bang action, sweeping visuals, pace, sharp visuals...Director Rob Cohen does a good job of manning the helm.  This is pretty much saturday matinee theatre pulp fiction for a new generation.For one thing, this was leaps and bounds better than Indiana Jones 4; Tomb Raider and other adventurer attempts.  To set it in China was definitely inspired as well, although the Chinese people didn't appreciate the liberties taken with their history.The film gets a little loose later on - as the stakes never quite remain as high as we need them to be for some reason.  You feel like the filmmakers are holding on to the PG version of events as opposed to making it work for both an adult and young audience.  So some hokeyness creeps in dialogue-wise, and that is where the film despite resplendent visual fx - loses its grip.  The characters never quite rise to the fore and the zombie terracotta warriors end up being more Jar Jar Binks than terrifying, so that's another problem.  The Yetis are also overly nimble and friendly  like Wookees on steroids.Jet Li's character could have certainly been more menacing as well - a wasted opportunity.  He just snarls and gnarls. Several ""what-if"" scenarios start to enter the viewer's mind.  Make me care! was what I was thinking.  But what we get is more fx.The other criticism is that Brendan Fraser has to share the leading role with his screen son - and he isn't even looking like a dad of a grown man yet.

1202108,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001HQZJMU,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 4]","2.5 stars.Film critic Roger Ebert hails THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR as the best of this series, and I guess that's why we have opinions. I happen to think that this third entry, while somewhat entertaining, is not as good as the first two films, not even close. This series, obviously more inspired by the Indiana Jones franchise than the Boris Karloff stuff, has never had the resonance or the pure rush of high adventure which made the first three Indy Jones flicks so memorable. And yet TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR has echoes of what I liked about the first two Mummy films. It's a silly movie, but it knows it's silly and invites you to embrace its campiness. Me, I liked the ride, up to a point.Catching up with the O'Connells: It's 1946, and Rick and Evelyn O'Connell have fallen into a dreaded state, that of staid domesticity. Their adventuring days well behind them, Rick now whiles his time in incompetent fly-fishing, while Evie's writing career has stalled on writer's block. Oh, and their romance has gone in the way of ""meh..."" So how can't they help but perk up when the British Foreign Office offers them a mission of couriering a sacred relic back to the Chinese people. So off they go.Seems to me that this particular mummy menace can be blamed on Rick and Evie's rebellious 20-year-old son Alex. Boy's followed his mother's scholarly ways and has become an archaeologist. And, even if he doesn't do the actual resurrecting, it's Alex who in China unearths the 2000-year-old Emperor and his army of terra-cotta warriors. Alex may not get on well with his dad, but, still, when an ancient evil warlord returns to life and dreams again of conquest, it's nice that one's parents have experience with stopping that sort of thing.There may not be any pyramids in this one, but there are still tombs and sarcophagi. Perhaps to reinvigorate this series, the venue and mythology shift from Egypt to China, and, so, we get dragons and wushu, Shangri-La and yetis in the frozen Himalayas (who evidently are down with American football). The film also offers the possible (but kinda sketchy) origin of the Great Wall of China. But you know what? I miss the mummy Imhotep and I miss Oded Fehr as the grim, face-tattooed warrior who guards against the mummy's awakening. And I really miss Rachel Weisz. The quite unexpected choice to fill in as Evie is American actress Maria Bello and she actually does a fair job. But, no, it's not the same. On the other hand, Brendan Fraser is back as Rick O'Connell, and he's still got that affable, big lug charm. John Hannah is the other returnee, as Evie's greedy but likable brother Jonathan. Jonathan is now a thriving nightclub owner in Shanghai, which is very good news for the plot. He's still the predominant comic foil, which is one more dead horse these filmmakers don't mind beating.Another thing to tsk tsk about is that the movie doesn't take full advantage of the martial arts talents of Eastern icons Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li. Jet Li is particularly wasted, as his character is mostly camouflaged in CG effects. I'll yell it to the world, brother: Jet Li, being already a human highlight, does NOT need CG effects! At least, in THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM, Jet Li has a fantastic one-off with Jackie Chan. And it would've been nice if Yeoh's character, the immortal sorceress Zi Yuan, had been allowed a reunion moment with her dead General, but the film was too eager to get to the two undead armies engaging in the fighty fight already. It's also a bit ironic that TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR came out the same summer as the fourth Indiana Jones, of that franchise this Mummy series has strived to emulate (but never quite surpassed). And like THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, there's an annoying youngster trying to upstage the old bull. Luke Ford plays Rick and Evie's son Alex with the appeal of someone clinically dead. This guy has zero chemistry with absolutely everyone and everything in this film. I guess it's a truimph of sorts that I don't find Alex as exasperating as Shia LeBeouf's Mutt (don't get me started on that vine swinging %$##).This one simply lacks the scale, romance and panache (okay, campy panache) of the first two Mummy films. Coming out the same summer as IRON MAN, HELLBOY 2, DARK KNIGHT and, dammit, yes, even MAMMA MIA, TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR never really stood a chance. Factor in the stale storytelling, the lame dialogue, Rachel Weisz's absence, and the misuse of Jet Li and, well, you can see why Weisz chose not to dig up her role again. As for Brendan Fraser, he's a nice guy but I wouldn't be surprised if he's up for sequels to MONKEYBONE or BEDAZZLED.",3,Musty!

Walczak ""Lomitus""","[1, 1]","You would think after all the truly disastrous sequels that have been done over the years, that movie makers would learn one basic rule; if you have to replace a primary character because the actor/actress is unavailable, either write the character out of the script or simply don't do the movie.  You'd think that Brendon Fraser would have known this lesson as he skillfully avoided the horror that was ""George of the Jungle 2"".  How many otherwise promising sequels have be ruined because the producers decided it was better to take short cuts?  This is my first and biggest gripe about ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"".I won't reiterate all the details of this movie and it's failings...if you're reading this, you can easily get that from the other reviews already here.  I do have a few specific issues though that I feel need to be mentioned.  While I'm sure that otherwise Maria Bello is a fine actress, she simply did NOT have the on-screen chemistry with Brendon Fraser that Rachel Weisz did as the character Evelyn O'Connell.  As ANY good movie buff can tell you, aside from writing and story plots, it's the chemistry between the actors as the characters that will make or break a movie.  The interaction between Fraser and Bello in this incarnation of ""The Mummy"" just seems forced at best and there really is no chemistry to speak of.  This in and of itself seriously diminishes Fraser's performance to little more than ""I really can't believe I needed the money this badly"".The idea behind this plot and script held a great deal of promise.  Instead of rehashing the previous two movies (particularly after the period of time that has elapsed), this new idea...and new ""Mummy"" had some potential.  It's one of those concepts that probably seemed like a really good idea at the time but the execution was very poor and came off more as the movie makers just trying to cash in on a previously successful franchise without having to put a great deal of effort into it.  While the performance of the ""new"" characters in this movie are very good, the main characters of ""Rick O'Connell"", his companions and their exploits for which this series is based are simply very poor and not strong enough to carry the movie at all.Again I won't go into the details of the plot but I have to honestly say that this movie wasn't worth the $1 I payed to rent it and it's certainly NOT worth the cost of purchase.

Maria Bello takes over the role of Evelyn from Rachel Weisz. Outstanding inThe CoolerandA History of Violence, Bello is asked to play a light beer version of the rugged female action star, an ancestor to Sigourney Weaver'sRipleyor Linda Hamilton'sSarah Connor.Bello and Fraser are joined by their son, Alex (Luke Ford). Ford is miscast, too close in age to Fraser and their relationship is clich&eacute; (Indiana Jones, for example, used that particular plot device twice). Additionally, Alex and Lin (Isabella Leong) share little chemistry.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor marks an anniversary of sorts for Jet Li, who played the bad guy in the sloppy sequel,Lethal Weapon 4, ten years ago. Most moviegoers in 1998 hadn't yet witnessed Jet Li's martial art skills. Riggs and Murtaugh were tired and bloated but Jet Li almost single-handedly made Lethal Weapon 4 worth watching.This time around, not even Jet Li can save the sequel.There are as many reasons as plot holes why this sequel doesn't charm like the original, even allowing for the absent logic on which popcorn movies thrive. Haven't had enough exploding CGI mummies? Well, this is your movie. Besides, the international box office for Tomb of the Dragon Emperor ensures another sequel in a couple years (and don't be surprised if the O'Connell family shows up in South America).",2,New faces can't breathe life into tired Mummy sequel,1229299200,"12 15, 2008",2008,1882,"['Line', '2008', 'summer', 'action', 'movies', 'Mummy', 'Tomb', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', ""you-should've-stopped-while-you-were-still-ahead"", 'pile', 'disappointing', 'sequels', 'includesIndiana', 'Jones', 'Kingdom', 'Crystal', 'SkullandThe', 'X-Files', 'Want', 'Believe.OnlyHellboy', 'II', 'Golden', 'Armyavoided', 'same', 'trap', 'offering', 'bigger', 'funnier', 'more', 'exciting', 'installment', 'fairness', 'exceeded', 'drastically', 'lower', 'expectations', 'facing', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Rick', ""O'Connell"", 'Brendan', 'Fraser', '.The', 'third', 'film', 'new', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'role', 'Evelyn', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Outstanding', 'inThe', 'CoolerandA', 'History', 'Violence', 'Bello', 'asked', 'play', 'light', 'beer', 'version', 'rugged', 'female', 'action', 'star', 'ancestor', 'Sigourney', ""Weaver'sRipleyor"", 'Linda', ""Hamilton'sSarah"", 'Connor.Bello', 'Fraser', 'are', 'joined', 'son', 'Alex', 'Luke', 'Ford', 'Ford', 'miscast', 'too', 'close', 'age', 'Fraser', 'relationship', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'example', 'used', 'particular', 'plot', 'device', 'twice', 'Additionally', 'Alex', 'Lin', 'Isabella', 'Leong', 'share', 'little', 'chemistry.Tomb', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'anniversary', 'sorts', 'Jet', 'Li', 'who', 'played', 'bad', 'guy', 'sloppy', 'sequel', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '4', 'ten', 'years', 'ago', 'Most', 'moviegoers', '1998', 'had', ""n't"", 'yet', 'witnessed', 'Jet', 'Li', 'martial', 'art', 'skills', 'Riggs', 'Murtaugh', 'were', 'tired', 'bloated', 'Jet', 'Li', 'almost', 'single-handedly', 'made', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', '4', 'worth', 'watching.This', 'time', 'around', 'not', 'even', 'Jet', 'Li', 'can', 'save', 'sequel.There', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'plot', 'holes', 'why', 'sequel', ""n't"", 'charm', 'original', 'even', 'allowing', 'absent', 'logic', 'popcorn', 'movies', 'thrive', 'Have', ""n't"", 'had', 'enough', 'exploding', 'CGI', 'mummies', 'Well', 'movie', 'international', 'box', 'office', 'Tomb', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'sequel', 'couple', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', ""O'Connell"", 'family', 'up', 'South', 'America']",N/A

Ok, I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let me review the way I know how.  I will tell you who was in the movie.  What the movie was about.  Then my feeling on the movie.I really liked the first mummy movie.  I would probably give it a 4.5 out of 5.  I don't really remember the second one.  Guess I will have to watch it again one day.  But the new film fell short.  This time the movie is about Rick O' Connells son trying to fine treasure.  Then there's a warrior who had a curse put on him that made him and his army turn into statues.  There is a way to lift the curse though.  With the item that O' Connells sun is looking for.  If the people trying to awake the old emperor get the item, The man will awake with his army and try to rule the world.  Sound boring?  You got it.  As stupid as that sounds.  That is the movie.There is a lot of martial arts in the film.  While I like martial arts movies as much as the next guy, it just didn't feel right in this film.  You'll be sitting there watching it and you will forget that your watching a movie about mummies.  On top of the martial arts feeling strange there is SO many things trying to be done at the same time that it starts to overwhelm you.  As soon as you start to understand something and get into it,  five more things happen that by the end will have made you forget all about the things you had started to understand.Then the humor.  While a few things may have made me giggle, by no means did I bust out laughing.  All the laughter seemed like the same old stuff you've seen in the other mummy movies.  It seems to me that they tried to add to much humor in it.  I mean it is a movie about mummies trying to kill people and the world in danger of being over taken by a mad man who will kill anyone who wishes.  It's almost National Lampoonsish.  I know that seems strange but it is.  And maybe it's just me but Brendon Fraser always seems to be straining his voice, trying to make him self sound deeper than he is.  That may just be my ears letting me hear things that are not though.In the end you get a movie that may have been good it is did not have a couple movies head of it.  Making people expect it to be a certain way.  But it does and we do.  As soon as you start watching it you will get the feeling that the makers had a lot more money than they have and they just wanted to make more.  It does not even have the same lady playing the wife.  I don't think the new lady (Maria Bello) who plays his wife, seems unable to act well in this role.

So, I know that Jet Li's movements are authentic and realistic, even though we do not see enough Jet Li in this movie. I also enjoy movies by Jack Lee, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme but, I like Jet Li movies best. In fact, I like Jet Li so much that I would give a movie in which he stars an automatic 5 star. For patrons who are not familiar with Wu Shu (Chinese Kung Fu), I would suggest you buy and watch ""Dragons of the Orient"". Aside from Jet Li, this is a fantastic movie in terms of action sequences, story line and choice of sceneries. In my judgement, all the actors and actresses performed their roles very well. But, I must admit that I am enchanted by the mother. She displays such beautiful British mannerisms that I cannot help but to fall in love with her. I do not want to spoil the story for the patrons, but, in a nutshell, a dragon emperor and his army were cursed by a witch never to be lifted again lest they will enslave the world. But, the archaeologists mistakenly brought the Shang Ri La's eye to China  and awakened the dragon emperor. Then came a race against time to stop the emperor before he could reach the magic pool and raise his army, and then to bring them across a boundary to make them invisible. Incidentally, Michelle Yeoh looks great as the witch.

The scenes with the new female were way out of line from what you would expect from the first two movies. She was more hesitant, mystic in the first two.

Just didn't work.Fourth... the 'comedy relief' lines.... really really didn't work.In summary... don't waste your time. Stick to the first two, they were congruent and flowed nicely together.

I am also a big fan of the mummy series I have the mummy, the mummy returns, the mummy tomb of the dragon emperor and the scorpion king all on blu-ray.  Picture and sound wise Tomb is the best of all of them.  It has a beautiful higdef vido transfor and a equaly good 5.1 DTS HD MA audio track that really creates a good surrond sound field.  There is also a good feature list with some highdef exclusive contant.  So the 2 disc (1 bd 50 gig and a dvd) blu-ray is well put togather and worth the extra $.On to the movie.  When you go to see a movie like this its not for anything new its just to have a good time.  Action comedy/romance films like this generly follow the same formula.  Heros met vilian that seems undefitable and when things look the worst heros dig down trust in each other vilian is defited and heros fall in love and sail into sunset leving a opaning for another movie.  so what really matters is the visuals and the action.  On this Tomb delivers, there are quite a few really good action parts with some martial arts, Street fighting style and sword and gun fights.  There are also some wondeful sets.

This is how the story goes: Explorer Rick O'Connell to combat the resurrected Han Emperor in an epic that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Rick is joined in this all-new adventure by son Alex, wife Evelyn and her brother, Jonathan. And this time, the O'Connells must stop a mummy awoken from a 2,000-year-old curse who threatens to plunge the world into his merciless, unending service. Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor and his 10,000 warriors have laid forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. But when dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, the reckless young archaeologist must seek the help of the only people who know more than he does about taking down the undead: his parents. As the monarch roars back to life, our heroes find his quest for world domination has only intensified over the millennia. Striding the Far East with unimaginable supernatural powers, the Emperor Mummy will rouse his legion as an unstoppable, otherworldly force... unless the O'Connells can stop him first.The directing by Rob Cohen (who also directed ""Stealth"" (2005), ""XXX"" (2002), ""The Fast And The Furious"" (2001), ""Daylight"" (1996), ""Dragonheart"" (1996) & ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" (1993) is great!

Mummy 3 is no different.  There are a lot of fun, great action, and good special effects.  It was fun, maybe dumb fun, but fun nonetheless.  Sure, there are flaws.  Rachel Weisz is sorely missed, and while her replacement is fine, the lack of the original character is noticeable.  Also, the son, now a full grown man, has switched accents, and has some unexplained resentment to his father, which feels it was done for plot purposes.

(Evelyn) If you can't get the whole original cast back for a movie, why bother? These things hardly ever pay off and the chemistry between Brenden Frasier & Maria Bello simply is not there.The plot is that it takes place some time after the last Mummy movie and Evelyn had written 2 successful Mummy books based on there previous 2 adventures and is struggling to find any inspiration for a 3rd book. In her personal life her and husband Richard (Frasier) have settled down and are bored out of there mind when an opportunity to take an amulet to China comes along, where they figure they will deliver it and go see there son who has just uncovered an emperors tomb with his army that was put there after being cursed by a witch.So yadda yadda yadda, the Emperor is freed and they try to stop him from reaching a pool of eternal life to raise his army.It sounds a bit better then it was, as it seemed all the focus was put into the FX of the movie and little in character development, story line or plot. I'm sure anyone watching this in China would wonder why the hell they cast Jet Li in a non martial arts role and why the heck he is fighting abdominal snowmen?In the first 2 mummy movies, there was an excitement of action that they could have ended the movie a long time before they did, but it kept going on getting more exciting and a bigger finale then the last... however this one lacks that completely. The end of the movie just seemed to come, happen and it was over with no big climax to it.And even tho the last 2 movies may have had you suspend disbelief, this one seemed like they would just try anything, no matter how outlandish just to get the movie over and done with.Even Brendan Fraisor shows signs of no interest in being in this movie, as he performers one of his most lamest performances to date with cheap little stale jokes thrown in between with bad timing, or drowned out by the musical score trying to somewhat add live to a flat-lining movie.",2,Tomb of the cash in,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",2009,2228,"['third', 'installment', 'expediently', 'just', 'excuse', 'make', 'more', 'money', 'Mummy', 'franchise', 'flops', 'Scorpion', 'King', '1', '2', 'why', 'not', 'make', '3rd', 'installment', 'led', 'spin', 'offs.The', 'first', 'notably', 'mistake', 'was', 'absence', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'Evelyn', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'whole', 'original', 'cast', 'back', 'movie', 'why', 'bother', 'things', 'hardly', 'ever', 'pay', 'off', 'chemistry', 'Brenden', 'Frasier', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'simply', 'not', 'there.The', 'plot', 'place', 'time', 'last', 'Mummy', 'movie', 'Evelyn', 'had', 'written', '2', 'successful', 'Mummy', 'books', 'based', 'previous', '2', 'adventures', 'struggling', 'find', 'inspiration', '3rd', 'book', 'personal', 'life', 'husband', 'Richard', 'Frasier', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'are', 'bored', 'mind', 'when', 'opportunity', 'take', 'amulet', 'China', 'along', 'where', 'figure', 'will', 'deliver', 'go', 'see', 'there', 'son', 'who', 'just', 'uncovered', 'emperors', 'tomb', 'army', 'was', 'put', 'there', 'being', 'cursed', 'witch.So', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'yadda', 'Emperor', 'freed', 'try', 'stop', 'reaching', 'pool', 'eternal', 'life', 'raise', 'army.It', 'bit', 'better', 'then', 'was', 'seemed', 'focus', 'was', 'put', 'FX', 'movie', 'little', 'character', 'development', 'story', 'line', 'plot', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'watching', 'China', 'would', 'wonder', 'why', 'hell', 'cast', 'Jet', 'Li', 'non', 'martial', 'arts', 'role', 'why', 'heck', 'fighting', 'abdominal', 'snowmen', 'first', '2', 'mummy', 'movies', 'was', 'excitement', 'action', 'could', 'have', 'ended', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'did', 'kept', 'going', 'getting', 'more', 'exciting', 'bigger', 'finale', 'then', 'last', 'however', 'one', 'completely', 'end', 'movie', 'just', 'seemed', 'come', 'happen', 'was', 'big', 'climax', 'it.And', 'even', 'tho', 'last', '2', 'movies', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'one', 'seemed', 'would', 'just', 'try', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'outlandish', 'just', 'get', 'movie', 'done', 'with.Even', 'Brendan', 'Fraisor', 'signs', 'interest', 'being', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'lamest', 'performances', 'date', 'cheap', 'little', 'stale', 'jokes', 'thrown', 'bad', 'timing', 'drowned', 'out', 'musical', 'score', 'trying', 'somewhat', 'add', 'live', 'flat-lining', 'movie']",N/A

Without Rachael Weisz and Oded Fehr (whose character would not have fit into this story anyway), the movie is not the same and ultimately does not work well at all.This time the movie is set in 1946, in China and the Mummy is played by the awesome Jet Li.  In fact the only reason I give this even 2 stars is because of Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh.  They both did a great job with their characters, and the cinematography and visual effects are great,  However there is a total lack of continuity from the rest of the story.  First you are expected to believe that Brendan Fraser has aged 26 years from the first movie without looking much older.  The kid Alex from the second movie is now grown up and has lost the British accent in favor of an American one, and is very little like how he was portrayed in the second movie.  And John Hannah is given little, if nothing, to do in this movie, and it just seems like his character is there to tag along.  I think the decision to recast the character of Evie was horrible, and they would have better off to had killed the character off than bring someone new in.  Even though I do not think Bello was horrible in the role, it just did not have the same feel as with how Weisz played her.As far as extras go on the disc version, there are few deleted and extended scenes and a 20 min making of feature.  As well as a commentary track on the film itself and a handful of other items.  Not as much as on the first two discs, but not bad for what is there.  As I said above it was really a movie that did not have to be made.  I think they had a much stronger franchise with the Mummy than they really did, and without without all of the original cast, which they did get for The Mummy Returns, it just fell very flat.

'The Mummy Returns' was pretty bad, almost causing me to not even give this third outing a look. Since it came on cable I decided to give it a shot.The film starts out promising with a cool set up in China, but soon after the opening credits role it goes downhill. The makers of these films try forcing so many comedic elements into them; it takes all tension away and actually slows the pace of the film down. This film could have been pretty good, if it was played a little more serious. In fact if they deleted the entire ridiculous comedy and uninspired romances scenes out, it would play much better. It's very frustrating to see a good idea gone so terribly wrong.To make matters worse the CGI is unconvincing most of the time and having Yeti make goal post GOOD signs with their arms is nothing short of ludicrous! This film and all of the films in the series should have been played straight. It's a shame that some films makers don't seem to have a clue that stupid jokes are never welcomed or any ""cojones"" for that matter to make a film that isn't going to appeal to an age group too young to see this film any way!

As if The Mummy Returns wasn't bad enough, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor makes for a mind-numbingly dull and endlessly un-entertaining flick that squashes what little promise there was brewing up during the making of the flick.  Stephen Sommers, who wrote and directed the first two films, couldn't be bothered here since he was busy with G.I. Joe, so Rob Cohen (XXX, The Fast & The Furious, Stealth) gets the director's chair while Smallville creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar share script duties, and the film couldn't be any worse for it.  An ancient Chinese emperor (Jet Li) gets unearthed, resurrected, and naturally begins some otherworldly chaos.  It's up to adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser), his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello, replacing Rachel Weisz who wisely turned down reprising her role), and their son Alex (Luke Ford) to put a stop to him.  The first thing you'll notice about this third Mummy film is that the acting is atrocious.  Fraser is as good as he usually is, but overall he just seems tired here.  Bello, who is usually good in everything else that she's in, is uncommonly bad with an even worse accent, while any action scenes that occur with Li are flat and disappointing.  John Hannah also returns as Evelyn's bumbling brother Jonathan, but he is wasted here, as are Michelle Yeoh and Russell Wong.  The CGI is decent at best, although there is plenty of overload to be found, to the point where scenes become incomprehensible.

1202155,A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,B001HQZJMU,Newton Ooi,"[2, 2]","Movie franchises, unlike most other human creations, often get worse with each subsequent incarnation.  This is quite aptly illustrated with Brendan Fraser's Mummy franchise.  The first Mummy came out in the spring of 1999, and was a commercial hit and probably the 2nd best movie of that year after the Matrix.  The 2nd Mummy came out several years later, and though interesting, had some ludicrious scenes in it.  This most recent Mummy just sucked.  If there was ever a perfect example of a movie in which the dialogue was used solely to join adjacent action scenes together, and provide an occasional slinger, this is it.  Unfortunately, even the action scenes were lackluster.Worst of all, this movie lacked attention to detail in numerous scenes.  I will expand on this last point.  At the beginning of the movie, a narrator describes how the Dragon Emperor was turned to stone, and we see him frozen into a stance of pain and agony standing on the ground.  Outside his palace, his army is frozen into stone while in battle formation.  About 15 minutes later in the movie, this army is discovered in AD 1946, in a totally different formation, and the stone emperor is standing on a chariot holding the reins!  How do stone warriors change their stance?  Another screwed up scene was the episode in the Himalayas.  By the constant blizzard, I would guess the temperature of this setting is around 0 degrees F.  Several dozen characters are shown in this scene; many of them participating in dialogue, yet we cannot see any condensation from their breaths!  And probably the worst scene of all is the final fight scene between Fraser's character, Rick, and Jet Li's chracter, the Dragon Emperor.  Here we have numerous punches to the face on both sides, yet they each have perfect hair throughout the whole scene!  Absolutely ridiculous!Even after leaving out these detail flaws, the acting is also horrible.  The romance scenes were totally contrived and rushed.  The mother - daughter scenes seemed fake, and Jet Li's portrayal as the Dragon Emperor was totally off.  His character seemed more like a general, or a magician, than that of an emperor.  There was no hint of nobility, regality, or supremacy in his role; only violence.  Probably the worst portrayal was that of Alex O'Connell.

1202163,A25XGZX0YRTJKN,B001HQZJMU,Paul J. Moade,"[4, 4]","I'd have to agree with most of the other reviews on the quality of this movie.I looked forward to seeing the third installment of ""The Mummy"" with anticipation, but was disappointed to the extent of taking a one day hiatus halfway through the film - it was that bad. The first two installments captivated me with a sense of adventure and were entertaining. This one just plain falls flat. While the introduction to the film was good enough, the rest lacked much of any kind of story which leaves the audience wondering what is happening and why.First thing you'll notice is that Evie O'Connell is played by a different actress. The magic between Brendan Frazer and Rachel Weisz is missing to the point that (even though you know Maria Bello is supposed to be Evie) one asks, ""Who is this woman""?Alex O'Connell is now a young adult and an adventurer in his own right. But where the second Mummy film showed us a tight knit family who would do anything for each other, Alex is now a rebel, Rick is a father who nags his son. Remember the lines from Mummy 2?Rick: ""It isn't easy being a dad!""Alex: ""No, but you do it real good.""What happened to that relationship and support? This movie portrays a family who doesn't really seem to care a lot for each other and is in severe need of reconciliation. Really bad scripting. Drags the film into the ""B"" category for this tired old saw.There is action here .... a LOT of action. But it doesn't hang together like the earlier releases. It just seems as if the writers looked for every reason to have lots of things going on to make up for a dramatic lack of story line.Even Brendan Frazer seems tired with the role. His earlier spark as the pluck adventurer is gone and it seems as if he's saying mentally, ""here we go again. Kill the bad guy, save the world.""The CGI and effects in the movie are nice and you won't be disappointed here. However, it takes more than just a bunch of special effects to make a good story.Sorry guys; for as much as I liked the first two Mummy films and enjoyed Brendan Frazer in them, I have to give this movie a `thumbs down'. They should change the title to: ""Mummy 3: An Atrocious Continuance"". Two stars ... and I'm being generous.

The fact is that franchises tend to get weaker over time (with few exception), and the Mummy is no different. The fact is that this film had so much freakin potential, and the filmmakers just let the opportunity fall through to a mediocre summer fun film.The movie has a good number of breakdowns, one of which is the acting. Brendon Fraser brings a weakened performance to the table this time around. Whatever used to be there for him just wasn't there now. The new Mrs. O'Connel, Maria Bello, just wasn't doing it for me. I think she's a good actress, but I don't think she was right for the part. She made the character much more tame and motherly then Rachel Wiesz had portrayed her. Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh do an OK job, but they had only but so much to work with. Both characters seemed very hallow, especially Li's character as the Dragon Emperor. After he was sealed away, it seemed like there was no real reason for him to be alive. He himself even asks ""why did you raise me?"" The sad thing is that the Dragon Emperor had such potential to be an awesome villain, even worse them Imhotep. I mean the guy could control most of the elements, and he did it pretty well (though they could have got more creative with that as well). It just wasn't all that great.The other let down was the action. Like i said, mediocre at best. It was an ok action flick, but i was so very disappointed in the battle at the end, especially with Yoeh and Li's very brief duel. It was so badly choreographed and ultimately pointless, a true waste of two martial artist actors. The only time when the action looked good is when CGI was involved; i.e. when the Emperor's army fights the dead soldiers from under the wall.Bottom line, don't go into this thinking its another Mummy Returns. Imhotep is dead for good (they make sure to say so in the film) and the Dragon Emperor is here for the moment.

It was not going to morph from a bad martial arts film to a real Mummy movie and no one was going to end up in Egypt with the REAL mummy, that cute bald guy with the killer eyes.I ended up fast forwarding to the end to see if there was any merit here. There wasn't. The actress who played Evie was absolutely horrible - without that sense of continuity and chemistry between Brendan Frasier and the adorable and much-missed Rachel Weisz (if she really did turn it down because of the script I love her even more) there was nothing to hook you - and I wasn't buying that new guy as their son either.So if you were expecting a real sequel to the Mummy movies, I am sorry to tell you this one isn't it.

You do have one returning actor from the previous mummy movies other than Brendan Frasier and that's John Hannah and while he brings some humorous entertainment to the movie it becomes stale pretty soon.  Then we have Maria Bello who's the wife Evelyn in the movie and while she is a pretty decent actress I'm sorry to say it just seemed wrong to have her in that role and not Rachel.  The special effects weren't bad but again with the storyline it just wasn't as much of whats happening but more on seeing the same thing technically for a third time with no true change of story plots from the previous two films.

1202178,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B001HQZJMU,Robin Simmons,"[3, 8]","First of all, let it be said that everything about this Blu-ray version of ""MUMMY: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""is technically superb -- the visual quality of the movie, the rich sound and the significant extras.For home theater aficionados, watching this film on a full hi-def plasma or LCD, it actually looks better than it did in the theater.But what about the movie itself?  The movie did OK at the box office ($100 M domestic and nearly $400M international), but there are many who have not seen it because the reviews (including many posted here) were weak.  So let's reconsider the movie itself.Many of the theatrical reviewers missed the point of this whopping, exotic adventure and a portion of the potential audience stayed away from this ultimate popcorn flick.  Now the hi-def disc offers another chance to experience and yes, enjoy, this fine escapist entertainment that's also state-of-the-art filmmaking.The Blu-ray version delivers an extraordinary-looking transfer of this exotic action adventure that lives up to the whopping premise of the title, which is: when a curse is broken, the 2,200 year old Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) is revived along with his horde of 10,000 warriors, no longer terra cotta tombmates!  And Rick O'Connell must stop them from enslaving the world.This latest incarnation of the reborn mummy franchise is in every way an homage to the very best of the 1930s and 40s Saturday serials, and it is done on a huge scale that perfectly fits its story.  Yes it's over-the-top.  But that's the whole point.  It always respects the audience (unlike the ""Matrix""or the ""Pirates of the Caribbean""sequels), and it is far superior to the dreadful ""Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull"" misadventure.This is NOT a movie about plot so much as it is about the ride. And what a globe trotting ride it is.  How can you not love a movie that has fanaticized Chinese soldiers, an army of undead royal bodyguards, risen mummified bodies of unnumbered of oppressed (buried under the Great Wall) as well as fierce Yetis.  Yes, abominable snowmen.  And they are good guys!Brendan Fraser is just right as Rick ""Mummy Hunter"" O'Connell who races from the catacombs of ancient China to a frigid redoubt in the high Himalayas.  Maria Bello is terrific as his Rick's wife Evelyn (Rachel Weisz opted to not return to the series).  Bello obviously loves this kind of rough and tumble action character,.  Michelle Yeoh is a cool charismatic screen presence as a double-crossing sorceress.Rob Cohen is a genius with this material.  His visual commentary (you can watch the movie with him) is revealing and free-form.  He talks about the making of the movie of course as well as everything from President Elect Obama to his own practice of Buddhism.If you're looking for serious, intimate epics in the vein of David Lean, forget it.  But if you want to feel like a 12 year old in the best way, don't miss this adventure that never lets up.  The scope and detail of the production design is superb.  And for the most part accurate for the period portrayed.The extras are generous.  I loved the ""making of"" featurette and the Blu-ray option that enables the viewer to collect favorite scenes and share in the on-line community.Give this extravagant and fun flick another chance.  Highly recommended for what it is.

Anyway!It is my own opinion that ""The Mummy:  Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" isn't a bad movie, but it suffers largely from the fact that the film's pace is so rushed.  There is so much going on in the story that 112 minutes is not nearly enough time to tell all of it properly.The movie takes us from Singapore (where we barely take notice of Jonathan as the owner of a lush casino named after Imhotep) to the Himalayas to Shangri-La (very easy travel for our ragtag band of heroes) with one chase or gunfight scene after another, with such little attention paid towards the relationships between the O'Connells (maybe there would've been better chemistry between Bello and Fraser had there been more mushy Rick-and-Evie moments) or Alex with his parents or his uncle Jonathan.I enjoyed the characters played by Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, though their screen time was shockingly limited and their interactions together was over much too quickly.  It seems like much more could've been done to flesh out their characters, and what could've been a great fight scene between them was cut too short.  The immortality of Yeoh and her daughter was given up almost immediately following Yeoh's appearance at Shangri-La, and did nobody notice that Yeoh's lover, and father of her daughter, was the leader of the soldiers that rose from below the Great Wall to battle the Emperor's vast army?  It was very obvious that was who he was, yet there was no interaction between him and his daughter, or him with Yeoh...and with all the build-up of their great love in the beginning, you'd think there would be something.There was simply so much that was either glossed over or ignored completely, and it brought the movie down.  The actors did the best they could with the script, but despite their efforts this does not measure up to the first two Mummy movies.  It is worth checking out and deciding for yourself, but I would only buy this to complete your Mummy collection.",3,We already know why most people hate this movie...*spoilers ahead*,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",2009,2615,"['presence', 'Rachel', 'Weisz', 'sorely', 'missed', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'definitely', 'not', 'Rachel', 'believe', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'horrible', 'material', 'was', 'written', 'Evie', 'character', 'yes', 'Luke', 'Ford', 'Alex', ""O'Connell"", 'very', 'different', 'British-accented', 'whippersnapper', 'fromThe', 'Mummy', 'Returns', 'Two-Disc', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'actually', 'kinda', 'liked', 'Ford', 'Alex', 'do', 'agree', 'bit', 'old', 'be', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'son', 'more', 'younger', 'brother', 'more', 'credit', 'Fraser', 'just', 'as', 'hot', 'did', 'whenThe', 'Mummy', 'Two-Disc', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'was', 'released', 'almost', 'ten', 'years', 'earlier', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'man', 'Yum', 'Anyway', 'own', 'opinion', 'Mummy', 'Tomb', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'largely', 'fact', 'film', 'pace', 'so', 'rushed', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'story', '112', 'minutes', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'time', 'tell', 'properly.The', 'movie', 'Singapore', 'where', 'barely', 'take', 'notice', 'Jonathan', 'owner', 'lush', 'casino', 'named', 'Imhotep', 'Himalayas', 'Shangri-La', 'very', 'easy', 'travel', 'ragtag', 'band', 'heroes', 'one', 'chase', 'gunfight', 'scene', 'such', 'little', 'attention', 'paid', 'relationships', ""O'Connells"", 'maybe', 'there', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'chemistry', 'Bello', 'Fraser', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'mushy', 'Rick-and-Evie', 'moments', 'Alex', 'parents', 'uncle', 'Jonathan.I', 'enjoyed', 'characters', 'played', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'screen', 'time', 'was', 'shockingly', 'limited', 'interactions', 'together', 'was', 'over', 'much', 'too', 'quickly', 'much', 'more', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'flesh', 'out', 'characters', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'great', 'fight', 'scene', 'was', 'cut', 'too', 'short', 'immortality', 'Yeoh', 'daughter', 'was', 'given', 'up', 'almost', 'immediately', 'following', 'Yeoh', 'appearance', 'Shangri-La', 'did', 'nobody', 'notice', 'Yeoh', 'lover', 'father', 'daughter', 'was', 'leader', 'soldiers', 'rose', 'Great', 'Wall', 'battle', 'Emperor', 'vast', 'army', 'was', 'very', 'obvious', 'was', 'who', 'was', 'yet', 'was', 'interaction', 'daughter', 'Yeoh', 'build-up', 'great', 'love', 'beginning', ""'d"", 'think', 'would', 'be', 'something.There', 'was', 'simply', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'glossed', 'ignored', 'completely', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'actors', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'script', 'efforts', 'not', 'measure', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'Mummy', 'movies', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'deciding', 'would', 'only', 'buy', 'complete', 'Mummy', 'collection']",N/A

The victor was the PS3 for seamless navigations and wait times.The picture looked adequate almost to a fault on some of the special effects sequences. There are plenty of chances to test your white balance and motion blur with black/dark backdrops. The sound was enjoyable with the DTS, but you must have your system set up just right for a film like this as the highs can drown out some of the dialogue mix/music mash (so a solo HDTV will not sound as good obviously).What makes this fun is the special features though. There are hours upon hours of extras to utilize, whether you watch them during the pic or by themselves. The two main docus are very informative on the production and are worth the watch. If anything, watch the Terra Cotta docu when Cohen gets a nice slam on Disney vs. real Chinese cultural history. The amount of ""I love working with (fill in the blank)"" gets sickening, especially with Fraser's high on something look in his interviews. The deleted scenes were thankfully removed from the film (11 minutes).

Someone in Hollywood believed Brendon Fraiser and Jet Li in the same film would miraculously make this a winner. That someone should lose his job.Synopsis: Ancient Chinese warlord is reawakened (along with 10,000 Terra Cotta warriors) to conquer the world. And there are Yetis....The first two movies in the series were fantastically entertaining. You had action, emotion, love, despair, and discoveries of a linked past that made the movies engrossing. They had excellent scripts, beautiful effects, and acting that made it look real. I watch them over and over. This dog...well, at least I watched until the end.Whoever cast this movie screwed the pooch. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell is, of course, excellent. I love the gung ho balls ahead character. He IS the character. In fact, he is the franchise.Rachael Weisz declined to return citing problems with the script. Boy did she make the right call. So Maria Bello is cast as Evy. Dear God In Heaven. what where they thinking! Where Weisz played Evuy with emotion, perfect timing, and a boatload of sex appeal, Bello is a block of freaking wood who phones in her part. She has NO fluidity, no sense of timing, and not a trace of sex appeal. In fact, a block of wood could have done a much better job.In the 2nd film, The Mummy Returns, the son, Alex, has a very strong `proper' English accent and typical `Brit' attitude. In this movie, Alex (Luke Ford) has NO trace of accent or his English upbringing. He plays the role like a young John Wayne, as if he was raised in Arizona. It totally fails.Jet Li as Emperor Han...well, I loved him in Lethal Weapon 4, Unleashed, and The One. He should have done the role of Emperor Han with the same soft-sneering attitude he had in LW4. But he wasn't directed that way in this film. He was concrete, and wooden. There was no sense of surprise upon awakening 2000 years later. No marveling at the changes in the world. No wonder at how the world had changed. Totally unrealistic.Redeeming factors: Michelle Yeoh (very big star in China) as Zi Yaun, the witch who betrays Han knowing his merciless character, Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, and Russell Wong as General Ming Guo (Han's right hand man who falls in love with Zi Yaun). John Hannah plays Evy's gold-digging brother seamlessly from the prior films.And there are the Yetis. Ya gotta love the Computer Graphics.

Whereas on the whole, people loved the first two films, there's been an almost inexplicable backlash against this third entry in the series.  And I never understood it.  I saw it with my whole family in theaters before reading any critical or fan reviews and we all enjoyed it.  I watched it with several friends, including one who absolutely hated the second movie, and they all enjoyed it.  In fact, everyone I know outside of the internet...  Well, they all enjoyed it.  Even the hard-to-please people.  It's an enjoyable adventure-romp with a cheesy story, some cool special effects, and some very decent action sequences.  It's the same darned type of film as the first two, so it makes no sense to me why it's supposedly so much worse than the prior films.The story is simple- Rick and Evy go to meet their son, whom has unearthed the petrified Dragon Emperor in China.  When a paramilitary group orchestrates his revival, Rick, Evy, Alex, Jonathan and their new sidekick Lin must follow and stop him from regaining his power raising his army to enslave all of mankind.It's big, loud, stupid and a lot of fun.

I wish Stephen Sommers had directed.  But fundamentally, this isn't any worse than the other movies.  I'd even argue that it's superior to the second film, because that one was all over the place with the story and had far more visual effects just for the sake of visual effects, whereas this one is more direct and concise in terms of plot, and has far less visual effects.The DVD/Blu-Ray also has a nice assortment of special features, with commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and some deleted scenes.

1202207,ACLBGLKNDOP3G,B001HQZJMU,"Tim Byrd ""author of Doc Wilde & The Frogs of ...","[6, 6]","The first two Mummy flicks were both obvious labors of love by Stephen Sommers, their writer/director. They were amazing showcases for CGI effects, but beyond that they had engaging stories full of pulp action, lots of comedy that did not descend into camp, and wonderful characters performed by perfectly cast actors. Brendan Fraser, as American soldier-of-fortune Rick O'Connell, was a perfect pulp hero, brash and cocky and capable. Rachel Weisz as Evelyn ""Evy"" O'Connell (n&eacute; Carnahan) was the brilliant and (extraordinarily) sexy librarian who could hold her own in a scrap. Together they had incredible chemistry, crack comic timing, and the charm and natural repartee of a classic  Hollywood couple (like Gable and Lombard, or Powell and Loy).Throw in John Hannah as Evy's sleazy but lovable brother, Arnold Vosloo as great villain Imhotep (whose ultimate fate, at the end of the second film, possesses pathos and tragedy), and a host of great supporting roles, and you have some flicks with great characters on the screen at all times. Even the kid who plays the O'Connell's son, Alex, in the second film is brash and bratty without being annoying, a rare thing in a character like his.The O'Connell's adventures continued in a short-lived cartoon that was fairly good, and I remember it fondly as one of the few sources of pulp goodness I could share with my then five-year-old son.He and I watched The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor last night. When I say it's incredible, well, you'd darn well better believe that I am lying. Flat out full of it. On a George W. Bush scale. Because it's terrible.Here's what's good about it:* The idea to do a third Mummy film.* The idea to use China as the setting, to do something different with the mummy idea this time around.* The idea to cast Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh (always a great idea to cast either, an exceptional idea to have `em both).* Some cool creatures, like a really nicely done dragon, but especially the yeti. Because the yeti are the one point of absolute true awesome in the whole flick.* The final battle is okay.You may notice that three of the things that are good about the movie start with ""The idea to..."" But those things ended without bringing the ideas to enjoyable fruition. The way it turned out, it was actually a bad idea to do a third Mummy film, the idea to use China was fine but the resulting story wasn't that interesting (though a good script doctor could have done great things with it), and they got Li and Yeoh in the film, and gave them both very little to do that was at all interesting.This movie isn't a labor of love for Stephen Sommers, who this time just produced. It possesses none of the warmth or wit or charm of the previous films. The action is dull. The characters are uninteresting, and the main characters are written inconsistently with their earlier portrayals.This is a bad movie. But beyond that, it's a bad movie with a worst thing about it. No, it's a bad movie with a Worst Thing About It. And that worst thing is Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz (who read the script and smartly refused to do it) as Evy.This Worst Thing About It is two sided. First, it's bad because we lose Weisz, who was always magnetic and funny and smart and strong and just smoking hot as this character, and who had wondrous chemistry with Brendan Fraser.Second, it's bad because we wind up with Bello, who is a very talented actress, but plays Evy with all the spunk and sexiness of a wad of mashed potatoes, and who has absolutely no chemistry with Fraser.I can't overstate how badly this miscasting damages the film. The relationship between Rick and Evy is the heart of these movies, and had Weisz returned, this film would be at least twice as watchable just because of the dynamic between her and Fraser. Bello's performance is a sinkhole that draws the attention and drains away even what little vim there is in this movie. Even my son, who normally wouldn't be caught dead saying he cared about which actress plays a girl character, started kvetching almost immediately, and early in the film started cheering on the villains whenever they had Evy in deadly peril. He genuinely liked Rachel Weisz, and her replacement by Bello was so awful it was like a personal offense to him (and to me, and likely to a vast majority of fans of the previous films).This film pretty much murders the franchise.

Storywise, the film synopsis says it best.Brendan Fraser returns as explorer Rick O'Connell in an epic adventure that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Along with his son Alex (Luke Ford), wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) and her brother Jonathan (John Hannah), he must stop a mummy awakened from a 2,000-year-old curse from enslaving the world.  Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress (Michelle Yeoh) to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) and his 10,000 warriors have lain forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. When dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, he turns to the only people he can think of with the skill and knowledge to combat the undead: his parents. But the Emperor's quest for world domination has only intensified during his imprisonment and, with unimaginable supernatural powers and a legion of Terra Cotta Warriors at his command, the Emperor Mummy could be an unstoppable force--unless the O'Connells can vanquish him first.This film, just like the previous three, is pure escapism. While the first film drew on the Mummy (Bram Stoker), this entry is more original but more monumental in its' scope.  The special effects are good, and there is Fraser, charming as always yet he manages to escape and pull off the near impossible.Don't watch it for history, watch it for fun.If you manage to have the blu-ray version, the special features rock!Tim LasiutaLong Live the Mummy!",4,Is Third time the charm???,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",2008,1756,"['Tomb', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'spectacular', 'out', 'action', 'film', 'viewers', 'heart', 'China', 'witness', 'battle', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'Jet', 'Li', 'Rick', ""O'Connell"", 'Fraser', 'Storywise', 'film', 'synopsis', 'Fraser', 'returns', 'explorer', 'Rick', ""O'Connell"", 'epic', 'adventure', 'catacombs', 'ancient', 'China', 'high', 'frigid', 'Himalayas', 'son', 'Alex', 'Luke', 'Ford', 'wife', 'Evelyn', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'brother', 'Jonathan', 'John', 'Hannah', 'must', 'stop', 'mummy', 'awakened', '2,000-year-old', 'curse', 'enslaving', 'world', 'Doomed', 'double-crossing', 'sorceress', 'Michelle', 'Yeoh', 'spend', 'eternity', 'suspended', 'animation', 'China', 'ruthless', 'Dragon', 'Emperor', 'Jet', 'Li', '10,000', 'warriors', 'have', 'lain', 'forgotten', 'eons', 'entombed', 'clay', 'vast', 'silent', 'terra', 'cotta', 'army', 'When', 'dashing', 'adventurer', 'Alex', ""O'Connell"", 'tricked', 'awakening', 'ruler', 'eternal', 'slumber', 'only', 'people', 'can', 'think', 'skill', 'knowledge', 'combat', 'undead', 'parents', 'Emperor', 'quest', 'world', 'domination', 'only', 'intensified', 'imprisonment', 'unimaginable', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'legion', 'Terra', 'Cotta', 'Warriors', 'command', 'Emperor', 'Mummy', 'could', 'be', 'unstoppable', 'force', ""O'Connells"", 'can', 'vanquish', 'first.This', 'film', 'just', 'previous', 'three', 'pure', 'escapism', 'first', 'film', 'drew', 'Mummy', 'Bram', 'Stoker', 'entry', 'more', 'original', 'more', 'monumental', 'scope', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'Fraser', 'charming', 'always', 'yet', 'escape', 'pull', 'off', 'near', 'impossible.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'history', 'watch', 'fun.If', 'manage', 'have', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'rock', 'Tim', 'LasiutaLong', 'Live', 'Mummy']",N/A

After the quirky fun and adventure of the 1st movie has the 3rd really been reduced to this?  Replacing Rachel Weisz with Maria whatever her name is was the first big blunder.  Her and Brenden Frasier just did NOT have the chemistry and she was so stiff!  And what about Alex?  What happened to the charming BRITISH kid?  This guy is so Americanized that he makes the normal American voice seem cultured.  Give me a break!  He's a stiff, stilted actor as well.It's the same old plot but watered down.  Big discovery, wake mummy up, he wants to rule the world, he raises an army, Rick saves the day, the end.  I can't believe the only cast originals are Rick and Jonathan.  I hoped to see a return of some of our Egyptian friends, that they would be needed to bring the latest bad guy down.  What a bummer!This movie is so full of corny one-liners too.  One of the worst is when Jonathan is on fire and yelling at Rick: ""Spank my..."" well, you get the idea.  The point is, they were trying WAY too hard here!

I also like the terra cotta warriors.But I wanted to see more of Shangri-la, or to see the witch see her lover for one moment.  Hey, if he was pulled to pieces, why was his mummy pretty much intact?  And why, oh why, does Brenden Frasier still look so HOT when he should be in his 50's?  The timeline is really messed up as the first mummy movie was in the 20's and this is now the mid-40's.  He should have aged, as Evie and Jonathan should have.The whole thing was rushed too, and it all came together too conveniently.  They really didn't face any setbacks, and any attempted drama was too easily solved.  I'd prefer to think the story left off at the 2nd movie, which was certainly pushing it.

1202221,ATCBQUONOZCE4,B001HQZJMU,"W. M. Bell ""Maegan Bell""","[1, 1]","For whatever reasons, I truly enjoy the first two movies of this series, so much so that I still watch them rather frequently. They are always the go-to movies if I just feel like watching something to entertain me but nothing around me is tickling my fancy. Fraser and Weisz have amazing chemistry, the plot is exciting, and the side characters are hilarious...not to mention the hot as hell-fire desert man from Deuce Bigelow fame.So then there was news of the 3rd installment. At this point I was working toward my college degree, but I was just as thrilled as the first time I heard about it. Rejoicing all over the place. Then my little bubble got burst. Rachel Weisz would not be cast as Edie in this movie.She was offered the role, for sure, but turned it down because of a bad script. I was really upset with this woman at first and then I saw the mistake, I mean movie, which she wisely chose not to touch with a 10 foot pole. What a piece of garbage. Not only did the plot seem completely contrived, it had hardly any continuity from the previous movies. How did Alex go from being a child around 10 to a person who looks to be 30 in the couple of years between these movies? Where did his British accent go and how did it turn into an American one while he was digging around in China? Who is the psychopath that thought replacing Weisz with Maria Bello would be in any way okay? What happened to Edie being Egyptian? For goodness sake, it seems like they didn't even try to pick someone who could hold up that part with any integrity. It just seems like they picked the first available actress who would do it for the cheapest (Maria Bello's career isn't exactly stellar so I'm sure it didn't take much at all to get her on board). Weisz was fiesty and captivating, where Bello is vanilla and honestly just seems lost in the movie. Its like Rob Cohen just wanted to crank out another film as quickly and cheaply as possible, regardless of what effect it would have on the integrity of the product he is pushing. I honestly think that if Fraser's career wasn't in such a slump he would have turned down the role as well (which I would have LOVED so we could just pick up from the 2nd movie when a director with an actual sense of what is good could take on the franchise). But no... now we are stuck trying to work around that disaster of a movie.What is really sad is that they already have plans for the Mummy 4: Rise of the Aztecs, with 5 and 6 waiting in the wings. Maria Bello (having nothing better to do) has already signed on for all of them. Its a tragedy. Now we all get to sit by and watch Rob Cohen run this franchise into the ground, taking whats left of poor Fraser's career with it. This franchise could have been really great. It would have been the Indiana Jones of my generation...now it will never live up to the potential it once had. Fraser is the only thing left breathing life into these movies, and he is the one who is going to shoulder the blame for the rest of them bombing because he pretty much IS the franchise....its terrible.The only way it could be saved is this:Someone, for God's sake, take the reigns from Rob Cohen's hands. Basically pretend like the 3rd movie didn't happen, bring back Weisz, find someone (much younger and better at acting!) who could actually be Rick and Edie's son, and for the love of all things holy stop making Alex the focus of the movie. Rick is the best character, there haven't even been enough movies to start ""passing the torch"" to his kid yet, geez. I mean c'mon Rob Cohen, couldn't you have tried just a little bit? This movie franchise is going to crumble in your fingers, Rob, because you decided it was better to lose one of the MAIN TWO CHARACTERS who CARRIED the movies because you were too cheap and lazy to find better writers, and wanted to make a quicker buck than have a high quality movie which could endure for years to come.I won't be back to watch any more Mummy movies....after that third one I doubt I'll even bother renting them. I'm happy without wasting a whole two hours of my life. I'll just have to keep watching the first two and hoping that some day, years down the line, some director will realize how much of a mistake this was and re-do the series.

1202222,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001HQZJMU,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[0, 2]","Several years have passed since ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) have made some decent box-office outings. The second sequel (arguably the unneeded sequel)to the action-fantasy franchise has a different director at the helm, in the name of Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious). If the first two films were any indication, Stephen Sommers is indeed a good action director; he knows how to make the wide camera angle, doesn't rely on slow motion and knows how to make his actors look quite cool. Rob Cohen also has a good resume, but you can tell that Sommers' absence was felt, but the film does have that Sommers` pace. (Sommers is present as producer)Thousands of years ago, an evil emperor who has mastered the mystic arts had the malevolent intentions to take over the entire world. Betrayed by his general (Russell Wong), and cursed by the beauteous witch, Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh), the evil emperor was buried under the sands of time. Now awakened by an ambitious military leader (Anthony Wong), it is up to Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn O'Connell (Maria Bello), together with their all-grown up son Alex (Luke Ford) and the mysterious Lin (Hong Kong's own Isabella Leong) to try to stop the second rise of the evil emperor and his army. Here we go again....The film's plot is very simple and feels like a rehash of the first two installments. The script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar is mainly built around the action and is full of familiar plot elements that it offers no surprises. While it's not exactly a lost cause, since there are some new additions to the screenplay that helped it out--(the Tibetan CGI kindly Abominable Snowmen, subtle doses of humor, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh) the film does lack a good dose of emotions. The father and son relationship offers nothing we haven't seen before, the bored ""retired"" adventurers gimmick, and the awakening of the two armies of the dead to oppose each other has been done numerous times.The performances by the cast is good for the most part. Brendan Fraser is in familiar territory and Maria Bello (who takes over the sorely missed Rachel Weisz's role) does a convincing English woman. The two do have chemistry but they have so little to work with and they look too young and unconvincing to have a grown-up son. Speaking of chemistry, there are no sparks between Luke Ford and beauteous Isabella Leong, their time together onscreen falls flat. Leong is a capable actress (as proven in her Asian films) but her character is so severely underdeveloped along with Michelle Yeoh`s. Which is such a pity since Lin and Zi Yuan are the most interesting characters in the film. This would be difficult to do, since they may steal the spotlight from Rick and Evy, but the film would have stayed aloft if their characters took on more than supporting roles. Jet Li had limited screen time but he does still have that charisma that catches your eye, Li can act and fit's the role of the emperor. However, to hamper the actors further, the dialogue of the film is VERY clich&eacute;d that it proved a little empty. I did say that there were subtle bits of humor that helped a little but I didn't say they were original.Thankfully, the action sequences were entertaining to watch. The film has some nicely placed scenes of action, the shots are ""spiffy"" and the CGI effects, while not the best we've seen are quite good. Although the use of effects are somewhat clich&eacute;d also. Water and ice effects, wind and fire, there's even a nice looking three headed dragon and the snowmen, armies of the dead--all good but not groundbreaking. The fights were good but not great, this is the part that you feel that it was fluid enough but it could have been better. I missed Stephen Sommers even though Rob Cohen did an acceptable job I think.In closing, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is fun enough on the entertainment factor but it just feels a little flat. The action sequences were good but without the proper set up and emotions, the action felt like it was a simple excuse to delay the film's outcome. The film is so predictable that it throws its punches too soon and it overlooked several details that the story itself was also underdeveloped and full of holes. The film isn't as good or as entertaining as the first two films, but thankfully, it wasn't much, much worst.Rent it first! [2  +Stars]Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen.
