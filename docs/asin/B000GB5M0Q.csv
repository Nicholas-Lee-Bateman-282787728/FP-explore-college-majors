It was a bit too easy for the first half, so I stuck to my collection of Prevention DVD's ...which are AMAZING! I have a few complaints about Fit and Firm Pregnancy. First, the dance moves in the aerobics segment are lame. I did not not really feel like doing the cha cha with my big belly! Denise claims that the video will help maintain your body during pregnancy, but my arms got flabby towards my last weeks. I will admit that I did not gain weight in my thighs or hips, so that was a plus. Denise's voice is annoying, and because i was irritable through my pregnancy it bugged me. There is part where Denise gleefully says ""you will get back into your jeans in no time"". I found this to be deceitful and harmful. Ladies, the truth is that it will take awhile for most of us to get back into our jeans! Unless you are graced with amazing genes, you will have to wear a size or two larger for awhile. And that is OK! I understand that we feel pressure from the media. Look at Nicole Ritchie. A month after giving birth she looked like a skeleton again. J.Lo had twins and was back to her old figure shortly. It seems as if Hollywood starlets are going on weight loss plans with in weeks of having babies, and that is not healthy. It is highly recommended that you wait at least 6 weeks to start up an exercise program. I just went to the doctors and my physician informed me that our bodies take up to a year to recover after the baby is born. We shouldn't go on crazy diets or weight loss plans. Take care of yourself. Eat a healthy balanced diet. A good plan to follow is Weight Watchers. Give yourself a year and a half to get back down to your original jean size. And if you don't get there, who cares...just be proud of yourself for being healthy! One more thing, I do love the pilates portion of this DVD. You should out Denise's Pilates For Every Body book. Its great for postpartum work outs. Plus, she has a good diet plan in there and helpful inspirational quotes.

I really enjoyed it!  It is a good, fun workout and its seems safe and moderate.  I enjoy the fact that there are other women who are in various levels of their pregnancy, so there are modifications to it.  I look forward to doing the 20 minute cardio section throughout my whole pregnancy and look forward to using both the trimester additional workouts.",5,I am enjoying this workout!,1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,496,"['have', 'one', 'other', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'video', 'annoy', 'other', 'video', 'was', 'great', 'workout', 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'good', 'fun', 'workout', 'safe', 'moderate', 'enjoy', 'fact', 'are', 'other', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'various', 'levels', 'pregnancy', 'are', 'modifications', 'look', 'forward', 'doing', '20', 'minute', 'cardio', 'section', 'whole', 'pregnancy', 'look', 'forward', 'using', 'trimester', 'additional', 'workouts']",N/A

I always have to watch it first, then go back and mute her annoying commentary while I do the workout.  The workout itself is pretty good, though... you can amp it up or tone it down as you see fit.  My doctor says anything that bounces your chest is too bouncy for your uterus, so I'm able to modify the routine to fit this rule and still feel like I've done something good for myself.",3,Good video for light exercise,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,478,"['exercises', 'are', 'good', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'insane', 'perkiness', 'very', 'long', 'always', 'have', 'watch', 'first', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'mute', 'annoying', 'commentary', 'do', 'workout', 'workout', 'pretty', 'good', 'can', 'amp', 'up', 'tone', 'down', 'see', 'fit', 'doctor', 'anything', 'chest', 'too', 'bouncy', 'uterus', ""'m"", 'able', 'modify', 'routine', 'fit', 'rule', 'still', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'done', 'something', 'good']",N/A
