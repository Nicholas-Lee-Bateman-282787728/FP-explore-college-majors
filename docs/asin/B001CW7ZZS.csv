Great acting.Blossoms in the Dust is another great classic with great story line and tells of the ups and downs in peoples lives and how they manage to live through it.  A good bio of the lady Greer Garson portrayed.It happened on 5th. Ave was a delightful comedy and shows the goodest of most folks hearts.  A great Christmas story.Holiday affair gave us a new and different character for Mitchum and he played it to the hilt.  Very cute story line.  A feel good movie.

The drama 'Holiday Affair' with Rober Mitchum and Janet Leigh being the most (though one feels sorry for the Wendell Corey character who loses his long-time love).  ""It Happened On 5th Avenue' is a light classic comedy set against the post-WWII era and ends with a Christmas scene which shows that 'family' should not just be limited to one's biological family... include any and all folks who might be alone that day!  ""All Mine to Give"" has to be the saddest and most bittersweet holiday movie ever made - It's a wonderful film, believe me, esp. if you are in a particularly 'blue Christmas' mood and feel the need to shed a few tears!  It is definitely NOT the movie to show with small kids present, who I think would be quite upset after viewing it, since it is about children who are made orphans right before Christmas.  My least favorite movie was ""Blossoms in the Dust""... it's not a bad movie, though not particularly great either, and strikes me as bit of filler material for this collection.",4,Interesting Classic Movies Set Against Holiday Season...,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",2010,1084,"['degree', 'movies', 'are', 'Christmas-y', 'are', 'very', 'mixed', 'beforewarned', 'drama', 'Affair', 'Rober', 'Mitchum', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'being', 'most', 'one', 'feels', 'sorry', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'character', 'who', 'long-time', 'love', 'Happened', '5th', 'Avenue', 'light', 'classic', 'comedy', 'set', 'post-WWII', 'era', 'Christmas', 'scene', ""'family"", 'should', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'limited', 'one', 'biological', 'family', 'include', 'folks', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'alone', 'day', 'Mine', 'Give', 'be', 'saddest', 'most', 'bittersweet', 'holiday', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'wonderful', 'film', 'believe', 'esp', 'are', 'particularly', ""'blue"", 'Christmas', 'mood', 'feel', 'need', 'shed', 'few', 'tears', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'movie', 'show', 'small', 'kids', 'present', 'who', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'quite', 'upset', 'viewing', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'made', 'orphans', 'right', 'Christmas', 'least', 'favorite', 'movie', 'was', 'Blossoms', 'Dust', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'particularly', 'great', 'strikes', 'bit', 'filler', 'material', 'collection']",Warner Brothers Classic Holiday Collection - Volume 2: (All Mine to Give / Holiday Affair / It Happened on 5th Avenue / Blossoms in the Dust)

The following is the press release.All Mine To Give (1957)A touching drama, All Mine To Give tells the sad story of six pioneer children who struggle to stay together on Christmas Day following the deaths of their parents. It stars Patty McCormack and Glynnis Johns along with Ellen Corby. This is perhaps one of the saddest movies I've ever seen, and I can remember the first time I saw it 40 years ago when I was 10.Holiday Affair (1949)This classic Christmas romantic comedy stars Janet Leigh as a poor young widow torn between a boring successful businessman and a romantic ne'er-do-well. Robert Mitchum and Wendell Corey co-star. I'm sure you can figure out which actor plays which man. This movie is very mature and realistic. Nobody is all bad or all good in this film.It Happened on 5th Avenue (1947)This screwball comedy is about a hobo and friends who move into a mansion while the owners are out of town for their Christmas holiday. The film was directed by Roy Del Ruth and stars Don DeFore and Ann Harding.Blossoms in the Dust (1941)Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon star in this true story of Edna Gladney, a woman who devoted her life to finding homes for unwanted infants. Felix Bressart co-stars. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy. This film is good, but doesn't tell anywhere close to the true story of Edna Gladney. She didn't need all of the family melodrama portrayed in the film to motivate her, and she was a real force in the care of children in Fort Worth,Tx. throughout her life.",5,The second of two holiday collections from WHV,1217030400,"07 26, 2008",2008,1599,"['four', 'films', 'collection', 'only', 'Blossoms', 'Dust', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'available', 'single', 'DVD', 'following', 'press', 'release.All', 'Mine', 'Give', '1957', 'touching', 'drama', 'Mine', 'Give', 'tells', 'sad', 'story', 'six', 'pioneer', 'children', 'who', 'struggle', 'stay', 'together', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'following', 'deaths', 'parents', 'Patty', 'McCormack', 'Glynnis', 'Johns', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'perhaps', 'one', 'saddest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'can', 'remember', 'first', 'time', 'saw', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'when', 'was', '10.Holiday', 'Affair', '1949', 'classic', 'Christmas', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'stars', 'Janet', 'Leigh', 'poor', 'young', 'widow', 'torn', 'boring', 'successful', 'businessman', 'romantic', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'Wendell', 'Corey', 'co-star', ""'m"", 'sure', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'actor', 'plays', 'man', 'movie', 'very', 'mature', 'realistic', 'Nobody', 'bad', 'good', 'film.It', 'Happened', '5th', 'Avenue', '1947', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'hobo', 'friends', 'who', 'move', 'mansion', 'owners', 'are', 'town', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Roy', 'Del', 'Ruth', 'stars', 'Don', 'DeFore', 'Ann', 'Harding.Blossoms', 'Dust', '1941', 'Greer', 'Garson', 'Walter', 'Pidgeon', 'star', 'true', 'story', 'Edna', 'Gladney', 'woman', 'who', 'devoted', 'life', 'finding', 'homes', 'unwanted', 'infants', 'Felix', 'Bressart', 'co-stars', 'Directed', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'film', 'good', ""n't"", 'tell', 'anywhere', 'close', 'true', 'story', 'Edna', 'Gladney', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'family', 'melodrama', 'portrayed', 'film', 'motivate', 'was', 'real', 'force', 'care', 'children', 'Fort', 'Worth', 'Tx', 'life']",Warner Brothers Classic Holiday Collection - Volume 2: (All Mine to Give / Holiday Affair / It Happened on 5th Avenue / Blossoms in the Dust)
