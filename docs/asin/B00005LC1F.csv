A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[3, 3]","Sometimes the guests at Fawlty Towers are more trouble than they're worth.Basil Fawlty finds that out the hard way in the second volume of ""Fawlty Towers,"" which is arguably the best comedy ever aired. And these classic episodes -- ""Gourmet Night,"" ""The Germans,"" and ""Communication"" -- are definitely some of the high points of this all-too-brief series.Basil (John Cleese) and Sybil (Prunella Scales) are planning a ""Gourmet Night"" with the creme-de-la-creme of Torquay society. Unfortunately, the new cook has a crush on Manuel (Andrew Sachs); when the waiter rejects him, he gets drunk and passes out. Now Basil frantically tries to salvage the gourmet night, with no chef, a dying car and a roomful of increasingly peevish guests.The ""Germans"" are coming! While Sybil recovers from surgery, Basil plans a fire drill, and arranges for a pair of German couples to stay at Fawlty Towers. But the fire drill goes horribly wrong, and Basil ends up hospitalized with a head injury. Undaunted, he heads back to his hotel to greet the Germans -- except he can't stop babbling about the war...""Communications"" break down when an autocratic lady arrives at Fawlty Towers -- she's practically deaf, and isn't satisfied with anything. As if that weren't infuriating enough, she soon loses some money and insists that the staff must have taken it. Meanwhile, Basil gets a racing tip from a customer, and decides to bet ten pounds on the horses...Anyone who's sick of the recycled sitcoms (""Hot Young Urbanites Fall In Love and Have Misadventures"") that pepper the TV landscape might want to try Fawlty Towers. The humour is still fresh after all these years, the writing is good, and the actors were great at physical comedy.The dialogue is especially sharp in these episodes, especially when a confused Manuel tries to talk to the oblivious deaf woman: ""No no, 'que' what."" ""K Watt?"" ""Si!"" ""C.K. Watt?"" ""Yes!"" And as witty as the hilarious scripting is, the ""Germans"" episode wouldn't be the same if it weren't for Basil's bizarre behavior and rubber-legged Hitler walk.Basil's social-climbing continues without much actual result. Partly it's because his bootlicking is so obvious, and partly because he's not very good at it (""How is your lovely daughter?"" ""She's dead""). And John Cleese seemed to be having lots of fun as the nastiest hotelier in the world. Sachs has some even funnier scenes as the hapless Spanish waiter Manuel, and Booth gets to be the ""normal"" one who tries to tone down the madness.Fawlty Towers reaches its peak in the second volume, with the Germans, deaf harpies and a roast duck.

Setting that aside, it is classified as a sitcom.  However, as most american sitcoms are written and filmed within a week or two, this series was written well over a year and each episode was painstakingly thought out.John Cleese has said over and over that the thing he is most proud of is the amount of story packed into each episode.  Each episode runs like 28 minutes or so and was popularized in the U.S. when shown on PBS in the late 70's and early 80's.  If you have never seen an episode and you really enjoy clever comedy, you'll enjoy this series.  Obviously, if you love Monty Python you'll love this as well.I can tell a lot about a person's sense of humor by what they think of this show.  If someone says &#34;I didn't like Fawlty Towers&#34;  that simply means they have no sense of humor.  If you don't like this, you simply don't understand witty humor.  There's even some slapstick stuff thrown in for those of you with a less sophisticated palate for comedy although it really isn't slapstick...some of you will understand that, some may not.If you liked Seinfeld, Community, Cheers, News Radio, Newhart and even the Dick Van Dyke Show you'll more than likely enjoy it as much as any of the aforementioned.  Personally, I agree that is is the best comedy series ever.  Keep in mind there are only somewhere around 13 episodes which explains why virtually every episode is considered a classic comedy episode.  There is a lot of subtle humor along with the more obvious stuff so sit back, pay attention, have some popcorn and enjoy a few giggles and shakes of the head while watching not a classic comedy series but THE classic comedy series of all time.Oh.

The plots centre around tense, rude and put-upon owner Basil Fawlty (Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), a comparatively normal chambermaid Polly (Booth), and hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs), showing their attempts to run the hotel amidst farcical situations and an array of demanding and eccentric guests.""[...]I watch these episodes over and over, never tiring of them.  The reasons I enjoy the show so much are two-fold.  First, the writing is very good.  The writers poke fun primarily at the English, making you laugh at their politeness, stoic nature and even racism.  It all plays out in a madcap comic style.(be forewarned, these were the days before political correctness).  If you have a soft spot in your heart for the British or even if you ever worked in a hotel or food service industries, I'm sure you'll get a laugh out of this series.Second, I think all the actors were cast perfectly and are each excellent in their roles.  Actors with seeminly small ""bit"" recurring roles are often hilarious for the few seconds they appear and deliver their lines.
