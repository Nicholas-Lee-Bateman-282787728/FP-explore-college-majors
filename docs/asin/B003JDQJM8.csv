1347400,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B003JDQJM8,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[4, 5]","When you think of the word mother, it resonates warmth, love, nuturing; and to some, it has a different connotation.  As mothers, we often talk about doing anything for our children, not knowing how far will we really go.  This is the theme here, a mother's love for her son, a mother must prove the capability of her son when taken advantage of, when the law is too distant to care.Generally, directors have in mind who they want to play a role, but in this case, Director Bong Joon-hoo knew the actress and was determined to make a move specially for her.  He was also inspired to do this movie from a TV episode that was based on a true story of how a mother, to the ultimate extreme, defended her elderly son.  You can learn about that in the wonderful DVD features, the making of the movie, and the insightful cinematography methods.  The musical score was limited, but in the features, you will learn the thought process by a musical director and how he builds a score on words from the movie.The story takes place in present time, in a village in South Korea, where a mentally challenged young man Do-Joon (Won Bin) has been accused of a murder of a young girl.  Mother and son share the same bed, on the floor, which indicates she never let him grow up for independence.  Mother is an acupuncturist without the proper licensing.  With mother's (Kim Hye-Ja) instinct in full gear, she is adamant her son is innocent.  After a failed attempt with a worthless lawyer, she sets out to prove his innocence.There is a lot happening in this film, over 2 hours, and the viewer is anxiously waiting to see how she will proceed with her investigation.  Just to see the actress' in her closeups is amazing; you can just read the fear, anger, anticipation, horror in her face.  Pay attention to some less effective scenes that harbor the clues.  Actor Won Bin doesn't quite have the usual appearance of someone mentally challenged, but he takes that role and makes it believable.  The changes and surprises lead one to pontificate, maybe he did, maybe he was framed, maybe he doesn't remember, etc.  You be the judge.....Rizzo",5,Love to the extreme,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,2122,"['When', 'think', 'word', 'mother', 'warmth', 'love', 'nuturing', 'different', 'connotation', 'mothers', 'often', 'talk', 'doing', 'anything', 'children', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'really', 'go', 'theme', 'here', 'mother', 'love', 'son', 'mother', 'must', 'prove', 'capability', 'son', 'when', 'taken', 'advantage', 'when', 'law', 'too', 'distant', 'care.Generally', 'directors', 'have', 'mind', 'who', 'want', 'play', 'role', 'case', 'Director', 'Bong', 'Joon-hoo', 'knew', 'actress', 'was', 'determined', 'make', 'move', 'specially', 'was', 'also', 'inspired', 'do', 'movie', 'TV', 'episode', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'how', 'mother', 'ultimate', 'extreme', 'defended', 'elderly', 'son', 'can', 'learn', 'wonderful', 'DVD', 'features', 'making', 'movie', 'insightful', 'cinematography', 'methods', 'musical', 'score', 'was', 'limited', 'features', 'will', 'learn', 'thought', 'process', 'musical', 'director', 'how', 'score', 'words', 'movie.The', 'story', 'place', 'present', 'time', 'village', 'South', 'Korea', 'where', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'young', 'man', 'Do-Joon', 'Won', 'Bin', 'been', 'accused', 'murder', 'young', 'girl', 'Mother', 'son', 'share', 'same', 'bed', 'floor', 'never', 'let', 'grow', 'up', 'independence', 'Mother', 'acupuncturist', 'proper', 'licensing', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Hye-Ja', 'instinct', 'full', 'gear', 'adamant', 'son', 'innocent', 'failed', 'attempt', 'worthless', 'lawyer', 'out', 'prove', 'innocence.There', 'lot', 'happening', 'film', '2', 'hours', 'viewer', 'anxiously', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'will', 'proceed', 'investigation', 'Just', 'see', 'actress', 'closeups', 'amazing', 'can', 'just', 'read', 'fear', 'anger', 'anticipation', 'horror', 'face', 'Pay', 'attention', 'less', 'effective', 'scenes', 'harbor', 'clues', 'Actor', 'Won', 'Bin', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'usual', 'appearance', 'someone', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'role', 'believable', 'changes', 'surprises', 'lead', 'one', 'pontificate', 'maybe', 'did', 'maybe', 'was', 'framed', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'remember', 'etc', 'be', 'judge', '..Rizzo']",Mother

1347402,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B003JDQJM8,Andrew Ellington,"[44, 48]","While it took a while for me to really get into this film, I must say that it is still lingering in the back of my mind.  This is a hard one to shake, and that is due in large part to a fascinating performance by Hye-ja Kim (think Imelda Staunton in `Vera Drake' without the happy-go-lucky overtones).The film circles around an elderly woman's search for the truth regarding a murder that places her mentally challenged son in prison.  Call it being at the wrong place at the wrong time (supposedly), but Yoon Do-joon finds himself behind bars when a young girl named Moon Ah-jung winds up dead and prostrated on a rooftop for the whole town to see.  Do-joon's mother is convinced of his innocence (he couldn't even hurt a water bug) but circumstantial evidence places him at the scene of the crime and thus leaves her with only one option; investigate herself.  Scrounging up the truth is a difficult task, and it may lead to answers she isn't ready to stomach, but it is something she needs to do, for herself and for her son.I'm a really big fan of the film noir and so the tones taken in this film, especially the second half, really appeal to me.  The darkness that encroaches on the films plot really flourish as the film progresses, and the conclusion is an emotional gut-punch of a very subtle kind, which I admire, appreciate and respect.I don't really want to give too much of the films eventualities away, even though the discussion of the mother's motives and actions is eminent.  Watching this film is a moral conundrum, and that is something that begs to be analyzed.  What I will say though, is that the final moment, on the bus, is probably the most poignant in the entirety of the film for it really nails the mother's moral coffin so-to-speak.  It reminds me a lot of how I felt at the end of `Oldboy', another Asian masterpiece.  The wrongs committed and the evils known by the main character are almost justified by the viewer because of our emotional connection to the character, but when broken down and separated from the `situation' we find them inexcusable.The mother's choice to `excuse' her actions is extremely provocative.Color me a huge fan of Hye-ja Kim's performance in this film.  It is a remarkable example of small yet powerful moments that culminate into very large yet realistically drawn explosions of emotional complexity.  Her few scattered outbursts are flawlessly rendered to carry far more emotional weight than the manufactured dramatized theatrics seen in many films today.  There is nothing mechanical or manipulative about this performance.  You don't doubt for a single moment that this woman is this man's mother.  You don't doubt for a second that she is determined to clear his name, no matter what the cost.  You see every ounce of her pain and misery.  It is etched all over her desperate face.  What is nice though, is that she doesn't shield us from the softer spots in this woman's heart.  Notice the smile she wears when speaking of the incident when her son was five.  While it is a dark and disturbing incident, you can see that recalling her son in his youth brings her momentary joy.She loves that boy, and Hye-ja Kim never forgets that.`Madeo' is a fantastic film that may take a while to get into but is well worth the wait, for once it picks up it delves deep into the heart of paternal compassion and the need to save the ones we love.",5,Mommy dearest...,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",2010,3400,"['took', 'while', 'really', 'get', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'still', 'lingering', 'back', 'mind', 'hard', 'one', 'shake', 'due', 'large', 'part', 'fascinating', 'performance', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'think', 'Imelda', 'Staunton', 'Vera', 'Drake', 'happy-go-lucky', 'overtones', '.The', 'film', 'circles', 'elderly', 'woman', 'search', 'truth', 'regarding', 'murder', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'son', 'prison', 'Call', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'supposedly', 'Yoon', 'Do-joon', 'bars', 'when', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Moon', 'Ah-jung', 'up', 'dead', 'prostrated', 'rooftop', 'whole', 'town', 'see', 'Do-joon', 'mother', 'convinced', 'innocence', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'hurt', 'water', 'bug', 'circumstantial', 'evidence', 'places', 'scene', 'crime', 'thus', 'only', 'one', 'option', 'investigate', 'Scrounging', 'up', 'truth', 'difficult', 'task', 'may', 'lead', 'answers', ""n't"", 'ready', 'stomach', 'something', 'do', 'herself', 'son.I', ""'m"", 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'film', 'noir', 'so', 'tones', 'taken', 'film', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'really', 'appeal', 'darkness', 'films', 'plot', 'really', 'flourish', 'film', 'conclusion', 'emotional', 'gut-punch', 'very', 'subtle', 'kind', 'admire', 'appreciate', 'respect.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'films', 'away', 'even', 'discussion', 'mother', 'motives', 'actions', 'eminent', 'Watching', 'film', 'moral', 'conundrum', 'something', 'be', 'analyzed', 'What', 'will', 'say', 'final', 'moment', 'bus', 'probably', 'most', 'poignant', 'entirety', 'film', 'really', 'mother', 'moral', 'coffin', 'so-to-speak', 'lot', 'how', 'felt', 'end', 'Oldboy', 'Asian', 'masterpiece', 'wrongs', 'committed', 'evils', 'known', 'main', 'character', 'are', 'almost', 'justified', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'connection', 'character', 'when', 'broken', 'down', 'separated', 'situation', 'find', 'inexcusable.The', 'mother', 'choice', 'excuse', 'actions', 'extremely', 'provocative.Color', 'huge', 'fan', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'performance', 'film', 'remarkable', 'example', 'small', 'yet', 'powerful', 'moments', 'culminate', 'very', 'large', 'yet', 'realistically', 'drawn', 'explosions', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'few', 'scattered', 'outbursts', 'are', 'flawlessly', 'rendered', 'carry', 'far', 'more', 'emotional', 'weight', 'manufactured', 'dramatized', 'theatrics', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'today', 'nothing', 'mechanical', 'manipulative', 'performance', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'single', 'moment', 'woman', 'man', 'mother', 'do', ""n't"", 'doubt', 'second', 'determined', 'clear', 'name', 'matter', 'what', 'cost', 'see', 'ounce', 'pain', 'misery', 'etched', 'desperate', 'face', 'What', 'nice', ""n't"", 'shield', 'softer', 'spots', 'woman', 'heart', 'Notice', 'smile', 'when', 'speaking', 'incident', 'when', 'son', 'was', 'five', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'incident', 'can', 'see', 'recalling', 'son', 'youth', 'momentary', 'joy.She', 'boy', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'never', 'that.', 'Madeo', 'fantastic', 'film', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'get', 'well', 'wait', 'once', 'deep', 'heart', 'paternal', 'compassion', 'need', 'save', 'ones', 'love']",Mother

But when the boy is accused of murdering a local teenager her maternal instincts go into overdrive and she refuses to believe he could do such a thing even though his own memories of what happened that fateful night are sketchy at best. Getting nowhere with the attorney she hired to take his case, she decides to do some amateur sleuthing herself with the aid of Do-Joon's unsavory friend Jin-Tae. As the plot becomes increasingly tangled some sordid secrets are laid bare and a thread of truth begins to take shape. Meanwhile, however, Do-Joon is beginning to recall a few memories of his own including a childhood incident Mrs. Yoon would rather keep buried. This is a fast-paced joyride of a film laced with deadpan humour and exhilarating camerawork that has you running down alleyways and hiding in closets.

1347405,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B003JDQJM8,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 0]","Mother and murder in Korean look and sound very similar, so the film plays with that double meaning. Don't want to give it away, but you'll see if you watch it. The story is about a mother and a son who is kind of a retard. Not PC to use that word, but that is what he is called in the film. Actually, that is what it says in the subtitles, as the film is Korean, but whatever the translation, the Korean word has much the same connotations, as whenever the son is called it he reacts. I liked this film a lot, as it is interesting seeing other cultures. It started off kind of farcical, with the mother doing a strange almost David Lynchian dance in a field. The son was also pretty comical, but as it wore on, it took on a much darker film noir tinge.I saw a discussion thread on IMDB and what people wanted to know was who did it? Even after seeing the film, there was some ambiguity over this. The son is the prime suspect, but the mother refuses to accept that and launches her own investigation. Even after seeing it you'll still have questions, as it plays with reality, false memory, and long forgotten memories that may be triggered by acupuncture or a kick in the head. Besides the mother and son, there are plenty of other memorable characters: The cops, the lawyers, the victim, the victim's mother, and her friends. The son has a friend who is a bit of a bad boy, and he is not above letting the simple minded son take the blame.It all makes for a pretty good murder mystery, though it probably stirs up more questions than it answers. And the unanswered questions will haunt you, and the film will echo in your mind for days to come.",4,Word to Your Mother,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,1647,"['Mother', 'murder', 'Korean', 'look', 'sound', 'very', 'similar', 'film', 'double', 'meaning', 'Do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', ""'ll"", 'see', 'watch', 'story', 'mother', 'son', 'who', 'kind', 'retard', 'Not', 'PC', 'use', 'word', 'what', 'called', 'film', 'Actually', 'what', 'subtitles', 'film', 'Korean', 'whatever', 'translation', 'Korean', 'word', 'much', 'same', 'connotations', 'whenever', 'son', 'called', 'liked', 'film', 'lot', 'interesting', 'seeing', 'other', 'cultures', 'started', 'off', 'kind', 'farcical', 'mother', 'doing', 'strange', 'almost', 'David', 'Lynchian', 'dance', 'field', 'son', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'comical', 'wore', 'took', 'much', 'darker', 'film', 'noir', 'tinge.I', 'saw', 'discussion', 'thread', 'IMDB', 'what', 'people', 'wanted', 'know', 'was', 'who', 'did', 'Even', 'seeing', 'film', 'was', 'ambiguity', 'son', 'prime', 'suspect', 'mother', 'accept', 'own', 'investigation', 'Even', 'seeing', ""'ll"", 'still', 'have', 'questions', 'reality', 'false', 'memory', 'long', 'forgotten', 'memories', 'may', 'be', 'triggered', 'acupuncture', 'kick', 'head', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'plenty', 'other', 'memorable', 'characters', 'cops', 'lawyers', 'victim', 'victim', 'mother', 'friends', 'son', 'friend', 'who', 'bit', 'bad', 'boy', 'not', 'letting', 'simple', 'minded', 'son', 'take', 'blame.It', 'pretty', 'good', 'murder', 'mystery', 'probably', 'stirs', 'up', 'more', 'questions', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'will', 'haunt', 'film', 'will', 'echo', 'mind', 'days', 'come']",Mother

After the masterpiece that is Memories of Murder, the great The Host He's definitely followed up with his best film to date, a dark thriller that continues his ability to mix comedy and horror with an absolute brilliant tone in his writing and characters acted perfectly.The tone is what I like about Bong's movies. From the moment the titular Mother walks out of a field and does an improptu dance over the credits you should be able to discern this fact. Unlike the previous Bong movies this is a more measured and quiet film compared to the others as well following the mother along her investigations as to whether her mentally dim son actually killed a school girl who herself might have had incriminating photos on a phone that got her killed. Along the way  she gets one of her sons thugish friends (who she initially thinks could be the killer) to interrogate two boys, and fights with her son when He remembers that she tried to kill him when He was five. Where the story goes is a revelation of the mothers crumbling psyche and regret she has over past  issues.Apparently Bong wrote the film after knowing Kim Hye-ja for several years and she definitely performs the her part well as a sad little woman who has outbursts that mirror her sons violent reactions. The whole cast is just excellent though mixed with a set of actors returning from Bong's previous films my favorites being Jin Gu as Jin Tae, the sons friend and Yoon Jae-Moon as the weary detective investigating the movie.In the end everything works because of Bong's direction and writing from the humor to the horror. The pacing of the movie is perfect creating one of the rare thrillers that doesnt feel the need to mistake noise for thrills, and ends not on an action sequence but a sequence of regret played on someones face, kind of like Memories of Murder.If you haven't seen this movie, do so soon. It as all of Bongs movies are well worth your time.For fans of the movie the Blu-Ray is thankfully well produced. There have been stirrings online about image issues between the original Korean Blu vs. Magnolia's in the area of contrast boosting but aside from some aliasing I didn't really see any problem with it. Soundwise the disc definitely gets excellent marks from me. Extras are also extensive with numerous featurettes ported from the Korean disc and subtitled like a making of, one of Kim Hye-ja, extras casting, the cinematographer and music composer.

The director frames certain shots in such an unexpected manner. He almost loses the subject in the frame. The music score is good.

And, annoyingly smothering motherly love, or, the obsession, And the poor andvery unlikely accusation of the murder conviction to Dojun and another orphan kid by the police(prosecuters), then the poorly featured corrupted lawyer character. To me, the plot was not refined to sit in my head as a great and comprehensive work at all.It is all cacophony, not rather concentrating much into the obsessive, yet, ignorant mother(Kim, Hyeja)'s emotional changes, or perhaps, the betrayal she feels when she finds her son, indeed, killed the poor school girl in-depth.Seeing where Bong, Jun-ho, the director, comes from , and his interviews, I am a little disappointed with his crude plots of the movies.

1347415,A18JUJK45EXE4,B003JDQJM8,Jared M,"[0, 0]","""Mother"" is the story of the mother of Do-joon, a mentally slow 27 year old still living at home.  The mother is an unlicenced acupuncturist who sells medicinal herbs from her small town shop.  After a night on the town, Do-joon is accused of murdering a school girl.  The mother, believing her son innocent, investigates the facts behind the murder and slowly but slowly determines the identity of the murderer.Bong Joon-ho, the Korean director of acclaimed films ""Memories of Murder"" and ""The Host"", has created another modern gem in ""Mother"". Following a slightly bizarre opening in which the mother walks through a meadow and then breaks into a dance, ""Mother"" slowly but assuredly moves forward to its shattering conclusion.  In contrast to his previous effort ""The Host"", there is little in the way of special effects, and ""Mother"" is very much a story driven film.  This is a strength of Bong's; he is able to tell a story without reverting to unnecessary window dressing.  However, the real delight of the film is the portrayal of both the mother (Kim Hye-ja in a poignant performance) and of the son (Won Bin, the younger brother from Taeguk-gi aka ""Brotherhood"").  Both actors put in stellar turns but they are ably assisted by the supporting cast - particularly Jin Ku as Jin-tae, who puts in a crucial turn that belies his initially unsympathetic characterisation.  The film's events takes place in a small (unidentified) town in South Korea, and this has a distinctly grimy and rural feel, both in setting and in its inhabitants.Issues?  Well, this is not a particularly fast paced movie and this is quite reminiscent of another director who knows how to tell a story, Clint Eastwood. Still, I think the pacing could have been picked up in a couple of places, and the director does take his time in establishing his characters before moving to the violent event that really sets the story in motion.  But this is the only fault I could find, and I couldn't bear to mark this film down for that, because it is a brilliant cinematic story in all other respects.",5,Another gem from director Bong Joon-ho,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",2010,2072,"['Mother', 'story', 'mother', 'Do-joon', 'mentally', 'slow', '27', 'year', 'old', 'still', 'living', 'home', 'mother', 'unlicenced', 'acupuncturist', 'who', 'medicinal', 'herbs', 'small', 'town', 'shop', 'night', 'town', 'Do-joon', 'accused', 'murdering', 'school', 'girl', 'mother', 'believing', 'son', 'innocent', 'facts', 'murder', 'slowly', 'slowly', 'identity', 'murderer.Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'Korean', 'director', 'acclaimed', 'films', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'Host', 'created', 'modern', 'gem', 'Mother', 'Following', 'slightly', 'bizarre', 'opening', 'mother', 'meadow', 'then', 'breaks', 'dance', 'Mother', 'slowly', 'assuredly', 'forward', 'shattering', 'conclusion', 'contrast', 'previous', 'effort', 'Host', 'little', 'way', 'special', 'effects', 'Mother', 'very', 'much', 'story', 'driven', 'film', 'strength', 'Bong', 'able', 'tell', 'story', 'reverting', 'unnecessary', 'window', 'dressing', 'However', 'real', 'delight', 'film', 'portrayal', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Hye-ja', 'poignant', 'performance', 'son', 'Won', 'Bin', 'younger', 'brother', 'Taeguk-gi', 'aka', 'Brotherhood', 'actors', 'put', 'stellar', 'turns', 'are', 'ably', 'assisted', 'supporting', 'cast', 'particularly', 'Jin', 'Ku', 'Jin-tae', 'who', 'crucial', 'turn', 'initially', 'unsympathetic', 'characterisation', 'film', 'events', 'place', 'small', 'unidentified', 'town', 'South', 'Korea', 'distinctly', 'grimy', 'rural', 'feel', 'setting', 'inhabitants.Issues', 'Well', 'not', 'particularly', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'quite', 'reminiscent', 'director', 'who', 'how', 'tell', 'story', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Still', 'think', 'pacing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'picked', 'up', 'couple', 'places', 'director', 'take', 'time', 'establishing', 'characters', 'moving', 'violent', 'event', 'really', 'story', 'motion', 'only', 'fault', 'could', 'find', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'mark', 'film', 'down', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'story', 'other', 'respects']",Mother

When the ordinary channels fail her, she increasingly takes things into her own hands, and is not afraid to get those hands dirty.While there are scores of films about fathers out to protect and avenge their children who have been victims of a crime, this is the first that I'm aware of in which it is the mother who is out to defend the accused.  It is a rich and inventive and, also, dark story, beautifully filmed and directed with subtlety, that offers a fresh look at the police procedural film.This offbeat new thriller is sustained by a remarkable performance on the part of the leading lady (Hye Ja Kim as ""The Mother""); all the other performances are strong, but the at once resolute and unhinged performance of the mother is something I couldn't take my eyes off, from the opening scene where she wanders through a field towards the camera, solemn and serious and suddenly breaks into a dance, to the magical ending on a bus.  As with his previous films, Bong Joon Ho manages to convey memories and subjective point of view with a great deal of subtlety, in simple but inventive ways (such as a quick pan to someone who isn't there in the current scene but is being remembered from before).  Highly recommended for lovers of inventive cinema, that explores the boundaries of genre in intriguing ways.The dvd includes a fascinating documentary about the making of ""Mother,"" which offers not only an intriguing look at director Bong Joon Ho in action, but especially emphasizes the importance of mothers in Korean society.  The various participants talk about their relationships with their mothers, and a recurring theme is their sense of duty and guilt for having failed to show them sufficient honor.  Tellingly, the lead character asked his own mother whether she'd be willing to go to the same lengths for him as his fictional mother in the story, and she responded that she would go even further.  Bong Joon Ho explains that the core idea for this story, like that of ""The Host,"" came from an actual incident; the television interview with the aging mother of a fully-grown son who was still living at home and had been accused of heinous crimes, left a deep impression.

1347422,A2QDSG599HSWVA,B003JDQJM8,Patrick Wilkinson,"[2, 3]","""Mother"" is the most recent film from Korean director Joon-Ho Bong (""The Host"", ""Memories of Murder""). Hye-ja Kim plays Mother, the lead character in this brilliantly composed film about the lengths someone will go to protect their children. Yoon Do-joon is a simple, kind boy who for reasons unknown has intermittent amnesia. One day as he is going home he notices a pretty girl walking the same direction. After a few attempts to have a conversation Do-joon moves on and heads home. The next day, we see that the girl has been murdered and witnesses put Do-joon at the scene. Mother, however, knows her son is innocent and will stop at nothing to prove it.What an incredible film! It gives a little, takes a little then gives a little more. As soon as you think you've figured it out, it hits you that you truly haven't. Unlike Hollywood the twists in this movie are perfectly timed and minimal yet they have a big impact. Also, the twists are believable which was a nice surprise.There are a few holes in this movie though. Luckily, they are open to interpretation and is one of the talking points after viewing. Many people feel that the holes are revealed in the story and some feel that they are not, so I'll leave it up to you to decide. Even if there are some loose ends, the other aspects of the film is what makes it so successful.The acting is great as is the script. Hye-ja Kim (Mother) did an incredible job showing range and intensity. There is a scene where she confronts the grieving family of the murdered girl in an effort to convince them of her sons innocence. That scene really showcases the raw talent she has. Another stand out performance was the one from Bin Won (Yoon Do-joon). He did superb bringing a mentally challenge boy to the big screen. It was a great mix of clarity and confusion.As far as sight and sound, this film scores an A+. The musical score is minimal but powerful as in the opening and ending scenes. The cinematography was also great. ""Mother"" takes place in a small town and there are not a lot of flashy colors here. It is more dulled out and dreary but this worked well with the subject matter. Cinematographer Kyung-Pyo Hong's camera work was outstanding. Many scenes had the viewer peering in from behind a wall or through a window watching the action unfold. It added to the uncertainty of the film. The final scene was one to remember as Hong beautifully used reflection (both figuratively and literally) to pack an emotional punch.I highly recommend this movie. Yes, there are some things that didn't work all that well, and yes, there are some plot holes but with a second viewing these could be filled. This is a great film and shows that Korea is an up and coming force in cinema.[...]",4,South Korea is churning out some quality films,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,2741,"['Mother', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Korean', 'director', 'Joon-Ho', 'Bong', 'Host', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'Mother', 'lead', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'composed', 'film', 'lengths', 'someone', 'will', 'go', 'protect', 'children', 'Yoon', 'Do-joon', 'simple', 'kind', 'boy', 'who', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'intermittent', 'amnesia', 'One', 'day', 'going', 'home', 'pretty', 'girl', 'walking', 'same', 'direction', 'few', 'attempts', 'have', 'conversation', 'Do-joon', 'heads', 'home', 'next', 'day', 'see', 'girl', 'been', 'murdered', 'witnesses', 'put', 'Do-joon', 'scene', 'Mother', 'however', 'son', 'innocent', 'will', 'stop', 'nothing', 'prove', 'it.What', 'incredible', 'film', 'little', 'little', 'then', 'little', 'more', 'As', 'soon', 'think', ""'ve"", 'figured', 'out', 'truly', 'have', ""n't"", 'Unlike', 'Hollywood', 'twists', 'movie', 'are', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'minimal', 'yet', 'have', 'big', 'impact', 'Also', 'twists', 'are', 'believable', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise.There', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'movie', 'Luckily', 'are', 'open', 'interpretation', 'one', 'talking', 'points', 'viewing', 'Many', 'people', 'feel', 'holes', 'are', 'revealed', 'story', 'feel', 'are', 'not', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'up', 'decide', 'Even', 'are', 'loose', 'ends', 'other', 'aspects', 'film', 'what', 'successful.The', 'acting', 'great', 'script', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'Mother', 'did', 'incredible', 'job', 'showing', 'range', 'intensity', 'scene', 'where', 'grieving', 'family', 'murdered', 'girl', 'effort', 'convince', 'sons', 'innocence', 'scene', 'really', 'raw', 'talent', 'stand', 'out', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'Bin', 'Won', 'Yoon', 'Do-joon', 'did', 'superb', 'bringing', 'mentally', 'challenge', 'boy', 'big', 'screen', 'was', 'great', 'mix', 'clarity', 'confusion.As', 'far', 'sight', 'sound', 'film', 'A+', 'musical', 'score', 'minimal', 'powerful', 'opening', 'ending', 'scenes', 'cinematography', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'Mother', 'place', 'small', 'town', 'are', 'not', 'lot', 'flashy', 'colors', 'here', 'more', 'dulled', 'out', 'dreary', 'worked', 'well', 'subject', 'matter', 'Kyung-Pyo', 'Hong', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Many', 'scenes', 'had', 'viewer', 'peering', 'wall', 'window', 'watching', 'action', 'unfold', 'added', 'uncertainty', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'was', 'one', 'remember', 'Hong', 'beautifully', 'used', 'reflection', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'pack', 'emotional', 'punch.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'Yes', 'are', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'well', 'yes', 'are', 'plot', 'holes', 'second', 'viewing', 'could', 'be', 'filled', 'great', 'film', 'Korea', 'up', 'coming', 'force', 'cinema.', '[', ']']",Mother

A simple trip to the library had me checking out Bong Joon-ho's ""Mother"", which had won awards for it's lead actress on an International level. Yes, Mother-Love has been examined in many ways, but I beg anyone to say that Hye-ja Kim isn't unique in her approach to her role. She loves her son beyond all else, warts 'n all, and her kid can do no wrong. Mildly developmentally disabled, her son Do-joon (Korean superstar Bin Won) is nothing but sweet and good-natured, with nothing to suspect that he isn't railroaded into a murder confession, if only because the investigators are too lazy to invesigate more deeply. In comes mom, and her passion and pure mother-love gives her an energy and compulsion, to get results, that is obsessive, leading to some interesting developments. I can't blab away the plot any further, but Ms. Kim is amazing & centered;  magnificent in her interpretation. A very noir mood is captured by Mr. Joon-ho, and I'm impressed. Acting by all is terrific, down to the many supporting roles. Be prepared for a few surprise endings; the DVD extras are plentiful. I watched this over a week ago, and I needed time for the power of this film to settle in with me.

While it would be ludicrous to say they're the same film, it's hard to deny that the two films, both of which were big winners at the Asia Pacific Awards (&lt;em>Mother&lt;/em> took best picture, while &lt;em>Poetry&lt;/em> lost by a bare nose to &lt;em>Aftershock&lt;/em>), have some amazing similarities. Both are mysteries, but of a sort Americans have a hard time identifying as mysteries. (&lt;em>Poetry&lt;/em>, where the whodunit bit of the mystery is dispatched with in the first few minutes, is reminiscent of, say, &lt;em>American Beauty&lt;/em> in that regard, while in &lt;em>Mother&lt;/em> the whodunit takes a backseat to the character studies and simple human dramas surrounding it, as is usual in Bong's mysteries; an American equivalent might be &lt;em>Winter's Bone&lt;/em>.) Both feature an older woman in the main role, definitely not the usual hard-boiled private eye, and both of them are a little bit cracked. (Okay, more than a little bit.) Both contain traces of absurdist humor, but in both cases it's ""laugh because the only other option is to cry"" gaggery. And both seem to want us to sympathize with both the craziness and and the desperation of the main characters. But the most important similarity is that both of them succeed.In this one, our title character, only known to us as Mother (&lt;em>Late Autumn&lt;/em>'s Hye-ja Kim in only her fourth role, which amazes me), is tasked with figuring out who framed her equally cracked son Yoon (&lt;em>The Man from Nowhere&lt;/em>'s Bin Won) for the murder of a local schoolgirl Yoon was sweet on. As is usually the case with these sorts of things, nothing is much as it seems, and the farther she digs, the more suspects pop up, and the outright stranger the case gets.But the case, despite the fact that the twist ending here will blow your mind (though in retrospect it's the only one that makes sense), is secondary to use meeting all these wonderful, nutty characters and getting to know them. Like &lt;em>Memories of Murder&lt;/em>, Bong's previous (and even more wonderful) mystery, this si the kind of mystery that it's difficult, if not outright impossible, to imagine this movie coming out of a Hollywood studio. A DIY indie place, maybe, but not a studio. They underestimate the intelligence of the average viewer; why would we want to go see a quiet little movie about weird characters when they could just release &lt;em>Transformers 8: More [censored for Amazon consumption] Blows Up!&lt;/em> and make five hundred million bucks the first weekend?

Only his mother, a feisty, resourceful laborer, is firmly convinced of his innocence, and she will literally stop at nothing to prove he didn't commit the crime.Out of this rather simple premise, a company of South Korean filmmakers has created a masterwork that is equal parts whodunit, dark comedy, filial drama and social commentary.The beauty of the screenplay by Bong Joon-ho and Park Eun-kyo is that you're never entirely certain where it's heading at any given moment, with many an unforeseen twist and turn continually ratcheting up the intrigue and suspense.  Moreover, the writers are not afraid to take the occasional detour off the main narrative highway in order to explore some interesting side street of Korean society.  We're also never quite sure what to make of the relationship between mother and son, for there are hints of some disturbingly dark aspects to go along with the more conventional familial devotion.  And just how far should a mother go in defense of a son?  And can compounding an error ever negate the effect of that error?Hye-ja Kim is splendid as Mother, combining a fiery determination with a trace of humility and the barest touch of madness to devastating effect.  Bin Won is also excellent as her disabled son, as is Ku Jin as his emotionally volatile and occasionally violent best friend.Bong Joon-ho has directed the film with the utmost conviction and power, remaining firmly focused on the character and drama while, at the same time, making the setting and landscape an integral part of the tale.Filled with moral ambiguities and situational ironies that aren't afraid to challenge an audience, this brilliant and offbeat variation on ""Of Mice and Men"" is not to be missed.",5,Astonishing tale of maternal love,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1823,"['Mother', 'mentally-challenged', 'young', 'man', 'falsely', 'accused', 'murdering', 'local', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'Only', 'mother', 'feisty', 'resourceful', 'laborer', 'firmly', 'convinced', 'innocence', 'will', 'literally', 'stop', 'nothing', 'prove', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'crime.Out', 'rather', 'simple', 'premise', 'company', 'South', 'Korean', 'filmmakers', 'created', 'masterwork', 'equal', 'parts', 'whodunit', 'dark', 'comedy', 'filial', 'drama', 'social', 'commentary.The', 'beauty', 'screenplay', 'Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'Park', 'Eun-kyo', ""'re"", 'never', 'entirely', 'certain', 'where', 'heading', 'given', 'moment', 'many', 'unforeseen', 'twist', 'turn', 'continually', 'ratcheting', 'up', 'intrigue', 'suspense', 'Moreover', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'take', 'occasional', 'detour', 'main', 'narrative', 'highway', 'order', 'explore', 'interesting', 'side', 'street', 'Korean', 'society', ""'re"", 'also', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'relationship', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'hints', 'disturbingly', 'dark', 'aspects', 'go', 'along', 'more', 'conventional', 'familial', 'devotion', 'just', 'how', 'far', 'should', 'mother', 'go', 'defense', 'son', 'can', 'compounding', 'error', 'ever', 'negate', 'effect', 'error', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'splendid', 'Mother', 'combining', 'fiery', 'determination', 'trace', 'humility', 'barest', 'touch', 'madness', 'devastating', 'effect', 'Bin', 'Won', 'also', 'excellent', 'disabled', 'son', 'Ku', 'Jin', 'emotionally', 'volatile', 'occasionally', 'violent', 'best', 'friend.Bong', 'Joon-ho', 'directed', 'film', 'utmost', 'conviction', 'power', 'remaining', 'firmly', 'focused', 'character', 'drama', 'same', 'time', 'making', 'setting', 'landscape', 'integral', 'part', 'tale.Filled', 'moral', 'ambiguities', 'situational', 'ironies', 'are', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'challenge', 'audience', 'brilliant', 'offbeat', 'variation', 'Mice', 'Men', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",Mother
1347429,A387BD735MI50R,B003JDQJM8,R. Schultz,"[8, 11]","This South Korean film about a young, mentally challenged man charged with murder has impressive acting and beautiful photography. Its opening image of the young man's mother trying to dance away her despair in a field is probably one of the most striking, evocative images you'll find on film.It's a depressing film for much of its course though - depressing and disillusioning. It disabuses us of any of the stereotypes we might hold of Asian cultures as being somehow superior in politeness and quiet wisdom. Here almost all the town's people are swearing, angry, corrupt, cruel, indifferent, and ready to be triggered into mob violence. However the mother, touchingly portrayed by Hye-ja Kim, holds us riveted by her resolve to exonerate her son.There is also tension and lurking menace everywhere here, enough to almost qualify this film as a psychological thriller. Everyone is either overtly intimidating, or, more chilling yet, subtly threatening. We are kept guessing who might have really committed the murder and draped the young victim in graphic display over a parapet wall.The DVD is in Korean with English subtitles. The subtitles aren't a chore to read though because the dialogue here is often abrupt and sparse. So the reading doesn't interfere with the emotional impact of the film.The extras on the disc are also worth viewing. The bonus features consist of a segment devoted to each of the main directorial talents that go into the making of a major motion picture such as this. We are introduced to the film's overall director, then to the director of photography, then to the musical director. We get to understand a little of what's involved in each facet of production.The bonus segment showing how the musical score for the film was composed and recorded is especially interesting. The musical director decided to score the film with Western music, specifically with music that has the acoustic longing and lament of a Spanish serenade as its underpinning. The music invites us to dance with the vagaries of fate as our partner, and so sets just the right tone for the precarious, selfless odyssey of  ""The Mother.""",5,"Moving, Taut, with Many Twists",1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,2141,"['South', 'Korean', 'film', 'young', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'man', 'charged', 'murder', 'impressive', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'opening', 'image', 'young', 'man', 'mother', 'trying', 'dance', 'away', 'despair', 'field', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'striking', 'evocative', 'images', ""'ll"", 'find', 'film.It', 'depressing', 'film', 'much', 'course', 'depressing', 'disillusioning', 'stereotypes', 'might', 'hold', 'Asian', 'cultures', 'being', 'somehow', 'superior', 'politeness', 'quiet', 'wisdom', 'Here', 'almost', 'town', 'people', 'are', 'swearing', 'angry', 'corrupt', 'cruel', 'indifferent', 'ready', 'be', 'triggered', 'mob', 'violence', 'However', 'mother', 'touchingly', 'portrayed', 'Hye-ja', 'Kim', 'riveted', 'resolve', 'exonerate', 'son.There', 'also', 'tension', 'lurking', 'menace', 'everywhere', 'here', 'enough', 'almost', 'qualify', 'film', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Everyone', 'overtly', 'intimidating', 'more', 'chilling', 'yet', 'subtly', 'threatening', 'are', 'kept', 'guessing', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'really', 'committed', 'murder', 'draped', 'young', 'victim', 'graphic', 'display', 'parapet', 'wall.The', 'DVD', 'Korean', 'English', 'subtitles', 'subtitles', 'are', ""n't"", 'chore', 'read', 'dialogue', 'here', 'often', 'abrupt', 'sparse', 'reading', ""n't"", 'interfere', 'emotional', 'impact', 'film.The', 'extras', 'disc', 'are', 'also', 'worth', 'viewing', 'bonus', 'consist', 'segment', 'devoted', 'main', 'directorial', 'talents', 'go', 'making', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'such', 'are', 'introduced', 'film', 'overall', 'director', 'then', 'director', 'photography', 'then', 'musical', 'director', 'get', 'understand', 'little', 'what', 'involved', 'facet', 'production.The', 'bonus', 'segment', 'showing', 'how', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'was', 'composed', 'recorded', 'especially', 'interesting', 'musical', 'director', 'decided', 'score', 'film', 'Western', 'music', 'specifically', 'music', 'acoustic', 'longing', 'lament', 'Spanish', 'serenade', 'underpinning', 'music', 'dance', 'vagaries', 'fate', 'partner', 'so', 'sets', 'just', 'right', 'tone', 'precarious', 'selfless', 'odyssey', 'Mother']",Mother

This is another fine example of how excellent Asian and in particular Korean cinema has become. This is from the writer and director of `Memories of Murder' (Bong Joon-Ho)and he builds on his reputation here with another brilliantly crafted film.It tells of the story of the `mentally challenged' Do-Jung (played by Bin Won), his mother is a herbal medicine maker and illegal acupuncturist on the side. Her son is slow witted and hangs around with a local n'er do well Jin -Tae. He tends to lead Do-Jung astray but he is easily led. His mother has an almost fanatical devotion to her son which goes to extraordinary lengths to care for him.Do-Jung is supposed to meet Jin-Tae one night at a local bar, but Jin -Tae fails to show. Do-Jung gets very drunk and after passing out is told to get out. On his way home he follows a young girl and tries to talk to her, he is rebuked and goes home. The following day she is found murdered and left in a conspicuous place so is easily found.The police carry out an unimaginative `investigation' and decide it must be Do-Jung. He is so confused that he signs a confession.This is where it kicks off, his mum starts to do anything she can to get him released. The lengths she will go to, know no bounds and her journey to discover the truth reveals more truths than she ever wanted to come out.This is a two hour film that feels like half an hour. It is beautifully shot, the musical score is excellent and the acting superb. This is a story of the human condition, slovenly police and a corrupt system of justice. It could also be called `how far will a mother go?' It had me gripped through out and the unpolished reality of the sets was truly refreshing. If you are a world cinema fan then this is a must see.",5,Korean Testament to the Human Condition,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",2011,1825,"['had', 'been', 'meaning', 'see', 'while', 'now', 'putting', 'off', 'fine', 'example', 'how', 'excellent', 'Asian', 'particular', 'Korean', 'cinema', 'become', 'writer', 'director', 'Memories', 'Murder', 'Bong', 'Joon-Ho', 'reputation', 'here', 'brilliantly', 'crafted', 'film.It', 'tells', 'story', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Do-Jung', 'played', 'Bin', 'Won', 'mother', 'herbal', 'medicine', 'maker', 'illegal', 'acupuncturist', 'side', 'son', 'slow', 'witted', 'hangs', 'local', ""n'er"", 'do', 'well', 'Jin', '-Tae', 'lead', 'Do-Jung', 'astray', 'easily', 'led', 'mother', 'almost', 'fanatical', 'devotion', 'son', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'care', 'him.Do-Jung', 'supposed', 'meet', 'Jin-Tae', 'one', 'night', 'local', 'bar', 'Jin', '-Tae', 'show', 'Do-Jung', 'very', 'drunk', 'passing', 'out', 'told', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'home', 'young', 'girl', 'tries', 'talk', 'rebuked', 'home', 'following', 'day', 'found', 'murdered', 'left', 'conspicuous', 'place', 'so', 'easily', 'found.The', 'police', 'carry', 'out', 'unimaginative', 'investigation', 'decide', 'must', 'be', 'Do-Jung', 'so', 'confused', 'signs', 'confession.This', 'where', 'off', 'mum', 'starts', 'do', 'anything', 'can', 'get', 'released', 'lengths', 'will', 'go', 'know', 'bounds', 'journey', 'discover', 'truth', 'more', 'truths', 'ever', 'wanted', 'come', 'out.This', 'two', 'hour', 'film', 'hour', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'musical', 'score', 'excellent', 'acting', 'superb', 'story', 'human', 'condition', 'slovenly', 'police', 'corrupt', 'system', 'justice', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'called', 'how', 'far', 'will', 'mother', 'go', 'had', 'gripped', 'out', 'unpolished', 'reality', 'sets', 'was', 'truly', 'refreshing', 'are', 'world', 'cinema', 'fan', 'then', 'must', 'see']",Mother
1347433,A96JD9312DHWC,B003JDQJM8,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[0, 0]","The film starts slow, leading you down the path little by little. It isn't a rough thing, either, but a trip that will eventually take you from a land of milk and honey toone that explores a dark relationship between parts of a really disfunctional family.What we have here is a gatewya into a family that is broken in some respect, leading to a mother that is surrounded in some strange disasters. All of this revolves around a mother's love and her 21 year old son who in the moment, is not exactly the most beloved South Korean. One night, while hanging on a few drinks, he meets a girl and then finds that she is gone. Literally, as in prime suspect gone. This leads to some really dark places and some really dark revelations, and to the the mother's day celebration nobody would like to have.There are a lot of movies that seem somewhat like this when they are described but, to me, this is somewhat refreshing in the path it takes. i think that is one of the nice things aobut foreign films; even when you are confronted by an idea you know, you oftentimes do not recognize all of the elements involved because of the cultural differences. I personally find myself intrigued by a lot of things I see in this repsect, and Mother is one of those movies that I really like to watch.As far as acting and plot, this is nice. It is twisted and turns, but it never goes beyond the bending motion that movies oftentimes attempt. That's good, too, because going too far can hurt a nice thing. I could even see The Host in a few really odd ways, with some parts explored in the same rights but these approaches having so many differences. That was interesting as well, although this stands apart and does not merit comparisons until you have watched it a lot of times.consdering the way everything plays out I was glad I picked this up, too, and think more people should. you get a lot in this and you can really miss out if you dance a little too slow. This is a solid 5 star film to me, and I am happy to say that.
