The film starts with Yella accepting a new job and moving to the more modernized western part of the country. With hopes for a better future, the life she leaves behind include her loving father, her obsessive husband, and the stability of a reality understood.Christian Petzold uses a bold no frills approach to exhibit this thought provoking film. The narrative has a minimalistic quality which serves the film well, allowing the viewer to focus on the subtle yet compelling performance by actress Nina Hoss.

1238787,A3A4WQL80WOTMH,B001UE497U,Green Manalishi,"[5, 5]","This is no 1 star movie as another reviewer lamely gave it.  Yella is a weird puzzling film, part thriller, part NOIR, part completely abstract, and by ""abstract"" I mean I didn't ""get"" the ending, or the hints that were building up to it..  Then again who understood the Beatles ""I Am The Walrus""?  Or countless other works of suggestive yet obscure art?  This movie does make suggestions and perhaps there are answers to the inevitable ""what did it mean?""I will say that for the 90 or so minutes that this movie runs, I was engrossed, intrigued and very much in awe of the performances all around.  Nina Hoss (Yella) speaks volumes with her silences (with her voice as well) though for all the silences in this movie, there's water boiling beneath it, an edgy tension that keeps you hooked - the silence itself creates more suspense than any cinematic music could have.  In jazz they say ""Silence swings"".  In this movie it is also the empty places that give meaning to what is there, and lest anybody get the wrong idea, there is quite a bit of dialogue and it's as interesting as any good courtroom drama. The movie moves at a surprisingly quick pace.  It is by no accounts boring.  It is a thriller every bit as exciting as any novel by Grisham.  Only it's obtuse ending and the complete bewilderment that it left me in at the end keep me from giving it 5 stars, although that may be shortsigtedness on my part.  As I write, possible explanations for what the ending may have meant come drifting past like some faint scent that you sense you may almost recognize before it is gone.  This movie would make an interesting forum for discussion.Yella: ""You thought I slept with Schmitt-Ott to get that job.""Philipp: ""That doesn't matter to me.""Yella: ""That's not an answer.""Philipp: ""You're right.""",4,What was that?,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",2009,1798,"['1', 'star', 'movie', 'reviewer', 'lamely', 'gave', 'Yella', 'weird', 'puzzling', 'film', 'part', 'thriller', 'part', 'NOIR', 'part', 'completely', 'abstract', 'abstract', 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'ending', 'hints', 'were', 'building', 'up', 'it..', 'Then', 'again', 'who', 'understood', 'Beatles', 'Am', 'Walrus', 'countless', 'other', 'works', 'suggestive', 'obscure', 'art', 'movie', 'make', 'suggestions', 'perhaps', 'are', 'answers', 'inevitable', 'what', 'did', 'mean', 'will', 'say', '90', 'so', 'minutes', 'movie', 'was', 'engrossed', 'intrigued', 'very', 'much', 'awe', 'performances', 'around', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'Yella', 'volumes', 'silences', 'voice', 'as', 'well', 'silences', 'movie', 'water', 'boiling', 'beneath', 'edgy', 'tension', 'hooked', 'silence', 'more', 'suspense', 'cinematic', 'music', 'could', 'have', 'jazz', 'say', 'Silence', 'swings', 'movie', 'also', 'empty', 'places', 'give', 'meaning', 'what', 'there', 'lest', 'anybody', 'get', 'wrong', 'idea', 'quite', 'bit', 'dialogue', 'as', 'interesting', 'good', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'movie', 'surprisingly', 'quick', 'pace', 'accounts', 'boring', 'thriller', 'bit', 'as', 'exciting', 'novel', 'Grisham', 'Only', 'ending', 'complete', 'bewilderment', 'left', 'end', 'keep', 'giving', '5', 'stars', 'may', 'be', 'shortsigtedness', 'part', 'write', 'possible', 'explanations', 'what', 'ending', 'may', 'have', 'meant', 'come', 'drifting', 'faint', 'scent', 'sense', 'may', 'almost', 'recognize', 'gone', 'movie', 'would', 'make', 'interesting', 'forum', 'discussion.Yella', 'thought', 'slept', 'Schmitt-Ott', 'get', 'job', 'Philipp', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Yella', 'not', 'answer', 'Philipp', ""'re"", 'right']",N/A

The DVD needs a warning, particularly to non-German audiences, because this abstract (meaning - it's so obscure you can read whatever you want into it) parable has allusions embedded in German history and economics.(2.) Filmed largely in a car being driven from one room to another  (total of about four rooms). A woman (Yella) is looking for a job, has had a bad marriage, stole some money, died in a car accident.(3.) Acting - hard to say since half of the movie focused on Yella sitting and essentially not doing much. Except close-ups suggest that the audience should look for deep subtle facial expressions.(4.)

1238789,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B001UE497U,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","&#34;Yella&#34; (2007 release from Germany; 89 min.) brings the story of Yella (played by Nina Hoss), whom we get to know as the movie opens with her arrival at the train station. She is stalked by Ben, who must be a bitter ex-boyfriend or significant other. Yella arrives at her father's house and excitedly informs him she found a job in the big city (Hanover). She will take the train to Hanover the next morning. Next morning, instead of the expected cab driver, it is Ben who offers to take her to the train station. Yella reluctantly agrees. To tell you more would ruin your viewing pleasure of this plot-heavy movie, you'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: &#34;Yella&#34; completes German director Christian Petzold's so-called &#34;ghost&#34; trilogy (started with &#34;The State I Am In&#34; in 2000, and continued with &#34;Ghosts&#34; in 2005). While these three movies are plot-wise unrelated to each other, there are clearly certain themes coming back, none more so than a critical look at how Germans are adjusting to the &#34;new&#34; (i.e. post-unification) Germany. Second, without giving anything away from the plot of &#34;Yella&#34;, just know that this movie deals quite a bit with venture capital. Yes, that seems quite a stretch from the quick introduction that I wrote up earlier, you'll just have to see how the movie gets there, and get ready for a wild ride along the way. Third, Just as Petzold relied on Julia Hummer for &#34;The State I Am In&#34; and &#34;Ghosts&#34;, he now puts the movie's weight on Nina Hoss, and she comes through brilliantly. Not surprisingly, Petzold has called on her again in his subsequent movies (2008's &#34;Jerichow&#34; and 2012's brilliant &#34;Barbara&#34;).  Fourth, the DVD comes with several nice extras. There is a 50 min. documentary called &#34;Nothing Ventured&#34; about venture capital in Germany, and from which Petzold took some inspiration when writing &#34;Yella&#34;. Then there is an 8 page film essay about Petzold and  &#34;Yella&#34; from a German film critic which puts all of this in a delightful context. Excellent reading material AFTER you have seen &#34;Yella&#34;.Bottom line: in my humble opinion, Christian Petzold is one of the very best European movie directors of this generation, and his entire &#34;ghost&#34; trilogy makes for compelling and riveting viewing. If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign movie that will take you on quite a wild ride, even if it involves something as potentially boring as accounting and venture capitalism, you cannot go wrong with this. &#34;Yella&#34; is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4,Get ready for a wild ride,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,2644,"['34', 'Yella', '34', '2007', 'release', 'Germany', '89', 'min', 'story', 'Yella', 'played', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'whom', 'get', 'know', 'movie', 'arrival', 'train', 'station', 'stalked', 'Ben', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'bitter', 'ex-boyfriend', 'significant', 'other', 'Yella', 'father', 'house', 'excitedly', 'informs', 'found', 'job', 'big', 'city', 'Hanover', 'will', 'take', 'train', 'Hanover', 'next', 'morning', 'Next', 'morning', 'instead', 'expected', 'cab', 'driver', 'Ben', 'who', 'take', 'train', 'station', 'reluctantly', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'plot-heavy', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', '34', 'Yella', '34', 'completes', 'German', 'director', 'Christian', 'Petzold', 'so-called', '34', 'ghost', '34', 'trilogy', 'started', '34', 'State', 'Am', '34', '2000', 'continued', '34', 'Ghosts', '34', '2005', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'plot-wise', 'unrelated', 'other', 'are', 'clearly', 'certain', 'themes', 'coming', 'back', 'none', 'more', 'so', 'critical', 'look', 'how', 'Germans', 'are', 'adjusting', '34', 'new', '34', 'i.e', 'post-unification', 'Germany', 'Second', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'plot', '34', 'Yella', '34', 'just', 'know', 'movie', 'quite', 'bit', 'venture', 'capital', 'Yes', 'quite', 'stretch', 'quick', 'introduction', 'wrote', 'up', 'earlier', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'there', 'get', 'ready', 'wild', 'ride', 'way', 'Third', 'Just', 'Petzold', 'relied', 'Julia', 'Hummer', '34', 'State', 'Am', '34', '34', 'Ghosts', '34', 'now', 'movie', 'weight', 'Nina', 'Hoss', 'brilliantly', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Petzold', 'called', 'again', 'subsequent', 'movies', '2008', '34', 'Jerichow', '34', '2012', 'brilliant', '34', 'Barbara', '34', 'Fourth', 'DVD', 'several', 'nice', 'extras', '50', 'min', 'documentary', 'called', '34', 'Nothing', 'Ventured', '34', 'venture', 'capital', 'Germany', 'Petzold', 'took', 'inspiration', 'when', 'writing', '34', 'Yella', '34', 'Then', '8', 'page', 'film', 'essay', 'Petzold', '34', 'Yella', '34', 'German', 'film', 'critic', 'delightful', 'context', 'Excellent', 'reading', 'material', 'AFTER', 'have', 'seen', '34', 'Yella', '34', '.Bottom', 'line', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Christian', 'Petzold', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'European', 'movie', 'directors', 'generation', 'entire', '34', 'ghost', '34', 'trilogy', 'compelling', 'riveting', 'viewing', 'are', 'mood', 'top-notch', 'foreign', 'movie', 'will', 'take', 'wild', 'ride', 'even', 'something', 'potentially', 'boring', 'accounting', 'venture', 'capitalism', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'wrong', '34', 'Yella', '34', 'HIGHLY', 'RECOMMENDED']",N/A

Now, there's nothing wrong with that: I love riddle-like movies that often alienate others, but here the meat of the movie is too slight to carry the mystery. Yella's experiences on her vaguely picaresque journey fail to compel in the way intended. It's never boring but most of the fascination is supplied by Hoss's reticent performance, which is wistful and haunting. Another failure is the final twist, which is all too obvious quite early on and produces a sigh rather than a gasp.
