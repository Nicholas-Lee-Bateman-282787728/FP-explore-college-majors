They are appropriate for ages about 18 months to about 3.My young girl who is 5 sometimes will watch them with her little brother age 3, but it is not her favorite video any more and she knows all the answers now.This one talks about shapes and colors and teaches a variety of shapes and colors in a pleasing, fun way. It encourages children to shout out answers, look for clues and use their thinking skills to solve problems all while teaching them about colors and shapes. This video also teaches colors not normally taught and how to mix other colors to get new colors. It also teaches different shapes than ones you might expect (polygon).Well worth the money.Enjoy.",5,Very Educational and Palatable for adults,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,773,"['Blue', 'Clues', 'videos', 'are', 'very', 'educational', 'are', 'very', 'fun', 'very', 'gentle', 'young', 'children', 'are', 'appropriate', 'ages', '18', 'months', '3.My', 'young', 'girl', 'who', '5', 'sometimes', 'will', 'watch', 'little', 'brother', 'age', '3', 'not', 'favorite', 'video', 'more', 'answers', 'now.This', 'one', 'talks', 'shapes', 'colors', 'variety', 'shapes', 'colors', 'pleasing', 'fun', 'way', 'children', 'shout', 'out', 'answers', 'look', 'clues', 'use', 'thinking', 'skills', 'solve', 'problems', 'teaching', 'colors', 'shapes', 'video', 'also', 'colors', 'not', 'normally', 'taught', 'how', 'mix', 'other', 'colors', 'get', 'new', 'colors', 'also', 'different', 'shapes', 'ones', 'might', 'expect', 'polygon', '.Well', 'money.Enjoy']",N/A

Now that he's 18 months, I ordered this DVD to help him learn about shapes and colors. It's not a bad introduction to the world of Blue's Clues. I remember baby sitting children during the hey-days of Barney and I found Blue's Clues much more palatable. As for my son, he loves it and bops around to the songs and watches the guy as he names the shapes.

Little kids absorb this stuff like sponges, the movie teaches parallelograms, trapezoids and octagons!  Very entertaining, funny, wonderful learning tools.  Shows kids how to make different colors, some are aquamarine and chartreuse.  Also teaches the basic stuff, but I would recommend this one because it does teach more extensive shapes.  I have never seen a trapezoid or parallelogram in any other video for kids, why not?

It makes drawing with him pretty funny sometimes.We only ever watch the Shapes episode and the Colors episode.

The Joe episodes just seem better produced and more coherent than the others, too.(And if you don't know, Blue's Clues was actually developed with the help of Child Development experts and such.
