This series tells the ups and downs of these relationships and how their love becomes stronger when they experience these situations. This series has it all, romance, comedy, and a great storyline. I would recommend this series for any shonen-ai fan or anyone whose is looking for a great addition to their shonen-ai collection.",5,Junjou Romantica Season 1 DVD Collection,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,411,"['shonen-ai', 'series', 'story', '3', 'couples', 'Romantica', 'Egoist', 'Terrorist', 'series', 'ups', 'downs', 'relationships', 'how', 'love', 'becomes', 'stronger', 'when', 'experience', 'situations', 'series', 'romance', 'comedy', 'great', 'storyline', 'would', 'recommend', 'series', 'shonen-ai', 'fan', 'anyone', 'looking', 'great', 'addition', 'shonen-ai', 'collection']",Junjo Romantica Season 1

I usually watch anime like Higurashi, Berserk, Monster, School Rumble, Oran, you name it. There is one other beside this I watched and that was gravitation which was alright. My biggest problem with these types of anime is story. Junjo Romantica doesn't have much story. Its basically switching between 4 or related guys who find romance with other guys. There is some conflict in the story but its not really anything to worry about or put you on the edge. This isn't too bad, but its kind of boring. The show does have hillarious moments but I've seen better. MY other problem is the character designs. It looks like the makers recycled the look and design of the characters. Some of the characters really do look alike which got me pretty confused. I know its a romance anime, but I've seen romances that are extremely compelling in story and that are overall better. This isn't one of them. Other than that I kind of liked this show. It was a good vacation from the chaos and action in Blue Lagoon. There are 2 seasons. I made it through the entire first season and in the second season I'm on I think episode 6 a long while back. I hope to finish the rest of the season after watching Higurashi No Naku Koro ni.",3,Hillarious but not really my type of anime.,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",2010,1255,"['do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'watch', 'yaoi', 'type', 'anime', 'usually', 'watch', 'anime', 'Higurashi', 'Berserk', 'Monster', 'School', 'Rumble', 'Oran', 'name', 'one', 'other', 'watched', 'was', 'gravitation', 'was', 'alright', 'biggest', 'problem', 'types', 'anime', 'story', 'Junjo', 'Romantica', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'story', 'basically', 'switching', '4', 'related', 'guys', 'who', 'find', 'romance', 'other', 'guys', 'conflict', 'story', 'not', 'really', 'anything', 'worry', 'put', 'edge', ""n't"", 'too', 'bad', 'kind', 'boring', 'show', 'have', 'hillarious', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'better', 'MY', 'other', 'problem', 'character', 'makers', 'recycled', 'look', 'design', 'characters', 'characters', 'really', 'do', 'look', 'alike', 'got', 'pretty', 'confused', 'know', 'romance', 'anime', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'romances', 'are', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'story', 'are', 'overall', 'better', ""n't"", 'one', 'Other', 'kind', 'liked', 'show', 'was', 'good', 'vacation', 'chaos', 'action', 'Blue', 'Lagoon', 'are', '2', 'seasons', 'made', 'entire', 'first', 'season', 'second', 'season', ""'m"", 'think', 'episode', '6', 'long', 'while', 'back', 'hope', 'finish', 'rest', 'season', 'watching', 'Higurashi', 'No', 'Naku', 'Koro', 'ni']",Junjo Romantica Season 1

1327524,A182VTJIIEVM37,B0036BDQ60,GintaxAlvissforever,"[2, 3]","Animes like these make me wish that there were better quality anime in terms of realism. In reality, I think Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi is way better than Romantica but this review isn't about talking about that.Season 1 is the beginning introducing the three main couples Romantica, Egoist and Terrorist. Each pairing has their own struggles that makes you route for them but...I still have issues with each pairing...mainly the stereotypes that come with the anime.Romantica: The main pairing you're supposed to love. Reading the manga, this pairing gets boring REALLY fast and its a shame because there's a lot of potential. The first episode is off to a rough stuff with Usagi raping Misaki (the anime tones this down but sheesh, people wonder why yaoi fangirls are labeled as insane when the main pairing is the one that starts with rape). The entire plot is recycled over and over again to the point of it getting boring. Either Misaki gets jealous of one of Usagi's friends or Usagi gets insanely jealous of the people that hang out with Misaki and keeps showing possessive qualities that would make me want to compare him to Edward Cullen. The only difference is as the season goes on, Misaki DOES grow a backbone and can yell at Usagi (its still not that effective but still). The few episodes that break the jealousy trend (which is a recurring theme for all of the pairings but it doesn't overshadow them like this one) are the rare ones that I really like. Overall, I just find Misaki annoying when he can't even say ""I love you"" to Usagi and I get mad at Usagi for making me want to compare him to Edward Cullen of all people. Alas, this is only season 1 with these episodes so it gets better anyway.Egoist: The pairing that everyone ends up loving the most mainly because there is no rape involved and while the feelings are mutual and sex is consensual, the way the relationship is handled dips into domestic abuse at times on Hiroki's end. Now I love tsundere characters (and hate yandere) characters but I feel like Hiroki is not a very good tsundere. At the beginning, his tsundere personality was caused by a broken heart. Nowaki is a very nice guy though and should have been able to heal Hiroki's heart but the fact that they've been dating the longest (but they're so terrified of their small age gap but compared to the other pairings, its nothing) should have Hiroki calm down. I won't bring it up this review (I'll do that with season 2) but Hiroki doesn't seem to change his tsundere ways that its just flat out being obnoxious and Nowaki takes it like a martyr. Uh...alas, there story arc is the one that made me tear up though (but it still could have been avoided if Hiroki wasn't such a tsundere and listened to Nowaki).Terrorist: Personally this is my favorite pairing but is the one that has the most controversy around it due to the circumstances around it. You got Miyagi a teacher who has a 17 year old high school student interested in him. The age gap is the main reason for the controversy and not because the pairing isn't boring (I don't find it boring). Basically, Miyagi was in love with his old teacher and when she died, he couldn't love again and has had failed relationships as a result. Come Shinobu who comes into his life during the day of his wedding of Shinobu's sister...yeah. That's why it's awkward. Once the two divorced, Shinobu made his move on Miyagi...and Shinobu is the son of the head of the college Miyagi works at. The idea of getting caught and a scandal happening makes me excited...but Nakamura would never think of something like that. -_- They get the fewest episodes by default, but there episodes were different from the other two pairings and that's probably why I like them the most.Music: The music is wonderful especially the opening. The art is amazing and this was before Japan's law that decided to tone down sex scenes (so we can get better scenes than just kissing that Sekai Ichi Hatsukoi suffered).Overall, the first season is a good start and beside me ranting about the pairings, I think you'll be able to find a pairing you like. They get better in season 2...some of them.",4,One of the Better Yaoi Animes in Terms of Realism,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2013,4150,"['Animes', 'make', 'wish', 'were', 'better', 'quality', 'anime', 'terms', 'realism', 'reality', 'think', 'Sekai', 'Ichi', 'Hatsukoi', 'way', 'better', 'Romantica', 'review', ""n't"", 'talking', 'that.Season', '1', 'beginning', 'introducing', 'three', 'main', 'couples', 'Romantica', 'Egoist', 'Terrorist', 'pairing', 'own', 'struggles', 'route', 'still', 'have', 'issues', 'pairing', 'mainly', 'stereotypes', 'come', 'anime.Romantica', 'main', 'pairing', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'love', 'Reading', 'manga', 'pairing', 'boring', 'REALLY', 'fast', 'shame', 'lot', 'potential', 'first', 'episode', 'rough', 'stuff', 'Usagi', 'raping', 'Misaki', 'anime', 'down', 'sheesh', 'people', 'wonder', 'why', 'yaoi', 'fangirls', 'are', 'labeled', 'insane', 'when', 'main', 'pairing', 'one', 'rape', 'entire', 'plot', 'recycled', 'over', 'again', 'point', 'getting', 'boring', 'Misaki', 'jealous', 'one', 'Usagi', 'friends', 'Usagi', 'insanely', 'jealous', 'people', 'hang', 'out', 'Misaki', 'showing', 'possessive', 'qualities', 'would', 'make', 'want', 'compare', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'only', 'difference', 'season', 'Misaki', 'DOES', 'grow', 'backbone', 'can', 'yell', 'Usagi', 'still', 'not', 'effective', 'still', 'few', 'episodes', 'break', 'jealousy', 'trend', 'recurring', 'theme', 'pairings', ""n't"", 'overshadow', 'one', 'are', 'rare', 'ones', 'really', 'Overall', 'just', 'find', 'Misaki', 'annoying', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'love', 'Usagi', 'get', 'mad', 'Usagi', 'making', 'want', 'compare', 'Edward', 'Cullen', 'people', 'Alas', 'only', 'season', '1', 'episodes', 'better', 'anyway.Egoist', 'pairing', 'everyone', 'up', 'loving', 'most', 'mainly', 'rape', 'involved', 'feelings', 'are', 'mutual', 'sex', 'consensual', 'way', 'relationship', 'handled', 'dips', 'domestic', 'abuse', 'times', 'Hiroki', 'end', 'Now', 'love', 'tsundere', 'characters', 'hate', 'yandere', 'characters', 'feel', 'Hiroki', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'tsundere', 'beginning', 'tsundere', 'personality', 'was', 'caused', 'broken', 'heart', 'Nowaki', 'very', 'nice', 'guy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'heal', 'Hiroki', 'heart', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'been', 'dating', 'longest', ""'re"", 'so', 'terrified', 'small', 'age', 'gap', 'compared', 'other', 'pairings', 'nothing', 'should', 'have', 'Hiroki', 'calm', 'down', 'wo', ""n't"", 'bring', 'up', 'review', ""'ll"", 'do', 'season', '2', 'Hiroki', ""n't"", 'seem', 'change', 'tsundere', 'ways', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'being', 'obnoxious', 'Nowaki', 'martyr', 'Uh', 'alas', 'story', 'arc', 'one', 'made', 'tear', 'up', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'Hiroki', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'tsundere', 'listened', 'Nowaki', '.Terrorist', 'Personally', 'favorite', 'pairing', 'one', 'most', 'controversy', 'due', 'circumstances', 'got', 'Miyagi', 'teacher', 'who', '17', 'year', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'interested', 'age', 'gap', 'main', 'reason', 'controversy', 'not', 'pairing', ""n't"", 'boring', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'boring', 'Basically', 'Miyagi', 'was', 'love', 'old', 'teacher', 'when', 'died', 'could', ""n't"", 'love', 'again', 'had', 'failed', 'relationships', 'result', 'Come', 'Shinobu', 'who', 'life', 'day', 'wedding', 'Shinobu', 'sister', 'yeah', 'why', 'awkward', 'Once', 'two', 'divorced', 'Shinobu', 'made', 'move', 'Miyagi', 'Shinobu', 'son', 'head', 'college', 'Miyagi', 'idea', 'getting', 'caught', 'scandal', 'happening', 'excited', 'Nakamura', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'something', '-_-', 'get', 'fewest', 'episodes', 'default', 'there', 'episodes', 'were', 'different', 'other', 'two', 'pairings', 'probably', 'why', 'like', 'most.Music', 'music', 'wonderful', 'especially', 'opening', 'art', 'amazing', 'was', 'Japan', 'law', 'decided', 'tone', 'down', 'sex', 'scenes', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'scenes', 'just', 'kissing', 'Sekai', 'Ichi', 'Hatsukoi', 'suffered', '.Overall', 'first', 'season', 'good', 'start', 'beside', 'ranting', 'pairings', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'find', 'pairing', 'like', 'get', 'better', 'season', '2']",Junjo Romantica Season 1
