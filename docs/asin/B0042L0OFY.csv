It is not a particularly pleasant movie, although it has some tender moments, and yes, I wish it had ended differently, but it addresses important subjects like religious hypocrisy, loss of faith, euthanasia, homophobia, and the brutality of prison life.  Kudos to directors/writers Darren Flaxstone and Christian Martin for tackling such serious matters.Catholic priest Father Jack (Daniel Brocklebank) is imprisoned for an unspecified crime.  There he experiences unspeakable acts of violence, yet manages to fall in love with Martin (Garry Summer), an idealistic guard.  Their affair, however, is short-lived, but they both look forward to the time when Jack is released and they can be together again.  Unfortunately for them, the title of the film has more than one meaning.The production values are quite high for a low-budget film.  The prison setting is eerie and claustrophobic.Brocklebank gives a terrific performance.  Summer is also quite good.  The rest of the cast is fine.This film is not without its flaws.  The sound is quite murky at times, making it difficult to understand the dialogue.  The score also has a tendency to drown out the quieter moments.  At one point the soundtrack is out of sync with the picture.  Of course, these sound problems could be the fault of the transfer to DVD rather than the movie itself.  More problematic is the murkiness of the plot.  The story is non-linear, jumping back and forth in time, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The use of dreams and fantasies make things rather confusing at times.  Some of the characters are bizarre, and some of the situations are improbable.The sex scenes are restrained (a negative for some viewers), while the violence is graphic (also a negative for some, including me).This is definitely not a feel-good movie.

Then I wouldn't have waisted my money or the hour I struggleed thru it before turning it off. Very poor story line, Too many flash back,  Heavy accents. Just a very poor story line. A lot of the same actors from SHANK are in this movie which leads me to believe either they were filmed together or just a lack of actors wanting the poorly written parts.DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME.",2,Can I get the Hour back?,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,444,"['should', 'have', 'waited', 'order', 'movie', 'watched', 'SHANK', 'Then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'waisted', 'money', 'hour', 'struggleed', 'thru', 'turning', 'off', 'Very', 'poor', 'story', 'line', 'Too', 'many', 'flash', 'back', 'Heavy', 'accents', 'Just', 'very', 'poor', 'story', 'line', 'lot', 'same', 'actors', 'SHANK', 'are', 'movie', 'believe', 'either', 'were', 'filmed', 'together', 'just', 'lack', 'actors', 'wanting', 'poorly', 'written', 'parts.DO', ""N'T"", 'WAIST', 'YOUR', 'TIME']",N/A

The prison culture is more raw, less civilized than the outside society, but not much different.  Hypocrisy in the Roman Catholic Church worries the gay priest.  Orphaned at a young age, the older brother cares for his brother, plays the parent role right on into becoming a Father of the Church.  But the moral stance of the institution is inhumane.  Here the Church and the Prison mirror each other.  Within the Prison are the same forces of death and destruction, deceit and hidden dangers which the Priest found in &#34;straight&#34; society.  His highly protective sense of fairness and willingness to act on his values brings him erotic love as a reward.  The jailor as lover/prisoner as lover duality creates tension for the lovers and for the environment.  Evil lurks in the prison.  Power is hard to see, unless you are familiar with its Dark forms.  The priest knows the Shadow side of the Church's power structure, but is an innocent lamb in this environment, as is his idealistic &#34;Christian&#34; guard lover.  This is an archetypal piece, a tragedy like the Passion, but unlike the traditional version we get to see the nude body in all its beauty.",4,The Passion of Christ and the Problem of Evil,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,1263,"['Compassion', 'pivot', 'point', 'film', 'When', 'one', 'act', 'love', 'consequences', 'follow', 'prison', 'culture', 'more', 'raw', 'less', 'civilized', 'outside', 'society', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'Hypocrisy', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'gay', 'priest', 'Orphaned', 'young', 'age', 'older', 'brother', 'cares', 'brother', 'parent', 'role', 'right', 'becoming', 'Father', 'Church', 'moral', 'stance', 'institution', 'inhumane', 'Here', 'Church', 'Prison', 'mirror', 'other', 'Prison', 'are', 'same', 'forces', 'death', 'destruction', 'deceit', 'hidden', 'dangers', 'Priest', 'found', '34', 'straight', '34', 'society', 'highly', 'protective', 'sense', 'fairness', 'willingness', 'act', 'values', 'erotic', 'love', 'reward', 'jailor', 'as', 'lover/prisoner', 'lover', 'duality', 'tension', 'lovers', 'environment', 'Evil', 'prison', 'Power', 'hard', 'see', 'are', 'familiar', 'Dark', 'forms', 'priest', 'Shadow', 'side', 'Church', 'power', 'structure', 'innocent', 'lamb', 'environment', 'idealistic', '34', 'Christian', '34', 'guard', 'lover', 'archetypal', 'piece', 'tragedy', 'Passion', 'traditional', 'version', 'get', 'see', 'nude', 'body', 'beauty']",N/A
