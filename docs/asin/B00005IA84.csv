581871,A27Q80GZDFZ92K,B00005IA84,Amateur Stargazer,"[1, 1]","This collection of Twilight Zone has the pilot, a great episode, and two entertaining stories.  ""Where Is Everybody"" is a study in loneliness when a young man finds himself trapped in a town without people.  Serling's original introduction to the series is included before the episode.  This must be an early version because another narrator (not Serling) opens and closes the story.  In the other Twilight Zone shows Serling always appears in person-- even in a later version of this episode included in the ""Treasures of the Twilight Zone"". ""Eye of the Beholder"", one of Twilight Zone's best ventures, is about standards of beauty and the acceptance of people. A man believes that machines are conspiring against him in ""A Thing about Machines"". ""A World of His Own"" is a humorous tale about a playwright whose creations come to life.  This DVD has both well known classics and rare items from the Twilight Zone and will make a fine addition to the collection of those who love vintage science fiction.  Many of the volumes each contain at least one or two of my favorite Twilight Zone stories, and they cost much less than the sets of the complete seasons. The only thing that would be better than this would be choosing individual episodes for your own DVD's, but having three or four shows chosen for you on each disc with some being great and others decent is probably the next best thing.",4,A very good collection,1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,1395,"['collection', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'pilot', 'great', 'episode', 'two', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'study', 'loneliness', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'trapped', 'town', 'people', 'Serling', 'original', 'introduction', 'series', 'included', 'episode', 'must', 'be', 'early', 'version', 'narrator', 'not', 'Serling', 'opens', 'story', 'other', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Serling', 'always', 'person', 'even', 'later', 'version', 'episode', 'included', 'Treasures', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'one', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'best', 'ventures', 'standards', 'beauty', 'acceptance', 'people', 'man', 'machines', 'are', 'conspiring', 'A', 'Thing', 'Machines', 'World', 'Own', 'humorous', 'tale', 'playwright', 'creations', 'come', 'life', 'DVD', 'well', 'known', 'classics', 'rare', 'items', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'will', 'make', 'fine', 'addition', 'collection', 'who', 'love', 'vintage', 'science', 'fiction', 'Many', 'volumes', 'contain', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'favorite', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'stories', 'cost', 'much', 'less', 'sets', 'complete', 'seasons', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'would', 'be', 'choosing', 'individual', 'episodes', 'own', 'DVD', 'having', 'three', 'four', 'shows', 'chosen', 'disc', 'being', 'great', 'others', 'decent', 'probably', 'next', 'best', 'thing']",N/A
581872,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B00005IA84,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Four exceptional episodes from THE TWILIGHT ZONE occupy this, the 43rd and final volume of the DVD compilations of the show.  3 of the episodes are amongst my all-time favourites and illustrate the versatility of the series' tone and flavour within the stories told.EYE OF THE BEHOLDER (Season 2, Episode #6) is one of the most subversive stories in the ""Zone""'s history.  Janet Tyler is evidently horribly disfigured and awaiting the outcome of an operation that promises to make her look ""just like everyone else"".  Donna Douglas, the pert blonde star of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" adds an extra dimension to the lead role.  Chilling stuff.A THING ABOUT MACHINES (Season 2, Episode #4) stars Richard Haydn as Bartlett Finchley, a reclusive bachelor with a violent hatred of technology.  This episode also explores the increasing impact that technology imposes in our everyday lives - whether we want it or not.  Woe betide the irritable Bartlett Finchley when his appliances, tired of being smashed and kicked, want revenge...A WORLD OF HIS OWN (Season 1, Episode #36) is the breath of fresh air on this DVD.  One of the ""Zone""'s most delightful comedy stories, it stars Keenan Wynn as Gregory West, an author who can literally summon his fictional characters into the real world simply by dictating into his tape recorder.  When he cannot convince his wife Victoria (Phyllis Kirk) that the beautiful blonde (Mary La Roche) that he was seen canoodling with on the sofa is just a figment of his imagination, Gregory reveals that Victoria herself is also just a piece of tape...This disc also includes the unaired ""sponsor's pilot"" version of WHERE IS EVERYBODY?, the ""Zone""'s premiere episode, along with the regular Rod Serling bio and series notes seen on all the other individual TWILIGHT ZONE DVD releases.",4,"3 more fabulous tales from the ""Zone""...",1363392000,"03 16, 2013",2013,1810,"['Four', 'exceptional', 'episodes', 'THE', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'occupy', '43rd', 'final', 'volume', 'DVD', 'compilations', 'show', '3', 'episodes', 'are', 'amongst', 'all-time', 'favourites', 'illustrate', 'versatility', 'series', 'tone', 'flavour', 'stories', 'told.EYE', 'THE', 'BEHOLDER', 'Season', '2', 'Episode', '6', 'one', 'most', 'subversive', 'stories', 'Zone', 'history', 'Janet', 'Tyler', 'evidently', 'horribly', 'disfigured', 'awaiting', 'outcome', 'operation', 'make', 'look', 'just', 'everyone', 'else', 'Donna', 'Douglas', 'pert', 'blonde', 'star', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', 'extra', 'dimension', 'lead', 'role', 'Chilling', 'stuff.A', 'THING', 'ABOUT', 'MACHINES', 'Season', '2', 'Episode', '4', 'stars', 'Richard', 'Haydn', 'Bartlett', 'Finchley', 'reclusive', 'bachelor', 'violent', 'hatred', 'technology', 'episode', 'also', 'increasing', 'impact', 'technology', 'imposes', 'everyday', 'want', 'not', 'Woe', 'irritable', 'Bartlett', 'Finchley', 'when', 'appliances', 'tired', 'being', 'smashed', 'kicked', 'want', 'revenge', 'A', 'WORLD', 'HIS', 'OWN', 'Season', '1', 'Episode', '36', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'DVD', 'One', 'Zone', 'most', 'delightful', 'comedy', 'stories', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Gregory', 'West', 'author', 'who', 'can', 'literally', 'summon', 'fictional', 'characters', 'real', 'world', 'simply', 'dictating', 'tape', 'recorder', 'When', 'can', 'not', 'convince', 'wife', 'Victoria', 'Phyllis', 'Kirk', 'beautiful', 'blonde', 'Mary', 'La', 'Roche', 'was', 'seen', 'canoodling', 'sofa', 'just', 'figment', 'imagination', 'Gregory', 'Victoria', 'also', 'just', 'piece', 'tape', 'disc', 'also', 'unaired', 'sponsor', 'pilot', 'version', 'WHERE', 'IS', 'EVERYBODY', 'Zone', 'premiere', 'episode', 'regular', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'bio', 'series', 'notes', 'seen', 'other', 'individual', 'TWILIGHT', 'ZONE', 'DVD']",N/A

A man alone (Earl Holliman) finds himself totally isolated in an unfamiliar town, yet with very familiar surroundings found in any ""Hometown America"" setting. But, who is he, where is he and why is he there?""Eye Of The Beholder"" says it all. Janet Tyler will have to have her bandages removed from her face to reveal if the operation was a success or not. But, there is more than meets the eye to that question and Bernard Herrmann's score brilliantly sets the mood for this very powerful study into the human psyche.I always loved ""A Thing About Machines"" and that probably should credited to insightful scriptwriting, Richard Hayden's brilliant performance and actually some very impressionable visions depicted here of machines taking on an actual persona and turning on Hayden. In today's world, I wonder if we are actually at this point considering the supposed advances of technology in this day and age.""A World Of His Own"" is another favorite of mine and this episode somehow seems timeless. For anyone who puts pen and ink to paper and creates characters that traverse a world they create in the mind, this should be a welcome episode.  Keenan Wynn does just that, though using a Dictaphone, in the comfortable surroundings of his den. Keenan Wynn's creations however become reality in this light comedy. This episode is thoroughly enjoyable, very memorable and quite ingenious. It also has a very unique ending that I must not give away.Well, that's it for now. I decided to start reviewing Twilight Zone episodes again somewhere back there where I left off. I cannot say enough about the Twilight Zone.

581876,A366S12KCZ280V,B00005IA84,"Janet Chandler ""Music/Movie Lover""","[0, 0]","Of all the volumes of DVDs that have been put together from the original ""Twilight Zone"" series volume 43 is a must have for any die hard fan of the series. It features 3 classic episodes from the series and one ok episode. It also features the only time on the series that Rod Serling interacts with the main character in a story which rates as one of the classic moments from the series.The first episode on the DVD is also the first episode to ever appear on the ""Twilight Zone"" titled ""Where Is Everybody?"". It stars Earl Holliman who is the only person to appear in the story until the end. In the story Holliman finds himself in a deserted town. He doesn't know how he got there or what his name is. He slowly starts to remember little things about himself but can he remember everything before he slips into madness? What is interesting about this episode is while it is the first to appear on ""Twilight Zone"" this version of the story was not shown to the public. That is because this version was used to sell the idea of the series to both the television networks and to potential sponcers. As a result there are a couple of differences here. First is Rod Serling does not do the vocal intro to the episode or its ending as would become common in the series. Another person would speak the intro. It wasn't until the series was picked up by CBS that the idea of Serling doing the intros and endings to the stories was suggested. As a side trivia note, During the first season of ""Twilight Zone"" you only heard Rod's voice. Starting with the second season Rod Serling would start to appear at the beginning of each episode. That doesn't mean however you don't see Serling during this program. You do see him at first as he gives an intro describing what the series is about as he is trying to sell it to the television executives. It is certainly interesting to see and hear him talking about this new idea for a television series in hopes of selling it to one of the networks. This episode alone I feel makes this DVD worth five stars.""The Eye Of The Beholder"" is the second offering from the ""Twilight Zone"" on this DVD. This is another one of those classic episodes that was written by Serling. In the story you see a woman but not her face as it is covered completely in bandages. She has a facial deformity and the doctors at the hospital have performed surgery to try to correct this deformity. Through out the episode you also don't see the faces of the doctors or nurses because either the light is very dark or it is hidden by someone or something to not let you see their faces. Not until you get to the end of the story do you get to see everyone's faces and the woman finds to her dismay the surgery didn't work. Trivia note here, while it is not her voice you hear as the woman is talking during the story it is Donna Douglas' face who you see at the end of the story when the bandages come off. She would of course go on to become famous playing Elly Mae on ""The Beverly Hillbillies"".Third story on the disc is the one featuring Rod interacting with the main character in the story. The title is ""A World Of His Own"". In it Keenan Wynn plays Gregory West. A TV writer who doesn't write his scripts but dictates them instead onto a tape recorder. (side note, that is exactly how Rod Serling use to ""write"" his episodes for ""Twilight Zone"" although he did not write this one. This episode was written by Richard Matheson) As Gregory West describes his characters into the recorder the characters come to life as real people just as the way he describes them. One day his wife looks through the window to his office and sees another woman in the room with him. Assuming that he is having an affair with another woman she confronts Gregory about it. He tried to explain to his wife how he can make his characters come to life but of course she wont believe him. I don't want to give too much more here for the benefit of those who have not seen this episode but the interaction between Rod and Gregory takes place at the end when Rod gives his usual closing comments of the story just seen.The last story is ""A Thing About Machines"". It stars Richard Hayden as a man who has issues with modern machines and devices. In a nutshell he hates them. Of course since this IS the ""Twilight Zone"" they hate him back. This is the ok episode I mentioned earlier. The story isn't bad and I do kind of like it but it is I find a tad too predictable episode. Hayden helps to save the episode a bit with his performance. Still this episode doesn't I feel rate as being a classic one compaired to the other three on this DVD.All in all this is a very good volume of the ""Twilight Zone"" to add to your video collection. Especially if you are a fan of this series. For someone who is not familier with the show this volume will make an excellent introduction to the series.",5,A Must Have Volume,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",2014,4874,"['volumes', 'DVDs', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'original', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'series', 'volume', '43', 'must', 'have', 'die', 'hard', 'fan', 'series', '3', 'classic', 'episodes', 'series', 'one', 'ok', 'episode', 'also', 'only', 'time', 'series', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'rates', 'one', 'classic', 'moments', 'series.The', 'first', 'DVD', 'also', 'first', 'episode', 'ever', 'appear', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'titled', 'Where', 'Everybody', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'who', 'only', 'person', 'appear', 'story', 'end', 'story', 'Holliman', 'deserted', 'town', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'what', 'name', 'slowly', 'remember', 'little', 'things', 'can', 'remember', 'everything', 'madness', 'What', 'interesting', 'episode', 'first', 'appear', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'version', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'shown', 'public', 'version', 'was', 'used', 'sell', 'idea', 'series', 'television', 'networks', 'potential', 'sponcers', 'result', 'are', 'couple', 'differences', 'here', 'First', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'not', 'do', 'vocal', 'intro', 'episode', 'ending', 'as', 'would', 'become', 'common', 'series', 'person', 'would', 'speak', 'intro', 'was', ""n't"", 'series', 'was', 'picked', 'up', 'CBS', 'idea', 'Serling', 'doing', 'intros', 'endings', 'stories', 'was', 'suggested', 'side', 'trivia', 'note', 'first', 'season', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'only', 'heard', 'Rod', 'voice', 'Starting', 'second', 'season', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'would', 'start', 'appear', 'beginning', 'episode', ""n't"", 'mean', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Serling', 'program', 'do', 'see', 'first', 'intro', 'describing', 'what', 'series', 'trying', 'sell', 'television', 'executives', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'see', 'hear', 'talking', 'new', 'idea', 'television', 'series', 'hopes', 'selling', 'one', 'networks', 'episode', 'alone', 'feel', 'DVD', 'worth', 'five', 'stars', 'Eye', 'Beholder', 'second', 'offering', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'DVD', 'one', 'classic', 'episodes', 'was', 'written', 'Serling', 'story', 'see', 'woman', 'not', 'face', 'covered', 'completely', 'bandages', 'facial', 'deformity', 'doctors', 'hospital', 'have', 'performed', 'surgery', 'try', 'correct', 'deformity', 'episode', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'light', 'very', 'dark', 'hidden', 'someone', 'something', 'not', 'let', 'see', 'Not', 'get', 'end', 'story', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'everyone', 'woman', 'dismay', 'surgery', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Trivia', 'note', 'here', 'not', 'voice', 'hear', 'woman', 'talking', 'story', 'Donna', 'Douglas', 'face', 'who', 'see', 'end', 'story', 'when', 'bandages', 'come', 'off', 'would', 'course', 'go', 'become', 'famous', 'playing', 'Elly', 'Mae', 'Beverly', 'Hillbillies', '.Third', 'story', 'disc', 'one', 'featuring', 'Rod', 'interacting', 'main', 'character', 'story', 'title', 'A', 'World', 'Own', 'Keenan', 'Wynn', 'Gregory', 'West', 'A', 'TV', 'writer', 'who', ""n't"", 'write', 'scripts', 'instead', 'tape', 'recorder', 'side', 'note', 'exactly', 'how', 'Rod', 'Serling', 'use', 'write', 'episodes', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'did', 'not', 'write', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'written', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'Gregory', 'West', 'characters', 'recorder', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'real', 'people', 'just', 'way', 'One', 'day', 'wife', 'window', 'office', 'woman', 'room', 'Assuming', 'having', 'affair', 'woman', 'Gregory', 'tried', 'explain', 'wife', 'how', 'can', 'make', 'characters', 'come', 'life', 'course', 'wont', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'here', 'benefit', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'episode', 'interaction', 'Rod', 'Gregory', 'place', 'end', 'when', 'Rod', 'usual', 'closing', 'comments', 'story', 'just', 'seen.The', 'last', 'story', 'A', 'Thing', 'Machines', 'Richard', 'Hayden', 'man', 'who', 'issues', 'modern', 'machines', 'devices', 'nutshell', 'course', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'hate', 'back', 'ok', 'episode', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'do', 'kind', 'find', 'tad', 'too', 'predictable', 'episode', 'Hayden', 'save', 'episode', 'bit', 'performance', 'Still', 'episode', ""n't"", 'feel', 'rate', 'being', 'classic', 'one', 'compaired', 'other', 'three', 'DVD.All', 'very', 'good', 'volume', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'add', 'video', 'collection', 'Especially', 'are', 'fan', 'series', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'familier', 'show', 'volume', 'will', 'make', 'excellent', 'introduction', 'series']",N/A

581881,A31QEAZMJWBF28,B00005IA84,NMdesapio,"[16, 16]","Volume 43 in the series of TWILIGHT ZONE DVDs presents two classic episodes and two relative rarities from the series.  The first classic is the pilot episode, ""Where Is Everybody?""  This thirty-minute near-monodrama stars Earl Holliman as a man who inexplicably finds himself in a deserted town.  Who the man is and how he came to be in the town appropriately remains a mystery until the episode's final scene.  ""The Eye of the Beholder,"" a classic from the ZONE's second season, was quite controversial when first shown.  It is the story of a woman, Janet Tyler, who was born with a ""deformed"" face and is undergoing plastic surgery to make her face look ""normal.""  The episode takes place in a dimly lit hospital, and Janet's face, as well as the faces of the doctors and nurses attending her, is not seen until the episode's last moments - which are some of the most shocking and thrilling in ZONE history.Both of the classic episodes were written by Rod Serling, as was ""A Thing about Machines,"" a timely (if somewhat silly) story about a man (Richard Hayden) who comes to a bad end due to his fear of technology.  Richard Matheson's ""A World of His Own,"" one of the ZONE's few comedies, is a delightful gem starring Keenan Wynn as Gregory West, a mild-mannered playwright who brings his characters to life by describing them into a Dictaphone.  In the end, the playwright is granted well-deserved happiness with one of his creations.The reason I give this generally fine disc four stars only is this:  I feel that the presentation of ""Where Is Everybody?"" is marred by its introductory and ending narrations, which are given by an announcer who is not Serling.  Every ZONE fan knows and loves Serling's spoken narrations for the episodes:  his famous opening ones (""There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man...""; ""You're traveling through another dimension...""; ""You unlock this door with the key of imagination..."") and his creative closing ones (""Where Is Everybody""'s begins, ""Up there, up there in the vastness of space"").  The narrations are not the same without Serling's voice - its sound and its memorable, clipped delivery.  There were, in fact, two versions of ""Where Is Everybody?""  It is the first version, which was shown only to the series' prospective sponsors, that is presented here.  The man who read the narrations originally was...well, just not Serling.  This version also has dialogue in the first scene that was edited for the better-known second version - the one seen by the general viewing public.  It is debatable which version of the script is better.
