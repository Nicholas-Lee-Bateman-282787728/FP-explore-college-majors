I watch this show to see the design challenges and then the shows resulting from those challenges.  I am somewhat interested in the personalities on the show but that is a much more distant interest.  There always seems to be one character everyone hates and that was true of this season too.  I think that is just human nature, especially in a competitive setting.  I thought there was a lot of talent on this season.  By the time we got down to the final four contestants, I was having a heck of a time choosing and I usually don't have this much of a problem.  Usually the soon-to-be-winner is standing out by the time we get down to that few.One thing that always bothers me about this show is that there is never any prize for the two runners up.  I think there should be some consolation prizes for them.  Certainly all these companies involved in this show can come up with something for them.  If nothing else, give all three of them a free vacation at a spa so they can recuperate from all that tension and hard work.This is the last season that was shot in New York.  For Season 6, which I am now watching, the show has moved to L.A.I must also say that Heidi Klum continues to irritate me season after season.  I don't know what is so offputting about her but with each season I renew and intensify the feeling that wouldn't it be nice if I never had to hear or see her again.  I do not have that problem with Tim Gunn, Michael Kors or Nina Garcia.  They are fine.",5,I Completely Enjoyed It Plus Was Glad There Was No Reunion,1252195200,"09 6, 2009",2009,1542,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'enjoyed', 'reunion', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'watch', 'show', 'see', 'design', 'challenges', 'then', 'shows', 'resulting', 'challenges', 'am', 'somewhat', 'interested', 'personalities', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'distant', 'interest', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'character', 'everyone', 'hates', 'was', 'true', 'season', 'too', 'think', 'just', 'human', 'nature', 'especially', 'competitive', 'setting', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'talent', 'season', 'time', 'got', 'down', 'final', 'four', 'contestants', 'was', 'having', 'heck', 'time', 'choosing', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'problem', 'Usually', 'soon-to-be-winner', 'standing', 'out', 'time', 'get', 'down', 'few.One', 'thing', 'always', 'show', 'never', 'prize', 'two', 'runners', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'consolation', 'prizes', 'Certainly', 'companies', 'involved', 'show', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'nothing', 'else', 'give', 'three', 'free', 'vacation', 'spa', 'can', 'recuperate', 'tension', 'hard', 'work.This', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'Season', '6', 'am', 'now', 'watching', 'show', 'moved', 'L.A.I', 'must', 'also', 'say', 'Heidi', 'Klum', 'irritate', 'season', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'so', 'offputting', 'season', 'renew', 'intensify', 'feeling', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'nice', 'never', 'had', 'hear', 'see', 'again', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'Tim', 'Gunn', 'Michael', 'Kors', 'Nina', 'Garcia', 'are', 'fine']",Project Runway: Season 5

1255145,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00284G2B2,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 3]","----------------------------------------""Project Runway: Season Five""(Bravo, 2009)----------------------------------------Despite the behind-the-scenes production delays and legal wranglings, Season Five of ""Project Runway"" emerges as one of the strongest shows to date, perhaps rivaling Season One in terms of its narrative arc.  The season starts off slow, with a cast packed with the usual mix of narcissism, talent and self-delusion, but as the season progresses many, if not all, of the unlikeable contestants wind up seeming pretty sympathetic. It's not clear that the raw talent or wow factor is as widespread this time around, but the winning designer's runway show is breathtaking, and really feels like a world-class fashion production. There do seem to be a lot of questionable calls on the judges' parts -- sometimes I found myself wondering if they were tailoring their decisions more for the drama of the series, rather than for pure fashion. (Really?  You like those drapey, flowy things that much? Hmmm.) Also, I think their decision on the elimination from five to four contestants was just utterly wrong: the rock'n'roll outfit was exactly, spot-on perfect, and way better than the other designs. Oh, well. Poor guy.)Anyway, it was a fun season, and fans of Tim Gunn should be especially pleased with how much more of his persona comes through.  Looking forward to Season Six!

Heidi is devine (""She acts kind of bitchy, no?"") and Tim Gunn (""Make it work"") are such fun!  Then add to this mix the judges, designers and the crazy challanges (can YOU make an outfit out of a garbage bag?) and you have a show that you just can't miss!  I LOVE THIS!  Season Five was not a disappointment, either.  It delivered the goods!  Lots of excitement and watching your favorite designer get voted off, or one who SHOULD get the boot but stays...well, it's DRAMA plain and simple!

I also agree with one of the reviewers that criticized Tim Gunn as a judge in the final runway show, couldn't they just choose one of the winners from the previous seasons, like Christian? He is the mentor and taskmaster, now he has to fill in as a judge also?  Season 5 contestants are an interesting mix, but I can think about some past seasons as a bit more sophisticated. Also you could guess who would be the winner, if you watch the show from the beginning, so there is less suspense compared to previous seasons. I watched all the seasons, I definitely hope the later seasons on Lifetime would be getting better. Project Runway is still one of the best reality shows on TV.
