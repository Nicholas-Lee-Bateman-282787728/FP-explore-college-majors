In his early live, he had been picked on by bullies because of his mother's nationality so, like Forrest Gump, he had to learn to run fast from those crass youngsters.  When he finished high school, he was courted by several universities but chose to stay in his home state to be trained by Bill Bowerman at the University of Oregon.Steve was a go-getter who really didn't know his place and was unsophiscated, not knowing how to pace himself.  Word of talent gets around and the athletes stick together.  He is told by his coach that it takes eight percent more energy to be a leader than a follower.  Steve always wanted to lead the pack and be out front.  Bowerman thought  he was a god.One song fit in with the action, the Barry White sexy talking, when he hurts his foot in a very strange way.  He resorts to telling lies about exactly how he hurt it.  Female can be an athlete's downfall, but Steve was unconcerned and had a determination to win at any cost.  It was a likely story, and sometimes he had to admit that ""it wasn't a nice thing to do.""He was able to run in the 1972 Olympics in Munich after graduating from high school in 1969.

107020,ACC1SLND21RI6,0790739283,Breyel,"[9, 10]","""Without Limits"" is a biopic about America's great middle distance runner in the 2,000 to 10,000 metre events, the late Pete Prefontaine (Billy Crudup), as told through his coach and mentor Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland). The film takes us back to the late 1960's and early 1970's when `Pre' set many firsts, on and off the track.The film attempts to explain his compulsion for excellence. It introduces us to his high school exploits, highlights some of his races and records set while at the University of Oregon and his 1972 Olympic bid in Munich. We see Bowerman and Pre at odds over strategy and technique, but growing in respect and admiration of one another. The film also underscores Pre's disgust with the obsolete policies of America's Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and the International Olympic Committee. There are also scenes with contemporaries Lassi Veron and Frank Shorter. Pre's girlfriend (Monica Potter), dalliances and flirtations with the ladies at the University of Oregon are woven into the story as well.More than a biopic, ""Without Limits"" is a film about the will to win, to be the best, to give one's all, whether it be in sports or any of life's countless trials. While some may consider Pre high spirited and arrogant, it was his conviction to never compromise on excellence that drove him to push the limits. And that's what the film explores. Pre was an inspiration, and I hope those who watch this film will be equally driven to excel, just as he did.He was certainly one of my heroes. And I am only too delighted to recommend this film. It's immensely satisfying to see director Robert Towne and co-writer Kenny Moore author ofBowerman and the Men of Oregon: The Story of Oregon's Legendary Coach and Nike's Cofounder(Pre's friend and former world-class runner) consider him great enough to merit this biopic. The track-savvy authenticity and love of the man is deeply reflected in this moving story.Thanks also to the incredibly believable performances of Donald Sutherland and Billy Crudup, the film rises triumphantly and honours not only Pre, but Bowerman as well.

However, because it does not have the traditional happy ending that seems to be required of sports movies, it received very little notice.  That's unfortunate because in addition to containing an Oscar-calliber  performance from Donald Sutherland, the rest of the acting and direction  are absolutely first rate.  Robert Towne captures the essence of the great  Prefontaine through the being of Billy Crudup.  The race scenes are simply  breathtaking.  Prefontaine comes off as a real person, with all of his  virtues and faults, rather than some mythical presence.  Even the love  story rings absolutely true instead of being an unreal fable.

107025,A3DSTOJPRMV674,0790739283,"Chris K. Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[9, 9]","It's really a shame that director Robert Towne's 1999 film ""Without Limits"" was not seen by a larger audience. This is an inspirational tribute to the all-too-short life of long distance runner Steve Prefontaine. It is also an admirable film detailing the sport of track and field and the unique athletes who participate in it. There are moments when ""Without Limits"" is far too conventional, especially when dealing with Prefontaine's depression after the 1972 Munich Olympics. But this is a difficult story to tell, and Towne has done an expert job in weaving Prefontaine's life around the ultimate, bittersweet highlight of his career - his heroic and memorable race at the Olympics.Having seen both films about this subject released in the same year (""Prefontaine"" starring Jared Leto was released before ""Without Limits""), I can comfortably say Towne's version is a better realized, more innovative work. The editing and direction during the Olympic race is terrifically exciting, and properly captures the warrior-like nature Prefontaine displayed in that symbolic moment. The scene, which arrives about three-quarters of the way in, will raise goosebumps on your flesh. The filmmaking innovations involved, in which the race becomes as exciting a battle as anything seen in ""Rocky,"" is a tribute to the talents of Towne. He knew what parts of that race needed to be emphasized, just as he knew why it was such a spectacular effort by Prefontaine. Towne's gone on record, of course, as being a huge track and field fan, and his overrated 1982 film ""Personal Best"" was another fine salute to the sport.One cannot give enough praise to the performances of Billy Crudup as Prefontaine and Donald Sutherland as his mentor/coach Bill Bowerman (who would go on the create Nike shoes). They bond, forming a father-son relationship that is equally touching and gentle. Their repartee, when Prefontaine first arrives on the University of Oregon campus during the 1960s as a cocky and brash track athlete, is an additional highlight.In many ways, Prefontaine's interesting life has been simplified by Towne and co-screenwriter Kenny Moore, if only because so much of the man's life was unrealized. Prefontaine's tragic death is haunting because unlimited promise was yet on the horizon for this uniquely American athlete. But Prefontaine's spirit, which inspires people to this very day, and perhaps will forever, has been properly captured in ""Without Limits."" And that is why this film is an unqualified success.",4,Inspirational tribute to Steve Prefontaine,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,2510,"['really', 'shame', 'director', 'Robert', 'Towne', '1999', 'film', 'Limits', 'was', 'not', 'seen', 'larger', 'audience', 'inspirational', 'tribute', 'all-too-short', 'life', 'long', 'distance', 'runner', 'Steve', 'Prefontaine', 'also', 'admirable', 'film', 'detailing', 'sport', 'track', 'field', 'unique', 'athletes', 'who', 'participate', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'Limits', 'far', 'too', 'conventional', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'Prefontaine', 'depression', '1972', 'Munich', 'Olympics', 'difficult', 'story', 'tell', 'Towne', 'done', 'expert', 'job', 'weaving', 'Prefontaine', 'life', 'ultimate', 'bittersweet', 'highlight', 'career', 'heroic', 'memorable', 'race', 'Olympics.Having', 'seen', 'films', 'subject', 'released', 'same', 'year', 'Prefontaine', 'starring', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'was', 'released', 'Limits', 'can', 'comfortably', 'say', 'Towne', 'version', 'better', 'realized', 'more', 'innovative', 'work', 'editing', 'direction', 'Olympic', 'race', 'terrifically', 'exciting', 'properly', 'warrior-like', 'nature', 'Prefontaine', 'displayed', 'symbolic', 'moment', 'scene', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'will', 'raise', 'goosebumps', 'flesh', 'filmmaking', 'innovations', 'involved', 'race', 'exciting', 'battle', 'anything', 'seen', 'Rocky', 'tribute', 'talents', 'Towne', 'knew', 'what', 'parts', 'race', 'needed', 'be', 'emphasized', 'just', 'knew', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'spectacular', 'effort', 'Prefontaine', 'Towne', 'gone', 'record', 'course', 'being', 'huge', 'track', 'field', 'fan', 'overrated', '1982', 'film', 'Personal', 'Best', 'was', 'fine', 'salute', 'sport.One', 'can', 'not', 'give', 'enough', 'praise', 'performances', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'Prefontaine', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'mentor/coach', 'Bill', 'Bowerman', 'who', 'would', 'go', 'create', 'Nike', 'shoes', 'bond', 'forming', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'equally', 'touching', 'gentle', 'repartee', 'when', 'Prefontaine', 'first', 'University', 'Oregon', 'campus', '1960s', 'cocky', 'brash', 'track', 'athlete', 'additional', 'highlight.In', 'many', 'ways', 'Prefontaine', 'interesting', 'life', 'been', 'simplified', 'Towne', 'co-screenwriter', 'Kenny', 'Moore', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'man', 'life', 'was', 'unrealized', 'Prefontaine', 'tragic', 'death', 'haunting', 'unlimited', 'promise', 'was', 'yet', 'horizon', 'uniquely', 'American', 'athlete', 'Prefontaine', 'spirit', 'people', 'very', 'day', 'perhaps', 'will', 'forever', 'been', 'properly', 'captured', 'Limits', 'why', 'film', 'unqualified', 'success']",N/A
107026,AUHG8KSHI529U,0790739283,Craig Matteson,"[8, 8]","Steve Prefontaine, a record setting middle distance runner, won all his races against Americans.  He led his race in the 1972 Olympics but faded to fourth by a breath.  He died in a car accident (drinking was involved, but to what degree is debated) in 1975 at the age of 24.  All admit that he wasn't the perfect physical specimen for a runner, but he was gritty and tenacious and would not give anything less than everything he had.You would think it would be hard to come up with a full length bio pic about someone who died at 24.  Yet, in 1998 there were TWO films that came out about his life.  One from Disney and the other from Warner Brothers.The Disney Film tells the story from the point of view of the assistant coach who was with him day-to-day, Bill Dellinger and Prefontaine's girlfriend at the time of his death, Nancy Alleman.  It has a good cast with Jared Leto as Prefontaine, Ed O'Neil as Bill Dellinger and R. Lee Ermy as Bill Bowerman.  Siskel and Ebert reviewed it and gave it two thumbs up.The Warner Brothers release was produced by Tom Cruise and told from the point of view of Bill Bowerman with Dellinger as a minor character and Mary Marckx.  In this film there is no Nancy Alleman and Mary is his girlfriend all the way through.  Bowerman is played by Donald Sutherland and is given guru status.  In both films, Prefontaine is shown as headstrong and difficult to coach.  Bowerman did remain active with the Oregon program and with Prefontaine after his retirement.In both films, Prefontaine is shown as a powerful and hard charging runner who also loved to party too much and had troubled relationships with his young women.  The fans love him and his fame is correctly portrayed as is his loss at the '72 Olympics.Since the accident occurred while Prefontaine was alone in the car no one can be certain how it happened.  Both films have him swerving from a second car, but the Warner film shows the rock face that the car climbed and caused it to flip on top of the runner and crushing him.  He was alive when first found, but the person could not flip the car alone and by the time they got back he was gone.Prefontaine continues to inspire young runners and people who believe that testing your limits and giving all you have is important to living and understanding your life.  That these tests are a kind of art that you create for yourself and are a kind of honesty that few actually experience (even though it is open to all).Both movies are good, and you have to decide if seeing two films about such a short life is needed, but there is certainly much worse fare shown every night on TV and at your local movie house.",4,A very good bio pick of a great runner who died too young,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,2657,"['Steve', 'Prefontaine', 'record', 'setting', 'middle', 'distance', 'runner', 'won', 'races', 'Americans', 'led', 'race', '1972', 'Olympics', 'faded', 'fourth', 'breath', 'died', 'car', 'accident', 'drinking', 'was', 'involved', 'what', 'degree', 'debated', '1975', 'age', '24', 'admit', 'was', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'physical', 'specimen', 'runner', 'was', 'gritty', 'tenacious', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'anything', 'less', 'everything', 'had.You', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'full', 'length', 'bio', 'pic', 'someone', 'who', 'died', '24', '1998', 'were', 'TWO', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'life', 'One', 'Disney', 'other', 'Warner', 'Brothers.The', 'Disney', 'Film', 'story', 'point', 'view', 'assistant', 'coach', 'who', 'was', 'day-to-day', 'Bill', 'Dellinger', 'Prefontaine', 'girlfriend', 'time', 'death', 'Nancy', 'Alleman', 'good', 'cast', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Prefontaine', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", 'Bill', 'Dellinger', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermy', 'Bill', 'Bowerman', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'reviewed', 'gave', 'two', 'up.The', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'release', 'was', 'produced', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Bill', 'Bowerman', 'Dellinger', 'minor', 'character', 'Mary', 'Marckx', 'film', 'Nancy', 'Alleman', 'Mary', 'girlfriend', 'way', 'Bowerman', 'played', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'given', 'guru', 'status', 'films', 'Prefontaine', 'shown', 'headstrong', 'difficult', 'coach', 'Bowerman', 'did', 'remain', 'active', 'Oregon', 'program', 'Prefontaine', 'retirement.In', 'films', 'Prefontaine', 'shown', 'powerful', 'hard', 'charging', 'runner', 'who', 'also', 'loved', 'party', 'too', 'much', 'had', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'young', 'women', 'fans', 'love', 'fame', 'correctly', 'portrayed', 'loss', ""'72"", 'Olympics.Since', 'accident', 'occurred', 'Prefontaine', 'was', 'alone', 'car', 'one', 'can', 'be', 'certain', 'how', 'happened', 'films', 'have', 'swerving', 'second', 'car', 'Warner', 'film', 'rock', 'face', 'car', 'climbed', 'caused', 'flip', 'top', 'runner', 'crushing', 'was', 'alive', 'when', 'first', 'found', 'person', 'could', 'not', 'flip', 'car', 'alone', 'time', 'got', 'back', 'was', 'gone.Prefontaine', 'inspire', 'young', 'runners', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'testing', 'limits', 'giving', 'have', 'important', 'living', 'understanding', 'life', 'tests', 'are', 'kind', 'art', 'create', 'are', 'kind', 'honesty', 'few', 'actually', 'experience', 'even', 'open', 'movies', 'are', 'good', 'have', 'decide', 'seeing', 'two', 'films', 'short', 'life', 'needed', 'certainly', 'much', 'worse', 'fare', 'shown', 'night', 'TV', 'local', 'movie', 'house']",N/A
107027,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,0790739283,Daniel Hurley,"[7, 8]","Great capture of Pre but also of Bill Bowerman along with the portrayal of runners of that great era. Billy Crudrup (Crudrup actually could run 27 seconds in the 200 meters)some how captures Pre's unique and hard to emulate running style very well along with capturing the unique boldness of his character with a brashness that was more disarming than obnoxious. The film captures Pre's early days in Coos Bay along with his HS period highlighted by Asst. Coach Dellinger's visit with top Oregon runners in tow. Pre, in a pouring rain, takes the established Duck runners on an aggressive run through the woods frequently asking if the pace is too fast. Most impressive is Sutherland's capture of the great innovative and serious coach Bill Bowerman who created a special track dynasty at Oregon. The nuances of the film are excellent such as the great American distance runner in his own right Pat Porter playing the running role of the Fin Lasse Viren. In addition, the actors playing the famous runners such as Mohammed Gammoudi, capture the running styles of those athletes extraordinary well including actor Sol Alexis looking identically like the fleet German Harold Norpoth. In addition, the dialogue of the British commentators in the movie actually matches the commentary made during the actual telecast of the Munich 5000 with references to Pre being a 'cocky American"" and an ""American Beatle"". The only thing missing from the film, are some of Pre's trials outside of Munich such as his great cross-country race against Brit Nick Rose in his final NCAA cross-country race and his upset by Dick Burkle indoors, the latter being a great American awakening. In addition, Pre was challenged his final years by another great Duck who frequently pushed Pre to the line, Paul Geis. I think these later battles would make Pre more mortal but on the other hand, demonstrate his ability to deal with adversity while also showing the strength of American distance running showcased by the oft forgotten fact that marathoner Frank Shorter surprisingly led Pre during the final 200 of their great 74 5000 in Eugene.  Actually clips from that great Munich 5000 are actually threaded into that terrific portrayal of the fantastic race where Pre goes for in the last mile and makes that dramatic burst all or nothing go for the gold with 300 meters to go that costs him a certain medal as it is still agonizing to watch his final 30 meters where Pre's body shuts down as cocky Brit Ian Stewart zooms past for the bronze.

I am a distance runner from Oregon.  Thus, the legend of Pre is alive and kicking from where I am from.  I read his biography as a high school runner and admired his dedication and commitment to a sport I was only just being introduced.  Moreover, I have been to Eugene many times, run on ""the track,"" and seen the spot of his untimely death.  This film is an inspiring film; if you are a runner, you must see it.  It will make you want to get up off the couch and go for an easy ten.The acting in this film is better than in ""Prefontaine,"" the other film documenting Pre's life produced a year before this film came out.  Donald Sutherland's performance as Bill Bowerman is extremely moving and endearing.  His connection with Pre is that of a father to a son.  As far as historical accuracy, many will quibble about the details of Pre's life and relationships, but I am not overly concerned by this fact.  As in literature, it is not the job of an author to necessarily render everything according to historical accuracy.  Rather, he or she must create memorable characters that move and affect us.  This film achieves just that.While its interest will definitely appeal to those of the athletic (and, in particular, running) community, I believe that its message has a more universal appeal as well.  Pre set out to conquer the world and ended up finally conquering himself and coming to peace with that fact.

Since I  attended Prefontaine's high school a number of years later, I met him my  first week of school, I ran long distance and even posted faster two-mile  times then Pre as a freshman and sophomore, and I was in the Marshfield  stadium when his running colleagues carried the coffin onto the field for a  memorial service before the body was taken to its final resting place south  of town, I fight to retain some objectivity myself.&quot;Without  Limits&quot; is coach Bill Bowerman's, fellow runner Kenny Moore's, and a  particular Pre girlfriend's version of the story, gussied up by  screenwriter Robert Towne.

They're just different approaches to  the same basic story ... and probably equally wrong in many of the details.  (Prefontaine's parents were in on the earlier film, and supplied the makers  with actual home movie footage of Pre as a child.)I'm delighted that any  film got made about this man, let alone two; I'm gratified if either movie  has served to inspire younger runners; but I think it's ridiculous to argue  that one or the other &quot;really&quot; captures the man.

This film dramatized the life of Steve  Prefontaine, a pre-eminent U.S. distance runner in the 1970's.Though  some of the details of his life were fudged for dramatic purposes, the  essence of Prefontaine was preserved, namely his brash egotistical style of  running and living.  In addition to its realism regarding the sequences  filmed on the track, this film gives a good account of the psychology of  running.Robert Towne did a fabulous job overall with this film, but  especially with the realism of the scenes on the track.  The dramatic  element, focusing on character development of Prefontaine as a person as  well as a runner was also well done, elevating it above your typical sports  documentary and improving its entertainment value.Billy Crudup gives a  fine performance as Pre.  He captures the arrogance and the crushing  disappointment of his life.  He was also terrific in the running scenes.Donald Sutherland was also great as Coach Bill Bowerman.

Although it may be more appealing to the masses, I think the movie &quot;Prefontaine&quot; does a better job of getting us inside the mind of the runner Pre.This movie does have some realistic running settings early on. I was disappointed when they did not continue. For example, many cross-country runners, like myself, who have charged down the first quarter mile of a grassy slope with 200+ others (like the opening of this movie) can often tell you how it is like a horse stampede (not a cow stampede, they are too slow). In real life the volume level can be staggering (much louder than the soundtrack), but the movie does a good job of trying to present that realistically. There are other similar cases of realism, but they really get spread thin after the opening.The movie jumps around quite a bit, not really developing any part of it very well. In some ways, this may be like life, but few of us want to see it that way -- a two hour movie should be more enveloping. I did not feel like I got to know any of the people very well. Donald Sutherland does a very good job as coach and the coach may be the only one who's character gets developed more than in &quot;Prefontaine&quot;.The closing scene of &quot;Prefontaine&quot; was much more moving than &quot;Without Limits&quot;.

Quite frankly, &quot;Without Limits&quot; was slightly disappointing for me, simply because I was left with too many questions as to what the writers were trying to get across.First of all, there is Pre's relationship with Mary Marckx. I kept wondering what Pre found intriguing about her. She's a great character and I liked her a lot, but her place in the film is not well-defined, as she sort of floats in and out of the plot. Pre did not really pursue Mary in the grand scheme of the film either, since, in between tete-a-tetes with Mary, Pre apparently has all sorts of flings. Given this lack of attention to her (except that he thinks about her a lot) it would have been good to have focused a bit more on who Mary was to Pre, exactly.Secondly, Pre's famous and refreshingly tenacious bone-picking of the AAU is only given a back seat in the film. I thought this was a bit strange, considering that the AAU fight was a big part of Pre's life. Even stranger was the fact that any coverage beyond a mention of Pre's last race was skipped completely, in spite of its being very important to his career. Not only was it one of his fastest races, but it probably would have never happened had Pre not pursued the AAU.I thought the Pre-Bowerman aspect of the film was interesting because it let the viewers see something of what went on between what was undeniably a great matching of coach and student. Bowerman was a powerful influence on Pre. For one thing, he helped Steve hone his running style and he taught him discipline. For another, Steve met his match, mentally and emotionally. I enjoyed seeing their interaction with each other. Bowerman and Pre's post-college relationship could have gotten a bit more detail, even though, on the other hand, it would have been a nice little plug for Nike.This was a good film, but I don't think it presented as fleshy a portrait of Steve Prefontaine as it could have.

All of the acting is superb, especially Crudup and Sutherland.  The scene in which Pre blatantly ignores Bowerman's mandate to sit back during most of the race and let the front runner wear himself out is especially good.  It's funny, revealing of both characters, and just has that right level of inspiration (you can ignore the rules and win out of sheer guts) without being sappy.I've seen ""Prefontaine,"" the other movie about Pre's life, and I can't say that I was impressed.  Some reviewers claim that it is more factual.  Perhaps that is the case, but ""Prefontaine"" is not a well made movie.  It also takes on extra baggage that distracts from the story.  For example, in one scene they show Pre making snide comments about anti-war protesters.  Was Pre a hawk?  Did he ever express an opinion about war?  I have no idea.  But as a college athlete it would have been exceptionally hypocritical to have such an opinion when his status as an athlete allowed him to stay out of the military.""Without LImits"" doesn't get bogged down in these unimportant side issues.  Instead, it focuses on Pre's fight against the AAU, the governing track and field organization which was so obviously taking advantage of athletes at the time.Prefontaine once said, ""Most people run a race to see who is fastest. I run a race to see who has the most guts.""  That about sums up the spirit of this movie.While the movie is great, the DVD is nothing special.  I can't figure out why movie studios make great movies like this and then slap them on a DVD with ""extras"" that include sub-titles at that's it.  If there was ever a DVD that should have had extras this one was it - short documentaries on the real Prefontaine, how the movie was filmed, interviews with people who knew Pre, those who were fans at the time, archival footage.

On the other hand, some would say there's all the difference in the world.Steve Prefontaine (played by Billy Crudup), was a distance runner in Eugene, Oregon with scholarship offers from Yale, Brown, Villanova, Princeton and Nebraska. The one school he wishes to attend, however, has remained silent. Two distance runners from the school and its assistant coach make a personal visit to his home but Prefontaine (Crudup) is not impressed. In the less-than-three week period between that visit and the date when he must sign his letter of intent, Bill Bowerman, head coach of the University of Oregon track team, sends a genuine plea to young Prefontaine asking him to attend. On his first day, he shows an amazing inability to notice the obvious by asking a female student, Mary Marckx (played by Monica Potter) to direct him to an area that is clearly visible ahead of him. He enters the building and sees a long line of fellow team members who recount tall tales of Bowerman's exploits in the military. He is summoned from another room and, on the floor in front of him, he finds his head coach. Bowerman (played and earlier voiced by Donald Sutherland) is making outlines of his runners' feet on tracing paper for the purposes of making shoes specifically for them, explaining that taking an ounce off a runner's shoe amounts to pounds they won't have to carry during a race. The freshman athlete sarcastically compliments him and that is the end of their first interaction. The next day, during a simple workout, Steve gives one hundred percent, finishes ahead of his teammates, and, according to Bowerman, with a pulse rate north of one hundred and ninety. So begins the struggle that would define their relationship: a coach's desire to instruct and an athlete's desire to put forth his best effort, regardless of the consequences.Much has been made of the fact that Without Limits and Prefontaine, a Disney film covering the same subject matter from a different perspective, were released within months of each other. The general consensus seems to be that, while Prefontaine is more accurate, Without Limits is the better film. As I have not seen the former from beginning to end, all I can tell you is that Without Limits is a masterpiece. Sutherland is mesmerizing as Bill Bowerman and Crudup, in the first role I ever saw him play, is just as entertaining, if not more so. The conflict between them rings true and while you understand the position of the coach, you root for the runner who seeks to leave the field knowing he's done his best.

The movie follows Prefontaine (Billy Crudup) from his high school days in Coos Bay, Oregon to his recruitment at the University of Oregon in Eugene by legendary track coach Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland).  WITHOUT LIMITS focuses on the relationship between the track star and his legendary coach from their first meeting, through their years together preparing for the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Prefontaine's decline, and his gradual emergence as a powerful long distance contender and initial preparation for the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.  The movie also has a subplot about Prefontaine's relationship with Mary Marckx (Monica Potter).The overall plotting of WITHOUT LIMITS follows the basic structure of a sports biopic and does a good job at telling the story.  Steve Prefontaine lived an interesting life and anyone who is interested in learning more about the man would probably enjoy and benefit from watching the film.  Yet, even though the movie follows the basic structure of a sports biopic, it is much better than most pictures in the genre for two reasons.The first is the acting.  Billy Crudup was cast as Prefontaine because of the similarities between himself and producer Tom Cruise.  However, unlike Cruise, Crudup actually shows more than a semblance of acting talent.  He actually has the goods.  Monica Potter is adorable as Prefontaine's focal love interest in the movie, Mary Marckx.  Matthew Lillard has a small but well-developed role as one of Prefontaine's running mates, Roscoe Devine.  And last but not least is Donald Sutherland giving one of the finer performances in his career portraying legendary track coach and eventual Nike founder, Bill Bowerman.The second thing that makes WITHOUT LIMITS stand out above other sport biopics is the cinematography.  Prefontaine grew up in the beautiful state of Oregon.  The filmmakers took advantage of that fact and filmed most of the location shots in Oregon. This allowed the spectacular scenery to make up for slow points in the story.  For example, there are a few times in the movie where a scene is just a montage of Prefontaine running.  The location and setting takes those shots and augments them from something ordinary into a pictured sequence of art.WITHOUT LIMITS is a great film to watch if you enjoy running and or have an interest in Prefontaine.  It's also a just a great movie in general.The DVD only features some brief written tidbits about the cast and crew and a trailer.",4,"""It's the hardest thing in the world to believe in something, if you do it's a miracle.""",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,2580,"['LIMITS', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'biopic', 'great', 'American', 'long', 'distance', 'runner', 'Steve', 'Prefontaine', 'movie', 'Prefontaine', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'Coos', 'Bay', 'Oregon', 'recruitment', 'University', 'Oregon', 'Eugene', 'legendary', 'track', 'coach', 'Bill', 'Bowerman', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'LIMITS', 'relationship', 'track', 'star', 'legendary', 'coach', 'first', 'meeting', 'years', 'together', 'preparing', '1972', 'Olympics', 'Munich', 'Prefontaine', 'decline', 'gradual', 'emergence', 'powerful', 'long', 'distance', 'contender', 'initial', 'preparation', '1976', 'Olympics', 'Montreal', 'movie', 'also', 'subplot', 'Prefontaine', 'relationship', 'Mary', 'Marckx', 'Monica', 'Potter', '.The', 'overall', 'plotting', 'WITHOUT', 'LIMITS', 'basic', 'structure', 'sports', 'biopic', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'story', 'Steve', 'Prefontaine', 'lived', 'interesting', 'life', 'anyone', 'who', 'interested', 'learning', 'more', 'man', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'benefit', 'watching', 'film', 'even', 'movie', 'basic', 'structure', 'sports', 'biopic', 'much', 'better', 'most', 'pictures', 'genre', 'two', 'reasons.The', 'first', 'acting', 'Billy', 'Crudup', 'was', 'cast', 'Prefontaine', 'similarities', 'producer', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'However', 'Cruise', 'Crudup', 'actually', 'more', 'semblance', 'acting', 'talent', 'actually', 'goods', 'Monica', 'Potter', 'adorable', 'Prefontaine', 'focal', 'love', 'interest', 'movie', 'Mary', 'Marckx', 'Matthew', 'Lillard', 'small', 'well-developed', 'role', 'one', 'Prefontaine', 'running', 'mates', 'Roscoe', 'Devine', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'Donald', 'Sutherland', 'giving', 'one', 'finer', 'performances', 'career', 'portraying', 'legendary', 'track', 'coach', 'eventual', 'Nike', 'founder', 'Bill', 'Bowerman.The', 'second', 'thing', 'WITHOUT', 'LIMITS', 'stand', 'out', 'other', 'sport', 'biopics', 'cinematography', 'Prefontaine', 'grew', 'up', 'beautiful', 'state', 'Oregon', 'filmmakers', 'took', 'advantage', 'fact', 'filmed', 'most', 'location', 'shots', 'Oregon', 'allowed', 'spectacular', 'scenery', 'make', 'up', 'slow', 'points', 'story', 'example', 'are', 'few', 'times', 'movie', 'where', 'scene', 'just', 'montage', 'Prefontaine', 'running', 'location', 'setting', 'shots', 'augments', 'something', 'ordinary', 'pictured', 'sequence', 'art.WITHOUT', 'LIMITS', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'running', 'have', 'interest', 'Prefontaine', 'also', 'just', 'great', 'movie', 'general.The', 'DVD', 'only', 'brief', 'written', 'tidbits', 'cast', 'crew', 'trailer']",N/A
