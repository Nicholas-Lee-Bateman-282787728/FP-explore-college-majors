Opening the case reveals four discs in black paper sleeves, which are secured under plastic tabs.  Not very sturdy or snazzy.That being said, on to about the show.  Hawkeye is based on &#34;The Last of the Mohicans,&#34; which was written somewhere in the late 1700's or early 1800's.  It follows the life of a Christian man named Nathaniel Bumpo, called Hawkeye, who is literally straight as an arrow.  He doesn't lie, he doesn't cheat, etc.  He is Superman without the cape or the invincibility.Lee Horsely and Lynda Carter (of Wonder Woman fame) co-star and have a fair supporting cast, some better than others.Lynda Carter plays Elizabeth Shields, the wife of the fort's new trading post proprietor.  She turns more and more to Hawkeye when she needs help, finding him by far the most trustworthy of her available options, but neither of them can act on their growing emotional attachment because they have no proof she's a widow.I wouldn't recommend this for very young children because it has so many mature themes.  While I fast-forward with great proficiency, there are still things such as a childbirth scene, military interrogations that stoop to beatings and torture, a peeping tom who gives (me at least) the creeps...There are also a lot of fascinating moments.  At times it's like watching history re-enacted between the British and French military troops.  And then there is a simple wisdom, almost a dignity that makes the show what it is.&#34;What did your bearings look like?&#34; Hawkeye asked Elizabeth.Confused and still lost, Elizabeth admitted, &#34;I'm not sure.&#34;&#34;Then it would be hard to find them,&#34; Hawkeye pointed out the obvious.",4,"""My parents taught me one plain, simple rule.

It was broadcasted (in Madison, WI) every weekend during the first initial run.It captured your attention almost immediately (if this was your type of program).I don't recall any of the episodes as boring - just simple family-oriented entertainment, like Daniel Boone in the early days of TV.However, this DVD release is by Mill Creek (one of those budget type, operated out of someones basement distributors like MPI, Ovation, Platinum - or the worst of the bunch, GoodTimes Home Video).The source for the programs here were taken directly from the feed tapes, not any type of master tapes.Feed tapes are what we used to take the feed from the satellite transponders each week.When the program is sent over the satellite for a station to record it, it comes complete with built in commercial breaks from the program distributors and :12 second or :62 second (etc.) holes for the local station to insert their commercial breaks, then re-cue the program tapes while in commercial break, etc.(People with big 10 foot plus satellite dishes in the back-yard know exactly what I just typed - as the feeds are usually not scrambled and can be viewed / recorded by any of those equipment owners as long as they know where and when to find the feed.)During these feeds, most programs also have ""bumpers"" edited in - those little :03 second or :05 second video / audio segments that give the name of the program, then boom... it's over, and local commercials air.Feed tapes are used, reused, and used again until they contain a lot of bad spots / drop-outs, then tossed.The 1-inch, 3/4 inch or 1/2 inch tape used in broadcasting was usually ten times or more expensive than what you used to pay for blank beta or VHS tapes for home use, so you can only imagine the huge budget for tapes at a TV station - plus the cost of the equipment used to air a program in those days of analog broadcast standards.While watching the DVD's, I noticed the smear (or fuzzy look) of the picture, especially in the graphics (first clue).Also, when the show would fade out at the end of a segment, just before it would fade in for the next segment - a blip would come on the screen.It caught my attention enough to slo-mo the video, and alas! - a single frame or more of a ""bumper"" where it once was in the original satellite feed (second clue).There were many more clues (to a person like me who worked in the business) but I've offered enough for you to draw your own conclusion.To me, it looks like I took the feed tapes home and saved them until I could find a way to market the show, then hooked up a DVD recorder and transferred the program to DVD.Also in my opinion, like so many before, it could also mean that Mill Creek didn't get the proper licensing to distribute this show properly (or perhaps legally) in the USA, Canada or wherever.The show was sold cheap as a DVD set to begin with (around $15 retail), and has since dropped to half or less.I don't know if that's a sign of people who didn't see this show when it first aired due to limited broadcasts in cities around the country like the beginning of Forever Knight (that took another year to grow into a ""cult"" following) or what, but for those of us who love the show and the work of Lee Horsley, Lynda Carter and Rodney A. Grant, this Mill Creek release is a low-budget, low-quality joke.For that reason alone - if you must have it, please ONLY buy it from Amazon marketplace or somewhere (USED) to prevent the distributor from making money for the (lazy or lousy or money-making scheme) release of this program.Hopefully, our voices will be heard by Rhino or Anchor Bay, firms who started in a basement, but payed attention to the voices of those who demand (some) quality... and came through by reinvesting and reinventing the company and began to reissue movies and music with quality.",1,Read this before you

It follows the main character, Natty Bumppo, his Native American companion Chingachgook, trading post owner Elizabeth Shields, and others persons stationed at or living in the vicinity of Fort Bennington.Main castLee Horsley as Hawkeye (Natty Bumppo)Lynda Carter as Elizabeth ShieldsRodney A.

1408494,A2DMEQZ2TTGZ34,B004HHX9T6,A. parry,"[2, 2]","""Hawkeye"" is an early 90's production, 22 episode series, which uses a 1750's time setting in the North American frontier. The primary groups of persons illustrated in this series include the British, French, Huron and Delaware Indians, and a small number of transplanted colonists. There are many reviews already on the Amazon site clearly detailing the intricate storyline, so I will refrain from simply ""re-hashing"" what has already been effectively explained. The title character of ""Hawkeye"" is perfectly played by Lee Horsley, with Lynda Carter playing the primary female lead. Rodney A. Grant, who was spectacular in ""Dances With Wolves"", very effectively portrays Hawkeye's close friend, and occasional life saver, ""Chingachgook"", a Delaware Indian. There are a handful of other acting ""regulars"" who remain in the majority of the episode stories, and they are all wonderful. The scenic filming locations, realistic fort sets, period costumes, military equipment props, etc, are all spectacular in quality. It is very refreshing to watch a show produced like this, without the easy aid of CGI (which would surely be used if a similar production were made in current times). This show is certainly entertaining, as well as being family friendly, and it's definitely worthy of more than one viewing. Most persons could watch this complete series every other year and still enjoy it.My ""5-Star"" rating is for the show ""Hawkeye"" itself, and not the DVD release. To the best of my knowledge, the Mill Creek DVD release has been the only one so far, and may be the only one available for quite some time to come. Given that, I suppose, that we should appreciate the fact that it's available at all, and enjoy it for what it is. For either side of 10 dollars, you can purchase this complete 4 disc set ""Brand NEW"", and it will offer multiple days of entertainment. A WONDERFUL SHOW AT A VALUE PRICE, FOR CERTAIN!!!Now, . . . regarding this particular DVD release. The packaging is very simplistic, with the 4 discs being housed in separate paper sleeves inside of a center positioned holding area of an otherwise ""normal"" plastic DVD case (with the typical artwork). The actual discs themselves seem to be of typical quality, and do offer functional episode selection menus. There are no ""extras"" of any type, but this is likely to be expected of a short run series from nearly twenty years ago. The picture color and contrast are very good when using a nice upscaling player with enhancement features and when viewing on a decent HDTV. However, the picture resolution and clarity is simply ""adequate"", at best. If you are going to be viewing this series on a large widescreen television (which most will), you will absolutely NEED to set your television display mode to 4:3 format before playing (with blackout bars on left and right side of picture). The resolution offered on these DVD's simply will not properly support widescreen stretch mode, or zoom and crop (don't even waste your time trying). If you play the DVD's with a nice upscaling player, and set the television display to 4:3 format mode, the picture clarity is definitely ""decent"" and enjoyable to watch. The soundtrack is fairly simple, but very consistent with volume range, and the quality of the sound is very crisp and clear without any noticed concerns of any sort.

1408506,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B004HHX9T6,Chrijeff,"[1, 1]","Viewers who remember another one-season wonder,Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans, Vol. 1 - 3, may enjoy comparing this 40-years-later incarnation to it--and to the novel,The Last of the Mohicans (Dover Thrift Editions), from which both are loosely adapted.  The series actually doesn't have much in common with the book except for a couple of character names and the time period, at the beginning of what will be eight years of the last of the so-called ""French"" or ""French and Indian wars"" during which the two superpowers of the day, France and England, competed for control of the fantastic riches of North America--and the settlers and native peoples got caught in the middle.William Shields (Michael Berry), a successful English merchant, and his considerably younger wife Elizabeth (Lynda Carter), a native of Virginia, come to Fort Bennington in the Hudson Valley of New York, planning to take over the local trading post and hopefully acquire military contracts by way of Shields's younger brother Taylor (Garwin Sanford), whose commission William secured, and the lucrative Indian trade.  En route they're rescued from a Huron war party by Nathaniel Bumppo, better known to all and sundry as Hawkeye (Lee Horsley), and his friend Chingachgook (Rodney A. Grant), a Delaware (not Mohican!) chief among whose people he's lived for 20 years.  When the jealous and resentful Taylor engineers William's capture by the French-allied Hurons, Hawkeye and Elizabeth attempt to rescue him but fail.  Left on her own, Elizabeth must master the intricacies of commerce and the skills of the wilderness.  Hawkeye, attracted to her in spite of her ambiguous situation, teaches her to fire a musket, follow a trail, and paddle a canoe, while she in turn teaches him to read.  Often exasperated by her impulsive actions, yet deeply impressed by her courage, her devotion to her own ideals, and her respect for the Indians and their ways, he finds himself wishing that white women were more like Delaware women, who, when they're interested in a man, ""have ways of letting him know it.""  What he doesn't realize is that Elizabeth is struggling with her own feelings toward him.  Against this background are told stories of treachery and revenge, closure and friendship (both faithful and gone wrong), peril and resccue, culture clash, intrigue and adventure, and--occasionally--hints of the inexplicable.Though Hawkeye and Elizabeth make an attractive couple and you'll pull for them to find a way to be together, Taylor Shields is perhaps the most intriguing regular in the cast.  A rejected suitor of Elizabeth's, he hates William for ""taking"" her from him--and for keeping his share of their father's estate, in which he seems to me to be quite justified; it's not a matter of just a ""good"" and a ""bad"" brother--William is hardly spotless.  Taylor's bitterness leads him to plot and intrigue against his brother, and he may well be a cold-blooded murderer in connection with his efforts to get his own back, yet he's clearly intelligent, invariably respectful of Elizabeth, a patriot as he understands patriotism, a courageous leader in battle who ""takes care"" of the men under his command, and not unwilling to engage in a good old frontier-style rough-and-tumble.  His relationship with Hawkeye oscillates back and forth from mutual respect and co-operation to mutual sabotage, and you find yourself wondering what he'll come up with next.  Comic relief is often provided by Elizabeth's two young ""assistant managers,"" clever but unlucky schemer McKinney (Lachlan Munro) and his slower, generally pessimistic partner Peavey (Jed Rees), who are determined to make their fortunes on the frontier.  Among the more notable guest stars are James Cromwell as Elizabeth's visiting father and Edward Albert (son of Eddie)--speaking French as if he'd done it all his life--as the mysterious Frenchman Luc (who fights with a Japanese bo).I particularly like the costuming, ranging from Elizabeth's semi-visible corsets to the gaudy finery of the Indians, although I'm not entirely sure that the horse gear is accurate, and I know that poker didn't come into being for another 70-odd years.  Executive producer Stephen J. Cannell--best known for such series asThe Rockford Files - Season One,The A-Team: Season One, andBaretta - Season One--had never ventured any farther back into history than World War II (Baa Baa Black Sheep - Volume 1), but he does a creditable job, and the location filming in British Columbia stands in plausibly for central New York.  I only wish the writers of the closing episode had found a chance to do more with Spirit Chaser (Yvan Labelle), the dwarf Huron shaman whom Chingachgook believes traffics with dark

The land around Lake George in the Adirondack Mountains of New York looks very much like B.C. with its autumnal fogs, lush temperate forests, and frequent rainfall.Considering the Vancouver filming location of this series, the landscape does not look too much different from New York. Perhaps the Canadian mountains are a tad taller, but not too different visually from the Adirondack High Peaks. Even the plant life is similar; substitute eastern arborvitae trees (New York) instead of the series' western arborvitae tree (western Canada) and you have a similar ecology, but with B.C. having less severe winters than northern New York.The series' Fort Bennington is fictional. While there is a town named Bennington in Vermont (it played a role in the American Revolution), there was no fort, by that name, in Vermont during the 1750s. There was a British log fort, called Baum's Redoubt, in the Battle of Bennington (which was in New York, not Vermont) over 20 years later. The land which became Vermont was contested by the provincial colonies of New York and New Hampshire. So, Bennington takes its name from the Royal Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire Colony and reflects the colonists loyalties. Vermonters strongly disliked New Yorkers, called Yorkers; it's still reflected in today's sports rivalries.References are made in the show to Forts William Henry and Ticonderoga, too (real forts along Lake George and Lake Champlain), as well as Fort Carillon (which was renamed ""Ticonderoga"" by the British after it was captured).Glimmerglass Lake, mentioned in an episode co-starring actor Ron Ely, was actually Lake Ostego located several hundred of miles southwest of the Lake George area. You can visit ""Glimmerglass Lake"" in Cooperstown, N.Y., home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, and the ancestral home of author Cooper's family.While it's very loose with both history and New York-Vermont geography, ""Hawkeye"" is still good fun; it's a wonderful, visual introduction for young people--a portal to learning more about life in colonial America.",4,Good entertainment,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,2450,"['missed', 'Hawkeye', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'broadcast', '1990s', 'was', 'pleasure', 'discover', 'short-run', 'series', 'time', 'when', 'similar', 'G', 'rated', 'frontier', 'drama', 'kind', 'are', 'nonexistent', 'television.I', 'live', 'region', 'where', 'French', 'Indian', 'War', 'took', 'place', 'where', 'author', 'James', 'Fenimore', 'Cooper', 'imagined', 'Hawkeye', 'lived', 'action', 'Last', 'Mohicans', 'land', 'Lake', 'George', 'Adirondack', 'Mountains', 'New', 'York', 'very', 'much', 'B.C', 'autumnal', 'fogs', 'lush', 'temperate', 'forests', 'frequent', 'rainfall.Considering', 'Vancouver', 'filming', 'location', 'series', 'landscape', 'not', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'different', 'New', 'York', 'Perhaps', 'Canadian', 'mountains', 'are', 'tad', 'taller', 'not', 'too', 'different', 'visually', 'Adirondack', 'High', 'Peaks', 'Even', 'plant', 'life', 'similar', 'substitute', 'eastern', 'arborvitae', 'trees', 'New', 'York', 'instead', 'series', 'western', 'arborvitae', 'tree', 'western', 'Canada', 'have', 'similar', 'ecology', 'B.C', 'having', 'less', 'severe', 'winters', 'northern', 'New', 'York.The', 'series', 'Fort', 'Bennington', 'fictional', 'town', 'named', 'Bennington', 'Vermont', 'played', 'role', 'American', 'Revolution', 'was', 'fort', 'name', 'Vermont', '1750s', 'was', 'British', 'log', 'fort', 'called', 'Baum', 'Redoubt', 'Battle', 'Bennington', 'was', 'New', 'York', 'not', 'Vermont', '20', 'years', 'later', 'land', 'became', 'Vermont', 'was', 'contested', 'provincial', 'colonies', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'So', 'Bennington', 'name', 'Royal', 'Governor', 'Benning', 'Wentworth', 'New', 'Hampshire', 'Colony', 'colonists', 'loyalties', 'Vermonters', 'strongly', 'disliked', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'called', 'Yorkers', 'still', 'reflected', 'today', 'sports', 'rivalries.References', 'are', 'made', 'show', 'Forts', 'William', 'Henry', 'Ticonderoga', 'too', 'real', 'forts', 'Lake', 'George', 'Lake', 'Champlain', 'as', 'well', 'Fort', 'Carillon', 'was', 'renamed', 'Ticonderoga', 'British', 'was', 'captured', '.Glimmerglass', 'Lake', 'mentioned', 'episode', 'co-starring', 'actor', 'Ron', 'Ely', 'was', 'actually', 'Lake', 'Ostego', 'located', 'several', 'hundred', 'miles', 'southwest', 'Lake', 'George', 'area', 'can', 'visit', 'Glimmerglass', 'Lake', 'Cooperstown', 'N.Y.', 'home', 'Baseball', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'ancestral', 'home', 'author', 'Cooper', 'family.While', 'very', 'loose', 'history', 'New', 'York-Vermont', 'geography', 'Hawkeye', 'still', 'good', 'fun', 'wonderful', 'visual', 'introduction', 'young', 'people', 'portal', 'learning', 'more', 'life', 'colonial', 'America']",N/A

I used to look forward to this series to air each week on one of my local tv channels btween 1993 and 1994 when it first aired. It is typical that a fun and clean family show like this went off the air so quickly. Some people claimed that series did not do so well in the ratings but that simply was not true. The series was very expensive to film. It was on location filming that was done in  British Columbia. The weather was often very cold and stormy. There was also a lot of commuting back and forth for Lynda Carter. She flew home each weekend after weekly filming. Lynda has always been more concerned about her family than acting. So between the expense of catering to the cast and on location filming and harsh weather the producer wished to end the series by the following spring. Luckily, this is one series that produced a last episode that closed everything up. Everything was sewn up wonderfully and satisfying for the viewer who had seen the whole series. It was like when the Fugitive finally caught the ""one arm bandit"". I absolutely loved this show. I loved its production values and the entire cast. Even all the villians did a great job with their roles. I loved to hate Taylor Shields and I looked up to Hawkeye and marveled at the lady that Lynda Carter portrayed of which she really did not have to act. She was really playing her own self. She is most definately a lady and a lady to be admired not just in beauty but in grace.My only gripe with the dvd's are the fact that they made a nice case but the dvd's are inside paper sleeves. There are also no bonus materials on this. It is like they just rushed them through. I am happy though that they finally released this series.

The first, ""Paradise,"" was a wonderful western that ran for 2 1/2 years on CBS starting in 1987.  The second was this terrific syndicated series produced by the late Stephen J. Cannell, the legendary producer of ""The Rockford Files,"" among others.  This show premiered shortly after the release of the great adventure film ""The Last of the Mohecans.""  (Footage from that film appears in the series' pilot."") Horsley plays frontiersman Hawkeye who lives in the wilderness with his indian friend Chingachkook in close proximity to a British fort in 1755, the period of the French and Indian War.  Carter plays a lovely English woman who comes to the Fort with her older husband to open a general store.  The husband is quickly captured by the indians but never declared dead.  This causes the burgeoning romance between Horsley and Carter to never be consumated.  Carter looks great and the dress designers of the series allow her to show ample cleavage.This series was filmed in Vancouver and has terrific scenery and lots of action.  It was syndicated and shown at different times in different parts of the country.  Unfortunately it only lasted one year.  I've only watched the first 2 episodes (the 2 hour pilot,) and the picture and sound seem fine.  Unfortunately there are no extras.  (I would have loved a retrospective with Horsley and Carter.

1408548,A2ZELOPYDRS6VU,B004HHX9T6,Love Our Military Men,"[12, 12]","This is absolutely one of the best TV series I've ever seen! It's a Last of the Mohichans style type series that is set in an 18th century setting and the photography is visually stunning, with lush meadows and streams and fantastic performances by Lynda Carter (""Elizabeth Shields"") and Lee Horsley in the title role. Although it was a short lived series, the wonderful thing was that it had a conclusion, so the viewer was not left hanging with a series that was cancelled mid-stream. This is a series that can be enjoyed by the entire family. And you can't beat the price point! (This was so good, that quite honestly, I am surprised that it wasn't going for a huge premium when it was released, which is good - so everyone who wants a copy can afford one.) Enjoy HAWKEYE - it's worth every cent!!The episode list is as follows:(Disc 1)1. HAWKEYE (PILOT: PART 1) - In the series opener, Hawkeye saves merchant William Shields and his wife Elizabeth, when they're ambushed by hostile Indians.2. HAWKEYE (PILOT: PART 2) - Hawkeye and Elizabeth get a taste of the French and Indian War when they head off to negotiate for the release of Elizabeth's husband, who has been captured by the French.3. THE BEAR - Hawkeye's lesson in wilderness-survival skills - and Hawkeye's reading lesson - are interrupted by ammunition thieves bent on selling their goods to the French.4. THE FURLOUGH - Hawkeye saves a settler from the trader who kidnapped her, and kills him in the process - prompting revenge from the trader's Huron allies.5. THE SIEGE - The French lay siege to Fort Bennington, and expect reinforcements in the form of a cannon ""the size of Massachusetts.""(Disc 2)6. THE CHILD - Hurons kidnap an infant - and an attempt to get the child back could spark a war.7. THE VISION - Chingachgook has a vision: Hawkeye will be killed by hostile Indians.8. OUT OF THE PAST - Hawkeye's mentor arrives - not for a reunion but for revenge. And Elizabeth is the bait.9. THE WARRIOR - Elizabeth's nephew realizes his dream of becoming a soldier, but when his courage fails in battle, Hawkeye and Chingachook step in to help.10. THE QUEST - When a stranger offers - for a hefty fee - to lead Elizabeth to William, a suspicious Taylor and Hawkeye insist on going along.(Disc 3)11. THE ESCAPE - The brother of a man Taylor had executed seeks revenge by luring the captain and Elizabeth on a business expedition that will lead to their capture by the French.12. FLY WITH ME - Hawkeye and Chingachook conspire to help two runaway slaves being returned to their owner by a Virginia ""gentleman"".13. THE ALLEY - A provoked attack on Taylor prompts the captain to ban the Delaware tribe - Chingachgook included - from Fort Bennington.14. THE BOXER - An enigmatic French prisoner intrigues Hawkeye, who begins to believe that the soldier may not be what he seems.15. THE TRAITOR - Taylor has Hawkeye tried for treason when the captain is shot soon after a heated arguement between the two men. But Hawkeye's sense of honor hinders Elizabeth's efforts to prove his innocence.16. THE AMNESTY - Hawkeye fumes when Taylor grants a pardon to a recalcitrant soldier in exchange for information about the French.(Disc 4)17. THE VISIT - Elizabeth resists her father's efforts to bring her back to Virginia - even after Taylor produces new evidence about her missing husband.18. VENGEANCE IS MINE - The capture of a chief's wife leads Hawkeye to his parent's killer, and Elizabeth may not be able to stop him from taking revenge.19. THE PLAGUE - A chief blames Elizabeth for a smallpox epidemic that spreads after her inadvertent violation of sacred Indian ground.20. HESTER - A woman with healing powers struggles to save Fort Bennington from an epidemic, only to be branded a witch. One thing's for sure - Hawkeye has fallen under her spell.21. THE BOUNTY - An old friend appeals to Hawkeye to help free her brother-in-law from his captors: but, to complicate matters, the enemy has put a bounty on Hawkeye's head.22. THE RETURN - Elizabeth's husband returns from captivity, but while she stuggles to make a decision about her future, Chingachgook questions William's association with a shaman who practices ""black arts"".Picture quality is quite good.

1408553,A1X1YUHSEX3UZU,B004HHX9T6,marla a. sharp,"[0, 0]","This series is pure enjoyment.  It is well written, humorous, thoughtful, and beautifully filmed.  No, it's not shot like a current 'modern' series, but I actually find that a relief.  This is more focused on the characters, rather than on 'flash bang' or 'research display' modes that so much of 'modern' tv is.  My mother and sisters pile in to watch episodes with me and we have all really loved it.  It has all the 'adult' issues a series set in that time would have--dangers of rape, torture, murder, loss of loved ones, bitter decisions, struggle to just stay alive/make a go of it, etc.--but without the ugliness of graphic shots to show them.  More substance than just going for the shock value you get in CSI and such.  I really enjoy how the characters are developed--their facial expressions, mannerisms, interactions, etc., all come together to make for people you fully enjoy being a part of.  They are capable of foolishness, hardness, kindness, humor, heroism, or villainy all in turns.  I have laughed hard on some of their interactions--like the Captain's outraged &#34;Elizabeth!&#34; when she admits to having resorted to hiding rifles, powder and shot--and her equally mixed defiant and humored defense of it--she wouldn't have to if he would curb his tendency to repeatedly confiscate them at every emergency!  I am honestly very glad that I bought it--and will definitely re-watch it often.
