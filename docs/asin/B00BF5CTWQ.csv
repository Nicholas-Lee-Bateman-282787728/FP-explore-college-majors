1634301,A3RPNJODORTLRB,B00BF5CTWQ,Nasahr,"[1, 1]","I love Top Gear, I'm a huge fan but this season it just seems like the presenters, especially Jeremy Clarkson weren't really enjoying what they where doing.. Like the African special really seems like it was forced, i hate to admit but it was by far the least interesting special they ever had. I hope season 20 and 21 goes back to the old top gear way of three immature men having a lot of fun and talking about cars. The way i see it season 18 was the last great season. I fully enjoyed it and had a lot of fun watching it.",4,Not as good as previous seasons,1386720000,"12 11, 2013",2013,525,"['love', 'Top', 'Gear', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'season', 'just', 'presenters', 'especially', 'Jeremy', 'Clarkson', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'enjoying', 'what', 'where', 'doing..', 'African', 'special', 'really', 'was', 'forced', 'i', 'hate', 'admit', 'was', 'far', 'least', 'interesting', 'special', 'ever', 'had', 'hope', 'season', '20', '21', 'back', 'old', 'top', 'gear', 'way', 'three', 'immature', 'men', 'having', 'lot', 'fun', 'talking', 'cars', 'way', 'i', 'see', 'season', '18', 'was', 'last', 'great', 'season', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching']",Top Gear 19 (DVD)

It had a few good moments on the trip in Africa, but mostly it was a rehash of previous pranks, races and interviews.

Not to be confused with the American version which in Amazon terms is worthy of only about 2 stars.  I own all published seasons from 10 through 19 and would own every season but as of yet 1-9 is not produced in a dvd format.  This is a great, great show to sit down and get a few laughs from but also to check out awesome cars that most people will never even see on the road much less own.",5,The best!!!,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,486,"['have', 'never', 'watched', 'shows', 'great', 'season', 'capture', 'interest', 'Not', 'be', 'confused', 'American', 'version', 'Amazon', 'terms', 'worthy', 'only', '2', 'stars', 'own', 'published', 'seasons', '10', '19', 'would', 'own', 'season', 'yet', '1-9', 'not', 'produced', 'dvd', 'format', 'great', 'great', 'show', 'sit', 'down', 'get', 'few', 'laughs', 'also', 'check', 'out', 'awesome', 'cars', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'never', 'even', 'see', 'road', 'much', 'less', 'own']",Top Gear 19 (DVD)
