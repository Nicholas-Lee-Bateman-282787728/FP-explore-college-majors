The three leads: Cary Grant, Carole Lombard and Kay Francis are truly magnificent in their respective roles, giving supreme, skilled, understated performances.This involving film tells the story of the beautiful love that is born and developed, between fashion designer & widowed Carole Lombard and rich, unhappily married, Cary Grant, and how the principal ""obstacle"" in their path, Grant's selfish wife, played by Kay Francis, tries to destroy this strong bond, not for the love of her husband, but because she won't give up the money and social position that this marriage grants her. Francis plays one of the ""least apparent"" villainess ever, manipulating everyone, especially her in-laws, for her own sake.This is classic romantic drama at its best, released in that glorious year of 1939, in which Grant and especially Lombard, achieve top-dramatic performances. This film, like the magnificent 1941 Penny Serenade, really demonstrates the acting range of Cary Grant as a dramatic actor. On the other hand, if you liked Carole Lombard in 1939's ""Made for Each Other"" with Jimmy Stewart, you'll love her here.It is sad that this was Lombard's and Grant's only romantic pairing, because they've got great chemistry.

Bernabo,"[3, 3]","&quot;In Name Only&quot; is a poignant look at an unhappy marriage that provides Carole Lombard with arguably her finest non-comedy performance and film.  Based on the novel &quot;Memory of Love&quot; by Bessie Brewer, this 1939 film casts Lombard as Julie Eden, a young widow who rents a summer cottage in Connecticut near the estate of Alec Walker (Cary Grant).  The two have fallen in love and Alec wants to get a divorce from his wife, Maida (Kay Francis), who only married him for his position and money.  Maida appears to give in and promises to obtain a divorce in Paris, but when she returns after a long absence she announces that she will never divorce Alec and threatens to sue Julie for alienation of affection should Alec sue for divorce.  It looks like Julie and Alec will never life happily ever after, but that same night Alec develops a serious case of pneumonia.It is rather surprising that this film is generally devoid of humor, given the two stars, but the subject matter does not lend itself to comedy.  When Julie and Alec talk about Reno, there is an overriding sense of melancholy, because the dream seems so far beyond their reach.  Talking about it is a way of keeping the dream alive, but the situation seems so hopeless.  True, this hopelessness seems alien to us, but the Walkers live in a world where reputation apparently matters more than money.  Lombard's performance is fascinating simply because she is doing a lot of what she does in her comedies, what with the bewildered look in her eyes and the melancholy voice, but now it works to evoke a sense of tragedy rather than farce.Then there is Kay Francis as the manipulative Maida, an unpleasant character who presents herself as understanding and patient to Alec's parents (Charles Coburn and Nella Walker) as she tries to drive a wedge between them and their son in order to get her father-in-law's fortune.  Grant's character is the minor figure here, because what matters is the two women.  While Maida stretches out the trip to Europe, clearly intending for Julie to doubt Alec's resolve and to cause fatal cracks in their relationship, our focus is on Julie's face and what we can read about what she is thinking as her chances for happiness slip away.The flaw in this film is the conclusion, although I do not know if the fault for this is with the original novel or Richard Sherman's screenplay.  But the ending because traditional Hollywood melodrama.  Alec is dying, but Julie, the only one that can give him the will to live, is not allowed to come to his bedside.  Then Maida shows up and is instructed by the script to suddenly snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and in the rush to provide a happy ending &quot;In Name Only&quot; throws away everything the two actresses had so successfully created until that point in the film.",4,Only a flawed ending mars Lombard's finest dramatic role,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,2832,"['quot', 'Name', 'Only', 'quot', 'poignant', 'look', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'Carole', 'Lombard', 'arguably', 'finest', 'non-comedy', 'performance', 'film', 'Based', 'novel', 'quot', 'Memory', 'Love', 'quot', 'Bessie', 'Brewer', '1939', 'film', 'casts', 'Lombard', 'Julie', 'Eden', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'summer', 'cottage', 'Connecticut', 'estate', 'Alec', 'Walker', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'two', 'have', 'fallen', 'love', 'Alec', 'get', 'divorce', 'wife', 'Maida', 'Kay', 'Francis', 'who', 'only', 'married', 'position', 'money', 'Maida', 'give', 'promises', 'obtain', 'divorce', 'Paris', 'when', 'long', 'absence', 'will', 'never', 'divorce', 'Alec', 'sue', 'Julie', 'alienation', 'affection', 'should', 'Alec', 'sue', 'divorce', 'Julie', 'Alec', 'will', 'never', 'life', 'happily', 'ever', 'same', 'night', 'Alec', 'serious', 'case', 'pneumonia.It', 'rather', 'surprising', 'film', 'generally', 'devoid', 'humor', 'given', 'two', 'stars', 'subject', 'matter', 'not', 'lend', 'comedy', 'When', 'Julie', 'Alec', 'talk', 'Reno', 'overriding', 'sense', 'melancholy', 'dream', 'so', 'far', 'reach', 'Talking', 'way', 'keeping', 'dream', 'alive', 'situation', 'so', 'hopeless', 'True', 'hopelessness', 'alien', 'Walkers', 'live', 'world', 'where', 'reputation', 'apparently', 'more', 'money', 'Lombard', 'performance', 'fascinating', 'simply', 'doing', 'lot', 'what', 'comedies', 'what', 'bewildered', 'look', 'eyes', 'melancholy', 'voice', 'now', 'evoke', 'sense', 'tragedy', 'rather', 'farce.Then', 'Kay', 'Francis', 'manipulative', 'Maida', 'unpleasant', 'character', 'who', 'understanding', 'patient', 'Alec', 'parents', 'Charles', 'Coburn', 'Nella', 'Walker', 'drive', 'wedge', 'son', 'order', 'get', 'father-in-law', 'fortune', 'Grant', 'character', 'minor', 'figure', 'here', 'what', 'matters', 'two', 'women', 'Maida', 'out', 'trip', 'Europe', 'clearly', 'intending', 'Julie', 'doubt', 'Alec', 'resolve', 'cause', 'fatal', 'cracks', 'relationship', 'focus', 'Julie', 'face', 'what', 'can', 'read', 'what', 'thinking', 'chances', 'happiness', 'slip', 'away.The', 'flaw', 'film', 'conclusion', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'fault', 'original', 'novel', 'Richard', 'Sherman', 'screenplay', 'ending', 'traditional', 'Hollywood', 'melodrama', 'Alec', 'dying', 'Julie', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'give', 'will', 'live', 'not', 'allowed', 'come', 'bedside', 'Then', 'Maida', 'up', 'instructed', 'script', 'suddenly', 'snatch', 'defeat', 'jaws', 'victory', 'rush', 'provide', 'happy', 'ending', 'quot', 'Name', 'Only', 'quot', 'away', 'everything', 'two', 'actresses', 'had', 'so', 'successfully', 'created', 'point', 'film']",N/A

The ice cold Maida married Alec only for his money and doesn't care that the love of her life committed suicide when she jilted him.  Alec meets and falls in love with beautiful young widow Julie Eden(Carole Lombard) who is as warm and loving as Maida is cold-blooded and grasping.  Their affair becomes a scandal and Alec's rather naive parents(Charles Coburn and Nella Walker), who have been won over by the conniving Maida, take Maida's side.  Alec demands a divorce and, being a gentleman, will let Maida file for it.  Maida agrees but with a stipulation:  she is going to spend the fall in Paris with Alec's parents and will file for it there so as not to become a ""gossip holiday for my friends"".  Alec, who is a bit naive himself, agrees, not suspecting Maida is going to double cross him.  Summer turns into winter and Alec and Julie learn from Maida's best friend Suzanne(Helen Vinson in a deliciously catty performance) that Maida never had any intention of divorcing him.  You guessed it:  in movies like this when all seems hopeless the hero always comes down with pneumoia at a big holiday and Alec does not escape his Hollywood ordained fate.  As Alec lies dying in the hospital on Christmas day his doctors tell Julie to lie to him and tell him that Maida has finally consented to a divorce.  The hope it gives him will ensure his survival.  Maida and Julie have it out at the hospital.  Maida tells Julie she doesn't want just Alec's money but his father's too.  Alec's parents overhear this and finally wise up.  Julie and Mr & Mrs Walker go into Alec's room and Maida is left alone outside.1939 is considered Hollywood's greatest year.  This movie isn't one of the reasons why.  Not much of a plot, even by the standards of chick flicks.  What elevates ""In Name Only"" is the quietly intelligent direction of John Cromwell and the sophistication of the three leads.

Kay Francis plays Maida, the heartless wife of Grant who married him for his money and social position.  The performances in this all but forgotten little 1939 gem are generally excellent with Lombard taking the acting honours.  Carole plays her role of Julie Eden in a refreshingly natural and unaffected way which was quite uncommon in the late thirties;  her performance still looks fresh today. As the mercenary Maida, Francis is more affected, but she had the ability to make one dislike her instensely;  hers is a typical thirties leading-lady performance.  Grant is his usual devil-may-care rascally self and there's really nothing surprising about him in this, however his comic timing is superb as usual.  As Maida's &quot;best friend&quot; Suzanne, the largely forgotten Helen Vinson is both funny and bitchy in an obvious yet amusing way.  The best scene has Kay admit to Carole that she's been conniving to get a huge settlement after Grant's Dad (the great Charles Coburn) passes away - however, she made a stupid blunder - she says this confession within Coburn's presence (which is unknown to her)  and he at last he realises what a witch his perfectly charming daughter-in-law really is!  Lombard's daughter is played by a very young Peggy Ann Garner and Carole's sister is played by a familiar actress - whose name escapes me - and she overacted in her histrionic playing.  The photography was beautiful and the quality of the VHS print was sharp and clear; even the musical score was engaging.  A harmless little movie which can give viewers some insight on the the dramatic side of the uniquely gifted Carole Lombard who was equally adept at Screwball comedies.  Clark Gable and Lombard were married the year this flick was made; she tragically died while going on a war bond tour (which was highly successful) when the airplane in which she and her mother were travelling in crashed into the side of of a mountain in either Nevada or the Sierra Nevadas in California. Gable was never the same after her death and kept seeking women who had the same qualities - in looks and character - as his beloved &quot;Ma&quot;.  President Roosevelt gave her a heartfelt eulogy and the nation mourned for this beautiful, unaffected lady who died too young at 34. Lombard's last picture was arguably one of her best: TO BE OR NOT TO BE, a Lubitsch satire on the Nazis in which she co-starred with none other than Jack Benny (!)
