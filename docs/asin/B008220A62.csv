Maybe not.For the 2011 film ""Hysteria"", directed by Tanya Wexler (""Finding North"", ""Ball in the House"") and writers Stephen and Jonah Lisa Dyer, they explore the invention of the device.  But instead of presenting a film that you would imagine to be sexually naughty, they present the film to show how the invention of the device was due to how women's hysteria (nervousness, loss of appetite, stress, sexual desire) was treated back in the late 1800&#8242;s.Long ago, female hysteria was once-common medical diagnosis that dates back for hundreds and possibly thousands of years.  And the diagnosis and treatment for hundreds of years was through pelvic massage, rather the manual stimulation of the vulva by a doctor trained in producing of what was called ""hysterical paroxysm"".  It was realized later on that ""hysterical paroxysm"" would be better known as an ""orgasm"".And one of those doctors who treated women was Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville, the man, along with an inventor would go on to create the first electromechanical vibrator (which would be known as Granville's Hammer) in 1883.With the film ""Hysteria"", while not entirely a factual biography of Granville's life, the film is based on a true story.The British film would star Hugh Dancy (""Black Hawk Down"", ""King Arthur"", ""Confessions of a Shopaholic""), Maggie Gyllenhaal (""The Dark Knight"", ""Donnie Darko""), Jonathan Pryce (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, ""Brazil"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), Felicity Jones (""Like Crazy"", ""The Tempest""), Rupert Everett (""My Best Friend's Wedding"", ""Shrek"" films) and Ashley Jensen (""Ugly Betty"").And now, ""Hysteria"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in Sept. 2012 courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics.""Hysteria"" is set in the 19th Century, during a time where women were treated for their hysteria by massaging the vulva/genital area of a woman to produce a ""paroxysmal convulsion"" and among the men who specialized in it was Dr. Robert Dalrymple (portrayed by Jonathan Pryce).  Dr. Robert Dalrymple is a reputable man who has two daughters, the kind and proper Emily (portrayed by Felicity Jones) and her older sister, the rebellious Charlotte (portrayed by Maggie Gyllenhaal), a pre-modern feminist.Robert needs another to help him in his practice, so he hires a young doctor named Dr. Mortimer Granville (portrayed by Hugh Dancy) and as Mortimer learns how to treat women through his training sessions observing Dr. Dalrymple, he starts to date Emily.And as Dr. Granville becomes well-known for his work, the practice begins to gain a good following and more women start to come in.  But it also starts to affect Dr. Granville's hand muscles and women start to feel that he is not being affective in bringing out their paroxysmal convulsions.  It embarrasses Dr. Dalrymple to have his popular clients feeling unfulfilled, that he has to fire Dr. Granville.Staying with his friend Lord Edmunt St. John-Smythe (portrayed by Rupert Everett), an inventor trying to perfect his invention, an electronic feather duster.  While holding it, he starts to realize how soothing it feels on his hand courtesy of its vibrations.  And then Dr. Granville comes up with an idea, how about using this invention to create a vibrator that can be used to create paroxysmal convulsions, so a doctor no longer needs to use his hand?And sure enough, he tests the new invention on Molly the Lolly (portrayed by Sheridan Smith) and in a short amount of time, he is able to produce three paroxysmal convulsions.  Shocked by the success of the device, what if Dr. Granville can utilize the device on a woman for treatment of hysteria?Meanwhile, problems develop between Dr. Robert Dalrymple and his rebellious daughter Charlotte.  And as the family tends to avoid her, Dr. Granville starts to see the good in her and starts to fall for her.  But what of his relationship with Emily?VIDEO:""Hysteria"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 aspect ratio).  First, I have to say that the costume design for this film is wonderful.  And watching this film in HD, definitely brings out the details of the Victorian style.  Closeups are well-detailed, skintones are natural, black levels nice and deep.  The film looks very good on Blu-ray and I detected no banding or artifact issues during my viewing of ""Hysteria"".AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Hysteria"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and is primarily a dialogue driven film.  Aside from one case where the testing of the vibrator uses up the electricity and you hear a pop, the majority of the film is dialogue and its musical soundtrack.  Both are crystal clear and there is some use of surround channels during scenes featuring a crowd.Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Hindi.SPECIAL FEATURES""Hysteria?"" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary - Featuring an upbeat audio commentary by Director Tanya Wexler.An Evening with Tanya Wexler, Hugh Dancy and Jonathan Pryce - (12:26) Director Tanya Wexler, Hugh Dancy and Jonathan Pryce answers questions from the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival.Hysteria: Behind the Scenes - (5:41) A behind-the-scenes look at the making of the film with the director, producers and talent of ""Hysteria"".Deleted Scenes - (2:52) Featuring four deleted scenes.Passion & Power: The Technology of Orgasm - (43:07) A documentary on the origin of the vibrator and the treatment of hysteria.Theatrical Trailer - (1:26) The original theatrical trailer for ""Hysteria"".JUDGMENT CALL:I'm often curious about how things are invented, but when I saw the trailer for ""Hysteria"" and how it dealt with the invention of the vibrator, not only did it catch my eye, I was fascinated by the concept but also even more intrigued about how female hysteria was treated by doctors through genital massages to produce what would be know as an orgasm.I never knew that there was such a medical disorder and that doctors were specially trained to handle such a thing.And while the trailer may lead one to think that such a film would be naughty and doctors using such a practice for their own sexual desires, fortunately ""Hysteria"" is not that.  This was a longtime practice and belief that women had symptoms that can be alleviated by a pelvic massage and that a person can be alleviated of their stress, sexual desires, nervousness, muscle spasms via""hysterical paroxysm"" (or orgasm).And I can see in a medical sense, how the vibrator would be an important device for doctors at that time, because so many women were being treated, these doctors would suffer muscular cramps on their hands because some women would not respond and have a hysterical paroxysm so easily.So, that was all intriguing to me and the story based on the creation of the vibrator because of the treatment of hysteria was fascinating.  Granted, although based on a true story, I'm not sure if the life of Dr. Mortimer Granville was as exciting.  His life was surely romanticized for ""Hysteria"" and given much humor, the film was entertaining.  Especially to see how a feather duster would eventually lead to the vibrator is amusing and how its presented is quite fun and hilarious.""Hysteria"" was no doubt an entertaining film thanks to its talents.  Hugh Dancy, Jonathan Pryce, Felicity Jones and Rupert Everett were great.  And as for Maggie Gyllenhaal, I was worried how she would portray an English accent but sure enough, she did a magnificent job.As for the Blu-ray release of ""Hysteria"", while the picture quality and audio quality were very good, it's the inclusion of the documentary ""Passion & Power: The Technology of Orgasm"" that I found educational and entertaining.  I had no idea that treatment of hysteria has gone on so long and was recorded by physicians.  But the amount of research that went into making this documentary was fascinating and to see how the perception of vibrators have changed.  From being featured to magazines in the distant past to some states having strict rules for women (especially the state of Dallas) who has no law of how many guns a man can have, but yet a woman who has more than five vibrators is breaking the law.  Interesting!Overall, ""Hysteria"" is a fascinating and fun film that shows people of a past that probably, many have forgotten or didn't know about.  But also how the invention of the vibrator came to be.  Fun, naughty and entertaining, ""Hysteria"" on Blu-ray is recommended.",4,A fascinating comedy about how hysteria was treated for women in the 1800&#8242;s and how it would lead to the invention of

1541588,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B008220A62,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 5]",". . . or just hand him a machine--which is the premise behind the  otherwise formulaic 2012 romantic comedy, ""Hysteria,"" directed by Tanya Wexler.  Strip this story of its vibrator and for the most part, the audience can expect the usual boy meets girl scenario with the traditional outcome albeit in this case with some seemingly unrealistic situations emphasized in their preposterousness to titillate a supposedly more modern audience already in the know with regard to that panacea to stave off civilization's most dehabilitating setback: ennui.Stephen Dyer and Jonah Lisa Dyer's screenplay is loosely based on the historical fact that Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville patented the first electromagnetic vibrator in 1880 as a handy-dandy tool designed to help fellow doctors better administer relaxing ""pelvic massage"" to their female patient's suffering from ""hysteria"" or ""melancholia.""  This approach as a solution to women's `ailments' as explored in various formats in other films like ""A Dangerous Method,"" ""The Crimson Petal & The White"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo,"" suggests the inherent dominance of a male-centric world.  In all three of these examples, the woman in question (Sabina, Agnes and Madeline/Judy) must undergo some sort of revelatory situation in which the man in her life helps her to understand that whatever she is experiencing is only a dream, a fantasy or a projection.  By ""seeing"" this, she submits to the power of the man and his projection of what reality actually is, as he, as master of his universe, defines it.  While ""Hysteria"" handles this premise a bit more humorously, the bottom line is still one and the same.  Without the testimony of the good doctor towards the end of the film, our pre-1960s feminist, embodied by the character of Charlotte Dalrymple (Maggie Gyllenhaal), would still be subjected to imprisonment, psychological evaluation and hysterectomy/sterilization.  Today's solution?  Perhaps, a variety of pharmaceuticals?Wexler's film asks its viewer to look at a frankly disturbing subject--the inability of many people to fit within the format of their own carefully crafted cages and the body, mind and spirit's reaction to a self-imposed trap that prevents any growth--and laughingly intuit that the solution lies in the release from manual stimulation as provided by a machine.That, in itself, is cutsy-funny.  And that's the way this film should be viewed--as a spoof where dozens of women line up every day outside a doctor's office to undergo ""treatment"" and because they do not really know what they are experiencing continue to return for the same ""quickie"" fix.  When Dr. Granville (Hugh Darcy) who would have been played with more angelic chagrin by Hugh Grant, finds his hands cramping during his therapies, he and his inventor friend St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett) devise a mechanized version with the beginnings of that mythical `staying power' that Samantha Jones ofSex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Gift Set)will appreciate more than a century later.  Almost pathetically, the patients are so happy they burst out into song and not-so-knowing smiles of pure bliss.  Sad to think that that's all it takes.In ""Hysteria,"" Granville works as apprentice to Dr. Dalrymple (played with austere pomposity by Jonathan Price) and as a most suitable helper with much potential to feather Dalrymple's retirement nest with much plumage, he is quickly viewed as a worthy suitor to Dalrymple's conventional daughter, Emily (Felicity Jone--that is, until in trueHolidayfashion (Cary Grant cannot help his attraction to non-conformist sister Katherine Hepburn), he butts heads with not-so-sweet, but dedicated, Charlotte.  Of course, the audience is fully aware that this switch will happen.  Unfortunately, the means by which it occurs asks for another suspension of what we know to be real to ensure that inevitable frothy ending where the couple lives happily ever after.  I can only wonder what their intimate life would have been like:) - perhaps a DickensianFifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set?Bottom line?  ""Hysteria"" tries to be hysterically amusing.  It has its moments; however, for the most part, its ebb into the familiar territory of boy meets feisty girl and its dependence on some pretty farcical situations in the doctor's surgery make this Victorian's Secret one to watch while you multitask.Diana Faillace Von Behren""reneofc""",3,Give the Doctor a Hand . . .,1349222400,"10 3, 2012",2012,4488,"['just', 'hand', 'machine', 'premise', 'otherwise', 'formulaic', '2012', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Hysteria', 'directed', 'Tanya', 'Wexler', 'Strip', 'story', 'vibrator', 'most', 'part', 'audience', 'can', 'expect', 'usual', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'scenario', 'traditional', 'outcome', 'albeit', 'case', 'seemingly', 'unrealistic', 'situations', 'emphasized', 'preposterousness', 'titillate', 'supposedly', 'more', 'modern', 'audience', 'already', 'know', 'regard', 'panacea', 'stave', 'off', 'civilization', 'most', 'dehabilitating', 'setback', 'ennui.Stephen', 'Dyer', 'Jonah', 'Lisa', 'Dyer', 'screenplay', 'loosely', 'based', 'historical', 'fact', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'Mortimer', 'Granville', 'patented', 'first', 'electromagnetic', 'vibrator', '1880', 'handy-dandy', 'tool', 'designed', 'help', 'fellow', 'doctors', 'better', 'administer', 'relaxing', 'pelvic', 'massage', 'female', 'patient', 'suffering', 'hysteria', 'melancholia', 'approach', 'solution', 'women', 'ailments', 'explored', 'various', 'formats', 'other', 'films', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Method', 'Crimson', 'Petal', 'White', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Vertigo', 'inherent', 'dominance', 'male-centric', 'world', 'three', 'examples', 'woman', 'question', 'Sabina', 'Agnes', 'Madeline/Judy', 'must', 'undergo', 'sort', 'revelatory', 'situation', 'man', 'life', 'understand', 'whatever', 'experiencing', 'only', 'dream', 'fantasy', 'projection', 'seeing', 'power', 'man', 'projection', 'what', 'reality', 'actually', 'master', 'universe', 'Hysteria', 'premise', 'bit', 'more', 'humorously', 'bottom', 'line', 'still', 'one', 'same', 'testimony', 'good', 'doctor', 'end', 'film', 'pre-1960s', 'feminist', 'embodied', 'character', 'Charlotte', 'Dalrymple', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'subjected', 'imprisonment', 'psychological', 'evaluation', 'hysterectomy/sterilization', 'Today', 'solution', 'Perhaps', 'variety', 'pharmaceuticals', 'Wexler', 'film', 'viewer', 'look', 'frankly', 'disturbing', 'subject', 'inability', 'many', 'people', 'fit', 'format', 'own', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'cages', 'body', 'mind', 'spirit', 'reaction', 'self-imposed', 'trap', 'growth', 'laughingly', 'intuit', 'solution', 'release', 'manual', 'stimulation', 'provided', 'machine.That', 'cutsy-funny', 'way', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'spoof', 'where', 'dozens', 'women', 'line', 'day', 'doctor', 'office', 'undergo', 'treatment', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'experiencing', 'continue', 'return', 'same', 'quickie', 'fix', 'When', 'Dr.', 'Granville', 'Hugh', 'Darcy', 'who', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'more', 'angelic', 'chagrin', 'Hugh', 'Grant', 'hands', 'cramping', 'therapies', 'inventor', 'friend', 'St.', 'John-Smythe', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'devise', 'mechanized', 'version', 'beginnings', 'mythical', 'staying', 'power', 'Samantha', 'Jones', 'ofSex', 'City', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Collector', 'Gift', 'Set', 'will', 'appreciate', 'more', 'century', 'later', 'Almost', 'pathetically', 'patients', 'are', 'so', 'happy', 'burst', 'out', 'song', 'not-so-knowing', 'smiles', 'pure', 'bliss', 'Sad', 'think', 'Hysteria', 'Granville', 'apprentice', 'Dr.', 'Dalrymple', 'played', 'austere', 'pomposity', 'Jonathan', 'Price', 'most', 'suitable', 'helper', 'much', 'potential', 'feather', 'Dalrymple', 'retirement', 'nest', 'much', 'plumage', 'quickly', 'viewed', 'worthy', 'suitor', 'Dalrymple', 'conventional', 'daughter', 'Emily', 'Felicity', 'Jone', 'trueHolidayfashion', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'attraction', 'non-conformist', 'sister', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'butts', 'heads', 'not-so-sweet', 'dedicated', 'Charlotte', 'course', 'audience', 'fully', 'aware', 'switch', 'will', 'happen', 'Unfortunately', 'means', 'asks', 'suspension', 'what', 'know', 'be', 'real', 'ensure', 'inevitable', 'frothy', 'ending', 'where', 'couple', 'happily', 'ever', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'what', 'intimate', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perhaps', 'DickensianFifty', 'Shades', 'Trilogy', 'Fifty', 'Shades', 'Grey', 'Fifty', 'Shades', 'Darker', 'Fifty', 'Shades', 'Freed', '3-volume', 'Boxed', 'Set', 'Bottom', 'line', 'Hysteria', 'be', 'hysterically', 'amusing', 'moments', 'however', 'most', 'part', 'ebb', 'familiar', 'territory', 'boy', 'meets', 'feisty', 'girl', 'dependence', 'pretty', 'farcical', 'situations', 'doctor', 'surgery', 'make', 'Victorian', 'Secret', 'one', 'watch', 'multitask.Diana', 'Faillace', 'Von', 'Behren', 'reneofc']",N/A

Although I've seen better portrayals, ""Hysteria"" captures Victorian England quite well. This film is also genuinely funny at times if one has some appreciation for the bawdy (although there's no nudity). It's often said that comedy is most effective in dramatizing serious conflicts and situations; however, I was a little uncertain on where this was going and how to take it until the very end, where what we are told and shown makes sense of at least most of it. Still, the various disparate themes--early feminism, the fallacious catch-all diagnosis of female ""hysteria,"" and the history of the vibrator (?)--don't entirely tie together, and the whole film seems incomplete. It's also a little unclear on how factual or fictional certain details, such as the bit about the Queen herself, are supposed to be, and where the directors are trying to convey solid history and where they're just having fun.

Based on the original story by Howard Gensler and adapted for the screen by Stephen Dyer and Jonah Lisa Dyer  HYSTERIA addresses women's rights and women's needs in Victorian England.  As a bit of history it is essential knowledge: as a film it is supremely entertaining!In the1880s (Victorian period) London, Dr. Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy) is an idealistic young doctor fresh out of training struggles against staid old-fashioned physicians who refuse to keep up with science to establish himself. Nearing the end of his rope he is hired by Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) who is renowned for treating women diagnosed with female hysteria using 'pelvic massage'.  (`Hysteria' was originally defined as a neurotic condition peculiar to women and thought to be caused by a dysfunction of the uterus!'). By the 19th century, hysteria came to be defined as a more generalized sexual dysfunction. Dr. Granville sets about becoming an expert in the problem, seeking devices to remedy the problem. However, he develops carpal tunnel due to all the manual labor required in stimulation. His invention is the vibrator! In the midst of the story we meet Dr.Dalrymple's two daughters - the renegade, women's rights devotee, idealistic and compassionate Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose work with the poor house patients angers her father, and the talented and charming demure Emily (Felicity Jones) who the father sees as the proper physician's wife. It is the coming together of Dr. Granville's invention (originally the concept of his wealthy friend Edmund St. John-Smythe - Rupert Everett) and Charlotte's outlook on life that brings the cast of characters and story to a satisfying close.Tanya Wexler directs this excellent cast with just the right amount of `suggestion' and British humor, and offers the entire cast the opportunity to create wholly credible characters. Perhaps 20-30 years ago this film would have been considered daring, but at this point in our cinematic history it seems rather tame!  Grady Harp, September 12",4,`This story is based on true facts.

Such practice was especially common in the treatment of female ""hysteria"" during the Victorian Era, as the point of such manipulation was to cause ""hysterical paroxysm"" in the patient. Not regarded as sexual in nature, the ailment was rampart and common and its treatment was time-consuming and hard work.One of the first vibrators was a steam-powered device called the ""Manipulator,"" which was created by American physician George Taylor. This machine was a rather awkward device, but was still heralded as some relief for the doctors who found themselves suffering from fatigued wrists and hands. Circa 1880, Dr. Joseph Mortimer Granville of London patented the first electromechanical vibrator. HYSTERIA, the film being reviewed, is the story of Dr. Granville's useful little device...with a few fictional flourishes.Although HYSTERIA is a farcical Victorian drama about the invention of the ""naughty"" vibrator....the movie is well portrayed.  Maggie Gyllenhaal and Hugh Darcy are the main characters dressed in proper Victorian garb spouting witty repartee. And there's additionally talented cast.When a society doctor named Dalyrumple (Jonathan Pryce) has an overflow of patients for treatment of ""hysteria,"" he engages an assistant (Hugh Darcy), an idealist young doctor named Joseph Mortimer Granville. Granville helps examine and treat female patients who lie on velvet-draped examining tables almost fully dressed wearing their hats.  (Some of the patients have cameo appearances and speeches in the film which are hysterical...pun intended.) Unfortunately, IYD sooner or later gets disabling cramps in his right hand...and his left hand is inadequate and useless.  After his dismissal, he discovers that his whacky roommate (Rupert Everett), who dabbles with electricity, has put together an electric feather duster.  The two fellows conspire, modify a feather duster, and patent the world's first electromechanical vibrator.Meanwhile, Dr Dalyrumple's free-spirited daughter (Gyllenhaal), who runs a tenement clinic and school in the slums of London, lands in jail for whacking a policeman on his head.  Dr. D. calls upon his former protege to provide witness at his daughter's trial: seems the only way to save her from jail for petty crime in those days is to diagnosis her with hysteria...and have her committed to an asylum for a hysterectomy... But young Dr. Mortimer has made a pile of money in royalties for his invention so he uses his money and influence to prevent pretty daughter from jail and a hysterectomy...Campy, campy...fun, fun...with a happily-ever-after ending!Enjoy,Jane",4,Electric feather duster becomes another useful little device...,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",2012,2751,"['According', 'Wikipedia', 'doctors', 'have', 'been', 'treating', 'women', 'centuries', 'wide', 'variety', 'illnesses', 'performing', 'pelvic', 'massage', 'stimulation', 'Such', 'practice', 'was', 'especially', 'common', 'treatment', 'female', 'hysteria', 'Victorian', 'Era', 'point', 'such', 'manipulation', 'was', 'cause', 'hysterical', 'paroxysm', 'patient', 'Not', 'regarded', 'sexual', 'nature', 'ailment', 'was', 'rampart', 'common', 'treatment', 'was', 'time-consuming', 'hard', 'work.One', 'first', 'vibrators', 'was', 'steam-powered', 'device', 'called', 'Manipulator', 'was', 'created', 'American', 'physician', 'George', 'Taylor', 'machine', 'was', 'rather', 'awkward', 'device', 'was', 'still', 'heralded', 'relief', 'doctors', 'who', 'found', 'suffering', 'fatigued', 'wrists', 'hands', 'Circa', '1880', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'Mortimer', 'Granville', 'London', 'patented', 'first', 'electromechanical', 'vibrator', 'HYSTERIA', 'film', 'being', 'reviewed', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Granville', 'useful', 'little', 'device', 'few', 'fictional', 'flourishes.Although', 'HYSTERIA', 'farcical', 'Victorian', 'drama', 'invention', 'naughty', 'vibrator', '.the', 'movie', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Maggie', 'Gyllenhaal', 'Hugh', 'Darcy', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'dressed', 'proper', 'Victorian', 'garb', 'spouting', 'witty', 'repartee', 'additionally', 'talented', 'cast.When', 'society', 'doctor', 'named', 'Dalyrumple', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'overflow', 'patients', 'treatment', 'hysteria', 'assistant', 'Hugh', 'Darcy', 'idealist', 'young', 'doctor', 'named', 'Joseph', 'Mortimer', 'Granville', 'Granville', 'examine', 'treat', 'female', 'patients', 'who', 'lie', 'velvet-draped', 'examining', 'tables', 'almost', 'fully', 'dressed', 'wearing', 'hats', 'patients', 'have', 'cameo', 'appearances', 'speeches', 'film', 'are', 'hysterical', 'pun', 'intended', 'Unfortunately', 'IYD', 'sooner', 'later', 'disabling', 'cramps', 'right', 'hand', 'left', 'hand', 'inadequate', 'useless', 'dismissal', 'whacky', 'roommate', 'Rupert', 'Everett', 'who', 'electricity', 'put', 'together', 'electric', 'feather', 'duster', 'two', 'fellows', 'conspire', 'modify', 'feather', 'duster', 'patent', 'world', 'first', 'electromechanical', 'vibrator.Meanwhile', 'Dr', 'Dalyrumple', 'free-spirited', 'daughter', 'Gyllenhaal', 'who', 'tenement', 'clinic', 'school', 'slums', 'London', 'jail', 'whacking', 'policeman', 'head', 'Dr.', 'D.', 'former', 'protege', 'provide', 'witness', 'daughter', 'trial', 'only', 'way', 'save', 'jail', 'petty', 'crime', 'days', 'diagnosis', 'hysteria', 'have', 'committed', 'asylum', 'hysterectomy', 'young', 'Dr.', 'Mortimer', 'made', 'pile', 'money', 'royalties', 'invention', 'so', 'money', 'influence', 'prevent', 'pretty', 'daughter', 'jail', 'hysterectomy', 'Campy', 'campy', 'fun', 'fun', 'happily-ever-after', 'ending', 'Enjoy', 'Jane']",N/A

The comedy is emphasized by the complete ignorance of male physicians about female physical experience and the prudish manners of the era.  Maggie Gyllenhaal seems atypical for a Victorian woman of the 1880's, but she's got such great spark and gusto that she serves the film well as she did in ""Don't Back Down.""  Hugh Dancy from ""Adam"" is such an unassuming but good-looking guy that he falls well into his part as the inventor of the vibrator.  Felicity Jones is so prim as Emily Dalrymple, that she is a perfect foil to Gyllenhaal's Charlotte, her character's sister.  The scenes where the doctors are bringing women to orgasm and terming it a ""medical treatment"" are hysterical, such as the opera singer hitting the high note as the electric powered vibrator proves its effectiveness.  Georgie Glen is delightful as the aging widow Mrs. Parsons who winds up with Jonathan Pryce's Dr. Dalrymple by the end of the film.  The DVD extras are also wonderful.  The interview sequence with Pryce, Dancy and director Tanya Wexler had me rolling in the aisles as they fielded wild questions about the film.  (I'll never think of a sandbag in quite the same way again!)  This film works incredibly well.  It was not the most high budget film ever, and certainly never played at our local cinema, but is great comic entertainment.

While that idea may bring titillating images, the ""patients"" remain clothed as Dr. Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) applies his deft touch.Overwhelmed with women seeking medical ""relief"" Dalrymple hires a young Dr. Granville (Hugh Dancy).  While this isn't Granville's idea of true medicine, he's enticed by Dalrymple's daughters and the fact that he needs a job.  Emily (Felicity Jones) is her father's clear favorite.  Like her father, she's prim and proper.  On the other hand, Charlotte (excellent Maggie Gyllenhaal) both older and more independent, causes grief for both her father and ultimately Granville.Granville's best friend, Edmund (Rupert Everett) is a constant tinkerer and inventor.  After weeks of use, Granville's right hand is showing wear and tear.  He tried using the left but it left the ladies uncured.  He starts to play around with a motorized feather duster Edmund had put together and with a few modifications tries it out on Dalrymple's maid, a former prostitute.  The rest is history.  Now a wealthy man, Granville is able to pursue his goal of practicing real modern medicine and goes after Charlotte, who he sees as a romantic and business partner.Directed by Tanya Wexler, the film is surprisingly reserved, given the ""R"" rating and the subject matter.  I suspect, the idea was to make it more humor-laden but it rarely works.  The actors do their jobs in fine fashion.

An invention with a surprising spark that turned on half the world. This movie isn&iexcl;t about what you think it&iexcl;s about. Just watch the trailer. Well, drat. Forget I said that. This movie is exactly what you think it&iexcl;s about. But wait! Don&iexcl;t let the sensitive nature of it fool you, because there&iexcl;s more here than ladybits and pleasure toys. Just trust me on this one, mmk?Set in the throes of a Victorian-era London, Dr. Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy) assists the ever-popular, Dr. Dalrymple, in treating women diagnosed with hysteria. With symptoms ranging from exhaustion and nervousness to cramps, depression and sexual frustration, just about every woman in London could be diagnosed with the malady! In an effort to find a better way to treat this ailment, Dr. Granville with a little help from his friend/benefactor, Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett), invents the first vibrator. And yes, there&iexcl;s also a love story thrown in for good measure as Dr. Dalrymple&iexcl;s two daughters (Maggie Gyllenhaal & Felicity Jones) battle to win Dr. Granville&iexcl;s attention and affection.Wexler was smart in her choice of casting, using underrated actors with a strong repertoire who could be funny without being kitschy. Gyllenhaal and Dancy had just the right amount of tension and chemistry needed to fuel their explosive onscreen relationship; Everett, as usual, pulled off class and charm with ease and Jones was prim and proper without falling into the category of &iexcl;stuffy.&iexcl; Gyllenhall was the total embodiment of female empowerment in this movie. See, women in 19th Century England suffered to no end and she fought to change all that, which is what I loved most about her. Though a bit extreme in her measures at times, she had passion and conviction. And that is why she stole the show. She was brilliant, simply brilliant.To be frank, Hysteria caught me by surprise. Upon first glance, this movie was nothing like what I expected it to be and that&iexcl;s a good thing. Given the rather risqu subject matter, it had all the potential to go too far. These days it&iexcl;s too easy venturing into crude territory using the gross-out humour to which we&iexcl;ve become accustom. But Wexler didn&iexcl;t do that. Instead, she took the high road and produced a smart and clever rom-com with sensibility and heart at its very core. Make no mistake, on the surface Hysteria is about a certain pleasurable device but it&iexcl;s also a story about progressive thinking, belief in change and love, and a funny one at that. The humour wasn&iexcl;t in-your-face or raunchy, instead Wexler settling on subtlety and wit. In the end, the characters facilitated change whether it be for themselves, the medical community or all of womenkind, and that folks, is a story I can jive to. More simply put&iexcl;I. LOVED. This. Film.Food for Thought: I adored this movie and it makes me sad that more people haven&iexcl;t heard of it.

1541629,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B008220A62,Paul Allaer,"[49, 51]","""Hysteria"" (95 min.) brings the highly unlikely (but we are reminded at the beginning of the film that ""This movie is based on true events. Really."") story of a young doctor Dr. Mortimer Granville (played by Hugh Dancy) in London, 1880, who is struggling but eventually finds a job with Dr. Robert Dalrymple (played brillantly by Jonathan Pryce) who is treating women for the so-called hysteria disease, really a catch-all for any and all things supposedly wrong with women in those days. The treatment is nothing else but to touch these women's private parts until they reach ""paroxysmal convulsions"" (wink, wink). The young doctor along with his buddy eventually come up with a mechanical device, which became the vibrator (still the number one sex toy in the world today, we are reminded at the end of the movie).But the movie in fact is much more about Granville's romantic interplay with the 2 daughters of Dalrymple, Emily (played by Felicity Jones), who is ""daddy's girl"" and to whom Granville gets engaged, and Charlotte (played by  Maggie Gyllenhaal), the ""rebel"" daughter who has set up a social center to help the poor. I don't want to give away much more from the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Maggie Gyllenhall really shines in this movie. I couldn't help but think how much she reminded me of Diane Keaton in her late 70s performances (think Annie Hall). That aside, this movie is a pleasant romcom, nothing more, nothing less.

1541631,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B008220A62,Peter Baklava,"[2, 3]","The subject of ""Hysteria"" is the peculiar relationship that Victorians had with their bodies.  As the film reveals, only a hundred fifty years ago medical professionals were divided as to whether diseases were created by germs, poor sanitation, or perhaps, ""bad air"".  Phrenology (reading health by the shape of bumps on the head) was in vogue.  Hysteria was a diagnosis given to women, so-called because it was thought to be seated in the womb.  Hypochondria was a separate condition originating in the solar plexus.Now, in 2011 we had two movies with titles relating to Victorian maladies, this one and ""Melancholia"".  Neither movie succeeded particularly well.""Hysteria"" reminded me quite a lot of ""The Road to Wellville"" (T. Coraghessan Boyle's creation), which was set in a spa run by the namesake of the Kellogg's Cereal dynasty.  Like ""Road..."", ""Hysteria"" is a farcical look at body functions and social mores.""Hysteria"" suffers from a believability deficit.  The movie asks you to believe that crowds of Victorian women would queue up to have themselves fondled intimately by their doctor.  Then it asks you to believe that an earnest young doctor would tear himself away from a hospital in order to give himself carpal tunnel syndrome as a partner in a 'fondling saloon'.I couldn't bring myself to accept that Victorians (particularly Victorian women) were anywhere close to being either so liberated or so frivolous. (SEE NOTE BELOW)The serious elements of the story, concerning Maggie Gyllenhaal's character and her crusades on behalf of the powerless, and her budding romance with the young doctor, were very arresting.  In fact, Gyllenhaal's performance as a sort of Florence Nightengale (echoing similar roles played by Emma Thompson) nearly saved the movie.  But at the end of viewing it, my only thought was that the actual story of the invention of the vibrator, unburdened by the silliness, might have been far more interesting than ""Hysteria"".Maybe next they can do a comedy about the 1950's, Wilhelm Reich and the ""orgone box"".NOTE:  Look at what physicians deal with today... they have to keep nurses in their offices in order to safeguard against claims of abuse.  Physicians must avoid the slightest perception that they are touching their patients improperly.  So, in regards to this movie... we viewers are supposed to believe that there was LESS opprobrium regarding impropriety and that females were LESS suspicious of male doctors and less protective of their privacy in Victorian times??

1541633,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B008220A62,PJR,"[2, 2]","I saw this differently from the first 32 reviewers. For me it was a light comedy, reasonably well done in that respect, about the history of medicine as late as the late 1800s. This theme was all over the place and square in your face. The only way to miss it was to focus on the vibrator part. In this respect, in getting history of medicine ideas across without being boring or overly serious, it was terrific.This was a transition time for long struggles in medicine as well as women's rights.This late in history it was still a fight to get doctors even to wash their hands and think about sanitary conditions. They were still using leeches to let blood. There were old fashioned medical ideas still very much in normal practice. The older doctor was encouraging his daughter to study phrenology and they called this science. The scientific and medical communities today are still trying to understand the realities of human sexuality, but back then the theories were absolutely absurd and discussion was even more difficult. And people's lives, including their sex lives, were being directed and controlled by the expert-informed society on the basis of absurd theories. The film is almost text-book on these facts. Yet it is a pleasant and entertaining film that viewers even without a sense of history should be able to enjoy. So I say three cheers and five stars.I was really glad for the extra features because they did provide a starting point for anyone who wants to do some reading and study on the issue of the vibrator and the lack of understanding of female sexuality then, and of course somewhat even today. I would suggest though that this should only be regarded as a start. I know a lot about this topic but there were a few facts presented in the special features that I would like to check out to verify, and anyone should. This is actually a big topic with lots of angles. If the film was an eye-opener for you, then the special features will be too. Then I suggest follow this up with some reading.

Just to be clear right from the start, although the movie is Rate R, there is no nudity and very little sexuality.  This movie barely rises to the level of titillating, much less erotic.  And to be fair, it is not TRYING to do this.Set in London in 1880, we're introduced to a very backwards medical society, where germs are still a ""crazy theory.""  And most women's problems, whether true mental health issues or simply general dissatisfaction (sexual or otherwise) are chalked up to a diagnosis of Hysteria.  We're introduced to a clinic, run by Jonathan Pryce, which is devoted to a cure for hysteria that involves the manual stimulation of women.  The women who can afford this treatment are eagerly lining up for it...they are essentially paying to receive stimulation they are not receiving from their husbands.  Remember, this is a time when the idea of a woman being aroused without direct input from their husbands is not believed.  Women are subject to ""hysteria"" not sexual frustration.Into this scene comes a charming young doctor (Hugh Dancy) whose good looks make the hysteria clinic even more popular.  And Dancy is introduced to Pryce's two daughters:  the seemingly proper and demur Felicity Jones and the rambunctious but charitable Maggie Gyllenhaal.  Not surprisingly in the least, he courts Jones but is drawn to Gyllenhaal.Poor Dr. Dancy begins to suffer from carpel tunnel with all the work he's doing with his wrist.  But he happens to be close friends with Rupert Everett, a rich guy with time to tinker with inventions.  The two men turn Everett's electric feather-duster into an electric stimulator.  From this invention, more plot complexities develop, which I shall not spoil.The movie's tone is that of light comedy, and the comedy is indeed light.  There are very few laugh out loud moments...this is a movie that generates smiles.  It is certainly harmless and good-natured.  The introduction of this new invention and the subsequent developments are certainly amusing.  On the other hand, we make no investment in the romance of the movie or even in the few moments of drama.  There is no heft to this film, no lasting impact.  It's a nice way to pass 99 minutes, and it's well designed, decorated and costumed.None of the actors are at their best either, because no one is asked to really do anything significant.  Dancy is generically charming and befuddled.  Pryce pretty much plays the character he's always asked to.  The two ladies are quite generic, because the script doesn't give them anything truly meaty to work with.  Gyllenhaal has lots of energy, but it often feels unsupported by circumstance...such as the scene where we first meet her raving around her father's waiting room.  She comes across like a crazy person with no propriety, rather than a passionate young lady with strong beliefs.  Most amusing in this film is Everett, who gets far too little work these days.  This role more or less reminded me of his existence, and he is so droll and funny that I yearn to see him in a meatier role again.HYSTERIA is amusing and thus, warrants a most modest recommendation.  But after writing this review, I will probably virtually forget all about it.  Certainly, don't let the subject matter fool you into thinking you're about to see something daring...far from it.

As his progressive attitudes to medicine often sets him at odds with some of less far sighted colleagues, still using their leeches and amputation methods. Well in a desperate attempt to put food on the table he approaches Dr. Robert Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce) who treats exclusively women of means who all suffer from 'hysteria', that is that they have been diagnosed with having a problematic womb, which means it needs constant attention through medically administered frottage in order to stop them going mental.Whilst this seems a bit daft, it was actually believed that `hysteria' that was too far gone would only be cured by a hysterectomy - and now you can see where the word comes from.  Anyway soon young Dr Granville is doing so well he develops `pleaseurers hand', that is cramp and has to be let go by Dr Dalrymple. This is a double blow as he had sort of fallen for the younger daughter and also was somewhat bemused by the older Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who has incurred her father's displeasure by working with the lower orders - the shame of it. All is not lost as Morton's bestest friend Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett) is an inventor and before you can say `change the batteries' they have stumbled across a vibrating thing that works as good as a hand or more so if you up the voltage.This is a Victorian rom com with electrical stimulus. It is really funny in places, Hugh Dancy out does Colin Firth a couple of times and there was a real chemistry between him and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Pryce is always good value - except where he does a duff accent like his Irish one in `Ronin'. Everett just plays himself with different clothes on and so manages to pull it off nicely too. The settings and period detail are all spot on too as you would expect; its 99 minutes long so perfectly timed and you don't have to think, hardly at all.

His new job involves ""medicinal massage"" for the women suffering from the symptom then commonly known as ""hysteria."" If you don't know what I am talking about, well, Dr. Granville is the man who patented the first electric vibrator.Despite its unique source material and late Victorian backdrop, ""Hysteria"" is first and foremost a romantic comedy about three likeable characters: Dr. Granville and Dr. Dalrymple's two daughters, free-spirited Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and obedient Emily (Felicity Jones). Such social and cultural movements as women's suffrage and telephone are mentioned but not explored.So which will the young doctor choose Emily (practicing phrenology) or Charlotte (riding a bicycle)? The story itself is a familiar one. It is not bad, just serviceable. But obviously the film is in need of a better story that can incorporate the interesting episode of first electric vibrator (that was, according to the film, originally invented for overtaxed physicians to treat their patients more speedily) into the romantic comedy storyline.The result is a fairly entertaining, if sometimes a bit awkward, romantic comedy free from preachy messages. The story is slick, if not told in a historically informative way, and with all these players who have turned in delightful performances, especially Rupert Everett and Sheridan Smith, ""Hysteria"" is a pleasant and amusing comedy.",4,(3.5 STARS) Victorian Romantic Comedy (about the First Electric Vibrator.

What I find most amusing is that the Victorians were so proper and prudish about so many things.

However, your doctor could bring you to a pleasurable experience and nothing would be thought wrong of it. Honestly, you have to see the humor in it all. Do women today visit their doctors to be stimulated for pleasure? He'd lose his license and probably end up behind bars. But here we are in the Victorian age, and doctors are actually bringing scores of women to a blissful experience, all in the name of medical treatment. The invention of the vibrator takes it even farther that a device was made to aid treatment at home. I see nothing morally wrong in the movie or disgusting. It's a historical fact that women had their uterus or ovaries removed to ""calm them down"" when treatment didn't work.

Before screening the film I asked students to leaveif they found the subject matter objectionable.  None left.Subsequently, five students filed complaints (which, incidentally, were typed by the chair--not the students themselves) and incorporated in a complaint against me for having been egregiously unprofessional.  Now mind you, this is material clearly pertinent to women's sexuality, which is a topic clearly within the purview of gender studies.  Still, these complaints found traction sufficient to suffer me three years of disciplinary action (an embarrassing investigation, no opportunity to teach, and the threat of six months of unpaid leave).  Thus, the first viewer above is absolutely correct when he says thatconservatives (sex negative viewers) are likely to find ""Hysteria"" offensive.  Moreover, it is possible--perhaps even probable--that action of one sort or another will be taken against the purveyors of such ""filth.""Incidentally, the complaints filed against me were at a state university where during that very same year a political science professor showed students explicit XXX photographs and erotica, for the purpose of delineating free speech boundaries. This is also a university where approximately six years ago two porno films were produced at one of our fraternities.In sum, this is an important film if for no other reason than it brings to light a procedure for treating a serious constellation of nonspecific, debilitating symptoms.  For the serious viewer, I also urge you to view the ""Passion and the Power"" and to read the fascinating book ""The Technology of Orgasm.""William T-M",5,Funny if not so tragic.,1339718400,"06 15, 2012",2012,1804,"['Three', 'years', 'ago', 'screened', 'Gender', 'Communication', 'students', 'documentary', 'Passion', 'Power', 'serious', 'history', 'development', 'use', 'vibrator', 'screening', 'film', 'asked', 'students', 'leaveif', 'found', 'subject', 'matter', 'objectionable', 'None', 'left.Subsequently', 'five', 'students', 'filed', 'complaints', 'incidentally', 'were', 'typed', 'chair', 'not', 'students', 'incorporated', 'complaint', 'having', 'been', 'egregiously', 'unprofessional', 'Now', 'material', 'clearly', 'pertinent', 'women', 'sexuality', 'topic', 'clearly', 'purview', 'gender', 'studies', 'Still', 'complaints', 'found', 'traction', 'sufficient', 'suffer', 'three', 'years', 'disciplinary', 'action', 'embarrassing', 'investigation', 'opportunity', 'teach', 'threat', 'six', 'months', 'unpaid', 'leave', 'Thus', 'first', 'viewer', 'absolutely', 'correct', 'when', 'thatconservatives', 'sex', 'negative', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'find', 'Hysteria', 'offensive', 'Moreover', 'possible', 'perhaps', 'even', 'probable', 'action', 'one', 'sort', 'will', 'be', 'taken', 'purveyors', 'such', 'filth', 'Incidentally', 'complaints', 'filed', 'were', 'state', 'university', 'where', 'very', 'same', 'year', 'political', 'science', 'professor', 'showed', 'students', 'explicit', 'XXX', 'photographs', 'erotica', 'purpose', 'delineating', 'free', 'speech', 'boundaries', 'also', 'university', 'where', 'approximately', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'two', 'porno', 'films', 'were', 'produced', 'one', 'fraternities.In', 'sum', 'important', 'film', 'other', 'reason', 'light', 'procedure', 'treating', 'serious', 'constellation', 'nonspecific', 'debilitating', 'symptoms', 'serious', 'viewer', 'also', 'urge', 'view', 'Passion', 'Power', 'read', 'fascinating', 'book', 'Technology', 'Orgasm', 'William', 'T-M']",N/A
