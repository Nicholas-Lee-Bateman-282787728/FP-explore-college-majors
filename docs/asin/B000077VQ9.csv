I had to run out and buy the 2nd part of the movie because I knew it would be better than the first. If u hasn't seen this movie then u should go and see it.

724628,A2YM2NM7YZA24Q,B000077VQ9,Haseeb,"[10, 11]","From the very beginning, this film grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go.  Although the film is quite predictable, it's still enjoyable to just watch and see exactly how certain events unfolded and who would be involved and in what capacity.From the beginning of the film, we know right away that a scheme is under way.  Most of the main characters seem to be people one would never imagine getting caught up in a scheme involving so much deceit and treachery.  The main character is a Psycologist (Mia) whose marriage is on the rocks.  Her main client is a woman who begins to council Mia more than she councils her however.  Mia is lead by her client into a web of treachery fueled by her failing marriage.  At a certain point in the film Mia considers the possibility of having intimate relations with two men at the same time.Although I really enjoyed this film, I think that it sends a very negative and troubling message and is biased towards women.  In the first ""Trois"", the ending was very fitting and sent a good strong message but the story was much weaker.  This film however, had much better scenes and a richer plot but the message it sent at the end was disturbing to say the least.  That's not to say that the film has no redeeming value however.  I liked the part in the film where the patient says to her Psycologist that she must look deep into herself before she can start to understand someone else.",4,"better than the first ""trois""",1064016000,"09 20, 2003",2003,1429,"['very', 'beginning', 'film', 'viewer', 'attention', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'film', 'quite', 'predictable', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'watch', 'see', 'exactly', 'how', 'certain', 'events', 'unfolded', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'involved', 'what', 'capacity.From', 'beginning', 'film', 'know', 'right', 'away', 'scheme', 'way', 'Most', 'main', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'people', 'one', 'would', 'never', 'imagine', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'scheme', 'involving', 'so', 'much', 'deceit', 'treachery', 'main', 'character', 'Psycologist', 'Mia', 'marriage', 'rocks', 'main', 'client', 'woman', 'who', 'council', 'Mia', 'more', 'however', 'Mia', 'lead', 'client', 'web', 'treachery', 'fueled', 'failing', 'marriage', 'certain', 'point', 'film', 'Mia', 'possibility', 'having', 'intimate', 'relations', 'two', 'men', 'same', 'time.Although', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'think', 'very', 'negative', 'troubling', 'message', 'biased', 'towards', 'women', 'first', 'Trois', 'ending', 'was', 'very', 'fitting', 'sent', 'good', 'strong', 'message', 'story', 'was', 'much', 'weaker', 'film', 'however', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'scenes', 'richer', 'plot', 'message', 'sent', 'end', 'was', 'disturbing', 'say', 'least', 'not', 'say', 'film', 'redeeming', 'value', 'however', 'liked', 'part', 'film', 'where', 'patient', 'Psycologist', 'must', 'look', 'deep', 'can', 'start', 'understand', 'someone', 'else']",N/A

724631,A3T23SHY3PASZ3,B000077VQ9,MissyK,"[14, 14]","The first Trois movie was one of those independent films and you could tell it was done on a budget and it was a first time directorial debut for those cats. So surprisingly, the 2nd Trois was up to par on so many levels: direction, acting, cinematography, plot, storyline, production. They did a great job with the second movie and I commend them on their efforts. It was all good and Pandora's Box delivered a suspenseful, erotic thriller with an all-black cast, who did their thing through the entire movie. It stars Monica Calhoun  (who played Mia in the Best Man and was LisaRaye's cousin in Playa's Club), Kristoff St.John (Neil on the Young&Restless;), Michael Jai White (he played in Spawn), and it also stars the lightskinneded thick chick from Playa's Club who played Ronnie (one of the girlz after Diamond).Anyway the movie was tastefully done, it had a great plot and it gave a positive portrayal of black women who are successful in their careers, sassy and sexy. The sex scenes were very passionate and the actors did an excellent job portraying their characters.Definitely a must-see. This definitely a movie for the ladies because the first was for the men. This time around the lead character has  a fantasy about 2 men and they are both fine as hell. Tyson Beckford has a small role in the beginning!!! The opening scenes are off the chain, it will immediately get your interest. The director's commentary was also good, which is available on the DVD version.",5,better than the first,1056672000,"06 27, 2003",2003,1477,"['first', 'Trois', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'independent', 'films', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'done', 'budget', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'directorial', 'debut', 'cats', 'So', 'surprisingly', '2nd', 'Trois', 'was', 'up', 'par', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'direction', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'plot', 'storyline', 'production', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'second', 'movie', 'commend', 'efforts', 'was', 'good', 'Pandora', 'Box', 'delivered', 'suspenseful', 'erotic', 'thriller', 'all-black', 'cast', 'who', 'did', 'thing', 'entire', 'movie', 'Monica', 'Calhoun', 'who', 'played', 'Mia', 'Best', 'Man', 'was', 'LisaRaye', 'cousin', 'Playa', 'Club', 'Kristoff', 'St.John', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Restless', 'Michael', 'Jai', 'White', 'played', 'Spawn', 'also', 'lightskinneded', 'thick', 'chick', 'Playa', 'Club', 'who', 'played', 'Ronnie', 'one', 'girlz', 'Diamond', '.Anyway', 'movie', 'was', 'tastefully', 'done', 'had', 'great', 'plot', 'gave', 'positive', 'portrayal', 'black', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'successful', 'careers', 'sassy', 'sexy', 'sex', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'passionate', 'actors', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'characters.Definitely', 'must-see', 'definitely', 'movie', 'ladies', 'first', 'was', 'men', 'time', 'lead', 'character', 'fantasy', '2', 'men', 'are', 'fine', 'hell', 'Tyson', 'Beckford', 'small', 'role', 'beginning', 'opening', 'scenes', 'are', 'chain', 'will', 'immediately', 'get', 'interest', 'director', 'commentary', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'available', 'DVD', 'version']",N/A
