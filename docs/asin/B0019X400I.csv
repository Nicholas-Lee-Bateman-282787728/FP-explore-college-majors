1164956,AGEIT17HENDIS,B0019X400I,Alfred Johnson,"[0, 1]","Sure lots of people on both sides of the Atlantic admired the pluck of the under-armed, under-manned, under- led British in holding up Hitler's plans for a while to conquer all of Europe and who knows where else. And everybody knows, who has thought about it for a while, that running a modern war machine requires more than having X number of battalions fully armed and mobile ready to fight on some god-forsaken front. Those two ideas combine (oh, yah, along with a little off-hand romantic interest this is after all a cinematic effort) to drive this film under review, The Small Back Room.Sammy (played in a manic-depressive manner as befits the character by David Farrah) is an explosives expert who, having done his bit at the front and taken a hit, a painfully bothersome artificial leg resulting, is now working his magic in the back rooms of the war establishment figuring out what will work and will not work in terms of military hardware. Of course all of this is tangled up with his pain, his attempts to deal with it through drugs and alcohol, his affair with his resolute stiff-upper lip girlfriend, Susan, (played by Kathleen Byron), who is forced to leave him as he attempts to hit bottom, military bureaucratic snafus, and other impediments to the war effort in order to turn the tide against the Germans.Oh yah, and to keep a little dramatic tension a little off-hand problem with booby-trapped bombs that the Germans keep dropping over the English countryside. Naturally Sammy, in his element then, has to have a go at defanging these dastardly instruments, does so successfully and receives a big boost to his self-esteem (and a small back room of his own).  Oh yah, as well, Susan comes back to him.

However, as in so many memories, this movie did not live up to expectations on re-watching.The plot drags terribly for most of the movie, with the David Farrar character feeling oh-so sorry for himself and his girlfriend inexplicably standing by him. Even in a peacetime movie this would be tiresome, but to have someone sitting more or less safely in London whining about his foot pain while so many fellow Brits were dying by the thousands is pretty annoying.The climactic bomb disposal scene is great, but it just hints at how good this movie *could* have been.The DVD extras are superb, with interviews with a cameraman and snippets from a biography that talk a lot about Powell & Pressburger and their other films.",2,"Nice DVD, the movie... not so much.",1310083200,"07 8, 2011",2011,805,"['had', 'seen', 'movie', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'available', 'DVD', 'However', 'so', 'many', 'memories', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'expectations', 're-watching.The', 'plot', 'terribly', 'most', 'movie', 'David', 'Farrar', 'character', 'feeling', 'oh-so', 'sorry', 'girlfriend', 'inexplicably', 'standing', 'Even', 'peacetime', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'tiresome', 'have', 'someone', 'sitting', 'more', 'less', 'safely', 'London', 'whining', 'foot', 'pain', 'so', 'many', 'fellow', 'Brits', 'were', 'dying', 'thousands', 'pretty', 'annoying.The', 'climactic', 'bomb', 'disposal', 'scene', 'great', 'just', 'hints', 'how', 'good', 'movie', '*could*', 'have', 'been.The', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'superb', 'interviews', 'cameraman', 'snippets', 'biography', 'lot', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'other', 'films']",N/A
1164959,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B0019X400I,C. O. DeRiemer,"[24, 28]","Sammy Rice (David Farrar) is a first-rate scientist and something of an expert in defusing bombs. The year is 1943 and the Germans have starting dropping a new kind of terror weapon on Britain. It's something small, evidently attractive to children, and explodes either when it's picked up or just touched. No one is sure because the three children and one adult who did touch the things were killed. Rice is asked to investigate by the Army. He says he has to have an unexploded device to work on; that he'll come as soon as the Army calls him. Rice, it happens, has also lost his foot and wears a metal one. He suffers pain from it and is well into a self-pitying meltdown fueled by alcohol. Susan (Kathleen Byron), the woman who loves him, understands what he's going through but sooner or later will have enough of his self-involvement. ""Sue, you'd have such a good life without me,"" he tells her in a nightclub. ""I take things from you with both hands. I always have. I always will.""Sammy Rice has to deal with his self-imposed isolation, his drinking and his unwillingness to face up to the fact that he has an artificial foot. Through all this, the group of scientists and managers Rice works with has come up with an anti-tank gun some feel is ready to sell to the government. He doesn't, but he's not willing to go against the consensus. Then, deep in an alcoholic haze, he gets the phone call. Two devices have been discovered. One is now being worked on by the Army captain who first asked him to help. It probably goes without saying that soon there is no Army captain and only one remaining device. Rice leaves for the English coast where the device is half buried in the sand. What he does with it will determine not only his life, but will affect his whole outlook on himself, his worth and his willingness to accept responsibility.Sound a little...well, too much? The Small Back Room features some very good acting, excellent dialogue, one of Michael Powell's quirky internal surrealistic scenes (as Rice fights his compulsion to have a drink) and an extremely well-handled and tense final twenty-five minutes as Rice works to defuse the bomb. On the whole, though, it seems to me that Powell and Pressburger, after such a run of great movies they created in the Forties, used The Small Back Room as a way to step back and let out a long breath. The movie is by no means a let-down, but the sulky self-pity of Sammy Rice leaves little room for us to get willingly involved with him. This is a problem because the movie, despite an exciting premise with the new-type of German bomb and the excitement of the last third of the film, is essentially a character study in Rice's self-pity. Sammy Rice starts out gloomy and unhappy, and he stays that way throughout the movie until he walks across the sand to see if he can defuse the bomb. Powell and Pressburger's subversive humor (a dolt of a governmental minister, a glad-handing arms manager) is amusing but we still wind up with Rice feeling sorry for himself.I think it's fair to say that The Small Back Room marks the coming decline of Powell and Pressburger. The Tales of Hoffmann was still to be made, but with that exception every movie following The Small Back Room marked a decline in the kind of original, unusual cinematic storytelling that was the hallmark of The Archers. They had to deal with studio moneymen who gradually assumed control over the freedom that they had enjoyed with J. Arthur Rank and Alexander Korda. They, especially Powell, found it increasingly difficult to find subject matter that excited them. At one point, four years elapsed before they took on a new project. The Archers last movie turned out to be something Powell swore he'd never make after all those Quota Quickies in the Thirties, a programmer. They drifted apart, still friends, and went their own ways.For those who admire Powell and Pressburger, The Small Back Room is well worth having. In addition to Farrar and Byron, both of whom were in Black Narcissus, there are a number of fine actors to enjoy, such as Jack Hawkins, Cyril Cusack, Sid James, Leslie Banks, Michael Gough, Robert Morley and Renee Asherson.This Criterion release has an excellent DVD transfer. I only sampled the extras, which include a booklet essay, a commentary, a video interview with Christopher Challis who worked with Powell and Pressburger on several of their movies, and an audio excerpt of Powell's dictations for his autobiography. If you haven't bought the two volumes yet, I think you'll findA Life in Movies: An AutobiographyandMillion Dollar Moviegreat reading.Thank goodness for DVD and for Criterion. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger are no more, but we have their greatest films still with us. Says Challis, ""It was a great team and I'm terribly sorry it packed up.""",4,"The Archers in decline, but still a film worth watching",1214352000,"06 25, 2008",2008,4824,"['Sammy', 'Rice', 'David', 'Farrar', 'first-rate', 'scientist', 'something', 'expert', 'defusing', 'bombs', 'year', '1943', 'Germans', 'have', 'starting', 'dropping', 'new', 'kind', 'terror', 'weapon', 'Britain', 'something', 'small', 'evidently', 'attractive', 'children', 'explodes', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'just', 'touched', 'one', 'sure', 'three', 'children', 'one', 'adult', 'who', 'did', 'touch', 'things', 'were', 'killed', 'Rice', 'asked', 'investigate', 'Army', 'have', 'unexploded', 'device', 'work', ""'ll"", 'come', 'as', 'soon', 'Army', 'Rice', 'also', 'lost', 'foot', 'metal', 'one', 'pain', 'well', 'self-pitying', 'meltdown', 'fueled', 'alcohol', 'Susan', 'Kathleen', 'Byron', 'woman', 'who', 'what', 'going', 'sooner', 'later', 'will', 'have', 'enough', 'self-involvement', 'Sue', ""'d"", 'have', 'such', 'good', 'life', 'nightclub', 'take', 'things', 'hands', 'always', 'have', 'always', 'will', 'Sammy', 'Rice', 'deal', 'self-imposed', 'isolation', 'drinking', 'unwillingness', 'face', 'up', 'fact', 'artificial', 'foot', 'group', 'scientists', 'managers', 'Rice', 'works', 'come', 'up', 'anti-tank', 'gun', 'feel', 'ready', 'sell', 'government', ""n't"", 'not', 'willing', 'go', 'consensus', 'Then', 'deep', 'alcoholic', 'haze', 'phone', 'call', 'Two', 'devices', 'have', 'been', 'discovered', 'One', 'now', 'being', 'worked', 'Army', 'captain', 'who', 'first', 'asked', 'help', 'probably', 'saying', 'soon', 'Army', 'captain', 'only', 'one', 'remaining', 'device', 'Rice', 'English', 'coast', 'where', 'device', 'half', 'buried', 'sand', 'What', 'will', 'determine', 'not', 'only', 'life', 'will', 'affect', 'whole', 'outlook', 'worth', 'willingness', 'accept', 'responsibility.Sound', 'little', 'well', 'too', 'much', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'excellent', 'dialogue', 'one', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'quirky', 'internal', 'surrealistic', 'scenes', 'Rice', 'fights', 'compulsion', 'have', 'drink', 'extremely', 'well-handled', 'tense', 'final', 'twenty-five', 'minutes', 'Rice', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'whole', 'though', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'run', 'great', 'movies', 'created', 'Forties', 'used', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'way', 'step', 'back', 'let', 'out', 'long', 'breath', 'movie', 'means', 'let-down', 'sulky', 'self-pity', 'Sammy', 'Rice', 'little', 'room', 'get', 'willingly', 'involved', 'problem', 'movie', 'exciting', 'premise', 'new-type', 'German', 'bomb', 'excitement', 'last', 'third', 'film', 'essentially', 'character', 'study', 'Rice', 'self-pity', 'Sammy', 'Rice', 'out', 'gloomy', 'unhappy', 'way', 'movie', 'sand', 'see', 'can', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'subversive', 'humor', 'dolt', 'governmental', 'minister', 'glad-handing', 'arms', 'manager', 'amusing', 'still', 'wind', 'up', 'Rice', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'himself.I', 'think', 'fair', 'say', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'coming', 'decline', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'Tales', 'Hoffmann', 'was', 'still', 'be', 'made', 'exception', 'movie', 'following', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'marked', 'decline', 'kind', 'original', 'unusual', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'was', 'hallmark', 'Archers', 'had', 'deal', 'studio', 'moneymen', 'who', 'gradually', 'assumed', 'control', 'freedom', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'J.', 'Arthur', 'Rank', 'Alexander', 'Korda', 'especially', 'Powell', 'found', 'increasingly', 'difficult', 'find', 'subject', 'matter', 'excited', 'one', 'point', 'four', 'years', 'elapsed', 'took', 'new', 'project', 'Archers', 'last', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'something', 'Powell', 'swore', ""'d"", 'never', 'make', 'Quota', 'Quickies', 'Thirties', 'programmer', 'drifted', 'apart', 'still', 'went', 'own', 'ways.For', 'who', 'admire', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'well', 'worth', 'having', 'addition', 'Farrar', 'Byron', 'whom', 'were', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'are', 'number', 'fine', 'actors', 'enjoy', 'such', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'Cyril', 'Cusack', 'Sid', 'James', 'Leslie', 'Banks', 'Michael', 'Gough', 'Robert', 'Morley', 'Renee', 'Asherson.This', 'Criterion', 'release', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'only', 'sampled', 'extras', 'include', 'booklet', 'essay', 'commentary', 'video', 'interview', 'Christopher', 'Challis', 'who', 'worked', 'Powell', 'Pressburger', 'several', 'movies', 'audio', 'excerpt', 'Powell', 'dictations', 'autobiography', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'two', 'volumes', 'yet', 'think', ""'ll"", 'findA', 'Life', 'Movies', 'AutobiographyandMillion', 'Dollar', 'Moviegreat', 'reading.Thank', 'goodness', 'DVD', 'Criterion', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'Emeric', 'Pressburger', 'are', 'more', 'have', 'greatest', 'films', 'still', 'Challis', 'was', 'great', 'team', ""'m"", 'terribly', 'sorry', 'packed', 'up']",N/A

(There is no scene of such an explosion; a scene with a killed boy's mother and his witnessing very young brother was deleted due to time considerations.) Farrar and his Army associate then rush to a location where a soldier is dying from his encounter with another explosive device, to ask him whether he picked it up by the end or the middle. (No need to show this explosion, just attend to the dying youth trying to speak.) Some time later the Army associate finds two more of these mysterious objects on a pebbly beach and phones Farrar to come quickly. The Army associate perishes trying to defuse device #1. (This explosion is not shown, but reported on when Farrar arrives at the site.) Farrar gets a grip on himself and goes alone to device #2 to do or die.

Several new scenes (cut from the TV version) really helped to flesh out the movie; the reminiscences of cameraman Christopher Challis (taped in 2008) and director Michael Powell were an extra bonus.The restored scenes were mainly on the inter-departmental turf wars that stood in the way of the scientific war effort.  Protagonists included the end-users of the scientific weaponry (the military), the academic scientists who thought they were still at university, and the paper-pushing civil servants...not to forget the politicians who liked grandstanding.Anyone who looks closely into the modern push for ""renewable energy"" will recognise this sort of pattern, with the place of the military being taken by the consumers in their struggle to maintain a decent standard of living.Of course the main theme of the movie is the overcoming of a personal adversity -- somehow it has the same flavour as ""The King's Speech"" although not so grand.",5,Power struggle,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",2012,1155,"['20', 'years', 'ago', 'taped', 'movie', 'TV', 'mea', 'culpa', 'quite', 'liked', 'Recently', 'paid', 'hard', 'cash', 'Criterion', 'version', 'was', 'very', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'sound', 'vision', 'quality', 'were', 'excellent', 'Several', 'new', 'scenes', 'cut', 'TV', 'version', 'really', 'helped', 'flesh', 'out', 'movie', 'reminiscences', 'cameraman', 'Christopher', 'Challis', 'taped', '2008', 'director', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'were', 'extra', 'bonus.The', 'restored', 'scenes', 'were', 'mainly', 'inter-departmental', 'turf', 'wars', 'stood', 'way', 'scientific', 'war', 'effort', 'Protagonists', 'included', 'end-users', 'scientific', 'weaponry', 'military', 'academic', 'scientists', 'who', 'thought', 'were', 'still', 'university', 'paper-pushing', 'civil', 'servants', 'not', 'forget', 'politicians', 'who', 'liked', 'grandstanding.Anyone', 'who', 'closely', 'modern', 'push', 'renewable', 'energy', 'will', 'recognise', 'sort', 'pattern', 'place', 'military', 'being', 'taken', 'consumers', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'decent', 'standard', 'living.Of', 'course', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'overcoming', 'personal', 'adversity', 'somehow', 'same', 'flavour', 'King', 'Speech', 'not', 'so', 'grand']",N/A
1164962,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0019X400I,Miles D. Moore,"[30, 31]","It was a surprise for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger to follow up the Technicolor extravaganzas of ""Black Narcissus"" and ""The Red Shoes"" with a throwback to their earlier work--the black-and-white, tightly focused World War II drama ""The Small Back Room."" Perhaps the film served as sort of a palate cleanser before they moved on to ""The Tales of Hoffmann,"" a film so rococo that it made ""The Red Shoes"" look modest. However, ""The Small Back Room"" is still a riveting, superbly made, character-driven thriller that is worth anyone's time.Set in the early spring of 1943, the film tells the story of Sammy Rice, a bomb expert sinking into drink and despair after a failed effort to defuse a bomb caused one of his feet to be blown off, leaving him in constant agony. In his depression, Sammy is allowing the political players in his government department (led by a smarmy Jack Hawkins) to walk all over him, to the sorrow and anger of Susan, Sammy's secretary and live-in girlfriend.  Whether Sammy can sufficiently regain his confidence to save his job and his relationship with Susan is the crux of the story, which ends with a palm-sweatingly suspenseful sequence involving a German UXB on an English beach.Powell and Pressburger brought virtually the entire crew from ""The Red Shoes"" over to ""The Small Back Room,"" including production designer Hein Heckroth and composer Brian Easdale, and their artistry pays off. So does the artistry of Christopher Challis--a camera operator on ""The Red Shoes,"" promoted to director of photography here--who provides B&W; photography of uncommon clarity, depth and beauty. Above all, ""The Small Back Room"" is a wonderful showcase for the talents of David Farrar and Kathleen Byron, who were brilliant in ""Black Narcissus"" and equally fine here. Farrar's moody, bitter Sammy isn't all that different from ""Black Narcissus's"" Mr. Dean, but Byron's sane, kind-hearted Susan is a 180-degree turn from the crazed Sister Ruth of ""Black Narcissus."" The brilliance and variety that Byron demonstrated in these two roles makes it all the more tragic that she never achieved true stardom, as she deserved to do. But at least audiences will always have her performances in ""Black Narcissus"" and ""The Small Back Room"" as testimony to her radiant screen presence.",5,"Powell and Pressburger, returning to their roots.",1220227200,"09 1, 2008",2008,2297,"['was', 'surprise', 'Michael', 'Powell', 'Emeric', 'Pressburger', 'follow', 'up', 'Technicolor', 'extravaganzas', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'throwback', 'earlier', 'work', 'black-and-white', 'tightly', 'focused', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'drama', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'Perhaps', 'film', 'served', 'sort', 'palate', 'cleanser', 'moved', 'Tales', 'Hoffmann', 'film', 'so', 'made', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'look', 'modest', 'However', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'still', 'riveting', 'superbly', 'made', 'character-driven', 'thriller', 'anyone', 'time.Set', 'early', 'spring', '1943', 'film', 'story', 'Sammy', 'Rice', 'bomb', 'expert', 'sinking', 'drink', 'despair', 'failed', 'effort', 'defuse', 'bomb', 'caused', 'one', 'feet', 'be', 'blown', 'off', 'leaving', 'constant', 'agony', 'depression', 'Sammy', 'allowing', 'political', 'players', 'government', 'department', 'led', 'smarmy', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'walk', 'sorrow', 'anger', 'Susan', 'Sammy', 'secretary', 'live-in', 'girlfriend', 'Sammy', 'can', 'sufficiently', 'regain', 'confidence', 'save', 'job', 'relationship', 'Susan', 'crux', 'story', 'palm-sweatingly', 'suspenseful', 'sequence', 'involving', 'German', 'UXB', 'English', 'beach.Powell', 'Pressburger', 'brought', 'virtually', 'entire', 'crew', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'including', 'production', 'designer', 'Hein', 'Heckroth', 'composer', 'Brian', 'Easdale', 'artistry', 'off', 'So', 'artistry', 'Christopher', 'Challis', 'camera', 'operator', 'Red', 'Shoes', 'promoted', 'director', 'photography', 'here', 'who', 'B', 'W', 'photography', 'uncommon', 'clarity', 'depth', 'beauty', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'wonderful', 'showcase', 'talents', 'David', 'Farrar', 'Kathleen', 'Byron', 'who', 'were', 'brilliant', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'equally', 'fine', 'here', 'Farrar', 'moody', 'bitter', 'Sammy', ""n't"", 'different', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'Mr.', 'Dean', 'Byron', 'sane', 'kind-hearted', 'Susan', '180-degree', 'turn', 'crazed', 'Sister', 'Ruth', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'brilliance', 'variety', 'Byron', 'demonstrated', 'two', 'roles', 'more', 'tragic', 'never', 'achieved', 'true', 'stardom', 'deserved', 'do', 'least', 'audiences', 'will', 'always', 'have', 'performances', 'Black', 'Narcissus', 'Small', 'Back', 'Room', 'testimony', 'radiant', 'screen', 'presence']",N/A
