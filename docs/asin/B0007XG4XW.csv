893940,A38WHB3IPOX3XR,B0007XG4XW,"E. Parkinson ""Film & Book VIP""","[12, 14]","""DELIVERING MILO"" is one of those rare finds on DVD, which delivers far more entertainment value than the promise of its eye-catching packaging.  Featuring an impressive all-star cast, this film re-invents the ""It's A Wonderful Life"" concept by introducing the concept of a heavenly order to all child births.  When young Milo refuses to be born, the divine balance is disturbed and no other children anywhere on the planet can be born until the order is restored.  To remedy this dilemma, an errant angel-in-training is called upon, portrayed splendidly by the always affable Albert Finney.  His mission is to take Milo to Earth and convince him (within 24 hours) that life truly is wonderful and that he wants to be born.  Milo's parents (played by Bridget Fonda and Campbell Scott) are superb, as are great supporting roles from Lesley Ann Warren (""Desperate Housewives"") and Alison Lohman (""Matchstick Men"").  But the surprise-star of the show is young Anton Yelchin as Milo, a thoroughly likable and curiously conflicted child.  You can count on seeing Anton Yelchin emerge as one of the next generation's leading young men.  ""DELIVERING MILO"" was shot in 2001 (there's an establishing shot of New York City, showing the World Trade Center);  but disputes over the film's production and distribution rights kept this gem ""on the shelf"" for the past four years while the parties worked out their differences.  I noticed that the primary logo is from LAKESHORE ENTERTAINMENT, the respected international production and distribution outfit behind other wonderful films, including last year's Oscar winning ""Million Dollar Baby.""  If you want a great DVD experience (whether purchasing or renting), ""DELIVERING MILO"" is an absolute keeper!",5,"Superb ""discovery"" of an enchanting, award-winning film!!!",1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1740,"['DELIVERING', 'MILO', 'one', 'rare', 'finds', 'DVD', 'far', 'more', 'entertainment', 'value', 'promise', 'eye-catching', 'packaging', 'Featuring', 'impressive', 'all-star', 'cast', 'film', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'concept', 'introducing', 'concept', 'heavenly', 'order', 'child', 'births', 'When', 'young', 'Milo', 'be', 'born', 'divine', 'balance', 'disturbed', 'other', 'children', 'anywhere', 'planet', 'can', 'be', 'born', 'order', 'restored', 'remedy', 'dilemma', 'errant', 'angel-in-training', 'called', 'upon', 'portrayed', 'splendidly', 'always', 'affable', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'mission', 'take', 'Milo', 'Earth', 'convince', '24', 'hours', 'life', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'be', 'born', 'Milo', 'parents', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'great', 'supporting', 'roles', 'Lesley', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'Alison', 'Lohman', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'surprise-star', 'show', 'young', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'Milo', 'thoroughly', 'likable', 'curiously', 'conflicted', 'child', 'can', 'count', 'seeing', 'Anton', 'Yelchin', 'emerge', 'one', 'next', 'generation', 'leading', 'young', 'men', 'DELIVERING', 'MILO', 'was', 'shot', '2001', 'establishing', 'shot', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'showing', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'film', 'production', 'distribution', 'rights', 'kept', 'gem', 'shelf', 'past', 'four', 'years', 'parties', 'worked', 'out', 'differences', 'noticed', 'primary', 'logo', 'LAKESHORE', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'respected', 'international', 'production', 'distribution', 'outfit', 'other', 'wonderful', 'films', 'including', 'last', 'year', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'want', 'great', 'DVD', 'experience', 'purchasing', 'renting', 'DELIVERING', 'MILO', 'absolute', 'keeper']",N/A

893942,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B0007XG4XW,Nicholas Carroll,"[19, 20]","I never even heard of this film until this month when my Spiritual Cinema Circle subscription featured this film in its November 2005 mail-out. For those who don't know, Spiritual Cinema Circle is a mail distribution service where members get a dvd each month that includes 3 short films and one feature film of spiritually inspiring content. They bring little known films into your home and I haven't been disappointed yet.Anyhow, in the film ""Singles"", Campbell Scott's character and Bridget Fonda's character agree that while their relationship as a couple didn't work, that they were probably a ""scorching couple in another universe."" Well, once again they team up as a couple for this film. I'm a big fan of Bridget Fonda and try to see all of her works. She's made a lot of movies, but most of the roles haven't been high-profile as they were in the early 90s. In this film, she really shines as a pregnant wife who still carries the pain of having a father walk out on her at a young age.The spiritual aspect of this film revolves around Milo, a card-playing boy who doesn't want to leave heaven for a lifetime on earth. His refusal to go when his time comes up has catacalysmic effect on the earth, so the board members who determine birth cycles enlist the help of a cantankerous old man serving time in hell for a lifetime of carnal desires. He has one day to convince Milo to be born. What ensues is a romp through Manhattan, hitting all the sights/activities that children tend to enjoy. Albert Finney as the old man is hilarious and reminds me of Jackie Gleason. He's thinking more about himself than the boy, so when he crosses paths with an old flame, played by Leslie Ann Warren (everything I've seen her in, she plays a floozie who can't stop giggling), they take a trip to Atlantic City for some adult fun of gambling.By the time the film reaches resolution, we see the connection and purpose for everything, and it reaches a surprising yet satisfying conclusion. One thing I particularly enjoyed in this film were the members of the board...essentially kids acting grown-up, one of them an African American speaking with a very snobby-type of accent, which is done for humorous effect. I love how they keep the old man on the mission everytime he gets distracted by the ladies.So, give this film a chance. I have no idea why it didn't get a wide release. It was supposedly released in 2001, and seeing New York with the World Trade Center, I don't know if that was an issue post 9/11, but if that's the case, it was a wrong decision. We could've used an inspiring comedy with spiritual elements to help us through our shock, grief, and trauma of that horrible day and the dark weeks after. This film will inspire you and maybe even give you something to think about regarding the children who choose to be born to you.",5,A spiritually uplifting film that should have had a wider release,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2837,"['never', 'even', 'heard', 'film', 'month', 'when', 'Spiritual', 'Cinema', 'Circle', 'subscription', 'featured', 'film', 'November', '2005', 'mail-out', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Spiritual', 'Cinema', 'Circle', 'mail', 'distribution', 'service', 'where', 'members', 'get', 'dvd', 'month', '3', 'short', 'films', 'one', 'feature', 'film', 'spiritually', 'inspiring', 'content', 'bring', 'little', 'known', 'films', 'home', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'disappointed', 'yet.Anyhow', 'film', 'Singles', 'Campbell', 'Scott', 'character', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'character', 'agree', 'relationship', 'couple', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'were', 'probably', 'scorching', 'couple', 'universe', 'Well', 'once', 'again', 'team', 'up', 'couple', 'film', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'try', 'see', 'works', 'made', 'lot', 'movies', 'most', 'roles', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'high-profile', 'were', 'early', '90s', 'film', 'really', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'who', 'still', 'pain', 'having', 'father', 'walk', 'young', 'age.The', 'spiritual', 'aspect', 'film', 'Milo', 'card-playing', 'boy', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'heaven', 'lifetime', 'earth', 'refusal', 'go', 'when', 'time', 'up', 'catacalysmic', 'effect', 'earth', 'board', 'members', 'who', 'determine', 'birth', 'cycles', 'enlist', 'help', 'cantankerous', 'old', 'man', 'serving', 'time', 'hell', 'lifetime', 'carnal', 'desires', 'one', 'day', 'convince', 'Milo', 'be', 'born', 'What', 'romp', 'Manhattan', 'hitting', 'sights/activities', 'children', 'tend', 'enjoy', 'Albert', 'Finney', 'old', 'man', 'hilarious', 'Jackie', 'Gleason', 'thinking', 'more', 'boy', 'so', 'when', 'paths', 'old', 'flame', 'played', 'Leslie', 'Ann', 'Warren', 'everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'floozie', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stop', 'giggling', 'take', 'trip', 'Atlantic', 'City', 'adult', 'fun', 'gambling.By', 'time', 'film', 'resolution', 'see', 'connection', 'purpose', 'everything', 'surprising', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'One', 'thing', 'particularly', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'were', 'members', 'board', 'essentially', 'kids', 'acting', 'grown-up', 'one', 'African', 'American', 'speaking', 'very', 'snobby-type', 'accent', 'done', 'humorous', 'effect', 'love', 'how', 'keep', 'old', 'man', 'mission', 'everytime', 'distracted', 'ladies.So', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'wide', 'release', 'was', 'supposedly', 'released', '2001', 'seeing', 'New', 'York', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'issue', 'post', '9/11', 'case', 'was', 'wrong', 'decision', 'could', ""'ve"", 'used', 'inspiring', 'comedy', 'spiritual', 'elements', 'help', 'shock', 'grief', 'trauma', 'horrible', 'day', 'dark', 'weeks', 'film', 'will', 'inspire', 'maybe', 'even', 'give', 'something', 'think', 'regarding', 'children', 'who', 'choose', 'be', 'born']",N/A
