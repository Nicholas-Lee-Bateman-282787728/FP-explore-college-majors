1423027,A27TQA0XCZUXZY,B004OKSHFC,Feles31,"[1, 1]","I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Cons:  Warm up was too long --- I prefer a few stretches and lunges and want to move on.  Rather choppy camera work with sudden zooms, some odd transition moments, and room audio equipment or something awkwardly showing in edge of frame.  I could barely hear the music.  I barely broke a sweat.  The moves contained more dance-y moves (like grapevines) than other workouts by this instructor.  I prefer athletic moves to dance-y moves, largely because these dance-y type moves usually incorporated in cardio workouts will never get me in my target heart rate zone.  Those moves that were tougher were way too short and I barely started working when it was over.  The non cardio segments were good but since this is called a weight loss cardio mix with that being the longest segment, I give the cardio the most weight.  I'm not sure what kind of target level this workout was for but the ""bust out of your weight loss plateau"" had me thinking it would be tough so I was disappointed.Pros:  I have most of this instructor's other workouts --- as always, likable with decent cuing.  Prefer the trio setup where there is instructor with low impact and advanced modifiers but instructor alone was ok.  Overall film quality was decent.  Background waterfall nice to look at and not too distracting.  The non-cardio segments were good.  I would recommend this for beginners working their way up.",3,not sure of target level,1305676800,"05 18, 2011",2011,1443,"['consider', 'intermediate', 'level', 'fitness.Cons', 'Warm', 'up', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'prefer', 'few', 'stretches', 'lunges', 'want', 'move', 'Rather', 'choppy', 'camera', 'work', 'sudden', 'zooms', 'odd', 'transition', 'moments', 'room', 'audio', 'equipment', 'something', 'awkwardly', 'showing', 'edge', 'frame', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'music', 'barely', 'broke', 'sweat', 'moves', 'contained', 'more', 'dance-y', 'moves', 'grapevines', 'other', 'workouts', 'instructor', 'prefer', 'athletic', 'moves', 'dance-y', 'moves', 'largely', 'dance-y', 'type', 'moves', 'usually', 'incorporated', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'target', 'heart', 'rate', 'zone', 'moves', 'were', 'tougher', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'barely', 'started', 'working', 'when', 'was', 'over', 'non', 'cardio', 'segments', 'were', 'good', 'called', 'weight', 'loss', 'cardio', 'mix', 'being', 'longest', 'segment', 'give', 'cardio', 'most', 'weight', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'kind', 'target', 'level', 'workout', 'was', 'bust', 'weight', 'loss', 'plateau', 'had', 'thinking', 'would', 'be', 'tough', 'so', 'was', 'disappointed.Pros', 'have', 'most', 'instructor', 'other', 'workouts', 'always', 'likable', 'decent', 'cuing', 'Prefer', 'trio', 'setup', 'where', 'instructor', 'low', 'impact', 'advanced', 'modifiers', 'instructor', 'alone', 'was', 'ok', 'Overall', 'film', 'quality', 'was', 'decent', 'Background', 'waterfall', 'nice', 'look', 'not', 'too', 'distracting', 'non-cardio', 'segments', 'were', 'good', 'would', 'recommend', 'beginners', 'working', 'way']",N/A

You are moving around the entire time and not just moving in one place. This a good example of an intermediate workout. It is paced enough so that you can finish the workout. I was surprised how much I sweated from the 40 minute cardio portion.

I consider myself pretty coordinated and had no problem with most of the DVD.  She does have one part about 30 minutes into the cardio where the steps are confusing, but I just kept moving until I could get back into the rhythm.  I wore a heart rate monitor and burned almost 600 calories in 45 minutes. Very pleased with that.  Not too crazy about the toning section, but the cardio was fun and fast.  She is by herself on this workout and I like that.

1423030,A3NDHGTMTCGO7Z,B004OKSHFC,L. McHugh,"[2, 2]","This is an excellent workout by Jessica Smith who is like my personal trainer! I love her workouts and alternate between her and Amy Dixon. I don't love cardio, but at middle age (almost 50) I need it and this helps with the pooch around the middle that women get in middle age. Jessica uses a lot of compound toning moves which help make the workout more efficient. I never go wrong buying her workouts and also recommend the 10 pounds down toning DVD. I sometimes have to fight to get workouts in with a job I commute to and 3 teenagers and 3 dogs.

1423032,A16HOB9S21O6PW,B004OKSHFC,S. Rutigliano,"[5, 6]","10 Pounds Down: Weight Loss Cardio Mix with Jessica  SmithGreetings everyone. I wanted to take a moment and tell you about the fabulous new workout series by one of my all time favorite fitness instructors. Jessica Smith has created a new series called 10 Pounds down. There are two dvds in this collection. There is is Weight Loss Cardio Mix and Total Body Tune up.Weight Loss Cardio Mix is essentially a perfect workout. The dvd includes a warm, cardio workout, toning section, ab section and a cool down.  There is no equiptment needed for this workout. The workout is filmed in a nice open studio with a waterfall fountain in the background. Its a one on one with just you and Jessica. I definitely prefer this set up over having various people that you have to focus on. It gets distracting and I usually find myself concentrating more on what everyone is doing differently instead of focusing on my own mind/muscle connection.I really can't say enough good things about this workout. The Ab work, the planks, the creative floor work that she does where you literally nail several muscle groups at once using only your body weight. Its amazing. Your abs, tricpes, butt and arms are going to be screaming for mercy when you are done doing this DVD.  I can tell you that personally I have always found cardio to be the worst part of working out. I can not do the ""endless walk to no where"" on the treadmill or endless eliptical work. There isn't enough money in the world to inpire me to get my sweat on. Jessica herself told me that this workout was ""cardio disguised at strength training"" and I agree with that statement completely. This workout gets your heart rate up and gets you moving while changing what you are doing constantly and keeping you engaged. This workout is built set up in such a way that it is very challenging yet not impossible, Jessica offers several ways to increase the difficulty of each move so that in the future when you get stronger you can be more challenged. These modifications are pretty awesome. I tried the ones she suggested during several of the moves and thought I was going to cry.  Jessica is one of my favorite fitness instructors of all time. I own every single one of her workout dvds and not one of them dissapoints. Jessica's teaching style makes you want to do your best because you want to make her proud. She is out there on the floor red in the face and sweating with you while still being your cheerleader. She wants to see you succeed and she truly believes you can. The positivity that exudes during her workouts is palpable and you really pick up on it. Jessica is not some obnoxious instructor who was born with a perfect size 0  body and has no idea what you are going through in your struggles there at home. She knows first hand from her own battle with weight loss. Let her be story be your inspiration and get out there and sweat your butt off with her. I can tell you that through this workout you are guaranteed to shed pounds and have great toned muscles. Do this 4-5 days a week as she suggests. Try increasing the difficulty through her modifications and stick to it.  So buy this DVD, and buy a copy for your best friend while you are at it. Don't let Jessica down!",5,Prepare to see your body change,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,3236,"['10', 'Pounds', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Mix', 'Jessica', 'SmithGreetings', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'take', 'moment', 'tell', 'fabulous', 'new', 'workout', 'series', 'one', 'time', 'favorite', 'fitness', 'instructors', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'created', 'new', 'series', 'called', '10', 'Pounds', 'down', 'are', 'two', 'dvds', 'collection', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Mix', 'Total', 'Body', 'Tune', 'up.Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Mix', 'essentially', 'perfect', 'workout', 'dvd', 'warm', 'cardio', 'workout', 'toning', 'section', 'ab', 'section', 'cool', 'down', 'equiptment', 'needed', 'workout', 'workout', 'filmed', 'nice', 'open', 'studio', 'waterfall', 'fountain', 'background', 'one', 'one', 'just', 'Jessica', 'definitely', 'prefer', 'set', 'up', 'having', 'various', 'people', 'have', 'focus', 'distracting', 'usually', 'find', 'concentrating', 'more', 'what', 'everyone', 'doing', 'differently', 'instead', 'focusing', 'own', 'mind/muscle', 'connection.I', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'workout', 'Ab', 'work', 'planks', 'creative', 'floor', 'work', 'where', 'literally', 'nail', 'several', 'muscle', 'groups', 'once', 'using', 'only', 'body', 'weight', 'amazing', 'abs', 'tricpes', 'butt', 'arms', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'screaming', 'mercy', 'when', 'are', 'done', 'doing', 'DVD', 'can', 'tell', 'personally', 'have', 'always', 'found', 'cardio', 'be', 'worst', 'part', 'working', 'out', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'endless', 'walk', 'where', 'treadmill', 'endless', 'eliptical', 'work', ""n't"", 'enough', 'money', 'world', 'inpire', 'get', 'sweat', 'Jessica', 'told', 'workout', 'was', 'cardio', 'disguised', 'strength', 'training', 'agree', 'statement', 'completely', 'workout', 'heart', 'rate', 'moving', 'changing', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'constantly', 'keeping', 'engaged', 'workout', 'built', 'set', 'up', 'such', 'way', 'very', 'challenging', 'yet', 'not', 'impossible', 'Jessica', 'several', 'ways', 'increase', 'difficulty', 'move', 'so', 'future', 'when', 'get', 'stronger', 'can', 'be', 'more', 'challenged', 'modifications', 'are', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'tried', 'ones', 'suggested', 'several', 'moves', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'cry', 'Jessica', 'one', 'favorite', 'fitness', 'instructors', 'time', 'own', 'single', 'one', 'workout', 'dvds', 'not', 'one', 'dissapoints', 'Jessica', 'teaching', 'style', 'want', 'do', 'best', 'want', 'make', 'proud', 'out', 'there', 'floor', 'red', 'face', 'sweating', 'while', 'still', 'being', 'cheerleader', 'see', 'succeed', 'truly', 'can', 'positivity', 'workouts', 'palpable', 'really', 'pick', 'up', 'Jessica', 'not', 'obnoxious', 'instructor', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'perfect', 'size', '0', 'body', 'idea', 'what', 'are', 'going', 'struggles', 'there', 'home', 'first', 'hand', 'own', 'battle', 'weight', 'loss', 'Let', 'be', 'story', 'be', 'inspiration', 'get', 'there', 'sweat', 'butt', 'off', 'can', 'tell', 'workout', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'shed', 'pounds', 'have', 'great', 'toned', 'muscles', 'Do', '4-5', 'days', 'week', 'Try', 'increasing', 'difficulty', 'modifications', 'stick', 'So', 'buy', 'DVD', 'buy', 'copy', 'best', 'friend', 'are', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'Jessica', 'down']",N/A
