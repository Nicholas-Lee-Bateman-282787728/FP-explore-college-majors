This is the animated version of Macaulay's excellent book of the same name, and as with on-screen adaptations of Cathedral, Pyramid, and the difficult to find Roman City, the film rotates between Macaulay's real life visits to a number of existing sites, in this case Edward I's castles in Wales, and the animated story of the construction of the featured structure from the book. Not only is it fun to see this masterful writer and illustrator actually walking through and explaining how these mega-structures were erected using hand tools and pack animals, but the plotline of the building of the impregnable fortress of Aberwyvern, and its testing in a violent siege during a Welsh ""revolt"" (I like to think of it as an act of liberation, since the English were in these Celts' country, after all) should still engross those with even the most flighty of attention spans. Personally I love Medieval castles and the gritty if much-maligned era that produced them, and this video brings back a flood of personal memories of this book and video, but even those with no past connection to Macaulay's classic works should find a lot here on this DVD that's plainly and simply great.",5,The Golden Age Of The Castle,1178755200,"05 10, 2007",2007,1396,"['Castle', 'back', 'have', 'say', 'program', 'as', 'good', 'today', 'least', 'twenty', 'viewings', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'used', 'watch', 'copy', 'dad', 'taped', 'off', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'back', '80', 'animated', 'version', 'Macaulay', 'excellent', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'on-screen', 'adaptations', 'Cathedral', 'Pyramid', 'difficult', 'find', 'Roman', 'City', 'film', 'Macaulay', 'real', 'life', 'visits', 'number', 'existing', 'sites', 'case', 'Edward', 'castles', 'Wales', 'animated', 'story', 'construction', 'featured', 'structure', 'book', 'Not', 'only', 'fun', 'see', 'masterful', 'writer', 'illustrator', 'actually', 'walking', 'explaining', 'how', 'mega-structures', 'were', 'erected', 'using', 'hand', 'tools', 'pack', 'animals', 'plotline', 'building', 'impregnable', 'fortress', 'Aberwyvern', 'testing', 'violent', 'siege', 'Welsh', 'revolt', 'like', 'think', 'act', 'liberation', 'English', 'were', 'Celts', 'country', 'should', 'still', 'engross', 'even', 'most', 'flighty', 'attention', 'spans', 'Personally', 'love', 'Medieval', 'castles', 'gritty', 'much-maligned', 'era', 'produced', 'video', 'back', 'flood', 'personal', 'memories', 'book', 'video', 'even', 'past', 'connection', 'Macaulay', 'classic', 'works', 'should', 'find', 'lot', 'here', 'DVD', 'plainly', 'simply', 'great']",N/A

But the reality of castles and the people inside them is explored in David Macaulay's ""Castle,"" in which we get a cartoon about the building and function of a medieval Welsh castle, even as Macaulay explains to us what a murder hole is.Macaulay and Sarah Bullen explain in detail how the castles functioned, whether in war or in day-to-day life -- they explore the architecture, the use of castles in defense (including how they kept enemies out), the purpose of a castle for the people living around it, and the evolution of the castle from simple fenced earthen mounds into the giant stone citadels they became.And they explore the often-unknown aspects of medieval life, ranging from the funny (medieval table manners, including ""Don't spit over the table"") to the grim (you would probably die young, single and poor).Intercutting between these scholarly lectures is the tale of Sir Kevin the Strange (snicker), an English noble who begins building the ultimate castle on a Welsh bluff overlooking the sea. People begin flocking to the down of Aberwyvern, creating a bustling local economy as the castle is whipped together in record time.But soon after Aberwyvern Castle is completed, the king pays a visit to tell Sir Kevin that the Welsh will soon attack, and this one castle will apparently be the first place that Prince Dafyd's army will attack. Aberwyvern Castle was build to stand up to any assault, but is it strong enough stand up to the assault?""Castle"" does a very, very good job enlightening people about what medieval castles -- and medieval life -- were all about, rather the the romanticized fairy-tale depictions we're familiar with. It's pretty fascinating to get even brief glimpses of how people actually lived back then (people called dibs on houses near the wells... and far from the slaughterhouse).The only problem is that the Welsh ""rebels"" are depicted in a somewhat villainous way, until the very last scene. I don't know why Prince Dafyd was animated in a sort of villainous way, when you consider that this was HIS homeland, and the English are trying to control it.And to really root this all in reality, most of the live-action documentary stuff is narrated to us in actual castles. Granted, these castles aren't in tip-top condition (they're a bit crumbly), but they do give us a good idea of how these buildings actually look and feel in real life -- and with a bit of imagination, you can picture what they must have looked like in their prime.For fans of all things medieval and/or architectural, ""Castle"" is an enlightening, easily-understood look into these unique buildings and the people who made them.",4,Story of a castle,1306886400,"06 1, 2011",2011,2761,"['Everybody', 'medieval', 'life', 'castles', 'turrets', 'banners', 'physics-defying', 'giant', 'rooms', 'floor', 'reality', 'castles', 'people', 'explored', 'David', 'Macaulay', 'Castle', 'get', 'cartoon', 'building', 'function', 'medieval', 'Welsh', 'castle', 'even', 'Macaulay', 'what', 'murder', 'hole', 'is.Macaulay', 'Sarah', 'Bullen', 'explain', 'detail', 'how', 'castles', 'functioned', 'war', 'day-to-day', 'life', 'explore', 'architecture', 'use', 'castles', 'defense', 'including', 'how', 'kept', 'enemies', 'out', 'purpose', 'castle', 'people', 'living', 'evolution', 'castle', 'simple', 'fenced', 'earthen', 'mounds', 'giant', 'stone', 'citadels', 'became.And', 'explore', 'often-unknown', 'aspects', 'medieval', 'life', 'ranging', 'funny', 'medieval', 'table', 'manners', 'including', 'Do', ""n't"", 'spit', 'table', 'grim', 'would', 'probably', 'die', 'young', 'single', 'poor', '.Intercutting', 'scholarly', 'lectures', 'tale', 'Sir', 'Kevin', 'Strange', 'snicker', 'English', 'noble', 'who', 'building', 'ultimate', 'castle', 'Welsh', 'bluff', 'overlooking', 'sea', 'People', 'begin', 'flocking', 'down', 'Aberwyvern', 'creating', 'bustling', 'local', 'economy', 'castle', 'whipped', 'together', 'record', 'time.But', 'soon', 'Aberwyvern', 'Castle', 'completed', 'king', 'visit', 'tell', 'Sir', 'Kevin', 'Welsh', 'will', 'soon', 'attack', 'one', 'castle', 'will', 'apparently', 'be', 'first', 'place', 'Prince', 'Dafyd', 'army', 'will', 'attack', 'Aberwyvern', 'Castle', 'was', 'build', 'stand', 'up', 'assault', 'strong', 'enough', 'stand', 'up', 'assault', 'Castle', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'enlightening', 'people', 'what', 'medieval', 'castles', 'medieval', 'life', 'were', 'rather', 'romanticized', 'fairy-tale', 'depictions', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'pretty', 'fascinating', 'get', 'even', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'how', 'people', 'actually', 'lived', 'back', 'then', 'people', 'called', 'dibs', 'houses', 'wells', 'far', 'slaughterhouse', 'only', 'problem', 'Welsh', 'rebels', 'are', 'depicted', 'somewhat', 'villainous', 'way', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Prince', 'Dafyd', 'was', 'animated', 'sort', 'villainous', 'way', 'when', 'consider', 'was', 'HIS', 'homeland', 'English', 'are', 'trying', 'control', 'it.And', 'really', 'root', 'reality', 'most', 'live-action', 'documentary', 'stuff', 'narrated', 'actual', 'castles', 'Granted', 'castles', 'are', ""n't"", 'tip-top', 'condition', ""'re"", 'bit', 'crumbly', 'do', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'buildings', 'actually', 'look', 'feel', 'real', 'life', 'bit', 'imagination', 'can', 'picture', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'looked', 'prime.For', 'fans', 'things', 'medieval', 'and/or', 'architectural', 'Castle', 'enlightening', 'easily-understood', 'look', 'unique', 'buildings', 'people', 'who', 'made']",N/A

Macaulay's genius is to clearly explain the construction and uses of complex structures like cathedrals, castles, or pyramids in a series of finely detailed drawings.  His videos are a wonderful mix of live action and animation that are difficult to forget.Castle is the story of an imaginary castle in Wales built by the English under Edward I in the 13th century.  The animated segments depict the castle's construction, the lives of its builders and inhabitants, and the uses to which it was put, most vividly in a siege by the Welsh who were trying to drive out the English invaders.  The animation is clear and very beautiful, with some touches of humor (my students always enjoyed seeing the garde robes, for example!).  In the live action segments Macaulay shows us around some of the surviving Welsh castles, explaining how they were constructed and the purposes behind them.

The live action features author David Macaulay along with Sarah Bullen (presumably someone known in the UK) as they tour several castles in Wales, explaining how they were built.The animation shows the building of a fictional castle, including an interesting story showing the type of people who would have been involved in the building of an actual medieval Welsh castle.

499865,A357QW4JERASV1,B00000FAHO,Jonhayashi1,"[0, 0]","A long time ago, I recorded the PBS broadcasts of David Macaulay's 55min. specials entitled, Cathedrals, Pyramid, Roman City. Each of them had an interesting mix of educational live action and dramatic hand drawn animation. Most of these specials had animation made over seas with the possible exception of Roman City. Actor Derik Jacobi(I CLAUDIUS) voiced central  characters in most of these specials. Animation depicting the ancient past has always attracted me and here animated graphics are used to explain how the castle's defenses work to protect it's residents. Well detailed drawn animation of the fictional castle characters such as SIR Kevin who owns the fortress and his wife the Lady Katherine, give a good idea of how the british lived in these buildings while dealing with the Welsh people who hated the British invading their land! One gets to see the different points of view of both the Prince of Wales trying to break through the castle's defenses and Sir Kevin keeping the Welsh from driving the British out of the Welsh's homeland! Dramatic detailed battle animated action is well combined with clear simple animated diagrams of how the waring strategies work! Both voice performances and colourful cell animation are well brought together in this hour long special. In between the animated sequences, Mr. Macaulay talks to us the viewer and shows us a standing ruin of an existing castle and he showed both the house of the poor lower class at the time of the middle ages as well as the dinner table of the rich castle occupants. He also talked about castle life with a fellow expert on middle age castle warfare. And the animation showed that as the village the castle protected grew the hostilities of the British and welsh ceased to exist and the castle became neglected and was no longer used. Maybe I will copy my VHS recordings of Pyramid, Cathedral and Roman City onto DVD to preserve them so they will be on DVD too! It would have been better for this special to have been remastered for brighter colour but I turn up the colour on my TV set for this Dvd to look good on my set and the results are satisfying.
