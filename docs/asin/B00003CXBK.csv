I is a serious film, with a complex plot that may require multiple viewings to understand. The story revolves around Ashitaka, a man with a cursed arm who searches for its' source, and a possible cure, before it kills him. He finds himself trying to pacify the relationships between 3 separate groups all fighting for the same cut of land and a fourth using the conflict to their own ends. Each character is so multidimensional that it becomes difficult to classify any as heroes and villains (except Ashitaka, who is definitely a hero) they're simply human. Yes even the forest spirits. this is a story of moral ambiguity, human advancement versus nature, the seduction of greed, and redemption. Also, I usually don't like love stories in movies because they seem to just make for subplots that fill space, but the love story here is fantastic, an odd Romeo and Juliet story that adds a very large depth to the story and characters. The Animation? Perfect. I can't say much more that that, it is seamless, gorgeous to look at, it is a Miyazaki film, we should expect it. Overall this is a great film, not necessarily something for kids (scary images and massive amounts of blood)but something everyone should try to see at least once in their life.",5,The greatest animated movie of all time,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1378,"['should', ""n't"", 'have', 'explain', 'much', 'title', 'just', 'Now', 'not', 'whimsical', 'light', 'hearted', 'song-and', '-dance', 'film', 'serious', 'film', 'complex', 'plot', 'may', 'require', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'understand', 'story', 'Ashitaka', 'man', 'cursed', 'arm', 'who', 'source', 'possible', 'cure', 'trying', 'pacify', 'relationships', '3', 'separate', 'groups', 'fighting', 'same', 'cut', 'land', 'fourth', 'using', 'conflict', 'own', 'ends', 'character', 'so', 'multidimensional', 'difficult', 'classify', 'heroes', 'villains', 'Ashitaka', 'who', 'definitely', 'hero', ""'re"", 'simply', 'human', 'Yes', 'even', 'forest', 'spirits', 'story', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'human', 'advancement', 'versus', 'nature', 'seduction', 'greed', 'redemption', 'Also', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'love', 'stories', 'movies', 'seem', 'just', 'make', 'subplots', 'fill', 'space', 'love', 'story', 'here', 'fantastic', 'odd', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'story', 'very', 'large', 'depth', 'story', 'characters', 'Animation', 'Perfect', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'more', 'seamless', 'gorgeous', 'look', 'Miyazaki', 'film', 'should', 'expect', 'Overall', 'great', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'something', 'kids', 'scary', 'images', 'massive', 'amounts', 'blood', 'something', 'everyone', 'should', 'try', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'life']",Princess Mononoke

521908,A1OT7DSRMJ8PSK,B00003CXBK,ACD,"[0, 0]","It is hard to pin down Princess Mononoke with a simple review. For its time, it was a very ground breaking anime. Though it wasn&#8217;t advertised much, it ended up assisting in changing Americans perception of anime and allowed more people to be receiving of this genre and paved the way for Miyazaki's movie to be showed on the big screen in Hollywood a few short years later (and ultimately win an Oscar)Princess Mononoke isn't just a whimsical child's story. The themes are much deeper, and Miyazaki in his brilliance uses the conduit of anime to deliver a much meaningful overtone to the viewer. It isn't so much about good versus evil, but rather survival of the fittest and coexistence of man and nature. While new industry may be conceived through good intentions, it doesn't render the fact that it can still be dangerous and harmful. We see this in Princess Mononoke through the lens of several groups of people simply trying to survive what they consider to be a threat, even if its at the expense of another. Through its fanciful tale it brings us face to face with the reality there is a growing rift between man and nature in our ever changing world. While man adapts and grows, nature stays relatively constant and thus creates conflict. Miyazaki explores this through his motion picture, and in nearly all of his subsequent films.Princess Mononoke is truly an iconic piece of cinema. The art and animation is something even Walt Disney himself was envious of. It easily ensnares you in the reality of what's happening within the story. Whether or not you like anime, you should not pass up a chance to watch this film at least once.

521913,A3CDG6F1JKU0W1,B00003CXBK,Alanna Evans,"[7, 7]","Yes its a masterpiece, but it has its flaws.  The storyline doesn't flow as coherently as I had hoped, its a little disjointed in places, with a few moments which were a bit slow and tedious, but the brilliant animation was enough to make up for it.  The themes of nature vs. human progress (on the brink of an industrial revolution here) is frighteningly similiar to reality, only our forests on earth do not have animal spirit-gods to protect them.  Their leader is a girl who believes herself to be a wolf - who is of course Princess Mononoke, raised by wolves and befriended by the wolfgods, she is the link between the human race and the mysteries of the forest.  There is the bad guy (in this case a woman), Lady Eboshi, who is spookily similiar to the antagonist in Hayao Miyazaki's other work, the spectacular &quot;Nausicaa&quot; (or &quot;Warriors of the Wind&quot; as was its title in the US). In fact, the whole movie is like a modern (or less modern) retelling of Nausicaa with a few new trappings.  The enviromentalist themes are all intact only this time there's no demon summoning, although a few boars get turned into them.Which leads me to a point.  I know ALOT of people in the United States especially are not familiar with anime tend to believe that animation = children fare.  Well this is not the case, anime is generally slanted for an adult audience, most often in very extreme cases, with R rated themes.  They are basically hard core sci fi or fantasy but set with moving drawings instead of live action.  The PG-13 rating is there for a reason.  This movie is violent, it is bloody, there are boars with their flesh rotting off, beheadings and other acts of violence.  But its not gratitious, there is reason behind it, this movie attempts to make many points on many levels and instead of just talking about it often gives us the visual images to go along with the message. It's entirely necessary and even made me a little queasy at times, but was more than worth it.  Children 12+ should be able to handle it if they are mature enough, although just the ideas of animals turning into demons by their inner hatred can be confusing, again its making a point that violence is not the way to go and that problems can be solved with other ways than falling back on the savage core of the living - which is hate.Of special note is Ashitaka's steed, a gazelle, who moves with such fluidity and grace, that everytime they take the screen together, I can't take my eyes off of them.  It's gorgeous watching it leap and bound across the screen, very well done.Overall &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; comes highly recommended as a landmark in Japanese animation, however falls under the bar that was set by &quot;Nausicaa&quot; back in the 1980s.  Few movies have managed to eclipse that one in general but it still stands as the best of Miyazaki's work.  Anime fans have probably already seen it and loved it but parents beware that start to reach for the film based on Miyazaki's kid's fare like the often annoying &quot;Totoro&quot; and the sweet witch's fantasy &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot;, that this is particular flick takes a much more mature direction and the real anime fans are thankful for it.",4,Not quite Nausicaa but...,974851200,"11 22, 2000",2000,3230,"['Yes', 'masterpiece', 'flaws', 'storyline', ""n't"", 'flow', 'as', 'coherently', 'had', 'hoped', 'little', 'disjointed', 'places', 'few', 'moments', 'were', 'bit', 'slow', 'tedious', 'brilliant', 'animation', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'themes', 'nature', 'vs.', 'human', 'progress', 'brink', 'industrial', 'revolution', 'here', 'frighteningly', 'similiar', 'reality', 'only', 'forests', 'earth', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'animal', 'spirit-gods', 'protect', 'leader', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'wolf', 'who', 'course', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'raised', 'wolves', 'befriended', 'wolfgods', 'link', 'human', 'race', 'mysteries', 'forest', 'bad', 'guy', 'case', 'woman', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'who', 'spookily', 'similiar', 'antagonist', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'other', 'work', 'spectacular', 'quot', 'Nausicaa', 'quot', 'quot', 'Warriors', 'Wind', 'quot', 'was', 'title', 'US', 'fact', 'whole', 'movie', 'modern', 'less', 'modern', 'retelling', 'Nausicaa', 'few', 'new', 'trappings', 'enviromentalist', 'themes', 'are', 'intact', 'only', 'time', 'demon', 'summoning', 'few', 'boars', 'get', 'turned', 'them.Which', 'point', 'know', 'ALOT', 'people', 'United', 'States', 'especially', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'anime', 'tend', 'believe', 'animation', 'children', 'fare', 'Well', 'not', 'case', 'anime', 'generally', 'slanted', 'adult', 'audience', 'most', 'often', 'very', 'extreme', 'cases', 'R', 'rated', 'themes', 'are', 'basically', 'hard', 'core', 'sci', 'fi', 'fantasy', 'set', 'moving', 'drawings', 'instead', 'live', 'action', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'there', 'reason', 'movie', 'violent', 'bloody', 'are', 'boars', 'flesh', 'rotting', 'off', 'beheadings', 'other', 'acts', 'violence', 'not', 'gratitious', 'reason', 'movie', 'make', 'many', 'points', 'many', 'levels', 'instead', 'just', 'talking', 'often', 'visual', 'images', 'go', 'along', 'message', 'entirely', 'necessary', 'even', 'made', 'little', 'queasy', 'times', 'was', 'more', 'Children', '12+', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'are', 'mature', 'enough', 'just', 'ideas', 'animals', 'turning', 'demons', 'inner', 'hatred', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'again', 'making', 'point', 'violence', 'not', 'way', 'go', 'problems', 'can', 'be', 'solved', 'other', 'ways', 'falling', 'back', 'savage', 'core', 'living', 'hate.Of', 'special', 'note', 'Ashitaka', 'steed', 'gazelle', 'who', 'such', 'fluidity', 'grace', 'take', 'screen', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', 'gorgeous', 'watching', 'leap', 'bound', 'screen', 'very', 'well', 'done.Overall', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'quot', 'highly', 'recommended', 'landmark', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'however', 'bar', 'was', 'set', 'quot', 'Nausicaa', 'quot', 'back', '1980s', 'Few', 'movies', 'have', 'managed', 'eclipse', 'one', 'general', 'still', 'best', 'Miyazaki', 'work', 'Anime', 'fans', 'have', 'probably', 'already', 'seen', 'loved', 'parents', 'beware', 'start', 'reach', 'film', 'based', 'Miyazaki', 'kid', 'fare', 'often', 'annoying', 'quot', 'Totoro', 'quot', 'sweet', 'witch', 'fantasy', 'quot', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'quot', 'particular', 'flick', 'much', 'more', 'mature', 'direction', 'real', 'anime', 'fans', 'are', 'thankful']",Princess Mononoke

Set in Midevil Japan, A boy named Ashitaka is the last prince of an almost completeley wiped out tribe. When killing a demon god from harming his vilage, he is cursed. He himself will turn into a demon. So he is forced to leave his village and seek out the spirit of the forest. One thing you should know is that all the animals have the power to talk. But if the spirit of the forest is killed, the animals become stupid, as they are today. Ashitaka journeys through a forest and finds two wounded men. He safely transports them to their village of iron town, where he finds the leader to be a woman. Lady Iboshi. The town is always at war with the animals because there is iron in the forest and they are after it. The only way to get it is to cut down the forest and this makes the animals mad. On top of this, the wolves have a human daughter. Princess of the wolves. She enters the village to attack Lady Iboshi, but Ashitaka stops her. He flees with the Princess, but he was shot. Realizing that he is on her side, she takes him to the enchanted part of the forest where the spirit lives. The spirit heals his flesh wound, but does not lift the curse. When the big battle happens against the boars and the humans, the boars loose. One of the boar gods begins to turn into a demon. Princess Mononoke tries to stop it and it begins to change her too. Whats worse is that Lady Iboshi is on her way to kill the spirit of the forest. Ashitaka has to stop it in time and save himself and Mononoke from the curse. The soundtrack is also great.

Even though there is some violence, the main themes of the movie are love, support and kindness.3) Music. The music for this movie is composed by the acclaimed Japanese composer Joe Hisaishi. Based on the score for this movie, Joe Hisaishi released a separate symphonic suite. The main theme of the movie is a popular hit in Japan; it is being played or sung by various artists.I can watch this movie several times, as I like quality of animation, the story and the music.

521928,A2K3L0DOPQQ697,B00003CXBK,"Andrew Olson ""otaku""","[3, 3]","This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war. The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards. The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance. But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance. The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy. The story is not easy to understand. It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore. And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted. Japanese television documented a lot of the production. The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work). Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that. His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute. There is no other animation like it. This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",5,another amazing anime,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",2006,2699,"['be', 'Miyazake', 'most', 'personal', 'work', 'clearly', 'serious', 'design', 'set', 'imaginary', 'time', 'time', 'ancient', 'gods', 'Shinto', 'style', 'gods', 'place', 'nature', 'settlement', 'humans', 'coming', 'metalworking', 'war', 'world', 'not', 'balance', 'distant', 'conflict', 'industry', 'nature', 'wounded', 'one', 'gods', 'forest', 'then', 'killed', 'sentry', 'boy', 'farmland', 'evil', 'controlling', 'transfers', 'beginning', 'slow', 'takeover', 'must', 'journey', 'origin', 'conflict', 'find', 'way', 'cure', 'incidentally', 'will', 'learn', 'try', 'restore', 'balance', 'not', 'simplistic', 'tale', 'are', 'other', 'characters', 'play', 'good', 'evil', 'everyone', 'easy', 'balance', 'Princess', 'Hime', 'story', 'mysterious', 'human', 'who', 'been', 'raised', 'wolves', 'are', 'powerful', 'forest', 'gods', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'Amerindian', 'Coyote', 'myth', 'who', 'ally', 'enemy', 'story', 'not', 'easy', 'understand', 'many', 'Japanese', 'mythic', 'elements', 'even', 'then', 'work', 'Miyazake', 'unique', 'imagination', 'not', 'intended', 'be', 'simple', 'have', 'clean', 'resolution.The', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'unusual', 'new', 'elements', 'even', 'Miyazake', 'new', 'departure', 'style', 'can', 'see', 'continued', 'next', 'film', 'Sen', 'Chihiro', 'more', 'nature', 'more', 'wild', 'more', 'jamming', 'elements', 'Japanese', 'myth', 'folklore', 'continuing', 'trend', 'be', 'more', 'personal', 'concerned', 'ethics', 'character', 'less', 'sci-fi', 'are', 'least', 'dozen', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'threaded', 'story', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'displaying', 'subtle', 'character.The', 'original', 'Japanese', 'soundtrack', 'amazing', 'singing', 'best', 'talent', 'available', 'voices', 'Japan', 'Miyazake', 'universally', 'known', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'Japanese', 'television', 'documented', 'lot', 'production', 'English', 'translation', 'drew', 'good', 'talent', 'seem', 'not', 'have', 'gotten', 'quite', 'so', 'intensely', 'Japanese', 'crew.If', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Miyazake', 'give', 'try', 'maybe', 'look', 'Sen', 'Chihiro', 'first', 'even', 'Laputa', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'easier', 'lighter', 'introduction', 'work', 'say', 'Japanese', 'Disney', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'work', 'depth', 'sophistication', 'Disney', 'cute', 'other', 'animation', 'truly', 'adult', 'work', 'children', 'might', 'like', 'visuals', 'doubt', 'many', 'kids', 'teen', 'age', 'will', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'even', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'more', 'time', 'see', 'again']",Princess Mononoke

Much of it is trashy, silly, sexually overt rubbish targeting sexually deprived teenage males. I can see why many people steer clear from anything classified as anime. I urge any potential view with these concerns to open your mind and watch this film.If I could only recommend one Japanese animated film this would definately be it. Hayao Miyazaki is often referred to as the Japanese Walt Disney. If you see his other films (which are all excellent) you can see why, however this film does not fit that role.Princess Mononoke despite it's fairy-tale-like sounding name is definately not targeting a younger audience. This movie is for adults.

Those blithely seeking cartoon pabulum will be shocked and offended. But if you are looking for provocative intelligent adult anime, then Princess Mononoke is like a sea wind blowing away the saccharine smog that smothers western animation.For one thing, it has no villains. This will confuse childish minds conditioned to expect not only good and bad in every movie, but to have the bad guys clearly labelled with black hats, scars and ugly sneers. For another, it doesn't hide its ambivalence with technology or its respect for nature. In fact, that is its thesis: how we lose our way when we reject our connection to the natural world. This will offend narrow minds who look upon any challenge to their anthropocentrism as ""anti-human"" or ""tree-hugging sentimentality"".This film argues that evil is not so much the satanic absolute modeled in western tradition as it is an organic malady caused by pain and despair. We do not become evil because we are corrupted by some outside agency; we become evil because we choose hatred over acceptance when confronted by the inevitability of death. How many western cartoons dare to tack into such philosophical winds?Princess Mononoke punctures conventions. The princess of the title is a wolf-child saved from death as an infant by a wolf god and her pack. Now consider: in a western cartoon, the wolf pack would be a misunderstood and persecuted animal family too cute for words and too noble to stomach. In this movie, they are a snarling force of nature who do not hesitate to kill. However, they earn our sympathy because we understand that they are driven to kill both out of necessity and because it is their nature to do so. In a western cartoon, heroic animals would automatically mean casting their human opponents in the role of villains. But in Princess Mononoke, the humans compete for our sympathy because they too are convinced that they must destroy the wolves to ensure their own survival. In a western cartoon, the male hero would rescue the female heroine to live happily ever after. I won't spoil the ending, but consider how much more intelligent, more thoughtful and truer to character is the conclusion in this film.This juxtaposition of conflicting needs and loyalties, all with their own justifications, their own perspectives, and their own claims on our sympathies, combine to produce a richly textured world that is complex in scope and multifaceted in meaning. This film does not capitulate to simplistic solutions. Much of hard work and great beauty is destroyed in the end, but the film still concludes on a note of hope, with the thought that something of wisdom has survived all the death and destruction, and that nature recovers and humans rebuild, perhaps this time, avoiding the mistakes of the past.Like all of Miyazaki's works, he strives for significance over saccharine sentiment. His films are gourmet meals beside the candyfloss of western animation, and I feel a sense of intellectual satiation and fulfilment from Princess Mononoke that western animation rarely invokes. This is intelligent animation for intelligent adults.

521944,A3MQQS40FK2QAQ,B00003CXBK,"Bradford P. Ruhle ""Brad Ruhle""","[1, 1]","I love this movie! I love every single minute of it!! I make this statement because it is the truth. PRINCESS MONONOKE is absolutely the best film of 1999. Technically, it is a 1997 movie, but it was released in the U.S. two years later as part of the contract between Disney and Studio Ghibli. I missed the opportunity to catch it in theaters back in 99, but I got the chance to see it a year later on DVD.All I knew at that time was that it was made by Hayao Miyazaki, who had only two previous films released in the U.S.: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO and KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. I heard stories about how his work is an inspiration to animators at both Disney and Pixar, and that he was a mentor to John Lasseter. I knew nothing about the story or the characters, and that was an advantage in this kind of a film.I'll try not to reveal too much about the story. Set in ancient time when forests were ruled by gods, mankind has been doing terrible damage to the forests and have been angering the gods. When a boar god becomes a murderous demon and attacks a village a young boy named Ashitaka successfully defeats the demon, but at a terrible price. His right arm comes in contact with the demon and he is inflicted with a curse that will eventually kill him. He is the last of his tribe, and is told by the village's wise  woman to go on a journey to find a cure. Cutting his hair, he sets off on his journey, vowing to see the world without hate.Ashitaka saves the life of two men  who live and work in a village known as Iron Town. The town is ruled by a woman named Lady Eboshi. Her people have been cutting down trees in order to manufacture Iron, and have been fighting with the gods with deadly weapons. A human girl named San who was raised by a wolf god has vowed to kill Lady Eboshi and has a deep hatred for all humans, including Ashitaka when he gets in the way of an attack she makes on Eboshi.If this story seems rather oversimplified to you, believe me, it is not. In reality, there isn't really any clear line about who is good and who is evil in this film. Lady Eboshi isn't an evil character. She is a woman with some flawed motivation. She is actually seen as a good person to the people of Iron Town--someone who rescued young prostitutes and given them a much better working and living environment. Another character is Jigon: a man who is simply out to make money.What Miyazaki demonstrates in this movie is that he creates characters that get your attention, and images that are just plain astonishing. He personally draws thousands of frames himself, which is something that most animation directors don't do. With PRINCESS MONONOKE, he does something that very few films, animated or not, are able to accomplish for me. He makes me forget that I'm watching a movie, and makes it feel like I'm actually in this movie. It's like an out of the body experience.I cannot describe these amazing and really beautiful images that PRINCESS MONONOKE gives us. But I can reveal two things.  Many times during the movie there are scenes where you hear absolutely nothing on the soundtrack: no music, no dialogue, no special effects. The image will actually stop for several seconds, without any camera movement. Quiet scenes like this are so rare these days, especially in animated films. Miyazaki understands that not every scene has to have constant movement or quick cutting, like in most Hollywood action movies. PRINCESS MONONOKE does have several action scenes in it, but it is action that you can actually care about.The other thing I can tell you about is the ending. There is a romance in the movie, but this isn't a romance where the hero gets the girl. It is actually one where the hero doesn't get the girl YET! Two of the characters love each other, but they understand that they cannot live together. When this movie ended, I had the sense that a real romance would actually come between them, but it would simply take time. How many movies, animated or not, have the courage to end that way?There is another element in this wonderful movie. The music is by Miyazaki's longtime composer: Joe Hisashi. He has created a beautiful and mesmerizing score for this movie. It adds to the emotional power of the story and images, something so very few movies are able to accomplish.PRINCESS MONONOKE was the film that sparked my interest in Hayao Miyazaki, and I currently own all of his movies on DVD. It also got me interested in other Japanese Anime. What the Japanese understand is that animation does not have to be pigeonholed as entertainment for children. PRINCESS MONONOKE has scenes that are dark and violent. It is rated PG-13, and I consider that rating appropriate. If there are still some children over 13 who still have the childlike wonder in them and haven't lost it due to the cinematic ADD that too many Hollywood movies generate, PRINCESS MONONOKE will be a real treasure.The great filmmaker Howard Hawkes had a formula for defining a great movie: ""Three great scenes, no bad scenes."" Multiply that by three and you get PRINCESS MONONOKE.note: Hayao Miyazaki made the best film for children that I've ever found: MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO. This should be the very first film children see in their lifetimes. If this review has sparked an interest in Miyazaki for you I also recommend a wonderful book about this man: HAYAO MIYAZAKI, MASTER OF JAPANESE ANIMATION by Helen McCarthy, which is available here at

This movie was essentially the &quot;Titanic of Japan.&quot; Makes you wonder what America was thinking then, huh?Certainly not American mainstream (I think its because the story actually needs brain power to comprehend) but amazingly hit a high note for its American DVD release, especially with critics and fans of anime. Its truly a shame that such a high profile release for both America AND Japan would get such a limited theatrical release here in the states. Because it featured such big-name actors, it might've attracted many theatre-goers.Anime has an American misconception that its all Child's Play. On both physical and philosophical levels, this is definately not a kid's movie. It has a little violence, but nothing compared to what most animes bring. The story is also a masterpiece in of itself, which sheds an interesting perspective upon war: neither side is in the right. The main character seems to be the screenwriter himself if he truly believes this perspective. The main character serves as the middle-of-the-road type character for many of the conflicts between the 2 sides.The artwork is astounding. Shadows are cast upon moving characters with a stunning reality, the colors are lush, the picture is clean and crisp, and the characters have a personality all of their own just by their appearance. The lip-synching is wonderfully done, I did not see any &quot;Godzilla&quot; type lip-synching, infamous of Japanese movies.

It is not a lost adventure like Pokemon, neither is it a classic cutesy by Disney or Dreamworks.  This is a film that quickly caught my eyes and ears because of its rare beauty and incredibly poignant feelings(I love anything that is poignant and this film is no exception).  I was quickly captured by the story of a young warrior cursed by a demon god.  The demon itself was cursed by anger and hatred it held towards the destructive humans.  The animal gods and the humans fought many wars against each other, but their hatred only brought destruction to themselves.  There also was the forest spirit who brought both life and death, and could give life to some, but death to others.  The whole story I found to be gripping and thrilling.  The curse, that evil hating curse that could eat people and animals alive.  The conflict between man and beast that did not have to happen.  The wolf girl, San, also known as Princess Mononoke, who was neither wolf or human.  And the mysterious forest god of life and death, pain and relief.  One thing that distinguishes this move from others is that no one is a good guy or a bad guy.  Just about every person has good and evil in them, but hate and anger can infest and destroy anyone.  I have never known of a more captivating movie.  The animation was beautiful and not over done, but very simple and artistic.  The gore and violence is hard to stomache, but it brings more poignant feelings to the viewer.  The music is also very beautiful and ethereal(some might say it sounds very &quot;Enya-like&quot;).

Moon,"[10, 10]","Well, February has seen the first announcements that Princess Mononoke will get a DVD release, and it is apparently more than a rumor, but I'm not holding my breath. As to the movie itself, I must admit I purchased a DVD  player just in anticipation of this film (I figured if Castle of Cagliostro  was getting a DVD release, so would Mononoke).  So as to the movie itself,  no amount of praise would really be adequit.  Somewhere in the back of my  brain is some idea I formed as a child as to exactly what a powerful and  moving film should be--but it is an idea that came to be discarded because  let's face it, Star Wars or Disney after puberty doesn't live up to the  magic it had at 5 years old.  Surprise, surprise, at age 27 I've seen  something that reminded me of what it was like to be 5 years old again.  Miyazaki has been able to do this consistantly not just because he is a  master storyteller (something so many american films could desperately use)  but because his films immerse you in a world that in a very short time you  fail to notice is a cartoon.  As advanced as Disney animation is, all it's  marvels seem bent on impressing, not on immersion, such that while  impressed we cannot help but remember (sometimes painfully) that we are  watching a cartoon.  Mononoke on the other hand will win the audience over  with the still beauty of its settings long before they've even grasped the  fantastic story line. I must also mention that Mononoke has a simply  amazing soundtrack that is free of upbeat musical numbers or pop songs.  With what to my ears sound like a few bows to Rimsky-Korsakov, Hisashi's  score to this film is as delicious as the film itself, standing well on its  own merit, but in conjunction with the film it is utterly unparalleled.  Very rarely does it seem that a film solidly hits on every count, and even  when it does happen, the force of the film in it's totality is often not so  great.  Mononoke however is not just a solid film but a very strong film as  well.  If there is a weak point here it is the english dub, and yet I for  one found the dub very enjoyable and convincing...yet in a film where  everything is perfect, this will no doubt be the point which will earn the  most criticism. Anyway, I've said enough.  If you havn't seen this, you  must.

But it was barely even seen in American theatres, because of a problem we have in accepting anything animated as adult entertainment. But for those of us who have managed to break free of this mental barrier- the reward is great!Set in medieval Japan during the advent of gun warfare, PRINCESS MONONOKE is a tale of intrigue -featuring vivid mythology and timeless themes. Prince Ashitaka finds himself cursed after defending his village from a vicious demon. As a result, he is banished from his village until he can rid himself of the curse and defeat whatever evil has brought the demon upon them. His quest brings him far from home, to a town where the Tatara clan is quickly growing -thanks to new technology and the guidance of Lady Eboshi.

521971,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXBK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","I wouldn't go so far as the New York Post in calling this film ""the 'Star Wars' of animated features,"" but certainly Princess Mononoke is a vibrant, magical movie that resonates with life in all its facets and the spirit that lies beneath this world we too often take for granted.  It's funny how American animated films are always about - well, nothing at all, really, while Japanimation is about basically everything.  To me, dubbing this film into English, no matter how talented and famous the voice actors are, just feels wrong.  Certainly, it helps attract a Western audience that has still only begun to discover the wonders of anime and makes the story much easier for younger viewers to understand, but anime purists will probably want to watch the film as it was originally intended to be shown - and, fortunately, it is possible to change the setup to play the movie in Japanese with English captioning.  Speaking of younger viewers, the film does deserve its PG-13 rating, as more than a few characters lose their heads - literally - and animals are slaughtered in significant numbers during several scenes of fighting and warfare.Princess Mononoke is not so much the story of the princess herself as it is of young Ashitaki, a young warrior who journeys many miles westward in search of a cure for the demon curse transferred unto him by a giant boar demon he managed to kill when it attacked his village.  The odds of him finding and being healed by the Spirit of the Forest are pretty low, making this as much of a spiritual journey as a physical one with a clear purpose.  He and his noble elk steed do find the place, however, after a brief sojourn in Iron Town.  The humans in this fortified village have been clearing away forest so that they can mine the iron ore that exists within the soil in great abundance.  For her part, Lady Eboshi is working to perfect the guns she will use to defend Iron Town from those casting greedy eyes upon it even as she plots with hunters sent by the emperor to slay the Spirit of the Forest himself.  The animal gods of the forest, seeing the human threat now close to destroying their final peaceful retreat, gird up for battle themselves, particularly the boars and the wolves.  Among the wolves is Princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves; she hates all humans for their greedy, destructive ways - a fact which rather complicates the personal bond she eventually comes to share with Ashitaki.It's a rather complicated story, really, but it all culminates with the seemingly unavoidable armed clash of men, gods, and animals - a war that Ashitaki desperately tried to prevent.  Already dying from the demon curse, Ashitaki, a warrior hero with sympathies for both sides of the fight, risks all in an effort to save both the princess and the Spirit of the Forest himself.  You can never take anything for granted in Japanese anime, particularly in terms of who lives and who dies, and this makes the final moments of the film all the more captivating - not to mention poignant.  In a war that can have no true winners, what of the world will be left for those who manage to survive?The animation (which is from 1997) is not all that breath-taking on the face of things; at first, I really couldn't see why it is praised so highly.  As you get into the story, however, and see the absolute importance of nature, as represented in the animation, you quietly become more and more impressed.  The scenes with the little forest sprites are especially magical - they are most unusual creatures, really quite simple in terms of their animated form, but they prove magical indeed as representatives of the forest and the beauty of nature.  The Spirit of the Forest is equally engaging, and much more impressive and majestic in each of his forms.  All of the characters are quite expressive, in fact, revealing as much through the animation as they do with their voices.  That is one reason the movie works so well even with English dubbing.If you've yet to experience anime, I can't think of a better introduction than Princess Mononoke.  With the English dubbing, the viewer is free to take in the whole animated experience (something that would take a second viewing for a movie with subtitles) and see just what makes Japanese animation superior to anything you'll ever see come out of Hollywood.  Hayao Miyazaki didn't make a film, he created a vibrant new universe that will transport viewers back to a medieval age when iron was new and animals still ruled the forests.  Not content to merely entertain, the film addresses a number of questions that get right to the heart of human life itself, touching on themes of love, hate, honesty, community, heroism, selflessness, life, death, stewardship of the Earth, etc.  With only a short featurette and a theatrical trailer, the DVD doesn't have much in the way of special features, but the movie alone more than makes Princess Mononoke worth the price of admission, rental, or purchase.

They think it's too childish or too mature.  This movie is a great place to start, whether you want to see anime or are completely turned off by the genre.  Why?  First, it was produced domestically by Disney, and you know they aren't going to put out something too racey or ridiculous.  Second, the voices are people you know, like Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton (and someone who sounds a lot like James Earl Jones).What else makes this so appealing?  Well, Billy Bob Thornton himself said that watching this, he forgot it was animated early into the movie.  The story is also compelling, with a rather Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy appeal.  The basic plot is that a boy must travel to find the Spirit of the Forest to have a curse removed from him.  On the way, he comes across a mining town, and the story moves into a &quot;harmony with nature&quot; kind of message.  Although it gets much more complicated, I'd prefer not to spoil too much of the movie.Besides the story and familliar voices, the animation in the movie is excellent.

The film contains some of the most impressive and visually stunning images in an animated feature (or even a live action film for that matter) that I have seen in a very long while.

The story and its themes are quite complex and you will have to have an above average attention span to fully appreciate it (a little background in Japanese mythology couldn't hurt either).

Exquisite animation is to be expected in a film by Hayao Miyazaki, and he does not disappoint here.  But this film also delivers his most profound moral statement in a story that does not feature simple heroes and villains.  The human drive to control the environment and improve the quality of life, in the form of Lady Eboshi's ironworks, upsets the balance of nature, but there is more to her than that.  The lepers who make her rifles are grateful for the good treatment they receive from her, and the workers in her factory are prostitutes that she has rescued from the brothels.  Her desire to slay the gods of the forest with her rifles and iron bullets is a potent metaphor for man's drive to conquer nature with technology.  The creatures of the forest are not simplistic good guys, either.  They can be violent and are in danger of being transformed into demons by their rage.

It is by far and away the most beautifully animated FILM (not cartoon) ever made and if this doesn't change your acceptance level of animated films as 'real' movies, nothing will. The story is very mythological in it's aspirations but never loses it's very strong conviction that man and nature MUST co-exist in order for the planet to survive. It's exquisite translation by DC comics scribe Neil Gaiman (of The Sandman fame) helps maintain the deeply emotional and thoughtprovoking nature of the original Japanese script while the voice acting (by the likes of Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thorton, and Gillian Anderson) is perfectly dead-on and expressive. The whole film just shines with high-production values and never - not even for a second - bores the eye.

I would classify this under Classical Anime in a heartbeat but it also finds itself to be the first anime for most people.  Personally... it was my 4th Anime Movie.Genre/Setting: Fantasy, Ancient Times surrounding the initial invention of the Gun and the mining of Iron.Art Style, realistic and very beautiful, a worthy Masterpiece of art.  As you can tell i really enjoyed it.Nudity: NONE... most anime has a little... even if it's a small insignificant scene it at least has something, but this anime... nope, not a thing.  A major reason it can be viewed with the entire family there.Violence is low in comparison to other Anime.  But for the family scene, this Anime contains scenes of cartoon death, dismemberment and animal attacks.It is the story of a young man who becomes cursed while saving his village from a demon.  The demon is actually a large Bore that became possesed by hatred when he was shot by a human.  The curse will spread throughout the young man's body until it kills him.  So, in the meantime he will journey to the heart of the evil behind the bore's hatred to learn for himself the truth ""with eyes unclouded by hate"", so that he may find peace.  From there the plot unfolds.This is not a sword battle movie and though the image on the cover may appear like a lightsaberesque duel is taking place, i assure you it is not based on combat.  In fact the young man in the image rarely takes up his sword in any sort of battle... he's better with his arrows.  And as misleading as the Title may be, it does not have some sort of Helpless princess... Princess Mononoke is just a title given to the daughter of the wolf god.  The movie does have large animals who are like gods and even a forest god who reigns over all of them, but there is no preaching of this religion.On the cast list are names like Claire Daines, Mimi Driver, Billybob Thorton, Gillian Anderson (who plays the role of the Wolf god, whose japanese voice is done by a really deep bass... kinda confusing).  With such names as these taking up the role then it's gotta have something in it right?  And i hear that it almost ran off with #1 movie in Japan, falling to the hyped up Titanic.  It is an anime that the entire family can enjoy and one that will remain classic to all Anime fans, casual and hardcore.

There is certainly a reason why this film is Japan's top grossing film ever, not just animated film, film period.Mononoke has a fabulous story line, set in Fuedal Japan, this movie is primarily about the struggle between nature and man in an industrialising world. It doesn't limit itself to that though, another main theme is dealing with conflicts and hatred. I really respected the way that the characters were represented. Since I consider myself close to nature, I naturally felt more sympathy for San (who is the Princess Mononoke), and the forest gods. However, her enemy, Lady Eboshi, was by no means an evil character, and was very good to people, such as the lepers that she cared for. This emphisised that there is no firm line between good and evil, and theme that I always like to see in movies.The animation of the characters, and especially the sceney was incredible. No animated movie has ever posessed such quality in my opinion, Disney and other american companies pale greatly in comparrison.I have shown this movie to many of my friends, most all of whom are not fans of animated movies, and not one has thought it anythign but spectacular.

521990,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B00003CXBK,elfdart,"[1, 1]","this movie is a classic. the animation is spectacular and the story very well done. I happen to be somewhat into japanese culture as of present, but before i was so into it, and people who i know now who are not into it, sometimes japanese media goes over their heads. the cultures are kind of different and place importance on different things and when a person used to seeing one kind of story or moral repeated over and over in different ways sees something else... well they may not immediately appreciate it (an example of this would be how at the end he doesn't end up with the girl. this happens in almost every western movie because we are very focused on the 'happy ending' fairytale, validating the storyline with the 'kiss at the end', but that doesn't happen in all cultures). however, i found princess mononoke to somewhat transcend this confusion, because the story is so relatable and well told. i found it to be so when i first watched it, which would be late elementary school, and feel this way even more now.the story can be translated in many ways, but the general message i got out of it was the modern attempting to erase tradition. the people of iron town worked hard to destroy the forest because by doing so they could earn a living in the new world making iron. the only way they could do this however was to cut down the forests, which meant that they would have to kill the gods from the old world, who were already dying out. the thing is that the lady osono (or whatever) is painted in something of a bad light as she is cutting down the forest and killing the gods, but she is an amazingly strong humanist and a proactive woman in a time and place where women weren't liable to have that status (the status might help to paint her as a 'bad guy' however, because even though we are making progressions, many people are still very sexist... i would bet you that if not you yourself, someone you know thinks that women are by nature evil or devious... in 2008). So when looking at it in this light osono is opting for humanity. she takes in those lepers, she saves brothel workers from whatever fate they would face in brothels, etc. and yet she's the bad guy. interesting to note at any rate.ashitaka is a great protagonist. a pacifist to the end. he goes on his journey to find something to remove his curse, not for selfish reasons i don't think, but to right the wrong. he's a pretty selfless person. at the beginning of the movie, the reason he got the curse was because his sister was in the way of the boar, so he had to shoot it, but before that he was trying to talk to it. this is basically how he acts throughout the movie. he tries to get things done without violence, but if it comes to it, he will resort to violence to protect himself or those he cares about.didn't really notice the environmental message when i first saw it. i was more focused on cultural loss. but recently, with the environmental bludgeon the media has been playing around with, i noticed just how 'for nature' this movie was. traditionalism would of course take the stance against industry which would be a way to save the forest, so it makes sense, but i guess i just went into it too symbolically. it does have a pleasant environmental message however, better than a lot of other animated environmental movies.so, to sum up, this is a great movie.",5,amazing,1209859200,"05 4, 2008",2008,3365,"['movie', 'classic', 'animation', 'spectacular', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'happen', 'be', 'somewhat', 'japanese', 'culture', 'present', 'i', 'was', 'so', 'people', 'who', 'i', 'know', 'now', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'japanese', 'media', 'heads', 'cultures', 'are', 'kind', 'different', 'place', 'importance', 'different', 'things', 'when', 'person', 'used', 'seeing', 'one', 'kind', 'story', 'moral', 'repeated', 'different', 'ways', 'something', 'else', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'immediately', 'appreciate', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'how', 'end', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'girl', 'almost', 'western', 'movie', 'are', 'very', 'focused', ""'happy"", 'ending', 'fairytale', 'validating', 'storyline', ""'kiss"", 'end', ""n't"", 'happen', 'cultures', 'however', 'i', 'found', 'princess', 'mononoke', 'somewhat', 'transcend', 'confusion', 'story', 'so', 'relatable', 'well', 'told', 'i', 'found', 'be', 'so', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'watched', 'would', 'be', 'late', 'elementary', 'school', 'feel', 'way', 'even', 'more', 'now.the', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'translated', 'many', 'ways', 'general', 'message', 'i', 'got', 'was', 'modern', 'attempting', 'erase', 'tradition', 'people', 'iron', 'town', 'worked', 'hard', 'destroy', 'forest', 'doing', 'so', 'could', 'earn', 'living', 'new', 'world', 'making', 'iron', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'do', 'however', 'was', 'cut', 'down', 'forests', 'meant', 'would', 'have', 'kill', 'gods', 'old', 'world', 'who', 'were', 'already', 'dying', 'out', 'thing', 'lady', 'osono', 'painted', 'something', 'bad', 'light', 'cutting', 'down', 'forest', 'killing', 'gods', 'amazingly', 'strong', 'humanist', 'proactive', 'woman', 'time', 'place', 'where', 'women', 'were', ""n't"", 'liable', 'have', 'status', 'status', 'might', 'help', 'paint', ""'bad"", 'guy', 'however', 'even', 'are', 'making', 'progressions', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'very', 'sexist', 'i', 'would', 'bet', 'not', 'someone', 'know', 'women', 'are', 'nature', 'evil', 'devious', '2008', 'So', 'when', 'looking', 'light', 'osono', 'opting', 'humanity', 'lepers', 'brothel', 'workers', 'fate', 'would', 'face', 'brothels', 'etc', 'yet', 'bad', 'guy', 'interesting', 'note', 'rate.ashitaka', 'great', 'protagonist', 'pacifist', 'end', 'journey', 'find', 'something', 'remove', 'curse', 'not', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'right', 'wrong', 'pretty', 'selfless', 'person', 'beginning', 'movie', 'reason', 'got', 'curse', 'was', 'sister', 'was', 'way', 'boar', 'had', 'shoot', 'was', 'trying', 'talk', 'basically', 'how', 'movie', 'get', 'things', 'done', 'violence', 'will', 'resort', 'violence', 'protect', 'about.did', ""n't"", 'really', 'notice', 'environmental', 'message', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'saw', 'i', 'was', 'more', 'focused', 'cultural', 'loss', 'recently', 'environmental', 'bludgeon', 'media', 'been', 'playing', 'i', 'noticed', 'just', 'how', ""'for"", 'nature', 'movie', 'was', 'traditionalism', 'would', 'course', 'take', 'stance', 'industry', 'would', 'be', 'way', 'save', 'forest', 'sense', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'just', 'went', 'too', 'symbolically', 'have', 'pleasant', 'environmental', 'message', 'however', 'better', 'lot', 'other', 'animated', 'environmental', 'movies.so', 'sum', 'up', 'great', 'movie']",Princess Mononoke

But I love this movie. It's great! And the music is fantastic! You get so caught up in the story that you no longer care wether they mixed computer animation with animation or not. I am glad it was animated because it wouldn't have looked as cool as a live action film. They couldn't have gotten the Spirit of the Forest to look so cool at the end if it wasn't animated! The story is complex and may sound cheesy, but is great when you see it acted out! Ashitaka is a prince of an almost wiped out people in midevil Japan. When he is cursed by a demon, he must leave his people in search of the spirit of the forest. He finds himself in the midst of a war between humans and animals. Because the spirit of the forest lives, all the animals think like humans and some are even considdered gods. The humans are led by Lady Eboshi, ruler of Iron Town where women power over men. The animals are led by the wolf gods, including the wolf Princess Mononoke. Mononoke is a human, but her parents left her with the wolves. Instead of eating her, they raised her. Ashitaka needs the help of the spirit of the forest. Princess Mononoke wishes to save it. Lady Eboshi is determined to kill it.

521998,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00003CXBK,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","First off, I have to say that I am not a big fan of anime, both movies and TV series. Most of them are incredibly over-the-top, some are just plain strange, a lot of them are style-over-substance, and many of them have characters that are WAY too sexual in terms of appearance. The plots themselves are odd to begin with; most of which are as bad as those that we find in more recent cartoons here in the United States. The craze that surrounds these anime films and shows are just wild; it's almost unbelievable. I do respect that other people love these forms of entertainment, but to me, anime is not, and has not been, my thing....Why are you rechecking my last name?...Well anyway, there are some few animes that I really admire, and Princess Mononoke is one of them. This is one of the fewest animated films in which it's targeted at an older audience. It's not a family film: it has blood and no childish humor. It has a strong message: it focuses on humanity and how it's destroying the natural and spiritual side of the world. It is never over-the-top: no quick, colorful shots or strange techno music whatsoever. It's a classic in its genre, and it's Miyazaki's greatest creation, in my opinion. If you're tired of the Akira-like flashy lights, or lack of logic a la Bleach, or maybe even the Pokemon-like cuteness that you find in many children's anime, then Princess Mononoke can be the perfect alternative.Mind you, though, that even though I see this as one of the greatest anime films ever created, it's not one of my top favorites. I did find the film a bit slow in some parts, and there were some moments about environmentalism that felt too preachy. And San was very annoying in some scenes. I just wished she could be quiet when the film goes on. But those are all the flaws that I can find, and they really are few. Princess Mononoke is, without any doubt whatsoever, one of the greatest animated films to ever come from Japan, and is one of the greatest in general.

522000,A1PQLR0EN31PE8,B00003CXBK,E. Smith,"[1, 1]","I am a very harsh critic on Japanese Anime.  Most of the hub bub surrounding Japanese anime is in part because of the violence in the ""cartoon"".  Normally, at least in my case, the stories don't make sense, the characters have extremely exaggerated features such as huge eyes, tiny or no nose and tiny tiny mouths. Plus it's almost like watching cardboard, with the background moves as the characters are ""running"" (basically standing still in a running pose). Sometimes in anime they will only have a body part moving, like an arm or a hand picking up a cup of coffee, as if to signify the every day habits of people. Most of the time there is no depth to the characters, they don't cast shadows, the background is your basic squares and circles.  The buildings are all the same, side characters are extremely poorly drawn and are mostly baboonish, basically lifeless around the main characters.  The stories are illogical and they are missing the connections that get you from one scene to another.  Having said all of that...You get none of that in Princess Mononoke.  It is by a wide majority not only the best Japanese Anime made, but ranks right up there as one of the top animation films of any country.  Not only that it is one of the best films, outside of animation release.  This film doesn't try to dazzle you with CGI (Computer Graphics) and it's not out to try to make the characters look as humanly real as possible.  This film instead embraces animation and makes it an art.  The characters movement are fluent and features are proportional, the background has depth and the story makes sense. Not only that, the filmmaker, knowing that he has a certain freedom with animation, creates these little clicking creatures which acts to the wonderment of this feature.  The films is not only beautifully done visually, but the sounds and the music, which normally gets overlooked, are as good as any live-action feature.  The director paid so much attention to detail that the best way to see this film is widescreen with a DVD.  If you don't see it widescreen, because of the framing, you will be doing yourself a bit of injusted, I think.  I don't want to describe what the story is about because I think this is one of those films that every little bit you find out for yourself makes the film that much more enduring to you.  It's nice to let a picture without preview, fanfare or story description, unfold before your unknowing eyes.  This film is rated PG-13 for images of violence and gore but I think 10 years old and up can handle it. If they can handles films such as Star Wars, Willow or other fantasy movies, they can handle this one.

At first viewing it's hard to tell what the main character is up to. He saves the Princess, then he saves Lady Eboshi. Then he's going to help the ""bad guys""? What?!?! Who is evil and who is good? It's not instantly obvious, which makes Princess Mononoke stand up to repeated viewings - many repeated viewings. The story is complex, but not too complex. It's main themes are humanity versus nature (i.e., itself) and hate. Hate destroys and eats away flesh. The tentacle-like demons fashioned from hate provide some of the most incredible animation, and some of the most poignant scenes. Another theme is the idea that sometimes the best side to be on is neither side.The animation is about as good as it comes. Miyazaki is one of the best, and this is one of his best pictures. If the story happens to bore you (it shouldn't), just look at the incredible animation that never lets up. The animated grass growing towards the end is particularly incredible.Animation does not get much better than this. Visually and thematically, there are not many as good as Princess Mononoke out there. Given its themes, it's somewhat surprising that Disney brought this masterpiece to the States. Sure, some of the English dubbed voices are a little off, but this doesn't detract from the film much. It's interesting to watch the film in its original Japanese with English subtitles. The characters come across a little differently this way, and the translations are different in the subtitles. For instance, the ""Forest Spirit"" becomes the ""Deer God"" in the subtitled version. The voices also are incredibly different, and those who don't appreciate Billy Bob Thorton's drawl will enjoy the Japanese version.There aren't many movies worth owning and watching over and over again, but Princess Mononoke is definitely one of them.",5,Whose side is he on anyway?,1038787200,"12 2, 2002",2002,1945,"['question', 'heart', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'one', 'time', 'think', 'first', 'viewing', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'up', 'Princess', 'then', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'Then', 'going', 'help', 'bad', 'guys', 'What', 'Who', 'evil', 'who', 'good', 'not', 'instantly', 'obvious', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'stand', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'many', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'story', 'complex', 'not', 'too', 'complex', 'main', 'themes', 'are', 'humanity', 'nature', 'i.e.', 'hate', 'Hate', 'destroys', 'eats', 'away', 'flesh', 'tentacle-like', 'demons', 'fashioned', 'hate', 'provide', 'most', 'incredible', 'animation', 'most', 'poignant', 'scenes', 'theme', 'idea', 'best', 'side', 'be', 'side.The', 'animation', 'as', 'good', 'Miyazaki', 'one', 'best', 'one', 'best', 'pictures', 'story', 'bore', 'should', ""n't"", 'just', 'look', 'incredible', 'animation', 'never', 'up', 'animated', 'grass', 'growing', 'end', 'particularly', 'incredible.Animation', 'not', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'Visually', 'thematically', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'as', 'good', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'there', 'Given', 'themes', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'Disney', 'brought', 'masterpiece', 'States', 'Sure', 'English', 'dubbed', 'voices', 'are', 'little', 'off', ""n't"", 'detract', 'film', 'much', 'interesting', 'watch', 'film', 'original', 'Japanese', 'English', 'subtitles', 'characters', 'come', 'little', 'differently', 'way', 'translations', 'are', 'different', 'subtitles', 'instance', 'Forest', 'Spirit', 'Deer', 'God', 'subtitled', 'version', 'voices', 'also', 'are', 'incredibly', 'different', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'drawl', 'will', 'enjoy', 'Japanese', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'movies', 'owning', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'definitely', 'one']",Princess Mononoke

522004,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B00003CXBK,Feelah the tigress,"[1, 1]","This is an interesting film.  It's perhaps the most well known of all of Studio Ghibli's films in the U.S. and also Miyazaki's most mature, violent and serious film.  Thematically, it is most closely similar to his previous film, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which also dealt with heavy environmental themes.  Unlike Nausicaa, which I felt was very one-sided, Princess Mononoke is a much more fair presentation of both the human side and the forest.The story follows Ashitaka, the prince of an obscure tribe of people who is cursed by a boar god-turned-demon.  He leaves the village to find the source of the boar god's curse, even though it's made clear that he doesn't have much hope of lifting his life-threatening curse.  From there, he discovers a war between the old forest gods and a settlement of iron workers...  What I really like about this film is that it presents a realistic portrayal of both sides.  Too often in environmentalist films humans are portrayed as pure evil and nature is always cute cuddly and good.  Princess Mononoke doesn't shy away from showing the vicious dangerous side of the forest and also both the good and bad points of the humans.  Lady Aboshi herself is both an antagonist who wants to destroy the forest to get the iron under it, but also a good person in her compassionate treatment of lepers and former brothel girls.  The film is sensitive enough in it's treatment of the issues that by the end you're not quite sure if either side is fully in the wrong.  That's the mark of a well-done story.As for the visuals, as per Studio Ghibli expectations, they are excellent.  Everything is crisp, bright and beautiful, and all movement feels fluid and natural.  I especially like the depiction of the demon god, as it's quite appropriately icky-looking.  I also love the little forest spirits and their rattling heads - they're quite cute!  Anyway, the music also feels appropriate although I can't say I noticed it much.Princess Mononoke is a film that any Studio Ghibli fan should see at least once.

It was the first Miyazaki film I ever saw and I fell in love with it. Everything about it is wonderful - the animation is absolutely gorgeous, the best I've seen. Disney looks like kiddy doodles in comparison. The story is explained well - the conflict pretty much begins immediately and the rest of the film involves main character Ashitaka trying to resolve the issues he faces. Plenty of action, nice fight scenes, nothing is rushed at all, and there are so many little details that you can easily miss, but that add to the film experience sort of subconsciously. The characters are all very well-developed; I don't quite understand why the antagonist has a British accent, but it manages to work.Possible spoilers here, but I also love that there is no happily ever after ending where Ashitaka and San get married and have a family and all that crap. I don't want to give too much away, but there is no everything turning out perfect. The film ends on a pretty good note, but not how you might expect. Which sometimes happens in real life too - stuff doesn't turn out picture perfect, but things will still work out in spite of some hardships.Even if you're not a huge animation fan, this is still a wonderful film and I'd recommend it for the movie library of pretty much anyone. Even for anime, these characters don't have the huge freaky wading-pool eyes that some anime series have - they look pretty normal.

The reason is the need for each of us to 'wake up' and choose between private greed and the public's good. The two can be made as one with cooperation and insight and knowledge, but that is a rare thing indeed in our world ruled by the greedsters from WallStreet to MainStreet et al.The greed aspect gets its ill gotten reward that destroys it all, but that greed is seen to return in the future and need be fought endlessly as long as such people remain on the scene.

The action is non-stop and full of suprises.  There are many compelling characters, the sound track is excellent and the story is top notch.The film opens when the last young warrior called Ashitaka of a village notices something unusual in the woods approaching his village.  Some sort of mysterious beast makes himself known and begins to attack Ashitaka and begins chasing him.  This is no ordinary beast, it appears to change form and consists of a bunch of worm-like creatures.  Everything in its path is destroyed with ease.  While Ashitaka tries to defend his village, he manages to shoot the beast with two arrows which eventually incapacitate it, but not without a cost.  While Ashitaka was defending his village and attempting to keep the beast away, some of the worm-like creatures grab hold of his arm and cause him great pain leaving an unusual scar.  Later, after consulting with the wise woman of the village, Ashitaka is informed that he has been cursed by an evil spirit and is in grave danger.  There is however one chance of him curing himself.  To cure himself, he must travel to a far away land and find the great benevolent spirit of the forest.  On his journey to finding the great spirit, he faces many trials and tribulations, meets friend and foe but most of the people he meets are consumed with anger and hate which makes it all the more difficult and adds an element of complexity to the story.The film makes two very powerful points about man and his quest to dominate nature and about the consuming and destructive power of hate and anger.

522024,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B00003CXBK,H. Jin,"[2, 2]","To appreciate how exceptional 'Princess Mononoke' is, just try to imagine Disney doing something like this. Imagine how overbearing and preachy its message would be, or how sickly cute and perfect they would make San, or how the owner of the ironworks would be a ruthless, ugly, rich old guy. In contrast, `Mononoke' is a thought-provoking film that refuses to settle for easy answers, and contains very complex and well-drawn characters.One thing to note is that this is quite adult-oriented compared to some Miyazaki films such as `Kiki' or `Totoro'. Although there's nothing gratuitous, there is a surprising amount of violence, and some mature themes. That apart, this film explores typical Miyazaki themes; including environmentalism, alternate history, Japanese mythology, and feminism. And like all Miyazaki films, `Mononoke' is superbly drawn and animated, incorporating some fairly subtle CG effects for the first time. In the original Japanese, the voice acting is universally excellent. (Although people have problems with some performances in the English dub, I can't comment as I always watch anime in its original language).For the characterisation, the movie aggressively turns history on its head by having strong, capable women in powerful positions (even if Ashitaka is cast as the traditional `hero').  Lady Eboshi especially is a fascinating character, as she is a genuine antagonist. Her position puts her in direct conflict with Ashitaka and San not because she is evil, but simply because her needs clash with theirs. San herself is extremely aggressive for a heroine, and the various forest animals are even more ruthless and determined. The film constantly blurs the line between protagonist and antagonist; Eboshi destroys the forest but provides work and shelter for social outcasts, San and Moro defend the forest creatures but resort to violence to do so.  There is no `right' and `wrong' in this movie, just competing agendas. Such depth and thoughtfulness is welcome, and is one reason why I consider Japanese animation to be above its American counterpart.If I had to make one criticism of this film, it's that there might be one too many competing agendas. We have Ashitaka and his quest, San, Eboshi and the ironworks, Moro and the wolves, the boars, the monkeys, the forest gods, Jigo, and the Emperor's mercenaries. There is an awful lot happening in this movie, and the various alliances and battles do require some concentration to follow. This alone means `Mononoke' is more suited to an adolescent/adult audience than for children. The pacing and storytelling is perfect, though, meaning the movie is not really difficult to fully appreciate or understand, provided you put in a little effort.In my opinion, `Princess Mononoke' is Miyazaki's best film, and that's saying something. Outstanding animation, well-drawn characters, intricate plot, and some thought-provoking themes, all presented in a more mature and complex style.

522025,A2CLUVY0XTPRZK,B00003CXBK,H. Thompson,"[3, 3]","INTRO:  4/5 people like this movie usually.  Out of all the people I have ever met that watched this movie, I can count the people who didn't like it on one hand.  Its a great fantasy movie that depicts Japanese culture, great fight scenes, awesome storytelling, and a lot of nature.  I know a lot of people are already thinking that a nature movie can't be that cool...well, this movie definitely proved even me wrong!First of all I would like to mention that even though this movie is rated PG-13 and depicts some scenes of violence, I wouldn't hesitate to show this to a younger kid.  There are like 2 scenes I would question, but they aren't even that bad.  This movie has so much beauty that a lot of people just look at the violence and immediately call it mature, when in reality its far from that. Take a look at a lot of supposed &quot;kid-aimed anime shows&quot; and you'll notice a lot more fan service and violence than this movie.  I shake my head at those sad souls that say this should be an R movie.DVD:  The DVD is average, but great at the same time just because it is Princess Mononoke.  But looking at it unbiased, its just average.  You have the basic Chapter Selection, Language Selection, Subtitles, and Extras as usual.  But its far from complaining.EXTRAS:  Not too much to keep someone going for a long time after the movie is over.  There is a featurette that talks about the dub, and how the actors that dubbed it felt about the movie.  Some other extras not really worth mentioning like trailers.  But its a nice effort.AUDIO:  Japanese and English audio tracks are included, but this is one of the rare cases when I would have to say the English out-does the Japanese by-far.  The English dub was not your typical dub mind you.  They recruited many famous actors like Gillian Anderson (X-Files), and Billy Bob Thorton (Switchblade) that play the characters perfectly.  They really went all-out on it and there is a lot more &quot;feeling&quot; behind the voices.  Watch and compare.VIDEO:  Very crisp and clean.  I could eat off of my screen if it weren't so dusty.  I didn't expect any less.OVERALL:  This is DEFINITELY a must in any movie-lover's collection... be they anime-fan or not.  I hesitated too long to get this movie and was glad when I did.  This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again and get really attached to the characters, its just that good.  I can see them re-doing the DVD though in the near-future with more extras and such since this DVD didn't have a lot in that category.  Look for &quot;Princess Mononoke Special Edition 2-Disc DVD Set&quot; one day, but until then, do yourself a favor and get this version.

522035,A1W16LV46EQQUQ,B00003CXBK,Jean-Francois Virey,"[4, 4]","Hayao Miyazaki is amazing. He can direct offbeat, intimate masterpieces like *My Neighbour Totoro* and masterpieces of epic proportions like *Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind* (one my favorite ten movies of all times). *Princess Mononoke* belongs to the latter category:  it is a mythical allegory of man's relationship with nature, set in a medieval Japan filled with talking beasts, strange fairies with rotating heads, mystical deer and animal corpses animated by energetic, wriggling maggots.I have always found that the better a movie is, the more speechless it will leave me. I once started writing a review for another of Miyazaki's masterpieces, *Kiki's Delivery Service*, but I never posted it because I was so intensely moved by his genius that I was not able to say anything articulate about it.

522036,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,B00003CXBK,Jeffrey Leach,"[3, 3]","I'm glad the first real anime film I ever watched was ""Princess Mononoke."" I never, or almost never, watch anything animated anymore, so stumbling over this brilliant piece of art was fortuitous to say the least. I'm not usually one to buy into hype, but the blazing blurbs on the DVD cover, trumpeting this movie as the most wonderful piece of anime ever made, did convince me to rent it for an evening. So did the gazillions of praiseworthy comments I subsequently found after viewing the film. The fact that several big shot Hollywood actors-including Billy Bob Thornton, Jada Pinkett-Smith, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, and Claire Danes-provided the voices of the characters almost scared me away from this picture. I figured that the only reason these actors signed on to the project revolved around the idea that the central theme of the movie concerned industrialization versus nature. Well, it probably was the driving force for these actors, but you can look beyond all that and just enjoy the film anyway. And trust me, you'll love ""Princess Mononoke."" Set in medieval Japan, the movie is complex, beautiful, and inspiring.Young Prince Ashitaka runs into a big problem when he suffers a serious injury after battling a frighteningly evil creature outside his small village. The wound, a bite mark on his arm, is incurable according to the village doctor. Ashitaka will eventually morph into a demon unless he can somehow find the elusive Princess Mononoke, a human raised in the wild, who may know how to cure this dreaded disease. Leaving the village is difficult for the young prince because local tradition dictates that he may never return. On his trip into the wilds of nature, Ashitaka runs into a mysterious monk named Jigo, stumbles into a war zone, and discovers a fabulous metal works factory run by the beautiful Lady Eboshi. It turns out that this factory, staffed largely by women, produces guns and ammunition for the samurai armies. Eboshi doesn't limit herself to only dealing with one customer, however, as she is a dedicated capitalist willing to sell armaments to anyone with money. When Ashitaka finally meets Mononoke he discovers that the denizens of the forest are attempting to fight back against Eboshi's machinations. Obviously, Ashitaka must decide which side to take in the battle for the earth. He is torn between giving into his love for Mononoke or battling the humans.""Princess Mononoke"" is much more than a simple action tale, although there are plenty of intense combat sequences. Love plays a big part in the story, between Ashitaka and Mononoke as well as a love for the purity of nature. Malice rears its ugly head, too. Not only is Eboshi filled with odium, but so is Mononoke as she battles the humans destroying the wilderness. It's to the film's credit that it never takes a black or white view of either humans or animals. Each side has an ugly aspect that often emerges in startling ways. The movie eventually seems to say that humans need to forget about dominating nature and instead find their own niche within it. Still, there can be little doubt about where the filmmakers' sympathies lie. All of the greatest scenes in the movie involve Ashitaka's interactions with nature and the animals. The animators pulled out all the stops in presenting a truly magical world. Pay special attention to the wondrous nature god's awe-inspiring transformations and the little forest apparitions that appear to guide Ashitaka through the forest. These scenes constitute the finest animation I have ever seen, animation that should rightfully carry the tag ""art"" more often than not.The only problem I had with the film concerned some of the voiceovers. I thought Billy Crudup did a fine job as the heroic Ashitaka. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Claire Danes's work as Mononoke. I continually felt this actress had no conception of her character or how to convincingly vocalize her attributes. I began to develop a distinct sense of dread every time Mononoke opened her mouth. As for the other American actors, they did an acceptable job. Thornton did better than I thought he would as the voice of the wily Jigo, considering this actor's southern accent, but then again the monk doesn't appear too often in the movie. Only after I watched the movie and returned it did I think about viewing it in Japanese with subtitles. I suspect that would have been a better way to see this film. These criticisms in no way require me to give ""Princess Mononoke"" less than five stars.The DVD edition of the film does contain a few extras, including some interviews with the American actors voicing some of the characters, a trailer, and a widescreen presentation. I didn't think animation would use widescreen, but what do I know? ""Princess Mononoke"" doubtless appeals to fans of the anime genre, but it should have an equal effect on non-fans. I know I couldn't believe some of the stuff I was seeing in this movie-yes, it's that powerfully beautiful. I wouldn't just watch this one again; I'm thinking about buying myself a copy. That's how much I liked the darn thing. Maybe I ought to start watching more anime in the near future.",5,Magical,1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,5182,"[""'m"", 'glad', 'first', 'real', 'anime', 'film', 'ever', 'watched', 'was', 'Princess',

522037,A1RSXP7MB772E3,B00003CXBK,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[2, 2]","Princess Mononoke is directed by the famous Hayao Miyazaki, who is best known for his unworldly imagination. There is perhaps no other medium of film that can hope to express what things come from his dreams. Anime has been around since I was a little kid, and yet this modern classic has eluded me until just now. It reminds me of how direct and simple a story can appear to be at first, and yet that simplistic story altogether manages to open your minds box, and expose you to breath-taking beauty. Princess Mononoke is a fantastic world that is in the last days of its purity. Gods still roam the magical forests, and people are still afraid to wander too deep into them. These are perhaps ancient fears that we are born with that are now archaic, but nontheless still thicken our blood and are instantly respected.Ashitaka is one of the hero's in Princess Mononoke, in a story that really does not have a story book bad guy. The closest thing to it is the ambitious, yet humane Lady Eboshi. But she is much too tempered by faith, and noble responsiblity for her people. She does not seek to harm and abide in the death of mother nature, but is rather a dedicated leader that believes she is making the best choices for her people considering the alternatives. In this world, there are choices and there are consequences, and those balances make the climatic ending even more unforgetable.San has been raised by wolf's but one day her simple tale of revenge is blown of its track when she is saved by a human boy, whose last words before certain death is to describe succinctly that she is beautiful. Not the typical last words of a race she sees with only eyes of bitter hate. And she is uprooted with new feelings that perhaps she has never felt before. The cold blade that delivers death cannot slit Ashitaka's throat. It lies at his throat, just a pulse away from releasing his pain and leaving the world without one more evil human. It is the wolf way, and their forest is under attack by the unnumberable humans anyways. She has had a violent life, in some scenes here face is bloodied, and it seems to suit her primal characteristic. But compassion and something else transforms the entire movie on its face.Princess Mononoke is lacking in nothing, and is an epic anime movie that has rocked my world. I think that you find a new perception about peace and the qualities of the world after watching Princess Mononoke. It portrays a new world, even for old dogs to the cinema world. Watch it with dub or with direct translation subtitles and its original Japanese, I really do not prefer one over the other. I appreciated some of the voice-over work done by english speaking actors here. The wolf god is spoken by a male in the original Japanese, and I really thought that mother was better spoken by the english woman chosen for the role instead, because she added another layer of cruelty, mien, and on the other hand the capability to be kind, as she is wise to the world. All of this just by her voice.Princess Mononoke is a legendary picture, and is officially the longest running anime of all time. It has been heralded by critics around the world and is of national pride in Japan. If you haven't seen this stunning movie then I highly recommend you see this fantastic movie. It was painted with hundreds of additional colors and many scenes were hand drawn by Mr. Hayao Miyazaki himself. I think of this movie more as a piece of beautiful art.",5,"A story about the almost undeniable effects of hate, and a legedary quest of peace in a world of war",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",2010,3461,"['Princess', 'Mononoke', 'directed', 'famous', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'who', 'best', 'known', 'unworldly', 'imagination', 'perhaps', 'other', 'medium', 'film', 'can', 'hope', 'express', 'what', 'things', 'come', 'dreams', 'Anime', 'been', 'was', 'little', 'kid', 'yet', 'modern', 'classic', 'eluded', 'just', 'now', 'how', 'direct', 'simple', 'story', 'can', 'appear', 'be', 'first', 'yet', 'simplistic', 'story', 'altogether', 'open', 'minds', 'box', 'expose', 'breath-taking', 'beauty', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'fantastic', 'world', 'last', 'days', 'purity', 'Gods', 'still', 'roam', 'magical', 'forests', 'people', 'are', 'still', 'afraid', 'wander', 'too', 'deep', 'are', 'perhaps', 'ancient', 'fears', 'are', 'born', 'are', 'now', 'archaic', 'nontheless', 'still', 'thicken', 'blood', 'are', 'instantly', 'respected.Ashitaka', 'one', 'hero', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'story', 'really', 'not', 'have', 'story', 'book', 'bad', 'guy', 'closest', 'thing', 'ambitious', 'yet', 'humane', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'much', 'too', 'tempered', 'faith', 'noble', 'responsiblity', 'people', 'not', 'seek', 'harm', 'abide', 'death', 'mother', 'nature', 'rather', 'dedicated', 'leader', 'making', 'best', 'choices', 'people', 'considering', 'alternatives', 'world', 'are', 'choices', 'are', 'consequences', 'balances', 'make', 'climatic', 'ending', 'even', 'more', 'unforgetable.San', 'been', 'raised', 'wolf', 'one', 'day', 'simple', 'tale', 'revenge', 'blown', 'track', 'when', 'saved', 'human', 'boy', 'last', 'words', 'certain', 'death', 'describe', 'succinctly', 'beautiful', 'Not', 'typical', 'last', 'words', 'race', 'only', 'eyes', 'bitter', 'hate', 'uprooted', 'new', 'feelings', 'perhaps', 'never', 'felt', 'cold', 'blade', 'delivers', 'death', 'can', 'not', 'slit', 'Ashitaka', 'throat', 'throat', 'just', 'pulse', 'away', 'releasing', 'pain', 'leaving', 'world', 'one', 'more', 'evil', 'human', 'wolf', 'way', 'forest', 'attack', 'unnumberable', 'humans', 'anyways', 'had', 'violent', 'life', 'scenes', 'here', 'face', 'bloodied', 'suit', 'primal', 'characteristic', 'compassion', 'something', 'else', 'entire', 'movie', 'face.Princess', 'Mononoke', 'lacking', 'nothing', 'epic', 'anime', 'movie', 'rocked', 'world', 'think', 'find', 'new', 'perception', 'peace', 'qualities', 'world', 'watching', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'new', 'world', 'even', 'old', 'dogs', 'cinema', 'world', 'Watch', 'dub', 'direct', 'translation', 'subtitles', 'original', 'Japanese', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'prefer', 'one', 'other', 'appreciated', 'voice-over', 'work', 'done', 'english', 'speaking', 'actors', 'here', 'wolf', 'god', 'spoken', 'male', 'original', 'Japanese', 'really', 'thought', 'mother', 'was', 'better', 'spoken', 'english', 'woman', 'chosen', 'role', 'instead', 'added', 'layer', 'cruelty', 'mien', 'other', 'hand', 'capability', 'be', 'kind', 'wise', 'world', 'just', 'voice.Princess', 'Mononoke', 'legendary', 'picture', 'officially', 'longest', 'running', 'anime', 'time', 'been', 'heralded', 'critics', 'world', 'national', 'pride', 'Japan', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'stunning', 'movie', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'see', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'was', 'painted', 'hundreds', 'additional', 'colors', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', 'hand', 'drawn', 'Mr.', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'piece', 'beautiful', 'art']",Princess Mononoke

That's because even though those films appear ""less ambitious"" than Mononoke Hime they moved you emotionally, spiritually.  Unfortunately that's missing from Mononoke.  I can't buy into the argument that since there is no side you cheer for that this is more realistic=great.  That doesn't make it great.  And it's certainly not what made Miyazaki's previous works so enjoyable.  Maybe I expected too much but even that put aside I didn't experience the same emotional charge and sense of wonder as I did when watching Laputa or Nausicaa.Even the ending was disappointing.  There was no real resolution to the conflict.  We didn't really learn much about anybody except how much Rage can cloud their judgements.  The story line wasn't very memorable.  I can't even remember the soundtrack.  (astonishing considering Jo's past accomplishments in previous works).It's unfortunate since this was Miyazaki's first real big exposure to the US audience.

522041,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00003CXBK,Joe Sherry,"[0, 0]","A film by Hayao MiyazakiThis is probably the best Miyazaki film that I have seen.  It rivals Kiki's Delivery Service for having a story that I could get involved in and truly enjoy, but it also surpasses Spirited Away in terms of quality and storytelling craft (in my view).  Kiki's Delivery Service used to be my favorite Miyazaki film, but I believe that has now changed.  Princess Mononoke is a superior film.This is a fairly complex story about technology vs nature.  Near the beginning there is a boar which appears to be covered in some kind of grub worms.  Wherever the boar steps, the grass and trees die.  The boar is on a rampage and when it appear that the boar is headed for his village, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) is forced to attack and kill the boar.  Only then does Ashitaka learn that the boar was really a forest god turned demon.  Ashitaka was infected and the iron ball that was the poison inside the boar is also going to poison and kill Ashitaka.  Ashitaka heads to the west to find out how to seek out the Great Forest Spirit and find a way to cure this poison.Ashitaka finds his way to Iron Town and meets the leader, Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver).  Eboshi initially seems to be the villain, but as we get to learn more about her we see that she is not a villain, but rather simply human.  She is destroying the environment to create iron weapons and materials, but she has also rescued prostitutes from brothels and takes care of them.  She is both sympathetic as well as a harbinger of destruction.  Eboshi has a nemesis in a young girl living with the wolves named San (Claire Danes).  San has been raised by the wolf gods and is fighting to preserve the forest and the gods.  Ashitaka sees the good in both, even if neither San nor Eboshi can see the positives in the other.I have only touched on the surface of the depth of this movie.  It is a story so big that it could only be told in animation (I just don't think that live action could have succeeded with this story).  The animation is beautiful, if a little graphic at times with the violence. This is definitely not children's animation.  Besides being one of the best films of Miyazaki's career, I would rate this as a great movie.  Period.  Forget about it being a great animated movie, this is a great movie.  Princess Mononoke also features the voice talent of Gillian Anderson, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Billy Bob Thornton (who does a fantastic job).

522046,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B00003CXBK,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[0, 0]","It is difficult for me to select a favorite Miyazaki movie because I happen to be fond of all of them, but if I were to choose, PRINCESS MONONOKE would definitely be one lucky candidate. This aesthetically breathtaking, multi-layered epic about the legendary clash between man and beast set in a forest-covered world became Japan's hugest box office grossing movie ever upon its 1997 release. Taking the whole movie into account, it's really not hard to understand why. Not just a depiction of what happens when hatred gets out of hand and/or when nature is threatened, this is a lavishly animated spectacle as well as a compelling exercise of portraying its characters neither as perfect heroes or deplorable villains, but flawed, believable people displaying tangible emotions.The film's action begins when a courageous and compassionate Emishi prince, Ashi-taka, becomes infected with a deadly curse after killing a demon attacking his village. In the hopes of finding a cure, Ashi-taka sets off toward the West astride his faithful elk, Yakul, and finds himself caught in the midst of a war. On one side is a proud clan of human commanded by the ruthless Lady Eboshi, who is clearing the forest mainly for the sake of her own people (a group of outcasts which consist of lepers and brothel girls). On the other side are the Animal Gods of the forest who want to destroy the humans and protect their natural environment, led by the intimidating wolf matriarch Moro. Her human cub, Princess Mononoke herself, aka San, harbors a grudge against all humans and desires to kill them all (namely Eboshi)... or die trying. When Ashi-taka rescues her, however, she finds herself developing feelings for him that she's never felt before--are *all* humans truly evil, or is there at least one who can be trusted?Families who have been spoiled by Disney movies may probably have a hard time determining who is ""good"" or who is ""evil"", but as mentioned, this is not Miyazaki's intention. His movie is meant to display the flaws of human beings and their inability to understand how their own inner demons and/or consummation of another world can bring about deadly consequences. The only character in the movie that comes close to being a villain is a squat monk known as Jigo, who wants the head of the mystical Forest Spirit in exchange for riches. But even then, Jigo has his own motives; he is not so much evil as much as he is just ""trying to get by"".It is probably a little daring to say that out of Miyazaki's films, this is probably his most ""adult"" film to date, for it contains more violence than most of his other work. For example, in one scene, Ashi-taka, possessed by the curse on his arm, tries to stop samurai from attacking innocent people, and in doing so slashes off one man's arms, and later, another's head with two arrows. Horrifying and disturbing as the sight is (as well as some occasional blood spurts), such moments are included only to show its devastating effects. Some Japanese animated features tend to go overboard in depicting such gory sequences; in the case of PRINCESS MONONOKE, however, the violence never overpowers the meaning of the story, and is actually done in a way that is neither gratuitous nor squeamish. Even so, this is a movie that is arguably best appreciated by older viewers rather than youngsters.For those who love to watch Studio Ghibli productions for their state-of-the-art production values, PRINCESS MONONOKE will do little to disappoint you in this area. Every frame is painted with imaginative visuals and exquisite detail that I have rarely seen matched in other animated films. Not only are the forests lush and magical but the creatures who inhabit it are difficult to forget, especially the cute little Tree Spirits who appear and disappear at will as well as the Great Forest Spirit himself--a tall, human-faced deer whose every steps make plants grow. At night he becomes the Nightwalker, a ghostly specter that towers over the trees. This is one of the many spectacular moments of wonder that, if anything, warrant the purchase of this movie--in addition, of course, to the compelling, multi-faceted characters and equally sweeping storyline.PRINCESS MONONOKE was picked up for distribution by Miramax several years ago, and while everyone loves to fault them for the many mistakes they made in handling this movie (such as giving it only a non-existent marketing campaign), I'm sure there are those who will argue that Disney's English tracks for Miyazaki's movies are some of the best around, and this is no exception. Acclaimed writer Neil Gaiman's adaptation is not only faithful to Miyazaki's original screenplay (changing around only a few things here and there for comprehension purposes for audiences unfamiliar with its Japanese customs), but also just about every word of dialogue seems to avoid the somewhat clunky, odd-sounding lines that some dubs can sometimes suffer from. The English voice cast chosen to speak his script consists of various famous stars; these include Billy Crudup, Minnie Driver, Gillian Anderson, and Jada Pinkett-Smith. All provide solid vocal performances; some folks have issues with Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo and Claire Danes as San, but IMO both are every bit as good as the aforementioned actors.The DVD presentation of this movie is phenomenal; the visual clarity is spectacular, and the English, Japanese, and French audio tracks are all reference-quality.  On the other hand, the minimal extras are a bit of a sour note. All that's included are a theatrical trailer (where Miyazaki and MONONOKE are both mispronounced) and a skimpy featurette featuring comments from the principal members of the voice cast as well as ADR director, Jack Fletcher (Gaiman appears briefly). Hopefully Disney will one day revisit this masterpiece and give it the luscious two-disc treatment it deserves.",5,"Breathtaking Miyazaki masterpiece--watch it with ""eyes unclouded"".",1047168000,"03

But I loved ""Grave of the Fireflies"" from the same studio, and ""Whiper of the Heart,"" which I think Miyazaki had a hand in.Miyazaki takes the complexities of a simple problem (must the need for mechanization and what we make of natual resourses ruin nature?) and weaves a story of the most glorious creatures one has ever seen, imagined or not had the imagination to imagine. And although there is a hero and a heroine, nobody else is all good or all bad. I loved all the characetrs, from the girls rescued from a brothel to the (GULP!) Night Walker. Move over, Lawrence Olivier in Henry V (sorry; I was just thinking of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen).There is a problem wih my DVD player, and I couldn't get the original soundtrack.

The Japanese language is spoken rather quickly, and while the English-speaking actors could keep up, the subtitle-writers could not (besides, they have to take the reading speed of the audience into consideration as well).. (There have been movies where I have learned things from the subtitles that I hadn't even known were in the movies---this is NOT one of them!)You will learn a lot more of what's going on in the speech and thought of the characters--unless you know Japanese--if you watch the English language version.",5,Sound?

The visuals are absolutely stunning at times and the characters expressively drawn. Not only that, but it has a well-crafted story which bravely avoids the trap of a cliched 'Hollywood' ending where the 'bad guys' get beaten and the 'good guys' kiss and live happily ever after. The characters and factions in the story are much less black and white than pretty much all animation (and live action for that matter) that I've seen. All 'sides' in the central conflict of nature versus technology have legitimate motivations, and all of them also have something to learn. The ending is quite ambiguous (perhaps leaving room for a sequel?), leaving behind the moral that conflicting points of view can exist together without one having to destroy the other.I only had a couple of gripes. Firstly, I thought the two central characters could have done with a bit more meaningful dialogue to develop them and their relationship. This may be a symptom of the second problem, which was that the English adaptation of the script was a little disappointing. I've only seen the film in English (I'd like to see it in the original Japanese with subtitles, which is possible with the DVD), and I thought the 90s American voices jarred somewhat with the mythic Japanese setting. Some of the voices fitted the characters quite well (Gillian Anderson's character, for example) but others just seemed out of place, like the warrior monk who sounded like Hank off King of the Hill!However, overall I enjoyed the film very much and appreciated its lessons.

However, if you're new to Miyazaki and anime in general I would recommend caution and an open mind as well.

It is very violent (pushing an R rating, in my opinion) with a complex plotline, mythical references, and much that the kids just won't understand. There isn't the nudity often found in other anime - the absence of which seems to be a Miyazaki trademark - so that's a plus, but if you're looking for something suitable for children I would recommend some other Miyazaki films instead. For the youngest, the English language versions of &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; and &quot;Kiki's Delivery Service&quot; are adorable.

And the easy answers of the prince hero are shown to be shallow to a certain extent.  However, although the viewer is left to make his or her own evaluations, there are clear messages: the forest and the forest spirit are sacred, and in the end not understandable by humans.

Sometimes it seemed that conjuring up weird wonders was more important than telling the story.Were all those weird wonders really necessary?  Origins successfully tells the same type of eco story without the menagerie.  Princess Mononoke was quite capable of defending her forest without their help.  In fact, she would have come across as an even more heroic lass if she had been a solitary warrior.I don't expect a story to be exactly the way I want it to be.

There is not a single of his movies that I've seen so far, much less a moment through any of them, that you could do away with and criticize for being unnecessary.The story of ""Princess Mononoke"" gets you hooked within minutes, with animation and music that make you forget that you are not watching a live feature. The result of some of the landscape shots to the score by Joe Hisaishi result breathtaking and the voiceover of some extraordinary North American talent (Billy Bob Thornton, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, etc.) makes the movie stand out even more, further helping bridge a cultural gap that was unthinkable to overcome years ago.In a nutshell, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a movie both you and your children will enjoy. It leaves you with a very powerful message about the struggle between the human race and nature, and how our ""progress"" has gradually done away with entire forests, resulting in animals loosing their homes and us loosing the benefits trees bring about. It is more than just an environmental message. It questions our motivations and puts things in perspective, showing how even those with the best intentions can eventually do wrong, causing harm to others. In short, check it out.

522089,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00003CXBK,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[9, 9]","Japanese anime has a never-ending ability to surprise and refresh my concepts of that is possible in an 'artificial' format.  Perhaps this is merely due to my status as a rank amateur, but I seem to get more excited by this format than I have by any other in some time.  There is something in anime that reaches past the traditional limits of modern illustrative animationFor example, take 'Princess Mononoke.'  On the surface, this is not a complicated film.  Prince Ashitaka receives an evil wound while defending his village from a forest wild boar god that has been driven insane by poisoned bullet.  The village wise woman tells Ashitaka that he is doomed to death, and sends him on a quest to the home of the ruined deity, where his task is to 'see with eyes unclouded by hatred.'  And so, Ashitaka comes to Irontown where the need for resources has put the town in conflict with the natural world about them.The beautiful Lady Eboshi leads the town on a perpetual assault against the forest.  There, with the aid of Jigo, the Emperor's representative, she plans to kill the forest spirit and give its head to the Emperor.  Opposing her is the wolf girl San, Princess Mononoke.  San and her wolves are fighting a losing battle to stop Eboshi and her villagers.  She has renounced her fellow humans and seeks to kill all who endanger the forest.  Into the middle of this steps Ashitaka, who tries to help both sides to survive, and receives few thanks for his concern.Too often, this type of plot would invite a great deal of overacting and bombastic dialogue.  Yet that is exactly what does not happen in Hiyao Miyuzaki's delivery of this tale.  The viewer will come to love the villagers and can at least admire Lady Eboshi for her fierce determination and care for her own.  Jigo is driven by greed, but he is hardly unwise, and knows how to bend with circumstances.  Mononoke is angry, fiercely bloodthirsty as well as beautifully and tragically heroic.  Only Ashitaka is all of one color, despite a wound that threatens to turn him into a demon.Instead of being a pretty film with a message, Miyazaki has created a film with many levels.  He turns his eye to many conflicts that have no clear resolution and allows them to retain the dignity of their context.  Thus, an animated film becomes more real than reality, where even the tragedy of change can become life affirming.  The naturalness of the translation and dubbing (carried out under the watchful eye of Neil Gaiman) will also surprise those of us who are used to having to watch the sub-titles to get a true sense of what is being said.This film is extremely worthwhile, and watchable by any audience that can manage the unavoidable violence.  One that will stay in mind for some time to come, and that I will mention when someone asks me what I would recommend as an introduction to the complex world of anime.",5,See With Eyes Uncouded,1039046400,"12 5, 2002",2002,2881,"['Japanese', 'anime', 'never-ending', 'ability', 'surprise', 'refresh', 'concepts', 'possible', ""'artificial"", 'format', 'Perhaps', 'merely', 'due', 'status', 'rank', 'amateur', 'seem', 'get', 'more', 'excited', 'format', 'have', 'other', 'time', 'something', 'anime', 'traditional', 'limits', 'modern', 'illustrative', 'animationFor', 'example', 'take', ""'Princess"", 'Mononoke', 'surface', 'not', 'complicated', 'film', 'Prince', 'Ashitaka', 'evil', 'wound', 'defending', 'village', 'forest', 'wild', 'boar', 'god', 'been', 'driven', 'insane', 'poisoned', 'bullet', 'village', 'wise', 'woman', 'Ashitaka', 'doomed', 'death', 'quest', 'home', 'ruined', 'deity', 'where', 'task', ""'see"", 'eyes', 'unclouded', 'hatred', 'so', 'Ashitaka', 'Irontown', 'where', 'need', 'resources', 'put', 'town', 'conflict', 'natural', 'world', 'them.The', 'beautiful', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'town', 'perpetual', 'assault', 'forest', 'aid', 'Jigo', 'Emperor', 'representative', 'kill', 'forest', 'spirit', 'give', 'head', 'Emperor', 'Opposing', 'wolf', 'girl', 'San', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'San', 'wolves', 'are', 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'stop', 'Eboshi', 'villagers', 'renounced', 'fellow', 'humans', 'kill', 'who', 'endanger', 'forest', 'middle', 'steps', 'Ashitaka', 'who', 'help', 'sides', 'survive', 'few', 'thanks', 'concern.Too', 'often', 'type', 'plot', 'would', 'invite', 'great', 'deal', 'overacting', 'bombastic', 'dialogue', 'exactly', 'what', 'not', 'happen', 'Hiyao', 'Miyuzaki', 'delivery', 'tale', 'viewer', 'will', 'come', 'love', 'villagers', 'can', 'least', 'admire', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'fierce', 'determination', 'care', 'own', 'Jigo', 'driven', 'greed', 'hardly', 'unwise', 'how', 'bend', 'circumstances', 'Mononoke', 'angry', 'fiercely', 'bloodthirsty', 'as', 'well', 'beautifully', 'tragically', 'heroic', 'Only', 'Ashitaka', 'one', 'color', 'wound', 'turn', 'demon.Instead', 'being', 'pretty', 'film', 'message', 'Miyazaki', 'created', 'film', 'many', 'levels', 'eye', 'many', 'conflicts', 'have', 'clear', 'resolution', 'retain', 'dignity', 'context', 'Thus', 'animated', 'film', 'more', 'real', 'reality', 'where', 'even', 'tragedy', 'change', 'can', 'become', 'life', 'affirming', 'naturalness', 'translation', 'dubbing', 'carried', 'out', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Neil', 'Gaiman', 'will', 'also', 'surprise', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'having', 'watch', 'sub-titles', 'get', 'true', 'sense', 'what', 'being', 'said.This', 'film', 'extremely', 'worthwhile', 'watchable', 'audience', 'can', 'manage', 'unavoidable', 'violence', 'One', 'will', 'stay', 'mind', 'time', 'come', 'will', 'mention', 'when', 'someone', 'what', 'would', 'recommend', 'introduction', 'complex', 'world', 'anime']",Princess Mononoke

522093,ASU3THM5ZUTUI,B00003CXBK,"Mark Lee ""Peacemaker""","[0, 0]","I have already written a review on this incredible movie, but I accidentally made it a private review.  Over time, however, it made me furious to find 1-star reviews here, and so I decided I should write another review.The theme of this review is that &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is NOT an average Disney cartoon by any means.  It's very different for a variety of reasons.1) The storyline.  No 5-year-old kid could ever understand the storyline to this film.  It's about a young prince who was cursed by a demon that attacked his village.  After he killed the demon, the prince discovered that the curse is a curse of hatred that comes from the west.  He must go and stop the evil that is going on in the west, to &quot;see with eyes unclouded by hate.&quot;  Otherwise, the curse will kill him.  The rest I leave to you, but the basic point is that the flim is about love and hate, joy and sorrow, and human life and death.2) The dialogue.  The script in this film is truly unforgettable, with quotes like: &quot;You cannot alter your fate my prince, however you can rise to meet it if you choose&quot;, and &quot;Now watch closely everyone, I'm going to show you how to kill a god.  A god of life and death.  The trick is not to fear him.&quot;3) The violence.  Yes, there is enough violence in this film to merit a PG-13 rating, and although an arrow doesn't NORMALLY chop arms off, it just goes to show that when hatred takes over someone, it can really make them crazy.4) There's no real &quot;good guy&quot; or &quot;bad guy&quot;.  Although San wanted to protect her forest, she and her wolves also killed the husbands of many of the women in Irontown.  And although Lady Eboshi wanted to destroy the forest for iron, she also cared for the lepers of Irontown and was very loving to her people.  And the prince doesn't side with either one of them, he just wants to make peace so his curse will be removed.5) The length of the film.  It is 134 minutes long.6) The animation.  It is absolutely incredible.  It took three years to create this film, and they were not wasted.  The Nightwalker is absolutely an amazing sight to behold!  And when the prince entered the magical forest, he said, &quot;This place is magical.&quot;  I said the exact same thing.  I forgot I was watching a cartoon.  I forgot I was watching a movie.  I even forgot my own name.  It was that breathtaking!  (Oh, and by the way, the dubbing was done along with RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match the English language!)Bottom Line: If this STAGGERINGLY good movie ISN'T so good that it makes you forget everything as you watch it, then my name isn't....uh....uh....uh....",5,I'd give this more stars than there are in the universe!,1000684800,"09 17, 2001",2001,2660,"['have', 'already', 'written', 'review', 'incredible', 'movie', 'accidentally', 'made', 'private', 'review', 'time', 'however', 'made', 'furious', 'find', '1-star', 'reviews', 'here', 'so', 'decided', 'should', 'write', 'review.The', 'theme', 'review', 'quot', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'quot', 'NOT', 'average', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'means', 'very', 'different', 'variety', 'reasons.1', 'storyline', '5-year-old', 'kid', 'could', 'ever', 'understand', 'storyline', 'film', 'young', 'prince', 'who', 'was', 'cursed', 'demon', 'attacked', 'village', 'killed', 'demon', 'prince', 'discovered', 'curse', 'curse', 'hatred', 'west', 'must', 'go', 'stop', 'evil', 'going', 'west', 'quot', 'see', 'eyes', 'unclouded', 'hate.', 'quot', 'Otherwise', 'curse', 'will', 'kill', 'rest', 'leave', 'basic', 'point', 'flim', 'love', 'hate', 'joy', 'sorrow', 'human', 'life', 'death.2', 'dialogue', 'script', 'film', 'truly', 'unforgettable', 'quotes', 'quot', 'can', 'not', 'alter', 'fate', 'prince', 'however', 'can', 'rise', 'meet', 'choose', 'quot', 'quot', 'Now', 'watch', 'closely', 'everyone', ""'m"", 'going', 'show', 'how', 'kill', 'god', 'god', 'life', 'death', 'trick', 'not', 'fear', 'him.', 'quot', '3', 'violence', 'Yes', 'enough', 'violence', 'film', 'merit', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'arrow', ""n't"", 'NORMALLY', 'chop', 'arms', 'just', 'show', 'when', 'hatred', 'someone', 'can', 'really', 'make', 'crazy.4', 'real', 'quot', 'good', 'guy', 'quot', 'quot', 'bad', 'guy', 'quot', 'San', 'wanted', 'protect', 'forest', 'wolves', 'also', 'killed', 'husbands', 'many', 'women', 'Irontown', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'wanted', 'destroy', 'forest', 'iron', 'also', 'cared', 'lepers', 'Irontown', 'was', 'very', 'loving', 'people', 'prince', ""n't"", 'side', 'one', 'just', 'make', 'peace', 'curse', 'will', 'be', 'removed.5', 'length', 'film', '134', 'minutes', 'long.6', 'animation', 'absolutely', 'incredible', 'took', 'three', 'years', 'create', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'wasted', 'Nightwalker', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'sight', 'behold', 'when', 'prince', 'entered', 'magical', 'forest', 'said', 'quot', 'place', 'magical.', 'quot', 'said', 'exact', 'same', 'thing', 'forgot', 'was', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'forgot', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'even', 'forgot', 'own', 'name', 'was', 'breathtaking', 'Oh', 'way', 'dubbing', 'was', 'done', 'RE-ANIMATING', 'mouth', 'movements', 'match', 'English', 'language', 'Bottom', 'Line', 'STAGGERINGLY', 'good', 'movie', ""N'T"", 'so', 'good', 'forget', 'everything', 'watch', 'then', 'name', ""n't"", '.uh', '.uh', '.uh']",Princess Mononoke

My Japanese daughter-in-law turned me on to this type of entertainment. I am 60 years old and love this movie. The artwork is amazing. I have never seen anything like it. Shadows, breaking of branches, leaves blowing. It is amazing. The people look like cartoons, albeit well-illustrated, but meld easily into the extremely realistic scenery. The story is great. Kept my interest for the whole time. It starts off a little ""fake"" with a giant boar but give it time. It really develops into an amazing story the whole family will enjoy. I have been watching many of Miyazaki's movies now. They are all good and different. You won't be disappointed.Update: I just got a gift certificate for Christmas and bought this DVD. I watched it last night for the second time and was even more impressed. So much detail and forethought into the drawings and characters. There is a scene, in the beginning, where the male lead takes his bow off his shoulder and restrings it. I mean, how many illustrators would think of that? Most ""cartoons"" would just have the person shooting the bow. The shadows, the fog and rain...amazing artwork. But it isn't that alone. The stroy is really good and send a good message on protecting the planet. I have not watched the English-speaking part yet...I just love hearing the Japanese inflections. Could not believe how much strong language was used. Cursing on a cartoon? I didn't mind it. It fit the scene but I am guessing that the English-speaking option does not have it especially since Disney now owns it.

Certainly, many of his actions are what one might call evil or lead to evil, but i'm sure he doesn't think of himself as anything but a business man.Is the Lady of Irontown, who wants to kill the Forest Gods (demiurges incarnate as huge talking animals) and destroy the forest, so that she can mine ore more easily, evil?  Certainly, evil will come of *that* plan -- but the community she wants the ore to support consists in large part of girls she has rescued from brothels and lepers whom no-one else will take in, whom she has not only taken in but made respected and respectable members of society, which certainly indicates she is something other than evil incarnate.Are the Forest Gods themselves, turning fang and claw and tusk against humanity, battling in blind fury when nothing else seems possible, evil?  Hardly.  But they are representative of a way that *must* pass with the coming of humanity, and hard as it seems, their time is over.Is ""the system"" evil? Is human civilisation, in and of itself, evil?Is it possible to reduce the whole issue, as Buffy does at one point on TV as ""Fire bad -- Tree pretty"", saying that wildness and trees take precedence over human progress and expansion?Or, conversely, to assert that, *of course* humanity's needs take precedence over those of nature and wilderness?The answer -- to either of the last two questions -- of course, is ""No, it isn't.""  Everything must proceed by compromise, in balance, or we and the world we live in will go down to disaster.The earlier parts of this film look as if it may turn out to be a pure tree-hugger's ""ecology"" spiel, but by the end, it is obvious that the survivors (on both human and forest sides) have taken the lessons of their adventures to heart, and are probably going to manage to come to some sort of modus vivendi that will enable both to exist and to interfere only minimally with each other.Would the real world could learn such lessons.((BTW -- i didn't read the subtitles, i listened to the English-dubbed version [which is excellent in terms of sound quality and voice selection], and i didn't notice anyone being referred to as ""Princess Mononoke"" or any variant thereupon.

522103,A1WX42M589VAMQ,B00003CXBK,Mir,"[5, 5]","I had only seen two works by Miyazaki prior to Princess Mononoke. I already knew that Studio Ghibli produced really terrific anime, and that Miyazaki had a knack for presenting film moments that make us sign in that part of us that senses wonder.This film has, bar none other, one of the most enthrallingly magical sequences I have ever seen: the section in the heart of the forest where we see the forest spirit as NightWalker. These few cinematic moments were, to me as a Christian, almost holy. The film is of a different myth/religion, but it captures that ineffable, that transcendant, that wordless experience where part of you KNOWS that there is truth there, that there is something beyond atoms and molecules, and it is powerful and necessary and benevolent (although it can destroy, as we later see with the Forest Spirit). It is a moment that made me think of 60's psychedlia--a bit--and the special taste of clean night winds in moonlight--a bit--and the way you feel when you've prayed a powerful prayer.You have to see it to understand. It's the combination of color, music, pacing, editing, expression, and the sheer otherness of this deity (I'm not Japanese, so the Forest Spirit, tree spirits, these things have a strangeness that was exhilirating.) I don't really know how to analyze properly how Miyazaki did it, but he captures a holy moment that transcends the story itself. Amazing.Anyway, this site has numerous summaries of the plot. I'll spare you mine. I'll simply say that the outworking of this quest story, a story of man vs. nature, man vs himself, and the place of humanity within the natural context, is very powerful and extremely beautiful. Even dubbed, you will be captivated.There is a moment near the end where there is this pause--many seconds passing when you wait, wait, wait and the screen seems not to change. And you find yourself hoping, praying for a change. And when the first perceptible changes come, it's such a relief. Such an answer to prayer.This film is like an answer to prayer. It says things we need to listen to, and it can speak to folks outside of the Japanese culture and the nature religions. Good is sometimes supremely good here, and evil is...not always purely evil. Sometimes, it's just ignorant or selfish or unthinking...or somehow motivated by higher motives. And that shows a filmmaker with compassion and understanding of how people work. And of how the larger cosmos works, too.I can't recommend it too strongly. A work of art.Mir",5,"Astounding, magical.

Of course, that applies to almost anything that Hayao Miyazaki does.Ashitaka is inflicted with a curse after a demon attacks his village.  Now, because he must find a way to save himself, he leaves his village forever to find the source of the demon.  A place far away that appears to be filled with hate.  But when he gets there he finds a battle being waged between the gods and spirits of the forest, and the people at Irontown who are trying to make a living for themselves.  And there's a plot to destroy the forest spirit, which could have all kinds of unforseen consequences.Characters:Billy Crudup: AshitakaClaire Danes: SanMinnie Driver: Lady EboshiBilly Bob Thorton: JigoWhen watching an animated film, I have to admit, I'm not really that concerned about the voices.  Because they're animated, I don't have any initial expectations on how they should sound.  So in my opinion, everbody did a good job of voicing their characters in this movie.  The characters themselves were varied and I love their personalities.  You have Ashitaka, the good guy, who is brave and strong and tries to do what is right all the time.  San, Princess Mononoke, is very strong in her convictions and vicious at the same time.  I like that she was the wild one as opposed to having Ashitaka being the wild one.  And Lady Eboshi, well if there was ever a ""grey"" character she was it.  She did so many things wrong but her heart was in the right place for a lot of it.  You just couldn't hate her despite what she was doings.  Simply amazing.The plot is a common one.  The ""earth"" against the humans trying to destroy it.  But the humans are likable.  Which just confuses everything.  Add into this a little bit of a love story, some humor, and being that all think they are doing the right thing, and you have an epic story right there.  And I think the paces moves quite well.  It's not too slow, but it doesn't rush by so fast that you can't understand what is going on.  And let's be honest, anything with Kodomas (tree spirits) is just awesome.  I've always hoped they'd make an alarm clock shaped like a Kodoma that rattled its head as the alarm.  I would buy it in an instant.I always like that in Miyazaki's work, you know it's animated, but at times there is animation that almost looks real.  Like the ripples of wind through tall grass or waves on the water.  It really adds to the experience.  And the colors are always bright and vibrant.  Lots of reds.  It's a real pleasure to view.  And the music is always understated and in the background, but it doesn't detract from the movie.  And just the images themselves are unique.  The Forest Spirit, the Kodomas, they are all interesting shapes and creatures with lots of detail.This is one of my favorite movies and one that actually has a permanent place on my shelf.  It never gets old.Review by M.

When this film was released in the U.S. it was chocked full Hollywood names for the voice-overs, and distributed by Miramax Studios. It was celebrated by critics and loved by audiences....and ""Princess Mononoke"" isn't a bad film. I don't see how it became so popular in Japan though. It's PG-13 rating gives it away that it's strictly for profit and not for art. For having that rating it pushed the envelope as close as it could, which is a plus. The film, however, was marred by over length. The film wasn't bad, the story was rather interesting at times, it had two stories going on at once. It did slow down near the end, it could have been 20 or 30 minutes shorter, and I'm not exaggerating. Besides the conclusion the film is pretty well done, the animation is clean, the colors are lush. It's much brighter than most Anime, which isn't necessarily a good thing, but it works well with the film.

Pretty much all of it (after the DVD release) has been positive, so I won't waste much time on that aspect in this review. All I can say is that it's an amazing movie, and from such a simple, yet intriguing concept. This, as said in other reviews is not Ghost or Akira, but then it's not trying to be, and doesn't need to be in that genre to succeed. This is a film which at first seems to follow a standard format, good versus bad, but on closer inspection, and through repeated viewing, the characters seem neither good nor bad, but all viewing the world through their own eyes and so justifying their actions according to their own situations and understandings. All trying to prosper and make the best for themselves with their limited view of the world. Truly it is only Ashitaka who can see the whole picture and attempts to unite the factions under this, to truly bring together the civilised world and the forest like in the past. This is the work of Hayao Miyazaki the same artist who gave us Nausicaa, and the quality and depth of the story shows. In fact anyone who is familiar with Nausicaa Of The Valley Of The Wind, will be familiar with this quality of work, and the flow and depth of the story is similar, both in ideas and content. In both stories a lone warrior struggles to better the world for all people. This is not a post-apocalyptic tale, or the story of a civilisation nearing collapse, it's the story of two worlds trying to be reunited through the efforts of the few. This is both an excellent movie and a very good DVD with some worthwhile extras. If you're new to Anime, or if you don't buy another animated titles this year, then please make sure you buy this one. If you think that maybe this is not your thing as it is animated, try to move past that and appreciate the film for what it is. It is not a childs cartoon, it is simply that the Japanese choose to animate most of their features, as in this format the film can become more expressive than in live action pictures.

522120,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00003CXBK,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[29, 33]","Master filmmaker Miyazaki has created one of the most beautiful animated movies I've ever seen. Frankly, I'm beyond impressed. Anime seems to have a much more realistic feel and the themes are very adult in nature. With intellectual themes, magical creatures and mature relationship issues, this is one captivating movie.Even though the film doesn't make judgments about good or evil, it does make a statement that pervades the entire story. The message is ecological in nature and asks many questions about the role of humans and animals on the planet. The characters have to deal with loyalty, fate and death. The characters are really not trying to save the planet, they are dealing more with survival issues.Princess Mononoke was raised by wolves on a mountain. She wears a fur type coat with ears attached. Very cute. The mountain is ruled by the forest spirit who never speaks, but has the power to give or take life. The tiny forest spirits that rattle their heads are adorable. They are like little ghosts. The forest spirit changes shape at night and when he walks through the forest as a ""deer god,"" flowers grow around his hooves.The forest is so beautiful it is not difficult to see why the animals want to preserve the pristine location. The animals all talk and are larger than most animals. In fact, they are actually gods defending their mountains. There is quite a bit of violence so this is not really an animated movie for children. They might be a bit frightened by the boar crawling with demon worms or the huge explosion that kills the boars.Ashitaka takes up the role of warrior and kills a demon-boar monster threatening his village. In killing this angry beast, he is cursed and retains a marking on his skin from the battle. When he arrives in the forest, he finds himself torn between helping the animals and helping the humans.""Ashitaka: Look, everyone! This is what hatred looks like! This is what it does when it catches hold of you! It's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me! Fear and anger only make it grow faster!""I think it is honor that drives him to help the women of Irontown. I don't think he really is fighting on the side of Lady Eboshi. At least we don't want him to because she is after all trying to kill the forest spirit. I think Ashitaka is trying to take both sides or is at least trying to promote peace. He sees that humans need to work to make a living and that might include chopping down a few trees. The wolf tells him that when the trees are chopped down they cry. I don't like chopping down trees, but I don't think they cry. ;) That was when the movie went off into a more mythological interpretation.While Princess Mononoke takes the side of the wild boar tribe, Ashitaka takes the side of the outcasts working in an iron mine.A much more realistic feel than most Disney animations. This also has a much deeper emotional appeal for adults.I could have watched the dragonflies and butterflies in this movie for a much longer period of time.

Do not allow conventional thoughts about animation to prevent you from seeing it. It tells an epic story set in medieval Japan, at the dawn of the Iron Age, when some men still lived in harmony with nature and others were trying to tame and defeat it.

I went to see this one because it drew solid reviews in the U.S., and because I happen to believe that all good films have certain storytelling elements in common,  regardless of genre:  strong characters, a well-crafted story, and pace, to  name a few.  PRINCESS MONONOKE nails the first one, falls short on the  second, and fails miserably on the third.Let's start with the good  things:  first of all, the animation is beautiful.  Every hand-painted  frame of this film is clearly the work of an artist and a perfectionist.  Three of the main characters form an intriguing psychological triangle--the  young, heroic Ashitaka, the mysterious San (who is also the title  character), and the icy Lady Eboshi.  Early on, the quality of the artwork  and the appeal of the personalities involved fooled me into thinking that I  was watching a great adventure film.Then the story went on.  And on.  And on.  I must have memorized every distinguishing mark on my watch from  checking it so many times.  Look, I don't mind an intricate storyline; I  happen to be a big fan of gratifyingly complex plots.  But a GOOD complex  plot has craft, coherence, and shape; it also has a clear sense of where  it's going, and it doesn't bore you to death as it's trying to get there.  PRINCESS MONONOKE isn't content with 90 minutes' worth of material; no,  anything less than epic scale would be unacceptable.  Unfortunately, it's  so heavy-handed and self-indulgent, so lacking in any sense of narrative  structure, that it feels remarkably turgid and unenergetic despite the  large helpings of action and violence.Visually inventive?  Yes.  Wondrous to behold?  Without a doubt.  Da Vinci himself could have painted  every landscape in this film and it still would have been a bloody mess.  It has no pace.  It has no subtlety.  It has no restraint.  It has none of  the qualities necessary to take a well-animated epic and turn it into a  truly great--no, that's aiming too high--an even remotely satisfactory  experience.  Note to the multitude of diehard anim&eacute; fans who will no doubt  be infuriated by my lack of respect for this ""masterpiece"":  I may not be  crazy about the genre, but I believe that it's just like any other  genre--capable of great things, so long as a little economy is applied.

But the reason I'm writing this review is to clarify as to what is an anime film. &quot;Guardianangel&quot; includes Mulan when he/she compares other &quot;anime&quot; movies he/she has seen, showing a misunderstanding in what is an anime flick. Mulan's not anime, its american animation. The term anime applies ONLY to japanese animation (sometimes called japanimation, also), so you can scratch all disney, WB, or dreamworks animated films as being &quot;anime&quot;. There is also the misunderstanding as to what extent anime movies go. Because what we see in america is mostly pokemon, dragonball z, sailor moon, etc., this gives the wrong impression as to how good and serious the anime films can be. In Japan, animation is both for kids AND adults (mononoke being an example), so you get both dragonballz (for kids) and princess mononoke(not for kids).

As a child, I watched those &quot;mecca&quot; transformation cartoons like &quot;Robotech&quot; and &quot;Voltron&quot;. If grown-up,  &quot;heady&quot; stuff like Mononoke Hime was around back in the early  80's, I never saw it. I'm rather new to the whole &quot;serious&quot; anime  stuff and after hearing consistantly glowing reviews about this movie, I  had to see it for myself. What can I say? It's an unusual film. A little  weird. But the animation flows a little smoother than most other anime I've  seen and the depth of character certainly goes beyond much of the silly  American cartoons. Some of the plot was hard for me to follow but as my  first cimematic experience of Japanese animation goes, I eventually liked  it. It kind of reminded me of the dreadful &quot;Ferngully: The Last  Rainforest&quot; but this film goes way beyond that into a whole new  territory of quality. I enjoyed it's surreal nature as well. There were  extended scenes where there was no dialogue. Just dreamlike images of water  moving and the wind blowing through the trees and sky. I like animation  that isn't always so talky. &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; was like that  and it was beautiful. I enjoy it when animators allow facial expressions  and movement to sub for dialogue for awhile. Anyway, sometimes when I come  out of a film, it takes me a little while to decide if I really enjoyed it  or not. I have to think about the images I saw and the story. That was the  case with Mononoke Hime. But in the end I really did like it. It was  different, (well, here in America anyway), as far as &quot;forest&quot;  movies go. I pre-ordered the DVD and after seeing this, I don't even want  to see Disney's &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

First of all, the entire film is  genuinely startling in it's originality, and not something you would ever  see in an American-made film.  Also, it's good to know that although this  movie does have a fair amount of violence in it, unlike most anime films it  isn't all that graphic, (except in one scene at about the twenty minute  mark) and the violence only serves to further the story, and not vice  versa.  It's also interesting to note that this is a somewhat feminist  story.  If you've watched anime before, you probably know how poorly the  female characters are treated.  This one perhaps consciously avoids that,  and actually makes the two major women in the movie figures of authority.  This is not to say that it seems to be going out of it's way; it's just  interesting in retrospect.  Oh, and if you're worried about buying an  English of the original Japanese film, don't worry at all.  Not only do the  mouth movements of the character match the dialogue, but the dialogue  actually feels very fluid, in sharp contrast to most anime translations.  And the voice acting is excellent, especially by Billy Crudup and Minnie  Driver.  All things considered, I can't imagine why anyone who likes  animation not loving this movie.

At the time, the only anime I cared about was brainless ninja stuff with super powers. But after seeing the DVD, I'm kicking myself for not experiencing this on the big-screen. In a weird sort of way, the story is actually more political than theological, even with the gods and demons and talking animals.This is the kind of movie that should really be held up as a shining example of Japanese animation.  It has a beautiful story, realistic characters, and a great mix of cell and computer animation. Even the English voice cast was terrific, which is something I almost never say. It also doesn't hurt when the original script is adapted by comics legend Neil Gaiman, who has a real respect for the work.It's unfortunate that ""Mononoke"" wasn't as big a success over here as it was in Japan (where it was narrowly beaten out by ""Titanic"").

522144,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00003CXBK,Sebastian Fernandez,"[7, 7]","Hayao Miyazaki has created a film that places among the best I have ever seen, and I am not limiting my comparison to the anime genre. The director presents the fight of good vs. evil not only through different characters, but also related to the conflict in one of the main characters (Ashitaka). The concept is similar to the one used in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but in this film Ashitaka is still trying to contain the inner demon and prevent it from coming out.Right from the start we are mesmerized by the beautiful colors and animation, with crisp drawings and scenes of bliss. Miyazaki is very crafty in using this tool, together with well-chosen music to depict the mood of each scene. But happiness has an end, and in this case, the small village that was portrayed so lively, is attacked by a demon from the forest. Ashitaka is in place and tries to stop this demon before it reaches the village, being partly successful in his attempt. He gets to destroy the demon before he can kill all of his loved ones, but he also touches it in the process. This means that now he is doomed to be overtaken by the evil spirits and die an awful death.This sense of fatality is not unknown in the epic anime genre, and usually we get to see the main characters go on a quest that is impossible to achieve. This case is not different, and even though the Oracle tells Ashitaka that he cannot change his fate, she mentions that there may be an alternative by going west and facing the calamity of Mikado (evil demon) to lift the curse. So Ashitaka leaves the village knowing he should never return.That is when the classic epic adventure starts, and we go on a journey through a forest full of fantastic creatures, gods and demons. One of these ""creatures"" is no other than Princess Mononoke, a young girl whose soul the wolf stole, and who has vowed to kill the wolf's enemy, Lady Eboshi. The relationship that develops between Ashitaka and Mononoke is a complex one, and Miyazaki uses the disturbed nature of these characters masterfully to make the story even more interesting.When you put together a great story, with impeccable animation, appropriate music that complements the action perfectly and a few surprises here and there, the result is a movie that is top notch. Therefore, the only thing left to say is that I highly recommend this film, it is a must see!",5,"""You shall know my hatred and my grief""",1119312000,"06 21, 2005",2005,2365,"['Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'created', 'film', 'best', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'am', 'not', 'limiting', 'comparison', 'anime', 'genre', 'director', 'fight', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'not', 'only', 'different', 'characters', 'also', 'related', 'conflict', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Ashitaka', 'concept', 'similar', 'one', 'used', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'film', 'Ashitaka', 'still', 'trying', 'contain', 'inner', 'demon', 'prevent', 'coming', 'out.Right', 'start', 'are', 'mesmerized', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'animation', 'crisp', 'drawings', 'scenes', 'bliss', 'Miyazaki', 'very', 'crafty', 'using', 'tool', 'together', 'well-chosen', 'music', 'depict', 'mood', 'scene', 'happiness', 'end', 'case', 'small', 'village', 'was', 'portrayed', 'so', 'lively', 'attacked', 'demon', 'forest', 'Ashitaka', 'place', 'tries', 'stop', 'demon', 'village', 'being', 'partly', 'successful', 'attempt', 'destroy', 'demon', 'can', 'kill', 'loved', 'ones', 'also', 'process', 'now', 'doomed', 'be', 'overtaken', 'evil', 'spirits', 'die', 'awful', 'death.This', 'sense', 'fatality', 'not', 'unknown', 'epic', 'anime', 'genre', 'usually', 'get', 'see', 'main', 'characters', 'go', 'quest', 'impossible', 'achieve', 'case', 'not', 'different', 'even', 'Oracle', 'Ashitaka', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'fate', 'may', 'be', 'alternative', 'going', 'west', 'facing', 'calamity', 'Mikado', 'evil', 'demon', 'lift', 'curse', 'Ashitaka', 'village', 'knowing', 'should', 'never', 'return.That', 'when', 'classic', 'epic', 'adventure', 'go', 'journey', 'forest', 'full', 'fantastic', 'creatures', 'gods', 'demons', 'One', 'creatures', 'other', 'Princess', 'Mononoke', 'young', 'girl', 'soul', 'wolf', 'stole', 'who', 'vowed', 'kill', 'wolf', 'enemy', 'Lady', 'Eboshi', 'relationship', 'Ashitaka', 'Mononoke', 'complex', 'one', 'Miyazaki', 'disturbed', 'nature', 'characters', 'masterfully', 'make', 'story', 'even', 'more', 'interesting.When', 'put', 'together', 'great', 'story', 'impeccable', 'animation', 'appropriate', 'music', 'action', 'perfectly', 'few', 'surprises', 'here', 'there', 'result', 'movie', 'top', 'notch', 'Therefore', 'only', 'thing', 'left', 'say', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'must', 'see']",Princess Mononoke

522148,A1L8HRCM60W0W7,B00003CXBK,Shashank Tripathi,"[5, 8]","The reviews for this typical Miyazaki blockbuster are so rabidly of the WOW mentality that you may expect something mind-blowing. 'Manage your expectations and enjoy the bloody ride' is my advice.In terms of sheer execution this is one of the best anime capers you'll see, replete with beasts of mythic proportions, lush forests, sparkling waterfalls, and some mind-numbing inter-galactic slaughter. I could wager in a blink that this is what inspired Tarantino to do that little anime insert in Kill Bill Vol 1.Plus, the film has some swank credentials under its belt: the Japanese voices are dubbed, not just subtitled, by big *American* stars -- Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Bill Crudup, etc -- who lend their laryx to a host of universally relevant issues such as the plight of indigenous people and nature in the face of unchecked business interests, the death of spirituality in the name of social progress, misogyny in its many variations, etc.But I have my gripes. The film is violent. Very violent. Sometimes senselessly violent. I had to frequently turn my volume knob to the left. There are gigantic guns, and blood and guts splatter the landscape every minute. Most of this soon seems overdrawn (and the film is looooong) with all this supposedly cool action amounting to precious little in terms of any clear message about good versus evil. The underlying purpose is summed up brilliantly by a roadside beggar when he says something like the world is cursed, but we still find a reason to live.I also found something lacking in the animation itself. While exquisitely vivid it seems to lag in its flair for capturing natural motion. Disney or Pixar movies  pore over a sense of suppleness when an eye is raised or a muscle is twitched by a character. Miyazaki's animators on the other hand haven't penetrated beyond the skin, the moving creatures feel inarticulate and jerky, particularly when played against the very 2D painted backgrounds.But that still doesn't stop me from recommending this powerful cult flick, a must if you're an anime acolyte.

O'Blenis,"[9, 9]","One of the darkest and most intense Studio Ghibli masterpieces, ""Princess Mononoke"" is every bit as vast and grand as ""Lord Of The Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and rivals fellow Ghibli fare like ""Castle In the Sky"" and ""Spirited Away"" in memorabilty and array of character (both human and nonhuman), creature and concept.  The film's character cast is headed by Mononoke, a wolf-raised girl involved in the resistance of animals and nature against the ever-encroaching and ever-dominating human civilization, and Ashitaka, afflicted with a life-draining malady and on a quest deep into the remaining forest to find the elusive cure.  Being a Miyazaki-directed feature, ""Princess Mononoke"" still manages to easily blend in large amounts of beauty, cuteness and charm into the darkly serious and often violent story of conflict.  The struggle between relentless human industrialization & expansion and the vanishing natural world is a common theme in many Ghibli movies, but seldom presented in such a warlike and apocalyptic fashion.  Interestingly, it does this without demonizing the encroaching human factions.  As in our world, in this admittedly less technologically advanced world, the enivirornmental decimation isn't always caused by a burning malicious desire to eradicate our planetmates, but out of - what?  Arrogance?  Honest ignorance?  Unconscious apathy?  A defeatist attitude that it's all going to be plowed over anyway so why bother trying to delay the inevitable?  Unfortunately, it's the other 99.999% of species that have to suffer the bulk of the consequences.  In ""Princess Mononoke"", the 99.999% are in the early stages of not taking things lying down anymore, and are being aided by some very powerful entities, and the result is one of cinema's greatest epics, aided by impeccable animation and great voice acting flawlessly synchronized into the movie.

The story, which begins seemingly prototypically as a maturation story, somehow entwines us into a world of interwoven morals and sadness.  It tells of that age when the world lost its innocence and simplicity and became victim to the complexity of human existence.  It seems almost to reflect back sadly on the day that mankind began to treat nature with ambiguity, respectful of its beauty and wonder, yet pragmatic in recognizing the resources it contained.The story is very sharp and (save for some early scenes of violence) not at all stereotypical.  There are only a few characters that we view as having a certain moral turpitude, most of the main characters instead being utterly human in their ways and actions.The dialogue is profound at times, light and entertaining at others.  It seems to be more philosophical and sophisticated than the dialogue we would expect from modern characters, because perhaps the world is not yet so pragmatic.The artwork is spectacular at times, mostly due to the creativity and wonder that the director has infused into it.

The transfer is very good, the sound adequate, and there is a short, mildly interesting featurette, with comments by the English-speaking actors (Billy Bob Thornton, Billy Crudup, Jada Pinkett Smith) and the Dubbing Director (who states the dominant themes of the film, such as ""to explore man's relationship with nature"").The dubbing job is OK, but not great.  However, Minnie Driver did a very good job as Lady Eboshi.Director Hayao Miyazaki (who created the fabulous My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away, and Kiki's Delivery Service) has written and directed a film with a suspenseful story, compelling characters, uplifting music, and beautiful artwork, with misty mountains, scenic countrysides with rice paddies, mossy forests with sunlight streaming through the trees, and dramatic battles in the rain.The noble heroes, Prince Ashitaka (from a tribe that was ""almost wiped out 500 years earlier"") and Princess Mononoke (brought up by a gigantic white wolf-goddess in the woods), are courageous, virtuous, respectful of the spiritual world, and want to protect nature--against the encroachments of ""civilization."" Some of the other characters are greedy or suspicious, but none are evil. Lady Eboshi, for example, wants to kill the Great Forest Spirit, but eventually sees the error of her ways, and also treats lepers well and purchases the contracts of prostitutes, giving them jobs in the iron-smelting works. Her troops also defend Irontown against the samurai army of a voracious lord.There are a few gory battle scenes and the demons are a bit scary, and you might want younger children to wait until they get a little older to view this film. On the other hand, some of the forest spirits can be quite charming, especially the ones with the revolving, clicking heads.The story can get complicated. There are numerous gods and human characters, but the theme of ""civilization versus nature"" is simple. Lady Eboshi wants to cut down the forests and bring more civilization (i.e., mining, industry, agriculture, and towns) to the world. Prince Ashitaka, from an endangered, persecuted people, is a natural ally to the threatened forest spirits. When he is infected by a demon that has possessed a boar god, his quest to cure himself propels him into the battle between the forces of nature and civilization, and he tries to get the humans to co-exist with nature.The great battle between the boar army and the humans (shown in flashback) is majestic and exciting. The boars are bedecked in white war paint and helped by Princess Mononoke and two wolf cub gods. The concluding scenes, with the Great Forest Spirit searching for its head, are done magnificently.This is a film that your family will love, and want to see many times.

522163,A2RHQMV5GD18Z8,B00003CXBK,Steven Aldersley,"[2, 3]","Princess Mononoke (animation, adventure, fantasy)Directed by Hayao MiyazakiStarring the voices of Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Clare Danes and Minnie DriverMiramax | 1999 | 133 min | Rated PG-13 | Released Dec 19, 2000The Film 4.5/5Here's another film from Studio Ghibli that hasn't yet seen a Blu-ray release. If you read my recent review of My Neighbor Totoro, you'll know that I love Miyazaki's animation, themes and characterization. This film has a different feel to Totoro and is aimed at older audiences.The story lasts 133 minutes and is quite violent in places. The opening scene shows a boar possessed by a demon, which is an immediate threat to a village. Ashitaka (Crudup) tackles the beast and ultimately kills it, but injures his right arm in the process. The arm is essentially possessed and the infection is expected to spread throughout his body, killing him. He's a danger to his own people and reluctantly has to leave in search of a cure.Like most of Miyazaki's characters, Ashitaka is a good person. One clue to his character is the way he treats Yakul, the red elk that he rides. The two seem like partners and it's clear that he loves the animal.Further clues to Ashitaka's character can be seen when he saves another village from attack and rescues two drowning men from a river. We see that his infected arm seems to have additional strength and that enemies hit by his arrows can be decapitated. As I mentioned at the outset, the film is aimed at older audiences than those targeted by Totoro. It's bloody and violent in places and death is always a possibility.The first magical scene takes place in a forest. The locals fear it and the tree spirits that live there, but Ashitaka has no such fears. He sees the tree spirits as happy and childlike and willingly follows their directions. They lead him and the injured men to safety. He also catches a glimpse of the Forest Spirit, which is an altogether more powerful entity and has a big role to play in the story.Ashitaka returns the men to their town and is thanked by the town's ruler, Lady Eboshi (Driver). She's one of the most interesting characters in the story. She's capable of giving people a chance where others wouldn't and has taken in prostitutes and lepers and given them honorable roles in her town. But she's also fiercely ambitious and thinks she's powerful enough to kill gods to gain more wealth and power. She's a truly divided woman, but not definitely good or evil. She does seem to genuinely want to help the people under her care and protection. Her character changes significantly by the end of the story.Princess Mononoke has been raised by a wolf-god (Anderson) and regularly rides one of its two cubs. She hates humans because she only ever sees them harming the forest. Her character is wild and reckless and will attack the town in an attempt to stop the people causing further damage to her beloved forest. She feels that if she kills Lady Eboshi, the threat will cease to exist.Miyazaki's animation doesn't look modern. It has the look of a watercolor painting and is simply drawn; but with simple drawings, he's capable of expressing a lot of emotion. When Ashitaka looks at his elk, the animal looks friendly, loving and intelligent. Its gaze and simple expression conveys all kinds of positive feelings. The forest is also a beautiful place and you'll find that you want to see it protected and unharmed. The tree sprites project joy and innocence and that innocence is a common theme in Miyazaki's work. I'm not sure how he does it, but it's powerful and moving.The final act is full of action and a number of key characters suffer major wounds. It's not clear who will live and who will die, but not everyone survives. Some of the animals in the story are much more than dumb beasts and many are gods capable of mutual respect when they encounter souls who deserve it. There's a sense of that respect throughout the film and the characters live by their own honor code.Miyazaki places us right in the middle of the action and commonly uses a panning technique as if the frames were filmed instead of drawn. He also takes his time establishing scenes and it's common to see water ripple, grass wave in the wind or clouds move across the sky. He seems to revel in the beauty of his worlds and I find that it helps me appreciate it all the more.The conclusion of the story feels satisfying and right. It's not a contrived ending at all, but one which could actually happen given the personalities of the characters and their situation. It's interesting that Miyazaki's villains usually consist of misguided people rather than truly evil individuals. This is often the case in real life and it works better than having a stock villain like those found in most animated movies.The actors do a good job in the English version, but the Japanese dub is included with English subtitles for anyone wishing to experience the original version.I have only seen Princess Mononoke three times and found it a bit muddled the first time. It improved with each viewing and I now consider it just below Miyazaki's very best work. If you thought My Neighbor Totoro and Ponyo were too childish, give this a try.Let's hope that a Blu-ray release isn't too far away.Overall score 4.5/5",5,"Raised by wolves, but ultimately

An excellent cast of actors was used, although some will complain about how well these actors fit the parts, I think you have to accept that the English actors will have to be somewhat  different if you go for big names and this doesn't necessarily make them worse. The script was translated very well and was rewritten in some places to account for cultural differences, resulting in one of the most natural and understandable english versions. The soundtrack to this movie also shines, featuring some simple but beautiful melodies and a mostly western classical score with some integration of eastern instruments.The visuals are the best you will see in an anime released in the US, period. Smooth, vibrant animation, some CG tricks and gorgeous depictions of the nature that the story takes place in.The DVD also has a few extra features: an interview with the cast and the trailer.

522165,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00003CXBK,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[5, 12]","Hayao Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" has a sophistication to it that will appeal to viewers who demand more complex themes in their animated fare.  Yet, despite its technical brilliance, the film is unfortunately hindered by a story that is not as focused as it could have been.At the dawn of the Age of Iron in Japan, a boar-creature is defeated by a young prince named Ashitaka (voiced by Yji Matsuda).  Even though he is victorious, Ashitaka emerges from the battle afflicted with a curse that will eventually kill him.  To cure himself, the prince must seek out the Forest Spirit.  In the course of his travels, Ashitaka meets San (voiced by Yuriko Ishida), the daughter of the wolf god, and finds himself in the middle of a battle between the forest creatures and the encroaching humans.The notion in ""Princess Mononoke"" that human beings lose their special relationship with nature once they turn toward industrialization is one that is obviously relevant to our modern society.  Additionally, the idea that lovers should part for the good of each another when they cannot assimilate into each other's life is a very mature take on relationships.  However, while ""Princes Mononoke"" should be lauded with tacking such insightful concepts, it loses points for a rather pedestrian script that fails to develop its story to a satisfying level.  There is just too much abstractness and awkward symbolism at work to declare the film a success.  Miyazaki's animation is top notch and even breathtaking in certain parts but all the imagination and artistic talent in the world cannot cover up all the shortcomings in the storytelling.",2,"""I wish the wolves had eaten you!

This quality is consistent throughout, even the voice acting in English was done well; one of the bonus features briefly addressed the difficulty in maintaining the correct verbal pacing with the animation -- the Japanese language having a quicker cadence. The visual perspective is beautifully done, giving a real sense of scale in pull away shots. The story is slightly preachy about nature conservation but not overly so and the ending is honest.Now, for the reason I give this four stars and not five... personally I feel Miyazaki's Nausicaa story was much better along the same vein (although the English dubbing of Nausicaa was horrendous) and it was difficult for me not to compare the two. In spite of the bonus interviews, I felt that Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver was very good in the role) was not balanced enough makling her resolution at the end a bit disjointed.It also seemed a hair too long, I know I'll get flack for this especially since I wanted more character development for Eboshi but I did glance at my watch at times and thought perhaps Ashitaka's first entry leading the wounded men into the forrest as well his healing later on could have been slightly abbreviated.Minor quibbles aside, I am glad to recommend such a quality anime and fine film.

I just finished watching it for third time and I can easily say it looks just as beautiful now in 2012 as it did when I first watched it years ago. It was the most expensive anime release of its time and it shows.I won't comment on the English dubbing of the film since I only watch it in Japanese, and this is the way I would recommend everyone watch anime. There are so many nuances that get lost in the dubbing process. It doesn't matter what the origin language of a film is, it will ALWAYS be better than the dub. I have heard English-origin movies which were dubbed into Japanese and they're not as good as the English. I am not biased towards the Japanese language, I just think the original language the movie was made in is better and more believable in all aspects. Subtitles are not difficult to get used to.

Not only is this film the 2nd highest grossing film in Japan, it is also the film that finally gave Studio Ghibili notice in the United States.'Princess Mononoke' shows the epic battle of man against nature and how the constant motion of human evolution has the ability to destroy the purity of nature. Though there are no physical elements of good against evil the true villans in this film are greed, power and anger. You see characters like Asuyaka, who comes from a race of humans that have strong bonds with nature. Lady Hiboshi who wants to move the human race forward with science and technology only to create the perfect human utopia. Then you have Princess Mononoke, a girl who was tossed by her parents to the wolf gods out of fear, but only to be raised as a daughter of nature and learn the magic of the ancient ways. These characters clash for the purpose of moving forward, but also for the chance to co-exist. I feel that is what makes this film so appealing because of the similariteis in life. The topics of polotics, science and religion always cause a stir in us eventhough there can be ways to have them all work united.This was a diffenent film for Miyazaki, but you still manage to see the magical elements that make his signature work. It is a film rich in detail and emotion. You get lost in the vast landscapes and the relationships of the characters you sometimes forget you are watching an animated film.

At times I've seen some great ones, like Sprited Away, and then gone out looking for more and been disappointed with a lot of silliness. This film, though, is another great version of Japanese anime for an adultish audience. This is not for small kids. It's complex, at times gruesome, and much of the imagery and lore will be very unfamiliar to Western audiences. But that's what's so wonderful about it for the right audience. It's fantasy from an entirely different perspective, with spirits and talking animals and demons. There's also quite an anti-industrialization and pro-environmentalist message to this. Maybe none of the ingredients by themselves explain why this is so different and unusual. I think, really, it's that in the Western World so much of our reference points for fantasy come from Tolkein, CS Lewis, etc - writers who wrote inspired by an Anglo tradition. So we're use to certain types of wizards, obvious good and bad guys, heroic behaviour of a certain type. But with Japanese anime all bets are off.

522198,A9AX1D31T7J1S,B00003CXBK,Zachary Gochenour,"[11, 12]","First, some concessions.  I do not speak Japanese, so I can say nothing about the Japanese language version or the quality of the translation.  Also, I am not an rabid anime fan, and in fact this was the first japanese-animated feature film I ever saw (I have seen more since).  Finally, this movie takes maturity to watch and appreciate - there is some graphic animated violence and mature themes throughout.  Now, on to the review.This animated film by Hayao Miyazaki is absolutely amazing. It embodies all the things you should look for in animation, and it stands as one of the greatest films - and, along with Ran (directed by Kurosawa), my favorite film from Japan.  First, let me say that the story was terrific, using developed characters and tackling real-world problems of environmentalism and technology tastefully and without an abundance of feel-good Sierra-club nonsense a la Captain Planet and Ferngully.  It explores humanity's relationship with nature, the struggle for human survival, and the difficulties of human advancement.  While there is a large degree of sentimentalism (Randians beware) the story should appeal to a wide range of audiences.The most amazing thing about the movie is the art and art direction, all masterfully done.  The entire movie is a feast for the eyes, both characters and backgrounds are drawn with fascinating detail and rich, crisp color.  The artistic and directorial talent deserves the utmost respect.  You'll have to see the movie to believe how good it is.The sound is well done, but for those of you wanting to utilize your overly expensive surround sound systems, you'll find yourself missing out (sorry).  The sounds are crisp, though, and complement the visual experience beautifully.  The music is a chapter all to itself, both complementing the other senses and leading your emotions throughout the whole film.The voice talent is mixed.  Americans will certainly recognize Jada Pinkett Smith (horrible), Minnie Driver (excellent), Billy Bob Thorton (so-so), and Claire Daines (excellent).  A fellow reviewer claims that the poor voice actors hurt the movie beyond repair, but this is nonsense.  The dubbing is excellent (read: does not look stupid and mismatched).  Regarding translation, see the concessions.This movie showcases japanese animation and animation in general.  The crispness of sound, enchantment of music, and vividness of color make this film a thrill ride for the senses.  The movie avoids the problem of having many things happening at once, and clearly shows what is happening even during the fast-paced battle scenes -- a sure sign of directorial experience.  Praise for Hayao Miyazaki is practically neverending.If you enjoy Japanese animation, you probably already own this film.  If you absolutely hate it, watch this movie anyway - I think it will change your mind.  This movie is essential for any DVD library.  Buy it.",5,"Vivid, Crisp, Brilliant",1055635200,"06 15, 2003",2003,2906,"['First', 'concessions', 'do', 'not', 'speak', 'Japanese', 'can', 'say', 'nothing', 'Japanese', 'language', 'version', 'quality', 'translation', 'Also', 'am', 'not', 'rabid', 'anime', 'fan', 'fact', 'was', 'first', 'japanese-animated', 'feature', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'Finally', 'movie', 'maturity', 'watch', 'appreciate', 'graphic', 'animated', 'violence', 'mature', 'themes', 'Now', 'review.This', 'animated', 'film', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'things', 'should', 'look', 'animation', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'Ran', 'directed', 'Kurosawa', 'favorite', 'film', 'Japan', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'story', 'was', 'terrific', 'using', 'developed', 'characters', 'tackling', 'real-world', 'problems', 'environmentalism', 'technology', 'tastefully', 'abundance', 'feel-good', 'Sierra-club', 'nonsense', 'la', 'Captain', 'Planet', 'Ferngully', 'humanity', 'relationship', 'nature', 'struggle', 'human', 'survival', 'difficulties', 'human', 'advancement', 'large', 'degree', 'sentimentalism', 'Randians', 'beware', 'story', 'should', 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'audiences.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'movie', 'art', 'art', 'direction', 'masterfully', 'done', 'entire', 'movie', 'feast', 'eyes', 'characters', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'drawn', 'fascinating', 'detail', 'rich', 'crisp', 'color', 'artistic', 'directorial', 'talent', 'utmost', 'respect', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'movie', 'believe', 'how', 'good', 'is.The', 'sound', 'well', 'done', 'wanting', 'utilize', 'overly', 'expensive', 'surround', 'sound', 'systems', ""'ll"", 'find', 'missing', 'out', 'sorry', 'sounds', 'are', 'crisp', 'though', 'complement', 'visual', 'experience', 'beautifully', 'music', 'chapter', 'complementing', 'other', 'senses', 'leading', 'emotions', 'whole', 'film.The', 'voice', 'talent', 'mixed', 'Americans', 'will', 'certainly', 'recognize', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'Smith', 'horrible', 'Minnie', 'Driver', 'excellent', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Thorton', 'so-so', 'Claire', 'Daines', 'excellent', 'fellow', 'reviewer', 'claims', 'poor', 'voice', 'actors', 'hurt', 'movie', 'repair', 'nonsense', 'dubbing', 'excellent', 'read', 'not', 'look', 'stupid', 'mismatched', 'Regarding', 'translation', 'see', 'concessions.This', 'movie', 'japanese', 'animation', 'animation', 'general', 'crispness', 'sound', 'enchantment', 'music', 'vividness', 'color', 'make', 'film', 'thrill', 'ride', 'senses', 'movie', 'problem', 'having', 'many', 'things', 'happening', 'once', 'clearly', 'what', 'happening', 'even', 'fast-paced', 'battle', 'scenes', 'sure', 'sign', 'directorial', 'experience', 'Praise', 'Hayao', 'Miyazaki', 'practically', 'neverending.If', 'enjoy', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'probably', 'already', 'own', 'film', 'absolutely', 'hate', 'watch', 'movie', 'anyway', 'think', 'will', 'change', 'mind', 'movie', 'essential', 'DVD', 'library', 'Buy']",Princess Mononoke
522199,A25JBPU5G0C29H,B00003CXBK,Zev Bazarov,"[0, 0]","This is epic story of man and nature. It shows the struggle of both man and nature to survive, and protect their kin. Nature and humanity have been at it for a while now, and they both have a strong hate for each other, blind of any sympathy or out look for a positive future with each other. This world changes suddenly when a wounded warrior travels west to find a cure, after he kills a possessed boar, and part of the demon slowly grows on him. This demon is fueled by hate. When he travels to the West and see this war going on, all he sees is hate. He says his goal is to &quot;see with eyes free of hate&quot;...only then will he be cured. What he does is befriends both the humans and animals, getting caught between them trying to help his new friends. It doesn't seem to work as they both push him out and tell him to stay away &quot;traitor&quot;. But when things turn to the worse, there he is to try to save both nature and man from ultimate destruction and teach the way of love. The ending is nothing short of amazing. This is an amazing tale that all should see (if you are old enough to see depiction's of battle and gore), that shows you how nothing good happens when you hate each other, and only want the other dead. And of course the animation is some of the best, in the field. Every scene has such minute detail and fluidity. The only negative spot its extras aren't great. But this is not a dvd you want to get for the extras, its the epic, story that sends a positive message to this world which is going through so many hardships. Its not just about man destroying nature, its more universal, about any two groups destroying each other. Put this on and watch a quality animation film, that's more than the everyday Saturday cartoons.",5,Quality story!
