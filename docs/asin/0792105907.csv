Mostly I like it because it has the right values. Wayne, Martin and their two brothers go through a rediscovery of what it is to be family, alongside the main stream of the story of deceit, greed and good finally (and at a cost) triumphing over evil. Wayne and Martin have great screen chemistry which was probably a mirror of their real life friendship. It is also fun seeing a young Dennis Hopper and an all black wearing bully - George Kennedy in a small screen stealing role, getting his a** kicked by Wayne!

Earl Holliman is Matt, and Michael Anderson, Jr., is Bud, the youngest. We never see Katie: the movie opens with her funeral. Getting off the train that John was expected to take was not John, but a hired killer. In fact, he was hired by the gunsmith who now owns the ranch the boys grew up on.John had stayed away because he is a gun fighter, and Katie didn't approve. Tom was a compulsive gambler, and cheated. He was also a con artist. There's a great scene where he raffles off his glass eye in a saloon, then buys it back. When the guy who won it and sold it back asks ""Aren't you going to put it back in?"" Tom raises his eye patch and reveals a perfectly good eye and says, ""Well, it would be pretty crowded in there, don't you think?""Matt runs a store somewhere a good distance away from Katie's place, but he had been to visit about three years earlier. But Bud says that was because he wanted to borrow money off her.Bud had been away at school, at his mother's insistence. So the brothers all decide Bud must go back to college and make something of himself, ""as a memorial to Katie."" But he wants to go with John and be a gun fighter, too.First, they need to settle up Katie's estate. That's when they discover that she had not sold the ranch they grew up in, but instead their father had been cheated out of it in a card game, and was shot in the back the same night. They figure maybe there's a connection. So they go to see the gunsmith who owns it now, a genuine SOB.That's just the beginning. The sheriff knows John isn't wanted for anything, and in fact is a very decent sort. But his deputy is a hot-headed youngster who seems to want to make a name for himself by bringing down John Elder, famous gun fighter. So the sheriff is stuck with trying to reign in his deputy and keep things cool until John leaves town.Then the sheriff is shot in the back in front of Katie's place, and things get seriously complicated.It's a good story, well told, and has enough plot twists to keep it from being ""just another western.""",3,Good Solid John Wayne Western,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",2012,2110,"['John', 'Wayne', 'John', 'Elder', 'oldest', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Tom', 'next', 'oldest', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'Matt', 'Michael', 'Anderson', 'Jr.', 'Bud', 'youngest', 'never', 'see', 'Katie', 'movie', 'funeral', 'Getting', 'off', 'train', 'John', 'was', 'expected', 'take', 'was', 'not', 'John', 'hired', 'killer', 'fact', 'was', 'hired', 'gunsmith', 'who', 'now', 'ranch', 'boys', 'grew', 'up', 'on.John', 'had', 'stayed', 'away', 'gun', 'fighter', 'Katie', 'did', ""n't"", 'approve', 'Tom', 'was', 'compulsive', 'gambler', 'cheated', 'was', 'also', 'con', 'artist', 'great', 'scene', 'where', 'glass', 'eye', 'saloon', 'then', 'back', 'When', 'guy', 'who', 'won', 'sold', 'back', 'Are', ""n't"", 'going', 'put', 'back', 'Tom', 'eye', 'patch', 'perfectly', 'good', 'eye', 'Well', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'crowded', 'there', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Matt', 'store', 'somewhere', 'good', 'distance', 'away', 'Katie', 'place', 'had', 'been', 'visit', 'three', 'years', 'earlier', 'Bud', 'was', 'wanted', 'borrow', 'money', 'her.Bud', 'had', 'been', 'away', 'school', 'mother', 'insistence', 'brothers', 'decide', 'Bud', 'must', 'go', 'back', 'college', 'make', 'something', 'memorial', 'Katie', 'go', 'John', 'be', 'gun', 'fighter', 'too.First', 'need', 'settle', 'up', 'Katie', 'estate', 'when', 'discover', 'had', 'not', 'sold', 'ranch', 'grew', 'up', 'instead', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'cheated', 'card', 'game', 'was', 'shot', 'back', 'same', 'night', 'figure', 'maybe', 'connection', 'go', 'see', 'gunsmith', 'who', 'now', 'genuine', 'SOB.That', 'just', 'beginning', 'sheriff', 'John', ""n't"", 'wanted', 'anything', 'fact', 'very', 'decent', 'sort', 'deputy', 'hot-headed', 'youngster', 'who', 'want', 'make', 'name', 'bringing', 'down', 'John', 'Elder', 'famous', 'gun', 'fighter', 'sheriff', 'stuck', 'trying', 'reign', 'deputy', 'keep', 'things', 'cool', 'John', 'town.Then', 'sheriff', 'shot', 'back', 'front', 'Katie', 'place', 'things', 'get', 'seriously', 'complicated.It', 'good', 'story', 'well', 'told', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'keep', 'being', 'just', 'western']",N/A
123112,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,0792105907,bixodoido,"[4, 7]","In this movie, John Wayne plays a character most of us who are familiar with his movies have seen before--a tough never-do-well man, too stubborn to stay out of trouble and too tender at heart to avoid ultimately doing the right thing.  Wayne plays John Elder, the eldest son of the deceased Katie Elder, for whose funeral John returns home.  Also returning are his three younger brothers: Tom (Dean Martin), Matt (Earl Holliman) , and Bud (Michael Anderson Jr.).The brothers are prevented from mourning their mother adequately by a scheming entrepreneur named Hastings, who swindled the Elders' parents out of their ranch.  It falls on the shoulders of the Elders to redress their mother's loss of the ranch, and try to earn enough money to force Bud to go back to college (that is what Katie wanted).The plot of this movie is interesting enough--it is distinctly typical of John Wayne and yet innovative enough to not be a cookie-cutter type story.  Most of the acting in the movie is poor, especially that of Hastings and his accomplice, Curly.  The bad acting (Wayne's is not the best of his career, but not bad, either) is offset, however, by the great performance of Dean Martin, who never fails to impress me in Western roles.  All in all, this is probably not a timeless Western classic, but it is good.

While he has a big reputation as a gunfighter, he spends the film avoiding fighting as much as he can.  Wayne also has fewer action sequences in the film.  This may simply be due to the plot of the movie, or it may have been his recover from lung cancer surgery and treatment that he had in 1964 and had delayed the shooting of the film until 1965.  Wayne insisted on doing all his own stunts even though it had only been four months since he had the cancerous lung removed.John Wayne, Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, and Michael Anderson Jr. play, respectively, John, Tom, Matt, and Bud Elder.  They have come back to Clearwater to attend their mother, Katie's funeral.  She was a widely loved, admired, hard working, tough, and sometimes sly woman (we are told she sold a man a blind horse once, and she also wrote a horse rancher that she would like a hundred or two hundred of his horses on credit to sell).  John's reputation is such that he watches the funeral from up on a hill.  His three brothers had waited for him at the train (along with Sheriff Billy and his hot headed deputy).  However, the only person that got off the train was a menacing looking stranger.  We later learn his name is Curly (WONDERFULLY played by George Kennedy) and he is a gunfighter who was hired by Morgan Hastings (James Gregory).As the brothers try to settle up Katie's estate they learn that there was something shady surrounding the loss or sale or transfer of Katie's 1,200 acre ranch to Morgan Hastings, who seems bent on buying up and building the town, with him owning it all.  They discover that their father had supposedly lost the ranch in a poker game, which seemed somewhat in character.  But his being shot very shortly after this game was supposed to have taken place raises their suspicions.  Sheriff Billy Wilson (Paul Fix) at first tries to simply get the brothers to move on, but he keeps getting closer to the truth of Bass Elder's death.  When Billy is shot, his hot headed deputy assumes it was the ""Elder Gang"" and arrests them without any investigation.  The movie heads towards its climax and a good one it is.Martha Hyer plays Martha Gordon who was an old friend of the family and took care of Katie.  She is as close to a romantic lead as the movie gets, and it doesn't get very close.  Percy Helton did a nice turn in a small role as a shopkeeper who enjoyed doing business with Katie Elder.  She bought at his store, but also made dresses for his wife and gave her a couple of guitar lessons.  Another interesting aspect of the film is that Wayne was really 57.  Katie's tombstone says she was 64.  So, how old John Elder was supposed to be (40?) is open to question.  Bud is supposed to be 17.  The old Western TV show Bonanza had a similar age problem with the oldest sons and Lorne Green.But this is a classic Waynestern.  Not one of the very best, but memorable and enjoyable.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI",5,"Not a great Waynestern, but a good one with very enjoyable twists",1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,2987,"['different', 'sort', 'Western', 'John', 'Wayne', 'big', 'reputation', 'gunfighter', 'film', 'avoiding', 'fighting', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'Wayne', 'also', 'fewer', 'action', 'sequences', 'film', 'may', 'simply', 'be', 'due', 'plot', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'recover', 'lung', 'cancer', 'surgery', 'treatment', 'had', '1964', 'had', 'delayed', 'shooting', 'film', '1965', 'Wayne', 'insisted', 'doing', 'own', 'stunts', 'even', 'had', 'only', 'been', 'four', 'months', 'had', 'cancerous', 'lung', 'removed.John', 'Wayne', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Earl', 'Holliman', 'Michael', 'Anderson', 'Jr.', 'play', 'respectively', 'John', 'Tom', 'Matt', 'Bud', 'Elder', 'have', 'come', 'back', 'Clearwater', 'attend', 'mother', 'Katie', 'funeral', 'was', 'widely', 'loved', 'admired', 'hard', 'working', 'tough', 'sometimes', 'sly', 'woman', 'are', 'told', 'sold', 'man', 'blind', 'horse', 'once', 'also', 'wrote', 'horse', 'rancher', 'would', 'like', 'hundred', 'two', 'hundred', 'horses', 'credit', 'sell', 'John', 'reputation', 'such', 'funeral', 'hill', 'three', 'brothers', 'had', 'waited', 'train', 'Sheriff', 'Billy', 'hot', 'headed', 'deputy', 'However', 'only', 'person', 'got', 'train', 'was', 'menacing', 'looking', 'stranger', 'later', 'learn', 'name', 'Curly', 'WONDERFULLY', 'played', 'George', 'Kennedy', 'gunfighter', 'who', 'was', 'hired', 'Morgan', 'Hastings', 'James', 'Gregory', '.As', 'brothers', 'try', 'settle', 'up', 'Katie', 'estate', 'learn', 'was', 'something', 'shady', 'surrounding', 'loss', 'sale', 'transfer', 'Katie', '1,200', 'acre', 'ranch', 'Morgan', 'Hastings', 'who', 'bent', 'buying', 'up', 'building', 'town', 'owning', 'discover', 'father', 'had', 'supposedly', 'lost', 'ranch', 'poker', 'game', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'character', 'being', 'shot', 'very', 'shortly', 'game', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'taken', 'place', 'suspicions', 'Sheriff', 'Billy', 'Wilson', 'Paul', 'Fix', 'first', 'tries', 'simply', 'get', 'brothers', 'move', 'getting', 'closer', 'truth', 'Bass', 'Elder', 'death', 'When', 'Billy', 'shot', 'hot', 'headed', 'deputy', 'was', 'Elder', 'Gang', 'investigation', 'movie', 'climax', 'good', 'one', 'Hyer', 'Martha', 'Gordon', 'who', 'was', 'old', 'friend', 'family', 'took', 'care', 'Katie', 'as', 'close', 'romantic', 'lead', 'movie', ""n't"", 'get', 'very', 'close', 'Percy', 'Helton', 'did', 'nice', 'turn', 'small', 'role', 'shopkeeper', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'business', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'bought', 'store', 'also', 'made', 'dresses', 'wife', 'gave', 'couple', 'guitar', 'lessons', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'Wayne', 'was', 'really', '57', 'Katie', 'tombstone', 'was', '64', 'So', 'how', 'old', 'John', 'Elder', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', '40', 'open', 'question', 'Bud', 'supposed', 'be', '17', 'old', 'Western', 'TV', 'show', 'Bonanza', 'had', 'similar', 'age', 'problem', 'oldest', 'sons', 'Lorne', 'Green.But', 'classic', 'Waynestern', 'Not', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'memorable', 'enjoyable.Reviewed', 'Craig', 'Matteson', 'Ann', 'Arbor', 'MI']",N/A

And we're supposed to believe the Duke is their big bro?  That's why I chuckle every time I come across THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER on one of the cable channels.  Wayne, playing eldest Elder son John (the gunfighter, of course), is about as believable an older sibling to Holliman, Anderson, and Dean Martin (playing second son Tom, the gambler, of course) as Lorne Greene was as papa to his Bonanza offspring.  It's a nutty distraction, yet still for Duke fans THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER delivers a good ol' fashioned shoot-'em-up Western.As the four Elder sons reunite for the first time in years for their mother's funeral they sense something is awry in Katie's dusty Texas town.  Their mother died penniless, while their father, Bass (great name), allegedly lost the Elder Ranch in a card game.  Naturally--and against the express wishes of the town sheriff (venerable character actor Paul Fix)--the brothers do some investigating, only to be framed for murder, then ultimately (and predictably) face a showdown with entrepreneur Morgan Hastings (James Gregory), the villain who stole their parents' ranch.  Dennis Hopper and George Kennedy stand out from the rest of the supporting cast (they always do), the ending (in keeping with the Duke tradition) is over the top, and THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER makes its mark as one of Wayne's most memorable films.

123134,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,0792105907,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 4]","""The Sons of Katie Elder"" is a great film. Maybe not at the same exhalted level as ""The Searchers"" or ""The Man Who Killed Liberty Valance"", but clearly far superior to most westerns. The 1965 film stars John Wayne and Dean Martin, with Earl Holliman, James Gregory, Paul Fix, George Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, and Martha Hyer. The film was directed by Henry Hathaway, a director who specialized in westerns from his earliest films - ""Heritage of the Desert"" (1932), ""Wild Horse Mesa"" (1932) - to his later films - ""Shootout"" (1971), ""5 Card Stud"" (1968), yet curiously enough his only nomination for an Oscar was for ""Lives of a Bengal Lancer"" (1935), and his best known films are non-Westerns (e.g., ""Of Human Bondage"", ""Call Northside 777"", ""The Desert Fox""). He once said ""To be a good director you've got to be a bastard. I'm a bastard and I know it.""John Wayne was a bankable  box office draw at the time, having appeared in such western  hits as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""3 Godfathers"" (1948),  ""Fort Apache"" (1948), ""Red River"" (1948), ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949, ""Rio Bravo"" (1959), and ""The Alamo"" (1960) . Wayne was nominated for Best Actor for ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) and when he worked with director Henry Hathaway again, he would finally earn an Oscar for ""True Grit"" (1969). This is the first film made by Wayne after he recovered from lung surgery to remove cancer. He shows little wear as a result of the experience.Viewers may notice that Wayne appears a little too old for this part. In fact he was 57 when it was filmed, and according to Katie Elder's tombstone, she was 64 when she died. Hence, Wayne was born when she was 7 year old. Also, the difference in age between Wayne and the youngest son is 36 years.Dean Martin and Wayne worked together in ""Rio Bravo"" in 1959. In 1960 he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his work in ""Who Was That Lady"" and also made ""Ocean's Eleven"" which he followed with ""Sergeants 3"" (1962) and ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" (1964). So by the time ""Sons of Katie Elder"" was made, Martin was a formidable star, and in fact, 1965 was the year he started ""The Dean Martin Show"" (1965-74) that went on to earn 13 Emmy nominations and 4 Golden Globe nominations along with a win in 1967 for Dean.Earl Holliman won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor in 1957 (""The Rainmaker"") and was nominated in 1992 for the TV series ""Delta"". He started in 1953 with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in ""Scared Stiff"" but he is probably best known for his co-starring role with Angie Dickinson in TVs ""Police Woman"" (1974-8). He specialized in westerns and appeared in ""Gunfight at OK Corral"" (1957), ""Last Train from Gun Hill"" (1959), ""Gunsmoke: Return to Dodge"" (1987) and had a recurring role in the TV series ""The Wide Country"" (1962-3). Holliman plays one of the sons.James Gregory appeared in nearly 100 films and as many TV programs. He's best remembered for his role as the Senator in ""Manchurian Candidate"" (1962) and Commander Ritchie in ""PT 109"" (1963) and  recurring roles as Ulysses S. Grant in the TV series ""Wild Wild West"" (1965-9) and Inspector Frank Luger in ""Barney Miller"" (1975-82). Gregory plays the man who killed Bass Elder and stole his farm from Katie.Dennis Hopper plays Gregory's milk toast son. Hopper  is an American icon. Twice nominated for an Oscar (""Hoosiers"" and ""Easy Rider""), he is as well known for his excellent acting (e.g., ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Out of the Blue"", ""Blue Velvet"") as for his bombs (e.g., ""Waterworld"", ""Speed""). My favorite Dennis Hopper role was as Clifford Worley in ""True Romance"" (1993) opposite Christopher  Walken.Paul Fix plays the Marshall. Fix played in more than 200 films, many of them westerns, starting in the silent film era. He gave us such memorable roles as old man Maxwell in ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"" (1973), and Joan Crawford's confidant Eddie in ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954). He played with Wayne in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (1949), ""The Fighting Kentuckian"" (1949), ""Big Jim McLain"" (1952), ""Hondo"" (1953)"" and El Dorado"" (1967). He's best remembered for his role as the Marshall in Sam Peckinpah's TV series ""The Rifleman"" (1958-65).George Kennedy plays the evil gunfighter hired by Gregory to kill Wayne. Kennedy is best remembered for his role as the convict who beats up Paul Newman in ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) for which he won the Oscar. He could play a good guy (e.g., Major Armbuster in ""Dirty Dozen"", Chris in ""Guns of the Magnificent Seven"", Patton in ""Brass Target"") and a villain (e.g., Red in ""Thunbderbolt and Lightfoot"", Ben Bowman in ""The Eiger Sanction"") and was also adept at comedy (e.g., ""Airport 1975"", ""The Naked Gun"").Martha Hyer  was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Some Came Running"" (1958) in which she appeared with Dean Martin. She appeared with Jerry without Dean in ""The Delicate Delinquent"" (1956). She has more than 100 films to her credit. She plays a friend of the late Katie Elder, and has the type of loveless relationship that Wayne had in many of his films (e.g., ""The Horse Soldiers"" with Constance Bennett, ""The Alamo"" with Linda Darnell).In addition to this powerful cast, Wayne used several actors who had worked with him in the past, including John Qualen, Strother Martin, tough guy John Doucette, and Rhys Williams.- John Doucette's chubby face and heavy set frame are familiar to everyone from his 200+ films, usually as a heavy. He was distinguished by his husky voice and being the fastest draw in Hollywood. He was equally at home in film and on TV and was comfortable in Westerns as well as biblical epics. He plays the blacksmith, but uncharacteristically  he isn't one of the bad guys in this film.- Rhys Williams plump body and high pitched voice contributed to over 100 films from ""How Green was My Valley"" (1941) to ""Skullduggery"" (1970). He often appeared in westerns (e.g., ""Johhny Guitar"", ""The Fastest Gun Alive"", ""The Kentuckian"") and had a recurring role in Sam Peckinpah's ""The Rifleman"" as Doc Burrage.- Strother Martin was a terrific character actor, known for his physicality and strange mannerisms. John Ford used him in ""Two Rode Together"", ""The Deadly Companions"" (1961), and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962). Wayne used him in ""Rooster Cogburn"" (1975), ""True Grit"" (1969), ""McLintock"" (1963), and ""The Horse Soldiers"" (1959). He's best remembered as the Captain in ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967) but I remember him best for his role as one of the bounty hunters in Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969).- John Qualen was part of the Wayne/Ford stock company. He made nearly 200 films, 9 of them directed by  John Ford and 3 with Wayne but not Ford - ""The High and the Mighty"" (1954), and ""North to Alaska (1960) directed by Hathaway, ""Donovan's Reef"" (1963). My favorite John Qualen role was as Lars in ""The Searchers"" (1956).Lucien Ballard does the camera work and Elmer Bernstein does the music. Ballard was one of the greatest cinematographers. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""The Caretakers"" (1963) and won a NSFC Award for ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He lensed more than 100 films, including such notables as ""The Desert Rats"" (1953) with Hathaway directing, and ""True Grit"" with Wayne and Hathaway, He was a favorite of Sam Peckinpah who used him in several of his films -  ""Ride the High Country"" (1962), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), ""The Getaway"" (1972), ""The Ballad of Cable Hogue""(1970), and ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). Ballard's work in this film is truly exceptional. It rivals some of the best work of John Ford.Elmer Bernstein was nominated for an Oscar 14 times and won once (""Thoroughly Modern Millie"" in 1967). He was nominated twice for an Emmy and won once (""The Making of the President"" in 1963), and was nominated 7 times for a Golden Globe and won twice (""To Kill a Mockingbird"" in 1962 and ""Hawaii"" in 1967. To top it off he was twice nominated for a Grammy (but never won). Bernstein's score is terrific.The film has many memorable scenes - John Wayne's first appearance against the rock monuments, Wayne's clubbing Kennedy in the face, Dean Martin auctioning off his fake eye, the scene under the bridge when one of the brothers is killed, and Katie's rocking chair seeming to have a life of its own. If there is any weakness, it is the ultimate faceoff between Wayne and Kennedy.",4,Great Western,1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,8305,"['Sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'great', 'film', 'Maybe', 'not', 'same',

The four adult sons of Katie Elder - with a rather improbable total age spread of nearly 40 years (this is only one of the many improbabilities of this film) - reunite in their hometown of Clearwater, Texas, in 1898 for their mother's funeral: John Wayne an (in)famous professional gunman, Dean Martin a professional gambler also good with the gun, Earl Holliman a a non-descript rancher, and Michael Anderson Jr as kid brother.Katie Elder was obviously very much liked by the community, where all were aware of her honesty, her poverty and her undying love for the sons who neglected her. The brothers now want to do something for Katie's sake, and their plan is to send the kid brother to college (an improbable proposal), raising money through the sale of another man's herd of horses (see above). The way their father Bass Elder supposedly lost his ranch to local gunsmith James Gregory and was afterwards shot in the back, killer still unknown, sounds highly improbable to the four (as it does to anybody else).Gregory barely hides his hostile attitude towards the brothers and brings in George Kennedy as a hired gun. Slowly enough for the Elders to suspect multiple foul play: As it turns out, Hastings had indeed claimed the Elder ranch by murdering Bass Elder. When Hastings learns about the brothers' investigations, he frames them for murder of sheriff Paul Fix, and, not content with seeing them going to prison, arranges an ambush in which Holliman is killed and Anderson seriously injured. Wayne and Martin take it upon themselves to avenge the family by going after Hastings - Wayne gets him in the end by - most appropriately, this time - blowing him up in his own store.The film, so the producers claim, is roughly based on the 1888 true story of the five Marlow Brothers (George, Boone, Alfred, Lewellyn and Charles) of Graham, Texas, in Young County, and Marlow, Oklahoma. Probably, or probably not - in the course of the movie, you soon give up that the plot is really likely, probable or even real, as your IQ quickly converges to that of the protagonists.

She was going to see Bud through college or die....well..she died.""Those quiet reflecting words were spoken by Martha Hyer, to the four brothers, to help try and get them to understand who their mother was and what her desires were.  This is a very much under-rated movie.  From the opening credits as the train pulls through the river gorge into town, with Elmer Bernstein's great musical score playing in the back, this is a good movie.  It is about four brothers coming back to town from being away from their home for years.  They are back to attend the funeral of their mother, Katie Elder, whom they really never knew.We learn about Katie from the towns people who attend the funeral.  From the mother who named her baby 'Katie' after their mother,the preacher, the rancher she traded the blind horse, the banker, the merchant and the undertaker.  All these knew Katie better than her sons.  She seems to have confided alot with Mary, Martha Hyer, and had her look in on her sons.We learn about her sons, John the gunfigher..who attended the funeral from a distance, Tom the gambler..who always wants to bet, Matt the hardware man..who is really only there out of duty, and Bud the youngest..college man but doesn't want to stay or go to college...he wants to follow his exciting brothers.We also learn that the ranch they thought they would inherit wasn't Katie's anymore..the banker let her stay out at the Lupin place.  ""Morgan Hasting owns the place"", Sheriff Billy Wilson tells John.  As the movie moves on we find out more about how Hasting, James Gregory, and his son, a young Dennis Hopper, got the ranch.  We learn why he hired a gunman, George Kennedy, to watch to see if John shows up.Soon the brothers are framed for murder and must make their stand and prove their innocence.  With Hastings out to keep them from the truth, the movie moves down to the familar showdown shootout.This movie isn't filmed or driven at the John Ford pace but it doesn't have to.  This is a good solid well put together film by Henry Hathaway.

123142,A2HVL790PBWYTU,0792105907,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER have returned to Clearwater, Texas to pay last respects to their sainted mother at her funeral. The four estranged brothers are devastated to learn that, in their years of absence, their alcoholic father died under mysterious circumstances, their mother rendered destitute, and the family ranch ceded over to a heartless aspiring land baron. Katie's boys, sniffing something rotten, decide to tarry in Clearwater and ask certain uncomfortable questions.The late Katie Elder was beloved by everyone and her presence lingers palpably throughout the picture, and so John, Tom, Matt, and Bud come to face the rancor and scorn of the townspeople. Everyone condemns them for having abandoned their mother in her direst time of need. It's a poor homecoming. Further obstacles surface in the shape of the menacing gunslinger (George Kennedy) privately contracted by the Elder ranch's concerned new owner, and there's also the ongoing harassment by the very pushy sheriff's deputy. When things go sideways, the blame readily shifts to the Elder brothers. And, wait, is that a lynch mob over there?Seasoned director Henry Hathaway helms an old school western that has its share of rousing moments but also dabbles in introspection. This is the second time John Wayne and Dean Martin would work together (after their glorious RIO BRAVO), and they're still sympatico, Deano roguishly taking on his trademark gambler/hustler character and the Duke playing the surly eldest brother and infamous gunfighter. Wayne, then 58-years-old, returned to the silver screen after his cancer operation, not that you'd know it. John Wayne looms tall and rugged and resolute as ever. Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson, Jr. round out the remaining Elder brothers, and it ain't their fault their light don't glow near as bright as Wayne and Deano's.The key performers get a lot of elbow room to play in, what with the Elder brothers being such a boisterous, bickering, brawling bunch, and much of the brawny humor comes from their interactions amongst each other. It's almost like SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, except that people pump lead into each other and there's no barn-raising dance-off. A young Dennis Hopper chews up the scenery some. Martha Hyer serves as the chaste eye candy. And main villain James Gregory does well with his three-dimensional role. His larcenous land grabber starts out even-keeled but progressively takes more and more of a heel turn as the story progresses.There's a contemplative, bittersweet tone in this film. You can sense the Elder boys' regret in their neglect of their mother. And how damning to learn that during their absent years, Katie Elder had lied for them, had told the world how regularly her sons sent her money, even though the two eldest sons (Wayne and Martin's characters) were roaming the West wanted by the law. The pace could have picked up some. There could have been more action, instead of most of it being relegated to the final act. But John Wayne is still John Wayne, indomitable.

The four sons of Katie Elder, who had not seen each other, or her, in years, come to her funeral. The eldest brother, John Elder (John Wayne), watches the funeral from a distance.Why are some of the townspeople anxious for John Elder, a gunslinger, to leave the town as soon as possible after the funeral? The brothers do not get straight answers as to how it was that their mother had recently lost her property, and begin to smell a rat. They also learn that their father had been murdered, but no one will say who was responsible.A woman who was a close friend of Katie Elder describes Mrs. Elder as a devout woman of character, and how disappointed she was in her four sons.  At least some of Katie Elder's sons mailed her letters and money, but had otherwise gone down the wrong paths in life. Mrs. Elder at least wanted one of them to go to college, but he balked. The woman did not want to discuss the murder of Mr. Elder because Katie Elder didn't want vengeance and further violence.Three of the brothers wanted to fulfill their mother's wishes that the remaining one go to college, but he continues to balk. John Elder keeps the pressure on.Sibling rivalry exists even in adulthood. At one time, all four brothers are involved in a brawl. At another time, they drag each other into a body of water.The conspiracy of silence about Mrs. Elder's property and her murdered husband begins to unravel despite the current owners' persistent efforts to have it stifled. In time, the current owners of Mrs. Elder's property frame the four sons for murder. The local law enforcement officials seem ready to believe the charge with no evidence, and a lynch mob surrounds the prison. There is a massive shootout, and three of the four brothers are wounded. Will any of these three survive? Will they be able to clear the Elder name of the murder charge?",5,"Four Wild Sons of a Murdered Father and a Devout, Defrauded Mother",1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1948,"['setting', 'western', 'town', 'Clearwater', 'TX', 'Laredo', 'probably', '1870', 'four', 'sons', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'years', 'come', 'funeral', 'eldest', 'brother', 'John', 'Elder', 'John', 'Wayne', 'funeral', 'distance.Why', 'are', 'townspeople', 'anxious', 'John', 'Elder', 'gunslinger', 'leave', 'town', 'as', 'soon', 'possible', 'funeral', 'brothers', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'straight', 'answers', 'how', 'was', 'mother', 'had', 'recently', 'lost', 'property', 'begin', 'smell', 'rat', 'also', 'learn', 'father', 'had', 'been', 'murdered', 'one', 'will', 'say', 'who', 'was', 'responsible.A', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'close', 'friend', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'Mrs.', 'Elder', 'devout', 'woman', 'character', 'how', 'disappointed', 'was', 'four', 'sons', 'least', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'sons', 'mailed', 'letters', 'money', 'had', 'otherwise', 'gone', 'down', 'wrong', 'paths', 'life', 'Mrs.', 'Elder', 'least', 'wanted', 'one', 'go', 'college', 'balked', 'woman', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'discuss', 'murder', 'Mr.', 'Elder', 'Katie', 'Elder', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'vengeance', 'further', 'violence.Three', 'brothers', 'wanted', 'fulfill', 'mother', 'wishes', 'remaining', 'one', 'go', 'college', 'balk', 'John', 'Elder', 'pressure', 'on.Sibling', 'rivalry', 'exists', 'even', 'adulthood', 'one', 'time', 'four', 'brothers', 'are', 'involved', 'brawl', 'time', 'drag', 'other', 'body', 'water.The', 'conspiracy', 'silence', 'Mrs.', 'Elder', 'property', 'murdered', 'husband', 'unravel', 'current', 'owners', 'persistent', 'efforts', 'have', 'stifled', 'time', 'current', 'owners', 'Mrs.', 'Elder', 'property', 'frame', 'four', 'sons', 'murder', 'local', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'seem', 'ready', 'believe', 'charge', 'evidence', 'lynch', 'mob', 'prison', 'massive', 'shootout', 'three', 'four', 'brothers', 'are', 'wounded', 'Will', 'three', 'survive', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'clear', 'Elder', 'name', 'murder', 'charge']",N/A

After a very short recovery stint, Wayne filmed ""Sons of Katie Elder"" in the winter of 64-65.  According to many sources, Wayne had a very hard shoot, short of breath and residual pain from the surgery making each day a challenge.  He wanted to show his movie fans that he had ""licked the Big C"" as he called it.  Watching Wayne in ""Sons"", one would never imagine the physical difficulties he faced; he is as physical as ever in this action-packed western where he and his brothers fight to get back their dead father's ranch from the man who stole it.With costars Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, and Michael Anderson Jr., Wayne, as the older brother John Elder, leads his brothers in the battle to recover their ranch and avenge the murder of their father.  James Gregory plays the evil and conniving Morgan Hastings, the man who stole the ranch, and his hired killer is the brawny George Kennedy.  Against impossible odds, the Elder boys find themselves in a gunfight to the death trapped beneath a bridge.  Here they make their heroic last stand in an epic gun battle.The strong supporting cast make this film work.  Dean Martin is exceptionally good as Tom Elder.  Paul Fix, a standard in many Wayne films, plays the sheriff, and Martha Hyer plays the female lead (a very small but important part).The plot moves right along, and there is plenty of action that makes this film an entertaining 2 hours.Wayne went on to film many more westerns, including True Grit (1969), in which he won his only Oscar. He would die of stomach cancer in 1979 in California UCLA Hospital.

It takes place in the late 1800s and is very loosely based on the prominent Marlowe family of the Texas/Oklahoma border area. As in Rio Bravo, Duke teams up well w/Dean Martin, who plays the second oldest of the four sons of Katie Elder. The third son is Earl Holliman, who does well too; the only weak link in the acting department is Michael Anderson, Jr., who plays the youngest son. Outside the Elder family, there's some fine acting by James Gregory, who plays the nemesis of the Elders, Morgan Hastings; Dennis Hopper, who plays Morgans son, and George Kennedy, who plays a hired gunslinger. There are also a number of other fine character actors you will likely recognize from Westerns and other films of the 50s & 60s.

Following their mother's death, the four Elder boys, John, the gunslinger, Tom, the gambler, Matt, the businessman, and Bud, the youngest, return home to Clearwater, Texas for her funeral.  In hopes of setting things right, the Elders try to leave a memorial for their mother by clearing their name, but right away things go awry.  Their father Bass was killed under suspicious circumstances and lost the family ranch in a card game so can the Elders figure out what happened all while leaving something to make their deceased mother proud?  When it comes to John Wayne westerns, this one is a notch above the others.  It's a good old-fashioned western with the good guys vs. the bad guys.  There's some great locations in Durango, including the Mexican village from Major Dundee, and Elmer Bernstein turns in a lively western score that you'll be humming for days afterward.  John Wayne fans and western fans alike will not be disappointed with this one.Playing the oldest of the Elder brothers, John Wayne stars as John Elder, the gunslinger who sees his brothers for the first time in years at his mother's funeral.  It's John who leads the effort to make a name for the family in honor of their much-beloved mother.  Dean Martin plays Tom, the second oldest brother who's quick with cards and a gun.  Wayne and Martin are great here together, just like in Rio Bravo.  Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson JR are the other two brothers, Matt and Bud, who doesn't want to go back to college even at his brothers' encouragement. The chemistry among the four brothers is very believable and makes the movie more fun to watch because of their interactions.  Paul Fix and Jermey Slate are very good as Sheriff Billy Wilson, the experienced and somewhat world weary peace officer, and Ben Latta, his trigger happy deputy.  James Gregory is solid as slimy Morgan Hastings, a local rancher/businessman trying to make something of Clearwater.  Martha Hyer is good as Mary Gordon, a woman who was a close friend of Katie.  The more than solid supporting cast also includes George Kennedy as Curley, a gunslinger hired by Hastings, Dennis Hopper, John Doucette, John Qualen, and Strother Martin.The DVD is a really good purchase with the widescreen presentation included here.  You'd never know the movie is over 45 years old.  The only special feature here is a theatrical trailer.

Heck, he was even Joseph Stalin's favourite actor. However, Stalin considered having him assassinated because Wayne represented the heart of American patriotism. Not many actors can claim that kind of stature. The Sons of Katie Elder is just a good movie from the days when westerns were the worlds favorite movies. Taken as a movie actor and nothing else, Wayne had an immensely likeable on screen persona. He was in 172 movies. In many years, he was the number one box office actor. In the 60s there was an entire black propaganda campaign run against him by communism to destroy his patriotic image. He was seen as a threat to communism for representing honest values which communism had to eradicate in order to dominate. What other actor can claim that. None.
