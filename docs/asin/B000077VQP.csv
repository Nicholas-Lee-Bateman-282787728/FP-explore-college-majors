Yes, it did have some problems in the story line about what a group of people would normally do but other than that, it is a great story. True, it doesn't have all the gore that the other horror films have, but it doesn't need it either.

724689,A2FVE6V3YTFIDO,B000077VQP,"Amazon Customer ""Glen""","[19, 20]","The thing that amazed me most about this DVD is that the film was a made for TV thriller starring Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey (best known for their performances on L.A. Law) and although the plot may seem contrived to some viewers, I found it to be chilling, entertaining and well acted. Some viewers, I understand, were confused and unhappy with the conclusion (which I will not give away) but I believe the director's idea was to put you into this family's struggle and see it from their viewpoint, so maybe it's fair to say, all  questions should not be answered. In the tradition of the older, thinking-man's films, this movie leaves much room for discussion, which is sadly missing from a lot of today's supernatural thrillers where people always want set answers and happy endings. If you want this in this movie, then don't bother. If you are looking for something that is entertaining and leaves room for debate , this is YOUR type of thriller. Plot wise, all I'll say in synopsis is: Harry Hamlin plays a father of two whom has lost his wife five years previously. In an attempt to help with a bonding relationship with his children and his new wife (Dey) they embark on a vacation out west. Hamlin's son, an avid photographer has an interest in stopping in a ""Ghost town"" of Weaver to shoot some photos. But no one in the neighboring town of Stepford people claim to have never heard of the town.Well, they find Weaver ...or does Weaver find them?Some critics may shun this movie for it's Stephen King/Twilight Zone overtones. There are many to be found here, throw in a sprinkle of Blair Witch for good measure. Harry Hamlin is great as the protective father and Susan Dey, sadly missing from today's films is a great highly underrated actress and does well as the protective stepmom whose expectations of bonding with her two new stepchildren are taken to a much higher level. You may remember Dey as Laurie Partridge from ABC's Partridge Family or as the tough but sexy DA Grace Van Owen from L.A. Law.Overall, I thought the movie had many chilling moments and suspense which will undoubtably earn it cult status if even only for it's ""Partridge Family"", ""LA Law"" and ""7th Heaven"" alumni. In the tradition of Stephen King, Twilight Zone and Night Gallery, this movie scores!

His character took charge in certain scenes. The photography and sets were good, very authentic and believable.The unseen, unknown &quot;stalkers&quot; were a part of the problem.  They are never seen and we are asked to believe that they might be a cloud of dust.  They breathe heavy and are apparently color blind, or perhaps possess a built in night vision.Lastly, the movie ends terribly.  We're all so used to a happy ending that this one really disappoints.

Government experiments gone haywire?  Aliens?  What's with the spooky cloud of dust?  What's with the asthmatic off screen presence?  Why are all the people seemingly being mind controlled?  Or are they dead?  What DID happen to Ethan when he is lost in the desert?  Do we get answers to these questions?  No, no siree!

Let me put it simply: ever heard the phrase ""the thing we fear the most is the unknown""? It isn't a flaw in the movie that you never see the monster. It is a psychological aspect designed to make you think. Classic horror movies used to have actual suspense in them. Audiences nowadays have become so used to silly template horror flicks that spoon-feed them every piece of information that when one finally comes along that is brave enough to go back to the older - and better - Hitchcockian style of horror/thriller, the audience can't grasp the subtleties.

In other words, no matter how weird or seemingly impossible a situtation may be (and I can accept everything this movie implied), the consequences should not be ignored.Example: 20-some families have disappeared in the same area over a period of years. Wouldn't that have drawn LOTS of attention? And wouldn't searchers recognize the missing people who had been &quot;converted&quot; (or whatever.)Most of the residents acted almost zombi-like. But the sheriff could easily pass for &quot;normal&quot; (even though he obviously was not.)I could give many other examples. The best movies are those that make one think.
