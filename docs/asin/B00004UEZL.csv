552549,AUZ460FTPQRNQ,B00004UEZL,"ladycplum ""Severe Rickmaniac""","[3, 3]","Alan Rickman continues to amaze me with the diversity and depth he brings to every role he plays. His Rasputin just leapt out at you, even in moments when he was being serious & contemplative. He so richly deserved all the accolades that were awarded to him for his performance. He played so many facets, there were times you wanted to strangle him, and other times when you felt completely sympathetic to him, and wondered if he truly was a Holy Man who just became a pawn in the power struggle of the time. I also have to give kudos to both Greta Scacchi & Ian McKellen for their performances as the doomed Tsar & Tsarina, bursting with hope and happiness as Alexei is ""cured"", and falling into the pit of despair as their world crumbles around them. An amazing movie, period.",5,Stunning...,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,778,"['Alan', 'Rickman', 'amaze', 'diversity', 'depth', 'role', 'Rasputin', 'just', 'leapt', 'out', 'even', 'moments', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'serious', 'contemplative', 'so', 'richly', 'deserved', 'accolades', 'were', 'awarded', 'performance', 'played', 'so', 'many', 'facets', 'were', 'times', 'wanted', 'strangle', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'felt', 'completely', 'sympathetic', 'wondered', 'truly', 'was', 'Holy', 'Man', 'who', 'just', 'became', 'pawn', 'power', 'struggle', 'time', 'also', 'have', 'give', 'kudos', 'Greta', 'Scacchi', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'performances', 'doomed', 'Tsar', 'Tsarina', 'bursting', 'hope', 'happiness', 'Alexei', 'cured', 'falling', 'pit', 'despair', 'world', 'amazing', 'movie', 'period']",N/A

The entire cast and production are the best, and Rickman's performance here has given me a sense of authenticity to everything else he does.

Yes, it is based on fact, but I am sure than no movie can really accurately described what really went on in the lives of the Romanovs. However, as a movie, its really brilliant. Its utterly mesmerizing, and it really is all thanks to Alan Rickman. He is utter perfection in this. His portrayal of the infamous Rasputin is genius and almost creepy. The likeness is undeniable. This is a dramatic film and I really wish a proper dvd would finally come out.",5,Alan Rickman is Rasputin!,1202342400,"02 7, 2008",2008,492,"['beautifully', 'depicted', 'film', 'Yes', 'based', 'fact', 'am', 'sure', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'accurately', 'described', 'what', 'really', 'went', 'lives', 'Romanovs', 'However', 'movie', 'really', 'brilliant', 'utterly', 'mesmerizing', 'really', 'thanks', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'utter', 'perfection', 'portrayal', 'infamous', 'Rasputin', 'genius', 'almost', 'creepy', 'likeness', 'undeniable', 'dramatic', 'film', 'really', 'wish', 'proper', 'dvd', 'would', 'finally', 'come', 'out']",N/A
