This is the cable tv special that was aired over 3 nights, which is why I can offer an opinion before it's release.This is an excellent dvd. It's a documentary about Taylor's extraordinary musical journey from early home movies to the great live & backstage footage of her Fearless Tour. My highest recommendation for this dvd. This is the one to get. I've enjoyed it several times on a dvd-r that I burnt from the HUB cable channel, but I'm replacing it with this factory dvd which will not have the station logo in the right hand corner and will look even better than what I copied off cable. I can't say enough about how much fun this dvd is. Great sound and picture quality! No question--5 stars and worth every penny!!I just noticed the listing that this is released by Shout Factory. I have bought cds and dvds released by Shout Factory and have always been impressed by the quality of their products.

It contains all three episodes which aired on the Hub. It consist of interviews with Taylor herself, along with all those who were involved in the Fearless Tour and shows snippets of performance taken from the tour. The documentary gives you an in depth report on Taylor's life from her as a child to going to Nashville when she was 11 onto signing her record deal with Scott Borchetta, president and owner of Big Machine Records, onward to even a small snippet about Speak Now. You also get a behind the scenes look at how Taylor designed for the tour as well as behind the scenes stuff you'd originally would've known had you gone to her shows. Including about the T-Party and Mamma Swift's Backstage tour. Thirteen performances are included on the DVD all thirteen are seen in snippets throughout the Journey to Fearless documentary.This is just amazing and as a Taylor Swift fan I am proud to own this. It isn't a disappointment and it's worth your money so be sure to get your copy. Taylor is just amazing! 5 stars!",5,Absolutely Amazing.,1318291200,"10 11, 2011",2011,1112,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'watched', 'TV', 'did', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'three', 'episodes', 'aired', 'Hub', 'consist', 'interviews', 'Taylor', 'who', 'were', 'involved', 'Fearless', 'Tour', 'snippets', 'performance', 'taken', 'tour', 'documentary', 'depth', 'report', 'Taylor', 'life', 'child', 'going', 'Nashville', 'when', 'was', '11', 'signing', 'record', 'deal', 'Scott', 'Borchetta', 'president', 'owner', 'Big', 'Machine', 'Records', 'onward', 'even', 'small', 'snippet', 'Speak', 'Now', 'also', 'get', 'scenes', 'look', 'how', 'Taylor', 'designed', 'tour', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'stuff', ""'d"", 'originally', 'would', ""'ve"", 'known', 'had', 'gone', 'shows', 'Including', 'T-Party', 'Mamma', 'Swift', 'Backstage', 'tour', 'Thirteen', 'performances', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'thirteen', 'are', 'seen', 'snippets', 'Journey', 'Fearless', 'documentary.This', 'just', 'amazing', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'fan', 'am', 'proud', 'own', ""n't"", 'disappointment', 'money', 'so', 'be', 'sure', 'get', 'copy', 'Taylor', 'just', 'amazing', '5', 'stars']",N/A
