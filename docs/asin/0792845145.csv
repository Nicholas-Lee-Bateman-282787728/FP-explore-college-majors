152556,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792845145,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","Salvador, 1986 filmThe story begins with news photographs. People are demonstrating in the streets, some bodies are on the ground. [This is based on the events in the late 1970s.] Richard Boyle wants to cover these events as a freelance journalist. He is arrested for traffic offences, then released. His friend Doc lost his dog. Richie&#8217;s girlfriend left him. So they drive to El Salvador to cover the conflict there. They are stopped at a road block, then taken into town. One young man with glasses is a suspect. They are taken to a military post. Colonel Figueroa welcomes them. Richie travels to see old friends. He meets another young journalist and they discuss work. Is there work for Richie? They photograph bodies left in the countryside. They visit the town square where people are gathered. Richie looks for a job. Survivors from a massacre get medical care from volunteers.Richie is offered a job in providing information. He meets other journalists. [His conversation makes him a sort of a jerk.] A military man plans to take revenge on some religious people. &#8220;You will be famous.&#8221; Richie asks for another load from a man. They are threatened by three men but put them off with free beer. Doc and a friend are arrested for pot possession. Can Richie&#8217;s girlfriend get a &#8216;schedula&#8217;? Can Richie change his ways? Archbishop Romero speaks to the people in church. Then a man shoots him with a pistol! There is panic and confusion. Richie asks a politician an embarrassing question. [A bad move?] Richie runs into trouble, but is saved when another photographer shows up. Three nuns arrive at the airport. On the road they are raped and shot by a death squad. Who was responsible? Later journalists visit the rebels. They plan to win with their army of 4,000. Is that possible asks Richie? The photographs show their arms.Richie complains about American influence there which brings misery to the people. Richie asks for human decency. The Colonel warns Richie that some men are out to get him. Later they drive to a town where there is fighting and take photographs of the action. The rebels take Santa Anna and raise their flag. The Ambassador orders the restoration of US military aid. This allows Figueroa to advance. Have the rebels become just like the others? [A shared culture.] A helicopter fires rockets. John is hit! Richie and Doc leave the country. They are stopped at the border. Can Richie be saved? Yes. [Too good to be true.] Their bus is stopped. Richie is arrested and Maria taken away.The last sentences tell what happened to them. El Salvador continues to be a major recipient of American military aid. [Do you know how your tax dollars are wasted there?] This is an example of a movie that is at best average because of its story. It can&#8217;t compare to Oliver Stone&#8217;s better movies. &#8216;Platoon&#8217; and &#8216;Wall Street&#8217; were good because of Stone&#8217;s personal experiences. It shows what happens to people who don&#8217;t have &#8220;the right to keep and bear arms&#8221;. Can it happen here? You can look up the Johnson County War in 1893 Wyoming for an example. Millionaires keep trying to oppress the people; its in their interest to do it. The Second Amendment has kept us from the military coups all too common in countries south of the border. Other countries in this area also suffer &#8220;Banana Republics&#8221; from a powerful aristocracy.",3,A Drama About Political Oppression,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,3444,"['Salvador', '1986', 'filmThe', 'story', 'news', 'photographs', 'People', 'are', 'demonstrating', 'streets', 'bodies', 'are', 'ground', '[', 'based', 'events', 'late', '1970s', ']', 'Richard', 'Boyle', 'cover', 'events', 'freelance', 'journalist', 'arrested', 'traffic', 'offences', 'then', 'released', 'friend', 'lost', 'dog', 'Richie', '8217', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'drive', 'El', 'Salvador', 'cover', 'conflict', 'there', 'are', 'stopped', 'road', 'block', 'then', 'taken', 'town', 'One', 'young', 'man', 'glasses', 'suspect', 'are', 'taken', 'military', 'post', 'Colonel', 'Figueroa', 'Richie', 'see', 'old', 'friends', 'young', 'journalist', 'discuss', 'work', 'there', 'work', 'Richie', 'photograph', 'bodies', 'left', 'countryside', 'visit', 'town', 'square', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'gathered', 'Richie', 'job', 'Survivors', 'massacre', 'get', 'medical', 'care', 'volunteers.Richie', 'offered', 'job', 'providing', 'information', 'other', 'journalists', '[', 'conversation', 'sort', 'jerk', ']', 'military', 'man', 'take', 'revenge', 'religious', 'people', '8220', 'will', 'be', 'famous.', '8221', 'Richie', 'load', 'man', 'are', 'threatened', 'three', 'men', 'put', 'off', 'free', 'beer', 'Doc', 'friend', 'are', 'arrested', 'pot', 'possession', 'Can', 'Richie', '8217', 'girlfriend', 'get', '8216', '8217', 'Can', 'Richie', 'change', 'ways', 'Archbishop', 'Romero', 'people', 'church', 'Then', 'man', 'pistol', 'panic', 'confusion', 'Richie', 'politician', 'embarrassing', 'question', '[', 'bad', 'move', ']', 'Richie', 'trouble', 'saved', 'when', 'photographer', 'up', 'Three', 'nuns', 'arrive', 'airport', 'road', 'are', 'raped', 'shot', 'death', 'squad', 'Who', 'was', 'responsible', 'Later', 'journalists', 'visit', 'rebels', 'plan', 'win', 'army', '4,000', 'possible', 'asks', 'Richie', 'photographs', 'show', 'arms.Richie', 'American', 'influence', 'misery', 'people', 'Richie', 'human', 'decency', 'Colonel', 'Richie', 'men', 'are', 'out', 'get', 'Later', 'drive', 'town', 'where', 'fighting', 'take', 'photographs', 'action', 'rebels', 'take', 'Santa', 'Anna', 'raise', 'flag', 'Ambassador', 'orders', 'restoration', 'US', 'military', 'aid', 'Figueroa', 'advance', 'Have', 'rebels', 'become', 'just', 'others', '[', 'shared', 'culture', ']', 'helicopter', 'rockets', 'John', 'hit', 'Richie', 'Doc', 'leave', 'country', 'are', 'stopped', 'border', 'Can', 'Richie', 'be', 'saved', 'Yes', '[', 'Too', 'good', 'be', 'true', ']', 'bus', 'stopped', 'Richie', 'arrested', 'Maria', 'taken', 'away.The', 'last', 'sentences', 'tell', 'what', 'happened', 'El', 'Salvador', 'be', 'major', 'recipient', 'American', 'military', 'aid', '[', 'Do', 'know', 'how', 'tax', 'dollars', 'are', 'wasted', 'there', ']', 'example', 'movie', 'best', 'average', 'story', 'can', '8217', 'compare', 'Oliver', 'Stone', '8217', 'better', 'movies', '8216', 'Platoon', '8217', '8216', 'Wall', 'Street', '8217', 'were', 'good', 'Stone', '8217', 'personal', 'experiences', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'don', '8217', 't', 'have', '8220', 'right', 'keep', 'bear', 'arms', '8221', 'Can', 'happen', 'here', 'can', 'look', 'up', 'Johnson', 'County', 'War', '1893', 'Wyoming', 'example', 'Millionaires', 'keep', 'trying', 'oppress', 'people', 'interest', 'do', 'Second', 'Amendment', 'kept', 'military', 'coups', 'too', 'common', 'countries', 'south', 'border', 'Other', 'countries', 'area', 'also', 'suffer', '8220', 'Banana', 'Republics', '8221', 'powerful', 'aristocracy']",N/A

152559,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792845145,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Oliver Stone had a great year in 1986.  He had two of his most critically acclaimed films picking up awards left and right, ultimately leading him to snagging his very first Directing Oscar (he won again in 1989) for `Platoon'.  Both of his films that year were politically arresting and violent pictures that exploited the chaos that dwells in the heart of life, and while `Platoon' went on to achieve fandom and become one of the decades most respected films, one should not downplay the impact that `Salvador' itself makes on the viewer.  At times Stone can get lost in the chaos and his films in general can become a tad murky as he tries to establish his own consensus on a particular subject, but `Salvador' does a great job of meshing together the breakneck intensity and political controversy with a dry sarcasm that laces each scene.  Woods and Belushi are a great team here.  I'm actually sad that Belushi didn't get an awards run with this, as he holds his own rather flawlessly beside Woods, who delivers a stunning performance.

Woods' character is a chronic liar, rat and bum. When the two get to El Salvador, we are treated to excesses of their disgusting behavior in the midst of a civil war. The El Salvador government is a vicious, murderous dictatorship, executing political enemies, and even stoops to execute the saintly Archbishop Romero.  The communist guerrillas; however, true to Oliver Stone's far-left ideology, are sincere, gentle, loving freedom fighters. Right. In the midst of violent riots, killings, atrocities, etc., James Woods and James Belushi remain drunk, stoned and irresponsible. James Woods lies brazenly to his trusting woman and gets her brother killed. He also lies to the many people from whom he borrows money. Best of all, he makes false confession to his priest to placate his woman, and then lies shamelessly to the priest.  Meanwhile, James Belushi spends his time drugged and drunk, seeking new prostitutes to use. This is one of the worst movies that I have seen.

Then, through the kindness of amazon, I bought myself a 14-CD box of sorrow and pity. If I were prone to nightmares, I'd have Oliver Stone to blame after watching ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""Platoon"", and now, closest to home, ""Salvador"".The film depicts two of the most notorious crimes of the Salvadoran Civil War, both in 1980: the assassination of Bishop Oscar Romero during a Mass and the rape/murder of three American nuns and a lay worker, both factual events, both conducted by rightwing 'Death Squads' with tacit support from the ruling military junta and from the USA. The violence and the rhetoric portrayed in Oliver Stone's film was real. The historical evidence has been compiled and a reasonably balanced account of that civil war from 1979 to 1992 can be read on wikipedia. The death toll was over 70,000, chiefly peasants slaughtered by the rightwing military and paramilitary. The mass graves shown in the film were really there. The massacres occurred. The Death Squads were really there. Roberto D'Abuisson, depicted in the film as 'Major Max', was just as vile a pathological killer as Stone represents him; even the CIA acknowledged as much when it spent two million dollars to support the election of Jose Duarte over D'Abuisson in 1984. The US involvement in the war was real, and all of $7,000,000,000 was lavished on the rightwing junta government by the successive administrations of Carter, Reagan, and Bush 1. Aid to the murderous military reached as high a a million and a half dollars a day at its height under Reagan. America's history of interventions and clandestine operations in Central America is shameful in case after case, in Panama, Guatemala and Nicaragua as much as in El Salvador. I have to give credit to the administrations of Bill Clinton AND George W Bush for NOT adding any major chapters of shame to America's history of despicable support for dictators and oppressors -- for NOT invading Venezuela, NOT intervening in Bolivia, NOT meddling with Brazilian elections -- though of course Bush was too busy making a mess of Iraq to bother with those ""formidable"" little countries south of Mexico.The film ""Salvador"" is undeniably a political denunciation of American misdeeds in Central America. To temper that fact with the notion that it was primarily a ""character study"" of war correspondent Richard Boyle is simply evasive. Oliver Stone wanted to express his condemnation of the right wing, both in El Salvador and in the USA, and he chose the story of Richard Boyle as a vehicle for portraying the horrors of the civil war, not vice versa. Richard Boyle was a real person; he collaborated with Stone on the script for the film. Yes, I'm sure that for him the film was his story, and if he was half as nasty a customer as he made himself appear in the script, he deserves huge credit for honesty after the fact. Actor James Woods convincingly plays Boyle as a sleaze bag, a drunken washed-up mooch, a disgusting human being whose only redeeming quality is a kind of foolish fearlessness. It's a great piece of acting, powerful enough to carry the film as drama even if the viewer is offended by the political message.""Salvador"" was made in 1986, in the middle of the war. In 1987, another prominent assassination occurred, of the moderate politician Herbert Ernesto Anaya, and in 1989 a Death Squad murdered six Jesuit priests and their housekeepers and children. Both crimes excited international condemnations of the US-backed rightwing government, which was unable to suppress the peasant-based Farabundo Marti Liberation Front despite all that American backing. Keep that in mind as you watch the film. The war finally exhausted the country into a passivity that resembles peace in1992, with some resulting efforts toward economic justice. But El Salvador remains a country of desperate poverty and underdevelopment, with remittances from workers in the USA, many of them undocumented, amounting to more than half of the national income for families.As I said, I've bought myself a box of sorrow and shame.",5,You Can't call Me an Oliver Stone Junkie ...,1292198400,"12 13, 2010",2010,4190,"['even', 'occasional', 'fan', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'many', 'films', 'watched', 'first', 'Wall', 'Street', 'just', 'month', 'ago', 'Then', 'kindness', 'amazon', 'bought', '14-CD', 'box', 'sorrow', 'pity', 'were', 'prone', 'nightmares', ""'d"", 'have', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'blame', 'watching', 'Born', 'Fourth', 'July', 'Platoon', 'now', 'closest', 'home', 'Salvador', '.The', 'film', 'two', 'most', 'notorious', 'crimes', 'Salvadoran', 'Civil', 'War', '1980', 'assassination', 'Bishop', 'Oscar', 'Romero', 'Mass', 'rape/murder', 'three', 'American', 'nuns', 'lay', 'worker', 'factual', 'events', 'conducted', 'rightwing', ""'Death"", 'Squads', 'tacit', 'support', 'ruling', 'military', 'junta', 'USA', 'violence', 'rhetoric', 'portrayed', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'was', 'real', 'historical', 'evidence', 'been', 'compiled', 'reasonably', 'balanced', 'account', 'civil', 'war', '1979', '1992', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'wikipedia', 'death', 'toll', 'was', '70,000', 'chiefly', 'peasants', 'slaughtered', 'rightwing', 'military', 'paramilitary', 'mass', 'shown', 'film', 'were', 'really', 'there', 'massacres', 'occurred', 'Death', 'Squads', 'were', 'really', 'there', 'Roberto', ""D'Abuisson"", 'depicted', 'film', ""'Major"", 'Max', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'pathological', 'killer', 'Stone', 'even', 'CIA', 'acknowledged', 'as', 'much', 'when', 'spent', 'two', 'million', 'dollars', 'support', 'election', 'Jose', 'Duarte', ""D'Abuisson"", '1984', 'US', 'involvement', 'war', 'was', 'real', '7,000,000,000', 'was', 'lavished', 'rightwing', 'junta', 'government', 'successive', 'administrations', 'Carter', 'Reagan', 'Bush', '1', 'Aid', 'murderous', 'military', 'reached', 'high', 'million', 'half', 'dollars', 'day', 'height', 'Reagan', 'America', 'history', 'interventions', 'clandestine', 'operations', 'Central', 'America', 'shameful', 'case', 'case', 'Panama', 'Guatemala', 'Nicaragua', 'as', 'much', 'El', 'Salvador', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'administrations', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'AND', 'George', 'W', 'Bush', 'NOT', 'adding', 'major', 'chapters', 'shame', 'America', 'history', 'despicable', 'support', 'dictators', 'oppressors', 'NOT', 'invading', 'Venezuela', 'NOT', 'intervening', 'Bolivia', 'NOT', 'meddling', 'Brazilian', 'elections', 'course', 'Bush', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'making', 'mess', 'Iraq', 'bother', 'formidable', 'little', 'countries', 'south', 'Mexico.The', 'film', 'Salvador', 'undeniably', 'political', 'denunciation', 'American', 'misdeeds', 'Central', 'America', 'temper', 'fact', 'notion', 'was', 'primarily', 'character', 'study', 'war', 'correspondent', 'Richard', 'Boyle', 'simply', 'evasive', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'wanted', 'express', 'condemnation', 'right', 'wing', 'El', 'Salvador', 'USA', 'chose', 'story', 'Richard', 'Boyle', 'vehicle', 'portraying', 'horrors', 'civil', 'war', 'not', 'vice', 'versa', 'Richard', 'Boyle', 'was', 'real', 'person', 'collaborated', 'Stone', 'script', 'film', 'Yes', ""'m"", 'sure', 'film', 'was', 'story', 'was', 'half', 'nasty', 'customer', 'made', 'appear', 'script', 'huge', 'credit', 'honesty', 'fact', 'Actor', 'James', 'Woods', 'convincingly', 'Boyle', 'sleaze', 'bag', 'drunken', 'washed-up', 'mooch', 'disgusting', 'human', 'being', 'only', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'kind', 'foolish', 'fearlessness', 'great', 'piece', 'acting', 'powerful', 'enough', 'carry', 'film', 'drama', 'even', 'viewer', 'offended', 'political', 'message', 'Salvador', 'was', 'made', '1986', 'middle', 'war', '1987', 'prominent', 'assassination', 'occurred', 'moderate', 'politician', 'Herbert', 'Ernesto', 'Anaya', '1989', 'Death', 'Squad', 'murdered', 'six', 'Jesuit', 'priests', 'housekeepers', 'children', 'crimes', 'excited', 'international', 'condemnations', 'US-backed', 'rightwing', 'government', 'was', 'unable', 'suppress', 'peasant-based', 'Farabundo', 'Marti', 'Liberation', 'Front', 'American', 'backing', 'Keep', 'mind', 'watch', 'film', 'war', 'finally', 'exhausted', 'country', 'passivity', 'peace', 'in1992', 'resulting', 'efforts', 'economic', 'justice', 'El', 'Salvador', 'country', 'desperate', 'poverty', 'underdevelopment', 'remittances', 'workers', 'USA', 'many', 'undocumented', 'amounting', 'more', 'half', 'national', 'income', 'families.As', 'said', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'box', 'sorrow', 'shame']",N/A

152573,AZMMN9R6QIL0Y,0792845145,Jeffrey R. Charles,"[1, 6]","This review concerns the condition of the so called new DVD media that this MGM release, Salvador is on, rather than the content of the movie itself.I ordered several movies at one time from Amazon a few months ago, and did not get to view them all during the return window. I did test most of them by just seeing if they would load and start to play, and even spot checked a few chapters, but did not play them clear through because I didn't have the time or desire to watch that many movies in a month.This movie was an MGM DVD, which (along with Paramount and Columbia/Sony) is a brand I've previously had relatively little difficulty with on defects, though I read in reviews that others have had difficulty. (I've experienced some DVDs from some other studios not reliably playing, but won't mention them here.)Unfortunately, when I recently tried to play the Salvador movie, it froze in several places and several parts of the DVD would not play, so it was impossible to watch the whole movie. Inspection of the DVD disk itself revealed that, even though the protective plastic over the data layer (e.g. the bottom side of the disk) was clean and clear, the data layer itself was defective.Viewed from the bottom side, about 80 percent of the data layer has the shiny and metallic look of a normal commercial DVD, except that it has a slight yellow cast when compared to some other DVDs.  The problem is in the other 10-20 percent of the data layer, where some of it appears to be a dull flat gray, even having the appearance of oxidized aluminum sheet metal in places. The low rating is because a movie you pay for and can't watch obviously isn't worth what was paid for it.What is worrisome about the oxidization defect is that it could potentially occur at a later time on other DVDs. This could be a problem, since there doesn't seem to be a way to replace bad disks from some studios. (A suggestion is that studios lighten up on the idea of making backups, especially if they won't replace movies on defective media. A backup could at least salvage what is still readable on a DVD before the whole disk goes bad.) Some movies even become unavailable after a while. A case in point for a movie going off the market is the ""Song of Norway"" movie, which is a completely different genre.Concerning the parts of the ""Salvador"" movie I could see, I thought that the movies ""Romero"" and ""Innocent Voices"" were better movies about what went on in El Salvador.I could not find a way to contact MGM about defective DVDs at their web site, so this is to alert other buyers to be wary of defective disks (regardless of the studio), and to play them CLEAR THROUGH during the retailer's return window whether you want to view the movie that soon or not.  This tends to make it impractical to order many DVDs at once from any seller having a relatively limited return window. Spot checking didn't uncover the defects.While I was looking into this matter, I found that the sites for some other brands of DVDs (Universal and Disney) DID have an easily accessible way to contact them about replacement of defective DVDs.  I haven't discovered any defective DVDs from either of these studios yet, so I can't comment on how satisfactory their process is, but at least they appear to have a process in place that customers can find.I hope this helps potential DVD buyers. Again, this is not about the content of the movie Salvador, but is instead about defects I found in the media it was distributed on. If a solution is found and there is a way to post an update, I'll try to add an update later.",1,"DVD arrived defective.

I rented this because James Woods is so entertaining in almost anything he's in.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the movie itself turned out to be pretty good, too. The movies I liked that Stone directed didn't have a big political message, like U-Turn, The Doors, and Natural Born Killers (ok, that last one was slightly political) The only overtly hit-you-over-the-head-with-the-message scene in this movie is one where Woods and Savage were taking photos of a huge amount of dead bodies in a dump, and there's a subtitle saying &quot;Blah-blah, dumping ground for corpses killed by death squads&quot; (or something similar) Oh really? Thanks for the explanation Mr. Stone, I would have thought they were at the zoo.I probably wasn't supposed to find this movie as funny as I did, but God James Woods was so hilarious. It's just his timing, or the way he says stuff --for example, &quot;Hey man, where else can you get a 17-year old to (perform a sexual act that is unprintable here) for 7 dollars, man? 7...dollars!&quot;--, or something, but he just totally steals the movie. He can just roll his eyes and I start cracking up. If it had a different actor in the starring role who wasn't as entertaining, I doubt I would have bought a copy. He was definitely robbed of a Best Actor Oscar for this movie--there's a scene near the start of the movie where he is barreling down the street in his crappy car and gets pulled over, that made me laugh so hard I played it back for my husband. Some of the scenes where they are driving down to Mexico are very Hunter S. Thompson-esque. The scene in the confessional where he asks the priest if it would still be okay to take a few hits of a joint once in a while is priceless. If you're a Woods fan, what are you waiting for?  Get a copy fast! I can't imagine any other actor in the role, the other acting in the film is great, but he just acts circles around everyone else.Oh yeah, and the movie itself is great, very emotional. You do care about the characters, even the sleazy ones. The ending also was unpredictable, and there a several scary, very tense scenes.

It takes place in El Salvador during in the early 1980s.  War was raging and, depending upon which version you believe, it was either a Civil war against the military government or a potential communist takeover.  People are being murdered every day and it's an awful place to be.James Woods stars as James Boyle, a freelance journalist who had formerly been a reporter in Vietnam.  His life in California is spinning out of control.  He has no money, his wife has left him, and he craves the excitement of being where the action is. He and his disk jockey friend, Doctor Rock, played by James Belushi, drive down to El Salvador, drinking and drugging and spinning bad jokes all the way.  At first it all seems like fun.Then reality hits.  And the two friends are plunged into the violence.  There's one scene after another that made me cringe in horror.  And yet, James Woods is quite a con man and keeps getting himself and his friend out of scrapes by his fast talking and former connections. He falls in love with a local woman, tells it like it is to the American Ambassador, and keeps getting into trouble.  There's lots of action and lots of people getting killed.  And yet, it's mainly about the personalities of the two lead characters.  This adds a light touch to the horror that surrounds them.It's a fast paced film without one dull moment.  I couldn't stop watching and wondering what would happen next.  The DVD extras feature a long documentary about the making of the film.  That was interesting background and added to my enjoyment although by then I was dozing off.

152578,ABE8YHLYSM15G,0792845145,Luke Killion,"[0, 0]","""Salvador"" is a powerful film made by director Oliver Stone, which was released in 1986 while the conflict still raged. With that in light, Stone's statement about the slaughter during El Salvador's civil war is very brave and probes deeply into the roots of the conflict.  Stone's main character is Richard Boyle, a real to life journalist who covered Vietnam and Cambodia before turning to El Salvador in 1980, the first full year of the war which had spilled over the border from Nicaragua after the communist Sandanista government took power in 1979 (though unrest and revolt had gone back centuries in El Salvador and most of Latin America).Boyle is a very interesting character; he is a hardboiled combat photographer, yet his hard drinking and free wheeling attitude is more reminiscent of Hunter S. Thompson than a traditional like Ernie Pyle. He is in the process of being evicted when he decides to head down south from  California to cover the war. In Boyle ,Stone is able to portray both sides of the conflict through Boyle's affiliation with the right wing militiary and the communist backed guerillas in the mountainous north of the country.  This shows the difficult job of a journalist in a war zone, as they must cover both sides and move about the killing zone in an objecdtive fashion.  Though Boyle would certainly be considered a left wing peacenik by some (the US Military and intelligence characters see him that way), his courage in the face of death is admired by all sides.  Boyle acts as a watchdog, monitoring US support of a genocial regime, yet also has their tacit protection.  The tightrope walk that he acts is the most entertaining aspect of the movie as he states in a memorable scene that ""being a leftist doesn't equate to communism in all circumstances"".Though Stone usually looks at his movies from a left wing perspective, he is always able to show both sides of the story.  US military officials say that Salvadoran dictators may be bad, but at least they are controlable. The Defense department officials are very wary of ""another Pol Pot"" coming to power and spreading commmunism throughout all of Latin America, ""leaving Cuban tanks on the Rio Grand.""  This fear of the domino theory is portrayed through believable American officials in the embassy who dislike Boyle's politics, but respect his guts and his ability to bring objective information to the table. Boyle's story mixes real to life events in a concise two hour film, such as the assasination of church officals and nuns and the rise of the ""Mano Blanco"", though he changes the names and dates of some of the events, placing Boyle at the scene of the pivotal events of the Salvadoran war.

One of them Richard Boyle(James Woods) is about to throw up, but only moments later he turns to his companion and says &quot;That Spain shot you  took was great&quot;. Its as this moment that you realise that the film  could have been set in any other trouble spot in the world, and El Salvador  is just a perfect place to present us with the character of Richard Boyle.  Early on in the film, when Boyle arrives in the country, he offers one of  his fellow journalists &quot;Do you wanna go to Angola, great nightlife  there.&quot;As played by James Woods, Boyle is the kind of man who  wakes with a cigerette in his mouth to the sound of his landlord banging on  the door to evict him. He's the kind of guy who would decide to drive down  to El Salvador in a broken down 1960's car with a manic semi-insane disc  jockey in search of a hot story. Only before he can do that, he has to get  out of jail first, where he was sent for having over 200 hundred unpaid  parking tickets. Look at it a little sideways and you have Hunter S.  Thompson from Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas. With this character James  Woods hit the bull's eye. his performance is blisteringly brilliant, manic  and human, crazed, vulgar, cynical yet surprisingly vulnerable. Paul Newman  admitted that he won the 1986 oscar for The Color of Money as an award for  his cumalative career work, not for his unremarkable work in that film.  Salvador's has a great (and under appreciated) actor's greatest performance  and for that alone its worth watching.In the years 1986 through 1991  Oliver Stone released : Platoon, Slavador, Wall Street, Talk Radio, Born on  The Fourth Of July, The Doors and JFK, thats seven films in six years.  Three of these are great films. (Choose your own three). As a result  Salvador feels rushed and incomplete. Its too messy to form a cohesive  whole, and Stone seems desperate to get his message across when the film is  really a character study of the very interesting Richard Boyle. His  criticism of the U.S. government for blindingly supporting any foreign  government, no matter how brutal, so long as they were anti-communist is  well founded. After all the U.S. was partially responsible for keeping  Zaire's Mubutto Seiseiko in power for decades(now up there socialising with  Hitler and Mussolini). But in this film that message seems forced.The  title of this film &quot;Salvador&quot; does not refer to the country, but  translates as &quot;Saviour&quot;. And the saviour is not Richard Boyle  because he goes El Salvador for a good story to restore his long gone  credibility, but he comes back a changed and enlightened man.

It is Oliver Stone's first major movie and it vibrates with the passion and vibrant drive seen in his later works. This movie is so powerful and effective precisely because it feels REAL. There are scenes that almost have a documentary feeling to them. The camera work by Robert Richardson is gritty and rich at the same time while the screenplay by Stone and the real Richard Boyle is filled with wild moments, powerful scenes and hilarious comic touches. The performances are grade-A. James Woods is wicked but with a touching heart in this performance, it's probably his best. Jim Belushi is brilliantly funny. But &quot;Salvador&quot; aside from being a great entertainment, is also an important film document of the realities of war, of what happened in El Salvador and of the realities of what happened there.

Tom Cruise couldn't act his way out of a paper bag until BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. Kevin Cosner dropped his ho-hum dead-panning and actually raised his voice in JFK--and Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Oldman gave the performances of their lives in that film. Stone made it known that Val Kilmer wasn't just another pretty face in THE DOORS. In SALVADOR, one of Stone's first films, he gave James Woods the chance to show his stuff--enough stuff to earn him an Oscar nomination.However, this is not an easy movie to watch, in spite of Woods' brilliant job. If you can ignore the Modern Marxist 101 rhetoric, you have at the heart of this film an original, unfaltering and chilling vision of humanity run amok and evil gloating at its own success. Stone proposes that our lives really aren't our own. They are threatened, not only by the caricatures he makes out of lip-pursing military/industrial/capitalists, but also by the cruelty and savagery he senses in every human being. In one particularly chilling scene, a group of nuns are raped and executed by goons who support the anti-Marxists of El Salvador. Yes, the goons were sent on this mission by higher-ups but they DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT. On top of that, the absolute glee on their faces as they committed this barbaric act was nothing short of demonic sadism. It and several other scenes are awe-filled and disturbing.What saves SALVADOR from being too dark to bear are the spurts of humor. Woods and James Belushi (yes, even James Belushi does a good job) play off each other beautifully; their comical quips and situations remind you of the other side of humanity: the fun-loving, friendship that doesn't get to come out and play too often. These scenes give audiences a chance to catch their collective breath after a scene of brutality, but then... BOOM... the violence is back, and it seems even more disturbing after the light flourishes of comedy. And the gloom seems twice as dark suddennly.I imagine that this was a difficult movie to get made (I've been reading other reviewer's comments on this matter) and I can see why major movie studios in the feel-good 1980s would be unwilling to finance this film: it's too darn-gosh political; it takes place in a creepy foreign country that isn't romantic; there's no romance at all; and worst of all there's no pop music song that can be spun off into a music video and sold to MTV! They must've thought that Oliver Stone was out of his mind. But he wasn't. And it is to our benefit that he pressed on and got it done.

152593,A2GEB05H8G2Z5A,0792845145,Rolltide,"[7, 9]","Ok, so this isn't oliver stone's masterpiece. There are holes all over this thing. The timing of events, the clumsy way he tries to get his message across. Some of the characters are almost wooden, put there just to  fill in the pieces. Stone's objective obviously is to tell the viewer about  the terrible human rights situation in el salvador so americans realize  they were funding the murder of innocent people. He uses the then, recent  historical events of that country to make his point. The murders of arch  bisop romero, the killing of the 5 american church women ect. Stone makes  his point somewhat but feels he has to interject some dialogue in certain  places to make it clear just in case he is not getting through to the  viewer. There is one scene where boyle(woods) basically summarizes the  entire objective.So, what makes this movie worth 5 stars? This movie is  incredibly energetic and unique. It would be an easy cliche to make the  central character, boyle(woods), some sort of hero, a white american  avenger who wants to save el salvador's people. No, boyle is a lowlife who  has lost his journalistic credentials, his wife and son and can't keep his  head out of a bottle of booze. Doyle is self serving. He's not there to  help el salvadoran's but to rectify his own lost opportunities. So he hears  about the explosive situation down there and decides to go. James belusi  plays the fired disc jockey who reluctantly  heads south with boyle not  having a clue what he is getting into. When he begins to have reservations  boyle tells him about all the cheap women and booze down there. Now i can't  imagine what driving from san francisco to el salvador would be like but it  doesn't matter because in a couple of minutes they arrive at the salvadoran  border and all hell breaks loose. From that moment on the movie is non stop  action as people are dropping like flies.The james woods character  alone makes this a 4* movie. This is his finest role and i believe, his  finest performance and that is saying a lot. This is a character that is  almost killed and castrated so many times he's like die hard. Despite this  there are several incredibly funny moments. The woods character is so  amusing it's hard to take him serious when he gets preachy about the  violence around him. The james belushi character is similar. He wants to  get the hell out of there but doesn't have any money so he makes the most  of it by drinking and picking up whores.One thing i didn't like about  this movie was the depiction of the revolutionaries. Wood's character and a  photographer friend played nicely by john savage, get permission to follow  and report on the guerillas. Stone depicts these revolutionaries like they  were hippies living in some commune.Overall this is a very powerful and  entertaining film. Truly different. All the performances are good but it is  james woods who steals the show. He should have won an oscar for this. Buy  this one and also buy romero.

While some of the politics may be handled ham-handedly, Woods manages to introduce moments of comedy, a very human comedy, in a story that is wrought with despair.He plays a journalist whose days of glory have long begun to wane, and with his wife having left him, he is now at the end of his tether for that one good project to get him out of his corner. An article about the sordid goings-on in El Salvadore could very well be that project, so he heads out for there.He is not alone though in his journey. Belushi provides much of the movie's comic relief and is a riot as the kvetching drug-and-booze soaked friend Dr. Rock, who unwittingly comes along for Woods' ride from San Francisco to El Salvador (he thinks they're going to Guatamala), and finds himself being brutalized by Salvadoran military, police, infected by the water (and the &quot;professional&quot; women), generally having a rough time of it.The politically charged screenplay is somewhat clumsily delivered -- with the bumbling passion of a college radical a little too full of himself. The action speaks for itself, dead bodies everywhere, the American military hovering nearby constantly. And just in case we don't get it, the characters lecture us with familiar left vs. right themes, crow with indignation, and denounce the military characters, who are one-dimensional and disgusting. U.S. involvement is simplified far too much. As things stand, we have very little idea of what sort of El Salvadore culture was actually at stake, the movie does a lean job of providing a backdrop to all the mishap and political intrigue.When that clarity does come about eventually, the movie leaves you with a great sense of energy, particularly from Woods' character. &quot;Salvador&quot;, like JFK or Patton, remains one of my favorite high-octane human dramas of all time.A proud DVD for anyone's collections, if only for the memorably pithy quotes, or the brilliant moments of photo journalism shown (it's not easy shooting mass riots, live) or quite simply the most inspired performance of Woods' career!",4,CHARGED HUMAN DRAMA ABOUT THE &quot;NOBILITY OF HUMAN SUFFERING&quot;,1070668800,"12 6, 2003",2003,2145,"['What', 'moving', 'drama', 'full', 'engaging', 'characters', 'sordid', 'engaging', 'politics', 'may', 'be', 'handled', 'ham-handedly', 'Woods', 'introduce', 'moments', 'comedy', 'very', 'human', 'comedy', 'story', 'wrought', 'despair.He', 'journalist', 'days', 'glory', 'have', 'long', 'begun', 'wane', 'wife', 'having', 'left', 'now', 'end', 'tether', 'one', 'good', 'project', 'get', 'corner', 'article', 'sordid', 'goings-on', 'El', 'Salvadore', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'project', 'out', 'there.He', 'not', 'alone', 'journey', 'Belushi', 'much', 'movie', 'comic', 'relief', 'riot', 'kvetching', 'drug-and-booze', 'soaked', 'friend', 'Dr.', 'Rock', 'who', 'unwittingly', 'along', 'Woods', 'ride', 'San', 'Francisco', 'El', 'Salvador', ""'re"", 'going', 'Guatamala', 'being', 'brutalized', 'Salvadoran', 'military', 'police', 'infected', 'water', 'quot', 'professional', 'quot', 'women', 'generally', 'having', 'rough', 'time', 'it.The', 'politically', 'charged', 'screenplay', 'somewhat', 'clumsily', 'delivered', 'bumbling', 'passion', 'college', 'little', 'too', 'full', 'action', 'dead', 'bodies', 'everywhere', 'American', 'military', 'hovering', 'nearby', 'constantly', 'just', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'characters', 'lecture', 'familiar', 'left', 'vs.', 'right', 'themes', 'crow', 'indignation', 'denounce', 'military', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'disgusting', 'U.S.', 'involvement', 'simplified', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'things', 'stand', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'idea', 'what', 'sort', 'El', 'Salvadore', 'culture', 'was', 'actually', 'stake', 'movie', 'lean', 'job', 'providing', 'backdrop', 'mishap', 'political', 'intrigue.When', 'clarity', 'come', 'eventually', 'movie', 'great', 'sense', 'energy', 'particularly', 'Woods', 'character', 'quot', 'Salvador', 'quot', 'JFK', 'Patton', 'one', 'favorite', 'high-octane', 'human', 'dramas', 'time.A', 'proud', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'collections', 'only', 'memorably', 'pithy', 'quotes', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'photo', 'journalism', 'shown', 'not', 'easy', 'shooting', 'mass', 'riots', 'live', 'quite', 'simply', 'most', 'inspired', 'performance', 'Woods', 'career']",N/A

To protect the interests of companies like United Fruit, the US has often intervened in the affairs of those countries to ensure that Americans can buy cheap fruit.El Salvador is one of the smallest countries in Central America. Neighboring Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica are giants in comparison. This means that there is little land available for farming by campesinos. In 1980 a war broke out in El Salvador between the army and the landless peasants in a dispute over land. The war continued until 1992, when a peace treaty was signed.The best introduction to the war in El Salvador is Oliver Stone's film Salvador with James Woods and Jim Belushi. Stone tells it like the nightmare it was, including the brutal murder of innocent peasants by the depraved military and right wing death squads, thanks to the generosity of our Congress and President Ronald Reagan, who funded them with billions of our tax dollars. Tiny El Salvador was one of largest recipients of US foreign aid in the eighties.I also recommend two recent films on El Salvador: Innocent Voices and Maria's Story, which tell the story of the war on landless peasants living in shacks from their point of view.Finally, I recommend an excellent book on one ""battle"" in the US funded war in El Salvador: The Massacre at El Mozote by Mark Danner.",5,Oliver Stone Tells It Like It Was,1281225600,"08 8, 2010",2010,1471,"['Central', 'America', 'region', 'small', 'countries', 'specialize', 'growing', 'bananas', 'mangos', 'papayas', 'other', 'fruit', 'export', 'US', 'market', 'protect', 'interests', 'companies', 'United', 'Fruit', 'US', 'often', 'intervened', 'affairs', 'countries', 'ensure', 'Americans', 'can', 'buy', 'cheap', 'fruit.El', 'Salvador', 'one', 'smallest', 'countries', 'Central', 'America', 'Neighboring', 'Guatemala', 'Honduras', 'Nicaragua', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'are', 'giants', 'comparison', 'little', 'land', 'available', 'farming', 'campesinos', '1980', 'war', 'broke', 'out', 'El', 'Salvador', 'army', 'landless', 'peasants', 'dispute', 'land', 'war', 'continued', '1992', 'when', 'peace', 'treaty', 'was', 'signed.The', 'best', 'introduction', 'war', 'El', 'Salvador', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'film', 'Salvador', 'James', 'Woods', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'Stone', 'nightmare', 'was', 'including', 'brutal', 'murder', 'innocent', 'peasants', 'depraved', 'military', 'right', 'wing', 'death', 'squads', 'thanks', 'generosity', 'Congress', 'President', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'who', 'funded', 'billions', 'tax', 'dollars', 'Tiny', 'El', 'Salvador', 'was', 'one', 'largest', 'recipients', 'US', 'foreign', 'aid', 'eighties.I', 'also', 'recommend', 'two', 'recent', 'films', 'El', 'Salvador', 'Innocent', 'Voices', 'Maria', 'Story', 'tell', 'story', 'war', 'landless', 'peasants', 'living', 'shacks', 'point', 'view.Finally', 'recommend', 'excellent', 'book', 'one', 'battle', 'US', 'funded', 'war', 'El', 'Salvador', 'Massacre', 'El', 'Mozote', 'Mark', 'Danner']",N/A
