And I loved it. Set in the south, Joan plays Eva - a woman who exists for her own comfort and to the purposeful detriment of everyone else. She hoodwinked her rich husband into marrying her, destroying his fiancee for life; has an affair with her husband's friend; and makes his fiancee know darned well it went on. The surprise in the picture is that nobody tells her off. But wait. Someone has something different in mind for this Queen Bee.

Every man in this film is twice the idiot and horny.It becomes messy.And for all of Crawford's gowns and her highfalutin ways, she exposes herself as just as much an idiot of those that she has chosen to surround her.  But Crawford, at 55 or so, is the SEXIEST woman in town.  Really?  Please.The woman is whacked yet no one, no script-writer, or producer, or director, or studio head was going to rein her in.  She, Joan, is taking this role right through the finish line.  Oh, she'll tromp on anyone and everyone to do it.  Snd she'll win.But WTF has she won?  After this film, her career became more disturbed and odd and selfish and distraught.  Yet she was willing to do anyting to prolong her big fame and her questionalbe talent.Sadly, there is no real future for Joan after this film. She winds up always horny and stupid.

In QUEEN BEE, based on the novel by Edna Lee, every member of the Phillips family has their own axe to grind...and it all stems from matriarch Eva (played brilliantly by Joan Crawford).  Eva manipulates everyone around her with precision skill.  In a loveless marriage with alcoholic husband Avery (Barry Sullivan), Eva is also dallying with her cousin's fiancee (John Ireland).  When Eva's distant relation Jennifer Stewart (Lucy Marlow) comes to live with the Phillips clan, Eva's ""sweet sting"" soon infects her as well.  The machinations continue as Eva twists the lives of her family members until they all shatter.Joan Crawford lets the venom flow with her masterly performance as Eva, the queen bee of the title.  Dressed in some gorgeous Jean Louis gowns and filtered through soft lighting, ""La Crawford"" commands the screen in every possible way.  Notice too, how her voice changes from soft and honeyed when Eva is trying to get what she wants, to gruff and unforgiving when her temper snaps.  The brilliant supporting cast includes Betsy Palmer as ill-fated cousin Carol-Lee, and Fay Wray as the jilted Sue McKinnon.  Contract player Lucy Marlow, in one of her first lead roles, provides the innocent core of the story, yet our eyes remain riveted to Crawford.  She was the ultimate Queen Bee!The DVD includes the trailer plus talent profiles and vintage advertising gallery.

Joan Crawford is the biggest asset and the main problem of ""Queen Bee."" Her Eva Phillips comes across as a washed-out version of her character in ""The Women."" She does have a few zingers in this film but  she should have played this role 20 years earlier. As was often the case with later period Crawford films, Joan is overly made up, over-dressed, and laughably too old to have two young children, as she does in ""Queen Bee."" Poor Betsy Palmer is stuck with a drab wardrobe, lousy lighting, and  neurotic dialogue, all designed to make Crawford look better.

Not because it's a great movie, but because Joan worked so hard in this film.Joan plays Eva Phillips, a family matriarch that rules her hive with an iron fist and an iron tongue. Eva has no use for other women, and as far as she's concerned, the men in her life are only good for 1 thing. (Take one guess what that is!) Eva will stop at nothing to manipulate the people around her; the woman is absolutely conniving. The question is, will anyone be able to stop The Queen-Bee before it's too late...?If you're new to Miss Crawford's impressive fifties film resume, might I also recommend:Harriet Craig,Story of Esther Costello,Sudden Fear,Johnny Guitarand ""Female On The Beach.""After you see ""Queen Bee"" you will see why Joan and this film are so loved. Because in this movie Joan is dramatic, very beautiful, fashionable and way to bitchy for her own good. In all her mean-spiritedness, Eva Phillips manages to make Leona Helmsley, Madonna and Barbra Streisand all look like very sweet Disney characters!I also enjoyed Betsy Palmer very much in this movie. Incidentally, I just recently watched a game show that Betsy and Miss Crawford did together many years after this movie. They did that one dramatic part from the movie when Eva says, ""any man's my man if I want him."" It was so funny!!Incidentally, I really love the cover of the VHS for ""Queen Bee.""

Kara Russell ""Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer""","[16, 17]","This was one of Joan Crawford's last Glamour Queen movie roles, before she started doing horror films and TV, and this part itself is transitional, as she plays a legendary beauty, pathological in her manipulations of the people around her.  Despite the huge 1950s eyebrows that could be seen on Joan, Audrey Hepburn, Kim Novak, and others during this period, and the weird heart shaped hairdo, Joan remains both a beauty and a really compelling and totally invested actress.  This was after Joan did POSSESSED and proved she could both underplay and play full tilt.  Here she plays a woman so deeply dishonest that she is unconvincing in every emotion - we don't even know if she believes any of this herself.The real stand out performance of this film is Barry Sullivan as Joan's physically and emotionally scarred husband.  He is completely believable in a roller coaster role.  The prototype of the sexy damaged man.The film itself is average, the script is soap opera predictable, and the biggest mystery (how he got scar) is never revealed, only hinted at.  Despite Joan's title character and her entrance-making Jean Louis wardrobe, this really is an ensemble piece, and everyone does a good solid job in this Southern gothic potboiler.  The ""town and country"" set of this film feels both ostentatiously grand and a little too cramped and small, and that is a good way of describing the whole thing.",4,Gothic Crawford,1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1406,"['was', 'one', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'last', 'Glamour', 'Queen', 'movie', 'roles', 'started', 'doing', 'horror', 'films', 'TV', 'part', 'transitional', 'legendary', 'beauty', 'pathological', 'manipulations', 'people', 'huge', '1950s', 'eyebrows', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'Joan', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Kim', 'Novak', 'others', 'period', 'weird', 'heart', 'shaped', 'hairdo', 'Joan', 'beauty', 'really', 'compelling', 'totally', 'invested', 'actress', 'was', 'Joan', 'did', 'POSSESSED', 'proved', 'could', 'underplay', 'play', 'full', 'tilt', 'Here', 'woman', 'so', 'deeply', 'dishonest', 'unconvincing', 'emotion', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'herself.The', 'real', 'stand', 'performance', 'film', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'Joan', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'scarred', 'husband', 'completely', 'believable', 'roller', 'coaster', 'role', 'prototype', 'sexy', 'damaged', 'man.The', 'film', 'average', 'script', 'soap', 'opera', 'predictable', 'biggest', 'mystery', 'how', 'got', 'scar', 'never', 'revealed', 'only', 'hinted', 'Joan', 'title', 'character', 'entrance-making', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'wardrobe', 'really', 'ensemble', 'piece', 'everyone', 'good', 'solid', 'job', 'Southern', 'gothic', 'potboiler', 'town', 'country', 'set', 'film', 'ostentatiously', 'grand', 'little', 'too', 'cramped', 'small', 'good', 'way', 'describing', 'whole', 'thing']",Queen Bee VHS
384162,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,630365164X,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[6, 11]","There are two basic ways you can look at Joan Crawford's character, Eva, in Queen Bee. You could see the obvious - that she sleeps around on her husband and hurts the people around her. Or you could look deeper and see that Eva is trapped in a loveless marriage to an alcoholic! It comes as no surprise to me that she would want Judd.. The sympathy that Joan generates for her character - near the very end when she loves Avery again, after he begins to at last show affection towards her - was probably not written into the script at all. It certainly wasn't in the book by Edna Lee. Joan takes some of the implications of the story and molds sort of a tragic character...a woman who does wrong because (1) she is surrounded by people who don't care about her and (2) her husband doesn't love her. It's true that the character was designed to be a femme fatale, but I believe Joan didn't view this character as all black and she added a little bit of her artistry to the performance.As for the film, Queen Bee is a class A production. Certainly there are some contrived moments but the overall effect of the movie is very powerful. There is a surreal, larger-than-life quality to its excesses and could be in a genre all its own, thanks mostly to Joan's performance - which is one of her greatest and most memorable. It really proves why Joan is often remembered as the most glamorous star ever - and she had the guts, ambition, talent, and heart to back it all up. I agree with a reviewer who once wrote that Joan treated this film like one of her silents...her eyes convey more emotion than possibly any actress I've ever seen before. Just watch the mirror scene with the cold cream (a scene that has been copied many times but never equalled) or the scene where Joan tells Carol, &quot;Any man's my man if I want it that way.&quot; The look in those sad, haunting Crawford eyes is priceless!",5,Wrong!,1063584000,"09 15, 2003",2003,1895,"['are', 'two', 'basic', 'ways', 'can', 'look', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'character', 'Eva', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'could', 'see', 'obvious', 'around', 'husband', 'people', 'could', 'look', 'deeper', 'see', 'Eva', 'trapped', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'alcoholic', 'surprise', 'would', 'want', 'Judd..', 'sympathy', 'Joan', 'character', 'very', 'end', 'when', 'Avery', 'again', 'last', 'show', 'affection', 'was', 'probably', 'not', 'written', 'script', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'Edna', 'Lee', 'Joan', 'implications', 'story', 'molds', 'sort', 'tragic', 'character', 'woman', 'who', 'wrong', '1', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', '2', 'husband', ""n't"", 'love', 'true', 'character', 'was', 'designed', 'be', 'femme', 'fatale', 'believe', 'Joan', 'did', ""n't"", 'view', 'character', 'black', 'added', 'little', 'bit', 'artistry', 'performance.As', 'film', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'class', 'production', 'Certainly', 'are', 'contrived', 'moments', 'overall', 'effect', 'movie', 'very', 'powerful', 'surreal', 'larger-than-life', 'quality', 'excesses', 'could', 'be', 'genre', 'own', 'thanks', 'mostly', 'Joan', 'performance', 'one', 'greatest', 'most', 'memorable', 'really', 'why', 'Joan', 'often', 'remembered', 'most', 'glamorous', 'star', 'ever', 'had', 'guts', 'ambition', 'talent', 'heart', 'back', 'up', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'once', 'wrote', 'Joan', 'treated', 'film', 'one', 'silents', 'eyes', 'convey', 'more', 'emotion', 'possibly', 'actress', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'before', 'Just', 'watch', 'mirror', 'scene', 'cold', 'cream', 'scene', 'been', 'copied', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'equalled', 'scene', 'where', 'Joan', 'Carol', 'quot', 'Any', 'man', 'man', 'want', 'quot', 'look', 'sad', 'haunting', 'Crawford', 'eyes', 'priceless']",Queen Bee VHS

In fact, the 50s as a whole were great for her, and I'd rather watch a 50's Joan movie than a 40s or 30's--for the most part.  She seemed to be trying out many different things, showing different colors.  All right, most of them pretty garish, but she wasn't afraid to think big.  But in one respect the fifties let her down, and that is her men.  OMG, they are pretty dire, by and large.  Here and there you have someone unique, a Jack Palance, a Sterling Hayden, a Jeff Chandler--not that any of the three are particularly good actors, but they're masculine!  But what's a girl to do when paired up with a dud like Wendell Corey or Michael Wilding or, as in QUEEN BEE, Barry Sullivan and John Ireland, none of whom could keep up with her a minute.  (I can't make up my mind about Cliff Robertson, in AUTUMN LEAVES, a superb picture, but wouldn't it have been better with someone ballsier?  Or should he have been weak and weird, like Cliff?  Oh, the eternal questions when you're ranking the different Joan Crawford eras.I liked QUEEN BEE a lot, but never has Crawford been surrounded by so many inept supporting actors.  Everyone loves Betsy Palmet, me too, but she was not the right actress to play the sister-in-law part.  Fay Wray is great, but Ranald McDougall's screenplay trapdoors her right out of the film after the first ten minutes, and in her play we get the eternally deadfaced Lucy Marlow, with her tiny eyes the size of baby caviare eggs.

Ranald MacDougall's script is like Tennessee Williams without the poetry or the subtext. And it's like Douglas Sirk without the sumptuous color or the inner turmoil those autumnal hues disguise.Eva Philips is possessive, controlling, and self-absorbed, and Crawford plays her to the hilt. What more could any fan ask?A monument of selfishness, Eva fascinates like a cobra about to strike. In one memorable scene, her cousin asks what the doctor said (about Eva's troubled child). &quot;Such extravagant things!&quot; responds Eva. She continues: &quot;Did you see how the doctor trembled as he spoke to me? You'd think he'd never seen a beautiful woman before!&quot;Moments like these are pure gold (or should it be 'honey'?) in this wondrous opera-without-singing.The rest of the cast consists of some more than adequate talent: Barry Sullivan (Eva's booze-soaked, trampled husband), John Ireland (a former lover, still caught by her stinger. He gets one of the best lines: &quot;Whatever you are Eva, you're on wheels!&quot;), Betsy Palmer (the deer in Eva's lethal headlights). Lucy Marlow (another deer, that starlet from the opening sequence of A STAR IS BORN, 1954) is passable. (In a TCM documentary, it is revealed that Crawford really slapped the younger actress with all her might.). Fay Wray makes a brief, but noteworthy appearance early on, a past casualty of Eva's rampaging ego.The DVD is pretty bare-bones.

She's married to Avery (Barry Sullivan)--or Beauty as they call him (despite the ugly scar on his face)--he's turned to drink because of his bitch of a wife.  Avery's sister Carol Lee (played by a perky blonde Betsy Palmer, preparing herself for her later stardom as Jason's mother in 1980's ""Friday the 13th""--""Queen Bee"" is a horror flick of a different kind)--anyway, Carol Lee is in love with Jud (John Ireland), who used to be involved with--yup, you guessed it--Eva! But poor Carol Ann doesn't know this secret.  And when she and Jud announce their engagement, Hurricane Eva doesn't take the news very well.  You'll have to watch the film to find out what happens next to this dysfunctional clan--but four stars of my review belong soley to Joan (the remaining one is for the wonderful black and white cinematography), who is the reason to watch this melodrama.  Her outfits are divine, her face is always lit perfectly in her every scene and her smooth delivery of outrageous lines that slap her ""loved ones"" across the face (and she even delivers an actual slap to one unfortunate soul) is a delight to watch.  If you love Ms. Crawford, then you gotta see ""Queen Bee""--it's one of my favorites of her flicks.  And the DVD also includes the campy theatrical trailer, which is a hoot.  You can't take ""Queen Bee"" too seriously or you'll be horrified by Joan's horrible behavior.

Underrated actress, major star, shrewd businesswoman and questionable mother, and it's in this 1955 homage to all things overstated, that we see her play each of these parts in turn.As the arch-manipulator Eva Philips, Joan excels for a number of reasons: She's clearly the only capable actor in this otherwise awful movie (although John Ireland's performance is very good), and looks absolutely spellbinding in all of her glorious costumes (custom-made by designer Jean-Louis). In fact, if it wasn't for the indomitable Miss Crawford's formulaic scenery-chewing this film would probably never have been converted to VHS, much less DVD.Anyway, trapped in a loveless marriage to a bitter alcoholic, Joan sets about destroying all happiness around her, craving power and attention as her only means of comfort. Her cousin Jennifer Stewart (played in the most woeful manner by the consummately irritating Lucy Marlow)comes to stay and all hell breaks loose as Joan tries her damndest to break up her sister-in-law's engagement to her ex-lover Judson Prentiss (Ireland).Memorable scenes are when Joan learns of their engagement ('Isn't it REVOLTING??!!?'), Joan getting out of a dinner party engagement (nobody does phone like Joan!), and Joan viciously slapping her idiot cousin Jennifer (clearly a real slap, and clearly in response to Marlow's woeful 'acting').This is not a film for film-lovers.

384177,A2G935GMRAUIRW,630365164X,Sandy McLendon,"[44, 46]","A dozen years after her M-G-M contemporaries had settled into their involuntary and disgruntled retirements, Joan Crawford was still in the game. Her ""Queen Bee"" is not the world's greatest movie, but it's not the worst either, not by a long shot.Crawford plays Eva Phillips, doyenne of an Atlanta mansion and married to a facially scarred husband she's nicknamed Beauty, which gives a glimmer of how twisted Eva is. Eva gets her kicks out of manipulating hubby, her old lover, her old lover's fiancee (who is Beauty's sister- this is a very close family, if you know what I mean, and I'm sure you do), and dear cousin Jennifer. Crawford also has two pre-adolescent kids, a biological coup for a fiftyish woman in 1955, when this movie was made.Much has been said and written about Crawford's scenery-chewing in this one, but it's interestingly done. La Suprema Joan uses the movie as a showcase for all the acting tricks she had so painfully acquired over thirty years in front of the camera. So polished had she become, she's able to convey menace simply by entering a room with a smile on her face. And when she gets mean, no one is meaner, as the rest of the cast finds out by slow degrees. Crawford causes one character to commit suicide, and she has a little tour-de-force moment when Eva learns what has happened. She's seated in front of her dressing table, creaming her face, and suddenly, chillingly, loses it when she hears the news. Both the script and the actress have the intelligence to refrain from explaining the reaction. Is she horrified by what she's done? Is she terrified that she has the capacity to do it? Is she just putting on an act expected of her? We don't know, and it's to Crawford's credit that she is able to communicate the ambiguity in the middle of a bit of Grand Guignol.Most other actors in the cast take their cues from Crawford, acting more floridly than they ever had before or ever would again. Barry Sullivan and John Ireland do well by the husband and the lover, respectively. Betsy Palmer attempts to stand up to Crawford's acting and to assume a Southern accent: both efforts were doomed to failure. The great and underutilised Fay Wray plays a Southern belle whom Eva bested in the race to see who could get Beauty to the altar first; she's lost her mind over it, and Wray's portrayal is touching, if overdrawn. The one cast member who comes out smelling like a rose is Lucy Marlow, whose arrival as a guest sets the movie's plot spinning; Marlow is the one natural and unaffected thing in the cast, and in the movie.The camp aspects of the film are many, not least of which is Crawford's appearance -- wigged, sporting Kabuki-like makeup, and corseted so sternly Playtex should have gotten screen credit. Her wardrobe's a delight, with one knockout Jean Louis strapless in black velvet with a white satin fishtail, and more jewellery than you could shake a stick at, much of it Crawford's own. The Southern mansion in which all the action takes place is more lavish than anything really found in 1955 Atlanta (I'm from there, and the Coca-Cola heirs don't live this well), but it's properly grand and creepy.Watch this for what it is- a camp classic. Appreciate it for something else, as well. Crawford was the one star of her generation to have the studio system figured out so well, she was able to survive and prosper during its demise. ""Queen Bee"" may just look like fun to us today, but it's also a document of how hard one actress fought to keep working in the years when the lights were going out on soundstage after soundstage, all over Hollywood. Crawford may be the most villainous villainess ever on-camera, but her performance also reminds us of how ruthlessly she kicked aside the wreckage that was 1950's Tinseltown, and rose above it to get the one thing she wanted above all else: to stay a star.",3,"Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Queen Bee",1022457600,"05 27, 2002",2002,3860,"['dozen', 'years', 'M-G-M', 'contemporaries', 'had', 'settled', 'involuntary', 'disgruntled', 'retirements', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'was', 'still', 'game', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'not', 'world', 'greatest', 'movie', 'not', 'worst', 'either', 'not', 'long', 'shot.Crawford', 'Eva', 'Phillips', 'doyenne', 'Atlanta', 'mansion', 'married', 'facially', 'scarred', 'husband', 'nicknamed', 'Beauty', 'glimmer', 'how', 'twisted', 'Eva', 'Eva', 'kicks', 'manipulating', 'hubby', 'old', 'lover', 'old', 'lover', 'fiancee', 'who', 'Beauty', 'sister-', 'very', 'close', 'family', 'know', 'what', 'mean', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', 'dear', 'cousin', 'Jennifer', 'Crawford', 'also', 'two', 'pre-adolescent', 'kids', 'biological', 'coup', 'fiftyish', 'woman', '1955', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made.Much', 'been', 'said', 'written', 'Crawford', 'scenery-chewing', 'one', 'interestingly', 'done', 'La', 'Suprema', 'Joan', 'movie', 'showcase', 'acting', 'tricks', 'had', 'so', 'painfully', 'acquired', 'thirty', 'years', 'front', 'camera', 'So', 'polished', 'had', 'become', 'able', 'convey', 'menace', 'simply', 'entering', 'room', 'smile', 'face', 'when', 'mean', 'one', 'meaner', 'rest', 'cast', 'out', 'slow', 'degrees', 'Crawford', 'one', 'character', 'commit', 'suicide', 'little', 'tour-de-force', 'moment', 'when', 'Eva', 'what', 'happened', 'seated', 'front', 'dressing', 'table', 'creaming', 'face', 'suddenly', 'chillingly', 'when', 'news', 'script', 'actress', 'have', 'intelligence', 'refrain', 'explaining', 'reaction', 'horrified', 'what', 'done', 'terrified', 'capacity', 'do', 'just', 'putting', 'act', 'expected', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Crawford', 'credit', 'able', 'communicate', 'ambiguity', 'middle', 'bit', 'Grand', 'Guignol.Most', 'other', 'actors', 'cast', 'take', 'cues', 'Crawford', 'acting', 'more', 'floridly', 'ever', 'had', 'ever', 'would', 'again', 'Barry', 'Sullivan', 'John', 'Ireland', 'do', 'well', 'husband', 'lover', 'respectively', 'Betsy', 'Palmer', 'attempts', 'stand', 'up', 'Crawford', 'acting', 'assume', 'Southern', 'accent', 'efforts', 'were', 'doomed', 'failure', 'great', 'underutilised', 'Fay', 'Wray', 'Southern', 'belle', 'whom', 'Eva', 'bested', 'race', 'see', 'who', 'could', 'get', 'Beauty', 'altar', 'first', 'lost', 'mind', 'Wray', 'portrayal', 'touching', 'overdrawn', 'one', 'cast', 'member', 'who', 'out', 'smelling', 'rose', 'Lucy', 'Marlow', 'arrival', 'guest', 'movie', 'plot', 'spinning', 'Marlow', 'one', 'natural', 'unaffected', 'thing', 'cast', 'movie.The', 'camp', 'aspects', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'not', 'least', 'Crawford', 'appearance', 'wigged', 'sporting', 'Kabuki-like', 'makeup', 'corseted', 'so', 'sternly', 'Playtex', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'screen', 'credit', 'wardrobe', 'delight', 'one', 'knockout', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'strapless', 'black', 'velvet', 'white', 'satin', 'fishtail', 'more', 'jewellery', 'could', 'shake', 'stick', 'much', 'Crawford', 'own', 'Southern', 'mansion', 'action', 'place', 'more', 'lavish', 'anything', 'really', 'found', '1955', 'Atlanta', ""'m"", 'there', 'Coca-Cola', 'heirs', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'well', 'properly', 'grand', 'creepy.Watch', 'what', 'camp', 'classic', 'Appreciate', 'something', 'else', 'well', 'Crawford', 'was', 'one', 'star', 'generation', 'have', 'studio', 'system', 'figured', 'out', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'able', 'survive', 'prosper', 'demise', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'may', 'just', 'look', 'fun', 'today', 'also', 'document', 'how', 'hard', 'one', 'actress', 'fought', 'keep', 'working', 'years', 'when', 'lights', 'were', 'going', 'out', 'soundstage', 'soundstage', 'Hollywood', 'Crawford', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'villainous', 'villainess', 'ever', 'on-camera', 'performance', 'also', 'how', 'ruthlessly', 'kicked', 'aside', 'wreckage', 'was', '1950', 'Tinseltown', 'rose', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'wanted', 'else', 'stay', 'star']",Queen Bee VHS

Joan chews the scenery and tries to ruin the lives of those unfortuate enough to be in her orbit. Eva Phillips (Joan) is a selfish, insidious and rotten-to-the-core (rhymes with rich) who appears to be the embodiment of charm and love. In this particular review, I shall refrain from giving away details of the plot for this one: just know that when Crawford gets her much-awaited comeuppance, it's a relief to us all...In her frank, celebrated expose of her famous late mother, Christina Crawford related that she was stunned when she first viewed this film back in 1955 upon its initial release. Why? Christina stated that her mother was EXACTLY like that in her personal life and it took very little acting ability on her part to pull off believably the role of a scheming shrike (!). Whether this is a grossly exageratted statement or not shouldn't matter much to fans of LaCrawford's films, however - the actress got paid for what she projected to her many fans in the audience, not as a model mother.

While Queen Bee isn't drivel, it's no Mildred Pierce either - - but I loved it all the same!Joan plays Eva Phillips and although she is probably a good 10-15 years older than the scriptwriter envisioned, she still looks remarkable.  She is married (unhappily as we will find out) to the alcoholic Avery, whom she stole away from the sweet Sue (played too briefly by Fay Wray).The movie revolves around Eva and Avery's unhappy union, her chasing of Judson, who is enamored of her sister-in-law Carol and with whom she had an affair some years back, and Eva's annoyingly meek cousin Jennifer who has just arrived at their southern mansion.  Soon, the fur is flying, Joan is wearing some fabulous Jean Louis designs and the witty barbs are everywhere.The only weak part of the movie is Jennifer, who is so cowardly and timid, it's a hard sell to think that she's even remotely related to Eva.  Seeing her cowering and tearing up over Eva raising her voice just makes me want to cheer when Eva finally slaps the daylights out of the girl.But one weak character aside, the movie is a fun and exciting 1950s soap opera -- and seeing Eva take out her frustrations with a riding crop is worth the price of the movie itself!Definitely a 5 star movie!!",5,50s Melodrama At Its Finest!!,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,1373,"['Being', 'unapologetic', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'fan', 'could', 'enjoy', 'just', 'cinematic', 'drivel', 'appeared', ""'m"", 'sure', 'have', 'Queen', 'Bee', ""n't"", 'drivel', 'Mildred', 'Pierce', 'loved', 'same', 'Joan', 'Eva', 'Phillips', 'probably', 'good', '10-15', 'years', 'older', 'scriptwriter', 'envisioned', 'still', 'remarkable', 'married', 'unhappily', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'alcoholic', 'Avery', 'whom', 'stole', 'away', 'sweet', 'Sue', 'played', 'too', 'briefly', 'Fay', 'Wray', '.The', 'movie', 'revolves', 'Eva', 'Avery', 'unhappy', 'union', 'chasing', 'Judson', 'who', 'enamored', 'sister-in-law', 'Carol', 'whom', 'had', 'affair', 'years', 'back', 'Eva', 'annoyingly', 'meek', 'cousin', 'Jennifer', 'who', 'just', 'arrived', 'southern', 'mansion', 'Soon', 'fur', 'flying', 'Joan', 'wearing', 'fabulous', 'Jean', 'Louis', 'designs', 'witty', 'barbs', 'are', 'everywhere.The', 'only', 'weak', 'part', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'who', 'so', 'cowardly', 'timid', 'hard', 'sell', 'think', 'even', 'remotely', 'related', 'Eva', 'Seeing', 'cowering', 'tearing', 'up', 'Eva', 'raising', 'voice', 'just', 'want', 'cheer', 'when', 'Eva', 'finally', 'daylights', 'girl.But', 'one', 'weak', 'character', 'aside', 'movie', 'fun', 'exciting', '1950s', 'soap', 'opera', 'seeing', 'Eva', 'take', 'out', 'frustrations', 'riding', 'crop', 'price', 'movie', 'Definitely', '5', 'star', 'movie']",Queen Bee VHS

Something about drinking..."" Joan, Joan, Joan - completely over-the-top in this movie, yet, completely *under*-the-table in her private life. This is her last gasp of her semi-respectable moviemaking period before she gave way to the scream-queen roles and went full-throttle into her alcoholism. ""If this is what America wants, then, by God, I'll give it to them,"" she was quoted as saying at the time. I don't know if it's what *America* wanted to see, but it's certainly what *I* wanted to see - Joan in her best ""mow-`em-all-down"" mode, chewing up the scenery, and looking divine in clothes by Jean Louis (that's *Zsh-an Lu-wee*). They don't make actresses like this anymore - and they certainly don't make movie roles like this anymore. The inherent Joan-violence was more insidious, rather than graphic, as it later became in such charmers as *Berserk* and *Strait-Jacket*. Except at home of course, where Joan performed her Queen Bee routine nightly under the name of Mommie Dearest. Daughter Christina has said that this movie comes very close to home in Joan's portrayal. The story (this time) seems to revolve around Joan (naturally), as Eva Phillips, wife of ""Beauty"" Phillips (Sullivan), who is anything *but*. The arrival of a cousin to fill a rather nebulous ""secretarial"" position for Joan/Eva sets off an ugly chain of events. The secretary, Jennifer, who is ""so quiet we ought to put a bell on you,"" becomes the recipient of one of Joan's famous slaps. A lot of ""Beauty's"" dysfunctional family and friends hang around a lot, including Carol, played by Betsy Palmer (""Carol, don't you look sweet, even in those tacky old riding clothes!""), who hangs around so long, she winds up hanging on the business end of a rope. Everyone drinks a lot and Joan keeps the whole show hopping with her machinations and new outfits for every other sentence. With a particular shot of Joan in an evening gown, standing on the staircase in her home as its calling card, this movie definitely bears several viewings to absorb the excess of high camp, but, like drug store perfume, once absorbed, you'll never quite rid of it.

384187,A1RRPBF14VTAUE,630365164X,Tucker,"[3, 7]","""Queen Bee"" is a must for any Joan Crawford fan. As the self-absorbed southern socialite, Eva Phillips, Crawford barrels through the film, destroying anyone who stands in her way, chewing enough scenery to make even the most ravenous pirahna green with envy, all done with perfect clothes, hair and makeup.The soap-opera like plot revolves around Crawford's Eva (did you expect anything different?). As the film opens, we learn that Eva has already trapped her wealthy husband, Avery (Barry Sullivan) into marriage after destroying his engagement to Fay Wray (who seems to be heavily medicated here...perhaps she should stick to big apes!) Sullivan responds by turning to the bottle. Not the first person Crawford has driven to drink, I'm sure.Still not content, Eva sets her sights on reigniting her love affair with Avery's sister's fiance, Judson (I told you it was a soap-opera). Judson (John Ireland), however, loves Carol Lee (Betsy Palmer) and wants nothing to do with Eva. Unwilling to let a little thing like love stand in her way, Eva schemes to break up the lovebirds and she succeeds in a big way! Finally, Avery decides he can take no more and resolves to put an end to Eva's back stabbing and attempts to atone for past sins (both his and Eva's).The film is not very good and is redeemed only by Crawford's over-the-top performance. Her lines are delivered with such sickenly sweet innocence that she could send any diabetic into a fatal coma!! Crawford's star was beginning to dim at this point but she continued to play the grand diva to the hilt, refusing to give in to a faultering career. Her acting in the film fairly screams....""LOOK AT ME! AREN'T I GREAT!"" Funny stuff on the surface but also kind of sad too.Some of the film's dialouge is delightfully campy as well. After being caught in a near clutch with Judson by her visiting cousin, Crawford sweetly smiles and says, ""I didn't see you. You're so quiet we'll have to put a BELL on you.""

384190,A2ASIT0JYIGHTA,630365164X,William,"[1, 10]","What a disappointing film. A dull storyline, and an overacting Crawford to make it pathetic.  It's not a classic even though on the box it says 'Columbia Classic'.  It's only worth owning if you are trying to get the complete Crawford set. While 'Strait Jacket' was bad too, it is ten times better than this because it has some funny scenes.  Queen Bee fails in two ways - weak storyline, and poor acting from everyone.",2,Not classic Crawford,1036454400,"11 5, 2002",2002,419,"['What', 'disappointing', 'film', 'dull', 'storyline', 'overacting', 'Crawford', 'make', 'pathetic', 'not', 'classic', 'even', 'box', 'Classic', 'only', 'worth', 'owning', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'complete', 'Crawford', 'set', ""'Strait"", 'Jacket', 'was', 'bad', 'too', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'two', 'ways', 'weak', 'storyline', 'poor', 'acting', 'everyone']",Queen Bee VHS
