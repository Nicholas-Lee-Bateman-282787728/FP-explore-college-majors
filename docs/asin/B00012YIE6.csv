791877,A358XP3X4U0X45,B00012YIE6,bookloversfriend,"[6, 11]","This is the kind of film to make every writer's heart go pit-a-pat.  An overlooked writer finally recognized.  A forgotten book rediscovered.  This is the dream of every writer who turns up his nose at mere readers and writes the kind of book his teachers and the critics say is a great book.The unstated assumption (or ""subtext"" if you want to sound hip) of this documentary is that it was the greatness of the book that caused it to be finally discovered and promoted, and the lack of taste of readers and absence of promotion from the publisher that caused it to fail in the first place.But was it?  In spite of a lengthy documentary and hours of talk by ""literary"" figures, we still do not learn much about this book.  The fundamental message is that the disappearance of this book from public view was a mistake.  Is this true?  That is the crucial question.  If the book does not give us, the readers, much of anything, then the publishing-promotion system is functioning the way we want it to function: ridding the shelves of dead wood.  If the book IS rewarding, then the system is not serving us, the readers, whomever else it might be serving.  We already know that the book publication-promotion system frequently shoves in our faces books that give us little or nothing.  To show that omitting this book is really the crime against humanity that the filmmaker wants us to believe it is, he needs to show us that the book does give us something.  And this, he is less than successful in doing.So, what did cause the book not to sell?  What did cause the filmmaker to like this book so much?  Causal assertions are easy to make but difficult to back up.  The book couldn't possibly have failed, could it, because the book was tedious, boring, insipid, with characters that you wouldn't even want to share a brief subway ride with.  No, that couldn't be the cause.  And the factor that caused this one reader to like it so much?  It couldn't be something in his own personal life that this book dealt with?  Or that the book exemplified the criteria that the filmmaker was taught define a good book?  Or that he and the author happened to come from the same social background, so the book rings true?  No, impossible!We'll never know until it's too late--until we've bought the bloody book and found out the hard way.  Probably a few people will like it.  Certainly, many people will praise it because now everybody else and the critics are praising it, and they always like such books because they have good taste.  But some of us will wonder: if the book was all that great, why didn't he make a movie of it, like ""Possession,"" instead of a documentary about finding the author?  Or did he try and couldn't get anyone to put up the money?The bottom line is that, in fact, some good books ARE not promoted--and readers lose out as a result--and that some worthless books ARE hyped--and readers are snowed as a result.  The problem is not whether books should be promoted or not, but who decides, who controls the means of book publication and promotion.  Is there a level playing field?  Does every writer have an equal opportunity?

791878,A16F2K8VG7GDS9,B00012YIE6,"Daniel Friedman ""dfja17""","[8, 10]","Stone Reader is a documentary that is understandably not to everyone's taste but what I found most interesting about it is that it's very difficult to pigeonhole who would be inclined to like it versus who would not.On the surface it would seem that if you have a considerable interest in books and literature the film would be tailor-made for you as it follows director Mark Moskowitz on his search to find the author of his favorite book The Stones of Summer.  While it would be hard to label Moskowitz as deep (he does come across as kind of a goofball) it does contain some interesting insights into writing and literature, particularly from the point of view of an author.  As is germaine to his theme, why do some authors produce one great work and never produce another?The film runs about 30 minutes too long - it should cut off right after the big climactic moment but instead goes on and descends into a talking heads picture.  However, leading up to that point, I admit that I was fascinated by the little mystery that Moskowitz had set up and how he was going about trying to solve it.  I can totally understand how some true, passionate lovers of books would find the film to be problematic and Moskowitz to be a buffoon.  Quite honestly, I could have done without the pans through his bookshelves to show us how well-read he is and how versatile his tastes are - it's self-indulgent.  That being said, there's no doubt in my mind that he's done this as a labor of love and as an expression of his passion for a particular book.The best parts for me are some of the later interviews where Moskowitz is able to more or less spring surprises on his subjects by revealing his motives, all of which eventually lead him further on his quest.  Is it contrived?

Mark Moskowitz' documentary about his search for the long-forgotten author of a book that he loved succeeds at something that I've never seen another movie even attempt.  It revels in the joys of reading and makes devoted readers seem like members of an extended family.  I enjoyed the meandering style of the film.  Finding Dow Mossman, while being an important part of the film, was never the entire point of it.  The conversations about books and authors and the long, lingering shots of shelves full of books is not the filler that some people felt it to be; it goes right to the heart of what this film is about--the love of books.  There are some interesting characters in this movie, too.  I liked Mark Moskowitz' style, enthusiastic but kind of goofy.  I can't remember the name of the old man who was in close contact with Mossman during the writing of the book (Frank Conroy?), but he was delightful, full of good humor and the love of reading.  Mossman himself was a pleasant surprise, not at all the disheveled, disturbed recluse that I had been fearing to see.This film isn't for everyone and I suppose it could have been a bit shorter, but it's a real winner.

I thought the film was an enjoyable ramble by an obviously passionate lover of books. Dow Mossman, once found, proves to be a delightful thinker, and I'm intrigued enough by the whole project to seek out his one novel, The Stones of Summer.After awhile, though, it became evident to me that Moskowitz has bought into a very old-fashioned notion of ""great literature,"" a notion handed down to us from a time when Euro-American men filled nearly every academic, publishing, and book reviewer position. The tendency of such men to universalize their perspectives, that is, to avoid labeling their conceptions of great art as THEIR OWN conceptions, is all over this film. This film is homosocial in that every ""great"" book and author mentioned in it, and every smiling, ecstatic reader and reviewer interviewed, is a man (and with the tokenized exception of Ralph Ellison, white).So, (...).I'm a big enough lover of books to have read most of the great white-guy (and Jewish-guy) lit referenced throughout this film, but I've also read many other great non-white and female writers who never get mentioned here. The macho exclusivity of this film would've probably turned me off more it I were not a white guy myself; as such, I've been lucky enough to realize something that I hope Moskowitz isn't too old to learn: that there's a lot more great art out there than the stuff I can ""relate to"" because I somehow see myself in it.On other thing--you and some of your buddies should rethink your tendencies to fetishize books as collectible objects (like this film's no-doubt-priceless baseballs on their own little display pedestals).

I was caught up in the ""quest for the elusive one"" story that reminded me of Roger and Me and even got me to ponder the greater significance of this type of story, (i.e. Apocalypse Now, Roger and Me).  I came up with the idea that a lot of us expect to meet someone when we die, when we reach the end of the quest.  Whether that person is God or someone from your past or whoever.  Perhaps for that reason, Stone Reader is an archetypal story.Some moments of this movie thrilled me, such as Bruce Dobler's story about how his writing teacher tried to toughen him up into becoming a better writer.  I did notice the amateurish filmmaking technique, but seeing how bumbling an artist Moskowitz was actually made me enjoy the movie even more.(...)

Reviewers here keep talking about how manipulative and (my favorite) ""soulless"" this movie is.  I give Moskowitz the benefit of the doubt.

791887,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00012YIE6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[5, 14]","Stone Reader (Mark Moskowitz, 2002)It seems like a documentary that would be tailor-made for a bibliophile. Mark Moskowitz, book lover, pulls out a book he tried to read years ago and didn't like. This time around, he finds it brilliant, and decides to buy everything else the author wrote. He can't find any other books by the author, and thus becomes obsessed with finding him. Along the way, he talks to teachers, scholars, other bibliophiles, and the like. It's all about the books.All of which is great, in theory. In practice, well, the end result is boredom. Moskowitz himself is not much of a charismatic individual, and much of his delivery is stilted. Once he gets to talking books, he loosens up, but those he's talking with range from the presentable-at-best to the should-never-be-on-camera. The conversations themselves are sometimes intriguing, but are usually made frustrating by a subpar sound mix in places and a lack of subtitles (which, given the abominable sound quality to be found on most DVDs and videos as a seemingly inescapable consequence of the mixing process, are necessary for any film that goes from big screen to DVD/video). By three-quarters of the way through the film, you find yourself not caring whether he finds his author or not.Much of the film's problems could have been eliminated, or at least mitigated, if the twenty or so minutes of shots of nothing had been eliminated. (One gets the feeling they are filler to draw the length of the film out to two hours.) Long, immobile takes of Moskowitz cleaning his pond. Moskowitz driving. Moskowitz on a ferris wheel. No narrative. Just that guitar line, which gets really annoying after two hours.In more capable hands (one thinks, fondly, of Amy Kofman's wisdom in calling Kirby Dick in to do some professional work on her documentary on Jacques Derrida; Dick's intervention saved the film, and made it watchable), Stone Reader could have been something great.

791890,A2RDR5G65D9H84,B00012YIE6,Sebastian Fernandez,"[3, 4]","Just yesterday, the following question was posed to me: Are publishers cutting down in the number of serious literary fiction they provide to the readers? Several aspects should be considered to answer this question and most of them are presented in this movie. It has been a trend in the past that masterful novels become bestsellers only years after first been published. One of the most notorious cases is Heller's Catch-22. Most publishers are guided by profits, and since serious literary work is usually &quot;financed&quot; by other bestsellers, economic conditions may hamper the amount published of the former.This movie is a documentary that shows the quest of Mark Moskowitz to find the author of a book, &quot;The Stones of Summer&quot;, that marked him deeply and left him wondering why Don Mossman never published another book. The viewer finds himself participating in the search that involves finding other readers of the book, talking with people that knew the author either as his peers, publishers, dust-jacket designers or tutors. Some of the interviews will immerse you in the world of books and you will find yourself either revisiting or discovering masterpieces worth reading. The juiciest interview, in my opinion, was the one Moskowitz conducted with Prof. Fiedler, who has a very interesting view of why there are so many one-book writers.This movie is clearly made by a book lover for book lovers, if you do not belong in this category you should not even attempt to watch it or you will get bored easily. However, those people that are always eager to learn about authors and their inner turmoil, novels that are worth reading and how the publishing industry works, will find this movie delightful. I must say that I have not read &quot;The Stones of Summer&quot; and am not planning to do so in the short-term.

Like so many others--and like Moskowitz himself, at first--I couldn't get beyond the first fifty pages.  At least, not yet; I will go back to it eventually.  But I was eager to view the film, so I set aside a time to sit down with a glass of iced tea and an open mind.  I love this film.  Forgive me if I state the obvious here; the film is a documentary.  Within that genre, there are documentaries which are structured in the same way a memoir might be... as the reflections expressed by the central character... but The Stone Reader is not all about Mark Mosokowitz... it is somewhat about his love of books, and how he came to be a reader... but he does allow some fascinating people to simply talk about the mystical processes of first writing a great novel--then finding an audience for that novel.  As all writers know, most works do not go forward simply on their own merit.  It is tragically true that one can write a searingly brilliant piece of work and still have it turned down for publication countless times.There are two distinct types of people who will love The Stone Reader.  Writers will love this film because, yes, we need that validation.  We need to hear that ""there are no rules in publishing"" and that Faulkner had a job shoveling coal for 12 hours a day and that, yes, brilliant novels ""slip through the cracks"" and do not get read.  It is a brutal, solitary life we sometimes lead in order to pursue our passion.  Readers of good books will also love this film, will love hearing the titles mentioned--old friends that they haven't heard from in years.  I had forgotten how Catch 22 and Tender is the Night changed my life in high school. I want to visit them again after watching this film.I was already crying by the end of The Stone Reader... but the best part, the little bit that touched me the deepest, was the tag line at the very end.  As writers, we work alone in the dark, pouring our hearts into the words we string together.  Then we set them adrift on the open sea of humanity, hoping that someday, somehow, they will be swept up by someone and appreciated, whether as a moment's brief delight or as a life preserver to someone drowning in sorrow or something in between.

791893,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00012YIE6,stoic,"[1, 1]","To a bookworm, the plot of the documentary The Stone Reader is irresistible. Filmmaker Mark Moskowitz fell in love with a 1972 novel titled The Stones of Summer. Moskowitz found that Stones' author, Dow Mossman, had never published another novel and had vanished. Moskowitz then began a years-long quest to find Mossman and ask what had happened.It's a shame that Moskowitz could not quite make a film that lived up to this promise. Moskowitz spends far too much time on trivial aspects of the search for Mossman. We see, for instance, Moskowitz flying to Florida to interview the designer of Stones' dust jacket. The man has already told Moskowitz that he doesn't remember creating the dust jacket; when Moskowitz arrives in Florida we learn that, indeed, the man doesn't remember. This two-hour film should have been cut by at least thirty minutes.Moskowitz never establishes why Stones was so meaningful to him; amazingly, after watching for two hours you still don't know what Mossman's novel is about. Moskowitz is socially backward and has trouble engaging other people. This is a huge flaw because Moskowitz fails to recognize some of the best stories that he uncovers. (Most members of the literary community are very helpful, but Moskowitz has trouble interacting with them). I agree with Mr. Weeks of Blacksburg, Virginia, who wrote that the film spends far too much time on the filmmaker and not enough on Mossman.Bookworms will still want to see this film.

791894,A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,B00012YIE6,"Susan K. Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[6, 8]",I was eager to view STONE READER as soon as I heard about is since  the story of promising writer (Dow Mossmon) who seemingly vanished off the face of the earth after publishing one well received novel (The Stones of Summer)  is intriguing.  Director Moskowitz takes this fascinating idea however and pads his movie to a two hour plus length  with information and lingering shots seemed designed to convince the viewer of the brilliance and specialness of HIMSELF!  If this movie had been maybe an hour and a half in length and Moscowitz had stayed on his side of the camera the film could have been great but instead this effort is mediocre and annoying and I'm being generous. Some of the scenes are obviously staged and I am more than a bit incredulous that Moscowitz would have had much difficulty in finding Mossmon in the era of people finding internet search engines.  I was also disappointed by how little attention Moscowitz and the other literary people he interviews give to women writers.  Even with all that I would have been willing to give the film three stars since parts of it are well made but then I come on the Amazon site and find our friend Moscowitz has been involved in a scheme to get people to write positive reviews of his film even if they have never seen it!  No wonder media hog Moscowitz was so fascinated by reclusive Mossmon since they are true polar opposites.,2,Another Documentary Director Who Forgot The Movie Wasn't About Himself!!,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1394,"['was', 'eager', 'view', 'STONE', 'READER', 'as', 'soon', 'heard', 'story', 'promising', 'writer', 'Dow', 'Mossmon', 'who', 'seemingly', 'vanished', 'off', 'face', 'earth', 'publishing', 'one', 'well', 'received', 'novel', 'Stones', 'Summer', 'intriguing', 'Director', 'Moskowitz', 'fascinating', 'idea', 'however', 'pads', 'movie', 'two', 'hour', 'length', 'information', 'lingering', 'shots', 'seemed', 'designed', 'convince', 'viewer', 'brilliance', 'specialness', 'HIMSELF', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'maybe', 'hour', 'half', 'length', 'Moscowitz', 'had', 'stayed', 'side', 'camera', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'instead', 'effort', 'mediocre', 'annoying', ""'m"", 'being', 'generous', 'scenes', 'are', 'obviously', 'staged', 'am', 'more', 'bit', 'incredulous', 'Moscowitz', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'Mossmon', 'era', 'people', 'finding', 'internet', 'search', 'engines', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'how', 'little', 'attention', 'Moscowitz', 'other', 'literary', 'people', 'give', 'women', 'writers', 'Even', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'willing', 'give', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'parts', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'then', 'come', 'Amazon', 'site', 'find', 'friend', 'Moscowitz', 'been', 'involved', 'scheme', 'get', 'people', 'write', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'even', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'wonder', 'media', 'hog', 'Moscowitz', 'was', 'so', 'fascinated', 'reclusive', 'Mossmon', 'are', 'true', 'polar', 'opposites']",N/A
791895,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B00012YIE6,Yasha Banana,"[3, 5]","I find it sad that so many people panned this movie.  There is an unmistakeable element of cynicism in those reviews -- a cynicism that reflects the negativity and misantropy that's rampant in today's culture.I thought the movie was excellent.  I can count on one hand the times I've seen a movie that, at certain points, made me cry.  This was one of them.  For example, when Mark Moscowitz calls Dow Mossman on the phone, introducing himself for the first time, they arrange to meet, whereupon Mossman says: ""I hope I don't disappoint you."" ... That was deeply moving.There is also a fascinating *subtext* to this movie.  On the one hand, Mark Moscowitz took a certain path in life that garnered for him ... a nice house ... a nice income ... a wife, a home and children in the suburbs -- while Dow Mossman took an entirely different path.Moscowitz creates political ads (the truth be damned!); Mossman, on the other hand, in writing his novel sought the truth so intensely that he nearly went mad.  In fact, in the voiceover commentay Mossman says to Moscowitz, in so many words: You're better than what you're doing.  Society should have something better for you in mind.In one of the DVD extras Roger Ebert, a strong advocate for the movie, says to Dow Mossman: I wish you could do a monologue for an hour a day on National Public Radio.  Such is the brilliance of Mossman's observations and even-while-meandering thought-process.I came to this discussion site thinking that not one person would have panned the movie; that it would be heartless not to be moved by the arch of this story -- ""a man reborn,"" personally, professionally and artistically.Not to dwell on those among us who are so negative but, frankly, I find the criticisms of the movie sophomoric.  SO what if Mossman could have been discovered sooner.  So what if the film quality and sound qulaity aren't always great.  So what if Moscowitz included pictures of his house and children and backyard in the movie.  That's not what the movie is about, knucklehead!  Mark Moscowitz *isn't* a smooth, easy-to-swallow narrator.  He's not a craftsman when it comes to making a movie.  Quite the opposite, and that works for the movie, the amaateurishness of it.  because the amateurishness of the ""production values"" only underlines what the movie is about -- CONTENT.  Ideas, discovery, sharing, openness, vulnerability.At first I didn't know what to make of Mark Moscowitz.  But then I realized how much I respected him.  Respected him because he loved books.  And, no, he wasn't ""showing off.""  Moscowitz and Mossman have a quality that all great teachers, all great communicators have -- ENTHUSIASM.  ""En theo"" -- the god or spirit within.  You can't help paying attention to them because all the while you're saying to yourself: ""Hey, if this guy is so excited about what he's saying then I guess there's something to it, I better pay attention. ... Because truly enthusiastic people should be *encouraged* in our cynic-laden society.  They should be respected, not sniped at.One criticism of Moscowitz is that he's pushy.  Forgive me but this strikes me as the kind of comment someone would make who *judges* as opposed to *understands.*  Judgments are easy; they're as common as you-know-whats.  And I don't mean belly buttons.  Understanding, on the other hand, is what life and art and repect for the other person is all about.The world is a big place; filled all too many sad, boring, uninspired, unenthusiastic people.  So that when a handful come along who are excited and engaging and not afraid of showing thier love for books and ideas and the creative process in general (I'm of course speaking of *all* the people in this movie) -- then when push comes to shove, I'm on those guys' side.  Because one thing people like that *aren't* is cynical.Finally, I have the feeling that the people who gave this movie a negative review --from the comfort and anonymity of their computer desks -- hidden, anonymous and, as such, ""private -- I think those people would perhaps be not so judgmental if they had to express their snipping, belittling remarks in a forum of living, breathing people.  I think if that was the case, that is to say, if this discussion was taking place after the showing of the movie or perhaps in a classroom that the shallowness of their remarks might embarrass them.",5,A Peach of a Movie,1266969600,"02 24, 2010",2010,4365,"['find', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'panned', 'movie', 'unmistakeable', 'element', 'cynicism', 'reviews', 'cynicism', 'negativity', 'misantropy', 'rampant', 'today', 'culture.I', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'can', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'times', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'certain', 'points', 'made', 'cry', 'was', 'one', 'example', 'when', 'Mark', 'Moscowitz', 'Dow', 'Mossman', 'phone', 'introducing', 'first', 'time', 'arrange', 'meet', 'Mossman', 'hope', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'was', 'deeply', 'moving.There', 'also', 'fascinating', '*subtext*', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'Mark', 'Moscowitz', 'took', 'certain', 'path', 'life', 'garnered', 'nice', 'house', 'nice', 'income', 'wife', 'home', 'children', 'suburbs', 'Dow', 'Mossman', 'took', 'entirely', 'different', 'path.Moscowitz', 'political', 'ads', 'truth', 'be', 'damned', 'Mossman', 'other', 'hand', 'writing', 'novel', 'sought', 'truth', 'so', 'intensely', 'nearly', 'went', 'mad', 'fact', 'voiceover', 'commentay', 'Mossman', 'Moscowitz', 'so', 'many', 'words', ""'re"", 'better', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'Society', 'should', 'have', 'something', 'better', 'mind.In', 'one', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'strong', 'advocate', 'movie', 'Dow', 'Mossman', 'wish', 'could', 'do', 'monologue', 'hour', 'day', 'National', 'Public', 'Radio', 'Such', 'brilliance', 'Mossman', 'observations', 'even-while-meandering', 'thought-process.I', 'came', 'discussion', 'site', 'thinking', 'not', 'one', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'panned', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'heartless', 'not', 'be', 'moved', 'arch', 'story', 'man', 'reborn', 'personally', 'professionally', 'artistically.Not', 'dwell', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'negative', 'frankly', 'find', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'sophomoric', 'what', 'Mossman', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'discovered', 'sooner', 'So', 'what', 'film', 'quality', 'sound', 'qulaity', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'great', 'So', 'what', 'Moscowitz', 'included', 'pictures', 'house', 'children', 'backyard', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'knucklehead', 'Mark', 'Moscowitz', 'smooth', 'easy-to-swallow', 'narrator', 'not', 'craftsman', 'when', 'making', 'movie', 'opposite', 'movie', 'amaateurishness', 'amateurishness', 'production', 'values', 'only', 'what', 'movie', 'about', 'CONTENT', 'Ideas', 'discovery', 'sharing', 'openness', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Mark', 'Moscowitz', 'then', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'respected', 'Respected', 'loved', 'books', 'was', ""n't"", 'showing', 'off', 'Moscowitz', 'Mossman', 'have', 'quality', 'great', 'teachers', 'great', 'communicators', 'have', 'ENTHUSIASM', 'En', 'theo', 'god', 'spirit', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'paying', 'attention', 'while', ""'re"", 'saying', 'yourself', 'Hey', 'guy', 'so', 'excited', 'what', 'saying', 'then', 'guess', 'something', 'better', 'pay', 'attention', 'truly', 'enthusiastic', 'people', 'should', 'be', '*encouraged*', 'cynic-laden', 'society', 'should', 'be', 'respected', 'not', 'sniped', 'at.One', 'criticism', 'Moscowitz', 'pushy', 'Forgive', 'kind', 'comment', 'someone', 'would', 'make', 'who', 'opposed', '*understands', '*', 'Judgments', 'are', 'easy', ""'re"", 'as', 'common', 'you-know-whats', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'belly', 'buttons', 'Understanding', 'other', 'hand', 'what', 'life', 'art', 'repect', 'other', 'person', 'about.The', 'world', 'big', 'place', 'filled', 'too', 'many', 'sad', 'boring', 'uninspired', 'unenthusiastic', 'people', 'So', 'when', 'handful', 'come', 'who', 'are', 'excited', 'engaging', 'not', 'afraid', 'showing', 'thier', 'love', 'books', 'ideas', 'creative', 'process', 'general', ""'m"", 'course', 'speaking', 'people', 'movie', 'then', 'when', 'push', 'shove', ""'m"", 'guys', 'side', 'one', 'thing', 'people', ""*aren't*"", 'cynical.Finally', 'have', 'feeling', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'movie', 'negative', 'review', 'comfort', 'anonymity', 'computer', 'desks', 'hidden', 'anonymous', 'such', 'private', 'think', 'people', 'would', 'perhaps', 'be', 'not', 'so', 'judgmental', 'had', 'express', 'snipping', 'belittling', 'remarks', 'forum', 'living', 'breathing', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'case', 'say', 'discussion', 'was', 'taking', 'place', 'showing', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'classroom', 'shallowness', 'remarks', 'might', 'embarrass']",N/A
