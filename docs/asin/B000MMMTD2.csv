I'm not a big science fiction fan but I was intrigued by the synopsis of the series so I added it to my queue.  My 14 year old son and I had planned to watch the series over a two night period but we were hooked after watching the first DVD so we just had to watch the whole series!We felt it was very interesting and I liked the characters. It was eerie yet had some comic relief in a few spots and the ""objects"" powers were creative. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the ending was a disappointment.  I initially thought I had missed something so I re-watched the part where the old timer was explaining how his wife went missing.Just today I decided to read the reviews here and found out that this was originally supposed to be a TV series but had not received enough viewers so there was a rush to make an ending.  It did indeed leave me with questions such as: How did that room get there?  Why did the objects have powers?  It would be nice if they would resurrect it to add a better explanation.  I mean, they brought ""V"" back.Regarding the DVD itself, it was annoying that the menu did not work properly and we were forced to either watch the movie trailers or, like me, fast forward though it.  Still, I have already recommended it to several friends and family members for its great concept!",4,Great plot but disappointing ending,1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,1382,"['was', 'recommended', 'DVD', 'rental', 'account', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'science', 'fiction', 'fan', 'was', 'intrigued', 'synopsis', 'series', 'so', 'added', 'queue', '14', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'had', 'planned', 'watch', 'series', 'two', 'night', 'period', 'were', 'hooked', 'watching', 'first', 'DVD', 'just', 'had', 'watch', 'whole', 'series', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'liked', 'characters', 'was', 'eerie', 'yet', 'had', 'comic', 'relief', 'few', 'spots', 'objects', 'powers', 'were', 'creative', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'stars', 'ending', 'was', 'disappointment', 'initially', 'thought', 'had', 'missed', 'something', 'so', 're-watched', 'part', 'where', 'old', 'timer', 'was', 'explaining', 'how', 'wife', 'went', 'missing.Just', 'today', 'decided', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'found', 'out', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'be', 'TV', 'series', 'had', 'not', 'received', 'enough', 'viewers', 'so', 'was', 'rush', 'make', 'ending', 'did', 'indeed', 'leave', 'questions', 'such', 'How', 'did', 'room', 'get', 'there', 'Why', 'did', 'objects', 'have', 'powers', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'would', 'resurrect', 'add', 'better', 'explanation', 'mean', 'brought', 'V', 'back.Regarding', 'DVD', 'was', 'annoying', 'menu', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'properly', 'were', 'forced', 'watch', 'movie', 'trailers', 'fast', 'forward', 'Still', 'have', 'already', 'recommended', 'several', 'friends', 'family', 'members', 'great', 'concept']",The Lost Room

1047588,A3Q6KNHE70J4LA,B000MMMTD2,Alyn S. Rumbold,"[1, 1]","This was one of the most consistently satisfying and engrossing miniseries I'd seen in a long time, whether sci-fi or otherwise. It has been mentioned otherwise about how entertaining motel/hotel stories are, whether ""Identity"" or ""1408"" or even ""Vacancy,"" but ""The Lost Room"" really seems to be unique -- I certainly don't recall seeing anything else quite like it. The story is very intriguing and very well written, the dialogue is believable and doesn't come across as stilted or unreal (in spite of the very surreal quality surrounding the events and the ""objects"" of the tale). Admittedly, there aren't a lot of unexpected twists or turns or similar ""gotcha""-style plot devices, but it's because there don't need to be. The action consistently stands on its own and moves along at excellent pacing; the theme of the story is bizarre enough in its own right without resorting to gimmicks to keep the viewer's attention.I thought the casting was well-done, too -- although the acting is mostly very good, no character stands out in such a way as to overshadow the rest, except perhaps the Joe Miller character (very ably and likably played by Peter Krause), but in a way this all makes sense. This is a tale of ordinary men and women caught up in the midst of an extraordinary state of existence that has somehow overlapped into reality as we know it, and the players all carry it off convincingly. I especially liked the supporting performances by Kevin Pollak (a little different sort of role than I'm used to seeing him in -- both threatening and at the same time sympathetic), Dennis Christopher (who does a nice representation of gradually going nuts), and Peter Jacobsen (who does already-half-nuts in very amusing fashion). I was actually a bit disappointed in the role written for Julianna Margulies -- it isn't particularly strong, and you almost get the sense that, other than characterizing the existence of The Legion, she could almost have not been in the story at all and it would have continued on as before. Margaret Cho, on the other hand, has some fun scenes as a sort of one-person eBay of the abstruse.Aside from the main story thread, what adds flavor to the goings-on are the ""objects"" themselves -- the everyday items that have become, in this reality, artifacts of strange powers ranging from mundanely miraculous to uniquely dangerous, even lethal. I kept wondering to myself, ""How did someone deliberately discover that a particular object sublimates brass? brings memories into tangible existence by swallowing it? lowers blood pressure when its worn?"" There must have been some pretty creative research going on during most of the items' existences.Again, a very well-imagined, well-crafted miniseries. I've seen a number of folks here wonder about whether this is going to be a regular series on SciFi. I found that it was the perfect length, with a good ending that makes sense, and I'm a little bit glad they don't seem to be trying to stretch it into anything longer. I thought ""The Lost Room"" ended just where it was supposed to, though others will probably disagree. Give this one a look; it's definitely thinking-man's sci-fi without the need for elaborate special effects and exotic locations to keep things interesting.",4,A very clever contribution from the SciFi Channel,1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,3260,"['was', 'one', 'most', 'consistently', 'satisfying', 'engrossing', 'miniseries', ""'d"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'sci-fi', 'otherwise', 'been', 'mentioned', 'otherwise', 'how', 'entertaining', 'motel/hotel', 'stories', 'are', 'Identity', '1408', 'even', 'Vacancy', 'Lost', 'Room', 'really', 'be', 'unique', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'seeing', 'anything', 'else', 'quite', 'story', 'very', 'intriguing', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'believable', ""n't"", 'come', 'stilted', 'unreal', 'spite', 'very', 'surreal', 'quality', 'surrounding', 'events', 'objects', 'tale', 'Admittedly', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'turns', 'similar', 'gotcha', '-style', 'plot', 'devices', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'action', 'consistently', 'own', 'moves', 'along', 'excellent', 'pacing', 'theme', 'story', 'bizarre', 'enough', 'own', 'right', 'resorting', 'gimmicks', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention.I', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'well-done', 'too', 'acting', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'character', 'out', 'such', 'way', 'overshadow', 'rest', 'perhaps', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'character', 'very', 'ably', 'likably', 'played', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'way', 'sense', 'tale', 'ordinary', 'men', 'women', 'caught', 'up', 'midst', 'extraordinary', 'state', 'existence', 'somehow', 'overlapped', 'reality', 'know', 'players', 'carry', 'off', 'convincingly', 'especially', 'liked', 'supporting', 'performances', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'little', 'different', 'sort', 'role', ""'m"", 'used', 'seeing', 'threatening', 'same', 'time', 'sympathetic', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'who', 'nice', 'representation', 'gradually', 'going', 'nuts', 'Peter', 'Jacobsen', 'who', 'already-half-nuts', 'very', 'amusing', 'fashion', 'was', 'actually', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'role', 'written', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'strong', 'almost', 'get', 'sense', 'other', 'characterizing', 'existence', 'Legion', 'could', 'almost', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'continued', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'other', 'hand', 'fun', 'scenes', 'sort', 'one-person', 'eBay', 'abstruse.Aside', 'main', 'story', 'thread', 'what', 'flavor', 'goings-on', 'are', 'objects', 'everyday', 'items', 'have', 'become', 'reality', 'artifacts', 'strange', 'powers', 'ranging', 'mundanely', 'miraculous', 'uniquely', 'dangerous', 'even', 'lethal', 'kept', 'wondering', 'myself', 'How', 'did', 'someone', 'deliberately', 'particular', 'object', 'brass', 'memories', 'tangible', 'existence', 'swallowing', 'lowers', 'blood', 'pressure', 'when', 'worn', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'creative', 'research', 'going', 'most', 'items', 'existences.Again', 'very', 'well-imagined', 'well-crafted', 'miniseries', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'number', 'folks', 'here', 'wonder', 'going', 'be', 'regular', 'series', 'SciFi', 'found', 'was', 'perfect', 'length', 'good', 'ending', 'sense', ""'m"", 'little', 'bit', 'glad', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'trying', 'stretch', 'anything', 'longer', 'thought', 'Lost', 'Room', 'ended', 'just', 'where', 'was', 'supposed', 'others', 'will', 'probably', 'disagree', 'Give', 'one', 'look', 'definitely', 'thinking-man', 'sci-fi', 'need', 'elaborate', 'special', 'effects', 'exotic', 'locations', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting']",The Lost Room

The joy is in the journey. The peculiar characteristics of the objects have a surreal quality, an exercise of pure imagination, that is very engaging (Andre Breton would probably have loved this story). The really compelling aspect of Lost Room, I think, is the variety of reactions to these objects. People band together to collect them, worship them, or suppress them; individuals seek them as personal talismans, weapons, valuables, or just to enhance their own self-worth. It gives the story depth, and lifts it into the realm of intelligent SF. Fans of PK Dick, Star Trek, Firefly, and the golden age of SF would probably all enjoy this show.

1047591,A322Z3ELL5VY1X,B000MMMTD2,ArNinetyEs,"[1, 1]","In my search for TV gold that I missed along the way, I happened upon this series. It was a failure for the Sci Fi channel.  More's the pity. While it was left wide open for a sequel or a second series, Sci Fi left it alone because of how poorly it was received.  NOTE: If you are watching it, and it seems as though some ideas behind the Lost Room seem to be cloned from Warehouse 13, just remember that the Lost Room came first.I won't go into details; plenty of other reviewers have done that, and it doesn't bear repeating.What did I like?  It was different, in that it had a reasonably original idea, and turned it into a mystery and a thriller, with some inexplicable (and thankfully unexplained) strange and bizarre events.  Too much explanation easily can ruin a genre story--just look at every Star Trek series iteration from Next Generation onward.  Many of the characters were decently drawn, and the acting was quite good, in most cases.What didn't I like? A few of the characters were a bit too 2-dimensional.  One early villain was a caricature of bad guys, which made him quite annoying.  The big bad had more depth, fortunately. Peter Kraus played the main character, Joe Miller. He wasn't terrible, but I think he played it a bit too understated. Some of the things he saw and did would have left most people catatonic or screaming, at least until they could adjust. But he seemed to adapt just a bit too quickly to the bizarre reality. Once past that, he did make a credible cop and a reasonable father. I think a stronger lead would have made the show better.Conclusion: Same as the first paragraph. I enjoyed its original ideas; I liked its imagination.  Overall, I thought it was a well-executed tale and I both enjoyed and recommend it. I think it would have worked better if it hadn't had such a happy-for-all ending, as it didn't quite fit the tenor of the show.  The loose ends it left were quite acceptable--everything doesn't always have to be tied up in a neat, Hollywood-shaped bow.  Also, if you prefer your genre shows light and sometimes fluffy, stick with Warehouse 13.",4,"Good Series, Imaginative",1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,2102,"['search', 'TV', 'gold', 'missed', 'way', 'happened', 'series', 'was', 'failure', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'channel', 'More', 'pity', 'was', 'left', 'wide', 'open', 'sequel', 'second', 'series', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'left', 'alone', 'how', 'poorly', 'was', 'received', 'NOTE', 'are', 'watching', 'ideas', 'Lost', 'Room', 'seem', 'be', 'cloned', 'Warehouse', '13', 'just', 'remember', 'Lost', 'Room', 'came', 'first.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'details', 'plenty', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', ""n't"", 'bear', 'repeating.What', 'did', 'was', 'different', 'had', 'reasonably', 'original', 'idea', 'turned', 'mystery', 'thriller', 'inexplicable', 'thankfully', 'unexplained', 'strange', 'bizarre', 'events', 'Too', 'much', 'explanation', 'easily', 'can', 'ruin', 'genre', 'story', 'just', 'look', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'iteration', 'Next', 'Generation', 'onward', 'Many', 'characters', 'were', 'decently', 'drawn', 'acting', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'most', 'cases.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'few', 'characters', 'were', 'bit', 'too', '2-dimensional', 'One', 'early', 'villain', 'was', 'caricature', 'bad', 'guys', 'made', 'quite', 'annoying', 'big', 'bad', 'had', 'more', 'depth', 'fortunately', 'Peter', 'Kraus', 'played', 'main', 'character', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'was', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'think', 'played', 'bit', 'too', 'understated', 'things', 'saw', 'did', 'would', 'have', 'left', 'most', 'people', 'catatonic', 'screaming', 'least', 'could', 'adjust', 'seemed', 'adapt', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'quickly', 'bizarre', 'reality', 'Once', 'past', 'did', 'make', 'credible', 'cop', 'reasonable', 'father', 'think', 'stronger', 'lead', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'show', 'better.Conclusion', 'Same', 'first', 'paragraph', 'enjoyed', 'original', 'ideas', 'liked', 'imagination', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'well-executed', 'tale', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'had', ""n't"", 'had', 'such', 'happy-for-all', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'tenor', 'show', 'loose', 'left', 'were', 'quite', 'acceptable', 'everything', ""n't"", 'always', 'have', 'be', 'tied', 'up', 'neat', 'Hollywood-shaped', 'bow', 'Also', 'prefer', 'genre', 'shows', 'light', 'sometimes', 'fluffy', 'stick', 'Warehouse', '13']",The Lost Room
1047592,A3MQAQT8C6D1I7,B000MMMTD2,AverageReviewer,"[3, 3]","I loved this Sci Fi Channel miniseries.  I'm going to write a few spoilers pertaining to the show's setup to help you decide if you want to buy this.  Please don't read on if you don't want any spoilers.First of all, it's Science Fiction but set in the real world with the flavor of a cop show.  The major premise of the show is that a cop finds a key that causes any door the key is used on to open to Room #10 of the Sunshine hotel as the room appeared in 1961, outside of Gallup New Mexico.  So, you walk up to the door in your house but instead of using your key, you use this special key, and viola! the door opens to this room that is lost in time.  Inside the room, it looks like its 1961 in the middle of the day, on a bright sunny day.  You get the ebbie jeebies when you look at the room - it was very well done by Sci Fi.  The room only has one door.  The story does not explore what happens if you try to break a window and step into this weird world that the key opens or anything like that.  When you go to leave the room, the door opens to whatever place you're thinking of that has a room.  So you can travel across the globe by going through the lost room.  With me so far?  One more thing, the room resets everytime anybody leaves with the key... that is to say if you walk in and leave your coat, if you come back, the coat will be gone, apparently lost, forever.Ok, well the room apparently was originally outfitted with everything that would typically be in an occupied 1960s style hotel room like a clock, a pen, clothes, comb, etc.  Over the years, apparently, the people who have used the special key to this lost room have removed many of these typical items.  The items appear to have special and just plain ""weird"" powers in the real world and the items, known as objects, are indistructible in the real world.  For example, a bus ticket has the effect of transporting anyone who comes into contact with it to Gallup New Mexico in today's world and the bus pass is impossible to tear up or destroy.  The comb, appears to stop time for a few seconds while the person runs the comb through their hair.  Etc, etc.  If you take an object into the lost room with your lost room key, and leave it in there, when the room resets, the object reverts back to where it was in 1961.  Objects can be destroyed once in the room but when the room resets, a new similar object will appear to replace it.With me so far...pretty out there.  In the real world, at the Sunshine Motel, there is no room #10 only 9 rooms in the motel.Again, the story has a cop finding the lost room key.  The cop is an average Joe who would probably think this whole lost room and key thig is interesting and the story probably wouldn't have progressed beyond that.  However, accidentally, his daughter winds up in the lost room and the door closes on her and when he goes back into the lost room with the key the room has reset and his young daughter is lost.This sends our poor cop on a quest to find out as much as he can about the lost room and the mysterious objects in an effort to save his daughter.  I won't spoil it from there but suffice it to say that he winds up finding all kinds of weird things like cults surrounding the lost room and the mysterious objects.All kinds of theories float around in the show about how the room came to be lost in time/space/another dimension etc.  One of the best things to me about this show is that they don't explain everything about the room or the objects or what happened.  This is mostly a cop show about a man trying to save his daughter under some decidedly weird circumstances and against bands of people who act weird because they're mostly obsessed with the objects and the lost room.I found it a very entertaining miniseries and it would be great if they made at least another miniseries surrounding this premise/concept.  If you suspend disbelief and enjoy cop shows, this is a wonderfully entertaining miniseries.  I hope this helps you make a decision.",5,I loved it but you decide,1230681600,"12 31, 2008",2008,4003,"['loved', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'miniseries', ""'m"", 'going', 'write', 'few', 'spoilers', 'pertaining', 'show', 'setup', 'help', 'decide', 'want', 'buy', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoilers.First', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'flavor', 'cop', 'show', 'major', 'premise', 'show', 'cop', 'key', 'door', 'key', 'used', 'open', 'Room', '10', 'Sunshine', 'hotel', 'room', 'appeared', '1961', 'Gallup', 'New', 'Mexico', 'So', 'walk', 'up', 'door', 'house', 'instead', 'using', 'key', 'use', 'special', 'key', 'viola', 'door', 'room', 'lost', 'time', 'room', '1961', 'middle', 'day', 'bright', 'sunny', 'day', 'get', 'ebbie', 'jeebies', 'when', 'look', 'room', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'room', 'only', 'one', 'door', 'story', 'not', 'explore', 'what', 'try', 'break', 'window', 'step', 'weird', 'world', 'key', 'opens', 'anything', 'When', 'go', 'leave', 'room', 'door', 'whatever', 'place', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'room', 'can', 'travel', 'globe', 'going', 'lost', 'room', 'so', 'far', 'One', 'more', 'thing', 'room', 'everytime', 'anybody', 'key', 'say', 'walk', 'leave', 'coat', 'come', 'back', 'coat', 'will', 'be', 'gone', 'apparently', 'lost', 'forever.Ok', 'well', 'room', 'apparently', 'was', 'originally', 'outfitted', 'everything', 'would', 'typically', 'be', 'occupied', '1960s', 'style', 'hotel', 'room', 'clock', 'pen', 'clothes', 'comb', 'etc', 'years', 'apparently', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'used', 'special', 'key', 'lost', 'room', 'have', 'removed', 'many', 'typical', 'items', 'items', 'appear', 'have', 'special', 'just', 'plain', 'weird', 'powers', 'real', 'world', 'items', 'known', 'objects', 'are', 'indistructible', 'real', 'world', 'example', 'bus', 'ticket', 'effect', 'transporting', 'anyone', 'who', 'contact', 'Gallup', 'New', 'Mexico', 'today', 'world', 'bus', 'pass', 'impossible', 'tear', 'up', 'destroy', 'comb', 'stop', 'time', 'few', 'seconds', 'person', 'comb', 'hair', 'Etc', 'etc', 'take', 'object', 'lost', 'room', 'lost', 'room', 'key', 'leave', 'there', 'when', 'room', 'resets', 'object', 'back', 'where', 'was', '1961', 'Objects', 'can', 'be', 'destroyed', 'once', 'room', 'when', 'room', 'resets', 'new', 'similar', 'object', 'will', 'appear', 'replace', 'it.With', 'so', 'far', 'pretty', 'there', 'real', 'world', 'Sunshine', 'Motel', 'room', '10', 'only', '9', 'rooms', 'motel.Again', 'story', 'cop', 'finding', 'lost', 'room', 'key', 'cop', 'average', 'Joe', 'who', 'would', 'probably', 'think', 'whole', 'lost', 'room', 'key', 'thig', 'interesting', 'story', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'progressed', 'However', 'accidentally', 'daughter', 'up', 'lost', 'room', 'door', 'when', 'back', 'lost', 'room', 'key', 'room', 'reset', 'young', 'daughter', 'lost.This', 'poor', 'cop', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'lost', 'room', 'mysterious', 'objects', 'effort', 'save', 'daughter', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'say', 'up', 'finding', 'kinds', 'weird', 'things', 'cults', 'surrounding', 'lost', 'room', 'mysterious', 'objects.All', 'kinds', 'theories', 'float', 'around', 'show', 'how', 'room', 'came', 'be', 'lost', 'time/space/another', 'dimension', 'etc', 'One', 'best', 'things', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'everything', 'room', 'objects', 'what', 'happened', 'mostly', 'cop', 'show', 'man', 'trying', 'save', 'daughter', 'decidedly', 'weird', 'circumstances', 'bands', 'people', 'who', 'act', 'weird', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'obsessed', 'objects', 'lost', 'room.I', 'found', 'very', 'entertaining', 'miniseries', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'made', 'least', 'miniseries', 'surrounding', 'premise/concept', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'enjoy', 'cop', 'shows', 'wonderfully', 'entertaining', 'miniseries', 'hope', 'make', 'decision']",The Lost Room

It was one of the FEW things I found worth watching that Sci-Fi Channel ever self-produced. It worked because they put a big budget into it. THIS would've worked on ANY of the mainstream networks because I've shown it to people who are uninterested in any sort of Science Fiction and yet these people enjoyed it and said they'd have liked to have seen a series, it's THAT good. Most said it reminded them of a Twilight Zone type of episode.My favorite points in the show are:- 'The Key' that opens any door and gives you a safe-haven in a pocket universe- the quest to find 'the Vault' - reminded me of a sort of modern day LotR quest if you will- when Wally uses 'The Bus Ticket' and keeps sending the Detective Joe Miller back to old house just outside of Gallup, NM- the various factions vying for the Objects such as the Legion and The Order who took over after the Collectors nearly destroyed themselves- and you just have to feel for the bad guy Kreutzfeld whose son has leukemia and why he uses 'The Quarter' objectI wonder if you could remove the telephone from the room, would it have a power too? Same with the pillows or the coat hangers in the closet. The show never answers any of those questions.Folks, if you like good cop drama mixed with some old fashioned Whodunnit and also like some Twilight Zone unexplained phenomena from the X-Files, then THIS is the show for you.Sadly, Elle Fanning did not get good lines because the writers did not give her much to say or do. The part where she's testing the room with her dad and almost throws a fit when he picks up her favorite stuffed toy is priceless.One of the biggest questions that befuddles me is why didn't she just think of where she wanted to go and open the door?",5,Phenomenal Mini-Series,1224806400,"10 24, 2008",2008,1762,"['loved', 'mini-series', 'was', 'one', 'FEW', 'things', 'found', 'worth', 'watching', 'Sci-Fi', 'Channel', 'ever', 'self-produced', 'worked', 'put', 'big', 'budget', 'THIS', 'would', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'ANY', 'mainstream', 'networks', ""'ve"", 'shown', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'uninterested', 'sort', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'yet', 'people', 'enjoyed', 'said', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'series', 'good', 'Most', 'said', 'reminded', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'type', 'episode.My', 'favorite', 'points', 'show', 'are', 'Key', 'door', 'safe-haven', 'pocket', 'universe-', 'quest', 'find', ""'the"", 'Vault', 'reminded', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'LotR', 'quest', 'will-', 'when', 'Wally', 'Bus', 'Ticket', 'sending', 'Detective', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'back', 'old', 'house', 'just', 'Gallup', 'NM-', 'various', 'factions', 'vying', 'Objects', 'such', 'Legion', 'Order', 'who', 'took', 'over', 'Collectors', 'nearly', 'destroyed', 'themselves-', 'just', 'have', 'feel', 'bad', 'guy', 'Kreutzfeld', 'son', 'leukemia', 'why', ""'The"", 'Quarter', 'objectI', 'wonder', 'could', 'remove', 'telephone', 'room', 'would', 'have', 'power', 'too', 'Same', 'pillows', 'coat', 'hangers', 'closet', 'show', 'never', 'questions.Folks', 'like', 'good', 'cop', 'drama', 'mixed', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Whodunnit', 'also', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'unexplained', 'phenomena', 'X-Files', 'then', 'THIS', 'show', 'you.Sadly', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'good', 'lines', 'writers', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'much', 'say', 'do', 'part', 'where', 'testing', 'room', 'dad', 'almost', 'fit', 'when', 'up', 'favorite', 'stuffed', 'toy', 'priceless.One', 'biggest', 'questions', 'befuddles', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'think', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'open', 'door']",The Lost Room

1047601,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000MMMTD2,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[3, 3]","This is hands down one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. It was a mini-series on the Sci-Fi channel that was originally intended to become a complete series, but for whatever reason it stopped short of that goal. I completely discovered it by accident, just happened to walk past it in a video rental store and it caught my eye, and I'm so glad I did. The imagination was excellent, the existential questions it poses were thought provoking and the overall writing was superb. All the actors did an excellent job, and surprisingly they're mostly nobodies in terms of fame, except for Kevin Pollak and Julianna Margulies, but I think that helped make it even greater because there are virtually no expectations going into this film, so I was pleasantly surprised, perhaps more so than by any other movie/TV show in recent memory. I saw it about a year ago or so but it's stayed in my mind this whole time.  I still find myself thinking about it from time to time, which says a great deal about this show's quality and longevity.  It's rare that I think about a show that often, and it only happens when something truly exceptional comes along.  I own the DVD and several friends of mine who I've introduced it to absolutely love it. There's significant character depth, which is a major plus in my book, and the story goes where you really don't expect it to, which I love, more or less completely unpredictable.  There are almost constant twists and turns, but they're pleasant surprises, and just when you think you've got it figured out, another element comes along that throws a wrench into the wheel and you're left fumbling trying to regain your focus.  It keeps you on your toes and exercises your brain in an unusual but positive way, and that's a precious gift.It's rather ironic considering that the Sci-Fi channel produced it, because more often than not they make nothing but garbage, but this one stands out, it went above and beyond the vast majority of sci-fi shows, so if you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to see it.

The production values are good -- video is a little soft on focus, but otherwise it is pretty to look at. The dialog and acting are reasonably good.This series reminds me a bit of last year's Journeyman series on NBC. It sets the main character in a sort of ridiculous situation -- jumping through time, but not randomly. Seemingly there was a purpose behind it. A purpose seemed evident, and some sort of mechanism was hinted at but never resolved. In the end, you have a fantastical premise, with characters doing their best to resolve problems within the strange situation they faced.In the Lost Room, characters are not jumping through time, but into some other dimension and back to normality. Many devices exist that have  fantastical qualities, used for good or ill by various factions. Two of the characters want to retrieve their lost children. One group has quasi-religious motives in obtaining these devices. Another faction wants to sequester the devices because they feel earth is in danger from this other dimension.In the end, the personal drama of the main character is resolved. The ultimate questions about why these devices exist, who made them, and whether they represent an existential danger or a potential blessing to humanity are not resolved. If you can live with that ambiguity, you may enjoy the personal drama. For myself, I can't say that was enough to justify the four plus hours spent watching the series. I was hooked enough to want to see the end, but having seen it, I feel let down.Mr. T would just say, ""Ain't got time for no jibber-jabber!""Shakespeare would say, "" ...like a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""The Lost Room is not idiotic.

1047614,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000MMMTD2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[96, 111]","LOST ROOM is an intriguing, thought-provoking science fiction mini-series which was shown on the Sci-Fi Channel from December 11th to the 13th in three parts: ""The Key and the Clock,"" ""The Comb and the Box,"" & ""The Eye and the Prime Object."" This show offers up a neat-concept, sci-fi mystery that'll keep you guessing and glued to the set; and the good news, so far, is that there's nary a mention of that played-out plot about space aliens conducting experiments on unsuspecting Earthlings, a card which I was half-expecting this show to play.Here we go now with TONS OF SPOILERS: In the 1960s, a mysterious event transpires at the Sunshine Motel in Gallup, New Mexico, off the famous Route 66. Since then, various everyday objects that had been in Room 10 of that motel - objects numbering around a hundred and now scattered to the winds - seem to have inexplicably gained vast and wondrous powers (a comb that freezes time for 10 seconds when run thru one's hair, a pen that, when clicked, microwaves your enemies, a radio which, when tuned to the right station, grants 3 inches of height, a deck of cards which will disable onlookers, a nail file which induces sleep, etc.). A belief circulating underground is that a grouping of these objects will cause them to exhibit new properties and grant their owner god-like powers, even possibly allowing the owner access to the mind of God... Inevitably, over the past decades, disparate groups have sought these objects for their own varying purposes. Which then brings us to the show's protagonist: Joe Miller.In the course of investigating a baffling case involving two men found burned to a crispy death in a pawn shop, Pittsburg homicide detective and single dad Joe Miller (Peter Krause, SPORTS NIGHT, SIX FEET UNDER) comes upon a magical motel room key which, when used on any convenient door, gives him access to an eternally sun-drenched motel room frozen in time since the 1960s. Miller discovers that, from this motel room, he can reach any destination he calls to mind. He learns of another odd quirk of the room: no matter what he does to it or in it, the room  resets itself to its original composition the next time he enters.His digging of clues leads him to an eccentric named Wally (Peter Jacobson), who owns a bus ticket which teleports whosoever is smacked on the head with it. Wally proceeds to unload pertinent info on Miller regarding the motel room and the amazing objects which had been occupying it. Wally further informs Miller that these indestructible artifacts are drawn to each other, then warns him that people will soon come looking for him - ""bad people"" who are desperate to possess the key. Rapidly after, Miller's quest for truth finds focus tragically close to home when his charming, young daughter, Anna (Elle Fanning, Dakota's younger sis), vanishes in the mysterious Room 10.In his efforts to find his daughter, Miller becomes hunted by his fellow police, who come to believe that he has kidnapped Anna; he also runs afoul of other organizations - various shadowy cabals, some of them despicable and ruthless, bent on collecting the items to gain incalculable powers (such as the determined Karl Kreutzfeld's group) or to talk to God (such as the nutjob Order of Reunification) and the Legion, a supposedly more benevolent group who seeks to protect humanity by destroying these items. Miller must evade the clutches of the cabals and remain vigilant against the Legion as he drastically attempts to unearth the history of the enigmatic Room 10 and the Sunshine Motel. Things get more chancy as it seems the only way to retrieve his daughter is to ferret out the Primal Object, the controlling item which holds dominion over all the other items. But which one is it? Can the aid of several quirky characters and the beautiful Jennifer Bloom (Julianna Margulies, ER), who seems to have secrets of her own, be enough for Miller to survive and gain back his daughter? Well, with the possibility of an ongoing series on the Sci-Fi Channel, I'd bet on it.Viewers seeking a quick and easy resolution to the mystery will be disappointed here as the mini-series concludes with plenty of questions left unanswered. In fact, the last half hour of Part 3 engages more in launching new plotlines than in closing the book on existing ones... again, paving the way for a regular series. The cast is pretty darn good. Peter Krause as the desperate Joe Miller plays up just the right amounts of panicky fatherhood and resourceful detective and does it with a relatable, down-to-earth panache. Kevin Pollak plays the cold and deadly, mob-type boss, Karl Kreutzfeld, with charm and civilized vindictiveness. Pollak, a comedian turned very capable actor, makes you actually feel compassion for his character once you find out his real motivation. Sleazy operator Howard ""the Weasel"" Montague is played with zest by Roger Bart, while Elle Fanning (Dakota's younger sis) is okay as Miller's cute kid. I do feel that Julianna Margulies could've done more with her part; she seemed quite disinterested in the goings-on, but I acknowledge that her role was pretty thankless.The powers-that-be made a good decision in allowing the involving story to become the star of the show, as opposed to bludgeoning us with multiple, flashy special effects. As it is, the effects that do pop up are nicely executed and are perfectly in tune with the story. The budget must've been nice.As I've mentioned, this mini-series is intriguing, and part of the intrigue is that it deliberately chooses to leaves holes in its storyline. Part of whether the viewer ultimately sees this show in a positive light will depend on his or her reaction to the barrage of questions that are left unanswered. The series is wagering that the audience will be so caught up in the mystery that it ultimately chooses to support it. LOST ROOM will have those inclined thinking in philosophical and metaphysical terms, and there might be a bit of quantum physics thrown in that mix, too. And for we lesser mortals - who just aren't built towards intellectual ponderings - fear not; there is enough steady infusion of uneasy alliances, betrayals, plot twists, action, and cool f/x to satisfy our craving for low-brow entertainment. Now, I don't know how well this premise would work as a regular television series; there's a danger that things might get too predictable and stale after a few showings. I'm assuming that each episode would involve the hunt for an empowered object, and really, how many curve balls can you throw to make that consistently interesting? But wouldn't it be nifty to find out?",4,The glass eye's my favorite,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,6633,"['LOST', 'ROOM', 'intriguing', 'thought-provoking', 'science', 'fiction', 'mini-series', 'was',

But I am going to complain about the ending.Some reviewers have implied or stated that the weakness of the ending comes from the unresolved plot lines which may serve as the basis for a series. I agree that those unresolved plot lines can be considered by many to be a weakness. But those unresolved plot lines are not the basis of my complaint about the ending - I'm fine with any number of unresolved plot lines. The real problem with the last episode is that is is simply very weak-it fails to show the creativity, ingenuity, or intelligence of the rest of the series. I'm not going to go into any detail because I don't want to give anything away, but that last episode fails to hold up the high standards of the rest of the mini series. So as you are watching this amazing series and you are heading for the end, expecting that the ending will be on the same level as everything else, be ready for a disappointment because it isn't.

Kuntz ""wakingupin528""","[2, 2]","The Lost Room was the second Sci-fi Channel miniseries that truly redefined the sci-fi genre for television (after the Battlestar reboot), with the other miniseries being The Triangle. With The Lost Room, follow Detective Joe Miller as a murder investigation turns into a quest to keep the universe from unraveling when he discovers a key that has the ability to unlock every door. But this is not the only ""Object"" with extraordinary powers, and it did not come to be by chance. He's also not the only one trying to solve the giant puzzle of the ""Objects"" as shadowy figures and religious fanatics are also out to get the key, and dozens of other ""Objects.""The Lost Room was and is a fantastically entertaining miniseries, with good acting, visuals and a haunting musical theme that will stick with you even after you finish the final episode. The Scifi Channel (now known as Syfy) has a few great TV shows, some decent ones, and limitless God-awful movies, but it always seems that the miniseries' they develop always turn out to be the best. Maybe it's because they invest the most time building the story, moving characters around and creating a memorable climax. Either way, if you love science fiction, some witty/goofy comedy and mystery, The Lost Room is perfect for you. It is TV, so do not expect Leonardo DiCaprio/Denzel Washington high-end acting, but acting from a highly entertaining and well-made blockbuster. The writing is outstanding too, having twists and turns you definitely would not see coming. There isn't much I want to talk about the show because it reveals too much, but I will say, add it to your collection.The downside of The Lost Room, is the formatting they used when they released it on disc. The same thing happened with the incredible Taye Diggs TV show, ""Daybreak."" Poor video quality and sub-par audio; definitely poor distribution. Hopefully one day in the future someone gets these shows released on a truly wonderful Blu-Ray format.

1047625,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000MMMTD2,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[3, 3]","One thing that the Sci-Fi Channel always had going for it, in terms of original programming, was its annual December miniseries. Here, we caught up with impressive revisions of ""Dune"" and its follow-up ""Children of Dune,"" we said good-bye to the brilliant Farscape in ""The Peacekeeper Wars,"" said hello to the new stellar incarnation of ""Battlestar Galactica"" and were treated to one of the most ambitious shows ever--""Taken."" I was, however, less than impressed with last year's Bermuda Triangle hokum ""The Triangle."" Way too long and absolutely nonsensical, it was one of the more ridiculous programs that I sat through in 2005. Well, I could use that exact same sentence to describe 2006s ""The Lost Room.""I went into ""The Lost Room"" with a fair amount of good will. I had already heard some negative things, but I'm a fan of Peter Krause and found the story concept to be intriguing. It's rather hard to describe the plot of ""The Lost Room"" in any kind of logical way, however--so I'll make it brief. Krause, as a police detective, stumbles upon a mysterious motel key. That key can be used in any lock to access a motel room in an alternate world which can then transport you to any destination. Got it? But that's not all. Many other items that also came from this mysterious room exist in the world--all with peculiar powers of their own, ranging from a pen that can fry human flesh to a watch that can hard boil an egg (you heard me). Now, there are those that want to collect these items to exploit their power and, also, a cult of some sort that treat them as a new religion. When Krause's daughter is lost in the alternate universe, he must use his wits, the key, and suspect sci-fi ""logic"" to unravel the secrets of the Lost Room while battling both nefarious groups that want his key.That's all I'm saying plot-wise. It's all rather silly. The powers of the various items are so ludicrous and arbitrary, it caused many unintentional chuckles within the group I watched this with. The series, however, isn't all bad. Krause is a credible and likable hero. I was rooting for him. The supporting cast is engaging, taking things just seriously enough to keep you involved despite what your brain keeps telling you. There is some humor, especially with the objects. And the concept is fairly original. It is all very watchable, even if it's not very good.And while, ultimately, I didn't hate ""The Lost Room""--I do struggle with whether or not it is worth the time investment. Had this been a couple of hours, I'd recommend it as a lark. However, the extra time spent with the miniseries format doesn't give you any appreciable payoff. Its light tone and appealing actors may keep some enthralled, but it is empty calories--at best. The plotting never makes much sense, so spending more and more time in the world of ""The Lost Room"" never added up to more value, for me. Try it if you must--I'm not sorry to have seen it--but it's instantly forgettable in a bad movie way. About 2 1/2 stars.

I just don't think she has had the right parts, but I loved her in ER, even though the writers did her what I considered to be a nasty soap opera turn. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed ""The Lost Room"" for it's eerie turn.

The Lost Room has great and likable characters, top-notch writing and an engrossing plot centered around a room in a motel that is somehow disconnected from regular space and time. All the elements in that room have paranormal attributes that allow the possessor specific powers or abilities, such as stopping time for a few seconds (the comb), being able to unlock any door and go out through any other door anywhere on the planet (the key), overwhelmingly paralyzing people (the deck of cards), suspending all electrical or mechanical functioning of machines (the eyeglasses), the ability to flip and twist people into the air (the scissors), etc.There are more than 30 different everyday objects in the room, all with different attributes or powers, and combinations of 2 or more provide an exponential number of effects that can be created. All this gives potential for YEARS of episodes. While I loved the mini-series, I was bummed that it was never turned into a full-blown TV series. It could have run for at least 5 years, and I'd have watched every episode.The DVD is definitely worth buying and can be watched several times through without becoming tiresome.

Just like the one next to their dining room.By itself a pretty startling statement, but the detective is about to discover that it's only the tip of a massively twisted iceberg.Once used, the key will initially open to a very special place, an intermediate way-station that looks like a plain and sparse motel room in the middle of the New Mexican desert. And, if you don't have the key, is the last place you will ever see. Because without it in your possession, you're erased from existence. Forever.Suddenly Anna is kidnapped. Her captors know he has the key and they want to make a trade. And truthfully, as much as Joe wants to understand the freakish sequence of events that have exploded into his life - he will do anything for his little girl. Anything. Quickly an agreement is made for the exchange. Unfortunately, through a series of missteps, Anna runs back into the motel room to hide - without the key. Horrified, Joe screams at her to stop. A literal second passes, but it's already too late.She's gone.Desperate beyond words, Joe uses a lifetime of detective skills to penetrate and expose the hidden world inhabited by secret societies, twisted cults, quirky characters and powerful dark individuals - all of whom will do whatever it takes to obtain a group of seemingly innocuous objects. A pair of eyeglasses, a nail file, a pack of playing cards, a wristwatch, etc. From across the globe, almost 100 in total, these objects have been lost, found, purchased, stolen, re-stolen, fought over, killing and killed over, with an endless body count attached to each one.They're notable for two things. First, they're totally indestructible. Second, they each have a special power; some benign, others so dangerous as to be considered weapons of mass destruction. Made even more fearful when used in combination with one another. These objects will lead Joe to something that's somewhere between amazing and terrifying at the crossroads of reality.Questions remaining after the mini-series concluded are multitude.Did, as some believe, God himself stay at the motel room? Did his power transfer to the objects upon his death? If not, what are they? And most terrifying - what happens if one person or group successfully reunites all the objects? Questions that, unfortunately, will never be answered in an official canon. Technically, after the series ended, the rights to produce further content were picked up by an independent comic publisher who announced they would continue the story - but they haven't moved on the project in over six years, with no sign that they will resume.

The lost room (a person) functions at a basic level as it has plumbing, electricity and a bed (the person is physically alive) but 100 items from the room (feelings), which a person needs to feel most comfortable and satisfied while in it, are missing (1(00) is a number for wholeness).  In other words, the lost room represents a feeling of emptiness or a missing felt sense of self or perhaps burn out/loss of soul (the protagonist's young daughter goes missing in relation to the room and the series revolves around getting her back.)Each item or object has a specific function and location in the room (organs and muscles store feelings).  Our protagonist, played by Peter Krause, has the mind and courage and ""the key"" (correct attitude) to get her back (and save himself) while others serve as cautionary tales of the risks involved in either trying to do too much alone or in seeking the power of love/spirit for the wrong reasons.  The scene with the two one-eyed men entering the room, disappearing and out appearing the young daughter after re-opening the door seems to be a portrayal of integrating the two sides of a person (love and contempt).A nice sci-fi tale for the task of midlife.",4,Warehouse 13's Trial Balloon?,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",2013,1326,"['borrow', 'phrase', 'Warehouse', '13', 'season', '4', 'Holy', 'Metaphor', 'metaphors', 'are', 'needed', 'when', 'talking', 'soul', 'recovery', 'lost', 'room', 'person', 'functions', 'basic', 'level', 'plumbing', 'electricity', 'bed', 'person', 'physically', 'alive', '100', 'items', 'room', 'feelings', 'person', 'feel', 'most', 'comfortable', 'satisfied', 'are', 'missing', '1', '00', 'number', 'wholeness', 'other', 'words', 'lost', 'room', 'feeling', 'emptiness', 'missing', 'felt', 'sense', 'self', 'perhaps', 'burn', 'out/loss', 'soul', 'protagonist', 'young', 'daughter', 'missing', 'relation', 'room', 'series', 'getting', 'back', 'item', 'object', 'specific', 'function', 'location', 'room', 'organs', 'muscles', 'store', 'feelings', 'protagonist', 'played', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'mind', 'courage', 'key', 'correct', 'attitude', 'get', 'back', 'save', 'others', 'serve', 'cautionary', 'tales', 'risks', 'involved', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'alone', 'seeking', 'power', 'love/spirit', 'wrong', 'reasons', 'scene', 'two', 'one-eyed', 'men', 'entering', 'room', 'disappearing', 'appearing', 'young', 'daughter', 're-opening', 'door', 'be', 'portrayal', 'integrating', 'two', 'sides', 'person', 'love', 'contempt', 'nice', 'sci-fi', 'tale', 'task', 'midlife']",The Lost Room

They did leave a few questions unanswered not the least of which was what caused the incident in the early 1960's in the first place but they had made the mini-series with a possible future weekly series in mind so they couldn't answer everything. It may be too late but it would be nice if Sci-Fi could do a follow up mini-series to wrap up those loose ends. The effects were great, there were stand out performances by the lead actor and actress but the secondary actors were so fantastic as well, especially Dennis Christopher and Kevin Pollack. Overall this mini series was a cut above Sci-Fi/Horror quicky movies the Sci-Fi channel usually makes. No offense Sci-Fi channel, but that's true.Now about the dvd itself. It comes as a two disc set, which you'd expect for a mini-series, but unfortunately on disc one it appears they did a little too much compression and the picture suffers, but only slightly. There are many minutes of ads at the beginning that are difficult to navigate past. Also navigation on the menu is a little frustrating. These are the reasons I gave it four stars instead of five. Not because there is anything wrong with the production itself, which there isn't.There is also a nice little behind the scenes featurette at the end of disc two. Which could have been longer and included more details of this facinating series.Despite my kibizting, I highly recommend viewing this series to anyone who hasn't experienced the world of the ""Objects"".This is an update on July 26, 2011- There has been talk of a possible comic book follow up to the mini-series, but so far it's only been talking and nothing has been published.Update- May 20, 2012- It looks like the comic series is either dropped or on permanent hold, same thing, too bad.

It has many twists, and one can only guess at where the story is really going.A mysterious event at the Sunshine Motel (which we do not witness) caused ordinary things in Room 10 to transform into indestructible objects with extraordinary powers. For example, a bus ticket can teleport a person; a pen can melt a person; a comb can stop time; an eye can vaporize a person; a perfume bottle can suffocate a person; a deck of cards disables people...and the key that opens doors, and teleports a person from one place to another.Some believe these objects are a piece of God, and that by collecting all of them (there are thought to be some 100 objects) one can talk with God. Some form a religion based on that belief. Is this movie telling us that religions are manmade? Did we in the distant past formed religions on circumstances we could not understand and comprehend? Was religion formed in order to understand the unexplained?The story gets really interesting when the detective's daughter steps into a room opened y the Key, and disappears. When her father finally finds the Sunshine Motel, there are only 9 rooms--room 10 does not exist. However, room 10 can be seen through a Polaroid picture, another object of room 10. The occupant is also seen, but I won't spoil the story for you.This is a very entertaining mini-series that I highly recommend to all sci-fi fans.

1047645,A3UZ4VQSFBK0BJ,B000MMMTD2,Shannon Sims,"[2, 2]","Well, Sci-Fi made a good series here.  I've watched it twice now and am still just as intrigued as the first time I saw it.Suggestion to anyone who actually wants to see this film - don't read the lengthy reviews here which catalog the entire plot.  Like Twilight Zone, half the fun of the series is trying to figure out what is going on and making discoveries in time with the cast.So what can I tell you about it WITHOUT giving the plot away?  Well, basically this is a mystery movie - and a bit of a quest movie, a supernatual movie, a light-hearted morality tale - guess it's kind of in a class on it's own.  More importantly, I found it to be a highly entertaining, engaging series.  Even at the end, you still have plenty of questions (which for once is intriguing rather than annoying).  That, in and of itself, is worth watching it for.So, symantics that make the movie great (yes, I'm trying very hard not to give away the story line).Cast - Very Good.Only recognized 2 of them with a few vague memory joggers, but maybe you'll have more luck.  Leads are:  Peter Krause, Elle Fanning, Chris Bauer, April Grace, Dennis Christopher, Julianna Margulies, Kevin Pollak, Jason Douglas, Peter Jacobson, Ewen Bremner, Roger Bart, Chris McCarty, Margaret Cho, Jason Antoon, Hugo Perez, Tim Guinee.  The acting was really down-to-earth, funny when it called for it, genuinely sad or manic when called for.  Pretty good portrayal of normal people dealing with abnormal phenomenon.Writing - Excellent.Characterizations were wonderful.  Again, because they kept the tone realistic instead of focusing on the supernatural, you have both a cast of characters, and a ""cast"" of inanimate objects, all of which have stories you can identify with easily.  I like the fact that inanimate objects had a life of their own.  That's incredibly difficult to do and this show does it well - you feel curiosity, sometimes disgust - and of course the best part is, you can't help wondering what YOU would do with one of these items and wondering what the rest do.Directing/Lighting/Creative -  Very GoodThe 3D in this film was subtle and engaging.  Some new effects I haven't seen and all done in an understated manner that rarely, if ever, overwhelmed the plot or action.  You took a lot of it for granted because it was combined with excellent lighting, sets and physical effects.  Directing - I'm not an expert, but as the pace of these shows really moved while maintaing and ever deepening mystery AND while giving a ton of background information, I'd have to say it was pretty good.So, if you like a new kind of mystery with a unique plot line and being involved in a movie (without being overwhelmed by deep questions, just tickled by them), this is a good watch.",4,Excellent Twilight Zone-esque Mini Series,1222041600,"09 22, 2008",2008,2750,"['Well', 'Sci-Fi', 'made', 'good', 'series', 'here', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'now', 'am', 'still', 'just', 'as', 'intrigued', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'it.Suggestion', 'anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'see', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'lengthy', 'reviews', 'here', 'catalog', 'entire', 'plot', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'fun', 'series', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'making', 'discoveries', 'time', 'cast.So', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'WITHOUT', 'giving', 'plot', 'away', 'Well', 'basically', 'mystery', 'movie', 'bit', 'quest', 'movie', 'supernatual', 'movie', 'light-hearted', 'morality', 'tale', 'guess', 'kind', 'class', 'own', 'More', 'importantly', 'found', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'series', 'Even', 'end', 'still', 'have', 'plenty', 'questions', 'once', 'intriguing', 'rather', 'annoying', 'worth', 'watching', 'for.So', 'symantics', 'make', 'movie', 'great', 'yes', ""'m"", 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'story', 'line', '.Cast', 'Very', 'Good.Only', 'recognized', '2', 'few', 'vague', 'memory', 'joggers', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'have', 'more', 'luck', 'Leads', 'are', 'Peter', 'Krause', 'Elle', 'Fanning', 'Chris', 'Bauer', 'April', 'Grace', 'Dennis', 'Christopher', 'Julianna', 'Margulies', 'Kevin', 'Pollak', 'Jason', 'Douglas', 'Peter', 'Jacobson', 'Ewen', 'Bremner', 'Roger', 'Bart', 'Chris', 'McCarty', 'Margaret', 'Cho', 'Jason', 'Antoon', 'Hugo', 'Perez', 'Tim', 'Guinee', 'acting', 'was', 'really', 'down-to-earth', 'funny', 'when', 'called', 'genuinely', 'sad', 'manic', 'when', 'called', 'Pretty', 'good', 'portrayal', 'normal', 'people', 'dealing', 'abnormal', 'phenomenon.Writing', 'Excellent.Characterizations', 'were', 'wonderful', 'Again', 'kept', 'tone', 'realistic', 'instead', 'focusing', 'supernatural', 'have', 'cast', 'characters', 'cast', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'have', 'stories', 'can', 'identify', 'easily', 'fact', 'inanimate', 'objects', 'had', 'life', 'own', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'do', 'show', 'well', 'feel', 'curiosity', 'sometimes', 'disgust', 'course', 'best', 'part', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'what', 'YOU', 'would', 'do', 'one', 'items', 'wondering', 'what', 'rest', 'do.Directing/Lighting/Creative', 'Very', 'GoodThe', '3D', 'film', 'was', 'subtle', 'engaging', 'new', 'effects', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'done', 'understated', 'manner', 'rarely', 'ever', 'overwhelmed', 'plot', 'action', 'took', 'lot', 'granted', 'was', 'combined', 'excellent', 'lighting', 'sets', 'physical', 'effects', 'Directing', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'pace', 'shows', 'really', 'moved', 'maintaing', 'ever', 'deepening', 'mystery', 'giving', 'ton', 'background', 'information', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'was', 'pretty', 'good.So', 'like', 'new', 'kind', 'mystery', 'unique', 'plot', 'line', 'being', 'involved', 'movie', 'being', 'overwhelmed', 'deep', 'questions', 'just', 'tickled', 'good', 'watch']",The Lost Room

Wonderful concept, extraordinarily well written, reminiscent in some respects of some of the novels of Tim Powers. The strong script seems to have been a factor in assembling an excellent cast, both for the principals and for the minor charactersSome viewers may be disappointed that, although the main story is resolved, aspects of the central mystery remain, and there are some dangling plot elements obviously left as a basis for sequels.

Apparently there was a motel room where something happened - nobody really knows what or why - and this motel room has become than a place and the things inside have become more than mere items. After a series of events he comes in contact with an item that leads to that strange room and finds that even though there are things like a pen with the ability to microwave items, the seemingly useless that do things like hardboil eggs, and even a bus ticket that lead to the middle of nowhere, he can't seem to find the most important thing ever left in the room - his daughter.And unlocking THAT means unlocking the mysteries of The Lost Room and the items inside.When it comes to Sci-Fi Channel miniseries, I really love watching them BUT I really don't recommend that many of them to other people. Apparently they have the ability to underfund and not poorly produce already bad scripts, and sometimes that means that the Sci-fi channel gets overlooked. When it comes to items like The Lost Room that is really a tragedy, too, because this 4-part miniseries was one that really kept me watching. Even the introduction of ""the room"" was wonderfully done - I was surprised by that one, too, because even the best series normally has a slow start - and the storyline kept you guessing. You have all these items that you really don't ""know,"" all these people with fixations on items that are sometimes mesmerizing and sometimes mortifying, and then you have the ""the room"" itself and what transpired then. I REALLY enjoyed the items and guessing their powers; sometimes the things and what they do seem useless until you see the way they are utilized and then how they all fit together. Breaking all of that down, keeping track of the macro to the micro, made for a great presentation.

All the objects in the room suddenly have mysterious, weird powers attributed to them. When police officer Joe Miller(Peter Krause)accidently comes into possession of a key to room 10 where the ""event"" happened, he finds that the key when used can teleport him anywhere he has been before. More importantly is the place that he has to go before being teleported--a room from that motel that no longer exists. When Joe's daughter uses the key to escape from thugs intend on taking the key from Joe she disappears. Suddenly Joe is thrust into a world full of conspiracy as he discovers multiple warring groups--the Legion a group dedicated to eliminating the objects, a group that worships the objects and believes they will provide them with access to God and a wealthy man (Kevin Pollack) who wants the key and objects for his own reasons.END OF SPOILERS:Featuring a top notch cast including Roger Bart, Dennis Christopher, Julianna Margulies and Margaret Cho ""The Lost Room"" never stays past check out time. The mini-series does leave some dangling loose ends that could be followed up in a sequel or TV series but the main story is self contained with a solid resolution. Although the main question doesn't get answered (what occurred? Who caused it to occur and why?) like many magicians tricks knowing how something was done doesn't necessarily improve the trick itself and could diminish its impact.Although some of the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more and we had a number of lingering mysteries, the show still managed to be engaging, intelligent and fun to watch. The show isn't overwhelmed by CGI effects which gives the focus over to the drama where it belongs.The show looks so-so. It's poorly authored and has edge enhancement, aliasing and a whole lot of digital artifacts. The only extra we get is a 18 minute featurette but its pretty comprehensive; we hear about the inspiration for the mini-series through to the casting process and production.

1047654,A3QJT3VQ5ZA8FB,B000MMMTD2,"WayneXtreme ""Reading Fiend""","[10, 11]","The Lost Room was a miniseries that aired in December of '06.  The series consisted of six 1-Hour episodes, but airs as three 2-Hour episodes (The Key and The Clock, The Comb and the Box, and The Eye and the Prime Object).  The show itself is about a mysterious room that because of a mysterious even has disappeared from the world , born inside the room itself some 100 objects have been created each with their own unique power, some of the powers are pretty lame and some of the powers are extremely dangerous.Unfortunately, for one cop (Detective Joe Miller), The Lost Room takes his greatest treasure, his young daughter.  After finding The Key, an object that has the ability to open any door and take the user to wherever they want (as long as there is a door).  After an encounter with the man in possession of The Pen, Joe Miller's daughter ends up in the room and is lost to Joe.  Now, Joe must make alliances to try to find the right objects that he needs to bring his daughter back.Now, I will give a quick preview of the ""3"" episodes and will list the objects that are seen within them.The Key and The Clock - Detective Joe Miller is investigating a crime scene in which two men have been burned to death.  After the sole survivor of the shop is fatally wounded, he passes the mysterious Key onto Joe Miller who quickly discovers the power that the key possesses.  The man who murdered the two men kidnaps Joe's daughter and demands that Joe trade the Key for his daughter, but after the deal goes bad, Joe's daughter ends up lost in the room.  But this isn't the only trouble in Joe's life, as his daughter disappears, as Joe is going through a divorce & custody battle his daughter disappears and on top of all that Joe is then blamed for the murder of his partner.  Now, Joe must evade capture while he searches for the objects to bring his daughter back.In this episode we are introduced to: The Motel Key, The Bus Ticket, The Pen, The Clock, The Nail File, The Pencil, The Watch, and the Radio.The Comb and The Box - As Joe runs from the police, he joins up with a member of a mysterious group known as The Legion who collects the objects from the room.  As the two travel from place to place, learning about the objects and their mysterious power, the real murder of Joe's partner because to hunt for an object that will gain him membership into another mysterious group known as The Order of the Reunification who believe that reuniting the objects will allow them to speak to God.In this episode we are introduced to: The Deck of Cards, The Comb, The Overcoat, and The Clockbox.The Eye and The Prime Object - Joe now believes that he knowns of the object that will bring his daughter back to him, The Prime Object.  Now Joe is partnered up with Karl Kreutzfeld as the two search for a vault that contains several valuable items that were gathered up by the first group to collect the objects known as The Collectors.  However, Joe's new ""partner"" has pans of his own as he searches for The Glass Eye, the object that can destroy or rebuild flesh.  But, alliances must be broken as Joe doesn't seem to agree with Kreutzfeld's plans.  As Kreutzfeld runs off to complete his own plans, Joe searches for the Prime Obeject who is also known as The Occupant, the man who was in Room 10 before and during the events that caused it to disappear and to create the objects.In this episode, we are introduced to: The Quarter, The Scissors, The Flask, The Cufflink, The Glass Eye, The Portrait, and The Prime Object (there are several other objects viewed in the vault, but most are just quick glances).I can't give away any more details without giving away some of the most important parts of the storyline, but trust me, the ending will probably upset most of you, at least anyone who dislikes ""open endings"".  However, the minds behind the show are hoping to tie up all of the loose ends in the show in a continuation somewhere down the road.As for the show, itself, it's awesome, the objects, the actors, the story, it's all great.  This has to be one of the best original creations to come out of SciFi in a very long time.  The story is something that is in a genre all its own (at least it's not oversized insects, deadly flocks of birds, and earthquakes that'll destroy the world).  This is a great mini-series, nearly 5 hours (would be 6 hours if it had all the commercials and such with each episode) and for only $15 it's a steal for such a great series.",5,An Awesome Sci-Fi Series,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,4474,"['Lost', 'Room', 'was', 'miniseries', 'aired', 'December', ""'06"", 'series', 'consisted', 'six', '1-Hour', 'episodes', 'airs', 'three', '2-Hour', 'episodes', 'Key', 'Clock', 'Comb', 'Box', 'Eye', 'Prime', 'Object', 'show', 'mysterious', 'room', 'mysterious', 'even', 'disappeared', 'world', 'born', 'room', '100', 'objects', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'own', 'unique', 'power', 'powers', 'are', 'pretty', 'lame', 'powers', 'are', 'extremely', 'dangerous.Unfortunately', 'one', 'cop', 'Detective', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'Lost', 'Room', 'greatest', 'treasure', 'young', 'daughter', 'finding', 'Key', 'object', 'ability', 'open', 'door', 'take', 'user', 'wherever', 'want', 'as', 'long', 'door', 'encounter', 'man', 'possession', 'Pen', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'daughter', 'up', 'room', 'lost', 'Joe', 'Now', 'Joe', 'must', 'make', 'alliances', 'try', 'find', 'right', 'objects', 'bring', 'daughter', 'back.Now', 'will', 'give', 'quick', 'preview', '3', 'episodes', 'will', 'list', 'objects', 'are', 'seen', 'them.The', 'Key', 'Clock', 'Detective', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'investigating', 'crime', 'scene', 'two', 'men', 'have', 'been', 'burned', 'death', 'sole', 'survivor', 'shop', 'fatally', 'wounded', 'mysterious', 'Key', 'Joe', 'Miller', 'who', 'quickly', 'power', 'key', 'possesses', 'man', 'who', 'murdered', 'two', 'men', 'kidnaps', 'Joe', 'daughter', 'demands', 'Joe', 'trade', 'Key', 'daughter', 'deal', 'bad', 'Joe', 'daughter', 'up', 'lost', 'room', ""n't"", 'only', 'trouble', 'Joe', 'life', 'daughter', 'Joe', 'going', 'divorce', 'custody', 'battle', 'daughter', 'disappears', 'top', 'Joe', 'then', 'blamed', 'murder', 'partner', 'Now', 'Joe', 'must', 'evade', 'capture', 'objects', 'bring', 'daughter', 'back.In', 'episode', 'are', 'introduced', 'Motel', 'Key', 'Bus', 'Ticket', 'Pen', 'Clock', 'Nail', 'File', 'Pencil', 'Watch', 'Radio.The', 'Comb', 'Box', 'Joe', 'police', 'up', 'member', 'mysterious', 'group', 'known', 'Legion', 'who', 'objects', 'room', 'two', 'travel', 'place', 'place', 'learning', 'objects', 'mysterious', 'power', 'real', 'murder', 'Joe', 'partner', 'hunt', 'object', 'will', 'gain', 'membership', 'mysterious', 'group', 'known', 'Order', 'Reunification', 'who', 'believe', 'reuniting', 'objects', 'will', 'allow', 'speak', 'God.In', 'episode', 'are', 'introduced', 'Deck', 'Cards', 'Comb', 'Overcoat', 'Clockbox.The', 'Eye', 'Prime', 'Object', 'Joe', 'now', 'object', 'will', 'bring', 'daughter', 'back', 'Prime', 'Object', 'Now', 'Joe', 'partnered', 'up', 'Karl', 'Kreutzfeld', 'two', 'search', 'vault', 'several', 'valuable', 'items', 'were', 'gathered', 'up', 'first', 'group', 'collect', 'objects', 'known', 'Collectors', 'However', 'Joe', 'new', 'partner', 'pans', 'own', 'Glass', 'Eye', 'object', 'can', 'destroy', 'rebuild', 'flesh', 'alliances', 'must', 'be', 'broken', 'Joe', ""n't"", 'seem', 'agree', 'Kreutzfeld', 'plans', 'Kreutzfeld', 'complete', 'own', 'plans', 'Joe', 'Prime', 'Obeject', 'who', 'also', 'known', 'Occupant', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'Room', '10', 'events', 'caused', 'disappear', 'create', 'objects.In', 'episode', 'are', 'introduced', 'Quarter', 'Scissors', 'Flask', 'Cufflink', 'Glass', 'Eye', 'Portrait', 'Prime', 'Object', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'objects', 'viewed', 'vault', 'most', 'are', 'just', 'quick', 'glances', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'more', 'details', 'giving', 'away', 'most', 'important', 'parts', 'storyline', 'ending', 'will', 'probably', 'upset', 'most', 'least', 'anyone', 'who', 'open', 'endings', 'However', 'minds', 'show', 'are', 'hoping', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'show', 'continuation', 'somewhere', 'road.As', 'show', 'awesome', 'objects', 'actors', 'story', 'great', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'original', 'creations', 'come', 'SciFi', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'story', 'something', 'genre', 'own', 'least', 'not', 'oversized', 'insects', 'deadly', 'flocks', 'birds', ""'ll"", 'destroy', 'world', 'great', 'mini-series', 'nearly', '5', 'hours', 'would', 'be', '6', 'hours', 'had', 'commercials', 'such', 'episode', 'only', '15', 'steal', 'such', 'great', 'series']",The Lost Room

I've read the other reviews and, although most describe the plot, I found the opinion of the DVD itself very informative. This is a really good SciFi drama. A great plot, intelligent script and good acting. Not scary, but interesting. I'd have gone bonkers if I had to wait for weekly installments. The DVD wasn't put together well, buttons don't work as they should and there are previews that lock out the menu, however, the story is worth the electronic inconveniences.

The last two episodes felt rushed, new plot threads were introduced and never resolved, and key questions were never answered.  The ending did not make sense to me at all---it totally violated established rules of the story---and left me feeling as though I had wasted my time.  Such a shame that this great show had to end so poorly.  I would highly recommend this to anyone if it was not for the terrible ending.  As it is, unless you don't mind watching a show with some great ideas that leaves you feeling as though everything is unresolved, then you might still enjoy this.  I don't always expect to agree with an ending, but I certainly do expect for it to make sense and deliver some sort of closure.

Plus, though it says it is widescreen it isn't on disc one yet was on disc two (which didn't have artifacting issues).It's watchable, it just isn't commercial dvd quality.I haven't had any trouble with my ""play all"" selector - it works.While the finale was a little weak, didn't make a lot of sense and felt rushed the trip getting there was fantastic, filled with great suspense and clever solutions that never seemed too contrived.The shows underlying metaphor regarding the corrupting effect of possession of material goods is also rather clever and the sick way some of humanity attributes it's importance as ""Godly"" is also very amusing, if intentional. I don't really think the filmmakers intended such depth, but the plot and story lines lead to those metaphors and it works well.Overall, well worth the new cost and time  - it's a shame this didn't get picked up as a series.
