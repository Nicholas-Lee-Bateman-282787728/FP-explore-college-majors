1172739,AQRPH8IDODK6X,B001BNFR6W,Courtney.,"[5, 5]","Sad. Oh so very sad. I love this show, it is amazing, and when I saw this complete series box set on this website, I was sooo happy! It's so cute! It's a box! Haha. It's colorful, and reallllly nicely packaged (the only reason I gave it 2 stars) but when I put it in my DVD player and realized how much of it wouldn't work (be it episodes or special features) I was so upset. I already had a few of the seasons on DVD, and realized they had some glitches.. I figured they would have redone the discs for this box set, it wouldn't have the same problem, and id have the complete series! So when I had returned it (got a refund, they wont rip you off on that, thankfully)I was so upset. I also hated to see that there were so many customer reviews telling me not to buy this.. why I didnt scroll down and read customer reviews before hand, Ill never know. I also hate to see that this website, as well as others, are still selling it. IT DOESNT WORK. I say take it off store shelves, and take it off websites until they remake the discs to work properly, and rerelease this set. Sucks to.. I loved it.. even made room on my shelf = ( = P.",2,Donttttttt get it!,1301443200,"03 30, 2011",2011,1136,"['Sad', 'Oh', 'so', 'very', 'sad', 'love', 'show', 'amazing', 'when', 'saw', 'complete', 'series', 'box', 'set', 'website', 'was', 'sooo', 'happy', 'so', 'cute', 'box', 'Haha', 'colorful', 'reallllly', 'nicely', 'packaged', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'when', 'put', 'DVD', 'player', 'realized', 'how', 'much', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'be', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'already', 'had', 'few', 'seasons', 'DVD', 'realized', 'had', 'glitches..', 'figured', 'would', 'have', 'redone', 'discs', 'box', 'set', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'problem', 'id', 'have', 'complete', 'series', 'when', 'had', 'returned', 'got', 'refund', 'wont', 'rip', 'off', 'thankfully', 'was', 'so', 'upset', 'also', 'hated', 'see', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'customer', 'reviews', 'telling', 'not', 'buy', 'this..', 'why', 'didnt', 'scroll', 'down', 'read', 'customer', 'reviews', 'hand', 'Ill', 'never', 'know', 'also', 'hate', 'see', 'website', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'are', 'still', 'selling', 'IT', 'DOESNT', 'WORK', 'say', 'take', 'off', 'store', 'shelves', 'take', 'off', 'websites', 'remake', 'discs', 'work', 'properly', 'rerelease', 'set', 'Sucks', 'to..', 'loved', 'it..', 'even', 'made', 'room', 'shelf', '=', '=', 'P']",N/A
