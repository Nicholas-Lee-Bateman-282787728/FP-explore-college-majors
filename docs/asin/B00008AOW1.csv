737599,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B00008AOW1,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[41, 48]","I received this DVD special-ordered through the mail.  I wanted to see some of the documentaries the media doesn't want to show me that address the Bush Administration's ficticious war, which I attended, me being a U.S. soldier, and I was in Iraq for well over a year.  (I have to pay for it myself.)  I already knew I disagreed with the war while I was there, but I always feel ready to consult the media about large social issues such as these.  Of course, just because I felt the war was wrong doesn't lessen my opinion, unless my readers already made up their mind to hate those who want a liberal media, which does not exist.  I call a person like this ""NeoCon"".Some expect that, because I made up my mind, I can no longer ever be objective, but I disagree.  I wanted others' opinions, but I also needed programs such as this one that show certain truths that don't always agree with what that administration wants me to believe.  I am entitled to make up my own mind, form my own opinion, attach myself to whichever group I decide, and progress along my alternative track.  I am allowed to conduct research on my own.  If, during that research, I come upon a question, I have a right to vocalize that query in my own way, whatever way I deem fit and conceiveable to my personal thinking, which is my own and does not pattern after group thought.Noam Chomsky probably feels similar to my description I expect, because, after watching this movie, I sense that this person behind the lectern speaking to the crowd for, what, 50 minutes?, maintained through simple argument, managed to address our government, including Clinton (sorry NeoCons, no ficticious bias for you to place blame to here) and our recent, I guess I could say, infatuations, with what that administration refers to as ""War On Terror"".  This movie intellectually addresses just about the entire scope of that infatuation in broad form, and in such a way that the speaker's credibility backs up the argument.I must confess I'd only heard the name, ""Noam Chomsky"", on the internet, but I didn't know who he was.  Although I read a lot of the internet media, I can't imagine how I didn't know more before receiving the DVD.  When I did receive it, I had no idea what I was in for.  It was some conference room with a lectern in front, and a guy with white hair up there speaking.Amazing how through all the arguing and ranting and Fox Network and CNN and other corporate News programs, and all the newspapers, all the Stars & Stripes newspapers I read while in Iraq, all the internet sites I'd been to and e-mails I received, that addressed all these different and important issues relating to what would turn out to form the opinion I did, how that single video of nothing more than a man in a classroom, I identified with by only listening.  Almost, like I'd been mentally all over the place in limited space and time, a somewhat crazed sense, but that this man spoke to me.  It seemed stronger in comparison to the rest of the noise I hear!  Amazing how some people think they know so much about these political issues, which just seem to rally support for their team, as though it were a soccer game where we are all happy to take sides.  This guy was not offensive in his speech, but his points seemingly poked large gaping holes through those fibers to effectively tell the truth about us humans, especially those in America.  The ""War On Terror"" is a nonsensical war actually landing upon ourselves.  If you quiet down and follow the speech, you might actually learn something, as I did.  A moment of clarity?  The speaker makes an argument I can't deny.  It takes place in a classroom in front of students.  He is probably right, and credibly backs up his thesis.After I finished, I wondered about Chomsky's history, so I checked out his biography on the DVD.  When I did that, I think I must've concluded he must be one of the smartest English-speaking men in the world, not because he had a long list of credits (which helped), but because he said something intelligent and made a relatively undeniable argument about something, and that is all, period.I wish television stations would show documentaries like this one, because they are educational documentaries.  But, in today's #X%&ed-up; American consumer society, we only get popular conviction, and have omitted for us by the corporations for the wealth most proof that American politicians sometimes fail.  Everyone makes mistakes, but Americans have a right to know because this American democratic country belongs to its citizens according to the Constitution and the Declaration Of Independence.  Why do I rarely see journalists actually providing information disemination on the important social issues, and notably the infringements of the government from big business?  Am I not allowed to help decide what kind of government we want?  Aren't we tired of hating houseless people yet?  I am a voter, you know.But, because I'm a soldier who resides in Europe, I actually get the chance to witness another culture, and feel the culture.  So few Americans actually step out of that prided American soil long enough to make a connection to something else; and, doesn't having a non-biased view make for better truth to sample it?  For instance, why do Germans hesitate at violence, but never with putting out magazines on the bottom rack with naked people on the cover, in full view of even children?  To me, this seems the way it should be.  We are taught from birth that self-righteous violence is appropriate for handling situations, like we are afraid of being kind and that kindness is weakness.  Murder and intimidation is good and practical when we Americans do it; we don't let others get away with it, even if it's retaliation for something we did?  Could we be teaching ourselves that emotional closeness and caring feelings are bad for us?  I believe Americans are taught that violence is okay; and, not from videogames, but from the person who has the ability to affect citizens the most: the President Of the United States.  The fact of electing Bush this term, alone, says something about us; do you see?  We live in a land where George Bush gets eight years of political speech, but Michael Moore gets trouble for asking, not forcing, two hours of a movie that no one has to buy a ticket to?  In Germany, the vehicles aren't regulated as much as in America.  You'd think maybe we'd have cleaner air, right??  No.  You know why you cannot see the Hollywood sign in California from the city through the SMOG?  It might be because our American Government deregulates mass corporate air polution; yet, they are more stricter on the regular average population.  They like to enjoy forcing the regulations on average workers than to admit their corporate interest to television news stations.  Preach jail-house rules to the masses, but freedoms to the large corporate businesses, when it comes to the regulations!What good is peace, if by that peace we must be in a constant state of agression?  Can we learn?  If I signed up for eight years in the U.S. Army, can the citizenry of my land I fight for know no peace?  What if the world knows Americans always vote against peace with the Palestinians, yet keep feeding attack helicopters and tanks to their opposition, even when, dare I say, that our friends commit acts of agression against Palestinians that would cause the Palestinians to hate them, and us for helping the terrorist acts of them, and all other countries in the world have deliberately overlooked those acts because it was an American Terror?  What if the world knows we killed people in other countries without excuse, to aflict maximum casualties in public places where our incompetence or else deliberation missed our target?  Are Americans terrorists?  Have Americans committed to acts of war against other countries who were so afraid of us because they knew NATO and the UN would dismiss the thought because it was coming from America?  Watch this DVD.  Of course, as with any true liberal media, we may not be happy with what we hear.  You won't hear it on Fox or CNN.  In fact, will our future hold the kind of honesty in intellectual debate and opinion in this movie?  Intellectual history, not history, but intellectual history, is what you will listen to for the next 50 minutes with this movie, if you care about terrorism as much as I do.",4,Intellectually

He critizies all Americans, not just the &quot;conservatives and liberals&quot;, because he knows that despite these labels, they have most of the same or similar positions.  Call him radical liberal or anti-American, but none of these labels can fit Chomsky.  Call him a distorter and a liar, but truth is he presents all his resources up front (unlike the mass media in America), so that you can interpet it all for yourself.  He never says, &quot;this is the truth, now believe me.&quot;  He says, &quot;here is the truth, its your choice to believe them or not.&quot;  If you have read any of Chomsky's books (not just the ones on politics, but also his ones on language) you'll see that Chomsky is thorough and precise.

He has been known to stir up strong feelings with his outspoken opinions on U.S. foreign and economic policies. In this DVD, Chomsky spends some time talking about the ""war on terror"" and its implications to the United States Government and its people.This DVD consists of one main part and a secondary section with questions and answers (along with some brief bio info on Chomsky). The main part of the DVD features Chomsky giving a speech to a group of students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, at Harvard University. Chomsky voices his opinions on hypocrisy in U.S. foreign policy and the long term effects of fighting a war on terror. In the second part of the film (actually an ""extra"" feature) he provides answers to 17 questions about the war on terror and related topics.In the main part of this DVD, Chomsky talks about the war on terror but he is only minimally effective. First of all, he doesn't really have anything profound to say- at least, nothing that he hasn't said before or that others haven't already stated. In addition to that, he seems a little tired in this part of the presentation. He stammers through some of his words and he seems a little out of focus. And he ends the speech rather weakly. In fact, I was surprised when the end suddenly came because it seemed like it was in the middle of an important thought. I expected more to be said. I don't know if Chomsky was just having a bad day or what, but this part of the DVD doesn't rank among his better efforts.On the other hand, the questions and answers session is much better and it is here that we get to see some vintage Chomsky in action. Some of the seventeen questions he answers include topics like the factor that oil played in the decision to invade Iraq; the Bush pledge to create a Palestinian state; and the importance of pressuring the U.S. to change its agenda with the war on terror. Some of these questions are answered at a press conference; others are answered by Chomsky after he finishes his speech from the first part of the DVD. In these instances, Chomsky is more hard- hitting with his responses and he provides some compelling reasons why the current U.S. foreign policy is wrong and why America should change its course.Overall, this DVD gets an average rating. The speech in the lecture hall isn't very good in presentation or content. But the DVD redeems itself with the seventeen questions and answers. This part of the DVD makes for some thought- provoking debate as Chomsky explains why he feels the U.S. is headed for a train wreck with its current foreign policy regarding terrorism.",3,America's Questionable Foreign Policy,1127692800,"09 26, 2005",2005,2690,"['Noam', 'Chomsky', 'university', 'professor', 'author', 'political/social', 'activist', 'been', 'known', 'stir', 'up', 'strong', 'feelings', 'outspoken', 'opinions', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'economic', 'policies', 'DVD', 'Chomsky', 'time', 'talking', 'war', 'terror', 'implications', 'United', 'States', 'Government', 'people.This', 'DVD', 'one', 'main', 'part', 'secondary', 'section', 'questions', 'answers', 'brief', 'bio', 'info', 'Chomsky', 'main', 'part', 'DVD', 'features', 'Chomsky', 'giving', 'speech', 'group', 'students', 'John', 'F.', 'Kennedy', 'School', 'Government', 'Harvard', 'University', 'Chomsky', 'opinions', 'hypocrisy', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'policy', 'long', 'term', 'effects', 'fighting', 'war', 'terror', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'actually', 'extra', 'feature', 'answers', '17', 'questions', 'war', 'terror', 'related', 'topics.In', 'main', 'part', 'DVD', 'Chomsky', 'war', 'terror', 'only', 'minimally', 'effective', 'First', 'all', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'anything', 'profound', 'say-', 'least', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'said', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'stated', 'addition', 'little', 'tired', 'part', 'presentation', 'words', 'little', 'focus', 'speech', 'rather', 'weakly', 'fact', 'was', 'surprised', 'when', 'end', 'suddenly', 'came', 'seemed', 'was', 'middle', 'important', 'thought', 'expected', 'more', 'be', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chomsky', 'was', 'just', 'having', 'bad', 'day', 'what', 'part', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'rank', 'better', 'efforts.On', 'other', 'hand', 'questions', 'answers', 'session', 'much', 'better', 'here', 'get', 'see', 'vintage', 'Chomsky', 'action', 'seventeen', 'questions', 'include', 'topics', 'factor', 'oil', 'played', 'decision', 'invade', 'Iraq', 'Bush', 'pledge', 'create', 'Palestinian', 'state', 'importance', 'pressuring', 'U.S.', 'change', 'agenda', 'war', 'terror', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'press', 'conference', 'others', 'are', 'answered', 'Chomsky', 'speech', 'first', 'part', 'DVD', 'instances', 'Chomsky', 'more', 'hard-', 'hitting', 'responses', 'compelling', 'reasons', 'why', 'current', 'U.S.', 'foreign', 'policy', 'wrong', 'why', 'America', 'should', 'change', 'course.Overall', 'DVD', 'average', 'rating', 'speech', 'lecture', 'hall', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'presentation', 'content', 'DVD', 'seventeen', 'questions', 'answers', 'part', 'DVD', 'thought-', 'provoking', 'debate', 'Chomsky', 'why', 'U.S.', 'headed', 'train', 'wreck', 'current', 'foreign', 'policy', 'regarding', 'terrorism']",Noam Chomsky - Distorted Morality: America's War on Terror?

737606,A3EQQP0LD4Z375,B00008AOW1,Dr. Lee D. Carlson,"[10, 15]","To make his case that the current efforts cannot be a ""war on terror"", Chomsky asks the viewer to accept three elementary assumptions. The first is that we must bend over backwards to give the benefit of the doubt to the United States government whenever it's possible. The second is to take seriously the pronouncements of leaders. For example, we must believe Bush when he says that he is the most devout Christian since the apostles (did Bush really say this?). The third one concerns the definition of a hypocrite, namely a person who applies to others the standards he refuses to apply to himself. Chomsky then asserts as a thesis that we are all total hypocrites. One need not dig very deep to verify this he says, as proof of it is ""on the surface"". As a second thesis he asserts that the first thesis is so obvious it takes real effort to miss it.Chomsky though makes too general a definition of terrorism, in spite of its coming directly from a 1984 US Army manual. He calls this ""the official US definition of terrorism"", which states that it is the calculated use of violence or threat of violence to attain goals that are political, religious, or ideological in nature. Without knowing for sure if this is indeed the official US definition of terrorism, since US leaders have refrained publicly from stating a definition, it would characterize almost every conflict in history. Unless we are prepared to believe that most wars have been ""terrorist"" acts, this definition must be replaced by one that is more precise. A better definition might be stated as follows:""A terrorist act is one where violence, destruction, and killing are willingly and consciously directed towards civilians in a particular country in order to cripple the will of the populations of that country.""It is the targeting of civilian populations that is the defining characteristic of terrorist acts. This definition is sharper than the one imputed to the US Army by Chomsky. Under it, the use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the fire bombing of Tokyo and Dresden, and the bombing of North Vietnam would all be considered to be terrorist acts. The attack of 9/11 against the World Trade Center would be a terrorist act, but the attack against the Pentagon would not be (since it was directed towards the military). The attacks of the Palestinians against Israeli citizens as well as Israelis against Palestinians are terrorist attacks. The list could go on, with many examples.This definition of terrorism would also encapsulate the ""war against terrorism"" that was supposed to be the focus of US foreign policy in the Reagan administration, and which is discussed a length by Chomsky in this lecture. Chomsky characterizes this era as the era of state sponsored terrorism, and he rightfully chastises George Schultz in his characterization of Central America as being the major source of terrorism, as a ""cancer in our land mass."" The designation of Nicaragua is a major threat to US security was one of the major distortions of the Reagan administration, Chomsky argues.  The Reagan administration condemned outside mediation and any kind of legalistic solutions, using instead mercenary forces based in Honduras under the command of John Negreponte. Chomsky does not discuss any evidence for this claim though.Chomsky concentrates most of his dialog to the ""worse acts of terrorism in Middle East 1985"". These are:1. A car bombing in Beirut, where 80 people were killed, and which was aimed at a Muslim sheik, and organized by CIA and British Intelligence. No evidence of this involvement is offered by Chomsky however.2. The ""Iron Fist"" operation by Shimon Peres, which took place in southern Lebanon, and which targeted terrorist leaders. There was no pretense of self-defense in this operation, argues Chomsky, and he wants to call it ""aggression"" and not terrorism (the 1982 invasion of Lebanon should also be called ""aggression"", rather than terrorism).3. The bombing of Tunis with US cooperation.Chomsky correctly states that violence is not justified in retaliation or pre-emption, that terrorism is not a weapon of the weak, but with all his discussion his main thesis that the ""war against terrorism"" is a ""logical impossibility"" is only given a minute treatment in the lecture unfortunately. However, the lecture does encourage a critical analysis of all the ""written history"" that is currently in print, and also advises the reader, correctly, that whenever you hear something said confidently, you should ask, ""is that really true""? Given the falsehoods proceeding from current political leaders, this is very sound advice.",3,A weaker case than what is usual for Chomsky,1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,4637,"['make', 'case', 'current', 'efforts', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'war', 'terror', 'Chomsky', 'viewer', 'accept', 'three', 'elementary', 'assumptions', 'first', 'must', 'bend', 'backwards', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'whenever', 'possible', 'second', 'take', 'seriously', 'pronouncements', 'leaders', 'example', 'must', 'believe', 'Bush', 'when', 'most', 'devout', 'Christian', 'apostles', 'did', 'Bush', 'really', 'say', 'third', 'one', 'definition', 'hypocrite', 'namely', 'person', 'who', 'others', 'standards', 'apply', 'Chomsky', 'then', 'thesis', 'are', 'total', 'hypocrites', 'One', 'need', 'not', 'dig', 'very', 'deep', 'verify', 'proof', 'surface', 'second', 'thesis', 'first', 'thesis', 'so', 'obvious', 'real', 'effort', 'miss', 'it.Chomsky', 'too', 'general', 'definition', 'terrorism', 'spite', 'coming', 'directly', '1984', 'US', 'Army', 'manual', 'official', 'US', 'definition', 'terrorism', 'calculated', 'use', 'violence', 'threat', 'violence', 'attain', 'goals', 'are', 'political', 'religious', 'ideological', 'nature', 'knowing', 'sure', 'indeed', 'official', 'US', 'definition', 'terrorism', 'US', 'leaders', 'have', 'refrained', 'publicly', 'stating', 'definition', 'would', 'characterize', 'almost', 'conflict', 'history', 'are', 'prepared', 'believe', 'most', 'wars', 'have', 'been', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'definition', 'must', 'be', 'replaced', 'one', 'more', 'precise', 'better', 'definition', 'might', 'be', 'stated', 'A', 'terrorist', 'act', 'one', 'where', 'violence', 'destruction', 'killing', 'are', 'willingly', 'consciously', 'directed', 'towards', 'civilians', 'particular', 'country', 'order', 'cripple', 'will', 'populations', 'country', 'targeting', 'civilian', 'populations', 'defining', 'characteristic', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'definition', 'sharper', 'one', 'imputed', 'US', 'Army', 'Chomsky', 'use', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'Hiroshima', 'Nagasaki', 'fire', 'bombing', 'Tokyo', 'Dresden', 'bombing', 'North', 'Vietnam', 'would', 'all', 'be', 'considered', 'be', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'attack', '9/11', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'would', 'be', 'terrorist', 'act', 'attack', 'Pentagon', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'was', 'directed', 'military', 'attacks', 'Palestinians', 'Israeli', 'citizens', 'as', 'well', 'Israelis', 'Palestinians', 'are', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'list', 'could', 'go', 'many', 'examples.This', 'definition', 'terrorism', 'would', 'also', 'encapsulate', 'war', 'terrorism', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'focus', 'US', 'foreign', 'policy', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'discussed', 'length', 'Chomsky', 'lecture', 'Chomsky', 'era', 'era', 'state', 'sponsored', 'terrorism', 'rightfully', 'George', 'Schultz', 'characterization', 'Central', 'America', 'being', 'major', 'source', 'terrorism', 'cancer', 'land', 'mass', 'designation', 'Nicaragua', 'major', 'threat', 'US', 'security', 'was', 'one', 'major', 'distortions', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'Chomsky', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'condemned', 'outside', 'mediation', 'kind', 'legalistic', 'solutions', 'using', 'instead', 'mercenary', 'forces', 'based', 'Honduras', 'command', 'John', 'Negreponte', 'Chomsky', 'not', 'discuss', 'evidence', 'claim', 'though.Chomsky', 'most', 'dialog', 'worse', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'Middle', 'East', '1985', 'are:1', 'car', 'bombing', 'Beirut', 'where', '80', 'people', 'were', 'killed', 'was', 'aimed', 'Muslim', 'sheik', 'organized', 'CIA', 'British', 'Intelligence', 'evidence', 'involvement', 'offered', 'Chomsky', 'however.2', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'operation', 'Shimon', 'Peres', 'took', 'place', 'southern', 'Lebanon', 'targeted', 'terrorist', 'leaders', 'was', 'pretense', 'self-defense', 'operation', 'Chomsky', 'call', 'aggression', 'not', 'terrorism', '1982', 'invasion', 'Lebanon', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'called', 'aggression', 'rather', 'terrorism', '.3', 'bombing', 'Tunis', 'US', 'cooperation.Chomsky', 'correctly', 'violence', 'not', 'justified', 'retaliation', 'pre-emption', 'terrorism', 'not', 'weapon', 'weak', 'discussion', 'main', 'thesis', 'war', 'terrorism', 'logical', 'impossibility', 'only', 'given', 'minute', 'treatment', 'lecture', 'unfortunately', 'However', 'lecture', 'encourage', 'critical', 'analysis', 'written', 'history', 'currently', 'print', 'also', 'reader', 'correctly', 'whenever', 'hear', 'something', 'said', 'confidently', 'should', 'ask', 'really', 'true', 'Given', 'falsehoods', 'proceeding', 'current', 'political', 'leaders', 'very', 'sound', 'advice']",Noam Chomsky - Distorted Morality: America's War on Terror?
737607,A18CA0GRHDVP8X,B00008AOW1,Earl Hazell,"[250, 280]","Noam Chomsky is one of the most important living Americans, if for no other reason that the media and the intellectual public's total refusal to engage him in debate on any of the issues he brings up make it clear how fragile our democracy has once again become. Better to silence, ridicule him and question his patriotism than to deal with the factual nature of what he brings to light? In a dictatorship maybe!This DVD is actually my introduction to him, regarding hearing him speak. Without going too far in the direction of being too linguistically intellectual, or too far in the other of being self-righteously rhetorical, Chomsky proves for any person willing to think (and not just feel emotions the corporate media has expressly designed to make us feel) that a war on terror could not possibly exist. He brings to light foreign policy facts that show Terrorism as a modern political tool of ALL nations today, with smaller nations and dictatorships having in actuality less effect on the world stage with terrorism (despite the press they receive in developed countries leading one to believe otherwise) than the far more deadly and effective examples of terrorism practiced by, well, us. Chomsky, in his intellectual but raw, Sagittarian tell-it like-it-is way, does not demand anti-Americanism, or an insurrection, or even civil disobedience with this lecture to Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. His spelling out of not just facts of the structure of language, but facts of current events and recent history reveals the moral vacuum in our present day world; a vacuum that, just like nature's abhorrence of a true vacuum, is abhored by the hearts of good people from whom true knowledge and information has been kept--which is most of America and the world.  A vacuum that can only be filled with a sober, rational, moral maturity, when it comes to political perspectives, foreign policy and the secret motivational impulses and agendas of our quasi-democratic nations.This DVD comes with subtitles, despite the fact that he is speaking in English. This can be distracting at times, because they are not 100% accurate regarding actual words spoken nor the spontaneity with which Chomsky, like with any speaker, uses one word or phrase incorrectly and then corrects himself while in the middle of another sentence. A helpful section is where the question and answer session after the lecture is broken up into sections on the DVD, just like various scenes on a movie--though here again, I would have preferred to be able to simply run the entire thing and here the questions as they were being asked. Just the same, these small issues of DVD construction will not take away from the power of Chomsky's message, or his presence.It is really odd: Einstein's political views were extraordinarily progressive and gave most believers in a capitalist democracy, as well as communists, a moment of pause whenever he publicly shared them to say the least. But he was not silenced for these views, even back in the 40's and 50's; he was even asked to be the Prime Minister of the State of Israel by the Israelis. He was Einstein! Noam Chomsky has had the well deserved title of being the Einstein of the science of Linguistics practically since the late 50's--a title not even given to Nietzsche, a professor of linguistics (then called philology) while he was writing his philosophy... and yet here, in the 21st century, his so-called political views (as opposed to what they really are: again, moral perspectives) make it impossible for him to ever be seen or read on 60 minutes?

I decided to buy this DVD on a whim because of the eloquent review below by Arthur Blenheim.  Mr. Chomsky gives an excellent 50 minute speech on how we are all hypocritical, not ""America"" as a separate entity but we the people who do not take part in our democracy. Chomsky details case after case of where the U.S. has engaged in terrorism but it wasn't even a blip on the radar screen of our media.  One thing he mentioned which was very impressive was when he talked about how the U.S. told the Taliban about how we will attack them if they don't hand over Osama Bin Laden.  And the Taliban stated, first give us evidence, and we will hand him over to a third party.  Now when 9/11 happened and I read that the Taliban wanted evidence, the first thing I thought was what??? Those guys want evidence? Everyone knows Osama did it.  But we have to realize that the Taliban don't want to be blown to smitherins. Their request for evidence not that outlandish. Before you attack another country, you should have negotiations which we did not do.  In addition, we killed, starved, maimed or left thousands more Afghans homeless than actually helping them.  Chomsky also talks about Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Now Saudi Arabia has had 1,000 beheadings in the last 20 years, they practice Wahhabism, which is the strictest form of Islam. And the women over there hardly have any rights (read ""Princess"" by Jean Sassoon or ""My Life in Saudi Arabia"" by Carmen Bin Laden).  But why have we supported Saudi Arabia since its inception? Because they have 40% of the world's oil and we sure as heck don't want anyone else getting their hands on it (speaking from point of view of the government).After the 50-minute speech, there is a lively question and answer session.  Chomsky seems like an extremely intelligent and articulate man. He states over and over - guys this information is not hidden, you can learn all of this with a few clicks of your mouse.

Chomsky, if you aren't familiar with him, is a linguistics professor at MIT who sidelines as a critic of American foreign policy. He's considered one of the brightest linguistic theorists in the world, a man who formulated a theory about language several decades ago that's still talked about today. It's sad to say, but the general public probably won't remember him for his scholarly work. Chomsky has written dozens of books about the scurrilous behavior of our elected officials and their actions taken against foreign nations, from the Vietnam War to activities in East Timor to the current war on terrorism. He attacks the media for serving as an instrument of American hegemony. One day, Chomsky hopes to replace capitalism with a system of government referred to as anarcho-syndicalism. He also unwaveringly supports the United Nations and the World Court, hoping that the United States will toss its sovereignty aside and merge with those two international bodies. I didn't get all of this detail from &quot;Distorted Morality,&quot; but from another, longer DVD about Chomsky's background and intellectual underpinnings called &quot;Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media.&quot;Chomsky's lecture at Harvard-which he calls a &quot;talk&quot; because it sounds more informal-deals with the Bush administration's efforts to combat international terrorism. Beginning with a premise about terrorism taken from an old American military handbook, he attempts to prove that a war on terrorism is an impossibility, an illogical idea completely inconsistent with our nation's prior actions in Central America and the Middle East. The United States consistently supports and works closely with terroristic regimes, argues the professor, which means that we are in fact and in action a terroristic regime. A war on terrorism, therefore, would mean that we must fight ourselves. Chomsky doesn't go so far as to condone the September 11, 2001 nightmare; he accepts that it is a horrific incident worthy of retaliation, but he wants the United States to do so through the umbrella of the United Nations and the World Court. The lecture only runs for an hour or so. The question and answer session at MIT covers a whole host of foreign policy issues-guerilla warfare, 9/11-with some of the answers from Chomsky varying from a few sentences to five minutes or more.Noam Chomsky is an acquired taste. While I disagree strenuously with him concerning American involvement in the UN and the World Court, I usually agree with many of the issues he raises about our foreign relations. I'm more at home with him when he attacks the concentrated media systems in the United States and calls for a breakup of the big corporations that control what we see and hear. Critics routinely blast Chomsky by labeling him as either pro-communist or a literal communist. Well, he's not, but tossing a label like this one around obscures many of the pertinent issues he raises. America has acted to support tyrants in the past. American companies have exploited third world countries and citizens of those countries (Nike and the United Fruit Company, anyone?). A nation cannot indulge in exploitative practices for decades and expect there won't be reprisals.Here's a good question that Chomsky would probably love-and one that ties into the lecture he gives on this disc: why, when we expelled the Taliban from Afghanistan and still have troops on the ground over there, are the poppy fields pumping out raw opium as never before? The heroin derived from those fields ends up in the United States, does it not? Why don't we stop it? Perhaps the government wants a certain segment of the American population to use narcotics because it's easier to control a docile citizenry. Too, it allows the federal government to continue to wage yet another one of their great wars, the ever reliable &quot;War on Drugs.&quot; I just can't believe our government didn't shut down those poppy fields. Doing so could save thousands, if not tens of thousands, of our citizens from a life of addiction, despair, and death. While you don't hear the media raising issues such as this one, you will here people like Noam Chomsky asking about it. For that, I do respect his insights and ability to increase awareness.&quot;Distorted Morality&quot; isn't the best available information on Chomsky floating around. In fact, I found the lecture and Q&amp;A on this disc a little dry. I keep planning on checking out a few of his books so I can get a better take on the man. While I find some of his solutions to our problems unacceptable, the questions he asks and the issues he raises continue to challenge what our government is doing and the reasons behind it.",4,"Dry,

He is even kind enough to tell us why: Because, as a citizen of the USA, it is simply more sensible, efficient and responsible for him to focus his efforts there. As a voter and a public personality, he can make a difference in the US, much more so than in other countries. He believes, in short, that criticism, like charity, begins at home. In no way does he excuse the oppressive governments of other countries. He does force the realization, however, that we simply DO NOT KNOW if those governments would have ended up being oppressive in the absence of American foreign policy atrocities, because, in fact, many of them were never given the chance.At the very least, Chomsky's work can help us to &quot;de-brainwash&quot; ourselves. We may not end up agreeing with him (I disagree with his viewpoint on the Second Amendment, for example), but at least we will be thinking 'outside the box', for a short time, anyway.

737614,A11ED8O95W2103,B00008AOW1,"lighten_up_already2 ""lighten_up_already2""","[2, 14]","First of all, I obtained this DVD as part of a good faith effort to understand exactly who Noam Chomsky is and what he stands for.  I genuinely tried to put any preconceived notions ""on hold"" and, to paraphrase Chomsky, ""bend over backwards"" to give him the benefit of the doubt.Now, this DVD is basically a one-camera tape of a lecture by Noam Chomsky, so all I really have available to review is the content of the lecture.What I heard was to me a case study in how to indoctrinate people who may be very bright but have not yet developed critical thinking skills.Here's how it goes.First, a healthy dose of false guilt to make the audience feel morally superior.  ""We are all hypocrites...""  Why?  Because we have a lot of resources and can find out the truth if we want to.  (Noam Chomsky graciously includes himself as this kind of ""hypocrite"" too.  Quite ironic given the way this lecture developed: many accusations with little background information.)(Now, can I really find the truth if I want to?  How do I do that exactly?  By listening to the media?  Chomsky has already proven that this doesn't work.  All the media does is manufacture consent, right?  By listening to Noam Chomsky lectures?  Hmmmmm.  How do I find out the truth if I want to again?  Should I call the CIA and ask to look at top secret stuff just becuase I want to ""find the truth""?  Or, maybe just read dozens of blogs every day.  That'll do the trick!)Second, Chomsky decided to ""take leadership pronouncements seriously"".  This means he can cherry pick a definition of terrorism -- ""The calculated use violence to obtain goals that are political, ideological, or religious in nature."" -- that fits his ideological objective to morally equivocate the violence of the United States and Israel with the violence of the enemies of the US and Israel.So, now the stage is set, and what I end up hearing is Chomsky mumbling his way through a list of accusations against the US and Israel (much centering on the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the early 1980's) with no background information at all to put things into perspective.  (Except, of course, the occational reference to The New York Times which of course settles all argument.  If the NYT says it, it's true and that's all there is to it.)Having already read ""Because They Hate: A Survivor of Islamic Terror Warns America by Brigitte Gabriel"" I know there's another point of view on the events in Lebanon during that time period, but Chomsky isn't about multiple points of view, he's about moral equivalence.So, without regurgitating this entire lecture point by point, I'll end with the following observations.First, Chomsky opens his lecture by saying he's going to ""bend over backwards"" to give the US the benefit of the doubt.  This seems like just a rhetorical divice to disarm the listener in preperation for Chomsky's bending over backwards to make the US and Israel out to be terrorist sponsoring states.  Chomsky actually did the opposite of what he said he would do.Second, the talent Noam Chomsky demonstrated in this lecture seems to be the ability to get bright, affluent college students to feel smart and morally superior without really teaching them anything whatsoever.Certainly, it takes a really really ""good"" education to miss this.",3,A case study in how to indoctrinate college students.,1190332800,"09 21, 2007",2007,3287,"['First', 'obtained', 'DVD', 'part', 'good', 'faith', 'effort', 'understand', 'exactly', 'who', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'what', 'genuinely', 'tried', 'put', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'hold', 'paraphrase', 'Chomsky', 'bend', 'backwards', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt.Now', 'DVD', 'basically', 'one-camera', 'tape', 'lecture', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'really', 'have', 'available', 'review', 'content', 'lecture.What', 'heard', 'was', 'case', 'study', 'how', 'indoctrinate', 'people', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'very', 'bright', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'developed', 'critical', 'thinking', 'how', 'goes.First', 'healthy', 'dose', 'false', 'guilt', 'make', 'audience', 'feel', 'morally', 'superior', 'are', 'hypocrites', 'Why', 'have', 'lot', 'resources', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'want', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'graciously', 'kind', 'hypocrite', 'too', 'Quite', 'ironic', 'given', 'way', 'lecture', 'developed', 'many', 'accusations', 'little', 'background', 'information', 'Now', 'can', 'really', 'find', 'truth', 'want', 'How', 'do', 'do', 'exactly', 'listening', 'media', 'Chomsky', 'already', 'proven', ""n't"", 'work', 'media', 'manufacture', 'consent', 'right', 'listening', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'Hmmmmm', 'How', 'do', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'want', 'again', 'Should', 'call', 'CIA', 'ask', 'look', 'top', 'secret', 'stuff', 'just', 'becuase', 'want', 'find', 'truth', 'maybe', 'just', 'read', 'dozens', 'blogs', 'day', ""'ll"", 'do', 'trick', 'Second', 'Chomsky', 'decided', 'take', 'leadership', 'pronouncements', 'seriously', 'can', 'cherry', 'pick', 'definition', 'terrorism', 'calculated', 'use', 'violence', 'obtain', 'goals', 'are', 'political', 'ideological', 'religious', 'nature', 'ideological', 'objective', 'morally', 'equivocate', 'violence', 'United', 'States', 'Israel', 'violence', 'enemies', 'US', 'Israel.So', 'now', 'stage', 'set', 'what', 'end', 'up', 'hearing', 'Chomsky', 'mumbling', 'way', 'list', 'accusations', 'US', 'Israel', 'much', 'centering', 'Israeli', 'invasion', 'Lebanon', 'early', '1980', 'background', 'information', 'put', 'things', 'perspective', 'course', 'occational', 'reference', 'New', 'York', 'Times', 'course', 'settles', 'argument', 'NYT', 'true', 'Having', 'already', 'read', 'Hate', 'Survivor', 'Islamic', 'Terror', 'Warns', 'America', 'Brigitte', 'Gabriel', 'know', 'point', 'view', 'events', 'Lebanon', 'time', 'period', 'Chomsky', ""n't"", 'about', 'multiple', 'points', 'view', 'moral', 'equivalence.So', 'regurgitating', 'entire', 'lecture', 'point', 'point', ""'ll"", 'end', 'following', 'observations.First', 'Chomsky', 'lecture', 'saying', 'going', 'bend', 'backwards', 'give', 'US', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'like', 'just', 'rhetorical', 'divice', 'disarm', 'listener', 'preperation', 'Chomsky', 'bending', 'backwards', 'make', 'US', 'Israel', 'be', 'terrorist', 'sponsoring', 'states', 'Chomsky', 'actually', 'did', 'opposite', 'what', 'said', 'would', 'do.Second', 'talent', 'Noam', 'Chomsky', 'demonstrated', 'lecture', 'be', 'ability', 'get', 'bright', 'affluent', 'college', 'students', 'feel', 'smart', 'morally', 'superior', 'really', 'teaching', 'anything', 'whatsoever.Certainly', 'really', 'really', 'good', 'education', 'miss']",Noam Chomsky - Distorted Morality: America's War on Terror?
737615,A3SF2N0BJF0YJS,B00008AOW1,N. Caine,"[13, 15]","The heart of Chomsky's pioneering social criticism is his critique of mainstream media as caught in a web of inanity and sensationalism tied to a kind of obsequious nudge-nudge-wink-wink with the seats of power:  government, corporate, and Vox Populi.  His decades of specific social and political work are, in many ways, just a simple reading of stories and facts that are never reported in mainstream media, whether environmental impact of government deregulation, U.S.-approved terror campaigns in places like East Timor and Nicaragua, and so on.  While critics have tried to paint him as a kind of conspiracy theoriest, each passing year of having corporate lobbyists write legislation makes Chomsky look almost laughably common-sensical, like, ""Oh, of course, tell me something I don't know.""  At the same time, his specifics of how our beloved country is complicit in human rights violations, while common sense, make one awfully uncomfortable.This uncomfortability, plus Chomsky's self-confessed refusal to speak in sound-bytes which are the only currency of the media, combine to marginalize him more than any of his critics' arguments.  These two elements are also why the lectures of ""Distorted Morality"" are particularly uninspiring, and in my opinion, some of his less effective work.  The Harvard lecture is Chomsky at his most slow and repetitive.  He essentially argues using a number of examples that the U.S. government has used assassination and civilian-targeted terror campaigns in other countries for years, either on our own (through the CIA especially), or through our support of Israel.  These are, he argues, either war crimes (targetting civilians during war), or, if there is no war, then terrorist acts.  The war on terror, therefore, is a new and dangerous way our government has to reframe any act of our own power (whether through Guantanamo, the Patriot Act, support for more covert terror, etc.) as self-defense.I don't have a lot to argue with that, but I don't find it nearly as revelatory or helpful to know as I do, say, just about EVERY page of the book, ""Understanding Power:  The Indispensible Chomsky"" or, of course, the dvd of ""Manufacturing Consent.""  In fact, the Harvard lecture is pretty dull, and he doesn't use any of his time to present Israel's point of view, even though most of his examples are of Israeli acts.  He would have bolstered and enhanced the lecture by considering the best case argument from the Israeli side, and then critiquing it.If you have seen other Chomsky and want to hear what he has to say about this issue, by all means he's always worth hearing!
