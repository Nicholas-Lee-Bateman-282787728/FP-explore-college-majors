1206613,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B001JP64YG,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[1, 1]","Disclaimer: The version of this film that I watched was included in theMidnight Mysteries Collectionand, as such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this Synergy Ent. release.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.WOMAN ON THE RUN isn't likely to round out anyone's top 25 or even top 50 list of film noirs, though that doesn't mean fans of the genre need to skip over it.  Actually, considering the field is rather narrow, and they sure aren't making them like they used to, I'd say that this Anne Sheridan vehicle is certainly worth the effort of tracking down, and may even pleasantly surprise long-time card-carrying members of the Sam Spade club.What I enjoyed most about the film was its secondary themes, which, while not exactly subtle, were deftly woven into the suspense of the plot's focus.  Eleanor Johnson (Sheridan) is trying to help her husband the best she knows how, despite their fragmenting marriage.  When he becomes witness to a murder and goes into hiding, she thwarts attempts by the police to find him and compel him to testify - which lately has become quite injurious to one's health.  The trouble is, he's hidden himself so well that she also has to hunt for him, aided by the slight clues he's given her and acompanied by a nosy newspaper man who's hungry for an exclusive.  But her manhunt turns up more than just her husband's cold trail - through the eyes of his friends and associates she glimpses the man she married rather than the man she'd become married to.  But can she find him and express her new-found emotion before the killer expresses his?As I said, not exactly subtle, but yet perhaps a trifle more emotional depth than some other noirs I've seen.  LikeThe Postman Always Rings Twice, this is another of its type to poke around the edges of the dynamics between men and women and their sometimes tense, uneasy relationships.  However, I also think the film has several weak spots, most notably the budget.  Almost all of the outside scenes are shot in a studio, with stock film running in the background, and this became almost a distraction, which is unusual for me, as I make great allowances for techniques commmensurate with the time.  I suspect one of the reason it stands out so much this time is that there is truly a unique finale here, as Ms. Sheridan is trapped on a roller coaster ride while her husband is being stalked by the killer.  With the dramatic interplay of light and shadow and the crosshatching of the coaster's framework resemblingCaligari-style expressionism, the film, I think, could have been a classic.  As it is, the studio techniques cheapen the overall effect.Another problem I thought was the supporting cast, which were a bit on the abrasive side, especially Robert Keith (father of Brian) as the police inspector assigned to the case.  Even Ms. Sheridan seems a little uneven, though in fairness, the role does require her to go from uncaring, caustic wife to falling in love again.  All told, I'm left feeling the film could have been much more, yet just missed.Great 1950's line - when the police inspector asks Ms. Sheridan why she didn't  get a job if she was so unhappy with her marriage, she replies, 'Why should I?  That's his responsibility'.  Oh, for the good ol' days.This edition of the film, included in the Midnight Mysteries Collection, was entirely satisfactory for me, even if I were to watch it again someday.  Plenty of artifacts, yet the action was never obscured during the nighttime scenes, and even with a couple instances of audio drop, the rest of the dialog was clear and understandable.  Presented in 4 x 3, it seems well worth the cost-averaged price compared to the individual release.  No subtitles, no special features other than a short photo gallery of lobby cards.",3,"3 1/2 Stars - Keep your friends close, and your enemy's wife closer",1347494400,"09 13, 2012",2012,3815,"['Disclaimer', 'version', 'film', 'watched', 'was', 'included', 'theMidnight', 'Mysteries', 'Collectionand', 'such', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'Synergy', 'Ent', 'release', 'review', 'entertainment', 'value', 'film', 'only.WOMAN', 'ON', 'THE', 'RUN', ""n't"", 'likely', 'round', 'out', 'anyone', 'top', '25', 'even', 'top', '50', 'list', 'film', 'noirs', ""n't"", 'mean', 'fans', 'genre', 'need', 'skip', 'Actually', 'considering', 'field', 'rather', 'narrow', 'sure', 'are', ""n't"", 'making', 'used', ""'d"", 'say', 'Anne', 'Sheridan', 'vehicle', 'certainly', 'worth', 'effort', 'tracking', 'down', 'may', 'even', 'pleasantly', 'surprise', 'long-time', 'card-carrying', 'members', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'club.What', 'enjoyed', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'secondary', 'themes', 'not', 'exactly', 'subtle', 'were', 'deftly', 'woven', 'suspense', 'plot', 'focus', 'Eleanor', 'Johnson', 'Sheridan', 'trying', 'help', 'husband', 'best', 'how', 'fragmenting', 'marriage', 'When', 'witness', 'murder', 'hiding', 'attempts', 'police', 'find', 'compel', 'testify', 'lately', 'become', 'quite', 'injurious', 'one', 'health', 'trouble', 'hidden', 'so', 'well', 'also', 'hunt', 'aided', 'slight', 'clues', 'given', 'acompanied', 'nosy', 'newspaper', 'man', 'who', 'hungry', 'exclusive', 'manhunt', 'up', 'more', 'just', 'husband', 'cold', 'trail', 'eyes', 'friends', 'man', 'married', 'rather', 'man', ""'d"", 'become', 'married', 'can', 'find', 'express', 'new-found', 'emotion', 'killer', 'said', 'not', 'exactly', 'subtle', 'yet', 'perhaps', 'trifle', 'more', 'emotional', 'depth', 'other', 'noirs', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'LikeThe', 'Postman', 'Always', 'Rings', 'Twice', 'type', 'poke', 'edges', 'dynamics', 'men', 'women', 'sometimes', 'tense', 'uneasy', 'relationships', 'However', 'also', 'think', 'film', 'several', 'weak', 'spots', 'most', 'notably', 'budget', 'Almost', 'outside', 'scenes', 'are', 'shot', 'studio', 'stock', 'film', 'running', 'background', 'became', 'almost', 'distraction', 'unusual', 'make', 'great', 'allowances', 'techniques', 'commmensurate', 'time', 'suspect', 'one', 'reason', 'out', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'truly', 'unique', 'finale', 'here', 'Ms.', 'Sheridan', 'trapped', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'husband', 'being', 'stalked', 'killer', 'dramatic', 'interplay', 'light', 'shadow', 'crosshatching', 'coaster', 'framework', 'resemblingCaligari-style', 'expressionism', 'film', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'classic', 'studio', 'techniques', 'cheapen', 'overall', 'effect.Another', 'problem', 'thought', 'was', 'supporting', 'cast', 'were', 'bit', 'abrasive', 'side', 'especially', 'Robert', 'Keith', 'father', 'Brian', 'police', 'inspector', 'assigned', 'case', 'Even', 'Ms.', 'Sheridan', 'little', 'uneven', 'though', 'fairness', 'role', 'require', 'go', 'uncaring', 'caustic', 'wife', 'falling', 'love', 'again', 'told', ""'m"", 'left', 'feeling', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'yet', 'just', 'missed.Great', '1950', 'line', 'when', 'police', 'inspector', 'Ms.', 'Sheridan', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'job', 'was', 'so', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'should', 'responsibility', 'Oh', 'good', 'ol', 'days.This', 'edition', 'film', 'included', 'Midnight', 'Mysteries', 'Collection', 'was', 'entirely', 'satisfactory', 'even', 'were', 'watch', 'again', 'someday', 'Plenty', 'artifacts', 'yet', 'action', 'was', 'never', 'obscured', 'nighttime', 'scenes', 'even', 'couple', 'instances', 'audio', 'drop', 'rest', 'dialog', 'was', 'clear', 'understandable', 'Presented', '4', 'x', '3', 'well', 'cost-averaged', 'price', 'compared', 'individual', 'release', 'subtitles', 'special', 'other', 'short', 'photo', 'gallery', 'lobby', 'cards']",N/A
1206614,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B001JP64YG,C. O. DeRiemer,"[11, 12]","What a pleasure it is to come across an old suspense noir you've either forgotten about or never heard of and discover it's a solid and engrossing movie. Woman on the Run, starring Ann Sheridan and Dennis O'Keefe, is that movie. It's the story of a man out walking his dog one night in San Francisco who witnesses a mob-related killing...and realizes the killer saw him. The cops plan to take him into protective custody but he doesn't trust them to keep him alive. He has another idea. He disappears. And when the cops visit the man's wife, they discover a woman who seems not to care one way or the other. Her marriage has been on the skids for quite awhile. She won't hinder; she won't help. She just wants out. But as she learns more about her husband, she decides he at least needs a fair chance. So before long she starts looking for the guy. And so are the cops. And so is a newspaper reporter after a scoop. And so is the killer. But no one knows where he's hiding. She decides to team up with the reporter to beat the cops and the killer to her husband. When half way through the movie we realize what's going on, and she doesn't, the tension escalates briskly. It all comes together in a beach-front amusement park at night. It may be 1950 and there's no neon, but there's lots of lights, a giggling, life-size mechanical clown, cotton candy stands, a movie house playing The Big Lift, a boardwalk filled with laughing people, pitch black shadows under the piers and the roller-coaster from hell. Woman on the Run was an indie picture. No one would confuse it with an A movie from one the crumbling major studios, but it's way above a B programmer. I'd match the last 17 minutes in the amusement park against any film.The script is tight and the direction is more than efficient; it builds tension while encouraging us to become emotionally involved with the two leads. It uses little touches to let us get to know the characters. The drink of choice of Eleanor Johnson, the wife, is gin on the rocks. She's no lush, just a confident woman who likes gin. The drink of choice for Danny Leggett, the reporter, is an Old Fashioned (""but hold the garbage""). I'm not sure what this tells us about the two, but it's a nice switch from the usual drinks clich&eacute;s.Ann Sheridan plays Eleanor Johnson with sympathy. Sheridan, at 35, is no longer one of the great girly pin-ups of WWII. Her career was starting on the downward slope as newer pretty faces emerged. Sheridan was one of the few star actresses, in my opinion, who combined sexuality with wry intelligence. Carole Lombard, Myrna Loy and Joan Bennett also had that gift. She also was a good actress. She knew how effective underplaying could be. When she's on the roller-coaster, realizes who the killer is and tries to warn her husband, who she can see below her while the killer approaches him, is a nifty acting job that involves, well, restrained screaming. We know Sheridan's character does not enjoy the roller-coaster ride, but Sheridan does not play the damsel-in-distress bit. Her screaming is directed to her husband, trying to get his attention. But she also has to deal with those fast down slopes that turn most peoples' stomachs. She handles it like a pro. Dennis O'Keefe as Danny Leggett (""Leggett of the Graphic"") was also starting the slide down into television. He's not all that appreciated now, or even remembered, but O'Keefe was a versatile and effective lead actor. ""I'm not a bad guy when you get to know me,"" Leggett tells Eleanor, ""a little obnoxious, but pleasant."" It's more than pleasant to see how these two actors and the characters they play deal with each other.",4,"""I'm not a bad guy when you get to know me...a little obnoxious, but pleasant.""
