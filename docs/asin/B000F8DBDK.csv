It is a film that tells a story that deserved to be told. The man with a dream and the sheer cussedness and ingenuity to make it happen. A morality tale about having a dream and putting it together with what is available. It crackles with good story lines, characters and the motorbike. You don't have to be a motorbike freak to enjoy this because it is more about decency, self-sufficiency and resilience. Of course it helped that the man was a back shed genius. What told me this movie was good was showing it to an oldie who loved and raced old bikes. He roared over the pistons made from old tin cans, setting the lawn on fire and the sheer self sufficiency/invention of Bert Munro's world.

Youth culture abounded back then, so it is even more amazing that New Zealander, Burt (Anthony Hopkins) came upon the racing scene back then.  He's eccentric, even in his own country, so when he is bound and determined to go to America to enter a high speed racing contest at the Bonneville Race Track on the salt tracks in Utah, he really seems alien.  At home his neighbor George tells him that his lawn upkeep is ruining property values, so Burt sets fire to his own grass.  In America he is set in his ways, so everything from driving on the right side of the street to U.S. currency is a real adjustment.  Like many movies with alien elements ('Starman,' 'Moscow on the Hudson,' and, even 'Borat') the peculiarities come out in the contrast.  Some of the comparisons are on us.  Few are kinder than the Hollywood transvestive at the local motel.  Burt's philosophy is ""Once you're dead, you're dead,"" a carpe diem theme that he lives up to.  In the same vein he says, ""Some people can curl up in a corner and die,"" something he refuses to do--even when taking his ""nitro glycerine"" heart medicine.  When he enters the contest with his ancient ""Indian"" motorcycle, he pretty much will live on his own terms or die trying.  There are many hurdles he must face at registration and customs for all his dated unorthodoxy, but, once given a chance, his determination impresses everyone, even the tight officials.'The World's Fastest Indian' is a colorful and fun-filled ride with a lovable hero and interesting characters to be found along the way.

The movie features one of Hopkin's all time great performances. One can only wonder why the Academy overlooked this small gem of a movie when it was released in theatres.Although only occasionally trite - which may be a bit much for some viewers - there is a real nail-biting suspense as we witness the eccentric New Zealander Burt Munro (Hopkins) travel to America with his soaped up 1920's Indian motorcycle in the hopes of breaking the world's land-speed record in 1967 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in UtahThe movie is great entertainment, beautifully directed by Roger Donaldson and features Mr. Hopkins in an endearingly gruff and off-kilter performance that is sure to win both hearts and minds. Bert is determined not to let his infirmities deter him from achieving his dreams - he has a bad ""ticker"" and prostate problems - and he lives in the pretty isolated southern New Zealand town of Invercargil.Bert's a crusty old guy with a big dream, endlessly tinkering in the garage of his eyesore of a home and drinking tea with an adoring young neighbor (a very cute Aaron Murphy). He's obsessed and absentminded and his neighbours are exasperated by his unmowed lawn and all the early morning hammering, but there's something magical about him too, and when he sets out on his journey, working his passage in a steamer, he ends up getting a teary send-off.Armed only with naivet&eacute; and good-natured optimism, he meets a variety of eccentric characters along the way - including a kindly drag queen, a latino used car salesman, a lonely lady who invites him into her bed, a fresh-faced soldier on leave from Vietnam and a real live Indian who helps Bert out on the road and gives him a natural remedy for his prostate problems. There's something to be said for this charming senior - and enthusiastic lover - who overcomes one obstacle after another to go an impossible distance.Upon reaching the Utah racing ground, Burt is faced with seemingly intractable obstacles. It looks as though bureaucracy is going to get the better of him - the official registration date was months earlier, and his motorcycle has none of the required safety features. But with the help of Jim Moffet (Chris Lawford), a gracious and kindly biker who's on good terms with the officials, the rules are bent, and Burt is allowed to race.Donaldson directs this ironic, inspirational allegory without a single gimmicky, phony or contrived moment and the 60's period recreation is beautifully done. Hopkins is all-natural, really nailing the New Zealand accent - and in the process proves that it's all about watching the joy of a man who has nothing left to prove.It's a charismatic and entirely internalized performance that sneaks up on you to deliver an enriching life lesson, that it's important to live life to the fullest and to follow your dreams.

It's ""The World's Fastest Indian,"" starring Anthony Hopkins in the true story about Burt Munro, a 60-ish man from New Zealand who owns a 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle, and, in the mid-1960's, travels to America with his Indian to fulfill his lifelong dream of setting a landspeed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. The odds are against Burt every step of the way, as he has very little money, a heart condition, and virtually no knowledge of American customs. But Burt is such a likeable, upbeat fellow with such a great can-do attitude, that he perseveres, and makes many friends along the road to Bonneville with his beloved ""motorsickle."" This is a truly outstanding movie that tells a truly inspiring story of a man who refuses to give up on his dream, and it's a great story that the entire audience can connect with, whether you're into motorcycles or not. It's got a great script (with *many* memorable lines, both funny and touching), and it's brilliantly directed by Roger Donaldson, with Anthony Hopkins simply charming, delightful, and magnificent as Burt Munro. The only other big names you may know in the cast are Diane Ladd as a lonely widow, and comedian Paul Rodriguez as a car salesman who both meet Burt during his journey. Both are excellent in their supporting roles, as are the rest of the cast, who are primarily unknown actors, but they all shine, too, giving their very best next to Hopkins by playing such a terrific array of colorful, memorable characters that Burt meets along the way. And although there are really only a handful of racing scenes in the movie, when they do come, they are truly adrenaline-pumping.I saw ""The World's Fastest Indian"" at my local art-house movie theater, where it played for nearly three months on pure word-of-mouth power. I loved the film so much that I saw it four times. And all four times, as previous reviewers have remarked, the audience broke out in applause at the end. This movie is such a winning, inspirational crowd-pleaser, and it's one of those rare movies that anybody and *everybody* can like and get something out of. And let me say to you once again that you do not have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to appreciate this film. Because, in the end, ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is not about the motorcycle. It's about the man, his dream, and his incredible journey to fulfilling that dream. ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is a movie to treasure.

985058,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000F8DBDK,Alistair McHarg,"[8, 12]","The World's Fastest Indian belongs in the beloved category of films where appealing but semi-cracked protagonists pursue Quixote-esque dreams, encounter crippling setbacks, and ultimately prevail.  This one is even based on fact, but that is no excuse for its blithely optimistic and nutty sensibility.  Burt Munro, a codger played with real brilliance by Anthony Hopkins, is an eccentric ratchet-head whose only dream in life is to take his rebuilt 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle to Bonneville, Utah and see how fast it can go.  For an Everest, it's relatively benign, if demented.The problem is that his trip from Invercargill, New Zealand - (where he lives and works in a miserable shed, torturing his neighbors by gunning his bike at 4:00 A.M.) - to record-breaking success on the Utah salt flats, affords not one whiff of struggle or setback.  The nastiest person he meets on his epic journey is a surly cab driver.  A Nevada cop who discovers him doing 150 mph lets him off with a good-natured warning.  Indeed, the entire film seems bathed in a halo of warm, soft, golden light - the kind of light directors wait for all day until it arrives just before dusk.The film has charm, and there is a wonderful contrast between the heavily funded, modern speed maniacs and Munro, whose bike seems held together by baling wire, duct tape, and rubber cement.  Hopkins, whose fame is a liability in situations like this, manages the nice trick of disappearing into Munro, a modest, unassuming, and quite level headed individual with no interest in the spotlight.  (The anti-Evel Knievel.)  However, the net result is a breezy, effortless feeling, as though we were watching a spry, cheery senior citizen climbing Everest one fine Sunday, stopping for tea at the Summit, and dawdling down to base camp in time for supper.A transvestite with a heart of gold, the world's only ethical used car salesman (wonderfully played by Paul Rodriguez), and a welcoming widow with a warm smile and (as luck would have it) welding equipment (Diane Ladd), add gratuitous quirkiness at best.  It's a great story, I only wish I hadn't realized he would make it before the opening credits were through.  In a good movie, it doesn't matter if the ending is known.  In this movie, all that's left is the trip itself - and there is not one second that feels like it's going 201 mph.",3,History's Easiest Everest,1153612800,"07 23, 2006",2006,2355,"['World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'belongs', 'beloved', 'category', 'films', 'where', 'appealing', 'semi-cracked', 'protagonists', 'pursue', 'Quixote-esque', 'dreams', 'encounter', 'crippling', 'setbacks', 'ultimately', 'prevail', 'one', 'even', 'based', 'fact', 'excuse', 'blithely', 'optimistic', 'nutty', 'sensibility', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'codger', 'played', 'real', 'brilliance', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'eccentric', 'ratchet-head', 'only', 'dream', 'life', 'take', 'rebuilt', '1920', 'Indian', 'Scout', 'motorcycle', 'Bonneville', 'Utah', 'see', 'how', 'fast', 'can', 'go', 'Everest', 'relatively', 'benign', 'demented.The', 'problem', 'trip', 'Invercargill', 'New', 'Zealand', 'where', 'miserable', 'shed', 'torturing', 'neighbors', 'gunning', 'bike', '4:00', 'A.M.', 'record-breaking', 'success', 'Utah', 'salt', 'flats', 'affords', 'not', 'one', 'whiff', 'struggle', 'setback', 'nastiest', 'person', 'epic', 'journey', 'surly', 'cab', 'driver', 'Nevada', 'cop', 'who', 'doing', '150', 'mph', 'lets', 'off', 'good-natured', 'warning', 'Indeed', 'entire', 'film', 'bathed', 'halo', 'warm', 'soft', 'golden', 'light', 'kind', 'light', 'directors', 'wait', 'day', 'just', 'dusk.The', 'film', 'charm', 'wonderful', 'contrast', 'heavily', 'funded', 'modern', 'speed', 'maniacs', 'Munro', 'bike', 'held', 'together', 'baling', 'wire', 'duct', 'tape', 'rubber', 'cement', 'Hopkins', 'fame', 'liability', 'situations', 'nice', 'trick', 'disappearing', 'Munro', 'modest', 'unassuming', 'quite', 'level', 'headed', 'individual', 'interest', 'spotlight', 'anti-Evel', 'Knievel', 'However', 'net', 'result', 'breezy', 'effortless', 'feeling', 'were', 'watching', 'spry', 'cheery', 'senior', 'citizen', 'climbing', 'Everest', 'one', 'fine', 'Sunday', 'stopping', 'tea', 'Summit', 'dawdling', 'down', 'base', 'camp', 'time', 'supper.A', 'transvestite', 'heart', 'gold', 'world', 'only', 'ethical', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Paul', 'Rodriguez', 'welcoming', 'widow', 'warm', 'smile', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'welding', 'equipment', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'add', 'gratuitous', 'quirkiness', 'best', 'great', 'story', 'only', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'realized', 'would', 'make', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'through', 'good', 'movie', ""n't"", 'matter', 'ending', 'known', 'movie', 'left', 'trip', 'not', 'one', 'second', 'going', '201', 'mph']",N/A

His neighbors think he is a little delusional, but he is really rather a harmless eccentric. Both man and machine have seen better days, but that can't stop Munro from following his dreams. I don't know anything about the real Burt Munro, but Anthony Hopkins vivid portrayal gives me an idea of what the man was like. In the film he is portrayed as bit of a rube, but with a charming personality and infectious enthusiasm.After saving up some money and mortgaging his house Munro sets off for America. Once in America he meets some rather eccentric characters in Hollywood. I have no idea if the cross dressing hotel clerk really existed, but the characters are interesting enough to avoid this film being a clich&eacute; fish out water story. The clerk helps the bewildered Munro find his way around his unfamiliar surroundings. He finally purchases a car and heads to the salt flats.Once he arrives at the salt flats he is helped by fellow drivers to register, which he has forgotten to do. Most of the characters in the film seem to be taken with his determination to reach his goal matter how preposterous it may seem. The 40 year bike is incredibly primitive compared to the other machines on display. Both Munro and his bike seem to be an anachronism.The judges are hesitant to let him run his machine, but change their mind when the other drivers pull some strings. At first he is somewhat of a curiosity. What can this man do with such an archaic machine? When the race begins the films starts to build up the drama. At first the awkward machine wiggles uncontrollably, but starts to build up speed. The announcer gets more excited as this antique bike builds up speed. Finally the 200mph barrier is broken, and record is set for this class of motorcycle. The message of the film is quite simple. You are never too old to realize your dreams.

This is a great flick and Anthony Hopkins is at his subtle best!Way more than 5 stars.The synopsis:Burt Munro, a Kiwi from far south New Zealand has been building and rebuilding his motorcycle for the last 40 years, dreaming of the day when he and the bike can go to Bonneville Salt Flats,USA and see what they can really do. When Burt's heart goes bad on him, his dreaming is threatened to come to an end. Burt is not ready to stop dreaming. He decides to mortgage his house and bring his dream to life. He and the motorcycle head for American and the Bonneville Salt Flats,Utah to participate in 'Speed Week'. When they land in in the US the fun begins. His journey from Long Beach to Utah brings him through a cross section of American 'characters'. Each recognizes in Burt, that burning desire to achieve a dream and each helps him in the way that they can to make that dream happen. There are so many funny and beautiful moments but one that come to mind is when Burt meets Tina, the transvestite motel clerk...that whole interaction is so beautiful. Or when Burt finally stands on Bonneville Salt Flats, by himself thinking of all the greatness that has transpired here and now he, Burt Munro, can at last test himself on this 'sacred ground'. Man! it brings shivers to see Anthony Hopkins do that moment.While the film is about motorcycles and fast cars, it is not a movie about motorheads. It is a story we can all get something out of- even your Grandma will love it. Don't hold back-go see it now.  A Cultural Sidebar:I happen to have been in New Zealand when this film started it's world release in it's home country..Oct. 2005. The Kiwis, normally a reserved and sober lot, were crazy on this movie. For a week that is all the entertainment news there was, end to end on both islands. Munro's actually Indian Scout motorcycle made the rounds of movie houses, sort of a hero's artifact for theater goers inspection. In general, the Kiwis felt that Hopkins and Donaldson had really nailed the Kiwi national 'character', straight talking but not offensive, a master of '#8 wire' ingenuity, reserved but determined. All this allowed Munro to build his bike to it's peak,get it to America, and rise above the better financed competition. Hopkins was given accolades for nailing a South Island,New Zealand accent.People that had known Munro claimed Hopkins had portrayed Munro as they knew him. As an American I like they way Donaldson portrayed Americans.I found the movie to be a classic American dream tale.

Give Burt some welding equipment and he can make anything.  He hasn't got many years left on him, and wants to race his ancient Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt flats for a world speed record before he dies.He does.  On the way to this success he meets many people and charms every single one of them with his sweetness and determination: the crew of a tramp steamer, many customs agents, a black transvestite hotel clerk in Hollywood, a Hispanic used car salesman, a lonely Nevada widow, an aging native American, a famous race car driver, and every single person present at Bonneville's Speed week.It's terrific fun to watch Anthony Hopkins endear himself to this long long stream of people.  The makers of the movie do a great job giving the viewers the sheer exhiliration of going so fast.  Despite this, I confess I felt the movie could have used a bit more dramatic tension: basically, the obstacles that Burt faces collapse like popped balloons in the face of his charm.

I finally watched it late last night...and it was very good!  It's definately a more classic style movie story, reminding me of the ""wholesome"" Disney movies I watched as a kid.  As an underdog tale, this movie reminds you to dream big and take risks.  Just read that tagline at the top of the poster above...I love it!Director Roger Donaldson is a Kiwi, i.e. he's from New Zealand, and he's been wanting to tell this story about fellow Kiwi motorcycle enthusiast Burt Munro for over 20 years.  I've enjoyed previous Donaldson movies I've seen, including Thirteen Days (2000), The Recruit (2003), Cocktail (1988) and No Way Out (1987).  Thirteen Days being my favorite of Donaldson's collection.  I think what was lacking from The World's Fastest Indian was a more ""cinematic"" story...unfortunately, Burt Munro's life story just isn't as exciting as maybe it needed to be in order to make a truly great movie.  To me that is one of the most difficult challenges for a screenwriter or a filmmaker is to make a great story into a great movie...not just a great read or a great book.  One reason I think people always say ""the book was better than the movie"" is because the story in the book was great in that format, but it takes something more than just turning that story into a film in order to make it a great movie.  There are certain dynamics that we look for in movies that are different than books simply because of the medium.  In books, we use our imagination more than we do with movies.  Because movies use more of our senses, they automatically have to give us more.

I was naive enough (when I first saw the title) to believe this might be about that. Oh well. Even so, I wasn't disappointed. Indeed, I was educated. Never having heard of the astounding accomplishment of this aged New Zealander, I now feel honored to have been privy to a man of unique stamina and determination.Burt Monro is this man--one of indeterminate age but obviously old enough to collect his pension--and has been working on his 1920 Indian motorcycle for four decades. His goal is to make it go faster ...and faster ...and faster. But his methods appear substandard. He works (and lives) in a shed without appropriate casting material. His gas cap is a whiskey cork, his brakes non-existent. But Burt has a dream. He wants to set a land-speed record in Bonneville, Utah at the salt flats. Thus our journey begins. But getting from New Zealand to the U.S. is costly and Burt doesn't have much money. So we watch him struggle with finances and dilapidated equipment in order to make his dream a reality. Once in the States, Burt befriends everyone he meets with his easy-going manner and his dogged determination. He runs into crooked car salesmen and horny older women (Burt is somewhat of a ""hound-dog"" himself). But through it all, regardless of where he stops, he has the underlying need to keep moving toward Bonneville. And, finally, he makes it there ...only to be told that he should've registered months ago and can't participate in the speed ceremonies. Crushed beyond words, Burt musters the support of the local speed freaks and finally gets his day on the salt.And, much to the surprise of the officials (who thought he'd crash and burn or maybe hit 100 miles per hour), Burt accomplishes the impossible: a new land speed record! At one point, his Little-Indian-That-Could went over 200 mph!This is an extremely entertaining film for two basic reasons. First is because it's a human interest story that everyone can identify with: going after your dreams regardless of what others say or how old you are. The second is because of Sir Anthony Hopkins. His performance was the fuel that drove this film. His mannerisms and accent fit Burt Monro's to a tee (you'll discover this if you watch a few of the DVD's extra features).There were a few blips and bumps in the film (the rapid telling of a relationship with a woman in the U.S. which felt forced for time, etc.), but these were easily overlooked by Mr. Hopkins performance and the incredible story. My hat's off to director Roger Donaldson. His passion for Mr. Monro (and this material) shone through like sun on a silver platter.

Once again he molds himself into the role so well you will believe he is Burt Munro. Few movies make me laugh and cry and I was reminded of another wonderful story of two old cantankerous men in ""Second Hand Lions"". Hopkins shows that Munro truly touched the people that he came in contact with, no matter what walks of life. He was truly an incredible mechanic and driver. An amazing life that wasn't done yet even in 1967, at the age of sixty-eight, when he set the world speed record with a 1920 Indian motorcycle, for the less than 1000cc vehicle class. If he had just stayed in New Zealand he would have been remembered but his journey to compete in the speed trials at Bonneville, UT put him in the history books. The journey itself unfolds in this movie. As most agree, half the fun is getting there. The people he meets along the way make the movie great. Without them it would have been very good, but I don't think great. Exceptional performances by the support cast along with Anthony Hopkins dead on accent and portrayal of Munro make this one you really should not miss. Munro's journey to the Salt Flats is difficult and rewarding, and thanks to some great people he makes it to the trials. His fortune now looks bad for he had not registered for the trials. If you are not familiar with the racing community you earn a respect for it perhaps after you see what transpires. I have to say from my own experience with going to car races and racing autocross I am not surprised by the comradery exhibited. Don't miss this one, it is well worth checking out and a good family movie. Good replayability so if you enjoy movies like ""Second Hand Lions"" I recommend buying it.

That man is Burt Munro, and he's played amazingly well in this movie by Anthony Hopkins, who proves, yet again, that he's one of the greatest actors ever (who else could play Hannibal Lecter, Richard Nixon and Burt Munro and do them all SO WELL?).The movie is based on Burt Munro (from Invercargill, New Zealand, as he tells anyone who asks). He was an ageing Kiwi who wanted to go to the Bonneville Salt Flats with his Indian motorcyle and see just how fast it would go. This movie chronicles his effort to do just that.Watching the film, you'd almost claim that Munro was a made-up character. A fiction, put forth by New Zealand to prove that they're more than just Middle Earth's stunt-double. But, no, he was a real person and from what I saw in this movie, one heck of a guy! The sort of man you'd like to just hang out with for a few hours, listening to him tell stories.That Munro does indeed get to Bonneville and run his bike is no surprise. But the journey he takes to get there is amazingly interesting. The film takes a bit to get going, but once he hits the ground in the US, there's no stopping the movie, and if you don't find yourself wanting to stand up and cheer at the end, there may be no hope for you (and you might need to watch a few Michael Bay films as punishment).Equally interesting on the DVD is the documentary, ""Offerings to the Gods of Speed"", which is a documentary film by the same director showing you the real-life Burt Munro. You'll learn that, if anything, Hopkins may have dialed the performance down a tad, as anyone playing Burt Munro true-to-life would surely be accused of wretched overacting.I have no interest in motorcycles or things that go fast.

985098,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,B000F8DBDK,Craig Connell,"[1, 1]","This was an interesting story of an older guy traveling all the day from New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah to try to set a world speed record on his motorcycle. With Anthony Hopkins playing that man, you know it's not some hokey little B-film. It's also based on real-life character who did this back in 1969.This film reminded me of ""The Straight Story,"" starring Richard Farnsworth. That dealt with an old man taking a long tractor ride across the state of Iowa to see his dying brother. It featured a bunch of nice characters he met along his journey. This is much the same as we witness Munro's encounters with a variety of people in the United States. Like ""The Straight Story,"" all the people are good people and help our man. That's nice to see.Once he finally gets to the Salt Flats, however, his problems are far from over as he is unable to meet any of the minimum safety standards. It appears he made his trip for nothing, but, you'll see what happens if you view this movie/Once again, having no villains was very appealing to me. New Zealanders say Hopkins did them proud, too, and they would know if he did a good job or not playing a man from their area of the world, whether he sounded and acted realistically. They say he did.I enjoyed the first 35 minutes of this story the most. Maybe because that's the most innocent part of the film and features a young boy who looks up to Bert and encourages him when few others are willing to do so.It's when Munro reaches America where the ""nice, clean family film"" goes south a bit. He hooks up with transvestites, one-night stands, profanes here and there and the PC angle gets a little overplayed. However, despite those negatives that make America a little too weird, everything is done is a tasteful way and it still was a wonderful story. It has to be an inspiration for older folks who might think life's challenges are over once they hit a certain age. Not so, as Mr. Munro shows us in this inspiring, well-photographed film.This certainly is quite an unknown movie for one which has such a famous actor in the starring role.

985099,AUHG8KSHI529U,B000F8DBDK,Craig Matteson,"[7, 7]","Anymore, I enjoy these kinds of character pieces much more than the big budget action or special effects movies.  Anthony Hopkins provides us with an interesting man, Burt Munro, who is obsessed with speed and working on his bike.  The movie is based on a real life motorcycle tinkerer-genius from New Zealand, but like most movies falsifies a great deal about the life of the actual man in order to make a two hour movie that works for the audience while conveying the sweep of the real life of the man.It isn't that the character portrayed in the movie isn't fascinating or that the overall gesture of the movie is false, but rather that the real life was, I think, actually more interesting if somewhat less ""cinematic"".  The movie makes Burt Munro into a complete ""MAN ALONE"" and so much of what he accomplished was done by him without commercial help or sponsors.  But his fabrication techniques were even stranger than depicted in the movie.  The piston casting shown in the film doesn't capture what he did with empty jam tins.  One reporter even has him casting a piston head in the sand on a beach.  Apparently, Munro was also a magician with a file and that is not shown in the film.And though the real Munro was indeed a twin, it was a twin sister who died at birth rather than a twin brother who died in a sad accident while the father was taking down a tree.  I do not know if there was an incident with a tree in Munro's real life.The racing at Bonneville conflates runs from his several trips to the raceway.  The wobble shown in the film actually came in 1967, but it makes for good film and is therefore shown in his first trip.  And the film never makes clear what record he was setting.  Everything in speed racing is about the class of vehicle making the run.  Obviously his small motorcycle isn't going to be faster than a four wheeled power car.  And in his first visit to Bonneville he did not break 200 mph, but that makes a barrier that is easy for an audience to love.He did have a family life and was a grandfather at the time of his first visit to Bonneville, but they are nowhere to be found in the movie, whether for privacy reasons or because there wasn't time in the movie, or because there might have been things in that area that would make Munro less likeable, I do not know.  The film makes him into an instantly likeable charismatic.  This extravert aspect of his personality is something anyone who knew him comments on.  Obviously, Munro was a hero to many and loved enough by enough people to enlist their help in supporting his dreams.As a movie, I like this story a lot and don't need to get hung up on what details are real or not.  Munro as portrayed by Hopkins is a man so focused on a dream that he draws other people into his vision.  He isn't predatory of others, but he is a narcissist and has the charisma that so many of that personality type have.  It is much easier to enjoy these lonely detached personalities in a book or on the screen than in real life.  I do not know what the actual Munro was like, but if he was anything like the eccentric in the film, he would have been fun in small doses and hard on the people who were close to him.  I mean in real life he chose living in his shed with his bike for 40 years over his marriage.  Does that really make sense?  Is that really the better choice for a life?  Yet it was a choice actually made.A fine performance by Hopkins and provides attention to a man who is largely unknown, but whose life deserves its two hours on the screen.  Maybe there is a more accurate telling that should be done as well, but this one is pretty attractive.",5,A wonderfully entertaining character study of a real life motorcycle legend,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,3644,"['Anymore', 'enjoy', 'kinds', 'character', 'pieces', 'much', 'more', 'big', 'budget', 'action', 'special', 'effects', 'movies', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'interesting', 'man', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'who', 'obsessed', 'speed', 'working', 'bike', 'movie', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'motorcycle', 'tinkerer-genius', 'New', 'Zealand', 'most', 'movies', 'great', 'deal', 'life', 'actual', 'man', 'order', 'make', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'audience', 'conveying', 'sweep', 'real', 'life', 'man.It', ""n't"", 'character', 'portrayed', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fascinating', 'overall', 'gesture', 'movie', 'false', 'rather', 'real', 'life', 'was', 'think', 'actually', 'more', 'interesting', 'somewhat', 'less', 'cinematic', 'movie', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'complete', 'MAN', 'ALONE', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'accomplished', 'was', 'done', 'commercial', 'help', 'sponsors', 'fabrication', 'techniques', 'were', 'even', 'stranger', 'depicted', 'movie', 'piston', 'casting', 'shown', 'film', ""n't"", 'capture', 'what', 'did', 'empty', 'jam', 'tins', 'One', 'reporter', 'even', 'casting', 'piston', 'head', 'sand', 'beach', 'Apparently', 'Munro', 'was', 'also', 'magician', 'file', 'not', 'shown', 'film.And', 'real', 'Munro', 'was', 'indeed', 'twin', 'was', 'twin', 'sister', 'who', 'died', 'birth', 'rather', 'twin', 'brother', 'who', 'died', 'sad', 'accident', 'father', 'was', 'taking', 'down', 'tree', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'incident', 'tree', 'Munro', 'real', 'life.The', 'racing', 'Bonneville', 'conflates', 'several', 'trips', 'raceway', 'wobble', 'shown', 'film', 'actually', 'came', '1967', 'good', 'film', 'therefore', 'shown', 'first', 'trip', 'film', 'never', 'clear', 'what', 'record', 'was', 'setting', 'Everything', 'speed', 'racing', 'class', 'vehicle', 'making', 'run', 'Obviously', 'small', 'motorcycle', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'faster', 'four', 'wheeled', 'power', 'car', 'first', 'visit', 'Bonneville', 'did', 'not', 'break', '200', 'mph', 'barrier', 'easy', 'audience', 'love.He', 'did', 'have', 'family', 'life', 'was', 'grandfather', 'time', 'first', 'visit', 'Bonneville', 'are', 'nowhere', 'be', 'found', 'movie', 'privacy', 'reasons', 'was', ""n't"", 'time', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'things', 'area', 'would', 'make', 'Munro', 'less', 'likeable', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'film', 'instantly', 'likeable', 'charismatic', 'extravert', 'aspect', 'personality', 'something', 'anyone', 'who', 'knew', 'comments', 'Obviously', 'Munro', 'was', 'hero', 'many', 'loved', 'enough', 'enough', 'people', 'enlist', 'help', 'supporting', 'dreams.As', 'movie', 'like', 'story', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'what', 'details', 'are', 'real', 'not', 'Munro', 'portrayed', 'Hopkins', 'man', 'so', 'focused', 'dream', 'other', 'people', 'vision', ""n't"", 'predatory', 'others', 'narcissist', 'charisma', 'so', 'many', 'personality', 'type', 'have', 'much', 'easier', 'enjoy', 'lonely', 'detached', 'personalities', 'book', 'screen', 'real', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'actual', 'Munro', 'was', 'was', 'anything', 'eccentric', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'small', 'doses', 'hard', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'close', 'mean', 'real', 'life', 'chose', 'living', 'shed', 'bike', '40', 'years', 'marriage', 'really', 'make', 'sense', 'really', 'better', 'choice', 'life', 'was', 'choice', 'actually', 'made.A', 'fine', 'performance', 'Hopkins', 'attention', 'man', 'who', 'largely', 'unknown', 'life', 'two', 'hours', 'screen', 'Maybe', 'more', 'accurate', 'telling', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'pretty', 'attractive']",N/A

He lives to work on his 1920 Indian motorcycle, constantly rebuilding and improving the engine power using spare parts and hand-forged components. He has a dream of racing his motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and setting a world land-speed record for his class of motorcycle. With the odds against him and on a shoestring budget, he works his way to America on a tramp freighter to pursue his dream, much to the disbelief of his friends.  Because of his upbeat personality he makes friends along the way who help him out: a drag queen who works the night shift at a motel on the Sunset Strip who shows him the ropes of the big city, a used-car salesman who sells him an old car to drive to Utah, an Indian medicine man in the desert who gives him medicine for his prostate, and a cast of other interesting characters.When he arrives at Bonneville, he finds he should have registered weeks before, but the officials lack the heart to turn him away. In Bonneville, where millionaire drivers are sponsored by big corporations, no one has ever seen anyone like Burt. They are amazed when they inspect his machine: A home-built engine? No tread on his tires? No brakes? No braking parachute? No fire-resistant suit? Next they find out his must take nitroglycerin pills for a heart condition.

985102,A21B2TJBWCSK1R,B000F8DBDK,Cubist,"[7, 7]","The World's Fastest Indian is a fictionalized account of Burt Munro (Hopkins) from Invercargill, New Zealand, who personally modified his old 1920s Indian Scout 45 motorcycle into a 200 mph record-breaking machine. The film follows his journey to the United States where he broke the world land speed record for motorcycles with engines less than 1000cc at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in the late 1960s.Anthony Hopkins brings a grizzled optimism to the role. Despite the various obstacles that are put in his path, Burt perseveres with a boundless sense of wonderment but it doesn't feel like a one-dimensional performance. On the contrary, it feels very heartfelt and quite moving once Burt gets close to realizing his dream.Hopkins is supported by a strong cast of character actors that include the likes of Diane Ladd who makes a welcome appearance as a kind lady that helps Burt along his way to Utah. Chris Lawford plays a fellow racer who uses his pull to get Burt into the competition and does such a great job in the role that you'd swear he really was a professional driver. The Shield's Walt Goggins also makes an appearance as one of the car enthusiasts who befriends Burt in Utah and it is nice to see him play such a different role.The World's Fastest Indian swells in its national pride for New Zealand with scenes like the whole town, even the motorcycle gang that bested Burt, there to see the man off when he heads for the U.S. Fortunately, Donaldson plays it down in an understated way. The patriotism is there just not in your face. Burt's irrepressible enthusiasm mirrors the film's own which makes it something of anarchism in these jaded times. It evokes another biopic about an idealistic automotive dreamer, Tucker, Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to car manufacturer Preston Tucker. We need films like The World's Fastest Indian because they remind us of the innovative spirit and the persistence to realize one's dreams.""Making of The World's Fastest Indian"" takes a look at this year-in-the-making project. Cast and crew speak enthusiastically about the subject matter and Donaldson who has been obsessed with Burt and his achievements for many years.There is an audio commentary by director Roger Donaldson. The director points out what in the movie is based on fact and what was fictionalized for dramatic purposes. Donaldson is not only an expert on Burt but also a motorcycle aficionado, delivering an extremely informative track.There are four deleted scenes, including Munro's increasingly bad health that parallels the worsening condition of his car while heading for Utah.In a really nice touch, Donaldson's 1971 documentary, ""Burt Munro: Offerings to the God of Speed"" is included.

985117,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000F8DBDK,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","This 2005 film directed and written by Roger Donaldson is quite a charmer, a true family film with a genuinely heroic protagonist in a compelling story of triumph against the odds. Motorcycle enthusiast Burt Munro has fascinated Donaldson since he made a documentary about the New Zealand folk hero in 1973, ""Offerings to the Gods of Speed"", which is an invaluable extra in the 2006 DVD package. I can see why as this unassuming eccentric with MacGyver-level ingenuity is such a likeable codger with his singular purpose of racing his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle during ""Speed Week"" on the pitch white desolation of the Bonneville Speedway.Fortunately, Anthony Hopkins brings a great deal of heart to Munro and portrays this unique personality with economy and dexterity, even though his Munro-mimicking mumbled tones can make him hard to understand at times. The film follows his journey from Invercargill at the southern tip of New Zealand through the urban jungle of Hollywood to the wide expanses of the salt flats in Utah. It feels like four films combined into one with the first part establishing Munro's eccentricities and local celebrity relative to a watchful boy who lives next door and idolizes the old man. When Munro makes it to California, it becomes a bit like ""Crocodile Dundee"" or any fish-out-of-water comedy with Munro surviving by his wits in spite of his inbred trust in people. The third part is a more standard road movie that echoes ""Transamerica"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" for the stereotypical characters Munro runs into en route to Bonneville.The fourth and final part of the film is the best, as it converts into a Rocky-like episode in Munro's challenging quest to compete and his ultimate victory. Donaldson makes the four sections feel relatively seamless, though I feel he could have edited the second and third parts more given how the pacing starts to lag. There are also some contrived plot elements that could have been jettisoned entirely like the youthful motorcycle gang who switch from threatening hooligans to Munro's financial supporters or the sequence with Diane Ladd as a woman who shares his bed for a night. Other than the Vietnam War soldier talking positively about Agent Orange, the movie actually romanticizes the U.S. of the 1960's in a way that's quite refreshing.The race sequences near the end of the picture are powerfully executed. But it's really Hopkins who completely inhabits Munro and makes the whole movie work emotionally, and to his immense credit, he does it with a minimum of fuss. The DVD package is chockfull of extras all due to the fact that Donaldson has so much passion about his subject. Beyond his original 1973 half-hour documentary on Munro, he lends expert commentary on an alternate track and is also the chief participant in the extensive 45-minute making-of featurette. There are also four deleted scenes plus a brief musical travelogue of New Zealand's Southland. The movie's theatrical run was shamefully limited last December, so hopefully the DVD package will give the movie the greater audience it deserves.",4,Hopkins in Peak Form as New Zealand's Legendary Speed Demon,1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,3098,"['2005', 'film', 'directed', 'written', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'quite', 'charmer', 'true', 'family', 'film', 'genuinely', 'heroic', 'protagonist', 'compelling', 'story', 'triumph', 'odds', 'Motorcycle', 'enthusiast', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'fascinated', 'Donaldson', 'made', 'documentary', 'New', 'Zealand', 'folk', 'hero', '1973', 'Offerings', 'Gods', 'Speed', 'invaluable', 'extra', '2006', 'DVD', 'package', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'unassuming', 'eccentric', 'MacGyver-level', 'ingenuity', 'such', 'likeable', 'codger', 'singular', 'purpose', 'racing', '1920', 'Indian', 'Scout', 'motorcycle', 'Speed', 'Week', 'pitch', 'white', 'desolation', 'Bonneville', 'Speedway.Fortunately', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'great', 'deal', 'heart', 'Munro', 'unique', 'personality', 'economy', 'dexterity', 'even', 'Munro-mimicking', 'mumbled', 'tones', 'can', 'make', 'hard', 'understand', 'times', 'film', 'journey', 'Invercargill', 'southern', 'tip', 'New', 'Zealand', 'urban', 'jungle', 'Hollywood', 'wide', 'expanses', 'salt', 'flats', 'Utah', 'four', 'films', 'combined', 'one', 'first', 'part', 'establishing', 'Munro', 'eccentricities', 'local', 'celebrity', 'relative', 'watchful', 'boy', 'who', 'next', 'door', 'old', 'man', 'When', 'Munro', 'California', 'bit', 'Crocodile', 'Dundee', 'fish-out-of-water', 'comedy', 'Munro', 'surviving', 'wits', 'spite', 'inbred', 'trust', 'people', 'third', 'part', 'more', 'standard', 'road', 'movie', 'Transamerica', 'Motorcycle', 'Diaries', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'Munro', 'en', 'route', 'Bonneville.The', 'fourth', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'best', 'Rocky-like', 'episode', 'Munro', 'challenging', 'quest', 'compete', 'ultimate', 'victory', 'Donaldson', 'four', 'sections', 'feel', 'relatively', 'seamless', 'feel', 'could', 'have', 'edited', 'second', 'third', 'parts', 'more', 'given', 'how', 'pacing', 'lag', 'are', 'also', 'contrived', 'plot', 'elements', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'jettisoned', 'entirely', 'youthful', 'motorcycle', 'gang', 'who', 'switch', 'threatening', 'hooligans', 'Munro', 'financial', 'supporters', 'sequence', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'woman', 'who', 'shares', 'bed', 'night', 'Other', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'soldier', 'talking', 'positively', 'Agent', 'Orange', 'movie', 'actually', 'U.S.', '1960', 'way', 'quite', 'refreshing.The', 'race', 'sequences', 'end', 'picture', 'are', 'powerfully', 'executed', 'really', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'completely', 'Munro', 'whole', 'movie', 'work', 'emotionally', 'immense', 'credit', 'minimum', 'fuss', 'DVD', 'package', 'chockfull', 'extras', 'due', 'fact', 'Donaldson', 'so', 'much', 'passion', 'subject', 'original', '1973', 'half-hour', 'documentary', 'Munro', 'expert', 'commentary', 'alternate', 'track', 'also', 'chief', 'participant', 'extensive', '45-minute', 'making-of', 'featurette', 'are', 'also', 'four', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'brief', 'musical', 'travelogue', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Southland', 'movie', 'theatrical', 'run', 'was', 'shamefully', 'limited', 'last', 'December', 'so', 'hopefully', 'DVD', 'package', 'will', 'give', 'movie', 'greater', 'audience']",N/A

His Munro seems very much like the archival footage of the man (included with the disc) - determined, focused, but strangely unsentimental. It's a man whose actions are so guided by his vision that he's managed to detach himself from all but a few essential personal relationships. I won't go into plot details here, there are plenty of other reviewers who've already done so.I almost wish, though, that the writers had taken less liberties with the actual timeline of Munro's achievements at the salt flats.

985119,A100UD67AHFODS,B000F8DBDK,"Expressed Reviews ""Expressed Reviews""","[4, 4]","A truly astounding film, and an outstanding performance by Anthony Hopkins, who precisely portrays all of the charm, character, and zest for life of Burt Munro, a New Zealand native, who spends 25 years working on, and refining his 1920's Indian motorcycle, all in an effort to travel to Utah's Bonneville Speedway, where he astonishes the spectators, timers, and fellow racers with his 1920 Indian Scout cycle. Hopkins performance is second to none, and his bright outlook on life, regardless of the circumstances, truly gives all around him a lift. His friendly, optimistic attitude goes a long way in making him friends with everyone he comes into contact with. It also has a profound effect on the viewer, as his laugh and upbeat demeanor will make you feel just plain good.This film is far more about the character of Burt Munro, than it is about motorcycles. Munro is a bit on the eccentric side, but certainly in a nice way, and as mentioned, is able to make friends everywhere he goes. This is a great film for old as well as young viewers. It shows us all that age doesn't have to be a determining factor in how we live our lives. Munro, who suffered from Angina, never once doubted that he would reach his dream of racing his motorcycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats. It made no difference to him whether he lived or died, it was the journey along the way that made everything worthwhile. Burt is such a likable guy, that one would be hard pressed not to feel better simply by being in his company. His positive attitude is really what the film is all about. Through his sheer determination and his gregarious attitude about both the good and the bad, doors were opened to many opportunities that otherwise would have been closed. It was because of these qualities that the officials at the Bonneville Speedway allowed him to race, when under any other circumstances he wouldn't have been given a fighting chance.Munro makes the statement, ""You live more in five minutes on a bike like this going flat out than some people live in a lifetime."" These words couldn't ring more true. For the dreamer in all of us, ""The World's Fastest Indian,"" sends out a loud and clear message to grab life by the horns and live it now. It certainly makes me feel that way, and also reminds me that life is all about attitude. A positive, upbeat attitude will take you a long way in life, as evidenced in the life of Burt Munro, and this wonderful film. ""The World's Fastest Indian"" deserves 10 stars!The film and life of Burt Munro reminds me of the poem by Nadine Stair, when she was 85 years old....If I Had My Life to Live OverI'd dare to make more mistakes next time.I'd relax. I would limber up.I would be sillier than I have been this trip.I would take fewer things seriously.I would take more chances.I would take more trips.I would climb more mountains and swim more rivers.I would eat more ice cream and less beans.I would perhaps have more actual troubles but I'dhave fewer imaginary ones.You see, I'm one of those people who live sensiblyand sanely hour after hour, day after day.Oh, I've had my moments and if I had it to do overagain, I'd have more of them. In fact,I'd try to have nothing else. Just moments.One after another, instead of living so manyyears ahead of each day.I've been one of those people who never go anywherewithout a thermometer, a hot water bottle, a raincoatand a parachute.If I had my life to live over, I would start barefootearlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall.If I had it to do again, I would travel lighter next time.I would go to more dances.I would ride more merry-go-rounds.I would pick more daisies.",5,Grab Life by the Horns and Live it Now,1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,3657,"['truly', 'astounding', 'film', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'precisely', 'charm', 'character', 'zest', 'life', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'New', 'Zealand', 'native', 'who', '25', 'years', 'working', 'refining', '1920', 'Indian', 'motorcycle', 'effort', 'travel', 'Utah', 'Bonneville', 'Speedway', 'where', 'spectators', 'timers', 'fellow', 'racers', '1920', 'Indian', 'Scout', 'cycle', 'Hopkins', 'performance', 'second', 'none', 'bright', 'outlook', 'life', 'regardless', 'circumstances', 'truly', 'lift', 'friendly', 'optimistic', 'attitude', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'friends', 'everyone', 'contact', 'also', 'profound', 'effect', 'viewer', 'laugh', 'upbeat', 'demeanor', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'just', 'plain', 'good.This', 'film', 'far', 'more', 'character', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'motorcycles', 'Munro', 'bit', 'eccentric', 'side', 'certainly', 'nice', 'way', 'as', 'mentioned', 'able', 'make', 'friends', 'everywhere', 'great', 'film', 'old', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'viewers', 'age', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'determining', 'factor', 'how', 'live', 'lives', 'Munro', 'who', 'suffered', 'Angina', 'never', 'once', 'doubted', 'would', 'reach', 'dream', 'racing', 'motorcycle', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'made', 'difference', 'lived', 'died', 'was', 'journey', 'way', 'made', 'everything', 'worthwhile', 'Burt', 'such', 'likable', 'guy', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'not', 'feel', 'better', 'simply', 'being', 'company', 'positive', 'attitude', 'really', 'what', 'film', 'sheer', 'determination', 'gregarious', 'attitude', 'good', 'bad', 'doors', 'were', 'opened', 'many', 'opportunities', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'was', 'qualities', 'officials', 'Bonneville', 'Speedway', 'allowed', 'race', 'when', 'other', 'circumstances', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'given', 'fighting', 'chance.Munro', 'statement', 'live', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'bike', 'going', 'flat', 'out', 'people', 'live', 'lifetime', 'words', 'could', ""n't"", 'ring', 'more', 'true', 'dreamer', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'out', 'loud', 'clear', 'message', 'grab', 'life', 'horns', 'live', 'now', 'certainly', 'feel', 'way', 'also', 'life', 'attitude', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'attitude', 'will', 'take', 'long', 'way', 'life', 'evidenced', 'life', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'wonderful', 'film', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', '10', 'stars', 'film', 'life', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'poem', 'Nadine', 'Stair', 'when', 'was', '85', 'years', 'old', '.If', 'Had', 'My', 'Life', 'Live', 'OverI', ""'d"", 'dare', 'make', 'more', 'mistakes', 'time.I', ""'d"", 'relax', 'would', 'limber', 'up.I', 'would', 'be', 'sillier', 'have', 'been', 'trip.I', 'would', 'take', 'fewer', 'things', 'seriously.I', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'chances.I', 'would', 'take', 'more', 'trips.I', 'would', 'climb', 'more', 'mountains', 'swim', 'more', 'rivers.I', 'would', 'eat', 'more', 'ice', 'cream', 'less', 'beans.I', 'would', 'perhaps', 'have', 'more', 'actual', 'troubles', ""I'dhave"", 'fewer', 'imaginary', 'ones.You', 'see', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'sensiblyand', 'sanely', 'hour', 'hour', 'day', 'day.Oh', ""'ve"", 'had', 'moments', 'had', 'do', 'overagain', ""'d"", 'have', 'more', 'fact', ""'d"", 'try', 'have', 'nothing', 'else', 'Just', 'moments.One', 'instead', 'living', 'so', 'manyyears', 'ahead', 'day.I', ""'ve"", 'been', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'never', 'go', 'anywherewithout', 'thermometer', 'hot', 'water', 'bottle', 'raincoatand', 'parachute.If', 'had', 'life', 'live', 'would', 'start', 'barefootearlier', 'spring', 'stay', 'way', 'later', 'fall.If', 'had', 'do', 'again', 'would', 'travel', 'lighter', 'next', 'time.I', 'would', 'go', 'more', 'dances.I', 'would', 'ride', 'more', 'merry-go-rounds.I', 'would', 'pick', 'more', 'daisies']",N/A

985125,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000F8DBDK,Grady Harp,"[6, 7]","It seems many viewers avoided this film when it was in the theaters because the title was confusing and not representative of the story.  The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins was the lead actor should have been a signal of sorts, but it took the release of the DVD for this viewer to reluctantly rent the film when other possibilities were low.  Big Mistake!  This is one of the more genuinely fine films about the idomitability of the human spirit that has been released in some time.Based on a true story, the 'Indian' of the title has nothing to do with the heritage of the character Burt Munro, a 67 year old odd but generously kind New Zealander whose lifelong passion is to race his 1923 'Indian motorbike' in the Bonneville Salt Flats Races in America.  Burt lives for his dreams and despite the fact that his idiosyncrasies befuddle his neighbors and townsfolk (with the except of the little boy Tom next door who idolizes him), he manages to make everyone with whom he comes into contact admire, and yes, love him.  Using his own skills he brings his old motorbike to the point that he can enter the race in the States and with the financial help of his friends he manages to board a ship with his bike and sail to America.  In the US he is a fish out of water and must adjust to the city life and attitudes of the Americans, but eventually, through his innate charm and dedication to his dream, he does manage against all odds and, with the help of many American new friends, enter the race to break the world's record for speed on a motorbike.Hopkins owns the role of Burt and despite his not always on target New Zealand accent he manages to deliver surely one of his most endearing portrayals of his rich career.  His encounters with Tom, with a feisty widow Ada (Diane Ladd), with a fine old wise Indian man, and with a transsexual motel clerk Tina (Chris Williams), to name only a few of the superb supporting cast - are the epitome of underplayed fine acting and engender so much warmth that tears of happiness just can't be avoided.  Writer and director Roger Donaldson deserves a standing ovation for this small, sensitive, gentle, understated tale that demonstrates so well how being true to your visions and your dreams can overcome almost any obstacle.

Could it be because movies these days are banal trash??  I'm a total movie buff just heard about this one by accident (1 year after it's release!)...I bought it last week and must say without reservation that this is in my opinion one of the finest, most uplifting movies ever made.  Based on a real guy who took everything (even disappointment) in stride and stayed positive even when things looked their bleakest.  My husband and I went through half a box of tissue between us and found ourselves applauding and cheering out loud every time something went Burt's way.SPOILER ALERT!  This movie has no sex scenes, no swearing, no blood or guts, no explosions, no special effects, no insanely overblown soundtrack and absolutely zero chance of becoming the hottest new X-Box game.  If that's what you're into you'll probably hate this movie....but to you I say try it--you just might fall in love (and find your standards raised in the process).If you are sick of the garbage cranked out by Hollywood on a weekly basis I highly recommend this film.  I find it disheartening that something like this receives virtually no press what so ever, yet you can't turn on the TV without hearing the praises of the latest ""Jackass"" movie sung ad nausium.  To put my money where my mouth is every single person on my Christmas list is getting a copy of this DVD this year...if the producers see that it's popular even though not heralded (and if they make money) maybe we'll start seeing more of this kind of film.

985135,A192KEPM0HW6AC,B000F8DBDK,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[3, 3]","In this independently released sleeper, consummate actor's actor Anthony Hopkins brings a deceptively diminutive, real-life hero--legendary motorcyclist Burt Munro--to the big screen in a larger-than-life biopic. Directed with heartfelt passion by Australian Roger Donaldson, The World's Fastest Indian tells the improbable story of one man's all-consuming mission to become the fastest man on two wheels.For twenty-five years, New Zealander Burt Munro has dreamed of trekking far from the shores of his town of Invercargill to take a shot at breaking the motorcycle land speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah. But as the movie opens, we find not some youth with the latest tricked-out bike, but a pensioner pushing seventy and nursing hardened arteries, for which he must take nitroglycerin pills to prevent his heart from giving out. Pushing his dream even farther from the reaches of reality, he plans to ride to glory on a mechanical antique--his beloved 1920 Indian Scout. The bike originally left the factory able to reach a top speed of fifty-four miles per hour; but Burt intends to reach 200.Hopkins is brilliant in capturing the unassuming outer persona of Munro. His portrayal gives us the sense not that we are in the presence of greatness so much as resolute persistence. Burt Munro is a self-effacing charmer and tinkerer whose eccentric personality is out of phase with his stolid, suburbanite neighbors. They, understandably, are more than mildly annoyed by his loudly revving bike engine before the break of dawn, and by his absent-mindedness about getting around to mowing his lawn.One neighbor, though, twelve-year-old Tom, sees in Burt not some tottering old crank, but a hero and mentor. The scenes in Burt's tool shed as Tom listens to the old man's reminisces and aspirations are among the movie's most sincere and enchanting. Even as we are subtly prodded not to take Burt completely seriously, Tom's uncorrupted awe and youthful idolization help stoke the man's quiet inner passion to see his plan to fruition.""If you don't follow through on your dreams, you might as well be a vegetable,"" he counsels the boy.""What kind of vegetable?"" Tom inquires.With biting succinctness, Hopkins replies, ""A cabbage.""One thing that separates Burt from a legion of dreamers who abandon their ambitions is his resourcefulness. On a shoestring budget, he constantly employs his mechanical ingenuity to modify the Indian, with which he is more intimate than he is with any living person. Never taking a day off, not even for Christmas, he spends untold hours and days forging new pistons and souping up his ""motorsicle,"" readying it for the big trip.Much of the movie concerns itself with Burt's personal odyssey to Bonneville for ""Speed Week."" He finances part of the journey by working as a cook and dishwasher on a freighter bound for America. Upon arrival, he works late into the night repairing a cheap old clunker to tow the Indian across the desert to Utah. Along the way we meet a benevolent, motley crew who happen into and out of Burt's life, including a fast-talking used car salesman (comedian Paul Rodriguez) whom Burt nearly kills while test driving on the left side of the road; a hotel desk clerk in drag (Chris Williams); an aging American Indian (Saginaw Grant) who helps Burt out of a tight spot; a widow, Ada (Diane Ladd), who takes a respite from loneliness during a brief encounter with Burt; and an Airman on furlough from Vietnam (Patrick Flueger).In a quietly reflective scene, Burt relates to Ada what motivates him to push himself further:A man is like a blade of grass. He grows up in the spring, strong and healthy and green. And, then he reaches middle age and he ripens, as it were. And, in the autumn, he finishes, he fades away and never comes back...I think that when you're dead, you're dead.In this soliloquy Hopkins summarizes the film's philosophy--that there's no room for soothing stagnation on Earth by nurturing dreams to be fulfilled only in the hereafter. Life must be lived now, because tomorrow may never come.Arriving in Bonneville, Burt must overcome new challenges strewn in his path: Speed Week organizers inform him that he forgot to pre-register; his ancient motorcycle has no safety equipment; he's simply too old to be allowed to race in the time trials. But because of his dogged refusal to back down after traveling around the world, the race organizers humor Burt and allow him to enter the time trials.The World's Fastest Indian is superb in every respect. For director Donaldson, it represents the fulfillment of a double obsession: dramatizing Burt Munro's breathtaking pursuit of his lifelong goal, and realizing Donaldson's own quarter-century quest to bring his hero-friend's incredible story to the screen. David Gribble's lush cinematography is full of vibrant hues and astounding moving camerawork, expertly capturing racing vehicles traveling at speeds topping 200 miles per hour.But it's Hopkins who ultimately makes this picture work so well, in his most heroic role since playing efficacious industrialist Charles Morse in 1997's The Edge. Though not given to hyperbole, Hopkins proclaimed The World's Fastest Indian ""the best film I've been in."" I agree, absolutely. His natural, evocative portrayal of a man who refuses to resign himself to the tedium expected of one in old age will inspire viewers of all ages. His Burt Munro is not content merely to dream, but is that rare individual who makes his dreams reality. ""For me, it's a big change,"" Hopkins commented about Munro, ""because it's a real winner of a guy. I've had a good career playing psychopaths or uptight people, and I'm fed up with those.""Ironically, his rousing performance of this aging hero is the best depiction of the spirit of youth I've seen in a decade. Spend a couple hours with Burt Munro, and you'll find in his quiet resolve the idealism you may have mislaid somewhere along the way.",5,Another Lion in Winter,1179619200,"05 20,

985136,A2LPCZ7UBT4Y6N,B000F8DBDK,"Jameson L. Thottam ""mortgage maven""","[4, 5]","Jameson Thottam with an Indian's Perspective (pun intended) on this FilmBurt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), approaching his seventies, with a chronic heart problem, has followed a dream all his life - to break the world land speed record with his 1928 Indian (1000 cc) motorcycle. To do this, he has to raise the funds to take himself and his beloved Indian from New Zealand to the States; at Bonneville, Utah, on the vast salt plains Burt will compete against world class champs and vehicles.With his savings, and the help of his small community, Burt crates his machine, has it loaded onto a dubious-looking vessel and works his passage to L.A. as ship's cook. Once in the US, he buys a second-hand car, rigs up a trailer and tows the Indian to his destination.Following the Move **Jameson Thottam**The movie follows Burt and his adventures across the US to Bonneville, encountering some weird and wonderful characters along the way (Tina, the transvestite who runs a tacky LA motel; Fernando - a oily, fast-talking Hispanic car salesman; Ada, a lonely but lusty widow; even a real Indian out in the desert.... Shades here of Croc Dundee). Once at his destination, Burt finds he has more obstacles to surmount, but as usual tackles them with his never-say-die philosophy.How It's Done **Jameson Thottam**When the movie opens, Burt is asleep in his shed, a rough concrete structure which houses him, his workshop and the Indian. To either side, there are neat gardens and homes, but Burt's place is the scene of blown gaskets and spare parts, a drum containing titanium-flavoured water (also used for tea!), the ground is covered with tall grass; in a corner droops a lemon tree which he `waters' daily, claiming that urine is great fertilizer!His young neighbour is fascinated by the Indian and the work that goes into it, and against his parents' wishes, is continually at Burt's side; even borrowing his mother's carving knife so Burt can peel off the tyre tread to render them faster (who cares about safety!). Gradually the other characters are introduced, Burt finds himself a girlfriend, the small community organizes a fund-raising dance, and finally the local bikie gang challenge him to a speed race (which he loses) on one of New Zealand's vast panoramic beaches; Burt's gentle nature, his enthusiasm and commitment to his cause win over all those who meet him; even the hostile bikies admit grudging admiration - when Burt heads off on his journey, the leader pulls level with the car and presses some ""drink money"" into his hand.The Portrayal **Jameson Thottam**Burt is portrayed as a down-to-earth guy, who opts for simplicity in his life - that way he can concentrate on what is really important: his bike. The fact that he is in his seventies in no way diminishes his enthusiasm or his belief that he can succeed. In addition, what some viewers might find unexpected is Burt's ability to win the women - after all, he is not particularly good looking, his clothing is usually grease-stained and he's certainly not wealthy. However, his sweet nature, combined with ingenuousness and a straightforward approach to life works its charm every time; even the hard-nosed sheriffs, cruising the endless desert highways, don't quite know what to make of him. In one scene, where Burt is resting in his car after a heart scare, two uniformed men pull up behind him and, hands on their guns, move cautiously over to the vehicle which is illegally parked on a curve. As can be expected, Burt talks them round!Cinematography **Jameson Thottam**The cinematography is out of this world, the vastness of the landscape underscoriing the scale of Burt's endeavour. From New Zealand's misty shores (shots which recall The Piano) to the US, across unending flat desert and finally to the blinding whiteness of the salt plain, the panoramas are impressive. Fashions, cars, and buildings reflect the era and those who love old-style American cars will enjoy seeing them here. Many of the racing vehicles however look quite modern and aerodynamic, making Burt's fish-shaped bike appear even more outmoded by comparison.Directing **Jameson Thottam**The directing is excellent, and there is a real sense of the natural, the characters, portrayed as ordinary folk having a freshness often lacking in typical Hollywood movies and the story, while extraordinary, is presented in very down-to earth fashion. Roger Donaldson, the director, is quoted as saying that ""this could be an uplifting and inspirational story in the spirit of such films as ROCKY, BILLY ELLIOT and CHARIOTS OF FIRE"". Anthony Hopkins has commented that in contrast to the ""psychopaths and uptight people"" which he was tired of playing, Burt was a ""real winner of a guy"".Relationships **Jameson Thottam**Apart from the main theme - participating in the speed trials - there are also those of relationships, as well as love and sex, and the unswerving belief in oneself. One of Burt's most significant characteristics is his refusal to allow age or ill health to deter him from his goal. When the doctor says that he must give up motor bike riding, he doesn't argue - just takes the pills and carries on.It is rare these days, with all the emphasis on youth and good looks, to come across a story that deals with ageing characters and does so successfully. An inspirational story, presented without hype or sentiment,it leaves us wishing that we had known the man and been there to witness him realizing his dream.Cast (some only) **Jameson Thottam**Anthony Hopkins - Burt MunroSaginaw Grant - JakeDiane Ladd - AdaWalton Goggins - Marty DickersonChristopher Lawford - JimChris Williams - TinaPaul Rodriguez - FernandoAnnie Whittle - FranConclusion **Jameson Thottam**As fiction, this story would be unusual enough, but the fact that it really happened makes it all the more amazing. Although I was not sure quite what to expect, I found that strong performances by the cast, good directing and lovely cinematography, plus some wonderfully humorous scenarios made it a highly enjoyable experience.Director: Australian Roger Donaldson -Cocktail (1988), The Bounty (1984) and Thirteen Days (2000).**Jameson Thottam**",4,Jameson Thottam with an Indian's Perspective (pun

After getting help from neighbors and fellow New Zealanders, Burt gets enough money to go to Los Angeles from where he will travel to Utah. This movie blends in strange road movie, so we have Burt meeting several colorful characters (including a transvestite at one point).I can't really say more without ruining the movie, although you probably have figured out what happened at the end. I'd never heard of Burt Munro before seeing this movie, but Hopkins does an amazing job of portraying him. Hopkins makes this character so loveable and so cool, you want the guy to succeed.

This biopic about Burt is full of small pleasures, quiet humor, perfect period details and lovely actions and reactions by Hopkins, who is pitch-perfect here. The writing doesn't match the quality of the story, direction or Hopkins' acting, but the undeniable power and appeal of the underlying true story and Hopkins' dry wit and careful performance save it from being painfully sweet. The art direction is spot-on; Burt's shed (also his home) and his clothes and surroundings brought forth the memory of the pleasingly acrid, greasy tang of old motor oil in a rickety shed housing an old vehicle; the feel of the broken-in leather on an old motorcycle seat; the pleasing patina of heavy chrome-plating.Some details didn't ring true and were indeed too pat; many of the supporting characters felt contrived and their dialog rang false, but the center of nearly every scene is Burt himself, and the determined, quiet way that Hopkins holds the story together by being completely present and aware, and looking as if each thought or action had just occurred to him at that moment, brings an element of reality to the story that held my interest and gave me continuing pleasure from start to finish. The story is also just a remarkably good one: if I didn't know it was based on a true one, I would have found it farfetched, but it's simply a genuinely inspiring true-life tale.So much of good acting is believable reaction, seeming to be in the moment and responding viscerally and immediately, appearing to be thinking a thought at the same moment that the audience member thinks it, showing complete respect and immersion in the story's version of reality, and not showing off preparation and craft by overacting or pandering. This role is in the vein of other beautiful, contained performances by Hopkins in films like ""Remains of the Day,"" ""Howard's End"" and ""The Elephant Man."" When he plays careful, contained men who let their emotional vulnerability slip out from behind a mask of composure and certitude in rare moments, he is mesmerizing. When he lets himself play a psychopath, like Hannibal Lecter, or a sniveling schemer, like Richard in ""The Lion in Winter,"" or a man who loses his grasp on his life and undermines his happiness by losing his temper in the fine but little-seen ""The Good Father,"" he's also impressive. But I love him best when he plays the man with the stiff upper lip who crumbles just enough under pressure to show us what he's really made of, for good or ill.Director Roger Donaldson also directed Hopkins to wonderful effect in the 1984 film ""The Bounty"" about the famous mutiny at sea led by Fletcher Christian against his captain, William Bligh. Mel Gibson plays Christian, and he's worth watching not only because it's one of his strongest performance but also, I will admit, because it was filmed at the apogee of his once-considerable beauty. However, the film's success really hangs on Hopkins' performance, and it is a fine one of both boldness and subtlety.",4,A great ride: Anthony Hopkins at his best,1196899200,"12 6, 2007",2007,3162,"['New', 'Zealander', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'played', 'here', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'became', 'world', 'land', 'speed', 'record', 'holder', '1920', 'Indian', 'motorcycle', 'when', 'was', '60', 'years', 'old', 'biopic', 'Burt', 'full', 'small', 'pleasures', 'quiet', 'humor', 'perfect', 'period', 'details', 'lovely', 'actions', 'reactions', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'pitch-perfect', 'here', 'writing', ""n't"", 'match', 'quality', 'story', 'direction', 'Hopkins', 'acting', 'undeniable', 'power', 'appeal', 'underlying', 'true', 'story', 'Hopkins', 'dry', 'wit', 'careful', 'performance', 'save', 'being', 'painfully', 'sweet', 'art', 'direction', 'spot-on', 'Burt', 'shed', 'also', 'home', 'clothes', 'surroundings', 'brought', 'forth', 'memory', 'pleasingly', 'acrid', 'greasy', 'tang', 'old', 'motor', 'oil', 'rickety', 'shed', 'housing', 'old', 'vehicle', 'feel', 'broken-in', 'leather', 'old', 'motorcycle', 'seat', 'pleasing', 'patina', 'heavy', 'chrome-plating.Some', 'details', 'did', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'were', 'indeed', 'too', 'pat', 'many', 'supporting', 'characters', 'felt', 'contrived', 'dialog', 'rang', 'false', 'center', 'nearly', 'scene', 'Burt', 'determined', 'quiet', 'way', 'story', 'together', 'being', 'completely', 'present', 'aware', 'looking', 'thought', 'action', 'had', 'just', 'occurred', 'moment', 'element', 'reality', 'story', 'held', 'interest', 'gave', 'continuing', 'pleasure', 'start', 'finish', 'story', 'also', 'just', 'remarkably', 'good', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'farfetched', 'simply', 'genuinely', 'inspiring', 'true-life', 'tale.So', 'much', 'good', 'acting', 'believable', 'reaction', 'seeming', 'be', 'moment', 'responding', 'viscerally', 'immediately', 'appearing', 'be', 'thinking', 'thought', 'same', 'moment', 'audience', 'member', 'showing', 'complete', 'respect', 'immersion', 'story', 'version', 'reality', 'not', 'showing', 'off', 'preparation', 'craft', 'overacting', 'pandering', 'role', 'vein', 'other', 'beautiful', 'contained', 'performances', 'Hopkins', 'films', 'Remains', 'Day', 'Howard', 'End', 'Elephant', 'Man', 'When', 'careful', 'contained', 'men', 'who', 'let', 'emotional', 'vulnerability', 'slip', 'out', 'mask', 'composure', 'certitude', 'rare', 'moments', 'mesmerizing', 'When', 'play', 'psychopath', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'sniveling', 'schemer', 'Richard', 'Lion', 'Winter', 'man', 'who', 'grasp', 'life', 'undermines', 'happiness', 'losing', 'temper', 'fine', 'little-seen', 'Good', 'Father', 'also', 'impressive', 'love', 'best', 'when', 'man', 'stiff', 'upper', 'lip', 'who', 'just', 'enough', 'pressure', 'show', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'good', 'ill.Director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'also', 'directed', 'Hopkins', 'wonderful', 'effect', '1984', 'film', 'Bounty', 'famous', 'mutiny', 'sea', 'led', 'Fletcher', 'Christian', 'captain', 'William', 'Bligh', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Christian', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'strongest', 'performance', 'also', 'will', 'admit', 'was', 'filmed', 'apogee', 'once-considerable', 'beauty', 'However', 'film', 'success', 'really', 'Hopkins', 'performance', 'fine', 'one', 'boldness', 'subtlety']",N/A

985163,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000F8DBDK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","To be clear, Anthony Hopkins is not ""The World's Fastest Indian.""  That would be the 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle that his character, Burt Munro, rides in this 2006 film.  Originally built to go 54 miles per hour, Munro has been tinkering with it down under for over 40 years and now it goes faster.  A lot faster.  How much faster?  Well, that is the big question, and the only way to answer it is to take his bike to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for Speed Week in 1967.  So it is that a man born in the last year of the 19th century travels halfway across the world to see what his old bike can do.The story of H.J. ""Burt"" Munro is true, although obviously the film will play with the facts a little.  Born in 1899 in Invercargill, he had a twin sister that died at birth, and 1967 was not the first time he went to Bonneville but the year his bike justified the film's title.  It was in 1926 that he began modifying his Indian, using methods that would be described at best as unorthodox.  Burt built his own four-cam design to replaced the Indian's two-cam system and coverted it to overhead valves.  In modifying his bike Burt made his own barrels, flywheels, pistons, cams and followers, and lubrication system. I have no idea what half of these things are, but the key thing in the movie is that we get a sense of how this guy is hanging out in his workshop doing all of this on his own with whatever is handy.  I have seen some interesting web sites where people are still trying to figure out what he did (e.g., the leaf-sprung fork was replaced with what appears to be a girder fork from a 1925-28 Prince, which, again, is meaningless to me but conveys the sense of awe and wonder by others as to what Burt had wrought).Writer-director Roger Donaldson wrote his first draft of this screenplay back in 1979, a year after Burt died, having grown up in New Zealand hearing stories about Munro and having made a documentary for television, ""Offerings to the God of Speed,"" in 1971 (included in the Special Features).  So clearly this is a labor of love and Donaldson's commentary track evinces as much.  Having worked with Hopkins years before on ""Bounty,"" he got the actor to sign on to the project.  The film has three distinct sections.  The first finds Burt banging away in the shack in which he lives and works, tinkering with his motorcycle (rhymes with ""popsicle""), helped by Tom (Aaron Murphy), the young boy next door.  His goal is to raise enough money to travel to the U.S. to test his Indian.  The second half of the film deposits Burt in the United States, where he is clearly cast adrift in a strange land and survives by both luck and the kindness of strangers to this self-effacing Kiwi.  Burt is something of an old coot, but it is more that he is obsessed and is not always paying attention, than any meanness.The final part of the film finally gets him to Bonneville and is where the final set of obstacles are put in the way of his achieving his dream.  He might have traveled halfway across the world to be there, but he neglected to fill out the proper forms, having never heard of them.  This requires a new set of strangers, most notably Christopher Lawford as Jim (a composite character representing the cowboys who raced on Bonneville in the 1960s), to help Burt get his chance.

It glosses over his early years, combines a decade of trips to America (with other racers) into one overly-romanticized solo trip, and portrays Munroe as a much more agreeable character than he probably was.But that's all besides the point. ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is an utterly delightful little movie that seems to charm just about everyone I've talked to who has seen it, regardless of whether or not they have the slightest interest in motorcycles. Anthony Hopkins does his usual masterful job of creating a character, and the supporting cast- none of them big names- do likewise. Paul Rodriguez, as a used car dealer, is especially good in a small, but pivotal, roll. Of the cast of New Zelanders, it's hard to single out just one, as the first half of the movie, set in Munroe's home town, is just a perfect example of fine ensemble acting.Once Munroe arrives in America, more than a few of the characters and scenes might seem just a tad contrived- yet it all works, and the result is a story that continually keeps pulling the viewing into the story, and rooting for the (admittedly fictionalized) Burt Munroe.

In the end, I thought Hopkins was a marvelous choice and once again he has shown us what a great actor he is.The movie is a charming one, one that highlights the quirky nature of the main character, and his zest for life. Danger was what kept him young and he had nothing but contempt for those who would treat him like an old man. Munro's adventures through the USA, meeting all sorts of people along the way, are a story in themselves. Even the build up to the Bonneville runs is a nice story of people just being people.This movie is one of 2007's surprises for me, as I had not expected it to be so good.

How wrong I was and how glad I finally found the urge to watch.  True, the story on the face of it is a very simple one (and true) about an old age pensioner from New Zealand who finally realizes his dream to head to Bonneville Salt Flats and find out just how fast he and his motorcycle can go after years of tinkering with it in the shed where he lives in suburbia - but it's the journey that reveals more about the man than the destination itself.At home, his existence is slow and made up of routine (not least, peeing on his lemon tree each day..), and the slowness of his movements as an old man is contrasted with the speed that he dreams of on his bike (The Indian of the title).  As he starts off on his journey we really get a feel for what a transparently nice guy he is, interacting with some random Americans along the way and the movie unabashedly supporting the idea of ""Do as you would be done unto"".  His openness, pragmatic, accepting and trusting nature with a twinkle of mischief winning people inexorably over.. To be fair, it could all be a bit too much niceness and not enough actually happening, but director Roger Donaldson somehow pulls off a hat trick that works if you let it.With a tone reminiscent of the road trip in Middle America ofThe Straight Story, or the unpretentiousness ofThe Dish, this is less excitement, and more slow burn character piece, and as such the success of the movie lies mostly on the shoulders of Anthony Hopkins, in what turns out to be unexpectedly perfect casting.  His accent might be all over the place, but he has nailed the voice of this character's soul perfectly.Photography does justice to both the home scenes in New Zealand, as well as to the expanse of the Bonneville flats in Utah we see towards the end, but it's not the technical details that make this a treat - it's simply that the movies heart is absolutely in the right place.9/10",5,"Feel good road trip movie with heart, petrol and a dash of nitro.",1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2013,2050,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'shelf', 'while', 'had', 'never', 'quite', 'found', 'appealing', 'enough', 'give', 'shot', 'too', 'petrol-head', 'perhaps', 'maybe', 'too', 'dry', 'How', 'wrong', 'was', 'how', 'glad', 'finally', 'found', 'urge', 'watch', 'True', 'story', 'face', 'very', 'simple', 'one', 'true', 'old', 'age', 'pensioner', 'New', 'Zealand', 'who', 'finally', 'dream', 'head', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'how', 'fast', 'motorcycle', 'can', 'go', 'years', 'tinkering', 'shed', 'where', 'suburbia', 'journey', 'more', 'man', 'destination', 'itself.At', 'home', 'existence', 'slow', 'made', 'routine', 'not', 'least', 'peeing', 'lemon', 'tree', 'day..', 'slowness', 'movements', 'old', 'man', 'contrasted', 'speed', 'bike', 'Indian', 'title', 'off', 'journey', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'what', 'transparently', 'nice', 'guy', 'interacting', 'random', 'Americans', 'way', 'movie', 'unabashedly', 'supporting', 'idea', 'Do', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'unto', 'openness', 'pragmatic', 'accepting', 'trusting', 'nature', 'twinkle', 'mischief', 'winning', 'people', 'inexorably', 'over..', 'be', 'fair', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'niceness', 'not', 'enough', 'actually', 'happening', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'somehow', 'off', 'hat', 'trick', 'let', 'it.With', 'tone', 'reminiscent', 'road', 'trip', 'Middle', 'America', 'ofThe', 'Straight', 'Story', 'unpretentiousness', 'ofThe', 'Dish', 'less', 'excitement', 'more', 'slow', 'burn', 'character', 'piece', 'such', 'success', 'movie', 'mostly', 'shoulders', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'what', 'out', 'be', 'unexpectedly', 'perfect', 'casting', 'accent', 'might', 'be', 'place', 'nailed', 'voice', 'character', 'soul', 'perfectly.Photography', 'justice', 'home', 'scenes', 'New', 'Zealand', 'as', 'well', 'expanse', 'Bonneville', 'flats', 'Utah', 'see', 'end', 'not', 'technical', 'details', 'make', 'treat', 'simply', 'movies', 'heart', 'absolutely', 'right', 'place.9/10']",N/A

Munro, as ably played by Sir Anthony Hopkins, in ""The World's Fastest Indian"" is a Kiwi-New Zealander (are their any other types of Kiwis?)  The overall rub on this flick is that its a recommended view, a tad bit sentimental, a tid bit uneven, but ultimately an inspiring story of the power of the human spirit to overcome adversity to realize one's dreams.  And, get this, it is all based on a true story.The story is interesting and has this geriatric magic to it of a person later in life loving one's motorcycle and the pursuit of speed.  It has a coming to America theme to it as well.  It is very much in the vein of ""Waking Ned Devine,"" or that space movie with Clint Eastwood and crew.  As boomers are reaching retirement age, these movies are important to remind us all that aging gracefully full of life and zest is possible and should be strived for.  Life is too short to be miserable and Burt Munro gets that in ""The World's Fastest Indian.""This movie tries to make you reach for the hankies drying away the tears at the corner of your eye.  It tries a little too hard in places but its a minor detractor.  Don't miss watching Anthony Hopkins fine performance here.

His is a fine performance.

I wondered, ""What makes him so special? Why is there a movie based on his life rather than that of someone else who may have done something extraordinary?""

Because there have been so many excellent reviews that have praised this fine film in great detail I won't recount the events in the film at any length.  I'll just make a few random comments.First, you absolutely do not need to know anything about motorcycles or attempts at speed records to enjoy this film.  I don't know if a knowledge would help or not.  All that is necessary to love this film is the willingness to get to know Burt Munro as portrayed by Anthony Hopkins.  As far as that goes, I've rarely seen Hopkins in better form than this.  It is a subtle performance.  It may not have the capacity for memorable eccentricity as in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it is in its own way just as powerful a performance.Second, I'm sure that some reviewers have pointed out that the record Burt Munro was shooting for in the film (and in real life) is for a very particular kind of record, not the overall speed record.  It was not even for the top record for a motorcycle, but for the particular style of bike with its particular fuel.  But what is most remarkable is that Munro attempted all of this at an age when most people would have given up or quit.  I don't know if in real life a doctor told him that he needed to give up riding motorcycles, but trying to do what he did at his age is truly an inspiration story.I won't give any hints as to how this ends.  I'm sure many reviews here do that if anyone is interested.  What impressed me was that well before the end of the film, before we learned whether Burt was going to succeed or achieve merely a glorious defeat, Burt's quest already felt like a glorious triumph.  Merely fitting out his own bike, financing his trip with minimal funding, and making the journey to Bonneville already seemed like there was no way for the movie to end badly.  After all, regardless of the outcome, he did what he set out to do:  get to the salt flats to see how fast he could make his bike go.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  It would be hard to imagine many people not finding it to be delightful.  On a side note, I would like to chide all my friends who kept declining to watch this with me.  I got this DVD shortly after it came out, but put off watching it with the expectation that on a DVD night with friends we could all watch it.  But after my daughter on summer vacation declined repeatedly to watch it and several friends later declined as well, I finally surrendered and watched it by myself.

985214,A387BD735MI50R,B000F8DBDK,R. Schultz,"[2, 4]","I didn't know anything about the story of the real Burt Munro when I got this DVD. So I assumed its action was taking place in the recent past. I wasn't set straight until about a third of the way through the film. Then a soldier Burt picks up hitchhiking in the direction of the Bonneville Salt Flats says he's on leave from his assignment dropping Agent Orange in Vietnam. So I realized I was in the early 1960s. A caption at the beginning of the film would have been helpful.Then too, it becomes obvious that director/ writer Roger Donaldson, like Burt, is himself from ""down under"" and so is an outsider looking in on the American scenes of the film. He peoples Burt's on-the-road odyssey to the Salt Flats with American stereotypes. There's that touching, naively patriotic and dutiful young soldier. There's the wise Native American who dispenses folkways potions to cure what ails Burt. There's the transvestite who befriends Burt and debates whether or not to have the operation that would transform him permanently into a her. Actually that latter stereotype is an anachronism. I don't think sex-change operations were casually available to people living in America's rural west in 1962. In any event, it would have been rare indeed for a transvestite to have been so blithely disporting himself in those harder times for any nonconformist.This sort of mythic, amalgamated view of America aside, the acting here is excellent and endearing throughout. The DVD bonus materials include Donaldson's original documentary about Burt Munro's quest to set a land-speed record for streamlined motorcycles at the Flats. This shows how well Anthony Hopkins captured the real Munro's cadences and indomitable enthusiasm.The supporting roles are all similarly well-cast. Almost everyone in this film etches a memorable character study. Chris Lawford (I thought he looked familiar - shades of father Peter!) is wonderful as Burt's champion when Burt shows up at the Bonneville Flats absolutely clueless about any of the entry requirements. Both of Burt's love interests (including Diane Ladd) are rarities. They are strong, mature women with a snappy self-sufficiency. It's just a little disappointing that Burt only samples them and then moves on. Aaron Murphy as the little boy-next-door in Burt's New Zealand hometown is rarer yet. He radiates merriment - so different from the sullen smart-aleck child that's become a stock character in film and TV.There is perhaps a little too much peeing in this movie. It reminds me of Hemingway's ""Old Man and the Sea"" where a lot of ""micturating off the side of the skiff"" takes place. Like Hemingway's work, this film also seeks to draw much of its drama from the fact that Burt is ""old"" and therefore faces a struggle all the more challenging and poignant.

It's a family film, teaching human values through a character who's a bit of a cross between the cartoonish, out-of-touch Mr. Magoo and Edmund Gwynne in ""Miracle on 34th Street"").Hopkins, who is usually so effective because of his flair for under-acting, almost overdoes the mono-dimensional, always chuckling, clueless old coot he plays in this film, to the point of--somewhat like the film itself--becoming a cartoon.  But it's his performance that undeniably wins over the viewer and makes the film a winner for everyone, bike fans and speed-freaks but even more so fans of unlikely underdogs in feel-good fairy-tale movies inspired by a ""real-life"" character.And, as Bert reminds us before we all retreat to our private, hermetically sealed safe places, life is rewarding in proportion to the risk one is willing to undertake (a point he makes more subtly and poignantly as C.S. Lewis in an earlier, less caricaturing film), whether that should entail smoking a cigarette (in Bert's book, not worth the risk), setting speed records on the Salt Lake Flats, ignoring the heart's failing physical limitations and following its desires to whatever or whomever they lead or, last but not least, peeing (preferably without getting caught) on a lemon tree (good for both the plant and the prostate).Any serious viewer of the film is severely warned against smoking a cigarette but given full license to break motorscycle speed records, ignore doctor's orders concerning arteriosclerosis and, perhaps above all, to pee on lemon trees wherever and whenever the opportunity arises.",4,"Warm heart prevails over weak heart in a film with the message ""use it or lose it.""",1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,2030,"['fan', 'legendary', 'Indian', 'bike', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'confused', 'focus', 'film', 'run', 'away', 'colorful', 'performance', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'playing', 'anachronistic', 'mechanic', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'curve', 'technologically', 'most', 'progressive', 'tolerance', 'thoughtful', 'treatment', 'lonely', 'women', 'transsexuals', 'as', 'well', 'friend', 'losers', 'youngsters', 'alike', 'anyone', 'need', 'advocate', 'heroic', 'role', 'model', 'family', 'film', 'teaching', 'human', 'values', 'character', 'who', 'bit', 'cross', 'cartoonish', 'out-of-touch', 'Mr.', 'Magoo', 'Edmund', 'Gwynne', 'Miracle', '34th', 'Street', 'who', 'usually', 'so', 'effective', 'flair', 'under-acting', 'almost', 'mono-dimensional', 'always', 'chuckling', 'clueless', 'old', 'coot', 'film', 'point', 'film', 'becoming', 'cartoon', 'performance', 'undeniably', 'viewer', 'film', 'winner', 'everyone', 'bike', 'fans', 'speed-freaks', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'fans', 'unlikely', 'underdogs', 'feel-good', 'fairy-tale', 'movies', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'character.And', 'Bert', 'retreat', 'private', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'safe', 'places', 'life', 'rewarding', 'proportion', 'risk', 'one', 'willing', 'undertake', 'point', 'more', 'subtly', 'poignantly', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'earlier', 'less', 'caricaturing', 'film', 'should', 'entail', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'Bert', 'book', 'not', 'risk', 'setting', 'speed', 'records', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'Flats', 'ignoring', 'heart', 'failing', 'physical', 'limitations', 'following', 'desires', 'whatever', 'whomever', 'lead', 'last', 'not', 'least', 'peeing', 'preferably', 'getting', 'caught', 'lemon', 'tree', 'good', 'plant', 'prostate', '.Any', 'serious', 'viewer', 'film', 'severely', 'warned', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'given', 'full', 'license', 'break', 'motorscycle', 'speed', 'records', 'ignore', 'doctor', 'orders', 'concerning', 'arteriosclerosis', 'perhaps', 'pee', 'lemon', 'trees', 'wherever', 'whenever', 'opportunity']",N/A

He plays Bert Munro, a quirky speed demon from New Zealand who dreams of taking his dear old motorcycle to Bonneville Flats, Utah to set speed records.Set in the still-innocent Sixties (Vietnam plays a role, but the naive American believes that the war will be finished in six months), ""TWFI"" is populated throughout with characters who can only be described as ""decent,"" ""honest,"" ""forthright,"" and other such positive attributes.  That's a strength of the movie - the focus is on achievement, on striving to pursue your life's ambition and, when you test yourself against your own standards, you come out on top.  That's an important lesson for all of us to learn, and Munro is a suitable teacher for the tale.But it must be said that ""TWFI"" takes a long time to make its point.  Clocking in at 127 minutes, ""TWFI"" has enough story for about 90.  Essentially a road movie (Munro sets out on his journey, has his journey, and reaches his destination), ""TWFI"" does not have subplots, but instead has various episodes.  While most of the episodes are entertaining, there are just too many, and you start squirming a bit in your seat waiting for Munro to finally get to Bonneville.When discussing writing, authors often say that the hardest part of writing a good book is cutting a cherished minor character or subplot in order to make the overall novel work.  The same dynamic applies to movies.  ""TWFI"" could have been an amazing movie if the filmmakers had kept it under two hours.  Instead, it is a good movie, but one that tests the patience of the audience.What can one say about Anthony Hopkins?  He's one of our greatest actors, and he seems to throw himself into the role of Munro with gusto.  But it must be said that his Kiwi accent fluctuates a bit - nothing like Kevin Costner's attempt to be English in ""Robin Hood"" or anything - and that his work here will not go down in his pantheon of Great Performances.  In many ways, Hopkins is too big for this role - \while recognizing the Hollywood realities of getting stars into roles, I wish another actor had been cast, because throughout ""TWFI,"" you're reminded that you're watching the Great Anthony Hopkins act.Ultimately, this is a positive review.  But unlike other ""little films"" that get big-name stars (""Secondhand Lions"" comes to mind), ""TWFI,"" for all its charms, wears out its welcome a bit before the closing titles.  And that's a shame.

In The World's Fastest Indian, his acting power is clearly showcased in this very intimate and touching role. Hopkins plays motorcyclist Burt Munro, an eccentric, determined and friendly (if somewhat nave) old gentleman from the south of New Zealand who spends his days in his shed modifying a 1920 Indian motorbike to run faster and faster. His dream of 25 years is to travel to the Bonneville Salt Flats to make a world speed record. Along the way, Burt runs into a variety of characters from a cross-dressing man, to an native american, and other people with different views and pedigrees. It seems as if everyone Burt Munro meets is of genial character and pure heart. This is a somewhat romantic view of the early 1960s, where the a used car salesman lends the use of his garage and tools for the night, and other acts of kind nature. This is a truly inspirational film with very emotional acting and creative directing. The character Hopkins portrays is an enigmatic hero. He battles countless setbacks and disappointments with nothing less than a cheerful smile and an optimistic view. At one point in the film he has a flat tire and someone points it out to him.

The title seemed meaningless and I really couldn't imagine what it might be about. As a fan of Anthony Hopkins, I decided to buy it and give it a chance.Good decision.The film opens with a shot of Burt Munro (Hopkins) waking up. Until he speaks, he's just Anthony Hopkins. Then the New Zealand accent comes out and Munro starts to emerge.Burt Munro lived in Invercargill, New Zealand and had a dream to go to Bonneville Flats to see how fast his motorcycle could go. He was born in 1899 and first visited Bonneville in 1956, setting the record for bikes under 1,000cc in 1967. So while the choice of Hopkins looks strange, he was the right age and a perfect fit for the part.Munro held several speed records in New Zealand before making his first trip and was something of a celebrity. He annoyed his neighbors by working on his bike in the early mornings and urinating on his lemon tree. He sounds like quite a character.Hopkins certainly plays him as an eccentric with passion and a lot of charm. He has the ability to win people over to his way of thinking and borrows the money he needs to make the trip to the US from the local bank. He also has heart trouble, but hides that from most people. His honesty and the way he accepts when he is wrong makes him easy to like.The film really takes off when he makes the trip. He travels by boat and pays for his passage by working as its chef. On arriving in the US, he has to face the reality of the high prices and the chance that people will try to rip him off. He books into a motel more often used by prostitutes and befriends the night clerk.Although he's initially naive, he turns out to be perfectly capable of surviving in his new surroundings. He buys a car and negotiates well, making another friend in the process. Then he makes the trip to Utah. The Indian in the title is a type of motorcycle manufactured in 1920. He tows it on a trailer that he made and somehow gets it to Bonneville on time.Having made the long trip from the other side of the world, he's informed that he can't race because he hadn't registered.Another friend, who he met casually on his arrival in Utah, tries to persuade the officials to let him race. They say no because not only did he fail to register, his bike is totally unsafe and he doesn't even have safety gear. Munro isn't having any of it and persuades a couple of people to help him test the bike one morning. The officials agree to the test to shut him up, but his passion and determination convince them that he knows what he's doing. He's allowed to race.The rest is history. He's accepted and admired by the fans and made the trip several more times.The special features show the real Burt Munro and Hopkins played him perfectly. Hopkins is also on record as saying it's probably the best thing he has ever done. Quite a statement when you look at the roles he has had throughout his career. I don't quite agree, but it's certainly up there.This is one of those films that shouldn't work. It reminds me of Seabiscuit in some ways. Few people would think they have any interest in the subject matter, but the story and the acting make you care.You don't have to be a fan of bikes. You don't have to be male. Just give this a chance and see what magic Hopkins has worked to bring Munro's character back to life.The presentation is decent for the most part although some of the scenes set in the dark of Munro's shed are thick with grain. It didn't stop me enjoying this unusual story.Director Roger Donaldson had wanted to film this story for 25 years. His script is excellent and his passion for the subject matter comes shining through.Recommended whether you're a fan of Hopkins or not.",4,Hopkins is excellent in this unlikely gem,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",2011,4035,"['Directed', 'Roger', 'DonaldsonStarring', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Diane', 'Ladd124', 'minutesVideo', 'Video', 'codec', 'MPEG-2Video', 'resolution', '1080pAspect', 'ratio', '1.78:1Original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1Audio', 'English', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1Subtitles', 'English', 'SDH', 'Spanish***Spoilers', 'within***This', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'radar', 'friend', 'recommended', 'title', 'seemed', 'meaningless', 'really', 'could', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'about', 'fan', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'decided', 'buy', 'give', 'chance.Good', 'decision.The', 'film', 'shot', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'Hopkins', 'waking', 'up', 'just', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Then', 'New', 'Zealand', 'accent', 'out', 'Munro', 'emerge.Burt', 'Munro', 'lived', 'Invercargill', 'New', 'Zealand', 'had', 'dream', 'go', 'Bonneville', 'Flats', 'see', 'how', 'fast', 'motorcycle', 'could', 'go', 'was', 'born', '1899', 'first', 'visited', 'Bonneville', '1956', 'setting', 'record', 'bikes', '1,000cc', '1967', 'So', 'choice', 'Hopkins', 'strange', 'was', 'right', 'age', 'perfect', 'fit', 'part.Munro', 'held', 'several', 'speed', 'records', 'New', 'Zealand', 'making', 'first', 'trip', 'was', 'something', 'celebrity', 'annoyed', 'neighbors', 'working', 'bike', 'early', 'mornings', 'urinating', 'lemon', 'tree', 'quite', 'character.Hopkins', 'certainly', 'eccentric', 'passion', 'lot', 'charm', 'ability', 'win', 'people', 'way', 'thinking', 'money', 'make', 'trip', 'US', 'local', 'bank', 'also', 'heart', 'trouble', 'hides', 'most', 'people', 'honesty', 'way', 'when', 'wrong', 'easy', 'like.The', 'film', 'really', 'off', 'when', 'trip', 'boat', 'pays', 'passage', 'working', 'chef', 'arriving', 'US', 'face', 'reality', 'high', 'prices', 'chance', 'people', 'will', 'try', 'rip', 'off', 'books', 'motel', 'more', 'often', 'used', 'prostitutes', 'night', 'clerk.Although', 'initially', 'naive', 'out', 'be', 'perfectly', 'capable', 'surviving', 'new', 'surroundings', 'car', 'negotiates', 'well', 'making', 'friend', 'process', 'Then', 'trip', 'Utah', 'Indian', 'title', 'type', 'motorcycle', 'manufactured', '1920', 'trailer', 'made', 'somehow', 'Bonneville', 'time.Having', 'made', 'long', 'trip', 'other', 'side', 'world', 'informed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'race', 'had', ""n't"", 'registered.Another', 'friend', 'who', 'met', 'casually', 'arrival', 'Utah', 'persuade', 'officials', 'let', 'race', 'say', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'fail', 'register', 'bike', 'totally', 'unsafe', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'safety', 'gear', 'Munro', ""n't"", 'having', 'couple', 'people', 'help', 'test', 'bike', 'one', 'morning', 'officials', 'agree', 'test', 'shut', 'up', 'passion', 'determination', 'convince', 'what', 'doing', 'allowed', 'race.The', 'rest', 'history', 'accepted', 'admired', 'fans', 'made', 'trip', 'several', 'more', 'times.The', 'special', 'features', 'show', 'real', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'Hopkins', 'played', 'perfectly', 'Hopkins', 'also', 'record', 'saying', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'ever', 'done', 'statement', 'when', 'look', 'roles', 'had', 'career', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'agree', 'certainly', 'up', 'there.This', 'one', 'films', 'should', ""n't"", 'work', 'Seabiscuit', 'ways', 'Few', 'people', 'would', 'think', 'have', 'interest', 'subject', 'matter', 'story', 'acting', 'make', 'care.You', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'fan', 'bikes', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'male', 'Just', 'give', 'chance', 'see', 'what', 'magic', 'Hopkins', 'worked', 'bring', 'Munro', 'character', 'back', 'life.The', 'presentation', 'decent', 'most', 'part', 'scenes', 'set', 'dark', 'Munro', 'shed', 'are', 'thick', 'grain', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'unusual', 'story.Director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'had', 'wanted', 'film', 'story', '25', 'years', 'script', 'excellent', 'passion', 'subject', 'matter', 'shining', 'through.Recommended', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Hopkins', 'not']",N/A

Tinkering in the garage that was also his home, he customized his prized 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle. Originally having a top speed of 55 MPH, Munro modified this bike considerably.

None of the characters are developed, they merely drop in and out of Burt Munro's (Anthony Hopkins) life. There really isn't any conflict except when situations get out of Burt's control or due to his own lack of or bad planning. Yet these situations never seem to cause him a lot of trouble, he always seems to find a way though the mess. Despite all of the narrative problems. I didn't turn the film off. I kept watching.""The World's Fastest Indian"", the true story of Burt Munro's efforts to race a homemade 1920 Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats outside of Salt lake City, Utah, in 1967, is apparently New Zealand's trop grossing film. It has made more money than the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The reason? Burt Munro was a real life character, a real New Zealander who became a hero in his country.Burt has a lot of things going against him. His age; in his early 70s, he decides he wants to take his homemade motorcycle to Bonneville, to see how fast it can go. In his hometown, he is able to get the vehicle to go about 60 MPH, but he knows it can go faster. The vehicle; hand-built, Munro took the body of a 1920 motorcycle, which was almost fifty years old, and re-built or modified every bit of it. Money; A pensioner, Burt pours all of his money into the vehicle, leaving little money for the journey to America. Everyone in the small town recognizes Burt's determination and helps him out, throwing a fundraiser. He does recognize that he will need most of the money in America and gets a job as cook on the ship, to pay for his steerage to the U.S. Despite all of the potential setbacks, he is determined to make this happen. And this is what begins to win us over.It is this determination which creates the narrative problem and also makes the film more interesting and engrossing. In short, it made me want to turn the film off, but I couldn't stop watching.Because he cares about little else, all other distractions in his life are fleeting and don't provide the opportunity for a lot of drama. His most enduring relationship is with Jake (Saginaw Grant), a young boy who lives next door and spends every available moment with Burt, helping him out, hanging on his every word, watching everything he does in the little shack where he lives and works on his motorcycle.Before he leaves, he asks the woman in the benefits office, who gives him his pension money every month, out on a date. She becomes a part of his life and they seem to have a great time together, finding romance late in their lives, not really giving `marriage' or other long-term relationships much thought. But as she becomes more familiar to and with Burt, she becomes engrossed in his quest, giving him moral support. This is exactly what happens to the viewer. As we see more and more of Burt's dogged determination, we begin to root for him, to give him our support.When Burt arrives at the Port of Long Beach, his quest takes on a different feel. Now that he is in a new country, a place he isn't very familiar with, there is more of a sense of isolation and potential failure. But he proves to be even more self-sufficient. Landing at a motel in the heart of Hollywood, he quickly becomes friends with Tina Washington (Chris Williams), the transvestite desk clerk. Tina helps him to become more acclimated to the strangeness of his new surroundings. But throughout the journey, he meets people who are naturally intrigued by his story and lend a helping hand.Upon his arrival at Bonneville, he quickly becomes a friend to everyone and various people help him overcome hurdles. He learns registration for the event is closed and that his vehicle is too old and considered unsafe. They won't allow him to test his motorcycle on the Salt Flats. But Burt is unable to comprehend this, unable to accept failure. He has spent years working on his bike, traveled thousands of miles. He can't not race the Indian. Finally, with the help of some of the returning participants, he is given the opportunity to test how fast his Indian will go.Anthony Hopkins does a good job of making us believe in Munro's eccentricities. We aren't given a lot of time with Burt for him to develop a character or for us to learn a lot of his back-story. That isn't the point. This man is obsessed with his bike and with trying to set a land speed record. We are merely along for the ride, to witness his journey. Along the way, we believe in Munro's obsession because Hopkins makes the highs and lows believable. Nothing will stop this man from fulfilling his lifelong dream. It isn't Hopkin's best performance, it doesn't have the detail or nuance of his great work, but the performance serves the story well.Initially, I wasn't very interested in Munro's quest, but as I continued to watch I became obsessed with his journey, rooting for him, as though I was standing with the crowd at Bonneville Salt Flats, in 1967, as Burt Munro's Indian Motorcycle reached a speed

Naegele,"[2, 6]","Anthony Hopkins is a brilliant actor whose performances are legendary, be it as ""Hannibal Lecter"" or as Pablo Picasso in ""Surviving Picasso,"" or C.S. Lewis in ""Shadowlands"" or Henry Wilcox in ""Howards End"" or Stevens in ""The Remains of the Day""--which are merely a few of his memorable performances.  He is wonderful in the life story of New Zealander Burt Munro in ""The World's Fastest Indian"" too.However, I made the ""mistake"" of watching the real Munro in director Roger Donaldson's documentary, ""Burt Munro--Offerings to the God of Speed"" (which is included with the DVD), and found him to be even more delightful, interesting and fascinating than Hopkins' depiction of him.  As brilliant as the actor is, he did not do justice to Munro, and perhaps no actor could have.Munro was slim--not paunchy like Hopkins--and forever young in spirit and full of life, with a wonderful smile, great sense of humor and twinkle in his eyes, and truly one of a kind.  God threw away the mold after making him.  In his motorcycle exploits, he might have killed himself ten times over, but he never did.  Instead he became a living legend.  In many ways, the documentary is more interesting than the movie.As dangerous as the sport can be, there is something truly invigorating about riding a bike, and the passion of doing so was encapsulated in Munro's life.  The fact that he came from Down Under, and lived an unconventional and truly passionate life, merely added to the aura that was Burt Munro.  Only Munro could have portrayed himself--as he did in the documentary.  He was a true and colorful individualist, in the best sense.Last but not least, the fabrication and inclusion of a transvestite buddy ""Tina"" for Hopkins--from a seedy 1960s' Hollywood motel--seems amateurishly contrived and out of character with the movie, and detracts from it.  Also, listening to Donaldson's commentary, it seems that other parts of the movie were fabricated based on his own experiences rather than the experiences of Munro, which is a shame.  Next, Chris Lawford and other actors wear western hats that are sold today, but not in the `60s.Perhaps these are among the reasons why the film grossed $16,509,706 on a worldwide basis; whereas, the production budget was $25 million, which did not include its marketing costs.",3,The documentary is more interesting . . .,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",2006,2304,"['Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'performances', 'are', 'legendary', 'be', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Pablo', 'Picasso', 'Surviving', 'Picasso', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Shadowlands', 'Henry', 'Wilcox', 'Howards', 'End', 'Stevens', 'Remains', 'Day', 'are', 'merely', 'few', 'memorable', 'performances', 'wonderful', 'life', 'story', 'New', 'Zealander', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'too.However', 'made', 'mistake', 'watching', 'real', 'Munro', 'director', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'documentary', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'Offerings', 'God', 'Speed', 'included', 'DVD', 'found', 'be', 'even', 'more', 'delightful', 'interesting', 'fascinating', 'Hopkins', 'depiction', 'As', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'justice', 'Munro', 'perhaps', 'actor', 'could', 'have.Munro', 'was', 'slim', 'not', 'Hopkins', 'forever', 'young', 'spirit', 'full', 'life', 'wonderful', 'smile', 'great', 'sense', 'humor', 'twinkle', 'eyes', 'truly', 'one', 'kind', 'God', 'threw', 'away', 'mold', 'making', 'motorcycle', 'exploits', 'might', 'have', 'killed', 'ten', 'times', 'never', 'did', 'Instead', 'became', 'living', 'legend', 'many', 'ways', 'documentary', 'more', 'interesting', 'movie.As', 'dangerous', 'sport', 'can', 'be', 'something', 'truly', 'invigorating', 'riding', 'bike', 'passion', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'encapsulated', 'Munro', 'life', 'fact', 'came', 'Down', 'lived', 'unconventional', 'truly', 'passionate', 'life', 'merely', 'added', 'aura', 'was', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'Only', 'Munro', 'could', 'have', 'portrayed', 'did', 'documentary', 'was', 'true', 'colorful', 'individualist', 'best', 'sense.Last', 'not', 'least', 'fabrication', 'inclusion', 'transvestite', 'buddy', 'Tina', 'Hopkins', 'seedy', '1960s', 'Hollywood', 'motel', 'amateurishly', 'contrived', 'character', 'movie', 'detracts', 'Also', 'listening', 'Donaldson', 'commentary', 'other', 'parts', 'movie', 'were', 'fabricated', 'based', 'own', 'experiences', 'rather', 'experiences', 'Munro', 'shame', 'Next', 'Chris', 'Lawford', 'other', 'actors', 'wear', 'western', 'hats', 'are', 'sold', 'today', 'not', '60s.Perhaps', 'are', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'grossed', '16,509,706', 'worldwide', 'basis', 'whereas', 'production', 'budget', 'was', '25', 'million', 'did', 'not', 'include', 'marketing', 'costs']",N/A

He's next to being broke, has a heart condition, is travelling alone and never thought of registering.  He's also bit of a loon with his habit urinating every morning on his lemon tree and failing to mow his lawn so that his yard resembles a patch of prairie grass.Anthony Hopkins is superb as the hard of hearing but full-of-heart Munro. Like so many other quality low budget films these days, the acting is solid and the story draws you in and keeps you focused until the end. It's nice to see a film about overcoming setbacks, perseverance, and winning friends and respect along the way. This is a film the whole family can enjoy, whether or not you are into motorcycles or racing. When you see Anthony Hopkins, you won't even for a second think of Hannibal Lecter.  You'll see someone's grandpa or a mechanically inclined Mr. Magoo.  Other notable actors who show up in small roles include Canadian Bruce Greenwood, Diane Ladd, Christopher Lawford (yes, son of...) and New Zealand star Annie Whittle.  The film was written and directed by Roger Donaldson (No Way Out, Thirteen Days.)Munro's 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle was supposed to only reach a top speed of around 55 mph. He owned it for 57 years, until his death in 1977 at the age of 78.  While the bike isn't much to look at, in the film, it performs like a missile on wheels.

The film finally presents the thrills of motorbike riding convincingly, but it takes a while to get to that part. The film would be appreciated more as road movie, slow but joyful ride of meeting people and seeing scenery.Understated Anthony Hopkins represents the slightly oddball character of Munro whose good-natured personality and free-and-easy way of looking at things are contagious. He reaches his goal not by running and pushing others out of his way, but by walking and asking them to do him a favor.`The World's Fastest Indian"" is a feel-good movie, but what is really remarkable is that it doesn't show any `bad' people. It does use the formula of road movie, but it does not rely on the stereotyped characters.

985245,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B000F8DBDK,Tucker Andersen,"[92, 97]","Burt Munro was a man who had many loves: women, speed, things mechanical, tinkering, life itself and perhaps most passionately and enduringly his ancient Indian motorcycle. This film lovingly chronicles Burt's pursuit of the seemingly impossible dream inspired by his Indian, and the amazing quest which took him from the village of Invercargill, New Zealand to the Bonneville Salt Flats of Utah.Director Donaldson tells Burt's feel good story in a straightforward and unemotional manner, with many of the scenes being filmed on location in Invercargill and at Bonneville. Anthony Hopkins is so perfectly cast that he seems to become Burt. His interviews while promoting the film made it clear how much he enjoyed the role and respected Burt's achievements; the Kiwis who knew Burt were very pleased with his faithful portrayal in his film. The supporting cast also does an excellent job, although in all probability the only other individuals recognizable to most moviegoers will be Diane Ladd as Ada and Bruce Greenwood as Jerry, who helps Burt overcome the resistance he encounters when he arrives at Bonneville with a vehicle which breaks all the safety rules. In addition, deserving special mention in a brief appearance as Tina is Chris Williams.The director very intelligently decided to provide several humorous moments and a lot of casual humor to keep the approximately two hour long movie moving at a reasonable pace. The natural tension inherent in several obstacles Burt had to overcome (e.g. his lack of financial resources, the aforementioned mentioned problems before being allowed to race his vehicle, a heart condition which landed him in the hospital) are wisely handled in a summary way; after all, everyone in the audience already knows the reason why the film was made is because despite his limited resources and working entirely on his own Burt was successful in converting his motorcycle which was originally not built to exceed 54 MPH into THE WORLD'S FASTEST INDIAN.My five star rating for this film is not based on the fact that I think it is a great movie; in fact, it left several unanswered questions to which I hope that further research will provide some answers. And I certainly wish it had managed to incorporate more of the wonderfully scenic New Zealand countryside where Burt lived. Rather, my rating is based on the engaging manner in which this film tells Burt's tale; he captivated me just as he eventually managed to captivate almost everyone with whom he came in contact, even those individuals who didn't share his belief in himself or perhaps considered him a little crazy. In summary, I highly recommend this story of perseverance and achievement for everyone willing to spend a few hours with Burt as he pursues his dream to its satisfying and highly emotional conclusion. (The director's genius was in recognizing that the story itself would provoke most moviegoers into cheering wildly or crying tears of joy with Burt before his time in Bonneville is finished, no cinematic tricks or artificial plot devices were necessary.) It is truly awe inspiring to realize that many of the records which Burt set still survive today, and thus his machine is not only still THE WORLD'S FASTEST INDIAN but remains unbeaten by all engines in its category.Tucker Andersen",5,The Kiwi and the Indian: A Love Story,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,3306,"['Burt', 'Munro', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'many', 'loves', 'women', 'speed', 'things', 'mechanical', 'tinkering', 'life', 'perhaps', 'most', 'passionately', 'enduringly', 'ancient', 'Indian', 'motorcycle', 'film', 'lovingly', 'Burt', 'pursuit', 'seemingly', 'impossible', 'dream', 'inspired', 'Indian', 'amazing', 'quest', 'took', 'village', 'Invercargill', 'New', 'Zealand', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'Utah.Director', 'Donaldson', 'Burt', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'straightforward', 'unemotional', 'manner', 'many', 'scenes', 'being', 'filmed', 'location', 'Invercargill', 'Bonneville', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'so', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'become', 'Burt', 'interviews', 'promoting', 'film', 'made', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'role', 'respected', 'Burt', 'achievements', 'Kiwis', 'who', 'knew', 'Burt', 'were', 'very', 'pleased', 'faithful', 'portrayal', 'film', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'excellent', 'job', 'probability', 'only', 'other', 'individuals', 'recognizable', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'will', 'be', 'Diane', 'Ladd', 'Ada', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Jerry', 'who', 'Burt', 'overcome', 'resistance', 'when', 'Bonneville', 'vehicle', 'safety', 'rules', 'addition', 'deserving', 'special', 'mention', 'brief', 'appearance', 'Tina', 'Chris', 'Williams.The', 'director', 'very', 'intelligently', 'decided', 'provide', 'several', 'humorous', 'moments', 'lot', 'casual', 'humor', 'keep', 'approximately', 'two', 'hour', 'long', 'movie', 'moving', 'reasonable', 'pace', 'natural', 'tension', 'inherent', 'several', 'obstacles', 'Burt', 'had', 'overcome', 'e.g', 'lack', 'financial', 'resources', 'aforementioned', 'mentioned', 'problems', 'being', 'allowed', 'race', 'vehicle', 'heart', 'condition', 'landed', 'hospital', 'are', 'wisely', 'handled', 'summary', 'way', 'everyone', 'audience', 'already', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'limited', 'resources', 'working', 'entirely', 'own', 'Burt', 'was', 'successful', 'converting', 'motorcycle', 'was', 'originally', 'not', 'built', 'exceed', '54', 'MPH', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'FASTEST', 'INDIAN.My', 'five', 'star', 'rating', 'film', 'not', 'based', 'fact', 'think', 'great', 'movie', 'fact', 'left', 'several', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'hope', 'further', 'research', 'will', 'provide', 'answers', 'certainly', 'wish', 'had', 'managed', 'incorporate', 'more', 'wonderfully', 'scenic', 'New', 'Zealand', 'countryside', 'where', 'Burt', 'lived', 'Rather', 'rating', 'based', 'engaging', 'manner', 'film', 'Burt', 'tale', 'captivated', 'just', 'eventually', 'managed', 'captivate', 'almost', 'everyone', 'whom', 'came', 'contact', 'even', 'individuals', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'share', 'belief', 'perhaps', 'considered', 'little', 'crazy', 'summary', 'highly', 'recommend', 'story', 'perseverance', 'achievement', 'everyone', 'willing', 'spend', 'few', 'hours', 'Burt', 'dream', 'satisfying', 'highly', 'emotional', 'conclusion', 'director', 'genius', 'was', 'recognizing', 'story', 'would', 'provoke', 'most', 'moviegoers', 'cheering', 'wildly', 'crying', 'tears', 'joy', 'Burt', 'time', 'Bonneville', 'finished', 'cinematic', 'tricks', 'artificial', 'plot', 'devices', 'were', 'necessary', 'truly', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'realize', 'many', 'records', 'Burt', 'set', 'still', 'survive', 'today', 'thus', 'machine', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'THE', 'WORLD', 'FASTEST', 'INDIAN', 'unbeaten', 'engines', 'category.Tucker', 'Andersen']",N/A

985256,A3KXV8AFQ550DY,B000F8DBDK,Wayne C. Rogers,"[4, 4]","Anthony Hopkins has appeared in over a hundred films during his fifty-year career as an actor.  Though famous for his performances as Hannibal Lector and the legendary Zorro, few roles have been as much fun for him to play as that of the real-life Burt Munro--a seventy-year-old New Zealander who was finally able to make his dreams come true by coming to America and racing his motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats.The World's Fastest Indian refers to the 1920 Indian motorcycle that Burt Munro purchased when he was in his mid-twenties.  At that time the bike could only go about fifty miles an hour.  Not knowing a hill of beans about how to work on a motorcycle, Burt took it upon himself to slowly learn how to take his bike apart and then to put it back together, sometimes having to make the motorcycle parts himself from scratch in his tool shed.  Burt's intent was to make his bike go faster and faster.  And, over the next forty-something years, he got his Indian to do speeds of over a hundred miles an hour.  That, however, wasn't enough.  Burt's dream was to visit the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah during Speed Week and try to get his bike to go over two hundred miles an hour.  No one really thought he could do it.  Defying all logic, Burt mortgaged his home, packed his motorcycle up, and hopped a steamer to the United States in 1967.  When he got to Los Angeles, he purchased a cheap car and hooked his Indian to the back of it and eventually made his way to Utah.  Once he reached the Bonneville Salt Flats, no one at first wanted to let him race.  The man was in his seventies with heart problems, and his Indian motorcycle wasn't in the best looking condition when compared to the other machines competing for world speed records.  Because of Burt's perseverance and positive attitude about life, he eventually won over the people at the Salt Flats and the rest is history.This movie, directed by Roger Donaldson, deals with Burt's odyssey in getting to Utah and the problems that he had to overcome.  It was no piece of cake, yet he never gave up on moving forward with his dreams.  There always seemed to be people who would come to his aid like synchronicity and help him to get over each hurdle that faced him.  The World's Fastest Indian is a beautiful testimony to never giving up on your dreams no matter how old you are.  This film is also the dream of Roger Donaldson.  His first student film was a documentary on Burt Munro.  He met Mr. Munro and realized that this old man was the stuff of movie legends.  Mr. Donaldson then spent twenty-five years trying to get The World's Fastest Indian made.  No one wanted to touch it until Anthony Hopkins read the script and decided that this was a movie he wanted to make with Roger Donaldson.  Mr. Hopkins brings to life the character of Burt Munro by depicting his eccentricities and his good-natured attitude about life and how to live it.  The audience is immediately drawn into the dreams that Mr. Munro wants to accomplish and roots whole-heartedly for him during the entire length of the film.  This is certainly a feel-good movie of the highest caliber.  It inspires one to never give up and that anything is possible if your heart is in the right place.  The DVD extras include a behind the scenes making of the film, the original documentary that was done by Roger Donaldson, a look at Southland, New Zealand and how Munro affected the people of his community, several deleted scenes, and a feature-length commentary by the movie's director/writer, Roger Donaldson.  The World's Fastest Indian is definitely one of Anthony Hopkins' best roles to date, and the movie will have you yearning to hop on a motorcycle to see just how fast you can get it to go.",5,"Without your dreams, you're nothing more than a vegetable!!!",1172275200,"02 24, 2007",2007,3741,"['Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'appeared', 'hundred', 'films', 'fifty-year', 'career', 'actor', 'famous', 'performances', 'Hannibal', 'Lector', 'legendary', 'Zorro', 'few', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'fun', 'play', 'real-life', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'seventy-year-old', 'New', 'Zealander', 'who', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'make', 'dreams', 'come', 'true', 'coming', 'America', 'racing', 'motorcycle', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats.The', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'refers', '1920', 'Indian', 'motorcycle', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'purchased', 'when', 'was', 'mid-twenties', 'time', 'bike', 'could', 'only', 'go', 'fifty', 'miles', 'hour', 'Not', 'knowing', 'hill', 'beans', 'how', 'work', 'motorcycle', 'Burt', 'took', 'slowly', 'learn', 'how', 'take', 'bike', 'apart', 'then', 'put', 'back', 'together', 'sometimes', 'having', 'make', 'motorcycle', 'parts', 'scratch', 'tool', 'shed', 'Burt', 'intent', 'was', 'make', 'bike', 'go', 'faster', 'faster', 'next', 'forty-something', 'years', 'got', 'Indian', 'do', 'speeds', 'hundred', 'miles', 'hour', 'however', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'Burt', 'dream', 'was', 'visit', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'Utah', 'Speed', 'Week', 'try', 'get', 'bike', 'go', 'over', 'two', 'hundred', 'miles', 'hour', 'one', 'really', 'thought', 'could', 'do', 'Defying', 'logic', 'Burt', 'mortgaged', 'home', 'packed', 'motorcycle', 'up', 'hopped', 'steamer', 'United', 'States', '1967', 'When', 'got', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'purchased', 'cheap', 'car', 'hooked', 'Indian', 'back', 'eventually', 'made', 'way', 'Utah', 'Once', 'reached', 'Bonneville', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'one', 'first', 'wanted', 'let', 'race', 'man', 'was', 'seventies', 'heart', 'problems', 'Indian', 'motorcycle', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'looking', 'condition', 'when', 'compared', 'other', 'machines', 'competing', 'world', 'speed', 'records', 'Burt', 'perseverance', 'positive', 'attitude', 'life', 'eventually', 'won', 'people', 'Salt', 'Flats', 'rest', 'history.This', 'movie', 'directed', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'deals', 'Burt', 'odyssey', 'getting', 'Utah', 'problems', 'had', 'overcome', 'was', 'piece', 'cake', 'yet', 'never', 'gave', 'up', 'moving', 'forward', 'dreams', 'always', 'seemed', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'come', 'aid', 'synchronicity', 'help', 'get', 'hurdle', 'faced', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'beautiful', 'testimony', 'never', 'giving', 'up', 'dreams', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'are', 'film', 'also', 'dream', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'first', 'student', 'film', 'was', 'documentary', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'met', 'Mr.', 'Munro', 'realized', 'old', 'man', 'was', 'stuff', 'movie', 'legends', 'Mr.', 'Donaldson', 'then', 'spent', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'trying', 'get', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'made', 'one', 'wanted', 'touch', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'read', 'script', 'decided', 'was', 'movie', 'wanted', 'make', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'Mr.', 'Hopkins', 'life', 'character', 'Burt', 'Munro', 'depicting', 'eccentricities', 'good-natured', 'attitude', 'life', 'how', 'live', 'audience', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'dreams', 'Mr.', 'Munro', 'accomplish', 'roots', 'whole-heartedly', 'entire', 'length', 'film', 'certainly', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'highest', 'caliber', 'one', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'anything', 'possible', 'heart', 'right', 'place', 'DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'scenes', 'making', 'film', 'original', 'documentary', 'was', 'done', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'look', 'Southland', 'New', 'Zealand', 'how', 'Munro', 'affected', 'people', 'community', 'several', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'feature-length', 'commentary', 'movie', 'director/writer', 'Roger', 'Donaldson', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'definitely', 'one', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'best', 'roles', 'date', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'yearning', 'hop', 'motorcycle', 'see', 'just', 'how', 'fast', 'can', 'get', 'go']",N/A

It's about a Kiwi guy name Burt Munro who later set a world record at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Of course, Munro is much older than other racers. And part of this movie is about the people he met on the way to Bonneville. Quite an assortment of unique characters indeed! Then he has to deal with negative people at the Flats who thought he was too old and his bike a piece of junk. But he also had some advocates who helped him along. You find yourself cheering for him to show that he may be old but the heart and spirit of a adventurous youth.It was cool to watch since that night we went to Windover (a town in Nevada near the Utah border) and went across the salt flats.

985259,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B000F8DBDK,W. freeman,"[1, 4]","I had never heard of this movie before, then i saw it on the playstation network and thought i would check it out since i'm a pretty big fan of Anthony Hopkins. First off when i saw the cover art i thought it was a movie from the early 80's and he just had his hair colored white to make him look older, then i realized it was made in 2005! Big suprise. Well as Burt Munro, someone i know (knew) nothing about, Hopkins plays his character who's dream is the come to the states to try and break the land speed record on his Indian(Motorcycle). I'm guessing he does the character justice with a great performance but there are just some things that are a bit off for me, or not practical. Obviously he was a very ""nice"" man to say the least. Spoilers.Everywhere he goes when he reaches the U.S he runs into someone unique and different and with his New Zealand charm he wins them over no matter WHAT the circumstances. First all the guys on the crew ship on the way over, then the guys in customs, almost a taxi driver, makes best friends with a cross dresser, an Indian(pun here), a soldier from Nam, a widowed lady whom he knows for a few hours and has sex with etc. Oh and i can't forget the used car salesman who gives him a car for 250 dollars and lets him use his welding equipment in his shop. Wow i wish people were really that nice. By the end of the movie your like my god did this guy just charm the pants off of everyone and everything. Real life just doesnt work that way and the movie seems to just go one about how great his whole trip is. The only negative thing about the movie that happens is he is diagnosed with Angina and a thinning of the arteries in his heart. Every so often you will see him pop a nitro gliserin tablet to stop his pains he has.By the end of the movie with is about 40 minutes to long he doesnt even know if he will get to run his motorcycle on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, which is the purpose of the whole journey. Well of course you know he will talk his way into it, which he does. So this is a bit predictable as a lot of underdog movies like this are, never give up, never give in, like your life, live the dream. Its very hard for Hopkins to really do ""wrong"" in most any film, and he does a lot right here, but its just to goody goody and not enough realism going on to make it a ""great"" film. All that said it is watchable, slow paced but interesting. Also won't give anything away but after this interview do i really need to? Does he die at the end, guess for yourself. The little boy at the beginning seemed like a very stellar little actor and i would have liked to see them team up in the film and journey on together, now THAT would have been great. While charming a cop after going through Nevada at 150mph or so, since they had no speed limit, you begin to feel like your in one of those family films where everything goes right! So i think had they brought the boy along, things could have been more interesting. Also get more detailed on Hopkins illness, which never takes its toll. At the end of the film, even though Burt is told he doesnt have long to live, it claims he went back to Bonneville 9 times to break more and more records. I find that a little contradictive myself. So while not a bad film its certainly not what i expected, or maybe it was since i had never heard of it. Also him sticking a nitro tablet in the tank of his motorcycle was never explained, perhaps the originator, who knows??So i slighty recommend this for a good family movie, nothing more nothing less. Just don't get to excited. I didn't after almost 2 hours.Btw-The racing scenes were quite good, and tense.

985261,ALSKUJF2WZ44L,B000F8DBDK,Windwolfess,"[1, 1]","A wonderful movie about the power of a dream to make a life worth living.  In this superbly-acted movie faithful to the true story of Burt Munro, Anthony Hopkins gives what he called his favorite performance, and took less money to just be part of it.  It is a captivating story of Burt Munro, a New Zealander whose meager resources were offset by a 45-year dream of testing himself and his his modified 1920 Indian motorcycle at the Bonneville Salt Flats in the 1960's.  Now in his 60's, realizing that he may not have too many years left due to health problems, he scrapes together enough money to get to Bonneville on his aged bike, modified by all manner of throw-away scrap odd parts, to begin the journey.  His neighbors find Burt's odd ways and love of motorcycles tiresome and wish that he would act his age.  Only a neighbor boy believes in him.  Along the way to Bonneville, he encounters other people who live outside the norm, and he finds acceptance and help from them, just as he accepts them and treats them as real human beings.  Burt's life might seem bare and unadorned, and he has little money, but the story reveals the true richness of his life which comes through his dream that transcends his age, his lack of money and any pretense of formal support for his endeavor.  Starting from his own belief and that of the neighbor boy, Burt encounters others who learn of his dream and find themselves believing in him, from the ships's crew across the Pacific, the transgendered hotel clerk, the used car dealer, the Native American man, and the people at the Flats during Speed Week.  As one driver remarks, ""He's the genuine thing"".  We all have dreams, and when we share in the lives of others who have a powerful dream, we begin to have hope that our own dreams might be possible.  That is the power of this movie, and it is conveyed through splendid acting, excellent camerawork and arresting scenery.

985262,A1Q15TP2FXYYMF,B000F8DBDK,"www.steveo2006.co.uk ""Steveo""","[7, 8]","There are many reasons why this film is great. Firstly, the ""true"" story of Kiwi Burt Monro - one of life's innocents, dropping all and heading off to the Salt Lake flats, is really an inspiring and moving one. I suspect that the incidents that happened on his journey have been dreamt up for the film, but we can forgive them for it. As a racer myself, I recognised the atmosphere there is at an event, with all the signing on, scruitineering, the adrenalin, the people etc.Secondly, the script is very good. Burt Monro has some wonderful one liners, and the many characters that greet him on his long journey are interesting and show us more about Monro's character each time. This is the kind of film where you know the ending, but it's the journey and the small details that make it a delight.Thirdly, the locations are awesome. I love road movies that travel the beautiful locations of America, and here you get the fantastic vistas, but of course with Burt pounding through them on his motorbike. The direction and the music, the thematic material and the shot in the arm the film gives you is really something - and there's one final element to congratulate for it...Anthony Hopkins. Since his big Hollywood break Hopkins was on a roll. Then he started drifting towards the typical Hollywood roles that didn't suit his talents. And in recent years his creditability was at it's lowest ever, thanks to rubbish like Instinct, MI:II and Bad Company. I assumed he'd given up 'acting' for the easy paycheck. However, in this film he delivers what is probably one of his best ever performances, easily his best since 1994. He totally inhabbits the character, and he does what he does best - SHOW us the character in the small moments, and not repeat mannerisms. According to Kiwis his accent is particularly good, which was always a challenge for Hopkins. Had this film had more fanfare upon release he would have easily gotten an Oscar nomination, without a doubt. If his career goes back to below par as it was before this, we can be glad at least that he gave us the character of Burt Monro.The World's Fastest Indian will not appeal to the ultra-cynical of person, but it should be an entertaining and uplifting experience to those who are able to give it attention. The film's message is simple: Life doesn't have to be as bad as people make out. Honesty's good. Being genuine is good. To me, this film is both of those things.",5,A Great Family Friendly Movie,1149984000,"06 11, 2006",2006,2433,"['are', 'many', 'reasons', 'why', 'film', 'great', 'Firstly', 'true', 'story', 'Kiwi', 'Burt', 'Monro', 'one', 'life', 'innocents', 'dropping', 'heading', 'off', 'Salt', 'Lake', 'flats', 'really', 'inspiring', 'moving', 'one', 'suspect', 'incidents', 'happened', 'journey', 'have', 'been', 'dreamt', 'up', 'film', 'can', 'forgive', 'racer', 'recognised', 'atmosphere', 'event', 'signing', 'scruitineering', 'adrenalin', 'people', 'etc.Secondly', 'script', 'very', 'good', 'Burt', 'Monro', 'wonderful', 'one', 'liners', 'many', 'characters', 'greet', 'long', 'journey', 'are', 'interesting', 'show', 'more', 'Monro', 'character', 'time', 'kind', 'film', 'where', 'know', 'ending', 'journey', 'small', 'details', 'make', 'delight.Thirdly', 'locations', 'are', 'awesome', 'love', 'road', 'movies', 'travel', 'beautiful', 'locations', 'America', 'here', 'get', 'fantastic', 'vistas', 'course', 'Burt', 'pounding', 'motorbike', 'direction', 'music', 'thematic', 'material', 'shot', 'arm', 'film', 'really', 'something', 'one', 'final', 'element', 'congratulate', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'break', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'roll', 'Then', 'started', 'drifting', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'roles', 'did', ""n't"", 'suit', 'talents', 'recent', 'years', 'creditability', 'was', 'lowest', 'ever', 'thanks', 'rubbish', 'Instinct', 'MI', 'II', 'Bad', 'Company', 'assumed', ""'d"", 'given', 'up', ""'acting"", 'easy', 'paycheck', 'However', 'film', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'performances', 'easily', 'best', '1994', 'totally', 'character', 'what', 'best', 'SHOW', 'character', 'small', 'moments', 'not', 'repeat', 'mannerisms', 'According', 'Kiwis', 'accent', 'particularly', 'good', 'was', 'always', 'challenge', 'Hopkins', 'Had', 'film', 'had', 'more', 'fanfare', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'easily', 'gotten', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'doubt', 'career', 'back', 'below', 'par', 'was', 'can', 'be', 'glad', 'least', 'gave', 'character', 'Burt', 'Monro.The', 'World', 'Fastest', 'Indian', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'ultra-cynical', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'entertaining', 'uplifting', 'experience', 'who', 'are', 'able', 'give', 'attention', 'film', 'message', 'simple', 'Life', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'as', 'bad', 'people', 'make', 'out', 'Honesty', 'good', 'Being', 'genuine', 'good', 'film', 'things']",N/A
