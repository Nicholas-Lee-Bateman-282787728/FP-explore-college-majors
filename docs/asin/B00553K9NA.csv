It reminisces of an era when cop-show scripts actually had to be well thought of and developed.  The viewer was left in a state of ever increasing suspense, with a climax at the very end of the episode.  How different were those days from today, where either sex, brutal-exotic-disproportionate violence and obscene language are to make up for the lack of smarts when writing a script (see the latest green hornet movie).  Just a note to the producers:  not a good idea to price half a season this high when effects of a recession still linger.  How about a full season box for season 2?  ...trust me on this, with this quality of show, you'll make it up in volume.

I loved the opening credits as it was the first filmed series I saw where the sponser (Ford) got a credit opening the show. In syndication that opening credit is butchered and for the arm and leg one pays for half a season  you get THE BUTCHERED SYNDICATED OPENING. I doubt Ford would mind being advertised and I doubt anyone asked them. I also doubt that anyone who put this package together even saw the original show. Also missing is the weekly introduction of a Top Ten fugitive and if I remember correctly J. Edger Hoover even appeared once in that weekly segment. Has anybody timed these episodes to see if they are chopped? How about a mimeographed (remember those) insert of an episode synopsis and listing of the guest stars. Shocking that Warner Brothers making a 100% return on videos no one will watch on the American Family Channel could'nt do a better job with the presentation. The video quality is good but to say this was ""superbly mastered"" can only mean that the reviewer stating this is wearing the same eyeglasseshe wore in 1965 when this series hit the airwaves. For $29.95 for an entire season I would say this was well bought but as they say in the Warner Brothers cartoons....""SO LONG SUCKER!!!!..That's All Folks!!""",4,NOT THE ORIGINAL PRINT,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",2011,1370,"['were', 'always', 'doing', 'something', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'kid', ""could'nt"", 'wait', 'make', 'home', 'FBI', 'sunday', 'nights', 'loved', 'opening', 'credits', 'was', 'first', 'filmed', 'series', 'saw', 'where', 'sponser', 'Ford', 'got', 'credit', 'opening', 'show', 'syndication', 'opening', 'credit', 'butchered', 'arm', 'leg', 'one', 'pays', 'season', 'get', 'BUTCHERED', 'SYNDICATED', 'OPENING', 'doubt', 'Ford', 'would', 'mind', 'being', 'advertised', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'asked', 'also', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'who', 'put', 'package', 'together', 'even', 'saw', 'original', 'show', 'Also', 'missing', 'weekly', 'introduction', 'Top', 'Ten', 'fugitive', 'remember', 'correctly', 'J.', 'Edger', 'Hoover', 'even', 'appeared', 'once', 'weekly', 'segment', 'Has', 'anybody', 'timed', 'episodes', 'see', 'are', 'chopped', 'How', 'mimeographed', 'remember', 'insert', 'episode', 'synopsis', 'listing', 'guest', 'stars', 'Shocking', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'making', '100', '%', 'return', 'one', 'will', 'watch', 'American', 'Family', 'Channel', ""could'nt"", 'do', 'better', 'job', 'presentation', 'video', 'quality', 'good', 'say', 'was', 'superbly', 'mastered', 'can', 'only', 'mean', 'reviewer', 'stating', 'wearing', 'same', 'eyeglasseshe', 'wore', '1965', 'when', 'series', 'hit', 'airwaves', '29.95', 'entire', 'season', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'well', 'bought', 'say', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'cartoons', 'SO', 'LONG', 'SUCKER', '..That', 'Folks']","The FBI: Season 1, Part 1"

I had been looking high and low for anything online for my years and now it it here. I wish they would finish the Knots Landing series also but all good things as you can see take time.

Things and LIFE in general were alot better back then .When I watch this it reminds me that life has just gotten way too serious. It allows me not to escape but to feel the exact emotions I did when I was younger. I feel the series although long awaited but well worth waiting for. I hope they finish Knots Landing also.

This show comes from the day when a one hour drama lasted almost one hour. Today's so called Prime Time Drama averages 40 minutes of actual story time. The rest of the time, 1/3 OF AN HOUR, IS FOR COMMERCIALS.  This series,The FBI, like most others in the early 60s also had many more episodes per season.  This show, the FBI Season 1, has 31 episodes averaging over 51 minutes per episode.  By comparison, the new Hawaii Five-0 series Season 1, contains 24 episodes averaging just over 42 minutes per episode.  That means you get 6 more episodes per season and ten more minutes of actual story per episode.The drama and the acting were also a hell of a lot better back then.
