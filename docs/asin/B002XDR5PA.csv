The same this time",5,I remember Mary Mary from many years ago.,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",2013,135,"['saw', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'theatre', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'primary', 'school', 'movie', 'was', 'funny', 'engaging', 'well', 'written', 'same', 'time']",N/A
1297564,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,B002XDR5PA,Classic film buff,"[2, 3]","Jean Kerr was an extremely bright, witty humorist best known for her book of lighthearted essays ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies!"" and ""Mary, Mary"" one of the longest running romantic comedies on Broadway in the 1960's.  Her sparkling, sometimes slightly astringent dialogue plus the deft performances by Barbara Bel Geddes, Barry Nelson and Michael Rennie were the reasons for this success.The story is slight; Bob McKellaway (Barry Nelson), a recently divorced book publisher is being audited by the IRS.  He enlists his lawyer Oscar Nelson (Hiram Sherman) to help straighten out the mess.  Bob is especially anxious for a swift resolution since he is set to remarry in two weeks, a young socialite Tiffany Richards (Diane McBain).  Oscar in turn has asked Bob's ex wife Mary (Debbie Reynolds) to come up to New York City from Philadelphia one Saturday to see if she can help provide answers to some of the tax questions.  Although it was a civilized, amiable divorce, Mary and Bob still have unresolved issues from their marriage.  To further complicate matters Dirk Winston, (Michael Rennie) an aging, suave movie star acquaintance of Bob's shows up with a book he wants Bob to publish and an eye for Mary.Regrettably, this fragile souffl&eacute; falls somewhat in it's transfer to the screen and is very disappointing.  Beginning with the casting, or rather miscasting of the major roles.  Barbara Bel Geddes while excellent on stage as Mary was in reality too old for the harsh motion picture cameras, and also wasn't box office.  Debbie Reynolds, while a big star was not enough of an accomplished high comedy actress to pull this off, despite a valiant effort.  Better choices would have been Joanne Woodward, Lee Remick, Dolores Hart or ideally Maggie Smith, who had made the role of Mary a personal triumph in the original London production, but who was as yet unknown in films.  Barry Nelson as Bob although from the original Broadway cast, is too broad in his playing, what probably worked on the stage comes off as hammy and over the top on screen.  Jack Lemmon, James Garner, Rod Taylor or Don Murray would all have been more suitable in the role.  Michael Rennie, also from the original Broadway cast is the only one in the cast who comes off with some slight distinction, yet more interesting choices would have been Glenn Ford, Cliff Robertson,Stephen Boyd or Christopher Plummer.  Both Hiram Sherman, who was a Broadway replacement as Oscar and Diane McBain's Tiffany loudly enunciate each word, Ms. McBain is robotic and Sherman is irritatingly smug in his delivery as if he's expecting to hear the audience chuckles in response.The director Mervyn LeRoy doesn't do well with Kerr's comedy either, he's too heavy handed and obvious, and a good deal of the time has all of the actors speaking their lines as if projecting to the balcony of the theatre, unnecessary in a film.  I would have liked to see what George Cukor, Stanley Donen, or Vincente Minnelli would have done with the property in making it less static, not just a filmed play.  Any stage play needs to be opened up beyond the confines of the proscenium when transferred to the screen.  Yet, except for several small scenes all the action takes place in the living room of Bob's apartment just as it did onstage.  If the living room was attractive to the eye, perhaps that wouldn't matter so much, but it's cluttered, cramped and dark, not the best setting for sophisticated comedy.Although the screenwriting credit goes to Richard Breen, the good news is that at least 90% of Ms. Kerr's dialogue has been retained, the bad news being most of the time it's not being delivered with any wit and subtlety.To conclude, I would recommend ""Mary, Mary"" if you're a Debbie Reynolds fan or are interested in cinema adaptations of Broadway hits.  I saw this for the first time on Turner Classic Movies two nights ago which was also it's premiere screening on the network.  Now that the ice is broken so to speak, I'm sure it will show up again, and given the slim quality of this film I would hesitate to pay $26.99 to own the DVD.",3,"""You really ought to learn when to shut up!""",1301788800,"04 3, 2011",2011,4102,"['Jean', 'Kerr', 'was', 'extremely', 'bright', 'witty', 'humorist', 'best', 'known', 'book', 'lighthearted', 'essays', 'Please', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Eat', 'Daisies', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'one', 'longest', 'running', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'Broadway', '1960', 'sparkling', 'sometimes', 'slightly', 'astringent', 'dialogue', 'deft', 'performances', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'were', 'reasons', 'success.The', 'story', 'slight', 'Bob', 'McKellaway', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'recently', 'divorced', 'book', 'publisher', 'being', 'audited', 'IRS', 'lawyer', 'Oscar', 'Nelson', 'Hiram', 'Sherman', 'help', 'straighten', 'out', 'mess', 'Bob', 'especially', 'anxious', 'swift', 'resolution', 'set', 'remarry', 'two', 'weeks', 'young', 'socialite', 'Tiffany', 'Richards', 'Diane', 'McBain', 'Oscar', 'turn', 'asked', 'Bob', 'ex', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'come', 'up', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Philadelphia', 'one', 'Saturday', 'see', 'can', 'help', 'provide', 'answers', 'tax', 'questions', 'was', 'civilized', 'amiable', 'divorce', 'Mary', 'Bob', 'still', 'have', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'marriage', 'further', 'complicate', 'matters', 'Dirk', 'Winston', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'aging', 'suave', 'movie', 'star', 'acquaintance', 'Bob', 'up', 'book', 'Bob', 'publish', 'eye', 'Mary.Regrettably', 'fragile', 'souffl', 'eacute', 'somewhat', 'transfer', 'screen', 'very', 'disappointing', 'Beginning', 'casting', 'rather', 'miscasting', 'major', 'roles', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'excellent', 'stage', 'Mary', 'was', 'reality', 'too', 'old', 'harsh', 'motion', 'picture', 'cameras', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'box', 'office', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'big', 'star', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'accomplished', 'high', 'comedy', 'actress', 'pull', 'off', 'valiant', 'effort', 'Better', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Lee', 'Remick', 'Dolores', 'Hart', 'ideally', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'role', 'Mary', 'personal', 'triumph', 'original', 'London', 'production', 'who', 'was', 'yet', 'unknown', 'films', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'Bob', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'too', 'broad', 'playing', 'what', 'probably', 'worked', 'stage', 'off', 'hammy', 'top', 'screen', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'James', 'Garner', 'Rod', 'Taylor', 'Don', 'Murray', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suitable', 'role', 'Michael', 'Rennie', 'also', 'original', 'Broadway', 'cast', 'only', 'one', 'cast', 'who', 'off', 'slight', 'distinction', 'yet', 'more', 'interesting', 'choices', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Glenn', 'Ford', 'Cliff', 'Robertson', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'Hiram', 'Sherman', 'who', 'was', 'Broadway', 'replacement', 'Oscar', 'Diane', 'McBain', 'Tiffany', 'loudly', 'enunciate', 'word', 'Ms.', 'McBain', 'robotic', 'Sherman', 'irritatingly', 'smug', 'delivery', 'expecting', 'hear', 'audience', 'chuckles', 'response.The', 'director', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'Kerr', 'comedy', 'either', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'obvious', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'actors', 'speaking', 'lines', 'projecting', 'balcony', 'theatre', 'unnecessary', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'what', 'George', 'Cukor', 'Stanley', 'Donen', 'Vincente', 'Minnelli', 'would', 'have', 'done', 'property', 'making', 'less', 'static', 'not', 'just', 'filmed', 'play', 'stage', 'play', 'be', 'opened', 'up', 'confines', 'proscenium', 'when', 'transferred', 'screen', 'several', 'small', 'scenes', 'action', 'place', 'living', 'room', 'Bob', 'apartment', 'just', 'did', 'onstage', 'living', 'room', 'was', 'attractive', 'eye', 'perhaps', 'would', ""n't"", 'matter', 'so', 'much', 'cluttered', 'cramped', 'dark', 'not', 'best', 'setting', 'sophisticated', 'comedy.Although', 'screenwriting', 'credit', 'Richard', 'Breen', 'good', 'news', 'least', '90', '%', 'Ms.', 'Kerr', 'dialogue', 'been', 'retained', 'bad', 'news', 'being', 'most', 'time', 'not', 'being', 'delivered', 'wit', 'subtlety.To', 'conclude', 'would', 'recommend', 'Mary', 'Mary', ""'re"", 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'fan', 'are', 'interested', 'cinema', 'adaptations', 'Broadway', 'hits', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'Turner', 'Classic', 'Movies', 'two', 'nights', 'was', 'also', 'premiere', 'screening', 'network', 'Now', 'ice', 'broken', 'so', 'speak', ""'m"", 'sure', 'will', 'show', 'up', 'again', 'given', 'slim', 'quality', 'film', 'would', 'hesitate', 'pay', '26.99', 'own', 'DVD']",N/A

Reynolds was a busy, yet under-rated actress. And as one of the last of the studio stars out the door of MGM, her career seemed to fall apart pretty badly (as did her marriage to Harry Karl, who gambled away her fortune).  Still the 60s were a career high for her. The box office of THE SINGING SUN and HOW THE WEST was won pleased her MGM bosses, but THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN must have been her shining moment. GOODBYE CHARLIE was, well, less so.MARY MARY is about a successful New York-based couple who have divorced. It has lots to recommend it. Jean Kerr's play, however, is earthbound on the screen. Way too talky in that stilted way a play that refuses to open up for film always does. Debbie delivers a really good performance, always giving her lines a natural conversational spin and she's surrounded by a topnotch cast. However, this is a prime example of a film that could have been more realistically adapted, the material less stagey. Still it's good to see this ensemble put it over.

Titles that one never expected to see on DVD, many of which have never been on home video at all, are now available from Warner Archive (go to [...] and find 100s of surprising titles, both from the silent and the sound era, mostly at $[...] each).As for ""Mary, Mary,"" it is a small but definite pleasure to see this unsuccessful film version of a very big Broadway hit (this may have been the first film that was released while the original show was still on Broadway, and it continued to run for some time after the film had disappeared from view). Of the three Broadway leads, only Barbara Bel Geddes was replaced, and having seen her brilliant performance on stage, I can say that Debbie Reynolds makes a game try at what passed for sophisticated comedy in the early 60s (its author, Jean Kerr, was a master of this genre) but ahe is overwhelmed by the staginess of the piece as they filmed it. The performances, under Mervyn LeRoy's overemphatic direction, are way too large and most of the laughs are missing (Barry Nelson can barely get through a speech without waving his arms wiidly), but the film looks great, particularly in its 16x9 widescreen glory, and as an artifact of its period, you could find a worse way to spend two hours.",3,"Hooray for Warner Archive! and at least one cheer for ""Mary, Mary""",1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,1323,"['First', 'big', 'hurrah', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'order-on-demand', 'video', 'service', 'one', 'never', 'expected', 'see', 'DVD', 'many', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'home', 'video', 'are', 'now', 'available', 'Warner', 'Archive', 'go', '[', ']', 'find', '100s', 'surprising', 'titles', 'silent', 'sound', 'era', 'mostly', '[', ']', '.As', 'Mary', 'Mary', 'small', 'definite', 'pleasure', 'see', 'unsuccessful', 'film', 'version', 'very', 'big', 'Broadway', 'hit', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'original', 'show', 'was', 'still', 'Broadway', 'continued', 'run', 'time', 'film', 'had', 'disappeared', 'view', 'three', 'Broadway', 'only', 'Barbara', 'Bel', 'Geddes', 'was', 'replaced', 'having', 'seen', 'brilliant', 'performance', 'stage', 'can', 'say', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'game', 'try', 'what', 'passed', 'sophisticated', 'comedy', 'early', '60s', 'author', 'Jean', 'Kerr', 'was', 'master', 'genre', 'overwhelmed', 'staginess', 'piece', 'filmed', 'performances', 'Mervyn', 'LeRoy', 'overemphatic', 'direction', 'are', 'way', 'too', 'large', 'most', 'laughs', 'are', 'missing', 'Barry', 'Nelson', 'can', 'barely', 'get', 'speech', 'waving', 'arms', 'wiidly', 'film', 'great', 'particularly', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'glory', 'artifact', 'period', 'could', 'find', 'worse', 'way', 'spend', 'two', 'hours']",N/A
