In my opinion Tyler is losing his finesse. He is losing his creativity. All of the playes and movies are all the same. I do understand that these situations happen all day everyday. With this play, I became very bored. this was very surprising to me since I love his work but I can do without this one. I did like where the storyline was going but something was missing. I feel like this play was thrown together. The characters were ok but some of them were extra. I am not a fan of D'atra Hicks. The characters were not well developed. He could have spent more time developing the characters allowings us to see how the characters progress. I was so happy when it was over! I did like the ole school songs at the rent party that was it. I will not purchase this one! Luckily, I was able to see this one for free. I encourage everyone to look at this play and form your own opinion.",2,Not his best work,1316217600,"09 17, 2011",2011,1028,"['Let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'fan', 'have', 'been', 'supporting', 'day', 'one', 'buying', 'movies', 'plays', 'going', 'live', 'shows', 'opinion', 'Tyler', 'losing', 'finesse', 'losing', 'creativity', 'playes', 'movies', 'are', 'same', 'do', 'understand', 'situations', 'happen', 'day', 'everyday', 'play', 'became', 'very', 'bored', 'was', 'very', 'surprising', 'love', 'work', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'did', 'like', 'where', 'storyline', 'was', 'going', 'something', 'was', 'missing', 'feel', 'play', 'was', 'thrown', 'together', 'characters', 'were', 'ok', 'were', 'extra', 'am', 'not', 'fan', ""D'atra"", 'Hicks', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'developing', 'characters', 'allowings', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'progress', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'was', 'did', 'ole', 'school', 'songs', 'rent', 'party', 'was', 'will', 'not', 'purchase', 'one', 'Luckily', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'one', 'free', 'encourage', 'everyone', 'look', 'play', 'form', 'own', 'opinion']",Laugh To Keep From Crying
