1026563,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B000JJ4DF0,,"[6, 6]","""The Bollywood Dance Workout"" with Hemalayaa supposedly provides 50 minutes of dance workout for the enthusiastic student. The DVD does try to be a workout.  Complete with a warm-up, dance segment, floorwork and cool down, Hemalayaa and her two ""sister"" class shimmy their way through an upbeat albeit redundantly soundtracked ersatz Bhangra routine.  Unfortunately, some of the moves are difficult to follow and Hemalayaa offers no ""basic"" section on the DVD where the student can actually watch and practice the moves before attempting to follow the choreography. The Bollywood Dance Workout is a wonderful idea with plenty of potential but little execution.  It is, sadly, disappointing.I consider myself to be an expert of sorts due to my thirty years of effective injury-free exercise (running, kickboxing, aerobics, yoga, Pilates). However, I am not a dancer. With that said, some of the moves that Hemalayaa suggests performing while ""letting go and having fun""--head and neck throws and back undulations, can potentially cause injury if attempted without control and form and with complete abandon.  Again, a segment where Hemalayaa teaches the move outside of a dance sequence in slow motion with the proper attention to form and control would definitely be beneficial and lower the risk of pulling one's neck or hurting one's back.I purchased the DVD because I find the dancing performed in Bollywood flicks combines sexiness, innocent fun and high energy. Unfortunately Hemalayaa's routine does and does not fit the bill adequately. Hemalayaa embodies high energy, but her voice over instruction does not adequately teach the moves.  The music used during the workout is repetitive; the moves are attractive, but never explained in terms of India and its culture and worst of all although the cardio dance is high impact, incorporating hopping and jumping, I never really broke a sweat.  Therefore I must categorize the Bollywood Dance Workout as just an introduction to the type of dancing seen in Bollywood film despite the inclusion of a warm-up (watch out for those ridiculous neck and head throws) and overly long, in relation to the duration of the cardio, cool-down.Hemalayaa's instructions encourage, but for the most part she urges the student ""to just let go and have fun"" rather than concentrate on timing and step-by-step implementation of each move.  As this routine is really not a workout, my advise is the same as Hemalayaa's ""just let go, let the music move you and have fun.""If you don't you are not going to work your heart enough and the purpose of the 50 minutes is lost.Hemalayaa's bonus dance segment features the trio and then Hemalayaa in a solo performance. Difficult to follow because of fade-out camera techniques and odd angle shots, it can visually please, but is useless for studying technique unless one watches it repeatedly. Unfortunately, I don't have time for that.Bottom line:  The Bollywood Dance Workout with Hemalayaa disappoints.  Its fun to watch and try, but in terms of a workout where one's heart rate is elevated, this one did not do it for me, but again, I am not an exercise beginner. The overall presentation would benefit from a fundamental moves segment where each of the body movements are explained in terms of the actual doing and their relevance in or derivation from Indian culture.

It's kind of a goofy workout, maybe good for days when you don't want to take yourself too seriously. My problem with it is that it's just too high-impact for my taste. I guess I was expecting it to be low-impact from the description and from seeing a preview on Youtube. But in actuality there's a lot of hopping and jumping that's more on the high-impact side. Honestly, the moves are a bit too masculine for my taste. I go more for feminine moves. But if you like high-impact and don't mind the silliness, this could be a good choice for you. It will give you a thorough workout, from your thighs to your shoulders.If you're looking for a piece Hindi choreography, forget it.

It has its warm up and a number of segments -- some basic moves (for the workout) and then a couple routines, ending with some yoga-infused cooldowns, and a few minutes of floor work in between. The workouts are more challenging, and if you're not in the best of shape you may want to pace yourself: some of the moves involve a lot of knee bends and squatting deep down and there's hopping around (high impact, definitely), so if you don't have strong knees or have a lot of weight to carry, modify until you're stronger -- you'll still get a good workout -- especially with the dance steps and kicking your knees up high -- and Hemalayaa makes you use your arms a lot, which is good for total body. It's a lot of fun to dance around, the music is nice (you don't have to have voiceover while working out, either), the setting is beautiful, and Hemalayaa is cool, along with her 2 dancers (by the way, she emphasizes a lot of ""sass"" as part of the workout -- which some might find annoying). If you love bellydance or think the Bollywood numbers are a blast you should really enjoy this. Some of the moves are definitely different from what you see in other videos and DVDs (the names of some of the moves, such as ""Feed the Chickens"" are fun, too), in a good way. One word, besides the potential hard work on the knees, if you aren't familiar with a lot of these types of dance moves, a bellydance dvd or class might help a lot, since a lot of these steps are bellydance inspired, only with more oomph.

Schneider,"[1, 2]","I enjoy trying different workouts and will often check them out from my local library to try them and to see if the workout is something that would hold up over time and keep my interest. With this dvd I found it moderately fun to do but not one that I would choose to purchase.The workout is approx 46 minutes in length, with a 6 minute warm-up and 9 minute cool-down segment.  I would consider the workout an intermediate workout and the choreography was fairly straight-forward.  You run the gamut from shimmies, spine rolls, hip scoops, hops, deep plies (bends), hip circles, torso circles and rib isolations.  There is also a little ab work in their too.  You are definitely moving, but it is not a sweaty aerobic workout.Here are my likes and dislikes on this one:  the cuing was so-so, sometimes the cuing was done as she did the move instead of a little before so you knew what was coming, the camera angles did not always show the footwork at the beginning of a move, which I could still follow but I found rather odd for a workout video where this seems important.  The warm-up also included face exercises(?)....what(?) am I in danger of spraining my lips or something if they aren't warmed up?  Not sure what that was about.  The neck rolls I thought were in bad form because you are dipping your head all the way back which I had been instructed by my old dance teachers you do not want to do because it grinds your neck discs together.  This I try to avoid.  What I did like: the set was colorful, as were the costumes, the dancers seemed happy and like they were having fun, the moves were moderately fun to do and the music was not overpowering. It is something different if you want something out of your ordinary fitness routine and it does get you moving.Overall, it was fine for an occasional work-out, but I can't see myself putting this one into rotation and would not choose to purchase it.

1026575,A2W8EF4E3ZP3DC,B000JJ4DF0,Delos,"[1, 2]","First - this is not for people with knee problems. There will be too much (literal) hopping around, and too often knees will be twisted or stressed sideways.I thought this would be a slam dunk lovefest for me, as I prefer any workouts I can do barefoot. I loved the music from the start. The rest was a mix of pros and cons for me, though. Here's the basic format:Warming - 6 minutesPlaytime Begins - 7 minutesFootwork - 6 minutesNow we're hot! - 8 minutesGround Play - 6 minutesPlayful Dance - 5 minutesCool it now! - 9 minutesBonus performances - 6 minutesOverall - the great and catchy music is somewhat dampened by her slightly too loud, dubbed in after the fact narration. Prepare to be annoyed by her announcing the move change *after* it happens, many times. Luckily, it comes with the option to turn off that narration track and watch it with music only; definitely something I'd do on the 3rd or 4th go around.This is not at all a low quality looking production. Unfortunately, it did suffer from some bad editing, meaning if you are following the music and the narration, there will be visual cuts often that will result in the girls on screen being suddenly off rhythm, or to have switched sides, that will cause a couple seconds of confusion.Warming - unless you know a bit about classical indian dance, prepare to be confused why you're doing so many seemingly odd face or neck-specific stretching. Those really won't come into play later in the video, though, other than being reminded to smile.Playtime - you are about to spend most of this time dizzy. You'll be whipping your head about a bunch in combination with a lot of spinning moves. I don't know if the disorientation was worse for me, because I was trying to watch what to do at the same time my head naturally would have been following my body moving away from the direction of the TV, though. Perhaps more tolerable if you've memorized the routine a bit after a few rounds.Footwork - it starts easy but, as one of the other reviewers noted, you're going to feel clumsy compared to her once it goes double time. At this point, you realize why she's been mentioning so much  not to worry about rhythm and form and just keep moving.Now we're Hot - There's no way this portion of the workout can be easily adapted to low impact. Here's where your hopping around on one foot laterally will come in. You will indeed feel the burn in your entire lower body, even from the beginning of the segment.Ground play - I loved the way she approached what would otherwise be boring, basic crunches in other classes. Highly recommend. These are moves I'll be using from here on out.Cool down - definitely turn off the narration for this part, if you haven't already, for a nice, relaxing cool down. It was only at this point, with some reeeeeeally slow pans and close ups of her hips and chest, that it occured to me the cameraman might have a thing for her.",3,"Good parts, bad parts",1364169600,"03 25, 2013",2013,2917,"['First', 'not', 'people', 'knee', 'problems', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'literal', 'hopping', 'around', 'too', 'often', 'knees', 'will', 'be', 'twisted', 'stressed', 'sideways.I', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'slam', 'dunk', 'lovefest', 'prefer', 'workouts', 'can', 'do', 'barefoot', 'loved', 'music', 'start', 'rest', 'was', 'mix', 'pros', 'cons', 'though', 'Here', 'basic', 'format', 'Warming', '6', 'minutesPlaytime', 'Begins', '7', 'minutesFootwork', '6', 'minutesNow', ""'re"", 'hot', '8', 'minutesGround', 'Play', '6', 'minutesPlayful', 'Dance', '5', 'minutesCool', 'now', '9', 'minutesBonus', 'performances', '6', 'minutesOverall', 'great', 'catchy', 'music', 'somewhat', 'dampened', 'slightly', 'too', 'loud', 'dubbed', 'fact', 'narration', 'Prepare', 'be', 'annoyed', 'announcing', 'move', 'change', '*after*', 'many', 'times', 'Luckily', 'option', 'turn', 'off', 'narration', 'track', 'watch', 'music', 'only', 'definitely', 'something', ""'d"", 'do', '3rd', '4th', 'go', 'around.This', 'not', 'low', 'quality', 'looking', 'production', 'Unfortunately', 'did', 'suffer', 'bad', 'editing', 'meaning', 'are', 'following', 'music', 'narration', 'will', 'be', 'visual', 'cuts', 'often', 'will', 'result', 'girls', 'screen', 'being', 'suddenly', 'rhythm', 'have', 'switched', 'sides', 'will', 'cause', 'couple', 'seconds', 'confusion.Warming', 'know', 'bit', 'classical', 'indian', 'dance', 'prepare', 'be', 'confused', 'why', ""'re"", 'doing', 'so', 'many', 'seemingly', 'odd', 'face', 'neck-specific', 'stretching', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'play', 'later', 'video', 'though', 'other', 'being', 'reminded', 'smile.Playtime', 'are', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'dizzy', ""'ll"", 'be', 'whipping', 'head', 'bunch', 'combination', 'lot', 'spinning', 'moves', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'disorientation', 'was', 'worse', 'was', 'trying', 'watch', 'what', 'do', 'same', 'time', 'head', 'naturally', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'body', 'moving', 'away', 'direction', 'TV', 'though', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'tolerable', ""'ve"", 'memorized', 'routine', 'bit', 'few', 'rounds.Footwork', 'easy', 'one', 'other', 'reviewers', 'noted', ""'re"", 'going', 'feel', 'clumsy', 'compared', 'once', 'double', 'time', 'point', 'realize', 'why', 'been', 'mentioning', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'worry', 'rhythm', 'form', 'just', 'keep', 'moving.Now', ""'re"", 'Hot', 'way', 'portion', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'adapted', 'low', 'impact', 'Here', 'where', 'hopping', 'around', 'one', 'foot', 'laterally', 'will', 'come', 'will', 'indeed', 'feel', 'burn', 'entire', 'lower', 'body', 'even', 'beginning', 'segment.Ground', 'loved', 'way', 'approached', 'what', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'boring', 'basic', 'crunches', 'other', 'classes', 'Highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'moves', ""'ll"", 'be', 'using', 'here', 'out.Cool', 'down', 'definitely', 'turn', 'off', 'narration', 'part', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'nice', 'relaxing', 'cool', 'down', 'was', 'only', 'point', 'reeeeeeally', 'slow', 'pans', 'close', 'ups', 'hips', 'chest', 'occured', 'cameraman', 'might', 'have', 'thing']",The Bollywood Dance Workout with Hemalayaa
1026576,A33AQPJYH7UUXR,B000JJ4DF0,"Desert Gypsy ""A Brooklyn Girl Out West""","[2, 2]","I hate working out and on top of that I have a bit of a disability to contend with which in my own mind gives me every excuse in the book to avoid any ""organized"" form of exercise. I've decided that 2012 is the year to get my a** - ummm,.... *act* together, especially health-wise so I've made a commitment to find ways to improve my health and fitness levels. In doing so I had to find inspiring and fun ways to stick with a program that works for me. Luckily I found this DVD which IMO is the perfect solution for those like me that need a little FUN in their workout.Others have described the program at length so I won't go into detail their but I will confirm, yup she does the classic pole dancer hair toss and sexy eyes and you need to be okay with that. I'm more than okay with that - since no one is critiquing me in my living room, I do the sexy eyes right along with her! Beautiful setting and great music, btw!Edited to add: The DVD features the following sections:Warm Up - 6 minutesPlaytime Begins - basic steps 7 minutesFootwork - Fancier steps to burn calories 6 minutesNow We're Hot - Legwork/Endurance 8 minutesGround Play - tone abs, buttocks and core 6 minutesPlayful Dance - Cardio for fat burning and improved coordination 5 minutesCool It Now - return to resting heart rate 9 minutesBonus Performances - Get Inspired! 6 minutesI like that you can turn off the instruction and it just uses the music and visual instruction. I have watched the whole thing but so far only had the ability to get through the first section. It gives a great warm-up and I did not hurt myself which is usually VERY easy for me to do. Goes with the natural flow and rhythms of the body without contorting me into crazy painful positions. My feet stay on the floor most of the time so this is very low impact which is great for my knees (bad arthritis and screws holding knees caps in place due to falls).I'm very pleased with this program and considering how many I own and never use that's saying a lot!

1026577,AY1HVIM2V067E,B000JJ4DF0,"Edward G. Nilges ""Author, 'Build Your Own .Ne...","[32, 32]","I was a little concerned about adding ""The Bollywood Workout"" to my aerobics workouts. For one thing, I thought it might only be for girls. Also, Indian dancing is barefoot, and the moves are impossible in gym shoes. I like dancing without shoes, the human foot was meant for this, but injured myself when doing aerobic workouts without running shoes.I decided to give it a try because in Bollywood films, the guys dance just as crazily as the girls, trying to impress them I would suppose. As to the shoe issue, the ONLY impact movements in this workout are the two and three hop Hare Krishna moves and Hemalayaa is very conscientious about telling you to bend the knee to absorb the stress. The other foot moves are characteristic of Indian dance and art: rather than being *en pointe* or a continual *jete* into space (with stress on landing) Indian dance stays rooted to the earth and gets its strength building from variants of *plie*, if you'll pardon my French!This I found a very rewarding workout that unlike Jane Fonda's (which I also like) seems to last far less than fifty minutes, because there is more variety. The ladies look like real women and not Barbie dolls but are ""eye candy"" all the same.You do need to be careful in the head whip moves if you have any history of neck or back trouble. But doing them slowly and ramping up may (in my nonmedical opinion) help to clear these very problems up.Of course, as an introduction to the vast dance tradition of India, this is like playing Louie-Louie on the *sitar* and purists may be offended. But Bollywood itself plays around, respectfully, with India's traditions and this workout introduces the Westerner to many unvisited bodily zones, for example, when Hemalayaa invites you to breathe into a specific area.More advanced dancers will of course laugh at these gals, but those of us fighting depression and advancing age with Siva's dance applaud Hemalayaa's efforts to bring this important practice to ordinary gymnosophistical slobs such as yours truly.",5,Great workout...makes time fly,1202860800,"02 13, 2008",2008,2024,"['was', 'little', 'concerned', 'adding', 'Bollywood', 'Workout', 'aerobics', 'workouts', 'one', 'thing', 'thought', 'might', 'only', 'be', 'girls', 'Also', 'Indian', 'dancing', 'barefoot', 'moves', 'are', 'impossible', 'gym', 'shoes', 'dancing', 'shoes', 'human', 'foot', 'was', 'meant', 'injured', 'when', 'doing', 'aerobic', 'workouts', 'running', 'shoes.I', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'guys', 'dance', 'just', 'as', 'crazily', 'girls', 'trying', 'impress', 'would', 'suppose', 'shoe', 'issue', 'ONLY', 'impact', 'movements', 'workout', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'hop', 'Hare', 'Krishna', 'moves', 'Hemalayaa', 'very', 'conscientious', 'telling', 'bend', 'knee', 'absorb', 'stress', 'other', 'foot', 'moves', 'are', 'characteristic', 'Indian', 'dance', 'art', 'rather', 'being', '*en', 'pointe*', 'continual', '*jete*', 'space', 'stress', 'landing', 'Indian', 'dance', 'stays', 'rooted', 'earth', 'strength', 'building', 'variants', '*plie*', ""'ll"", 'pardon', 'French', 'found', 'very', 'rewarding', 'workout', 'Jane', 'Fonda', 'also', 'like', 'last', 'far', 'less', 'fifty', 'minutes', 'more', 'variety', 'ladies', 'look', 'real', 'women', 'not', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'are', 'eye', 'candy', 'same.You', 'do', 'need', 'be', 'careful', 'head', 'whip', 'have', 'history', 'neck', 'back', 'trouble', 'doing', 'slowly', 'ramping', 'up', 'may', 'nonmedical', 'opinion', 'help', 'clear', 'very', 'problems', 'up.Of', 'course', 'introduction', 'vast', 'dance', 'tradition', 'India', 'playing', 'Louie-Louie', '*sitar*', 'purists', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'Bollywood', 'around', 'respectfully', 'India', 'traditions', 'workout', 'Westerner', 'many', 'unvisited', 'bodily', 'zones', 'example', 'when', 'Hemalayaa', 'breathe', 'specific', 'area.More', 'advanced', 'dancers', 'will', 'course', 'laugh', 'gals', 'fighting', 'depression', 'advancing', 'age', 'Siva', 'dance', 'applaud', 'Hemalayaa', 'efforts', 'bring', 'important', 'practice', 'ordinary', 'gymnosophistical', 'slobs', 'such', 'yours', 'truly']",The Bollywood Dance Workout with Hemalayaa

In the beginning, this is a slow paced dance workout that builds to some heart pumping cardio--it got me sweating!The DVD is broken into 7-8 segements, including a warm up and cool down. Each segment concentrates on various areas of the body, using Bollywood dance moves. I enjoyed doing this DVD and the 50 mins flew by quickly. My only complaint is when I started to get really heated up with the hardcore cardio moves, the workout was over!Pros: Fun, doesn't feel like almost an hour, works body from head to toe, you WILL feel it the next day, easy to learn and follow with modifications if you can't go all the wayCons: Workout ends right as you get heated up and are getting into it, lots of hopping for those with bad knees, some moves are a little silly but the instructor tells you to ""have fun with it"" and ""dance like no one is watching""--isn't that what dance is all about anyway?Overall, this was a great workout I look forward to adding to my rotation of cardio DVDs. Surprisingly, the areas that were sore the next day were unconvential ones: tops of my thighs, back (muscles, not spine) and shoulders (you ""bounce"" your shoulders A LOT, giving them a good workout)If you love some silly dance with your cardio (plus there's a little floorwork segment on abs) then this is for you.

1026595,A9LATUEW5YOI4,B000JJ4DF0,S. Gardner,"[1, 1]","This is a video I wish I could love, but that just doesn't do it for me.  Part of it is sheer silliness - flubbing the lips in the warm-up? - and part of it is that Hemalayaa's narration style bothers me.  (It might work for other people, but I find her to be a bit too flip.)  There's the occasional odd transition, and the background dancers are sometimes doing something completely different from what Hemalayaa is demonstrating, which is confusing - is it a modification for more/less advanced viewers? is it bad cueing? what?As far as the workout goes, it's actually pretty fun.  The moves might not necessarily be Bollywood, but they've got enough of the flavor to offer something different from a lot of the dance-style videos out there.  The moves are generally easy enough for anyone to follow, although people with bad knees may find the emphasis on knee movement to be difficult or painful; it's more high-impact than not, with a fair amount of hopping in the workout proper. There's a lot of repetition, which makes picking up the moves very easy but which can make things a little boring.Overall, this video is a mixed bag for me.  The workout is enjoyable but the narration is not, and the hopping may be a bit much for a lot of people.

1026596,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B000JJ4DF0,Sneaky Burrito,"[1, 1]","I will start this off by saying that I am not a dancer, by any stretch of the imagination.  I am neither graceful nor coordinated and I was always the kid in ballet class turning the wrong way.  I have trouble following complicated choreography.  Nonetheless, sometimes I like to attempt dance-style exercise DVDs in the privacy of my own living room.  (For what it's worth, I know next to nothing about Bollywood-style or bhangra dance.)  This information is all just to give you some perspective on my review.First, some things I liked about the DVD:*The set is pretty and appropriate*I didn't find the choreography difficult to follow, even with my (lack of) background*I thought the clothing worn by the participants was suitable for an exercise DVD (reminded me a bit of bellydancing get-up but with wide-legged pants instead of yoga pants or skirts)*The women (Hemalayaa as well as her two companions) were slender, but had feminine bodies and did not look like fitness models*Segments with clearly-delineated beginnings and ends mean you can choose just a couple to do if you're pressed for timeAnd some things I didn't care for:*The music was irritating (each segment had its own music, but they were very short pieces of music played on an endless loop)*Hemalayaa talks too much (I understand there's an option to turn this off, though I haven't explored all the DVD menus in depth)*The cueing is off; Hemalayaa will be doing one thing and the two women behind her will be doing something else, or they will be a half-step behind*The verbal cues to the person at home are off; the best comparison I can make is to a sports commentator talking about things other people are doing as -- or slightly after -- they happen.  It's almost like she's surprised at what comes next.*The woman in the blue top and black pants doesn't always look particularly happy to be there; she doesn't smile very often (Hemalayaa and the woman in red pants seem happy enough)*The camera work was, at times, quite annoying; there'd be a white flash or a moment where the screen went black, and when the picture came back, the participants were on to different moves or were now half a beat off what I had been doing in time with them, previouslySome notes on the segments:Warming: I understand that this style of dance makes heavy use of the neck and head, and while I appreciate the amount of time dedicated to this, other areas were lacking.  There really wasn't enough focus on the large muscles of the legs (at least not for a suitable length of time).  The performers didn't do any sort of count, so it was difficult to tell if the same moves were done equally on both sides.  Speeds of moves changed without warning at times.  And sometimes, you just couldn't see what the participants were doing because of the camera angle.Playtime Begins: This segment has a lot of lower body work and so can partly be considered an extension of the warmup for the legs and hips.  There are some really deep pli&eacute;s here and a lot of spinning in circles.  The background dancers are definitely out of sync at times, and this segment contained some of the white flashes I mentioned earlier.  These made me think that perhaps some bits had been edited out and the rest had not been spliced back together particularly well.Footwork: This segment has some full body movements, walking, head shaking, and a bit more.  The camera angle changes seemingly at random.Now We're Hot!: I did not find this segment to be hard on my knees, but I can see how it might affect some people.  There are a lot of bouncing pli&eacute;s in this segment and a lot of hopping on one leg.  One thing that bothered me a bit was the line: ""allow it [your knee] to be the shock absorber.""  I do have bad knees, and while this segment didn't bother me, physically, I'm not too keen on knees as shock absorbers!Ground Play: THIS was the segment that hurt my knees.  There are some squats where you go down so far, your rear end is almost on the ground between your heels.  Later, you BOUNCE into this position.  The only warning is: ""try that a few times and see if it's okay on your knees.""  I really have to back off on this one for fear of injury.  There's a bit of ab work on the ground that's not too bad, though.Playful Dance: The other two women mysteriously disappeared for this segment.  This segment involves a fair amount of jumping around, including something like a ski jump and a ""running man"" move.  Unfortunately, due to the camera angle, you can't see Hemalayaa's legs for a large part of this.Cool It Now!: This segment's camera work left a lot to be desired, as well.  It's not a bad cool down; it involves gentle stretching with movements that are not held for too long.  The last bit might be hard on your knees if you have bad knees like I do.  The only thing I really don't care for is that it gets a bit boring and repetitive.Who would this be good for?  I can think of a couple of instances in which you might want to use this DVD.  One way I have used it in the past is to do a couple of segments as warm-ups before weightlifting/strength training.  This way, I can avoid segments that I know would hurt my knees, but still have a little cardio to get moving so I'm not lifting weights with cold muscles.  It's just not intense enough on its own to burn a lot of calories and to constitute a full workout for someone like me, who is fairly experienced as an exerciser.  This *might* be good for a beginning exerciser who knows her limits in terms of knee function, or who doesn't have knee trouble to begin with.  The impact is mostly low with some higher-impact moves (e.g., jumps).  You do not have to be particularly coordinated.I can live with the music, I suppose.  I think if the production value -- editing, syncing, voiceovers/cueing, coordination of moves among Hemalayaa and the backup dancers -- had been higher, I'd've rounded up to 3 stars.  This had a lot of potential that, unfortunately, it really didn't live up to.  It might work for some people (see the previous paragraph), but it had some major flaws and it really wasn't right for me.The running time for the entire workout is about 50 minutes.",2,not

1026601,AQF3D0KX5SFCM,B000JJ4DF0,"Touch Remedy ""TouchRemedy""","[45, 52]","I've tried Hemalayaa's older videos, her Yoga for Urban Living & Dosha Yoga & felt though she has good intentions, she didn't have enough body awareness to be teaching something that is focused on having that ability & cultivating it further. She was good that her videos overall would keep someone who doesn't work out regularly heart rate up. Since this is just dancing, I figured this might be her strength, but I was wrong.The menu choices include: Intro, Play, Chapters, Bonus Performances, Music Options (music only, music w/narration), & other videos from Acacia.The other videos clips are Hemalayaa's Yoga for young bodies for 1:30, Yoga Trance Dance :30, Duncan Wong: awakening level :30 (he's awesome), The Elaine Petrone Method 9:44 (has a lot of video testimonials)The Bonus Performance was same music showing Hemalayaa w/two girls in slow motion fade in/out clips of them dancing for almost 3 min, then Hemalayaa alone for 3 min w/paused video, slow mo, double video effects, etc. to make the dancing look better then it is & you can't follow along with this either.In the intro, Hemalayaa says is from Bangra, which is from Northern India dance (big, bold, sassy, & outrageous)& incorporates modern dance, hip-hop, even belly dancing.The 2 backup dancers are Juju & Kimberly (who's also the stage director & consultant). In the credits, these dancers were dead last which is very unusual.The chapters are:Warming (6 min), Playtime Begins (7 min), Footwork (6 min), Now we're hot! (8 min), Ground Play (6 min), Playful Dance (5 min), Cook it now! (9 min)The set is gorgeous, with colors & textures, the music is fun, but it's looped after a few seconds & gets annoying after a while wanting to hear the rest of the song.One of the dancers didn't know when the next move was herself many times which is annoying & shows they didn't practice enough. The voice over cuing was ok, She didn't really break anything down, or really give any body movement instruction to help you understand how to move, but since easy moves, it isn't so bad. She just tells you to ""get down, let go, get sassy, dance like no one's watching"" throughout.At the playful dance portion where she is alone, she narrates kinda a routine, but very repetitious. She has you do a goddess move where you move forward toward the tv pushing one hip out leading... then does a literal hip-hop running man (moving backwards) though she does it in a more simplified/corny style & alternate those. She said it's natural they go together & ""the running man is RUNNING AWAY.. actually he's running fwd toward the goddess..."" Which makes NO sense.There were some good ones, but very few. I got bored with the repetition. You will get your heart rate up since she incorporates a lot of hopping... like hopping 3x in a row to one side, hop & wiggle your gluts, then the other many times or other moves like a pony from the 50s in an Indian style or other moves that have knee lifts.The idea is there, but I still don't like Hemalayaa's style or think her ability to dance was good enough to be teaching. I found myself following the background dancer who knew the routine instead.If you want a hybrid Indian dance that's corny, silly & helps you let go because it's easy & silly, this is for you.You can see a preview at the distributer Acacia com",3,"Corny, silly, repetitious, cute, dancing style for sleepovers",1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,3315,"[""'ve"", 'tried', 'Hemalayaa', 'older', 'videos', 'Yoga', 'Urban', 'Living', 'Dosha', 'Yoga', 'felt', 'good', 'intentions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'body', 'awareness', 'be', 'teaching', 'something', 'focused', 'having', 'ability', 'cultivating', 'further', 'was', 'good', 'videos', 'overall', 'would', 'keep', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'regularly', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'just', 'dancing', 'figured', 'might', 'be', 'strength', 'was', 'wrong.The', 'menu', 'choices', 'include', 'Intro', 'Play', 'Chapters', 'Bonus', 'Performances', 'Music', 'Options', 'music', 'only', 'music', 'w/narration', 'other', 'videos', 'Acacia.The', 'other', 'videos', 'clips', 'are', 'Hemalayaa', 'Yoga', 'young', 'bodies', '1:30', 'Yoga', 'Trance', 'Dance', ':30', 'Duncan', 'Wong', 'awakening', 'level', ':30', 'awesome', 'Elaine', 'Petrone', 'Method', '9:44', 'lot', 'video', 'testimonials', 'Bonus', 'Performance', 'was', 'same', 'music', 'showing', 'Hemalayaa', 'w/two', 'girls', 'slow', 'motion', 'fade', 'clips', 'dancing', 'almost', '3', 'min', 'then', 'Hemalayaa', 'alone', '3', 'min', 'w/paused', 'video', 'slow', 'mo', 'double', 'video', 'effects', 'etc', 'make', 'dancing', 'look', 'better', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'along', 'intro', 'Hemalayaa', 'Bangra', 'Northern', 'India', 'dance', 'big', 'bold', 'sassy', 'outrageous', 'modern', 'dance', 'hip-hop', 'even', 'belly', '2', 'backup', 'dancers', 'are', 'Juju', 'Kimberly', 'who', 'also', 'stage', 'director', 'consultant', 'credits', 'dancers', 'were', 'dead', 'last', 'very', 'unusual.The', 'chapters', 'are', 'Warming', '6', 'min', 'Playtime', 'Begins', '7', 'min', 'Footwork', '6', 'min', 'Now', ""'re"", 'hot', '8', 'min', 'Ground', 'Play', '6', 'min', 'Playful', 'Dance', '5', 'min', 'Cook', 'now', '9', 'min', 'set', 'gorgeous', 'colors', 'textures', 'music', 'fun', 'looped', 'few', 'seconds', 'annoying', 'while', 'wanting', 'hear', 'rest', 'song.One', 'dancers', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'next', 'move', 'was', 'herself', 'many', 'times', 'annoying', 'shows', 'did', ""n't"", 'practice', 'enough', 'voice', 'cuing', 'was', 'ok', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'break', 'anything', 'down', 'really', 'give', 'body', 'movement', 'instruction', 'help', 'understand', 'how', 'move', 'easy', 'moves', ""n't"", 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'get', 'down', 'let', 'go', 'get', 'sassy', 'dance', 'one', 'watching', 'playful', 'dance', 'portion', 'where', 'alone', 'kinda', 'routine', 'very', 'repetitious', 'do', 'goddess', 'move', 'where', 'move', 'forward', 'tv', 'pushing', 'one', 'hip', 'leading', 'then', 'literal', 'hip-hop', 'running', 'man', 'moving', 'backwards', 'more', 'simplified/corny', 'style', 'alternate', 'said', 'natural', 'go', 'together', 'running', 'man', 'RUNNING', 'AWAY..', 'actually', 'running', 'fwd', 'goddess', 'Which', 'NO', 'were', 'good', 'ones', 'very', 'few', 'got', 'bored', 'repetition', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'lot', 'hopping', 'hopping', '3x', 'row', 'one', 'side', 'hop', 'wiggle', 'gluts', 'then', 'other', 'many', 'times', 'other', 'moves', 'pony', '50s', 'Indian', 'style', 'other', 'moves', 'have', 'knee', 'lifts.The', 'idea', 'there', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Hemalayaa', 'style', 'think', 'ability', 'dance', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'be', 'teaching', 'found', 'following', 'background', 'dancer', 'who', 'knew', 'routine', 'instead.If', 'want', 'hybrid', 'Indian', 'dance', 'corny', 'silly', 'let', 'go', 'easy', 'silly', 'you.You', 'can', 'see', 'preview', 'distributer', 'Acacia', 'com']",The Bollywood Dance Workout with Hemalayaa

1026604,AWMU4C4CH21TE,B000JJ4DF0,YogaGirl,"[7, 7]","So based on all of these reviews, I got this DVD and did it this morning.Setting:  Teacher + 2 dancers in a room with an Indian rug on the floor.  The background dancers are the most uninspiring dancers I have ever seen on a workout video.  The one on the right (your right) is stiff, uncoordinated and rhythmless.  Who is she?  She must be a friend of Hemalayaa.  Luckily she is blocked in most of the camera shots. Sorry if this is cruel but in a workout video you at least want the dancers to look like they are having fun AND can do the moves. Neither one of them were good at isolations. The people doing the workout can be uncoordinated, not the actors!!Music:  It is canned Bhangra music.  Not that good.  Better music can be found on Jain's Bhangra Masala workouts.  That music is percussion and really motivates you to groove.  This music doesn't.  Also H. is in voiceover and she is much louder than the music.  So if you turn your TV up, she just gets louder and the music volume stays the same.  Next time I do it I will use the music only section as sometimes H. is counting and it doesn't match the moves or the music. Sorry I am blessed with rhythm and I can't stand being off beat. UPDATE: Just did it with music only.  Somewhat better, but I can't see it being in my dvd rotation.  I'll probably just toss it. Still looking for a dance dvd that can compete with Soul Sweat.Choreography:  Simple but high impact. Not exciting.  No modifications.  Hip shimmies. Hopping on one foot. Turns (not good on my carpet, but I managed), lots of shoulders, head shakes. There is a warm up, footwork, and 2 aerobic sections, on the floor and cool down.  The best section is when H. is dancing by herself as she is energetic and all of her body parts move with the music as opposed to her ""sisters"".  I must say that sometimes the steps are out of sync with the music; the background dancers moved in the opposite direction than H.,and sometimes the fade in and out editing caused rhythm problems. All of this could have been fixed with better editing.Overall:  I sort of liked it.  I did her Dosha yoga Vata segment after the DVD to stretch some more.  My knees do hurt because you do plie bounces and lots of hopping around. Will I do this again.  Jury's out, I'll try it with just music and see how it goes. Sort of disappointed 'cause  I really needed another DVD to alternate with Soul Sweat.  By the way, get that DVD.  You will love it.  I sweated and felt like I worked out but I didn't feel satisfied like I do after Soul Sweat. I guess, I'm just a big Nia fan. I'm still waiting for someone to come out with a kick [...] Bhangra workout DVD.  Maybe Sarina Jain will come out with Vol. 6 soon!! Please!!! Bhangra music is so great and this DVD didn't do it justice.",3,Okay workout; Music could be much better,1173225600,"03 7, 2007",2007,2778,"['So', 'based', 'reviews', 'got', 'DVD', 'did', 'morning.Setting', 'Teacher', '+', '2', 'dancers', 'room', 'Indian', 'rug', 'floor', 'background', 'dancers', 'are', 'most', 'uninspiring', 'dancers', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'workout', 'video', 'one', 'right', 'right', 'stiff', 'uncoordinated', 'rhythmless', 'Who', 'must', 'be', 'friend', 'Hemalayaa', 'Luckily', 'blocked', 'most', 'camera', 'shots', 'Sorry', 'cruel', 'workout', 'video', 'least', 'want', 'dancers', 'look', 'are', 'having', 'fun', 'can', 'do', 'moves', 'one', 'were', 'good', 'isolations', 'people', 'doing', 'workout', 'can', 'be', 'uncoordinated', 'not', 'actors', 'Music', 'canned', 'Bhangra', 'music', 'Not', 'good', 'Better', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'Jain', 'Bhangra', 'Masala', 'workouts', 'music', 'percussion', 'really', 'groove', 'music', ""n't"", 'Also', 'H.', 'voiceover', 'much', 'louder', 'music', 'So', 'turn', 'TV', 'up', 'just', 'louder', 'music', 'volume', 'same', 'Next', 'time', 'do', 'will', 'use', 'music', 'only', 'section', 'sometimes', 'H.', 'counting', ""n't"", 'match', 'moves', 'music', 'Sorry', 'am', 'blessed', 'rhythm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'being', 'off', 'beat', 'UPDATE', 'Just', 'did', 'music', 'only', 'Somewhat', 'better', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'being', 'dvd', 'rotation', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'just', 'toss', 'Still', 'looking', 'dance', 'dvd', 'can', 'compete', 'Soul', 'Sweat.Choreography', 'Simple', 'high', 'impact', 'Not', 'exciting', 'modifications', 'Hip', 'shimmies', 'Hopping', 'one', 'foot', 'Turns', 'not', 'good', 'carpet', 'managed', 'lots', 'shoulders', 'head', 'shakes', 'warm', 'up', 'footwork', '2', 'aerobic', 'sections', 'floor', 'cool', 'down', 'best', 'section', 'when', 'H.', 'dancing', 'energetic', 'body', 'parts', 'move', 'music', 'opposed', 'sisters', 'must', 'say', 'sometimes', 'steps', 'are', 'sync', 'music', 'background', 'dancers', 'moved', 'opposite', 'direction', 'H.', 'sometimes', 'fade', 'editing', 'caused', 'rhythm', 'problems', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'fixed', 'better', 'editing.Overall', 'sort', 'liked', 'did', 'Dosha', 'Vata', 'segment', 'DVD', 'stretch', 'more', 'knees', 'do', 'hurt', 'do', 'plie', 'bounces', 'lots', 'hopping', 'around', 'Will', 'do', 'again', 'Jury', 'out', ""'ll"", 'try', 'just', 'music', 'see', 'how', 'Sort', 'disappointed', 'really', 'needed', 'DVD', 'alternate', 'Soul', 'Sweat', 'way', 'get', 'DVD', 'will', 'love', 'sweated', 'felt', 'worked', 'out', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'satisfied', 'do', 'Soul', 'Sweat', 'guess', ""'m"", 'just', 'big', 'Nia', 'fan', ""'m"", 'still', 'waiting', 'someone', 'come', 'out', 'kick', '[', ']', 'Bhangra', 'workout', 'DVD', 'Maybe', 'Sarina', 'Jain', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'Vol', '6', 'soon', 'Please', 'Bhangra', 'music', 'so', 'great', 'DVD', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice']",The Bollywood Dance Workout with Hemalayaa
