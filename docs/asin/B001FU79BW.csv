Carey ""waymorefun""","[0, 0]","We lost Jim way too early, he was such a talented singer, songwriter and storyteller that even today so many years after he died he is still relevant and great to listen to.  His music runs the gamut from pure fun, to beautiful love songs.  He also had a way about him that made you want to hear what he had to say.  This is a good look at him and his contributions to our world and should be enjoyed by all.",5,Amazing talent,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,408,"['lost', 'Jim', 'way', 'too', 'early', 'was', 'such', 'talented', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'storyteller', 'even', 'today', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'died', 'still', 'relevant', 'great', 'listen', 'music', 'gamut', 'pure', 'fun', 'beautiful', 'love', 'songs', 'also', 'had', 'way', 'made', 'want', 'hear', 'what', 'had', 'say', 'good', 'look', 'contributions', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyed']",N/A

I too, have become a fan of Jim Croce and this DVD is better than I expected. It's about an hour of live television performances and the DVD has a separate commentary by his wife, Ingrid.Some other reviewers have listed the songs/videos, so take a look at those for the details. I can say the quality is good considering the videos are from various live television performances (two are slideshows). Seeing Jim's facial expressions as he performs really elevates the listening enjoyment of his music.If you're a Jim Croce fan and you don't have any DVDs of his live performances, then I highly recommend you get this one.Hope that helps!",5,Better Than Expected!,1328659200,"02 8, 2012",2012,862,"['Purchased', 'directly', 'Amazon', '13.49.Recently', 'local', 'PBS', 'station', 'aired', 'edited', 'version', 'DVD', 'immediately', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'early', '30s', 'Croce', 'time', 'asked', 'see', 'could', 'get', 'too', 'have', 'become', 'fan', 'Jim', 'Croce', 'DVD', 'better', 'expected', 'hour', 'live', 'television', 'performances', 'DVD', 'separate', 'commentary', 'wife', 'Ingrid.Some', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'listed', 'songs/videos', 'so', 'take', 'look', 'details', 'can', 'say', 'quality', 'good', 'considering', 'videos', 'are', 'various', 'live', 'television', 'performances', 'two', 'are', 'slideshows', 'Seeing', 'Jim', 'facial', 'expressions', 'really', 'listening', 'enjoyment', 'music.If', ""'re"", 'Jim', 'Croce', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'DVDs', 'live', 'performances', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'get', 'one.Hope']",N/A

His stories about how he got to writing certain hit songs are very interesting.  His singing voice is great and the voice quality overall on the video is very good.  The family photos and background are a nice touch.  I thought this would be more of a live concert with a lot of audience feedback, but it is just a series of clips, many without an audience.  But it's still better than just listening to a greatest hits CD.",4,Croce Fans Will Enjoy,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",2012,587,"['2012', 'standards', 'video', 'really', 'lacking', ""'re"", 'Jim', 'Croce', 'fan', 'know', 'only', 'video', 'available', 'singer', 'then', 'worth', 'having', 'stories', 'how', 'got', 'writing', 'certain', 'hit', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'singing', 'voice', 'great', 'voice', 'quality', 'overall', 'video', 'very', 'good', 'family', 'photos', 'background', 'are', 'nice', 'touch', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'live', 'concert', 'lot', 'audience', 'feedback', 'just', 'series', 'clips', 'many', 'audience', 'still', 'better', 'just', 'listening', 'greatest', 'hits', 'CD']",N/A

Jim Croce was an amazing part of the 1970's culture and he like many before died way too young.
