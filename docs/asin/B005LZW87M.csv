Pretty much today's horror genre. What? You thought I was talking about this? I may as well have been, it follows in the footsteps of the excessively popular found-footage film genre and throws in nearly every trope in today's horror and amplifies it to be worse than it had been before.You have 6 contestants from across the U.S., coming together to stay in one mansion for one week, doing a task every night (that also follows every mindless horror clich&eacute;), and it's up to each one of them if they will stay for the next night of... ""terror"" or if they will leave and let the money be equalized among those left behind. Too bad there are problems for each of them. Some don't believe in ghosts, are staunch believers that they will not encounter anything and are there strictly to collect their due by week's end.Others have strange secrets. Let's see... an imbalance between male and female contestants? Check. One of the ladies being a blonde? Yep. Gotta be an American horror film, all right. At first, just a couple of standard little jumps (and one guy constantly complaining that people ""shouldn't do that!"" more frequently than I can tolerate, proving his claim that he's easily scared (like when one of the ladies is just staring into a tiny cellar and he's a broken ""No!"" record and doesn't know how to see she wasn't going in anyway, it made me wonder if he needed new glasses)) then the s&eacute;ance scene. Blond takes lead, but, despite her claim of having experience in the supernatural, and having done s&eacute;ances before, her motormouth and excessively ""passionate"" attitude about the whole thing (less than half of what she says makes any sense) proves she doesn't know what she's talking about. And yet, that's where the bizarre starts happening.Like the general sense of time and where things belong starts evaporating away. Nobody's logically thinking through anything they say (constantly challenging one another over the simplest things and they seem like they have no clue on anything anyways), and even the most ""expert"" of the bunch constantly has a macho mouth with no brains behind his words.And it's too bad a lot of the ghostly special effects are more 2nd-rate than anything, including the ghost in the stall (too cheesy for me to even feign jumping). Got a couple ghosts who think they were from The Ring, one that looks like it was related to Ju-On, and, okay, the walking doll actually was a chilling eerie sight, but it didn't help the rest of the so-called scares.Oh, and if you watch this, stick around for after the first part of the end credits for a little extra footage that only makes half sense.",1,I'll take the prize money,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",2013,2791,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'when', 'have', '6', 'grown', 'adults', 'sense', 'save', 'lives', 'next', 'patience', 'anything', 'total', 'madness', 'hope', 'Pretty', 'much', 'today', 'horror', 'genre', 'What', 'thought', 'was', 'talking', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'footsteps', 'excessively', 'popular', 'found-footage', 'film', 'genre', 'throws', 'nearly', 'trope', 'today', 'horror', 'amplifies', 'be', 'worse', 'had', 'been', 'before.You', 'have', '6', 'contestants', 'U.S.', 'coming', 'together', 'stay', 'one', 'mansion', 'one', 'week', 'doing', 'task', 'night', 'also', 'mindless', 'horror', 'clich', 'eacute', 'up', 'one', 'will', 'stay', 'next', 'night', 'terror', 'will', 'leave', 'let', 'money', 'be', 'equalized', 'left', 'behind', 'Too', 'bad', 'are', 'problems', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'ghosts', 'are', 'staunch', 'believers', 'will', 'not', 'encounter', 'anything', 'are', 'there', 'strictly', 'collect', 'due', 'week', 'end.Others', 'have', 'strange', 'secrets', 'Let', 'see', 'imbalance', 'male', 'female', 'contestants', 'Check', 'One', 'ladies', 'being', 'blonde', 'Yep', 'Got', 'ta', 'be', 'American', 'horror', 'film', 'right', 'first', 'just', 'couple', 'standard', 'little', 'jumps', 'one', 'guy', 'constantly', 'complaining', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'more', 'frequently', 'can', 'tolerate', 'proving', 'claim', 'easily', 'scared', 'when', 'one', 'ladies', 'just', 'staring', 'tiny', 'cellar', 'broken', 'record', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'anyway', 'made', 'wonder', 'needed', 'new', 'glasses', 'then', 's', 'eacute', 'ance', 'scene', 'Blond', 'lead', 'claim', 'having', 'experience', 'supernatural', 'having', 'done', 's', 'eacute', 'ances', 'motormouth', 'excessively', 'passionate', 'attitude', 'whole', 'thing', 'less', 'half', 'what', 'sense', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'talking', 'yet', 'where', 'bizarre', 'general', 'sense', 'time', 'where', 'things', 'belong', 'starts', 'evaporating', 'away', 'Nobody', 'logically', 'thinking', 'anything', 'say', 'constantly', 'challenging', 'one', 'simplest', 'things', 'seem', 'have', 'clue', 'anything', 'anyways', 'even', 'most', 'expert', 'bunch', 'constantly', 'macho', 'mouth', 'brains', 'words.And', 'too', 'bad', 'lot', 'ghostly', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'more', '2nd-rate', 'anything', 'including', 'ghost', 'stall', 'too', 'cheesy', 'even', 'feign', 'jumping', 'Got', 'couple', 'ghosts', 'who', 'think', 'were', 'Ring', 'one', 'was', 'related', 'Ju-On', 'okay', 'walking', 'doll', 'actually', 'was', 'chilling', 'eerie', 'sight', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'rest', 'so-called', 'scares.Oh', 'watch', 'stick', 'around', 'first', 'part', 'end', 'little', 'extra', 'footage', 'only', 'half', 'sense']",7 Nights of Darkness

""7 Nights"" wasn't too bad, but it fell short on a few things. One of my fellow reviewers, Miss Catherine, pointed out that the ""abandoned asylum"" setting was definitely flawed. Everything looked WAY too modern, for one. The furniture looked like your standard run-of-the-mill office furniture you'd expect to find in an office setting. But the hardest thing for me to get past was some of the acting. These were supposed to be people who weren't scared of ghosts, yet the ladies kept screaming at any movement. Quite annoying.

Randall ""WildHorseWoman""","[0, 1]","After reading some of the negative reviews I felt compelled to offer another view,  First let me say I firmly believe a 'good' or 'bad' movie is purely subjective, everyone will draw their own conclusions from their watching experience.  For me, this was a really creepy movie with very good 'made ya jump' scares.  I appreciated the absence of rivers of blood, gore or slashing, just wish they could have cut down the number of f-bombs.  Also, this is a &#34;lost/found video&#34; movie, which I personally like a lot,So, as stated, the story revolves around 6 contestants who must stay in this abandoned asylum for 7 days, if they do they will receive 1/6th share of a million dollars.  The more players who leave then, the more money each could make.  They are also tasked with one 'must do' chore  each night; ie, &#34;explore the basement and first floor&#34;.  Okay, good premise as far as I'm concerned.  The characters are all very different individuals, and yes, one or two are annoying, but that's just a counter-point and don't all movies like this have a jackass or two?  I've read that the acting was terrible, I beg to differ, I thought the actors were very believable.  I actually looked at them and thought they were truly afraid going down the pitch-black halls with just flashlights, who wouldn't be if you were in an old building at night?  I heard nervous giggles, the kind that slip out when you're trying to convince others you aren't frightened.So, all in all, I'd say  7 Nights of Darkness is a fun ride, a good scarey journey, and you'll want to wait for the credits to run ALL the way through for a little extra surprise.

First off, as they pretend to be a reality show, they have boring one on one interviews with the contestants. We already know this is a film and scripted. These type of interviews are boring in reality TV shows, now we get to watch boring ones which we know are fake. I couldn't figure out the cameras as they would swap from great color to grainy black and white for no reason, even during the day.

The film doesn't leave you with an explanation, although a better sequel with a better script and better actors is possible.
