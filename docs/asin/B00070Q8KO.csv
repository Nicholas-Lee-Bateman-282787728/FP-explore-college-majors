876497,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,B00070Q8KO,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[7, 9]","One of the great things about A Snake of June is the use of the blue lens/filter through which this black and white film was shot. As the cinematographer explains in one of the two excellent extra featurettes that come with the DVD, the blue was used to give the feeling of water. June is the rainy month in Japan and just like in the film Seven, it rains throughout the entire film.The combination of the blue tint/tinge, the rain, and the growing eroticism should have resulted in a building of intensity, which did take place in Tsukamoto (the director)'s films Iron Man and Body Hammer. But the problem in A Snake of June is that once a certain degree of intensity is reached, there is not much more that can be done. So the film, while not floundering, does not really leave the viewer satisfied, so to speak, once about the midpoint has come and gone.Even though Rinko, the female protagonist, does become sexier past that midpoint mark, the intensity that is piled on--among other things, using a surreal peep show that kind of bursts into view out of the blue (so to speak)--does not really add anything. In fact, the peep show and the appearance of an appendage that definitely recalls Iron Man seem much more forced and tacked on here than similar events do in either Iron Man or Body Hammer (the Iron Man sequel).Tsukamoto himself has a leading role in this film; he's the stalker that galvanizes the action, the catalyst that transforms Rinko from a shy social worker into a walking object of pleasure. Her husband sleeps on a couch, typically, and this for a woman can be frustrating, just like it would for a man if his wife did the same thing.It would have been a much better film if there had been a stronger emphasis on Rinko's psychology. In Iron Man and Body Hammer, there was no need to focus on these internal elements because the external ones of flesh becoming metal were so bizarre that there was no need for an internal focus. But in A Snake of June, Tsukamoto turns his intent and attention inward, or tries to, but he doesn't go far enough.This should have been a much better film that it is.",3,Not as strong as it should have been,1119052800,"06 18, 2005",2005,2119,"['One', 'great', 'things', 'Snake', 'June', 'use', 'blue', 'lens/filter', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'cinematographer', 'one', 'two', 'excellent', 'extra', 'featurettes', 'come', 'DVD', 'blue', 'was', 'used', 'give', 'feeling', 'water', 'June', 'rainy', 'month', 'Japan', 'just', 'film', 'Seven', 'entire', 'film.The', 'combination', 'blue', 'tint/tinge', 'rain', 'growing', 'eroticism', 'should', 'have', 'resulted', 'building', 'intensity', 'did', 'take', 'place', 'Tsukamoto', 'director', 'films', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Body', 'Hammer', 'problem', 'Snake', 'June', 'once', 'certain', 'degree', 'intensity', 'reached', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'film', 'not', 'floundering', 'not', 'really', 'leave', 'viewer', 'satisfied', 'speak', 'once', 'midpoint', 'come', 'gone.Even', 'Rinko', 'female', 'protagonist', 'become', 'sexier', 'midpoint', 'mark', 'intensity', 'piled', 'other', 'things', 'using', 'surreal', 'peep', 'show', 'kind', 'bursts', 'view', 'blue', 'so', 'speak', 'not', 'really', 'add', 'anything', 'fact', 'peep', 'show', 'appearance', 'appendage', 'definitely', 'Iron', 'Man', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'forced', 'tacked', 'here', 'similar', 'events', 'do', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Body', 'Hammer', 'Iron', 'Man', 'sequel', '.Tsukamoto', 'leading', 'role', 'film', 'stalker', 'action', 'catalyst', 'Rinko', 'shy', 'social', 'worker', 'walking', 'object', 'pleasure', 'husband', 'sleeps', 'couch', 'typically', 'woman', 'can', 'be', 'frustrating', 'just', 'would', 'man', 'wife', 'did', 'same', 'thing.It', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'stronger', 'emphasis', 'Rinko', 'psychology', 'Iron', 'Man', 'Body', 'Hammer', 'was', 'need', 'focus', 'internal', 'elements', 'external', 'ones', 'flesh', 'becoming', 'metal', 'were', 'so', 'bizarre', 'was', 'need', 'internal', 'focus', 'A', 'Snake', 'June', 'Tsukamoto', 'intent', 'attention', 'inward', 'tries', ""n't"", 'go', 'far', 'enough.This', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'film']",A Snake of June

876499,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00070Q8KO,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","A Snake of June (Shinya Tsukamoto, 2002)There are those, and they are legion, who find those of us who contend that the Japanese simply make better movies overall than the Americans these days are just some sort of film snobs with a fetish for foreignness. I would answer that those people should, as just one example of what I'm talking about, take A Snake of June and hold it up against any American sexual psychodrama of the past twenty years (and, come to think of it, the only one I can really find to compare it to is Jane Campion's woefully terrible In the Cut). The simple fact of the matter is that Americans, whether it be filmmakers themselves or the studios who distribute the films, simply aren't capable of coming up with stuff like this. It's just not in our nature or something.The tale follows Iguchi (Shinya Tsukamoto), who begins as a suicidal photographer. He calls a suicide hotline and is talked out of killing himself by Rinko (Asuka Kurosawa). He grows obsessed with her and her husband Shigehiko (Yuji Kohtari) and begins stalking them, setting in motion events that will take all three on journeys of self-revelation.That's a woefully incomplete synopsis, but little revelations (such as why Iguchi was suicidal in the first place, and how he makes his presence known to Rinko) pop up sporadically throughout the film that ripple into the greater revelations, and so pretty much everything in the film after the first ten minutes or so is a spoiler. All I can do is say ""trust me, the plot's taken care of."" And it's a fine plot, if a bit impressionist (this should be no surprise to those who are already familiar with Tsukamoto's work). The actors are very good at what they do, and all the other technical details are nicely done. But what makes this film so compelling is, of course, Shinya Tsukamoto's vision, both literally and figuratively. Figuratively because it's hard to imagine, here in America, that films can still be this deliciously shocking; literally because Kaijyu Theater films have a certain look to them. Shinya Tsukamoto has gotten away from the biotechnological obsessions of his earlier films, but he has retained much of the visual style that made Tetsuo such a nightmarish experience; years of practice, of course, have honed it somewhat, and toning down the subject matter brings the visual style a bit more into focus. It's a kind of blend of the Hong Kong martial arts flick and Polanski's Knife in the Water, if that makes any sense.This is very, very good stuff, and well worth tracking down. ****",4,The movie that should make Shinya Tsukamoto famous in America.,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,2555,"['Snake', 'June', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', '2002', 'are', 'are', 'legion', 'who', 'find', 'who', 'contend', 'Japanese', 'simply', 'make', 'better', 'movies', 'overall', 'Americans', 'days', 'are', 'just', 'sort', 'film', 'snobs', 'fetish', 'foreignness', 'would', 'answer', 'people', 'should', 'just', 'one', 'example', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'take', 'Snake', 'June', 'hold', 'up', 'American', 'sexual', 'psychodrama', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'come', 'think', 'only', 'one', 'can', 'really', 'find', 'compare', 'Jane', 'Campion', 'woefully', 'terrible', 'Cut', 'simple', 'fact', 'matter', 'Americans', 'be', 'filmmakers', 'studios', 'who', 'distribute', 'films', 'simply', 'are', ""n't"", 'capable', 'coming', 'up', 'stuff', 'just', 'not', 'nature', 'something.The', 'tale', 'Iguchi', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'who', 'suicidal', 'photographer', 'suicide', 'hotline', 'talked', 'killing', 'Rinko', 'Asuka', 'Kurosawa', 'obsessed', 'husband', 'Shigehiko', 'Yuji', 'Kohtari', 'stalking', 'setting', 'motion', 'events', 'will', 'take', 'three', 'journeys', 'self-revelation.That', 'woefully', 'incomplete', 'synopsis', 'little', 'revelations', 'such', 'why', 'Iguchi', 'was', 'suicidal', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'presence', 'known', 'Rinko', 'pop', 'up', 'sporadically', 'film', 'greater', 'revelations', 'so', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'film', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'spoiler', 'can', 'do', 'say', 'trust', 'plot', 'taken', 'care', 'fine', 'plot', 'bit', 'impressionist', 'should', 'be', 'surprise', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'familiar', 'Tsukamoto', 'work', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'other', 'technical', 'details', 'are', 'nicely', 'done', 'what', 'film', 'so', 'compelling', 'course', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'vision', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'Figuratively', 'hard', 'imagine', 'here', 'America', 'films', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'deliciously', 'shocking', 'literally', 'Kaijyu', 'Theater', 'films', 'have', 'certain', 'look', 'Shinya', 'Tsukamoto', 'gotten', 'away', 'biotechnological', 'obsessions', 'earlier', 'films', 'retained', 'much', 'visual', 'style', 'made', 'Tetsuo', 'nightmarish', 'experience', 'years', 'practice', 'course', 'have', 'honed', 'somewhat', 'toning', 'down', 'subject', 'matter', 'visual', 'style', 'bit', 'more', 'focus', 'kind', 'blend', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'Polanski', 'Knife', 'Water', 'sense.This', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'stuff', 'well', 'tracking', 'down', '****']",A Snake of June

876501,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B00070Q8KO,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[15, 15]","Just as twistedly brilliant as Tetsuo, though slightly less hyperkinetic, Tsukamoto's A Snake of June explores similar themes of repressed sexuality and contrasting worlds, but with a far more linear plotline. Though metallic phallus imagery and psychosexual encounters do make an appearance.When suicide hotline counselor Rinko (Asuka Kurosawa) receives explicit photos of herself from a mysterious caller, she is thrown into a depraved game of hidden fantasies and unrestrained sexual desire. As the voyeuristic stalker becomes determined to alter her passionless life, Rinko's compulsively clean husband Shigehiko (Yuji Koutari) attempts to hunt him down and the three disillusioned soul's paths will inevitably intertwine.Tsukamoto's visual style is unmistakably daring and A Snake of June is no exception. Bathed in blue to suggest the unrelenting presence of water, the images created are painstakingly crafted and unforgettably bizarre. Close-ups of snails, drains, and circular windows mix with frantic shots of action and nightmarishly surreal dreams pepper reality. Far more linear than some of Tsukamoto's previous efforts, there's still plenty of hallucinatory imagery to comprehend, most memorably the sex show dream sequence accenting the themes of voyeurism and the contrast of viewing the organic through circles. Frenetic editing and dizzying camerawork also strive to keep this thriller from ever slowing down, and even during extended single shots on a stationary subject, the camera refuses to stay put, heightening the sense of voyeurism and paranoia. Even in the chapter breaks Tsukamoto's maddeningly creative artistry is at work as curious symbols denote the passing of time and the gradual joining of figures.To match the delirious visuals is a fantastically diverse array of sound effects and music from composer Chu Ishikawa. Unending rain echoes in every scene and foreboding strings alternate the mood from morose to morbid, yet there's always a calming satisfaction from the violins. Percussive tribalistic music heavy with the sounds of clanging metal enhances the tense scenes of violence and operatic tones waft through the more surrealistic segments.With disturbing imagery reminiscent of David Lynch's Eraserhead (but with more meaningful parallels and less unexplained randomness), A Snake of June is a brilliant examination of voyeurism, buried desires, and suppressed passion through the looking glass of a twisted genius. Tsukamoto again proves he is the master of the sadistically surreal and has long since passed his American counterparts in both style and presentation.- Joel Massie",4,A Snake of June Movie Review,1196208000,"11 28, 2007",2007,2625,"['Just', 'twistedly', 'brilliant', 'Tetsuo', 'though', 'slightly', 'less', 'hyperkinetic', 'Tsukamoto', 'A', 'Snake', 'June', 'explores', 'similar', 'themes', 'repressed', 'sexuality', 'contrasting', 'worlds', 'far', 'more', 'linear', 'plotline', 'metallic', 'imagery', 'psychosexual', 'encounters', 'do', 'make', 'appearance.When', 'suicide', 'hotline', 'counselor', 'Rinko', 'Asuka', 'Kurosawa', 'explicit', 'photos', 'mysterious', 'caller', 'thrown', 'depraved', 'game', 'hidden', 'fantasies', 'unrestrained', 'sexual', 'desire', 'voyeuristic', 'stalker', 'becomes', 'determined', 'alter', 'passionless', 'life', 'Rinko', 'compulsively', 'clean', 'husband', 'Shigehiko', 'Yuji', 'Koutari', 'hunt', 'down', 'three', 'disillusioned', 'soul', 'paths', 'will', 'inevitably', 'intertwine.Tsukamoto', 'visual', 'style', 'unmistakably', 'daring', 'A', 'Snake', 'June', 'exception', 'Bathed', 'blue', 'suggest', 'unrelenting', 'presence', 'water', 'images', 'created', 'are', 'painstakingly', 'crafted', 'unforgettably', 'bizarre', 'Close-ups', 'snails', 'drains', 'circular', 'windows', 'mix', 'frantic', 'shots', 'action', 'nightmarishly', 'surreal', 'dreams', 'pepper', 'reality', 'Far', 'more', 'linear', 'Tsukamoto', 'previous', 'efforts', 'still', 'plenty', 'hallucinatory', 'imagery', 'comprehend', 'most', 'memorably', 'sex', 'show', 'dream', 'sequence', 'accenting', 'themes', 'voyeurism', 'contrast', 'viewing', 'organic', 'circles', 'Frenetic', 'editing', 'dizzying', 'camerawork', 'also', 'strive', 'keep', 'thriller', 'ever', 'slowing', 'down', 'even', 'extended', 'single', 'shots', 'stationary', 'subject', 'camera', 'stay', 'put', 'heightening', 'sense', 'voyeurism', 'paranoia', 'Even', 'chapter', 'Tsukamoto', 'maddeningly', 'creative', 'artistry', 'work', 'curious', 'symbols', 'denote', 'passing', 'time', 'gradual', 'joining', 'figures.To', 'match', 'delirious', 'visuals', 'fantastically', 'diverse', 'array', 'sound', 'effects', 'music', 'composer', 'Chu', 'Ishikawa', 'Unending', 'rain', 'echoes', 'scene', 'foreboding', 'strings', 'alternate', 'mood', 'morose', 'morbid', 'always', 'calming', 'satisfaction', 'violins', 'Percussive', 'tribalistic', 'music', 'heavy', 'sounds', 'clanging', 'metal', 'tense', 'scenes', 'violence', 'operatic', 'tones', 'more', 'surrealistic', 'segments.With', 'disturbing', 'imagery', 'reminiscent', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Eraserhead', 'more', 'meaningful', 'parallels', 'less', 'unexplained', 'randomness', 'A', 'Snake', 'June', 'brilliant', 'examination', 'voyeurism', 'buried', 'desires', 'suppressed', 'passion', 'looking', 'glass', 'twisted', 'genius', 'Tsukamoto', 'again', 'master', 'sadistically', 'surreal', 'long', 'passed', 'American', 'counterparts', 'style', 'presentation.-', 'Joel', 'Massie']",A Snake of June

She has become something of an invisible persona, after all, living with a husband that does not notice her any more. Along with that, she also has something that is doing something to her, making her wonder if there really is beauty left inside her or not. This leads her to do things, more and more on the voyeuristic side of the fence, with someone leading her to push things even further. Then her husband finds some push and, amidst everything, the changes begin to take root.When I first saw A Snake of June, I did not know what to think of it. It had a lot of visuals and a lot of expressions hidden inside of it, but the main themes were also really compelling. Here you have a family that has become a routine and a routine alone, and this seems to sit with the wife in a bad way. The husband seems to find himself needing more as well, and this brings about something that starts a transition. The transition is sexual, deviant, and embarassingly enjoyable to watch, not to mention strange in a not-so-subtle way.Add this to the great acting and the idea behind it all and you have a grand thing that is easily missed.Should you get this? Depends on your idea of good cinema. You like nudity and you like torment as well? Then you will enjoy this.
