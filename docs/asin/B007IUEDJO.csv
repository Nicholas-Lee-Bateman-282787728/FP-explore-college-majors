1531482,A3K6FXL68M7IED,B007IUEDJO,"Cheryl C. Malandrinos ""johnnycat15""","[8, 8]","There are so many wonderful things to say about this DVD. First, you have the element of imagination as Whyatt and his friends transform from mere mortals into their super hero personas. They fly into books to look for the answers to the questions that will solve their problems. In addition, the show is interactive, with the characters addressing the audience and taking your child on the adventure with them. Your child will enjoy singing along and solving problems alongside the Super Readers, while learning important skills like identifying letters, spelling, and reading comprehension. As a writer, I love how Super Why! can change the story with his power to read. That helps kids realize the power of words.Each episode opens with a summary of what the viewer will learn, so parents can see what will be focused on and supplement their child's learning. Extra features include fun song videos, four PC games, and coloring pages.Super Why!: Around the World Adventure DVD is a great way to get your kids ready to read!",5,Fun Learning to Get Kids Reading,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2012,1026,"['are', 'so', 'many', 'wonderful', 'things', 'say', 'DVD', 'First', 'have', 'element', 'imagination', 'Whyatt', 'friends', 'transform', 'mere', 'mortals', 'super', 'hero', 'personas', 'fly', 'books', 'look', 'answers', 'questions', 'will', 'solve', 'problems', 'addition', 'show', 'interactive', 'characters', 'addressing', 'audience', 'taking', 'child', 'adventure', 'child', 'will', 'enjoy', 'singing', 'along', 'solving', 'problems', 'Super', 'Readers', 'learning', 'important', 'skills', 'identifying', 'letters', 'spelling', 'reading', 'comprehension', 'writer', 'love', 'how', 'Super', 'Why', 'can', 'change', 'story', 'power', 'read', 'kids', 'realize', 'power', 'words.Each', 'episode', 'summary', 'what', 'viewer', 'will', 'learn', 'parents', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'focused', 'supplement', 'child', 'learning', 'Extra', 'features', 'include', 'fun', 'song', 'videos', 'four', 'PC', 'games', 'coloring', 'pages.Super', 'Why', 'World', 'Adventure', 'DVD', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'kids', 'ready', 'read']",Super Why: Around the World Adventure
