If you want a top notch quality video, then get the BD from Return To Forever, another killer performance from Al...But this one is very good.

DiMeola's legendary guitar playing goes without saying but if you want to hear the most amazing accordian playing by Fausto Beccalossie ever you will want to get this dvd. Actually you can replace the word accordian and substitute ""amazing acoustic instrument"". I've been looking for just a recording of this group ever since I saw them.This will be a real treat. The rest of the band plays at the same incredible level of mastery as Al and Fausto. Fausto also did some cool vocals.

1504252,A3T9PA1L9D6GL5,B005VQRSPS,Robert W,"[11, 14]",I respect this guy as a musician beyond most guitarists alive today. I've seen him live several times and he always puts forth an incredible performance. And the music / musicianship here is outstanding. Sound quality is good bordering on real good. DTS- Master 5.1 and stereo. Though if you're not into the last decades worth or so of the DiMeola sound...think accordion...you will not like this. Stay away if you're looking for the jazz or rock side of Al. That being said if you like his style of the last several albums you will like this.But I have to echo what others here have said. The video side of things here is poor quality. VHS tapes look as good. Don't know what they were thinking when they put this to blu ray. Also it's VERY basic editing and menus. And the endless artsy fartsy Moroccan mosaic theme that he seems to be trying to get across inturupts the concert with regularity gets old real quick.Honestly if I didn't respect him as one of the greatest guitarists of all time I'd give this whole thing one star.If you're a hard core fan it's worth having. But even as much as I like and respect him. I doubt I'll ever watch this again any time soon.,3,Cause it's Al...3 stars. Music is great.

Al Di Meola, whose music has never seriously exposed to my ears before, is such an outstanding guitarist without a doubt and leads me to a whole new world of music. Other musicians playing accordion, bongo, violin, bass and percussion are also exceptional. They altogether create fantastic sound and ensemble.The technical aspect of this blu-ray is very disappointing, however. While the DTS-HD MA 5.1 & 2.0 audio is excellent, the vision looks like SD at best. I couldn't believe my eyes at first and thought I was watching a DVD not blu-ray. It's definitely the worst-looking blu-ray I've seen. It might be due to either its transfer error or original recording source issue. I strongly believe the concert was originally recorded in 1.33:1 with SD cameras even though it was shot in 2009. In addition, from time to time, video clips (post production) are inserted during each performance, which enhances the mood at times but mostly rather distracting. Camera work is not accurate and precise. Extras are great with additional performances, rehearsals, etc.All in all, I love this ""unforgettable"" concert and can forgive all the technical issues. I just want more of Al Di Meola! I do hope more concerts from him and his band come out on blu-ray... with a true hi-def quality.",4,"Phenominal Concert, Disappointing PQ...",1327363200,"01 24, 2012",2012,1358,"['First', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'concert', 'What', 'exciting', 'music', 'treat', 'Al', 'Di', 'Meola', 'music', 'never', 'seriously', 'exposed', 'ears', 'such', 'outstanding', 'guitarist', 'doubt', 'whole', 'new', 'world', 'music', 'Other', 'musicians', 'playing', 'accordion', 'bongo', 'violin', 'bass', 'percussion', 'are', 'also', 'exceptional', 'altogether', 'create', 'fantastic', 'sound', 'ensemble.The', 'technical', 'aspect', 'blu-ray', 'very', 'disappointing', 'however', 'DTS-HD', 'MA', '5.1', '2.0', 'audio', 'excellent', 'vision', 'SD', 'best', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'eyes', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'watching', 'DVD', 'not', 'blu-ray', 'definitely', 'worst-looking', 'blu-ray', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'might', 'be', 'due', 'transfer', 'error', 'original', 'recording', 'source', 'issue', 'strongly', 'believe', 'concert', 'was', 'originally', 'recorded', '1.33:1', 'SD', 'cameras', 'even', 'was', 'shot', '2009', 'addition', 'time', 'time', 'video', 'clips', 'post', 'production', 'are', 'inserted', 'performance', 'mood', 'times', 'mostly', 'rather', 'distracting', 'Camera', 'work', 'not', 'accurate', 'precise', 'Extras', 'are', 'great', 'additional', 'performances', 'rehearsals', 'etc.All', 'love', 'unforgettable', 'concert', 'can', 'forgive', 'technical', 'issues', 'just', 'want', 'more', 'Al', 'Di', 'Meola', 'do', 'hope', 'more', 'concerts', 'band', 'come', 'out', 'blu-ray', 'true', 'hi-def', 'quality']",N/A
