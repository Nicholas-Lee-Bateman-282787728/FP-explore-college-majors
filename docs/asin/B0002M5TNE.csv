We thought this would be like some of the other dvd's ie: Mexico, Vampire, Alien invaders, Loch Ness Monster.  Our daughters still enjoyed watching them but kept saying,""Not a new show.""  But it still hasn't stopped them from watching it.  I am just disappointed that we were ripped off and bought a dvd with repeat shows....well buyer beware!!!!  Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star as per the kids.",3,"These shows are on the other DVD's Season 1, 2 and 3",1323129600,"12 6, 2011",2011,536,"['were', 'little', 'disappointed', 'fact', 'got', 'such', 'high', 'reviews', 'one', 'bothered', 'mention', 'were', 'repeats', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'other', 'dvd', 'ie', 'Mexico', 'Vampire', 'Alien', 'invaders', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'daughters', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'kept', 'saying', 'Not', 'new', 'show', 'still', ""n't"", 'stopped', 'watching', 'am', 'just', 'disappointed', 'were', 'ripped', 'off', 'bought', 'dvd', 'repeat', 'shows', '.well', 'buyer', 'beware', 'Otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'star', 'kids']",N/A
