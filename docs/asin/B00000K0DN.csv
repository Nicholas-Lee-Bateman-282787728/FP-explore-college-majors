Two images that will FOREVER stay in my mind are when the killer is looking in the window and the girl sees him in a mirror...and then when she's trying to start the car...oh my goodness!  I have not seen the DVD, but had purchased the video.  It is much easier to watch now, but that scene of him peeking in the window still weirds me out!!

508764,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B00000K0DN,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[5, 6]","One of William Castle's later efforts. ""I Saw What You Did"" was made the year after the terrific ""Strait Jacket"", and also stars Joan Crawford. She must have got on well with Castle as this was a much smaller role, in what it is a less impressive movie all round. The film stars two teenage girls who have been left to babysit the much younger sister of one of them in a remote house. To relieve the boredom, the pair decide to make lots of prank calls, whispering the movie's title down the telephone to lots of random people they pick out of the phone book. Trouble is, one of their victims really DID do something - he just murdered his wife! And once the call has been made, he decides he has to act fast and remove any potential witness.Now, on paper this all sounds like it has the potential to make a really suspenseful and exciting movie. But for some reason, Castle sabotages the atmosphere by seemingly directing it for an audience about the same age as his two girl stars. Right from the opening credits, swinging beat music blares out over shots of the two friends gossiping over the phone, followed by nearly half an hour of cutesy family orientated comedy-melodrama. It's a problem shared by the original ""13 Ghosts"", in which a similarly spooky setting was spoiled by the irritatingly humerous sparring of the happy family involved. Why does Castle do this, when he's showed he has the know-how for creating real suspense if he wants to? My only guess is that a hard-hitting, adult film about a murderer terrorising two teenagers is not what Castle felt comfortable making here. But if that is the case, why is the film (and Castle's whole career) marketed at ""scaring the pants off America"" (to quote his autobiography)? He managed to make ""Strait Jacket"", ""The Tingler"" and ""Homicidal"" pretty effective, but he really drops the ball here.Which is a shame, because in places, the film shines. The main murder, which leads to all the trouble, is a knockout. Although it's totally stolen from ""Psycho"" (it takes place in a shower), the roles of killer and victim are cleverly reversed, and it is short, sharp and surprisingly brutal. But once this is over, the plot really creaks as the machinations of the phone call and the murderer's discovery of who made it get awkwardly spun out on the screen. The script makes a real meal of setting up the drama... I'm sure they didn't need to make it quite this complicated, with lots of phoning, scheming and re-phoning going on. As a result, it takes forever for the film to reach it's climax in which the murderer finally starts terrorising the teenagers at their home, but when it does, there's some more real tension as he breaks in and starts his chase. I won't reveal the climax, but after it, as the film comes to a close, it's all ruined with a stupidly jaunty burst of music and some unbelievably inappropriate merriment (along the lines of ""That's the last crank call I'll ever make - ha ha!""), which wipes out the whole dark mood of the preceding 15 minutes. Unforgiveable.So I was disappointed. Shame really, as the two girls playing the lead roles make good work as the giggly teenagers - not too annoying, and turning realistically scared when things become nasty. Even the little sister isn't bad. Castle must really like working with children, as all his child actors seem pretty relaxed and natural to me. Joan Crawford also makes an impact, in a very small role that she's really acting too well for. It's worth re-watching just the scenes she is again a second time. And there are brief moments of very good suspense. But basically, this could be a film aimed at kids about the perils of making prank calls, in fact if you took out the rather graphic (in this context, anyway) shower murder scene, it would be little more than a piece of Saturday morning matinee fluff.",2,See What William Castle Did with a promising idea...,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,3845,"['One', 'William', 'Castle', 'later', 'efforts', 'Saw', 'What', 'Did', 'was', 'made', 'year', 'terrific', 'Strait', 'Jacket', 'also', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'must', 'have', 'got', 'well', 'Castle', 'was', 'much', 'smaller', 'role', 'what', 'less', 'impressive', 'movie', 'round', 'film', 'two', 'teenage', 'girls', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'babysit', 'much', 'younger', 'sister', 'one', 'remote', 'house', 'relieve', 'boredom', 'pair', 'decide', 'make', 'lots', 'prank', 'calls', 'whispering', 'movie', 'title', 'down', 'telephone', 'lots', 'random', 'people', 'pick', 'phone', 'book', 'Trouble', 'one', 'victims', 'really', 'DID', 'do', 'something', 'just', 'murdered', 'wife', 'once', 'call', 'been', 'made', 'act', 'fast', 'remove', 'potential', 'witness.Now', 'paper', 'potential', 'make', 'really', 'suspenseful', 'exciting', 'movie', 'reason', 'Castle', 'atmosphere', 'seemingly', 'directing', 'audience', 'same', 'age', 'two', 'girl', 'stars', 'Right', 'opening', 'credits', 'swinging', 'beat', 'music', 'out', 'shots', 'two', 'friends', 'gossiping', 'phone', 'followed', 'nearly', 'hour', 'cutesy', 'family', 'orientated', 'comedy-melodrama', 'problem', 'shared', 'original', '13', 'Ghosts', 'similarly', 'spooky', 'setting', 'was', 'spoiled', 'irritatingly', 'humerous', 'sparring', 'happy', 'family', 'involved', 'Why', 'Castle', 'do', 'when', 'showed', 'know-how', 'creating', 'real', 'suspense', 'only', 'guess', 'hard-hitting', 'adult', 'film', 'murderer', 'terrorising', 'two', 'teenagers', 'not', 'what', 'Castle', 'felt', 'comfortable', 'making', 'here', 'case', 'why', 'film', 'Castle', 'whole', 'career', 'marketed', 'scaring', 'pants', 'off', 'America', 'quote', 'autobiography', 'managed', 'make', 'Strait', 'Jacket', 'Tingler', 'Homicidal', 'pretty', 'effective', 'really', 'ball', 'here.Which', 'shame', 'places', 'film', 'shines', 'main', 'murder', 'trouble', 'knockout', 'totally', 'stolen', 'Psycho', 'place', 'shower', 'roles', 'killer', 'victim', 'are', 'cleverly', 'reversed', 'short', 'sharp', 'surprisingly', 'brutal', 'once', 'plot', 'really', 'machinations', 'phone', 'call', 'murderer', 'discovery', 'who', 'made', 'get', 'awkwardly', 'spun', 'out', 'screen', 'script', 'real', 'meal', 'setting', 'up', 'drama', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'make', 'quite', 'complicated', 'lots', 'phoning', 'scheming', 're-phoning', 'going', 'result', 'forever', 'film', 'reach', 'climax', 'murderer', 'finally', 'terrorising', 'teenagers', 'home', 'when', 'more', 'real', 'tension', 'starts', 'chase', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'climax', 'film', 'close', 'ruined', 'stupidly', 'jaunty', 'burst', 'music', 'unbelievably', 'inappropriate', 'merriment', 'lines', 'last', 'crank', 'call', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'make', 'ha', 'ha', 'out', 'whole', 'dark', 'mood', 'preceding', '15', 'minutes', 'Unforgiveable.So', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Shame', 'really', 'two', 'girls', 'playing', 'lead', 'roles', 'make', 'good', 'work', 'giggly', 'teenagers', 'not', 'too', 'annoying', 'turning', 'realistically', 'scared', 'when', 'things', 'become', 'nasty', 'Even', 'little', 'sister', ""n't"", 'bad', 'Castle', 'must', 'really', 'working', 'children', 'child', 'actors', 'seem', 'pretty', 'relaxed', 'natural', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'also', 'impact', 'very', 'small', 'role', 'really', 'acting', 'too', 'well', 'worth', 're-watching', 'just', 'scenes', 'again', 'second', 'time', 'are', 'brief', 'moments', 'very', 'good', 'suspense', 'basically', 'could', 'be', 'film', 'aimed', 'kids', 'perils', 'making', 'prank', 'calls', 'fact', 'took', 'out', 'rather', 'graphic', 'context', 'anyway', 'shower', 'murder', 'scene', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'more', 'piece', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'matinee', 'fluff']",N/A

508766,A3KNGA5WIECM5V,B00000K0DN,"Beth Fox ""Beth A. Fox""","[30, 31]","I gave this movie five stars not because it is an Oscar-quality classic - far from it - but because it succeeds on its own terms.  It is scary - very, very scary.  (If you watch it at night, I dare you to go to sleep without double-checking that the doors are locked!)  The over-the-top performances, particularly Joan Crawford's, are also unintentionally funny.  It works because the camp does not diminish the fright and the scares do not get in the way of the hilarity.Why is this movie so scary?  Others have mentioned the isolated farmhouse, the hazy atmosphere, the feeling of being alone, and the naivet&eacute; of the girls.  Although some have criticized the teen-age actors, I think the story holds together because Libby and Kit's silly behavior (trying to appear sophisticated while really looking childish) is believable of 15-year-old girls then and now.  Crawford, as a domineering neighbor, adds the camp.  The slam-the-car-door scene is priceless!  And have you ever seen a made-for-horror-movies necklace like the one Joan wears here?This is not a movie which could be made effectively now (a poor remake was made in 1988) because the plot devices demand a 1960s-type telephone system.  Today, a parent calling up to check on a child could almost always ring through on &quot;call waiting&quot;; ripping a telephone out of a wall is meaningless in the age of cell phones; and &quot;Caller ID&quot; and &quot;Call Return&quot; should make phony phone calls a thing of the past.  Even at the time, it required viewers to suspend logic to believe that Mrs. Mannering, hearing non-stop busy signals, would not demand an ""emergency cut in,"" which did exist at the time, or that this middle-class family lacked an extension phone.  But these are minor nits.The letterbox version now being sold is excellent.  Make sure you see the trailers before and, especially, after the film.

508769,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,B00000K0DN,Dave. K,"[1, 2]","I SAW WHAT YOU DID***  Out of 5Release Date- July 21st, 1965Running Time- 82-MinutesRating-Screenplay- William P. McGivern (Ursula Curtiss, Novel)Director- William CastleStarring- Andi Garrett, Sarah Lane, John Ireland, Sharyl Locke, Patricia Breslin, Leif Erickson, John Archer and Joan Crawford as Amy NelsonI Saw What You Did was released in 1965 and directed by William Castle; Castle a cult filmmaker is probably best known for his gimmicks when it comes to his work. In The Tingler certain seats would be rigged to give a zap to the viewer during the scare scenes; with 13 Ghosts the viewer could wear glasses that would allow them to see the ghosts in the house, Homicidal, had the fright meter pop up and finally Mr. Sardonicus the people in the theater voted on what ending they wanted regarding the lead character Mr. Sardonicus. These gimmicks served Castle well and while these movies still might be enjoyable those of us not old enough to see these movies during their original release are missing out.William Castle was very much a camp director who came up with gimmicks, but he can also tell a story without camp (or too much) and without gimmicks. While I like William Castle's work I wouldn't rate any of his movies among my personal favorites except the 1964 film Straight-Jacket, which was a movie without any gimmicks and in my opinion showed the talent Castle had as a filmmaker when not making anything campy or with a gimmick.I Saw What You Did is a movie without a gimmick well sort of; there were seatbelts installed in the seats at the theaters so people wouldn't jump out of their seat in fear, but this wasn't the typical Castle gimmick, but I Saw What You Did does have some camp value, which I'm not quite sure how much was intentional and I'll get more into that in just a bit.The plot is simple, but effective; Libby (Andi Garrett) is watching over her sister Tess (Sharyl Locke) while their parents are away for the night, Libby's friend Kitt (Sarah Lane) comes over to hang out with Libby and with nothing better to do the three girls start to make some prank phone calls. They call a man named Steve Marak (John Ireland), but he's in the shower and when his wife goes into the room in a fit of rage Steve murders her than later buries the body; the girls continue to make prank phone calls only now saying I know who you are and I saw what you did, they end up calling Steve back and say this and of course the girls are unknown to what he actually did, but Steve doesn't know that.The screenplay by William P. McGivern was based off a novel by Ursula Curtiss; since I've never read the novel I cannot compare the two or what was changed. The script was fairly well written with some decent character development; while the characters don't have a lot of depth McGivern does a good enough job in giving some insight to what the girls are like. Some of the dialogue was a bit silly in some spots and Libby actually goes to Steve's house to see what he looks like and I'm not sure about that. That seems a bit out there, but than again teenagers are known to do some stupid things so I guess it's possible for this to happen. The three main characters are slightly annoying at times, but teenagers and children can sometimes be annoying so the script sort of works due to that. The screenplay is hardly anything special and does have some silly moments, but it serves its purpose.Director William Castle does a fairly good job with the pacing; even though at times nothing really happens, Castle is able to keep the movie mostly interesting up until the suspense kicks in. I Saw What You Did does have a campy feel through out the movie and I'm not sure how much was intentional; the performances were a bit weak, but the three girls were very early in their career. So with the acting it does add a camp feel. The score was idiotic and felt more like something better suited for a comedy and that also adds the campy feel to the movie.Castle though manages to deliver some decent suspense and the final act is actually pretty good. The setting is at an isolated farm house and Castle takes advantage of his settings and is able to craft some solid scenes, but the campy acting and silly music does slightly take away from the suspense. The final act almost has a slasher like feel in how its done and I'm sure some filmmakers of the 80s slasher film probably got an idea or two from this. William Castle was an entertaining, but far from masterful director, but movies like I Saw What You Did as well as Straight-Jacket show Castle was a filmmaker with some talent and far more than just a gimmick director.The performances were ok, but a bit wooden. Andi Garrett and Sarah Lane were good in their roles, but this I believe was their feature film debut so it wasn't perfect, but they do feel real and act like teenagers; Sharyl Locke as Tess was cute, but slightly annoying. John Ireland as Steve was good, but he never has that real creepy feel needed to elevate the movie; Joan Crawford appears in a small role that doesn't really add anything to the movie besides Steve being able to locate the girls.Overall I Saw What You Did was an entertaining movie that has built up a nice cult following; this was one of Castle's better flicks, but it's far from a classic. Like I said this was an entertaining movie and does make for a fun time. I Saw What You Did would have a TV remake in 1988, which starred a young Shawnee Smith (Saw) and was directed by Fred Walton director of When a Stranger Calls and April Fools Day.I wonder if this movie was of any influence on Wes Craven; in one scene Tess makes a prank phone call and says she's trying to reach her mother who is supposed to pick her up and she says the theater is on Elm Street, when Tess ends up giving the woman her house number, she calls and Libby answers and pretends to be the mother and refers to Tess as Nancy; I'd say this has to be more than a coincidence.",4,"Not

508770,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00000K0DN,David Von Pein,"[4, 4]","William Castle (the movie ""gimmick-meister"") brought to the screen in July of 1965 a film entitled ""I Saw What You Did"", starring an aging Joan Crawford (who was 60).  This was one of Joan's last pictures, and she proves here she still had what it takes (albeit, in this film, in a somewhat humorous and over-the-top fashion).The premise of this movie is a clever one -- two teenaged girls begin playing a telephone game, where they call people at random out of the phone book and inform them ""I saw what you did ... and I know who you are!""This game takes a realistic twist when (as fate would have it) one of the ""victims"" of the girls' prank turns out to have committed a murder just minutes before the call.  A dangerous game indeed.The two young girls are played by Andi Garrett and Sarah Lane.  They aren't exactly in Miss Crawford's class, acting-wise, but I liked both of them in this movie very much.  They just seemed to have a ""real"" quality to them that came through on screen.  Interestingly, this was Andi Garrett's only film appearance ever. And Sarah Lane appeared in just three other films besides this one.Anchor Bay and Universal give us this black-and-white film on DVD in a good-looking Widescreen presentation (1.78:1), with a robust-enough Mono soundtrack.  The transfer here is not ""Anamorphic"", but it looks like one nonetheless, displaying a very clear picture with little in the way of any video distractions.Not many, but a few, Bonus Features occupy space on this one-disc DVD edition. There's the Original Trailer for the film, plus a ""Teaser Trailer"", which features Director William Castle's ""World Premiere Announcement"" for this little chiller/thriller.Also on the disc are some text-only ""Talent Bios"" (for Crawford and Castle).  The Bio section for Miss Crawford is very nice, too -- featuring a multitude of text screens covering her vast career. Many vintage photos of the actress are also included on the bio text screens.A one-page (two-sided) insert comes in this Keepcased package.  This is one of the nicer single-page DVD enclosures, being made from a thicker cardboard than most flimsier paper inserts. A listing of the movie's 20 ""Chapters"" is on one side; while a reproduction of an original lobby card (or poster) for the film is shown on the other side of the insert.""I Saw What You Did"" certainly isn't the best or scariest flick you'll ever see.

That is however, virtually the only effective moment in the whole film.It founders on several things. Joan Crawford as a nosy neighbor with romantic designs on the killer could not be more absurdly coiffed and bejeweled. She chews every piece of scenery in sight !  Her every appearance is literally laughable. The two young teen aged actresses whose prank phone calls precipitate the plot are just awful, and the little girl who is being babysat is truly annoying and not at all talented.John Ireland is not half bad as the killer.The very worst of it is the musical score.

Yes, we get it, the movie's about misbehaving teenagers. You don't need to bust out the American Bandstand music every time they appear on screen.That may seem like a minor quibble, but I found the inappropriate music did have an effect on the suspense, which got dialed up pretty high in certain scenes. Just when I thought things were coming to a close, there was another little twist, and danger reared its ugly head once again. The happy ending was kind of predictable, but the path to get there was often full of surprises.I watched the movie first and foremost as a Joan Crawford fan, although I understood going into it that she had a small part and overacted it, at that.

Be careful how you dial, girls, because macho psychopath John Ireland has just brutally murdered his young wife (while he was taking a shower, no less - ""Psycho"" parallels, anyone?), and thinks you saw him do the dastardly deed. And, in good old psycho killer fashion, he will do anything to silence any alleged witnesses.Although it's unmistakably el cheapo camp, Castle's gimmicky trademark, it's a nail-biting ride, and when it comes down to it, just a fun scarefest!

They especially enjoy crooning ""I saw what you did and I know who you are"" to their victims. Unfortunately, one of their calls hits the bullseye--a homicidal maniac who has just murdered his wife.

508783,A1MWZCZGTE79DT,B00000K0DN,Rod Labbe,"[3, 6]","I've never been a big fan of William Castle, even as a Baby Boomer kid.  The first Castle directed film I saw was ""Macabre,"" which didn't do a thing for me. Then came ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""The Tingler."" I could tolerate those, because they starred my favorite horror icon, Vincent Price. HOUSE, especially, is a great Price showcase, and I love it to this day. In the 60's, Castle became quite enamored with Hitchcock's PSYCHO and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" which led to ""Straight Jacket"" (combining the talents of Psycho scribe Robert Bloch and Jane vet Joan Crawford). Crawford followed up with still another Castle endeavor, I SAW WHAT YOU DID. Hmmm...how do I say this delicately? Ok, the honest approach is always best.  I SAW WHAT YOU DID is awful! First of all, it was filmed in or around 1965 and looks like an extended episode of ""Leave it to Beaver."" The two teenage leads are completely and utterly unbelievable--they make Frankie and Annette look like Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh! So sticky sweet and ""cute,"" in that bouncy, teenage sitcom way (just like all the kids on Beaver and the Donna Reed Show). And the soundtrack! (shudder!) Take a pop record, circa 1965, remove the vocals, and that's what they used. I can't describe it in words, except to say the theme song to ""The Patty Duke Show"" would've fit in perfectly! Ok, now for the plot: teenage ditzes Libby and her girlfriend decide to have a wild night by pranking people on the telephone. Woooo! Outrageous!  How can they be so daring? They call names randomly from the phone book, saying ""I saw what you did, and I know who you are."" Hilarious, right? Well, these two bubbleheads happen to connect with a man who's just butchered his wife. Guess the rest--go on, you can do it! Joan Crawford has a totally thankless role as a busybody neighbor of the killer (Joan Ireland, looking dour). She's had the hots for him for years, it seems, and is always either looking out her window at him, looking through his window at him, or knocking on his door. The most hilarious scene in I SAW WHAT YOU DID is when Libby shows up at Ireland's house (don't ask how or why--it's beyond logic) and encounters an angry Joan, who's skulking in the shrubbery. Joan grabs the girl's hair and shrieks ""Gedoudda here!"" Not only once, but three times! And while she's doing this, her own hairpiece is coming undone!  And what the heck was that thing around Joan's neck? The most god-awful necklace--it must've weighed a ton!  I wish I could say I SAW WHAT YOU DID was suspenseful. Alas, all it did was make me wonder why I purchased this DVD!  Oh, yeah, quality-wise, the DVD is great. There are some nice extras, too...but the film is painful to watch.

508787,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B00000K0DN,Simon Davis,"[5, 5]","Producer/Director William Castle will always be remembered as a ""B"" level showman renowned for getting his best thrills in his movies through cheap tricks like wiring theatre seats with light electricity or dangling skeletons over audiences during the screenings in a feeble attempt to increase the ""thrill factor"". However I believe he has often been unfairly dismissed in his movie output and could on occasion produce interestingly original work in his movies. His highly effective ""The Night Walker"" starring Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor from 1965 comes to mind as fitting this category. 1965 also found him working off another interesting premise to create an entertaining and well acted little thriller in ""I Saw What You Did"". Admittedly the film is no masterpiece however it does succeed in its 80 or so minutes running time to create quite suspensful viewing. The idea of a prank phone call going terribly wrong and leading to a potentially deadly situation might not seem very original however here it is handled in a manner that allows the tension to slowly build and then mushrooms into a fast moving and tense climax. Castle was aided greatly here by a terrific cast headed by top billed veteran actress Joan Crawford who actually has a smaller role than the billing would suggest. Reteamed here with her old ""Queen Bee"" costar John Ireland this thriller would sadly prove to be Joan's last American film with her last two efforts being made in England. She however more than makes up for her limited screen time by totally dominating the action in her scenes making her role seem larger than it actually is. The cast includes an interesting mixture of veterans and complete new comers and they work extremely well together on what was obviously a small budget and limited production schedule. These limitations however work in the stories favour keeping the story moving at a satisfying pace with not alot of character development going on. Even the black and white photography, obviously chosen for budgetry reasons, proves highly effective here in creating just the right mood where so much of the story takes place on an eerie fog shroud night in an isolated country area.",4,Vintage William Castle Thriller Combining An Interesting Premise With A  Solid Cast Including Joan Crawford,1174348800,"03 20, 2007",2007,2195,"['Producer/Director', 'William', 'Castle', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'remembered', 'B', 'level', 'showman', 'renowned', 'getting', 'best', 'thrills', 'movies', 'cheap', 'tricks', 'wiring', 'theatre', 'seats', 'light', 'electricity', 'dangling', 'skeletons', 'audiences', 'screenings', 'feeble', 'attempt', 'increase', 'thrill', 'factor', 'However', 'believe', 'often', 'been', 'unfairly', 'dismissed', 'movie', 'output', 'could', 'occasion', 'produce', 'interestingly', 'original', 'work', 'movies', 'highly', 'effective', 'Night', 'Walker', 'starring', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'Robert', 'Taylor', '1965', 'mind', 'fitting', 'category', '1965', 'also', 'found', 'working', 'off', 'interesting', 'premise', 'create', 'entertaining', 'well', 'acted', 'little', 'thriller', 'Saw', 'What', 'Did', 'Admittedly', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'however', 'succeed', '80', 'so', 'minutes', 'running', 'time', 'create', 'quite', 'suspensful', 'viewing', 'idea', 'prank', 'phone', 'call', 'going', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'leading', 'potentially', 'deadly', 'situation', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'very', 'original', 'however', 'here', 'handled', 'manner', 'tension', 'slowly', 'build', 'then', 'mushrooms', 'fast', 'moving', 'tense', 'climax', 'Castle', 'was', 'aided', 'greatly', 'here', 'terrific', 'cast', 'headed', 'top', 'billed', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'who', 'actually', 'smaller', 'role', 'billing', 'would', 'suggest', 'Reteamed', 'here', 'old', 'Queen', 'Bee', 'costar', 'John', 'Ireland', 'thriller', 'would', 'sadly', 'prove', 'be', 'Joan', 'last', 'American', 'film', 'last', 'two', 'efforts', 'being', 'made', 'England', 'however', 'more', 'up', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'totally', 'dominating', 'action', 'scenes', 'making', 'role', 'seem', 'larger', 'actually', 'cast', 'interesting', 'mixture', 'veterans', 'complete', 'new', 'comers', 'work', 'extremely', 'well', 'together', 'what', 'was', 'obviously', 'small', 'budget', 'limited', 'production', 'schedule', 'limitations', 'however', 'work', 'stories', 'favour', 'keeping', 'story', 'moving', 'satisfying', 'pace', 'not', 'alot', 'character', 'development', 'going', 'Even', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'obviously', 'chosen', 'budgetry', 'reasons', 'highly', 'effective', 'here', 'creating', 'just', 'right', 'mood', 'where', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'place', 'eerie', 'fog', 'shroud', 'night', 'isolated', 'country', 'area']",N/A

Ratcliffe ""wearevinyl""","[2, 3]","Having seen most of William Castle's films, the only few problems i had with &quot;I Saw What You Did&quot; mainly go to a few technicals. By 1965, you would think that Castle would have filmed this in color. That was one problem. Another, the soundtrack. I can understand that the beginning of some horror films can be rather up-beat with the premise of setting the audience up for a twist that ultimately takes us for a ride. The soundtrack for this film doesn't let up, and actually sounds like music for a &quot;Beach Party&quot; film. With that aside, everyone knows that Castle did his best with what he knew. The acting is at times corny, but it was intended that way for the sake of getting the best reaction from the audience when some scenes were 'off the cuff'. The shower scene at the beginning is where i have the most praise. Castle's ability to give us a small bloodbath (remember &quot;Homicidal&quot;?) MADE me buy the dvd for that one scene. Other than that, Joan Crawford's role was good, and Castle's re-use of some of the actor's from his previous films was ok. The extra's were a nice bonus, tho a doccumentary with some of the actor's would have been interesting to watch.",5,Castle (kinda) Does It Again!,1062201600,"08 30, 2003",2003,1195,"['Having', 'seen', 'most', 'William', 'Castle', 'films', 'only', 'few', 'problems', 'i', 'had', 'quot', 'Saw', 'What', 'Did', 'quot', 'mainly', 'go', 'few', 'technicals', '1965', 'would', 'think', 'Castle', 'would', 'have', 'filmed', 'color', 'was', 'one', 'problem', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'understand', 'beginning', 'horror', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'up-beat', 'premise', 'setting', 'audience', 'up', 'twist', 'ultimately', 'ride', 'soundtrack', 'film', ""n't"", 'let', 'up', 'actually', 'like', 'music', 'quot', 'Beach', 'Party', 'quot', 'film', 'aside', 'everyone', 'Castle', 'did', 'best', 'what', 'knew', 'acting', 'times', 'corny', 'was', 'intended', 'way', 'sake', 'getting', 'best', 'reaction', 'audience', 'when', 'scenes', 'were', 'cuff', 'shower', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'i', 'have', 'most', 'praise', 'Castle', 'ability', 'give', 'small', 'bloodbath', 'remember', 'quot', 'Homicidal', 'quot', 'MADE', 'buy', 'dvd', 'one', 'scene', 'Other', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'role', 'was', 'good', 'Castle', 're-use', 'actor', 'previous', 'films', 'was', 'ok', 'extra', 'were', 'nice', 'bonus', 'tho', 'doccumentary', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'watch']",N/A
