569935,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000056N89,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[3, 3]","This Hallmark film, apparently made for Showtime, is based on the true sacrifice of high school junior Daniel Huffman (Elden Henson) who donated a kidney to save the life of his beloved grandmother Shirlee Allison (Debbie Reynolds), even though it meant giving up his boyhood dream--now within reach--of playing on a winning high school football team.This is a sappy movie, to be sure, such as one would expect from Hallmark. But it is also educational, and inspirational. My high school student especially loved it, maybe because it was a gift from his beloved grandmother, who fortunately does not need a kidney.",5,"Sappy, but very sweet",1177804800,"04 29, 2007",2007,614,"['Hallmark', 'film', 'apparently', 'made', 'Showtime', 'based', 'true', 'sacrifice', 'high', 'school', 'junior', 'Daniel', 'Huffman', 'Elden', 'Henson', 'who', 'donated', 'kidney', 'save', 'life', 'beloved', 'grandmother', 'Shirlee', 'Allison', 'Debbie', 'Reynolds', 'even', 'meant', 'giving', 'up', 'boyhood', 'dream', 'now', 'reach', 'playing', 'winning', 'high', 'school', 'football', 'team.This', 'sappy', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'such', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'Hallmark', 'also', 'educational', 'inspirational', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'especially', 'loved', 'maybe', 'was', 'gift', 'beloved', 'grandmother', 'who', 'fortunately', 'not', 'need', 'kidney']",N/A

569938,A1UNSAGRQCN5CD,B000056N89,Frankie,"[1, 1]",This is one of those stories you don't see very often. A true story of a grandson's love for his grandmother.  A story of a young man who wanted to play football all his life made the decision to give one of his kidneys to his grandmother to save her life knowing he would never be able to play football again . Debbie Reynolds is excellent as the grandmother.  The best part of this movie is the ending. I have watched it over and over again.

Decided I wanted a good copy on DVD so ordered it on Amazon. It's nice to have a good copy of this lovely little film. It's just one of those ""based on a true story"" movies that you can really enjoy. Good acting. None of that cheap labor, stilted performance stuff like you find in a lot of ""family"" movies. This was very well done.
