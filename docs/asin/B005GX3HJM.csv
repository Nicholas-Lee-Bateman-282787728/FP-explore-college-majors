And now, after watching this film I am thinking I will return the new, unopened carton of milk I just bought.These filmmakers made an educational and fun, entertaining documentary about the health dangers of milk and, while making this movie picturesque, like a well done travelogue of the U.S., they also crammed it with alarming facts about the risks of drinking milk, chiefly the way hormones in milk can cause cancer.How do you go about educating the American public on the dangers of milk, while making an interesting movie they want to watch?  It took a lot of skill and ingenuity and this was beautifully accomplished.  There was not one boring moment.  This was a cross country documentary showing some interesting towns and cities such as Roswell New Mexico, Shreveport, Raleigh, Memphis, all the while interviewing locals as they went along about what they thought or knew about milk.Nutritionists and scientists with impeccable credentials were interviewed.  They emphasized, again and again, the negative health consequences of milk drinking, such as heart disease and cancer.  Milk has, by its nature, growth hormones to help calves grow into cows.  In humans, drinking these hormones can trigger cancer to grow.  It sound so obvious now that I don't know why I never thought of it before.The milk industry spends millions on promoting milk.  Milk advertising is everywhere.  The facts about the milk industry this documentary presents are alarming.  The health risks, including asthma and auto immune diseases are described.  Anyone who has health concerns and is a milk drinker needs to see this film so they can make an informed choice about drinking cow's milk, armed with the facts.This is the most eye opening film I've ever watched and its one that everyone who drinks milk needs to watch.

Chambers,"[2, 2]","Like many kids, I went through a phase when I hated milk and only drank it because my mom wouldn't let me leave the table without emptying the glass. I got over that, of course, and came to love milk. Now almost 70 years old, I drink a gallon of skim milk a week, and if we're on vacation and I go even a day without a glass of milk, I get a powerful craving for it.The film is - at the very least - interesting, even entertaining. It challenges all of the truisms about milk that I've learned in the course of my life. Milk is one of the healthiest foods we consume, isn't it? Strong bones and good teeth, too. Well, perhaps not, if you can believe the doctors, scientists, and researchers the filmmakers interviewed. There were two allegations concerning milk: 1) Milk itself is not healthy for humans after being weaned; and 2) The hormones and antibiotics that find their way into milk aren't good for us either.The film covers a cross-country journey by the filmmakers from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, in order to get some answers from the USDA. Some of the people interviewed along the way were a hoot. (And I'll bet you didn't know that a cow may have been abducted from Roswell, New Mexico.) That was the funny part. What wasn't so funny were the other interviewees who talked about the negatives of consuming milk and related products like butter  (I really hated to hear that) and ice cream. At the end of their long trek across the US, the film crew tried unsuccessfully to interview USDA officials. They had more luck with a spokeswoman with the dairy industry, who had no idea what hit her after the interviewer made mincemeat of her. Needless to say, the dairy industry did not look good, nor did our government for pushing dairy products for the past century without questioning growing evidence that milk may not be as healthy as was formerly believed.Was the film compelling enough to persuade me to give up milk? Maybe, maybe not, but the film definitely made me at least consider it. Seriously consider it, I should add.A DVD of the film was provided by the seller in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.------------------------------------------------NOTE: A few hours after seeing the film, I did make a decision to give up my milk habit. I've just finished 24 hours of no milk. It's tough, but I'm going to try to stick it out. The film convinced me it's worth it.Update: February 26, 2014 - The film really had a lasting impression on me.

Green,"[16, 18]","I agree with almost every substantive claim made by this documentary and bought it to play for a friend who drinks too much milk (and was undermining her immune system by the vast amount of antibiotics non-organic milk contains).  The kudos on the DVD cover make one hope for a clear coherent presentation of arguments and facts marshaled effectively against dairy products. Alas, a camera in hand and a good heart do not a movie or a movie-maker make.  The DVD is a crude piece of agitprop: dull, repetitious, mindless, and disorganized. Watching it is like hearing someone shout out what you are supposed to believe -- and just because they said so.  The few solid points were presented so quickly that there was barely time to hear them, and not enough time to think about them, let alone understand them, before the well intentioned director had distracted herself and her viewers with a zig to another sound bite, a zag to a sight-gag, or a repeat of an agitprop conclusion from a few minutes before.  Much as I wanted to inform and persuade my friend, we couldn't watch more than an hour of it and I returned the product - something that I rarely ever do.If you want to learn about the harm caused by dairy products, the collusion of industry with the USDA, and the mass-marketing of lies to trick Americans into damaging their health for the sake of corporate profits, surf the web for serious articles.
