391448,A2CRUETJKX1WA5,6303952984,absent_minded_prof,"[3, 5]","In &quot;The Brothers McMullen,&quot; the three grown (Irish-American) sons of an alcoholic, hilariously stupid, complete bozo of a father reunite and Do The Bonding Thing.  All three have female-related issues and problems to rival those of, for example, the president of the United States from 1993 to 2001 -- what was his name again?  AAANY-who, they are all forced to live under one roof for a few weeks, and must come to terms with all kinds of things.  This movie is not &quot;Terms of Endearment,&quot; however.  It is funny, irreverent, and light-hearted without being fluff.The generation portrayed in this film is, in a lot of ways, the first generation of Irish Americans in their particular family to be coming to terms with the manifold social issues pertaining to the great American melting pot.  One brother is having huge problems with the stringent demands of the Irish brand of Catholicism, which are uproariously exacerbated by his relationship with a nice young Jewish American Princess, who wants him to move into her house with her extended family, and go to work for her daddy in the garment district.  The second brother seems to be unable to understand how nice it can be, and how worth fighting for, to have a college-educated, intelligent woman (a standout, very cool performance by Connie Britton [probably my favorite performance in the movie]) as a wife.  The third brother (Edward Burns) is sort of the stereotypical Irish ne'er do well writer, who drinks too much, and fears commitment like the Black Death, but who has inexplicably attracted the unwavering love of the flabbergastingly bodacious Maxine Bahns...  Anyway, I myself had an interesting viewpoint on this movie.  Want to hear it?  Well too bad, I'm going to tell you anyway.  Watching this movie, I felt like what might have been a child of Mike McGlone's character and his non-Irish girlfriend from the first part of the movie.  I saw this with my Irish American father and a couple of his brothers...  It's sort of sad in some ways -- they expect me and my siblings to have a visceral understanding of many of the jokes about Catholicism, Irish drinking, etc.  As the first generation in my family to be a good old American mutt, of mixed ethnicity, and having grown up in your standard white bread suburb, (okay, a Boston suburb, so mostly Irish, but still..) there were many things in this movie I couldn't have a personal reaction to.  The movie speaks to the sociological issues of a family at a particular stage in the acculturation process in becoming Americans -- and a very early stage at that.  I don't mean to make too huge a deal out of this, but the fact is that the Mike McGlone character -- by leaps and bounds the most conscientious brother -- is facing some very real problems in this movie, in terms of possibly giving up Catholicism, etc.  Not that becoming neurotic and freaking out about them is such a hot response, but at least he is aware of them.But moving on -- this is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by a bunch of guys with their buddies, over a case of Guiness, yet can equally be appreciated by women.  No one would call this a chick flick, but women can enjoy it.  As a matter of fact, because there are no explosions or car cases, or, on the other hand, no weepy emotional scenes, this movie can actually be enjoyed in mixed company, sort of like &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; or &quot;Beautiful Girls.&quot;  Anyway, I enjoyed this a lot, and I recommend it to anyone.

391450,A3DIVTJC2HVNJF,6303952984,DAVID SIMONS,"[9, 28]","So we were waiting on line at the Embarcadero in 1995 and I had reasonably high hopes - the movie seemed to have good 'buzz' as an unassuming slice-of-life comedy, marking a nice change of pace from the usual cinema offerings: Neither a big-budget assault on the senses nor a pretentious subtitled art film. Irish myself, I was intrigued by the movie's Celtic focus as well. All in all, it looked promising... and then the lights dimmed and the film started.Man, what a disappointment.To paraphrase Madame Bovary, I *wanted* to love this movie, but it simply gave me no reason to do so. Ostensibly a comedy, it offered no opportunity for laughs. (Can you remember a single punch line from the film? an arresting comic image? an improbable situation laden with wackiness? Me neither.) Ostensibly a romantic comedy, it offered no romance. (Of the three couples, one is dull, one is dim-witted, and one is downright depressing.) Ostensibly character-driven, it didn't have characters. (The roles range from simple-minded sketches to straight-out stereotypes, including a character &quot;from the garment district&quot; whose presence in a Spike Lee film would have drawn immediate protests from the ADL.) Ostensibly a film, it offered no plot. (What was the dramatic conflict we were watching unfold again?)And the acting! Trent Lott would be the lively one in this cast of cadavers. I realize that Burns had budget limitations, but come on - you've got to do better than just having 'that guy from the auto shop' playing Brother #3, and you need to do more than just put a coat on a guy and say he's going to play a literary agent. Hey, my mom's not doing anything this weekend, maybe she can be the female lead!Again, I realize the film had a low budget, but other directors have done much more with much less - c.f. American Movie's Mark Borchardt - and it doesn't cost *anything* to write a decent script.Ed Burns has often said he wants to be the Irish equivalent of Woody Allen. Well, his films are missing just a few minor elements - wit, dialogue, characters, plotlines, cinematography, originality, depth, and a beginning, middle and end. Once he takes care of those, he'll be fine.",1,Erin Go Yawn,971913600,"10 19, 2000",2000,2188,"['were', 'waiting', 'line', 'Embarcadero', '1995', 'had', 'reasonably', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'seemed', 'have', 'good', ""'buzz"", 'unassuming', 'slice-of-life', 'comedy', 'marking', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'usual', 'cinema', 'offerings', 'big-budget', 'assault', 'senses', 'pretentious', 'subtitled', 'art', 'film', 'Irish', 'was', 'intrigued', 'movie', 'Celtic', 'focus', 'as', 'well', 'looked', 'promising', 'then', 'lights', 'dimmed', 'film', 'started.Man', 'what', 'disappointment.To', 'paraphrase', 'Madame', 'Bovary', '*wanted*', 'love', 'movie', 'simply', 'gave', 'reason', 'do', 'so', 'comedy', 'offered', 'opportunity', 'laughs', 'Can', 'remember', 'single', 'punch', 'line', 'film', 'arresting', 'comic', 'image', 'improbable', 'situation', 'laden', 'wackiness', 'Me', 'Ostensibly', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'offered', 'romance', 'three', 'couples', 'one', 'dull', 'one', 'dim-witted', 'one', 'downright', 'depressing', 'Ostensibly', 'character-driven', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'characters', 'roles', 'range', 'simple-minded', 'sketches', 'straight-out', 'stereotypes', 'including', 'character', 'quot', 'garment', 'district', 'quot', 'presence', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'drawn', 'immediate', 'protests', 'ADL', 'Ostensibly', 'film', 'offered', 'plot', 'What', 'was', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'were', 'watching', 'unfold', 'again', 'acting', 'Trent', 'Lott', 'would', 'be', 'lively', 'one', 'cast', 'cadavers', 'realize', 'Burns', 'had', 'budget', 'limitations', 'come', ""'ve"", 'got', 'do', 'better', 'just', 'having', ""'that"", 'guy', 'auto', 'shop', 'playing', 'Brother', '3', 'need', 'do', 'more', 'just', 'put', 'coat', 'guy', 'say', 'going', 'play', 'literary', 'agent', 'Hey', 'mom', 'not', 'doing', 'anything', 'weekend', 'maybe', 'can', 'be', 'female', 'lead', 'Again', 'realize', 'film', 'had', 'low', 'budget', 'other', 'directors', 'have', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'much', 'less', 'c.f', 'American', 'Movie', 'Mark', 'Borchardt', ""n't"", 'cost', '*anything*', 'write', 'decent', 'script.Ed', 'Burns', 'often', 'said', 'be', 'Irish', 'equivalent', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Well', 'films', 'are', 'missing', 'just', 'few', 'minor', 'elements', 'wit', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'plotlines', 'cinematography', 'originality', 'depth', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'care', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine']",Brothers Mcmullen VHS

He has no sense of composition.  Burns is a poor man's Kevin Smith, in that Smith has no sense of composition either, but Smith's dialogue is much more livelier than Burns's ever will be  (I'm not a huge Smith fan, either).

He's somewhat sensitive and a little thoughtful for crying out loud!  And he doesn't drink enough beer for a coach.

Later on, he then picks up an old friendship with the Irish-American girl that grew up next door.  She repairs cars in the backyard, drinks beer like the guys and has big hair to remind you she's a girl.  I liked her better anyway.The youngest brother is the most likable.  He hasn't been a practicing Catholic since junior high; yet, he considers himself a believer.  His charismatic crudeness and way of treating woman remind me of the characters Sean Penn plays, but this guy's got better personality and looks.  Both older brothers tell him he drinks too much, but I'd say he drinks just the right amount for his age and station in life!  He doesn't seem sexually repressed to me, but his slightly overplayed male bluster and beer drinking might suggest to a shrink that he's keeping his true feelings on ice.At first glance I thought the McMullen family didn't typify mine--the brothers seem like libertines by comparison!  But they call movies and plays drama because they're supposed to dramatize.  I think the characters act out things that all of us have thought, felt, wished we'd done, experienced or observed, either consciously or unconsciously.  The incongruity of values and lifestyle between the conventional straight-laced oldest brother and the carousing youngest brother was interesting.  Unlike most men and unlike most Irish-Catholics, the brothers talk about all their conflicts with each other and their wives and girl friends (Otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie!).There's some funny, typically Catholic hypocrisy.  Middle brother is sleeping with his Jewish girlfriend.  When they go looking for an apartment together, he decides they can't live together before marriage because he's Catholic.  In another scene, they are in bed together having hank-panky and he tells her they shouldn't be using contraceptives because he's Catholic.  Oops.  I didn't use the word sex or intercourse.  Does that make me sexually repressed?Apparently, if a woman pursues a man and he's attracted to her, but he chooses to remain faithful to his wife, Hollywood considers that sexually repressed.  And if a person is torn between what they've been taught is right and what their passions command, that is considered sexually repressed.  I'd call it being a normal human being.  I don't think the movie makers were trying to portray the youngest brother as liberated; rather, I think they were trying to portray him as another kind of emotional cripple, but I'm on shaky ground here.I thought the brothers did O.K. in their relationships to others, but I was a little disappointed that none of the brothers lacked the intellectual depth and sophistication to sort out and resolve their inner conflicts.  This is the real tragedy.Unfortunately, the movie barely touches on the woman's point of view.  It would make a great sequel.",3,"If You Grew Up Irish-Catholic, You Will Be Intrigued",1026604800,"07 14, 2002",2002,3867,"['Brothers', 'McMullen', 'supposed', 'be', 'what', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'Irish-Catholic', 'America', 'context', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'being', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'everyone', 'should', 'see.The', 'movie', 'relationship', 'three', 'brothers', 'women', 'lives', 'other', 'must', 'warn', 'serious', 'romantic', 'comedy-there', 'severed', 'limbs', 'exploding', 'buildings', 'sensational', 'car', 'wrecks', 'quiet', 'movie', 'action', 'also', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'still', 'be', 'equally', 'engrossed.The', 'oldest', 'brother', 'high', 'school', 'basketball', 'coach', 'oddly', 'very', 'non-jock', 'somewhat', 'sensitive', 'little', 'thoughtful', 'crying', 'out', 'loud', ""n't"", 'drink', 'enough', 'beer', 'coach', 'friends', 'woman', 'who', 'serious', 'hots', 'turning', 'down', 'respect', 'marriage.Middle', 'brother', 'was', 'engaged', 'Jewish', 'girl', 'broke', 'up', 'due', 'own', 'moral', 'emotional', 'conflicts', 'Later', 'then', 'up', 'old', 'friendship', 'Irish-American', 'girl', 'grew', 'up', 'next', 'door', 'cars', 'backyard', 'drinks', 'beer', 'guys', 'big', 'hair', 'remind', 'girl', 'liked', 'better', 'anyway.The', 'youngest', 'brother', 'most', 'likable', ""n't"", 'been', 'practicing', 'Catholic', 'junior', 'high', 'yet', 'believer', 'charismatic', 'crudeness', 'way', 'treating', 'woman', 'remind', 'characters', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'guy', 'got', 'better', 'personality', 'older', 'brothers', 'tell', 'too', 'much', ""'d"", 'say', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'age', 'station', 'life', ""n't"", 'seem', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'slightly', 'overplayed', 'male', 'bluster', 'beer', 'drinking', 'might', 'suggest', 'shrink', 'keeping', 'true', 'feelings', 'ice.At', 'first', 'glance', 'thought', 'McMullen', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'typify', 'mine', 'brothers', 'seem', 'libertines', 'comparison', 'call', 'movies', 'plays', 'drama', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'dramatize', 'think', 'characters', 'act', 'out', 'things', 'have', 'thought', 'felt', 'wished', ""'d"", 'done', 'experienced', 'observed', 'consciously', 'unconsciously', 'incongruity', 'values', 'lifestyle', 'conventional', 'straight-laced', 'oldest', 'brother', 'carousing', 'youngest', 'brother', 'was', 'interesting', 'most', 'men', 'most', 'Irish-Catholics', 'brothers', 'talk', 'conflicts', 'other', 'wives', 'girl', 'friends', 'Otherwise', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'movie', 'funny', 'typically', 'Catholic', 'hypocrisy', 'Middle', 'brother', 'sleeping', 'Jewish', 'girlfriend', 'When', 'go', 'looking', 'apartment', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'live', 'together', 'before', 'marriage', 'Catholic', 'scene', 'are', 'bed', 'together', 'having', 'hank-panky', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'using', 'contraceptives', 'Catholic', 'Oops', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'word', 'sex', 'intercourse', 'make', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'Apparently', 'woman', 'man', 'attracted', 'remain', 'faithful', 'wife', 'Hollywood', 'considers', 'sexually', 'repressed', 'person', 'torn', 'what', ""'ve"", 'been', 'taught', 'right', 'what', 'passions', 'command', 'considered', 'sexually', 'repressed', ""'d"", 'call', 'being', 'normal', 'human', 'being', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'makers', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'youngest', 'brother', 'liberated', 'rather', 'think', 'were', 'trying', 'portray', 'kind', 'emotional', 'cripple', ""'m"", 'shaky', 'ground', 'here.I', 'thought', 'brothers', 'did', 'O.K', 'relationships', 'others', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'none', 'brothers', 'lacked', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'sophistication', 'sort', 'out', 'resolve', 'inner', 'conflicts', 'real', 'tragedy.Unfortunately', 'movie', 'barely', 'woman', 'point', 'view', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'sequel']",Brothers Mcmullen VHS
391465,A2IV22IN8A1I1K,6303952984,Steven J. Weller,"[0, 1]","The Brothers McMullen, for all the great press it got when it was released, isn't really a very good film.  It's poorly lit and shot, the script is ham-fisted and cliche'd, and the acting is painfully sub-par.  It was an indie success story but like a lot of them from the general time period, it was more about the story of the making of the film than it ever was about the story of the film itself.  Connie Britton's probably had the strongest post-Brothers career of all the cast, and she's generally been good, but she doesn't shine much brighter than the rest of Burns' players in this tale of Irish cliche's and faux lower-middle-class angst.  It's worthwhile as an historical curiosity, and the director's commentary has some real value for anyone looking to put together their own micro-budget feature, but it's not hard to see why Edward Burns has been stuck making tiny little films in relative obscurity since his sophomore effort (She's The One) more or less crashed and burned.  The Brothers McMullen doesn't fall to the level of truly bad; it's just weak and un-engaging and covers a lot of very familiar ground.",3,About What I'd Remembered...,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",2013,1126,"['Brothers', 'McMullen', 'great', 'press', 'got', 'when', 'was', 'released', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'poorly', 'lit', 'shot', 'script', 'ham-fisted', 'cliche', ""'d"", 'acting', 'painfully', 'sub-par', 'was', 'indie', 'success', 'story', 'lot', 'general', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'more', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'story', 'film', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'probably', 'had', 'strongest', 'post-Brothers', 'career', 'cast', 'generally', 'been', 'good', ""n't"", 'shine', 'much', 'brighter', 'rest', 'Burns', 'players', 'tale', 'Irish', 'cliche', 'faux', 'lower-middle-class', 'angst', 'worthwhile', 'historical', 'curiosity', 'director', 'commentary', 'real', 'value', 'anyone', 'looking', 'put', 'together', 'own', 'micro-budget', 'feature', 'not', 'hard', 'see', 'why', 'Edward', 'Burns', 'been', 'stuck', 'making', 'tiny', 'little', 'films', 'relative', 'obscurity', 'sophomore', 'effort', 'One', 'more', 'less', 'crashed', 'burned', 'Brothers', 'McMullen', ""n't"", 'fall', 'level', 'truly', 'bad', 'just', 'weak', 'un-engaging', 'lot', 'very', 'familiar', 'ground']",Brothers Mcmullen VHS
