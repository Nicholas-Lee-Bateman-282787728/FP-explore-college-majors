She is, undeniably deadpan, and it shows in practically all of her works, regardless of character. However, if you can get past the exterior, you can tell she has a heart. The movie is undeniably for those who aren't squeamish about sex, and has male characters who are actually good people, which was not what I expected at all. It's all about owning your sexuality and who you are, and is a great little coming of age flick with a pretty good message. (I don't recommend showing it to your kids, though). I laughed at the navet&eacute; of 90s high school students--I was born in the late eighties and I can still remember what it was like before Wikipedia, so it's a great nostalgia blast, especially during the beginning credits.

1611070,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00AIBZJ0C,FNDNreview,"[5, 19]","It's relatively safe to say the teen comedy is on the verge of death - at least for the moment.  With so many different films attempting to ride the coattails of America Pie, film writers have been dead set outdoing each other in the ""outlandish"" department with each new film.  While American Pie can be credited with the modern success of the ""sex comedy,"" it was classics like Porky's, Animal House, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High that set the stage for Pie's eventual success.  In the year's following its 1999 release, several similar incarnations of America Pie were released - including Superbad, Van Wilder, and The Girl Next Door.  Each of these films, and countless others like it, followed the exact same premise, making sex the most important aspect of teen adolescence.  However, due to the over abuse of the ""teen sex comedy,"" it has become an utterly predictable genre, currently lacking originality.  Recent films, such as 21 & Over, Project X, and even American Reunion, have all been commercially successful - yet failed to contribute something new or different to the genre.  Adding to the list of unoriginal teen sex comedies is the new film, The To Do List.Making her feature-length directorial debut, Maggie Carey writes and directs The To Do List, starring Aubrey Plaza as Brandy Klark.  The year is 1993 and Brady is graduating high school at the top of her class, but she has never had a sexual experience in her life.  Deciding she needs to be experienced before entering college, she makes a ""to do"" check list of sexual maneuvers that will remedy her lack of experience.  She takes a job at the local public swimming pool, which also happens to be where her ""crush,"" Rusty Waters (Scott Porter), is working for the summer.  From beginning to end, it's a summer full of hijinks as Brandy focuses on finishing her checklist while dealing with her straightforward parents, verbally abusive sister, and drunken boss.  Bill Hader, Rachel Bilson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Alia Shawkat, Sarah Steel, Johnny Simmons, Connie Britton, and Clark Gregg also star in supporting roles.Aubrey Plaza does an admirable job of leading the charge in this humorous, raunchy flick.  Her character has a stern sensibility - unwavering and direct.  And while Plaza is a like-able main character, she's not that loveable.  In comparison to other main characters in teen sex comedies, like Jonah Hill or Jason Biggs, there's really no ambition to root for Brandy Klark.  She exudes far too much confidence to create a believable story and frankly, she really doesn't face a conundrum over the course of this film - other than when or if she should attempt to ""close the deal"" with her male infatuation, Rusty Waters.  Over the course of the film, her character is too promiscuous for her own good, which doesn't exactly paint a pretty picture for the seemingly meaningless acts of her teen angst.While the Brandy Klark character and her unbelievably direct ambitions are the major hang-up of this film, the rest of the supporting characters make up for it with a great deal of absurd interactions of their own, making for plenty of unrealistic laughs - if you're into sexual humor.  Some of the scenes really press the limit of the R-rating, including a rather memorable movie theater experience, an encounter in the pool's shower room, and a frightfully embarrassing father/daughter moment during the closing minutes of the film.  Speaking of the father, Clark Gregg, whom many will recognize as Agent Coulson from Marvel's The Avengers, plays Brandy's father - a sheltered parent that is easily embarrassed by his wife and daughters.  Friday Night Lights alum Connie Britton plays his wife and Brandy's mother - the brutally honest parent that openly prepares her daughters for sex.  On the plus side, nearly each and every scene involving Clarke and Britton will provide for a substantial amount of laughter.  Rachel Bilson, who plays Brandy's sister in the film, also provides a handful of laughs with her critical, often verbally abusive language towards Brandy.The To Do List could easily change its name to ""Superbad 2"" as both Superbad and The To Do List mirror each other in plot direction, only from the opposite side of the gender spectrum.  Both films put sex on a pedestal for curious teens, with Superbad obviously focusing on the high school male perspective, while The To Do List focuses on the female aspect of sexual encounters.  And oddly enough, both films feature Bill Hader and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in supporting roles.  Mintz-Plasse, who struck stardom as the awkward teen, McLovin, is not as prominent in this film as he was in Superbad.  Hader, on the other hand, plays a similar character - which doesn't take life too seriously and often spends his time doing irresponsible things, like drinking all day and well, drinking all night, too.  Still - in the grand scheme of things, these supporting players provide somewhat important roles for both flicks.The bad news about The To Do List, which heavily outweighs anything good about the film, is the fact that it will simply remind you of countless other teen comedies, like the pre-mentioned comedies, Superbad and American Pie.  Sure, The To Do List is chalk full of embarrassing, childish moments and sex jokes that will make for a few belly laughs - but the film focuses far too much on cheap laughs and not enough on an intelligible plot.  While popular films like American Pie or Superbad set themselves apart from the rest of the films in its genre, The To Do List doesn't DO anything new.  It's simply more of the same raunchy sexual experiences that a writer dreamed up in order to achieve these uninspiring cheap laugh.  The film's plot works fine for what it is, and at certain points, it's even charming.  But, it's simply unoriginal and features a film premise that is severely outdated and over abused.  For those that love this style of humor, sure this film is worth a view - but for everyone else, this film has the power to easily offend and remains too uninteresting for any rational person to find meaning in it.GRADE: C-FNDNreview.com",2,"'The To Do List' a raunchy, Superbad-like comedy",1374969600,"07 28, 2013",2013,6141,"['relatively', 'safe', 'say', 'teen', 'comedy', 'verge', 'death',

Instead of basing the heroine's emotional growth on her falling in love with a boy - a cowardly cliche that is so contrived and dishonest to sell-out the perverted lust of the hero with some corny, redemptive romance - the heart of &#34;The To Do List&#34; is rooted in the lead's relationships with friends and family. The princess who doesn't need to marry a prince, one who can be as debased as any boy... this film is indeed a bold step forward for gender equality, and people learning about pearl necklaces.Also, Amazon says Andy Samberg is a co-star, but he is only a cameo.

1611081,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00AIBZJ0C,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[2, 2]","The summer comedy sex romp. You've seen it before, although most of the ones I remember center around male protagonists. This one follows Brandy Klark (Aubrey Plaza) as her graduating class's valedictorian, a well-studied, bookish, painfully honest and socially stunted lady who is worried about entering college with literally no sexual experiences under her belt. So to speak.Hoping to get a little practice before game time, Brandy drafts a To Do List containing every sexual experience she can think of, including more than a few that she doesn't understand at all (shockers and pearl necklaces, to name a few). With the help of some of her friends, as well as a comedic cast of goofballs (including the fantastic Bill Hader and Andy Samberg), she will stumble through raunchy, nutty, and nearly X-rated experiences as she makes her way to the mostly pre-packaged ending that films like this seem required to have.In spite of its pretty basic story and foregone conclusion, the film is funny, as long as you calibrate your sense of humor to its goals. After all, this is about as low brow as comedy gets. It's right there in the title. Even though there are more than a few stock characters, nearly every actor does their best and seems to be having fun doing it, which is infectious.Congrats to Aubrey Plaza for her first top starring role. Innately charming and classically pretty (but not so gorgeous that she's unbelievable as the inexperienced nerd), she actually carried the movie a lot better than I expected her to. However, I still didn't feel, by the film's end, that she completely sold me on her character, especially in the very few moments when the script asks her to be dramatically sincere. She's got some great (developing) comedic chops, but her ability to convey honest emotions like dismay, hopelessness, or fear still isn't up to headliner quality.These tarnished moments in the film's acting are rare, though. Definitely the kind of film you're better off watching with a group of close friends and maybe a box of wine or two, THE TO DO LIST achieves its meager goals with all the crass aplomb that you should expect.

She also wears the big ""V"" sign and wants to eliminate it before heading off to college.  So with help from her somewhat experienced two best friends, Fiona (Alia Shawkat) and Wendy (Sarah Steele) and her encyclopedia, Brandy devises a sexual to-do list.The premise isn't necessarily new, but historically it is the guys who develop the list in raunchy films like this one.  And yes, there are plenty of descriptive sexual moves that go well past the few better known ones.  In this film, unlike some of the similar themed ones of the past, the filmmakers pull their punches when it comes to actually showing anything.  All the action is below or above the camera lens or covered in heavy blankets.  Don't get me wrong, the film has its moments but this is more a titillating comedy, than a breast-fest.Brandy uses people she knows like her lab partner, Cameron (Johnny Simmons), to get through some of the easier tasks (the movie was originally named ""The Hand Job"") unaware that he has a big crush on her.  Her ultimate goal is to lose her virginity (and more) to the hunky, older life guard (Scott Porter) where she works.  When it comes to detailed tips, Brandy must rely on her older, slutty sister Amber (Rachel Bilson) for information.  This of course, usually comes at a price.Connie Britton and Clark Gregg get in a few good moments as Brandy's parents.  Andy Samberg, Donald Glover and Christopher Mintz-Plasse play characters that are little more than checkmarks on the list.  Bill Hader is pretty damn funny as well as Brandy's manager at the pool.

1611086,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00AIBZJ0C,Patrick L. Randall,"[13, 17]","Teen sex comedies are a strange beast.  If they are done just for the sake of raunchiness, they can give audiences (particularly the teen audiences) several cheap laughs, but are quickly forgotten.  A lot of films by the Farrelly Brothers, Adam Sandler, and the disasters foisted upon us by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (""Date Movie"", ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"") fall into that category.However, when the films show a greater understanding of their characters and the hormonal confusion of that age, they tend to be more memorable.  The first ""American Pie"" film fit that bill perfectly.  Now, we have ""The To-Do List"", which not only understands what it's like to be a teenager with nothing but sex on the mind, it also understands what it was like to live in 1993.The plot of ""The To-Do List"" centers on Brandy Klark (Aubrey Plaza), a very studious, accomplished and stuck-up high school valedictorian who has led a very sheltered life, partially due to her conservative father and partially due to her on choosing.  Following graduation, she works a summer job as a lifeguard at run down pool and finds herself very attracted fellow lifeguard, Rusty, a piece of man-candy with the all the 1993 cliches:  sensitive guitar playing, ripped abs, and long Seattle-style rocker hair.  Brandy realizes that her insulated upbringing has left her with virtually no sexual knowledge.  So, the highly organized Brandy sets out a `to-do list' of sexual activities she wants to engage in as part of her goal of sleeping with Rusty by summer's end.  The curiosity and embarrassment that ensue are experiences all of us remember during our own `coming-of-age'.Aubrey Plaza does a wonderful job of portraying the confused, but determined, Brandy as a curious teenager who is committed to learning about physical activities in her own rigid, regimented way.  Her supporting cast includes her best friends Fiona (Alia Shawkat) and Wendy (Sarah Steele), who talk a big game when encouraging Brandy to go for it with her list, but seem to not be as experienced as they make themselves out to be.The audience was in stitches throughout the entire movie (myself included).  Any comedy that can get create that kind of experience for its audience is worth seeing.

1611088,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00AIBZJ0C,Paul Allaer,"[7, 9]","""The To Do List"" (2013 release; 104 min.) brings the story of Brandy (played by Audrey Plaza), who has just graduated as the valedictorian of her 1993 high school class. Brandy has been the academic overachiever but is mocked for still being a virgin. Brandy's best friends Fiona and Wnedy convince her that she needs some 'experience' before she heads off to college at Georgetown. Brandy reluctantly agrees and then runs into Rusty at a party. Rusty is the ultimate good-looking all-American hunk and Brandy has the hots for him. Meanwhile Brandy has made a list of sex activities she wants to accomplish, and her lifelong friend Cameron is 'giving her a hand'. To make ends meet, Brandy has taken a summer job as a life guard at the local pool, where Rusty and Cameron also work. To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a racy movie about sex. If that sounds like it will offend you or turn you off, save yourself the trouble (and money), and check out another movie instead. But if the subject tmatter doesn't offend you, be prepared for a funny movie with lots of racy language and situations. I have to say that I found myself chuckling and laughing a lot more than I had expected, and the audience in the theatre was equally eating it up. This is the debut feature of writer-director Maggie Carey, so it's not guys who were dreaming up the script! Aubrey ""Parks and Recreation"" Plaza shines throughout as Brenda, but kudos as well to several others (and to me preciously unknown), including Alia Shawkat and Sarah Steele as Brenada's best friends, and a special mention for Scott Porter as the good-looking hunk Rusty, giving a tongue-in-cheek performance. Last but certainly not least, the movie features a stellar soundtrack from the early 90s with songs from 2 Live Crew, Naughty By Nature, Gin Blossoms, mazzy Star, the Cranberries, etc. etc. (Brendy's room has posters on the wall of Pearl Jam and also REM Green World Tour 1989, I suppose the producers couldn't get or afford the musical rights to these superstars.)Bottom line: this is a racy but funny movie that I found even endearing in a very unexpected way, as Aubrey Plaza will charm you from start to finish. ""The To Do List"" reminds me in spirit quite a bit of ""For a Good Time, Call..."" from last year: a light-hearted sex comedy from the woman's perspective. There is a fine line between racy/funny and vulgar/off-putting, and this movie stays within that boundary that you'll smile more often than not. The screening I saw this at here in Cincinnati today was quite well attended for a matinee, and laughing out loud at many occasions, so this movie may have some legs on the big screen. Assuming you are not offended by the subject matter, ""The To Do List"" is worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",4,Racy but in a funny way,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,2926,"['Do', 'List', '2013', 'release', '104', 'min', 'story', 'Brandy', 'played', 'Audrey', 'Plaza', 'who', 'just', 'graduated', 'valedictorian', '1993', 'high', 'school', 'class', 'Brandy', 'been', 'academic', 'overachiever', 'mocked', 'still', 'being', 'virgin', 'Brandy', 'best', 'friends', 'Fiona', 'Wnedy', 'convince', ""'experience"", 'college', 'Georgetown', 'Brandy', 'reluctantly', 'then', 'Rusty', 'party', 'Rusty', 'ultimate', 'good-looking', 'all-American', 'hunk', 'Brandy', 'hots', 'Meanwhile', 'Brandy', 'made', 'list', 'sex', 'activities', 'accomplish', 'lifelong', 'friend', 'Cameron', ""'giving"", 'hand', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'Brandy', 'taken', 'summer', 'job', 'life', 'guard', 'local', 'pool', 'where', 'Rusty', 'Cameron', 'also', 'work', 'tell', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'experience', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'racy', 'movie', 'sex', 'will', 'offend', 'turn', 'off', 'save', 'trouble', 'money', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'instead', 'subject', 'tmatter', ""n't"", 'offend', 'be', 'prepared', 'funny', 'movie', 'lots', 'racy', 'language', 'situations', 'have', 'say', 'found', 'chuckling', 'laughing', 'lot', 'more', 'had', 'expected', 'audience', 'theatre', 'was', 'equally', 'eating', 'up', 'debut', 'feature', 'writer-director', 'Maggie', 'Carey', 'not', 'guys', 'who', 'were', 'dreaming', 'up', 'script', 'Aubrey', 'Parks', 'Recreation', 'Plaza', 'shines', 'Brenda', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'others', 'preciously', 'unknown', 'including', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'Sarah', 'Steele', 'Brenada', 'best', 'friends', 'special', 'mention', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'good-looking', 'hunk', 'Rusty', 'giving', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'performance', 'Last', 'certainly', 'not', 'least', 'movie', 'stellar', 'soundtrack', 'early', '90s', 'songs', '2', 'Live', 'Crew', 'Naughty', 'Nature', 'Gin', 'Blossoms', 'mazzy', 'Star', 'Cranberries', 'etc', 'etc', 'Brendy', 'room', 'posters', 'wall', 'Pearl', 'Jam', 'also', 'REM', 'Green', 'World', 'Tour', '1989', 'suppose', 'producers', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'afford', 'musical', 'rights', 'superstars', 'Bottom', 'line', 'racy', 'funny', 'movie', 'found', 'even', 'endearing', 'very', 'unexpected', 'way', 'Aubrey', 'Plaza', 'will', 'charm', 'start', 'finish', 'Do', 'List', 'spirit', 'quite', 'bit', 'Good', 'Time', 'Call', 'last', 'year', 'light-hearted', 'sex', 'comedy', 'woman', 'perspective', 'fine', 'line', 'racy/funny', 'vulgar/off-putting', 'movie', 'boundary', ""'ll"", 'smile', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'screening', 'saw', 'here', 'Cincinnati', 'today', 'was', 'quite', 'well', 'attended', 'matinee', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'many', 'occasions', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'legs', 'big', 'screen', 'Assuming', 'are', 'not', 'offended', 'subject', 'matter', 'Do', 'List', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'be', 'theatre', 'DVD/Blu-ray']",N/A

However, the film does not develop much from that point and goes right into the chaos. While the sex farce gets tiring and a bit redundant (with the exception of a few interesting discussions and dialogue that could serve as a 16 year old's portal to right or mostly wrong), it is the 1990s chic and set pieces that keep the film going also with one of the most exciting (and even dirtiest) soundtracks (Pearl Jam, MC Hammer, Naughty by Nature, 2 Live Crew) to a film this year.What sets this film different to a film that opens the discussion about sexuality is that it is knowing of its subject matter in a way like Don Jon, a much better indie comedy-drama about sexual adventures and temptation. If you like Aubrey Plaza's deadpan, hipster flair in her work, you will definitely like this film but if not, do not come in expecting a whole lot other than teenage angst and lust.""",3,"Not great but still an alright, respectable debut.
