Married couples are STILL breaking up at alarming rates twenty five years later. The only difference is no one's shocked anymore...which would make Mari and Jeff Thompson's dismay a bit outdated to our modern eyes, though no less heartfelt.In our current culture that demonizes any kind of misconceived ""threat"" (gay marriage, feminism, happily single men and women, whatever victim you want to choose) to traditional marriage, it's nice to see that at one time people actually worried about fixing their own affairs rather than blaming others!!I'm a bit biased because I'm a huge Natalie Wood fan and love her later work (""The Cracker Factory,"" ""The Affair,"" even the remake of ""From Here to Eternity"") but I have to say I enjoyed this film, warts and all. It seems that almost every film made in the late 70s and early 80s featured oddly dressed characters dancing to new wave/disco (think ""Xanadu""). Don't let the occasional fashion faux pas divert your attention from the fact you could learn a lot about what makes a good marriage work!George Segal's warm-hearted, goofy charm and Natalie Wood's wise, but innocent ways create an energy that help ""The Last Married Couple in America"" get through the rough spots.",4,Not so different from today...,1156204800,"08 22, 2006",2006,1375,"['film', 'outrageous', 'clothes', 'bad', 'perms', 'just', 'scream', '1980', 'Last', 'Married', 'Couple', 'America', 'surprisingly', 'relevant', '21st', 'century', 'Married', 'couples', 'are', 'STILL', 'breaking', 'up', 'alarming', 'rates', 'twenty', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'only', 'difference', 'one', 'shocked', 'anymore', 'would', 'make', 'Mari', 'Jeff', 'Thompson', 'dismay', 'bit', 'outdated', 'modern', 'eyes', 'less', 'heartfelt.In', 'current', 'culture', 'kind', 'misconceived', 'threat', 'gay', 'marriage', 'feminism', 'happily', 'single', 'men', 'women', 'victim', 'want', 'choose', 'traditional', 'marriage', 'nice', 'see', 'one', 'time', 'people', 'actually', 'worried', 'fixing', 'own', 'affairs', 'rather', 'blaming', 'others', ""'m"", 'bit', 'biased', ""'m"", 'huge', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'fan', 'love', 'later', 'work', 'Cracker', 'Factory', 'Affair', 'even', 'remake', 'Here', 'Eternity', 'have', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'warts', 'almost', 'film', 'made', 'late', '70s', 'early', '80s', 'featured', 'oddly', 'dressed', 'characters', 'dancing', 'new', 'wave/disco', 'think', 'Xanadu', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'occasional', 'fashion', 'faux', 'pas', 'divert', 'attention', 'fact', 'could', 'learn', 'lot', 'what', 'good', 'marriage', 'work', 'George', 'Segal', 'warm-hearted', 'goofy', 'charm', 'Natalie', 'Wood', 'wise', 'innocent', 'ways', 'create', 'energy', 'Last', 'Married', 'Couple', 'America', 'get', 'rough', 'spots']",N/A

Was this the result of police strikes, women's lib, condominiums or just the trendy thing to do?  George Segal and Natalie Wood play a happy couple in a longstanding marriage.

It doesn't help that their friends are trying to split them up.  Misery loves company as the old adage goes.

Very 70s/early 80s feel good take on life and kind of revolting how obsessed the characters are with sex! But that was the 70s...UPDATE OK, I've watched this movie several times since my first review and have come to the conclusion that too much white wine was playing into my perception of the movie. Now this has become one of my all-time favorite movies. Yes, the characters are obsessed with sex but compared to how sex is treated in today's movies, this picture is practically tame. I love how George Segal and Natalie Wood are with each other. They obviously like each other and even though they aren't faithful, the fact that neither of them is perfect makes the movie that much more interesting. In a nutshell, George and Natalie are the last couple standing among their friends and the pressure to see what's ""out there"" finally makes George succumb to the aggressive overtures of Valerie Harper (who does an excellent job as a woman on the prowl). George gets the clap, Natalie kicks him out and the two of them try to have a good time as ""an act of hostility."" I loved the scene where George explained to Valerie why he slept with her. It wasn't at all flattering to her but she obviously didn't care. I also love the end of this movie where George and Natalie tell each other to stop sleeping with other people. Yes, it has a happy ending and I'm glad.

I cannot, for the life of me, see why this was bashed by the critics so badly, or why it is not more widely available. Both George Segal and Natalie Wood give great performances, the writing is clever and fun, production is top notch, and the story line was quite relevant for it's day, and still is.A married couple (Segal and Wood) look on as their friends, and almost the whole world, it seems, are on a ""divorce tangent,"" and they begin to worry that it might also invade their marriage. As they witness most of their friends' marriages fall apart and it seems like the whole world is experiencing a sexual and social revolution, they find themselves getting caught up in it as well.There are some great actors of the era in this movie(Dom DeLuise, Allan Arbus, Richard Benjamin, Priscilla Barnes, Valarie Harper, Arlene Golonka, Oliver Clark) and it does get into some discussion about social trends and the effects of society on marriage and vice versa. I can recommend this to married couples especially and anyone thinking of marriage.

Is their marriage next? The premise of suburban couple seduced by the lure of ""free love"" and wife swapping as a comedy is ripe for exploitation but it was already done superbly in BOB & CAROL & TED & ALICE (also with Wood) and this weak wannabe only shows what a good film that was. Directed by Gilbert Cates (I NEVER SANG FOR MY FATHER), the film is often in poor taste (maybe it's just me but I don't find giving your wife gonorrhea very funny) and tries to hard to be hip. Both Segal and Wood (looking terrific) work hard but it's uphill all the way. Proof positive that nothing dates faster than topicality. It's not until the film's last twenty minutes when a porn star (Dom DeLuise) throws a party at Segal's house and porn stars and suburbanites mix together that there's some genuine amusement, however mild.

It wants to portray a shallow world, but only in a smirking way. There's people who break up for inexplicable reasons, and blame 'The women's movement, the economy, condominiums', there are others who say things like 'our marriage was a fake, we were just pretending'.This movie goes to the heart of shallow thinking. One guy revels in being divorced, talking about how it makes him a 'new man' and about how he can buy 'new clothes' and reinvent himself, while there's another guy who only seems to know the women he's been married to by nationality 'I've been divorced three times, two Americans, one Irish, now I thought I'd go for an Italian'. And let's not forget the sleazy divorce lawyer who has pick-up lines and likes moving in on recently seperated women for, well, 'clients with benefits'.The biggest laugh is at the end, when there's a wild party and there's a swinger couple. But the lady has had enough of being used like a piece of meat and leaves the guy. You won't believe who he blames.The film is also an interesting look at Jeff (George Segal) ad his wife (Natalie Wood) and how being involved with all these people effects them.An interesting movie, but not taken too seriously.
