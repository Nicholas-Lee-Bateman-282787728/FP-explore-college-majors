""Daniel""","[0, 0]","British director Ken Loach's MY NAME IS JOE earned an award at the 1998 Cannes Film festival (Peter Mullan in the Best Actor category) and a few other prizes in European film festivals. AfterCarla's Song, it was the second time Ken Loach was working with script writer Paul Laverty. LikeA Fond KissorLadybird Ladybird [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.4 Import - Australia], MY NAME IS JOE belongs to the cycle of films Ken Loach dedicated to the present social situation of Great Britain.MY NAME IS JOE deals with one of Ken Loach's favorite themes: if something must change socially or politically in a given situation, it's only by means of a collective action that things will evolve. Even if Joe Kavanagh manages, for a moment, to help juvenile delinquents around him, he won't be able to eradicate by himself the London underworld. Ken Loach's cinema is terribly pessimistic but, in its small way, it could multiply its seeds and wake in the audience the desire to live in a better world.A VHS to throw into the garbage can as soon as the DVD is available.",4,IT'S A LONG WAY TO PARADISE,1180742400,"06 2, 2007",2007,1055,"['British', 'director', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'MY', 'NAME', 'IS', 'JOE', 'earned', 'award', '1998', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'festival', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'Best', 'Actor', 'category', 'few', 'other', 'prizes', 'European', 'film', 'festivals', 'AfterCarla', 'Song', 'was', 'second', 'time', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'was', 'working', 'script', 'writer', 'Paul', 'Laverty', 'LikeA', 'Fond', 'KissorLadybird', 'Ladybird', '[', 'NON-USA', 'FORMAT', 'PAL', 'Reg.4', 'Import', 'Australia', ']', 'MY', 'NAME', 'IS', 'JOE', 'cycle', 'films', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'dedicated', 'present', 'social', 'situation', 'Great', 'Britain.MY', 'NAME', 'IS', 'JOE', 'deals', 'one', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'favorite', 'themes', 'something', 'must', 'change', 'socially', 'politically', 'given', 'situation', 'only', 'means', 'collective', 'action', 'things', 'will', 'evolve', 'Even', 'Joe', 'Kavanagh', 'moment', 'help', 'juvenile', 'delinquents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'eradicate', 'London', 'underworld', 'Ken', 'Loach', 'cinema', 'terribly', 'pessimistic', 'small', 'way', 'could', 'multiply', 'seeds', 'wake', 'audience', 'desire', 'live', 'better', 'world.A', 'VHS', 'throw', 'garbage', 'can', 'as', 'soon', 'DVD', 'available']",My Name Is Joe VHS

462972,A2KG8WLR1AKO12,6305412820,"David Thomson ""Second Rate Eric Hoffer Imitator""","[5, 13]","This story clearly points out why the British Isles have economically fallen behind even Italy in gross national product. Director, Ken Loach, allows us a peek into the sad  destructive results of the socialist nanny state prevailing in the British Isles.  Joe is supposedly a sign painter who has plenty of time to coach a soccer team, but rarely  does anything to earn a living.  He knows that he will get his welfare check, and there is little reason to search for steady employment.  Joe reminds one of the comic  strip character, Andy Capp.  There is an insightful scene in the movie where Joe rages at a welfare official who has photographed him earning money under the table.  Joe is  not in the least bit apologetic for violating the rules, but instead argues that he is still entitled to his parasitical allowance!  The government owes him a living, and that's all there is to it. We meet  Joe's social worker girlfriend and soccer team buddies.  The former serves a governmental welfare agency that does its best to further a therapeutic enabling milieu.  The buddies are drug users and part time thieves.  Everyone of them is chronologically between the ages of 20 to 40, but none have any interest in  assuming adult responsibilities.Joe is placed into an awkward predicament by one of the younger soccer team members who owes money to a local mobster.  The mob leader according to the mores of the gangland social group refuses to cut the young man any slack out of fear of losing respect with his peers.  This is where the movie truly comes alive and compels the viewer to pay full attention.  The  ultimate resolution of this crisis forces Joe to reexamine the direction of his life.  The film is something of a dark comedy.  Loach, however, has the courage not to  indulge in sentimentality.  There is no happy ending, and we sense that similar troubles await most of these people in the future.  Only Joe and his girlfriend  might possess sufficient maturity to learn from the final tragic event.  I enjoyed this modest film immensely.  Thankfully, I might add, the director added subtitles  which helped me to follow the Scottish accent.  I hope to see more of Loach's work in the future.

462973,A2F89BTWLSEEKF,6305412820,Edward M. Erdelac,"[11, 11]","Cripes, but this is one bleak, beautiful movie.  Plot is a recovering Scottish alcoholic house painting soccer coach, while pursuing a budding romance with a social worker, finds himself taking on the responsibility of one of his drug-addicted soccer charges who owes money to a local gang boss.This is drama in its highest form.  This is a movie on par with the greatest moral dramas the cinema has ever produced (On The Waterfront, The Lost Weekend, etc).Okay, its bleak, but don't go into this expecting some utterly incomprehensible European mess -the characters in this are readily accessible blue collar `joes' with realistic problems, and when they are being good you get a warm feeling, and when they connect you want to cheer, and by golly, when they fail you are as shattered as if it was you or someone you know on the screen.  The characters do speak with a heavy Scot accent, but I really wish I could've turned the subtitles off  - I felt like somebody somewhere assumed I wouldn't understand it, and with the crutch of subtitles I really have no hope of attempting to (and they're a little distracting from the screen when perhaps they don't even need to be there).Peter Mullan's performance as Joe was the very best of that year - how the American Academy passed over this film is God's own wonder.

He coaches a welfare soccer team, goes to his 12-step meetings and does painting jobs on the sly in order to make ends meet. Life really takes a turn for the best when he meets social worker Sarah Downie (Louise Goodall).Their relationship is sweet and quite charming. How nice it would have been if the McGowen Boys did not rule the town and the drug trade.Joe is forced to make decisions that threaten his sobriety and his relationship with Sarah as he tries to protect his best friends from falling deeper into the world of addiction.No small wonder that Mullan took home the best actor award at Cannes in 1999 for this role. This is acting at it's most primal!Director Ken Loach always takes on the grim realities of life in his films, and MY NAME IS JOE is not for the faint at heart.Loach exposes Scotland in it's poverty, crime and underworld drug trade through the eyes of a man who is in much need of his own recovery. Loach examines the difficulties that confront those trying to heal from substance abuse in a place where temptation and thugs exist around every corner to thwart the addict's recovery.Loach has one very interesting scene where tourists are seen taking their pictures with a bagpiper who "" only knows three songs."" Joe remarks ""Ah, good ol' Bonnie Scotland!"" showing the stark contrast in which outsiders see Scotland as opposed to the problems that it really has.This film is RAW and has extremely coarse language throughout.There is alot of explosive emotion.This film, though ,is not without it's very tender side. Definitely adult content, MY NAME IS JOE is excellent for understanding the ups and downs of addiction and highlights absolutely some of the finest acting that you will ever see.
