Eisenhower ordered a comprehensive photographic documentation of the findings at each of the 'camps' within Germany and occupied territories. The narrative is far more effective for the complete lack of emotion. To try to understand what actually happened is virtually impossible. This video does include a few unusual documented incidents (contrary to one reviewer's statement). Genocide has been present throughout history but the concentration/work camps created in Nazi Germany and occupied territories were without precedent.  This is a military documentary that provides the basic information including the different nationalities of inmates . . . i.e. German, Russian, Polish, French, Belgium, and even American prisoners of war. These killing grounds were used for more than an answer to 'The Jewish Question.' Be aware that this video is graphic in the extreme and not for everyone.  Listen carefully to the narration and try to fathom the depths of depravity and human carnage found at these sites. Without a doubt there is little sensationalism and the facts speak for themselves.Try to imagine the impact on 'seasoned' troops in the US military . . . absolutely nothing had prepared them for what they found. Medical personnel were ill prepared to cope with the situation and yet they managed to do all that was possible to prevent further loss of life and the spread of infectious diseases.

This was authorized by the Supreme Commander of Armed Forces in Europe, General Eisenhower, and shows what the allies found in these camps in Germany at the end of WWII.  Although I have watched many documentaries on WWII this is by far the one that pulls no punches and is frightening in its hard hitting approach. It is a reminder of how evil can easily take control when good men fail to do anything to stop it. This movie only concentrates on the camps in Germany and there were many more than I was ever aware of.
