1412525,A1ZAIEZHFLI9UN,B004KVXCB4,Benjamin Archambault,"[126, 130]","Doc Martin, Series 1-4, is a character-focused comedy/drama like few others.  The characters are so well constructed and executed in such a short amount of time that you'll be immersed and concerned with their every activity.The primary character is, of course, Doctor Martin Ellingham. He has just moved to the hickishly small village of Portwenn from London because of a horrible revulsion at the sight of blood. This wouldn't be a terrible problem except that he was a world-class surgeon.Now he is reduced to take a lowly position in the sticks with people who seem like hillbillies to him. Each character is presented with general hilarity or heart-cord-strumming drama.And the Doc has to interact with all of this humor and drama with what can only be considered undiagnosed Asperger's Syndrome. He is cantankerous, stand-offish, arrogant and purposefully offensive to the locals. But only because he is superior in thought and deed.You'll enjoy every last minute.In Series 1-4, you'll get:Series 1:  6 episodesSeries 2:  8 episodes + 2-episode-length Christmas specialSeries 3:  7 episodesSeries 4:  8 episodes(Episodes are roughly 45 minutes)Also note that this is the not the fully complete series -- only the complete series thus far.

We wanted it to keep going on, but unfortunately it looks like there were only series 1 thru 4.Doc Martin is a wonderful and brilliant doctor as portrayed in this t.v. series. The only bad thing about the Doc is that he has no bedside manners and he is not very nice towards his patients, I guess you could say he's very mean, but he is an excellent doctor who is very devoted to his patients. He cares about his patients. Can you believe that, a doctor that actually cares about their patients.

1412535,A33FCLUEQSUD68,B004KVXCB4,Claire,"[3, 3]","Doc Martin was a sleeper hit for us. A relative recommended it so I reluctantly bought it for my father who is a physician. After we got the subtitles working so we could understand what they were saying, immense enjoyment soon followed. My father who does not watch much television outside of sports fell in love with this cute comedy/drama. Our family's favorite show in the 90's was Seinfeld and then later we got addicted to Lost but lately we have not had anything good to watch as a family. We are not into crime shows or even medical dramas. And for my dad to be able to enjoy a show it has to be somewhat &#34;clean&#34; meaning no graphic sex or profanity. This was the perfect vehicle to deliver some clean fun entertainment. The characters are charming and the writing is excellent but the real star of the show is the scenery- the quaint little seaside village used for the town is simply adorable. Right on the water with plenty of beautiful green pastures. Doc Martin himself is wickedly funny. I cannot say enough about this delightful discovery. Forget Downton Abbey... this is the British show that has left us panting for more. We marathon watched the 5 available seasons (or as the Brits call them, &#34;series&#34;) and are now eagerly awaiting the sixth season hopefully coming out soon. One unappealing character in the first season is the Doc's secretary Elaine. I guess she wasn't well received b/c she didn't make it into any further seasons thankfully. She was quite annoying. However, keep in mind she is only in the first season and then we are treated to the entry of her cousin as her replacement. She is so much more appealing. All the village's characters are loveable quirky people who play off the curmudgeon Doc Martin extremely well. I recommend just going ahead and purchasing the complete collection of seasons 1-4 instead of buying them separately b/c, for one thing, it's cheaper in the long run if you like the whole series and also b/c the individual season 1 did not have subtitles which for us was a necessity since we Southerners had difficulty understanding the thick British accents. This show is such a treat and you certainly don't have to be in the medical field to appreciate it.

Catherine Catz is equally compelling as Louisa, the town's schoolteacher, whose on-again-off-again romance with Doc is itself enough to keep a person anticipating the next episode. However, there's far more to it than this that makes the entire series addictive. In addition to the great acting not just by Clunes and Catz but by all the other characters, the dialogue is amazing. (The screenwriters are truly geniuses.) Moreover, each episode is full of plots and subplots, skillfully woven together to form a seamless whole.

Each story focuses around some kind of medical challenge or puzzle, while also allowing time for the ill-mannered doctor to interact with an array of eccentric locals.  As the series progresses, viewers learn more about Martin and get a sense of why he behaves the way he does.

He, therefore, cannot perform surgery anymore so becomes a GP, family physician in a village in Cornwall where his aunt (Stephanie Cole) lives.  The people of Cornwall are not hillbillies as one reviewer stated, but are an isolated people who are very attached to their villages and ways.  Cornwall is a place where artists like to gather and the beauty of the surrounding countryside is a pleasure to see.  Since I am from England, I can really appreciate the country, people, accents and scenery.  I understand the dialect and the language spoken in this series which make it much more pleasant to see.This is a program for many people to watch who have a particular sense of humour as the 'Doc.' who is an abrasive, arrogant, pompous person stands for no nonsense from anyone.  He is direct and to the point but gets himself into so many situations he cannot understand (typical of a surgeon) as he does not talk with patients, rather he talk AT patients.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[0, 0]","DOC MARTIN (seasons 1-4, 2004-2010, season 5, 2010-2011 sold separately, originally broadcast on UK's ITV1) is all about poor Dr. Martin Ellingham ('Doc Martin'), stuck in the mythical Cornish fishing town of Portwenn (actually Port Isaac) - one of the several things I adore about this show. Everything is shot on location in and around Port Isaac, so the town serves as an additional character. Beautiful place. Boscastle is listed as the location for season 1, but actually I know nothing about that.In case you lived in a hole with no PBS, Doc Martin gets stuck serving in the town of Portwenn after suddenly developing a severe blood phobia. I love the fact that Doc's surname, Ellingham, is an anagram of the series creator/writer, Dominic Minghella (creator/writer ofHamish MacBeth: Series 1-3 Collectionand uncle of super-cute actor Max Minghella). Especially interesting because only the Doc calls himself that - everyone else of course calls him Doc Martin. Thanks to his feisty old Aunt Ruth Ellingham (immortal Eileen Atkins), the Doc finds a job awaiting him in Cornwall when he is forced to leave his hospital.Martin Clunes, whom I also adore, did some films -Saving Grace, DOC MARTIN and DOC MARTIN AND THE LEGEND OF THE CLOUTIE (all here:Doc Martin: The Movies) in which he played a Dr. Martin 'Doc Martin' Bamford; allegedly this excellent series is claimed to have been inspired by those films, but the character is completely different. Doc Martin has an acid tongue, a quiet, dangerous growl, an autistic incomprehension of the humans around him, and an evil bedside manner. The goofy, cheerful folks of Port Wen don't really care - they know all about Doc, and don't even try to steer clear of him.This is a naturally funny 'dramedy'-style series, one of those precious breaths of fresh British (Cornish!) air, that I just love and don't ever see often enough. The acting is sharp and spot-on; the humor is 1st rate; the series has adult themes but in my opinion is a fine family series to own. All I can do to conclude this is outline a few of my personal favorite episodes:-""Always On My Mind"": Doc Martin and his auntie struggle with a man, Phil Pratt (the great Roger Lloyd-Pack ofHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) who loses his wife and blames Doc; a sort of comic tragedy exposes a vital fact about this man at the end. This has to be one of the funniest television episodes of anything I have ever seen!Sorry, folks, can't find the titles from here forward, you'll see them if you buy the collection!-Doc deals with a young war veteran who copes with his PTS by having a giant imaginary rabbit as a friend.-Doc deals with two brothers and their dangerously crazy father.-Doc comes grievously close to declaring his love for sexy school marm Louisa (stunningly gorgeous Caroline Catz). Actually, Doc doesn't seem to be absolutely certain what love really is.-Early in season one, Doc deals with the cancer diagnosis of an old hippy neighbor (Jeff Rawle again of HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE) and has to return to his old stomping grounds only to hear people prattling about why he left.",5,One of the best TV shows ever produced,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",2012,3123,"['DOC', 'MARTIN', 'seasons', '1-4', '2004-2010', 'season', '5', '2010-2011', 'sold', 'separately', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'UK', 'ITV1', 'poor', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Ellingham', 'Martin', 'stuck', 'mythical', 'Cornish', 'fishing', 'town', 'Portwenn', 'actually', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'one', 'several', 'things', 'adore', 'show', 'Everything', 'shot', 'location', 'Port', 'Isaac', 'town', 'additional', 'character', 'Beautiful', 'place', 'Boscastle', 'listed', 'location', 'season', '1', 'actually', 'know', 'nothing', 'that.In', 'case', 'lived', 'hole', 'PBS', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'stuck', 'serving', 'town', 'Portwenn', 'suddenly', 'developing', 'severe', 'blood', 'phobia', 'love', 'fact', 'Doc', 'surname', 'Ellingham', 'anagram', 'series', 'creator/writer', 'Dominic', 'Minghella', 'creator/writer', 'ofHamish', 'MacBeth', 'Series', '1-3', 'Collectionand', 'uncle', 'super-cute', 'actor', 'Max', 'Minghella', 'Especially', 'interesting', 'only', 'Doc', 'everyone', 'else', 'course', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Thanks', 'feisty', 'old', 'Aunt', 'Ruth', 'Ellingham', 'immortal', 'Eileen', 'Atkins', 'Doc', 'job', 'awaiting', 'Cornwall', 'when', 'forced', 'leave', 'hospital.Martin', 'Clunes', 'whom', 'also', 'adore', 'did', 'films', '-Saving', 'Grace', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'DOC', 'MARTIN', 'THE', 'LEGEND', 'THE', 'CLOUTIE', 'here', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'Movies', 'played', 'Dr.', 'Martin', 'Martin', 'Bamford', 'allegedly', 'excellent', 'series', 'claimed', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'films', 'character', 'completely', 'different', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'acid', 'tongue', 'quiet', 'dangerous', 'growl', 'autistic', 'incomprehension', 'humans', 'evil', 'bedside', 'manner', 'goofy', 'cheerful', 'folks', 'Port', 'Wen', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'know', 'Doc', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'steer', 'clear', 'him.This', 'naturally', 'funny', ""'dramedy'-style"", 'series', 'one', 'precious', 'breaths', 'fresh', 'British', 'Cornish', 'air', 'just', 'love', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'see', 'often', 'enough', 'acting', 'sharp', 'spot-on', 'humor', '1st', 'rate', 'series', 'adult', 'themes', 'opinion', 'fine', 'family', 'series', 'own', 'can', 'do', 'conclude', 'few', 'personal', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'My', 'Mind', 'Doc', 'Martin', 'auntie', 'struggle', 'man', 'Phil', 'Pratt', 'great', 'Roger', 'Lloyd-Pack', 'ofHarry', 'Potter', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'who', 'wife', 'Doc', 'sort', 'comic', 'tragedy', 'vital', 'fact', 'man', 'end', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'television', 'episodes', 'anything', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Sorry', 'folks', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'titles', 'here', 'forward', ""'ll"", 'see', 'buy', 'collection', '-Doc', 'deals', 'young', 'war', 'veteran', 'who', 'PTS', 'having', 'giant', 'imaginary', 'rabbit', 'friend.-Doc', 'deals', 'two', 'brothers', 'dangerously', 'crazy', 'father.-Doc', 'grievously', 'close', 'declaring', 'love', 'sexy', 'school', 'marm', 'Louisa', 'stunningly', 'gorgeous', 'Caroline', 'Catz', 'Actually', 'Doc', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'absolutely', 'certain', 'what', 'love', 'really', 'is.-Early', 'season', 'one', 'Doc', 'cancer', 'diagnosis', 'old', 'hippy', 'neighbor', 'Jeff', 'Rawle', 'again', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'GOBLET', 'OF', 'FIRE', 'return', 'old', 'stomping', 'only', 'hear', 'people', 'prattling', 'about', 'why', 'left']",N/A

We're hooked in the worst way. Some times we'll watch as many as 4 episodes back to back.Here's the scoop. This is a fish out of water tale. Dr. Martin Ellingham is a hot shot surgeon in London. The preassures of the job finally hit him in an unexpected way. It causes him to contract a fear of blood, the sight of which makes him violently ill. As a result he is forced to pack his bags and take a job as a G.P. in Portwenn, Cornwall, where he finds himself at odds with an eccentric bunch of locals who drive him mad. But Portwenn is also home to a lovely school teacher. Though she is quite his opposite, he takes a shine to her. Can he find true love?This is a hoot. Martin Clunes creates a great character with the doctor. He absolutely must wear a suit and tie each day though there is little need to. He must have his espresso each morning and he lacks even the most basic interactive skills. But he's an incredible doctor which is why the local school marm fancies him as much as he does her. She's a doll. She's pretty without being glamorous and she has a nice way about her. There are some other locals that are also painted well, such as the doctor's aunt who often manages to let him know when he's screwing up.It's generally written very well. One of the drawbacks of watching episodes back to back is you see when the writers need to force a plot point and put a character...out of character. And he runs into too many exotic maladies for such a tiny hamlet. But these instances do little to hurt the overall enjoyment. I also like the main musical theme, which is very cool and is repeated in different arrangements throughout the episodes. It's fun picking it out during the various scenes.The setting of Portwenn is idyllic. It is a trully lovely place and lends itself effortlessly to the camera. You want to be there.This is just a solid, fun effort all the way around. It's very British and handles itself in a way only the British can.

1412558,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B004KVXCB4,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[84, 88]","Why so funny? A surgeon is mentally and physically indisposed at the sight of blood. You will laugh at quirky townsfolk in this serene, beautiful little seaside Cornwall town of Portwenn. Laughter happens with most scenes through 30 episodes of this 9 DVD collection. Often I raise eyebrows to the Mrs (we watched together), she picks up a corner of her mouth, and again we're belly laughing.We thoroughly enjoyed all stories and weird but lovable characters in this small fishing berg. Doc Martin (Martin Clunes-'Dirty Tricks' 'Demob' 'Lorna Doone') is stern, grumpy, all-business, rude, and shows a heartless bedside manner, adding to the hilarity--as he fails to see any of the villagers' joy and friendliness. The medical conditions he addresses are often as hilarious as the symptom complainants. Mix in romances, mysteries, and even some touching moments. Some of the best British Comedy/Drama ever produced. A photogenic setting backdrop to LOL hilarious activity in a doctor's wee-town life.About the only thing that compares to this collection of fun-but-wierd characters is...well, Portwenn is a British Mayberry R.F.D. Cornwall corny (filmed in Port Isaac, beautiful quaint fishing port.) Eccentric locals include Aunt Joan (Stephanie Cole-'A Bit of a Do' 'Housewife,49' 'Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day') slightly sane; teacher Louisa (Caroline Cutz-'The Guilty' 'The Vice') worthy of romance; surgery receptionist Pauline (Katherine Parkinson) is outrageously funny wanting a man; Large Jr., Al (Joe Absolom) son of Bert Large (Ian McNeice-'Oliver Twist' 'Rome')plumber turned chef (don't order soup). That's just the short-list of a crazy cast that keeps a tapestry of sub-plots moving fast.A family series, which does have a series 4 'graphic medical scene' warning due to numerous accidents involving some blood for Doc Martin to gag or spew from. This surgeon's blood phobia is part of the absurd humor. If you love English seaside village views and homespun humor, this will do...and make you beg for more.

One look at the way his father and mother treat him during a disagreeable visit to Port Wenn, and to a great degree you can realize much of why Martin is the way he is.

I have never been inclined to watch medical shows (like Grey's Anatomy and the like), but my sister, who is a doctor mentioned several times that she had been wathcing ""Doc Martin"" on Netflix, so in desperation one night I turned it on thinking I wouldn't watch for more than a few minutes before looking for something else. The rest is history, because I became instantly hooked,watching the first four seasons in less than a week; and then just as I became addicted to the most charming show I've ever watched in a lifetime, I came to the end of the 31st episode only to see that Netflix ended it there. Now as a result I am suffering withdrawal symptoms, and immeiately ordered season 5 despite its inordinate costs compared to the unlimited streaming I get on Netflix for $8 a month. Perhaps part of my addiction is due to my Nostalgia for England, where I went to school in Newbury, Berkshire from age 6-12, and even more to Cornwall which I've never seen but nevertheless written novels about.

I treated myself to the series 1-4 boxset and I watched them all over the course of 2 days and now I cannot wait for the 5th series. I just moved to America and brought all my ""stuffy"" British comedy which the American population ""doesn't get"" (I jest. My American wife and my in-laws find it all hilarious....well...mostly all of it. lol) and Doc Martin is the show i'm currently bombarding them with.As a Briton. I'm naturally biased for all of the good stuff that's produced there and some of you may be on the fence about viewing this but we do all speak the same language (after a fashion) and I promise you will enjoy the brilliant scripting and acting of this show and it's stars. It's really Top notch!On a side note, the character of Doc Martin was co-created by Craig Ferguson (Yes, the very same 'Late Late Show' host) for a wonderful 2000 film which he also starred in called 'Saving Grace' Martin Clunes also played the Doc in this movie and it was also filmed in Port Isaac but as you'll notice if you watch that movie and this series that the character was the polar opposite of the Doc Martin we know today and (with no disrespect to Ferguson) his character is much better today. His grumpiness and inability to involve himself with the locals makes him a more like-able person, if that makes any sense, than the one he portrayed in 'Saving Grace' A tribute to Clunes' acting, no less.So all in all.

It is also time well spent viewing. The beauty of Cornwall cannot be surpassed. The locals are well portrayed and Doc Martin played by Martin Clunes is a study in the development of a gruff natured person turning over a new perspective in being more cognizent of others' emotional needs. He relys too much on logic like Mr. Spock in Star Trek but even more so. I loved it and also the love story between Martin and Louisa which  is moving and shows the real  development of human feelings and love. When a child is conceived they finally realize the need for each other but there are still difficulties ahead.
