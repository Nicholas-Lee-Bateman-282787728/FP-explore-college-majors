Somehow I did not feel that there was real chemistry between the two leading actors. I also did not feel any sympathy for the leading lady.  And then - there was simply too much nudity.  It's not that I am so prudish, but I honestly feel that the director was trying to shock his audience. Which would have been quite easy in the days when this movie was made. Now one seems much more nudity on the screen, but perhaps not such long scenes. It certainly will never make my list of &#34;best ever movies&#34;.",3,Well maybe never after September,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",2013,558,"['think', 'was', 'expecting', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'Somehow', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'was', 'real', 'chemistry', 'two', 'leading', 'actors', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'leading', 'lady', 'then', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'nudity', 'not', 'am', 'so', 'prudish', 'honestly', 'feel', 'director', 'was', 'trying', 'shock', 'audience', 'Which', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'easy', 'days', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'Now', 'one', 'much', 'more', 'nudity', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'not', 'such', 'long', 'scenes', 'certainly', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'list', '34', 'best', 'ever', 'movies', '34']",Until September VHS

I'm originally from a very small town in Ohio and I couldn't believe that 'they' actually got an ""art-house"" style movie to play where I was living...and I sincerely believe it's never happened again!What a wonderful surprise, knowing nothing about it before seeing it.Karen Allen and Thierry Lhermitte are beautiful together.  It's such a simple story (trip chaperone gets stuck in Paris after missing flight and starts affair with arrogant married frenchman) and yet the actors and location shots just meld together perfectly to create a most memorable, touching and funny film.If you like/love romantic films...Until September has got to be in your collection!!Peace.",5,Best Romantic Film EVER.....to me!,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,740,"['saw', 'film', 'teenager', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'believe', '1984-85', ""'m"", 'originally', 'very', 'small', 'town', 'Ohio', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'they"", 'actually', 'got', 'art-house', 'style', 'movie', 'play', 'where', 'was', 'living', 'sincerely', 'believe', 'never', 'happened', 'again', 'What', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'seeing', 'it.Karen', 'Allen', 'Thierry', 'Lhermitte', 'are', 'beautiful', 'together', 'such', 'simple', 'story', 'trip', 'chaperone', 'stuck', 'Paris', 'missing', 'flight', 'affair', 'arrogant', 'married', 'frenchman', 'yet', 'actors', 'location', 'shots', 'just', 'meld', 'together', 'perfectly', 'create', 'most', 'memorable', 'touching', 'funny', 'film.If', 'like/love', 'romantic', 'films', 'September', 'got', 'be', 'collection', 'Peace']",Until September VHS

I stumbled across it quite by accident two weeks ago and am amazed that I missed it all of these years.  Thierry Lhermitte and Karen Allen exude incredible on screen chemistry, and I very much enjoyed their banter and culture differences.  There are no words to describe the incredible Thierry Lhermitte.  I simply cannot recall a more charismatic actor nor anymore with more beautiful eyes than that of this actor.  I was so taken by him that I have since tried to get my hands on some of his other movies.  Although I am not a great fan of subtitles, I highly recommend &quot;The Dinner Game&quot;, a wonderful French comedy.
