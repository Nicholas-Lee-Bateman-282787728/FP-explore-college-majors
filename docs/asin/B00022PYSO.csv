821947,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00022PYSO,Crazy Jim,"[2, 3]","The second entry in the ""Beef"" series follows with more in-depth explorations of classic feuds. This time, the beefs include D-12 vs. Royce Da 5'9, KRS-One vs. Nelly, DMX vs. K-Solo, LL Cool J vs. Canibus, Westside Connection vs. Cypress Hill, and plenty others. This time, it's hosted by Keith David. It's only drawback is the missing Eminem vs. Benzino segment which was removed from the retail version due to complaints filed by The Source magazine. If you enjoyed the first 'Beef"", you'll want to see this one too. The interviews with KRS-One are worth it on their own. There's also a great story about Ice Cube going haywire in the Priority Records office.",3,"""Beef 2"" Review",1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,661,"['second', 'entry', 'Beef', 'series', 'more', 'in-depth', 'explorations', 'classic', 'feuds', 'time', 'beefs', 'include', 'D-12', 'vs.', 'Royce', 'Da', '5', '9', 'KRS-One', 'vs.', 'Nelly', 'DMX', 'K-Solo', 'LL', 'Cool', 'J', 'vs.', 'Canibus', 'Westside', 'Connection', 'Cypress', 'Hill', 'plenty', 'others', 'time', 'hosted', 'Keith', 'David', 'only', 'drawback', 'missing', 'Eminem', 'Benzino', 'segment', 'was', 'removed', 'retail', 'version', 'due', 'complaints', 'filed', 'Source', 'magazine', 'enjoyed', 'first', ""'Beef"", ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'one', 'too', 'interviews', 'KRS-One', 'are', 'worth', 'own', 'also', 'great', 'story', 'Ice', 'Cube', 'going', 'haywire', 'Priority', 'Records', 'office']",N/A

The Roxanne battles, EPMD, KRS&Nelly;, Canibus&LL;, And Ice Cube vs Cyprus Hill was dope but the DVD feels incomplete. The Grandmaster Caz vs. The SugarHill Gang beef that can be found in the extras should have been in the main movie. I would love to hear Big Ban Hank try to refute what Caz says.

821950,AXNZBEAXLVDBO,B00022PYSO,DJ I DA I,"[6, 6]","I find it very interesting that people rated this documentary so low.  It's obvious that they are looking for something instead of accepting it for what it is.  I applaud Q3 for his efforts because he kept it true to the culture of hip hop and its historic events.The segment on ""Roxanne"" may be uninteresting to those who didn't live through that era, but those of us who did remember how large those records were and even though it was ""Beef"", it remained on record and never indicated the taking of anothers life.  The younger generation is being drawn towards extreme violence because of what the music industry has done to hip hop in order to sell records.Many have forgotten EPMD, (which is without a doubt, one of the all time greatest hip hop groups) and how ""Business"" ended their reign is given it's due in this segement.  EPMD produced the Hit Squad (which would have rivaled the WU..yes I said it)Redman, Keith Murray, Das EFX, K-Solo, Molly G, with Sermon on the boards?  Just think...Ice Cube is a staple in hip hop history.  The Cypress Hill ""Beef"" was major because of the magnitude of people that could have gotten involved.  I can respect the Hill, but Cube has always been a Chameleon in hip hop.  From the Bomb Squad to ""hip hop started in the west""...Those who know..Know.It goes on and on with through breakdown of several historic battles.  The Nelly/KRS battle is the crux of hip hop's dilemia.  The corporation/hip hop culture battle.  The corporation has packaged hip hop into what the youth perceive it as...Nelly..when it is the culture of those that lived it that created hip hop...KRS.  Who you believe won the battle determines which aspect of hip hop your connected to.I failed to mention the LL/Canibus or the Royce 5'9/D12 issue, but they are done just as well.  Perhaps the most ironic victor of all these battles is Roxanne Shante.  You will have to see the DVD to understand my point.Bottom line this is a wonderful addition to the first.  All of these DVDs will be of the utmost importance as the years go by.  Those of us that understand the ""culture"" understand that it needs to be maintained.  Q3 has played his part in that.

That dude will stop at nothing to get it.  Now I understand why Nelly said ""It's too obvious"" that he was trying to get the spotlight.  I used to think KRS was cool, but once I heard him ask his fans to boo Nelly and boycott Nelly's album, I lost a lot of respect for that due.  Boycotts and disrespecting folks at their concerts should be reserved for those who deserve it--at least let them be doing something negative. That beef was like two third graders and one of 'em was saying ""I don't like him, so you can't either!"" Speaking of that, must Mack 10 always be a groupie.  I GAINED respect for Dub-C for staying out of the beef with Cypress Hill. )Note: I'm sorry, but Cube's version was better than Cypress Hill's version. But regardless of that, Cube was DEAD WRONG and I hope he apologized.)  As for the clowns vs. Eminem, that dude made himself look absolutely stupid with those shirts talking about ""... look good in these.""  That dude sounded like he was on some heavy drugs the whole time he was being interviewed and I don't understand why Eminem even asked them to be at that party.  I thought Eminem was right to respond the way he did--he put some nobody's on a cover to try to promote THEIR career and now they're mad 'cause they were stupid enough to turn 'em down.
