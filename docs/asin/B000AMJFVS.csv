928650,AFSBKKDFLZZX5,B000AMJFVS,Mark Anderson,"[3, 3]","As the title indicates, this is a live performance by Average White Band during the Montreaux Jazz Festival in July 1977. This is a very good DVD of AWB at its peak. Considering that this was shot before the days of VCRs, DVDs and music videos, one has to congratulate Claude Nobs and the Montreaux Jazz Festival for having had the foresight to videotape this concert at a time when there was no mass market for concert videos.Amazon has not included a complete set list on this DVD so here it is:1./ Pick Up The Pieces2.  Work To Do3./ A Love Of Your Own4./ Person To Person5./ Got The Love6./ Sweet And Sour7./ Cut The Cake8./ I Heard It Through The GrapevineBonus Tracks1./ If I Ever Lose This Heaven2./ I'm The One3./ T.L.C.The sound on this DVD is good but the camera work and editing are pretty sloppy in places. The director often calls for extreme close up head shots that are basically looking straight up the performer's nostrils. In other extreme close ups the director calls for shots of instruments which make little visual sense; a lengthy shot (about 10 seconds or so) of the sound hole on a saxophone during a sax solo is one example that comes to mind. The cameras are often shooting directly into the overhead stage lights which, given the video camera technology of the day, essentially washed out the shot. So the video quality, while acceptable for 1970s video, is not great.On the bonus tracks, the director is only using one stationary camera set on a wide angle in front of the stage so the shot is of the entire atage while the band is performing. And that's it for camera work on the three bonus tracks! It's possible that these three tracks were shot during a sound check since there doesn't seem to be much evidence of an audience present during the three bonus tracks.But the sound quality on this DVD is good and that's what really matters.This is the Average White Band in concert in its heyday.

Infante ""Mike I.""","[14, 14]","Having had the opportunity to see AWB in person several times in the late 70s and early 80s, I was thrilled to find out that there is FINALLY a DVD capturing the band's live performance at the peak of their trade.  This is an incredible DVD capturing an energetic and FUN-KY performance.  The video quality is dated -- looking almost like it was filmed by a personal video camera.  But what it lacks in video quality is made up in the excellent DTS remixing of the audio.  AWB has not sounded better live since they performed live.Compared to other DVDs with the later incarnations of the band, this DVDs is heads & shoulders above.  If you are an AWB fan, this is a MUST OWN.  If you're too young to remember anything about AWB (except maybe Pick Up The Pieces) this concert will show you how it was done Old School style:  real musicians, playing real music LIVE ... and dripping with soul.

Regretfully though they did another performance of Pick Up The Pieces (22 minutes long and not the version included with this DVD) during the night as they jammed with many other great musicians.  This performance can be found on a rather obscure (and never released on CD) record album called ""The Atlantic Family Live At Montreux"". The record is avaialble if you search online, but is going for a higher price.  However if you are a AWB fan you must have this version.  It is the best jam I've ever heard.  This version can also be heard, but cut by 15 minutes, on their re-release of AWB. Why it was cut I'll never understand.  It was from the same record label and it had plenty of space to fit it all.
