I loved every actor in this movie. Harry Connick was sensational, Gena Rowland is perfect, and the little girl who played Bernice did exceptionally well.

Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick, Jr., made a great pairing as a potential couple and each managed to skillfully portray a character with conflicts and hurts resulting from a complicated situation, and best of all they did it convincingly.

The portrayal of small-town life and the grudges about incidents, either real or imagined, that people tend to hold is well done in this movie.

Gena Rowlands and Harry Connick Jr.portray characters with a lot of warmth as they help Birdie and her daughter deal with having to rebuild their lives. The potrayal of Birdie's wayward and weak-willed husband is admirable,too.  People can relate to this film at different levels. For many, it could serve as a warning against early marriages and the need to focus on higher education before marriage, which could have afforded Birdie a better job once she had to find one for herself, and considering how Birdie had to face those she had once tormented after being humiliated on national television, we see how the following adage still rings true:""Be nice to people you meet on your way up because you may have to deal with them again on your way down.""",3,A Typical Scenario for Many Who Experience Early Prestige,995328000,"07 17, 2001",2001,1426,"['South', 'especially', 'full', 'women', 'Birdie', 'Calvert', 'who', 'marry', 'early', 'then', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'badly', 'portrayal', 'small-town', 'life', 'grudges', 'incidents', 'either', 'real', 'imagined', 'people', 'tend', 'hold', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'chord', 'especially', 'can', 'identify', 'having', 'leave', 'beautiful', 'pink', 'brick', 'house', 'one', 'state', 'live', 'rather', 'weather', 'beaten', 'one', 'rather', 'hostile', 'environment', 'Texas', 'experience', 'came', 'complete', 'bullying', 'female', 'schoolmate', 'Big', 'Dolores', '.But', 'confrontation', 'scene', 'Birdie', 'Dot', 'get', 'hint', 'what', 'might', 'one', 'day', 'happen', 'Bernice', 'Dolores', 'Gena', 'Rowlands', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.portray', 'characters', 'lot', 'warmth', 'help', 'Birdie', 'daughter', 'deal', 'having', 'rebuild', 'lives', 'potrayal', 'Birdie', 'wayward', 'weak-willed', 'husband', 'admirable', 'too', 'People', 'can', 'relate', 'film', 'different', 'levels', 'many', 'could', 'serve', 'warning', 'early', 'marriages', 'need', 'focus', 'higher', 'education', 'marriage', 'could', 'have', 'afforded', 'Birdie', 'better', 'job', 'had', 'find', 'one', 'herself', 'considering', 'how', 'Birdie', 'had', 'face', 'had', 'once', 'tormented', 'being', 'humiliated', 'national', 'television', 'see', 'how', 'following', 'adage', 'still', 'true', 'Be', 'nice', 'people', 'meet', 'way', 'up', 'may', 'have', 'deal', 'again', 'way', 'down']",N/A

This fictional version starts with an unfaithful spouse and in Birdee(Bullock)'s most despairing days, offers a possible new romance (with Harry Connick, Jr. Imagine THAT man singing to you . . . yum). Returning home after her husband dumps her on national TV, Birdee must rebuild her life amid ridicule from everyone in her hometown. Once a snooty homecoming queen, she must now grovel to people she once lorded over. The part is difficult -- believable ex-snooty, believable depression, believable painful recovery -- and Bullock does it well. Directed with grace by Forest Whitaker, it also stars Gena Rowlands -- who always makes a movie better -- playing the part of Birdee's eccentric taxidermist mother whose quirky ways and no-nonsense parenting are infuriating and hilarious. The one to watch, though, is Mae Whitman in the part of Birdee's daughter, Bernice. Today she's probably best known as Amber in Parenthood but even in 1998 she was wonderful and vulnerable and funny.

The story-line is about Birdee (Sandra Bullock) being scammed to appear on a TV sleaze show ostensibly to get a free makeover only to hear her best friend (yeah, sure) disclose that she's been having an affair with her husband for the last year!!!...then--rubbing rock salt in the wound--the husband comes on camera and confirms the shocker.The next we see of Birdee, she's packing the station wagon with the help of her elementary school daughter Bernice and they're off to Grandma's house in the small town where Birdee grew up in Texas--where they're ALL talking about it having seen (and recorded in some instances) the nationwide TV broadcast.  Being the main gossip even before Birdee arrives, she 1] gets her nose rudely rubbed in it, 2] her Mother's heartfelt but sometimes unfeeling advice to ""get on with your life"", 3] Bernice turns on Birdee with insinuations, then screaming ""It's all YOUR fault!"" adoring her father (for all the wrong reasons she finds out).  But WAIT!!!...do I hear a White Knight riding to the rescue?YES!!!...in the person of Jason Matesse, a highschool friend who's been carrying the torch for Birdee all these years.  Portrayed by Harry Connick Jr., he gently helps Birdee confront her self-pity/self-doubt/self-recrimation with smooth straight talk, knowingly (from his own experience?) guiding her back to being the girl he knew and the woman she was prior to the TV fiasco with tender and solicitous attention and the occasional confrontational scene, always being there for her AND letting her know how he feels about her.

Because of its cast and its advance publicity, it was a movie I really wanted to like....While the framework of romantic movies may be small, there are still standards we expect them to meet. While ""Hope Floats"", it often comes dangerously close to capsizing. It is below par in almost every area.One always elusive element is chemistry between the two main characters. Bogart and Becall had it, as did Tracy and Hepburn. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks had it in ""Sleepless in Seattle"". Sandra Bullock and Harry ConnickJr., don't have it. In part, this may be because Connick, with his New Orleans musician background, is fundamentally too sophisticated for Bullock, who was one of the film's producers. The rest of the problem is script related. Bullock's character has a lot of excess baggage, which interferes too often with the love affair. Connick plays a man that Bullock went to high school with. He was the first boy to kiss her. As written, she had almost no interest in him then. Since there seems to be nothing special about him now, he comes off as more of a last resort than as her one true love.In today's society, the majority of people have gone through a divorce. Small children are increasingly included in romantic films. In ""Hope Floats"" Bullock has a daughter. When they go back to her home town to live with her mother, played by Gena Rowlands, we discover a little boy. He has been dumped there by Bullock's screen sister. This arrangement seems to be permanent. I have no problem with the inclusion of children in such a movie. In this case, we find ourselves focused on the lives of the children. Again, this is something caused by the unfocused script.How fragmented is the story line? The answer is that the only way they could tie up all the loose ends was to end most dramatic scenes in ...[low cost] hackneyed music video fashion.There are some good things about ""Hope Floats"". As the children, Mae Whitman and Cameron Finley give sterling performances. While both have had substantial acting experience, neither are old enough to know they are in a love story that doesn't work. Fort Smith, Texas, the setting for the movie, is a real town. It is handsomely photographed.

This film is more proof of that.Growing up in a small town, Birdee Pruitt (played by Bullock) was something special. The pretty and popular girl who got the boy who was the popular football hero. They married, had a daughter and in a few years life came crashing down around her.  Turns out she married an ass who was having an affair with their next door neighbor, who (Birdee thought) was her best friend. And they picked the worst way possible to break the news to her -- blindsiding her on national tv.Birdee has no college, no job experience, no husband, no best friend - and so she heads home to moms with daughter in tow, to try to get her bearings and figure out what to do next.Naturally, the whole town saw (or heard of) the whole humiliating tv show - and many of them seem to take pleasure in watching the girl who had it all, fall on her face.  With encouragement (and a shove or two) from her mom, Birdee does her best to cope and get on with life... and Bullock expertly takes us emotionally right there with her through it all as she ""gets a little of her own back"" and bravely forges a new life.Her daughter and her sister's boy (living with her mom) are wonderful stories of their own within the movie and absolutely wonderful little actors (the little girl should've won some type of award really), and Gena Rolands just shines throughout the movie as the quirky, sunny mom. [As always, Harry Connick, Jr. absolutely sucks as an actor - but the movie manages to still be good in spite of him.]It's a wonderful story with heart and a good ending (as all of Bullock's films seem to have).  Would have to classify this as a ""chick flick"" (not likely to be on most men's top 10 lists), but well done.  I've enjoyed this MANY MANY times and the magic formula still holds true - if Bullock is in it it's going to be a good movie. Enjoy!",4,A chick flick - but a WONDERFUL one.

448562,A33T53Y0PA7ZXA,6305108277,Niki M.,"[2, 4]","I really shouldn't like this movie but I do.  However, I gave it four stars SOLELY because of the acting and soundtrack. Sandra Bullock and Harry Connick Jr. were fantastic to watch and the music was a delight to listen to if you like pop-country.  If the director had casted any other actors for the roles, it definitely would have flopped.  Bullock and Connick have such an irrisistable charm about them that you can't help but love to watch them act.On the other hand, albeit a wonderful actress, Bullock's daughter in this movie was so irritating and unlikeable she spoiled the magic of the moment for me every time she appeared on screen.  I cringed when she opened her mouth.  I could see why her father didn't want her (just kidding...not really).  If I had been like her growing up my father would have driven off leaving me on the side of a road too.  The only redeeming aspect of the daughter's role was to show how difficult a divorce is on a child and how a mother's love will get them through.  In spite of unfairly being bombarded with insults and rejection (annoyingly throughout the ENTIRE movie) from her daughter, we saw a mother who will love and support her child no matter what.  Sorry fathers, the movie didn't portray you very well.On another sour note, this movie lacked direction, character development, continuity, and any kind of substantial plot to follow.  Viewers are just along for the ride without one scene having much to do with another. Characters and scenes were thrown together with no rhyme or reason--seemingly, just to move the movie along to the end.  I found myself saying, ""Huh?"" a lot to aspects of the story that just didn't make sense.  Perhaps I blinked and missed something that provided a rational explanation.There aren't enough bad things to say about this movie.  It is supposed to be a love story but all we see of the true romance is in the few remaining minutes of the movie. Forget this being a ""love"" story; it is more like a ""reject"" story: Husband rejects wife. Daughter rejects mother. Father rejects daughter. Woman rejects man. Town rejects man.  Town rejects woman. Daughter rejects man. Mother rejects son, etc.... With all this rejecting going on it's no wonder that the actual love part doesn't come out until the very end.Director, Forrest Whitaker, ought to be ashamed of himself for dropping the ball on this one.  Although to be fair, I now understand that the studio pulled support during production and several key scenes weren't filmed. After Bullock put in her own money to get the film finished, they shot a make-shift ending and edited together the footage they had already filmed. Unfortunately, knowing why a movie is a mess doesn't make it any easier to watch.In spite of itself, this movie is as charming as it is horrifically directed and edited.  For some reason (i.e., Bullock and Connick) it works.  I have watched this movie many times over and never tire of it.  You'll enjoy it too if you can suspend the movie critic within you and overlook the glaringly obvious megaholes in the storyline.  Just sit back and enjoy the sweet simplicity of this movie.  It's a 155-minute bumby ride but the 2-minute heartfelt emotional ending will definitely leave you emotionally fulfilled.",4,A Charmingly Bad Movie,1153440000,"07 21, 2006",2006,3262,"['really', 'should', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'do', 'However', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'SOLELY', 'acting', 'soundtrack', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Harry', 'Connick', 'Jr.', 'were', 'fantastic', 'watch', 'music', 'was', 'delight', 'listen', 'like', 'pop-country', 'director', 'had', 'casted', 'other', 'actors', 'roles', 'definitely', 'would', 'have', 'flopped', 'Bullock', 'Connick', 'have', 'irrisistable', 'charm', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'watch', 'act.On', 'other', 'hand', 'wonderful', 'actress', 'Bullock', 'daughter', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'irritating', 'unlikeable', 'spoiled', 'magic', 'moment', 'time', 'appeared', 'screen', 'cringed', 'when', 'opened', 'mouth', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'father', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'just', 'kidding', 'not', 'really', 'had', 'been', 'growing', 'up', 'father', 'would', 'have', 'driven', 'off', 'leaving', 'side', 'road', 'too', 'only', 'redeeming', 'aspect', 'daughter', 'role', 'was', 'show', 'how', 'difficult', 'divorce', 'child', 'how', 'mother', 'love', 'will', 'get', 'through', 'spite', 'unfairly', 'being', 'bombarded', 'insults', 'rejection', 'annoyingly', 'ENTIRE', 'movie', 'daughter', 'saw', 'mother', 'who', 'will', 'love', 'support', 'child', 'matter', 'what', 'Sorry', 'fathers', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'portray', 'very', 'well.On', 'sour', 'note', 'movie', 'lacked', 'direction', 'character', 'development', 'continuity', 'kind', 'substantial', 'plot', 'follow', 'Viewers', 'are', 'just', 'along', 'ride', 'one', 'scene', 'having', 'much', 'do', 'Characters', 'scenes', 'were', 'thrown', 'together', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'seemingly', 'just', 'move', 'movie', 'end', 'found', 'saying', 'Huh', 'lot', 'aspects', 'story', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'Perhaps', 'blinked', 'missed', 'something', 'provided', 'rational', 'explanation.There', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough', 'bad', 'things', 'say', 'movie', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'story', 'see', 'true', 'romance', 'few', 'remaining', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Forget', 'being', 'love', 'story', 'more', 'reject', 'story', 'Husband', 'wife', 'Daughter', 'mother', 'Father', 'daughter', 'Woman', 'man', 'Town', 'rejects', 'man', 'Town', 'woman', 'Daughter', 'man', 'son', 'etc', 'rejecting', 'going', 'wonder', 'actual', 'love', 'part', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'very', 'end.Director', 'Forrest', 'Whitaker', 'ought', 'be', 'ashamed', 'dropping', 'ball', 'one', 'be', 'fair', 'now', 'understand', 'studio', 'pulled', 'support', 'production', 'several', 'key', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'filmed', 'Bullock', 'put', 'own', 'money', 'get', 'film', 'finished', 'shot', 'make-shift', 'ending', 'edited', 'together', 'footage', 'had', 'already', 'filmed', 'Unfortunately', 'knowing', 'why', 'movie', 'mess', ""n't"", 'make', 'easier', 'watch.In', 'spite', 'movie', 'as', 'charming', 'horrifically', 'directed', 'edited', 'reason', 'i.e.', 'Bullock', 'Connick', 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'many', 'times', 'never', 'tire', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'too', 'can', 'suspend', 'movie', 'critic', 'overlook', 'glaringly', 'obvious', 'megaholes', 'storyline', 'Just', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'sweet', 'simplicity', 'movie', '155-minute', 'bumby', 'ride', '2-minute', 'heartfelt', 'emotional', 'ending', 'will', 'definitely', 'leave', 'emotionally', 'fulfilled']",N/A

Again his part is so goofy; he had a crush on the high school star and he's still worshipping her.  There's nothing to believe that he has grown since high school or that he sees her as an adult--not just the girl he idolized back then.  So we're supposed to believe that this will be the romance that will work for them, unlike the marriage she's just left.  It's not very realistic but it is rather pleasant and there's nothing to really hate here...except the daughter.

On to my review.....Gena Rowlands is Fantastic as the Momma, Harry Connick Jr. is simply charming as the ""wanna be"" Beau, the actor that played ""Travis"" was adorable and heartwarming, Bernice (the daughter of Sandra Bullock in the movie) was casted very well she was perfect as a stubborn, hurt and confused little girl trying to deal with the divorce of her Beloved Daddy and her (now seen as the enemy) Momma. Of course I can not leave out Sandra Bullock I was impressed with her ability to portray the hurt and the recovery of a women who has sunk to depression after her husband has found another, a mother that is struggling to keep it together for her child and a daughter that comes home to a town and a Mother that remembers her in a certain light.Forrest Whitaker did a tremendous job In my Honest Opinion with selecting this cast, creating scenes that make you feel all of what the characters are going through. From the Gena Rowlands character all the way to the children. I can not recommend this movie enough for anyone. Caution.... It's not light, there are some funny moments and there are some very sad moments.

448592,A1YQS7S1IE53SB,6305108277,Wendy C. Rigney,"[3, 3]","Sandra Bullock does a wonderful job as Birdee Pruitt, a woman who has the rug pulled out from under what she thinks is her idyllic existence as a homemaker on national television when her so-called best friend, luring Birdee on a Ricki Lake-type show for what she believes is a free makeover, announces she has been having an affair with Birdee's husband, Bill. An affair he has precious little remorse about.Humiliated and reeling, Birdee takes their daughter, Bernice, from the home she and Bill shared in Chicago and goes back home to Smithville, Texas, where Birdee sheepishly reminds her daughter she was ""Queen of Corn"" for three years straight. In Texas, where she was once a big fish in a small pond, Birdee hopes to lick her wounds. Once home, she reacquaints herself with her mother, Ramona, a somewhat offbeat woman played with zest by Gena Rowlands. (A classic line from her when she asks Birdee why she was on TV and Birdee answers, ""I just wanted a free makeover"" and Ramona responds, ""Well you got one!"" was superbly delivered.) She also reconnects with her nephew, Travis, being raised by his grandmother while Birdee's sister tries to make it as an actress in California. Travis acts out his abandonment issues in an odd fashion, in costumes and as various characters, which Ramona handles with equanimity, likely since she is a bit off center herself.In the midst of Birdee's humiliation and misery comes some matchmaking by her mother when old friend - and someone who crushed on Birdee from afar when in school - Justin Matisse drops by. Justin, played by Harry Connick, Jr, is a salt-of-the-earth type architect/construction worker. He clearly still has deep-seeded feelings for Birdee, feelings she is ill equipped to handle. Bernice does not handle the entrance of Justin into their lives well, secretly hoping for her parents to reconcile.What follows is a languid, slow-paced tale of Birdee wallowing in pity until Ramona sets her straight. When trying to find a job with almost no skills, some former classmates Birdee looked down upon waste no time in slyly rubbing her nose in it. Bullock plays a chagrined Birdee to perfection, making you feel for her and hoping she can get herself together. Along the way, a flirtation with Justin slowly turns into more, despite Birdee's continued antipathy about her marriage. Connick holds his own with Bullock, and I thought they had remarkable chemistry. One of the best scenes in the film is when Justin and Birdee dance. Connick and Bullock apparently trained with Patsy Swayze, and likely did her proud. They clearly looked like they were having a blast. The subsequent scene at the house Justin brings Birdee to, one he is building, is very romantic and gentle. Those adjectives sum up the relationship quite well.Of course, no would-be romance would be complete without conflict, and, as mentioned, Bernice's resistance provides plenty. Mae Whitman as Bernice was compelling. She played a child of divorce achingly well, and even when acting out, you could see the hurt underneath it. The scene between her and Michael Par&eacute; was gut wrenching when Bill would not take his daughter home with him. Alas, the only flaw seems to be that Bill is shallowly characterized, the heartless guy who has no qualms about abandoning his family. But since it does happen, I can't be too harsh here.Add in other issues, such as Birdee's father battling the heartbreak of Alzheimer's disease and Ramona's eventual fate (I won't spoil it), and I admit, it is not always a ""light"" movie. But the romance keeps it from being too maudlin, and the family dynamic is as real as it gets. This is not to say there is no fun. See the aforementioned dancing...as well as a sweet scene as three generations of women - Ramona, Birdee, and Bernice have a little fun with ""I Can't Get Next To You.""Forest Whitaker does a credible job as director here. Overall, this movie seems to be about a woman's journey from long-time appendage to finding her own way, and it was handled deftly. Indeed, to be honest, it was about...hope. Hope for a new future, hope for a new life, and hope for new love with the one who always loved her.The romantic in me really,  truly loved it for those reasons. If you like the theme of ""second chances"" and romance with ""the one who almost got away"", I cannot recommend this movie enough.
