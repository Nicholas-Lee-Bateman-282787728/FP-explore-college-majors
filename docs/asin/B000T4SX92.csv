""Prajna Earth"" takes you through Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and continues on through Hindu Bali and on to Java.

The narrative is a work of art all in itself, as is the cinematography.  Each time I view them together, it's a new experience.  The director is a student of Tibetan culture who makes no pretense or even an attempt at mastery.  Something that took thousands of years to develop cannot be undone in one or two generations.  Nor can it be packaged for Western consumption.  The Trilogy is simple, and sublime.

This trilogy of DVDs is artistic, hypnotic, educational, intimate, and spiritual.  I first watched two of the films on PBS and waited for the third to air, but it never did.  So I decided to purchase the trilogy at amazon, which offers a very reasonable price.  Since they've arrived, I've watched all three and listened to the ambient music mix as I do my computer chores.  I don't often view films more than once or maybe twice, but I anticipate watching these a number of times and enjoying the hypnotic, relaxing music.I was blown away when I learned that it's Sharon Stone doing the narration on two of the DVDs (John Bush on the third).  Her voice is perfectly modulated for the subject matter.  I've also been introduced for the first time to the American Krishna Das's mesmerizing music.  In addition, there's a lovely dance sequence filmed on location on one of the DVDs as an ""extra"".I recommend this trilogy for anyone who's looking for a bit of peace and tranquility in a frantic world and wants to learn more about the many flavors of Asian Buddhism.",5,A trilogy for Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike,1317254400,"09 29, 2011",2011,1175,"['am', 'not', 'Buddhist', ""'ve"", 'long', 'had', 'fascination', 'eastern', 'philosophies', 'Yoga', 'Taoism', 'Buddhism', 'trilogy', 'DVDs', 'artistic', 'hypnotic', 'educational', 'intimate', 'spiritual', 'first', 'watched', 'two', 'films', 'PBS', 'waited', 'third', 'air', 'never', 'did', 'decided', 'purchase', 'trilogy', 'amazon', 'very', 'reasonable', 'price', ""'ve"", 'arrived', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'three', 'listened', 'ambient', 'music', 'mix', 'do', 'computer', 'chores', 'do', ""n't"", 'often', 'view', 'films', 'more', 'once', 'maybe', 'twice', 'anticipate', 'watching', 'number', 'times', 'enjoying', 'hypnotic', 'relaxing', 'music.I', 'was', 'blown', 'away', 'when', 'learned', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'doing', 'narration', 'two', 'DVDs', 'John', 'Bush', 'third', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'modulated', 'subject', 'matter', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'introduced', 'first', 'time', 'American', 'Krishna', 'Das', 'mesmerizing', 'music', 'addition', 'lovely', 'dance', 'sequence', 'filmed', 'location', 'one', 'DVDs', 'extra', '.I', 'recommend', 'trilogy', 'anyone', 'who', 'looking', 'bit', 'peace', 'tranquility', 'frantic', 'world', 'learn', 'more', 'many', 'flavors', 'Asian', 'Buddhism']",Journey Into Buddhism Trilogy
1088422,A2JAGHR2MLUX96,B000T4SX92,"See Em Gee ""Mr Gee""","[13, 15]","There are many beautiful places and people to enjoy here. I bought this to transport me from my living room to exotic lands to experience different cultures and customs. This set delivers. Although it primarily shows Buddhist temples, monks and other related sites, there is no philosophy being preached here, it is a simple journey through gorgeous lands. Don't worry about any religious overtones, there are none. Some of the tribal people are so colorfully dressed and ornamented, I never would have guessed that is what they wear.The films do suffer from technical difficulties - jerky and inappropriate camera movement (Photography 101 Never use Zoom), segments better left on the cutting room floor (for example the first film had to show us the boatman taking us upriver, but the 8 or 9 seconds were badly done as the boatman eludes us), better editing probably could have fixed most of the problems I saw, there were minor sound problems, and the change in narrators is uncomfortable. I enjoyed the last narration best as it included the film maker and guests who had something to add to the narration. Generally I don't think the narration is that strong, it's kind of an ordinary monotone overview, nothing particularly entertaining or educational. It doesn't add much to a scene to say ""the morning sun shines over the river"" when you show the morning sun shining over a river. There were many questions that filled my mind as the camera went from place to place, but unfortunately they weren't answered.The package is marked ""letterboxed"", but that's only partially correct: the first two discs are 4:3 or ""full"" screen format, only the last is widescreen format.I really appreciate the ability to turn off narration, which I did after the first viewing, now I only listen to the music and marvel at the sights presented. The music is varied and adds much, it is especially effective in surround sound. The bonus video of Vajra Realm did not impress me and seems a meandering and pointless addition.Overall the package is nicely done and should interest any armchair traveler who wants to see Buddhist temples and ceremonies of Southeast Asia, Laos, Thailand, Burma, Bali, Cambodia, Java, and Central Tibet. Some of the temples are truly amazing in size and detail, and the lands surrounding can be breathtaking.",4,Beautiful Journey to Exotic Places,1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,2324,"['are', 'many', 'beautiful', 'places', 'people', 'enjoy', 'here', 'bought', 'transport', 'living', 'room', 'exotic', 'lands', 'experience', 'different', 'cultures', 'customs', 'set', 'delivers', 'primarily', 'Buddhist', 'temples', 'monks', 'other', 'related', 'sites', 'philosophy', 'being', 'preached', 'here', 'simple', 'journey', 'gorgeous', 'lands', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'religious', 'overtones', 'are', 'none', 'tribal', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'colorfully', 'dressed', 'ornamented', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'guessed', 'what', 'wear.The', 'films', 'do', 'suffer', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'jerky', 'inappropriate', 'camera', 'movement', 'Photography', '101', 'Never', 'use', 'Zoom', 'segments', 'better', 'left', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'example', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'show', 'boatman', 'taking', 'upriver', '8', '9', 'seconds', 'were', 'badly', 'done', 'boatman', 'better', 'editing', 'probably', 'could', 'have', 'fixed', 'most', 'problems', 'saw', 'were', 'minor', 'sound', 'problems', 'change', 'narrators', 'uncomfortable', 'enjoyed', 'last', 'narration', 'best', 'included', 'film', 'maker', 'guests', 'who', 'had', 'something', 'add', 'narration', 'Generally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'narration', 'strong', 'kind', 'ordinary', 'monotone', 'overview', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'entertaining', 'educational', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'scene', 'say', 'morning', 'sun', 'shines', 'river', 'when', 'show', 'morning', 'sun', 'shining', 'river', 'were', 'many', 'questions', 'filled', 'mind', 'camera', 'went', 'place', 'place', 'unfortunately', 'were', ""n't"", 'answered.The', 'package', 'marked', 'letterboxed', 'only', 'partially', 'correct', 'first', 'two', 'discs', 'are', '4:3', 'full', 'screen', 'format', 'only', 'last', 'widescreen', 'format.I', 'really', 'appreciate', 'ability', 'turn', 'off', 'narration', 'did', 'first', 'viewing', 'now', 'only', 'listen', 'music', 'marvel', 'sights', 'presented', 'music', 'varied', 'much', 'especially', 'effective', 'surround', 'sound', 'bonus', 'video', 'Vajra', 'Realm', 'did', 'not', 'impress', 'meandering', 'pointless', 'addition.Overall', 'package', 'nicely', 'done', 'should', 'interest', 'armchair', 'traveler', 'who', 'see', 'Buddhist', 'temples', 'ceremonies', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'Laos', 'Thailand', 'Burma', 'Bali', 'Cambodia', 'Java', 'Central', 'Tibet', 'temples', 'are', 'truly', 'amazing', 'size', 'detail', 'lands', 'surrounding', 'can', 'be', 'breathtaking']",Journey Into Buddhism Trilogy
