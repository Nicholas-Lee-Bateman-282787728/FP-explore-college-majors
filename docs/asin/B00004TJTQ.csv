550736,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00004TJTQ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 16]","I am not a dog-lover in any way shape or form.  Cats, in my personal opinion, are the greatest pets that anyone could have.  Their ability to be self-existent is reason enough to put them ahead of dogs any day.  So, many of you may be asking, why would I rent a film like this if I didn't like dogs?  Two reasons.  First, I am a sucker for anything known as cinema, and two, there was quite a bit of popularity surrounding this film at the time of its release.  I remember hearing that Kevin Bacon could possibly win an award for his outstanding performance in this film and that it was one of those films that will make any person with a heart break into tears.  Oh, and I guess there was a third thing ... rumor had it that Clint Howard was in My Dog Skip, and for those that know me, I cannot pass up the opportunity to see Ron Howard's little brother in action!  So, I submerged myself into this film one fateful night and watched a clich&eacute; Hollywood story with some very decent acting attempt to pull at my heartstrings and moments of nostalgia.  I must admit, some of the rumors were correct.  Bacon, as well as others did some phenomenal acting in this little film, but it was the story that ultimately disappointed me.  I needed creativity, spontaneity, and excitement, alas, all I found was a simpleton story that could easily be found in any book dealing with dogs, pre-teens, summers, and social climbing while suffering from the classic Old Yeller syndrome.My Dog Skip doesn't hold back in using every classic Hollywood trick in the book when building the relationship between Willie and his dog, Skip.  From the dog becoming a part of the community to eventually saving lives while teaching lessons, My Dog Skip does not promote originality at all.  You could see the director, possibly with some note cards, talking to his crew about how other Hollywood hits like Turner & Hooch, Benji, or any of the Lassie series (either television or film) did it, and he would not like to stray far from the devices that these similar films used.  Would it have harmed director Jay Russell to be original, to take a stronger stance on developing the author Willie Morris' words a bit stronger.  This could have been a sensational film about friendship during the troubled years of America (i.e. the War and apparent racism in Mississippi), but instead Russell skirted around the issues and penetrated our hearts with a cute Muniz and a dog that was prepped for the camera.  I apologize about my cynicism towards this feature, but I witnessed a lack of respect as I watched this film for both the patrons in the audience and the time it was attempting to portray.  I wanted to see more honesty behind the script, instead of clich&eacute; Hollywood moments.  Even though this was developed as a ""children's film"", I believe that more should have been explained about the circumstances surrounding Dink, more should have been developed about the bootleggers, and more needed to be developed about the scattered racism in town.  Russell attempted to paint this beautiful image of rural Mississippi in 1942, but it felt that instead of using paint he used candy to gloss over some of the rougher edges.  There is a point when we must realize that children can accept the facts of our nation, and that a boyhood friendship can still grow strong even during times that we are not proud of.What is friendship?  According to My Dog Skip, friendship is helping an insecure someone reach a better point in their life.  Friendship means always being the initiator, while ultimately realizing that this same person may never repay the favor.  Do you not agree?  These were the ""life lessons"" that I learned from this film.  This is another hearty mistake that I believe hurt Jay Russell's feature.  Here we have Muniz unable to cope with the social struggles of life without the help outgoing and energetic Skip.  If it weren't for this dog, Willie Morris may never had broken free of those insecure shackles of life.  Yet, somehow, no praise is generated for this dog at the end.  Without giving anything away, the final note of this film is rather depressing, not due to the events that occur, but due to the actions of Morris.  I nearly shed a tear because I felt horrible that this dog was so exhaustingly great to this boy, yet Skip is slowly forgotten.  This is how I interpreted the final scenes, perhaps others saw it differently, but why was Willie Morris missing from the final moments?  Could someone help me?While I may not have great ideas to share about the plot of this film, I did think that the acting was a par above your typical ""dog befriends boy"" films.  Muniz does his job well considering being hired mainly for the ""cute"" element.  I do believe that over time Muniz looses that childish look that he could have literally patented.  He kept my eyes on the film, but it was Kevin Bacon's role that kept me glued to the screen.  Kevin Bacon continues to prove that no matter what part you give him, he will stand up and ensure that he gives his undivided attention to the character.  He will take you away from seeing Kevin Bacon on screen, and force you to see the character he is trying to create.  In this film, it is Willie's stern (yet human) father Jack Morris.  I believe an entire film could have been centered on Bacon's portrayal and possibly been better than what we witnessed here.  Diane Lane again demonstrates her ability to play the ""every woman"" role.  She needed to be handed more in this film to broaden her character.  Not enough meat was given to her to chomp on, which hurts one of the pivotal scenes early in the film.  Luke Wilson, well, he plays Luke Wilson.  If you have seen any of his films, than you have seen his portrayal in this feature.  He needed to reach deeper into the Born on the 4th of July moments to truly capture his character.  Dink is Luke and Luke is Dink.  Enough said.  Then, I cannot end without giving credit to Clint Howard.  He had too small of a role in this film and brought some brief moments of enjoyment to this reviewer.  Clint Howard is an undiscovered gem in Hollywood.  While his brother hogs the spotlight, Clint can honestly stand on his two feet in my book.  It was his portrayal of Millard in My Dog Skip that strengthened this mediocre film.Overall, I didn't like this film.  I cannot stress the fact that due to director Jay Russell's lack of ability to take risks, My Dog Skip eventually transformed into another typical ""dog helps boy become popular"" story.  There was no creativity or originality of the story (which in my eyes was too candy-coated even for the youngest of viewers), nor was there any respect for Skip near the end of the film.  The only plus I can give this film is for Kevin Bacon reaching higher with this small role than most actors would have.  This was one of those films where I believe the acting was directly in line for what it needed, but alas, the story was nowhere to be found.  Can we not be more creative in this genre Hollywood?Grade: ** out of *****",2,I was an only child.

They did a good job with the atmosphere and the lead character (played by the star of &quot;Malcolm In The Middle&quot;) was endearing. They seemed to leave a couple of subplots hanging though, such as the relationship with the black boy and the WWII veteran. Perhaps they had to cut those down for time. What really bugged me was the Father's injury occuring during the Spanish Civil war. I thought the only Americans that fought in that one were mercenaries or romantics (either political or otherwise). I didn't think we had an official presence there. The character of the father as portrayed by Kevin Bacon didn't strike me as someone who would fight for money or love.

Willie, as he was called, was born in November of 1934 in Jackson, Missippi but his family moved to Yazoo City, Missippi when he was only six months old.The story starts in 1943 when a puppy came into the life of Willie, who was an only child and was more interested in reading than sports. In the movie the part of Skip, who was a Fox Terrier, is portrayed by two Jack Russell Terriers, Moose, and Enzo who may be more familiar as they both played the part of Eddie, in the Fraser, sitcom.The movie does a good job of capturing the mood of the era, as a boy, growing up in Texas during that same period, I can relate to much of what is shown in the movie as being typical of that time in the South. Although the movie takes some liberties with the book, it does a good job of telling the story of Willie and Skip.There are some minor omissions in the story, such as Willie's attending and graduating from the University of Texas at Austin prior to his Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford but this doesn't interfere with the telling of the story of Willie and Skip.The movie is well cast and the acting and scenery all contribute to a movie that carries the viewer along on a trip down memory lane. It left me with a renewed appreciation for the precious beauty of life in all of God's creatures.It is interesting to note that Willie Morris was able to fly to New York for a preliminary screening of the movie in 1999; reports indicated he was delighted with the movie.

After reading about  three reviews on Amazon.com and the good reviews from the viewers (dog  lovers) out there, I had to give it a try.My wife and myself watched the  movie with our two dogs sitting next to us.  We love our dogs but I wanted  to watch the movie not because of the story of a boy and his dog (I could  have watched &quot;Ben&quot;) but because I wanted to see this touching  story and the relationship one has with their pets, that's what I was  interested in.After we were done watching, we were both in tears.  I  looked at my two dogs and it reminded me of how much these pets are a part  of our lives.  The storyline of a kid who is bullied and how his dog helps  him through his young life and eventually gains friends to the last 15  minutes which will nearly shatter your heart.  An emotional roller coaster  this movie turned out to be.Ok...as for the DVD, the audio is mostly  dialogue but the rear speakers are used pretty well.  Especially during  the baseball game.  The video is clear and the colors are good.  As for  the special features, you get two feature-length audio commentaries.  One  with Frankie Muniz and animal trainer Mathilde DeCagney and the other with  director Jay Russell.  It was cool to see the deleted scenes and part of me  wishes they left it in and I wish the director elaborated why he removed  them from the movie.  And of course, the ever loveable trailer and scene  selections which I don't count as special features (all DVD's should have  those).All in all, &quot;My Dog Skip&quot; is a wonderful movie.

550769,A3HQAPXAJV7PRX,B00004TJTQ,Diane Kistner,"[0, 5]","This little movie suffers from depending too heavily on the narrative from Willie Morris' original memoir to carry it cinematically. Whoever storyboarded the film did the absolute minimum to move it along and failed to conclude the movie in even a remotely satisfactory way. Showing the grown-up Willie Morris leaving for Oxford without giving his beloved dog Skip at least a loving goodbye head-scratching suggests whoever put this film together has never loved a dog. Some will find the few scenes of cruelty to Skip disturbing, but I found it more disturbing to see Skip apparently pining away on his master's empty bed until he died. What other take-away are we left with in the end?The bright spot in this film, for me, was Frankie Muniz as the young Willie Morris. I would praise the complex evolution of the shy boy's relationship with the bullies, if it had not been for the unbelievable, out-of-sequence reversion in the end to the stereotypical bully remarks. I found plenty of little stereotypes to bug me throughout the movie. For example, the constant dripping of ""chaw"" down the youngest bully's chin was pretty over the top, not to mention that the character was an overly stressed caricature of the ""ignorant hillbilly."" The evil moonshiners were cut out of cardboard. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane as the parents were believable, but few other actors were. (How could they be, as poorly constructed as the movie was?)The period depiction of the small racially segregated Mississippi town was okay, but the happy gloss put on the living conditions of the Negroes (the term ""Black"" was not used back then) and the sterile non-depiction of racial tensions merely accentuated how thin (and, dare I say, dishonest) the whole thing was. Yes, this film was targeted to families with children, but that is no excuse for whitewashing history. It's okay to terrify children with graveyard ghosts and boogeymen moonshiners who'd kill a dog (and probably kids, too), but it's not okay to expose them to a little historically factual information?I wanted My Dog Skip to be good enough to watch with a friend who loves ""Eddie"" on Frasier, but I'm certain he would dislike the film at least as much as I did.",2,I wanted to like it.

He was probably capable of more at this time in his career but was probably hindered by the director, who only touches at the edges of a scene, not capable of fully expressing the emotional meaning inherent. Example: at the end of the film, when the grown-up boy is leaving on the bus for college, he doesn't even look at the dog, or even acknowledge him. In my opinion, he should have been hugging him to his chest, next to the bus door, with an slightly embarressed tear in his eye, then hand him to the grown-up girlfriend. Then as the bus pulls away the dog leaps from her arms and runs along side the bus, with Frankie looking down and crying. The dog would come to a stop, with the bus driving away in the distance. Last shot, a great close up of the dog's face, with sad eyes. That would have opened the flood gates for me. Maudlin, perhaps...but that's what this story is all about. What is the most disconcerting is that Frankie and the dog do not seem to have a real relationship.

550790,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00004TJTQ,Joseph Haschka,"[0, 0]","It's 1942 in Yazoo City, in the Mississippi Delta. Nine-year old Willie (Frankie Muniz) is a lonely kid. Small, scrawny and physically uncoordinated, he's held in contempt by his peers. His Dad, Jack (Kevin Bacon), is stern and aloof, having lost a leg in the Spanish Civil War, of all places. (Why he was there at all is never explained.) Willie's only friend outside the family, his adult next-door neighbor and personal sports hero, Dink, has joined the Army, and is off to fight the Nazis. Realizing her son needs a pal (and a bit of responsibility), Willie's Mom, Ellen (Diane Lane), gets him a dog for his ninth birthday over the strenuous objections of Jack. (""He's not old enough!"") Enter Skip, a terrier puppy way too cute for words.MY DOG SKIP is a classic, family-oriented, G-rated story about a boy and his dog growing up together in small town America. And whether Willie is facing up to the local bullies, running afoul of moonshiners in the local cemetery, playing (ineptly) in a Little League game, watching a Saturday picture show at the local movie palace, or holding hands with the town's prettiest girl, Skip is there to provide moral support, a friendly lick, a happy bark, and a spirited wag of the tail. Disregarding for the moment that encounter with the moonshiners - a bit of a stretch even for Mississippi - the viewer loses himself in this charming reminiscence of a childhood with Man's Best Friend. It should rekindle fond memories in anyone who grew up with a pooch of his/her own. (I didn't. Our family had a succession of cats. But you know what I mean.)MY DOG SKIP, based on the true life experiences of Harper's magazine editor Willie Morris, is not a great film. But it's an eminently watchable one, mostly due to the antics of the lovable Skip. I don't think my cat liked it, but I certainly did.(It should here be noted that Willie Morris, a cat-hater most of his life, later came to have a feline Best Pal - a story of adult enlightenment told in the book MY CAT SPIT MCGEE.

Not only do they teach us nothing, they are also limited in the entertainment department. That's one reason you should grab a video like My Dog Skip. It isn't a perfect movie, but it is perfectly delightful. It is also one adults can sit through without groaning.It's 1943 in Yazoo City, Mississippi, and W.W.II is raging. Though the townsfolk face many sacrifices, life goes on apace. Nine year old Willie Morris [France Mount] is an only child who doesn't have friends because he is small for his age and bookish. The closest thing to a friend is next door neighbor Dink Jenkins [Luke Wilson], a star high school athlete. Willie idolizes him, but Dink is much older and will soon be inducted into the army. Jack and Ellen Morris [Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane] fret about how to help their son but disagree on a remedy. Ellen thinks they should get the boy a dog, but Jack, a stern, pensive man who lost a leg in a previous war, thinks Willie is too young. Ellen, a much more open and outgoing person, buys Willie a terrier puppy anyway. Jack protests but soon gives in, and Willie has his first true friend.Skip is one of the rare dogs that everyone in town everyone falls for, except for the bootleggers that operate out of the town cemetery. The dog's being so well liked gives Willie more and more confidence. Soon Skip is trotting all over town [Ah! The days before leash laws!] He scampers right into the grocery store to get his daily bologna fix. America, of course, was still segregated in 1943. This doesn't stop Skip from making friends in the 'colored section.' As Willie puts is, dogs are smarter than people because they are color blind. This is a dog that goes with Willie to the movies, has his own seat and shares the popcorn. This is a mutt that literally fixes the kid up with his first childhood sweetheart. While fiercely loyal to his master, Skip wisely lets him fight his own battles. By doing this, he helps Willie become fast friends with the neighborhood gang of boys.This picture is not all sweetness and light. There are a couple of scary scenes, and a few that will bring out the Kleenex, if for no other reason than that Skip is the kind of dog most of us wish we could have had as a kid.My Dog Skip is based on the nonfiction book of the same name by Willie Morris. Skip really was his dog, and this fact makes the movie even more poignant. Mr. Morris died shortly before the film's release.",4,An endearing film.

550816,A1CELN9NZ16HS3,B00004TJTQ,Movie Reveiwer,"[6, 7]","There is a rare breed of family films that  come out, that everyone will love. And I seriously believe that the last Family Friendly to love film was A Christmas Story, which for some reason became the premier holiday film for anyone. Now comes My Dog skip, an emotionally true film that holds a rare impact on anyone.  It is about a kid named Willie, who is a book worm, a loser at school and has really no friends. He then gets a cute Jack Russell Terrier for his 9th birthday. Then comes sayings like &quot;ohh, he is so cute&quot; out of your mouth. At that point you're about to hold a gun to your head thinking I have fallen for a sappy children film, that is sentimental and tacky. But really you become drawn to the film with its attractive, and well acted cast, of colorful stars.  Frankey Muniz from TV's Malcolm in The Middle plays Willie, and that is when you realize that he is actually a very good actor. Charming, good hearted and somewhat attractive on screen.  Diane Lane plays Willies mom, who gets him the dog. And Kevin Bacon plays his one legged dad, who is a war veteran. And Luke Wilson plays the hero next door who goes of to the war and comes back, a burned out drunk.  Doesn't seem to attractive? Well it actually is. My Dog skip supplies the regular, but still funny. I think my dog can do tricks, but when I tell him sit he rolls over, laughs. You know the stupid sentimental jokes in every dog movie imaginable.  But there is some adventure for the wanting kid soul, some spookiness of a dare-you-to go into the  graveyard thing, and of course the bad guys who a grave robbers. Who of course say some things to Willie that they probably don't men (but what if they Do?) That would be weird wouldn't it?  My Dog Skip wins over some serious hearts, with it's somewhat self aware snappy writing, some hearty laughs, and of course it also will pull about 3 tears from your eyes, make that 4, actually make that 5, to be honest probably about 50, and that isn't a joke.  It is a sentimental film about a boy and his dog. It is almost routine, and almost could be a bad film that is only appealing to kids. It is one I would have to recommend to anyone, if you want a good cry, but want to feel really uplifted. That is another plus, it has some dramatic intensity, that kids might not like, and a couple of scenes why you just have to yell &quot;NO!!!&quot; really loud at the screen, no matter what your age.  It is the most heartfelt film I have ever scene, and if you don't laugh, or cry, or enjoy, I would seriously get help, because you are the type of people that like to see dogs tortured. If you are one of those people, don't get near me. But if you are the types of people that either, like dogs, but don't want to own one, have a dog, but not sure you want to anyway, or your just the person who can't live with out a dog, then this is the film for you.  If you own a dog. After you watch all of the film, you just want to go give it a hug.",5,"Heartfelt, Heartbreaking.

550818,A2SETXU4UY67C9,B00004TJTQ,"Ms Diva ""cycworker""","[2, 3]","I watched this movie a few weeks ago with a child I was babysitting. She absolutely loves the movie (she owns the video and watches almost daily. It definitely is a good movie for kids who are in the 8-12 range. The teens won't likely like it, as the movie is slow, and a bit corny and cliched. It's a very simple story about a lonely boy whose mother gets him a dog, despite the objections of his father. The dog, Skipper becomes his best friend.Some of the bullying in the movie was really realistic. However, the way that the other kids finally accepted him seemed false. It really glossed over the topic of bullying. In fact, the movie had a lot of potential issues in it - racism, bullying, war, to name a few - and all were basically ignored because the movie makers were so determined to make this a &quot;nice&quot; movie. Even the sad ending (which I won't spoil) left you feeling ok. There was a subplot involving a cemetary that really didn't &quot;fit&quot; the movie, either.The acting was the best part of the movie.

I cry enough over my own dogs.  I don't need to subject myself to added pain.  I never could stand to watch ""Lassie"" TV shows even though they had  happy endings, just because the story line would stress me out too much.I made the mistake of watching this movie not too long ago.  It is a wonderful story based on fact.  The first 45 minutes I would recommend to anyone for a pleasant, family movie.  The ending I would not recommend to anyone who is especially sensitive, whether they be child or adult.  I found the ending to be cruel compared to the rest of the story.Yes, I know kids have been growing up for years and leaving childhood pets behind while they go off to school.  Do I have to be subjected to it in a movie?  I had a dog myself from age 10 to 27.  She was 17 when I lost her and the longest I ever left her was 2 months.  I think it is cruel to be tricked into the wrenching emotions of watching an aging dog be left behind by the boy who grew up.  And we are told Willie gets a transatlantic phone call to tell him Skip died.  Thanks.  What a nice ending.  Not.This movie deserves 4-5 stars for being a well-made, quality movie.

The story takes place in a  Mississippi suburb during WW2.  His friendship with his dog teaches him  many things along the way.

Definitly a 5 stars movie.Now for the DVD, overall ratings is good. Picture scores a 5. The colours and outline of picture quality are very good.

One with Frankie Muniz and the animal trainer, the other with director Jay Russell. Both adds to the fun when you watch the movie again. An added plus for this DVD is that it comes in two versions of the movie.

550840,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00004TJTQ,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 7]","In plot, `My Dog Skip' offers a pretty standard-issue `a boy and his dog' tale - but at least it doesn't talk down to its core preteen audience. It also provides a finely textured portrait of its wartime, small town Mississippi setting.Based upon the memoirs of writer Willie Morris, `My Dog Skip' stars the wonderful child actor Frankie Muniz (the delightful star of TV's `Malcolm in the Middle') as a friendless nine-year-old misfit whose mother buys him a puppy for his birthday to help assuage his loneliness. More fond of reading than of football, young Willie becomes the hapless target of the town bullies and Skip provides him with just the right note of friendship to help him through his trying times. The cast of characters also includes Willie's well meaning but overprotective war hero father (sensitively played by Kevin Bacon), his loving and supportive mother (the fine actress Diane Lane), the boy-next-door town hero (Luke Wilson) who turns out to be less than one on the battlefield, and a band of moon shiners who figure into the climactic activities of the film's final half.`My Dog Skip' is less noteworthy for its plotting - which often seems forced, obvious and melodramatic - than for its overall tone of laid back charm. Muniz in particular brings such an aura of subtle naturalism to his role as Willie that we easily overlook the film's overall lack of originality. Actually, the fact that Willie seems like such a likeable regular kind of a kid undercuts the film's credibility a little. We find it hard to believe that he would really be such an outcast from his peers. The writer, Gail Gilchriest, and director, Jay Russell, manage to keep the sentimentality down to a minimum, though the film does get a bit goopy once in a while. The moonshining subplot seems especially weak and unconvincing, a pale but underdeveloped echo of `Huck Finn,' a book Morris obviously worshipped as a child (we see him receiving a hardbound copy of it for his birthday). On the positive side, the filmmakers resist the temptation to gussy up the narrative with either highbrow humanitarian messages (though the narration does become a bit portentous at times) or insulting lowbrow comic slapstick. The issue of race relations is dealt with in somewhat glossy and unrealistic terms, but that is probably the appropriate choice for a film aimed at such a young audience.`My Dog Skip' needs to be viewed on two levels - as a beautifully acted but unsurprising version of a tale adults have seen countless times before - and as a sweet, heartwarming and edifying film for young children who will be able to identify with many of the simple themes found in the narrative. On that level alone, `My Dog Skip' scores high as ideal family viewing.",3,conventional but likeable film,983577600,"03 3, 2001",2001,2751,"['plot', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'pretty', 'standard-issue', 'boy', 'dog', 'tale', 'least', ""n't"", 'talk', 'down', 'core', 'preteen', 'audience', 'also', 'finely', 'textured', 'portrait', 'wartime', 'small', 'town', 'Mississippi', 'setting.Based', 'memoirs', 'writer', 'Willie', 'Morris', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'wonderful', 'child', 'actor', 'Frankie', 'Muniz', 'delightful', 'star', 'TV', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'friendless', 'nine-year-old', 'misfit', 'mother', 'puppy', 'birthday', 'help', 'assuage', 'loneliness', 'More', 'fond', 'reading', 'football', 'young', 'Willie', 'hapless', 'target', 'town', 'bullies', 'Skip', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'friendship', 'help', 'trying', 'times', 'cast', 'characters', 'also', 'Willie', 'well', 'meaning', 'overprotective', 'war', 'hero', 'father', 'sensitively', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'loving', 'supportive', 'mother', 'fine', 'actress', 'Diane', 'Lane', 'boy-next-door', 'town', 'hero', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'less', 'one', 'battlefield', 'band', 'moon', 'shiners', 'who', 'figure', 'climactic', 'activities', 'film', 'final', 'half.', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'less', 'noteworthy', 'plotting', 'often', 'forced', 'obvious', 'melodramatic', 'overall', 'tone', 'laid', 'back', 'charm', 'Muniz', 'particular', 'brings', 'such', 'aura', 'subtle', 'naturalism', 'role', 'Willie', 'easily', 'overlook', 'film', 'overall', 'lack', 'originality', 'Actually', 'fact', 'Willie', 'likeable', 'regular', 'kind', 'kid', 'film', 'credibility', 'little', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'would', 'really', 'be', 'such', 'outcast', 'peers', 'writer', 'Gail', 'Gilchriest', 'director', 'Jay', 'Russell', 'manage', 'keep', 'sentimentality', 'down', 'minimum', 'film', 'get', 'bit', 'goopy', 'once', 'while', 'moonshining', 'subplot', 'especially', 'weak', 'unconvincing', 'pale', 'underdeveloped', 'echo', 'Huck', 'Finn', 'book', 'Morris', 'obviously', 'worshipped', 'child', 'see', 'receiving', 'hardbound', 'copy', 'birthday', 'positive', 'side', 'filmmakers', 'resist', 'temptation', 'gussy', 'up', 'narrative', 'highbrow', 'humanitarian', 'messages', 'narration', 'become', 'bit', 'portentous', 'times', 'insulting', 'lowbrow', 'comic', 'slapstick', 'issue', 'race', 'relations', 'dealt', 'somewhat', 'glossy', 'unrealistic', 'terms', 'probably', 'appropriate', 'choice', 'film', 'aimed', 'young', 'audience.', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'needs', 'be', 'viewed', 'two', 'levels', 'beautifully', 'acted', 'unsurprising', 'version', 'tale', 'adults', 'have', 'seen', 'countless', 'times', 'sweet', 'heartwarming', 'edifying', 'film', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'many', 'simple', 'themes', 'found', 'narrative', 'level', 'alone', 'Dog', 'Skip', 'scores', 'high', 'ideal', 'family', 'viewing']",N/A

If you  have a child who is overly sensitive, you may want until they are a little  older before letting them see this film due to the one scene.Despite  the disturbing scene I mentioned, this is still a feel-good movie,  lump-in-throat not-withstanding.Even the most stony-hearted viewer will  have at least a tear in their eye during some of the scenes.

550854,A4JHEO7H330AF,B00004TJTQ,Tom Brody,"[3, 3]","MY DOG SKIP takes place in Yazoo, Mississippi during World War II.  The characters include a boy, Kevin Bacon (famous movie star) as the boy's father, the boy's mother, Luke Wilson (Reese Witherspoon's lawyer boyfriend in LEGALLY BLONDE), three boys who are bullies, and two moonshiners (the evil element).  One of the moonshiners is Clint Howard (brother of Ronnie Howard --  former boy actor from THE MUSIC MAN and THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW). Also, the characters include Skip (a dog), played by a young dog and an old dog.The story is episodic and has no real plot except for the fact that the story takes place on the stage of life.  If there is any real plot, it is the fact that the boy is initially a sissy and is picked on by a trio of three bullies (a fat boy, a dirty-faced boy, and a blank-expressioned boy).  But the birthday gift of a dog has the effect of making the boy somewhat more popular.  The boy is initiated as a friend with the three bullies.  The intiation takes the form of an evening spent in the town graveyard.  Thereafter, the four boys become friends, and play baseball together.  Eventually, when Skip (the dog) runs away from home, the three bullies (formerly bullies, now friends) help to look for the dog.Skip the dog serves as a common theme for the movie, which helps overcome the fact that the film consists of a bunch of ""situations"" or ""episodes.""  These situations, many of which are bittersweet, include the following:(1)  Kevin Bacon is a sour-pussed father and initially threatens to get rid of the dog, a gift for the boy's birthday.  The father warns that the family should not have a dog, because dogs eventually die and cause grief in children.  But the mom refuses to get rid of the dog, whisks the father's cigar from his mouth, and puts the cigar in her own mouth, in an act of defiance.  The dog is kept in the family.(2)  Two bad men (moonshiners) go about their business by hiding bottles of liquor in a stone building in the town graveyard.  This adds suspense and scariness to the movie.  The bad men are too scary for children of the age of six and below.  But children of seven or above might find them intriguing and not too scary.  Ron Howard's brother Clint is instantly recognizable, because of his ugliness.  Towards the end of the movie, one of the bad men whacks the dog with a shovel.  The dog appears near death.  But with the help of a veterinarian, the dog is revived.(3)  The older boy living next door (Luke Wilson) is initially the town hero, at least among children, because he is good at high school sports.  However, upon joining the war effort, he proves to be a coward on the battlefield in Europe.  When he returns home, the film discloses that he has become an alcoholic.(4)  Skip is a popular dog in the town of Yazoo, and the butcher provides him with scraps of meat, and the townsfolk wave to him as he trots up and down the sidewalks of Yazoo.(5)  The boy tries to enroll Skip as an army dog.  But at the recruiting office, Skip flunks the obedience test.  When asked to sit the dog lies down.  When asked to roll over, the dog chases his own tail.MY DOG SKIP is notable for the intelligent writing of its episodes.  MY DOG SKIP is also to be commended for the skillful acting.  One can easily name a half dozen children's movies that are contrived, stupid, or acted with the subtlety of THE THREE STOOGES.  In contrast, MY DOG SKIP is a welcome breath of thespian fresh air.In passing, I might name another finely acted movie about a child (a little boy) that deals with separation of a boy from his mother, and eventual re-joinder.  This fine movie is: UNDER THE SAME MOON, featuring, Eugenio Derbez, Kate del Castillo, Adrian Alonso, and Maya Zapata.",5,"A gentle, happy, and intelligent movie for the entire family (finally).",1250380800,"08 16, 2009",2009,3732,"['DOG', 'SKIP', 'place', 'Yazoo', 'Mississippi', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'characters', 'include', 'boy', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'famous', 'movie', 'star', 'boy', 'father', 'boy', 'mother', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Reese', 'Witherspoon', 'lawyer', 'boyfriend', 'LEGALLY', 'BLONDE', 'three', 'boys', 'who', 'are', 'bullies', 'two', 'moonshiners', 'evil', 'element', 'One', 'moonshiners', 'Clint', 'Howard', 'brother', 'Ronnie', 'Howard', 'former', 'boy', 'actor', 'THE', 'MUSIC', 'MAN', 'THE', 'ANDY', 'GRIFFITH', 'SHOW', 'Also', 'characters', 'include', 'Skip', 'dog', 'played', 'young', 'dog', 'old', 'dog.The', 'story', 'episodic', 'real', 'plot', 'fact', 'story', 'place', 'stage', 'life', 'real', 'plot', 'fact', 'boy', 'initially', 'sissy', 'picked', 'trio', 'three', 'bullies', 'fat', 'boy', 'dirty-faced', 'boy', 'blank-expressioned', 'boy', 'birthday', 'gift', 'dog', 'effect', 'making', 'boy', 'somewhat', 'more', 'popular', 'boy', 'initiated', 'friend', 'three', 'bullies', 'intiation', 'form', 'evening', 'spent', 'town', 'graveyard', 'Thereafter', 'four', 'become', 'friends', 'play', 'baseball', 'together', 'Eventually', 'when', 'Skip', 'dog', 'away', 'home', 'three', 'bullies', 'formerly', 'bullies', 'now', 'help', 'look', 'dog.Skip', 'dog', 'common', 'theme', 'movie', 'overcome', 'fact', 'film', 'bunch', 'situations', 'episodes', 'situations', 'many', 'are', 'bittersweet', 'include', 'following', '1', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'sour-pussed', 'father', 'initially', 'get', 'rid', 'dog', 'gift', 'boy', 'birthday', 'father', 'family', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'dog', 'dogs', 'eventually', 'die', 'cause', 'grief', 'children', 'mom', 'get', 'rid', 'dog', 'father', 'cigar', 'mouth', 'cigar', 'own', 'mouth', 'act', 'defiance', 'dog', 'kept', 'family', '2', 'Two', 'bad', 'men', 'moonshiners', 'go', 'business', 'hiding', 'bottles', 'liquor', 'stone', 'building', 'town', 'graveyard', 'suspense', 'scariness', 'movie', 'bad', 'men', 'are', 'too', 'scary', 'children', 'age', 'six', 'children', 'seven', 'above', 'might', 'find', 'intriguing', 'not', 'too', 'scary', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'brother', 'Clint', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'ugliness', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'bad', 'men', 'dog', 'shovel', 'dog', 'death', 'help', 'veterinarian', 'dog', 'revived', '3', 'older', 'boy', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'initially', 'town', 'hero', 'least', 'children', 'good', 'high', 'school', 'sports', 'However', 'joining', 'war', 'effort', 'be', 'coward', 'battlefield', 'Europe', 'When', 'home', 'film', 'become', 'alcoholic', '4', 'Skip', 'popular', 'dog', 'town', 'Yazoo', 'butcher', 'scraps', 'meat', 'townsfolk', 'wave', 'sidewalks', 'Yazoo', '5', 'boy', 'enroll', 'Skip', 'army', 'dog', 'recruiting', 'office', 'Skip', 'obedience', 'test', 'When', 'asked', 'sit', 'dog', 'down', 'When', 'asked', 'roll', 'over', 'dog', 'own', 'tail.MY', 'DOG', 'SKIP', 'notable', 'intelligent', 'writing', 'episodes', 'MY', 'DOG', 'SKIP', 'also', 'be', 'commended', 'skillful', 'acting', 'One', 'can', 'easily', 'name', 'half', 'dozen', 'children', 'movies', 'are', 'contrived', 'stupid', 'acted', 'subtlety', 'THE', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'contrast', 'MY', 'DOG', 'SKIP', 'welcome', 'breath', 'thespian', 'fresh', 'air.In', 'passing', 'might', 'name', 'finely', 'acted', 'movie', 'child', 'little', 'boy', 'deals', 'separation', 'boy', 'mother', 'eventual', 're-joinder', 'fine', 'movie', 'SAME', 'MOON', 'featuring', 'Eugenio', 'Derbez', 'Kate', 'del', 'Castillo', 'Adrian', 'Alonso', 'Maya', 'Zapata']",N/A

Not only is it completely delightful for both of us, it paves the way for some truly meaningful discussions.  When we first watched it together, and my son was younger, he simply enjoyed the antics of the boy-and-his-dog relationship; now that he's of the age to start asking tough questions, this movie opened the door to some shared revelations about racism and war, to name a few.  Parents be prepared, you may also need to explain what Moonshiners were (believe me, they're not portrayed in any glamorized fashion--in fact, they're the villains here).  More importantly, be prepared for the ending, at which point, if you have any semblance of a heart, you're probably going to make a blubbering fool of yourself in front of your kid (it gets me every time!).This is one of the few kid movies that doesn't pander to its prime audience.
