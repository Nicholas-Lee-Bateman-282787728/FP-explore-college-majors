978465,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000ERVKMG,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[4, 5]","Don Coscarelli was one of the horror directors invited by Mick Garris to participate and create a full hour episode for the new Showtime horror anthology series, Masters of Horror. Coscarelli accepted and his contribution to the horror anthology series was a telefilm adaptation of Joe R. Lansdale's short story of the same name: ""Incident on and off a Mountain Road."" After watching this Coscarelli installment, I would say that he's succeeded in adapting another one of Lansdale's tales (Bubba Ho-Tep being the other).""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" has the typical backwoods, mutant slasher-killer hunting down your typical babe-in-the-woods female whose only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Right from the beginning Coscarelli's episode already shows that things might be abit different from your typical slasher story with the immediate memory flashback by the female lead (gamely and beautifully played by the cute-as-a-button Bree Turner). The flashbacks happen throughout the film as Ellen (Turner) remembers the things she learned on how to survive when faced by imminent danger in a strange landscape. For some the sudden break from the high-tension of the chase between the killer, aptly named Moonface, and Ellen might be abit jarring, but the flashbacks do help add backstory to what would have been just a run-of-the-mill slasher tale. The backstory pretty much shows the viewer that Ellen is, or was, married to someone named Bruce (played with deadly seriousness by Ethan Embry) whose obsession with all things survivalist pulled Ellen into the lifestyle of learning how to survive. The flashbacks also show how a perfect marriage and partnership slowly turned abusive in more ways than one. This change of pace in the film makes us root for Ellen to survive her encounter with Moonface as we've invested quite abit in her well-being.I won't say that the film has nothing thrilling to it. When the flashbacks end and we're brought back to Ellen and her current situation things pick up once more. Moonface (played by John De Santis) brings to mind past boogeymen like Leatherface, Jason, and your typical inbred, mountain-men like those in forgettable films like Wrong Turn. He's in the story just to act as the immediate focus for Ellen's baptism of fire, so to speak. He's an unknown entity whose only purpose was to terrorize Ellen and all who gets in his way. He's abit like a force of nature that one either accepts and deals with accordingly or get run over if one in its way. Ellen does the latter and to satisfying result. Coscarelli long-time collaborator Angus Scrimm makes an appearance as Buddy, an old man devoid of sanity after being left in Moonface's care for an undetermined lenght of time. His character brings out feelings of pity, detestation and finally acceptance. Ellen's actions towards Buddy in the end of the film shows that she's accepted his role in all that's happened and feels pity and acceptance to treat the old man the only way she could.People always thought Coscarelli was of the gore-type of horror director, but they'd be wrong to assume that. Throughout all the Phantasm films and up to Bubba Ho-Tep, Coscarelli didn't use much gore in his films. He instead relied to feelings of tension and dread followed up by a sudden shocking scene to the system. In this Masters of Horror episode, we get to see Coscarelli dabble in the magic of gore. He doesn't go to the level that Carpenter did in Cigarette Burns, but the scene with Moonface and his industrial drill was very Fulci-esque. Even with his dabbling with gore sequences, Coscarelli errs on the side of less is more. But the gore that we do see was done by none other than the gore-effects masters from KNB EFX.All in all, Coscarelli's ""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" was a fresh new take on an old staple of the horror genre. I would actually label this episode more of a survival story than one of horror, but to each their own. This episode was the second I've seen on dvd and I have to say it's much better than Carpenter's. It bodes well for the rest I've yet to see.",4,Coscarelli takes another Lansdale short story and hits a horror hit,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,4115,"['Don', 'Coscarelli', 'was', 'one', 'horror', 'directors', 'invited', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'participate', 'create', 'full', 'hour', 'episode', 'new', 'Showtime', 'horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'Coscarelli', 'accepted', 'contribution', 'horror', 'anthology', 'series', 'was', 'telefilm', 'adaptation', 'Joe', 'R.', 'Lansdale', 'short', 'story', 'same', 'name', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'watching', 'Coscarelli', 'installment', 'would', 'say', 'succeeded', 'adapting', 'one', 'Lansdale', 'tales', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'being', 'other', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'typical', 'backwoods', 'mutant', 'slasher-killer', 'hunting', 'down', 'typical', 'babe-in-the-woods', 'female', 'only', 'fault', 'was', 'being', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'Right', 'beginning', 'Coscarelli', 'episode', 'already', 'things', 'might', 'be', 'abit', 'different', 'typical', 'slasher', 'story', 'immediate', 'memory', 'flashback', 'female', 'lead', 'gamely', 'beautifully', 'played', 'cute-as-a-button', 'Bree', 'Turner', 'flashbacks', 'happen', 'film', 'Ellen', 'Turner', 'things', 'learned', 'how', 'survive', 'when', 'faced', 'imminent', 'danger', 'strange', 'landscape', 'sudden', 'break', 'high-tension', 'chase', 'killer', 'aptly', 'named', 'Moonface', 'Ellen', 'might', 'be', 'abit', 'jarring', 'flashbacks', 'do', 'help', 'add', 'backstory', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'run-of-the-mill', 'slasher', 'tale', 'backstory', 'pretty', 'much', 'viewer', 'Ellen', 'was', 'married', 'someone', 'named', 'Bruce', 'played', 'deadly', 'seriousness', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'obsession', 'things', 'survivalist', 'pulled', 'Ellen', 'lifestyle', 'learning', 'how', 'survive', 'flashbacks', 'also', 'show', 'how', 'perfect', 'marriage', 'partnership', 'slowly', 'turned', 'abusive', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'change', 'pace', 'film', 'root', 'Ellen', 'survive', 'encounter', 'Moonface', ""'ve"", 'invested', 'quite', 'abit', 'well-being.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'nothing', 'thrilling', 'When', 'flashbacks', 'end', ""'re"", 'brought', 'back', 'Ellen', 'current', 'situation', 'things', 'pick', 'up', 'once', 'more', 'Moonface', 'played', 'John', 'De', 'Santis', 'mind', 'past', 'boogeymen', 'Leatherface', 'Jason', 'typical', 'inbred', 'mountain-men', 'forgettable', 'films', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'story', 'just', 'act', 'immediate', 'focus', 'Ellen', 'baptism', 'fire', 'so', 'speak', 'unknown', 'entity', 'only', 'purpose', 'was', 'terrorize', 'Ellen', 'who', 'way', 'abit', 'force', 'nature', 'one', 'accepts', 'deals', 'accordingly', 'get', 'run', 'one', 'way', 'Ellen', 'latter', 'satisfying', 'result', 'Coscarelli', 'long-time', 'collaborator', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'appearance', 'Buddy', 'old', 'man', 'devoid', 'sanity', 'being', 'left', 'Moonface', 'care', 'undetermined', 'lenght', 'time', 'character', 'out', 'feelings', 'pity', 'detestation', 'finally', 'acceptance', 'Ellen', 'actions', 'towards', 'Buddy', 'end', 'film', 'accepted', 'role', 'happened', 'feels', 'pity', 'acceptance', 'treat', 'old', 'man', 'only', 'way', 'could.People', 'always', 'thought', 'Coscarelli', 'was', 'gore-type', 'horror', 'director', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'assume', 'Phantasm', 'films', 'up', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'Coscarelli', 'did', ""n't"", 'use', 'much', 'gore', 'films', 'instead', 'relied', 'feelings', 'tension', 'dread', 'followed', 'up', 'sudden', 'shocking', 'scene', 'system', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'episode', 'get', 'see', 'Coscarelli', 'dabble', 'magic', 'gore', ""n't"", 'go', 'level', 'Carpenter', 'did', 'Cigarette', 'Burns', 'scene', 'Moonface', 'industrial', 'drill', 'was', 'very', 'Fulci-esque', 'Even', 'dabbling', 'gore', 'sequences', 'Coscarelli', 'side', 'less', 'more', 'gore', 'do', 'see', 'was', 'done', 'none', 'other', 'gore-effects', 'masters', 'KNB', 'EFX.All', 'Coscarelli', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'was', 'fresh', 'new', 'take', 'old', 'staple', 'horror', 'genre', 'would', 'actually', 'label', 'episode', 'more', 'survival', 'story', 'one', 'horror', 'own', 'episode', 'was', 'second', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'dvd', 'have', 'say', 'much', 'better', 'Carpenter', 'well', 'rest', ""'ve"", 'yet', 'see']",Masters of Horror - Don Coscarelli - Incident on and off a Mountain Road

Etnyre ""roguemissive""","[3, 4]","With few exceptions, (CIGARETTE BURNS) I think we may all be coming to realize that this series and its vignettes are by in large disappointments.  Horror fans do have high expectations, and perhaps the bar keeps getting raised in what may be unrealistically large increments.  But also, these stories are not that clever, and the execution isn't generally very scary or original.As for this episode, I am a BIG fan of Don Coscarelli, and perhaps that may be a factor that resulted in impractically high expectations.  This film definitely wasn't the worst of the bunch (HOMECOMING, CHOCOLATE).  It wasn't terrible, or even all that bad.  It was competently made, with a creepy and disturbing atmosphere, which is what the director was trying for, and did generate some chilling moments.  But it wasn't all that great either.  I don't even know if I can say it was very good.  Even an actor whom I am a fan of (Angus Scrimm) portrayed a character so poorly written for, that it was difficult to tell if he was supposed to be funny or not.  It was a wasted appearance of a fine actor (and very nice guy in real life).The bottom line is, the rating system we get doesn't examine complex criteria that goes into film-making, nor other objective measures of quality.  Simply put, it is based on whether you love or like or dislike or hate a film.  In the end, I just didn't like this all that much - not enough for a 3-star anyways.

978473,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000ERVKMG,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 1]","Showtime's Masters of Horror anthology series got off to one hell of a good start with Incident on and off a Mountain Road.  The brainchild of Mick Garris, the Masters of Horror series essentially gave one famed horror director after another the chance to make and direct a one hour film of their choosing.  Given such free reign over the production, each director was limited by little more than his imagination - and, as you would expect, this proved to be a strong formula for great horror.  Don Coscarelli ofPhantasmfame apparently drew the first straw and got to go first - and he set the bar high.  Teaming up with Joe R. Lansdale, who wrote the short story this film is based on, Coscarelli even brings Phantasm's Angus Scrimm along for what proves to be a glorious joyride into the dark side of human nature.After crashing into a seemingly abandoned car on an otherwise deserted mountain road, Ellen (the drop-dead gorgeous Bree Turner) searches for another possible accident victim.  Following a trail of blood, she finds the other car's driver being dragged along by some kind of human monster.  All too soon, Ellen finds herself on the run from ""Moonface"" (John DeSantis) through the forest.  I know what you're thinking: here we go again with the same old ""monster chases girl through the woods"" plot we've seen time and time again.  I'll grant you that this has all the earmarks of a complete mismatch, but Ellen has a few tricks up her dainty little sleeve.  As a series of flashbacks begin to show us, Ellen is in a relationship with a ""survivalist"" (Ethan Embry) who has taught her quite a bit about surviving against all odds.  Of course, Ellen's little surprises for Moonface don't always work out the way she wanted - and that makes for some really great moments.Apart from the flashbacks - which are necessary for the story to unfold as effectively as it does - this is a tightly-wound, taut thriller with a few weirdly comedic moments supplied by Angus Scrimm.  As much as I liked the story and the direction, though, I have to say that Bree Turner pretty much makes the film such a treat to watch.  She's hot, obviously, but she's also quite a very good actress - sort of a younger version of Jennifer Love Hewitt, in my eyes.  I really want to see more of her in the horror genre.  The film isn't perfect, though.  For one thing, it's very difficult to see what Ellen ever saw in her man Bruce, who even spent their first date carrying on about how horrible the world is.  I also have to admit that I had trouble making Ethan Embry fit the role of a big and tough survival enthusiast, as he's still the excitable kid from Can't Hardly Wait to me.I have to put any of my small quibbles aside, though, because Incident on and off a Mountain Road does what it does exceedingly well - and it does it with a rare mixture of gore and subtlety.  (I kid you not - there is bona fide nuance in this little masterpiece.)

978474,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,B000ERVKMG,David Bonesteel,"[3, 4]","This is my third episode of the ""Masters of Horror"" series and, so far, I am seriously underwhelmed.  In this one, a young woman (Bree Turner) is stranded in the woods after a car accident, only to be pursued by a hulking mountain maniac called Moonface (John De Santis).  Unfortunately for him, she was once involved in a thoroughly unconvincing relationship with a survivalist gun nut (Ethan Embry).  (When he says, on their first date, something like: ""Sometimes I just want to get rid of all the idiots,"" she says, with a dreamy expression on her face: ""You want to get out of here?"")  She sets little traps for Moonface in the woods and, naturally, he blunders right into them (with, I admit, one rather gory exception).  Although many reviewers cite this as a welcome bit of originality in the woman-in-peril scenario, I felt that I had seen this type of thing many times before.  The ""Rambo"" movies come to mind.  The fact that a woman is setting the snares this time didn't make it feel particularly fresh to me.  The conclusion involves a sudden, drastic change in character on the part of our heroine that I just didn't believe.

Let me break down the ratings for the episodes as follows:Chocolate - The worst of the bunch, easily. *Cigarette Burns - The best of the bunch, easily. *****Dance of the Dead - Pretty boring and instantly forgettable. **Deep Woman - Entertaining, but nothing special. ***Dreams in the Witch House - Pretty good Lovecraft adaptation. ****Fair Haired Child - Good, if somewhat disjointed. ***Haeckel's Tale - Could have been so much more. ***Homecoming - Almost the worst of the bunch. *Imprint - Not as graphic as they made it out to be, good, but not great. ***Incident On and Off a Mountain Road - Fun, but comes up a bit short. ***Jenifer - Nice addition from the Italian master. ****Pick Me Up - Dueling serial killers, a fun story. ***Sick Girl - Pretty weird, but it is Lucky McKee, and it's excellent. ****So all in all it was a slightly above average season, and now it is packed into one box for ease. Maybe I was expecting a bit too much out of this, but given the varied directors, styles and skills, I knew I couldn't expect perfection.

She notices another empty car nearby and decides to look for someone who can help her. She is greeted by a bloodied victim, still alive and her remarkably large predator. His name is Moonface (John De Santis). He is severely deformed, about 8 feet tall and armed with several sharp objects and not to mention possesses impressive acrobatic skills (His entrance on screen, when he leaps to view, is quite remarkable and frightening at the same time). Ellen does what anyone in fear of their life would have done, and scrambles to the woods hoping to lose this violent maniac, that is of course, until she decides not to be a victim any longer. Through several flashbacks, we find out Ellen is no weakling, she was trained by an obnoxious but shrewd soldier ex-husband (Ethan Embry) to ""expect the unexpected"" and ""do the unexpected"". He was able to teach her several survival techniques and through his teachings, Ellen is able to construct, using a limited time-frame (and suspension of disbelief) several booby traps in order to hurt or handicap the predator.This gem in the ""Masters of Horror"" series was directed by Don Coscarelli (""Phantasm"") and is one of the best offerings of Season 1. How can a horror tale be so predictable and yet so unpredictable? The story is clich&eacute;d but several twists are thrown in to make the viewer say ""what the heck?"". To begin with, this isn't your typical damsel in distress. Our heroine (if you want to call her that) is a tough as nails, steely-faced babe with the heart and soul of a survivor. Yes, there are moments of her crying and screaming, as anyone in her situation would be but after taking her training into consideration, she is able to rise above it all and give this monstrous villain a run for his money. You almost feel sorry for him and speaking of Moonface, is he really just a senseless killer or does he have a purpose? This film will have you questioning who the real villian is.Another outstanding aspect of this episode is its dark, sinister tone. The ambiance alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Aside from a few flashback scenes, there is nothing but darkness on screen lightened only by the moon above and even more disturbing are the human scarecrows, artfully arranged in this maniac's back yard, with their eyes removed and rays of moonlight streaming through their gaping eye sockets. Very effectively done. I thoroughly enjoyed most episodes from the MOH series but there are a few that were technically well made and hold up to repeated viewings, this is one of them. It takes a ""been there done that"" type of scenario and injects new life into it by giving us another type of heroine who is typically tough, gorgeous but not vulnerable and definitely not an idiot, and another type of villain (or should I say villains?). Add in the gore, atmosphere, good performances, a few twists here and there and you've got yourself a solid horror tale that is original despite being very familiar territory.

Luckily she survives but not for long as a ugly and crazy hillbilly named Moonface (John de Santis) goes after her as she discovers a horrifying secret about this cretin for now she must fight for her life.Co-starring Ethan Embry and Angus Scrimm (The Tallman from ""Phantasm"" fame), this MOH story is directed by Don Coscralli (""Phantasm Series"", ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" and ""Beastmaster""). This is one of the most intense and bloodiest of the MOH tales, inspired by the 70's and 80's killer hillbilly movies like ""Mother's Day"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and even ""The Hills Have Eyes"" this is a gripping story of survival. The story is quite good while the acting is alright but Scrimm does a great peformance here as one of Moonfaces's victims, the cretin in this movie is an interesting and scary backwoods killer whom is very much like a modern Leatherface. There is some gory sequences like how Moonface makes his scarecrows out of human beings and of course a bizarre twist in the end makes this a great tale.This DVD contains cool extras like featurettes, audio commentary, interviews, still galleries, bio, DVD-rom extras and Trailers to other Anchor Bay releases.Also recommended: ""The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)"", ""Wrong Turn 1 & 2"", ""Last House on The Left"", ""Jeepers Creepers"", ""Pumpkinhead"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Grindhouse"", ""Just Before Dawn"", ""Mother's Day"", ""I Spit on Your Grave"", ""Hostel 1 & 2"", ""Maniac (1980)"", ""The Burning"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series including 2003 remake and The Beginning"".",5,Fantastic grueling story!,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,1649,"['woman', 'named', 'Ellen', 'Bree', 'Turner', 'was', 'driving', 'one', 'night', 'down', 'road', 'mountain', 'car', 'accident', 'Luckily', 'not', 'long', 'ugly', 'crazy', 'hillbilly', 'named', 'Moonface', 'John', 'de', 'Santis', 'horrifying', 'secret', 'cretin', 'now', 'must', 'fight', 'life.Co-starring', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'Tallman', 'Phantasm', 'fame', 'MOH', 'story', 'directed', 'Don', 'Coscralli', 'Phantasm', 'Series', 'Bubba', 'Ho-Tep', 'Beastmaster', 'one', 'most', 'intense', 'bloodiest', 'MOH', 'tales', 'inspired', '70', '80', 'killer', 'hillbilly', 'movies', 'Mother', 'Day', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'even', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'gripping', 'story', 'survival', 'story', 'quite', 'good', 'acting', 'alright', 'Scrimm', 'great', 'peformance', 'here', 'one', 'Moonfaces', 'victims', 'cretin', 'movie', 'interesting', 'scary', 'backwoods', 'killer', 'whom', 'very', 'much', 'modern', 'Leatherface', 'gory', 'sequences', 'how', 'Moonface', 'scarecrows', 'human', 'beings', 'course', 'bizarre', 'twist', 'end', 'great', 'tale.This', 'DVD', 'cool', 'extras', 'featurettes', 'audio', 'commentary', 'interviews', 'still', 'galleries', 'bio', 'DVD-rom', 'extras', 'Trailers', 'other', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'releases.Also', 'recommended', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', '1977', '2006', 'Wrong', 'Turn', '1', '2', 'Last', 'House', 'Left', 'Jeepers', 'Creepers', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Dusk', 'Till', 'Dawn', 'Grindhouse', 'Just', 'Dawn', 'Mother', 'Day', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', 'Hostel', '1', '2', 'Maniac', '1980', 'Burning', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'series', 'including', '2003', 'remake', 'Beginning']",Masters of Horror - Don Coscarelli - Incident on and off a Mountain Road

Menta, Jr.","[13, 14]","Of the four ""Masters of Horror"" DVDs I've seen so far, ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road is easily the best, blowing past Mick Garris' entry and narrowly edging out John Carpenter's and Stuart Gordon's stories.  First, ""Incident"" skillfully delivers the kind of expected thrills one looks for in a horror film (in this case, we get a monstrous killing machine chasing a young woman through the woods) but then throws in, equally skillfully, a few ""all is not as it seems"" elements and some welcome depth, subtlety, and complexity in the characterizations.  It all adds up to a great hour or so of gritty entertainment.The extras in this DVD series continue to be top notch.  Contrary to Amazon's description, ""Incident"" actually includes TWO commentaries, one by director/writer Don Coscarelli and co-writer Stephen Romano and one by Mr. Coscarelli and Joe R. Lansdale, who wrote the original short story that was adapted into the ""Incident"" film.  In fact, listening to how much Mr. Coscarelli and Mr. Romano regard Joe Lansdale's stories on the first commentary track and then hearing from the fascinating Mr. Lansdale himself on the second commentary track made me go to the book section of Amazon to order a paperback copy of ""High Cotton: Selected Short Stories of Joe R. Lansdale"".  The book contains the original 16-page short story ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" (which for years Mr. Coscarelli wanted to adapt) and several other stories.  I'm really looking forward to getting it.By the way, that's the other great thing about these ""Masters of Horror"" DVDs: they constantly talk up, and make you want to seek out, other films by the featured creator or ""Master of Horror"" in question, and they also make sure to tell you about the literary sources (H.P. Lovecraft, Joe R. Lansdale, etc.) of some of these short films, in the event you want to check out the original stories.In any event, if you haven't checked out one of these ""Masters of Horror"" DVDs yet, you can't go wrong with this one.

978493,A28GCEHD00JFZG,B000ERVKMG,Julian Kennedy,"[0, 0]","Masters of Horror: Don Coscarelli: Incident On and Off a Mountain Road: 8 out of 10: In many ways fifty minutes is the perfect length for a horror movie. Incident certainly has enough plot for a full length feature, but this is a story broken down to its core elements without any unnecessary filler. (It has a bit of a Twilight Zone feel as a result.)Masters of Horror is that wonderful Showtime series that has produced some great horror films and some guilty pleasures (in particular Clive Barker's Haeckel's Tale). Incident got this anthology series off to a very strong start.The film is about a woman that has a car accident on a deserted stretch of rain soaked mountain road. She quickly finds herself perused by a serial killer (dubbed Moonface) who is busy chasing a previous victim. She turns out not to be the damsel in distress that we suspected, as she has had survival training from her boyfriend which the film doles out in flashback. It is also interesting as one can see the progression of her relationship with the boyfriend as it coincides her conflict with Moonface.Director Don Coscarielli runs a tight ship with plenty of surprises in both plot and scope. The acting by all is above board with a particular nod to John DeSantis as the serial killer. Moonface, with his chrome teeth, baldhead and big shiny knife; he is such a quality villain that it seems a shame he is in such a small film. Moonface certainly could hold his own with the Jason's and Leatherface's of the world. In fact, he has that childlike quality that made Leatherface such an endearing character,. (Not to mention they share the same interior decorator.)The gore is good, the set design is excellent and the movie is simply never boring.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","Having viewed the entire ""Masters of Horror"" series, I was curious to see this episode that was ""Banned From Cable Broadcast."" It seems pretty silly in this day and age that something is ""banned"" from pay TV, and it's not as if Takeshi Miike doesn't have his films shown over here! But, OK, whatever. Miike is a colorful director who specialize in squeamish, sometimes graphic, torture horror. Probably his biggest film stateside is ""Audition"" which is certainly noteworthy, but my personal favorite is the bizarre musical ""Happiness of the Katakuris"" (currently out of print, but worth locating if you like absurd comedy).So on to ""Imprint."" I'm pleased to say that ""Imprint"" is actually one of the stronger entries in the series. And seeing how dismal the first couple of episodes in season 2 are (it is currently broadcasting), I'm disappointed this wasn't made available. As the story begins, we're traveling down a river of death to an island of demons and prostitutes--and I was scared this episode would rapidly devolve into supernatural mumbo jumbo. It settles, however, into a two character drama with one of the disfigured prostitutes relating the story of the visitor's lost love. It's a fascinating tale that continues to evolve the more the guest presses for the truth. And the revelations are satisfying, if bizarre. I enjoyed this lurid tale very much.Along the way, we get torture and plenty of abortions--and I suppose that is the controversial nature of this film (the abortions, I mean--violence is never controversial). No one, however, watching ""Masters of Horror"" would be the least bit put out by these scenes. If you are expecting something you've never seen before--there's nothing in ""Imprint"" that going to particularly shock you. But that said, it is definitely an accomplished and disturbing tale worth taking a look at.

978499,A2ODFNHZF5I7R1,B000ERVKMG,"Luke ""When hello ended, you let me go...""","[10, 14]","My experience with Masters of Horror started with Dario Argento's Jenifer. That movie was so screwed up that it actually disturbed me- not an easy feat. But after seeing Jenifer, I knew I had to have more. So as the DVD's started coming out I started renting or buying them, and had enjoyed all the ones I'd seen. Before I got the box set, I had seen Cigarette Burns, Dreams In The Witch House, The Fair Haired Child, and Jenifer, and was extremely impressed with them all. I'm not going to start complaining about how this box set should have been released initially, because everyone knew a box set would come out eventually- you just had to be patient. Anyways, here's my scores for the films.1.1 Incident On And Off A Mountain Road (Don Coscarelli)- 3.5/5 This one was entertaining, and had a great cast. The main villain was rather creepy, too. I just thought the final confrontation felt rushed. This one definately needed more time.1.2 Dreams in the Witch House (Stuart Gordon) 4/5 This one was great. I'm an H.P. Lovecraft fan, so that gave it props for me before I even saw the episode. It was genuinely creepy.1.3 Dance of the Dead (Tobe Hooper) 3.5/5 I thought this was pretty good. The character development was exceptional, and the final twist, while not entirely unexpected, was very appropriate for the story. Plus, it had Robert Englund.1.4 Jenifer (Dario Argento) 3.5/5 This episode freaked me out when I first saw it. I loved the gore, but I couldn't help but question the detective's choices regarding Jenifer.1.5 Chocolate (Mick Garris) 3/5 This was decent. It had some really good moments, and I'd watch it again, but it definately wasn't my favorite.1.6 Homecoming (Joe Dante) 0/5 This episode was absolute garbage. Zombies coming back to vote? Were they high? This was just stupid. I had to FORCE myself to sit through the whole episode, thinking there may be some gore or something. There wasn't. This episode was just plain boring.1.7 Deer Woman (John Landis) 4.5/5 This episode was hilarious. I loved this one, and I'm not usually a fan of John Landis's work, but this one was great.1.8 Cigarette Burns (John Carpenter) 5/5 Absolutely perfect episode. Loved John's direction, plus it had Norman Reedus and lots of gore. Perfect.1.9 The Fair Haired Child (William Mallone) 4/5 I really enjoyed this one. The lead actress was very good looking, the monster was creepy, and the gore was adequate.1.10 Sick Girl (Lucky McKee) 3.5/5 Another one of those funny episodes. I enjoyed this one too, and thought both lead female characters were hilarious.1.11 Pick Me Up (Larry Cohen) 3/5 This was pretty good. Both serial killers were rather likable. I just felt it was missing a little something, I don't know what.1.12 Haeckel's Tale (Roger Corman) 3.5/5 Another good episode, based on Clive Barker's short story (which was why I was so excited to watch it). Great gore, great acting, perfectly morbid conclusion.1.13 Imprint (Takashi Miike) 4/5 This one was genuinely disturbing. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. AT ALL. Great direction, wonderful sets, great characters. Very good episode.The only reason I give this box set a 4 out of 5 is because of Homecoming. That episode was so bad it brought down the overall value of the box set, I thought.",4,Great with the exception of one episode...,1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,3263,"['experience', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'started', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Jenifer', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'screwed', 'up', 'actually', 'disturbed', 'me-', 'not', 'easy', 'feat', 'seeing', 'Jenifer', 'knew', 'had', 'have', 'more', 'So', 'DVD', 'started', 'coming', 'out', 'started', 'renting', 'buying', 'had', 'enjoyed', 'ones', ""'d"", 'seen', 'got', 'box', 'set', 'had', 'seen', 'Cigarette', 'Burns', 'Dreams', 'Witch', 'House', 'Fair', 'Haired', 'Child', 'Jenifer', 'was', 'extremely', 'impressed', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'start', 'complaining', 'how', 'box', 'set', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'initially', 'everyone', 'knew', 'box', 'set', 'would', 'come', 'out', 'eventually-', 'just', 'had', 'be', 'patient', 'Anyways', 'here', 'scores', 'films.1.1', 'Incident', 'A', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', '3.5/5', 'one', 'was', 'entertaining', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'main', 'villain', 'was', 'rather', 'creepy', 'too', 'just', 'thought', 'final', 'confrontation', 'felt', 'rushed', 'one', 'definately', 'needed', 'more', 'time.1.2', 'Dreams', 'Witch', 'House', 'Stuart', 'Gordon', '4/5', 'one', 'was', 'great', ""'m"", 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'fan', 'gave', 'even', 'saw', 'episode', 'was', 'genuinely', 'creepy.1.3', 'Dance', 'Dead', 'Tobe', 'Hooper', '3.5/5', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'exceptional', 'final', 'twist', 'not', 'entirely', 'unexpected', 'was', 'very', 'appropriate', 'story', 'had', 'Robert', 'Englund.1.4', 'Jenifer', 'Dario', 'Argento', '3.5/5', 'episode', 'freaked', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'loved', 'gore', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'question', 'detective', 'choices', 'regarding', 'Jenifer.1.5', 'Chocolate', 'Mick', 'Garris', '3/5', 'was', 'decent', 'had', 'really', 'good', 'moments', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'definately', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite.1.6', 'Homecoming', 'Joe', 'Dante', '0/5', 'episode', 'was', 'absolute', 'garbage', 'Zombies', 'coming', 'back', 'vote', 'Were', 'high', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'had', 'FORCE', 'sit', 'whole', 'episode', 'thinking', 'may', 'be', 'gore', 'something', 'was', ""n't"", 'episode', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'boring.1.7', 'Deer', 'Woman', 'John', 'Landis', '4.5/5', 'episode', 'was', 'hilarious', 'loved', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'fan', 'John', 'Landis', 'work', 'one', 'was', 'great.1.8', 'Cigarette', 'Burns', 'John', 'Carpenter', '5/5', 'Absolutely', 'perfect', 'episode', 'Loved', 'John', 'direction', 'had', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'lots', 'gore', 'Perfect.1.9', 'Fair', 'Haired', 'Child', 'William', 'Mallone', '4/5', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'lead', 'actress', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'looking', 'monster', 'was', 'creepy', 'gore', 'was', 'adequate.1.10', 'Sick', 'Girl', 'Lucky', 'McKee', '3.5/5', 'one', 'funny', 'episodes', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'too', 'thought', 'lead', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'hilarious.1.11', 'Pick', 'Me', 'Up', 'Larry', 'Cohen', '3/5', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'serial', 'killers', 'were', 'rather', 'likable', 'just', 'felt', 'was', 'missing', 'little', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what.1.12', 'Haeckel', 'Tale', 'Roger', 'Corman', '3.5/5', 'good', 'episode', 'based', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'short', 'story', 'was', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'watch', 'Great', 'gore', 'great', 'acting', 'perfectly', 'morbid', 'conclusion.1.13', 'Imprint', 'Takashi', 'Miike', '4/5', 'one', 'was', 'genuinely', 'disturbing', 'NOT', 'THE', 'FAINT', 'OF', 'HEART', 'AT', 'ALL', 'Great', 'direction', 'wonderful', 'sets', 'great', 'characters', 'Very', 'good', 'episode.The', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'box', 'set', '4', '5', 'Homecoming', 'episode', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'brought', 'down', 'overall', 'value', 'box', 'set', 'thought']",Masters of Horror - Don Coscarelli - Incident on and off a Mountain Road

She takes the helm here as Ellen, a woman who wrecks her car late at night while driving through the mountains.  Her problems, of course, turn out to be larger than a dented fender.  Namely, she must square off with Moonface, a creature who is far deadlier than his name implies.Ellen, refreshingly, is not your typical horror movie Damsel In Distress.  She proves herself to be a worthy (and entertaining) foe to the disturbing creature who stalks her through the rocky woods, a pleasant change of pace from the women who stumble on broken heels, make ludicrous decisions, and prefer screaming to thinking.In a series of well-placed flashbacks, Coscarelli gives us glimpses of her education in survival, taking place at the hands of her too-eager boyfriend/husband, Bruce.  Played by Ethan Embry (who hasn't made much of himself since his ""Can't Hardly Wait"" days), Bruce is a convincing character, but it's hard to imagine how his slightly off-putting insistence managed to snag a smart and capable lady like Ellen.No matter.  Coscarelli leaves explanations aside, avoiding unnecessary details.  What's really important is the tooth-and-nail present.  Coscarelli uses standard horror film elements to mold together something decidedly unique and satisfying.  It's not particularly ground-breaking, nor is it without its flaws (the flashbacks, while important, sap the story of some of its tension), but it is a comforting bit of entertainment, especially for Fright Fans who are afraid that the genre is in danger of dying a slow and boring death.",4,A Killing Education,1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,1935,"['Directed', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'man', 'responsible', 'gut-wrenching', 'Phantasm', 'films', 'brilliantly', 'quirky', 'Bubba', 'Ho-tep', 'Incident', 'was', 'fine', 'start', 'Showtime', 'promising', 'spotty', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series.The', 'beautiful', 'Bree', 'Turner', 'spent', 'most', 'career', 'playing', 'snobby', 'sorority', 'girls', 'providing', 'attractive', 'scenery', 'relatively', 'benign', 'movies', 'T.V', 'shows', 'helm', 'here', 'Ellen', 'woman', 'who', 'car', 'late', 'night', 'driving', 'mountains', 'problems', 'course', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'larger', 'dented', 'fender', 'Namely', 'must', 'square', 'off', 'Moonface', 'creature', 'who', 'far', 'deadlier', 'name', 'implies.Ellen', 'refreshingly', 'not', 'typical', 'horror', 'movie', 'Damsel', 'Distress', 'be', 'worthy', 'entertaining', 'foe', 'disturbing', 'creature', 'who', 'rocky', 'woods', 'pleasant', 'change', 'pace', 'women', 'who', 'stumble', 'broken', 'heels', 'make', 'ludicrous', 'decisions', 'prefer', 'screaming', 'thinking.In', 'series', 'well-placed', 'flashbacks', 'Coscarelli', 'glimpses', 'education', 'survival', 'taking', 'place', 'hands', 'too-eager', 'boyfriend/husband', 'Bruce', 'Played', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'who', ""n't"", 'made', 'much', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Hardly', 'Wait', 'days', 'Bruce', 'convincing', 'character', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'slightly', 'off-putting', 'insistence', 'managed', 'snag', 'smart', 'capable', 'lady', 'Ellen.No', 'matter', 'Coscarelli', 'explanations', 'aside', 'avoiding', 'unnecessary', 'details', 'What', 'really', 'important', 'tooth-and-nail', 'present', 'Coscarelli', 'standard', 'horror', 'film', 'elements', 'mold', 'together', 'something', 'decidedly', 'unique', 'satisfying', 'not', 'particularly', 'ground-breaking', 'flaws', 'flashbacks', 'important', 'sap', 'story', 'tension', 'comforting', 'bit', 'entertainment', 'especially', 'Fright', 'Fans', 'who', 'are', 'afraid', 'genre', 'danger', 'dying', 'slow', 'boring', 'death']",Masters of Horror - Don Coscarelli - Incident on and off a Mountain Road

The only loss here is the cover artwork, but as a collector short of space this compact box-set suits me fine. Looking forward to the eventual second season box-set. With so many special edition horror DVDs packaged in a coffin shaped box, I have at least six, it is refreshing to finally get an actual tomb !I'm very much enjoying watching the episodes, being able to watch them as and when I like is a joy as I've never seen any of them prior to this set, so this is all fresh for me.

978503,A3G602Z4DWDZKS,B000ERVKMG,Matthew King,"[23, 24]","John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli, Takashi Miike. These are but some of the powerhouse names in horror that were enlisted to direct episodes of ""Masters of Horror"", a 13-episode series that debuted last fall on the Showtime network. Comparisons to other TV horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone and Friday the 13th were inevitably made but ""Masters"" decidedly differs from those in several aspects as there is no host, no commercials and little trace of humor/camp. No, Masters of Horror is a no-holds barred hardcore horror anthology that gives full creative freedom to its directors, many of them names that have been known to not pull any punches whatsoever.What I particularly like about the show is that there is no guiding voice, or TV producer, telling the director how things should be. Each episode has the director's own personal stamp on it, to give us the feeling that ""This is not a masters of horror episode, it's a Dario Argento movie, or a Takashi Miike movie, etc."" The result of this creative freedom and unique concept is an anthology where every episode feels uniquely distinct from one another.The third episode of Masters to be released on DVD is ""Incident on and off a mountain road"", directed by Don Coscarelli.  Coscarelli has become a cult name in horror almost exclusively based on the success of his ""Phantasm"" series that consists of the original 1979 classic and its three decent sequels.  Outside of Phantasm he hadn't made much worth mentioning until, that is, in 2002 with the release of Bubba Ho-tep, a wacky uncategorizable film based on a Joe R. Lansdale short story.  So successful was Bubba Ho-tep that a sequel (with Lansdale again in the writing chair) is currently in production and Coscarelli has directed this episode of Masters that is also based on a Lansdale short out of the author's ""High Cotton"" anthology.  After being known almost exclusively for the Phantasm movies, Coscarelli's adaptations of Lansdale stories has breathed new life into his career.Story:  A woman driving alone on an isolated stretch of a mountainous road crashes her car while taking her eyes off the road to switch radio stations.  Things go from bad to worse when she ends up being chased around by a mutant-faced maniac (""Moonface"") wielding a huge knife.  While being chased by Moonface, we see flashbacks of the woman's near-past relationship with an ex-boyfriend, a soldier who would teach her survival techniques.  The woman is able to use the survival techniques learned from the boyfriend to set up booby traps and clever escape routes to elude Moonface, who perhaps got a little more than he bargained for with this would-be victim.This is only my third Masters episode that I've watched (the other two being Cigarette Burns and Dreams in the Witch House) and it's definitely the best so far.  In fact, I'd be very surprised if any subsequent episode of Masters that I watch would be as good as this one.  Simply put, it is a classic.  While other episodes of Masters seem to go for the ""weird"" factor in horror with different degrees of pacing, this one goes for the throat with a non-stop unrelenting pace.  This is fast-paced suspense on a par with Dean Koontz novels, thrown in with horrific macabre touches based around the lair of Moonface, who is truly evil incarnate.  The flashbacks work surprisingly well and do little to slow the pace.  The locales are absolutely stunning, as the chase leads us through forests and creeks under the moonlit night.  Filmed near Vancouver, those familiar with the area will get a kick out of the scene filmed on the Capilano suspension bridge.  All this plus a very neat twist at the end make this a truly memorable episode.  Someone should look into licensing ALL the stories from High Cotton for Coscarelli to adapt.

978505,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B000ERVKMG,Michael R Gates,"[43, 46]","Although it was the first episode of MASTERS OF HORROR to air on Showtime when the series debuted in October 2005, director Don Coscarelli's ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" is the fourth series segment to be released on DVD.  And it is also one of the best of the series thus far (series one has ended, but the show is expected to continue for at least one more season).  Longtime genre fans will recognize the name Coscarelli, of course, as he is the writer/director of the classic horror flick PHANTASM (1979) and its sequels, director and co-writer of the sword-and-sorcery fantasy THE BEASTMASTER (1982), and the writer/director of the more contemporary horror-comedy cult favorite BUBBA HO-TEP (2002).An adaptation of the short story by genre author Joe R. Lansdale--who also wrote the story on which BUBBA HO-TEP was based--""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" is an interesting, fresh take on the girl-chased-through-the-woods slasher-type flick, one with a very wry twist at the end. It stars cute actress Bree Turner (some genre fans my recognize her from 2005's JEKYLL + HYDE) as Ellen, a young woman who has an auto accident late one night while driving through the rural mountains of Oregon.  After crawling from the wreckage and trying to assess the damage, Ellen quickly finds herself pursued by a hulking mountain-dwelling madman (John De Santis, familiar to horror fans from his role as Lurch in the short-lived  late-1990s TV series THE NEW ADDAMS FAMILY).  But Ellen is no ordinary damsel in distress.  Through occasional flashbacks, it is revealed that her ex-husband was an obsessive survivalist and that he forced her to participate in his training sessions.  And as a result, Ellen has a few tricks up her sleeve that just may help her outwit her brutish pursuer and survive the night.As is, Lansdale's original story rises way above the cliche of its slasher roots, but the script by Coscarelli and his co-writer, Stephen Romano, ratchet it up even higher by adding some elements only hinted at by Lansdale.  This enables Coscarelli, as director, to create a 60-minute visual ride that is dense with layers of thrills, suspense, and shocks that lesser directors would have trouble fitting into a two-hour flick.  Of course, he is helped by the outstanding acting abilities of Turner, whose talent allows her to convincingly vacillate between vulnerability and strength, as well as the intense performance from Ethan Embry (who plays Ellen's ex-husband in flashback sequences) and the skills and menacing presence of De Santis.  Even Coscarelli's old friend Angus Scrimm--who became a genre icon playing the Tall Man in the classic PHANTASM series--makes a delightfully quirky appearance.The DVD edition of ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" offers a pristine digital transfer of the filmic series episode in anamorphic widescreen at its original aspect ratio of 1.77:1.  And as is almost always the case with discs from the cool folks at Anchor Bay, the DVD is chockful with bonus features.  This one has TWO commentaries--one featuring writer/director Coscarelli and co-writer Romano (moderated by Anchor Bay's Perry Martin); the other with Coscarelli and author Joe R. Lansdale--an interview with Coscarelli; a documentary on Coscarelli's genre career; a special-effects featurette (hidden in an ""Easter egg""); and lots more!  It's well worth amazon.com's reasonable price of admission.All in all, ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" is a top-notch entry in Mick Garris' MASTERS OF HORROR series, and it leaves no doubt as to why Don Coscarelli was one of the first directors chosen to participate.  But even apart from the series and despite its short runtime of 60 minutes, the episode itself easily stands alone as a masterpiece of horror film, and it is sure to become a genre classic.  So even those rare horror fans not impressed by the overall TV series should seriously consider adding this flick to their collections.",5,An Incident to Get Moon-eyed About...or Even Moonfaced!,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,3963,"['was', 'first', 'episode', 'MASTERS', 'OF', 'HORROR', 'air', 'Showtime', 'when', 'series', 'debuted', 'October', '2005', 'director', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'fourth', 'series', 'segment', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'series', 'thus', 'far', 'series', 'one', 'ended', 'show', 'expected', 'continue', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'Longtime', 'genre', 'fans', 'will', 'recognize', 'name', 'Coscarelli', 'course', 'writer/director', 'classic', 'horror', 'flick', 'PHANTASM', '1979', 'sequels', 'director', 'co-writer', 'sword-and-sorcery', 'fantasy', 'THE', 'BEASTMASTER', '1982', 'writer/director', 'more', 'contemporary', 'horror-comedy', 'cult', 'favorite', 'BUBBA', 'HO-TEP', '2002', '.An', 'adaptation', 'short', 'story', 'genre', 'author', 'Joe', 'R.', 'Lansdale', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'story', 'BUBBA', 'HO-TEP', 'was', 'based', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'interesting', 'fresh', 'take', 'girl-chased-through-the-woods', 'slasher-type', 'flick', 'one', 'very', 'wry', 'twist', 'end', 'cute', 'actress', 'Bree', 'Turner', 'genre', 'fans', 'recognize', '2005', 'JEKYLL', '+', 'HYDE', 'Ellen', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'auto', 'accident', 'late', 'one', 'night', 'driving', 'rural', 'mountains', 'Oregon', 'crawling', 'wreckage', 'trying', 'assess', 'damage', 'Ellen', 'quickly', 'pursued', 'hulking', 'mountain-dwelling', 'madman', 'John', 'De', 'Santis', 'familiar', 'horror', 'fans', 'role', 'Lurch', 'short-lived', 'late-1990s', 'TV', 'series', 'THE', 'NEW', 'ADDAMS', 'FAMILY', 'Ellen', 'ordinary', 'damsel', 'distress', 'occasional', 'flashbacks', 'revealed', 'ex-husband', 'was', 'obsessive', 'survivalist', 'forced', 'participate', 'training', 'sessions', 'result', 'Ellen', 'few', 'tricks', 'up', 'sleeve', 'just', 'may', 'help', 'outwit', 'brutish', 'pursuer', 'survive', 'night.As', 'Lansdale', 'original', 'story', 'way', 'cliche', 'slasher', 'roots', 'script', 'Coscarelli', 'co-writer', 'Stephen', 'Romano', 'ratchet', 'up', 'even', 'higher', 'adding', 'elements', 'only', 'hinted', 'Lansdale', 'Coscarelli', 'director', 'create', '60-minute', 'visual', 'ride', 'dense', 'layers', 'thrills', 'suspense', 'shocks', 'lesser', 'directors', 'would', 'have', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'two-hour', 'flick', 'course', 'helped', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'abilities', 'Turner', 'talent', 'convincingly', 'vacillate', 'vulnerability', 'strength', 'as', 'well', 'intense', 'performance', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'who', 'Ellen', 'ex-husband', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'skills', 'menacing', 'presence', 'De', 'Santis', 'Even', 'Coscarelli', 'old', 'friend', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'who', 'became', 'genre', 'icon', 'playing', 'Tall', 'Man', 'classic', 'PHANTASM', 'series', 'delightfully', 'quirky', 'appearance.The', 'DVD', 'edition', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'pristine', 'digital', 'transfer', 'filmic', 'series', 'episode', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.77:1', 'almost', 'always', 'case', 'discs', 'cool', 'folks', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'DVD', 'chockful', 'bonus', 'features', 'one', 'TWO', 'commentaries', 'one', 'featuring', 'writer/director', 'Coscarelli', 'co-writer', 'Romano', 'moderated', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Perry', 'Martin', 'other', 'Coscarelli', 'author', 'Joe', 'R.', 'Lansdale', 'interview', 'Coscarelli', 'documentary', 'Coscarelli', 'genre', 'career', 'special-effects', 'featurette', 'hidden', 'Easter', 'egg', 'lots', 'more', 'well', 'worth', 'amazon.com', 'reasonable', 'price', 'admission.All', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'top-notch', 'entry', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'MASTERS', 'HORROR', 'series', 'doubt', 'why', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'was', 'one', 'first', 'directors', 'chosen', 'participate', 'even', 'apart', 'series', 'short', 'runtime', '60', 'minutes', 'episode', 'easily', 'alone', 'masterpiece', 'horror', 'film', 'sure', 'become', 'genre', 'classic', 'So', 'even', 'rare', 'horror', 'fans', 'not', 'impressed', 'overall', 'TV', 'series', 'should', 'seriously', 'consider', 'adding', 'flick', 'collections']",Masters of Horror - Don Coscarelli - Incident on and off a Mountain Road

What a great idea a bunch of influential directors in the horror genre doing one hour films.  Some were great and some not so great but every Sunday while the seasons played you'd have the opportunity to see something new in horror.These discs were originally released individually and someone could've easily payed twice as much as this set is worth, for those people, the people who probably followed the show the closest, were it's biggest supporters contributing ratings, and contributed money for their monthly Showtime subscriptions it sucks this wasn't released at first.For the people that liked the show but never picked any up this is a great deal.From a marketing and business side i guess this was smart to get more money out of people.Episode Guide Season 1Haeckel's Tale - ""Haeckel's Tale"" is about a man who takes shelter in a cabin in the woods of New England, and once inside is told not to leave---no matter what sounds he hears on the outside.

The acting is good (Ethan Embry turns in a surprisingly intense role in flashback sequences) and the gore and makeup effects are top notch (what else would you expect from Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger?).

In my eyes, they don't hold a candle to vol. 1, 2 & 4, but it's only a matter of degrees.In Don Coscarelli's (Phantasm) Incident On & Off a Mountain Road, the best of the three tales we have a woman who crashes into another car in the middle of nowhere.  Very soon, she's discovered by a madman who hunts her and captures her.  To his chagrin, however, she's no mere damsel in distress.  She married a survivalist and was taught the ins and outs of how to maim and kill predators.  What evolves is a neat piece of work that pits a serial killer against a survivalist-by-proxy.  Just, whatever you do, don't call him Moonface.Dance of the Dead features the ever-delightful Robert England as an MC to a post-apocalyptic nightclub that features, as its entertainment, both Billy Corgan AND zombies being cattle prodded to dance.  This passes for entertainment--well, that and huge numbers of deaths and rapes on the city streets.  Amidst this turmoil and carnage, love blooms, and a girl becomes a woman (not in a sexual way, just in a growing-up sort of way).  Not bad, but it really just didn't do much for me.Lastly is Pick Me Up, starring Fairuza Balk and Michael Moriarty.  They had a good thing going, taking serial killing to the next level, with not one but TWO killers.  I'm not giving anything away there, it's right on the package.  I pretty much liked it, until the very end when the ambulance comes and picks them up.

And I will always love Don Coscarelli, even if he never makes another good movie, because he made one of the best film has to offer in Phantasm. So when Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series started off with a Don Coscarelli flick, it was obviously a good pairing, right?Well, to an extent. While this is an interesting little tale, albeit one that falls apart at the end, the things that made Phantasm so great are notably absent or muted here; in other words, it's a decent little horror flick, but there's nothing about it that says ""this is a Don Coscarelli film."" And that, given that the idea of the series is to spotlight the guy behind the camera, seems to make it somewhat wanting.Bree Turner, whose career has mostly been limited to awful teen comedies, gets to flex her acting muscles as Ellen, the main character here. At the beginning, all we know is that she's driving, she has an accident, and that the indirect cause of that accident is a rather nasty Leatherface-type (John DeSantis of the thankfully short-lived Blade: The Series). As we get deeper into the tale, we learn that Ellen has a survivalist ex-husband (Ethan Embry, who made FreakyLinks worth watching) who taught her some tricks of the trade that might help her survive this rather nasty encounter.It's a fun little flick for what it is, and it's always nice to get an eyeful of Angus Scrimm. Things suddenly take a turn for the worse in the final five minutes, though, when one of the characters goes through a complete, and unexplained, shift in personality. Deus ex Machina, your moment has arrived! That does end things on a rather sour note, and the lack of what I can only call essential Coscarelli-ness doesn't help matters. But it's still fun. ** ",3,"Amusing, but not great.",1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,1835,"['Masters', 'Horror', 'Incident', 'Mountain', 'Road', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', '2005', 'love', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'even', 'never', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'offer', 'Phantasm', 'So', 'when', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'Masters', 'Horror', 'series', 'started', 'off', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'flick', 'was', 'obviously', 'good', 'pairing', 'right', 'Well', 'extent', 'interesting', 'little', 'tale', 'one', 'apart', 'end', 'things', 'made', 'Phantasm', 'great', 'are', 'notably', 'absent', 'muted', 'here', 'other', 'words', 'decent', 'little', 'horror', 'flick', 'nothing', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'film', 'given', 'idea', 'series', 'spotlight', 'guy', 'camera', 'make', 'somewhat', 'wanting.Bree', 'Turner', 'career', 'mostly', 'been', 'limited', 'awful', 'teen', 'comedies', 'flex', 'acting', 'muscles', 'Ellen', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'beginning', 'know', 'driving', 'accident', 'indirect', 'cause', 'accident', 'rather', 'nasty', 'Leatherface-type', 'John', 'DeSantis', 'thankfully', 'short-lived', 'Blade', 'Series', 'get', 'deeper', 'tale', 'learn', 'Ellen', 'survivalist', 'ex-husband', 'Ethan', 'Embry', 'who', 'made', 'FreakyLinks', 'watching', 'who', 'taught', 'tricks', 'trade', 'might', 'help', 'survive', 'rather', 'nasty', 'encounter.It', 'fun', 'little', 'flick', 'what', 'always', 'nice', 'get', 'eyeful', 'Angus', 'Scrimm', 'suddenly', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'final', 'five', 'minutes', 'though', 'when', 'one', 'characters', 'complete', 'unexplained', 'shift', 'personality', 'Deus', 'ex', 'Machina', 'moment', 'arrived', 'end', 'things', 'rather', 'sour', 'note', 'lack', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'call', 'essential', 'Coscarelli-ness', ""n't"", 'help', 'matters', 'still', 'fun', '**']",Masters of Horror - Don Coscarelli - Incident on and off a Mountain Road
