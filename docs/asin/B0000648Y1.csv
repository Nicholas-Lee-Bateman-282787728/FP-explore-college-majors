699417,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,B0000648Y1,Annie Van Auken,"[1, 1]","THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EDWARD D. WOOD JR. (1995) was assembled from 1994 interviews (identifiable by Lyle Talbot saying he's 92 and was born in 1902).For those mainly familiar with Tim Burton's highly fictionalED WOOD(1994), this hour and forty-eight minute documentary will present differing opinions on many events depicted in that film. Examples:Rev. Lynn Lemon claims no Baptist ever forced Ed to change the title of ""Graverobbers From Outer Space"" to ""Plan 9,""  and implies that Wood did so himself to try avoiding paying royalties to investors.Loretta King and Dolores Fuller have conflicting memories ofBRIDE OF THE MONSTER(1955). Fuller's version coincides with Burton's, but Miss King says no one ever asked her for backing money, not even when production shut down temporarily, and that her agent arranged with Ed to give Loretta the female lead purportedly written for Dolores.Ed's first wife, Norma McCarty, and her son Mac (from a previous relationship), were left out of Burton's picture, arguably because her story was similar to Fuller's. Norma, who has a stewardess cameo inPLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE(1959), gave Wood, her husband of several months, the boot when he confessed to being a crossdresser.In her interview segments, the former Vampira lays around, looking obese, ugly and every day of her 72 years. She gleefully cackles over the idea that Ed tried patterning himself after Orson Welles, then indiscreetly reveals that the director ofCITIZEN KANE(1941) gave her a dose of the Clap.Also appearing are actors Connie Brooks and Paul Marco, plus Ed's production partner, Crawford Thomas, who's the producer of this documentary. All have loving memories of Wood, in contrast with Bela Lugosi Jr., whose venomous remarks about Ed must've had him spinning in his grave. Jr.'s assertion that Wood exploited his dad and put him in the worst sort of movies omits the fact that dad was already working in bombs before Ed came along.It's not entirely true that Lugosi was a ""has-been"" by the time Wood and he met, yet, except for one TV role, he did have a four year lay-off betweenABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN(1948) and  the stinkerooVAMPIRE OVER LONDON, also &uuml;ber sillyBELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA(both 1952). Ed's infamous semi-biopicGLEN OR GLENDA(1953) was Bela's next film after ""Gorilla."" In hindsight, it's far more memorble than either ""London"" or ""Gorilla."" During a four movie association with ""Eddy,"" Lugosi also appeared inTHE BLACK SLEEP(1956), with Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney, John Carradine, Akim Tamiroff and Ed's very own Tor Johnson, so his working with Wood didn't end other opprtunities..THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EDWARD D.

Wood, Jr..  He's done it rather well. Ed Wood and Orson Welles used their own money and private resources to finance the original ""Independent Movies"" of the 1950's and 1960's. Welles you've heard of. And today, we also remember Ed Wood. He directed the still humorous classic ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  Ed Wood was so broke he couldn't pay the lab to develop the film on his last movie. ""We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives"". Those were his words. This is his life. A complete work of love, ""The Haunted World of Ed Wood"" reviews his first 5 movies, his amusing Hollywood antics, and his own personal decline.  Bulging with special features, easter eggs, interviews, premieres, and memorials, ""The Haunted World of Ed Wood"" chronicles the now famous B-picture director and casts bright lights on a 1950's Hollywood we can no longer find. From Vampira to Bela Lugosi(including rare 1932 interviews), actors living and dead are interviewed(where possible) for this tribute to the sexually ambiguous Wood. This brand new DVD enhances the original 1995 documentary and includes the first complete release of Wood's 22-minute western, ""Crossroads of Laredo(featuring director Wood acting in 3 small parts)"".  Somewhere in another dimension, in a place known as B-picture heaven, the fog is starting to lift. The lights have flickered on. The camera box is dirty. There's dust on the lens. The actors flub their lines. The cardboard set shakes a little. Somebody mutters about getting paid.

699419,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B0000648Y1,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","I didn't find this documentary as compelling as the earlier ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood"" (which is an extra on Image's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" DVD), nor Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood""--despite it's being a controversial subject for many of the real-life participants.  THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EDWARD D. WOOD JR. reeks of being a pandering puff-piece; with only Bela Lugosi's son able to cut through the Wood mystique, calling Ed a ""user"" who only latched on to Lugosi's fame in order to give his movies some class and credibility.Loretta King, the star of ""Bride of the Monster"", finally closes the case on the alleged money which secured her the leading role.  It turns out that Ms King was approached by a pair of agents who offered the project to her; money never came into the deal whatsoever.  And as for Dolores Fuller, Wood's one-time muse and the leading lady of his opus ""Glen or Glenda?"", the woman is still obviously embittered by the whole affair and continues to stick by her version of events: Wood wrote the role in ""Bride of the Monster"" especially for her but later ditched Fuller when Ms King -- a starry-eyed, would-be actress brandishing a hefty inheritance -- was able to bankroll the film in exchange for the lead.  Well, this might be true but Fuller wasn't exactly great shakes as an actress--she later left the profession to become a songwriter.  Perhaps Wood was aware of Fuller's dramatic shortcomings and invented the story just to get her out of the way?  Who knows...and frankly who cares?Maila Nurmi (Vampira) manages to cut through the treacle with her impressive, commanding interview.  This woman was truly something and is sadly missed.  The re-creation of ""Crossroads of Laredo"" (Wood's first, unfinished movie project) will only be appreciated by the hardcore Wood fans but is still quite tedious; and the pieces of rare footage from Wood's TV commercials and home movies are the only other things I can recommend.

699421,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0000648Y1,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[5, 5]","Ed Wood is generally regarded as a person it is acceptable to ridicule.  Born in 1924 in Poughkeepsie, New York, he spent his childhood and youth in thrall to pulp fiction, comic books, and movie matinees. After distinguishing himself in combat during World War II, he drifted to Hollywood with an itch to drink, wear women's clothes, and make movies.  He did all three--and in the case of the latter Wood, although he would act, write, direct, and otherwise participate in at least thirty-eight films, is generally considered one of the most profoundly inept artists in the history of cinema.Wood is best known for a series of ultra-low budget films he wrote and directed in the 1950s: GLEN OR GLENDA, JAIL BAIT, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, NIGHT OF THE GHOULS, and most infamously PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  By the mid-1960s Wood's drinking problem, always significant, began to overcome him, and he eeked out a living by writing and occasionally directing pornography.  He died of heart failure, most like brought on by his many years of alcoholism, in 1978.At the time of his death none of the trade papers even bothered to print an obituary.  Two years later he was made famous by the book THE GOLDEN TURKEY AWARDS--but it was fame of a dubious sort inasmuch as the book described Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE as the worst film ever made.  Largely due to this description, Wood's films began to surface again and became popular due to their very ineptness.  By 1996 interest was such that producers Crawford John Thomas and Brett Thompson were able to swing a documentary.Directed by Brett Thompson, THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EDWARD D. WOOD JR. is essentially a series of interviews intercut with each other and footage drawn largely from Wood's various films.  As a premise, it is hardly original--but it works extremely well, and Thompson astutely introduces as many of his interview subjects as possible in a highly theatrical and very retro manner that plays remarkably well into the story of both Wood's folly and ultimate self-destruction.  The subjects are often quite remarkable as individuals: the articulate, self-mocking Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi), who appeared in PLAN 9; the fluttery and intensely sincere Delores Fuller, Wood's former lover and sometimes film star; the very handsome and flatly forthright Bela Lugosi, Jr.; and many, many others.Slowly but surely, the subjects unravel Ed Wood to the viewer, some of them taking him very seriously (more than one considered him a very talented man who simply never got the breaks), some ripping into him as incompetent both as a filmmaker and a person (Vampire describes him as a buffon and Lugosi Jr. as ""a user and a looser."")  And more than once they contradict each other in their accounts--most particularly Delores Fuller and Loretta King, who flatly dispute each other's statements and who give rise to the thought that Wood himself may well have told very different stories to each.As the documentary progresses it acquires a certain sense of nostalgia for the days of B movies, when almost any one--including Ed Wood--could manage to line up backers for an inexpensive horror flick, no matter how bad it might be.  When it at last concludes, it delivers a surprising sense of sadness, loss, poignancy for the man who dreamed far, far beyond the scope of his talents.  While it may not be on a ""serious"" subject, the documentary delivers what it set out to: a portrait of Wood as a human being.  As such, it becomes a bit difficult to laugh at him at all, no matter how much we may laugh at the various films he created.When released theatrically, the documentary ran at ninety minutes; with previously cut material restored the DVD runs at one hundred twelve.  It also comes loaded with extras, including Wood's first known film, an unfinished western titled STREETS OF LAREDO; footage of the documentary's Hollywood premiere; a reunion of Wood's cast members at a Palm Springs film festival; a much more.  Although you might think THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EDWARD D. WOOD, JR. would appeal most to Wood fans, I suspect it will also appeal to any one interested in the film industry of the 1950s--and it will prove much more touching than they expect.

699424,AD3EX5UG7UZPB,B0000648Y1,"Marcos ""proletariat""","[0, 0]","&#34;Ed Wood&#34; the Johnny Depp film, is by far the most entertaining study of Ed Wood's life and filmmaking career, his methodology of making B films and his uniquely wild and somewhat deranged personality - where he lacked in talent he made up for in enthusiasm and passion for filmmaking - as well as his relationship with the late great Bela Lagosi, who he brought out of retirement to act in his films and also cared for during his geriatric addiction to morphine. As bad as most of Wood's films were, they were undeniably innovative and entertaining.This film, made two years later, is an actual documentary (one of only two ever made - read on) based on Ed Wood (as opposed to a dramatized biographical film like &#34;Ed Wood&#34;),that centers on how, after his death, his b-films became cult classics and what their impact was, along with his relationships and his unique place within the B-film industry within Hollywood.The sometimes bizarre and quirky interviews of people who knew him and worked with him are humorous and interesting - whether they were partially staged/scripted or not, but it is certainly missing some of the more important folks as some of the other reviews mention, and his 10-year decline into soft core porn is breezed by in one cut within the film, which is a huge blunder... whether fans of Wood like it or not, that was what he did for the entire last decade of his career. The filmmakers should have held themselves and this film to a higher standard - especially after the huge success of the film Ed Wood with Johnny Depp two years prior to the Haunted World's release.The film does however have something that no other does, and that is the unreleased footage of &#34;Crossroads of Laredo&#34; one of Ed Woods unreleased films - so for serious Ed Wood fans, this is a must. Otherwise it is an okay homage to Ed Wood but a lot of talking heads and not enough quality content.  However, the bonus features are generous and good, and I have to give the makers credit for including a balance of perspectives on Wood - most of them are fond memories but they don't omit people like Lagosi, Jr. and others who did not like him (as much as I disagree with Lagosi, Jr. that Ed Wood exploited his father for his name - Lagosi was not working and was a morphine addict who Ed grew to deeply care for as is shown in &#34;Ed Wood&#34; as well as documented in other interviews of people who knew him.For serious fans, it is important to note the one other documentary that exists on Ed, which is very well received and known as both &#34;The Ed Wood Story: Plan 9 Companion&#34; and &#34;Flying saucers over Holllywood: Plan 9&#34;Plan 9 is a reference to the film Plan 9. I have never seen either Plan 9 or the documentary, but would like to, as far as I can see it has never been released on DVD, and there are only a few VHS copies as of the writing of this review that are for sale on Amazon, with two different covers but to my knowledge the same film. That film examines the directorial history of Ed Wood with particular attention to the making of 'Plan 9' and again, is considered the better documentary of the two.",3,"Interesting, worth the watch, but not a consummate study at all.

Ed Wood comes across as a director with limited talent but unlimited enthusiasm, who had a real love for making movies.  Most people remembered Ed fondly, but a few did not have kind things to say about him.  Bela Lugosi, Jr. called Ed a user and a loser, who put his famous father in his movies just to capitalize on Lugosi's celebrity status.  What he fails to mention is that, by the time Ed Wood met him, Bela Lugosi was a has been that nobody else would even hire.  Gregory Walcott, who played the pilot Jeff Trent in ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" likened the movie's production to a grade school play.  I give Brett Thompson credit for including those interviews, to balance the documentary with those who only praised Ed's efforts.  The biggest complaint I have about this documentary is the fact that it doesn't include Ed Wood's work in soft-core pornographic movies, acting in ""Pretty Models All In A Row"" and directing ""Necromania,"" his final film.  While it's sad to see what depths Ed had sunk to in his later years, it was an important part of his life that is entirely omitted.  The highest praise I have is for one of the DVD's many bonus features.  They managed to find and restore ""Crossroads Of Laredo,"" Ed Wood's very first directorial effort.

Besides directing some of the worst movies ever made (&quot;Plan 9,&quot; &quot;Glen or Glenda,&quot; &quot;Night of the Ghouls,&quot; &quot;Necromania&quot;), he is semi-famous for giving Bela Lugosi dual immortality (star of the best and worst horror films) and dressing up as a woman.This well produced documentary tracks his life through interviews with Wood co-workers (Crawford Thomas, Paul Marco, Harry Thomas, Gregory Walcott) friends (Joe Robertson, David Ward) and lovers (Dolores Fuller, Norma McCarty), film clips, home movies, and photographs.The film has some flaws. Interviewees ramble off topic, they talk about Wood as if he were a great filmmaker, and his later, uglier output is barely mentioned.
