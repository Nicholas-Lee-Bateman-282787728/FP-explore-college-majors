1364046,AAZRWLML88IZK,B003UD7JDA,A kids review,"[4, 49]","'Raising Hope' is one of the more puzzling ""comedies"" in recent memory: Nothing about it is funny and it strands two outstanding actors in a vehicle that fails to harness their many talents.'Raising Hope' is broad, shrill and aggressively wacky until the last couple minutes of the show's pilot, when the main characters are allowed to have a moment that is unlike everything that came before, in that it feels real and takes place on a human scale.That's when the show lost me completely -- the tacked-on attempt to give the show some heart was so disappointingly cynical and contrived. It was a transparent attempt to give depth to something that had so vociferously lacked it that I was convinced that the show's creator, Greg Garcia, was working out some anger issues by creating this cacophonous show.The premise is a knee-slapper -- oh, no, wait, it isn't. Young Jimmy impregnates a criminal, and has to raise the baby she later gives birth to. He is clueless about raising babies, but in ways that make him seem brain-damaged, not in ways that are laughter-inducing. If you find child endangerment hilarious, this may just be the show for you.Lucas Neff, who plays Jimmy, has the kind of sincere demeanor you'd find in a coming-of-age drama, which makes the rest of his family seem like they're in a different show. Cloris Leachman plays an extremely inappropriate grandma, and the show as a whole is full of almost-offensive stereotypes about lower-class people. Still, the broadness and the brashness wouldn't be a problem if any of what transpires was funny. It isn't.The real crime here isn't that the show lacks the sweetness that Garcia's 'My Name Is Earl' had for a couple of seasons, before it devolved into a more crass and average show. No, the crime of 'Raising Hope' is that Garret Dillahunt and Martha Plimpton are wasted here as Jimmy's parents. They're among the most enjoyable dramatic actors working in TV today, and 'Raising Hope' doesn't begin to use the full array of their talents. With any luck, this show will be canceled soon and they can go back to doing what they do best -- on other shows.",1,Infantile Antics Waste Good Actors,1316908800,"09 25, 2011",2011,2123,"[""'Raising"", 'Hope', 'one', 'more', 'puzzling', 'comedies', 'recent', 'memory', 'Nothing', 'funny', 'two', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'vehicle', 'harness', 'many', 'talents', ""'Raising"", 'Hope', 'broad', 'shrill', 'aggressively', 'wacky', 'last', 'couple', 'minutes', 'show', 'pilot', 'when', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'allowed', 'have', 'moment', 'everything', 'came', 'before', 'real', 'place', 'human', 'scale.That', 'when', 'show', 'lost', 'completely', 'tacked-on', 'attempt', 'give', 'show', 'heart', 'was', 'so', 'disappointingly', 'cynical', 'contrived', 'was', 'transparent', 'attempt', 'give', 'depth', 'something', 'had', 'so', 'vociferously', 'lacked', 'was', 'convinced', 'show', 'creator', 'Greg', 'Garcia', 'was', 'working', 'out', 'anger', 'issues', 'creating', 'cacophonous', 'show.The', 'premise', 'knee-slapper', 'oh', 'wait', ""n't"", 'Young', 'Jimmy', 'criminal', 'raise', 'baby', 'later', 'birth', 'clueless', 'raising', 'babies', 'ways', 'make', 'seem', 'brain-damaged', 'not', 'ways', 'are', 'laughter-inducing', 'find', 'child', 'endangerment', 'hilarious', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'show', 'you.Lucas', 'Neff', 'who', 'Jimmy', 'kind', 'sincere', 'demeanor', ""'d"", 'find', 'coming-of-age', 'drama', 'rest', 'family', 'seem', ""'re"", 'different', 'show', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'extremely', 'inappropriate', 'grandma', 'show', 'whole', 'full', 'almost-offensive', 'stereotypes', 'lower-class', 'people', 'Still', 'broadness', 'brashness', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'problem', 'what', 'transpires', 'was', 'funny', ""isn't.The"", 'real', 'crime', 'here', ""n't"", 'show', 'sweetness', 'Garcia', ""'My"", 'Name', 'Earl', 'had', 'couple', 'seasons', 'devolved', 'more', 'crass', 'average', 'show', 'No', 'crime', ""'Raising"", 'Hope', 'Garret', 'Dillahunt', 'Martha', 'Plimpton', 'are', 'wasted', 'here', 'Jimmy', 'parents', ""'re"", 'most', 'enjoyable', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'working', 'TV', 'today', ""'Raising"", 'Hope', ""n't"", 'begin', 'use', 'full', 'array', 'talents', 'luck', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'canceled', 'soon', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'doing', 'what', 'do', 'best', 'other', 'shows']",N/A

This show is very well written and all the characters are fun and likable.The Chance family pulls together when they get an unexpected new addition to their family.  Mom, Virginia(Martha Plimpton) and dad, Burt(Garret Dillahunt), know what it's like to raise a child while young, since they had their son Jimmy(Lucas Neff)at 15.  Now that Jimmy suddenly finds himself a new dad at 23, raising a child on his own, he looks to his parents for guidance and support.  Hilarious flashbacks show us just how Jimmy survived being raised by such a crazy family.  They all live with Virginia's grandmother Maw Maw, played perfectly by Cloris Leachman, as a senile old lady that barely knows where she is from one day to the next.This show is easy to watch over and over, and laugh every time! It's the little things you pick up in the background sometimes that really make you laugh -- like Jimmy's cousin drying his pants by holding them up, while riding his bike around the yard, in his underwear.

1364056,A1FW37K0DKH5M9,B003UD7JDA,David Seaman,"[0, 0]","Greg Garcia has hit the jackpot twice in a row, first with his now classic, ""My Name Is Earl"" which took a look at the good heart nehind a man destined to be ""trailer park trash"" and now with the even more brilliant ""Raising Hope."" ""Raising Hope"" is to Amigos des Garcia as ""Frasier"" was to Grub Street Productions. Where ""Wings"" was the middle school training for Angell, Casey and Lee, ""My name is Earl"" was excellent training for Greg Garcia It has been a long long time since a televisionn show of this quality has aired on television: cable, network or otherwise.Garcia seems to have the knack of finding the humor in the normalcy of the lower middle class. In this case our protaginist is a twenty year old male who in his van on his way home from buying ice cream is met with a frantic young woman beating on his van windows screaming for help. Jimmy, our protagonist behind the wheel, sees a man chasing this young, lithe woman and she scrambles into the passenger side screaming, ""Go Drive! Fast! Please!"" After they get way and end up parked in front of the home he shared with his 37 year old parents, Burt who impregnanted his high school girlfriend Virginia, played by the well decorated Martha Plimpton, at a friends Sweet 16 party in high school,and their ""Maw Maw"", an 84 year old senile great grandmother of Jimmy expertply played by the living legend, Cloris Leachman. From the passenger seat, in safety, the young girl says to Jimmy, ""You saved my life. You're a hero."" Then the smile; ""And you're cute."" She drags him into the back of his van, which begins to rock. When Jimmy awakens in the van the next morning and joins the family for breakfast, the lively yong girl is charming the family with how Jimmy was her hero. She excuses herself to the bathroom (in a delightful monologue expertly deliegvered by Plimpton on the quirks and personality of the toilet if she ""means to do big business.""- how many of our own toilets have a personali8ty like our second cars?) Jimmy says he thinks he has found the reason for life: love. ""By the way, does anyone know her name?"" Cousin Mike says, ""Lucy"" as he points to the television behind Jimmy. They all turn and see the news report that this girl is a wanted serial killer; at least two ex-bpoyfriends have been killed. They interview a cop who describes her as sweet but very dangerous and the man who chased her the night before. Breathlessly, he goes into detail about how she tried to kill him, and how she escaped when she jumped into some guys van. He then looks directly into the news camera: Good luck to you, Dude. She was killing me cause I couldn't remember her birthday. It's May 12th; better buy a card now.""Jaws drop around the breakfast table just as we hear the second required flush and Lucy returns to the table looking like a 19 year old dance major. Virgina stubs her Marlboro Light, lifts the telvision and smacks Lucy in the back of the head with it. ""Call the cops,"" she says.Eight months later Jimmy is called to the prison where she is awaiting execution by electric chair. It is there where she tells him that the bulging belly she has is his child. ""But they will NEVER electricute a woman with a six month old baby."" sheis still effervescent and bubbly. There's a fast cut and we see Jimmy with a six year old baby on his lao witnessing her execution. Just like that he is a 20 year old father.And we're off and running.Not only is the premise delightful, but the writing is absolutely top notch and playing it over and over with eyes closed allows you to catch a great deal of brilliant dialogue as well as many inside jokes for the people who are aware of the famous cast and people who are very familiar with Garcia's work. Garcia is aware that he is creating not just for the television market but fo the DVD market. (Indeed a moment worth chuckling over and over is when rock singer Smoky, played by Jason Lee the star of ""My Name is Earl"", refers to BArney as Kenny- the name of his character on ""Earl."") Cloris Leachman manages to do things that are simply remarkable. The shooting schedule for this series- which averages between 40 and 60 scenes per episode, must be absolutely grueling and with a cast where Grandma is 37 and Grandpa is 39, to have Cloris Leachman (last seen on network TV as Ellen Richmond's mother on the short lived ""Ellen Show""-speaking of brilliant) keeping up- no, in fact- to be raising the bar for these younger actors, is nothing short of miraculous. The things that Garcia writes for Maw Maw are brilliant, but Leachman's performance couldn't be done by anyone else. For a woman who was once in the Miss America Beauty Contest awnd won an Oscar, their make up department is still put upon to make our 84 year old actress look as though she might be 84. Not enough can be said about her. (another wonderful moment is the family watching old home movies of Virginia's 7th birthday and Maw Maw is serving cake. Burt casually says to her, ""You look like that horny neighbor on Mary Tyler Moore."") Just as was the case on Mary Tyler Moore, Cloris is bille as a guest star and not in the up front credits; an hommage to her remakrable career.Jimmy, played by the aspiring and warming Lucas Neff, occasionally looks like a young John Lennon and we laugh at his precdicaments as he slowly discoverrs what it is to be a single father at the age of twenty and in love with a woman who ""has a boyfriend."" He is the narrator as well as the lead, despite the young baby whose name was changed from the Serial Killer's ""Princess Beyonce"" to ""Hope"". By mid season we are in love with these characters and are highly invested. Despit ethier lack of education, there is an innate beauty to their ability to love and care for Family (a classic moment is when Burt helps Maw Maw, who is revisiting her past, to deliver a baby on the very night that Jimmy's love interest has come to his home for the first time.They return home because Maw Maw's water has broken.) It's amazing what Garcia is able to get into a single episode; his B stories tie in beautifully with his A stories and by looking at the two closely, the message of that episode and the entire series becomes more strong.It would be re-miss to fail to discuss the music. Not only is the ASCAP music carefully chosen- and re-recorded so that remarkable moments are enhanced with music that goes back to the 60's (Before Grandma and Grandpa were born) but the character of Shelly, briliantly executed by Kate Micucci, strums a Yukele and sings- very well- some of the most wonderful original music and lyrics to ever be heard on television. Only Sondheim rhymes better within the context of dramatic music, and speaking of musi8c, Who ever knew that Martha Plimptom was a full out remarkable singer? She could be down center at the Gershwin if she chose. Garret Dillahunt plays Grandpa, and it['s hard to think of him with this name since he could be an Abercrombie model; we see his guitar skills as well as his ability for physical comedy over and over. The music supervisiors Jonathan Leahy Manish Raval and Tom Wolfe are more than worthy of a mention.If there is one television show in which you should become invested it is ""Raising Hope"". They're about to complete the second season and that DVD is available for pre-order. Season one is phenominal, so I suspect that season two will be even better. I am excited to have discovered a show as good as this one. There are others that are fantastic: ""The Middle"", "" Will and Grace"" , ""How I Met Your Mother"", ""sports Night"" even ""Friends"" (which also gets a polite nod of hommage in season one) and none of them are as good as this. This show is in the catagory with ""Mary Tyler Moore"", ""M*A*S*H*"", ""Frasier"" and ""All In The Family"".Buy it. Gift it. Donate it to Librarys and hospitals. The double entendre' of the title is infectious. Greg Garcia is the next greatest gift to American television and his name will be on the list with Jim Brooks, Max Muchnik and DAvid Kohan, Jim Borrows and (to your knees, ladies and geltelman) Warren Littlefield.Greg Garcia is making our world a more beautiful place.",5,Excellent Television where normal is insane and insane is normal; just like your house,1335744000,"04 30,

1364063,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003UD7JDA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[27, 30]","With the initiation of the 2010 television season, FOX was pinning its hopes and its largest advertising dollars on a couple of shows that ended up failing to strike a chord with the public. The promising serialized drama ""Lone Star"" was gone in two episodes and the high profile sitcom ""Running Wilde"" never gathered sufficient viewers and was dismissed by mid-season. Flying under the proverbial radar, however, was the wacky family of ""Raising Hope."" Created by the same team who made ""My Name Is Earl"" such a surprising success (remember how fresh Earl's early seasons were?), ""Raising Hope"" also balances an eccentric clan of working class heroes with clever slapstick shenanigans. But in a sitcom world populated with snappy one-liners and superficial partnerships, this program defies expectations by having a real heart. Aside from ABC's ""The Middle,"" no other current television family seems to face the economic trials and tribulations inherent in much of America--and it is in providing recognizable moments (albeit very heightened) that ""Raising Hope"" stands as a true original.There are plenty of peripheral characters on ""Raising Hope""--some more successful than others--but the core family at the center of the show is its true soul. Lucas Neff plays the lead character with a gawky and understated charm and stands as a perfect centerpiece to ground the show's more lunatic aspects. In my opinion, he's a star! A single dad (to Hope), Neff still lives with his parents and is a stock boy at the local grocery store. His parents, Martha Plimpton and Garret Dillahunt, are doing the best that they can but have failed to realize the dreams of their youth. As if the house weren't crowded enough, Plimpton's sporadically lucid mother (Cloris Leachman) also meanders through the action. This quartet of performers play off one another wonderfully and through all the silliness and all the annoyances, they stand as a remarkably believable and loving family unit. ""Raising Hope"" is a wildly successful domestic comedy employing slapstick, ludicrous sight gags, and clever verbal interplay. I love these guys--Plimpton and Dillahunt are at the top of their game!The show does, however, straddle numerous side plots and additional characters--and the show can lose its way a bit in juggling the extraneous material. Neff's supermarket girlfriend (Shannon Woodward) is a nice, if somewhat inconsistent, role. Her presence at family gatherings seems a bit mystifying at times--like the producers need to work her into the plot but don't know how to fully incorporate her into the action. One episode has the family deciding that she should inherit Hope should something happen to them. Huh? Really? Other supermarket employees provide the requisite wacky without any particular depth. Neff also has two friends that we see every 6-7 episodes for no apparent reason. And there are plenty of guest stars, many playing extended family members--Amy Sedaris and J.K. Simmons are particularly noteworthy. And the wonderful Kate Micucci pops up randomly as Shelly--as a romantic interest, or a babysitter, or to provide a random song. I love her, but again, it seems to be completely arbitrary when she materializes.I haven't mentioned Leachman, a grand dame of comedy, that seems somewhat underutilized here. Some episodes, she doesn't even speak--she's just around for a visual punchline or two. I think the producers realized this and begin to make her more lucid and less crazy in alternate episodes. A fearlessly over-the-top performance, though, she's great. Along with Neff, Dillahunt, and Plimpton--this is easily one of my favorite television families. And the affection for one another is infectious. With heart and humor, you might identify aspects of your own upbringing in the eccentricities of ""Raising Hope."" I know I do. 4 1/2 stars, the show is still gaining traction and needs a little more evenness. If everything here were as solid as the main family unit, this could be classic.

Jimmy's parents, who he lives with, are much less enthused about finding themselves suddenly saddled with a new baby and they lobby Jimmy hard to ""safe drop"" said baby at the local firehouse with Jimmy's mom actually cooing to the baby, ""Hey Punkin' wanna go see the fire trucks?"" However, by the end of the pilot episode there is a grudging acceptance of the newest member of the Chance clan and Jimmy's mother, played to absolute comedic perfection by Martha Plimpton, renames the baby Hope.Yes, this all seemed a bit too weird of a TV show for anyone to enjoy. But Jimmy's family is just too funny to resist. You've got the father who Jimmy works with at the family landscaping business, the tough as nails blonde mom who's a housekeeper and Maw Maw, a fantastic role done by none other than Cloris Leachman as Jimmy's great grandmother who suffers from Alzheimer's and a strong dislike for blouses and bras. And in many instances you wince while you laugh, but then there's an underlying sweetness about the power and love of a family that just hooks you in and keeps you coming back for more. These are the annoying white trash neighbors that you always hope don't move in next door to you--until your house burns down and your husband/wife dies in a car crash and they are the first to step up and help you, even though they'll loudly deny they're good people who do care.The truth is this little gem of a TV series has stolen my heart and made me laugh and even hold back a tear or two.

It looked like it was going to be a little too family friendly to me. I guess it could be to an extent, but not in the yawn-inducing, cheesy way that I assumed. There are so many one-liners that have me not just laughing during the show, but long after when certain quotes pop into my head. Definitely a very quotable show! Burt and Virgina have a really endearing relationship. They have their weird but very affectionate ways of expressing their love for each other. Cloris Leachman is amazing and she especially has so many one-liners that you can almost miss, but that subtlety is what adds to how funny it is. She also has some of the most risque lines of all of the characters, and the fact that she looks like a sweet and innocent elderly lady adds to the humor. I will also say that I kind of found Martha Plimpton to be annoying in some of the films she has been in, but this show made me realize it was her characters that I found obnoxious, not her.

1364069,ATP9LYGM6D3RO,B003UD7JDA,"McGillicutty ""DVD Fan""","[1, 1]","""Raising Hope"" has good pedigree with writer/creator Greg Garcia at the helm. And the first several episodes are witty, funny, and certainly up to the standard Garcia set with his previous effort, ""My Name Is Earl"".But with this episode, ""Blue Dots"", the folks at ""Raising Hope"" have created an instant classic up there with Seinfeld's ""The Contest"" and Frasier's ""The Matchmaker"".We begin with Shelley (the wonderfully quirky Kate Micucci) singing to the only residents left at her day care, dogs, when Virginia (Martha Plimpton) arrives with her grandbaby, Hope. Realizing that Hope might turn out a bit on the shaggy side if she grows up with canines, Jimmy (Lucas Neff) tries to enroll Hope in a more refined Day Care center when they find out his father, Burt (Garrett Dillahunt) has a prior sexual felony arrest that puts the dreaded ""Blue Dot"" on their house.This begins a wonderful cascade of events and misunderstandings that result in several more ""blue dots"" leading to Jimmy ""confessing"" his sins so-to-speak at the aforementioned ""uppity"" Day Care in a scene that's as letter-perfect as it is hilarious. Credit is certainly due to Lucas Neff who rides the line between sympathetic and somewhat goofy.Hope's great-great grandma Cloris Leachman delivers her usually great performance as the addled, clothing-optional ""Maw Maw"". Dillahunt steals practically every scene he's in, especially when ""cranking up"" the middle finger, but it's Plimpton who anchors this episode with her combo of exasperation and anger. She delivers the line of the show in the back of the cop car to Jimmy (I won't reveal what, but it gets funnier each time I hear it).I'm so glad ""Raising Hope"" has been renewed for a second season, especially after the way-too-early demise of ""My Name is Earl"".

She plays Virginia Chance and her performance is totally under-rated by the awards. Screw the Awards! Cloris Leachman also gives a great performance as a special guest star but she's in almost every episode as Maw Maw, Virginia's senile grandmother. Virginia, Maw Maw, and Jimmy Chance live with Virginia's husband, Mr. Chance, who is a pool cleaner and landscaper. Virginia works all day cleaning toilets.When Jimmy gets in a van with an escaped serial killer, they have intercourse. The next day, Virginia hits her over the head with a television set while watching the morning news. Nine months later in prison, Princess Beyonce is born on death row. At 7 months old, Jimmy and his baby watch the execution. Their state is not so forgiving. After all the mother was a female serial killer who targeted men.Anyway that is how the show begins and I can't imagine my Tuesday nights without them. The cast is first rate and the writing is also well-done. My question is where are the awards for this show and the recognition it deserves. Award shows always tend to favor the unusual but this show is blue collar and aimed for a mainstream audience in the country.
