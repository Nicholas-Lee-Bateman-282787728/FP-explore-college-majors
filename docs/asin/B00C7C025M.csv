I've watched this film twice and I'm completely in awe of the way ""adults"" behave around an impressionable, highly intelligent child. Newcomer Onata Aprile gives a spellbinding performance as Maisie. Onata is adorable. I hope she does more movies in the future because she's got the goods to go really far. Maisie's world gets turned upside down after parents go their separate ways. Julianne Moore and Steve Coogan play her parents. Julianne Moore delivers a heart-stopping performance as Suzanna. Suzanna is an aging rock star. Suzanna is outrageously selfish, arrogant, and shamefully neglectful towards Maisie. But its both of her parents that are toxic for Maisie. It's funny how much insight a young child has at that age. They absorb everything like a sponge. Maisie knows she's being used as a pawn. Maisie gets tossed back and forth between mom and dad, it's so sad because she never feels safe with either one of them. Alexander Skarsgaard and Joanna Vanderham also deliver strong performances. Skarsgaard plays Maisie's stepdad, and Vanderham plays Maisie's nanny. Their characters give Maisie the unconditional love and patience she deserves. This is a beautifully directed, well-acted underrated gem. I highly recommend it.

Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard) and Margot (Johanna Vanderham), who are briefly married to Suzanna and Beale respectively (but only because the latter think that being married will enhance their chances of having custody of Maisie), are left to pick up the pieces with Maisie, whose parents use them as go-betweens as Maisie is shuffled from one parent to the other.Not only is the acting superb, but the movie does an excellent job of showing the consequences of a fractured family situation from a young child's perspective. The confusion and bafflement that Maisie suffers is well portrayed, as is her growing wariness, particularly of her mother and father.

1643809,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B00C7C025M,Doug Park,"[0, 0]","{4.5 stars}WHAT MAISIE KNEW very effectively shows a child's eye view of the adult world and various things that the six-year-old protagonist understands perhaps better than anyone else. The audience attains a keen level of empathy with Maisie, caught in a crazy quadrangle of instabilities, jealousies, and intrusions of strangers. This film is fine satire on superficial priorities and relationships as well as the phoniness of the adult world in general. It's moving without being the least bit maudlin or melodramatic. Sometimes the plot seems tangential and that we need to know just a little bit more about the five central characters; however, that patchy quality still contributes something to one of the film's biggest themes, as quoted from the soundtrack in the title of this review.WHAT MAISIE KNEW is a subtle film that does not immediately grab you with action, suspense, or any of that sort of stuff; still, if you give it a chance to immerse you, it will. Excellent acting and character development, especially by Alexander Skarsgard as Lincoln and, of course, Onata Aprile as Maisie.A lot of screaming, cussing, and generally adult situations; otherwise, it hardly merits an ""R"" rating--No blatant violence/gore, sex/nudity, or other such elements.",5,"""I wonder if we ever really know each other""",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",2013,1265,"['4.5', 'stars', 'WHAT', 'MAISIE', 'KNEW', 'very', 'effectively', 'child', 'eye', 'view', 'adult', 'world', 'various', 'things', 'six-year-old', 'protagonist', 'perhaps', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'audience', 'keen', 'level', 'empathy', 'Maisie', 'caught', 'crazy', 'quadrangle', 'instabilities', 'jealousies', 'intrusions', 'strangers', 'film', 'fine', 'satire', 'superficial', 'priorities', 'relationships', 'as', 'well', 'phoniness', 'adult', 'world', 'general', 'moving', 'being', 'least', 'bit', 'maudlin', 'melodramatic', 'Sometimes', 'plot', 'tangential', 'need', 'know', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'five', 'central', 'characters', 'however', 'patchy', 'quality', 'still', 'something', 'one', 'film', 'biggest', 'themes', 'quoted', 'soundtrack', 'title', 'review.WHAT', 'MAISIE', 'KNEW', 'subtle', 'film', 'not', 'immediately', 'grab', 'action', 'suspense', 'sort', 'stuff', 'still', 'give', 'chance', 'immerse', 'will', 'Excellent', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'especially', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'Lincoln', 'course', 'Onata', 'Aprile', 'Maisie.A', 'lot', 'screaming', 'cussing', 'generally', 'adult', 'situations', 'otherwise', 'hardly', 'R', 'rating', 'blatant', 'violence/gore', 'sex/nudity', 'other', 'such', 'elements']",What Maisie Knew

Directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel transpose the tale to contemporary New York and transform it into a gut-wrenchingly powerful tale of a child (Onata Aprile) torn between two self-interested parents (Julianne Moore, Steve Coogan), and their respective spouses (Joanna Vanderham, Alexander Skarsgard).  Aprile's performance is quite simply remarkable - although obviously in love with both parents, she seems to accept everything that happens to her.  Neither parent seems particularly interested in her, despite their frequent protestations of love; the spouses try their best to make a life for Maisie, but have to cope with the fact that neither of them are her blood-relatives.  They therefore have no claim on her.  Directors McGehee and Siegel make wonderful use of New York locations: the shiny world of the upmarket apartment where Maisie has no real place; the stylish bar where Maisie has to spend one or two nights; the seedy whorehouse; and the continual shots of iconic yellow taxis, symbolizing the transience of Maisie's life.  In the end she achieves some kind of self-determination; it might not last very long, but at least it represents some kind of an advance on her past.

1643827,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00C7C025M,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.It's becoming increasingly rare in today's big blockbuster releases that a movie comes along and touches on the three major emotions; happiness, sadness, and anger. The former is less prevalent while the latter comes in brief spurts as you gain an understanding of these characters. Sadness, on the other hand, is the more dominant emotion in What Maisie Knew. It's very easy to fall in love with this little girl which makes it just as easy to feel bad for her when her life starts spiraling out of control. Her little world is far from pretty, but she's able to keep a somewhat optimistic mind in hopes that things turn around.To give you some context, What Maisie Knew centers around the titular Maisie (Onata Aprile), a seven year old girl who's having the misfortune of watching her parents split up. What starts as a custody battle soon turns into a quest for normalcy for this young girl. Both parents seem to view her as their trophy signifying that they've ""won"" the relationship, but neither has any plans of altering their lifestyle to compensate for the lack of a second parent. Instead, they settle for the nearest individual, get married, and hope that it gives them some sort of upper hand in court. Even when the court decides on joint custody, life for Maisie doesn't improve as she's left confused, abandoned, and unwanted.At its core, What Maisie Knew could really be viewed as a social commentary. It's message? Children are not blind. They see everything. They see the arguments, they hear the shouting, and they feel emotional pain. Not all abuse is physical and, in most cases, the emotional abuse is far worse than any bruise or scar. With that said, though, the writers did a good job of making a point without preaching it. It was never something that was said by a character, but rather something the viewer observed through Maisie's eyes. With a movie like this it would be very easy for the writers to come out and say, ""These parents suck!"" We know that already, but the writers made it a point to show that even though they have poor parenting skills, they still love Maisie.In addition, the writers also did a good job of being as delicate as possible with how they presented the message. There are arguments here and there (most of them distant), but there's no physical trauma and Maisie is no doubt a strong, intelligent character. She's very observant and it could be argued that she understands what's going on before one of the adults attempts to spell it out for her. As the movie progresses she realizes that life will never be what it once was, but when an opportunity presents itself she starts reconstructing a family of her own. One that loves her just as much as she loves it. It's a beautiful thing because by the end of it you can see she finally has a chance to be normal.In addition to Maisie, there are four other main characters. Susanna (Julianna Moore) and Beale (Steve Coogan), her parents; Margo (Joanna Vanderham), her nanny; and Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgrd), her mother's ""love interest"". Susanna's in a band which means she's always busy and Beale's a businessman who is constantly having to travel. As you can see, neither has much time for Maisie, and that's where Lincoln and Margo come in. Because Maisie's parents are incapable of taking care of her while still doing their job, most of the responsibility is placed on these two individuals. It soon becomes apparent that Susanna and Beale care just as much about Lincoln and Margo as they do Maisie. Which, as you can tell, isn't much.My only minor complaint is that the film suffers from some small pacing issues. However, this isn't something that plagues the entire film. The beginning of the movie is laid out really well as we follow Maisie to-and-from school. In fact, it isn't until the final act where things start to feel a little rushed. If I had to give a specific time frame I would say the last twenty minutes or so is when the problem first arose. While the conclusion to the story felt fitting given what this little girl had to go through, I couldn't shake the feeling that it was kind of sudden. With that said, though, it isn't something that detracted from my overall enjoyment of the story.As if the story wasn't enough to keep me engaged, the acting across the board was phenomenal. Onata's performance as Maisie was nothing short of heart-wrenching and for her first film I have to say that there isn't much to complain about. While the movie centers around her character, the writers never asked too much of her. This allowed her to excel in the simple tasks she was given. Even though Onata stole the show for me, Moore, Coogan, Vanderham, and Skarsgrd were all equally enjoyable. Skarsgrd in particular stood out with his performance as Lincoln. When you're first introduced to his character it's difficult to think of him as a good caretaker, but he really pulls through and makes you fall in love with him.Finally, the score, composed by Nick Urata, was just as beautiful as the film itself. It's very somber and quiet, but this makes it a perfect fit because the movie never gets too hectic. It's all very reserved and understated which makes for an extremely enjoyable experience. Each composition felt perfect for its accompanied scene and each piece felt like a unique piece of art. Just an all around fantastic film score.Overall Score: 8.5/10 - I was sold when I first saw the trailer for What Maisie Knew and I can't say that I was disappointed with the end result. Towards the end the pacing did get a little iffy, but I can't say that it ruined the film for me. It's just an all around fantastic story that's accompanied by some phenomenal acting and a beautiful score. I highly recommend you take the time to sit down and watch this. It's easily one of the best films I've seen this year.",4,8.5/10 - Beautiful,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",2013,5888,"['Note', 'May', 'contain', 'spoilers', 'Proceed', 'caution.It', 'becoming',

1643834,A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,B00C7C025M,"K. Corn ""reviewer""","[19, 21]","At the heart of this wonderful movie is a young girl, Maisie, played with both heartbreaking vulnerability and understated grace by newcomer Onata Aprile. Even well-written scripts can flounder if a child is miscast in a lead role. Thankfully, that isn't the case here.  The rest of the cast is also wonderful, from Julianne Moore (playing Maise's mother, Susanna) to Steve Coogan as Maisie's father, Beale.I'm wary about describing this film as one which focuses on a couple's break-up and divorce. I saw it as much more than that. The often confusing world of adults, as viewed from Maisie's perspective, left me wanting to shake her parents out of their self-centered life and somehow make them see that their daughter deserved so much more from them. To be truly heard. To be truly seen.I'm also concerned that my description (so far) may make this seem like a downer of a film. But I didn't find it depressing, at least not a good share of the time. I was heartened to see that strangers could have the insight - and compassion- to create a safe harbor for Maisie and try their best to help her.Ironically, by showing what Maisie sees and experiences - but without detailed commentary or analysis - her silence and facial expressions speak volumes (possibly even more powerfully than words). She is a child who is simply trying to trust, understand,  and make sense of the sudden changes in her life.. So the film's viewers see and hear what she does: her parents' arguments, her joy when visiting a pond full of turtles, her reactions when visiting a home or apartment for the first time.The filmmakers provide strong counterparts to the stereotypes of cruel stepparents. There are also  enough plot twists and suspenseful moments to create a well- paced movie, one which underscores the importance of trying to comprehend  events from a child's perspective. Or at least making a serious attempt, in spite of one's own pain.The final scenes took me by surprise so I won't write much about those. But I will note that Julianne Moore's performance in that concluding section is stellar. In only a few minutes, she conveys anger, confusion, grief, and more....and it is all achingly realistic.After seeing the film, I am now reading the James novel,What Maisie Knewfor extra insight as well as for comparison and contrast between James' perspective and the filmmakers take from a more contemporary viewpoint.",5,"Stunning and modern take based on a Henry James novel, focused on divorce -and more- from a child's perspective",1376265600,"08 12, 2013",2013,2411,"['heart', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'young', 'girl', 'Maisie', 'played', 'heartbreaking', 'vulnerability', 'understated', 'grace', 'newcomer', 'Onata', 'Aprile', 'Even', 'well-written', 'scripts', 'can', 'flounder', 'child', 'miscast', 'lead', 'role', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'case', 'here', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'wonderful', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'playing', 'Maise', 'mother', 'Susanna', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'Maisie', 'father', 'Beale.I', ""'m"", 'wary', 'describing', 'film', 'one', 'couple', 'break-up', 'divorce', 'saw', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'confusing', 'world', 'adults', 'viewed', 'Maisie', 'perspective', 'left', 'wanting', 'shake', 'parents', 'self-centered', 'life', 'somehow', 'make', 'see', 'daughter', 'deserved', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'be', 'truly', 'heard', 'be', 'truly', 'seen.I', ""'m"", 'also', 'concerned', 'description', 'so', 'far', 'may', 'make', 'seem', 'downer', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'depressing', 'least', 'not', 'good', 'share', 'time', 'was', 'heartened', 'see', 'strangers', 'could', 'have', 'insight', 'compassion-', 'create', 'safe', 'harbor', 'Maisie', 'try', 'best', 'help', 'her.Ironically', 'showing', 'what', 'Maisie', 'detailed', 'commentary', 'analysis', 'silence', 'facial', 'expressions', 'speak', 'volumes', 'possibly', 'even', 'more', 'powerfully', 'words', 'child', 'who', 'simply', 'trying', 'trust', 'understand', 'make', 'sense', 'sudden', 'changes', 'life..', 'film', 'viewers', 'see', 'hear', 'what', 'parents', 'arguments', 'joy', 'when', 'visiting', 'pond', 'full', 'turtles', 'reactions', 'when', 'visiting', 'home', 'apartment', 'first', 'time.The', 'filmmakers', 'provide', 'strong', 'counterparts', 'stereotypes', 'cruel', 'stepparents', 'are', 'also', 'enough', 'plot', 'twists', 'suspenseful', 'moments', 'create', 'well-', 'paced', 'movie', 'one', 'importance', 'trying', 'comprehend', 'events', 'child', 'perspective', 'least', 'making', 'serious', 'attempt', 'spite', 'one', 'own', 'pain.The', 'final', 'scenes', 'took', 'surprise', 'so', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'much', 'will', 'note', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'performance', 'concluding', 'section', 'stellar', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', 'conveys', 'anger', 'confusion', 'grief', 'more', '.and', 'achingly', 'realistic.After', 'seeing', 'film', 'am', 'now', 'reading', 'James', 'novel', 'What', 'Maisie', 'Knewfor', 'extra', 'insight', 'as', 'well', 'comparison', 'contrast', 'James', 'perspective', 'filmmakers', 'take', 'more', 'contemporary', 'viewpoint']",What Maisie Knew

Hard to watch, not because of some despicable violent act, but nuanced emotional torture of a 6 year old girl by her self-absorbed parents.  Maisie (Onata Aprile) is the reproductive outcome of a union between Susanna (Julianne Moore) Beale (Steve Coogan).  They all live together even though Susanna and Beale never married.  They do well financially.Susanna is the lead singer in a still touring rock band.  Kind of a stretch for Moore but there aren't any scenes of her actually singing at a concert.  Beale is a British business man who is constantly on the phone to someone in the world.  Things begin to fall apart between Susanna and Beale to the point that Beale moves out.  They are given joint custody but can never seem to coordinate their schedules.  This leaves Maisie in the hands of Margo (Joanna Vanderham), an au pair who has had eyes for Beale or Maisie's teachers and eventually Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgard), a bartender who Susanna marries as revenge for Beale's marriage to Margo.Maisie, becomes a ward of sorts to Margo and Lincoln as they each become targets of Susanna and Beale's self-centered lives.  What makes this film a little different is that when Maisie's parents talk with her one on one they seem like normal loving parents.  They coddle her, they kiss her, they hug her, and they promise her things.  But once that bubble bursts, it is like Maisie is invisible.  They argue...loudly and profanely.  As if Maisie isn't even in the room.  When Susanna ""must"" get on the tour bus, she hands Maisie off to a doorman.  Another time, she arrives early at school to get rid of her.  And another day she drops her off at the restaurant where Lincoln works.  Only Lincoln isn't working that day.  Like I said hard to watch.  As time goes on, Lincoln and Margo take over.  The ending is appropriately bittersweet.The Blu ray treatment is excellent.  It has a 2.40:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p resolution.  The look appears very natural from start to finish.  Modest grain give the film a nice quality.  Colors look good.  Blacks are black.  No complaints here.  Likewise the audio is very good.  Here we have a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless track.  This is a dialog centered film, so there isn't much going on in the surrounds except for some ambient street noise as well as some dish and glass chattering in an upscale bar/restaurant.  Co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel add a commentary track and there are a handful of deleted scenes to complete the extras.",4,(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars for an emotionally desperate film,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",2013,2579,"['hard', 'watch', 'film', 'was', 'actually', 'adapted', '100+', 'year', 'old', 'novel', 'Henry', 'James', 'Hard', 'watch', 'not', 'despicable', 'violent', 'act', 'nuanced', 'emotional', 'torture', '6', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'self-absorbed', 'parents', 'Maisie', 'Onata', 'Aprile', 'reproductive', 'outcome', 'union', 'Susanna', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Beale', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'live', 'together', 'even', 'Susanna', 'Beale', 'never', 'married', 'do', 'well', 'financially.Susanna', 'lead', 'singer', 'still', 'touring', 'rock', 'band', 'Kind', 'stretch', 'Moore', 'are', ""n't"", 'scenes', 'actually', 'singing', 'concert', 'Beale', 'British', 'business', 'man', 'who', 'constantly', 'phone', 'someone', 'world', 'Things', 'begin', 'fall', 'apart', 'Susanna', 'Beale', 'point', 'Beale', 'out', 'are', 'given', 'joint', 'custody', 'can', 'never', 'seem', 'coordinate', 'schedules', 'Maisie', 'hands', 'Margo', 'Joanna', 'Vanderham', 'au', 'pair', 'who', 'had', 'eyes', 'Beale', 'Maisie', 'teachers', 'eventually', 'Lincoln', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgard', 'bartender', 'who', 'Susanna', 'marries', 'revenge', 'Beale', 'marriage', 'Margo.Maisie', 'ward', 'sorts', 'Margo', 'Lincoln', 'become', 'targets', 'Susanna', 'Beale', 'self-centered', 'lives', 'What', 'film', 'little', 'different', 'when', 'Maisie', 'parents', 'talk', 'one', 'one', 'seem', 'normal', 'loving', 'parents', 'coddle', 'kiss', 'hug', 'promise', 'things', 'once', 'bubble', 'bursts', 'Maisie', 'invisible', 'argue', 'loudly', 'profanely', 'Maisie', ""n't"", 'even', 'room', 'When', 'Susanna', 'must', 'get', 'tour', 'bus', 'Maisie', 'doorman', 'time', 'early', 'school', 'get', 'rid', 'day', 'off', 'restaurant', 'where', 'Lincoln', 'Only', 'Lincoln', ""n't"", 'working', 'day', 'said', 'hard', 'watch', 'time', 'Lincoln', 'Margo', 'take', 'over', 'ending', 'appropriately', 'bittersweet.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'treatment', 'excellent', '2.40:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1080p', 'resolution', 'look', 'very', 'natural', 'start', 'finish', 'Modest', 'grain', 'give', 'film', 'nice', 'quality', 'Colors', 'look', 'good', 'Blacks', 'are', 'black', 'complaints', 'here', 'Likewise', 'audio', 'very', 'good', 'Here', 'have', 'Dolby', 'TrueHD', '5.1', 'lossless', 'track', 'dialog', 'centered', 'film', ""n't"", 'much', 'going', 'surrounds', 'ambient', 'street', 'noise', 'as', 'well', 'dish', 'glass', 'chattering', 'upscale', 'bar/restaurant', 'Co-directors', 'Scott', 'McGehee', 'David', 'Siegel', 'add', 'commentary', 'track', 'are', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'complete', 'extras']",What Maisie Knew

I can only imagine what little Maisie must have felt as she endured her love-ones yelling and arguing; ether that or enduring them going off leaving her all the time. Maisies mom Susanna (played by Julianne Moore) is a rocker. She wakes Maisie up one late night and brings  her to this bar where her stepdad Lincoln (played by Alexander Skarsgard) works. Susanna had a show to do and wanted Lincoln to look after Maisie for a while, but he wasn't there and the cab with mom inside drove away. Maisie fell asleep and a pretty waitress took her upstairs to bed. A little while after that, Maisie wakes up and finds what seemed to be the same waitress in the next room. The waitress was smoking, she seemed a little tired . Then this big-guy walks in and when Maisie sees him , she asks for her nanny margo (played by Joanna Vanderham) when little Maisie says she wants to go home, the waitress hugs her and puts her back to bed sweet little Maisie begins to cry. When I saw that scene it gutted me like a fish, Maisie had to stay there the whole night. That was one of my favorite scenes. the ending is happier, dear little Maisie finds her grace and finds a bit of peace, and there was this beautiful song, ''Feeling Of Being'' (performed by Lucy Schwartz)  the song says so much about Maisie, all that she went through, and it sums up her story.

1643849,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7C025M,Paul Allaer,"[54, 63]","""What Maisie Knew"" (2013 release; 93 min.) brings the story of Susanna (played by Julianne Moore) and Beale (played by Steve Coogan) and their young daughter Maisie (played by newcomer Onata Aprile). As the movie opens we see Susanna, an aging (has-been?) rock singer, and Beale, an arts dealer, arguing frequently and loudly, and in front of Maisie. It doesn't take long before Susanna changes the locks on the front door, and Beale gets his own place. Maisie finds some relief with Margo, the sitter. Susanna and Beale go to court, where Susanna gets denied sole custody, so off goes Maisie between Susanna's place and Beale's place. Maisie is very surprised to find out that Margo has moved in with Beale. At that point we are about 35-40 min. into the movie and to tell you more would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a tough child custody drama in which the child sadly becomes the playing ball of selfish adults around her. Quite a bit of the movie deals with missed/forgotten/rescheduled pick-up dates, and eventually the seeming annoyance that Maisie really becomes to both Susanna's and Beal's post-divorce lifestyles, despite the attempts (often botched) by Beale to sound or be nice. At one point Maisie arrives at his house, and he picks her up and smothers her while saying ""there is my 6th favorite girl!"". Maisie of course immediately asks ""who are the other 5 girls?"", to which Beale sheepishly mumbles ""you wouldn't understand."" Maybe not, but surely this kind of exchange will leave marks on this young girl. In fact, besides the young girl itself, there isn't a single likeable lead character in the whole movie, and at a certain point you just want to reach out to the screen and slap these people and shake them up. In that sense, this is a difficult movie to watch, but at the same time, you must give credit to co-writers Nancy Doyne and Carroll Cartwright and co-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel for creating characters who are not likeable but unfortunately probably very realistic in many real-life divorces. Kudos to young Onata Aprile, who brings a terrific performance as Maisie. As I watched her, I couldn't help but think back to that other divorce-custody drama starring a young child, and that is of course 1979's ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", starring Justin Henry as the little boy (if memory serves me right, he was nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar). What a classic that movie was, and still is.I recently saw ""What Maisie Knew"" at the Cedar Lee, the art-house theatre in Cleveland, and the screening I was at was not very well attended (and I'm being mild). Given the tone and subject matter of the movie, I just cannot see this reaching a wide audience in theaters. Bottom line, ""What Maisie Knew"" is not a feel-good movie (for that, check out the recent movie ""The Sapphires""), but in my opinion it's still worthwhile checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD.",4,"""You are my 6th favorite girl!"": Unlikeable Characters Course 101",1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,3015,"['What', 'Maisie', 'Knew', '2013', 'release', '93', 'min', 'story', 'Susanna', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Beale', 'played', 'Steve', 'Coogan', 'young', 'daughter', 'Maisie', 'played', 'newcomer', 'Onata', 'Aprile', 'movie', 'see', 'Susanna', 'aging', 'has-been', 'rock', 'singer', 'Beale', 'arts', 'dealer', 'arguing', 'frequently', 'loudly', 'front', 'Maisie', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'before', 'Susanna', 'locks', 'front', 'door', 'Beale', 'own', 'place', 'Maisie', 'relief', 'Margo', 'sitter', 'Susanna', 'Beale', 'go', 'court', 'where', 'Susanna', 'denied', 'sole', 'custody', 'so', 'Maisie', 'Susanna', 'place', 'Beale', 'place', 'Maisie', 'very', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Margo', 'moved', 'Beale', 'point', 'are', '35-40', 'min', 'movie', 'tell', 'more', 'would', 'surely', 'ruin', 'viewing', 'pleasure', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'see', 'how', 'out.Couple', 'comments', 'first', 'foremost', 'tough', 'child', 'custody', 'drama', 'child', 'sadly', 'playing', 'ball', 'selfish', 'adults', 'Quite', 'bit', 'movie', 'deals', 'missed/forgotten/rescheduled', 'pick-up', 'dates', 'eventually', 'seeming', 'annoyance', 'Maisie', 'really', 'Susanna', 'Beal', 'post-divorce', 'lifestyles', 'attempts', 'often', 'botched', 'Beale', 'sound', 'be', 'nice', 'one', 'point', 'Maisie', 'house', 'up', 'smothers', 'saying', '6th', 'favorite', 'girl', 'Maisie', 'course', 'immediately', 'who', 'are', 'other', '5', 'girls', 'Beale', 'sheepishly', 'mumbles', 'would', ""n't"", 'understand', 'Maybe', 'not', 'surely', 'kind', 'exchange', 'will', 'leave', 'marks', 'young', 'girl', 'fact', 'young', 'girl', ""n't"", 'single', 'likeable', 'lead', 'character', 'whole', 'movie', 'certain', 'point', 'just', 'want', 'reach', 'out', 'screen', 'slap', 'people', 'shake', 'up', 'sense', 'difficult', 'movie', 'watch', 'same', 'time', 'must', 'give', 'credit', 'co-writers', 'Nancy', 'Doyne', 'Carroll', 'Cartwright', 'co-directors', 'Scott', 'McGehee', 'David', 'Siegel', 'creating', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'likeable', 'unfortunately', 'probably', 'very', 'realistic', 'many', 'real-life', 'divorces', 'Kudos', 'young', 'Onata', 'Aprile', 'who', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Maisie', 'watched', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'back', 'other', 'divorce-custody', 'drama', 'starring', 'young', 'child', 'course', '1979', 'Kramer', 'vs.', 'Kramer', 'starring', 'Justin', 'Henry', 'little', 'boy', 'memory', 'serves', 'right', 'was', 'nominated', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'What', 'classic', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'is.I', 'recently', 'saw', 'What', 'Maisie', 'Knew', 'Cedar', 'Lee', 'art-house', 'theatre', 'Cleveland', 'screening', 'was', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'attended', ""'m"", 'being', 'mild', 'Given', 'tone', 'subject', 'matter', 'movie', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'reaching', 'wide', 'audience', 'theaters', 'Bottom', 'line', 'What', 'Maisie', 'Knew', 'not', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'recent', 'movie', 'Sapphires', 'opinion', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'checking', 'out', 'be', 'theatre', 'DVD']",What Maisie Knew

Her parents, Susanna played by Julianne Moore, is a rock star, not a very convincing one in this film, however. Maisie's father, Beale, payed by Steve Coogan, is a businessman, who has no concept of what a father should be. Maisie becomes the pawn in these people's fights. Susanna loves her daughter, but lives such a narcissistic existence, she is not a good one. Divorce us inevitable, and Maisie is split between both parents. Each parent forgets to pick her up. Little Maisie in the middle is only looking for lve with no strings attached.

They were soon rejected by their spouses, yet they were anchors in Maisie's life, and I found them very likeable.If it was supposed to be a thriller, I would say that, all through, I felt  unease that something terrible would happen to Maisie, as she was so neglected by the parents, left alone in public places, waiting for someone to take her home etc. One night, she wakes up, to find herself in a house with people she doesn't know. I hadn't read this book, but I recalled that other books by Henry James did not end happily.However, although, a bit up in the air about the future, I think the ending was very satisfactory.Maisie accepts all that happens to her, she is such a good little girl.

1643862,AWUUMER0F3WF4,B00C7C025M,Sheryl Fechter,"[2, 2]","This highly emotional movie begins with little Maisie (Onata Aprile) being prophetically sung ""Rock a Bye Baby"" to by her misleadingly caring mother Susanna (Julianne Moore) at bedtime.  Her tone changes quickly and sharply to the tune of a narcissistic woman, self-absorbed in her touring rock and roll life with little to anytime for her daughter.  Her father, Beale (Steve Coogan), is equally toxic with his outright ranting and neglect of his daughter. While they are divorcing and embroiled in a horrible custody battle, they drag their innocent and fragile daughter right through it.  The whole story of this painful experience is seen through her eyes, and what wildly expressive eyes this whimsical little girl has.As her parents are in an all-out custody war at their homes and in the courts, Maisie cannot find any attention, love, or security that remains anywhere which she may count on, not even within her school classroom.  Her parents drag her in and out of there, drop her off at the wrong times, forget to pick her up, leave her all alone, and all for their own selfish reasons.  They shockingly use her as a pawn to get digs into the other.  A 'whom do you love more?' situation that does not offer much to any to her in the first place. Her single worded answers to her parents baiting questions about each other could fill whole paragraphs with their delivery.  Maisie also has an incredible ability to show a facially flat-affect as easily as joy and laughter while enduring all she does.Quite succinctly, Beale marries the ""Nanny"", Margo (Joanna Vanderham), and a spitefully jealous Susanna marries a bartender, Lincoln (an amazing Alexander Skarsgard), whom Maisie hasn't met and does not even yet know.  These two completely lovely people wind up transcending the despicable parents and offer the unconditional love for Maisie while all three are trapped within the parents constant fighting.  The parents scream at one another brutally, violently swearing in front of Maisie while she tiptoes around them.  She makes her own food at six years old, gets dressed herself, basically is in charge of parenting her parents at times.  As much as Maisie is tossed about, the new spouses are being equally neglected and are falling more and more in love with Maisie; she is always left in their charge.  During this fever-pitch which the parents are continually whipping up without respite; Margo and Lincoln, being thoroughly enchanted with Maisie, give us a place to finally exhale.  A blossoming relationship is forming between the two out of the mutual love for this adorable child and new found respectful adoration of each other.Direction (Scott McGehee and David Siegal) of this talented cast is tight while being at a slower more harrowing pace.  The soundtrack (Nick Urata) plays in an innocently childlike manner as seen from Maisie's take on her catastrophe.  An addition of the costumes (Stacey Battat) adds the appreciated color and liveliness to Maisie with touches of kitty-eared headbands, tutus of tulle, bright colored tights and boots of all types which lift her up and out of the dullness of her parents deathlike state.  A standout performance by the young Onata Aprile with her uncanny ability to bleed her own soul through her telltale eyes and keep you fully engaged in the movie.",5,"""When The Bough Breaks ...

1643880,A3OHZODU6YHOZ3,B00C7C025M,"Written Word ""Written Word""","[1, 2]","The palpable sweetness of the actress who plays Maisie the little girl and Alexander Skarsgaard who plays the bartender boyfriend cum step father are the only reasons to watch this otherwise unmemorable film.Julianne Moore is woefully miscast as a rock star mom whose bitterness toward her ex husband drags poor little Maisie into the middle of every argument.  Enter the pretty and sweet but potentially gold digging nanny, the self absorbed and absentee father and the gorgeous but potentially brain dead bar tender boyfriend and you have an amalgam of characters who manipulate and use each other while Maisie gets lost in all the adult chaos.For some reason, Skarsgaard appears to have only been given one t-shirt to wear the entire movie and was either told or elected to grotesquely slouch his way through every scene.  Julianne Moore gyrates wildly between smothering Maisie with ""mommy loves yous"" or screaming expletives into the phone (or face) of anyone who shows Maisie any kindness.  Through it all however, little Maisie shines on - she wins us over with her charm and vulnerability - yet at the core she clearly is the only one who is not an emotional trainwreck (yet).  She develops a sweet relationship with bartender Skarsgaard whom the mother employs,  then marries,  in an attempt to wrest custody from the ex husband.  The best moments are between Skarsgaard and Maisie and they are sweet and tender. I would like to see a remake of say Maisie goes to College- her mother is in rehab, her father on his sixth oh too young wife - and Skarsgaard and Maisie do the cross country trek together to drop her off at college somewhere out east - now that would be worth watching - !",3,The little girl is AMaising!!,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1695,"['palpable', 'sweetness', 'actress', 'who', 'Maisie', 'little', 'girl', 'Alexander', 'Skarsgaard', 'who', 'bartender', 'boyfriend', 'cum', 'step', 'father', 'are', 'only', 'reasons', 'watch', 'otherwise', 'unmemorable', 'film.Julianne', 'Moore', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'rock', 'star', 'mom', 'bitterness', 'ex', 'husband', 'drags', 'poor', 'little', 'Maisie', 'middle', 'argument', 'Enter', 'pretty', 'sweet', 'potentially', 'gold', 'digging', 'nanny', 'self', 'absorbed', 'absentee', 'father', 'gorgeous', 'potentially', 'brain', 'dead', 'bar', 'tender', 'boyfriend', 'have', 'amalgam', 'characters', 'who', 'manipulate', 'use', 'other', 'Maisie', 'lost', 'adult', 'reason', 'Skarsgaard', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'given', 'one', 't-shirt', 'wear', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'told', 'elected', 'grotesquely', 'slouch', 'way', 'scene', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'wildly', 'smothering', 'Maisie', 'mommy', 'yous', 'screaming', 'expletives', 'phone', 'face', 'anyone', 'who', 'Maisie', 'kindness', 'however', 'little', 'Maisie', 'shines', 'charm', 'vulnerability', 'yet', 'core', 'clearly', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'emotional', 'trainwreck', 'yet', 'sweet', 'relationship', 'bartender', 'Skarsgaard', 'whom', 'mother', 'then', 'marries', 'attempt', 'wrest', 'custody', 'ex', 'husband', 'best', 'moments', 'are', 'Skarsgaard', 'Maisie', 'are', 'sweet', 'tender', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'remake', 'say', 'Maisie', 'College-', 'mother', 'rehab', 'father', 'sixth', 'oh', 'too', 'young', 'wife', 'Skarsgaard', 'Maisie', 'do', 'cross', 'country', 'together', 'drop', 'off', 'college', 'somewhere', 'east', 'now', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'watching']",What Maisie Knew
