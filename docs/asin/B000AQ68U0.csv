After the exit of most of the cast from season one, the second year pales in comparison. The elegance and panache disappeared along with the presence of David Benzali and Patricia Clarkson who brought an element of human, family interest to the show. Stanley Tucci was impressive and totally believable as the X factor of the series.Donna Murphy, Dylan Baker and John Fleck were the engines that propelled this vehicle with class and provocative out front, edge of your seat watchability. As ahead of it's time this series was, it's sad that there has been little to equal it. In the second season, the leftover cast from year one was relegated to smaller, stiff, unfeeling roles and I must say that Mr. LaPaglia was merely triple A league compared to Benzali. The storylines were a major stretch and the resolution of each case were equally as hard to digest. I don't know what killed this series, but I believe what I saw presented in season two, had a lot to do with it. The excitement, anticipation and drama was missing as well as the heart of the show, it's great cast and the audience who missed them.",2,A Distant Second,1299369600,"03 6, 2011",2011,1188,"['will', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'exalting', 'merits', 'particular', 'drama', 'series', 'exit', 'most', 'cast', 'season', 'one', 'second', 'year', 'pales', 'comparison', 'elegance', 'panache', 'disappeared', 'presence', 'David', 'Benzali', 'Patricia', 'Clarkson', 'who', 'brought', 'element', 'human', 'family', 'interest', 'show', 'Stanley', 'Tucci', 'was', 'impressive', 'totally', 'believable', 'X', 'factor', 'series.Donna', 'Murphy', 'Dylan', 'Baker', 'John', 'Fleck', 'were', 'engines', 'propelled', 'vehicle', 'class', 'provocative', 'out', 'front', 'edge', 'seat', 'watchability', 'ahead', 'time', 'series', 'was', 'sad', 'been', 'little', 'equal', 'second', 'season', 'leftover', 'cast', 'year', 'one', 'was', 'relegated', 'smaller', 'stiff', 'unfeeling', 'roles', 'must', 'say', 'Mr.', 'LaPaglia', 'was', 'merely', 'triple', 'A', 'league', 'compared', 'Benzali', 'storylines', 'were', 'major', 'stretch', 'resolution', 'case', 'were', 'equally', 'as', 'hard', 'digest', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'killed', 'series', 'believe', 'what', 'saw', 'presented', 'season', 'two', 'had', 'lot', 'do', 'excitement', 'anticipation', 'drama', 'was', 'missing', 'as', 'well', 'heart', 'show', 'great', 'cast', 'audience', 'who', 'missed']",N/A
930694,A3IBYRSA490ZOA,B000AQ68U0,C. Chow,"[32, 40]","Thank you for setting me straight `Murder One' writer & producer Douglas Palau. I have since edited my review.When I say that the second season of `Murder One' is arguably the best season of drama in the history of television I say it as a qualified expert. A long time veteran of pretty much EVERY courtroom drama in the last 25 years, `LA Law', `Law & Order', `The Practice', exedra,  I can say that `Murder One' stands alone in a whole different universe of suspense.`Murder One' is so original that I can only compare it as a prelude to `24'.  It is the only show I've ever seen that even comes close to `Murder One'.Like `24' the production quality is like that of a major motion picture, not a weekly prime time drama. The acting also really stands out. To have a great leading actor like Anthony LaPaglia is good. To have an ENTIRE supporting cast as talented as LaPaglia is truly phenomenal!The other production talents also deserve credit. From the photography, editing, costumes, and set direction everything is perfect.Again like `24' there are truly stunning narrative hooks.LaPaglia stars as Jimmy Wilder, a sleazy LA Deputy District Attorney. Sleazy lawyers are the main stay of TV dramas, we've seen them 1000 times before. NOT LIKE JIMMY WILDER YOU HAVEN'T!Jimmy is denied a promotion to prosecute headlining crimes by the DA running for governor of California. The disgruntled Jimmy boasts, ""If you're elected governor I'll kiss your ass in a Macy's window."" Imagine Jimmy's shock when he hears on the news the next morning that the current governor has been assassinated. When he arrives for work he discovers that the assassin was caught fleeing the crime scene leaving her roommate's smoking gun behind. An angry lone nut whom had a brief affair with the late governor. No doubt she's guilty, she openly admits it.Jimmy is determined to be a part of this case that he was denied as prosecutor. So he agrees to represent the defendant for free, In spite of the overwhelming evidence! Jimmy uses every slime ball tactic he can't to free the assassin. But as the trial progresses he discovers a darker Oliver Stone size conspiracy behind the assassination. When witnesses approach him to sell testimony about the ""real killers"" he blows them off. That is until they start dropping dead, some right in the courtroom.`Murder One' originally began as a counter attack by ABC to the phenomenal success of NBC's `ER'. But unfortunately it fizzled and star Daniel Benzali left the show. It was resurrected for a second season where it also fizzled and was canceled. This is why few people heard of--and fewer saw `Murder One' when if first aired. A&E; did rerun both seasons one summer after it lost the rights to `Law & Order.' Hopefully now on DVD `Murder One' will get the respect it deserves like `24'.Another `24' similarity is that first season was ""worth watching"". But second season was truly the best television I've ever seen. The major flaw first season was that one murder trial was dragged out for the entire season. LaPaglia battles several murder cases and each trial is the perfect length. Nothing dragged out and nothing rushed.As pointed out by `Murder One' writer & producer Douglas Palau, here on Amazon, there is the erroneous rumor spreading that `Murder One' and `24' were made my the same people. After thoroughly researching the entire crews of both shows I failed to find any matching names. And yes Steven Bochco is credited with writing most episodes.Amazon error. FYI, Daniel Benzali does NOT appear second season. In fact his character is dismissed with only two sentences, ""When are we going to face it? Ted's not coming back.""  and, ""The only reason Neil Avedon got off was because Ted Hoffman pulled out a video tape at the last minute.""  (or words to that effect)",5,`24' Fans Take Note!
