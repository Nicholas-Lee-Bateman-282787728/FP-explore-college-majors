Irene Huss remains the same nose to the grindstone Swedish police detective we saw in season one, only carving out time for her family and her martial arts and even then certainly not in huge amounts. She just manages to keep her domestic life going but I think if her husband didn't work similarly insane hours as a chef at his own restaurant, that she would be on thinner ice with her family.This season we even see more of Irene's personal life as she has to handle matters with her daughters and keep her husband on course. But the fact that she has ANY personal life does give her the ability to empathize more with the crime victims in Sweden.Once again I find myself amazed that a tolerant, socialized, industrialized country like Sweden has such sordid crime and that so much of it has sexual underpinnings.  I would think in a country that pays all your medical, all your dental and will even put you through college and medical school for free, that the need for its residents to act out criminally would be greatly reduced. We discover, however, that Irene very much needs her gun and that the crimes she handles are every bit as sordid, violent and sexually deviant as they are in the USA.It is very hard to switch from watching this tv show to watching my own American crime shows, especially with such a realistic woman at the helm in the Swedish one.  I am now avidly hunting down European crime shows after watching all of Irene Huss and the Danish THE KILLING.",5,Just as Good as Season One,1311033600,"07 19, 2011",2011,1587,"['Sometimes', 'second', 'season', 'big', 'letdown', 'even', 'worse', 'there', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'here', 'Irene', 'Huss', 'same', 'nose', 'grindstone', 'Swedish', 'police', 'detective', 'saw', 'season', 'one', 'only', 'carving', 'out', 'time', 'family', 'martial', 'arts', 'even', 'then', 'certainly', 'not', 'huge', 'amounts', 'just', 'keep', 'domestic', 'life', 'going', 'think', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'similarly', 'insane', 'hours', 'chef', 'own', 'restaurant', 'would', 'be', 'thinner', 'ice', 'family.This', 'season', 'even', 'see', 'more', 'Irene', 'personal', 'life', 'handle', 'matters', 'daughters', 'keep', 'husband', 'course', 'fact', 'ANY', 'personal', 'life', 'give', 'ability', 'empathize', 'more', 'crime', 'victims', 'Sweden.Once', 'again', 'find', 'amazed', 'tolerant', 'socialized', 'industrialized', 'country', 'Sweden', 'such', 'sordid', 'crime', 'so', 'much', 'sexual', 'underpinnings', 'would', 'think', 'country', 'medical', 'dental', 'will', 'even', 'put', 'college', 'medical', 'school', 'free', 'need', 'residents', 'act', 'out', 'criminally', 'would', 'be', 'greatly', 'reduced', 'discover', 'however', 'Irene', 'very', 'much', 'gun', 'crimes', 'handles', 'are', 'bit', 'sordid', 'violent', 'sexually', 'deviant', 'are', 'USA.It', 'very', 'hard', 'switch', 'watching', 'tv', 'show', 'watching', 'own', 'American', 'crime', 'shows', 'especially', 'such', 'realistic', 'woman', 'helm', 'Swedish', 'one', 'am', 'now', 'avidly', 'hunting', 'down', 'European', 'crime', 'shows', 'watching', 'Irene', 'Huss', 'Danish', 'THE', 'KILLING']",N/A

I was so enthralled by the Wallasnder series that I wanted something more. I speak swedish (although I haven't talked it much recently and at first I had trouble catching what was being said. But eventually I began to understand better and I skipped the English subtitles which I found a distraction. (This review applies to the 1st Huss series as well.) Mrs Huss is a strikingly attractive woman solving very interesting crimes. She has the good fortune of having a crew of helpful associates. If you appreciate feminist viewpoints you will find something extra to enjoy with this dramatization. (Sweden has gone strongly pro feminist as can be seen from the Stig Larsson trilogy surprisingly entitled ""The girl with th dragon tattoo"" instead of the Swedish ""Men who hate women"" which sor of gives it away. This series has the same feel and settings as the Larson film and is just as interesting.",5,Fine detective work.,1353456000,"11 21, 2012",2012,964,"['was', 'directed', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'Wallander', 'series', 'was', 'so', 'enthralled', 'Wallasnder', 'series', 'wanted', 'something', 'more', 'speak', 'swedish', 'have', ""n't"", 'talked', 'much', 'recently', 'first', 'had', 'trouble', 'catching', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'eventually', 'began', 'understand', 'better', 'skipped', 'English', 'subtitles', 'found', 'distraction', 'review', '1st', 'Huss', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'Mrs', 'Huss', 'strikingly', 'attractive', 'woman', 'solving', 'very', 'interesting', 'crimes', 'good', 'fortune', 'having', 'crew', 'helpful', 'associates', 'appreciate', 'feminist', 'viewpoints', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'extra', 'enjoy', 'dramatization', 'Sweden', 'gone', 'strongly', 'pro', 'feminist', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'Stig', 'Larsson', 'trilogy', 'surprisingly', 'entitled', 'girl', 'th', 'dragon', 'tattoo', 'instead', 'Swedish', 'Men', 'who', 'hate', 'women', 'sor', 'away', 'series', 'same', 'feel', 'settings', 'Larson', 'film', 'just', 'interesting']",N/A

The acting is subtle and superb; the plots are inventive, and  it's general theme offers a twist to the usual ""capable-woman-in-a-'man's' world."" Irene Huss is unlike any other cinematic or literary woman detective I know of -- while not perfect, she's pretty well grounded and balances work, family, and personal time with great aplomb. Series II is a bit different from the original season. It offers more of an in-depth character analysis of Irene and greater insights into other major characters. However, to my mind, these benefits come at the cost of the action's tempo. Still, they're interesting and illuminating insights and offer a depth that Season 1 did not possess for me.
