It was made when Nelly released his second album and Sam Jones (who pulls a Sean Nelson and steals the show)stars on Smallville. While you can figure out the plot of the movie in the middle of it. An unexpected plot twist happens that isout of the blue. There is another twist in this movie that reflects real life, however it will spoil the plot of the movie, so I'll post a warning here for those that doesn't want the movie's twist given away.SPOILER....Dante Suarez has a cameo in this movie and much like Prolifick, whose mucis is never released to the public. Dante's album was never released when RCA dropped him from thier label. So this is the only time you get to see him ever.",5,Great Movie,1046995200,"03 7, 2003",2003,730,"['How', 'was', 'movie', 'not', 'released', 'now', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'Nelly', 'released', 'second', 'album', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'who', 'Sean', 'Nelson', 'show', 'Smallville', 'can', 'figure', 'out', 'plot', 'movie', 'middle', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'twist', 'isout', 'blue', 'twist', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'however', 'will', 'spoil', 'plot', 'movie', 'so', ""'ll"", 'post', 'warning', 'here', ""n't"", 'want', 'movie', 'twist', 'given', 'away.SPOILER', '.Dante', 'Suarez', 'cameo', 'movie', 'much', 'Prolifick', 'mucis', 'never', 'released', 'public', 'Dante', 'album', 'was', 'never', 'released', 'when', 'RCA', 'dropped', 'thier', 'label', 'only', 'time', 'get', 'see', 'ever']",Snipes

733161,A3OT8HDV03UV0U,B000083C8U,IhateMTV,"[2, 3]","First of all, I despise Nelly. I think he's one of the worst mainstream rappers out there. The man can't rap and this movie shows that he can't act either. I really don't understand why all the other reviewers praise him as one of the best rappers to act in a film (but then again, none of the other reviewers even bothered to mention Winter's brilliant acting, so what do they know?).I know that it sounds like I'm being unfair to Nelly just because I don't like his music, I actually tried the best I could to give him a chance. The fact is, the guy didn't show any emotion whatsoever, had the same exact facial expression throughout the entire movie, and used nothing but annoying slang words (which is really probably the writer's fault).The movie, however, really suprised me. After watching the first ten minutes, I was just about ready to shut it off (it seemed like just another steriotypical hood movie that uses a bunch of slang words that anyone who doesn't watch MTV or BET won't understand), but I'm glad that i stayed around. The plot turned out to be great, with lots of twists and suprising swerves.In my opinion, the best thing about this film was Dean Winters. I'm a huge fan of the hit HBO show Oz (His character, Ryan O'Reily, is actually my favorite prisoner on the show), and I only rented this because he was in it. Dean didn't disappoint either. He plays the arrogant, greedy, and selfish Bobby Starr perfectly. In fact, he's so good that it's almost impossible not to hate him. I'd also like to mention that there's a terrific deleted/extended scene with Bobby Starr and Johnnie Marandino, where Bobby furtherly tries to persuade Marandino to fund him for his rap company.Overall, Snipes was a suprisingly good film. I give it a 7/10.",3,Dean Winters saves this one.,1084579200,"05 15, 2004",2004,1759,"['First', 'despise', 'Nelly', 'think', 'one', 'worst', 'mainstream', 'rappers', 'out', 'there', 'man', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rap', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'either', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'other', 'reviewers', 'praise', 'one', 'best', 'rappers', 'act', 'film', 'then', 'again', 'none', 'other', 'reviewers', 'even', 'bothered', 'mention', 'Winter', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'what', 'do', 'know', '.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'being', 'unfair', 'Nelly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'music', 'actually', 'tried', 'best', 'could', 'give', 'chance', 'fact', 'guy', 'did', ""n't"", 'show', 'emotion', 'whatsoever', 'had', 'same', 'exact', 'facial', 'expression', 'entire', 'movie', 'used', 'nothing', 'annoying', 'slang', 'words', 'really', 'probably', 'writer', 'fault', '.The', 'movie', 'however', 'really', 'suprised', 'watching', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'ready', 'shut', 'off', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'steriotypical', 'hood', 'movie', 'bunch', 'slang', 'words', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'watch', 'MTV', 'BET', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', ""'m"", 'glad', 'i', 'stayed', 'around', 'plot', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'lots', 'twists', 'suprising', 'swerves.In', 'opinion', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'was', 'Dean', 'Winters', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'hit', 'HBO', 'show', 'Oz', 'character', 'Ryan', ""O'Reily"", 'actually', 'favorite', 'prisoner', 'show', 'only', 'rented', 'was', 'Dean', 'did', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'either', 'arrogant', 'greedy', 'selfish', 'Bobby', 'Starr', 'perfectly', 'fact', 'so', 'good', 'almost', 'impossible', 'not', 'hate', ""'d"", 'also', 'like', 'mention', 'terrific', 'deleted/extended', 'scene', 'Bobby', 'Starr', 'Johnnie', 'Marandino', 'where', 'Bobby', 'furtherly', 'persuade', 'Marandino', 'fund', 'rap', 'company.Overall', 'Snipes', 'was', 'suprisingly', 'good', 'film', 'give', '7/10']",Snipes

Why can't these guys get a clue that they just cannot act?  Ok, so maybe Nelly is the best out of the lot.  DMX doesn't even compare to him.Snipes is just a poorly directed and poorly acted film.  Sam Jones III is excellent, but besides him, everyone else fumbles through their lines.  The kid does have a future in movies unlike the rest of the actors.The entire concept seems to be derived straight from a B rap movie that has been made a thousand times before.  There are twists and turns that make you want to find out what happens in the end, but I was in no way biting my nails or on the edge of my seat.The directing was flat and led to a slow, slow pacing of the movie.  There was very little humor to fall back on.  It seemed as if the director couldn't figure out what sort of atmosphere he wanted to create.Snipes really didn't hold its own and I would not recommend it for any situation.  It's just a bad, bad movie.  2 Stars",2,Whoa Nelly,1047686400,"03 15, 2003",2003,1043,"['add', 'yet', 'attempt', 'rapper', 'enter', 'movie', 'industry', 'add', 'failure', 'Why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'guys', 'get', 'clue', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'act', 'Ok', 'so', 'maybe', 'Nelly', 'best', 'lot', 'DMX', ""n't"", 'even', 'compare', 'him.Snipes', 'just', 'poorly', 'directed', 'poorly', 'acted', 'film', 'Sam', 'Jones', 'III', 'excellent', 'everyone', 'else', 'fumbles', 'lines', 'kid', 'have', 'future', 'movies', 'rest', 'actors.The', 'entire', 'concept', 'be', 'derived', 'straight', 'B', 'rap', 'movie', 'been', 'made', 'thousand', 'times', 'before', 'are', 'twists', 'make', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'end', 'was', 'way', 'biting', 'nails', 'edge', 'seat.The', 'directing', 'was', 'flat', 'led', 'slow', 'slow', 'pacing', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'humor', 'fall', 'back', 'seemed', 'director', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'sort', 'atmosphere', 'wanted', 'create.Snipes', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'own', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'situation', 'just', 'bad', 'bad', 'movie', '2', 'Stars']",Snipes
