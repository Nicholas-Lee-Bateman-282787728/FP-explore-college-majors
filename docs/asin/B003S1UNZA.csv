1361261,A1LU7IIZ2MXLXX,B003S1UNZA,C. Cable,"[6, 7]","Congratulations, Ken Griffey Jr., You made the cover of The 10th Inning... and that's about it. The man who is arguably the greatest player of his era in light of the steroids scandal is talked about as much in a documentary covering the years 1992-2009 as Roberto Clemente, who died in 1972. In contrast, Barry Bonds hit 168 home runs from 2000-2002 and I'm reasonably sure Burns shows footage of every single one after spending 10 minutes talking about his childhood, college career, and early pro career in Pittsburgh.John Chancellor passed away in 1996 and is replaced as narrator by Keith David, which by itself gives this chapter a different feel than previous ones and it might take another viewing to adjust to the change. One thing that didn't change was Burns' obsession with beating particular topics HE cares about to death. After spending 2 chapters respectively bludgeoning us with ridiculous stories of Babe Ruth hitting balls into orbit and Satchel Paige throwing pitches that broke the sound barrier, 3/4 of this 4 hour installment is spent on Bonds, McGwire/Sosa and the Red Sox/Yankees rivalry.The only redeeming qualities of The Tenth Inning are the great coverage of the 2001 season in the wake of 9/11 and the interviews with Joe Torre, Pedro Martinez, Kieth Olbermann and a few others. Hopefully, Burns will make The 11th Inning worth waiting for, because this one fell short.",3,Not worth the 15 year wait,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",2010,1399,"['Congratulations', 'Ken', 'Griffey', 'Jr.', 'made', 'cover', '10th', 'Inning', 'man', 'who', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'player', 'era', 'light', 'steroids', 'scandal', 'talked', 'as', 'much', 'documentary', 'covering', 'years', '1992-2009', 'Roberto', 'Clemente', 'who', 'died', '1972', 'contrast', 'Barry', 'Bonds', 'hit', '168', 'home', 'runs', '2000-2002', ""'m"", 'reasonably', 'sure', 'Burns', 'footage', 'single', 'one', 'spending', '10', 'minutes', 'talking', 'childhood', 'college', 'career', 'early', 'pro', 'career', 'Pittsburgh.John', 'Chancellor', 'passed', 'away', '1996', 'replaced', 'narrator', 'Keith', 'David', 'chapter', 'different', 'feel', 'previous', 'ones', 'might', 'take', 'viewing', 'adjust', 'change', 'One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'was', 'Burns', 'obsession', 'beating', 'particular', 'topics', 'HE', 'death', 'spending', '2', 'chapters', 'respectively', 'bludgeoning', 'ridiculous', 'stories', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'hitting', 'balls', 'orbit', 'Satchel', 'Paige', 'throwing', 'pitches', 'broke', 'sound', 'barrier', '3/4', '4', 'hour', 'installment', 'spent', 'Bonds', 'McGwire/Sosa', 'Red', 'Sox/Yankees', 'only', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'are', 'great', 'coverage', '2001', 'season', 'wake', '9/11', 'interviews', 'Joe', 'Torre', 'Pedro', 'Martinez', 'Kieth', 'Olbermann', 'few', 'others', 'Hopefully', 'Burns', 'will', 'make', '11th', 'Inning', 'worth', 'waiting', 'one', 'fell', 'short']",N/A
1361262,A18YMFFJW974QS,B003S1UNZA,CKE,"[99, 115]","This will likely be an unpopular review, but I must be honest. ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"" does not hold a candle to the original series. While the ""Top of the Tenth"" is pretty good - ""The Bottom of the Tenth"" is essentially a retelling of the steroids controversy and the Yankee/Red Sox rivalry.  I will admit that these are the two biggest stories between 1999-2009 but it certainly is not the only stories -Things that were neglected- Only 10 seconds devoted to the White Sox World Series victory in 2005 breaking their 88 year drought between championships.- No mention of the Detroit Tigers - One of the most interesting stories of the decade was how the Tigers went from an 119 loss season in 2003 to a World Series appearance in 2006? The 2006 series between the Tigers/Cardinals was a rematch of the classic '68 Fall Classic - however, less than 5 seconds of the 2006 World Series is shown.- Never mentions the rise of Tampa Bay as a powerhouse- Excludes the Minnesota Twins.... and their stars Joe Mauer, Johnan Santana, or Justn Morneau. The Twins and Oakland A's of the 2000-2010 were the antithesis of the Yankees and Red Sox , and despite not winning a World Series they should be considered as two of the dominant teams.- No mention of Miguel Cabrera, Carl Crawford, Paul Konerko, Trevor Hoffman, Jim Thome, any of the Twins, or really any player who was unfortunate enough not to play on one of the coasts.- The only player interviewed is Pedro Martinez... which is a great choice... but why couldn't players be interviewed?- Why not have a segment on the announcers of the period... no Harey Caray, Ernie Harwell, Vin Scully, or Jack BuckWhile it is missing many key ingredients there are moments that help you remember the magic of Ken Burns. The highlight of the 4 hours is the McGwire/Sosa homerun chase of 1998. Burns is able to tell the story with passion and reminds us how exciting September 1998 really was. Burns also does a great job in the telling of the 1994 strike and the angst that it created. I certainly do not have an issue with the time spent on the Yankees (they are unquestionably the team of the period) but it seems like 50% of the time is devoted to the Yankees and their rivals ...the Red Sox. I agree with one of the over-riding themes of the documentary - this was an golden era for baseball, but why wasn't more time given to what truly made it a golden era?Final Verdict - Maybe my expectations were too high, but I can help but be disappointed in the amount of material that Ken Burns left out of the documentary. It is interesting but it is far from being the definitive documentary of this period... at least I hope so!2 1/2 stars",3,Not worthy of Ken Burns...,1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,2679,"['will', 'likely', 'be', 'unpopular', 'review', 'must', 'be', 'honest', 'Baseball', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'original', 'series', 'Top', 'Tenth', 'pretty', 'good', 'Bottom', 'Tenth', 'essentially', 'retelling', 'steroids', 'controversy', 'Yankee/Red', 'Sox', 'rivalry', 'will', 'admit', 'are', 'two', 'biggest', 'stories', '1999-2009', 'certainly', 'not', 'only', 'stories', '-Things', 'were', 'neglected-', 'Only', '10', 'seconds', 'devoted', 'White', 'Sox', 'World', 'Series', 'victory', '2005', 'breaking', '88', 'year', 'drought', 'championships.-', 'No', 'mention', 'Detroit', 'Tigers', 'One', 'most', 'interesting', 'stories', 'decade', 'was', 'how', 'Tigers', 'went', '119', 'loss', 'season', '2003', 'World', 'Series', 'appearance', '2006', '2006', 'series', 'Tigers/Cardinals', 'was', 'rematch', 'classic', 'Fall', 'Classic', 'however', 'less', '5', 'seconds', '2006', 'World', 'Series', 'shown.-', 'Never', 'rise', 'Tampa', 'Bay', 'powerhouse-', 'Excludes', 'Minnesota', 'Twins', 'stars', 'Joe', 'Mauer', 'Johnan', 'Santana', 'Justn', 'Morneau', 'Twins', 'Oakland', 'A', '2000-2010', 'were', 'antithesis', 'Yankees', 'Red', 'Sox', 'not', 'winning', 'World', 'Series', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'two', 'dominant', 'teams.-', 'mention', 'Miguel', 'Cabrera', 'Carl', 'Crawford', 'Paul', 'Konerko', 'Trevor', 'Hoffman', 'Jim', 'Thome', 'Twins', 'really', 'player', 'who', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'not', 'play', 'one', 'coasts.-', 'only', 'player', 'interviewed', 'Pedro', 'Martinez', 'great', 'choice', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'players', 'be', 'interviewed', 'Why', 'not', 'have', 'segment', 'announcers', 'period', 'Harey', 'Caray', 'Ernie', 'Harwell', 'Vin', 'Scully', 'Jack', 'missing', 'many', 'key', 'ingredients', 'are', 'moments', 'help', 'remember', 'magic', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'highlight', '4', 'hours', 'McGwire/Sosa', 'homerun', 'chase', '1998', 'Burns', 'able', 'tell', 'story', 'passion', 'how', 'exciting', 'September', '1998', 'really', 'was', 'Burns', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'telling', '1994', 'strike', 'angst', 'created', 'certainly', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'issue', 'time', 'spent', 'Yankees', 'are', 'unquestionably', 'team', 'period', '50', '%', 'time', 'devoted', 'Yankees', 'rivals', 'Red', 'Sox', 'agree', 'one', 'over-riding', 'themes', 'documentary', 'was', 'golden', 'era', 'baseball', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'time', 'given', 'what', 'truly', 'made', 'golden', 'era', 'Final', 'Verdict', 'Maybe', 'expectations', 'were', 'too', 'high', 'can', 'help', 'be', 'disappointed', 'amount', 'material', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'left', 'documentary', 'interesting', 'far', 'being', 'definitive', 'documentary', 'period', 'least', 'hope', 'so', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

I don't see why there are some low ratings because this dvd decided to showcase the best player in the era, that being Bonds but I understand.  Just goes to show you how much he is hated.  It's sad because it's just a game.  In the previous 9 innings, Burns devotes a whole inning on Babe Ruth, and rightfully so he was the player who changed everything. He also devoted a whole inning to Jackie Robinson, he also changed baseball forever. So he did the same thing with Bonds, which is respectable and honest. I like how they chose not to start out talking about the Bonds of the 2000's like many critics do, but Burns decides to talk about Bond's childhood and what America's racism and alcohol (which used to be in MLB dugouts back in the day) did to his dad, Bobby.  I like how they mentioned the Giants and Bonds of the 90's and how he basically kept the Giants in San Fransico.  The inning also brought back the Yanks and the Sox, 911, and the money in baseball and the new stadiums.  Of course the steroid era dominates the inning, and of course it leads back to many of those great players related to the juice including Bonds. It's ironic that the Giants cover guy was mentioning how long will it be till they win a World Series, when his prayers have been answered after the release of the DVD. I took 1 star off because Burns didn't have the guts to put Bonds on the cover (he shouldn't have covered so much on the guy if he wasn't going to put him on the cover), instead he put Griffey another great player in the era. He was only tainted by Astro-turf, those guys who created it also hurt the game. So it's a marketing tool, I understand!",4,Baseball Burns!!!,1292025600,"12 11, 2010",2010,1680,"['4', 'Stars', '10th', 'inning', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'are', 'low', 'ratings', 'dvd', 'decided', 'showcase', 'best', 'player', 'era', 'being', 'Bonds', 'understand', 'Just', 'show', 'how', 'much', 'hated', 'sad', 'just', 'game', 'previous', '9', 'innings', 'Burns', 'whole', 'inning', 'Babe', 'Ruth', 'rightfully', 'so', 'was', 'player', 'who', 'changed', 'everything', 'also', 'devoted', 'whole', 'inning', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'also', 'changed', 'baseball', 'forever', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Bonds', 'respectable', 'honest', 'like', 'how', 'chose', 'not', 'start', 'out', 'talking', 'Bonds', '2000', 'many', 'critics', 'do', 'Burns', 'talk', 'Bond', 'childhood', 'what', 'America', 'racism', 'alcohol', 'used', 'be', 'MLB', 'dugouts', 'back', 'day', 'did', 'dad', 'Bobby', 'like', 'how', 'mentioned', 'Giants', 'Bonds', '90', 'how', 'basically', 'kept', 'Giants', 'San', 'Fransico', 'inning', 'also', 'brought', 'back', 'Yanks', 'Sox', '911', 'money', 'baseball', 'new', 'stadiums', 'course', 'steroid', 'era', 'inning', 'course', 'back', 'many', 'great', 'players', 'related', 'juice', 'including', 'Bonds', 'ironic', 'Giants', 'cover', 'guy', 'was', 'mentioning', 'how', 'long', 'will', 'be', 'win', 'World', 'Series', 'when', 'prayers', 'have', 'been', 'answered', 'release', 'DVD', 'took', '1', 'star', 'Burns', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'guts', 'put', 'Bonds', 'cover', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'covered', 'so', 'much', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'put', 'cover', 'instead', 'put', 'Griffey', 'great', 'player', 'era', 'was', 'only', 'tainted', 'Astro-turf', 'guys', 'who', 'created', 'also', 'hurt', 'game', 'marketing', 'tool', 'understand']",N/A
1361265,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B003S1UNZA,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[15, 24]","I've had the Ken Burns 9-part (innings) documentary chroniclingthe history of what many call ""America's Favorite Past-Time""on DVD for about 8 years now and I still enjoy watching itfrom time to time. When it first aired on PBS back in thefall of 1994 (during the infamous strike!) , I reallythought it was brilliantly done and was a close secondto his other masterwork ""The Civil War"", which raisedthe bar as far as documentary / historical storytellingwith it's innovative mix of period music, photographs,film clips, newsreels and present day interviews witheither those who survived the particular era or whoare scholars & experts on the particular subject matter.BASEBALL is no exception, though it wasn't embraced theway ""Civil War"" was at first. It took a few years beforeit began to gain noteriety and appreciation from peoplewho may have missed it when it first aired.As of 2010, this whole documentary series is beingremastered, repackaged and re-marketed, for a veryaffordable price I may add, to a new generation ofbaseball fans, but this time with the long-anticipated""10th Inning"", which deals with what has happened inthe game (good and bad) from 1992 to the present day.I have heard so many good things about this addendumseries to the original that I was on the early pre-orderlist for it as soon as it came out.Of course, PBS and Ken Burns will air it all in it's entiretyduring the last week of September 2010 if you want to see itbefore you buy it. Again, if you like the way Ken Burnspresents his documentary series, and if you're a truefan of Baseball, you will enjoy the brand new re-mastered,restored, re-issued DVD version of the original BASEBALLalong with the ""10th Inning"" and 2 1/2 hrs of extrasadded in for good measure.As for me, I will just buy this individually to add tomy original 2002 DVD version since it plays & soundsjust fine to me.

The first half was pretty solid but the second half was just toooo focused on steroids and the Yankees and Red Sox. It almost came across as obsessive about New York and Boston....Geeesh. Below are just some random complaints and things that come to mind about this film01. There was no reason why they needed to spend so much time on the 2003 ALCS. It was worth mentioning how the Sox blew it and bounced back the following year but come on. That was wasted time.02. Almost nothing on the 2005 White Sox. The time they spent rambling on about the 2003 ALCS could have been relegated to discussing the White Sox winning their first WS since 1917. This ending ANOTHER drought that began a year before the Red Sox.03. The Phillies. They are a classic franchise that had only one World title under their belt until 2009. They were barely mentioned.04. During the introduction, the narrator said that the Brewers were the only team to switch major leagues. This is false. There were plenty of teams that switched major leagues. The Reds, Cardinals, Dodgers & Pirates were some of them.05. While steroids were certainly a subject that should have been covered, this film went on-and-on about it. I kept finding myself saying ""move on, we got it. Less talk about steroids, more talk about the teams.""06. Despite the advantage of high payroll teams, the 2000's had a colorful collection of teams winning pennants and World titles. A number of teams winning their first pennant and/or WS. While other teams won their first pennant or WS in years. This would have been good territory to cover instead of rambling on about steroids......And ho-hum.....the Yankees & Red Sox.07. I wish that Ken Burns would have produced this film with the same style and with the same narrator as the original series. I realize that Ken Burns has altered his style since 1994, but this film doesn't really seem to mesh well with the original series.

Last year I treated myself to the DVD boxed set and this year, I picked up his follow-up piece, ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"".This one deals with the modern game - specifically how the use of steroids affected the game, it's prized statistics that allowed us to compare players over different generations, and how they changed how we look at baseball in general. It is easily up there with Burns' best work.The research that went into ""The Tenth Inning"" must have been thorough because the results are a comprehensive analysis of the modern game with its performance enhancing drug use, ridiculous salaries, new 'retro' stadiums and MLB player contract disputes. It isn't all bad however. There's some marvelous detail on players who did it the right way and how good they made we baseball fans feel with the way they handled themselves as players and as men.Some highlights on these two DVSs include a recap of the McGuire/Sosa single season HR record, a brief comparison between Ken Griffey, Jr. and Barry Bonds, a nice profile of Ichiro Suzuki and his impact on the style of play by some winning teams, a tour of Fenway Park that's tucked in the Special Features section on the 1st of the two DVDs in this set - and these are all set to great background music throughout.The 2nd disc includes details the recent World Series title won by the Boston Red Sox and it is at turns funny as hell and also heartwarming. Based on what's revealed here, it could be the most publicly popular major sports title ever won by a professional team.

1361268,A1GAC8CMSTGINQ,B003S1UNZA,Joe H.,"[0, 3]","Is it possible to call something much anticipated that wasn't a certainty until 18 months before its release?  Well, I am.Ken Burns has made quite a name for himself over the last 20+ years and arguably his greatest work was the nine part ""Baseball"" released in 1994.  For me, an avid fan of the game, there is no argument.  ""Baseball"" successfully told the story of the game and made a star out of its greatest ambassador, Buck O'Neil, for which I'll be forever grateful of Burns.  The massive undertaking could have easily been a flop.  As long and expansive a documentary it is, it was destined to leave things out as Burns attempted to condense a century-plus into one feature.  Maybe there were criticisms at the time, it's hard to remember, but certainly over the past 16 years the work has become almost hallowed and flawless in the eyes of baseball fans.To say I was elated when Burns announced in early 2009 that a tenth inning was in the works would be a tragic understatement.  Of course, I was greatly disappointed to learn it would be over a year before the Tenth Inning would be completed but, as they say, good things come to those who wait.I'm going to go ahead and get it out of the way right now, but the biggest piece of criticism I have seen thus  far is that Burns, an avid Red Sox fan, spends too much time on his favorite team's triumph in 2004.  The Tenth Inning is two discs in length and comprises 240 minutes of content.  Burns spends almost exactly 20 minutes on the 2004 Red Sox, and 10 minutes on the 2003 ALCS loss to the Yankees.  Twenty minutes for the biggest on-field story of the past two decades seems about right to me.  And there is no doubt in my mind that if Burns wasn't an open Red Sox fan there would be little discussion of how much time is spent on that fateful October in 2004.  ESPN and the media in general have force-fed the general public Sox/Yanks and in the reaction to the coverage received some fans are taking out their frustrations on Ken Burns unjustly.In truth, none of us are truly capable of accurately saying how successful Burns is with Tenth Inning.  The material has not had enough time to sit and reveal what will be remembered about this era.  For the 90's, I think it's a bit clearer and Burns covers the big topics: The Strike, Griffey, the Braves, Yankees, the '98 home run race, and Bonds.  For the 2000 decade, there's the previously mentioned Sox triumph, as well as the 2001 post season, steroids, Pedro, Ichiro, Balco, the Mitchell Report, and more Bonds.There's little to quibble with.  I'm sure each fan will feel something is missing or wasn't covered enough.  I personally would have liked a few notes about the All Century Team and another chance to see that great footage of the game's greats gathered around an aging Ted Williams.  The feature is very light on the current stars but I think that approach is proper.  While Joe Mauer and Chase Utley could very well go down as some the best to play their position, we just don't know yet and if they do achieve such greatness their story will be told when all is said and done.  I suppose some time could have been given to Albert Pujols, since he's already cemented a good chunk of his legacy, and I would have liked to see something on the Hall of Fame and the infamous (and heart-breaking) snub of Buck O'Neil.  I also wish Burns had found a better story-teller for the Red Sox portion than disgraced former Globe columnist Mike Barnicle (was Peter Gammons not available?).Ultimately though, Ken Burns has accomplished what he set out to in providing a snap-shot of the past two decades and has created something every bit as good as his previous effort.  The Tenth Inning fits in seamlessly with the original nine installments and has, if nothing else, given everyone a great excuse to go back and re-watch the previous installments.  As is the case with most things, if you're already a fan of the previous works you'll find plenty to enjoy here.",5,"Don't Fall for the Backlash, Every bit as Good as the Previous 9",1287273600,"10 17, 2010",2010,3982,"['possible', 'call', 'something', 'much', 'anticipated', 'was', ""n't"", 'certainty', '18', 'months', 'release', 'Well', 'am.Ken', 'Burns', 'made', 'quite', 'name', 'last', '20+', 'years', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'work', 'was', 'nine', 'part', 'Baseball', 'released', '1994', 'avid', 'fan', 'game', 'argument', 'Baseball', 'successfully', 'told', 'story', 'game', 'made', 'star', 'greatest', 'ambassador', 'Buck', ""O'Neil"", ""'ll"", 'be', 'forever', 'grateful', 'Burns', 'massive', 'undertaking', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'flop', 'long', 'expansive', 'documentary', 'was', 'destined', 'leave', 'things', 'out', 'Burns', 'attempted', 'condense', 'century-plus', 'one', 'feature', 'Maybe', 'were', 'criticisms', 'time', 'hard', 'remember', 'certainly', 'past', '16', 'years', 'work', 'become', 'almost', 'hallowed', 'flawless', 'eyes', 'baseball', 'fans.To', 'say', 'was', 'elated', 'when', 'Burns', 'announced', 'early', '2009', 'tenth', 'inning', 'was', 'works', 'would', 'be', 'tragic', 'understatement', 'course', 'was', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'would', 'be', 'year', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'would', 'be', 'completed', 'say', 'good', 'things', 'come', 'who', 'wait.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'ahead', 'get', 'way', 'right', 'now', 'biggest', 'piece', 'criticism', 'have', 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'Burns', 'avid', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'favorite', 'team', 'triumph', '2004', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'two', 'discs', 'length', '240', 'minutes', 'content', 'Burns', 'almost', 'exactly', '20', 'minutes', '2004', 'Red', 'Sox', '10', 'minutes', '2003', 'ALCS', 'loss', 'Yankees', 'Twenty', 'minutes', 'biggest', 'on-field', 'story', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'about', 'right', 'doubt', 'mind', 'Burns', 'was', ""n't"", 'open', 'Red', 'Sox', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'discussion', 'how', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'fateful', 'October', '2004', 'ESPN', 'media', 'general', 'have', 'force-fed', 'general', 'public', 'Sox/Yanks', 'reaction', 'coverage', 'received', 'fans', 'are', 'taking', 'out', 'frustrations', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'unjustly.In', 'truth', 'none', 'are', 'truly', 'capable', 'accurately', 'saying', 'how', 'successful', 'Burns', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'material', 'not', 'had', 'enough', 'time', 'sit', 'reveal', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'era', '90', 'think', 'bit', 'clearer', 'Burns', 'big', 'topics', 'Strike', 'Griffey', 'Braves', 'Yankees', ""'98"", 'home', 'run', 'race', 'Bonds', '2000', 'decade', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'Sox', 'triumph', 'as', 'well', '2001', 'post', 'season', 'steroids', 'Pedro', 'Ichiro', 'Balco', 'Mitchell', 'Report', 'more', 'Bonds.There', 'little', 'quibble', ""'m"", 'sure', 'fan', 'will', 'feel', 'something', 'missing', 'was', ""n't"", 'covered', 'enough', 'personally', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'few', 'notes', 'All', 'Century', 'Team', 'chance', 'see', 'great', 'footage', 'game', 'greats', 'gathered', 'aging', 'Ted', 'Williams', 'feature', 'very', 'light', 'current', 'stars', 'think', 'approach', 'proper', 'Joe', 'Mauer', 'Chase', 'Utley', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'best', 'play', 'position', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'do', 'achieve', 'such', 'greatness', 'story', 'will', 'be', 'told', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'suppose', 'time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'Albert', 'Pujols', 'already', 'cemented', 'good', 'chunk', 'legacy', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'something', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'infamous', 'heart-breaking', 'snub', 'Buck', ""O'Neil"", 'also', 'wish', 'Burns', 'had', 'found', 'better', 'story-teller', 'Red', 'Sox', 'portion', 'disgraced', 'former', 'Globe', 'columnist', 'Mike', 'Barnicle', 'was', 'Peter', 'Gammons', 'not', 'available', '.Ultimately', 'Ken', 'Burns', 'accomplished', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'providing', 'snap-shot', 'past', 'two', 'decades', 'created', 'something', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'effort', 'Tenth', 'Inning', 'fits', 'seamlessly', 'original', 'nine', 'installments', 'nothing', 'else', 'given', 'everyone', 'great', 'excuse', 'go', 'back', 're-watch', 'previous', 'installments', 'case', 'most', 'things', ""'re"", 'already', 'fan', 'previous', ""'ll"", 'find', 'plenty', 'enjoy', 'here']",N/A

In a nutshell, this series centers around the evolution of Barry Bonds (his childhood, his father Bobby's influence in shaping him into the person he is, and how all of this is relevant to what is wrong with the game even to this day). Yes, a lot of things have happened to our game in the past 20 years, most of which are negative. However, this series manages to show the viewer how baseball continually manages to dig itself out of the holes it puts itself into time and time again. Whether it was the crippling strike of 1994 (which had no real substance), or the steroid problem that arguably started in order to help bring the game back to prominence (via home runs) after the strike, we're reminded that the game is human, and the players are just as flawed as the common folk. It was particularly refreshing to see the fans' revolt during and after the strike, and how they felt about the business and politics of baseball.Then along came Ripken's streak, and how it saved the game, as Cal Ripken had a wholesome image. In the end, the fans are in charge of the game, because without them, the sport wouldn't exist. I also like the stern stances that people like Bob Costas and Howard Bryant (the 2 stars of the show, in my opinion) take when referring to the steroids controversy. My favorite line of the series comes from Bob Costas: ""They didn't notice a damn thing when guys showed up looking like they had been inflated with bicycle pumps."" Also, Howard Bryant wasn't shy in expressing his disdain for Barry Bonds eclipsing Henry Aaron's home run record by saying that he didn't care, or he couldn't tell you where he was when the record was broken, or not having his son stay up to watch. One thing that is perplexing to me is the absence of mentioning the 2006 Tigers and 2005 White Sox. In 2006, the Tigers made it all the way to the World Series after losing 119 games just 3 years earlier. Furthermore, they were playing the Cardinals, who had Tony LaRussa as their manager, while the Tigers had Jim Leyland. One of those guys was going to become just the second manager in history to win a World Series in both leagues (Sparky Anderson was the first, who incidentally was the Tigers' manager in 1984 when he set the record). Also, the White Sox finally won a World Series after waiting 88 years......well sort of waited 88 years (they should've won in 1919, but we all know that story).I'm surprised that the producers of this series mentioned Albert Belle's corked bat incident, but not the above-mentioned stuff. What's so relevant about a teammate breaking into an umpire's locker to steal a corked bat? Was it to depict cheating in baseball? A snowballing into cheating in other areas of the game?  One thing that we do not want to overlook is the fact that this series will never be as enriching as the first, because were talking about only 20 years of baseball history. Overall, this series is still entertaining. I just wish that they had spent a little more time on what's relevant besides the steroids era, the strike, McGwire and Sosa, Joe Torre and the Yankees, and the Red Sox. 8/10",4,"Baseball, Burns, BALCO and Bonds",1295136000,"01 16, 2011",2011,3253,"['Tenth', 'Inning', ""n't"", 'anything', 'close', 'engrossing', 'nostalgic', 'enriching', 'series', '1994', 'great', 'moments', 'nonetheless', 'nutshell', 'series', 'evolution', 'Barry', 'Bonds', 'childhood', 'father', 'Bobby', 'influence', 'shaping', 'person', 'how', 'relevant', 'what', 'wrong', 'game', 'even', 'day', 'Yes', 'lot', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'game', 'past', '20', 'years', 'most', 'are', 'negative', 'However', 'series', 'show', 'viewer', 'how', 'baseball', 'continually', 'dig', 'holes', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'was', 'crippling', 'strike', '1994', 'had', 'real', 'substance', 'steroid', 'problem', 'arguably', 'started', 'order', 'help', 'bring', 'game', 'back', 'prominence', 'home', 'runs', 'strike', ""'re"", 'reminded', 'game', 'human', 'players', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'flawed', 'common', 'folk', 'was', 'particularly', 'refreshing', 'see', 'fans', 'revolt', 'strike', 'how', 'felt', 'business', 'politics', 'baseball.Then', 'came', 'Ripken', 'streak', 'how', 'saved', 'game', 'Cal', 'Ripken', 'had', 'wholesome', 'image', 'end', 'fans', 'are', 'charge', 'game', 'sport', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'also', 'stern', 'stances', 'people', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'Howard', 'Bryant', '2', 'stars', 'show', 'opinion', 'take', 'when', 'referring', 'steroids', 'controversy', 'favorite', 'line', 'series', 'Bob', 'Costas', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'damn', 'thing', 'when', 'guys', 'showed', 'up', 'looking', 'had', 'been', 'inflated', 'bicycle', 'pumps', 'Also', 'Howard', 'Bryant', 'was', ""n't"", 'shy', 'expressing', 'disdain', 'Barry', 'Bonds', 'eclipsing', 'Henry', 'Aaron', 'home', 'run', 'record', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'was', 'when', 'record', 'was', 'broken', 'not', 'having', 'son', 'stay', 'up', 'watch', 'One', 'thing', 'perplexing', 'absence', 'mentioning', '2006', 'Tigers', '2005', 'White', 'Sox', '2006', 'Tigers', 'made', 'way', 'World', 'Series', 'losing', '119', 'games', 'just', '3', 'years', 'earlier', 'Furthermore', 'were', 'playing', 'Cardinals', 'who', 'had', 'Tony', 'LaRussa', 'manager', 'Tigers', 'had', 'Jim', 'Leyland', 'One', 'guys', 'was', 'going', 'become', 'just', 'second', 'manager', 'history', 'win', 'World', 'Series', 'leagues', 'Sparky', 'Anderson', 'was', 'first', 'who', 'incidentally', 'was', 'Tigers', 'manager', '1984', 'when', 'set', 'record', 'Also', 'White', 'Sox', 'finally', 'won', 'World', 'Series', 'waiting', '88', 'years', 'well', 'sort', 'waited', '88', 'years', 'should', ""'ve"", 'won', '1919', 'know', 'story', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'producers', 'series', 'mentioned', 'Albert', 'Belle', 'corked', 'bat', 'incident', 'not', 'above-mentioned', 'stuff', 'What', 'so', 'relevant', 'teammate', 'breaking', 'umpire', 'locker', 'steal', 'corked', 'bat', 'Was', 'depict', 'cheating', 'baseball', 'snowballing', 'cheating', 'other', 'areas', 'game', 'One', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'want', 'overlook', 'fact', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'as', 'enriching', 'first', 'were', 'talking', 'only', '20', 'years', 'baseball', 'history', 'Overall', 'series', 'still', 'entertaining', 'just', 'wish', 'had', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'what', 'relevant', 'steroids', 'era', 'strike', 'McGwire', 'Sosa', 'Joe', 'Torre', 'Yankees', 'Red', 'Sox', '8/10']",N/A

Once again, filmographer Ken Burns is here to recap the key moments.What I like about this add-on to the original ""Baseball"" film series is the memories it stirs up.  Sure, it is biased towards the East Coast, but let's face it: so many of the seminal moments we all remember involve the Yankees, Red Sox, or other high-profile teams.  As a Minnesota Twins fan myself, I can freely admit this is the case, and still enjoyed this entire documentary immensely.  I relived the early days of the Yankee dynasty, that emotionally charged '01 World Series, the tragedies of the Steroid Era, and the pure spectacle of the '04 postseason (as well as much more).About the only thing that keeps this extension from drawing a five-star review is the change in tone of Burns from the original.  Instead of sounding like the impartial observer, Burns amps up the ""preachiness"" a little bit, really skewering steroid usage, and Barry Bonds in general.  I'm not saying he's wrong...I believe the exact same sort of things that he does.  But, I feel he lost a bit of impartiality and got just a little preachy at times.All in all, though, this is a worthy continuation of perhaps the greatest documentary series ever made.
