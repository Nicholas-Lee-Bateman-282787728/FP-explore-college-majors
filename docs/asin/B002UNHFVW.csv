And it's family approved by DOVE which means it's family rated. Although a live tree is being moved overland from the northwest to DC, it is not really the tree that makes this story, and the only thing Christmas about it is the lighting of a decorated tree at the end.It's another story about Father/Son relationships. But this is somewhat more realistic because it shows that sometimes Dad can be as wrong as son. And along the way, there is a beautiful lady friend for both to begin to love. Sound to sappy for the men, maybe not. There is the...well, I almost spoiled the viewing by beginning to explain some of the action on the road trip. Andrew McCarthy makes a realistic acting tree farmer dad, and Evan Williams does a good job at being the tech-savvy son. I even learned a new term (vlog)which for much younger folk, will wonder where I've been for years.My answer to the negative reaction to a teenager who doesn't always listen to his father is, ""reality.""
