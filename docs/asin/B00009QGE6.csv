757156,A21M7JSRRQFC0G,B00009QGE6,A On Amazon,"[9, 9]","This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. It is definitely one of those movies you can watch not just once. It is basically about some college guys rushing a fraternity and all of the events that happen while doing so. The main character's cousin really wants to get accepted into the fraternity and so the cousin ends up rushing with him. If you can appreciate movies like American Pie, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle and things of that category, you should see this movie. I wouldn't recommend if you don't like movies of the sort...it would be a waste of time for you. Yeah there are no high profile actors...except maybe Simon Rex but that shouldn't matter. All of the characters had a lot to offer and they all made the film as hilarious as this one. I would imagine this film would be a good choice of viewing for college students. I got it new for six dollars after watching it two times (first time coincidentally in a frat house).",4,It is actually funny...,1119830400,"06 27, 2005",2005,959,"['one', 'funniest', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'definitely', 'one', 'movies', 'can', 'watch', 'not', 'just', 'once', 'basically', 'college', 'guys', 'rushing', 'fraternity', 'events', 'happen', 'doing', 'so', 'main', 'character', 'cousin', 'really', 'get', 'accepted', 'fraternity', 'so', 'cousin', 'up', 'rushing', 'can', 'appreciate', 'movies', 'American', 'Pie', 'Harold', 'Kumar', 'Go', 'White', 'Castle', 'things', 'category', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movies', 'sort', 'would', 'be', 'waste', 'time', 'Yeah', 'are', 'high', 'profile', 'actors', 'maybe', 'Simon', 'Rex', 'should', ""n't"", 'matter', 'characters', 'had', 'lot', 'offer', 'made', 'film', 'as', 'hilarious', 'one', 'would', 'imagine', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'choice', 'viewing', 'college', 'students', 'got', 'new', 'six', 'dollars', 'watching', 'two', 'times', 'first', 'time', 'coincidentally', 'frat', 'house']",N/A

Its a skin flick alright, but from the male side. Love Susan Ward and a few others did a great job, but the film did not meet my expectations and just wasn't as funny as some reviews made it out to be. Jake is incredibly boring in the film.

757159,A2FDWH4W7Y151F,B00009QGE6,John La Rocca,"[3, 7]","This was a decent little movie.  It was very low budget, but like an early reviewer said it doesn't feel like it after you continue to watch it.  I almost turned it off in the first 15 minutes of the movie, but decided to stick it out.  The storyline of the two bullies of the Frat picking on the smaller pledger had me hooked and I wanted to see the bullies get theirs.There are some some actors many will recognized in this movie (Sherminator for one) who all did a good job.  The rest of the cast was pretty bad.  I took this as just like one of those USA &quot;Up All Night&quot; movies.  Its a &quot;American Pie/Animal House&quot; wannabee.Too much gross humor for me.  Those are cheap laughs.  I am starting to get tired of them and I everytime I see these movies I understand why the youth of America today doesn't truly know what funny is. Its sad.

The plot for this movie is a rehash of all the college and fraternity movies that have come before.  There is nothing truly special about this take on that genre of film.Understanding all of this and setting the appropriate expectations is the key to enjoying this movie.  Expect this movie to be crude, gross and a bit predictable.  Expect it to be low-brow and over-the-top, with bad dialogue at times.  This movie is rather funny and enjoyable in its own way.

Simon Rex was one of the best VJs in Mtv history, right up there with Jessie Camp and Alan Hunter. I don't think anyone was ready for the impact he would have on hollywood. His is a true entertainer that can go from hosting a show like total request live to giving an oscar level performance in a taxing role as a mean fraternity guy. I was in a fraternity in college and this movie is exactly what it was like. There is nothing stereotypical about this film at all. I'm sure all of us frat guys had to pleasure ourselves on a cookie and sing naked in the library. It's just part of being in a super cool fraternity. When I was a pledge, we did things like go to mcdonalds and order a whopper. McDonalds doesn't serve whoppers!Back to Simon Rex, he makes you hate his character to the point that you are yelling things at the TV and crying at how mean he is to the pledges. This is a movie you need to buy because you are seeing something similiar to Cruise in Risky Business or Macchio in the Outsiders. This is hollywood's next great actor in the role that will launch him to superstardom. As cool as Simon Rex is, he really doesn't even get within the galaxy that is my coolness.
