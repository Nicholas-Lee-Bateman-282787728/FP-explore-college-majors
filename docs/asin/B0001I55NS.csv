I've forgotten most of the book details but when I caught this movie on TV a day or so ago it was immediately obvious that a major rewrite of the contents had been done. I missed 20 minutes or so of this version but what I did see I think I liked better.I tuned in just as the team was about to go back and rescue the Professor and stayed through the rest of it. It seems to me that the book plot was an ongoing time travel program, not a freak opportunity like the movie, and- in my mind a flawed depiction of time travel by comparison. Crichton wrote something like each trip back was it's own reality then violated that plot by having his professor leave a message which shouldn't have been possible if reality changes when you travel. This plot cleans that up it seems and didn't have too many faults that I could see.Here apparently too many trips can be very unhealthy and a previous timetraveler (with too many of those trips) has remained behind (he was marooned without a marker(?) and decided to be one of the bad guys.Our heroes journey back with three or four unarmed marines and only one french speaker, the language guy and two marines promptly get killed by English invaders. The last(?) one- who was responsible for marooning bad guy is killed by him later. The set and costume detail looked very good to me, I didn't really have a problem with much of anything except that the whole story (the trip back, the Professors rescue and the return home)seemed to take place within only about 6 hours.It barely resembles the book which seems to offend some but Timeline is a pretty good way to spend a couple of hours.

His novels are usually two novels in one.  With TIMELINE, he spends a heck of a lot of time describing the quantum physics behind the time machine: cosmic foam, multi-universes, transcription errors.  It takes Crichton about 200 pages to describe all of this.  In the film, all of this is reduced to about 20 minutes.  The physics of the machine are reduced to a sort of &quot;Hey, it's a time machine and it works.&quot;  That's about all the quantum physics you're going to get in order to get in nearly an hour of battle sequences.The thick Irish (or Scotish?) accents are also difficult to understand at first, especially since these characters carry most of the background information you need to understand why the scientists are building a time machine in the first place.I would have been happy to settle for fewer battles and more explanation of the quantum mechanics in the beginning.  This is the true heart of the novel.  Without spending some time here, the movie just becomes a high-tech swashbuckler.  Also missing are the tensions and in-fighting of the executives of the technology company that built the machine.  Without this, the final sequence is denied any depth of meaning or irony.The DVD transfer is excellent.  The extras do go on a bit about the making of the movie. It turns into a sort-of &quot;let's pay endless homage to Richard Donner.&quot; The emphasis is on the technical side; the actors are not profiled in much depth.

All I've heard from fans of the book was that the adaptation directed by Richard Donner from a Jerry Maguire screenplay was just god awful. I would have to agree with them to a point. Timeline was very bad from beginning until the final half hour where a climactic siege battle between the British and the French saves the film from the awful pile.Timeline's premise of time-travel by way of some sort of ""faxing"" through a fixed wormhole sounds interesting enough. The theme of 20th-century people in the medieval France of the 14th-century also adds to the interesting story that supposed to have made Crichton's novel such a great read. But even having not read the book I thought the film was bad. The theme of strangers in a strange land was never fully explored and it seemed that each action sequence were there to only serve to keep the film from spiraling down into pure boredom. It didn't help that half of the main characters were wrongly cast. Paul Walker just didn't seem to belong in the film with his one-note performance as a surfer dude when he was suppose to be some sort of archaeology expert. Then add to that his love interest in the form of Frances O'Connor and things just get worse. The acting performances in the flm is salvaged by the work of Gerard Butler as Andre Marek whose chemistry with 14th-century French Lady Claire seemed very genuine. I think the film would've improved dramatically if they just concentrated on those two characters.Timeline does have one redeeming moment in its entire running time and that would be the battle in the end of the film. The French knights and men-at-arms besieging then storming the English fortification was genuinely action-filled. The technology and tactics used during the battle looked accurate enough to show just how brutal medieval warfare really was. From flaming arrows, night arrows and trebuchets with burning pitch, Timeline actually became entertaining.But a half hour of entertainment preceded by more than an hour of pure nonsense and boredom could only keep Timeline from becoming one of the true awful films of the last ten years. Maybe things would've been different if the screenplay followed abit more of the complexities of the book. Maybe if the casting of Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor never occurred and other more talented individuals would've raised the level of the film's overall quality. As a piece of mindless fun (well the final half hour at least), one can't do any worse with Timelines, but for fans of the book and more well-crafted filmmaking they should probably skip this film and seek entertainment somewhere else.",3,The climactic battle in the end salvages this film from the awful pile,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,2697,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'novel', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'fans', 'book', 'was', 'adaptation', 'directed', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'screenplay', 'was', 'just', 'god', 'awful', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'point', 'Timeline', 'was', 'very', 'bad', 'beginning', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'where', 'climactic', 'siege', 'battle', 'British', 'French', 'film', 'awful', 'pile.Timeline', 'premise', 'time-travel', 'way', 'sort', 'faxing', 'fixed', 'wormhole', 'sounds', 'interesting', 'enough', 'theme', '20th-century', 'people', 'medieval', 'France', '14th-century', 'also', 'interesting', 'story', 'supposed', 'have', 'made', 'Crichton', 'novel', 'great', 'read', 'even', 'having', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'bad', 'theme', 'strangers', 'strange', 'land', 'was', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'seemed', 'action', 'sequence', 'were', 'there', 'only', 'serve', 'keep', 'film', 'spiraling', 'down', 'pure', 'boredom', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'half', 'main', 'characters', 'were', 'wrongly', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'belong', 'film', 'one-note', 'performance', 'surfer', 'dude', 'when', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'sort', 'archaeology', 'expert', 'Then', 'add', 'love', 'interest', 'form', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'things', 'just', 'get', 'worse', 'acting', 'performances', 'flm', 'salvaged', 'work', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Andre', 'Marek', 'chemistry', '14th-century', 'French', 'Lady', 'Claire', 'seemed', 'very', 'genuine', 'think', 'film', 'would', ""'ve"", 'improved', 'dramatically', 'just', 'concentrated', 'two', 'characters.Timeline', 'have', 'one', 'redeeming', 'moment', 'entire', 'running', 'time', 'would', 'be', 'battle', 'end', 'film', 'French', 'knights', 'men-at-arms', 'besieging', 'then', 'storming', 'English', 'fortification', 'was', 'genuinely', 'action-filled', 'technology', 'tactics', 'used', 'battle', 'looked', 'accurate', 'enough', 'show', 'just', 'how', 'brutal', 'medieval', 'warfare', 'really', 'was', 'flaming', 'arrows', 'night', 'arrows', 'trebuchets', 'burning', 'pitch', 'Timeline', 'actually', 'became', 'half', 'hour', 'entertainment', 'preceded', 'more', 'hour', 'pure', 'nonsense', 'boredom', 'could', 'only', 'keep', 'Timeline', 'becoming', 'one', 'true', 'awful', 'films', 'last', 'ten', 'years', 'Maybe', 'things', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'different', 'screenplay', 'followed', 'abit', 'more', 'complexities', 'book', 'Maybe', 'casting', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'never', 'occurred', 'other', 'more', 'talented', 'individuals', 'would', ""'ve"", 'raised', 'level', 'film', 'overall', 'quality', 'piece', 'mindless', 'fun', 'well', 'final', 'half', 'hour', 'least', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'worse', 'Timelines', 'fans', 'book', 'more', 'well-crafted', 'filmmaking', 'should', 'probably', 'skip', 'film', 'seek', 'entertainment', 'somewhere', 'else']",N/A

806636,AHZJ4KTYBQ5KP,B0001I55NS,Avrohom Leichtling,"[0, 0]","Without regurgitating all the old canards about the problems posed by the tranposition of literary works to the screen, let's just say that this adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel is decent, if not overwhelmingly so. Coming as it does on the heels of LOTR I/II/III, practically any film based on a novel will fail the test - this one's no different.As popcorn entertainment, though, it's perfectly serviceable, if a little too compressed. Crichton's conundrum takes place over 36 hours, Richard Donner's adaptation reduces that to 6. The rest can easily be derived from that fundamental change. On the other hand, where Crichton needs time, literally, to describe life and the physical environment of the 14th century, a film can accomplish the same in an instant. LOTR (all three, for example) - in the original, verbal format, spends an inordinate amount of time describing things - places, the weather, emotive states, etc.Can anyone say with a straight face that the issue of &quot;acting&quot; should even be mentioned in such a film as this? Please, hang it up. I suspect the cognoscenti of science fiction film have come to &quot;expect&quot; everything will boggle the mind and the eyes. Sorry. This is a perfectly decent film of its kind. I would have preferred a lot more detail, and not nearly as much compression - but it's interesting that even so telescoped, the film still runs at 115 minutes. Think about it.Read the novel - see the film - then read the novel again. I don't expect my comic books to be the source of great revelatory anything - just plain, simple fun. Why, even the LOTR films had to cut the guts out of the original material - to get it down to 9.5 hours (theatrical versions).My only real problem with the film is the score - which is horrible. Poor Benny Herrmann and John Williams, good composers both, have been ripped off so many times now that all one has to do is to establish a characteristic syncopated martial ostinato, then play it to death.

His son Chris (Paul Walker) haunts the site mostly because his father's assistant, Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor) is there, and he is smitten. He acknowledges that he does not care much for history.Nearby, Robert Doniger (David Thewlis aka Remus Lupin in the Harry Potter series) runs a scientific laboratory that accidentally opened a worm-hole in space-time. They want to learn as much as they can about what's on the other end of the worm-hole, and give Professor Johnston a chance to go back to the time of the battle that destroyed the castle in order to find out. When he does not come back after two days, Kate, Chris, and several of Professor Johnston's other students go to the lab and demand answers.The lab is ready for them; they are to go back and rescue the professor. Most of the action therefore takes place in 1357 in the middle of a historic battle.Most stories about time travel make large efforts to avoid time paradoxes, but when a lens from the Professor's glasses and a note in his handwriting pleading for help are found in a chest which has been buried for some 600 years, we already know paradoxes are going to be involved. I tried very hard to keep track of them, but gave up when I realized that they were indeed going to change the course of history, and since they did indeed exist in the 20th century (21st?), apparently the changes were not of the sort to destroy us all.It's entertaining, but would be a great deal more so if I had paid attention in history and/or followed the things my Society for Creative Anachronisms friends told me about the weapons and warfare of the period.

They are transported back in time only hours before a pivotal battle between English and French forces is about to begin. While their initial desire is only to escape, as the hostilities progress they find themselves becoming involved in the conflict, choosing sides and ultimately playing an important role in determining the eventual outcome.Critique: The '03 release `Timeline' is an overall entertaining time travel/romance tale that relies on the audience interest in the characters rather than special effects to hold the viewers interest. Along with the time travel scenario there are also two love stories unfolding in this film, one between the professors son Chris (Paul Walker) and archeology student Kate (Frances O'Connor), the other between fellow time traveler Andre (Gerard Butler) and 14th century beauty Lady Claire (Anna Friel). It was the relationship and interplay between Butler and Friel that made the film for me. Without those two this film would've received -3 Stars- at best.

In Timeline, Michael Crichton sets up the basic premise that you can use some properties of quantum particles to travel between different worlds. A character explains this is based on some speculation or research by Richard Feynman, the world famous physicist and Nobel Laureate.Mathematically a positron can be explained as an electron moving backwards in time. This isn't necessarily how it works out in reality rather how it is described mathematically. Crichton uses this theory as the basis of his quantum time-travel gimmick to take the reader on a swashbuckling adventure back to the midst of the Hundred Years War in France, in the mid-1300's.When a professor of some import has disappeared back into this time, a rescue party is dispatched to retrieve him. One of the team is a modern archaeologist and a expert on the period who speaks Middle English and French.

Stewart ""Debussy & Sibelius Freak""","[7, 8]","This is actually 2 reviews blended as one; the first, the movie as a standalone film (disregarding the book), and the second, as an adaptation of the book.THE MOVIE:The movie was not very good. It moves quickly and is filled with action but suddenly dies half way through and grinds to a slow finish. They don't really take time to explain much, rather they press forward with the story and unsuccessfully try to allow the characters to explain important points as the film runs it's course.The story is creative and could be exciting. Archaeologists go back in time to the place they had been excavating. The man who is sponsoring the archaeological dig is a bad guy, someone seeking to make money off of the scientific find of the ages, time travel, even if it costs a few lives.The acting is OK, the direction is OK, the editing OK, the screenplay is horrible, and the costumes, landscapes, sets and period pieces are somewhat authentic although stylistic and cliche.  The battle scenes are poorly choreographed and not exciting.  The only thing of note that was accurate would be the siege engines.  That was done well.All-in-all, the movie is poor. It is an OK escape, a film that may be worth watching but which does little to add to the genre of action/adventure films. A below average outing.THE MOVIE AS AN ADAPTATION OF THE BOOK:This is where the movie really falls flat.If you read the book, don't expect much from the movie. Everything is changed. Characters, their motivations and fears, reasoning and abilities, strengths and weaknesses, relationships and interactions with each other, are all changed from the minute the film begins. A few good characters are completely dropped and several others are significantly changed from the book. The best character from the book, Andre Marek (played by Gerard Butler) is uninteresting at best.The plot, the scientific explanations of time travel (which the movie just explains was an accident), the historical figures, the confrontations and protagonists, are all different and lack the depth and richness they possessed in the book.  This was a pathetic attempt at adapting a book to film.The book, as usually is the case, was much better than the movie. I can accept that. The basic premise of the book is carried over; that is to say that ""based upon the novel by Michael Crichton"" is an accurate while also misleading description.  This movie just does not maintain any similarity to the book aside from the basic premise. It was very disappointing.I truly enjoyed the book and felt that it could have been better adapted. I don't know if Crichton (the writer of the book) was involved in the movie, but if this were an adaption of a book that I had written, I would be very unhappy with the hack job that Hollywood did on a novel that was well researched, well written and thick with character development, historical accuracy and suspense.MY RATING:So, to sum up; if you are looking for an adventure, set in medieval times, this may suffice as mindless entertainment.  As a standalone film, disregarding the book, the movie is a 2 or 3 out of 5, if I am generousAs an adaptation of the book, I would give this a 1 out of 5, very poorly done and extremely disappointing compared to a very good book.So, I arrive at an average rating of 2.

He hammed it up no end in The Last Samurai, and he does so here again.  There also seemed to be some serious continuity issues with his ever-changing beard-length!Anna Friel's music-hall comic French accent fails to convince, and the Canadian landscape simply doesn't look French.Worst of all though, is the sheer lack of WONDER generated by the time-travel sequences.  Maybe this is faithful to the book, in that the main characters have no time to explore and find themselves fighting for their lives as soon as they reach medieval France, but it all felt rather uninspiring to me.On the plus side, the battle sequences were competently executed,  the trebuchet siege machines being  genuinely impressive.

806655,A2BD0G4SRK0WMV,B0001I55NS,CodeMaster Talon,"[8, 10]","After reading the overwhelmingly negative critic reviews for ""Timeline"", I didn't want to go, but I got talked into it. And guess what? It was really stupid. But I have to admit I kinda liked it.Based on the book by Michael Crichton (from which significant details have been changed), ""Timeline"" stars Paul Walker, the poor-man's Keanu, as the son of Professor Johnston, a devoted archeologist who is working on a dig in France. Johnston has been receiving advice from a tech company based in New Mexico, who mysteriously seem to know just where to dig for all sorts of interesting finds. The professor gets suspicious, hops on a plane to New Mexico, and disappears. His son and some of the archeologists pay the tech company a visit, and are shocked to find that the Professor has gone back in time to the 14th century, and somehow managed to get himself lost in medieval France. They follow, and our story takes off.THE BAD: Okay, bad news first. Two words: Paul Walker. Oh man. His ""acting"" is beyond bad. When you consider the staggering amount of people who struggle in Hollywood, how does this maroon have a career? His performance is a giant void which sucks in all around him, including the normally good Frances O'Connor, who's terrible here. On the plus side though, if you get the DVD and watch the behind the scenes doc you'll see Walker behave like a complete jerk, on camera, when the cast pulls a practical joke on him. Heh heh.THE NOT-SO-BAD: Director Richard Donner (of Die Hard fame) is to be honestly commended for keeping it real, literally. Special effects are used sparingly; when we see thousand of flaming arrows hurtling threw the air in a battle scene, they are REAL arrows, not CGI. Ditto for fireballs and castles and all sorts of medieval coolness. The story itself is a bit tighter than a lot of Hollywood sci-fi, and the technology fairly feasible.THE ACTUALLY GOOD: Characters are usually a moot point in this type of film, but the wonderful romance between Marek (played by uber-hottie Gerard Butler) and Lady Claire (Anna Friel) is riveting. Watch her eyes when he insists on going back for his friends. Such a sweet, old-fashioned romance is rare in movies these days. Butler especially is one to watch, and along with his performance in the otherwise dreadful ""Tomb Raider 2"" proves he has the ability to be mesmerizing even when spouting the most ridiculous lines imaginable.AND IN CONCLUSION: Even though this is an action movie, ""Timeline"" has a decent amount of nuance and subtlety (largely due to Butler and Friel), even when fireballs are raining from the heavens. Fairly entertaining and occasionally exciting, it's worth the price of a rental. You can always laugh at it.GRADE: B-",3,"""People cared about each other then.

I was a bit disapointed by Frances O'Conner she was a bit too girly but it was not too bad.What I was most disapointed in was that I think it went too fast. Everything wrapped up just too quickly and the relationship between Merek and Claire just was sudden unlike in the book where they gradually grew to care for each other. The subplot of the abandoned traveller from the company that had made the machine was not at all developed as well as it should have been certainly not as menacing or as creepy as he was in the book. But becuase they changed the ""timeline"" (pun intended) from several days to only a few hours it all felt far too rushed and sometimes highly unlikely.However unlike one reviewer who seemed to think the battle sequences badly contrived the battles/fights were actually extremely well done with acurate armor, fighting and real life work siege weapons. My BF is a total history nut about this stuff and was really impressed and happy with all the costumes and battle sequences.But the cast was quite good and the film is still enjoyable.

806658,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B0001I55NS,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","This 2003 silver screen take on Michael Crichton's book of the same name begins with the mysterious and sudden appearance of a man in medeival dress, literally from out of the Dark Ages into the modern Soutwestern US where he collapses on a desert highway and is driven to a hospital by a passerby named Baker(Richard Donner) where he dies, and his body is signed out of the hospital by co-worker Frank Gordon(Neal McDonough). In due time, we will find the answer to why the dead man's organs and bone structure fail to properly align in the X-Ray photos. We learn his name was Vincent Taub (Jayson Merrill).Meanwhile, in an area of France known as Castlegard, archeology students and their Scottish professor, E.A. Johnston(Billy Connolly)are studying the ruins of a 14th century site. American-born Chris Johnston (Paul Walker) displays an occasional awkwardness in assisting his father as he teaches. We learn that the younger  Johnston is there not only to visit his father, but also to woo his father's pretty assistant, Kate Ericson (Frances O'Connor)--an undertaking his father discourages because he knows from personal experience that relationships between people of dissimilar interests tend to fail.What does hold Chris' interest is his friendship with the other Scottish academic, Andre Mareck (charismatically played by Gerard Butler).When Professor Johnston mysteriously disappears, physicist Steven Kramer (Matt Craven) finds evidence that the Professor has traveled back in time and is trapped there, Chris, Kate, Andre, Steven, and Francois Dontalle (Rossif Sutherland), travel to the International Technical Center in New Mexico, where Chris, Kate,Andre, Frank, Francois, and two of Frank's fellow ex-marines (Patrick Sabongui, and Mike Chute), step on the lab's time machine after being adequately prepped for their journey, and courtesy of a physicist with rather dubious intentions named Robert Doniger (David Thewlis)who collaborated with Professor Johnston on various projects, are transported back to 1357 Castlegard.Complications in bringing the time travelers home stem from their being plunked into the middle of the Hundred Years' War on one end, and because of the explosion of a modern weapon that should not have gone back in time causing damage to the machine on the other. The conflicts of interest between Doniger and Kramer add to the problems as well.Two of the time travelers are killed within minutes of their arrival; another is lost during an encounter with the arrogant Lord Oliver(Michael Sheen).Soon, they find the Professor, but Mareck's encounter with Lady Clare (Anna Friel), the sister of French General Lord Arnaut (Lambert Wilson), changes both his destiny and hers.Another encounter with Sir William De Kere(Marton Csokas), who  is intriguingly familiar with the group's history, makes the journey even more perilous.Chris is able to assist Kate when she uses her archeological skills to turn the tide of events on the night of the siege of Castlegard. For him, history has truly come alive, and happily, he is able to share this with the woman he loves.However this film may be panned by others, I found it to be an intriguing bit of sci-fi which evokes questions about loyalty, how far we would go on behalf of those we care about, and what we would do to change the bleakest situations in our favor.",3,An Interest in His Father's Work,1206835200,"03 30, 2008",2008,3352,"['2003', 'silver', 'screen', 'take', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'mysterious', 'sudden', 'appearance', 'man', 'medeival', 'dress', 'literally', 'Dark', 'Ages', 'modern', 'Soutwestern', 'US', 'where', 'desert', 'highway', 'driven', 'hospital', 'passerby', 'named', 'Baker', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'where', 'body', 'signed', 'hospital', 'co-worker', 'Frank', 'Gordon', 'Neal', 'McDonough', 'due', 'time', 'will', 'find', 'answer', 'why', 'dead', 'man', 'organs', 'bone', 'structure', 'fail', 'properly', 'align', 'X-Ray', 'photos', 'learn', 'name', 'was', 'Vincent', 'Taub', 'Jayson', 'Merrill', '.Meanwhile', 'area', 'France', 'known', 'Castlegard', 'archeology', 'students', 'Scottish', 'professor', 'E.A', 'Johnston', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'are', 'studying', 'ruins', '14th', 'century', 'site', 'American-born', 'Chris', 'Johnston', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'occasional', 'awkwardness', 'assisting', 'father', 'learn', 'younger', 'Johnston', 'there', 'not', 'only', 'visit', 'father', 'also', 'woo', 'father', 'pretty', 'assistant', 'Kate', 'Ericson', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'undertaking', 'father', 'personal', 'experience', 'people', 'dissimilar', 'interests', 'tend', 'fail.What', 'hold', 'Chris', 'interest', 'friendship', 'other', 'Scottish', 'academic', 'Andre', 'Mareck', 'charismatically', 'played', 'Gerard', 'Butler', '.When', 'Professor', 'Johnston', 'mysteriously', 'physicist', 'Steven', 'Kramer', 'Matt', 'Craven', 'evidence', 'Professor', 'traveled', 'back', 'time', 'trapped', 'there', 'Chris', 'Kate', 'Andre', 'Steven', 'Francois', 'Dontalle', 'Rossif', 'Sutherland', 'travel', 'International', 'Technical', 'Center', 'New', 'Mexico', 'where', 'Chris', 'Kate', 'Andre', 'Frank', 'Francois', 'two', 'Frank', 'fellow', 'ex-marines', 'Patrick', 'Sabongui', 'Mike', 'Chute', 'step', 'lab', 'time', 'machine', 'being', 'adequately', 'prepped', 'journey', 'courtesy', 'physicist', 'rather', 'dubious', 'intentions', 'named', 'Robert', 'Doniger', 'David', 'Thewlis', 'who', 'collaborated', 'Professor', 'Johnston', 'various', 'projects', 'are', 'transported', 'back', '1357', 'Castlegard.Complications', 'bringing', 'time', 'home', 'stem', 'being', 'plunked', 'middle', 'Hundred', 'Years', 'War', 'one', 'end', 'explosion', 'modern', 'weapon', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'causing', 'damage', 'machine', 'other', 'conflicts', 'interest', 'Doniger', 'Kramer', 'add', 'problems', 'well.Two', 'time', 'travelers', 'are', 'killed', 'minutes', 'arrival', 'lost', 'encounter', 'arrogant', 'Lord', 'Oliver', 'Michael', 'Sheen', '.Soon', 'find', 'Professor', 'Mareck', 'encounter', 'Lady', 'Clare', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'sister', 'French', 'General', 'Lord', 'Arnaut', 'Lambert', 'Wilson', 'destiny', 'encounter', 'Sir', 'William', 'De', 'Kere', 'Marton', 'Csokas', 'who', 'intriguingly', 'familiar', 'group', 'history', 'journey', 'even', 'more', 'perilous.Chris', 'able', 'assist', 'Kate', 'when', 'archeological', 'skills', 'turn', 'tide', 'events', 'night', 'siege', 'Castlegard', 'history', 'truly', 'come', 'alive', 'happily', 'able', 'share', 'woman', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'panned', 'others', 'found', 'be', 'intriguing', 'bit', 'sci-fi', 'questions', 'loyalty', 'how', 'far', 'would', 'go', 'behalf', 'care', 'what', 'would', 'do', 'change', 'bleakest', 'situations', 'favor']",N/A

This one is not a bad movie, but weak movie from another super Crichton book.  Maybe someday they will actually do a movie on the quality of Jurassic Park again!The premise is intriguing.  Point one, toss out the ""why factor"".  Any time you deal with time travel you run up against the reality questions, so if you like this sort of premise, dismiss the questioning process and it back and enjoy.  Forget it's a Crichton book and you might actually have fun with this film.  The movie little resembles the book, so forget the book.  Whoa that is a lot of forgetting to ask of an audience, but och, audiences were smart, they forgot this film quickly!The movie runs into all sorts of anachronisms - some of the most ridiculous sort.  It was hard to imagine these actors stood there uttering the nonsense.

Not a great movie.If you are going to compare it to the book then just forget watching this because you will be disappionted. If you watch this and like it and it gets you curious about the book, then don't wait. Get the book, its awesome!Back to the movie review:1) Action sequences were pretty good. The brief scenes showing the seige of La Roche was an interesting glimpse into medevil warfare2) The movie feels like a 3+ hr movie crammed into just 2hrs. This worked for some things (kept the action going and gave a sense of trying to fly through the pages of the book because I couldn't wait to see what happened next) but for other things (characterization and plot) it left something to be desired3) I liked seeing Paul Walker in something different than Fast & Furious. He seemed relaxed and not trying too hard. A likeable character.4) This is a movie...they forget the science and leave a lot of questions. They found a wormhole. How? Who cares. Deal with it. Read Crichton's PREY and you'll appreciate the brevity of this story's explaination.5) My wife who was totally ignorate to the book or the movie or Paul Walker thought it was a good watch.

Gerard Butler steals the film from lead Paul Walker in this loose adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel. In the film, archaeologists travel to medieval France in an attempt to rescue their leader, who is stuck there due to time travels gone awry. The time-travelers arrive in the middle of the medieval Hundred Years War at Castlegard, France.  Fantastic special effects are featured in nighttime battle scenes with medieval weaponry: flame throwing contraptions called trebuchet, night arrows, and flaming arrows. Exciting hand to hand combat and swordfighting between Andr&eacute; Marek (Butler) and DeKerre (Martin Csokas), French Lord Arnaut (Lambert Wilson) and English Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen) add to the suspense.

I'd say it largely failed as a movie, but had a few interesting parts for which it could be commended. The acting was marginal, at best. The photography wasn't bad, however. The story was, well, unbelievable. Let's break it into two parts. First involved the sci-fi mumbo-jumbo of time travel from the present back 600 years via someone's idea of a hokey time-travel machine. Just relax and throw away all your scientific background. Of course, they were having problems with the machine and one problem was they lost the good professor on the last trip back and now had to go on a rescue mission. Yaawwwnnnn!Well, they managed to get back 600 years only on the day of a major battle in the French-English 100-year war. Bad timing. Now we went into the second part of the movie and that was at a castle in Northern France which was about to engage in battle. Here, the costuming and set was actually rather good. The action was brisk and violent. There were a lot of brutal killings, but such killing was with clubs, swords and arrows. Remember, this took place 600 years ago. The main battle scene was actually quite interesting, particularly with the use of long-range ballistics (catapults), the high-tech weapon of the day. The hand to hand fighting was brutal and rather well done. In all this part, the time-travel crew faced a deadline in having to get back, if you believe in that drivel about time travel, and the reliability of their machine was in question because of a previous misuse. Yaawwwnnnn! Let's face it.

You know a movie is going to suck when Paul ""zero talent"" Walker is the best actor in the whole film.  I'm not kidding.  Walker has become one of my favorites in Hollywood simply due to his comedically bad acting in every single movie he's ever made.  And his acting skills blow every one else's away in this movie.  It's like they just picked a bunch of shmoes off the street and said, ""Hey guys, you're all going to star in this terrible movie called Timeline with Paul Walker.  Don't worry if you can't act, no one will notice because the movie's so bad anyways and they'll all be focused on the stupid dialogue and Paul's pathetic attempt to appear believable.

I won't go into all the terrible plot mistakes and innaccuracies, but my absolute favorite part of the movie occurs when some guys are attacking a castle at night with flaming arrows.  Nevermind the fact that flaming arrows aren't going to do much good against a stone castle.  Then the attacking general has a brilliant idea: ""Hmmm... they can see our arrows, since their on fire... maybe we shouldn't light them! Yeh! Then they'll be virtually invisible, since it's night and all!""  He even gives a name to this new, invincible weapon: Night Arrows!  What a brilliant strategic manuever!  His enemies don't stand a chance!  Then all his men applaud his genius as they proceed to decimate the castle with their night arrows.  I was speechless.  I've seen some great military strategy in movies, but nothing compares to this.So as you can see, not the best of movies.

With the tragic passing of Paul Walker, I decided to give his films a second glance and I was glad I did. While not an award winning film by any means, this sci-fi actioner does have its moments. Unlike previous reviewers, I have not read the book. Don't need to, the movie is fine on its own without all the technical gibber jabber to cloud my viewing experience. As a history buff, I found the premise exciting, but Michael Sheen chewing the scenery put a damper on that. The guy is only on screen for a few scenes, but he had me wanting to hurl a chair at him for what he did to poor Francois. But the actor is a chameleon and it shows.As for the other actors, Gerard Butler seems to have the most screen time and I don't know why. It' s an ensemble cast, yet the second half of the movie is devoted to him playing hero to some French damsel in distress. Yawn. There's not enough of Paul Walker in this and it's a shame. He plays the professor's son who has a crush on one of the assistants and that's all he does. He's wasted in the film and I don't think any of the other actors were given much to do except run around and act confused. It' s a real shame, because they can act. But you can take the film for what it is: a small sci-fi action/adventure with a promising premise of time travel and evil corporations and all that. The movie has way too many plot holes, such as the fact that time travel may scramble your DNA to the point where one more trip may mix up things permanently. OUCH!! Anyhoo, Paul Walker does an adequate job with what he was given, but it's really Butler's show and the film seemed better suited as an offering on the SYFY channel. Promising premise that gets lost in translation. Good to see the fine young man Paul was and nothing more.

Gerard Butler was fine in his role as was Anna Friel and Billy Connelly but the other two leads were awful.  Their subpar performances really killed any chance the movie had at capturing an audience.  The action is well done and the music adds a whole new dimension to the film.

806704,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001I55NS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 21]","When it comes to movies about time travel the one that serves as a bench mark for me is &quot;Somewhere in Time,&quot; where on the one hand you have the absolutely stupid idea that you can travel to the past by thinking yourself there, but on the other there are some memorable moments, such as the beginning when the old lady tells Christopher Reeves &quot;Come back to me,&quot; and the point where he discovers that Jane Seymour is smiling at him when the photograph that captivates him was taken way back when.  The great lesson I learned was that since time travel is impossible you are going to have to jump ahead to the willing suspension of disbelief for any of it to work at all and that ultimately the value of the film is if it has anything interesting to do with the idea of time travel.With &quot;Timeline,&quot; the 2003 film that director Richard Donner (&quot;Superman,&quot; &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;) made from Michael Crichton's novel, the suspension of disbelief is not that hard to manage.  Once upon a time there is a company that was trying to find a way to send three-dimensional faxes (i.e., a &quot;Star Trek&quot; transporter), and they discovered that they were sending packages to not just another time but another place, namely 14th century France.  We are told this is because there is a stable wormhole, at which point we nod our heads over that oxymoronic notion and look forward to what interesting things we get to do with this set up.What we get is the siege of a castle, held by the English, by a French army.  What we do not get is a real reason why this has to be part of a time travel movie.  The reasoning in the film is that the archeolgoist (Billy Connolly), who has been digging up the site in the present, has become stuck in the past, and his son (Paul Walker) and colleagues (Frances O'Connor and Gerard Butler) are sent back to help find him.  However, my suspicious mind thinks that maybe what happened was that Crichton had a time travel novel that was not going anywhere and a story about the siege of a 14th century castle that had no real purpose, and he threw the two of them together, because the sad fact is that &quot;Timeline&quot; just does not get those two halves to fit together (there is a marvelous metaphor for this early in the film where one time traveler has made too many trips and his spine and other key body parts do not match up perfectly anymore).My preference is for the castle siege part of the equation; a straightforward movie about a medieval siege would be pretty interested and Donner gets points for doing most of the fun stuff here without resorting to computerized effects.  But the assault keeps getting interrupted by the attempts of the time travelers to find each other and get themselves home.  Then there is the whole fear about changing the future, which seems rather moot because these people are so far beyond the butterfly effect stage that trying to get history back on track seems rather laughable.Of course this gets tied up with a romantic plotline when one of the time travelers falls for a young woman he meets, only to discover she is the one whose death marks the turning point of the battle.  At that point you know he is going to be able to have his cake and eat it too, and the question becomes whether this film can come up with a really neat way of carrying it off.  The short answer is &quot;No,&quot; it does not, and for those who are fans of time travel films the obvious comparison is going to be to &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (What if the U.S. had a nuclear powered aircraft carrier at the attack on Pearl Harbor?).  But then I am still trying to figure out why Walker is playing Connolly's son and not Butler given their accents, but then I also trying to understand why the trailers think that Walker and not Butler is the &quot;hero&quot; in this story.  Then again, if you could show this film to an audience in 1557 I bet they would be really impressed by how this one came out.",3,Just forget the time travel and start storming the castle,1082246400,"04 18, 2004",2004,4002,"['When', 'movies', 'time', 'travel', 'one', 'bench', 'mark', 'quot', 'Somewhere', 'Time', 'quot', 'where', 'one', 'hand', 'have', 'absolutely', 'stupid', 'idea', 'can', 'travel', 'past', 'thinking', 'there', 'other', 'are', 'memorable', 'moments', 'such', 'beginning', 'when', 'old', 'lady', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'quot', 'Come', 'back', 'quot', 'point', 'where', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'smiling', 'when', 'photograph', 'was', 'taken', 'way', 'back', 'when', 'great', 'lesson', 'learned', 'was', 'time', 'travel', 'impossible', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'jump', 'ahead', 'willing', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'work', 'ultimately', 'value', 'film', 'anything', 'interesting', 'do', 'idea', 'time', 'travel.With', 'quot', 'Timeline', 'quot', '2003', 'film', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'quot', 'Superman', 'quot', 'quot', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'quot', 'made', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'novel', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'not', 'that', 'manage', 'Once', 'time', 'company', 'was', 'trying', 'find', 'way', 'send', 'three-dimensional', 'faxes', 'i.e.', 'quot', 'Star', 'Trek', 'quot', 'transporter', 'discovered', 'were', 'sending', 'packages', 'not', 'just', 'time', 'place', 'namely', '14th', 'century', 'France', 'are', 'told', 'stable', 'wormhole', 'point', 'nod', 'heads', 'oxymoronic', 'notion', 'look', 'forward', 'what', 'interesting', 'things', 'get', 'do', 'set', 'get', 'siege', 'castle', 'held', 'English', 'French', 'army', 'What', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'real', 'reason', 'why', 'be', 'part', 'time', 'travel', 'movie', 'reasoning', 'film', 'archeolgoist', 'Billy', 'Connolly', 'who', 'been', 'digging', 'up', 'site', 'present', 'become', 'stuck', 'past', 'son', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'colleagues', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'help', 'find', 'However', 'suspicious', 'mind', 'maybe', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'Crichton', 'had', 'time', 'travel', 'novel', 'was', 'not', 'going', 'anywhere', 'story', 'siege', '14th', 'century', 'castle', 'had', 'real', 'purpose', 'threw', 'two', 'together', 'sad', 'fact', 'quot', 'Timeline', 'quot', 'just', 'not', 'get', 'two', 'halves', 'fit', 'together', 'marvelous', 'metaphor', 'early', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'time', 'traveler', 'made', 'too', 'many', 'trips', 'spine', 'other', 'key', 'body', 'parts', 'do', 'not', 'match', 'up', 'perfectly', 'anymore', '.My', 'preference', 'castle', 'siege', 'part', 'equation', 'straightforward', 'movie', 'medieval', 'siege', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'interested', 'Donner', 'points', 'doing', 'most', 'fun', 'stuff', 'here', 'resorting', 'computerized', 'effects', 'assault', 'getting', 'interrupted', 'attempts', 'time', 'travelers', 'find', 'other', 'get', 'home', 'Then', 'whole', 'fear', 'changing', 'future', 'rather', 'moot', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'butterfly', 'effect', 'stage', 'trying', 'get', 'history', 'back', 'track', 'rather', 'laughable.Of', 'course', 'tied', 'up', 'romantic', 'plotline', 'when', 'one', 'time', 'travelers', 'falls', 'young', 'woman', 'only', 'discover', 'one', 'death', 'turning', 'point', 'battle', 'point', 'know', 'going', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'cake', 'eat', 'too', 'question', 'film', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'really', 'neat', 'way', 'carrying', 'off', 'short', 'answer', 'quot', 'No', 'quot', 'not', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'time', 'travel', 'films', 'obvious', 'comparison', 'going', 'be', 'quot', 'Final', 'Countdown', 'quot', 'What', 'U.S.', 'had', 'nuclear', 'powered', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'then', 'am', 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'Walker', 'playing', 'Connolly', 'son', 'not', 'Butler', 'given', 'accents', 'then', 'also', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'trailers', 'think', 'Walker', 'not', 'Butler', 'quot', 'hero', 'quot', 'story', 'Then', 'again', 'could', 'show', 'film', 'audience', '1557', 'bet', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'impressed', 'how', 'one', 'came', 'out']",N/A
806705,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001I55NS,Lawyeraau,"[98, 109]","This film is based upon Michael Crichton's marvelous best selling book of the same name. When I first heard that a film was in the making, I was really looking forward to viewing it, as I absolutely loved the book. That it was in the theatres for just about the blink of an eye, however, gave me the idea something might be wrong with it. Having viewed it, I now fully understand why its sojourn in theatres was relatively brief.Unfortunately, the film bears little resemblance to the author's finely crafted time travel tale. Jeff Maguire, having written a screenplay that seeks the lowest common denominator, just about destroys the author's work, reducing it to an almost incomprehensible piece of drivel. The screenplay takes a five star book and turns into a film that barely rates three stars.Here, a young group of archaeologists and historians are excavating the ruins of a fourteenth century feudal town in France, which excavation is funded by  the International Technology Corp (ITC), a well-heeled, corporate giant. Some of the archeological finds are puzzling, as they seem to be anomalous to the time period. Moreover, the leader of the archaeological dig, Professor Johnson (Billy Connelly), has  suddenly headed back to the states to ITC headquarters, and they are unable to get in touch with him. They are then all summoned to ITC headquarters by Robert Doniger (David Thewlis), the head of  ITC.At ITC, they are told that the Professor has been transported by ITC back to fourteenth century France through a worm hole that ITC has inadvertently discovered. Unfortunately, the professor has not returned, and ITC wishes to send them back in time through the wormhole to help with the rescue of the Professor. It appears that their help is needed in order to navigate the intricacies of medieval life. One of them, Chris (Paul Walker), is the Professor's own son, so he needs no urging, Besides, he  has a crush on one of his colleagues, Kate (Frances O'Connor), who is also ready to roll. Another,  Andre Marek (Gerard Butler), is a romantic in love with a bygone time, and he. too, has no problem in going through the wormhole and landing in fourteenth century France.You know the screenplay is bad, however, when Francois, the only one who is reluctant to go through the wormhole, is told that he is needed because he is the only one who speaks French, as if the French spoken today were the same as that spoken in  fourteenth century medieval France! This would have been a line better left unsaid, as we all know that the French and English spoken today bear little resemblance to that spoken in early medieval times. It is a piece of information about which viewers always automatically suspend belief.Garbed in clothing that is constructed to resemble that which the people of the fourteenth century would wear and carrying  time travel markers that will enable them to return home, they go through the wormhole.  When our intrepid time travelers, led by ITC security chief Frank Gordon (Neal McDonough), arrive in fourteenth Century France, they are immediately set upon by a marauding bunch of armored English knights, wherein their ranks are immediately thinned. They proceed into the town, where their ranks are further thinned. There, they find the Professor, when they are auspiciously imprisoned with him. Kate, who has excellent climbing ability, manages to help them all escape. They then split up, with Marek, incurable romantic that he is, forging on in his own way to help the Lady Clare (Anna Friel), a French noble woman whose fate spurs Marek on to acts of great chivalry.They are all brought together for the historic battle between the English and the French over control of the town. There, the English are led by the ruthless and evil Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen), aided by a rogue knight named De Kere (Marton Csokas), who is really none other than a transplanted ITC employee. Marek finds himself fighting against the English in order to save the Lady Clare and makes a split second decision that will forever change his life.The production values in the film are excellent and the direction is fine, as it is directed by none other than Richard Donner (The Omen, Lethal Weapon, Superman). The battle over the town provides some terrific action scenes. The actors themselves are also fine. They all do their best with the little with which they have to work. In the leading man category, however, Paul Walker is bested by Gerard Butler who is engaging as the romantic hero, Andre Marek. In the leading lady category, Anna Friel shines as Lady Clare, besting Frances O'Connor. The problem is that their is little chemistry between Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor. There is, however, chemistry between Gerard Butler and Anna Friel.  Unfortunately, they are all done in by the simply dreadful screenplay for which Jeff Maguire should be flogged.If one rabidly enjoys medieval festivals and/or time travel stories, or if one loved the book upon which this film is based, then one will garner a modicum of enjoyment out of this film. If not, deduct one star from my rating. In any case, all who are inclined to see this film should rent, rather than buy, it.",3,THE BOOK WAS BETTER...WAY BETTER...,1083715200,"05 5, 2004",2004,5197,"['film', 'based', 'Michael', 'Crichton',

The writing was poor, the storyline was full of holes, and the dialogue was often unintentionally laughable.

Worst of all, though, this movie had me siding with the French in the big fight scene! Who the hell would ever WANT to take the side of the French in any fight? Sacre bleu!This movie will never win any awards, except maybe a Raspberry. And yet, I didn't hate it, mostly because of the cool medieval fight scenes.

806713,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,B0001I55NS,Martin Asiner,"[1, 3]","When Michael Chrichton's TIMELINE lit up the best seller list in 2002, he portrayed a world not unlike that of his earlier JURASSIC PARK.  In both texts, he transported an intrepid group of scientist-adventurers into a realm than both threatened them and uplifted them.  The film version of JURASSIC PARK managed to maintain this linked thread of danger and wonder, but in the case of TIMELINE, what director Richard Donner has done was to unlink this thread by eliminating both senses and substituting a messy soup of multiple points of view, none of which succeed in engaging the viewer.The primary problem had nothing to do with the usual trouble spot of time travel movies: the paradoxes inherent in changing the past to avoid a sure catastrophe.  What is at issue here is Donner's inability to present a tightly focused persona with whom the audience could connect.  There was no Sam Neill from JURASSIC PARK who could filter the many divergent viewpoints.  The relatively unknown Paul Johnston, with his surfer dude mode of speaking, simply lacks the gravitas to carry the film.  There were far too many scenes that made no sense.  I had trouble keeping up with identifying the armed knights as French or English.  And when the viewer cannot easily discern one set of potential antagonists from the other, then the director, by default, must rely on special effects to distract the viewer from the logical flaws large enough to steer a time machine through.The plot mirrors on a superficial level Chrichton's book. An evil scientist-industrialist accidentally creates a time tunnel that can open a portal to 14th century France.  Small groups of 20th century flunkies are whisked back to medieval times where they are stranded, one of whom is the father of the surfer-dude, who cleverly leaves behind some incriminating 600 year old clues to convince his beach boy son to lead a rescue mission.  If the director goes to the trouble of leading the audience to think that one character ought to be the lead, then that character ought to do so. Instead, surfer dude defaults his leader role to a variety of others, all of whom are infinitely more interesting.  There are several subplots that momentarily cause one to forget the lack of a central dramatic vision.  What emerges at the end is a time travel film that shouts out for a firmer hand that should have gripped the director's helm.  Donner was not the firm hand and TIMELINE suffers for that.",2,TIMELINE: Should Have Been Much Better,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",2004,2454,"['When', 'Michael', 'Chrichton', 'TIMELINE', 'lit', 'up', 'best', 'seller', 'list', '2002', 'portrayed', 'world', 'not', 'earlier', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'texts', 'transported', 'intrepid', 'group', 'scientist-adventurers', 'realm', 'threatened', 'uplifted', 'film', 'version', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'managed', 'maintain', 'linked', 'thread', 'danger', 'wonder', 'case', 'TIMELINE', 'what', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'done', 'was', 'unlink', 'thread', 'eliminating', 'senses', 'substituting', 'messy', 'soup', 'multiple', 'points', 'view', 'none', 'succeed', 'engaging', 'viewer.The', 'primary', 'problem', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'usual', 'trouble', 'spot', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'paradoxes', 'inherent', 'changing', 'past', 'avoid', 'sure', 'catastrophe', 'What', 'issue', 'here', 'Donner', 'inability', 'present', 'tightly', 'focused', 'persona', 'whom', 'audience', 'could', 'connect', 'was', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'JURASSIC', 'PARK', 'who', 'could', 'filter', 'many', 'divergent', 'viewpoints', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'Paul', 'Johnston', 'surfer', 'dude', 'mode', 'speaking', 'simply', 'gravitas', 'carry', 'film', 'were', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'made', 'sense', 'had', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'up', 'identifying', 'armed', 'knights', 'French', 'English', 'when', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'discern', 'one', 'set', 'potential', 'antagonists', 'other', 'then', 'director', 'default', 'must', 'rely', 'special', 'effects', 'distract', 'viewer', 'logical', 'flaws', 'large', 'enough', 'steer', 'time', 'machine', 'through.The', 'plot', 'mirrors', 'superficial', 'level', 'Chrichton', 'book', 'evil', 'scientist-industrialist', 'accidentally', 'time', 'tunnel', 'can', 'open', 'portal', '14th', 'century', 'France', 'Small', 'groups', '20th', 'century', 'flunkies', 'are', 'whisked', 'back', 'medieval', 'times', 'where', 'are', 'stranded', 'one', 'whom', 'father', 'surfer-dude', 'who', 'cleverly', 'leaves', 'incriminating', '600', 'year', 'old', 'clues', 'convince', 'beach', 'boy', 'son', 'lead', 'rescue', 'mission', 'director', 'trouble', 'leading', 'audience', 'think', 'one', 'character', 'ought', 'be', 'lead', 'then', 'character', 'ought', 'do', 'so', 'Instead', 'surfer', 'dude', 'defaults', 'leader', 'role', 'variety', 'others', 'whom', 'are', 'infinitely', 'more', 'interesting', 'are', 'several', 'subplots', 'momentarily', 'cause', 'one', 'forget', 'lack', 'central', 'dramatic', 'vision', 'What', 'end', 'time', 'travel', 'film', 'out', 'firmer', 'hand', 'should', 'have', 'gripped', 'director', 'helm', 'Donner', 'was', 'not', 'firm', 'hand', 'TIMELINE', 'suffers']",N/A

806720,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0001I55NS,Michael Butts,"[0, 0]","Richard Donner has given us some fine films at his helm:  LETHAL WEAPON series; THE OMEN; CONSPIRACY THEORY, and countless others.  TIMELINE will not be remembered as one of his best.  Based on Michael Crichton's excellent novel, TIMELINE tells the story of time travelers who venture back to 14th century France, to rescue a professor who is stranded there and needs help.  Of course, this experiment is top top secret, and when the time transporter is damaged by a hand grenade, we find our heroes may be trapped in the past.  Crichton's book was a wonderful blend of modern day technology and medieval derring do.  Donner sacrifices a little in the former and much in the latter.  The adventures in the medieval days are purely trite, and even the battle sequences, though vividly filmed, lack the power they so richly deserved.  Along with the script, the film suffers in other ways:  Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor (our supposed romantic heroic leads) pale in comparison to Gerard Butler (so good in DRACULA 2000) and the lovely Anna Friel.  Despite less screen time than the other couple, they generated true chemistry and were much more exciting.  Billy Connolly is miscast as the professor father; David Thewlis as the heartless head of the secret experiment isn't malevolent enough to create tension.  However, in supporting roles, doing nicely are Neil McDonough (Gordon); Michael Sheen (Oliver); and Ethan Embry (Josh).  TIMELINE needed to be in the hands of a true visionary director like Stephen Spielberg or a recklessly adventurous action director like Michael Bay.

Perhaps making a film about a group of archaeologists who time travel to fourteenth century France.The originality of this film is that it is so lacking in an original idea. We have been to this place before in the much more interesting and creative `Stargate'.  That film took us on a real adventure to a place where all Earth's history was born and where a force of evil spawned the early gods.In `Timeline' we get to visit a grimy pointless war at the close of the dark ages with a group of myopic and expendable characters.  What is the outcome? It is a predictable story that limps along to a forgone conclusion, a waste of talent and celluloid.What could be worse than that? Bad acting and worse writing is the answer and it is served to perfection in this oeuvre of trash.  The failure of the film begins with the writing and then segues into the lifeless direction. Richard Donner has never surpassed his pedestrian work on 1978's `Superman'. It all finally comes to a thudding stop at what is referred to as acting.Paul Walker is not an actor without talent. He was superb in ""Pleasantville"" and hit all the right notes in ""The Fast And The Furious"". Yet here he squanders his good looks and talent on bad writing and dull direction. Billy Connolly who was so brilliant in `Mrs. Brown' is the one of two who comes off with any grace in this misfire. The other who escapes with little damage is Gerard Butler who is always impressive. He takes some very bad dialog and improbable situations and turns them to his advantage.The high school senior year acting class honors however to to Francis O'Connor. Is it the writing that makes her so bad? Almost anyone would have a struggle with such howling lines to read. Perhaps it is a lack of experience. No, that can't be it. She has done some fine work in the past from `Mansfield Park' to `A.I.'. I finally figured out what bothered me so about her in `Timeline'. Its the strangest thing, almost spooky in fact, is the casting of this young actress who looks like she went to a plastic surgeon and asked to be made to look like a middle aged Barbara Hershey. This is what kept me riveted to the screen throughout the unfortunate experience. I was fascinated at the creepiness of the resemblance between the young Francis O'Connor and older and very preserved Miss Hershey.Now there is an idea for a science fiction film. An aging actress from the 60's has herself cloned so that her image may go on in films making bad choices and worse films for eternity. That is until someone from the past shows up in a time machine and puts an end to the endless dry rot. Come to think of it, has anyone seen Barbara Hershey lately?

I thought it was amazing, an absolute must-read. I waited until after I had finished the book to watch the movie, because I didn't want my mind tainted by a director's vision. I realize now that that director's vision needs contact lenses.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I don't know where to start.The first thing that's wrong is the intro scenes. The entire sequence of the man appearing in the road and dying at the hospital is completely rushed, and might as well not have been included in the film. The connection between the man and the dig at Castlegard is completely obliterated.Another thing that bothered me was the relationship between Chris and the professor, which is described as fatherly in the book, not as the professor actually BEING his father - a fabrication of the screenwriter. Kate isn't supposed to realize that Chris has any feelings for her, and Marek's character seems unlike the one described in the book. Another thing that's left out is a vital clue on the parchment, along with the professor's plea for help.Many of the characters are changed. Doniger is much older than described in the book, and Kramer has been transformed into a man. The character of Francios is an invention for the film, and totally unneccessary. A couple of military-types are added to the group that is sent back. In fact, there should only have been 5 people sent back - Kate, Chris, Marek, the man who set off the grenade, and the one who was beheaded (which should have been a woman, as in the book). They also conveniently have 14th century people speaking modern English as opposed to Occitan, like the book has it.There are so many things wrong with this movie, that it was hard to sit through. I only finished it because the friends I was watching it were eager to see it. It's as if someone cut-and-paste a dozen words from the book and told someone else to make a screenplay.

Donner wastes no time on the book's careful buildup to the journey back through time to Hundred Years' War France, and introduction to the technology, &quot;transcription errors,&quot; and the corporate Gates-clone who seeks to exploit time-travel as a high-tech business (&quot;Lost World&quot; redux).  Instead, we get a ticket to a rollercoaster, and a rickety one at that.Despite the retread themes, Crichton's book delves into both medieval technology and society which is actually interesting - it sounds good, at any rate.  Needless to say, there was character development.The film largly consists of a 90-minute chase scene through castles and forests, substituting English knights for dinosaurs.  The book emphasized the grace and speed of the better warriors; in &quot;Timeline&quot;, they are just as clunky as the knights in Monty Python's &quot;Holy Grail.&quot;  (About halfway through, I found myself wishing these guys would break out in a song while doing a witles stomp-dance on a table.)  And how the main quartet of characters maneuver skilfully through 14th century customs and language (a major theme in the book) is of course a complete mystery.Look for this turkey on the budget rack.

At first I thought this movie would be a total blow because Paul Walker was in it and it was all about him, but to my surprise the movie did not revolve around his character. The plot was something new (excluding the time-travel scenario) and I found myself enjoying the onscreen presence of Paul Walker but only because he was not the ""focus"" main character. The action was good as was special effects, the acting was alright on the Male actor's part (Mainly Gerard Butler). However, Frances O'Connor and the guy that plays Walker's father--- is lacking talent, they're characters were lacking in serious likability and personality. This movie is short since it revolves around a certain incident that occurred in 1357 and only major downside to this movie was that the would-be modern-day villain or rather anti-hero in the movie wasn't around long enough for you to actually hate him. I haven't read the book yet so I'm intrigued and want to read it. I recomend this movie to anyone who likes a good time-travel movie with a certain twist to it."" ----The year was: 2003 when I wrote this. When I first watched this movie, I was skeptic from the get-go. After learning of its exsistence throught a Gerad Butler website, I was almost excited, but then I watched the ""TIME MACHINE"" movie and while I enjoyed it, I was right tired of time travel movies and didn't want to see another one of them. The more and more my mother mentioned it was based on a Michale Crihton Novel I never heard of, I kept rolling my eyes and basicly knew the movie would suck because of one denominator. ""I'm so bad in 2F2F"" Paul Walker who couldn't act for scrap. When I watched it --- well it turned out to be a different story. I liked a lot. At one time. This is basically the aftermath of watching it 3 times.I'm a little less enthusiastic about movietized novels (except for LOTR) now and I'm beginning to see the flaws of the movie. And this was after I read the book when I borrowed it from the library. I gave it 3 stars at best, although I enjoyed it a lot more than I did the movie --- NOW anyway. I noticed that Richard Donner changed quite a bit within the existing storyline and the characters, and the editing for the movie was H-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. You could practically see where they deleted scenes out of the movie due to its tendancy to fly through every scene. One minute they're running and the next they're climbing over a wall and escaping the burning village. The entire primese of this movie was ""Everybody runs"" and that's just what they did. They ran and ran from the british. There was no time for explantions as to why everything in the movie was happening like it was, not enough time for Chritons famous complex explanations for everything he describes he in his books, and too much running throughout the entire movie. Even when they weren't running there wasn't enough of Chrihton's story to keep it interesting. For instance Professor Johnson or whatever his name was, was not Chris' father (although Chris did have a sort of romantic relationship with the female character Kate, but she never objected to it in the book and Chris wasn't oogling over her and bugging her about starting a RRS ""Romantic Relationship""), Gerard Butler's character Andre Marek ---I was currently watching YU-GI-OH! so the mention of the name made me laugh--- was more over indulged in the movie then he was in the book and was a bit too ""jumpy-jumpy"" about his love for the past for my tastes. Kate was all in all the annoying character in the movie. She was played out as though she were one of those ""I wanna do this my way"" type of woman, so she is constantly shown objecting to all the guy's plans of escape or commencement. The French character Francois, had a minor role in the book and didn't join the group on their trip to the past (thus enabling him from being killed). Richard Donner did a good job with the first 3 Lethal Weapon movies, but when it comes to full blown science fiction movies he better leave it to someone who has a little more experience in this area. The acting/dialogue is the run of the mill B-movie type. The only saving grace for this movie aside from Gerard Butler is former ""Xena's Warrior Princess"" actor Marton Csokas, who plays the rouge De Kare (all they were missing was Karl Urban). When the movie reaches its' end, the action consisting of the ""British vs. French amries"", its really lackluster and doesn't have the same flare as several other war battles before it. The end of the movie was a let down. So all in all this movie isn't what its cracked up to be to me anymore.

Along the way, they meet characters, form relationships, and discover secrets that will, ultimately, change the course of history. Or, will they?The synopsis is simple enough, but the story is far more complex and entertaining than a simple ""summing up"" can indicate. The cast is great; Gerard Butler's history-buff archeologist, Marek, is one of his best performances IMHO. British actress Anna Friel's French Lady Claire is also superb. The film moves quickly, keeping your interest, but not too quickly to sacrifice anything.Now, I mentioned that this was something like a time-travel twist on LotR; let me further refine that to say a time travel twist on the human, pre-defeat of Sauron world of LotR. In other words, the world is not the shiny white walls and delicate beauty of Rivendell, nor even the polished majesty of Gondor after Aragorn's return; this is more like the battle for Helm's Deep -- dark, gritty and not at all a perfect, idealized world...more like a 14th century, war-torn area would be.Finally, let me say this...people have complained that this was not as good as the book. It was not the *same* as the book, but I think far better. These characters are actually likable, and you have no compunction cheering for them. There is more to compel you to ""their side"" than the fact that they are the protagonists of the story. That said, most people I know who loved the book didn't like this, at least as a representation of the book. So, if you love the book and want to try this film, perhaps think of it as a different story. :)5/5 stars",5,A magnificent journey through time,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",2011,1845,"['Imagine', 'something', 'Time', 'Machine', 'book', 'twist', 'LotR', 'will', 'have', 'Timeline', 'mild', 'spoilers', 'movie', 'modern-day', 'set', 'archeologists', 'who', 'are', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'Castlegaurd', 'France', 'Hundred', 'Year', 'War', 'find', 'friend', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'sent', 'back', 'way', 'meet', 'characters', 'form', 'relationships', 'discover', 'secrets', 'will', 'ultimately', 'change', 'course', 'history', 'will', 'synopsis', 'simple', 'enough', 'story', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'entertaining', 'simple', 'summing', 'up', 'can', 'indicate', 'cast', 'great', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'history-buff', 'archeologist', 'Marek', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'IMHO', 'British', 'actress', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'French', 'Lady', 'Claire', 'also', 'superb', 'film', 'moves', 'quickly', 'keeping', 'interest', 'not', 'too', 'quickly', 'sacrifice', 'anything.Now', 'mentioned', 'was', 'something', 'time-travel', 'twist', 'LotR', 'let', 'further', 'refine', 'say', 'time', 'travel', 'twist', 'human', 'pre-defeat', 'Sauron', 'world', 'LotR', 'other', 'words', 'world', 'not', 'shiny', 'white', 'walls', 'delicate', 'beauty', 'Rivendell', 'even', 'polished', 'majesty', 'Gondor', 'Aragorn', 'return', 'more', 'battle', 'Helm', 'Deep', 'dark', 'gritty', 'not', 'perfect', 'idealized', 'world', 'more', '14th', 'century', 'war-torn', 'area', 'would', 'be.Finally', 'let', 'say', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'was', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'book', 'was', 'not', '*same*', 'book', 'think', 'far', 'better', 'characters', 'are', 'actually', 'likable', 'have', 'compunction', 'cheering', 'more', 'compel', 'side', 'fact', 'are', 'protagonists', 'story', 'said', 'most', 'people', 'know', 'who', 'loved', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'least', 'representation', 'book', 'So', 'love', 'book', 'want', 'try', 'film', 'perhaps', 'think', 'different', 'story', '5/5', 'stars']",N/A

806749,A38G64S5VMRI1P,B0001I55NS,Robert Graves,"[7, 9]","Because I loved this book so much I was expecting very little from the movie. That's how it generally works with Michael Crichton, and I've learned my lesson after Congo, Sphere, and Lost World, all great books and poor movies. And even with making such low demands on the film, it still topped them all. This is possibly Crichton's best novel and definitely the worst adaptation, maybe the worst adaptation of any popular fiction book ever.Timeline failed on every level in which a movie can fail. The acting was atrocious by just about everyone who had the misfortune to be involved, the adaptation is a shred of what the original story is, the dialogue sounded as though it were made up on the spot by the actors, the 14th century realism was on the level of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and the casting couldn't have been worse if you'd been trying. The whole movie had a low budget feel to it, producing a result I would've expected ten or fifteen years ago before audiences really cared.The movie (not the novel) is about several archeologist/graduate students who travel back in time to rescue their professor who's been trapped in 14th century France. They only have six hours to do it or else they're forever stuck there. Nobody can go back and rescue them after their six hours have expired, despite the fact that that's exactly what they are doing to the professor. Once they have journeyed back in time things start to go predictably wrong in the past and in the present. Using their knowledge of history, the archeology kids manipulate the armies of England and France while trying to fix various anachronisms they've introduced and not create new ones in the process. There's love, war, even unintentional comedy. What more could you ask for in a film?Answers below.1. Acting - I'm going to just say it: Paul Walker (Chris) is the worst male actor I've ever seen in a major-budget movie. Hands down. Worse than Keanu, worse than Vin Diesel. The only thing that helps him in this movie is Frances O'Connor (Katie) who is, amazingly, even worse. What makes it so unbearable is that the storyline keeps Paul and Frances together for most of the movie, so we get to see these two gems with no one else on screen to hide behind. In the spirit of honesty, I have to say that I've seen better acting in porn. I hope for the sake of film that Paul Walker isn't the flavor of the month long enough to ruin more potentially good films, not that Timeline is really in that category.2. Plot - The adaptation of Timeline drastically departed from Crichton's novel and in all the wrong directions. I realize that certain aspects must be changed from a book to make the movie work, but there's a certain point at which the story can become so severely mangled that any reason for the story existing in the first place is gone. That's what happened to Timeline. Why was Timeline a huge bestselling novel? Because it was the first technically plausible time-travel story that we'd ever read. It combined detailed fact with fiction in the seamless way only Crichton can do it. And it painted a realistic picture of how such technology might be exploited if they were developed. Without that, it's just another brainless sci-fi story. Now here's the point - *none of those things made it into the movie!* That's what made it great, and none of it's there. The result is a convoluted mess that is hard to follow even if you know the rough storyline.3. Realism - Director Richard Donnor made it a point in an interview to state that he was going to favor actual sets instead of special effects. I'm all for this generally - if you're actually going to put some work and money into it. One problem that epics such as Braveheart and Lord of the Rings have created is that half-hearted offerings such as Timeline are pallid and limp next to them. Half a dozen English soldiers clumsily drawing their swords while dramatic music plays just isn't going to cut it. Nor are ""night arrows,"" which, though I'm not a history expert, I'm pretty certain never existed as a legitimate military threat, certainly not on the cunning level of warfare mastery with which they are depicted in Timeline. And the ""If we don't leave it here then we'll never find it in the future!"" moments give me another reason to cite Bill and Ted as a comparison.If Michael Crichton wants a good movie made out of one of his books, apparently he's going to have to write the screenplay himself as he did with Jurassic Park. I understand that he pioneered a new kind of contract with Timeline, accepting a percentage of the Box Office in lieu of a set dollar amount. I have to wonder how he felt about that decision after seeing the first cut of this epic disaster.",1,Night Arrows!,1081036800,"04 4, 2004",2004,4730,"['loved', 'book', 'so', 'much', 'was',

But when they arrive, they discover that the era they have entered is a violent, tumultuous one, and they quickly lose control of their mission and are swept into the violent world around them.  More would be telling, but this is a pretty good yarn.  It also avoids most of the pitfalls of other time travel stories, i.e. the paradoxes and the incredulity that arises from them.The book did an incomparably better job explaining the time travel technology (in Crichton's peerless fashion) than did the movie, which I thought gave this component of the story short shrift.  However, the book got pretty bogged down about midway through, while the movie maintained better continuity of story.  Further, I thought the movie ending was incomparably better than that of the book, and was in fact beautifully done.The special effects in the movie are not bad either.  The catapults, the Greek Fire, and the battle scenes were very well done, and quite realistic.  They managed to convey the central concept of the story--that this was a violent place and time, a time of war and conquest.  I thought that the acting was pretty OK, if not exceptional.Overall, quite a good movie; one that I'll watch more than once.",4,Quite good--and a better ending than the book.,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",2004,1797,"['movie', 'been', 'panned', 'quite', 'few', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'purists', 'Well', ""'m"", 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'fan', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'Not', 'perfect', 'then', 'again', 'was', 'book', 'very', 'thought-provoking', 'most', 'Crichton', 'science', 'fiction', 'novels', 'skillful', 'use', 'science', 'scientific', 'speculation.The', 'story', 'simple', 'enough', 'spoilers', 'here', 'limited', 'form', 'time', 'travel', 'accidentally', 'been', 'discovered', 'leading', 'scientist', 'become', 'trapped', 'past', 'specifically', 'A.D.', '1357', 'France', 'A', 'rescue', 'team', 'formed', 'go', 'back', 'get', 'when', 'arrive', 'discover', 'era', 'have', 'entered', 'violent', 'tumultuous', 'one', 'quickly', 'lose', 'control', 'mission', 'are', 'swept', 'violent', 'world', 'More', 'would', 'be', 'telling', 'pretty', 'good', 'yarn', 'also', 'most', 'pitfalls', 'other', 'time', 'travel', 'stories', 'i.e', 'paradoxes', 'incredulity', 'them.The', 'book', 'did', 'incomparably', 'better', 'job', 'explaining', 'time', 'travel', 'technology', 'Crichton', 'peerless', 'fashion', 'did', 'movie', 'thought', 'gave', 'component', 'story', 'short', 'shrift', 'However', 'book', 'got', 'pretty', 'bogged', 'down', 'about', 'midway', 'movie', 'maintained', 'better', 'continuity', 'story', 'Further', 'thought', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'incomparably', 'better', 'book', 'was', 'fact', 'beautifully', 'done.The', 'special', 'effects', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'catapults', 'Greek', 'Fire', 'battle', 'scenes', 'were', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'quite', 'realistic', 'managed', 'convey', 'central', 'concept', 'story', 'was', 'violent', 'place', 'time', 'time', 'war', 'conquest', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'OK', 'not', 'exceptional.Overall', 'quite', 'good', 'movie', 'one', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'more', 'once']",N/A

Zwick,"[0, 0]","Ever had one of those crazy dreams (probably after you've made one too many trips to the salad bar at Medieval Times) where you suddenly find yourself back in the year 1357, holing up in a French castle while all around you French and British forces are enacting the Hundred Years' War?  If you have, it was probably more interesting than what we see in ""Timeline"" - and if you haven't, I am sure you could come up with a more convincing and intriguing scenario than the makers of this film have devised with the same material.  Though based on a Michael Crichton novel, ""Timeline"" is about as bad a sci-fi fantasy as anyone could ever possibly imagine.  In this time-tripping tale told by an idiot, a group of modern-day archaeologists in France are transported through a ""wormhole"" to 14th Century Europe to help retrieve the leader of their dig who has (don't ask how) become stuck in the past.Time-travel yarns require a certain intelligence and finesse to make them both intriguing and convincing.  ""Timeline"" is ludicrous from the very outset, for less than five minutes after our intrepid little heroes first learn of the existence of the way-back machine, they are all suited up in their Medieval garb and heading back in time, utterly unprepared for what they might find there.  Once they get to their destination, the plot bogs down in endless scenes of armored men on horseback a-hacking and a-hewing away at the anachronistic visitors.  I mean, whose bright idea was it to set up this time machine premise and then send the characters not forward into a potentially interesting future but BACKWARDS to take part in a creaky, hackneyed Medieval romance?  It's one thing to set up this time-bending scenario; it's quite another to do absolutely nothing with it.  Oh sure, there's the usual deep-think palaver about whether or not these folks from the future should risk tampering with history etc., but the filmmakers' sights seem to be set on more mundane matters like elaborate action and fight sequences and puppy-love romance.  And, of course, all these archaeologists turn out to be expert swords- and bowmen, fully the equal in skill and talent to their 14th Century brethren.  On the whole, the acting is amateurish, the dialogue inane and the special effects virtually nonexistent for a film of this type.  The film, in fact, both looks and feels like a third-rate, throwaway project designed for no purpose other than to give Paramount Studios a corporate-loss write-off come tax time.""Timeline"" is like H.G.

After all, I've given one star to House of the Dead and this isn't nearly that level of dreck. I probably wouldn't have disliked 'Timeline' so much if I wasn't positive that there wasn't a better movie buried in here. The problems abound, however, and there are unresolved issues pretty much across the board.The script is an absolute mess. Especially in a time-travel movie, when you create a set if rules for the science of your film, you HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM. For example, it's commented in the beginning of the film that no modern weaponry can make the leap back. OK, the technology hadn't been invented yet, that makes sense. So what do we see not ten minutes later ... a grenade? I'm not even going to mention how the ending of Merrick's character should have completely changed the future or the way a team of archeologists would so recklessly think nothing of interfering with the past. When writing this kind of a script, a screen-writer HAS to follow the rules he sets for himself.I also never did come to understand why 3 or 4 people had to get killed going back to save a 70 year old man. Why exactly was he so important that you couldn't just leave him there? There were also a great number of characters were only developed half-way. I'm thinking, in particular, of every employee in the corporation that built the time machine. It seemed like there was more going on there that we, as an audience, were filled in on.The set design is poor. I couldn't have put it better when another reviewer stated that the film looked like it was made on the back-lot of Monty-Python's Holy Grail. Everything just looked like it was made of cardboard.Speaking of cardboard, the acting's awful. He seems to be my new whipping boy, but I'll say it again ... PAUL WALKER CANNOT ACT. He HAS to be the worst actor of the modern era. He CANNOT carry and headline a film, he doesn't have the ability. Other then that the cast list was pretty well loaded with talent that was never cultivated properly.The directing was lazy. I'm normally a big Richard Donner fan. There have only been a handful of movies he's done that I really think were stinkers. Unfortunately, this is one of them. His resume is too loaded with great films to think that this was anything other then a hiccup. I'm not letting him off the hook either though. He had a TON of resources at his disposal and just couldn't bring ANY of it together.The time and money that were pumped into `Timeline' really should have made for a better product then we were ultimately going to get. I'm instead left with the feeling that I'd be more inclined to just go watch `Braveheart' again.",1,There's a much better film in here somewhere ...,1128556800,"10 6, 2005",2005,2688,"['Maybe', 'one', 'half', 'stars', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'accurate', ""'ve"", 'given', 'one', 'star', 'House', 'Dead', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'level', 'dreck', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'disliked', ""'Timeline"", 'so', 'much', 'was', ""n't"", 'positive', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'movie', 'buried', 'here', 'problems', 'abound', 'however', 'are', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'pretty', 'much', 'board.The', 'script', 'absolute', 'mess', 'Especially', 'time-travel', 'movie', 'when', 'create', 'set', 'rules', 'science', 'film', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'FOLLOW', 'THEM', 'example', 'commented', 'beginning', 'film', 'modern', 'weaponry', 'can', 'make', 'leap', 'back', 'OK', 'technology', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'invented', 'yet', 'sense', 'So', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'not', 'ten', 'minutes', 'later', 'grenade', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'going', 'mention', 'how', 'ending', 'Merrick', 'character', 'should', 'have', 'completely', 'changed', 'future', 'way', 'team', 'archeologists', 'would', 'so', 'recklessly', 'think', 'nothing', 'interfering', 'past', 'When', 'writing', 'kind', 'script', 'screen-writer', 'HAS', 'follow', 'rules', 'himself.I', 'also', 'never', 'did', 'come', 'understand', 'why', '3', '4', 'people', 'had', 'get', 'killed', 'going', 'back', 'save', '70', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'Why', 'exactly', 'was', 'so', 'important', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'leave', 'there', 'were', 'also', 'great', 'number', 'characters', 'were', 'only', 'developed', 'half-way', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'particular', 'employee', 'corporation', 'built', 'time', 'machine', 'seemed', 'was', 'more', 'going', 'audience', 'were', 'filled', 'on.The', 'set', 'design', 'poor', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'better', 'when', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'film', 'looked', 'was', 'made', 'back-lot', 'Monty-Python', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Everything', 'just', 'looked', 'was', 'made', 'cardboard.Speaking', 'cardboard', 'acting', 'awful', 'be', 'new', 'whipping', 'boy', ""'ll"", 'say', 'again', 'PAUL', 'WALKER', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'ACT', 'be', 'worst', 'actor', 'modern', 'era', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'carry', 'headline', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'ability', 'Other', 'then', 'cast', 'list', 'was', 'pretty', 'well', 'loaded', 'talent', 'was', 'never', 'cultivated', 'properly.The', 'directing', 'was', 'lazy', ""'m"", 'normally', 'big', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'fan', 'have', 'only', 'been', 'handful', 'movies', 'done', 'really', 'think', 'were', 'stinkers', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'resume', 'too', 'loaded', 'great', 'films', 'think', 'was', 'anything', 'other', 'then', 'hiccup', ""'m"", 'not', 'letting', 'off', 'hook', 'had', 'TON', 'resources', 'disposal', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'ANY', 'together.The', 'time', 'money', 'were', 'pumped', 'Timeline', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'better', 'product', 'then', 'were', 'ultimately', 'going', 'get', ""'m"", 'instead', 'left', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'inclined', 'just', 'go', 'watch', 'Braveheart', 'again']",N/A

Therefore, I cannot comment on the quality and / or fidelity of the adaptation. The movie explores the same idea several others have applied in the past, time travel, but the setting is a period that is not the most usual. It seems that traveling to Arthurian settings is the most successful formula, but in this case the time leap is to the fourteen century in Castlegard, France. &quot;Timeline&quot; does not present a lot of new elements or a surprising plot, it is mainly a formulaic approach to a previously explored subject. The only contributions to this &quot;mini-genre&quot; are improved special effects and costume and set design.The movie starts when a man suddenly materializes in the middle of a deserted highway, dressed in medieval clothes and dying; his final word is &quot;Castlegard&quot;. A representative of an organization called International Technology Corporation (ITC), for which the dead man worked, immediately shows up at the hospital to claim the body and to try to hamper any further investigation. However, the doctors have enough time to find out that the blood vessels and organs in the deceased are misaligned and have no idea what the explanation may be.At the same time, a group of archeologists that are funded by ITC finds the six-hundred-year-old ruins of Castlegard. Chris, the son of the chief archeologist in the expedition, Professor Johnston, is not very interested in the ruins, but he wants to hang around because he is in-love with his father's assistant.When Chris's father leaves the site to go to the corporate offices of ITC to talk business, the team at the archeological site keeps on working and makes a stunning discovery. Among the ruins Chris and his beloved Kate, find a note from the professor asking for help and a broken glass that confirms the identity of the sender of the message. Trying to make sense of this Chris and Kate, along with four other friends, go to ITC looking for some answers. What they find is a time machine that was used by the professor to go back in time to Castlegard, France in 1357. Now they have to go back to the rescue and immerse themselves in a dangerous adventure.This is the type of movie that you should choose to watch being aware that there is nothing outstanding about it, not the acting, the plot or any other aspect. It may be though a good way to spend a couple of hours entertained, since you will not need to pay a lot of attention or follow the action very closely to perfectly understand what is going on.

806756,A3NM1MT3Q2FHXV,B0001I55NS,S.E. Poza,"[5, 5]","I wish I hadn't read Michael Crichton's Timeline novel so that I could simply say this is another bland action picture  in a period setting from unimaginative storytellers which neither offends nor thrills. Unfortunately, having read the book, I know better. There was a lot of squandered potential which makes this film willfully bland and disappointing rather than accidentally so.The basic story is about a group of archaeologists who travel back in time to the 1400's to rescue a fellow archaeologist who is stranded in time. That much of the story is the same as the novel. The problem is that the movie is poorly paced such that there is little drama and that the characters aren't sufficiently fleshed out to make you care if (or when) they die. The bulk of the story seems geared toward getting the heroes repeatedly captured and having them escape as well as to get to the battle scenes as quickly and as frequently as possible.I'm not one of those people who feel that a novel should be slavishly adhered to at a movie's expense. Books clearly needed to be adapted but they should always lose detail or have the story restructured to the benefit of a movie, not to its detriment as was the case here. For instance, the means by which the characters time travel is altered and greatly simplified compared to the book and that was a good idea.However, some of the best visual scenes in the book are simply not used in the movie for no reason that I can think of rather than being overly cheap. The opening scene is an excellent example. (Spoiler) When a person repeatedly travels in the story, there are alignment errors which creep into their reconstituted form. In the book, this is shown by a man whose face, body, and even clothing appear to be out of alignment. Instead of doing a little makeup and sewing to show this, a fellow is X-rayed and we're shown microscopic details of this misalignment. As an opening scene, the impact of a slightly and weirdly deformed man mysteriously showing up would have made for much better drama and suspense than the opening scene of the movie. (end spoiler)It's disappointing that such an interesting book was made into such a boring movie. I hope Michael Crichton sold as many books for this novel as he'd hoped to already because the fact that the movie is so weak is sure to turn people off to the book.",2,Such a wasted opportunity,1117843200,"06 4, 2005",2005,2356,"['wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'read', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'Timeline', 'novel', 'could', 'simply', 'say', 'bland', 'action', 'picture', 'period', 'setting', 'unimaginative', 'storytellers', 'offends', 'thrills', 'Unfortunately', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'better', 'was', 'lot', 'squandered', 'potential', 'film', 'willfully', 'bland', 'disappointing', 'rather', 'accidentally', 'so.The', 'basic', 'story', 'group', 'archaeologists', 'who', 'travel', 'back', 'time', '1400', 'rescue', 'fellow', 'archaeologist', 'who', 'stranded', 'time', 'much', 'story', 'same', 'novel', 'problem', 'movie', 'poorly', 'paced', 'such', 'little', 'drama', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'sufficiently', 'fleshed', 'out', 'make', 'care', 'when', 'die', 'bulk', 'story', 'geared', 'getting', 'heroes', 'repeatedly', 'captured', 'having', 'escape', 'as', 'well', 'get', 'battle', 'scenes', 'quickly', 'as', 'frequently', 'possible.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'novel', 'should', 'be', 'slavishly', 'adhered', 'movie', 'expense', 'Books', 'clearly', 'needed', 'be', 'adapted', 'should', 'always', 'lose', 'detail', 'have', 'story', 'restructured', 'benefit', 'movie', 'not', 'detriment', 'was', 'case', 'here', 'instance', 'means', 'characters', 'time', 'travel', 'altered', 'greatly', 'simplified', 'compared', 'book', 'was', 'good', 'idea.However', 'best', 'visual', 'scenes', 'book', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'used', 'movie', 'reason', 'can', 'think', 'rather', 'being', 'overly', 'cheap', 'opening', 'scene', 'excellent', 'example', 'Spoiler', 'When', 'person', 'repeatedly', 'story', 'are', 'alignment', 'errors', 'creep', 'reconstituted', 'form', 'book', 'shown', 'man', 'face', 'body', 'even', 'clothing', 'appear', 'be', 'alignment', 'Instead', 'doing', 'little', 'makeup', 'sewing', 'show', 'fellow', 'X-rayed', ""'re"", 'shown', 'microscopic', 'details', 'misalignment', 'opening', 'scene', 'impact', 'slightly', 'weirdly', 'deformed', 'man', 'mysteriously', 'showing', 'up', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'drama', 'suspense', 'opening', 'scene', 'movie', 'end', 'spoiler', 'disappointing', 'interesting', 'book', 'was', 'made', 'such', 'boring', 'movie', 'hope', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'sold', 'many', 'books', 'novel', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'already', 'fact', 'movie', 'so', 'weak', 'sure', 'turn', 'people', 'book']",N/A

Previously, I hesitated to get it because of all these critical reviews, but when the opportunity to rent it arose, my curiosity won out. To my surprise, it was not nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be. I've seen a lot of cheap, badly-scripted films before, and I wouldn't say this is one of them. I'm sure there are ways they could have done better - I mean, what movie wouldn't benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop the story further? - but considering what they had to work with, I think they did very well. Part of the attraction for me is seeing familiar faces, like Paul Walker, Billy Connolly, and David Thewlis, though he seems an odd choice to cast as the unscrupulous, foul-mouthed head of ITC. Chris (Paul Walker) is supposed to be the main character of the story, but in both the book and the movie it is Andre Marek that steals the scenes. Played by Gerard Butler, he is sure to charm viewers with his chivalric deeds and lilting Scottish accent.In the book, the only takeaway point seemed to be that times were violent, contrasting this with the romantic view we have of the medieval ages today. The movie skillfully balances both the romance and the fighting, taking time to note the characters' horror at having to kill people while also delicately develop the romance. I also liked that Chris, totally disinterested in history at the beginning, discovers how real and how pertinent it really is for all of us by the end of the movie.

806781,A1C80B497LCYKA,B0001I55NS,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[2, 4]","I was glad to see that most reviewers realized that director Richard Donner (16 Blocks, Lethal Weapon, Superman) was to blame for turning a perfectly good Michael Crichton story into an episode of Time Tunnel. I knew something was wrong when Gerard Butler (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie) - a talented actor - who plays archeologist Andre Marek, was reminding me of Mel Gibson from Lethal Weapon. Like so many actors before him, he was momentarily seduced by the Richard Donner ""let's forget the script and just ad lib"" school of acting. I think he finally does overcome the Donner side of the Force, and turns in a good performance in the second half of the film. But there's a lot the audience has to endure until we get to that point.Like 14th Century English soldiers being understood by 21st Century English-speaking scientists, and vice versa! That's seven centuries! (We can barely understand our own parents.) So the believability factor is quite low in this pseudo sci-fi thriller. It would have made much better sense to make this a fantasy film, left out all the fake scientific stuff, and gone straight to the battle and love story, which are the best parts anyway. That said, there are some problems with the historical side of the story as well. Even with all the extra features praising their own efforts at research and authenticity, I felt like I was watching a modern day Renaissance Festival, rather than real people living in a real era.But the battle at the end is exciting; and Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Me Without You) as Lady Claire and Gerard Butler as Marek do hold our attention as they woo each other, as does Paul Walker (The Fast And The Furious, 8 Below) as Chris Johnston, the son of the scientist they've all gone back in time to rescue. The rest of the cast is just okay. Even though Frances O'Connor has third billing, I found her to be too hysterical for a scientist. More Donner influence, I'm sure.If you have any interest in science, history or good filmmaking, you may want to avoid this one. But if you don't mind totally escapist fare, and like Gerard Butler, Anna Friel or Paul Walker, you may find it somewhat enjoyable. It has so much potential that it is a real shame Donner didn't take his job more seriously. So this is one that someday may make a good remake.Waitsel Smith",3,DECENT BATTLE SCENE AND ACTOR GERARD BUTLER MAKE THIS SCI-FI THRILLER WATCHABLE,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2335,"['was', 'glad', 'see', 'most', 'reviewers', 'realized', 'director', 'Richard', 'Donner', '16', 'Blocks', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'Superman', 'was', 'blame', 'turning', 'perfectly', 'good', 'Michael', 'Crichton', 'story', 'episode', 'Time', 'Tunnel', 'knew', 'something', 'was', 'wrong', 'when', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Dear', 'Frankie', 'talented', 'actor', 'who', 'archeologist', 'Andre', 'Marek', 'was', 'reminding', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'so', 'many', 'actors', 'was', 'momentarily', 'seduced', 'Richard', 'Donner', 'let', 'forget', 'script', 'just', 'ad', 'lib', 'school', 'acting', 'think', 'finally', 'overcome', 'Donner', 'side', 'Force', 'good', 'performance', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'lot', 'audience', 'endure', 'get', 'point.Like', '14th', 'Century', 'English', 'soldiers', 'being', 'understood', '21st', 'Century', 'English-speaking', 'scientists', 'vice', 'versa', 'seven', 'centuries', 'can', 'barely', 'understand', 'own', 'parents', 'believability', 'factor', 'quite', 'low', 'pseudo', 'sci-fi', 'thriller', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'much', 'better', 'sense', 'make', 'fantasy', 'film', 'left', 'out', 'fake', 'scientific', 'stuff', 'gone', 'straight', 'battle', 'love', 'story', 'are', 'best', 'parts', 'anyway', 'said', 'are', 'problems', 'historical', 'side', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'extra', 'features', 'praising', 'own', 'efforts', 'research', 'authenticity', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'modern', 'day', 'Renaissance', 'Festival', 'rather', 'real', 'people', 'living', 'real', 'era.But', 'battle', 'end', 'exciting', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Goal', 'Dream', 'Begins', 'Me', 'Lady', 'Claire', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Marek', 'do', 'hold', 'attention', 'woo', 'other', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Fast', 'Furious', '8', 'Below', 'Chris', 'Johnston', 'son', 'scientist', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'rescue', 'rest', 'cast', 'just', 'okay', 'Even', 'Frances', ""O'Connor"", 'third', 'billing', 'found', 'be', 'too', 'hysterical', 'scientist', 'More', 'Donner', 'influence', ""'m"", 'sure.If', 'have', 'interest', 'science', 'history', 'good', 'filmmaking', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'totally', 'escapist', 'fare', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'Anna', 'Friel', 'Paul', 'Walker', 'may', 'find', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'real', 'shame', 'Donner', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'job', 'more', 'seriously', 'one', 'someday', 'may', 'make', 'good', 'remake.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

History knows where it's going, and makes sure things turn out the way they did anyway. For movie purposes, the good guys (or most of them) win and the bad guy suffers the fate he had planned for them.The nominal story is that The Professor - Uncle Monty from Lemony Snicket - is an archaeologist, and has hooked up with The Corporation. The time travel thingy can only contact one place and time, oddly enough, the site of his research dig back when it was still current events. (Why is is that time machines can only go to interesting places?) The Prof gets stuck way back when, and The Corp convinces his students to go back after him. The Corp omits a few details, like people occasionally coming back in pieces, and sends them back to collect The Prof. That, of course, is where the fun starts.The rest of the movie is all running around in itchy clothes, trying to hide from both the English and the French as the coming battle looms, and seeing what their archaeological ruins looked like before they were ruined. A technical malfunction (a hand grenade in the time machine) gums things up a bit, but we needed some reason to prolong the voyage. The female characters are good, certainly not the ""save me"" sort. The male characters are somewhat standard, including a father and son reconciliation in the offing and a few auxiliaries with short life expectancies.

Thanks to their knowledge of history and the arts, Evelyn helps William Shakespeare finish writing Romeo and Juliet by feeding him his own dialogue, while Tommy gives Sir Walter Raleigh lessons in chivalry. TIME FLIES is a largely forgettable romp, but the point is that even this modest picture contains a couple of pretty clever ideas.Now, some 60 years and a few million dollars later, comes TIMELINE, a grating time travel tale filled with lots of CGI effects and nary one fresh idea. Although the main characters are whisked off to 14th-century, the filmmakers don't go back any further than BRAVEHEART and the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy as a source for their borrowed concepts, characters, and imagery. (It also steals from the 1960s TV series TIME TUNNEL.)The plot-or what passes for one-deals with the efforts of an archeologist's son (Paul Walker) to rescue his father (Billy Connolly), who's trapped in 14th-century France thanks to some sort of time travel snafu. Naturally, sonny boy and an intrepid gang of scientists teleport themselves back in time to snatch dear ol' dad from the jaws of certain death. (Though it's a little-known historical fact, 14th-century France was overrun with American actors sporting heavy makeup and phony accents.)This is one of those empty, slick-but-still-cheesy-looking adventures that should have skipped theatrical distribution and gone straight to UHF-television syndication instead; all that's missing are the Cellular One and KFC commercials.
