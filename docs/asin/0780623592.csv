The politians will do whatever they can to stay on top legal or illegal. Pacino  was excellent as he always is. Cusack was great as the deputy mayor who  uncovers the conspricy. The film shows how politians fall from grace so  easily.,4,American Politics,948412800,"01 21, 2000",2000,370,"['Good', 'film', 'how', 'once', 'idealilist', 'politian', 'engulfed', 'power', 'corrupt', 'Sad', 'true', 'american', 'politics', 'politians', 'will', 'do', 'can', 'stay', 'top', 'legal', 'illegal', 'Pacino', 'was', 'excellent', 'always', 'Cusack', 'was', 'great', 'deputy', 'mayor', 'who', 'conspricy', 'film', 'how', 'politians', 'fall', 'grace', 'so', 'easily']",N/A
32976,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0780623592,Austin Somlo,"[1, 1]","Viewed: 6/04, 5/05Rate: 65/05: City Hall is an elaborately made picture that seems to be fogged up by the complicated story yet with a strong sense of being a political thriller. The cast, besides Al Pacino, does well but is occasionally dead. When Al Pacino is not seen, the story of the film seems to move well, slowly getting to the point. The moment Al Pacino appears, there is a rousing of energy that sends City Hall on a faster pace. When he disappears, City Hall almost becomes stagnant but moving slowly. John Cusack is very interesting here as the Deputy Mayor, outlining his job, but his acting isn't consistent throughout the film. Danny Aiello does well enough to give his weight. Bridget Fonda's role is a puzzling one. Although her character is intriguing, she doesn't do much to add another dimension of City Hall, and it seems to me that she couldn't live up to the demands of the film. For the story, it feels, to me, too vague but with some clear messages. Harold Becker's direction is well done and needs to be strengthened a bit more for the sake of clarity in the story. Back to Al Pacino, this is very fine acting, being able to create energy like that and to make waves out of nothing. He almost brings Michael Corleone back, but Al Pacino takes a different direction in the characterization of John Pappas, the not-so-apparent-corrupt mayor of New York. The eulogy speech remains the best scene of City Hall. Then, the stretch to the finishing line with John Cusack, Al Pacino carefully and skillfully orchestrates his acceptance to bottom out, and he does this so marvelously well. At best, Al Pacino is absolutely riveting in City Hall. Like Glengarry Glen Ross, City Hall features another memorable, can't-miss Al Pacino performance. All in all, City Hall comes off as a weak picture due to poorly developed lines and a shoddy story, but Al Pacino makes it extremely watchable, and the film had the potential to play out as a great political game.",3,Al Pacino Is At His Thrilling Best!,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,1975,"['Viewed', '6/04', '5/05Rate', '65/05', 'City', 'Hall', 'elaborately', 'made', 'picture', 'be', 'fogged', 'up', 'complicated', 'story', 'yet', 'strong', 'sense', 'being', 'political', 'thriller', 'cast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'well', 'occasionally', 'dead', 'When', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'not', 'seen', 'story', 'film', 'move', 'well', 'slowly', 'getting', 'point', 'moment', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'rousing', 'energy', 'City', 'Hall', 'faster', 'pace', 'When', 'City', 'Hall', 'almost', 'stagnant', 'moving', 'slowly', 'John', 'Cusack', 'very', 'interesting', 'here', 'Deputy', 'Mayor', 'outlining', 'job', 'acting', ""n't"", 'consistent', 'film', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'well', 'enough', 'give', 'weight', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'role', 'puzzling', 'one', 'character', 'intriguing', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'add', 'dimension', 'City', 'Hall', 'could', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'demands', 'film', 'story', 'too', 'vague', 'clear', 'messages', 'Harold', 'Becker', 'direction', 'well', 'done', 'be', 'strengthened', 'bit', 'more', 'sake', 'clarity', 'story', 'Back', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'very', 'fine', 'acting', 'being', 'able', 'create', 'energy', 'make', 'waves', 'nothing', 'almost', 'Michael', 'Corleone', 'back', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'different', 'direction', 'characterization', 'John', 'Pappas', 'not-so-apparent-corrupt', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'eulogy', 'speech', 'best', 'scene', 'City', 'Hall', 'Then', 'stretch', 'finishing', 'line', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'carefully', 'skillfully', 'acceptance', 'bottom', 'out', 'so', 'marvelously', 'well', 'best', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'City', 'Hall', 'Glengarry', 'Glen', 'Ross', 'City', 'Hall', 'memorable', ""can't-miss"", 'Al', 'Pacino', 'performance', 'City', 'Hall', 'off', 'weak', 'picture', 'due', 'poorly', 'developed', 'lines', 'shoddy', 'story', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'extremely', 'watchable', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'play', 'out', 'great', 'political', 'game']",N/A

If you're just some stiff with $8.00 for a movie ticket, then `let the buyer beware' should be your credo.I am not a big Pacino fan, feeling he  only plays one character well, and that one I'm way past tired. John  Cusack, on the other hand, is a different story. Next to him Pacino has a  good chance of looking good here, and he does.What Bridget Fonda or her  character is doing, I have no idea. The role she plays here is so  meaningless you have to wonder if she put some money in the picture  herself. In the fast moving world of Hollywood's careers, one rarely  recovers from this Waterworld sized mistake. She gets her mortgage paid,  I'm sure, but we get absolutely nothing in return.

It had a great cast and crew of which I have seen excellent films from.  But all I got in the end was a lukewarm film.  The premise is great.  Political corruption always makes for an interesting movie and it  certainly is interesting.  Sadly it suffers from its own plot. So much time  is spent trying to uncover this scandal that occurs in this film that there  is no time to get to know any of the characters.  Al Pacino plays the mayor  of New York and while he handles the role passionately the script does not  allow  his character anytime to develop as with Cusak, Fonda, Aiello.  The  cast is supurb.  In fact I do not believe I have seen better from John  Cusak who rarely gets a stab at complex films such as this and Bridget  Fonda and Danny Aiello both give excellent supporting performances.  The  intereaction between Cusak and Fonda also seemed really fake as well not by  the actors fault but the screenwriters.  There is no chemestry where one  would expect.  It isn't all that bad of a film.  Fans of the actors should  definately rent it especially for a really good Pacino monologue (they had  to throw that in somewhere).

32982,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0780623592,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","The film concerns a classic theme. In fact it concerns the theme exploited by Batman, from beginning to end, but in real data and details. The mayor of New York, appreciated and very diligent and dynamic, in order to get some project through slightly faster than normal, yields to some pressure from some private business contractors about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent and kept in prison and he pressurizes the judge in his turn to set him free on probation in spite of a negative probation report that disappears but is not destroyed, be it only because of the political value it represents. And what was to happen happens and a few people, including a black schoolboy is killed in a shoot out between a police detective and that  criminal. The city may explode because of it: racial tension because of the black school boy and social tension because of the insecurity such criminals free to roam around and go on with their criminal activities represent to the public. Unluckily the film does not show that tension very well and follows the investigation  of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and does find it out. But along the way a few witnesses are killed, and those who had played some role in the whole business are forced to retire (the judge), to end their career and life (the contractor or the contractor's go between), a public officer who was ready to deliver the disappeared probation report, and some shady character after he provides some crucial information. The mayor himself retires and takes a long vacation; But the main interest of the film is in the exploration of the contortions the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the contortions he remembers having done in the past that led to the mistake about this probation case. The political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is grey which is never comfortable to decision makers is invoked as an excuse for wrong but profitable decisions. We are not speaking of necessary compromises to get to some consensus in some domains that are crucial to public interest. We are speaking of considering as less important to take a bad decision  about some petty or supposedly petty criminal than some infrastructure or economic project in the city. That is not typical of New York. That is true in any mayoral office. It is just more significant in quantity and in quality in a big metropolitan area like New York and of course in a city or country where police departments are municipal and are controlled by political imperatives. The young deputy mayor is thus pushing the old mayor out of the way, and he derails his ambition to be the governor of New York in order to become the president of the US. The mayor is perfect due to the embodiment Al Pacino offers us since he is able to express ten minutes of dialogue with one facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless. I find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor campaigning in his own name. That seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor out  of his own way. Hence he is not better than all the others, just still too young in his ambition.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",4,A good subject but the rhythm of a TV film,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,3354,"['film', 'classic', 'theme', 'fact', 'theme', 'exploited', 'Batman', 'beginning', 'end', 'real', 'data', 'details', 'mayor', 'New', 'York', 'appreciated', 'very', 'diligent', 'dynamic', 'order', 'get', 'project', 'slightly', 'faster', 'normal', 'yields', 'pressure', 'private', 'business', 'contractors', 'criminal', 'drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'kept', 'prison', 'judge', 'turn', 'set', 'free', 'probation', 'spite', 'negative', 'probation', 'report', 'disappears', 'not', 'destroyed', 'be', 'only', 'political', 'value', 'what', 'was', 'happen', 'happens', 'few', 'people', 'including', 'black', 'schoolboy', 'killed', 'shoot', 'out', 'police', 'detective', 'criminal', 'city', 'may', 'explode', 'racial', 'tension', 'black', 'school', 'boy', 'social', 'tension', 'insecurity', 'such', 'criminals', 'free', 'roam', 'around', 'go', 'criminal', 'activities', 'represent', 'public', 'film', 'not', 'show', 'tension', 'very', 'well', 'investigation', 'first', 'deputy', 'mayor', 'who', 'find', 'out', 'truth', 'find', 'out', 'way', 'few', 'witnesses', 'are', 'killed', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'role', 'whole', 'business', 'are', 'forced', 'retire', 'judge', 'end', 'career', 'life', 'contractor', 'contractor', 'go', 'public', 'officer', 'who', 'was', 'ready', 'deliver', 'disappeared', 'probation', 'report', 'shady', 'character', 'crucial', 'information', 'mayor', 'long', 'vacation', 'main', 'interest', 'film', 'exploration', 'contortions', 'mayor', 'doing', 'cover', 'up', 'problem', 'contortions', 'having', 'done', 'past', 'led', 'mistake', 'probation', 'case', 'political', 'philosophy', 'nothing', 'pure', 'white', 'pure', 'black', 'everything', 'grey', 'never', 'comfortable', 'decision', 'makers', 'invoked', 'excuse', 'wrong', 'profitable', 'decisions', 'are', 'not', 'speaking', 'necessary', 'compromises', 'get', 'consensus', 'domains', 'are', 'crucial', 'public', 'interest', 'are', 'speaking', 'considering', 'less', 'important', 'take', 'bad', 'decision', 'petty', 'supposedly', 'petty', 'criminal', 'infrastructure', 'economic', 'project', 'city', 'not', 'typical', 'New', 'York', 'true', 'mayoral', 'office', 'just', 'more', 'significant', 'quantity', 'quality', 'big', 'metropolitan', 'area', 'New', 'York', 'course', 'city', 'country', 'where', 'police', 'departments', 'are', 'municipal', 'are', 'controlled', 'political', 'imperatives', 'young', 'deputy', 'mayor', 'thus', 'pushing', 'old', 'mayor', 'way', 'ambition', 'be', 'governor', 'New', 'York', 'order', 'become', 'president', 'US', 'mayor', 'perfect', 'due', 'embodiment', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'able', 'express', 'ten', 'minutes', 'dialogue', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'whole', 'dialogue', 'useless', 'find', 'end', 'slightly', 'ex-deputy', 'mayor', 'campaigning', 'own', 'name', 'mean', 'was', 'so', 'attached', 'justice', 'saw', 'chance', 'push', 'mayor', 'own', 'way', 'Hence', 'not', 'better', 'others', 'just', 'still', 'too', 'young', 'ambition.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",N/A

David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable.There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many.  It may take a second viewing to remember, ""which Zapatti was which?""  After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap.The ending didn't have a lot of sting.

In CITY HALL, he suffers from the curse of too many writers spoiling the broth.  The script is disjointed, at times contradictory, and the ending is a letdown in the lack of its intensity.  Pacino is matched by a fine young actor, John Cusack, who plays the gungho idol worshipping deputy mayor.  Bridget Fonda is lovely to look at, but her role is so underdeveloped, she could have been a male character and we wouldn't have noticed the difference.  Danny Aiello is brilliant in his usual ""mafia"" role, but his talent enables him to instill a small sense of humaneness in his doomed role.  Notice the great opera singer Roberta Peters in the small role of his wife.  Anthony Franciosa, rarely seen in movies these days, plays the crime boss with a reserved intensity that makes him even more vitriolic.  David Paymer is good, but his role isn't fleshed out enough to know his character.  Martin Landau's judge is also almost a cameo, but Landau delivers.  Much mention is made of the late great Jerry Goldsmith's score, which is so eclectic, it doesn't have much impact.  The music at the end credits almost sounds like a western or war movie accompaniment.CITY HALL is interesting, but ultimately its tale of political corruption is so derivative and predictable, it doesn't elevate the movie to the potential greatness it could have achieved.",3,THE OLD GRAY MAYOR,1107907200,"02 9, 2005",2005,1467,"['One', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'electrifying', 'actor', 'can', 'make', 'almost', 'movie', 'better', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'CITY', 'HALL', 'curse', 'too', 'many', 'writers', 'spoiling', 'broth', 'script', 'disjointed', 'times', 'contradictory', 'ending', 'letdown', 'lack', 'intensity', 'Pacino', 'matched', 'fine', 'young', 'actor', 'John', 'Cusack', 'who', 'gungho', 'idol', 'worshipping', 'deputy', 'mayor', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'lovely', 'look', 'role', 'so', 'underdeveloped', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'male', 'character', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'noticed', 'difference', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'brilliant', 'usual', 'mafia', 'role', 'talent', 'instill', 'small', 'sense', 'humaneness', 'doomed', 'role', 'Notice', 'great', 'opera', 'singer', 'Roberta', 'Peters', 'small', 'role', 'wife', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'rarely', 'seen', 'movies', 'days', 'crime', 'boss', 'reserved', 'intensity', 'even', 'more', 'vitriolic', 'David', 'Paymer', 'good', 'role', ""n't"", 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'know', 'character', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'judge', 'also', 'almost', 'cameo', 'Landau', 'delivers', 'Much', 'mention', 'made', 'late', 'great', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'score', 'so', 'eclectic', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'impact', 'music', 'end', 'almost', 'sounds', 'western', 'war', 'movie', 'HALL', 'interesting', 'ultimately', 'tale', 'political', 'corruption', 'so', 'derivative', 'predictable', ""n't"", 'elevate', 'movie', 'potential', 'greatness', 'could', 'have', 'achieved']",N/A

It has good pacing, clarity and moving speeches.  It examines the possibility that the deal making necessary for political effectiveness is also the root of corruption.  Still, it's nothing to go out of your way to see.First, it's predictable. You know whose clay feet the trail of corruption must lead to.  One minor character mentions that he's six months from retirement. You know he'll never collect the pension.Also, the film had four writers and seems haunted by distracting fragments from abandoned drafts as if someone wrote things that others took in different directions.  Shifting character focus between drafts would explain why important characters often receive perfunctory development while others seem overwritten.  The film lacks a center because Mayor Papas (Pacino) is simply a charismatic icon- important only for what he represents to others. Brigit Fonda plays an attractive do-gooder who challenges the hero (John Cusack) to be true to his ideals. There's little chemistry because her character lacks development and their relationship is a formulaic flirtation.  By contrast, Danny Aiello's character, an Italian politician, defies stereotype because he loves musical theater rather than opera. However, since the character is otherwise predictably stereotypical, the attention given his musical tastes (including a strange duet with a waiter) seems pointless.Indeed, ethnic and regional origins often substitute for character development here.  The hero's Louisiana hometown is mentioned twice, establishing him as an idealistic but wily outsider. Yet, curiously, the mayor is a Greek who spouts yiddishisms.  That and other scattered references made me wonder if he wasn't Jewish in earlier drafts and a more developed character.

The admiration that the young man has for the older one and his ultimate disillusionment is a good story.  Unfortunately there are too many characters doing too many undercover things and I lost track which diminished my interest in the film. They should have provided a roster of characters.Bridget Fonda appears briefly as another idealistic young person and for a while there seems to be a possibility of something more than camaraderie between her and the Cusak character, but that story line was sort of dropped until the rather silly ending.Overall the acting was first rate.  Pacino was magnificent.  Others have called his Harlem ""sermon"" over-the-top but I thought it was the best thing in the film.  (reminded me of Bill Clinton)Cusak is quite good too, but when he's on the screen with Pacino, all eyes are with the old guy; he is amazingly entertaining.All of the supporting characters are well played with the possible exception of Fonda whose presence was lack-luster.If I could, I've give the film three and a half stars.

32995,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,0780623592,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","Pacino has been my favorite actor ever since his amazing performance in Heat. It has always bothered me when people cut him down saying that he doesn't give a serious performance but  that he relies on overacting and shouting. After watching this film though I must agree. He gives an excellent performance that is very touching and subtle but  is ruined by a scene in the middle of the film where he resorts to shouting and overacting. Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver), Nicholas Pileggi (Goodfellas), and two other writers contributed to the script which focuses on government corruption in the Big Apple. John Pappas (Pacino) is the well liked mayor and Kevin (John Cusack) is his loyal assistant. Frank Anselmo (Danny Aiello) is a union boss who promotes himself as a friend of the people but is being told what to do by a powerful mobster. Bridget Fonda plays a tireless investigative reporter who knows that none of these men are what they seem and is determined to tell the citizens the truth. A rogue cop has a meeting with a drug dealer one rainy morning. He isn't wearing a vest and he doesn't have any backup to assist him should things go wrong. He has gotten a tip from the dealer's cousin as to where he can find his man and when all three of them come face to face they surprise each other and guns are drawn. In the chaotic shootout the cop and the dealer get shot as well as a six year old boy who was being walked to school by his grandfather. All three die. The story quickly breaks all over the news and the mayor has to address this tragedy. He makes a hastily assembled speech without knowing all the particulars and he assigns Kevin the task of finding out what really happened. This sends Kevin on a search for answers in which he finds out more than he ever wanted to  about Pappas. The mystery deepens when Kevin tries to figure out whose bullet struck the kid. Was it the cop's or the dealer's? The legal system is indicted as well since the dealer should have been in jail but a judge let him walk. Martin Landau plays the conflicted judge and proves that nearly all the government officials in this film are corrupt. The scene that nearly spoils Pacino's overall performance is when he delivers the eulogy at the  boy's funeral. His advisers have all warned him that appearing at the funeral is not a wise move but he insists that he must be there to inspire hope and unity. The speech starts off sincere and builds from there. Soon Al is shouting and his eyes are going wild and he's slamming the pulpit with both fists. He works the mostly black congregation into a frenzy. We've seen this before and for the first time I realize that there is a time and a place in a Pacino film for this kind of outburst and at this particular moment  it doesn't feel right. Al does this better than anybody and even though it's entertaining to watch it comes at a price. Pacino is back to serious acting in the film's final scenes. By this time  Kevin  knows the truth and confronts Pappas  at his mansion before he is to speak at another memorial. Kevin is devastated that his mentor has been lying to him and Pacino plays the scene as if he were Kevin's father and Kevin is his grown son who no longer needs hims. The film has a lot of talented people involved and even though the story isn't that shocking and is confusing at times City Hall is a decent enough movie.",3,Al Pacino overacts?!,1209340800,"04 28, 2008",2008,3381,"['Pacino', 'been', 'favorite', 'actor', 'ever', 'amazing', 'performance', 'Heat', 'always', 'bothered', 'when', 'people', 'cut', 'down', 'saying', ""n't"", 'give', 'serious', 'performance', 'overacting', 'shouting', 'watching', 'film', 'must', 'agree', 'excellent', 'performance', 'very', 'touching', 'subtle', 'ruined', 'scene', 'middle', 'film', 'where', 'shouting', 'overacting', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'Nicholas', 'Pileggi', 'Goodfellas', 'two', 'other', 'writers', 'contributed', 'script', 'government', 'corruption', 'Big', 'Apple', 'John', 'Pappas', 'Pacino', 'well', 'liked', 'mayor', 'Kevin', 'John', 'Cusack', 'loyal', 'assistant', 'Frank', 'Anselmo', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'union', 'boss', 'who', 'friend', 'people', 'being', 'told', 'what', 'do', 'powerful', 'mobster', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'tireless', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'who', 'none', 'men', 'are', 'what', 'seem', 'determined', 'tell', 'citizens', 'truth', 'rogue', 'cop', 'meeting', 'drug', 'dealer', 'one', 'rainy', 'morning', ""n't"", 'wearing', 'vest', ""n't"", 'have', 'backup', 'assist', 'should', 'things', 'go', 'wrong', 'gotten', 'tip', 'dealer', 'cousin', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'man', 'when', 'three', 'come', 'face', 'face', 'surprise', 'other', 'guns', 'are', 'drawn', 'chaotic', 'shootout', 'cop', 'dealer', 'get', 'shot', 'as', 'well', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'being', 'walked', 'school', 'grandfather', 'three', 'die', 'story', 'quickly', 'news', 'mayor', 'address', 'tragedy', 'hastily', 'assembled', 'speech', 'knowing', 'particulars', 'Kevin', 'task', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Kevin', 'search', 'answers', 'out', 'more', 'ever', 'wanted', 'Pappas', 'mystery', 'when', 'Kevin', 'figure', 'out', 'bullet', 'struck', 'kid', 'Was', 'cop', 'dealer', 'legal', 'system', 'indicted', 'as', 'well', 'dealer', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'jail', 'judge', 'let', 'walk', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'conflicted', 'judge', 'nearly', 'government', 'officials', 'film', 'are', 'corrupt', 'scene', 'nearly', 'Pacino', 'overall', 'performance', 'when', 'eulogy', 'boy', 'funeral', 'advisers', 'have', 'warned', 'appearing', 'funeral', 'not', 'wise', 'move', 'must', 'be', 'there', 'inspire', 'hope', 'unity', 'speech', 'sincere', 'builds', 'there', 'Soon', 'Al', 'shouting', 'eyes', 'are', 'going', 'wild', 'slamming', 'pulpit', 'fists', 'mostly', 'black', 'congregation', 'frenzy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'before', 'first', 'time', 'realize', 'time', 'place', 'Pacino', 'film', 'kind', 'outburst', 'particular', 'moment', ""n't"", 'feel', 'right', 'Al', 'better', 'anybody', 'even', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'price', 'Pacino', 'back', 'serious', 'acting', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'time', 'Kevin', 'truth', 'confronts', 'Pappas', 'mansion', 'speak', 'memorial', 'Kevin', 'devastated', 'mentor', 'been', 'lying', 'Pacino', 'scene', 'were', 'Kevin', 'father', 'Kevin', 'grown', 'son', 'who', 'no', 'longer', 'hims', 'film', 'lot', 'talented', 'people', 'involved', 'even', 'story', ""n't"", 'shocking', 'confusing', 'times', 'City', 'Hall', 'decent', 'enough', 'movie']",N/A
32996,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0780623592,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[3, 3]","Al Pacino is Pappas, the first great Greek mayor of New York City in this overly complex ploitical thriller hinting at the rot underlying big-city politics.  Though the advertising and packaging of the movie focus on Pacino, the real hero is John Cusack as Kevin Calhoun, a Louisiana transplant who lives to be Mayor's eyes and ears.  Calhoun's Louisiana background hints at Huey-Long style politics and a massively powerful and successful political future of his own, but for the moment, he's jumping for bullets aimed at the Mayor.  We're supposed to see the city as Calhoun's biggest test - he's savy enough about politics, but New Yorkers with their Yiddishisms just baffle him.Unfortunately, the city plainly baffles the people who made this movie.  The story begins with a street shootout on a rainy day involving a recently released con.  The sentencing judge, the PO and the city's political bosses discover their own dirty acts as Cuisack follows the trail.  People die mysteriously and the hints of organized crime remain fairly visible.  But there's no story, only a bunch of scenes (not enough containing Pacino) hinting at the political rot, but no connetcing plot.  By the time credits roll, you're not sure what you've seen or who should take the consequences.  The flick boasts some top-flight talent (Cusack and Pacino, Martin Landau as the embattled judge, but also Danny Aiello as the political boss, the underrated David Paymer and Bridget Fonda), but they do nothing more than float through the movie.  It's not clear if Fonda is supposed to be Cusack's foil, love interest or the charachter that gets Cusack to step out of others' shadows and become the leader he knows he can be.

It's as if the characters, the plot, and the pacing of the film were kept apart throughout filming, and then only introduced in the editing room.  The film begins with a lackluster conflict, the accidental shooting of a child by a drug dealer with relatives in the NY mob families who looks as if he came directly from Central Casting, and acts just as stiff. Before we even know anything about this character, he's confronted by a possibly corrupt cop ( the entire background motivation and confusion regarding the cop's rational for meeting with the drug dealer alone, without backup and without reporting in first is left completely unresolved), gunfire is exchanged, and everyone is dead, including the innocent child, who is clearly injected into this formula for nothing more than aesthetic/emotional purposes, and is treated like ""cinema-chum"", shot dead for instant sympathy by the audience, only to draw in the bigger fish in the water, the primary characters.On the heels of the shooting, we are introduced to our principles, Al Pacino as the mayor, John Cusack as the deputy mayor, single-handedly managing the entirety of New York. The completely contrived setup of the administration of a city the size of New York being managed, at least from all appearances we are given on screen, by these two characters is beyond laughable, but  insipid.  The central plot of the movie springs from the reaction by City Hall to this one shooting incident, as the world is (we suppose) put on temporary pause for days afterward in New York by this event. Cusack abandons his supposed position with City Hall and becomes a knee-jerk Mickey Spilane, trodding beside Bridget Fonda on some half-ass investigation of the politics surrounding the now dead cop, suspected of corruption, and the question of why the drug dealer was ever on the streets in the first place, having been questionably released on parole years before. Everyone phones in their performances, which appears as if everyone approached the movie with high hopes, then got distracted by something better to do, (possibly calling their agents for better scripts once this movie started filming) and just showed up to through with the dialogue.  Numerous gaffs, faux pauxs regarding life in New York, cornball accents by Cusack, Fonda's character operating with the depth of a spring puddle, vanilla backgrounds, boring dialogue (save Al Pacino's impassioned, yet ultimately weak tirades toward the shooting of James Bone and his personal conversations with Pappas) make for a really unsatisfying films; ""City Hall"" just can't deliver and feels like a TV movie of the week.",2,City Hall  (1996),1135987200,"12 31, 2005",2005,2979,"['Cast', 'Harold', 'BeckerCast', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'John', 'Cusack', 'Bridgett', 'Fonda', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'David', 'Paymer', 'Anthony', 'Franciosa', 'Richard', 'Schliff', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan.Running', 'Time', '111', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'language', 'violence', 'City', 'Hall', 'one', 'hopeful', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'films', 'never', 'really', 'potential', 'characters', 'plot', 'pacing', 'film', 'were', 'kept', 'apart', 'filming', 'then', 'only', 'introduced', 'editing', 'room', 'film', 'lackluster', 'conflict', 'accidental', 'shooting', 'child', 'drug', 'dealer', 'relatives', 'NY', 'mob', 'families', 'who', 'came', 'directly', 'Central', 'Casting', 'just', 'stiff', 'even', 'know', 'anything', 'character', 'confronted', 'possibly', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'entire', 'background', 'motivation', 'confusion', 'regarding', 'cop', 'rational', 'meeting', 'drug', 'dealer', 'alone', 'backup', 'reporting', 'first', 'left', 'completely', 'unresolved', 'gunfire', 'exchanged', 'everyone', 'dead', 'including', 'innocent', 'child', 'who', 'clearly', 'injected', 'formula', 'nothing', 'more', 'aesthetic/emotional', 'purposes', 'treated', 'cinema-chum', 'shot', 'dead', 'instant', 'sympathy', 'audience', 'only', 'draw', 'bigger', 'fish', 'water', 'primary', 'characters.On', 'heels', 'shooting', 'are', 'introduced', 'principles', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'mayor', 'John', 'Cusack', 'deputy', 'mayor', 'single-handedly', 'managing', 'entirety', 'New', 'York', 'completely', 'contrived', 'setup', 'administration', 'city', 'size', 'New', 'York', 'being', 'managed', 'least', 'appearances', 'are', 'given', 'screen', 'two', 'characters', 'laughable', 'insipid', 'central', 'plot', 'movie', 'springs', 'reaction', 'City', 'Hall', 'one', 'shooting', 'incident', 'world', 'suppose', 'put', 'temporary', 'pause', 'days', 'afterward', 'New', 'York', 'event', 'Cusack', 'supposed', 'position', 'City', 'Hall', 'knee-jerk', 'Mickey', 'Spilane', 'trodding', 'beside', 'Bridget', 'Fonda', 'half-ass', 'investigation', 'politics', 'surrounding', 'now', 'dead', 'cop', 'suspected', 'corruption', 'question', 'why', 'drug', 'dealer', 'was', 'ever', 'streets', 'first', 'place', 'having', 'been', 'questionably', 'released', 'parole', 'years', 'Everyone', 'phones', 'performances', 'everyone', 'approached', 'movie', 'high', 'hopes', 'then', 'got', 'distracted', 'something', 'better', 'do', 'possibly', 'calling', 'agents', 'better', 'scripts', 'once', 'movie', 'started', 'filming', 'just', 'showed', 'up', 'dialogue', 'Numerous', 'gaffs', 'faux', 'pauxs', 'regarding', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'cornball', 'accents', 'Cusack', 'Fonda', 'character', 'operating', 'depth', 'spring', 'puddle', 'vanilla', 'backgrounds', 'boring', 'dialogue', 'save', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'impassioned', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'weak', 'tirades', 'shooting', 'James', 'Bone', 'personal', 'conversations', 'Pappas', 'make', 'really', 'unsatisfying', 'films', 'City', 'Hall', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'feels', 'TV', 'movie', 'week']",N/A
