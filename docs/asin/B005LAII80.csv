It turns out this is one of those films you can watch more than once and keep picking up more interesting aspects.Overall the film has a troubling story, but the comic book fans are giving great reviews.  The quality of the photography is the best part, in my opinion.  As far as a story, this does have plot parallels with The Raid Redemption.  Wonder if the comic inspired that movie too....Definitely worth buying, but is extremely violent, graphically so.  Only thing missing is the smell of all that blood (if you ever worked in an ER trauma center, you know what I mean.)Now that I have seen the 3D version, I have to give it 5 stars.  A visually impressive piece of cinema, well worth owning, as long as you are not letting little kids see all the violence in it.

1483184,A3JXPMX8E59PL1,B005LAII80,Adam B. Krenn,"[0, 0]","Okay, I get why so many give this five stars and I did very much enjoy this film, but...The best Judge Dredd film is still Robo-cop. Hear me out.Judge Dredd the Stallone craptacular had some very fine Judge Dredd qualities about it even if it failed on some important notes. Mainly, the decision to turn Dredd into a heroic character. My understanding (and much to Stallone's credit) is that Stallone fought to keep many elements in tact from the comic but simply lost too many behind the scene battles. Ultimately though, Rob Schneider as Walter the Wobot and other elements made this film just too off base from the source material.This film Dredd, gave us an incredibly gritty take on Judge Dredd. Far more grittiness than even the comic book had. It was as if the pendulum swung too far the other direction. This Mega-City One was a bland and brutal place, devoid of craziness and relying on the 90's version of the stereotypical thug for the vast majority of its baddies. Despite some of its perfunctory elements, the whole film worked and it was nice to see a more visceral take on the action. Karl Urban was fantastic as Judge Dredd, even sounding eerily like Clint Eastwood in several scenes (which is acceptable as Dirty Harry was the template for Judge Dredd). Olivia Thirlby was also great as a young Judge Anderson, giving us a much more human side of the Judges, even if she was well on her way to becoming nearly as hard as Dredd by the end. My only complaint (albeit a small one in the overall context of the film) was a small scene in the finale in which Dredd chose an action that could make him out to be sadistic. Dredd was never a sadist. Overall though, just not a particularly good Judge Dredd story yet a good film and decent introduction to that universe. I know that may seem confusing but I stand by it. Karl Urban = Great as Dredd. Film = Great entertainment. A Dredd Story = A decent introduction if not the best example of a Dredd story. The important part is that the producers got the important elements of Judge Dredd, mostly right.A quick note on Robo-Cop. So many elements in that film were spot on from the old 2000 A.D.s with both the gritty and nasty city and all of its twisted humor and irony in tact (Something sorely missing from Dredd (film) and the strong fascist cop protagonist (if too sympathetic in relation to Dredd). Even Robo-Cop's famous line is right out of one of Judge Dredd's earliest comics, ""Come quietly or there will be trouble."" Anyway, still the best overall Judge Dredd adaptation.So for Dredd, despite its flop in theaters, it has been doing amazingly well on both rental and purchase for home video and I know I would love to see more of Karl Urban as Dredd. Fingers crossed.",4,Great but still not the best Dredd,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,2739,"['Okay', 'get', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'did', 'very', 'much', 'enjoy', 'film', 'best', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'film', 'still', 'Robo-cop', 'Hear', 'Dredd', 'Stallone', 'craptacular', 'had', 'very', 'fine', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'even', 'failed', 'important', 'notes', 'Mainly', 'decision', 'turn', 'Dredd', 'heroic', 'character', 'understanding', 'much', 'Stallone', 'credit', 'Stallone', 'fought', 'keep', 'many', 'elements', 'tact', 'comic', 'simply', 'lost', 'too', 'many', 'scene', 'battles', 'Ultimately', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Walter', 'Wobot', 'other', 'elements', 'made', 'film', 'just', 'too', 'off', 'base', 'source', 'material.This', 'film', 'Dredd', 'gave', 'incredibly', 'gritty', 'take', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Far', 'more', 'grittiness', 'even', 'comic', 'book', 'had', 'was', 'pendulum', 'swung', 'too', 'far', 'other', 'direction', 'Mega-City', 'One', 'was', 'bland', 'brutal', 'place', 'devoid', 'craziness', 'relying', '90', 'version', 'stereotypical', 'thug', 'vast', 'majority', 'baddies', 'perfunctory', 'elements', 'whole', 'film', 'worked', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'more', 'visceral', 'take', 'action', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'even', 'sounding', 'eerily', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'several', 'scenes', 'acceptable', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'was', 'template', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'young', 'Judge', 'Anderson', 'giving', 'much', 'more', 'human', 'side', 'Judges', 'even', 'was', 'well', 'way', 'becoming', 'nearly', 'as', 'hard', 'Dredd', 'end', 'only', 'complaint', 'small', 'one', 'overall', 'context', 'film', 'was', 'small', 'scene', 'finale', 'Dredd', 'chose', 'action', 'could', 'make', 'out', 'be', 'sadistic', 'Dredd', 'was', 'never', 'sadist', 'Overall', 'just', 'not', 'particularly', 'good', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'story', 'yet', 'good', 'film', 'decent', 'introduction', 'universe', 'know', 'may', 'seem', 'confusing', 'stand', 'Karl', 'Urban', '=', 'Great', 'Dredd', 'Film', '=', 'Great', 'entertainment', 'Dredd', 'Story', 'decent', 'introduction', 'not', 'best', 'example', 'Dredd', 'story', 'important', 'part', 'producers', 'got', 'important', 'elements', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'mostly', 'right.A', 'quick', 'note', 'Robo-Cop', 'So', 'many', 'elements', 'film', 'were', 'spot', 'old', '2000', 'A.D.s', 'gritty', 'nasty', 'city', 'twisted', 'humor', 'irony', 'tact', 'Something', 'sorely', 'missing', 'Dredd', 'film', 'strong', 'fascist', 'cop', 'protagonist', 'too', 'sympathetic', 'relation', 'Dredd', 'Even', 'Robo-Cop', 'famous', 'line', 'right', 'one', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'earliest', 'comics', 'Come', 'quietly', 'will', 'be', 'trouble', 'Anyway', 'still', 'best', 'overall', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'adaptation.So', 'Dredd', 'flop', 'theaters', 'been', 'doing', 'amazingly', 'well', 'rental', 'purchase', 'home', 'video', 'know', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Dredd', 'Fingers', 'crossed']",N/A

In fact, many of the brightest names in American comics started writing in other countries, especially Britain, which has a distinct comic book industry that in many ways takes more chances than Marvel, DC, Image, or Dark Horse. Take '2000 AD' as an example. This sci-fi anthology magazine debuted in the mid-70's, and in the second issue it featured a strip called 'Judge Dredd'. The title character of the strip was a stern, no-nonsense cop living in an absolute police state. The property proved so popular that the strip has run non-stop in every issue of '2000 AD' ever since. Even more surprising, the comic takes place in real time, meaning that one year of our lives is one year in the world of 'Judge Dredd'. The comic is incredibly ambitious, with many storylines taking place over the course of six months or more.Judge Dredd is so popular in his native Britain that his name is used as a byword for the threat of a police state. Sadly, in America, most people's only exposure to the character is the 1995 Sylvester Stallone vehicle. While that movie has some fun elements, it did a terrible job of translating the comic to the screen. It's also tainted the franchise in American eyes so thoroughly that the character is considered something of a joke by anyone who hasn't read the brilliant comic books. As a result, another attempt at adapting the property to film hasn't happened for almost twenty years. But finally Alex Garland, author of 'The Beach' and screenwriter of '28 Days Later', 'Sunshine', and 'Never Let Me Go', managed to get the funds together to make a low budget film, this one titled simply 'Dredd'.'Dredd' stars Karl Urban in the title role. The film follows a day in the life of a Judge of Mega-City One, as Dredd assesses the telepathic Judge candidate Anderson [Olivia Thirlby]. They investigate a trio of homicides in the Peach Trees mega block (a city contained within a massive skyscraper that dwarfs the Empire State Building). In doing so, they get on the wrong side of Ma-Ma [Lena Headey], a drug lord determined to maintain her empire at any cost. Locking down the mega block, Dredd and Anderson have nowhere to go but up to find Ma-Ma in the penthouse&#8230;and judge her.'Dredd' develops a strong visual style, immediately distancing itself from the Stallone version. 'Dredd' is dirty, grimy, and feels incredibly real. The film was shot in South Africa, with Cape Town and Johannesburg standing in for the east coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic Mega-City. I was very impressed with the production design of 'Dredd'. It feels like a place that could exist under the right circumstances, instead of the 'Blade Runner' gone mad look that defined the 1995 film. Even more arresting are the &#34;Slo-Mo&#34; sequences. Slo-Mo is a drug that slows down time for the person high on it, and the filmmakers take great care to show these trips, turning gunfights into slow motion ballets of death. 'Dredd' takes this even further than films, using newly developed cameras that shoot at 3,000 frames per second, for an unparalleled sense of slow motion. The results are absolutely awesome and stunning.Karl Urban, perhaps the most underrated genre actor working today (having appeared in 'The Lord of the Rings', 'Star Trek', 'The Chronicles of Riddick', 'Priest', and many others) anchors the movie as the titular Judge Dredd, and he knocks it out of the park. Perpetually wearing Dredd's trademark scowl on his face, Urban plays Dredd as the no-nonsense Judge that he is. He doesn't get happy or even particularly mad. He just enforces the law the best way he knows how: Through the barrel of a gun. Urban spares us the melodrama that Stallone stuck us with, and the result is a wholly accurate portrayal of an iconic character.Blu-ray Video Quality - In 3D, 'Dredd' looks absolutely stunning. The sense of depth is apparent from the very first frames, as we see Mega-City One in the distance, with the Cursed Earth in the foreground. You really get a sense of space and distance, and director Pete Travis skilfully retains this sense throughout the film. Once we get into Peach Trees, the framing frequently makes use of the confined areas, showing us the characters through grates or fences, barred windows and other perspectives that not only enhance the 3D, but also makes us feel as if the building itself were spying on Dredd and Anderson. Clarity is also astonishing. The close-up shots of the techie's electronically enhanced eyes are some of the most striking shots I've ever seen on a Blu-ray disc. Small details like the stains on Ma-Ma's teeth, the pits of her scars, or the graffiti scrawled on walls are all easy to spot and isolate. The layers of the 3D environment are all immaculately rendered, without making any individual element feel like a cardboard cut-out. Again, the framing is clearly meant for 3D, placing characters against backdrops so they stand out. Foreground and background separation is wide, and the picture often feels like you're looking into a real 3D space. Shots bearing down on characters from above highlight their isolation within the frame, which the 3D heightens. In both the 3D and 2D transfers, colors look very good. 'Dredd' uses a drab colour scheme, creating a world that looks like it's falling apart at the seams. Sickly greens, browns, and oranges dominate. Red is ruddy, so when the blood starts flying, it's not a bright crimson but more of a darker hue. Flesh tones are accurate. Contrast looks pushed, but this was intentional on the part of the filmmakers. This affects whites the most, as they sometimes veer very close to blooming. Blacks are more solid.Blu-ray Audio Quality - This mix is incredibly aggressive. The movie may be low budget, but the sound is big enough for a movie with a three hundred million dollar bankroll. Directionality is spectacular, with bullets bouncing from left to right and front to back. The imaging is seamless and very organic. The sound field is almost always active with sonic detail. A great example is again when Dredd steps off his bike after flipping the van full of drug crazes criminals. His foot lands with an immense thump thanks to the thunderous effects. As he approaches the van, you hear the crinkle of his leather armour, the tinkling of broken glass falling from the van, and his hand tightening on the grip of his Lawmaker. Even the quiet moments are alive with vividly realised sound.The coldly electronic score, vaguely reminiscent of another great urban sci-fi actioner, 'Escape From New York', keeps up through most of the film, yet never overtakes the dialogue or the effects. Balancing in general isn't a problem. You can hear Urban's satisfying growl, Ma-Ma's lazy drawl, and Anderson's small worried voice without any problems. And again, when you get into the Slo-Mo sequences, even the sound changes, becoming airy and ethereal, keeping with the theme of time slowing down.Blu-ray Supplements and Extras:Both the 2D and 3D versions are found on this disc which is great but sadly, most of the extras felt like they were going to be great but ended up being far too short.Dredd 2000AD The Original [HD 03:28] is a short featurette covering the history of Judge Dredd.Slo-mo [HD 02:12] shows the ideas behind the drug induced visuals and the super slo-mo effect generated in the film.Welcome to Peachtrees [HD 02:34] is a look at Mega City One's Megablocks.The 3rd Dimension [HD 02:00] 'Dredd' was shot in 3D, and this featurette talks about that process. We also get a look at the slow-motion cameras used for the Slo-Mo sequences and get to see a lot of the camera tests they ran to get the blood to look the way they wanted.Dredd's Gear [HD 02:32] A very quick glance at the design of Dredd's costume, the Lawmaker, and his motorcycle. I really would have liked to see more of this, especially as it looks like they managed to make the Lawgiver a working gun.Dredd [HD 01:52] an EPK style overview of the film. As you can probably tell from the generic title and short runtime, this is total studio promotional fluff, with more footage from the movie than anything else.The biggest chunk on the extras are the &#8216;Interviews&#8217; [HD 26:35], which are with all involved in the project. It&#8217;s a shame they are cobbled together with static question cards and bland talking head answers.There&#8217;s also a selection of other trailers in the &#8216;Previews&#8217; section.Finally, 'Dredd' is the best action film when it was released in 2012, as well as one of the most faithful comic book adaptations of all time. Karl Urban becomes Dredd, and Lena Headey is downright despicable as the notorious Ma-Ma. The movie is relentless and driving, nothing but pure action from start to finish. The 3D transfer on this Blu-ray disc is absolutely stunning, with incredible clarity and immense depth with almost no ghosting. The 2D transfer isn't quite as immaculate, with unfortunate digital noise in many of the darker shots. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix is bold and aggressive, one of the best I've heard all year.If you didn't see this movie, and judging by worldwide box office receipts most people didn't, please heed all the good reviews and buy this Blu-ray. There are literally hundreds of stories that can be culled from the 'Judge Dredd' universe, and according to writer/producer Alex Garland, he had some big plans for future instalments. If enough people buy this Blu-ray and show the studio that there's an audience for more 'Dredd' material that might be enough to get someone to green light a sequel. Dredd is one of the best &#8220;hidden gems&#8221; in comic book movie history, satisfying on a huge variety of levels. Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey are all in top-form alongside a wonderful, but small, supporting cast. Dredd is definitely destined to become a cult classic.As a comic book fan, and an action movie fan, I urge every one of you who reads this to go out and buy a copy. If you don't comply...you will be judged. Highly Reccomended! One thing extra I want to mention is that I originally had the Region A/1 version and there was a real horrendous problem with the 3D and I had to send it back and I feel my 3D Blu-ray has far superior extras, but sadly there is one extra that is missing from the Region B/2, which is 'Dredd Motion Comic Prequel' which gives you a backstory on supervillain Madeline and the slo-mo drug and This essentially sets up Ma-Ma and explains how slow-mo came to be and it is narrated mainly by Urban, and we can definitely see the similarity in the art style of the amazing comic '2000 AD'.Andrew C.

1483235,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B005LAII80,Brian Driver,"[2, 3]","NOTE: THIS CONTAINS NO SPOILERS!When Hollywood makes a movie based upon a work of another medium--in this case a noted British graphic novel series that began in the 1970s--it has a certain responsibility do more than just adhere to the original in some manner. Some think it's sufficient to simply let the name speak for itself, and feel if they throw a certain amount of money at the project-even if it's just to purchase a celebrity to play the lead and throw in a heaping amount of special effects--then they've done enough.But as we've all seen, that kind of attitude can come near to killing a possible franchise. I citeGreen Lantern,Daredevil, the Joel Schumacher'sBatman & Robin, and almost anySupermanmovie after the first. And, in this case...The godawful 1995Judge Dredd, starring Sly Stallone, in which the lawman came off like a claymation dullard. To be fair, it's a tough role for any actor: the central character's helmet covers everything but his chin and his scowl. But even with those limitations, Karl Urban's characterization is still leagues ahead of Stallone's.It's a comparison that has done nothing but harm, in fact: it's believed that this movie's lack of audience and financial earning can be linked directly to the bad taste the Stallone film left in the fan base's collective mouth. It's reported that DREDD, which cost an estimated $50 million, has not yet broken even--and that's killing any chance for a sequel. Many have drawn a more ""friendly"" comparison, however, to theRobocopfranchise, yet that current franchise has stalled, too.I think this current movie has a closer modern counterpart, and that'sThe Raid: Redemption. Granted, that film is a martial arts movie, whereas this is guns, guns, guns, but the movie's theme--a slum apartment complex serves as a mob's fortress--couldn't be closer to the this movie's plot AND, most notably, the fact that, somehow, the film crew just gets it RIGHT.Like THE RAID: REDEMPTION, DREDD is a well-made movie that sets about a goal and delivers on it with great style and action. Both are willing to minimize setting in order to ""enclose"" itself both physically and thematically--allowing a tighter focus on its key elements.While the story began with a motorcycle chase, pretty much all of the rest of the film takes place within a into 200-story mega-ghetto called the Peach Tree, which is ruled by an iron-fisted psychopath named, ironically, Mama (Lena Headey). When Mama learns that one of her own men has been captured--one who has enough damaging information on her to cripple her lucrative drug trade--she literally shuts the doors to the complex, trapping the Judge and a trainee within, and uses the building's public address system to promise a sizable bounty to anyone who executes them. When you consider The Peach Tree has a population in the hundreds of thousands, it's pretty much a death sentence. It's a great movie tactic, too, as the Judge is stripped of his usual advantages and must rely on wits as much as weaponry.What really stands out about this movie, however, is the director/screenwriter's decision to make the film's violence reflective of the drug Mama is pushing: the brand new psychedelic drug called Slo-Mo...so named because it slows down the taker's perceptions so that his sense of the ""present"" is occurring at about 1/100th the speed we typically perceive things. That means the scenes of drug use are not just violent--they are as kinetically vivid as anything I've ever seen. The bullet enters the skin and there is time before it exits: skin ripples, blood explodes, waves of pressure cause visible interior damage. Yes, director Pete Travis indulges violence, but it is thematically appropriate, and to those who find this a horrifically indulgent kind of violence I can only thank the heavens for the director's RESTRAINT: imagine how horrible it would have been had he decided to depict the skinning of three drug competitors at the start of the film. They had been forced to take the drug just before they were skinned alive and thrown from the top of the open central atrium into the lobby 200 floors below. To imagine what they went through would be appalling.In fact, there is even personal growth (gasp!) on the part of Judge Dredd in this film. I felt for the man, and I felt for Anderson, his trainee (Olivia Thirlby). Don't get me wrong: this is an action movie, plain and simple, but Director Travis understands that the movie is at its best stride when we see Dredd as a man who is both NEARLY invulnerable. Perfection would be machine-like, and I found it interesting that there is really not much in the way of futuristic innovation in this dystopia (the film is set in 2074): a quick look at automobiles in the early car chase scene yielded little more than what's out there now. The same went for any ""creature comforts"" in the apartments in the Peach Tree--granted, it is a ghetto; but the movie seems to be saying that the only real innovations that make it into our near future six decades on comes in the form of the surveillance capabilities available to those who can manipulate them.Not that THAT could happen, right?",4,"Don't ""Judge"" This Film by Its

High octane from the just east of the word go, this film attempts to take the comic out of the original comic and instead focus on tactical appearances, a few socially critical absurdities, and guns.  Lots of guns.Karl Urban (Red, Chronicles or Riddick, Riddick, Star Trek) doesn't quite give the Dredd of the comic book; adapting into a cold, robot like bad ass super cop: part Robocop, part Christian Bale Batman, part Stallone Dredd with some added nuisances.  The performance does stand on its own at times, all though Dredd is less the focus of the movie and more the main protagonist.Unlike many big budget action films, the performances are better than average; from top to bottom, the cast is an excellent mix of notable actors (such as Wood Harris, Remember the Titans and The Wire, and Lena Headey, 300) who provide stellar performances and well thought out characters creates stories and story lines that can't help but draw attention.  However, being a bit too wrapped up in the genere, the film focuses more on their actions than exploring their depth.The visual effects add to small glitches in costuming.  The penultimate effects in the film, however, fall a bit flat, as they are played with through the film but, like the characters, not entirely explored.  The lack of experimentation with the actual camera in filming also detracts a bit, not pushing the viewer far enough out their comfort zone to really enchant them with the effects.  The scenery and lighting attempt to coincide with the modern-noir take of high contrast color schemes, however they lack a certain pop.A true fan of Stallone's Dredd will be let down by this film.  It is by no means a sequel, nor does it attempt to explore Dredd's origin as done in the nineties.  A bit closer to the comics, the film lacks the grandeur placed in mega city one in Stallone (cheesy at may be).  Dredd, reimagined, lacks the booming voice of authority, but does still way lay the scum of the city in mere moments.  No flying bikes, no interjections of other 2000 AD comics, no Rob Schnider.  The quirks are replaced in an attempt to be serious.Not something most people will add to their collection, but worth a rent if a fan of the genre and (to some extent) the comic.

If you want a good futuristic action flick, this is it.What I really enjoyed about this movie was the filming technique, music, and multiple homages to Blade Runner.Visually, the movie is kind of a cross between RoboCop/District 9/ and 300.  there are some scenes where the CGI is overdone to the point where it no longer looks like a movie...or animation from the 1980s...however, these are usually drug-induced &#34;dream-like&#34; sequences, so maybe this was the intent.Substantively, there is not much to this film.  The movie presents a &#34;day in the life of&#34; a &#34;Judge&#34; in megacity one, and a rookie he is tasked with evaluating.  The world depicted is dark, gritty, uncaring, corrupt, and beyond saving.  The Judges try and maintain order, although without any notions of due process.  The accused are adjudged and sentenced on site, and the Judges carry out the punishments---usually death.  Dredd and his rookie get trapped in a mega high rise apartment complex--a &#34;city within a city&#34;--where they do battle with an ex-hooker ganster/drug dealer who has taken over the building and wants the Judges' heads on a platter.  Dredd is a no-emotions, cool operator, who dispenses life sentences based on bad acts with no regard for the mental state or motivation of the guilty.  His sidekick is a telepath, and provides a empathetic &#34;foil&#34; to Dredd's cold nature.The filming does a nice job of presenting a sense of claustrophobia and &#34;no way out&#34;--although you never really fear that the judges will not come out on top.Most of the movie is a standard shoot-em-up, as the Judges first try and escape the building, and then decide to go after the baddie.  There is a small plot twist; but most of the movie is predictable.  What is nice is that the movie avoids most of the usual hollywood cliches of hero saving the planet, getting the girl, etc.  Dredd gets out alive and presumably suits up the next day and does the same thing.So why am I giving it 4 starts?  Visually, the movie is pretty stunning and really &#34;brings&#34; you into the world.  The special effects are pretty good and the Judges have some cool tech they bring along.  The DTS sound is great.  This is not an oscar-type movie....Rather, it is a good  Saturday afternoon popcorn.beer flick.  I was entertained, and will probably watch it again.  They don't make many of these types of movies anymore, and it is a shame because Dredd is just good escapist fun and doesn't pretend to be anything more.",4,BladeRunner Meets Robocop,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2585,"['was', 'not', 'expecting', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'want', 'good', 'futuristic', 'action', 'flick', 'it.What', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'filming', 'technique', 'music', 'multiple', 'homages', 'Blade', 'Runner.Visually', 'movie', 'kind', 'cross', 'RoboCop/District', '9/', '300.', 'are', 'scenes', 'where', 'CGI', 'overdone', 'point', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'movie', 'animation', '1980s', 'however', 'are', 'usually', 'drug-induced', '34', 'dream-like', '34', 'sequences', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'intent.Substantively', 'not', 'much', 'film', 'movie', '34', 'day', 'life', '34', '34', 'Judge', '34', 'megacity', 'one', 'rookie', 'tasked', 'evaluating', 'world', 'depicted', 'dark', 'gritty', 'uncaring', 'corrupt', 'saving', 'Judges', 'try', 'maintain', 'order', 'notions', 'due', 'process', 'accused', 'are', 'adjudged', 'sentenced', 'site', 'Judges', 'carry', 'out', 'punishments', '-usually', 'death', 'Dredd', 'rookie', 'get', 'trapped', 'mega', 'high', 'rise', 'apartment', 'complex', '34', 'city', 'city', '34', 'where', 'do', 'battle', 'ex-hooker', 'ganster/drug', 'dealer', 'who', 'taken', 'over', 'building', 'Judges', 'heads', 'platter', 'Dredd', 'no-emotions', 'cool', 'operator', 'who', 'life', 'sentences', 'based', 'bad', 'acts', 'regard', 'mental', 'state', 'motivation', 'guilty', 'sidekick', 'telepath', 'empathetic', '34', 'foil', '34', 'Dredd', 'cold', 'nature.The', 'filming', 'nice', 'job', 'presenting', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', '34', 'way', '34', 'never', 'really', 'fear', 'judges', 'will', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'top.Most', 'movie', 'standard', 'shoot-em-up', 'Judges', 'first', 'try', 'escape', 'building', 'then', 'decide', 'go', 'baddie', 'small', 'plot', 'twist', 'most', 'movie', 'predictable', 'What', 'nice', 'movie', 'most', 'usual', 'hollywood', 'cliches', 'hero', 'saving', 'planet', 'getting', 'girl', 'etc', 'Dredd', 'out', 'alive', 'presumably', 'suits', 'next', 'day', 'same', 'thing.So', 'why', 'am', 'giving', '4', 'starts', 'Visually', 'movie', 'pretty', 'stunning', 'really', '34', 'brings', '34', 'world', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Judges', 'have', 'cool', 'bring', 'along', 'DTS', 'sound', 'great', 'not', 'oscar-type', 'movie', '.Rather', 'good', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'popcorn.beer', 'flick', 'was', 'entertained', 'will', 'probably', 'watch', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'types', 'movies', 'anymore', 'shame', 'Dredd', 'just', 'good', 'escapist', 'fun', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'anything', 'more']",N/A

JUDGE DREDD is one of those films that's just so awful, you can't help but watch it.  DREDD is not that kind of film.  Not to say it's a great piece of cinema; it isn't, far from it.  But as an action film that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's definitely a welcome adaptation.The plot is simple: the titular judge of few words and a psychic rookie along for the ride check out a triple homicide in a 200-story skyscraper kingdom ruled with an iron fist by drug lord Ma-Ma.  When the judges take one of Ma-Ma's men prisoner, she overreacts and shuts the building down.  The judges now have to shoot their way out.  You know what happens next.Karl Urban brings some excellent screen presence to the role of Dredd; his face mostly covered (yes, comic fans, the entire movie!), he speaks in a harsh drawl that conveys an excellent mix of menace and humor.  Olivia Thirlby, as the rookie Anderson, is a welcome surprise, especially when her character is given permission to get down and dirty and kick some bad guy butt.  As Ma-Ma, Lena Headey is a menacing delight; it's a shame that her character isn't given more to do, and that the ultimate showdown is so sudden and disappointing.  If anything, that is perhaps DREDD's biggest weakness: with such a small premiss (characters stuck inside a skyscraper, no way to go but up and out), the film needs to drown in tension.  It doesn't.  There are no real stakes; we know Dredd will get out alive, and we know the bad guy (or girl) will be punished.  DREDD offers some good imagery, some great action sequences, and a nice lead turn from Urban; but it lacks anything surprising or original.  Still, for someone wanting a more faithful adaptation, something darker and more action-driven, then this is a good enough film.

Its a drug bust film where Dredd attempts to stop the MaMa gang( or whatever they are called) from spreading this reality altering drugs.

1483321,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B005LAII80,E. David Swan,"[0, 5]","I came into this film from the perspective of a long time Judge Dredd fan dating back to 1983 with his run in Eagle comics.. When I saw the 1995 film I didn't walk out of it hating it but I saw huge room for improvement. In particular I was disturbed by the removal of his helmet and the addition of his wacky sidekick played by Rob Schneider. Dredd 3D corrects a lot of the problems of the previous film but then introduces all new ones.My concern started with the opening pan shot of Mega City One. This was not Mega City. Mega City is a massive densely populated supercity that spans the entire east coast with enormous mile high buildings. What I saw here was a rather ordinary looking city with the occasional CGI superskyscraper doting the landscape. Dredd 3D had a modest $45 million budget, half the cost of the 1995 film, but $45 million isn't chump change. The action scene that starts the film is small and forgettable and banks on the vicious way that Dredd kills the criminal to sell itself.If I were to describe the Judge Dredd comic in just one word it would be satirical. If I were to describe Dredd 3D in just one word it would be gritty. My second choice would be violent. Despite its many flaws the 1995 film was correct to never take itself too serious. Judge Dredd is big, bold and over the top. Dredd 3D feels small and grim. There is a fan made video on YouTube called Judge Minty that actually does a better job of recreating Judge Dredd on what I assume is a miniscule budget. That is not to say Judge Minty is better. It suffers from the same problem as most fan made movies which is a forgettable plot and amateurish acting but the uniforms and Dredd's Lawmaster look much better.The producers of Dredd 3D made the correct albeit obvious decision to keep his helmet on the whole movie but then ended up radically changing the rest of the uniform. It's hugely toned down to give it a more realistic look but again I think the producers miss the point of Judge Dredd. The comic book costume is ridiculous but that was the intent. The oversized shoulder pads, knee pads and elbow pads are a reflection of the over the top nature of the comics. The point of the comic wasn't to make Judge Dredd the world's biggest bad ass. It's about social commentary and irony. There is the irony of this machine like judge dressed in an incredibly outlandish, non utilitarian uniform. Dredd 3D nails the look of the helmet but besides that the 1995 film does a much better job. Well, except for the bizarre metal codpiece.Judge Dredd holds an 18% on Rottentomatoes while Dredd 3D has an enviable 78%. I would put both the films closer to the midway point between the two. If you want a relatively fun, violent action film with a character whose name happens to be the same as a comic character you can certainly do worse than Dredd 3D but if you want the comic Judge Dredd and his world brought to life you'll have to keep waiting. If this were a very good film but not a great interpretation of Judge Dredd I could appreciate it for what it is but there is just so little for me to latch on to. The music is unremarkable and dated. The sets feel like they're from a movie with an even smaller budget than this one and besides a few interesting moments the film just didn't make a lasting impression on me. I did appreciate the casting of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby who were both excellent. The one weak cast member was Wood Harris whose acting resembled his name.I have to wonder if the very generous reviews are a reaction to the fact that this movie is so aggressively not Judge Dredd 1995. However to me it feels like they threw the baby out with the bathwater. Honestly, the 1995 film did not get everything wrong. A film that's much closer to Judge Dredd in tone would be the original Robocop would featured tons of social commentary and kept a balance between the violence and levity. Despite the favorable reviews Dredd 3D was a fairly sizable bomb at the box office and I noticed that user audience reactions were slightly lower than professional reviews which is rare for an action adventures movie. If you love the film, that's cool. Support it, buy the blu-ray and if enough are bought maybe a sequel will actually be made but if you're not a reader of the comic know that this isn't just a slight alteration of the source material. Dredd 3D is a complete departure in terms of tone and unlike a character like Batman there haven't been tons of tonal shifts in Dredd throughout the years so as far as I know this is a unique interpretation and in my opinion not an improvement.",3,Did Not Live Up to the Reviews,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",2013,4602,"['came', 'film', 'perspective', 'long', 'time', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'fan',

1483325,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B005LAII80,Einsatz,"[0, 1]","Well...............it is action packed.  There's tons of violence/carnage.  The `Slo-Mo' drug effect was dazzling to behold.  The overall look of the film was dark, grimy, and oddly beautiful.  The story was basic to say the least, and it said the least: Dredd and his psychic sidekick are trapped in a building and must fight off scores of Ma-Ma's henchmen.  It's obvious they want sequels and they will probably churn them out.  I, however, won't be wasting my money or time watching them.I admit, I don't know a thing about the British comic book this movie was based on (apparently, its 35 years of satire aimed squarely at America.  None of it is meant to be flattering.)  So, I had to judge this movie purely on what it delivered, which was a mindless set of incredible action sequences.  Unfortunately, action in and of itself is not particularly interesting unless it's attached to something or someone we can care about.  Dredd is a robotic guy in a uniform that doesn't exude any personality whatsoever.  At one point in this movie, he's fighting 3 fellow judges dressed exactly as he is.  I couldn't tell them apart.  It didn't make any difference, proving that anyone wearing the suitable outfit could play this character.  An automaton persona was all that was required to play any of the characters in this movie, no one stood out.  The star of this movie was obviously meant to be the action sequences.  Making this a fabulous looking offering not unlike Iron Pyrite (pretty, but useless).For me, DREDD lacked the basic elements that I look for which guarantees multiple viewing pleasure.  The missing ingredient here is the human factor.  Dreed was this drab and dreary guy who could just as easily have been a CGI creation.  In fact, they really didn't need any characters at all, just gunfire, explosions, and all that lovely Slo-Mo.Didn't mind watching it once, won't be watching it again.",3,"""There are no sides.

The rest is a gore fest of unrelenting carnage. For people who don't understand the source material, I can assure you that this movie stays close to it. Judge Dredd would rather die before he takes off his helmet, and his helmet is never removed the entire movie. Most big name actors would never do this (Stallone), But Karl Urban insisted it be this way. His gun is pretty amazing, which you have to see to understand. Without ruining any of the plot, this movie isn't intended to be an end of the world scenario as most action movies usually are. This is a normal day in the life of Judge Dredd, which is akin to the original Die Hard movie, if every single day was like the Nakatomi plaza incident for John McClane.

1483328,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B005LAII80,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[9, 14]","The issue with Hollywood in the past few years is studios' fascination with rebooting anything and everything. That obsession has given us some excellent features, such as Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, ""The Three Stooges"", and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". However, most of what we get is middling, such as the misguided ""The Amazing Spider-man"", to unnecessary, such as this year's ""Total Recall"", to outright crap, like... well, like the rest of them. So I was a bit gun shy when I saw that Lionsgate was issuing a remake of the abhorrent Sylvester Stallone vehicle ""Judge Dredd."" After some positive reviews came out, I decided to give it a shot. Thanks to that decision, I have a new film that is has been firmly added to my favorite sci-fi features of all time.In the future, the world is a desert wasteland, and the only life is housed in a giant city spanning multiple U.S. states, appropriately called Mega-City. Crime is out of control in Mega-City, and the only line of defense against them is the Hall of Justice. Working for the Hall are armored super-cops called Judges, who possess sweet motorcycles, tight leather chaps, and pistols that are capable of firing explosives, taser rounds, and splitter shots, to name a few. The best of these Judges is Dredd (Karl Urban), a seemingly emotionless man whose only goal in life is to deliver fair, by-the-books justice. But when he is tasked with training the unstable, psychic rookie Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), his morals are put to the test. The two find themselves locked in a 200-story apartment complex, and pitted against an army of goons amped up on a dangerous drug called ""Slo-Mo"", all controlled by the ruthless gang boss affectionately called ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headey.) Throughout the course of one night, they must survive both their assailants and each other.""Dredd"", in the face of so many detractors (myself included), is a triumph in both action and science fiction cinema. Its gunfights are more tense than any scene in ""The Expendables 2"", and the near-future setting is far more enthralling than anything we saw in ""Prometheus."" The dialogue is very minimalist, and fits the overall tone of the film quite well. Dredd's one-liners never feel hammy and are always natural, thanks to Urban's surprising performance. Thirlby conveys her character's pathos and apprehension beautifully, to the point of her almost stealing the show from everybody else in the movie. Rivaling her is Headey, who is deliciously evil and obviously having a great time playing somebody with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This is a movie that one could watch and enjoy for the acting alone.Action buffs have nothing to worry about, either. The shootouts are exciting and packed with some of the most visceral gore this side of a slasher flick, yet never cross into exploitation territory. More tension is packed onto these scenes due to the fact that ammo conservation and utilization of stealth are very real issues, giving more realism to the situation. The two Judges never feel superhuman, and are just as vulnerable as the droves of criminals that they pump full of lead. Special props should also be given to the slow motion effects, which are some of the best I've seen since ""300"", and in my opinion, raise a new standard from what we should expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. This film has less than a quarter of ""Avatar""'s budget, yet its effects are far more convincing, and I daresay better, than James Cameron's $300 Million+ ego trip. Studios need to take note that it's not the size of the budget that matters, it's all in how you use it.Every element of this film holds up to critical scrutiny, from the acting to the dialogue to the action sequences. Even Paul Leonard-Morgan's score is enthralling. A sci-fi/action movie hasn't captured me this much since ""The Matrix"", or even ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", two films which I feel are on this one's level. This is one example of a reboot that went beautifully right, and a definite must-see for moviegoers. ""Dredd"" is a triumph in action cinema, in sci-fi cinema, and in film in general. One of this year's best movies, one of the best action films of the past decade, and arguably the best reboot since ""Batman Begins.""Grade: A-",5,"Nothing To ""Dredd"" About This Phenomenal Reboot",1348963200,"09 30, 2012",2012,4263,"['issue', 'Hollywood', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'studios', 'fascination', 'rebooting', 'anything', 'everything', 'obsession', 'given', 'excellent', 'features', 'such', 'Nolan', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'trilogy', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'However', 'most', 'what', 'get', 'middling', 'such', 'misguided', 'Amazing', 'Spider-man', 'unnecessary', 'such', 'year', 'Total', 'Recall', 'outright', 'crap', 'well', 'rest', 'was', 'bit', 'gun', 'shy', 'when', 'saw', 'Lionsgate', 'was', 'issuing', 'remake', 'abhorrent', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'vehicle', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'positive', 'reviews', 'came', 'out', 'decided', 'give', 'shot', 'Thanks', 'decision', 'have', 'new', 'film', 'been', 'firmly', 'added', 'favorite', 'sci-fi', 'features', 'time.In', 'future', 'world', 'desert', 'wasteland', 'only', 'life', 'housed', 'giant', 'city', 'spanning', 'multiple', 'U.S.', 'states', 'appropriately', 'called', 'Mega-City', 'Crime', 'control', 'Mega-City', 'only', 'line', 'defense', 'Hall', 'Justice', 'Working', 'Hall', 'are', 'armored', 'super-cops', 'called', 'Judges', 'who', 'possess', 'sweet', 'motorcycles', 'tight', 'leather', 'chaps', 'pistols', 'are', 'capable', 'firing', 'explosives', 'taser', 'rounds', 'splitter', 'shots', 'name', 'few', 'best', 'Judges', 'Dredd', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'seemingly', 'emotionless', 'man', 'only', 'goal', 'life', 'deliver', 'fair', 'by-the-books', 'justice', 'when', 'tasked', 'training', 'unstable', 'psychic', 'rookie', 'Judge', 'Anderson', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'morals', 'are', 'put', 'test', 'two', 'find', 'locked', '200-story', 'apartment', 'complex', 'pitted', 'army', 'goons', 'amped', 'up', 'dangerous', 'drug', 'called', 'Slo-Mo', 'controlled', 'ruthless', 'gang', 'boss', 'affectionately', 'called', 'Ma-Ma', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'course', 'one', 'night', 'must', 'survive', 'assailants', 'other', 'Dredd', 'face', 'so', 'many', 'detractors', 'included', 'triumph', 'action', 'science', 'fiction', 'cinema', 'gunfights', 'are', 'more', 'tense', 'scene', 'Expendables', '2', 'near-future', 'setting', 'far', 'more', 'enthralling', 'anything', 'saw', 'Prometheus', 'dialogue', 'very', 'minimalist', 'overall', 'tone', 'film', 'quite', 'well', 'Dredd', 'one-liners', 'never', 'feel', 'hammy', 'are', 'always', 'natural', 'thanks', 'Urban', 'surprising', 'performance', 'Thirlby', 'conveys', 'character', 'pathos', 'apprehension', 'beautifully', 'point', 'almost', 'stealing', 'show', 'everybody', 'else', 'movie', 'Rivaling', 'Headey', 'who', 'deliciously', 'evil', 'obviously', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'playing', 'somebody', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'whatsoever', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'acting', 'alone.Action', 'buffs', 'have', 'nothing', 'worry', 'either', 'shootouts', 'are', 'exciting', 'packed', 'most', 'visceral', 'gore', 'side', 'slasher', 'flick', 'yet', 'never', 'cross', 'exploitation', 'territory', 'More', 'tension', 'packed', 'scenes', 'due', 'fact', 'ammo', 'conservation', 'utilization', 'stealth', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'issues', 'giving', 'more', 'realism', 'situation', 'two', 'Judges', 'never', 'feel', 'superhuman', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'vulnerable', 'droves', 'criminals', 'pump', 'full', 'lead', 'Special', 'props', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'slow', 'motion', 'effects', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', '300', 'opinion', 'raise', 'new', 'standard', 'what', 'should', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'less', 'quarter', 'Avatar', 'budget', 'effects', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'convincing', 'daresay', 'better', 'James', 'Cameron', '300', 'Million+', 'ego', 'trip', 'Studios', 'need', 'take', 'note', 'not', 'size', 'budget', 'matters', 'how', 'use', 'it.Every', 'element', 'film', 'critical', 'scrutiny', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'action', 'sequences', 'Even', 'Paul', 'Leonard-Morgan', 'score', 'enthralling', 'sci-fi/action', 'movie', ""n't"", 'captured', 'much', 'Matrix', 'even', 'Terminator', '2', 'Judgement', 'Day', 'two', 'films', 'feel', 'are', 'one', 'level', 'one', 'example', 'reboot', 'went', 'beautifully', 'right', 'definite', 'must-see', 'moviegoers', 'Dredd', 'triumph', 'action', 'cinema', 'sci-fi', 'cinema', 'film', 'general', 'One', 'year', 'best', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'action', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'arguably', 'best', 'reboot', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'Grade', 'A-']",N/A

1483334,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B005LAII80,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[1, 2]","Let's get one thing out of the way up front. The only thing 2012's ""Dredd"" and 1995's ""Judge Dredd"" have in common is a name. For those who have somehow escaped seeing a trailer for the new take on the futuristic lawman, let me just say there's no comparison between the two. Sylvester Stallone's adaptation of the character boasted stylish clothing, props, and special effects. Karl Urban's has style, but it's in the form of an interesting combination of artsy cinematography and violent grit.The America of the future has been reduced to a desolate wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. The only civilizations left are overcrowded metropolitan areas called Mega Cities. Inside each of their walls, hundreds of thousands of citizens fight for some semblance of a life amongst the decay and crime.The only thing standing in the way of the gangs and other lawbreakers taking over the cities are the Judges. They act as judge, jury, and executioner when they encounter ""Perps."" Joseph Dredd is the most notorious Judge in Mega City One. His skills are put to the ultimate test as he and his new partner, a psychic named Anderson, are commissioned to take down a drug kingpin housed atop a sealed-up tenement where everyone is on the hunt for them.Screenwriter Alex Garland and director Pete Travis did a bang-up (literally) job of delivering a satisfying vision of 2000AD's legendary comic book character. I don't think Dredd fans could have asked for more. All the graphic violence and cynicism readers came to enjoy on the printed page is brought to vivid life with plenty of splashes of bright red to quench the bloodthirsty hordes.I'm extremely impressed with director of photography Anthony Dodd Mantle's work. He creates a beautiful balance between gut-level grime, realism, and a hyper-colored drug-induced world of art house / indie film glitz. It's a unique mash-up that works effectively within the confines of ""Dredd.""Alex Garland's screenplay is simple and to the point while staying engrossing. Everything moves along quite well until the last ten or fifteen minutes. Unfortunately, we run into some action / cop movie clich&eacute;s which don't completely ruin the experience but come dangerously close to tainting it. A simpler ending might have brought the film to a close quicker, but would have served it better in the long run.The high-definition video and audio quality is superb for ""Dredd."" The elegance of the cinematography for the film comes across strong on Blu-ray. The colors are vibrant and the picture is as clean as it should be without losing its personality. The 7.1 surround sound mix brings to life all the explosions, gunshots, and roaring motorcycles one would expect in a big-budget action film. They'll definitely keep an audience awake in a home entertainment setting.An adequate amount of special features are included in the Blu-ray edition of the movie. There are six different featurettes entitled ""Mega-City Masters,"" ""Day of Chaos: The Visual Effects of 'Dredd,'"" ""'Dredd,'"" ""Dredd's Gear,"" ""The 3rd Dimension,"" and ""Welcome to Peachtrees."" All of them are under 16 minutes and feature the cast and crew talking about different aspects of the production and the world of ""Dredd."" A ""Dredd"" motion comic prequel gives more information on drug kingpin Madeline and the slo-mo drug.Longtime enthusiasts and action movie fans will delight in the gory ultra-violence of ""Dredd."" It delivers on every level and only meanders into overly familiar territory momentarily. Great cinematography and a simple-yet-satisfying story make this recommended viewing.",4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Dredd""",1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,3592,"['Let', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'way', 'up', 'front', 'only', 'thing', '2012', 'Dredd', '1995', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'have', 'common', 'name', 'who', 'have', 'somehow', 'escaped', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'new', 'take', 'futuristic', 'lawman', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'comparison', 'two', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'adaptation', 'character', 'boasted', 'stylish', 'clothing', 'props', 'special', 'effects', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'style', 'form', 'interesting', 'combination', 'artsy', 'cinematography', 'violent', 'grit.The', 'America', 'future', 'been', 'reduced', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'known', 'Cursed', 'Earth', 'only', 'civilizations', 'left', 'are', 'overcrowded', 'metropolitan', 'areas', 'called', 'Mega', 'Cities', 'Inside', 'walls', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'citizens', 'fight', 'semblance', 'life', 'decay', 'only', 'thing', 'standing', 'way', 'gangs', 'other', 'lawbreakers', 'taking', 'cities', 'are', 'Judges', 'act', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'when', 'encounter', 'Perps', 'Joseph', 'Dredd', 'most', 'notorious', 'Judge', 'Mega', 'City', 'One', 'skills', 'are', 'put', 'ultimate', 'test', 'new', 'partner', 'psychic', 'named', 'Anderson', 'are', 'commissioned', 'take', 'down', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'housed', 'sealed-up', 'tenement', 'where', 'everyone', 'hunt', 'them.Screenwriter', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'director', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'did', 'bang-up', 'literally', 'job', 'delivering', 'satisfying', 'vision', '2000AD', 'legendary', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Dredd', 'fans', 'could', 'have', 'asked', 'more', 'graphic', 'violence', 'cynicism', 'readers', 'came', 'enjoy', 'printed', 'page', 'brought', 'vivid', 'life', 'plenty', 'splashes', 'bright', 'red', 'quench', 'bloodthirsty', 'hordes.I', ""'m"", 'extremely', 'impressed', 'director', 'photography', 'Anthony', 'Dodd', 'Mantle', 'work', 'beautiful', 'balance', 'gut-level', 'grime', 'realism', 'hyper-colored', 'drug-induced', 'world', 'art', 'house', '/', 'indie', 'film', 'glitz', 'unique', 'mash-up', 'effectively', 'confines', 'Dredd', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'screenplay', 'simple', 'point', 'staying', 'engrossing', 'Everything', 'moves', 'quite', 'well', 'last', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'Unfortunately', 'run', 'action', '/', 'cop', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'do', ""n't"", 'completely', 'ruin', 'experience', 'come', 'dangerously', 'close', 'tainting', 'simpler', 'ending', 'might', 'have', 'brought', 'film', 'close', 'quicker', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'better', 'long', 'run.The', 'high-definition', 'video', 'audio', 'quality', 'superb', 'Dredd', 'elegance', 'cinematography', 'film', 'strong', 'Blu-ray', 'colors', 'are', 'vibrant', 'picture', 'as', 'clean', 'should', 'be', 'losing', 'personality', '7.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'mix', 'brings', 'life', 'explosions', 'gunshots', 'roaring', 'motorcycles', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'big-budget', 'action', 'film', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'keep', 'audience', 'awake', 'home', 'entertainment', 'setting.An', 'adequate', 'amount', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'included', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', 'movie', 'are', 'six', 'different', 'featurettes', 'entitled', 'Mega-City', 'Masters', 'Day', 'Chaos', 'Visual', 'Effects', ""'Dredd"", ""'Dredd"", 'Dredd', 'Gear', '3rd', 'Dimension', 'Welcome', 'Peachtrees', 'are', '16', 'minutes', 'feature', 'cast', 'crew', 'talking', 'different', 'aspects', 'production', 'world', 'Dredd', 'Dredd', 'motion', 'comic', 'prequel', 'more', 'information', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'Madeline', 'slo-mo', 'drug.Longtime', 'enthusiasts', 'action', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'delight', 'gory', 'ultra-violence', 'Dredd', 'level', 'only', 'meanders', 'overly', 'familiar', 'territory', 'momentarily', 'Great', 'cinematography', 'simple-yet-satisfying', 'story', 'make', 'recommended', 'viewing']",N/A

I have pretty much enjoyed every character he's played, starting with that of Julius Caesar in the Xena TV series.  However, I wasn't sure he would be the hard-edge, muscle bound character like Sylvester Stallone's Dredd.  And he wasn't, muscle bound that is, however, he gave the character a harder edge, in my opinion than Sly did.The only drawback to this movie in my opinion, was the lack of character development, pretty much no back story, just straight to the action.  This wasn't a deal breaker for me as I did truly enjoy this movie.I would definitely be in line to see a Dredd 2 if it was released.",4,Pleasant Surprise,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",2014,827,"['was', 'little', 'skeptical', 'watch', 'reboot', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'simply', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'reboot', 'would', 'do', 'justice', 'pun', 'intended', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'am', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'fan', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'character', 'played', 'starting', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'Xena', 'TV', 'series', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'hard-edge', 'muscle', 'character', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'Dredd', 'was', ""n't"", 'muscle', 'however', 'gave', 'character', 'harder', 'edge', 'opinion', 'Sly', 'only', 'drawback', 'movie', 'opinion', 'was', 'lack', 'character', 'development', 'pretty', 'much', 'back', 'story', 'just', 'straight', 'action', 'was', ""n't"", 'deal', 'breaker', 'did', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'movie.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'line', 'see', 'Dredd', '2', 'was', 'released']",N/A
1483343,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B005LAII80,FNDNreview,"[0, 0]","Transferring a comic book character to the big screen can pretty tricky business if the right people aren't at the helm.  If the script doesn't get the tone of the character right, it doesn't matter who the director or actors are in the film, because it's doomed to fail.  For example, Green Lantern (2011) was always doomed to fail.  It didn't matter if Ryan Reynolds sucked as Hal Jordan or not (and he did) because the script didn't do the character justice.  In 2012, Judge Dredd returned to the big screen in Dredd, which was recently released on DVD/Blu-ray, and it's perfectly evident that screenwriter Alex Garland didn't do this comic book character any favors, either.Before we get to the review of Dredd, let's do a quick review and background check on this character, known as Judge Dredd.  For those that don't remember or didn't bother to watch Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Judge Dredd in Judge Dredd (1995), this character is a masked (helmet) street judge in Mega-City One, a variation of a New York City-like urban area after it has been devastated by a Soviet nuclear attack.  Judge Joseph Dredd is a famous/notorious street cop (known as a judge) that patrols the streets and serves as judge, jury, and executioner after apprehending a criminal.  He carries a multi-function gun, known as a ""lawgiver,"" and patrols the city on a motorcycle, called a ""lawmaster.""  He is a ruthlessly affective officer, unbending with his judgments, and incorruptible.In Dredd (2012), Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is given the task of evaluating a rookie judge in training, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby).  Anderson, a powerful ""mutant"" psychic, must pass a final test and assist Dredd in the investigation of a new drug, ""Slo-Mo,"" which severely hampers a user's concept of time.  Responding to a building after a drug-related murder, they apprehend a drug thug for questioning.  Dredd and Anderson identify Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a drug lord, as the one responsible for the spread of ""Slo-Mo.""  And, while attempting to bring the drug thug suspect in for questioning, Ma-Ma traps Dredd and Anderson in the building, ordering their deaths.  Cue the action scenes.Unlike the 1995 rendition of Judge Dredd, this new version of Dredd doesn't delve into the past of the Dredd character, or even the Dredd universe.  This 2012 rendition feels more like a sequel than it does the first film in a reboot series.  That's not to say Dredd is a horrible film, but you have to question the thought process of making this film prior to bringing it to the big screen.  Aside from a short monologue at the beginning of the film or unless viewers have read the comics and/or saw the Stallone film version, viewers will be scratching their heads asking themselves if they missed something.  Had the creators made an origin story explaining the characters, explaining the destruction of the city, and the unique politics of this wasteland government, then Dredd would have served its purpose as a very healthy sequel.  Instead, this film creates more disappointment than excitement.For the moment, let's put those questions aside and move on to the film as it currently stands.  Karl Urban brings the cold, calculating Dredd to life in ways that Stallone never did.  Urban is far less comical than Stallone, while Urban's portrayal is far more bold and serious, which is more like the comic book character and less like what viewers were treated to in 1995.  Since Dredd's face is never seen on screen (only true to the comic book), you may never know it's Karl Urban under the helmet - unless you're able to identify people by their chin.  As far as the supporting cast goes, Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey leave a great deal to be desired.  Going back to the earlier point - there's very little actors/actresses can do with a weakly written script.  This is obviously not a dialogue heavy film, as it focuses much more on the action aspect with constant gunfire and relentless explosions.Overall, Judge Dredd is little-know character that was given a misguided return to the big screen.  There's plenty of action to go around in this film, so that's a plus for action junkies.  However, other than that, this film contains unmemorable acting, a clumsy plot, and to make matters even worse - since the film was shot in 3D, there's an abundance of overused, slow-motion drug scenes that are extremely tedious and unnecessary.Overall Film Grade:  C+FNDNreview.com",3,'DREDD 3D' an underappreciated reboot,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",2013,4451,"['Transferring', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'big', 'screen', 'can', 'pretty', 'tricky', 'business', 'right', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'helm', 'script', ""n't"", 'get', 'tone', 'character', 'right', ""n't"", 'matter', 'who', 'director', 'actors', 'are', 'film', 'doomed', 'fail', 'example', 'Green', 'Lantern', '2011', 'was', 'always', 'doomed', 'fail', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'Ryan', 'Reynolds', 'sucked', 'Hal', 'Jordan', 'not', 'did', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'character', 'justice', '2012', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'returned', 'big', 'screen', 'Dredd', 'was', 'recently', 'released', 'DVD/Blu-ray', 'perfectly', 'evident', 'screenwriter', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'favors', 'get', 'review', 'Dredd', 'let', 'do', 'quick', 'review', 'background', 'check', 'character', 'known', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'portrayal', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Judge', 'Dredd', '1995', 'character', 'masked', 'helmet', 'street', 'judge', 'Mega-City', 'One', 'variation', 'New', 'York', 'City-like', 'urban', 'area', 'been', 'devastated', 'Soviet', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'Judge', 'Joseph', 'Dredd', 'famous/notorious', 'street', 'cop', 'known', 'judge', 'streets', 'serves', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'apprehending', 'criminal', 'multi-function', 'gun', 'known', 'lawgiver', 'city', 'motorcycle', 'called', 'lawmaster', 'ruthlessly', 'affective', 'officer', 'unbending', 'judgments', 'incorruptible.In', 'Dredd', '2012', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'given', 'task', 'evaluating', 'rookie', 'judge', 'training', 'Cassandra', 'Anderson', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'Anderson', 'powerful', 'mutant', 'psychic', 'must', 'pass', 'final', 'test', 'assist', 'Dredd', 'investigation', 'new', 'drug', 'Slo-Mo', 'severely', 'user', 'concept', 'time', 'Responding', 'building', 'drug-related', 'murder', 'apprehend', 'drug', 'thug', 'questioning', 'Dredd', 'Anderson', 'identify', 'Ma-Ma', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'drug', 'lord', 'one', 'responsible', 'spread', 'Slo-Mo', 'attempting', 'bring', 'drug', 'thug', 'suspect', 'questioning', 'Ma-Ma', 'Dredd', 'Anderson', 'building', 'ordering', 'deaths', 'Cue', 'action', '1995', 'rendition', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'new', 'version', 'Dredd', ""n't"", 'delve', 'past', 'Dredd', 'character', 'even', 'Dredd', 'universe', '2012', 'rendition', 'feels', 'more', 'sequel', 'first', 'film', 'reboot', 'series', 'not', 'say', 'Dredd', 'horrible', 'film', 'have', 'question', 'thought', 'process', 'making', 'film', 'prior', 'bringing', 'big', 'screen', 'Aside', 'short', 'monologue', 'beginning', 'film', 'viewers', 'have', 'read', 'comics', 'and/or', 'saw', 'Stallone', 'film', 'version', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'scratching', 'heads', 'asking', 'missed', 'something', 'Had', 'creators', 'made', 'origin', 'story', 'explaining', 'characters', 'explaining', 'destruction', 'city', 'unique', 'politics', 'wasteland', 'government', 'then', 'Dredd', 'would', 'have', 'served', 'purpose', 'very', 'healthy', 'sequel', 'Instead', 'film', 'more', 'disappointment', 'excitement.For', 'moment', 'let', 'put', 'questions', 'aside', 'move', 'film', 'currently', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'cold', 'calculating', 'Dredd', 'life', 'ways', 'Stallone', 'never', 'did', 'Urban', 'far', 'less', 'comical', 'Stallone', 'Urban', 'portrayal', 'far', 'more', 'bold', 'serious', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'character', 'less', 'what', 'viewers', 'were', 'treated', '1995', 'Dredd', 'face', 'never', 'seen', 'screen', 'only', 'true', 'comic', 'book', 'may', 'never', 'know', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'helmet', ""'re"", 'able', 'identify', 'people', 'chin', 'As', 'far', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'leave', 'great', 'deal', 'be', 'desired', 'Going', 'back', 'earlier', 'point', 'very', 'little', 'actors/actresses', 'can', 'do', 'weakly', 'written', 'script', 'obviously', 'not', 'dialogue', 'heavy', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'aspect', 'constant', 'gunfire', 'relentless', 'explosions.Overall', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'little-know', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'misguided', 'return', 'big', 'screen', 'plenty', 'action', 'go', 'around', 'film', 'plus', 'action', 'junkies', 'However', 'other', 'film', 'unmemorable', 'acting', 'clumsy', 'plot', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '3D', 'abundance', 'overused', 'slow-motion', 'drug', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'tedious', 'unnecessary.Overall', 'Film', 'Grade', 'C+FNDNreview.com']",N/A

Not only is it a bit more accurate in comparison to the comics, but I also felt that Karl Urban made a much better Dredd as well.As far as how well it follows the comics, I am not a hundred percent sure because I am honestly not incredible familiar with them...I have only ever read scattered issues before.  However, according to what I have read and heard, this movie follows a few of the comics much better than the original one did.  In fact, as I have read, about the only thing that resembled the comics much at all in the old movie was the view of Megacity One, which was probably about the only thing the new Dredd differed on, giving it more of a feel of District 9, and that's what I thought of 2 when I saw much of what it showed of Megacity One.Once the movie moves into the tower where much of the movie takes place, it has more of a feel of the original Die Hard and The Raid Redemption from there on out...a little bit Robocop.  The action is good and the movie is altogether engaging and enjoyable.One thing I've come to understand about Judge Dredd as far as the comics go, it's very very rare that he ever takes his helmet off, and in this movie he really doesn't.  You see him ever so briefly from behind in the beginning of the movie with his helmet off, but it's on the entire rest of the movie.  The original fell short in that sense too because Stallone is not wearing the helmet for at least half the movie.  Not only that but the movie, as far as I know and have read, did not follow the comics hardly at all.  I still gave the original a decent rating because I enjoyed it overall, but as far as I know it fails as far as it's ties to the comics.This is the best of the 2 though in my opinion, and I really hope that they make at least one or two more of them, so long as the same characters star in them.  The only words of warning I will give is to those of you who are squeemish or don't like heavy violence & gore...stay away from this one.  There is one or two pretty brutal parts and we aren't spared from gore with each person that dies.  However, for those of you sci-fi & action buffs like myself or fans of the comic that aren't phased by gore, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch, if not a buy!

It bothered me a little that we never saw Dredd's full face - it made him seem like he was supposed to be a generic character. His overly breathy/creaky voice (like a character out of a 1940s film noir) furthered the impression. Maybe that's what they were going for?The rookie cop is pretty easy on the eyes. We never see her wearing the judge helmet. There is some plot device about it making it too hard for her to use her senses. This works out okay, because there is only so much emotion Dredd can pump out without us being able to see his eyes. She also figures out pretty early on that Dredd's primary motivation is that he's a psycho. This is not surprising, given what he spends all day doing, and his permanent frown.The environments are nicely put together. If you want to spend a while looking at the dystopian future, this is worth a rent. Since they put some effort into making the graphics nice, get it in HD if you have something capable of 1080p.

Other action films are content to simply blow stuff up without a second thought, and never going further then that.  It's the rare action film that manages to find a balance between the two, and ""Dredd"" manages to hit that sweet spot.Taking place in the late 21rst century, ""Dredd"" follows the exploits of Judge Dredd, who fights for law and order in a chaotic post-apocalyptic city where crime runs rampant.  While taking out a rookie cop on a routine patrol, Dredd finds himself trapped in a high-rise tower with a literal army of criminals eager to take him down.  Little do they know that they might just be the hunted, rather then the hunter.What's most surprising about ""Dredd"" is that it feels exactly like an 80's action flick, complete with a dystopian future, lots of gunfire, hard-boiled cops taking on psychopaths, and a story centered about drugs.  And that's what ""Dredd"" aspires to be: a really solid action film, and in that, it succeeds.  Its pace is steady, the story is good, the acting is good, the production values and the look of the film are high, and it mettles out enough action and justice to keep the audience satisfied, while even tossing in little moments of moral ambiguity in how law and justice can really even be applied to such a hellish world (how do you react when two kids come at you with guns?).What truly surprises me is that ""Dredd"" has no real weak spots.  It is, in all ways, a very solid 80's action movie that just happened to be made almost thirty years after that era.  Solid and with its own brand of charm that only comes in seeing criminal scumbags being blown away by equally tough cops, it's a genuine treat for action fans who don't mind a little bit of intellectual charm to go with all the gunshots.",4,Not Dreaddful at all,1348358400,"09 23, 2012",2012,1904,"['When', 'action', 'movies', 'seem', 'be', 'two', 'kinds', 'go', 'philosophical', 'issues', 'explore', 'deeper', 'aspects', 'being', 'human', 'Other', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'content', 'simply', 'blow', 'stuff', 'up', 'second', 'thought', 'never', 'going', 'further', 'then', 'rare', 'action', 'film', 'find', 'balance', 'two', 'Dredd', 'hit', 'sweet', 'spot.Taking', 'place', 'late', '21rst', 'century', 'Dredd', 'exploits', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'who', 'law', 'order', 'chaotic', 'post-apocalyptic', 'city', 'where', 'crime', 'rampant', 'taking', 'out', 'rookie', 'cop', 'routine', 'patrol', 'Dredd', 'trapped', 'high-rise', 'tower', 'literal', 'army', 'criminals', 'eager', 'take', 'down', 'Little', 'do', 'know', 'might', 'just', 'be', 'hunted', 'rather', 'then', 'hunter.What', 'most', 'surprising', 'Dredd', 'exactly', '80', 'action', 'flick', 'complete', 'dystopian', 'future', 'lots', 'gunfire', 'hard-boiled', 'cops', 'taking', 'psychopaths', 'story', 'centered', 'drugs', 'what', 'Dredd', 'be', 'really', 'solid', 'action', 'film', 'pace', 'steady', 'story', 'good', 'acting', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'look', 'film', 'are', 'high', 'out', 'enough', 'action', 'justice', 'keep', 'audience', 'satisfied', 'even', 'tossing', 'little', 'moments', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'how', 'law', 'justice', 'can', 'really', 'even', 'be', 'applied', 'such', 'hellish', 'world', 'how', 'do', 'react', 'when', 'two', 'kids', 'come', 'guns', 'truly', 'surprises', 'Dredd', 'real', 'weak', 'spots', 'ways', 'very', 'solid', '80', 'action', 'movie', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'made', 'almost', 'thirty', 'years', 'era', 'Solid', 'own', 'brand', 'charm', 'only', 'seeing', 'criminal', 'scumbags', 'being', 'blown', 'away', 'equally', 'tough', 'cops', 'genuine', 'treat', 'action', 'fans', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'little', 'bit', 'intellectual', 'charm', 'go', 'gunshots']",N/A

The Stallone version was large and enthralling. The latest version is contrived and overly in love with the slow motion violence that little gamer boys love.

They could have covered him and had a voice over and gotten as good if not better performance. the actor was never seen, (unlike the little girl who was the focus of the movie)and he was simply used as an accessory, like a purse. Non of the Judge Dred storyline was used and the film had none of the massive reality of the cursed earth and why these people were herded into this city. It was just intended to be a two advertisment for a video game and it failed badly. Weak writing, incredibly weak directing and wasted acting talent. It cost $190 million and made $37 million world wide.

I didn't expect much out of this to begin with and I picked it up for only $5 and I figure it was maybe worth that, but I regret not buying something more interesting. The action was okay and Urban did okay as Dredd, but there was really no plot to the movie. There was a slight story but they tried to focus more on how much blood and gore they could squeeze into the 90 minutes instead.I know a ton of people complain about it, but I really did enjoy the old movie far better than this remake. At least it had a decent storyline to it and it made it more interesting. I personally liked Stallone better as Dredd too.

1483422,AXYEW4EJR2BIA,B005LAII80,"Jonathan ""cinematicaddiction&#8228;com""","[3, 5]","Dredd is a futuristic SciFi action film that takes place in Mega-City One, a large metropolis with 800 million residents and 17,000 crimes reported daily. Judges keep order and work as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is evaluating a powerful psychic and potential new Judge, Cassandra; they end up in Peach Trees, a 200-story apartment-like building, where they face off against the powerful drug lord, Ma-Ma. (the story is a bit deeper than that, but I'll keep it short.) Dredd is an action-packed, ultra-violent SciFi blast that oozes style.Dredd's story is fairly simple, but great, nonetheless. After a routine stop, Dredd and Cassandra become trapped in the building and must fight to survive, and move up the gigantic building to stop the sinister drug lord, Ma-Ma. The film introduces a drug called ""Slow-Mo"", which makes the user perceive time at 1% of normal. This effect is used to create spectacular action sequences and stunning visuals; this effect is also used often and is never abandoned, so it never feels like a concept or test. Another plus is the variety the film has, from the ""slow-mo"" scenes to the tense showdowns, it really packs in a lot for 1hr and 30min. The film stays consistent throughout, without a dull moment; this is complimented by its ferocious pace. The film is very bloody, very gory, and very detailed, especially during the ""Slow-Mo"" scenes; this is a pure action film, without restrictions or limits, and I like that. The acting was great in this film. The music matched the atmosphere of the film. The cinematography and visuals were amazing.Overall, Dredd is a superb SciFi action film, with nonstop-action, spectacular effects and visuals, and amazing execution; definitely entertaining, and one of the best time-killers you can watch, thanks to its short runtime and consistent pace.

1483423,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B005LAII80,Jon Thompson,"[0, 8]","I was curious about this film, considering the hints at how interesting the universe in which it takes place, post-Appocolyptic Earth in the only remaining mega-city appeared to be as presented in the original version which starred Sylvester Stallone. Unfortunately that version approached the material with a thick coating of ""camp"", perhaps an attempt to make it feel like a comic book and slough off some of the excessive violence that are a basic part of that future dystopia.That film was based on the premise of Judge Dredd being pulled into a conspiracy to take over all remaining fragments of the law by your typical psychopathic ex-Judge escaped from prison and bent on revenge against the whole world.The current film chose to take a more realistic tack, giving the entire world a hard coating of grit, grime and decay and discarded the attempts a humor the first film found itself relying on to make it paletable.But as I sat through it, I realized why it had been released and instantly crashed at the box office.This is simply a terribly unpleasant thing to watch.Not that its poorly produced or shot. It isn't. The production values are first rate and the effects are amazing.What makes it difficult to endure is a combination of the bland storyline and an overload of meaningless violence.While the Stallone film had a moderately interesting storyline, this one feels more like an episode of ""Cops"" from the distant future. It's basically nothing more than a drug bust in a really, REALLY bad neighborhood gone wrong, winding up in a massive seige and hostage situation. The fact that the nieghborhood is a single massive high rise that can seal itself with massive blast doors, thus trapping the Judges and the perpetrators inside is the only reason this film exists.Actually, the true only reason is so the producers could set up the bloodiest, most grusome, most distasteful collection of violence ever filmed. It's nothing more than a ""first person shooter"" game that you can only observe, not play. ""Innocent civilians"" are there only to be killed in horrific ways and by the dozen.The fact that the effects are so detailed and realistic only makes it all the more difficult to watch. I found it producing the same vague, disquieting feelings I get when I observe the heaps of bodies recorded in old Nazi Holocaust footage.In short, this is one of the most heartless, cold and disturbing films I've seen in quite some time, primarily because there is no transcendant or uplifting point needing to be made. It is just grusome violence for its own sake to the point of being marginally pornographic.The very fact that so many people find it exciting or entertaining is, in itself, very disturbing. The fact that I also was impressed by the precision and realism of the violence makes me feel a little guilty.My thoughts are, if you do watch this film and don't find yourself at least thinking ""enough already"" long before it ends, you should perhaps worry about your own store of human empathy not being quite as strong as it should be.If you think it's great and you want to watch it again and again, I pray you never get your hands on a firearm. It's that disturbing.

1483427,A168KINQ59CZOZ,B005LAII80,Josh B.,"[1, 1]","First off I have to say Karl Urban absolutely owns this movie as Judge Dredd. Casting him was the best choice they could have possibly made for this movie, as he is an actual Judge Dredd comics fan, so he gets the character. And it absolutely shows in his performance.This movie is just like a roller coaster. Just pure non-stop action from start to finish and you never want it to end. Yes people, it is ultra-violent as its rated R. You should know that going into this. If you can't handle these kind of movies, just stay away and go watch The Little Mermaid or Twilight for yourself and don't come here complaining about its rating and violence. Its just a movie get over yourselves.The 3D here is pretty good, I would put in on par with The Amazing Spider-Man's if you have seen that movie. Its average for most of the movie but during the slo-mo scenes its actually pretty good. The DTS-HD Master audio here though is fantastic, and the movies soundtrack is beyond fantastic. It definitely will give your home theater system a workout and sounds great doing so. Combine the 3D with the amazing sound and you have yourself an amazing immersive experience.

1483428,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B005LAII80,"J. Paul ""John doe""","[0, 0]","This is sort of special review cause I was recommended this movie when I was watching a couple of rant videos on for The Robocop remake on youtube. I saw that movie it was awful even as it's own movie it's a cliche dull run of the mill super hero origin corrupt cop drama & overall just a bad movie. People think I am against reboots while I am against going & redoing movies I love if the movie had something going for it or whatever bogged the movie down then yes I will support a remake case in point the 1995 Judge Dredd movie is 1 of the 1st Stallone movies I saw & while there's things I like about it & it's an ok movie it's flawed. I'll do a 20 years ago review next year for that movie on my newer account. Anyway Dredd came out in September of 2012 made for $45 or $50 million imdb says 1 thing & Wikiapedia says another but the movie made only $6 million it's opening opening weekend only made $13 million in The US & only $41 million worldwide. which is a f*  *  * ing shame when cliche ridden pos's like The Rubberman movie aka Robocop remake make $144 MILLION & DOESN'T EVENF  *  *  *IN DESERVE IT! The movie was directed by Pete Travis which this has been the only movie of his I have seen. It stars Karl Urban as Judge Dredd, Oliva Thirlby as Judge Anderson, Lean Headey as Ma Ma, Warrick Grier as Caleb & Wood Harris as Kay. Story is about this city in The North East called Mega City One crime is rampant & there's a new drug on the streets called Slow Mo which it gives the user the feel like times slowing down. Watching this movie I can see why in spirit people feels like the original Robocop. Anyway Dredd is on patrol & is chasing down these guys who are murders. The perps he's chasing after hit a pedestrian & this movie isn't afraid to show gore it's not a safe PG 13 movie to appeal to audiences which from what I have been told about the comics it's R rated material. Dredd tells command that he's going to have to sentence them to death after running over a civilian. Dredd shoots the van causing it to flip over those guys are done for then there's a shooting going on in this Mall Food Court area where this guy has killed some people he's holding a worker at gun point Dredd tells him if he lets her go then all he will get is life no parole he refuses & uses a bullet called hotshot shoots him in the mouth & his head burns from the inside out & The CGI isn't too bad in this movie. Dredd gets an assignment to evaluate this rookie Judge named Anderson she lost her parents when she was a kid & she is a Psychic which helps with their mission. Your introduced to the villain named Ma Ma who basically has control of this Highrise called The Peach Trees. There is 3 rival gang members Ma Ma orders her men to throw them down 200 stories. 2 of her men are sort of right hand men named Kay & Caleb. They torture them get them high on Slow Mo & toss them down. When Dredd & Anderson respond to the crime scene you see 1 of the people that were thrown down the back of his head is busted open & his brains are splattered on the ground. They find out information about Ma Man & how crazy she is she even feminized Kay with her teeth so they go back to The Peach Trees where they find Kay & they're going to take him in but there's this computer tech that finds out there are Judges in the building he tells Ma Ma has him shut the building down Ma Ma has wave after wave after wave of thugs to kill The Judges basically Dredd & Anderson are working their way up to Ma Ma. So Dredd has to use his Lawgiver Gun & few other surprises to survive. Like using gas gernades so he can take down 1 wave of thugs & when there's another wave he uses a stun gernade but 1st he gives them a chance to surrender they refuse & he sets the stun gernade off which has blinding light & Dredd & Anderson take them down. They try to get into this Medic Room but the guy inside won't let them in. You have this guy that is still alive Anderson is conflicted in shooting this man Dredd tells her that he tried to kill us so he needs to be executed which Anderson shoots him in the head. Later on when they're using cover in an Apartment she sees a picture of the woman that lives there & a man it turns out she killed this Woman's Husband. When Dredd & Anderson get to the 76th floor Ma Ma has it locked down she has her gang set up these Vulcan Cannons the firepower of these guns tear through walls shoots up innocent people you have Dredd make a run for it Dredd finds a way outside they get outside you have Caleb looking for Dredd among the bodies Dredd kills his group then he takes Caleb & drops 76 stories down. Dredd beats the c  rap out of Kay Anderson finds out what Kay knows there is drug lab in the building which these mind reading scenes are kind of cool. Dredd calls for back up & Ma Ma holds knife to the computer tech's stomach basically she's going to gut this guy if she doesn't do what she says. He tells The Judges he can't open the door cause the place is sealed up cause of a fire. Then you have scene where a couple of kids confront Dredd & Anderson & they have guns Kay breaks free & takes Anderson Dredd uses a taser on those 2 kids instead of using deadly force. Kay takes Anderson to the 200th floor Ma Ma wants it to be over. Dredd gets on The PA System to tell the people ""In case you people have forgotten, this block operates under the same rules as the rest of the city. Ma Ma is not the law... I am the law. Ma Ma is a common criminal guilty of murder, guilty of manufacture & the distribution of the narcotic known as Slow Mo & is uncder sentence of death. Any who obstruct me in carrying out my duty will be treated as an accessory to he crimes... & as for you Ma Ma judgement time."" You have this wave of thugs that are burned alive Dredd uses a type of ammo that spreads & catches an are on fire. These dudes get BBQ'd. Ma Ma calls in some corrupt Judges these 4 are assigned to go after Dredd. Dredd happens to run into 1 of them he knows something is up so he's dealt with. Anderson escapes when Kay is going to use her Lawgiver Gun only it doesn't read his DNA & it explodes blowing his hand right off in a good gore effect. As I said The CGI wasn't actually good & didn't look cartooney. Anderson goes through the hall shoots up these guys. Meanwhile Dredd finds the drug lab he clears it & then faces off against these 2 Corrupt Judges. Dredd uses this type of bullet called High Ex it reduces this guy to nothing. Anderson runs into this the 4th Corrupt Judge she knows she's full of it & kills her. The remaining Corrupt Judge uses an armor piercing bullet & shoots Dredd. Dredd stalls that guy & Anderson shoots the last Corrupt Judge from behind. Dredd & Anderson go into this computer room where they find The Computer Tech & Anderson reads his mind she finds out the code to Ma Ma's room & while she was reading his mind she finds out that he is innocent so she let's him go. They get to her chamber they gun down some more of her men. They get Ma Ma's room where she sends some more of her goons on them 1 of them shoots Anderson in the shoulder. Ma Ma tells Dredd she has device on her wrist that will blow up the 150th to 200th floors if he kills her Dredd shoots her in the stomach he makes her inhale Slow Mo he tells her "" Ma Ma your crimes include multiple homicides & the manufacture & distribution of illegal narcotics. How do you plead?"" She says nothing she's so out of it. Dredd says ""Defense noted."" He tosses her out the window & she falls 200 stories to her death. She falls in slow motion which the way slow motion is used in this movie is good. Dredd informs The Chief Justice that Anderson has passed & that's pretty much the movie. Final thoughts are I have 2 characters I care about straight forward plot. Very good action scenes when people get shot there is at least blood something the people doing The Robocop remake obviously didn't take note of. Pete Travis did a good job directing. Karl Urban was good. Oliva Thirlby did a good job. Lena Headey did a good job. Wood Harris & Warrick Grier were decent right hand men. Dredd 2012 was recommended to me in rant videos on The Robocop remake I would say give it a shot too if you were at all disappointed by Rubberman as I call it.",4,Dredd 2012 review 8/10,1393372800,"02

1483429,A1QYFJP4PJMXGC,B005LAII80,"J. R. Napier ""Constant Evolution""","[0, 2]","I'll start off by saying, I am a fan of the first Judge Dredd movie.I've never read the comic but I really liked the character and the atmosphere of the Dredd world which I why I chose to watch this one.This is a Reboot of the Judge Dredd world and was more or less a hit or miss of the recreation IMHO.ProsGreat atmosphere! You really get a feel of a city in chaos in this movie.Decent characters - They did well with the casting, (I really liked the boss and her story).Good effects - (albeit reused over and over) they still looked cool.Pretty good story/setup - It's the classic one building setup (think Die Hard 1 style). I've seen it before but it doesn't lose points for lack of originality.Cons(Why I titled this More Judge, Less Dredd).Lack of back story - Where is Dredd??? You see him for 90% of the picture but you really don't know anything about him. No flashback, no word of mouth tales, no nostalgic banter between him and his rookie. Heck I ended up caring more about the Main Boss then I did about Dredd and his rookie because they told more about her back story then anyone else. In fact (I'm ashamed to say) while watching it, I actually mistook Dredd for one of the other Judges in one of the scenes because he really doesn't stand out.Less Dread - (this is nit picky but important to my personal experience) to the point above, if you are gonna leave Dredd's back story out and just make him out as a veteran Judge then make him feared as such. There is only one reference to the might of this veteran judge in the movie. I was really hoping they would amp up his legendary status, bad guys should be frozen in fear (heck peeing their pants) when they hear that judge DREDD has entered the vicinity. He is like the famous Batman, striking fear into the hearts of criminals is his primary weapon. Yet while watching the movie I felt he was only experienced but not feared.Inconsistencies (lazy story telling) - the rookie is a mind reader (maybe this was a comic thing that I missed). Okay whatever I'll go with it, she says she doesn't wear her helm (very important while bullets are flying around) because it interferes with her powers. Yet towards the end of the movie guess what she does ... yes she reads the mind of someone wearing the helmet. This could have been easily remedied with a slick ploy to get said person to remove the helm first but ... no, consider the ball dropped.This is supposed to be a lawless world, there is a scene where our cute young rookie gets placed in a perilous situation with numerous murderous thugs with intentions of ravening her. Inexplicably the cold blooded boss (breaks character) has a change of heart and orders them not to touch her. Personally I'm glad because I didn't want that to happen to her but at the same time I'm like don't put her in that position if don't want your film to take that direction. Please understand that ""You are breaking my IMMERSION."" Either this is a lawless immoral land or it's not, don't try to walk the line (again lazy story telling).Less Dredd World - I like the one tower thing, Die hard Throwback. At the same time, this meant sacrificing on a variety of bad guys and scenery. No more mutated cannibalistic scavengers in the ""cursed earth"" waste lands, no more freakishly huge robots (ohh i missed them), and was I the only person waiting for him to say ""double-whammy""?. The fact is you get very little feel for the city or the Dredd world at all because of this setup.If this was my first Judge Dredd Movie, I feel like I would have learned nothing about the (main) characters or the important footnotes of Dredd world. Again simple ploys (such as newscaster reports or rumor dialogue) could have filled in this blanks or helped flush out this expansive world that we never get to see.Over hyped slow mo effect - We get it, Matrix made it cool. Now every action movie, video game, and music video has to show the slow mo effect. Dredd introduces a new gimmick drug that allows the user to see things in slow motion. Since they can't react to what they see (which would have been cool) it just becomes a blatant ploy to show slow motion shots every so often (reference lazy story telling).All in all I would rate this 2.5/5 for completely average. It was an average tale about an experienced judge (cop) in an average setting.Worth seeing? Yes if you like action flicks, moments of hyper violence and slow motion sequences.Just expect to see more Judges and less of the world that is Dredd.",3,"More Judge, Less Dredd.",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",2013,4497,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'fan', 'first', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'movie.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'comic', 'really', 'liked', 'character', 'atmosphere', 'Dredd', 'world', 'why', 'chose', 'watch', 'one.This', 'Reboot', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'world', 'was', 'more', 'less', 'hit', 'miss', 'recreation', 'IMHO.ProsGreat', 'atmosphere', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'city', 'chaos', 'movie.Decent', 'characters', 'did', 'well', 'casting', 'really', 'liked', 'boss', 'story', '.Good', 'effects', 'reused', 'still', 'looked', 'cool.Pretty', 'good', 'story/setup', 'classic', 'one', 'building', 'setup', 'think', 'Die', 'Hard', '1', 'style', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""n't"", 'lose', 'points', 'lack', 'originality.Cons', 'Why', 'titled', 'More', 'Judge', 'Less', 'Dredd', '.Lack', 'back', 'story', 'Where', 'Dredd', 'see', '90', '%', 'picture', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'flashback', 'word', 'mouth', 'tales', 'nostalgic', 'banter', 'rookie', 'Heck', 'ended', 'up', 'caring', 'more', 'Main', 'Boss', 'then', 'did', 'about', 'Dredd', 'rookie', 'told', 'more', 'back', 'story', 'then', 'anyone', 'else', 'fact', ""'m"", 'ashamed', 'say', 'watching', 'actually', 'mistook', 'Dredd', 'one', 'other', 'Judges', 'one', 'scenes', 'really', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out.Less', 'Dread', 'nit', 'picky', 'important', 'personal', 'experience', 'point', 'are', 'gon', 'leave', 'Dredd', 'back', 'story', 'just', 'make', 'out', 'veteran', 'Judge', 'then', 'make', 'feared', 'such', 'only', 'one', 'reference', 'might', 'veteran', 'judge', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'would', 'amp', 'up', 'legendary', 'status', 'bad', 'guys', 'should', 'be', 'frozen', 'fear', 'heck', 'peeing', 'pants', 'when', 'hear', 'judge', 'DREDD', 'entered', 'vicinity', 'famous', 'Batman', 'striking', 'fear', 'hearts', 'criminals', 'primary', 'weapon', 'watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'was', 'only', 'experienced', 'not', 'feared.Inconsistencies', 'lazy', 'story', 'telling', 'rookie', 'mind', 'reader', 'maybe', 'was', 'comic', 'thing', 'missed', 'Okay', ""'ll"", 'go', ""n't"", 'wear', 'helm', 'very', 'important', 'bullets', 'are', 'flying', 'around', 'powers', 'end', 'movie', 'guess', 'what', 'yes', 'mind', 'someone', 'wearing', 'helmet', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'remedied', 'slick', 'ploy', 'get', 'said', 'person', 'remove', 'helm', 'first', 'consider', 'ball', 'dropped.This', 'supposed', 'be', 'lawless', 'world', 'scene', 'where', 'cute', 'young', 'rookie', 'placed', 'perilous', 'situation', 'numerous', 'murderous', 'thugs', 'intentions', 'ravening', 'Inexplicably', 'cold', 'blooded', 'boss', 'breaks', 'character', 'change', 'heart', 'orders', 'not', 'touch', 'Personally', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'happen', 'same', 'time', ""'m"", 'like', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'position', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'film', 'take', 'direction', 'Please', 'understand', 'are', 'breaking', 'IMMERSION', 'lawless', 'immoral', 'land', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'walk', 'line', 'again', 'lazy', 'story', 'telling', '.Less', 'Dredd', 'World', 'one', 'tower', 'thing', 'Die', 'hard', 'Throwback', 'same', 'time', 'meant', 'sacrificing', 'variety', 'bad', 'guys', 'scenery', 'more', 'mutated', 'cannibalistic', 'scavengers', 'cursed', 'earth', 'waste', 'lands', 'more', 'freakishly', 'huge', 'robots', 'i', 'missed', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'waiting', 'say', 'double-whammy', 'fact', 'get', 'very', 'little', 'feel', 'city', 'Dredd', 'world', 'setup.If', 'was', 'first', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Movie', 'feel', 'would', 'have', 'learned', 'nothing', 'main', 'characters', 'important', 'footnotes', 'Dredd', 'world', 'Again', 'simple', 'ploys', 'such', 'newscaster', 'reports', 'rumor', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'filled', 'blanks', 'helped', 'flush', 'out', 'expansive', 'world', 'never', 'get', 'see.Over', 'hyped', 'slow', 'mo', 'effect', 'get', 'Matrix', 'made', 'cool', 'Now', 'action', 'movie', 'video', 'game', 'music', 'video', 'show', 'slow', 'mo', 'effect', 'Dredd', 'new', 'gimmick', 'drug', 'user', 'see', 'things', 'slow', 'motion', 'ca', ""n't"", 'react', 'what', 'see', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'just', 'blatant', 'ploy', 'show', 'slow', 'motion', 'shots', 'so', 'often', 'reference', 'lazy', 'story', 'telling', '.All', 'would', 'rate', '2.5/5', 'completely', 'average', 'was', 'average', 'tale', 'experienced', 'judge', 'cop', 'average', 'setting.Worth', 'seeing', 'Yes', 'like', 'action', 'flicks', 'moments', 'hyper', 'violence', 'slow', 'motion', 'sequences.Just', 'expect', 'see', 'more', 'Judges', 'less', 'world', 'Dredd']",N/A

Not an all time classic or ground breaking in any way but a solid entertaining action sci fi movie. Its rated R, so for those that don't like graphic violence then this will not be your cup of tea. I was never a big fan of the Dredd comic book but I really liked this movie because of the quick pace and non stop action.  The movie was direct and to the point, no cheesy emotional bantering or cliched ra-ra super hero shenanigans, or deep artistic symbolic messages, it was just a solid action flick with cool weapons and killer fight scenes (the use of slow motion is really sweet, especially if you are watching it in 3D).  One thing to note for any 3D enthusiasts out there, the aspect ratio of the blu ray is such that it will not fill in the entire screen on a widescreen hdtv, meaning you will have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen which diminishes the 3D somewhat but not enough to reduce the enjoyment of the movie.

He's the sort of 'hero' who'll save a mugging victim, brutally beat (or kill) the perpetrators, then haul in the terrified victim for incitement (you should have known better than to wear jeweled kneepads in this neighborhood).  He's the ultimate fascist hero and in the right hands he makes us cheer for him, and then makes us uncomfortable for doing it.This movie missed that point.You can see them missing the point right there on the cover.  In the comics Dredd's uniform is outrageously over the top with a massive eagle shoulder pad and a badge the size of a dinner plate.  The attempt to make it look more realistic shows the film makers wanted a generic action hero, not a clever parody.So we got a film about a supercop shooting his way through an apartment building and beating the bad guy all in glorious 3D.  There was no sense of self-awareness or satire or even humor in the film.  Everything is just ugly and dirty and unpleasant.  I neither laughed nor cheered.I know I'll be in the minority here but just as the Stallone version went too far into parody this one went too far into the grim.

With the success of the film adaptations of Marvel characters and Batman, more comic book characters are making their way to the screen. Fans of the British comic 2000 A.D. are well acquainted with Judge Dredd. Not the one we saw years ago with Sylvester Stallone (not bad but no, not like the comic), but the comic character. Dredd is the quintessential tough guy. He takes no guff and deals out justice with extreme prejudice. So that makes him perfect for a new film, this time just known as DREDD.In the future most of the world is a desolate wasteland. Only 2 cities remain the main one of which is Mega-City One. It is a city filled with people and that means plenty of crime. Crime is so rampant in fact that they've tossed aside the old ways of doing things and now have just one authority in this world: judges. Judges fit everything into one tight package: police officer, judge and executioner. There is no need for a trial, if you break the law the judge will arrest and sentence you on the spot. If you do something as extreme as murder, your execution will take place on the streets with clean up to follow.One of the most extreme members of this police force is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban). He also happens to be the most effective officer they have. His day today will be different though as he's been assigned a special task: take a new recruit who barely passed the admissions test but has something special about her, telepathy, and rate her performance. If she's effective, she's in but if she fails, she's gone. Dredd meets up with new Judge Anderson (Olivia Thrilby) and off they go.The film goes for the usual here with the gruff old timer giving the newbie a difficult time. Their first case results in a chase involving a group of drug users racing through town. While Dredd kills a few of these criminals, the rest escape into one of the skyscraper type neighborhoods.The deaths of the criminals who escaped in a skyscraper type neighborhood leads the Judges to that building.  It turns out to be run by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), one of the most vicious criminals and drug lords in Mega City One. Ma-Ma is in the process of promoting a new drug to the streets called Slo-mo, a drug that when taken makes the user experience the world in slow motion. When she learns that the Judges have entered the building, she immediately has it shut down and locked up tight and then offers a huge reward for the first person to bring both Judges to her.This forces the Dredd and Anderson to work their way up the floors of the building in search of Ma-Ma before anyone can collect that reward. And along the way the body count rises as every criminal in the building, and there are plenty of them, tries to collect. Unfortunately for them they have yet to realize how resourceful and deadly Dredd truly is. To put it mildly, Dredd makes Dirty Harry look like a kindergarten cop.Those of you who recall the review I wrote for a film called THE RAID might think this sounds vaguely familiar and in part it is. Both films have law enforcement officials trapped in a skyscraper filled with criminals out to collect a bounty on their heads. But this one does have a number of differences. While THE RAID had a tad more realism in how its heroes found a way to survive, DREDD has the title character who is the supreme tough guy. Dredd doesn't think twice about shooting someone, he just does it. Anderson also is a plus as her telepathic abilities help them to find out more about just where they're going when they question a captive drug dealer.If you're an action fan you'll love this movie, the same for fans of the comic. Gone are the humorous touches found in the last version of Dredd, replaced by a performance that is more in line with the comic book. Urban does a fantastic job here, never once feeling the need to remove the classic helmet Dredd wears to show off his smile, grimace or anything else. This is what Dredd should look like and how he should be played. Thrilby does a nice job as well showing her frustration at being judged by someone who clearly has no use for her only to later be the sidekick that he needs.The movie is filled to the brim with movie violence. Don't rent this one not having a clue about that. Just like the comic, the movie is filled with splatter moments and the blood gushes freely here. It's not a film for the squeamish. But for movie fans, comic fans and Dredd fans, you'll enjoy this movie much more than the Stallone version.",4,"JUDGE, JURY AND EXECUTIONER",1357776000,"01 10, 2013",2013,4545,"['comics', 'have', 'become', 'mainstay', 'films', 'days', 'success', 'film', 'adaptations', 'Marvel', 'characters', 'Batman', 'more', 'comic', 'book', 'characters', 'are', 'making', 'way', 'screen', 'Fans', 'British', 'comic', '2000', 'A.D.', 'are', 'well', 'acquainted', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Not', 'one', 'saw', 'years', 'ago', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'comic', 'comic', 'character', 'Dredd', 'quintessential', 'tough', 'guy', 'guff', 'deals', 'out', 'justice', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'perfect', 'new', 'film', 'time', 'just', 'known', 'DREDD.In', 'future', 'most', 'world', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'Only', '2', 'cities', 'remain', 'main', 'one', 'Mega-City', 'One', 'city', 'filled', 'people', 'plenty', 'crime', 'Crime', 'so', 'rampant', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'tossed', 'old', 'ways', 'doing', 'things', 'now', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'authority', 'world', 'judges', 'Judges', 'fit', 'everything', 'one', 'tight', 'package', 'police', 'officer', 'judge', 'executioner', 'need', 'trial', 'break', 'law', 'judge', 'will', 'arrest', 'sentence', 'spot', 'do', 'something', 'as', 'extreme', 'murder', 'execution', 'will', 'take', 'place', 'streets', 'clean', 'follow.One', 'most', 'extreme', 'members', 'police', 'force', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'also', 'be', 'most', 'effective', 'officer', 'have', 'day', 'today', 'will', 'be', 'different', 'been', 'assigned', 'special', 'task', 'take', 'new', 'recruit', 'who', 'barely', 'passed', 'admissions', 'test', 'something', 'special', 'telepathy', 'rate', 'performance', 'effective', 'gone', 'Dredd', 'up', 'new', 'Judge', 'Anderson', 'Olivia', 'Thrilby', 'go.The', 'film', 'usual', 'here', 'gruff', 'old', 'timer', 'giving', 'newbie', 'difficult', 'time', 'first', 'case', 'results', 'chase', 'involving', 'group', 'drug', 'users', 'racing', 'town', 'Dredd', 'few', 'criminals', 'rest', 'escape', 'one', 'skyscraper', 'type', 'neighborhoods.The', 'deaths', 'criminals', 'who', 'escaped', 'skyscraper', 'type', 'neighborhood', 'Judges', 'building', 'out', 'be', 'run', 'Ma-Ma', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'one', 'most', 'vicious', 'criminals', 'drug', 'lords', 'Mega', 'City', 'One', 'Ma-Ma', 'process', 'promoting', 'new', 'drug', 'streets', 'called', 'Slo-mo', 'drug', 'when', 'taken', 'user', 'experience', 'world', 'slow', 'motion', 'When', 'Judges', 'have', 'entered', 'building', 'immediately', 'shut', 'down', 'locked', 'up', 'tight', 'then', 'huge', 'reward', 'first', 'person', 'bring', 'Judges', 'her.This', 'forces', 'Dredd', 'Anderson', 'work', 'way', 'floors', 'building', 'search', 'Ma-Ma', 'anyone', 'can', 'collect', 'reward', 'way', 'body', 'count', 'criminal', 'building', 'are', 'plenty', 'collect', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'yet', 'realize', 'how', 'resourceful', 'deadly', 'Dredd', 'truly', 'put', 'mildly', 'Dredd', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'look', 'kindergarten', 'cop.Those', 'who', 'recall', 'review', 'wrote', 'film', 'called', 'THE', 'RAID', 'might', 'think', 'vaguely', 'familiar', 'part', 'films', 'have', 'law', 'enforcement', 'officials', 'trapped', 'skyscraper', 'filled', 'criminals', 'out', 'collect', 'bounty', 'heads', 'one', 'have', 'number', 'differences', 'THE', 'RAID', 'had', 'tad', 'more', 'realism', 'how', 'heroes', 'found', 'way', 'survive', 'DREDD', 'title', 'character', 'who', 'supreme', 'tough', 'guy', 'Dredd', ""n't"", 'think', 'twice', 'shooting', 'someone', 'just', 'Anderson', 'also', 'plus', 'telepathic', 'abilities', 'help', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'about', 'just', 'where', ""'re"", 'going', 'when', 'question', 'captive', 'drug', 'dealer.If', ""'re"", 'action', 'fan', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie', 'same', 'fans', 'comic', 'Gone', 'are', 'humorous', 'touches', 'found', 'last', 'version', 'Dredd', 'replaced', 'performance', 'more', 'line', 'comic', 'book', 'Urban', 'fantastic', 'job', 'here', 'never', 'once', 'feeling', 'need', 'remove', 'classic', 'helmet', 'Dredd', 'show', 'off', 'smile', 'grimace', 'anything', 'else', 'what', 'Dredd', 'should', 'look', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'played', 'Thrilby', 'nice', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'showing', 'frustration', 'being', 'judged', 'someone', 'who', 'clearly', 'use', 'only', 'later', 'be', 'sidekick', 'needs.The', 'movie', 'filled', 'brim', 'movie', 'violence', 'Do', ""n't"", 'rent', 'one', 'not', 'having', 'clue', 'Just', 'comic', 'movie', 'filled', 'splatter', 'moments', 'blood', 'gushes', 'freely', 'here', 'not', 'film', 'squeamish', 'movie', 'fans', 'comic', 'fans', 'Dredd', 'fans', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'Stallone', 'version']",N/A

Olivia Thirlby is pretty good too, mixing a vulnerability with a hard edged confidence as well. She plays a psychic with a magical realism that you don't often see in these characters and has a great psychic standoff with a criminal. Lena Headey could have been given more to do.But let's be real, it's not meant to be a thoughtful and intriguing rumination on government and police (although there is a lot of potential for that) It's an action film.

1483484,AZZ4GD20C58ND,B005LAII80,M. Brookes,"[1, 2]","I enjoyed watching this film again, I was a big fan of the comics as a youngster and this a decent adaptation. As well as that it is a decent action film. It's set in the future where most of America is an irradiated wasteland, Mega City One is a vast city housing most of the remaining population. The city is rife with crime, things are so bad that the judges are empowered as judge, jury and executioners as needed. A new drug called slow-mo (which also provides a nice reason for some of the special effects) has hit the streets and as part of this three pushers are murdered. Judge Dredd and a rookie called Anderson investigate the murders and find themselves trapped inside the block. They then have to battle their way out.The set up is very similar to The Raid (another excellent action film) and while the story isn't particularly unique it is sufficient to keep things interesting through the film.For me the real problem was the setting, it didn't really fill the fantasy created in the comics. It has glimpses of it, but for the most part is little different from a modern environment. This in part  reflects the low budget for the film.However it's strengths far outweigh that minor complaint. The main plus for me was Dredd himself, Karl Urban does portray the character I imagined while reading the comics. The other characters are also well played, Anderson contrasts well with Dredd as the rookie judge being assessed.This is a fun film, worth watching even if you don't know the comics and a fair adaptation if you have.",4,Decent adaptation and a fun action film,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",2013,1539,"['enjoyed', 'watching', 'film', 'again', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'comics', 'youngster', 'decent', 'adaptation', 'As', 'well', 'decent', 'action', 'film', 'set', 'future', 'where', 'most', 'America', 'irradiated', 'wasteland', 'Mega', 'City', 'One', 'vast', 'city', 'housing', 'most', 'remaining', 'population', 'city', 'rife', 'crime', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'judges', 'are', 'empowered', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioners', 'needed', 'new', 'drug', 'called', 'slow-mo', 'also', 'nice', 'reason', 'special', 'effects', 'hit', 'streets', 'part', 'three', 'pushers', 'are', 'murdered', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'rookie', 'called', 'Anderson', 'investigate', 'murders', 'find', 'trapped', 'block', 'then', 'have', 'battle', 'way', 'out.The', 'set', 'up', 'very', 'similar', 'Raid', 'excellent', 'action', 'film', 'story', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'unique', 'sufficient', 'keep', 'things', 'interesting', 'film.For', 'real', 'problem', 'was', 'setting', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'fill', 'fantasy', 'created', 'comics', 'glimpses', 'most', 'part', 'little', 'different', 'modern', 'environment', 'part', 'low', 'budget', 'film.However', 'strengths', 'far', 'outweigh', 'minor', 'complaint', 'main', 'plus', 'was', 'Dredd', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'portray', 'character', 'imagined', 'reading', 'comics', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'played', 'Anderson', 'well', 'Dredd', 'rookie', 'judge', 'being', 'assessed.This', 'fun', 'film', 'watching', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'comics', 'fair', 'adaptation', 'have']",N/A

The humor is gone as this movie settles into a dark and foreboding future of a world mostly wasted beyond ruin and a concentrated mass of humanity in what are known as mega cities (800 million people and 17,000 crimes per day). But don't worry for the judges are here to run things playing judge, jury and executioner and being allowed to kill people on site for violating various laws.Tale opens with Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban) being given the task of training a rookie with psychic powers named Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) who failed her exam to become a judge. She gets one more chance training under judge.And thus do they come to investigating a drug den in a highrise. Guess what? Not surprisingly it's worse than they thought and the villains seal them in and try to wipe them out. Minor spoiler but I'm adding some details so that it might sound enticing enough to watch.Judge Dredd creator John Wagner, who had been critical of the 1995 adaptation, gave a positive review of Dredd. He said: ""I liked the movie. It was, unlike the first film, a true representation of Judge Dredd ... Karl Urban was a fine Dredd and I'd be more than happy to see him in the follow-up. Olivia Thirlby excelled as Anderson ... The character and storyline are pure Dredd."" (Wiki)Screenwriter Alex Garland started working on the script in 2006.The budget for this film was $45M and it made just a bit over $36M at the Box Office. Quite a disappointment from what some were expecting. However, it did well with home media and because it pushed over $50M gross a trilogy is in the works or so Garland claimed.SOUND/MUSIC: B plus to A minus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING:B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus to A minus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2013.",4,MY GRADE: B plus.,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",2013,2000,"['movie', 'very', 'good', 'more', 'viewing', 'got', 'theaters.Dredd', 'back', 'much', 'grimmer', 'when', 'Sly', 'played', 'earlier', 'version', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'humor', 'gone', 'movie', 'dark', 'foreboding', 'future', 'world', 'mostly', 'wasted', 'ruin', 'concentrated', 'mass', 'humanity', 'what', 'are', 'known', 'mega', 'cities', '800', 'million', 'people', '17,000', 'crimes', 'day', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'judges', 'are', 'here', 'run', 'things', 'playing', 'judge', 'jury', 'executioner', 'being', 'allowed', 'kill', 'people', 'site', 'violating', 'various', 'laws.Tale', 'opens', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'played', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'being', 'given', 'task', 'training', 'rookie', 'psychic', 'powers', 'named', 'Anderson', 'played', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'who', 'failed', 'exam', 'become', 'judge', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'training', 'judge.And', 'thus', 'do', 'come', 'investigating', 'drug', 'den', 'highrise', 'Guess', 'what', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'worse', 'thought', 'villains', 'seal', 'try', 'wipe', 'out', 'Minor', 'spoiler', ""'m"", 'adding', 'details', 'might', 'sound', 'enticing', 'enough', 'watch.Judge', 'Dredd', 'creator', 'John', 'Wagner', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'critical', '1995', 'adaptation', 'gave', 'positive', 'review', 'Dredd', 'said', 'liked', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'true', 'representation', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'was', 'fine', 'Dredd', ""'d"", 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'see', 'follow-up', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'excelled', 'Anderson', 'character', 'storyline', 'are', 'pure', 'Dredd', 'Wiki', 'Screenwriter', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'started', 'working', 'script', '2006.The', 'budget', 'film', 'was', '45M', 'made', 'just', 'bit', '36M', 'Box', 'Office', 'disappointment', 'what', 'were', 'expecting', 'However', 'did', 'well', 'home', 'media', 'pushed', '50M', 'gross', 'trilogy', 'works', 'so', 'Garland', 'claimed.SOUND/MUSIC', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'CINEMATOGRAPHY', 'B', 'B', 'STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING', 'B', 'B', 'CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE', 'B', 'ACTION', 'SCENES', 'B', 'A', 'minus', 'OVERALL', 'GRADE', 'B', 'WHEN', 'WATCHED', 'mid', 'January', '2013']",N/A

There is nothing 'super' about him, one might say 'hey, Batman doesn't has super power either', but to me his nearly unbelievable fortune that back him doing what he's doing is the 'super power', by the definition that super power meaning a power source that is unreal, and in his case, his financial and technological support is unreal.This Dredd, however, too 'real' as a super hero, besides he's living in a near future environment, he's just a cop.

1483502,AV252YPWNODEV,B005LAII80,M. Oliver,"[0, 1]","Judge Dredd as a comic anti-hero should translate better to the movies than the first two attempts.  At least in the first version of the movie, Stalone took his helmet off and was semi-human.  In this version Karl Urban, who is actually very good in these types of movies (loved him in The Chronicles of Riddick) never takes his helmet off, and just walks around as a semi-automaton, shooting stuff up.Judge Dredd reflects a future where crime is so pervasive that the justice system has combined the primary law functions into a single human - if you can call them that.  The woman who plays his mentee/cadet starts out human - too human, and eventually becomes another uncaring walking justice system dispensing justice (I mean death).These movies would be more appealing if they dealt more with the inner conflict a judge encounters, being also the jury and executioner.  This movie just has them not caring at all.Being a sci-fi and horror flick aficionado I certainly can understand the need for violence in some cases for theatric emphasis.  But this movie is the definition of mostly pointless and gratuitous violence that really does not attach well to the story.  If you are going to that, add humor like the Arnold movies.

1483504,A20DRRKAN5Z9Q,B005LAII80,Moviedude,"[3, 4]","Full disclosure: I came at this film as a die-hard fan of the Stallone vehicle. Maligned as it is, it offered a very faithful interpretation of the Judge Dredd universe, megacities, cursed earth, and all. In fact it is my belief that Stallone's Judge Dredd would be remembered fondly to this day had it not totally screwed up Judge Dredd himself. Stallone's Dredd kisses girls, takes off his hat, and generally behaves nothing like his comic book namesake.So for many fans, the tension for Dredd was the same. Will Judge Dredd be right? I'm happy to report that yes, Dredd is spot on. Carl Urban scowls, grimaces, does absolutely nothing to be appealing, and doesn't even take off his face-obstructing helmet when he's been shot through with armor-piercing ammunition. In fact the only field judge in the film who DOES show her face is Judge Anderson because hey, it would be a crime to cover up Olivia Thirlby. Speaking of which, good news there! Thirlby's Anderson brings the beloved supporting character (and sometimes miniseries star) to life with spunk and verve, and is a more than competent foil to both Dredd and the lowlifes they must battle.As much as this film improves on its predecessor's depiction of Dredd, however, its depiction of Megacity 1 veers far further off. This megacity is a much more believable place, an endless smoggy sea of skyscrapers and gridlock that stretches on forever, studded by Megablocks; enormous arcologies packed with far more people than they should hold. It's a minimalist, realistic place that suggests Gotham City or Equilibrium, and frankly I didn't care for it at first blush. But it grew on me; this film had neither the money for a more fanciful Megacity 1, nor the inclination. This is a SERIOUS Dredd film, ripped more from the pages of the later comics than from the camp 70s material that spawned the Stallone picture.The grit carries over into all respects of the property. Dredd's armor and motorcycle are toned down and believably futuristic; the technology of the world is less ""world of tomorrow"" and more ""next decade,"" and the Peach Trees megablock in which the film takes place is no futuristic spire or industrial nightmare, but a bunkeresque mashup of prison and council-housing. The use of colors and lighting both inside and out to induce loneliness and claustrophobia is more than a little reminiscent of the unlicensed 2000 AD film Hardware, which will please most fans of 2000 AD or British sci fi in general. All of this urban wasteland is underscored by a throbbing, buzzing electronic soundtrack that pitches and falls as the film moves along, but never quite disappears.The plot is paper thin but totally workable. Dredd and Anderson learn of a drug operation stemming from a particularly lawless megablock and move in to establish law and order. They soon find themselves trapped with the building's blast doors on one side and the cutthroat Ma Ma clan on the other. The gang's eponymous crime lord is played by Lena Headey, who is more or less channeling Cersei Lannister on a lazy weekend for the role, with good success. What ensues is a solid movie's worth of crazy gun battles with horribly graphic results. In its violence this movie closes in more on its source material, capturing the crazy kind of world Dredd inhabits- life is cheap, death only closes a mall for a half hour, and the police are equally likely to ticket you, imprison you for life, or shoot you in the face.The bottom line is that while this film does not capture the Dredd universe as vividly as the Stallone movie, it still gets the gist and it makes far better use of the characters. Here we finally have Dredd as the force of nature he is meant to be- neither good nor evil, a faceless avatar of his world's authoritarian law, destroying all those who break it purely on principle. We empathize with Dredd and Anderson, not because they are virtuous, but because the enemies they slay in such huge numbers are so much WORSE. Acting as a prequel of sorts to the books, and working with very little money, this movie still succeeds and would be a great basis for sequels.

This movie was such a low budget that special effects were few and far between. Not good for a Scifi flick.

Krueger,"[1, 2]","Plenty of other reviewers have already said everything possible on what's right about this movie so I'll keep my comments brief.I really wanted to like the Stallone version, which was terrible, yet did have a lot of great things in it.  It was just ruined by Hollywood camp and overproduction.This version more than atones for the sins of its predecessor. Story mechanics were basic and uncomplicated, but well managed. Casting was spot-on. Special effects were excellent, with no indication of a smaller budget. In fact, in light of the excesses of Michael Bay or Roland Emmerich, the lack of gratuitous CG was refreshing and provided a greater sense of authenticity.The action and violence (which was plentiful and frequently gruesome) was also stylized and at times surprisingly elegant.The characters were treated with respect by the film, showing personality, integrity, and thoughtfulness. No cliches or cardboard cutouts here.In all, everything I could have hoped for in a Dredd movie. Yet another indicator of how independent studios are breathing new life into an industry that all too often gets it wrong.More like this one please!My only criticism has nothing to do with the movie and everything to do with the Amazon instant rental. First, I wanted to watch the movie in HD, which they charge extra for. Then, because I'm trying to watch it using my laptop (High End MacBook with very fast Fiber internet), HD isn't available, though it would be on an array of other lower-end devices (Kindle, XBox, etc.) This is annoying and difficult to understand. At times the streaming was laggy, and just plain locked up, causing me to have to restart my browser and resume, which screws up the whole experience. When I can rent the same movie from RedBox for a buck, and have a much higher quality experience, the convenience premium starts to get weak.

I have a few points.1) the 3D is indeed exceptional - the best i've seen to date2) i forgot stallone made a version of Dredd.  I never saw it because I always assumed it was awful based on the rest of his material at the time (although obviously not all his films are terrible).  I assume this production cannot help but be superior.3) I didn't like it.  I was bored.  I was disappointed Urban was masked through the whole movie, and the role hardly required any acting chops.  However, this is the kind of movie that might grow on me, in spite of all that.  Some I hate on first sight and I know I'll never like.  Some I've learned I may dislike initially and for various reasons they grow on me; it turns out to be my expectations or just my frame of mind, or my age.  The Matrix was like that.  Doom was like that - although I *did* like it initially largely because of Urban and The Rock - it's come to be a bit of a cult favorite of mine.  And I can see Dredd possibly following that path.I gave it two stars mainly for the great 3D.  If I re-watch it and grow to like it, I'll revise this review and my rating to reflect same.

It's just like a present day housing project in that there is a lot of violence, but there are some key differences.The biggest difference is that in this movie the racial roles are reversed. Real housing projects are almost all filled with black residents who kill one another frequently. In Dredd the initiators of the ultra violence are the whites and the black residents are just another set of victims. In the movie the police force seems to be all white except for the police chief who is a black woman.Of course in the real world we don't build multi storied housing projects anymore, much less these super sky scrapers. All the oppressed, poor and miserable tenants of the huge buildings are completely integrated. No one pays any attention to any one's race. Racial harmony has triumphed although no one notes it. It is just taken for granted that race doesn't matter. There are black criminals but more white criminals and everyone gets along with everyone else swimmingly.The message is - what? Are we supposed to admire the way we can dispose of crime and criminals if we just let the police do what ever they want? Are we supposed to take this as a cautionary tale about rising crime? Currently most violent crime in America is committed by blacks. Detroit today is if anything worse off than the mega-city depicted in this film.

Unlike most studio titles this was released with the 3D version and the 2D on the same disc.  This forces the disc to have more data then normal so the data that is there needs gets compressed to a higher degree. The compression leads to more digital artifacts then I am used to seeing on modern Blu-Ray discs. It is not a horrible looking transfer by any means but not as good as some.  It would be nice to see this title released with both versions dedicated to a disc of their own.The audio on the disc is pretty good.  I am used to some very impressive uncompressed audio tracks though and the mix on this one is better in some places then others. This is not the fault of the disc but is about the mix created by the filmmakers. As with the video these are kind of nit picky things but I am used to such amazing quality on most of my discs that it does not quite compare to those.The movie itself I enjoyed and is much better in my opinion then the Stallone one from the 90's.

This movie takes itself seriously and by all means it should. If you want to invest in a flick that will do your 3D tv justice or just add a solid entry into your blu-ray collection, Dredd delivers.

1483570,A1C7S2YC3UWPVZ,B005LAII80,Riboflavin,"[2, 3]","A day in the life of Judge Dredd. Imagine if Robocop had replaced John McClane in the first Die-Hard, that's the premise for Dredd. A drug lord and her gang of heavily armed thugs trap Dredd and his rookie partner in a building the size of a fortress. What I like about this movie is that Dredd is not some unstoppable killing machine. He has procedures and training to handle situations like this, and he systematically makes his way through all obstacles using his skill. He never does anything dumb, and the screenplay never has to bail him out of a dead-end situation. He's a guy doing his job from start to finish.The story fits the budget, and the budget is used well. The effects are good and there was never a moment where I saw bad computer effects that take you out of the film. Dredd never takes his helmet off, and the context of the story never makes you question why or even care. You don't get to know any of the characters, and that's fine. The movie is like the TV show COPS in that way. You're along for the ride, and it's a well paced, well directed, and well acted movie.Now, there were a couple small things I didn't like. The rookie, Anderson, is a young woman with psychic powers. The powers are used in smart ways throughout the film except for a a couple brief scenes inside a captured thug's head that steer toward rape. I didn't feel this was needed, and I felt it hurt the strength of the female character to see it, rather than keep it hidden and just have her reaction.Overall I really enjoyed the film. It fits in with other good action films of the dystopian future genre. I'd like to see the story continue in further films, and that's why I'm recommending that people buy the movie to support it. It didn't do well in theaters, but it can do well on video, and video sales can resurrect franchises. In the film Dredd mentions that the Judges can only respond to 6% of the crime in a city of 800 million in a single day, and the film is just one of those days.",5,Lean and Mean,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",2013,1993,"['day', 'life', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Imagine', 'Robocop', 'had', 'replaced', 'John', 'McClane', 'first', 'Die-Hard', 'premise', 'Dredd', 'drug', 'lord', 'gang', 'heavily', 'armed', 'thugs', 'trap', 'Dredd', 'rookie', 'partner', 'building', 'size', 'fortress', 'What', 'like', 'movie', 'Dredd', 'not', 'unstoppable', 'killing', 'machine', 'procedures', 'training', 'handle', 'situations', 'systematically', 'way', 'obstacles', 'using', 'skill', 'never', 'anything', 'dumb', 'screenplay', 'never', 'bail', 'dead-end', 'situation', 'guy', 'doing', 'job', 'start', 'finish.The', 'story', 'budget', 'budget', 'used', 'well', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'was', 'never', 'moment', 'where', 'saw', 'bad', 'computer', 'effects', 'take', 'film', 'Dredd', 'never', 'helmet', 'context', 'story', 'never', 'question', 'why', 'even', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'fine', 'movie', 'TV', 'show', 'COPS', 'way', ""'re"", 'ride', 'well', 'paced', 'well', 'directed', 'well', 'acted', 'movie.Now', 'were', 'couple', 'small', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'rookie', 'Anderson', 'young', 'woman', 'psychic', 'powers', 'powers', 'are', 'used', 'smart', 'ways', 'film', 'couple', 'brief', 'scenes', 'captured', 'thug', 'head', 'rape', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'was', 'needed', 'felt', 'hurt', 'strength', 'female', 'character', 'see', 'rather', 'keep', 'hidden', 'just', 'have', 'reaction.Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'other', 'good', 'action', 'films', 'dystopian', 'future', 'genre', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'story', 'continue', 'further', 'films', 'why', ""'m"", 'recommending', 'people', 'buy', 'movie', 'support', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'well', 'theaters', 'can', 'do', 'well', 'video', 'video', 'sales', 'can', 'resurrect', 'franchises', 'film', 'Dredd', 'mentions', 'Judges', 'can', 'only', 'respond', '6', '%', 'crime', 'city', '800', 'million', 'single', 'day', 'film', 'just', 'one', 'days']",N/A

1483582,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,B005LAII80,Robert Badgley,"[1, 2]","Dredd(released Sept/12)stars Karl Urban as Judge Dredd,Olivia Thirlby as Anderson,and others.Those of you who saw the original with Mr.Stallone in the lead,will find this one a bit more to the point and closer to the comic book series.It is far darker than Stallone's version and far more violent.The director had a thing for slo-mo here and seemed to enjoy showing bullets rip through flesh,blood spurting everywhere and bodies hitting pavement,in that mode.It is certainly not for the squeamish and it seemed like he was making a gory point once but continuing to beat your heads with it all through the movie.I like both versions as they are like brothers with the same parents,but I think Stallone's comes in respectively ahead of this one.The story finds the post apocalyptic world now living in mega cities.Giant 200 or more storied apartment complexes are THE preferred places to live.The world also has a new style police force in which judges roam the streets and dispense justice,on the spot.Dredd is the most well known and storied of all the judges,and he has to accompany a rookie judge about the city and mark her as to whether she is future judge material or not.She scored four points below a pass at the academy,but her enhanced psychic abilities seem to make her an asset to the force.They attend a call to a 200 story high living complex which is controlled by a drug dealer by the nickname MaMa.She was a former model until a pimp she worked for wrecked her face and she went into illegal business for herself.She controls the entire building and it contains a home making drug lab which dispenses the newest in drugs,the latest being a substance,when inhaled,seems to slow down time to a micro-second when inhaled(everytime there is even the slightest hint of this drug being used,the director will use the slo-mo to ""enhance"" the feeling).Dredd and Anderson come upon a grisly scene in the atrium area where three flesh stripped bodies have been thrown down and lay on display for all to see.A local fills them in on what is going down and they head to an upper floor where they arrest one of the men responsible for taking the skin off the dead men.They attempt to leave but MaMa and her minions seal the building in,using old blast shields and doors.Now Dredd and Anderson have a prisoner with no where to go.For the next few hours the pair have some up and down encounters with MaMa and her troops,just barely escaping death.Eventually more judges show up outside and get in.Instead of assisting Dredd they are there to assist MaMa who has them on their payroll.Now Dredd and Anderson are forced to battle,not only MaMa's crowd,but dirty cops also.Little by little the dirty cops are taken care of and MaMa's time gets shorter and shorter.Eventually Dredd confronts her on her top floor.However,she has a remote control device that is rigged to go off if her heart stops beating.This doesn't stop Dredd who first wounds her,sentences her,gives her some of her own drugs and finally sends her crashing through glass and down onto the atrium floor like the others.The remote device goes off but the signal is too weak to set off 50 stories worth of explosive charges.In the end Anderson passes her grade test.Dredd is played by one of my favourite actors,who was first introduced to me via the TV show Xena.You may recall Karl wonderfully playing Caesar,with a bit of a bent to that charcater.He has since then appeared in a myriad of films,like one of the Riddick's,Doom,just to mention two off the top.Karl is a great actor with a great future ahead of him.Here he plays the comic book Dredd to a tee,ruthless with no remorse.I did find his emoting struck me a little funny,as he seemed to be channeling Clint Eastwood at times,doing a decent Dirty Harry impression.Other than that Karl was THE main character here,and when he wasn't around,the action I found lagged a bit.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include about six featurettes,a comic book prequel and commentary.All in all a not too bad remake of the original starring Mr.Stallone.The producers I'm sure would say it's not a remake but a companion piece to Stallone's,but a rose by any other name,as Shakespeare would say.Urban does a pretty good Clint Eastwood impression with what little lines he is given to say throughout,but he turns out to be the centrepiece of the film.If the director had not made so much use of slo-mo,which got too gory and tiring,I might have given this film more marks.Recommended.3 1/2-4 stars.",3,Much truer to the comics.,1358812800,"01 22, 2013",2013,4564,"['Dredd', 'released', 'Sept/12', 'Karl', 'Urban',

It's a silly movie, but if you took it seriously, you were kind of missing the point. It's meant to be over the top, and it succeeds gloriously. Because of this, I was maybe a little more way of the 2012 reboot than I needed to be, especially when the glowing reviews started pouring in. So it took me perhaps longer to get round to watching it than it should have. Ultimately, you can count me up as yet another convert to the cause; while the film is not without its (minor) problems, Karl Urban filled those shoes far better than I ever thought he would, and the breathtaking cinematography from Alex Dod Mantle (who also worked with writer Alex Garland on the similarly-gorgeous 28 Days Later...) pushes it over the top from acceptable to incredible.The plot: MegaCity has itself a new drug called SloMo, which does, well, about what you would expect. Right about the time you're asking yourself why this might be a bad thing, one of the drug's dealers injects someone with it, then pushes him off a 53rd-floor (was it 53rd? I think so) balcony. That drop is, well, ten times longer when you think the world is moving ten times slower. Enter MegaCity's police force. Judge Dredd (Doom's Karl Urban, who's come a long way, baby) has just been assigned a green recruit named Anderson (The Darkest Hour's Olivia Thirlby) to evaluate. Not the best idea when you're on your way to Peach Trees, MegaCity's equivalent of Cabrini Green in the early eighties, in order to take down Ma-Ma (The Purge's Lena Headey) and her gang of merry dealers. Though they don't know that yet at the beginning of the film&#8212;they only know Peach Trees is the place it's all coming from, and that they're going to stop it&#8212;unless Ma-Ma and her trigger-happy gang get there first.You probably found yourself thinking of a dozen different movies while reading that ridiculous attempt at a synopsis. I know I did while writing it&#8212;Training Day, The Raid: Redemption, The Horde, Red Road, and of course the 1995 Sylvester Stallone movie are all obvious points of comparison, and you're sure to find a lot of others. And yet Dredd manages, somehow, to reference all these things, often blatantly, without ever feeling derivative. That's huge, and I think a lot of it is down to screenwriter Alex Garland (28 Days Later...) . While the films based on his novels (which are similarly excellent) tend to be woeful, his original screenplays, well, I have yet to see one that wasn't cracking, and Dredd is no exception to the rule. Director Pete Travis (Endgame) gives Garland's script a grimy feel that really works here, and the principals all bring their A games (in some cases, I didn't even know these folks had A games to bring). As far as I'm concerned, Dredd ends up being the most pleasant surprise of 2012: an action movie that fires on every level. *** ",4,Draining Day.,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2014,3023,"['Dredd', 'Pete', 'Travis', '2012', 'am', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'actually', 'entirely', 'non-ironic', 'way', 'Danny', 'Cannon', 'cheesy', '1995', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'title', 'role', 'silly', 'movie', 'took', 'seriously', 'were', 'kind', 'missing', 'point', 'meant', 'be', 'top', 'gloriously', 'was', 'maybe', 'little', 'more', 'way', '2012', 'reboot', 'needed', 'be', 'especially', 'when', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'started', 'pouring', 'took', 'perhaps', 'longer', 'get', 'round', 'watching', 'should', 'have', 'Ultimately', 'can', 'count', 'up', 'as', 'yet', 'convert', 'cause', 'film', 'not', 'minor', 'problems', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'filled', 'shoes', 'far', 'better', 'ever', 'thought', 'would', 'breathtaking', 'cinematography', 'Alex', 'Dod', 'Mantle', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'writer', 'Alex', 'Garland', 'similarly-gorgeous', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'top', 'acceptable', 'incredible.The', 'plot', 'MegaCity', 'new', 'drug', 'called', 'SloMo', 'well', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'Right', 'time', ""'re"", 'asking', 'why', 'might', 'be', 'bad', 'thing', 'one', 'drug', 'dealers', 'someone', 'then', 'off', '53rd-floor', 'was', '53rd', 'think', 'so', 'balcony', 'drop', 'well', 'times', 'longer', 'when', 'think', 'world', 'moving', 'ten', 'times', 'slower', 'Enter', 'MegaCity', 'police', 'force', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'Doom', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'who', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'baby', 'just', 'been', 'assigned', 'green', 'recruit', 'named', 'Anderson', 'Darkest', 'Hour', 'Olivia', 'Thirlby', 'evaluate', 'Not', 'best', 'idea', 'when', ""'re"", 'way', 'Peach', 'Trees', 'MegaCity', 'equivalent', 'Cabrini', 'Green', 'early', 'eighties', 'order', 'take', 'down', 'Ma-Ma', 'Purge', 'Lena', 'Headey', 'gang', 'merry', 'dealers', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'beginning', 'film', '8212', 'only', 'know', 'Peach', 'Trees', 'place', 'coming', ""'re"", 'going', 'stop', '8212', 'Ma-Ma', 'trigger-happy', 'gang', 'get', 'there', 'first.You', 'probably', 'found', 'thinking', 'dozen', 'different', 'movies', 'reading', 'ridiculous', 'attempt', 'synopsis', 'know', 'did', 'writing', '8212', 'Training', 'Day', 'Raid', 'Redemption', 'Horde', 'Red', 'Road', 'course', '1995', 'Sylvester', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'are', 'obvious', 'points', 'comparison', ""'re"", 'sure', 'find', 'lot', 'others', 'yet', 'Dredd', 'manages', 'somehow', 'reference', 'things', 'often', 'blatantly', 'ever', 'feeling', 'derivative', 'huge', 'think', 'lot', 'down', 'screenwriter', 'Alex', 'Garland', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'films', 'based', 'novels', 'are', 'similarly', 'excellent', 'tend', 'be', 'woeful', 'original', 'screenplays', 'well', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'cracking', 'Dredd', 'exception', 'rule', 'Director', 'Pete', 'Travis', 'Endgame', 'Garland', 'script', 'grimy', 'feel', 'really', 'here', 'principals', 'bring', 'games', 'cases', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'folks', 'had', 'games', 'bring', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'Dredd', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'pleasant', 'surprise', '2012', 'action', 'movie', 'level', '***']",N/A

Some of us pay attention by god! Then I saw that it was offered in 3D, which just seemed like tying a pretty red bow around a pile of steaming...well, you get the idea.But then I saw that it was getting good reviews and I was all like...HUH?. This was, needless to say, a wee bit intriguing, as well as humbling, because my trailer analysis formula is rarely wrong. But i never got to the theater...I missed it.But, I saw it on Amazon and was elated! I punched in my pin code and let the sci-fi ultra violence flow from the screen and into my brain.

I felt like I was watching a gritty Judge Dredd comic come to life. The sets are limited, but that's because the film makers decided to be smart about the obviously modest budget they had to work with.

1483622,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B005LAII80,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[3, 4]","Ever noticed that in the movies the future is never a place you want to be. Like a tidal wave or an out of control fire in a disaster flick, the future is just another form of a big bad movie monster. Mega-city One of the new movie Dredd is no exception. A bleak future for sure, where 800 million people live in an enclosed society which stretches from Boston to D.C., where crime runs rampant, there are twelve major crimes committed per minute. Inside the Peach Tree block, which is where the majority of the action takes place, there is an unemployment rate of 96%, I'm not sure if that includes the drug dealers and slum lords or not.When I first heard of the updated Judge Dredd I mockingly joked that the tagline should read ""do you Dredd it"", I wasn't expecting much after the terrible Sylvester Stallone failed blockbuster of the 1990's, but I couldn't have been more erroneous in my assumption. Dredd turns out to be one of the most exhilarating comic book adventures in a while, it is also a puff of welcome retro rehashed air that is pretty enthralling to take in.Taking a more scaled back, realistic and understated approach than the nineties movie did, this is like a good looking 80's action-sci-fi throwback that captures the spirit of that era batter than some other recent films. It's stark, dark and engulfing in it's slant. In many ways it is the opposite of the earlier screen incarnation.In this gritty and grimy future world the Judges are the only thing standing in the way of anarchy, they are cops, but they also act as the whole juridical system including jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the biggest bad ass of them all, sent on a routine call he and his rookie partner (Olivia Thirlby) find themselves cornered off and trapped inside the Peach Tree block, which is run by the ruthless drug manufacturer Ma-Ma (Lena Heady) and her clan. Her new drug of choice, slo-mo, allows it's uses to experience the world at one percent of it's normal speed, so it's like the reversal of crack. She means business when it comes to not allowing the Judges to escape with their suspect, a gang member (Wood Harris) who can blow the lid off of her whole organization.The plot is nicely uncomplicated, in this day and age when action films so often allow themselves to get bogged down in overtly complex scenarios. The minimalist approach isn't just limited to the storytelling, but also the visual effects, which are lightly peppered through out, stylish but never over dominating with a refreshing lack of cartoonish CGI. The production design is properly atmospheric, unlike it's blotted predecessor. The violence, while bloody and graphic, is  often limited to short sudden and thrilling outbursts.Played out as sort of a cross between ""Dirty"" Harry and Robocop is Dredd himself, now portrayed by Karl Urban, who is a much more ideal choice for this material than was Sly Stallone two decades ago. Urban plays the role with a deep serious growl to match his menacing scowl, a low toned voice to equal that of Clint Eastwood. I am not familiar with the comic book 2000AD, which is Dredd's source of origin, but I understand that it has it's serious devotees who were appalled by the earlier version, among the truer to it's source is the fact that Urban keeps his helmet on through out the entire picture creating a rewarding mystique about him.. As Cassandra Anderson, Olivia Thirlby is the emotional center to the film, a newbie who may not be cut out for the kind of fascist justice she is required to deal out. Originating from the same slums she's targeting she has a more conflicted view than does Dredd. She is also a mutant, not with three breasts or anything, but she is psychic so she knows one's guilt or innocence, as well as their true motivations. Thirlby is very impressive here, she all but owns the movie, with dirty blonde hair and deeply expressive eyes, I'm glad  she's not kept behind a helmet the whole time, she's also more fun to look at than Urban.Also quite admirable is Lena Headey, Sarah Connor from TV's incarnation of the Terminator franchise and the movie 300, she is a force to be reckoned with as the film's main villain. A woman who's as strong as any of the men in the picture and as scary as any villain this year.The story and it's approach recall the best work of John Carpenter, as does Paul Leonard-Morgan's excellent mood setting techno score which helps set the pace the way Carpenter was known to do with music in the past. Likewise, the taunt ninety-five minute run time and keen editing by Mark Eckersley, who was responsible for the little seen gem of tension  the Disappearance of Alice Creed, keeps the proceedings crisp and thrilling.Regrettably the unnecessary 3-D effects hamper the truly exceptional roaming cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle, an Oscar winner for Slumdog Millionaire. I found the 3-D to be typically murky, the movie has a pale color scheme that does not lend itself well to the extra dimension,  and about half way in I just took the glasses off as it was giving me a migraine, fortunately my headache elevated and I was able to appreciate the excellent photography as it was. I don't think that this will be a problem on the DVD and Blu-ray releases, which is where I figure most people are likely to see this, for anyone seeing it in a cinema, I would suggest going the 2-D route.All coming together under an intense script from Alex Garland, who made this into a life fulfilling passion project. Garland allegedly clashed with director Pete Travis over the finished film, coming in behind him and finishing the venture himself. I only know one other movie by Travis, the undistinguished Vantage Point, but some of his other work has been better received. No matter, the behind the scenes tensions do not come across on the screen as things could not have looked better.Narrativley this is somewhat like the critically embraced Indonesian movie the Raid: Redemption, from earlier this year. This hard R-rated action movie left me felling fully pumped by the time of it's conclusion. Being released the last day of Summer, I'll be damned, but this may well be the kick a** movie of the year.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",4,still am the law,1362441600,"03 5,

It is much brighter and appealing than the trailer. Also, the story differs from the original's. The setting is similar, a crime-infested megalopolis isolated from a radioactive wasteland, and Judge Dredd is similar, though his uniform and bike are dingy compared to the original's gold and chrome. But the new movie offers a good deal more that is new, including an element of science-fiction ESP.JUDGE DREDD's plot progressed with a background of political corruption. DREDD's action occurs mostly in one of the megalopolis's skyscrapers, reminiscent of something from Peter F. Hamilton. Maybe that indicates that some science fiction screenwriters are beginning to do their homework by indulging in SERIOUS science fiction, which you can do only by reading. Anyway, it allows for an element of suspense when the hero and heroine become trapped in one of those gigantic buildings.The three main characters are done very well. It was good to see Lena Headey. She was fine as the heroine in the TV series TERMINATOR - THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES, and as a villainess in DREDD, she is superb. Though I won't say that the new actor for Dredd was better than Mr. Stallone, he was perfectly adequate (Karl Urban, familiar as Dr. McCoy in the new STAR TREK movies).

1483632,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B005LAII80,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","Spoilers in this review:Liked:(1) Good acting.(2) Mentor/protege relationship between Dredd and Anderson.(3) Production design was believable as a dark, slumlike dwelling.Disliked:(1) Excessive blood splatter in slow motion.  If you like films where characters are shot in the face and stomach in slow motion, and murder victims shown with bits of brain and gore everywhere, this film shows that.(2) Film is a 24 hour day in the work life of Dredd - we learn nothing about Dredd other than he is competent at his job, which we learn in the first few minutes of meeting him.  He hints that the job is difficult (in meeting with his boss), but the story itself never shows him having difficulty with it.  No character arc, no reason for audience to attach to him, audience can respect him for doing his job conscientiously, but except for the fact that he is determined to do his job as well as he can, which we learn in his first confrontation with the first junkies, Dredd's work throughout the story is a variation on his insistence of high quality law enforcement, but we don't see his effort (probably in part because the mask covers his face).  Even getting shot he uses to teach his rookie how to apply a basic field dressing.  A character outstanding at his job isn't enough for an audience to attach to him; the audience needs more information, but the filmmakers basically had him saying he is the law, and apparently felt that was enough.  That may be enough for fanboys, but for audiences unfamiliar with the character, there was insufficient information to understand Dredd.  For example, why was he so dedicated?  I needed to know more about him as a character to better sympathize with him.(3) Anderson is introduced as a psychic, yet she fails to anticipate being kidnapped, being shot, and also that Dredd would accept her as a Judge.  If the storytellers wanted her to be seen as partially psychic, they should have mentioned the limits of her powers before those limits were shown in the story.  Should we trust her word as truth or shouldn't we - she is used inconsistently.(4) Poorly realized master villan.  Ma Ma was given as the top villan in the story, yet we are first introduced to her as she is getting high.  It's hard to believe that a junkie could successfully run a drug empire because a junkie is not in control of herself while she is high, therefore during those times, her lieutenants and/or her competitors could easily kill her and steal her business from her.  Also, she makes the mistake of killing other junkies in the beginning of the story, and displaying their bodies in such a way that causes their deaths to be reported to the authorities, thereby bringing the Judges to the building; a very bad decision.  Yes she has corrupt Judges on her payroll (and who knows how far up the corruption goes in this story), but why bring unnecessary attention to her empire - very poor judgement for a master villan.  In addition, after she made the call to kill the junkies, and the Judges come and capture her second lieutenant, and he, by cunning, manages to escape, and capture a Judge in training at the same time, Ma Ma slaps and berates him and tells him the whole debacle is his fault, when in fact, it is her fault, and based entirely on her own decisions.  In other words, Ma Ma is a chief villan in name only, and nowhere in the story does she demonstrate competent, not to mention  exceptional, villan skills.  In a story where it is an automatic death sentence to attempt to kill a Judge, it's not bright for a character to place a hit on Judges with thousands of people as witnesses to it, over a loudspeaker.  A more effective strategy would have been to kill her second lieutenant before he left the building.  Doing that would have avoided having a direct confrontation with Dredd, and would have solved Ma Ma's problem of stopping her lieutenant from spilling his guts under interrogation, which was her principle goal.  It does not help a story to have a stupid top villan, it doesn't make the hero seem more heroic, it just makes the story seem dumb.  Also, it doesn't help a story to introduce a character representing them as top villan, and the story giving no example of them being top anything.  For example, Anderson was introduced as a psychic - though her psychic abilities were not on display throughout the story, there were some points in the story where they were demonstrated, so the audience saw that she was introduced as a psychic, and the story shows her to be a psychic.  In the case of Ma Ma, Ma Ma is introduced as the top villan, but the story itself provides no opportunities to display her superior villan skills.  Ma Ma was cruel and sadistic, but many film criminals are cruel and sadistic, it takes more than that to be a believable and competent master film criminal.  In a world where the State has technical and warfare superiority, intelligence is a minimum requirement for a believable film villan.  Villany, in my opinion, is hi-risk and hi-stress, it seems a very difficult career choice, and dumb villans would find themselves post haste imprisoned or worse.  In Dredd, Ma Ma should have been presented at the top of her game.  Then more tension could have been added to the story by having the audience worry if Dredd and Anderson would make it out alive.  The way Ma Ma is written, she poses no threat to Dredd in my opinion, and it is no surprise that he and Anderson not only escape, but complete their job of taking out her gang.(5) Music.  Just didn't like it as it was mostly used to punch up the violence, which I didn't like either.(6) Not believable that paramedic would have refused to allow Judges to shelter at the Medic Center.  Police officers, firefighters, paramedics, all first responders, in my opinion, share a camraderie (sp?).  I found it totally unbelievable that the onsite paramedic would not have allowed the Judges to enter the Medic Center once the Judges were under attack - 100% unbelievable.(7) Anderson's capture - I thought Dredd had the shot and could have stunned Anderson and her kidnapper.  Ma Ma's lieutenant, Kay (I think was his name), had his arms around Anderson and the gun, but from what I saw the gun was not pointed at Anderson, and I thought Dredd had a shot, and could have stunned them.  This is a film of course, and it's easy to armchair quarterback, and thank god I've never been in a gun battle, but I looked at the film many, many, many times and I thought Dredd could have stunned Kay and Anderson and thereby prevented her kidnapping.(8) World in which Dredd takes place is said to be future America, where nearly a billion people are squeezed into about 1/4 of the present country.  No information given as to how a billion people are fed and watered, if the rest of the country is a wasteland. Where does their energy come from? Their clothes?  Nobody looked as though they were starving - a poor beggar asks for drugs, not for food.(9) Disliked that Ma Ma was thrown out of a window by a man twice her weight to her death.  The storytellers protected this part of the story, showing why they had Dredd throw her from the window - but I am a woman, and I took absolutely no pleasure in seeing a man throw a woman by her neck out of a window.  Tinge of mysogeny (sp?) there from the storytellers, in my opinion, mostly shown by how much the filmmakers protected that image in the story.  To that same point, hated the mental rape scene Kay subjected Anderson to.  She was a police officer, disgusting that she was shown being raped.  Is this what the filmmakers think their male target audience wants, hyper violence and rape?(10) Black people in the drug business.  I am African-American and am so tired of seeing African-Americans as top people in the drug trade.  Here's my opinion, though I cannot prove it - despite the tens of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars our country spends on drug prevention, drugs are apparently as easy to obtain in most large American cities as milk at the local grocery store (no direct experience, opinion based on what I read).  If that is the case, there is corruption somewhere in our system.  I am sorry to report, as a middle age African American woman, I have yet to see in my own personal life powerful African American men - there is the president, but I do not know him.  To get drugs into this country, despite the laws and deterrents, someone is being paid and someone is granting access, people with power.  There are no doubt lots of independent operators, but in reading the newspaper/articles over the years, drugs are so prevalent that major drug routes must be open into the country for the drugs to flow apparently so freely, and drugs like meth and pot (sometimes planted in national parks), are homegrown, which I read about in newspapers when police make large busts.  And yet in drug themed film stories, you see African American men wheeling and dealing, but the men with power in this country are Caucasian, and you don't see representations in large enough amounts of those men at the highest levels in drug themed films.  I do not say that some African American men are not involved in the drug trade; I only say that they are, in my opinion, minor players - though minor players are bad too.  Nor do I mean to imply that a majority of American Caucasian men are involved in the illegal drug trade, that would obviously be untrue, as most Americans of all ethnicities are hardworking and law abiding.  I do believe though that despite advances in the country for minorities and women, the real power brokers in this country are still primarily men, Caucasian men.  Nothing against Caucasian men, who I count among my ancestors, as well as Africans, but apparently some have so much power that even film stories don't show the dirty deeds of some of the law breakers who happen to be Caucasian, in the proportion to which I suspect they play a part.  I'm not racist or sexist against Caucasian men (my ancestors after all, in part, make me who I am), but I do believe that power in this country, real power, belongs, still, predominantly to Caucasian men, though admittedly not the average working class or middle class person.  I'm not speaking of ordinary people when I talk of drug lords, and I don't know enough about drug lords to recognize one if I saw him or her, because, in my opinion, if they are successful in an illegal business, they would by necessity keep their business on the down low, as out of sight as possible.  So you see how unbelievable Ma Ma's appears in comparison, when she orders the Judges murdered over a loud speaker in the slum building where she lives.  That would be much too blatant for a successful drug lord, even one with Judges in their pocket.  How interesting it would have been then if the film had showed how far up the corruption in the Judge's Department went, how much more interesting to show a character with real power, more likely to be Caucasian and male, instead of the dumb villans shown in this cartoon.  The story would have been alot more believable and frightening.  As the filmmakers decided on a female villan, she needed to be smart and successful in her business, and that intelligence and success needed to be the story displayed for the audience; it's not something to be told the audience as the paramedic fills the Judges in about drug violence in the complex, but it needed to be part of the story, as much as Dredd taking out bad guys was the story.  Ma Ma ended up killing thousands of innocent citizens living in the building in her attempt to kill the Judges.  That was villanous behavior, but it occurred out of her interaction with the Judges.  Before that mass murder, the story needed to establish Ma Ma as brilliant, cool under fire, ruthless and utterly egotistical businesswoman, at the top of her game.  She was ruthless and egotistical, but unintelligent - no match for Dredd.  But this was a mistake by the writer, for she needed to be so villanous that the audience would wonder how Dredd could take her out.  The Judges are trained in urban warfare; Ma Ma, despite the violence surrounding her, ran a business.  Fighting Dredd was not playing to her strengths (of which I saw none), she is a capitalist who uses violence to maintain her business - her business is not the art of war.  Her men, though willing to do her bidding, are untrained and obviously unprepared to fight against a seasoned Judge and his rookie.  Nor did Ma Ma have a strategic mind.  It is the villan who sets the bar in a film story; the tougher and more dangerous the villan, the greater the hero's success is celebrated by the audience if the hero succeeds.  Remember the jubilation felt when Luke destroyed the death star in Star Wars IV - the audience was so pleased because the empire pushed all the right buttons as a villan; they were successful, better armed, ruthless, utterly selfish, Vader was nearly psychic with his use of the force.  The villan needs to be seen by the audience as a force to be reckoned with, for the audience to celebrate the hero's success we need an impressive villan.  A drug addict is not an impressive villan.  The villan needs to be bad to the bone, not afraid, as Ma Ma looked after she saw Dredd had survived her most determined assault.  The audience needs to be alittle afraid of the villan; the villany so excessive that even the audience, safe in their seats or on their couch at home, can't think how the hero is going to escape the threat the villan represents.  A well written villan is essential for the audience's enjoyment in a hero/villan story - a strong hero alone is insufficient to make a film story work properly, the villan is, in my opinion, even more necessary for the audience.  Part of the villan's job is to help the audience invest emotionally in the story, by hoping the hero is able to stop the villan's handiwork, whose work needs to be portrayed as anti-social as possible.  But it's not just the quantity of people she murders, she must be intelligent and behave in a way that represents a threat to the audience.  A dumb villan is not a threat, and so does not do her job in Dredd, not because of the actress, but because of how her character was written, what she was given to do, how and why she is destructive.  For example, again in Star Wars, the empire destroyed Princess Leia's home planet, just to gain street crede; in other words to prove to their competitors that they would kill billions of forms of life to get their way.  As the audience itself lives on a planet, the empire's action and why they acted, showed the audience that the empire was indeed a threat, and needed to be taken out.  When Luke managed to do so, the audience celebrates with him.  Another example of a great film villan is in Jaws; how dull that film would've been without the scary, aggressive, shark.  In Dredd, there is no believable villan, no shark.  Hard then to worry for the safety of Dredd and Anderson, who are trained warriors.  Even Anderson, who doesn't meet the standards of a Judge (the film shows that is because she is a defensive thinker, instead of an offensive one), manages to escape from Ma Ma's gang.  Also, Dredd wasn't structured properly, and so when Ma Ma was killed, though she clearly earned her death by her behavior, I was distanced enough from the film emotionally that I disliked how Dredd flung her out of the plate glass window.  What that means, is that the filmmakers were unable to properly attach me emotionally to their story for the reasons I've mentioned.(11) Secondary criminals - none of the secondary criminals, from the first junkies Dredd takes out, to the first gang members that answer Ma Ma's call to action, behave as if they exist in a world of Judges.  In Dredd, Judges exercise immediate life and death sentences, and yet the characters don't act accordingly.  For instance, how much more believable if the story had had one of the first junkies surrender to Dredd when he is offered life.  As an audience member, it seems to me I reacted more believably to the reality of the Judge's power than the characters did as I verbally admonished them on what to or not to do, none of the advice the criminals took (I guess they didn't hear me).  It makes a story more believable when characters act like they are in the same reality together - after all the audience assumes the characters want to live, though the characters gave no evidence of desiring that.  The story is not believable when the characters do not act as if they want to live.(12) Kay didn't know Judge's gun worked for individual Judge only.  Unbelievable that Kay wouldn't have known this.  He himself says he's known many Judges; corrupt Judges are on Ma Ma's payroll, no reason they wouldn't share this information. In his experience as a criminal in Dredd, Kay would know that a Judge's weapon was useful only to the Judge.  Totally unbelievable Kay would know not to use Anderson's gun.  And of course, not believable that Kay is alone when he attempts to kill Anderson.  Surrounded by gang members, why would he be alone in a room with her?(13) No eye candy.  Production design is bleak as the building is a slum.  Pretty protege for the guys, but no eye candy for women.  Unpleasant to be stuck in a slum with gangs and shoot 'em ups, blood and gore for most the entire story.  I understand Dredd doesn't take off his helmet but then no male beauty for women to look at, just a chin which is not enough.  No male beauty, no nature beauty, a real slogg visually unless you enjoy seeing how many ways characters can be killed.  Not fun.(14) Seemed almost a police officer propaganda film, showed hero police officers in a very flattering light - very careful to show Dredd firing only when he was fired upon and that he immediately lowered his weapon when criminals lowered theirs.  Showed honest officers as highly competent, professional and just about everything a future like that shown in Dredd would want officers with power of immediate life and death to be.  Romanticized policing, e.g., pretty girl calling Dredd sir, tons of war toys to play with. Propaganda, but hey we need good officers, and if this might attract young people, I'm not mad at the filmmakers for propaganda.  Obviously untrue of real policing, very romanticized, but I liked seeing a police officer provide the appropriate force necessary for a specific scenario.(15) Convenient that the skateboard deck located just so, when the Judge's were under the most intense attack; otherwise they would have tumbled who knows how many floors to their deaths.  If the skateboard deck was going to save Judges, needed it louder in the story, needed Judge's to know it's there, and not just have it there by luck.There are probably more story weak spots I cannot remember.  Basically, having no knowledge of Dredd, I approached the story on it's own merit (having read positive reviews), and found it to be pedestrian and not as well told as I'd like.  Hopefully they will try again and do better.  I give the movie 3 stars because the actors are competent and production design made me believe it was a slum, and also a star for effort for the film makers.  As I said, it would have been a much stronger story if the main villan had been better written.  The actress did what she could with it, giving her character a creepy, depressed feel, but her part needed to be much more intelligently written and she needed to be much more frightening.  All the criminals needed to be smarter, or at minimum, behave as if they existed in the same world as the Judges.",3,"didn't like it, but overall didn't hate it - think fanboys will enjoy it

good guys go into a large story, tenement building to get to the bad guy(s) at the top, and have to fight their way through throngs of heavily armed henchmen sent by said bad guy(s) to kill them, and all manner of kayos ensues (heck, the baddies from both War Zone and Dredd have bad facial scars that help to define who they are and why they're doing some of the bad stuff that they're doing).As for the, Dark Knight reference, it's in regards to the fact that the futuristic cities in both, look more like the downtown of most major metropolitan city, just with a few taller CGI created buildings seen in the distance (another thing the Stallone movie got right, as the comics show Mega City 1, as this multi-teared, Vegas like basterdization, with massive buildings, atop massive buildings, atop massive buildings all decked out in glass, neon and grime).Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie per say, it's just that it's not the definitive Judge Dredd movie that the critics were touting it as being, feeling more like a very small scale indie film that was given a bigger budget after the fact, meaning that the script is pretty basic, the effects are added in, after the fact embellishments (that look cool for the most part, but aren't necessary to the story, what little story we get).Karl Urban is a good actor, but was (in my opinion) miscast in this role (Jason Statham might have been a better choice or even, The Rock could have given the character the iconic profile that is Dredd) and the film plays more like you're watching a HD video game with a basic story plot to move along the action and carnage, but little in the way of character depth or real character development to be found.",2,HAVEN'T WE SEEN THIS BEFORE...???,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2939,"['What', 'do', 'get', 'combined', 'movies', 'Raid', 'Redemption', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'get', 'DREDD', 'Okay', 'so', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Dredd', 'comics', '2000AD', 'have', 'seen', 'lots', 'artwork', 'said', 'comics', 'know', 'Dredd', 'suppose', 'be', 'big', 'brutish', 'lug', 'guy', 'encased', 'suit', 'barely', 'one', 'things', 'got', 'right', 'Stallone', 'original', 'version', 'what', 'get', 'incarnation', 'Karl', 'Urban', 'Xena', 'Doom', 'Pathfinder', 'who', 'pretty', 'fit', 'guy', 'sickly', 'person', 'wearing', 'outfit', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'worn', 'guy', 'twice', 'size', 'thus', 'Raul', 'Julia', 'refference', 'WAS', 'sick', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'movie', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'looked', 'overtly', 'large', 'costume', 'threatening', 'consume', 'turn', 'not', 'mention', 'ill', 'fitting', 'iconic', 'helmet', 'fact', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Robocop', 'mouth', 'chin', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'out', 'as', 'good', 'helmet', 'making', 'look', 'too', 'small', 'thing', 'once', 'again', 'Stallone', 'looked', 'pretty', 'good', 'helmet', '.As', 'story', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Raid', 'Redemption', 'last', 'half', 'Punisher', 'War', 'Zone', 'then', ""'ve"", 'basically', 'seen', 'film', 'good', 'guys', 'go', 'large', 'story', 'tenement', 'building', 'get', 'bad', 'guy', 'top', 'have', 'fight', 'way', 'throngs', 'heavily', 'armed', 'henchmen', 'sent', 'said', 'bad', 'guy', 'kill', 'manner', 'kayos', 'ensues', 'heck', 'baddies', 'War', 'Zone', 'Dredd', 'have', 'bad', 'facial', 'scars', 'help', 'define', 'who', 'are', 'why', ""'re"", 'doing', 'bad', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'doing', '.As', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'reference', 'regards', 'fact', 'futuristic', 'cities', 'look', 'more', 'downtown', 'most', 'major', 'metropolitan', 'city', 'just', 'few', 'taller', 'CGI', 'created', 'buildings', 'seen', 'distance', 'thing', 'Stallone', 'movie', 'got', 'right', 'comics', 'show', 'Mega', 'City', '1', 'multi-teared', 'Vegas', 'basterdization', 'massive', 'buildings', 'atop', 'massive', 'buildings', 'atop', 'massive', 'buildings', 'decked', 'out', 'glass', 'neon', 'grime', '.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'say', 'just', 'not', 'definitive', 'Judge', 'Dredd', 'movie', 'critics', 'were', 'touting', 'being', 'feeling', 'more', 'very', 'small', 'scale', 'indie', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'bigger', 'budget', 'fact', 'meaning', 'script', 'pretty', 'basic', 'effects', 'are', 'added', 'fact', 'embellishments', 'look', 'cool', 'most', 'part', 'are', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'story', 'what', 'little', 'story', 'get', '.Karl', 'Urban', 'good', 'actor', 'was', 'opinion', 'miscast', 'role', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'even', 'Rock', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'character', 'iconic', 'profile', 'Dredd', 'film', 'more', ""'re"", 'watching', 'HD', 'video', 'game', 'basic', 'story', 'plot', 'move', 'action', 'carnage', 'little', 'way', 'character', 'depth', 'real', 'character', 'development', 'be', 'found']",N/A

Law enforcement officers are called Judges as they act as judge, jury and executioner. Society is attempting to regain law and order, but is losing. Drugs compromise the largest aspect of law enforcement. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) whose face we never see, is cold, calculating, and strictly by the book enforcer. He is assigned a rookie (Olivia Thirlby) who is a mutant and has special mind reading powers.When a triple homicide happens at a block high rise, our duo goes to investigate only to uncover a large scale drug operation. The drug is called ""slo-mo"" and gives one a slow motion sensation which adds to the special effects as we get to see plenty of slow motion killings.At this point the feature becomes akin to a video game where our two judges must ascend a a locked down high rise clearing out levels in order to reach Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) the leader.There is plenty of action.

On its east coast, from Boston to Washington D.C., lies Mega City One, a vast metropolis of 800 million people where criminals rule the chaotic streets.  The only force of order lies with the leather-clad urban cops called ""Judges"" who possess the combined powers of judge, jury, and instant executioner.  Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd (Karl Urban) is the ultimate Judge, challenged with ridding the city of its latest scourge, a dangerous drug called ""Slo-Mo"" and the sadistic crime boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is using it to take over the city.Based on a British comic book, ""Dredd"" is far better than the awful 1995 fiasco ""Judge Dredd,"" starring Sylvester Stallone.

There are other rating places more fitting for that like IMDB though i will say how i feel about the movie later.Of the features, the disk only lists it as 3d. The disk has both the 3d and the 2d versions which is nice. I love to get 3d but hate to watch it with the glasses on every time i want to see it. I was hesitant on buying this but there is a 2d version so have no fear.The 3d in the movie itself wasn't the greatest. My son wasn't sure if it was even 3d at first, though it was. There were no big points where anything jumped out at you. It seemed just to be a 'basic' 3d i guess i would call it. I have seen others use a scale, which measures how far things seem to leap out of the screen. This had depth, not nothing that wowed me. Still it was nice to have some dimension to what we saw and i liked it more than a 2d version.The movie comes with Ultra-Violet which tends to get a bad rap. I have the Flixster app on my ipad so i can stream the movie from anywhere and not use up space which i love. It goes without saying you can stream it from any other internet device like a pc. I personally like it because you can't lose the copy and it's always available. You can even download the movie straight from Flixster onto your device, just like an iTunes copy. The quality of the movie streamed is great and appears to be HD, not SD.It also comes with an iTunes copy is HD also. I bought Avengers and iTunes gave me the SD definition which i wasn't too happy with. This copy looks great, though i will probably never use it as it takes up a lot of space. Its still nice to have. I have to note that the iTunes version also has the special features included in the download.The bonus features are sorely lacking. There are only five features, and each only run for about two minutes. They don't get into much of anything. Because there was so little, i was disappointed, though i usually don't watch special features.A DVD copy would have been nice, but wasn't given. I probably wouldn't use it but maybe lend it out. I think this is why they didn't offer it. It's not a deal breaker.The insert in it is just a leaflet with the code for the digital copy and a cover for the movie. There's no pamphlets or any extras. There is a case cover that's nice.Personally i liked the movie, but not as much as the 90's carnation and i didn't like the color scheme on this one so much. Overall it was a good flick though. Urban did a good job, but was too robotic in his movements, like Robocop. He was trying too hard to be tough, unlike Stallone who was full of energy. It had lots of action and was fairly engrossing throughout. The story was good, and any fan of the old movie or the comics will most likely like it.For the price, its a good set.",4,Nice movie combo,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2827,"['review', 'score', 'based', 'set', 'what', 'get', 'not', 'movie', 'are', 'other', 'rating', 'places', 'more', 'fitting', 'like', 'IMDB', 'i', 'will', 'say', 'how', 'i', 'feel', 'movie', 'features', 'disk', 'only', '3d', 'disk', '3d', '2d', 'versions', 'nice', 'love', 'get', '3d', 'hate', 'watch', 'glasses', 'time', 'i', 'want', 'see', 'was', 'hesitant', 'buying', '2d', 'version', 'so', 'have', 'fear.The', '3d', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'greatest', 'son', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'even', '3d', 'first', 'was', 'were', 'big', 'points', 'where', 'anything', 'jumped', 'out', 'seemed', 'just', 'be', ""'basic"", '3d', 'i', 'guess', 'i', 'would', 'call', 'have', 'seen', 'others', 'use', 'scale', 'how', 'far', 'things', 'seem', 'leap', 'screen', 'had', 'depth', 'not', 'nothing', 'wowed', 'Still', 'was', 'nice', 'have', 'dimension', 'what', 'saw', 'i', 'liked', 'more', '2d', 'version.The', 'movie', 'Ultra-Violet', 'get', 'bad', 'rap', 'have', 'Flixster', 'app', 'ipad', 'i', 'can', 'stream', 'movie', 'anywhere', 'not', 'use', 'up', 'space', 'love', 'saying', 'can', 'stream', 'other', 'internet', 'device', 'pc', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lose', 'copy', 'always', 'available', 'can', 'even', 'download', 'movie', 'straight', 'Flixster', 'device', 'just', 'iTunes', 'copy', 'quality', 'movie', 'streamed', 'great', 'be', 'HD', 'not', 'SD.It', 'also', 'iTunes', 'copy', 'HD', 'also', 'bought', 'Avengers', 'iTunes', 'gave', 'SD', 'definition', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'happy', 'copy', 'great', 'i', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'use', 'up', 'lot', 'space', 'still', 'nice', 'have', 'have', 'note', 'iTunes', 'version', 'also', 'special', 'features', 'included', 'download.The', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'sorely', 'lacking', 'are', 'only', 'five', 'features', 'only', 'run', 'about', 'two', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'anything', 'was', 'so', 'little', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'i', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'special', 'features.A', 'DVD', 'copy', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'use', 'maybe', 'lend', 'out', 'think', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'offer', 'not', 'deal', 'breaker.The', 'insert', 'just', 'leaflet', 'code', 'digital', 'copy', 'cover', 'movie', 'pamphlets', 'extras', 'case', 'cover', 'nice.Personally', 'i', 'liked', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'much', '90', 'carnation', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'color', 'scheme', 'one', 'so', 'much', 'Overall', 'was', 'good', 'flick', 'Urban', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'was', 'too', 'robotic', 'movements', 'Robocop', 'was', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'tough', 'Stallone', 'who', 'was', 'full', 'energy', 'had', 'lots', 'action', 'was', 'fairly', 'engrossing', 'story', 'was', 'good', 'fan', 'old', 'movie', 'comics', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'it.For', 'price', 'good', 'set']",N/A

I can say that I enoyed this version for the most part.  The film only gives us a brief view of the city before the action starts.  Otherwise most of the film takes place inside a drab high rise.  I had to see the film in 3D due to limited screenings for the 2D.  I'm not a fan of 3D or an expert but I thought the 3D FX were not that impressive.  There was plenty of beautiful slow-mo and close up head shots though.Karl does a good job as Dredd playing a man of action but few words.  The film is dark, bloody, beautiful and yes even a little poetic.  I hear that comic book fans were glad that Dredd keeps his helmut on for the whole film.  I for one had a hard time finding a emotional connection with his character.  You never see his eyes so I had a feeling of disconnect.  So Dredd remains a mystery at least to me but then maybe that's the whole point.
