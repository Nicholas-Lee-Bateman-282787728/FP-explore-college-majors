I grew up a fan of the Runaways, and this ""backstage pass"" is a fascinating trip in all aspects of its artistry.  For those of us over 40, it's also a very fond skip down memory lane: these girls were pioneers in the truest sense of the word.In the mid 70s, I was roughly the same age at the time The Runaways debuted, and I identified with them in ways that were more a part of my imagination than how it really was.  I could never have imagined the abuses they endured just to get on stage.  After watching this video, I'm awe-struck that both Joan and Lita had the fortitude to carry on with their respective careers after such a swindled start.  Also, as a Joan Jett fan myself today still, I wanted to add that after watching the film closely I think it's pretty obvious why she didn't want to participate, and I don't think it has anything to do with it ""not being enough about her.""  There's an aspect, albeit fascinating for us outside of the music business, about this documentary that is gossipy, sad, and back biting.  She lived it and overcame it.

855307,ABMEK1TDJFB5U,B00061QJ58,C. Incognito,"[12, 21]","First off, let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of documentaries and rock and roll documentaries in particular. When I first heard about the Runaways documentary, I was very excited to say the least. The story is there and though I'm not the world's biggest Runaways fan, I was very intrigued with seeing this film. Their tale is one that is way beyond average in terms of music and the music business and perhaps someday someone will give it the treatment it deserves.Here's what I felt was wrong with the film. It seems as though the lack of any overwhelming library of Runaways footage has been a huge hurtle for filmmaker Vicky Blue to try and successfully jump. The thing that is so grossly annoying about this film is that there seems to be about 10 or 15 minutes worth of Runaways footage that is put into slow motion and played seemingly over and over and over again throughout the film. I'm not saying that there isn't any good footage of the Runaways in the film because there is a little. It's just mind-numbingly annoying to be watching some heartfelt interview with any one of the interviewees cut away to some slow motion footage of Lita Ford playing guitar and then several minutes later, getting into another interview and having another cutaway to the SAME slow motion footage of Lita Ford. It just got so tedious to watch that keeping any sort of interest in the subjects and the subject matter was futile. The whole thing just could have been SOOO much better. Why not just keep your camera on the interviewee until they've finished answering the question that was set to them instead of making us endure some sort of mindless black and white footage of  Sandy West under a bridge or in a warehouse or wherever the hell they shot it  that you keep cutting away to again and again and again? It's just too damn arty for it's own good.I know I'm not going to deter any hardcore Runaway fans from seeing the film and I suppose if you must, you must. Just don't expect to see Joan Jett being interviewed which is ofcourse a glaring ommission which, from what I gather, was purely Joan's own choice. It's just another reason why this film is so flawed which, understandably, is no fault of the filmmaker. What is the fault of the filmmaker is that she didn't have enough faith in Runaways fans to believe that they'd sit through a film about the Runaways without (not so) slick film tricks and gimmicks that make such things as VH1's Behind The Music such an annoying affair. All that really had to be done was tell the story and that would have sufficed nicely. I'm very dissapointed.",1,Unsatisfying,1122854400,"08 1, 2005",2005,2610,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'documentaries', 'rock', 'roll', 'documentaries', 'particular', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Runaways', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'say', 'least', 'story', 'there', ""'m"", 'not', 'world', 'biggest', 'Runaways', 'fan', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'seeing', 'film', 'tale', 'one', 'way', 'average', 'terms', 'music', 'music', 'business', 'perhaps', 'someday', 'someone', 'will', 'give', 'treatment', 'what', 'felt', 'was', 'wrong', 'film', 'lack', 'overwhelming', 'library', 'Runaways', 'footage', 'been', 'huge', 'hurtle', 'filmmaker', 'Vicky', 'Blue', 'try', 'successfully', 'jump', 'thing', 'so', 'grossly', 'annoying', 'film', 'be', 'about', '10', '15', 'minutes', 'Runaways', 'footage', 'put', 'slow', 'motion', 'played', 'seemingly', 'over', 'again', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'good', 'footage', 'Runaways', 'film', 'little', 'just', 'mind-numbingly', 'annoying', 'be', 'watching', 'heartfelt', 'interview', 'one', 'interviewees', 'cut', 'away', 'slow', 'motion', 'footage', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'playing', 'guitar', 'then', 'several', 'minutes', 'later', 'getting', 'interview', 'having', 'cutaway', 'SAME', 'slow', 'motion', 'footage', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'just', 'got', 'so', 'tedious', 'watch', 'keeping', 'sort', 'interest', 'subjects', 'subject', 'matter', 'was', 'futile', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'SOOO', 'much', 'better', 'Why', 'not', 'just', 'keep', 'camera', 'interviewee', ""'ve"", 'finished', 'answering', 'question', 'was', 'set', 'instead', 'making', 'endure', 'sort', 'mindless', 'black', 'white', 'footage', 'Sandy', 'West', 'bridge', 'warehouse', 'wherever', 'hell', 'shot', 'keep', 'cutting', 'away', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'just', 'too', 'damn', 'arty', 'own', 'good.I', 'know', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'deter', 'hardcore', 'Runaway', 'fans', 'seeing', 'film', 'suppose', 'must', 'must', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'being', 'interviewed', 'ofcourse', 'glaring', 'ommission', 'what', 'gather', 'was', 'purely', 'Joan', 'own', 'choice', 'just', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'so', 'flawed', 'understandably', 'fault', 'filmmaker', 'What', 'fault', 'filmmaker', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'faith', 'Runaways', 'fans', 'believe', ""'d"", 'sit', 'film', 'Runaways', 'not', 'so', 'slick', 'film', 'tricks', 'gimmicks', 'make', 'such', 'things', 'VH1', 'Music', 'annoying', 'affair', 'really', 'had', 'be', 'done', 'was', 'tell', 'story', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'nicely', ""'m"", 'very', 'dissapointed']",Edgeplay - A Film About The Runaways
855308,A2I18AO597DSDI,B00061QJ58,"David Pearlman ""sound fanatic""","[13, 15]","First things first: This is neither quite the brilliant documentary that some have suggested, nor is it a failure, as others have stated. The greatest strength of this documentary is honesty. Four of the five members of the most famous version of the group (excluding Joan Jett) provide extensive on-camera interviews, as does replacement bassist Vicki Blue (also the director), and they are mostly no holds barred. Instigator/original manager Kim Fowley also appears for guarded but unvarnished commentary. The original Runaways are all interviewed separately, and each provides her reminiscences. It is quite clear from the interviews that all the the original members look back at both the other members and the overall experience with a mixture of ambivalence, bitterness, and regret. Taken as a whole, their reminiscences provide a Roshoman-like perspective from which a net truth can be pieced. This is as close to that truth as we have gotten, and much closer than we get in the more recent bigger budget Runaways movie.To anyone interested in the Runaways story, or interested in the sordid machinations behind the Svengali fueled star-making machinery of the music business, this will be engrossing and will be essential viewing.That said, it has to be noted that while Tishler-Blue has made an interesting documentary, it isn't a GREAT documentary, owing partially to limitations on archival source material available to her, owing part to the lack of participation by Joan Jett, and owing in part a somewhat too narrow, too inside approach to the story.OK, let's take those three points one at a time:1) Limitations on the archival source material. Joan Jett declined to participate. As a result, vintage Runaways songs co-written by Jett were not available either for the soundtrack, or for video. Therefore, for example, footage of the Runaways performing is limited to two cover songs. The soundtrack is populated mostly by Lita Ford solo songs and Suzi Quatro songs. The lack of performance footage and music isn't the only problem, however. More significant in the absence of vintage footage of the Runaways at press conferences, in TV interviews, behinds-the-scenes, etc. This footage exists, and it is not clear why none was used. The contrast between the middle aged women the Runaways have become and these women as teenagers would have added tremendously to the film.2) Joan Jett's lack of participation. As noted, this resulted in the lack of vintage performance materials. But it also means we are not treated to Jett's perspective on the days of the Runaways. Surprisingly, this is a relatively modest loss. The interviews with the other former members are (seemingly) honest enough that they paint a pretty complete picture. Jett's thoughts would certainly have added even more color to the picture, but one doesn't actually sense that her lack of interview participation leaves as large a hole as might be expected.3) A too narrow, too inside approach. The film takes as almost a given that the viewer is invested in the Runaways as cultural icons, and that there is little need to investigate their place in the development of pop music. While that's OK for diehards, it unnecessarily limits the appeal of this film. I think it also does a disservice to The Runaways, as there is nothing here to support the assertion that The Runaways were of lasting cultural significance. While good arguments can be made for that premise, none are provided. And while nothing kills a music related documentary as quickly as modern pop icons offering retrospective ""scholarship"" (see any VH1/MTV production), where is the essential commentary contemporaries of The Runaways--from artists with whom they toured or co-mingled, such as The Ramones, Cheap Trick, Blondie, etc? Where is the back story on the girls, which might explain how 14 year old girls were hanging out at nightclubs by themselves, were available to be exploited in the first place, and might help explain how each of them ultimately dealt with how things turned out? How about some more outside voices to help define Kim Fowley, their infamous manager? The meat of this movie would always be the interviews with the women themselves, of course, but framing is critical to make something more universal.Despite these limitations, if you have an interest in The Runaways, the film still packs a punch.Compared to the slick, bigger budget Runaways docudrama (which was produced with Joan Jett's participation, and which reflects a mostly Jett-centric view, and an almost entirely Jett Currie focus), this is most certainly the deeper film.That said, the sad thing is that this documentary contains the outline of a GREAT docudrama: Young, naive girls with doe-eyed dreams taken in by a predatory Svengali, used, abused and discarded, with the most fulfilling part of the story how they ultimately dealt with the collapse of those early promises. There's plenty of sex, drugs, and rock and roll to spice it all up, of course. But I think that's the far less interesting story. Too bad that's the story that, for the most part, the big budget Runaways film chose to feature. Contrasting how the different members of the group dealt with the collapse of the Runaways offers a fantastic mix of success, failure, reinvention, the triumph of tenacity, and tragedy of being unable to reconcile childhood dreams with adult realities, specifically:Jackie Fox, the smartest one (and the one who would always have the most options available to her), drops out of the group first, goes off the grid, finds herself, goes back to college, Harvard law, and becomes a successful attorney.Vicki Blue, replacement bassist, leaves and becomes a successful video auteur.Joan Jett and Lita Ford: Prospects outside the music world might have been minimal, but they were driven and lucky, and ultimately found legitimate success in music on their own terms.Cheri Currie: Directionless but benign girl has her innocence and childhood evaporate as she becomes the sexed up jailbait singer for The Runaways. She buys into the image and lifestyle, but finally quits in disgust, eventually finding a certain peace in a modest (figuratively) just outside of Hollywood existence.Sandy West: Fox had the brains, Blue the artistic and personal perspective, Jett and Ford had the musical talent and drive and Currie was scrappy enough to find her way. West just wanted to play drums. When that went south, her life trajectory was one of deepening decent into darkness: drug dealing, jail, etc. Her interview for this film reveals that nearly a quarter of century later, she still wondered ""what happened?"" and was waiting for that Runaways reunion that would never come. (West died a couple of years after this film was completed).In an ideal world, I'd end here by stating that someday, someone will make the great Runaways movie just crying to be made. But realistically, we're not likely to see another shot at the story. Too bad.If you've seen The Runaways movie, and you're interested in further backstory, this documentary is a must. If you haven't seen either movie, and you know who the Runaways were, then I'd recommend this movie over The Runaways. If you're just looking for an hour and a half of entertainment, go with the The Runaways. But there's a lot more heart (and a lot more real sadness) in this film.",4,Antedote to glossy Runaways movie; Good job given director's constraints; incomplete but gives real insight into Runaways

Anyways when I 1st heard the music of the Runaways and when I listen to it today it screams out rebellion to me. I always thought the band was way too underrated and any time I mention them or their music no one has a clue of what I am talking about. Also ther is something major and important to this documentary but no matter how hard I try I just cant explain it. Every time I watch it it moves me and leaves such an impression on me that I feel for hours to come! I was born in 1980 a little late to have experienced this exciting time in music history a time when you had such great Rock bands and Disco wich I also love ,wow what a mix!!! But I have always loved the greats like Black Sabbath,Led Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Thin Lizzy,Kiss,Judas Priest,Hendrix, and so on and so on. They did such a phenomenal job of portraying the emotions the turmoil and excitement of what the girls of the Runaways may have felt and had to endure during this harsh and wild time in their lives. I can relate to them because I was out of the house almost permanently at the age of 14 myself and experienced the drugs,sex alcohol and wild wild nights for the next 5 years after that! And might I add I was ""uh hem"" never turned down by a woman in my teenage years lol, but music was always there for me it was my savior and a massive part of my life no matter what was going on or how bad and out of control things got. I can feel their pain and I can feel the loss that Sandy West describes at the end of the documentary just wishing they hadn't broken up. It is amazing and knee weakening to me to see some of their old footage of the 5 of them on stage rocking out just as hard as the great Rock n Roll bands of the 70's. Just the premise of 5 gorgeous women playing rock is amazing in itself and probably will not be redone successfully by any females for years to come. Their footage is dark and gritty and matches their music perfectly it is very raw and exhilarating. I am glad this movie was made before Sandy West passed away, so that we could see her points of view, and for me her speaking at the end is the most heart wrenching for me just wishing she could relive it once more knowing if their sleazy management wasn't involved and if they could have put their differences aside they could have done so much more and gone so much farther. I wish Joan Jett would have appeared so we could have got her point of view. As a child I remember falling in love with her from the moment I 1st saw her on MTV playing I love Rock n Roll. I know the movie of the runaways is debuting in theaters right now as I type this, but I feel it cannot match or be anywhere near as magnificent as the documentary. I don't feel that the actors like Dakota Fanning or Kristen Stewart know the magnitude of the Legends they are portraying, did they know anything about The Runaways prior to the premise of the film? A good thing I have seen is that the living Runaway members are coaching and helping the actors out, so there may be some hope after all. We will see how it turns out.

But I thought this was a documentary about a rock band. There are barely any scenes at all of The Runaways in concert -- and all three of those instances (and they ARE ""instances"") feature cover songs, not originals such as ""Cherry Bomb"", ""Blackmail"" or ""Thunder"".  The bulk of the film, however, is just endless anecdotes.  Yak, yak, yak, yak, yak.  Nearly two hours of redundant talking. Yes, the ladies are fascinating, but I could've learned all I needed to know in half-an-hour.Yes, I understand all about ""rights"" and ""clearances""; however, EVERYONE has a price, and the holders of the song copyrights would surely have allowed them to be used in the film (instead of Blue having to rely on the incongruency of Suzi Quatro songs on the soundtrack). This documentary was obviously Vicki Blue's labor of love, so she shouldn't've been watching her pennies so closely. It would've been worth spending a few thousand dollars just to get the rights to a half-dozen songs.  Why not?When I picked up the first Runaways album back in 1976, I bought it because I wanted to ROCK.  My intention was the same when I picked up Edgeplay.

855312,A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B00061QJ58,hyperbolium,"[8, 9]","The Runaways were both an actual all-girl rock `n' roll band and a realization of their impresario's promotional imagination. Their run of four studio albums in the 1970s (The Runaways,Queens of Noise,Waitin' for the Night,And Now... The Runaways), a live LP (Live in Japan), and a few odds `n' sods collection (Flaming Schoolgirls) yielded some terrific glitter-flavored rock, a great deal of publicity, but only a modicum of commercial success. Though they provided inspiration for bands like the Go-Go's, Pandoras, and Donnas, and two of the original members (Lita Ford and Joan Jett) went on to international acclaim, the group's original publicity still casts a shadow over the Runaways' musical accomplishment. They remain more infamous than famous.The band's second bassist, Vicki Blue, developed a post-Runaways career as a producer/director (under the name Victory Tischler Blue), and is the visionary behind this documentary. Blue's inside connections with the band is both a blessing and a curse, as the group members are candid with her on some subjects but appear to close down on others. She tells the interior story of the band's interpersonal dynamics, focusing on the shifting friendships and tensions between band members, and the abuse heaped upon the then-teenage girls by management and assorted hired hands. This is more a diary than a history.Even those familiar with the Runaways public career would have greatly benefited from an explanation of where these girls came from, a brief discourse on the culture of the Sunset Strip and San Fernando Valley, the musical times, and the family lives that allowed teenage girls to tour under the reportedly abusive and non-watchful eyes of Kim Fowley and manager Scott Anderson. Signature events, signings, and concerts are alluded to but never fully highlighted, and the band's peers and fans are omitted from the picture. The lack of context or third-party perspectives saps some of the power from the first-person interviews. The largest blow of all, however, is the lack of participation by Joan Jett, the band's heart and soul, and the inability of the filmmaker to license any of the Runaways studio recordings. Live performances of Lou Reed's ""Rock `n' Roll"" and the Troggs' ""Wild Thing"" give you a taste of their power as a band, but little sense of their original music.Blue's interviews with four of the original band members, Cherie Currie, Lita Ford, Jackie Fox and Sandy West, are supplemented by interviews with songwriter Kari Krome, impresario Kim Fowley, latter-day manager Toby Mamis, and inspiration Suzy Quatro. Blue is able to get some startling admissions from her former bandmates, particularly Cherie Currie, and their on-going damage is revealed in the bitterness they harbor and the anger that remains towards one another (they're each interviewed separately) and for the adults who abused them. Blue doesn't successfully confront Fowley on the group's allegations, but interviews with Currie and West's mothers go a long way to solidifying his dark reputation.Kim Fowley saw the band's demise as a product of the members' lack of friendship, but what's clear from the interviews is that neither Fowley nor Scott Anderson had an interest in the group's long term well-being, and used the teenage girls' immaturity as weapons against them. The band's demise, after a disastrous album with British producer John Alcock, produced a short-lived solo recording and film career for Cherie Currie, chart success as a pop-metal star for Lita Ford, and a major international music career for Joan Jett. Drummer Sandy West fell into a series of jobs outside the music industry (construction, bartending, veterinary assistance) and rackets (protection for drug dealers) before succumbing to cancer and a brain tumor in 2006. West remained haunted to the end by the Runaways' breakup, angry at those who manipulated the band and unable to understand why a reunion couldn't be pulled together.Blue's film editing is very busy. The dizzy, hand-held interview footage quickly turns from v&eacute;rit&eacute; to distraction, as does the constant presence of music beds, and the jump cuts and video effects. Her choice of sunny outdoor locations for many of the interviews prompts her subjects to wear sunglasses, hiding the expressiveness of their eyes. Blue is to be lauded for getting this film off the ground, dealing with numerous limitations, and sticking with it to completion. Her insider's perch informs but also colors the story she tells, and without the broader context of the band's life and times there remains a definitive biography to be made. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

My husband enjoyed it also, and he'd never heard of them (though of course he was a big Joan Jett & Lita Ford fan back in the day).  I'll never forget the first time I heard the band: I was sitting in my Mom's car listening to the radio while she was inside a pizza shop waiting on our order... the DJ said the next band was all-female, all teenaged girls... the song was ""Cherry Bomb"" and it was a revelation!  I must've been 12 or 13 at the time.  An all girl hard rock band -- imagine that!  But they disappeared almost as fast as they'd arrived on the scene, and I forgot about them until high school when Joan Jett & the Blackhearts entered my life and I learned she'd been a Runaway.  JJ definitely has a big part in the soundtrack to my teen years!  All these years later it's great to finally learn the whole story behind the seminal all-girl rock & roll band.  The only thing missing is Joan Jett and the music... I was really bummed that the band's music is mostly missing from this documentary.  For someone like my husband who'd never heard anything but ""Cherry Bomb"" while listening to the ""Dazed and Confused"" soundtrack, it was a real let-down.  Normally I'd say a documentary about a rock band with almost none of the band's music present would be a joke; however, this documentary transcends that.

I came to it by way of Joan Jett, whom I liked.  I wasn't crazy about the Runaways album.  This film, however, reveals a group of girls who were, in fact, quite talented and strong, and who became skilled and made some good music.Unlike other reviewers, I don't see Kim Fowley as quite the abusive sleazebag they did...More, he was a banal, self-important, smarmy, drover. Did he take advantage of them?  Perhaps.  They didn't seem to make any money to speak of during their 5 years together--there's no mention of what Fowley walked away with, either, though.  And if he used them, he also groomed them.  The girls were (understandably) unprepared for the hard realities of the music business.  And they didn't like it when Kim called them names.  Say whatever you want about Fowley, though, he took a bunch of inexperienced, horomonal, undisciplined kids who didn't know a whole lot of music, and he turned them into professionals. He made them rock stars; he gave them a shot at something great.  He just didn't seem to be very good at managing teenage girls--is anyone?  They were kids, and left to their owen devices, they drank; they took drugs--lots of them; they had sex--with each other, with one of their managers, with who-knows-who else.The film seems weirdly lopsided without a contribution from Joan Jett.  She went on in post-Runaways life to enjoy the greatest fame, and it is peculiar that all the other bandmates contributed to the movie, but she didn't.  This odd omission isn't even mentioned in the film, or in the extras.  Jett appears, of course, in the archive footage from the 70s, but that's it.Blue assembles footage and interviews that successfully evoke sympathy and even affection for these kids, and I would have liked to know more about what became of them after the Runaways broke up.  Blue, of course, is a filmmaker.  Jett is a muy butch rock star who likes to tease her fans about her sexual orientation.  Ford, too, went on to become a successful musician with some hits in the late 80s (no mention of this in the movie, though).  Sandy, the drummer, seems by the end of the movie bitter--she went on to become an arm-breaker and money collector for drug dealers, and to work ""in construction.""  That's all we really know about her Runaways afterlife.  What about Jackie Fox, the original bass player?  Despite having fled the band after trying to carve herself up with a piece of broken glass, she seems in the interview footage to be pretty together.  She is articulate, intelligent, clear.Devoting too much time to their post-band lives would have unfocused the film, but something could have been included that would both concluded the film and resonated with what preceded it.  Failing, that, something could have been included in the Extras.Also, did I miss something here?  Is there no actual recorded concert footage with music in this movie?Maybe I'm nitpicking.  I also realize that it probably isn't really a 5-star movie, for the reasons I've mentioned. Still, I enjoyed the film.  There was nothing about the film I didn't enjoy.  As another reviewer pointed out, this is clearly a labor of love, and therefore deserving of whatever generosit we can muster.

855317,A202FGBQHO5638,B00061QJ58,L. Alper,"[67, 73]","Victory Tischler-Blue's ""Edgeplay"" is a riveting, emotional, brutally honest film about what happens when a cruel, manipulative man pumps 6 teen girls full of dreams.The Runaways were a groundbreaking rock group whose influence over the years belies their mediocre record sales at the time. Somewhat manufactured in that none of the girls knew each other before being picked out by uber-scenester Kim Fowley, they still managed to forge a raw identity of their own while rebelling against his emotional abuse. Having been a 13 year old in Los Angeles at the time of their first album release, I can personally attest to the dreams they inspired amongst their fans.All the girls involved except Joan Jett co-operated fully in this documentary. The interviewer / director was one of The Runaways herself: Vicky Blue was the bass player who replaced Jackie Fox after Jackie left the band. Even Kari Chrome who never played onstage, but contributed songs to the first album & was instrumental in Kim's initial concept of the band is interviewed.Cherie Curry has previously written of her experiences in her autobiography ""Neon Angel"" but, judging from this documentary, left huge gaps in her book. All the dirt, all the hurt, all the damage done to fragile teen egos is finally aired in ""Edgeplay"". Cherie admits to sexual relationships both with other members of the band as well as a long-term one with ""hands on"" manager Scott Anderson which left her pregnant during their European tour. Her combustible relationship with Lita Ford (who spends most of her interviews either having to be reminded of recordings or glossing over her violent temper) led to Cherie's departure from the band.Jackie Fox (the first bass player) discusses the real reason she abruptly left The Runaways in Tokyo at the peak of their fame. The revelation leaves her in tears, and the scars from the experience remain on her body to this day.The most affecting interviewee is Sandy West, the drummer. As with most drummers, Sandy was never an intellectual or prone to analyzing situations. She just wanted to play drums & have a good time. Greedy, manipulative power plays took her life away from her & the final scene is of her tear-streaked face wondering why the original members can't reunite & record together again. It's a wrenching scene that illustrates vividly the damage done to these young girls.Ms. Tischler-Blue also interviews both Sandy & Cherie's mother's which provides an excellent background on how Kim Fowley was able to abuse these young women so freely. Kim himself spends his interview time blustering & dodging questions, never coming close to admitting the wreckage he made of these 7 lives.The extras aren't much, but do provide some additional background to ""Edgeplay"". There is a Video Gallery, which consists of some of the background footage used with more of Kim Fowley's bluster playing over it. The only other extras are 3 different promotional trailers. Interestingly, much of the promotional footage was not actually used in ""Edgeplay"". The final one, called ""Edge-Tap"" is hilarious, and a much needed antidote to the raw emotional footage of the film.Absolutely recommended to anyone who wants to see what really goes on in the rock world. With the current mania for tarting up young teen girls & displaying them as sexual objects on MTV, ""Edgeplay"" is amazingly relevant to today's music business.

Certainly the documentary would be better with Joan Jett's participation and more Runaways music in the soundtrack, but there is enough archival footage of the band on tour and in the studio to really intrigue and make this worth watching. Again it's worth mentioning that the other band members really lay it out there for all to witness.This is a real ""warts and all"" documentary with a lot of interpersonal conflict examined and it's why Jett declined to participate, from what I've read, and that's her prerogative. While there's only two songs of performance footage, it's killer and helps demonstrate how good this band really was.

855322,A1SKSWWQT1CFP7,B00061QJ58,"pattic ""pattic171""","[211, 225]","I don't even know where to start. I've watched Edgeplay three times in the few days since I got it, and still feel as if I am seeing new, dusty corners in a room I grew-up in.If you are looking for another typical, VH-1 styled look at the fun and excesses of a dysfunctional rock band, this complex film may disappoint you. Edgeplay is not a film intended to excite, gawk, or fawn over it's subjects, and I say subjects rather than ""subject"" intentionally, as it's a film about people, not about the rock 'n roll lifestyle. There is no whimsy for the joyful free-sex and drugs of the 70's, or any fanboy enthusiasm for The Runaways as a band.What there is, is an insightful and compassionate look at a tragic and yet stoic group of young women, who made history, without ever recieving any praise, who made great music without ever selling many records, and who paid dearly in many ways for their now legendary status, with a good part of their childhoods.Edgeplay is a documentary about the all-girl hard-rock band The Runaways, who so much like their tourmates The Ramones, set the next two decades on fire, without getting any of the credit or rewards.Victory Tischler-Blue, the director, writer and concience of  Edgeplay, endured a 6-year trial-by-fire getting this film made and released,(and is a story as compelling as any in her movie), and I think much of the raw honesty and poignance in this film is in some ways a direct result of that struggle.There is an almost Dickensian cast of characters: A young, Joan Jett-Talented and driven, yet shy and unsure of herself, Cherie Currie-A striking blonde, who never expected to be a singer, and yet, much like Lana Turner sitting at a soda fountain, was chosen to be one, Kim Fowley-A slimy Svengali who unashamedly preyed on very, young girls to make himself rich, and makes no apology, Sandy West-A tomboyish, young drummer who simply loved playing her drums, and wanted no more than to spend her life doing it, Jackie Fox-A doe-eyed bassist who found out earler than the others that stardom could be an empty trophy cup, Lita Ford-Fiesty, tough, and driven, and Vicky Blue-The bassist who walked into this dysfunctional family in the midst of meltdown, and yet stayed on the outside enough, and more importantly, grew-up enough to make this incredible film.I think Miss Blue, ex-band member and director of Edgeplay, knew something that Margaret Mitchell, author of Gone With The Wind knew. Mrs. Mitchell once said about the theme of her novel, "" I often wondered why some people could rise above great adversity, while others, just as brave and smart, go under. All I know is that my daddy called that quality ""gumption"". I wanted to write about people that had gumption, and those who didn't"". Well whether intentional or not (though I expect it was), that is exactly what Miss Tischler-blue has done here.As most will know, Lita Ford and Joan Jett managed to escape the musical ghetto that was The Runaways, to find great success in the music business. The original bassist is now a successful attorney. Cheri Currie, although never achieving the same level of success, managed to find work in Hollywood for many years, and has continued with a low-profile music and art career. Sandy West, however was plagued with misfortune after her band dissolved, falling into desperately hard times, both financially, and otherwise, and much of this is explored unflinchingly in Edgeplay.This film works on so many levels that I sometimes am awed by it. When you watch it the first time, you see and hear the story of a rock band. When you watch it a second time however, you begin to become absorbed by the enormous differences in these women. All but one of the members, now in middle-age and 25 years away from The Runaways, still carry deep emotional scars from their experiences, that seem to transcend anything that has happened to them since. All but one of them breaks down on camera in a way that's agonizing to watch. Is it really possible to carry resentment from teenaged slights and squabbles into middle age? Once the women start talking to Miss Blue's camera, you find out that you can indeed.The only one who does not seem affected by her experiences so long ago is Lita Ford, who I found, quite unexpectedly, the most fascinating of all. After 4 decades or so of life, I like to think I know false bravado when I see it, and yet in Lita I saw none. It's amazing to watch her face as she walks back over the same old paths as the others while recounting her experiences, and yet, to her, it was almost like describing a movie she had seen, and enjoyed, but could only partially remember; not because it wasn't exciting, but because, well....it was only a movie. Lita ends-up being Edgeplay's Scarlett O'Hara. The one who had gumption.Of course Joan Jett became a star as well, but we'll never know her thoughts and feelings on things, as she declined to participate in the film. As I understand it, she was violently opposed to the film, it apparently not focusing enough on her, and did everything in her power to crush the film before it could be released.  This is utterly mystifying, as her treatment in the film is not-at-all negative, and if anything, she comes across as rather inoffensive and hard-working. Very strange.Edgeplay is, in many ways, the ""Clockwork Orange"" of rock documentaries. From the dark, sadonic tales of excess and loss-of-innocence, to the startlingly effective and moody camerawork, (which usually annoys me, but here served a real dramatic purpose for a change), this is a film that anyone can get something out of, whether you're a Runaways fan or not.After posting a review of Edgeplay on another site, I was amazed and delighted to recive an email from the director of the film, thanking me for my good review, and expressing her relief that someone ""got"" what she was trying to achieve with Edgeplay. Yes Victory, because of your long journey in making this poignant, affirming, yet disturbing documentary, we all got more than we could have hoped for. Don't worry. You did good.",5,Amazing,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,6083,"['do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'where', 'start', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Edgeplay', 'three', 'times', 'few', 'days', 'got', 'still', 'feel',

Since the sixties we've seen a million of them: The Monkeys, Partridge Family, Menudo, n' Sync, etc.  The Runaways, however, are in a class by themselves because they were never popular enough to make any money.  Like any contrived ""band"" they were really just play acting.  They even admit to trying to pretend to be real rockers.  The mid-seventies was a real vacuum for rock and roll the result of which produced disco and a band like the Runaways.Here is the story in a nutshell:They were conceived in the mind of Kim Fowley as a manufactured noveltyThey all liked Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple.They all had cool hair.They all had personality issues and hated each other.They all had cool, tough clothes.They were all teenagers.We know they a ""tough"" chicks because they cuss and have tattoos and stuff.Wow the lead singer wears a corset on stage.The manager was a leach and abusive.Uh oh, then came the sex and the drugs - what a shock.I was friends with her, but she hated the other one, then she said something about me...blah, blah, blah...they all hated each other.They all had really cool costumes and stage personality.Their parents were ""stressed"" about their little girls being on the rock `n roll road - they had to grow up too fast.They all like to cuss, afterall, they are rock 'n roll.Jackie wanted to quit so she could wear high heals and grow her nails long.  Quitting was the toughest thing, stop the camera while I cry.The end was near --Vicki Blue looked too much like Lita.1976 debut - 1978 last release; a whirlwind career that featured not one memorable recording or show (I was in high school and saw them --once).OK enough clich&eacute;s bring on the music.  Only one problem with the Runaways, their music was unlistenable.  Don't believe me?  The filmmakers agree because with the exception of a couple of brief clips everything about them is profiled EXCEPT their music in this self-indulgent, silly, MTV Behind The Musicish mocumentary.  A ridiculous DVD profiling an absurd group of no talents.  What's next, a similarly ridiculous DVD documentary of The GO-GOs?  Please refrain!Bottom line: There is nothing redeeming abut this DVD.

855325,A1AHYCO2YWXXG5,B00061QJ58,"Privacy, Please","[2, 2]","I like the Runaways and admire the pioneering work they did.  They paved the way for generations of grrl bands and female rockers of all genres, including punk, glam and metal. Joan Jett and Lita Ford went on to become respected solo artists, while Cherie Currie made her mark most notably as an actress and Jackie Fox excelled in a non-musical career (law).  Unfortunately, during the Runaways' time together, they took a lot of guff at the time from both their male managers and from music industry types (and even some fans) who saw them as a cheesecake novelty act, rather than the serious and talented rockers they were.  This documentary, made by a former member of the band (Vicki Blue, who replaced Jackie Fox on bass), has a few holes but does the best job of bringing together perspectives of the band members (aside from Jett, who did not participate and instead focused on the ""Runaways"" fictionalized film project), original manager Kim Fowley (who looks, dresses and talks like Max Headroom of all people), and various parents and others involved with the band.Some of the notable holes in the documentary, besides the glaring absence of Jett and the equally glaring absence of Runaways music due to rights issues, include:- No mention of interim bass players Micki Steele (who later became famous as a member of the Bangles), Peggy Foster, or Laurie McAllister, aside from Lita's comment that the band went through a lot of bass players, which seems odd given that only two bass players (Jackie and Vicki) are mentioned in the film.- A fairly long interview with Kari Krome, who was responsible for getting Kim Fowley to start the band but ended up not being a member herself, that ends with Kari saying she wrote songs for the band (she is indeed listed on some songwriting credits for the albums) but leaves the viewer hanging as to what Kari's ongoing involvement was, especially since Lita brings her up at some point saying Kari was ""someone else's responsibility"".- No wrap-up as to what the individual members did after the band was over.  Runaways fans who have kept up with the members' activities probably already know, but viewers new to the band (including a great many who might have been tiny tots or not even born when the band was around) are more likely to only know Joan Jett and perhaps Lita Ford (if they are metal heads).  Some ""where are they now"" would have been a nice ending and also less of a downer than the impression given that post-band, everybody just sank into substance abuse and general malaise.I don't want to nit-pick though, as I think Vicki did a great job with the difficult hand she was dealt.  Speaking as a middle-aged person myself, it can be difficult to revisit the emotionally charged events of one's youth, especially when one has learned from mistakes and moved on to bigger and better things.  That angst is fully captured here, but all of the ladies come across as very admirable and also still very attractive.  They are all survivors.  I'm especially glad Vicki was able to extensively interview Sandy West before she passed away - may she RIP.",4,The best that could be done under the circumstances,1326240000,"01 11, 2012",2012,3111,"['like', 'Runaways', 'admire', 'pioneering', 'work', 'did', 'paved', 'way', 'generations', 'grrl', 'bands', 'female', 'rockers', 'genres', 'including', 'punk', 'glam', 'metal', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'went', 'become', 'respected', 'solo', 'artists', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'made', 'mark', 'most', 'notably', 'actress', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'excelled', 'non-musical', 'career', 'law', 'Unfortunately', 'Runaways', 'time', 'together', 'took', 'lot', 'guff', 'time', 'male', 'managers', 'music', 'industry', 'types', 'even', 'fans', 'who', 'saw', 'cheesecake', 'novelty', 'act', 'rather', 'serious', 'talented', 'rockers', 'were', 'documentary', 'made', 'former', 'member', 'band', 'Vicki', 'Blue', 'who', 'replaced', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'bass', 'few', 'holes', 'best', 'job', 'bringing', 'together', 'perspectives', 'band', 'members', 'aside', 'Jett', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'participate', 'instead', 'focused', 'Runaways', 'fictionalized', 'film', 'project', 'original', 'manager', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'who', 'dresses', 'talks', 'Max', 'Headroom', 'people', 'various', 'parents', 'others', 'involved', 'band.Some', 'notable', 'holes', 'documentary', 'glaring', 'absence', 'Jett', 'equally', 'glaring', 'absence', 'Runaways', 'music', 'due', 'rights', 'issues', 'include', 'mention', 'interim', 'bass', 'players', 'Micki', 'Steele', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'famous', 'member', 'Bangles', 'Peggy', 'Foster', 'Laurie', 'McAllister', 'aside', 'Lita', 'comment', 'band', 'went', 'lot', 'bass', 'players', 'odd', 'given', 'only', 'two', 'bass', 'players', 'Jackie', 'Vicki', 'are', 'mentioned', 'film.-', 'fairly', 'long', 'interview', 'Kari', 'Krome', 'who', 'was', 'responsible', 'getting', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'start', 'band', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'member', 'Kari', 'saying', 'wrote', 'songs', 'band', 'indeed', 'listed', 'songwriting', 'credits', 'albums', 'viewer', 'hanging', 'what', 'Kari', 'ongoing', 'involvement', 'was', 'especially', 'Lita', 'up', 'point', 'saying', 'Kari', 'was', 'someone', 'else', 'responsibility', '.-', 'wrap-up', 'what', 'individual', 'members', 'did', 'band', 'was', 'over', 'Runaways', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'members', 'activities', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'viewers', 'new', 'band', 'including', 'great', 'many', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'tiny', 'tots', 'not', 'even', 'born', 'when', 'band', 'was', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'only', 'know', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'perhaps', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'are', 'metal', 'heads', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'ending', 'also', 'less', 'downer', 'impression', 'given', 'post-band', 'everybody', 'just', 'sank', 'substance', 'abuse', 'general', 'malaise.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'nit-pick', 'though', 'think', 'Vicki', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'difficult', 'hand', 'was', 'dealt', 'Speaking', 'middle-aged', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'revisit', 'emotionally', 'charged', 'events', 'one', 'youth', 'especially', 'when', 'one', 'learned', 'mistakes', 'moved', 'bigger', 'better', 'things', 'angst', 'fully', 'captured', 'here', 'ladies', 'come', 'very', 'admirable', 'also', 'still', 'very', 'attractive', 'are', 'survivors', ""'m"", 'especially', 'glad', 'Vicki', 'was', 'able', 'extensively', 'interview', 'Sandy', 'West', 'passed', 'away', 'may', 'RIP']",Edgeplay - A Film About The Runaways

855328,A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,B00061QJ58,stoic,"[3, 3]","In the mid-1970s, Los Angeles musician Kim Fowley had the idea of forming a rock band made up of teenage girls. Fowley named the group The Runaways. For a time, The Runaways were quite successful, though internal squabbles caused the group to split after just four years. The band might be forgotten now, but Runaways Joan Jett, Lita Ford, and Cherie Currie all went on to bigger things after the band's run ended.In the early-2000s former Runaways bassists Jackie Fox and Victory Tischler-Blue decided to make a film about the band. Their film - Edgeplay - is a solid documentary. By all accounts, the group's time together was full of drama and there were many difficult times as they toured the world. Fowley conned the girls' parents into letting them go on the road, but did little to supervise the teens. Predictably, the Runaways' tours quickly degenerated into drugs, sex, and rock n' roll; several of the Runaways became romantically involved with each other, which heightened the tense, dramatic mood behind the scenes.The Runaways portray Fowley as a Svengali who subjected them to horrible abuse. Frustratingly, the film supplies few details of exactly what happened between the girls and the manager - though it drops plenty of hints. Fowley appears in the early stages of the documentary and supplies some interesting insights - for some reason, however, he does not appear much in the film's second half.The former Runaways make very different impressions on the viewer. Joan Jett does not appear at all and her absence is frustrating. On the other hand, Lita Ford often appears but has little coherent to say. Singer Cherie Currie enjoys recounting the tales her former bandmates' constant bed hopping, drug abuse, and fighting. Drummer Sandy West is the saddest of the former group members - she laments the group's breakup and recounts her hard-luck story of trying to make a living in the years since then.The film runs on a bit too long at almost two hours and there are some mother missed opportunities as well. For instance, with the exception of Sandy West, the film does not update the viewer on what happened to these women after the band broke up. Given that the Runaways are mainly famous for what happened after they disbanded, this is a major oversight.Nonetheless, for viewers seeking a couple of hours of drugs, sex, and rock n' roll, Edgeplay is a difficult documentary to top.",4,"Drugs, Sex, Rock n' Roll - A True Story from the 1970s",1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,2409,"['mid-1970s', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'musician', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'had', 'idea', 'forming', 'rock', 'band', 'made', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Fowley', 'named', 'group', 'Runaways', 'time', 'Runaways', 'were', 'quite', 'successful', 'internal', 'squabbles', 'caused', 'group', 'split', 'just', 'four', 'years', 'band', 'might', 'be', 'forgotten', 'now', 'Runaways', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'went', 'bigger', 'things', 'band', 'run', 'early-2000s', 'former', 'Runaways', 'bassists', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'Victory', 'Tischler-Blue', 'decided', 'make', 'film', 'band', 'film', 'Edgeplay', 'solid', 'documentary', 'accounts', 'group', 'time', 'together', 'was', 'full', 'drama', 'were', 'many', 'difficult', 'times', 'toured', 'world', 'Fowley', 'conned', 'girls', 'parents', 'letting', 'go', 'road', 'did', 'little', 'supervise', 'teens', 'Predictably', 'Runaways', 'tours', 'quickly', 'degenerated', 'drugs', 'sex', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'several', 'Runaways', 'became', 'romantically', 'involved', 'other', 'heightened', 'tense', 'dramatic', 'mood', 'scenes.The', 'Runaways', 'portray', 'Fowley', 'Svengali', 'who', 'subjected', 'horrible', 'abuse', 'Frustratingly', 'film', 'supplies', 'few', 'details', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'girls', 'manager', 'plenty', 'hints', 'Fowley', 'early', 'stages', 'documentary', 'supplies', 'interesting', 'insights', 'reason', 'however', 'not', 'appear', 'much', 'film', 'second', 'half.The', 'former', 'Runaways', 'make', 'very', 'different', 'impressions', 'viewer', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'not', 'appear', 'absence', 'frustrating', 'other', 'hand', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'often', 'little', 'coherent', 'say', 'Singer', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'recounting', 'tales', 'former', 'bandmates', 'constant', 'bed', 'hopping', 'drug', 'abuse', 'fighting', 'Drummer', 'Sandy', 'West', 'saddest', 'former', 'group', 'members', 'group', 'breakup', 'hard-luck', 'story', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'years', 'then.The', 'film', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'are', 'mother', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'well', 'instance', 'exception', 'Sandy', 'West', 'film', 'not', 'update', 'viewer', 'what', 'happened', 'women', 'band', 'broke', 'up', 'Given', 'Runaways', 'are', 'mainly', 'famous', 'what', 'happened', 'disbanded', 'major', 'oversight.Nonetheless', 'viewers', 'seeking', 'couple', 'hours', 'drugs', 'sex', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'Edgeplay', 'difficult', 'documentary', 'top']",Edgeplay - A Film About The Runaways

In many ways, this is just the same old story of a hungry bunch of young rock n' rollers who are taken to the cleaners by management (typical). However, the personal BS that went on with these girls was beyond crazy and very emotional for them to this day. Jett's absence from this project is classless on her part. But, I was really surprised at the nerve of the singer for blaming everyone else in the universe besides herself for both the band breakup (inevitable) and much of the crap that went on between band and management. She may have cleaned up nicely over time. But, she needs to grow up and lay claim to her cancerous role in this debacle of a band. My heart goes out to Sandy West as well. Her story reminds me that in life the word ""fair"" is a four letter word in more ways than one and second chances are a rarity for the truly deserving.",5,VERY REVEALING,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,1014,"['are', 'plenty', 'dirty', 'details', 'here', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'boy', 'band', 'lol', 'Hearing', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'Sandy', 'West', 'original', 'bass', 'player', 'was', 'great', 'many', 'ways', 'just', 'same', 'old', 'story', 'hungry', 'bunch', 'young', 'rock', 'n', 'rollers', 'who', 'are', 'taken', 'cleaners', 'management', 'typical', 'However', 'personal', 'BS', 'went', 'girls', 'was', 'crazy', 'very', 'emotional', 'day', 'Jett', 'absence', 'project', 'classless', 'part', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'nerve', 'singer', 'blaming', 'everyone', 'else', 'universe', 'besides', 'band', 'breakup', 'inevitable', 'much', 'crap', 'went', 'band', 'management', 'may', 'have', 'cleaned', 'up', 'nicely', 'time', 'grow', 'up', 'lay', 'claim', 'cancerous', 'role', 'debacle', 'band', 'heart', 'out', 'Sandy', 'West', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'life', 'word', 'fair', 'four', 'letter', 'word', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'second', 'chances', 'are', 'rarity', 'truly', 'deserving']",Edgeplay - A Film About The Runaways
