1333290,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B0038SUBGO,Amazon Customer,"[2, 3]","This movie is a documentary-like rip off of Murder by Numbers, its far higher quality and more enjoyable inspiration. 3 kids decide to methodically plan to murder another classmate, and the film is shot Blair Witch-style where they use their personal camcorder to interview each other and track their progress. While not offensively bad as some low budget horrors are, this film nonetheless fails. Where Murder by Numbers had 2 characters most interesting simply because you would not expect them to be killers, this film focuses on 3 absolute loser types. Particularly the female of the group - she's a jaded 18-20 y/o type who ""hasn't felt anything in a long time."" Rather than being interesting characters, they end up being infinitely annoying in their nihilistic views on life, and their need to constantly remind the camera of why they need to kill. Other than their annoyingness, the movie is painfully slow, a plot with no creative elements, and no intangible other elements that would otherwise save this waste of time.",1,the most boring social delinquents ever,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",2010,1028,"['movie', 'documentary-like', 'rip', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'far', 'higher', 'quality', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'inspiration', '3', 'kids', 'decide', 'methodically', 'plan', 'murder', 'classmate', 'film', 'shot', 'Blair', 'Witch-style', 'where', 'use', 'personal', 'camcorder', 'interview', 'other', 'track', 'progress', 'not', 'offensively', 'bad', 'low', 'budget', 'horrors', 'are', 'film', 'nonetheless', 'Where', 'Murder', 'Numbers', 'had', '2', 'characters', 'most', 'interesting', 'simply', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'killers', 'film', '3', 'absolute', 'loser', 'types', 'Particularly', 'female', 'group', 'jaded', '18-20', 'y/o', 'type', 'who', ""n't"", 'felt', 'anything', 'long', 'time', 'Rather', 'being', 'interesting', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'infinitely', 'annoying', 'nihilistic', 'views', 'life', 'need', 'constantly', 'remind', 'camera', 'why', 'need', 'kill', 'Other', 'annoyingness', 'movie', 'painfully', 'slow', 'plot', 'creative', 'elements', 'intangible', 'other', 'elements', 'would', 'otherwise', 'save', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

This movie affected me with disgust, nausea and a stomach distress, not just because the cameraman had no sense, but also because of the multiple failures of the directing, writing and acting.Meadowoods tries to do a faux-documentary style movie about three very boring and distorted college losers, with pedestrian, impromptu conversations about killing people.  The dialogue was as pitiful as the acting and the faux-documentary style fails.  The entire movie is a series of shallow, commonplace interviews with the drudging characters.  Every interview is essentially the same pathetic question being asked in a different way, with the same flat answer every time.I didn't even care about the irksome characters.  Seemingly some of the worst acting I have ever seen.  The acting was toilsome and the whole thing just passed so tediously on and on.Basically, if you're bored enough and enjoy psychological thrillers, just push your head into a pillow, it'll be more fun.",1,Leadowoods,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",2010,1069,"['Meadowoods', '2010', 'lack', 'confidence', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'affected', 'disgust', 'nausea', 'stomach', 'distress', 'not', 'just', 'cameraman', 'had', 'sense', 'also', 'multiple', 'failures', 'directing', 'writing', 'acting.Meadowoods', 'tries', 'do', 'faux-documentary', 'style', 'movie', 'three', 'very', 'boring', 'distorted', 'college', 'losers', 'pedestrian', 'impromptu', 'conversations', 'killing', 'people', 'dialogue', 'was', 'as', 'pitiful', 'acting', 'faux-documentary', 'style', 'fails', 'entire', 'movie', 'series', 'shallow', 'commonplace', 'interviews', 'drudging', 'characters', 'interview', 'essentially', 'same', 'pathetic', 'question', 'being', 'asked', 'different', 'way', 'same', 'flat', 'answer', 'time.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'irksome', 'characters', 'Seemingly', 'worst', 'acting', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'acting', 'was', 'toilsome', 'whole', 'thing', 'just', 'passed', 'so', 'tediously', 'on.Basically', ""'re"", 'bored', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'just', 'push', 'head', 'pillow', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'fun']",N/A
1333292,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B0038SUBGO,Compay,"[8, 9]","Even renting this movie from Netflix is a waste of your time. Meadowoods is not much better than your typical film school project. It's simply a dull film with a number of inconsistencies. The film is shot in the same style as Blair Witch Project, though with worse audio quality. One difference between Blair Witch and this film is that Meadowoods relies on a music score which is actually decent, but doesn't fit many scenes.The first 2/3 of the movie, you'll find yourself glancing at your watch as the film plods along. There's too much foreshadowing in the dialogue, all but giving you an idea of what the characters will do by the end. The trio of plotters also seem fairly anti-social, yet still manage to throw a party filled with cool college kids and hot women. They're unusually sadistic, and boredom is the only explanation of why they want to kill and torture someone.Even as the film reaches its conclusion and picks up the pace, it's not that scary. The screen goes pitch black for a while, and you can't get a sense of claustrophobia until the box is dimly lit for the last 10 minutes of the movie. Only one of the actors has any film experience, so don't expect strong performances. Ila Schactler does show some screen presence as the trio's victim Kayla, though. But while a decent musician, a guitar segment in the film seemed more like an unscripted afterthought that wasn't needed.Meadowoods has already received a five-star review by someone from Seattle. Oddly enough, that's where this movie was filmed. The only good thing about this movie is that it gave new actors some film experience. Otherwise I think it's boring, and wouldn't recommend renting it for a dollar through Redbox, let alone buying the DVD.",1,Boring & Predictable Psychological Horror Flick,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,1733,"['Even', 'renting', 'movie', 'Netflix', 'waste', 'time', 'Meadowoods', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'typical', 'film', 'school', 'project', 'simply', 'dull', 'film', 'number', 'inconsistencies', 'film', 'shot', 'same', 'style', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'worse', 'audio', 'quality', 'One', 'difference', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'film', 'Meadowoods', 'relies', 'music', 'score', 'actually', 'decent', ""n't"", 'fit', 'many', 'scenes.The', 'first', '2/3', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'find', 'glancing', 'watch', 'film', 'plods', 'along', 'too', 'much', 'foreshadowing', 'dialogue', 'giving', 'idea', 'what', 'characters', 'will', 'do', 'end', 'trio', 'plotters', 'also', 'seem', 'fairly', 'anti-social', 'yet', 'still', 'manage', 'throw', 'party', 'filled', 'cool', 'college', 'kids', 'hot', 'women', ""'re"", 'unusually', 'sadistic', 'boredom', 'only', 'explanation', 'why', 'want', 'kill', 'torture', 'someone.Even', 'film', 'conclusion', 'up', 'pace', 'not', 'scary', 'screen', 'pitch', 'black', 'while', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'sense', 'claustrophobia', 'box', 'dimly', 'lit', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Only', 'one', 'actors', 'film', 'experience', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'strong', 'performances', 'Ila', 'Schactler', 'show', 'screen', 'presence', 'trio', 'victim', 'Kayla', 'though', 'decent', 'musician', 'guitar', 'segment', 'film', 'seemed', 'more', 'unscripted', 'afterthought', 'was', ""n't"", 'needed.Meadowoods', 'already', 'received', 'five-star', 'review', 'someone', 'Seattle', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'where', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'gave', 'new', 'actors', 'film', 'experience', 'think', 'boring', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'dollar', 'Redbox', 'let', 'alone', 'buying', 'DVD']",N/A

In one sense, it's frightening because when you consider the ""real"" news headlines of our times..., the sort of thing that takes place in this movie does not seem far fetched.There are some segments of this film that are simply boring..., the overly long build-up to the actual criminal act..., all the home-movie type of interviews they hold with each other about their plans for committing a horrible crime begin to wear very thin as the movie progresses.  But there are moments when you see that there is an internal struggle with one of the three college kids who gradually finds his conscience and doesn't want to go through with the plan. And you wonder how.. or if... he can stop it from happening.  And you do feel the dread and horror of the poor victim in this case, the nightmare she suffers for no good reason at all..., just because the vicious sadistic leader of the trio wants to know what it's like to torture someone to death.This is not for the average horror-film fan, it requires some patience while the film builds up to the meat of the story.  But in the end I found it worth watching for the sad and very disturbing commentary it makes about how some people are living on the edge of sanity.- Mike Silverman",3,WORTH A LOOK,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",2010,1267,"['movie', 'hard', 'describe', 'one', 'sense', 'frightening', 'when', 'consider', 'real', 'news', 'headlines', 'times', 'sort', 'thing', 'place', 'movie', 'not', 'seem', 'far', 'are', 'segments', 'film', 'are', 'simply', 'boring', 'overly', 'long', 'build-up', 'actual', 'criminal', 'act', 'home-movie', 'type', 'interviews', 'hold', 'other', 'plans', 'committing', 'horrible', 'crime', 'begin', 'wear', 'very', 'thin', 'movie', 'are', 'moments', 'when', 'see', 'internal', 'struggle', 'one', 'three', 'college', 'kids', 'who', 'gradually', 'conscience', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'plan', 'wonder', 'how..', 'can', 'stop', 'happening', 'do', 'feel', 'dread', 'horror', 'poor', 'victim', 'case', 'nightmare', 'good', 'reason', 'just', 'vicious', 'sadistic', 'leader', 'trio', 'know', 'what', 'torture', 'someone', 'death.This', 'not', 'average', 'horror-film', 'fan', 'patience', 'film', 'meat', 'story', 'end', 'found', 'worth', 'watching', 'sad', 'very', 'disturbing', 'commentary', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'living', 'edge', 'sanity.-', 'Mike', 'Silverman']",N/A
