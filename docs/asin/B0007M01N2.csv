Because the synopsis describes these women's zest for life i expected something like Young@Heart (which i love), but this is like a bad nursing home experience. Although this senior home is filled with former activists, performers, etc, their memories have been lost and there are no good stories to be told. Even their presence at protest rallies is dull; if this is zest, i would hate to see doldrum. This film drags on and on with tedious conversation and left me half-asleep and depressed.",1,Blah,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",2013,533,"['Why', 'so', 'well-rated', 'synopsis', 'women', 'zest', 'life', 'i', 'expected', 'something', 'Young', '@', 'Heart', 'i', 'love', 'bad', 'nursing', 'home', 'experience', 'senior', 'home', 'filled', 'former', 'activists', 'performers', 'etc', 'memories', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'are', 'good', 'stories', 'be', 'told', 'Even', 'presence', 'protest', 'rallies', 'dull', 'zest', 'i', 'would', 'hate', 'see', 'doldrum', 'film', 'tedious', 'conversation', 'left', 'half-asleep', 'depressed']",N/A
882691,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0007M01N2,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Sunset Story paints a moving portrait of the relationship between two close friends both of whom are elderly residents of a retirement home in Los Angeles. Lucille Alpert is a somewhat sour Jewish lady whose family taught her to assimilate into mainstream American society. However, Lucille is a good, well meaning person beneath her gruff exterior. Lucille's friend is the always friendly, upbeat Irja Lloyd who taught school for people with developmental disabilities.One interesting aspect of these people and the other residents of the retirement home is that they were all involved with liberal or progressive causes in their younger years. Sunset Hall retirement home was founded in the early 1920s to provide a safe haven for elderly radicals who needed a place where they could get medical attention and socialize in their last years with us.I could go into more detail regarding the strong and touching bond between Lucille and Irja but then I would be giving too much away; and I don't want to spoil it for you. Suffice it to say that you will be moved by this fine documentary. The footage of the other senior residents of Sunset Hall and groups of residents who still go to political protests is also very good.The DVD comes with some nice bonus features. There are two commentaries; one is with director/producer Laura Gabbert and producers Caroline Libresco and Eden Wurmfeld. The second commentary is with director/producer Laura Gabbert, editor William Haugse and cinematographer Shana Hagan. There are deleted and extended scenes; and we get other filmed interviews as well. You can watch the question and answer forum at the 2003 LA/IFP film festival and the theatrical trailer is provided--with even more!Sunset Story is a bittersweet but touching documentary that I thoroughly enjoyed. I recommend this film for people who like documentaries and people who are interested in aging and the issues surrounding aging.",5,"a film with courage, humor and realism",1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,1934,"['Sunset', 'Story', 'moving', 'portrait', 'relationship', 'two', 'close', 'friends', 'whom', 'are', 'elderly', 'residents', 'retirement', 'home', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Lucille', 'Alpert', 'somewhat', 'sour', 'Jewish', 'lady', 'family', 'taught', 'assimilate', 'mainstream', 'American', 'society', 'However', 'Lucille', 'good', 'well', 'meaning', 'person', 'gruff', 'exterior', 'Lucille', 'friend', 'always', 'friendly', 'upbeat', 'Irja', 'Lloyd', 'who', 'taught', 'school', 'people', 'developmental', 'disabilities.One', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'people', 'other', 'residents', 'retirement', 'home', 'were', 'involved', 'liberal', 'progressive', 'causes', 'younger', 'years', 'Sunset', 'Hall', 'retirement', 'home', 'was', 'founded', 'early', '1920s', 'provide', 'safe', 'haven', 'elderly', 'radicals', 'who', 'needed', 'place', 'where', 'could', 'get', 'medical', 'attention', 'socialize', 'last', 'years', 'us.I', 'could', 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'regarding', 'strong', 'touching', 'bond', 'Lucille', 'Irja', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'Suffice', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'fine', 'documentary', 'footage', 'other', 'senior', 'residents', 'Sunset', 'Hall', 'groups', 'residents', 'who', 'still', 'go', 'political', 'protests', 'also', 'very', 'good.The', 'DVD', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'two', 'commentaries', 'one', 'director/producer', 'Laura', 'Gabbert', 'producers', 'Caroline', 'Libresco', 'Eden', 'Wurmfeld', 'second', 'commentary', 'director/producer', 'Laura', 'Gabbert', 'editor', 'William', 'Haugse', 'cinematographer', 'Shana', 'Hagan', 'are', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'get', 'other', 'filmed', 'interviews', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'watch', 'question', 'answer', 'forum', '2003', 'LA/IFP', 'film', 'festival', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'provided', 'even', 'more', 'Sunset', 'Story', 'bittersweet', 'touching', 'documentary', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'documentaries', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'aging', 'issues', 'surrounding', 'aging']",N/A

I'm recommending it to all my friends at the assisted living Lodge where I call Bingo.  For those who have not had much experience with ""the backside of life,"" who, unlike this reviewer, have not spent a lot of time visiting relatives in Nursing Homes and Assisted Living Facilities, this film about a ""Rest Home' for retired radicals"" shows that residence in these places does *not* have to be the end or drastic curtailment of who one is or one's passions. If I lived closer to LA, so that my friends and relatives here could come visit me there, I would move to Sunset Hall in a heartbeat when my time comes.The central tale of two women there is well told and a timeless story of life, liberty and loyalty for all. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",5,Life. and.
