Lamarr is great looking and acts well in this one and Spencer Tracy is always good.

Hedy Lamarr looks as good as she's ever looked in a movie, and Spencer Tracy does a great job as well.  Very entertaining from beginning to end.  If I'd find fault in it at all I would say that I thought the ending was a little cheesy, but it didn't spoil my overall enjoyment of the film.  I do recommend it to fans of either Hedy or Spencer.",4,I Take This Woman Review,1269302400,"03 23, 2010",2010,381,"['found', 'film', 'be', 'rather', 'good', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'as', 'good', 'ever', 'looked', 'movie', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'great', 'job', 'as', 'well', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'beginning', 'end', ""'d"", 'find', 'fault', 'would', 'say', 'thought', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'cheesy', 'did', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'do', 'recommend', 'fans', 'Hedy', 'Spencer']",N/A
1316762,A37S3ACL57LN62,B003156IK2,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[4, 5]","After saving beautiful society girl Georgi (Hedy Lamarr) from suicide on board a ship heading back to America, Dr. Karl Decker (Spencer Tracy) finds himself counseling her on how to make life worthwhile. To keep her mind off of the man who didn't divorce his wife for her, she begins helping the doctor in his practice in the slums of New York, work that she enjoys very much. Before long, Karl proposes, and Georgi hesitantly but happily accepts, excited for the prospect of a new and happy life.Of course, she has not completely confronted her previous lover, and as the couple becomes more and more involved in society, she sees him more and more. Will she be able to put past love aside for a new one?I Take This Woman is an inconsequential love story, fun but not remarkable. It is worth watching for its talented cast, including Verree Teasdale as Georgi's pushy couturier friend, Paul Cavanagh as the concerned father of a woman very similar to Georgi, and Frances Drake as Georgi's lovely nightclub friend.",4,A Beautiful Cast and an Unremarkable Story,1317859200,"10 6, 2011",2011,1014,"['saving', 'beautiful', 'society', 'girl', 'Georgi', 'Hedy', 'Lamarr', 'suicide', 'board', 'ship', 'heading', 'back', 'America', 'Dr.', 'Karl', 'Decker', 'Spencer', 'Tracy', 'counseling', 'how', 'make', 'life', 'worthwhile', 'keep', 'mind', 'man', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'divorce', 'wife', 'helping', 'doctor', 'practice', 'slums', 'New', 'York', 'work', 'very', 'much', 'long', 'Karl', 'Georgi', 'hesitantly', 'happily', 'accepts', 'excited', 'prospect', 'new', 'happy', 'life.Of', 'course', 'not', 'completely', 'confronted', 'previous', 'lover', 'couple', 'more', 'more', 'involved', 'society', 'more', 'more', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'past', 'love', 'aside', 'new', 'one', 'Take', 'Woman', 'inconsequential', 'love', 'story', 'fun', 'not', 'remarkable', 'worth', 'watching', 'talented', 'cast', 'including', 'Verree', 'Teasdale', 'Georgi', 'pushy', 'couturier', 'friend', 'Paul', 'Cavanagh', 'concerned', 'father', 'woman', 'very', 'similar', 'Georgi', 'Frances', 'Drake', 'Georgi', 'lovely', 'nightclub', 'friend']",N/A
