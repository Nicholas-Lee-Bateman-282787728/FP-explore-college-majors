After watching most of season one of 'The Good Wife', I was rudely reminded of the entertainment industry's attempt to bring out their left-wing views in the guise of entertainment. Case in point; when a ballistics expert was introduced, a picture of Mrs. Clinton was on the desk behind the character played by Ms Baranski. Upon a visit to the expert's home, there was a picture of the ballistics expert with Sarah Palin. And so the lines are drawn. So far, no problem. That is until Ms Baranski's character said later in the episode referring to Mrs. Palin, quote, ""She is the devil incarnate."", unquote. How absolutely unbelievable that this blatant bias should raise its ugly head in the middle of ""entertainment"". Needless to say, Mrs. Clinton came away unscathed.Although now seeing the series through a different, skewed lens, I decided to watch another episode. Again, I saw the ugly head of bias begin to rise this time regarding a cartoon in a newspaper. I stopped watching it.

Marold""","[0, 0]","When this show first aired, like a lot of other shows, there was nothing about it, aside from the fact that a regular guest star was Chris Noth, a better than average detective role on Law and Order. Not enough to have me set aside an hour each week to watch it. Since it first aired, I've seen another big legal show, &#34;Suits&#34;, and it was just a tad unrealistic, in the way &#34;House&#34; is unrealistic in that it seems the main character would never get away with some of the things House and Harvey Specter pull.But then, I started watching early &#34;ER&#34; episodes, where &#34;The Good Wife&#34; lead, Julianna Margulies, was a prominent character, and one of the main reasons for watching &#34;ER&#34; for the first seven seasons. Margulies is not alone. Her two best supporting actors are Josh Charles, from &#34;Sports Night&#34; and Christine Baranski, from guest appearances going back 30 years. Both are more realistic than the principle partners on &#34;Suits&#34;.Other actors also add a lot. Chris Noth is solid in his role. Archie Panjabi, as Margulies' firm's investigator is first rate for a young actor. Even better is Alan Cumming, who plays the political expert behind the Noth character's rehabilitation. He's a lot like the Bruno Gianelli character on &#34;The West Wing&#34;, except that his role is not quite so exaggerated. He really plays the part of a back room &#34;wartime consigliore&#34;.Everything really &#34;clicks&#34; in this first season. It all works so well that I hope the wheels don't come off for at least another two or three seasons. What may be missing is that unlike the ER, there is little room to add additional permanent cast members.Executive producer is Ridley Scott, and this show has the same nice 3 part balance between home, office, and courtroom that I liked in &#34;Numb3rs.&#34; wish it luck.

Then I decided to pick up a copy of the first season at a local store.  Holy gadzoley, betty spagehtti!  I'm late to the game, but happy to be here! (And I've been telling folks about this show ever since finishing the First Season DVD set).I can _truly_ say I haven't been blown away by many TV shows upon first watching them.  Shows as varied as ""Felicity"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", ""Wonderfalls"", ""Once and Again"", ""Firefly"", ""Dexter"", ""Trueblood"" and ""The Wire"", caught and held my attention because of the quality of the writing (And with two exceptions, I discovered them all on DVD).  ""The Good Wife"" is jam-packed with excellent writing (here's hoping that continues into season 2 -- I'm waiting for the DVDs).  But as with those other shows mentioned, this show also has a great cast of actors: Marguiles, North and Panjabi -- excellent actors all -- lead a cast that does justice (no pun intended) to the terrific scripts they are given (the quality _does_ range, but it never goes below very good, and usually veers closer to excellent).  Not all the cases end up with a feel good, happy ending type denoument, nor do the relationships all go smoothly -- as it should be.  What's more, not even the title character is a ""good"" or ""bad"" -- merely complex, merely human, capable of both.Like the aforementioned shows, ""The Good Wife"" is a series so high in quality, I've bought it on DVD so I can rewatch from time to time.

Fox is coming aboard for some episodes of this show's second season to play an attorney.  He recently won an Emmy for doing the same on RESCUE ME.  I am very excited about this as I think he will be a very good foil for these characters.  My original review follows.This show never ignores its central premise: what is it like being the wife of one of these political figures who gets involved in a lurid sex scandal.  Julia Marguiles does a very good job answering that question week in and week out.  Chris Noth plays her sex scandal husband.  Some viewers know him from SEX AND THE CITY while others know him from LAW & ORDER shows, both the original and CRIMINAL INTENT. He also does a very good job because you never like or trust him.  His role is getting meatier as the weeks go on and that is all to the good. I frankly would be tempted to just dump him in her place but she holds on for a variety of reasons, the most compelling being her two teen children who are already deeply conflicted by their father's behavior.  He starts out the season in prison and the action steps up when he is allowed to come home under house arrest, with an ankle bracelet. She is left as the main wage earner and she is a very good attorney in her own right. At her firm, she is surrounded by a partner, who is clearly smitten by her, another partner who is the reigning superwoman, and a woman private investigator for the firm, who is fast becoming one of the breakout stars from the series.

I get network shows free and caught a few episodes of the Good Wife. It's what, in its 4th season now? So I decided to see if the earlier seasons were in Prime. And they are. I am almost done with Season 1.Alicia Florrick, played by Julianna Margulies, is the central character. A former stay at home mom who happens to have a current license to practice law in Cook County. &#34;Former: stay at home mom because her husband, Peter, played by Chris Noth, is a former Cook COunty state's attorney, is in prison for corruption. This alone got me interested because I lived in Chicagoland for most of my life and keep current on Chicago/Illinois politics. So, this plot is reality TV so far. It wasn't just corruption, though, but a juicy sex scandal.Alicia is forced to sell the huge house in the suburbs. Not sure where, but I envision Highland Park in my head. She rents a two-bedroom apartment. It's a very nice apartment and has a maid's room, so it's probably in the city or at least in an older area, because, really, what apartments have maid's rooms? Anyway, Alicia manages to get hired on as a junior associate at a prestigious law firm. One of the managing partners is her law-school classmate, Wil Gardner. He's a hottie and single. And he has an eye for Alicia. And vice versa. Ah, some sexual tension.Alicia, for all her rustiness at practicing law, is a great lawyer. She has incredible common sense, attention to detail, and a whole lot of Chicago connections, that make her super-lawyer/private investigator all in one. Oh, and she wears skirt suits and heels all the time. Well, most of the time.Peter is angling for release from prison. He wants to make up with Alicia. He seems to think this will happen. A few $3,000 hookers here and there is no biggie, I suppose. Alicia is still ticked at him. Duh. So, even if Peter gets out of prison, will he have a sweet little good wife to come home to?Add in an officious but well-meaning mother-in-law, two teenage kids, a supporting cast with depth in characters, and you've got something for everyone!This reminds me of LA Law somewhat except that each episode builds on the last and it could be confusing to just watch them individually.

If you can get past the shows slightly rocky beginning, great rewards lie ahead!  High praise for ""The Good Wife"" is fully merited, and I'd give the show 5 stars if I hadn't foolishly written my original interview after having only watched the first 5 episodes (with which I was not greatly impressed). Not long after that however I did start becoming intrigued by the show.  The actors suddenly ""became"" the characters, the plot thickened very effectively and the story suddenly began to show a great deal of depth and breadth - in effect, it found its groove (I remember similar experience with ""The Wire"" which also started off weakly - though perhaps had fewer weak initial shows).In every episode of ""The Good Wife"" you get both an individual case for the episode along with the continuing story saga of Alicia and her husband (and family).  While I wasn't convinced by the saga part of the story initially (not to mention some of the episode cases), the quality of both the episode cases AND the family saga started to become a lot more interesting as the season evolves, as if the show had gotten new writers or as if the old ones had started giving their audiences more credit.  The saga element while weak in the beginning starts gaining prominence as the show continues and the characters round out into more interesting individuals as the stories themselves become better.I'd fully recommend ""The Good Wife"" to anyone who likes courtroom drama and a continuing cliffhanger saga laced with politics, law, the ironies of destiny and forbidden love!

Josh Charles as Will Gardner lacks leading man looks and charisma. Matt Czuchry as Cary Agos is completely uninteresting in every way. Julianna Margulies, while interesting and likeable, has far too many silent introspective moments during engagements where no normal person would remain silent. At times, she's like a mannequin in need of animation. Alan Cumming as Eli Gold is wonderful; he absolutely nails this character in a funny and endearing way. Chris Noth is well cast for his role, however they need to liberate him to be the ""Strong"" States Attorney alpha male rather than a detached and milk-toast husband to Alicia. When they do allow Noth to be the ""Strong"" States Attorney, he is great!  Christine Baranski plays Christine Baranski in every role she's in, but she does glue the cast and story line together well. By far and away the most likeable character of the show is Graham Phillips, as Alicia's & Peter's son, who is as spot-on with his role as Alan Cumming is with his.  Zach Grenier as David Lee is a wonderful antagonist at times to Eli Gold and others. Archie Panjabi, as Kalinda, would have been the most interesting character in the program had they cast someone equally interesting in the role of her estranged husband; a total mis-cast.

She wants to feed her family and be independant, she needs to keep her job as a lawyer, she wants to play clean, she does not want to be involved with her husband's trials and campaigns ... how to reconcile all this?The price that I pay here is that I am glued to the screen much longer than I ever expected.

1343964,A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,B003FSTN52,"Judy K. Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[102, 116]","""The Good Wife"" ranks at the very top, in the cream of the cream, of the best television series ever created. Such a strong statement needs verification. Just what makes this weekly series so powerful?1. Julianne Margulies, foremost, plays the ""good wife"" in perfect pitch. The wife wronged by her successful, ambitious, attractive, but absolutely corrupt husband (the gorgeous Chris Noth) as a fallen, disreputable district attorney, you know, the kind voters love to put back into office. Then there's the sex scandal that horribly embarrasses both his ""good wife"" and children? What is her reaction to his scandal? How does she cope?2. Her education as an attorney, no, not just an attorney, but an insightful, resourceful, brilliant attorney, not only gets her a job quickly, but proves she deserves it.3. Kalinda, the private investigator is the biggest mystery on the show. Just whose side is she on? Just whom has she been intimate with? She represents the ultimate pragmatist, the bottom-liner. She gets my vote as the most mysterious and intriguing of all the characters!4. Add the mother-in-law, who is helping out while son tries to get out of jail. Viewers eventually discover that she is one of those controlling mothers who push their children onto the success track at any cost.5. One strand involves the growing attraction between Margulies and her male boss whom she knew in college.  Although not the gorgeous, virile type (like her husband), he represents the intelligent, successful, but perpetual bachelor, one to be wary of.6. Which also includes office politics and two more fascinating characters: the driven woman partner (whose own love interest is one of the pings later described) and the young male attorney also vying for the one slot that both the Margulies character and he fiercely want.6. Another Subplot involves her son and a cougar-like older girl intent on using the boy for her own devious plans.Now wrap all this back story into the various strands that it takes to create a tightly woven plot, utterly fascinating, utterly unpredictable. Ping! What?! Yes, something came loose. What is it? Something that makes this series so gripping, so unexpected, so dramatic that viewers are on the edge of their seats, expectant, breathless. Frankly, I've been stunned any number of times.Addition: Two days after publishing this review, I realized I had covered only one-half of the program. The personal lives of the characters make up one-half, the other half concerns the weekly trial (after all, this is partially a courtroom drama). Each case is unique and equally fascinating. Just as in real life, each case is not necessarily resolved for the viewer's total satisfaction. Sometimes the viewer--and the attorney--don't really know if the client is truly innocent.

In my opinion, the ONLY thing GOOD about this show was its acting.  Period!  The storyline:  here's a woman who stands by her man.  Through anything!  Here's a wonderful, gorgeous, marvelous man who cheats on his wife, not once or twice (which could, indeed, be forgiven -- but numerous times.  (You might detect sarcasm here.)  Meanwhile, she is Suzy Homemaker, running the house, caring for her family -- being a wife and mother.  Then, his political kingdom takes a serious fall and viola!  He realizes he is in love with wife after all.  He goes to jail.  She goes to work becoming the bread winner and her career takes off.  Because there are children between this exemplary couple, they remain on friendly terms.  Okay so far.  Then we move into all of the usual Hollywood re-educational propaganda!  The numerous plot twists and turns taking the human being to its lowest common denominator!  Just another typical nighttime Soap Opera.  Nothing new here.  Except that the television industry seems determined to move womanhood backward and NOT forward.  Oh, you say:  but she's a lawyer -- good career choice and good example for woman???  I agree ..... if she is single ... or if there is a truly loving cohesive family structure so that the kids are properly emotionally, spiritually as well as physically nourished  ... or if the kids are grown, or if there is a true need for both parents to work.  Look at the kids in this show.  No, they do not demonstrate good emotional nourishment.  No good ethics, no truly good character traits, no good morality.  This show is demonstrative of the state of most American households and thinking these days.  Look at our young today.  In the past, many of our families had both parents working to make a living.  Yet, those parents knew how to instill good values into their kids to produce honest, decent people to move this Country forward.  Look at our society today.  Clearly we model ourselves after our Soaps.  And we wonder why this Country is failing!  We watch anything and model ourselves after what we see.  Once upon a time, we, as a society, were concerned about our young and their character development.  Today, we just want to be like the neighbors next door.  No matter what they are really like.  So, if you want to be like that and your children to be like that, then watch this show.  And watch our society continue to crumble.  Oh yes.  I am sure their are countless many in this Country who would disagree with this review of this show.  When you watch just to see what is on the screen with your eyes and not your brain, then certainly you would disagree with me.  But, our children are watching and they do likewise.  It used to be that soft porn was objectionable to every decent human being.  Now we have soft porn in our tv shows and movies.  Its okay because we have been trained to accept it.

1343977,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B003FSTN52,Kate McMurry,"[189, 203]","Never was a phrase, ""torn from the headlines,"" more appropriate for a TV show. This dramatic tale of a wronged politician's wife brings instantly to mind famous couples such as Bill and Hillary Clinton, John and Elizabeth Edwards, Darlene and John Ensign, Jenny and Mark Sanford, and David and Wendy Vitter. But the circumstances that most closely resemble those used in ""The Good Wife"" are those of Silda and Eliot Spitzer. In 2008, Spitzer resigned as governor of New York after it was revealed that he had spent public funds on high-priced call girls. In his case, his resignation halted potential prosecution. Not so for Peter Florrick (Chris Noth, best known as Mr. Big, Carrie's lover inSex and the City). In ""The Good Wife,"" the husband of the titular ""good wife,"" resigns as the state's attorney of Cook County, in the Chicago area of Illinois, after he's exposed for the same crime as Spitzer. But his successor gets Peter thrown in jail.The series' opening scene involves Peter's wife, Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies,ER), nobly, and humiliatingly, backing up Peter as he announces to the press he is resigning. Then the scene switches to six months in the future. Peter is in jail. Alicia has been forced to downsize from a big house to an apartment, and she's looking for a job. For her entire marriage, Alicia has sacrificed her education and professional talents in favor of supporting her husband's political career and caring for their two children, now young teenagers. But with Peter's needs now moot, and his income gone, it's time to dust off her law degree and seek a paid position.Though she is forty-something and out of touch with the legal world, Alicia manages to use one of her own connections to snag a position as a junior associate at the firm of a friend from law school, Will Gardner (Josh Charles, best known forSports Night). But the job has two major drawbacks. First, Will sees her as the one that got away, and Alicia is in no mood for that kind of complication. And, second, the job is not secure. She is in competition with another new junior associate, Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry, Rory's college boyfriend inGilmore Girls), who is the very definition of a whiz kid. Worse, though Cary is extremely competitive, Alicia is naturally collegial and kind, and it goes totally against the grain for her to try and cut anyone out.I was sold on this show from the opening scene of the pilot. Every actor in it is great, but the three main female actors are particular standouts. First and foremost, Margulies is wonderful. In fact, one might say she was made for this part. It requires some of the most difficult skills an actor can have, in my humble opinion, to subtly indicate a whole range of emotion on the face of a character who is dignified and reserved by nature. Margulies manages to accomplish this with astounding ease given the limitations of her character's personality. It would have been out of character, for example, for Alicia to employ standard ""bits of business"" that other actors use such as grabbing or shoving to show anger. Instead, she shows subtle nuances of expression. Most of all, Margulies reveals Alicia to us by displaying in every scene perhaps Alicia's most sterling virtue, a quiet empathy which connects her to and draws out every other character she comes in contact with. This quality coupled with keen observation and a brilliant, analytical mind are the main attributes that allow Alicia to not only succeed as a trial attorney but to solve mysteries surrounding the cases she takes on--allowing this series to be a fascinating combination of mystery, political, legal and relationship drama, all rolled into one. Most of all, Margulies's talent as an actor allows the audience to understand and believe in every choice that Alicia makes, no matter how difficult, from the loyalty she displays to the unfaithful husband she obviously has loved deeply for many years, to her firm but affectionate relationship with her children, to her tactful handling of her meddling mother-in-law, to her often morally ambiguous encounters with her co-workers and her clients.The second amazing woman in this series is the ever marvelous Christine Baranski (Mamma Mia!andCybill) as Diane Lockhart, a co-partner with Alicia's boss Will. It does not surprise me that a comic actor as phenomenal as Baranski is also an outstanding dramatic actor. Most actors seem to agree that doing comedy is so difficult that drama seems comparatively easy. In this series, Baranski's character Diane has a complex relationship with Alicia and has plenty of juicy plot lines of her own.The third female actor whose performance I greatly admire is Archie Panjaba (the heroine's older sister inBend It Like Beckham), who plays the enigmatic Kalinda Sharma. Kalinda rather rapidly develops what seems to be a strong friendship with Alicia, demonstrating an amazing amount of helpfulness and loyalty to her. But Kalinda's background and true intentions toward Alicia remain intriguingly unclear throughout the whole first season.Among the male actors, my personal favorite is the fabulously versatile Scottish actor Alan Cumming (Glitch the Scarecrow inTin Manand Nightcrawler inX-Men). He plays Peter's cunning political adviser, Eli Gold, and this role is the dead opposite of the odd, quirky types he's most famous for. Eli is conservative and muted, almost benignly invisible in his presentation to the general public. But underneath he seethes with passion and is a powerful, back-room player in the world of politics. His relationship with Alicia is one of the most dynamic in the series and his role in one of the key decisions she makes at the climax of season 1 is absolutely pitch perfect. And, by the way, his American accent is perfect.I personally adore dramas that present the protagonist with moral dilemmas every week that are filled with shades of gray. This series abounds in that dynamic. I also much prefer dramas that have two clear story tracks, the protagonist's professional life (in this series a weekly legal case for Alicia to pursue, with a frequent mystery thrown into the mix as I mentioned above), and the protagonist's personal life. Because of Peter's scandal, there are plenty of juicy sinkholes for Alicia to inadvertently step into as she weaves her way through a landscape of seemingly endless people who want to use her or abuse her because of her connection to her husband. This thread in the series has allowed it to avoid falling into the aggravating pattern of so many dramatic TV series of melodramatic emphasis on the personal failings of the protagonist and her close family members in ways that often turn that protagonist from sympathetic to pathetic and annoying. I am greatly hoping this series continues to avoid that pitfall for many years to come.",5,A good wife with a lousy husband,1277510400,"06 26, 2010",2010,6837,"['Never', 'was', 'phrase', 'torn',

1343999,AXWJ5NGLE2736,B003FSTN52,Lady Ann,"[0, 0]","If you liked Julianna Margulies as Nurse Carol Hathaway in &#34;E.R.,&#34; you're going to love her as Alicia Florrick in this series. (Also, if you liked &#34;L.A. Law,&#34; this may be the show for you -- there are many similarities in structure.) This is Margulies' star vehicle and she takes it and runs with it. Her character is strong, but just vulnerable enough to keep her from being a caricature. I won't give a plot outline -- you can look that up elsewhere. Just know that each week a new legal case keeps the character and her cronies on the run both physically and intellectually, often trying to beat deadlines and/or keep one step ahead of the bad guys (usually the State's Attorney's office, where a disgruntled ex-employee seems hell-bent on destroying his former firm in general and Alicia Florrick specifically). Playing in the background of the title character's foray back into law -- necessitated by her politician-husband's arrest involving allegations of ill-gotten gains and a hooker named Amber -- we have his story of politics and candidacy; we have their husband-wife story (can they find their way back to each other after his betrayal?); we have their family story (they have two adolescent kids who are, by TV standards, amazingly NOT annoying or precocious at all); and we have her work relationships. At any given time, a lot is going on, and the writing is clever enough to pull all of the plot threads together into a lovely, lively, cohesive macrame of entertainment. The show is peopled with an array of interesting characters, including the tough-smart senior partner (played to snooty perfection by the we-love-her-so-much Christine Baranski), not one but two mysterious and gleefully unethical private investigators (Archie Panjabi, &#34;Bend It Like Beckham,&#34; and Scott Porter, &#34;Friday Night Lights&#34;), an attractive partner with whom Margulies' character shares a Past and a lot of intense temptation, The Husband (it's Mr. Big!), an evil State's Attorney (played most appropriately by the actor who played The Devil in &#34;Lost&#34;), and a fun variety of well-known guest stars in recurring roles as attorneys and judges (Meryl Streep's kid, Michael J. Fox, Jane Alexander for heaven's sake!). On the down side, there are a disproportionate number of Hollywood-thin, hot, 20-something female lawyers on the series (recurring or guest shots), all with in-your-face designer wardrobes and attitudes to match. I worked in law for 30 years and, believe me, in real life, even young, female attorneys come in different shapes and sizes, and their wardrobes are far more Ross than Armani. Speaking of age, Margulies is approaching 50. Since women are constantly judged on how well they're tallying up the years, let me say that she looks amazing on this show and, except perhaps for some eye work (it's hard to tell because her character wears a great deal of black eye makeup on the show, even to bed), it doesn't look like she's had plastic surgery.

Despite liking the cast, it looked like the usual evening soap opera which I find utterly uninteresting.  I was pleasantly surprised when in a fit of boredom I watched the first episode of season 1.  I found myself engaged in both the story line and characters.  The acting is superb.  Julianna Margulies was so immersed in her character that I didn't even think once (past the opening credits) about her role as a nurse on ER.  I've not had this reaction to acting since Helen Mirren's performance in Prime Suspect.  Not that this show is as good or gritty as Prime Suspect, the two are not comparable - but the acting is.  Christine Baranski was her usual wonderful self, though I did find myself hoping that she'd say &#34;Doctor Dick&#34; just once.

I have often received DVD sets from Amazon that made me wonder if they were used and re-wrapped in plastic but this time there was no question about it. I have never returned any DVDs to Amazon for this reason feeling that maybe I was being too picky nor have I ever returned any multiple sets where the plastic hub inside was broken, allowing a DVD to rattle around and sometimes scratching. Both conditions have occurred numerous times- I've purchased a lot of DVDs from Amazon. As long as a DVD played relatively well, I accepted it. I kept this set too since I was very interested in seeing the show and didn't want to wait for a replacement, but the condition has bothered me more and more as time passes.

She is &#34;good&#34; because she puts her personal wants last, but as we get to see over and over, she doesn't forget herself. She always seems bent on doing the right thing in every situation and circumstance and we get to share her method of deciding.

I believe these people are who they pretend to be.And I love watching these programs without commercials.

Office dynamics are also cliched with the two newbie lawyers at the partnership apparently pitted against one another for one actual position and each supported by a different partner who tries to upset the other's chances.
