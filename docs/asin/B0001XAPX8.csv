No matter how scruffy and wain the filmmakers try to make Nicole Kidman look, she's still Nicole Kidman. Her portrayal of a janitor really pushes the limits of ""suspension of disbelief"" with her delicate features and legs that go on forever.And Anthony Hopkins is also miscast as a Jewish professor with a hard knock, secret past. While he remains one of my favorite actors, he cannot escape his ""Britishness"" which is even more unbelievable once you discover what his character's past is! The real discovery of this film is Wentworth Miller's absolutely astonishing turn as the teenage Anthony Hopkins.Ultimately, the film is worth seeing for Wentworth Miller alone.

816386,A36A9HWQ9U1IK4,B0001XAPX8,"A. Jogalekar ""Curious Wavefunction""","[2, 2]","The Human Stain takes a penetrating look at the myths with which society surrounds itself in order to remain `respectable', and how those myths are simply a portal into another level of suffering. It portrays the stains which persist in society, and which, even after constant cleansing, get perpetuated into the future and our lives in one form or the other.I thought that the theme was very interesting, the movie itself, less so. Anthony Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a highly respected Professor of Classics at Athena College, Massachusetts. Right from his arrival, he has catapulted the College to fame and respectability, and has become Dean. His own respectability is undermined when he once innocently calls two black students, perpetually absent from class, as `spooks'. He is unaware of the derogatory meaning of the phrase, and the two students press charges against him. He resigns in anger, and the faculty members apparently are only too satisfied to let him go, because they want to avoid scandal. The year is 1998, and the country itself is enveloped in the throes of a scandal-the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.Silk's wife dies from the shock of the accusations, and Silk becomes a lonely, dark, grudging man. Some solace comes in the form of a friendship with a young writer (Gary Sinise), himself living in seclusion in the woods after a hard fight with cancer. But the wheels of Silk's destiny really start turning when he begins an intense affair with an illiterate janitor (Nicole Kidman), many years younger than him. In turn, she faces chronic problems of her own, including an abusive childhood and a drunken, raucous and abusive Vietnam veteran husband. The rest of the movie essentially revolves about Silk's tumultuous and scandalous present life, and a disturbing past, which harbours a dark secret. I won't give it away for those of you who haven't watched it, but let it suffice here to say that he is running away from a stain which was inflicted on him many years back, as a young man in love, and an expert boxer. Silk's life long attempts to hide that old stain ironically have landed him into another disturbed existence.I thought that the movie itself failed to be very interesting, although the director seems to have made sincere attempts to keep the intrigue and philosophy flowing. The one thing that shines through are the performances by Hopkins, Sinise and Kidman. The Human Stain makes an interesting foray into the inevitabilities of life. If we hide from a truth, it's very likely that another will haunt us, just like it haunted Silk. Better than that to face the truth and fight for it. But the problem is still not resolved. Society still has to inure itself to many blatant and supposedly embarrassing eventualities in it's citizens' lives. We still have to come to terms with the ugly ducklings among us, moralizing and generous as our expressed views and opinions about them may be. Society itself has a long way to go before it becomes all-accommodating. The most penetrating stains, it seems, are the ones which cannot be seen.",4,Theme and performances: Excellent.

I'm not sure that the brief female nudity was necessary, but the pacing, the cinematography, and wonderful performances by the always amazing Hopkins, the increasingly deep Kidman, and the ever competent Sinise and Harris make for a film that is complex, suspenseful, and affecting.

816388,AUW8TCRK9EDQ6,B0001XAPX8,Andre LeBlanc,"[3, 3]","The Human Stain"" is an interesting film about the bond between an unlikely couple (played by Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins).  The one thing they seem to have in common is a life of emotional heartbreak, loneliness, and pain.  The film basically tells the story of their lives and eventual coming together through a series of flashbacks.  I did not find these flashbacks at all confusing as some reviewers have.  However, the film is somewhat flawed and lacking.  It has a tendency to drag slightly and never really takes off.  The ending is somewhat disappointing and could have been written much more effectively.  However, the acting performances are outstanding.  I think this is Nicole Kidman's best acting role.  Her performance as an emotionally weakened, unsophisticated woman is outstanding.  Also brilliant are Anthony Hopkins and Gary Sinise (a friend of Hopkins' character who narrates the movie).  And Ed Harris does a good job playing Kidman's psychotic ex-husband.

816389,A355VZC33RZGNA,B0001XAPX8,A Viewer and Reader,"[25, 29]","This is a film that is a masterpiece not only for what it says but in the way it says it.We have a man who looks white but is black, pretends to be a Jew, and lives a life of deception. We have a woman with a background that gives her every advantage but she is destroyed because she was molested as a child due to her ravishing beauty.  At the very moment when these two finally find peace in each other's arms they are wiped out by the insanity of evil.Coleman's story unfolds in a series of perplexing flashbacks that leaves the viewer confounded until we finally discover that Coleman Silk and the black boxer are one and the same.  Faunia's story is equally confusing. It is unreasonable that this utterly gorgeous young woman is so casually willing to give herself sexually to a rejected Viagra dependant old man. Why is she merely scraping out a living for herself sweeping floors and feeding cattle when you sense that she has so much more to offer?  What horror has brought her to this state of despair?  As her story unfolds in her final soliloquy with a caged crow  we find that she is so haunted by the blame she feels for the accidental death of her children, while she was distracted with a lover, that she is suicidal, emotionally detached, and devastated.Into this mix vengeance pursues Faunia in the form of her ex-husband, a tortured Viet Nam vet for whom killing has become a casual exercise. Lester Farley is a clever mixture of blind fate and conscious hate that only the writer, Zuckerman, ultimately understands and reveals to the world.What makes this film so artfully intriguing is the way the story unfolds in its seemingly chaotic fashion reflecting the chaos of the human condition the film is describing, and it is a story that is hard to take because it rings so heartbreakingly true.  The acting by the principals, Hopkins, Kidman, Sinise, Harris,and Miller is utterly outstanding in every way, and the film deserves repeated viewings from that standpoint alone.  As for the story itself, it takes a couple of viewings with patience and reflection to fully appreciate its authentic depths. Finally, in an ironic way, one might take comfort from Coleman's and Faunia's deaths that the moment at which they died was the moment at which they had reached fulfillment with each other.",5,The Heartbreaking Chaos Of The Human Condition,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2310,"['film', 'masterpiece', 'not', 'only', 'what', 'way', 'it.We', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'white', 'black', 'be', 'Jew', 'life', 'deception', 'have', 'woman', 'background', 'advantage', 'destroyed', 'was', 'molested', 'child', 'due', 'ravishing', 'beauty', 'very', 'moment', 'when', 'two', 'finally', 'find', 'peace', 'other', 'arms', 'are', 'wiped', 'out', 'insanity', 'evil.Coleman', 'story', 'unfolds', 'series', 'perplexing', 'flashbacks', 'viewer', 'confounded', 'finally', 'discover', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'black', 'boxer', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'Faunia', 'story', 'equally', 'confusing', 'unreasonable', 'utterly', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'so', 'casually', 'willing', 'give', 'sexually', 'rejected', 'Viagra', 'dependant', 'old', 'man', 'Why', 'merely', 'scraping', 'out', 'living', 'sweeping', 'floors', 'feeding', 'cattle', 'when', 'sense', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'What', 'horror', 'brought', 'state', 'despair', 'story', 'unfolds', 'final', 'soliloquy', 'caged', 'crow', 'find', 'so', 'haunted', 'blame', 'accidental', 'death', 'children', 'was', 'distracted', 'lover', 'suicidal', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'devastated.Into', 'mix', 'vengeance', 'pursues', 'Faunia', 'form', 'ex-husband', 'tortured', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'vet', 'whom', 'killing', 'become', 'casual', 'exercise', 'Lester', 'Farley', 'clever', 'mixture', 'blind', 'fate', 'conscious', 'hate', 'only', 'writer', 'Zuckerman', 'ultimately', 'understands', 'reveals', 'world.What', 'film', 'so', 'artfully', 'intriguing', 'way', 'story', 'seemingly', 'chaotic', 'fashion', 'reflecting', 'chaos', 'human', 'condition', 'film', 'describing', 'story', 'hard', 'take', 'so', 'heartbreakingly', 'true', 'acting', 'principals', 'Hopkins', 'Kidman', 'Sinise', 'Harris', 'Miller', 'utterly', 'outstanding', 'way', 'film', 'deserves', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'standpoint', 'alone', 'story', 'couple', 'viewings', 'patience', 'reflection', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'authentic', 'depths', 'Finally', 'ironic', 'way', 'one', 'might', 'take', 'comfort', 'Coleman', 'Faunia', 'deaths', 'moment', 'died', 'was', 'moment', 'had', 'reached', 'fulfillment', 'other']",The Human Stain
816390,A3C54XWT93R2WY,B0001XAPX8,"Been around this block, several times over","[2, 3]","At first I wondered why all the negative reviews.  But, then, this is a movie about regrets-- after all, that's what ""stains"" are, isn't it, things we regret . . . AND THEIR BEING ""HUMAN"" ONLY MAKES THEM OURS AND HENCE EVEN MORE SO . . . REGRETTABLE, THAT IS.I guess it comes down to where one is in his/her life, as well as where one's life is in the range of human existence, to determine what type and amount of tragedy one's narrative sense can tolerate.  Hence, for some people, I'm sure, ""The Human Stain"" just has too much, and too many kinds, of drama packed in to bear.  We have an advanced classics professorial career brought down by a casual remark taken for racism . . . irony of ironies, he's Black passing for white Jewish, but he won't give up his masquerade (and his rage at what he seeks to escape through passing is articulated through his early years as a winning boxer).  He seeks comfort in the embrace of a half-his-age woman who seeks herself escape from an abusive marriage and feel responsible for the death of her children . . . as well as being pursued by her ex-- in fact, it all starts with the professor and his mate dying in an accident intended to avoid an oncoming truck (which, it turns out, was driven by the ex).  And the story is told by an Viet-vet writer who has grown too callused from all the killing to feel any more.  People today are quick to use the phrase, ""That's more information than I wanted,"" so I can understand some viewers declaring: ""That too much drama for one lifetime, much less one movie!""So here you are. How old are you? How much life have you been through? How much and how often have you seen tragedy happen ALL AT ONCE . . . or interconnected? Etc, etc, etc.  Most people lose it if a narrative has more than one story line.  They can't keep track of the events-- NOT ""cognitive"" track, but ""emotional"" track.  That is to say, they can't bring themselves to care about so many evolving lives spinning out of control in one film.  One is reminded here of the movie ""Traffic,"" which brings you several story lines, but unravels them only one at a time before bringing them all together at the end.  Not here; so your heart strings are kept in a constant state of pulled, first to the right, then to the left, and simultaneously all around as well.  Outstanding war movies do that as battlefield events spare no one with the randomness of anonymously flying bullets.  Well, things sort of evolve that way here, with no end in sight in how many victims are rolled up along the way.To me, I've been through such a wide range of experience, and I'm of an age where I have had an awful lot of it-- and, to top it off, I'm a psychotherapist, so I've had to take in and process a heck of a lot of other people's tragedy-- that I felt some relief seeing things portrayed on the screen a bit like they are etched on my soul.  You don't have to be depressed to connect with the tragic, BUT YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WELL TRAVELED!!!This movie will certainly test and separate boys and girls from men and women in the amount and extent of gravity it has managed to pack in one continuous narrative-- sort of like sitting on Jupiter as opposed to Earth. For example, it calls upon one to have a multidimensional sense of the Black-American experience, as well as its not-always-mutually-satisfying intersections with that of American Jewry-- the author of the original book is Phillip Roth, and the film was made by Robert Benton (of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" or ""Places in the Heart"" acclaim)-- so one is certain to have his/her unilinear/'good-guys-victims"" vs. ""bad-guys-perpetrators"" conception of social issues and movements shot to Hell.  Then there's the matter of older guy with younger woman: that gets played to a high tension in this flick (with an relatively unspoken racial sexuality touch).  And we end with a killing that can't be pinned on the killer because ""I didn't kill them . . . they killed themselves!"" (and he ACTUALLY manages to make it stick, to the utter consternation of all movie goers used to The Code's expectation that Justice will always be portrayed to win out in the end).  Nobody wins here, and American movie goers so love to see a winner!!I don't want to come off pompous, but this movie is definitely one for MATURE tastes.  You have to have been around the block a few times and find yourself with a lot less to show for it than you would have thought you would when you began your journey.  And then there's the matter of age . . . that is, reaching the stage of one's life where the horizon no longer keeps backing up and disappearing behind the vanishing point as you proceed forwards-- i.e., the end first starts becoming visible, and then starts to stay that way no matter what.  In youth it keeps retreating behind the a sense of future still to coe as we rebound and move on to ""the next thing,"" but later on, as there seem to be less and less do-overs granted one, this sort of ""running smack into a no longer retreating horizon"" movie starts to make a lot of painful sense (some movie-goers, of course, never allow themselves that realization, for they often go to the movies precisely to avoid it).  In interviews where actors and directors come to hawk their latest releases, I've often heard the person being interviewed suddenly do a back-up and declare, ""I don't wanna give you the impression that this movie is a downer . . . .""  Well, this movie definitely is . . . a downer!  But in being so, it touches the heart with a reminder that we all come and go, and in passing we leave a ""human stain"" reflective of the sweep of human history-- and the writing hand moves forward, and having moved forth, it never comes back to rewrite anything again.BE BRAVE.

816402,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B0001XAPX8,C. Middleton,"[6, 8]","Based on the novel by Phillip Roth, this is a special film, exploring issues of race, hypocrisy, relationships and the tragedy of the human condition.Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a classics professor at an eastern Ivy League college. During his tenure as Dean of the school, he brought the college from a mediocre one to one of excellence. In the politics of academia, where bureaucracy can be so entrenched, change is the enemy, thus Coleman Silk's efforts towards excellence, inevitably makes a few enemies.In the late nineties, during the Clinton administration, the atmosphere of so-called political correctness hovered like a spectre, censorship reigned supreme, and as one of the characters at the end of the film states, ""People have become so dumb, but they all have an opinion."" Professor Silk makes the mistake of calling two conspicuously absent students ""spooks"", in the definitive context of absence or invisibility, not in the 50's slang for black American. In fact, he never met these students, but his words are taken as racial slurs because the students are black Americans. (This proves to be a great irony as the film progresses) This is an interesting example of censorship at the time, as in so many cases, the person or people crying racism or explicit sex or whatever the issue, more often than not, is taken out of context, turning it into something other than what it actually means. Out of principle, and because, out of fear, no one supports him, he is forced to resign just before his retirement. To add insult to injury, Silk's wife dies in his arms from a heart attack on that very day.Enter Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Siniese) the ""writer in hiding"" and narrator of the tale. The two men forge a bond that is both interesting and touching. The scene where they dance `cheek to cheek' on the porch over a sentimental song was a work of pure theatrical genius. There is no question that both these fine actors are at the top of their art form. It is here that Silk confesses that he is involved with a thirty-four year old woman. Enter Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful working class girl with a legion of personal issues: sexually abused as a child; a battered wife from a psychotic husband, (Ed Harris) and two dead children due to an accident that is explained in the film but remains vague. The relationship between Silk and Farley is an unusual one as there is a vast age difference and both are so different socially and otherwise. But they connect and have an obvious need for one another, which causes the people around them to gossip, threat and make efforts to destroy them. Coleman Silk has one of the better lines in the film, in order to justify this relationship:""She's not my first love, nor my greatest love, but she's my last love.""This film is about many things: the evil of prejudice and racism; the ignorance, hypocrisy and oppression of censorship; the mysteries of attraction and love between people; it is about fear and our need for revenge; it is about making choices and having to live with those choices.This is a special film and a wonderful story, intriguing and confronting but ultimately a tragedy in every sense.",5,A special though tragic film,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",2005,3182,"['Based', 'novel', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'special', 'film', 'exploring', 'issues', 'race', 'hypocrisy', 'relationships', 'tragedy', 'human', 'condition.Coleman', 'Silk', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'classics', 'professor', 'eastern', 'Ivy', 'League', 'college', 'tenure', 'Dean', 'school', 'brought', 'college', 'mediocre', 'one', 'one', 'excellence', 'politics', 'academia', 'where', 'bureaucracy', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'entrenched', 'change', 'enemy', 'thus', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'efforts', 'towards', 'excellence', 'inevitably', 'few', 'late', 'nineties', 'Clinton', 'administration', 'atmosphere', 'so-called', 'political', 'correctness', 'hovered', 'spectre', 'censorship', 'reigned', 'supreme', 'one', 'characters', 'end', 'film', 'states', 'People', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'dumb', 'have', 'opinion', 'Professor', 'Silk', 'mistake', 'calling', 'two', 'conspicuously', 'absent', 'students', 'spooks', 'definitive', 'context', 'absence', 'invisibility', 'not', '50', 'slang', 'black', 'American', 'fact', 'never', 'met', 'students', 'words', 'are', 'taken', 'racial', 'slurs', 'students', 'are', 'black', 'Americans', 'be', 'great', 'irony', 'film', 'interesting', 'example', 'censorship', 'time', 'so', 'many', 'cases', 'person', 'people', 'crying', 'racism', 'explicit', 'sex', 'whatever', 'issue', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'taken', 'context', 'turning', 'something', 'other', 'what', 'actually', 'principle', 'because', 'fear', 'one', 'forced', 'resign', 'just', 'retirement', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'Silk', 'wife', 'arms', 'heart', 'attack', 'very', 'day.Enter', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'Gary', 'Siniese', 'writer', 'hiding', 'narrator', 'tale', 'two', 'men', 'forge', 'bond', 'interesting', 'touching', 'scene', 'where', 'dance', 'cheek', 'cheek', 'porch', 'sentimental', 'song', 'was', 'work', 'pure', 'theatrical', 'genius', 'question', 'fine', 'actors', 'are', 'top', 'art', 'form', 'here', 'Silk', 'involved', 'thirty-four', 'year', 'old', 'woman', 'Enter', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'beautiful', 'working', 'class', 'girl', 'legion', 'personal', 'issues', 'sexually', 'abused', 'child', 'battered', 'wife', 'psychotic', 'husband', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'two', 'dead', 'children', 'due', 'accident', 'explained', 'film', 'vague', 'relationship', 'Silk', 'Farley', 'unusual', 'one', 'vast', 'age', 'difference', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'socially', 'otherwise', 'connect', 'have', 'obvious', 'need', 'one', 'people', 'gossip', 'threat', 'make', 'efforts', 'destroy', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'one', 'better', 'lines', 'film', 'order', 'justify', 'relationship', 'not', 'first', 'love', 'greatest', 'love', 'last', 'love', 'film', 'about', 'many', 'things', 'evil', 'prejudice', 'racism', 'ignorance', 'hypocrisy', 'oppression', 'censorship', 'mysteries', 'attraction', 'love', 'people', 'fear', 'need', 'revenge', 'making', 'choices', 'having', 'live', 'choices.This', 'special', 'film', 'wonderful', 'story', 'intriguing', 'confronting', 'ultimately', 'tragedy', 'sense']",The Human Stain

Just the looks on his face alone are fascinating in this film. Kidman is interesting, too, with my only complaint being her overuse of the f-word. Ninety percent of them in this movie come from her. Gary Sinise is the nice-guy friend who narrates the film.This is a deep human-interest story of a black man who winds up - in an earlier era - posing as a white man so he can have a better chance at a successful career. In the process, he sacrifices his roots, his family and siblings, which comes back to haunt him. He's also a victim, ironically, of political correctness on the subject of race. Wow, it's unusual - and refreshing - to see how PC can run amok and hurt well-meaning people, as demonstrated in this story.Going into further details might spoil the rest of it, so I'll end here.

I'd rate every Roth book since ""The Counterlife"" as a 4 or 5 - ""The Human Stain"" would rate a 5, although it's not Roth's all-time best or his recent best (of the recent Zuckerman books, I thought ""American Pastoral"" was the best).  So, knowing the complexity of the Roth's books, I was amazed to hear that ""The Human Stain"" was being made into a movie, and naturally I rushed out to see the end product.For someone who has read and enjoyed ""The Human Stain"", I think the movie is reasonably good, primarily because it brings back impressions from reading the book.  However, if you haven't read the book, I think that the movie is going to come across as overly complicated, jumbled mess, which obscures the many messages Roth is able to communicate in the book.""The Human Stain"" is a very complex story with many disparate elements: current political scandals, coming of age, World War II, boxing, familial relationships, academic politics, race relations, political correctness and modern-day witch hunts, life in the underclass, abusive relationships, homosexuality, and multiple deaths and love affairs.  Any two or three of these elements could easily fill up a two hour movie.  Surprisingly, the moviemakers chose to bring almost all of these elements into the movie, in an attempt to be faithful.  However, without hundreds of pages and hours of the reader's attention, and without Roth's genius to tie it all together and add meaning, I don't think it works as a stand-alone movie.There is one excellent acting performance in the film:  Ed Harris is almost as riveting playing psychotic Vietnam vet Lester as Anthony Hopkins was playing Hannibal Lecter.  Casting this film is indeed a nearly impossible task.  I was able to suspend some disbelief to appreciate Anthony Hopkins as Coleman Silk, but it is true that the actor who plays the young Coleman Silk (who is actually closer to Silk's racial profile) doesn't look anything like Anthony Hopkins.  The worst casting was Gary Sinise as Roth's alter ego Nathan Zuckerman.  Sinise is way too young to play an impotent Jewish writer in his twilight years.What recent Philip Roth book would make the best movie?  I think ""Operation Shylock"":  it has the most straightforward plot whose central element (Roth's double identity) could easily transfer to the screen, and there is even a decent amount of action and suspense.  I don't know why the producers chose to film ""The Human Stain"" - it presents a much greater challenge for them and audience members who haven't read the book.",4,"Revives memories if you&#65533;ve read the book; otherwise, beware",1068163200,"11 7, 2003",2003,2792,"['4', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'otherwise', '2', 'stars.Background', 'review', 'am', 'big', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'fan', 'got', 'hooked', 'reading', 'Counterlife', 'absolute', 'masterpiece', 'believe', 'be', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'living', 'writers', ""'d"", 'rate', 'Roth', 'book', 'Counterlife', '4', '5', 'Human', 'Stain', 'would', 'rate', '5', 'not', 'Roth', 'all-time', 'best', 'recent', 'best', 'recent', 'Zuckerman', 'books', 'thought', 'American', 'Pastoral', 'was', 'best', 'So', 'knowing', 'complexity', 'Roth', 'books', 'was', 'amazed', 'hear', 'Human', 'Stain', 'was', 'being', 'made', 'movie', 'naturally', 'rushed', 'out', 'see', 'end', 'product.For', 'someone', 'who', 'read', 'enjoyed', 'Human', 'Stain', 'think', 'movie', 'reasonably', 'good', 'primarily', 'back', 'impressions', 'reading', 'book', 'However', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'think', 'movie', 'going', 'come', 'overly', 'complicated', 'jumbled', 'mess', 'many', 'messages', 'Roth', 'able', 'communicate', 'book', 'Human', 'Stain', 'very', 'complex', 'story', 'many', 'disparate', 'elements', 'current', 'political', 'scandals', 'coming', 'age', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'boxing', 'familial', 'relationships', 'academic', 'politics', 'race', 'relations', 'political', 'correctness', 'modern-day', 'witch', 'hunts', 'life', 'underclass', 'abusive', 'relationships', 'homosexuality', 'multiple', 'deaths', 'love', 'affairs', 'two', 'three', 'elements', 'could', 'easily', 'fill', 'up', 'two', 'hour', 'movie', 'Surprisingly', 'moviemakers', 'chose', 'bring', 'almost', 'elements', 'movie', 'attempt', 'be', 'faithful', 'However', 'hundreds', 'pages', 'hours', 'reader', 'attention', 'Roth', 'genius', 'tie', 'together', 'add', 'meaning', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'stand-alone', 'movie.There', 'one', 'excellent', 'acting', 'performance', 'film', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'almost', 'riveting', 'playing', 'psychotic', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'Lester', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'playing', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Casting', 'film', 'indeed', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'task', 'was', 'able', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'appreciate', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'true', 'actor', 'who', 'young', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'who', 'actually', 'closer', 'Silk', 'racial', 'profile', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'worst', 'casting', 'was', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Roth', 'alter', 'ego', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'Sinise', 'way', 'too', 'young', 'play', 'impotent', 'Jewish', 'writer', 'twilight', 'years.What', 'recent', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'book', 'would', 'make', 'best', 'movie', 'think', 'Operation', 'Shylock', 'most', 'straightforward', 'plot', 'central', 'element', 'Roth', 'double', 'identity', 'could', 'easily', 'transfer', 'screen', 'even', 'decent', 'amount', 'action', 'suspense', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'producers', 'chose', 'film', 'Human', 'Stain', 'much', 'greater', 'challenge', 'audience', 'members', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book']",The Human Stain

She was bored to tears and felt that the premise was unbelievably stupid.  Little did she know, I completely agreed I just have this thing about only seeing part of a movie.  I had to finish it, even if I knew I was gonna hate it.  To me the idea that Anthony Hopkins could be a black man is so unbelievable that I couldn't even begin to concentrate on the meat of the film.  I understand that the novel is acclaimed and everything, and everyone, even critics feel that this film is loyal to that novel, but if that's the case then the novel can't be that great.  If they had chosen another actor I could have believed it maybe, I mean, I have light skinned black friends and I know they could pass for white, but when they tell you their black you can see the features...Anthony Hopkins is whiter than I am...and there's no way I could pass for black so Hopkins is out.  Really if it weren't for the excellent acting on the parts of Hopkins, Kidman and Harris this movie would have no redeeming qualities.  So here you have it, young black man looks white, realizes it's easier to just play white then be who you are, he disowns his family to live his life easy, he becomes a teacher and now in his 70's he's accused of being racist by the people who think he's white so he starts an affair with a much younger woman whos drunk husband wants to kill them both, and he does, and then his secret is exposed to this guy who wants to write a book about him.  I just had such a hard time getting over the idea that some idiot thought Anthony Hopkins could be black that I can't even see this movie for the good that it is.  I'm sorry; this review is probably so tainted it's not even funny.  For all I know this is a great movie, I mean even the premise is something I would normally really enjoy it's just so hard to get over...I'm rambling...never mind.

816406,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B0001XAPX8,David R. Eastwood,"[2, 2]","Everyone who has seen the film LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remembers how it opens with the death of T. E. Lawrence (Peter O'Toole): he drives his motorcycle off a gravel road to avoid hitting some pedestrians. Similarly, THE HUMAN STAIN begins with the deaths of Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) and his lover, Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman): Silk drives his car off an icy road to avoid hitting an approaching pickup truck that deliberately swerved into their lane. About 98% of the subsequent parts of both films are giant flashbacks showing us the significant life-choices Lawrence and Silk made and the things they said and did BEFORE that fatal moment.One of these films is an affirmation, with a kind of summing up; the other is a catalyst or trigger for further thought. In the case of Lawrence, the many remaining scenes arouse our respect and admiration for a heroic historical individual. In that of Silk, we are meant to feel sorrow and compassion for a man with a hidden past--and similar feelings for his lover and for her ex-husband and for almost everyone else in this film--and THEN we are meant to generalize and begin to think about the many flaws in human nature and human society that cause so much suffering for ourselves and for the people we live among: anti-Semitism, racism, classism, ageism, snobbishness, racism, jealousy, hypocricy, cowardice, greed, distrust, racism, selfishness, sexism, puritanism, etc. etc. etc. And did I mention racism yet?Other reviewers have complained that THE HUMAN STAIN leaves out too many parts of Philip Roth's wonderful novel, that Hopkins has a Welsh accent (would Jeff Bridges have done better?), that the actor playing Silk as a younger man (Wentworth Miller) doesn't look or sound like Hopkins, that the love relationship between Silk and Faunia (who is half his age) is ""creepy,"" etc. etc. etc. For those reviewers, this film did not work; something got in the way. I am pretty certain, too, that for my late parents and for my late sister (as well as a few dozen ex-in-laws), this film would not have worked either--chiefly because of their blatant, lamentable RACISM (which many reviewers avoid discussing). One of the huge ironies of THE HUMAN STAIN is that if Silk's secret had been known to any of his fellow faculty members or townspeople, he would have been hated--and probably murdered--because of that, rather than for his (imaginary) Jewishness or for the May-December aspect of his love affair--with an uneducated ""white trash cleaning lady."" (By the way, Coleman Silk's fatal relationship with Faunia Farley is bracketed for us in the movie as being somewhere between Pres. Clinton's obsession with Ms. Lewinsky and that of Achilles with Briseis, the slave girl that Agamemnon coveted in THE ILIAD.)While I was fully conscious of the differences between Miller's and Hopkins' portrayals of Silk, this did not bother me. I thought both actors did fine jobs with their scenes, as did Nicole Kidman (she is especially wonderful when talking with the captive crow!) and Gary Sinise (playing Nathan Zuckerman, who, at the end, is writing about Silk--and who perhaps has been, in a kind of loop, presenting us Silk's story all along, including how Silk met him). Phyllis Newman (an actress I admired forty years ago) does an excellent brief scene as Silk's wife, Iris, who suffers a fatal heart attack when he is falsely accused of being a racist, and Ed Harris is totally believable and totally wonderful as Lester Farley, Kidman's jealous, half-crazy, Vietnam-vet ex-husband (this is the best performance I have ever seen Harris give). Kudos also to Mimi Kuzyk as ambitious Prof. Delphine Roux, who viciously accuses Silk of being a racist.Do the five stars I gave this film mean I think it is nearly perfect? No--if I were giving it a letter grade, I would rate it about A- (somewhere around a 92 perhaps). Why this high? Because despite its flaws, it DID work for me: it made me feel strongly and care strongly about the characters and their problems and the outcomes of their lives--and it made me continue to ponder them and the broader issues the film raised, not just for a few seconds or minutes or hours, but for several days after watching it. Not many films have had that strong an impact on me. THE MISSION did, and so did A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (both with screenplays by Robert Bolt, who coincidentally also wrote the screenplay for LAWRENCE OF ARABIA). But not many other films have had this effect--so THE HUMAN STAIN is in very good company.",5,"AN IMPORTANT FILM, WORTH REPEATED VIEWINGS",1254096000,"09 28, 2009",2009,4516,"['Everyone', 'who', 'seen', 'film', 'LAWRENCE', 'OF', 'ARABIA', 'how', 'death', 'T.', 'E.', 'Lawrence', 'Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'motorcycle', 'gravel', 'road', 'avoid', 'hitting', 'pedestrians', 'Similarly', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'deaths', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'lover', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Silk', 'car', 'off', 'icy', 'road', 'avoid', 'hitting', 'approaching', 'pickup', 'truck', 'deliberately', 'swerved', 'lane', '98', '%', 'subsequent', 'parts', 'films', 'are', 'giant', 'flashbacks', 'showing', 'significant', 'life-choices', 'Lawrence', 'Silk', 'made', 'things', 'said', 'did', 'fatal', 'moment.One', 'films', 'affirmation', 'kind', 'summing', 'up', 'other', 'catalyst', 'trigger', 'further', 'thought', 'case', 'Lawrence', 'many', 'remaining', 'scenes', 'respect', 'admiration', 'heroic', 'historical', 'individual', 'Silk', 'are', 'meant', 'feel', 'sorrow', 'compassion', 'man', 'hidden', 'past', 'similar', 'feelings', 'lover', 'ex-husband', 'almost', 'everyone', 'else', 'film', 'are', 'meant', 'generalize', 'begin', 'think', 'many', 'flaws', 'human', 'nature', 'human', 'society', 'cause', 'so', 'much', 'suffering', 'ourselves', 'people', 'live', 'anti-Semitism', 'racism', 'classism', 'ageism', 'snobbishness', 'racism', 'jealousy', 'hypocricy', 'cowardice', 'greed', 'distrust', 'racism', 'selfishness', 'sexism', 'puritanism', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'did', 'mention', 'racism', 'yet', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'complained', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'out', 'too', 'many', 'parts', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'wonderful', 'novel', 'Hopkins', 'Welsh', 'accent', 'would', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'actor', 'playing', 'Silk', 'younger', 'man', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', ""n't"", 'look', 'sound', 'Hopkins', 'love', 'relationship', 'Silk', 'Faunia', 'who', 'age', 'creepy', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'reviewers', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'something', 'got', 'way', 'am', 'pretty', 'certain', 'too', 'late', 'parents', 'late', 'sister', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'dozen', 'ex-in-laws', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'chiefly', 'blatant', 'lamentable', 'RACISM', 'many', 'reviewers', 'avoid', 'discussing', 'One', 'huge', 'ironies', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'Silk', 'secret', 'had', 'been', 'known', 'fellow', 'faculty', 'members', 'townspeople', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'hated', 'probably', 'murdered', 'rather', 'imaginary', 'Jewishness', 'May-December', 'aspect', 'love', 'affair', 'uneducated', 'white', 'trash', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'way', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'fatal', 'relationship', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'bracketed', 'movie', 'being', 'somewhere', 'Pres', 'Clinton', 'obsession', 'Ms.', 'Lewinsky', 'Achilles', 'Briseis', 'slave', 'girl', 'Agamemnon', 'coveted', 'THE', 'ILIAD', 'was', 'fully', 'conscious', 'differences', 'Miller', 'Hopkins', 'portrayals', 'Silk', 'did', 'not', 'bother', 'thought', 'actors', 'did', 'fine', 'jobs', 'scenes', 'did', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'when', 'talking', 'captive', 'crow', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'playing', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'who', 'end', 'writing', 'Silk', 'who', 'perhaps', 'been', 'kind', 'loop', 'presenting', 'Silk', 'story', 'all', 'along', 'including', 'how', 'Silk', 'met', 'Phyllis', 'Newman', 'actress', 'admired', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'excellent', 'brief', 'scene', 'Silk', 'wife', 'Iris', 'who', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'when', 'falsely', 'accused', 'being', 'racist', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'totally', 'believable', 'totally', 'wonderful', 'Lester', 'Farley', 'Kidman', 'jealous', 'half-crazy', 'Vietnam-vet', 'ex-husband', 'best', 'performance', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Harris', 'give', 'Kudos', 'also', 'Mimi', 'Kuzyk', 'ambitious', 'Prof.', 'Delphine', 'Roux', 'who', 'viciously', 'Silk', 'being', 'racist.Do', 'five', 'stars', 'gave', 'film', 'mean', 'think', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'were', 'giving', 'letter', 'grade', 'would', 'rate', 'A-', 'somewhere', '92', 'perhaps', 'Why', 'high', 'flaws', 'DID', 'work', 'made', 'feel', 'strongly', 'care', 'strongly', 'characters', 'problems', 'outcomes', 'lives', 'made', 'continue', 'ponder', 'broader', 'issues', 'film', 'raised', 'not', 'just', 'few', 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', 'several', 'days', 'watching', 'Not', 'many', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'strong', 'impact', 'MISSION', 'did', 'so', 'did', 'MAN', 'ALL', 'SEASONS', 'screenplays', 'Robert', 'Bolt', 'who', 'coincidentally', 'also', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'LAWRENCE', 'OF', 'ARABIA', 'not', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'effect', 'THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'very', 'good', 'company']",The Human Stain

The story itself is meaningful and its overall arrangement is captivating, but more running time could have been employed to deepen the plot's moving power.Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) was accused of racial discrimination because he referred to his two African American students as ""spooks"" since they were absent from the class. After experiencing disastrous losses at this late stage of his life, he befriended the writer, Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise) and was involved with a working-class woman Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman) who was much younger than he was. Dark, tragic pasts, including the intrusions of her ex-husband (Ed Harris), kept plaguing Faunia. Thus, people around Coleman Silk had been persuading him out of romanizing with Faunia. However, their suggestions went on deaf years, for Faunia reminded Silk of his youthful love and was almost a salvation for him to purity his deep-rooted anguish.The performances from the actors and actresses are all extraordinary. Hopkins, although too ""white"" to play Silk, was convincingly the man with simmering pain, presented by his subdued expressions. Kidman did an equally good job despite her extreme motions now and then. Moreover, the unknown young performers who play young Silk and his lover are remarkable, too, whose vividly delivery of two people confined by their ethnic biases really shine.""The Human Stain"" serves as a stark irony of a person not identifying with his own pedigree.

816408,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0001XAPX8,Dennis Littrell,"[4, 4]","Classics Professor Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), exasperated that two students have yet to show up for his class points to their empty seats and ask rhetorically, ""Do they exist or are they spooks?""  He should have chosen his words more carefully because the two absent students are black and Silk is subsequently charged with using racial slurs by the college.Yes, this could definitely happen, although one would expect it to be cleared up once there was an investigation.  However, Coleman Silk gets more than a little uptight.  Something has hit a nerve.  He has enemies.  He doesn't cooperate and in fact resigns in face of the charge.  His wife drops dead, and at the age of 71 Coleman gets involved in a Viagra-hyped love affair with Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), a 34-year-old cleaning woman and high school dropout with a past.Turns out that Coleman too has a past, and that past partially explains why he got so uptight about the racial slur charge.  Seems that Coleman has ""passed.""  Seems that he was ""colored"" and didn't want to be colored and so forsook his family and passed into the white world and never looked back.This is from the novel by Philip Roth, who has written many splendid novels.  The adaptation is by Nicholas Meyer who did most of the scripts for the Star Trek movies.  Robert Benton's direction is professional and clear.  Anthony Hopkins is very good as one would expect and Nicole Kidman as a hardtack brunette with worry lines on her face is vividly real as the bitter, but vulnerable Faunia Farley.  Ed Harris plays her also bitter, spaced-out, estranged husband, a twisted Viet Vet with malevolence on his mind.The story is told in a straight-forward way with flashbacks to Coleman's past where we see that he was a welterweight prize fighter for a while and had his heart broken because his very blonde bride-to-be just couldn't stomach the thought of marrying into a Negro family.  Wentworth Miller plays young Coleman and definitely looks and acts the part.

816411,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B0001XAPX8,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[5, 6]","...I had the feeling that this film pretty much lost sight of the woods for the trees.  It begins with Achilles' dilemma in The Iliad with a slave girl which his king also covets, then quickly moves to the excesses of political correctness in academia, then to American sexual hypocrisy and sanctimony in the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, to a Viagra-assisted, sixty-something sudden-widower who suddenly lands a vivacious thirty-something woman from a very different social and economic class background with a very checkered past, her Vietnam-scarred psychopathic ex-husband who stalks her, the dramatic reinvigoration and sexual reawakening in such a winter-spring relationship, to the deeply ingrained racism in American society as experienced by a mulatto boy who decides to pass himself as Jewish and breaks ties with his family.All this might be gracefully contained in a 400-page novel (maybe...I haven't read Roth's book yet) but crammed into a 2-hour movie, it all feels a bit disjointed.While Kidman, Hopkins, Harris and Sinese are all a bit miscast in their roles, all three put in solid performances...Kidman has never looked more appealing and real, in contrast to her usual generic-blonde look.  Hopkins isn't quite up to the anguish and explosive rage that his character is supposed to express in a few of the scenes---he simply doesn't have the range for it---but is otherwise competent. The film is beautifully shot, with a very effective score, and technically superb.What's missing though is any kind of overarching theme or point to tie everything together.  I suppose we could deduce one from the title: ""The Human Stain"" as a rather misanthropic treatise on the abject depths to which humanity constantly sinks?  It's possible but there is no strong impetus to be found in the movie, which ends with Harris and Sinese conversing upon a frozen lake.

816413,A1655SGPPUUCRP,B0001XAPX8,Emily Todd,"[13, 18]","Robert Benton's ""The Human Stain"" is a well-intentioned, ambitious but ultimately deeply flawed film.  It does a masterful job of passing for a profound, Oscar-caliber film.  So masterful, in fact, that for long stretches of time you don't notice that it's simply not working.It boasts an incredible A-list cast including Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise and Ed Harris, it does indeed boast some Oscar-worthy performances.  I was especially impressed by Kidman's complete transformation into a somewhat-less-than-classy janitor.  In addition to the tour-de-force cast, there's Benton's artsy direction style and the even-artsier cinematographer Jean-Yves Escoffier's beautiful work.  Escoffier died shortly after filming wrapped and the film is dedicated in his memory.  And thene there's the esteemed Rachel Portman's beautifully composed score.  And then there's the source material which was adapted from the brilliantly complex novel by Philip Roth.However, these glittering pieces never fit together into a movie that's worthy of its prestigious pedigree.  It seems unfair, then, that all of that talent and expertise has resulted in a film that, while beautifully crafted, is so emotionally detached, remote, and confused by itself.  I haven't read Roth's novel, but I suspect that screenwriter Nicholas Meyer, in his attempt to get all the main characters and events from the book onto the screen, had to leave a lot of connective material behind. That material, whatever it may be, may have seemed less important to Meyer, but without it the parts of Roth's story just drift, disconnected, in their own peculiar orbits.Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a college professor who loses his job over a supposedly racist remark.  The irony of this charge forms the base theme for the story. Silk's comment is innocent because of ""the big secret"" he has hidden for many years.  After resigning from the college where he had worked for years, he begins an affair with Faunia Farley, played by Kidman.  She has her own emotional baggage and is unable to commit to the relationship with Coleman.  The affair, however, revitalizes Silk and he is finally able to confront some of his past demons.Just about the time all these conflicts are coming to a head, the whole story comes to a crashing halt. There is an extended epilogue. The movie staggers on for about 20 more minutes, but the story has been decapitated, and has nowhere to go. The ending is anti-climactic in the most extreme sense of the word.The storyline is periodically (and annoyingly) interrupted by extended flashbacks of Coleman as a young man in 1944 New York.  It's in these scenes that we learn ""the big secret"" that Coleman has spent his life concealing.  This is the hidden core of the film.  And it ends up being the ultimate failing of the film. The flashbacks work fine on their own merits, but they don't feel connected at all to the rest of the film. The flashback scenes, and the secret they contain, seem to have no impact on the later scenes. If somebody told me that Hopkins was never even told by Benton what went on in the flashblacks, I wouldn't be a bit surprised.Kidman, meanwhile, takes a good many risks, playing not just seductive but lowbrow to considerable effect; her character, however, is never fully explored, and a few of her scenes are bizarrely unexplained (especially one in which she talks to a caged crow in a campus classroom, which comes out of nowhere and makes very little sense).",2,"""How far would you go to escape the past?""",1108512000,"02 16, 2005",2005,3490,"['Robert', 'Benton', 'Human', 'Stain', 'well-intentioned', 'ambitious', 'ultimately', 'deeply', 'flawed', 'film', 'masterful', 'job', 'passing', 'profound', 'Oscar-caliber', 'film', 'So', 'masterful', 'fact', 'long', 'stretches', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'notice', 'simply', 'not', 'working.It', 'incredible', 'A-list', 'cast', 'including', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'indeed', 'boast', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performances', 'was', 'especially', 'impressed', 'Kidman', 'complete', 'transformation', 'somewhat-less-than-classy', 'janitor', 'addition', 'tour-de-force', 'cast', 'Benton', 'artsy', 'direction', 'style', 'even-artsier', 'cinematographer', 'Jean-Yves', 'Escoffier', 'beautiful', 'work', 'Escoffier', 'died', 'shortly', 'filming', 'wrapped', 'film', 'dedicated', 'memory', 'esteemed', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'beautifully', 'composed', 'score', 'then', 'source', 'material', 'was', 'adapted', 'brilliantly', 'complex', 'novel', 'Philip', 'Roth.However', 'glittering', 'pieces', 'never', 'fit', 'together', 'movie', 'worthy', 'prestigious', 'pedigree', 'unfair', 'then', 'talent', 'expertise', 'resulted', 'film', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'so', 'emotionally', 'detached', 'remote', 'confused', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Roth', 'novel', 'suspect', 'screenwriter', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'attempt', 'get', 'main', 'characters', 'events', 'book', 'screen', 'had', 'leave', 'lot', 'connective', 'material', 'behind', 'material', 'whatever', 'may', 'be', 'may', 'have', 'seemed', 'less', 'important', 'Meyer', 'parts', 'Roth', 'story', 'just', 'drift', 'disconnected', 'own', 'peculiar', 'orbits.Hopkins', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'job', 'supposedly', 'racist', 'remark', 'irony', 'charge', 'base', 'theme', 'story', 'Silk', 'comment', 'innocent', 'big', 'secret', 'hidden', 'many', 'years', 'resigning', 'college', 'where', 'had', 'worked', 'years', 'affair', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'played', 'Kidman', 'own', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'unable', 'commit', 'relationship', 'Coleman', 'affair', 'however', 'Silk', 'finally', 'able', 'confront', 'past', 'demons.Just', 'time', 'conflicts', 'are', 'coming', 'head', 'whole', 'story', 'crashing', 'halt', 'extended', 'epilogue', 'movie', 'staggers', '20', 'more', 'minutes', 'story', 'been', 'decapitated', 'nowhere', 'go', 'ending', 'anti-climactic', 'most', 'extreme', 'sense', 'word.The', 'storyline', 'periodically', 'annoyingly', 'interrupted', 'extended', 'flashbacks', 'Coleman', 'young', 'man', '1944', 'New', 'York', 'scenes', 'learn', 'big', 'secret', 'Coleman', 'spent', 'life', 'concealing', 'hidden', 'core', 'film', 'up', 'being', 'ultimate', 'failing', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'work', 'fine', 'own', 'merits', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'connected', 'rest', 'film', 'flashback', 'scenes', 'secret', 'contain', 'seem', 'have', 'impact', 'later', 'scenes', 'somebody', 'told', 'Hopkins', 'was', 'never', 'even', 'told', 'Benton', 'went', 'flashblacks', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'bit', 'surprised.Kidman', 'meanwhile', 'good', 'many', 'risks', 'playing', 'not', 'just', 'seductive', 'lowbrow', 'considerable', 'effect', 'character', 'however', 'never', 'fully', 'explored', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'bizarrely', 'unexplained', 'especially', 'one', 'caged', 'crow', 'campus', 'classroom', 'nowhere', 'very', 'little', 'sense']",The Human Stain

Somehow I imagine that all the characters and their stories unfold in a more graceful way than they do (or can) with the limitations of a film. Nevertheless, the film does manage to convey both the seeming injustice of what happens to Anthony Hopkins' character as he nears the end of his career and the irony of it happening. It reinforces, in much the same way as the more recent House of Sand and Fog adaptation does, how obsessed people are with preserving a front or facade behind which they have lived for so long that they no longer know how to live otherwise, nor how to acknowledge the truth of their circumstances, even if it would save them.Hopkins is predictably good in the role; Gary Sinise is good but somehow superfluous in his role as the narrator of the story; Nicole Kidman is good but somehow still not believable here because she is just too beautiful, too demure. In some ways, she is excellent and fits well in this role as a woman who has left behind a privileged background and gone down a path riddled with so much loss and misfortune and grief that she has deteriorated into the standoffish and icy woman she seems to be. But does she fit the role of cleaning woman and woman who awakens early to milk cows? Almost, but not quite. She did not disappear into this role.

816419,A34UFYMOMMRSMQ,B0001XAPX8,godzilla twain,"[0, 0]","I wasn't sure what to expect with The Human Stain when it arrived. On the one hand, it had probably one of the worst movie titles I've ever heard. On the other hand, it featured some of my favorite actors - Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinese, and Ed Harris. But on the down side the trailers ruined most of the movie. Throw on top of that the fact that it's a dark, depressing character drama and not even the stellar cast could make this movie enjoyable for me.The Human Stain is a really depressing movie. Every character in the film is depressed, tortured, or otherwise put through emotional hell at one point or another. It's a bit intense and not for you if you're looking for some light entertainment.The script is pretty good. The story jumps back and forth in time and features Silk as both a young man and an older man. (I personally found the less star powered tales from his youth to be more interesting.) There is also some pretty good dialogue offered. However, it has some problems. It asks the audience to take some pretty big leaps in believability. First of all, we're asked to believe that Anthony Hopkins is a light skinned black person. (And that secret was ruined in the trailers early on, another bad mark against The Human Stain.) Believing Hopkins is black makes about as much sense as believing he's Hispanic. (Zorro, anyone?) As much as I like Hopkins, someone else should have been cast as Silk. The second big leap in logic is the fact that Silk, a highly educated older professor, would fall for an uneducated, psychologically tortured character like Faunia. I can't see the two falling for each other under many real world circumstances. And any time a character in the film suggests that it has something to do with sex, Silk flies into a rage. Well, seeing as how most of the time they are only shown in bed together, that seems like the only explanation. They certainly don't seem to have any other believable connection. My final gripe on the script is that it repeatedly mentions the Bill Clinton / Monica Lewenski scandal. It seemed to be trying to offer some sort of commentary on the subject, but I never quite figured out what it was. It seemed to be saying that the whole incident was trivial, but I wasn't sure.Despite not being black, Anthony Hopkins does a pretty good job as Coleman Silk. He has no problem portraying the intellectual side of the character. He also doesn't seem to have any problem playing the horny old man side, either. Nicole Kidman goes through an impressive trailer trash transformation as Faunia Farley. Kidman is good at playing the tortured soul and that's what she does here (along with having a surprising number of nude scenes). Ed Harris is also good at playing the psychotic Lester Farley while Gary Sinise plays the straight man and narrator as Nathan Zuckerman. However, I was very much impressed with Wentworth Miller as Young Coleman Silk. He imitated Hopkins fairly well and he's a handsome young actor who I could see taking on larger roles. I found the scenes where he turns his back on his family and race to be the best of the movie.The Human Stain is also a good looking film. The backgrounds and sets are beautiful and the camera flatters all of the actors. A good film score also helps to elevate the film. It's fortunate that The Human Stain had these things going for it along with the excellent cast, because otherwise it would even worse. In the end the excellent cast helps raise the quality up a bit, but not enough to sell me on it.",3,recommended only for to fans of character dramas,1090972800,"07 28, 2004",2004,3534,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'Human', 'Stain', 'when', 'arrived', 'one', 'hand', 'had', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'movie', 'titles', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'other', 'hand', 'featured', 'favorite', 'actors', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'down', 'side', 'trailers', 'ruined', 'most', 'movie', 'Throw', 'top', 'fact', 'dark', 'depressing', 'character', 'drama', 'not', 'even', 'stellar', 'cast', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'me.The', 'Human', 'Stain', 'really', 'depressing', 'movie', 'character', 'film', 'depressed', 'tortured', 'otherwise', 'put', 'emotional', 'hell', 'one', 'point', 'bit', 'intense', 'not', ""'re"", 'looking', 'light', 'entertainment.The', 'script', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'features', 'Silk', 'young', 'man', 'older', 'man', 'personally', 'found', 'less', 'star', 'powered', 'tales', 'youth', 'be', 'more', 'interesting', 'also', 'pretty', 'good', 'dialogue', 'offered', 'However', 'problems', 'audience', 'take', 'pretty', 'big', 'leaps', 'believability', 'First', 'all', ""'re"", 'asked', 'believe', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'light', 'skinned', 'black', 'person', 'secret', 'was', 'ruined', 'trailers', 'early', 'bad', 'mark', 'Human', 'Stain', 'Believing', 'Hopkins', 'black', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'sense', 'believing', 'Hispanic', 'Zorro', 'anyone', 'As', 'much', 'like', 'Hopkins', 'someone', 'else', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'Silk', 'second', 'big', 'leap', 'logic', 'fact', 'Silk', 'highly', 'educated', 'older', 'professor', 'would', 'fall', 'uneducated', 'psychologically', 'tortured', 'character', 'Faunia', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'two', 'falling', 'other', 'many', 'real', 'world', 'circumstances', 'time', 'character', 'film', 'something', 'do', 'sex', 'Silk', 'rage', 'Well', 'seeing', 'how', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'bed', 'together', 'only', 'explanation', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'other', 'believable', 'connection', 'final', 'gripe', 'script', 'repeatedly', 'Bill', 'Clinton', '/', 'Monica', 'Lewenski', 'scandal', 'seemed', 'be', 'trying', 'offer', 'sort', 'commentary', 'subject', 'never', 'quite', 'figured', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'seemed', 'be', 'saying', 'whole', 'incident', 'was', 'trivial', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure.Despite', 'not', 'being', 'black', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'problem', 'portraying', 'intellectual', 'side', 'character', 'also', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'problem', 'playing', 'horny', 'old', 'man', 'side', 'either', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'impressive', 'trailer', 'trash', 'transformation', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'Kidman', 'good', 'playing', 'tortured', 'soul', 'what', 'here', 'having', 'surprising', 'number', 'nude', 'scenes', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'also', 'good', 'playing', 'psychotic', 'Lester', 'Farley', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'straight', 'man', 'narrator', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'However', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'impressed', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'Young', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'imitated', 'Hopkins', 'fairly', 'well', 'handsome', 'young', 'actor', 'who', 'could', 'see', 'taking', 'larger', 'roles', 'found', 'scenes', 'where', 'back', 'family', 'race', 'be', 'best', 'movie.The', 'Human', 'Stain', 'also', 'good', 'looking', 'film', 'backgrounds', 'sets', 'are', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'actors', 'good', 'film', 'score', 'also', 'elevate', 'film', 'fortunate', 'Human', 'Stain', 'had', 'things', 'going', 'excellent', 'cast', 'would', 'even', 'worse', 'end', 'excellent', 'cast', 'raise', 'quality', 'up', 'bit', 'not', 'enough', 'sell']",The Human Stain
816420,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001XAPX8,Grady Harp,"[0, 0]","THE HUMAN STAIN met a mixed reaction when released in the theatres, possibly because the issues, which imbue this film with particular significance, got lost on the large screen that by nature concentrates on the BIG effect.  But on the DVD, viewed in the privacy of the home, the degrees of subtleties are more pronounced.  The indelible stain that birthright makes on our lives is examined in many facets in this adaptation of Philip Roth's rather sensational novel by the same name.  What effect does ethnicity have on molding our lives, what effect does the potential that inherited wealth will play on our view of the world, what effect can public prejudice as well as self-induced prejudice have on the way we process our adulthood roles?  This film addresses all of these issues: a Caucasian-appearing African American young man opts for costuming his life as a white Jewish scholar only to be dismissed from his professor's position because of a perceived 'racial slur' against absent black students; a young girl from a broken wealthy family sees through the vacuous existence when molested by a stepfather and runs into a life of poverty and personal tragedy desperately needing affection; a young writer becomes a recluse after the success of a first novel out of fear of flying; a visceral man enters madness induced by self-imposed exile.  Characters such as these put great demands on actors and it is very much to the credit of the screenwriter Nicholas Meyer and  director Robert Benton that the services of Sir Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Wentworth Miller, Anna Deavere Smith along with a fine supporting cast were captured to bring pulsating life to this difficult intermixing of stories.

816423,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B0001XAPX8,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 5]","This film is more than disquieting; It is disturbing. An older senior professor is fired (he resigns but that is the same) when confronted to some accusation of misconduct because he asked one day if two students he was trying to question and who had never come to his class were spooks. The two students were black, which he could not know. At the beginning we see a car accident and we will see the same scene at the end and we will know who were in the car and we will have to guess what happened. In the meantime we find out that this older man falls in love with a younger woman, twice younger than he is, in her early thirties. That love affair does not work properly and yet it is an unbreakable love affair. But the woman is divorced, slightly unstable and her ex-husband is completely berserk and he is suffering of the trauma of Vietnam veterans who cannot get over the obsessive compulsive disorder of theirs that make them do strange things without any reason or conscience. Those are for sure spooks and they may spook the hell out of you. Since he was present on the final death scene, we can imagine the reaction of the ex-professor when he saw the red truck on the deep snow on the road in the mountains. But that's the easy way. Shortly after his being fired and his wife dying of a heart attack in his arms because of it he goes and meets an author who has completely retired in the mountain and they both fall not in love but in complete friendship. We have then two cases of an old man in love with a younger woman and in friendship with a younger man. I think the second case is dealt with more realism. Such a friendship is direct, often brutal in tone and content but absolute in trust and unbreakable. Such a friendship is like a buoy for a drowning old man and a tremendous discovery for the younger man if he is curious and accepts the bond, because it is a bond. Of course there is no erotic dimension to that. The two become soul brothers and enjoy every moment and every hard word of this experience because it is their deepest soul and mind that are in love and this love or friendship becomes for both a kind of life line with the infinite. It is different with the woman because it is sexual and you do not need to be a great lawyer to fear some pregnancy problem or some fatherhood questioning eventually. The love between the two is not depicted with any tenderness. It is rather violent and rather uniquely centered on love thanks to Viagra. All that is the surface of the problem depicted on, the film. Some flashbacks reveal little by little that this professor who is known as white and Jewish is of a quite different origin and that is the very and deepest meaning of the ""spook"" remark. It is deeply racist but racist against himself and his choice to become a Jew is another sign of his racism by affiliating himself to a minority group that is hated by so many people in the world so that he will be hated by many. And then we can see the final death scene again and we can wonder if it is not a suicide. We can wonder or be sure, depending on the level of consciousness we have that racism is a stain deep in the mind, the soul and the spirit of a man, a stain he can only get rid of by killing himself, and in that case along with the younger woman he is supposed to love and is asleep next to him, as if he were afraid to go away alone. It is true when you lose the first girl you love because you take her to your family and she discovers they are not as white as she is and as her boyfriend, their son, is, there is like a long simmering desire to kill, at least to kill oneself because of this injustice, unfairness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",5,Self-racism leads to suicide,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",2010,3798,"['film', 'more', 'disquieting', 'disturbing', 'older', 'senior', 'professor', 'fired', 'same', 'when', 'confronted', 'accusation', 'misconduct', 'asked', 'one', 'day', 'two', 'students', 'was', 'trying', 'question', 'who', 'had', 'never', 'come', 'class', 'were', 'spooks', 'two', 'students', 'were', 'black', 'could', 'not', 'know', 'beginning', 'see', 'car', 'accident', 'will', 'see', 'same', 'scene', 'end', 'will', 'know', 'who', 'were', 'car', 'will', 'have', 'guess', 'what', 'happened', 'meantime', 'find', 'out', 'older', 'man', 'love', 'younger', 'woman', 'twice', 'younger', 'early', 'thirties', 'love', 'affair', 'not', 'work', 'properly', 'yet', 'unbreakable', 'love', 'affair', 'woman', 'divorced', 'slightly', 'unstable', 'ex-husband', 'completely', 'berserk', 'suffering', 'trauma', 'Vietnam', 'veterans', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'obsessive', 'compulsive', 'disorder', 'theirs', 'make', 'do', 'strange', 'things', 'reason', 'conscience', 'are', 'sure', 'spooks', 'may', 'spook', 'hell', 'was', 'present', 'final', 'death', 'scene', 'can', 'imagine', 'reaction', 'ex-professor', 'when', 'saw', 'red', 'truck', 'deep', 'snow', 'road', 'mountains', 'easy', 'way', 'Shortly', 'being', 'fired', 'wife', 'dying', 'heart', 'attack', 'arms', 'author', 'who', 'completely', 'retired', 'mountain', 'fall', 'not', 'love', 'complete', 'friendship', 'have', 'then', 'two', 'cases', 'old', 'man', 'love', 'younger', 'woman', 'friendship', 'younger', 'man', 'think', 'second', 'case', 'dealt', 'more', 'realism', 'friendship', 'direct', 'often', 'brutal', 'tone', 'content', 'absolute', 'trust', 'unbreakable', 'friendship', 'buoy', 'drowning', 'old', 'man', 'tremendous', 'discovery', 'younger', 'man', 'curious', 'bond', 'bond', 'course', 'erotic', 'dimension', 'two', 'become', 'soul', 'brothers', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'hard', 'word', 'experience', 'deepest', 'soul', 'mind', 'are', 'love', 'love', 'friendship', 'becomes', 'kind', 'life', 'line', 'infinite', 'different', 'woman', 'sexual', 'do', 'not', 'need', 'be', 'great', 'lawyer', 'fear', 'pregnancy', 'problem', 'fatherhood', 'questioning', 'eventually', 'love', 'two', 'not', 'depicted', 'tenderness', 'rather', 'violent', 'rather', 'uniquely', 'centered', 'love', 'thanks', 'Viagra', 'surface', 'problem', 'depicted', 'film', 'flashbacks', 'reveal', 'little', 'little', 'professor', 'who', 'known', 'white', 'Jewish', 'quite', 'different', 'origin', 'very', 'deepest', 'meaning', 'spook', 'remark', 'deeply', 'racist', 'racist', 'choice', 'become', 'Jew', 'sign', 'racism', 'affiliating', 'minority', 'group', 'hated', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'world', 'so', 'will', 'be', 'hated', 'many', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'final', 'death', 'scene', 'again', 'can', 'wonder', 'not', 'suicide', 'can', 'wonder', 'be', 'sure', 'depending', 'level', 'consciousness', 'have', 'racism', 'stain', 'deep', 'mind', 'soul', 'spirit', 'man', 'stain', 'can', 'only', 'get', 'rid', 'killing', 'case', 'younger', 'woman', 'supposed', 'love', 'asleep', 'next', 'were', 'afraid', 'go', 'away', 'alone', 'true', 'when', 'lose', 'first', 'girl', 'love', 'take', 'family', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'white', 'boyfriend', 'son', 'long', 'simmering', 'desire', 'kill', 'least', 'kill', 'injustice', 'unfairness.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Paris', '8', 'Saint', 'Denis', 'University', 'Paris', '12', 'Cr', 'eacute', 'CEGID']",The Human Stain

816426,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B0001XAPX8,Joe Sherry,"[1, 1]","A film by Robert BentonI was actually looking forward to this movie.  I loved the Philip Roth novel that this movie was based on, and there is some serious acting talent involved.  The director is the same one who made Kramer VS Kramer.  With all of this talent, and all of this promise, the film does not ultimately deliver.This film is narrated (periodically) by Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise).  Zuckerman is a writer who is living in a cabin near Athena College.  He tells us about Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins).  Coleman was the Dean of Athena College.  He retired in the midst of a rather large scandal due to an alleged racial slur he made in a classroom (""are they real, or are they spooks"").  In context, he was asking if two students were ghosts.  Out of context, he asked if two students (who had not attended a single class in 5 weeks) were spooks, and those two students turned out to be black.  Coleman turned to Zuckerman to write the story of this absurd charge.  Zuckerman says that he can't write it, but as Coleman and Zuckerman become friends, we are shown Coleman's life in the past and present.The racist allegation is absurd because Coleman, despite his white skin, is a black man.  His parents are black (though light skinned), his sister and brother are black.  Coleman just happens to have skin so light he can pass as a white man (it's not impossible, a minor white character in the film is actually played by a black man).  We see Coleman's past, and see how he decides to identify himself a white man rather than accept who and what he is.In the present, Coleman has begun an affair with Faunia Farely (Nicole Kidman), a woman 40 years younger than he is.  Coleman's wife had died, and Faunia just seems to want sex and a little companionship.  Coleman feels like a new man (all the while extolling the virtues of Viagra).  The only problem is that Faunia's ex-husband Les (Ed Harris) is still stalking her and is angry and resentful towards both Faunia and Coleman.The movie weaves these two stories together (the past and present), and together it makes up The Human Stain.  While this worked incredibly well in the novel, in the film it seems to be missing something.  The parts are greater than the whole.  The acting in this movie is fantastic.  This may be Ed Harris's best work in several years (despite his recent Academy Award nominations).  Hopkins, Kidman, and Sinise are all solid.  The only failing is in the construction of the movie.  It all fits together, but it doesn't seem to work as well as it should.

816427,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B0001XAPX8,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 7]","Ooooo! THE HUMAN STAIN offers the potential for so many Oscar nominations: Best Picture, Best Actor (Hopkins &amp; Kidman), Best Supporting Actor (Miller, Harris, &amp; Smith).Hopkins is Coleman Silk, an aging and respected professor of literature at an idyllic New England liberal arts college, who, in the &quot;now&quot; of 1998, runs afoul of extremist political correctness. He's accused of racism after referring to two students, who've been absent from his class for the first 5 weeks of the term, as &quot;spooks&quot;, i.e. ghosts. Silk has never met them under any circumstances, but, as bad luck would have it, they're both Black. Called onto the carpet by the Board, and receiving no support from those who should know better, Coleman angrily resigns. When Silk breaks the news to his wife, she suffers a fatal heart attack. As Coleman puts it, his persecutors killed the wrong person.On the rebound, Silk meets Faunia Farely (Kidman), who holds down three blue collar jobs, is separated from her abusive husband, a psychotic Vietnam vet named Lester (Ed Harris), and who keeps the ashes of her two dead kids under the bed. Faunia describes her troubled situation as befitting &quot;trailer trash&quot;, and carries more baggage than a loaded 747. But Silk is besotted, and embarks on a torrid love affair with the 30-year younger woman. As Silk declares to his writer friend Nathan (Gary Sinise):&quot;This is not my first love, it's not my great love, but it's my last love&quot;. It's love - and great sex - in the winter of Coleman's life. Even Viagra gets a verbal plug.THE HUMAN STAIN is also a tale of &quot;racial passing&quot;, i.e. the process  of shifting one's racial identity. You see, Coleman has a secret that he's kept buried for decades. (No, it's not that he's Welsh like Hopkins, but something else.) The film jumps back and forth between 1998 and the late 1940s, when a young Silk (Wentworth Miller) chooses to make the transition and abandon his natural family forever. It's only now, in a last orgasm of sharing with Faunia, that Coleman can unburden himself.The plot sounds like grist for a maudlin TV soap, but is raised to heights of excellence by extraordinary performances, especially Hopkins and Kidman. Hopkins wore green contact lenses to match Miller's eye color, and the two men synchronized speech and body movement characteristics to make the age transition as seamless as possible. Nicole spent time in shelters for abused women to acclimatize herself to aspects of the role. And a scene where she longs to touch the back of Coleman's neck is Oscar material by itself.Perhaps the most poignant sequence involves the young Coleman and his mother (Anna Deavere Smith), when the latter suggests what her birthday present might be five years hence. It brings tears to her son's eyes, and perhaps some of those in the audience. Smith's role is not extensive, but certainly memorable.&quot;Human stain&quot; refers to the indelible mark, however miniscule in the universal scheme of things, that each of us makes on the world and which can't be undone. This film is about Coleman's stain and his coming to terms with it.At one point, Coleman asks Faunia, battered by life and circumstances, what she wants from their relationship. She responds: &quot;kindness&quot;. This is, for each of us perhaps, the greatest truth of all.",5,Love in winter,1070236800,"12 1, 2003",2003,3367,"['Ooooo', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'potential', 'so', 'many', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Hopkins', 'amp', 'Kidman', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Miller', 'Harris', 'amp', 'Smith', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'aging', 'respected', 'professor', 'literature', 'idyllic', 'New', 'England', 'liberal', 'arts', 'college', 'who', 'quot', 'now', 'quot', '1998', 'afoul', 'extremist', 'political', 'correctness', 'accused', 'racism', 'referring', 'two', 'students', 'who', ""'ve"", 'been', 'absent', 'class', 'first', '5', 'weeks', 'term', 'quot', 'quot', 'i.e', 'ghosts', 'Silk', 'never', 'met', 'circumstances', 'bad', 'luck', 'would', 'have', ""'re"", 'Black', 'Called', 'carpet', 'Board', 'receiving', 'support', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'Coleman', 'angrily', 'When', 'Silk', 'news', 'wife', 'fatal', 'heart', 'attack', 'Coleman', 'persecutors', 'killed', 'wrong', 'person.On', 'rebound', 'Silk', 'Faunia', 'Farely', 'Kidman', 'who', 'down', 'three', 'blue', 'collar', 'jobs', 'separated', 'abusive', 'husband', 'psychotic', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'named', 'Lester', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'ashes', 'two', 'dead', 'kids', 'bed', 'Faunia', 'troubled', 'situation', 'befitting', 'quot', 'trash', 'quot', 'more', 'baggage', 'loaded', '747', 'Silk', 'besotted', 'embarks', 'torrid', 'love', 'affair', '30-year', 'younger', 'woman', 'Silk', 'writer', 'friend', 'Nathan', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'quot', 'not', 'first', 'love', 'not', 'great', 'love', 'last', 'love', 'quot', 'great', 'sex', 'winter', 'Coleman', 'life', 'Even', 'Viagra', 'verbal', 'plug.THE', 'HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'also', 'tale', 'quot', 'racial', 'passing', 'quot', 'i.e', 'process', 'shifting', 'one', 'racial', 'identity', 'see', 'Coleman', 'secret', 'kept', 'buried', 'decades', 'No', 'not', 'Welsh', 'Hopkins', 'something', 'else', 'film', 'back', 'forth', '1998', 'late', '1940s', 'when', 'young', 'Silk', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'make', 'transition', 'abandon', 'natural', 'family', 'forever', 'only', 'now', 'last', 'orgasm', 'sharing', 'Faunia', 'Coleman', 'can', 'unburden', 'himself.The', 'plot', 'grist', 'maudlin', 'TV', 'soap', 'raised', 'heights', 'excellence', 'extraordinary', 'performances', 'especially', 'Hopkins', 'Kidman', 'wore', 'green', 'contact', 'match', 'Miller', 'eye', 'color', 'two', 'men', 'synchronized', 'speech', 'body', 'movement', 'characteristics', 'make', 'age', 'transition', 'as', 'seamless', 'possible', 'Nicole', 'spent', 'time', 'shelters', 'abused', 'women', 'acclimatize', 'aspects', 'role', 'scene', 'where', 'touch', 'back', 'Coleman', 'neck', 'Oscar', 'material', 'itself.Perhaps', 'most', 'poignant', 'sequence', 'young', 'Coleman', 'mother', 'Anna', 'Deavere', 'Smith', 'when', 'latter', 'what', 'birthday', 'present', 'might', 'be', 'five', 'years', 'hence', 'tears', 'son', 'eyes', 'perhaps', 'audience', 'Smith', 'role', 'not', 'extensive', 'certainly', 'memorable.', 'quot', 'Human', 'stain', 'quot', 'refers', 'indelible', 'mark', 'however', 'miniscule', 'universal', 'scheme', 'things', 'world', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'undone', 'film', 'Coleman', 'stain', 'coming', 'terms', 'it.At', 'one', 'point', 'Coleman', 'Faunia', 'battered', 'life', 'circumstances', 'what', 'relationship', 'quot', 'quot', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'truth']",The Human Stain

After one innocent remark is misinterpreted as a racist comment, he is forced to quit his job in disgrace.  Coleman begins a strange affair with an aimless woman (Nicole Kidman) half his age, who has had a tragic past and isn't ready to return his love.For me, this strange little movie was doomed from the start, when the big finish is shown right away.  The rest of the story is shown in choppy, anti-climactic flashbacks (often out of order) which didn't allow for any build-up in tension or sympathy for the main character, Coleman.  As a young man from New Jersey, he's played by Wentworth Miller who is quite charismatic and likeable, but looked and sounded nothing like the Welsh-accented adult Coleman (who sometimes appeared to channel a leering Hannibal Lector).  Hopkins is so horribly miscast in this role that it's impossible to buy the racially-charged plot.  Kidman was also completely wrong for this movie; her innate grace and elegance couldn't be hidden by a messy hairdo and I never bought her as an illiterate custodian.  Her graphic love scenes with Hopkins were more creepy than romantic.There is so much personal tragedy among the main characters  - including Gary Sinise who plays a troubled writer and Ed Harris as a crazed Vietnam vet - and yet the movie misfires completely and I felt no connection with them or the whole premise of injustice.

In the stress of the aftermath, Professor Coleman Silk's wife Iris is felled by a heart attack and dies.  And then, Silk (portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins) begins an unusual friendship with a reclusive writer, Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), who lives in a cabin by a lake on the outskirts of town.  As Silk reminisces - the goal is that Zuckerman will write a book about Silk's life - many secrets, held inside for more than fifty years, are revealed to the viewer.  But not to Zuckerman, apparently, because he is startled by the secrets at the very end of the film.Some of what Silk confesses is portrayed for us through flashbacks; the secrets are portrayed via flashbacks as ""memories"".  Then, almost as an aside, Silk describes an ""affair"" with a younger woman (Nicole Kidman): she is someone down-and-out, a former rich girl who ran away when she was being molested by a stepfather; and then, she becomes the abused wife of a Vietnam vet (Ed Harris), who stalks her and threatens her repeatedly.

816434,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0001XAPX8,Lee Armstrong,"[3, 6]","""The Human Stain"" is an intense drama directed by Robert Benton who won both the Best Director and the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscars for ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" in 1979.  He's also has 2 nominations for Best Original Screenplay Oscars for ""Bonnie & Clyde"" (1967) & ""The Late Show"" (1977) and a Best Director nomination for ""Places in the Heart"" (1984).  His direction here might have gained more attention if the film had worked a bit better.  Nicholas Meyer wrote the screenplay as he did for 1987's ""Fatal Attraction"" and his Oscar nominated Best Adapted Screenplay for ""The Seven Percent Solution"" (1976).  This is the third Philip Roth novel I'm aware of to be adapted to film following ""Goodbye Columbus"" (1969) & ""Portnoy's Complaint"" (1972).Anthony Hopkins who has an Oscar for ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) + 3 other nominations for ""The Remains of the Day,"" ""Nixon"" and ""Amistad"" plays the aging professor Coleman Silk with a bravado and intensity.  Phyillis Newman has a rare film cameo as his wife Iris Silk and has a wonderful heart attack scene where her arm flops uselessly.  I kept wondering why Hopkins wasn't calling 911, but that might have cut the drama.  Hopkins dances marvelously with Gary Sinise on the porch.  Sinise who has a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for ""Forest Gump"" and is currently riding high on TV in ""CSI New York"" plays Ginger Rogers to Hopkins' Fred Astaire and does some lovely pirouettes on the porch.  It's an odd scene, but it's interesting.Nicole Kidman who won the Oscar in ""The Hours"" and played in that film with Ed Harris who was also nominated for an Oscar plays Faunia Farley.  She does a great character performance of a sleazy trailer park trash janitor whose hard luck story of dead children broke her heart and her spirit.  Now she is pursued by crazy ex-con Lester Foley who ultimately drives her to the drink.  (Pun intended.)  Harris is explosive and displays more spirit in his brief role here than in most of the ""Empire Falls"" mini-series.The interesting part of the story has to do with the young Coleman Silk played by Wentworth Miller who is currently in the TV series ""Prison Break"" and also played in ""Underworld.""  Miller has a brooding self-centered intensity that serves the film well.  However, neither he nor Hopkins looks particularly black; so it becomes rather hard to believe.  Anna Deavere Smith from ""Philadelphia"" (1993) and a horror flick with Jon Bon Jovi this year called ""Cry Wolf"" has several excellent scenes as his mother who realizes that her race makes her not good enough for her ambitious son.

816435,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,B0001XAPX8,Linda Linguvic,"[3, 4]","I have a feeling that the book by Phillip Roth is a good novel.  The story is full of the complexities of a man who lives with a deep secret all his life.  And it questions political correctness and all the assumptions that go along with it.  It's a deeply human story, which brings up questions for which there are no easy answers.  And I'm sure that if I had read the book I would have embraced it completely. But I didn't read the book.  I saw the DVD.  And so I have to judge it on its own terms.Anthony Hopkins is cast as a college professor in New England.  He's been there for many years and is well respected.  And then he makes the mistake of saying something in class that is not politically correct because it seems to offend African Americans.  He loses his job over this.  And the upset causes his wife to have a heart attack and die.Somewhere along the line he makes a friend of Gary Sinese, a writer to whom he reveals his life story.  Through flashbacks, we learn that the professor is actually an African American himself who has crossed the color line in his youth and never looked back.Meanwhile, while the back-story is told in flashbacks, the professor has an affair with Nicole Kidman, a young woman half his age who works as a janitor.  Her ex-husband is deranged and abusive and actively pursues her.  She, too, is troubled deeply, and has led a difficult life with a lot of sadness.This is a serious story and is very depressing.  The acting is excellent too.  But I just couldn't get into it.  First of all, Anthony Hopkins does not look black.  And I never believed that Nicole Kidman was a working-class janitor.  The young man, Wentworth Miller, who is cast as the professor at a young age, doesn't look like Hopkins.  And the whole situation just didn't seem real.It was a very ambitious try on the part of the filmmakers to bring this story to the screen.  It is certainly a worthwhile film.  But there were just so many problems with its believability that I find it difficult to give it more than a lukewarm recommendation.",4,"Serious complex story, but the casting just didn't ring true",1097539200,"10 12, 2004",2004,2056,"['have', 'feeling', 'book', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'good', 'novel', 'story', 'full', 'complexities', 'man', 'who', 'deep', 'secret', 'life', 'questions', 'political', 'correctness', 'assumptions', 'go', 'along', 'deeply', 'human', 'story', 'up', 'questions', 'are', 'easy', 'answers', ""'m"", 'sure', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'embraced', 'completely', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'saw', 'DVD', 'so', 'have', 'judge', 'own', 'terms.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'cast', 'college', 'professor', 'New', 'England', 'been', 'there', 'many', 'years', 'well', 'respected', 'then', 'mistake', 'saying', 'something', 'class', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'offend', 'African', 'Americans', 'job', 'upset', 'wife', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'die.Somewhere', 'line', 'friend', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'writer', 'whom', 'life', 'story', 'flashbacks', 'learn', 'professor', 'actually', 'African', 'American', 'who', 'crossed', 'color', 'line', 'youth', 'never', 'looked', 'back.Meanwhile', 'back-story', 'told', 'flashbacks', 'professor', 'affair', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'young', 'woman', 'age', 'who', 'janitor', 'ex-husband', 'deranged', 'abusive', 'actively', 'too', 'troubled', 'deeply', 'led', 'difficult', 'life', 'lot', 'sadness.This', 'serious', 'story', 'very', 'depressing', 'acting', 'excellent', 'too', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'First', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'not', 'look', 'black', 'never', 'believed', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'working-class', 'janitor', 'young', 'man', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'who', 'cast', 'professor', 'young', 'age', ""n't"", 'look', 'Hopkins', 'whole', 'situation', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'real.It', 'was', 'very', 'ambitious', 'try', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'bring', 'story', 'screen', 'certainly', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'many', 'problems', 'believability', 'find', 'difficult', 'give', 'more', 'lukewarm', 'recommendation']",The Human Stain

816437,A3SKGQSU29ZV80,B0001XAPX8,Lleu Christopher,"[1, 2]","The Human Stain is one of those movies that seems to be self consciously striving for Oscar nominations. It features an all star cast, lots of tragedy and melodrama and weighty social issues involving race. Furthermore, it utilizes the overused technique of jumping back and forth in time, which in the case of the aging protagonist (played by Anthony Hopkins), means quite a few decades and allows for a large dose of nostalgia (accompanied by old songs of course) to be thrown into the mix. If this sounds like a cynical view of the movie, it's because the elements never really cohere. Hopkins, as always, gives a good performance, and Nicole Kidman and Gary Sinese are fine in supporting roles, but the plot, taken from a novel by Philip Roth, is meandering and top-heavy and it's hard to find a focal point.Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a Classics professor who resigns his position over a controversy involving race. Soon after, his wife dies, from causes apparently related to the stress of the situation. Coleman then meets the narrator of the tale, a writer played by Sinese, whose role is mainly to observe. Coleman begins an affair with a troubled younger woman (Kidman), whose life contains a laundry list of tragic elements, including a psychotic ex-husband who is stalking her.There's one primary &quot;secret&quot; that is central to the film; although it's been fairly well publicized, I prefer not to divulge it here. I will say, however, that it does not go well with the casting and further strains the viewer's credulity.

A former welterweight boxer who has turned his back on his race, Silk lives as a white man caught in an ironic twist of fate. In a fine blend of racism and religious intolerance before the gratuity of political correctness, the young Coleman makes irreversible decisions that critically affect his later years. As a deeply melancholic mature man, Coleman finds sudden happiness with Faunia in spite of her personal despondency and refusal to believe in joy.Moody and dark, played out against countryside covered with snow, the fine-tuned cinematography catches every nuance of shadow and flesh, as the movie evolves into an agonizing collision of desire vs. reality. Acting out the role of Achilles, pitted against fate and the grim determination of the gods, Silk refuses to give up the younger woman, no matter the consequences.The film is carefully balanced, shifting from present to past, exposing the painful histories of the characters, the roots of their flaws. The supporting roles are beautifully played by Gary Sinise as Nathan Zukerman, a reclusive writer and friend of Silk's and Ed Harris as Lester Farley, an ex-Vietnam vet unable to purge the violence from his life. In the end, seeking an island of comfort, Silk and Faunia gravitate to one another, sensing at least a temporary respite from an often cruel world. ""The things that restore you can destroy you.""

Hopkins gave me what I expected from him.  Senise is steady and is an effective narrator.  Harris' role is smaller than what I forecasted, but his lines are delivered with just the right mood and strength.  Kidman, for me, really shone.  She is one of my favorites, and in this film she is eccentric, tragic, vulnerable, harsh.However, as the plot untwists, I couldn't get past the possibility that Hopkins had been terribly miscast.  I won't spoil it for you, but this was a real distraction for me in the last quarter of the film.The performances across the board were excellent, however, the screenplay and directing could not hold up the other end of the bargain.  The very intriguing premise of the film included race relations, political correctness, and sexual relations between people aged 40 years apart; but it never really did more than scratch the surface.  The story was enough to hold my interest, but it never pushed into very unfamiliar territory.  It was also undermined by some superfluous scenes.

816448,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B0001XAPX8,mirasreviews,"[1, 1]","&quot;The Human Stain&quot; is based on the novel of the same name by Philip Roth, which employs the not entirely novel device of seeing through the eyes of a novelist. Gary Sinese plays novelist Nathan Zuckerman, who, after a bestseller and a divorce, has secluded himself in a cabin outside the town of Athena, Massachusetts. He grows close to the newly retired Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins), who has become an outcast of sorts himself, having been forced to retire after 35 years of service as a professor of classics and Dean of Faculty at nearby Athena College. Against the admonitions of friends and colleagues, Coleman has an improbable affair with a much-younger cleaning woman, Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman), which seems even less advisable when her unstable ex-husband (Ed Harris) arrives on the scene.&quot;The Human Stain&quot; has a deliberately slow pace. It diligently picks its way along. It seemed oppressive for the film's first half-hour, but eventually I was drawn in by the characters. Both Coleman and Faunia's characters are defined by their pasts, ironically, as both have dedicated their lives to putting the past behind them. The mysteries of these pasts are revealed slowly, and that is the means by which the audience is drawn into the story. Both Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman give impressive performances, but the casting is conspicuously odd. Neither of these characters looks his or her part in the least. This doesn't detract from their emotional power, but I have to wonder what the powers that be were thinking when they cast this film. I guess they were thinking that two talented A-list actors could pull anything off. Wentworth Miller is perfectly cast as the younger Coleman Silk. And I was particularly impressed by Anna Deavere Smith as Coleman's wise but heartbroken mother. &quot;The Human Stain&quot; is a nice character drama. It's just not for the impatient.The DVD: &quot;Behind the Scenes Special&quot; is an 8-minute featurette about making the film that includes interviews with the cast and director Robert Benton. It's not very focused and doesn't say much. &quot;Jean Yves Escoffer Tribute&quot; is a short tribute to cinematographer Jean Yves Escoffer to whom &quot;The Human Stain&quot; has been dedicated. It's a compilation of clips from films which he photographed and clips of Escoffer working behind the scenes. Escoffer died in 2003, after a 30-year career as a cinematographer.

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[5, 5]","I came into this movie knowing that, as has been proven time and time again in the history of novels being made into movies, that the adaptation would of course be an oversimplification of the complexity of the book.  The only question would be how gross the oversimplification would be.Philip Roth's novel is a forthright examination of the thoroughness of misery.  Roth, as perhaps the last among those we can call American Novelists, peers into the American character to see how we all suffer through depths of misery though we look anxiously for an easy lifestyle--we are, after all, Americans.  ButThe Human Staintakes an honest look at everyone, from Coleman Silk, a classics professor pushed out of his university position due to a charge of racism, which he explodes over because he is a man carrying far bigger secrets that are tearing him apart, to Lester Farley, an abusive, dangerous and violent ex-husband who is also an incredibly damaged Vietnam vet.Of course, for this movie, many of the character depths would have to be sliced away for the sake of time.  One of the slices here, unfortunately, is of Lester, which I think is a shame, because that is an immediate indication that the movie is not going to address the breadth of human character than the novel does.  Instead of being a sick SOB that we can actually feel bad for because of his own damage, Lester in this movie (played by Ed Harris, of course--who else?) is quite simply the raving ex-husband.This lack of depth is more unfortunate, considering some of the actrors that are pulled together for this--I mentioned Ed Harris, but also Anthony Hopkins, Nicole Kidman (who has been climbing higher and higher in my ladder of opinion), Gary Sinise--these are actors who could have dealt with the boxes within boxes of Roth's characterizations, but alas the script does not give them the opportunity.

Doyle ""film buff""","[13, 17]","THE HUMAN STAIN, from a novel by Philip Roth, is a handsomely produced independent film that strives hard to be a serious study of the effect racial prejudice has on an educated college professor (Anthony Hopkins) who retires when he is accused of using the word ""spooks"" to cover two of his students who have never showed up for class. In the course of the story, we learn that he himself is a black man passing for white and dealing with a secret he's kept in the dark for most of his life. It has an odd way of telling the story with frequent intervening and overlapping flashbacks that are sometimes hard to follow. Even odder is the casting of Anthony Hopkins as a black man who looks white.When he meets Nicole Kidman, we have two lost souls. She's running from her past, blaming herself for the accidental death of two children and running from a crazed ex-husband (Ed Harris) who threatens to break up her improbable relationship with the college professor. Kidman tackles a role beyond her scope as a trailer trash type who makes her living as a custodian cleaning up other people's messes. She is never convincing and makes the unappealing character both annoying and absurd, and has absolutely no chemistry with Hopkins. That he would be so attracted to her is highly improbable, given her sudden outbursts of insults and deep rooted anger.Ed Harris and Gary Sinise do well in underdeveloped roles and both have some very valid moments where they seem like real people instead of contrived characters. Too bad they don't play a greater part in the story.Production-wise, it's handsomely photographed in rugged winter settings but ""the message"" fails to get its points across with any subtlety. Wentworth Miller is appealing as the younger Hopkins, but it's hard to accept that the handsome dark-haired youth could turn into a man resembling the older Hopkins--and he's a bit of odd casting too.Kidman is forced to recite lines like: ""Action is the enemy of thought,"" which is about as meaningless as the priceless ""love means never having to say you're sorry"" (from LOVE STORY). She's a girl with no possessions who travels light, falls in love easily with an older man and later informs him that she has a crazed ex-husband. Both she and Hopkins have constructed their lives around a lie and it seems they deserve each other. Neither one becomes a sympathetic character we can really care about.An interesting failure, it tries to say serious things about race but too much of it is unbelievable and handicapped by unpleasant characterizations and implausible plot contrivances.",3,An odd way to tell a story about racial prejudice...,1194739200,"11 11, 2007",2007,2590,"['HUMAN', 'STAIN', 'novel', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'independent', 'film', 'hard', 'be', 'serious', 'study', 'effect', 'racial', 'prejudice', 'educated', 'college', 'professor', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'when', 'accused', 'using', 'word', 'spooks', 'cover', 'two', 'students', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'showed', 'up', 'class', 'course', 'story', 'learn', 'black', 'man', 'passing', 'white', 'dealing', 'secret', 'kept', 'dark', 'most', 'life', 'odd', 'way', 'telling', 'story', 'frequent', 'intervening', 'overlapping', 'flashbacks', 'are', 'sometimes', 'hard', 'follow', 'Even', 'odder', 'casting', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'white.When', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'have', 'two', 'lost', 'souls', 'running', 'past', 'blaming', 'accidental', 'death', 'two', 'children', 'running', 'crazed', 'ex-husband', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'break', 'up', 'improbable', 'relationship', 'college', 'professor', 'Kidman', 'role', 'scope', 'trailer', 'trash', 'type', 'who', 'living', 'custodian', 'cleaning', 'up', 'other', 'people', 'messes', 'never', 'convincing', 'unappealing', 'character', 'annoying', 'absurd', 'absolutely', 'chemistry', 'Hopkins', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'attracted', 'highly', 'improbable', 'given', 'sudden', 'outbursts', 'insults', 'deep', 'rooted', 'anger.Ed', 'Harris', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'do', 'well', 'underdeveloped', 'roles', 'have', 'very', 'valid', 'moments', 'where', 'seem', 'real', 'people', 'instead', 'contrived', 'characters', 'Too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'play', 'greater', 'part', 'story.Production-wise', 'handsomely', 'photographed', 'rugged', 'winter', 'settings', 'message', 'get', 'points', 'subtlety', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'appealing', 'younger', 'Hopkins', 'hard', 'accept', 'handsome', 'dark-haired', 'youth', 'could', 'turn', 'man', 'resembling', 'older', 'Hopkins', 'bit', 'odd', 'casting', 'too.Kidman', 'forced', 'recite', 'lines', 'Action', 'enemy', 'thought', 'as', 'meaningless', 'priceless', 'love', 'never', 'having', 'say', ""'re"", 'sorry', 'LOVE', 'STORY', 'girl', 'possessions', 'who', 'travels', 'light', 'love', 'easily', 'older', 'man', 'later', 'informs', 'crazed', 'ex-husband', 'Hopkins', 'have', 'constructed', 'lives', 'lie', 'deserve', 'other', 'one', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'can', 'really', 'care', 'about.An', 'interesting', 'failure', 'say', 'serious', 'things', 'race', 'too', 'much', 'unbelievable', 'handicapped', 'unpleasant', 'characterizations', 'implausible', 'plot', 'contrivances']",The Human Stain

816455,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,B0001XAPX8,"Phred ""Phred""","[1, 1]","Once upon a time it was a given statement that the book was better than the movie. Directors and screenwriters finally realized that with effort the movie could become a stand-alone achievement and on occasion come up on the better side of the comparison. Robert Benton's the Human Stain stands very well against the original Philip Roth novel. Movie making allows for a tighter, more streamlined construction and does a better job focusing on a select number of major story themes. What this movie lacks is much of the brilliant language of Philip Roth and a few complexities that make the larger story more credible. This is a very good movie it could have been a very great movie.Before the first word is spoken the gray winter and the dolorous music bring us to the sudden death of the two people will be the center of the balance of this movie. That's not a spoiler alert that's barely 30 seconds into the movie. In telling us the story of Dean Coleman Silk (a miscast Anthony Hopkins) and Faunia Farley (a frumpy Nicole Kidman) we start off knowing how the story will end but not knowing if the ending is in fact tragic.Dean Silk has recently been maneuvered out of his position as Dean of a small New England college. He is also taken up with a much younger and much less educated school janitor and postmistress for the nearby village. These are two profoundly damaged people each with tragic secrets. The vast distances between them in age, education and social circumstance do not matter so much as the common fact of their damaged lives. In finding each other and in finding love the plot question is: have they resolved their respective lives such that they are now ready for what we know will be their death?In streamlining the story we lose all of the politics that came together to strip Dean Coleman of his position. The simplified story involving the professor's use of the word ""spook"" to describe students he had never seen. Students who, because they are black are able to complain that use of the word spook constitutes racism. Absent the larger context of university maneuvering this complaint comes off as insufficient for ending and otherwise honorable career. Additionally Sir Anthony Hopkins for all his brilliant acting lacks the correct accent and he is not convincing as a New Jersey Jew; never mind that this is persona is a beard for who he really is.Faunia's ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris) is a wonderful performance as a psychotic Vietnam vet and spouse abuser. In the book I felt that the psychotic Vietnam vet character was somewhat cliched in the movie this aspect of the character is unnecessary and should have been trimmed. By 2003 the issues of ex-husband stalking and spouse abuse was sufficiently standardized that there was very little to be gain by heaping yet another insult on Vietnam veterans.These errors aside the Human Stain is a very good movie. It is drama, but hardly intense drama. For all the choppy, out of sequence flashbacks the story flows in a reasonably ordered progression of reveals and explanations.

Marsella,"[3, 3]",Philip Roth's book The Human Stain was a fictional examination of racial/social and sexual biases in American culture with more than a dose of hypocrisy thrown in. I expected it to be a difficult novel to translate to film and I believe I was partially right.The casting is excellent and Nicole Kidman is very good as Faunia Farley a bit of a lost soul being stalked by her violent and insane ex-husband who gets involved with an older college professor who has just lost his position due to an abnormally ridiculous case of Political Correctness. Anthony Hopkins is fabulous in that role although as the plot unfolds it becomes a bit harder to see him as the older version of his younger self as portrayed in flashback sequences. (Trying hard not to give too much away here).A real strong performance by Ed Harris ( The most underrated guy in Hollywood) as the crazed husband cements this as a film worth checking out.It's understandable why this wasn't a huge hit at the box office because it is a literary and somewhat challenging film.,4,Having Read the Book I wanted to Satisfy My Curiosity About the Transfer to Film,1181952000,"06 16, 2007",2007,1039,"['Philip', 'Roth', 'book', 'Human', 'Stain', 'was', 'fictional', 'examination', 'racial/social', 'sexual', 'biases', 'American', 'culture', 'more', 'dose', 'hypocrisy', 'thrown', 'expected', 'be', 'difficult', 'novel', 'translate', 'film', 'believe', 'was', 'partially', 'right.The', 'casting', 'excellent', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'very', 'good', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'bit', 'lost', 'soul', 'being', 'stalked', 'violent', 'insane', 'ex-husband', 'who', 'involved', 'older', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'just', 'lost', 'position', 'due', 'abnormally', 'ridiculous', 'case', 'Political', 'Correctness', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'fabulous', 'role', 'plot', 'bit', 'harder', 'see', 'older', 'version', 'younger', 'self', 'portrayed', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Trying', 'hard', 'not', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'here', '.A', 'real', 'strong', 'performance', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'most', 'underrated', 'guy', 'Hollywood', 'crazed', 'husband', 'cements', 'film', 'checking', 'out.It', 'understandable', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'huge', 'hit', 'box', 'office', 'literary', 'somewhat', 'challenging', 'film']",The Human Stain

After five years of silence (the longest in his career since the gap between his first and second films), Benton emerged in 2003 with The Human Stain, based on Philip Roth's rather obscure (for Roth, anyway) novel, and comes up with an interesting, complex, well-acted little film that far too few people saw.Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins) is a professor at a small New England university. As the movie opens, he is accused of racism and his tenure is revoked, leading to the death of his wife, Iris (Phyllis Newman, of the fine, cancelled-far-too-early show 100 Centre St.), from a heart attack. His resulting rage at this pair of injustices leads him to the friendship of a local writer, Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), and romance with a young woman who works as a janitor at the school, Faunia Farley (Nicole Kidman). Faunia's ex-husband Lester (Ed Harris) is not too thrilled about the latter. Underlying it all is a secret Silk has been keeping for half a century that might destroy him... or save him.Screenplay writer Nicholas Meyer sure has come a long way since Invasion of the Bee Girls. Here he takes a Philip Roth novel and does it justice, though to be fair it's kind of hard to buy Anthony Hopkins, of all people, in this role. If you can swallow your disbelief once the secret is revealed (and while that does happen relatively early on, it's still a spoiler), you're golden. Kidman plays her role to the hilt, taking on, in essence, the role Susan Sarandon popularized in the similarly-neglected 1990 film White Palace. Roth swung the age difference, but the rest of the trappings of the romantic tale are in place, and work just as well here as they did there. Zuckerman, Roth's detached and somewhat bemused Everyman character, sits on the sidelines and observes everything. I can't imagine what temptation there must be for anyone adapting a Zuckerman novel to bring Nathan himself to the forefront, but it's got to be monstrous (Nathan Zuckerman, after all, is the enduring character of Roth's novels, while everyone around him just passes through). Meyer resists, though, and Gary Sinise acts the part wonderfully. In the one scene where Zuckerman's presence indirectly affects the plot, Sinise just sits there looking half-embarrassed to be an agent of change. It's great stuff. Hopkins, on the other hand, is huge and bombastic and chews as much scenery as did Edward G. Robinson in his prime, and it fits. A fine film. If you missed it in its theatrical release, and you probably did, check it out on DVD. *** ",4,Too good to have been an American hit in the theatres.,1169683200,"01 25, 2007",2007,2735,"['Human', 'Stain', 'Robert', 'Benton', '2003', 'Robert', 'Benton', 'not', 'often', 'direct', 'movies', 'when', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'guaranteed', 'knockout', 'Kramer', 'Kramer', 'Places', 'Heart', 'Nobody', 'Fool', 'five', 'years', 'silence', 'longest', 'career', 'gap', 'first', 'second', 'films', 'Benton', 'emerged', '2003', 'Human', 'Stain', 'based', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'rather', 'obscure', 'Roth', 'anyway', 'novel', 'up', 'interesting', 'complex', 'well-acted', 'little', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'people', 'saw.Coleman', 'Silk', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'professor', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'university', 'movie', 'accused', 'racism', 'tenure', 'revoked', 'leading', 'death', 'wife', 'Iris', 'Phyllis', 'Newman', 'fine', 'cancelled-far-too-early', 'show', '100', 'Centre', 'St.', 'heart', 'attack', 'resulting', 'rage', 'pair', 'injustices', 'friendship', 'local', 'writer', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'romance', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'janitor', 'school', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Faunia', 'ex-husband', 'Lester', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'not', 'too', 'thrilled', 'latter', 'Underlying', 'secret', 'Silk', 'been', 'keeping', 'century', 'might', 'destroy', 'save', 'him.Screenplay', 'writer', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'sure', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'Invasion', 'Bee', 'Girls', 'Here', 'Philip', 'Roth', 'novel', 'justice', 'be', 'fair', 'kind', 'hard', 'buy', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'people', 'role', 'can', 'swallow', 'disbelief', 'secret', 'revealed', 'happen', 'relatively', 'early', 'still', 'spoiler', ""'re"", 'golden', 'Kidman', 'role', 'hilt', 'taking', 'essence', 'role', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'popularized', 'similarly-neglected', '1990', 'film', 'White', 'Palace', 'Roth', 'swung', 'age', 'difference', 'rest', 'trappings', 'romantic', 'tale', 'are', 'place', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'here', 'did', 'there', 'Zuckerman', 'Roth', 'detached', 'somewhat', 'bemused', 'Everyman', 'character', 'sidelines', 'everything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'temptation', 'must', 'be', 'anyone', 'adapting', 'Zuckerman', 'novel', 'bring', 'Nathan', 'forefront', 'got', 'be', 'monstrous', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'enduring', 'character', 'Roth', 'novels', 'everyone', 'just', 'passes', 'Meyer', 'though', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'part', 'wonderfully', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'Zuckerman', 'presence', 'indirectly', 'plot', 'Sinise', 'just', 'there', 'looking', 'half-embarrassed', 'be', 'agent', 'change', 'great', 'stuff', 'Hopkins', 'other', 'hand', 'huge', 'bombastic', 'as', 'much', 'scenery', 'did', 'Edward', 'G.', 'Robinson', 'prime', 'fine', 'film', 'missed', 'theatrical', 'release', 'probably', 'did', 'check', 'out', 'DVD', '***']",The Human Stain
816459,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001XAPX8,Roland E. Zwick,"[5, 6]","""The Human Stain"" is about two individuals, battered and bruised by life, who try to find meaning and purpose in a May/December romance.  Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Coleman Silk, a college professor who ""resigns"" just prior to his retirement after a student unjustly accuses him of making a racist comment in his classroom.  Compounding the tragedy, Coleman also loses his wife to a brain aneurysm, the direct result, Coleman believes, of stress caused by both the accusation and the lack of support he receives from friends, colleagues and university officials concerning the charge.  The irony is that Coleman, unbeknownst to anyone else, is actually a light-skinned black man who has spent his adult life hiding his true identity from the world.  Coleman's life takes a seeming turn for the better when he enters into an affair with Faunia Farley, a 34-year old cleaning woman (Nicole Kidman) who has lost her two children in a fire and who is being stalked by her violent, mentally unstable husband, played by Ed Harris.  The fourth major character is Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), a reclusive author who becomes a friend and confidante of the ex-professor, and who ends up writing a story about this odd but compelling relationship.""The Human Stain"" is an uneven, often muddled film that still has a great deal to offer the discriminating viewer.  On the negative side, Hopkins is woefully miscast in the lead role, not because he delivers a bad performance (he doesn`t), but because we find it virtually impossible to accept him as an African American passing himself off as white.  This may, indeed, be a case of a bridge too far when it comes to the extent to which we are willing to suspend our disbelief for any story, no matter how worthy its aspirations.  The film also suffers at times from a lack of clear definition, particularly with the Kidman character who remains pretty much an enigma throughout.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing since ambiguity is often more intriguing than clarity, but the filmmakers in this case needed to work a bit harder in developing her character.  Coleman's story is considerably more compelling, particularly in the scenes flashing back to the 1940's, as Coleman as a young man (well played by Wentworth Miller), has to cope with the difficulties of being a racially ambiguous person in a clear-cut, black-and-white world.  Frankly, the movie might have been more interesting had it focused on this aspect of the story and dropped the main plot line altogether.Still, ""The Human Stain"" is worth watching, albeit more for what it promises than for what it delivers.  The plotting may not always hold up under scrutiny, but the tone of quiet sadness that permeates the film pulls us into the tale anyway.  Here are two people who have been so mistreated by circumstances that even they don't know what it is they're searching for.  They just know that they can't continue going through life alone with no one to rely on for support.  As a result, we find ourselves drawn to these two people even though we can't always figure out why.  Hopkins (despite the serious credibility problem) and Kidman underplay their roles nicely, highlighting the sadness and vulnerability of their emotionally wounded characters.""The Human Stain"" is a mixed bag of a movie, an admirably original and complex film that never quite brings all its various elements together.  Sinise and Harris` characters seem particularly contrived and tacked on, little more than awkward devices inserted to keep the plot moving along.  Still, in this day and age when most films provide little or no food for thought, even an unsatisfying work like ""The Human Stain"" can serve as nutrition for the starved soul.",3,uneven though interesting film,1099440000,"11 3, 2004",2004,3726,"['Human', 'Stain', 'about', 'two', 'individuals', 'battered', 'bruised', 'life', 'who', 'try', 'find', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'May/December', 'romance', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Dr.', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'resigns', 'just', 'prior', 'retirement', 'student', 'unjustly', 'making', 'racist', 'comment', 'classroom', 'Compounding', 'tragedy', 'Coleman', 'also', 'wife', 'brain', 'aneurysm', 'direct', 'result', 'Coleman', 'stress', 'caused', 'accusation', 'lack', 'support', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'university', 'officials', 'concerning', 'charge', 'irony', 'Coleman', 'unbeknownst', 'anyone', 'else', 'actually', 'light-skinned', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'adult', 'life', 'hiding', 'true', 'identity', 'world', 'Coleman', 'life', 'seeming', 'turn', 'better', 'when', 'affair', 'Faunia', 'Farley', '34-year', 'old', 'cleaning', 'woman', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'who', 'lost', 'two', 'children', 'fire', 'who', 'being', 'stalked', 'violent', 'mentally', 'unstable', 'husband', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'fourth', 'major', 'character', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'reclusive', 'author', 'who', 'friend', 'confidante', 'ex-professor', 'who', 'up', 'writing', 'story', 'odd', 'compelling', 'relationship', 'Human', 'Stain', 'uneven', 'often', 'muddled', 'film', 'still', 'great', 'deal', 'offer', 'discriminating', 'viewer', 'negative', 'side', 'Hopkins', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'lead', 'role', 'not', 'bad', 'performance', 't', 'find', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'accept', 'African', 'American', 'passing', 'off', 'white', 'may', 'indeed', 'be', 'case', 'bridge', 'too', 'far', 'when', 'extent', 'are', 'willing', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'story', 'matter', 'how', 'worthy', 'aspirations', 'film', 'also', 'times', 'lack', 'clear', 'definition', 'particularly', 'Kidman', 'character', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'enigma', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'ambiguity', 'often', 'more', 'intriguing', 'clarity', 'filmmakers', 'case', 'needed', 'work', 'bit', 'harder', 'developing', 'character', 'Coleman', 'story', 'considerably', 'more', 'compelling', 'particularly', 'scenes', 'flashing', 'back', '1940', 'as', 'Coleman', 'young', 'man', 'well', 'played', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'cope', 'difficulties', 'being', 'racially', 'ambiguous', 'person', 'clear-cut', 'black-and-white', 'world', 'Frankly', 'movie', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'had', 'focused', 'aspect', 'story', 'dropped', 'main', 'plot', 'line', 'altogether.Still', 'Human', 'Stain', 'worth', 'watching', 'more', 'what', 'what', 'plotting', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'hold', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'tone', 'quiet', 'sadness', 'film', 'tale', 'anyway', 'Here', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'mistreated', 'circumstances', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'searching', 'just', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'continue', 'going', 'life', 'alone', 'one', 'rely', 'support', 'result', 'find', 'drawn', 'two', 'people', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'always', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'serious', 'credibility', 'problem', 'Kidman', 'underplay', 'roles', 'nicely', 'highlighting', 'sadness', 'vulnerability', 'emotionally', 'wounded', 'characters', 'Human', 'Stain', 'mixed', 'bag', 'movie', 'admirably', 'original', 'complex', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'various', 'elements', 'together', 'Sinise', 'Harris', 'characters', 'seem', 'particularly', 'contrived', 'tacked', 'little', 'more', 'awkward', 'devices', 'inserted', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'along', 'Still', 'day', 'age', 'when', 'most', 'films', 'provide', 'little', 'food', 'thought', 'even', 'unsatisfying', 'work', 'Human', 'Stain', 'can', 'serve', 'nutrition', 'starved', 'soul']",The Human Stain

816462,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0001XAPX8,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 3]","Early in &quot;The Human Stain,&quot; a young man meets a woman. It's *the* woman, and although the scene is short it is perfectly played, and we know. We also know that the young man harbors a secret, which he will be forced to reveal just once, after which the woman will be lost, and so will the man for 45 years. Philip Roth's book and Robert Benton's movie is about that man, Coleman Silk, in his final year, and how he finds himself again in a woman.The movie is, of course, much more complex than that. Too complex.Silk is the mastodon dean of the classics department at a New England liberal arts school who is charged with racism after referring to absent students as &quot;spooks.&quot; Those students, whom Silk has never seen, are black. And so is Silk, though, played by Anthony Hopkins, he doesn't look it. Nor does anyone else know, because that's his secret. Faced with revealing his race to save his job, Silk instead resigns, his wife dies from the shock of Silk's tumultuous decline, and the fallen dean befriends a reclusive writer (Gary Sinise). He also meets a dairy worker, Faunia (Nicole Kidman), who's young, rough around the edges, sexually adventurous.And so begins Silk's reawakening. Roth's book jumps around freely in time and points of view and so does the movie in an attempt to make some coherent point about privacy, personal identity, shame and loss. The book and movie are set against the backdrop of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal - it seems like a grab for historical import in the book, while it is a distraction in the movie - and has several scenes set in the 1940s, as an 18-year-old Silk (Wentworth Miller) meets Minnesotan Sheena (Jacinda Barrett) and begins a brief, intense courtship. Miller and Barrett, in short shrift, develop instant, excellent chemistry - better than Hopkins and Kidman do in the present day scenes - which makes the moment when Sheena meets Silk's refined, soft-spoken black mother (Anna Deveare Smith) direct and tragic.Silk's new romance is equally troubled, although it's Faunia with the disreputable label. She broadcasts her flooziness, and her husband, ex-Vietnam vet Lester (an electric, scary Ed Harris) hunts her from one sexual encounter to another. Silk, robust and virile as he is, is not fully prepared for this woman or her past.&quot;The Human Stain&quot; only works in spots; like the book, it has its moments, such as when old Silk dresses down a preppy lawyer, or Sheena &quot;dances&quot; for young Silk, but Benton and screenwriter Nicholas Meyer pile on so many themes that we're left only the aroma of a story, not an actual one. Kidman is the wrong actress for Faunia - talking in low scratch and chain-smoking does not a roughwoman make. Hopkins is better, but curiously distant as Silk, who is so far inside his own vision of himself that he still seems to be peering out for the coast to be clear. Harris steals every scene he's in, which is few.The movie would been smarter to stay rooted in the past, during Silk's critical growth period.

To learn that lesson is to turn a stain into a blessing.Stylistically, I felt the theme could have been dealt with in a somewhat smarter way. Without giving too much away, the ""scandal"" at the heart of the movie really gets very little screen time which helps diminish its importance in comparison with Coleman's past. But we see so little of it that it belittles its own thematic importance, and the movie spends a great deal of energy setting up storylines and elements that get little eventual payoff.This is why I say the novel was a bit difficult to adapt. Following Coleman's life all the way along, not just its beginning and end, could have made the movie work better as a movie; so could exposing his secret to the world of the film instead of just to the audience. At one point, Coleman's sister says doing just that would have instantly cleared up all the scandal and misunderstanding. Wrong. It would have made everything much more complicated, much more textured, much less black-and-white. As it is, we are left with a movie about two people whose lives have already ended clinging to each other for comfort.But the cast alone is something I'd go rushing into the theatres for: Hopkins, Kidman, Harris.  Hopkins' acting here is a slow, painful flowering, and Kidman, who late in the film has a long dialog delivered with such musical delicacy that it becomes an aria of regret and self-apprehension.In sum, despite my gripes with the handling of the film, this is a film you HAVE to see.

816466,APDPA11IZPYLN,B0001XAPX8,"Sheila Chilcote-Collins ""Sheila Renee Chilcot...","[60, 71]","Phillip Roth's final tale in his trilogy, ""The Human Stain"" is set in the summer of The Year Of Our Lord, 1998. Otherwise known as ""Impeachment Summer"", during which the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky accusations took place, The Starr Report was released, and the whole sordid story of the infamous stained dress was on the lips of everyone, so to speak.The film is told in flashback sequences with the narrator of the tale, writer and friend of main character, Coleman Silk's. His name is Nathan Zuckerman (a fabulous Gary Sinese). Incidentally, the character of Nathan Zuckerman is the author, Phillip Roth's alter-ego and is throughout the trilogy of novels.Coleman Silk, played adeptly by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is a 71 year-old college professor at small New England Athena College. Coleman is wrongfully accused of racial slurs against a couple of absent pupils and loses his tenured position. This shocking news sends his beloved wife into sickness and before long, she succumbs...If only his family, friends and all the people that Coleman Silk has touched throughout  their lives knew the REAL story, such charges would have never been brought about in the first place.Silk gets lonely and depressed quite quickly, finds the wonderful drug just produced by the name of Viagra and meets the illiterate but beautiful school janitor, Faunia Farley, played by Nicole Kidman. Faunia might be illiterate but she has graduated with honors from ""The School Of Hard Knocks"", both figuratively and literally by her Vietnam vet abusive husband Lester, played excellently by Ed Harris. Coleman and Faunia have a torrid affair with the whole New England town buzzing about the goings on. As they get closer and share with one another, Faunia's past is almost as shocking as Coleman's. In the final scenes of the film, all secrets are exposed...Many critics said that the movie script itself was a masterpiece but it was grossly miscast with Hopkins and Kidman in the main roles. I disagree only because there are very few actors that could genuinely and convincingly portray the characters, let alone, carry a heavy drama such as this. The only actor that I could come up with for a recast on Coleman would be Frank Langella, in part because the physical characteristics of Coleman could have been a bit more believable to the viewer.I must also mention the two actors who play an integral role in the flashback sequences of Coleman's youth. A terrific Wentworth Miller as Young Coleman Silk and an adequate Jacinda Barrett (from MTV's Real World London Cast) in a nice turn as young Coleman's college days lover, Steena Paulsson.Once watching the movie, you will understand the many significant meanings of the title, ""The Human Stain"". Not only the stain of the original sin into which all of us are born, but the stain of hate, hurt, pain, racism, pacifism and yes, even love and death.I highly recommend ""The Human Stain"" despite it's theatrical release mixed reviews and unfortunate lackluster box office draw.Happy Watching!",4,Phillip Roth's Final Trilogy Tale Comes To Life On Screen,1096329600,"09 28, 2004",2004,3026,"['Phillip', 'Roth', 'final', 'tale', 'trilogy', 'Human', 'Stain', 'set', 'summer', 'Year', 'Lord', '1998', 'Otherwise', 'known', 'Impeachment', 'Summer', 'Bill', 'Clinton', 'Monica', 'Lewinsky', 'accusations', 'took', 'place', 'Starr', 'Report', 'was', 'released', 'whole', 'sordid', 'story', 'infamous', 'stained', 'dress', 'was', 'lips', 'everyone', 'so', 'speak.The', 'film', 'told', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'narrator', 'tale', 'writer', 'friend', 'main', 'character', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'name', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'fabulous', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'Incidentally', 'character', 'Nathan', 'Zuckerman', 'author', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'alter-ego', 'trilogy', 'novels.Coleman', 'Silk', 'played', 'adeptly', 'Sir', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', '71', 'year-old', 'college', 'professor', 'small', 'New', 'England', 'Athena', 'College', 'Coleman', 'wrongfully', 'accused', 'racial', 'slurs', 'couple', 'absent', 'pupils', 'tenured', 'position', 'shocking', 'news', 'beloved', 'wife', 'sickness', 'long', 'succumbs', 'only', 'family', 'friends', 'people', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'touched', 'lives', 'knew', 'REAL', 'story', 'such', 'charges', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'brought', 'first', 'place.Silk', 'lonely', 'depressed', 'quite', 'quickly', 'wonderful', 'drug', 'just', 'produced', 'name', 'Viagra', 'illiterate', 'beautiful', 'school', 'janitor', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Faunia', 'might', 'be', 'illiterate', 'graduated', 'honors', 'School', 'Hard', 'Knocks', 'figuratively', 'literally', 'Vietnam', 'vet', 'abusive', 'husband', 'Lester', 'played', 'excellently', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Coleman', 'Faunia', 'have', 'torrid', 'affair', 'whole', 'New', 'England', 'town', 'buzzing', 'goings', 'get', 'closer', 'share', 'one', 'Faunia', 'past', 'almost', 'as', 'shocking', 'Coleman', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'secrets', 'are', 'exposed', 'Many', 'critics', 'said', 'movie', 'script', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'grossly', 'miscast', 'Hopkins', 'Kidman', 'main', 'roles', 'disagree', 'only', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'could', 'genuinely', 'convincingly', 'portray', 'characters', 'let', 'alone', 'carry', 'heavy', 'drama', 'such', 'only', 'actor', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'recast', 'Coleman', 'would', 'be', 'Frank', 'Langella', 'part', 'physical', 'characteristics', 'Coleman', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'more', 'believable', 'viewer.I', 'must', 'also', 'mention', 'two', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'integral', 'role', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'Coleman', 'youth', 'terrific', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'Young', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'adequate', 'Jacinda', 'Barrett', 'MTV', 'Real', 'World', 'London', 'Cast', 'nice', 'turn', 'young', 'Coleman', 'college', 'days', 'lover', 'Steena', 'Paulsson.Once', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'understand', 'many', 'significant', 'meanings', 'title', 'Human', 'Stain', 'Not', 'only', 'stain', 'original', 'sin', 'are', 'born', 'stain', 'hate', 'hurt', 'pain', 'racism', 'pacifism', 'yes', 'even', 'love', 'death.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Human', 'Stain', 'theatrical', 'release', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'unfortunate', 'lackluster', 'box', 'office', 'draw.Happy', 'Watching']",The Human Stain

Certain reviewers have complained that it is 'pompous', I suppose because it takes place in a college environment, or that both Anthony Hopkins and Nicole Kidman are miscast. It concerns a classics professor, age 71, African American though nearly white in appearance, who is falsely accused of racism and quits in protest; this event kills his wife; he soon becomes involved with a distinctly intellectually inferior woman whom, through sex and other forms of communication, he soon comes to consider his soul mate, despite opposition both from his lawyer and from her boorish former husband. It is in fact a good match, between an intelligent man who is somewhat over the hill physically and a vital young woman whose former husband and 2 dead children would make anyone cry. Ed Harris is superbly evil as her insanely jealous ex-husband who knows she is having sex with another man. Faunia is a somewhat pitiable character, not too bright, who works as a cleaning woman. There is also a writer who is hired to write Coleman's biography. Faunia's chain smoking, which is sometimes gratuitous in Hollywood movies, in this case is effective in defining her character.At least half the movie concerns Coleman's young manhood, during which time he rejected his African American family and set out to live life as white, and Jewish. These flashbacks show him as a successful undefeated boxer in his youth and also reveal an affair he had with a college student of Scandinavian descent.In the present he still considers himself white and cannot bring himself to reveal his past, although it might have saved his job. The lovers die in a car accident, which provides the forum for more reminiscences on Coleman's life.

816468,AJDYDG7YZY9QL,B0001XAPX8,Stephen A. Haines,"[1, 1]","This film grabs the viewer from the opening scene.  Through a winter's bleak landscape, a car's easy progress along the dark road is enhanced by the sedate pace of the background music.  Before the credits have stopped running, the car is rolling into the roadside stream, the occupants clearly lost.  An oncoming vehicle has driven them off the road deliberately, then continues on.  Why has such a murder occurred?Coleman Sylk [Hopkins] a classics scholar, denies a student's charge of racism as ""spectacularly false"", yet resigns his college post in protest.  He contacts Nathan Zuckerman [Sinise] to commission him to write the story of his life - the son of ""the only Jewish saloon keeper in East Orange"".  Zuckerman, a writer suffering ""block"" is reluctant to undertake the task, but as he learns more about Sylk, he becomes fascinated by the man.  The unfolding story is far more of ""An American Tragedy"" than Theodore Dreiser could have ever envisioned.Sylk, whose real story is far more convoluted than that of the ""son of a Jewish saloon keeper"", is an angry man.  His outbursts aren't violent - that aspect of his life is clearly under tight control.  But the events of his youth are reflected in his dealings with others in his later life.  To explain this, Sylk's early life [Wentworth Miller] is portrayed as a succession of deceptions, from his struggle to follow his own desires against his father's wishes, to that father's own role in life.  Coleman wanted to be boxer - he was good in the ring.  But he follows a different path to become a classical scholar.  The ""first Jew to teach classical literature in America"" - according to narrator Zuckerman.The source of Coleman's ire becomes clear when he tells Zuckerman about his first love.  While in university, he meets a young woman and invites her home to dinner.  The result is an act in a long-term tragedy. A tragedy that has yet to be played out both in the film and in real life.  Convoluting Coleman's already bizarre existence is his unexpected encounter with Faunia Farley [Nicole Kidman].  In what is demonstrably her best role, Kidman is a woman beset by tragic circumstances.  Their liaison, which should be completely out of character for both, proves stable and enduring.  A cynical farm woman struggling for survival, she should have little to offer the classics scholar.  But Coleman's own struggles provide a hidden bond.  The two become lovers, mutually reinforcing and restoring a positive approach to their lives.It's easy for Hopkins to impart tension in a film role - he's done it often enough.  But here, he displays a new version of that emotion.  There is the visible manifestation of self-control.  While he can release his rage when he's relating his story to Zuckerman, a whole new aspect appears when he's with Kidman.  In turn, while she might simply be grateful for his attention, Kidman becomes enamoured of his qualities.  She discovers his strengths and capacities, leading her to develop a sincere affection for this stranger.  Together, the endure challenges and overcome them.  All but the last one.There are many roles in this film deserving applause.  Anna Deveare Smith's depiction of Coleman's mother, Ed Harris as Faunia's ex-husband and, of course, Jacinda Barrett as Coleman's university-days lover stand out well under Benton's direction.  Hopkins and Kidman, however, rightly dominate this production.  Kidman, in particular, exhibits a capacity hardly promised in her other roles.  This film is reminiscent of two of Sean Connery's in which two co-stars, Lorraine Bracco and Catherine Zeta-Jones seem to suddenly blossom out of previous mediocrity.

816471,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001XAPX8,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 2]","As I have not read the original book by Philip Ross, I cannot say for certain whether or not the book is better than the film -- kind of usual debate surrounding any novel.  But I can say this for sure -- the story about is very interesting, and the theme very intriguing, but the unbelievable casting ruins everything.Anthony Hopkins plays a Jewish professor of classic literature, Coleman Silk, who resigns his post after referring to the absentee student, using, some argue, politically incorrect word.  Remember, the time is set in 1998, when that kind of PC debate was still going on.  Silk, after losing his job and wife too, meets a chain-smoking woman Faunia Farley, who works at university and post-office, played by Nicole Kidman.  And Faunia, it seems, is trying to shake off the sad, traumatic memories about her husband who came back from Vietnam (Ed Harris).All these stories are told by Zuckerman, generally supposed to be alter ego of the writer Ross, and Gary Sinese appears as him, living alone in a hut.  Then Zuckerman (and we) will know the secret of Professor Silk, who in fact was not Jewish, and buried secrets about his family in the past.Now, think about this.  Anthony Hopkins, born in Wales if I am not mistaken, is hardly the right choice for the role.  Not that he is not intellectual ... he definitely is ... but he never looks the way the film requires.  And Sinese as Zuckeman is also a strange choice, for Zuckerman must be, considering his profile, much older than Sinese is.And the same thing goes to Nicole Kidman.  After playing Virginia Wolfe or Satine, she cannot play this role.  I don't say that a chain-smoking woman  working at a dairy farm cannot be like Nicole Kidman.  It's only that we have seen too many of her, and we feel that she is stretching her acting too much.What is most regreattable is that the younger Coleman Silk played by Wentworth Miller is so convincing.  I know his personal background, and that lends some power to the credible character, but the fact is that Mr. Miller himself is a talented actor, perhaps, as far as the film goes, better suited to the role of Mr. Silk, than Hopkins, who is getting hammier these days.The film is beautifully shot (the last film by photographer Jean-Yves Escoffier), and the theme is a worthy one, but the script by Nicholas Meyer is curiously hollow.  It sporadically delves the deeper places of the character(s), but is too busy keeping up with the pace, trying to include many things in the film.  Strange thing is, Zuckerman, who should be the link to the characters, is least effective, just muddling through the novel's world.  Did we need him after all?I am hugely disappointed by the result, and especially the casting, though I admit that the central characters are interesting, and the material is worth discussing.  Maybe we should read the book, as many reviewers would say after watching the filmed versions of their beloved books.",2,Intriguing Theme That Needs More Careful Casting,1090627200,"07 24, 2004",2004,2947,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'original', 'book', 'Philip', 'Ross', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'certain', 'not', 'book', 'better', 'film', 'kind', 'usual', 'debate', 'surrounding', 'novel', 'can', 'say', 'sure', 'story', 'very', 'interesting', 'theme', 'very', 'intriguing', 'unbelievable', 'casting', 'ruins', 'everything.Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Jewish', 'professor', 'classic', 'literature', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'who', 'resigns', 'post', 'referring', 'absentee', 'student', 'using', 'argue', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'word', 'Remember', 'time', 'set', '1998', 'when', 'kind', 'PC', 'debate', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'Silk', 'losing', 'job', 'wife', 'too', 'chain-smoking', 'woman', 'Faunia', 'Farley', 'who', 'university', 'post-office', 'played', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Faunia', 'trying', 'shake', 'off', 'sad', 'traumatic', 'memories', 'husband', 'who', 'came', 'back', 'Vietnam', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'stories', 'are', 'told', 'Zuckerman', 'generally', 'supposed', 'be', 'alter', 'ego', 'writer', 'Ross', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'living', 'alone', 'hut', 'Then', 'Zuckerman', 'will', 'know', 'secret', 'Professor', 'Silk', 'who', 'fact', 'was', 'not', 'Jewish', 'buried', 'secrets', 'family', 'past.Now', 'think', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'born', 'Wales', 'am', 'not', 'mistaken', 'hardly', 'right', 'choice', 'role', 'Not', 'not', 'intellectual', 'definitely', 'never', 'way', 'film', 'Sinese', 'Zuckeman', 'also', 'strange', 'choice', 'Zuckerman', 'must', 'be', 'considering', 'profile', 'much', 'older', 'Sinese', 'is.And', 'same', 'thing', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'playing', 'Virginia', 'Wolfe', 'Satine', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'role', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'chain-smoking', 'woman', 'working', 'dairy', 'farm', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'only', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'feel', 'stretching', 'acting', 'too', 'much.What', 'most', 'regreattable', 'younger', 'Coleman', 'Silk', 'played', 'Wentworth', 'Miller', 'so', 'convincing', 'know', 'personal', 'background', 'power', 'credible', 'character', 'fact', 'Mr.', 'Miller', 'talented', 'actor', 'perhaps', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'better', 'suited', 'role', 'Mr', 'Silk', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'getting', 'hammier', 'days.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'last', 'film', 'photographer', 'Jean-Yves', 'Escoffier', 'theme', 'worthy', 'one', 'script', 'Nicholas', 'Meyer', 'curiously', 'hollow', 'sporadically', 'deeper', 'places', 'character', 's', 'too', 'busy', 'keeping', 'up', 'pace', 'trying', 'include', 'many', 'things', 'film', 'Strange', 'thing', 'Zuckerman', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'link', 'characters', 'least', 'effective', 'just', 'muddling', 'novel', 'world', 'Did', 'need', 'am', 'hugely', 'disappointed', 'result', 'especially', 'casting', 'admit', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'material', 'worth', 'discussing', 'Maybe', 'should', 'read', 'book', 'many', 'reviewers', 'would', 'say', 'watching', 'filmed', 'versions', 'beloved', 'books']",The Human Stain
816472,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B0001XAPX8,V. Marshall,"[3, 4]","I expected more from this film than it held. With the likes of Nicole Kidman, Anthony Hopkins, Ed Harris and Gary Sinise cast in this novel adaptation how could it fail?I understand that the novel written by Phillip Roth was difficult to adapt to the screen which may have led to the so-so effect of this film despite a brilliant cast. I found the film to be slow and straining to get through but good enough to watch. The story is very American centering on the acts of a man born as an African American but light skinned enough to pass for white. Because of the era that this character (Hopkins) grew up in his success or failure, sadly, could have been driven by the color of his skin so he chose to pretend to be white and disown his family instead. As a college dean many years later he makes a remark that is construed to be a racial slur and his life changes drastically. Following his wife's death and the loss of his position in life he begins an unlikely affair with an illiterate woman (Kidman) who is running from her own life in many ways. The characters are interesting and filled with depth but the film tends to show them in almost a shallow context.Nicole Kidman is very good as the 34 year old illiterate woman who has an affair with Hopkins who is much older. She is vulnerable and secretive and on the run from her husband who is abusive and controlling. Kidman scores highly in many of the scenes exhibiting a great deal of emotional effort in this role. Anthony Hopkins is typically brilliant as the troubled man of questionable race. Through flashbacks we meet the younger man that Hopkins plays and are able to grasp why he chose to betray his race for success. Ed Harris is superb as the stalking ex-Vietnam vet husband of Kidman. Harris's character is eerily unstable and although he only appears in a few scenes he manages to steal them nonetheless. The stabling force in all of this character study is Gary Sinise who is a writer that befriends Hopkins and eventually pieces the entire story together. All of the actors are excellent but somehow the film just doesn't cut it and is a bit of a strain to get through surprisingly.",2,An Unexpected Strain,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,2156,"['expected', 'more', 'film', 'held', 'likes', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'cast', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'how', 'could', 'fail', 'understand', 'novel', 'written', 'Phillip', 'Roth', 'was', 'difficult', 'adapt', 'screen', 'may', 'have', 'led', 'so-so', 'effect', 'film', 'brilliant', 'cast', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'slow', 'straining', 'get', 'good', 'enough', 'watch', 'story', 'very', 'American', 'centering', 'acts', 'man', 'born', 'African', 'American', 'light', 'skinned', 'enough', 'pass', 'white', 'era', 'character', 'Hopkins', 'grew', 'up', 'success', 'failure', 'sadly', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'driven', 'color', 'skin', 'so', 'chose', 'pretend', 'be', 'white', 'disown', 'family', 'instead', 'college', 'dean', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'remark', 'construed', 'be', 'racial', 'slur', 'life', 'changes', 'drastically', 'Following', 'wife', 'death', 'loss', 'position', 'life', 'unlikely', 'affair', 'illiterate', 'woman', 'Kidman', 'who', 'running', 'own', 'life', 'many', 'ways', 'characters', 'are', 'interesting', 'filled', 'depth', 'film', 'show', 'almost', 'shallow', 'context.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'very', 'good', '34', 'year', 'old', 'illiterate', 'woman', 'who', 'affair', 'Hopkins', 'who', 'much', 'older', 'vulnerable', 'secretive', 'run', 'husband', 'who', 'abusive', 'controlling', 'Kidman', 'highly', 'many', 'scenes', 'exhibiting', 'great', 'deal', 'emotional', 'effort', 'role', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'typically', 'brilliant', 'troubled', 'man', 'questionable', 'race', 'flashbacks', 'meet', 'younger', 'man', 'Hopkins', 'plays', 'are', 'able', 'grasp', 'why', 'chose', 'betray', 'race', 'success', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'superb', 'stalking', 'ex-Vietnam', 'vet', 'husband', 'Kidman', 'Harris', 'character', 'eerily', 'unstable', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'steal', 'nonetheless', 'stabling', 'force', 'character', 'study', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'who', 'writer', 'Hopkins', 'eventually', 'entire', 'story', 'together', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'somehow', 'film', 'just', ""n't"", 'cut', 'bit', 'strain', 'get', 'surprisingly']",The Human Stain

I think Gary Sinise is a fine choice for the role of Zuckerman, the novelist whose outside perspective tells  the story,The inner nexus of themes has to do with a number of important and archetypal issues that circle around each other, never reaching full closure.  To what extent can a person ""opt out"" of full participation in life, either because society or nature makes it hard? Who do you betray when you make that choice? Does society (or your employer) bear any responsibility? Sex and love, what is the relationship, finally and in the last analysis?The genius of Roth's novel is to raise such difficult questions; thankfully, the film does not shy away from them. Really, it's a praiseworthy effort to convey how complicated it is to negotiate the difficult passage between full participation and cowardly retirement from the business of life.
