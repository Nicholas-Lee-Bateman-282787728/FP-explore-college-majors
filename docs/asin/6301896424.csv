271840,AMHDDUINIIW1U,6301896424,Eugene B.,"[0, 1]","Most of the lengthy 2 hours and 37 minutes of this ""tribute"" is comprised of interviews and still photographs. Good luck trying to read the names of the people being interviewed. If you blink you'll miss it. Their names only appear on the screen at the bottom for about 2 seconds? What kind of a professional production company leaves the names up for 2 seconds. I couldn't even read the whole thing before the name was gone from the screen. As far as Michael's performances, his interviews, music videos, and music it's NO WHERE TO BE FOUND ON HERE. WHY NOT? The last 45 minutes of the documentary covers Michael's child molestation cases with video of him arriving and leaving the courthouse. The most interesting thing about this documentary is getting to hear from Michael's mother Katherine.I'am a longtime fan of Michael Jackson's and I love his music. He was a great humanitarian, human being, and a very talented musician. He is truly missed.Let's hope a more thorough documentary about his life using his interviews, his music, his music videos and his concert performances comes out sometime soon, becuase this one is not it.Here's an idea! It would also be nice to see ALL OF MICHAEL JACKSON'S MUSIC VIDEOS TOGETHER ON 1 BLU-RAY DISC. I know that would be a big seller!",2,NICE TRIBUTE - COULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER MR.

That is answered in this documentary along with other questions about how the Jackson's rose above Gary Indiana to become one of the greatest young acts in the Music Business.

271842,AQIJ3ZEEVCIKU,6301896424,Kaio,"[0, 0]","My husband and I just finished watching this documentary and wiped away the tears long enough to write this review. Now, if you've read any of my Michael Jackson reviews, then it should come as no surprise that I loved this documentary. No, not by default, just because I love Michael Jackson; but because this documentary is outstandingly put together and does this kind, talented man justice, without tabloid sensationalism.This documentary attempts to define Michael's enigma, that even his family, at times, struggles to comprehend. It paints a picture of a child destined to be a megastar, who masterfully steered his own destiny, until critical mass enveloped his shooting star, and even he struggled to keep control of the Super Nova called Fame that blasted him out of the stratosphere. This film gave us chills from the moment it started until the end credits rolled. There really are no words to describe how it made us feel. But somehow it captured the essence of Michael; the highs along with the lows, the joy along with the tragedy. At times, it was almost painful to watch, but we were riveted to say the least.Katherine Jackson herself, appears in this documentary, along with other family and dozens of close friends and colleagues. There's a great mix of historical footage and recent clips from the King's untimely passing; all of which gave me chills for different reasons. The recent footage is heartbreaking; the older stuff is both happily nostalgic and bittersweet. Ultimately, this is a poetic visual collage in tribute to a very unique and special human being indeed; the likes of which is sorely lacking in this world, now that he is gone. This is the part where cynics roll their eyes, but I bet not one of them has given as much to charity and the needy as Michael. If they had, they wouldn't be cynics. Spreading hate is all too easy, spreading love, however, is much more difficult and rarely appreciated. But remember, whenever you scoff with arrogance or dismissive laughter, you've done nothing to add kindness, compassion or love to this world.This documentary reminds us that Michael didn't just ""have it,"" he also ""got it,"" which is what set him apart and made him even more special than the sum of all his talents combined. Michael knew it wasn't enough to make #1 records, he knew to use that as a springboard to help others and make the world a better place. To treat all human beings as equals, and with kindness. To add ramps to Neverland for those of us that are disabled, long before it was legally required. To jump into a hot tub with a sick boy with AIDS, at a time when the medical community was afraid to even touch such patients. To say Michael Jackson was ahead of his time is trite. But this film shows how even those closest to him struggled to grasp his vision and world view. Michael saw further, reached higher, and pulled the world closer as those around him watched in awe. Luckily they knew well enough to help him attain the highest heights, even if they didn't always understand. But this film shows that sometimes, the yes-man mentality only worked to Michael's own detriment, and got those who dared to question ousted from his inner circle. But no matter how you look at it, Michael was the crown jewel of rare gems, indeed; shiny, sparkly and splendidly bright.David Gest did a fantastic job producing and compiling this documentary. Frankly, I'm surprised it didn't get a theatrical release. But it clearly took a man with his access and prior friendship with Michael to win the trust of the likes of Mrs. Jackson and so many others, and get them to participate in the making of this film. This isn't some hokey made for TV movie; this is top-shelf filmmaking at its best. I've been involved in a few small productions, so I have a tiny inkling of what it takes to put something like this together, and I must say, ""impressed"" doesn't express my feelings emphatically enough. This film masterfully touches all the right notes, and is worthy of a Best Documentary nomination, had it been released in theaters. It does not shy away from the tough subjects, nor does it unfairly railroad Michael, by allowing the darker elements of his story, overshadow the brilliance of his legacy.For those crying foul that this is ""just another money grab,"" it's pretty simple -- if you don't want to spend your money on this DVD, then don't. Personally, I like seeing Michael still hitting #1 and breaking records, even after his death; that's a fitting tribute even MJ would appreciate.I think this Blu Ray was well worth the purchase price, and I thank my kind husband for buying it for me. I can't wait to watch the added bonuses, and know I will watch this movie again and again; in fact, I'm planning on watching it a second time as soon as I post this review. But I wanted to come here and share my immediate impressions with anyone that may be on the fence about purchasing this film. Actually, this documentary is the perfect compliment to This Is It; offering somewhat of a bookend to the events which surrounded those rehearsals and concert film. In many ways, This Is It was lacking footage like this, but then, these are two distinctly different films.Bottom Line -- Michael Jackson: The Life Of An Icon, is a fitting tribute and has already become a treasured addition to my video library. I know I will watch it again and again, just like I'll read certain books about him and listen to his music again and again. Michael still manages to bring me happiness, illuminate my darkest days, lift my sprits and help me get through. What a gift -- what a man -- what a movie! A big thank you to the filmmakers who put this together, and the people who gave their time to appear in this film, especially you, Mrs. Jackson; much love and respect. Your strength and resolve is admirable, to say the very least. Bravo! Love you forever, Michael!... Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my Blu Ray! I don't want to keep Ms. Katherine waiting. And I'd much rather bury myself in this movie another 20 times, than see another minute of that fiasco called a trial going on right now, 20 minutes from home.",5,Gave Me Chills - Made Me Miss & Love

271844,A1DIM53U2RHG4W,6301896424,Matt Z.,"[7, 7]","Iridescent as Michael Jackson was and probably IS and will be (from his body of music and labors). This film did a great JUSTICE in humanizing a man who knew the weight and significance of MYSTERY (hence keeping most of his life private).Contrary to the most self aggrandizing ""Look at me, I'm the greatest Michael Jackson Fan ever, but never grew up with him"" tirades thinly disguised as reviews. These aren't weighted lies. David Guest even had the respect to keep anything approaching self aggrandizement out of the documentary/remembrances whatever you may wish to call it.If you watch the few ""cutting room floor"" extras, you'll know that his editing perspective kept much of the controversy to a low key (such as Rebbie talking about her albums, Katherine's statement omitted in the real film that Tito when starting in fact played guitar better than his father) I noted a reviewer suggested he made a bad impression of Elizabeth Taylor (divorced from the film maker) No. He just reiterated a PECULIARITY of their friendship. Michael goaded her out of her dungeon with a $250,000 smile.If anything this is a respectful presentation. Much of the substance the poor reviewers wish to declaim and deride is in fact truth. They didn't violate Michael's respect by talking about his private life in this instance, they never named names, they simply acknowledged what those in his inner circle knew. HE WASN'T GAY.They gave an accurate description of the public's curiosity over Michael's public seemingly ASEXUAL identity, and corroborated the fact that the public was ready to string him up once AN identity was presented by the opportunist accuser Evan Chandler (who killed himself in 2009 AND nearly killed his own child in 2003-5) and unfortunately that was an image that ultimately shrouded him in his later life, and also took it's toll on his psyche.I'm coming to the conclusion that the people who call this tabloid trash miss the point and significance of this film. Maybe they've jumped on the recent bandwagon and forgotten that Michael was a human being. I'm almost certain that Guest had reservations about doing this documentary but PROBABLY had stated it as a MISSION after hearing others rehash trash about his friend.In fact maybe this film isn't meant for younger fans. It's probably intended for us who grew up hearing and listening and reading about the man while he was alive. Get your head out of the sky and come back to Earth.They did a great justice interviewing many who grew up alongside Michael as well as many of his labelmates, songwriters and confidants. It was an even handed look at his CAREER (musically), his PERSONALITY and his GOALS. The segments dealing with the early J5 approach the matter with utmost respect and interview their original drummer and keyboardist much like any credible and thoroughly researched MUSIC DOCUMENTARY would do.True, a reviewer has suggested that the film is in two parts. The first focuses on childhood and the J5 and the second is Michael's solo career, which due to The Estate of Michael Jackson and Licensing, omits all of his output from Off The Wall onward. HOWEVER, this is not purely a musical documentary; the intent of the film was to ""set the story straight"".Another point someone barked about: WE ALL KNEW Michael was loaded at the MSG. It's sad but the public ridiculed this man and during that era of his life he canceled quite a few scheduled concerts. In this instance I'm certain he was DREADING working with his brothers again, mostly for all the dregs it would drudge up. This film CONCISELY shows that Michael was lampooned, hurt, pushed down but never relented.I'm kinda astounded that a malign, effacing, OPINIONATED review is made to sound like ""the most helpful review"", which will detract from this film's viewership. Shame on you.OF COURSE MICHAEL KEPT A COPY OF THE PAUL ANKA SONG he probably kept copies of all his work. HOWEVER, HE HAD NOT RELEASED IT. The reviewers' ears must be shut, it was all CLEARLY EXPLAINED in the film. After his death the estate had come across it in his private holding and had released it uknowingly thinking it was NEW.I'm surprised at how LAZY the general public is regarding READING these days. The fact that this film is poorly reviewed is indicative of ""judging a book by it's cover""The film is a labor of love. Even Thomas Mesereau is in it. Sure there are better documentaries that cover the extent of the Arvizo debacle, but this film is about MICHAEL. Hearing loving stories from some of the luminaries AND the UNSUNG writers and Bobby Taylor was rewarding in itself.If you're capable of thinking, and like Michael this is a documentary not to be missed.If you're an old miser aged 30-50 (usually) white guy who already made up his mind based on doing absolutely no research about the man, then this one isn't for you. You'll probably not have the capacity to comprehend much else other than the picture of Bubbles pointing at a picture of himself and Michael while you pull the lice from your back and groin (you public ape).If you're a new fan who thinks Michael was infallible, and NEVER had any cosmetic surgery, then this isn't for you.The film respects him BUT to the typical critics, this film omits his solo era much like a series like THE WONDER YEARS couldn't get released without a PLETHORA of MUSIC CLEARANCES. It would simply COST TOO MUCH.",4,"A great film of remembrances: 4 if you're an OLD fan, 3 if you're not.",1322784000,"12 2, 2011",2011,5390,"['Iridescent', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'was', 'probably',

271848,AH18JCRUKGUQP,6301896424,SuperReader,"[0, 0]","As many of the other reviewers said, this movie did show like a tabloid. A lot about the scandals that plagued him but I felt there wasn't a broad enough representation of the people who knew Michael. The only members of his family that spoke were his mother, Tito, and his sister Rebbie, whom I'd never heard of until now. I was really expecting more people from his life to give their perspectives.I did enjoy watching it though, for the photos and (limited)video footage. There wasn't hardly enough of those things, though. A lot of still shots from the Jackson 5 days but not enough video. I enjoy watching Michael perform and especially his performances as child but there was very little video, considering this is a documentary.",3,Very tabloid like but I did enjoy it,1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,735,"['many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'movie', 'did', 'show', 'tabloid', 'lot', 'scandals', 'plagued', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'broad', 'enough', 'representation', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Michael', 'only', 'members', 'family', 'spoke', 'were', 'mother', 'Tito', 'sister', 'Rebbie', 'whom', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'now', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'more', 'people', 'life', 'give', 'perspectives.I', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'photos', 'limited', 'video', 'footage', 'was', ""n't"", 'hardly', 'enough', 'things', 'though', 'lot', 'still', 'shots', 'Jackson', '5', 'days', 'not', 'enough', 'video', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Michael', 'perform', 'especially', 'performances', 'child', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'video', 'considering', 'documentary']",Michael Jackson: The Life of an Icon
