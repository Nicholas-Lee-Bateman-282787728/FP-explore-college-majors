It definitely was very low budget, but I do think that the movie is poorly lit on purpose to indicate that the characters are more or less in the dark about their direction.  It's a little unclear what Merrick, the object of Troy's affection, truly wants.  There's the possibility that Merrick is a user who gives Troy a tiny bit of what he wants because he needs someone to pay the rent.  Also, there's the possibility that the movie was saying that the atmosphere of small-town Canada makes a gay relationship more or less impossible.It's also possible that we don't know the answer to these questions because we can't hear the dialogue half the time.  I think this is really a nice film and the DVD should be re-released with subtitles.",4,"Moving, worthwhile story",1098835200,"10 27, 2004",2004,807,"[""'m"", 'going', 'agree', 'lot', 'what', 'been', 'said', 'film', 'definitely', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'do', 'think', 'movie', 'poorly', 'lit', 'purpose', 'indicate', 'characters', 'are', 'more', 'less', 'dark', 'direction', 'little', 'unclear', 'what', 'Merrick', 'object', 'Troy', 'affection', 'truly', 'possibility', 'Merrick', 'user', 'who', 'Troy', 'tiny', 'bit', 'what', 'someone', 'pay', 'rent', 'Also', 'possibility', 'movie', 'was', 'saying', 'atmosphere', 'small-town', 'Canada', 'gay', 'relationship', 'more', 'less', 'impossible.It', 'also', 'possible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'answer', 'questions', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'dialogue', 'time', 'think', 'really', 'nice', 'film', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 're-released', 'subtitles']",N/A

828470,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00029NM4A,Grady Harp,"[31, 33]","DENIED  is a very low budget, handmade film written, directed, edited and co-produced by one David Scott.  The actual film is fraught with technical problems: the sound track is so poor that it is almost impossible to hear much less understand what the actors are saying; the editing leaves long black gaps between scenes; the bulk of the film takes place at night with such minimal lighting that 'seeing' what is happening on screen is difficult at best.  Having said all that, the idea for the story is a solid one if not particularly well written.  Troy (played by the handsome and sensitive actor Lee Rhumohr - the camera loves this guy!) is a popular highschool jock with the world at his feet, girlfriends, popularity, and yet he is trapped by the knowledge that he is gay.  He secretly loves Merrick, a DJ/artist who is as superficial as they come and has a steady girlfriend but in rooming with Troy, Merrick engages in sex with Troy in the secrecy of night, never discussing it at dawn - the true closet case.  The story explores the psyche of Troy as he comes to grips with the fact that he wants a relationship with Merrick while Merrick just wants sex for sex sake, without the kissing and warmth Troy requests and needs.  How this is resolved is the point of the filmNow, you have to really work with this film to get the story, the dialogue, even the action. The writer/director/editor shows promise:  his story is solid, his characters are well drawn (and in the case of Troy, VERY well acted by Lee Rhumohr), and he has some interesting camera shots up his sleeve as well as an Indy flavor that hopefully he will cultivate.  In the end - with lots of struggle - I think the work is worth it, if for nothing else than the message and the introduction of a promising newcomer in Rhumohr.  With a bigger budget and more time to make this movie it could have been excellent.  The DVD has 'added footage' which amounts to little more than the practice kiss between the two characters.  A commentary from the director would have been very additive and helpful.",3,"Five Stars for Content Idea, One Star for Resulting Film",1091836800,"08 7, 2004",2004,2070,"['DENIED', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'handmade', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'edited', 'co-produced', 'one', 'David', 'Scott', 'actual', 'film', 'fraught', 'technical', 'problems', 'sound', 'track', 'so', 'poor', 'almost', 'impossible', 'hear', 'much', 'less', 'understand', 'what', 'actors', 'are', 'saying', 'editing', 'leaves', 'long', 'black', 'gaps', 'scenes', 'bulk', 'film', 'place', 'night', 'such', 'minimal', 'lighting', ""'seeing"", 'what', 'happening', 'screen', 'difficult', 'best', 'Having', 'said', 'idea', 'story', 'solid', 'one', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'written', 'Troy', 'played', 'handsome', 'sensitive', 'actor', 'Lee', 'Rhumohr', 'camera', 'guy', 'popular', 'highschool', 'jock', 'world', 'feet', 'girlfriends', 'popularity', 'yet', 'trapped', 'knowledge', 'gay', 'secretly', 'Merrick', 'DJ/artist', 'who', 'as', 'superficial', 'come', 'steady', 'girlfriend', 'rooming', 'Troy', 'Merrick', 'sex', 'Troy', 'secrecy', 'night', 'never', 'discussing', 'dawn', 'true', 'closet', 'case', 'story', 'psyche', 'Troy', 'grips', 'fact', 'relationship', 'Merrick', 'Merrick', 'just', 'sex', 'sex', 'sake', 'kissing', 'warmth', 'Troy', 'requests', 'needs', 'How', 'resolved', 'point', 'filmNow', 'have', 'really', 'work', 'film', 'get', 'story', 'dialogue', 'even', 'action', 'writer/director/editor', 'promise', 'story', 'solid', 'characters', 'are', 'well', 'drawn', 'case', 'Troy', 'VERY', 'well', 'acted', 'Lee', 'Rhumohr', 'interesting', 'camera', 'up', 'sleeve', 'as', 'well', 'Indy', 'flavor', 'hopefully', 'will', 'cultivate', 'end', 'lots', 'struggle', 'think', 'work', 'nothing', 'else', 'message', 'introduction', 'promising', 'newcomer', 'Rhumohr', 'bigger', 'budget', 'more', 'time', 'make', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'excellent', 'DVD', ""'added"", 'footage', 'little', 'more', 'practice', 'kiss', 'two', 'characters', 'commentary', 'director', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'additive', 'helpful']",N/A

The additional complications of girlfriends and poolhalls are a waste of time and the film is shot with a look and feel like a high school project. That's a shame, because this could have been so much more. As for the acting, Rhumohr's performance is solid and sincere and Austin is heartbreaking as the object of Rhumohr's affection.

Somehow, someone decided that throwing in bizarre cuts, strange noises, etc, would distract us from that problem.  Problem is, it distracts us from the story.

828474,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B00029NM4A,J. Martin,"[6, 6]","I suppose I can understand why many people dislike Denied, but my response to it is very much different. Poor lighting and sound do not kill a movie for me if there is something valuable in it to dig for through those defects, and there is much of value in Denied. Except for the sound and lighting (and possibly the music), it is an excellent movie, much better than 99% of gay movies.The screenplay is intelligent, subtle, compassionate, never clich&eacute;d, and often surprising. Characters talk in the sometimes disjointed way people really talk, switching from one point to another with no warning or explanation. That may be too much for viewers accustomed to the clean, logical, familiar, easy-to-follow way everyone talks in most movies but no one talks in real life. Every line in this movie rings true.The acting is some of the best I've ever seen in any movie, and certainly much better than in most gay movies. Lee Rumohr in the lead as Troy is especially good, but Matt Austin as Merrick is not far behind; and, in a much smaller role as Fowler, Troy's gentle but troubled fellow ex-jock, Matthew Finlason is amazing.I would almost recommend watching only the last half hour of the movie, from around the 1:05:00 mark (which unfortunately does not correspond with a chapter marker on the DVD - if you see a man standing alone on a lighted sports field at night, you're in the right place) to the very end. By that point, all the tedious stuff with Merrick's EXTREMELY tedious girlfriend Stacey is over, and all that's left is Troy's resolving his relationships with Fowler (which takes about 8 minutes) and then with Merrick (the last 20 minutes or so). That's when this movie really starts to shine, when it takes off and soars far above any other gay movie I can think of.But watching only the end would deprive you of its context, of understanding why Troy and his friends make the choices they make and how much those choices cost them. So here's what I recommend:If you can't stand working at watching a movie, if you prefer to have everything laid before you in order and easy to get without any work on your part, everything easy to see and every sound clear as a bell, then forget Denied. Stick with conventional, slickly professional and familiarly produced movies likeBilly's Hollywood Screen Kiss.If you love gay movies, particularly gritty, realistic movies about people like us, then give Denied a shot. But hold on through about an hour of relatively tedious stuff; it will make your enjoyment of the treasures at the end richer than it would be without it.But if you can't do that - if you can't or won't slog your way through an hour of tedium to get to a half hour of great beauty - then skip immediately to 1:05:00 and pay close attention, adjusting the video on your TV and replaying bits as necessary to get what people are saying. It will be well worth the effort. Even knowing nothing about the characters, seeing how they act and interact is profoundly satisfying in a way all movies should be but very few are.Denied truly is a diamond in the rough; if you're a diamond hunter like me, go for it, and don't give up until you're holding it in your grubby little hands.

Low budget films aren't a bad thing, in and of themselves, but when they're accompanied by truly *horrific* lighting, terrible sound (so bad that you can hardly understand the dialogue at times), then they shouldn't even have been made. Why? Well, if you can't see the characters, nor understand them, what's the point?There isn't a point. From the dialogue that I could understand, it wasn't particularly well written either.

The scenes in which an offscreen character speaks to him and he has to register his responses only in his face are excellent. Almost as good as Sean Connery's scene with an offscreen Christian Slater in The Name of the Rose. He expresses a variety of feelings clearly and naturally without exaggeration or artifice. Very good acting, specially for someone who might be tempted to let his good looks carry him. Matt Austin as Merrick is often a good match for him. The plot is a reversal of the gay trope of unrequited love between a narcissistic jock and a sensitive nerd. But these two guys gave it the ring of truth.
