I mean i know he's a dude in home alone and saved but then there's this and party monster and i think ""Is this Shlong, i'm watching or is this thing, this creature a Chic?Does anyone know?

There's just something magical about popping in an old classic movie and watching it.  I highly doubt movies that are made nowadays won't be as memorable.  It just brings back the kid in me.  While this movie isn't as good as Home Alone, it's about 98.9% close to it.  It's funny, sad and heartwarming.

I had asked Jesus into my heart 2 days before watching this movie, and thought things would be a breeze. Don't hold your breath Dan. It got even more confusing as I was trying to get with one of 2 girls at this time. One was the daughter of the woman who planted the seed for me to come to Jesus, and another one was a baby Christian who was in love with someone else. Well I went out with the girl of the woman, and I made so many mistakes that night. For starters I didn't know how to do a date properly. I made her pay for her ticket, and then she brought her cousin along, so I couldn't consider this to be a proper date anyway. It was a movie I really wasn't all that up to seeing anyway after Caulkin did ""The Good Son"", and the forgettable ""Nutcracker"" I felt his talent was spent as far as the movies would go. This had Danson as a Sam Malone wannabe. Apparently things didn't go too well with Whoopie, and he would try to get back into the groove rather quickly with doing another shallow character who was only concerned about himself. Well this was supposed to be a comedy, but it was far too serious. They would also use the Countors ""Do You Love Me"" for the umpteeenth millionth time, and what seemed like it was supposed to be a simple cute movie turned out into being a long-drawn out night not only for the movie, but also me. I learned alot that night, and it was stored away until now. Here are the lessons I want to pass onto you:For those about to date I salute you.1. Pay for you and your date. If your date brings someone along for protection use discretion, and know your budget you may be able to pay for them too which could, and I emphasize ""COULD"" get you some brownine points with the girl.2. There's no such thing as ""Dutch"" unless you 2 get serious and steady.3. Go with what your heart tells you. Don't be confused with what anyone tries to tell you. I know that morning that the woman was trying to say ""Back Off"", and if she doesn't respond it wasn't meant to be. I know that it's a risk, and believe me I feel that if I wasn't desparate I wouldn't have bothered with her too much after the first couple of times when she say ""Call Me"", but she'd not be home, and I would not hear from her again. However, begin to learn about discernment through books on dating, and from your peers.4. Give it up for getting that all important ""First Kiss"" It won't happen unless you do everything immaculate. Don't even think of getting her pants off either. Movies lie to you about that. If you tried, and this is coming from a man who gets frustrated quick Don't go away mad.5. Be sure to take care of yourself. I mean the car I drove was an eyesore, and because I didn't know how to take care of those things the girl actually took the dented part off because she was experienced with that; how humiliating. If you don't know how to do car repair you can learn online, or have a friend help you learn. Also...well this is one thing I did know about, and that was Come to your date reasonably clean.6. Of course thank the girl for going out with you.These are just 6 of the lessons I learned that night, and the movie well I almost forgot about it until recently. I just feel it's a long, drawn-out flick that was top heavy on the serious side of comedy. It was probably worthy of at least 2 razzies.",1,"This was an almost forgettable flick, but then I remembered",1160784000,"10 14, 2006",2006,3396,"['Saturday', 'August', '14th', '1994', 'was', 'still', 'rather', 'uncertain', 'future', 'had', 'asked', 'Jesus', 'heart', '2', 'days', 'watching', 'movie', 'thought', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'breeze', 'Do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'breath', 'Dan', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'confusing', 'was', 'trying', 'get', 'one', '2', 'girls', 'time', 'One', 'was', 'daughter', 'woman', 'who', 'planted', 'seed', 'come', 'Jesus', 'one', 'was', 'baby', 'Christian', 'who', 'was', 'love', 'someone', 'else', 'Well', 'went', 'out', 'girl', 'woman', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'mistakes', 'night', 'starters', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'date', 'properly', 'made', 'pay', 'ticket', 'then', 'brought', 'cousin', 'along', 'could', ""n't"", 'consider', 'be', 'proper', 'date', 'anyway', 'was', 'movie', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'up', 'seeing', 'anyway', 'Caulkin', 'did', 'Good', 'Son', 'forgettable', 'Nutcracker', 'felt', 'talent', 'was', 'spent', 'as', 'far', 'movies', 'would', 'go', 'had', 'Danson', 'Sam', 'Malone', 'wannabe', 'Apparently', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'well', 'Whoopie', 'would', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'groove', 'rather', 'quickly', 'doing', 'shallow', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'only', 'concerned', 'Well', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'comedy', 'was', 'far', 'too', 'serious', 'would', 'also', 'use', 'Countors', 'Do', 'Love', 'Me', 'umpteeenth', 'millionth', 'time', 'what', 'seemed', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'simple', 'cute', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'being', 'long-drawn', 'out', 'night', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'also', 'learned', 'alot', 'night', 'was', 'stored', 'away', 'now', 'Here', 'are', 'lessons', 'want', 'pass', 'date', 'salute', 'you.1', 'Pay', 'date', 'date', 'someone', 'protection', 'use', 'discretion', 'know', 'budget', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'pay', 'too', 'could', 'emphasize', 'COULD', 'get', 'brownine', 'points', 'girl.2', 'such', 'thing', 'Dutch', '2', 'get', 'serious', 'steady.3', 'Go', 'what', 'heart', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'confused', 'what', 'anyone', 'tell', 'know', 'morning', 'woman', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'Back', 'Off', ""n't"", 'respond', 'was', ""n't"", 'meant', 'be', 'know', 'risk', 'believe', 'feel', 'was', ""n't"", 'desparate', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'bothered', 'too', 'much', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'when', 'say', 'Call', 'Me', ""'d"", 'not', 'be', 'home', 'would', 'not', 'hear', 'again', 'However', 'begin', 'learn', 'discernment', 'books', 'dating', 'peers.4', 'Give', 'up', 'getting', 'important', 'First', 'Kiss', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'do', 'everything', 'immaculate', 'Do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'getting', 'pants', 'Movies', 'lie', 'tried', 'coming', 'man', 'who', 'frustrated', 'quick', 'Do', ""n't"", 'go', 'away', 'mad.5', 'Be', 'sure', 'take', 'care', 'mean', 'car', 'drove', 'was', 'eyesore', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'take', 'care', 'things', 'girl', 'actually', 'took', 'dented', 'part', 'was', 'experienced', 'how', 'humiliating', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'do', 'car', 'repair', 'can', 'learn', 'online', 'have', 'friend', 'help', 'learn', 'Also', 'well', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'know', 'was', 'Come', 'date', 'reasonably', 'clean.6', 'course', 'thank', 'girl', 'going', 'out', 'you.These', 'are', 'just', '6', 'lessons', 'learned', 'night', 'movie', 'well', 'almost', 'forgot', 'recently', 'just', 'feel', 'long', 'drawn-out', 'flick', 'was', 'top', 'heavy', 'serious', 'side', 'comedy', 'was', 'probably', 'worthy', 'least', '2', 'razzies']",N/A
