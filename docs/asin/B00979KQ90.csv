Dan Dailey plays with considerable skill and charm a somewhat successful band leader derailed by  the 1929 economic collapse. Jeanne Crain is his much younger and loving wife. Oscar Levant hangs around delivering  brilliant piano work and acerbic charm. Underlining the light presentation is a set of core beliefs encompassing hope, hard work, and good old American know how.

1586751,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00979KQ90,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 3]","You Were Meant for Me is a fine motion picture with some really rather good musical numbers thrown in for a great effect! The acting is most convincing and I liked the choreography, cinematography and the background musical score. True, one or two of the background sets looked like Hollywood sets and not the real thing but this is a minor qualm; overall this film is very well done and the storyline held my attention every step of the way.When the movie begins, we see Chuck Arnold (Dan Dailey) and His Sophisticates giving one of their usual fine performances in Bloomington, Illinois. In the crowd is Peggy Mayhew (Jeanne Crain) who is out on a date with a guy she really doesn't have any feelings for. When Peggy wins a raffle she gets to come up onstage to collect her prize and the chemistry between Peggy and Chuck begins almost instantaneously! They enjoy each other's company so much that Peggy actually follows Chuck and his band to Peoria the next day and it certainly isn't long after that that they are married much to the shock of Peggy's mother Cora (Selena Royle) and father Andrew (Percy Kilbride). Peggy also gets to know Oscar Hoffman (Oscar Levant), the guy who helps Chuck with his bookings on the road.However, happiness for Chuck and Peggy doesn't last long. Life on the road with Chuck and his band is unfamiliar to Peggy; she yearns for some quality time alone with her husband who begins to neglect her for his work. What makes matters far worse is the very unexpected stock market crash of 1929 which happens only two months after Chuck and Peggy have been married! The way they and the rest of the family handles this economic crisis and the resulting cancelled bookings for the band is certainly interesting; and we see Oscar's way of handling the problem as well. There's more to the plot that I won't write about so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did and the rest of the film shows how all of the issues play out.Look also for a solid performance by Herbert Anderson as Eddie. Barbara Lawrence does a great job of playing Louise Crain.You Were Meant for Me is a must-have film for fans of the actors in it and people who enjoy dramas with nicely done musical numbers will not be disappointed.",5,"romance, nostalgia and some very good musical numbers",1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,2241,"['Were', 'Meant', 'Me', 'fine', 'motion', 'picture', 'really', 'rather', 'good', 'musical', 'numbers', 'thrown', 'great', 'effect', 'acting', 'most', 'convincing', 'liked', 'choreography', 'cinematography', 'background', 'musical', 'score', 'True', 'one', 'two', 'background', 'looked', 'Hollywood', 'sets', 'not', 'real', 'thing', 'minor', 'qualm', 'overall', 'film', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'storyline', 'held', 'attention', 'step', 'way.When', 'movie', 'see', 'Chuck', 'Arnold', 'Dan', 'Dailey', 'Sophisticates', 'giving', 'one', 'usual', 'fine', 'performances', 'Bloomington', 'Illinois', 'crowd', 'Peggy', 'Mayhew', 'Jeanne', 'Crain', 'who', 'out', 'date', 'guy', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'feelings', 'When', 'Peggy', 'raffle', 'come', 'up', 'onstage', 'collect', 'prize', 'chemistry', 'Peggy', 'Chuck', 'almost', 'instantaneously', 'enjoy', 'other', 'company', 'so', 'much', 'Peggy', 'actually', 'Chuck', 'band', 'Peoria', 'next', 'day', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'long', 'are', 'married', 'much', 'shock', 'Peggy', 'mother', 'Cora', 'Selena', 'Royle', 'Andrew', 'Percy', 'Kilbride', 'Peggy', 'also', 'know', 'Oscar', 'Hoffman', 'Oscar', 'Levant', 'guy', 'who', 'Chuck', 'bookings', 'road.However', 'happiness', 'Chuck', 'Peggy', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'Life', 'road', 'Chuck', 'band', 'unfamiliar', 'Peggy', 'quality', 'time', 'alone', 'husband', 'who', 'neglect', 'work', 'What', 'matters', 'far', 'worse', 'very', 'unexpected', 'stock', 'market', 'crash', '1929', 'only', 'two', 'months', 'Chuck', 'Peggy', 'have', 'been', 'married', 'way', 'rest', 'family', 'economic', 'crisis', 'resulting', 'cancelled', 'bookings', 'band', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'see', 'Oscar', 'way', 'handling', 'problem', 'as', 'well', 'more', 'plot', 'wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'so', 'can', 'watch', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'rest', 'film', 'how', 'issues', 'play', 'out.Look', 'also', 'solid', 'performance', 'Herbert', 'Anderson', 'Eddie', 'Barbara', 'Lawrence', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Louise', 'Crain.You', 'Were', 'Meant', 'Me', 'must-have', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'dramas', 'nicely', 'done', 'musical', 'numbers', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed']",You Were Meant for Me
