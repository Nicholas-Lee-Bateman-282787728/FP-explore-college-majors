1681447,A3BMUBUC1N77U8,B00GSTHCWQ,ahoffoss,"[7, 8]","This movie takes us on the journey as four (yes FOUR (4),...not 5 as EVERY synopsis says) psychology students are randomly grouped (by name) together to perform an experiment dealing with ESP.  They are tasked with staying awake for 48 hours and the test must be done at a secluded location.  One of the students, Becket (Taylor Core) just happens to have an abandoned home that perfectly meets the requirements set forth, so they venture on.Let me be honest,...this house it right smack in the middle of LA.  It shows the iconic HOLLYWOOD sign in the background from time to time, so wouldn't you think her parents would have torn this place down and sold it or something by now?!  I mean, I live in Louisiana, so I can't exactly say would the land would go for, but really, it's gotta be a pretty chunk of change, don't you think?  Also, who's paying the bills on this place?  It definitely has electricity and water, and since they turn on the furnace for heat, I'm assuming that is gas as well?  I could be wrong, but why would you keep the utilities on in this place?  Doesn't seem right.  Not to mention the property taxes they probably get stuck with every year?!  But  back to the review......They all arrive at the house for the experiment and this is when we get our first indication that none of the students are friends.  Eliot (Ryan Donowho) as apparently spent some time setting the place up for all the requirements that this experiment is going to take.  Multiply cameras have been installed throughout the place and 4-5 monitors have been set up in the ""control room"".  Apparently Eliot has some sort of ties with ghost hunters of the 1920's, because the equipment all seems to have come from that time period.  Even the computer they're using looks like some sort of laptop from the 1970's.  How it transmits video, I have no idea?!  But everything is set and they all group together to introduce themselves and begin the experiment.Becket begins by pulling out a camcorder and filming each person.  Graves (Toby Hemingway) takes this time to be the ""cool guy"" and talk a bunch of nonsense, while Lucky (Rumor Willis) uses it as an opportunity to get baked out of her mind.  Hipster, Eliot is completely appalled at how Graves and Lucky are acting and attempts to talk smooth with Becket.Again, I have to break in here.  I know NOTHING about cocaine, but from what I've heard, this stuff can be quite pricey.  Lucky CONTINUOUSLY pulls bags of the stuff from her purse (or whatever it is she's carrying with her).  It would seem to me that there is approximately $100K worth of the stuff lying around.  But again, I'm no expert.As Lucky continues to get high they begin the experiment.  Graves goes first.  They strap some sort of welders goggles and some ""Beats by Dre"" style headphones on his head and go to work.  Now this is one place I got confused.  They were supposed to see a card on the computer screen and he was supposed to say what they card was through ESP?  I'm probably wrong, because they would say the name of the card, then he'd repeat it back to them?  Regardless, something else happens and Graves gets freaked and he runs off and forces Becket to take a turn.  During her part, something begins to happen to her and she freaks out.  Afterwards they all find themselves back in the, let's call it a common room, where they proceed to take MASSIVE amounts of cocaine, pot, and alcohol and start making a sex tape.  Yes,...you read that correctly.  It totally comes out of nowhere, but somewhere in the middle, Lucky passes out and somehow, Eliot and Becket find themselves up in one of the bedrooms.  You can imagine what is taking place, but then Eliot sees something in the mirror and proceeds to flip out.  Another question I had to ask myself was:  How in the world can Becket, a girl that has NEVER done cocaine, possibly stay completely alert, while a junkie like Lucky passes out?  Just another inconsistency.The movie continues with them doing the experiments after awakening from their haze.  It's pretty much a continuation of their work previous to the orgy.  Graves and Becket both take turns again and something happens to both AGAIN.  It is during this time that we know the ""twist"" that we'd expected from the get-go IS, in fact, what we thought it was.  I won't ruin it for you, because you might want to see for yourself, but the involved characters HAD to know.  Considering what happened, they would have been like 10-11 years old?The reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of a single star is the fact that it was filmed well.  It was, at the very least a quality produced indie title.  The acting was good, the set was ok, but the story was pretty bad.  The ending was even worse, because the cops come out of NO WHERE?!Final Verdict:  PASS!  It's nowhere near good enough for the time it takes to watch.If you found my review to be helpful please let me know by clicking the ""yes"" button below so I feel like I'm doing something right.
