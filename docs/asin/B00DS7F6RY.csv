After Lifetime's little disaster, I heard there would be another version and I wasn't very sure about it, but everything changed when I heard that Sofia Coppola would direct it, and I immediately knew it would be amazing.The film has amazing actors (especially Israel Broussard and Emma Watson, and in this movie, she proves that she can play any role besides the ""good girl role""; this time a bimbo), the way the story is told (not as cheesy as the Lifetime version), this one is darker, but lighter at the same time, and more appealing for teenagers. I just wish they would had shown more than the robberies (the film has like 4 or 5 robbery scenes, which takes a lot of minutes off the film, instead of showing us how their life was on High School, or when they did something else besides shopping and clubbing), the psychological sides of other characters besides Marc would had been amazing. But what makes this movie so special, is that the story is not about stealing stuff from celebrities, but also the things we would do for acceptance and to feel like we're part of something.Overall, if you enjoyed Spring Breakers, you will like the Bling Ring, and don't listen to bad reviews, it's awesome.",4,Fame has its price,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",2013,1232,"['totally', 'loved', 'movie', 'Lifetime', 'little', 'disaster', 'heard', 'would', 'be', 'version', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'sure', 'everything', 'changed', 'when', 'heard', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'would', 'direct', 'immediately', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'amazing.The', 'film', 'amazing', 'actors', 'especially', 'Israel', 'Broussard', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'movie', 'can', 'play', 'role', 'good', 'girl', 'role', 'time', 'bimbo', 'way', 'story', 'told', 'not', 'as', 'cheesy', 'Lifetime', 'version', 'one', 'darker', 'lighter', 'same', 'time', 'more', 'appealing', 'teenagers', 'just', 'would', 'had', 'shown', 'more', 'robberies', 'film', '4', '5', 'robbery', 'scenes', 'lot', 'minutes', 'film', 'instead', 'showing', 'how', 'life', 'was', 'High', 'School', 'when', 'did', 'something', 'else', 'shopping', 'clubbing', 'psychological', 'sides', 'other', 'characters', 'Marc', 'would', 'had', 'been', 'amazing', 'what', 'movie', 'so', 'special', 'story', 'not', 'stealing', 'stuff', 'celebrities', 'also', 'things', 'would', 'do', 'acceptance', 'feel', ""'re"", 'part', 'something.Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Spring', 'Breakers', 'will', 'like', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'bad', 'reviews', 'awesome']",N/A

I am a fan of Sofia Coppola, and I have to place this film in the context of her work.  These kids are the entitled offspring of the American autocracy, the rich.  Their aspirations are the &#34;stuff&#34; of the richer and the famous.  They have come of age as the peers of Paris Hilton whose claim to fame is in fact fame.  In taking her belongings, they become a step closer to her notoriety.  When the bill comes due, they point to each other as the leader.  Hate the world that created these kids, but do not turn away.  If we do not understand them, they will haunt us.  If we do face their reality, it mandates us to change.Just as in &#34;Marie Antoinette&#34;, this movie has major &#34;stuff porn&#34;.

1660898,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00DS7F6RY,Andrew Ellington,"[24, 37]","Innocence lost due to the struggling life of stardom is something that Sophia Coppola likes to explore.  Maybe it's her background, being brought up in a household that revolved around the arts and was always smothered by fame.  In fact, `Somewhere', her least well known film, is said to be an autobiography of sorts (with regards to her childhood with her father).  Yes, fame, fortune and the emptiness that comes along with it is something that Coppola has staked her career on.  From the solemn romanticism of `Lost in Translation' to the flamboyant ostracism of `Marie Antoinette' to the quiet understanding of `Somewhere', Coppola has exploited nearly every facet of fame and the disastrous effects it has on those caught up in it.With `The Bling Ring', Coppola moves away from the more intimate aspects of fame and dissects the dangers that that very drug has, not on those who have it by on those who want it.  One could call to mind the fascination Coppola flirted with in her very first film, `The Virgin Suicides'.  In her debut she immortalized average girls by focusing on the neighborhood boys caught up in an obsession of sorts with their very being.  Here, Coppola takes that obsession and kicks it up a few dozen notches, using the real life story of a group of kids who took their media fueled celebrity obsessions to the extreme.I think we've all seen the videos.  They circulated YouTube a few years back, and E! made it a point of following these girls and their stories, especially the outspoken Nicki Moore, and so when we see something like `The Bling Ring' it is easy to assume that this is nothing more than exploitation of the very thing that motivated these young women (and young man) to engage in such reckless and offensive behavior.  You are what you eat, and glamming up celebrity in this way can be seen as adding to the problem.Watch the trailer and keep on thinking that way if you want, but watch the movie and find something very different.What I love about Sophia Coppola, the director, is that she has a nuanced way of etching out so much truth in the details.  You can't help but feel the delicate manner in which she sets up her scenes, even the more fast paced and seemingly flamboyant ones.  She understands how to mold each scene so as to find something deeper below the shallow exteriors.  She's been doing this for years.  Watch `Marie Antoinette' and watch Coppola find so many shades of color in a rather straightforward storyline.  Here is no exception.  While scenes fly by with teens engaging in parties, drugs, drinking, robberies; all of which laced with this feeling of cool or `fun', one can't ignore the obvious drain of innocence and the compelling character study (personal at that) that Sophia delivers to us.Let's be honest.  We are obsessed, as a culture, with celebrities.  They are superior to us.  We watch them with baited breath.  We want what they wear, we eat what they eat, we fantasize about them sexually, we watch where they go, what they watch, who the listen to, who they date, where they vacation, what they feed their children, how they dress their children.  The list goes on and on and quite frankly none of us can escape it if we wanted to.  What is more disheartening is that this has trickled down into a generation of teenagers (and younger) who want nothing more than to be famous.  The Paris Hilton's and the clutter of talentless kids from shows about being rich (much like `The Hills') has bred a world full of people who feel that they don't have to contribute anything or merit to be successful and have legions of fans, and the sad truth is that they are right.  What I found so interesting about Coppola's `expos&eacute;' so-to-speak is that she didn't stop there.  No, she didn't rest at merely singling out the media obsessions that provoked these kids, but she touches upon something even darker and more disturbing.As young Marc mentions on the outset of the film, people today are drawn to the Bonnie and Clyde, the dangerous.  More than being famous and being rich, people are fascinated with those who break the laws that confine us.  As we meet young Rebecca we see a young woman not in want of anything and yet she is a compulsorily stealer.  She can't help it.  She checks cars, she snags purses, she breaks into empty houses and eventually she allows her clear obsession with the stars to force her into trying to attain their life, if even just for a minute.  It isn't always about the `things' but about the places.  Watch the way she can't leave Paris's house until she gets a picture using her phone.  Watch the way she ignites with glee over sharing this moment with her friends, drinking Paris's booze and trying on her clothes.  She takes delight in their knowledge of her actions, because she wasn't afraid to do the dirty and because of her they are all having fun.But notice how easy it was for her to shut it all off, which speaks to an almost darker truth.Yes, `The Bling Ring' is fun.  I smiled at the sequences and the way the film's depictions of teen rebelliousness was framed (great cinematography by the late Harris Savides) and the use of music (Coppola is a queen at that) is inspired and adds so many layers of edgy abandon to the film.  I relished in Emma Watson's glorious reenactment of Nicki's `put on' persona and I ogled the eye candy (both the bodies and the clothing) and yet leaving the theater I'm left with a deepened sadness for the state of our society as a whole.  For me, `The Bling Ring' could be this year's `The Social Network', a film that captures the state of an era, a people, a generation.  It casts light on the current pursuit of happiness, or what the media projects that happiness to be.While Sophia has clearly shown us that fame isn't always what it appears, she masterfully shows us that the pursuit of that said `fame' can be an even uglier, lonelier and more crippling experience altogether.",5,The death of our youth...,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",2013,5946,"['Innocence', 'lost',

The film easily opens itself to Marxist, Feminist, and, naturally, Red Feminist readings. It seems to speak at once to our fascination with wealth, fame, and how we identify people with things external or separate from themselves (i.e. their patterns of consumption, their possessions, their bodies, the list goes on). Through this lens we may understand the films brief flirtations with cross dressing to have, perhaps, a deeper meaning. These are not necessarily mere layers to a character, but allusions to cultural conditions.The cinematography is beautiful and inventive, though does seem to alternate between subtly enhancing the story and various elements within it, and calling attention to itself. This is not to say that either is poorly executed, but the film does obtain an odd rhythm from these decisions. Despite that it is one of the few films in recent memory that has, in my mind, successfully integrated the elements of the digital age.It is almost more compelling  watching this on a laptop and seeing facebook posts and watching  the TMZ logo flash across the screen as though one had clicked a video on their site and it had just loaded.Coppola, I think, is held back by her emphasis on a documentary approach. Emma Watson delivers the best performance, though that's not to say the others aren't doing a good job, rather her character obtains a greater depth because we see more of her interactions with other characters.

I was looking for the real story some explanation, insight or at least a statement that shed light on these lost ones of their generation who worship celebrity and stuff more than their own well being. I thought perhaps it would show the addiction to heroin, cocaine and alcohol that fueled some of their plights and what that really looks like. Unfortunately what I watched was a recap superficial and insensitive. The cinematography was beautiful but a little choppy. Emma Watson stood out but was not convincing. Leslie Mann's performance was dead on the character from the reality show but even the reality show portrayed a very superficial story with no insight except what could not be glossed over. (the utter adolescent view of superficial reality)  It was difficult to remember who was who. The reality show Pretty Wild was more compelling and true than this movie. There was a pathetic lost immature quality that the film did not even attempt.These kids were on the outside and like many adolescents believed if they had the right stuff it was their ticket to utter coolness.This movie was not satirical it was superficialIt was not funny but confusingThey used exact moments from the reality show but they did not slap you in the face just seemed stupid. The absurdity of the reality was not used and was the very basis for any satire.No one was a real whole complex human but instead superficial bad kids with no lasting memorable characteristics beyond the stereotypes. Coppola was out of her realm, she has never been anything but an insider and was not able to conjure sensitivity beyond stereotypes of the characters OR even those they took from. She told a story that had no depth or understanding one that could be gathered from the pages of TMZ and be more interesting. There is so much more that could of have been done with this story. It could have gone the superficial route and been fun and voyeuristic and like a party you were guiltily partaking in but it was not.Bottom Line this is a compelling story but Coppola did not do it justice.

There's a bracing mostly hip-hop soundtrack that pulses. The works, cinematography, direction, editing, pacing and general storytelling are all top-notch and basically seamless. It's the based-on-true-events story of a group of upper-middle class kids that brazenly entered the homes of celebrities they idolize and robbed them while the owners were away at well publicized events. They act as if they're shopping and that it is some how acceptable and even cool. It's not Leopold and Loeb but it's a fun and compelling ride.

Some may think this film can't decide what it wants to be, which I can understand, however I don't think it takes any of the quality away. If anything, the pacing can be awkward. There are some great comedic parts, such as Rebecca (Chang) trying to steal Paris Hilton's dog, breaking and entering with no qualms, and Emma Watson's perfect portrayal or Alexis Neiers.As a cautionary tale, it does show that teens are getting better at being 'out of control'. Prescription drugs are the go-to drugs for many, there is a lot of cocaine use throughout the film. Clearly these teens are lost, amoral, vapin, vain and selfish. I think that Coppola allows us to see who they really are; yes they're not the most likable clique of teens, but most can identify with wanting to be 'a part of the Hollywood lifestyle'.Playing almost as a docudrama, the film is visceral and has an art-house feel to it.

If you need more depth, it is in the book.  But Sofia Coppolla nails an essential sub culture in Los Angeles today which is young people who aspire to be the people who are famous for being famous.  Since they can't be them, they steal from them instead.One initial big difference between the movie and reality is that the actors portraying the real people are better looking, especially the Asian ringleader girl.  As you see the film versions walk down the street in all of their stolen stuff, they do look as good as their celebrity counterparts.  But of course this is because they ARE the real thing.  Emma Watson, for one, is a much bigger celebrity than Paris Hilton can ever hope to be (because Watson actually has talent).  I wonder if it wouldn't have been a better idea to use more ordinary looking real people.  I would have liked to see all of the bling NOT transforming them into beautiful people.  One exception is that I think the real world guy involved from the very beginning is even better looking than the actor playing him.Perhaps it is because I am an older person that I also found the parenting, or really lack thereof, so fascinating.  Most of these kids were from divorced or blended families.  There were people living in these households who were also rather temporary members whether as pseudo kids or pseudo parents.  There is also no supervision of these young people whatsover.  They can go out any night of the week, party all night, drink, take drugs, etc.,This is not on the same level as Coppolla's best known work LOST IN TRANSLATION.

For example, people left keys in their unlocked cars. They also left drug, cash, and credit cards there. Some did not even lock their house doors. One victim even left the house key under the door mat.After the burglary, the teenage were shown doing drugs, trying on the stolen clothes, selling them, partying in famous bars in Los Angeles and burglarizing again.

1660936,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00DS7F6RY,Darren,"[0, 0]","Under the cool, unsentimental eye of Sofia Coppola, this ridiculous true-life L.A. story from a few years ago about fantastically wealthy teenagers who robbed the homes of even more fantastically wealthy celebrities becomes rather unwelcome social commentary, if the reviews here are any guide.  The movie tells us nothing that we don't already know: that our culture has become thoroughly obsessed with celebrity and commercialism.  Big whoop, but what makes this superior is that Coppola refrains from sympathizing with or condemning these characters, and she refrains from that worst Hollywood cliche of dragging in some Voice of Reason or a Moral Anchor to help us understand that what these kids were doing was wrong.  One would think that we'd be grateful for these mercies, but the reviewers here are howling in outrage that those elements are missing in Coppola's picture.  Well, a little googling reveals that the cable network Lifetime beat Coppola to the punch with this story -- perhaps Lifetime's version provides the Standing Sadly At The Mirror Scene, the One Engaged Parent, the Tearful Recounting of Child Abuse, the Doomed Romance that everyone here seems to be clamoring for.  Go check that one out and get back to us.  Meanwhile, you might want to refrain from telling Sofia Coppola how to make a movie.  Hate the message all you like, but don't shoot the messenger.For Coppola is doing what authors like Bret Easton Ellis do: taking a snapshot of an extreme milieu, and implicating us as indirectly participating accessories.  And that, I think, is the subconscious reason for audiences' rejection of this movie.  To read that there's no character &#34;development&#34; here is pretty irritating.  Consider the movie's central relationship between gorgeous and popular Katie Chang and depressed and sexually confused Israel Broussard.  Chang's first words to Broussard are a friendly, &#34;Hey! New kid!&#34;  Already she's leveraging against his vulnerability as a new student at their school.  Knowing that he has no friends there, she invites him to an afternoon at the beach after school with another cool girl.  Suddenly he's part of something exclusive ... and Chang, having engineered it, uses it against him throughout the picture.  Broussard becomes in short order the lackey for her career in exciting crime that she has always been looking for.  And while Chang grows more brazen, Broussard becomes more entirely hers.  In the early robberies, he can get away with telling Chang, &#34;Let's get out of here, come on!&#34;  Late in the film, after another of his warnings, she finally tells him, &#34;Quit whining, Marc, you sound like a little b---h!&#34;  Which, ultimately, he is.Cleverly, Coppola interposes real footage of Lindsey Lohan's various arrests, and other celebrities in trouble, with the trouble the kids are getting into -- it blurs the line between the celebrities getting robbed and the robbers.  In fact, one of the early robberies occurs at the home of one of Broussard's friends whose family is away in Jamaica: the friend's house is the most spectacular in the movie, more intimidating than the cheesy Paris Hilton house or the rather dull Orlando Bloom house.  The robbers are as rich as the robbed.  The question becomes not so much &#34;Why are such wealthy kids robbing these celebrity homes?&#34; as &#34;Why are all of these people so rich?&#34;  Coppola spends a great deal of time in Paris Hilton's home (I'm assuming it was a set, but who knows?), where we see pillows with her face sewn into them, a small &#34;nightclub&#34; replete with stripper's pole, and tasteless faux-Florentine marble pillars, and we can only wonder what on earth this woman has done to deserve such wealth, wealth that would astonish the most luxurious goats'-milk-bathing Roman Emperor.  The movie's final, nervous question is, &#34;Is what the Bling Ring did really a crime?&#34;  Something has probably gone seriously wrong with a society that turns entertainers like Paris Hilton into such parasitical potentates.  Yes, parasitical, because after all, much of Paris Hilton's wealth has been sucked from the raw hands and red fingers of the maids who clean the cruddy rooms of Hilton hotels.

Sure, it portrays our youth culture as the pathetic beast spawn of consumerism it is, but it also seems to be more of a ""how-to"" or ""watch out"" message to the Hollywood elite.  Sure, consequences are doled out by the time the credits roll, but did you know that the real subjects of this film, the kids who went on the crime spree, GOT PAID by the filmmakers to serve as consultants?!  They did, which is outrageous.  So not only did these little self-absorbed brats go on a crime spree and get the national attention they wanted - they even got paid by the same class of people they were ripping off.

Let's start with the CONS: Within 15 minutes into the film, I really wished they would have chosen stronger leads than Israel Broussard and Katie Chang. I was really torn trying to make sense of why she chose them as her leads when they were the weakest characters of the film. Yet, the upside of this was that it was believable. It felt real to have seemingly normal people acting.The PROS: Emma Watson was the obvious star, she stood out as a professional next to the rest of them and her character, Nicki, was hilariously shallow, so much that her behavior and lines always shined in comparison to the rest. She was the most interesting to watch. I disagree with critics and other reviews before me that label this film boring, the whole thing caught my attention though the first scene when Marc and Rebecca meet is the reason I called them weak actors. It wasn't boring at all, if you can milk all the superficial glamor and see it as the dark mocking comedy that it really is, then you can really appreciate the flashy montages, the famous guest appearances, the hip-hop and drugs. THIS is all to serve a purpose and that is why you can't just see it has snobby rich kids flaunting there stolen jewels and cash in Facebook photos. This is all in the name of art to tell the story of how consumed society is with this lifestyle, that people are willing to go to the immoral illegal depths just to get a glimpse of what it is to live like a celebrity. To watch this, you don't have to agree with what they did! In fact, the point is the exact opposite, Sofia is practically making fun of the whole situation. The bottom line is that it's ridiculous but there is some truth in these kids behavior because I knew girls like this growing up and as sickening as it is...it's great to know that there's been a movie made just to make them look like the air-headed girls they really are.",4,"""I Want To Lead A Country One Day For All I Know""",1381017600,"10 6, 2013",2013,1976,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'summarize', 'been', 'done', 'will', 'give', 'whole-hearted', 'opinion', 'Let', 'start', 'CONS', '15', 'minutes', 'film', 'really', 'wished', 'would', 'have', 'chosen', 'stronger', 'leads', 'Israel', 'Broussard', 'Katie', 'Chang', 'was', 'really', 'torn', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'why', 'chose', 'leads', 'when', 'were', 'weakest', 'characters', 'film', 'upside', 'was', 'was', 'believable', 'felt', 'real', 'have', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'people', 'acting.The', 'PROS', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'was', 'obvious', 'star', 'stood', 'out', 'professional', 'next', 'rest', 'character', 'Nicki', 'was', 'hilariously', 'shallow', 'so', 'much', 'behavior', 'lines', 'always', 'shined', 'comparison', 'rest', 'was', 'most', 'interesting', 'watch', 'disagree', 'critics', 'other', 'reviews', 'film', 'boring', 'whole', 'thing', 'caught', 'attention', 'first', 'scene', 'when', 'Marc', 'Rebecca', 'meet', 'reason', 'called', 'weak', 'actors', 'was', ""n't"", 'boring', 'can', 'milk', 'superficial', 'glamor', 'see', 'dark', 'mocking', 'comedy', 'really', 'then', 'can', 'really', 'appreciate', 'flashy', 'montages', 'famous', 'guest', 'appearances', 'hip-hop', 'drugs', 'THIS', 'serve', 'purpose', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'see', 'snobby', 'rich', 'kids', 'flaunting', 'there', 'stolen', 'jewels', 'cash', 'Facebook', 'photos', 'name', 'art', 'tell', 'story', 'how', 'consumed', 'society', 'lifestyle', 'people', 'are', 'willing', 'go', 'immoral', 'illegal', 'depths', 'just', 'get', 'glimpse', 'what', 'live', 'celebrity', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'agree', 'what', 'did', 'fact', 'point', 'exact', 'opposite', 'Sofia', 'practically', 'making', 'fun', 'whole', 'situation', 'bottom', 'line', 'ridiculous', 'truth', 'kids', 'behavior', 'knew', 'girls', 'growing', 'up', 'as', 'sickening', 'great', 'know', 'been', 'movie', 'made', 'just', 'make', 'look', 'air-headed', 'girls', 'really', 'are']",N/A

1660953,A3JXBZ8F65100O,B00DS7F6RY,Ferdy,"[9, 14]","What makes this movie so fascinating is that it's true.  Five spoiled LA kids actually committed burglaries on the homes of rich and famous celebrities stealing designer clothing, jewelry, cash and drugs.  These weren't kids who were from poor families or who were stealing to fund a drug habit.  They were all from upper middle class households and the burglaries were more of a way to connect with the celebrities who were their idols.  With the money and items they stole, they were given access to a whole lifestyle, one that they envied and practically worshipped through the constant feed of social media and celebrity websites.  The group became celebrities themselves in their own social circles because they bragged about their accomplishments and showed off pictures of each other inside the star's private homes.  Eventually, someone turns the kids in and they are all arrested.  None, however, show real remorse for their actions.  A few of the girls ended up getting a reality television show for a while solely as a result of their popularity and being part of the burglar bunch.  This movie completely brings home the ridiculous nature of our country's obsession with celebrities and how that obsession affects young people.  The film has its funny moments as well as moments that are really sad.  The acting is all spot on.  Emma Watson is dead on as one of the ring leaders and Leslie Mann as the cluelessly pathetic mother of three of the girls involved is hilarious but still sympathetic.  Even the group members who ended up spending some minimal time in jail seem to have brushed it all off and continued their lives without ever realizing what has actually happened.  The feeling of entitlement that they all have is still driving them and they fully capitalize on their notoriety without ever stopping to realize that they've been convicted of a crime, a bad thing. Are we becoming a world obsessed with fame and celebrity?  The Bling Ring makes a strong case that we are, and with websites like TMZ and radar online providing that constant drip of photos and info into our veins, it's actually pretty easy to agree.  Watch the Bling Ring.

Most of the movie is a voyeuristic retelling of the activities of a notorious group as they help themselves to the closets of the rich and famous. There is almost an hour of slowly escalating selfishness and self destructive behavior. The movie assumes the viewer has seen the news, so it does not spoil the film to reveal that two thirds of the way through their fun is cut short as their indulgences catch up with them. The characters are so misguided and self centered that even when caught only the male of the group shows any remorse at all. Even his remorse seemed to be about getting caught not the shameful nature of his conduct. I was actually relieved when they were discovered since the movie had began to drag as their crimes became repetitive. Once they are caught the film only has left to reveal that the parents seem as clueless and disconnected from any ability to empathize with the victims as their imprudent teenaged children. If the performances of the cast were not as outstanding as they are this movie would have been downright painful at its slow pace with such unappealing characters.

1660984,A164NYULBR2DNL,B00DS7F6RY,John R. Peck,"[0, 0]","""The Bling Ring"" tells the story of a group of teenagers who break into the homes of celebrities and steal clothing, jewelry, and money.  It is based on actual events.  It is a disaster. Its only redeeming feature is that it only lasts 90 minutes.  The female characters are interchangeable, including Emma Watson, whose appearance is garnering the most publicity. Her only memorable scene comes at the end of the film, where Nicki (Watson) is being interviewed for television.  Nicki admits is was hard being on the same cellblock as Lindsay Lohan, one of the victims.  No feeling of guilt, no remorse, and a touch of self pity.Some flattering comments on ""The Bling Ring"" from reviewing outlets must be in jest.  ""Witty and Arresting"" Entertainment Weekly.  This is wit?  No dialogue, no character development, repetitious, and boring. By the second heist, you can't wait for the police to show up.  ""Arresting""?  I'll say.  ""Teenage fun""?  Let me count the ways: first degree burglary, grand theft auto, illegal possession and use of a controlled substance, interstate transportation of stolen property, and sale of stolen property.  These juveniles are lucky they operated in California.  In most states, their sentences would have increased by a  factor of 10.  ""Brilliant.  Highly Addictive.""  Salon.com.  It's addictive all right. Marc (Israel Broussard) can't walk two steps with inhaling something.  Rebecca (Katie Chang) has to get high to drive a car.

1660985,ADCC3WHSZNW1R,B00DS7F6RY,J. Richardson,"[0, 0]","Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.Every moviegoer undoubtedly has their own set of performers they would see in anything. The movie itself can be panned by critics and audiences alike, but that won&#8217;t stop them from watching it anyway. Although I don&#8217;t have many, Emma Watson definitely makes my list, and as a result I had to sit through 90 minutes of The Bling Ring. I knew going in that this probably wasn&#8217;t going to resonate with me in any way, shape, or form, but Ms. Watson was in it, and that was really all the motivation I needed to sit down and watch it. As a film, The Bling Ring attempts to portray a message of idolization, but the content is so shallow that it&#8217;s hard to take it too seriously.Based on real events, The Bling Ring attempts to tell the story of the infamous(?) Bling Ring, a group of young adults who went around robbing the homes of celebrities. What starts as a somewhat innocent escapade quickly turns into an obsession as the audience gets to watch these teenagers rob house, after house, after house. Although the movie centers on this ensemble cast, most of the focus seems to be put on Marc Hall (Israel Broussard), a quiet teen who suffers from social anxiety&#8212;he&#8217;s also the only character I actually liked, to some extent. Unfortunately, things spiral out of control when the ringleader Rebecca Ahn (Katie Chang) finds herself addicted to the rush, and the cold hand of karma slaps the group in the face.What bothered me most about this film is that there seemed to be a strong lack of direction and genuine motivation. From start to finish, The Bling Ring is a chaotic blur of drugs, alcohol, partying, and robbing, which left me feeling empty and disengaged. To make matters worse, while it manages to tell its story well enough, the narrative that&#8217;s weaved through these 90 minutes isn&#8217;t terribly interesting. Once I was 15 minutes into the movie I found that I didn&#8217;t care about these characters or their story, after 45 minutes I still didn&#8217;t care, and by the end of it my indifference hadn&#8217;t changed. Once the credits began to roll I began to feel physically ill as I remembered that this is based off something that happened, and that these were real people. It&#8217;s disgusting.In addition, there is little-to-no character development to be found here, as these self-entitled brats clearly don&#8217;t care about anyone, or anything, but themselves. As I said before, the only person I genuinely cared about was Marc, and that&#8217;s only because he was only doing this out of some misguided obligation. He&#8217;s insecure about himself and his abilities, which is why he finds himself so obligated to go along with Rebecca because he finally has someone who gives him some attention&#8212;he&#8217;s also the only one who shows any kind of humane qualities while robbing these people. You could always tell that he really didn&#8217;t want to be part of their shenanigans, and he genuinely seemed bothered by their actions.Where this film truly shines, though, is in its cast. While The Bling Ring may not have the most interesting story, the cast portraying these individuals did a phenomenal job of exemplifying the worst of our youth. Chang and Broussard both gave convincing performances, and Chang showed a lot of potential as an actress. In addition, Watson performed wonderfully as Nicki Moore. Although I don&#8217;t totally agree with the high praise she&#8217;s been given for this role, there&#8217;s no denying that she played the stuck-up, spoiled character really well. Another standout was Claire Julien, who plays Chloe Tainer. This is another up-and-comer who showed a lot of promise with her performance, and hopefully she starts getting offered more roles in the future.Finally, although I personally hated every piece of music used in the film, The Bling Ring's soundtrack does an exceptional job of portraying the fun, care-free attitude of these teens. It's loud, obnoxious, and upbeat, which sets the perfect tone for the scenes and situations present in the movie. Consisting of music from Rick Ross, Kanye West, M.I.A., and Azealia Banks, this soundtrack is only going to appeal to a select group of individuals. However, ignoring its contribution to the film would be a disservice to those who worked on putting it together. The music doesn't have to be mind-blowing to be considered a good soundtrack, it just has to fit within the context of the story, and The Bling Ring more than accomplishes this task.Overall Score: 5/10 - Although The Bling Ring attempts to showcase a message about society&#8217;s obsession with celebrities, it never fully executes the task. Instead, it settles on a mediocre story about a group of very unlikable teens, and the film suffers greatly because of it. All it really accomplished was bringing more attention to this group when their 15 minutes of fame should have been over long ago. In the end, the only redeemable quality would be the performances from the cast, but other than that I can&#8217;t say this is something I would watch again. However, if you&#8217;re curious about it I would suggest a rental, but you shouldn&#8217;t go out of your way to see it.",3,5/10 - Mediocre,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",2013,5257,"['Note', 'May',

1660988,AQCD1307TM93R,B00DS7F6RY,katarinaism,"[0, 0]","Coppola's made an interesting sort of film, whether intentionally or not --there's really no protagonist here, no one to really root for.  Of course the kids in the Bling Ring were the real wrongdoers, burglarizing celebs and indulging in substance abuse, but in a weird ironic way, they were imitating the same reckless vices that some (not all) of the celeb victims were indulging in themselves.  Take Lohan for example, with all the legal struggles and substance abuse issues.  Strangely enough, one of the Bling Ring burglars ends up as Lohan's cellmate, in an interesting twist of fate.There is some rudimentary attempt at making Marc (the only male in the Bling Ring) the storyteller/protagonist, but it fails miserably...is he an outcast just trying to fit in? Perhaps, at first.  But, like Lohan's character in the film 'Mean Girls', what starts as an attempt to fit in becomes something else entirely, as he wholly assimilates into the Bling Ring, including appropriating their value system, or lack thereof.The one thing about this film that was impressive was Emma Watson's take on the Valley Girl accent, which, if I hadn't known she was British, I'd never have guessed.  She really brilliantly copies her real life counterpart's mannerisms and cavalier attitude towards the crimes, including her vapid, blank-eyed gaze.The film doesn't glamorize the crimes, at least in the end, and it shouldn't...Coppola wisely changed the names of the criminals in the film, as if to detract from their personas and focus on their actions.  Ultimately though, this film is more of a cautionary tale than anything entertaining, a &#34;don't let your kids end up like this&#34; sort of movie. Some of the most telling scenes are the few that show the interactions between the parents and their burglarizing children, one of an aloof obliviousness.Why the two stars, after this long review? I guess I'm torn on giving it anything more.

1660993,A356RFKNIG043B,B00DS7F6RY,K. Swanson,"[6, 10]","Easily one of the most painfully meta-ironic and just plain painful movies of this or any other year, Bling Ring sets out to expose celebrity worship but ends up exposing its ""auteur"" more than she realizes.Coppola lays it bare in one of the extras on this blu-ray, where she says that when her friend and ""great admirer"" Paris Hilton let her shoot in her Beverly Hills house (the one robbed eight times before Ms H noticed), Sofia went into Paris' massive shoe room filled with hundreds of pairs of thousand dollar shoes and boots, and, in Coppola's own words, ""I was in my element.""Indeed.That's the hidden, or not, truth in this film: Sofia Coppola and the film itself are in their own way just as shallow, style-fixated and surface-obsessed as the selfish real life scumbags this films purports to expose. Throughout most of this film Coppola basically celebrates these idiots and makes their thefts and obsession with fame and bling and other useless artifacts of our consumer culture seem quite fun. Fun! One might say, oh, she's just portraying reality. But she isn't.Watch the boobtube videos of these dimwits in real life. They are NOT nearly as pleasant as this film makes them out to be. They are mean-spirited, greedy little narcissists who will do almost anything to look ""cool"", if wearing fugly overpriced trash is cool. (Must be, with so many people doing it.) Coppola cast these characters as much nicer people than they really are....but why? Are we supposed to like them for some reason? Apparently. The two thugs in real life are straight up gangster types, but here they're nice guys, one even played by cute little rockstar Gavin Rossdale! Seriously?! The girls are far sweeter here than in real life and played as whitebread as possible. Again: why? The girl who is Asian in real life is pure whitebread here, and the Latino girl likewise. The guy who in real life bounces and flounces around in self-made videos like an absurd caricature of desperately flaming self-absorption is seen in this ""accurate"" film as practically straight as an arrow, except a few brief scenes where he wears pumps. Why? Any guy who delights in stealing woman's clothes and wearing high heels is not likely to be anywhere near the way he's played here. It's all just weird choices on Coppola's part, as if she doesn't want to offend anyone by showing these people as they really are---scheming, petty, nasty---instead making them somewhat sympathetic (if vaguely). But the world has already seen them for what they are for years on tv.Is this film supposed to be accurate....or is it designed to make all this seem kind of like a good idea, until they got caught? The actor who plays the suddenly unflouncy rat Mark here says in one of the BD extras that he thinks the crimes were ""actually kind of cool, when you think about it"". Seriously? Apparently so. Yet that sums up where this film's heart is really at, as does the ten minute Paris Hilton extra.That clip says it all, in fact. Hilton, the ulimate millenial bling proto-whore, is lovingly celebrated, with Coppola gushing irony-free about how cool Paris was to let them use her house for shooting. Hilton's home is nothing but pictures of herself, the very essence of what this film purports to expose...yet this short shows Paris proud of it all, and Coppola ""in her element"" in the midst of Hilton's insanely egotistical all-bling existence. The many pillows with her face on them were a ""joke gift"" from a friend, but she keeps them all over the place, because she ""loves them!"" No doubt at all on that front.I think Bling Ring will dissuade few teens who see it in the future from worshiping celebrity, but rather make these crimes and the empty hard drug taking and other assorted felonies seem like a pretty damn good time. Because it ends with none of these aholes doing more than two years, and most getting off with almost no time at all.So where's the punishment? Where's the dissuasion? Where's the honest portrayal of these thieving little pimps?There isn't any, just Coppola's competent filmic technique (though terrible soundtrack choices) making this shallow life look fun where she claims it should look bad. Perhaps Sofia needs to turn the camera around and look at her own love of fame and surface images, and ask herself why Paris Hilton's shoe closet made her feel so at home. Because this film is in its own blingy way the cinematic equivalent of a closet full of ugly, uncomfortable, sickeningly overpriced shoes.",1,Coppola celebrates these shallow morons without even realizing it,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",2013,4495,"['Easily', 'one', 'most', 'painfully', 'meta-ironic', 'just', 'plain', 'painful', 'movies', 'other', 'year', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'out', 'expose', 'celebrity', 'worship', 'up', 'exposing', 'auteur', 'more', 'bare', 'one', 'extras', 'blu-ray', 'where', 'when', 'friend', 'great', 'admirer', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'let', 'shoot', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'house', 'one', 'robbed', 'eight', 'times', 'Ms', 'H', 'noticed', 'Sofia', 'went', 'Paris', 'massive', 'shoe', 'room', 'filled', 'hundreds', 'pairs', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'shoes', 'boots', 'Coppola', 'own', 'words', 'was', 'element', 'Indeed.That', 'hidden', 'not', 'truth', 'film', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'film', 'are', 'own', 'way', 'just', 'shallow', 'style-fixated', 'surface-obsessed', 'selfish', 'real', 'life', 'scumbags', 'films', 'expose', 'most', 'film', 'Coppola', 'basically', 'idiots', 'thefts', 'obsession', 'fame', 'bling', 'other', 'useless', 'artifacts', 'consumer', 'culture', 'seem', 'quite', 'fun', 'Fun', 'One', 'might', 'say', 'oh', 'just', 'portraying', 'reality', ""isn't.Watch"", 'boobtube', 'videos', 'dimwits', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'NOT', 'nearly', 'as', 'pleasant', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'are', 'mean-spirited', 'greedy', 'little', 'narcissists', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'look', 'cool', 'wearing', 'fugly', 'overpriced', 'trash', 'cool', 'Must', 'be', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'doing', 'Coppola', 'cast', 'characters', 'much', 'people', 'really', 'are', '.but', 'why', 'Are', 'supposed', 'like', 'reason', 'Apparently', 'two', 'thugs', 'real', 'life', 'are', 'straight', 'up', 'gangster', 'types', 'here', ""'re"", 'nice', 'guys', 'one', 'even', 'played', 'cute', 'little', 'rockstar', 'Gavin', 'Rossdale', 'Seriously', 'girls', 'are', 'far', 'sweeter', 'here', 'real', 'life', 'played', 'as', 'whitebread', 'possible', 'Again', 'why', 'girl', 'who', 'Asian', 'real', 'life', 'pure', 'whitebread', 'here', 'Latino', 'girl', 'likewise', 'guy', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'bounces', 'flounces', 'around', 'self-made', 'videos', 'absurd', 'caricature', 'desperately', 'flaming', 'self-absorption', 'seen', 'accurate', 'film', 'practically', 'straight', 'arrow', 'few', 'brief', 'scenes', 'where', 'pumps', 'Why', 'guy', 'who', 'stealing', 'woman', 'clothes', 'wearing', 'high', 'heels', 'not', 'likely', 'be', 'anywhere', 'way', 'played', 'here', 'just', 'weird', 'choices', 'Coppola', 'part', ""n't"", 'want', 'offend', 'anyone', 'showing', 'people', 'really', 'are', '-scheming', 'petty', 'nasty', '-instead', 'making', 'somewhat', 'sympathetic', 'vaguely', 'world', 'already', 'seen', 'what', 'are', 'years', 'tv.Is', 'film', 'supposed', 'be', 'accurate', '.or', 'designed', 'make', 'seem', 'kind', 'good', 'idea', 'got', 'caught', 'actor', 'who', 'suddenly', 'unflouncy', 'rat', 'Mark', 'here', 'one', 'BD', 'extras', 'crimes', 'were', 'actually', 'kind', 'cool', 'when', 'think', 'Seriously', 'Apparently', 'so', 'up', 'where', 'film', 'heart', 'really', 'ten', 'minute', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'clip', 'fact', 'Hilton', 'ulimate', 'millenial', 'bling', 'proto-whore', 'lovingly', 'celebrated', 'Coppola', 'gushing', 'irony-free', 'how', 'cool', 'Paris', 'was', 'let', 'use', 'house', 'shooting', 'Hilton', 'home', 'nothing', 'pictures', 'herself', 'very', 'essence', 'what', 'film', 'expose', 'yet', 'short', 'Paris', 'proud', 'Coppola', 'element', 'midst', 'Hilton', 'insanely', 'egotistical', 'all-bling', 'existence', 'many', 'pillows', 'face', 'were', 'joke', 'gift', 'friend', 'place', 'doubt', 'front.I', 'think', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'will', 'dissuade', 'few', 'teens', 'who', 'see', 'future', 'worshiping', 'celebrity', 'rather', 'make', 'crimes', 'empty', 'hard', 'drug', 'taking', 'other', 'assorted', 'felonies', 'seem', 'pretty', 'damn', 'good', 'time', 'none', 'aholes', 'doing', 'more', 'two', 'years', 'most', 'getting', 'off', 'almost', 'time', 'all.So', 'where', 'punishment', 'Where', 'dissuasion', 'Where', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'thieving', 'little', 'pimps', ""n't"", 'just', 'Coppola', 'competent', 'filmic', 'technique', 'terrible', 'soundtrack', 'choices', 'making', 'shallow', 'life', 'look', 'fun', 'where', 'should', 'look', 'bad', 'Perhaps', 'Sofia', 'turn', 'camera', 'look', 'own', 'love', 'fame', 'surface', 'images', 'ask', 'why', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'shoe', 'closet', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'home', 'film', 'own', 'blingy', 'way', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'closet', 'full', 'ugly', 'uncomfortable', 'sickeningly', 'overpriced', 'shoes']",N/A

The subjects in The Bling Ring are similar to those in previous films: whether Marie Antoinette, the characters in Virgin Suicides or the Bling-ers, these are teenagers in the process of making a transition to adulthood.  Instead of using a narrative style, Coppola goes for what most of us experienced in our own teenage years - blinding speed, mental snapshot images of people/events, often vacuous preoccupations and ever-changing interests.For the Bling Ring, this group bought all of the hype and obsession surrounding celebrities and their trappings and tried to up their own personal stock by stealing pieces of property from the people they idealized.  That this actually happened isn't what surprising; that it hasn't happened MORE is surprising.The actors did a fantastic job of portraying rudderless, self-absorbed, completely detached group of young people.

1661018,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00DS7F6RY,Paul Allaer,"[33, 44]","""The Bling Ring"" (2013 release; 90 min.) brings the now-familiar story of how a group of teenagers living in suburban Los Angeles, with too much time on their hands and an insatiable appetite for ""bling"", decide to start robbing houses of celebrities while they are out of town. I am not spoiling the plot when I tell you that the ""group of five"" (4 girls and 1 guy), along with a couple of others, eventually get found out and caught. The first 50-55 min. of the movie deal with the break-ins and the remainder of the movie looks at what happens after their arrests.Several comments: this is the 5th feature movie directed by Sofia Coppola, and as has been the case with her previous films, this movie is highly stylish in the way it looks at and brings the lives of these teenagers. In fact, the movie is eye-candy pretty much from start to finish. Coppola wrote the script based on the 2010 Vanity Fair article that exposed it all in details not seen before. As to the Bling Ring members themselves: it is perhaps somewhat understandable as to why Marc would get involved with this, as he is new to the school and desparately trying to fit in and make friends. But what about the four girls? There seems no rhyme or reason, other than the ""need for greed"", while apparently lacking any and all moral compass. Equally telling is the almost entire absence of parenting. Yes, there are parents, but they are too busy or too clueless. At some point we see Marc's dad asking Marc and Nicki what they are doing (while they are smoking weed in Marc's bedroom), and when Nicki simply says ""sorry we made too much noise"", Marc's dad simply walks away. An equally telling moment is when Nicki gets interviewed by a reporter towards the end, and she gets visibily irritated when her mom (played beautiflully in a small role by Leslie Mann) says a few words (interjects herself, in Nicki's mind), and she hisses ""mom, this interview is about ME!"" Yes indeed, the ""me! me! me! culture is everywhere. The role of Nicki is played by Emma Watson, and she seems only to get better and better in her post-Harry Potter days (last year in the excellent ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and recently also in a minor role in ""This Is the End""). Can't wait to see what she'll do next.Coppola doesn't take a strong ""social stand"" as such in the movie. Instead, she lets the camera do all the talking, easily exposing the hollowness of the bling culture. ""The Bling Ring"" opened with a lot of positive vibes at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and the screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this afternoon was reasonably well attended for a matinee. It might be the case of clever counter-programming, as it appears every week there is another superhero movie or some other mega-production movie opens (how many Iron Man 3, Man of Steel, After Earth, World War Z and other such movies can a person see in one summer?). If you are in the mood for something else, ""The Bling Ring"" may be just the thing for you. Slick and entertaining, yet exposing the moral vacuum that exists in certain environments, this movie flew by in no time.

Directed by Sofia Coppola, this is based on a true story that made the news in 2009 (note: This is not the TV movie by the same name).2. It&#8217;s about a group of disaffected, self-absorbed, privileged kids that rob celebrities&#8217; houses while they are gone.3. This is a stylish, hip black comedy that was better than I expected. As the kids&#8217; capers escalate, so does the visual style of the film.4. Paris Hilton was robbed by them multiple times in real life, and she makes a cameo in the film. Parts of the movie were filmed in her house - which is beyond description.5. Emma Watson gives a great performance as a bitchy, drugged-out brat. She has definitely left Hogwarts behind.6. This movie is basically about rich people robbing richer people, so it&#8217;s really hard to feel sorry for anybody.7. Coppola doesn&#8217;t really take a stand on the morality of what happened. She kind of lets the kids give their own interpretation of what they did.

The Rebecca character was really something else, and the actress who played her did a very good job, as I really disliked the character; total disregard for other people's property, but then all the characters shared that trait. so story was a fail for me, largely because disliked/disapproved of lead characters and the writer didn't do enough to humanize most of them. the best writing was done with the young man character, I sort of got him. most of the young women characters just seemed vacuous, except the Rebecca character; in another story, she'd have the makings of a really scary villain. on the plus side, the actresses/actors were all very good, and I got to learn how police execute a search/arrest warrant.",2,um...(SPOILERS),1382572800,"10 24, 2013",2013,1678,"['film', 'be', 'mostly', '18', '19', 'year', 'olds', 'breaking', 'houses', 'trying', 'stolen', 'clothes', 'not', 'interesting', 'watch', 'getting', 'high', 'partying', 'other', 'people', 'money', 'also', 'uninteresting', 'watch', 'getting', 'busted', 'law', 'characters', 'so', 'unappealing', 'really', 'nothing', 'hold', 'interest', 'unable', 'view', 'entire', 'film', 'not', 'was', 'boring', 'not', 'one', 'character', 'was', 'engaging', 'felt', 'most', 'sympathy', 'unsuspecting', 'parents', 'suddenly', 'called', 'provide', 'lawyers', 'children', 'yet', 'were', 'apparently', 'same', 'parents', 'who', 'failed', 'teach', 'children', 'not', 'steal', 'have', 'idea', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'story', 'told', 'part', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'sequence', 'where', 'young', 'man', 'first', 'went', 'new', 'school', 'filmmaker', 'captured', 'how', 'difficult', 'can', 'be', 'high', 'schooler', 'outsider', 'how', 'made', 'vulnerable', 'opportunistic', 'Rebecca', 'character', 'connection', 'was', 'communicated', 'well', 'Rebecca', 'character', 'was', 'really', 'something', 'else', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'really', 'disliked', 'character', 'total', 'disregard', 'other', 'people', 'property', 'then', 'characters', 'shared', 'trait', 'so', 'story', 'was', 'fail', 'largely', 'disliked/disapproved', 'lead', 'characters', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'humanize', 'most', 'best', 'writing', 'was', 'done', 'young', 'man', 'character', 'sort', 'got', 'most', 'young', 'women', 'characters', 'just', 'seemed', 'vacuous', 'Rebecca', 'character', 'story', ""'d"", 'have', 'makings', 'really', 'scary', 'villain', 'plus', 'side', 'actresses/actors', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'got', 'learn', 'how', 'police', 'execute', 'search/arrest', 'warrant']",N/A

The victims include Paris Hilton (who allows the director to film inside her house, and also briefly appears as herself), Audrina Patridge, Rachel Bilson, Orlando Bloom and Lindsay Lohan.

Now I must grudgingly concede that Ms. Coppola has markedly improved as a director. 'The Bling Ring', based on the true story of a bunch of California high school students, who burglarized homes of rich celebrities, has the look and feel of a well-crafted music video. In fact, Coppola employs a slew of contemporary tunes (mostly rap), that give the film its raw edge.The story is rather straightforward, following the basic facts of the case against the amoral teenagers who commit the 'bling ring' burglaries. The main anti-hero protagonist is Rebecca who befriends Marc; both attend a high school for underachievers and dropouts. When Marc mentions that one of his well-off acquaintances is out of town, Rebecca has no qualms about convincing him to burglarize the acquaintance's house where they make off with a handbag, cash and keys to the victim's Porsche, which is used to go on an extended shopping spree.Marc and Rebecca meet up with her airhead friend, Nikki (well-played by Emma Watson) and her two adopted sisters and bump into celebrities Kirsten Dunst and Paris Hilton at a nightclub. Marc and Rebecca realize that Paris Hilton is out of town while doing some research on the internet and they then concoct a plan to burglarize her home.Paris Hilton gave Coppola permission to use her home for filming the burglary scenes and one comes away amazed at just how many clothes and 'bling', Paris Hilton owns. Hilton's home is burglarized by the Bling Ring on multiple occasions and other celebrities are targeted including Audrina Patridge, Megan Fox and Orlando Bloom. Unfortunately, the burglary scenes become tiresome and after awhile, one realizes that there's not much to this 'mini-documentary' of sorts, at all!Coppola does well in highlighting the utter vacuousness and amorality of the principals. A few plot developments keep us mildly interested including the sale of a box of Rolex watches to a boyfriend of one of the Bling Ring and the pilfering of a gun from one of the homes, which goes off accidentally, while another one of the Bling Ring, stupidly plays with it.Coppola deftly illustrates the gang's undoing, including a montage of their Facebook posts as well as the news coverage (including surveillance footage) that ultimately leads to their final downfall (capture by police and conviction and sentencing).The Bling Ring's principals, Rebecca and Marc, receive the longest prison sentences (4 years) but the others get off rather easy. After Nikki does a short stint in jail with Lindsay Lohan, she claims to have learned a lot from her experience but has a hard time accepting responsibility (her story is basically that she was led astray). Now Nikki has a website devoted to self-promotion, and one wonders if she's really learned anything from her experiences.Coppola has done well with the actors here and has learned to use the camera adroitly. It's just that the material is slight and events just seem to repeat themselves one too many times throughout the film. Coppola's detached eye captures the lunacy and moral failings of these airhead teenagers as well as the crass materialism of the Bling Ring victims. 'The Bling Ring' is a well crafted film but would be better off as a TV movie.",3,Coppola shows improvement as director but tale of amoral teenagers is repetitious and slight as well,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",2013,3439,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***When', 'saw', 'Translation', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'wrote', 'Sofia', 'Coppola', 'off', 'complete', 'neophyte', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'riding', 'coattails', 'famous', 'father', 'Now', 'must', 'grudgingly', 'concede', 'Ms.', 'Coppola', 'markedly', 'improved', 'director', ""'The"", 'Bling', 'Ring', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'bunch', 'California', 'high', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'burglarized', 'homes', 'rich', 'celebrities', 'look', 'feel', 'well-crafted', 'music', 'video', 'fact', 'Coppola', 'slew', 'contemporary', 'tunes', 'mostly', 'rap', 'give', 'film', 'raw', 'edge.The', 'story', 'rather', 'straightforward', 'following', 'basic', 'facts', 'case', 'amoral', 'teenagers', 'who', 'commit', ""'bling"", 'ring', 'burglaries', 'main', 'anti-hero', 'protagonist', 'Rebecca', 'who', 'Marc', 'attend', 'high', 'school', 'underachievers', 'dropouts', 'When', 'Marc', 'mentions', 'one', 'well-off', 'acquaintances', 'town', 'Rebecca', 'qualms', 'convincing', 'burglarize', 'acquaintance', 'house', 'where', 'make', 'off', 'handbag', 'cash', 'keys', 'victim', 'Porsche', 'used', 'go', 'extended', 'shopping', 'spree.Marc', 'Rebecca', 'meet', 'up', 'airhead', 'friend', 'Nikki', 'well-played', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'two', 'adopted', 'sisters', 'bump', 'celebrities', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'nightclub', 'Marc', 'Rebecca', 'realize', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'town', 'doing', 'research', 'internet', 'then', 'concoct', 'plan', 'burglarize', 'home.Paris', 'Hilton', 'gave', 'Coppola', 'permission', 'use', 'home', 'filming', 'burglary', 'scenes', 'one', 'away', 'amazed', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'clothes', ""'bling"", 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Hilton', 'home', 'burglarized', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'other', 'celebrities', 'are', 'targeted', 'including', 'Audrina', 'Patridge', 'Megan', 'Fox', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Unfortunately', 'burglary', 'become', 'tiresome', 'awhile', 'one', 'not', 'much', ""'mini-documentary"", ""'"", 'sorts', 'Coppola', 'well', 'highlighting', 'utter', 'vacuousness', 'amorality', 'principals', 'few', 'plot', 'developments', 'keep', 'mildly', 'interested', 'including', 'sale', 'box', 'Rolex', 'watches', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'pilfering', 'gun', 'one', 'homes', 'accidentally', 'one', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'stupidly', 'it.Coppola', 'deftly', 'gang', 'undoing', 'including', 'montage', 'Facebook', 'as', 'well', 'news', 'coverage', 'including', 'surveillance', 'footage', 'ultimately', 'final', 'downfall', 'capture', 'police', 'conviction', 'sentencing', '.The', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'principals', 'Rebecca', 'Marc', 'receive', 'longest', 'prison', 'sentences', '4', 'years', 'others', 'get', 'rather', 'easy', 'Nikki', 'short', 'stint', 'jail', 'Lindsay', 'Lohan', 'have', 'learned', 'lot', 'experience', 'hard', 'time', 'accepting', 'responsibility', 'story', 'basically', 'was', 'led', 'astray', 'Now', 'Nikki', 'website', 'devoted', 'self-promotion', 'one', 'wonders', 'really', 'learned', 'anything', 'experiences.Coppola', 'done', 'well', 'actors', 'here', 'learned', 'use', 'camera', 'adroitly', 'just', 'material', 'slight', 'events', 'just', 'seem', 'repeat', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'film', 'Coppola', 'detached', 'eye', 'lunacy', 'moral', 'failings', 'airhead', 'teenagers', 'as', 'well', 'crass', 'materialism', 'Bling', 'Ring', 'victims', ""'The"", 'Bling', 'Ring', 'well', 'crafted', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'TV', 'movie']",N/A
