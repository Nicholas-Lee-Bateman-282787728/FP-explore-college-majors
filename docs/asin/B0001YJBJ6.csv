The head sister is very concerned that they will submit to the sins of the flesh and their souls will be taken over by the evil one. Lots of T & A in this one. But I have faith in my religion so I don't think it was right to portray Nuns of having sex with each other. But when they got naked the whole thing changed! Forget the Nuns!

817135,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0001YJBJ6,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[14, 19]","Sacred Flesh (Nigel Wingrove, 2000)I am a big fan of all things Steve Pittis, and Pittis and his Band of Pain did the soundtrack for Sacred Flesh. That is the only excuse I can offer up for watching this particularly boring slice of softcore nunsploitation all the way through. I mean, before I actually started watching it, I had all kinds of reasons, most of them having to do with nuns wearing wimples and, you know, nothing else. And to be sure, there's some of that here, but not nearly enough. You'd think that a seventy-tow minute softcore film wouldn't have room for anything but softcore. Oh, how wrong you would be.Sacred Flesh seems to want to set itself up as a kind of low-rent Decameron, with attempts to weave a couple of different sexually charged plots together. One centers around the Mother Superior (Sally Tremaine in her only screen appearance) of a convent who's seeing blasphemous visions of Mary Magdalene (The Affair of the Necklace's Katrina Bill), who, in these visions, seems to be a crusader against celibacy. (Not that that would be, you know, outr&eacute; for a hooker.) Magdalene tells the Mother Superior a succession of stories that serve as the frame for various softcore scenes. (Who knew nuns shaved?) The other storyline, which is positively innocent in comparison, deals with Richard, the assistant to the abbott who's come to examine the Mother Superior, and his pursuit of Maid Marion, one of the serving girls at the abbey. (I got the feeling there was supposed to be a great deal more to this storyline, and assumed it ended up on the cutting room floor.) That looked like it actually had some promise--there was certainly a more interesting script in those sections--but I guess wimples and flesh won out. And the reason I'm beating on this point so hard is because I can't believe I'm not applauding the inclusion of more wimples and flesh. But there's just nothing in those scenes, save the obvious, to hold the viewer's attention, and the obvious can get boring after a while. But if you're a collector of nunsploitation, this one's a must. * ",2,How can you be bored by nunsploitation?,1228521600,"12 6, 2008",2008,2090,"['Sacred', 'Flesh', 'Nigel', 'Wingrove', '2000', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'things', 'Steve', 'Pittis', 'Pittis', 'Band', 'Pain', 'did', 'soundtrack', 'Sacred', 'Flesh', 'only', 'excuse', 'can', 'offer', 'up', 'watching', 'particularly', 'boring', 'slice', 'softcore', 'nunsploitation', 'way', 'mean', 'actually', 'started', 'watching', 'had', 'kinds', 'reasons', 'most', 'having', 'do', 'nuns', 'wearing', 'wimples', 'know', 'nothing', 'else', 'be', 'sure', 'here', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', ""'d"", 'think', 'seventy-tow', 'minute', 'softcore', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'room', 'anything', 'softcore', 'Oh', 'how', 'wrong', 'would', 'be.Sacred', 'Flesh', 'want', 'set', 'up', 'kind', 'low-rent', 'Decameron', 'attempts', 'weave', 'couple', 'different', 'sexually', 'charged', 'plots', 'together', 'One', 'centers', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'Sally', 'Tremaine', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'convent', 'who', 'seeing', 'blasphemous', 'visions', 'Mary', 'Magdalene', 'Affair', 'Necklace', 'Katrina', 'Bill', 'who', 'visions', 'be', 'crusader', 'celibacy', 'Not', 'would', 'be', 'know', 'outr', 'eacute', 'hooker', 'Magdalene', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'succession', 'stories', 'serve', 'frame', 'various', 'softcore', 'scenes', 'Who', 'knew', 'nuns', 'shaved', 'other', 'storyline', 'positively', 'innocent', 'comparison', 'deals', 'Richard', 'assistant', 'abbott', 'who', 'come', 'examine', 'Mother', 'Superior', 'pursuit', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'one', 'serving', 'girls', 'abbey', 'got', 'feeling', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'storyline', 'assumed', 'ended', 'up', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'looked', 'actually', 'had', 'promise', 'was', 'certainly', 'more', 'interesting', 'script', 'sections', 'guess', 'wimples', 'flesh', 'won', 'out', 'reason', ""'m"", 'beating', 'point', 'so', 'hard', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'not', 'applauding', 'inclusion', 'more', 'wimples', 'flesh', 'just', 'nothing', 'scenes', 'save', 'obvious', 'hold', 'viewer', 'attention', 'obvious', 'can', 'get', 'boring', 'while', ""'re"", 'collector', 'nunsploitation', 'one', 'must', '*']",Sacred Flesh
