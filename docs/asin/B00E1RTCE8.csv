1663802,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00E1RTCE8,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Isolation is a very rich template for a film.  The varying degrees of isolation can bring to the fore very different aspects of the situation and can offer us intelligent character portraits of how one overcomes the depressive nature of isolation.  There are so many shades to a human being, that coming under the spell of this very condemning circumstance can cast a kaleidoscope of possibilities.In other words; in the right hands the possibilities are endless.I had heard a lot of great things about &#8216;The Wall&#8217;.  There has been a lot said about Martina Gedeck&#8217;s performance, some calling it a tour-de-force and really labeling it one of the finest performances put to film this year.  I have only seen her in a handful of things, but she left a lasting impression on me when I saw her in 2006&#8217;s &#8216;The Lives of Others&#8217; and so I was intrigued greatly by the prospect of her completely consuming me once again.  She has such raw talent, and this premise felt so organic and so capable of drawing out the best in a talented actress.Sadly, I found this to be extremely underwhelming, and for the most part I feel as if it was Gedeck&#8217;s fault.  While I am all for subtlety, this performance felt so hopelessly one-note that I was begging for her to break character and smash a plate!The story follows a woman who ventures into the wilderness with an elderly couple for vacation.  The couple goes hiking, leaving this woman alone in the cabin.  When she eventually ventures out with her trusty dog Lynx, she finds that she has become trapped by an indescribable wall.  She can&#8217;t see the wall, but she can feel it, and it continues to tighten its grip on her.  So, she is alone with her dog and a few other animals.  As she learns to fend for herself (hunting, gathering, defending) she narrates her story as she writes it down in the confines of her world.  Her situation is never explained and her countenance never changes.That is a problem.I have no issue with the ambiguity of her situation.  It is dire and supernatural, of course, but the mystery that surrounds it is actually part of the film&#8217;s impact and so I am drawn to that aspect.  I also found the haunting cinematography to be key to the film&#8217;s overall impact.  The film is just lush and gorgeous, but it always feels slightly dangerous thanks to the key use of lighting and natural elements (that fog).  Still, the remarkably one-note delivery from Gedeck never struck me as natural.  She is so downtrodden (even in the outset, before she is alone) that the true nature of her situation is lost.  We never grow in her desperation but always feel held back by her complacency.  Nothing affects her.  She is void of any emotional connection to her surroundings, and when she shows a brief glimpse of some sort of emotion (the whole gun scene in the very end) it is for a mere moment and then gone, without real explanation.  She reminds me a lot of Ryan Gosling&#8217;s monotone performance in &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217;, and I hated that one too.For as rich as the prose was, the overall execution felt so uninspired, or underworked.",3,I hit a wall with this one&#8230;,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,3156,"['Isolation', 'very', 'rich', 'template', 'film', 'varying', 'degrees', 'isolation', 'can', 'bring', 'fore', 'very', 'different', 'aspects', 'situation', 'can', 'offer', 'intelligent', 'character', 'portraits', 'how', 'one', 'depressive', 'nature', 'isolation', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'shades', 'human', 'being', 'coming', 'spell', 'very', 'condemning', 'circumstance', 'can', 'cast', 'kaleidoscope', 'possibilities.In', 'other', 'words', 'right', 'possibilities', 'are', 'endless.I', 'had', 'heard', 'lot', 'great', 'things', '8216', 'Wall', '8217', 'been', 'lot', 'said', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', '8217', 's', 'performance', 'calling', 'tour-de-force', 'really', 'labeling', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', 'put', 'film', 'year', 'have', 'only', 'seen', 'handful', 'things', 'left', 'lasting', 'impression', 'when', 'saw', '2006', '8217', '8216', 'Lives', 'Others', '8217', 'so', 'was', 'intrigued', 'greatly', 'prospect', 'completely', 'consuming', 'once', 'again', 'such', 'raw', 'talent', 'premise', 'felt', 'so', 'organic', 'so', 'capable', 'drawing', 'out', 'best', 'talented', 'actress.Sadly', 'found', 'be', 'extremely', 'underwhelming', 'most', 'part', 'feel', 'was', 'Gedeck', '8217', 'fault', 'am', 'subtlety', 'performance', 'felt', 'so', 'hopelessly', 'one-note', 'was', 'begging', 'break', 'character', 'smash', 'plate', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'ventures', 'wilderness', 'elderly', 'couple', 'vacation', 'couple', 'hiking', 'leaving', 'woman', 'alone', 'cabin', 'When', 'eventually', 'ventures', 'out', 'trusty', 'dog', 'Lynx', 'become', 'trapped', 'indescribable', 'wall', 'can', '8217', 'see', 'wall', 'can', 'feel', 'tighten', 'grip', 'So', 'alone', 'dog', 'few', 'other', 'animals', 'fend', 'hunting', 'gathering', 'defending', 'story', 'down', 'confines', 'world', 'situation', 'never', 'explained', 'countenance', 'never', 'changes.That', 'problem.I', 'have', 'issue', 'ambiguity', 'situation', 'dire', 'supernatural', 'course', 'mystery', 'actually', 'part', 'film', '8217', 's', 'impact', 'so', 'am', 'drawn', 'aspect', 'also', 'found', 'haunting', 'cinematography', 'be', 'key', 'film', '8217', 'overall', 'impact', 'film', 'just', 'lush', 'gorgeous', 'always', 'slightly', 'dangerous', 'thanks', 'key', 'use', 'lighting', 'natural', 'elements', 'fog', 'Still', 'remarkably', 'one-note', 'delivery', 'Gedeck', 'never', 'struck', 'natural', 'so', 'downtrodden', 'even', 'outset', 'alone', 'true', 'nature', 'situation', 'lost', 'never', 'grow', 'desperation', 'always', 'feel', 'held', 'back', 'complacency', 'Nothing', 'void', 'emotional', 'connection', 'surroundings', 'when', 'brief', 'glimpse', 'sort', 'emotion', 'whole', 'gun', 'scene', 'very', 'end', 'mere', 'moment', 'then', 'gone', 'real', 'explanation', 'lot', 'Ryan', 'Gosling', '8217', 'monotone', 'performance', '8216', 'Only', 'God', 'Forgives', '8217', 'hated', 'one', 'too.For', 'as', 'rich', 'prose', 'was', 'overall', 'execution', 'felt', 'so', 'uninspired', 'underworked']",N/A

1663807,A1K2ZXT12U5RQK,B00E1RTCE8,Cameron Pietrafeso,"[8, 14]","With an interesting premise, and beautiful scenery, I was sucked in.  A tail of self discovery for a woman isolated in the wilderness, a mysterious invisible wall (The Dome anyone?), I figured &#34;why not?&#34;  I knew that a narrated style movie such as this would be a little art-housey but this one was too far.  I'd warn that there are spoilers ahead in this review, but seeing as the film is pre-spoiled I shall not bother.To sum things up so you don't have to waste your time, the entire movie is narrated by this woman who is writing down her experiences of the last few years of being trapped by a large invisible barrier inside an Austrian country side.  She can see a few neighbors mysteriously frozen in place, though other elements of the environment, such as flowing water, seem to continue outside of her bubble.  She fends for herself taking care of livestock and farming inside her prison and writing very flowery and often poetic phrases about her lonely existence and how calm she is beginning to feel.  This goes on for a few years, a time much shorter than watching the movie felt, until a mysterious man miraculously shows up one summer day to hack her young bull to death and kill her dog, the only friend she has.  Then she runs out of paper and concludes her tail.  The End.The actress, without having many lines, was quite good I thought.  Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  The scenery was also spectacular, and that's all I can say positively about it.  My first real complaint is that it seems she is going on a personal journey with her isolation and introspection.  Unfortunately, we the audience, cannot go on it with her has we have no idea who she was before.  Was she like Tom Hank's Cast Away character and too busy and hectic to realize the life he was leading?  Was she a narcissist?  A bad person?  Hated animals?  Getting over a lost love?  We just don't know.  All we know is that she came up to a secluded hunting loge with a couple, even though she hated hunting, and didn't want to go into town with them right after they arrived.  We know nothing about her, her relationships, her reasons, or her purpose.  This made a lot of the dramatic introspection she was narrating pointless.  I guess we also know that she somehow had enough basic farming knowledge to survive even though she clearly stated she was weak and unaccustomed to that type of work.I also found her lack of curiosity about the wall disturbing.  I take that she couldn't go too far away from the cow, as it needed tending, but after the initial shock wore off she didn't seem to want to do things like dig under the wall, find out how big it was, or find out if others existed in it (fires, smoke signals, etc...).  She just accepted it and her situation and  moved on with her potato harvesting.To end the way it did felt like a cheap emotional ploy.  Let's kill off her best friend, the dog, out of the blue by having a mysterious man show up.  Who was this man?  Where did he come from?  Why was he there?  Was he just insane or did he have a purpose?  Unless he was totally off his rocker wouldn't his first impression upon coming across the logging and domesticated animals of someone else after 3 years be more &#34;yea I'm not alone!!!&#34; rather than &#34;let me axe this cow and dog to death&#34;?  If he was insane then how did he last so long though the harsh winters?  Wouldn't her reaction likewise be more to find out where he came from, where the wall ends, if others are there, etc... than just to shut herself off in her little house?Finally, the abrupt ending  without any questions being answered left a bad taste in the mouth.  Don't tell me about how you get to make up your own conclusions, as that's just lazy storytelling.  We find out nothing about the wall, what her future is like, if the world survives, nothing.  I finished the movie asking what was the point and why did I ever waste my time on this?",1,Why?,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",2013,3937,"['interesting', 'premise', 'beautiful', 'scenery', 'was', 'sucked', 'tail', 'self', 'discovery', 'woman', 'isolated', 'wilderness', 'mysterious', 'invisible', 'wall', 'Dome', 'anyone', 'figured', '34', 'why', 'not', '34', 'knew', 'narrated', 'style', 'movie', 'such', 'would', 'be', 'little', 'art-housey', 'one', 'was', 'too', 'far', ""'d"", 'warn', 'are', 'spoilers', 'ahead', 'review', 'seeing', 'film', 'pre-spoiled', 'shall', 'not', 'bother.To', 'sum', 'things', 'up', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'waste', 'time', 'entire', 'movie', 'narrated', 'woman', 'who', 'writing', 'down', 'experiences', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'being', 'trapped', 'large', 'invisible', 'barrier', 'Austrian', 'country', 'side', 'can', 'see', 'few', 'neighbors', 'mysteriously', 'frozen', 'place', 'other', 'elements', 'environment', 'such', 'flowing', 'water', 'seem', 'continue', 'bubble', 'herself', 'taking', 'care', 'livestock', 'farming', 'prison', 'writing', 'very', 'flowery', 'often', 'poetic', 'phrases', 'lonely', 'existence', 'how', 'calm', 'beginning', 'feel', 'few', 'years', 'time', 'much', 'shorter', 'watching', 'movie', 'felt', 'mysterious', 'man', 'miraculously', 'up', 'one', 'summer', 'day', 'hack', 'young', 'bull', 'death', 'kill', 'dog', 'only', 'friend', 'Then', 'paper', 'tail', 'End.The', 'actress', 'having', 'many', 'lines', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'thought', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Cast', 'Away', 'scenery', 'was', 'also', 'spectacular', 'can', 'say', 'positively', 'My', 'first', 'real', 'complaint', 'going', 'personal', 'journey', 'isolation', 'introspection', 'Unfortunately', 'audience', 'can', 'not', 'go', 'have', 'idea', 'who', 'was', 'before', 'Was', 'Tom', 'Hank', 'Cast', 'Away', 'character', 'too', 'busy', 'hectic', 'realize', 'life', 'was', 'leading', 'Was', 'narcissist', 'bad', 'person', 'Hated', 'animals', 'Getting', 'lost', 'love', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'know', 'came', 'up', 'secluded', 'hunting', 'loge', 'couple', 'even', 'hated', 'hunting', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'go', 'town', 'right', 'arrived', 'know', 'nothing', 'relationships', 'reasons', 'purpose', 'made', 'lot', 'dramatic', 'introspection', 'was', 'narrating', 'pointless', 'guess', 'also', 'know', 'somehow', 'had', 'enough', 'basic', 'farming', 'knowledge', 'survive', 'even', 'clearly', 'stated', 'was', 'weak', 'unaccustomed', 'type', 'work.I', 'also', 'found', 'lack', 'curiosity', 'wall', 'disturbing', 'take', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'too', 'far', 'away', 'cow', 'needed', 'tending', 'initial', 'shock', 'wore', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'do', 'things', 'dig', 'wall', 'find', 'out', 'how', 'big', 'was', 'find', 'out', 'others', 'existed', 'fires', 'smoke', 'signals', 'etc', 'just', 'accepted', 'situation', 'moved', 'potato', 'harvesting.To', 'end', 'way', 'did', 'felt', 'cheap', 'emotional', 'ploy', 'Let', 'kill', 'off', 'best', 'friend', 'dog', 'blue', 'having', 'mysterious', 'man', 'show', 'up', 'Who', 'was', 'man', 'Where', 'did', 'come', 'Why', 'was', 'there', 'Was', 'just', 'insane', 'did', 'have', 'purpose', 'was', 'totally', 'rocker', 'would', ""n't"", 'first', 'impression', 'coming', 'logging', 'domesticated', 'animals', 'someone', 'else', '3', 'years', 'be', 'more', '34', 'yea', ""'m"", 'not', 'alone', '34', 'rather', '34', 'let', 'axe', 'cow', 'dog', 'death', '34', 'was', 'insane', 'then', 'how', 'did', 'last', 'so', 'long', 'harsh', 'winters', 'Would', ""n't"", 'her', 'reaction', 'likewise', 'be', 'more', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'came', 'where', 'wall', 'others', 'are', 'there', 'etc', 'just', 'shut', 'off', 'little', 'house', 'Finally', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'questions', 'being', 'answered', 'left', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'Do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'how', 'get', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'conclusions', 'just', 'lazy', 'storytelling', 'find', 'out', 'nothing', 'wall', 'what', 'future', 'world', 'nothing', 'finished', 'movie', 'asking', 'was', 'point', 'why', 'did', 'ever', 'waste', 'time']",N/A

1663810,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B00E1RTCE8,David R. Eastwood,"[5, 6]","THE WALL (Austrian, 2012; based on Marlen Haushofer's 1963 novel published in German as DIE WAND)  is a thought-provoking ""premise story"" about the end of the human race.The unnamed central character of THE WALL is a widow in her forties (wonderfully played by Martina Gedeck) who was on vacation with her cousin and his wife at their Alpine cottage and who went to bed rather than joining them for evening drinks in the nearby village. When she awoke the next morning, they had not returned, and when she tried walking to the village with their dog, she discovered that a massive transparent wall separated her from the entire outside world. Gazing through it, she could see that all animal life there, including human life, seems to have mysteriously perished overnight. Only she and the insects, birds, foxes, deer, and other animal life on her side of the wall are still alive.Until the final few minutes, where a new element is introduced, audio portion of this film consists chiefly of the widow's voice-over, conveying her vividly detailed accounts of her struggles to survive on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis, her speculations about what happened to the outside world, her memories and occasional mourning about her earlier life, her illnesses and injuries, her loving relationships with the dog, several cats, a cow, and a young bull, her increasing appreciation for the natural world around her, her reflections on the nature of human life and the nature of the human race, and her gradual transformation into a person who can accept her new role as apparently the last person on earth.As viewers and listeners, we admire her great courage, her coping skills, her intellect and imagination, and most of all her generous heart and loving nature as she interacts with her household animals and the animals outdoors. Also as viewers and listeners, we speculate about and attempt to solve the mysteries WITHIN the film (what has caused the deaths outside the wall? who or what is responsible? how did the wall come into existence?) and the mystery OF the film itself (what is the chief purpose of its director, Julian Roman P&ouml;lsler, for telling this tale?).Suspense is created by dozens of spoken flash-forwards that inform us about the deaths of several of her beloved animals, and we wonder when and exactly how these will occur. Especially in the book, a few of these flash-forwards provided us with one or two specific details that led us to suspect that another human being MAY still be alive ... somewhere inside the protective wall. And if this is so, we wondered, HOW will the woman react?I shall not give any ""spoiler"" answers here. Instead, let me just say that my hypothesis is that THE WALL seems to be a ""cautionary parable"" like Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHT-FOUR and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451 and scores of other serious science fiction/speculative fiction works. It seems designed to warn us, like a lighthouse, to change course before it is too late.As such, if I were giving it a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a solid ""A"".  Incidentally, I gave the novel THE WALL a ""B+"", but the film version has the advantage of being shorter and more tightly organized AND a bit more intense because of its visual and vocal elements: we SEE the Alpine valley and meadow and forest, we SEE the woman, we SEE her animals, we SEE their joys and sorrows, and through it all we HEAR the tone of her marvelous voice. As a slight trade-off, I do think that the sheer length of the book helped make it somewhat clearer what the message of the author was. (Of course people viewing a DVD at home have advantages that people in movie theaters lack: for one, they can re-watch any scenes they wish, as many times as they wish.)If anyone would care to see a more specific statement about the A-to-Z ""plot"" of this novel, I have provided one in the ""COMMENTS"" section below.NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION: The DVD comes with a German audio track and an English audio track.

It is directed by much-admired Julian P&ouml;lsler (many awards and nominations throughout Europe) whose work is primarily seen on German television. Adapted from the classic novel by Marlen Haushofer, this is a masterful performance done almost in solitude by a wonderful actress.A woman is going to visit some friends who drop her off at their cabin, then go back into town to buy some more supplies. Their dog Lynx stays with her, even though there is no love lost between her and the dog.We are enthralled by:* Martina Gedeck (""Mostly Martha"" and ""The Lives of Others"") is the poor gal who, after taking the dog for a walk in the woods, finds herself trapped by an invisible wall and neither she nor the dog can get out. Her friends are nowhere to be seen and she is now absolutely alone except for Lynx.This tour de force shows us what Ms. Gedeck can do with NO makeup, NO love story, NO telephones, NO car crashes and NO Computer Generated Imaging. (There ARE three gunshots.) Her solitude is almost palpable, she never speaks, the only narrative comes as a voiceover when she is writing in her journal on scraps of paper she has found in her friends' cabin. She first writes with a pen, then with pencil, and finally is down to a stub. I couldn't help but worry about her supply of bullets, kerosene and matches. Eventually, her main concern becomes how to keep her humanity.Filmed in the area around Salzkammergut, Austria, the scenery is breathtaking, the weather is chilly, and her spectacular surroundings emphasize her isolation. A cat shows up, along with a cow, so this foursome becomes almost inseparable. Her survival instincts demand that she learn how to plant potatoes, gut a deer, milk a cow, help deliver a calf, cut hay for the winter, and shoot a gun. You should see the look on the dog's face the first time she shoots the gun and misses the deer!BTW, both of those movies in brackets are HIGHLY recommended.

1663818,A3MTULATO06OS5,B00E1RTCE8,"Lady Fancifull ""Tinkerbell""","[2, 4]","I came to this 2013 filmed version on the back of reading Marlen Haushofer's 1968 published book. Indeed, the republication of the book, and its reaching a new and wider audience, has come precisely because of this film. We appear to have a virtuous circle going on, for once, in the relationship between the single writer's vision and the collaborative vision of the film.Normally wary of film adaptations of books which have strongly resonated,  I might have passed Die Wand by, except for the fact that thoughtful reviews re-iterated the powerful sense evoked by the book, speaking of the patience, depth and meditative quietude and despair in the film. I'm so glad I trusted the sensibilities of the reviewers, because with this film, is something which deepens my earlier reading of the book - and the book itself is deepened by the dynamics of vision, sound and embodiment of the narrator in Martina Gedeck's deep performance The film, directed by Julian Roman Polsler runs for 108 minutes, and can be watched with German or English narration, and is also subtitled. I chose to have Gedeck's voiceover, and English subtitles. A performance of this truth needs no other interpreter getting between actor and viewer, in my opinion.The word which the film owns is `reverence' - not a sterile reverence for Haushofer's strange and disturbing book about the only woman left alive, in a lonely landscape, after some cataclysmic event has turned all life outside her Alpine valley to stone - but a reverence for the living world itself, for authenticity, and for, in Haushofer's words, love as the rational choice. Not the gushy gushy of sentimentality, but a respect for the nature of matter, of the living and the dying of things, of the tangled, interconnecting web which human being alone have choices about - often taking the wrong paths of enmity and hatred.Certainly this is not a film to satisfy if what is wanted is a `what happens next' as, like the book, itself, a journal written by the narrator over four months as she looks back over her two years since `the end', as she waits, implacably, for her own, time is looked forward to and back. There is no fast cutting, there is the slow pace of the breathing landscape, the camera and the actor observing the stillness. In this, it reminds me of the film [[ASIN:B0024RV3E4 Into Great Silence], an unspoken filmic observance of life in a Carthusian Monastery.The transformation of the city dwelling narrator, as Gedeck inhabits her (it is a performance of inhabitation and revelation rather than of demonstration) in her designer cream frock, full faced and jittery, to the shorn haired figure, like one of the Fates, staring into the inevitability of whatever new or old may befall, is haunting.The spacious empty soundtrack, except for Gedeck's voiceover of occasional phrases from her journal, and the natural sounds, is perfectly deepened by the underlining, sparing use of a Bach partita, melancholy and haunting, perfectly balanced in its plenitude and its emptiness.Forgive the purpling prose, this/these, (film and book, book and film) are fully what they are, to be experienced by their next reader/viewer, who will enter into their own relationship with both film and book",5,As powerful and plangent as the book : deepening mirrors,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,3241,"['came', '2013', 'filmed', 'version', 'back', 'reading', 'Marlen', 'Haushofer', '1968', 'published', 'book', 'Indeed', 'republication', 'book', 'reaching', 'new', 'wider', 'audience', 'come', 'precisely', 'film', 'appear', 'have', 'virtuous', 'circle', 'going', 'once', 'relationship', 'single', 'writer', 'vision', 'collaborative', 'vision', 'film.Normally', 'wary', 'film', 'adaptations', 'books', 'have', 'strongly', 'resonated', 'might', 'have', 'passed', 'Die', 'Wand', 'fact', 'thoughtful', 'reviews', 're-iterated', 'powerful', 'sense', 'evoked', 'book', 'speaking', 'patience', 'depth', 'meditative', 'quietude', 'despair', 'film', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'trusted', 'sensibilities', 'reviewers', 'film', 'something', 'earlier', 'reading', 'book', 'book', 'deepened', 'dynamics', 'vision', 'sound', 'embodiment', 'narrator', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'deep', 'performance', 'film', 'directed', 'Julian', 'Roman', 'Polsler', '108', 'minutes', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'German', 'English', 'narration', 'also', 'subtitled', 'chose', 'have', 'Gedeck', 'voiceover', 'English', 'subtitles', 'performance', 'truth', 'other', 'interpreter', 'getting', 'actor', 'viewer', 'opinion.The', 'word', 'film', 'reverence', 'not', 'sterile', 'reverence', 'Haushofer', 'strange', 'disturbing', 'book', 'only', 'woman', 'left', 'alive', 'lonely', 'landscape', 'cataclysmic', 'event', 'turned', 'life', 'Alpine', 'valley', 'stone', 'reverence', 'living', 'world', 'authenticity', 'Haushofer', 'words', 'love', 'rational', 'choice', 'Not', 'gushy', 'gushy', 'sentimentality', 'respect', 'nature', 'matter', 'living', 'dying', 'things', 'tangled', 'interconnecting', 'web', 'human', 'being', 'alone', 'have', 'choices', 'often', 'taking', 'wrong', 'paths', 'enmity', 'hatred.Certainly', 'not', 'film', 'satisfy', 'what', 'wanted', 'what', 'next', 'book', 'journal', 'written', 'narrator', 'four', 'months', 'back', 'two', 'years', 'end', 'implacably', 'own', 'time', 'looked', 'forward', 'back', 'fast', 'cutting', 'slow', 'pace', 'breathing', 'landscape', 'camera', 'actor', 'observing', 'stillness', 'film', '[', '[', 'ASIN', 'B0024RV3E4', 'Into', 'Great', 'Silence', ']', 'unspoken', 'filmic', 'observance', 'life', 'Carthusian', 'Monastery.The', 'transformation', 'city', 'dwelling', 'narrator', 'Gedeck', 'performance', 'inhabitation', 'revelation', 'rather', 'demonstration', 'designer', 'cream', 'frock', 'full', 'faced', 'jittery', 'shorn', 'haired', 'figure', 'one', 'Fates', 'staring', 'inevitability', 'new', 'old', 'may', 'befall', 'haunting.The', 'spacious', 'empty', 'soundtrack', 'Gedeck', 'voiceover', 'occasional', 'phrases', 'journal', 'natural', 'sounds', 'perfectly', 'deepened', 'underlining', 'sparing', 'use', 'Bach', 'partita', 'melancholy', 'haunting', 'perfectly', 'balanced', 'plenitude', 'emptiness.Forgive', 'purpling', 'prose', 'this/these', 'film', 'book', 'book', 'film', 'are', 'fully', 'what', 'are', 'be', 'experienced', 'next', 'reader/viewer', 'who', 'will', 'enter', 'own', 'relationship', 'film', 'book']",N/A

1663826,A3H9JSM1SUTE4O,B00E1RTCE8,Robin Simmons,"[21, 22]","Directed by Julian P&ouml;lsler, award-winning German actress Martina Gedeck stars in this riveting, allegorical tale of survival set in the spectacular Austrian countryside.  Exquisite cinematography propels this puzzling and thoughtful story of isolation and its impact on the human spirit as it is forced to rejoin the breathtaking but indifferent natural world.Naturally I thought of Stephen King's ""THE DOME"" (both the book and the cheap looking, seemingly endless CBS series with the god-awful music) as the movie began.  But this is a different take on a similar premise with superior satisfaction and rewards for the viewer.Gedeck delivers a tour-de-force performance as she endures all kinds of physical and psychological challenges when she discovers, to her horror, that she is trapped behind an invisible, impenetrable wall in a remote mountain area. This compelling, mind-bending adventure that's seasoned with philosophical, psychological and sci-fi elements kept me involved.Based on Marlen Haushofer's highly-praised 1962 novel (the only novel of her works to be translated into English), THE WALL is the story of Gedeck's unnamed character -- The Woman -- who is vacationing in the stunning Austrian mountains when an invisible wall suddenly and inexplicably encompasses the countryside and cuts her off from the civilization she left behind.  Though the blue sky, chirping birds and surrounding nature appear to be normal, The Woman is in fact cut of from all human contact and separated from the rest of the world.  With her loyal dog Lynx as a sole companion, The Woman becomes immersed and enmeshed in a pristine world hardly touched by civilization and ruled only by the laws of nature, which prove to be both benign and dangerous.  As she grapples with her bizarre circumstances, The Woman begins an inward journey of spiritual discovery and eventually transcendence.  At one point we hear her voice over narration (taken from her journal): ""I pity animals and I pity people, because they are thrown into this life without being consulted,"" she says. ""Maybe people are more deserving of pity, because they have just enough intelligence to resist the natural course of things.""",4,WALLS -- REAL AND IMAGINED?,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",2013,2199,"['Directed', 'Julian', 'P', 'ouml', 'lsler', 'award-winning', 'German', 'actress', 'Martina', 'Gedeck', 'riveting', 'allegorical', 'tale', 'survival', 'set', 'spectacular', 'Austrian', 'countryside', 'Exquisite', 'cinematography', 'propels', 'puzzling', 'thoughtful', 'story', 'isolation', 'impact', 'human', 'spirit', 'forced', 'rejoin', 'breathtaking', 'indifferent', 'natural', 'world.Naturally', 'thought', 'Stephen', 'King', 'DOME', 'book', 'cheap', 'looking', 'seemingly', 'endless', 'CBS', 'series', 'god-awful', 'music', 'movie', 'began', 'different', 'take', 'similar', 'premise', 'superior', 'satisfaction', 'rewards', 'viewer.Gedeck', 'tour-de-force', 'performance', 'kinds', 'physical', 'psychological', 'challenges', 'when', 'horror', 'trapped', 'invisible', 'impenetrable', 'wall', 'remote', 'mountain', 'area', 'compelling', 'mind-bending', 'adventure', 'seasoned', 'philosophical', 'psychological', 'sci-fi', 'elements', 'kept', 'involved.Based', 'Marlen', 'Haushofer', 'highly-praised', '1962', 'novel', 'only', 'novel', 'works', 'be', 'translated', 'English', 'THE', 'WALL', 'story', 'Gedeck', 'unnamed', 'character', 'Woman', 'who', 'vacationing', 'stunning', 'Austrian', 'mountains', 'when', 'invisible', 'wall', 'suddenly', 'inexplicably', 'countryside', 'off', 'civilization', 'left', 'behind', 'blue', 'sky', 'chirping', 'birds', 'surrounding', 'nature', 'appear', 'be', 'normal', 'Woman', 'fact', 'cut', 'human', 'contact', 'separated', 'rest', 'world', 'loyal', 'dog', 'Lynx', 'sole', 'companion', 'Woman', 'immersed', 'enmeshed', 'pristine', 'world', 'hardly', 'touched', 'civilization', 'ruled', 'only', 'laws', 'nature', 'prove', 'be', 'benign', 'dangerous', 'bizarre', 'circumstances', 'Woman', 'inward', 'journey', 'spiritual', 'discovery', 'eventually', 'transcendence', 'one', 'point', 'hear', 'voice', 'narration', 'taken', 'journal', 'pity', 'animals', 'pity', 'people', 'are', 'thrown', 'life', 'being', 'consulted', 'Maybe', 'people', 'are', 'more', 'deserving', 'pity', 'have', 'just', 'enough', 'intelligence', 'resist', 'natural', 'course', 'things']",N/A

The plot is pretty simple in that three people go to a hunting lodge up in the mountains of Austria. Frau is left when her companions go to the village for provisions; she falls asleep and in the morning realise they have not returned. After a while she sets out to find them only to discover she has been surrounded by an impenetrable yet invisible wall.Once the shock has worn off she has to take stock and all she really has in the loyal dog Lynx. She is telling her story through the words she has written in her journal and as she slowly runs out of paper we are brought closer to the present day. What follows in a haunting, mesmerising and totally enthralling film. Though the dialogue is minimal, as you would expect having no one to talk to, the narrative is just so compelling it carries the story. The acting by Martina Gedeck  (&#8216;The Lives of others&#8217;) is amazing, the animals were pretty impressive too, especially Lynx. There are some scenes of apparent animal cruelty so please be advised as I know that can be upsetting.This though is simply beautiful, a story pared to the bone yet done so leaving only what is essential and it is a visual feast. All sci &#8211; fi has to have an element of the existential and this is all about the basic drive that keeps us going, even when it all seems futile.
