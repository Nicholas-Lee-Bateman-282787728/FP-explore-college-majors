1407052,A1OFGFIGIMCCW2,B004GNEDAK,Free to be Me,"[0, 1]",This movie was so bad that I had to turn it off.  I really enjoy foreign films but this one not only bored me but it got to the point where I was frustrated with the movie.  Maybe I should have given it longer than the 20-30 minutes I put into it but I didn't enjoy that time whatsoever.  I even attempted to fast forward the movie to see if it got any better...and it didn't in my eyes.,1,So bad I turned it off,1371168000,"06 14, 2013",2013,387,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'had', 'turn', 'off', 'really', 'enjoy', 'foreign', 'films', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'bored', 'got', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'frustrated', 'movie', 'Maybe', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'longer', '20-30', 'minutes', 'put', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'time', 'whatsoever', 'even', 'attempted', 'fast', 'forward', 'movie', 'see', 'got', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'eyes']",Preludium

1407055,A26EANSVYTPGCD,B004GNEDAK,Mark Anderson,"[1, 1]","This movie was all shot with continuous filming, so the camera doesn't ever stop. It follows some very unstable folks around and chronicles their human frailties and how they deal with them and each other. I was most amazed by the fact they were able to film it the way they did, it had to be difficult and demanding for everyone involved. It was worth watching just to see how they pulled that off. But otherwise, just a so-so storyline and characters.",4,Ambitious...and stressfull,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,453,"['movie', 'was', 'shot', 'continuous', 'filming', 'camera', ""n't"", 'ever', 'stop', 'very', 'unstable', 'folks', 'chronicles', 'human', 'frailties', 'how', 'deal', 'other', 'was', 'most', 'amazed', 'fact', 'were', 'able', 'film', 'way', 'did', 'had', 'be', 'difficult', 'demanding', 'everyone', 'involved', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'how', 'pulled', 'off', 'otherwise', 'just', 'so-so', 'storyline', 'characters']",Preludium
