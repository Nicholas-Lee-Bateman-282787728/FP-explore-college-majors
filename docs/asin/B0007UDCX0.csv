890771,AMWPDGUXHTLYE,B0007UDCX0,Aunt Book,"[16, 23]","Having read that Universal once again mucked up the music, I won't be buying Season 3 of Quantum Leap.  There are some shows in which the music doesn't really matter - Laverne & Shirley's first season, for example, mentions on the box that the music is different, but the songs in Laverne & Shirley are merely incidental, background sounds.  In QL, the music was a major part of the show, helping to set the time period, helping to set the mood.I have read some of the reviews from people who claim that the change in music makes no difference (generally such comments are written in a boorish, bumptious, hectoring tone, a fact which I find rather interesting and quite telling).  No?  Close your eyes and imagine the Lord of the Rings movies with elevator music instead of the soaring splendor of its real score.  Ponder ""American Graffiti"" with the sort of synthesized slop that has replaced the original music in QL.  Then try to tell me that music doesn't matter.The choice is not these travesties or nothing for most QL fans; it's a choice of a poorer-quality taped-from-TV video with the real music, taking up more shelf space than a DVD set; or a better-quality picture with no commercials that has had much of the atmosphere stripped from it.  I'll take my tapes, thank you very much.  If Universal comes to its senses and releases QL in unmangled form, even if it costs more, I'll buy it.  Until then, count me out.",1,"Hey, Universal, call me when you come to your senses.",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,1425,"['Having', 'read', 'Universal', 'once', 'again', 'mucked', 'up', 'music', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'buying', 'Season', '3', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'are', 'shows', 'music', ""n't"", 'really', 'matter', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'first', 'season', 'example', 'mentions', 'box', 'music', 'different', 'songs', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'are', 'merely', 'incidental', 'background', 'sounds', 'QL', 'music', 'was', 'major', 'part', 'show', 'helping', 'set', 'time', 'period', 'helping', 'set', 'mood.I', 'have', 'read', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'change', 'music', 'difference', 'generally', 'such', 'comments', 'are', 'written', 'boorish', 'bumptious', 'hectoring', 'tone', 'fact', 'find', 'rather', 'interesting', 'quite', 'telling', 'Close', 'eyes', 'imagine', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'movies', 'elevator', 'music', 'instead', 'soaring', 'splendor', 'real', 'score', 'Ponder', 'American', 'Graffiti', 'sort', 'synthesized', 'slop', 'replaced', 'original', 'music', 'QL', 'Then', 'try', 'tell', 'music', ""n't"", 'matter.The', 'choice', 'not', 'travesties', 'nothing', 'most', 'QL', 'fans', 'choice', 'poorer-quality', 'taped-from-TV', 'video', 'real', 'music', 'taking', 'up', 'more', 'shelf', 'space', 'DVD', 'set', 'better-quality', 'picture', 'commercials', 'had', 'much', 'atmosphere', 'stripped', ""'ll"", 'take', 'tapes', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'Universal', 'senses', 'releases', 'QL', 'unmangled', 'form', 'even', 'more', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'then', 'count', 'out']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Third Season
890772,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B0007UDCX0,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[11, 15]","Despite its short run (March 1989 - May 1993), Quantum Leap is nevertheless one of the more memorable dramatic series in television history. Although the show borrows from a concept employed in other realms, such as Highway To Heaven (with its theme of a mysterious force interceding to transform a single life), it adds a unique twist by utilizing elements of science fiction. Created by Donald P. Bellisario (creator of Magnum, P.I., JAG, and countless other hit shows), Quantum Leap developed a loyal cult following, making its short network run all the more difficult to understand...Quantum Leap stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Samuel ""Sam"" Beckett, a cutting-edge experimental researcher in the field of physics. Developing a theory that an individual can travel throughout the span of his life, Beckett builds the Quantum Leap Accelerator and uses himself as the test subject. But rather than traveling within his own lifetime, Beckett finds himself mysteriously transported into the lives of various individuals, each of whom faces a problem Beckett must rectify (thus changing history for the better). When he does, he can make his next ""quantum leap"" (which he hopes will restore him to his pre-experiment self). Aiding Beckett on his various missions is Rear Admiral Albert ""Al"" Calavicci (Dean Stockwell), one of the quantum leap experiment observers who periodically appears as a hologram in order to communicate with Beckett. With each new episode, Beckett finds himself in a new body, facing new circumstances, with a new mission he must decipher and complete if he ever hopes to return home...The Quantum Leap (Season 3) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere ""The Leap Home"" in which Sam first leaps into his own life, giving him the chance to win his high school basketball championship. Sam then leaps into the lives of other people associated with close family members, as well as those associated with Al, who was a P.O.W. during Vietnam... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Miss Deep South"" in which Sam must come to the aid of a wrongfully disgraced beauty pageant contestant, and ""A Little Miracle"" in which Sam becomes an employee of a wealthy contractor displaying many of the characteristics of a modern day ""Scrooge""...Below is a list of episodes included on the Quantum Leap (Season 3) DVD:Episode 32 (The Leap Home: Part 1 -

My issue is this: I too have had problems with DVD-18s made by Universal, most notably 'Casino' & 'Schindler's List'... the kicker is that the stores will not refund the movie because of copyright laws... they tell you to get another one which freeze and skip also. So due to these problems and Universal's refusal to spend an extra few cents to make another disc(for Ray, Blues Brothers, Cinderella Man, Schindler's List, American Gothic, QL, etc infinity), I am BOYCOTTING Universal DVDs. Warner Bros. stopped making doubled sided disc with 'E.R.' & 'West Wing', why can't Universe-smell do the same thing? simple: MONEY. PROFIT. Send them a message, folks. Because this will be the only way they will listen. I shouldn't have to wonder if a movie is gonna play right when I buy it... simply pathetic.

Season three has what may be the most touching show of the entire series with ""The Leap Home - Part One"" when Sam leaps into himself at the age of 16. And while season three really introduces a more ""politically-correct-social-message"" element to the show (specifically the heavy handed Watts Riot episode), most of the shows still hold up well a decade plus later. ALSO for Friday the 13th fans...in one leap Sam lands in a magician who is struggling to keep his daughter in a custody battle, and his wife is played by Amy Steele from ""Friday the 13th part 2"" and her lawyer/boyfriend is played by Erich Anderson from ""Friday the 14th IV"", which I thought was kind of cool.

If you are fanatical about the show to the point where you are in hysterics because you heard some of the music was changed, buy the DVD anyway and check things out for yourself. I have always been a fan of Quantum Leap and I watched several episodes and I didn't notice which episodes the music had been changed. The DVD's come in a shiny mettalic/hologram inspired box. The three discs are encased in individual cases. The packaging is similar to other recent Universal releases Magnum P.I. The Complete Second Season and Knight Rider Season 2. The 22 episodes are included on dual discs.Die hard Quantum Leap fans will have their favorite episodes. Season 3 opens with the two part fan favorite ""The Leap Home"" Part 1 & 2. In these episode Sam leaps back into his own body at age 16 and tries to change the outcome of his an his families future. There were many popular season 3 episodes. In the episode is ""Glitter Rock,"" Sam leaps into the body of a 1970's rocker named Tonic. The KISS inspired singer is about to meet his death unless Sam can save the day. All of the episodes on the disc include episode descriptions. It is noted in the description for ""Glitter Rock,"" that Sam Bakula does all his own singing for the episode. Another popular episode from this season was ""Last Dance Before Execution,"" in which Sam leaps into the body of a convicted murderer that is hours away from meeting his fate. Sam must prove his innocence.There are no extras or bonus materials, and unlike the other recent Universal releases (The A-Team Season Two, Knight Rider Season Two), there are no episodes from other UNiversal TV on DVD releases. If you are a fan of this show, it will make a great addition to your DVD collection and if you were hesitant to buy the show because of the notation on the back cover ""Music may differ from televised version"" or from what you may have read on other websites, check out the set yourself. In my case, it had been so long since I have seen these episodes, I didn't remember what song appeared in what episode.

Yes, the writing may be the same, the acting may be the same, but the music is not. Anyone who argues that music is not relevant in a film is utterly ignorant and has no artistic appreciation whatsoever. Imagine watching Star Wars sans the Star Wars theme because they couldn't get the rights to have it and replaced it with a generic sounding muzak.

Sure, I don't like the  alterations from the broadcast version of the episodes.

I highly doubt the production company will make "" specical versions"" of the series, but if they do, I might buy those as well.To the companies that release these DVD sets, do you understand why we WANT complete episodes and bonuses?

Bakula began to get more involved, even directed some. And the adventure was in top form. This show deserved all the praise it got back then for being new and innovative. (just think of the QL type clones that have come along since - SLIDERS, PRETENDER, JOHN DOE...)Now to my point of writing here - I noticed that very few people seem to be writing reviews of this season. After all - how could they? The dvds are not out yet and they have no way of knowing what they are reviewing. What people seem to be doing here is just bitching about the previous releases and about Universals attitude towards music rights and packaging.This is supposed to be a review section based on the actual item in questions. An item, none of us have seen yet. I'm just appalled to see people miss-using this section.It's like someone I saw review STAR WARS episode 3, and just bash it calling it crap. How does he know? And I think that if you go into it with that attitude, then you'll find a way to make it self-fulfulling.Just like the people here. You'll hate QL season 3, because you are preparing yourself to hate it.You know what QL is to me? Good writing, good acting, a thoughtful and provocative story that moves me, makes me think... I don't like it for the special features and all the extra bells and whistles. I like it because it is great. Any thing more than the episodes themselves is just bonus.

Friends was always my favourite TV show, and that lost it during the third season. But that's the only one I can really comment on, unless I talk about Lois & Clark etc :)This season starts off with the emotional The Leap Home part one and two. I'd previously seen them before, some random time they were put in, but I don't really connect with them at that point, because it was really my first introduction to Quantum Leap. But with seeing the first two seasons, and actually loving it, I was glad to revisit The Leap Home episodes. I'd stupidly asked when I first started the first season, does he ever leap back into himself? And I got my answer in the first two episodes of this season. He leaps into his sixteen-year-old self, with a dad who's spookily played by Scott Bakula too, who's about to die in a few years, and a brother who's away fighting the war in Vietnam. I did kinda hate this first episode, as Scott plays his own character AND his Dad, which was quite surreal to watch. Very creepy. The second episode, where he has to save his brother from dying was very weird, especially when one of the photos that is taken! I did actually have to rewind this point, to believe what I was actually seeing. Tia Carrere stars in this episode.The rest of the episodes are quite good, and Sam leaps into different people, from a priest who meets the future Sylvester Stallone; to a magician; beauty pageant contestant; to a black man in love with a white girl; an aging motorcyclist (didn't like this episode); an eight and a half months pregnant girl (VERY interesting episode); to a man on Death row and many others.Some of my favourite episodes included 8 & A Half Months, Private Dancer (which features the excellent deaf actress Rhondee Beriault) and a couple of others. Look out for Lauren Tom in Southern Comforts, you will recognise as playing Ross's girlfriend Julie in early episodes of Friends. ALSO look out for Jane Sibbett, who played Ross's ex wife Carole in Friends.The last episode again is very emotional. Sam leaps into a patient at a mental hospital, with a sadistic nurse who gives him electro shock treatment, causing him to get his past leaps muddled and shows Scott's excellent ability to master accents. But it starts to affect his link with Al, who discovers he can also be seen by the other patients in the hospital, and makes up the Alphabet Song. Dean Stockwell rapping? Yes, it has to be seen to be believed! But just as I thought Quantum Leap was starting to get a tad repetitive - well, I won't spoil it for you, but the last scene ends series 3 on a totally different note, and should lead to some laughs in the next series.Speaking of the songs, Scott gets to sing a song in this called ""Somewhere In The Night"", which although not on par with his version of ""Imagine"", is still excellent, and equally haunting.A great season, and I can't wait to see the next series.

I should fight ""the man"" that is Universal, but I was jonesing for some QL.After reviewing many of the arguments here on Amazon.com, I can sympathize with both sides. One, it truly is a shame that the original music was cut out and to me the show just isn't the same without the intended tunes. On the other hand, it's this or nothing. When I watch these episodes with the dubbed muzak, I occasionally lean towards the ""Well, I'd rather have nothing"" attitude. When I watch great episodes like ""Glitter Rock"" and ""Future Boy"" I smile that I am able to watch these episodes commercial free on DVD.The fact is Quantum Leap is a great show without music. It's a brilliant show with the original music in tact. Unfortunately, we will not get what we want and we have to come to terms with that. I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true. We're Quantum Leap geeks and purists that want to relive the leaping experience, uncut in all its glory. Well, Universal doesn't seem to care. QL is just another show to them and another source of funds for their Home Entertainment department (if that's what you want to call it). That's why they just plop it out on shelves with zero TLC. They changed the packaging to slim line cases -- which would have been cool if they had done it in the first place. They botched up the artwork with cutout heads of Sam and Al on bodies from different pictures and included photos in Season 2 taken from Season 4. They gave us double-sided discs for pete's sake and didn't even bother to clean up the picture quality!!! We have a lot to be ticked off about!But what can we do? We've written our letters, voiced our complaints and unless someone knows how to break in and become the Head of Home Entertainment at Universal...we're SOL.I give this season 3 stars instead of 2 (as was given for the 2nd Season) for one reason. On the back on the packaging, there is a disclaimer ""music may differ from televised version"". Thanks for the heads up, Universal. It only took you 3 seasons to tell us, you bunch of jerks!

This is the lesson that was learned with the television show, ""WKRP in Cincinnati.""  When the show originally runs, any non-original music that is played, such as popular songs by famous artists, must be paid for.  The purchase of one-time rights is affordable and quite acceptable for the show's producers.  But buying rights for re-broadcast in perpetuity would cost a small fortune.  That's how song copyright works.  To begin with, the network and producers wouldn't dare gamble that the show is going to be so popular in syndication or DVD release as to justify the vastly increased price.  In addition, however, they would have to probably triple or quadruple the price of DVD sets to cover the expense even if they DID shell out for the rights.  The problem here is purely economic -- NOT artistic.  I'm sure the producers would love to keep the music that aired on the show in tact.

890813,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0007UDCX0,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[82, 86]","""Quantum Leap"" hit its stride during the third season. The show had dramatic episodes just as powerful as season three but this was the most consistent season for this classic TV series. During the third season Sam leaps into a KISS type rock star (complete with dramatic make up and with Scott Bakula doing his own singing!); into himself at 16 where he must change an event in his own past; Sam also leaps into a Navy Seal in Vietnam serving under his older brother where Sam faces a unique dilemma. Is Sam there to save the life of his older brother (who is fated to die the next day), insure the success of the mission or for some other mysterious reason? The series at its best managed to convey the best elements of drama: Sam never knows why he's there and what he has to correct which leads to many emotionally powerful and genuine feeling moments during the third season. What brought the best episodes home were the performances by the series two mainstay performers the marvelous Scott Bakula (""Enterprise"") and acerbic Dean Stockwell as Al who appears only as a hologram and must guide Sam with information from the future.If Sam Beckett had been able to truly leap back through time during his life time he would have been able to foresee the licensing agreement issues that prevent his TV series from having the original music in it and prevented it from being replaced. Some of the original music survives but it depends on how instrumental it was to the episode. By the way, Bakula's nice performance of ""Imagine"" is intact for ""The Leap Home Part I"".Aside from an occasionally grainy or soft episode, ""Quantum Leap"" looks exceptional here. While there are still analog flaws in the form of occasional dirt and irregularities in the prints used, the colors are bright, image quality sharp and vivid (with the exception of those episodes using stock footage). The 2.0 stereo soundtrack also sounds quite crisp and vivid. Dialogue is, for the most part, very clear and the music comes across with nice presence.I was hoping that Sam would figure out how to hide some extras from the past for Universal to find when transferring this to DVD. We get an episode guide on disc three that lists which episodes are on which discs (which might be an extra if it served any useful purpose such as having trivia about each episode). We get an onscreen synopsis for each episode before playing the episode and a synopsis on the back of each slimline DVD holder. The big difference here is the redesigned packaging. Gone are the accordion holders which threatened to scratch the dual layered, dual sided discs for each season. Instead, we get individual slimline holders for each disc along with a synopsis on the back of the holder giving a brief description of each episode (much like the DVD version included as well). Missing, however, are some of the promo photos that adorned the accordion style holders. I miss them. It's a pity that Universal chose not to adorn the inside of the paper sleeves in each slim line holder with photos for the inside.  It does appear that these are the uncut original episodes as they aired on NBC.This is an area where Universal continues to lag behind just about every studio. Would it have hurt Universal to provide commentary by Scott Bakula (particularly since he recently filmed a cameo for the new ""Quantum Leap"" TV show), Dean Stockwell (he appears in the new show as a regular) or even creator Bellisario? ""The Leap Home"" parts 1 and 2 would have been a perfect set for commentary tracks.""Quantum Leap"" continues to look nice in its DVD transfer but it seems that Universal is rushing out ""product"" which really does a disservice to the fans. This particularly set was designed to coincide with the release of ""Enterprise"" on DVD and the last two episodes of ""Enterprise"" airing on UPN. Synergy can be everything but it can also add up to nothing particularly when ""product"" is rushed out to meet a predestined release date or tie in. Universal, please do it right for the last two sets of the series. This fine series and its fans deserve better.",5,5 star season,1116028800,"05 14, 2005",2005,4096,"['Quantum', 'Leap', 'hit', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'show', 'had', 'dramatic', 'episodes', 'just', 'as', 'powerful', 'season', 'three', 'was', 'most', 'consistent', 'season', 'classic', 'TV', 'series', 'third', 'season', 'Sam', 'KISS', 'type', 'rock', 'star', 'complete', 'dramatic', 'make', 'up', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'doing', 'own', 'singing', '16', 'where', 'must', 'change', 'event', 'own', 'past', 'Sam', 'also', 'Navy', 'Seal', 'Vietnam', 'serving', 'older', 'brother', 'where', 'Sam', 'unique', 'dilemma', 'Sam', 'there', 'save', 'life', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'fated', 'die', 'next', 'day', 'insure', 'success', 'mission', 'other', 'mysterious', 'reason', 'series', 'best', 'managed', 'convey', 'best', 'elements', 'drama', 'Sam', 'never', 'why', 'there', 'what', 'correct', 'many', 'emotionally', 'powerful', 'genuine', 'feeling', 'moments', 'third', 'season', 'What', 'brought', 'best', 'episodes', 'home', 'were', 'performances', 'series', 'two', 'mainstay', 'performers', 'marvelous', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'Enterprise', 'acerbic', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Al', 'who', 'only', 'hologram', 'must', 'guide', 'Sam', 'information', 'future.If', 'Sam', 'Beckett', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'truly', 'leap', 'back', 'time', 'life', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'foresee', 'licensing', 'agreement', 'issues', 'prevent', 'TV', 'series', 'having', 'original', 'music', 'prevented', 'being', 'replaced', 'original', 'music', 'how', 'instrumental', 'was', 'episode', 'way', 'Bakula', 'nice', 'performance', 'Imagine', 'intact', 'Leap', 'Home', 'Part', '.Aside', 'occasionally', 'grainy', 'soft', 'episode', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'exceptional', 'here', 'are', 'still', 'analog', 'flaws', 'form', 'occasional', 'dirt', 'irregularities', 'prints', 'used', 'colors', 'are', 'bright', 'image', 'quality', 'sharp', 'vivid', 'exception', 'episodes', 'using', 'stock', 'footage', '2.0', 'stereo', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'quite', 'crisp', 'vivid', 'Dialogue', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'clear', 'music', 'nice', 'presence.I', 'was', 'hoping', 'Sam', 'would', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'hide', 'extras', 'past', 'Universal', 'find', 'when', 'transferring', 'DVD', 'get', 'episode', 'guide', 'disc', 'three', 'lists', 'episodes', 'are', 'discs', 'might', 'be', 'extra', 'served', 'useful', 'purpose', 'such', 'having', 'trivia', 'episode', 'get', 'onscreen', 'synopsis', 'episode', 'playing', 'episode', 'synopsis', 'back', 'slimline', 'DVD', 'holder', 'big', 'difference', 'here', 'redesigned', 'packaging', 'Gone', 'are', 'accordion', 'holders', 'threatened', 'scratch', 'dual', 'layered', 'dual', 'sided', 'discs', 'season', 'Instead', 'get', 'individual', 'slimline', 'holders', 'disc', 'synopsis', 'back', 'holder', 'giving', 'brief', 'description', 'episode', 'much', 'DVD', 'version', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'Missing', 'however', 'are', 'promo', 'photos', 'adorned', 'accordion', 'style', 'holders', 'miss', 'pity', 'Universal', 'chose', 'not', 'adorn', 'inside', 'paper', 'slim', 'line', 'holder', 'photos', 'inside', 'appear', 'are', 'uncut', 'original', 'episodes', 'aired', 'NBC.This', 'area', 'where', 'Universal', 'lag', 'behind', 'just', 'studio', 'Would', 'have', 'hurt', 'Universal', 'provide', 'commentary', 'Scott', 'Bakula', 'particularly', 'recently', 'filmed', 'cameo', 'new', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'TV', 'show', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'new', 'show', 'regular', 'even', 'creator', 'Bellisario', 'Leap', 'Home', 'parts', '1', '2', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'set', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'Quantum', 'Leap', 'look', 'nice', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'Universal', 'rushing', 'out', 'product', 'really', 'disservice', 'fans', 'particularly', 'set', 'was', 'designed', 'coincide', 'release', 'Enterprise', 'DVD', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'Enterprise', 'airing', 'UPN', 'Synergy', 'can', 'be', 'everything', 'can', 'also', 'add', 'up', 'nothing', 'particularly', 'when', 'product', 'rushed', 'meet', 'predestined', 'release', 'date', 'tie', 'Universal', 'please', 'do', 'right', 'last', 'two', 'sets', 'series', 'fine', 'series', 'fans', 'deserve', 'better']",Quantum Leap: The Complete Third Season
