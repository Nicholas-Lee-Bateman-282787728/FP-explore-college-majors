The film has all the advantages of a reality show--it's ""real""--but also some of the drawbacks--""why are these people taking this so seriously?""  If you're curious about the occult or the possibility of literally selling yourself to Satan, this DVD might be for you.  Obviously some of the participants believe this is possible, while others--like the attorney who draws up the pact--are going along as a goof only.  The fact that the lead ""seller"" isn't all that sure only lends credibility to the proceedings.  There's also a discussion with a variety of ""experts"" about what ""selling your soul"" really means.  It's hip, cool stuff, stylish and interesting and there's enough paraphernalia and witchcraft to be intriguing.  The LA scene is the backdrop, which gives a sunny ordinariness to the devilish doings, a nice contrast.  The lead character seems to want to be a rock star in order to ride around in limos and be recognized by others, but in typical fashion, he never picks up a guitar or sings a note.  The last act turns a little more serious and asks the question, ""what if this is real?"" which is nicely scary and creepy.  A good effort.",3,The Ultimate Reality Show,1320796800,"11 9, 2011",2011,1257,"['intriguing', 'idea', 'documentary/reality', 'show', 'idea', 'selling', 'soul', 'Devil', 'film', 'advantages', 'reality', 'show', 'real', 'also', 'drawbacks', 'why', 'are', 'people', 'taking', 'so', 'seriously', ""'re"", 'curious', 'occult', 'possibility', 'literally', 'selling', 'Satan', 'DVD', 'might', 'be', 'Obviously', 'participants', 'believe', 'possible', 'others', 'attorney', 'who', 'up', 'pact', 'are', 'going', 'along', 'goof', 'only', 'fact', 'lead', 'seller', ""n't"", 'sure', 'only', 'credibility', 'proceedings', 'also', 'discussion', 'variety', 'experts', 'what', 'selling', 'soul', 'really', 'hip', 'cool', 'stuff', 'stylish', 'interesting', 'enough', 'paraphernalia', 'witchcraft', 'be', 'intriguing', 'LA', 'scene', 'backdrop', 'sunny', 'ordinariness', 'devilish', 'doings', 'nice', 'contrast', 'lead', 'character', 'want', 'be', 'rock', 'star', 'order', 'ride', 'limos', 'be', 'recognized', 'others', 'typical', 'fashion', 'never', 'up', 'guitar', 'sings', 'note', 'last', 'act', 'little', 'more', 'serious', 'question', 'what', 'real', 'nicely', 'scary', 'creepy', 'good', 'effort']",I Sold My Soul To Satan
