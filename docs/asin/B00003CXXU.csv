540787,A1VKEVP3GO1G9R,B00003CXXU,Aaron Amos,"[1, 2]","This movie came out last summer. It has a all star cast, but the story is pathetic! This movie did not need to be remade for today's kids! The story starts out as Mark Wahlberg is training a ape to fly a spaceship. After that the ape goes though a strange outer space thing. Wahlberg follows the ape. in the orginal movie with Heston, he and his fellow spacemen were asleep for thousands of years.Wahlberg lands on planet. It is the planet of the apes. There has been many changes that never took place in the first movie.One of the biggest changes is the humans here talk(in the original movie ,humans were mute!). I will not go into detail as I'm sure that the other reviews already tore this movie apart.The only good things is a tons of special effects and the ape make-up! Other than that this movie was a remake that did not need to be done! The ending was funny as I expect Fox to make a sequel to this over $100 million unworthy remake!Rent this movie first unless you are a fan of the original movie,a fan of Tim Burton's dark movies,or a fans of this movie's stars! This movie was one of 2001's worst movies for me to watch!Watch this original instesd of this remake as the issues the first movie talks about are still valid today.

540791,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00003CXXU,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[4, 4]","I refused to watch the remake of Planet of the Apes on principal when it first came out, but finally saw it.  The special effects are good, the Tim Burton world created is dark, atmospheric, and creative, but the plot is another story.It's good that they didn't take this too seriously and injected much camp into it.  Marky Mark's first encounter with an ape has the ape saying, &quot;Get your hands off me, you damn dirty human!&quot;, a reference to the original.  Another is with Charleton Heston playing General Thane's (Tim Roth's) ape father and referring to humans, &quot;Damn them all to hell!&quot;  A warrior ape &quot;borrows&quot; Barry Goldwater's 1964 line, &quot;Extremism in the name of apes is no vice&quot;, but this line is obscure enough to make it a rip-off rather than a nod.The plot is this:  Marky Mark is on a space station in the year 2029 (that's plausible) training chimps to do work in space.He enters a magnetic storm and goes through a time warp landing on a planet where they speak English, yet doesn't make the connection to Earth (in the original it was Heston himself who argued for English, even though inconsistent, more accessible).  In this one even the humans speak English.  Helena Bonham Carter portrays a &quot;human rights&quot; ape while her human counterpart Estella Warren usually just fills out the background scenery.  Kris Kristopherson (Me and Bobby McGee) plays her father.  Inconsistencies abound.One is Carter helping Marky to escape and he asks why: &quot;Because...you...uh...er...different&quot;  I'm not joking, this is the explanation she gives.  And to capture 4 escaped humans the whole ape army is mobilized.  Roth has some incredible temper tantrums monkey jumping all over the place.  Carter does some good &quot;hoo,hoo, hoo, hoos&quot; to intersperse her poor dialogue, and the gorillas have these ultra-deep monster voices.  They worship Semus the first ape, and when Marky's chimp comes in a spaceship they bow down to him thinking he's Semus.  But Roth is a progenitor of Semus and the top Gorilla is convinced by Marky that Semus actually &quot;killed them all&quot;.  So the whole culture is changed and apes and humans are ever after fully equal on the planet....no I can't follow it either.  And another human ship lands to look for Marky, but the experimental apes on the ship take over and start the whole ape civilization.  I won't give the &quot;surprise&quot; ending away, but suffice it to say we're dealing with alternate worlds here.Again, eee the far superior original, and wait for Hollywood to come up with something new rather than accepting mediocre remakes.",2,"Not quite as bad as I thought, but original  towers over it",1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,2645,"['refused', 'watch', 'remake', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'principal', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'finally', 'saw', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'world', 'created', 'dark', 'atmospheric', 'creative', 'plot', 'story.It', 'good', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'injected', 'much', 'camp', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'first', 'encounter', 'ape', 'ape', 'saying', 'quot', 'Get', 'hands', 'damn', 'dirty', 'human', 'quot', 'reference', 'original', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'playing', 'General', 'Thane', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'ape', 'father', 'referring', 'humans', 'quot', 'Damn', 'hell', 'quot', 'A', 'warrior', 'ape', 'quot', 'quot', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', '1964', 'line', 'quot', 'Extremism', 'name', 'apes', 'vice', 'quot', 'line', 'obscure', 'enough', 'make', 'rip-off', 'rather', 'nod.The', 'plot', 'Marky', 'Mark', 'space', 'station', 'year', '2029', 'plausible', 'training', 'chimps', 'do', 'work', 'space.He', 'enters', 'magnetic', 'storm', 'time', 'warp', 'landing', 'planet', 'where', 'speak', 'English', 'yet', ""n't"", 'make', 'connection', 'Earth', 'original', 'was', 'Heston', 'who', 'argued', 'English', 'even', 'inconsistent', 'more', 'accessible', 'one', 'even', 'humans', 'speak', 'English', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'quot', 'human', 'rights', 'quot', 'ape', 'human', 'counterpart', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'usually', 'just', 'out', 'background', 'scenery', 'Kris', 'Kristopherson', 'Me', 'Bobby', 'McGee', 'father', 'Inconsistencies', 'abound.One', 'Carter', 'helping', 'Marky', 'escape', 'why', 'quot', 'uh', 'er', 'different', 'quot', ""'m"", 'not', 'joking', 'explanation', 'capture', '4', 'escaped', 'humans', 'whole', 'ape', 'army', 'mobilized', 'Roth', 'incredible', 'temper', 'tantrums', 'monkey', 'jumping', 'place', 'Carter', 'good', 'quot', 'hoo', 'hoo', 'hoo', 'hoos', 'quot', 'intersperse', 'poor', 'dialogue', 'gorillas', 'have', 'ultra-deep', 'monster', 'voices', 'worship', 'Semus', 'first', 'ape', 'when', 'Marky', 'chimp', 'spaceship', 'bow', 'down', 'thinking', 'Semus', 'Roth', 'progenitor', 'Semus', 'top', 'Gorilla', 'convinced', 'Marky', 'Semus', 'actually', 'quot', 'killed', 'quot', 'whole', 'culture', 'changed', 'apes', 'humans', 'are', 'ever', 'fully', 'equal', 'planet', '.no', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'human', 'ship', 'look', 'Marky', 'experimental', 'apes', 'ship', 'take', 'start', 'whole', 'ape', 'civilization', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'quot', 'surprise', 'quot', 'ending', 'away', 'say', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'alternate', 'worlds', 'here.Again', 'eee', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'wait', 'Hollywood', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'rather', 'accepting', 'mediocre', 'remakes']",N/A
540792,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00003CXXU,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[2, 2]","First off, a commendation to those responsible for dvd production. Though slightly repetitive, the two disks have all the fact's needed to be a planet-ite. I have said many times before that when something is created to display a world of its own there is no room for speculation. Unfortunately with Apes pluses come many, many minuses.Pluses: Tim Roth, completely disappearing and submerging into the dark, evil Thade, carries the entire film on his shoulder's. Applause to costume, art, make-up, stunt coordination, and FX department's. If your soul purpose in seeing Planet is the visionary, then be prepared for many new and improved distinction's. Micheal Clark Duncan seperates himself from his Green Mile counterpart to portray Thade's right hand general in warfare. Helena Bodham Carter (stunning in Hamlet, incredible in The Theory of Flight) plays a daughter of councel, and is perhaps the most attractive ape ever on the screen. Danny Elfman pulls of yet another unique and jungle-like soundtrack full of rhythm's and vicious war music. Once you see how Tim Burton placed Planet on Celluloid you will see a reason to appreciate the terrific editing.Minuses: The screenwriter('s) need to be choked for the absolute and obvious denial of the human character's. There are three main character's that, I don't even know if they were named, have no real purpose whatsoever. When watching the scenes with Wahlberg running away with Carter in the escape scenes, these pointless humans tag along and provide nothing for the film. They are needless. A boy, fiesty as all boys are in a jungle setting, stays through the entire picture only to be trapped beneath a horse at the end for a photo opportunity of a fleet of on-coming apes. The &quot;lead&quot; female doesn't say two words, only looks at Wahlberg as if he should mate with her, and hurts her feelings when he pays more attention to the Carter character. That's all she's supposed to do right? Why not cut two minutes out of the film and not have her at all? She is there to look concerned. Period. Her Father, played well, get's killed off in a supposedly tear jerking off-camera slaughter. Why? To slow the bad apes down of course. Unfortunately the other character's do not understand this, as they watch his fate unfold nearly to the last second. How long does one fragile old man pospone the demise of his daughter, Wahlberg, and the other's? Nearly an entire second! Cheers! But ofcourse how does he know this, when he has been seeing their power for the entire length of his life. How many apes is he trying to &quot;hold back&quot;? About a hundred. Noble jesture, but as J. Cricket says, &quot;Not at all logical.&quot; There are other human's too, but you only get glimpses of them as they are systematically killed off.Not even Wahlberg get's a word in. Atleast in the original Heston had a good excuse to remain silent, he was shot in the throat. The dialogue throughout the entire film lacks both spine and brain. Perhaps someone pulled a fatality on the intellect department.The lowest Minus - The kicker...the absolute kicker of this entire movie: Near the end Wahlberg, Carter, and the unimportant characters must rendezvous with his returning ship. They are fairly close when they come to a camp filled with Ape soldiers and red tent's. Now, this encampment is surrounded by very small hills, more like humps. A five minute walk to Alabama boys. Anyway, it is suggested to Wahlberg that they...&quot;go around&quot;...the camp and safely cross a creek. He will have nothing of it. &quot;No,&quot; he says, &quot;it will take too much time. We will wait until nightfall and steal their horses and ride straight through the center of the camp.&quot; They do this, but before breaking out and riding in a screaming rage, Wahlberg pop's a bright red flair over the camp, just in case there is any doubt of the Apes knowing that they are coming. Along the way he manages to destroy the entire camp with two torches. FATALITY!Planet of the Apes visually, along with Roth, Duncan, and Carter, is a terrific grade &quot;A&quot; film. But when you Add all of the many mind blowing fault's, it's grade drops severely. Another example of matter over brains. It's too bad, because there was so much work placed in this film.",2,"Snarling, Biting, and Burton...",1008028800,"12 11, 2001",2001,4291,"['First', 'off', 'commendation', 'responsible', 'dvd', 'production', 'slightly', 'repetitive', 'two', 'disks', 'have', 'fact', 'needed', 'be', 'planet-ite', 'have', 'said', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'something', 'created', 'display', 'world', 'own', 'room', 'speculation', 'Unfortunately', 'Apes', 'come', 'many', 'many', 'minuses.Pluses', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'completely', 'disappearing', 'submerging', 'dark', 'evil', 'Thade', 'entire', 'film', 'shoulder', 'Applause', 'costume', 'art', 'make-up', 'stunt', 'coordination', 'FX', 'department', 'soul', 'purpose', 'seeing', 'Planet', 'visionary', 'then', 'be', 'prepared', 'many', 'new', 'improved', 'distinction', 'Micheal', 'Clark', 'Duncan', 'Green', 'Mile', 'counterpart', 'portray', 'Thade', 'right', 'hand', 'general', 'warfare', 'Helena', 'Bodham', 'Carter', 'stunning', 'Hamlet', 'incredible', 'Theory', 'Flight', 'daughter', 'councel', 'perhaps', 'most', 'attractive', 'ape', 'ever', 'screen', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'yet', 'unique', 'jungle-like', 'soundtrack', 'full', 'rhythm', 'vicious', 'war', 'music', 'Once', 'see', 'how', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'placed', 'Planet', 'Celluloid', 'will', 'see', 'reason', 'appreciate', 'terrific', 'editing.Minuses', 'screenwriter', 'need', 'be', 'choked', 'absolute', 'obvious', 'denial', 'human', 'character', 'are', 'three', 'main', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'were', 'named', 'have', 'real', 'purpose', 'whatsoever', 'When', 'watching', 'scenes', 'Wahlberg', 'running', 'away', 'Carter', 'escape', 'scenes', 'pointless', 'humans', 'tag', 'along', 'provide', 'nothing', 'film', 'are', 'needless', 'boy', 'fiesty', 'boys', 'are', 'jungle', 'setting', 'entire', 'picture', 'only', 'be', 'trapped', 'horse', 'end', 'photo', 'opportunity', 'fleet', 'on-coming', 'apes', 'quot', 'quot', 'female', ""n't"", 'say', 'two', 'words', 'only', 'Wahlberg', 'should', 'mate', 'feelings', 'when', 'more', 'attention', 'Carter', 'character', 'supposed', 'do', 'right', 'Why', 'not', 'cut', 'two', 'minutes', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'there', 'look', 'concerned', 'Period', 'Father', 'played', 'well', 'get', 'killed', 'off', 'supposedly', 'tear', 'jerking', 'off-camera', 'slaughter', 'Why', 'slow', 'bad', 'apes', 'course', 'Unfortunately', 'other', 'character', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'watch', 'fate', 'unfold', 'nearly', 'last', 'second', 'How', 'long', 'one', 'fragile', 'old', 'man', 'demise', 'daughter', 'Wahlberg', 'other', 'Nearly', 'entire', 'second', 'Cheers', 'ofcourse', 'how', 'know', 'when', 'been', 'seeing', 'power', 'entire', 'length', 'life', 'How', 'many', 'apes', 'trying', 'quot', 'hold', 'back', 'quot', 'hundred', 'Noble', 'jesture', 'J.', 'Cricket', 'quot', 'Not', 'logical.', 'quot', 'are', 'other', 'human', 'too', 'only', 'get', 'glimpses', 'are', 'systematically', 'killed', 'off.Not', 'even', 'Wahlberg', 'get', 'word', 'Atleast', 'original', 'Heston', 'had', 'good', 'excuse', 'remain', 'silent', 'was', 'shot', 'throat', 'dialogue', 'entire', 'film', 'spine', 'brain', 'Perhaps', 'someone', 'pulled', 'fatality', 'intellect', 'department.The', 'lowest', 'Minus', 'kicker', 'absolute', 'kicker', 'entire', 'movie', 'end', 'Wahlberg', 'Carter', 'unimportant', 'characters', 'must', 'rendezvous', 'returning', 'ship', 'are', 'fairly', 'close', 'when', 'come', 'camp', 'filled', 'Ape', 'soldiers', 'red', 'tent', 'Now', 'encampment', 'surrounded', 'very', 'small', 'hills', 'more', 'humps', 'five', 'minute', 'walk', 'Alabama', 'boys', 'Anyway', 'suggested', 'Wahlberg', 'quot', 'go', 'quot', 'camp', 'safely', 'cross', 'creek', 'will', 'have', 'nothing', 'quot', 'No', 'quot', 'quot', 'will', 'take', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'will', 'wait', 'steal', 'horses', 'ride', 'straight', 'center', 'camp.', 'quot', 'do', 'breaking', 'out', 'riding', 'screaming', 'rage', 'Wahlberg', 'pop', 'bright', 'red', 'flair', 'camp', 'just', 'case', 'doubt', 'Apes', 'knowing', 'are', 'coming', 'way', 'destroy', 'entire', 'camp', 'two', 'torches', 'FATALITY', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'visually', 'Roth', 'Duncan', 'Carter', 'terrific', 'grade', 'quot', 'A', 'quot', 'film', 'when', 'Add', 'many', 'mind', 'blowing', 'fault', 'grade', 'drops', 'severely', 'example', 'matter', 'brains', 'too', 'bad', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'work', 'placed', 'film']",N/A

I dont know why you would remake a movie and then dispense with many qualities that made the original great.I recently picked up a copy and wanted to give the film a second chance. I have to say for those who have not seen the original it is an adequate Sci Fi adventure movie. The make up and costumes are very well done. However, as a Planet of the Apes movie it is a travesty. Beloved characters, who have withstood the test of time, are gone and they are replaced with a collection instantly forgettable characters. As an example, the original's Dt. Zaius, had a good reason to hate humans, he feared mankinds destructive nature, is replaced by Thade who has no motivation for his hatred. Gone is the plot, this movie is basically one long chase scene. However, None of the action sequances come close to the original's hunt or the chase thru Ape City.

Only his status as womanizing (apenizing?) inclinations are out of place.Granted, the movie is pretty shallow and superficial as far as some deep philosophical message goes, but that's to be expected from something designed as pure entertainment. At least I have never been able to find any evidence that it was made with other purpose in mind. As a pure escapist fun - the Dan Brown type - it is, within its severe limitations, a fine movie.The one star down is entirely due to the finale - I mean the very end, not the charming twist with the time before (which was clever). I was both delighted and disappointed to hear the commentary of Tim Burton and realise that even he himself doesn't have any kind of explanation except that he 'had no problem with it'. But I do. It cannot be denied that the finale is a huge surprise - you just don't see it coming - but when, after the shock, you come to think of it, you cannot but see that it is completely impossible, even in a science fiction (fantasy?) movie.

540799,AFXTPJOE2D4M3,B00003CXXU,Algernon D'Ammassa,"[0, 0]","On the plus side, Tim Burton's remake of PLANET OF THE APES is a technological achievement.  Rick Baker's amazing makeup transforms actors into apes without losing their faces (and, thus, their own performances).  With the exception of David Warner (as the elderly ape senator), none of the apes feel like actors walking around with masks on.  These apes have articulated feet; they can leap and climb with dizzying speed.This opens up a lot of vocabulary in the action scenes - chases through the woods are surprising and scary; the apes are everywhere and they are very strong.  (A little too strong for us to believe Mark Wahlberg can take the beatings he does.)  The fights have a brutal quality, but the emphasis is all on impact and speed - there is very little gore.There is no excuse for the lousy character development.  The film is constantly bringing our attention to parallels between the ape planet and our own society.  (At one point, an ape even quotes Barry Goldwater.)  Yet there is very little emotional impact or change in the characters.  Histories and relationships are suggested but never developed.  The sacrifices seem inconsequential rather than heroic.  A sexy blonde jiggles along with the hero, but no romantic situation develops, or any real storyline at all.  Is she just eye candy for the dads?  It seems like a pointless, almost demeaning bit of baggage.  Give her something to do in the story!Mark Wahlberg is hunky and personable, but not distinctive or divided in any way.  When he rouses the humans to fight the apes, the speech is far from &quot;St. Crispin's day&quot; - lacking in rouse or commitment, it is yet another dramatic event that doesn't really take place.  If the human interactions are less realistic than the special effects, something is very wrong!Without any real drama, the movie feels preachy.  The handgun is introduced as the single corrupting influence of human culture.  The ending is also very heavy on commentary, but fails as storytelling and will leave many moviegoers baffled.Fans of composer Danny Elfman will not be disappointed - this is one of his most dynamic and versatile scores ever, utilizing a full symphony, african and electronic drums, musically conveying the heat and pulse of the jungle, the jackboots and terror of war, and the majesty of space.

I believe the story is very consistent with a good moral.  The main difference between this Planet of the Apes and the 1968 version is: Charelton Heston, I think Heston did much better than Whalberg did in this film.  Heston played the role of a victim so perfectly with his insulting and mean comments towards Dr. Zaius which were classic, and you could sympothize with the charocter.  Whalberg did a decent job, but you could not sense the same amount of anger is Whalberg as in Heston.  The ending I thought was good.

In this version, the astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) is captured and becomes a house slave to an inveterate liberal and animal-rights activist (Helena Bonham-Carter).  With this &quot;human-lover's&quot; help, the other slave/humans in town break out of town and head for the mysterious land which they have been forbidden to enter, on the theory that there must be something useful there.The special effects are marvelous.  I consider the apes' town a touch of genius; it's set on a high hill surrounded by flat slate.  The effect is a kind of jungle Mount St. Michel.  This movie uses facial prostheses rather than rubber masks for the apes' faces, so we can see a little of the human beneath (look for Charleton Heston in a cameo as a guiding patriarch).As with Heston's appearance, in-jokes to the original &quot;Apes&quot; movies and to racism and animal-rights advocates abound.  Humans are considered the highest type of animal but still an animal.  At one dinner party an exasperated guests blurts out &quot;Can't we just all get along?&quot;  There is a great deal more humor in that vein.  Somehow, though, the dialog stops just short of camp.While I consider this a good movie, it is certainly no classic.  It needed a less stereotyped plot and possibly a stronger male lead than Wahlberg, who seems to be at his best in ensemble drama like &quot;The Perfect Storm.&quot;  But if you liked the original, or enjoy fantasy movies in general, this new &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is entertaining.",4,&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; Is Good But Not Great,996537600,"07 31, 2001",2001,1667,"['new', '2001', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'original', 'premise', 'spaceman', 'planet', 'controlled', 'apes', 'who', 'dominate', 'humans', 'own', 'story', 'version', 'astronaut', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'captured', 'house', 'slave', 'inveterate', 'liberal', 'animal-rights', 'activist', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'quot', 'human-lover', 'quot', 'help', 'other', 'slave/humans', 'town', 'break', 'town', 'head', 'mysterious', 'land', 'have', 'been', 'forbidden', 'enter', 'theory', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'useful', 'there.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'marvelous', 'consider', 'apes', 'town', 'touch', 'genius', 'set', 'high', 'hill', 'surrounded', 'flat', 'slate', 'effect', 'kind', 'jungle', 'Mount', 'St.', 'Michel', 'movie', 'facial', 'prostheses', 'rather', 'rubber', 'masks', 'apes', 'can', 'see', 'little', 'human', 'beneath', 'look', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'cameo', 'guiding', 'patriarch', '.As', 'Heston', 'appearance', 'in-jokes', 'original', 'quot', 'Apes', 'quot', 'movies', 'racism', 'animal-rights', 'advocates', 'abound', 'Humans', 'are', 'considered', 'highest', 'type', 'animal', 'still', 'animal', 'one', 'dinner', 'party', 'exasperated', 'guests', 'out', 'quot', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'get', 'quot', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'humor', 'vein', 'Somehow', 'though', 'dialog', 'just', 'short', 'camp.While', 'consider', 'good', 'movie', 'certainly', 'classic', 'needed', 'less', 'stereotyped', 'plot', 'possibly', 'stronger', 'male', 'lead', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'be', 'best', 'ensemble', 'drama', 'quot', 'Perfect', 'Storm.', 'quot', 'liked', 'original', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'movies', 'general', 'new', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'entertaining']",N/A

For the most part it was a very engaging film, with only a few misconceived dips into the low-brow humor barrel, which had the unfortunate effect of bursting the suspension-of-disbelief bubble so essential to going along with a movie like this. (""Okay, evolved, talking apes. Respect them. Fear them. Believe them. Okay. Oh, lookit that ape! Isn't that cute? Isn't that ridiculous? Oh, wait. Respect them. Fear them. Right."")Some of the acting was brilliant. Not, sadly, Mark Wahlberg's--not unless Burton directed him to act like he was sleepwalking, in which case he did that masterfully.  But Tim Roth pulled off his role very convincingly, in spite of what was essentially a really non-threatening appearance.  Oh, I don't doubt that enraged chimps in the wild are very frightening, but we've seen too many of these guys hamming it up on t.v. for me to really find them awesome in their native aspect. Kudos to Tim. Kudos, too, to Helena Bonham Carter, who even managed to minimize the disadvantage of a ludicrous 'do. Her performance was outstanding. She did the ape routine without making it seem camp--alas, more than some of her fellow simians could do.What drags this movie down primarily are the plot problems.  People make stupid decisions.

If you want to see a movie about an astronaut trapped on a world filled with talking apes, why not just watch the classic?Nonetheless, I decided to give this movie a shot in the theater when it came out.There has been plenty of criticism of the ending--and it is richly deserved, in my opinion.  Despite the fact that it is much closer to how Pierre Boule ended the novel than the 1968 version did, it is still much, much weaker than Charlton Heston on the beach.I also had a real problem with the apes.  I thought they looked less like apes than the original ones did.  If nothing else, that part of the effects should have improved in the decades since the original films were made.  Instead, they looked like big muppets--for the most part.  (The newer ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" does not share this problem--nor is it a bad film).This film just wasn't enjoyable in very many ways at all for me.  If you like Tim Burton movies generally, you may feel differently.  I never have been much of a fan of his.It's a weak story, badly put on, that adds nothing to the original stories.

Mark Wahlberg is the reluctant astronaut who crash lands on a mysterious alien planet that turns out to be ruled by genetically advanced apes who talk, reason and viciously rule the humans around them. Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as the aristocratic ape who feels the humans deserve equal rights, and Tim Roth couldn't be more effective as the power hungry general who fascisticly rules Ape City with an iron fist, determined to keep humans under his control forever. Wahlberg, however, changes all that, boiling the film down to a fantastic battle climax and a shock ending that while shamelessly leaving miles of room for a sequel is spine-tingling all the same. Perhaps not as politically poignant as the original version, this one still cannot be accused of dumbing down the story in any way; rather, it does a very good job of addressing different issues (zeal for power) than the ones that were controversial subjects upon its original's release (civil rights, not that those aren't important anymore, just not as contestable).

540838,A2B2QQ05PHVRKT,B00003CXXU,Brian Himes,"[10, 16]","Ok, when I first heard about a remake of the classic Planet of the Apes film, the first question that came to my mind was: why? What is the point? If it was just to update the now dated ape make-up and special effects, then I was of the opinion it shouldn't be done. Now, if on the other hand, the updated film was going to be used to address more current race and social issues of the day, then fine. However, even thinking along those lines I still couldn't see any good reason to remake Planet of the Apes. The original 1968 film is still relevant today as it was in the 60's.Then I heard it was not a remake but a re-imagining. At that point I was outraged. The original Planet of the Apes is one of my all time favorite movies and to mess with it was just wrong in my opinion.However, since I do like several Tim Burton films, I was at least going to give the film a chance. So, to prepare for the film, I read the book for the first time and rewatched the original film. Ok, after reading the book I could see where there was room for a re-interpretation of the material. So, I was willing to give the new Planet of the Apes a chance.My best friend and I went to see it together. He bought the tickets because I just flatly refused to pay for it in any way. I still had the feeling that it was going to be a disaster.It was. The first problem that I had was, I just don't understand how you can make a movie based on a book and not have ONE single character from the book in the movie. Where was Dr. Zira? Where was Dr. Zaius? Where was Cornelius? At that point I wrote the whole film off. I don't know what this film is but it isn't Planet of the Apes. In fact, I refuse to even call it that to this very day.The acting is terrible. The characters (whomever they are) are dull, boring card board cut outs that just seem to slosh their way through their scenes and dialogue. The film goes no where and worse than that, it has NOTHING to say. At least not anything that wasn't said 500 times better in the original film. This is movie making at it lowest. To desecrate a classic film that actually tried to have something to say about our world and the prejudice in it, and re-imagine it and spit out this deplorable piece of garbage is a travesty.Shame on everyone involved with this film. Avoid this film at all costs. Watch the original. It's a superior film in spite of the dated ape make-ups. If I had the time and a hammer, I'd like to destory every copy of this film. Long live the original Planet of the Apes.3/3/08: I recently saw this film again for the first time since it was in the theatre, and I stand by my review.

In some ways, it's even more faithful to the famous Pierre Boulle novel.The real star of this piece is the ape effects, which are incredible.  The 1968 version had man-apes  -  this version has ape-men.  They bounce furiously about in wild acrobatics, handle objects with their feet, and very convincingly come off as actual erect, linguistically capable apes.The performances are all pretty good, though they take a back seat to the effects  -  ape and otherwise.  Tim Roth as the evil chimpanzee general after human astronaut Mark Wahlberg is the best of the lot, with Helena Bonham Carter as Wahlberg's unlikely but fascinating love-interest coming in a close second.  Charlton Heston has a fabulous cameo, as the one ape with previous knowledge of the former superior race of men preceding ape civilization.The story is closer in most regards to Boulle's novel, including the clever twist ending  -  which, of course, sets up the sequel.  But the less said about it the better, for those intending to see it.  Suffice it to say it's quite well done.Even if you weren't a fan of the original movie or novel, you'll find plenty in this film to keep your attention.

One with complicated characters, underlying stories, swelling music.Planet of the Apes 2001 is not an epic, and it's certainly lacking compared to the original.Some examples:a) The classic first line uttered by Heston,in the original,to the apes was - &quot;Get your stinking paws off me, you d***ed dirty ape!&quot;. The 2001 version manages to fit it in the movie with a twist, but pulls it off as just a gimmick.b) Numerous underlying attacks on Christianity run throughout. Burton has publicly stated his disdain for organized religion, and apparently used this movie as his podium.The &quot;bad&quot; apes pray to their &quot;Heavenly father&quot; ape. Talk of the &quot;return&quot; and prophesies about the &quot;god-ape&quot; pepper the conversations quite frequently. The &quot;good&quot; scientist-apes reject these notions as fantasy and bunk, of course. By the end of the movie, the &quot;religious&quot; apes find what they belived in to be false, and renounce their beliefs.This was absolutely not mentioned in the movie or the book, and came off extremely heavy-handed.3) The female partner for Mark Wahlburg was a total bore. A cardboard box would have sufficed in her place.4) Also a heavy-handed anti-gun statement was made mid-way through.5) The ending still leaves me wondering what Burton was somking at the time of filming it.

Astronaut Leo Davidson is thrust through time to find himself trapped on a world ruled by apes. After a planned escape, Davidson becomes the unexpected hero in a human revolt against the apes! The only real hero in PLANET OF THE APES is seven-time Oscar winner Rick Baker for his phenomenal make-up designs, which bring the apes to life in a wide array of different shapes and sizes. The apes simply look incredible, but unfortunately, the appliances hinder the performances of the actors, and often cause them to stumble through their lines. This is not the case for Helena Bonham Carter, who prefers to whisper incoherently, or Tim Roth, who just spits his vile contempt for humanity like venom. Where screenwriter William Broyles Jr. makes his biggest mistake is in allowing all humans to have the capacity of speech, which completely destroys the impact of Davidson's arrival on the planet. There can be no questioning of ape ethics or breakdown in ape philosophy if the lead character is no different than the humans that already exist on the planet.

Frankly I was curious how she would end up in a monkey suit. It's quite amusing, she is an attractive ape and she looks like she had hair electrolysis is the areas where it mattered, for apes, I guess. She is also sulky and pampered. I never thought I could distinguish a British ape from an American ape.The only similarity between this movie and the original planet of the apes is the title. Charlton Heston's cameo appearance on this film does not make it any more related to the original...so okay this is not the original movie. Both movies are preposterous, but why did we like the original and to this day watch their reruns on cable television - because the original had a plot! This movie, while loaded with special effects is disjointed with so many side-stories and sub-plots. It's protracted and watching this movie is tantamount to having the flu and you could not get rid of the symptoms fast enough. While the screenwriters were on to it, they added the proverbial equivalent of PETA in this case of course it has been reversed  to AETP (Apes for the Ethical Treatment of People).As for technicality, this DVD is excellent. It is clear and crisp, too bad there are better movies that do not have this advantage. I suppose if you like Mark Wahlberg or if you like animal genres (bees, ant, anacondas, spiders, etc...) you can keep this DVD to complete your collection. The DVD set also includes the making of the movie. Interestingly the actors had to learn how to walk like apes! Why! Did we not learn from grade school that in the theory of evolution, the apes began to master the world when they learned to walk upright? Mark Wahlberg not only plays a lost pilot in this movie, he looks desperately lost and wants to get out. Perhaps he was thinking that with this movie he may end up like that other actor who played Luke Skywalker, what was his name?",2,Rent this movie if you must - buy something else,1027123200,"07 20, 2002",2002,2016,"['am', 'glad', 'DVD', 'set', 'was', 'present', 'not', 'cheap', 'either', 'horrendous', 'movie', 'friend', 'who', 'gave', 'knew', 'like', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Frankly', 'was', 'curious', 'how', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'monkey', 'suit', 'quite', 'amusing', 'attractive', 'ape', 'had', 'hair', 'electrolysis', 'areas', 'where', 'mattered', 'apes', 'guess', 'also', 'sulky', 'pampered', 'never', 'thought', 'could', 'distinguish', 'British', 'ape', 'American', 'ape.The', 'only', 'similarity', 'movie', 'original', 'planet', 'apes', 'title', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'more', 'related', 'original', 'so', 'not', 'original', 'movie', 'movies', 'are', 'preposterous', 'why', 'did', 'original', 'day', 'watch', 'reruns', 'cable', 'television', 'original', 'had', 'plot', 'movie', 'loaded', 'special', 'effects', 'disjointed', 'so', 'many', 'side-stories', 'sub-plots', 'protracted', 'watching', 'movie', 'tantamount', 'having', 'flu', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'rid', 'symptoms', 'fast', 'enough', 'screenwriters', 'were', 'added', 'proverbial', 'equivalent', 'PETA', 'case', 'course', 'been', 'reversed', 'AETP', 'Apes', 'Ethical', 'Treatment', 'People', '.As', 'technicality', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'clear', 'crisp', 'too', 'bad', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'advantage', 'suppose', 'like', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'like', 'animal', 'genres', 'bees', 'ant', 'anacondas', 'spiders', 'etc', 'can', 'keep', 'DVD', 'complete', 'collection', 'DVD', 'set', 'also', 'making', 'movie', 'Interestingly', 'actors', 'had', 'learn', 'how', 'walk', 'apes', 'Why', 'Did', 'not', 'learn', 'grade', 'school', 'theory', 'evolution', 'apes', 'began', 'master', 'world', 'when', 'learned', 'walk', 'upright', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'not', 'only', 'lost', 'pilot', 'movie', 'desperately', 'lost', 'get', 'out', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'thinking', 'movie', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'other', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'what', 'was', 'name']",N/A
540847,A3VP5SXUTKJFRW,B00003CXXU,"C. DeGhoul ""urieldewolf""","[2, 3]","When I first watched this movie I was a little turned off and disconcerted because I was thinking of the original Planet. That was my mistake. This version of Planet of the Apes must be viewed not as a comparison to the original but as its own movie. This movie deliberately does NOT copy the original. Yes, of course, there are similar elements but that's as far as it goes. Burton was not trying to improve the classic. He wasn't trying to make any deep political statements. This is simply a movie and you can best enjoy this one by keeping your mind open, keeping the original out of your head, and watching it twice.Many reviewers may not know that this movie was an emergency fill-in. I have it from an excellent source that the intended movie deal fell through and the studio needed to plug SOMETHING into its schedule. Considering the limitations of time and budget, I think they did a pretty amazing job pulling together what they could on such short notice. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have its problems. It does. Several of them. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it for what it is -- simply a movie made to entertain you for a couple of hours. Period.Once you get over the initial confusion of trying to compare it to the first and being disconcerted by the behavior of the apes that was entirely unlike the original, it's worth viewing a second time because preconceptions will be wiped away by then. These apes have retained many ape-like qualities (and that's logical given the basis of this story) and it's absolutely amazing to watch the actors breath life into the characters who are humanoid but definitely not human. Rick Baker's makeup is nothing short of incredible when you realize that they did not use cables, animatronics, or CGI. They could have &quot;cheated&quot; but they didn't (maybe budgetary and/or time constraints prevented this or maybe it was a conscious choice). They let the actor's BE the characters and some of them achieved incredible performances.This Planet had quirks of humor. It's fluff with no underlying political or social statement. It's meant to be viewed and enjoyed simply as entertainment. It does have several shortcomings (overblown stunts, logic errors, inconsistencies in the physical strength of the apes)but that shouldn't stop an open mind from enjoying what IS there. I completely disagree with Burton's ending and his justification for it but I do have to admit that it was the one part of the movie that had me thinking -- trying to figure out what the heck he meant by it.  lolIf nothing else, if you're a fan of f/x makeup you will find things to marvel over in this movie. I found the extras on the second DVD to be worth the money alone because I am a fan of f/x makeup so I was riveted to the segment about the makeup and the simian academy sequence was also fascinating. In fact, I'd actually suggest watching the extras BEFORE watching the movie (if you haven't seen it before)to help clear out any preconceptions you may have about this one trying to copy or compete with the original. That wasn't the case. It was economics. The studio had to fill a slot after another movie fell through so a group of people were thrown together to whip out something to fill in the blank in the schedule. Unfortunately, the cast and crew suffered for the choice because the original is impossible to top. Burton didn't even try, knew he couldn't, so he took an alternative route. All fluff, no real substance, but don't let that distract you from some shining performances and fantastic makeup.So, if you're a die-hard original Planet of the Apes fan and feel there's absolutely no room for error, avoid getting your fur rubbed the wrong way and don't see this one. If you have an open mind, enjoy f/x makeup, and can keep in mind that this is not and was never intended to be a copy of the original, then you may enjoy this movie though you probably won't be overwhelmed by it.",3,Avoid preconceptions,1007251200,"12 2, 2001",2001,3955,"['When', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', 'little', 'turned', 'off', 'disconcerted', 'was', 'thinking', 'original', 'Planet', 'was', 'mistake', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'must', 'be', 'viewed', 'not', 'comparison', 'original', 'own', 'movie', 'movie', 'deliberately', 'NOT', 'copy', 'original', 'Yes', 'course', 'are', 'similar', 'elements', 'as', 'far', 'Burton', 'was', 'not', 'trying', 'improve', 'classic', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'make', 'deep', 'political', 'statements', 'simply', 'movie', 'can', 'best', 'enjoy', 'one', 'keeping', 'mind', 'open', 'keeping', 'original', 'head', 'watching', 'twice.Many', 'reviewers', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'movie', 'was', 'emergency', 'fill-in', 'have', 'excellent', 'source', 'intended', 'movie', 'deal', 'fell', 'studio', 'needed', 'plug', 'SOMETHING', 'schedule', 'Considering', 'limitations', 'time', 'budget', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'amazing', 'job', 'pulling', 'together', 'what', 'could', 'such', 'short', 'notice', 'not', 'say', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'Several', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'what', 'simply', 'movie', 'made', 'entertain', 'couple', 'hours', 'Period.Once', 'get', 'initial', 'confusion', 'trying', 'compare', 'first', 'being', 'disconcerted', 'behavior', 'apes', 'was', 'entirely', 'original', 'worth', 'viewing', 'second', 'time', 'preconceptions', 'will', 'be', 'wiped', 'away', 'then', 'apes', 'have', 'retained', 'many', 'ape-like', 'qualities', 'logical', 'given', 'basis', 'story', 'absolutely', 'amazing', 'watch', 'actors', 'breath', 'life', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'humanoid', 'definitely', 'not', 'human', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'makeup', 'nothing', 'short', 'incredible', 'when', 'realize', 'did', 'not', 'use', 'cables', 'animatronics', 'CGI', 'could', 'have', 'quot', 'cheated', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'maybe', 'budgetary', 'and/or', 'time', 'constraints', 'prevented', 'maybe', 'was', 'conscious', 'choice', 'let', 'actor', 'BE', 'characters', 'achieved', 'incredible', 'performances.This', 'Planet', 'had', 'quirks', 'humor', 'fluff', 'underlying', 'political', 'social', 'statement', 'meant', 'be', 'viewed', 'enjoyed', 'simply', 'entertainment', 'have', 'several', 'shortcomings', 'overblown', 'stunts', 'logic', 'errors', 'inconsistencies', 'physical', 'strength', 'apes', 'should', ""n't"", 'stop', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoying', 'what', 'IS', 'there', 'completely', 'disagree', 'Burton', 'ending', 'justification', 'do', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'one', 'part', 'movie', 'had', 'thinking', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'heck', 'meant', 'lolIf', 'nothing', 'else', ""'re"", 'fan', 'f/x', 'makeup', 'will', 'find', 'things', 'marvel', 'over', 'movie', 'found', 'extras', 'second', 'DVD', 'be', 'money', 'alone', 'am', 'fan', 'f/x', 'makeup', 'was', 'riveted', 'segment', 'makeup', 'simian', 'academy', 'sequence', 'was', 'also', 'fascinating', 'fact', ""'d"", 'actually', 'suggest', 'watching', 'extras', 'watching', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'before', 'help', 'clear', 'out', 'preconceptions', 'may', 'have', 'one', 'trying', 'copy', 'compete', 'original', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'was', 'economics', 'studio', 'had', 'fill', 'slot', 'movie', 'fell', 'group', 'people', 'were', 'thrown', 'together', 'whip', 'out', 'something', 'fill', 'blank', 'schedule', 'Unfortunately', 'cast', 'crew', 'suffered', 'choice', 'original', 'impossible', 'top', 'Burton', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'try', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'took', 'alternative', 'route', 'fluff', 'real', 'substance', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'distract', 'shining', 'performances', 'fantastic', 'makeup.So', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'fan', 'feel', 'absolutely', 'room', 'error', 'getting', 'fur', 'rubbed', 'wrong', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'enjoy', 'f/x', 'makeup', 'can', 'keep', 'mind', 'not', 'was', 'never', 'intended', 'be', 'copy', 'original', 'then', 'may', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'overwhelmed']",N/A

As Roger Ebert said, the original film will still be the movie everyone thinks of when they think ""Planet of the Apes."" Where the original was big on ideas and lowly on production value, this Tim Burton remake is beautiful to behold, with apes so real you'd swear you were in a zoo, but the ideas behind the plot... well... let's just say they start small and grow on you.Much of the original's rich detail in the Ape society is missing in the remake, replaced with Burton's typical hamish humor about mankind's ego trips over animals and our fellow man. Gone is the segregation in Ape Society, the discovery of humans as thinking animals, and much of the other intellectual meat in the original. The only plot thread worthy of a sci-fi fan's attention is the naive ""human rights"" beliefs of the ape Ari, who begins with over-idolized ideals of a spoiled, sheltered ""girl"" who must change her pacifist beliefs as the humans make a brutal and violent stand to win their freedom from the apes. The surprise ending ties in nicely with the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston earlier in the film, but it lacks the depth or impact of the first film's ending. Also, another great moment, the 2nd coming of Semos (you'll know it when you see it) is drastically undercut by the villian, General Thade, who is as shallow and cliched as I've ever seen. Tim Roth's performance as General Thade is the film's best, dispite being the most poorly written and cliched. It seems that Hollywood cannot portray a military tyrant with any subtlty at all. ""Give me absolute power,"" pleads Thade, and the poor Ape who does just can't understand why Thade goes bad... So, in the end we have a movie with only a glimmer of the original's depth, but a lot of ""money on the screen"" as they say.The make-up for this film is truely something that must be seen to be believed, and Burton has tasked his actors with a host of little touches that enforce the illusion, like the beating of chests and sounds and howlings which work their way into normal Ape English. Apes sometimes leap from place to place, which is way overdone, as these apes fly around like the Monkeys in the Wizard of Oz. Next to the apes and the fine performances of those, the human beings in this movie are one-dimensional and boring, further reducing the impact of this film. Mark Wahlberg is only the best of the worst, dry and uncaring, certainly no Charlton Heston. Nothing from the ""hairless"" apes inspires the audience to root for them...THE DVD - is 5 out of 5 stars, 2 DVDs actually, with 1 DVD devoted entirely to extras. Most anyone will be wondering ""how did they do that?"" after seeing this movie, and luckly there is enough information about the special effects and make-uo to peak anyones interest. The transfer is good, with nice color and an average sound track.

540856,A26T16EHVHIJ8O,B00003CXXU,"Christopher Griffen ""Commitment to mediocrity!""","[1, 1]","I had convinced myself that Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes was a pretty good movie after viewing it last summer in the theaters. However, upon watching the DVD, I have to say that I wanted to like it so much that I must have clouded my vision a bit.The effects and make-up artistry are far superior to those of the original film, but none of the shock value, suspense or even character development from the original film are here. Maybe it's not fair to compare Burton's POTS with the original Charlton Heston-helmed film. The original, as dated as it is today, still holds up very well. Burton's version, however, doesn't try hard enough to duplicate the elements that made the original film successful and then when he DOES try to emulate the original film (as he does in the film's final scene), he fails completely.The DVD has several bonus features that might justify the price of admission if you like film documentaries. A lot of stuff on how the effects were done and the ability to go through the whole movie, simultaneously showing you how the various effects were done. Unfortunately, my copy had a glitch where it showed you some of these &quot;mini-documentaries&quot; even if you DON'T have the DVD set to show them. (I returned my copy.)The film is not entirely without charm. Helena Bonham Carter's Ari is an intriguing character who puts a new spin on animal rights. Tim Roth absolutely seethes evil as Thade, the ape general. He overacts to the 9th degree, but it works for this role. The appearance and power of the apes is much more appropriately shown in this film than in the original, but that's probably just a reflection of how far movie technology has come. Even with all the fantastic effects, however, Burton's POTS doesn't hold a candle to the original.",2,Watch the original instead,1010102400,"01 4, 2002",2002,1783,"['had', 'convinced', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'viewing', 'last', 'summer', 'theaters', 'However', 'watching', 'DVD', 'have', 'say', 'wanted', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'must', 'have', 'clouded', 'vision', 'bit.The', 'effects', 'make-up', 'artistry', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'original', 'film', 'none', 'shock', 'value', 'suspense', 'even', 'character', 'development', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'here', 'Maybe', 'not', 'fair', 'compare', 'Burton', 'POTS', 'original', 'Charlton', 'Heston-helmed', 'film', 'original', 'as', 'dated', 'today', 'still', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'Burton', 'version', 'however', ""n't"", 'try', 'hard', 'enough', 'duplicate', 'elements', 'made', 'original', 'film', 'successful', 'then', 'when', 'try', 'emulate', 'original', 'film', 'film', 'final', 'scene', 'completely.The', 'DVD', 'several', 'bonus', 'features', 'might', 'justify', 'price', 'admission', 'like', 'film', 'documentaries', 'lot', 'stuff', 'how', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'ability', 'go', 'whole', 'movie', 'simultaneously', 'showing', 'how', 'various', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'Unfortunately', 'copy', 'had', 'glitch', 'where', 'showed', 'quot', 'mini-documentaries', 'quot', 'even', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'have', 'DVD', 'set', 'show', 'returned', 'copy', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'charm', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Ari', 'intriguing', 'character', 'who', 'new', 'spin', 'animal', 'rights', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'absolutely', 'evil', 'Thade', 'ape', 'general', '9th', 'degree', 'role', 'appearance', 'power', 'apes', 'much', 'more', 'appropriately', 'shown', 'film', 'original', 'probably', 'just', 'reflection', 'how', 'far', 'movie', 'technology', 'come', 'Even', 'fantastic', 'effects', 'however', 'Burton', 'POTS', ""n't"", 'hold', 'candle', 'original']",N/A

Instead I felt like the film was merely serviceable as it had all the makings of what could've been a great film yet something or everything just completely fell apart. And also, unlike obvious ones like Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and maybe Big Fish, this is probably the first time you couldn't tell Tim Burton made it. It could've been made by a James Cameron wannabe and you couldn't tell the difference.On the orbiting space station Oberon, they discover an electromagnetic storm. They decide to send an ape in a spaceship(despite the fact it's an electromagnetic storm which could very well mess with the electronics) and sure enough he's in trouble so Leo Davidson has to rescue him but in doing so he's caught in a time wave and is sent into the distant future, crash landing on a planet. On this planet, turns out that walking talking apes rule with oppressed humans being locked up and branded.Not giving up, he leads a group of humans and a senator's daughter Ari and her bodyguard away from the ape society with hopes of getting home. But Thade, a nasty unforgiving ape wants to exterminate all humans and he's got a particularly big vendetta against Leo.Is it as bad as everyone makes it out to be? It's hard to say. The makeup is excellent, miles beyond the original. It's got a proven director at the helm, Danny Elfman supplying the score, and the cast is nice enough. However, the cast is one of its problems. To me Mark Wahlberg is in what I call the Bruce Willis group, meaning that no matter how angry or sad they get, their voice and mannerisms get in the way, making them sound bored and bland. What was surprising was Helena Bonham Carter who finally looks desirable, unlike in Fight Club. And personally, I can't stand Michael Clarke Duncan. He reminds me of one of those guys who gets one A on a test and all of a sudden thinks he's valedictorian material.No review of the Planet of the Apes remake...sorry, ""re-imagining"" without mention of the ending.

I spent about 15 minutes with a &quot;huh?&quot; expression on my face.  Then it hit when I applied some Star Trek theology to the film.  Basically this movie is not about Apes it is about the effects of time travel on past, present, and future.  What would happen if we took a P4 Laptop back in time to WWII?  Could the war department make use of it?  Ok now give that technology to the Germans.  What you would get would be an altered present reality dealing not in Apes or men but, Nazi regime.It is here that you must understand this movie makes several assumptions to understand the ending.  One General Thade is still alive when Whalburg leaves his planet.  Remember the pod at the bottom of the water?  General Thade must have found a way to resurrect the pod, power it and enter into the time portal and venture back in time to prehuman dominace and liberate or educate his prehistoric ancestors.  When Whalburg arrives in his present day he finds an altered Earth based on what Thade did in the past.  Remember time is linear and if you jump back you affect the future.  How's that for a lesson in Time Management. LOL.The movie has some of the best costume and makeup I have ever seen.

Some of the line could have been dropped, (&quot;Get your filthy hands off of me, you damned dirty human!&quot; and Heston as an ape yelling &quot;Damn them!  Damn them all to hell&quot;, for example,) but the movie works far better than I thought it would, far better.  The end is not what I thought it would be, but then again neither was the first one.

Tim Burton' imagination comes through in his remake of a classic.  It's a shame that it would be so difficult to get him to try and do another one for this continuing story.  He always does his best at trying to make everything seem so realistic, and has such a quirky and twisted imagination when trying to reinvent something.  I must admit, when I heard the Mark Wahlberg was going to be in it I cringed.  But despite what things I hadn't liked about much of his previous career, he has really come a long way and starts to really make something of himself as an actor.  Not his best work, but a heck of a lot better then what it had been.  The ending I must admit probably could have been handled a tiny bit better, and will leave most people scratching their head.  Which brings us back to ""What is Tim Burton thinking about what's to happen next?"", and yet probably won't ever find out as it isn't likely to get him to do another.

But Tim Burton is a solid director, and the whole thing came together pretty well, even if he couldn't say &quot;no&quot; to some of his usual corniness.There was plenty of action. But what really made Planet of the Apes worth seeing was (as I'm sure you guessed), the setting, costumes and special effects- Tim's trademark, and some of his best. My only gripe about the apes would be the jumping... a tad too much. It almost looked like &quot;Monkey Matrix&quot;.As far as acting goes, the general opinion has been that the apes were better than the humans. I thought they were all merely decent, with the exception of Tim Roth who was excellent as usual, and Mark Wahlberg who looked perfect for his part... but shouldn't be allowed to talk. They really could have cast a more believable lead than Mark.Speaking of leads, it was nice to see Charlton Heston make an appearance, but they should have left out his &quot;Damn them all to hell&quot; line. I hate when cameos go silly like that. Also silly, was the &quot;surprise&quot; ending. I'm not going to give it away, but you'll see it coming for miles. Pretty dumb, but I guess it gives them their sequel.All in all, this movie makes a decent legacy for the 1968 original. I'd say I liked them both about the same.

Fincke ""thegreatfandincke""","[10, 12]","Since the film LOOKS so good, not just in ads but on the screen, and thanks, not just to Tim Burton, but to the King Kong of ape makeup himself, Rick Baker, it should not be allowed to go to waste.  All we need is some one to write a new script who has  an ability to develop characters, to dramatize ideas rather than belaboringly state them, and some one who knows why Jar-Jar Binks is such a bad idea that insults the audience's intelligence and bores it.  In other words, if they'd only hired a writer and fired the executives in charge of making &quot;blockbuster&quot; movies with insulting B-movie scripts, we might have had something here.But instead what we have is hackneyed and tedious to listen to.  Helena Bonham Carter is the only thing I liked watching and that was just because her beautiful eyes still communicate even through all the makeup.  It was fun to WATCH the apes walk around and it was a stroke of insightful genius to see them express emotions like apes.  It was delightful and thought-provoking to watch the enlightened, sophisticated, educated Helena Bonham-Carter ape break into terrified monkey yelps as she rode Marky Mark's back across the river in which she was afraid of drowning.  This, the sniffing each other, the jumping around---all the behaving like real apes was great.  It was like being able to see human emotion and its expressions from an exterior point of view.  We would look funny when we laugh or shout or sweat or fidget, etc.  if we could only see ourselves externally with the physicality and audibility of ourselves not understood from within, loaded up with cognitive content, but rather seen from without as the expressive quirks of animals.Unfortunately they changed not only the ape way of behaving but they also changed the humans a little from the previous planet of apes movies.  They made the humans capable of speech and then proceeded to give them nothing whatsoever worthwile to say.  EVER.  Instead we get a STUPID and UNREALISTIC boy who tries to take on an entire army of charging apes by himself with complete disregard for the larger plan that Marky Mark is trying to get to work, ALL so that we can see that Marky Mark, in trying to save him, has learned to think of others before himself like Helena Bonham-Carter does.  AWWWWW.  Isn't that sweet?  And utterly lame?Or there is Amazon Woman, pure human physical beauty who pines after our hero while he falls in love with an ape woman.  How ever will this love triangle be resolved?  Well, Marky Mark can always add to the male harem fantasy by getting to kiss the adoring women of two different species before flying away in his spaceship!  My, oh my, have we evolved!Prepackaged drivel loaded with cliche &quot;morals&quot; pasted into the script at random points by a team of trained monkeys apparently.  What is this movie about?  Animal rights?  Race relations?  The welfare state?  Man's inhumanity to man?  The O-Zone layer?  Making lots of money off an assumed-to-be-unthinking public?  AHH, I think it's the last one.Last but not least the laughable, extremely boring and unimaginative plot ends with an ending which I almost thought made the whole preceding borefest worthwile.  I got a kick out of our surprise ending, although in subsequent weeks I can't seem to find any one who can exactly decipher what it was supposed to mean.  But there's the surefire way to make your ending unpredictable, have it make no sense.  That way no one can anticipate it by using their good sense.The worst part of it all is Tim Burton's affiliation with this project.  You would think that a man so bitter about studio control over Batman, a man capable of such works of beauty as Edward Scissorhands and the Nightmare Before Christmas, a man capable of fighting against formulas as he did with Beetlejuice, a man so willing to follow his artistic and thematic guts in Ed Wood and Mars Attacks!-- even at the price of financial humiliation, would not be capable, this far into his career, of becoming a puppet of a money-grubbing studio.  Maybe the commercial failures of Ed Wood and Mars Attacks have ruined his ability to assert himself creatively.  Or maybe, this was a chance to earn another IOU in credibility from the studios that he might go and make another Edward Scissorhands, like he did after Batman opened up his chance to do whatever he wanted.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Paying dues to Hollywood before making real films again.

540869,A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2,B00003CXXU,"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru""","[0, 0]","The first challenge when watching this movie is to try to forget the 1968 classic.  This movie exists entirely as its own singular entity, with more action, a stronger emphasis on the civil rights and animal rights debate and almost completely eliminating the evolution theory debate that formed the backbone of the original.There is more action in this movie, too, with some genuinely spectacular visual effects extremely worthy of an Academy Award.But enough of this.  I would not have bothered with watching this movie had it been directed by anyone other than Tim Burton.  He is one of those directors who has a distinct personality, like Terry Gilliam, early Steven Spielberg or Alfred Hitchcock, there are certain trademark moves or images that he uses that distinguishes each movie as a Tim Burton film.  (He would have been the ideal choice to direct The Grinch, as his imagery often has strong parallels to the illustrations in Dr. Seuss)Those images are muted in this movie.  Probably by necessity as the setting is more alien than anything Tim Burton has presented us with before.  His strength was in showing movies where the real world was twisted into a surreal extreme (the pastel colors of suburbia in Edward Scissorhands; the towering cathedrals of Gotham in Batman &amp; Batman Returns).We still get off-beat scenes such as an ape wearing a toupee &amp; dentures mixed in with the action &amp; adventure, but as it stands, the scene that stands out as feeling the most like a vintage Tim Burton moment is the controversial twist ending.  It does play with the final revelation of the conclusion of the original Planet of the Apes movie.  But of course the last shot of that movie was a final commentary on nuclear war, while the ending of this Apes picture is simply there to play with our minds.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  While the original Apes will always be regarded as a classic piece of filmmaking in its own right, this Apes movie will be regarded as an entertaining addition to Tim Burton's body of work as a filmmaker, something of a change of pace from his regular productions.",4,Tim Burton's most mainstream film,1006473600,"11 23, 2001",2001,2118,"['first', 'challenge', 'when', 'watching', 'movie', 'try', 'forget', '1968', 'classic', 'movie', 'entirely', 'own', 'singular', 'entity', 'more', 'action', 'stronger', 'emphasis', 'civil', 'rights', 'animal', 'rights', 'debate', 'almost', 'completely', 'eliminating', 'evolution', 'theory', 'debate', 'formed', 'backbone', 'original.There', 'more', 'action', 'movie', 'too', 'genuinely', 'spectacular', 'visual', 'effects', 'extremely', 'worthy', 'Academy', 'Award.But', 'enough', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'bothered', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'been', 'directed', 'anyone', 'other', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'one', 'directors', 'who', 'distinct', 'personality', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'early', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'are', 'certain', 'trademark', 'moves', 'images', 'distinguishes', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ideal', 'choice', 'direct', 'Grinch', 'imagery', 'often', 'strong', 'parallels', 'illustrations', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'images', 'are', 'muted', 'movie', 'Probably', 'necessity', 'setting', 'more', 'alien', 'anything', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'presented', 'before', 'strength', 'was', 'showing', 'movies', 'where', 'real', 'world', 'was', 'twisted', 'surreal', 'extreme', 'pastel', 'colors', 'suburbia', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'towering', 'cathedrals', 'Gotham', 'Batman', 'amp', 'Batman', 'Returns', '.We', 'still', 'get', 'off-beat', 'scenes', 'such', 'ape', 'wearing', 'toupee', 'amp', 'mixed', 'action', 'amp', 'adventure', 'scene', 'out', 'feeling', 'most', 'vintage', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'moment', 'controversial', 'twist', 'ending', 'play', 'final', 'revelation', 'conclusion', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'movie', 'course', 'last', 'shot', 'movie', 'was', 'final', 'commentary', 'nuclear', 'war', 'ending', 'Apes', 'picture', 'simply', 'there', 'play', 'minds', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'thing', 'original', 'Apes', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'regarded', 'classic', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'own', 'right', 'Apes', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'regarded', 'entertaining', 'addition', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'body', 'work', 'filmmaker', 'something', 'change', 'pace', 'regular', 'productions']",N/A
540870,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00003CXXU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[0, 1]","This modern remaking of Planet of the Apes is ultimately a victim of its own hype.  It is by no means a bad movie, but it is also not the blockbuster thrill ride of an adventure it was forecast to be.  Then the whole brouhaha about Charlton Heston's cameo appearance and the lines he delivered gave the movie an undeserved stigma of mockery.  The whole gun control mythology built up around Heston's dialogue is as inane and improper a talking point as I have ever seen.  As for the movie, it does offer a lot of good, sometimes impressive action complemented by better than average special effects.  The apes, with a couple of exceptions, are also remarkably realistic.  The real weakness of the movie is the plot.  It seems simple enough.  Mark Wahlberg, in an adequate performance, plays Captain Leo Davidson, who decides to go after the lost space-going chimp he has trained to explore an astronomical anomaly.  He gets sucked in to the cosmic anomaly and thrown out several thousand years in the future on a planet run by intelligent apes (not monkeys, it is important to note, especially if you are in the company of apes).  Here humans are enslaved under a brutal system rife with abuse and mockery.  Not all apes support the policy of militant slavery as best represented by the cold and ruthless General Thade (Tim Roth).  Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a senator's daughter, believes that apes and man can coexist, and she ends up helping Davidson and his gang of escaped slaves to safely flee the city.  Unfortunately, what Davidson leads the humans toward is the ultimate showdown between apes and men on the planet.  A little monkey ex machina is thrown in toward the end, and this plot point works fairly well.  Not content to stop here, though, the filmmakers throw in a final twist that I applauded the first time I watched the film but regard with some ambivalence now.Unfortunately, Planet of the Apes gets too cute for its own good.  Ari, a central player in events, does not carry the force she should, in my opinion, because the same makeup artists who did an outstanding job on General Thade and others tried to make her look too human; at any rate, she doesn't exactly scream ""ape"" at me.  Then there are all of the little in-jokes and attempts at witticism.  I'm all in favor of including the obligatory ""get your hands off me, you damn dirty human"" line, and I would have even welcomed the classic ""a planet where apes evolved from men"" quip (which was not used here, for good reason as things turn out).  However, the babbling slave trading baboon-type character with his constant complaints and ill-fated use of the ""can't we all just get along"" line annoyed me to no end.  Adequate characterization is lacking in several places in this movie.  I'm not sure why the human Daena (played by the exceedingly human female Estella Warren) was even included here; her obvious feelings for Davidson remain unexplored, as Davidson seems to have eyes only for the much less enticing ape woman who helped him escape.  I also cringe whenever I see Kris Kristofferson in a movie, but I guess that's just my own problem.While the movie does seem to pull punches with the storyline, it is quite generous in terms of the extras to be found on the DVD.  I have not watched any of these special features because I'm not impressed enough by the movie to really care about them, but the fact that the bonus DVD does offer commentary, five extended scenes, a music video, six documentaries on the making of the film, and some other goodies should not go unnoticed by anyone thinking about buying Planet of the Apes.

Actually, he seemed to be pretty populare with both species on that footing. Hmmmmmm. Must have been that manly physique of his.I've watched the first planet of the apes when I was younger, and I must say at least this updated version is alot cooler and interesting to watch for two hours. And its rather funny to see Charlton Heston's roles switched from the human hero to the dying father of General Thade, although his dialouge still ran in the same rut of the first one, giving us a pretty clear idea how his relations with human's lay.There's even a few scenes with Paul Giamatti (Sideways,Big Mamma's house,)as the slave trader. And if you've ever seen big fat liar, one can clearly see he went for the blue body garb with orange hair once again.A good action flick with plenty of CGI environments to spice up the apes world.

540872,A1QKKCVQC4BZT,B00003CXXU,Danilo Pochini,"[0, 2]","I'm really staggered to see how this movie has gotten so trashed by everyone. Just because the story is different than the original? Just 'cause Mark Wahlberg wanted to return home and nothing else? Because the ending was different? Because Estella Warren wasn't a &quot;fully developed&quot; character? Well, damn you all! Aren't you able to simply sit back and enjoy a movie anymore? You americans obviously wanted a remake along the lines of Psycho, like a shot-by-shot reconstruction. But those kinds of films completely lack dignity and almost can't be called movies. More like imitations of movies. All this film has in common with its original is that there is a planet ruled by apes. It is not set on this planet, but in another time and another place. Mark Wahlberg replaces the legendary C. Heston as the lead, and some have said that the former just doesn't measure up to the latter. But come on, people, Wahlberg is playing a completely different character! Heston was 43 when he filmed the original, and Wahlberg was 29 when he filmed this! The former's character was cynical and gruffy, the latter's is young, confused, and inexperienced. He may not be as intriguing a character as Heston's, but it's still a well-written role in its own right. The script is also generally well-written, although it admittedly has some trouble in the scenes when Wahlberg first crashes on the planet. They are a bit confusing and messy. But from there it's all uphill. We meet a variety of imaginative and engrossing characters like human slave trader Limbo, human rights activist Ari, general Thade, colonel Attar, and two pleasantly funny and goofy old ape senators in a really funny dinner scene. Halfway through the film's plot starts unfolding and Heston has a really enjoyable little scene where he explains almost every loose thread of the story. Th battle scene between the humans and the apes is a little too low-key, but it doesn't hurt the movie at all. All in all, this is a quality effort that, for my money, really lives up to all the hype. Well done once again, Tim!

540873,A27CFNHYZG6WS8,B00003CXXU,darragh o'donoghue,"[2, 3]","'Planet of the Apes' is a very clever film, easily superceding the 'original', throwing ideas and allusions all over the place without ever really following them up.  It plays with the old 'stick a bunch of apes in a room and they'll eventually come up with Shakespeare' chestnut, by alluding to 'Pericles', 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', 'Hamlet' etc.  'Apes' is not a futuristic warning, but a documentary about the way we live now, prey to our violent instincts, desperate for charismatic, fascistic leaders: degenerate, uncultured, unthinking beasts.Like 'Mars Attacks', 'Apes' is an attack on American philistinism; like the aliens, the apes in the first section mercilessly mock the pretensions of humans, with their faith in science and technology.  Neither race, human or ape, would come come up with Shakespeare today if you locked them in a room with the complete works of Shakespeare to copy.This sense of degeneracy structures another mythic narrative, that of Christ - after the appearance of Charlton Heston, the film goes all Ben-Hur and Cecil B. Demille.  Wahlburg is the man who arrives from the stars to deliver the human faithful from an ape empire deliberately modelled on the Romans.  This millenial theme also figures in the allusions to another space/monkey classic, Kubrick's '2001: a Space odyssey'.  Overall, the film is closer to the science fiction of HG Wells, with its anxieties about race and what it means to be human, than the late 60s that produced the original.Visually, the film is frequently miraculous, with some lovely conceits, my favourites being the shuttling pod looking like an anguished tear-drop, the ape scarecrows that litter the desert to ward off humans (an eerily Gothic image) and the ruins of the spaceship.  There are some truly haunting sequences, such as the 'Blair Witch'-like footage of the lost crew.  The portentous epic form (especially 'Gladiator') is frequently invoked only to be bathetically undermined (although Burton is sometimes too convincing in replicating their dinosaur dullness).The actual experience of watching the movie, though is dispiriting.  The idea of inversing his usual narrative of outsider vs. settled community, with the WASP as outsider and the freaks as the hierarchical society, could have been interesting if the hero wasn't so stolid.  Roth as a Mockney Darth Vader is annoying.  The narrative is non-existent, simply capture, escape, revolt (I'm Spartacus!), and Burton's usual gallery of amiable and awful eccentrics is replaced by vacuous supermodels and the spirits of Jar-Jar Binks.",2,A typically intelligent Tim Burton film.,999648000,"09 5, 2001",2001,2577,"[""'Planet"", 'Apes', 'very', 'clever', 'film', 'easily', 'superceding', ""'original"", 'throwing', 'ideas', 'allusions', 'place', 'ever', 'really', 'following', 'up', 'old', ""'stick"", 'bunch', 'apes', 'room', ""'ll"", 'eventually', 'come', 'up', 'Shakespeare', 'chestnut', 'alluding', ""'Pericles"", 'Midsummer', 'Night', 'Dream', ""'Hamlet"", 'etc', ""'Apes"", 'not', 'futuristic', 'warning', 'documentary', 'way', 'live', 'now', 'prey', 'violent', 'instincts', 'desperate', 'charismatic', 'fascistic', 'leaders', 'degenerate', 'uncultured', 'unthinking', 'beasts.Like', 'Attacks', ""'Apes"", 'attack', 'American', 'philistinism', 'aliens', 'apes', 'first', 'section', 'mercilessly', 'pretensions', 'humans', 'faith', 'science', 'technology', 'race', 'human', 'ape', 'would', 'come', 'come', 'up', 'Shakespeare', 'today', 'locked', 'room', 'complete', 'works', 'Shakespeare', 'copy.This', 'sense', 'degeneracy', 'mythic', 'narrative', 'Christ', 'appearance', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'film', 'Ben-Hur', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'Demille', 'Wahlburg', 'man', 'who', 'stars', 'deliver', 'human', 'faithful', 'ape', 'empire', 'deliberately', 'modelled', 'Romans', 'millenial', 'theme', 'also', 'allusions', 'space/monkey', 'classic', 'Kubrick', ""'2001"", 'Space', 'odyssey', 'Overall', 'film', 'closer', 'science', 'fiction', 'HG', 'Wells', 'anxieties', 'race', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'late', '60s', 'produced', 'original.Visually', 'film', 'frequently', 'miraculous', 'lovely', 'conceits', 'favourites', 'being', 'shuttling', 'pod', 'looking', 'anguished', 'tear-drop', 'ape', 'litter', 'desert', 'ward', 'off', 'humans', 'eerily', 'Gothic', 'image', 'ruins', 'spaceship', 'are', 'truly', 'haunting', 'sequences', 'such', ""'Blair"", ""Witch'-like"", 'footage', 'lost', 'crew', 'portentous', 'epic', 'form', 'especially', ""'Gladiator"", 'frequently', 'invoked', 'only', 'be', 'bathetically', 'undermined', 'Burton', 'sometimes', 'too', 'convincing', 'replicating', 'dinosaur', 'dullness', 'actual', 'experience', 'watching', 'movie', 'though', 'dispiriting', 'idea', 'inversing', 'usual', 'narrative', 'outsider', 'vs.', 'settled', 'community', 'WASP', 'outsider', 'freaks', 'hierarchical', 'society', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'hero', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'stolid', 'Roth', 'Mockney', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'annoying', 'narrative', 'non-existent', 'simply', 'capture', 'escape', 'revolt', ""'m"", 'Spartacus', 'Burton', 'usual', 'gallery', 'amiable', 'awful', 'eccentrics', 'replaced', 'vacuous', 'supermodels', 'spirits', 'Jar-Jar', 'Binks']",N/A
540874,A10U5D2T50JREX,B00003CXXU,Darrell Heath,"[57, 71]","I believe the original 1968 version of ""The Planet of the Apes"" was the first time I realized that a film might actually be something more than an escapist entertainment.  In fact, it might have something important and relevant to say to its audience.  Indeed, that first film seemed to have something to say on a wide variety of topics: race relations, bigotry, vivisection, free thinking within an oppressive society as well as humanity's place in the universe.  It made these points by using ironic twists, gentle humor and downright scathing satire; all wrapped within the context of an exciting sci-fi adventure story.  The result was a classic piece of film making.  An almost instant icon of 20th century pop culture that eventually spawned four sequels and even a short lived TV series.So, when I heard that 20th Century Fox wanted to do a ""re-imagining"" of POTA my first thought was ""Why?"".  Hadn't the first film gotten everything right the first time around?  Why monkey (no pun intended) with something that was pretty much perfect already?  Then I heard that Tim Burton had been assingned to direct and I thought that here was an ideal choice  if you were going to re-imagine something as iconic as POTA.  After all, he had done a marvelous job of revamping the image of Batman from that of the ridiculously campy to that of the more respectible avenging Dark Knight (only to have Joel Schumaker undermine all of that with ""Batman and Robin"").  While a re-imaging of POTA wasn't needed, I thought, it still might be interesting to see the results of such an undertaking from the capable hands of a director like Burton.  Unfortunately the final product failed to meet my expectations.The biggest dissapointment here is the script, no real plot and flat, one dimensional characters ... The social commentary, so important to the original, is almost completely lacking here.  Early on in the story there are some token nods to racism and human vs animal rights but then the writers never develop them.  ...  The characters, especially the human ones, are hardly worth caring about.  Leo, the lost astronaut (Mark Wahlberg),  seems to just wander around through the film in a catatonic trance; never even aware of the romantic interest of the human female (Estella Warren) or that of the chimp female Ari (Helena Bonham Carter).  The film makes it obvious the two are interested in Leo but, again, fail to develop it into anything.  This movie wants to get up and go but is eventually left spinning its wheels aimlessly for two hours.However, its not all bad.  There are some things that make this film worth viewing.  One, is Burton's visuals.  Burton is first and foremost a visual director.  In other words, the look of the film seems to take precedence over everything else.  Unfortunately that's the case here.  The script [is poor] but the film itself looks gorgeous.  I particularly loved the shots of Ape City built into the huge and forbidding rocky crag, also the views of the long marching columns of the ape army at night.  Also, the forest that surrounds the city is one of those typically beautiful but scary Burtonesque fairy tale type affairs.  My favorite aspect to this film is Rick Baker's incredible ape make-up.  These are simply incredible designs that obviously had a lot of work put into them.  If Baker doesn't win an Oscar for his efforts there is simply no justice in the world.  Another good thing going for this film is the quality of the performances which for the most part are quite good.  In particular Tim Roth as the violently tempered chimp General Thade and Helena Bonham Carter as the female chimp Ari who sympathizes with the plight of the humans.  There is also good comic relief in the form of the Orangutan vender of humans played by Paul Giamatti. And Michael Duncan Clarke is an imposing Colonel Attar.  I also have to make mention of Charlton Heston's brief cameo as Thade's dying father.  In one of the films few good ironic moments Heston's character introduces the concept of guns into the story.  Thade's Daddy has been hiding the fact that humans at one time had such dangerous weapons (apparently apes have never developed firearms) and reveals the secret to his son before he kicks the bucket.  Finally, mention must be made of Danny Elfman's wonderful score; a nice blending of Jerry Goldsmith's atonal, primitive sounds that worked so well for the original film with that of a full orchestra.  I may or may not get the DVD but I will certainly add the soundtrack to my collection.Ultimately I found this ""re-imagining"" of POTA a disappointment.  There are occaisional moments where this film shows that it has the potential to achieve so much but then turns around and squanders it.  When will Hollywood learn that cool visuals and great looking make-up are not enough to make an excellent or even a good movie?",3,A Missed Opportunity,1002153600,"10 4, 2001",2001,4875,"['believe',

The authenticity of the makeup is simply unbelievable.I also thought that Mark Wahlberg would be too young for Heston's role, but the changes to the story mask that quite a bit.  And Wahlberg--sorry, but I can't get past the image of him in Boogie Nights--plays his role with a certain emotional detachment.  Tim Roth is convincing, if a bit over the top, playing the human-hating General Thade.Nice cameos went to David Warner (a sci-fi regular) and Chuck Heston.  As to the latter, it's ironic that his character espoused something of an anti-gun ideology considering the actor was once the president of the NRA.  For the record, he plays Thade's dying father.The story is similar in some major respects and dissimilar in others.  Basically, astronaut time travels, crash lands on a planet dominated by apes, tries to get the heck out of there.  Those are the similarities.  The dissimilarities included talking humans and no societal organization structure for the apes based upon breed.  Those two things aren't necessarily bad, but considering that the humans dressed like savages, I thought the humans should sound a little more 'primitive.'Burton's climactic scene has the movie making a revelation that Burton hoped would top original's (Heston finding the Statue of Liberty buried hip deep, decaying but still standing).  Suffice to say, it didn't even come close.  Then, again, perhaps it's unfair to try to hold Burton to that standard.

540879,A247CZXJ1XWB3Q,B00003CXXU,David Jimerson,"[0, 0]","In 1983 there premiered a wonderful TV miniseries allegory about the rise of fascism and monsters in human skin . . . a miniseries so good that I highly recommend it be viewed by anyone with a love for liberty.That miniseries was &quot;V,&quot; a none-too-subtle parable that always leaves me with chills, because they got it right.This new rendering of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is a clumsy attempt at the same thing, though in this case it fails miserably because the underpinnings upon which it's based don't hold up.Don't get me wrong -- I thought it was a visual marvel and a landmark achievement in filmmaking.  It's only when Burton &amp; Co felt they had to say something of importance that I wrinkled my lower lip in disgust.Indeed, much of the movie plays as a cheap and insulting shot at Republicans.  The nastiest of the apes even quotes Barry Goldwater, replacing &quot;liberty&quot; with &quot;apes,&quot; turning a noble idea -- that a jealous vigilance against enemies of the freedoms we hold dear can never be wrong -- into something sinister, probably racist, homophobic, and downright slave-traderish.In this light, the catch ending, the final scene, makes sense, but only in this light.  If you try to figure out how the narrative gets from A to B in that final shot, you'll fail, because there's no logical connection.  But viewed as political commentary, I get it -- and I think it's cheap.The original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; was chock-full of political allusion and sentiment, but it, unlike this new version, worked (largely because the follies of human nature in general, not a particular shcool of political thought, are lampooned).  In fact, a major plot change between the two movies, that this Planet of the Apes is not Earth, weakens any commentary value the Burton version otherwise might have had.  Even if you want to go along with its anti-Republican stance, you're still hung out to dry by the fact that it's something happening way out there, and not here.So, in the final analysis, it's a movie worth seeing -- there is more than a little humor, and references to the original series of movies range from nearly imperceptible to downright heavy-handed -- but I could have done without the obvious one-sided political bashing.",4,"Visually Stunning, Yet Downright Irritating in Parts",996364800,"07 29, 2001",2001,2275,"['1983', 'premiered', 'wonderful', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'allegory', 'rise', 'fascism', 'monsters', 'human', 'skin', 'miniseries', 'so', 'good', 'highly', 'recommend', 'be', 'viewed', 'anyone', 'love', 'liberty.That', 'miniseries', 'was', 'quot', 'V', 'quot', 'none-too-subtle', 'parable', 'always', 'chills', 'got', 'right.This', 'new', 'rendering', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'same', 'thing', 'though', 'case', 'miserably', 'underpinnings', 'based', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'thought', 'was', 'visual', 'marvel', 'landmark', 'achievement', 'filmmaking', 'only', 'when', 'Burton', 'amp', 'Co', 'felt', 'had', 'say', 'something', 'importance', 'wrinkled', 'lower', 'lip', 'disgust.Indeed', 'much', 'movie', 'cheap', 'insulting', 'shot', 'Republicans', 'nastiest', 'apes', 'even', 'Barry', 'Goldwater', 'replacing', 'quot', 'quot', 'quot', 'apes', 'quot', 'turning', 'noble', 'idea', 'jealous', 'vigilance', 'enemies', 'freedoms', 'hold', 'dear', 'can', 'never', 'be', 'wrong', 'something', 'sinister', 'probably', 'racist', 'homophobic', 'downright', 'slave-traderish.In', 'light', 'catch', 'ending', 'final', 'scene', 'sense', 'only', 'light', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'narrative', 'A', 'B', 'final', 'shot', ""'ll"", 'fail', 'logical', 'connection', 'viewed', 'political', 'commentary', 'get', 'think', 'cheap.The', 'original', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'was', 'chock-full', 'political', 'allusion', 'sentiment', 'new', 'version', 'worked', 'largely', 'follies', 'human', 'nature', 'general', 'not', 'particular', 'shcool', 'political', 'thought', 'are', 'lampooned', 'fact', 'major', 'plot', 'change', 'two', 'movies', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'not', 'Earth', 'commentary', 'value', 'Burton', 'version', 'otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'Even', 'want', 'go', 'along', 'anti-Republican', 'stance', ""'re"", 'still', 'hung', 'out', 'dry', 'fact', 'something', 'happening', 'way', 'there', 'not', 'here.So', 'final', 'analysis', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'more', 'little', 'humor', 'references', 'original', 'series', 'movies', 'range', 'nearly', 'imperceptible', 'downright', 'heavy-handed', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'obvious', 'one-sided', 'political', 'bashing']",N/A
540880,A39L5T2ZQZ52FN,B00003CXXU,David Michael Cohen,"[6, 6]","The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was a movie that enthralled the senses and stimulated the mind.  On the surface a contemporary re-make must have seemed like a great idea.  However, if you strip away the admittedly excellent make-up, the incredibly un-subtle in-jokes and the brief appearances of Hollywood has-beens Kris Kristofferson and Charlton Heston you find the movie has no real substance at all.  Enthralling and stimulating it ain't.A large part of the problem rests with the hero, Hollywood never-will-be Mark Wahlberg.  Heston's character ""Taylor"" in the original movie was as real as a movie figure can get; determined but cynical, not without feeling but not prone to ridiculous heroics either.  The audience could feel for him because he was so, for lack of a better word, human.  Wahlberg's character, by contrast, never developes beyond the superficial, so we never care if he gets home or not.Even if we did care, however, the poor construction of the movie's plot raises too many questions.  In the original there was a genuine sense that the ape's society was alien, but similar to our own, with caste distinctions and inter-cultural strife.  In the 2001 version, there are no such distinctions, we are supposed to simply ignore the differences between the breeds of apes.  Furthermore they use eupemisms popular in our society, so even the most thick-headed viewer can slap his forehead and say, ""Oh I get it, the apes are a metaphor for us.""  A tip; metaphors generally have more impact when they are subtle.One element that keeps appearing over and over is the fact that the apes can leap huge distances from a stand-still.  Can anyone explain the physics of 400 lbs of heavy muscle leaping 20 feet in the air with ease?  Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but if you want your material to be taken seriously you can't abandon all sense of reality.  Perhaps they were hoping latecomers would think they walked into a showing of ""The Matrix.""Then there is the question of how the apes dominate the humans.  The humans can talk, they all seem well fed and clean and they are fairly numerous.  Yes the apes treat them like beasts, but there is nothing about them to suggest that they actually are beastlike.  Why don't they apply some ingenuity and fight back?At times the movie seems on the verge of showing some class, like when the villian, general Thade, shows his deep reverence for his dying father.  No sooner do we see this, however, when we are shown the incredibly disturbing clips of Helena Bonham Cater's ape-character making goo-goo eyes at our human hero.  Then there is the hokey, duex ex machina ending, which is too trite to even discuss.George Lucas had ""Howard the Duck.""  Steven Spielberg had ""Batteries Not Included.""

Eastwood,"[33, 42]","I have enjoyed several of Tim Burton's previous films (especially his SLEEPY HOLLOW &quot;detective&quot; movie), and I have been a fan of the original PLANET OF THE APES film since it was first released. This &quot;remake&quot; (which does not follow either the original didactic book or the original movie) seems to have been made solely in order to display Burton's gimmicky idea of transposing the positions of apes and human beings at the end when the hero (Mark Wahlberg) returns to his own time. This seems to have been done merely to surprise and shock the hero (and the viewer), but it makes absolutely no sense, either logically or in terms of the story arc (such as it is), for the apes who are now controlling Wahlberg's earth are far more technologically and politically advanced than the apes who live in the future which he'd just left.The film has very few interesting moments, a noteworthy exception being when an elderly chimp played by NRA gun lobbyist Charlton Heston (who also played &quot;Taylor&quot; in the original film) expresses terror of guns.Finally, if you listen to Burton's commentary on the DVD, you may be dismayed by the difficulties he has when speaking his mind: &quot;Just wanted a sort of a clean technology--something not too far in the future--something--uh--very clean, very--uh--but--uh. Circular was always important because I--. That was something I always felt was sort of important to the overall Planet-of-the-Apes mythology.

Rick Baker does it again!However...It's plainly obvious that Tim Burton clearly has a massive ego. It's also obvious that the studio is very stupid to believe that his whimsical vision can turn anything into box office gold. And it's more than obvious that there's ONLY ONE &quot;Planet Of The Apes&quot;, directed by FRANKLIN J. SCHAFFNER, written by PIERRE BOULLE (and ROD SERLING) and starring CHARLTON HESTON, RODDY MCDOWALL, KIM HUNTER, etc.This one?

Neither do the actors. Helena Bonham Carter gives it a nice try, but it makes you crave for some sort of Merchant-Ivory substance (as opposed to her combining McDowall &amp; Hunter all into one...talk about ambitious). Mark Wahlberg is a big non-existence. Tim Roth overacts. Estella Warren pouts and pouts and pouts. And, on the up side, there are some nice moments with Michael Duncan Clarke &amp; David Warner, a terrific Paul Giamatti and, of course, Heston (in a much talked-about cameo).Overall, the story is a contradictive muddle, never really making up its mind whether it wants to be science fiction or parody. And, if your knowledge is top-dog on the five &quot;Apes&quot; movies (from 1968 to 1974), I'm pretty sure you'll know which scenes he tried to &quot;reimagine&quot; to make this peacemeal claptrap.Yeah, it's entertaining, but pretty unmemorable by the time it's over.Stick with the originals.

540885,A1AEDW75371P5M,B00003CXXU,Dellin Canfield (dellincanfield@hotmail.com),"[0, 1]","Tim Burton has proved again and again that he is a marvelous craftsman.  His movies always have this tremendously artistic appearance.  They are a spectacular vision of the imagination and they are seamlessly fused together with a distinctive appearance that is instantly recognizable.  But one has to seriously wonder why he doesn't bother to attach his unmatched creative abilities to the work of a competent writer.  In &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; there is this extremely frustrating conflict between great potential and consistantly missed opportunities.  On the surface, everything is truly beautiful.  It is easy to just sit back and be dazzled by the perfectly crafted visuals.  When Mark Wahlberg is introduced to the mysterious planet he crashes on, his experience is mirrored by excessively dark compositions that heighten the anxiety and sense of forboding that is the halmark of the &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; franchise.  However, Burton's addition is to add flashes of light that expose pieces of brilliant color against the darkness, both on the Apes grotesque body armor and within the faces of the terrified humans.  In years past, a scene like this would have been little more than a muddled cloud, in Burton's hands, the sequence is an artistic composition, and it is far more effective for this meticulous handling.  However, even though Burton's efforts make the film look great, you can tell he simply has no concern for any other component of his art form.  The actors are visibly left to interpret scenes on their own and some of the choices they make in delivering their lines are clearly inapropriate.  Fortunately, Marky Mark isn't given all that much to do, and he is pretty adequate (think the bewildered Keanu Reeves in The Matrix--an expression he has down pat) but the extremely talented Helena Bonham Carter is allowed a little too much self-indulgence.  On the other hand, Tim Roth is absolutely perfect and he steals every scene much like he single-handedly took over &quot;Rob Roy&quot; several years ago.  His costume is also the most genuine as well as his half-monkey half-human swaggering gate.  The main problem with the movie is that it is way to content to make &quot;cutesy&quot; references to the prior movies and doesn't bother to make any kind of social comment whatsoever.  When Charlton Heston shows up disguised appropriately as an ape and gives a refrain of his famous speech from the original but this time directed at the humans, people chuckle to show their own cleverness in picking up on irony rather than because they actually felt any amusement at the scene.  What is most infuriating is that you have all these wonderful potential metaphors walking around.  The movie could have so easily turned into a comment against racism, slavery, sexism, a philosophical examination of humanity, or even a futeristic version of &quot;Braveheart&quot; with Wahlberg in the Willam Wallace role.  Instead, it is more like &quot;Rambo III&quot; without three fourths of the action, I don't even know what all the dialogue was meant to accomplish except to display the fact that the monkeys can move their mouths really well (far better than the old movie anyway).  But still, even without any real plot or purpose of any kind, this movie is pretty cool to look at, and if you really buy a ticket for a summer blockbuster like this with the intention of seeing something highly intellectual, then you're the ape.",3,"Great Visuals, Lame Script.",996796800,"08 3, 2001",2001,3462,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'proved', 'again', 'again', 'marvelous', 'craftsman', 'movies', 'always', 'have', 'tremendously', 'artistic', 'appearance', 'are', 'spectacular', 'vision', 'imagination', 'are', 'seamlessly', 'fused', 'together', 'distinctive', 'appearance', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'one', 'seriously', 'wonder', 'why', ""n't"", 'bother', 'attach', 'unmatched', 'creative', 'abilities', 'work', 'competent', 'writer', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'extremely', 'frustrating', 'conflict', 'great', 'potential', 'consistantly', 'missed', 'opportunities', 'surface', 'everything', 'truly', 'beautiful', 'easy', 'just', 'sit', 'back', 'be', 'dazzled', 'perfectly', 'crafted', 'visuals', 'When', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'introduced', 'mysterious', 'planet', 'experience', 'mirrored', 'excessively', 'dark', 'compositions', 'heighten', 'anxiety', 'sense', 'forboding', 'halmark', 'quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', 'franchise', 'However', 'Burton', 'addition', 'add', 'flashes', 'light', 'expose', 'pieces', 'brilliant', 'color', 'darkness', 'Apes', 'grotesque', 'body', 'armor', 'terrified', 'humans', 'years', 'past', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'muddled', 'cloud', 'Burton', 'hands', 'sequence', 'artistic', 'composition', 'far', 'more', 'effective', 'meticulous', 'handling', 'However', 'even', 'Burton', 'efforts', 'make', 'film', 'look', 'great', 'can', 'tell', 'simply', 'concern', 'other', 'component', 'art', 'form', 'actors', 'are', 'visibly', 'left', 'interpret', 'scenes', 'own', 'choices', 'make', 'delivering', 'lines', 'are', 'clearly', 'inapropriate', 'Fortunately', 'Marky', 'Mark', ""n't"", 'given', 'that', 'much', 'do', 'pretty', 'adequate', 'think', 'bewildered', 'Keanu', 'Reeves', 'Matrix', 'expression', 'down', 'pat', 'extremely', 'talented', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'allowed', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'self-indulgence', 'other', 'hand', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'scene', 'much', 'single-handedly', 'took', 'over', 'quot', 'Rob', 'Roy', 'quot', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'costume', 'also', 'most', 'genuine', 'as', 'well', 'half-monkey', 'half-human', 'swaggering', 'gate', 'main', 'problem', 'movie', 'way', 'content', 'make', 'quot', 'cutesy', 'quot', 'references', 'prior', 'movies', ""n't"", 'bother', 'make', 'kind', 'social', 'comment', 'whatsoever', 'When', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'up', 'disguised', 'appropriately', 'ape', 'refrain', 'famous', 'speech', 'original', 'time', 'directed', 'humans', 'people', 'chuckle', 'show', 'own', 'cleverness', 'picking', 'up', 'irony', 'rather', 'actually', 'felt', 'amusement', 'scene', 'What', 'most', 'infuriating', 'have', 'wonderful', 'potential', 'metaphors', 'walking', 'around', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'so', 'easily', 'turned', 'comment', 'racism', 'slavery', 'sexism', 'philosophical', 'examination', 'humanity', 'even', 'futeristic', 'version', 'quot', 'Braveheart', 'quot', 'Wahlberg', 'Willam', 'Wallace', 'role', 'Instead', 'more', 'quot', 'Rambo', 'III', 'quot', 'three', 'fourths', 'action', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'dialogue', 'was', 'meant', 'accomplish', 'display', 'fact', 'monkeys', 'can', 'move', 'mouths', 'really', 'well', 'far', 'better', 'old', 'movie', 'anyway', 'still', 'even', 'real', 'plot', 'purpose', 'kind', 'movie', 'pretty', 'cool', 'look', 'really', 'buy', 'ticket', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'intention', 'seeing', 'something', 'highly', 'intellectual', 'then', ""'re"", 'ape']",N/A

540889,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B00003CXXU,D. Litton,"[4, 5]","Remember at the end of the 1968 version of &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; when Charlton Heston falls to his knees and curses the human race in front of the ruins of the Statue of Liberty? That moment is one of the most well-remembered moments in cinema, a true movie revelation that brings to light everything the movie was trying to say in one swift, gut-punching moment. That movie had a lesson to teach, not just about where we were headed as humans, but about the way in which we treat other people.What Tim Burton's latest film, a &quot;reimagining&quot; of that masterpiece, does is take the basic ideas and turn them into a foray for some of the most elaborate set pieces and special effects, devoid of a script that is involving enough to keep audiences entertained. It's a small-minded popcorn movie that brings on all the rousing action that a colony of apes can muster, while keeping us waiting for a newly-spun ending that is shocking for all the wrong reasons.The setup for the movie is full of holes. A spacecraft is searching for an electrical storm in space for some apparent reason, with lots of monkeys in tow to send out in situations where a human mission would prove fatal. When one monkey is lost in the storm, the film's hero, Major Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), goes after him, only to be transported many years into the future, to a planet where apes rules human life.The film never really answers the question of whether or not the planet he has landed on is Earth in the distant future. What it does portray is a complete role reversal of man and animal, as monkeys parade around in human clothing, capturing humans and using them for servants or trade. They are regarded as filthy and worthless, and General Thade (Tim Roth), a ruthless and unrelenting force, would like nothing more than to wipe out the rest of them, despite the protestations of the senator's daughter, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter).And so, our hero for the day, Major Davidson, leads the enslaved humans to freedom, to the place known as the beginning of ape civilization, where all the clues begin to come to light, and a battle will be fought that will show the true rulers of the planet.The film has a tremendous combination of good and bad points, the good resting with the production design and character development, the bad resting with the lack of human (or ape) intrigue behind the overall plot. Burton's sense of visual style is ever present, and since &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; he has grown as a director but not as a storyteller.Let's face it: we've never seen a planet of the future look so authentic, so captivating. Burton sells us on the setting, giving it a look of desolation with small spots of civilization gone awry. The villages of the primates are clustered together, surrounded by dry, arid lands, while the place at which the final third of the film takes place is completely desolate and provoking.The characters are also very intriguing, and under some good casting calls, they come to life brilliantly. Mark Wahlberg proves he can be a hero as Davidson, who is firm in his belief that there is a way to win control. Helena Bonham Carter convinces us of Ari's compassion and caring nature for the brutality visited upon the humans, while Tim Roth is equally passionate about the extermination of the human race as General Thade.But, after all is said and done and thrown and shot about, the film is surprisingly lacking in any emotional connection to what has happened. There are never any moments of sheer suspense or utter shock, mainly due to the movie's predictability. We know from the beginning that the electrical storm is going to play some part later on in the movie; it is also easy to see where the apes originated from, if you think about it. And the ending is a downer, unable to live up to the surprise at the end of the original.&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; brings to mind an old saying: &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; Tim Burton's attempts to pull a new twist on the story is high on style and visual flare, but the emotional depth is as barren as the wastelands of the ape planet.

540891,A2VJ80PM1G00QV,B00003CXXU,drkhimxz,"[0, 0]","Is there anything left to say about Planet of the Apes. I think not. The story is a good one, apes dominant in a society in which humans are enslaved or outlaws at the mercy of the Master Apes. Ignoring all the social philosophizing, the story still holds up, as a novel twist on Tarzan of the Apes (and, I suppose, numbers of literary predecessors of one type or another). The soundtrack is stirring (not aesthetically but in serving the purposes of a screen score), the actors voices under their costumes, vocally fitting to the roles, the helpful girl ape is particularly good among the female players, the males are suitably gorilla macho, the human hero is OK, but not in the top drawer for movie heroes, the human cast is also Ok, with a few doing somewhat better with their very limited roles,  and, the visual effects are excellent.The picture is well worth a look.

540893,A3GI22GLBVBGC2,B00003CXXU,Dusty,"[3, 3]","I was horrified when I first learned that Hollywood was attempting to cash in by remaking yet another film classic that had been done perfectly the first time. Was it only to make more money, and to sneak their own imprint on to the original filmmakers' success?Ironically, this is typical of the kind of human behavior that the original Planet Of The Apes railed against. Yet, if you watch the documentary Behind The Planet Of The Apes, you'll marvel at just how oblivious some Hollywood executives were to the philosophical messages in the original film. One of them claimed that the filmmakers might have quietly slipped a few messages into the film, but overall it was intended as nothing more than a simple action/adventure. This goes a long way to explain why Hollywood fails so often, despite so much money and so much talent at its disposal.And as if to drive home the point that thinkers are the powerless minority in Hollywood, director Tim Burton's commentary for this ""re-imaging"" of the original seems to show that Burton was only marginally more aware that ""hidden"" messages existed in the original film--messages that cried out like a banshee to anyone who actually bothered to THINK about that film. Even worse, I like Tim Burton's work, but the commentary reveals that Burton, though possessing a degree of thoughtfulness, may not be as articulate as one would hope. And this may best explain why this remake of Planet Of The Apes can best be described as an entertaining misfire.I borrowed this film from the library, so I wouldn't lend any financial support to Hollywood's remake-for-profit schemes. I also watched it with my thumb resting on the remote-control's stop button. My goal was to see what this remake was all about, without allowing it to ruin the original's real impact on me.So no one was more surprised than me, when I had no trouble seeing Burton's Planet Of The Apes through to the end. As a matter of fact, I quite enjoyed this film. The reason is because the story is entirely different than the original, so there's little risk of Burton stepping on the original's toes. Even better, this film did not succumb to Hollywood's obscene tendency to tack a happy ending onto every story about rape, murder, holocaust, or homo sapiens being overthrown by ""lesser"" species. In that regard, it seems more like a continuation of the original series, rather than a remake of the original.Even so, apart from the ending, this your typical Hollywood action film--the kind of film that Richard Zanuck apparently originally envisioned back the late 1960's. There's a studly leading man with mediocre acting skills (no offense--I like Mark Wahlberg), a deliciously beautiful woman (actually two of them, if you find apes attractive), an easily recognizable evil villain who is blindly followed by hoards of unrecognizable and expendable henchmen, and a story line that relies heavily on deus ex machina to tie the screenplay's many loose ends together. This is the kind of film that Arnold Schwartzenneger would feel perfectly at home in. And there's nothing wrong with that, since it doesn't water down the power and force of the original film's message. Indeed, to Burton's credit, this remake does make a few humble attempts to insert social and political commentary.However, in terms of filmmaking, I do not believe that this was Tim Burton's finest hour. For example, in the original film, the important ""hunt"" scene takes place in an expansive locale, with lots of motion and wide shots. You feel that a lot of effort was put into that scene, and this makes thoughtful people wonder why the filmmakers placed so much emphasis on the hunt.However, the ""hunt"" scene in Burton's remake takes place in a clausterphobic jungle, and the only thoughtful question that results is, ""why did a film with this kind of budget do an entire hunt scene on a sound stage the size of my living room?"".Films with real messages usually employ devices like foreshadowing, which often make the second viewing even more satisfying than the first. But here, again, Burton and Zanuck show no interest in making the audience THINK. For example, there were abundant opportunities to foreshadow Simos' future significance in the opening scenes that are surrounded by chimps in cages, yet no attempt was even made. Not even a nameplate for Simos on one of the cages--even though the screenplay called out for ""METALLIC SQUARES stamped with SERIAL NUMBER and NICKNAME"". The only real foreshadowing was Alexander's insistence that Pericles had been taught to return to the mother ship, which later helps to explain the silliness of his ""miraculous"" return at just the right moment.Likewise, the brief montage of Earth transmissions contained only typical, iconic scenes from history--the kind of montage that a hungover high-school film student might throw together a few minutes before their 15-second film project is due: Hitler speaking, Iwo-jima flag raising, Castro speaking, a frame from The Day The Earth Stood Still, and Bill Clinton confessing that he stained Monica Lewinsky's dress. (The screenplay called for different, but equally irrelevant clips). There were no clips of Koko the gorilla using sign language. No clips of Jane Goodall living among the chimpanzees of Western Africa. No clips of pack animals serving humans. No clips of the Ku Klux Klan or George W. Bush behaving like animals that settle disagreements with violence. There were also no clips of any events that would have occurred between today and the future time in which the film is set. So many opportunities lost here!I was also dumbfounded by the lack of sheer horror on Mark Wahlberg's face in the final scene--as well as director Tim Burton's apparent lack of direction that Wahlberg should exhibit horror in a horrifying situation. I think Burton has been working with puppets too long to adequately direct live actors anymore.Where the film really shines is--as expected--with special effects. The opening shot of the cross-shaped Oberon nestled below Saturn's rings was awe-inspiring. And of course the ape makeup itself was inspired--Helena Bohnam Carter never looked so good. Burton also did a great job of capturing the way that apes move and behave, in obvious contrast to the original film's insistence that apes move and behave much like humans. The human actors playing apes hung, swung, and used their toes, much like real simeans would. Unfortunately, they also jumped and threw aggressors into the air with an unrealistic amount of power. I also wasn't entirely satisfied with the ape voices, which too often sounded like a cross between James Earl Jones and Barry White. It was also annoying to see a 100% survival rate every time one of those egg-shaped space pods crashed into a planet. I've suffered more damage with fender-benders in parking lots.Overall, this is an entertaining film, spoiled mainly by the unavoidable comparison to the original, and Tim Burton's lack of attention to detail. As an action/adventure that is meant to make obtuse Hollywood executives even richer, this film succeeds. As a thoughtful statement on the human condition, it mostly fails. Somewhere in between lies a film that is more or less worth watching--as long as you don't expect too much from it.",3,An entertaining misfire (potential SPOILER alert),1243123200,"05 24,

Kim,"[1, 4]","Two days ago, I said in my ""Lost in Space"" DVD review that I was never a fan of the original TV show, so I didn't really anticipate much when watching the '98 film adaptation. After that, I couldn't really be a fan of the film, either, because of how tedious and silly it was. Well, the reaction to Planet of the Apes is almost identical to the one for Lost in Space. I'm not a fan of the original POTA film (or any of its sequels for that matter) so I saw the 2001 Tim Burton remake with very modest expectations. In the end, I was pretty disappointed. Sure, the film looks good, the music by Danny Elfman is nice, and the apes actually look realistic enough to be believable. But is this supposed to be an action-adventure or a comedy? Because the ape mannerisms (most of ) feel very out-of-place, and the comic relief named Limbo didn't seem appropriate whenever he was onscreen (Paul Giamatti gave a decent performance, though). Then, there's the dialogue, which is unbelievably corny, even cornier than in the original '68 film. It almost sounded like I was watching a sci-fi soap opera. Also, the ending. Yes, everyone, including me, is still confused about the ambiguous ending. I know that it's up to us to analyze it. In fact, I think I understand, to some extent, how and why it happens. But come on, the ending seems like a cop-out, and it would have been better if it was explained in a very proper manner. And finally, Tim Burton directed this? Normally, I admire his works, but this looks like this could be his weakest film yet. And it doesn't even look like it was created by him: it's such a drastic departure from his usual arty style that it looks like he didn't even care about this project.I can't really say that I like this remake. I'm not really grading this as a Burton film; I'm grading it as a Sci-Fi adventure film, and it doesn't really amount to much. There are some good things about it (the music, the look of the apes, and the look of the film), but everything else is just...poor.

For years there was a rumor making the rounds that Oliver Stone was to re-make Planet of the Apes. In the end, it officially became Tim Burton- all the better, one might think, for here was a man famed for his willingness to be odd, dark and creative while at the same time staying just commercial enough. But this film will be forever known as Burton's Folly and it justifiably belongs in the same embarrassing scrap heap of turkeys that were so-called Hollywood blockbusters just because there was a lot of money, promotion and toys behind them like Godzilla, Independence Day, Pearl Harbor, the newer Star Wars movies, and all the rest.Warning signs started popping up when it became know that Burton would be calling it a ""re-imagining"" not a re-make...And that a romantic kiss between Bonham-Carter's chimp and Wahlberg's chump was given the kabosh by the higher-ups....Burton was obviously at the mercy of the cigar-chompers, who would not let this thing get too out-there for its own good- there was too much green at stake. Ironically, in the end, it did no good anyway. You can't shine a ....well you know the rest. A sow's ear is still just that. All the special effects and bombastic music in the world can't hide a miserable script lacking pathos, weight and character development.Where to begin? Well how about Marky Mark Wahlberg as the main character. Stiff, one-dimensional, and downright boring, Wahlberg is about as miscast as it can get. I have seen mediocre movies that actually are improved upon by the right actor in the right role. Take Julianne Moore in The Forgotten as a classic example. A faulty film, but a great acting performance. Here we simply have a person out of their depth, sleepwalking through their role. And by ""depth"" I mean being in a lead role in a Hollywood film. We are talking about a guy who got his start as Donny ""NKOTB"" Wahlberg's wannabe little brother. And NKOTB was the greatest promotional smoke-and-mirrors coup of them all. And now he is going to lead a blockbuster? Look, the man can't act. Give me Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, even Dennis Quaid would have been better.Next, take the just as one dimensional evil chimp leader Thade as played by Tim Roth. Just irritating. His ""I am evil and grumpy so I stare endlessly upward""-schtick tires fast. How about Helena Bonham Carter's ridiculous eye makeup and mumbling fake-American accent? Or the obvious ""we are in a huge studio""-feeling of the ape village? Or the absurd ""thousands of years have passed but the ship still has power""? Or the fact that the humans can talk? Apes afraid of water that surrounds their country for miles? And of course, the characters are all pure cardboard cut-outs, the best being the completely useless blond Estella Warren, whose fine curls and make-up remain spotless through chases, battles, hunts, you name it.And the ending...Well, now I know what a final insult really is. And, without revealing anything, it was an obvious lame attempt to leave things open for a sequel...And guess what, there has not been any! Miracles do happen, even in the fantasy, money-acursed Babylon known as Hollywood, where Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, and all the reality show ""stars"" are famous because the mainstream press, and the dollars that drive them, says so.There is one scene worth mentioning that is mildly interesting. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dieing father, who knows the truth of the apes' past history.

Can we just have them take back the movie, instead?I had high hopes for this little number, until the reviews started coming out. [Sigh] I really enjoy Tim Roth a lot, and have since I first saw him in ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover."" He's a phenomenally talented actor, and was pretty much the only bright spot in the film, despite playing a dark and relatively evil character. Mark Wahlberg, a surprisingly gifted actor, was fairly mediocre. Estella Warren...Her function in ""Planet of the Apes,"" though, is unclear to me. Helena Bonham Carter...seems to play more of a love interest than Estella does, and she wasn't integral to any scene except the one in which they spring her family. So she's a passing love interest who stares broodishly at Mark all through the film, and plants herself on his lips kind of randomly before he leaves...At any rate, it's another pretty Summer '01 movie that lacks substance. The make-up was fantastic, and Tim Roth played a pretty convincing evil chimpanzee. His bizarre altered voice stopped being overly-distracting after about a half hour or so, and he must have been a good study when going to ape school. Most of his co-workers, however, seemed to have a hard time moving like a monkey - especially the gorillas, all of which kind of shuffled stiffly along, moving with nothing resembling the natural grace of the animal. The costumes were a bit lame, but the sets and natural locations were rather beautiful. The red glowing tents of the ape armies were particularly striking.There are a few ""surprise twists"" at the end which are neither surprises nor legitimate twists. It's as if, midway through filming, Tim Burton turned to his screenwriters and said, ""So! How's it end?"" and they got sort of pale and quiet, and realized, as they looked at each other all panic-stricken, that they had in fact forgotten something as they suspected. So, they tried to think of a mind-blow similar to what the original film had, and they failed. The first ""twist"" was forgiveable, and not even wholly objectionable. The second was a bit less forgiveable, and fairly objectionable. The third and final twist was just outright ridiculous, made not a damn bit of sense whatsoever, and just ticked me off. It wasn't even a mind-blow, it was the last desperate act of a writer grasping at straws. This movie blew.

I have a lot of different theories on the ending of this movie and I have read a lot of comments on ""IMDb.com"" about the puzzling and bewildering ending to this movie.  I don't think Tim Burton even wanted us to know the ending really. It SHOULD HAVE been explained better in the movie. The audience deserved to have an ending with a great twist (just like the original classic 1968 movie did). I own the DVD of this remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" - (I bought it used at a really cheap price) - Anyway, I listened to Tim Burton's explanation of the ending (commentary on the DVD) and it didn't make sense and still didn't explain the ending. So, my thinking is that the ending was really up to YOU, (the viewer). Obviously, since the ending was never explained, you have to come up with your own theory of what happened. So, it made you think and discuss the ending and some people (like me and others on this site and the IMDb site) were irritated with the ending.

540910,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,B00003CXXU,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 7]","This film is another of director Tim Burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his ""vision"" to the screen.  He has done it with ""Batman"", ""Sleepy Hollow"" and now this.  This is not a remake.  The only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and Charleton Heston makes a cameo).  Burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.The original Planet of the Apes was a product of its time.  During the 1960's America was struggling to redefine its civilization.  It was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms.  It was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal.  In that context, POTA was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day.  POTA was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of American society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior.  The dialectic between Colonel Taylor (Charleton Heston), Dr. Cornelius (Roddy McDowall) and Dr. Zira (Kim Hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.Burton's version is as much a product of today's times as POTA was of the sixties.  This is Apes for Dummies.  It is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance.  The ""surprise"" ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel.  While the ending of the original POTA gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, Burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, ""I know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.""From a technical perspective, as is always the case with Burton's film, the film is excellent.  The makeup is fantastic and Burton's camerawork is outstanding (though I continue to dislike his dark look).  However, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.The story has been reduced to a monster movie.  The humans band together behind Captain Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) to fight the monstrous Apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably Helena Bonham Carter as Ari).  The presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.The acting is mixed.  Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role.  Walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong.  This part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in Wahlberg's repertoire.  Helena Bonham Carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable.  She tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.Then there is Tim Roth.  His is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin.  Roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent General Thade.  He creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys I can remember in some time.  Additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.This film is a great disappointment.  It is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door.  I rated it a 3/10.  From a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10.  However, the story is an affront to the original franchise.  It is simply another attempt by Burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is.  Of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",2,Apes for dummies,1011916800,"01 25, 2002",2002,4107,"['film', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'attempts', 'capitalize', 'familiar', 'title', 'bring', 'vision', 'screen', 'done', 'Batman', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'now', 'not', 'remake', 'only', 'thing', 'common', 'original', 'simians', 'can', 'speak', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'cameo', 'Burton', 'reconstituted', 'entire', 'story', 'watering', 'down', 'today', 'mass', 'viewership.The', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'product', 'time', '1960', 'America', 'was', 'struggling', 'redefine', 'civilization', 'was', 'turbulent', 'time', 'soul', 'searching', 'rethinking', 'social', 'norms', 'was', 'civil', 'rights', 'era', 'where', 'groups', 'long', 'considered', 'inferior', 'demanded', 'be', 'treated', 'equal', 'context', 'POTA', 'was', 'allegorical', 'reflecting', 'philosophical', 'turmoil', 'confronting', 'audiences', 'day', 'POTA', 'was', 'extremely', 'intelligent', 'film', 'broached', 'difficult', 'questions', 'elegantly', 'held', 'oppressions', 'American', 'society', 'up', 'scrutiny', 'making', 'white', 'guy', 'justify', 'intelligence', 'species', 'considered', 'inferior', 'dialectic', 'Colonel', 'Taylor', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'Dr.', 'Cornelius', 'Roddy', 'McDowall', 'Dr.', 'Zira', 'Kim', 'Hunter', 'was', 'thought', 'provoking', 'intelligent', 'ironies', 'subtle', 'obvious.Burton', 'version', 'as', 'much', 'product', 'today', 'times', 'POTA', 'was', 'sixties', 'Apes', 'Dummies', 'superficial', 'jejune', 'substituting', 'politically', 'correct', 'platitudes', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'focusing', 'more', 'form', 'substance', 'surprise', 'ending', 'utterly', 'incongruous', 'nothing', 'film', 'cliffhanger', 'up', 'sequel', 'ending', 'original', 'POTA', 'gracefully', 'tied', 'everything', 'together', 'single', 'powerful', 'scene', 'Burton', 'ending', 'simply', 'audience', 'taunting', 'know', 'something', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'wait', 'sequel', 'find', 'out', 'technical', 'perspective', 'always', 'case', 'Burton', 'film', 'film', 'excellent', 'makeup', 'fantastic', 'Burton', 'camerawork', 'outstanding', 'continue', 'dislike', 'dark', 'look', 'However', 'thirty-three', 'years', 'advancements', 'prosthetic', 'makeup', 'can', 'not', 'compensate', 'insultingly', 'vacuous', 'script.The', 'story', 'been', 'reduced', 'monster', 'movie', 'humans', 'band', 'together', 'Captain', 'Davidson', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'fight', 'monstrous', 'Apes', 'aided', 'abetted', 'few', 'turncoats', 'notably', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Ari', 'presentation', 'formulaic', 'simplistic', 'plenty', 'violence', 'perfect', 'today', 'fast', 'food', 'mentality.The', 'acting', 'mixed', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'fine', 'actor', 'who', 'simply', 'miscast', 'role', 'Walberg', 'excellent', 'playing', 'dark', 'sullen', 'characters', 'are', 'tormented', 'strong', 'part', 'inspirational', 'hero', 'profile', 'not', 'Wahlberg', 'repertoire', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'character', 'so', 'far', 'ability', 'disconnect', 'laughable', 'desperately', 'do', 'something', 'flimsy', 'character', 'interpretation', 'presents', 'cross', 'college', 'peace', 'demonstrator', 'love', 'sick', 'teenager.Then', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'virtuoso', 'performance', 'single-handedly', 'saving', 'film', 'total', 'ruin', 'Roth', 'diabolically', 'hateful', 'malevolent', 'General', 'Thade', 'one', 'most', 'villainous', 'despicable', 'bad', 'guys', 'can', 'remember', 'time', 'Additionally', 'physical', 'acting', 'superlative', 'rendering', 'chimp-man', 'perfect', 'meld', 'one', 'can', 'almost', 'believe', 'species', 'exists.This', 'film', 'great', 'disappointment', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'as', 'long', 'check', 'brain', 'door', 'rated', '3/10', 'technical', 'perspective', 'much', 'better', 'perhaps', '9/10', 'However', 'story', 'affront', 'original', 'franchise', 'simply', 'attempt', 'Burton', 'self', 'adulation', 'using', 'familiar', 'title', 'attract', 'throngs', 'box', 'office', 'so', 'lots', 'people', 'can', 'see', 'what', 'genius', 'course', 'true', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'used', 'talent', 'produce', 'substantial', 'films', 'instead', 'simple', 'minded', 'pap', 'formulated', 'mass', 'consumption']",N/A

540913,AX93788O8JGBK,B00003CXXU,Gargamel,"[0, 0]","Being a formidable Burton-fan, his remake of the 1968 classic, THE PLANET OF THE APES, was an affair I'd looked forward to for quite a long time. But, after having seen the film, I regret to say that my emotions are mixed at best. First off, THE PLANET OF THE APES, doesn't have the feel of a Tim Burton film. The one thing I love the most about his films, are the characters in them. You really get to care for a Burton character. But the only character in this film that might resemble a previous Burton character, such as Edward Scissorhands or Jack Skellington, is Ari. She's the typical outcast in her society, set aside by her revolutionary ideas that humans should be treated equally as monkeys (sorry, apes&#65533;), but other than her there really aren't any other characters in this film that can evoke care and emotions. The film doesn't visually have the Burton-esque style to it, either. There are occasional shots where some of that Burton magic shines through, like when we see the ape-city at a distance (it looks bewitched), but for the most part the visual style of the film is typical Hollywood extravagance. It would actually seem fair to compare this film with BATMAN. Both films are financially huge projects, where the producers seems to have put a lid on Burton's imagination, perhaps in fair of loosing the bigger audience. 'Tis a shame&#65533; Also, the film doesn't feel grand. I, personally, was expecting a huge film. After seeing the intense trailers, I though THE PLANET OF THE APES would be a film that could give us a taste of what's to come, with LORD OF THE RINGS looming in the distance, speaking in terms of huge CGI made battles and such, but alas&#65533; There's only one such scene, and it's over in a flash.There are also several things that bothered me in the script. First off, the beginning, which was too short too explain why a pilot would risk his life going after an ape lost in an electromagnetic storm. More time should have been spent, or been spent more efficiently, on this bit. There was also stuff in the characters development, which didn't fit. *SPOILERS* There's a scene in the film where Ari sneaks back into the camp of the vicious Thade, to conduct some sort of peace meeting, where she ends up being branded by Thade with the mark of humans. The film doesn't explain why Ari would attempt such an act in the first place, or why Thade would just let Ari and Sandar, who accompany her, leave afterwards, and the scene isn't followed up later in the film. It's only there to give Thade a chance to mark Ari. The writers should have thought of another way for this to happen. Also, towards the end of the film, we see Colonel Attar suddenly betray his patron, Thade, after, for the most part, being a pretty grim ape himself. It didn't seem like a logical course of action for this character. They should have sown the seeds for such an act earlier in the film. I also thought the filmmakers dispatched Sandar too easily. He was the former superior of Thade, but cast into shame when Thade betrayed him, and in the battle scene, where he's supposed to fight his previous prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he's intervened by Colonel Attar and defeated in a minute or so. I would have thought such a character, as Sandar, would have deserved a better exit.The ending, high above all things, must be discussed. Naturally, there was a huge amount of pressure on the filmmakers to come up with an ending that would match the original 68-ending, and take it's audience by surprise. It seems to me, that in their desperation to concur such an ending, they exit the film with more questions than answers. *HUGE SPOILER* I see only two possible answers to the end: (a) Everything took place on earth all along, and Captain Leo Davidson has only been traveling back and forth in time, as in the original film, or that (b) we are talking about two different planets. If it's the first, (a), then Captain Leo Davidson should have been able to figure all this out, by calculating coordinates and such, and if it's the second, (b), then how in the nine hells did Thade make his way to earth? Puzzling.Tim Roth, who stars as Thade, makes it clear that he's one of the meanest villains out there. Mark Wahlberg is a fine enough actor, who's done better before, that pulls of the part of Captain Leo Davidson nice enough, not being especially heroic, but not too much of an anti-hero either. Helena Bonham-Carter, as Ari, is, next to Tim Roth, the best actor on the cast. Putting Michael Clarke Duncan behind the make-up of Colonel Attar was also a good move on Burton's behalf. First off, because he's big enough to fit the role, and second, because his melancholic eyes are perhaps the only thing that lends credibility to the fact that he chooses to disobey his patron, Thade. Paul Giamatti was superb, creating comical relief with Limbo, the slave trader. Estella Warren, in her skimpy Xena outfit, was incognito at best. So, all in all, as I arrive upon my conclusion, it must be said that THE PLANET OF THE APES is a pretty entertaining film, if nothing else. The film is clearly less political than it's predecessor. It seems to have no ambitions. It only wants to entertain. And so it does, many thanks to a good enough cast, great make-up, enough funny scenes, and, last but not least, an excellent villain",3,it's entertainment,997488000,"08 11, 2001",2001,5345,"['Being',

I might add that ""Planet of the Apes"" has gone on to become a cult favorite. Go figureWell, I spotted ""Planet of the Apes"" on the five-dollar Wal-Mart bargain rack and dropped it into the cart. Last night I viewed it. Just as I figured in the early 70s, this thing was just pure nonsense in every way. It's amusing nonsense, but nonsense nevertheless. The setting didn't look like another planet at all. It looked like the Colorado Plateau and the ""lake"" was one of the large reservoirs. Trust me.The story was more of a tongue-in-cheek comedy than serious science fiction. Well, I'm probably too critical and it made for rsomewhat entertaining viewing.

He also loves to make beautiful pictures, esp. those that take place in dark worlds. This picture is no exception.If you like to go to movies to see wonderful make-up, realistic full-size monkeys ... er, apes and a few moments with terrific stunts and special effects, then you may well love this movie. If you love to have your inteligence insulted at the same time, this is a perfect vehicle.From the opening scene, there is very little doubt of where this film is going. Of course, considering it is a remake ... um, revisioning of the classic, where it is going is not too much of a surprise. Of course, in interviews, Burton stated the ending was more shocking than the original. I contend this could only happen if you fell asleep for most of the movie, as the ending is pretty much telegraphed throughout the flick.The plot is rather weak. Unlike the original, which developed characters and slowly built up to a shocking climax, this film pretty much goes on full bore (you can use either definition here, as both fit). It plods along without much guidance. And, forget character building. When one of the humans tied closely to our lead characters sacrifices himself for some of the others, there is absolutely no sympathy or empathy. He is just dead; so what!There is one clever plot device that deals with the fact that apes can't swim (or rather are afraid of the water). This is largely brought in to cause major debates about the ending of the movie, if any one would really care to debate. It really serves no other purpose, although Burton tries to throw you off track here.The primary reason I can see for anyone recommending this is to see just how beautiful the vision is.

540918,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B00003CXXU,General Breadbasket,"[0, 1]","""Planet of the Apes"" is a remake of sorts of the 1968 film of the same name, directed by Tim Burton. I haven't seen the original, but I thought I'd see the remake first to minimize disappointment by comparison. I really liked it, actually, and once again I'm suprised at the low average amazon response.It's 2029, and a space station is sending chimps out into space to investigate a large magnetic storm. Leo is an astronaut there, and one of the trainers of the chimp. His favorite is sent to investigate the storm, and vanishes within it, so Leo blasts off after it in his spacecraft. There is a bright flash of light, and Leo crash lands on a wild jungle of a planet, full of talking Apes, who keep timid humans as slaves. There are a few that are compassionate towards humans, but only a few. Where has Leo landed? His homing beacon still works, and it appears his crewmates have landed on the other side of the planet. If he can make it back to them, he'll be able to escape this savage, nightmarish world. But will he be able to escape?Apart from the Danny Elfman score, it would be hard to tell this was a Tim Burton film, if you didn't already know. Then again, Burton's spookhouse quirks don't really lend themselves to remakes of 1960s sci-fi, so maybe that's why they're kept to a minimum here. The special effects, the design of the spaceships, the costumes and makeup are all really classy I thought. They're great to look at, but they're not overdone or obsessed with being state-of-the-art. It's a heartfelt retro, rather than a slavish imitation, I thought. I also thought the way the Ape soldiers moved, closely mimicking real life primates, was a really interesting touch. I haven't seen the original, but I know enough about it to tell you that the ending is very different in this version. I'm still trying to piece together why it concluded in the way it did, its a bit of a head scratcher (in a good way, though)...Personally I think it's worth a look for sci-fi fans.

Every frame is packed with so much detail and so much action you won't want to blink. What Burton paints with images, Danny Elfman matches with sound with yet another excellent score. But it's clear from the get-go that the real stars here are the apes who look and move so wonderfully realistically, you'll forget that they're not.The makeup is so good in The Planet of The Apes it's hard to see the actor behind the mask. But this seems more an asset than a liability for the ape actors who all put in very strong performances. Unfortunately the 'human' actors are another story: Mark Wahlberg is clearly out of his league and depth here and really struggles to carry the lead. There's a scene where Wahlberg tries to rally the troops and he was so bad, it's funny. Estella Warren looks great but does very little in a role that is really not much more than window dressing.As with many visually stunning films, more care and attention was paid to the look of The Planet of The Apes than the script, so we're asked to make some pretty big leaps of faith.

540928,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00003CXXU,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[6, 8]","am a big Tim Burton fan, I've practically seenall his movies: ""Batman"" , ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""The Nightmare before Christmas"" are the Directors best works to name a few.But when I first heard, that Director Tim Burtonwas going to make a remake of the original classic sci fi movie ""Planet Of The Apes"" with Charlton Heston, I was skeptical. Everyone knows that remakes of classic movies 90% of the time, plain suck. The movie remake of ""Psycho"" is a good example. I was further skeptical that Tim Burton's remake would equal the success of the original because all the ideas thought possible were used for the ""Planet Of The Apes"" series and movies.Apes going into space, an Ape's son taking over the world, and even mutant beings are just a couple of the ideas that were used for the four sequels and 2 television series that wanted to profit of the 1968 film. Now after watching the film , my gut instinct told me I was right. The New version of Planet of The Apes is highlly predictable, copying a large bulk of material from the original, with brief differences.Probably the biggest problem is that this movie itself has is the lame, and dumbest ending I've seen. It makes me laugh just thinking about it. It makes me laugh more because this was a Tim Burton film. In fact, the ending looks like it was written by a 13 yr old, who has too many cheap sci fi films with bad endings. The end of the film, lets you down with an incredibly stupid ending that makes you feel like you wasted time watching it.Even Tim Burton commented after the film, that he would not make another sequel. Apparently, even he knew that his movie failed. Now my review of the film:Planet of The Apes starts with great visual effects,as we learn that an Air Force Space Station has occupied the universe. Mark Walhberg plays Captain Leo Davidson,who is teaching scientific chimps how to pilot space vessels for research. Basically, the chimps are sent as probes , if you will, to uncharted planets. However, something goes wrong, and the head chimp, gets lost on a voyage to a planet. Davidson, caring for the chimp, disobeys orders and goes after him.Now then comes the copying of the original film into the remake,but Burton tries his best or worst to not make it look like a copycat film.Davidson is eventually captured by the Apes of the Planet. Just like the original film, the Apes personality traits are split by class. The warriors are made mostly of Apes and Gorillas. The lying and cunniving politicians are made up of Urangantans. While the more sympathetic apes relate more to the chimp class.In the original fim, Charlton Heston has the famous line that all fans know when he is captured by the Apes:""Let go of me you damn dirty ape"".However, Burton changes the script to not copy the original. In the remake, it is the ape who use a line similiar to this:""Let go of me you damn dirty human""Lol. I laughed for a while when I saw this.It's just a very dumb scene. Because even Burton changed the lines, it's still trying to copy that classic scene from the original. Anyways Davidson is captured and eventually meets the head Ape of the planet. Davidson is eventually put into the lines of human slaves that the apes have. Here also Burton tries to add differences between this film and the original. If you recall in the original, Charlton Heston was the only human who could think and talk, while all the over humans either had labotomies or had their throats cut out.This made Heston's character, Taylor, much more unique and dangerous to the apes. In the remake though, Burton makes it so all humans can talk. This made Walhberg's character not as unique and dangerous, as the original Heston characterm, hell it made him average, not standing out from the crowd.Tim Roth, plays the evil General Thade who is the military dictator in control of the planet. For the most part, Roth's part is admirable, he does display that aura of intimidation and fear, that all villians in the movie have, but all of this is ripped to shreds by the horrible ending of the film.Eventually Davidson and the rest of his human and ape friends stage a revolt against General Thade to see who will rule the planet.This is actually one of the few good points of the film,Burton gives you the hope that things will turn out the best in the end, but not necessarily... Without giving away the ending of the film, all I can say is that it is one of the cheesiest, dumbest endings I've seen!!! In fact, my first reaction to the ending was disbelief, followed by sheer laughter. I couldn't believe that Burton had done that type of ending. The ending reminds me of those low budget, cheap sci fi endings from the 1950's and 60's. If I wanted to see sci fi movies with a cheap , laughable, ending I would watched the reruns of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000""!!.What upsets me about the ending, is that before the ending, we are lead to believe that the movie is going to end one way. In fact, if the movie ended up the way I thought it was going to end, I would have given it a perfect 10!!! But Burton (I don't know what he was thinking)sabotages, the good film with a cheap ending, that leaves you feeling rip-offed. He is not the only guy to do this, the legendary Roman Polanski likewise had the dumbest ending of his career in the movie ""Femme Fatale"" with Antonio Banderas.Several weeks after the movie was released, Burton said he would not do a sequel to ""Planet Of The Apes"". It seems that Burton himself, knew that he messed up a perfectly good film and , proved that remakes of classic films should be left alone. I am big Tim Burton fan, but the remake of ""Planet Of The Apes"" is probably the worst film that he has done.",1,(...),1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,5719,"['am', 'big', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'fan',

I've been awaiting the arrival of &quot;P.O.T.A.&quot; for quite some time, and was a little hesitant about it from the trailors and whatnot.  I was still excited for it nonetheless.  After reading the reviews from Roger Ebert and EW, which gave it fairly poor reviews, I knew it was going to rock.  I mean, EW and Ebert both gave my favorite movie, &quot;FIGHT CLUB&quot;, a pretty poor review upon it's initial release.  Ever since that happened, I went with this logic: If they give it a bad review, it must be great.  So I went into &quot;P.O.T.A.&quot; with higher expectations than I really wanted to; afraid of being disappointed.I wasn't.  It surpassed all my expectations, and has quickly escalated to the top of my favorite Sci-Fi flicks.  Not only was the make-up fantastic(hand Rick Baker an Oscar!), the acting of the apes was pretty damn awesome.  I give all the ape-portrayers much appreciation for having to endure what they did for this film.  The best ape would have to be Tim Roth, in his portrayal of Thade.  Thade is unquestionably one of the besyt villains since the Joker in the original &quot;BATMAN&quot;(also directed by Burton, coincidence?).  I hated Thade for all that he was and stood for, which in the end made him my favorite character.  Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti, Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Hiryuki-Tagawa(?) also deserve praise for their portrayals of characters.  As for the humans, they didn't do as great a job.  Estella Warren wasn't in it quite enough, and Mark Wahlberg did a good job, except for one delivery, inspiring the humans.  Tim Burton?  This guy knows how ti direct!  I think that he's grown and matured from just his last film, &quot;Sleep Hollow&quot;.  One perfect example of this is a beautiful dolly near the end, going from Attar, revealing Krull.This is definitely a film you absolutely must see before Summers end.  I really loved this, and seen it twice already.  I'm gonna try a third time, hopefully it won't be gone by then.  There's not much to dislike about this film, contrary to what one reviewer in particular said(Jeff, I think was the name).  The make-up alone is worth the price of admission, the ape-portrayals are another, and the best ending since &quot;FIGHT CLUB&quot; is another.  Don't miss this.

That was all very well. However, as soon as we got to know the nature of the apes, I started to really despise this movie. I thought it was pathetic, gay and boring. That lasted for about 25 minutes or so and then BAM! the action hit me like a bomb and I loved it. That lasted for pretty much the rest of the movie. All of it was a blast after the crappy parts in the ape city and I was really entertained watching the adventure and escapist story. The apes themselves can be sort of unintentionally funny at times, but the make-up for them was amazing! Wow, I just gave up trying to guess who the actors where after a while because the ape make-up was so astounding and convincing, you couldn't even tell who's eyes were under that hunk of hair! The actors do well, Mark Wahlberg fits the leading role well and gives it his all. I don't think his character was very considerate and I think he tried to be a little too much like Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, but apart from that, he's done well. Helena Bonham Carter was really fantastic and has the pleasure of playing the most developed character in Planet of the Apes, giving her character and performance depth, more-so than Wahlberg's sometimes selfish hero. Tim Roth was evil and believable. Tim Burton's direction shines through the movie, especially the final reel. He puts focus to his camera-work and knows he's up to the job.

The plot is basic. Humans are not the superior beings on ""Planet of the Apes"", but rather slaves.  A million metaphors can be made about the role reversals in this film.  Some of the most publicized views have been about racism, animal cruelty, or even the concept of whether animals have souls. If you watch this movie with friends, talking some of these arguments over can be fun.The movie is Good, but not Great.  I have to stick by my four stars.  The acting left something to be desired. I did however, like Thorn, the general of the Ape clan. His role was outstanding. Walberg, was mediocre. He had few lines, but at least some of them were understated sarcasm.  I found myself giggling once in a while  (i.e.. ""Never send a monkey to do a man's job"").The DVD version comes with two CD's. The first is obviously the film, but the second is a treasure in itself. It gives a glimpse into things such as the ""monkey school"" where the actors attended to learn to look like apes.  They were trained extensively to look, walk, run, and act more like the apes they play.  I thought it fascinating to see them out of their make-up, galloping as real people trying to perfect the movements.  And what movements they are!  The make-up and movement of the apes in this film is so real, nothing of this caliber has ever been achieved before. It is very convincible and awe-inspiring.My only major problem with the film is it's ending. Obviously, I can't explain too much, except to tell you some that saw this movie disliked it, or were left confused. That's okay though. What makes me angry, is that I discovered Part 2 to this movie was already in the works! A tricky marketing scheme that nearly guarantees we will all surface again to see the answer to our bewildered questions.  This is nothing new. King's book ""Hearts in Atlantis"" was released to the theaters in half. The second half of that book is yet to be released.

540942,A22AYBS7O7GY3Z,B00003CXXU,"Jacob Malewitz ""areaderseye.blogspot.com""","[0, 1]","A storyline set outside the old Apes movies, this one's a stand alone movie.  Mark Wahlberg, an astronaught, crashes on an unknown planet after going through some sort of space storm.  He's gone hundreds of years into the future into a different part of the universe.  Soon he finds that there are humans on this planet, but their not the dominant species they were on earth.I had some doubts going into this movie, but I was hoping to be proved wrong.  Sadly I was not.  It's not bad in terms of the overall series but the original, with a much smaller budget and less technology, defeated this one hands down.  Who's to blame?  Burton's directing and Wahlberg's acting were certainly not.  The screen writer is to blame in writing  a very corny, slow, and downright idiotic movie.  While there was some decent action, some interesting back story, the movie seemed to drag along after about a half an hour.  Some scenes just didn't even make sense.  In one scene, when Wahlberg and his compatriots are attempting to cross a river through an army encampment ahead of them, the soldiers all leave their horses in front of the base unprotected.  Guess what happens in the next scene?  Also apes are afraid of water because they cannot swim.  They won't even go ankle deep which makes the human escape across the river with the hijacked horses even easier.  Lame.  Want more?  Turn away if you don't want to know more scenes but these aren't really spoilers by any means.  A very annoying young kid pops up throughout the movie wanting to help and not be treated like a kid.  He is vocal about this any chance he can be, though this isn't that bad, towards the big final battle scene he decides to go to the front of the line.  They are going to retreat and draw the apes in.  Guess when happens when they start running back?  He falls of his horse and must be saved by Wahlberg at the LAST second.  That one was the worst for me.  If the movie had been better, scenes like that could have been overlooked.  But their were just too many scenes that ... for being so unrealistic and downright annoying. Combine that with a slow, somewhat boring, pace and you've got a bad movie.Burton has always been known for bringing a dark aspect to to his movies, Nightmare Before Christmas Edward Scissorhands, but this was not what you wanted in a Planet of the Apes movie.  Still I attribute some of the slow pace to him, but not all of it.  At first I thought Wahlberg might bring a different dimension to the movie, he is far from a Heston type actor, but scenes where he could act were limited.  His character just didn't fit the movie.  He wasn't the imposing presence that stood for humanities determination like Heston.  I was hoping he could pull off something different than Heston but still pleasing to the ""humans are the best"" thoughts going through my head.  Wahlberg is a good actor but this just wasn't the part for him, same forBurton and his directing.  This could have been so much better, honestly Jurassic Park 3(released a week earlier in theatres and Apes main competitor) beat this.

540943,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00003CXXU,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[6, 8]","The remake is worth the nearly two hours it lasts. Tim Burton packed the story with all kinds of action and dramatic tragedy at every turn in the plot that is thickening as fast as it is sickening, and  that is an understatement. Brilliant job, Tim! When are you doing the sequel? He injected a lot of believable realism and that planet where apes have taken over on humans, does not make humans regress to speechlessness because that is impossible, and absolutely absurd. They have regressed to living in villages that we will never see but they do dress properly, they do behave with some kind of humanity, or human-ness at least. Even those that have been reduced to being slaves or pets keep some kind of dignity in their fate or doom. They can even rebel when the occasion come sup and flee if possible. They even gather to fight a final fight, if final it has to be. The battle for the extermination of humans on one side and for the right to live free and equal on the other side is realistic and strong, powerful with many twists at the end of the film. Twist to reduce the militaristic feeling to one man, sorry ape, that can be isolated and neutralized. The details are in the film and not easy to imagine. The next twist is the arrival of a vanished astroape, or rather monkey due to its size. He comes back just in time and in the nick of time the coming back of the monkey messiah saves the day for everyone. Charmingly romantic but charmingly charming. The best twist is of course the return of the prodigal astronaut on earth, at the foot of Abraham Lincoln. What a surprise there, what a surprise then! Life is really absurd to provide you with such surprises. And the best of it all is that you do not see the zippers in the back of the apes and you don't see the plastic masks on their faces. Is the film in anyway revealing of our twenty-first century? I think it is, revealing of what was to come and we did not know yet at the time in 2001, but we know now and have learned since then. The crazy violence of a few clandestine warmongers, and an expedition into hostile territory to free them by imposing an even worse yoke. And the end and how it can or could come, an end that will not be bloodless and easy for anyone but that will be worked out by the people directly concerned and not by invaders from another planet, even if it is only another part of the same planet.

Instead, Tim Burton has given us a fresh, entirely new interpertation of the Apes saga, and I for one think it really works very well for its pumped up discussion of the slavery and polotical issues, and it certianly was entertaining enough.  While it was never going to be anything to rival the 1968 Apes, and wisely didn't try to be, the hotly debated, misguided ending (which I will not reveal here) went and brought the entire movie down a couple notches.  Had the last 5 minutes or so been cut, this all would have been a very nice ""reimagining,"" and it does have its good points, but it's clear that the director and his editor didn't know when to finish it.  Shame.That said, the question in your mind is probably, ""Is it still worth seeing?"" and the answer to that is a rousing Yes!

The first 15 minutes gave me some hope - nice special effects, good setup to a different planet of the apes and even a funny reference to the first movie thrown in.  But from there on out it went straight downhill.Despite over $100 million dollars - I still felt like I was watching a fake movie set, I kept expecting to see a boom mike accidentally show up.  Secondly there was no 'humanity' to the movie.  The whole point of the original movie and book was to make you question man's treatment of man and of the animal world, in this version you get about 5 minutes haphazardly thrown in.  Next, the fact that all the humans actually speak english takes away a major element of the story.  It makes no sense that humans would be slaves if they could talk and make strategy.  Plus about 100 other plot holes.Then the dialogue is atrocious.  How many cliche's and hackneyed stupid sayings could they possibly put into the movie - 'why can't we all just get along.'  There is a difference between sublte irony and pretentious wittiness.  Cheesy dialogue is acceptable from an inexperienced movie maker, not here.  There was a whole plot line never developed between Helen Carter's ape, Leo (Mark W.) and the blond captive girl.  Like many other reviewers I found myself liking the apes a lot more.  Plus stealing scenes from the book is NOT the same as bringing out the essence of the book...  Instead the movie falls back on marketing and making of specials.

A trained chimpanzee, Pericles, is in a space craft. He is pushing buttons. Realizing he is about to crash, he goes ape s***. Just then, Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) appears in front of the screen. It was only a flight simulator test. The chimp loses again.  They are in the USAF Oberon Space Station.  Leo has been in space for 2 years. As he receives a video postcard from home, an electromagnetic storm nearby causes the power to go out for a few seconds. The crew decides to send the chimp into a pod to go into the central core. Leo wants to do it himself, but rules are rules.  Something goes wrong. Leo gets into another pod against orders and launches. He goes through disturbances and loses contact with the Oberon. The counter is going crazy. It's at October 26, 2040 and speeds to August 21, 2427 and stops at 5021. He crash lands on a planet into a pond in the jungle. Leo escapes the pod and swims to land. He then sees a man (Kris Kristofferson) and a woman running. They are being attacked by Apes in armour. The Apes can talk like a human on Earth. Leo is on the Planet of the Apes.Also in the cast: Tim Roth, Estella Warren, Michael Clarke Duncan, Helena Bonham Carter, Paul Giamatti, David Warner, Glenn Shadix, Philip Tan, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Jay Cuputo, Lisa Marie, Rick Baker.I really did not like this movie, but the scenes with Charlton Heston were enjoyable.

Surprisingly, some of the most human traits were brought out by Helena Bonham Carter's ape character Ari, with Michael Clarke Duncan as the fearsome warrior Attar.  With the film's main focus on the visuals and action, the character development seemed somewhat lacking and hollow at times.Unfortunately the story is flawed, with many questions unexplained, and many interesting angles unexplored.  But overall under the imaginative direction of Tim Burton, Planet of the Apes is a visual effect treat that no one should miss.  Packed with non-stop action, there is not a dull moment in this movie.  From the futuristic space station to the savage land where the apes ruled, each set is beautifully and wondefully shot, with a great soundtrack to make the experience even better.  There is a twilight zone-esque feeling from start to finish, leaving just enough room at the end for a possible sequel.

540951,A2X5FCG9AUP9VP,B00003CXXU,jcphoenix,"[1, 1]","Tim Burton is my favourite director, and Danny Elfman is, in my opinion, the best film composer there is. (yes, I think he's better than John Williams, etc) That said, it should be pretty obvious that I consider them to be the best director/composer duo (they work together on almost every film) there ever was, is, or will be. Unfortunately, one of that duo has disappointed. While I have never been disappointed by Burton, movies like Mars Attack, and Beetlejuice are really not my type of movie. (That being said, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and The Nightmare Before Christmas are my favourite Burton films -notice a pattern there?) And, this time, I really was disappointed by Burton.Sure, it was a good movie. But not up to Burton's normal standards in my opinion. The visuals are above average, but again, not on par with his normal vast imagination. His style is less apparent here, seeming like he is toning it down for mainstream entertainment. The problem is, Tim Burton is anything BUT mainstream. The only film he has ever really done that was ""mainstream"" was Batman, and even that was filled with his amazing imagination and visuals.The plot was one of the most twisty ones that I have seen for a while; unfortunately, the ending was somewhat predictable. As I write this, I am still puzzled, and perhaps this review will be rewritten later on if I understand it. Its hard to explain this without giving anything away. It was predictable that the ""surprise"" would happen, but they never really explained how it came to pass. It would be nice to get my hands on the dvd and commentary, etc because I still cannot fully believe that Burton would just tack on a surprise ending without clues (like Swordfish) throughout the movie. The video had a small clip showing all the clues leading towards the ending, but some things just don't seem to fit. Anyway, I will definitely try to get my hands on the dvd, which will perhaps explain more.Another thing that brought this movie down further was the terrible screenplay. Not the actual plot, mind you, but the dialogue was very simple, and many lines were just plain silly. I think even a three year old could do a much more brilliant screenplay for this - that tells you how badly this screenplay stinks.The make-up work done by Rick Baker was at times Oscar worthy, but seemed very unevenly spread. It was obvious that the best make-up he did was for Thade (played by Tim Roth) while others were just plain ridiculous to look at. My family had a good laugh at some of the outrageous looking apes. Overall, it wasn't as great as I was expecting. If he could have done something similar to Thade's make-up for the rest of the apes, it would have improved the experience by a lot. I just could not get over the cheesy look of some of the apes for the first half, and that coupled with bad dialogue constantly lessened my enjoyment.The acting was not dynamic by any of the parties involved, but nonetheless, it did not detract from the experience either. The whole cast did the best they could with super lame dialogue. Also, Estella Warren was not too bad in this movie -definitely not as bad as she was in Driven, and not as bad as the reviews have suggested.While one of the dynamic duo may have disappointed, the other one certainly didn't. Elfman does another cool and very different score, certainly up there with his MIB, Edward Scisorhands, and The Simpsons themes/scores. Very unusual, with a marching, and almost ""strict"" quality to it. I also have to comment that it is great that he finally gets so much on the dvds he does movies for. (Many of the movies he does scores for include an audio track with only the score)Despite all the bad points, I did enjoy the film. After I got over some of the stupid lines, etc, I did manage to find myself involved in the story. I'm really just picking out all the small things as I am disappointed in Burton. But, if you can stand really silly humour, a bit of bad make-up, and some confusing plot points, this is a rather fun movie (with an excellent score).Now that you've done a big mainstream film, get back to arthouse films Burton.",3,"Twisty plot, but dragged down significantly by bad dialogue",1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,4152,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'favourite', 'director', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'opinion', 'best', 'film', 'composer', 'yes', 'think', 'better', 'John', 'Williams', 'etc', 'said', 'should', 'be', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'consider', 'be', 'best', 'director/composer', 'duo', 'work', 'together', 'almost', 'film', 'ever', 'was', 'will', 'be', 'Unfortunately', 'one', 'duo', 'disappointed', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'disappointed', 'Burton', 'movies', 'Mars', 'Attack', 'Beetlejuice', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'type', 'movie', 'being', 'said', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'Nightmare', 'Christmas', 'are', 'favourite', 'Burton', 'films', '-notice', 'pattern', 'there', 'time', 'really', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Burton.Sure', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'Burton', 'normal', 'standards', 'opinion', 'visuals', 'are', 'above', 'average', 'again', 'not', 'par', 'normal', 'vast', 'imagination', 'style', 'less', 'apparent', 'here', 'seeming', 'toning', 'down', 'mainstream', 'entertainment', 'problem', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'anything', 'BUT', 'mainstream', 'only', 'film', 'ever', 'really', 'done', 'was', 'mainstream', 'was', 'Batman', 'even', 'was', 'filled', 'amazing', 'imagination', 'visuals.The', 'plot', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'twisty', 'ones', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'unfortunately', 'ending', 'was', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'write', 'am', 'still', 'puzzled', 'perhaps', 'review', 'will', 'be', 'rewritten', 'later', 'understand', 'hard', 'explain', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'was', 'predictable', 'surprise', 'would', 'happen', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'how', 'came', 'pass', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'get', 'hands', 'dvd', 'commentary', 'etc', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'fully', 'believe', 'Burton', 'would', 'just', 'tack', 'surprise', 'ending', 'clues', 'Swordfish', 'movie', 'video', 'had', 'small', 'clip', 'showing', 'clues', 'leading', 'ending', 'things', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'fit', 'Anyway', 'will', 'definitely', 'try', 'get', 'hands', 'dvd', 'will', 'perhaps', 'explain', 'more.Another', 'thing', 'brought', 'movie', 'down', 'further', 'was', 'terrible', 'screenplay', 'Not', 'actual', 'plot', 'mind', 'dialogue', 'was', 'very', 'simple', 'many', 'lines', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'silly', 'think', 'even', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'do', 'much', 'more', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'how', 'badly', 'screenplay', 'stinks.The', 'make-up', 'work', 'done', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'was', 'times', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'seemed', 'very', 'unevenly', 'spread', 'was', 'obvious', 'best', 'make-up', 'did', 'was', 'Thade', 'played', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'others', 'were', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'look', 'family', 'had', 'good', 'laugh', 'outrageous', 'looking', 'apes', 'Overall', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'was', 'expecting', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'similar', 'Thade', 'make-up', 'rest', 'apes', 'would', 'have', 'improved', 'experience', 'lot', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'cheesy', 'look', 'apes', 'first', 'half', 'coupled', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'constantly', 'lessened', 'enjoyment.The', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'dynamic', 'parties', 'involved', 'nonetheless', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'experience', 'either', 'whole', 'cast', 'did', 'best', 'could', 'super', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'Also', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'bad', 'movie', '-definitely', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'Driven', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'reviews', 'have', 'suggested.While', 'one', 'dynamic', 'duo', 'may', 'have', 'disappointed', 'other', 'one', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'Elfman', 'cool', 'very', 'different', 'score', 'certainly', 'there', 'MIB', 'Edward', 'Scisorhands', 'Simpsons', 'themes/scores', 'Very', 'unusual', 'marching', 'almost', 'strict', 'quality', 'also', 'have', 'comment', 'great', 'finally', 'so', 'much', 'dvds', 'movies', 'Many', 'movies', 'scores', 'include', 'audio', 'track', 'only', 'score', 'bad', 'points', 'did', 'enjoy', 'film', 'got', 'stupid', 'lines', 'etc', 'did', 'manage', 'find', 'involved', 'story', ""'m"", 'really', 'just', 'picking', 'out', 'small', 'things', 'am', 'disappointed', 'Burton', 'can', 'stand', 'really', 'silly', 'humour', 'bit', 'bad', 'make-up', 'confusing', 'plot', 'points', 'rather', 'fun', 'movie', 'excellent', 'score', ""'ve"", 'done', 'big', 'mainstream', 'film', 'get', 'back', 'arthouse', 'films', 'Burton']",N/A

It's a completely different movie, yet you continue to compare it to the original.  Here's an original thought: Try looking at Tim Burton's film as a COMPLETELY NEW FILM, with NOTHING in common with the &quot;original&quot; POTA from 1968 (aside from the basic story element of a planet ruled by apes).  You'll find it has more going for it than you realize.For my review, I'll be short.. there's been enough full reviews here already.  The occasional holes in the story are the only things that hurt this film.  The acting by all involved was top-notch (even from Wahlburg.. take a look at his character, he's SUPPOSED to act that way).  Tim Roth stole the show, of course.  Extrememly high production values.. fantastic sets, locations, makeup, VFX by ILM.. few movies look this good.  Tim Burton said that this film was NOT a &quot;remake&quot; of the original, which is precisely why you shouldn't try to compare the two.  I own both of them side by side on my rack, and view them as completely separate films.For the DVD review, this is a supurb example of a feature-laden DVD.  Tons of extra features on Disc 2.. In-depth looks at Ape schooling, makeup, wire work, several behind-the-scenes features.. this disc has it all.  As a filmmaker, it's amazing to see a DVD go into such great detail about the production.  The film itself is a very good transfer, very sharp, excellent sound.All in all, an excellent movie, I think.

If all the apes don't have the mannerisms of apes, we won't necessarily hold it against the movie.  Here, however, I think I do.  The problem is that Tim Roth does such a great job as General Thale that you find yourself believing that he is an ape.  Conversely, Helena Bonham Carter is merely an actress is makeup.  She does act like an ape.  If all or none of the actors adopted the mannerisms, I would have been fine.  It should not be done in part.In the old series and movie, we accelerate to the distant future to find that apes rule the world.  Here, the same happens, but it is not to rise up against being enslaved, but violence brought on by the planet somehow.  This loses some of the original movie's effect.

I can't list the number of plot holes and ridiculous logic leaps, combined with the very, very bad innacurracies.  On top of all that, it's a pretty weak story.  How can producers sign off on this basuda?One thing among many that really irked me was the fact that the humans were perfectly normal and intelligent, but they couldn't fight the apes.  What the - ?  I can understand if the humans were afflicted, like in Sirling's version, but in this case they're just, like, lazy or something.Also, how could the ancient crashed spacecraft still operate and fire its engines?  High tech equipment is in demand of non-stop maintenance, to say nothing of the chemical changes that would rot all working components of an engine, and the changes the fuel would undergo.  If this movie had tried to portray itself as less serious and give an air of camp and fun, I could let it go.  But this movie was trying to be serious, and all I could see were the non-stop plot holes.  And how could the general be so dumb as to say &quot;We can't fight that?&quot;  All he has to do is send his remaining forces around the sides of the ship.  Ugh.I also didn't like the way the movie picked on the original.  The quote &quot;Get your hands off me you damn dirty human,&quot; could suffice to nod to the original.  But they took it too far.  Any Charlton Heston fan knows that he's been trying to shake his Planet of the Apes memory for years, and he'd jump at a chance to pick on himself and the movie.  But it was distracting and insulting to a good movie.The thing that makes me mad is that this could have been a great movie.  The actors, FX, and artistic direction were OUTSTANDING.  But the screenplay should have been used as a wee-wee pad for someone's pet.  In any case, I'm sure there are some people out there that will appreciate this, but the only reason I sat through this was because I believed Burton would redeem himself and turn it into a good movie.  At the end I asked for a refund from the ticket office and they gave me one.  I wasn't the only one who left the theater very, very disappointed.

Cramer ""wazuppie765""","[0, 1]","I was highly anticipating the release of this movie, and when it finally came out and I saw it, I walked out of the theatre part impressed, a little disappointed, and a bit confused.First of all, there's a lot of impressive material in this movie. To start off, the ape makeup is teriffic. While the makeup in the orignal was only average, watching this version I was completely satisfied. Another thing that was great which is related to the ape makeup was how the actors trained for months before making the movie to learn how to move like apes. All of the movements in the movie look very realistic. So, all in all, the apes look fantastic.Another noteworthy aspect is the special effects and the music. The special effects are better than you see in most of today's films (mid-2002) and the music (by Danny Elfman, who also did the music for Spider Man and Batman) is fantastic. It's hard to describe how good it is; you have to hear it for yourself. The last thing in this movie that impressed me was the ending. (Not the very end) It was filled with tons of action in an all-out battle with apes vs. humans.Now the things that I wasn't impressed with. First of all, although the movie includes a lot of well-known actors, (Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Charelton Heston, and Michael Clarke Duncan to name a few) most of the acting is not that good. Mark Wahlberg is incredibly flat and after a while you get tired of listining to him. Also, Estella Warren still lacks acting abilities. She is alright in this film, but for looks only. The only actors that deserve recognintion in this movie are Tim Roth and Paul Giamatti.Another bad thing about this movie is the ending. It was a bit too confusing for my tastes. I think even the screenwriters didn't even know what they were writing when they wrote the ending for this movie.The DVD is great, boasting tons of featurettes, a commentary with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, deleted/extended scenes, good picture and sound quality, and more that should keep you busy for a couple of nights.All in all, this is a pretty good film which could've been oustanding if not for some of the annoyances that plagued the film.

It's not exactly his best, his weakest next to Mars Attacks but just like that you can't say it doesn't fail to entertain. One problem with it is that eventhough Mark Wahlberg can act but he doesn't do much for the movie eventhough he trys very hard. Hell his character that gets stuck on this planet just because he follows his test chimp's space pod into a time warp is hardly engaging either. I think his buddy George Clooney should of played the part actually. Eventhough the character is weak Clooney probably could of added a lot more charm to the role. The actors playing the apes definetly outshine Wahlberg, especially Tim Roth (Rob Roy) who gives another Oscar worthy performance. When his character's angry and he flips around making ape noises....you're scared. Not hard to see why he's leader, not the kind of ape you want to mess with.  Although this remake won't be called a classic 30 years from now, in some ways it totally outshines the original. The make-up is a lot more realistic and unlike the original, this one has a lot more action. One thing is for though the ending to this one is a lot less powerful. It's funny don't get me wrong but it doesn't compare to the originals at all.

Bryan,"[0, 1]","Tim Burton's &quot;reimagining&quot; of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; features some outstanding make up effects, and some interesting set designs:  Ape City looks like a moldy wedding cake.  And I don't mean that in a bad way.  It's a multi-layered world full of jungle creepers and jungle creeps, the apes themselves.  But that's about as Burton-esque as this movie gets before turning into generic summer blockbuster crapola, only this time with monkeys instead of Nazis, communists, aliens or terrorists.  It's full of ludicrous plot holes, illogical scenes that have no set-up and no pay-off, and features not one bit of terror or interest (after you've seen the cool ape-faces, that is).  You're left wondering why they bothered to make it at all.I've read a number of reviews that tell you to lower your expectations:  &quot;If you go into it expecting something dumb, you'll have a good time.&quot;  Or, if you go into it ready to have wasted money on a bad movie, you won't feel as cheated.  Isn't that damning this thing with faint praise?  After all, it cost millions to make; at least it could've been interesting.  Instead, there's no suspense, no drama and the action sequences are muddled and confusing, especially the big fight near the end.  It's barely even a Tim Burton film.Mark Wahlberg plays the human this time, crash landing after impetuously taking off after a lost chimp-o-naut and running into a freaky time-storm in space.  As if the title isn't obvious enough, he lands on a world where talking apes dominate talking people.  For some reason (never fully developed in the film), Wahlberg becomes the heaven-born savior for the raggedy, unappreciated human-folk, represented by Estella Warren (shades of Nova!) and Kris Kristofferson, who does absolutely nothing.  And there's some punk kid who mouths off and gets in the way.  Friendly apes include Helena Bonham Carter as a warm-hearted chimp and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as a disgraced gorilla general who's now her loyal servant.Unfortuntely for everyone, a vicious chimp played by Tim Roth comes calling.  Roth's out to kill all the humans for no particular reason (I think maybe he's just a lunatic... yawn), and he's aided by his giant lieutenant, a gorilla played sensitively (I'm serious) by giant actor Michael Clarke Duncan.Once Wahlberg and company escape Ape City, the story devolves into a sub-&quot;Braveheart,&quot; with hordes of people appearing out of nowhere to follow Wahlberg in a revolution he never promised.  But plot holes undermine their revolution's momentum.  Roth finds out Wahlberg's from another planet, but it doesn't figure into either the story, or his hatred for the astronaut.  Really, no one seems suprised, or even to care.  Then there's a Carter/Wahlberg/Warren/Roth love rectangle that goes nowhere, especially since Warren has little to do except look hot in leather skins.  Which she does.  Oh yes, she does indeed.I won't compare it to the original.  No deep philosophical or theological arguments or themes here.  You will find a few good performances.  Roth is especially chimp-like, and Glenn Shadix (Otho in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;) has a few brief scenes as an orangutan senator.

I looked at this as its own movie and did not think of it as a remake.Also, unlike many reviewers, I had no problem with the fact that the humans talked yet were still oppressed and not fighting back. The majority of humans in the history of our planet have been oppressed and afraid to fight back. American culture and freedom is not the historical norm.That said, I was not thrilled with the overall plot of the movie, nor the quality of the acting, though the special effects were pretty good, IMHO. The theme, however, that struck me as most rememorable in this movie, and caused me to drop an otherwise 3 to a 1 (or less), is the one in which the deeply rooted beliefs that the apes held are so easily stripped away. As our ""hero"" encourages the friendly girl ape to come with him to see something amasing that will change her world (forgive my not remembering their names), it is portrayed in a manner that what he is doing is good and noble and something we should all be grateful for, even though what he is showing her is intended to bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down. Then there's the second-in-command ape who is very devoted to their ape religion, yet the moment he enters the spaceship, he instantly comes to believe that everything he had previously held sacred is a lie - just like that. I couldn't help feel as if the movie were trying to say to the audience, ""Hey, haven't you heard of that guy Darwin? Yeah? Then why do you still believe in that silly God person of yours?""This movie, I believe did try to touch an issue of the day, secularism verus religion.

Mark Whalberg does many roles well but doesn't quite manage to pull off action hero. Tim Roth was excellent, however; a pure racist/elitist who stops at nothing to achieve his goals. Other supporting characters were interesting, alas only those in ape makeup. It's true you really don't sympathize with the humans all that much which is disappointing. The psuedo-romance between the lead human and the sexy monkey would have been interesting to explore if done well.As for the ending (which I know is still causing agita) let me say this; I was unhappy with it becuause it had the potential to be something new and wonderfully strange, if it were explained a little better. If even hints as to why the events shown had come to pass had been given it would have satisifed. But alas, unless Mr. Burton agrees to film a sequel that expands on it we will never know what he had in mind.

HAAA!! I agree with everybody's criticism of Mark Wahlberg as Leo Davidson, he is woefully miscast and certainly seemed uncomfortable tryng to carry this film as lead man. I never cared for his character one bit, and he seemed to have great difficulty emoting or relaying the shock someone would have crash-landing onto a planet of ticked-off TALKING APES!!! Nevertheless, there are some good performances in this film--both Paul Giamatti and Michael Clarke Duncan give great performance as apes(actually Giamatti's character, Limbo, is an orangutan). The film itself is basically a two-hour morality play telling you that humans have mistreated animals, slaves, Indians and whoever else you want to throw in there. To me, it got kind of tiresome after the first thirty minutes. Tim Burton does a decent job directing this movie--not one of his more memorable outings.  He certainly wasn't helped by the fact that the screenplay is pretty bad: all the characters are very one-dimensional and the dialogue is somewhat flat. In retrospect, he probably shouldn't have taken this project on, but I'm sure he thought it would turn out to be something special instead of a movie that was almost instantly forgotten two weeks after it was released. Two big positives were the makeup (the apes looked absolutely fantastic), and some of the locations were breathtakingly beautiful. But that's not enough to make this more than an average to below-average film.DVD: The extras on this disc are infinitely more interesting than the film itself! Especially good was 'Ape School' which the actors had to through to learn how to walk and act like an ape. Also, to watch the actors go through the three hours of makeup was interesting, and it certainly didn't look too comfortable. Another interesting feature was the multi-angled scenes, where you get to see Tim Burton working with the actors to try and get a scene shot, and there is also an option to change camera angles yourself.

One of those movies was the revolutionary re-envisioning of the sci-fi classic ""The Planet of the Apes"".  Tim Burton was given the greenlight by Warner Brothers to helm this imaginative new look at a world ruled by primates, and where humans are the animals.  With a dynamite cast of Hollywood's A-list, such as; Mark Wahlberg, Michael Clarke Duncan, Tim Roth, and hottie of the moment Estella Warren, this movie looked to have blockbuster success with sequel potential written all over it.  And as predicted the movie did tremendous numbers at the box office, and true to form the ending of the movie was much like that of the original, being open-ended to leave plenty of room for a sequel.  Sadly, Warner Brothers and Tim Burton had some behind-the-scenes problems that would appear to have destroyed all hope for a sequel, leaving audiences with an entertaining action blockbuster that in essence, never satisfactorily ends.The story for ""The Planet of the Apes"" is as follows, in the future, the year 2029 to be exact, an astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) unfortunately crashes his experimental shuttle on a strange new planet.  The strange part about this planet is the fact that humans are being hunted by talking apes.  To survive and hopefully figure a way off this backwards planet, he must evade the ape army led by General Thade (Tim Roth), and reach a mysterious temple that holds the key to the mystery surrounding the human race's survival on this planet.As I said before, due to the falling out director Tim Burton (""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"") had with Warner Brothers over the film's gigantic budget and storyline, it is highly unlikely that we will ever see the conclusion to this engaging re-imagining of the sci-fi classic.  The sad thing is the movie did well with audiences, and Mark Wahlberg and Tim Burton both expressed interest in returning to the reinvigorated franchise, but neither wish to work with Warner Brothers on the project again, because the only way to do a sequel to a movie so large, is to top it and that will require even more money and I doubt Warner Brothers wants to give that money away.  Especially not with two classic franchises of their's seeing new life on the big screen with 2005's ""Batman Begins"" and 2006's ""Superman Returns"", not to mention the expensive mutant adventures of Marvel's ""X-Men"" that is currently filming the second sequel in the popular franchise with ""X3"".""The Planet of the Apes"" was an entertaining film, and a very good remake, that was well-acted, and featured terrific special effects and make-up effects work.  Sadly, even though the film made it's money back and continues to sell decently on DVD, the story will more than likely remain unfinished, leaving at least me, greatly disappointed and causing this movie to lose some points in it's effectiveness as a movie.""The Planet of the Apes"" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and brief sensuality.",4,"Entertaining Remake, Sequel Please...",1127088000,"09 19, 2005",2005,3052,"['2001', 'were', 'numerous', 'movies', 'onslaught', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'audiences', 'were', 'waiting', 'anxiously', 'see', 'One', 'movies', 'was', 'revolutionary', 're-envisioning', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'given', 'greenlight', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'helm', 'imaginative', 'new', 'look', 'world', 'ruled', 'primates', 'where', 'humans', 'are', 'animals', 'dynamite', 'cast', 'Hollywood', 'A-list', 'such', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'hottie', 'moment', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'movie', 'looked', 'have', 'blockbuster', 'success', 'sequel', 'potential', 'written', 'predicted', 'movie', 'did', 'tremendous', 'numbers', 'box', 'office', 'true', 'form', 'ending', 'movie', 'was', 'much', 'original', 'being', 'open-ended', 'leave', 'plenty', 'room', 'sequel', 'Sadly', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'had', 'behind-the-scenes', 'problems', 'would', 'appear', 'have', 'destroyed', 'hope', 'sequel', 'leaving', 'audiences', 'entertaining', 'action', 'blockbuster', 'essence', 'never', 'satisfactorily', 'ends.The', 'story', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'as', 'future', 'year', '2029', 'be', 'exact', 'astronaut', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'unfortunately', 'experimental', 'shuttle', 'strange', 'new', 'planet', 'strange', 'part', 'planet', 'fact', 'humans', 'are', 'being', 'hunted', 'talking', 'apes', 'survive', 'hopefully', 'figure', 'way', 'backwards', 'planet', 'must', 'evade', 'ape', 'army', 'led', 'General', 'Thade', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'reach', 'mysterious', 'temple', 'key', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'human', 'race', 'survival', 'planet.As', 'said', 'due', 'falling', 'out', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'Returns', 'had', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'film', 'gigantic', 'budget', 'storyline', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'conclusion', 'engaging', 're-imagining', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'sad', 'thing', 'movie', 'did', 'well', 'audiences', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'expressed', 'interest', 'returning', 'reinvigorated', 'franchise', 'wish', 'work', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'project', 'again', 'only', 'way', 'do', 'sequel', 'movie', 'so', 'large', 'top', 'will', 'require', 'even', 'more', 'money', 'doubt', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'give', 'money', 'away', 'Especially', 'not', 'two', 'classic', 'franchises', 'seeing', 'new', 'life', 'big', 'screen', '2005', 'Batman', 'Begins', '2006', 'Superman', 'Returns', 'not', 'mention', 'expensive', 'mutant', 'adventures', 'Marvel', 'X-Men', 'currently', 'filming', 'second', 'sequel', 'popular', 'franchise', 'X3', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'entertaining', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'remake', 'was', 'well-acted', 'featured', 'terrific', 'special', 'effects', 'make-up', 'effects', 'work', 'Sadly', 'even', 'film', 'made', 'money', 'back', 'sell', 'decently', 'DVD', 'story', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'remain', 'unfinished', 'leaving', 'least', 'greatly', 'disappointed', 'causing', 'movie', 'lose', 'points', 'effectiveness', 'movie', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'sensuality']",N/A

From a purely visual perspective (!) it struck me as having pretty high production values.My only criticism, in this department, is that the actors, for all their alleged in-depth training, never come across as anything but human beings in *very* clever makeup.  No-one managed to maintain even the basic simian crouch throughout the film, and most of the actors (stars and extras alike) didn't even seem to be trying.Of course the story was always meant as a metaphor rather than a genuine alternate reality, but even a metaphor works best when there is at least a veneer of realism.If, on the other hand, you like your films to have at least a smidgeon of intelligence then you can scratch this new version of ""Planet of the Apes"" from your viewing list straight away.This is a film that is almost over-run with *latent* characters and *latent* themes and subplots - but none of them are ever allowed to amount to anything.  They arise, and are left dangling in the wind.

The original Planet of the Apes was definitely a classic, but what Hollywood can do with special effects today is amazing. Although the writers wrote the movie very well, Tim Burton, a wacko in my opinion, ruined the movie with his strange ideas. The film is spectacular until it comes time for Mark Wahlberg to return home. The ending is a complete disater, because Tim Burton thought that it makes sense to himself for everything to be reversed; Apes have taken the place of humans. If one knows any concept about the theories of time travel then one would know why the ending is totally inaccurate. First, Mark Wahlberg goes back in time (at least 400+ years), which makes sense for now. Then he returns home via the electromagnetic storm through a wormhole back to Earth to the time he had departed from. Now everything is reversed. In order to change events or make a &quot;ripple&quot; in time, one must travel before the date one wishes to change; not after.

Corn ""reviewer""","[2, 4]","Maybe it was just us (but I don't think so judging from the reactions of other viewers in the theater) but this one came so close to being really good - and then fell flat, flat, flat. My husband and I were left good by the plot (what plot there was) and found the humans (the ones who weren't in the ape makeup and costumes) to be characters withouth great depth or dimension. Also, there is tension and unspoken rivalry between Helena Bonham Carter as an ape and a blonde-haired girl who is smitten with Mark Wahlberg's character.That plot line went nowhere and there was a big build-up but no fireworks.  Wahlberg, an actor we've enjoyed before in other movies, is strangely lifeless, almost flat in his delivery and timing througout. But then maybe he didn't have a great script to work with.

540996,A1UCTRG2VXERR4,B00003CXXU,Keith Renn,"[3, 3]","Yesterday I twice watched Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes -- first w/o Tim's commentary, and second with it. Overall, I'll give the movie 3-of-5 stars -- breaking it into three basic areas: 1) makeup and special effects, 2) acting, 3) story or screenplay. The makeup was great!! FXs used for apes leaping and jumping were really good, while other FXs were OK (the space ships and magnetic storm seemed a bit cheesy.) The performance of Tim Roth was remarkable -- the best aspect of the entire movie. Helena Bonham Carter and Paul Giamatti were also excellent, with several other fine performances by the supporting cast -- including a stellar death scene by Charlton Heston (the best scene in the entire film -- IMHO.) In all, the acting (including their mannerisms and posturing) and makeup of the apes carries this movie -- which brings me to the (GULP!@^%#) screenplay.How can such a Colossal movie screw-up a story line that has such great potential, wherein it alternates from &quot;YES!!&quot; to &quot;WHAT THE ****!!!???&quot; The story has so many shortcomings that could easily have been corrected, that left as they were weakened the overall effect. For instance: 1) How did the apes EVOLVE (no explanation is provided) in the course of about 900 years (according to the &quot;date meter&quot;); 2) If the humans -- as made clear in the movie by Heston -- were far more inventive than the apes, then why weren't they able to devise a means of defending themselves or achieving dominance (where were the bows and arrows -- AT LEAST!!); 3) How does a young and vivacious human woman -- constantly hunted and harried along with the rest of her species -- manage to keep her lipstick from smearing??; and 4) (the cheapest trick of all) Why, near the end of the movie, when Mark Wahlberg goes BACK in time (the &quot;date meter&quot; reverses), does he arrive at an EARTH (not the Ape Planet) where General Thade became that planet's Abe Lincoln!!?? Interestingly, in his DVD commentary, Burton says he's not really into analyzing or interpreting this story, as he's more concerned with the overall effect or emotional impact of his films. This sounds like a weak excuse for not focusing on probably the most important element of any movie -- the story (but, in fairness to Tim, perhaps he had limited control over this component.) Just compare this screenplay to that of the Matrix -- which I thought scored about 98-of-100 in this department, as opposed to maybe a 65 for POTA.How could the story have been improved?? 1) No live apes should have been used. The pre-timewarp apes should have been &quot;genetically enhanced&quot; slaves and lab &quot;animals&quot; -- having human-like intelligence in bodies identical to those later encountered. This more sinister story-line would have provided a motive for ape &quot;revenge&quot; and dismissed the evolution question; 2) With human-like intelligence yet far superior physical prowess, it would be reasonable that the apes could come to dominate their previous masters in a low-tech world; 3) The human-female &quot;love-interest&quot; role played by Estellas Warren should not have existed in the movie -- replaced by a more profound and interesting relationship between Wahlberg's human and Carter's ape. As it stood, Carter loved Wahlberg, but he thought of her as a chimpanzee -- so much for &quot;equality&quot; on the part of our hero in this film; 4) Replace the cheesy (and predictable, actually) ending with something more thought provoking and substantial -- like maybe Mark deciding to stay, realizing that if he returns perhaps all of this planets ape and human inhabitants (decendants of those onboard the original spacecraft) might just fail to continue existing if he returns and changes his and their ancestors' history. (Although I'm sure something more exciting than this could have been devised.)Finally, an enjoyable movie that missed the mark, owing to a mediocre story. So much lost potential... as it easily could have been a great movie.

Let me get right to the point.The Original:  Heston plays a cynic whose eyes are perfect through which to view the Ape's world.  His splendid outbursts reflects the audience's outrage at a world(our own) seemingly gone mad.  The Remake:  Wahlburg plays a generic action/adventure hero who reacts to his situation with all the emotion of someone who missed the ""blue-light"" special at Wal-mart.The Original:  Features a bizarre but convincing Ape City built to scale.  The Remake:  Claustrophobic Ape City looks like a bad set from the old ""Buck Rogers"" TV show. Obvious CGI shots.The Original:  Constant social commentary through-out as we view our own hollow social conventions, reliance on uninformed scientific conclusions, and unfounded notions of supremacy based on religious conceit.  A plot as nihilistic as the theme.  The Remake:  More Hollywood political commentary about why guns are so evil that - stranded on a hostile world with pursuing hostile creatures - we are better off getting rid of any we have(!).  A plot that ""cleverly"" tries to wrap up centuries of story set-up with a trite, time-loop cause and resolution.The Original:  Moody directing with an epic feel topped off with a final scene that truly shocked audiences of the time.  The Remake:  Typical ""summer-blockbuster"" style direction with a finale that attempts to blend the ending of the original with the ending in the novel, and only serves to confuse the audience.Now, if you are truly a POTA fan, then you will watch this regardless (I would, and did).  Just don't expect to like it very much.  The emphasis is clearly on the sci-fi story rather than what made the original great, and the sad part is, this movie had an excellent cast that delivered excellent performances;  the story just didn't allow most of them to shine.  I say ""most"" because there is one reason to watch this:  Tim Roth as General Ursus.  His make-up as a chimp is absolutely phenomenal, for one, but his ability to emote through it and create a distinctive and convincing personality is just as astonishing.  This movie is worth one viewing for that alone.  If you are unfamiliar with the franchise, the only one you need to see is the original, as this one will give you the wrong impression that it is yet another shallow sci-fi potboiler.

541002,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00003CXXU,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[1, 1]","I've seen the original ""Planet of the Apes"" and most of its horrid sequels, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed Tim Burton's re-imagined vision of Simian supremacy.  Mark Wahlberg is perfectly cast as our shining hero of homo sapiens.  Helena Bonham Carter seems to be enjoying herself running around in chimp makeup.  Paul Giamatti plays a rather cowardly slavetrader and who can forget Michael Clarke Duncan demanding that everyone, ""Bow your head!""  Tim Roth plays Thade in a rather sinister style.  Charlton Heston takes a nod in a brief appearance as Thade's ailing father.The basic plotline is the same.  A human mysteriously ends up on an Earth ruled by chimps and gorillas.  They have mastered reading, writing and have a pretty good handle on 'rithmetic.  However, there is a constant ""threat"" from humans that needs to be suppressed that keeps them from enjoying a rather easy life. Wahlberg has to find a way back home before the apes catch up to him and take him as a slave.There's a little political commentary bantered around underneath the primary primate's plot.  There's also backstabbing, a little religion, and plenty of action to boot.  All of the special effects are done rather well, and Burton utilizes the actions and habits of real chimps to progress the film along.  Granted, when one ape in particular comes into the bedroom scantily clad for an evening of lovin', things get quite silly.  But I believe that this is the entire point of Burton's vision here.  He takes a flick that was pretty silly to begin with and treats it with a little more seriousness than some might expect.

Starting out like traditional sci fi film (albeit with Mark Wahlberg- what's he doing here?), Planet of the Apes is a very different plot from the first one, and one with lots of spectacle and action, but not so much substance.The plot of the film is very action-orientated and made me want for more background story. Sure, the action set pieces are great, but to have more on how the rouge humans came to the planet ruled by apes would have been appreciated. But like many action films recently the action and SFX make up for the usual lack of a meaty story (or script for that matter).However, Burton's visionary flair does not disappoint, in that sense the film is fantastic, as is Tim Roth as General Thade, leader of the army of apes, and the imposing Michael Clarke Duncan as one of the commanders of the army. The only stink of this movie actually, is the aforementioned Mark Wahlberg, who threatens to redefine the term ""wooden"".After some huge battle scenes we go to the legendary ending, which understandably confused viewers. Where the original's ending was great, this one is a real thinker, and when it was released, opinions of its climax flew over the net as fast as naked Brittneys.The DVD is great though, and makes for some awesome entertainment with great visuals.

Rick Baker's Oscar-worthy ape makeup was spectacular, again! Tim Burton's direction was quite good, some of the battle scenes and sets were well done! But next to that, there seems to be more mediocre or bad than good. One of the &quot;wrong turns&quot; was the script, penned by the same guys who wrote the script for &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot;...yeah, you get the idea... The dialogue was chliche, it didn't sink in to keep my captivated. There was a strong lack of depth to the movie that the original &quot;Apes&quot; exhibited quite nicely. Tim Burton only makes movies whose scripts he cares about, but there was some characteristics of Burton's movies that were definitely missing as far as the artistic aspects of the movie are concerned. I only picked up on several, one of them the very Burtonesque scarecrows in the Forbidden Zone.The ending wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. I wasn't too taken back.In short, Burton should stick to the formula that works where he has artistic control, but also control over the script (plot, dialogue, etc.).

541008,A36T2TEF5SKPUM,B00003CXXU,Laon,"[5, 8]","This is a better crafted film than any in the original series.  That's no great surprise: Tim Burton is one of the more interesting directors around, with an original and distinctive visual style, while the original films were turned out by hacks of varying degrees of competence.The original series is remembered for one great image, the head of the Statue of Liberty half-buried in the sand at the end of the first film.  It tells us that Charlton Heston's hero travelled not in space but in time, into Earth's post-nuclear apocalypse future: that one image transforms the film, at the last second, from routine adventure to anti-nuclear parable.  The Burton film never produces anything as startling as that, but the level of invention is higher over the film as a whole.  His technology looks great, as do his apes, and the city built by apes is an inspired creation, an organic, low-tech counterpart of Gotham City in the first two Batman films.The acting is a more complicated case.  Charlton Heston's acting, especially where he realised he was still on Earth, could be described as Shatneresque: over-the-top awful, but still compelling your attention.  In this _Planet_ Mark Wahlberg's hero is a zero: the gaze slides off Wahlberg as it might off a fire hydrant or filing cabinet, in search of something more interesting.  Actually Wahlberg is so blank and bland he probably could be upstaged by a hydrant.Other human characters are no more interesting: in fact &quot;character&quot; exaggerates the case slightly.  I don't think any human other than Wahlberg gets more than a dozen or so lines.  Most interesting is a girl in a &quot;Me Jane&quot; outfit who gets so much screentime that she must be meant as a &quot;character&quot;; the interesting thing about her is that she is never without lip gloss in a culture that should logically have lost the ability to make the stuff.  No, actually it's that she has nice legs and fine cleavage; she's there to appeal to the adolescent in me, and the adolescent is duly grateful.  Kris Kristopherson also appears in a virtually silent role; but silence suits him as an actor, and may have improved his music career.But dehumanising the &quot;human&quot; figures is part of the film's effect, emphasising the humanisation of the apes, who have real personalities, conflicts and inner lives.  They are richly characterised, some - even the bad guys - having a certain Shakespearean nobility.  Others, such as the slave trader turned fugitive, are comically alive.  Liveliest is Tim Roth's deranged fascist General Thade, out to exterminate the remnants of humanity.Which brings us to one of the film's themes.  Not the ape-jokes on the absurdity of racism, or the animal rights message, but a philosophical question: If apes got smart, really smart, what would their culture be like?Wittgenstein argued that if a lion spoke English, we still wouldn't understand it.  For example if a lion says &quot;Hello&quot; we know the word, but we don't know precisely what the lion _means_.  That is, to us gregarious apes, &quot;hello&quot; contains messages about social circle and mutual obligation.  A lion's &quot;hello&quot; might mean: &quot;I see you, fellow predator; I'm not going to kill you today, and I trust you feel the same&quot;.  Even if we know the same words, our experiences, perceptions, bodies, drives and cultures mean that each word has a slightly different meaning for us and for them.  And if words are defective for inter-species communication, we can't fix the problem by discussing it in words.The answer (not supplied by Wittgenstein) is that you must learn lion English by entering the physical culture of lions, watching and smelling their body language and hearing their sounds as they speak, until we learn &quot;Lionglish&quot; as we might learn any language by immersion.  The oddity is that once we have learned &quot;Lionglish&quot; outside observers would notice no difference.  The words we used would still be virtually the same as if we spoke English while the lion spoke Lionglish: only our understanding would have changed.Burton's film, unlike the original series, shows that speaking apes would still be apes: they would still have non-human gestures and concerns.  They use smell, for example, to test if another ape is lying, or read their emotional state.  Ape ideas of hierarchy survive, with a non-human vocabulary of gestures of submission and supplication alongside the spoken language.  Though sometimes Burton tones down the ape-ness, for example when Helena Bonham-Carter's Ari, a human-rights-activist chimpanzee, tries to buy her humans time by offering her body to the deranged humanophobe General Thade.  A female chimp should have got down on all fours to wave her brightly coloured rump at him, but (to my inner adolescent's sore disappointment) Bonham-Carter doesn't go that far.As the camera pans over Ape City we see examples of how ape physiology would affect ape culture.  For example an ape plays a harp-like instrument, but with feet as well as hands: the music that apes hear will be different because their bodies are different.  And so on.  It's not a central theme, but an interesting one, and Burton and his designers have made sure it is there, while the apes in the original series were all too plainly humans in hairy costumes.I won't give away the ending, but I will defend its logic. General Thade is left trapped and angry inside working human technology, with memory banks showing vital historical information. He has an energy source, and he knows the whereabouts of a space ship and a &quot;time warp&quot; in nearby space.  It's clear from that not only what happened at the end of the film, but how and why.  The end is not a complete surprise, but a logical outcome of the information we - and Thade - have been given._Planet_ is lots of fun, has great music, and it moves along quickly.

541009,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00003CXXU,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This remake of the 1968 blockbuster is an entirely different movie. If the viewer expects it to follow the original, the viewer will, undoubtedly, be disappointed. While the storyline is basically the same in that simians have enslaved humans, it has decidely different twists.First and foremost, Rick Baker's ape make-up surpasses that of the 1968 version. It is unbelievably good, almost remarkable. The make-up, coupled with the simian specific behavioral nuances, and the final filip brought to the simian characters by the actors themselves, brings the simian characters to life, making them very three dimensional.The storyline is fairly simple. A Major Davidson, while traveling in a spaceship, attempts to rescue a space pod containing one of his favorite chimpanzees and finds himself caught up in an electro-magnetic disturbance. This storm causes him to crash land on a planet, where simians are the dominant species, and humans are their slaves. No sooner than he lands, he finds himself enslaved and enbroiled in survival.He discovers that there are two opposing camps of thought amongst the simians on the issue of humans. One school of thought, favored by Ari (Helen Bonham- Carter), favors equality, while the other, espoused by the sinister General Thade, urges extermination. There is also a romantic sub-plot between these two protagonists.What happens to them all provides much food for thought. Wahlberg is somewhat wooden in his portrayal of Davidson, which is somewhat surprising, as he is usually a pretty competent actor. Tim Roth is absolutely terrific as the single minded and ruthless General Thade. While Helen Bonham-Carter is good as the liberal simian, it is Paul Giammatti who very nearly steals the show as Limbo, the slave trader. Look for Charlton Heston in the role of General Thade's dying father.

The original has a much more powerful revealing ending.Basically it is the same story, but the action and story focuses on the changing of history and alternate time-lines. They borrowed all of these concepts from Star Trek. There was a lot of originality here except a few performances.The DVD extras are the best I have seems which made this movie redeem itself on DVD.

And, knowing that it is in Burton's habits to put spectacular and beautiful yet dark and mysterious images on film, I expected a &quot;Planet of The Apes&quot; with the same story than the original, but with a different perspective in the images. But I was somehow disappointed to see that, sure the images were nice, though not as amazing as &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;' or &quot;Batman&quot;'s, but the script seemed to have forgotten. The film lasts two hours, but you don't see them pass away, because you feel like nothing happens in the film, but everything is happening at the same time. The movie could be separated in like three chapters; The beginning, the core and the ending. That's it, no surprises, nothing special, except the images and Tim Roth's acting. This film wasted lots of potential interesting performances *Spoilers warning*(Kris Kristofferson doesn't even play a role, he only runs and die, and Helena Bonham Carter has a very hollow and empty role as an ape who has more feelings, and her feelings are so hard to see because of the limited facial expression due to the make up). Plus, they put Estella Warren wearing some kind of leaves made bikini, isn't that superficial and commercial? This is the first Tim Burton film that deceives me, and I hope it's the last one. This is a very good example of a movie which has special and make up effects as a structure. many people won't realize it, because they'll be fascinated by the images, but this blind attitude is exactly what the makers expected. Planet of The Apes is more a (commercial) vision of The Planet of The Apes by Tim Burton. It is not so identic to the original, I couldn't say it's a remake.

After watching his remake of PLANET OF THE APES, all I can say to Mr. Burton is take a bath, get a haircut, and drop the brooding genius pretense. There is nothing brilliant, artistic, or even mildly above average about this film. Think ""Stargate Meets Planet of the Apes."" And even a horrible film like Stargate had an ending we could understand.But, then, maybe that's Mr. Burton's game. Present an ending that even Socrates couldn't unravel. There! That's the proof of his brilliance. Only he of old man sunglasses and dirty hair is capable of understanding this ""twist."" Sorry, though, I don't buy it.The ending of this film is so bizarre and so stupid that it defies belief. But it is worth dissecting it if for no other reason that to project what the sequel might be. (Oh, there will be a sequel. The ending begs for one. ""Please, give me chance to explain this shocking non-sequitur!"") Here are my best guesses for the sequel:(1) It was all a dream. Marky Mark is a zookeeper who wakes up from this nightmare, frees all of his chimps, and falls in love with a particularly attractive Orang. (She'll be animatronic in the film--with perky, human-like breasts, perhaps.)(2) Marky Mark entered a parallel universe in which an ape version of Tim Burton is making Planet of the Humans. Mark is recruited to star in the movie and is ultimately placed in a zoological park for retired animal actors.(3) Marky Mark was driven insane by his experience with apes and now sees all humans as Apes, including his mother--which leads to some dramatic incidents involving bananas.",1,Awful.

Or maybe they just thought it was hard to spot the &quot;Burton&quot; character this time around. Perhaps this review can shed some light on the matter for those people out there who so desperately want to love/hate this film without first thinking about what it is. Here's my 2 cents. Please hear me out. Leo isn't supposed to be deep or interesting. He is flat and cold not because Mark walberg is a bad actor, but because Leo is a soldier. He is only there to get the hell away from there. He doesn't care how the apes got that way, it doesn't matter. He doesn't think like Taylor in the original, he simply tries to survive. That's why he isn't gladiator or Mel Gibson. He doesn't care about the people he &quot;just happens to help&quot; on his way out of this place. That's also why &lt;MAJOR SPOILER&gt; he doesn't deserve a happy ending. I mean he gets the girl with the looks(and the chimp-girl with the brains) he even finds his lost monkey and reunites apes and humans in peace. And yet he leaves them all just to go home. He doesn't deserve to be a hero, and he isn't a sympathetic character so Burton decided to play a little joke on him in the end and give him a nice surprise when he finally reaches Earth. And as for the &quot;Burton&quot; character, well, granted there is no Edward Siscorhands, Ed Wood or Ichabod in this one. There is however a combination of Thade and Ari. They both stand out in society (like most Burton misfits) and they are both morally strong about their ideas. That's why Burton lets Thade kind of win in the end. And Ari gets a happy endning and also gets to tell people about the human who fell from the sky and therefore became a legend and a myth. Or fairytale if you will. POTA is not a fairytale but more like &quot;the making of a fairytale&quot;. And like most of burtons movies it's also more than that. There's film magic at work when we see Charlton Heston. And both Tim roth and Paul Giamatti RULE!! I love this film both as a Tim Burton fan, a sci-fi fan and a fan of film in general. People should lighten up, and realize, that in any other director's hands this movie would have failed miserably OR be a mainstream action movie. In the hands of Burton it becomes neither.

541028,A2NGF128HTRD39,B00003CXXU,Matt,"[3, 7]","Tim Burton's reenvision of the '68 cult classic is nicely done, in one state of mind, that is. What can I say? I was impressed throughout the trip in certain perspectives. It has incredible visuals, awesome make-up and costumes, eccentric and dignified plot to keep it going, and so-so performances that make it work. Mark Wahlberg isn't my first choice, but oh well. I realize I'm not reviewing this movie as a critical viewer would be reviewing this film, but I can't justify this picture anymore than I have. It has some new twists, it has brief humor, it packs adventure, it strives for that emotional feel, and that shocking tingle witnessing the amidst and vulagarious apes. I can describe it simple, or textured. Personally, the film isn't serious enough to be reviewed seriously and critically. Fun is this film, but jagged and simple this film is. It feels creative, and it has a powerful image. But what it doesn't have is the poise and posture you're looking for. Sleepy Hollow was original because it was in context of historical thrillers, and had the feel of a Hitchcock classic. Batman was striking because it rocked the screen and had an artistic and creative, dark and gloomy feel to it. It packed action, adventure, and brilliant actors. Edward Scissorhands had audiences in awe with its emotional value, however goofy and obscure it was. This film is just ""adventure"", a remake/reenvision. It is new, it is bold, it is fun, it has adventure, but it isn't a heroic film that saves other films and rises above the average action film.""Talking monkeys can't exist."" This is an astronaut/scientist talking. Wouldn't he say something a little more crisp and sustained? The line is simple and plain, just like most of the dialogue. It works, and it goes on to a ""Mummy Returns"" battle, but it just isn't Tim Burton. Burton goes beyond the reaches of the mind and pulls his audiences into a new world. This film doesn't capture any dramatic aspect. It says- THE APES RULE. HUMANS DON'T. LET'S FIGHT.I wanted something more. To top it off, the film's ending is good, but sadly terrible at the same time. It is more bad than good (in plain english). I liked the idea of it, but it is inexplainable, and it makes absolutely no sense with the film. I wanted to understand why. This film can't have a sequel; it is just one of those films that doesn't go on.I do not use a ""3"" star rating when reviewing movies on this site, because it is a good-bad combination that is really wishy-washy, as if you can't make up your mind whether it's good or bad. I didn't like this film for the most part even though it was fun.  It just isn't what you want it to be. It is just a floater, nothing that spurs from the water. So I'll go ahead and give it two stars. I could watch it again, but I wish the filmmakers would've went for another Burton classic, rather than a new millenium whiplash adventurer that only has ""average"" to fall back on.QUOTE: ""However creative this film may be, it is not a sincere masterpiece. It completely overlooks the point of a Tim Burton film. Everything is average and simple, topped off with a very questionable and ruining ending. It was fun, it was adventrous, and it was briefly thought-provoking, but it didn't go anywhere above the new millenium adventure film that looks at ""average"". I was entertained, and I was visually impressed with the movie, but it isn't something Burton should've attacked.

541029,A2B6VI9MQI0WKI,B00003CXXU,Matthew Gladney,"[1, 3]","First, let me state that I have *not* seen the original 1968 'Planet of the Apes' film, so I am judging this 2001 release on its own merits - no comparisons. As a summer-time, sci-fi action movie, the film does o.k., but it really falters in dialogue, acting, and (dare I say it) direction.Mark Walhberg, who is quite a capable actor, is *very* flat as an astronaut named Davidson, who is working closely with monkeys on a space station in the year 2029. The opening scenes on board the space station are unintentionally funny, as the lines are pretty bad, and the acting worse. When a weird sort of vortex opens up near the station, a chimp is sent to investigate. It gets into trouble, and so Davidson valiantly goes to its rescue. He gets caught in a rift in the vortex, is shot forward 4,000 years, and crash lands onto a planet mostly populated by highly intelligent, verbal, quasi-civilized apes. They hunt down humans, who are no better than slaves to them, and Davidson is soon caught and put in a sort of prison.Helena Bonham-Carter plays Ari, an ape sympathetic to the humans, and as her father is a powerful senator, she can get away with her outward acceptance of mankind. Tim Roth plays an evil general, Thade, who is hell-bent on wiping out the humans, and Michael Clarke Duncan is his *very* loyal sidekick, Attar. Davidson soon escapes, with the help of Ari, and many other humans blindly follow them. Thade and Attar are in hot pursuit.The visuals for the film are well-done. The Ape City (or whatever it's called) is a nice set-piece, and the apes themselves are wonderfully rendered by make-up artist Rick Baker. Many of the scenes of the apes chasing the humans are somewhat scary, and the settings used evoke a good sense of atmosphere. The actors confined in the ape suits do a nice job with their roles.Unfortunately, those are the only good points to the movie.Where 'Planet of the Apes 2001' fails is mainly in the plot/writing, and *somewhat* in the direction. The Davidson character isn't really a very sympathetic hero - in fact, he can't really be called a hero at all. In the first scenes on the space station, he isn't exactly glowing with warmth for the monkeys. One character even notes that he tries to tease them too much. But then, when the monkey sent out to investigate the vortex falls into danger, Davidson RISKS HIS LIFE to go save it. Huh?  Then, when he crash lands on the planet of the apes, he is *totally* concerned with getting *himself* free and off the planet, *not* with the plight of the other humans - this, after he risked his life to save a monkey. The other humans simply seem to have invited themselves along with his escape. Of course, during the climactic battle, he stands with everyone, but that is more out of necessity than anything else.The writing in certain spots (mostly the scenes involving humans) is pretty bland. Some of the lines are actually kind of embarrasingly simple. I know this is a summer movie, but it manages to fall short, even in *that* genre. Tim Burton's directing is pretty even-handed, except that the part of the film which falls between Davidson and the human's escape from Ape City, and the final climactic battle seems to drag-on too long. It gets really slow, and could have been tightened up a bit.There are also problems with the apes themselves. For one, it is revealed (after the audience has probably already guessed it) that the apes are descended from the monkeys on Davidson's space station. Now, I'm no evolution major, but *that* kind of advancement CAN NOT happen over the course of the 4,000 year time frame which is laid down to us. And another thing: Attar (the loyal ape to Thade) is *very* religious. At the first inkling that his religion might have some holes in it, he is quicker to abandon it than a rat on a sinking ship. That kind of faith shattering just does not happen (believably, anyway) that quickly.And, finally, we come to the &quot;shocking ending&quot;, which, from what I gather, many people find suitable. I did not. Gosh darn it, I've tried, but I just can't see how it works into ANY part of the rest of the movie. It makes NO SENSE whatsoever, except to serve as a &quot;shocking ending&quot;, and a possible lead-in to a sequel.Well, there you have it. Maybe the whole point of this movie went over my head. Maybe I missed things. Maybe I over-analyzed it. Or maybe, just maybe, it was a bad movie with a few good spots to make it watchable. Maybe.",2,"Good Points, But Too Many Bad Ones To Save It",996192000,"07 27, 2001",2001,4478,"['First', 'let', 'state', 'have', '*not*', 'seen', 'original', '1968', ""'Planet"", 'Apes', 'film', 'am', 'judging', '2001', 'release', 'own', 'merits', 'comparisons', 'summer-time', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'movie', 'film', 'o.k.', 'really', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'dare', 'say', 'direction.Mark', 'Walhberg', 'who', 'quite', 'capable', 'actor', '*very*', 'flat', 'astronaut', 'named', 'Davidson', 'who', 'working', 'closely', 'monkeys', 'space', 'station', 'year', '2029', 'opening', 'scenes', 'board', 'space', 'station', 'are', 'unintentionally', 'funny', 'lines', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'acting', 'worse', 'When', 'weird', 'sort', 'vortex', 'up', 'station', 'chimp', 'sent', 'investigate', 'trouble', 'so', 'Davidson', 'valiantly', 'rescue', 'caught', 'rift', 'vortex', 'shot', 'forward', '4,000', 'years', 'crash', 'lands', 'planet', 'mostly', 'populated', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'verbal', 'quasi-civilized', 'apes', 'hunt', 'down', 'humans', 'who', 'are', 'better', 'slaves', 'Davidson', 'soon', 'caught', 'put', 'sort', 'prison.Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'plays', 'Ari', 'ape', 'sympathetic', 'humans', 'father', 'powerful', 'senator', 'can', 'get', 'away', 'outward', 'acceptance', 'mankind', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'evil', 'general', 'Thade', 'who', 'hell-bent', 'wiping', 'out', 'humans', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', '*very*', 'loyal', 'sidekick', 'Attar', 'Davidson', 'soon', 'help', 'Ari', 'many', 'other', 'humans', 'blindly', 'follow', 'Thade', 'Attar', 'are', 'hot', 'pursuit.The', 'visuals', 'film', 'are', 'well-done', 'Ape', 'City', 'whatever', 'called', 'nice', 'set-piece', 'apes', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'rendered', 'make-up', 'artist', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'Many', 'scenes', 'apes', 'chasing', 'humans', 'are', 'somewhat', 'scary', 'settings', 'used', 'evoke', 'good', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'actors', 'confined', 'ape', 'suits', 'do', 'nice', 'job', 'roles.Unfortunately', 'are', 'only', 'good', 'points', 'movie.Where', ""'Planet"", 'Apes', '2001', 'fails', 'mainly', 'plot/writing', '*somewhat*', 'direction', 'Davidson', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'hero', 'fact', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'be', 'called', 'hero', 'first', 'scenes', 'space', 'station', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'glowing', 'warmth', 'monkeys', 'One', 'character', 'even', 'tease', 'too', 'much', 'then', 'when', 'monkey', 'sent', 'out', 'investigate', 'vortex', 'danger', 'Davidson', 'RISKS', 'HIS', 'LIFE', 'go', 'save', 'Huh', 'Then', 'when', 'lands', 'planet', 'apes', '*totally*', 'concerned', 'getting', '*himself*', 'free', 'planet', '*not*', 'plight', 'other', 'humans', 'risked', 'life', 'save', 'monkey', 'other', 'humans', 'simply', 'seem', 'have', 'invited', 'escape', 'course', 'climactic', 'battle', 'everyone', 'more', 'necessity', 'anything', 'else.The', 'writing', 'certain', 'spots', 'mostly', 'scenes', 'involving', 'humans', 'pretty', 'bland', 'lines', 'are', 'actually', 'kind', 'embarrasingly', 'simple', 'know', 'summer', 'movie', 'fall', 'short', 'even', '*that*', 'genre', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'directing', 'pretty', 'even-handed', 'part', 'film', 'Davidson', 'human', 'escape', 'Ape', 'City', 'final', 'climactic', 'battle', 'drag-on', 'too', 'long', 'really', 'slow', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'up', 'bit.There', 'are', 'also', 'problems', 'apes', 'one', 'revealed', 'audience', 'probably', 'already', 'guessed', 'apes', 'are', 'descended', 'monkeys', 'Davidson', 'space', 'station', 'Now', ""'m"", 'evolution', 'major', '*that*', 'kind', 'advancement', 'CAN', 'NOT', 'happen', 'course', '4,000', 'year', 'time', 'frame', 'laid', 'down', 'thing', 'Attar', 'loyal', 'ape', 'Thade', '*very*', 'religious', 'first', 'inkling', 'religion', 'might', 'have', 'holes', 'quicker', 'abandon', 'rat', 'sinking', 'ship', 'kind', 'faith', 'shattering', 'just', 'not', 'happen', 'believably', 'anyway', 'quickly.And', 'finally', 'come', 'quot', 'shocking', 'ending', 'quot', 'what', 'gather', 'many', 'people', 'find', 'suitable', 'did', 'not', 'Gosh', 'darn', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'ANY', 'part', 'rest', 'movie', 'SENSE', 'whatsoever', 'serve', 'quot', 'shocking', 'ending', 'quot', 'possible', 'lead-in', 'sequel.Well', 'have', 'Maybe', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'went', 'head', 'Maybe', 'missed', 'things', 'Maybe', 'over-analyzed', 'maybe', 'just', 'maybe', 'was', 'bad', 'movie', 'few', 'good', 'spots', 'make', 'watchable', 'Maybe']",N/A
541030,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00003CXXU,Matthew Horner,"[0, 1]","There are, of course, problems associated with being a movie geek like me. One is the tendency to get neurotically attached to the work of favorite actors and directors, to become emotionally involved with their work. They become like family, and there is nothing more irritating than a family member disappointing one.Director Tim Burton [Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow] is one of my favorites. His new, 'reimagined' version of Planet of the Apes is weak. So, I wasn't merely disappointed, I was angry. How could Tim do this to me? What was he thinking? Why would anyone so imaginative even think of redoing a classic? How could he bring shame to the 'family'? Yet, what difference can my feelings make? Burton doesn't know me from Adam.In this version of Planet of the Apes, Capt. Leo Davidson [Mark Wahlberg] is part of a space mission that is studying the effectiveness of training primates to pilot small space craft. [Don't ask.] When one of the chimps gets lost in a freak magnetic storm, Davidson goes after him. He, too, gets lost and winds up on a planet where apes rule and human beings are the lesser species. He does battle with the apes. Aided by Ari [Helena Bonham-Carter], a kind ape and sort of an animal rights activist in reverse, he escapes, along with a band of humans. Ari helps Davidson and the others find the apes' sacred city, where Davidson hopes to rendezvous with his spacecraft.The movie shifts between comedy, satire and serious action-adventure, leaving the viewer to think that the director was uncertain about which direction his 'reimagining' was supposed to go.Big budget Hollywood spectacles aren't expected to be realistic, but Planet of the Apes completely disregards anything even remotely logical. Davidson crash lands into the planet. He must have been going three hundred miles an hour. He walks away. Minutes later, he encounters the ape army for the first time. One soldier hits him hard enough to throw him about thirty yards. Another then kicks him hard in the head with his heavy boot. Our hero cannot only still get up and walk, he hasn't a single scratch nor even a hair out of place. It's a ridiculous scene and a prime example of bad screen writing.Walhberg's Davidson is a curiously flat hero. Burton has 'reimagined' him as a character with absolutely no imagination. He's not even curious as to why the apes speak English, a fact that would astound most people. He shows little desire to help free his fellow human beings from bondage. He cares only about escaping from the planet and, by extension, only about himself. If he's the hero of the future, I don't like him much. When he achieves his objective and gets back to Earth, the climatic scene there is simply a blatant setup for a sequel.Visually, Burton hasn't lost his touch. This is a lush and handsome movie, filled with the rich, dark tones that are the director's signature. The apes are realistic. They are ingeniously designed so that they are easy to tell apart from one another. I loved the way they reverted to ape behavior whenever they got angry. Oddly, this was one of their more human characteristics. But none of these pluses makes up for a lame story and a lack of vision. I can highly recommend Planet of the Apes - the original 1968 version, that is.",2,So disappointing!,1015891200,"03 12, 2002",2002,3292,"['are', 'course', 'problems', 'associated', 'being', 'movie', 'geek', 'One', 'tendency', 'get', 'neurotically', 'attached', 'work', 'favorite', 'actors', 'directors', 'become', 'emotionally', 'involved', 'work', 'become', 'family', 'nothing', 'more', 'irritating', 'family', 'member', 'disappointing', 'one.Director', 'Tim', 'Burton', '[', 'Batman', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', ']', 'one', 'favorites', 'new', ""'reimagined"", 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'weak', 'So', 'was', ""n't"", 'merely', 'disappointed', 'was', 'angry', 'How', 'could', 'Tim', 'do', 'What', 'was', 'thinking', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'so', 'imaginative', 'even', 'think', 'redoing', 'classic', 'How', 'could', 'bring', 'shame', ""'family"", 'what', 'difference', 'can', 'feelings', 'make', 'Burton', ""n't"", 'know', 'Adam.In', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Capt', 'Leo', 'Davidson', '[', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', ']', 'part', 'space', 'mission', 'studying', 'effectiveness', 'training', 'primates', 'pilot', 'small', 'space', 'craft', '[', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ask', ']', 'When', 'one', 'chimps', 'lost', 'freak', 'magnetic', 'storm', 'Davidson', 'too', 'lost', 'up', 'planet', 'where', 'rule', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'lesser', 'species', 'battle', 'apes', 'Aided', 'Ari', '[', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', ']', 'kind', 'ape', 'sort', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'reverse', 'band', 'humans', 'Ari', 'Davidson', 'others', 'find', 'apes', 'sacred', 'city', 'where', 'Davidson', 'rendezvous', 'spacecraft.The', 'movie', 'shifts', 'comedy', 'satire', 'serious', 'action-adventure', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'think', 'director', 'was', 'uncertain', 'direction', ""'reimagining"", 'was', 'supposed', 'go.Big', 'budget', 'Hollywood', 'spectacles', 'are', ""n't"", 'expected', 'be', 'realistic', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'completely', 'anything', 'even', 'remotely', 'logical', 'Davidson', 'crash', 'planet', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'going', 'three', 'hundred', 'miles', 'hour', 'away', 'Minutes', 'later', 'ape', 'army', 'first', 'time', 'One', 'soldier', 'hard', 'enough', 'throw', 'thirty', 'yards', 'then', 'hard', 'head', 'heavy', 'boot', 'hero', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'still', 'get', 'up', 'walk', ""n't"", 'single', 'scratch', 'even', 'hair', 'place', 'ridiculous', 'scene', 'prime', 'example', 'bad', 'screen', 'writing.Walhberg', 'Davidson', 'curiously', 'flat', 'hero', 'Burton', ""'reimagined"", 'character', 'absolutely', 'imagination', 'not', 'even', 'curious', 'why', 'apes', 'speak', 'English', 'fact', 'would', 'astound', 'most', 'people', 'little', 'desire', 'help', 'free', 'fellow', 'human', 'beings', 'bondage', 'only', 'escaping', 'planet', 'extension', 'only', 'hero', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'much', 'When', 'objective', 'back', 'Earth', 'climatic', 'scene', 'simply', 'blatant', 'setup', 'sequel.Visually', 'Burton', ""n't"", 'lost', 'touch', 'lush', 'handsome', 'movie', 'filled', 'rich', 'dark', 'tones', 'are', 'director', 'signature', 'apes', 'are', 'realistic', 'are', 'ingeniously', 'designed', 'so', 'are', 'easy', 'tell', 'apart', 'one', 'loved', 'way', 'reverted', 'ape', 'behavior', 'whenever', 'got', 'angry', 'Oddly', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'human', 'characteristics', 'none', 'pluses', 'up', 'lame', 'story', 'lack', 'vision', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'original', '1968', 'version']",N/A

541034,A3IB5WCHJVJA4N,B00003CXXU,"MF Regan ""Seth""","[13, 16]","I cited in my Beneath review that the origional Planet of the Apes is my favorite film. When the various whispers of remakes in the trades led to this- and to the onslaught of reviewers who said that Burton succeeded- had 're-imagined' the concept, I still didn't want to see it. When Daryl Zanuck (Head of Fox) stated in a review I read a few days after the release of this, it depressed him that people thought it was a remake; that he was greenlighting an adaptation of the origional Boulle novel, I went.After it was over, I walked up the aisle of the theatre and looked at the faces of others who had come, like me, to see what the hell the fuss was about. Their faces echoed mine! What the hell did we just watch? Did anyone actually watch the origional? Is this a joke or something?I spoke with a number of 20 something's who thought it was a great remake. I had asked them whether they had seen the origional. Some had and some had not. I then asked for one 'great line'- one sentence in the screenplay, uttered by the central character that would lead all of the humans to follow him out into the desert to fight. No response. I then asked why the female ape committed herself to aiding the astronaut when  barely a word had been exchanged between them during his initial captivity; anything that would remotely suggest a difference or intelligence that made him special from the other humans that surrounded them. They began to agree that seemed kind of lame.Once again, not one line in the screenplay or in the writing to spark that kind of belief or development in the story. In the origional, we got to know what Taylor thought and  believed- what he was looking for as he crossed the desert. The astronaut in this piece crashes and is in a net so fast, you wonder whether there's a gun under your theatre seat- whether you're supposed to grab it, shoot at the screen and claim a prize for saving the astronaut with the theatre owners! (Damn! I've probably just given some studio exec an idea for a promotion for the next remake in line!)All that had been developed painstakingly in the first screenplay- and then performed so well with relish by the origional cast, played like a video game in this remake. And I have to say, I was really kind of stunned by some of the critical reaction praising this kind of work. It was very lame, two dimensional stuff. Cartoon, really.I've read some of the reviews of this film-  raves of a screenplay that barely rises above the origional novel. The problem with the novel (as the origional film team stated accurately) was that, although it was a fabulous idea, it was really non cinematic. If memory serves, it was a psychological study of 'what would it feel like if we were the ones in the cage, looking out '. That's a take that reads well but translates poorly when played. But it's funny because this remake also seems a mix of an idea that Boulle had pitched to Arthur P. Jacobs when he was asked to write a treatment for the origional sequel: 'Beneath'- (about Taylor leading a fight against the apes to reclaim the planet). Jacobs politely turned that down as uncinematic as well. He was right and I think this remake really demonstrates that; demonstrates the kind of real thinking that has to go on, to lift an idea and give it shape, scope and truth.The onslaught of remakes that have come and gone lately(ie Lost In Space/The Time Machine/Frankenstein/I Spy/Starsky & Hutch)have got me feeling philosophical.The origional producer of Apes, Arthur P. Jacobs, marched an idea that was fresh, new and different around for 3 to 4 years- had everyone in a business built on  fantasy, telling him the idea would be laughed off the screen, and then they closed their doors. He pressed on and got others involved and excited about it (ie: Serling, Heston and Schaffner ).They got it made and nobody laughed (except when they were supposed to). It became a classic because it was fresh and new, and everyone who worked on it brought the energy of wanting it to succeed.It's about passion, I think.I guess the point I'm trying to make is- I'd really like to see this generation get the chance to make their magic.Give them the greenlight to chance their ideas- not ones that seem a sure thing for a fast but lame return. You can rush a film into a multitude of theatres, make huge money before the word of mouth reveals it for the turkey that it is. But considering what you initially spend on these things and what little you're contributing in effort, art or inspiration- what is the point?What if Wells, Ford, Capra, Demille, Huston, Fleming, Whales and others had settled for and merely made the obvious?None of us would be anywhere if we kept trying to climb and descend the same staircase, trying to look cooler each time we did it. There's only one letter that seperates cool from fool. And that's not much. Either are remakes.Oliver Stone wanted to remake Planet- so did James Cameron, at one point. I think they both probably screened it, realized it was Schaffner's gem and it probably inspired them to get back to shooting for classics of their own. So should have Burton. Tim Burton is a visual genious. I love the look of his work and he has some classics in him, too.This isn't one of them.Appreciate the classics- learn from them, be inspired by them, then fight for the right to create your own. Read the history and then realize a baton is being passed.",1,Remakes Are Mistakes,1099353600,"11 2, 2004",2004,5427,"['cited', 'Beneath', 'review', 'origional', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'favorite', 'film',

Think &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and you can envision Vincent Price a la Gepetto fashioning Edward's scissor-hands out of garden shears and the brightly painted cotton candy houses where Edward goes to live.  Think &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; and the headless horseman yearning to be reunited with his head so he can find everlasting peace.  And on and on in Burton's films you can see the dreamer at work and at play.  In &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; Burton chose to base his movie on the original source material: the Pierre Boule novel not the previous POA films.  A good move I think.  As with most of Burton's films this &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; is a very dark film both in mood and in lighting or lack thereof.  And also like all of Burton's movies this film  is extraordinarily beautiful to look at with all the production values first rate especially the make up and masks by Rick Baker. This newest &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; charts the fantastical journey of Leo (Mark Wahlberg) into a land where Apes rule the world.  He spends the entire movie attempting to return home much like Dorothy in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;  In his attempt to get home he meets up with a &quot;human activist&quot; ape, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) who helps him find his way home and a nemesis, General Thade (Tim Roth) who doesn't.  All this is done in a hyper style of acting befitting this kind of material. This is not the best work that Burton has done but it is exciting and fun and there is a great surprise ending.

(More on that later).  Burton's direction is good; the ape makeup is the best ever; Helena Bonham Carter is delightful as the ape Ari; Mark Wahlberg made it through the movie without having to take his shirt off (Charlton spent most of the original in a loincloth, if you'll remember,ladies).

I liked the heroism the humans evidenced by the end, and Roth's diabolically manic performance was awesome.Danny Elfman's Afro-influenced score also great.Now, the ending..what makes it worse is that in Tim Burton's commentary, he never actually tells you what in the world he was hoping to achieve with this completely inexcusable ending.  Not only did it negate what we had just viewed, it made Wahlberg's heroic efforts completely useless.  I remember in the first when I saw the crumbled Statue of Liberty, my mouth drop opened and the full impact of the movie is irreplaceable.

It doesn't work visually, and2) the script is terrible, so it doesn't work on any level below visually.3) The best actor in the film had to have been Tim Roth, and I must question the logic of taking him and applying so much makeup and costuming so as to eliminate the actor. He can't emote through the mask and he has to affect a raspy ""monster voice"" that obscures any of his vocal talents. And his villainous character is far too one-dimensional, despite attempts to make him otherwise with Charlton Heston's cute cameo. The other actors are either similarly buried, or grossly undertalented in relation to their roles.4) The ending... well, I won't even go there.

The Good; The Make-Up; There are only two words to describe Rick Baker's make-up: In-genious. The guy has always been the best and now he has surpassed even himself. His ape-make-up is flawless. Even apes with a short amount of screen time have amazing detail and individuality in their features. Baker easily has an Academy Award coming for his work here. The Acting; The Best Actors wore the most make-up. Everyone in an ape suit busted their butt and delivered first rate performances. Maybe they had to work harder to overcome wearing tons of make-up, maybe I just credit them with good acting because they were wearing all that make-up, all I know is that the made up actors were more expressive and convincing than the barefaced actors. 2. The Bad. They cut out it's brain, those bloody baboons! Sorry, I coudn't resist. That's a line from the origianl movie. It gets the point across. All the great satire that the original possessed is gone,cut out, eliminated. The book was mostly social satire and the original movie was pretty true to that. But not this one. It flirts with satire,it dabbles in it,it buys a ticket to the game but never gets into the same ballpark as the original movie as far as the satire and social commentary. It's watered down. I know they were excpecting lots of kids to flock to this flick, but I think the apes brutality was really underplayed. I'm not even talking about violence , much of which occurred off screen. Except for Thade and the profiteer Limbo, the apes weren't all that nasty to the humans. There is even an Animal Rights group that supports Human Rights. I never felt the overwhelming,oppressing menace that I felt with the original movie. Also, when the two big silverbacks locked up for their Big Fight, it was so anti-climactic. I expected fur and blood to fly when the arch-rivals met, instead I saw a slap fight between two mincing flight attendants. The Acting; Amazingly, all the actors without make-up were about as emotive as a wooden bedpost. There was no need for the humans to talk in this version, none of them said anything worth hearing.

541040,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B00003CXXU,Michael R Gates,"[0, 0]","The detailed review:There are only two commendable aspects of this 2001 &quot;re-imagining&quot; of the classic Sci-Fi allegory: The first is the musical score by composer Danny Elfman, which is simply excellent (as is nearly always the case with his work); the other--and the best--is the outstanding simian make-up work of Rick Baker and his crew.  The make-up FX for the apes in this film looks even better (i.e., more articulate and realistic) than the groundbreaking and influential make-up that John Chambers created for 1968's original PLANET OF THE APES, and had auteur Tim Burton and his crew stuck closer to the basic plot and overall socio-political subtext of the first film, they could have created a thought-provoking and aesthetically breathtaking update of what author and film historian Eric Greene calls the American myth of the 20th century.  Instead, Burton's take on PLANET OF THE APES is a tepid piece of celluloid that, while still visually stunning, is a travesty at best.Okay, then, the film itself is pretty lackluster.  But what about the DVDs?  In this day and age when technology allows tons of information to be packed onto one or two little plastic-and-aluminum discs, many lousy films are marketed with bonus extras that are actually better than the film itself.  And the 2-Disc Special Edition of 2001's PLANET OF THE APES is a prime example.  It is loaded with lots of cool bonus features like commentaries (one by Burton; the other by composer Elfman) and deleted scenes, but the real treats are the featurettes that take the viewer behind the scenes in several aspects of the making of the film.  Just a few of the items discussed: The creation a special &quot;school&quot; for the actors so they could learn to move like an ape; costume design and creation; make-up FX; music for the film; and much more.  Even for a rather dull remake like this film, learning a bit about how the cinematic illusions are created is fascinating.  This alone makes the 2-Disc set worth purchasing.

541044,AURZ4YQ270W3T,B00003CXXU,Mike Freed,"[2, 3]","Love them or hate them, the films of Tim Burton are the product of a truly unique visual voice, laced with images that don't leave your mind easily or quickly. The brilliant, brooding Gotham City of ""Batman."" The eerie, cheery world of Pee Wee Herman. The topiary trees in ""Edward Scissorhands."" The Gothic vision of the Headless Horseman in ""Sleepy Hollow.""And now we have this remake of 1968's classic ""Planet of the Apes,"" and if there ever were a project in need of a visionary director like Burton, it was this one. But for some reason, Burton, who's normally as visionary as directors come, seemed to have the blinders on this time around.The result is a movie that plays like a more imaginative version of generic Hollywood action movies like ""The Mummy."" It's nice to look at (and in fairness, the makeup effects are absolutely brilliant), and it's witty at times, but ultimately ""Planet of the Apes"" is - and here's a word not often associated with Tim Burton - forgettable....P>Most Tim Burton movies also feature at least one larger-than-life performance (the most obvious being Jack Nicholson as the Joker), but in ""Planet of the Apes,"" there simply isn't one. Tim Roth tries for over-the-top as Thade, the leader of the ape society, but he mainly succeeds in making guttural noises. Mark Wahlberg is completely forgettable in his update of the Charlton Heston role, and the other various humans in the movie just blend right into the background.Only Helena Bonham Carter (Ari, a ""human rights"" activist) and Paul Giamatti as an orangutan slave trader, add any spice to their roles. Heston himself has a nice turn as Thade's dying father, and manages to re-deliver his most famous line as an actor (yep, you know the one), and get a gun into the movie at the same time.That little tidbit, along with lines like ""extremism in the defense of apes is no vice"" makes up some of this film's small pleasures, but they're too far between, and even the production, while lavish, doesn't break ground the way the original did. The ape city, in particular, was a disappointment - it ends up looking a whole lot like Bangkok. Come to think of it, much of the ape society borrows too much from familiar designs (Roman and Asian, for two) to really spark the imagination. Where was the utterly original look of, say, Gotham City when we needed it?The science fiction here is also subpar. As the film progresses, we learn that the humans on the planet of the apes are descended from Wahlberg's fellow astronauts, and the apes are the descendents of genetically-enhanced apes that were on the Wahlberg's spaceship. At some point, the two species clashed, and the apes obviously won.But the facts of the plot don't give us any reason to believe that's what happened. After all, the humans had guns, and the apes didn't, which, as Thade's dying father points out, would have been the great equalizer. We even find out that much of the technology on the spaceship was functional thousands of years after it crash landed. Given this, how exactly did the humans succumb to the apes in battle? If the power sources on the spaceship were still active thousands of years after it crashed, couldn't they have been adapted for use on this new planet, and used to create a technocratic human society away from Earth?At least in the original ""Ape"" series, there's a logical reason why the apes became ascendant over the humans - the humans, as Heston's famous line exclaims, ""blew it all up,"" destroying their own civilization. Did the astronauts who crash landed have a civil war? I'm sorry, but I don't see the logic here.I'm sure that the answer to those questions might be well be the plot to ""Ape"" sequels, but unless they've got some very creative writers on staff, I just don't see how any credible answers could be created. And, unfortunately, that's just one more disappoint in a film that's chock full of them.",2,Tim Burton phones one in...,1049500800,"04 5, 2003",2003,3905,"['Love', 'hate', 'films', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'are', 'product', 'truly', 'unique', 'visual', 'voice', 'laced', 'images', 'do', ""n't"", 'leave', 'mind', 'easily', 'quickly', 'brilliant', 'brooding', 'Gotham', 'City', 'Batman', 'eerie', 'cheery', 'world', 'Pee', 'Wee', 'Herman', 'topiary', 'trees', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Gothic', 'vision', 'Headless', 'Horseman', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'now', 'have', 'remake', '1968', 'classic', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'ever', 'were', 'project', 'need', 'visionary', 'director', 'Burton', 'was', 'one', 'reason', 'Burton', 'who', 'normally', 'as', 'visionary', 'directors', 'come', 'seemed', 'have', 'blinders', 'time', 'around.The', 'result', 'movie', 'more', 'imaginative', 'version', 'generic', 'Hollywood', 'action', 'movies', 'Mummy', 'nice', 'look', 'fairness', 'makeup', 'effects', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'witty', 'times', 'ultimately', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'here', 'word', 'not', 'often', 'associated', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'forgettable', '.P', '>', 'Most', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movies', 'also', 'feature', 'least', 'one', 'larger-than-life', 'performance', 'most', 'obvious', 'being', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Joker', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'simply', ""n't"", 'one', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'tries', 'over-the-top', 'Thade', 'leader', 'ape', 'society', 'mainly', 'making', 'guttural', 'noises', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'completely', 'forgettable', 'update', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'role', 'other', 'various', 'humans', 'movie', 'just', 'blend', 'right', 'background.Only', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Ari', 'human', 'rights', 'activist', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'orangutan', 'slave', 'trader', 'add', 'spice', 'roles', 'Heston', 'nice', 'turn', 'Thade', 'dying', 'father', 're-deliver', 'most', 'famous', 'line', 'actor', 'yep', 'know', 'one', 'get', 'gun', 'movie', 'same', 'little', 'tidbit', 'lines', 'extremism', 'defense', 'apes', 'vice', 'up', 'film', 'small', 'pleasures', ""'re"", 'too', 'far', 'even', 'production', 'lavish', ""n't"", 'break', 'ground', 'way', 'original', 'did', 'ape', 'city', 'particular', 'was', 'disappointment', 'up', 'looking', 'whole', 'lot', 'Bangkok', 'Come', 'think', 'much', 'ape', 'society', 'too', 'much', 'familiar', 'designs', 'Roman', 'Asian', 'two', 'really', 'spark', 'imagination', 'Where', 'was', 'utterly', 'original', 'look', 'say', 'Gotham', 'City', 'when', 'needed', 'science', 'fiction', 'here', 'also', 'subpar', 'film', 'learn', 'humans', 'planet', 'apes', 'are', 'descended', 'Wahlberg', 'fellow', 'astronauts', 'apes', 'are', 'descendents', 'genetically-enhanced', 'apes', 'were', 'Wahlberg', 'spaceship', 'point', 'two', 'species', 'clashed', 'apes', 'obviously', 'won.But', 'facts', 'plot', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'reason', 'believe', 'what', 'happened', 'humans', 'had', 'guns', 'apes', 'did', ""n't"", 'Thade', 'dying', 'father', 'points', 'out', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'equalizer', 'even', 'find', 'out', 'much', 'technology', 'spaceship', 'was', 'functional', 'thousands', 'years', 'landed', 'Given', 'how', 'exactly', 'did', 'humans', 'succumb', 'apes', 'battle', 'power', 'sources', 'spaceship', 'were', 'still', 'active', 'thousands', 'years', 'crashed', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'adapted', 'use', 'new', 'planet', 'used', 'create', 'technocratic', 'human', 'society', 'away', 'Earth', 'least', 'original', 'Ape', 'series', 'logical', 'reason', 'why', 'apes', 'became', 'ascendant', 'humans', 'humans', 'Heston', 'famous', 'line', 'exclaims', 'blew', 'up', 'destroying', 'own', 'civilization', 'Did', 'astronauts', 'who', 'crash', 'landed', 'have', 'civil', 'war', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'logic', 'here.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'answer', 'questions', 'might', 'be', 'well', 'be', 'plot', 'Ape', 'sequels', ""'ve"", 'got', 'very', 'creative', 'writers', 'staff', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'how', 'credible', 'answers', 'could', 'be', 'created', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'one', 'more', 'disappoint', 'film', 'chock', 'full']",N/A
541045,A1JMQ88IMH0XJL,B00003CXXU,Mike,"[2, 3]","&quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001)Being a huge fan of the original, I went along to Planet of the Apes expecting an entertaining, if not brilliant film. That is exactly what you get with this movie. This movie isn't about build-up and a perfect script, it's about having fun and being entertained. On that surface, Planet of the Apes definitely succeeded.That's not saying it doesn't have flaws or anything, because this ""re-imagining"" of the hugely popular and classical 1968 movie does have problems. For starters, the whole mystery and atmosphere of the island is gone with this film. In the 1968 film the atmospheric tension and mysterious moodiness of Planet of the Apes is what brought it most vividly alive. In this movie, it's more about showing off the latest designing techniques and special effect mountains, not about the tension in the air. That was especially the case with the whole &quot;ape city"" part of the movie. I thought that was really quite laughable, not because it looked bad or anything, but because the apes just are amusing in the wrong way. In the 1968 movie (excuse all these comparisons) the apes are funny because they are like human replicas, treating humans like dogs. I liked that perspective of the first film. The 2001 version has the apes just seeming...funny, and completely stupid.I also disagreed - along with many - about the casting of Mark Wahlberg. I really like the guy as an actor, but in the leading performance Markie Mark just suffered. He made the character looked cold and not at all stressed or surprised that he was surrounded by a bunch of mute people and apes that can talk. Okay, so we all know he wasn't going to be a new Mr. Heston, but his performance as Leo remains very unsatisfying and his dullest to date.Despite those couple of flaws, I no doubt enjoyed myself in the action sequences, loved the makeup, and thought the scenery was gorgeous and I thoroughly (with the excuse of Wahlberg) enjoyed some of the performances. Tim Roth was especially menacing, power-hungry and amazingly ape-like in the role he was born to play. Roth may come off funny to some viewers, but hey, are apes funny? Roth was perfect casting. Another perfect casting was Helena Bonham Carter, who is known well for her continuous quality performances. In this movie she plays the most delicate and developed character and her acting helped the character become more vivid, memorable and strong. Well done there.Another thing I loved about the movie is it never slows down. Sure, I was quite bored during the development of the apes' world, but the action and sense of old-fashioned adventure make this movie amazing appealing. The movie is always on its toes, always moving, and we always have something to look at.One thing that disappointed me about the movie is - and I can't believe I'm saying this - Tim Burton's directing. He just doesn't make the film as moody or atmospheric as his previous productions. Tim does outline what he wants to do well and how he wants it done extremely well, but he could've put more effort into the way the movie looks in terms of techniques and editing, considering his previous efforts like Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow are works of atmospheric joy.However, Tim makes sure the movie starts with a bang and ends with a bang, and that's what I was interested in with Planet of the Apes. It's not perfect, but it remains one of the most eye-catching and fun movies of summer 2001.MY GRADE: B-",4,Fun re-imagining.,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",2002,3480,"['quot', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'quot', '2001', 'Being', 'huge', 'fan', 'original', 'went', 'along', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'expecting', 'entertaining', 'not', 'brilliant', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'get', 'movie', 'movie', ""n't"", 'build-up', 'perfect', 'script', 'having', 'fun', 'being', 'entertained', 'surface', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'definitely', 'succeeded.That', 'not', 'saying', ""n't"", 'have', 'flaws', 'anything', 're-imagining', 'hugely', 'popular', 'classical', '1968', 'movie', 'have', 'problems', 'starters', 'whole', 'mystery', 'atmosphere', 'island', 'gone', 'film', '1968', 'film', 'atmospheric', 'tension', 'mysterious', 'moodiness', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'what', 'brought', 'most', 'vividly', 'alive', 'movie', 'more', 'showing', 'off', 'latest', 'designing', 'techniques', 'special', 'effect', 'mountains', 'not', 'tension', 'air', 'was', 'especially', 'case', 'whole', 'quot', 'city', 'part', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'quite', 'laughable', 'not', 'looked', 'bad', 'anything', 'apes', 'just', 'are', 'amusing', 'wrong', 'way', '1968', 'movie', 'comparisons', 'apes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'human', 'replicas', 'treating', 'humans', 'dogs', 'liked', 'perspective', 'first', 'film', '2001', 'version', 'apes', 'just', 'seeming', 'funny', 'completely', 'stupid.I', 'also', 'disagreed', 'many', 'casting', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'really', 'guy', 'actor', 'leading', 'performance', 'Markie', 'Mark', 'just', 'suffered', 'made', 'character', 'looked', 'cold', 'not', 'stressed', 'surprised', 'was', 'surrounded', 'bunch', 'mute', 'people', 'apes', 'can', 'talk', 'Okay', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'new', 'Mr.', 'Heston', 'performance', 'Leo', 'very', 'unsatisfying', 'dullest', 'date.Despite', 'couple', 'flaws', 'doubt', 'enjoyed', 'action', 'sequences', 'loved', 'makeup', 'thought', 'scenery', 'was', 'gorgeous', 'thoroughly', 'excuse', 'Wahlberg', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'was', 'especially', 'menacing', 'power-hungry', 'amazingly', 'ape-like', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Roth', 'may', 'come', 'off', 'funny', 'viewers', 'hey', 'are', 'apes', 'funny', 'Roth', 'was', 'perfect', 'casting', 'perfect', 'casting', 'was', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'who', 'known', 'well', 'continuous', 'quality', 'performances', 'movie', 'most', 'delicate', 'developed', 'character', 'acting', 'helped', 'character', 'become', 'more', 'vivid', 'memorable', 'strong', 'Well', 'done', 'there.Another', 'thing', 'loved', 'movie', 'never', 'down', 'Sure', 'was', 'quite', 'bored', 'development', 'apes', 'world', 'action', 'sense', 'old-fashioned', 'adventure', 'make', 'movie', 'amazing', 'appealing', 'movie', 'always', 'toes', 'always', 'moving', 'always', 'have', 'something', 'look', 'at.One', 'thing', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'saying', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'directing', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'previous', 'productions', 'Tim', 'outline', 'what', 'do', 'well', 'how', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'could', ""'ve"", 'put', 'more', 'effort', 'way', 'movie', 'terms', 'techniques', 'editing', 'considering', 'previous', 'efforts', 'Edward', 'Scissorhands', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'are', 'works', 'atmospheric', 'joy.However', 'Tim', 'sure', 'movie', 'bang', 'bang', 'what', 'was', 'interested', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'not', 'perfect', 'one', 'most', 'eye-catching', 'fun', 'movies', 'summer', '2001.MY', 'GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

The Good;  The Make-Up; There are only two words to describe Rick Baker's make-up: In-genious.  The guy has always been the best and now he has surpassed even himself. His ape-make-up is flawless. Even apes with a short amount of screen time have amazing detail and individuality in their features. Baker easily has an Academy Award coming for his work here.  The Acting; The Best Actors wore the most make-up. Everyone in an ape suit busted their butt and delivered first rate performances. Maybe they had to work harder to overcome wearing tons of make-up, maybe I just credit them with good acting because they were wearing all that make-up, all I know is that the made up actors were more expressive and convincing than the barefaced actors. 2. The Bad.  They cut out it's brain, those bloody baboons!  Sorry, I coudn't resist. That's a line from the origianl movie. It gets the point across. All the great satire that the original possessed is gone,cut out, eliminated. The book was mostly social satire and the original movie was pretty true to that. But not this one. It flirts with satire,it dabbles in it,it buys a ticket to the game but never gets into the same ballpark as the original movie as far as the satire and social commentary.  It's watered down. I know they were excpecting lots of kids to flock to this flick, but I think the apes brutality was really underplayed. I'm not even talking about violence , much of which occurred off screen. Except for Thade and the profiteer Limbo, the apes weren't all that nasty to the humans.  There is even an Animal Rights group that supports Human Rights. I never felt the overwhelming,oppressing menace that I felt with the original movie. Also, when the two big silverbacks locked up for their Big Fight, it was so anti-climactic. I expected fur and blood to fly when the arch-rivals met, instead I saw a slap fight between two mincing flight attendants.  The Acting; Amazingly, all the actors without make-up were about as emotive as a wooden bedpost. There was no need for the humans to talk in this version, none of them said anything worth hearing.

The problem here, and it's the same problem he ran head-on into with the dreadful ""Mars Attacks"", is that he's trying to make a campy and kitschy homage.  But you can't intentionally concoct camp and kitsch; they are unintentionally and organically grown from the best of intentions.  And they are especially undermined by a plus size budget.Witness the references and gimmicks he throws at the screen, hoping for a knowing chuckle from an aware audience: an ape yells ""Take your stinking hands off me you damn dirty *human*""; Charlton Heston makes a cameo and cries ""damn them all... damn them all to hell"" again, only this time he's an ape; and a twist ending utilizes a famous landmark for shock value.  Taken out of context, these all seem like damn good ideas.  But when they're the screenwriters' only good ideas, how much weight can they really carry?  Not much, I'd say.My hope going in was that Burton would at least do a fine job creating a contained world, one that we'd never seen before.  Well, I'd seen it before... in the first ""Apes"" movie.  Sure, there are more vines on the walls, and most of the scenes in ""Ape City"" are filmed during dusk or night hours instead of under harsh sunlight, but the basic pod-like structure of the city was too familiar to give any credit to Burton and his production designers.  As for the apes themselves, most of the time their make-up looked magnificent.  Each character had his/her own distinctive face with a budding personality.  Unfortunately, when shot in close-up the make-up tends to look fake, and not nearly enough attention was paid to the women's make-up as the men's.  Also, the nature of the apes' social interactions could have been explored further.  The film touches on this subject, showing apes quietly grooming each other, or displaying their position in the pecking order with solid punches.  But anyone who's read Will Self's satire ""Great Apes"" (which borrows its central idea from the original ""Planet of the Apes"") will know that there was a whole spectrum of actions that could have been shown, but sadly weren't.The most grievous error, to my mind, is the fact that Burton had a wonderful cast of actors to work with (I count at least four Oscar nominations in the group), and barely a single, well-defined character to offer them.Helena Bonham Carter gets the most to do.  Her Ari, a senator's daughter, is the vocal conscience of the film, aghast at the second-class treatment humans get.  She is intelligent (or at least relative to her company), passionate, and strong-willed.  Carter also manages to wring some sex appeal from Ari, with either a lingering glance or a gentle nod of the head.  Too bad her subtle advances towards astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) are never reciprocated.  Wahlberg, an actor who I usually like, is as bland as white bread here.  He is nothing more than a talk-softly-and-carry-a-big-stick macho guy.  I can't remember Leo ever stringing two or more sentences together.  He is vaguely heroic, patriotic, stubborn, and simple-minded.  These attributes could have worked -- the innocent thrust into a fantastic situation -- but Leo is supposed to be a complicated man with complicated problems; too bad he isn't.  If Wahlberg as Leo gets to play three different colors here -- red, white, and blue -- then Tim Roth as General Thade gets only one: blood red.  Roth is a fantastic actor, limited to constant anger here.  Thade is never allowed to show any humanity (or, rather, chimpanity).  He's stuck in fourth gear for the entire picture.  And frankly, I didn't find him that menacing.  Michael Clarke Duncan pulls off his big and burly silverback gorilla quite well, although it's more of a physical role than an emotional one.  Estella Warren is really just around for eye-candy (she has wonderfully pouty lips, and appears to have an endless supply of lipstick!).  It's one of the most inconsequential roles I've seen in years.  Paul Giamatti, as a human slave-trader, is dirty, grimy, quite real, and terribly funny.  He seems to be the only member of the cast (besides possibly Roth) who understands how to perform facial expressions under his make-up.  He needed more screen time, if only to help break up the monotony.As the story winds down to its inevitable big-bang conclusion, things get a little muddled.  The explanation of the apes' origin was handled quite well; it's the one plot point that the filmmaker's appear to have thought through, and nearly duplicates the surprise end of the original ""Apes"" movie.  But then, we are treated to a ludicrously hokey `deux es machinas' conclusion to the final battle.  And from there, it's only a hop, skip, and a jump to the incredibly illogical conclusion, which is just shock-value for the sake of shock-value, and a bold-faced lie.  The filmmakers show the audience one thing, and then expect them to believe another.  It just can't happen the way it does.  If anyone can explain to me why it can, please do.  Otherwise, I will continue to be angered by the deception.  And resentful of the memory of this shoddy movie.",2,&quot;I hate every ape I see / From chimpan-A to chimpan-Z&quot;,1005004800,"11 6, 2001",2001,5305,"['am', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'fan', 'standard',

It is an enjoyable film to watch, but I feel it is let down by it's star, Mark Walhberg. Walhberg does not have the charisma or screen presence of a Charlton Heston, and is unable to lead this film the way it needed to be. Besides that, a mixture of a poorly written character, and his poor portrayal of that character result in the lead role being quite shallow. The mililary leader of the apes - Tim Roth - and his sidekick - Michael Clarke Duncan - both ham their parts well, and Helena Bonham-Carter is surprisingly convincing as an enlightened ape. The effects are good, the music score by Danny Elfman (Batman, Sleepy Hollow etc) is superb, and the plot has an intriguing twist at the end. Unfortunately, Walhberg's performance simply lets the film down. It is difficult to specify this exactly, but it is a feeling that one gets when looking back at the film immediately after it has finished. It is an enjoyable film nonetheless, and is perfect if you want to hire out a film for the evening.

541050,A1OXUVBFZAAQAQ,B00003CXXU,minguy,"[2, 3]","Planet of the Apes is visually alluring, but not cinematically fulfilling. Burton presents a world that is overwhelmingly dark, both in tone (humans are slaves, the apes their masters) and color (the jungles are dark, the villages are dark, even the apes are dark). In a summer action flick like this, where you expect it to be fun and enjoyable, heavy themes are most effective when they're subtle. But POTA just whacks you on the head with the prejudice theme and continues to do so for the better part of the two hour film. It rarely cracks a joke and passes on the numerous opportunities to poke fun at itself and the POTA franchise. Instead, Burton spends the first two thirds of the film establishing how humans are treated like animals. It is, of course, supposed to be ironic and reflective of the way humans treat animals. But talk about overdoing it! Just to be sure you get it, there is a sequence where a young ape chooses a young girl to be her pet (sheesh!).Now, I welcome dark and edgy themes as much as the next brooding film buff, especially from a filmmaker like Burton. But the visuals take such priority in POTA that the rest of the film suffers as a result. The storyline is barely existent. The characters are dull and one-dimensional. And the ending - not the cliffhanger ending (more on that later) but the climactic-battle ending - is a total sell out. C'mon, a ""savior"" drops in from the sky and suddenly the apes see the error of their ways??? Deus ex machina, anyone?Burton has shown himself to be a great filmmaker and an even better storyteller. We watch his films to be thrilled and excited and scared by his exotic worlds and his wild and wonderful characters.  Don't expect any of that here.There is ONE thing I liked about the story: the origin of the apes. Nothing too original or amazing, but I was pleasantly surprised. The rest is horrible. Especially, the surprise ""let's-leave-you-hanging-cause-there's-going-to-be-a-sequel"" ending, which I assume is supposed to ""blow your mind.""""Re-imagining"" indeed.

541051,A57N3RPYBIN89,B00003CXXU,"M. ""-m-""","[17, 32]","Obviously, from the reviews, a number of people enjoyed this film.  At the showing I attended, there were even some people clapping at the end... but I wasn't one of them.Nothing makes a good movie seem like a bad movie like claiming it's a great movie.  Over-hype as been a bane for me more than once, and I specifically avoided advertising and promotion for this film because I WANTED to like it, even if it wasn't particularly great.  Unfortunately, it didn't help because I didn't think the film was even particularly good.Worst out of a bad lot is the in-your-face over-acting that Burton seems to have enforced on the ape actors.  Apparently, the director decided that over-acting is what makes for a convincing ape, and so you end up with the most appalling and painful performances I have seen in a long time.  The cast includes some truly excellent actors, but their talent is lost under all the ""aping"" they're forced to do.  Tim Roth's character, especially, becomes impossible to watch almost immediately.  The over-acting of the ape actors also serves to wash out the actors playing the human characters.  Although their performances are not bad, none of them are strong enough to avoid be over-shadowed by all the over-acting.  They come across looking wooden by comparison, and you end up with the worst of both worlds.As for the story and script, it is all too obviously a product of the modern Hollywood `blipvert' mentality.  There's no development and depth to speak of, just straight off to the races with explosions, crashes, and special effects.  Sometimes this works - `Con Air,' for example - but `Planet of the Apes' needs and deserves more.  It's short attention span theatre at its worst.  And because of this, you end up with the special effects feeling like they're being rammed down your throat at every opportunity.  This is most demonstrated by the constant need of the film to remind you that these are apes you are looking at.  It's not enough for one of the ape characters to just jump onto a horse.  Instead they need to bounce of eight walls, four ceilings, do a spin, a triple back-flip, and THEN land on their horse.  This is fine for the fight scenes where it can at least be considered appropriate, but it is done continuously to the point of distracting you from the story.  But then, given the lack of story, maybe that's the point.  Also, if you are prone to motion-sickness, beware of the early scenes where the humans are first captured.  The camera keeps panning up, down, and from side to side non-stop as the captives are taken through the city.  Not only does this prevent you from actually being able to get a look at the ape city, but it also leaves you feeling nauseous.I really wanted to like this film, but I just couldn't find it in me.  From a rushed beginning (""gotta start BIG!!"") to a totally obvious ending (which seems so weak when compared to the original film), there is almost nothing here.  I chuckled once at the first nod (by quote) the film makes to the original, but when they try it the second time with Heston and Roth's scene, it is genuinely painful.  Maybe there's just something wrong with me.

A renewed cinematic reinterpretation? or as is the case of Tim Burton, as I suspect, a long life dream to pay hommage to a book/ film he greatly admires?No matter what the reason is, it is surely a venture wrought with difficulties from the start. How many adaptations or remakes have succeeded more than the original? very few, even the ones that are adapted from a foreign film, and as a result don't have popular recognition, have invariably failed to capture the originality or power of the first film, whether the adaptation/remake is copied frame by frame,(Assasins, Vanilla Sky, Birdcage etc...) or 'inspired by'.The original Planet of the Apes was certainly a classic masterpiece..A beautiful piece of moviemaking that has a lot to offer than mere entertainment.The film has has such an impact on audiences, and spawned many sequels and a TV series, that to remake it, even by an able and creative director like Tim Burton, will whether it is an actual remake or a different adaptation of Boulle's classic book, it will be associated with the original.I could not watch this new version without thinking of the original, and this is why I did not appreciate it so much.The casting is very good, and Walhberg is indeed a good actor, but Estella Warren was somehow miscast as the beautiful female 'savage' turned Walhberg side-kick.She is too distractingly beautiful and fresh to be her intended character, and I expected her, whenever she was in a close up to advertise for some shampoo or beauty product.The make up is great though, and the DVD is packed with extras.Yet something remains missing from the film. The sheer power and philosophical undertones, the harshness and apocalyptic atmosphere of the first.Although Burton's ending of his film is quite clever, it remains somehow a bit polished to have the same power as the scene that confronted Heston and with him the viewers in the first Planet of Apes.You can certainly still enjoy this film, only if you manage not to think of the original Planet of the Apes, something I found very hard to do, and for that reason I was disappointed, and hope that Hollywood, the movie industry and film makers would rethink their strategy and method whenever they remake or adapt a film that is a classic.(Dr Zhivago was recently remade for British TV and flopped instantly!)..and remember it is indeed extremely hard task.",3,Guilty By Association,1048723200,"03 27, 2003",2003,2469,"['What', 'filmakers', 'want', 'rework/adapt', 'already', 'classic', 'film', 'need', 'sure', 'hit', 'renewed', 'cinematic', 'reinterpretation', 'case', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'suspect', 'long', 'life', 'dream', 'pay', 'hommage', 'book/', 'film', 'greatly', 'matter', 'what', 'reason', 'surely', 'venture', 'wrought', 'difficulties', 'start', 'How', 'many', 'adaptations', 'remakes', 'have', 'succeeded', 'more', 'original', 'very', 'few', 'even', 'ones', 'are', 'adapted', 'foreign', 'film', 'result', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'popular', 'recognition', 'have', 'invariably', 'failed', 'capture', 'originality', 'power', 'first', 'film', 'adaptation/remake', 'copied', 'frame', 'frame', 'Assasins', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Birdcage', 'etc', ""'inspired"", 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'certainly', 'classic', 'masterpiece..A', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'moviemaking', 'lot', 'offer', 'mere', 'entertainment.The', 'film', 'such', 'impact', 'audiences', 'spawned', 'many', 'sequels', 'TV', 'series', 'remake', 'even', 'able', 'creative', 'director', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'will', 'actual', 'remake', 'different', 'adaptation', 'Boulle', 'classic', 'book', 'will', 'be', 'associated', 'original.I', 'could', 'not', 'watch', 'new', 'version', 'thinking', 'original', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'appreciate', 'so', 'much.The', 'casting', 'very', 'good', 'Walhberg', 'indeed', 'good', 'actor', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'was', 'somehow', 'miscast', 'beautiful', 'female', ""'savage"", 'turned', 'Walhberg', 'side-kick.She', 'too', 'distractingly', 'beautiful', 'fresh', 'be', 'intended', 'character', 'expected', 'whenever', 'was', 'close', 'advertise', 'shampoo', 'beauty', 'product.The', 'make', 'up', 'great', 'DVD', 'packed', 'extras.Yet', 'something', 'missing', 'film', 'sheer', 'power', 'philosophical', 'undertones', 'harshness', 'apocalyptic', 'atmosphere', 'first.Although', 'Burton', 'ending', 'film', 'quite', 'clever', 'somehow', 'bit', 'polished', 'have', 'same', 'power', 'scene', 'confronted', 'Heston', 'viewers', 'first', 'Planet', 'Apes.You', 'can', 'certainly', 'still', 'enjoy', 'film', 'only', 'manage', 'not', 'think', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'something', 'found', 'very', 'hard', 'do', 'reason', 'was', 'disappointed', 'hope', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'industry', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'rethink', 'strategy', 'method', 'whenever', 'remake', 'adapt', 'film', 'classic', 'Dr', 'Zhivago', 'was', 'recently', 'remade', 'British', 'TV', 'flopped', 'instantly', '..and', 'remember', 'indeed', 'extremely', 'hard', 'task']",N/A
541053,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00003CXXU,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","The biggest problem with this Tim Burton inspired remake is the beginning and the end.  The middle is pretty decent.  The film opens on a space station that is experimenting with chimps as pilots in some deep space probing.  One chimp is sent into one of those ominous clouds we always saw on ""Star Trek"".  When he loses communication, our hero, Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) disobeys the commanding officer and flies out after him.  Yeah right.  The writers couldn't even keep the original name of the main character.  Leo is somehow better?  Anyway, once Leo inevitably crashes on an unknown planet, he is immediately caught up in a mob scene where humans are being rounded up by apes on horses.  These humans don't do much to resist or contribute to the movie for that matter.  Estella Warren plays a honey-haired Daena who has eyes for Leo but based on their lack of chemistry, I suspect it's just procreation on her mind.  Leo does strike up a bond with a couple of the more liberal apes.  Primarily Ari, nicely played by Helena Bonham Carter in spite of monkey make-up that makes her look like Paula Abdul.  Ari also has eyes for Leo and my guess is that Wahlberg's character is supposed to reciprocate.  Unfortunately while Carter delivers a convincing performance, Wahlberg is a cold fish throughout.  Too bad, I liked the angle.  This middle section has a goodly amount of action, chills and thrills which leads to a less than satisfactory conclusion.  Most notable in this remake, is the performance of Tim Roth as bad-ass ape, General Thade.  He is a take-no-prisoner kind of military man.  Roth's mimicking and expressions are first rate.  It's enough to make the movie watchable.  The end comes of course and it is here the bad taste in your mouth will linger.

541055,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,B00003CXXU,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[11, 13]","Planet of the Apes is the remake of the 1968 blockbuster and sci-fi classic.  I read all the criticisms that this movie absorbed prior to seeing it, so I was pre-warned you could say.  But I like Burton, I think he's put together some original and well thought out films.  However, the critics were right this time: this film sucks.  As much as I compliment the exteriors of this film (costuming, Special effects, and visual pleasures) it's one hollow movie that lacks character development and interest.Let's see, what should I rip first?  Let's begin with Wahlburg, a poor excuse of an actor.  He has no personality, none.  No emotion, no believability, no interesting monologues, nothing.  He's just there and we're forced to follow him.  Heston's character Taylor is the ultimate model of character development.  Here was a man who wanted to journey through space because he believed there was something out there better than man.  By the end of the movie, he shows some human pride.  Nothing like this is attempted through Wahlburg, other than some anti-zoo message.How about the other characters?  Tim Roth is fine as an evil general Thade who hates man, but no true explanation is given as to why.  Unlike Dr. Zaius in the first one, who had plenty of reasons why he hated man, Thade just hates just to hate.  Thade is also a bit over the top with his hatred, making him a mad ape irrational half the time.Estella who?  Talk about a pointless character.  She served no purpose, talked like a typical Californian beach babe with air between the ears, and was primarily used to show skin and rub Wahlburg's shoulders.  Nova, in the original, served as Heston's talk outlet, even though she never said a word back; sort of like a living &quot;Wilson&quot; in &quot;Cast Away.&quot;  Warren wasn't even this, just eye candy.Let's talk about the sequences of the film.  Like in the original, the main character is captured.  He is made a slave in Ape society.  But while he's a slave we learn very little of Ape society, unlike the original, which did a masterful job portraying this &quot;upside down&quot; society from every corner.  In this version, it doesn't take the time, we get the feeling that the society is just ran by military powers such as Thade and that's all there is to it.In the first one humans were dominated by apes because humans couldn't speak and they lacked intelligence.  In this one the humans are quite intelligent, so why are they so inferior to Apes?  Why are the humans so far behind if they have verbal communications and tend to display plenty of intelligence?  No explanation is given in the film.  Again, Burton did not take the time to explain this world and its society which leaves holes unfilled and thereby creates dis-satisfaction.Also unlike the original, where Heston attempted to survive by being confined within ape society, Wahlburg's character is trying to survive by running from ape society.  So we don't learn first hand about this society, we can't grow with the character because through most of the film he's running away from Attar and Thade.  This is a disaster of a film.And then, the worst, is the ending.  It makes no sense by the way, no explanation, just ends abruptly with no irony.What made Planet of the Apes, the original, so successful was not its make-up or costuming or what have you.  What made it successful was its storyline and ironic sequences that made us sympathize with the main character and learn of an entirely different, yet not so different society.  This film did not of that.  It was an average sci-fi film that lacks an original story, original characters, development of plot and characters, and memorable events within the movie.  Tim Burton failed at all these points.  This film is a shambles and those of you who think this film is something grand, haven't got a clue what hard work combined with good story telling is until you've appreciated the effort and pay off of the original.",2,Planet of sour grapes,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,3973,"['Planet', 'Apes', 'remake', '1968', 'blockbuster', 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'read', 'criticisms', 'movie', 'absorbed', 'prior', 'seeing', 'was', 'pre-warned', 'could', 'say', 'like', 'Burton', 'think', 'put', 'together', 'original', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'films', 'However', 'critics', 'were', 'right', 'time', 'film', 'As', 'much', 'compliment', 'exteriors', 'film', 'costuming', 'Special', 'effects', 'visual', 'pleasures', 'one', 'hollow', 'movie', 'character', 'development', 'interest.Let', 'see', 'what', 'should', 'rip', 'first', 'Let', 'begin', 'Wahlburg', 'poor', 'excuse', 'actor', 'personality', 'none', 'emotion', 'believability', 'interesting', 'monologues', 'nothing', 'just', 'there', ""'re"", 'forced', 'follow', 'Heston', 'character', 'Taylor', 'ultimate', 'model', 'character', 'development', 'Here', 'was', 'man', 'who', 'wanted', 'journey', 'space', 'believed', 'was', 'something', 'there', 'better', 'man', 'end', 'movie', 'human', 'pride', 'Nothing', 'attempted', 'Wahlburg', 'other', 'anti-zoo', 'message.How', 'other', 'characters', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'fine', 'evil', 'general', 'Thade', 'who', 'man', 'true', 'explanation', 'given', 'why', 'Dr.', 'Zaius', 'first', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'plenty', 'reasons', 'why', 'hated', 'man', 'Thade', 'just', 'just', 'hate', 'Thade', 'also', 'bit', 'top', 'hatred', 'making', 'mad', 'ape', 'irrational', 'time.Estella', 'who', 'Talk', 'pointless', 'character', 'served', 'purpose', 'talked', 'typical', 'Californian', 'beach', 'babe', 'air', 'ears', 'was', 'primarily', 'used', 'show', 'skin', 'rub', 'Wahlburg', 'shoulders', 'Nova', 'original', 'served', 'Heston', 'talk', 'outlet', 'even', 'never', 'said', 'word', 'back', 'sort', 'living', 'quot', 'Wilson', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cast', 'Away.', 'quot', 'Warren', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'just', 'eye', 'candy.Let', 'talk', 'sequences', 'film', 'original', 'main', 'character', 'captured', 'made', 'slave', 'Ape', 'society', 'slave', 'learn', 'very', 'little', 'Ape', 'society', 'original', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'portraying', 'quot', 'quot', 'society', 'corner', 'version', ""n't"", 'take', 'time', 'get', 'feeling', 'society', 'just', 'ran', 'military', 'powers', 'such', 'Thade', 'it.In', 'first', 'one', 'humans', 'were', 'dominated', 'apes', 'humans', 'could', ""n't"", 'speak', 'lacked', 'intelligence', 'one', 'humans', 'are', 'quite', 'intelligent', 'so', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'inferior', 'Apes', 'Why', 'are', 'humans', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'verbal', 'communications', 'tend', 'display', 'plenty', 'intelligence', 'explanation', 'given', 'film', 'Again', 'Burton', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'time', 'explain', 'world', 'society', 'holes', 'unfilled', 'thereby', 'creates', 'dis-satisfaction.Also', 'original', 'where', 'Heston', 'attempted', 'survive', 'being', 'confined', 'ape', 'society', 'Wahlburg', 'character', 'trying', 'survive', 'running', 'ape', 'society', 'do', ""n't"", 'learn', 'first', 'hand', 'society', 'ca', ""n't"", 'grow', 'character', 'most', 'film', 'running', 'away', 'Attar', 'Thade', 'disaster', 'film.And', 'then', 'worst', 'ending', 'sense', 'way', 'explanation', 'just', 'abruptly', 'irony.What', 'made', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'original', 'so', 'successful', 'was', 'not', 'make-up', 'costuming', 'what', 'have', 'What', 'made', 'successful', 'was', 'storyline', 'ironic', 'sequences', 'made', 'sympathize', 'main', 'character', 'learn', 'entirely', 'different', 'yet', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'society', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'was', 'average', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'original', 'story', 'original', 'characters', 'development', 'plot', 'characters', 'memorable', 'events', 'movie', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'failed', 'points', 'film', 'shambles', 'who', 'think', 'film', 'something', 'grand', 'have', ""n't"", 'got', 'clue', 'what', 'hard', 'work', 'combined', 'good', 'story', 'telling', ""'ve"", 'appreciated', 'effort', 'pay', 'off', 'original']",N/A

I love the original POTA film as it was full of great characters who really gave it their all to make the apes believable. In this remake only actor gets it right, Paul Giamatti! He has a lot of fun with his role and I wish the other actors would have taken a cue from him. One of the cool things about the original is that they were able to get great actors with very distinctive voices to play the major apes roles. This made a huge difference to me and made the apse have great character.All that was good in the original has been removed from the story in this weak remake including the controversial social commentary which made the original a classic. This could have been brillant, but it ends up being a worthless piece of trash that is not worth the space it takes up on your DVD shelf! Rick Baker's makeup is great, but somehow I still prefer the original look of the apes. It's like the shark in Jaws, they may be able to make it look more realisic now, but the original shark is just scary as H E L L !Maybe they should have let Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron do the remake?.... at least they would have had some fun with it. I am a Burton fan, but this is a total mess! Making the humans talk was just one of the mistakes made in this clunker and it just gets worse. The apes in the original are civilized to a certain extent and were not doing anything to the humans that we had not done to them in our time. The apes in the remake are just plain mean and cruel with no real separation between the differnent species. In the original, Taylor was someone who hated humans and had given up on the human race, it was so ironic that he would end up on this upside down planet.I could go on and on about what went wrong with this remake, but I would be here until ""DOOMSDAY""(heh heh).....I know that line is from the the second movie. I watched it twice in a two day period just to make sure it was as bad as I thought the first time!.....it is!If you want to see some remakes that were done right watch The Thing, The Fly or King Kong (2005)They may not be better than the originals, but they do add something new to the story and make it worth viewing.",1,HORRIBLE!

541057,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00003CXXU,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 2]","Since Tim Burton arrived on the movie scene with Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, as a film-maker he has often  been described as inconsistent and his remake of Planet Of The Apes has taken some flak. Personally, I loved Batman Returns and Ed Wood but was very disappointed with Batman. Despite the critical mauling, I also think Mars Attacks is a fabulous black comedy, although Sleepy Hollow was in my view (although sumptuous in appearance) relatively average by the great auteur's high standards. So what of his ""re-imagining"" of Planet Of The Apes?Seeking his chimpanzee and contrary to his superior's orders, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) travels through a wormhole in space and crash lands on a planet populated by both apes and humans but where the apes rule and the enslaved humans are treated as filthy animals. Soon captured, Leo quickly comes to the attention of the evil General Thade (an excellent Tim Roth), who instantly recognizes Leo as a threat to ape kind and sets out to destroy him. However, Leo, accompanied by two fellow human slaves (Kris Kristofferson and the voluptuous Estella Warren) and aided by the peace-loving primate Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) they flee the ape city, hotly pursued by General Thade and his ape army.The special effects and make up are absolutely top-notch and no effort has been spared in attention to detail. The script is more than passable and has more than the odd nudge and a wink at both the original movie and an ironic view of our own modern society, the way that we treat animals and each other. Interestingly however, unlike the original perhaps, it is the actors behind the fur that excel in this movie. Helenah Bonham Carter (Fight Club) is once again successfully cast against type as a possible love interest and Charlton Heston gives a nice cameo performance, whilst Tim Roth revels in the opportunity of playing a ruthlessly ambitious, evil and murderous primate. Meanwhile of the humans, Mark Wahlberg (a surprising choice for this role) perhaps could have been more charismatic and Estelle Warren just has to look pretty and occasionally pout, although they all give passable performances. The film perhaps lulls in places but overall it does maintain its hold on its audience and although the ending has been the subject of much debate and negative comment, personally I liked it, didn't think it was that ambiguous and feel it sets us up nicely for a sequel.Remaking such a famous and much-loved movie was always likely to divide opinion. I like many adored the original (but despised the dross that was the sequels) and my expectations for this movie were very high.

Once again the Hollywood cookie-cutter seems to have been in use.Unlike some other reviews of this - to my mind if it was based on the same original novel and it's called the same thing, then it's a remake. Call it what you want, that's what it is, and there are bound to be comparisons to the original.A lot of thought very evidently went into the look and feel of the movie. It looked fantastic and the cinematography was excellent. Unfortunately, as has been the case in the past few years with films of this type, very little thought seems to have been put into the plot or the script. The direction seemed to be lacking more than a little, to the effect of having Tim Roth snarl at the beginning and end of almost every line of dialog. Mark Wahlberg looked to be completely out of his depth, and turned in a poor performance.The story was loose almost to the point of non-existence, and as for the ending .... There were rumours that several endings had been produced, and, well, if that was the best of them I'd love to see the others just for the sheer comedic value.I was very disappointed with this effort, and expected more from Tim Burton and Tim Roth.

I was well entertained.Being familiar with the original Planet of the Apes, staring Charleton Heston, I found myself comparing the two and looking expectantly for the Statue of Liberty scene at the end. Along the way it finally dawned on me that this movie ought to be viewed as a unique film experience. It should be viewed on its own merit alone, and totally apart from its predecessor. When judged on its own merits, the film is fun, clever and enjoyable.The make-up artistry provided by Rick Baker, master of the genre, is wonderful. The effort put forth by the cast to learn ape behavior and movement shows throughout. The special effects are splendid. One particular example that i found entertaining was a scene that can best be described as ape &quot;foreplay&quot; that is interrupted by the escape of our hero and his entourage. Another was the alarm of the female ape when confronted by water and the propsect of swimming.I found this film entirely entertaining, artistically competent, and entirely believable. I enjoyed the film, have watched it several times, and will likely watch it again myself and with friends.

I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". Here's how I would have written it:An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.",2,"It's a madhouse!!

Another typical Burton caricature production which seems more like something prepared as advertisement for a McDonald's Happy Meal promotional toy collection.The story now takes place on some distant planet instead of Earth where Mark Wahlberg lands by accident while conducting a chimp-pilot experiment. Trapped on what becomes a hostile ape planet, he gets help from good apes to fight the bad ones. Predictable plot, no character depth, and no real story worth pondering over; only a poorly directed bubble-gum film prepared for mass-consumption and aimed at your pubescent audience. I give it two stars only because the special effects were very well done.  All of the satirical elements present in Rod Serling's original script have been removed to leave nothing of worth except stupid anachnronisms, placid human faces, and a simply atrocious screenplay.

Planet of the Apes was marketed as something ""new"" but all parts of it were stolen from classic science fiction films from the 1950's. Bascially there is no plot in this film and if you were a European director, it wouldn't matter but Burton has the capabilities of a 12 year old teen and those qualities are evident here.He uses ""movements"" from the first film (ex: the apes catching a human with a neck container) which are part of our collective conscience except this time around, there is no energy in them. The cartoonish film has terrible sets, which look like some cheap soap opera and there is no realist sustainabilty. The characters walk around the same sound set covered with plastic ferns and trees and it seems like they are going nowhere, even worse is the 'ape city' which is so ridiculous that one doesn't even think that it is populated. Problem after problem punctuates what we see. Walhberg is so boring as a rebellious captain that he doesn't seem real but the ""humans"" are worshipping him as a leader? Give us a break.The humans themselves are ludicrious, because they are clean, and have a perfect communication skill and the women are half naked with big breasts. Ghee Tim, are you trying to market your film to horny 11 year olds? What else? Everything, uneven acting, even worse, cliche that puts us to sleep.

A little more effort in filling in plot holes would have been nice though, although the ending (spoiler warning) was made as it was to spawn a sequel, it was annoying to have had them miss out on the opportunity to make an ""Aperaham Lincoln"" gag, which was of course mighty frustrating. The thing that annoyed me most about the film was that the humans could speak, for me, the original 1968 film had Charlton Heston's main shocking capacity to the apes, was not that he was a spaceman, but that he could talk. By having everyone being able to talk, it immediately robs Leo Davidson's character of the one thing that would have made him uniquely interesting and that bothers me. The idea that the apes and humans had originated from the crashed ruins of the Oberon was another rather elegant plot twist that impressed me, the fact that the crew reported that the revolting apes had overcome them was a little paradox however, it would have been better if the computer log had said that they were abandoning the wreckage of the ship (or the ship, I am unclear if it had crashed before the ape mutiny) and going off to found a colony somewhere. And where did the horses come from? Don't tell me that on the Oberon, the apes were doing the exploration, and presumably the horses were in charge of repairing the ship or something? A little more care and thought would have made this a decent film, but even so, it really not that bad, I enjoyed watching it for the second time (after seeing at the flicks in 2002) more than I thought I would. And one last thing, as if a big mighty gorilla would less an tiny chimp boss him around.

541074,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00003CXXU,Paul McGrath,"[124, 170]","You asked for it, you got it, seems to be the Hollywood credo these days, as it unleashes yet another bloated and unimaginative monstrosity on our increasingly docile and sheeplike public.  Believe me, I'm getting tired of being so negative, but how else is one supposed to react?  What do you call a film that intentionally, studiously, and almost cleverly avoids being smart?  What is the word for this?  Well, moronic comes to mind.  If not, then manipulative, or maybe cynical.Now I understand that this is a science fiction movie and I understand that when I hear these words in combination with one another I must suspend my disbelief to some extent.  But one of these words is ""science,"" okay?  So, in theory anyway, is it not reasonable to expect a certain semblance to reality?  Why is this so difficult?The trouble begins pretty quickly, almost as soon as our hero gets to the ape planet.  He runs into both apes and humans immediately, and after toying with us for several minutes, the filmmakers finally allow us to hear that the humans in this world can speak.  Whoa!  This is a significant departure from both the novel and the first movie, which both portrayed humans as merely dumb animals.  In this one, they are intelligent.  How were they going to reconcile this with their obviously subservient status?The answer is, they don't.  How did these intelligent human beings get into this state?  In fact, what is their state?  Where do they live?  What do they live in?  What do they eat?  Do they cook?  How do they clothe themselves?  We never see.  We know nothing, except that they appear out of the forest one day, and speak relatively educated English with one another.  What is going on here?  I guess we're not supposed to know, and apparently, the filmmakers don't believe that we care.  This is what is known as intellectual laziness, and it is infuriating.What is really going on is that the filmmakers wanted the space human and the ape-world humans to be able to communicate with one another, quickly, and they didn't care about the huge plot complications that arose because of it.  They ignored it.  But this is like ignoring, if you will excuse me, the eight-hundred pound gorilla in the corner.  From any standpoint you care to look at it--anthropological, biological or even political--the brave new world they have created makes no sense.So they abandoned common sense everywhere.  Take the apes.  They have obviously discovered steel, but for some reason--even though they are a very warlike society--they haven't discovered swords or spears or shields, or for that matter, even bows and arrows.  Instead, they use heavy club-like devices--so they can pummel each other in an apelike fashion--and slings.  They are obsessed by the human problem.  They discuss nothing else.  Some want to kill the humans and some advocate living with them peacefully.  This is kind of interesting, but again, is this all there is?  As humans have apparently been completely subjugated and are practically helpless, why should they care this much?And they are afraid of water!  Terrified even, although they live in an area which is lush with jungly vegetation, has at least two large lakes, and is seemingly darkened by clouds most of the time.  How can a creature which requires water to survive be in terror of it?  It makes no sense, except that soon enough we see the movie-maker's reason for it:  a very clumsy plot device, and one which easily could have been circumvented with even a little imagination.  Again, they don't seem to care.As the film continues we find out that the explanation for the ape society is that it was founded by--a chimpanzee.  Yes, a chimp.  A monkey.  But haven't the apes been ridiculing monkeys all along?  And how, pray tell, does an ape descend from a monkey anyway?  HOW?Nope, they don't care to explain, and this, in a nutshell, is what plagues major Hollywood filmmaking today:  the thought and intelligence behind these projects is used entirely to go into the creation of special effects, and is completely uncaring as to the story it purports to tell.  The first film, as well as making sense from a plot standpoint, was also truly thought-provoking:  our inhumane treatment of dumb brutes as exemplified by our being put in their place;  the question of the origin of society and the belief in a superior being;  and even racial divisions among the apes themselves are issues that were explored.  But in this movie, any thought--and even a rational plot--is subsumed by realistic-looking gorilla costumes;  lots of fighting in the new-age, leaping-around, karate-kicking way;  amplified growls and shrieks;  and wild rides in a colorful outer space.  That's it.I myself was bored beyond belief, and appalled by the preposterous, ridiculous ending.  I left the theatre feeling insulted that the makers of films like this apparently think that we can be bought so cheaply.  But who cares?Judging from the first weekend's box-office receipts, the filmmakers sure don't.  Why should they?  Sad.

541076,AYWIO6OYAGFGQ,B00003CXXU,"pm444 ""pm444""","[1, 1]","I'm surprised that the response to this film has been almost hostile in some quarters.  Granted, there was too much hype, but so what?  If it had been quietly released at some other time of year, would that make its flaws more acceptable?First, the things most viewers and critics seem to like:  the make-up, costumes, and simian movements are well-done.  I liked the fact that you could glimpse the real actor under the ape-faces, especially with Helena Bonham Carter.  It makes them less like cut-out characters wearing ape-masks, and allowed their personalities to come through.  The ape-actors walked, ran, and leapt around in a distinctly non-human way, too.The sets were extremely elaborate and as always with Burton, there were some stunning scenarios (the first glimpse of the ape-city and the red tents on the beach, for example).  That said, I did find the generally sunless, gray skies to be monotonous and dreary.  The sun finally came out for the big battle scene, but if that was supposed to be symbolic, it was overdone.My main objection to the movie was that about two-thirds of the way through, the action really lagged.  This was after Mark Wahlberg and his band escaped from the ape-city.  I thought Wahlberg accurately portrayed his character as emotionally uninvolved and remote;  that was the way the script was written, and critics who pan him for his so-called &quot;flat&quot; performance are misdirecting their objections.However, it was inconsistent for him to be seen roaming around on his own, apparently in deep thought.  It did not fit his character, and needlessly slowed down the pace of the film. With some tight editing at this point, the movie would have been better (and shorter... directors should produce an alternate, shorter edit of any film 2 hours or longer, then show both versions to a preview audience.

541086,A1J2931UBBJPXM,B00003CXXU,Reviewer,"[1, 3]","After the original film of the same title and it&#65533;s numerous sequels, you have to ask the question, did the world really need another version?  Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it&#65533;s kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can&#65533;t recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is.  And &#65533;Planet of the Apes&#65533; couldn&#65533;t have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn&#65533;t make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true.  It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we&#65533;ve been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good.  But does being able to showcase make-up and F/X wizards justify resurrecting this one?  I guess the bottom line is, this movie&#65533;s going to make a killing at the box office.It all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things.  One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before.  He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he&#65533;s some four to five hundred years into the future.  He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans.  And it&#65533;s then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here.  Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything.  He readily discerns that there doesn&#65533;t seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor:  He runs.  And the adventure begins in earnest.If this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director&#65533;s chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with &#65533;Batman,&#65533; &#65533;Sleepy Hollow&#65533; and &#65533;Edward Scissorhands&#65533; (just to name a few).  But there just isn&#65533;t that much story here.  It&#65533;s an incredible journey, to be sure, but it&#65533;s just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets.  And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the &#65533;Cha-ching!&#65533; of the cash register.As the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn&#65533;t a role that required much emoting.  Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his.  He did and it was.  And to his credit, he did it very well.  Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get.  No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn&#65533;t make any difference.  He&#65533;s the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that&#65533;s all you have to know.Helena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them.  Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration.  You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant/Ivory made &#65533;Gorillas In the Mist.&#65533;As General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he&#65533;s played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston.  Taken at face value for the action/adventure film it is, &#65533;Planet of the Apes&#65533; is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium.  For what it is, it&#65533;s well made and delivered; it just seems that the talent involved with this project could have been better served elsewhere.",3,Sometimes You Have To Ask Yourself A

But first let me say that this film as conceived is not a remake of the 1968 film, as simply another telling of the Pierre Boule original novel.That said, this film departs from the book more than the first film, with the exception of the surprise ending. The ending of this book is meant to shock, and does, although it's nothing like the ending of the first film.In this film, however, the ape actors improve over the originals by being more ape-like (I credit this to the director, Tim Burton, not really to the actors, I must add). They shriek and laugh in ape voices-- that is, the vocalizations sound just like real wild apes. Also, these apes don't walk as efficiently as humans; they have a splayed-hip walk that looks just like chimpanzees when they walk bi-pedally. The apes here also brachiate, an ape behavior missing in the original film, which goes miles to develop characters.This is a good science fiction yarn, with excellent effects. It's also a touching allegory for race relations, and for human treatment of simians.Marky Mark Wahlberg is the earth human stranded on the ape planet. Wahlberg is not an acting powerhouse, but he's playing a stoic military officer, with a singular focus on getting home, not at all interested in the implications of talking, thinking apes. Wahlberg manages to pull this off admirably. It may be that this role touched the limits of his ability, but since the role doesn't requires much subtlety, Wahlberg is up to it.Helena Bonham-Carter is unrecognizable as the sympathetic young ape, who believes in the unpopular idea of human-ape equality. This role requires much finesse, subtlety and raw talent. Signing Bonham-Carter for the role was a casting coup. Even if the film failed on all other points, it would still be watchable for her performance. I wish she'd won an Oscar.Don't let this film compete in your mind with the '68 version, so that loyalty to the earlier film makes you want to dislike this film.

First, the corny moments-- references to the original movie which just fall flat as humor or tributes (though the scene where Wahlberg's character kisses the female chimp who befriends him is a clever and unexpected turn on the original), then the monumentally stupid scene at the climax of the ape/human battle when the space chimp comes down, and the apes stop the battle to genuflect.  This was supposed to the dramatic climax of the movie, for crying out loud!  Compare that with the climactic scene in the '68 version, and you'll see how this one falls short.  Also, the plot is way to predictable -- I had the end figured out within the first five minutes of the movie -- although, to the movie's credit, it does explain why there would be an alien world with human beings, chimps, orangutans, and gorillas.  There are some good ideas in the movie, and also on the plus side, I've always wanted to the see the final scene in this movie on film since reading the original novel, from whence the scene originates.  But overall, this movie has none of the drama, tension, and memorable dialogue from the original.  Maybe it was the lack of memorable dialogue in the script that prompted them to re-use the most memorable lines from the original in new contexts.

When Leo and the other humans escape their ape masters they race to the forbidden desert, and the plot thickens with fantastic twists and a ending that was as shocking as the original. Tim Roth's role as evil, angry General Thade was simply magnificent, and his talk with his dying father (played by Charlton Heston) was one of the high points of the film.

541098,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00003CXXU,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","""Planet of the Apes"" is a joyless, soulless and utterly pointless remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic.  The original film had two strong elements going for it:  its expansive visual style and its playful spirit.  Both qualities have been effectively eliminated in Tim Burton's update, along with the sense of wonder that came, thirty-three years ago, when the material was still innovative and fresh.  What viewer can forget the time he first saw that stunning final shot of the earlier version, with a weary Charlton Heston coming upon the remains of the Statue of Liberty - then bellowing in outrage at the tragic reality hitherto unrevealed to both him and us?  Burton, not wanting to be a slavish devotee to the original (and not wanting the audience to know everything about the story in advance of entering the theatre), attempts a similar ""surprise"" ending here, but the execution of it is so ludicrous, confused and clumsy that all one can do is scratch one's head and giggle in bemused befuddlement.Much of the effectiveness of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" lay in its deliberately paced buildup.  The early stretches of the film, in which Heston and his fellow astronauts wandered the desert in search of life, helped immensely in generating an atmosphere of suspense and mystery.  In the new version, however, the lone hero, Thade (Mark Wahlberg), crash lands on the planet and, almost instantaneously, finds himself caught in this strange world in which evolution seems to have taken a reverse course, where apes speak and have dominion over docile humans - though they're not quite as docile as they were in the first version since in this edition the humans speak, rendering absurd the idea that the apes would consider humans to be a subspecies.Also, in the original version, much of the time was spent focusing on Heston's attempts to convince the apes that he was every bit as smart as they were.  Thus, much of the pleasure of the film came from the fact that there seemed to be a duel of wits going on between apes and humans - a contest that often took the form of high-spirited, clever and even witty dialogue exchanges.  For all the ludicrousness of its premise, the original ""Planet of the Apes"" was not a DUMB movie.  I wish one could say the same for the remake.  The plotting in this version essentially boils down to little more than an extended and distended chase story, with apes racing madly after humans from one dimly lit locale to the next.And here we come upon another problem with the movie - one it shares with many modern action flicks, actually, especially those made by Burton.  It is simply shot too dark.  One of the qualities that distinguished the original film from most of the sci-fi adventure films that came before it was the near-epic feeling created by its beautiful wide screen images of the desert setting.  These shots lent a visual impressiveness to the potentially childish material and helped to bring an aura of seriousness to the proceedings.  In Burton's version, however, the visual style is often dark, cramped and confining, not at all conducive to the sense of majesty and awe that Franklin Schaffner's version afforded.Wahlberg is a bland substitute for Heston who, dressed only in a loincloth and hissing virtually every line through clenched teeth, seemed to sense the camp potential hidden beneath the story's surface - a fact not acknowledged by the stolid Wahlberg (or by Burton for that matter).  How we miss the charming personalities of Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter as the sympathetic ape characters.  Poor Helena Bonham Carter, in the Hunter role, doesn't get to recite even one vaguely amusing line.It seems amazing that a movie made thirty-three years ago would take itself so much less seriously than a film made today.  One would expect that a filmmaker like Burton, known for his ability to find humor in the most macabre of situations, would be the last director to take such a humorless, deadpan approach to material like this.  The original ""Planet of the Apes"" managed to combine the elements of originality, suspense, humor, irony, surprise and visual acuity to create a work of lasting value and interest.

There are many possible reasons but even remakes of quality--which this one is--are merely plowing old ground.  Another way of putting this is that the 'jolt' of the original film has dissipated and, no matter the quality of the second film, the surprise is absent.From the original film we have already learned that our astronaut has been propelled into a future earth in which apes are intelligent and dominant and humans are bestial fit only for game or slaves.  It's an interesting idea--ONCE.The present film does have some improvements over the first, however.  The ape make-up is better as is their hybrid behavior.  Humans aren't quite so bestial.  Some, at least, appear reasonably intelligent, talk, and even wear woven clothing.  This film, however, makes some of the same mistakes as the original 'Planet'.  The intelligent apes are of three different species--chimps, gorillas, orangutans.  Only gibbons are missing.  If by some evolutionary accident apes became the dominant intelligent life form on earth, only one species of ape is likely to become significantly intelligent.  Other apes would likely remain animalistic.  Why?  It's simply the way evolution works.  It would be extraordinarily unlikely that 3 quite separate species would--lock-step--take the same evolutionary path to intelligence at the same time.Perhaps that's not the point.

The orginal is still more technically experimental (aren't all 70s Hollywood films more experimental than their sucessors), Jerry Goldsmith atonal score still kicks, Elfman's is more &quot;dramatic&quot; in a trad Hollywood kind of way but still &quot;out&quot; when compared to John Williams or today's Goldsmith.The makeup save for their attempt to prettify Helena Bonham Carter's character is amazing.

This movie has a pulpy, funny spirit that is given an infinitely lighter touch than the original.  It seems built for a family audience; the thrills are all G-rated, and, except for a menacing Tim Roth, who is absolutely terrific in the pivotal role of General Thade, there is little real violence and no visible bloodshed.  The true charge of the original's topsy-turvy world, where apes hunted men (who were truly savages) was in its hair-raising &quot;realness&quot;, and thinly disguised substitute for racial tension.  Despite the advanced makeup and special effects, and the fact that the apes move like real apes, this movie has a different viewpoint altogether.  It is much more of a devilish comic book that pays a winking homage to the original, but is not concerned at all with the bigger themes.  And you know what?  It is completely fun and delightful.  The much-talked about new surprise ending has its own peculiar merits.  The whole affair has a sunny, retro affectionate feel that is energized and silly  -- the ape characters have comic-book-sized personalities that will resonate with kids; Mark Wahlberg is cute, if dumb -- but do not go expecting a serious sci-fi movie like the original or you will be sorely disappointed.

The remake of Apes was long in development; reportedly, James Cameron tried, but the project ended up in Burton's merciless hands.  It would have been a monumental challenge to outdo the 1968 original; currently, there are no screenwriters with the intelligence or dark wit of Rod Serling, no leading men with the presence of Charlton Heston, nor film composers like Jerry Goldsmith at his height.  Even the supporting cast puts today's Central Casting to shame.  Nor do we live in the chaotically creative era of 1968.  All of this might have made us sympathize with the director if only he made a film with an iota of insight about the state of civilization in his time, but his opus is as gruesomely lobotomized as Landon was in the first feature.  The remake is important insofar as it shows us that our cinematic culture - if not our culture at large - is profoundly devolving.Comparing the original to the remake is painfully illustrative of how small we've become.  Whereas the original attacks human hubris, eviscerating every exalted tenet of our civilization - particularly the validity of religion itself - the remake offers no themes which are timely, ironic or profound.  We haven't seen a science fiction film used effectively for savage satire since 1986's ""Robocop.""  In an effort to draw in the greatest number of viewers, the remake's creators have striven to make it as inoffensive as possible.

The music by Danny Elfman is quite impressive, even touching upon the original's percussive score.

This &quot;re-imaging&quot; was so vastly inferior to that, that it's a wonder the script ever got greenlit to begin with. I had heard that the film was bad, but I liked the original so much I rented it when it came out on video anyway. What a mistake.I didn't simply dislike this version because I'm a fan of the original, it is truely a horrible horrible film. The script is pathetic and the ending seems like it was made by someone under the influence of heavy narcotics who didn't care about whether it made sense or fit into the movie or not.This film is almost ridiculously campy with the bad dialogue and lines thrown into it simply to elicit a slight grin based on a connection from the first film. I think they added a bunch of scenes just so they could have something cool to say on the commentary track and in magazine interviews.  The apes act ridiculous and you're never left with the feeling that this could actually happen given the absurd things they do. I'm surprised Burton didn't throw in a monkey car that runs on bananas or something. There's even a little dwarf that runs around collecting money like a chimpanzee would do at the circus.Even if they took all the &quot;ape camp&quot; out, it's still a pathetic movie. Mainly because of the script and the horrible directing by Burton. The stunts look pretty bad and fake. Many things don't make sense, like why apes would ride horses if they can move faster than horses anyway. Even Wahlberg gives a pathetic performance.The only entertainment value in this entire movie is the &quot;funny&quot; things that an ape society does that compare with what humans do. The only redeeming thing about renting this trash was that it was the best sounding DVD I've ever heard, and REALLY gave my 5.1 surround system a work. Almost worth the rent to check it out until some better DVDs come along that have sound work as good.  The DVD also is fairly packed with extras.

The movie was rushed on most of Mark's scenes (perhaps to add to suspense, i don't know).

I just didn't like the pacing, too fast and random.  The characters that got time to reveal their characteristics were Thade and a bit of Helena's character.

I can't tell about it because that may spoil the movie (if it has not been spoiled already).The sets were cool and the Ape outfits and masks were pretty sweet.  I liked the digital work on the mouths when they roared, looked good.  This movie also did a different thing than from the origianl.

After all, who could replace Roddy McDowall?Tim Burton pays homage to the original by adding special effects that were beyond the technology and beyond the budget of the original films. If you've seen other Tim Burton films, especially &quot;Ed Wood,&quot; you know that he has tremendous respect for the originals and classics... and his intent is to compliment, not replace the original &quot;Ape&quot; series.The make-up is superior and the spin on Burton's version allows for an explaination as to why these apes can talk, why they don't look quite like the apes we're accustomed to and why they choose to wear clothing. The original did not attempt to explain this, but using your own imagination also had its appeal.  While the make-up is superior, I missed the &quot;sweet&quot; expressions on the older generation of ape masks and prosthetics... I guess I'm old fashioned. :-)While this version does not have the appeal of the original w/ the sweet characters such as Cornelius and Zera, it was an interesting new twist that Burton didn't lock the different species into different career paths... the army isn't exclusively gorillas, and is commanded by a chimp... orangutans aren't only religious leaders, some are businessmen (aka slave traders), etc.The special effects were great and for a modern sit-and-relax while you enjoy the show kinda sci-fi, this film does a good job. I would have given this a 3.5 stars, but as that rating system is unavailable, I rounded it up.  The make-up used for Helena Bonham Carter's chimp character was pretty unrealistic, but I suppose they were trying to make a chimpanzee look as &quot;sexy&quot; as possible. The look they gave her was a bit of a disappointment.As usual, Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Clark Duncan are excellent. Roth's character as the military leader may get an Oscar nod for best supporting actor... he is the strongest element in this film. A lot of attention was given not only to make-up and prothsetics, but also to the way the actors moved in their costumes. Instead of shuffling along as they did in the old series, these characters tend to move in a more ape-like fashion.While Roth's character is shown briefly as a sympathetic character when he sees his dying father (aka Charlton Heston in an uncredited cameo appearance), the audience isn't able to feel empathy for this character and simply loathing... his counterpart (IMO) in the original series would be Dr. Zaius, the orangutan spiritual leader who continued the deception of the origin of the species as it were. While he was devious, there were still appealing elements to his character which provided more overall audience emotional involvement, which I believe this film lacks. His spin on having the planet of the Apes actually be on a planet different than earth is a good one... and how the apes ended up there is explained... but no one has explained where the horses came from... a definite hole in the plot.Tim Burton accomplishes a very difficult task... re-making a cult-classic that doesn't disgust the nolstagic, but actually entertains. The result is a definitely a fun film, but there will never be a replacement for Roddy McDowall and in the long term, this film will never evoke the nostalgic goose-bumps of the original.

Visually the film is stunning though I found some of the apes to look more fake than the original.  The storyline is devoid of any philosophical framework which we cannot say for the original.  Burton paints the apes as practically evil and devoid of humanity save one or two characters. In the original you could actually identify with the master ape race as they were 'practically human' or rather they behaved and reasoned like humans, which is how the first film began the dialectic of what it means to be human or have humanity.  Burton's film does none of this and almost seems to try and avoid it all together. Where this film really fails is in the story arc, it fails to explain itself.  Whalberg's character doesn't seem to know he has passed through time and he goes back in time to see the 20th century ruled by apes which hints to a parallel universes more than time travel however it never makes this quite clear.",3,He should have called its something else,1336867200,"05 13, 2012",2012,1107,"['decent', 'film', 'not', 'Planet', 'Apes', ""n't"", 'equal', 'surpass', 'original', 'own', 'story', 'piece', 'work', 'Burton', 'should', 'have', 'marketed', 'such', 'Visually', 'film', 'stunning', 'found', 'apes', 'look', 'more', 'fake', 'original', 'storyline', 'devoid', 'philosophical', 'framework', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'original', 'Burton', 'apes', 'practically', 'evil', 'devoid', 'humanity', 'save', 'one', 'two', 'characters', 'original', 'could', 'actually', 'identify', 'master', 'ape', 'race', 'were', ""'practically"", 'human', 'rather', 'behaved', 'reasoned', 'humans', 'how', 'first', 'film', 'began', 'dialectic', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'have', 'humanity', 'Burton', 'film', 'none', 'almost', 'try', 'avoid', 'together', 'Where', 'film', 'really', 'story', 'arc', 'explain', 'Whalberg', 'character', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'passed', 'time', 'back', 'time', 'see', '20th', 'century', 'ruled', 'apes', 'hints', 'parallel', 'more', 'time', 'travel', 'however', 'never', 'quite', 'clear']",N/A

But in my opinion, Tim Burton's 2001 remake of the classic 1968 version of Planet of the Apes was a victim of a lot of unjust criticism.Most of the criticism is from preservationists that just don't like their classics tampered with. To them I say fair enough, but I'm also here to say that as much as I loved theoriginal movie that spawned 4 sequels, a television series and an animated TV series, I liked Tim Burton's version the best. Burton's film explained how it could all be possible better than the original while at the same time adhered to the spirit of Pierre Boulle's original novel. Sure Burton took some liberties of his own too, but he also paid honorable tribute to the '68 sci-fi classic in several scenes.I think that a lot of criticism was also created by the whole time warp thing too. Jumping back and forth in time can be a difficult thing to pull off; it can be very confusing. And it is indeed confusing in Burton's remake. But ultimately it all adds up and is very cool when you finally ""get it"".Marky Mark Wahlberg also received some pans for his performance, but I thought he was great. And the apes, most notably Helena Bonham Carter, Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan & Paul Giamatti, all looked great; they were scary, amusing and the acting was excellent. The movie is action packed and thoroughly entertaining through and through. Like I said earlier, I was certainly a fan of the original, but Burton's movie to me was less of a remake of the 1968 film and more of a better adaptation of Boulle's1963 novel.I bought this movie once on DVD already all the way back in 2001; but I wouldn't hesitate to give this a try on Blu Ray and I recommend that you do too...especially if you've never seen the movie.",4,Going Ape Over a Remake,1273795200,"05 14, 2010",2010,1854,"['guess', ""'d"", 'have', 'be', 'skeptical', 'movie', 'as', 'many', '1', '2', 'star', 'reviews', '4', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'opinion', 'Tim', 'Burton', '2001', 'remake', 'classic', '1968', 'version', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'was', 'victim', 'lot', 'unjust', 'criticism.Most', 'criticism', 'preservationists', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'classics', 'tampered', 'say', 'fair', 'enough', ""'m"", 'also', 'here', 'say', 'as', 'much', 'loved', 'theoriginal', 'movie', 'spawned', '4', 'sequels', 'television', 'series', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'liked', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'version', 'best', 'Burton', 'film', 'explained', 'how', 'could', 'all', 'be', 'possible', 'better', 'original', 'while', 'same', 'time', 'adhered', 'spirit', 'Pierre', 'Boulle', 'original', 'novel', 'Sure', 'Burton', 'took', 'liberties', 'own', 'too', 'also', 'paid', 'honorable', 'tribute', ""'68"", 'sci-fi', 'classic', 'several', 'scenes.I', 'think', 'lot', 'criticism', 'was', 'also', 'created', 'whole', 'time', 'warp', 'thing', 'too', 'Jumping', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'thing', 'pull', 'off', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'confusing', 'indeed', 'confusing', 'Burton', 'remake', 'ultimately', 'up', 'very', 'cool', 'when', 'finally', 'get', '.Marky', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'also', 'received', 'pans', 'performance', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'apes', 'most', 'notably', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'looked', 'great', 'were', 'scary', 'amusing', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'movie', 'action', 'packed', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'said', 'earlier', 'was', 'certainly', 'fan', 'original', 'Burton', 'movie', 'was', 'less', 'remake', '1968', 'film', 'more', 'better', 'adaptation', ""Boulle's1963"", 'novel.I', 'bought', 'movie', 'once', 'DVD', 'already', 'way', 'back', '2001', 'would', ""n't"", 'hesitate', 'give', 'try', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'recommend', 'do', 'too', 'especially', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie']",N/A

I respect Tim Burton for not trying to do your basic remake, which consists of updated special effects but the same story. The story in this movie is entirely different than the original. Other than the fact that Apes are involved there are very few similarities. The story is well thought out and keeps you engaged throughout the movie. Tim Burton also knew that Mark Wahlberg is no Charlton Heston, so he kept his dialogue to a minimal. Actually Tim Roth and Michael Duncan Clark have more dialogue in the movie than Wahlberg does. Rick Baker does an outstanding job with the makeup, which allows the actors facial expressions to come through which is key for this type of movie. I will not ruin the ending but will tell you that it is unique and as unexpected as the first one was in 1968. Now onto the DVD, the Anamorphic transfer is flawless and the DTS 5.1 soundtrack is superb. The video shows no signs of edge enhancement, artifacting, or color bleeds. The blacks are deep and rich and all the colors are vibrant. The DTS 5.1 audio track is just awesome; it utilizes the rears and subwoofer frequently. All dialogue is focused on the center channel and is well balanced. The DVD has more special features than any other DVD to date.

For one thing, Mark Wahlberg was okay as Captain Leo Davidson, but he could have done so much more with the part.

Completely unimportant for me to provide my opinions on the acting or plot or to tell a summary of the movie.  I only focus my reviews upon the quality of the transfer of the film to Blu Ray.  I do have the Standard Def version and watched the new Blu Ray last night but this will not be a side by side comparison.VIDEO...Despite a lower than usual Mbps rate which appeared to average in the upper teens and lower twenties, the video transfer was clean throughout the film.  I saw no artifacting in any area of the film and, especially during past paced scenes where stair stepping and aliasing might show up, there was none of that either.  Film grain, which I usually notice went unnoticed for the entire film.  Even in the darker areas, scenes were unblemished by video noise or grain.  Color grading was fairly warm even in the shadow scenes and actually pretty natural.AUDIO...Any film that utilizes a lossless codec will always be superior to one that has a lossy codec.  In 'Planet of the Apes' we get a DTS MA HD 5.1 audio which provided a very transparent stage for dialogue.  I do watch on a 7.1 audio system that is fairly high end and the surrounds are nicely utilized in an encompassing manner.  There is some discreet directionality for the surrounds and plenty for your LFE channel to do.  However, the surrounds are used often but not necessarily in a discreet directional manner.  For example, the sound of horses might be coming from both the rear channels but it sounded as if the same audio was used for both and not one horse on the right and another coming in on the left.EXTRAs...Other than a commentary, which I did not listen to, there are no extras on the blu ray.  I was very disappointed in this.  There are, however, several trailers for this and other films which I hate.  It forces you to pay for a company's advertising when the disc space could have been used for even less compression of the video transfer.All in all, I am happy with the Blu Ray as the quality is excellent.

541134,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B00003CXXU,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[0, 1]","I know that remakes are often ill-received (and rightly so all too often), especially by loyalist to the original, but when I read comments on this specific remake that the oscar-winning outstanding make-up is laughable, the acting a joke (through all that make-up by top-notch actors), or that there is nothing original here, I can't help but wonder what film those folks were watching and I have to question the objectivity they may or may not have had going into this film and we all have a bias when entering a remake or a change to an established character.  I know that I had no intention of seeing, let alone liking the new James Bond, Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), but when I gave him and the film a chance, I was enormously surprised.  I think this film needs a second chance by those who so off-handly dismissed it.I agree 100% with Amazon's review and synopsis of this film.  This remake is rather inventive and original in it's own right and is far closer to the novel than the original.  The themes of racism, civil right, justice, love, and sacrifice are handled far more deeply and sincerely than the original film did although that is still an outstanding film in its own right.  Of course, the make-up in this remake is nothing less than astounding and believable by the famous Rick Bakker and completely outshines the original film.  The special effects are nothing great, but they are good.  The acting, the heart of this film in addition to its literate script, is terrific by those in the ape make-up as their voices, eyes, and gestures must mean more to resonate with the audience because of the heavy make-up used.  I do, however, agree with critics here regarding the casting of Mark Wahlberg who is rather pedestrian in this film.  He simply lacks charisma in this role and I found myself caring very little for him even as the hero in this film.An interesting twist in this film that admittedly annoyed loyalists to the original is that in this film all humans speak, which makes sense to me as why would we ""forget"" how to speak in the future when the apes take over.  While I always thought that was a silly aspect to the ape film series for none of us to talk in the future, I must admit that it does make the apes seems even crueler when they go after humans that speak.  I guess that only enhances the racism theme prevelant in all the ape films.  After all, we did, sadly enough, considered African slaves to be soul-less and a less form of humans and they were capable of speech too.  In fact, slaves owners only considered them just ""property"" and not even human.  Again, this concept of having all humans speak in this remake makes the film all the more thought-provoking.  In addition, the short-livedPlanet of the Apes: The Complete TV Seriesalso had all the humans speak.In conclusion, this is an extraordinary film and definitely not worthy of the very harsh criticism its recently received although everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.  I just think some need to give this film a second and real chance (minus the bias one may have for the original).  I highly recommend this film as an adventure, sci-fi tale, and message for its timely social commentaries.",4,Apes Rule!,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",2007,3205,"['know', 'remakes', 'are', 'often', 'ill-received', 'rightly', 'so', 'all', 'too', 'often', 'especially', 'loyalist', 'original', 'when', 'read', 'comments', 'specific', 'remake', 'oscar-winning', 'outstanding', 'make-up', 'laughable', 'acting', 'joke', 'make-up', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'nothing', 'original', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'what', 'film', 'folks', 'were', 'watching', 'have', 'question', 'objectivity', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'had', 'going', 'film', 'have', 'bias', 'when', 'entering', 'remake', 'change', 'established', 'character', 'know', 'had', 'intention', 'seeing', 'let', 'alone', 'liking', 'new', 'James', 'Bond', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'Casino', 'Royale', 'when', 'gave', 'film', 'chance', 'was', 'enormously', 'surprised', 'think', 'film', 'second', 'chance', 'who', 'so', 'off-handly', 'dismissed', 'it.I', 'agree', '100', '%', 'Amazon', 'review', 'synopsis', 'film', 'remake', 'rather', 'inventive', 'original', 'own', 'right', 'far', 'closer', 'novel', 'original', 'themes', 'racism', 'civil', 'right', 'justice', 'love', 'sacrifice', 'are', 'handled', 'far', 'more', 'deeply', 'sincerely', 'original', 'film', 'did', 'still', 'outstanding', 'film', 'own', 'right', 'course', 'make-up', 'remake', 'nothing', 'less', 'astounding', 'believable', 'famous', 'Rick', 'Bakker', 'completely', 'original', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'nothing', 'great', 'are', 'good', 'acting', 'heart', 'film', 'addition', 'literate', 'script', 'terrific', 'ape', 'make-up', 'voices', 'eyes', 'gestures', 'must', 'mean', 'more', 'resonate', 'audience', 'heavy', 'make-up', 'used', 'do', 'however', 'agree', 'critics', 'here', 'regarding', 'casting', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'who', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'film', 'simply', 'charisma', 'role', 'found', 'caring', 'very', 'little', 'even', 'hero', 'film.An', 'interesting', 'twist', 'film', 'admittedly', 'annoyed', 'loyalists', 'original', 'film', 'humans', 'speak', 'sense', 'why', 'would', 'forget', 'how', 'speak', 'future', 'when', 'apes', 'take', 'over', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'silly', 'aspect', 'ape', 'film', 'series', 'none', 'talk', 'future', 'must', 'admit', 'make', 'apes', 'even', 'crueler', 'when', 'go', 'humans', 'speak', 'guess', 'only', 'racism', 'theme', 'prevelant', 'ape', 'films', 'did', 'sadly', 'enough', 'considered', 'African', 'slaves', 'be', 'soul-less', 'less', 'form', 'humans', 'were', 'capable', 'speech', 'too', 'fact', 'owners', 'only', 'considered', 'just', 'property', 'not', 'even', 'human', 'Again', 'concept', 'having', 'humans', 'speak', 'remake', 'film', 'more', 'thought-provoking', 'addition', 'short-livedPlanet', 'Apes', 'Complete', 'TV', 'Seriesalso', 'had', 'humans', 'speak.In', 'conclusion', 'extraordinary', 'film', 'definitely', 'not', 'worthy', 'very', 'harsh', 'criticism', 'recently', 'received', 'everyone', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'just', 'think', 'need', 'give', 'film', 'second', 'real', 'chance', 'bias', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'original', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'adventure', 'sci-fi', 'tale', 'message', 'timely', 'social', 'commentaries']",N/A

541143,A2VUD4SPJO4V33,B00003CXXU,Theo,"[3, 3]","Tim Burton is undeniably one of the great stylists of popular cinema. I don't just mean that on a purely visual level, either. When he's at his absolute best, somehow the style actually becomes the substance. If that doesn't seem to make sense, considerEd Wood. It was Burton's decision to approach his chosen subject in the romanticized, even loving way that he did that made that film what it was. And it was glorious.But... There are times when something more fundamental is called for, and this was one of them. And to be brutally honest, that more fundamental something just wasn't there in this particular movie.If you're going to remake a film that's one of the standing icons of its genre, that's a pretty tough gig. Most especially so when the film you've chosen to remake is so well known for its moments: moments that come to define the film in our imaginations and to make it what it is. If you just copy those moments verbatim, then your film is in turn just a copy, and a pale one at that. Mere repetition is never going to have the same impact as the original. On the other hand, once you've taken those moments away, if you can't replace them with something equally staggering, or at least repackage and reinterpret the original material in a genuinely surprising way, then once again, there's really very little point in bothering with the remake at all.Unfortunately, there really was very little point in bothering with this particular remake at all. That's about as much as I can say without letting loose with the spoilers.There are positive things to say about this movie. Visually it was every bit the feast one would expect from a Tim Burton film - simultaneously cartoonish and intensely hyper-real. It also contains two truly exceptional performances.  Tim Roth takes a character of absolute, pitch-black villainy, and somehow infuses him with so much feeling that he comes across as more like a real-life psychopath than a two-dimensional bad guy. Burton's wife, Helena Bonham Carter, also most definitely delivers the goods. On a purely physical level, the way she moved brought a true chimpanzee-ness to her character that (in this one respect at least) put the original generation of films to shame. She's also somehow surprisingly attractive; and not just because she has the looks of Helena Bonham Carter somewhere beneath all that makeup. Her character comes across as an intelligent and genuinely interesting woman of the kind you really wish would take an interest in _you_. And this is coming from a man who's not normally attracted to chimpanzees, okay? Or at least, not very often.But... all that said, what's good about this movie isn't even close to being enough to carry the day. To be fair, taken simply as an action adventure flick, the film is quite watchable. Even enjoyable.

541144,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B00003CXXU,The Piper at the Gates,"[1, 1]","Most of the reviews I've read about this film are very similar to what I feel, but I thought I would at least put my two cents in as well. Much like other reviews, I'm a big fan of the original Planet of the Apes. Since this film's release, I've heard bad things about it, and I chose to stay away from it until recently. After finally watching it for the first time, I can't say it was as bad I thought it would be. However, its definitely not on the level of the original film at all. For me, the biggest problem is differences in the story that just doesn't make sense when compared to the original film(s). For example, how are the humans able to speak? Or can only some of them? Besides the Leo character, I believe there was only 4 humans speaking in the film. The rest kinda stood around blankly. Yet, they apparently could understand what was being said. For some or all humans to be able to understand and speak, it takes away the uniqueness of the Leo character (Wahlberg)that should have made him special. That was a very important plot device in the original film. Also there seems to be some weird attempt to have some sort of sexual tension between Leo and the ape Ari. It's just odd, and thankfully it didn't develop further in the film. As for the ""surprise"" ending that has gotten a lot of criticism, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense. There are theories out there by fans that do attempt to explain it. However, I read that Tim Burton himself said it wasn't supposed to make sense, so who knows. I realize the whole story arc of the Planet of the Apes films can be confusing, and any storytelling involving time travel is a recipe for confusion. But I think this was just the movie trying to be too clever and knowing that the original had a surprise ending (one of the best endings in any film I've seen, by the way), it was just a weak attempt to match it. The the effects and make-up were probably the best thing about the film. All the apes looked very good, except for the few female apes, which looked ridiculous to me! Not that the make-up was bad, but it was the way it was designed. Why did the female apes have modern human hairstyles? And I felt the make-up was too human looking to start with. You could see too much of the actress' features through the make-up. Were they trying to make the female apes more attractive? Was that the reason behind the vague love connection between Ari and Leo? I hate to say it, but honestly, Ari kinda reminded me of Michael Jackson! The acting was pretty good as well. The supporting cast includes Paul Giamatti, David Warner, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Kris Kristofferson. And even includes a cameo by Charlton Heston as an ape, which I thought was pretty cool. Mark Wahlberg was okay as the main protagonist, but of course it wasn't nothing compared to the performance of Charlton Heston in the original. Probably the best performance in the film goes to Tim Roth as the nasty General Thade. Though perhaps the character was a little too over the edge at times. In fact, I thought the depiction of the apes overall was a bit too harsh, primitive, and tyrannical. I felt that the apes had a bit more of civilized manner about them in the original. But most of them in this film seem to have an overly negative and aggressive attitude. Some people have complained about this film being too long or too boring. I didn't necessarily get bored or feel that the film was too lengthy (around 2 hours), and I thought the film was interesting and entertaining enough. However it isn't as dramatic, clever, or entertaining as the original whatsoever. I'm sure there's a lot more of other complaints I've overlooked that someone that's more familiar with the original series can, and probably have, pointed out. But for me, this film wasn't as bad as I expected, and its actually a decently made film. But when there's an attempt to remake or ""re-image"" a classic image, 99% of the time you're fighting a losing battle. That's probably why soon after the movie's release,  Tim Burton was quoted as saying ""he'd rather jump out a window"" than direct a follow-up. I'm kinda of thankful that they chose not to continue with this story, and went backward in the story arc with Rise of the Planet Apes, which is a much better film. But that's another review for another day.",3,"2.75 Stars: Better Than Expected, But Still a Weak ""Reimaging"" of a Classic Film.",1341100800,"07 1, 2012",2012,4329,"['Most', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'film', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'what', 'feel', 'thought', 'would', 'least', 'put', 'two', 'cents', 'as', 'well', 'Much', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'film', 'release', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'bad', 'things', 'chose', 'stay', 'away', 'recently', 'finally', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'However', 'definitely', 'not', 'level', 'original', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'differences', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'film', 's', 'example', 'how', 'are', 'humans', 'able', 'speak', 'can', 'only', 'Leo', 'character', 'believe', 'was', 'only', '4', 'humans', 'speaking', 'film', 'rest', 'kinda', 'stood', 'blankly', 'apparently', 'could', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'being', 'said', 'humans', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'speak', 'away', 'uniqueness', 'Leo', 'character', 'Wahlberg', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'special', 'was', 'very', 'important', 'plot', 'device', 'original', 'film', 'Also', 'there', 'be', 'weird', 'attempt', 'have', 'sort', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Leo', 'ape', 'Ari', 'just', 'odd', 'thankfully', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'further', 'film', 'surprise', 'ending', 'gotten', 'lot', 'criticism', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'sense', 'are', 'theories', 'there', 'fans', 'do', 'attempt', 'explain', 'However', 'read', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'said', 'was', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'make', 'sense', 'who', 'realize', 'whole', 'story', 'arc', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'storytelling', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'recipe', 'confusion', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'movie', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'clever', 'knowing', 'original', 'had', 'surprise', 'ending', 'one', 'best', 'endings', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'way', 'was', 'just', 'weak', 'attempt', 'match', 'effects', 'make-up', 'were', 'probably', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'apes', 'looked', 'very', 'good', 'few', 'female', 'apes', 'looked', 'ridiculous', 'Not', 'make-up', 'was', 'bad', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'designed', 'Why', 'did', 'female', 'apes', 'have', 'modern', 'human', 'hairstyles', 'felt', 'make-up', 'was', 'too', 'human', 'looking', 'start', 'could', 'see', 'too', 'much', 'actress', 'features', 'make-up', 'Were', 'trying', 'make', 'female', 'apes', 'more', 'attractive', 'Was', 'reason', 'vague', 'love', 'connection', 'Ari', 'Leo', 'hate', 'say', 'honestly', 'Ari', 'kinda', 'reminded', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'David', 'Warner', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'even', 'cameo', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'ape', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'was', 'okay', 'main', 'protagonist', 'course', 'was', ""n't"", 'nothing', 'compared', 'performance', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'original', 'Probably', 'best', 'performance', 'film', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'nasty', 'General', 'Thade', 'perhaps', 'character', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'edge', 'times', 'fact', 'thought', 'depiction', 'apes', 'overall', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'harsh', 'primitive', 'tyrannical', 'felt', 'apes', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'civilized', 'manner', 'original', 'most', 'film', 'seem', 'have', 'overly', 'negative', 'aggressive', 'attitude', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'being', 'too', 'long', 'too', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'get', 'bored', 'feel', 'film', 'was', 'too', 'lengthy', '2', 'hours', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'However', ""n't"", 'as', 'dramatic', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'original', 'whatsoever', ""'m"", 'sure', 'lot', 'more', 'other', 'complaints', ""'ve"", 'overlooked', 'someone', 'more', 'familiar', 'original', 'series', 'can', 'probably', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'expected', 'actually', 'decently', 'made', 'film', 'when', 'attempt', 'remake', 're-image', 'classic', 'image', '99', '%', 'time', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'losing', 'battle', 'probably', 'why', 'soon', 'movie', 'release', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'was', 'quoted', 'saying', ""'d"", 'rather', 'jump', 'out', 'window', 'direct', 'follow-up', ""'m"", 'kinda', 'thankful', 'chose', 'not', 'continue', 'story', 'went', 'backward', 'story', 'arc', 'Rise', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'review', 'day']",N/A
541145,A2EY2RBD9C3ZIR,B00003CXXU,The Seeker,"[0, 1]","""Planet of the Apes"" is a sci-fi film that was released to theaters in 2001. The film is directed by Tim Burton, and stars Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Estella Warren, and includes a cameo apperance by Charlton Heston, star of the original ""Planet of the Apes"" from 1968. The film also includes a wonderful soundtrack by the talented Danny Elfman. The film has Tim Burton's thumbprint all over it with all the themes Burton typicially uses in his films. Tim Burton insists that the film is not a remake, and has it's own original story. All the film does is use the same premise that the original ""Planet of the Apes"" did.THE STORY -It is the year 2029. A young man named Leo Davidson works on a United States Air Force space station called the Oberon. When a mission in space goes wrong, he crashes on a strange planet and finds himself in a world where intelligent and English-speaking humanoid Apes rule the world, and human beings are kept as slaves. The relationship between the two groups is very similar to the early relationship between European-Americans and Native-Americans and European-Americans and African-Americans.HOW THIS FILM COMPARES TO THE ORIGINAL ""PLANET OF THE APES"" FILMS -The original ""Planet of the Apes"" and the sequels that followed were full of political and social parables that both mirrored and responded to the many conflicts that were taking place in the United States of America during the years those films were released.What makes the 2001 ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot different then the original films are that the makers of the reboot took out the politics that was in the original series, and gave the audience a standard sci-fi action film of good vs. evil.The reboot does have an anti-racism theme, as well as a point that protests against general cruelty, but the reboot is fairly uncontroversial on the political level, not rocking the boat and not really challenging the mind that much.I also felt the original series had no villains or heroes - Just characters doing what they thought was right. Those films were not about telling you how to think. They were about telling you to think for yourself.The reboot however is very one-sided, and gives you the viewer a clear idea of who you're suppose to cheer for, and who you're suppose to be against.WHO I THINK WILL ENJOY THIS FILM -Kids. Boys for sure. The novelty of talking apes, the realistic make-up on the actors and actresses's playing the parts of the Apes, and the action/adventure theme of the film will appeal to them. There is mild cursing, some violence, and a few scary scenes, but nothing too bad I don't think. The one scene that really sticks out the most to me that may scare younger viewers is a scene where the lead character discovers two dead bodies of Apes, but that was the extent of horror I saw in the film. A parent may need to consider watching the film first to decide.People with a thing for Mark Wahlberg will enjoy the film I think as well. And people looking for solid and fun entertainment that doesn't make you think too much will also enjoy it.This was a summer blockbuster film, and a popcorn and soda movie, and the original ""Planet of the Apes"" is a classic, and very hard to beat. So it's best just to watch this film for what it is. - Just a good time-filler that I think is entertaining enough, and if you appreciate visual effects and make-up in movies, you're in for a ride.WHO I THINK WILL NOT ENJOY THIS FILM -Because the film is a straight-up good vs. evil film, some people may find the film to be too cliche for them. Most hardcore fans of the original, and just remake/reboot haters in general may not enjoy it because they won't be able to stop comparing it to the older films. And movie elitists won't be able to take a film about talking apes seriously, and will perceive it as a kid's film.MY THOUGHTS -I enjoyed this film, but it took a few times to get to that point. :) I really desired to enjoy the film because I loved the original series so much, but I had to stop comparing it to the older ""Apes"" films. What also helped me enjoy the reboot more is I read the book that the film was based on, and was able to appreciate the film more since the book went into greater detail and explained what the character's thoughts and feelings were.Visually, this film is beautiful. It plays a big part in why I liked it. I also loved the soundtrack by Danny Elfman. I felt his music summed up the emotions that many of the characters were feeling.All and all, the film is just a fun roller coaster kind of a film.",4,"""Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!""",1328054400,"02 1, 2012",2012,4612,"['Planet', 'Apes', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', '2001', 'film', 'directed', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'stars', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'cameo', 'apperance', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'star', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', '1968', 'film', 'also', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'talented', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'film', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'thumbprint', 'themes', 'Burton', 'typicially', 'films', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'not', 'remake', 'own', 'original', 'story', 'film', 'use', 'same', 'premise', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'did.THE', 'STORY', '-It', 'year', '2029', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Leo', 'Davidson', 'United', 'States', 'Air', 'Force', 'space', 'station', 'called', 'Oberon', 'When', 'mission', 'space', 'wrong', 'strange', 'planet', 'world', 'where', 'intelligent', 'English-speaking', 'humanoid', 'Apes', 'world', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'kept', 'slaves', 'relationship', 'two', 'groups', 'very', 'similar', 'early', 'relationship', 'European-Americans', 'Native-Americans', 'European-Americans', 'African-Americans.HOW', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'COMPARES', 'TO', 'THE', 'ORIGINAL', 'PLANET', 'THE', 'APES', 'FILMS', '-The', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'sequels', 'followed', 'were', 'full', 'political', 'social', 'parables', 'mirrored', 'responded', 'many', 'conflicts', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'United', 'States', 'America', 'years', 'films', 'were', 'released.What', '2001', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'reboot', 'different', 'then', 'original', 'films', 'are', 'makers', 'reboot', 'took', 'out', 'politics', 'was', 'original', 'series', 'gave', 'audience', 'standard', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'film', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil.The', 'reboot', 'have', 'anti-racism', 'theme', 'as', 'well', 'point', 'general', 'cruelty', 'reboot', 'fairly', 'uncontroversial', 'political', 'level', 'not', 'rocking', 'boat', 'not', 'really', 'challenging', 'mind', 'also', 'felt', 'original', 'series', 'had', 'villains', 'heroes', 'Just', 'characters', 'doing', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'films', 'were', 'not', 'telling', 'how', 'think', 'were', 'telling', 'think', 'yourself.The', 'reboot', 'however', 'very', 'one-sided', 'viewer', 'clear', 'idea', 'who', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'cheer', 'who', ""'re"", 'suppose', 'be', 'against.WHO', 'THINK', 'WILL', 'ENJOY', 'THIS', 'FILM', '-Kids', 'Boys', 'sure', 'novelty', 'talking', 'apes', 'realistic', 'make-up', 'actors', 'actresses', 'playing', 'parts', 'Apes', 'action/adventure', 'theme', 'film', 'will', 'appeal', 'mild', 'cursing', 'violence', 'few', 'scary', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'too', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'scene', 'really', 'out', 'most', 'may', 'scare', 'younger', 'viewers', 'scene', 'where', 'lead', 'character', 'discovers', 'two', 'dead', 'bodies', 'Apes', 'was', 'extent', 'horror', 'saw', 'film', 'parent', 'may', 'need', 'consider', 'watching', 'film', 'first', 'decide.People', 'thing', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'people', 'looking', 'solid', 'fun', 'entertainment', ""n't"", 'make', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'also', 'enjoy', 'it.This', 'was', 'summer', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'popcorn', 'soda', 'movie', 'original', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'classic', 'very', 'hard', 'beat', 'best', 'just', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'Just', 'good', 'time-filler', 'think', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'appreciate', 'visual', 'effects', 'make-up', 'movies', ""'re"", 'ride.WHO', 'THINK', 'WILL', 'NOT', 'ENJOY', 'THIS', 'FILM', 'film', 'straight-up', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'film', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'be', 'too', 'cliche', 'Most', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'original', 'just', 'remake/reboot', 'haters', 'general', 'may', 'not', 'enjoy', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'stop', 'comparing', 'older', 'films', 'movie', 'elitists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'take', 'film', 'talking', 'apes', 'seriously', 'will', 'perceive', 'kid', 'film.MY', 'THOUGHTS', '-I', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'took', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'point', 'really', 'desired', 'enjoy', 'film', 'loved', 'original', 'series', 'so', 'much', 'had', 'stop', 'comparing', 'older', 'Apes', 'films', 'What', 'also', 'helped', 'enjoy', 'reboot', 'more', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film', 'more', 'book', 'went', 'greater', 'detail', 'explained', 'what', 'character', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'were.Visually', 'film', 'beautiful', 'big', 'part', 'why', 'liked', 'also', 'loved', 'soundtrack', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'felt', 'music', 'summed', 'up', 'emotions', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'feeling.All', 'film', 'just', 'fun', 'roller', 'coaster', 'kind', 'film']",N/A

My eyes and ears were ready to bleed after watching them. The acting, special effects, music and plot were horrible. With Burton's remake, I am really glad that it was only loosely based on its predecessor. Apes 2001 offers great acting by Roth, Carter, Duncan, and Wahlberg. The music provided by Elfman is outstanding and the ever familiar gothic feel of Burton's film can be felt throughout. I really feel that this movie has an underlying message of racism. Apes rule the planet and feel that human's are dumb and are incapable of being civilized. Because of this, most are taken as pets or used as slaves.

541148,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B00003CXXU,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[8, 9]","Tim Burton has created a library of films that continue to delight and amaze his fans with quirky characters and off-beat stories. Burton helmed such diverse films as ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"", ""Batman"", ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"" stamping each with his unique sensibility. Each of these films has been a feast for the eyes, creating vivid landscapes and re-imagining time and place. What Tim Burton films lack is a screenplay that spends as much time on character development, dialogue and exposition as is spent on the visual look of the film. ""Planet of the Apes"", Burton's latest film, is his take on the 1968 sci-fi film.Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) is an air force pilot on a research space station, assisting a team experimenting with chimp-manned missions. When his favorite chimp gets lost, Davidson hops into another pod and tracks his lost friend. Davidson crash lands on a planet inhabited by apes and humans. However, on this planet, apes rule the humans. The apes are very advanced and have set-up a society which seems to be patterned after the Roman model. General Thade (Tim Roth) is the leader of the ape military and his right hand ape is Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). Most of the apes are so fearful of the humans that they relegate them to slave status and hunt down any that are not in their control. The Senator's (David Warner) daughter, Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) is disgusted by their treatment of humans and immediately thinks Davidson is interesting. Davidson soon leads a small group of humans to escape. Among them is Daena (Estella Warren) and her father, Karubi (Kris Kristofferson).The single best thing about this reimagined ""POTA"" is the make-up by Rick Baker. The new make-up allows the actors playing apes to actually build characters, to have facial expressions, to act like advanced apes. Roth is particularly memorable as the evil Thade. He moves like an ape and appears very menacing as he threatens and cajoles other characters. Bonham Carter is also very good as Ari. She manages to convey an intelligence and thoughtfullness for her character that I don't think would have been possible with less advanced make-up.The production design is interesting, but somehow it seems incomplete for a Tim Burton film. Basically, three main sets are used and they are fun to look at, but the production design does not extend beyond these areas. In ""Sleepy Hollow"", his production team built an entire village. When Ichabod Crane is venturing into the woods, they looked like they belonged to the time and place. In ""Apes"", it basically looks like they shot scenes in a desert.The actors playing humans fare less well than their ape-suited friends. Wahlberg looks stunned throughout the entire film. He is also unable to build the key relationships that he needs to build. He is unable to show any real anger towards Thade or build any romantic attachment between Ari or Daena. In fact, the `love triangle' between Davidson, Ari and Deana is just laughable. Any time Davidson has a `meaningful' scene with either Ari or Daena, Burton cuts away to the other female watching with a jealous look. Estella Warren is not a good actress. In both ""Driven"" and ""Apes"" she plasters one expression on her face and gosh-darned she is going to stick to that expression.The set-up involving the space research is interesting and holds the attention, but once the action centers on the planet, it becomes boring. I think this is in large part because Davidson never actually appears threatened by Thade or Attar. Yes, Thade and Attar are threatening Davidson, but Wahlberg never makes the character appear threatened. As soon as he is captured, he attempts to break out. Also, he doesn't appear to actually want to help the humans or the apes on the planet. As soon as he can, he jumps at the first chance to escape from the planet, leaving both Ari and Daena behind.The ending was the final straw. Without discussing or revealing too much, it doesn't make sense. The visuals and the story don't support the `kicker' ending that the filmmakers felt was necessary. If you are going to have a `kicker' ending, it needs to make sense. If it doesn't make sense, it spoils the film and leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Tim Burton is a gifted visual filmmaker. I would like to say that he is a gifted filmmaker, but I feel it necessary to add the `visual' qualifier. He spends so much effort and time on the visual he needs to devote an equal amount of time and attention to the story and characters.",2,One Mushy Banana,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",2005,4515,"['Tim', 'Burton', 'created', 'library', 'films', 'continue', 'delight', 'amaze', 'fans', 'quirky', 'characters', 'off-beat', 'stories', 'Burton', 'helmed', 'such', 'diverse', 'films', 'Pee-Wee', 'Big', 'Adventure', 'Batman', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'stamping', 'unique', 'sensibility', 'films', 'been', 'feast', 'eyes', 'creating', 'vivid', 'landscapes', 're-imagining', 'time', 'place', 'What', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'films', 'lack', 'screenplay', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'dialogue', 'exposition', 'spent', 'visual', 'look', 'film', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Burton', 'latest', 'film', 'take', '1968', 'sci-fi', 'film.Leo', 'Davidson', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'air', 'force', 'pilot', 'research', 'space', 'station', 'assisting', 'team', 'experimenting', 'chimp-manned', 'missions', 'When', 'favorite', 'chimp', 'lost', 'Davidson', 'pod', 'tracks', 'lost', 'friend', 'Davidson', 'crash', 'lands', 'planet', 'inhabited', 'apes', 'humans', 'However', 'planet', 'rule', 'humans', 'apes', 'are', 'very', 'advanced', 'have', 'set-up', 'society', 'be', 'patterned', 'Roman', 'model', 'General', 'Thade', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'leader', 'ape', 'military', 'right', 'hand', 'ape', 'Attar', 'Michael', 'Clarke', 'Duncan', 'Most', 'apes', 'are', 'so', 'fearful', 'humans', 'relegate', 'slave', 'status', 'hunt', 'down', 'are', 'not', 'control', 'Senator', 'David', 'Warner', 'daughter', 'Ari', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'disgusted', 'treatment', 'humans', 'immediately', 'thinks', 'Davidson', 'interesting', 'Davidson', 'soon', 'small', 'group', 'humans', 'escape', 'Daena', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'father', 'Karubi', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'single', 'best', 'thing', 'reimagined', 'POTA', 'make-up', 'Rick', 'Baker', 'new', 'make-up', 'actors', 'playing', 'apes', 'actually', 'build', 'characters', 'have', 'facial', 'expressions', 'act', 'advanced', 'apes', 'Roth', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'evil', 'Thade', 'ape', 'very', 'menacing', 'other', 'characters', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'Ari', 'convey', 'intelligence', 'thoughtfullness', 'character', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'possible', 'less', 'advanced', 'make-up.The', 'production', 'design', 'interesting', 'somehow', 'incomplete', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'film', 'Basically', 'three', 'main', 'sets', 'are', 'used', 'are', 'fun', 'look', 'production', 'design', 'not', 'extend', 'areas', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'production', 'team', 'built', 'entire', 'village', 'When', 'Ichabod', 'Crane', 'venturing', 'woods', 'looked', 'belonged', 'time', 'place', 'Apes', 'basically', 'shot', 'scenes', 'desert.The', 'actors', 'playing', 'humans', 'fare', 'less', 'well', 'ape-suited', 'friends', 'Wahlberg', 'stunned', 'entire', 'film', 'also', 'unable', 'build', 'key', 'relationships', 'build', 'unable', 'show', 'real', 'anger', 'towards', 'Thade', 'build', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'Ari', 'Daena', 'fact', 'love', 'triangle', 'Davidson', 'Ari', 'Deana', 'just', 'laughable', 'time', 'Davidson', 'meaningful', 'scene', 'Ari', 'Daena', 'Burton', 'away', 'other', 'female', 'watching', 'jealous', 'look', 'Estella', 'Warren', 'not', 'good', 'actress', 'Driven', 'Apes', 'one', 'expression', 'face', 'gosh-darned', 'going', 'stick', 'expression.The', 'set-up', 'involving', 'space', 'research', 'interesting', 'attention', 'once', 'action', 'centers', 'planet', 'boring', 'think', 'large', 'part', 'Davidson', 'never', 'actually', 'threatened', 'Thade', 'Attar', 'Yes', 'Thade', 'Attar', 'are', 'threatening', 'Davidson', 'Wahlberg', 'never', 'character', 'appear', 'threatened', 'As', 'soon', 'captured', 'break', 'out', 'Also', ""n't"", 'appear', 'actually', 'want', 'help', 'humans', 'apes', 'planet', 'As', 'soon', 'can', 'first', 'chance', 'escape', 'planet', 'leaving', 'Ari', 'Daena', 'behind.The', 'ending', 'was', 'final', 'straw', 'discussing', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'visuals', 'story', 'do', ""n't"", 'support', 'kicker', 'ending', 'filmmakers', 'felt', 'was', 'necessary', 'are', 'going', 'have', 'kicker', 'ending', 'make', 'sense', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth.Tim', 'Burton', 'gifted', 'visual', 'filmmaker', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'gifted', 'filmmaker', 'feel', 'necessary', 'add', 'visual', 'qualifier', 'so', 'much', 'effort', 'time', 'visual', 'devote', 'equal', 'amount', 'time', 'attention', 'story', 'characters']",N/A

I was on the edge of my seat all the way through.Fortunately for me my memory of the first one is very veige since I was so young when I saw it so I didn't have that to compare it to and I am glad. It was like seeing a whole new movie for me. Tom Roth was magnificent as General Thade, whom if he had his way he was just do away with all humans. He was frightening just to look at with his devilish eyes. Helena Bonham Carter was extraordinary in her role as Ari the human rights activist ape. She will definitely deserve an Oscar nod for this role. I have heard and read alot of criticism towards Mark Wahlberg's portrayal of Leo Davidson but he was apparently chosen for a reason. I had not seen many of his films but will be soon. I liked him in this film and he brought a new dimension to the film and was certainly different than the loin-cloth wearing Heston originally played as the lead. I was glad Tim Burton opted not to exploit Wahlberg's attributes and gave him an opportunity just to act. Even though I could imagine other actors carrying the lead I was quite impressed with Wahlberg myself. I thught he carried it off very well when it was clear the apes were really the ones who were carrying the picture. It was full of action and the makeup was so believable.

541158,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B00003CXXU,Traveler,"[5, 8]","I finally sat down and watched Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" for a second time to see if there any details I missed.  I happen to like most sci-fi films, even if there are minor errors in logic.  As long as the movie is entertaining and the characters are believable.  When I saw this movie the first time it fit all this criteria and it was definitely worth watching.First of all, the central story line, despite what the critics claim, makes sense for the most part.  The planet itself is inhabited by the survivors of the large spaceship that crashed.  The humans came from the crew, the apes from the animals that were on board.  The apes are more powerful because they had hidden their powers and intellect from the humans.  Given that it was a desolate planet the humans adapted poorly while the apes flourished.  The only possible gap here is that in the beginning we only see chimps.  But it's never made clear that only chimps are on board the spacecraft.That this story line diverts from the original shouldn't mean Burton's vision is wrong.  It's his movie and he can recreate the story.  However, there are two major gaps in his story.First of all, Charlton Heston's cameo as an ape who has an ancient gun made by humans doesn't make sense.  That specific planet and all its inhabitants derive from the spaceship which had 21st century technology.  The gun is from the 20th century.  So how did he get it?The second major flaw, as noted by countless others, is the ending.  I listened to Burton's comments in this section of the DVD and he was like a stammering teenager on dope trying to explain why he went with that specific ending.  He kept saying over and over that this is where the story was supposed to end. That might be the case, but he didn't leave anything in his story to bring the audience to that result.  How did Gen. Thade get to earth and go back in time?  Burton doesn't bother to explain in his commentary.  His answer is worthless at best.  He failed as the director to tell the story.  The only way Thade could have gone back in time on earth was if he had a workable spacecraft.  And he didn't.In both cases, Heston's gun and the ending, Burton was just lazy, pure and simple.  He wanted to add these neat little things to his movie and he didn't care how much it detracted from the final product.I happened to like ""Planet"" more the first time I saw it.

The idiotic plotting and narrative weakness hasn't been fixed. While Tim Burton is a fine and talented film director with a sharp eye, many of his films suffer from narrative holes big enough to drive a Mack truck through. Those previously films didn't have the disadvantage of such a poorly cast film. Tim Roth chews so much of the scenery I'm surprised any of the sets were left standing during shooting. To be fair, Roth appears to be making up for the lack of acting skills by two of the leads (and I'm not referring to Helen Bonham Carter). Mark Wahlberg's idea of emoting is to act like he's constantly out of breath. Perhaps the oxygen levels dropped on the planet and he's suffering from carbon dioxide poisoning. It would certain explain the performance and some of the idiotic decisions his character makes.There's entirely too much left to coincidence in the plot of this remake. I'm certainly not offended that they tried a different tact and, in fact, much of the basic plot elements could have been strung together to make an engaging, interesting film. That didn't happen here unfortunately. Still, Planet is interesting eye candy and for that I give it 3 stars. The extras on disc 2 I give 4 stars (although what's provided is out of proportion to the quality of the film itself--more is still less I suppose). The film itself and its goofy acting, deflated story and poor casting I'll give 1 star. It's not the worst film in the world but many of the elements here would have made Ed Wood proud.If you really love this film then stick with the previous DVD edition as there hasn't been much improvement and, in fact, it appears to be from the same original transfer. The occasional edge enhancements that cropped up in the original release are still here. The transfer itself is visually stunning at times. The extra audio tracks with commentary from Burton and composer Danny Elfman are interesting. The 5.1 mix still sounds really good despite some compression issues.On the whole, Planet mach 2 is a less than overwhelming experience.

For instance, in space, unless you have an illuminating body like a nearby star, you can't see anything unless the object is justifiably self-illuminated.  Like so many other Sci-Fi films, the space station was illuminated by a source I couldn't identify and in a way that didn't make sense.  But, then, what movie-value is there if a station-character sits in total darkness except for navigation/hazard lights and maybe a few illuminated windows, though in space I don't know what purpose windows would serve since you can't see anything anyway?  Okay.  Forget all that.  I suppose in movie-making technical accuracy must sometimes give way romantic correctness, sort of like hearing engine sounds or explosions in space, that you wouldn't really hear, unless you were within the atmosphere of the ship causing the noise. I thought there were too many repeat cliches in reverse from the original movie. But leaving all that aside, my two main gripes are that there was no explanation as to why the main character's shuttle-pod crashed whereas the chimp's shuttle-pod landed safely, even though both of them experienced the same phenomenon, and particularly after establishing the chimp's panic attack during a flight simulation.  The other gripe is that the movie provided no clues or justification for what the main character experiences upon his return to earth.  In the end, I think he was a poor choice (within the life of the movie)as an airman for such a futuristic Air Force.  Only the most professional and well-trained candidates would be picked for such a mission.  He was disobedient, never mind that there was nothing in the way of a flight officer or security guards in the launch bay. That something that sophisticated and advanced as a station with a perpetual power source not to have the ability to prevent an unauthorized launch is unbelievable. One of the cardinal rules I've read about writing, be it a novel or movie, is that you never never want your audience to say, ""but I would never do that!""",3,Ending is Mystifying,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2201,"['Costume', 'set', 'design', 'were', 'good', 'characterization', 'was', 'shallow', 'thought', 'film', 'lacking', 'technical', 'details', 'never', 'mind', 'fact', 'movie', 'fantasyland', 'instance', 'space', 'have', 'illuminating', 'body', 'nearby', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'object', 'justifiably', 'self-illuminated', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'Sci-Fi', 'films', 'space', 'station', 'was', 'illuminated', 'source', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'then', 'what', 'movie-value', 'there', 'station-character', 'sits', 'total', 'darkness', 'navigation/hazard', 'lights', 'maybe', 'few', 'illuminated', 'windows', 'space', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'purpose', 'windows', 'would', 'serve', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'anything', 'anyway', 'Okay', 'Forget', 'suppose', 'movie-making', 'technical', 'accuracy', 'must', 'sometimes', 'give', 'way', 'romantic', 'correctness', 'sort', 'hearing', 'engine', 'sounds', 'explosions', 'space', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'hear', 'were', 'atmosphere', 'ship', 'causing', 'noise', 'thought', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'repeat', 'cliches', 'reverse', 'original', 'movie', 'leaving', 'aside', 'two', 'main', 'gripes', 'are', 'was', 'explanation', 'why', 'main', 'character', 'shuttle-pod', 'crashed', 'chimp', 'shuttle-pod', 'landed', 'safely', 'even', 'experienced', 'same', 'phenomenon', 'particularly', 'establishing', 'chimp', 'panic', 'attack', 'flight', 'simulation', 'other', 'gripe', 'movie', 'provided', 'clues', 'justification', 'what', 'main', 'character', 'experiences', 'return', 'earth', 'end', 'think', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'life', 'movie', 'airman', 'futuristic', 'Air', 'Force', 'Only', 'most', 'professional', 'well-trained', 'candidates', 'would', 'be', 'picked', 'such', 'mission', 'was', 'disobedient', 'never', 'mind', 'was', 'nothing', 'way', 'flight', 'officer', 'security', 'guards', 'launch', 'bay', 'something', 'sophisticated', 'advanced', 'station', 'perpetual', 'power', 'source', 'not', 'have', 'ability', 'prevent', 'unauthorized', 'launch', 'unbelievable', 'One', 'cardinal', 'rules', ""'ve"", 'read', 'writing', 'be', 'novel', 'movie', 'never', 'never', 'want', 'audience', 'say', 'would', 'never', 'do']",N/A
541171,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,B00003CXXU,Wuchak,"[2, 2]","Year of Release: 2001Director: Tim BurtonCountry: USARuntime: 119 minutesTHE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of ""Planet of the Apes."" The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.WHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualties to the remake.For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's ""friend.""As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the ""Lincoln Memorial"" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or ""Beneath,"" but it's, at least, on a par with ""Escape."" And it's certainly better than ""Conquest"" and, especially, ""Battle.""The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious ""Apes"" fans it's even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original (or ""Beneath""), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.",3,"A Mixed Bag, but Ultimately a Decent Addition to the Apes Saga",1188950400,"09 5, 2007",2007,5363,"['Year', 'Release', '2001Director', 'Tim', 'BurtonCountry', 'USARuntime', '119',

Knowing the story, I didnt get lost throughout it, but I thought the story could have definately been a little more fleshed out. It seemed to just movie into subjects of the movie without much explanation. Some parts of the movie seemed like added comedy, which I dont think was neccessarily needed at all. There is quite a bit of action in this movie though which is a plus. Not really any boring parts. The acting is done quite well in my opinion. The scene at the end of the movie, the fighting scene is pretty good.Everything seems good, but then again the story should have been more fleshed out.

Houp ""RAREfiend""","[0, 2]","There are a lot of reviews that criticize this film on the sole point that it doesn't have the political satire that the original did.  I have several rebuttals to this philosophy.  First, This &quot;re-imagination&quot; obviously never intended for such a strong satirical edge, and so we should not reprimand it for what it was deliberately deprived of.  Second, I think that those who fail to find any political criticism do so because they are looking for the WRONG message from the WRONG era.  In my opinion, the only real sin that the filmmakers fell pray to in the &quot;re-imagining&quot; is by making the Human slaves talk.Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes is not intended to be thought provoking; it is intended to be fun.  Perhaps, we as a culture have degraded in intellect and no longer desire such intelligence, but it remains a truth that people sometimes go to the movies just to be thrilled and entertained.  If Planet of the Apes fails to make you think, it still doesn't deny one the thrills and entertainment expected of a summer sci-fi extravaganza.Yes, admittedly, this film has problems; but what big-budget nonsense summer film doesn't?  The acting is oftentimes atrocious; some of the dialogue is beyond laughable; the film does, perhaps, rush into the conflict a little too fast; and yes, the ending is somewhat silly, but I must proclaim that if the filmmakers hadn't at least TRIED to do something to one-up the original, I would have been more disappointed than I am with the stupidity we have instead.But still, beyond all of its faults, Planet of the Apes remains--not entirely senseless--fun.  There are a lot of good ideas in it, a lot of good visuals, CERTAINLY good make-up, and--to the films greatest benefit--not an overabundance of action to sap the audience their strength like every other high-adrenaline summer film.
