But viewings on TV One have made me aware of how hilarious this comedy really was.With the talents of Queen Latifah, who sings the title song, as magazine editor, Khadijah James, Kim Coles as her child-like cousin, Synclaire, who came from Minnesota to help her run ""Flavor"" Magazine, Erica Alexander's high-powered attorney Maxine Shaw,Kim Fields as gold digger Regine Hunter, T.C. Carson as stock broker Kyle Barker, and John Henton as the staid and slow-talking but surprisingly profound handyman Overton Wakefield Jones, audiences enjoyed five seasons of glimpses into the lives of a group of African American singles sharing an apartment complex in New York, with occasional guest appearances from everyone from the legendary Eartha Kitt(whom Kyle escorts to a mayor-sponsored fundraiser ""to get the graffiti off of the animals in the Bronx Zoo"" as a favor to get her to invest with his firm) to wrapper Heavy D in between.We see the complex relationships these apartment dwellers have with each other,and with others, and the banter between Max and Kyle is reminiscent of Beatrice and Benedict in Shakespeare's ""Much Ado About Nothing"", but much more wicked.The interactions between Synclaire and Overton are more amiable, and either way, it is easy to see who is destined for each other as the series progresses.At one point, Carson even wows us with his talent as a jazz vocalist. Two years after the series ended, he released an album entitled, ""Truth"".This lovely well-written comedy was a great showcase for many talented  Black actors.

952578,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000BYA4I8,Dorrie Wheeler,"[24, 24]","The first season of Living Single is now available on DVD for the very first time. Living Single premiered on the Fox Television Network in late 1993. The show aired immediately after Martin. The show became an instant hit sandwiched in between Martin and New York Undercover.The first season DVD set includes all 27 episodes from the shows first season. The packaging is very colorful and impressive. It's really a great set. Living Single airs in syndication all over the world. The first season quickly introduced the world to the ensemble cast. Queen Latifah starred as Kadijah, a magazine publisher. Kim Fields starred on the show as Regine. Regine was also a career woman, but her character was best known for her love life and her ever changing wigs. Ericka Alexander starred as Max, a successful lawyer, and Kim Coles starred as Kadijah's cousin Synclaire. The four working class women were kept company by their neighbors Kyle and Overton--who in later seasons would become love interests to women in the cast.Living Single was the first successful show about a group of working class, educated black women. In addition to the 27 season one episodes the DVD box set also includes a featurette titled ""How Ya Living"" Season One of Living Single. This featurette includes all of the shows cast members-with the exception of Queen Latifah. One can assume that she was too busy, but her absence in the featurette is not explained. It's a nice short featurette in which the shows creator Yvette Lee Bowser and the cast discuss the show.Living Single-The Complete First Season is a very satisfying release and fans of the show will be pleased with this release.",5,Fans of the show will be pleased with DVD set quality,1140652800,"02 23, 2006",2006,1664,"['first', 'season', 'Living', 'Single', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'Living', 'Single', 'premiered', 'Fox', 'Television', 'Network', 'late', '1993', 'show', 'aired', 'immediately', 'Martin', 'show', 'became', 'instant', 'hit', 'sandwiched', 'Martin', 'New', 'York', 'Undercover.The', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', '27', 'episodes', 'shows', 'first', 'season', 'packaging', 'very', 'colorful', 'impressive', 'really', 'great', 'set', 'Living', 'Single', 'airs', 'syndication', 'world', 'first', 'season', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'world', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'starred', 'Kadijah', 'magazine', 'publisher', 'Kim', 'Fields', 'starred', 'show', 'Regine', 'Regine', 'was', 'also', 'career', 'woman', 'character', 'was', 'best', 'known', 'love', 'life', 'ever', 'changing', 'wigs', 'Ericka', 'Alexander', 'starred', 'Max', 'successful', 'lawyer', 'Kim', 'Coles', 'starred', 'Kadijah', 'cousin', 'Synclaire', 'four', 'working', 'class', 'women', 'were', 'kept', 'company', 'neighbors', 'Kyle', 'Overton', 'who', 'later', 'seasons', 'would', 'become', 'love', 'interests', 'women', 'cast.Living', 'Single', 'was', 'first', 'successful', 'show', 'group', 'working', 'class', 'educated', 'black', 'women', 'addition', '27', 'season', 'one', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'also', 'featurette', 'titled', 'How', 'Ya', 'Living', 'Season', 'One', 'Living', 'Single', 'featurette', 'shows', 'cast', 'members-with', 'exception', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'One', 'can', 'assume', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'absence', 'featurette', 'not', 'explained', 'nice', 'short', 'featurette', 'shows', 'creator', 'Yvette', 'Lee', 'Bowser', 'cast', 'show.Living', 'Single-The', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'very', 'satisfying', 'release', 'fans', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'pleased', 'release']",LIVING SINGLE: S1 (DVD)

Overton (the girls' handyman neighbour) steals the show every time (as does Max) and I love the banter between all the girls and the love/hate relationship between Max and Kyle.  They fight all the time and their quips are so funny.  It's full of fun and quirky characters and cute 'storylines' that will have you in stitches over and over.  There are times when it looks a little dated (like the episode where they went out to a club to go dancing and the now funny scene where Kyle has a brand new cell phone - a first back then), but it's got that cool 90's feel.

952593,AJK5WHV1GW941,B000BYA4I8,Mikeisha Best,"[1, 1]","""Living Single"" is a sitcom about three women who reside together: Regine, Khadijah and Synclaire.  Add their friend Max, who is ever present in their home, and their neighbors Kyle and Overton, and you have a great formula for what was a very successful TV show!  Khadijah and Max are the most level headed of the bunch, often holding everything together.  Synclaire is the nave, sweet woman in the clan.  Regine is the superficial, man hungry one of the bunch.  Together they bring a heap amount of laughter!  Although the show is titled, ""Living Single"", between the four of them, a man was often present.Season One includes a lot of great episodes.  We see all throughout the season certain things: Regine will sometimes stop at nothing to gain the interest of a man, Overton has an undying crush on Synclaire, Max things she's the greatest lawyer alive, and Kyle's ego is as big as the day is long.  Although Khadijah has a very hard edge about herself, she manages to attract some men in season one.  In one episode, her friends feel neglected because she is spending much time with a man.  Khadijah is illustrated as very headstrong, intelligent and usually tries to avoid conflict.  Sometimes her friends would come to her trying to get her to gossip, and she would usually refuse.  Synclaire is illustrated as a real sweetheart throughout this season.  Sometimes, however, they made her say and do some things that made her look like a moron.  For example, some of the things she did at her job were just unorthodox like firing one of her coworkers when Khadijah put her in charge because she was sick.  But the love Overton has for Snyclair is undeniable.  He always looks out for her and makes sure everyone is treating her nicely.  Because he had his eye on her, he didn't want anyone else dating her, and sometimes he would go to extremes to prevent that.  In one episode, Synclaire goes out on a date with a doctor.  When Overton finds out about it, he goes to the restaurant where Snyclaire and her date are dining, and finds a way to get her date to leave, and Overton finishes the night with Synclaire, pure comedy!  Several times, we see Regine dating different men with prestige and good looks.  In episode one, she even dates a married man!  She stoops to some pretty low levels to appease the men in her life.I recommend this set of DVDs to anyone who is looking for some laughter.

952598,A2LNEZD3YBO12O,B000BYA4I8,Preston,"[4, 4]","I liked ""Living Single"" when it appeared on Fox in the '90s. Perhaps the biggest gamble and risk was of Fox putting it against NBC's ultra-popular sitcom ""Friends."" But Living managed to get strong audiences while Friends was always No. 1 or top 10. For that alone, Fox kept the show's integrity going without saying anything about the other network's competition. I'm really getting this DVD and future seasons' DVDs to really follow on Maxine's on-off relationship with her boyfriend played by TC. I didn't pay close attention to it during the show's run.Their relationship got stronger in the fourth and fifth seasons.  Queen Latifah, Kim Fields and the very funny Kim Coles were all good on the show and Erika Alexander was the best out of the four actors on that show with her Maxine character. Her Maxine character was the most believable.  Kim Fields' Regine was always changing her hairstyle on nearly every show.  Latifah really managed to translate well to TV after several rap albums. She has always been good at anything she does--TV, movies, music, daytime talk show that lasted 2 years and so forth. Some of this season's first shows from '93 are a little weak--some of the writing is a little silly, but the show's '94 episodes were better as well as the next four seasons. It's kind of similar to some of the characters on ""Friends"",the quirkiness and adult humor of some of them. Plus, they live in an apartment. I liked that they finally put it on DVD even though it's been on syndication on local stations and cable networks for a few years now.

Now when an 83-year-old man can sit down and giggle about four single women and their two male friends living life, handling relationships, and pursuing their careers all with a quirky sense of humor, that's great.  I loved ""Martin,"" but I'd rush through that show so I could get to ""Living Single.""  This writer picked the right show, the right cast, the right dialogue, and it was such a relief to see a black television show that went away from all of the negative stereotypes that other t.v. shows and music videos LOVE to show.  I watched them all in anticipation and even though I'd heard the jokes a thousand times by watching it in syndication, I still laughed out loud at the crew playing the dozens.  I watched ""Behind the Scenes,"" and it is very easy to believe that these folks had a great time onset and it wasn't just an act.  I like how hip-hop was always incorporated and this crew would burst into melodies out of nowhere.  I think my favorite moments were when they'd sing Christmas songs, bust out with Sugarhill Gang lyrics, ""Brickhouse,"" ""I Will Survive,"" etc.  I could EASILY see me sitting down and chilling with people like their characters, and when I was in high school, my friends and I would compare how much each of us acted like a character on this show.Cons: I love seeing Synclaire and Overton get together, but the only reason this didn't get five stars is because none of those episodes had Kyle and Maxine getting together.

952601,A15MLF38WROSWU,B000BYA4I8,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[32, 33]","Living Single was one of my favorite shows when it used to come on FOX and I'm so excited it came out Season 1 has been released on DVD.  Living Single was such a positive depiction of African Americans.  You had goal oriented people who were trying to live life in the city.  Dealing with career challenges, and relationships.  It was a show anyone could relate to regardless of race.  This show had such a wonderful cast that had awesome chemistry.  Erika Alexander as Attorney Maxine Shaw, Kim Fields as the Diva Regine, Kim Coles as the dense, but very funny Synclaire James cousin of Kadijah played by Queen Latifah.  T.C. Carson as the suave ladies man Kyle, and John Henton as the handyman Overton who is in love with Synclaire.  What I liked about the show is the women with the exception of Maxine were not skinny women.  Kadijah always wore nice outfits to the office and looked nice when she dressed casual and even though she was an average sized woman, had no problem dating.  I really liked that.Kadijah was owner of Flava Magazine, and Synclaire worked with her as the office assistant.  One of my favorite episodes is when Synclaire runs the office while Kadijah is out sick.  Despite everything that happened she managed to get that Shoe La La account.  Kyle works in the finance industry, and even though it's not mentioned a lot, there was one episode that showed his desire to move up in the company, and his willingness to play poker with his coworkers.  Regine worked, but she was really known for her outfits, her wigs, and her love life.  First episode found her dealing with the fact she was dating a married man, then another episode had her dating a man that had a young daughter.I loved the interaction between Kyle and Maxine.  They were always going at it, but you could not help but laugh.  Maxine liked to date, but still getting over the pain of her ex-boyfriend ""Packing his little raggedy duffel bag and left.""Even thought it was Regine, Kadijah and Synclaire who were the roommates, you would find Maxine at their house all the time eating their food.  Maxine lived in the building across the street.  Kyle and Overton were roommates who lived upstairs in the same building.There is some poked at Kim Fields, but you miss it if you never watched The Facts of Life.  In the ""A Kiss before lying"" episode there is a line where Maxine's new fianc&eacute; says ""I went to a small private school called Eastland"" and Regine says ""Never heard of it"" and then grins into the camera.  I found that to be rather amusing.I like all the episodes, but the following are my stand out episodes that I will watch a lot:1.  Whose Date is it anyway? Synclaire dates a very handsome veterinarian played by Tommy Ford (of the television show Martin)2.  Full Court Press - Khadijah goes to court after an automobile accident and Maxine helps represent her.  When Khadijah throws the cake in Maxines face at the end of the episode I just laugh. Kyle and Overton Join a gym and over do their workout.3.  Great Expectations - the gang go out clubbing, Regine pours drinks on women wearing her one of a kind dress, and Maxine attracts a guy who has a gold tooth in his mouth.4.  A Kiss before lying - Maxine faces her ex (Raggedy duffle bag) and his new fianc&eacute;.5.  Just Friends - Khadijah's friendship with her old pal Scooter crosses into more then friends.6.  The Naked Truth - Overton moves in with the girls after a fight with Kyle and walks in on a naked Khadijah.7.  Crappy Birthday - the girls go to Atlanta City to celebrate Khadijah's birthday.8.  Love takes a Holiday - Kyle gets his heartbroken.9.  Fatal Distraction - Khadijah hires a writer without checking his references and has to fire him when his writing is terrible.10.  The hand that Robs the Cradle - one of my all time favorite episodes.  Maxine dates a college freshman played by Terrence Howard.11.  Love they Neighbor - Synclaire finally tells Overton how she feels and gives him a whopper of a kiss.12.  Mystery Date - the girls find themselves fighting over a new guy who moves into the building played by Morris Chestnust.13.  Hot fun in the Wintertime - Synclaire has to decided who she is taking on a trip she won on a radio show, and Regine's winter party is turned into a summer party because the heat is too high in the apartment.14.  Whose the Boss - Khadijah is sick with the flu, and Synclaire sits in for her as boss.15.  Five card stud - the girls crash Kyles poker party and when one of his coworkers utters the B word, things get ugly.16.  Love is a many splintered thing - When Khadijah starts hanging out with her new boyfriend, the girls feel slighted.17.  She ain't heavy she's my mother - Khadijahs and Regines mother comes in for Mothers day.  The mothers were played by real moms Chip Fields and Rita Owens.18.  What's Next - Maxine wakes up realizing she slept with Kyle.  Khadijahs two men in her life run into each other and she has to make a choice.  I love this episode!!!There were some notable guest appearances in Season 1 as well.Nia long, Tommy Ford, Miguel Nuznez - Goldie, Teri J. Vaughn (Steve Harvey Show), Isabelle Sanford as the assistant that replaces Synclaire.  Flip Wilson and Ed Mcman, Terrance Howard, Cree Summer, Morris Chestnut, Melissa DeSousa (plays Carmen), Mark Curry, Jerome Betis (Football Player), Anna Marie Johnson.In addition to all 27 episodes you have the How Ya Living extra with the cast minus Queen Latifah.  Yvette Lee Bowser the shows creator and the cast discuss the show.  I liked hearing the cast discuss how much fun they had.  It's not explained why Queen Latifah was not present, but when you finish watching the extra feature, you don't really miss hearing what she has to say about being a part of the show.If you were a fan of Living Single then you need to own this Season 1 set.  I just hope we are not kept waiting for the other season sets.  I can't wait to own them all.  I know the show is in syndication, but I like being able to pick which episodes I watch over and over again, and not having to deal with the commercials.",5,Awwww sookie sookie now!!!!!,1143590400,"03

While most of the smarter companies have gone to the slimline dvd case( which makes it almost impossible for the dvds to come loose),good ole backwoods Warner Bros. still uses the jewel case style cardboard packaging.You know, the ones  where you get the discs to your door and most of them are dislodged from their holder? As a bonus feature they are overlapped on eachother which means when you put one disc back you have to remove the other first, simply lovely, right? Well i guess Warner thinks we should be happy because at least they are not flippers, which Warner Bros still makes!!!!!*****************UPDATE**************************************************The show gets a 5 hands down, the people in charge of taking their sweet time rolling out this dvd and then taking now, almost two years and no follow-up season release, well those people get a negative 5 stars.Funny how really stupid asinine shows roll off the line and onto shelves hand over fist, but good quality, positive shows like this get played around with, but I'll tell you what there are plenty of places out there where people have recorded the shows over the years and sell them on dvd , sure they aren't great quality like this, but they are better than nothing!I for one am sick of the industry and from today on will do my best NOT to support it, you don't wanna support us fans?
