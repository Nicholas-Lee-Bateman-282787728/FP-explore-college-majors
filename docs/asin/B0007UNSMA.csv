The basic deal is that someone has to be arrested and convicted of a murder they didn't commit, sentenced to the electric chair and then rescued at the last minute when the real killer is found out.It works every single time. Yet, other than Eastwood's True Crime we almost never see it anymore.This film is one of more than a dozen movies made on teh same theme in the 1930s and does the job very well, with good noir cinematography and a last minute surprise ending.The remastering is very high end.",5,Classic Studio Production,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,600,"[""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'studios', 'stopped', 'making', 'genre', 'movie', 'formula', 'almost', 'always', 'well', 'basic', 'deal', 'someone', 'be', 'arrested', 'convicted', 'murder', 'did', ""n't"", 'commit', 'sentenced', 'electric', 'chair', 'then', 'rescued', 'last', 'minute', 'when', 'real', 'killer', 'found', 'out.It', 'single', 'time', 'other', 'Eastwood', 'True', 'Crime', 'almost', 'never', 'see', 'anymore.This', 'film', 'one', 'more', 'dozen', 'movies', 'made', 'teh', 'same', 'theme', '1930s', 'job', 'very', 'well', 'good', 'noir', 'cinematography', 'last', 'minute', 'surprise', 'ending.The', 'remastering', 'very', 'high', 'end']",N/A

890818,A42QN9MM6LKKM,B0007UNSMA,Lee in S.F.,"[1, 3]","Because this movie was made in 1944, maybe it should be judged by 1944 standards.  For me, by today's standards, it clearly aims to entertain and often does--yet is awkward in technique and perspective.  I gave it a three-star rating in deference to the year of its issuance.  On the one hand, it wasn't an awful, horrible movie, because I stuck with it until the end, and am glad I did.  Parts of it are charming.  For me, it was acceptable Sunday afternoon fare.  Even so, I also couldn't watch it without being continually reminded of its clumsy depictions.I agree, as others have said, that the lead female and male characters were appealing.  Nevertheless, they were surrounded by many stick figures--two-dimensional actors plugged into slots to advance the story line.  The suspense was at times effective, yet marred by its underwhelming appraisal of audience intelligence (as further noted below).As for its direction, I was often reminded of high school theatrical productions, where characters stand stiffly until it's time for line delivery.  Little to no effort was made to flesh out character depth or relationship development.  In lieu of seamless transitions, scenes were often pieced together in a way that that reminded me that movies are basically whole bunch of scenes pasted together.This is billed as a suspense piece, but effective suspense is built upon believable premises, rather than set-up's that insult intelligence.  In this movie, I wondered, for example, how a doctor could get to a place of proposing marriage, but without his intended fiance knowing what he does for a living.  Later, I was dumb stuck that there was such insufficiency of witness questioning that distinctions weren't drawn between what witnesses saw, and what witnesses inferred about what they saw.  I also groaned over how the viewer was clubbed with the trumpeted authority of a new science, psychology, to compel us to assume that the male lead was proficient in this field, when not much was shown to substantiate the same.As revealed in this movie, 1944 attitudes towards women were ugly.  Three female parts with speaking roles (older sister, younger sister, and a short scene with a housekeeper) painted painfully polarized views of women.  Women were apparently either ""too good to be true"" Madonna's (like the good, noble, beautiful Mary), or were easily dismissed as non-entities (like the attractive but air-headed sister, and the drab housekeeper).  The non-speaking role of a female witness likewise showed women as inconsequential.  For example, both she and the male witness saw the same thing, but only he testified.  The inference is that the female witness sheepishly went along with the male witness's arrogant conclusions, and so he spoke for both.  Hence, she was made invisible.The dismal status of the female sex is also shown in the scene where Mary's dress catches fire.  To my astonishment, the director had Mary put her hand over her eyes and RUN, in lieu of taking self-protective action.  I saw the helplessness with which she was painted as sordid--especially since she was otherwise shown as responsible and together.  More discrimination was shown in that when the director needed to incorporate new key players, he gladly did so at the expense of the lead heroine.  In contrast, however, the director never once made the lead hero look incompetent and idiotic (not even to advance a scene).Similarly, Mary's sister, a party girl, was portrayed as being so air-headed she would conclude that her good and caring sister MUST be guilty, simply because she'd once overheard Mary threaten the victim.  This two-dimensional portrayal was so complete that, despite enjoying years of Mary's loving care, this younger sibling amazingly didn't once question her conclusion that her sister was a murderer.Males in the movie openly take digs at women, also.  For example, a ""full of himself"" male sitting at the bar snorts a put-down about Mary's sister as a plot device to make the male lead look good.  In another scene, a male shows amazement for Mary's high-minded reflections, contemptuously declaring that women aren't known to use logic.  The closing scene reinforces a cultural theme introduced at the outset, which is that even refined and beautiful women must be forced to passively suffer at the hands of piggish male drunks. (If that one-down scenario, pity the dismal plights of women who earned their living as housekeepers, who thus had no money or time to indulge in glamor.)At the time of this writing, there were two other reviews, and those reviewers focused on appreciation for the suspenseful story line and actors.  While I don't disagree with their praise, I also find that  the ""what"" of a situation (suspenseful story) isn't totally appealing if the ""how"" is as flawed as it was in this movie.  I thus saw the movie's questionable methods of establishing suspense at times, along with a dismal 1944 view of women, as irritants that robbed me of full immersion in a necessary ""suspension of belief.""  I was pained that such perspectives diminish the male grasp of their humanity, while simultaneously robbing women of right regard.  Thank goodness we're slowly evolving past such viewpoints now.I was an impressionable child when movies like this were being shown, and I went to the movies often back then.  In my innocence, I most definitely took in some of the destructive messages embedded in these movies, and didn't know to question them.  At this point, I like to watch old movies like this for their entertainment value, but also to track down unconsciously absorbed, antiquated attitudes.  I appreciate that the movie can bring old impressions into consciousness, where they can be examined and confronted.Clearly, outstanding films with credible story lines can be made to displace scripts which rely upon diminishing whole groups of people.  (Ditto for the plethora of current movies fueled by excessive violence and meaningless sex.)  Eventually, as humanity evolves, perhaps the populace will require the entertainment industry to present realistic portrayals of humanity which still command compelling profits.  That's my hope and belief, anyway.  In the same vein, fantastic entertainment could even be created which brings out the best that lies within us.  (Imagine that!) Such films would benefit everyone, because movies are a powerful influence, and an important part of our culture.  It would be lovely to see any early sign of an awakening which indicates that healthy profits for entertainment can be successfully combined with constructive influences.",3,1944 awkwardness shows how
