In my case, I bought the 1 season from a dealer, watched about half of it, then never finished until a year later. Found out that disk 3 side B - the 2 final episodes - did not exist there. Or may be they exist but the DVD player says ""No disk"" to side B. I have no idea whether the disk was like this at manufacturing, or the seller simply did not mention that there was a serious problem with the disks.

Corden ""Book lover extraordinaire""","[9, 45]","I purchased season 1 and thought it was so-so but then as I started watching repeats of seasons 1 and 2, it dawned on me that this was one terrible show. I think the acting is poor (but that could be the fault of the scripts and/or the directors). Speaking of scripts, could the dialogue and scenes be any weaker? Invariably, on each show one of the agents will come into the scene and say ""I have a lead on the car (or phone number). I'm going to check it out."" Exit scene.I just can't believe that real FBI agents act like this quintet. LaPaglia's hair is long, then regulation, then long, then . . .well you get the idea. If there is an actress more sorry than Marianne Jean-Baptiste in a lead role, I have yet to meet her. Also, why are these two so argumentative with the relatives or friends of the missing person. I'm thinking especially of the father of the autistic boy who went missing in a museum. And if it is a husband or wife who went missing, then invariably the question is ""Was he (she) having an affair?"" and ""Are you having an affair?""Poppy Montgomery, an FBI agent? Come on. First, she has an affair with her supervisor (LaPaglia). Then she jumps into bed with one of her co-workers (Eric Close). Not in any FBI that I know.At least Close and Enrique Murciano look and act like agents (and so does Montgomery, when she is out of bed) but they are handicapped by weak scripts and direction.There are better series out there.

831559,A26FY1ID4Z56FV,B0002DRE72,Darren Thornton,"[6, 6]","As a longtime ER fan, I wanted to see the show that's been beating it in the ratings lately.  It took me 2 weeks to finish the set.  (Who else is grateful for libraries?)  Wow!  I'm not through with ER.  But this show deserves a look too.  TNT's carrying reruns.  Also, CBS is moving it to Sundays this coming season.  This isn't just another crime show.  You get involved with these characters.  I have to commend the cast.  Ironically, 3 of the five principals aren't from the USA.  Anthony and Poppy are from Australia.  It was strange to hear Marianne using her native English accent on a bonus feature.  Lynn Whitfield, from my home state of Louisiana, has a recurring role as Jack's boss.  Not all of these missing persons cases have happy endings.  Some turn up alive.  Others are dead.  Or you just don't know what happened.  I only occasionally guessed the ending.  That's something you can't say very often about many TV shows.  How about the guest stars? Charles S. Dutton (Roc) won an Emmy for playing a father obessed with finding his missing son.  It's been years. We see the future Joan of Arcadia.  24 fans can see Gregory Itzin before he became the evil President Logan.  ER fans will note Frank the retired cop/desk clerk.  That episode also featured William Sanderson (Newhart, Lonesome Dove), who did an ER episode.  I like that we only got glimpses of their personal lives.  This apparently changed in later seasons.  The bonus features are quite good.  There's a commentary for the pilot.  Hank Steinberg, the creator of the series, has a fantastic commentary for the season finale.  This two-part episode has been reedited, with additional footage.  One of my few beefs is including two other bonus features on Disc 4.  Together, they're about 25 minutes.  Both are good.  But why not just add them to a previous disc?  That's all you get on Disc 4.  Still, I give this set 5 stars.  Get ready to join the team!

831560,A6P73HMHDW5W3,B0002DRE72,David Solomon,"[4, 6]","This is the best show I almost missed. When I watched the pilot for ""Without a Trace,"" I hated it. The lighting was too dark, the actors mumbled their lines, and the background music was too loud to hear what they were mumbling.I tried it again a few weeks later. It was like watching a different show! The lighting was brighter, and you could understand what the actors were saying.After a few episodes, ""Without a Trace"" became one of my favorites.The writing is excellent and has to be. The narrow format (a person disappears, the FBI team investigates, and what happened is revealed) requires that the characters that vanish must be interesting--and they are! They also do a good job of varying the ending. Some weeks, the missing person is found and reunited with his or her family, and other weeks, the ending isn't so happy.However, the best episodes on these disks are the ones that break the format. The 2-part episode that concludes Season 1, involving a hostage situation involving one of the agents, is one of the most suspenseful TV episodes I've ever seen. The episode in which Anthony LaPaglia's character is under investigation by the Internal Affairs-like division is not that far behind.The actors are outstanding, especially Anthony LaPaglia as Jack Malone. I invite people to watch him on this show, then watch him play Jane Leeves' drunken brother, Simon, when the later episodes of ""Frasier"" come out. You will not believe the same actor is playing both characters.Poppy Montgomery is also excellent. How can any character named Samantha Spade not be interesting?

This group of five headed by Jack Malone (Anthony Lapaglia) must find out who the missing person was to find out where they might be.  They work backwards in time and forward in a race to find the missing person before 48 hours are up.  Because after 48 hours chances of finding them alive are very slim.This show is without a doubt one of the best on TV.  I happened to stumble upon the reruns and was watching because I thought Anthony Lapaglia looked familiar.  Of course I was thinking of Simon Moon from Frasier.  By the time I could get my husband to confirm my suspicions I was hooked on this show.  It is so well written and filmed that you can't watch and not become addicted.The cast of this show is great.  These five actors will make you forget your watching TV and make you believe your part of the team trying to solve the case.  The writing is wonderful.  In addition the way the show is filmed will leave you wanting more.  I just can't say enough about this show. It has been awhile since I've been so excited about a TV show.This DVD package is so great.  The quality is excellent.  And the extras are very entertaining.  You go behind the scenes to learn how the show was developed and how the cast was picked.  Then you can learn how the sets were made and discover that they actually have an ex-FBI man as an advisor to make the show look and feel real.  This is just great.  This shows the interest and pride the producers take in the show to go to the length of having an advisor help in making it real.  I think this has a great deal to do with why the show is such a success and seems real.This DVD is a must have for any fan of Without a Trace.

Executive producer Jerry Bruckheimer who helms the also excellent CSI trio brings us a cast made in heaven, superb storylines, and some gutwrenching episodes.  Anthony LaPaglia is superb as head agent Jack Malone of the FBI's Missing Persons unit.  Considered rather a maverick man, who sometimes bends the rules in the name of justice, LaPaglia brings a strength and sensitivity to his role that makes Jack Malone one of the best leading roles on t.v.  He is given fine support by Poppy Montgomery as Samantha Slade, a lovely young agent whose cynicism belies her innate compassion; Marianne Jean-Baptiste is Vivian Johnson, the stoic team member who acts as the voice of logic and reason and whose delivery is so natural, she doesn't seem like she's acting; Enrique Murciano as the Latino, whose has a sharp sense of humor and a quick temper at times; and Eric Close is Martin Fitzgerald, the Deputy Director's son who wants to prove to his team he is a good agent and not just his father's puppet.  Along with superior camerawork, editing and music, the series has given us some marvelous guest performances from actors like Charles S.

Long ""JaminRebel""","[1, 1]","Actors: Anthony LaPaglia, Poppy Montgomery, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Enrique Murciano, Eric Close.I don't have cable anymore so I started watching reruns of this show. I bought the first season at a pawn shop, new, for about $12. I find this show to be very hit or miss. Some episodes are fairly hard to follow. So it's a good thing I have the show on dvd so I can rewind the episode. As for the actors, I am not overly impressed with Anthony LaPaglia, but then too he is often forced to act out some ridiculous scripts. In one episode, to save a young man's life, LaPaglia pretends to ""identify"" with a child molester/serial child killer. He talks to the killer in the car and tells him how great it would be to have some alone time with the young man in question. It was all  pretty ridiculous to watch as it played out. It was entirely unbelievable. I think it's great that they saved the young man, but to see this acted out was to watch an absurdity. LaPaglia suffers from weak to bad scripts, as do most of the actors. Still, I think LaPaglia is a stretch to be the lead guy on this FBI team. As for Poppy Montgomery, where have they been hiding this beautiful young woman. I can barely take my eyes off of her. She is a natural beauty. Her acting is decent, and most of the time I think she is believeable. Marianne Jean-Baptiste is good as the anchor of the team, but her role is too stereotypical. She plays a seasoned FBI agent who is not frazzled by anything. Nothing is new to her. She has seen it all and she is a cool pro. The problem with her character is that I can see all of this very easily. It's all just a little too transparent. I'm not sure who is who with the other two FBI characters. The son of the congressman character is a pretty strong character, especially given that he is suppossed to be the new guy on the team. The other guy on the team is ok I guess. I really can't remember much about the guy as I am writing this.The writing simply needs to be better on this show. This show starts with the disappearance of a character. Sometimes the show gives us more, and sometimes almost nothing to go on. It's easy to get confused or bored. Some of these missing people are hard to care about. One has to care a little about the missing person to be able to follow the story line. Anyway, I can't give this show much more than an ok. I didn't know it at the time, but apparently this show is a sort of spin off from CSI. To prove this all you have to do is buy season 8 of CSI for they give you a CSI/Without a Trace team up. I think one episode was a CSI episode. And then in Season 8 of CSI we are given a bonus episode of Without a Trace. I guess I should have been thankful because that year there was a writer's strike and so we got about half of the usual CSI episodes. Anyway, I couldn't follow the story at all, not the CSI episode, nor the roll over into the bonus Without a trace episode. And was that bonus episode also the pilot of Without a Trace? Really, I think the pilot was a different story. I'll check and update this.I guess it's just as one other reviewer wrote, ""You probably either love this show or you hate it."" Me, I want to like it but it's definitely a poor man's CSI. This show has it's appeal though. It's just an ok show in my opinion. I watch it but sometimes it puts me to sleep, and other times I get lost in an episode. They develop these characters one bit of evidence at a time.

ALP truly is the show's rock - he MAKES it so compelling and repeated watching of his fine performances only make you appreciate  what an extraordinary actor he is.  All the other cast members are also wonderful ( especially Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Eric Close) , and you see how fine the set and production values are.  The extras are fascinating  too - especially the commentary for Fall Out.  One slight gripe is that while all the other actors are interviewed on their characters/ favourite episodes, Anthony LaPaglia is noteably absent ... I would have loved to see his take on the complex JAck Malone.

We watched the entire First Season in rapid succession.  It was VERY compelling.""WITHOUT A TRACE"" is a riveting procedural drama about the New York Missing Persons Squad of the FBI. The sole responsibility of this special task force is to find missing persons.They use all kinds of cool tequniques including:psychological profiling.  This techniques peels back the layers of the victims' lives in order to trace their whereabouts.They try to discover whether the person was abducted, murdered, committed suicide or simply ran away.The team reconstructs a ""Day of Disappearance"" timeline that details every minute of the 24 hours prior to the disappearance.They dig into every facet of the victim's life, following one simple rule: learn WHO the victim is in order to learn WHERE the victim is.Senior agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) is tough but compassionate. He is a seasoned and astute professional who heads up the team! His acting is flawless. Lapaglia is my favorite leading male character in a drama!His sqad is comprised of equally talented actors, whose diverse backgrounds and work strategies lend to the shows originality.The team includes:Samantha Spade, an agent whose blonde good looks belie a tough, complex approach to her work.Vivian Johnson , a no-nonsense investigator with a special insight into victims' families.Danny Taylor, whose sensitivity is often covered up by his street smarts.Martin Fitzgerald, who joined the team as a result of his father's connections but has since earned his stripes.As the agents work on varied and complicated cases, details about their own lives continue to unfold.In closing, although the theme of the each show sounds narrow ""FBI searching for missing people"" I promise you each show brings new plot ideas & character growth all of which NEVER feels repetitive.",5,~*  Every Second Counts when someone Vanishes *~,1136419200,"01 5, 2006",2006,2164,"['one', 'reading', 'review', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'episode', 'invite', 'story', 'review', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'lure', 'buying', 'set', 'Just', 'kidding', 'read', 'unsure', 'show', 'husband', 'gave', 'Trace', 'First', 'Season', 'Christmas', 'present', 'can', 'say', 'thank', 'Santa', 'watched', 'entire', 'First', 'Season', 'rapid', 'succession', 'was', 'VERY', 'compelling', 'TRACE', 'riveting', 'procedural', 'drama', 'New', 'York', 'Missing', 'Persons', 'Squad', 'FBI', 'sole', 'responsibility', 'special', 'task', 'force', 'find', 'missing', 'persons.They', 'use', 'kinds', 'cool', 'tequniques', 'including', 'psychological', 'profiling', 'peels', 'back', 'layers', 'victims', 'lives', 'order', 'trace', 'whereabouts.They', 'try', 'discover', 'person', 'was', 'abducted', 'murdered', 'committed', 'suicide', 'simply', 'ran', 'away.The', 'team', 'Day', 'Disappearance', 'timeline', 'details', 'minute', '24', 'hours', 'prior', 'disappearance.They', 'dig', 'facet', 'victim', 'life', 'following', 'one', 'simple', 'rule', 'learn', 'WHO', 'victim', 'order', 'learn', 'WHERE', 'victim', 'is.Senior', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Malone', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'tough', 'compassionate', 'seasoned', 'astute', 'professional', 'who', 'up', 'team', 'acting', 'flawless', 'Lapaglia', 'favorite', 'leading', 'male', 'character', 'drama', 'sqad', 'comprised', 'equally', 'talented', 'actors', 'diverse', 'backgrounds', 'work', 'strategies', 'lend', 'shows', 'originality.The', 'team', 'Samantha', 'Spade', 'agent', 'blonde', 'good', 'looks', 'belie', 'tough', 'complex', 'approach', 'work.Vivian', 'Johnson', 'no-nonsense', 'investigator', 'special', 'insight', 'victims', 'families.Danny', 'Taylor', 'sensitivity', 'often', 'covered', 'up', 'street', 'smarts.Martin', 'Fitzgerald', 'who', 'joined', 'team', 'result', 'father', 'connections', 'earned', 'stripes.As', 'agents', 'work', 'varied', 'complicated', 'cases', 'details', 'own', 'lives', 'continue', 'unfold.In', 'closing', 'theme', 'show', 'narrow', 'FBI', 'searching', 'missing', 'people', 'promise', 'show', 'new', 'plot', 'ideas', 'character', 'growth', 'NEVER', 'feels', 'repetitive']",N/A
831583,AP9RVNCXHB3OB,B0002DRE72,Thayer,"[2, 2]","I cannot believe that I almost missed this wonderful series because of my initial reaction that this is just one the CSI rip-offs. And I am dead wrong, because the two shows are very different shows. WAT `s distinctness is evident as early as the pilot episode with it's tone and where the emphasis of the show is going to be. The show focuses more on the lives of the people involve in the cases. In short the show is more of a why or how as opposed to a show about who. I also watched CSI but personally I think WAT is better. You can watch 6 episodes in a row of WAT and you feel like it's not exactly a time wasted unlike with CSI where you'd get the feeling that you'd spent six hours watching people find for fingerprint and stains.Another strength of the show is that each episode only features single case (as opposed to CSI which usually has 2). Because of that the show really gets to focus into the case and some important moments of the lives involve in the case. They have produce some really moving and affecting episodes. Standout episodes are Pilot, In Exelcis (this is a very good episode, the ending was just perfect especially the flashback), Maple Street (another amazing episode, really moving), Suspect (watch out for Spalding, creepy character), Midnight Sun, Clare de Lune, Hang on to Me (another moving episode, Charles S. Dutton was great), Are You know or have you ever been, and Fall Out. \The cast is led by Anthony Lapaglia who was perfect for the part. The entire supporting cast provide great support and they are given episodes that allow them to stretch their acting skills. Once in awhile we have a glimpse on their own personal lives through the cases that they were working on. I cannot recommend this series enough, for a short period of time I've already fallen in love with the show.Grade: A-",5,Without a Trace,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",2005,1832,"['can', 'not', 'believe', 'almost', 'missed', 'wonderful', 'series', 'initial', 'reaction', 'just', 'one', 'CSI', 'rip-offs', 'am', 'dead', 'wrong', 'two', 'shows', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'shows', 'WAT', 's', 'distinctness', 'evident', 'as', 'early', 'pilot', 'episode', 'tone', 'where', 'emphasis', 'show', 'going', 'be', 'show', 'more', 'lives', 'people', 'involve', 'cases', 'short', 'show', 'more', 'why', 'how', 'as', 'opposed', 'show', 'who', 'also', 'watched', 'CSI', 'personally', 'think', 'WAT', 'better', 'can', 'watch', '6', 'episodes', 'row', 'WAT', 'feel', 'not', 'exactly', 'time', 'wasted', 'CSI', 'where', ""'d"", 'get', 'feeling', ""'d"", 'spent', 'six', 'hours', 'watching', 'people', 'find', 'fingerprint', 'stains.Another', 'strength', 'show', 'episode', 'only', 'single', 'case', 'opposed', 'CSI', 'usually', '2', 'show', 'really', 'focus', 'case', 'important', 'moments', 'lives', 'involve', 'case', 'have', 'produce', 'really', 'moving', 'affecting', 'episodes', 'Standout', 'episodes', 'are', 'Pilot', 'Exelcis', 'very', 'good', 'episode', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'perfect', 'especially', 'flashback', 'Maple', 'Street', 'amazing', 'episode', 'really', 'moving', 'Suspect', 'watch', 'out', 'Spalding', 'creepy', 'character', 'Midnight', 'Sun', 'Clare', 'de', 'Lune', 'Hang', 'Me', 'moving', 'episode', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'was', 'great', 'Are', 'know', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'Fall', 'Out', '\\The', 'cast', 'led', 'Anthony', 'Lapaglia', 'who', 'was', 'perfect', 'part', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'provide', 'great', 'support', 'are', 'given', 'episodes', 'allow', 'stretch', 'acting', 'skills', 'Once', 'awhile', 'have', 'glimpse', 'own', 'personal', 'lives', 'cases', 'were', 'working', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'enough', 'short', 'period', 'time', ""'ve"", 'already', 'fallen', 'love', 'show.Grade', 'A-']",N/A
