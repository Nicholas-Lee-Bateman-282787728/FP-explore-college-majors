729823,A1LOHE2PS10G1G,B00007JZVS,Frank,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed this film more than my friend from Taiwan.  She and I saw a few episodes of a Chinese soap opera years ago, and I understand why she considered this too heavy: there is almost no humor; the chain of misfortunes is unbroken.  This was an important and interesting period in Chinese history, which resonates with me partly since I recall the passion in the voice of a fellow PhD student who told me how she was forced to work in the fields, and ordered to hate her parents.  Another student whose family had a lower profile told me that the Cultural Revolution was like a 4-year vacation for him.The quality of the film is generally good, while it maintains a style of cinematography compatible with its everyman point of view. The acting is excellent.  Its greatest strength is its evocation of the feeling of living during the Cultural Revolution, and the abuses that fell on both good and bad, while opportunists sided with the Party in order to get ahead and to pull down those who used to have more than they did.  A few more touches of the humanity and humor that I have known from PRC emigrees would have made this film more realistic - but I've seen no other film like this one.",4,Historically interesting; dramatically soapy; worth seeing,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",2014,1194,"['enjoyed', 'film', 'more', 'friend', 'Taiwan', 'saw', 'few', 'episodes', 'Chinese', 'soap', 'opera', 'years', 'ago', 'understand', 'why', 'considered', 'too', 'heavy', 'almost', 'humor', 'chain', 'misfortunes', 'unbroken', 'was', 'important', 'interesting', 'period', 'Chinese', 'history', 'partly', 'recall', 'passion', 'voice', 'fellow', 'PhD', 'student', 'who', 'told', 'how', 'was', 'forced', 'work', 'fields', 'ordered', 'hate', 'parents', 'student', 'family', 'had', 'lower', 'profile', 'told', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'was', '4-year', 'vacation', 'him.The', 'quality', 'film', 'generally', 'good', 'style', 'cinematography', 'compatible', 'everyman', 'point', 'view', 'acting', 'excellent', 'greatest', 'strength', 'evocation', 'feeling', 'living', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'abuses', 'fell', 'good', 'bad', 'opportunists', 'sided', 'Party', 'order', 'get', 'ahead', 'pull', 'down', 'who', 'used', 'have', 'more', 'did', 'A', 'few', 'more', 'touches', 'humanity', 'humor', 'have', 'known', 'PRC', 'emigrees', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'more', 'realistic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'other', 'film', 'one']",N/A

729825,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B00007JZVS,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[8, 8]","An important fact is that Zhuangzhuang Tian was barred from making films in China after Blue Kite was released in the United States.  This film was also banned in China after he had received the 1993 Tokyo Grand Prix in the Tokyo International Film Festival.  Blue Kite is a powerful film that displays Tietou's upbringing in Beijing during the beginning of the Communist era when large numbers of people were arrested for different thinking.  The film begins with the birth of Tietou, which is a result of his mothers agony after the death of Stalin.  Tietou's name, Iron Head, is also a tribute to the day Stalin died.  Tietou's family seems happy, however, underneath the audience can feel an undercurrent of worry where people are afraid of expressing their ideas and values.  The reason is that there are frequent messages announced over loud speakers around the neighborhood about ill-fated individuals who have been arrested by the Communist Party for having notions that are against the belief of the party.  During this time, the infant Tietou is growing up and plays on his street with the neighborhood kids.  One day, his kite is flies into a tall tree and gets stuck.  His father, Lin Shaolong, tells Tietou with a strong expression of love and care, ""I can make you another one.""  This is very unusual, since it seems like the social environment in which they live inhibits most people from expressing themselves in any way due to fear of the Communist Party.  Unfortunately, a friend of the family gives Lin Shaolong's name to the Communist Party and he is sent to a reform camp.  In the camp he is accidentally killed, which leaves Tietou and his mother, Chen Shujuan, alone.  However, Tietou is too young to understand the complexity of death and tells his mother to get another ""Happy Old Uncle"".  His mother does so, but it is the same man who gave her husband's name to the Communist Party.  The story repeats itself again as Tietou grows into a teenager.  The audience is delivered a strong message through this daring film that stopped Zhuangzhuang Tian's ability to continue expressing his own notions and feelings on the screen in China.  At the end, an overwhelming flood of sympathy flushes over the viewers through this brilliant cinematic experience.",5,Ones Need to Express Oneself...,1044316800,"02 4, 2003",2003,2277,"['important', 'fact', 'Zhuangzhuang', 'Tian', 'was', 'barred', 'making', 'films', 'China', 'Blue', 'Kite', 'was', 'released', 'United', 'States', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'banned', 'China', 'had', 'received', '1993', 'Tokyo', 'Grand', 'Prix', 'Tokyo', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', 'Blue', 'Kite', 'powerful', 'film', 'Tietou', 'upbringing', 'Beijing', 'beginning', 'Communist', 'era', 'when', 'large', 'numbers', 'people', 'were', 'arrested', 'different', 'thinking', 'film', 'birth', 'Tietou', 'result', 'mothers', 'agony', 'death', 'Stalin', 'Tietou', 'name', 'Iron', 'Head', 'also', 'tribute', 'day', 'Stalin', 'died', 'Tietou', 'family', 'happy', 'however', 'audience', 'can', 'feel', 'undercurrent', 'worry', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'afraid', 'expressing', 'ideas', 'values', 'reason', 'are', 'frequent', 'messages', 'announced', 'loud', 'speakers', 'neighborhood', 'ill-fated', 'individuals', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'arrested', 'Communist', 'Party', 'having', 'notions', 'are', 'belief', 'party', 'time', 'infant', 'Tietou', 'growing', 'up', 'plays', 'street', 'neighborhood', 'kids', 'One', 'day', 'kite', 'flies', 'tall', 'tree', 'stuck', 'father', 'Lin', 'Shaolong', 'Tietou', 'strong', 'expression', 'love', 'care', 'can', 'make', 'one', 'very', 'unusual', 'social', 'environment', 'live', 'inhibits', 'most', 'people', 'expressing', 'way', 'due', 'fear', 'Communist', 'Party', 'Unfortunately', 'friend', 'family', 'Lin', 'Shaolong', 'name', 'Communist', 'Party', 'sent', 'reform', 'camp', 'camp', 'accidentally', 'killed', 'Tietou', 'mother', 'Chen', 'Shujuan', 'alone', 'However', 'Tietou', 'too', 'young', 'understand', 'complexity', 'death', 'mother', 'get', 'Happy', 'Old', 'Uncle', 'mother', 'so', 'same', 'man', 'who', 'gave', 'husband', 'name', 'Communist', 'Party', 'story', 'again', 'Tietou', 'teenager', 'audience', 'delivered', 'strong', 'message', 'daring', 'film', 'stopped', 'Zhuangzhuang', 'Tian', 'ability', 'continue', 'expressing', 'own', 'notions', 'feelings', 'screen', 'China', 'end', 'overwhelming', 'flood', 'sympathy', 'flushes', 'viewers', 'brilliant', 'cinematic', 'experience']",N/A
729826,A37R21F51JT4UF,B00007JZVS,Koreen,"[6, 6]","""The Blue Kite"" is a realistic film about the lives of Chinese families in the hutong, or traditional neighborhoods in Beijing between 1953 and 1968. We get fairly good impressions as to what life was like for children and adults living in courtyard homes that are increasingly being dismantled in Beijing, replaced by modern apartments and stores. We see how families gather around in their courtyard homes to celebrate the Chinese New Year. We also see how Chinese families then, as now, are very close, gathering together during family meals, and how grandparents often helped raise their grandchildren.This film also realistically portrays some of the terrible effects of Mao's policies on ordinary human beings in China. I highly recommend this film and ""To Live"" as being the two best and most realistic films as to how Mao's misguided, perverse policies affected many ordinary, completely innocent human beings, who were working hard to raise their families, enjoying relatively simple lifestyles.The movie is primarily told from the perspective of a child, Tietou. Shujuan, his mother, in the course of the events shown in the film has three husbands. Shalong, Her first husband is falsely accused of being a Rightist in the so-called anti-Rightist campaign, instigated by Mao, during the late 1950's. People in workplaces were pressured to come up with a quota of so-called rightists, who were usually sent to labor camps in the countryside. Shaolong, during a meeting with his colleagues to decide who will be labelled a rightist to placate Communist party bosses, briefly leaves the meeting to go to the bathroom. When he returns, he discovers he has been chosen by the others as being a rightist, to be punished. Shalong is completely innocent and tragically dies from an accident in the labor camp.Tietou has a very difficult time during his childhood, often teased by other boys and he does not get along with his mother's third husband, a high level official who lives in a large, comfortable home. This stepfather is also cruelly tormented by mobs of Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.""The Blue Kite"" is a relatively slow film, but I highly recommend this film because of its realistic portrayal of the daily lives of Chinese people in the hutong during the 1950's and 1960's, as well as being a courageous film by Zhuangzhuang Tian, the director, in exposing how many innocent people greatly suffered because of Mao's cruel, inhumane policies. This is one of the best films ever made about social life in modern China.",5,Very good film about China during 1950's and 1960's,1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,2543,"['Blue', 'Kite', 'realistic', 'film', 'lives', 'Chinese', 'families', 'hutong', 'traditional', 'neighborhoods', 'Beijing', '1953', '1968', 'get', 'fairly', 'good', 'impressions', 'what', 'life', 'was', 'children', 'adults', 'living', 'courtyard', 'homes', 'are', 'increasingly', 'being', 'dismantled', 'Beijing', 'replaced', 'modern', 'apartments', 'stores', 'see', 'how', 'families', 'gather', 'around', 'courtyard', 'homes', 'celebrate', 'Chinese', 'New', 'Year', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'Chinese', 'families', 'then', 'now', 'are', 'very', 'close', 'gathering', 'together', 'family', 'meals', 'how', 'grandparents', 'often', 'helped', 'raise', 'grandchildren.This', 'film', 'also', 'realistically', 'terrible', 'effects', 'Mao', 'policies', 'ordinary', 'human', 'beings', 'China', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'Live', 'being', 'two', 'best', 'most', 'realistic', 'films', 'how', 'Mao', 'misguided', 'perverse', 'policies', 'affected', 'many', 'ordinary', 'completely', 'innocent', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'were', 'working', 'hard', 'raise', 'families', 'enjoying', 'relatively', 'simple', 'lifestyles.The', 'movie', 'primarily', 'told', 'perspective', 'child', 'Tietou', 'Shujuan', 'mother', 'course', 'events', 'shown', 'film', 'three', 'husbands', 'Shalong', 'Her', 'first', 'husband', 'falsely', 'accused', 'being', 'Rightist', 'so-called', 'anti-Rightist', 'campaign', 'instigated', 'Mao', 'late', '1950', 'People', 'workplaces', 'were', 'pressured', 'come', 'up', 'quota', 'so-called', 'rightists', 'who', 'were', 'usually', 'sent', 'labor', 'camps', 'countryside', 'Shaolong', 'meeting', 'colleagues', 'decide', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'labelled', 'rightist', 'placate', 'Communist', 'party', 'bosses', 'briefly', 'meeting', 'go', 'bathroom', 'When', 'been', 'chosen', 'others', 'being', 'rightist', 'be', 'punished', 'Shalong', 'completely', 'innocent', 'tragically', 'dies', 'accident', 'labor', 'camp.Tietou', 'very', 'difficult', 'time', 'childhood', 'often', 'teased', 'other', 'boys', 'not', 'get', 'mother', 'third', 'husband', 'high', 'level', 'official', 'who', 'large', 'comfortable', 'home', 'stepfather', 'also', 'cruelly', 'tormented', 'mobs', 'Red', 'Guards', 'Cultural', 'Revolution', 'Blue', 'Kite', 'relatively', 'slow', 'film', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'daily', 'lives', 'Chinese', 'people', 'hutong', '1950', '1960', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'courageous', 'film', 'Zhuangzhuang', 'Tian', 'director', 'exposing', 'how', 'many', 'innocent', 'people', 'greatly', 'suffered', 'Mao', 'cruel', 'inhumane', 'policies', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'social', 'life', 'modern', 'China']",N/A
