Other than Captain Hunt, Rommie, and Rev Bem, the characters were barely tolerable.  When characters don't take life and death situations seriously, for example, it's hard for the audience to do so.  And, the whole slip-stream deal is just too bizarre.But, season two does have some strong episodes, and the characters have started to mature.  One disappointment is that Rommie is yet another android/non-human trying to be human.  It would have been refreshing if she were either comfortable with emotions from the get-go, or completely non-emotional.Any word on when Season 3 comes out on DVD?  I see that Season 3 ""volumes"" are available.  I don't know anyone insane enough to spend $36 on a few episodes in a ""volume"" when the entire season sells for $56.

Exit StrategiesDylan, Beka, Rev Bem and Tyr, pursued by a gang of Neitzscheans, are forced to make a crash landing on an icy planet.03.  A Heart for Falsehood FramedThe crew of the Andromeda replaces a sacred relic with a fake, attempting to negotiate peace between two battling parties.04.  Pitiless as the SunTrance is held captive, while Dylan and the rest of the crew try to uncover the source behind mysterious attacks on cargo ships05.  Last Call at the Broken HammerDylan leads members of the crew to a desert wasteland in search of a former government leader.06.  All Too HumanRommie discovers prejudices toward A.I.s while attempting to expose the nefarious plots of the Machenites.07.  Una Salas VictusThe crew of the Andromeda battles with the Neitzchean Drago-Kazov pride in an attempt to deliver medical supplies to an ailing colony.08.

This series was originally a Gene Roddenberry idea, however Kevin Sorbo definitely made this his series.  A lot of action and adventure, however there are also some very deep shows that get involved with religion and philosophy.  My wife and I compare this with the first Star Trek series which we still consider the best of the lot.

Season Two delivered.  Of course, I enjoyed all the episodes as the show became sharper technically and wittier in terms of script writing. ""Bunker Hill"" and ""Ouroboros"" stand out as my favorites.  ""Bunker Hill"" because we finally get a look at what is going on on Earth and ""Ouroboros"" because it was a very involved story of twist and turns through the folds of time and space with a few season changing surprises.  The final episode, ""Tunnel at the End of the Light,"" leaves us with intrigue for Season Three.  The only bad thing about this season is the loss of Rev BEM by the third episode.  He was not killed off, he left the show because of the strain of acting in his costume, so maybe we'll see him again briefly next season.

828598,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00029NMNQ,Robert Moore,"[1, 2]","Season One of ANDROMEDA was possibly one of the worst episodes of s space opera ever on television.  I cataloged the long number of problems in my review of Season One and won't repeat them here.  In Season Two the series continued to contain many of the problems that cripple it:  way too many bumpy-headed aliens, too many derivative characters and story lines, weak acting, and weak writing.  But the show improved in Season Two primarily because it started developing more continuity from episode to episode.  It didn't develop much in the way of actual story arcs, but some minor stories, something completely lacking in Season One.I am only now watching the series for the first time so I don't know if the show will take advantage of it, but the one real hope on the show in Season Two was the development of Trance's story.  There had been some minor hints in Season One that there was more to Trance than one might initially think, but this was taken to a whole new level.  Numerous hints have been provided.  That she either can't die or isn't strictly speaking alive.  That she has an undisclosed significance of enormous import.  That if her nature and destiny were known it would endanger the crew.  That she evolves and changes over time (and does in Season Two, dramatically changing her physical appearance).  And we know that there are others like her, at least one of which may have had some very bad effects on a planet.  As of the end of Season two, Trance is the only character on the series who really interests me.I started watching the show because I am currently working my way through every series with robotic, cyborg, artificial, reprogrammed, or technologically enhanced characters.  Unfortunately, the show has done far less with Andromeda than I could have hoped.  The avatar of Andromeda  could be a great character, but the writers after two seasons have barely done anything with her.  I keep hoping that they will.  There was one interesting episode where she helped a man (played by an actor who was one of the Lone Gunmen) where some aspects of her being an android were addressed, but it wasn't the beginning of anything that was ongoing.One of the fun highlights of the season was seeing Kevin Sorbo's sidekick from HERCULES, Michael Hurst, guest stars as an android.  It was just a tad strange seeing the two familiar actors in a completely alien context.One of the crippling things about the show is the weakness of the cast.  Kevin Sorbo is a likable actor, but his character is fairly boring and impossibly traditional in the standard heroic mode.  Tyr has to be one of the worst characters ever on a Sci-fi series.  The problem is the way he is written.  As conceived, he is hopelessly one dimensional.  There is no nunace, no subtlety, and nothing of interest.  If there was one character whose removal from the show would improve it more than any other, it would be Tyr.  Beka is solid but not terribly exciting (though there are times when she physically looks like she could be Kara Thrace's older sister).  Lexa Doig's Andromeda is naturally likable, but they simply do too little with her.  Harper is unrelentlessly irritating.  Which leaves Trance.  In Season Two she becomes increasingly important and my major hope is that she will become even more important in Season Three.In closing, I only wish someone working on the show knew anything whatsoever about Nietzsche.  Hundreds of passages in Nietzsche contradict the crude version of his thought presented in this show.  Nietzscheans seem to have taken nothing from Nietzsche apart from some nutty distortion of the Ubermann.  You certainly don't get the communal cave men you see on the series.  In fact, one of the main words that people used to describe the actual Nietzsche before his mental breakdown was ""polite.""  He was a polite, nice, pleasant man.",3,Huge improvement from Season One,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",2009,3862,"['Season', 'One', 'ANDROMEDA', 'was', 'possibly', 'one', 'worst', 'episodes', 's', 'space', 'opera', 'ever', 'television', 'cataloged', 'long', 'number', 'problems', 'review', 'Season', 'One', 'wo', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'Season', 'Two', 'series', 'continued', 'contain', 'many', 'problems', 'cripple', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'bumpy-headed', 'aliens', 'too', 'many', 'derivative', 'characters', 'story', 'lines', 'weak', 'acting', 'weak', 'writing', 'show', 'improved', 'Season', 'Two', 'primarily', 'started', 'developing', 'more', 'continuity', 'episode', 'episode', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'much', 'way', 'actual', 'story', 'arcs', 'minor', 'stories', 'something', 'completely', 'lacking', 'Season', 'One.I', 'am', 'only', 'now', 'watching', 'series', 'first', 'time', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'show', 'will', 'take', 'advantage', 'one', 'real', 'hope', 'show', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'development', 'Trance', 'story', 'had', 'been', 'minor', 'hints', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'more', 'Trance', 'one', 'might', 'initially', 'think', 'was', 'taken', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'Numerous', 'hints', 'have', 'been', 'provided', 'ca', ""n't"", 'die', ""n't"", 'strictly', 'speaking', 'alive', 'undisclosed', 'significance', 'enormous', 'import', 'nature', 'destiny', 'were', 'known', 'would', 'endanger', 'crew', 'changes', 'time', 'Season', 'Two', 'dramatically', 'changing', 'physical', 'appearance', 'know', 'are', 'others', 'least', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'very', 'bad', 'effects', 'planet', 'end', 'Season', 'two', 'Trance', 'only', 'character', 'series', 'who', 'really', 'interests', 'me.I', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'am', 'currently', 'working', 'way', 'series', 'robotic', 'cyborg', 'artificial', 'reprogrammed', 'technologically', 'enhanced', 'characters', 'Unfortunately', 'show', 'done', 'far', 'less', 'Andromeda', 'could', 'have', 'hoped', 'avatar', 'Andromeda', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'character', 'writers', 'two', 'seasons', 'have', 'barely', 'done', 'anything', 'keep', 'hoping', 'will', 'was', 'one', 'interesting', 'episode', 'where', 'helped', 'man', 'played', 'actor', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'Lone', 'Gunmen', 'where', 'aspects', 'being', 'android', 'were', 'addressed', 'was', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'anything', 'was', 'ongoing.One', 'fun', 'highlights', 'season', 'was', 'seeing', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'sidekick', 'HERCULES', 'Michael', 'Hurst', 'guest', 'stars', 'android', 'was', 'just', 'tad', 'strange', 'seeing', 'two', 'familiar', 'actors', 'completely', 'alien', 'context.One', 'crippling', 'things', 'show', 'weakness', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Sorbo', 'likable', 'actor', 'character', 'fairly', 'boring', 'impossibly', 'traditional', 'standard', 'heroic', 'mode', 'Tyr', 'be', 'one', 'worst', 'characters', 'ever', 'Sci-fi', 'series', 'problem', 'way', 'written', 'conceived', 'hopelessly', 'one', 'dimensional', 'nunace', 'subtlety', 'nothing', 'interest', 'was', 'one', 'character', 'removal', 'show', 'would', 'improve', 'more', 'other', 'would', 'be', 'Tyr', 'Beka', 'solid', 'not', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'physically', 'could', 'be', 'Kara', 'Thrace', 'older', 'sister', 'Lexa', 'Doig', 'Andromeda', 'naturally', 'likable', 'simply', 'do', 'too', 'little', 'Harper', 'unrelentlessly', 'irritating', 'Which', 'Trance', 'Season', 'Two', 'increasingly', 'important', 'major', 'hope', 'will', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'important', 'Season', 'Three.In', 'closing', 'only', 'wish', 'someone', 'working', 'show', 'knew', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'Nietzsche', 'Hundreds', 'passages', 'Nietzsche', 'contradict', 'crude', 'version', 'thought', 'presented', 'show', 'Nietzscheans', 'seem', 'have', 'taken', 'nothing', 'Nietzsche', 'apart', 'nutty', 'distortion', 'Ubermann', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'communal', 'cave', 'men', 'see', 'series', 'fact', 'one', 'main', 'words', 'people', 'used', 'describe', 'actual', 'Nietzsche', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'was', 'polite', 'was', 'polite', 'nice', 'pleasant', 'man']",N/A

There isn't really a lot of introspection or moral dilemmas going on here. Everyone knows what they want, and they are all trying to out-maneuver each other into getting it. Andromeda is the anti-Buffy.Season 2 adds a bit of wire-fu to the show (to great effect in the Matrix-y episode &quot;All Too Human&quot;) and the special effects team seem to have gotten a great deal on sparklers. There are still lots of Nietzschian machinations, and Tyr and Dylan go head to head a few times, including in what is probably the best episode of the series, &quot;The Prince&quot;. There is also quite a bit of continuity in the episodes, and minor points in one show becomes the focus of another.Trance makes a change for the serious, and the writers finally figure out what to do with Rev (ship him out).ADV perpetually overcharges for all their single-episode disks. I have long given up buying them, and instead wait (and wait...) for the box sets. Note that in this set, you get 5 double-sided disks instead of the 10 single sided disks you would have if you bought them individually. It doesn't match the first season set, but it does save a bit of shelf space. The user interface is a lot better, but now the disk is front-loaded with commercials.",5,"Great show, and (now) at a great price",1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,1543,"['Andromeda', 'fun', 'show', ""n't"", 'have', 'characters', 'sense', 'quot', 'character', 'study', 'quot', 'characters', 'sense', 'quot', 'Boy', 'guy', 'character', 'quot', 'Dylan', 'Beka', 'purple', 'Trance', 'Rommy', 'Tyr', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Harper', 'smile', 'time', 'mouth', ""n't"", 'really', 'lot', 'introspection', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'going', 'here', 'Everyone', 'what', 'want', 'are', 'trying', 'out-maneuver', 'other', 'getting', 'Andromeda', 'anti-Buffy.Season', '2', 'bit', 'wire-fu', 'show', 'great', 'effect', 'Matrix-y', 'episode', 'quot', 'All', 'Too', 'Human', 'quot', 'special', 'effects', 'team', 'seem', 'have', 'gotten', 'great', 'deal', 'sparklers', 'are', 'still', 'lots', 'Nietzschian', 'machinations', 'Tyr', 'Dylan', 'go', 'head', 'head', 'few', 'times', 'including', 'what', 'probably', 'best', 'episode', 'series', 'quot', 'Prince', 'quot', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'continuity', 'episodes', 'minor', 'points', 'one', 'show', 'focus', 'another.Trance', 'change', 'serious', 'writers', 'finally', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'Rev', 'ship', 'out', '.ADV', 'perpetually', 'overcharges', 'single-episode', 'disks', 'have', 'long', 'given', 'up', 'buying', 'instead', 'wait', 'wait', 'box', 'sets', 'Note', 'set', 'get', '5', 'double-sided', 'disks', 'instead', '10', 'single', 'sided', 'disks', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'individually', ""n't"", 'match', 'first', 'season', 'set', 'save', 'bit', 'shelf', 'space', 'user', 'interface', 'lot', 'better', 'now', 'disk', 'front-loaded', 'commercials']",N/A
