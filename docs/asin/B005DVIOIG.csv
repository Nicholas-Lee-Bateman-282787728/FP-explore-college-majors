1456149,A2QHM5HBSIXRL4,B005DVIOIG,Andy Orrock,"[1, 1]","This BBC production is notable for its excellent cast, knife-edge plotting and brutal depictions of crimes and depravity.  In particular, the two-episode arc of Idris Elba's Luther tracking Lee Ingleby's Cameron is at times gruesome and harrowing.  But the writing and staging is so perfectly executed, you can't look away.There's nothing low-rent, contrived or cheap about 'Luther'.  It's first-class stuff all the way - cast, crew, writers, production.  It has the feel of a top-run motion picture.  The tight four-episode arc of Season 2 means there's not a moment to waste.  There's nary a single scene of throwaway fluff...or even of lighter material for the players (and its audience) to draw a breath.For me, Season Two's standout is Aimee-Ffion Edwards as the young prostitute/slave Jenny.  Luther is compelled to rescue Jenny, thereby stepping into a devilish world of blackmail, backstabbing (or, more appropriate here, hand-stabbing) and violence.  Turns out 'rescuing' Jenny is fraught with blow-back.  And, as the danger and the stakes grow more dire, the relationship between Luther and Jenny deepens.  A highlight for me: given a small bit of light in her live, Jenny brings home a small gift for Luther.  Though it's brutally intercepted, it's revealed to be a framed photo of David Bowie performing.  I'd just read that Elba is a huge Bowie fan, so this little nod to his real-life likes thrilled me.

If you sneak into the back seat of a cop's personal car in LA with your scary knife, they'll plug you with their gun.  Because, I think you'll find a bullet will travel through upholstery with greater ease than that knife will.  In short, what kind of lame cop gets kidnapped by a guy holding a knife on him in the back seat of a car?

1456178,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B005DVIOIG,DVD Verdict,"[2, 3]","Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --The initial premise of Luther was almost amusingly conventional: a detective is great at his job, but struggles with quite a few issues in his personal life? And he has a different case to solve every week? We've only seen that show a few thousand times at this point. However, the first season of Luther quickly established a number of elements that permitted it to stand out as its own beast. First and foremost was the relationship between Luther and devilish killer Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson, The Prisoner), which offered an entertaining variation on the Hannibal Lecter/Clarice Starling dynamic. Despite their obvious differences of opinion on the law and, y'know, whether it's cool to just kill people, the fact that the two understand each other is often enough to outweigh all of that. It's an unlikely relationship which is nearly impossible to believe at times, but Elba and Wilson make it work.One major improvement between this season and the last: the done-in-one plots have been substituted with more protracted cases, giving Luther 2 the feeling of being a proper miniseries rather than just a collection of episodes. The first two episodes focus on the masked killer, the latter two episodes focus on the role playing killer, and Luther's attempts to aid a troubled young woman (along with a handful of other, smaller subplots) take the entire season to resolve. As a result, the show feels bigger, more cinematic and the inevitable showdowns manage to achieve a greater weight than before.Luther arrives on DVD sporting a handsome transfer. The level of detail is impressive, blacks are deep and inky and flesh tones are warm and natural. The four episodes are spread across two discs, and the transfer seems to benefit from this fact (many TV show discs are stuffed to maximum capacity with content). Audio is also exceptional, with the musical score playing an even more prominent role in this season (there's some Howard Shore-inspired material in the first two episodes which is positively thunderous). Audio is clean and clear, and the sound design is solid enough.

She does appear in the first two episodes (briefly) but really doesn't tie into the plot. And the absence of that central character does leave a hole in the show.Other than that, it's largely business as usual with Luther perpetually skirting the line of legality and sometimes crossing well over.The acting is top to bottom good in Luther, but particularly in season two, the selling point is Idris Elba.

Season two (2) of ""Luther"" continues the excellence that the first season began.  My god, season two (2) is so well written, directed and so fabulously acted.Although many of the ""support characters"" from Season one (1) are gone in Season two (2, the ""new crop"" of characters are really very, very good outstandingly helping Luther  (wonderfully and intently acted by Idris Elba) solve some really horrific cases that are filled with many nasty and frightening villains.  Luther, in his very brave and ""short fused"" manner, solves some really baffling cases in Season two (2) always putting himself in extremely dangerous positions.  He is really a very intuitive detective again in this season enduring some very cruel to himself situations while dealing with some intense personal ""demons"" of his own including his very strong attraction to Alice the  ""nemesis type"" character that he knows is a psychopath well capable of murder. (please note that Pam Ferris of ""Rosemary and Thyme"" makes a wonderful brief apperance in a sub-plot acting a very mean Madam/grandmother wonderfully until she is threatened with the wrath of Alice)YES, my favorite character from Season One (1) is back in Season two (2) albeit shortly.  Luther's ""match"" and nemesis is shortly back and because of his strong attraction to her, she's back to drive him ""nuts"" and offer some temptation to get away from the ""madness"" and escape to more craziness with her.  Alice (acted brilliantly by Ruth Wilson) is in a mental institution in Season two (2) that she, of course, manages to escape from torturing Luther unmercifully.  Their scenes together are so very awesome--they truly ""ignite"" the screen.  I just love the characters of Alice and Luther that are so splendidly acted by Ruth Wilson and Idris Elba,  In fact,  all of the characters in Season two (2) are fantastically acted.  Of the ""new"" characters that I really adore is the assistant DCI to Luther that is acted greatly by Nikki Amuka-Bird--she is always questioning Luther's motives,Although Season two (2) has only four episodes on two (2) discs, this season is really very good and I am very glad that my wish for another season came true because I was highly entertained by Season two (2).(I must add that the direction is really good.

They will not be disappointed.Except by the amount of episodes. Call me a critic, but I don't consider 4 episodes of anything a ""season."" It's a month of weekly programming. The good news is this is Luther, and those minutes of those hours count. Idris Elba deserved every award he got for acting this role. Ruth Wilson, as the femme fatale, is much sexier acting like an English lady than a lot of actresses are dressing in bikinis and trying to be sex kittens. Minor characters are well drawn. Frank, a goon for the mafia, gets as much characterization as any of the protagonists on criminal minds have gotten in six seasons. This characterization occurs in the course of about 15 minutes. That's Luther in a nutshell, a parsimonious elevation of the crime procedural.I was a tad bit disappointed that Alice didn't have more screen time. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Any pair of adult friends isn't going to be pinned by the hip, if the relationship is true. Wilson and Elba have great chemistry, and Wilson's presence in scarce scenes is phenomenal, to the point she can realistically serve as a literary solution in an episode she's not in.Four episodes though...

1456187,A31P94HJVZ6WRF,B005DVIOIG,HeroicTimes,"[16, 38]","Well, if you're reading this review and have seen the first series of LUTHER, and are making up your mind regarding purchasing series 2, possibly this review can assist.Season 1 ended on a cliffhanger, so more than likely you're going to want to eventually see how that cliffhanger plays out in season 2.The only real question being whether you purchase the DVD, rent the DVD, or borrow a friend's DVD.Which one you're inclined to, depends on how much you liked season 1.Season 1 was 6 episodes, and I thought the first 4 episodes were FANTASTIC, but in the 5th episode it goes off the rails, nicking its twist from a popular US show (the same thing would happen in season 2, a popular US crime show idea/storyline, 'borrowed' for the twist).From that twist on Neil Cross' writing devolves into cliche, and wild irrationaliaty, indeed stupidity that mars the entire end of Season 1. That cliched writing, and irrationality unfortunately not only continues in Season 2, but escalates (season 2 by the way being only a very brief 4 episodes, another thing to consider before shelling out for this expensive, and featureless 2 disc set)So if like myself you felt the ending of Season 1 was poorly done, you'll feel the same about the entirety of season 2, especially most of the new additions to the cast. However if you thought the cliffhanger of season 1 was good, well you're in for more of the same.For a full review go here:heroictimes at wordpress dot comMy vote: While I do recommend owning season 1 (even though it drops the ball, it's first four episodes make up for it), I can't say the same thing about season 2. Don't pay to buy it, don't even pay to rent it, borrow it from a friend.(If you do insist on buying, even with shipping it's cheaper to buy it from Amazon UK, then paying the marked up US prices)Hope this has helped.",2,A writer's steep fall from grace,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",2011,1837,"['Well', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'have', 'seen', 'first', 'series', 'LUTHER', 'are', 'making', 'up', 'mind', 'regarding', 'purchasing', 'series', '2', 'possibly', 'review', 'can', 'assist.Season', '1', 'ended', 'cliffhanger', 'so', 'more', 'likely', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'eventually', 'see', 'how', 'cliffhanger', 'out', 'season', '2.The', 'only', 'real', 'question', 'being', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'rent', 'DVD', 'borrow', 'friend', 'DVD.Which', 'one', ""'re"", 'inclined', 'how', 'much', 'liked', 'season', '1.Season', '1', 'was', '6', 'episodes', 'thought', 'first', '4', 'episodes', 'were', 'FANTASTIC', '5th', 'episode', 'rails', 'nicking', 'twist', 'popular', 'US', 'show', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'happen', 'season', '2', 'popular', 'US', 'crime', 'show', 'idea/storyline', ""'borrowed"", 'twist', 'twist', 'Neil', 'Cross', 'writing', 'devolves', 'cliche', 'wild', 'irrationaliaty', 'indeed', 'stupidity', 'entire', 'end', 'Season', '1', 'cliched', 'writing', 'irrationality', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'only', 'Season', '2', 'escalates', 'season', '2', 'way', 'being', 'only', 'very', 'brief', '4', 'episodes', 'thing', 'consider', 'shelling', 'out', 'expensive', 'featureless', '2', 'disc', 'set', 'So', 'felt', 'ending', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'poorly', 'done', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'same', 'entirety', 'season', '2', 'especially', 'most', 'new', 'additions', 'cast', 'However', 'thought', 'cliffhanger', 'season', '1', 'was', 'good', 'well', ""'re"", 'more', 'same.For', 'full', 'review', 'go', 'here', 'heroictimes', 'wordpress', 'dot', 'comMy', 'vote', 'do', 'recommend', 'owning', 'season', '1', 'even', 'ball', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'season', '2', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'buy', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'pay', 'rent', 'borrow', 'friend', 'do', 'insist', 'buying', 'even', 'shipping', 'cheaper', 'buy', 'Amazon', 'UK', 'then', 'paying', 'marked', 'up', 'US', 'prices', 'Hope', 'helped']",Luther: Season 2

This BBC series is so on the edge and so different than other police dramas that we need more LUTHER.Idris Elba is a Class A actor. His portrayal of the honest and dedicated but deeply troubled DCI John Luther is remarkable. He is John Luther and the role seemed to have been made for him. We see some cast changes in Season 2...most notably the addition of Nikki Amuka-Bird as the young and idealistic DS Erin Gray. DS Justin Ripley is still Luther's number one fan and admirer. Ripley knows he can trust Luther's judgement no matter what as Gray begins to suspect Luther's honesty and motives.Season 2 seems darker and more intense as we dig deeper into Luther's psyche. Season 1 dealt strongly with his relationship with his estranged wife and the relationship ended in tragedy. Luther is rebuilding his life and begins to wonder if being a cop is still his passion.Although Ruth Wilson is back as the psycopath Alice Morgan, we don't see very much of her in Series 2. Alice Morgan is one of the most fascinating characters on television and her relationship with Luther was obsessive and bizarre. Only Alice seems to have some understanding of Luther's inner mind.LUTHER is fresh and exciting. It's a few steps above other police detective series. Stories overlap in the 4 episodes mostly Luther's relationship with a very troubled Jenny Jones. Despite his misgivings, Luther heeds Jenny's mother's call for help. Now Luther has gotten himself very deep in a personal mess that could ruin his career and jeopardize the lives of others. His personal problems can't interfere with tracking down the latest criminal or killer. In the last episode, a strange killer suddenly attacks without warning..a twisted and unsual story.This show is truly police drama at its best with top actors and amazingly crisp writer.

1456201,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005DVIOIG,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[17, 18]","After a hugely successful run in its first six hours, BBC's ""Luther"" returns for another go with four more episodes.  Some have contended that ""Luther"" is unlike any other show on TV, and I'm not entirely sure that I would agree with this assessment.  While ""Luther"" can certainly be wild and unpredictable, it is not breaking the mold of many other rogue cop hero shows that have populated the modern TV landscape. As the titular Detective John Luther, Idris Elba brings much passion, conviction, and gusto to the standard role of a cop who must sometimes cross the line to do what's right. But to the program's credit, Elba can be extremely erratic as well and does push the notion of a ""good"" cop to an uncomfortable, and at times, violent level.  It is this anything-may-happen feel that livens up even the most standard of cases.  By the end of Season One, Luther had become absolutely unhinged and Elba had served up a performance that would be nominated for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe award.Season Two (again, this is only 4 episodes) may not be quite as strong as the previous offering, but it is still solidly entertaining television.  The first two episodes deal with a serial murderer who liked to broadcast his crimes, while the last two dealt with a sociopath's increasingly violent crime spree.  Of these two, the second was my favorite--as the case was twice as complicated as anyone suspected and the grisly crimes were, literally, being decided on the roll of a dice.  There was such a palpable sense of randomness, the danger and tension were ratcheted up considerably.  Both had their highpoints and both had moments of implausibility, but the show is done with such conviction--it's hard not to get wrapped up in the mayhem.  Over the entire second season, there is also a continuing subplot where Luther is asked to rescue a young woman from the seedy world of adult entertainment which gets our hero in deep water with some nefarious criminal types.  I'm not sure that all of this was entirely effective, but it did give Elba a chance to showcase a softer side (albeit only marginally).For me, the element that made Season One so great was its leading lady Ruth Wilson.  As a psychopath who develops an unsettling bond with Luther, every scene that they shared was elevated to exquisite uncomfortableness.  It was brilliantly acted, written and refreshingly daring for series television.  Wilson does appear in Season Two in a more abbreviated performance.  It's still fantastic, but when she was gone--I absolutely missed her!  Aside from Elba and Wilson, Nikki Amuka-Bird turns in some strong work as a detective who is wary of Luther's reputation and Warren Brown's role gets expanded as Luther's strongest advocate who finds himself in harm's way.  While I preferred Season One, this is still an easy recommendation for fans.  And if you haven't seen any of ""Luther,"" treat yourself and start at the beginning.  Solidly entertaining throughout.

But bbc shows can alternate between a few episodes and 13 or even 20.  Most are 6 eps though and this one is a basically two stories told over 4 eps. Where Luthor battles crime and being blackmailed because he feels the need to battle evil. The show is excellent and sometimes rather way out there even!  But who cares you get a awesome lead actor and a fine supporting cast too. The dvd looks great as this is a 2011 miniseries. Like all bbc dvd's though this one is costly. The bbc could sell alot more dvds if they'd price them around 20.00! or less for these smaller series.  Oh well, this show should have had a fuller series , so for the two star reviewer , it is a series. That's the bbc for you.  A four episode series of a hit show!

1456212,ABQ8OE2IFK192,B005DVIOIG,Michael J. Irise,"[0, 0]","This season was watched more like a prequel. After watching season 3, I was wondering how we got to that point. Season 1 introduces you to the main character Luther played by Idris Elba. He is quite a conflicted person dealing with a multitude of issues, oh and investigating cases also. Good series to watch if you're into police shows. It brings the UK, particularly London's police, and the way they handle cases. Interesting to note, the first line &#34;Coppers&#34; don't carry guns!!The second season begins where season 1 leaves off and continues with all it's twists and turns!!",5,Interesting twists,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,586,"['season', 'was', 'watched', 'more', 'prequel', 'watching', 'season', '3', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'got', 'point', 'Season', '1', 'introduces', 'main', 'character', 'Luther', 'played', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'quite', 'conflicted', 'person', 'dealing', 'multitude', 'issues', 'oh', 'investigating', 'cases', 'also', 'Good', 'series', 'watch', ""'re"", 'police', 'shows', 'UK', 'particularly', 'London', 'police', 'way', 'handle', 'cases', 'Interesting', 'note', 'first', 'line', '34', 'Coppers', '34', 'do', ""n't"", 'carry', 'guns', 'second', 'season', 'where', 'season', '1', 'off', 'twists']",Luther: Season 2
1456213,A3FJSHVW02YAK3,B005DVIOIG,Michael S.,"[0, 0]","There are subtle differences between season one and season two that knock the latter collection down a notch. For one, season two consists of just four episodes, but they were originally set up as two hour blocks, so the first two episodes share the same main story, as does the next two episodes. This means that only two cases are worked in the second season. In addition, the previous police division that Luther was a part of was closed down, so Luther now works for a newly formed division run by former internal affairs-style nemesis Schenk. Although Schenk is much better in the role of division head than Teller from last season, and Ripley returns as Luther's partner (expanding on their relationship from the first season), the newly added DS Gray is an annoying and unnecessary character who never fully develops due to the short season length. Additionally, moving from the old police building into a newer building that's more reminiscent of office cubicles takes away from the atmosphere and character of the original setting.Two other problems with the show reduce its emotional effectiveness. Alice is only present in two episodes, and although her and Luther's complicated relationship continues to grow, she wasn't involved in the investigation at all, and didn't receive nearly enough screen time. Also, with the death of Luther's wife in the first season, the new underlying story of Luther's attempt to rescue Jenny lacks the impact of the Zoe storyline, and the characters aren't very likeable. We also aren't given any idea why Alice was sent to a mental institution for killing Ian Reed last season, considering that she saved Luther's life in the process. With the Jenny storyline, we're only given a small look at why Luther would even care about the plight of her and her mother.Despite these detractions, season two is still a great ride. Idris Elba continues his fantastic portrayal of Luther, and the major villains are every bit as creepy as the first season.",4,"A step down from season one, but still great",1358899200,"01 23, 2013",2013,1990,"['are', 'subtle', 'differences', 'season', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'knock', 'latter', 'collection', 'down', 'notch', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'consists', 'just', 'four', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'set', 'up', 'two', 'hour', 'blocks', 'first', 'two', 'episodes', 'share', 'same', 'main', 'story', 'next', 'two', 'episodes', 'only', 'two', 'cases', 'are', 'worked', 'second', 'season', 'addition', 'previous', 'police', 'division', 'Luther', 'was', 'part', 'was', 'closed', 'down', 'Luther', 'now', 'newly', 'formed', 'division', 'run', 'former', 'internal', 'affairs-style', 'nemesis', 'Schenk', 'Schenk', 'much', 'better', 'role', 'division', 'head', 'Teller', 'last', 'season', 'Ripley', 'returns', 'Luther', 'partner', 'expanding', 'relationship', 'first', 'season', 'newly', 'added', 'DS', 'Gray', 'annoying', 'unnecessary', 'character', 'who', 'never', 'fully', 'due', 'short', 'season', 'length', 'Additionally', 'moving', 'old', 'police', 'building', 'newer', 'building', 'more', 'reminiscent', 'office', 'cubicles', 'away', 'atmosphere', 'character', 'original', 'setting.Two', 'other', 'problems', 'show', 'reduce', 'emotional', 'effectiveness', 'Alice', 'only', 'present', 'two', 'episodes', 'Luther', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'grow', 'was', ""n't"", 'involved', 'investigation', 'did', ""n't"", 'receive', 'nearly', 'enough', 'screen', 'time', 'Also', 'death', 'Luther', 'wife', 'first', 'season', 'new', 'underlying', 'story', 'Luther', 'attempt', 'rescue', 'Jenny', 'impact', 'Zoe', 'storyline', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'likeable', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'given', 'idea', 'why', 'Alice', 'was', 'sent', 'mental', 'institution', 'killing', 'Ian', 'Reed', 'last', 'season', 'considering', 'saved', 'Luther', 'life', 'process', 'Jenny', 'storyline', ""'re"", 'only', 'given', 'small', 'look', 'why', 'Luther', 'would', 'even', 'care', 'plight', 'mother.Despite', 'detractions', 'season', 'two', 'still', 'great', 'ride', 'Idris', 'Elba', 'fantastic', 'portrayal', 'Luther', 'major', 'villains', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'creepy', 'first', 'season']",Luther: Season 2
