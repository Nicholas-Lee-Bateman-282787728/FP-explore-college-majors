495242,A2KB01ZCNIZQFQ,B000008TX3,Sunny in DC,"[2, 2]","This is a truly magnificent production of the classic Beatrix Potter stories and the animation is very true to the original illustrations. Each episode opens with a live action scene of Ms. Potter writing a letter and imparting a story that opens into the animation. The opening music is lovely and the production well done. The stories are well animated and give you a feeling of stepping back into another time and another world. However, not all episodes went over well with my young children. The Tale of Pigling Bland was my children's least favorite episode and there are a few episodes that truly frightened my children, who were nearly 3 and 5 the first time they watched it. (For example, a very large rat almost makes kitten pie.) Over a year later and my 6 year old is no longer scared but my 4 year old still cannot watch some of the episodes.I should note that my kids are all girls and sometimes easily frightened. My friend brought her 5 year old son to watch the series and the programs did not tend to hold his interest, except when my kids were scared, then he was fascinated and thought it was funny...All in all, this is a very well produced, well animated series. As my kids get older, I think they will truly enjoy the DVDs. I certainly do.",5,"Beautiful collection, but might be a little scary for little ones",1120694400,"07 7, 2005",2005,1262,"['truly', 'magnificent', 'production', 'classic', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'stories', 'animation', 'very', 'true', 'original', 'illustrations', 'episode', 'live', 'action', 'scene', 'Ms.', 'Potter', 'writing', 'letter', 'imparting', 'story', 'animation', 'opening', 'music', 'lovely', 'production', 'well', 'done', 'stories', 'are', 'well', 'animated', 'give', 'feeling', 'stepping', 'back', 'time', 'world', 'However', 'not', 'episodes', 'went', 'over', 'well', 'young', 'children', 'Tale', 'Pigling', 'Bland', 'was', 'children', 'least', 'favorite', 'episode', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'truly', 'frightened', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'nearly', '3', '5', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'example', 'very', 'large', 'rat', 'almost', 'kitten', 'pie', 'year', 'later', '6', 'year', 'old', 'no', 'longer', 'scared', '4', 'year', 'old', 'still', 'can', 'not', 'watch', 'episodes.I', 'should', 'note', 'kids', 'are', 'girls', 'sometimes', 'easily', 'frightened', 'friend', 'brought', '5', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'watch', 'series', 'programs', 'did', 'not', 'tend', 'hold', 'interest', 'when', 'kids', 'were', 'scared', 'then', 'was', 'fascinated', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'very', 'well', 'produced', 'well', 'animated', 'series', 'kids', 'get', 'older', 'think', 'will', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'DVDs', 'certainly', 'do']",N/A
495243,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000008TX3,Z Hayes,"[4, 4]","This is a boxed set containing two DVDs - one contains The Tale of Two Bad Mice and Johnny Town Mouse, The Tale of Mrs Tiggy-Winkle and Mr Jeremy Fisher, and The Tailor of Gloucester, whilst the other DVD contains The Tale of Peter Rabbit and Benjamin Bunny, and The Tale of Mr Tod. A value buy indeed [and you can even get them cheaper if you go to stores like Half-Price Books where I got mine].The animation is superb - it's like Beatrix Potter's illustrations have been brought to life, and the effects are simply enchanting. I also like the introduction bit to the actual stories - there is an actress portraying Beatrix Potter, in period costume, painting on a hillside with a magnificent view...it starts to rain, and she scrambles for her things before heading home. The home scene is equally enchanting as there is a fire burning, and the actress sits down at her desk [with a real rabbit as her pet] to write a letter to her relative. I thought the whole production was of high quality and well-done, and of course the tales themselves are true to the spirit of Beatrix Potter's stories of little animals in situations of mischief, danger, and general merry-making. A wonderful collection for Beatrix Potter fans, and little ones [my three-year old loves them!].",5,A delightful box set that is sure to enchant!,1211673600,"05 25, 2008",2008,1272,"['boxed', 'set', 'containing', 'two', 'DVDs', 'one', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Bad', 'Mice', 'Johnny', 'Town', 'Mouse', 'Tale', 'Mrs', 'Tiggy-Winkle', 'Mr', 'Jeremy', 'Fisher', 'Tailor', 'Gloucester', 'whilst', 'other', 'DVD', 'Tale', 'Peter', 'Rabbit', 'Benjamin', 'Bunny', 'Tale', 'Mr', 'Tod', 'A', 'value', 'buy', 'indeed', '[', 'can', 'even', 'get', 'cheaper', 'go', 'stores', 'Half-Price', 'Books', 'where', 'got', 'mine', ']', '.The', 'animation', 'superb', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'illustrations', 'have', 'been', 'brought', 'life', 'effects', 'are', 'simply', 'enchanting', 'also', 'introduction', 'bit', 'actual', 'stories', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'period', 'costume', 'painting', 'hillside', 'magnificent', 'view', 'rain', 'things', 'heading', 'home', 'home', 'scene', 'equally', 'enchanting', 'fire', 'burning', 'actress', 'down', 'desk', '[', 'real', 'rabbit', 'pet', ']', 'write', 'letter', 'relative', 'thought', 'whole', 'production', 'was', 'high', 'quality', 'well-done', 'course', 'tales', 'are', 'true', 'spirit', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'stories', 'little', 'animals', 'situations', 'mischief', 'danger', 'general', 'merry-making', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'Beatrix', 'Potter', 'fans', 'little', 'ones', 'three-year', 'old', ']']",N/A
