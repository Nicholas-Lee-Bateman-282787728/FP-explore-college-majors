It is a documentary made of video clips made during the childhood of the narrators. The, now adult, narrators provide explanation for this collection of videos. The wonderful thing is that there seems to be very little censorship of their material. The honesty and openness with which they share their childhood videos is somewhat surprising seeing as most people would be too embarrassed to be so open. The result is a realistic portrayal of childhood in the 1980's. They remind me a lot of kids I knew when I was growing up. But, allow me to repeat myself for the sake of emphasis, the surprising thing isn't so much what the kids do on video, but the fact that these videos wound up being shared with the general public. I see a lot of value in this sort of presentation, but I also fear that some people might find it disturbing. With the increased availability of video equipment, could there be more of this sort of thing in the future?",5,Honest Realism,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1050,"['movie', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'last', 'couple', 'years', 'documentary', 'made', 'video', 'clips', 'made', 'childhood', 'narrators', 'now', 'adult', 'narrators', 'provide', 'explanation', 'collection', 'videos', 'wonderful', 'thing', 'be', 'very', 'little', 'censorship', 'material', 'honesty', 'openness', 'share', 'childhood', 'videos', 'somewhat', 'surprising', 'seeing', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'so', 'open', 'result', 'realistic', 'portrayal', 'childhood', '1980', 'remind', 'lot', 'kids', 'knew', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', 'allow', 'repeat', 'sake', 'emphasis', 'surprising', 'thing', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'what', 'kids', 'do', 'video', 'fact', 'videos', 'wound', 'up', 'being', 'shared', 'general', 'public', 'see', 'lot', 'value', 'sort', 'presentation', 'also', 'fear', 'people', 'might', 'find', 'disturbing', 'increased', 'availability', 'video', 'equipment', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'sort', 'thing', 'future']",Put the Camera on Me

Why would anyone want to watch 2 hours of the boring idle lives a bunch of spoiled Southern California suburban youngsters hanging around their swimming pools and protected little cul-de-sac life playing pretend? Now if you think that's boring, we get interviews with these grown up kids and their parents reminiscing about the videos, as if anybody except themselves gave a dingle dangle how these spoiled brats passed their lives of idleness and self-gratification anyway.Particularly irritating is watching Darren Stein, who seemed to be the star of this DVD. IN the videos we see Darren as an pretty little boy with a angelic face that hid a manipulative and slightly twisted personality. The interviews with the adult Darren, it becomes apparent that Darren leveraged his control of the camera as means of instigating a series of intrigues among his playmates, to which he derived a sense of amusement. This manipulation extended to his own parents to whom he used the skits to out his gay identity to them.Perhaps the Documentary does have a message---that the camera is a form of manipulation and creates it's own reality. And may be a source of corruption of the culture. But students of media already know this, and we didn't need this outrageous piece of personal vanity of a documentary to explain it to us.Does the Stein family actually believe that this hodge-podge of home-made videos is something special? You can find more creative stuff on YouTube these days. These home movies were made by a bunch of upper middle class suburban kids, documenting the sort make believe that kids do all the time to amuse themselves. Despite what the narcissistic, self absorbed Stein family thinks, this is NOT high art, or even unique or creative. The only unique thing is that the Stein father was wealthy enough to provide his spoiled youngsters with a video camera back in the 80's amateur video cameras were too expensive for middle class families to afford.I'd definately advise you to PASS on this stupid and uninspiring momument to a rich family's momument to their own narcissism.",1,Stupid home movies not worth watching unless you enjoy torturing yourself...,1189209600,"09 8, 2007",2007,2176,"['was', 'impulse', 'rental', 'did', 'regret', 'renting', 'Monument-to-Vanity', 'stinker', 'Why', 'would', 'anyone', 'want', 'watch', '2', 'hours', 'boring', 'idle', 'bunch', 'spoiled', 'Southern', 'California', 'suburban', 'youngsters', 'hanging', 'swimming', 'pools', 'protected', 'little', 'cul-de-sac', 'life', 'playing', 'pretend', 'Now', 'think', 'boring', 'get', 'interviews', 'grown', 'up', 'kids', 'parents', 'reminiscing', 'videos', 'anybody', 'gave', 'dingle', 'dangle', 'how', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'passed', 'lives', 'idleness', 'self-gratification', 'anyway.Particularly', 'irritating', 'watching', 'Darren', 'Stein', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'star', 'DVD', 'IN', 'videos', 'see', 'Darren', 'pretty', 'little', 'boy', 'angelic', 'face', 'manipulative', 'slightly', 'twisted', 'personality', 'interviews', 'adult', 'Darren', 'apparent', 'Darren', 'leveraged', 'control', 'camera', 'means', 'instigating', 'series', 'intrigues', 'playmates', 'derived', 'sense', 'amusement', 'manipulation', 'extended', 'own', 'parents', 'whom', 'used', 'skits', 'out', 'gay', 'identity', 'them.Perhaps', 'Documentary', 'have', 'message', 'camera', 'form', 'manipulation', 'own', 'reality', 'may', 'be', 'source', 'corruption', 'culture', 'students', 'media', 'already', 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'outrageous', 'piece', 'personal', 'vanity', 'documentary', 'explain', 'us.Does', 'Stein', 'family', 'actually', 'believe', 'hodge-podge', 'home-made', 'videos', 'something', 'special', 'can', 'find', 'more', 'creative', 'stuff', 'YouTube', 'days', 'home', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'bunch', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'suburban', 'kids', 'documenting', 'sort', 'make', 'believe', 'kids', 'do', 'time', 'amuse', 'what', 'narcissistic', 'self', 'absorbed', 'Stein', 'family', 'NOT', 'high', 'art', 'even', 'unique', 'creative', 'only', 'unique', 'thing', 'Stein', 'father', 'was', 'wealthy', 'enough', 'provide', 'spoiled', 'youngsters', 'video', 'camera', 'back', '80', 'amateur', 'video', 'cameras', 'were', 'too', 'expensive', 'middle', 'class', 'families', 'afford.I', ""'d"", 'definately', 'advise', 'PASS', 'stupid', 'uninspiring', 'momument', 'rich', 'family', 'momument', 'own', 'narcissism']",Put the Camera on Me

It isn't that these people, who as children, had some weirdly creative lives, it's that a record of those times exist.  These kids cannot run and hide from who they were (and I'm not saying they would want to.) But it seems that some many people want to forget they were ever children because their adult lives are so much more important.This film is a window into the creative minds of children.  From the topics of their films, we learn what was on their minds, what their fears were and just how talented children can be.  The film is also a great tool for the study of group dynamics.Darren Stein: he's a creative genius along with being extremely smart for his age and very manipulative :)",5,It's psychological,1362182400,"03 2, 2013",2013,1007,"['film', 'films', 'are', 'remarkable', 'several', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'obvious', 'surface.While', 'have', 'decided', 'specifically', 'comment', 'pick', 'apart', 'specifics', 'childhood', 'movies', 'think', 'importance', 'fact', 'childhood', 'films', 'exist', 'have', 'been', 'shared', ""n't"", 'people', 'who', 'children', 'had', 'weirdly', 'creative', 'lives', 'record', 'times', 'exist', 'kids', 'can', 'not', 'run', 'hide', 'who', 'were', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'would', 'want', 'many', 'people', 'want', 'forget', 'were', 'ever', 'children', 'adult', 'lives', 'are', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'important.This', 'film', 'window', 'creative', 'minds', 'children', 'topics', 'films', 'learn', 'what', 'was', 'minds', 'what', 'fears', 'were', 'just', 'how', 'talented', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'tool', 'study', 'group', 'dynamics.Darren', 'Stein', 'creative', 'genius', 'being', 'extremely', 'smart', 'age', 'very', 'manipulative']",Put the Camera on Me
