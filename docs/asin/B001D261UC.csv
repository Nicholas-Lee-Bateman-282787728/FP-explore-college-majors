The cardio intervals are sometimes hard to follow because they change very quickly but this will improve with time and I was able to keep up for the most part.  The moves ranged from athletic moves like jumping jacks to traditional v steps and repeaters to samba dancy moves to mild kickboxing.  The hardest move was probably jumps 3 feet up in the air repeated 4 in a row at a time as part of a cardio burst.There are 3 exercisers including 1 who does the modifications the whole time.  This means for example she never uses weights.  The sculpting moves with weights start out slow and build on.  Of course being the firm there are a lot of lunges and squats.I felt the ab work was limited in this routine although a few exercises were included at the end.The instructor is very peppy and talks a lot but says comments like she is really encouraging you and feeling what you do.I liked this workout bottom line because you get a good workout in 30 minutes.
