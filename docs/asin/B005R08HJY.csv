The camerawork was great - cool angles, well framed shots, etc.; same for audio, atmospherics and even (mostly) acting.  Sadly however, the story was not good at all, and borders on incoherent.  As you watch this film, it feels like an exercise in who can be the most incentive member of the team, except the screenwriters, so you end up with an artificially, somewhat over the top film that lacks meaningful substance.  It reminds me of Guy Ritchie - IMHO Lock Stock and Snatch are brilliant stories and very creative camerawork and editing, but his later movies had everything the same minus the stories.  So it is here.  Its an ok watch if you're bored, just don't expect the story to have any meaningful impact.",2,"Creative editing, but weak plot",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,800,"['movie', 'category', 'everything', 'being', 'good', 'story', 'sadly', 'camerawork', 'was', 'great', 'cool', 'angles', 'well', 'framed', 'shots', 'etc', 'same', 'audio', 'atmospherics', 'even', 'mostly', 'acting', 'Sadly', 'however', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'good', 'borders', 'incoherent', 'watch', 'film', 'exercise', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'most', 'incentive', 'member', 'team', 'screenwriters', 'end', 'up', 'artificially', 'somewhat', 'top', 'film', 'meaningful', 'substance', 'Guy', 'Ritchie', 'IMHO', 'Lock', 'Stock', 'Snatch', 'are', 'brilliant', 'stories', 'very', 'creative', 'camerawork', 'editing', 'later', 'movies', 'had', 'everything', 'same', 'stories', 'here', 'ok', 'watch', ""'re"", 'bored', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'story', 'have', 'meaningful', 'impact']",N/A
1497850,ADFLPF6FI3W0O,B005R08HJY,ASP,"[0, 0]","This is a review for the DVD version of Catch .44.  The film is average at best.  Rating: 2.5 out of 5 stars.The audio is English Dolby Digital 5.1.  The SETUP allows you to choose AUDIO COMMENTARY with the director and editor.  The SUBTITLES options are ENGLISH or SPANISH.  There are no SPECIAL FEATURES.Bruce Willis has a total screen time of about 7 minutes, Forest Whitaker about 25 minutes, and Malin Akerman about 75 of the 90 minutes.  The Bruce Willis character isn't interesting, but Bruce does a decent job with his performance.  Forest Whitaker gives an interesting performance playing different personalities, but the characters are not intriguing or interesting.  Malin Akerman plays a tougher character, but her character isn't someone worth caring about.  This film felt more like a fun exercise for these actors. None of the performances are memorable, and neither is the film. The film starts to get somewhat interesting about halfway through.  Too many boring or slow scenes. The story is simple, but quite average, scoring a rating of 2.5 out of 5.As for the cinematography, the camera work is also average with a few decent and great frames, but most of the film's composition is just plain.  A lot of dark and yellow tinted scenes. The film's look is grainy at times, and it does help the atmosphere of the film.  As for the music, the particular rock music chosen just doesn't fit with most of the scenes.  It sounds okay for two or three, but it really doesn't help the film at all.If you are a Forest Whitaker fan and want to see his abilities, rent this. You won't be missing anything otherwise.",3,Average film.

1497851,A3CA3RWZYJDWXE,B005R08HJY,BJ Fraser,"[2, 4]","It's pretty obvious during the five minute conversation between the wanna-be Charlie's Angels (Tes, Kyla, and Dawn) that this movie desperately wants to be a Quentin Tarantino film.  Which was bad news for me because I don't really like Tarantino's films.  ""Reservoir Dogs"" is pretty good.  That's what this seems to aspire to, though it doesn't quite make it.This is the kind of movie where a lot of it is told in flashback, but I'll give it to you in chronological order, without trying to spoil too many surprises.  As I said at the outset there are three young women Tes, Kyla, and Dawn.  The latter two we can forget about because they die in the first ten minutes of the movie.  Tes (Malin Ackerman) is a former strip club waitress/pickpocket who works for crime boss Mel (Bruce Willis) around the New Orleans area.  She and her crew are assigned to go to a diner in the middle of nowhere to intercept a drug shipment (or something).  The drugs/cash are the film's MacGuffin, the thing everyone is fighting over and yet they don't really matter.But as we see early on things go wrong and Tes's underlings are killed.  There's a double-cross and then another double-cross and then another double-cross.  It'd take too long and spoil too much to say who all is double-crossing who.Anyway, like the earlier ""Smokin' Aces"" this is a film by a Tarantino disciple that tries to mimic the master's work, but never quite gets there.  It's got a lot of the same pieces, but feels too derivative.  (Which is maybe why I never heard of it before it showed up on the Vine newsletter and was released on DVD.)  If you're a fan of double-crosses and gore then this is a good rental, but I wouldn't buy it.BTW, like the earlier ""13"" I got from Vine the DVD includes no extras.  I don't know if the actual sale version does or not.

They can be done backwards, they can be done out of order or they just didn't have to be so straight forward. In all three of those movies, the way the story was told added to the movie. They were unique and challenging. CATCH .44 appears to be doing the same thing, but for different reasons. CATCH .44 is doing it because they wanted to.There is no reason to tell this movie out of order. Personally, I find it hard to believe and painful to watch as three people in a restaurant hold guns on each other, sweating with intensity, scared that the other is going to open fire, but telling each other stories as to how they each arrived at their locations. For ten minutes, guns are trained, stories are being told. I wanted somebody to just pull the trigger, right in the middle of those stories and then turn the guns on themselves.CATCH .44 is a jumbled hodge podge of who really cares stories as to who is loyal to who and who made deals with who and they all would have faired better had we just seen the whole thing played out in real time, instead of seeing the bloody aftermath in the beginning and then again with a little bit more revealed, and then again with even more revealed and so on.It's a bad movie, and there's a reason why a movie that learned it's technique from gems like Pulp & Memento, and has Forrest Whitaker and Bruce Willis, went straight to video.

Anyway just so you know those in the kind movies I enjoyed plus many more I think it's good when you have a review from a person to know some other movies are they like.This movie is okay it's not great. At moments it has a pulp fiction type feel to it but sometimes the dialogue just seems like it's forced. It seems like their conversations are meant to seem like they have a lot more feeling than they actually do I went into this movie not knowing what to expect at never heard of it. But seeing stars that I recognized on the cover was very interesting seeing silk specter, Butch and Morgan Freeman had me interested in this movie (those names right there were just jokes I hope you enjoyed I lol'd) and I wasn't totally happy with the results.I mean it's not a totally bad movie there are a few good quotes that if you read other reviews you will see that stand out as interesting and insightful. But nothing that really makes this a must watch film. So should you watch it? And what makes it worth the watch? Those are really the ultimate questions when you do a movie review. I mean if you're somebody who always must see a movie that an actor is in that you like like Bruce Willis or Morgan Freeman (I'm just kidding I know is Forest Whitaker) then yes this movie will be fine. I think this movie may may be more of a rent or watch on demand when available.One thing that I found rather humorous in this movie is that there are many gunfights and in this movie they seem to have an overwhelming desire to not shoot a person wants or twice but to empty entire clips into them. And they spew cons of blood and gore all over the sets. I mean seriously one or 2 bullets is usually enough to kill any more than that now you're just being ridiculous.Oh and on one final note this movie is told in blocks a.k.a. the scenes are told in chronological order and there are flashbacks a.k.a. like pulp fiction kind of. So if you're a fan of that it's kind of interesting if you're not you might not enjoy that.Yeah so there you go I hope you enjoy this review I hope you found it funny also.

1497859,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B005R08HJY,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","With knowledge of Tarantino films, Kill Bill, Reservoir Dogs, Grindhouse, and Pulp Fiction, this is not a very good film. With absolutely no Tarantino context, this movie is not bad, but really gory.Catch .44 is a strange movie. On the one hand there are glaring Tarantino homage's (I'm being kind, some might call them straight up rip offs), the music, the stilted dialog, the freeze frame big red names, the pacing, and the gore. But Tarantino's films are themselves homage's to 60's and 70's grindhouse B movies and film noir. Tarantino couldn't have ever made his films if it wasn't for Sam Peckinpah. So is this film really that wrong? It's sort of a copy of a copy, and is that an awful thing?On the other hand, the film does some interesting time line manipulation, overall it is well made, it has a certain style, and there are some interesting twists and turns.If I'd never seen those films by Tarantino, I would have bought into this movie. This is the second film Aaron Harvey has directed, and he did a decent job. The first three quarters of the film has a catchy style, Harvey rewinds the timeline four times - moving the plot forward each time. He blends flashback into the story line reasonably well. The rhythm of the film falls apart in the last quarter (mostly when Bruce Willis arrives as a full character, ah yes the bathrobe Speedo scene was the moment), and marches to a more standard melodramatic resolution. The action builds appropriately, the horror of the moment is a surprise (I just knew Forest Whitaker was going to slam that hood on the cops head) and the gore is appropriately repulsive.If you have seen the Tarantino films, you will very likely dislike this film. The DVD cover marketing says, Reservoir Dogs meets The Usual Suspects. Well, yes it kind of does. Yes there is a scene in this film that is very much like Reservoir Dogs, but has nowhere near the power in this film (Harvey holds the scene too long). And I guess in a roundabout way, the Bruce Willis character Mel, could be a little like Keyser S&ouml;ze, and the premise a little similar. But, no way, Catch .44 is nowhere near as good as either film. I saw a lot of Kill Bill in this film. Out of nowhere Harvey uses some of the graphics from Pulp Fiction and Grindhouse. So a lot of people will see this film as a rip off of Tarantino.The three women in this film are gorgeous. Malin Akerman has the most incredible steel blue eyes - Harvey captures them beautifully in this film. Nikki Reed (Twilight series) is a tough slacker but has good chemistry with the other two actresses. The conversation in the diner is classic, she turns that around beautifully. Reila Aphrodite is the quiet third part of the team. Bruce Willis is appropriately disgusting in this film. I had a lot of trouble with his character - it didn't fit within the story line very well. Listening to Kevin Smith talk about directing Bruce Willis (you don't tell him what to do, he tells you what he's going to do), I have a feeling Bruce decided what he was going to do and say, and Harvey had to live with it. Bruce is an excellent actor and a funny man, but it seems like stardom has just gotten too big for him. Forest Whitaker is finally the unlikeable guy I've always wanted him to be. He was insane in this film.The film is a hard R rating. There is a ton of killing and gore, and strong language. There is the odd random bit of nudity in the background at a strip club, but nothing explicit. Younger viewers should really stay away.At just over an hour thirty minutes, the film is about the right length. The film was shot with Red cameras. Some of the handheld camera work was awful with that ""random"" shaky camera look. But mostly the camera work was solid, with good framing, and perfect focus.I'm torn by this film. On the one hand, for Aaron Harvey's second film, it's not a bad film and does pay homage to the 60's and 70's B picture. On the other hand, he has copied a lot of Tarantino's work. Overall, it's not a horrible film.Kill Bill - Volume OneKill Bill - Volume TwoPulp Fiction [Blu-ray]The Usual Suspects (Special Edition)Kevin Smith: Too Fat For 40(Kevin Smith talks about directing Bruce Willis in Red State)Reservoir Dogs (Two-Disc Special Edition)Grindhouse (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]",4,Homage to Tarantino,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,4296,"['knowledge', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Grindhouse', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'absolutely', 'Tarantino', 'context', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'really', 'gory.Catch', '.44', 'strange', 'movie', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'glaring', 'Tarantino', 'homage', ""'m"", 'being', 'kind', 'might', 'call', 'straight', 'up', 'rip', 'offs', 'music', 'stilted', 'dialog', 'freeze', 'frame', 'big', 'red', 'names', 'pacing', 'gore', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'are', 'homage', '60', '70', 'grindhouse', 'B', 'movies', 'film', 'noir', 'Tarantino', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'ever', 'made', 'films', 'was', ""n't"", 'Sam', 'Peckinpah', 'So', 'film', 'really', 'wrong', 'sort', 'copy', 'copy', 'awful', 'thing', 'other', 'hand', 'film', 'interesting', 'time', 'line', 'manipulation', 'overall', 'well', 'made', 'certain', 'style', 'are', 'interesting', 'twists', 'turns.If', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'films', 'Tarantino', 'would', 'have', 'bought', 'movie', 'second', 'film', 'Aaron', 'Harvey', 'directed', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'first', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'catchy', 'style', 'Harvey', 'timeline', 'four', 'times', 'moving', 'plot', 'forward', 'time', 'flashback', 'story', 'line', 'reasonably', 'well', 'rhythm', 'film', 'apart', 'last', 'quarter', 'mostly', 'when', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'full', 'character', 'ah', 'yes', 'bathrobe', 'Speedo', 'scene', 'was', 'moment', 'marches', 'more', 'standard', 'melodramatic', 'resolution', 'action', 'appropriately', 'horror', 'moment', 'surprise', 'just', 'knew', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'was', 'going', 'slam', 'hood', 'cops', 'head', 'gore', 'appropriately', 'repulsive.If', 'have', 'seen', 'Tarantino', 'films', 'will', 'very', 'likely', 'dislike', 'film', 'DVD', 'cover', 'marketing', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Well', 'kind', 'Yes', 'scene', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'nowhere', 'power', 'film', 'Harvey', 'scene', 'too', 'long', 'guess', 'roundabout', 'way', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'Mel', 'could', 'be', 'little', 'Keyser', 'S', 'ouml', 'premise', 'little', 'similar', 'way', 'Catch', '.44', 'nowhere', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'film', 'saw', 'lot', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'film', 'nowhere', 'Harvey', 'graphics', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Grindhouse', 'lot', 'people', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'rip', 'Tarantino.The', 'three', 'women', 'film', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'Malin', 'Akerman', 'most', 'incredible', 'steel', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Harvey', 'beautifully', 'film', 'Nikki', 'Reed', 'Twilight', 'series', 'tough', 'slacker', 'good', 'chemistry', 'other', 'two', 'actresses', 'conversation', 'diner', 'classic', 'beautifully', 'Reila', 'Aphrodite', 'quiet', 'third', 'part', 'team', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'appropriately', 'disgusting', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'trouble', 'character', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'story', 'line', 'very', 'well', 'Listening', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'talk', 'directing', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'do', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'do', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'have', 'feeling', 'Bruce', 'decided', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'do', 'say', 'Harvey', 'had', 'live', 'Bruce', 'excellent', 'actor', 'funny', 'man', 'like', 'stardom', 'just', 'gotten', 'too', 'big', 'Forest', 'Whitaker', 'finally', 'unlikeable', 'guy', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'be', 'was', 'insane', 'film.The', 'film', 'hard', 'R', 'rating', 'ton', 'killing', 'gore', 'strong', 'language', 'odd', 'random', 'bit', 'nudity', 'background', 'strip', 'club', 'nothing', 'explicit', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'should', 'really', 'stay', 'away.At', 'just', 'hour', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'film', 'right', 'length', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Red', 'cameras', 'handheld', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'awful', 'random', 'shaky', 'camera', 'look', 'mostly', 'camera', 'work', 'was', 'solid', 'good', 'framing', 'perfect', 'focus.I', ""'m"", 'torn', 'film', 'one', 'hand', 'Aaron', 'Harvey', 'second', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'pay', 'homage', '60', '70', 'B', 'picture', 'other', 'hand', 'copied', 'lot', 'Tarantino', 'work', 'Overall', 'not', 'horrible', 'film.Kill', 'Bill', 'Volume', 'OneKill', 'Bill', 'Volume', 'TwoPulp', 'Fiction', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Too', 'Fat', '40', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'talks', 'directing', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Red', 'State', 'Reservoir', 'Dogs', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Grindhouse', 'Two-Disc', 'Collector', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']']",N/A

1497863,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B005R08HJY,E. David Swan,"[3, 5]","Red flags started going off the moment I saw the movie box. First of all the title is too clever for its own good and really exists entirely BECAUSE someone thought it was clever. It has actors who've appeared in great movies but these same actors have appeared in terrible movies *cough* Battlefield Earth. It also uses the desperate, ""In the Tradition of..."" on the back of the box referencing several movies that Catch .44 is nothing like. The movie has one thing going for it, Forest Whitaker. I could watch Forest Whitaker knit a quilt and probably enjoy it. Unfortunately Forest talks with this bizarre Scarface accent that sounds increasingly silly as the movie progresses. The back of the box also advertises that it ""co-stars"" Academy Award nominee Brad Dourif who appears for about 2 minutes in a scene completely divorced from the rest of the movie.The plot of the movie is pretty much irrelevant and the movie gives away the ending in the first 10 seconds. It's all just a vehicle for shooting and f-bomb dropping and the pivotal scene where Whitaker, Malin Akerman (Watchmen) and some other dude find themselves in a three way Mexican standoff with guns pointed at each other. This scene goes on FOREVER. I swear it's like 30 minutes of `drop your gun', `no YOU drop your gun', `no you drop YOUR gun'. There is rambling about money and drugs and setups but it's all so dull and tedious.If I were not obligated to review this movie I would have quit early on. At the 20 minute mark I could not believe that it had only been 20 minutes. The movie is padded within an inch of its life and the dialogue is insufferable. With lines like, ""I'd say you got some BALLS, woman."" I often felt embarrassed for the veteran actors reading these lines. There is a lengthy scene at the end of the movie with Bruce Willis (looking very old) and Forest Whitaker (continuing to channel Scarface) that is PAINFUL to watch.This movie is not a realization of anyone's vision. It's made strictly to part fans of mindless violence and gratuitous profanity from their money. There is a scene where Whitaker is in a cop car and hears a thump from the trunk. He opens the trunk and shoots a guy several times. Who is this guy? He can't be the cop because that guy got shot in the head. That's about as gratuitous as violence can get. Although with the utterly pointless scene with Dourif I have to wonder if this movie was dramatically cut down in which case I applaud the produces for sparing the viewers additional torture but it makes for an incoherent mess. Catch .44 reeks of desperation and has all the hallmarks of a straight to DVD movie. The last two straight to DVD movies I reviewed actually surprised me being better than anticipated but this one just exists for no good reason.

It makes us wonder how tough it is for actors of the caliber of Forest Whitaker and Bruce Willis to turn up  some worthwhile material that takes advantage of their skills instead of these blood bath bores they seem to be accepting as scripts.

1497877,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005R08HJY,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","I had heard and read so many scathingly critical comments flung at writer/director Aaron Harvey's ""Catch .44"" that I was convinced it must surely be a disaster of epic proportion. I'm not sure what anyone else anticipates when sitting down to a straight-to-DVD endeavor, but my expectations tend to run fairly low. Thus, I was actually pleasantly surprised by this film. I found it quite entertaining in its own right with a number of noteworthy performances. Harvey shows a deft hand when handling dialogue and that ends up being a saving grace to the movie. My fundamental issue with the production has little to do with entertainment value and almost everything to do with originality. Like so many young filmmakers, Harvey clearly aspires to be the next Tarantino (and why not?), but ""Catch .44"" is so derivative that it begs to be judged in an unfavorable light. Even the DVD packaging references the sublime ""Reservoir Dogs."" I could forgive the similarities in structure and theme such as the chronologically scrambled narrative, overlapping timelines, the eclectic assortment of outlaws, and the clever/cool conversations that have little to do with the plot. But from moment to moment, every sequence in the film seems to have been lifted from another movie and cobbled together. Seriously. For every individual scene, I could name a comparable scene that served the same purpose from an earlier and similar movie.Taking that out of the equation for a moment, I actually thought the film was successful enough. Despite the presence of Bruce Willis in a minor role (though you'd never guess that from his huge head on the DVD cover), the actual lead of ""Catch. 44"" is up-and-comer Malin Akerman. Akerman plays a former strip club hostess and pickpocket who was drafted into a larger criminal enterprise by Willis. She and two gal pals (including True Blood's Deborah Ann Woll) have a late night assignment at a rural diner where the score looks to be a load of drugs and cash. But, as you might guess, things don't go exactly to plan and the story shifts into flashbacks to see how we arrived at this point. Forest Whitaker and his numerous accents are on hand, as well, as an enigmatic and dangerous stranger. Before the night is over, the diner will host a series of confrontations and it remains to be seen if anyone will be left unscathed. It's all fun and amusing with appropriate twists and turns, I just felt like I'd seen it all before.The cast is actually quite good. In general, I really like Akerman who is known largely for her comedic work (various romantic comedies, TV's The Comeback, the fantastic Childrens Hospital, Funny or Die Presents...) as well as her sultry turn in ""Watchmen."" Here, she displays a toughness that is unexpected and believable. Never heard of her? She's got some high-profile pictures in the offing including the adaptation of Broadways ""Rock of Ages"" and the biopic of porn star Linda Lovelace in which she is the lead. Whitaker seems to be having a good time as the unstable powder keg who somehow fits into the plot puzzle. Looking for Willis, though? He's got a couple of scenes and is amusing enough as the standard crime boss oddball. The girls actually listen to a Bruce Willis song from the eighties and mention the actor by name, but the gag ends up being a bit too jokey for my taste. Clearly Harvey has an ear and can write, he just needs to develop his own voice. But for now, ""Catch .44"" ends up being another in a long line of Tarantino wannabes, although a reasonably entertaining one.

We need to be honest: The 99% Fail Rate for plagiarism is something that needs to be beat into this new generation of filmmakers, actors and producers. S-T-O-P. If we don't, we'll keep seeing this kind of dung being pooped out forever because they're not receiving honest critique. False compliments and unconditional love from family members is not an appropriate formula for film productions and cinephiles.The unseemly addiction to Tarantino is sad and looks to yet infest another generation. The first step in rehab is admitting you have a problem.But I give '.44' credit - this one has Bruce Willis in it. But ol' Bruce has been doing quite a number of pure money gigs the past couple of years. He's done a bunch of throwaway performances that I believe are setting up his retirement fund; a fruit orchard in the French countryside with his visiting grandkids.I digress.This film lacks any emotional content or context; one of those productions where every single character is intentionally worthless and unredeemable. There's no connection to be made when everyone is a pure unadulterated scumbag. In fact, the flick's would-be heroine is a slimy fast talking manipulator whose ability to steal is matched only by her apparent skill in smuggling cocaine. Again, that's the lead character. Yay?The only interesting character of note, and he's no peach, is Forest Whitaker's mentally unstable hitman. But despite the amazing skill he showcases as an actor - it's not unique. We've all seen Forest 'do' crazy and off-kilter before. It's old hat for the artist and nothing that I would call attention to unless the film itself sucked.And this film sucked.Additionally, it would be an understatement to say that the script reads like a rip-off of every Tarantino-esque script, sans the cleverness or edged timing. One will never achieve success if all you do is ""homage"" other creators.I suspect Writer/Director Aaron Harvey wanted this, in part, to be a female empowerment flick.

It is supposed to be some sort of heist where three girlfriends team up to be gun wielding tough girls handling transaction of the drug money.  There are reference to Bruce Willis (who happens to play a role in this movie) and his movies form the 80s.  I guess it is supposed to be a nostalgic backdrop to the fact that three leading female actresses were probably born in 80s when Bruce Willis was making it big in the action movies.There is a lot of story telling and joke telling in this movie.  It is a futile attempt to get action moving from one point to another.  Bruce Willis' performance is his typical role: self-centered bad guy with plenty of female companions that are in his company for one purpose only (I will let you guess which one).  It is Forest Whitaker that give an amazing performance in this movie.

Kara,and others in this tight little mix-it-up filmed in Louisiana.The film certainly betrays its low budget roots(most of the action takes place in side somewhere;a definite sign),but the production staff ends up pulling off what I think is a decent enough thriller/drama within the confines of its restrictions.The story involves the boss Bruce Willis and his right hand man Forest Whitaker.Malin is a waitress in a dump of a strip club Willis runs,and Whitaker has a crush on her.She had been angling for a chance to meet the head man and finally gets it.After the meeting Willis hires her to do jobs for him.Malin hires two other girls,Woll and Reed,as her assistants.They mess up one job and move on to an interception of some drug money at a remote diner.They sit in the diner and the rendezvous time comes and goes.At just after 3AM they get up and hold at gunpoint all the patrons and demanding to know where the truck is.After the dust settles both of Malin`s associates are dead and she is in a Mexican standoff with the cook,who also happens to work for Willis.In walks Whitaker who has been prowling the town and its environs for the last few hours.He killed a cop and had been riding in his car.He also had pulled over Malin and her friends earlier,but she didn`t recognize him.It seems she only met Whitaker for about 15 minutes when he originally took her to see the boss many years before.Now Whitaker is telling Malin he loves her and wants her to shoot the cook.She balks once but finally gets up enough nerve to shoot.As she suddenly turns towards Whitaker(we saw that coming a mile away!),the camera pulls outside.Later,Willis finally arrives and finds the diner littered with bodies.He sits down in a booth,loaded gun on the table,across from Whitaker,who is bleeding from his left ear area.The movie up to this point had been plot jumping;reach one stage,jump back to explain events up to that point,go ahead a bit more and jump back to explain that,and so on.Well,this is the place where the movie initially came in.Willis tells Whitaker a parable about Running Bear,then after all is said and done,he shoots him dead.Before he leaves he puts the song of Running Bear(Johnny Preston)on the jukebox.As Willis is about to exit he hears the click of a trigger and looks around.Malin is still alive,and she shoots him.The camera leaps outside to Willis` chauffeur who hears two shots ring out.As he gets out of the car,gun in hand,Malin is there to disarm him and off she rides with the drug money on the seat beside her.Willis plays his part well,as does Whitaker,who plays a psychotic,with multiple personalities beautifully.Everyone else does a good job also on the acting front.The film itself is done well,but there is just nothing here to suggest the wow factor.It goes along at a good clip,is executed nicely,but I just couldn`t see anything else in it that would make me give it any more marks than I did.Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.The only extras are the trailer and some commentary.All in all a decent enough thriller that is raised to a better level thanks to the performances of its main stars Willis and Whitaker.The rest of the cast does fine work also,but it isn`t enough to get this film any higher than 3 stars.",3,A decent low budget pot boiler,1355529600,"12 15,

However, it doesn't work out as planned, to say the least. The movie is shot in a very similar way to Reservoir Dogs, with the present chaos taking place amidst a series of flashbacks leading up to it. It's clear that the writer and director Aaron Harvey took a very large cue from Quentin Tarantino, from the aforementioned shooting style to the stories and jokes that the characters tell, to the way the characters are introduced (actually a little more like Guy Ritchie, with freezing the shot to spell the characters' names). Unfortunately the movie is not as entertaining as the films that either of those directors tend to make. The dialogue, while it tries to be clever, tends to fall flat and isn't as funny as it's trying to be. It's an admirable effort, but isn't convincing and the opening diner dialogue in particular not only doesn't really make much sense, but is not helped by the terrible acting in it. The acting is better elsewhere in the film, but not so much here. The cast is good and it's a shame that it's spoiled on fairly lackluster material. Forest Whitaker in particular is pretty good, mainly because he changes accents pretty much every scene and keeps throwing you off guard. Since the movie only takes place in like 4-5 different places, the production costs were probably pretty low, though the violence is well done if that's what you're hoping for. The music is one of the best parts, and is used primarily as source cues such that the music is supposed to be playing in the scene itself, not just overlaid over everything else. All in all the movie is entertaining, but fairly predictable because we kind of start to expect as the movie goes on that not everybody will be making it out alive.

Evident by this film, which barely was given a theatrical release last winter and is now out on DVD and blu-ray to sucker unsuspecting poor souls who are going to say, well it's got Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker in it, how bad can it be. Trust me, it can be bad, it can be real bad.One of the executive producers is David Willis, can you guess who's brother this is. I suspect that David got on board this picture, and brother Bruce did him a solid by appearing in it, thus not only giving the movie credibility which it did not deserve, but also attracting other name actors. It should be noted though, that Willis is not the film's star despite what the marketing tries to convince you of, in fact, he has a rather small role. At least it can be said, he has the movie's best role, which still falls short of memorable.Filled with lots of lackluster dialogue used in long uninteresting speeches, filtered with endless profanities, used by lowlife characters. This picture knows what it wants, to be a Tarantino film, just doesn't have the slightest  idea of how to achieve it. The movie begins in a diner, is filled with flashbacks, has grindhouse style cuts and fade-outs, and even goes for a cool/hip ironic post modern sense of humor, evident in a scene where characters listen to a old cassette tape of Bruce Willis music from the 80's, ho ho. Filled to the gills with unresolved loose ends and dead ends.

The movie starts at the end and is told through flashbacks, so viewers know this scheme is not going to go well.There is nothing wrong with this Pulp Fiction-esque storytelling and plotting, except well, Catch .44 is fairly obviously trying to do what Pulp Fiction did.

I'm not sure why Bruce Willis would have signed on for this (much less why he is on the cover--his role is quite limited), much less Forrest Whittaker.  I guess the script must have looked like it had some promise.  Ultimately, this film is very dark, takes a while to get going, and then substitutes painful amounts of violence and some ""edgy"" time cutting for an actual plot.  Unfortunately, the ""cut back and forth"" thing has been done a lot, and doing it originally or in your own voice is harder and harder to do.  Here, it seems to echo a lot of the action films told in similar ways.  Some folks have referenced Tarantino, and I think that that is a pretty good reference.  Tarantino's insistence on comic book violence also comes through here.  Anyway, on the bright side, Ackerman is actually effective as an action heroine, and I just wish she had more to work with.  I'll recap the plot, but it is kind of beside the point--Ackerman and co need to wrangle a truck away from its driver at an out of the way diner.  The truck is supposed to be filled with goodies (drugs/money).  A simple plan, but we all know that simple plans never go according to plan.

The appearances of Bruce Willis and Forest Whittaker are little more than cameo appearances, especially Willis.  Their roles are as mysterious and meaningless as the three women's parts are.  It is quite obvious both Willis and Whittaker were simply involved to pick up some easy money with no real acting involvement.  Willis has done a few lousy movies like this lately, and I'm astounded he isn't worried about damaging his brand as an actor with tripe like this.Do not waste your time or money watching this film.

The movie really isn't that clever, but pretends to be. I was confused by the beginning. The film opens with Bruce Willis (Mel) talking to an unseen person who he has worked with for seven years but doesn't trust...cue credits. The music is Mexican-Cowboy grindhouse stuff during the credits. We see Tes driving...Then we see three women in a diner, they are talking about living in a man's world , the apparent theme of the film, when they attempt to rob the place and one of them gets shot...more credits and the music is ""Fox on the Run."" We have ventured into some kind of ""Pulp Fiction"" diner scene flashback scenario. The names on the girls flash on the screen by their face, which has come to be the rule rather than the exception in modern action films.Tes, the leader of the group, works at an exotic dance bar. They work for a drug dealer named Mel. The whole diner scene we saw earlier is about a drug deal. While there are cell phones, Mel talks on a red rotary dial phone to Tes in a remote phone booth, apparently something that still exists in Louisiana.While the girls are driving to the restaurant, there is some subplot action that is going on that appears unrelated.The movie swaps back and forth between the restaurant shoot-out action and various flashbacks leading up to the scene. The film is supposed to be a Tarantino style grindhouse, but doesn't really work that well as the characters aren't that great. There is no clever grindhouse dialouge. The flashback scenes don't work that well. Forest Whitaker uses different accents during the movie which doesn't appear to be by design.

Tess (Akerman) and her friends have one simple task. Meet a trucker at a restaurant and take the truck from him. Things do not go as planned and secrets begin to come out, as well as bullets. This movie was a surprise. After watching ""Set-up"" with Bruce Willis (who was in it for about 5 minutes) I was skeptical. While he is not the main star in this one either this one actually is a pretty good movie. This movie reminded me a lot of ""Pulp Fiction"" in the way that it jumps back and forth all the time until you have every part of the story. Akerman and Whitaker do a great job in this and for someone like Malin Akerman to take a role in an action movie and pull it off as good as she does is also a surprise.

As to the rest of the film, like storytelling, characters or acting, Aaron Harvey's crime thriller needs much improvement, or at least some originality.The story is about three young women Tes (Malin Akerman), Kara (Nikki Reed) and Dawn (Deborah Ann Woll), sitting and chatting in a midnight diner. Apparently they are there for a ""job"" that is offered by someone named Mel, but their plans - whatever they are - go terribly wrong when someone gets shot.Except the last part of someone being shot, this sounds pretty familiar. Those who remember Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer in ""Pulp Fiction"" (who doesn't?) know what I'm trying to say. Using flashbacks (or flashforwards), ""Catch .44"" will show us how Tess and her cohorts ended up getting into big trouble. Forest Whitaker and Bruce Willis also appear, though Willis's role (second-billed) is rather an extended cameo.Like a puzzle, each piece of the fragmented storyline fits in the right place, but watching the process is not very interesting. What makes Tarantino's film a classic is missing here. The dialogue lacks wit and power. Characters are types and their motives do not convince. What happens to each character is predictable. What will Forest Whitaker's character do next? Who will get killed or survive?

Oddly enough, it comes out on DVD about 11 days after the theatrical release. I'm confused. This is another train wreck of a film, much like Trespass with Nick Cage and Nicole Kidman. Only this time we have Bruce Willis as a head con man, Forest Whitaker as another con artist/killer, and Malin Akerman whom i only know from 27 dresses. Two big name stars, one an Oscar winner, the other an action icon. This is Bruces second ""stinker"" straight to DVD (the first being Setup), and now Forest has jumped on board?!! Come on. This movie takes itself to seriously and can't decide whether it wants to be a dark comedy, drama, or crime action thriller. It succeeds at being none of the above. Just feels that the story was thrown together in 10 minutes, the script seems to be read line by line, and the plot is just plain stupid. Although it tries to be clever. I give up on most of the stars i grew up with. I love all of the ones i listed and can't figure out ""why"" their movies are being snuffed out. I really have nothing else to say about this film, so as not to spoil it. But it's just more gun play, drugs, sex, and cursing, thrown together for a quick flick. Believe me, most of the films on PSN, or Xbox 360 that say see it before it hits theaters. There is a reason for that. :) 88% of fans want to see it according to Rotten Tomatoes, that will be a LOT of disappointed folks.Btw:Bruces character ""Mel"" may remind you of the similar part he played in The Whole Nine Yards, but don't let this fool you.
