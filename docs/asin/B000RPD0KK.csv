Nonetheless, I am always ready to be entertained. But Melissa Gilbert's character in this movie was so dreadful I cringed every time she came on the scene.First, there is her awful French accent. It is annoying, distracting and completely unnecessary to the story. Second, there is her incessant self-pitying which makes her into one of the most unloveable romantic heroines I ever ever seen. Third, she is one-dimensional. And she is ugly to boot. It is simply not believable that the hunk would fall in love with this wreck.The best part of the movie is the relationship between the hunk and the daughter ""Pip"". Indeed, Liana Liberato delivers the best acting job in the movie as the lonely daughter of a mopish mother who finds a friendship with Brad Johnson's character. Their relationship is far more deep, believable and meaningful than the so-called romance between between the two adults.And don't even get me stated on the sappy subplot of Opelia helping the homeless.Btw, as of this date, Amazon's IMDb site does not show this movie is now on DVD.Blaine in Seattle",2,Dreadful Melissa Gilbert Character,1198972800,"12 30, 2007",2007,1166,"['am', 'not', 'particular', 'fan', 'romance', 'novels', 'general', 'Danielle', 'Steele', 'particular', 'Nonetheless', 'am', 'always', 'ready', 'be', 'entertained', 'Melissa', 'Gilbert', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'dreadful', 'cringed', 'time', 'came', 'scene.First', 'awful', 'French', 'accent', 'annoying', 'distracting', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'story', 'Second', 'incessant', 'self-pitying', 'one', 'most', 'unloveable', 'romantic', 'heroines', 'ever', 'ever', 'seen', 'Third', 'one-dimensional', 'ugly', 'boot', 'simply', 'not', 'believable', 'hunk', 'would', 'fall', 'love', 'wreck.The', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'relationship', 'hunk', 'daughter', 'Pip', 'Indeed', 'Liana', 'Liberato', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'movie', 'lonely', 'daughter', 'mopish', 'mother', 'who', 'friendship', 'Brad', 'Johnson', 'character', 'relationship', 'far', 'more', 'deep', 'believable', 'meaningful', 'so-called', 'romance', 'two', 'adults.And', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'get', 'stated', 'sappy', 'subplot', 'Opelia', 'helping', 'homeless.Btw', 'date', 'Amazon', 'IMDb', 'site', 'not', 'show', 'movie', 'now', 'DVD.Blaine', 'Seattle']",Danielle Steel's Safe Harbour

She is left to raise a daughter alone.On a remote beach in California, she meets an artist (played by Brad Johnson) who she first mistrusts and then grows to love. Through a series of events, love begins to bloom between the two of them.This movie was a disappointment to me. Although the idea of the movie is great, the movie almost seems to lack heart. The pace of the movie goes very slowly and there does not seem to be any rhyme nor reason to the plot. The chemistry between Gilbert and Johnson is sketchy at best and their love scenes, while an attempt at passion is tried to be created, seems to be forced and overblown.The best chemistry of the movie is actually between Liana Liberato, who plays Pip, Gilbert's daughter in the movie, and Brad Johnson. They have some of the finest scenes in the movie, drawing together.Also while Melissa Gilbert is a fine actress, her attempt at a French accent is second-rate and laughable.
