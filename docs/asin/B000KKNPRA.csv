It is unfortunate that most reviewers look at it from the rather limited perspectives of Judea-Christian ethics, the good vs. evil dichotomy and morality. I am hoping that the film was not made by the director and the producer to give the viewers a moral or religious message, and that the reviewers do not always watch films in search of messages.The film is simply explained by the Doctor who, I found to be, an incredible character and a terrific actor. ""We are living in an accidental world, as accidents ourselves, and things just happen."" (not a quotation, but what I perceived from the film,) whether you look at it from an existentialist perspective or as if it was a Beckett or a Pinter work.None of the characters, with the exception of the doctor, can laugh at themselves. They take life and their views of it and their values and beliefs as selfishly important as possible even if they are not concerned with good and evil. I found that Miyazaki films like Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are very educational in showing the viewer that good and evil are not absolutes and can be quite interchangeable.I enjoyed the cinematography, the characters, the events in my first viewing, without subtitles. The jokes hit me with the subtitles, and caused, not necessarily loud laughter, but smiles, grins and a mischievous feeling. Please do not be offended by the treatment that the cat or the former Danish concentration camp soldier gets.Looking at things from the perspective of the makers of the film will not necessarily make you a very happy person, but you sure will spend more of your life laughing (mostly at yourself).",5,A Black Comedy of Behavioral Psychology and Psychoanalysis,1242950400,"05 22, 2009",2009,1721,"['film', 'should', 'be', 'required', 'viewing', 'graduate', 'school', 'psychology', 'students', 'unfortunate', 'most', 'reviewers', 'look', 'rather', 'limited', 'perspectives', 'Judea-Christian', 'ethics', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'dichotomy', 'morality', 'am', 'hoping', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'director', 'producer', 'give', 'viewers', 'moral', 'religious', 'message', 'reviewers', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'watch', 'films', 'search', 'messages.The', 'film', 'simply', 'explained', 'Doctor', 'who', 'found', 'be', 'incredible', 'character', 'terrific', 'actor', 'are', 'living', 'accidental', 'world', 'accidents', 'things', 'just', 'happen', 'not', 'quotation', 'what', 'perceived', 'film', 'look', 'existentialist', 'perspective', 'was', 'Beckett', 'Pinter', 'work.None', 'characters', 'exception', 'doctor', 'can', 'laugh', 'take', 'life', 'views', 'values', 'beliefs', 'selfishly', 'important', 'possible', 'even', 'are', 'not', 'concerned', 'good', 'evil', 'found', 'Miyazaki', 'films', 'Spirited', 'Away', 'Howl', 'Moving', 'Castle', 'are', 'very', 'educational', 'showing', 'viewer', 'good', 'evil', 'are', 'not', 'absolutes', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'interchangeable.I', 'enjoyed', 'cinematography', 'characters', 'events', 'first', 'viewing', 'subtitles', 'jokes', 'hit', 'subtitles', 'caused', 'not', 'necessarily', 'loud', 'laughter', 'smiles', 'grins', 'mischievous', 'feeling', 'Please', 'do', 'not', 'be', 'offended', 'treatment', 'cat', 'former', 'Danish', 'concentration', 'camp', 'soldier', 'gets.Looking', 'things', 'perspective', 'makers', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'necessarily', 'make', 'very', 'happy', 'person', 'sure', 'will', 'spend', 'more', 'life', 'laughing', 'mostly']",N/A

1034846,ATYTXN352VQ8F,B000KKNPRA,chainlink,"[5, 6]","I got the impression from some of the reviews here that this was an extremely quirky, one-off, come-from-nowhere kind of film, but it turns out to be strikingly traditional. It signals this tradition self-consciously by referring (fleetingly) to Kaj Munk, a Danish playwright/pastor murdered at age 45 by the Nazis.Munk was the author of ""Ordet,"" (""The Word""), a play reworked into film by the Danish film God Carl Dreyer (""Vampyr,"" ""The Passion of Joan of Arc,"" ""The Day of Wrath""--he is covered in virtually all general film histories, and is a presence still in many a film class) in 1955. It may not be its director's most famous film, but once seen it is unforgettable, though it is also in a sense indigestible as well.""The Word"" tells of an extended family in a windswept rural Denmark, three brothers and a father, who, a bit like Dostoevsky's Karamazovs, represent different attitudes toward religious belief. Together with the new pastor (coolly professional), the family doctor (coldly unbelieving), and the town tailor (heatedly sectarian) this household presents a broad range of responses to the challenge of faith, of which the most radical is that of the brother Johannes. He had been at seminary, and like Don Quixote, was driven insane--as the family tells it--by too much reading, not of chivalric romances this time, but of Kierkegaard's philosophy. Kierkegaard was a fideist, claiming that faith owed nothing to rational judgment, but was simply a leap into the unknown.In his madness, Johannes thought he was Jesus, and out St. Francissed St. Francis himself, in a sense, by preaching not to birds but to wild grass. The climax of the story comes when a death threatens to dissolve the household, and Johannes, who seems finally to have hit bottom after his religious leap into the absolute void, repeats Jesus' most spectacular miracle, and raises the dead (I'm amazed what a risk Dreyer took in attempting such a scene, but he pulled it off: you can't really watch it with a smirk.) This direct experience of raw divinity, a kind of mini-apocalypse (since the apocalypse is the time when every believer imagines himself fully and demonstrably  justified in his faith vis-a-vis all non- and other-believers) reduces all of the old personal struggles and interpersonal disagreements over faith to utter meaninglessness.""Adam's Apples"" takes much from ""Ordet,"" though it reworks, modernizes, perhaps, the family at its center, which now consists of various criminals and life-losers at a halfway house run by an apparently mad pastor. Once again, this character is a religious Don Quixote; once again a religious crisis and a death threaten to dissolve altogether the fragile unity of the group; and once again a miracle restores it. This film takes less of risk with the miracle, sort of hides it under a certain jokiness, but the effect is, surprisingly, not all that different.Even some of us unbelievers can't suppress the suspicion that it is the faith of believers, mad though it seem, that somehow holds things together for all of us.",5,"A reconception of Carl Dreyer's ""Ordet""",1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2012,3062,"['got', 'impression', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'extremely', 'quirky', 'one-off', 'come-from-nowhere', 'kind', 'film', 'out', 'be', 'strikingly', 'traditional', 'tradition', 'self-consciously', 'referring', 'fleetingly', 'Kaj', 'Munk', 'Danish', 'playwright/pastor', 'murdered', 'age', '45', 'Nazis.Munk', 'was', 'author', 'Ordet', 'Word', 'play', 'reworked', 'film', 'Danish', 'film', 'God', 'Carl', 'Dreyer', 'Vampyr', 'Passion', 'Joan', 'Arc', 'Day', 'Wrath', 'covered', 'virtually', 'general', 'film', 'histories', 'presence', 'still', 'many', 'film', 'class', '1955', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'director', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'once', 'seen', 'unforgettable', 'also', 'sense', 'indigestible', 'as', 'well', 'Word', 'tells', 'extended', 'family', 'windswept', 'rural', 'Denmark', 'three', 'brothers', 'father', 'who', 'bit', 'Dostoevsky', 'Karamazovs', 'represent', 'different', 'attitudes', 'religious', 'belief', 'Together', 'new', 'pastor', 'coolly', 'professional', 'family', 'doctor', 'coldly', 'unbelieving', 'town', 'tailor', 'heatedly', 'sectarian', 'household', 'broad', 'range', 'responses', 'challenge', 'faith', 'most', 'radical', 'brother', 'Johannes', 'had', 'been', 'seminary', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'was', 'driven', 'insane', 'family', 'too', 'much', 'reading', 'not', 'chivalric', 'romances', 'time', 'Kierkegaard', 'philosophy', 'Kierkegaard', 'was', 'fideist', 'claiming', 'faith', 'owed', 'nothing', 'rational', 'judgment', 'was', 'simply', 'leap', 'unknown.In', 'madness', 'Johannes', 'thought', 'was', 'Jesus', 'St.', 'Francissed', 'St.', 'Francis', 'sense', 'preaching', 'not', 'birds', 'wild', 'grass', 'climax', 'story', 'when', 'death', 'dissolve', 'household', 'Johannes', 'who', 'finally', 'have', 'hit', 'bottom', 'religious', 'leap', 'absolute', 'void', 'Jesus', 'most', 'spectacular', 'miracle', 'dead', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'what', 'risk', 'Dreyer', 'took', 'attempting', 'scene', 'pulled', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'watch', 'smirk', 'direct', 'experience', 'raw', 'divinity', 'kind', 'mini-apocalypse', 'apocalypse', 'time', 'when', 'believer', 'fully', 'demonstrably', 'justified', 'faith', 'vis-a-vis', 'non-', 'other-believers', 'old', 'personal', 'struggles', 'interpersonal', 'disagreements', 'faith', 'utter', 'meaninglessness', 'Adam', 'Apples', 'much', 'Ordet', 'modernizes', 'perhaps', 'family', 'center', 'now', 'various', 'criminals', 'life-losers', 'halfway', 'house', 'run', 'apparently', 'mad', 'pastor', 'Once', 'again', 'character', 'religious', 'Don', 'Quixote', 'once', 'again', 'religious', 'crisis', 'death', 'threaten', 'dissolve', 'altogether', 'fragile', 'unity', 'group', 'once', 'again', 'miracle', 'film', 'less', 'risk', 'miracle', 'sort', 'hides', 'certain', 'jokiness', 'effect', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'unbelievers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'suppress', 'suspicion', 'faith', 'believers', 'mad', 'seem', 'somehow', 'things', 'together']",N/A

1034851,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000KKNPRA,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 1]","It is a simple but effective film. In spite of the fact that it is a rewriting of the Book of Job, the film conveys interesting questions. We totally have to forget about who is torturing the poor minister, God or Satan. That's not the question. The question is that his attitude is determined by what he believes. He believes he is being tortured by the devil and that is enough to justify the final miracle of the end of his cancer with a single gunshot. What is important is that, no matter what he believes, he follows a road of truthfulness and he brings comfort to extreme cases of a-social people. The apple tree then becomes a cross between the Book of Genesis in which the apple tree is the tree of knowledge and wisdom but absolutely out of reach due to one of God's ukases and that Book of Job I was citing before. The newcomer being called Adam the allusion is obvious. That tree is God's tree. Then all the attacks he suffers can only come from the snake, Satan, the devil. The point is that the plagues that tree suffers are quite reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt. That's where we meet with Job. God is not only planning the future ahead but he is also testing his servants by torturing them and the plagues come from God and the silly mortals around that tree have to make penance because they are punished by God and tested by God and they have to go away or keep their faith. And they just do so. Adam will make a small apple pie with the last scavenged apple of the tree and he will share that apple pie with the minister Ivan, a direct allusion that has to be designed so to Adam and Eve, or here Adam and Ivan. But after that episode they are not rejected by the parish, they can come back to their little piece of Christian paradise in a world of squalor, the two of them and yet they won't make many children but they will welcome the lost errant children of god. And guess what: they welcome two men together coming from some prison, Abel and Cain of course, and the world can go on turning.

1034853,AYCJSA9HR7TKO,B000KKNPRA,Kerry Walters,"[2, 4]","One of the things that the postmodern turn has given us permission to do is to read fresh perspectives into hallowed texts.  Take the Book of Job, for example.  For centuries, it's been viewed as a sober and solemn reflection on the mystery of innocent suffering.  That's certainly one legitimate reading.  But if you think about it from another perspective, the Book of Job is also incredibly funny.  Poor schleppy Job initially refuses to acknowledge that he's really suffered any harm, even when it's apparent he has, on the grounds that what was taken from him wasn't his to begin with.  When he finally comes round to the realization that he has indeed been screwed, his three Keystone Cop pals fall all over themselves to assure him that he really hasn't been because he deserved it all along.  It's a funny story--but at the same time, a story whose insight into the human condition touches one's heart.Anders Thomas Jensen's ""Adam's Apples,"" a deadpan comedy that serves up a 21st century Book of Job, is just as funny and just as heart-breaking.  Pastor Ivan (Mads Mikkelson) simply can't bring himself to doubt in God's goodness, despite the escalating Job-like tragedies that befall him:  his mother's death in birthing him, sexual abuse when he was a child, his wife's suicide, his child's handicap, Khalid's thievery, Paul's drunkenness, the likelihood that Sarah will give birth to a deformed child, and Adam's (Ulrich Thomson) violence and cruelty.  The undeniability of undeserved evil keeps piling up and Ivan keeps denying, going to such lengths to do so that, after awhile, the viewer can't help but laugh.  When reality finally does puncture Ivan's illusion, he's ""rescued"" from despair in an equally laughable (because so implausible) manner (more detail would give the game away for folks who haven't yet seen the film), and the film winds up with a deliberately artificial happy ending--the same sort of deadpan that concludes the ""real"" Book of Job.  And always in the background is the cynical and somewhat manipulative but not really evil God-figure--in the film's case, Dr. Kolberg.Despite the vaudevillian humor in ""Adam's Apples,"" the story of Ivan's constancy and Adam's transformation (not to mention Paul's, Sarah's, and Khalid's) gesture at great and touching truths.

1034857,AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B000KKNPRA,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[50, 51]","Adam, a convicted criminal and skinhead prone to violent rages, is sent to serve out the remainder of his jail sentence in community service at a small town church.  The pastor, who refuses to accept -- even in the face of the most plain evidence -- that anyone can possibly be evil, assigns to him a task that seems trivial, until it begins to appear that the very cosmos is conspiring against him.  The film explores the classic conflict between faith and reason and between good and evil in the most blunt way imaginable -- by pitting an obstinately naive believer against a stubbornly unrepentant and bitter neo-Nazi -- and completely avoids the pitfalls of predictability.Adam's Apples manages to be both hilarious and profound, as well as endlessly inventive.  Just when you think the stakes can't get any higher, something happens that is utterly unexpected and over the top and in hindsight completely in line with the plot as so far developed.  Then the filmmaker ratchets things up a bit more.  The mood, alternating between cheerful optimism and deep pessimism, is perfectly sustained by a rich musical score and by the lavish cinematography.  This is a finely crafted film.For those who are familiar with Danish film and especially with the Dogme 95 movement (in which Anders Thomas Jensen was a major contributor), the major actors will be familiar but are playing here gleefully against type.  Mads Mikkelsen (yes, the bad guy from Casino Royale) as the pastor; Ulrich Thompson as the overweight convict Nazi, Adam; Parika Steen as a pregnant alcoholic.  Every one of the characters is somehow both despicable and extremely likable.  This was my favorite film that played at Sundance in 2006, and I have been surprised that it didn't get more widely publicized -- since every audience I saw it with (twice at Sundance and again in Florida) was practically rolling in the aisles and raving afterwards.  My sense is that the religious theme, combined with a bit of pretty graphic violence and language, scared critics away and kept it from being widely released.  That's a shame since it is a very well-made and very funny movie, that raises intriguing questions anyone with an open mind, whether religious or not, should find important.

I knew absolutely nothing of the movie, the fact that it was a Film Movement release was good enough for me.""Adam's Apples"" (2005 release from Denmark) brings the story of Adam, who is just released from jail after being convicted of being a neo-Nazi, and who arrives in the countryside in Denmark, where he is to stay in a small religious community as part of his release deal. He is met by Ivan, the minister who runs the program. When Ivan asks Adam what his next goal is, Adam responds jokingly ""to make an apple pie"" (since there is a nice apple tree on the compound) and Ivan, with enthousiam, agrees and makes Adam the keeper of the apple tree. We soon learn that Ivan has had a horrible life yet remains upbeat, seemingly blocking out all negative aspects of life, much to the irritation of Adam, who becomes bent on convincing Ivan of the ""real life"". At that point we are only one-third into the movie, and I don't want to tell you more of the plot, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this is a very quirky little movie with a lot of serious undertones, in fact I thought of titling my review ""existential drama"" but that would probably be an overstatement, although not by much. But the theme of religious good versus evil plays an important role throughout.

While he's a prolific screenwriter, he doesn't often direct, and it took two years for his follow-up, Adam's Apples, to hit screens in Europe (and a lot longer to get here, as usual). Jensen once again partners with Green Butchers frontman Mads Mikkelsen in a meditation on spirituality, sanity, prejudice, and bucolic rural life that is far more serious, and yet no less funny, than his last.Adam (The World Is Not Enough's Ulrich Thomsen) is a skinhead who's just been released from prison into a work-release kind of deal. He's supposed to help out at a rural church run by Ivan (Mikkelsen), the local pastor. When Adam gets there, he finds that two other former prisoners, Gunnar (Dark Horse's Nicolas Bro) and Khalid (Rule No. 1's Ali Kazim), are still in attendance; he is told they completed their sentences, but elected to stay anyway. Ivan demands that Adam name a task he would like to work through during their time together. Tongue planted firmly in cheek, Adam replies he'd like to bake an apple pie. The pastor takes him at his word. From all this, you'd expect some sort of uplifting story of redemption to follow, but if you think you're going down that path, you don't know the work of Anders Thomas Jensen; as time goes on, the inhabitants of the church (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the town) turn out to be the weirdest bunch this side of a John Irving novel, and Adam ultimately ends up thinking he's the sanest one there. Things go along swimmingly, if oddly, until some of his old friends show up...One of the things that I really love about Jensen is his comic timing. Invariably, the movie's funniest scenes spring from its saddest; the madness of the main characters allows them to say inappropriate things and still be entirely in character, and it all works swimmingly. Jensen builds our emotions through letting us get to know these characters, rather than using the emotional shortcuts so common in Hollywood, and the comedy here is very much dependent on the tragedy; the film won't work if you can't empathize, or at least sympathize, with these characters. Jensen pulls it off.Jensen is virtually unknown in America, and given the amazing quality of these two films (this and The Green Butchers), that's a crime. Discover Anders Thomas Jensen.

While underlying all of this there is the beautiful story of God's love for everyone and how God gives us the power to overcome it was told in such a disgustingly perverted way it almost mocks God and the story it ultimately tells. There is symbolism everywhere. The Bible repeatedly being dropped and it always opening to the Book of Job. The apple tree being decimated . . . all but a few apples to make a delicious pie. Even so, this is not art. It is filth. Even the language used is graphic. The way the town doctor describes the man's molestation by his father is just disturbing.

I took a chance on this film not really knowing much about it, expect that is starred Mads Mikkelsen (he is an amazing actor) and that was enough for me.In my opinion he steals the whole movie. This movie is a great find and it really does make you think about good and evil, but in a totally unexpected way.One of the main characters, Ivan, only sees good in everything no matter how screwed up his life is and refuses to see it as anything but perfect becasue God loves him. The other main character,Adam, sees himself as the embodiment of evil and proclaims himself so and sets out to show Ivan that in fact God does not love him and that is why his life is as totally messed up as it is. What follows is the funniest jet black comedy, that keeps on getting blacker and funnier through out some crazy twists and turns.  Though do keep in mind this movie is not exactly what we Americans would term politically corret, and that is a very good thing indeed.A movie well worth the subtitles.",5,A Most Wonderful and Unexpected Find,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",2008,1053,"['Adams', 'Apples', 'blackest', 'comedy', 'have', 'seen', 'date', 'took', 'chance', 'film', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'much', 'expect', 'starred', 'Mads', 'Mikkelsen', 'amazing', 'actor', 'was', 'enough', 'me.In', 'opinion', 'whole', 'movie', 'movie', 'great', 'find', 'really', 'make', 'think', 'good', 'evil', 'totally', 'unexpected', 'way.One', 'main', 'characters', 'Ivan', 'only', 'good', 'everything', 'matter', 'how', 'screwed', 'up', 'life', 'see', 'anything', 'perfect', 'becasue', 'God', 'other', 'main', 'character', 'Adam', 'embodiment', 'evil', 'so', 'out', 'show', 'Ivan', 'fact', 'God', 'not', 'love', 'why', 'life', 'totally', 'messed', 'up', 'What', 'funniest', 'jet', 'black', 'comedy', 'getting', 'blacker', 'funnier', 'out', 'crazy', 'twists', 'turns', 'do', 'keep', 'mind', 'movie', 'not', 'exactly', 'what', 'Americans', 'would', 'term', 'politically', 'corret', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'indeed.A', 'movie', 'well', 'subtitles']",N/A

This movie was one of the earliest Danish films that I saw, but it was memorable because of how good it was. I own it and have seen it many times, because it's simply that good.The cast includes some of Denmark's most talented actors and is extremely well done, even for a Danish film (which says a *lot*, as the bar is quite high to begin with, in my opinion).What I like most about this movie is that you never quite know where it's going to go. At times you suspect that something is going to happen, or that the plot will veer in a particular direction, but more often than not you end up completely wrong. The surprising turns, coupled with a mixture of both humor and genuine drama, are what sets this film apart and makes it memorable.I definitely encourage anyone into Danish film to check this one out.
