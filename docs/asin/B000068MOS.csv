704955,A1WXV2M71VH7TH,B000068MOS,A woman,"[0, 0]","First of all, I think the best bellydance workout is ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"". It's so brilliantly organized that both total novices and advanced students can enjoy it.Dolphina's workout is exclusively for the advanced. Her focus is combining isolations with steps and turns. She also makes you isolate while gradually kneeling (both knees/a single knee). There are some easier moves here, like hip drops. But most of Dolphina's exercises are hard. To make it even harder to follow, this video has some flaws:- Some of the moves Dolphina doesn't break down well or doesn't break down at all.- She sometimes picks up speed too soon into an exercise.- A few times she forgets to reverse the direction or practice a move on the other side.- I wish some exercises were longer. I think it could have been done at the expense of the ""warm up"" and ""cool down"" - the sections that I find boring and needless, as this workout is difficult ONLY in terms of coordination, not in terms of strength or flexibility.- Dolphina's technique: her arm positions and movements are unpolished, as well as some of her chest movements. This is easy to ignore during the exercises, as they are mostly about hips, and her hipwork is beautiful. But it makes it impossible to enjoy her routine at the end. Actually many of her moves look awkward during that routine. Also, her demonstration of camels combined with steps is somewhat sloppy, and in one of those exercises she eventually loses her camels altogether.- Sometimes the camera zooms out ridiculously far. I guess the point was to show off the set, but the set only ended up looking more artificial. And Dolphina becomes really hard to see. (However, whenever the focus is back to normal, the background also gets nice: just slightly drifting clouds... neat and refreshing).- Although the music is adorable, it's very obscured by talking. Dolphina's voice was recorded at a much higher volume than the music. Moreover, some of that talking is totally needless, like counting or cheesy encouragements (""You are a goddess""; ""your hips are your weapon"").However, all those imperfections seem minor to me... I've seen *really* horribly constructed, absolutely unusable videos (e.g. ""Precision motion workout"" by Suzanna Del Vecchio; see also my 1-star reviews). Compared to them Dolphina's workout is a breath of fresh air. Her presence is actually wonderful. She is kind of playful (sometimes a bit silly, but it's part of her charm). The overall atmosphere is nice and keeps me coming back.",4,I like it despite all its flaws,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,2529,"['First', 'think', 'best', 'bellydance', 'workout', 'Learn', 'lavish', 'layers', 'Ansuya', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'organized', 'total', 'novices', 'advanced', 'students', 'can', 'enjoy', 'it.Dolphina', 'workout', 'exclusively', 'advanced', 'focus', 'combining', 'isolations', 'steps', 'turns', 'also', 'isolate', 'gradually', 'kneeling', 'knees/a', 'single', 'knee', 'are', 'easier', 'moves', 'here', 'hip', 'drops', 'most', 'Dolphina', 'exercises', 'are', 'hard', 'make', 'even', 'harder', 'follow', 'video', 'flaws', 'moves', 'Dolphina', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'well', ""n't"", 'break', 'down', 'all.-', 'sometimes', 'up', 'speed', 'too', 'soon', 'exercise.-', 'A', 'few', 'times', 'reverse', 'direction', 'practice', 'move', 'other', 'side.-', 'wish', 'exercises', 'were', 'longer', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'expense', 'warm', 'up', 'cool', 'down', 'sections', 'find', 'boring', 'needless', 'workout', 'difficult', 'ONLY', 'terms', 'coordination', 'not', 'terms', 'strength', 'flexibility.-', 'Dolphina', 'technique', 'arm', 'positions', 'movements', 'are', 'unpolished', 'as', 'well', 'chest', 'movements', 'easy', 'ignore', 'exercises', 'are', 'mostly', 'hips', 'hipwork', 'beautiful', 'impossible', 'enjoy', 'routine', 'end', 'Actually', 'many', 'moves', 'look', 'awkward', 'routine', 'Also', 'demonstration', 'camels', 'combined', 'steps', 'somewhat', 'sloppy', 'one', 'exercises', 'eventually', 'camels', 'altogether.-', 'Sometimes', 'camera', 'out', 'ridiculously', 'far', 'guess', 'point', 'was', 'show', 'off', 'set', 'set', 'only', 'ended', 'up', 'looking', 'more', 'artificial', 'Dolphina', 'really', 'hard', 'see', 'However', 'whenever', 'focus', 'back', 'normal', 'background', 'also', 'nice', 'just', 'slightly', 'drifting', 'clouds', 'neat', 'refreshing', '.-', 'music', 'adorable', 'very', 'obscured', 'talking', 'Dolphina', 'voice', 'was', 'recorded', 'much', 'higher', 'volume', 'music', 'Moreover', 'talking', 'totally', 'needless', 'counting', 'cheesy', 'encouragements', 'are', 'goddess', 'hips', 'are', 'weapon', '.However', 'imperfections', 'seem', 'minor', ""'ve"", 'seen', '*really*', 'horribly', 'constructed', 'absolutely', 'unusable', 'videos', 'e.g', 'Precision', 'motion', 'workout', 'Suzanna', 'Del', 'Vecchio', 'see', 'also', '1-star', 'reviews', 'Compared', 'Dolphina', 'workout', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'presence', 'actually', 'wonderful', 'kind', 'playful', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'silly', 'part', 'charm', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'nice', 'coming', 'back']",N/A
704956,A2VV4JWNKCQHF0,B000068MOS,Basbenee,"[10, 10]","I bought the first video Dolphina outputted, and while I did like it, I did have a few problems with the camera focusing on her midriff, not showing the moves well enough.Dolphina in this video has resolved a lot of issues that many online reviewers complained about. First of all, the camera does not linger on her torso or face extensively. In this video you pretty much get a full body shot throughout so you can see all she is doing.She's simplified things somewhat, too, wearing comfy pants and a tank top throughout most of the video, so you can more easily see her movements, until she changes into a costume for the dance routine at the end and for the cooldown. I'll admit I miss all the costumes from the first one; I thought they were beautiful to look at and they offered some great ideas for designing your own.I've got probably close to 20 bellydance workout videos at home, and whereas some of them gel together (same moves, different dancer, slightly different order) in this one Dolphina offers more variety.The workout focuses more on the lower body and it's a lot more challenging. The first time I worked out to it I really, really felt it in my abs (like doing situps but you're actually incorporating ab exercises into dance moves).Dolphina also shows you a lot of dance steps (""Mayas,"" ""camels,"" ""dolphins"" and so on) and layers moves to offer a more challenging workout.The first time I did the routine I could not mimic all the moves and even rewound some parts to better get a feel for the steps (she does, by the way, explain them very well, but they are more complicated, so if you're out of shape or out of practice you'll have more work in store for you), and I personally liked that. After doing this workout maybe three times a week (but still working out to other bellydance tapes in between), my pants feel a little bit looser and I'm definitely feeling stronger and more powerful, really like a warrior goddess.The dance routine toward the end is pretty involved, and you can get a better idea of Dolphina's dancing skills, too. It definitely a more difficult workout, and I'm very happy with this tape.",5,You'll feel like a Warrior Goddess,1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,2138,"['bought', 'first', 'video', 'Dolphina', 'outputted', 'did', 'did', 'have', 'few', 'problems', 'camera', 'focusing', 'midriff', 'not', 'showing', 'moves', 'well', 'enough.Dolphina', 'video', 'resolved', 'lot', 'issues', 'many', 'online', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'First', 'all', 'camera', 'not', 'linger', 'torso', 'face', 'extensively', 'video', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'full', 'body', 'shot', 'can', 'see', 'doing.She', 'simplified', 'things', 'somewhat', 'too', 'wearing', 'comfy', 'pants', 'tank', 'top', 'most', 'video', 'can', 'more', 'easily', 'see', 'movements', 'costume', 'dance', 'routine', 'end', 'cooldown', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'miss', 'costumes', 'first', 'one', 'thought', 'were', 'beautiful', 'look', 'offered', 'great', 'ideas', 'designing', 'own.I', ""'ve"", 'got', 'probably', 'close', '20', 'bellydance', 'workout', 'videos', 'home', 'whereas', 'gel', 'together', 'same', 'moves', 'different', 'dancer', 'slightly', 'different', 'order', 'one', 'Dolphina', 'more', 'variety.The', 'workout', 'more', 'lower', 'body', 'lot', 'more', 'challenging', 'first', 'time', 'worked', 'out', 'really', 'really', 'felt', 'abs', 'doing', 'situps', ""'re"", 'actually', 'incorporating', 'ab', 'exercises', 'dance', 'moves', '.Dolphina', 'also', 'lot', 'dance', 'steps', 'Mayas', 'camels', 'dolphins', 'so', 'moves', 'offer', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout.The', 'first', 'time', 'did', 'routine', 'could', 'not', 'mimic', 'moves', 'even', 'rewound', 'parts', 'better', 'get', 'feel', 'steps', 'way', 'explain', 'very', 'well', 'are', 'more', 'complicated', 'so', ""'re"", 'shape', 'practice', ""'ll"", 'have', 'more', 'work', 'store', 'personally', 'liked', 'doing', 'workout', 'maybe', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'still', 'working', 'out', 'other', 'bellydance', 'tapes', 'pants', 'feel', 'little', 'bit', 'looser', ""'m"", 'definitely', 'feeling', 'stronger', 'more', 'powerful', 'really', 'warrior', 'goddess.The', 'dance', 'routine', 'end', 'pretty', 'involved', 'can', 'get', 'better', 'idea', 'Dolphina', 'dancing', 'skills', 'too', 'definitely', 'more', 'difficult', 'workout', ""'m"", 'very', 'happy', 'tape']",N/A

I am a bit disappointed at this one.  First of all, I don't understand why she didn't produce an intermediate one or slow down the pace in this ""advanced"" one and name it intermediate?  I am barely at intermediate level but I still can use this ""advanced"" just not benefit as much.  Even though I am disappointed but I still would say it is a worthwhile purchase.You can hardly call it a workout because you probably would not burn 50 calories.  Only one third of the program (hips, upper body, undulation,) have a thorough illustration and repetition.  The chest circle and hip circle are hardly illustrated step by step.  Repetition itself is a great workout but there is not enough here. The illustration for ""Figure Eights"" in combination is somehow not clear either. You just have to follow.  This combination part is mainly instructional.  The hips, thighs and buns part gives some workout as I sweat at this point but it is very short.  And then at the shimmy part, it all of sudden gets very difficult/advanced.  The cool down is almost perfunctory.However, I still benefit from some of the movements, especially, the undulations of dolphin and camel moves which I couldn't get it from her first DVD.  So I would still say it is a worthwhile purchase.The background of this program is stark, barren and boring.  A contrast to her first video which is colorful and richly cultured with Eastern style.  The camera angles are much better than her last one though. The workout part is really short, only 30 minutes.  An ideal length should be one hour with more repetition to make perfect and sweat.",3,More Instructional than a Workout,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",2002,1753,"['bought', 'Advanced', 'Bellydance', 'Goddess', 'Workout', 'using', 'Dolphina', 'Introduction', 'Bellydance', 'enjoy', 'tremendously', 'rated', '5', 'stars', 'am', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'one', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'produce', 'intermediate', 'one', 'slow', 'down', 'pace', 'advanced', 'one', 'name', 'intermediate', 'am', 'barely', 'intermediate', 'level', 'still', 'can', 'use', 'advanced', 'just', 'not', 'benefit', 'much', 'Even', 'am', 'disappointed', 'still', 'would', 'say', 'worthwhile', 'purchase.You', 'can', 'hardly', 'call', 'workout', 'probably', 'would', 'not', 'burn', '50', 'calories', 'Only', 'one', 'third', 'program', 'hips', 'upper', 'body', 'undulation', 'have', 'thorough', 'illustration', 'repetition', 'chest', 'circle', 'hip', 'circle', 'are', 'hardly', 'illustrated', 'step', 'step', 'Repetition', 'great', 'workout', 'not', 'enough', 'here', 'illustration', 'Figure', 'Eights', 'combination', 'somehow', 'not', 'clear', 'either', 'just', 'have', 'follow', 'combination', 'part', 'mainly', 'instructional', 'hips', 'thighs', 'buns', 'part', 'workout', 'sweat', 'point', 'very', 'short', 'then', 'shimmy', 'part', 'sudden', 'very', 'difficult/advanced', 'cool', 'down', 'almost', 'perfunctory.However', 'still', 'benefit', 'movements', 'especially', 'undulations', 'dolphin', 'camel', 'moves', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'first', 'DVD', 'would', 'still', 'say', 'worthwhile', 'purchase.The', 'background', 'program', 'stark', 'barren', 'boring', 'contrast', 'first', 'video', 'colorful', 'richly', 'cultured', 'Eastern', 'style', 'camera', 'angles', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'last', 'one', 'though', 'workout', 'part', 'really', 'short', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'ideal', 'length', 'should', 'be', 'one', 'hour', 'more', 'repetition', 'make', 'perfect', 'sweat']",N/A
704958,AX4WI207ZA637,B000068MOS,Casey Snider,"[4, 5]","Dolphina's &quot;Warrior Goddess&quot; is supposed to be the follow-up to &quot;Introduction to Bellydance&quot;.  This is a generally fun workout that really does work most of your body, especially the hips and abs.  The problem is, unless you have practically memorized the first tape you will get lost at times on this one, especially near the end...but if you HAVE memorized the &quot;Introduction&quot; tape, there isn't a whole lot of new stuff here.  Dolphina is a very talky instructor, which is a hit-or-miss proposition; while some of her visualizations are helpful (&quot;holding a flawless ruby in your navel and pushing it out&quot; is great for ab isolations), others are annoying (&quot;You're Pele, warrior goddess of Hawaii&quot;).  To put this in perspective, I'm a Dianic (feminist) Wiccan, and even I found her &quot;You're a goddess&quot; lines irritating, especially since she uses them over and over.  As for the &quot;routine&quot; at the end, unless you have a photographic memory you'll probably want to review it a few times before you attempt it; Dolphina just launches right into it without breaking down the sequence first, plus she gets off the beat so many times it's embarrassing.  The warm-up and cool-down are not as good as the ones on the first tape, so take a little extra time to stretch before and after.

However, if you are already familiar with the vocabulary of bellydance, it works.""Warrior Goddess"" is an exercise program, not instruction. If you think of it as a fitness class where you casually follow the instructor, and you know all the moves, this video is fun! Yes, the camera occasionally focuses on the wrong body parts, but, again, if you have experience studying bellydance, you know what Dolphina is doing- her dance vocabulary is simple and doesn't require a lot of effort to figure out.  I love the sun-lit California swimming pool and blue sky, Dolphina is dancing on a white ""island"" in the middle of the pool. I like the colors, Dolphina's outfits, and I like that she is very comfortable in front of the camera  and that she talks. Unlike some other video bellydance instructors, Dolphina doesn't look tense or lost, she doesn't make ""sexy"" or ""sultry"" faces. Her casual easy attitude makes me feel relaxed. I don't care for the ""every woman is a goddess"" motivational talk, but I don't care for chakras and mudras either - even though I do yoga.

704961,AESPPXJJOPPYH,B000068MOS,Kaulika,"[2, 2]","Dolphina's Warrior Goddess workout is both cheesy and surprisingly inspirational. It's clear that Dolphina is an experienced bellydancer, but she's very... L.A., in the most stereotypical sense of the word. It may feel cheesy at first when she's calling you a ""goddess"" and ""amazing"" - but it becomes surprisingly inspirational, especially for those of us who have body image issues (which may be most of us women). I found the moves in this workout to be more about freeing the body and helping you to feel, well, like a goddess in your own skin, rather than about working yourself to exhaustion.Those who are total beginners to bellydancing may find it useful to begin with Dolphina's beginner video before moving to this one. As someone with some bellydancing experience, I found that this video was alternately wonderful and frustrating. She mostly uses her own names for moves, rather than the traditional ones, and as workouts go, she often focuses only on one side without working the other - when I do this video, I find myself having to pause it while I work the other side.That all being said, you will get out of this workout what you put into it. If you don't really focus on isolation and tight muscle movement, you won't reap the benefits. Bellydancing, after all, isn't about shaking your body carelessly - it is about carefully constructed movement using fiercely conditioned muscles fired in isolation. So, if you really focus and work at using your muscles as she tells you to, you will feel the workout, and depending on your level of fitness, break a decent sweat by the end of it. If you don't, you will get almost nothing out of it.Experienced bellydancers and fitness freaks may find this video a little (or a lot) off-putting. I'd recommend it more for those who are interested in bellydancing, but may have not taken very many classes, and really just like the idea of bellydancing as a way of... well, embracing their inner goddess.

704962,A18VVDLRLG9SVO,B000068MOS,Kimberly Wells,"[17, 17]","This video is more of a workout than Dolphina's intro to bellydance-- which is as expected since this is for the &quot;warrior goddess&quot; as opposed to the beginning goddess.  The moves are much harder to master (I'm a little rusty and plan to go back to the beginner for a refresher now).  Focuses some on the &quot;core&quot; abdominal muscles-- perhaps a little Pilates style coaching.  I definitely felt my abs being stretched!  The focus/direction in this video allow the viewer to see *all* of the whole body's movements--not just head &amp; shoulder shots.  Sometimes Dolphina does go a bit fast in &quot;how to&quot; do the movement-- you'll have to think about it and practice the moves a number of times before mastery.  Keep your clicker handy &amp; rewind and pause.  It'll give you more workout time, anyway-- and we all know you need at least 20 minutes of workout till you get that fatburning anyway!The set is gorgeous and interesting; I always wonder where they find these places-- Dolphina is great, too, but (yay) gone are the &quot;cheesier&quot; aspects of video one, those superimposed shots of Dolphina's head (a la Debbie does Dallas).The routine &amp; cool down do, however, feature two new bellydance costumes that can give you some ideas for your own costuming.  (For those of us addicted to the clothing/fashion of bellydance too).  During the rest of the video, Dolphina's clothing is more what you would wear to a bellydance class, as opposed to a performance.I only gave this one four stars because it is definitely not for beginners, and I felt I would have liked to be able to hear more of the middle eastern music that goes with this style of dance.  But that's just being really picky on my part.  I also think it's going to be much harder for most people to master, so you'll want to get another bellydance video first if you're just starting out.But primarily, for intermediate to advance bellydancers, this will give you much more of a workout and fatburning once mastered.  It's worth being part of your collection-- anything to keep the fitness video boredom from setting in!Still, even the best video will never replace an in-person instructor.

I was disappointed that it was relied on so heavily for this video.  I've always preferred layering moves(think drum solo focus on belly/hips) to travelling steps.  I would have preferred if she had used more layering moves.  Theres a shimmy section (which gets you're heart rate up for a few mintues), and a hip section and an abs section (which are okay), but then a lot of travelling steps.  If you are another dancer who prefers layering over travelling steps, don't get this video.Do to the lack of layering (sorry, bitter) you don't get a great workout.Also,I don't like the way it is broken up into sections: can't we mix it up!!",3,"Sorry, Dolphina",1100995200,"11 21, 2004",2004,714,"['Mostly', 'low', 'review', 'not', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'arabesque', 'move', 'was', 'disappointed', 'was', 'relied', 'heavily', 'video', ""'ve"", 'always', 'preferred', 'layering', 'moves', 'think', 'drum', 'solo', 'focus', 'belly/hips', 'travelling', 'steps', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'had', 'used', 'more', 'layering', 'moves', 'shimmy', 'section', ""'re"", 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'few', 'mintues', 'hip', 'section', 'abs', 'section', 'are', 'then', 'lot', 'travelling', 'steps', 'are', 'dancer', 'who', 'layering', 'over', 'travelling', 'steps', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'video.Do', 'lack', 'layering', 'sorry', 'bitter', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'great', 'workout.Also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'way', 'broken', 'up', 'sections', 'ca', ""n't"", 'mix', 'up']",N/A

Dolphina does not spend a lot of time explaining what to do because this is workout for people who are already familiar with bellydancing moves and dancing in general. If you are, then you will just flow with it.Contrary to other reviews that say the set is boring, I think the set is absolutely beautiful and relaxing and she is really inspiring so this workout is both visually and spiritually engaging.I read another review where it says you'll only burn 50 calories and that's not correct! This workout will make you break a sweat if you do the moves correctly.  If you just throw your hips around and not put the correct emphasis on muscles like your upper and lower abdomen, hips, etc., then of course you will not even sweat, but that applies to all exercise in general.This workout will definitely challenge you and keep you centered while you practice active meditation.

I wasn't disappointed.  Dolphina is a great instructor, and she explains the moves slowly enough so that you get them when she does them slowly.  The atmosphere is very peaceful, and it makes me want to quit my job and do yoga all day (in a good way).Let me just say that I'm glad no one was around while I tried this!  This has to be the most fun I have ever had while doing a workout even though I am sure I looked completely ridiculous.  I did not even come close to mastering any of the moves, but I want to put it in again and try them over.  Even though I muddled my way through the video, my abs, legs, and butt are tired!  I think this is a great video to throw in the VCR when you're bored with your usual workout and feel like being a sexy lady for 45 minutes.My only complaint is that she teaches the moves slowly but then jumps right into doing them quickly.  Before you know it, she's moved on to another move, so you didn't really get to get the first one down.  Therefore it will take me many runs of this tape to really be able to do the moves well.  Despite these complaints, though, I actually WANT to keep trying.  This video would be really fun to do with friends if you don't mind embarrassing yourself.  Of course, you can always use your skills to amaze some guy with your beautiful warrior goddess dancing :)On the whole, kind of difficult, but a lot of fun.  If you don't have the beginner's video down, don't try this one yet.

The videographer pans out to show all of Dolphina's body and even shows different angles, a welcome change from her first video which often focused on her face while she demonstrated something.Dolphina was also a better instructor, describing the movements more in terms of physical actions rather than as spiritual concepts.Finally, Dolphina went over basic form, very important for belly dancing.  This should have been covered in the first video, but better late than never.While my fellow viewer and I were disappointed in the lack of set and costume changes, this isn't much to lose in the light of the fact that the video is so much better in other ways.  The entire video takes place in what looks like an empty swimming pool.

The camera work is better (not perfect though), Dolphina took out her hideous hair weave, dropped the false sexuality and speaks to the viewer like we're a familiar friend.In this video, like in her other videos we start with a warm up, move on to the technique sections (divided into sections for the upper and lower body), practice a short routine and then end with a cool down.  From the beginning of the workout to the end, it's about 40-45 minutes.Dolphina has some difficulties with keeping time.  She sometimes counts unevenly.As in the the other videos, the scenery and outfits are really beautiful to see.Even after many months of owning this video, it still presents a challenge.  It is also fun because after a few tries, you can feel that you are really getting the hang of the moves.

Her first video was great, and I had been looking for a more advanced tape since I have mastered all of the moves. I am glad she has made this new one. I definitely felt it in my abs and legs!! Its just what I needed. She teaches more traveling moves that are very beautiful and sensual to watch. At first I didn't think it was going to make me sweat but by the end I sure was!! My legs burned and then the shimmy section came on and made me feel so good! I love to shimmy! Dolphina chose a gorgeous location to add to the beauty of the moves she teaches. If you are a beginner, definitely get the first video also. You wont regret it. And since she doesn't have a more advanced video out yet, for those of you who want a little more of a challenge, I recommend Suzanna DelVecchio's &quot;Precision Motion Workout&quot;. She will teach you more moves and that one will make you sweat away also!! Its not sold here, but just go to her website and you will find it.
