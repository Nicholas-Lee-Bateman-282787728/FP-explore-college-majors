She says during the workout that it's very effective and it's tough, but I don't feel like it's tough at all.  It's kind of too easy, so I question if it's actually doing anything.My favorite section is the total body.I think the arms section is the hardest and the most work of all the sections.  At least it is for me, but then again my arms are weaker than the rest of my body.The best thing about this DVD is after doing it for two and a half months I see and feel results.  My buns are toned and tightened as are my legs.But, as often happens, I'm getting bored doing the same DVD so often, so I just ordered another DVD with Suzanne Bowen because I really like her as an instructor.

There are some exercises (the abs workout is enough to let the expletives fly) I can barely keep up with. There are variations so it's not impossible. Also the great thing about the 10 minute segments is that you can start out really, really slow. And if you're just beginning I would recommend that. Maybe try just one 10 minute segment (probably the Pilates for Flexibility) for the first week, then add on other workouts incrementally.The only slight downfall is the band. It is helpful with the exercises but it can be awkward. Sometimes I am fumbling with it in between moves and sometimes it pops off my arms or foot.

1084944,A16NQF4IUGU29B,B000S1MM84,Beachbabe1984,"[0, 0]","I'm not usually huge on Pilates DVDs, but I was impressed at how much more challenging this workout was than the average Pilates DVD I've tried before.  Using the band was also a nice change of pace (and it's also great that a band came with the DVD!). The instructor is pleasant - not too perky - and provides good cues.  She is pretty quick with getting her band in position, so there are times when she's started the exercise while I'm still trying to get my band into place.  In fairness, I'm quite clumsy.There are 5 sections:  lower body, upper body, core, total body, and flexibility.  All the sections have some challenging moves in them, but I find the upper body workout to be especially difficult (likely because I have a weak upper body!).  And if you choose to play all the workouts at once, you can really feel your upper body since you're using your shoulders to pull on the band.  There were points in the core section where I might have liked more resistance for my abs, but my arms just couldn't provide it.  However, I really enjoy the total body and flexibility sections.Overall, I think this DVD is a great change of pace for me.  It's great for those days where I want a good workout, but don't necessarily want to be dripping in sweat.  It gets some muscle groups that are hard to work otherwise, so I'm happy to have added this to my routine.",4,Good DVD that will really work your shoulders,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",2009,1366,"[""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'huge', 'Pilates', 'DVDs', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'challenging', 'workout', 'was', 'average', 'Pilates', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'Using', 'band', 'was', 'also', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'also', 'great', 'band', 'came', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'pleasant', 'not', 'too', 'perky', 'good', 'cues', 'pretty', 'quick', 'getting', 'band', 'position', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'started', 'exercise', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'band', 'place', 'fairness', ""'m"", 'quite', 'are', '5', 'sections', 'lower', 'body', 'upper', 'body', 'core', 'total', 'body', 'flexibility', 'sections', 'have', 'challenging', 'moves', 'find', 'upper', 'body', 'workout', 'be', 'especially', 'difficult', 'likely', 'have', 'weak', 'upper', 'body', 'choose', 'play', 'workouts', 'once', 'can', 'really', 'feel', 'upper', 'body', ""'re"", 'using', 'shoulders', 'pull', 'band', 'were', 'points', 'core', 'section', 'where', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'resistance', 'abs', 'arms', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'provide', 'However', 'really', 'enjoy', 'total', 'body', 'flexibility', 'sections.Overall', 'think', 'DVD', 'great', 'change', 'pace', 'great', 'days', 'where', 'want', 'good', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'want', 'be', 'dripping', 'sweat', 'muscle', 'groups', 'are', 'hard', 'work', 'otherwise', ""'m"", 'happy', 'have', 'added', 'routine']",N/A

1084946,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000S1MM84,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[3, 3]","I'm a daily exerciser who has been trying to work more Pilates into my regular routine.  I especially like using Pilates as short, add-on segments, and because I enjoyed another 10 Minute Solution DVD by instructor Suzanne Bowen,Pilates Perfect Body, I thought I would try this one as well.Pilates Slim and Sculpt comes with a long stretchy band that is used with each of the five workouts included on the disk (my band is green, not purple like the one Bowen is using).  As with all of the 10 Minute Solution videos, the Main Menu of this DVD offers the option to Play All, Play One Workout, or to Create Your Own Routine by selecting segments in turn (I found the custom function to be a little tweaky; it kept double-selecting segments for me).  For each segment, Bowen is exercising alone, instructing live in a large open studio.  I have provided brief breakdowns of each 10-minute section below.LOWER BODY PILATESFor this segment, Bowen begins seated with the band around the balls of the feet to briefly focus on the breath.  She then rolls back, and with the band around one foot only, she performs leg circles and leg lifts down and to the side; she transitions with frogs before repeating on the other side.  Coming to a side lying position, the side series work (band around one foot) includes up-down, 3-point, inner thigh lifts, and donkey kicks; again, the series is repeated on the other side.  Bowen concludes this segment holding the band over the pelvis for reverse plank with leg pull-downs and pelvic lifts.UPPER BODY PILATESStarting standing with the band under the feet, Bowen simply holds the band for shoulder rolls forward and back.  Next, she moves into the Pilates zip-up and bug.  Lunging over one leg, she performs boxing and bicep curls and then triceps press and lateral raises on the other side.  Bowen then moves into a side lunge position for draw-the-sword, paint-under-the-stairs (triceps extension), biceps press-ups, and chest presses; this entire series is repeated on the other side.  She finishes the upper body work with a scapular press using the band doubled up, a beach ball chest press (band behind the back), and a few brief stretches.PILATES FOR ABSBowen starts seated with the band under the feet for a brief spine twist.  Coming to lying, she performs the hundred, roll-down (alternating the arms holding the band), and half roll down with the hands together holding the band.  She then bunches up the band and places it between the feet for rolling like a ball.  After brief hip lifts (band across pelvis), Bowen places the band behind her shoulders for single leg stretch, single straight leg stretch, and double leg stretch.  The band then goes back under the feet for leg lowers.  Bowen holds the doubled band between her hands for the teaser, and she concludes with a quick cat/cow stretch (no band).TOTAL BODY PILATESHere Bowen begins standing with the band under one foot for leg lifts out to the side and to the back.  Lunging with the band under one foot, she performs rows and lateral raises on both sides.  Next comes kneeling thigh work holding the band in the hands.  Bowen then places the band on the floor for triceps push-ups, alternating with a side plank/arm raise using the band.  Lying back on her forearms, she bunches up the band and places it between the knees for corkscrew and can-can to finish.PILATES FOR FLEXIBILITYThis final segment again starts standing for standing mermaid holding the band.  Still holding the band, Bowen proceeds to a chest opener and standing saw; she also performs a standing hip stretch and a plie squat with a triceps stretch.  Coming down to the mat, Bowen puts the band aside to perform up dog to down dog, and then child's pose with rotation.  She also does brief holds of low lunge and pigeon pose, rising from the latter into a seated pretzel stretch (using the band again in the hands).  Bowen concludes the flexibility segment on her back for reclined leg stretches with the band and a lying twist.Overall, I was disappointed in this DVD.  First, I didn't think that Bowen made particularly good use of the band--for example, balling it up (i.e., instead of using it for resistance), just seemed like a total waste of time.  Furthermore, Bowen gave little instruction for positioning the band in order to obtain maximum utility from it.  Second, the pacing and general design of these workouts just felt off.  Some exercises are only performed ONCE, while others are done for many repetitions.  In addition, the holds in the flexibility segment were MUCH too brief to provide any real benefits.I do think Bowen is a good instructor, and this is certainly a well-produced video, with nice production values.  But personally, I would not recommend this DVD.",3,Five 10-minute Pilates routines with some interesting moves,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",2012,4766,"[""'m"", 'daily', 'exerciser', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'work', 'more', 'Pilates', 'regular', 'routine', 'especially', 'using', 'Pilates', 'short', 'add-on', 'segments', 'enjoyed', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'Suzanne', 'Bowen', 'Pilates', 'Perfect', 'Body', 'thought', 'would', 'try', 'one', 'well.Pilates', 'Slim', 'Sculpt', 'long', 'stretchy', 'band', 'used', 'five', 'workouts', 'included', 'disk', 'band', 'green', 'not', 'purple', 'one', 'Bowen', 'using', '10', 'Minute', 'Solution', 'videos', 'Main', 'Menu', 'DVD', 'option', 'Play', 'Play', 'One', 'Workout', 'Create', 'Own', 'Routine', 'selecting', 'segments', 'turn', 'found', 'custom', 'function', 'be', 'little', 'tweaky', 'kept', 'double-selecting', 'segments', 'segment', 'Bowen', 'exercising', 'alone', 'instructing', 'live', 'large', 'open', 'studio', 'have', 'provided', 'brief', 'breakdowns', '10-minute', 'section', 'below.LOWER', 'BODY', 'PILATESFor', 'segment', 'Bowen', 'seated', 'band', 'balls', 'feet', 'briefly', 'focus', 'breath', 'then', 'back', 'band', 'one', 'foot', 'only', 'leg', 'circles', 'leg', 'lifts', 'down', 'side', 'frogs', 'repeating', 'other', 'side', 'Coming', 'side', 'lying', 'position', 'side', 'series', 'work', 'band', 'one', 'foot', 'up-down', '3-point', 'inner', 'thigh', 'lifts', 'donkey', 'kicks', 'again', 'series', 'repeated', 'other', 'side', 'Bowen', 'segment', 'holding', 'band', 'pelvis', 'reverse', 'plank', 'leg', 'pull-downs', 'pelvic', 'lifts.UPPER', 'BODY', 'PILATESStarting', 'standing', 'band', 'feet', 'Bowen', 'simply', 'band', 'shoulder', 'rolls', 'forward', 'back', 'Next', 'Pilates', 'zip-up', 'bug', 'Lunging', 'one', 'leg', 'boxing', 'bicep', 'curls', 'then', 'triceps', 'press', 'lateral', 'raises', 'other', 'side', 'Bowen', 'then', 'side', 'lunge', 'position', 'draw-the-sword', 'paint-under-the-stairs', 'triceps', 'extension', 'press-ups', 'chest', 'presses', 'entire', 'series', 'repeated', 'other', 'side', 'upper', 'body', 'work', 'scapular', 'press', 'using', 'band', 'doubled', 'up', 'beach', 'ball', 'chest', 'press', 'band', 'back', 'few', 'brief', 'stretches.PILATES', 'ABSBowen', 'starts', 'seated', 'band', 'feet', 'brief', 'spine', 'twist', 'Coming', 'lying', 'hundred', 'roll-down', 'alternating', 'arms', 'holding', 'band', 'half', 'roll', 'down', 'hands', 'together', 'holding', 'band', 'then', 'up', 'band', 'feet', 'rolling', 'ball', 'brief', 'hip', 'lifts', 'band', 'pelvis', 'Bowen', 'band', 'shoulders', 'single', 'leg', 'stretch', 'single', 'straight', 'leg', 'stretch', 'double', 'leg', 'stretch', 'band', 'then', 'back', 'feet', 'leg', 'lowers', 'Bowen', 'doubled', 'band', 'hands', 'teaser', 'quick', 'cat/cow', 'stretch', 'band', 'BODY', 'PILATESHere', 'Bowen', 'standing', 'band', 'one', 'foot', 'leg', 'lifts', 'out', 'side', 'back', 'Lunging', 'band', 'one', 'foot', 'rows', 'lateral', 'raises', 'sides', 'Next', 'kneeling', 'thigh', 'work', 'holding', 'band', 'hands', 'Bowen', 'then', 'band', 'floor', 'triceps', 'push-ups', 'alternating', 'side', 'plank/arm', 'raise', 'using', 'band', 'Lying', 'back', 'forearms', 'band', 'knees', 'corkscrew', 'can-can', 'finish.PILATES', 'FOR', 'FLEXIBILITYThis', 'final', 'segment', 'again', 'standing', 'standing', 'mermaid', 'holding', 'band', 'Still', 'holding', 'band', 'Bowen', 'chest', 'opener', 'standing', 'saw', 'also', 'standing', 'hip', 'stretch', 'plie', 'squat', 'triceps', 'stretch', 'Coming', 'down', 'mat', 'Bowen', 'band', 'aside', 'perform', 'up', 'dog', 'down', 'dog', 'then', 'child', 'pose', 'rotation', 'also', 'brief', 'low', 'lunge', 'pigeon', 'pose', 'rising', 'latter', 'seated', 'pretzel', 'stretch', 'using', 'band', 'again', 'hands', 'Bowen', 'flexibility', 'segment', 'back', 'reclined', 'leg', 'stretches', 'band', 'lying', 'twist.Overall', 'was', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'First', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Bowen', 'made', 'particularly', 'good', 'use', 'band', 'example', 'balling', 'up', 'i.e.', 'instead', 'using', 'resistance', 'just', 'seemed', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'Furthermore', 'Bowen', 'gave', 'little', 'instruction', 'positioning', 'band', 'order', 'obtain', 'maximum', 'utility', 'Second', 'pacing', 'general', 'design', 'workouts', 'just', 'felt', 'off', 'exercises', 'are', 'only', 'performed', 'ONCE', 'others', 'are', 'done', 'many', 'repetitions', 'addition', 'flexibility', 'segment', 'were', 'MUCH', 'too', 'brief', 'provide', 'real', 'benefits.I', 'do', 'think', 'Bowen', 'good', 'instructor', 'certainly', 'well-produced', 'video', 'nice', 'production', 'values', 'personally', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'DVD']",N/A

The only problem (as with many, many Pilates called videos) is that the instructor never refers to the guiding principles of the Pilates method (breathing, centering, concentration, control, precision, flow).

If not, maybe you'll not be doing Pilates and you'll be missing all the benefits you could access if you knew how to practice the method.

1084948,A83CZYODDQQOT,B000S1MM84,Chickenmonkey,"[1, 1]","I own a few of the 10 minute solution videos and this is definitely one of my new favorites. Just like all the other 10 minute solution videos this is split up into 5 10-minute workouts. The segments are as follows- Upper body pilates, lower body pilates, pilates for abs, total body pilates, and pilates for flexibility (stretching segment). My favorite segments were the ab segment and the flexibility segment. The instructor is Suzanne Bowen and I really like her- she is pleasant to listen to and she does a really good job of cuing and properly demonstrating the moves. The band really takes each exercise up a notch and she uses some innovative and different twists on some old exercises, which keep the video interesting. I had a great time doing this workout (it was actually quite relaxing), but a few hours after I am really feeling it, so I know that it was VERY effective (especially considering that I exercise every day and I am REALLY sore tonight!). She shows modifications for the more difficult exercises too, so you can choose what level you feel most comfortable with. Because you are in control of how much tension goes on the band, I would say that this video could be used by beginners right up through advanced exercisers. As you get better you just increase the resistance and you can still get a fantastic workout. I highly recommend this, especially for those who enjoy pilates but want to try something a little out of the ordinary.

Except for one exercise in the abs section, the rest was easy, even after I changed to a tighter band. As with the other 10-min workouts, this one comes in five 10-min parts, four parts each focusing on specific area of the body, and then one ""all-over"" workout. The ""all-over workout"" part, I found way easy. The pauses at the 10-min intervals bug me, as do the pauses in other 10-min workouts. I think this will be my last purchase of 10-min workouts, they don't work well for me. Funny thing is, I have the Core Fusion Leaned and Toned workout which also comes in five 10-min workouts, and then one approx 6 min stretch, and those pauses don't affect me.

1084950,A3PO3YRFX4BI2J,B000S1MM84,CMCM,"[29, 29]","This is actually one of the better videos I've found.  I have a lot of exercise videos to compare it to, including many on yoga and pilates, and I really like this one a lot.  The workout is direct and clear.  Suzanne demonstrates, sets it up, often notes easier alternatives, and then does the workout with you.  No fancy production and music, no annoying chitter chatter, but that's a good thing. There's an introduction segment, but you can skip that and then the five separate exercise sections just get down to business.  The exercises flow rather fast, so it's best to watch everything first to familiarize yourself with the positions.  It may seem too fast at first, but you will appreciate the speed later on when you know the routines and just want to do them as efficiently as possible.  I really like the flow of things within each segment.I hadn't used bands before (a band comes with the video) and had thought they were probably not very useful, but after using the band I've come to think it's a very good tool for pilates.  The band doesn't really take the place of Pilates equipment, nor does it replace weights etc.  The band with this video doesn't provide a lot of actual resistance (I suspect it's a ""light"" weight band, although nothing defines what level it is).  The degree of resistance it provides seems to help you stay in the proper position and you can thus focus on the movements rather than getting distracted by holding yourself in a particular pose. This seems to make things easier on your neck and lower back, for example.I like the organization:  five 10-minute segments, divided into body parts such as lower body, upper body, abs, etc.  For one thing, you know going into a segment exactly what is being targeted.  You can do as many of the segments as you want at any particular time, and if limited by time to just one or two, you can easily choose which body areas you want to do that day. I like that particular feature since I often like to work on certain areas more than others so I like being able to find the appropriate section quickly.  Suzanne is very pleasant to watch and her explanations and cues are very clear.  She has a good clear voice and a nice manner overall.At first glance this video could look deceptively simple (especially if you just judge it by watching it rather than doing it!).  Some of the exercises LOOKED quite simple but on doing them, I realized they were not simple at all when you got beyond the first few reps and they most definitely were working the targeted muscles.  And any of these routines could actually be made harder by just doing more reps.  This would be true even for someone who is a more experienced exerciser, which I consider myself to be.  This DVD was NOT too easy.  And I don't feel it would be too hard for beginning exercisers.  Easier modifications for certain exercises are included for those who need them in the beginning.A previous reviewer noted a lack of Pilates principles, and that is true.  This seems more like an exercise video which uses Pilates exercises but it isn't strongly teaching you Pilates per se.  If you want true Pilates, you'd probably want one of the very serious Pilates videos such as the Rael, Winsor or Caban series, all of  which seriously lay the Pilates system all out, both by philosophy, form, breathing, etc.My only suggestion would be that somewhere they include information about what level band was included and how one can progress in band stiffness or if that is even needed or desired.",5,Excellent Video,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,3529,"['actually', 'one', 'better', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'found', 'have', 'lot', 'exercise', 'videos', 'compare', 'including', 'many', 'yoga', 'pilates', 'really', 'one', 'lot', 'workout', 'direct', 'clear', 'Suzanne', 'sets', 'up', 'often', 'easier', 'alternatives', 'then', 'workout', 'fancy', 'production', 'music', 'annoying', 'chitter', 'chatter', 'good', 'thing', 'introduction', 'segment', 'can', 'skip', 'then', 'five', 'separate', 'exercise', 'sections', 'just', 'get', 'down', 'business', 'exercises', 'flow', 'rather', 'fast', 'best', 'watch', 'everything', 'first', 'familiarize', 'positions', 'may', 'seem', 'too', 'fast', 'first', 'will', 'appreciate', 'speed', 'later', 'when', 'know', 'routines', 'just', 'want', 'do', 'as', 'efficiently', 'possible', 'really', 'flow', 'things', 'segment.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'used', 'bands', 'band', 'video', 'had', 'thought', 'were', 'probably', 'not', 'very', 'useful', 'using', 'band', ""'ve"", 'come', 'think', 'very', 'good', 'tool', 'pilates', 'band', ""n't"", 'really', 'take', 'place', 'Pilates', 'equipment', 'replace', 'weights', 'etc', 'band', 'video', ""n't"", 'provide', 'lot', 'actual', 'resistance', 'suspect', 'light', 'weight', 'band', 'nothing', 'defines', 'what', 'level', 'degree', 'resistance', 'help', 'stay', 'proper', 'position', 'can', 'thus', 'focus', 'movements', 'rather', 'getting', 'distracted', 'holding', 'particular', 'pose', 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'neck', 'lower', 'back', 'example.I', 'organization', 'five', '10-minute', 'segments', 'divided', 'body', 'parts', 'such', 'lower', 'body', 'upper', 'body', 'abs', 'etc', 'one', 'thing', 'know', 'going', 'segment', 'exactly', 'what', 'being', 'targeted', 'can', 'do', 'many', 'segments', 'want', 'particular', 'time', 'limited', 'time', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'can', 'easily', 'choose', 'body', 'areas', 'want', 'do', 'day', 'like', 'particular', 'feature', 'often', 'like', 'work', 'certain', 'areas', 'more', 'others', 'so', 'like', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'appropriate', 'section', 'quickly', 'Suzanne', 'very', 'pleasant', 'watch', 'explanations', 'cues', 'are', 'very', 'clear', 'good', 'clear', 'voice', 'nice', 'manner', 'first', 'glance', 'video', 'could', 'look', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'especially', 'just', 'judge', 'watching', 'rather', 'doing', 'exercises', 'LOOKED', 'quite', 'simple', 'doing', 'realized', 'were', 'not', 'simple', 'when', 'got', 'first', 'few', 'reps', 'most', 'definitely', 'were', 'working', 'targeted', 'muscles', 'routines', 'could', 'actually', 'be', 'made', 'harder', 'just', 'doing', 'more', 'reps', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'even', 'someone', 'who', 'more', 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'consider', 'be', 'DVD', 'was', 'NOT', 'too', 'easy', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'beginning', 'exercisers', 'Easier', 'modifications', 'certain', 'exercises', 'are', 'included', 'who', 'need', 'beginning.A', 'previous', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'lack', 'Pilates', 'principles', 'true', 'more', 'exercise', 'video', 'Pilates', 'exercises', ""n't"", 'strongly', 'teaching', 'Pilates', 'se', 'want', 'true', 'Pilates', ""'d"", 'probably', 'want', 'one', 'very', 'serious', 'Pilates', 'videos', 'such', 'Rael', 'Winsor', 'Caban', 'series', 'seriously', 'lay', 'Pilates', 'system', 'out', 'philosophy', 'form', 'breathing', 'only', 'suggestion', 'would', 'be', 'somewhere', 'include', 'information', 'what', 'level', 'band', 'was', 'included', 'how', 'one', 'can', 'progress', 'band', 'stiffness', 'even', 'needed', 'desired']",N/A

She could take a cue from Ellen Barrett who is fantastic.  I understand that there's a time constraint involved; however, I would think that with fitness videos such as this that are trying to give you a good workout within a short amount of time, that they would utilize the fitness mantra of ""It's not the quantity...it's the quality"" of exercise and not do as many reps so that one isn't being rushed.As with another reviewer, the band can be a hindrance as it gets crinkled and you waste time trying to unravel it.  By the time you get it unraveled, she's moved on to the next exercise.  Her band never seems to need unwinding.

With the band, you can hold it in different positions to give yourself more of a challenge (like making it shorter to up the resistance).Suzanne Bowen is a good instructor and she is friendly and cues really well.  This workout is fun and easy enough to do and I especially love the stretch.  I like doing this whole workout in different orders each time (keeping the stretch till the end though) to not let myself get bored.

The moves are very effective and unique.  The instructor, Suzanne Bowen, gives wonderful cuing, very helpful in describing the moves before they are done and gives good modifications when possible.
