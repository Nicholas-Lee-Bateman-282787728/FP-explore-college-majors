I watched ""Sorority House Massacre"" back in the day and remember it being above-par as far as bad slashers go.  Clearly, I was out of my teenage mind.  These movies are flat-out TERRIBLE.  The first one is a blatant (and BAD) ripoff of ""Halloween"" and the second one is a second-rate Skinemax pic.  The girls run around in tight lacy bras, thongs and teddies.  And the acting is beyond horrid.  Not fun to watch.  Just bad and stupid.  Sorry.  For a really bad and FUN slasher pic, I recommend the bombastic, jaw-dropping ""Pieces"" (""BAAAATARDDDD!

I agree that originality is not what the makers of this film had in mind ,and the plot centers on a girl in her mid teens named Beth who went by the name Laura back in her childhood who is now living in a sorority house with several other females and having nightmares about a man who was her brother that murdered her family, and she was the only survivor who managed to escape in a small opening in the house where he tried to get to her , but than buried the knife in a fireplace before police finally came. Now, some 13-14 years later her brother is starting to sense her presence in the house and having spastic fits manages to assault a staff member in the mental institution and escapes to come for her. Throughout the movie there were some influences of both HALLOWEEN/ THE SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE , so I could understand the reviewers crying halloween ripoff while viewing this movie , but most slashers never really are original and this is worth adding to a collection of slashers.",3,PYSCHO ON THE LOOSE.,1177200000,"04 22, 2007",2007,1194,"['one', 'many', 'low-', 'budget', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'saw', 'probably', 'back', 'high', 'school', 'i', 'forgot', 'about', 'having', 'seen', 'few', 'times', 'have', 'included', 'collection', 'favorite', 'slasher', 'movies', 'agree', 'originality', 'not', 'what', 'makers', 'film', 'had', 'mind', 'plot', 'centers', 'girl', 'mid', 'teens', 'named', 'Beth', 'who', 'went', 'name', 'Laura', 'back', 'childhood', 'who', 'now', 'living', 'sorority', 'house', 'several', 'other', 'females', 'having', 'nightmares', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'brother', 'murdered', 'family', 'was', 'only', 'survivor', 'who', 'managed', 'escape', 'small', 'opening', 'house', 'where', 'tried', 'get', 'buried', 'knife', 'fireplace', 'police', 'finally', 'came', 'Now', '13-14', 'years', 'later', 'brother', 'starting', 'sense', 'presence', 'house', 'having', 'spastic', 'fits', 'manages', 'assault', 'staff', 'member', 'mental', 'institution', 'escapes', 'come', 'movie', 'were', 'influences', 'HALLOWEEN/', 'THE', 'SLUMBER', 'PARTY', 'MASSACRE', 'could', 'understand', 'reviewers', 'crying', 'halloween', 'ripoff', 'viewing', 'movie', 'most', 'slashers', 'never', 'really', 'are', 'original', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'slashers']",Sorority House Massacre

486279,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,6305976449,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[4, 5]","The 80's saw a whole lot of massacring in terms of young, comely co-eds in film as Roger Corman, with his New Concorde film group cashed in on the phenomena known as the slasher flick.  Often times he's credited as a trendsetter, and that's partially true as he was the first to introduce the biker flicks of the late 60's with The Wild Angels (1966) and brought psychedelic imagery to the mainstream with The Trip (1967), but it seemed more often than not his features `rode the wave', copying better, previously released, popular films at a very low cost in an effort to make some easy dough off an currently established genre or motif.  This was especially true, in my opinion, of his latter projects with Concorde.  Is there anything wrong with that?  Certainly not, but the results tended to be less than spectacular, as is the case with Sorority House Massacre (1987).  Written and directed by Carol Frank, whose previous credits include being an assistant to the director of the film The Slumber Party Massacre (1982) - keep in mind I said assistant to the director, not assistant director -, Sorority House Massacre stars Angela O'Neill (Alien Nation), whose since found a career behind the scenes as a property master, Nicole Rio (who could forget her role in 1987's Terminal Exposure as `Hostage Girl'?), and a bunch of other people you've never heard of...The film begins with some especially cheap looking titles, followed by a young woman, who we later come to know as Beth (O'Neill), approaching a sorority house.  Seems she visiting some friends for the weekend, and they're planning a party of sorts.  As Beth enters the house, she starts having strange images flash through her mind, which we'll see more of later.  These scenes are intercut with scenes of a mental patient having a spastic attack in a local, state run facility for the deranged and unhinged.  With a majority of the sorority members gone, this leaves four girls (I use the term `girls' loosely as they all appear to be in their mid-20's), including Beth, to go through the rich girls closet (she also left), and allow for the audience to see much boobery as they try one her clothes.  Anyway, the mental guy escapes (partially due to the most lax security I've ever seen in a mental institution), and some guys show up at the sorority house, friends of the girls.  Here's where we learn from one of the guys (of course he would know all about it, only for the fact that it's in the script) that the house has a past, one involving a series of murders before it became a sorority house.  Beth keeps having strange visions of the house and past incidents, indicating she may have some involvement with these past events, and hypnosis (one of the girls is a psych major, of course, so she knows how to hypnotize people) reveals a bit more.  Soon the escaped loony man shows up and initiates a `depopulation' program at the house, picking off those in attendance one by one...who will be left standing by the end of the film (you probably won't care much)?  And what's the connection between the killer, the house, and Beth (if you can't figure it out in the first 20 minutes, you need to get out more)?I didn't think this was going to be great, but then again I didn't think it was going to be as craptacular as it was...the dialog was rancid, the acting extremely poor (there's virtually no emotion towards the recent and continuing deaths of their friends), hardly any tension, and what has to be one of the most annoying music scores for a film I've heard in a long time.  Nearly all the scares stemmed from the characters within the group walking up behind each other and scaring (oh, but not on purpose) the unsuspecting individual, although it was satisfying to see one guy, Craig, get kneed in the crotch by his girlfriend.  And speaking of the character of Craig, I have to say he was a real winner...here his girlfriend is getting slaughtered by a killer and he just runs away.  He didn't even lift a finger to help her, and he certainly could have...oh well, such acts of cowardice will not go unpunished.  I think my favorite line of dialog was when Beth was talking about her dreams and she states, `I don't get it.  Something really awful must be going on in my head!'...yeah, in your head, and in this movie...I think the thing that annoyed me the most about this film was it was just so predictable, and there seemed little effort to make it anything more than what it was...the killer's identity is revealed early on, along with the connections between him, the house, and Beth, so what's left?  Nothing...it's like riding a roller coaster with the big thrill being at the very beginning, and then the rest of the ride being really tame (except this was more like one of those kiddie coasters that rides about two feet off the ground).  I will say the best thing about the film, beside the various T & A shots (mostly T, but not a lot of A), was the fact it had a running time of about 1 hour and 13 minutes.  I suppose picking at this film is like flogging a dead horse, but, as I mentioned earlier, if I thought any real effort to try and churn something relatively decent out had been made, I would have been less inclined to trash on it so...The full screen picture on this DVD does look pretty good, even if the film itself stinks.  Also, the 2 channel stereo audio is decent.  There are a couple of extras including cast bios, an original trailer (which has Spanish subtitles for some reason), along with trailers for Seduction of Innocence (1996), Emmanuelle: First Contact (2000), and The Slumber Party Massacre (1982).  This film was followed by Sorority House Massacre II (1990), which appear to have been done in a campier vein.Cookieman108By the way, the killing scenes weren't very good, either...and if you want to know the body count, I figured it to be around 9 or so...",2,"Who will survive the final exam?

486280,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6305976449,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 5]","Sorority House Massacre has to be one of the most boring slasher films I've ever seen.  Take everything great about 80s slashers - and throw them right out the window because you won't find a trace of them here.  I can't believe any true horror fan would give this film more than two stars.  From the plodding, ultra-predictable plot to the lame dialogue, this is a one-way trip to disappointment.  The whole thing is basically a clich&eacute;d, unimaginative rehash of Halloween, minus all of the fear, suspense, and good acting.With the house mother and most of their sisters gone, these sorority girls are planning on a wild and crazy weekend.  They get the fun started by stealing into one girl's room and trying on all of her clothes.  Wowza!  Then the boys get there, and things really get crazy.  My heart was beating out of my chest as I watched the gang sit down to tell ghost stories and watch television.  I'm telling you - these girls are out of control.  And believe you me, it isn't easy to cut loose and go crazy like this when one of the girls keeps going on and about her dreams of some crazy man trying to kill her.  That would be Beth (Angela O'Neill), who doesn't know it yet, but she just so happens to be spending a few days in the house where the brother she doesn't remember killed the family she doesn't remember some thirteen years earlier.  She, of course, was the only member of her family to survive.  Her brother Bobby (John C. Russell) certainly remembers her, though; somehow sensing the fact that she has returned to the old house, he manages to escape from a mental hospital with every intention of finishing what he started all those years ago.I don't know which is worst: the story, the acting, or the dialogue.  And where did they find these cast members?  I wasn't exactly Mr. Smooth back in the 1980s, but I had more going on than these losers.  And where are the babes?  I hate to sound cruel, but this has to be the plainest bunch of sorority girls I've ever seen.  Angela O'Neill actually makes K.D. Lang look voluptuous.  Yeah, there's some nudity (especially during that thrilling ""let's try on Cindy's clothes"" montage), but there is absolutely nothing to get excited about.  Frankly, I can't blame the one dude who chose to go rafting over spending the weekend with his girlfriend at the unsupervised sorority house.  Life was more exciting on Walton's Mountain than it was at this Greek house (even after the killer showed up).",2,Don't judge all 1980s slashers by this one,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",2012,2474,"['Sorority', 'House', 'Massacre', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'slasher', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Take', 'everything', 'great', '80s', 'slashers', 'throw', 'right', 'out', 'window', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'trace', 'here', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'true', 'horror', 'fan', 'would', 'give', 'film', 'more', 'two', 'stars', 'plodding', 'ultra-predictable', 'plot', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'one-way', 'trip', 'disappointment', 'whole', 'thing', 'basically', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'unimaginative', 'rehash', 'Halloween', 'fear', 'suspense', 'good', 'acting.With', 'house', 'mother', 'most', 'sisters', 'gone', 'sorority', 'girls', 'are', 'planning', 'wild', 'crazy', 'weekend', 'get', 'fun', 'started', 'stealing', 'one', 'girl', 'room', 'trying', 'clothes', 'Wowza', 'Then', 'boys', 'get', 'there', 'things', 'really', 'get', 'crazy', 'heart', 'was', 'beating', 'chest', 'watched', 'gang', 'sit', 'down', 'tell', 'ghost', 'stories', 'watch', 'television', ""'m"", 'telling', 'girls', 'are', 'control', 'believe', ""n't"", 'easy', 'cut', 'loose', 'go', 'crazy', 'when', 'one', 'girls', 'going', 'dreams', 'crazy', 'man', 'trying', 'kill', 'would', 'be', 'Beth', 'Angela', ""O'Neill"", 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'spending', 'few', 'days', 'house', 'where', 'brother', ""n't"", 'remember', 'killed', 'family', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thirteen', 'years', 'earlier', 'course', 'was', 'only', 'member', 'family', 'survive', 'brother', 'Bobby', 'John', 'C.', 'Russell', 'certainly', 'though', 'somehow', 'sensing', 'fact', 'returned', 'old', 'house', 'escape', 'mental', 'hospital', 'intention', 'finishing', 'what', 'started', 'years', 'ago.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'worst', 'story', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'where', 'did', 'find', 'cast', 'members', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'Mr', 'Smooth', 'back', '1980s', 'had', 'more', 'going', 'losers', 'where', 'are', 'babes', 'hate', 'sound', 'cruel', 'be', 'plainest', 'bunch', 'sorority', 'girls', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Angela', ""O'Neill"", 'actually', 'K.D', 'Lang', 'look', 'voluptuous', 'Yeah', 'nudity', 'especially', 'thrilling', 'let', 'try', 'Cindy', 'clothes', 'montage', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'get', 'excited', 'Frankly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'one', 'dude', 'who', 'chose', 'go', 'rafting', 'spending', 'weekend', 'girlfriend', 'unsupervised', 'sorority', 'house', 'Life', 'was', 'more', 'exciting', 'Walton', 'Mountain', 'was', 'Greek', 'house', 'even', 'killer', 'showed', 'up']",Sorority House Massacre
486281,A2VIY4M4GGJHXY,6305976449,"David Koski ""b-movie fan""","[6, 6]","This movie is a farily typical slasher/late teen girl movie for the most part, but I think the director went a little overboard trying to give it a plot and depth.

In other words, ""Sorority House Massacre"" could have been a lot better, but this movie has the worst acting and directing I have ever seen in a slasher flick and that's saying a lot.""Sorority House Massacre"" is a complete failure of a horror movie because it is simply not scary and totally unconvincing in its attempt to evoke any horror in the audience.  The acting is so bad that it's laughable and pathetic.A college girl named Beth is haunted by visions of her past in nightmares about her brother (named Bobby) killing her entire family except for her of course.  The significance of the sorority house is that it is where Beth's family was murdered and so there is this return to the scene of the crime theme throughout the movie.The death scenes are rather poor and I was disapointed pretty much throughout the movie.  All and all, this is not a good movie because the acting and directing were so terrible...a couple of frightful scenes in this movie from Beth's nightmares, but nothing that can save this movie from being dumped as a below average slasher flick.The movie could have been a lot better if better actors were chosen for this flick.

486287,A236PDCSYIOQBU,6305976449,"K. Cope ""Kcope""","[2, 2]","In the 80's slasher movies were it. However, women we're often portrayed as just sex objects, so the women's rights activitists had to put a stop to that. (That's something I could never figure out because in almost every 80's movie, the hero of the film was a woman). So a few women wrote some slasher movies with pretty obvious I am woman, hear me roar themes in them. The most obvious being slumber party massacre one, with the drill as a ""symbol"" for something else. However, I always found these movies to be pretty decent, and soroity house massacre is one of them.The first thing I always look for in a horror movie is, is the movie well made, and is the acting believable? Where this movie faulters, is in the well made catergory. Some parts of it, the music is really hokey, the camera work is pretty poor and it seems like some of the times the director just didn't care about continuity. (there's a guy running naked, and then in the next scene he's in underware). It's just little things you notice that make the movie seem cheap. The acting is pretty good, no real complaints here.The next thing I look for are the death sequences. Are they cool and do they make sense? I thought this is where this movie really kicked butt. I think the scene where she is in the dining room and the blood starts running down the walls was pretty neat. The death sequences were pretty cool, and there was some definate tension that you could feel which kept me looking behind me for most of the movie.The last thing I look for is, does the ending wrap up the movie? In this case, it does. The ending is pretty intense and clears everything up for you. Many people compare this movie to Halloween, and there are some definite similarities here. The formula is the same, but for what horror movie aren't they the same?This movie is a pretty good movie, that could have really been a great movie. It's a shame it is made so poorly in some parts, because it really detracts from the rest of the movie. That's why I gave it three stars, instead of five. It really had potential, and some parts really had me creeped out. However, I'd definitely recommend seeing the movie once, and it might be worth you buying it. It's kindof an embarrassing movie to buy though, because everyone thinks its an erotic film ;)",3,I gave it three... but this movie could have been a five.,1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2300,"['80', 'slasher', 'movies', 'were', 'However', 'women', ""'re"", 'often', 'portrayed', 'just', 'sex', 'objects', 'women', 'rights', 'activitists', 'had', 'put', 'stop', 'something', 'could', 'never', 'figure', 'out', 'almost', '80', 'movie', 'hero', 'film', 'was', 'woman', 'few', 'women', 'wrote', 'slasher', 'movies', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'am', 'woman', 'hear', 'roar', 'themes', 'most', 'obvious', 'being', 'slumber', 'party', 'massacre', 'one', 'drill', 'symbol', 'something', 'else', 'However', 'always', 'found', 'movies', 'be', 'pretty', 'decent', 'soroity', 'house', 'massacre', 'one', 'them.The', 'first', 'thing', 'always', 'look', 'horror', 'movie', 'movie', 'well', 'made', 'acting', 'believable', 'Where', 'movie', 'faulters', 'well', 'made', 'catergory', 'parts', 'music', 'really', 'hokey', 'camera', 'work', 'pretty', 'poor', 'times', 'director', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'continuity', 'guy', 'running', 'naked', 'then', 'next', 'scene', 'underware', 'just', 'little', 'things', 'notice', 'make', 'movie', 'seem', 'cheap', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'real', 'complaints', 'here.The', 'next', 'thing', 'look', 'are', 'death', 'sequences', 'Are', 'cool', 'do', 'make', 'sense', 'thought', 'where', 'movie', 'really', 'kicked', 'butt', 'think', 'scene', 'where', 'dining', 'room', 'blood', 'running', 'down', 'walls', 'was', 'pretty', 'neat', 'death', 'sequences', 'were', 'pretty', 'cool', 'was', 'definate', 'tension', 'could', 'feel', 'kept', 'looking', 'most', 'movie.The', 'last', 'thing', 'look', 'ending', 'wrap', 'movie', 'case', 'ending', 'pretty', 'intense', 'clears', 'everything', 'up', 'Many', 'people', 'compare', 'movie', 'Halloween', 'are', 'definite', 'similarities', 'here', 'formula', 'same', 'what', 'horror', 'movie', 'are', ""n't"", 'same', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'great', 'movie', 'shame', 'made', 'so', 'poorly', 'parts', 'really', 'rest', 'movie', 'why', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'instead', 'five', 'really', 'had', 'potential', 'parts', 'really', 'had', 'creeped', 'out', 'However', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'recommend', 'seeing', 'movie', 'once', 'might', 'be', 'buying', 'embarrassing', 'movie', 'buy', 'everyone', 'erotic', 'film']",Sorority House Massacre

In fact, SHM has been criticized for being a little too close in tone and theme to Halloween.  But, after 1978, what slasher movie WASN'T ripping off Halloween.  The difference is, 99.8 percent of all the movies that followed in its wake were terrible -- unimaginative and boring.  SHM, though, is kind of a little gem among all that dreck.  Working with what clearly seems to be a budget of 11 dollars and 24 cents, writer/director Carol Frank manages to create a little slasher flick with characters that are, if not fully three dimensional, at least two and half dimensional.  The women of the sorority are likable and resourceful ... a refreshing change from the screaming, naked girls of the other 99.8 percent of these types of movies.  They stick together and fight a menace that is basically Michael Myers without the eerie mask.  Especially noteworthy is Wendy Martel as Linda, a psyche major with brains and bravery to spare. -- There is no ""He's Dead But He's Not Dead"" ending that was really the icing on the cake of the other unimaginative Halloween rip-offs.  SHM isn't a 'classic' of the slasher genre (a list tht probably realistically is comprised of about four movies), but it is a nice little low-budget thriller with a cast of characters that you actually root for. -- My review is basically for the first SHM.  The second one comes with the first, and for its price, it's worth owning both.  The second isn't nearly as well done or well thought out as the first, but it's still fun.

I got this expecting to see a very cheesy movie, after seeing the even cheesier &quot;Sorority House Massacre&quot; 2 &amp; 3 movies before; actually, this is the least cheesiest of the series, besides the extra speical, ten-minute &quot;dress-up&quot; montage. It also goes by alot faster than the first installment in it's sister-series, the slumber party movies, although it's only shorter by two minutes (it's 75 minutes all together); it goes by like that &lt;snap!&gt;. It also lacks the scares and suspense of the first &quot;Slumber Party Massacre&quot; movie. What it lacks in scares, however, it makes up in good production values. The acting is not completely bad, and the conversation scripture is every bit as good as that of &quot;Halloween&quot;. The dream sequence in the begining is pretty neat.

I can only reluctantly reccomend it, but suggest seeing the much more supierior &quot;House on Sorority Row&quot; instead...",2,Eh...,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",2004,1322,"['former', 'murderer', 'escapes', 'mental', 'institution', 'stalks', 'teenage', 'girls', 'could', 'outline', 'quot', 'Halloween', 'quot', 'quot', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'quot', 'quot', 'Soroity', 'House', 'Massacre', 'quot', 'films', 'share', 'similarities', 'Aside', 'tbe', 'films', 'un-originality', 'not', 'completely', 'bad', 'got', 'expecting', 'see', 'very', 'cheesy', 'movie', 'seeing', 'even', 'cheesier', 'quot', 'Sorority', 'House', 'Massacre', 'quot', '2', 'amp', '3', 'movies', 'actually', 'least', 'cheesiest', 'series', 'extra', 'speical', 'ten-minute', 'quot', 'dress-up', 'quot', 'montage', 'also', 'alot', 'faster', 'first', 'installment', 'sister-series', 'slumber', 'party', 'movies', 'only', 'shorter', 'two', 'minutes', '75', 'minutes', 'together', 'lt', 'gt', 'also', 'scares', 'suspense', 'first', 'quot', 'Slumber', 'Party', 'Massacre', 'quot', 'movie', 'What', 'scares', 'however', 'up', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'not', 'completely', 'bad', 'conversation', 'scripture', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'quot', 'Halloween', 'quot', 'dream', 'sequence', 'begining', 'pretty', 'neat', 'not', 'exactly', 'great', 'scary', 'movie', 'not', 'even', '80', 'slasher', 'pic', 'can', 'only', 'reluctantly', 'reccomend', 'suggest', 'seeing', 'much', 'more', 'supierior', 'quot', 'House', 'Sorority', 'Row', 'quot', 'instead']",Sorority House Massacre
