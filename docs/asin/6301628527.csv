258936,A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z,6301628527,Annie Van Auken,"[6, 6]","In the most disturbing drama based on Andr&eacute; Brink's novelA DRY WHITE SEASON, Donald Sutherand stars as a South African high school history teacher. Susan Sarandon is a British newspaperwoman working in that country. Marlon Brando has a minor role as an attorney who, for Sutherland's sake, takes the government and police to court, presents overwhelming evidence of massive abuse by authorities but loses the case.The story opens with a protest in Soweto in which children as young as 10 participate. When the crowd of peaceful but vociferous sign-holding demonstrators refuse to disperse, a militia-like police force fires tear gas cannisters among them. These are picked up and thrown back at the cops who respond with indiscriminate rifle fire. Many are killed including several youngsters at the front of the crowd.Sutherland gets involved when he learns that the son of his gardener of 15 years is among the many missing. Eventually they're told the boy has died and is already buried. The father never gets the body back.Thus begins a string of atrocities perpetrated by one brutal police captain, played by J&uuml;rgen Prochnow. Sutherland, Sarandon and Stanley (Zakes Mokae), their native contact in Soweto gather affidavits from victims tortured by police and try to find a way to get these papers  out of the country and to the media.The teacher pays dearly for his activism. He's fired for being a traitor to whites, his wife and daughter leave him and the girl actually betrays him twice, resulting first in the bombing of his garage and then in something far worse. The story ends unresolved, as in 1989 the struggle against the exploitative injustice of apartheid was still ongoing.The outrage I felt at witnessing reenactments of so many crimes committed by Afrikaaners upon their native countrymen, women and children stayed with me long after the credits finished rolling. By all means, see A DRY WHITE SEASON, but be prepared to come away from this experience equally revolted and angered.",5,Apartheid tragedies,1301011200,"03 25, 2011",2011,2014,"['most', 'disturbing', 'drama', 'based', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'Brink', 'novelA', 'DRY', 'WHITE', 'SEASON', 'Donald', 'Sutherand', 'South', 'African', 'high', 'school', 'history', 'teacher', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'British', 'newspaperwoman', 'working', 'country', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'minor', 'role', 'attorney', 'who', 'Sutherland', 'sake', 'government', 'police', 'court', 'presents', 'overwhelming', 'evidence', 'massive', 'abuse', 'authorities', 'case.The', 'story', 'protest', 'Soweto', 'children', 'as', 'young', '10', 'participate', 'When', 'crowd', 'peaceful', 'vociferous', 'sign-holding', 'demonstrators', 'refuse', 'disperse', 'militia-like', 'police', 'force', 'fires', 'tear', 'gas', 'cannisters', 'are', 'picked', 'thrown', 'back', 'cops', 'who', 'respond', 'indiscriminate', 'rifle', 'fire', 'Many', 'are', 'killed', 'including', 'several', 'youngsters', 'front', 'crowd.Sutherland', 'involved', 'when', 'son', 'gardener', '15', 'years', 'many', 'missing', 'Eventually', ""'re"", 'told', 'boy', 'died', 'already', 'buried', 'father', 'never', 'body', 'back.Thus', 'string', 'atrocities', 'perpetrated', 'one', 'brutal', 'police', 'captain', 'played', 'J', 'uuml', 'rgen', 'Prochnow', 'Sutherland', 'Sarandon', 'Stanley', 'Zakes', 'Mokae', 'native', 'contact', 'Soweto', 'affidavits', 'victims', 'tortured', 'police', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'papers', 'country', 'media.The', 'teacher', 'dearly', 'activism', 'fired', 'being', 'traitor', 'whites', 'wife', 'daughter', 'leave', 'girl', 'actually', 'twice', 'resulting', 'first', 'bombing', 'garage', 'then', 'something', 'far', 'worse', 'story', 'unresolved', '1989', 'struggle', 'exploitative', 'injustice', 'apartheid', 'was', 'still', 'ongoing.The', 'outrage', 'felt', 'witnessing', 'reenactments', 'so', 'many', 'crimes', 'committed', 'Afrikaaners', 'native', 'countrymen', 'women', 'children', 'stayed', 'long', 'credits', 'finished', 'rolling', 'means', 'see', 'DRY', 'WHITE', 'SEASON', 'be', 'prepared', 'come', 'away', 'experience', 'equally', 'revolted', 'angered']",N/A

Understandably, it's a very sad story but a story of bravery, courage, and justice. Not surprisingly, the acting is real good, but I won't nod that comment to Susan Sarandon. Donald Sutherland once again pulls off another Ordinary People performance and is largely the reason why A Dry White Season can benefit from an actor like him. Even more so, it's the story that takes place which makes A Dry White Season a compelling film to watch. Marlon Brando does enough but nothing that merits anything special. He may have been overacting. I didn't know this before as I looked up information on the director Euzhan Palcy, and it turned out that the director is a black woman. It's a remarkable achievement, indeed. Not only that, she is actually the first black female to direct a major Hollywood picture. J&uuml;rgen Prochnow, renowned for his work during Das Boot, gives a great villainous performance through A Dry White Season, and it's quite easy to hate him. It may be the only film I've seen that takes on South Africa's issue of apartheid, which means segregation. Certainly the approach taken by people in A Dry White Season is entirely similar to what the Nazis did with the Jewish in Germany and elsewhere. I could feel the chilling efficacy imposed on black race living in South Africa.

258939,A2HBRINA3F9YHV,6301628527,Doctor Trance,"[25, 25]","Susan Surandon's cynical remark to Donald Sutherland, indicating that although he's lived all his life in South Africa, he was oblivoius to the brutality surrounding his normal family life.  Schoolteacher Meneer Du Toit literally loses everything in his struggle to bring justice to those responsible for the deaths of his gardener and his gardener's son.  Feeling guilty after taking his gardener's son's death a little too lightly, he is immediately swept up in the chaotic world of corruption and bloody cover-ups, after seeing the body of his badly beaten and tortured friend of 15 years.The movie is full of gripping scenes and holds nothing back, with brutal slayings of children, torture scenes, and a disturbing view into a hospital mortuary.  The film is primarily rated R for these violent images.Marlon Brando, although appearing for maybe 15-20 minutes of the film, really takes over in his scenes, as slick barrister, Ian MacKenzie.  Even though his courtroom battle is futile, he certainly gets in his licks.  He played his character to a tee, and definitely deserved the Oscar nomination, despite the controversy that year, over his limited screen time.I was much younger when I first rented the film around 1990, and it hits me harder today than it did back then.  It's a well acted film, and a powerful one,  Donald Sutherland gives and incredible perfomance and a particularly moving scene in the film is when he is in tears on the phone, speaking to his daughter, after finally realizing she has betrayed him.  Except for his son, most of his family, friends, and colleagues do not wish to associate with him after the path his as chosen in fighting a losing battle against corruption.  A top notch film about a man willing to give up everything, in pursuit of truth and justice over the wrongful death of a friend.

I admit that checking out his movies has been an up and down journey.  However, his relatively brief appearance in ""A Dry White Season"" is a reminder as to why I persist.  He steals the show in a film that is more focussed on shocking us than informing us.  I must admit that the hopelessness of the racial and financial divide between White and Black in South Africa seemed to necessarily be overstated.  That is  until I remembered reading Coetzee's ""The Age of Iron"" and experiencing the same scenarios.  It is all very disturbing although I'm still not sure if this is a depiction of how things were or how things still are.Other than Brando, much of the rest of the acting is somewhat weak.  The essence of the film is the shock and the suspense.  I hung on to review the cast and credits and my eyes couldn't believe what I saw.
