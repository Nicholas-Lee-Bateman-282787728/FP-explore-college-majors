Erland,"[0, 0]","Note: Requires multi-region player to view in the America's.Mythic tale of what life might have been like for the inhabitants of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) long before the coming of the white man. 'Rapa Nui' means, ""navel of the world,"" a concept found at the basis of every archaic, shamanistic based society. Rapa Nui is a tale of young love fighting against the political, religious and social constraints of life at ""the center."" Noro (Jason Scott Lee) is a long-ear, a member of the tribal upper class and the Grandson of the tribal chief. He is in love with Ramana (Sandrine Holt), a short-ear and member of the lower class of laborers responsible for the carving of the monolithic statues required by the religious elite.The chief agrees to let his grandson break the taboo and marry his true love if he enters and wins a yearly intertribal competition which would bestow upon the chief the coveted ""Birdman' title for the eighteenth time. It's a dangerous endeavor and he would be competing against many who would do whatever it takes to win. He will also be competing against Make (Esai Morales) his childhood friend who must win, or die. He agrees to his Grandfather's conditions and enters the race. Thus the adventure begins.While the great day of competition approaches the aging, mentally degenerating chief dreams of a destiny of sailing away on the great white spirit canoe to the ""Home of the Gods."" When a giant iceberg appears in the bay at the very moment the competition ends he believes his day has arrived and has his warriors canoe him out to the ice block. As he floats away to his death he calls out to those who refused to join him, ""What did you think salvation would look like?Wonderful movie that is virtually unknown in the U.S.A. 'Rapa Nui' has a great cast: Jason Lee Scott, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe), Esai Morales, Anzac Wallace (Utu), Rena Owen (Once Were Warriors) and Cliff Curtis (Whale Rider and Once Were Warriors) are all accomplished actors who have specialized in roles dealing with indigenous cultures.",5,"""What Did You Think Salvation Would Look Like?"" ~ Tale From The Navel Of The World",1199750400,"01 8, 2008",2008,2045,"['Note', 'multi-region', 'player', 'view', ""America's.Mythic"", 'tale', 'what', 'life', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'inhabitants', 'Rapa', 'Nui', 'Easter', 'Island', 'long', 'coming', 'white', 'man', 'Nui', 'means', 'navel', 'world', 'concept', 'found', 'basis', 'archaic', 'shamanistic', 'based', 'society', 'Rapa', 'Nui', 'tale', 'young', 'love', 'fighting', 'political', 'religious', 'social', 'constraints', 'life', 'center', 'Noro', 'Jason', 'Scott', 'Lee', 'long-ear', 'member', 'tribal', 'upper', 'class', 'Grandson', 'tribal', 'chief', 'love', 'Ramana', 'Sandrine', 'Holt', 'short-ear', 'member', 'lower', 'class', 'laborers', 'responsible', 'carving', 'monolithic', 'statues', 'required', 'religious', 'elite.The', 'chief', 'let', 'grandson', 'break', 'taboo', 'marry', 'true', 'love', 'yearly', 'intertribal', 'competition', 'would', 'bestow', 'chief', 'coveted', 'Birdman', 'title', 'eighteenth', 'time', 'dangerous', 'endeavor', 'would', 'be', 'competing', 'many', 'who', 'would', 'do', 'whatever', 'win', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'competing', 'Make', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'childhood', 'friend', 'who', 'must', 'win', 'die', 'Grandfather', 'conditions', 'race', 'Thus', 'adventure', 'great', 'day', 'competition', 'aging', 'mentally', 'degenerating', 'chief', 'dreams', 'destiny', 'sailing', 'away', 'great', 'white', 'spirit', 'canoe', 'Home', 'Gods', 'When', 'giant', 'iceberg', 'bay', 'very', 'moment', 'competition', 'day', 'arrived', 'warriors', 'canoe', 'ice', 'block', 'away', 'death', 'out', 'who', 'refused', 'join', 'What', 'did', 'think', 'salvation', 'would', 'look', 'Wonderful', 'movie', 'virtually', 'unknown', 'U.S.A.', ""'Rapa"", 'Nui', 'great', 'cast', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'Scott', 'Sandrine', 'Holt', 'Black', 'Robe', 'Esai', 'Morales', 'Anzac', 'Wallace', 'Utu', 'Rena', 'Owen', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'Cliff', 'Curtis', 'Whale', 'Rider', 'Once', 'Were', 'Warriors', 'are', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'specialized', 'roles', 'dealing', 'indigenous', 'cultures']",N/A

562075,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,B00004ZCVC,Fernando,"[0, 0]","Right off the bat: this movie is a severely under-rated gem. It combines a great fictional story with real historical accounts (such as the Birdman competition) flavored with Rapa Nui mythology and culture. In between layers and subplots of greed, power struggles and environmentalism. Rapa Nui is a timeless story and one which reminds us that, in any time and place, we are all the same and subject to the same self-created perils.The only problem is that, since the movie tanked in the US, the only DVD's available are made in Korea and the quality of the film makes it look almost like 1970's footage. It's like watching Star Wars in black and white. The original gorgeous cinematography is lost and the entire movie seems like it was shot under overcast weather (which it wasn't). A shame, part of the appeal of this movie was the lushness of the disappearing green and the sea and sky.It is sad that Rapa Nui never got the success and recognition it deserved, it's obvious the writers and creative staff poured their hearts and souls into making it. Sad that its cast (with Jason Scott Lee and Esai Morales playing wonderful leads) didn't get a career bump out of it and that this movie was abandoned by the studio. Thanks for the Korean company for keeping it alive in DVD form but at this point you are better off getting it through instant video from Amazon.

Its about now a people destroy themselves by using up their natural resources and destroying their environment. A problem that humans seem unable to correct to this very day.There is a also a love story and the race to become the tribe who wins the birdman competition. For winning the tribe's leader will control all the other tribes on Easter Island.This is one of those films that should have gotten alot more attention when it came out but I don't believe it did. And that's a shame because I think its quite good. Their is a little topless nudity but it's not done in a disrespectful way.
