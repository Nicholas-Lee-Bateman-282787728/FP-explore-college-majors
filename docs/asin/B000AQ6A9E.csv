931070,AHY9EY9HGQTP6,B000AQ6A9E,Andrew Freborg,"[634, 659]","I am reposting a review, as my previous review was deleted - AMAZON must use the same censors as TNT. This is NOT the same version seen on TV -- much has been removed to facilitate ""classroom viewing."" The TYPICAL practice is to included ADDITIONAL footage in a DVD release because the DVD doesn't have to cater to TV advertising time and audiences with short attention spans. The DVD customer wants a good film - didn't TNT ever hear of ""Extended Versions?"" Not only does this DVD NOT contain additional footage - footage aired in the original TNT TV broadcast has been censored. Its even more choppy than the TV version! Gone is Sitting Bull's sundance prior to the Little Bighorn - with associated deep native perspectives. The Wounded Knee footage is also heavily edited from the much more powerful version shown on TNT. Sanitized. The stark slaughter of the fleeing innocents - and hodgekiss guns - are gone. Instead we are left with the endless and boring side stories of Wheeler peripherals. The ""extra footage"" CD is also a waste -- a lot of pontificating from actors, and the music video. Would have much prefered an extended version - geared to an adult audience interested in solid history - not this mishmash of mini vignettes. Additional scenes to better tie the story together - and non-santitized TRUTH. History is too important. This is a heavily edited, sanitized, and choppy film - with a cheesy CD extra with a silly video. Would have prefered the real soundtrack and something with Joseph Marshall narrating. His narration in the film is one of the few good things, along with location shooting.",1,Sanitized Vignettes - NOT the same version shown on TV,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,1615,"['am', 'reposting', 'review', 'previous', 'review', 'was', 'deleted', 'AMAZON', 'must', 'use', 'same', 'censors', 'TNT', 'NOT', 'same', 'version', 'seen', 'TV', 'much', 'been', 'removed', 'facilitate', 'classroom', 'viewing', 'TYPICAL', 'practice', 'included', 'ADDITIONAL', 'footage', 'DVD', 'release', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'cater', 'TV', 'advertising', 'time', 'audiences', 'short', 'attention', 'spans', 'DVD', 'customer', 'good', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'TNT', 'ever', 'hear', 'Extended', 'Versions', 'Not', 'only', 'DVD', 'NOT', 'contain', 'additional', 'footage', 'footage', 'aired', 'original', 'TNT', 'TV', 'broadcast', 'been', 'censored', 'even', 'more', 'choppy', 'TV', 'version', 'Gone', 'Sitting', 'Bull', 'sundance', 'prior', 'Little', 'Bighorn', 'associated', 'deep', 'native', 'perspectives', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'footage', 'also', 'heavily', 'edited', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'version', 'shown', 'TNT', 'Sanitized', 'stark', 'slaughter', 'fleeing', 'innocents', 'hodgekiss', 'guns', 'are', 'gone', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'endless', 'boring', 'side', 'stories', 'Wheeler', 'peripherals', 'extra', 'footage', 'CD', 'also', 'waste', 'lot', 'pontificating', 'actors', 'music', 'video', 'Would', 'have', 'much', 'prefered', 'extended', 'version', 'geared', 'adult', 'audience', 'interested', 'solid', 'history', 'not', 'mishmash', 'mini', 'vignettes', 'Additional', 'scenes', 'better', 'tie', 'story', 'together', 'non-santitized', 'TRUTH', 'History', 'too', 'important', 'heavily', 'edited', 'sanitized', 'choppy', 'film', 'cheesy', 'CD', 'extra', 'silly', 'video', 'Would', 'have', 'prefered', 'real', 'soundtrack', 'something', 'Joseph', 'Marshall', 'narrating', 'narration', 'film', 'one', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'location', 'shooting']",N/A

At times it is touching and heart warming, but at other times it is a veritable trial to behold.  The over-all impact is haunting and sad in it's reality, and yet at the same time it will leave you with a renewed sense of gratitude for the time in which you live and the comfortable life you lead.It's true that the story touches only briefly on the lives of some people who could be the main characters of their own mini series, leaving us wondering where their paths lead them, but I think that Spielberg's intent was to tell the story with a wide angle lens encompassing more time, space, and people instead of a zoom focusing on two or three stories.Personally, I think it works well, and adds to the feeling of curiosity, mystery, and unknown that surrounded much of the early west. Many people who lived at that time had relatives who left home in search of adventure and fortune and were never heard from again... and this series gives us a taste of how they must have felt.Please, watch this series.

931086,A22J9WI2PDAVJ,B000AQ6A9E,Don D. Basina,"[22, 28]","""Into the West (2005)"" is made for television mini-series that aired on TNT (DreamWorks Television) for six weeks. Each episode was two hour in length. This epic film takes place in the 1800's emerging Western Territories. The monumental task for filming fell on six different directors for each two hour segment. There were eight producers including Executive Producer Steven Spielberg.The main scriptwriter was William Mastrosimone. He had three other scriptwriters take some of the duties to bring these six episodes together. The flow and main overall scene theme was well maintained between the directors. The script writing was well written for that era. The actors did pull off the dialogue and dialect. The Lakota language was spoken true to form for the non Lakota members and a big thank you should go to the language instructor.The scene transitions from each week are difficult to catch up because of the passage of time that was used and not explained. Also, with the accumulation of age for the actors, it is hard to distinguish who is who. Some of the main characters change actors so their look is different and offspring of the main family is hard to keep track of. Hopefully the forthcoming DVD will make this transition smoother. The use of the subtitles for the Lakota language gives the film authenticity to the difficulties of the language barrier during that time.The use of Native American actors and behind the scenes personnel gives this film some creditability within the Native American community. The tendency in the past for Hollywood seems to bypass input from any Native American Tribe to get the real historical story. Hopefully this film stops that trend.The mini-series follows two families, the Wheeler family and members of the Lakota tribe. The mini-series takes a multi-generation view into their struggles, triumphs and historical significance for each family. The points of view of family members are followed as they explore the Western Territories searching for a better life. From the gold rush, cross country railroad, ethnic diversity, Native perspective and use of Lakota language, the directors tried to be as accurate and detailed in authenticity. Of course there are going to be some inaccuracies made, but overall the film depicts the true hardships, cruelty of the time. Can you call it a Native American only film? No. But the film tries to give a history lesson from two perspectives which I think it accomplishes.The one star drawback is that it tries to cover too much historical events in one film. And cannot give the true depiction needed. Sometimes it seems like it was a second thought on the significant relationship with the main characters.

931095,A3P98J5DZ00A75,B000AQ6A9E,"Ken Roberts ""social historian""","[12, 21]","(note - I did not see the original when broadcasted on TV, so I can only review this ""edited"" version).Into the West is both excellent and poor at the same time. For what it covers in detail during the 19th century, it is commendable. The expansion of our nation westward was such a major undertaking for those who were a part of that time - just as scary as those who left their homelands on the other side of the Atlantic to come to the New World.This set shows the harrowing experiences of the travelers pretty accurately: fighting the weather (no, it wasn't always bright and sunny on the wagon trail), death from accidents and disease - the horrible scenes of an amputation is as real as it gets, as well as the length of time it took to move the long distance, which created high tensions between the folks. Previous movies of westward expansion rarely, if ever, show this.The series also shows the atrocities the American government bestowed upon the Indian. The blatant lies, and purposeful obliteration of the tribes, the prejudices toward the Indian race. And the constant movement of whole villages of the natives for the various reasoning given at the time (can anybody say ""poletown?"" Google it to see what I mean).And, as far as I can tell, the truly heartbreaking massacre at Wounded knee - a true low point in American history if there ever was one.Now comes my disappointments in this set.Similar to Dances With Wolves, Into The West's other purpose seems to be to make the white race as a whole out to be a bunch of evil devils. Throughout this movie whites are dogged - even by their own in many cases. It shows whites killing Indians out of fear constantly, but does it show the reverse - Indians killing whites for the same reasons? Very little. And when it is showed, it's shown in a manner where the viewer can accept the reasoning behind the murders. Did you not feel the young bugler's death was honored and justified? Did you not feel pride for the young Indian boy when he killed him, then did not scalp him because the bugler fought bravely? That was sickening!There is another scene where Margaret tells the Cheyenne Chief what the magic box is - ""camera."" How is the response? The chief comments on the language the white race uses, how it is not as ""musical"" as the Indian tongue. What is that? Blatant racism, if you ask me. Putting down a race because of their English language?Into the West also rarely shows most white families as close-knit, instead showing constantly fighting amongst themselves - even killing each other. Of course, if one took this movie as absolute truth, one would think the Indians never fought or killed each other. They only lived in peace.Truth be known, they fought and killed every bit as much as any other race. Of course, it is not politically correct to say that, but to believe otherwise is not accepting the whole truth.Oh, and by the way, the tribes were very protective of ""their land"" as well. This set shows that in an inconspicuous manner, but it's there.Killing, war, hatred, rape, all happened in all races.While watching this set I have pointed out the fabrications on both sides of the fence, how this set can never truly be considered THE TRUTH because of the political correctness.I am still waiting for the day when the whole honest truth is shown. It's written that this version is for classroom use. The poor white kids, unfortunately, will leave believing their race is the scourge of the nation. And that is as big of a shame as any form of racism out there.(Postscript: To the reviewer who made a personal attack on me for my review - I have done my research, and I will not accept what you insist as being ""fact"" because you insist it's so. I have read many many books and articles about the plight of the American Indian as well as the hardships and murder of the white settlers. There are two sides to every story. And that IS a fact. Re-read my review...did I not speak of the attrocities the U.S. government bestowed upon the Indians? I simply stated that this series, instead of showing facts on all sides, was a one-sided anti-European piece of politically correct propoganda that is being peddled to school aged kids as being historically accurate. And, yes, that is racism. Or do you believe that racism is a one street with white folks at one end and all other races at the other?)",3,May the Whole Truth Be Told,1136592000,"01 7, 2006",2006,4377,"['note', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'original', 'when', 'broadcasted', 'TV', 'can', 'only', 'review', 'edited', 'version', 'West', 'excellent', 'poor', 'same', 'time', 'what', 'detail', '19th', 'century', 'commendable', 'expansion', 'nation', 'westward', 'was', 'major', 'undertaking', 'who', 'were', 'part', 'time', 'just', 'as', 'scary', 'who', 'left', 'homelands', 'other', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'come', 'New', 'World.This', 'set', 'harrowing', 'experiences', 'travelers', 'pretty', 'accurately', 'fighting', 'weather', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'bright', 'sunny', 'wagon', 'trail', 'death', 'accidents', 'disease', 'horrible', 'scenes', 'amputation', 'as', 'real', 'as', 'well', 'length', 'time', 'took', 'move', 'long', 'distance', 'created', 'high', 'tensions', 'folks', 'Previous', 'movies', 'westward', 'expansion', 'rarely', 'ever', 'show', 'this.The', 'series', 'also', 'atrocities', 'American', 'government', 'bestowed', 'Indian', 'blatant', 'purposeful', 'obliteration', 'tribes', 'prejudices', 'Indian', 'race', 'constant', 'movement', 'whole', 'villages', 'natives', 'various', 'reasoning', 'given', 'time', 'can', 'anybody', 'say', 'poletown', 'see', 'what', 'mean', '.And', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'tell', 'truly', 'heartbreaking', 'massacre', 'Wounded', 'knee', 'true', 'low', 'point', 'American', 'history', 'ever', 'was', 'one.Now', 'disappointments', 'set.Similar', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Into', 'West', 'other', 'purpose', 'be', 'make', 'white', 'race', 'whole', 'be', 'bunch', 'evil', 'devils', 'movie', 'whites', 'are', 'dogged', 'even', 'own', 'many', 'cases', 'whites', 'killing', 'Indians', 'fear', 'constantly', 'show', 'reverse', 'Indians', 'killing', 'whites', 'same', 'reasons', 'Very', 'little', 'when', 'showed', 'shown', 'manner', 'where', 'viewer', 'can', 'accept', 'reasoning', 'murders', 'Did', 'not', 'feel', 'young', 'bugler', 'death', 'was', 'honored', 'justified', 'Did', 'not', 'feel', 'pride', 'young', 'Indian', 'boy', 'when', 'killed', 'then', 'did', 'not', 'scalp', 'bugler', 'fought', 'bravely', 'was', 'sickening', 'scene', 'where', 'Margaret', 'Cheyenne', 'Chief', 'what', 'magic', 'box', 'camera', 'How', 'response', 'chief', 'comments', 'language', 'white', 'race', 'uses', 'how', 'not', 'musical', 'Indian', 'tongue', 'What', 'Blatant', 'racism', 'ask', 'Putting', 'down', 'race', 'English', 'language', 'West', 'also', 'rarely', 'most', 'white', 'families', 'close-knit', 'instead', 'showing', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'amongst', 'even', 'killing', 'other', 'course', 'one', 'took', 'movie', 'absolute', 'truth', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Indians', 'never', 'fought', 'killed', 'other', 'only', 'lived', 'peace.Truth', 'be', 'known', 'fought', 'killed', 'bit', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'race', 'course', 'not', 'politically', 'correct', 'say', 'believe', 'otherwise', 'not', 'accepting', 'whole', 'truth.Oh', 'way', 'tribes', 'were', 'very', 'protective', 'land', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'inconspicuous', 'manner', 'there.Killing', 'war', 'hatred', 'rape', 'happened', 'races.While', 'watching', 'set', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'fabrications', 'sides', 'fence', 'how', 'set', 'can', 'never', 'truly', 'be', 'considered', 'TRUTH', 'political', 'correctness.I', 'am', 'still', 'waiting', 'day', 'when', 'whole', 'honest', 'truth', 'shown', 'written', 'version', 'classroom', 'use', 'poor', 'white', 'kids', 'unfortunately', 'will', 'leave', 'believing', 'race', 'scourge', 'nation', 'as', 'big', 'shame', 'form', 'racism', 'there', 'Postscript', 'reviewer', 'who', 'made', 'personal', 'attack', 'review', 'have', 'done', 'research', 'will', 'not', 'accept', 'what', 'insist', 'being', 'fact', 'insist', 'so', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'many', 'books', 'articles', 'plight', 'American', 'Indian', 'as', 'well', 'hardships', 'murder', 'white', 'settlers', 'are', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'fact', 'Re-read', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'speak', 'attrocities', 'U.S.', 'government', 'bestowed', 'Indians', 'simply', 'stated', 'series', 'instead', 'showing', 'facts', 'sides', 'was', 'one-sided', 'anti-European', 'piece', 'politically', 'correct', 'propoganda', 'being', 'peddled', 'school', 'aged', 'kids', 'being', 'historically', 'accurate', 'yes', 'racism', 'do', 'believe', 'racism', 'one', 'street', 'white', 'folks', 'one', 'end', 'other', 'races', 'other']",N/A

Perhaps having the same actors portray the character with aging makeup would have tied the story together easier. Or telling their stories more deeply and profoundly would have served to leave a deeper impression, make more than a superficial impact in skimming lightly over history. I love the fact that film or television shows are even being made, that attempt to shed light on inclusive human history and honouring the treaties ... I often wonder about the historical cultural backgrounds of the writers, when I watch certain portraits being painted on the cinema screen. There is no complaint, but undue expectation on my part - that we are more and our ancestor's stories are more ... than what comes across in the stories told to date. Perhaps the people whose ancestors have lived on these lands for centuries should take up the pen, as it is mightier than the sword, to share their heart felt truths of their family's generational wisdom stories. I do recommend people to watch this series, but supplement this viewing with First Nations poetry, songs, and wisdom tales to balance out the experience. We all get to live in the present, and honour our ancestors, however we choose.

Schweitzer ""zohoe""","[5, 5]","TNT's ""Into the West"" mini-series is one of the best retellings of the period of western expansion in 19th century America.  It is unique in that it presents the familiar story of the West as told largely through the eyes of the American Indians whose story is too often omitted or given only passing attention.  It attempts to finally present the true history of the West by following the lives of two families, one white and one Indian, as they are witness to the great events that shape what would become the mythic West.  In the process, we see much of the tragedy that befell the Indians as, over the course of the century, they were reduced to poverty, starvation, and death.""Into the West"" is comprised of 6 episodes, each following the two families from generation to generation and though many details are omitted from such a sweeping tale, it hits on some of the important events that shaped the West and the ultimate fate of the Indians:  The opening of the West to settlement by the Mountain Men, the wagon trains across the plains, the building of the transcontinental railroad, etc.  What it does best is to finally portray the true story of the interaction and eventual overwhelming of the Indians as the tide of white settlement washes over their land and obliterates their culture.  It also shows, in great detail, the tragic events which are too often whitewashed in our history, such as the bloody massacres at Sand Creek and Wounded Knee.No story of this magnitude can include everything and I think, even without the edited scenes mentioned by others, this mini-series is powerful and well-made.  It tells a story that has been left untold for too long and gives an excellent glimpse into the true history of the West.",5,A True History Lesson,1188518400,"08 31, 2007",2007,1739,"['TNT', 'Into', 'West', 'mini-series', 'one', 'best', 'retellings', 'period', 'western', 'expansion', '19th', 'century', 'America', 'unique', 'familiar', 'story', 'West', 'told', 'largely', 'eyes', 'American', 'Indians', 'story', 'too', 'often', 'omitted', 'given', 'only', 'passing', 'attention', 'finally', 'present', 'true', 'history', 'West', 'following', 'lives', 'two', 'families', 'one', 'white', 'one', 'Indian', 'are', 'witness', 'great', 'events', 'shape', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'mythic', 'West', 'process', 'see', 'much', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'Indians', 'course', 'century', 'were', 'reduced', 'poverty', 'starvation', 'death', 'West', 'comprised', '6', 'episodes', 'following', 'two', 'families', 'generation', 'generation', 'many', 'details', 'are', 'omitted', 'such', 'sweeping', 'tale', 'important', 'events', 'shaped', 'West', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'Indians', 'opening', 'West', 'settlement', 'Mountain', 'Men', 'wagon', 'trains', 'plains', 'building', 'transcontinental', 'railroad', 'etc', 'What', 'best', 'finally', 'portray', 'true', 'story', 'interaction', 'eventual', 'overwhelming', 'Indians', 'tide', 'white', 'settlement', 'washes', 'land', 'culture', 'also', 'great', 'detail', 'tragic', 'events', 'are', 'too', 'often', 'whitewashed', 'history', 'such', 'bloody', 'Sand', 'Creek', 'Wounded', 'Knee.No', 'story', 'magnitude', 'can', 'include', 'everything', 'think', 'even', 'edited', 'scenes', 'mentioned', 'others', 'mini-series', 'powerful', 'well-made', 'story', 'been', 'left', 'untold', 'too', 'long', 'excellent', 'glimpse', 'true', 'history', 'West']",N/A

931105,A1OCVWN4K4Q3FN,B000AQ6A9E,M. Keogh,"[17, 36]","""Into the West"" was TNT's much hyped attempt to revive the genre of the historical mini-series.  It's goal was to join the pantheon of its well-loved and critically acclaimed predecessors: Roots, Centennial, The Awakening Land, and Lonesome Dove, as one of the great TV events.  ""Into the West"" had the budget and the huge cast of known actors to pull off this attempt.  However, ""Into the West"" falls well short of greatness and, in fact, it barely rises above the level of mediocrity.The biggest weakness of ""Into the West"" is its script which an absolute mess.  Characters come and go with no continuity- Sean Astin's character?  Plot strings just fizzle out- Keri Russell's being taken captive by the Cheyennes?  And a lot of just plain dumb plot events- why does Matthew Settle character decide not to go to California after he is hurt?  ""Into the West's"" script was the product of screenwriters pulling their story out of thin air- it's not based on anything.  Unlike Lonesome Dove, Centennial, and The Awakening Land which were based on the works of some of America's most famous novelists, Larry McMurtry, James Michener, and Conrad Richter, ""Into the West's"" script was the creation of a group project that seems to have been slapped together in order to meet deadlines.  The end result is a miniseries that is all over the place with none of the characters or plots being truly developed.I won't bother too much discussing the historical failings of this film which are rampant.  It's was made as a work of popular entertainment, not as a history lesson.  That being said- even if you have just a basic knowledge of history you're going to be shaking your head at some of the historical stretchers told in this one.Finally, we get to its the portrayal of the American Indian.  The Lakota's and Cheyennes are shown as group of peaceful environmentalists who don't have an aggressive bone in their bodies.  If they react violently to anything- well, they always have a great excuse- the Cheyennes wipe out a wagon train because they fear that the settlers will bring smallpox.  The ""innocent"" Lakotas are shown being unfairly attacked by other tribes with whom they are competing for buffalo- lets ignore that the Lakotas were an highly expantionist lot who took their lands from weaker tribes.  ""Into the West"" also seems to have adopted a stance that murder, kidnap, and rape are fine as long as their done by American Indians- the incomplete Keri Russell plot.  As I said, I don't want to dwell too much historical accuracy or a lack thereof, but I will state that portraying the tribes of the Great Plains as new age Eagle scouts with a bent for ecology is as historically inaccurate and dishonest as the old ""me scalp'um, paleface"" portrayal of the American Indian found in old western movies.  Some have praised ""Into the West's"" rejection of the old myth of the American Indians as mindless savages, but that ignores that it just replaced the old myth with another which is just as false.I am being pretty tough on this miniseries because it's just not that good.

931106,A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,B000AQ6A9E,M. Newton,"[10, 11]","""Into the West"" is a fine quality piece of work.  The costumes, sets, quality of the photography, actors, and real historical settings make this a 1st quality production.  Unfortunately, the storyline meaders and wanders and never delivers a punch at the end.  This film has some very good scenes, but a collection of good scenes does not a great saga make.  I would compare the feeling I got from this movie to how one might feel after watching 6 great documentaries on the History Channel.  While all 6 might be excellent documentaries, by the 5th or 6th you're probably getting a little tired of so many documentaries on the same subject without a major climax for which to look forward.A number of outstanding actors give good performances, but unfortunately the viewer doesn't really get to actually know many of them.  All too often, we see someone for a few good scenes, but then they either get killed or they simply disappear from the camera and we never see them again.While there is some decent action, via battles and individual conflicts, we never get a major focal point for the film.  Looking back at the film from the end, I have to admit that I often can't remember which scenes were from which battle.""Centennial"" was an excellent miniseries that is very similar to this one.  ""Centennial"" wins out over this because ""Centennial"" actually had a plot and a climax.  There was a reason to watch the entire program.  With ""Into the West"" you could easily watch any of the six movies and not really feel like you missed much.I really don't want to be too hard on this film, because I did enjoy it overall and I'm glad I watched it.  Unfortunately, I had to force myself to watch the last 2 episodes because I was really getting tired of it.  If you have an interest in historical epics, it's probably worth you time to watch this.  After the first 2 episodes, you may be wondering why it didn't get better reviews; but by the 5th or 6th episodes, you'll probably be in agreement that this was a decent project, but in the end it goes out without a bang.",3,"Quality Film, but lacks a Punch",1130112000,"10 24, 2005",2005,2067,"['West', 'fine', 'quality', 'piece', 'work', 'costumes', 'sets', 'quality', 'photography', 'actors', 'real', 'historical', 'settings', 'make', '1st', 'quality', 'production', 'Unfortunately', 'storyline', 'meaders', 'wanders', 'never', 'punch', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'scenes', 'collection', 'good', 'scenes', 'not', 'great', 'saga', 'make', 'would', 'compare', 'feeling', 'got', 'movie', 'how', 'one', 'might', 'feel', 'watching', '6', 'great', 'documentaries', 'History', 'Channel', '6', 'might', 'be', 'excellent', 'documentaries', '5th', '6th', ""'re"", 'probably', 'getting', 'little', 'tired', 'so', 'many', 'documentaries', 'same', 'subject', 'major', 'climax', 'look', 'forward.A', 'number', 'outstanding', 'actors', 'give', 'good', 'performances', 'unfortunately', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'actually', 'know', 'many', 'too', 'often', 'see', 'someone', 'few', 'good', 'scenes', 'then', 'either', 'get', 'killed', 'simply', 'disappear', 'camera', 'never', 'see', 'decent', 'action', 'battles', 'individual', 'conflicts', 'never', 'get', 'major', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'Looking', 'back', 'film', 'end', 'have', 'admit', 'often', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'scenes', 'were', 'battle', 'Centennial', 'was', 'excellent', 'miniseries', 'very', 'similar', 'one', 'Centennial', 'out', 'Centennial', 'actually', 'had', 'plot', 'climax', 'was', 'reason', 'watch', 'entire', 'program', 'Into', 'West', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'six', 'movies', 'not', 'really', 'feel', 'missed', 'much.I', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'too', 'hard', 'film', 'did', 'enjoy', 'overall', ""'m"", 'glad', 'watched', 'Unfortunately', 'had', 'force', 'watch', 'last', '2', 'episodes', 'was', 'really', 'getting', 'tired', 'have', 'interest', 'historical', 'epics', 'probably', 'worth', 'time', 'watch', 'first', '2', 'episodes', 'may', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'better', 'reviews', '5th', '6th', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'agreement', 'was', 'decent', 'project', 'end', 'out', 'bang']",N/A

The story is of two families, one Lakota and white American and their experiences of events between the 1820's and 1890.Living in England we did not have the TV show only the apparently edited DVD version. I can't but help but think that I'm about to be ripped off when the 'complete edition' is released at some point in the near future. Oh well, never mind.I was quite impressed at the beginning, but midway into the series I was getting really quite disillusioned. I think there are a number of problems. Firstly there are just too many characters and you never really get to know too much about any of them or really who they are. People come and go with alarming frequency. Secondly and perhaps most problematically is that the programme tries to cram too much into too little time. We have a very comprehensive history of the American west as it was experienced by the Northern Plains Nations and the white settlers, but little is clearly explained as to why things happened and the way they did. This disjointed approach lets down a good cast. Why were the Cheyenne survivors of Sand Creek walking away quite calmly away from their burning village? Why did the Fetterman Fight look like a small skirmish?Perhaps more problematically and politically why do we not see Native American non-combatants shot down in cold blood? What agenda, or more correctly whose is behined this. Mr Speilberg quite rightly did not hold back the horrors of the Nazi's in Schindlers List. Why should we expect differently from 'Into the West'? Another review about this film states that the Native American men in the film are portrayed (erroneously) as always having a somehow justified reason for killing and commiting rape. Point taken, but where do we see Native American women being raped by white men, far more prevalent in US history than vice versa.There are redeeming points to this film - I thought the Lakota children being sent to boarding schools was accurately painful to watch; and I also thought the despair of the reservations was covered very well as was the build up of the Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee.Mr Speilberg or anyone else who reads this I think it best for you to use greater budgets and make films that are more narrow in their focus in terms of history. It would be realtively easy to make a good 2-3 hour film about the Ghost Dance and Wounded Knee. A new film about 'Ishi' is well overdue, but perhaps one based upon the Yahi people rather than their white protagonists.Finally you don't need a film with white actors to make a film essentially about Native American people 'accessible' to non- Native American audiences.",2,Disappointing,1131926400,"11 14, 2005",2005,2676,"['Ok', 'here', 'background', 'DVD', 'story', 'two', 'families', 'one', 'Lakota', 'white', 'American', 'experiences', 'events', '1820', '1890.Living', 'England', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'TV', 'show', 'only', 'apparently', 'edited', 'DVD', 'version', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', ""'m"", 'be', 'ripped', 'off', 'when', ""'complete"", 'edition', 'released', 'point', 'near', 'future', 'Oh', 'well', 'never', 'mind.I', 'was', 'quite', 'impressed', 'beginning', 'midway', 'series', 'was', 'getting', 'really', 'quite', 'disillusioned', 'think', 'are', 'number', 'problems', 'Firstly', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'know', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'who', 'are', 'People', 'come', 'go', 'alarming', 'frequency', 'Secondly', 'perhaps', 'most', 'problematically', 'programme', 'cram', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'little', 'time', 'have', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'history', 'American', 'west', 'was', 'experienced', 'Northern', 'Plains', 'Nations', 'white', 'settlers', 'little', 'clearly', 'explained', 'why', 'things', 'happened', 'way', 'did', 'disjointed', 'approach', 'down', 'good', 'cast', 'Why', 'were', 'Cheyenne', 'survivors', 'Sand', 'Creek', 'walking', 'away', 'quite', 'calmly', 'away', 'burning', 'village', 'Why', 'did', 'Fetterman', 'Fight', 'look', 'small', 'skirmish', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'problematically', 'politically', 'why', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Native', 'American', 'non-combatants', 'shot', 'down', 'cold', 'blood', 'What', 'agenda', 'more', 'correctly', 'behined', 'Mr', 'Speilberg', 'quite', 'rightly', 'did', 'not', 'hold', 'back', 'horrors', 'Nazi', 'Schindlers', 'List', 'Why', 'should', 'expect', 'differently', 'West', 'review', 'film', 'Native', 'American', 'men', 'film', 'are', 'portrayed', 'erroneously', 'always', 'having', 'somehow', 'justified', 'reason', 'killing', 'commiting', 'rape', 'Point', 'taken', 'where', 'do', 'see', 'Native', 'American', 'women', 'being', 'raped', 'white', 'men', 'far', 'more', 'prevalent', 'US', 'history', 'vice', 'are', 'redeeming', 'points', 'film', 'thought', 'Lakota', 'children', 'being', 'sent', 'boarding', 'schools', 'was', 'accurately', 'painful', 'watch', 'also', 'thought', 'despair', 'reservations', 'was', 'covered', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'build', 'Ghost', 'Dance', 'Wounded', 'Knee.Mr', 'Speilberg', 'anyone', 'else', 'who', 'think', 'best', 'use', 'greater', 'budgets', 'make', 'films', 'are', 'more', 'narrow', 'focus', 'terms', 'history', 'would', 'be', 'realtively', 'easy', 'make', 'good', '2-3', 'hour', 'film', 'Ghost', 'Dance', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'new', 'film', ""'Ishi"", 'well', 'overdue', 'perhaps', 'one', 'based', 'Yahi', 'people', 'rather', 'white', 'protagonists.Finally', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'film', 'white', 'actors', 'make', 'film', 'essentially', 'about', 'Native', 'American', 'people', ""'accessible"", 'non-', 'Native', 'American', 'audiences']",N/A

Durham ""Big Evil""","[9, 16]","Originally aired on cable network TNT and featuring Steven Spielberg as an executive producer, Into the West isn't the ultra, sweeping epic that it tries valiantly to be, but it's a rousing docu-drama spanning the years of young Jacob Wheeler (Matthew Settle) who yearns to travel to the West to make his own name for himself.  Eventually his brothers (including Skeet Ulrich and Firefly and Serenity's Alan Tudyk) journey with him and after him, and suffer their own fates as well.  What seems to be the show's main focus, the uneasy bond between the white man and the Native Americans, shares the majority of the mini-series with the Wheeler family's saga, but it's an uneasy balance that doesn't always work.  That aside, the direction and cinematography are breathtaking, and the massive cast (including Josh Brolin, Gary Busey, Will Patton, Simon Baker, Angel's Christian Kane, Keri Russell, Rachel Leigh Cook, Daniel Gillies, Beau Bridges, Balthazar Getty, Lord of the Rings' Sean Astin, Graham Greene, Lance Henriksen, Matthew Modine, Tom Berenger, David Paymer, Craig Sheffer, Keith Carradine, Joanna Going, and Wes Studi) make Into the West worth seeing.

Each episode runs approx. 90 minutes, and feels like its own movie. The scale, and attention to detail and drama is that good. I feel its especially wonderful that such a emmense job was done on this series, because alot about this period of our history is starting to be forgotten. People seem to think we defeated the british (twice), fought a civil war and then world war I happened. So its appropriate that this series exists and has been done with such love and respect.It is easily on par with HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" and ""From the Earth to the Moon"", each there own masterpieces about our history. This series, ""Into the West"", follows the first bands of hunters and frontiersmen as they sought to find there way to the Pacific ocean and find California. Settling the west had its challenges, and the series does a magnificent job of showing each of them for what they were. Wiether it be the Mexican goverment arresting those who first arrive on the Pacific coast for fear of americans taking the land, or run ins with the more hostile native american tribes and the culture clash that occured there. Also such things as Choleria, robbery, and not being able to find adequate shelter during a rain storm on the oregon trail are things you might not think about when thinking about the settlers of the west.More remarkaby than when the show features the american struggles, is when it shows us what the native americans were going threw. In particular the Lakota. The way in which these people were first slaughtered and feared, and then lied to and cheated out of there lands is shown in the only way possible; brutal honesty and shame. And you can sense the later in the filmmakers. That we, as a nation, nearly wiped out an entire people and there traditions to accomidate our own greed is something none of us are aware of enough on a daily basis. Most notably the 5th episode shows how the U.S. forcably removes indian children from the camps and relocates them to teaching centers and forces them to forget there own ways, names and language so that they are ""more usefull members of american society"".It is a show to watch with a heavy heart, as you witness the tragedy that befell the natives, but at the same time you admire the guts and determination of the settlers to make a way of life for themselves away from the known and safe surroundings in the east. Memorable events such as the battle of little big horn, and the massacre at wounded knee creek conclude the series on a very melonchole note.It is a remarkable piece of film, TV or Movies, and an important part of our history we can NEVER forget. Thanks to the filmmakers, we have this forever to remind us of what we are, and were and how we got there.",5,Brilliant piece of filmmaking and history.,1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,2804,"['TNT', 'done', 'amazing', 'job', 'series', 'produced', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'episode', 'approx', '90', 'minutes', 'feels', 'own', 'movie', 'scale', 'attention', 'detail', 'drama', 'good', 'feel', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'emmense', 'job', 'was', 'done', 'series', 'alot', 'period', 'history', 'starting', 'be', 'forgotten', 'People', 'seem', 'think', 'defeated', 'british', 'twice', 'fought', 'civil', 'war', 'then', 'world', 'war', 'happened', 'appropriate', 'series', 'been', 'done', 'such', 'love', 'respect.It', 'easily', 'par', 'HBO', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'Earth', 'Moon', 'own', 'masterpieces', 'history', 'series', 'West', 'first', 'bands', 'hunters', 'frontiersmen', 'sought', 'find', 'there', 'way', 'Pacific', 'ocean', 'find', 'California', 'Settling', 'west', 'had', 'challenges', 'series', 'magnificent', 'job', 'showing', 'what', 'were', 'Wiether', 'be', 'Mexican', 'goverment', 'arresting', 'who', 'first', 'arrive', 'Pacific', 'coast', 'fear', 'americans', 'taking', 'land', 'run', 'ins', 'more', 'hostile', 'native', 'american', 'tribes', 'culture', 'clash', 'occured', 'there', 'Also', 'such', 'things', 'Choleria', 'robbery', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'adequate', 'shelter', 'rain', 'storm', 'oregon', 'trail', 'are', 'things', 'might', 'not', 'think', 'when', 'thinking', 'settlers', 'west.More', 'remarkaby', 'when', 'show', 'american', 'struggles', 'when', 'what', 'native', 'americans', 'were', 'going', 'threw', 'particular', 'Lakota', 'way', 'people', 'were', 'first', 'slaughtered', 'feared', 'then', 'lied', 'cheated', 'lands', 'shown', 'only', 'way', 'possible', 'brutal', 'honesty', 'shame', 'can', 'sense', 'later', 'filmmakers', 'nation', 'nearly', 'wiped', 'out', 'entire', 'people', 'traditions', 'accomidate', 'own', 'greed', 'something', 'none', 'are', 'aware', 'enough', 'daily', 'basis', 'Most', 'notably', '5th', 'episode', 'how', 'U.S.', 'forcably', 'indian', 'children', 'camps', 'teaching', 'centers', 'forces', 'forget', 'there', 'own', 'ways', 'names', 'language', 'so', 'are', 'more', 'usefull', 'members', 'american', 'society', '.It', 'show', 'watch', 'heavy', 'heart', 'witness', 'tragedy', 'befell', 'natives', 'same', 'time', 'admire', 'guts', 'determination', 'settlers', 'make', 'way', 'life', 'away', 'known', 'safe', 'surroundings', 'east', 'Memorable', 'events', 'such', 'battle', 'little', 'big', 'horn', 'massacre', 'wounded', 'knee', 'creek', 'conclude', 'series', 'very', 'melonchole', 'note.It', 'remarkable', 'piece', 'film', 'TV', 'Movies', 'important', 'part', 'history', 'can', 'NEVER', 'forget', 'Thanks', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'forever', 'remind', 'what', 'are', 'were', 'how', 'got', 'there']",N/A

I thought the idea of following the lives of a family of wheelwrights inspired, being such a key craft for those heading west.The series had great production values, beautiful locations, solid cinematography.There is a strong cast and many good performances.  One notable exception was Tom Berringer as the genocidal colonel in Colorado that unleashes attacks on the innocent Indians.  His performance was awful.  He delivered his lines woodenly, distractedly as if he had something else on his mind.The strong start though doesn't sustain unfortunately.While historically accurate (within the bounds of Hollywood) the series is Native American centric.  The Mexican American war, civil war, slavery, gold rush, foreign immigration are treated as side notes while the plot concentrates on the native American tragedy that took place, much of which is presented in an extended soap operaish tale.The plot drives along with its Native American theme, diverts briefly to something of historical significance, then it's back to a long stretch of As the Buffalo Turns.Without a doubt the Native American genocide was a big part o the pageant of opening the west by European settlers but there is so much more that is simply left out or given short shift that in the end I didn't even finish the series.

Those that want to know the truth about the settlement of the great American West will be enthralled by this realistic presentation of history, showing it as it actually happened. We see the Indian as a culture, living in harmony with nature, destroyed by an invading army of settlers and gold crazed miners, out to rape the land and kill anything or anyone who stood in their way. The US Calvary is portrayed as they really were: Blood thirsty killers that considered the Indians ""soulless heathens!""  You will cry many times during this series as the reality of those years hits you in the face. However, you'll become so involved in this presentation that you'll watch it over and over again, I promise you. You'll leave this series with a greater understanding of the conflicts that took place between the European culture of the white man and the Indians.

Of course I don't consider it historically accurate, but it has some background in hitorical places and events.  Speilberg is a master at these miniseries type shows and I love his touch.  Excellent scenery and locations throughout the show adds to the viewing.""Into the West"" also reminds me of the classic western ""How the West was Won"" in the way it follows one family through several genrations at different historical moments.  Another good thing about Into the West is that 'good guys' and 'bad guys' are not defined by their race or culture.This is my favorite along with ""Lonesome Dove"" (the original).",4,well done miniseries,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,826,"['have', 'say', 'really', 'miniseries', 'like', 'sagas', 'may', 'enjoy', 'how', 'story', 'fictional', 'family', 'many', 'historical', 'events', 'giving', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'show', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'historically', 'accurate', 'background', 'hitorical', 'places', 'events', 'Speilberg', 'master', 'miniseries', 'type', 'shows', 'love', 'touch', 'Excellent', 'scenery', 'locations', 'show', 'viewing', 'West', 'also', 'classic', 'western', 'How', 'West', 'was', 'Won', 'way', 'one', 'family', 'several', 'genrations', 'different', 'historical', 'moments', 'good', 'thing', 'Into', 'West', 'guys', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'defined', 'race', 'culture.This', 'favorite', 'Lonesome', 'Dove', 'original']",N/A

Any history of Westward Migration culminates in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. I understand they were under a TV budget but come on man! I recall Custer's last stand handled very poorly.  This is suppose to be THE CLIMAX? I have not watch it again since. I am A HUGE history buff.

931125,A3373I4II32NA1,B000AQ6A9E,Tyler,"[0, 1]","I don't care what people are saying in their complaints about this movie, like it being a &#34;watered-down version&#34; of the real thing. If this is truly watered down, it is truly touching and dramatic on the issues of what became of the TRUE American people who have settled this continent for centuries long before Europeans ever knew this continent and such a people ever existed, long before they ever got the guts to cross the unknown Atlantic for fear of &#34;falling off the edge of the earth.&#34;The fate of those who made this their home were to be forced against their will to live in &#34;concentration camps&#34; designated by government officials who didn't give a crap about the Native Americans, or dare to understand that the land they were being told to farm on wouldn't be sufficient to support even a single generation, or to be forced off of it anyway by white settlers and gold prospectors. But the U.S. government never called them prison camps, just &#34;reservations,&#34; which to me is a watered-down version of what their true definition was.This movie covers the times from 1826 to 1890, seen through the eyes of two American families, one of them NATIVE American. In the beginning, you see a young American boy from Virginia trekking through the unknown with other mountain men, like Jebediah Smith, in their quest to see the Pacific. By 1880, those unknown lands are long gone, railroads spanning the entire length of the country in a way never thought possible by earlier generations. The buffalo are nearly extinct, and the Natives who lived off these lands and respected the presence of the buffalo, forced to live a meager existence on &#34;reservations&#34; even to this day. I would have liked to have seen a coverage of the Trail of Tears in here, the 1836 exiled march of Indian tribes off their Georgia lands and to Oklahoma Territory, but what they didn't cover was made up for in other scenes of outrages done against the people who lived here before us and are more AMERICAN than we are.Like how in the 1850's, a small U.S. Army contingent opens fire on a Native American encampment after their idiot officer accuses the tribe of &#34;stealing a cow&#34; from a Mormon pioneer train, and their only way of communicating this to the Indians is through a drunk translator who isn't even capable of translating the Indian chief's offer to pay for the cow. The translator and all 30 Army soldiers were killed in this small fight that followed, and I was kind of actually rooting for the Indians here.In 1864, an encampment full of innocent Indians is slaughtered by more than 700 U.S. Army militia at Sand Creek, Colorado, despite the fact that the chief was flying an American flag due to earlier promises given to him that his people would have no harm come to him if he was to display that flag. This movie put great detail into that!In 1874, despite an 1868 treaty giving the Black Hills of South Dakota to the Sioux tribe, a small amount of gold is found in the Black Hills by prospectors illegally trespassing onto that land, and the U.S. Army does little to enforce that treaty, while the government seeks to twist the treaty around and tries to run all the Sioux off that land anyway. And any Sioux who protest this treatment and doesn't report to their prison camps are to be declared hostile by January, 1876. The U.S. Army sure got what was coming to them at the Little Big Horn! And all because Lt. Colonel Custer, when advised by his General in person to have his 7th Cavalry Regiment wait for the reinforcing troops, replies, &#34;No, sir, I will not&#34; before riding with his troopers in a charge for glory on June 25, 1876. We all know what happened next.In November, 1890, a stupid U.S. government reservation agent mistakes harmless &#34;Ghost Dancing&#34; to be an uprising by Sioux members who are simply praying and dancing to their ancestors for guidance in their struggle to survive, and sics the U.S. Army on them. 350 Sioux are slaughtered at Wounded Knee Creek, and their bodies are unable to be retrieved due to the snowstorm that follows.This movie really is an eye-opener and if this is the &#34;watered-down version&#34; of what TNT really had, then it is one of the best I have seen so far!",5,The disappearing frontiers,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",2014,4265,"['do', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'complaints', 'movie', 'being', '34', 'watered-down', 'version', '34', 'real', 'thing', 'truly', 'watered', 'down', 'truly', 'touching', 'dramatic', 'issues', 'what', 'became', 'TRUE', 'American', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'settled', 'continent', 'centuries', 'long', 'before', 'Europeans', 'ever', 'knew', 'continent', 'people', 'ever', 'existed', 'long', 'ever', 'got', 'guts', 'cross', 'unknown', 'Atlantic', 'fear', '34', 'falling', 'off', 'edge', 'earth.', '34', 'fate', 'who', 'made', 'home', 'were', 'be', 'forced', 'will', 'live', '34', 'concentration', 'camps', '34', 'designated', 'government', 'officials', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'crap', 'Native', 'Americans', 'dare', 'understand', 'land', 'were', 'being', 'told', 'farm', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'sufficient', 'support', 'even', 'single', 'generation', 'be', 'forced', 'anyway', 'white', 'settlers', 'gold', 'prospectors', 'U.S.', 'government', 'never', 'called', 'prison', 'camps', 'just', '34', 'reservations', '34', 'watered-down', 'version', 'what', 'true', 'definition', 'was.This', 'movie', 'times', '1826', '1890', 'seen', 'eyes', 'two', 'American', 'families', 'one', 'NATIVE', 'American', 'beginning', 'see', 'young', 'American', 'boy', 'Virginia', 'trekking', 'unknown', 'other', 'mountain', 'men', 'Jebediah', 'Smith', 'quest', 'see', 'Pacific', '1880', 'unknown', 'lands', 'are', 'long', 'gone', 'spanning', 'entire', 'length', 'country', 'way', 'never', 'thought', 'possible', 'earlier', 'generations', 'buffalo', 'are', 'nearly', 'extinct', 'Natives', 'who', 'lived', 'off', 'lands', 'respected', 'presence', 'buffalo', 'forced', 'live', 'meager', 'existence', '34', 'reservations', '34', 'even', 'day', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'coverage', 'Trail', 'Tears', 'here', '1836', 'exiled', 'march', 'Indian', 'tribes', 'off', 'Georgia', 'lands', 'Oklahoma', 'Territory', 'what', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'other', 'scenes', 'outrages', 'done', 'people', 'who', 'lived', 'here', 'are', 'more', 'AMERICAN', 'are.Like', 'how', '1850', 'small', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'contingent', 'fire', 'Native', 'American', 'encampment', 'idiot', 'officer', 'tribe', '34', 'stealing', 'cow', '34', 'Mormon', 'pioneer', 'train', 'only', 'way', 'communicating', 'Indians', 'drunk', 'translator', 'who', ""n't"", 'even', 'capable', 'translating', 'Indian', 'chief', 'offer', 'pay', 'cow', 'translator', '30', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'were', 'killed', 'small', 'fight', 'followed', 'was', 'kind', 'actually', 'rooting', 'Indians', 'here.In', '1864', 'encampment', 'full', 'innocent', 'Indians', 'slaughtered', 'more', '700', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'militia', 'Sand', 'Creek', 'Colorado', 'fact', 'chief', 'was', 'flying', 'American', 'flag', 'due', 'earlier', 'promises', 'given', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'harm', 'come', 'was', 'display', 'flag', 'movie', 'put', 'great', 'detail', '1874', '1868', 'treaty', 'giving', 'Black', 'Hills', 'South', 'Dakota', 'Sioux', 'tribe', 'small', 'amount', 'gold', 'found', 'Black', 'Hills', 'prospectors', 'illegally', 'trespassing', 'land', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'little', 'enforce', 'treaty', 'government', 'twist', 'treaty', 'around', 'tries', 'run', 'Sioux', 'off', 'land', 'anyway', 'Sioux', 'who', 'protest', 'treatment', ""n't"", 'report', 'prison', 'camps', 'are', 'be', 'declared', 'hostile', 'January', '1876', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'sure', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'Little', 'Big', 'Horn', 'Lt', 'Colonel', 'Custer', 'when', 'advised', 'General', 'person', 'have', '7th', 'Cavalry', 'Regiment', 'wait', 'reinforcing', 'troops', 'replies', '34', 'No', 'sir', 'will', 'not', '34', 'riding', 'troopers', 'charge', 'glory', 'June', '25', '1876', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'next.In', 'November', '1890', 'stupid', 'U.S.', 'government', 'reservation', 'agent', 'mistakes', 'harmless', '34', 'Ghost', 'Dancing', '34', 'be', 'uprising', 'Sioux', 'members', 'who', 'are', 'simply', 'praying', 'dancing', 'ancestors', 'guidance', 'struggle', 'survive', 'sics', 'U.S.', 'Army', '350', 'Sioux', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'Creek', 'bodies', 'are', 'unable', 'be', 'retrieved', 'due', 'snowstorm', 'follows.This', 'movie', 'really', 'eye-opener', '34', 'watered-down', 'version', '34', 'what', 'TNT', 'really', 'had', 'then', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'so', 'far']",N/A
