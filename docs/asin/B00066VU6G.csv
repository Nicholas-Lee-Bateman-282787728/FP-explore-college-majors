It was a weird movie, with some hilarious scenes, but there was just no way I was going to like the main characters. Sophie - an erotic writer - chases after Eddie, a jewel thief with a fiancee. There is nothing romantic about it. They willingly deceive Eddies girlfriend, Sophie knows about his illegal business and lies for him to the police. All ending in a very embarrassing scene with police listening in on them in a sleezy motelroom. This is not what I call romance....",3,Not very romantic,1112400000,"04 2, 2005",2005,547,"['saw', 'movie', 'last', 'night', 'not', 'left', 'much', 'impression', 'was', 'weird', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'there', 'was', 'just', 'way', 'was', 'going', 'like', 'main', 'characters', 'Sophie', 'erotic', 'writer', 'chases', 'Eddie', 'jewel', 'thief', 'fiancee', 'nothing', 'romantic', 'willingly', 'deceive', 'Eddies', 'girlfriend', 'Sophie', 'illegal', 'business', 'lies', 'police', 'ending', 'very', 'embarrassing', 'scene', 'police', 'listening', 'sleezy', 'motelroom', 'not', 'what', 'call', 'romance']",N/A
