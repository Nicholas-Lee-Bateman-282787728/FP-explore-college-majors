831797,A2EENVGNDH8N9G,B0002EJ7XU,Mike,"[1, 2]","Last night we watched `The Mistresses of Dr. Jekyll'. It's a 1964 Jesus Franco film with his usual offbeat scenes and characters that I like. At least I'll say I liked them from this earlier point in his long career. One of his later films I recently viewed `Killer Barbys' from 1996 was barely watchable.  I tend to agree with those who say his early work was his best. Mr. Franco died very recently so my wife and I, watched this film in his memory.One thing about the story struck me right off, there is no well known Dr. Jekyll to be found anywhere in this story.  At least not the infamous Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde we expect from the title. There is a Dr. with that same last name and no relation it seems. I have a feeling this last name was added later to help promote the movie as something it is not.  I'm even doubtful there was more than one mistress in the story for this Dr. The title implies he had many. There is an alternate title `Dr. Orloff's Monster' that's at least less misleading even if Dr. Orloff is only in a couple of very short scenes. Jekyll created the monster using Orloff's idea. I assume this is the same Orloff from Franco's other films. Orloff appeared to be on his deathbed at the beginning of the story telling his sonic sound secrets to Dr. Jekyll. Much later in the story we see Orloff looking healthy again; evidently he had a miraculous recovery off camera. Personally I think a more fitting title for this would have been `The Zombie's Daughter'. Yeah, I guess that doesn't hold the titillation factor the ""mistresses"" title has. Hey, if Dracula and Frankenstein can have films about their ""daughters"" why not a zombie [wink]? But enough already about the title used. The plot is a bit slow moving and contains numerous excuses to show seductive women performing in night clubs.  I expect that from Franco he does seem to appreciate the beauty of women. This was supposedly filmed in Spanish, if it was the dubbing to English was well done. The strange thing is it looked like the actors mouths were in time with the dubbed English words they were saying.  I thought they had spoken the dialog in English and maybe it was later dubbed in Spanish for that market, just a thought, I have no facts on it. The zombie in the story is animated by some nonsense about using ultrahigh frequency sounds.  I had to laugh at how they explained this like it made perfect sense. I also wondered why he wasn't being followed about by packs of dogs also hearing the sound. The victims are given a necklace that somehow attracts the monster. This is also explained by the police like it made perfect sense. The best part of the film was the zombie character; he was a cross between a slightly melting wax figure face and the mesmerized man in the silent `The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari'. He has similar unblinking wide open eyes.  The plot as I understood it involves a Dr. Conrad Jekyll who catches his supposedly beautiful young wife in bed with his better looking brother.  His brother had been visiting and was seduced by Jekyll's wife. He kills his brother and makes it look like a failed operation he performed.  He lets his own wife live after witnessing the murder, over the twenty or so years that follow she becomes a drunkard. We never learn why she hasn't told the police. Many years after the murder is when the film takes place. There is a brief flashback to what happened earlier. Dr. Jekyll now has a mistress on the side.  Why he decides to use his zombie like creation for killing her and other night club performing women is beyond me. Oh, did I mention the zombie is the body of his dead brother?  He somehow still looks relatively good considering how long he's been dead; he even walks through night clubs freely. At one point the Dr.'s college student niece comes to visit him.  This is the daughter of the brother he killed 18 or 20 years earlier.  She never knew her father since he died when she was young.  She sees a photo of dear old dad for the first time.  A photo her aunt still keeps of her lost lover.  I guess her mom didn't keep any photos of him. After a few days the alcoholic aunt finally tells the niece the story of what really happened to her dad and of their brief passionate affair. The Zombie dad will not harm his daughter and even saves her life.  Beats me how he recognizes this grown woman is his little daughter from years earlier. I won't spoil how it all ends except to say it's appropriate.The film did hold our interest and was pretty much what I expected.  I enjoyed it for what it was. I like the offbeat nature of Spanish and Italian made horror films.  Early in his career Franco make some decent ones.  I'll remember him for those.",3,A good example of Franco's early work,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",2013,4711,"['Last', 'night', 'watched', 'Mistresses', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', '1964', 'Jesus', 'Franco', 'film', 'usual', 'offbeat', 'scenes', 'characters', 'like', 'least', ""'ll"", 'say', 'liked', 'earlier', 'point', 'long', 'career', 'One', 'later', 'films', 'recently', 'viewed', 'Killer', 'Barbys', '1996', 'was', 'barely', 'watchable', 'tend', 'agree', 'who', 'say', 'early', 'work', 'was', 'best', 'Mr.', 'Franco', 'died', 'very', 'recently', 'wife', 'watched', 'film', 'memory.One', 'thing', 'story', 'struck', 'right', 'off', 'well', 'known', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'story', 'least', 'not', 'infamous', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Mr.', 'Hyde', 'expect', 'title', 'Dr.', 'same', 'last', 'name', 'relation', 'have', 'feeling', 'last', 'name', 'was', 'added', 'later', 'help', 'promote', 'movie', 'something', 'not', ""'m"", 'even', 'doubtful', 'there', 'was', 'more', 'one', 'mistress', 'story', 'Dr', 'title', 'had', 'many', 'alternate', 'title', 'Dr.', 'Orloff', 'Monster', 'least', 'less', 'misleading', 'even', 'Dr.', 'Orloff', 'only', 'couple', 'very', 'short', 'scenes', 'Jekyll', 'created', 'monster', 'using', 'Orloff', 'idea', 'assume', 'same', 'Orloff', 'Franco', 'other', 'films', 'Orloff', 'appeared', 'be', 'deathbed', 'beginning', 'story', 'telling', 'sonic', 'sound', 'secrets', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'Much', 'later', 'story', 'see', 'looking', 'healthy', 'again', 'evidently', 'had', 'miraculous', 'recovery', 'camera', 'Personally', 'think', 'more', 'fitting', 'title', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Zombie', 'Daughter', 'Yeah', 'guess', ""n't"", 'hold', 'titillation', 'factor', 'mistresses', 'title', 'Hey', 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', 'can', 'have', 'films', 'daughters', 'why', 'not', 'zombie', '[', 'wink', ']', 'enough', 'already', 'title', 'used', 'plot', 'bit', 'slow', 'moving', 'numerous', 'excuses', 'show', 'seductive', 'women', 'performing', 'night', 'clubs', 'expect', 'Franco', 'seem', 'appreciate', 'beauty', 'women', 'was', 'supposedly', 'filmed', 'Spanish', 'was', 'dubbing', 'English', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'strange', 'thing', 'looked', 'actors', 'mouths', 'were', 'time', 'dubbed', 'English', 'words', 'were', 'saying', 'thought', 'had', 'spoken', 'dialog', 'English', 'maybe', 'was', 'later', 'dubbed', 'Spanish', 'market', 'just', 'thought', 'have', 'facts', 'zombie', 'story', 'animated', 'nonsense', 'using', 'ultrahigh', 'frequency', 'had', 'laugh', 'how', 'explained', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'also', 'wondered', 'why', 'was', ""n't"", 'being', 'followed', 'packs', 'dogs', 'also', 'hearing', 'sound', 'victims', 'are', 'given', 'necklace', 'monster', 'also', 'explained', 'police', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'zombie', 'character', 'was', 'cross', 'slightly', 'melting', 'wax', 'figure', 'face', 'mesmerized', 'man', 'silent', 'Cabinet', 'Dr.', 'Caligari', 'similar', 'unblinking', 'wide', 'open', 'eyes', 'plot', 'understood', 'Dr.', 'Conrad', 'Jekyll', 'who', 'supposedly', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'bed', 'better', 'looking', 'brother', 'brother', 'had', 'been', 'visiting', 'was', 'seduced', 'Jekyll', 'wife', 'brother', 'look', 'failed', 'operation', 'performed', 'own', 'wife', 'live', 'witnessing', 'murder', 'twenty', 'so', 'years', 'follow', 'drunkard', 'never', 'learn', 'why', ""n't"", 'told', 'police', 'Many', 'years', 'murder', 'when', 'film', 'place', 'brief', 'flashback', 'what', 'happened', 'earlier', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'now', 'mistress', 'side', 'Why', 'use', 'zombie', 'creation', 'killing', 'other', 'night', 'club', 'performing', 'women', 'Oh', 'did', 'mention', 'zombie', 'body', 'dead', 'brother', 'somehow', 'still', 'relatively', 'good', 'considering', 'how', 'long', 'been', 'dead', 'even', 'walks', 'night', 'clubs', 'freely', 'one', 'point', 'Dr.', 'college', 'student', 'niece', 'visit', 'daughter', 'brother', 'killed', '18', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'never', 'knew', 'father', 'died', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'photo', 'dear', 'old', 'dad', 'first', 'time', 'photo', 'aunt', 'still', 'lost', 'lover', 'guess', 'mom', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'photos', 'few', 'days', 'alcoholic', 'aunt', 'finally', 'niece', 'story', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'dad', 'brief', 'passionate', 'affair', 'Zombie', 'dad', 'will', 'not', 'harm', 'daughter', 'even', 'life', 'Beats', 'how', 'grown', 'woman', 'little', 'daughter', 'years', 'earlier', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'how', 'say', 'appropriate.The', 'film', 'did', 'hold', 'interest', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'expected', 'enjoyed', 'what', 'was', 'offbeat', 'nature', 'Spanish', 'Italian', 'made', 'horror', 'films', 'Early', 'career', 'Franco', 'make', 'decent', 'ones', ""'ll"", 'remember']",The Orloff Collection: (The Awful Dr. Orloff / Dr. Orloff's Monster / Revenge in the House of Usher / Orloff and the Invisible Man)
831798,A2F3M93RRLFQNJ,B0002EJ7XU,mrliteral,"[17, 25]","With the exception of English works, European horror tends to have more of a cult following in the U.S. than a popular one.  Certainly, European horror has a lot to offer, including some of the early German films such as Nosferatu.  Later, such names as Dario Argento and Mario Bava would present horror films that were distinctly different from American works.  But, just as there are plenty of lesser American horror films, there are plenty of lesser European ones, and the prolific director Jess Franco has created his share of those.The Orloff Collection presents a set of four movies, three of which were directed by Franco.  The name itself is a misnomer:  the villainous Dr. Orloff only appears in two of the four; in one other, he is referred to, and the fourth just uses clips from an Orloff movie.  They are of varying quality, but generally get worse as they go along.The first in the set is The Awful Dr. Orlof (only one ""f"" in his debut), a film that was originally double-billed with the similarly named (but more well-respected) The Horrible Dr. Hichcock.  Orlof (played by Howard Vernon) is your standard mad scientist out to kidnap women to use their parts to restore his ill sister.  He has a freakish henchman, a murderous blind man who acts as Orlof's slave.  This is probably the best in the set, and even this one is only three star material.Orloff (or Orlof) is nowhere to be seen in Dr. Orloff's Monster, in which the mad scientist is this time named Dr. Fisherman.  Fisherman has re-animated his dead brother to serve as a unkillable monster who will murder Fisherman's enemies.  Occasionally, there will be some women killed too.  The appearance of Fisherman's niece will throw some wrenches into the monkey works.In Orloff and the Invisible Man, Orloff has returned, this time with an invisible killer as his slave and some vague plans of creating a super race of invisible monsters.  A doctor - summoned by Orloff's daughter - learns of the plot and tries to derail it.  Like the other movies, this one has minimal special effects, bland acting (even taking the dubbing into account), and cheesy make-up jobs.  This is usually made up for with gratuitous nudity, and this one has it in spades.  (This one, by the way, was actually directed by Pierre Chevalier.)Finally, Revenge in the House of Usher illustrates that the worst thing a film (in any genre) can be is not poorly written, acted or directed, but simply boring.  This retelling of Poe's classic story is far better in the Roger Corman version starring Vincent Price.  Here, it is muddled and a thudding bore.  And there is no Orloff:  instead, Vernon plays Usher, though clips are used from The Awful Dr. Orloff for flashback material.I'm sure Franco has his devotees, but from this set, it's hard to understand why (I've also seen a couple of his Fu Manchu movies and his version of Dracula, and none of them are very good either).  These films don't even fit into the category so-bad-they're good, and with a minimum of extras, I have to give the set as a whole two stars.  Even for horror fans, this one doesn't offer much more that the routine and the tedious.",2,"Mediocrity, thy name is Franco",1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,3153,"['exception', 'English', 'works', 'European', 'horror', 'have', 'more', 'cult', 'following', 'U.S.', 'popular', 'one', 'Certainly', 'European', 'horror', 'lot', 'offer', 'including', 'early', 'German', 'films', 'such', 'Nosferatu', 'Later', 'such', 'names', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Mario', 'Bava', 'would', 'present', 'horror', 'films', 'were', 'distinctly', 'different', 'American', 'works', 'just', 'are', 'plenty', 'lesser', 'American', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'plenty', 'lesser', 'European', 'ones', 'prolific', 'director', 'Jess', 'Franco', 'created', 'share', 'those.The', 'Orloff', 'Collection', 'set', 'four', 'movies', 'three', 'were', 'directed', 'Franco', 'name', 'misnomer', 'villainous', 'Dr.', 'Orloff', 'only', 'two', 'four', 'one', 'other', 'referred', 'fourth', 'just', 'clips', 'Orloff', 'movie', 'are', 'varying', 'quality', 'generally', 'get', 'worse', 'go', 'along.The', 'first', 'set', 'Awful', 'Dr.', 'Orlof', 'only', 'one', 'f', 'debut', 'film', 'was', 'originally', 'double-billed', 'similarly', 'named', 'more', 'well-respected', 'Horrible', 'Dr.', 'Hichcock', 'Orlof', 'played', 'Howard', 'Vernon', 'standard', 'mad', 'scientist', 'kidnap', 'women', 'use', 'parts', 'restore', 'ill', 'sister', 'freakish', 'henchman', 'murderous', 'blind', 'man', 'who', 'Orlof', 'slave', 'probably', 'best', 'set', 'even', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'star', 'material.Orloff', 'Orlof', 'nowhere', 'be', 'seen', 'Dr.', 'Orloff', 'Monster', 'mad', 'scientist', 'time', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Fisherman', 'Fisherman', 're-animated', 'dead', 'brother', 'serve', 'unkillable', 'monster', 'who', 'will', 'murder', 'Fisherman', 'enemies', 'Occasionally', 'will', 'be', 'women', 'killed', 'too', 'appearance', 'Fisherman', 'niece', 'will', 'throw', 'wrenches', 'monkey', 'works.In', 'Orloff', 'Invisible', 'Man', 'Orloff', 'returned', 'time', 'invisible', 'killer', 'slave', 'vague', 'plans', 'creating', 'super', 'race', 'invisible', 'monsters', 'doctor', 'summoned', 'Orloff', 'daughter', 'learns', 'plot', 'tries', 'derail', 'other', 'movies', 'one', 'minimal', 'special', 'effects', 'bland', 'acting', 'even', 'taking', 'dubbing', 'account', 'cheesy', 'make-up', 'jobs', 'usually', 'made', 'up', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'one', 'spades', 'one', 'way', 'was', 'actually', 'directed', 'Pierre', 'Chevalier', 'Finally', 'Revenge', 'House', 'Usher', 'worst', 'thing', 'film', 'genre', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'poorly', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'simply', 'boring', 'retelling', 'Poe', 'classic', 'story', 'far', 'better', 'Roger', 'Corman', 'version', 'starring', 'Vincent', 'Price', 'Here', 'muddled', 'thudding', 'bore', 'Orloff', 'instead', 'Vernon', 'Usher', 'clips', 'are', 'used', 'Awful', 'Dr.', 'Orloff', 'flashback', 'material.I', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Franco', 'devotees', 'set', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', ""'ve"", 'also', 'seen', 'couple', 'Fu', 'Manchu', 'movies', 'version', 'Dracula', 'none', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'either', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'fit', 'category', 'so-bad-they', ""'re"", 'good', 'minimum', 'extras', 'have', 'give', 'set', 'whole', 'two', 'stars', 'Even', 'horror', 'fans', 'one', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'more', 'routine', 'tedious']",The Orloff Collection: (The Awful Dr. Orloff / Dr. Orloff's Monster / Revenge in the House of Usher / Orloff and the Invisible Man)
