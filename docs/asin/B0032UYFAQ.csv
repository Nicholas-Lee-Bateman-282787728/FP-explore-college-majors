I have read the other reviews that have been previously written, and it's hard to add anything to them. All of us are excited about these 13 videos that are full of drama, intrigue, pathos, excitement, and just plain moving entertainment. The acting, casting, and certainly the writing in this series are nothing short of superb.As the 13th segment came to its end there were a number of unresolved issues in the plot, with a few brand new matters on the horizon. I am not going to even speculate here on a few of the developing situations. There are new members of the cast. I miss some of the old ones; however, the new members have brought much skill, charm, and new dimensions to the show.I've got one thing to say to the cast & writers of this show: You are doing an outstanding job.

1319411,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,B0032UYFAQ,Brian Maitland,"[1, 1]","Now changing tack midway through a TV series often is death but ""Friday Night Lights"" pulls this off. After Season 3 we had an inkling of what was to come but a whole new cast of characters was added as Coach Taylor takes over the very rundown and neglected East Dillon (located in the poor part of town) football program. Some older characters (Matt and Lyla) do flit in and out but Riggins is still front and center even though he has graduated from high school and Landry (or Lance as Coach Taylor still calls him at times) still adds comic relief.The real revelation of the new cast is Michael B. Jordan (yes, that's his real name) who plays Vince the new quarterback of East Dillon. Much of his back story is heartbreaking, but he is the fulcrum around which the entire season revolves around.Of the four seasons so far this is arguably the best just because the established characters and the new ones mesh so well.

1319416,A1J6HM96AAP5ZU,B0032UYFAQ,Dolphin,"[37, 39]","The writers had quite a task in Season 4 in a short 13-episode season.  Unlike so many of the teenage shows, FNLs actually allows its key young actors to move on, sometimes come back ... just as in real life.  And it introduces new characters into the lives of the people of Dillon.  This coming and going of people in their lives is just as it is in high schools across America.Season 4 centers around Coach Taylor's exile to dilapidated East Dillon High school, while his beloved wife, Tami, remains Principal of Dillon High.  The re-districting creates a schism between the Taylors, the Panthers and the Lions, the students of the 2 schools, the Boosters, and the town make for some interesting story-telling.  It also creates a further schism between the races and economic classes ... the ""haves"" and the ""have nots.""  This season mirrors the Great Recession where everyone but a very few struggles.  Tami is now the major breadwinner in their family, Coach is still out on a 2 year ""non-compete"" from his contract with TMU, there are no jobs in Dillon.  Buddy is no longer the richest man in Dillon, as his car dealership struggles.  The richest man is now Joe McCoy, the Stud of Suds.  (In real life, beer sales are in fact at an all time high during this recession ... so this seems very fitting).  McCoy is oblivious to the suffering of others, as his family is unaffected and his eye remains on making his son the greatest quarterback in the history of Texas.This divide is going to cause the same conflict that so many re-districted towns experience ... all anchored this season by the Coach and his family.  The writers throw everything but the kitchen sink at Taylors this season(as well as some other key characters). As Coach said in the Pilot episode, now, they will all be tested.  In the backdrop of this unrelenting economy ... I thought the writers did an excellent job of tapping into what is happening in America today ... how we are all being tested.This season plays special homage to Matt Saracen and Tim Riggins, in the same thoughtful way that Smash and Jason Street were showcased in special episodes.  Compelling new characters are introduced, most noteworthy: Vince, Jesse, and Luke.  An episode called ""The Son,"" is one of the stand out episodes of the entire 4 years of the show.This was a lot for the writers to take on in 13 episodes.  For the most part, I thought they were very successful!  In fact, I put this season on par with Season 1 in terms of story-telling, acting, casting.  In my very honest opinion, Kyle Chandler, Connie Britton, and Zach Gilford (for 'The Son') are deserving of the Emmy for their performances in Season 4 ... not the nomination, but the actual statues themselves.  They turned in outstanding performances, time and time again.  Taylor Kitsch, Brad Leland, and Amy Teagarden also turn in some very, very fine performances.",5,Still the BEST Show on Television,1274918400,"05 27, 2010",2010,2888,"['writers', 'had', 'quite', 'task', 'Season', '4', 'short', '13-episode', 'season', 'Unlike', 'so', 'many', 'teenage', 'FNLs', 'actually', 'key', 'young', 'actors', 'move', 'sometimes', 'come', 'back', 'just', 'real', 'life', 'new', 'characters', 'lives', 'people', 'Dillon', 'coming', 'going', 'people', 'lives', 'just', 'high', 'schools', 'America.Season', '4', 'centers', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'exile', 'dilapidated', 'East', 'Dillon', 'High', 'school', 'beloved', 'wife', 'Tami', 'Principal', 'Dillon', 'High', 're-districting', 'schism', 'Taylors', 'Panthers', 'Lions', 'students', '2', 'schools', 'Boosters', 'town', 'make', 'interesting', 'story-telling', 'also', 'further', 'schism', 'races', 'economic', 'classes', 'haves', 'have', 'nots', 'season', 'Great', 'Recession', 'where', 'everyone', 'very', 'few', 'struggles', 'Tami', 'now', 'major', 'breadwinner', 'family', 'Coach', 'still', 'out', '2', 'year', 'non-compete', 'contract', 'TMU', 'are', 'jobs', 'Dillon', 'Buddy', 'no', 'longer', 'richest', 'man', 'Dillon', 'car', 'dealership', 'richest', 'man', 'now', 'Joe', 'McCoy', 'Stud', 'Suds', 'real', 'life', 'beer', 'sales', 'are', 'fact', 'time', 'high', 'recession', 'so', 'very', 'fitting', 'McCoy', 'oblivious', 'suffering', 'others', 'family', 'unaffected', 'eye', 'making', 'son', 'greatest', 'quarterback', 'history', 'Texas.This', 'divide', 'going', 'cause', 'same', 'conflict', 'so', 'many', 're-districted', 'towns', 'experience', 'anchored', 'season', 'Coach', 'family', 'writers', 'throw', 'everything', 'kitchen', 'sink', 'Taylors', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'key', 'characters', 'Coach', 'said', 'Pilot', 'episode', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'tested', 'backdrop', 'unrelenting', 'economy', 'thought', 'writers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'tapping', 'what', 'happening', 'America', 'today', 'how', 'are', 'being', 'tested.This', 'season', 'special', 'homage', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'Tim', 'Riggins', 'same', 'thoughtful', 'way', 'Smash', 'Jason', 'Street', 'were', 'showcased', 'special', 'episodes', 'Compelling', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'introduced', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'Vince', 'Jesse', 'Luke', 'episode', 'called', 'Son', 'one', 'stand', 'out', 'episodes', 'entire', '4', 'years', 'show.This', 'was', 'lot', 'writers', 'take', '13', 'episodes', 'most', 'part', 'thought', 'were', 'very', 'successful', 'fact', 'put', 'season', 'par', 'Season', '1', 'terms', 'story-telling', 'acting', 'casting', 'very', 'honest', 'opinion', 'Kyle', 'Chandler', 'Connie', 'Britton', 'Zach', 'Gilford', ""'The"", 'Son', 'are', 'deserving', 'Emmy', 'performances', 'Season', '4', 'not', 'nomination', 'actual', 'turned', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'Brad', 'Leland', 'Amy', 'Teagarden', 'also', 'turn', 'very', 'very', 'fine', 'performances']",N/A

1319418,A3Q65632Z2K95F,B0032UYFAQ,James Goodwin,"[3, 3]","Everything that makes 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Friday Night Lights' is present in this season. Interesting characters, entertaining stories, gripping drama, touching relationships, and, last but sort of least, thrilling football moments. I haven't enjoyed a season quite this much since the first (though the third is a close runner up).Some of the stand-out episodes of the series came during this season, particularly ""The Son,"" ""I Can't,"" and ""Thanksgiving"" -- all of which feature some exceptional writing and memorable performances. In a pleasant surprise, the new characters fit in quite well, and as the season progressed, I found myself rooting for them right along with the old favorites. It's great to see so many of the veteran characters and relationships given due attention and proper tributes, and it's also good to watch some nice new bonds develop. My favorite interactions were between Tim and newcomer Becky (Madison Burge, who gives a great performance in ""I Can't""), a spunky, slightly younger girl who develops romantic feelings for him. This amounted to a charming, awkward, and touching bond that helped to develop both characters, further highlighting just how much Tim's matured since the show began.Other newcomers include the brooding but noble Vince, the imperfect but dedicated Luke, and the mature, good-spirited Jess -- along with the welcome returns of Matt, Julie, and Landry. Alongside Tim and Becky, the collective group of younger characters interact quite well with each other, making for some decent love triangles (of the tolerable, well-handled variety), and well-nurtured friendships.Amidst it all, the grown-ups are kept just as prominent and sympathetic as ever. Coach Eric Taylor is still written as a great motivator and mentor, on and off the field, while Principal Tami Taylor remains a sensitive, noble figure who I found myself rooting for more than ever by season's end.When all is said and done, 'Friday Night Lights' is likely to be remembered as one of the great television accomplishments. It's one of those rare shows -- not unlike the original 'Degrassi' or 'Once and Again' -- that captures the hardships and joys of the human condition in a rare, special kind of way.",5,Great Season,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",2010,2225,"['Everything', 'Night', 'Lights', ""'Friday"", 'Night', 'Lights', 'present', 'season', 'Interesting', 'characters', 'entertaining', 'stories', 'gripping', 'drama', 'touching', 'relationships', 'last', 'sort', 'least', 'thrilling', 'football', 'moments', 'have', ""n't"", 'enjoyed', 'season', 'quite', 'much', 'first', 'third', 'close', 'runner', 'up', '.Some', 'stand-out', 'episodes', 'series', 'came', 'season', 'particularly', 'Son', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Thanksgiving', 'feature', 'exceptional', 'writing', 'memorable', 'performances', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'new', 'characters', 'fit', 'quite', 'well', 'season', 'progressed', 'found', 'rooting', 'right', 'old', 'favorites', 'great', 'see', 'so', 'many', 'veteran', 'characters', 'relationships', 'given', 'due', 'attention', 'proper', 'tributes', 'also', 'good', 'watch', 'nice', 'new', 'bonds', 'develop', 'favorite', 'interactions', 'were', 'Tim', 'newcomer', 'Becky', 'Madison', 'Burge', 'who', 'great', 'performance', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'spunky', 'slightly', 'younger', 'girl', 'who', 'romantic', 'feelings', 'amounted', 'charming', 'awkward', 'touching', 'bond', 'helped', 'develop', 'characters', 'further', 'highlighting', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'Tim', 'matured', 'show', 'newcomers', 'include', 'brooding', 'noble', 'Vince', 'imperfect', 'dedicated', 'Luke', 'mature', 'good-spirited', 'Jess', 'welcome', 'returns', 'Matt', 'Julie', 'Landry', 'Alongside', 'Tim', 'Becky', 'collective', 'group', 'younger', 'characters', 'interact', 'quite', 'well', 'other', 'making', 'decent', 'love', 'triangles', 'tolerable', 'well-handled', 'variety', 'well-nurtured', 'friendships.Amidst', 'grown-ups', 'are', 'kept', 'just', 'prominent', 'sympathetic', 'ever', 'Coach', 'Eric', 'Taylor', 'still', 'written', 'great', 'motivator', 'mentor', 'field', 'Principal', 'Tami', 'Taylor', 'sensitive', 'noble', 'figure', 'who', 'found', 'rooting', 'more', 'ever', 'season', 'end.When', 'said', 'done', 'Night', 'Lights', 'likely', 'be', 'remembered', 'one', 'great', 'television', 'accomplishments', 'one', 'rare', 'shows', 'not', 'original', ""'Degrassi"", ""'Once"", 'Again', 'hardships', 'joys', 'human', 'condition', 'rare', 'special', 'kind', 'way']",N/A

It is years ahead of its time and will be judged a classic in retrospect more than competing in the vacuous crowded market of the TV of today. Yet I have to say, this series begins the show the cracks of a series that has lost too many of its great original characters. Even though Zack Gilford makes nine appearances in this season, the loss of so many of the others is hugely felt and sadly the new recruits just dont have the  stories that are as interesting. (this affects things even more in season five until many of the originals return to farewell the series).Taylor Kitsch is wonderful and he makes the season worthwhile and the episode ""The Son""is the best episode of the entire season (why Gilford didnt win an Emmy for this is inexcusable), also good as Michael Jordan is, there is too much emphasis on his story and crime and bad guys start to make it all look too much like a cop show. A lot of people didnt like the murder storyline in season two, yet I find the endless amount of crime and consequences changes the series too much in this season.Kitsch, Gilford, Scott Porter were the heart of the young cast and without Porter, less of Gilford and Kitsch written out for most of season five diffuses what is and remains a very strong series.",4,"Great, but lacks the strength of the original cast",1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,1304,"['remarkable', 'series', 'surprise', 'years', 'ahead', 'time', 'will', 'be', 'judged', 'classic', 'retrospect', 'more', 'competing', 'vacuous', 'crowded', 'market', 'TV', 'today', 'have', 'say', 'series', 'show', 'cracks', 'series', 'lost', 'too', 'many', 'great', 'original', 'characters', 'Even', 'Zack', 'Gilford', 'nine', 'appearances', 'season', 'loss', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'hugely', 'felt', 'sadly', 'new', 'recruits', 'just', 'dont', 'have', 'stories', 'are', 'interesting', 'things', 'even', 'more', 'season', 'five', 'many', 'originals', 'return', 'farewell', 'series', '.Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'wonderful', 'season', 'worthwhile', 'episode', 'Son', 'best', 'episode', 'entire', 'season', 'why', 'Gilford', 'didnt', 'win', 'Emmy', 'inexcusable', 'also', 'good', 'Michael', 'Jordan', 'too', 'much', 'emphasis', 'story', 'crime', 'bad', 'guys', 'start', 'make', 'look', 'too', 'much', 'cop', 'show', 'lot', 'people', 'didnt', 'murder', 'storyline', 'season', 'two', 'find', 'endless', 'amount', 'crime', 'consequences', 'series', 'too', 'much', 'season.Kitsch', 'Gilford', 'Scott', 'Porter', 'were', 'heart', 'young', 'cast', 'Porter', 'less', 'Gilford', 'Kitsch', 'written', 'out', 'most', 'season', 'five', 'diffuses', 'what', 'very', 'strong', 'series']",N/A

1319432,A1F93NA8HQ47IU,B0032UYFAQ,"Reconnecting To My Childhood ""Time Won't Let ...","[30, 33]","***Spoiler Free Review of the Season***The fourth season of Friday Night Lights was fantastic! It's a very important season of transition for the show as it attempts to move from the show we knew into the show it has to become. Rather than allow it to become a standard drama that repeats the same stories with the same characters the writer's decided to work on having characters we love move on in realistic fashion at the same time as they introduced us to and tried to make us care for new ones. To help ease the transition the writers wisely cheat to keep familiar faces Landry and Julie around for one more year of high school. Meanwhile Matt Saracen and Tim Riggins are both still struggling to get their lives started this season and they each hold some of it's strongest scenes in a season partially designed to give their amazing characters proper send off.The show can never exist without the continued presence of Eric and Tammy Taylor at it's core to hold all the pieces together. This year finds the happily married couple facing much more daunting issues and problems than they have in any previous season. They constantly struggle to keep their lives, and the lives of the kids around them together. All the while Eric and Tammy seem to be continually punished by the community simply for doing what's right. The best thing about the Taylor's  is rather than dealing with conflict within their relationship the writers keep them a united loving couple dealing with external conflict caused by life, which is much more relatable and realistic.The fourth season consists of thirteen very strongly crafted episodes spanning one high school football season in the town of Dillon:East of DillonAfter the FallIn the Sking of a LionA Sort of HomecomingThe Son (*Fantastic Episode, deserves an Emmy)StayIn the BagToilet BowlLights of Carrol ParkI Can'tInjury ListLaboringThanksgivingSpecial Features Included On This Set:- Deleted Scenes- Peter Berg Intros: Three short interviews with Peter Berg as he talks about directing the season premiere, the unique shooting style of the show and where this season starts off.- Commentary on 'East of Dillon' by Executive Producer Jason Katims- Friday Night Lights...Camera, Action! - A featurette that goes on set and finds the cast and crew discussing the unique shooting style and the amazing staying power of this fan adored show.

(Again runs just over 7mins)- Playbook - Learn more about the shooting of a football game scene for Friday Night Lights. Cast and crew discuss  the work and some of the complications that go into creating game scenes. (Runs just under 5mins)The special features are great and will be entertaining for any fan of the series to watch. While I wish there was more that doesn't mean we aren't getting our money's worth. I do however strongly wish there had been some mention to the individual storylines they crafted for the season, and I would have loved commentary on episodes 'The Son' and 'Thanksgiving'. Still, I'm very happy with what we're given here knowing that they made these special features specifically to please the shows die hard fans.There are a lot of new faces this year with Vince, Luke, Becky and Jess but I find them to be great replacements for the cast that has moved on and honestly feel they hold just as strong storytelling possibilities as the original cast did. Vince is a complex character who slowly earns our respect. He and Jess already clearly have  unspoken history together and Becky and Luke by seasons end have gone through one of the most difficult experiences that two teens can go through. Though no one will ever replace Matt Saracen as a wonderfully crafted and instantly likable character, these characters quickly grow on you.I have always loved this show, even in the messy parts of season two, but this year was particularly great. They were able to tell so many different levels of stories and all while keeping the drama involved in them at a completely realistic level. In comparison with the fantastic first season of the series that taught us the uplifting message that ""Clear Eyes, Full Hearts Can't Lose"" this season goes out of it's way to teach us in the same uplifting way that ""Clear Eyes, Full Hearts Can Lose"" but what matters is how you deal with it and how you let it define you from there.As the show moved to DirecTV and 13 episode seasons I found the writing return to the greatness we expected in the first season and with the excellent handheld camerawork and character acting that makes you feel as if you are right there watching what you feel are real people, Friday Night Lights now feels like a cable series that could become as great as The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men or Breaking Bad. This is a fantastic show and I'm ecstatic that this season has been released on DVD with some special features. It gets better each time I view it.Hopefully many others will buy this set and watch the fifth season too, thanks for your time.*On a small note I'm usually okay when shows have to change music for a DVD release but was really disappointed that they had to change Bob Dylan's ""Don't think twice, it's alright"" to another song at the end of episode 'Stay'. Guess I'll keep my downloaded version of that episode. Several other songs are also replaced with sound alike music and usually at key moments, just a heads up.",5,The Lights Shine In East Dillion,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",2010,5534,"['***Spoiler', 'Free',

1319435,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0032UYFAQ,Robert Moore,"[8, 13]","I'm going to keep this spoiler free, since most people will be seeing this on NBC in the summer of 2010, instead of late fall, early winter on DirecTV.  Frankly, I'm quite surprised at the other reviews here (some of which were written before the end of the season).  I'm as big a fan of FNL as there is (last time I checked, I had the featured review for the first three seasons of the show, which demonstrates how passionately I love this show), but by no imaginable standard was this season as good as the previous three.  Instead of revealing plot details, I'm going to talk in generalities about why I didn't think that this was as good as previous seasons, even while I definitely think that it is still worth watching.So, what went wrong?  I think there are two answers to this, one that is speculation about what is happening behind the camera and the other is more observations about what is happening in front of it.It is difficult to gauge just how much the lessened involvement of Jason Katims and Jeffrey Reiner in Season Four hurt the show, but it is pretty clear that the narrative lacked the depth and brilliance of earlier seasons.  The fall in quality came out in a number of ways, not just in writing but in camera work and even music.  In far too many ways Season Four felt like a ghost image of earlier seasons, and the entire creative aspect to the show was clearly partially to blame for it.The more obvious lack in the show as the loss of so many key cast members from the first seasons.  Matt appeared in only part of the season, Lyla only in an episode or two, and Tyra, my favorite character, not at all.  There were several new characters, all of them fairly enjoyable, but with the appearance of the new characters we lost most of the interpersonal history of the first three seasons.  And with only thirteen episodes, there was simply not enough time to lay the foundations for the deep story lines that we witnessed in the first three seasons.  And there were fewer narratives of success than we saw in earlier years, like Tyra's growth as a person or Matt's emergence as both a football player and a human being.  There were some success stories in Season Four, but they simply didn't feel as substantive as those in earlier seasons.It was obvious from the end of Season Three that this season was going to have some major changes, but all in all I felt that the additions to the show managed to equal the loss to the show, both actor and the creative staff that included Jason Katims and Jeffrey Reiner.  I hope that the show can rebound in Season Five, but with Katims focused on PARENTHOOD and with Taylor Kitsch unlikely to be deeply involved in Season Five (because of shooting of a major big-budget motion picture, JOHN CARTER OF MARS, with Taylor playing the role of none other than John Carter, a film based on Edgar Rice Burroughs's series of novels).  If they say goodbye to Landry as they have other major characters and if Adrianne Palicki, who has been working on a string of films, is unable to return as Tyra, Season Five could be disappointing indeed.  I absolutely adored FNL during its first three seasons, even in Season Two despite the much criticized murder arc, but in Season Four it was not quite the must-see TV that it had been.",4,A nonspoiler review of Season Four,1266019200,"02 13, 2010",2010,3285,"[""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'spoiler', 'free', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'NBC', 'summer', '2010', 'instead', 'late', 'fall', 'early', 'winter', 'DirecTV', 'Frankly', ""'m"", 'quite', 'surprised', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'were', 'written', 'end', 'season', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'FNL', 'last', 'time', 'checked', 'had', 'featured', 'review', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'how', 'passionately', 'love', 'show', 'imaginable', 'standard', 'was', 'season', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'three', 'Instead', 'revealing', 'plot', 'details', ""'m"", 'going', 'talk', 'generalities', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'previous', 'seasons', 'even', 'definitely', 'think', 'still', 'worth', 'watching.So', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'think', 'are', 'two', 'answers', 'one', 'speculation', 'what', 'happening', 'camera', 'other', 'more', 'observations', 'what', 'happening', 'front', 'it.It', 'difficult', 'gauge', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'lessened', 'involvement', 'Jason', 'Katims', 'Jeffrey', 'Reiner', 'Season', 'Four', 'hurt', 'show', 'pretty', 'clear', 'narrative', 'lacked', 'depth', 'brilliance', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'fall', 'quality', 'came', 'out', 'number', 'ways', 'not', 'just', 'writing', 'camera', 'work', 'even', 'music', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'ways', 'Season', 'Four', 'felt', 'ghost', 'image', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'entire', 'creative', 'aspect', 'show', 'was', 'clearly', 'partially', 'blame', 'it.The', 'more', 'obvious', 'lack', 'show', 'loss', 'so', 'many', 'key', 'cast', 'members', 'first', 'seasons', 'Matt', 'appeared', 'only', 'part', 'season', 'Lyla', 'only', 'episode', 'two', 'Tyra', 'favorite', 'character', 'not', 'were', 'several', 'new', 'characters', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'appearance', 'new', 'characters', 'lost', 'most', 'interpersonal', 'history', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'only', 'thirteen', 'episodes', 'was', 'simply', 'not', 'enough', 'time', 'lay', 'foundations', 'deep', 'story', 'lines', 'witnessed', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'were', 'fewer', 'narratives', 'success', 'saw', 'earlier', 'years', 'Tyra', 'growth', 'person', 'Matt', 'emergence', 'football', 'player', 'human', 'being', 'were', 'success', 'stories', 'Season', 'Four', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'as', 'substantive', 'earlier', 'seasons.It', 'was', 'obvious', 'end', 'Season', 'Three', 'season', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'major', 'changes', 'felt', 'additions', 'show', 'managed', 'equal', 'loss', 'show', 'actor', 'creative', 'staff', 'included', 'Jason', 'Katims', 'Jeffrey', 'Reiner', 'hope', 'show', 'can', 'rebound', 'Season', 'Five', 'Katims', 'focused', 'PARENTHOOD', 'Taylor', 'Kitsch', 'unlikely', 'be', 'deeply', 'involved', 'Season', 'Five', 'shooting', 'major', 'big-budget', 'motion', 'picture', 'JOHN', 'CARTER', 'OF', 'MARS', 'Taylor', 'playing', 'role', 'none', 'other', 'John', 'Carter', 'film', 'based', 'Edgar', 'Rice', 'Burroughs', 'series', 'novels', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Landry', 'have', 'other', 'major', 'characters', 'Adrianne', 'Palicki', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'string', 'films', 'unable', 'return', 'Tyra', 'Season', 'Five', 'could', 'be', 'disappointing', 'indeed', 'absolutely', 'adored', 'FNL', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'even', 'Season', 'Two', 'much', 'criticized', 'murder', 'arc', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'must-see', 'TV', 'had', 'been']",N/A

1319445,AP3B615GM191G,B0032UYFAQ,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","After the third season of ""Friday Night Lights"", the show (while still interesting) had hit a bit of a dry spell with many of the characters that had been the focal points of earlier seasons.  ""Smash"" Williams was given his goodbye, Jason Street kind of just faded away, and Tyra & Tim were given the same dramatic material episode after episode.  Thus,, the show writers introduced some new characters and scenery into this fourth season and really invigorated a show that needed a spark to really continue at a high level.This season of the show sees Coach Taylor now coaching the East Dillon Lions, a ragtag football program barely up off the ground.  Quite a switch from the prestigious West Dillon Panthers, to be sure!  While the early portion of the season focuses on that enormous change and the effects it has on the Taylor family (and Matt Saracen), the season eventually becomes all about the newcomers, including...-The two stars of East Dillon: Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan), a youth with a very trouble past and a very uncertain future, and Luke Cafferty (Matt Laurie), who is forced to transfer West-to-East due to some dishonesty among the football boosters.-Jess Merriweather (Jurnee Smollett), who shares feelings both for Vince and Landry after a meeting of fate seems to bring them together.-Becky Sproles (Dora Madison Burge), who has an intriguing relationship with Tim Riggins.All of those new characters add an emotional ""punch"" the show that it had been missing since, in all honesty, about midway through the second season.  The show becomes a little bit more about ""issues"" than it does about ""individuals"", but with such a rotating, evolving cast this formula ends up working out very well.Overall, then, I consider the fourth season of ""FNL"" to have been a rousing success.  Whereas the third season had dropped into 3-star territory for me, this campaign injected new life into the proceedings and really sucked me into pretty all the different plotlines.  You will be amazed at how a show that has been set in the same basic place (Dillon, TX) for four years can change so much yet still remain both grounded and fresh.",4,New Characters Invigorate Show,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2153,"['third', 'season', 'Friday', 'Night', 'Lights', 'show', 'still', 'interesting', 'had', 'hit', 'bit', 'dry', 'spell', 'many', 'characters', 'had', 'been', 'focal', 'points', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Smash', 'Williams', 'was', 'given', 'goodbye', 'Jason', 'Street', 'kind', 'just', 'faded', 'away', 'Tyra', 'Tim', 'were', 'given', 'same', 'dramatic', 'material', 'episode', 'episode', 'Thus', 'show', 'writers', 'introduced', 'new', 'characters', 'scenery', 'fourth', 'season', 'really', 'invigorated', 'show', 'needed', 'spark', 'really', 'continue', 'high', 'level.This', 'season', 'show', 'Coach', 'Taylor', 'now', 'coaching', 'East', 'Dillon', 'Lions', 'ragtag', 'football', 'program', 'barely', 'ground', 'switch', 'prestigious', 'West', 'Dillon', 'Panthers', 'be', 'sure', 'early', 'portion', 'season', 'enormous', 'change', 'effects', 'Taylor', 'family', 'Matt', 'Saracen', 'season', 'eventually', 'newcomers', 'including', '-The', 'two', 'stars', 'East', 'Dillon', 'Vince', 'Howard', 'Michael', 'B.', 'Jordan', 'youth', 'very', 'trouble', 'past', 'very', 'uncertain', 'future', 'Luke', 'Cafferty', 'Matt', 'Laurie', 'who', 'forced', 'transfer', 'West-to-East', 'due', 'dishonesty', 'football', 'boosters.-Jess', 'Merriweather', 'Jurnee', 'Smollett', 'who', 'shares', 'feelings', 'Vince', 'Landry', 'meeting', 'fate', 'bring', 'together.-Becky', 'Sproles', 'Dora', 'Madison', 'Burge', 'who', 'intriguing', 'relationship', 'Tim', 'Riggins.All', 'new', 'characters', 'add', 'emotional', 'punch', 'show', 'had', 'been', 'missing', 'honesty', 'midway', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'issues', 'individuals', 'such', 'rotating', 'evolving', 'cast', 'formula', 'up', 'working', 'out', 'very', 'well.Overall', 'then', 'consider', 'fourth', 'season', 'FNL', 'have', 'been', 'rousing', 'success', 'third', 'season', 'had', 'dropped', '3-star', 'territory', 'campaign', 'injected', 'new', 'life', 'proceedings', 'really', 'sucked', 'pretty', 'different', 'plotlines', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'how', 'show', 'been', 'set', 'same', 'basic', 'place', 'Dillon', 'TX', 'four', 'years', 'can', 'change', 'so', 'much', 'still', 'remain', 'grounded', 'fresh']",N/A
