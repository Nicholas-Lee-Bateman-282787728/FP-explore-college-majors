It seemed like these guys asked questions on a particular topic, then we hear only 3-4 responses from other people. I feel that this video would be good for younger teenagers, not so much for older audiences. I myself am a Christian who has grown up in America but has spent most of my 20s in Europe. Having lived in both worlds, it's been my experience that American Christians tend to be more ""by the book,"" whereas European Christians tend to be more laid back (just my personal experience). They tend to have different mindsets when it comes to some of the issues brought up in this video, and I was hoping to see more of that.

Long,"[0, 0]","This is a very modern, ""real"" look at what it means to follow Jesus as a young person in this culture we live in (American culture - this is definitely directed at the American audience). Basically you follow the real adventures of a group of 4 Christian college guys that went on a trip across Europe to discover more about what it means to follow Jesus. It's filmed by them as a sort of modern reality documentary.The result is very engaging and fascinating. I would say this is pretty much a ""must see"" for any Christian young person aged 12 to 25 or so. Subjects like materialism/greed, entertainment choices, sex, even church itself, are covered in a way where you see both the guys themselves, and by extension, you the viewer, having to come to grips with what it means to live as a Christ follower in a way that the world sees you are different from them.Not every thing the guys say or do is spot on theologically - you are after all watching a bunch of college-age guys trying to come to grips with how to live out their faith. I didn't agree with everything said, but it's all portrayed more as a ""dialogue"" - a ""discussion"" - and it is certainly great to promote discussion. This is something that I would say most every church youth group should consider showing their youth and then dialoguing with them about. In fact, I would think a great way to do it in this context would be to split up the different subjects that are covered and show each part that covers one subject - and then break for discussion. This could be done over a series of several weeks with each week being a different part of the film.The title ""Beware of Christians"" is based on the premise that one of the most dangerous things in our world is Christians - or people who call themselves Christians anyway - living just like the world so that there is no distinction. The net purpose of this movie is to try to stir young people to examine themselves and make a commitment to live different as a follower of Christ.As alluded to, the ideal age range for this film is in the jr. high/high/college age-crowd. Adults can certainly watch and get something out of it, but you will definitely not be confused that you are watching a bunch of college guys with their level of maturity (or lack thereof). Yet, the underlying themes and issues discussed are worthwhile for all ages. I personally don't care for the ""fake cussing"" which occurs throughout this movie where the guys say things like ""gosh darnit"", but this isn't a major issue with me and certainly I did a lot of that when I was in their age range as a Christian also.Again, as a real-life examination of what it means to follow Jesus as a young person, this is a very helpful film and I know of no other one really like it out there.Chris LongMoviesForChristians Movie Reviewsmoviesforchristians dot org",5,Great for youth groups and young Christians,1358553600,"01 19, 2013",2013,2847,"['very', 'modern', 'real', 'look', 'what', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'young', 'person', 'culture', 'live', 'American', 'culture', 'definitely', 'directed', 'American', 'audience', 'Basically', 'follow', 'real', 'adventures', 'group', '4', 'Christian', 'college', 'guys', 'went', 'trip', 'Europe', 'discover', 'more', 'what', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'filmed', 'sort', 'modern', 'reality', 'documentary.The', 'result', 'very', 'engaging', 'fascinating', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'much', 'must', 'see', 'Christian', 'young', 'person', 'aged', '12', '25', 'so', 'Subjects', 'materialism/greed', 'entertainment', 'choices', 'sex', 'even', 'church', 'are', 'covered', 'way', 'where', 'see', 'guys', 'extension', 'viewer', 'having', 'come', 'grips', 'what', 'live', 'Christ', 'follower', 'way', 'world', 'are', 'different', 'them.Not', 'thing', 'guys', 'say', 'do', 'spot', 'theologically', 'are', 'watching', 'bunch', 'college-age', 'guys', 'trying', 'come', 'grips', 'how', 'live', 'out', 'faith', 'did', ""n't"", 'agree', 'everything', 'said', 'portrayed', 'more', 'dialogue', 'discussion', 'certainly', 'great', 'promote', 'discussion', 'something', 'would', 'say', 'most', 'church', 'youth', 'group', 'should', 'consider', 'showing', 'youth', 'then', 'dialoguing', 'about', 'fact', 'would', 'think', 'great', 'way', 'do', 'context', 'would', 'be', 'split', 'up', 'different', 'subjects', 'are', 'covered', 'show', 'part', 'one', 'subject', 'then', 'break', 'discussion', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'series', 'several', 'weeks', 'week', 'being', 'different', 'part', 'film.The', 'title', 'Beware', 'Christians', 'based', 'premise', 'one', 'most', 'dangerous', 'things', 'world', 'Christians', 'people', 'who', 'call', 'Christians', 'anyway', 'living', 'just', 'world', 'so', 'distinction', 'net', 'purpose', 'movie', 'try', 'stir', 'young', 'people', 'examine', 'make', 'commitment', 'live', 'different', 'follower', 'Christ.As', 'alluded', 'ideal', 'age', 'range', 'film', 'jr.', 'high/high/college', 'age-crowd', 'Adults', 'can', 'certainly', 'watch', 'get', 'something', 'will', 'definitely', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'are', 'watching', 'bunch', 'college', 'guys', 'level', 'maturity', 'lack', 'thereof', 'underlying', 'themes', 'issues', 'discussed', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'ages', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'fake', 'cussing', 'movie', 'where', 'guys', 'say', 'things', 'gosh', 'darnit', ""n't"", 'major', 'issue', 'certainly', 'did', 'lot', 'when', 'was', 'age', 'range', 'Christian', 'also.Again', 'real-life', 'examination', 'what', 'follow', 'Jesus', 'young', 'person', 'very', 'helpful', 'film', 'know', 'other', 'one', 'really', 'out', 'there.Chris', 'LongMoviesForChristians', 'Movie', 'Reviewsmoviesforchristians', 'dot', 'org']",N/A

1502531,A3UUGZRTBS81YN,B005SJ0878,David W. Jones,"[10, 11]","This is the second movie made by college student Will Bakke and his friends.  In the first movie,One Nation Under God, the quartet drives all over the United States (and part of Canada) to find out what it means to be a Christian in today's culture.  They ask people they meet along the way what they think of Jesus and Christians.  The answers are quite revealing.  These vignettes are interspersed with their own musings, as they wrestle with what part of their evangelical upbringing is truly essential for following Christ, and what part is merely the trappings of the evangelical subculture.  Good stuff.In this movie, Bakke and three friends (two are different than the first movie) do the same thing, only now in Europe.  They hit many major European cities on their quest for authenticity.  There is a great deal of soul searching, but also multiple instances of four college guys clowning around on a road trip, which adds some humor to the documentary.  The second movie lives up to the standard set by the first one, and in some ways supersedes it.I recommend this movie for people who want to explore what it is like to live as a Christian in today's world--not the within the ""bubble"" of evangelical Christianity, but out there in the ""real world.""  Youth leaders will want to show this to their high school students before they go off to college.

1502541,A2O8FS9MZMBX7C,B005SJ0878,Rodger Dodger,"[2, 2]","After a trying-too-hard-to-be-hip round of introductions, I got really excited about the premise of this movie. These 4 college guys, who had been immersed in a homogeneous American culture their entire upbringing, were setting off to Europe to challenge the faith of their upbringing from the perspective of those who were not indoctrinated into it, in this case a mostly secular Europe.What a great movie that would have been.Instead, these boys challenged none of the preconceived ideas they were taught. The biggest problem - which many of the glowing reviews on here will see as an asset - is that they never put the Bible down or leave their American worldview enough to actually perceive reality from a different perspective. Aside from some wild partying and sight seeing, they may as well have stayed home. This is the type of global travel that will appeal to the people from Waco and Dallas and other places mentioned in the film who aren't really comfortable outside the rather isolated culture they already know. To such people, checking off a few landmarks and preaching their culture counts as global travel.Their interviews with people who allegedly have different views were very brief snippets that seemed more like a set-up to wink to their base back home (vulnerable high school kids still in the bubble of mental conditioning their upbringing created) and then condemn those people behind closed doors. They find comfort in talking to American tourists or a few others who share their beliefs. Such interviews are longer and go into deeper discussions not because anyone involved is right, but because this is the boys' comfort zone and they really aren't ready to move outside of it.At one point, they are interviewing two average looking young people who they are almost sure will tell them what they want to hear about how it's okay to have sex outside marriage, when two Hasidic Jews walk right past in the background and the boys ignore them. Imagine what those devoutly religious people could teach these naive young men! Or imagine if they tracked down mystics or Buddhist monks or indigenous shamans who have gone to frontiers far beyond what any mega-church can offer.When you experience people with those advanced insights, as I have, you are forced to really consider the laundry list of dos and don'ts that define much of ""religion"" today.In another interview about alcohol, two interviewees say their Christian friends drink as much as everyone else but their Muslim friend abstains because of her faith. Rather than exploring why a Muslim might be living more ""biblically"" than these hard-partying college boys (yes, they party hard in the movie), the boy conducting the interview blows right past the comment and redirects her back to talking about Christians. Another missed opportunity for him to learn something.At the Vatican, the depth of their exploration of Catholicism is to sit on steps alone and complain about the wealth of the Catholic Church. One of the more ignorant comments you'll hear is one of the boys actually saying Jesus didn't come to start a religion, which is ultimately true but, given their idolotry of the Bible they quote throughout, they fail to quote that part of the Bible where Jesus tells Peter to, you know, start the Catholic Church. Clearly, the ""Biblical"" learning they got growing up was selective - ignoring all the passages in the Bible that praise slavery, murder, rape, child abuse, incest, or Jesus requesting a church different from their own be started.These guys are so naive to the world around them that one of them even says every older married person he knows claims to regret sex before marriage. I suspect most older people he knows have been conditioned into the same culture he proselytizes throughout. Most adults enjoy various sexual experiences before settling down; it makes their true love lives so much better.Nevertheless, aside from the misleading deception at the heart of this movie, by which I mean these boys pretended to be open-minded then simply used the trip to proselytize the tired tropes they were raised to believe, these guys at the entry-level of spirituality do find a promising first step by the end. They have some decent insights about religion and its role. They recognize it's not about just following rules but rather about embodying a presence, and they make very apt criticisms of the faith of their upbringing.Contrary to the conservative politics that have grown in recent years to dominate their cultural upbringing, they do seem to recognize a need to take care of the poor and that simple charity is not enough to do that on a sufficiently large enough scale. It would be interesting to see how that evolves into their future political views, as it stands in contrast to what most adults in their world believe (even the ones who receive public assistance).That's all a good first step toward enlightenment. Perhaps it's not time yet in their spiritual journey to leave their idolotry of the Bible behind.Hopefully, their next journey will actually address the original premise of this one. Hopefully they will drop the Bible that was compiled centuries after Christ with content voted upon by very powerful political men, release all they have been taught to be true, and immerse themselves in learning other spiritual traditions around the world, as well as the frontiers of science. Then, and only then, will they awaken to the mystical core of Christ, a wisdom that goes far beyond any text.",2,A deceptive premise but the boys found their own first step,1393977600,"03 5,

(they went to Europe to specifically seek out different opinions), and acting like idiots.  They had no plan when they went (or it was such a failure that they scrapped it and went without it) which made it worse b/c we got to see a lot about how they were stuck without passports or missed the train.  Then there was the religious talk.  Very, very basic.  Sunday school stuff.  I felt like they were trying to do something mainstream enough to reach a big audience, but not tackle the issues too deeply so they didn't offend anyone.
