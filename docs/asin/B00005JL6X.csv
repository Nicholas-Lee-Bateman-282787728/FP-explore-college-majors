Being a television series that spans four hours, Red Rose effectively takes care of that problem, giving us sympathetic, and believable (to an extent) characters.However, one must remember that given its a TV series, its special effects are at times less than spectacular, and that is one of its few detractors, a superficial argument that most critics would use in arguing against this film.For me, I personally thoroughly enjoyed the film. Being broadcast direct to your television, director Baxley must have realized that the shocks which has plagued most of today's movies would be rendered ineffective, thus giving us a good old fashioned horror movie much in the vein of 1963's The Haunting, the book on which its based ironically is referenced (along with House on Haunted Hill) on the miniseries.Although it does seem to drag along on several occasions, it is one heck of an unbelievably terrifying ride, and balances terror with humor excellently. I found it so enjoyable, that the first time I saw it was after I had bought the DVD, and sat watching the four hour long picture, engrossed and on the edge of my seat the entire time.The plot is rather simple, and follows the traditional 'haunted-house' formula: a house with a bad reputation is wanted by an eccentric person, and tagging along for the ride is the house owner, and the guests, who in this case turn out to be psychics, each with their own special powers.Without giving too much away, I'll just say that things go awry, as they always do. Definetly worth a watch for people tired of the jump-a-second movies being spewed en-masse in todays Cinema.

Brown, David Dukes, Matt Ross, Julian Sands and Kevin Tighe.IMDb synopsis""Dr. Joyce Reardon, a psychology professor, leads a team of psychics into the decrepit mansion known as Rose Red. Her efforts unleash the spirit of former owner Ellen Rimbauer and uncover the horrifying secrets of those who lived and died there.""Each of these psychics has a special power: for one it's ESP, another touches things, goes into a trance and speaks as someone related to the object. Most remarkable of all is Annie Wheaton (Brown), a young teen with incredibly strong telekinesis ability. She can also make things appear or cause music to blare from open lilies. It's Annie that Dr. Reardon is counting on to awaken Red Rose from its current ""dead cell"" state, and it looks like this autistic child won't let her down.Since 1950, this compound of uninhabited gothic-looking buildings has been slowly expanding on its own. Untended for a quarter-century, the grounds are overrun with a forest of plant life, roots and vines, some of it quite dead, which adds to an already creepy atmosphere that includes a pervasive ground mist.Everywhere is a sense of a surrounding evil, forces that have in the past killed men and caused women to vanish forever. Visitors to Red Rose are being watched, but by who...or what?... and their safety is not guaranteed.Running time, approx. 4 hrs. 10 mins.

595830,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005JL6X,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[5, 8]","Who doesn't love a good haunted house movie?. I'm always game for that as long as it is done right. This three part T.V. mini-series gets it half right. It doesn't hit on all the right spots that you'd want. This is an original story by Stephen King written specifically for the little screen. I believe this happened only one other time with &quot;Storm Of The Century&quot;. With King writing, you would of expected something a bit better. Here we go. Nancy Travis stars as Dr. Joyce Reardon, a professor who was once respected but is now sort of regarded as a joke since she has gone into the paranormal. Sort of like Agent Scully on &quot;The X Files&quot; in a way. She plans on going on an expedition to the Rimbauer house in Seattle. A big, scary, victorian like mansion that is supposedly haunted. She brings along a team of people, each with their own power, to the house. But, the one thing she needs is a telekinetic little girl named Annie(played by Kimberly J. Brown)who she believes is the one with the power to awaken the ghosts within. As the movie goes along, it's clear that Joyce has other intentions. I have to say the movie looks good and is filmed sharply. The flashback scenes showing the origin of the house and it's owners was nicely done. Most of the characters are very good and well thought out. The performances from the cast are very good, but with a few exceptions. Kimberly Brown as Annie just does the quiet, odd little girl routine. It is a strictly 'by the numbers' performance. Nancy Travis seems to be very wrongly cast in role of Joyce Reardon. She just doesn't ring true. Matt Ross is the best of the bunch really making his character the best. And then there is David Dukes. He plays his professor character with the most arrogant, pompus scene stealing bravado he could muster. He does it very well. One of the better cast members. Sadly, he passed away halfway thru filming from a heart attack. A stand in came in and doubled for him for the remainder of his scenes. You can really tell it's the stand in too. The thing that really ruins this movie is the fact that it's a 3 part mini-series. There is so much padding in the movie that is dampers the whole thing. We are talking four hours or so without commercials. The good stuff that is really good and effective is long forgotten in between scenes that it doesn't hold any lasting effect. The movie would of benefited better if it were a shorter, normal movie. The effects are adequate, but the flying ghost at the end was laughably bad. The make-up is okay, but nothing over the top incredible. It is a very entertaining movie, don't get me wrong, but it is stretched so thin that it nearly vanishes before your very eyes. We expected something stronger and more long lasting from King. &quot;Rose Red&quot; isn't his best venture into T.V., that honor goes to his re-working of &quot;The Shining&quot; a few years ago, but it is a decent effort. It had the potential and talent behind it to of been so much better. The cast includes some familiar faces like Kevin Tighe(&quot;K-9&quot;, &quot;What's Eating Gilbert Grape&quot;), Julian Sands(&quot;Warlock&quot;, &quot;Arachnophobia&quot;), Matt Kesslar(&quot;Scream 3&quot;), and Judith Ivey(&quot;Designing Women&quot;).

595834,AIMR915K4YCN,B00005JL6X,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","With ROSE RED, Stephen King treads on sacred ground. The ancient idea of psychic investigators staying in a haunted house was expertly done in the film version of THE HAUNTING (in the early 60s), and also, though not quite as well, in THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (in the early 70s). King knows this, and does his best to deviate from the tried-and-true formula. Unfortunately, ROSE RED is a TV mini-series, and as such, had to be several hours in length. This means that what should have been a 90-120 minute story was stretched out to over four bloated, tedious hours! My god! Don't people understand what King does w/ too much time, or too many pages to work with? Have they not read THE TALISMAN? Steve will ALWAYS fill as much time / space as he is allowed, resulting in... well, ROSE RED.

There's no direct sense of how exactly the house is evil, just that it perturbs, distorts, and manipulates it's inhabitants into insanity through visions and hallucinations.  That, and the house expands *itself* infinitely (easy to get lost in and no one knows the count of the rooms).  This is the cause of everyone's death through Rose Red (I'm sure you saw this one coming).EG - One person sees statues moving and has a heart attack.  He would have survived if he could get into the house, but all the doors and windows are mysteriously locked.  The only person who sees him is convinced that he is a hallucination (due to the house OD'ing everyone on them), and refuses to submit to it.  Meanwhile, the woman who brought this psychic group there is too obsessed with the house (it is a pretty bad@$$ English Manor) to let a pesky thing like death get in the way of her studies of it, namely of the super-psychic kid who eventually tames the house.

The only good thing that can be said about it is that it is opulent in sets and cinematography, and has some pretty good special effects.As for the rest...That the plot is hackneyed is a matter of small consequence  -  a team of psychic researchers spend some time in a famously haunted house, seeking answers to the paranormal  -  but the story not only doesn't do anything original, it actually does everything that has come before in the haunted house genre worse.  The running joke of the show is that the parapsychologist leading the expedition to Rose Red wants to nail ironclad proof of the supernatural to stun the scientific community  -  yet one of the psychics she has with her makes objects fly around rooms at will, the haunted house changes its architecture before her very eyes (and the eyes of a half dozen witnesses and a loaded camera), and the house supposedly builds entire wings onto itself when no one is looking (which should make proof of the supernatural no harder than demonstrating that no work crews have been there since the house was finished).Worse than these logical absurdities, however, are the characters, not a single one of whom acts like an adult even when over-the-top pyrotechnics aren't occurring.  They squabble like junior high school students, plotting petty juvenile revenge against each other and continually playing baiting games that are beneath even fourteen-year-olds.  A major plot point (it takes up most of the last installment) concerns the house being able to hold its visitors prisoner solely because one psychic little girl remains conscious  -  the characters actually debate killing her, when simply waiting for her to fall asleep or, at worst, temporarily rendering her unconscious would suffice.  And what makes that even worse is that the little girl is about the only really likeable character of the lot.  The transitions of the characters are not believable  -  they simply act like children, pretty well throughout.What makes all this more amazing is that the man who attached his name to this embarrassingly awful piece is the same man who wrote The Shining, one of the best haunted house stories available.

I was quite surprised at this venture as King is famous for very slowly building up tension. Rose Red is one of the very few things he's done that opens with a bang, slows down a bit as we get to know the characters and the environ, and then just doesn't stop. As I live in Europe, I never saw the mini-series, but rented the double DVD which is some five and a half hours long. I watched the entire thing from beginning to end three times and just bought it. I think it is the best SK production to date. Not the best script or story, that stays with The Stand, but the best production. The story is, I think, a bit lame, but so what? It's a haunted house story, it's aim is to scare us, and it works quite well on that level. The DVD, at least the one available in Europe, is a good one, with a pseudo-documentary of the history of Rose Red as well as a documentary of the building of the sets, which are really fabulous. It's just great fun, well-acted (well, Julian Sands!) and very well produced, the house itself is great eye-candy, and, it even has a bit of a moral imperative.No question, The Haunting of Hill House is THE haunted house movie, as I'm sure even Stephen King would agree. (And we can see the Hill House influences on Rose Red) But that doesn't mean that this one isn't very good as well.(Oh yeah, why not five stars rather than four?

This is simply so that everyone will know what they are getting into from the very beginning, not because I have anything against long movies per se, just long movies that are way too long.There are several things wrong with Rose Red, but the main ones involve its relationship to previous Stephen King works. There is much familiar in this production, with references to Carrie, The Shining, Firestarter, and a tip of the hat to Cujo being the most obvious. Unfortunately, these references seem to be just there in order to move along an already-thin plot, not leaving a lot to recommend it.Nancy Travis (The Vanishing) is sorely miscast as paranormal researcher Joyce Reardon (the supposed author of book tie-in The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer); she just doesn't have the presence to be believable in such an academically passionate role. The usually-wonderful Judith Ivey is ill-used in a histrionic performance.On the other hand, soap veteran Kimberley J. Brown knows just how to wring every last bit of sympathy from the audience in her role as Annie Wheaton, the catalyst meant to ""wake up"" the events at Rose Red. Her sister, ""Sister,"" is played by Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures), who, despite her relatively small role, fares the best of all the cast. Matt Ross and the late David Dukes are both quite game in their roles (Emery Waterman and Professor Miller, respectively), but Dukes' character is one-note (sad to think it was his last role) and Ross' acting crescendos throughout the film from ""subtle"" to ""absolutely annoying.""After about two hours of exposition, the plot actually begins to move a bit, but it is always slowly and it is not worth the lackluster ""inspirational"" ending. For a horror movie, far too many of the cast survive; if more than two or three people are left at the end of a ""haunted house thriller,"" the audience has been cheated.

595848,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JL6X,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[35, 49]","No one admires or idolizes Stephen King more than I do, but Stephen King's Rose Red falls quite short of becoming the ultimate haunted house movie.  There's really nothing frightening about it, for one thing.  For a six hour miniseries (which equates to just over four hours viewing time on DVD), the characterization is rather spotty, some of the casting is questionable, insufficient background information is provided, and all of the elements in this expanded story production fail to click.  There is nowhere near enough blood and gore for my liking, but of course one has to always remember that this was a made-for-TV miniseries and not an R rated theatrical motion picture - there is a nice finger-chopping scene, though.  The viewing experience on DVD is much better than the original miniseries experience, I might point out (although the video quality is surprisingly shaky).  It basically took the first night of the miniseries for things to really get going, and now one can plunge right into the heart of the story without delay; what little sustained creepiness is to be found inside the walls of Rose Red works much better without the handicap of commercial interruption.  This does lead to some soap opera moments, however, in those spaces that lead up to the original commercial breaks.  I think the real weakness of the film, though, is the ending, as it comes across as somewhat contrived; it certainly does not satisfy this viewer.Initially, we spend some time meeting the central characters in this drama; I say &quot;meeting&quot; because I never felt as if I actually &quot;got to know&quot; more than two or three of them.  Nancy Travis plays Dr. Joyce Reardon, a scientist obsessed with proving the existence of the paranormal.  Despite the harassment she receives from her boss Professor Miller (David Dukes), she goes ahead with a scientific investigation of Seattle's supposedly haunted mansion Rose Red, intending to wake up what she perceives is a dormant cell and thereby gain the proof she seeks that spirits do exist.  She assembles a most unusual team of helpers, each of them psychic in one way or another (mind reading, post-cognition, automatic writing, etc.).  The key, though, is the teenaged Annie Wheaton (Kimberly J. Brown), an autistic youth with a proven track record of psychokinetic powers (e.g., pummeling a neighbor's house with large boulders out of the sky a la Carrie White).  The only really interesting characters besides Annie and Dr. Reardon are Steven Rimbauer, the last living descendant of the Rimbauers and sole owner of Rose Red (as well as Dr. Reardon's lover) and Emery Waterman (Matt Ross).  Emery sees dead people, is burdened with a mother who is exceedingly overprotective and a compulsive shopper, and whines and complains to beat the band.Naturally, weird things begin to happen, we piece together more of the story of the house, and eventually individuals start wandering around alone basically begging to die.  Frayed nerves are snapped like rubber bands, and a few ghostly manifestations appear in zombie fashion from time to time to assist new victims of the house to their untimely deaths.  Needless to say, Reardon and her team are trapped inside the house.  A couple of other related characters find their way on the land to meet a most unkind fate, and eventually final resolution comes in a rather silly manner.I'm just not sure that Nancy Travis was the right actress to play Dr. Reardon, but there are also problems with the character she plays. Fairly early on in the film, for instance, Reardon has a confrontation with Dr. Miller, and this scene as it played out had a negative impact on my enjoyment of the film as a whole.  David Dukes, the man who played Dr. Miller, died tragically during the filming, leaving behind a great performance of a despicable character.  I liked Annie, and I make a point to say this because King movies all too often feature young characters so incredibly annoying that you have to hate them.  King himself makes another great cameo appearance in the film, which is all the more remarkable considering the after effects of the relatively recent accident which almost killed him.The only important bonus features on the DVD are two documentaries.  The Making of Rose Red is good and quite informative, but at fifty minutes it seems to drag on forever.  It is certainly worth watching, though, for the Stephen King interview clips if nothing else.  Then there is a half-hour feature on The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer; this is a promotional fake documentary ABC put out shortly before the airing of the miniseries itself.  It presents the story of the house and the investigation as fact, trying to create the idea in potential viewers' heads that the miniseries was to have strong elements of truth in it, which it does not.  If you have never seen Rose Red, I would actually recommend watching this feature before taking in the film itself, as it offers valuable (though still incomplete) information on the background of the house.",3,Rose Red comes with many a thorn of disappointment,1067990400,"11 5, 2003",2003,5042,"['one', 'idolizes', 'Stephen', 'King', 'more', 'do', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Rose', 'Red', 'quite', 'short',

When she got her proof, she wanted more. Why, I don't know. I guess she wanted to unlock more secrets of the place, and folks dying kind of took a back seat to that hunger. But WHY? Why was she so obsessed?We'll never know, I suppose. Her acting was miserable. The acting of David Dukes (rest his soul) was miserable.

First I thought the story was creppy, but the visual effects were not all the good, and he could not add the images of people getting killed which he is known for, so that kind of took that away from the film. If it was done on HBO or Showtime, then it could of been different because it would show the blood, the gore, and everything that makes a good Stephen King novel, well a Stephen King novel. Also they could of add some of King's humor, but sometimes his humor is kind of obscene, but it is funny nonetheless.It is a good movie to see, but it is just better to rent it at Blockbuster, or your local library.",3,I felt this could of been better,1069372800,"11 21, 2003",2003,695,"['LOVE', 'Stephen', 'King', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Rose', 'Red', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'First', 'thought', 'story', 'was', 'creppy', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'good', 'could', 'not', 'add', 'images', 'people', 'getting', 'killed', 'known', 'kind', 'took', 'away', 'film', 'was', 'done', 'HBO', 'Showtime', 'then', 'could', 'been', 'different', 'would', 'show', 'blood', 'gore', 'everything', 'good', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'well', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'Also', 'could', 'add', 'King', 'humor', 'sometimes', 'humor', 'kind', 'obscene', 'funny', 'nonetheless.It', 'good', 'movie', 'see', 'just', 'better', 'rent', 'Blockbuster', 'local', 'library']",Rose Red [VHS]
595857,A3L2U581LL17EB,B00005JL6X,Eric,"[9, 12]","As far as haunted house flicks go, Rose Red is certainly better than most of what Hollywood has had to offer recently (The Haunting remake, Thir13een Ghosts).  Still, even though penned by Stephen King, this thriller misses out on some of its own potential and the film is occasionally hampered by its TV limitations (mostly in terms of blood and gore).The picture stars Matt Keeslar as Steven Rimbauer, the last descendant of the Rimbauer family, the builders and owners of the infamous Rose Red, a gigantic mansion purported to be haunted.  With his permission, an obsessed professor (Nancy Travis) rounds up a team of psychics to explore the mansion, and within they discover Rose Reds' secrets and terrors.So, basically, the story is pretty much what we've come to expect from a haunted house flick.  Just get a bunch of people together, put them in a house, and knock 'em off one-by-one.  This one's a bit better than you might expect, thanks to the great production values and decent acting (considering some of the bad dialogue, I'd say the performances are often pretty impressive).  As a matter of fact, I'd say this film works in spite of King, whose script offers nothing new to the genre and relies on stupidity from the characters to keep the plot moving (at one point, the group actually leaves a tied-up woman behind despite knowing full well what the house is capable of).Unsurprisingly, the film works best when it concentrates on quiet, creepy horror and the things that go bump in the night.  Thus, the second segment of this 254 minute (!) production is the strongest part of the film, offering much in the way of suspense and scares, but is unfortunately bookended by parts that either take too long to get moving (Part 1) or eventually succumb to silliness, which is exactly what occurs in the last fifteen minutes.But this miniseries (at least from the second part on to the end) held my attention, and I was delighted to see that I actually could not predict who would die in what order, so I guess King deserves some credit for that.  This is all fairly well orchestrated by director Craig R. Baxley, who's beginning to replace Mick Garris as King's filmmaker of choice.",3,Just barely worth spending the night.,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,2195,"['As', 'far', 'haunted', 'house', 'flicks', 'go', 'Rose', 'Red', 'certainly', 'better', 'most', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'offer', 'recently', 'Haunting', 'remake', 'Thir13een', 'Ghosts', 'Still', 'even', 'penned', 'Stephen', 'King', 'thriller', 'out', 'own', 'potential', 'film', 'occasionally', 'hampered', 'TV', 'limitations', 'mostly', 'terms', 'blood', 'gore', 'picture', 'stars', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'Steven', 'Rimbauer', 'last', 'descendant', 'Rimbauer', 'family', 'builders', 'owners', 'infamous', 'Rose', 'Red', 'gigantic', 'mansion', 'purported', 'be', 'haunted', 'permission', 'obsessed', 'professor', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'up', 'team', 'psychics', 'explore', 'mansion', 'discover', 'Rose', 'Reds', 'secrets', 'terrors.So', 'basically', 'story', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'haunted', 'house', 'flick', 'Just', 'get', 'bunch', 'people', 'together', 'put', 'house', 'knock', 'off', 'one-by-one', 'one', 'bit', 'better', 'might', 'expect', 'thanks', 'great', 'production', 'values', 'decent', 'acting', 'considering', 'bad', 'dialogue', ""'d"", 'say', 'performances', 'are', 'often', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'matter', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'film', 'spite', 'King', 'script', 'nothing', 'new', 'genre', 'relies', 'stupidity', 'characters', 'keep', 'plot', 'moving', 'one', 'point', 'group', 'actually', 'tied-up', 'woman', 'knowing', 'full', 'well', 'what', 'house', 'capable', '.Unsurprisingly', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'quiet', 'creepy', 'horror', 'things', 'go', 'bump', 'night', 'Thus', 'second', 'segment', '254', 'minute', 'production', 'strongest', 'part', 'film', 'offering', 'much', 'way', 'suspense', 'scares', 'unfortunately', 'bookended', 'parts', 'take', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'moving', 'Part', '1', 'eventually', 'succumb', 'silliness', 'exactly', 'what', 'last', 'fifteen', 'minutes.But', 'miniseries', 'least', 'second', 'part', 'end', 'held', 'attention', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'actually', 'could', 'not', 'predict', 'who', 'would', 'die', 'order', 'guess', 'King', 'deserves', 'credit', 'fairly', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'director', 'Craig', 'R.', 'Baxley', 'who', 'beginning', 'replace', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'King', 'filmmaker', 'choice']",Rose Red [VHS]

595860,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B00005JL6X,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[1, 1]","ROSE REDWhen this miniseries debuted back in 202 I believe I could not have been happier. Two of my favorite things were coming together, nay, three of my favorite things. Those things were Stephen King [as writer], haunted house [as the story and setting] and Julian Sands [as an actor] who I loved from the first two ""Warlock"" movies"". So naturally when it was airing I watched it every night and then when released on DVD I was right there to pick it up. So every once in a while when I come across it in the collection I have to watch it again. Being that it is October I thought why not right now, my lady loves it and I haven't seen it in a while so here we go.The story follows a professor named Joyce Reardon who is obsessed with a local mansion that is said to be haunted, Rose Red. She wants to lead a research team into the house and try to prove what most already believe, that the house is alive and indeed haunted. It got its reputation by being the site of some 23 deaths or disappearances, and also much like when the lady of the house was alive and constantly building the house seems to continue her wish of expansion even after death. Dr. Reardon and her team of psychics enter the house expecting something but what they get is much more than what the bargained for.Now I will admit that this is far from a perfect film and even being written by King himself it had to be toned down for TV. It was originally written as a feature film by king with Steven Spielberg on to produce; I guess he wanted to revisit something like ""Poltergeist"". But that didn't work out so years later here we were. I still wonder what that would have been like but any way what we did get was great. As far as TV miniseries go this is a fun one with a great cast. Nancy Travis was great as Joyce here would really wanted to prove ghosts are real so bad she is somewhat insane from the beginning. Matt Keeslar was good in the role of the houses sole survivor from the family, as was Melaine Lynskey as the character Annie's big sister. Speaking of Annie, Kimberly Brown was great in the role that was key to the story. In fact the entire cast was great but it was Matt Ross and Julian Sands that stole the show in my opinion. I have always liked Sands and knew he would be great in this but Ross was hands down my favorite here as Emery. From the first time I watched this film on TV even to now I always root for him even as his character is not the most likable to most people. But I felt like that character was the most realistic in the situation, as in that is the way I would be if I was there type of thing.Set in Seattle Washington the locations look great and add to the atmosphere. When you thing of haunted houses it is easy to picture them in a place that is rainy, cloudy, and very moody. Also the set designs are wonderful from the present all the way back to the flashbacks. In fact it is those period scenes that shine the brightest here, especially with the performances of Julia Campbell as the owner of the house and Tsidii Le Loka as her best friend. Loka in particular is very creepy throughout the film, especially when she invites a young man from the college in [you will see]. Those eyes in that scene are brilliant.Directed by Craig Baxley who also did other King mini-series's ""Storm of the Centaury"" [one of the all time best] and ""Kingdom Hospital"" along with this series' prequel film ""The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" this turned out to be a pretty fun film. It isn't the scariest thing out there but the characters and their interactions make this an entertaining watch. I do recommend this set to any King fan out there or any horror fan looking for something to pass the time on a weekend. I had fun with it all those years ago and still enjoy it now.",5,THE HOUSE THAT ELLEN BUILT,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",2013,3778,"['ROSE', 'REDWhen', 'miniseries', 'debuted', 'back', '202', 'believe', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'happier', 'Two', 'favorite', 'things', 'were', 'coming', 'together', 'nay', 'three', 'favorite', 'things', 'things', 'were', 'Stephen', 'King', '[', 'writer', ']', 'haunted', 'house', '[', 'story', 'setting', ']', 'Julian', 'Sands', '[', 'actor', ']', 'who', 'loved', 'first', 'two', 'Warlock', 'movies', 'So', 'naturally', 'when', 'was', 'airing', 'watched', 'night', 'then', 'when', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'pick', 'up', 'So', 'once', 'while', 'when', 'come', 'collection', 'have', 'watch', 'again', 'Being', 'October', 'thought', 'why', 'not', 'right', 'now', 'lady', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'while', 'so', 'here', 'go.The', 'story', 'professor', 'named', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'who', 'obsessed', 'local', 'mansion', 'said', 'be', 'haunted', 'Rose', 'Red', 'lead', 'research', 'team', 'house', 'try', 'prove', 'what', 'most', 'already', 'believe', 'house', 'alive', 'indeed', 'haunted', 'got', 'reputation', 'being', 'site', '23', 'deaths', 'disappearances', 'also', 'much', 'when', 'lady', 'house', 'was', 'alive', 'constantly', 'building', 'house', 'continue', 'wish', 'expansion', 'even', 'death', 'Dr.', 'Reardon', 'team', 'psychics', 'enter', 'house', 'expecting', 'something', 'what', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'what', 'bargained', 'for.Now', 'will', 'admit', 'far', 'perfect', 'film', 'even', 'being', 'written', 'King', 'had', 'be', 'toned', 'down', 'TV', 'was', 'originally', 'written', 'feature', 'film', 'king', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'produce', 'guess', 'wanted', 'revisit', 'something', 'Poltergeist', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'so', 'years', 'later', 'here', 'were', 'still', 'wonder', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'way', 'what', 'did', 'get', 'was', 'great', 'As', 'far', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'go', 'fun', 'one', 'great', 'cast', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'was', 'great', 'Joyce', 'here', 'would', 'really', 'wanted', 'prove', 'ghosts', 'are', 'real', 'so', 'bad', 'somewhat', 'insane', 'beginning', 'Matt', 'Keeslar', 'was', 'good', 'role', 'houses', 'sole', 'survivor', 'family', 'was', 'Melaine', 'Lynskey', 'character', 'Annie', 'big', 'sister', 'Speaking', 'Annie', 'Kimberly', 'Brown', 'was', 'great', 'role', 'was', 'key', 'story', 'fact', 'entire', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'was', 'Matt', 'Ross', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'stole', 'show', 'opinion', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Sands', 'knew', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'Ross', 'was', 'hands', 'down', 'favorite', 'here', 'Emery', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'film', 'TV', 'even', 'now', 'always', 'root', 'even', 'character', 'not', 'most', 'likable', 'most', 'people', 'felt', 'character', 'was', 'most', 'realistic', 'situation', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'was', 'type', 'thing.Set', 'Seattle', 'Washington', 'locations', 'look', 'great', 'add', 'atmosphere', 'When', 'thing', 'haunted', 'houses', 'easy', 'picture', 'place', 'rainy', 'cloudy', 'very', 'moody', 'Also', 'set', 'designs', 'are', 'wonderful', 'present', 'way', 'back', 'flashbacks', 'fact', 'period', 'scenes', 'shine', 'brightest', 'here', 'especially', 'performances', 'Julia', 'Campbell', 'owner', 'house', 'Tsidii', 'Le', 'Loka', 'best', 'friend', 'Loka', 'particular', 'very', 'creepy', 'film', 'especially', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'college', '[', 'will', 'see', ']', 'eyes', 'scene', 'are', 'brilliant.Directed', 'Craig', 'Baxley', 'who', 'also', 'did', 'other', 'King', 'mini-series', 'Storm', 'Centaury', 'one', 'time', 'best', ']', 'Kingdom', 'Hospital', 'series', 'prequel', 'film', 'Diary', 'Ellen', 'Rimbauer', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'pretty', 'fun', 'film', ""n't"", 'scariest', 'thing', 'there', 'characters', 'interactions', 'make', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'do', 'recommend', 'set', 'King', 'fan', 'there', 'horror', 'fan', 'looking', 'something', 'pass', 'time', 'weekend', 'had', 'fun', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'enjoy', 'now']",Rose Red [VHS]

595862,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00005JL6X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[0, 0]","Stephen King has always been an extremely derrivative writer, and much of his work arises from the influence of two novels by Shirley Jackson: THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and WE HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN THE CASTLE; he also also often draws an elemenent or two from the novel and film THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE.  Interestingly, for ROSE RED he not only draws from these usual sources, but from his own earlier works as well, most specifically CARRIE, 'SALEM'S LOT, and THE SHINING.According to King and other sources, the story for ROSE RED was suggested by the famous Winchester ""Mystery"" House built by Sarah Winchester, widow of gun manufacturer William Wirt Winchester.  Convinced that she was cursed by the deaths caused by her husbands product, she supposedly consulted a medium who told her that she must build a house for the spirits of those who had died by her husband's product--and that if she ever stopped building the house she herself would die.  She accordingly purchased a parcle of land in what is now San Jose, California, where she employed an army of workers who worked on the house for the next thirty-eight years.  Work ended when Mrs. Winchester died in 1922.ROSE RED was originally conceived as a motion picture to be directed by Stephen Spielberg, but Speilberg eventually passed on the project, which then went to ABC television network as a three part mini-series directed by Craig R. Baxley, who had worked with King on the mini-series STORM OF THE CENTURY.  Final running time, without commercials was 254 minutes, and although some sources state it was originally presented in four parts, it was actually presented in three.  Critical reception was very mixed but the series was a rating smash.The basic story concerns Dr. Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis), a professor specializing in parapsyhology who is so fascinated by an infamously haunted house named ""Rose Red"" that she essentially seduces the one living heir into an affair--and into giving her access to the house over a Memorial Day weekend.  Reardon, who is attacked for her beliefs in the supernatural by other faculty, takes a group of people with her to the house to make an investigation.  With the exception of heir Steven Rimbauer (Matt Kessler), they are all in some way psychic.  The most important of these is autistic teenager Annie (Kimberly J. Brown), who is accompanied by her sister Rachel (Melanie Lynskey) and who is generally thought have extraordinary psyhic abilities. Dr. Reardon hopes that Annie's abilities, as well as the various powers of the others, will awaken the house, which has long been dormant.  She succeeds beyond her wildest dreams.  The death toll in ROSE RED is extremely high, with only five of the major characters surviving the experience and seven dying or being consumed by the house in various unpleasant ways.The film is a bit slow to start, for it requires considerable exposition: who Dr. Reardon and what her position is; who Annie is and what her past is; and a fairly detailed explanation of how the house came to be built and a sketch of its extremely unsavory past, which includes everything from apparently accidental decapitation to simple disappearance.  Once the party goes to the house, however, the pace picks up considerably--and so do the special effects, which are quite good.  Although the shocks and jolts aren't quite as frightening as you might wish, the whole thing is quite a lot of fun: the house seems to expand at will, and frequently leads people astray by suddenly installing a different room or a hallway where there was previously none.  There are mirrored floors, exploding windows, showers of stones, electrical disturbances, walking corpses, and all sorts of unpleasant apparitions until the survivors make the startling discovery that the house is feeding from Annie's abilities and that the least likely member of their party, Kathy Kramer (Judith Ivey), holds the key to communication with the child.The cast is a mixed bag, with some a shade too over the top--but given the story line it really is hard to say what is too much and what isn't.  I was particularly impressed with Judith Ivey, who played in a low key manner until the script threw her into truly hellish situations, which she then played with considerable ""horror movie"" expertese.  The DVD consists of two disks, the second one with a number of fairly entertaining bonus materials (including a pseudo-documentary on Rose Red.  My one technical complaint is that the sound balance is not always what it should be: the background music has the habit of not staying in the background and thereby overpowering moments in the dialogue.  But all in all, this is a fun movie, certainly too disturbing for the under-twelve crowd, but every watchable for teenages and adults.

A psychology professor named Joyce Reardon is endlessly intrigued by the myth of the house and gets together a team of psychics to come to the house for one weekend and wake it up.I loved all the acting here. Nancy Travis plays Joyce very well. Some people have complained about her performance, but how would you rather have her played? Completely sane and level headed? The beauty of her character comes from its own words: When a person is confronted with something paranormal, then tend to protect their beliefs ferociously. All she wants is that proof. She got it on the first day, sure, but knowing her character, did you obviously think a person so set in her beliefs would leave before the end of the weekend. Joyce was dead set on proving Professor Miller and the other doubters wrong. She didn't just want proof. She wanted as much proof as she could get.Kimberly Brown is excellent as Annie, who is my personal favorite character. Brown has played other roles, including a Disney Channel movie and some small roles, but I think that if I saw those, I wouldn't like them as much after seeing her in this. She is so radiant and talented in this role, and I hope she continues to edge into, if not more grown-up roles, at least roles in more grown up movies.Julian Sands said in the documentary that he hoped that his character simply came off as a sexy, charismatic guy, and he is incredibly charming. You can't take your eyes off him when he's speaking. Even when he gestures, or is just standing there, he maintains that characteristic persona. No matter how bad you think the acting is, at least they all stayed in character throughout the movie.This is an excellent miniseries, and I would love to see even more Stephen King after this. I have seen many haunted house movies, and more than my share of science fiction and fantasy, with a little horror and suspense.

595871,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JL6X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","In this mini-series Stephen King is not the original author and he remained faithful to the original book. And the result shows. The special effects, the general treatment and processing of all situations are perfect and very impressive, though not necessarily frightening. Stephen King tries hard to avoid gross elements and also tries hard to remain within the limits of decency. So we are not gripped in our tripe or gut and we remain intellectually active. The special effects then are an object of study and consideration, not a frightening element. The house itself is beautiful and the actors are quite good. The rhythm is slow, since it is a miniseries, hence video art and not cinema and that too gives time to develop a situation. The only real situational element is the conflict between the head of the  expedition  and the head of her department. The conflict leads to an interesting characterisation of university department heads as blockheads and narrow-minded, not to say blind, people. Stephen King also develops the characterization of the six psychics who take part in the expedition. There we have a lot of humor and it is even funny. And yet the house does not find a kingian dimension because the evil that lives in it is not identified in its deepest roots and hence in  its most frightening dimension : fear comes from within the viewer and not from outside. If the viewer cannot identify himself with one character or one situation he is not going to be frightened or it will only be superficial and in no way time-enduring. Decently we cannot identify with this enormous house because we are not a house and because we cannot ever dream to have or have had such a fancy house. We remain outsiders in the film. We may identify with the explorers, and yet even so they are shown as different, as abnormal in many ways and we cannot project our normal selves into them. It is a shame because the house was obviously built along many lines we can recognize here and there on models that come from many films, some of them horror films. But the magic of horror is not there.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne",4,Good but not chilling,1138838400,"02 2, 2006",2006,2203,"['mini-series', 'Stephen', 'King', 'not', 'original', 'author', 'remained', 'faithful', 'original', 'book', 'result', 'special', 'effects', 'general', 'treatment', 'processing', 'situations', 'are', 'perfect', 'very', 'impressive', 'not', 'necessarily', 'frightening', 'Stephen', 'King', 'hard', 'avoid', 'gross', 'elements', 'also', 'hard', 'remain', 'limits', 'decency', 'are', 'not', 'gripped', 'tripe', 'gut', 'remain', 'intellectually', 'active', 'special', 'effects', 'then', 'are', 'object', 'study', 'consideration', 'not', 'frightening', 'element', 'house', 'beautiful', 'actors', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'rhythm', 'slow', 'miniseries', 'hence', 'video', 'art', 'not', 'cinema', 'too', 'time', 'develop', 'situation', 'only', 'real', 'situational', 'element', 'conflict', 'head', 'expedition', 'head', 'department', 'conflict', 'interesting', 'characterisation', 'university', 'department', 'heads', 'blockheads', 'narrow-minded', 'not', 'say', 'blind', 'people', 'Stephen', 'King', 'also', 'characterization', 'six', 'psychics', 'who', 'take', 'part', 'expedition', 'have', 'lot', 'humor', 'even', 'funny', 'yet', 'house', 'not', 'find', 'kingian', 'dimension', 'evil', 'not', 'identified', 'deepest', 'roots', 'hence', 'most', 'frightening', 'dimension', 'fear', 'viewer', 'not', 'outside', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'one', 'character', 'one', 'situation', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'frightened', 'will', 'only', 'be', 'superficial', 'way', 'time-enduring', 'can', 'not', 'identify', 'enormous', 'house', 'are', 'not', 'house', 'can', 'not', 'ever', 'dream', 'have', 'have', 'had', 'fancy', 'house', 'remain', 'outsiders', 'film', 'may', 'identify', 'explorers', 'yet', 'even', 'are', 'shown', 'different', 'abnormal', 'many', 'ways', 'can', 'not', 'project', 'normal', 'selves', 'shame', 'house', 'was', 'obviously', 'built', 'many', 'lines', 'can', 'recognize', 'here', 'there', 'models', 'come', 'many', 'films', 'horror', 'films', 'magic', 'horror', 'not', 'there.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'Universit', 'eacute', 'Paris', 'Panth', 'eacute', 'Sorbonne']",Rose Red [VHS]

Rose Red is a tale that could have easily made for Stephen Kings best novel since Needful Things, but instead he decided to write Rose Red as a screenplay (by request of Stephen Speliberg was orignally going to direct it), had Speliberg directed Rose Red we may have gotten the best horrow film in a decade, but that didn't happen. Instead we got another six hour mini-series, scaled back for a TV audience to a PG-13 rating. And this is where the downfall begins.The special effects are excellent (high-budget quality), the acting is for the most part good, but the director made decisions for the last hour of the movie and the story really winds down way too quick without much resolve. Long story short (because although I only give it 3 stars I do recommend you see this one) this mini-series is good, possibly Stephen Kings best, up till the end, then it kind of falls apart for a quick resolution. I think another hour would have done it justice.Now on to the DVD specifics. Rose Red is mastered in DD 5.1 (so it sounds great) and this alone will be incentive enough for some of you to pick up, but the bonus features aren't bad either.

I enjoyed the book, and actually thought the story was true, till I found out differently.  It was all very creepy, without being too scary.If Stephen King's mini-series had concentrated on the book, it would have been so much better.  The mini-series was about Ellen's great grandson's girlfriend who gets together a party of physics, including a 15 year-old autistic girl, to spend a weekend at Rose Red. Part of Ellen's story is re-told, to set the background of the house, and actually that is the best part.  The rest of the movie is too drawn out, too boring and predictable.  Also, the setting is in Seattle, with Rose Red, in all it's decrepit condition-- and believe me, it's a mess-- sitting on a main thoroughfare.  Hard to believe the city would allow that !!  Of course, the great grandson, Steve, says he is going to sell it for demolition soon, but the setting is hard to believe.There are so many silly scenes that made me want to yell ""Are you stupid?""  A photographer sent in by a professor to spy on the researchers, goes to, of all places to try to find his way out-  the greenhouse.  Or, as it's called ""The Health Room.""  After he sees there is nothing there but dead trees, he keeps walking in calling ""Is any one there?""  Yep, there was.  The killer bees.  The jerk should have gone back towards the front door.

595881,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00005JL6X,Joker,"[2, 2]","Rose Red (2002) was a made-for-TV haunted house movie based on Stephen King's novel.  It is 4 hours and 14 minutes long.  Basically it's about a team of psychics/paranormal investigators led by a psychology professor named Dr. Joyce Reardon (played by Nancy Travis) who go to a haunted mansion called Rose Red to conduct experiments to see if ghosts really do exist and to sort of ""awaken"" the mansion.  The team knows a lot about the history of the mansion beforehand, especially Joyce Reardon.  During the team's stay there, their presence and activities awaken spirits inside the house and the house's family secrets are uncovered.  The main character in this movie is a 15-year old girl named Annie Wheaton (played by Kimberly J. Brown), who is autistic and has powerful telepathic and telekinetic powers.  She uses these powers throughout the movie.It takes about an hour and fifteen minutes for the team of investigators to arrive at the mansion.  This movie has a very creepy haunted mansion setting that was very well done and well built.  I really liked the atmosphere in this movie.  Even the outside of the mansion during daylight hours is creepy looking.  I don't think this mansion quite compares to Hill House in The Haunting (1963), but I rank it as the second best haunted house setting in movie history.  Speaking of The Haunting, I'm a little disappointed in Stephen King.  He said he wanted to make ""the ultimate haunted house movie.""  But there's a problem - he no doubt borrowed from The Haunting and also The Legend Of Hell House (1973).  He borrowed Shirley Jackson's (author of the novel The Haunting Of Hill House, which The Haunting is based on) idea of the house coming alive and destroying itself and the idea that some houses are ""born bad"", although this was mentioned in the movie and appropriately credited.  The book Hell House was written by Richard Matheson and both the book and the movie it was based on, The Legend Of Hell House, stole from The Haunting in some ways as well, but now Rose Red stole from both The Haunting and The Legend Of Hell House.  Rose Red also borrows from The Innocents (1961).  I think this is one of Stephen King's most unoriginal stories, so I'm a little disappointed in his approach.  It just shows how influential Shirley Jackson's novel and the 1963 movie have been over the years to authors and movie makers.The best performances, in my opinion, were by Kimberly J. Brown and Nancy Travis.  Nancy Travis was perfectly cast as Dr. Joyce Reardon.  Kimberly J. Brown is outstanding in her role as Annie Wheaton.While creepy, the movie is sometimes a little on the corny side (especially during the second half) with some at least semi-cheesy CGI ghosts and special effects, though they're not nearly as cheesy as the ghosts in the remake of The Haunting (1999).  Just because CGI technology is available doesn't mean it should be used in a movie like this.  Some of the ghosts that appear are kind of on the ridiculous side as far as how they look and act.  In movies like the original The Haunting (1963) and The Legend Of Hell House (1973) you don't see the ghosts and that is how it really should be, in my opinion.  It's what you can't see that is so frightening.  That's why the remake of The Haunting (1999) was considered terrible by so many people, including myself.  It was loaded with CGI effects and you actually see the ghosts (and they even talk).  This is only one of the reasons why that movie was so bad.  Rose Red, on the other hand, is a much stronger movie all around, so the CGI ghosts are much easier for me to accept.Stephen King makes a cameo appearance as a pizza delivery man.  Overall, this movie is very solid, but I just can't help but notice the similarities to the three previously mentioned movies.  I definitely recommend this movie for anybody who likes haunted house movies.",4,Good haunted house movie,1267228800,"02 27, 2010",2010,3874,"['Rose', 'Red', '2002', 'was', 'made-for-TV', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'based', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', '4', 'hours', '14', 'minutes', 'long', 'Basically', 'team', 'psychics/paranormal', 'investigators', 'led', 'psychology', 'professor', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'played', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'who', 'go', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'called', 'Rose', 'Red', 'conduct', 'experiments', 'see', 'ghosts', 'really', 'do', 'exist', 'sort', 'awaken', 'mansion', 'team', 'lot', 'history', 'mansion', 'beforehand', 'especially', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'team', 'stay', 'there', 'presence', 'activities', 'awaken', 'spirits', 'house', 'house', 'family', 'secrets', 'are', 'uncovered', 'main', 'character', 'movie', '15-year', 'old', 'girl', 'named', 'Annie', 'Wheaton', 'played', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'who', 'autistic', 'powerful', 'telepathic', 'telekinetic', 'powers', 'powers', 'movie.It', 'hour', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'team', 'investigators', 'arrive', 'mansion', 'movie', 'very', 'creepy', 'haunted', 'mansion', 'setting', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'well', 'built', 'really', 'liked', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'Even', 'outside', 'mansion', 'daylight', 'hours', 'creepy', 'looking', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mansion', 'quite', 'Hill', 'House', 'Haunting', '1963', 'rank', 'second', 'best', 'haunted', 'house', 'setting', 'movie', 'history', 'Speaking', 'Haunting', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'Stephen', 'King', 'said', 'wanted', 'make', 'ultimate', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'problem', 'doubt', 'borrowed', 'Haunting', 'also', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', '1973', 'borrowed', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'author', 'novel', 'Haunting', 'Hill', 'House', 'Haunting', 'based', 'idea', 'house', 'coming', 'alive', 'destroying', 'idea', 'houses', 'are', 'born', 'bad', 'was', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'appropriately', 'credited', 'book', 'Hell', 'House', 'was', 'written', 'Richard', 'Matheson', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', 'stole', 'Haunting', 'ways', 'as', 'well', 'now', 'Rose', 'Red', 'stole', 'Haunting', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', 'Rose', 'Red', 'also', 'Innocents', '1961', 'think', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'most', 'unoriginal', 'stories', ""'m"", 'little', 'disappointed', 'approach', 'just', 'how', 'influential', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'novel', '1963', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'years', 'authors', 'movie', 'makers.The', 'best', 'performances', 'opinion', 'were', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'Kimberly', 'J', 'Brown', 'outstanding', 'role', 'Annie', 'Wheaton.While', 'creepy', 'movie', 'sometimes', 'little', 'corny', 'side', 'especially', 'second', 'half', 'least', 'semi-cheesy', 'CGI', 'ghosts', 'special', 'effects', ""'re"", 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'cheesy', 'ghosts', 'remake', 'Haunting', '1999', 'Just', 'CGI', 'technology', 'available', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'movie', 'ghosts', 'appear', 'are', 'kind', 'ridiculous', 'side', 'as', 'far', 'how', 'look', 'act', 'movies', 'original', 'Haunting', '1963', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', '1973', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'ghosts', 'how', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'opinion', 'what', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'so', 'frightening', 'why', 'remake', 'Haunting', '1999', 'was', 'considered', 'terrible', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'was', 'loaded', 'CGI', 'effects', 'actually', 'see', 'ghosts', 'even', 'talk', 'only', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'Rose', 'Red', 'other', 'hand', 'much', 'stronger', 'movie', 'around', 'CGI', 'ghosts', 'are', 'much', 'easier', 'accept.Stephen', 'King', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'man', 'Overall', 'movie', 'very', 'solid', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'similarities', 'three', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'movies', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anybody', 'who', 'haunted', 'house', 'movies']",Rose Red [VHS]

It's still the same thin and underwritten piece of melodrama that it was in 2002 when it debuted over three nights on ABC, but without all the commercials- and especially those very annoying ""Stephen King's Rose Red will return in a moment"" announcements that showed you all the upcoming scary scenes, thus minimizing their impact when you actually saw them in the show- the production actually gets some traction and is able to draw you in a little.Make no mistake. ""Rose Red"" is still basically a bunch of sketchy characters working within the barest sketch of a plot, but Craig Baxley's solid direction makes the most of what's there, and more importantly, it does a good job selling the many scare effects.  So, if you think of ""Rose Red"" as a good haunted house ride at the amusement park (albeit a pretty long one) rather than a standard mini-series with, you know, a good plot, solid motivations, and well-drawn characters, you'll have a good enough time.Disc 1 runs about 2 hours and 50 minutes and includes parts 1 and 2 of the original mini-series.  But pay attention if you just want to watch part 1 during your initial sitting. At about 1 hour and 24 minutes into the first disc, part 1 ends and the disc goes right into part 2, with only a slightly long fade to black and the sound of your DVD player keying up part 2 to alert you that you're moving into the second part of the series (the titles are only run at the beginning of part 1).  Disc 2 contains part 3 of the mini-series and runs the same 1 hour and 24 minutes or so as each of the first two parts.Disc 3 also contains a 50-minute ""making of"" piece and a 20-some minute phony documentary (Rose Red: The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"") that purports to tell you the ""real"" history of the Rose Red mansion in preparation for ""ABC's mini-series dramatization of the actual events that took place there"".  It's a clever promo piece that's actually okay to watch before you view the mini-series; with its mock-real flavor and its extra tidbits of Rose Red ""history"", it even enhances the mini-series a little.So, in the end I'd say that ""Rose Red"" was only a fair piece of entertainment when it originally aired, but without the commercials and with the interesting special features, ""Rose Red"" on DVD merits at least a ""good"" rating.

King stated during the documentary that he wanted to make the ultimate haunted house film. In order to make this the definative haunted house movie Steven King recycled some old ideas and lines from Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, THE INNOCENTS and his own work in THE SHINING (and probably others that I am not aware of).I am certain many fans recognized the plot elements and lines from THE HAUNTING including: The house is coming alive; Some houses are born bad (which was credited) and the basic idea of the plot which assumed that psychics would serve as a catalyst to the old house.

595886,A1FE5J4WGSCHY0,B00005JL6X,"Kevin B. Hovis ""Sir Kevin""","[2, 4]","Let me start off by saying that I love the work of Stephen King.  I have read every novel and collection that he has released and enjoyed many of his adaptations but this story lacked one thing. ORIGINALITY!  All Stephen King has done is update the The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson for the special effects crowd and that had already been done by Liam Neeson and gang a couple of years ago.  The main characters in both Robert Wise's 1963 adaptation and Stephen King's current spook house story are not really likeable.  The only character of a heroic nature in Rose Red is the character played by Julian Sands and he does not live to see the end. His character was the most enjoyable and interesting.  The Amityville Horror was much better than this claptrap. I did like the Winchester House angle and perhaps if they told that house's story, the movie would have been much better.  I would also have presented more demonic forces and perhaps possession.  In addition, the beginning of the film was overdrawn and we do not really get to see the house until nearly 90 minutes into the movie.

595887,A356TJCTCLDN89,B00005JL6X,Kimberley Wilson,"[2, 3]","After watching Rose Red for a few minutes I wondered what in the world Stephen King was thinking when he created this mess.  It had potential and it has some amusing moments  but the overall final product was bad.  The best thing going for it is the character of  Emery played by  Matt Ross .Emery is funny, rude , fiercely intelligent and severely damaged by having a nutcase for a mother. He's also the only one of the group who reacts the way a normal person would. He freaks out and at one point is willing to do whatever it takes to get the heck out of this haunted house.  Judith Ivey as Cathy did a fairly good job with a part that could have turned into caricature.. Usually the Christian character is treated badly in the movies but Cathy is shown to be kind, brave woman who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. She's basically Eleanor from the Haunting but with guts, humor and a will to live.  Julian Sands as Nick, the British telepath is very good and is the real hero of the story. Too bad he doesn't get more screen time.The rest of the cast is forgettable. Nancy Travis, playing Dr. Reardon who starts all the trouble by waking up the haunted house is not as bad as some the reviewers here claim. She's playing a card board character-- the mad scientist and there's not too much she can do with what she's been given. The actor playing the last living Rimbauer was boring and wimpy. I kept hoping that Rose Red would eat him. The autistic kid, Annie  was annoying.  Stephen King has been down that road before with and he did it much better in the past. If Annie is so important why does the house waste time on minor characters? Why not snap up the most powerful member of the ghost hunter team and be done with it? It's never explained.As far as the scares go there are only two mildly good moments. The first is when Cathy peeps out the window and looks away. Unbeknownst to her a malevolent spirit is peeping back at her from outside. The second is when Emery's ghastly mother lies helpless on the kitchen floor and sees a smirking Ellen and Sukie studying her. (Stephen King must have been frightened by a fat woman when he was a kid becuase he's created a literary gallery of mad, bad and dangerous to know fat ladies and Emery's mother fits all three categories.)Other than these two brief scenes there's nothing remotely frightening about Rose Red.  The ghosts look silly and when dead Ellen flies towards the front door she looks like a papier-mch&eacute; witch from an amusement park.  The rocks that hit Rose Red at the end look like sponges that  have been painted dark brown. Kids in a high school play could've done better than that and the ending is so bad that everyone involved should've hung their heads in shame.Stephen King probably meant this to be a homage to Shirley Jackson and to the Legend of Hell House but it doesn't cut it. Rose Red isn't even a good rip off. If you are the kind of person who buys everything with Stephen King's name on in it you'll want the DVD. The rest of us can safely pass this smelly piece of crap by.",2,roses are red but the viewers were blue,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,3086,"['watching', 'Rose', 'Red', 'few', 'minutes', 'wondered', 'what', 'world', 'Stephen', 'King', 'was', 'thinking', 'when', 'created', 'mess', 'had', 'potential', 'amusing', 'moments', 'overall', 'final', 'product', 'was', 'bad', 'best', 'thing', 'going', 'character', 'Emery', 'played', 'Matt', 'Ross', '.Emery', 'funny', 'rude', 'fiercely', 'intelligent', 'severely', 'damaged', 'having', 'nutcase', 'mother', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'group', 'who', 'way', 'normal', 'person', 'would', 'out', 'one', 'point', 'willing', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'heck', 'haunted', 'house', 'Judith', 'Ivey', 'Cathy', 'did', 'fairly', 'good', 'job', 'part', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'caricature..', 'Usually', 'Christian', 'character', 'treated', 'badly', 'movies', 'Cathy', 'shown', 'be', 'kind', 'brave', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'basically', 'Eleanor', 'Haunting', 'guts', 'humor', 'will', 'live', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'Nick', 'British', 'telepath', 'very', 'good', 'real', 'hero', 'story', 'Too', 'bad', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'forgettable', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'playing', 'Dr.', 'Reardon', 'who', 'trouble', 'waking', 'up', 'haunted', 'house', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'reviewers', 'here', 'claim', 'playing', 'card', 'board', 'character', 'mad', 'scientist', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'do', 'what', 'been', 'given', 'actor', 'playing', 'last', 'living', 'Rimbauer', 'was', 'boring', 'wimpy', 'kept', 'hoping', 'Rose', 'Red', 'would', 'eat', 'autistic', 'kid', 'Annie', 'was', 'annoying', 'Stephen', 'King', 'been', 'down', 'road', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'past', 'Annie', 'so', 'important', 'why', 'house', 'waste', 'time', 'minor', 'characters', 'Why', 'not', 'snap', 'up', 'most', 'powerful', 'member', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'team', 'be', 'done', 'never', 'explained.As', 'far', 'scares', 'go', 'are', 'only', 'two', 'mildly', 'good', 'moments', 'first', 'when', 'Cathy', 'out', 'window', 'away', 'Unbeknownst', 'malevolent', 'spirit', 'peeping', 'back', 'outside', 'second', 'when', 'Emery', 'ghastly', 'helpless', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'smirking', 'Ellen', 'Sukie', 'studying', 'Stephen', 'King', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'frightened', 'fat', 'woman', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'becuase', 'created', 'literary', 'gallery', 'mad', 'bad', 'dangerous', 'know', 'fat', 'ladies', 'Emery', 'mother', 'three', 'categories', 'Other', 'two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'nothing', 'remotely', 'frightening', 'Rose', 'Red', 'ghosts', 'look', 'silly', 'when', 'dead', 'Ellen', 'flies', 'towards', 'front', 'door', 'papier-mch', 'eacute', 'witch', 'amusement', 'park', 'rocks', 'hit', 'Rose', 'Red', 'end', 'look', 'sponges', 'have', 'been', 'painted', 'dark', 'brown', 'Kids', 'high', 'school', 'play', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'ending', 'so', 'bad', 'everyone', 'involved', 'should', ""'ve"", 'hung', 'heads', 'shame.Stephen', 'King', 'probably', 'meant', 'be', 'homage', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'Legend', 'Hell', 'House', ""n't"", 'cut', 'Rose', 'Red', ""n't"", 'even', 'good', 'rip', 'are', 'kind', 'person', 'who', 'everything', 'Stephen', 'King', 'name', ""'ll"", 'want', 'DVD', 'rest', 'can', 'safely', 'pass', 'smelly', 'piece', 'crap']",Rose Red [VHS]

595891,A2NYP1VC6FOFER,B00005JL6X,Larry Zieminski,"[0, 1]","Rose Red is not particularly scary, but it has some decent suspenseful scenes spread throughout its long running time (this was originally a 6 hour mini-series, so without commercials it runs just over 4 hours).  The acting is uniformly strong and of course the writing is great.  Looking back 9 years after it aired, some of the CG effects stick out, but thankfully most of the effects were done practically, so some of the creepy ghosts remain creepy.  The miniature work was very well done as well...you really can't tell what is a miniature and what was a real set.Unfortunately the ""2 Disc Deluxe Edition"" is not packed with features.  You get 2 minutes of Storyboard-to-Finished Film comparisons (3 scenes), a collection of Still shots of the sets, and 2 documentaries.  The first documentary is ""The Making of Rose Red."" It runs 50 minutes long.  There is a lot of good information here (including a lot of information from Stephen King himself), but it is mainly one of those promotional fluff pieces (ie lots of people saying things like ""This actor is brilliant"" or ""The script was amazing"").  Some of the interviews were done prior to release (the actors talk about their roles, but try to avoid spoilers), but then they show some footage about how they did the ending, so it is a little confusing about who it was aimed at.  The second ""documentary"" is ""Unlocking Rose Red: The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer"" which was a fake ""real life look"" into one of the characters in the movie.  The 22 minute show originally aired prior to the Rose Red mini-series, intending to provide background information and hype up the mini-series.  It has ""experts"" who relay the history of Ellen Rimbauer and Rose Red.  One thing I did like was that they had people playing some of the roles from the mini-series, so it looked like ""These are the real people, and you'll see an actor play them in the mini-series."" It gave it a bit of believability.  It works as a promotional piece, but most of the details are seen/discussed in the mini-series itself, so you won't miss anything by skipping it.I'd have liked a commentary track or two to be included on the set (if they couldn't get Stephen King to do one, then I'm sure some of the actors or the director could have been persuaded to do one).  Also, I wish they'd included some of the promotional trailers that aired leading up to the mini-series.This is definitely not the best Stephen King mini-series, nor the greatest haunted house story, but it works as a interesting story and is worth your time in checking out.  If you find that you like it, then I suggest you pick upThe Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red, a companion book that goes into the history of Rose Red in a little more detail.",4,Good Mini-series with an OK DVD,1285113600,"09 22, 2010",2010,2747,"['Rose', 'Red', 'not', 'particularly', 'scary', 'decent', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'spread', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'was', 'originally', '6', 'hour', 'mini-series', 'so', 'commercials', 'just', '4', 'hours', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'strong', 'course', 'writing', 'great', 'Looking', 'back', '9', 'years', 'aired', 'CG', 'effects', 'stick', 'out', 'thankfully', 'most', 'effects', 'were', 'done', 'practically', 'creepy', 'ghosts', 'remain', 'creepy', 'miniature', 'work', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'miniature', 'was', 'real', 'set.Unfortunately', '2', 'Disc', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'not', 'packed', 'features', 'get', '2', 'minutes', 'Storyboard-to-Finished', 'Film', 'comparisons', '3', 'scenes', 'collection', 'Still', 'shots', 'sets', '2', 'documentaries', 'first', 'documentary', 'Making', 'Rose', 'Red', '50', 'minutes', 'long', 'lot', 'good', 'information', 'here', 'including', 'lot', 'information', 'Stephen', 'King', 'mainly', 'one', 'promotional', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'ie', 'lots', 'people', 'saying', 'things', 'actor', 'brilliant', 'script', 'was', 'amazing', 'interviews', 'were', 'done', 'prior', 'release', 'actors', 'talk', 'roles', 'try', 'avoid', 'spoilers', 'then', 'show', 'footage', 'how', 'did', 'ending', 'little', 'confusing', 'who', 'was', 'aimed', 'second', 'documentary', 'Unlocking', 'Rose', 'Red', 'Diary', 'Ellen', 'Rimbauer', 'was', 'fake', 'real', 'life', 'look', 'one', 'characters', 'movie', '22', 'minute', 'show', 'originally', 'aired', 'prior', 'Rose', 'Red', 'mini-series', 'intending', 'provide', 'background', 'information', 'hype', 'up', 'mini-series', 'experts', 'who', 'relay', 'history', 'Ellen', 'Rimbauer', 'Rose', 'Red', 'One', 'thing', 'did', 'like', 'was', 'had', 'people', 'playing', 'roles', 'mini-series', 'looked', 'are', 'real', 'people', ""'ll"", 'see', 'actor', 'play', 'mini-series', 'gave', 'bit', 'believability', 'promotional', 'piece', 'most', 'details', 'are', 'seen/discussed', 'mini-series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'anything', 'skipping', 'it.I', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'commentary', 'track', 'two', 'be', 'included', 'set', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'Stephen', 'King', 'do', 'one', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', 'actors', 'director', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'persuaded', 'do', 'one', 'Also', 'wish', ""'d"", 'included', 'promotional', 'trailers', 'aired', 'leading', 'up', 'mini-series.This', 'definitely', 'not', 'best', 'Stephen', 'King', 'mini-series', 'greatest', 'haunted', 'house', 'story', 'interesting', 'story', 'time', 'checking', 'out', 'find', 'then', 'suggest', 'pick', 'upThe', 'Diary', 'Ellen', 'Rimbauer', 'Life', 'Rose', 'Red', 'companion', 'book', 'history', 'Rose', 'Red', 'little', 'more', 'detail']",Rose Red [VHS]

The special effects are mediocre, and the show itself is very long.  But the length of the show draws you into it, so you definitely do end up feeling uneasy, especially if you watch it at night.  Go ahead and make some snacks; you will need them, and there is no chance you will drop them out of your hand if something in the movie scares you.  I am very jumpy, but did not even twitch.  Usually, I forego snacks at scary movies, but you will need sustenance for this!The story is about psychology professor Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis from Becker) who is losing her tenure and desperately clawing at a chance to find strong evidence of supernatural phenomena for fame and fortune.  Despite the threats and intimidation of Professor Miller (David Dukes), her department head, she gathers a team of psychics to go on an expedition to a great abandoned house known as Rose Red.Rose Red was built there in Seattle in the early 1900's.  Wealthy entrepeneur Mr. Rimbauer built it for his young wife Ellen.  The marriage did not go well. Ellen became obsessed with the house, even though her young daughter April vanished there.  Many people disappeared in Rose Red, and the house was soon closed to even historical tours.The film is worth watching only because of the creepy little powerful psychic autistic girl named Annie (Kimberly Brown), and because you want to see what happens to all the characters as they are trapped together in the house.  My favorite character by far was Emery (Matt Ross).  Emery is a fat, nerdy, but hilariously arrogant Mama's boy who runs around the house with his mouth open. I was falling off my chair laughing.

Although I rarely read him anymore, I thought this miniseries looked interesting.  But it turned out to be a cross between Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" an the real story of the Winchester Mystery House in San Jose, California, where Sarah Winchester believed she would die if she stopped building her mansion.

Arriving at the decision to see Rose Red based on one of those AI recommendation machines, I never noticed that it was 1) by Stephen King, and 2) the four hour version of a television special.  In retrospect, I'm really not sure why I decided to see it, since haunted house horror movies generally don't grab me.  But I did, and after a moment of shocked realization discovered that I was having fun watching it.The story isn't anything spectacularly original. Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis), a parapsychology teacher,  bets her entire career on the possibility of finding measurable psychic phenomena at an eerie old mansion (Rose Red) in the heart of Seattle.  Said mansion has a long history of eating people, and Reardon's plan is to invite a selection of psychics to spend a weekend at the house in order to wake it from a dormant state.  Her ace in the hole is Annie Wheaton (Kimberly Brown), an autistic 15 year old who is an industrial strength tele-everything.Sure enough, the house wakes up, fingers get lopped off, people drown, and a whole host of equally nasty things start to happen.  As the mysteries about the house begin to unravel, things get even worse and it becomes clear that Rose Red has no intention of letting anyone go.  From that point on it is a pure battle for survival.The house is the real star of the film.  It is huge, full of weird rooms and interconnected hallways, and has a knack for rebuilding and changing itself.  CBS went all out to make it a spooky masterpiece, and they did a good job of it.  It's the kind of nightmare that you really would like to visit.  Think of it as a haunted theme park and you have the atmosphere.Acting varies, but is generally decent.  I'm not sure about Nancy Travis though.  She makes Joyce on of those sublimely irritating characters that you start out sympathizing with and wind up hoping she gets his with an axe.  No such luck.  Julian Sands and Matt Ross are brilliant and everyone else has moments of greatness.So I likes the show after all.  Since it's made for TV, don't expect a lot of gore or out and out violence.

Yes its long but very detailed and enthrawlling masterpiece. Stephen King captures this Haunted House tale of ""Rose Red."" If you love good old haunted houses and scary stories you'll love this. It has the sense of reality, maybe perhapes because some haunted houses are real or we would like to think so. Every house has a story, and this one is certainly has it's tale to tell.It's about a mansion of a house thats been built by John Rimbauer who built it for his wife as a wedding gift. Some gift I have to say. His wife then gets the idea about ghosts, and her having to build the house until it's done. It's a spectacular house with mysteries to every room. And every room having a story to tell. But that's not where the story ends. Dr. Joyce Reardon played by a very great Nancy Travis, loves the story of Rose Red...who wouldn't? She embarkes on getting a group of psychics with their own specialties to awaken the house of Rose Red. The one with the key to open the house is an amazing teenage girl who's Autistic girl named Annie Wheaton who has a special gift. I think that's why I love most of Stephen King's stories he seems to use children as the key to the unseen world. Such as in Stephen King's IT. Not to mention he's a fantastic story teller bringing together a remarkable cast and crew together to tell this haunted tale of which originally aired on ABC. It has a wonderful haunted tale, amazing characters that you'll love and love to hate.The DVD is a great buy! I was really impressed with it. It has a fantasic The Making of Rose Red. Which is very detailed and I think longer than a half an hour. It goes through the special effects, and how Stephen King got his idea to tell the tale, which is in fact based on the Winchester House in San Jose, California. It also goes through make up, and the cast tells their story of the making of the film. It's Stephen King's first I think since his accident. At least his television story mini series. And not to worry, Stephen King makes an appearance in his movie of course. The making of it is great I loved it. If you like the behind the scene's stuff that goes into the movie. It also pays tribute to David Dukes who sadly passed away in the movie. It also goes into detail of the book, The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, with Dr. Joyce Reardon. But they leave that part up to you whether to believe or not any way it's fun and detailed of the story before the team enters Rose Red. It also has production commentary which I have yet to view and other languages to select. I give the movie and DVD an A+!!! Just remember, ""Every house has a story to tell...this one will kill you.""",5,My Favorite Mini Series since Stephen King's IT!!,1022284800,"05 25, 2002",2002,2789,"['love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'mini', 'series', 'would', 'make', 'sure', 'set', 'VCR', 'time', 'one', 'would', 'come', 'was', 'exception', 'had', 'sit', 'watch', 'Yes', 'long', 'very', 'detailed', 'enthrawlling', 'masterpiece', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Haunted', 'House', 'tale', 'Rose', 'Red', 'love', 'good', 'old', 'haunted', 'houses', 'scary', 'stories', ""'ll"", 'love', 'sense', 'reality', 'maybe', 'perhapes', 'haunted', 'houses', 'are', 'real', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'so', 'Every', 'house', 'story', 'one', 'certainly', 'tale', 'tell.It', 'mansion', 'house', 'been', 'built', 'John', 'Rimbauer', 'who', 'built', 'wife', 'wedding', 'gift', 'gift', 'have', 'say', 'wife', 'then', 'idea', 'ghosts', 'having', 'build', 'house', 'done', 'spectacular', 'house', 'mysteries', 'room', 'room', 'having', 'story', 'tell', 'not', 'where', 'story', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'played', 'very', 'great', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'story', 'Rose', 'Red', 'who', 'would', ""n't"", 'getting', 'group', 'psychics', 'own', 'specialties', 'awaken', 'house', 'Rose', 'Red', 'one', 'key', 'open', 'house', 'amazing', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'Autistic', 'girl', 'named', 'Annie', 'Wheaton', 'who', 'special', 'gift', 'think', 'why', 'love', 'most', 'Stephen', 'King', 'stories', 'use', 'children', 'key', 'unseen', 'world', 'Such', 'Stephen', 'King', 'IT', 'Not', 'mention', 'fantastic', 'story', 'teller', 'bringing', 'together', 'remarkable', 'cast', 'crew', 'together', 'tell', 'haunted', 'tale', 'originally', 'aired', 'ABC', 'wonderful', 'haunted', 'tale', 'amazing', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'love', 'love', 'hate.The', 'DVD', 'great', 'buy', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'fantasic', 'Making', 'Rose', 'Red', 'Which', 'very', 'detailed', 'think', 'longer', 'half', 'hour', 'special', 'effects', 'how', 'Stephen', 'King', 'got', 'idea', 'tell', 'tale', 'fact', 'based', 'Winchester', 'House', 'San', 'Jose', 'California', 'also', 'make', 'up', 'cast', 'story', 'making', 'film', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first', 'think', 'accident', 'least', 'television', 'story', 'mini', 'series', 'not', 'worry', 'Stephen', 'King', 'appearance', 'movie', 'course', 'making', 'great', 'loved', 'like', 'scene', 'stuff', 'movie', 'also', 'tribute', 'David', 'Dukes', 'who', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'movie', 'also', 'detail', 'book', 'Diary', 'Ellen', 'Rimbauer', 'Dr.', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'leave', 'part', 'up', 'believe', 'not', 'way', 'fun', 'detailed', 'story', 'team', 'enters', 'Rose', 'Red', 'also', 'production', 'commentary', 'have', 'yet', 'view', 'other', 'languages', 'select', 'give', 'movie', 'DVD', 'A+', 'Just', 'remember', 'house', 'story', 'tell', 'one', 'will', 'kill']",Rose Red [VHS]

A few rare examples:  &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; &quot;Carrie,&quot; &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, &quot;Stand by me&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption.&quot;  ROSE RED could have been a really epic haunted house movie, but King borrows so much from previous novels and the producers dug up some really bland actors, therefore negating the potential right away.  So much of what goes on in &quot;Rose Red&quot; is muddled and pretentious.  Characters disappear and obviously die, but for some reason the script doesn't allow us to see that.  Even though made for TV, I think a little more actual scenes of the murders may have made it a little more interesting.  As far as the acting goes:  Nancy Travis (?) does not have the chops to carry such a schizophrenic role; she tries but a more seasoned actress could have made her more believable.  Overacting awards have to go to Laura Kenney (Emery's mother); Matt Ross (Emery himself); David Dukes (sad he died during the filming, but his performance was too comedic to be taken seriously).  Kimberly Brown as Annie, Matt Keesler as Steve, and Judith Ivey as Kathy did well; the others merely adequate.

Steven King stories are all fairly long-winded anyway. I never read the book so I can't compare the screenplay to it which, judging by the negative reviews was a good thing. I pretty much liked the characters - especially Annie, the autistic girl with tremendous psychic power. She appears to be the only one not actually in any danger from the house.

It was never shown on Oz TV so seeing it all in one go was better for me anyway.The story is about an old house that has a curse that it is alive in a way. And the myth is that the previous occupents who lived there said that the house would tell them to continue to build it, or die.The house has been vacant for many years, and it's legend is known to many around the area. And Nancy Travis has decided to go looking for paranormal activity in the house to find out if the legends are true or not?She takes with her a team, one of a little girl with telekinesis that is very much like the Carrie charactor. Steven even included a scene that was in the Carrie book, but didnt make it into the movie because they couldnt make the effect look good, and that was falling stones that the little girl makes come about.A few of Stevens other storys are dabbed in here and there to make a horror movie. I wouldnt say it scared me tho, not the least, some people it might scare, but I just found it interesting, never boring, and not predictable.Some people dont like it because it goes for too long, it does go for a while, it's on 2 DVD's and about 4 hours long or so. But it's long because it was a mini series. And any time Steven's novels get turned into movies, they have to cut out so much to shorten the film. with this series he could do whatever he wanted without having to cut anything, so thats why it's so long.The 2 featurettes are ok, one is the featurette about the cast and the making of. And the other is a fictional story about a previous owner of the house who talks about what was happening to her and the house and gives you more insight into the Rose Red house.It's one of my favorite films. But I wouldnt say it's horror, suspence, or a thriller. I'm not sure what you would call it? Maybe a bit of everything. For blood and gore fans you will be disapointed in this film, it's kind of.. well, i'd say it's sort of a fammily movie on the paronormal/spooky/thriller/horror side.

Which is good for you, keeps you alive.  Or at least in my opinion it does.  And Rose Red is 254 minutes of scary movie.  Well, sorta scary.Dr. Joyce Reardon is obsessed with the paranormal.  Her greatest focus is on a local haunt in Seattle though, Rose Red.  A mansion that appears to keep on growing and is the source of many murders and disappearances.  Putting together a team of psychics and people with miraculous abilities, she sets out for Rose Red, hoping to find proof of a haunting and become vindicated in her field.  However, Rose Red has different ideas for what everybody there will do.Characters:Dr. Joyce Reardon: Nancy TravisSteven Rimbauer: Matt KeeslarRachel Wheaton: Melanie LynskeyAnnie Wheaton: Kimberly BrownCathy Kramer: Judith IveyEmery Waterman: Matt RossNick Hardaway: Julian SandsPam Asbury: Emily DeschanelVictor Kandinsky: Kevin TigheI haven't watched this in awhile, so it was kind of surprising for me to see Emily Deschanel in this movie.  She doesn't have a huge part, but she does play an interesting character.  I think my favorite role in this movie was done by Sands as Nick Hardaway.  He was just such a nice guy as a character and a pleasure to watch.  I was rooting for him the whole time.  In contrast, the character of Emery Waterman was exceptionally annoying.  Which means that Ross did a good job, because he was supposed to be irritating.  All of the actors did pretty well actually, there just wasn't much they could do about a poorly written plot.And it was poorly written.  Stephen King does a lot of things well, but this movie script was jumbled and all over the place.  And since it was long it needed to have a smooth timeline, which it just didn't.  Between the glimpses of the past, the random happenings to the characters, and the general mish-mash of things, it was hard to really settle into the movie.  Not to mention for a scary movie, it wasn't very scary.  It was a mix of the Haunting, the real life Winchester House, and a few other things, so you already knew what to expect.  But the likable characters carried it through so that overall it was an average experience.  I think if they had just slowed down a bit and developed the plot, this could have been a spectacularly scary film.The cinematography was actually pretty well done.  They had great special effects and the ghosts, while not scary, were convincing and realistic looking.  They shifted between normal and rotting but yet looked the like the same person.  I also liked the setting of the house.  It was weird and spooky and had a bunch of interesting rooms.  The music wasn't very noticeable.  Mostly instrumental and in the background.  I can't say it really improved or ruined anything.  It was just sort of there.It's not the best scary movie out there.  But it's good for a rainy day as background noise.  It certainly lasts long enough you don't have to keep changing discs!Review by M.

595916,A50W7ZVTG606,B00005JL6X,"Naomi Tilley ""Story Buff""","[0, 0]","Unlike some people, I love Stephen King's marathon movies. His personal adaption of 'The Shining' is one of my absolute favourites, and anyone who enjoyed that will certainly enjoy Rose Red.In many ways, the stories are very similar. They both revolve around a house that exudes evil, and the people that are drawn in and trapped.Rose Red begins with the focus on the character that will become the focal point of the film, autistic Annie Wheaton, who also happens to be a very powerful telepathic and telekinetic. We are given a display of her talents early on, much in the same way that Stephen King's The Shining introduces us early on to Danny Torrance's extraordinary gifts.We then skip forward to present day, and are gradually introduced to Joyce Reardon, the college professor who is preparing to lead an expedition of psychics into the infamous mansion estate of Rose Red.The building has an extremely checkered past, with men meeting gruesome deaths and women disappearing without a trace. As with the Overlook Hotel, Rose Red is a building that seems to have a life of its own, and readily consumes any who dare step inside.This is most poignant with the character of Joyce Reardon, who was already dangerously obsessed with Rose Red, and who crosses over that thin line all too easily once she is inside the house.Some have complained the movie is far too long, and at a whopping four hours, they may be right. But without the length of the film, King would not have been able to show Joyce Reardon's descent into obsession and madness as effectively.One thing I noted, though, was Matt Ross as Emery Waterman. During my first viewing, I found myself severely irritated by his appearance, and the constant sneer on his pudgy face. It wasn't until my second viewing that it occurred to me that this actor would have made a perfect Harold Lauder in The Stand. I thought it a nice touch that not only did Emery survive the Rose Red ordeal (and escape his nightmare of a mother in the process), he became a much better and nicer person for the experience.I finished my second viewing of the film hoping that Rachel Wheaton, Annie's older sister, ended up with Steve Rimbauer, with Annie in their permanent care. There was no such inference, of course, but we're allowed our little fantasies.Rose Red, despite its many similarities to The Shining, is still a worthwhile movie - if you have the patience for it.",5,Thrilling to watch,1065398400,"10 6, 2003",2003,2417,"['people', 'love', 'Stephen', 'King', 'marathon', 'movies', 'personal', 'adaption', ""'The"", 'Shining', 'one', 'absolute', 'favourites', 'anyone', 'who', 'enjoyed', 'will', 'certainly', 'enjoy', 'Rose', 'Red.In', 'many', 'ways', 'stories', 'are', 'very', 'similar', 'revolve', 'house', 'evil', 'people', 'are', 'drawn', 'trapped.Rose', 'Red', 'focus', 'character', 'will', 'become', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'autistic', 'Annie', 'Wheaton', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'powerful', 'telepathic', 'telekinetic', 'are', 'given', 'display', 'talents', 'early', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Shining', 'introduces', 'early', 'Danny', 'Torrance', 'extraordinary', 'gifts.We', 'then', 'forward', 'present', 'day', 'are', 'gradually', 'introduced', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'college', 'professor', 'who', 'preparing', 'lead', 'expedition', 'psychics', 'infamous', 'mansion', 'estate', 'Rose', 'Red.The', 'building', 'extremely', 'checkered', 'past', 'men', 'meeting', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'women', 'disappearing', 'trace', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'Rose', 'Red', 'building', 'have', 'life', 'own', 'readily', 'consumes', 'who', 'dare', 'step', 'inside.This', 'most', 'poignant', 'character', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'who', 'was', 'already', 'dangerously', 'obsessed', 'Rose', 'Red', 'who', 'thin', 'line', 'too', 'easily', 'house.Some', 'have', 'complained', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'whopping', 'four', 'hours', 'may', 'be', 'right', 'length', 'film', 'King', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'show', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'descent', 'obsession', 'madness', 'effectively.One', 'thing', 'noted', 'was', 'Matt', 'Ross', 'Emery', 'Waterman', 'first', 'viewing', 'found', 'severely', 'irritated', 'appearance', 'constant', 'sneer', 'pudgy', 'face', 'was', ""n't"", 'second', 'viewing', 'occurred', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'perfect', 'Harold', 'Lauder', 'Stand', 'thought', 'nice', 'touch', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'Emery', 'survive', 'Rose', 'Red', 'ordeal', 'escape', 'nightmare', 'mother', 'process', 'became', 'much', 'better', 'nicer', 'person', 'experience.I', 'finished', 'second', 'viewing', 'film', 'hoping', 'Rachel', 'Wheaton', 'Annie', 'older', 'sister', 'ended', 'up', 'Steve', 'Rimbauer', 'Annie', 'permanent', 'care', 'was', 'such', 'inference', 'course', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'little', 'fantasies.Rose', 'Red', 'many', 'similarities', 'Shining', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'have', 'patience']",Rose Red [VHS]

Here, King has written a movie full of both suspense and offbeat humor as well as moments of sheer horror.King seems to have a fascination for powerful young ladies as seen in Firestarter and Carrie, and here he continues that tradition with Annie, an autistic teenage girl with phenomenal telekinetic abilities. It is Annie who mostly steals the show.Some reviewers claim that this miniseries is needlessly too long, but when you get into, time just seems to fly when there's no commercial interruptions to break the mood. I love Rose Red. This movie is a lot more gripping than Storm Of The Century or even Stephen King's, It. This miniserries has a flaw or two-- we see too little of the psychics before the house gets them, and Nancy Travis' performance at the end could've been a little bit more emotional when she realizes that she is not leaving that house-- ever, but those are minor little things that don't really mar an otherwise great mini-series.

595924,ACMAUJEBY6GJF,B00005JL6X,Pl Amundsen,"[5, 5]","This DVD contains a mini-serie of two episodes based on a script by Stephen King. It is long, 245 minutes (if I remember correct?), but this is by far one of the best King-screen-adaptions I have ever seen. Talented actors (delievering remembarable performances here), impressive camera-work, good effects, yes, a surprisingly well done production - and that for a TV-movie.I have seen many (perhaps most) horrible thrillers based on Stephen Kings' books. Christine, It, Sleepwalkers and so on and on. B-movies based on great books though, but it is a shame that all these past productions reflects all the great work from this famous, talented actor. The most famous and critically acclaimed ""The Shining"" (Jack Nicholson) after all is more Stanley Kubricks' than it is Kings', only vaguely based on the book of the same name.Rose Red was a surprise, and I would nearly call this a masterpiece. It doesn't give you the impression that the production-theme was in a hurry, more the oposite actually. It shows that the moviemakers with the actors were having a good time doing this, and doing their best that is.The movie reminded me instantly of ""The Haunting"" (Neeson, Zeta-Jones) from the late 90's, but is far more talent than effects, and a thin script. The actors are better too, and I mean it! But these movies share a lot of similarities, so if you liked ""The Haunting"" you'll probably love this one. I know did.Creepy? It's not ""The Ring"", but watching it on nightschift as I did yesterday it sure had some effect on me. And it doesn't seem as long as it actually is. The castle (if that is what ""Rose Red"" should be called is amazing, the place is a horror-movie itself, and far more spooky (not to mention BIG!) than the haunted building in ""The Haunting"" (another comparatition).I'll watch it again tonight, I'm on nightschift again :)The best King-horror-movie in years, perhaps the best ever, and the first to be worthy of his pen (if you know what I mean).

All I can say is that I was scared to turn the lights off for about a week afterward. Just imagine staying in a mansion with a reputation for the people who have died in it.  Added to that, there are people who have gone in but have never come out. The house is alive and feeds on the fears of those who dare to enter its doors. When a professor trying to establish herself in a university, collects several people with special powers in order to research this evil home, she does not realize the magnitude of its power. One by one the group gets smaller as each comes face to face with the evil that dwells within the walls of this massive house. With Stephen King's uncanny ability to allow us to identify with the strangest of characters, you will detest the jealous colleague,hate the whiney momma's boy, feel for the big sister of Annie, and feel drawn to Annie the little girl who can make Rose Red come alive.

595929,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JL6X,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[4, 4]","Rose Red (Craig Baxley, 2001)Craig Baxley, who did such a wonderful job with the adaptation of Stephen King's Storm of the Century (and recently  completed an adaptation of one of my favorite woefully underappreciated books, Brooks Stanwood's chilling The Glow), took on another written-for-the-small-screen King  miniseries and came up with an opposite effect. In all the places where Storm was great, Rose Red stumbles.The plot surrounds a haunted house in Seattle (can we all say The Winchester Mansion, folks?) and a professor of  child psychology, Joyce Reardon (Nancy Travis, of So I Married an Axe Murderer fame), who believes that the key to getting hard evidence of the paranormal phenomena in  the house lies in a sixteen year old autistic girl named Annie (Kimberley Brown, of various Nickelodeon movies and A Bug's Life). She also invites Annie's sister Lauren  (Melanie Lynskey, most famous as Kate Winslet's foil in Heavenly Creatures) and a plethora of other psychics along for the Memorial Day Weekend ride.The main problem witbh Rose Red is that, despite a cast that redefines ""high-powered"" where TV miniseries are  concerned, the whole thing is painfully overacted. Of the entire cast, only Julian Sands (as psychic Nick Hardaway) and Lynskey deliver performances that would seem out of  place on a daytime soap opera. Storm of the Century gave us a cast of then-relatively-unknowns who played their parts with chilling minimalism. The comparison is  painful.Worth seeing if you're a King completist, but Storm of the Century or the video release of The Stand (six hours on  tape, eight on TV) is a much better way to spend a long King-soaked afternoon. ** 1/2",2,Not up to the usual standards.,1015113600,"03 3, 2002",2002,1679,"['Rose', 'Red', 'Craig', 'Baxley', '2001', 'Craig', 'Baxley', 'who', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'adaptation', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Storm', 'Century', 'recently', 'completed', 'adaptation', 'one', 'favorite', 'woefully', 'underappreciated', 'books', 'Brooks', 'Stanwood', 'chilling', 'Glow', 'took', 'written-for-the-small-screen', 'King', 'miniseries', 'came', 'up', 'opposite', 'effect', 'places', 'where', 'Storm', 'was', 'great', 'Rose', 'Red', 'stumbles.The', 'plot', 'haunted', 'house', 'Seattle', 'can', 'say', 'Winchester', 'Mansion', 'folks', 'professor', 'child', 'psychology', 'Joyce', 'Reardon', 'Nancy', 'Travis', 'So', 'Married', 'Axe', 'Murderer', 'fame', 'who', 'key', 'getting', 'hard', 'evidence', 'paranormal', 'phenomena', 'house', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'autistic', 'girl', 'named', 'Annie', 'Kimberley', 'Brown', 'various', 'Nickelodeon', 'movies', 'A', 'Bug', 'Life', 'also', 'Annie', 'sister', 'Lauren', 'Melanie', 'Lynskey', 'most', 'famous', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'foil', 'Heavenly', 'Creatures', 'plethora', 'other', 'psychics', 'Memorial', 'Day', 'Weekend', 'ride.The', 'main', 'problem', 'witbh', 'Rose', 'Red', 'cast', 'high-powered', 'where', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'are', 'concerned', 'whole', 'thing', 'painfully', 'overacted', 'entire', 'cast', 'only', 'Julian', 'Sands', 'psychic', 'Nick', 'Hardaway', 'Lynskey', 'deliver', 'performances', 'would', 'seem', 'place', 'daytime', 'soap', 'opera', 'Storm', 'Century', 'gave', 'cast', 'then-relatively-unknowns', 'who', 'played', 'parts', 'chilling', 'minimalism', 'comparison', 'painful.Worth', 'seeing', ""'re"", 'King', 'completist', 'Storm', 'Century', 'video', 'release', 'Stand', 'six', 'hours', 'tape', 'eight', 'TV', 'much', 'better', 'way', 'spend', 'long', 'King-soaked', 'afternoon', '1/2']",Rose Red [VHS]

Well worth watching a few times over, and full of suspense, mystery, a living house that builds itself trapping/eating its victims as they explore inside, to vampiric ghosts to thepara psychology professor and her hired team of psychics and mystics to spend a memorial day week-end lock in investigation only to find slowly they are actually being used and being the hunted themselves.Again, just plain old good horror fun with great story line and superb effects, and a huge creepy old beautiful mansion it takes place in.If you buy the dvd make sure you see the specail features as it tells about the other real legends that have taken place to have inspired Stephen King to write the book for this movie.

That being said,, this particular movie is well in the line of King's stories... Did I enjoy watching It ? Not that much actually. I mean this is not the best of all Stephen King stories.

Of course, terrible things can happen in real life too, even real accidents can happen \ Anyway,,, this particular movie takes place in a huge mansion located in Seattle ,  and this house has a form of intellignece, a bad one in the movie of course.

Finally, this house of woes, considered as a living thing itself, is rocked by large meteorites. So much for the storey.

595947,AO5DDG05DHVIC,B00005JL6X,"Thomas ""tomsde""","[0, 0]","I originally watched Rose Red on TV when it was aired back in 2002 and have to admit that it's my favorite Steven King Mini Series of all time, I think this was my third viewing tonight.  I have a love/hate relationship with Mr. Kings works--both on the screen and novels. The special effects were state of the art for their time and I imagine that many of the models and puppets used would be replaced by computer generated effects were the series to be remade today, but still hold up well and look quite convincing.  The story line is basically a combination of plots from other novels namely The Shining, The Haunting of Hill House, with a handful of historic fact from the Winchester Puzzle house.  Although Mr. King admitted having derived part of the story from the historical Winchester house in an interview in the special features, I was rather disappointed that he did not give any credit to Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House--because I think it's the strongest influence of all and is quoted more than once in the film.  Without revealing too much, I will only say that I liked the ending and found it more satisfying than some of his other stuff, most notably Storm of the Century--a story in which everyone gets screwed and there is very little light to come through.  I have to give him credit though for not portraying one of the psychics who was a Christian as being a crazy or bigoted person as such characters are often portrayed in stories.  The similarities with the Shining can't be ignored either, the Overlook Hotel and Rose Red have a lot of similarities in that they are so large that they are practically worlds unto themselves and that they each actually are anthropomorphized and characters unto themselves.  Again we have a gifted and misunderstood children with psychic abilities, and obsessed coconspirators with the edifices.  There is also the sealing off the characters from the outside world so that they have to rely on their own resources for the most part to survive.  I won't summarize the plot further as there is enough of that on the mini series page and I don't want to provide any spoilers.  I will say that if you like creepy, but not very gory stories, and are a fan of The Haunting of Hill House then you should enjoy this miniseries even if a lot of elements give you a sense of deja vu.",5,A Good Mini Series That Holds Up Well Over Time,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",2013,2343,"['originally', 'watched', 'Rose', 'Red', 'TV', 'when', 'was', 'aired', 'back', '2002', 'have', 'admit', 'favorite', 'Steven', 'King', 'Mini', 'Series', 'time', 'think', 'was', 'third', 'viewing', 'tonight', 'have', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'Mr.', 'Kings', 'screen', 'novels', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'state', 'art', 'time', 'imagine', 'many', 'models', 'puppets', 'used', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'computer', 'generated', 'effects', 'were', 'series', 'be', 'remade', 'today', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'look', 'quite', 'convincing', 'story', 'line', 'basically', 'combination', 'plots', 'other', 'novels', 'namely', 'Shining', 'Haunting', 'Hill', 'House', 'handful', 'historic', 'fact', 'Winchester', 'Puzzle', 'house', 'Mr.', 'King', 'admitted', 'having', 'derived', 'part', 'story', 'historical', 'Winchester', 'house', 'interview', 'special', 'features', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'credit', 'Shirley', 'Jackson', 'Haunting', 'Hill', 'House', 'think', 'strongest', 'influence', 'quoted', 'more', 'once', 'film', 'revealing', 'too', 'much', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'liked', 'ending', 'found', 'more', 'satisfying', 'other', 'stuff', 'most', 'notably', 'Storm', 'Century', 'story', 'everyone', 'screwed', 'very', 'little', 'light', 'come', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'not', 'portraying', 'one', 'psychics', 'who', 'was', 'Christian', 'being', 'crazy', 'bigoted', 'person', 'such', 'characters', 'are', 'often', 'portrayed', 'stories', 'similarities', 'Shining', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'ignored', 'either', 'Overlook', 'Hotel', 'Rose', 'Red', 'have', 'lot', 'similarities', 'are', 'so', 'large', 'are', 'practically', 'worlds', 'unto', 'actually', 'are', 'anthropomorphized', 'characters', 'unto', 'Again', 'have', 'gifted', 'misunderstood', 'children', 'psychic', 'abilities', 'obsessed', 'coconspirators', 'edifices', 'also', 'sealing', 'off', 'characters', 'outside', 'world', 'have', 'rely', 'own', 'resources', 'most', 'part', 'survive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'summarize', 'plot', 'further', 'enough', 'mini', 'series', 'page', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'provide', 'spoilers', 'will', 'say', 'like', 'creepy', 'not', 'very', 'gory', 'stories', 'are', 'fan', 'Haunting', 'Hill', 'House', 'then', 'should', 'enjoy', 'miniseries', 'even', 'lot', 'elements', 'give', 'sense', 'deja', 'vu']",Rose Red [VHS]

The professor tries to harnass their power in order to witness credible paranormal activity that will boost her reputation.  The house is Rose Red, an old mansion that takes victims in the most unusual ways and can even change its interior.

The whole story idea is woven together perfectly and the characters are incredible. It is a classic Steven King masterpiece, as you'll see by the twists he threw in to the movie. Rose Red has made me believe that houses are indeed alive and I now look at every house a little differently. The characters in this movies are all memorable, and it's easy to relate to at least one of them. They're typical people with extraordinary powers, chosen to go on a nearly suicidal expedition. Nick Hardaway (Julian Sands) is one of my all-time favorite movie characters, and I'm in severe denial about his demise in Rose Red. He is so charismatic and charming that it's hard not to love him. Even Emery Waterman (Matt Ross) is hard to hate, because after a while you just grow attached to him for some reason. Matt Ross said himself in an interview that ""Emery's a character you hate, but hopefully you enjoy hating."" Overall, this movie is great for Stephen King lovers. If anybody thinks it's too long, then watch it in segments or don't watch it at all. That's all there is to it.
