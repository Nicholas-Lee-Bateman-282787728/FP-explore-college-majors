This DVD only has 4 episodes, but it shows that spoken word is definately going somewhere.  I didn't fast-forward through any of the poems, which means none of them were stupid or boring.

825215,A3ICDLUQ3V2QY2,B00026L9B6,"Kevin L. Nenstiel ""omnivore""","[3, 5]","I really did like this when I began watching it.  The performers are lively and dynamic, with a good quality of poems, enhanced by a committed audience and high production values.  But the more I watch it, the more frustrated I become.  It just doesn't hold up to multiple viewings.On first watch, it is good.  You might hear that it's a televised poetry performance and think you're going to see the Open Mike Night From Hell, but these poets are experienced performers and known crowd-pleasers.  They hook the audience and keep them paying attention.  I just wish there was something stronger and more compelling to pay attention to.Part of the problem is the limited range of subject matters.  I know the hip-hop milieu demands some attention to race, but the poetry on race issues sticks to a few well-worn ideas, most of them delivered in the same high-key and indistinctly enraged tone.  The poetry about sex is similarly repetetive.  It's not true, as some have said, that Andrea Dworkin claimed all sex is rape, but if you go by what you find on this DVD, you'll think most of it is.A lot of the anger seems ungrounded.  The prime example of this is duet act Yellow Rage, who seem angry that others dare approach them as equals.  They start out shouting, they never stop shouting, and at one point they are shouting over each other, so that I can't follow a blessed word they are saying.  I know that a lot of people seem to want to regard Asian women as sex toys, but I'm not one of them, so why are they yelling at me?  The correct answer is, they're not.  They're just yelling because that's what they do.There are a number of very good poets in this collection.  Taylor Mali, Suheir Hammad, and Poetri (yes, that's a real stage name) have well-written, incisive, and often funny poetry that makes the audience really think about what they're hearing, and question themselves.  And each episode features a highly regarded senior artist from American poetry, including Nikki Giovanni, Amiri Baraka, and the Last Poets.  Not only are they excellent writers, but every one of them has a Hamlet-like stage presence worthy of the outsized poems they bring onstage with them.But why are Dave Chapelle and Cedric the Entertainer in the show?  And why are they reading poetry that feels like it got a B- in Freshman Poetry Analysis?  I know these performers have a cachet that might bring an audience to the show, but they themselves feel as out-of-place as a honky in tie and tails attending a Public Enemy concert.  And please, Mr. Simmons: of all the sentimental white-chick poets to get on your stage, you had to go with Jewel?  I'm not sure you couldn't have done better going to any open mike night in America and picking out a random seventh-grader with dyed hair.By no means is this series bad.  But the good parts are strewn like bread crumbs through a minefield of verse.  Devoted poetry fanatics may get plenty out of this series, but I can't recommend it to casual viewers.  You'd be better rewarded to go withSlam Nation: The Sport of Spoken WordorIndividual World Poetry Slam 2007if you want a feel for what poetry feels like on the modern stage.  This one is like a song with one note, a note that goes on far too long for my money.",3,Doesn't Hold Up to Multiple Viewings,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,3250,"['really', 'did', 'when', 'began', 'watching', 'performers', 'are', 'lively', 'dynamic', 'good', 'quality', 'poems', 'enhanced', 'committed', 'audience', 'high', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'watch', 'more', 'frustrated', 'become', 'just', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'multiple', 'viewings.On', 'first', 'watch', 'good', 'might', 'hear', 'televised', 'poetry', 'performance', 'think', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', 'Open', 'Mike', 'Night', 'From', 'Hell', 'poets', 'are', 'experienced', 'performers', 'known', 'crowd-pleasers', 'hook', 'audience', 'keep', 'paying', 'attention', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'something', 'stronger', 'more', 'compelling', 'pay', 'attention', 'to.Part', 'problem', 'limited', 'range', 'subject', 'matters', 'know', 'hip-hop', 'milieu', 'attention', 'race', 'poetry', 'race', 'issues', 'sticks', 'few', 'well-worn', 'ideas', 'most', 'delivered', 'same', 'high-key', 'indistinctly', 'enraged', 'tone', 'poetry', 'sex', 'similarly', 'repetetive', 'not', 'true', 'have', 'said', 'Andrea', 'Dworkin', 'claimed', 'sex', 'rape', 'go', 'what', 'find', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'think', 'most', 'lot', 'anger', 'ungrounded', 'prime', 'example', 'duet', 'act', 'Yellow', 'Rage', 'who', 'seem', 'angry', 'others', 'dare', 'approach', 'equals', 'start', 'out', 'shouting', 'never', 'stop', 'shouting', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'shouting', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'follow', 'blessed', 'word', 'are', 'saying', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'seem', 'want', 'regard', 'Asian', 'women', 'sex', 'toys', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'so', 'why', 'are', 'yelling', 'correct', 'answer', ""'re"", 'not', ""'re"", 'just', 'yelling', 'what', 'do.There', 'are', 'number', 'very', 'good', 'poets', 'collection', 'Taylor', 'Mali', 'Suheir', 'Hammad', 'Poetri', 'yes', 'real', 'stage', 'name', 'have', 'well-written', 'incisive', 'often', 'funny', 'poetry', 'audience', 'really', 'think', 'what', ""'re"", 'hearing', 'question', 'episode', 'highly', 'regarded', 'senior', 'artist', 'American', 'poetry', 'including', 'Nikki', 'Giovanni', 'Amiri', 'Baraka', 'Last', 'Poets', 'Not', 'only', 'are', 'excellent', 'writers', 'one', 'Hamlet-like', 'stage', 'presence', 'worthy', 'outsized', 'poems', 'bring', 'onstage', 'them.But', 'why', 'are', 'Dave', 'Chapelle', 'Cedric', 'Entertainer', 'show', 'why', 'are', 'reading', 'poetry', 'got', 'B-', 'Freshman', 'Poetry', 'Analysis', 'know', 'performers', 'have', 'cachet', 'might', 'bring', 'audience', 'show', 'feel', 'as', 'out-of-place', 'honky', 'tie', 'tails', 'attending', 'Public', 'Enemy', 'concert', 'please', 'Mr.', 'Simmons', 'sentimental', 'white-chick', 'poets', 'get', 'stage', 'had', 'go', 'Jewel', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'better', 'going', 'open', 'mike', 'night', 'America', 'picking', 'out', 'random', 'seventh-grader', 'dyed', 'hair.By', 'means', 'series', 'bad', 'good', 'parts', 'are', 'strewn', 'bread', 'crumbs', 'minefield', 'verse', 'Devoted', 'poetry', 'fanatics', 'may', 'get', 'plenty', 'series', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'casual', 'viewers', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'rewarded', 'go', 'withSlam', 'Nation', 'Sport', 'Spoken', 'WordorIndividual', 'World', 'Poetry', 'Slam', '2007if', 'want', 'feel', 'what', 'poetry', 'feels', 'modern', 'stage', 'one', 'song', 'one', 'note', 'note', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'money']",N/A
