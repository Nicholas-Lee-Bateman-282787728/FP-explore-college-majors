Everything about this film seems as a serenade to the great city. This is movie about Frances  Greta Gerwig) who does not have a job or a boyfriend. She wants to be a dancer but does not  have the talent to be one. She is out of touch with modernity ( Calls a smartphone &#8216;the phone with mail on it&#8217;) but dotes on Sophie, her best friend and confidant -  she describes this friendship as the lesbian couple who does not have sex. Lurching through life, she is surprised that Sophie has started dating a boy and wants to move out, thus Frances moves in with two guys to seek company and also some help with the rent. Her life is on a constant roller coaster, a trip to Paris, getting a summer job in Poughkeepsie, the only peaceful moment she has is when she visits her parents in Sacramento.Greta Gerwig easily turns in one of the years best performance and is simply brilliant. I loved her facial expressions in almost every scene but the scene where she says goodbye to her parents at the airport -Just outstanding.Depending on your taste, you might either like or hate this movie as basically it is the story of Frances and how she comes to find her inner self and make peace with her life. The director Noah Baumbach co wrote this film with Gerwig and they have made a fine film, I normally do not like to watch black and white films but this one was just brilliant. Maybe it had to do with the fact that it captures the aimlessness, confusion  and freshness of youth so well.In my opinion one of the best films of 2013.",5,Best of 2013,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1636,"['Frances', 'Ha', 'one', 'few', 'movie', 'want', 'stay', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'till', 'day', 'die', 'Everything', 'film', 'serenade', 'great', 'city', 'movie', 'Frances', 'Greta', 'Gerwig', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'job', 'boyfriend', 'be', 'dancer', 'not', 'have', 'talent', 'be', 'one', 'touch', 'modernity', 'smartphone', '8216', 'phone', 'mail', '8217', 'Sophie', 'best', 'friend', 'confidant', 'friendship', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'sex', 'Lurching', 'life', 'surprised', 'Sophie', 'started', 'dating', 'boy', 'move', 'out', 'thus', 'Frances', 'two', 'guys', 'seek', 'company', 'also', 'help', 'rent', 'life', 'constant', 'roller', 'coaster', 'trip', 'Paris', 'getting', 'summer', 'job', 'Poughkeepsie', 'only', 'peaceful', 'moment', 'when', 'parents', 'Sacramento.Greta', 'Gerwig', 'easily', 'one', 'years', 'best', 'performance', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'loved', 'facial', 'expressions', 'almost', 'scene', 'scene', 'where', 'goodbye', 'parents', 'airport', '-Just', 'outstanding.Depending', 'taste', 'might', 'either', 'hate', 'movie', 'basically', 'story', 'Frances', 'how', 'find', 'inner', 'self', 'make', 'peace', 'life', 'director', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', 'co', 'wrote', 'film', 'Gerwig', 'have', 'made', 'fine', 'film', 'normally', 'do', 'not', 'watch', 'black', 'white', 'films', 'one', 'was', 'just', 'brilliant', 'Maybe', 'had', 'do', 'fact', 'aimlessness', 'confusion', 'freshness', 'youth', 'well.In', 'opinion', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2013']",Frances Ha
1643883,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00C7C02KC,Andrew Ellington,"[10, 10]","I&#8217;m not entirely familiar with Noah Baumbach&#8217;s body of work.  I&#8217;ve seen two of his other films, &#8216;Greenburg&#8217; and &#8216;The Squid & the Whale&#8217; and I really liked both of them.  They shared a similar tonal approach and yet &#8216;The Squid & the Whale&#8217; felt very much like a Wes Anderson film to me, while &#8216;Greenburg&#8217; felt a little more grounded in realism (not saying that it&#8217;s the better film, because it&#8217;s not).  With &#8216;Frances Ha&#8217;, Baumbach adds yet another layer to his stylistic approach and delivers something I wasn&#8217;t expecting and really responded to.This is, by far, my favorite of the three films.Briskly paced and yet filled to the brim with development, &#8216;Frances Ha&#8217; has a real firm hold on its identity and it understands how to engineer itself to be as effective as possible.  There is no fat here, the film just flows from scene to scene, and the character development here (more than one character even) feels so defined and so intended.  You understand these characters, where they started and where they are headed.  This may be my favorite character study of the year so far, and it certainly is one of the finest ensembles (so uniformly organic and honest).The film tells the story of Frances Haliday.  Frances is in her late twenties, living in New York with her best friend Sophie and attempting (however marginally) to become a dancer.  She&#8217;s stuck.  She doesn&#8217;t have the motivation necessary to grow up, and she&#8217;s apathetic (maybe too harsh a word) about it, completely content to just be a kid for life.  Like she admits, she&#8217;s not a real person yet and it shows in the way that she navigates through life.  Life is about to throw her a curveball, and jumpstart her motivation.Sophie grows up and moves on.Starting with Sophie moving out and then trickling down into every aspect of her life (broke, couch jumping, bridge burning, friend losing, job losing, dreams crushed), Frances faces some &#8216;real world problems&#8217; here that are amplified by the consistency of it all.  As she unravels, Frances weaves through her circumstances with an air of naivety, as if it really isn&#8217;t sinking in how desperate she&#8217;s become, until it all comes together in the end.  Broaching some really intricate themes, &#8216;Frances Ha&#8217; really finds ways to build such a well-rounded and relatable character, despite her obvious quirks and grating persona.  Yes, Frances is hard to take at times and yet she is so believable.  This is thanks, in large part, to Gerwig&#8217;s astonishing performance, but this role is perfect for her.  What appears like an easy transition though (just play quirky) is harder than it seems, as Greta has to shade Frances with so many unsaid emotions, and she does a wonderful job of allowing Frances&#8217;s reaction shots to speak for themselves.I want to applaud Baumbach, who shows so much style and grace while directing this film.  It could have been very average or run of the mill, but instead he imparts a real radiance to the film.  His progression of story reminded me of early Woody Allen, and the way he builds his premise reminded me of the classic comedies of yesteryear.  In fact, the decision to shoot in B&W; was rather inspired because it called to mind those quirky comedies of the 30&#8217;s.Not only is the film beautiful to look at, but it has a real soul, a real &#8216;beat&#8217;.",5,This beautiful film has a real identity&#8230;,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,3488,"['8217', 'not', 'entirely', 'familiar', 'Noah', 'Baumbach', '8217', 'body', 'work', '8217', 'seen', 'two', 'other', 'films', '8216', 'Greenburg', '8217', '8216', 'Squid', 'Whale', '8217', 'really', 'liked', 'shared', 'similar', 'tonal', 'approach', 'yet', '8216', 'Squid', 'Whale', '8217', 'felt', 'very', 'much', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'film', '8216', 'Greenburg', '8217', 'felt', 'little', 'more', 'grounded', 'realism', 'not', 'saying', '8217', 's', 'better', 'film', '8217', 'not', '8216', 'Frances', 'Ha', '8217', 'Baumbach', 'yet', 'layer', 'stylistic', 'approach', 'delivers', 'something', 'wasn', '8217', 'expecting', 'really', 'responded', 'to.This', 'far', 'favorite', 'three', 'films.Briskly', 'paced', 'yet', 'filled', 'brim', 'development', '8216', 'Frances', 'Ha', '8217', 'real', 'firm', 'hold', 'identity', 'how', 'engineer', 'be', 'as', 'effective', 'possible', 'fat', 'here', 'film', 'just', 'scene', 'scene', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'more', 'one', 'character', 'even', 'feels', 'so', 'defined', 'so', 'intended', 'understand', 'characters', 'where', 'started', 'where', 'are', 'headed', 'may', 'be', 'favorite', 'character', 'study', 'year', 'so', 'far', 'certainly', 'one', 'finest', 'ensembles', 'so', 'uniformly', 'organic', 'honest', '.The', 'film', 'story', 'Frances', 'Haliday', 'Frances', 'late', 'twenties', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'best', 'friend', 'Sophie', 'attempting', 'however', 'marginally', 'become', 'dancer', '8217', 's', 'stuck', 'doesn', '8217', 'have', 'motivation', 'necessary', 'grow', 'up', '8217', 'apathetic', 'maybe', 'too', 'harsh', 'word', 'completely', 'content', 'just', 'be', 'kid', 'life', '8217', 'not', 'real', 'person', 'yet', 'way', 'life', 'Life', 'throw', 'curveball', 'jumpstart', 'motivation.Sophie', 'up', 'moves', 'on.Starting', 'Sophie', 'moving', 'out', 'then', 'trickling', 'down', 'aspect', 'life', 'broke', 'couch', 'jumping', 'bridge', 'burning', 'friend', 'losing', 'job', 'losing', 'dreams', 'crushed', 'Frances', '8216', 'real', 'world', 'problems', '8217', 'here', 'are', 'amplified', 'consistency', 'Frances', 'weaves', 'circumstances', 'air', 'naivety', 'really', 'isn', '8217', 'sinking', 'how', 'desperate', '8217', 'become', 'together', 'end', 'Broaching', 'really', 'intricate', 'themes', '8216', 'Frances', 'Ha', '8217', 'really', 'ways', 'build', 'such', 'well-rounded', 'relatable', 'character', 'obvious', 'quirks', 'grating', 'persona', 'Yes', 'Frances', 'hard', 'take', 'times', 'yet', 'so', 'believable', 'thanks', 'large', 'part', 'Gerwig', '8217', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'role', 'perfect', 'What', 'easy', 'transition', 'just', 'play', 'quirky', 'harder', 'Greta', 'shade', 'Frances', 'so', 'many', 'unsaid', 'emotions', 'wonderful', 'job', 'allowing', 'Frances', '8217', 'reaction', 'shots', 'speak', 'themselves.I', 'want', 'applaud', 'Baumbach', 'who', 'so', 'much', 'style', 'grace', 'directing', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'average', 'run', 'mill', 'instead', 'real', 'radiance', 'film', 'progression', 'story', 'reminded', 'early', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'way', 'premise', 'reminded', 'classic', 'comedies', 'yesteryear', 'fact', 'decision', 'shoot', 'B', 'W', 'was', 'rather', 'inspired', 'called', 'mind', 'quirky', 'comedies', '30', '8217', 's.Not', 'only', 'film', 'beautiful', 'look', 'real', 'soul', 'real', '8216', '8217']",Frances Ha

1643885,A3I0PYI3Q2AXMQ,B00C7C02KC,"C. Coulter ""Writer, Prof - GWU""","[6, 6]","I'll be honest. I was never a Noah Baumbach fan. The Squid and the Whale was over-rated to me, and, while solid, that previous Baumbach effort -- let's not forget NB has co-written some solid fare with Wes Anderson -- had the critics loving it because it had enough dark material, enough easy cynicism to satisfy the jaded mass of ex-English majors filling the dying papers. FRANCES HA, on the other hand, is FRESH, bright, fun and serious in an entirely different way. We see this young girl's friendship with her ex-college gal pal (&#34;the other her/me&#34;) fall apart and alter as life comes along, with careers and disparate levels of success. The roomie has a relationship. The roomie has a great job. And Frances has to find her way, in that unforgiving career: dance/choreography. And let me tell you, having met the fallen bodies from Julliard and the Manhattan School of Music and watching them adjust to the rigors of this less than forgiving world is something I know well, but this film has a charm, an aplomb, a simple, lovely cadence that gives and gives. Seeing her switch roommates, return to her college roots, suffer the worst kind of &#34;I can do it&#34; world travel to Paris, and then land on her feet, without all the cliches of &#34;Hey, everything is sudden success; she is a choreographer for SNL now'&#34; is a thing of beauty. I loathe the fact that this upbeat work is not Oscar-nominated. And sure, thinking of The Prof in The Squid and the Whale, yes, I know Oscars are for Philistines :) But, honestly, from twirling to Bowie's &#34;Modern Love&#34; in Manhattan to 'fake-fighting,' I LOVED every moment. It does have a formlessness at first, and then you see that it's more than slice of life; it's life rendered damned well, and France's transitions are heroic. There are so many sweet moments, such as her brief visit home at the holidays, rendered in a series of quick cuts and warm images. Gerwig is great. The cinematography: majestic.

I didn't feel the full emotional impact for several hours and I'm still somewhat shaken by the script. I'm completely at a loss as to what makes critics and viewers think this film is a comedy. Of course, there are lots of sequences that have the sort of comic quality that Andy Kaufman had - what you might mistake for comedy is agony presented in a self-conscious ironic persona. But the film is tragic, and all the more so because it's so real - I've met so many of these characters. Just to put out my thesis, Frances is a 27 year old from a loving middle class family in Sacramento. She's a lovely, warm, church-going woman when she visits her parents who sings hymns with genuine fervor at their Unitarian church. Their house is a humble one on a block where all the houses look exactly alike. Frances went to what appears to be Vassar, where she met and bonded with another young woman. In fact, they love each other very deeply. Frances' friend is sort of a &#34;Leaning In&#34; type, but Frances studies dance. Both move to...of course...Brooklyn. And here is what the film is about. This is a love story, but a love so far platonic. Frances believes she is straight, but if a man even touches her on her shoulder she shrieks and pulls away. Her male BFFs jokingly call her &#34;undateable&#34;. Frances' love interest, her girlfriend, has no emotional desire to marry, but dates men and becomes engaged to a banker type. Their love for each other may never be fulfilled. Critically, when Frances arrives in New York, she finds herself in alien terrain, with people unlike anything she has ever encountered. For a while she lives with two young men, about 5 years younger than her, both of them trust fund babies living rough. This is so real - I know a Millennial billionaire's daughter who grew up on Park Avenue in the building where Katie Couric lived who dresses in hideous thrift store clothing and lives with roomies in a hole in Astoria. And so Frances, the Brooklyn version, who earns nothing failing as a dancer, affects a gawky persona that most people find quite uncomfortable. In any case, this part is what the critics think the film is about, but it isn't. The film is about whether Frances and her friend will ever complete their love for each other. The film should have an ambiguous ending, or a sad one, but because Scott Rudin produced it a ridiculous happy ending is tacked on that almost destroys the integrity of the movie. This is also very much a commentary on the New York 20-something scene. If you understand the scripted character Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig have written for Frances, this is a deeply upsetting story.

1643889,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B00C7C02KC,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[1, 1]","FRANCES HA has a straightforward plot: our eponymous hero (Greta Gerwig) aspires to become a dancer yet finds herself perpetually thwarted by circumstances.  Unable to find a steady boyfriend, she takes pleasure in sustaining a platonic friendship with Sophie (Mickey Sumner), who fails to reciprocate, despite numerous protestations of love.  Frances drifts through life, taking a succession of dead-end jobs and living with different people (she even returns to her parents in California), until she is given the opportunity to choreograph a dance of her own, through which she discovers fulfillment at last.  Shot on a shoestring in black-and-white, Noah Baumbach's film has a free-wheeling spirit reminiscent of mid-1960s British films: despite her reversals, Frances sustains her basic optimism as she roams the streets of New York.  Her joie-de-vivre contrasts with Sophie's more mundane existence - although more successful in career terms, Sophie ends up in a relationship with Patch (Patrick Heusinger) that condemns her to a life of disappointment.  The only problem with FRANCES HA is that it ends up being slightly manipulative: Baumbach piles on Frances' agonies (even sending her to Paris for a disastrous weekend) without exploring her character in any great depth.

Things aren't going well with Frances Halladay. She can't seem to get into a good relationship. She's still an understudy in the dance troop with which she performs and her best friend is moving to Japan. So she's performing a soft spiral downward. What to do?There's a lot going on here.Greta Gerwig (Frances) wrote the script along with director Noah Baumbach and she certainly has something, or somethings, in mind. Part of it deals with communication. Through mass and social media we've become so self aware we have a difficult time communicating honestly with one another.We always seem to see ourselves from the outside, as though we're viewing ourselves on TV. And relationships have gotten weird. For instance: Frances and Sophie are in love with each other but are not lesbian. I don't know if I've ever seen this depicted quite this way in film. They are really all each other needs in their lives. And Frances is an artist at heart. She is a dancer but doesn't seem to be very good. But she might be a heck of a choreographer. It were as though Van Gogh himself couldn't paint but could direct others to create masterpieces. All these things, and others, do create both a story and character arc but it's more subtle. You have to dig for it to organize what appears to be a big mess on the outside. But that's Frances' life. Moving from one place to another, one situation to another and one job to another.This is a really nifty flick. Director Noah Baumbach, like most directors, has a spotty history. But his collaboration with Gerwig has struck on something.

She has what seems an amazingly close relationship with her roommate and best friend Sophie (a terrific Mickey Summer), but it all comes crashing down when Sophie decides to move out (and maybe grow up) for a better apartment (not as crazy as that sounds in NYC), leaving Frances suddenly uprooted and alone.We follow Frances as she pin-balls through places to live and people to connect with (or not), seeming too childlike for her own good, and unable to take control of her life. But she never sinks so low that she loses the spark that makes us want good things for her, in spite of her continually getting in her own way.While the film has some very touching moments, and generally excellent acting and writing, something in it made me feel held a bit at arms length. For all the joy and sorrow in Frances&#8217; life, I felt more like a clinical observer and less like a participant than I wanted to. And while some of Baumbach&#8217;s nods to French new wave film-making work wonderfully (the high-spirited musical romp Frances takes down New York streets is wildly infectious), some of them, like the constant use of music from those seminal1960s films as score was, for me, distracting and too self-conscious. Frances is a good enough character, and Baumbach a talented enough story teller that it the film didn&#8217;t need such heavy handed style laid over it.Still, a unique, if flawed film about a unique if flawed character.

Unfortunately, Greta is not going to make it as a dancer, but there is hope that she could become a successful choreographer &#8230;if only she can recognize that fact.Her dream starts to fall apart when her best friend and roommate (Mickey Sumner) decides to move out of their apartment in favor of a better place with another roommate.  This is the first of a series of disappointments for Frances who finds herself moving from place to place as her finances and job opportunities dwindle.It&#8217;s possible to view Frances as a &#8220;train wreck,&#8221; particularly when she uses a new credit card to purchase a two-day trip to Paris where she finds herself virtually alone.  Finally, the girl/woman seems to get her head on straight and she seizes an opportunity that may not get her &#8220;to the stars,&#8221; but might wind her up in the &#8220;treetops&#8221;.Written (with Gerwig) and directed by Noah Baumbach, this black-and-white &#8220;romantic&#8221; comedy is reminiscent in its style of Woody Allen&#8217;s MANHATTAN, as well as some of the French New Wave films of the 1960s.  It&#8217;s a sweet portrait of one of many lost souls in New York City, hoping to find her way.  As an audience, we&#8217;re certainly pulling for her.The 2-disc Criterion set presents the film in a new high-def digital master, approved by Baumbach.  Extras on both discs include a conversation between the director and Peter Bogdanovich, a conversation between actress/filmmaker Sarah Polley and Gerwig, and a conversation with Baumbach and others about the look of FRANCES HA.

It may contain spoilers.I've seen several of Noah Baumbach's films as well as those of his girlfriend and star in this film Greta Gerwig. I've always found Gerwig's characters to be a bit odd but still very likable. This is her best film yet.She plays Frances, a 28 year old understudy at a small New York ballet company. She's not very good, but she doesn't know it. Her best friend and roommate, Sophie (Sting's daughter Mickey Sumner) have an unusual friendship but Sophie decides to move in with her boyfriend (Michael Esper). This leaves Sophie in a bit of a lurch as their lease is up for renewal. She temporarily moves in with a couple dudes (Adam Driver and Michael Zegen) who are friends of a friend. Eventually she loses her position in the ballet because of financial cutbacks.As Frances sputters away from her dream of being a dancer and yes, finding a guy - friends joke she's undatable - she finds refuge with her parents played by Gerwig's real parents. She then moves on to her alma mater in upstate New York to do some meager jobs, but gets room and board. At times you want to yell at Frances to get it together, but then you realize that is what she's trying to do.

1643906,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00C7C02KC,Paul Allaer,"[31, 37]","""Frances Ha"" (2013 release; 86 min.) brings the story of Frances (played by Greta Gerwig), a 27 yr. woman living in New York with an iffy job in a dance company. As the movie opens we see Frances spending time with her best friend Sophie (played by Mickey Sumner, a/k/a the daughter of Sting). When Frances' boyfriend asks her to move in with him, she refuses, saying she cannot get out of her lease (but in reality simply wanting to stay with Sophie). The boyfriend breaks up with her. Shortly thereafter Sophie surprises Frances when she wants to movie out to her dream apartment in Tribeca (""I'm not leaving you! I'm just moving neighborhoods!""). This starts a series of events that seemingly puts Frances in a downward spiral. To tell you much more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first and foremost, this is an out-of-the-park homerun for director Noah Baumbach (previous efforts include The Squid and the Whale, Margot At the Wedding, and Greenberg) and Greta Gerwig, who has a nice string of movies going, including last year's delightful Lola Versus. Baumbach and Gerwig met on the set of Greenberg, and co-wrote ""Frances Ha"". The movie is charming from start to finish, yet never gets silly or sentimental. It's a slice of life as experienced by this young woman with big dreams and little or no money. The movie is filmed in delicious black and white, which of course immediately invites a comparison to Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"", which covers a lot of the same territory and in the same city. And guess what: ""Frances Ha"" stands up very nicely to the Woody Allen classic. ""Frances Ha"" places two songs with great effect, David Bowie's ""Modern Love"" as Frances runs through the streets of New York, and even better, Hot Chocolate's ""Every 1's a Winner"", playing as Frances has a disastrous trip to Paris. Just great! Lastly, if you are wondering where the movie's title comes from, all will be revealed in the very last scene of the movie. This movie is billed as a ""dramatic comedy"" and I'm not sure what that really means. Yes there are a lot of funny scenes in it, but not the kind that make you laugh-out-loud, but instead make you chuckle with inside joy.Bottom line, as I watched this movie today, I sensed that times was flying by and I so wished that the movie wouldn't end quite yet, as I loved ""hanging out"" with Frances and her friends. I am trying to find flaws in this movie, but honestly cannot come up with any. In Hollywood terms, this movie was made for a nickle and a dime, but no matter: for me this is the best movie of the year so far, and I see a LOT of movies. I am happy to say that the screening at the art-house theatre here in Cincinnati today was very well attended (and it's playing on two screens no less, a rarity at this theatre), so quality may overcome after all. If you are in the mood for a top notch movie that does not involve mega-explosions or saving the world, you cannot go wrong with this.

Frances is kind of dizzy, with the kind of self-attitude that tends to irritate people. Her irritated boyfriend wants her to move in with him, but she declines because she wants to stay with Sophie. Then Sophie moves to another apartment with another friend, and Frances is left to figure out her place in the world alone.There&#8217;s not a whole lot of plot here; it&#8217;s just a series of people who let Frances stay with them for awhile. It&#8217;s an interesting look at the hipster lifestyle from the point of view of someone who can&#8217;t quite afford it.The whole movie is filmed in black-and-white. Combine that with a quirky sensibility and rather unlikable characters, and it&#8217;s kind of like a Jim Jarmusch film. But not as boring, and with prettier people.I usually don't go for films like this, but this one works - mostly because the character of Frances is so charming and funny and stupid and irritating all at the same time. Actress Greta Gerwig really nails her role. And anyone that didn&#8217;t go right into their dream job after college can relate to parts of it. While it is about the search for love and responsibility, this movie is more realistic than most of its type &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t pretend that love saves the day or that everyone lives happily ever after.

1643910,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00C7C02KC,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 1]","****1/2Noah Baumbach's ""Frances Ha"" has the freeform charm and exuberance of all those independent American and European films from the late 1950s and '60s about unfettered youth finding their way in the world. The comparison is made most striking by the gorgeous black-and-white cinematography that Sam Levy has provided for the film.Caught in that awkward period where one has not completely shrugged off the dependency of childhood yet not quite attained the full independence of adulthood, Frances is a 27-year-old dancer who's just a little too gangly, a little too relationship-phobic and a little too broke to feel truly secure about herself and her future. She and her best friend, Sophie, a publisher for Random House, are so close that they frequently refer to themselves jokingly as a single person and as a lesbian couple who never has sex. They share an apartment in Brooklyn - that is until Sophie moves in with another friend in another part of town, leaving Frances to secure lodgings with two fellows, Lev and Benji. There's a touch of ""Jules and Jim"" in the relationship between Frances and the men, a bit of ""Georgy Girl"" in Frances' bouts with insecurity and high-spirited kookiness. And it all feels vaguely Bohemian (Lev is a sculptor and rides motorcycles and Benji is a TV comedy writer) as any tale of young folk living in New York certainly should.Nothing quite turns out the way Frances wants them to, not her career moves, not her relationships; even an impromptu trip to The City of Lights turns out to be a dud. Rather than admit to little and not-so-little defeats in her life, Francis spins a web of fibs designed to convince others that she's doing just fine, thank you very much. But the defining feature of Frances' life is the growing jealousy she feels towards Sophie's fianc&eacute; who seems to be taking her best buddy and emotional ""life partner"" away from her.Yet, all this makes ""Frances Ha"" sound like some heavy-breathing tragedy, when nothing indeed could be further from the truth. It is, in fact, a delightfully droll and fetching comedy that doesn't over-rely on quirkiness as so many low budget independent comedies are wont to do. As written by Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, the screenplay finds a beautiful balance between poignancy and humor, highbrow wit and lowbrow farce. And as Frances, Gerwig brings to life one of the most purely appealing characters we've come across in quite some time, a flighty free-spirit whose self-consciousness and keen powers of observation keep her at least partially grounded in reality. She's matched in performance by Mickey Sumner as Sophie, Adam Driver as Lev and Michael Zegen as Benji.Together they and Baumbach have made a film that, though it may look like an art house oddity at first glance, has enough broad appeal to pull it into the mainstream.",4,A perceptive comic look at youth in the city,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,2841,"['****1/2Noah', 'Baumbach', 'Frances', 'Ha', 'freeform', 'charm', 'exuberance', 'independent', 'American', 'European', 'films', 'late', '1950s', ""'60s"", 'unfettered', 'youth', 'finding', 'way', 'world', 'comparison', 'made', 'most', 'striking', 'gorgeous', 'black-and-white', 'cinematography', 'Sam', 'Levy', 'provided', 'film.Caught', 'awkward', 'period', 'where', 'one', 'not', 'completely', 'shrugged', 'off', 'dependency', 'childhood', 'yet', 'not', 'quite', 'attained', 'full', 'independence', 'adulthood', 'Frances', '27-year-old', 'dancer', 'who', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'gangly', 'little', 'too', 'relationship-phobic', 'little', 'too', 'broke', 'feel', 'truly', 'secure', 'herself', 'future', 'best', 'friend', 'Sophie', 'publisher', 'Random', 'House', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'frequently', 'refer', 'jokingly', 'single', 'person', 'lesbian', 'couple', 'who', 'never', 'sex', 'share', 'apartment', 'Brooklyn', 'Sophie', 'moves', 'friend', 'part', 'town', 'leaving', 'Frances', 'secure', 'lodgings', 'two', 'fellows', 'Lev', 'Benji', 'touch', 'Jules', 'Jim', 'relationship', 'Frances', 'men', 'bit', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'Frances', 'bouts', 'insecurity', 'high-spirited', 'kookiness', 'feels', 'vaguely', 'Bohemian', 'Lev', 'sculptor', 'rides', 'motorcycles', 'Benji', 'TV', 'comedy', 'writer', 'tale', 'young', 'folk', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'certainly', 'should.Nothing', 'quite', 'out', 'way', 'Frances', 'not', 'career', 'moves', 'not', 'relationships', 'even', 'impromptu', 'trip', 'City', 'Lights', 'out', 'be', 'dud', 'Rather', 'admit', 'little', 'not-so-little', 'defeats', 'life', 'Francis', 'web', 'fibs', 'designed', 'convince', 'others', 'doing', 'just', 'fine', 'thank', 'very', 'much', 'defining', 'feature', 'Frances', 'life', 'growing', 'jealousy', 'towards', 'Sophie', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'who', 'be', 'taking', 'best', 'buddy', 'emotional', 'life', 'partner', 'away', 'her.Yet', 'Frances', 'Ha', 'sound', 'heavy-breathing', 'tragedy', 'when', 'nothing', 'indeed', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'fact', 'delightfully', 'droll', 'fetching', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'over-rely', 'quirkiness', 'so', 'many', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'comedies', 'are', 'wont', 'do', 'written', 'Baumbach', 'Greta', 'Gerwig', 'screenplay', 'beautiful', 'balance', 'poignancy', 'humor', 'highbrow', 'wit', 'lowbrow', 'farce', 'Frances', 'Gerwig', 'life', 'one', 'most', 'purely', 'appealing', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'come', 'quite', 'time', 'flighty', 'free-spirit', 'self-consciousness', 'keen', 'powers', 'observation', 'keep', 'least', 'partially', 'grounded', 'reality', 'matched', 'performance', 'Mickey', 'Sumner', 'Sophie', 'Adam', 'Driver', 'Lev', 'Michael', 'Zegen', 'Benji.Together', 'Baumbach', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'may', 'look', 'art', 'house', 'oddity', 'first', 'glance', 'enough', 'broad', 'appeal', 'pull', 'mainstream']",Frances Ha

1643912,A3PZ0H4BMZOFRT,B00C7C02KC,ShowBizBuff,"[0, 0]","Greta Gerwig, even in a field crowded with great performances this year - is still receiving potential Oscar buzz for FRANCES HA, and after seeing the film I can see why. She both co-wrote and stars in this black-and-white comedy, set in New York City, that is the story of a young woman in her late twenties, Frances, who doesn't quite have her own place, isn't quite a dancer, and isn't quite talking to her best friend anymore.In other words, it's a completely realistic portrait of a young woman who has yet to grow up. Frances wants to be a dancer, yet isn't quite talented enough so she remains an apprentice for a small dance company where she occasionally mentors or even teaches kids, while working on a ""career"" that will never happen. When he best friend and roommate Sophie moves out on her to live in Chelsea, Frances ends up bumming a room from a pair of their guy friends, but never truly has a place of her own. What the film is about is this girl, and how she remains sweet and lighthearted and positive even while deluding herself, and how (or if) she learns to grow up and really fend for herself as the realities of life - and living in New York City - tumble in. Greta Gerwig is brilliant here, pulling it back just when you almost feel Frances could get annoyingly trite and making you hope she will learn to adjust and be okay. The black and white photography actually enhances the film, giving it an almost Woody Allen feel. Sweet movie, thanks to Gerwig and a nice supporting cast that includes Adam Driver and Michael Zegen as her guyfriend roommates, and Mickey Sumner as Sophie (note: Gerwig's own parents play Frances' parents in the film, a very nice touch).",4,"Sweet portrait of a female Peter Pan, made wonderful by Gerwig's star-making performance",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,1688,"['Greta', 'Gerwig', 'even', 'field', 'crowded', 'great', 'performances', 'year', 'still', 'receiving', 'potential', 'Oscar', 'buzz', 'FRANCES', 'HA', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'co-wrote', 'stars', 'black-and-white', 'comedy', 'set', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'late', 'twenties', 'Frances', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'have', 'own', 'place', ""n't"", 'quite', 'dancer', ""n't"", 'quite', 'talking', 'best', 'friend', 'anymore.In', 'other', 'words', 'completely', 'realistic', 'portrait', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'yet', 'grow', 'up', 'Frances', 'be', 'dancer', ""n't"", 'quite', 'talented', 'enough', 'apprentice', 'small', 'dance', 'company', 'where', 'occasionally', 'mentors', 'even', 'teaches', 'kids', 'working', 'career', 'will', 'never', 'happen', 'When', 'best', 'friend', 'roommate', 'Sophie', 'out', 'live', 'Chelsea', 'Frances', 'up', 'bumming', 'room', 'pair', 'guy', 'friends', 'never', 'truly', 'place', 'own', 'What', 'film', 'about', 'girl', 'how', 'sweet', 'lighthearted', 'positive', 'even', 'deluding', 'how', 'grow', 'up', 'really', 'fend', 'realities', 'life', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'tumble', 'Greta', 'Gerwig', 'brilliant', 'here', 'pulling', 'back', 'just', 'when', 'almost', 'feel', 'Frances', 'could', 'get', 'annoyingly', 'trite', 'making', 'hope', 'will', 'learn', 'adjust', 'be', 'okay', 'black', 'white', 'photography', 'actually', 'film', 'giving', 'almost', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'feel', 'Sweet', 'movie', 'thanks', 'Gerwig', 'nice', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Adam', 'Driver', 'Michael', 'Zegen', 'guyfriend', 'roommates', 'Mickey', 'Sumner', 'Sophie', 'note', 'Gerwig', 'own', 'parents', 'play', 'Frances', 'parents', 'film', 'very', 'nice', 'touch']",Frances Ha

1643914,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00C7C02KC,Turfseer,"[11, 20]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0Noah Baumbach co-wrote 'Frances Ha' with his current significant other, Greta Gerwig, the actress who plays the title role. It's Baumbach's take on a 27 year old aspiring dancer/choreographer who just can't seem to get herself together. Slate Magazine's Dane Stevens describes Frances as ""childlike and disorganized."" Stephen Holden of The Times has an even more prescient descriptor, describing Frances as one who operates under a sense of ""entitlement."" The film is shot in black and white and it reminds me of the 1962 French New Wave flick, 'Cleo from 5 to 7'. While 'Frances' is not filmed in real time like 'Cleo', it has the same feel: expansive shots of the care-free, largely self-absorbed protagonist, who prances about, highlighted by one urban backdrop after another. Baumbach clearly wants us to link his film to the spirit of the French New Wave, as he employs the famed French film composer, Georges Delerue, to provide much of the film's soundtrack.When we first meet Frances, she's living in a Brooklyn apartment with her best friend, Sophie, who recites 'The Story of Us'--a whimsical tale of the two young women engaging in a ""world takeover"". However, as we break into Act II, Frances feels betrayed, when Sophie announces she's moving to a new apartment share which Frances can't possibly afford (Frances is an intern at a small dance company).Frances briefly resides with two younger guys, one of whom classifies her as ""undateable"". Frances often drinks too much and makes inappropriate comments in various social situations. Frances eventually travels to Sacramento to visit her parents and later, takes a particularly ill-advised trip to Paris, funded by a credit-card. All of this proves quite repetitious as Dana Stevens remarks in Slate: ""There are too many scenes in a row that make the same point--Frances is a creative but lovable flake who's her own worst enemy."" Just like in Cleo from 5 to 7, the protagonist's journey is not as important as allowing the viewer to take in the wonderful ambiance and atmosphere. Baumbach indeed is a virtuoso when it comes to highlighting Frances' myopia through visual (non-dialogue) scenes.Frances finally ends up as an RA at summer dance camp at Vassar College where she runs into now-married Sophie, who's flown in with her straight-arrow husband, who's now working in Japan. Sophie hates being in Japan and is unhappy in her marriage. Perhaps here Baumbach is foreshadowing Frances' eventual triumph: the struggling artist trumps those who opt for more traditional pathways (while Sophie seemingly is Frances' social better, Baumbach makes it clear, that's not the way it ends up).I can't help bring 'Cleo from 5 to 7' up again. Just like Frances, 'Cleo' goes from complete self-absorption to liberation. In Cleo's case, a sweet-talking soldier and an oncologists' positive diagnosis, bring her back to reality and happiness. In Frances' case, it's not really clear what got her to change her attitude after all the self-defeating, myopic behavior. By accepting the job at the dance company and then establishing her own client&egrave;le of students (creating her own dance school), Frances suddenly finds redemption.'Frances Ha' has some sharp performances, particularly Ms. Gerwig in the title role along with Mickey Sumner as Sophie. Mr. Baumbach's visual style and direction is a worthy throwback to the French New Wave era. Nonetheless, some may find the non-conformist Frances' machinations to be too one-note and grating throughout most of the film. Baumbach is more forgiving and suggests that Frances' late maturity is normal and part and parcel of normal young adult development.",2,French New Wave tribute scores visually but its one-note protagonist and situations are less compelling,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",2013,3723,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5', '5.0Noah', 'Baumbach', 'co-wrote', ""'Frances"", 'Ha', 'current', 'significant', 'other', 'Greta', 'Gerwig', 'actress', 'who', 'title', 'role', 'Baumbach', 'take', '27', 'year', 'old', 'aspiring', 'dancer/choreographer', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'together', 'Slate', 'Magazine', 'Dane', 'Stevens', 'Frances', 'childlike', 'disorganized', 'Stephen', 'Holden', 'Times', 'even', 'more', 'prescient', 'descriptor', 'describing', 'Frances', 'one', 'who', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'film', 'shot', 'black', 'white', '1962', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'flick', '5', '7', ""'Frances"", 'not', 'filmed', 'real', 'time', ""'Cleo"", 'same', 'feel', 'expansive', 'shots', 'care-free', 'largely', 'self-absorbed', 'protagonist', 'who', 'about', 'highlighted', 'one', 'urban', 'backdrop', 'Baumbach', 'clearly', 'link', 'film', 'spirit', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'famed', 'French', 'film', 'composer', 'Georges', 'Delerue', 'provide', 'much', 'film', 'soundtrack.When', 'first', 'meet', 'Frances', 'living', 'Brooklyn', 'apartment', 'best', 'friend', 'Sophie', 'who', ""'The"", 'Story', 'Us', 'whimsical', 'tale', 'two', 'young', 'women', 'engaging', 'world', 'takeover', 'However', 'break', 'Act', 'II', 'Frances', 'betrayed', 'when', 'Sophie', 'moving', 'new', 'apartment', 'share', 'Frances', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'afford', 'Frances', 'intern', 'small', 'dance', 'company', 'briefly', 'resides', 'two', 'younger', 'guys', 'one', 'whom', 'undateable', 'Frances', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'inappropriate', 'comments', 'various', 'social', 'situations', 'Frances', 'eventually', 'travels', 'Sacramento', 'visit', 'parents', 'later', 'particularly', 'ill-advised', 'trip', 'Paris', 'funded', 'credit-card', 'quite', 'repetitious', 'Dana', 'Stevens', 'remarks', 'Slate', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'scenes', 'row', 'make', 'same', 'point', 'Frances', 'creative', 'lovable', 'flake', 'who', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Just', 'Cleo', '5', '7', 'protagonist', 'journey', 'not', 'as', 'important', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'take', 'wonderful', 'ambiance', 'atmosphere', 'Baumbach', 'indeed', 'virtuoso', 'when', 'highlighting', 'Frances', 'myopia', 'visual', 'non-dialogue', 'scenes.Frances', 'finally', 'up', 'RA', 'summer', 'dance', 'camp', 'Vassar', 'College', 'where', 'now-married', 'Sophie', 'who', 'flown', 'straight-arrow', 'husband', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'Japan', 'Sophie', 'being', 'Japan', 'unhappy', 'marriage', 'Perhaps', 'here', 'Baumbach', 'foreshadowing', 'Frances', 'eventual', 'triumph', 'struggling', 'artist', 'trumps', 'who', 'opt', 'more', 'traditional', 'pathways', 'Sophie', 'seemingly', 'Frances', 'social', 'better', 'Baumbach', 'clear', 'not', 'way', 'up', '.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'bring', ""'Cleo"", '5', '7', 'up', 'again', 'Just', 'Frances', ""'Cleo"", 'complete', 'self-absorption', 'liberation', 'Cleo', 'case', 'sweet-talking', 'soldier', 'oncologists', 'positive', 'diagnosis', 'bring', 'back', 'reality', 'happiness', 'Frances', 'case', 'not', 'really', 'clear', 'what', 'got', 'change', 'attitude', 'self-defeating', 'myopic', 'behavior', 'accepting', 'job', 'dance', 'company', 'then', 'establishing', 'own', 'client', 'egrave', 'le', 'students', 'creating', 'own', 'dance', 'school', 'Frances', 'suddenly', 'redemption', ""'Frances"", 'Ha', 'sharp', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Ms.', 'Gerwig', 'title', 'role', 'Mickey', 'Sumner', 'Sophie', 'Mr.', 'Baumbach', 'visual', 'style', 'direction', 'worthy', 'throwback', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'era', 'Nonetheless', 'may', 'find', 'non-conformist', 'Frances', 'machinations', 'be', 'too', 'one-note', 'grating', 'most', 'film', 'Baumbach', 'more', 'forgiving', 'Frances', 'late', 'maturity', 'normal', 'part', 'parcel', 'normal', 'young', 'adult', 'development']",Frances Ha
