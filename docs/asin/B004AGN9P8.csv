1393391,A3JWVMLYSYQOSJ,B004AGN9P8,"AlwaysLearning ""Happy2Be""","[2, 2]",This film from the1950s demonstrated to me how you don't need fancy special effects to create a compelling film.  I like realistic characters and this film had them.  It showed the horror of the klan's activities and showed how most of them probably thought of it as a &#34;boys night out&#34;.  It also showed the interesting issues around &#34;passing for white&#34;.  Climatic ending.

""Fat Loser""","[0, 0]","Poor acting, cheap production values, bad cinematography and all the other wannabe movie critic sounding mumbo jumbo words aside, this is a very fascinating film. It came out in 1966, back when Blacks had to sit in the back of the bus, despite the passing of the Civil Rights Act two years earlier.  I'm shocked that this movie got made, much less released. I'm even more shocked that white people agreed to be in this film. I've developed a new respect for Ted V. Mikels after watching this movie. It took some steel balls to take such a risk. There's no beating around the bush here, its a no holds bar cry against the bigotry and violence by whites toward blacks. They made a big deal about Captain Kirk kissing Uhura, but this is a whole new level. I think this movie makes a more powerful statement then &#34;Mississippi Burning&#34;. Remember, that film was made when it was safe and trendy to take a stand. This movie could have gotten Mr. Mikels lynched. No matter what you think of the film, you have to give the director and the actors credit for their bravery.",4,Ballsey!,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",2014,1071,"['Poor', 'acting', 'cheap', 'production', 'values', 'bad', 'cinematography', 'other', 'wannabe', 'movie', 'critic', 'sounding', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'words', 'aside', 'very', 'fascinating', 'film', 'came', 'out', '1966', 'back', 'when', 'Blacks', 'had', 'sit', 'back', 'bus', 'passing', 'Civil', 'Rights', 'Act', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', ""'m"", 'shocked', 'movie', 'got', 'made', 'much', 'less', 'released', ""'m"", 'even', 'more', 'shocked', 'white', 'people', 'agreed', 'be', 'film', ""'ve"", 'developed', 'new', 'respect', 'Ted', 'V.', 'Mikels', 'watching', 'movie', 'took', 'steel', 'balls', 'take', 'risk', 'beating', 'bush', 'here', 'bar', 'cry', 'bigotry', 'violence', 'whites', 'blacks', 'made', 'big', 'deal', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'kissing', 'Uhura', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'powerful', 'statement', 'then', '34', 'Mississippi', 'Burning', '34', 'Remember', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'when', 'was', 'safe', 'trendy', 'take', 'stand', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'Mr.', 'Mikels', 'lynched', 'matter', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'have', 'give', 'director', 'actors', 'credit', 'bravery']",N/A

This movie was way ahead of it's time. A movie with this subject matter, to be made and released in 1966, had me going ""Whoa!"" to myself. I don't know how well it did at the theaters (if any theaters dared to show it). But, I'm sure it raised eyebrows.
