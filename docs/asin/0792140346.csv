126029,AC6QS971QZWS3,0792140346,acidburn,"[0, 0]","Wow. My husband urged me to watch this to see Ed Norton in his beginnings. I'm still in shock over how fantastic he portrayed this character- this is the kind of stuff they really should be handing awards out for.This story is beautifully written and executed right on cue. Richard Gere's knack for suave isn't lacking, and Laura Linney plays off of him to build her own cemented character. From the beginning of the movie, Norton's character is simple and slow, and generally while the movie revolves around him, he doesn't really seem the center of attention. While the chaos swirls around him, he seems like an innocent bystander, a victim of life. Yes, he was hurt. Yes, he is damaged. But he s-s-s-seems so gentle.Hold your breath until the end of the movie. Seriously, my jaw stayed open for a solid 60 seconds.If you are interested in psychological traumas, messed up priests, and hardcore lawyers, give this a shot. If you want to see one of the best performances of someone who's head is messed up beyond what you can comprehend, watch this now.",5,"Ed Norton, congratulations",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,1054,"['Wow', 'husband', 'urged', 'watch', 'see', 'Ed', 'Norton', 'beginnings', ""'m"", 'still', 'shock', 'how', 'fantastic', 'portrayed', 'character-', 'kind', 'stuff', 'really', 'should', 'be', 'handing', 'awards', 'out', 'for.This', 'story', 'beautifully', 'written', 'executed', 'right', 'cue', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'knack', 'suave', ""n't"", 'lacking', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'build', 'own', 'cemented', 'character', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Norton', 'character', 'simple', 'slow', 'generally', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'center', 'attention', 'chaos', 'swirls', 'innocent', 'bystander', 'victim', 'life', 'Yes', 'was', 'hurt', 'Yes', 'damaged', 'so', 'gentle.Hold', 'breath', 'end', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'jaw', 'stayed', 'open', 'solid', '60', 'seconds.If', 'are', 'interested', 'psychological', 'traumas', 'messed', 'up', 'priests', 'hardcore', 'lawyers', 'give', 'shot', 'want', 'see', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'someone', 'who', 'head', 'messed', 'up', 'what', 'can', 'comprehend', 'watch', 'now']",N/A
126030,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,0792140346,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","Primal Fear, 1996 film""Every defendant has the right to a good defense."" We see views of Chicago at night. The lawyer Marty Vale attends a dinner party for the Archbishop of Chicago. The lawyer makes a deal for an ""alleged"" bad guy. His client tells about official corruption, an offer to testify against a local politician. Elsewhere a window is broken in a fight. The fugitive is pursued. A 19-year old is arrested for murder. Marty rushes to offer help. [Publicity is a benefit.] The accused tells how he met the archbishop on the street. ""That was nice of him."" Who else was in the room? Aaron Stampler blacked out. Marty begins his defense by investigating the case and his client. The DA wants the death penalty. There is an initial court hearing. The investigator sees Aaron's rented room, and learns more. Alex has a temper. Who is Linda? A doctor interviews Aaron on videotape in jail.The judge allows the gory photographs in as evidence over Marty's objection. The doctor questions Aaron. Marty looks into the archbishop's charities and recognizes a name. The land there belongs to a charity, they want to develop it and throw people out of their homes. Is there a hidden scandal that may come out? The trial begins. Lawyer Vale pushes the idea of a third person who was present. ""B32-156"" is a reference to ""The Scarlet Letter"". Vale and his investigator find a man, he knows about Linda and tells of home movies. Vale finds a video tape and views it. Then he visits Aaron and sees a change in his personality! We learn who did it. The doctor observes this. ""He really did it."" Is it too late for an insanity defense? Vale believes in the goodness of people, but sometimes they do bad things.""What are you going to do, Marty?"" Vale must save Aaron's life. Can they get the tape admitted into the trial? ""Of course!"" The Prosecutor isn't fooled by this. The DA tells her to destroy the tape, as he did. Defender Vale summon DA John Shaughnessy to the witness stand, and ask him about a bankrupt development corporation. Does her recall any allegations against Archbishop Rushman that were covered-up? The judge declares Vale in contempt and fines him $10,000! The doctor testified about a ""multiple personality disorder"". The Prosecutor questions the doctor about whether there is corroboration. Vale questions Aaron about his relationships. ""He did everything for me."" Prosecutor Venable then questions Aaron. Was he forced to do it? Roy reacts to the questions. The judge will dismiss the jury and hold a bench trial. She will not rescind the fine for contempt. Was justice done? Did Vale use Venable? Will there be a happy ending for them?Aaron blacked out, he will be sent to a hospital. ""Tell Miss Venable I'm sorry."" (!) Vale catches him in a lie. Attorney-client privilege: Aaron tells why they can't find Linda. He also tells about Roy. And so it ends. Can an experienced lawyer be fooled by a client? It would not be surprising and dramatic without this ending. [There are some faults. The stabbing frenzy suggests a rejected lover rather than the result of a videotaped encounter. A clever Aaron wouldn't say he was sorry about the Prosecutor. And how did a 19-year old learn so much to fake his character?This is a clever story that touches on subjects but then avoids them. Corruption in Chicago? Confiscating property under eminent domain to sell it to a millionaire developer? A churchman who sexually abuses children? The seeming ethical lapses of a lawyer who defends by all means?",3,Death Comes for the Archbishop,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",2011,3507,"['Primal', 'Fear', '1996', 'film', 'Every', 'defendant', 'right', 'good', 'defense', 'see', 'views', 'Chicago', 'night', 'lawyer', 'Marty', 'Vale', 'dinner', 'party', 'Archbishop', 'Chicago', 'lawyer', 'deal', 'alleged', 'bad', 'guy', 'client', 'tells', 'official', 'corruption', 'offer', 'testify', 'local', 'politician', 'Elsewhere', 'window', 'broken', 'fight', 'fugitive', 'pursued', '19-year', 'old', 'arrested', 'murder', 'Marty', 'rushes', 'offer', 'help', '[', 'Publicity', 'benefit', ']', 'accused', 'how', 'met', 'archbishop', 'street', 'was', 'nice', 'Who', 'else', 'was', 'room', 'Aaron', 'Stampler', 'blacked', 'out', 'Marty', 'defense', 'investigating', 'case', 'client', 'DA', 'death', 'penalty', 'initial', 'court', 'hearing', 'investigator', 'Aaron', 'rented', 'room', 'more', 'Alex', 'temper', 'Who', 'Linda', 'A', 'doctor', 'interviews', 'Aaron', 'videotape', 'jail.The', 'judge', 'gory', 'photographs', 'evidence', 'Marty', 'objection', 'doctor', 'questions', 'Aaron', 'Marty', 'archbishop', 'charities', 'name', 'land', 'there', 'charity', 'want', 'develop', 'throw', 'people', 'homes', 'there', 'hidden', 'scandal', 'may', 'come', 'out', 'trial', 'Lawyer', 'Vale', 'idea', 'third', 'person', 'who', 'was', 'present', 'B32-156', 'reference', 'Scarlet', 'Letter', 'Vale', 'investigator', 'find', 'man', 'Linda', 'tells', 'home', 'movies', 'Vale', 'video', 'tape', 'views', 'Then', 'Aaron', 'change', 'personality', 'learn', 'who', 'did', 'doctor', 'really', 'did', 'too', 'late', 'insanity', 'defense', 'Vale', 'goodness', 'people', 'sometimes', 'do', 'bad', 'things', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'Marty', 'Vale', 'must', 'save', 'Aaron', 'life', 'Can', 'get', 'tape', 'admitted', 'trial', 'course', 'Prosecutor', ""n't"", 'fooled', 'DA', 'destroy', 'tape', 'did', 'Defender', 'Vale', 'summon', 'DA', 'John', 'Shaughnessy', 'witness', 'stand', 'ask', 'bankrupt', 'development', 'corporation', 'recall', 'allegations', 'Archbishop', 'Rushman', 'were', 'covered-up', 'judge', 'Vale', 'contempt', '10,000', 'doctor', 'testified', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'Prosecutor', 'questions', 'doctor', 'corroboration', 'Vale', 'questions', 'Aaron', 'relationships', 'did', 'everything', 'Prosecutor', 'Venable', 'then', 'questions', 'Aaron', 'Was', 'forced', 'do', 'Roy', 'questions', 'judge', 'will', 'dismiss', 'jury', 'hold', 'bench', 'trial', 'will', 'not', 'rescind', 'fine', 'contempt', 'Was', 'justice', 'done', 'Did', 'Vale', 'use', 'Venable', 'Will', 'there', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', 'Aaron', 'blacked', 'out', 'will', 'be', 'sent', 'hospital', 'Tell', 'Miss', 'Venable', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Vale', 'lie', 'Attorney-client', 'privilege', 'Aaron', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'Linda', 'also', 'Roy', 'Can', 'experienced', 'lawyer', 'be', 'fooled', 'client', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'surprising', 'dramatic', 'ending', '[', 'are', 'faults', 'stabbing', 'frenzy', 'rejected', 'lover', 'rather', 'result', 'videotaped', 'encounter', 'clever', 'Aaron', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'sorry', 'Prosecutor', 'how', 'did', '19-year', 'old', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'fake', 'character', 'clever', 'story', 'subjects', 'then', 'Corruption', 'Chicago', 'Confiscating', 'property', 'eminent', 'domain', 'sell', 'millionaire', 'developer', 'churchman', 'who', 'sexually', 'children', 'seeming', 'ethical', 'lapses', 'lawyer', 'who', 'means']",N/A

The standard DVD has been part of our library for many years, and when I saw the Blu Ray version was out and so reasonably priced, I had to make an exception to my ""don't replace"" policy and bought the HD version.Watching it again, I'm struck by just how believable the characters are.  While the movie is technically a murder-mystery, it's really the character study of the lost boy that drives it.  Edward Norton is simply perfect in the role.  You accept the character, feel for him, and are shocked my him, all at the same time.  Richard Gere is fine form, and brings a combination of raw ambition and sincere believability to his role.  The chemistry between the two is hard to match.The Blu Ray is a good upgrade in picture quality.  It's not perfect, but it's an older movie.  The studio avoids doing too much noise reduction, so you do get some film grain.  But I always find that preferable to soft edges and blurred textures.If you have the standard DVD, should you upgrade?  I'm glad I did.

126035,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792140346,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","The worst thing I can say about `Primal Fear' is that it plays out like an extended episode of `Law & Order'; but that being the worst of it is really not so bad.  I actually enjoy a good episode of `Law & Order', and beings that this follows the `SVU' pattern of process (which happens to be my favorite variation of the `Law & Order' franchise) I am really quite impressed with this film.  It isn't perfect, and there are a few plot holes that take away from the films credibility, but it is nothing so immense that it remains unforgivable.  No, `Primal Fear' is actually well crafted and splendidly acted to the point where its faults are easily overlooked.The film tells the story of Aaron Stampler, a troubled young man who was found fleeing the bloody aftermath of the archbishop's murder.  Aaron, who served as an alter boy, claims to have blacked out after seeing another man standing over the archbishop's body.  He doesn't remember a thing aside from the fact that he didn't do it.  Hotshot lawyer Martin Vail takes on Aaron's case free of charge, seeking the attention the high profile murder case will bring to his career.  What Vail gets is not as cut and dry as many felt it would be, and he finds himself stepping further and further down a road complete with numerous twists and turns.I am not a huge fan of Richard Gere, but he is utterly flawless in this film.  His charisma is perfectly suited for this role, and he tones it down enough to give us a glimpse into the inner fears of this man.  Laura Linney, an actress I am eternally smitten, also delivers, but not as strongly as she usually does.  She comes off a tad too rehearsed for me in scenes.  Maybe it's just that she lacks chemistry with Gere, and so he makes her look bad by acting so much better around her.  Frances McDormand doesn't have that problem (is she ever `bad' though) as she bounces off Gere and Norton brilliantly.  Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney are also splendid in their supporting parts, bringing so much swagger and grace to their respective roles.But this movie belongs to one individual; Edward Norton.As Aaron, Norton brilliant shifts from innocent ignorance to brutal defiance.  He manages to make his characters twitches and emotional weight seem natural and most importantly, relevant.  We bleed for him, cry for him, shiver for him and in the end we believe in him.  This may be one of the greatest screen debuts of all time (right up there with Whoopi Goldberg).  Edward Norton has turned into one of our generation's greatest working actors, and this film is where that all began.  Just watch those eyes, manipulating and calculating and pleading all at the same time.  He is everything he needs to be and everything we need him to be, and he accomplishes this effortlessly.In the end I will highly recommend `Primal Fear'.  Yes, it could have tightened things up a little in certain areas, but what it does give us is a very nicely constructed legal thriller that will please any fan of the genre.  If you are a lover of `Law & Order' then this will satisfy your desires; but in the same respect, if you are often turned off by the legal courtroom drama's then this is not the film for you.",4,Nicely constructed thriller that serves up the goods...,1223424000,"10 8, 2008",2008,3199,"['worst', 'thing', 'can', 'say', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'out', 'extended', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'being', 'worst', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'enjoy', 'good', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'beings', 'SVU', 'pattern', 'process', 'be', 'favorite', 'variation', 'Law', 'Order', 'franchise', 'am', 'really', 'quite', 'impressed', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'are', 'few', 'plot', 'holes', 'take', 'away', 'films', 'credibility', 'nothing', 'so', 'immense', 'unforgivable', 'No', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'actually', 'well', 'crafted', 'splendidly', 'acted', 'point', 'where', 'faults', 'are', 'easily', 'overlooked.The', 'film', 'story', 'Aaron', 'Stampler', 'troubled', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'found', 'fleeing', 'bloody', 'aftermath', 'archbishop', 'murder', 'Aaron', 'who', 'served', 'alter', 'boy', 'claims', 'have', 'blacked', 'out', 'seeing', 'man', 'standing', 'archbishop', 'body', ""n't"", 'remember', 'thing', 'aside', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'Hotshot', 'lawyer', 'Martin', 'Vail', 'Aaron', 'case', 'free', 'charge', 'seeking', 'attention', 'high', 'profile', 'murder', 'case', 'will', 'bring', 'career', 'What', 'Vail', 'not', 'cut', 'dry', 'many', 'felt', 'would', 'be', 'stepping', 'further', 'further', 'down', 'road', 'complete', 'numerous', 'twists', 'turns.I', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'utterly', 'flawless', 'film', 'charisma', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'role', 'down', 'enough', 'give', 'glimpse', 'inner', 'fears', 'man', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'actress', 'am', 'eternally', 'smitten', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'strongly', 'usually', 'tad', 'too', 'rehearsed', 'scenes', 'Maybe', 'just', 'chemistry', 'Gere', 'so', 'look', 'bad', 'acting', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'Frances', 'McDormand', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'ever', 'bad', 'though', 'off', 'Gere', 'Norton', 'brilliantly', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'are', 'also', 'splendid', 'supporting', 'parts', 'bringing', 'so', 'much', 'swagger', 'grace', 'respective', 'roles.But', 'movie', 'one', 'individual', 'Edward', 'Norton.As', 'Aaron', 'Norton', 'brilliant', 'shifts', 'innocent', 'ignorance', 'brutal', 'defiance', 'make', 'characters', 'twitches', 'emotional', 'weight', 'seem', 'natural', 'most', 'importantly', 'relevant', 'bleed', 'cry', 'shiver', 'end', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'screen', 'debuts', 'time', 'right', 'there', 'Whoopi', 'Goldberg', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'turned', 'one', 'generation', 'greatest', 'working', 'actors', 'film', 'where', 'began', 'Just', 'watch', 'eyes', 'manipulating', 'calculating', 'pleading', 'same', 'time', 'everything', 'be', 'everything', 'need', 'be', 'end', 'will', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'Yes', 'could', 'have', 'tightened', 'things', 'up', 'little', 'certain', 'areas', 'what', 'give', 'very', 'nicely', 'constructed', 'legal', 'thriller', 'will', 'please', 'fan', 'genre', 'are', 'lover', 'Law', 'Order', 'then', 'will', 'satisfy', 'desires', 'same', 'respect', 'are', 'often', 'turned', 'off', 'legal', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'then', 'not', 'film']",N/A

126038,A1PASRZ81DY9C,0792140346,Austin Somlo,"[2, 12]","Viewed: 5/05Rate: 35/05: Primal Fear is simply not believable. It spins a yarn with many weak threads, finally arriving at a lame The Usual Suspects ending. A few of these threads moreover lead to dead ends. Take for Pinero's Hispanic friend who agreed to testify in court. Never saw him again. Take Pinero's role in this film. What was it so important about him? To introduce the subplot of investment deal? Didn't do much for the story. A scene between Gere and Linney in a bar after the drop off of a videotape in front of Linney's doorstep reached a dead end and wasted some screen time. I am so intrigued about one thing. Although Roy/Aaron personality exists, what happened to the verification of the MRI/EKG/CAT scans? Wow, I could go on with many blunders of Primal Fear. Logically, the picture splits apart like a bad melon. The casting of a few players was poor. John Mahoney doesn't work as Shaughnessy. Andre Baugher, how horrible was he, played the black assistant of Martin Vail (Gere), and that was the worst acting I've seen in this silly film. Come on, Don Cheadle or Adrian Lester can do better than him for the role. Edward Norton is a joke. In a conclusion, Primal Fear is an awful picture with very superficial acting, many holes, endless logic faults, and a silly story that begs too hard to work. It is a rip-off from A Few Good Men, The Usual Suspects, and Law And Order shows. Nobody in the film looks like a lawyer, a cop, a judge, a reporter, a criminal, or anything else imaginable.

So it puts me only slightly ahead of the attorney in the case. But he figured out the next to last surprise before I did . . . or about the same time.It's that kind of a suspense film.Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) is arrested for the really gory, disgusting mutilation murder of Bishop Richard Rushman. Marty Vale (Richard Gere) volunteers to defend him pro bono. Assistant DA Janet Venable (Laura Linney) is assigned the prosecution. The twist is that she had an affair with Vale back when he was working for the DA, before he went out on his own as a defense attorney.Aaron insists he did not do it, despite some pretty terrible evidence against him. Vale originally tells him it doesn't matter, that his job is to defend him anyway, but gradually becomes convinced that Aaron really is innocent as he discovers some pretty strange connections between the Bishop and various other interests who might have wanted to kill him, and some other . . . see, I'm trying not to spoil it for you. OK; Aaron was an alter boy and a choir boy, even though he was 19. He lived in a group home run by the church for homeless kids, even though the cut-off age for residency was 18. The Bishop arranged for him to stay.When Vale's investigator goes to Aaron's room at the shelter to search for any useful evidence, he is attacked by one of the other choir boys, and in the process rips off the boy's earring. Yes, Aaron can identify it, and won't say that the boy with the earring was completely incapable of murdering the Bishop.Told you too much already. Watch the strangeness unfold on its own.

He is charged with the vicious murder of his mentor and bishop.  He as a wonder at portraying a boy with a split personality.  Or did he?  How could he so young when Richard Gere, playing his defense attory, was in his prime.  Gere's white hair was shiny and beautiful.  I do like white-haired men.  Women just look old with white hair, while men look 'dignified.'This was five years before Edward Norton starred in ""The Score,"" with Marlon Brandon, which was filmed five years before he really was a star in ""The Illusionist.""  He's turned into a marvelous actor.How sad that many people see their time on earth as either an hourly wage or doing something unpleasant.  No good thing done for God will go unrewarded.  The bishop, however, was not a lily-white man of God and he used and abused Linda and Aaron who trusted him and made a video of what he had them doing.  Other altar boys at the church had disappeared.  This bishop was a deviant and the tape proved it.  The murderer named Roy gave him 78 stab sounds, some on the gentials.  See this film to know why.Sometimes regular people do very bad things.  He was guilty only of dishonoring the Bishop's memory.  Aaron had called him ""a wonderful man"" who had forced them perform like circus animals for his own pleasure.  Roy admitted after the woman judge threw the case out of court that there never had been an Aaron (the goody boy) but the client-attorney privilege kept his lawyer who had taken the case just for the media attention it would draw, was his key to freedom.

In other words, this movie made him a star, as the clich&eacute; goes.But Richard Gere should be credited, too, with another fine acting performance. For quite awhile there, Gere acted in one good movie after another and I believe this was one of his best efforts. Sometimes his ""pretty boy"" image masked the fact that he has been a pretty darned good actor in a number of film.Not only is the acting superb in here - by everyone - but the story is very involving, too. I remember being riveted to the screen while seeing this in the theater. Some of the scenes are quite shocking, particularly when we discover the real ""Aaron Stampler"" (Norton). If you wait awhile (at least five years) and see it again, it's still shocking even if you vaguely remember a few things.The bad side of this - to me, not to most people, is the overuse of the Lord's name in vain in here (mostly by Gere, who is ridiculous in this role in that regard) and the obvious anti-Roman Catholic bias in here (and I'm not Catholic).  I also didn't find Laura Linney's character, ""Janet Venable"" to be entertaining, just annoying. There's something about Linney's smug looks that really turn me off.Overall, if language or Catholic-bashing doesn't bother you, this is a super film.

What was originally marketed as a vehicle for Richard Gere became a breakout role for then-up-and-coming Edward Norton, who would go on to earn an Academy Award nomination for his performance and all kinds of critical praise.There is an audio commentary by director Gregory Hoblit, writer Ann Biderman, producer Gary Lucchesi, executive producer Hawk Koch, and casting director Deborah Aquila. Hoblit says that there was surprisingly little studio interference and that he hasn't enjoyed that kind of freedom since. Everyone talks about how the studio didn't want Laura Linney or Edward Norton cast because they were unknowns at the time and it wanted proven movie stars in those roles. They had seen over 2,000 actors for Norton's role and the studio wanted Leonardo DiCaprio but he passed.

Havethere ever been two more annoying people in the world? And the factthat they feed off each other's annoying behaviour is all theworse. If E were to do a serious pre-awards show, they might have twopeople out there greeting stars who actually know something aboutthem. I witnessed Joan Rivers talking to the multitalented but muchunderrated Laura Linney. Rivers asked Linney how she would follow upher critically acclaimed performance in You Can Count on Me, andLinney replied that she would be working on a project with RichardGere. Rivers asked if that would be intimidating to work with someoneas famous and well known as Gere. Any entertainment reporter worth adamn would know that Linney held her own quite well opposite RichardGere in this film, Primal Fear. Linney was gracious of course andinformed Rivers that she is lucky because she has worked with Gerebefore. I just recently saw Primal Fear. I had always wanted to see itbecause I have seen all of Edward Norton's subsequent performances.Knowing that his powerful performance in Primal Fear more or lesslaunched his highly diverse and successful career made me curious, butI never quite got around to it. But finally I did. And a stunningperformance Norton offered indeed. His dual personalities (which turnout to be a deception on his part) are skillfully executed, and hemanages to dupe everyone. Richard Gere is the perfect person for therole of an arrogant, high powered attorney who thinks he can defendthe lowest of the low and get them off the hook. He plays this sort ofrole best. Linney is the prosecutor who has shared what she calls asix month long one night stand with Gere's character. She is alsoassigned to prosecute the case against Norton's character while Geretakes on Norton's character's case.  Excellent in small but importantroles are Frances McDormand as a psychiatrist and John Mahoney as theattorney general, Shaugnessy. (It was sort of strange to see him playa semi-bad guy.

Gere is the slick, bigshot lawyer who cares little for the truth.  To him the end, which is winning his case, justifies the means.  No one in the movie is a decent human being.  The Catholic bishop who is murdered brutally near the start of the movie is a sexual pervert, presumably murdered by the overgrown altar boy (19 years old) caught fleeing the bloody scene.  Gere's legal opponent is the DA Laura Linney, Gere's ex-girlfriend.  She is clever too, but not quite as clever as Gere.  The ending shows the triumph of evil in a dysfunctional world.

Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Alfre Woodard, Frances McDormand, Steven Bauer, John Mahoney and Andre Braugher all put in fine performances. The film has good moments of suspense and drama, and Gregory Hoblit directs the film with a modicum of passion and intensity. When all is said and done, this is a pretty unremarkable film......and then you have Edward Norton.Edward Norton's ingenious performance is what elevates this film above and beyond a great many other legal thrillers. This being the first of many great performances to come from Norton, he brings a lovability, gullibility, quiet menace and unbridled fury to a role that could have easily been portrayed in a very TV-movie kind of way by a lesser performer. When he's on screen, the quality of the performers around him turns the dial up to eleven. He gives the role of Aaron Stampler a life of its own, and he's really the only actor in the film that you can sense isn't just pantomiming a character stereotype. Gere is the flashy, selfish, self-absorbed defense attorney; Linney is the cold-as-ice, tough-as-nails prosecutor; McDormand is the intelligent, maternal psychologist; Woodard is a tough-but-fair judge; Bauer plays essentially the same role he played in SCARFACE... anyway, you get the idea.It's essentially a film that, if it had lacked Norton, would be maybe a 2-star movie at best, even with the shock ending. But because Norton is such a naturally gifted performer and the way that he sells the character and the shock ending is what elevates this film to a highly recommended 4-star film.Also, bear in mind, Cuba Gooding Jr. for JERRY MAGUIRE beat Norton for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1996. What is Cuba Gooding Jr. doing now? After a string of embarassingly awful features, he's done nothing but Direct-to-DVD films and bad television shows. Norton... he's committed some of the most amazing performances to film since then and is still not recognized by the Academy.Just another example of how frighteningly wrong the Academy can be.",4,Edward Norton is genius.

Years later when the boy has grown to adulthood and can retaliate against the abuser, the black fury of the past results in a gruesome, violent murder. Thus the premise of Primal Fear is realized in the film of the same name. Richard Gere plays Martin Vail an attorney with superb legal abilities and an inflated ego. However, the motivating power of the movie emanates primarily from the demon plagued Aaron Stampler, superbly played by new comer Edward Norton. The heinous murder of an archbishop sets the stage for a media swamped sensational trial in which the prosecutor seeks the death penalty and the defense tries to explain how two distinct personalities exist within the torturous soul of the young man accused of the crime. Still, a very subtle and unsuspecting nuance snakes itself into the story line, like a threatening viper and if not detected will strike your soul as does the film's conclusion.

I am not a fan of Richard Gere, but he does provide a good performance.  This movie is R rated, with quite a bit of cursing that may be offensive to the unaware viewer.The transfer to DVD is exceptional with great picture quality and a 5.1 track.  There is limited surround sound, but the sound is excellent and there is good low bass at the right moments.This is a good bargain bin purchase, and will warrant another viewing in a few years.",5,Be a man.

126092,A2TUXE0L7RP2AH,0792140346,J. Marus,"[0, 0]","Primal Fear is my most favorite thriller of all time and we have two wonderfully talented performers, Richard Gere and Edward Norton to thank for that. They really brought these characters to life big time on the screen. Originally they wanted Leonardo DiCaprio for the role of Aaron/Roy Stampler but apparently DiCaprio turned it down and Edward Norton took over the role and I must say he was the best!!! No other actor could have played that role to powerful perfection the way Norton did. Same goes for Richard Gere as big time defense attorney Martin Vail. He was the best for that role too. You could see the chemistry right there between Gere and Norton in that movie. They certainly were ""A Great Team"" as Roy puts it at the end of the movie. It certainly was him, boy! It certainly was him!!! And that is the first biggest twist of the movie, when we are lead to believe that Aaron has multiple personality disorder and has the Roy side to him that comes to his rescue whenever Aaron feels threatened. The biggest twist shocker is at the end when we find out that there never was an Aaron side to this criminal and that the Roy side of him existed all along and he faked the multiple personality disorder syndrome to get away with the crime by being declared insane. This was an absolute 10 star well done shocker! I own the movie after seeing it back in 1996 and have enjoyed watching it all these years and still look forward to watching it many more years to come. I hope Edward Norton will do another surprising psycho role like his Aaron Stampler character in the future. His stuttering and acting was indeed priceless and au natural in this flick.

126094,A2TDK8D4HEMUYW,0792140346,"John ""MovieAddict""","[4, 4]","With each and every passing of a week it becomes evidently clearer that Hollywood's fixation on making the almighty dollar is much more important than creating quality material. Alas, when the great films do eventually come our way, they seem like masterpieces. Hence this entire ""Lord of the Rings"" craze.""Primal Fear"" is a quiet masterpiece. It's an Oscar contender at heart, hidden beneath a layer of assorted cliches and plot twists. Does that mean the movie is bad? Not by a long shot. It's terribly entertaining and splendidly acted, particularly by a young Edward Norton. It's a fine movie in almost every respect, although it has a few minor flaws that prevent it from becoming completely excellent.In a nutshell: Norton is the 19-year-old who kills the archbishop of a church in Chicago; Gere is his attorney who takes on the case.Gere doesn't care whether his clients are guilty or not. ""I just do my job. It's not like I'm friends with them,"" he says. But he connects with his newest client in a way unlike he ever has before. ""I think he's innocent,"" he tells one of his co-workers. ""I think he's telling the truth.""The stuttering 19-year-old Kentucky boy has no clear motive for killing the archbishop. They are related only through the fact that he was a choirboy for the church and the archbishop had taken him in off the streets. But the clues start to connect and soon they find out that sweet ol' choirboy may have split personality disorder--his other side, Roy, comes into play when his normal side becomes hassed and hurt. The stutters fade away and an evil side shines through--an evil side that admits to killing the archbishop.Of course, we all know that it doesn't stop there. Movies like these never stop once they start going; it's like when you flatten a poster and it keeps rolling back up. Only in this case, everything's unrolling itself until we finally get to see the full picture on the front of the poster. Sometimes it's different than we think it'll be. Sometimes it's exactly what we knew it looked like.The latter is the case with ""Primal Fear."" I guessed every twist early on, and who didn't see the ending coming? But this is simply one of the best Hollywood thrillers in years. When the twists finally reveal themselves, the impact is still as startling as if you were totally blown away and unsuspecting of any more surprises.The cast is certainly top-notch. Along with Gere and the then-unknown Norton, there is Frances McDormand, Laura Linney, John Mahoney and Steven Bauer (Tony's pal from DePalma's ""Scarface,"" in case you're wondering).Richard Gere is undeniably good at playing lawyers. He played one in ""Chicago"" last year, and he also plays one in ""Primal Fear"" (which takes place in Chicago). The reason, I think, is because he's sleazy--or at least good at playing sleazy. He was sleazy in ""Pretty Woman"" and pretty close to a lawyer there. ""Primal Fear"" is one of his greatest roles--but he's really not the reason it works.Edward Norton makes this film work. It takes a great kind of character actor to be able to play such versatile roles, like the stuttering farmboy in ""Primal Fear"" and the mentally-challenged-conman-who-isn't-really-mentally-challenged in ""The Score"" (another terrific film). In the same vein of ""Fight Club,"" this is a film about identities and coming to terms with the fact that you aren't who you think you are--which is, in a way, one of Hollywood's most overused ideas as of recent years. (""Total Recall,"" ""Identity,"" ""Impostor,"" ""Fight Club,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""The Thirteenth Floor,"" etc.)But this is one of the best examples of the formula done justice.",4,Very good thriller with some nice--if predictable--twists...,1075680000,"02 2, 2004",2004,3634,"['passing', 'week', 'evidently', 'clearer', 'Hollywood', 'fixation', 'making', 'almighty', 'dollar', 'much', 'more', 'important', 'creating', 'quality', 'material', 'Alas', 'when', 'great', 'films', 'do', 'eventually', 'come', 'way', 'seem', 'masterpieces', 'Hence', 'entire', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'craze', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'quiet', 'masterpiece', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'heart', 'hidden', 'beneath', 'layer', 'assorted', 'cliches', 'plot', 'twists', 'mean', 'movie', 'bad', 'Not', 'long', 'shot', 'terribly', 'entertaining', 'splendidly', 'acted', 'particularly', 'young', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'fine', 'movie', 'almost', 'respect', 'few', 'minor', 'flaws', 'prevent', 'becoming', 'completely', 'excellent.In', 'nutshell', 'Norton', '19-year-old', 'who', 'archbishop', 'church', 'Chicago', 'Gere', 'attorney', 'who', 'case.Gere', ""n't"", 'care', 'clients', 'are', 'guilty', 'not', 'just', 'do', 'job', 'not', ""'m"", 'friends', 'newest', 'client', 'way', 'ever', 'before', 'think', 'innocent', 'one', 'co-workers', 'think', 'telling', 'truth', 'stuttering', '19-year-old', 'Kentucky', 'boy', 'clear', 'motive', 'killing', 'archbishop', 'are', 'related', 'only', 'fact', 'was', 'choirboy', 'church', 'archbishop', 'had', 'taken', 'off', 'streets', 'clues', 'start', 'connect', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'sweet', 'ol', 'choirboy', 'may', 'have', 'split', 'personality', 'disorder', 'other', 'side', 'Roy', 'play', 'when', 'normal', 'side', 'becomes', 'hassed', 'hurt', 'stutters', 'fade', 'away', 'evil', 'side', 'shines', 'evil', 'side', 'killing', 'archbishop.Of', 'course', 'know', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there', 'Movies', 'never', 'stop', 'once', 'start', 'going', 'when', 'flatten', 'poster', 'rolling', 'back', 'up', 'Only', 'case', 'everything', 'unrolling', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'full', 'picture', 'front', 'poster', 'different', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'Sometimes', 'exactly', 'what', 'knew', 'looked', 'like.The', 'latter', 'case', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'guessed', 'twist', 'early', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ending', 'coming', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'Hollywood', 'thrillers', 'years', 'When', 'twists', 'finally', 'reveal', 'impact', 'still', 'as', 'startling', 'were', 'totally', 'blown', 'away', 'unsuspecting', 'more', 'surprises.The', 'cast', 'certainly', 'top-notch', 'Gere', 'then-unknown', 'Norton', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'John', 'Mahoney', 'Steven', 'Bauer', 'Tony', 'pal', 'DePalma', 'Scarface', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', '.Richard', 'Gere', 'undeniably', 'good', 'playing', 'lawyers', 'played', 'one', 'Chicago', 'last', 'year', 'also', 'one', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'place', 'Chicago', 'reason', 'think', 'sleazy', 'least', 'good', 'playing', 'sleazy', 'was', 'sleazy', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'pretty', 'close', 'lawyer', 'there', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'one', 'greatest', 'roles', 'really', 'not', 'reason', 'Norton', 'film', 'work', 'great', 'kind', 'character', 'actor', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'such', 'versatile', 'roles', 'stuttering', 'farmboy', 'Primal', 'Fear', ""mentally-challenged-conman-who-isn't-really-mentally-challenged"", 'Score', 'terrific', 'film', 'same', 'vein', 'Fight', 'Club', 'film', 'identities', 'coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'are', ""n't"", 'who', 'think', 'are', 'way', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'overused', 'ideas', 'recent', 'years', 'Total', 'Recall', 'Identity', 'Impostor', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Matrix', 'Thirteenth', 'Floor', 'etc', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'formula', 'done', 'justice']",N/A

Many of the recent string of successful courtroom dramas have been adaptations of novelist John Grisham's masterful literary works, such as; ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Client"", ""The Firm"", and most recently ""The Runaway Jury"", however other courtroom dramas have appeared on the scene that haven't been created by Grisham's books ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Rules of Engagement"" are two excellent examples that come to mind.  Another wonderful example of cinematic brilliance would be the 1996 legal thriller starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and newcomer Edward Norton, ""Primal Fear"".""Primal Fear"" focuses on high-powered Chicago attorney, Martin Vail (Richard Gere), who happens to be one of the city's best defense attorneys, and also one of the most despised.  After settling a fairly big case, Vail searching for his next gold mine of a case, catches wind of a recent murder of an Archbishop of the Catholic Church in Chicago.  With an altar boy (Edward Norton) as the only suspect of this high profile, mega media attention grabbing case, Vail is quick to offer his services to the young boy in hopes of cashing in on the spotlight this case grants him.  However, what seemed to be a rather cut-and-dry case has revealed itself to be a vast web of betrayal, corruption, and wickedness that has ties all the way from the bottom-feeders of the city to the upper echelon of the rich and powerful.  To make matters worse the prosecutor for the case just so happens to be a scorned lover of Vail's (Laura Linney), who is every bit his equal in the court, and to win the case, Vail will have to summon all his expertise and even then it may not be enough.Director Gregory Hoblit has carefully and skillfully crafted a magnificent legal thriller with enough twists and turns to leave you guessing who the real victim is in the entire ordeal.  Most legal thrillers are engaging enough based on the trial that serves as the focal point for the film, however this movie chose to provide a very interesting and engaging trial along with a side story in the character of Martin Vail and his journey from glory hound lawyer to someone trying to save a life of a client he truly believes to be innocent for a change.  The entire cast is rock solid, especially Richard Gere and Edward Norton, Gere, who to me has seemed a little too prissy in recent roles (""Pretty Woman"" and ""Runaway Bride""), does an excellent job of portraying the despicable nature of this slimy lawyer, Martin Vail.  Edward Norton is equally powerful and mesmerizing in his portrayal of the altar boy/murder suspect, who is more than he appears to be at first glance, his acting is truly impressive for a newcomer.  The supporting cast is just as strong as the two leads; Laura Linney being strongest of the supporting characters, and her interactions with Gere are truly fun to watch.All in all I can't really think of anything about ""Primal Fear"" that is negative, except for it would have been nicer for the subplot involving Martin's previous case to have been detailed a little more, but that's essentially immaterial as what was given via exposition was enough to make sense of the situation.  Really all I can say is that if you are a fan of legal thrillers then this is definitely one you should not miss, and when you watch it you must pay attention at all times because almost every scene contains some element that is integral to the overall story that is unfolding.""Primal Fear"" is rated R for violence, language, and brief nudity/sexuality.",5,Face Your Fear...,1144281600,"04 6, 2006",2006,3635,"['Courtroom', 'generally', 'translate', 'big', 'box', 'office', 'numbers', 'respective', 'studios', 'other', 'parties', 'involved', 'Many', 'recent', 'string', 'successful', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'have', 'been', 'adaptations', 'novelist', 'John', 'Grisham', 'masterful', 'literary', 'works', 'such', 'Time', 'Kill', 'Client', 'Firm', 'most', 'recently', 'Runaway', 'Jury', 'however', 'other', 'courtroom', 'dramas', 'have', 'appeared', 'scene', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'created', 'Grisham', 'books', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'Rules', 'Engagement', 'are', 'two', 'excellent', 'examples', 'come', 'mind', 'wonderful', 'example', 'cinematic', 'brilliance', 'would', 'be', '1996', 'legal', 'thriller', 'starring', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'newcomer', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'focuses', 'high-powered', 'Chicago', 'attorney', 'Martin', 'Vail', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'who', 'be', 'one', 'city', 'best', 'defense', 'attorneys', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'despised', 'settling', 'fairly', 'big', 'case', 'Vail', 'searching', 'next', 'gold', 'mine', 'case', 'catches', 'wind', 'recent', 'murder', 'Archbishop', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'Chicago', 'altar', 'boy', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'only', 'suspect', 'high', 'profile', 'mega', 'media', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'case', 'Vail', 'quick', 'offer', 'services', 'young', 'boy', 'hopes', 'cashing', 'spotlight', 'case', 'However', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'rather', 'cut-and-dry', 'case', 'revealed', 'be', 'vast', 'web', 'betrayal', 'corruption', 'wickedness', 'ties', 'way', 'bottom-feeders', 'city', 'upper', 'echelon', 'rich', 'powerful', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'prosecutor', 'case', 'just', 'so', 'be', 'scorned', 'lover', 'Vail', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'bit', 'equal', 'court', 'win', 'case', 'Vail', 'will', 'have', 'summon', 'expertise', 'even', 'then', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough.Director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'carefully', 'skillfully', 'crafted', 'magnificent', 'legal', 'thriller', 'enough', 'twists', 'leave', 'guessing', 'who', 'real', 'victim', 'entire', 'ordeal', 'Most', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'are', 'engaging', 'enough', 'based', 'trial', 'focal', 'point', 'film', 'however', 'movie', 'chose', 'provide', 'very', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'trial', 'side', 'story', 'character', 'Martin', 'Vail', 'journey', 'glory', 'hound', 'lawyer', 'someone', 'trying', 'save', 'life', 'client', 'be', 'innocent', 'change', 'entire', 'cast', 'rock', 'solid', 'especially', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'Gere', 'who', 'seemed', 'little', 'too', 'prissy', 'recent', 'roles', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'Runaway', 'Bride', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'despicable', 'nature', 'slimy', 'lawyer', 'Martin', 'Vail', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'equally', 'powerful', 'mesmerizing', 'portrayal', 'altar', 'boy/murder', 'suspect', 'who', 'more', 'be', 'first', 'glance', 'acting', 'truly', 'impressive', 'newcomer', 'supporting', 'cast', 'just', 'as', 'strong', 'two', 'leads', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'being', 'strongest', 'supporting', 'characters', 'interactions', 'Gere', 'are', 'truly', 'fun', 'watch.All', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'anything', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'negative', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nicer', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Martin', 'previous', 'case', 'have', 'been', 'detailed', 'little', 'more', 'essentially', 'immaterial', 'what', 'was', 'given', 'exposition', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'sense', 'situation', 'Really', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'fan', 'legal', 'thrillers', 'then', 'definitely', 'one', 'should', 'not', 'miss', 'when', 'watch', 'must', 'pay', 'attention', 'times', 'almost', 'scene', 'element', 'integral', 'overall', 'story', 'unfolding', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'brief', 'nudity/sexuality']",N/A

It looks like an open and shut case against the simple, stuttering boy, until dashing Martin Vail (Richard Gere), a self-proclaimed ""big-deal lawyer,"" offers to defend him - pro bono.  The prosecutor he'll be facing in the courtroom is none other than his ex-girlfriend (Laura Linney), who is still bitter about their past.  With the help of a psychologist (Frances McDormand), Vail discovers a shocking secret about young Aaron that may save his life.This is a great movie; I've seen it many times and it never gets old.  Gere is perfectly cast as the handsome and confident charmer, and Edward Norton surely had one of his best roles ever as Aaron - and this was his first movie role.

Aside from a great story-line and exceptional performances, however, is the portrayal of the legal system. Most ""law"" movies ignore the fundamentals of criminal procedure and the rules of evidence.  For example, in ""A Few Good Men,"" the witnesses do very little testifying; instead the attorney testifies (that Santiago, the vic, didn't pack anything or call anyone to tell them he was being transferred...etc.) - the rules of evidence forbid such testimony by the attorney. Even so, ""A Few Good Men"" is a hollywood blockbuster and is, admittedly, an interesting movie. However, ""Primal Fear"" portrayed more accurate court scenes and was still a box-office success (and in my opinion, a better movie for it). Hopefully, other directors and screen-writers will be encouraged by this & fewer will completely ignore the law when creating characters that are facing trial; the court room needn't be just another set...it can be a focal component of a great film (as this movie indicates).",5,Provides a more accurate look at the legal system...,1166486400,"12 19, 2006",2006,1166,"['Edward', 'Norton', 'portrayal', 'butcher', 'boy', 'altar', 'boy', 'accused', 'brutally', 'murdering', 'bishop', 'acting', 'best', 'earning', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'successful', 'career', 'Aside', 'great', 'story-line', 'exceptional', 'performances', 'however', 'portrayal', 'legal', 'system', 'Most', 'law', 'movies', 'ignore', 'fundamentals', 'criminal', 'procedure', 'rules', 'evidence', 'example', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'witnesses', 'do', 'very', 'little', 'testifying', 'instead', 'attorney', 'testifies', 'Santiago', 'vic', 'did', ""n't"", 'pack', 'anything', 'call', 'anyone', 'tell', 'was', 'being', 'transferred', 'etc', 'rules', 'evidence', 'forbid', 'such', 'testimony', 'attorney', 'Even', 'so', 'A', 'Few', 'Good', 'Men', 'hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'admittedly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'However', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'portrayed', 'more', 'accurate', 'court', 'scenes', 'was', 'still', 'box-office', 'success', 'opinion', 'better', 'movie', 'Hopefully', 'other', 'directors', 'screen-writers', 'will', 'be', 'encouraged', 'fewer', 'will', 'completely', 'ignore', 'law', 'when', 'creating', 'characters', 'are', 'facing', 'trial', 'court', 'room', 'need', ""n't"", 'be', 'just', 'set', 'can', 'be', 'focal', 'component', 'great', 'film', 'movie']",N/A

126114,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,0792140346,Michael Butts,"[4, 4]","First off, ""Primal Fear"" is an excellent movie, and shows why Richard Gere is such an underrated actor.  His performance as Marty Vail is right on target, and is probably the best work he has done in films.  Laura Linney, Andre Braugher and Frances McDormand were top notch as well.  Even Alfre Woodard's minor role as the judge was brilliant.  And of course, we can't overlook the Oscar-nominated performance of Edward Norton.  I don't remember who won, but Norton should have.  It's an understated, complex performance.  Notice his eyes when he's the soft and gentle Aaron; then notice them again when Roy emerges.  What a stunning turnabout!Now, if you've read William Diehl's book upon which this movie is based, you have the distinct benefit of understanding a lot more about Stampler's background and driving forces.  Unfortunately, the movie could not provide a real motivation for Stampler's murder of the archbishop.  If the movie has shortcoming, it's that it never really explains why Aaron killed him.  And the book has a lot more involving the alternate Roy that also helps deepen the complexity of Aaron/Roy.  The chilling ending, however, in both the book and the movie, still packs a tremendous wallop.  If you liked this movie, read the entire Marty Vail series by Diehl; if you think Aaron was bad in this one, wait till you see what he does in the future!Oh, by the way, Gere and Linney's relationship was one of the most honest I've seen in some while; wish we could have seen more of why they really had ""split,"" so to speak.A great movie, though.",5,GEREAT MOVIE!,1012953600,"02 6, 2002",2002,1568,"['First', 'off', 'Primal', 'Fear', 'excellent', 'movie', 'why', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'such', 'underrated', 'actor', 'performance', 'Marty', 'Vail', 'right', 'target', 'probably', 'best', 'work', 'done', 'films', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Andre', 'Braugher', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'were', 'top', 'notch', 'as', 'well', 'Even', 'Alfre', 'Woodard', 'minor', 'role', 'judge', 'was', 'brilliant', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'who', 'won', 'Norton', 'should', 'have', 'understated', 'complex', 'performance', 'Notice', 'eyes', 'when', 'soft', 'gentle', 'Aaron', 'then', 'again', 'when', 'Roy', 'What', 'stunning', 'turnabout', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'read', 'William', 'Diehl', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'have', 'distinct', 'benefit', 'understanding', 'lot', 'more', 'Stampler', 'background', 'driving', 'forces', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'could', 'not', 'provide', 'real', 'motivation', 'Stampler', 'murder', 'archbishop', 'movie', 'shortcoming', 'never', 'really', 'why', 'Aaron', 'killed', 'book', 'lot', 'more', 'involving', 'alternate', 'Roy', 'also', 'deepen', 'complexity', 'Aaron/Roy', 'chilling', 'ending', 'however', 'book', 'movie', 'still', 'tremendous', 'wallop', 'liked', 'movie', 'read', 'entire', 'Marty', 'Vail', 'series', 'Diehl', 'think', 'Aaron', 'was', 'bad', 'one', 'wait', 'till', 'see', 'what', 'future', 'Oh', 'way', 'Gere', 'Linney', 'relationship', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'why', 'really', 'had', 'split', 'so', 'speak.A', 'great', 'movie', 'though']",N/A

Media hungry lawyer Martin Vale (Richard Gere) sees it as the perfect opportunity to gain exposure and help his career. But as the events of the case unfold, he begins to care more about his client and proving his innocence. Martin is set to face off against the assistant D.A. ( Laura Linney), who is also an ex lover of his. With tension mounting on all sides, it is up to Martin to put his career aside, and find the truth.Primal Fear is one of the best courtroom dramas that you will ever see. The story unfolds brilliantly. You are never quite sure if Aaron is guilty or innocent, and you will be guessing for the whole movie. The ending is my favorite aspect of the movie because of how shocking it was. It is definately not your typical Hollywood ending.The acting is wonderful all the way around. Edward Norton's portrayal of Aaron Stampler is amazing. It takes talent to be able to play both roles so convincingly. One is the sweet and innocent altar boy that is innocent of the crime. The other is the split personality induced madman named Roy. Norton turns both roles on at the drop of a hat, and it is really fun to see. Richard Gere was the perfect choice for Martin Vale. You see two sides to the character as the film unfolds. One is the cocky and selfish lawyer who only cares about his career. The other is the man who comes to care about Aaron. Gere does a great job on both ends. Laura Linney is explosive. Her scenes as the prosecutor are filled with passion and energy. There is also great chemistry between her and Gere because they are ex lovers. I love that aspect of the film, because the case becomes more personal to both of them. Whether Aaron is really guilty or innocent becomes almost secondary to them, because they seem to be more concerned with beating each other. Frances McDormand is also outstanding as Aaron's psychologist Dr. Molly Arrington.I have seen many courtroom dramas, but &quot;Primal Fear&quot; is definately one of the best.

126117,A2ZVERVFM25MJT,0792140346,"Mr. B. G. Fowler ""ben1283""","[3, 3]","Retrospectively the most interesting thing about Primal Fear is that it saw the first movie of actor of a generation Edward Norton.  However, this is a movie that would be worth seeing anyway.  The plot has Gere as a hotshot attorney who defends 19 year-old Aaron (Norton) after he is captured running away from the murder scene of the a bishop who he claims to have been like a father to him.  Seeming like an impossible case to win, Gere originally revels only in the prestige something so high-profile offers him, until Aaron is diagnosed with having multiple personality dissorder.The cast is definitely the best thing about this movie though.  Gere is competent though not an obvious choice as the lawyer, yet the succession of breakthrough roles is very impressive indeed.  Norton is probably one of the most versatile and compelling actors I have ever seen on screen although strangely enough is only just starting to be recognised as such, mostly choosing if not indie movies then certainly ones that are often outside of the glare of Hollywood (excepting the recent Red Dragon).  Anyone who has seen Fight Club, Rounder or in particular the astounding, electric performance he puts in for American History X, can testify to this.  Primal Fear is no exception, and his performance here is probably second only to his in American History X.  There's also an appearance from Frances McDormand before fame hit, as well as Maura Tierny (ER's Abby, who is surely just waiting for her big break anytime soon), both in medium roles.  In addition, Laura Linney proves that she has more than it takes to become a leading lady in a largely unrewarding role.There are a few things wrong with Primal Fear, namely the rather explicit discussions about the nature of right and wrong, which are surely obvious anyway in most lawroom thrillers.  However, it seems unfair to quibble over something that's clearly a very entertaining picture.  The only other real shame is that the movie has been made famous for its twist ending as well as for it's cast, and once you know it's coming it's all too obvious.

126144,A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL,0792140346,Themis-Athena,"[18, 20]","""Fui bailar no meu batel alem do mar cruel,"" sings modern fadista Dulce Pontes in this movie's dynamic title song:  ""I went dancing in my boat, there on the cruel sea."" And it must be just like a nutshell-sized boat dancing on a stormy ocean's  waves that nineteen-year-old Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) feels after his arrest for the savage murder of Chicago's saintly Archbishop Rushman. Or does it?Certainly it doesn't help that Aaron was caught running from the crime scene, covered in blood, and with the archbishop's ring in his pocket.  Besides, who is going to believe him anyway - a stuttering, uneducated boy from rural Kentucky who was found begging by the powerful clergyman, taken in as an altar boy and made to sing in his choir - that he was present when the murder was committed but can't remember a single thing because he blacked out?  Nobody; surely not the police and ADA Janet Venable (Laura Linney), assigned by D.A./Rushman friend Shaughnessy (John Mahoney) personally to try the case, with the express mandate to obtain a death penalty conviction.  Nobody, that is, except Aaron's defense attorney Martin Vail (Richard Gere).  Vail, of all people: the flamboyant ADA-turned-private-practitioner, the star attorney not shying away from even the shadiest client, to whom TV and magazine cover interviews are as second nature as his courtroom appearances, and who cynically quotes as his mottos a professor's maxims on his first day in law school:  ""From this day forward, if your mother says she loves you, get a second opinion."" And: ""If you want justice, go to a whorehouse.  If you want to get f**ked, go to court.""""Primal Fear"" was adapted from William Diehl's like-named bestselling novel and, like in many literary adaptations, its screenplay is a hit-and-miss affair.  Not successful, in my view, are those alterations that unnecessarily make Vail an even more ethically questionable lawyer as already conceived by Diehl; such as the way he becomes Stampler's attorney in the first place (which in the movie amounts to blatant client solicitation; not to mention that no sane lawyer would introduce himself to a potential client with the words ""I'm what you call a 'big shot' attorney""), and the circumstances surrounding the discovery of a tape revealing the archbishop's not-so-nice private side (which in the novel isn't found by Vail but by his investigator Tommy Goodman [Andre Braugher]: of course that doesn't eliminate Vail's ultimate ethical responsibility, but contrarily to the movie, at least he doesn't ""borrow"" the tape from the crime scene himself, and he doesn't know in advance what Tommy is up to).  Further, in the book the tape is not shown in open court and immediately introduced into evidence but viewed in the presence of only the judge and the attorneys, which given its contents seems more realistic (even if it were later introduced into evidence after all).  On the other hand, particularly regarding the main characters the movie's alterations work well:  Unethical or not, Richard Gere's Martin Vail is even more interesting than the character devised by Diehl; moreover, an unnecessarily cliched, ultraconservative judge nicknamed ""Hangin'"" Harry Shoat becomes an - although still tough - overall more multidimensional Judge Miriam Shoat (Alfre Woodard); similarly, Vail's mafia-affiliated client Joey Pinero (Steven Bauer) gains considerably in stature; and although it actually reinforces cliche to shift the love/sex relationship from the book's present one between Vail and psychiatrist Dr. Arrington (Frances McDormand) to the screenplay's past one between Vail and Venable (which the ADA now derogatorily calls ""a one-night-stand [that] lasted six months""), thanks to Gere's and Linney's considerable on-screen chemistry their characters' personal relationship adds sparks and tension to their professional rivalry that also lend greater credibility to the final courtroom scene's powder-keg explosion.Outstanding as all of its actors are, however, ""Primal Fear"" rises and falls with the performance of Edward Norton, and it is his breathtaking achievement that validates the movie more than anything.  Then-newcomer Norton not only had to portray a boy almost a decade younger than himself (which he manages flawlessly) but also an incredibly complex character, sometimes shifting behavioral patterns, accents and manners of speech from one sentence to the next; and he delivers supremely, deservedly garnering an Oscar nomination (which in a year of extremely tight competition he lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. for ""Jerry Maguire""), as well as a Golden Globe and several other awards, and together with his roles in ""People vs. Larry Flynt"" and Woody Allen's ""Everybody Says I Love You"" playing himself into public awareness once and, hopefully, for all.Although ""Primal Fear"" is often cited for its final plot twist, anybody who has seen more than that occasional thriller can see its end coming somewhere halfway through the narrative (and I think that's true for both book and film - although I admit I hadn't read the novel when I first saw the movie).  Moreover, the final twist depends on a feat on the part of Norton's character that lawyers and psychiatrists alike will find hard to take at face value.  Thus, at first viewing this movie's end may appear a bit of a let-down.  But trust me:  The story grows on you the more often you watch it, and in my view it actually helps to know the end, because not only does this enable you to see the many nuances you necessarily missed the first time around; it also frees you to think about the moral issues addressed.  For those reasons, and for the entire cast's - first and foremost Edward Norton's - fine performances, this has long become one of my favorite courtroom thrillers.""[I believe that] things are not always as they appear, that sometimes facts can be manipulated the way a magician manipulates an audience.  He distracts you with this hand, while the other hand does the tricks.  It's called misdirection."" - ""Primal Fear,"" preface: from Martin Vail's summation in a case entitled ""The State vs. Nicholas Luma.""Also recommended:Primal FearPresumed InnocentThe Burden of

""Primal Fear"" is an excellent adaptation of the William Diehl bestselling novel, using a stupendous cast, an equally riveting screenplay by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman, and fine direction from virtually unknown Gregory Hoblit.  Red herrings and duplicitous plot twists are woven tightly into the film about a hotshot defense attorney named Martin Vail (Richard Gere) who goes looking for the limelight and finds it filled with shadows.When a popular archBishop is brutally murdered in his illustrious home, a terrifyed young altar boy (in an exceptional, eerie role by newcomer Edward Norton--who would later become a star because of the film)is arrested as a suspect and held into custody.  Due to the magnitude of the case, Vail leeches onto it and decides to defend the young man.  Little does he know that he will uncover a viper's nest of corruption, pit him against a prosectuor (Laura Linney in a fine role) who happens to be his ex-lover, and hope to find the truth of a case that tests his will and win-at-all-costs attitude.Gere is stupendous as the fame-hungry, confident lawyer, while Norton steals the film as he reveals the inner demons of the poor suspect.  ""Primal Fear"" is one of the most well-made thrillers of the 1990's and is a film that emphasizes what is right and wrong about our judicial system, questions the legitimacy of the courtroom, and taps into a fear of the psychological unknown.

126147,A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D,0792140346,"Thomas ""moviedudereviews""","[12, 14]","Primal Fear is one of those movies you must see regardless whether or not you are a Richard Gere fan. Why? Simply because of Edward Norton's character. Martin Vail (Richard Gere) is a big shot attorney who defends Norton for free just so he can get some big time public recognition even though he already has it. Laura Linney is the prosecutor who also happens to be Vail's ex-girlfriend. Despite the story being interesting from start to finish, there is a big twist in the end due to the talented acting by Edward Norton. Now onto the DVD... Though the film is presented in widescreen, the bottom portion of the picture is cropped. This is not a huge problem if you have a widescreen TV yet is still very noticable.

The case is intriguing and did what seldom movies can do, surprise me. There is an ending to this film that will just completely blow you away. As for the rest of the film, it was extremely entertaining thanks to the outstanding cast, that features both Richard Gere and a very young, Edward Norton, in one of his first roles. At the time Norton was a no-name, while Gere was the big star. Who would have thought that eventually Norton would become the bigger name? Well, anyone who saw this film and the absolutely tremendous performance Norton gives. To be honest, most court room dramas don't surprise me. You can always tell if the suspect is guilty or innocent, and there is usually some kind of twist in the story. Primal Fear was not so cut and dry, I kept going back and fourth on the suspects guilt or innocence myself. That's because this is a powerful movie, with an unrivaled cast, written by a professional novelist, as opposed to some amateur screenwriter. Primal Fear is a perfect example of what it takes to create a great movie, and after you watch it, let me know if you can figure out where the title comes from.

Vail is a defense attorney and one of the highest paid lawyers in the country.  He has a reputation for getting guilty people off the hook, whether it is by emotion or technicality.  Sometimes the accused are actually innocents, but the media never seems to recognize that.  Besides, many of Vail's trial have been huge public trials full of media circuses.  So when Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), an innocent-looking, stuttering altar boy is accused of brutally murdering Local Archbishop Richard Rushman (Stanley Anderson), Vail jumps at the opportunity to defend Stampler pro bono.  Along the way, Vail becomes convinced of Stampler's innocence.  The evidence points directly to Stampler, but as the story unfolds it becomes apparent that someone besides Stampler killed Rushman.I've seen PRIMAL FEAR a number of times and though the initial shock of the film is dampened after the first viewing, the movie is still a powerful picture.

The smarm around women, that &quot;Aren't I just God's gift to women&quot; smile, just makes me want to puke!

Too many loose ends! The plot stretches belief too much to make viewing enjoyable.

Why? Because he's that good. He's known for his rough tactics as well as his brilliant performances in the courtroom. He loves being in court as much as he loves seeing his name in print and his face on the evening news. He believes ""that a person is innocent until proven guilty"" and believes in the basic goodness in people. He simply loves the law.When Chicago's beloved Archbishop Rushman is stabbed to death (78 times) in his rectory and a blood-soaked alter boy (Edward Norton) is arrested as the prime and only suspect, Vail can't resist being the first to offer his services - pro bono. Aaron Stampler is the 19-year-old alter boy who claims he didn't kill the Archbishop. He says he was in the room at the time of the murder, but that there was a third person there and he blacked out. His stuttering Kentucky mountain accent and angelic boy scout look is only the beginning to a great defense.Janet Venable (Laura Linney), a former girlfriend of Vail, is the prosecutor assigned to this case. I think she's looking forward to butting heads with Vail again. Her bosses want the death penalty and nothing less.Based on the novel of murder and suspense by William Diehl, we've got a truly star-studded jackpot with ""Primal Fear."" The characters were so well written in the book, it must not have been too difficult to convert to film. It's easy to love and/or hate each character.Richard Gere is always brilliant, putting everything he's got into each role. This character, Martin Vail, reminds me of his Edward Lewis in ""Pretty Woman."" He loves his job, actually lives it, makes a ton of money, is very arrogant, confident, brilliant, very charming, clever, persuasive and thorough. First-class performance.Edward Norton got the role of a lifetime when he landed this character, Aaron Stampler - the role that put him on the Hollywood map. When actors are too good, they sometimes pay the price with me. Norton was a little TOO good and a little TOO convincing here. I hated him. His role in ""Keeping the Faith,"" with Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman, was where he redeemed himself. (I love him now.) ""Keeping the Faith"" was also his directorial debut. More great performances from Norton in ""Rounders"" and ""Fight Club."" Also, if you liked him in ""Primal Fear,"" you must see ""The Score"" (also starring Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando). You'll see some similarities that I'm not at liberty to discuss. Just trust me!A slew of other great actors are in ""Primal Fear:"" LAURA LINNEY of ""The Mothman Prophecies"" (with Richard Gere), ""Congo,"" and ""Absolute Power"" (played Clint Eastwood's daughter). JOHN MAHONEY is a corrupt city official here who's a long-time friend of the late Archbishop. Mahoney plays the father in TV's ""Frasier,"" and was also in ""The American President"" (Annette Bening's boss), ""Eight Men Out,"" ""She's the One,"" and played Judge Helms in ""Suspect.""
