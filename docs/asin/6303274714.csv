367958,A3U6ACF89PWAYP,6303274714,"B. Bratton ""Bren Bratt""","[1, 2]","Henry Cele plays the South African Zulu King, ""Shaka Zulu."" Shaka - meaning in Zulu, ""the disease of the beetle,"" was rejected by his Father, Prince of a small Zulu village, and his Mother, Nandie, put through humiliating public displays of disdain by Shaka's Father. That rejection made Shaka into a young man who would be King with a hardened heart. Though he unified all Zulu people, he became a tyrannical leader who ruled with absolute power and authority. This is a true story of a Warrior King of South Africa who trusted very few people and felt that he could not love because of the pain his Father had inflicted upon his Mother, his Grandmother who died fleeing his Father's death sentence and himself. Shaka's curious nature about the Europeans is very interesting as he learns how to write and interpret the Europeans intentions after their arrival on the Cape of South Africa. This film is necessary viewing for anyone interested in Africa. Henry Cele's performance is beyond excellent. Cele was a star soccer player for South Africa in the 1970s.",5,"""Shaka Zulu"" Is A Must-See",1197331200,"12 11, 2007",2007,1060,"['Henry', 'Cele', 'South', 'African', 'Zulu', 'King', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'Shaka', 'meaning', 'Zulu', 'disease', 'beetle', 'was', 'rejected', 'Father', 'Prince', 'small', 'Zulu', 'village', 'Mother', 'Nandie', 'put', 'humiliating', 'public', 'displays', 'disdain', 'Shaka', 'Father', 'rejection', 'made', 'Shaka', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'King', 'hardened', 'heart', 'unified', 'Zulu', 'people', 'became', 'tyrannical', 'leader', 'who', 'ruled', 'absolute', 'power', 'authority', 'true', 'story', 'Warrior', 'King', 'South', 'Africa', 'who', 'trusted', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'felt', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'pain', 'Father', 'had', 'inflicted', 'Mother', 'Grandmother', 'who', 'died', 'fleeing', 'Father', 'death', 'sentence', 'Shaka', 'curious', 'nature', 'Europeans', 'very', 'interesting', 'how', 'write', 'interpret', 'Europeans', 'intentions', 'arrival', 'Cape', 'South', 'Africa', 'film', 'necessary', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'interested', 'Africa', 'Henry', 'Cele', 'performance', 'excellent', 'Cele', 'was', 'star', 'soccer', 'player', 'South', 'Africa', '1970s']",Shaka Zulu VHS
367959,A2S5CQ07GRC63V,6303274714,"featherstonhaugh ""featherstonhaugh""","[4, 4]","In Cy Endfield's 'Zulu' and the sequel 'Zulu Dawn', as well as an awful faux-patrician accent by the young Michael Caine (stick to cockney roles please Michael!) we encountered the Zulu nation merely as a monolithic black asegi-waving horde that was obliging enough to offer itself up as canon fodder to the measured firepower of British redcoats. However, we learned nothing about the Zulus as individuals or as a people suffice that they were brave and had a certain respect for the bravery shown by their foes. In Shaka Zulu, we encounter these magnificent people 'National Geographic' style with the capable telling of the origins and eventual pre-eminence of Shaka Zulu, the father of the Zulu nation.Make no mistake, though. Shaka's not the kind of guy you'd invite home to meet the parents. He ranks alongside Darius, Atilla, Stalin and Hitler as one of the great despotic rulers of all time. The story is told in two threads: the first strand involves a group of English emmissaries sent to parlay (and stall) Shaka as his expansionism began to threaten the Cape Colony.The second (and more interesting thread by far) tells the story of Shaka's mother, Nandi, and how she overcame unbelievable adversity in siring Shaka against great social prejudice and how her sick little boy grew up to become one of the most feared men in Africa. Simply marvellous stuff with brilliant vintage performances by Henri Cele as Shaka, as well as Edward Fox and Robert Powell.As Jack Hawkins' reverend Witt character said in 'Zulu', &quot;the Zulu are a great people!&quot; You better believe it.",5,Authentic insight into the Zulu peoples,979344000,"01 13, 2001",2001,1587,"['Cy', 'Endfield', ""'Zulu"", 'sequel', 'Dawn', 'as', 'well', 'awful', 'faux-patrician', 'accent', 'young', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'stick', 'cockney', 'roles', 'please', 'Michael', 'encountered', 'Zulu', 'nation', 'merely', 'monolithic', 'black', 'asegi-waving', 'horde', 'was', 'obliging', 'enough', 'offer', 'up', 'canon', 'fodder', 'measured', 'firepower', 'British', 'redcoats', 'However', 'learned', 'nothing', 'Zulus', 'individuals', 'people', 'suffice', 'were', 'brave', 'had', 'certain', 'respect', 'bravery', 'shown', 'foes', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'encounter', 'magnificent', 'people', ""'National"", 'Geographic', 'style', 'capable', 'telling', 'origins', 'eventual', 'pre-eminence', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'father', 'Zulu', 'nation.Make', 'mistake', 'though', 'Shaka', 'not', 'kind', 'guy', ""'d"", 'invite', 'home', 'meet', 'parents', 'alongside', 'Darius', 'Atilla', 'Stalin', 'Hitler', 'one', 'great', 'despotic', 'rulers', 'time', 'story', 'told', 'two', 'threads', 'first', 'strand', 'group', 'English', 'emmissaries', 'sent', 'parlay', 'stall', 'Shaka', 'expansionism', 'began', 'threaten', 'Cape', 'Colony.The', 'second', 'more', 'interesting', 'thread', 'far', 'story', 'Shaka', 'mother', 'Nandi', 'how', 'unbelievable', 'adversity', 'siring', 'Shaka', 'great', 'social', 'prejudice', 'how', 'sick', 'little', 'boy', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'one', 'most', 'feared', 'men', 'Africa', 'Simply', 'marvellous', 'stuff', 'brilliant', 'vintage', 'performances', 'Henri', 'Cele', 'Shaka', 'as', 'well', 'Edward', 'Fox', 'Robert', 'Powell.As', 'Jack', 'Hawkins', 'reverend', 'Witt', 'character', 'said', ""'Zulu"", 'quot', 'Zulu', 'are', 'great', 'people', 'quot', 'better', 'believe']",Shaka Zulu VHS

367961,A2BSZPRBKYAB2K,6303274714,"Joe Owen ""Joe""","[16, 18]","This is an outstanding series.  This tells of the rise and power of the Warrior King Shaka Zulu.  Shaka Zulu ruled with an iron fist over the Zulu Nation (current day South Africa) for over 30 years.  Henry Cele portrays the powerful leader in a convincing way.  This series never has a dull moment and is riveting to watch.  Shaka Zulu was embittered towards his father who was a Zulu King due to his harsh treatment of his mother, sister, and grandmother and it is Shaka's quest to bring him to justice and to take over as King.Eventually, Shaka Zulu completes his goals and crowns himself King of the mighty Zulu Nation.  The Zulu's were fierce warriors, just ask the British and the Boers.  A European missionary who was in the Zulu territory said that the landscape was littered with bones and skulls due to Shaka Zulu's fierceness of battle and conquest.The story does end with the downfall and death of Shaka Zulu, as all mighty leaders must fall and die over due course, but Shaka Zulu definitely had a full life.  He was cunning, a brilliant battle strategist and a great warrior, he is one of the few true conquerors of history, and is yet overlooked due to Western Civilizations ignorance of African history.  Hopefully, one day this will be solved.  There was controversy at the time of the making of this film in 1983 due to it being filmed and produced in Apartheid South Africa, but the film and the director due the Zulu's justice.  It does not take anything away from the story and the proud history of the Zulu tribe.This film is highly recommended to those who enjoy a riveting film about battle, treachery, revenge and triumph.  The historical accuracy is also quite good with just a few minor details that were not true, but overall it is a good historical portrait of the mighty Shaka Zulu.",5,Outstanding and important part of African History,1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,1812,"['outstanding', 'series', 'rise', 'power', 'Warrior', 'King', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'ruled', 'iron', 'fist', 'Zulu', 'Nation', 'current', 'day', 'South', 'Africa', '30', 'years', 'Henry', 'Cele', 'powerful', 'leader', 'convincing', 'way', 'series', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'riveting', 'watch', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'was', 'embittered', 'father', 'who', 'was', 'Zulu', 'King', 'due', 'harsh', 'treatment', 'mother', 'sister', 'grandmother', 'Shaka', 'quest', 'bring', 'justice', 'take', 'over', 'King.Eventually', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'goals', 'crowns', 'King', 'mighty', 'Zulu', 'Nation', 'Zulu', 'were', 'fierce', 'warriors', 'just', 'ask', 'British', 'Boers', 'European', 'missionary', 'who', 'was', 'Zulu', 'territory', 'said', 'landscape', 'was', 'littered', 'bones', 'skulls', 'due', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'fierceness', 'battle', 'conquest.The', 'story', 'end', 'downfall', 'death', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'mighty', 'leaders', 'must', 'fall', 'die', 'due', 'course', 'Shaka', 'Zulu', 'definitely', 'had', 'full', 'life', 'was', 'cunning', 'brilliant', 'battle', 'strategist', 'great', 'warrior', 'one', 'few', 'true', 'conquerors', 'history', 'yet', 'overlooked', 'due', 'Western', 'Civilizations', 'ignorance', 'African', 'history', 'Hopefully', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'solved', 'was', 'controversy', 'time', 'making', 'film', '1983', 'due', 'being', 'filmed', 'produced', 'Apartheid', 'South', 'Africa', 'film', 'director', 'due', 'Zulu', 'justice', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'story', 'proud', 'history', 'Zulu', 'tribe.This', 'film', 'highly', 'recommended', 'who', 'enjoy', 'riveting', 'film', 'battle', 'treachery', 'revenge', 'triumph', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'just', 'few', 'minor', 'details', 'were', 'not', 'true', 'overall', 'good', 'historical', 'portrait', 'mighty', 'Shaka', 'Zulu']",Shaka Zulu VHS
367962,A3KSW2CDMNMN34,6303274714,Mr. James A. Newton,"[9, 9]","The video is great; the one unfortunate aspect being that it is edited from the original TV series to a degree in which some of the characters do not fulfill their personalities and impact upon the life of Shaka. Aspects of Shaka's childhood have been left out that appeared in the TV series and which greatly help to clarify some of his later actions and personality traits. Yet another thing I found disappointing is that it is told from the point of a white man, a needless aspect.In spite of this though it is a great story of a little known part of African history documenting the difficult childhood of Shaka, his rise to prominence and forging of the Zulu Empire from a kingdom of a few thousand to one of hundreds of thousands.Some great characterizations, a particular favourite being Shaka's maiden aunt Mkabayi. If anyone is interested they may also want to purchase E.A. Ritter's book 'Shaka Zulu' which explores many of the myths surrounding Shaka.
