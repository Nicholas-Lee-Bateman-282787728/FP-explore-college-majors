I really like that the first workout is the yoga and the second one is the pilates.  It is like two tapes in one.  The only thing I don't like is she talks too much before beginning the yoga segment, but you can fast forward over that part.  I would say both workouts help me to feel better in that I feel awake from all the deep breathing Denise has you do and the flowing movements.  It is mildly challenging for someone in pretty good shape like me.  The yoga tape is pretty easy to follow and is a quick introduction to yoga if you are not familiar with the art.  The Pilates segment is great for the abdominals and is a bit more challenging, but still pretty easy.  Denise always makes me feel good about myself with her positive affirmations.  I feel like at least I exercised for 20 minutes on those days when I did not get up early enough.  I have done it in the evening also, but somehow I prefer doing this tape in the morning.  I have also turned it into a longer workout by doing both workouts.

She features a flowing style of yoga, where each pose flows into the next- which certainly helps it be more aerobic.  It loses the medatative and breath component of traditional yoga.  She does basic yoga moves- sun salutations, downward dog, warrior 1/2 etc.The Pilates section is a great ab workout- focusing on the core with traditional pilates moves such as: the hundred and single leg stretch.  I found the pilates section more challenging and a great intro to pilates.I liked the fact that both yoga and pilates were covered and that the length of each section was 20 minutes- it allows you to do the exercise within a short amount of time.

I use a couple of her older DVD's here and there, but getting through 20-30 minutes of her voice is enough to make me want to jump out of a window.  I often find myself screaming at the tv ""stop doing that stupid breathy BS talk and tell me where my freakin leg is supposed to go!!"" - but I digress.I think honestly, you can't do a 20 minute yoga session and actually expect it to be useful/effective.  Unless you are just running through some stretches, breathing and a few flows like Sun Salutation to get you started in the morning or centered in the evening, any short yoga video will be pretty pointless.  But leave it to Denise to try to pack in as many possible stupid poses that you hold for about a millisecond before awkwardly trying to contort your body to the next ineffectual pose, and the next and the next....you get my point.  I've been practicing vinyasa/ashtanga yoga for a number of years, and it's hard to find DVD's that are well-suited to someone who does not need a lot of instruction, but you still need CUES especially if you are just making up your own names for poses.  It's also, in my opinion, a dangerous DVD since the lack of instruction, lack of prep to get into a pose, lack of effectively holding/stretching, has probably caused quite a few newbies some undue pain!

Not only do I feel great afterwards but I feel good immediately into this workout.  Each stretch feels meaningful and has an impact.

If anyone out there knows of other &quot;functional yoga&quot; tapes, let me know because I love this style.  This tape has the added benefit of being broken up into two sections, so you can do either one section or do them both if you have time.  This tape is very time efficient, no ultra long pauses for mediation, just flowing yoga.I think others are critical of this tape because Denise is pretty and blond and they have a hard time taking her as a serious yoga practitioner.  But I find her nice and warm and a fine exercise instructor.",5,Power Yoga Plus,1045785600,"02 21, 2003",2003,939,"['just', 'love', 'video', 'have', 'lots', 'classical', 'yoga', 'tapes', 'one', 'favorite', 'Why', 'Not', 'only', 'do', 'feel', 'great', 'afterwards', 'feel', 'good', 'immediately', 'workout', 'stretch', 'feels', 'meaningful', 'impact', 'also', 'love', 'flow', 'yoga', 'how', 'quot', 'functional', 'yoga', 'quot', 'where', 'pose', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'classical', 'yoga', 'wonderful', 'anyone', 'there', 'knows', 'other', 'quot', 'functional', 'yoga', 'quot', 'tapes', 'let', 'know', 'love', 'style', 'tape', 'added', 'benefit', 'being', 'broken', 'up', 'two', 'sections', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'section', 'do', 'have', 'time', 'tape', 'very', 'time', 'efficient', 'ultra', 'long', 'pauses', 'mediation', 'just', 'flowing', 'yoga.I', 'think', 'others', 'are', 'critical', 'tape', 'Denise', 'pretty', 'blond', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'taking', 'serious', 'yoga', 'practitioner', 'find', 'nice', 'warm', 'fine', 'exercise', 'instructor']",N/A
