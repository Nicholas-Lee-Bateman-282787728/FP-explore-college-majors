31212,AY8FI73B2HWXB,0780622383,Ada Ardor,"[0, 0]","I enjoyed the book, and I also liked the film.  I just wish there was more of Kathy Bates/Dolores Claiborne and Judy Parfitt/Vera Donovan, and that their scenes were not so often interrupted with scenes from the present.  Their scenes were so electric; they both had so much bite.  You could see real love and tenderness between them.  Vera Donovan formerly formidable but trying to keep her dignity towards the end, losing the love of her children after her brazen action, and Dolores Claiborne affectionate and wounded enough to exchange barbs.  I also wish the confrontation between Jennifer Jason Leigh/Selena St. George and Christopher Plummer/Detective Mackey were not so maudlin.  In a lesser actress, the scene would have totally sank, but Jennifer Jason Leigh was vulnerable and awkward enough in that scene to carry it.  This is one of Stephen King's better film adaptions.  It's a good story, mostly because of Kathy Bates, who is just amazing in EVERYTHING.  She is renown as a great actress, and I still don't think that's a good enough of an adjective to describe her.  She was stellar in everything - comedic and demonic and dramatic.  She was delicious in The Office and American Horror Story:  Coven.  Such diverse roles - is there anything she can't do?  A very good film because of her.  She elevated the film.",4,All hail the great Kathy Bates,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",2014,1329,"['enjoyed', 'book', 'also', 'liked', 'film', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'more', 'Kathy', 'Bates/Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'Judy', 'Parfitt/Vera', 'Donovan', 'scenes', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'often', 'interrupted', 'scenes', 'present', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'electric', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'bite', 'could', 'see', 'real', 'love', 'tenderness', 'Vera', 'Donovan', 'formerly', 'formidable', 'trying', 'keep', 'dignity', 'end', 'losing', 'love', 'children', 'brazen', 'action', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'affectionate', 'wounded', 'enough', 'exchange', 'barbs', 'also', 'wish', 'confrontation', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh/Selena', 'St.', 'George', 'Christopher', 'Plummer/Detective', 'Mackey', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'maudlin', 'lesser', 'actress', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'totally', 'sank', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'was', 'vulnerable', 'awkward', 'enough', 'scene', 'carry', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'better', 'film', 'adaptions', 'good', 'story', 'mostly', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'just', 'amazing', 'EVERYTHING', 'renown', 'great', 'actress', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'good', 'enough', 'adjective', 'describe', 'was', 'stellar', 'everything', 'comedic', 'demonic', 'dramatic', 'was', 'delicious', 'Office', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Coven', 'Such', 'diverse', 'roles', 'anything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'A', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'her', 'elevated', 'film']",Dolores Claiborne VHS

31216,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0780622383,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","If you're expecting another `Misery' then you should walk away from this right now.  While the main components may be the same (Steven King source; Kathy Bates performance) the end result couldn't be more different.  This doesn't feel much like a horror movie as much as a psychological thriller, but that really shouldn't repel anyone from this great film.  You just have to know what you are in for.  So, I'll rephrase my opening statement.If you're expecting another `Misery' then you should wipe away all expectations and soak in this film for what it is and not what you think it is supposed to be.`Dolores Claiborne' tells the story of Dolores, a middle-aged woman working as a housekeeper in Maine.  When her employer Vera winds up dead and Claiborne is found standing over her dead body with a weapon in hand it is only expected that she would wind up being the prime suspect.  Dolores's grown daughter Selena, now working as a journalist, comes to see her mother during the investigation.  They haven't spoken in years, and their reunion only stirs up awful memories of Selena's childhood and her father Joe who wound up dead when she was still quite young.  Her mother was prime suspect at the time, but lack of evidence kept her from behind bars.  The Detective who worked Joe's murder case is also working Vera's and his grudge against Dolores is what may wind up bringing closure to both these deaths.The storytelling here is amazing, for the film flows like a well written novel in that it manages to flesh out each and every scene.  Sure, it could have been tightened in a few areas, but for the most part it is very fluid in its delivery.The real showcase here though is the acting.  Kathy Bates is stellar as Dolores, delivering an award worthy performance that is the stark opposite of her Oscar winning turn in `Misery'.  She is calm and reclusive and very guarded, but her inner suffering is boiling right under her skin.  Judy Parfitt is also quite wonderful as Vera, Dolores's strong willed employer.  Christopher Plummer is always outstanding, and his gruff delivery here brings his stock character to another level; and David Strathairn is unforgettable as the sadistic Joe.  A lot of praise is heaped up Jennifer Jason Leigh in general.  Many people consider her this amazing actress who is Oscar snubbed over and over but I can't really find a reason to consider her all that noteworthy.  Everything I've seen of her has been decent at best, this performance included.  I found her serviceable, and at times she was great, but nothing extraordinary, and nothing that most other actresses couldn't pull off.I wish that the film had been a little more intense, I will say that.  The film flows almost so serenely that it lacks any real bite.  This isn't a horrible thing, but it takes a little away from the end result.  When the revelations were revealed it didn't feel so shocking or spine chilling because I felt numbed over by the films fluidity.  It's a small gripe when you look at the big picture, but it's a gripe none-the-less.  All in all though, `Dolores Claiborne' is a great film that is sure to satisfy any fan of the genre, the writer or the star.",4,This is not `Misery' redux; just so you know...,1221782400,"09 19, 2008",2008,3186,"[""'re"", 'expecting', 'Misery', 'then', 'should', 'walk', 'away', 'right', 'now', 'main', 'components', 'may', 'be', 'same', 'Steven', 'King', 'source', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'performance', 'end', 'result', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', ""n't"", 'feel', 'much', 'horror', 'movie', 'as', 'much', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'really', 'should', ""n't"", 'repel', 'anyone', 'great', 'film', 'just', 'have', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'So', ""'ll"", 'rephrase', 'opening', 'statement.If', ""'re"", 'expecting', 'Misery', 'then', 'should', 'wipe', 'away', 'expectations', 'soak', 'film', 'what', 'not', 'what', 'think', 'supposed', 'be.', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'story', 'Dolores', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'working', 'housekeeper', 'Maine', 'When', 'employer', 'Vera', 'up', 'dead', 'Claiborne', 'found', 'standing', 'dead', 'body', 'weapon', 'hand', 'only', 'expected', 'would', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'prime', 'suspect', 'Dolores', 'grown', 'daughter', 'Selena', 'now', 'working', 'journalist', 'see', 'mother', 'investigation', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'years', 'reunion', 'only', 'up', 'awful', 'memories', 'Selena', 'childhood', 'father', 'Joe', 'who', 'wound', 'up', 'dead', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'quite', 'young', 'mother', 'was', 'prime', 'suspect', 'time', 'lack', 'evidence', 'kept', 'bars', 'Detective', 'who', 'worked', 'Joe', 'murder', 'case', 'also', 'working', 'Vera', 'grudge', 'Dolores', 'what', 'may', 'wind', 'up', 'bringing', 'closure', 'deaths.The', 'storytelling', 'here', 'amazing', 'film', 'well', 'written', 'novel', 'flesh', 'out', 'scene', 'Sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'tightened', 'few', 'areas', 'most', 'part', 'very', 'fluid', 'delivery.The', 'real', 'showcase', 'here', 'acting', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'stellar', 'Dolores', 'delivering', 'award', 'worthy', 'performance', 'stark', 'opposite', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'turn', 'Misery', 'calm', 'reclusive', 'very', 'guarded', 'inner', 'suffering', 'boiling', 'right', 'skin', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'also', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'Vera', 'Dolores', 'strong', 'willed', 'employer', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'always', 'outstanding', 'gruff', 'delivery', 'here', 'stock', 'character', 'level', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'unforgettable', 'sadistic', 'Joe', 'lot', 'praise', 'heaped', 'up', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'general', 'Many', 'people', 'consider', 'amazing', 'actress', 'who', 'Oscar', 'snubbed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'reason', 'consider', 'noteworthy', 'Everything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'been', 'decent', 'best', 'performance', 'included', 'found', 'serviceable', 'times', 'was', 'great', 'nothing', 'extraordinary', 'nothing', 'most', 'other', 'actresses', 'could', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off.I', 'wish', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'little', 'more', 'intense', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'almost', 'so', 'serenely', 'real', 'bite', ""n't"", 'horrible', 'thing', 'little', 'away', 'end', 'result', 'When', 'revelations', 'were', 'revealed', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'shocking', 'spine', 'chilling', 'felt', 'numbed', 'films', 'fluidity', 'small', 'gripe', 'when', 'look', 'big', 'picture', 'gripe', 'none-the-less', 'Claiborne', 'great', 'film', 'sure', 'satisfy', 'fan', 'genre', 'writer', 'star']",Dolores Claiborne VHS

Kathy Bates is pretty much the one-woman tour de force of the film. She can be pretentious in her acting at times but not in Dolores Claiborne. Rather, she captures the same magic she had in Misery, a performance that she deservingly won the Oscar for. I am surprised she wasn't nominated again for Dolores Claiborne. Oh, well. On the other hand, I have mixed feelings about Jennifer Jason Leigh's work in Dolores Claiborne. I admit that she was 100% annoying and a spoiled brat throughout the film, but I am going to be objective and say that she did a marvelous job. The story of Dolores Claiborne is captivating to watch and keeps me glued to the end. It is a fine piece of storytelling by Taylor Hackford who is actually a pretty good storyteller himself as demonstrated in Everybody's All-American, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, The Idolmaker, Blood In, Blood Out; and the ever classic An Officer and a Gentleman. Finally, who is the biggest winner of the film? Judy Parfitt. Hey...who is that? Guess it? Vera Donovan. A real classic performance. Once again, I am very surprised that Dolores Claiborne wasn't acknowledged for the awards that it deserved to be nominated for. The performances were very good, and the filmmaking was as excellent.

It's a low-key drama. But that's OK. For the viewers who are tired of juvenile special effects, and paper-thin plots, this is a welcome change of pace. There's actually a story to appreciate, though it's a heart-breaking one. We're witnessing the emotional distance between Dolores and her hurt and resentful, adult daughter. It's not a pleasant experience. But we're made to care about these characters. As the story unfolds, and we learn delicate secrets from 15 years before, the film never bores us with silly side plots, or meaningless gimmicks.Instead, the emphasis is on failed relationships, and missed opportunities. Dolores puts up  - temporarily, anyway - with the abuse of her sadistic, self-indulgent husband. Her hands are shriveled, from endless hours, and years, of cleaning her employer's mansion of a house. Do they hate each other? Or is there actually a bond which we can't initially see? Dolores has a tenuous connection with her daughter, who grudgingly travels up to coastal Maine, from Manhattan, to somehow lend support to a mother she hasn't seen in 15 years -- who's ready to be charged with murder. It's a complicated, but intriguing tale which kept me riveted to this movie, wondering how it was all going to develop, and end. I wasn't disappointed.One quibble: While I really admire it, I'm a little dismayed by one aspect of the film. Each time I've seen it, I've appreciated not only the acting and the script, but the fact that it takes place on the coast of Maine. Over the last few years, I've been overwhelmed by the beauty of that place, and enjoy seeing it portrayed on the screen. (e.g. ""The Man Without A Face""; ""In The Bedroom"".) That's what I thought was the case with ""Dolores Claiborne"". But, according to the credits which follow the film, the whole thing was actually filmed in Nova Scotia. It doesn't take away from film's dramatic power.

Ultimately, I believe the movie was not formally recognized by the Hollywood community because they simply could not handle the subject matter.For the men that control things, this movies strikes too close to home.

Ironically, all three books (and the movies) don't belong to horror genre. They are the combination of many genres, including crime, drama, and thriller. ""Dolores Claiborne"" which is the story told by its main character explores many difficult subjects - failed marriages that result in dysfunctional families, relationship between a mother and a daughter and how far would a mother go to protect her child.Dolores Claiborne works for many years as a maid for wealthy and demanding Vera Donovan and after Vera's suspicious death is accused of murdering her employer. Det. John Mackey (Christopher Plumber), the shrewd investigator is absolutely sure that Dolores not only murdered Vera who left her a fortune but is also guilty of murdering her husband many years ago but never was charged for that crime. Dolores's daughter Selena (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a successful reporter who had not talked to her mother for years comes from New York City to cover the story. Who is Dolores - a greedy monster and a murderer or an unhappy woman for whom an accident is sometimes a best friend? Kathy Bates received the Oscar for her portrayal of a psychotic nurse in another King's adaptation, ""Misery"" but I believe that Dolores Claiborne is her best role. She carries the film and I don't think that any other actress could fit the part as well as Bates did which brings the question - maybe King wrote the book with her in mind, who knows? Judy Parfitt is extremely well cast as Vera Donovan, an arrogant ice queen, who was capable of understanding and care for Dolores and her daughter and who knew too well about loneliness and despair.

Their chemistry is fantastic, the performances riveting and finally truly touching. I loved the setting, and the eclipse taking such a strong part in the story.  I loved this movie and what they did with this little vignette from the mind of Stephen King.  It's surprising how versatile some of his work can be.  I never read this story, but fans of this movie should also check out ""Bag of Bones"", the book, for another great ride which also steps somewhat outside the realm of ""horror"".  King's versatility is sometimes nothing short of amazing.

Yet after seeing this pristine 2.35 print and listening to Taylor Hackford's commentary, this film is clearly  an unsung gem.  I don't know whether Hackford is a angel or a terror to  work with, but I can't recall a better director's commentary.  I've gotten  so tired of all of these so-called commentaries where a group of people  (the director, some actors, various flunkies) sit around and make witless  jokes, meander wildly and say very little about the artistic process of  making the film in question.  Hackford, here, is all alone, and he talks  nonstop through the commentary, giving his co-workers enormous credit and  giving the viewer/listening a direct and perceptive discourse on the  process of making a film.  You'll understand more about Magritte, the  differences between Kodak and Fuji film, Nova Scotia and so much more by  the end.  Hackford's commentary is so heartfelt and persuasive, that you'll  want to rewatch the film again to appreciate the subtleties of his  incredible actors Bates and Leigh and of the film itself.  My only quibble  is that Hackford thinks that those blue screen shots towards the end look  real, when they look as weird as those Michael Mann blue screens in Heat.  The weirdness of the blue shots are fine for the film, but don't kid  yourself that they actually look like the real world.

31268,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,0780622383,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 6]"," Dolores Claiborne  is one of the most beautiful book by Stephen King. But the film, in spite of all the shortcuts it has to use, is even better because of one actress, Kathy Bates. She does not act. She lives on the screen, and that is so rare that it gives to the film the poignancy of real life. It is a rare story too. The story of three women and one man. The mother first who suffers everything for her daughter. She suffers the molesting for her husband because he is the father of her daughter. But yet she gets one day to the point where she can't stand it any more and she puts a stop to it, though it does not change much, except maybe that it makes this father  become bent onto vengeance. The daughter who is the apple of the eye of her mother and she is blind to the mistreatment of her mother because she is in love with her father. In love forever, even when this love is exploited by the father to turn the daughter into a surrogate of his wife. She will forget it, full stop, period and that will be all. Till the day she finally remembers. Finally the boss, Vera, a domineering woman who exploits Dolores as if she were a house slave. And yet it is a love story too, the love story of two women who were neglected and wounded by their husbands, the love of two women who managed to cause an accident to get rid of their husbands. The love of two women that are so much alike and yet so different that they are perfect doubles, braindoubles, just like we have bodydoubles in the cinema. The father is limited in his brain. He is an alcoholic. He is his own daughter's molester. Then the story is that of the coming back of the memory in the daughter's head eighteen years later. It is the story of several knots in the mental plots that the lives of these three women are. Vera finally commits suicide because her getting old makes her hate life and become so bitchy that it is unbearable even for herself. Vera begs for Dolores to finish her up and Dolores accepts though she is too late and she cannot perform. Yet this is the prompter of another desire for vengeance in the main inspector of the island who was not able to have Dolores indicted for the death of her husband. And the whole film becomes the defeat of this old vengeful and hateful detective who cannot see human feelings and human actions but through the narrowing glass of his hatred. This trio of women is a rare situation in Stephen King's books, maybe the only one. It is a lot deeper than the women portraits we have in  The Tommyknockers . It is deeper because it is only human, with no special effects and no aliens. Just plain human beings with their emotions, their fears and their hopes. And Kathy Bates transcend the plot to make it nothing but a voyage into real life. And it is real life indeed. Not a real life we dream of, but a real life we carry in our memory and in our deepest impulses. We know we would do the same thing if we were in those very same situations. And those situations occur everyday in our world. A thrilling psychological journey into the humanity of women for whom death has the taste of life and life the taste of torture.

Yet director Taylor Hackford manages to weave the various time frames together with such success and style.  A formidable Kathy Bates stars as the title character, a woman being investigated for the murder of her elderly employer.  The detective on the case, Christopher Plummer, wants to get her because years earlier he investigated her for the murder of her husband, but was not able to make anything stick.  Her long estranged daughter, Jennifer Jason Leigh, shows up, a woman on the edge who suspects her mother is guilty of both crimes.  As the investigation develops, the story of Dolores, her abusive husband, and her daughter is reminisced about, so that the truth and family secrets can come out.  This is a gripping film with a great visual style.  The present time sequences are filmed in washed out colours, very grey and pale blue, while the sequences from the past are photographed with vivid colours, as if the past is more alive than the present.  The climax of the film when we learn the truth of all that happened is particularly stunning and beautiful.

Eliminate the built-in narration provided for the lead character and instead write in a series of hallucinogenic flashbacks, and not only bring the grown daughter into the picture (again, intentionally written out by Stephen King), but make her the primary detective in a whodunit that attempts to very slowly answer the very obvious question of whether Kathy Bates killed her husband.Herp dee derp.I remembered this movie as being average but forgettable when I first watched it, but then took another look after reading the book and realized promptly that this is a two-star job.Other than a poorly filmed ""teaser"" at the opening, half an hour transpires in the film before we see a scene that had any place in the book whatsoever.  The majority of this half hour is spent following the grown daughter around (never see her in the book) and creating some irrelevant melodrama about romance with her editor (she is a writer) and ambitions about writing some irrelevant story about radiologists.This is one of the worst novel-to-screenplay conversions I've ever seen.  I realize it was the mid-1990s and you couldn't make a McDonalds commercial without throwing in a legal twist at the end...but for no reason whatsoever, we have a writer playing lawyer/detective and the whole thing actually culminates in a makeshift courtroom drama.Not to mention, the climax of the screenplay version hinges on the herpes virus of all plot devices - repressed memories!  Wait, it's coming back to me...  Oh my goodness, now I remember!I also got the impression that John C.

Oscars should have gone to director Taylor Hackford, the cinematographer, Danny Elfman's haunting score, and the acting, oh my.  Of course, Kathy Bates is overwhelming; Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better; Christopher Plummer certainly sheds his ""Sound of Music"" persona; Judy Parfit is unbelievably effective as bitchy Vera, but her portrayal is so dimensional that we come to care for her; Ms. Parfit's scene with the pig musicbox playing ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" is brilliant.  Also superb is Ellen Muth, who plays the young Selena, and John Reilly as the sheriff, who stands up to Plummer's state detective.

Her presence is just mesmerizing, and as much as her performance in Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes.. was brilliant, in Dolores Claiborne she really excels!!The film is over two hours, but the moment it opens, with an excellent haunting score by Danny Elfman,you will be transported on a dark journey that touches your heart, mind and soul and it will seem like few minutes have passed, after reading the end credits.Hackford's CV was 'studio' oriented to say the least, but in Dolores Clairborne, you discover an artist, who is capable of offering his viewer an intimate story with a lot of sensitivity.The visual transition between present and past which happens quite often, is very original, and adds to the power of the story.The DVD, although short on the extras, it has a very pleasent and unique surprise..a audio commentary by Hackford..Not on selected or deleted scenes (which directors nowadays deliberately include in DVDs to enhance the extras), but throughtout the whole film, scene by scene, recorded four years after its theatrical release!! which gives a lot of insight into the making of Dolores Clairborne, and it is as interesting to hear as watching the film.So Dolores Clairborne is a prime example of very talented people, offering their art with love to every cinema lover in the world.It is a MUST buy and should be added to your collection.",5,A Beautiful Piece of Moviemaking,1024358400,"06 18, 2002",2002,1883,"['Dolores', 'Clairborne', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'underlooked', 'underrated', 'films.The', 'film', 'dark', 'thriller', 'domestic', 'tragedy', 'story', 'friendships', 'about', 'psychological', 'traumas', 'revenge', 'obsessions', 'character', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'developed.Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'David', 'Strathain', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'give', 'very', 'powerful', 'performances', 'film', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'who', 'simply', 'best', 'working', 'actress', 'US', 'presence', 'just', 'mesmerizing', 'as', 'much', 'performance', 'Misery', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes..', 'was', 'brilliant', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'really', 'film', 'two', 'hours', 'moment', 'excellent', 'haunting', 'score', 'Danny', 'Elfman', 'will', 'be', 'transported', 'dark', 'journey', 'heart', 'mind', 'soul', 'will', 'seem', 'few', 'minutes', 'have', 'passed', 'reading', 'end', 'credits.Hackford', 'CV', 'was', ""'studio"", 'oriented', 'say', 'least', 'Dolores', 'Clairborne', 'discover', 'artist', 'who', 'capable', 'offering', 'viewer', 'intimate', 'story', 'lot', 'sensitivity.The', 'visual', 'transition', 'present', 'past', 'quite', 'often', 'very', 'original', 'power', 'story.The', 'DVD', 'short', 'extras', 'very', 'pleasent', 'unique', 'surprise..a', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Hackford..Not', 'selected', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'directors', 'deliberately', 'include', 'DVDs', 'enhance', 'extras', 'whole', 'film', 'scene', 'scene', 'recorded', 'four', 'years', 'theatrical', 'release', 'lot', 'insight', 'making', 'Dolores', 'Clairborne', 'interesting', 'hear', 'watching', 'film.So', 'Dolores', 'Clairborne', 'prime', 'example', 'very', 'talented', 'people', 'offering', 'art', 'love', 'cinema', 'lover', 'world.It', 'MUST', 'buy', 'should', 'be', 'added', 'collection']",Dolores Claiborne VHS

31305,A2NX5UZ6WEZF0R,0780622383,Movie Fan,"[13, 14]","Kathy Bates. We all know who she is. She starred in the classic movie misery as a mentally distured nurse and fan of her favorite writer whom she rescues and then he is help captive in her home. But Dolores Claiborne is different. It's a story about a maid(bates) who is accused of murder for the second time, first it was her husband, then her employer (Vira Donovon) who she had worked for for many years and then became her caregiver. It's a myserty/drama and a very enjoyable film even though there are some dark moments when Dolores is having flashbacks of her alcoholic abusive husband, and her daughter who she tried to protect. Vira Donovon makes the movie special because not only is her acting oscar worthy but her character is very likeable even though she appears to be a rich bitch at the beginning, but as you get to know her character you realize she's a good person, but just doesn't take crap from anyone. So is dolores claiborne, and it's really about women. How women are treated and these two women became such good friends because not only were they alike, but they had some similar problems. It's about friendship, female bonding, and what can i say GIRLPOWER! Being tough, but doing what's right. Being a good person but learning from your mistakes. Looking out for yourself, but help others every once and a while. And never judge a book by it's cover. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays selena st george, dolores's daughter who has emotional problems and is unstable but we all find out why. This movie is underated. Maybe many of you think it's about hating men, but not really. It just focus's on women and their strength and weaknesses, and sometimes doing the wrong thing for the right reason. Dolore's husband is suppose to be an unpleasant character and you can't help but not like him at all. And everyone has the right to defend themselves and their children. No one should take that. And even if you provoke someone, you can't make anyone do anything they don't wanna do. Bottom line is, self defense is self defense. It reminds me of EYE FOR AN EYE with sally field. In real life, Cops can set up a sting, and go undercover and provoke people, but if you commit a crime you go to jail. You're responsible for your own actions. If someone intends to do you bodily harm, you have the right to defend yourself, and your children. It's justifiable homicide. This movie, dolores claiborne is thought provoking, and focus's on some important issue's. It's just a movie and it can make you feel good because no woman should ever have to accept a husband like joe. That isn't love, and it sickens me that women protect their husbands no matter what they do to your kids or them, but no one should let that happen. First accept that the sitation needs to stop, but by stopping it, you have to make hard choices. And that's what this movie is about.",5,"BEST king movie, no horror flick here.

Right from the very start the audience is utterly gripped as we see Dolores (Kathy Bates) hovering over her employer (Parfit) with a rolling pin.  From then we go forward to the police investigator fronting the investigation into what happened in that house, trying to eke out his revenge for the death of Dolores's husband which he belives she had a part in, and we see Dolores's estranged daughter Selena return (Leigh).What follows are a series of flashbacks and real-time footage until we get the full picture of Dolores's relationship with employer Vera, why Selena left all those years ago and what really happened with her husband.  Never has cinematography been used to such a level of excellence as it is in the finale, which uses a stunning solar eclipse as its backdrop.  The dreary setting of the present is also contrasted with the brighter, more colourful photography used to show Selena's childhood.The performances all round as spot on, although its the three leading ladies that really give an impression.  Kathy Bates as the resilient Dolores gives a performance every bit as good as she did in 'Misery', Jennifer Jason Leigh's just-about-to-crack Selena is utterly compelling and Judy Parfit (who other than this I've only seen playing Lizzie's mother in 'ER') as the snobbish rich woman is especially brilliant as the audience watches her gradually decay.  More importantly, this doesn't go down the road of a feminist drama.  Although admitedly there are feminist aspects to the movie, its the jealousy, self-loathing and hopelessness that really drives these women.

She was once an award winning writer, but now it looks like she may lose her job and she can't seem able to get through the day without a drink. To make matters worse, her mother, Dolores Claiborne, has just been arrested for murder. The strange thing is that it's not the first time Dolores Claiborne has been accused of killing someone. Selena is forced to return home. However, it's not for a happy family reunion because these two women have dark secrets that they both are trying to forget...Dolores Claiborne is one of those films that men just don't get (which is ironic since the novel and the screenplay were both written by men). I can understand why men get somewhat agitated when watching Dolores as in this story they are definitely the villains. At their best, they are just guilty of adultery, but at their worst, they are violent child molesters. In fact, you almost get the impression that John C.

Quite a lot of this film is predictable as a bowl of Wheaties; neck-breaking suspense comes from wondering if these people will ever figure themselves out. Will Dolores realize her daughter is angry because she simply doesn't remember that her father molested her?-- oh, now I've gone and given away the rest of the plot. Well nevermind. Will Selena realize that psychiatrists are like gods-- the fewer the better? This film is so like having coffee with a dear friend.Altogether, you need to see this film. Kathy Bates is so good, I'm mailed her an oat bran muffin, a bottle of vitamins, and a nice warm scarf. I want her happy and healthy, and making films for many years to come. She plays Dolores at two different ages, and yeah, she wears a little face make-up, and some hair-grey, but it's all barely necessarily, because she uses her body to tell us what time it is. We see Dolores sustain a back injury, and the Dolores everafter turns her whole body, and her neck only a little to look sideways; the young, uninjured Dolores turns from the waist with full neck movement. Details like this make you want to go back to the videostore and tell the salesclerk she undercharged you. Julia Roberts and Leonardo DiCaprio do not think of things like this. Oh, and she's got a character voice too. I was giggling and clapping my hands in joy like a damm Britney Spears fan.Jennifer Jason Leigh isn't of the same calibre as Kathy Bates, but she's still darned good, and at least she's willing to play unattractive characters, and play them to the hilt. She's a perfect foil for Bates, because she forces the audience to appreciate the depth of Dolores' maternal feelings; Selena is plain nasty, so Dolores is certainly not making sacrifices because Selena has such a delightful personality, or treats her with such respect.Even if you don't watch the film, buy it, and buy it new; let filmmakers know that a film without a car chase or a woman in a halter-top still sells.

The reunion of the two causes both to reexamine past traumas that possibly should have been faced and expurgated ages ago, and as these painful memories are brought to the surface, things are never quite the same between the two -- especially for Selena, who seemed to have forgotten -- and/or wished she had forgotten certain experiences, which have caused her to become a somewhat closed-off, pill-popping woman who clearly seemed to have been suffering from some underlying psychologial issues.While Delores is being accused of the current murder of her employer, a detective played by Christopher Plummer takes the case, and doggedly harasses Dolores, as he stubbornly adheres to the everlasting belief that she also murdered her husband in the past.While based on a Stephen King novel, I'm strongly hesitant to tag this movie a horror flick as many others do in other places. Instead, I call this a mystery/suspense/drama. The dialogue is fairly complex, as many layers are uncovered regarding the psychological natures of Delores, Selena and other characters. As the scenes, dialogue and time progress, more and more things seem to unravel, up until the very end, when two disturbingly primal events are uncovered: one regarding Delores, and the other regarding Selena. From there, the story takes an unpredictable twist (which I will not reveal), but it's quite revelatory in how it all connects.Kathy Bates shines here as the foul-mouthed, spunky woman who bears the least amount of shame with her personality, and it doesn't seem like much of a stretch for Kathy herself. Jennifer Jason Leigh excellently and convincingly portrays the beautiful, intriguing, yet troubled and vulnerable Selena. The scenes which take place in New England (as to be expected from S. King), maintain an atmospheric presence throughout the movie, as the events of the present feature landscapes shot in a beautifully melancholic, fog-like, autumnal blue shade, while the past events feature landscapes shot in a burnt orange color, which can only be comparable to that of a mid-autumn leaf. Pretty ironic, but it works quite well. Both aspects of this technique add an extra amount of depth and sincerity to the story. Also worth noting are what seem like New England accents, used by Kathy Bates (and selected others), which help to give the characters a homebred authenticity.A film that possibly deserves more credit than it gets. Excellent story, excellent acting, excellent atmospherics and excellently written, I don't think I can name many (if any) flaws in this film. I highly enjoy this film.

Kathy Bates was absolutely the best actress that could have been casted for this role.  I have never been a big fan of Bates, but my opinion has been renewed now that I have seen her performance as Dolores Claiborne.  Jennifer James is astounding as the supporting actress.  This is definately not a feel good movie, I was on the edge of my seat and completely disguisted at some scenes, but that tells me that the actors in this movie are profound.  For a two-hour movie, I don't think I looked away once, aside from the scene with the abusive dad and the little girl on the ferry I could not stomach that.  Kathy Bates is convincing in 100% of her scenes, she does not skip a beat. Not one.  I agree with all the other reviewers, this movie should have recieved multiple Oscars- Best Music Score, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Motion Picture for 1995.

Therefore I may not have the same view on this film, as those of you who have.Dolores Claiborne, as a  movie, is surprisingly well made. I have no doubt that this is Taylor  Hackford's best film yet. I am especially impressed with the visual effects  he used, during the flashbacks. He paints a vivid picture of the world of  Dolores Claiborne: A world of sorrow and pain. He pulls the audience into  this world and never lets go. Thus, he brings us through Dolores'life and  make us feel her pain.Another great thing about this film, is the  acting. Kathy Bate's is as usual brilliant. CAN she even mess up a single  line?  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays as she is supposed to;nothing more,  nothing less. Which in itself should be considered a superb performance.  And I was also really pleased by the remarkable performance of Judy  Parfitt, the actress who plays Vera. Truly a great portrayl of a women who  is as hurt and angry as Dolores. The scene in which she reveals her  deepest, darkest secret to Dolores (you who have seen the film will know  what I am talking about) is truly one of the best scenes from a movie the  last 20 years! She should have gotten an Oscar! Plummer, as detective  Mackey is also extremely  good. Especially in the finale of the film.  Very intense!However, I feel there is one element of this film that so  far has been largely overlooked by the other reviewers: Danny Elfman's  superb score. Indeed, this score should be considered one of the finest  EVER. Right up there with Herrmann's PSYCHO and Steiner's KING KONG. And I  seriously mean that.  Elfman's music is, perhaps more than any other  element of the film, that which creates the painfull, sadly mysterious  atmosphere of this movie. He uses an orchestra largely consistning of  strings with added piano etc. and hereby creates a cold, stark sound which  is as harsh as our lead character. Yet, he also gives us a score filled  with emotion and pain, a score which makes the audience (whether consiously  or subconsiously) more involved in the story and makes us feel closely  connected to the characters. He creates a tention, that to this day has  never been mached in any other score before or since.Still, Dolores  Claiborne is not perfect (Which film is?). The script could have been  fairly better penned, especially the inquest scene where Dolores is being  questioned.But overall, this is a finely crated film, which has a lot to  offer in the visual department, the acting and especially the score.

31327,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0780622383,S. Schell,"[3, 4]","Setting the tone for Stephen King's first-person narrative of murder and suspense, &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; begins with the title character's  integrity becoming questionable as she holds a rolling pin high above her  head at the foot of a banister, ready to strike. At her feet bloody and  broken lies Vera Donovan, the mistress of the house and her employer of  over 20 years. She is on the brink of death and holds Dolores' perturbed  gaze, pleading with her as the neighborhood mailman walks in the house with  a satchel full of envelopes and, along with the audience, makes the  horrible assumption that Dolores has just committed a vile and immoral act.  From this abrupt and climactic scene, a visual and psychological  masterpiece blooms from the unique and aesthetic interpretation of a  fledgling director, giving King's quirky but engaging yarn about a  tough-as-nails New Englander an authentic and absorbing  effervescence.When King began penning his tale of a hard-luck Maine  woman with a dark past, his mind was on Kathy Bates, the actress who  delivered a disconcerting representation of an obsessive fan in 1990's  horror hit &quot;Misery&quot;. Her volatile and freakish performance  merited her an Oscar for Best Actress, gaining King's favor and securing  another spotlight role for her in his next adaptation. She has proven  herself to be a theatrical powerhouse once more as the austere and brazen  Dolores, a woman whose sympathetic spirit has stiffened from enduring  countless catastrophes in the course of her toilsome existence. Bates is a  formidable talent but her fellow cast members are impressive  notwithstanding. Jennifer Jason Leigh is straightforward and affecting as  Selena, Dolores' estranged and embittered daughter. She plays the skeptical  and begrudged bit effectively, adjoining savage and repressed emotion to  match her lank and pallid appearance. Christopher Plummer as the dogged  detective John Mackey is the perfect contrareity of courtly manner and  gritty resolve, his refined forte as an actor a befitting blend to this  generation's turnout of talented thespians. Last but not least, Judy  Parfitt makes the icy and callous Vera Donovan believably sympathetic,  bringing to light an understanding for her rigid nature as the audience  becomes acquainted with every character and Dolores' established pasts with  them. Vera may seem harsh, but she is nowhere in the bounds of being as  despicable as Joe, Dolores' abusive and alcoholic husband. David Strathairn  was surprisingly convincing as the contemptuous and simple-minded boozer,  an insecure and self-destructive man who finds his comfort in his stature  as a stone-hard wifebeater. Stephen King writes his characters well,  absorbing either his reader or his viewer into their worlds, and there are  powerful moments for each of them in this two-hour character study.Two  moments that strike me the most are, first and foremost, a prolonged frame  of the dilapidated house upon the island in the last winks of daylight as  the evening consumes the earth. A thick and cloudy crimson sky swallows the  dark and crumbling property that is singularly lit by an ominous, ghostly  blue light on the porch. If one were to pause the film at this exact  moment, they would feel as if they were looking at the eerie and  mesmerizing cover art intended for this very novel. Another is the  arresting moment when Selena recollects the enervating sexual abuse from  her father while riding upon the local ferry. She envisions herself and Joe  sitting upon a bench, Joe taking her numb hands and pulling them toward his  lap. Her brow is furrowed and she is whimpering with pain and resistance as  she casts her eyes down to the floor, fighting tears. When she looks back  up, she fixes her gaze this time directly to the camera and her face  smoothes to a neutral expression, blank and emotionless. You know at this  moment there is a complete detachment, one she has unwillingly mastered  throughout the years to cleverly disguise her burgeoning agony. Credit must  also be given to Taylor Hackford for the ingeniously devised method of  blending past and present with consistent and numerous flashbacks that take  place throughout the film. The dull and grayish palettes are literally  wiped over with full and vibrant technicolor memories that create a  comprehensive separation between the past and the here and now.King has  always been an incredible writer, but this is the first time that a film  has ever surpassed the novel that birthed it. Leave it to Kathy Bates to  steal the prize, but it is a welcome theft for the justice she gave to  &quot;Misery&quot;. &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; is a screenplay well  orchestrated and brilliantly directed, the sparkling gem in the entire  library of Stephen King films.",5,"Mediocre Novel, Marvelous Film",967248000,"08 26, 2000",2000,4830,"['Setting', 'tone', 'Stephen', 'King', 'first-person', 'narrative', 'murder', 'suspense', 'quot', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'quot', 'title', 'character', 'integrity', 'becoming', 'questionable', 'rolling', 'pin', 'high', 'head', 'foot', 'banister', 'ready', 'strike', 'feet', 'bloody', 'broken', 'lies', 'Vera', 'Donovan', 'mistress', 'house', 'employer', '20', 'years', 'brink', 'death', 'Dolores', 'perturbed', 'gaze', 'pleading', 'neighborhood', 'mailman', 'walks', 'house', 'satchel', 'full', 'envelopes', 'audience', 'horrible', 'assumption', 'just', 'committed', 'vile', 'immoral', 'act', 'abrupt', 'climactic', 'scene', 'visual', 'psychological', 'masterpiece', 'blooms', 'unique', 'aesthetic', 'interpretation', 'fledgling', 'director', 'giving', 'King', 'quirky', 'engaging', 'tough-as-nails', 'New', 'Englander', 'authentic', 'absorbing', 'effervescence.When', 'King', 'began', 'penning', 'tale', 'hard-luck', 'Maine', 'woman', 'dark', 'past', 'mind', 'was', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'actress', 'who', 'delivered', 'disconcerting', 'representation', 'obsessive', 'fan', '1990', 'horror', 'hit', 'quot', 'Misery', 'quot', 'volatile', 'freakish', 'performance', 'merited', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'gaining', 'King', 'favor', 'securing', 'spotlight', 'role', 'next', 'adaptation', 'proven', 'be', 'theatrical', 'powerhouse', 'once', 'more', 'austere', 'brazen', 'Dolores', 'woman', 'sympathetic', 'spirit', 'stiffened', 'enduring', 'countless', 'catastrophes', 'course', 'toilsome', 'existence', 'Bates', 'formidable', 'talent', 'fellow', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'impressive', 'notwithstanding', 'Jennifer', 'Jason', 'Leigh', 'straightforward', 'affecting', 'Selena', 'Dolores', 'estranged', 'embittered', 'daughter', 'skeptical', 'begrudged', 'bit', 'effectively', 'adjoining', 'savage', 'repressed', 'emotion', 'match', 'lank', 'pallid', 'appearance', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'dogged', 'detective', 'John', 'Mackey', 'perfect', 'contrareity', 'courtly', 'manner', 'gritty', 'resolve', 'refined', 'forte', 'actor', 'befitting', 'blend', 'generation', 'turnout', 'talented', 'thespians', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'Judy', 'Parfitt', 'icy', 'callous', 'Vera', 'Donovan', 'believably', 'sympathetic', 'bringing', 'light', 'understanding', 'rigid', 'nature', 'audience', 'acquainted', 'character', 'Dolores', 'established', 'pasts', 'Vera', 'may', 'seem', 'harsh', 'nowhere', 'bounds', 'being', 'as', 'despicable', 'Joe', 'Dolores', 'abusive', 'alcoholic', 'husband', 'David', 'Strathairn', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'convincing', 'contemptuous', 'simple-minded', 'boozer', 'insecure', 'self-destructive', 'man', 'who', 'comfort', 'stature', 'stone-hard', 'wifebeater', 'Stephen', 'King', 'characters', 'well', 'absorbing', 'reader', 'viewer', 'worlds', 'are', 'powerful', 'moments', 'two-hour', 'character', 'study.Two', 'moments', 'strike', 'most', 'are', 'first', 'foremost', 'prolonged', 'frame', 'dilapidated', 'house', 'island', 'last', 'winks', 'daylight', 'evening', 'earth', 'thick', 'cloudy', 'crimson', 'sky', 'dark', 'crumbling', 'property', 'singularly', 'lit', 'ominous', 'ghostly', 'blue', 'light', 'porch', 'one', 'were', 'pause', 'film', 'exact', 'moment', 'would', 'feel', 'were', 'looking', 'eerie', 'mesmerizing', 'cover', 'art', 'intended', 'very', 'novel', 'arresting', 'moment', 'when', 'Selena', 'enervating', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'father', 'riding', 'local', 'ferry', 'Joe', 'sitting', 'bench', 'Joe', 'taking', 'numb', 'hands', 'pulling', 'lap', 'brow', 'furrowed', 'whimpering', 'pain', 'resistance', 'eyes', 'down', 'floor', 'fighting', 'tears', 'When', 'back', 'up', 'fixes', 'gaze', 'time', 'directly', 'camera', 'face', 'smoothes', 'neutral', 'expression', 'blank', 'emotionless', 'know', 'moment', 'complete', 'detachment', 'one', 'unwillingly', 'mastered', 'years', 'cleverly', 'disguise', 'burgeoning', 'agony', 'Credit', 'must', 'also', 'be', 'given', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'ingeniously', 'devised', 'method', 'blending', 'past', 'present', 'consistent', 'numerous', 'flashbacks', 'take', 'place', 'film', 'dull', 'grayish', 'palettes', 'are', 'literally', 'wiped', 'full', 'vibrant', 'technicolor', 'memories', 'create', 'comprehensive', 'separation', 'past', 'here', 'now.King', 'always', 'been', 'incredible', 'writer', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'ever', 'surpassed', 'novel', 'birthed', 'Leave', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'steal', 'prize', 'welcome', 'theft', 'justice', 'gave', 'quot', 'Misery', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dolores', 'Claiborne', 'quot', 'screenplay', 'well', 'orchestrated', 'brilliantly', 'directed', 'sparkling', 'gem', 'entire', 'library', 'Stephen', 'King', 'films']",Dolores Claiborne VHS

It has a story, not just a plot, to tell. The characters tell it well. And perhaps these characters might seem too tough or ""darth vadar like"" for some, but I enjoyed them--do what you have to do and don't whine. I like that. But it was just a climax or a a turning point that kept you interested . . . there were several . . . no not in a manipulative way . . . just the way the one story unfolded itself. It was great. Unique. However, whether Stephen King or the person who wrote the screen adaptation (was it King, himself??? dunno), someone couldn't resist interjecting some politics in a few highlighted spots. I am not a fan of victim complexes and while I understand why there was a women's movement, hating men and thinking it is woman vs man is a huge turn off for one and kinda borders victim hood, when these characters are anything but victims.

The money in which Dolores saves is for her daughter's college fund.The film is mainly about three woman, Dolores, her daughter Selena, and Vera, and the intangled lives they lead, along with their secrets and lies that eventually come out. Taylor Hackford, who directed the movie, wanted to make a ""woman's picture"" and he succeeded. Although the main character in the film is Dolores, we soon see how her life is intermingled with that of her child and employer. The bulk of the film concerns the death of Dolores' husband and the mystery surrounding that death.The performances in this blockbuster are the best that a movie can attain. Kathy is outstanding, Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays the adult Selena is mesmerizing, and Judy Parfitt, who plays Vera, steals the movie with her bitchy and autocratic sense of timing. Christopher Plummer plays a supporting role as a police detective on the island.The DVD features one of the best audio commentaries of a movie I have ever heard; it is by Taylor Hackford and he offers some interesting tidbits and info on the making of the film.

Risoli ""black farmer""","[0, 6]","""Dolores Claiborne"" was the 1995 film version of the Stephen King novel of the same name that was considerable effort from director Taylor Hackford.  The performance by Kathy Bates was solid.  Jennifer Jason Leigh provided a very embittered character that we in final glimpses came to understand somewhat, which I think was too fleeting and Miss Jason Leigh should have been allowed to show more warmth as she seemed in the strange telling of the story somewhat overly dramatic.  Christopher Plummer has been better, certainly not giving a career defining performance as Bates very well could have.  I think Bates's performance could have been equal to her ""Misery"" character in another Stephen King movie.  Tony Gilroy's screenplay could have corrected these inaccuracies in achievement, but then his screenplay apparently may be based on an official Stephen King work, but fails to rise to the level of Hitchcock.  Hitchcock never lived down his mistake, that Gilroy bases his whole structure of the tale around, that could never be forgiven him in his 50 film career beyond ""Stage Fright"" in 1950 when he told a lie in a flashback.  This film cheats on this flaw to a major degree and thereby takes down an otherwise good film.  It is not a problem with Stephen King as the filmmakers could very well have told this tale without this ineptitude despite if one likes King or not.
