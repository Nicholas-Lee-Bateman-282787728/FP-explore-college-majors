994180,A34JAXR0W215IP,B000FQISSU,Das Book,"[2, 2]","I had no idea so many of this show's fans were adults.  Now I don't feel so silly for watching it!  Woohoo!The premise of Code Lyoko is fairly simple.  Lyoko is a ""virtual world"" that exists inside a computer; while the scenes that take place in the real world are animated traditionally, the battle scenes on Lyoko are animated using CGI.  The computer also houses XANA, an evil entity that wants to take over the world, which he attempts to do using control towers on Lyoko that allow him to act outside the computer, for instance, by seizing control of government weapons sattelites.  The Lyoko team, a group of young teens who attend the boarding school near the abandoned factory that houses the supercomputer, are the only humans who know of its existence, and they have to find a way to defeat XANA while maintaining their dual lives as ordinary junior high school kids.The show has its flaws, of course; I don't think there's any such thing as a ""perfect"" TV show, movie, or anything else.  For instance, it becomes obvious fairly quickly that the animators often just reuse bits from previous episodes, which creates the occasional continuity error.  It should also be noted that the English dub occasionally flatly ignores the show's French origins; for example, the characters refer to dollars rather than Euros, and even worse, at one point a character mentions the school having begun a ""language exchange program""--no idea what that is--with France, despite the fact that they already live there.  (In fact, one episode even reveals the school's location via satellite image.  Hard to ignore that...)  These are pretty few and far between, though, and therefore only of consequence to dweebs like me that notice everything.That being said, Code Lyoko is still pretty darn entertaining, full of humor, action, and even romance.  Plus, there's virtually nothing that's even remotely obscene or offensive about this show, which makes it perfect for family viewing.  (Hey, kids watch Code Lyoko too!  Surprise surprise!)  There's also a clear message of cooperation and trust that binds the series together; the series is set at a boarding school, with students who come from literally every corner of the globe, but the culture of the school is such that the racial and societal differences between them are hardly given a second thought, and occasionally even the main cast's bitter rivals will step in to lend a hand.The only real flaw as far as the show itself, especially in the first season, is that it relies a little too heavily on the ""deus ex machina"" conceit; any problems that the kids or XANA cause can easily be deleted by travelling back in time.  Also, certain plot holes tend to go unexplained, such as why the abandoned factory was never torn down.  (In fairness, though, the time-travel concept was largely disposed of in later seasons, maybe because the creators realized that their audience was a little more savvy than they'd anticipated.)Unfortunately, the most glaring flaw with this DVD set is the DVD set itself.  The episodes are thrown together in random order--not a problem for most of the season, but the last few episodes follow a definite arc that's incompatible with out-of-order viewing--and there are far too few extras.  The only audio track, for instance, is the English dub; since this set is sold in Canada as well, I would have thought that including the original French language track would have been an obvious choice, but apparently I'd be wrong.  The saving grace, in fact, is the price tag, far lower than what you'd expect to pay for a full season of just about any other show.All in all, I wish there were a better place to start if you're new to Code Lyoko; but to be honest, it could be a lot worse.  Of course, I should warn the new viewer that Funimation seems to be taking its time releasing Season 2, if indeed it ever will at all--the second volume of season 2 isn't even mentioned on the Funimation Web site anymore--so you may want to think twice about getting involved if you haven't been keeping up with the TV broadcast.",4,Wow!,1189900800,"09 16, 2007",2007,4090,"['had', 'idea', 'so', 'many', 'show', 'fans', 'were', 'adults', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'so', 'silly', 'watching', 'Woohoo', 'premise', 'Code', 'Lyoko', 'fairly', 'simple', 'Lyoko', 'virtual', 'world', 'inside', 'computer', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'animated', 'traditionally', 'battle', 'scenes', 'Lyoko', 'are', 'animated', 'using', 'CGI', 'computer', 'also', 'houses', 'XANA', 'evil', 'entity', 'take', 'over', 'world', 'do', 'using', 'control', 'towers', 'Lyoko', 'allow', 'act', 'computer', 'instance', 'seizing', 'control', 'government', 'weapons', 'sattelites', 'Lyoko', 'team', 'group', 'young', 'teens', 'who', 'attend', 'boarding', 'school', 'abandoned', 'factory', 'houses', 'supercomputer', 'are', 'only', 'humans', 'who', 'know', 'existence', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'defeat', 'XANA', 'maintaining', 'dual', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'kids.The', 'show', 'flaws', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'such', 'thing', 'perfect', 'TV', 'show', 'movie', 'anything', 'else', 'instance', 'obvious', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'animators', 'often', 'just', 'reuse', 'bits', 'previous', 'episodes', 'occasional', 'continuity', 'error', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'noted', 'English', 'dub', 'occasionally', 'flatly', 'show', 'French', 'origins', 'example', 'characters', 'refer', 'dollars', 'rather', 'Euros', 'even', 'worse', 'one', 'point', 'character', 'school', 'having', 'begun', 'language', 'exchange', 'program', 'idea', 'what', 'France', 'fact', 'already', 'live', 'there', 'fact', 'one', 'episode', 'even', 'school', 'location', 'satellite', 'image', 'Hard', 'ignore', 'are', 'pretty', 'few', 'far', 'therefore', 'only', 'consequence', 'dweebs', 'notice', 'being', 'said', 'Code', 'Lyoko', 'still', 'pretty', 'darn', 'entertaining', 'full', 'humor', 'action', 'even', 'romance', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'even', 'remotely', 'obscene', 'offensive', 'show', 'perfect', 'family', 'viewing', 'Hey', 'kids', 'watch', 'Code', 'Lyoko', 'too', 'Surprise', 'surprise', 'also', 'clear', 'message', 'cooperation', 'trust', 'series', 'together', 'series', 'set', 'boarding', 'school', 'students', 'who', 'come', 'literally', 'corner', 'globe', 'culture', 'school', 'such', 'racial', 'societal', 'differences', 'are', 'hardly', 'given', 'second', 'thought', 'occasionally', 'even', 'main', 'cast', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'will', 'step', 'lend', 'hand.The', 'only', 'real', 'flaw', 'as', 'far', 'show', 'especially', 'first', 'season', 'little', 'too', 'heavily', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'conceit', 'problems', 'kids', 'XANA', 'cause', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'deleted', 'travelling', 'back', 'time', 'Also', 'certain', 'plot', 'holes', 'tend', 'go', 'unexplained', 'such', 'why', 'abandoned', 'factory', 'was', 'never', 'torn', 'down', 'fairness', 'though', 'time-travel', 'concept', 'was', 'largely', 'disposed', 'later', 'seasons', 'maybe', 'creators', 'realized', 'audience', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'savvy', ""'d"", 'anticipated', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'glaring', 'flaw', 'DVD', 'set', 'DVD', 'set', 'episodes', 'are', 'thrown', 'together', 'random', 'order', 'not', 'problem', 'most', 'season', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'follow', 'definite', 'arc', 'incompatible', 'out-of-order', 'viewing', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'few', 'extras', 'only', 'audio', 'track', 'instance', 'English', 'dub', 'set', 'sold', 'Canada', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'including', 'original', 'French', 'language', 'track', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'obvious', 'choice', 'apparently', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'saving', 'grace', 'fact', 'price', 'tag', 'far', 'lower', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'pay', 'full', 'season', 'just', 'other', 'show.All', 'wish', 'were', 'better', 'place', 'start', ""'re"", 'new', 'Code', 'Lyoko', 'be', 'honest', 'could', 'be', 'lot', 'worse', 'course', 'should', 'warn', 'new', 'viewer', 'Funimation', 'be', 'taking', 'time', 'releasing', 'Season', '2', 'indeed', 'ever', 'will', 'second', 'volume', 'season', '2', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'Funimation', 'Web', 'site', 'anymore', 'may', 'want', 'think', 'twice', 'getting', 'involved', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'keeping', 'up', 'TV', 'broadcast']",Code Lyoko: First Season
