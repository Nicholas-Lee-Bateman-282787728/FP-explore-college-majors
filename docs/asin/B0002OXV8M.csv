[Those involved, years later, said he was so high-strung they shot him just hours or a day or two after he was stolen because they couldn't handle him.  Since Shergar was owned by the Aga Khan, worth about $4-5 billion at the time, ransom was immediately ruled out.]  With this in mind, this movie should be watched, not as a docudrama but as fiction, with only the horse's name and kidnapping being factual.Both my wife and I were fully captivated by the story until the unexpected ending.  As with most movies, there are a few ""holes"" in the story, but not enough to detract from the adventure and suspense.  We enjoyed the movie (and we own more than a thousand DVD movies related to kids and teens).

A well-drilled IRA contingent led by Gavin O'Rourke (Mickey Rourke) makes off with the horse and hides him on the farm of the reluctant Garrity (David Warner), trading upon his family's connections to the provisionals.  What they don't know is that Garrity has a stableboy sleeping in his loft.  Kevin (Tom Walsh) is a fugitive from a juvenile detention facility who never met his father but knows the man was a jockey and dreams of being one himself.  He quickly bonds with the concealed stallion, and when O'Rourke's attempts to extort a ransom from the animal's owners are rebuffed and the horse is threatened with death, Kevin knows he can't allow it.  He takes off across the Irish countryside in a wild race for sanctuary, unable to surrender to the authorities for fear he'll be returned to prison, knowing only that he must save Shergar.  On the way he falls in with a tinker named Joseph Maguire (Ian Holm) and his granddaughter Kate (Laura Murphy) and has his chance to ride Shergar in a country race before tragedy strikes.Beautiful scenery and a fine scoreSHERGAR (CD) John Scottadd to the appeal of this movie, and while Shergar's supposed fate is expectedly sad (Ireland's an island, after all--what chance does Kevin have of eluding the IRA forever?), the tag scene offers a ray of happiness for both Kevin and the bloodline.

The film flips back and forth between overly-sentimental and down to earth. A combination of many of the cinematic elements lack cohesion, a real shame.Shergar touts Mickey Rourke as one of the cast. He plays the leader of an ultra violent splinter group of the I.R.A., and the mastermind of a prize horse kidnapping. He looked like he had suffered a plastic surgery botch job, and carted his tanning booth along during the filming of Shergar. To say the least, he was not a believable character.The other major downside of this film was the awful music which distracted from the film with a loud audio overlay sinking an otherwise okay film.Don't get me wrong, there are good points to this DVD. Ian Holmes, a very good actor,  lights up his character with good cheer, and poetry. Once the boy escapes with the doomed horse, the story becomes interesting. Beautiful landscape and a great ""tinker"" character fill the second half of this film. There are some lovely scenes in the Irish countryside, and at a horse race held in Co. Clare.
