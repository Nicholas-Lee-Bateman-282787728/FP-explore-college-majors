I don't normally watch made for TV films, but this one is a special exception. Hank Azaria plays Mitch Albom, a sportswriter who learns his favorite college professor, Morrie, played by the late Jack Lemmon, is dying. Mitch feels awful because he said he would keep in touch with Morrie after college, but never did. Mitch decides to keep his promise and to finally go see his dying teacher. Morrie recommends that the two start to see each other every tuesday. Mitch records their visits to get Morrie's view of things on tape. This is a very good movie. What makes this movie is that it's real. This is true. The two stars give incredible performances. It is sad and heartbreaking that Mr. Lemmon is no longer with us. legends with grace, class, and style, are a dime a dozen these days. He gives one of his best performances here ever.

Not to belittle the extraordinary talents of Mr. Lemmon and Mr. Azaria, but  the filmmakers really blew it. Using flashbacks to illustrate as Morrie  (Lemmon) talks about his childhood will seem pointless to anyone who has  seen the film &quot;Short Cuts&quot;--in which Mr. Lemmon delivers an  entire terrific monologue without visual aids. Another problem is the whole  relationship subplot (not in the book), not to mention Mitch's  sportswriting &quot;adventures&quot;. An interesting aspect of the book,  only briefly touched on here, is America's obsession with the O.J. trial,  which was in full swing at the time of the real Morrie's demise.I thought  the book was great.

He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that.I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry.My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other.

It is hard to watch as Morrie Schwartz (Jack Lemon) is dying of Lou Gehrig's Disease and slowly but surely loses use of his body.  His spirit is strong and he has decided to learn something from each moment left.  Mitch Albom (Hank Azaria)  sees his old professor on TV by chance.  He is giving an interview to Ted Kopple of ABC's Nightline.  Mitch is a busy man, but feels a tug to visit Morrie before he dies.  Despite his job as high powered sports reporter, Mitch decides to take a few hours and reconnect with his mentor.  Morrie is ecstatic that he came to see him, he reminded Mitch he promised to keep in touch but is just glad he came.The meeting turns into a scheduled time to talk to Morrie on Tuesdays, and record his dying words.  His inspirational thoughts on life transform Mitch's view on what is important.So, two stories emerge, 1) facing and understanding the steady progression of  disease and dying  and 2) how to savor every minute of life as if every day is your last day.  Mitch learns from Morrie all over again.  He learns not to be afraid of marriage, aging, family, touching and caring.  The human spirit is based on simple truths that all humans face in life.  Mitch might be a successful sports columnist and television  host, but he has lost how to enjoy life and who is important.Morrie embraces each day and although he has become as dependent as a baby, he frames his final days as full of love and being taken care of like a small child.  The movie is bittersweet and has a thoughtful message.",3,Close-Up on Dying and Life's Priorities,1286064000,"10 3, 2010",2010,1615,"['Tuesdays', 'Morrie', 'film', 'death', 'dying', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'hard', 'watch', 'Morrie', 'Schwartz', 'Jack', 'Lemon', 'dying', 'Lou', 'Gehrig', 'Disease', 'slowly', 'surely', 'use', 'body', 'spirit', 'strong', 'decided', 'learn', 'something', 'moment', 'left', 'Mitch', 'Albom', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'old', 'professor', 'TV', 'chance', 'giving', 'interview', 'Ted', 'Kopple', 'ABC', 'Nightline', 'Mitch', 'busy', 'man', 'tug', 'visit', 'Morrie', 'job', 'high', 'powered', 'sports', 'reporter', 'Mitch', 'take', 'few', 'hours', 'reconnect', 'mentor', 'Morrie', 'ecstatic', 'came', 'see', 'reminded', 'Mitch', 'promised', 'keep', 'touch', 'just', 'glad', 'meeting', 'scheduled', 'time', 'talk', 'Morrie', 'Tuesdays', 'record', 'dying', 'words', 'inspirational', 'thoughts', 'life', 'transform', 'Mitch', 'view', 'what', 'important.So', 'two', 'stories', 'emerge', '1', 'facing', 'understanding', 'steady', 'progression', 'disease', 'dying', '2', 'how', 'savor', 'minute', 'life', 'day', 'last', 'day', 'Mitch', 'Morrie', 'over', 'again', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'marriage', 'aging', 'family', 'touching', 'caring', 'human', 'spirit', 'based', 'simple', 'truths', 'humans', 'face', 'life', 'Mitch', 'might', 'be', 'successful', 'sports', 'columnist', 'television', 'host', 'lost', 'how', 'enjoy', 'life', 'who', 'important.Morrie', 'embraces', 'day', 'become', 'as', 'dependent', 'baby', 'final', 'days', 'full', 'love', 'being', 'taken', 'care', 'small', 'child', 'movie', 'bittersweet', 'thoughtful', 'message']",Tuesday's With Morrie VHS

Played to perfection by Jack Lemmon, poignantly in his last screen role, Morrie is a retired University professor who wants to use his death to teach others how to live. Reunited with his fast-living former student, Mitch Albom, we see how his words and aphorisms turn Mitch from a nice but career-driven guy into someone more rounded and at peace with himself. Since the film is based on a true story - Mitch and Morrie are both real - it gives an added import to Morrie's words. The movie works due to its subtlety and its refusal to play-down the devastating effects of ALS. It also doesn't put Morrie on a pedestal; he has his dark moments and this makes his words more convincing. To know that he battles the same demons that we all do makes him less like a guru and more human. Although the film does carry a lot of wisdom, it never tries to preach. Mitch finds the lessons difficult and provides the sort of questions we might all have when faced with such statements as `We must love one another or die'. Ultimately, you feel Morrie succeeded in his wish to make his death a lesson in living and we must thank Mitch Albrom and the makers of this film, for bringing his words to us all.",5,"A moving story of life, death, and love",1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,1311,"['may', 'think', 'movie', 'death', 'man', 'ALS', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'going', 'Morrie', 'ordinary', 'man', 'Played', 'perfection', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'poignantly', 'last', 'screen', 'role', 'Morrie', 'retired', 'University', 'professor', 'who', 'use', 'death', 'teach', 'others', 'how', 'live', 'Reunited', 'fast-living', 'former', 'student', 'Mitch', 'Albom', 'see', 'how', 'words', 'aphorisms', 'turn', 'Mitch', 'nice', 'career-driven', 'guy', 'someone', 'more', 'rounded', 'peace', 'film', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'Mitch', 'Morrie', 'are', 'real', 'added', 'import', 'Morrie', 'words', 'movie', 'due', 'subtlety', 'refusal', 'play-down', 'devastating', 'effects', 'ALS', 'also', ""n't"", 'put', 'Morrie', 'pedestal', 'dark', 'moments', 'words', 'more', 'convincing', 'know', 'same', 'demons', 'do', 'less', 'guru', 'more', 'human', 'film', 'carry', 'lot', 'wisdom', 'never', 'preach', 'Mitch', 'lessons', 'difficult', 'sort', 'questions', 'might', 'have', 'when', 'faced', 'such', 'statements', 'must', 'love', 'one', 'die', 'Ultimately', 'feel', 'Morrie', 'succeeded', 'wish', 'make', 'death', 'lesson', 'living', 'must', 'thank', 'Mitch', 'Albrom', 'makers', 'film', 'bringing', 'words']",Tuesday's With Morrie VHS
