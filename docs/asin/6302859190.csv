340897,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6302859190,A. Estes,"[3, 5]","Apparently it's not a good idea to sit in the nosebleed section of a church; black contact lenses lend evil powers to anyone who wears them; you should never climb under your house in search of your kitty, especially if evil-looking children are lurking about. These are just some of a few lessons to be taken from the sequel nobody expected that snowballed into the franchise nobody wanted, ""Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice.""Picking up after the events of the firstfilm, a tabloid-journalist and his teenage son are passing through a small neighboring town of Gatlin, Nebraska shortly after those corn-husking little munchkins laid it to waste. Looking for his big break, the father/journalist decides to stay in town for a while. After merely a few days in town, he receives his fair-share of white-man's guilt from the resident Native America, uncovers a moldy corn conspiracy (a plot point which goes virtually nowhere) and plows the field of a innkeeper. Meanwhile, his son attempts to sow some seeds of his own with the girl-next-door who appears to the only one under the age of 18 in town who isn't under the trance of the mysterious maze.It must be said that by no means is ""Children of the Corn II"" a particularly great film. Like the first, it's pretty basic and predictable. It seems as if the script for the first film was tweaked just slightly to concoct a sequel and it shows with plot-holes the size of Nebraska (see what I did there?). Director David Price -- whose resume is as equally unimpressive as the film's script -- loves to inject a lot of ridiculous gore into the film, but forsakes logic in doing so. You'll see corn husks slashing throats, a nosebleed that somehow turns into an earache and a house falling on a woman who doesn't seem to understand she can either try crawling out or hide in between the beams. Nevermind that, though. You don't come here for logic, and Price knows that. With his made-for-TV movie cinematography, you can be rest assured you'll know exactly what you're getting into within the first five minutes of the film.But what about the cast? Kudos must go out to Ryan Bollman who does his best to look as menacing as possible as the leader of the kiddy cult. Someone ground that kid! On the other side of the coin, you have Terence Knox, resembling what would happen if Bill Pullman and Alec Baldwin gave birth to a bloated baby. Knox seems to be apathetic about the whole thing, as best evidenced by his reaction to the death of a friend by the end of the film. He steps it up a notch when he is caught sinning rather vigorously by his son, but this scene is so uninteresting, you'll feel the same sort of apathy toward it as the actor does the film. I guess you just can't expect Academy Award material with these films, but would it hurt to have actors who care about more than cashing in their paychecks carrying a film?When all is said and done, in spite of its glaring flaws, ""Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice"" is easily the best sequel in the ""Children of the Corn"" series, but that's not saying much. When you consider the films that followed in its wake, it's almost a back-handed compliment. Then again, the first ""Children of the Corn"" wasn't ground-breaking cinema by any stretch of the imagination, so the fact that any sequel to it can deliver the most basic entertainment is a miracle in and of itself. To that end, ""The Final Sacrifice"" is a rather schlocky but suitable guilty-pleasure follow-up. If you've suffered through enough ""Amityvilles"" or ""Howlings"" then there is no reason you can't sit through this one as well.A DVD release is finally on the chopping block for April 12th, courtesy of Echo Bridge Entertainment.

The main menu has annoying music and just the two films and chapter selection. Nothing really speical at all. Anyways, I have over 1000 dvds and have no idea why full screen or wide screen matter. Wide screen has black bars but I see no difference. I know somemone is willing to explain this to me. Anyways, the picture quality is good but diffently not remastered.

340899,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302859190,Austin Somlo,"[0, 1]","Viewed: 7/12Rate: 27/12: The last three words in the title Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice, what is this final? Who is this final? And for what? Danny the silly leader proclaims that the world is watching them to perform the ritual sacrifice. Yet it's only like..ten of them. Does Danny know that there are over five billion people in the world, making them so trivial in comparison? After watching Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice for a bit while, it's pretty apparent to detect in the laziness of the material. No reporters around? No mass investigation whatsoever? Where are we now? Gatlin or Hemingford? I couldn't even tell. If there are carcasses around, they will smell around the radius, and nobody seems to notice. In fact, it doesn't matter since all I saw are corn stalks. It seems that the writers saw the original and decided to take words and ideas from it. Then, they just expanded it a little bit but recycled the rest. At least, they could have showed some nudity to salvage whatever the film had left to retain the audience. On other hand, speaking of the plot, if Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice was primarily a boy meets girl movie with Micah and Lacey, I'll be fine with it. But what I saw is rubbish, all the way to the end. The Indian dude is pretty useless and sure comes to death rather too easily. How about that old lady whose house was dropped on her? I don't recall a house being held above by a machine because they usually use concrete blocks or something similar. But to keep the machine running at all times? Ah, another question I have: what is the relationship between Angela and Danny? Did she really adopt him? And why? I seem to be at a loss about that. If Garrett, the national reporter, is snooping around for a story, is it so obvious? Just take pictures of the children staring at the house and the mark on the sidings of the house. Simple. But nooo...he procures aid from his son and asks the others simple questions in a state of disbelief. He doesn't even notice that Danny has the makings of a leader of the cult. I don't know how he is a reporter after all. If the children are adopted, they don't seem to be adopted. Are we in Gatlin anyway? I don't get it. It seems that ""sin"" is a real popular word of usage during the film. Oh yes, don't forget ""fornication"" either. And there is plenty of it during the film along with sin. So is ""corn."" Lots of it. Yeah, real smart of the cop to put the corn stalk to the pedal of that monster harvester and then leaves the scene, only to allow the two tied-up men to escape at the last second. Why does every film do this constantly? On the positive side, the acting is kind of better than the original. But the look on Danny's face while screaming the words to people defiling(?) the corn is a bit...overboard for me. Uh...why get out of the van in the middle of the twister? Stay in the van and wait it out, fools. All in all, Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice doesn't do enough to get a rating of `1' from me.",1,"Other Than Lacey and Angela the Fornicators, There Is Nothing Going for It.",1343347200,"07 27, 2012",2012,3049,"['Viewed', '7/12Rate', '27/12', 'last', 'three', 'words', 'title', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'what', 'final', 'Who', 'final', 'what', 'silly', 'leader', 'proclaims', 'world', 'watching', 'perform', 'ritual', 'sacrifice', 'only', 'like..ten', 'Danny', 'know', 'are', 'five', 'billion', 'people', 'world', 'making', 'so', 'trivial', 'comparison', 'watching', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'bit', 'pretty', 'apparent', 'detect', 'laziness', 'material', 'reporters', 'mass', 'investigation', 'whatsoever', 'Where', 'are', 'now', 'Gatlin', 'Hemingford', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'are', 'carcasses', 'will', 'smell', 'radius', 'nobody', 'notice', 'fact', ""n't"", 'matter', 'saw', 'are', 'corn', 'stalks', 'writers', 'saw', 'original', 'decided', 'take', 'words', 'ideas', 'Then', 'just', 'expanded', 'little', 'bit', 'recycled', 'rest', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'showed', 'nudity', 'salvage', 'whatever', 'film', 'had', 'left', 'retain', 'audience', 'other', 'hand', 'speaking', 'plot', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', 'was', 'primarily', 'boy', 'meets', 'girl', 'movie', 'Micah', 'Lacey', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine', 'what', 'saw', 'rubbish', 'way', 'end', 'Indian', 'dude', 'pretty', 'useless', 'sure', 'death', 'rather', 'too', 'easily', 'How', 'old', 'lady', 'house', 'was', 'dropped', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'house', 'being', 'held', 'machine', 'usually', 'use', 'concrete', 'blocks', 'something', 'similar', 'keep', 'machine', 'running', 'times', 'Ah', 'question', 'have', 'what', 'relationship', 'Angela', 'Danny', 'Did', 'really', 'adopt', 'why', 'seem', 'be', 'loss', 'Garrett', 'national', 'reporter', 'snooping', 'around', 'story', 'so', 'obvious', 'Just', 'take', 'pictures', 'children', 'staring', 'house', 'mark', 'sidings', 'house', 'Simple', 'nooo', 'aid', 'son', 'others', 'simple', 'questions', 'state', 'disbelief', ""n't"", 'even', 'notice', 'Danny', 'makings', 'leader', 'cult', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'reporter', 'children', 'are', 'adopted', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'adopted', 'Are', 'Gatlin', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'sin', 'real', 'popular', 'word', 'usage', 'film', 'Oh', 'yes', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'fornication', 'plenty', 'film', 'sin', 'So', 'corn', 'Lots', 'Yeah', 'real', 'smart', 'cop', 'put', 'corn', 'stalk', 'pedal', 'monster', 'harvester', 'then', 'scene', 'only', 'allow', 'two', 'tied-up', 'men', 'escape', 'last', 'second', 'Why', 'film', 'do', 'constantly', 'positive', 'side', 'acting', 'kind', 'better', 'original', 'look', 'Danny', 'face', 'screaming', 'words', 'people', 'defiling', 'corn', 'bit', 'overboard', 'why', 'get', 'van', 'middle', 'twister', 'Stay', 'van', 'wait', 'out', 'fools', 'Children', 'Corn', 'II', 'Final', 'Sacrifice', ""n't"", 'do', 'enough', 'get', 'rating', '1']",N/A

The orphaned children are being taken to the next town over, Hemingford, to be taken care of while things get sorted out. And it's not long before He Who Walks Behind the Rows finds another child, Micah, to reform the corn cult and begin the murderous process all over again.

340909,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,6302859190,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 1]","Won't anyone think of the corn?That seems to be the plot of CHILDREN OF THE CORN II, a movie that claims to be THE FINAL SACRIFICE, this in spite of being succeeded by many, many sequels.  The first film was no great shakes, and inspires the question: how long does it take for people to forget how bad a film was?In this case, 8 years.In 1984, the original film bored theatre audiences, and then, in 1992, this weird and pointless follow-up was made, re-introducing the world to He Who Walks Behind The Rows.  What is up with this deity?  No one ever sees it (aside from the bulging ground that accompanies its movements).  If this movie is any indication, HWWBTR has some kind of severe color blindness, and an intense hatred of both adults and corn mold.In the first movie, this unlikely creature inspired a prophet by the name of Issac, a suitably creepy kid.  This time around the ""propeht"" is Micah, a kid whose uncanny resemblance to Keannu Reeves is the most interesting thing about the film.  Okay, well, that and a church scene involving a wooden voodoo doll (the movie's only legitimately creepy moment).Micah whips the local kids into a frenzy by yelling about people who have defiled the corn.  They set fire to churches and drop houses on old women (who cry out, a laThe Wizard of Oz, ""What a world!""  Is this supposed to be a parody?) and are generally creeptastic.  Here to thwart them are Garrett, a beefy tabloid reporter, and his smug and sullen son, Danny.  Oh, and lest I forget, Professor Red Bear, a Native American Anthropologist who steals wallets from cars and knows far less than he lets on.The demon (god? critter?) is given more of a motive this time around, but it only muddles up a movie that is already lacking focus or energy.  There are a few interesting special effects moments, but mostly the movie is as annoying as a bunch of prepubescent kids running around screeching, ""The corn!  The corn!  No one cares about the corn!""Someone get these kids someDoritos, for crying out loud.",2,"""Final""?

Funny word to mention here, ""miracles"", as the demented children are back, this time to teach the new residents in their town a horrifying lesson.This sequels budget is higher than the original, allowing for better effects and for higher pilings of gore,  the plot couldn't possibly be strong, and as a result no award winning actors were sought out. The original at least boasted a cool soundtrack; here we get some strange Indian sounding thing that didn't fit in the same way. It's apparent from the plot changes that they are trying to go a more 'evi' route, changing the rules from the original without much though. Here the little brats use technology to do their evil, which would never have happened in the original (It was forbidden)  They also have taken up some sort of voodoo?? WTF? If you're a fan of the original this may indeed come across like a slap in the face. Blasphemy!!I refuse to touch the ""tainted"" corn found...The teenage son, Danny, was made out to be too typically rebellious and hard to sympathize with. Thankfully, I didn't hate the character itself, but it could use some script  work.  Ryan Bollman as Micah was more nauseating than eerie, while Terence Knox and Christie Clark do well enough for what they had. As before, the characters hammed it up too much and induced eye rolling rather than hair raising. At least the 'huge mouth' boy didn't return for the sequel.One thing that IS passable here are some of the inventive slayings; how often do you get to see a lady in a wheelchair fly through the window of a bingo parlor?? Not often, that's for sure. The scene with the church guy is also pretty cool. It's obvious they tried to make up for plot and character holes by relying on eye candy....works sometimes.
