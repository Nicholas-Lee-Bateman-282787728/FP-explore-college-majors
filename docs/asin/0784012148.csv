Nearly 20 years later, after seeing it again on DVD and having a chance to reconsider it, I'm afraid I've had to lower my review of it considerably. For starters, this movie takes a long time to get going. Most of the pre-battle scenes are pointless, as they fail to do much in the way of character development or add anything to the story. Then when we finally do get to the battle for ""Hamburger Hill"" the action scenes are short and the scenes in between fighting do almost nothing to enrich the story. I bought this thinking it was a movie that I'd watch several more times, but after seeing it again I have to say that I'm ulikely to ever pull this one off the shelf again.",3,A second look reveals some shortcomings,1105747200,"01 15, 2005",2005,800,"['When', 'saw', 'movie', 'back', 'late', '1980s', 'remember', 'thinking', 'was', 'outstanding', 'portrayal', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'Nearly', '20', 'years', 'later', 'seeing', 'again', 'DVD', 'having', 'chance', 'reconsider', ""'m"", 'afraid', ""'ve"", 'had', 'lower', 'review', 'considerably', 'starters', 'movie', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'Most', 'pre-battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'pointless', 'fail', 'do', 'much', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'add', 'anything', 'story', 'Then', 'when', 'finally', 'do', 'get', 'battle', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'short', 'scenes', 'fighting', 'do', 'almost', 'nothing', 'enrich', 'story', 'bought', 'thinking', 'was', 'movie', ""'d"", 'watch', 'several', 'more', 'times', 'seeing', 'again', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'ulikely', 'ever', 'pull', 'one', 'shelf', 'again']",N/A

White phosphorous is dropped. Troops are trucked to a new site. They dig up the ground to make sandbags. A wrong word can cause conflicts. Some troops relax in a tub. The soldiers are warned about the tropical diseases found in Vietnam, and the need for proper hygiene. A sergeant warns them about the enemy, do not underestimate them. They show the soldiers in camp. ""Incoming!"" ""It's one of the new guys."" Drinking at a bar caused a conflict. The soldiers are sent back to the valley and walk until they are attacked. They rest and talk. As they move out there is a mortar attack, they return fire. Night falls. There is a propaganda broadcast at night.They advance during the day and get into combat again. Airplanes drop napalm and white phosphorous. They take a bunker. Helicopters fire on their own troops! They need food and water. A taped message brings news from home. They advance up the hill and have more casualties. The rain pours down. Some slip down the muddy hill. ""It don't mean nothing."" Finally they capture the hill. Then other hills need to be taken. This was in May 1969.In 1968 there was talk of a cease-fire that would end the war. But a new regime was elected and the war continued for another five years. The total war dead was 55 thousand instead of the 22 thousand up to 1969. This film seems less dramatic than others made around the same time.

I cannot address the issue of the absolute truth of the way specific events are depicted in the film because I wasn't involved in this particular action, but I can say with no equivocation that the characters and combat shown in this film are absolutely realistic based on my experience. The fictional soldiers shown in the film talk like we talked, and all aspects of combat shown are much like my own experience. Some aspects of this film may seem cliched to some viewers (see below), but that is just the common reality of war and reveals the simplistic views of the times.

77038,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,0784012148,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[7, 13]","HAMBURGER HILL is ultra-realistic because it has no plot, no characterization to speak of, and simply depicts the bravery and insanity  of warfare.  But what puts it over the top in terms of realism is the scene  just after the movie is halfway through, with the American soldiers  struggling to take the hill against the unseen Vietnamese enemy, and just  as they're exhausted, they see US helicopters coming, and they're relieved  -- BUT the helicopters start machine-gunning the American soldiers!  &quot;No&quot; they wave frantically, but the machine-gunning continues,  and you know that the gunners in the helicopters can't tell whether they're  shooting at Americans or Vietnamese, because the Vietnamese would be smart  enough also to wave their hands and say &quot;no.&quot;  So the carnage  continues.  &quot;Friendly fire&quot; occurred very often in World War II,  probably far more often than in Vietnam, except it has been kept a dark  military secret, and I only found out about it by talking with an ex-Marine  colonel, who confirmed my guess that a great many American soldiers were  killed by their own side, especially in the South Pacific.  This colonel  told me that there was such competition between the Army and Navy (and this  we all know from the studies of the Second World War) that when marines  were sent from ship to shore, they were in a non-jurisdictional place,  neither under control of the Navy which had transported them to the island,  nor the Army which was already on the beach and awaiting reinforcements.  The Army Air Corps was bombing away and killed many of these US marines.  After the War, the various services were consolidated into a Department of  Defense in order to avoid these inter-service rivalries and wastage, but  traditions have remained and there is still a lack of coordination and an  inter-service suspicion.  But my point here is that you can watch a World  War II movie in vain to see even the slightest hint of deaths from friendly  fire.  So that's what makes the scene in HAMBURGER HILL so revealing.  Even  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, with its great opening scene of the landing at  Normandy Beach, shies away from the &quot;friendly fire&quot; problem.  Unfortunately, HAMBURGER HILL, after depicting it, has an interim scene  where everyone is sitting around the camp, and no one mentions the  &quot;friendly fire&quot; that has just occurred!  It's as if they shot the  movie in segments (which is usually the movies are shot), and then spliced  them together, without caring about continuity.  You can see how this would  happen: because there is no plot, no one bothered about continuity.  Therefore, while I can recommend HAMBURGER HILL if you want to experience  what battles are really like from the soldier's point of view, don't be  looking for a story.  The absence of a good screenplay is why I think it  would be misleading to give this movie any more than three stars.  Bottom  line: if you are a war-movies fan, the realism of HAMBURGER HILL is nothing  short of amazing.",3,One of the Most Realistic War Movies Ever Made,966988800,"08 23, 2000",2000,3049,"['HAMBURGER', 'HILL', 'ultra-realistic', 'plot', 'characterization', 'speak', 'simply', 'bravery', 'insanity', 'warfare', 'what', 'top', 'terms', 'realism', 'scene', 'just', 'movie', 'halfway', 'American', 'soldiers', 'struggling', 'take', 'hill', 'unseen', 'Vietnamese', 'enemy', 'just', ""'re"", 'exhausted', 'see', 'US', 'helicopters', 'coming', ""'re"", 'relieved', 'helicopters', 'start', 'machine-gunning', 'American', 'soldiers', 'quot', 'No', 'quot', 'wave', 'frantically', 'machine-gunning', 'know', 'gunners', 'helicopters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', ""'re"", 'shooting', 'Americans', 'Vietnamese', 'Vietnamese', 'would', 'be', 'smart', 'enough', 'also', 'wave', 'hands', 'say', 'quot', 'no.', 'quot', 'carnage', 'quot', 'Friendly', 'fire', 'quot', 'occurred', 'very', 'often', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'probably', 'far', 'more', 'often', 'Vietnam', 'been', 'kept', 'dark', 'military', 'secret', 'only', 'found', 'out', 'talking', 'ex-Marine', 'colonel', 'who', 'confirmed', 'guess', 'great', 'many', 'American', 'soldiers', 'were', 'killed', 'own', 'side', 'especially', 'South', 'Pacific', 'colonel', 'told', 'was', 'such', 'competition', 'Army', 'Navy', 'know', 'studies', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'when', 'marines', 'were', 'sent', 'ship', 'shore', 'were', 'non-jurisdictional', 'place', 'control', 'Navy', 'had', 'transported', 'island', 'Army', 'was', 'already', 'beach', 'awaiting', 'reinforcements', 'Army', 'Air', 'Corps', 'was', 'bombing', 'away', 'killed', 'many', 'US', 'marines', 'War', 'various', 'services', 'were', 'consolidated', 'Department', 'Defense', 'order', 'avoid', 'inter-service', 'rivalries', 'wastage', 'traditions', 'have', 'remained', 'still', 'lack', 'coordination', 'inter-service', 'suspicion', 'point', 'here', 'can', 'watch', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'movie', 'vain', 'see', 'even', 'slightest', 'hint', 'deaths', 'friendly', 'fire', 'what', 'scene', 'HAMBURGER', 'HILL', 'so', 'revealing', 'Even', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'great', 'opening', 'scene', 'landing', 'Normandy', 'Beach', 'away', 'quot', 'friendly', 'fire', 'quot', 'problem', 'Unfortunately', 'HAMBURGER', 'HILL', 'depicting', 'interim', 'scene', 'where', 'everyone', 'sitting', 'camp', 'one', 'quot', 'friendly', 'fire', 'quot', 'just', 'occurred', 'shot', 'movie', 'segments', 'usually', 'movies', 'are', 'shot', 'then', 'spliced', 'together', 'caring', 'continuity', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'would', 'happen', 'plot', 'one', 'bothered', 'continuity', 'Therefore', 'can', 'recommend', 'HAMBURGER', 'HILL', 'want', 'experience', 'what', 'battles', 'are', 'really', 'soldier', 'point', 'view', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'looking', 'story', 'absence', 'good', 'screenplay', 'why', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'misleading', 'give', 'movie', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'Bottom', 'line', 'are', 'war-movies', 'fan', 'realism', 'HAMBURGER', 'HILL', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing']",N/A

HAMBURGER HILL is, by far, the most realistic Viet Nam war film yet made.  It works on two levels.The battle scenes are superbly rendered.  The Viet Cong and NVA are seen crouching safely in well protected bunkers when American airpower is unleasehed upon them.  Time and again they are bombed with napalm and white phosphorus, but to no avail.  The Americans slog endlessly up the muddy Hill 937 during intense Monsoon conditions.  Snipers pop out of tunnels and shoot them from behind.The film packs an emotional wallop, as well.  From the first scene at the mall in Washington, DC where the camera tracks along panels of the Vietnam memorial, where one entire panel is made of the names of those who fell at Hill 937 we disolve to a firefight : a Godforsaken clearing in the A Shau valley, the valley of death...the film seeks to bring the stories of the dead to life.  The focus is clearly on the soldiers as we learn of their daily struggles to fight a war in which those on the home front have given up on.

Baer,"[2, 2]","The most startling aspect of this gripping account of the 101st Airborne's assault on Hill 937 is that this was not even the bloodiest battle fought by the 101st in Vietnam. That one took place at Dat To and produced more than five times the U.S. casualties, occasioning the throw-away parenthesis of one of Hill's actors, '*that* was a hill ....'.Hamburger Hill, as it came to be known, was arguably a defensible military move. Its real importance to the national memory is a function of how it triggered outrage back home at what seemed an inordinate sacrifice of human life for a hill that was soon abandoned. It may be that the purpose of a 'search and destroy' battle was not understood, making the desertion of such hard-fought soil appear callous to the point of insanity.The film only touches upon those matters, focusing instead on the daily, muddy, bloody grind of the grunts charged with taking the hill. WIth none of the star quality of, say, Oliver Stone's Platoon, the viewer instead is taken in by the simply grittiness of the soldiers and the muddy hell they were tasked to climb.They did what they were asked, of course. In the final scenes, one is struck by the absence of celebration when they realize what they've accomplished. Weariness and grief trump the hypotheticals of joy.For anyone wanting to come to grips with the Vietnam experience by the flawed window of cinema, Hamburger Hill must be on the list of must-sees. Less edgy and political than Platoon and Full Metal Jacket (the late 80's release of those films bookended and to some degree overshadowed this one.).What happens here is closer to the ground. The mud. The blood. The cameradie of surviving brothers too weary to smile.

77047,A2KWG1J285Z4QA,0784012148,David Baltazar,"[34, 36]","This review is from;Hamburger Hill (20th Anniversary Edition)""Hamburger Hill"" is a Vietnam War movie that deserves to be a classic in its own right, but unfortunately it will always be not as highly recognized as the more popular movies of its genre including the highly regarded ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Platoon"" (all made by very revered directors Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick & Oliver Stone, respectively). Director John Irvin's ""Hamburger Hill"" is gritty, action packed and straight to the point film about the 3rd battalion of the 101st Airborne Division's assault on hill 937 in Vietnam from May 10 to 20, 1969. A bloody battle that had nearly a 70% casualty rate.  Although underappreciated I personally liked this movie, but rather than review this movie as many others already have under the original Artisan DVD release link, I just wanted to point out the features for the new ""20th Anniversary"" release. I owned the prior DVD by Artisan (from 2001) and I decided to splurge on the new, 2008 release by Lions Gate.The 20th Anniversary release of ""Hamburger Hill"" was given a new, anamorphic widescreen transfer by Lions Gate. Although I thought the old Artisan DVD contained a decent transfer, there were some imperfections or spots on the film. Not much, but some. The colors on the old transfer also looked slightly faded and fuzzy. The new transfer on the otherhand, looks slightly sharper and more focused. The imperfections I saw on the old transfer are gone on the new one. Great clean up job! I'm not really an expert on sound, but the new DVD contains a digital 5.1 sound track which for the most part sounds almost identical to the Artisan DVD. Although this is not really a complaint, the scene selection in the old transfer had 36 chapter stops while the new transfer has only 16. This is probably irrelevant to most people, but I just thought I would take note of it.The 20th Anniversary DVD now contains commentary tracks from the film's writer/Producer Jim Carabatsos and actors Anthony Barrile, Harry O'Reilly and Daniel O'Shea. Most of the commentary is from Carabastos. Some of the commentary is screen specific, but most of it is about the films' origin and production. The actors mostly talk about their auditions and boot camp experiences at Subic Bay, Philippines in addition to their own experiences on the film.The new release now contains a couple of new featurettes. One is called ""The Appearance of Reality"" (16 minutes, 50 seconds). This is your standard behind the scenes, film crew & cast interviews with some film footage. We also hear from director John Irvin and writer/Producer Jim Carabatsos. The feature also covers the difficulties encountered while making the film in the Philippines. Watching this reminded me of some the difficulties encountered when ""Apocalypse Now"" was made which was well covered in the documentary ""Hearts of Darkness"". Some of the troubled moments during the filming of ""Hamburger Hill"" included an electrician that was electrocuted (and died) during filming, a typhoon, some local fighting during the Aquino revolution against the Marcos Regime and some sniper fire towards the actors' van at night (the van had to drive with the lights off and the passengers had to crouch down for safety to avoid the sniper fire!).The other featurette is called ""Medics in Vietnam"" which is about medics (about 6 minutes). Although very short in length, I still think it's great that some well, deserved recognition is given to the medics in the battlefield and some basic, understanding about how vital they are as supporting units in the battlefield. We hear excerpts from actor Courtney Vance who played medic Doc Johnson in the film as well as a military historian Colonel Robert Tomlinson, book author Artur Wiknik Jr. and former medic Bob Rogers. I found it interesting that some of the medics that went to Vietnam had such distinct backrounds. Some were ex-infantry men and some were conscientious objectors that didn't want to fight in the war, but wanted to help in the effort nevertheless.The DVD also has an interactive ""Vietnam War Timeline"" filled with interesting key dates and facts. The timeline has a sixteen different date menus in chronological order from 1867 (the French Colonization) to 1975 (the American withdrawal). When you select each date with your DVD player's remote, some text notes, map locations and/or pictures appear to explain what happened in that specific time period you selected. Neat!The last features on the DVD are trailers for other Lions Gate films including ""Reservoir Dogs 15th Anniversary"" (and video game preview), American Psycho, 3:10 to Yuma and Rambo (the new 2008 DVD and the Rambo ""Ultimate Edition"" set). Note there is NO trailer for ""Hamburger Hill"" on the 20th Anniversary DVD, but if you have purchased the new 2008 ""Rambo"" two-disc DVD set, the trailer for ""Hamburger Hill"" (20th Anniversary DVD) is there.My only, minor complaint about the new DVD is the absence of actor Don Chealde from the featurette and the commentary. Chealde became famous later for his many roles in other films such as ""Hotel Rwanda"" & ""Ocean's Eleven"". Although his role in ""Hamburger Hill"" is somewhat minor (a stepping stone for him at the time), I appreciated all of his work and I still would of liked to hear any of his insights about ""Hamburger Hill"" despite the fact that he has become a much, more acclaimed actor now than he was back then. Otherwise, I think this is a worthy upgrade for fans of the film who owned the prior DVD and a worthy purchase for new viewers. Improved picture and some interesting features made the ""20th Anniversary"" a good purchase for me and possibly for you?",4,"A Second Helping of ""Hamburger"" Anyone?",1212019200,"05 29,

With their chiseled cheeks and cleft chins, these guys are just not what I would expect to find lying on their backs, working on a broken down Jeep in a war zone.

Nonetheless, this is still an excellent movie.  Many of our soldiers in Vietnam, regrettably, did not understand why it was necessary to fight the evil Communists.  When push came to shove, they fought and died on behalf of their comrades and an ambiguous sense of duty.  May God bless them.  Those of us who never fought for our country are especially obligated to learn about their sacrifices.The acting and dialogue in this film are superb.  And yes, it is very brutal.  Little is left to the imagination.  Hamburger Hill is not for the squeamish.  But that's why you should see it.

As I understand it the 101st airborne Division (or the ""Pukin Buzzards"" as the 25th called them) was to our immediate North.  The few things that were not realistic were:- I never saw a hot tub,- We never deployed a platoon by itself, minimum  Company strength.i.e.  At least three [platoons.The movie's anti-war message is apparent from the opening credits, which are interspersed with views of the Capitol and the Vietnam Memorial in Washington. The symbolism of our seat of government juxtaposed with the memorial to the fallen is heightened by the wintry sunset reflecting off the Vietnam Memorial.Rather than a history lesson, the movie is a metaphor for the war in Vietnam: the relentless push to achieve ground of questionable importance despite the high cost in blood. Good men fought and died.Was it worth it? As the fatalistic mantra among the grunts in the movie said, ""It don't mean nothin'.""

77063,AJUWDV8TMBPL5,0784012148,G. Zawada,"[1, 2]","Hamburger Hill, coming out in early 1987, became one of the most tragically fated films in recent memory, in that it came out between two other, high-budgeted, media-pumped Vietnam War films (Platoon and Full Metal Jacket). Despite this ill-fated fact, rendering HH a failure at the box office, the movie remains a wrenching portrayal of the hard times experienced by soldiers in Vietnam.The movie utilizes a relatively unknown cast, which surprisingly seems to work to the film's advantage. The only names that stick out are Dylan McDermott (pre-Practice days) as Sgt. Frantz, a savvy but young vet in his second tour and Don Cheadle (in one of his first motion picture performances.)The film concerns itself primarily with a 10-day trek up a steep hill based on real-life events that happened during the days of major fighting in Vietnam. As in the actual event, the movie ends bleakly, but my uncle (uncaring about the emotional melodrama found in most movies) claims that it is the most accurate war film he's seen to date. This is where the film succeeds in spewing out the idea that all this human sacrifice for a few measly yards of land may not have been worth it. Although this theme seems to pervade through the movie, it does not shame the soldier's efforts in partaking in the war. Rather, it commemorates them, and pities their situation.The movie loses touch with me in that it seems to split, rather than integrate two of the major themes during the Vietnam War; the difficulties associated with basic training and ""getting to know one another"", and the harshness and inhumanity of war itself. It seems as if director John Irvin felt compelled to present an account of comraderie and training as if it were a mandatory part of any warfilm, and in doing so did a mediocre job. The first 40 minutes is separated as an unneeded and meddled ""mini-movie.""It is for this reason that I gave the movie 4 stars. Ranking it with other war films of this era, I would put it ahead of Full Metal Jacket, but behind the rest (Platoon, Deer Hunter, Good Morning Vietnam).

77071,AF7YB1DXSGMLY,0784012148,Jonathon Rehlander,"[4, 12]","Of all the films made about the Vietnam conflict, this one is the most cliched and boring of the bunch.  Without comparing this one to the others, however, let's take a look at it on its own.The battle the film depicts was the perfect choice for a film about a war as futile as this one.  The point of taking the hill is unclear, the benefit unknown, and the sheer carnage unimaginable.  The battle is a metaphor for the entire war.  The cast is talented, with several young stars making an early impression.  The potential for a great film is here, but the film does not live up to the ingredients that go into it.The film has several scenes that have the chance to bring a point home.  The scene where Dylan McDermott is lecturing the new troops is shot very well, with the sabateur making his way toward the group.  However, the script is filled with lines that sound like a Hollywood screenwriter trying to sound like a soldier.  When Dylan says &quot;I'm going to save your life and you're going to save mine,&quot; you want to cringe because it sounds so canned.The film deals with race issues, but again the effect is forced and unbelievable.  These guys sit around making soliloquies that lack any feeling of realness to them, because the director is trying to show the profoundness of what they are going through by making the speech profound.  Grunts don't sit around like a group of cappucino-swilling beat poets pondering the deeper meaning of what is happening to them like this.  The actors speak with a perspective that seems to convey that they already know what their personal outcome is, but they are going to live their role regardless of it.Now compare the film to others made about the war, and this film pales further.  While more stylistic, a film like Full Metal Jacket carries a much greater impact than this one, and Platoon is still Jacket's rival as the standard for Vietnam films.

From the horror of fighting to the companionship and camaraderie of the men who faced death together, this film is a chilling tale of what really happened.The film covers many aspects of war, including racial tensions, courage, and trust, without being overly patriotic or resorting to theatrics to create emotional ties with the audience. This story is more truth than many war movies I have seen. The truth can sometimes be brutal and harsh, like when the American airmen shoot their own soldiers.In the beginning of the film, ""the camera speeds rapidly over scenes of the Vietnamese bush, intercut with shots of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.""  This shows that the film is intended to be a memorial of sorts to those who died in the war, and in particular, on Hill 937. The film attempts to bring the stories of the dead to life.The men on the front were abandoned by the people at home and by the media. The only people they had to count on were each other. No one cared about what they were doing except the enemy.On the last day of battle, there are a couple of times in the film when triumphant music can be heard above the fray, possibly signaling the end of the battle and the victory of the Americans. The fighting continues, however, and when victory does come for the U.S., there is no music, no pomp and circumstance. This lack of music shows that war and victory are not glorious, and that victory is only in abstract terms. Basically, human lives are not worth any amount of ground, and a muddy hill is certainly not worth human sacrifice.This was a good film. I liked it more than Platoon or Pork Chop Hill.

The strength of the film is that all the events of the battle are incredibly accurate in terms of detail.

The needed more exposition scenes in the second half of the film explaining what was going on and why things were happening. Especially from the first and second level officer's perspective.Its interesting in that the viewer of the film not familar with the battle will see it just like the soldier on the ground saw it: a confusing mess. I'm not sure if that perspective at the cost of understanding what was going on was the right choice to make.The only other flaw in an otherwise great movie is a bunch of political bitching about things going on at home that was tacked on at one point and sounded totally false.

Though I liked some others such as ""Platoon"" and the 2nd half of ""Full Metal Jacket""--none compare to ""Hamburger Hill.""I grew up in the days of Walter Cronkite, etc. giving us the daily body count at dinnertime. As a child Ilived in a military-base town during the Vietnam War era. Many of the young ""men"" [boys!] in my community were called to service, then.Some never came back. They were heroes to me, though. As a child back then; the War seemed very real to me. Most of the parents worked on the base in some fashion--my father was no exception.Years later I worked as a medic: my ambulance partner was a 'Nam vet. He spoke of the realism of essentially ""a-day-in-life-of"" military experience when he saw this film.Though I'd read some Vietnam War books, saw films, talked to vets, etc., I wasn't familiar with the place in Vietnam where my best friend's husband really broke down with severe PTSD.She told me how he'd survived someintense fighting on a ""hill"" in the ""Ashau Valley."" My friend's husband in a real sense lost his life in those days on that Hill; for soon after he returned to the ""world"" he blew his brains out at home in front of his 2 kids ages: 2 & 4 while, on the phone with his wife.Saying I felt ""goosebumps"" when I started watching this film is an understatement, when I'd heard my friend talk many times of her husband and the Ashau.I really liked the simplistic dynamics of this film. Some have said it is shallow as to character development, racial tension or whatever. This is true; yet in this film--simplicity works.We don't need to sympathize or empathize or even know who the real or the lavk of portrayed depth of the characters.To me, the movie seemed as though I was sort of an observer into the day-to-day activities of the platoon--like I'd just arrived in the middle of something.In other words, it would be like if I had an observer [as often happened] spend a shift with me at the ambulance service I worked at--we wasn't going to go into any detail about getting the rider to really understand our work, conversation, nuances, etc. The rider, like the movie's viewer just happens to step into these few days of the battle.In ""Hamburger Hill"" we the viewer are like a temporary observer [i.e. Iraq's ""embedded reporter?""] in the goings about of these men at a high impact battle.Another war film that does this ""as if walking in the middle with no heads up approach]-- and is almost equally as excellent at pulling it off is ""Stalingrad,"" which I highly recommend, in addition to ""Hamburger Hill.""P.S.

77081,A3CCYAQRHUTPIQ,0784012148,Mr. A. Pomeroy,"[13, 29]","Coming out at nearly the same time as 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket', Hamburger Hill did not win an Academy Award and was not directed by Stanley Kubrick. Thus, it's tempting to give the film the benefit of the doubt, as it is the underdog. Politically 'Hamburger Hill' is sympathetic towards the soldiers and anti-peacenik, which caused reviewers to loathe the film at the time. This is yet another reason to like Hamburger Hill. Which would be a mistake, as Hamburger Hill still isn't very good. It's far superior to John Wayne's 'The Green Berets', but as a piece of film-making, notwithstanding the politics, its inferior to Stone and Kubrick's admittedly flawed films. It's full of good intentions and clearly writer John Carabatsos put a lot of work and passion into it, but at the risk of seeming to kick a puppy in the face this doesn't make Hamburger Hill any better. It must be noted that I am British, born a year after the Vietnam War ended, and thus the war has no particular emotional resonance for me. Indeed my whole view of the Vietnam War is informed more by films such as this than history books.The plot is simple; for the first half of the film we are introduced to a bunch of soldiers and learn about how they function as a group, and for the second half of the film we witness them assault a hill which seems to be of limited strategic importance. As with 'We Were Soldiers' the battle sequences are the key, the one part of the film which works well; although 'Saving Private Ryan' has upped the bar since then, the depiction of combat as a confused mess of people firing great quantities of ammunition at nothing is much more vivid than the fighting in either of the more illustrious films aforementioned. Although critics tend to ignore or bypass the effect of battle action sequences in war films, and film-makers try to minimise their screentime for fear of running over budget, a war without fighting is not a war, and one can more easily understand the pain and terror of war by seeing explosions and gunfire, rather than through sentimental speeches or symbolic shots of rain falling into muddy puddles. There is friendly fire, torrential rain, and the fighting often becomes more reminiscent of WW1 trench warfare than something taking place a month before mankind first stepped on the moon.Also as with 'We Were Soldiers', the non-battle sequences are entirely disposable, with hokey, cliched 'Vietnam War' dialogue delivered none too convincingly by a cast who seem much too well-scrubbed and attractive to be a true microcosm of a certain section of American society. It is the kind of film where people manage a final speech before they die, during which time the noise of battle fades into the background; it is the kind of film where one character turns over a body and - gasp - it's a man we saw earlier, and we are supposed to feel sad although we don't know any of the people or care much about them; it is the kind of film where a shot of a helmet bouncing down a hill is meant to make us feel reflective. In this respect it is rather like one of the bleaker WW2/Korean war films, such as 'Pork Chop Hill', which had a similar premise, or 'Hell is for Heroes'. Or for that matter the earlier, far superior 'All Quiet on the Western Front', albeit at an incline. The message that one should not condemn the fighting man, even when the war he is fighting is a giant political mistake, is an admirable one, and it's a shame that this message could not have been put across by a better film.Because it is impossible to care about the characters - they don't seem real, they don't say real things and the actors don't seem real - the film fails right there. One of the film's points is that the soldiers attacking the hill are meat, cut down like cattle, but I feel nothing when cattle are killed, and thus I feel nothing when the characters in Hamburger Hill bite the mud. There is an attempt at portraying racial tension between the soldiers, something which 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket' ignored, but it's Hollywood-style racial tension and ultimately has no bearing on the plot. The evil white rednecks abuse the poor, soulful blacks - one of whom is even called 'Motown' - until they eventually see sense and become brothers over the space of a single conversation. The cast are mostly neophytes who went on to careers in television; particularly noteworthy is Courtney Vance as the Doctor, who mugs wildly and has one of the aforementioned Hollywood-style death scenes.In summary, therefore, Hamburger Hill has some excellent battle sequences, but it's too wedded to Hollywood cliche to feel really shocked or saddened by anything that happens, and without any kind of emotional core the end result seems as sterile and meaningless as 'Full Metal Jacket', without the black comedy of Kubrick's film.Outside the generally superb depictions of infantry combat, particularly so during the rainy sequences near the end of the film, there are a couple of poor special effects (a shot of a soldier being blown apart by machinegun fire is terrible, whilst some of the large-scale explosions resemble firecrackers), and the reusing of footage of Phantom jets dropping napalm, but this is no worse than any other film of the period.The music is by Philip Glass, although fans of Glass should be aware that his score, which sounds exactly like any other piece of Philip Glass' music, is played for less than five minutes during the film (which is mostly without music, or as was the tradition with these films, contemporary pop songs such as the Animals' 'We've Gotta Get Out of This Place' - played as the soldiers are helicoptered *into* battle, do you see the symbolism?). It's curious to note that the DVD case now has a prominent American flag, where before the film's poster was a moody silhouette of a man standing in front of some helicopters. The DVD itself has no extra features of any consequence, nada, where for example a documentary about the actual battle would have been a logical addition.",2,Despite all that,1066003200,"10 13,

I am sure that happened a lot more than we know about. The way it was filmed showed how a UH-1 (Huey) machinegunner on a .30 cal could not tell, even at the range close enough to kill, whether he was shooting ours or theirs.In Born on the 4th of July, one casuality due to friendly fire was shown, here we see a squad or a platoon taken out. The strength of this film lies in the portrayal of the camaraderie building over time in the unit, better shown here than in Platoon, which was better in other ways, or in Casualties of War, which showed the opposite of camaraderie.Fighting men pull together over time, regardless of their different backgrounds, and this film showed that.Criticisms: All the M-16 fire, always full auto, was wasted: ""spray and pray"" I think it is called. Didn`t the 101st train their soldiers how to aim their weapons? I saw soldiers shoot tens of thousands of rounds of ammo, and scream for more ammo, but I did not see one soldier aim his weapon.

Not that it's bad, it just pales in comparison to other Nam films like ""Platoon,"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).The story focuses on one platoon as they try again and again to take hill 937 (that is, 937 feet high) during a 10-day period in May, 1969. The hill was nicknamed Hamburger Hill because enemy fire was so fierce that American troops were shredded like hamburger meat.The film has an excellent cast highlighted by Dylan McDermott and Steven Weber (fromWings: The Complete Series) as squad sergeants, Courtney B. Vance as the medic ""Doc,"" and Tim Quill, Don Cheadle and Anthony Barrile as privates, the latter who strongly resembles Boner from ""Growing Pains.""""Hamburger Hill"" successfully details the lives of grunts during the Vietnam War who, not only have to face their enemy in SE Asia, but growing resistance from their contemporaries at home. Although the film definitely comes off as a Grade-B ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" it features quite a few aspects that make it unique and notable, like an episode of friendly fire, soldiers getting ""Dear John"" letters, mudsliding down a hill during warfare, etc.It's also notable for its documentary-like style. ""Hamburger Hill"" makes no attempt to divert to the deeper subtexts of those two more successful Nam films; it's a picture solely about the Vietnam experience of infantryman taking a hill. The futility of the endeavor is a microcosm of the futility of the Vietnam War itself.Obviously, this documentary-like style is appealing to many, as witnessed by the numerous high ratings, particularly those who prefer ultra-realism. Unfortunately, it's sometimes diminished by contrived sequences (acting, dialogue, etc.). Regardless, such an approach won't be satisfactory for those who favor a more substantial story, stronger characters and a deeper subtext.Concerning the film's depiction of the typical grunt, just once I'd like to see a movie dare to show soldiers, Marines, etc. doing something other than boozing it up and visiting prostitutes on R & R. Even if most enlisted men did this in Vietnam, I'm sure there were many who coped with the stress of combat in more healthy, positive ways.The film was shot in the Philippines and runs 110 minutes. Excellent locations, by the way.GRADE: C+",3,A documentary-style film of the Nam experience,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",2012,2410,"['Hamburger', 'Hill', 'came', 'out', 'late', 'summer', '1987', 'mega-success', 'Platoon', 'previous', 'Christmas', 'was', 'decidedly', 'underwhelming', 'Not', 'bad', 'just', 'comparison', 'other', 'Nam', 'films', 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', '1979', '.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'one', 'platoon', 'try', 'again', 'again', 'take', 'hill', '937', '937', 'feet', 'high', '10-day', 'period', 'May', '1969', 'hill', 'was', 'nicknamed', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'enemy', 'fire', 'was', 'so', 'fierce', 'American', 'troops', 'were', 'shredded', 'hamburger', 'meat.The', 'film', 'excellent', 'cast', 'highlighted', 'Dylan', 'McDermott', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'fromWings', 'Complete', 'Series', 'squad', 'sergeants', 'Courtney', 'B.', 'Vance', 'medic', 'Doc', 'Tim', 'Quill', 'Don', 'Cheadle', 'Anthony', 'Barrile', 'privates', 'latter', 'who', 'strongly', 'Boner', 'Growing', 'Pains', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'successfully', 'details', 'lives', 'grunts', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'have', 'face', 'enemy', 'SE', 'Asia', 'growing', 'resistance', 'contemporaries', 'home', 'film', 'definitely', 'off', 'Grade-B', 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'quite', 'few', 'aspects', 'make', 'unique', 'notable', 'episode', 'friendly', 'fire', 'soldiers', 'getting', 'Dear', 'John', 'letters', 'mudsliding', 'down', 'hill', 'warfare', 'etc.It', 'also', 'notable', 'documentary-like', 'style', 'Hamburger', 'Hill', 'attempt', 'divert', 'deeper', 'subtexts', 'two', 'more', 'successful', 'Nam', 'films', 'picture', 'solely', 'Vietnam', 'experience', 'infantryman', 'taking', 'hill', 'futility', 'endeavor', 'microcosm', 'futility', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'itself.Obviously', 'documentary-like', 'style', 'appealing', 'many', 'witnessed', 'numerous', 'high', 'ratings', 'particularly', 'who', 'prefer', 'ultra-realism', 'Unfortunately', 'sometimes', 'diminished', 'contrived', 'sequences', 'acting', 'dialogue', 'etc.', 'Regardless', 'approach', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'satisfactory', 'who', 'favor', 'more', 'substantial', 'story', 'stronger', 'characters', 'deeper', 'subtext.Concerning', 'film', 'depiction', 'typical', 'grunt', 'just', 'once', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'movie', 'dare', 'show', 'soldiers', 'Marines', 'etc', 'doing', 'something', 'other', 'boozing', 'visiting', 'prostitutes', 'R', 'R.', 'Even', 'most', 'enlisted', 'men', 'did', 'Vietnam', ""'m"", 'sure', 'were', 'many', 'who', 'coped', 'stress', 'combat', 'more', 'healthy', 'positive', 'ways.The', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Philippines', '110', 'minutes', 'Excellent', 'locations', 'way.GRADE', 'C+']",N/A
