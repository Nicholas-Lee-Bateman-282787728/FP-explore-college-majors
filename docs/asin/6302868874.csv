341651,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6302868874,Erik North,"[1, 1]","The grievously underrated 1993 docudrama ALIVE is based on a tragic but true story involving survival at its most basic in the inhumane and cold wastes of the Andes.On October 13, 1972, a Uruguayan air force plane carrying forty passengers (most of them members of a rugby squad) and a crew of five crashed 11,000 feet high in the Andes.  Twenty-one died either instantly in the plane crash or from injuries they suffered for weeks after.  Eight others were killed when a nighttime avalanche all but buried what was left of the fuselage.  Sixteen survived after two of their own breached the Andes; all were freed from their ordeal by Christmas Eve.  But part of their survival over a ten week period of sub-zero cold and death lay in their having to eat the bodies of the dead.Like IN COLD BLOOD, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, and (later) APOLLO 13, ALIVE stays true to the well-known facts of this tragic ordeal.  Director Frank Marshall shares with his mentor Steven Spielberg a gift for putting the viewer in the shoes of the film's protagonists.  Each aspect of the story is explored, including the undeniable fact that cannibalism played a part in it.  But unlike the gory 1976 Mexican exploitation flick SURVIVE!, ALIVE does not dwell on that gruesome aspect for too long.  The film is excellent on all technical levels (including the plane crash sequence, one of the most horrifying ever depicted on screen), and the cast, including Ethan Hawke and Josh Hamilton, accurately portray the participants in this story.For those who appreciate films based on real-life events, ALIVE is a definite must-see, despite its unavoidably gruesome subtext.",5,Tragic And True,996537600,"07 31, 2001",2001,1646,"['grievously', 'underrated', '1993', 'docudrama', 'ALIVE', 'based', 'tragic', 'true', 'story', 'involving', 'survival', 'most', 'basic', 'inhumane', 'cold', 'wastes', 'Andes.On', 'October', '13', '1972', 'Uruguayan', 'air', 'force', 'plane', 'carrying', 'forty', 'passengers', 'most', 'members', 'rugby', 'squad', 'crew', 'five', 'crashed', '11,000', 'feet', 'high', 'Andes', 'Twenty-one', 'died', 'instantly', 'plane', 'crash', 'injuries', 'suffered', 'weeks', 'Eight', 'others', 'were', 'killed', 'when', 'nighttime', 'avalanche', 'buried', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'fuselage', 'Sixteen', 'survived', 'two', 'own', 'breached', 'Andes', 'were', 'freed', 'ordeal', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'part', 'survival', 'ten', 'week', 'period', 'sub-zero', 'cold', 'death', 'lay', 'having', 'eat', 'bodies', 'dead.Like', 'IN', 'COLD', 'BLOOD', 'ALL', 'THE', 'PRESIDENT', 'MEN', 'later', 'APOLLO', '13', 'ALIVE', 'true', 'well-known', 'facts', 'tragic', 'ordeal', 'Director', 'Frank', 'Marshall', 'shares', 'mentor', 'Steven', 'Spielberg', 'gift', 'putting', 'viewer', 'shoes', 'film', 'protagonists', 'aspect', 'story', 'explored', 'including', 'undeniable', 'fact', 'cannibalism', 'played', 'part', 'gory', '1976', 'Mexican', 'exploitation', 'flick', 'SURVIVE', 'ALIVE', 'not', 'dwell', 'gruesome', 'aspect', 'too', 'long', 'film', 'excellent', 'technical', 'levels', 'including', 'plane', 'crash', 'sequence', 'one', 'most', 'horrifying', 'ever', 'depicted', 'screen', 'cast', 'including', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'accurately', 'participants', 'story.For', 'who', 'appreciate', 'films', 'based', 'real-life', 'events', 'ALIVE', 'definite', 'must-see', 'unavoidably', 'gruesome', 'subtext']",N/A

Well acted and directed, this movie recounts a great survival story, comparable to Captain Bligh leading all but one of his crew to safety after about 3500 or so miles in a small open boat (book ""Men Against The Sea""), or Richard Byrd surviving the Antarctic while seriously sick and injured (book ""Alone"").The fact that anyone even made it through the initial crash, then tobogganing at about 200 MPH down a mountain in a portion of airplane fuselage is unbelievable by itself. Add the fact that many people, prepared about as well as you or I in our living rooms, lived for 70 days way up on a frozen mountainside, makes it even more fantastic.To top it off, after weeks of planning and preparation, two of the fittest members hike around and down a 13,500 ft mountain, then trek 50 or 60 miles in 10 days through utter exhaustion, to finally reach help.It is difficult to really imagine the hardship they went through, even though it is essentially laid out on screen. The days or weeks of planning seemingly small events, and meeting with disaster on most accounts (finding the tail portion with the radio batteries, then having to go back to get the radio because the batteries were too heavy to carry, then not being able to fix the radio, etc.) is bad enough. I can not think of anything worse than having to eat your dead friends, for 50 days in a row, to just get through another day.I'm going to finish the last 20 pages of the book tonight. It has a few more grisly details than the movie, and some failed search-and-rescue details, and maybe a bit more character depth as well, but this is one instance where the movie is nearly as good as the book. Unfortunately, the money apparently ran out near the end of the production, and the ending was a bit rushed and wrapped up just a bit too nicely, when in fact it was an arduous and tortuous experience down the mountain by the 2 men.If you think YOU have it bad, watch this movie or read the book.

341659,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302868874,Lawyeraau,"[23, 27]","This 1993 docudrama capably illustrates the plight of those who were on the plane that crashed in the Andes mountains in October 1972. A Uruguayan rugby team, their friends, and relatives had chartered a plane to fly them from Montevideo, Uruguay to Santiago, Chile for a rugby match. Forty five people went down with the plane, high up in the Andes mountains. Seventy days later, only sixteen of them were still alive. This film is the story of their struggle to survive and the lengths to which they went to ensure that they would.The film was done in collaboration with some of the original survivors in order to lend authenticity of detail to the film. The filmmakers tried to recreate the experiences of those who were trapped in the mountains and were forced to resort to anthropophagy in order to survive. It is a well made film, which attempts to depict the ordeal of those who were on that ill fated flight. It pretty much follows the events outlined in the book of the same name by Piers Paul Read.The movie has breathtaking scenery of snow capped mountains. The crash of the plane is one of the most harrowing on film. The treatment of the issue of anthropophagy is not sensationalized and is grounded in the context of the faith of those who were on that fateful flight. All in all, the film is a well made and well cast accolade to the endurance and faith of those who were on that ill fated flight and struggled to survive, despite the odds against them.

Unable to overcome their situation any other way, the survivors are forced to contemplate the unthinkable - to eat the dead...Though the cannibalism aspect of this extraordinary true story had formed the backbone of an earlier exploitation movie (Ren&eacute; Cardona's opportunistic Mexican thriller SURVIVE! [1976]), Frank Marshall's dignified Hollywood version takes its cue from Piers Paul Read's bestselling literary account and places a deliberate emphasis on the survivors' spiritual response to their circumstances. Opening with a horrific plane crash (an effects tour de force) which locates the audience at the heart of an appalling catastrophe, the script - by John Patrick Shanley (ARACHNOPHOBIA) - manages to keep repetition at bay by foregrounding a series of moral dilemmas (food rationing, medical priorities, the will to survive at all costs, etc.), though Shanley's dialogue often resorts to speech-bubble platitudes (""If we do this [ie. eat the dead], we'll never be the same again"") which sounds a little forced and unrealistic.Handsomely mounted on location in the Canadian Rockies, the film is toplined by some of Hollywood's brightest (and most photogenic) young talents, including Ethan Hawke (DEAD POETS SOCIETY), Josh Hamilton (THE HOUSE OF YES) and Vincent Spano (CITY OF HOPE), with capable support from Jack Noseworthy (CECIL B. DEMENTED), John Haymes Newton (TV's ""Superboy""!), and Illeana Douglas (GRACE OF MY HEART) as one of the few female survivors of the initial disaster. Though pretentious at times, and perhaps a little too leisurely for its own good, the movie pays tribute to the power of the human spirit and is often deeply moving. Beautiful score by James Newton Howard (M. Night Shyamalan's composer of choice), with a haunting interpretation of 'Ave Maria'  - sung by Aaron Neville - during the final credits.NB. A similar tragedy befell the so-called 'Donner party' - a group of travellers seeking a new life in California - who became stranded in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the harsh winter of 1846-47 and were forced to cannibalise their dead comrades. Movie adaptations include an excellent feature documentary (THE DONNER PARTY [1992]) by historian Ric Burns in the manner of his acclaimed TV series ""The Civil War"" (1990), and a sanitized Disney version (ONE MORE MOUNTAIN) helmed by veteran director Dick Lowry in 1994.",4,Dignified account of true events,1048291200,"03 22, 2003",2003,2602,"['ALIVE', 'USA', '1992', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'DigitalIn', '1972', 'members', 'Uruguayan', 'rugby', 'team', 'are', 'trapped', 'Andes', 'when', 'charter', 'plane', 'crashes', 'mountains', 'killing', 'many', 'board', 'Unable', 'overcome', 'situation', 'other', 'way', 'survivors', 'are', 'forced', 'contemplate', 'unthinkable', 'eat', 'dead', 'cannibalism', 'aspect', 'extraordinary', 'true', 'story', 'had', 'formed', 'backbone', 'earlier', 'exploitation', 'movie', 'Ren', 'eacute', 'Cardona', 'opportunistic', 'Mexican', 'thriller', 'SURVIVE', '[', '1976', ']', 'Frank', 'Marshall', 'dignified', 'Hollywood', 'version', 'cue', 'Piers', 'Paul', 'Read', 'bestselling', 'literary', 'account', 'deliberate', 'emphasis', 'survivors', 'spiritual', 'response', 'circumstances', 'Opening', 'horrific', 'plane', 'crash', 'effects', 'tour', 'force', 'audience', 'heart', 'appalling', 'catastrophe', 'script', 'John', 'Patrick', 'Shanley', 'ARACHNOPHOBIA', 'keep', 'repetition', 'bay', 'foregrounding', 'series', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'food', 'rationing', 'medical', 'priorities', 'will', 'survive', 'costs', 'etc', 'Shanley', 'dialogue', 'often', 'speech-bubble', 'platitudes', 'do', '[', 'ie', 'eat', 'dead', ']', ""'ll"", 'never', 'be', 'same', 'again', 'little', 'forced', 'unrealistic.Handsomely', 'mounted', 'location', 'Canadian', 'Rockies', 'film', 'toplined', 'Hollywood', 'brightest', 'most', 'photogenic', 'young', 'talents', 'including', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'DEAD', 'POETS', 'SOCIETY', 'Josh', 'Hamilton', 'THE', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'YES', 'Vincent', 'Spano', 'CITY', 'OF', 'HOPE', 'capable', 'support', 'Jack', 'Noseworthy', 'CECIL', 'B.', 'DEMENTED', 'John', 'Haymes', 'Newton', 'TV', 'Superboy', 'Illeana', 'Douglas', 'GRACE', 'OF', 'MY', 'HEART', 'one', 'few', 'female', 'survivors', 'initial', 'disaster', 'pretentious', 'times', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'leisurely', 'own', 'good', 'movie', 'tribute', 'power', 'human', 'spirit', 'often', 'deeply', 'moving', 'Beautiful', 'score', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'M.', 'Night', 'Shyamalan', 'composer', 'choice', 'haunting', 'interpretation', ""'Ave"", 'Maria', 'sung', 'Aaron', 'Neville', 'final', 'credits.NB', 'similar', 'tragedy', 'so-called', ""'Donner"", 'party', 'group', 'travellers', 'seeking', 'new', 'life', 'California', 'who', 'became', 'stranded', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'harsh', 'winter', '1846-47', 'were', 'forced', 'cannibalise', 'dead', 'comrades', 'Movie', 'adaptations', 'include', 'excellent', 'feature', 'documentary', 'THE', 'DONNER', 'PARTY', '[', '1992', ']', 'historian', 'Ric', 'Burns', 'manner', 'acclaimed', 'TV', 'series', 'Civil', 'War', '1990', 'sanitized', 'Disney', 'version', 'ONE', 'MORE', 'MOUNTAIN', 'helmed', 'veteran', 'director', 'Dick', 'Lowry', '1994']",N/A

This is not a film about cannibalism. The few scenes that explore this part of the group's survival, focus on the moral dilemma of cannibalism vs. starvation and death. The film doesn't gloss over this portion of the story, but handles it forthrightly and with dignity.The rest of the film is beautiful. It could have easily descended into a made-for-TV maudlin tale of brave survivors fighting the odds, but it doesn't. It is a story about bravery, perseverance, and teamwork, and it addresses these things so eloquently, that I'm left feeling no one should make another film about &quot;the human spirit,&quot; because this film says it all, and does it so well. In fact, I'd like to erase all the cloying films about personal triumph, and make this film the sole bearer of that theme.Part of the film's brilliance is the cinematography. The camera takes an active part in telling the story, with inspired shots and angles.The ensemble cast gets credit for the rest of it. Films with ensemble casts often sink under the weight of all the actors, but this film does not. This is one of the best films that doesn't have a star, but relies on the totality of talent available. With so many characters, you might think you'll need a scorecard to keep track, but you don't.

However, I was stuck for a week in Norway, and this film came on, so I watched it.It was a lot better than I thought it would be.  It's not a story of mad cannibals, but a serious story of survival and engineering your own rescue when the world had all but forgotten you.Ethan Hawke and Vincent Spano star in this film that realistically recreates the terrible crash in the Andes of the Uruguayan rugby team.  Most of the passengers and all of the crew are killed on impact, or die soon after.  Their bodies quickly freeze in the violently cold conditions high in the mountains.  The story of the survivors, and how they improvised their own survival are nothing short of miraculous.I was pleasantly surprised I enjoyed the movie so much.

I love movies dealing with this topic. The movie begins with: ""1972, A South American rugby team, together with some friends and relatives crosses the Andes to play a game in neighboring Chile.""They never arrive at their destination...or do they?The anthropography (a branch of anthropology dealing with the distribution of man as distinguished by physical character, language, institutions, and customs) is one of the best developed I have ever seen in a movie. (Bravo to Frank Marshall!) This is one of the things I love most about the movie--watching the interactions with each other. I feel as if I know each one. All emotion and soul is bared here, from the deep love and brotherhood to the frustration and anger they feel. They survived many trials besides the plane crash and starvation which I will save for you to see. What impresses me most besides their will to fight and survive, is how, through it all, they kept God with them--through prayer and in their hearts.I have watched ALIVE countless times and wondered if I were one of them who would I have been? Obviously Nando (Hawke) I considered first, as well as the medical student and his fellow climber, Roberto Canessa. But I must say that Carlitos, is my favorite character and the one closest to my heart. With his remorse (""I yelled at her...God forgive me!"") prayers (he led the group each night in Hail Mary), his humor (""Hey, I'll pay for the pizza if you go and get it!""), his spirituality (""Do you feel it?"" What? ""God. God is everywhere today."") his love (""I love you all so much.""/""God bless you all."") and hope (""I had a dream last night, a tremendous premonition. I saw green fields and flowers--I could smell the grass. Your expedition WILL SUCCEED."")There is so much to learn and take with you watching this movie. Alive is a story that was destined to be told. My highest recommendation and 10/10 stars.Soar!Additional comments: ""This film is dedicated to the 29 who died and the 16 who survived.""The music by James Newton Howard is the closest to perfect there can be for this movie. I especially love ""Ava Maria"" playing on the end credits. I must have this score. If anyone can help, please email me.Do watch the all special features such as ""Alive 20 Years Later"" and two others. I deeply respect the actual survivors sharing their story with us and wish to say a heartfelt thank you.

341676,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,6302868874,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[1, 1]","""Alive"" tells the true story of a plane that was chartered by a Uruguagan rugby team that crashed in the Andes mountains in South America in 1972. The movie follows the survivors over a two month period where they struggled to survive without water, food, and heat and their attempts to make it out of a living hell. Many of these survivors eventually realized the only way they were going to survive was too engage in cannibalism by eating the bodies of the dead people who didn't make it.The crash of the plane happens during the first moments of the movie and it is extremely well-done and produced and it gives the viewer an insight to those final moments as to what happened before the fatal crash. Graphically depicted, after watching the plane crash it makes me timid to ever fly again.""Alive"" was based on Piers Paul Reed's book ""Alive"" The Story of The Andes Survivors"" in which he conducted thorough interviews with the remaining survivors of this horrific incident.This was Ethan Hawke's first majot film role and most, if not all, of the cast is first-rate. Their portrayals are both convincing and heartbreaking and upon watching the film one realizes how these people survived was by having hope and faith.Bonuses on the DVD include introductions by the film's director Frank Marshall and two informative and detailed documentaries called ""Alive: 20 Years Later"" and ""Return To The Andes"" where some of the real-life survivors are interviewed.James Newton Howard, a well-known and Oscar nominated composer, scored ""Alive"" beautifully and his music adds to the dramatic aspect of the movie. Aaron Neville performs the theme to the end credits called ""Ava Maria"" which is simply hair-raising.""Alive"" was met with mixed critical reviews and was a modest hit at the boxoffice making over $36,000,000 on a $32,000,000 budget.
