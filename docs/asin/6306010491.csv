Steal is fun and benifial! Steal a Snowmobile from a bully to escape! Steal a plow truck and drive through a city! THese things are fun and theres nothing wrong with them. Nothing will happen to you either! Oh, I forgot, steal peoples pets too! Lets say you want a car to stop for you. Don't call out, simply lay in the road and wait for them to stop on a nice snow packed road! Are we having fun yet? Well make sure after you steal a plow truck to naturaly get your friends to tie up the driver! Want to change a song at an ice skating rink? No problem! Decieve the owner into leaving for a second then lock him out of his own business! then your are free to change the music to what ever you want! Problem solved! Need to tell something to someone? Simple wait for a news person to have an accident and then get infront of the camera and you can talk away! this is great! Hey kids, don't like your principal at school? wait till he is not looking and throw snow balls at him for a whole day! want to watch tv in your snow fort? Go for it! electricity is fun!

I can't believe how young Josh Peck was back then. It hasn't really been that long and he currently looks like he's ready to graduate from high school! Then again with his acting career sky-rocketing he probably should, if he hasn't already. They were also lucky enough to get (gasp!) Chevy Chase and Chris Elliott! I love Chase because of the National Lampoon's Vacation movies. The main reason I'm writing this however is because of the minds behind it. It was co-written and co-produced by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, the same ones responsible for The Adventures Of Pete & Pete, which would explain it's dark legend based humor (i.e. Snowplow Man, evil killer of snow days everywhere), and kids in charge/ adults left in the dust (snow?) nature. Infact I wouldn't be surprised if this started out as a planned series, perhaps The Adventures Of Hal & Nat, (they were the main characters), with ""Snow Day"" being the first episode. Which reminds me, two Pete & Pete actors returned for Snow Day. Iggy Pop (Mr. Mecklenburg) is now Mr. Zellweger the owner of the ice skating rink and Damian Young (Bus Driver Stu Benedict) is Principal Weaver, who is consantly being attacked with snowballs. I have found many other Pete & Pete overtones in Snow Day as well. How many can you find? Surprisingly I only gave this three stars while I scored Pete & Pete a perfect five. Snow Day is pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. It's good for a deep snowy day if you want to stay inside. Grab a hot coco make yourself comfortable and enjoy. You're sure to get a good laugh. (Update 1/17/07) Here's irony for you, I just found out that this was originaly planned to be the Pete & Pete movie.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[1, 2]","I saw snow day a few years ago as soon as it came out and even at that young age the movie made me say unrealistic and i mean so unrealistic that it should be titled unrealistic snow day. To me snow day was a really good movie for a good period of its running time but things hit rock bottom at a certain part. This movie follows many other predictable story lines from other teen movies before it. Its basically a guy who is a loser in school and has been in love with the most popular girl in school since grade school but there's a bump in the road that will not surprise anybody. And what is the bump you ask how about his best friend is a girl he also grew up with so i dont think i have to explain, actually if you have seen (can't hardly wait) then you have seen this except this is the kiddy version and there are too many movies like cant hardly wait so why would we want another one. Its very confusing watching this cause the popular girl is actually not evil she is very nice and this kid works hard the entire movie to get her to notice him and even better get her to fall in love with him and then sorry i dont wanna give it all away.

That's a giant LOAD!!!! The Adventures of Pete & Pete is my all time favorite show, and I recently read this movie was meant to be a Pete & Pete movie. But this film came about when Nickelodeon had lost it's mind and tried to appeal to teenage audiences. Oh sure you could say it has the elements of the show, but hardly any. The soundtrack for this movie sucks compaired to what Pete & Pete gave us. What is the deal with that song ""Another Dumb Blonde"" by Hoku? It has nothing to do with the movie whatsoever, yet they have it as the main song and it's just a terrible song. Pete & Pete was like an alternative rock show, this movie is a commercialized mess. I can't believe some actors from Pete & Pete would even participate in this. The narration is nothing like the show, for starters it's just narration, no cut to the protagonist looking at the camera. The child actors are worthless, they have none of the charms of stars Michael Maronna (Big Pete) and Danny Tamberelli (Little Pete) or any of the kid actors that appeared on the show over the seasons.

Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, just below average.Firstly, you can't tell who the main character is because the plots are all put together so badly you can hardly tell which is the main plot.

For example, the &quot;snowplow man&quot; is a complete jerk, and you have to dislike Hal (the older brother) in some way because he left his younger sister alone just so he could find the most popular girl in school. (whom he later rejects.)Secondly, I really think that if this was supposed to be a kids movie, they could have cut out the cuss words in the movie...this is a kids movie, not an adult movie! Parents may have questioned taking their children to it.Thirdly, the content of the movie itself was not done well. All the jokes the actors made were corny and old, some of the characters were played horribly, and the plots were boring and did not offer us engaging characters to really follow throughout the movie.Overall?

I think the Law and Order episode he guest-starred in was funnier than this.  Why did Zena Grey, the person we arguably see the most of, show up ninth in the cast list (at least on the film's wikipedia page)?  How much restraint did Chris Elliott have to use to keep this film kid-friendly?  All these questions remain unanswered.  But for all its faults and unanswered questions, this film can be fun to watch on...well, a snow day.  Zena Grey and her band of mischievous but determined children seek to extend an unexpected snow day by preventing the ""evil"" snow plow driver (Chris Elliott with a crow) from clearing the streets and keeping those big yellow busses from getting through.  Meanwhile, Gray's older brother and the film's narrator, a ""duel role"" played by Mark Webber, tries to get the girl of his dreams, played by Emmanuelle Chriqui, with the aide of his best friend, played by Schuyler Fisk, who is love-struck herself.  This film has some laughs, especially when Chris Elliott is at his hammiest behind the wheel of his snowplow.  Some things seem off (i.e. the principal being pelted with snowballs no matter where he is...literally), but it's a kids' movie, so I'll let stuff like that go for the most part...I do wonder why the schools closed when the snow could easily be walked through for the most part.  The only tall piles that appeared were made by the snowplow.  I'm from New York and I've gone to school in worse conditions than this.  Also, how did the kids have that, seemingly high-tech snow fort all set up and well-stocked?  The snowstorm was pretty unexpected...not a lot of time to prepare.

Have we swallowed Hollywood's drivel so faithfully that they can pawn this off on us as a decent effort? As my caption suggests, I was literally insulted by the &quot;plots&quot; on this film.The premise is great. I lived for snow days when I was young. And it was the premise that got me out to see it. Well, that and Chevy Chase. But Chase hasn't done a watchable film since ""Christmas Vacation"". I keep hoping he'll break whatever slump he's in, and this movie WAS better than his other recent efforts.But the weakness of ""Snowday"" is not in the acting. I mean, the acting is not stellar by any standard, but you don't really expect it to be in this kind of film. You just want to be entertained. However, in order to entertain, a film  - ANY film, including low-ball comedies like this - must have 1) a discernible protagonist, 2) a shred of believability, and 3) likeable characters. ""Snowday"" is lacking in the above categories.The &quot;protagonist&quot; is an adolescent boy who only wants to date the most popular girl in school. In doing so he shuns his adorable little sister and his best friends. He pursues the popular girl, and against the odds, she falls for him and even makes the move to kiss him.Sound good? Here are a few problems. First, this popular girl is an absolute sweetheart. She's been mistreated and ignored by a jerk boyfriend for too long. You feel bad for her. You really like her. As a result, you WANT them to end up together. But of course, they don't. After the kiss, in a moment of clarity, our hero realizes that he is in love with his quite unattractive, redheaded lifelong pal. The writers made the fatal flaw in this plot line of making us LIKE the popular girl. She had no flaws and you feel bad for her, so as a result you're actually MAD at the hero when he rejects her.Also, there are many storylines that just aren't woven together well. We're not sure who the main character is supposed to be (it doesn't seem to be the narrator - the adolescent older brother - since his story is in the background). The problem is that they did not focus enough on the &quot;fun&quot; aspect of this film, the snow day itself. They spent too much time on this kid trying to get this popular girl (whom he then rejects) and that had NOTHING to do with a snow day, other than the mantra he kept repeating, &quot;Anything can happen on a snow day...&quot; It could have been any day of the week.I suppose kids will like it, but even kids should have the basic elements of a good story presented to them.",2,Insulting,974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,2585,"['what', ""'ve"", 'come', 'accept', 'good', 'picture', 'Have', 'swallowed', 'Hollywood', 'drivel', 'so', 'faithfully', 'can', 'pawn', 'off', 'decent', 'effort', 'caption', 'was', 'literally', 'insulted', 'quot', 'quot', 'film.The', 'premise', 'great', 'lived', 'snow', 'days', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'premise', 'got', 'see', 'Well', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Chase', ""n't"", 'done', 'watchable', 'film', 'Christmas', 'Vacation', 'keep', 'hoping', ""'ll"", 'break', 'slump', 'movie', 'WAS', 'better', 'other', 'recent', 'weakness', 'Snowday', 'not', 'acting', 'mean', 'acting', 'not', 'stellar', 'standard', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'be', 'kind', 'film', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'entertained', 'However', 'order', 'entertain', 'film', 'ANY', 'film', 'including', 'low-ball', 'comedies', 'must', 'have', '1', 'discernible', 'protagonist', '2', 'shred', 'believability', '3', 'likeable', 'characters', 'Snowday', 'lacking', 'categories.The', 'quot', 'protagonist', 'quot', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'who', 'only', 'date', 'most', 'popular', 'girl', 'school', 'doing', 'so', 'adorable', 'little', 'sister', 'best', 'friends', 'popular', 'girl', 'odds', 'even', 'move', 'kiss', 'him.Sound', 'good', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'problems', 'First', 'popular', 'girl', 'absolute', 'sweetheart', 'been', 'mistreated', 'ignored', 'jerk', 'boyfriend', 'too', 'long', 'feel', 'bad', 'really', 'result', 'WANT', 'end', 'up', 'together', 'course', 'do', ""n't"", 'kiss', 'moment', 'clarity', 'hero', 'love', 'quite', 'unattractive', 'redheaded', 'lifelong', 'pal', 'writers', 'made', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'plot', 'line', 'making', 'popular', 'girl', 'had', 'flaws', 'feel', 'bad', 'so', 'result', ""'re"", 'actually', 'MAD', 'hero', 'when', 'her.Also', 'are', 'many', 'storylines', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'woven', 'together', 'well', ""'re"", 'not', 'sure', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'narrator', 'adolescent', 'older', 'brother', 'story', 'background', 'problem', 'did', 'not', 'focus', 'enough', 'quot', 'fun', 'quot', 'aspect', 'film', 'snow', 'day', 'spent', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'kid', 'trying', 'get', 'popular', 'girl', 'whom', 'then', 'had', 'NOTHING', 'do', 'snow', 'day', 'other', 'mantra', 'kept', 'repeating', 'quot', 'Anything', 'can', 'happen', 'snow', 'day', 'quot', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'day', 'week.I', 'suppose', 'kids', 'will', 'like', 'even', 'kids', 'should', 'have', 'basic', 'elements', 'good', 'story', 'presented']",N/A

486502,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,6306010491,Stephen Verhaeren,"[1, 3]","If you are wondering what the pro and con of a Snow Day are. Then here they are. The pro is you get a day off from school. The con is that you will have to go back 2 to school at the end of the year to make up for the Snow Day(s). But suppose if you worked a job (other than being a teacher or other staff member at a school), I'm not sure on how it would be worked if they had to close for a snow day to. In Snow Day there are kids, teenagers and adults who are rivals for what they want. The kids want to enjoy the snow day, but their rival is the evial snowplowman (Chris Elliot). There's a high school student named Hal (Mark Webber) who has now a new girlfreind that seems to don't know that he lives. And he has to go up against her ex-boyfriend (David Paetkau) to win her. While his dad Tom Brandson (Chevy Chase) who wants to wear pants while he does the wheather but his boss (Pam Grier) that tells him to get the rating of his rival and she will let him wear pants on the air.My thoughts on Snow Day are, that if you like movies with people going up against rivals and enjoyed Snow Day, I reccomend you to watch Max Keeble's Big Move. Watching Chevy Chase playing a whatherman who wears costumes on air reminds me of Max Keeble's dad. Because Max's dad had to wear costumes to work at times. My Suggestions: Parents if your kids want to watch a film, I reccomend you to know what the rating is. And toi watch the film ahead of time and decide to let your kids watch a film that doesn't have a G rating (like this). Snow Day is a good movie to watch if you like movies in which characters go up against thier &quot;rivals&quot; to get what they want like this and Max Keeble's Big Move.
