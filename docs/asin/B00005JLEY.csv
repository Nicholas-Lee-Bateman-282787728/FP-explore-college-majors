Sure, everyone talks about the clothes, Don Johnson's stubble and the Ferarri Daytona, but what made the show for me was its offbeat quality.The early episodes had a quirkiness, a looseness, about them that didn't seem as forced or pretentious as later seasons did, and the overall chemistry of the cast was perfect.  Take the characters of Crockett and Tubbs for instance.  There was the sense of a somewhat easy-going, equal partnership in the inaugural season that became more unbalanced in later years with Crockett becoming the focus of the story 99 percent of the time. Tubbs gradually went from being ""Tough, Unique, Bad, Bold, Sassy"" ( Hope fans get the reference) to a boring stiff.  The show started out as  Miami Vice and became  The Don Johnson Show.It was too bad.There were some excellently written episodes in year 1  that not only focused on the two leads but highlighted the supporting cast as well, i.e. "" Made for Each Other"" featuring Switek and Zito, ""The Golden Triangle,"" pts 1 and 2 with the foculs on Lt. Castillo and ""Give a Little, Take a Little,"" a story highlighting Gina and Trudy.If you don't believe my praise of the Crockett and Tubbs partnership in the first year, just take a look at episodes such as the series pilot, ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""Cool Runnin"" ""Return of Calderone 1 (aka 'Hit List') and 2"" (aka 'Calderone's Demise'), ""Glades,"" ""Smugglers Blues,"" ""Milk Run,"" and ""Evan."" Compare the writing, pacing and the chemistry of the leads in the first season to year 2 and tell me if I am wrong.The second season wasn't as bad as later years, but it paled in comparison to the inaugural year where Vice hit TV like a shot from Crockett's Bren 10 and influenced everything from clothes, to shaving habits.  But, that's my humble opinion.",5,First Year Was the Best,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1823,"['Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'season', 'Sure', 'everyone', 'talks', 'clothes', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'stubble', 'Ferarri', 'Daytona', 'what', 'made', 'show', 'was', 'offbeat', 'quality.The', 'early', 'episodes', 'had', 'quirkiness', 'looseness', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'as', 'forced', 'pretentious', 'later', 'seasons', 'did', 'overall', 'chemistry', 'cast', 'was', 'perfect', 'Take', 'characters', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'instance', 'was', 'sense', 'somewhat', 'easy-going', 'equal', 'partnership', 'inaugural', 'season', 'became', 'more', 'unbalanced', 'later', 'years', 'Crockett', 'becoming', 'focus', 'story', '99', 'percent', 'time', 'Tubbs', 'gradually', 'went', 'being', 'Tough', 'Unique', 'Bad', 'Bold', 'Sassy', 'Hope', 'fans', 'get', 'reference', 'boring', 'stiff', 'show', 'started', 'out', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'became', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Show.It', 'was', 'too', 'bad.There', 'were', 'excellently', 'written', 'episodes', 'year', '1', 'not', 'only', 'focused', 'two', 'leads', 'highlighted', 'supporting', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'i.e.', 'Made', 'Other', 'featuring', 'Switek', 'Zito', 'Golden', 'Triangle', '1', '2', 'foculs', 'Lt.', 'Castillo', 'Give', 'Little', 'Take', 'Little', 'story', 'highlighting', 'Gina', 'Trudy.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'praise', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'partnership', 'first', 'year', 'just', 'take', 'look', 'episodes', 'such', 'series', 'pilot', 'Heart', 'Darkness', 'Cool', 'Runnin', 'Return', 'Calderone', '1', 'aka', 'List', '2', ""'Calderone"", 'Demise', 'Glades', 'Smugglers', 'Blues', 'Milk', 'Run', 'Evan', 'Compare', 'writing', 'pacing', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'first', 'season', 'year', '2', 'tell', 'am', 'wrong.The', 'second', 'season', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'later', 'years', 'paled', 'comparison', 'inaugural', 'year', 'where', 'Vice', 'hit', 'TV', 'shot', 'Crockett', 'Bren', '10', 'influenced', 'everything', 'clothes', 'shaving', 'habits', 'humble', 'opinion']",Miami Vice: Season One

This was years ago, then I was in a video store and saw a copy of season one and I got it right on the spot to see how well the videogame was compared to the TV show itself. I opened the box and I saw my first pet peeve of DVDs. They were double-sided. That is just something I really hate because you have to watch out on either side of the disc. Second, the DVD loaded well and I started to play the first episode. The editing wasn't good at all the frame would freeze and somebody would still be talking or finish their sentence. Other than that annoyance (which goes away as the season goes on) the show gets better and better. The plots are kind of repetitive (cocaine, cocaine and more cocaine) but since cocaine was really big in Miami in the 1980s, I can understand that repetitive plot. The special features aren't really worth it, but they have a few interesting points.

After watching all the episodes on this DVD (Season 1), I almost shed a tear. The music sounds brilliant if you have surrond sond with a sub. If you have a larger TV with HD/Digital inputs you will notice dirt/flakes during the theme song. Universal/MCA obviously didnt consult George Lucas on how to digitally correct an old film ( See Star Wars Episode 4). Also, some episodes are crisper then others.My favourite episodes are Smuglers Blues (Glen Frey rocks) and Rites of Passage ( where we see some model/hooker on the show do enough blow to ski down).  I did find it hard to stomach watching Al Bundy kick the crap out of some deadbeat in episode 2 or 3.  My biggest complaint on the original show is how wimpy the guns sounded.  Crockets Berretta and Tubs shotgun sound like firecrackers, thankfully Universal has enhanced the sounds on some of gun battles.Also, some of the scenes are longer then the rereleases to cable in the 90's. Don Johnson is the coolest hetrosexual male ever to wear pastel shirts and  pants. And,  if all of Crockets clothes are seized from Govt drug seizures, whose the drug dealer that had like 40 Versace/Gucci outfits that fit Crocket exactly.

Sometimes shows we remember from our youth turn out to be awful when we watch them as an adult.  Not so with this show.  It's still great, beyond just the memories of youth.Consider Michael Mann's recent films - Collateral and Heat - and you'll trace the same thing back to Miami Vice.  Everything is meticulously choreographed and filmed.  It still has a hip feel to it, even though it is very much 80s (wait 'til you see the dancing at the parties!).It's great in retrospect to watch the development of the characters and the actors in those roles.  You can literally watch Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas become Crockett and Tubbs.  The minor characters also develop into their irrespective roles, especially Edward James Olmos as Castillo.  Olmos is the one who added the dark edge to what was potentially riding the cusp of taking the comic edge just a bit too far.And the music!  Come on, let's face it, the music made the show.  Along with Phil Collins' 'In the Air Tonight' in the Pilot there is Russ Ballard's 'Voices' as Crockett and Tubbs head to the Bahamas to take on Calderone and Glenn Frey's 'Smuggler's Blues'.  The big deal in school on Monday was to talk about what song was on Miami Vice and how it was used.Riding on the tails of MTV and the video generation, Miami Vice defined a generation of television in the course of its too brief life.  Hard to believe it's been twenty years.  It still looks and sounds as hip as it was then.It's a reasonably priced boxed set.  There are a few extras but nothing overly special there.

599064,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00005JLEY,Austin Somlo,"[3, 3]","I remember Miami Vice like it was yesterday. TV shows come and go, but there is nothing like Miami Vice. Its influence during the 80's and onward was enormous, and television was never the same afterwards. Neither was how we looked at pop culture anymore. The style...the cars...the clothes...the music...the way people talked and acted...all were directly attributed to Miami Vice. This was the genius of Michael Mann's vision. He made great films, and he was influenced by his imprint on that television show. He made sure that the authenticity of the Miami locale would be extensively used in every and each episode. Amazingly enough, nearly every one of them contained future Who's Who of Hollywood: Jimmy Smits, Bruce Willis, Ed O'Neill, Michael Madsen, Dennis Farina, Pam Grier, John Turturro, Esai Morales, Ving Rhames, Eric Bogosian, Dan Hedaya, Tony Plana, Joe Dallesandro (more of the past as part of Andy Warhol's company), and Joan Chen. Miami Vice may still hold the distinction of being the only show ever to have three actors in the very first seven episodes to die and go on to become the leading actor of a future wildly popular sitcom show. Finally, we come to the best parts of the show: Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. They were both very, very cool characters. It's not often that a character like Sonny that cares deeply about his job and code of morals and ethics. But goodness, he smoked cigarettes way, way too much. Philip Michael Thomas brought a whole new level to the show that defines the word ""hip."" He was just...cool. Brilliantly done was the performance of the entire cast. They made it gritty as possible: Saundra Santiago, Olivia Brown, John Diehl, and Michael Talbott. The best part in making a cast change was getting rid of the former boss and replacing him with Edward James Olmos; he was just awesome and a tough-nosed guy with the cool 'tache. Why I loved watching Miami Vice during the 80s and still do today is because of how incredible the storylines and the action were. It is a film noir heaven. Everything was beautifully executed and detailed, and everybody went great lengths to make it all happen. The only complaint I have with the show is the lack of blood which would have made it more realistic, that's all. One another thing to mention: I am used to seeing reruns of television shows on DVD, and I always fast forward the opening credits of every episode, but Miami Vice, I never do...it's essentially one of the best intros ever put together next to Hawaii Five-O and The Twilight Zone. I am looking forward to more episodes of Season Two.

It was definitely worth the wait to have all 22 episodes with original music included in the episodes along with episode synopsies and original air dates.  Hard episodes  to find such as  The Great McCarthy, One Eyed Jack, and The Maze ar all here for the Vice fan, like me, to enjoy. It can be Friday night at 9 PM whenever I want  I am only disappointed with the set in two ways.First, I wish Universal took the time to track down the original actors or other crew to do commentary on the pilot episode  It would have been nice to hear their thoughts & behind the scenes stories almost 20 years later.  I wish they had done in depth interviews with Switek(Sp?) and Zitto, or the actors who played the confidential informants Noogie, and Izzy.Second, the Special Features don't really add much to the set, except for the featurette with Jan Hammer, the musical genius behind the show.  It's definetly worth the extra shipping money I spent to get it here.According to an article I read on tvshowsondvd.com Universal might swap Vice's music for cheaper tracks in subsequent seasons to cut costs.  Columbia House did this with a few episodes when I bought them on tape, and they weren't the same episodes.  Let's all hope and pray that after the revenue from the sale of the Season One DVD comes in that Universal DOES NOT! cave in to the cost pressure.  My world is now complete.

599067,A3727MCK7JQR18,B00005JLEY,"BlueCross Boss ""Blue""","[4, 29]","The best cop show of the 80's was 'Hill Street Blues'. 'Miami Vice' was ground breaking in terms of production values. The nostalgia of the Miami Vice music videos - which like it or not seemed to dominate my life in the 80's as I couldn't get away from Vice and MTV jamming some no talent bums like 'Asia' or 'Men at Work' down my throat - is the only value I see in this set. As far as characters and story lines forget it. Miami Vice was weak on acting, writing, directing, producing but big on music videos and explosions. Look elsewhere. Hill Street Blues is the cop show with the most award winning writers, actors, directors, producers, everything a great TV show is supposed to be. Miami Vice was 80's excess, fluff, MTV. Yuk! Watching this stuff again makes me sick. Most of the pop music chosen for Miami Vice is horrible. Glen Frey's 'Smuggler Blues'? Phil Collin's 'Something in the Air'? Gimme a break.

First of all, kudos to the people who put this out as they throw on five different extras all of which give us a good look at how music and fashion were an integral part of the show as well as how the show incorporated its setting (Miami and all of South Florida) into the show. There's also some great interview clips off the ""Today"" show with the cast. Toss in bits with Jan hammer who did the signature soundtracks to each episode and the extras really are worth the price of this DVD.The transfer to DVD is very good. The series still oozes that ""pastel and art deco meets the dark underbelly of Miami"" feel to it. At times some of the episodes do suffer from the wrap it all up in an hour arc of network TV.On this set you get the two-hour pilot which has Jimmy Smits (say what?) as Crockett's partner. I won't give anything away but Tubbs shows up in the pilot. Also, Crockett's boss in the pilot is Gregory Sierra. James Edward Olmos takes over later in the first season. Anyway, just FYI, guest stars that first season included Bruce Willis (with hair!), the Eagles' Glenn Frey, the aforementioned Dennis Farina, Joan Chen, Hawaii 5-0's Keye Luke and Pam Grier.There's also the famous Switek and Zito (the other two less-sartorially splendored cops in the vice squad) episode which is as hilarious as I remembered it.You may not be into watching the entire season as it does have its excellent and duff episodes and I found myself picking and choosing.

George,"[8, 9]","Though I've only watched two episodes on this DVD set thus far (the pilot episode and ""Smuggler's Blues""), I think I can safely write a review for ""Miami Vice:Season One"". There's no doubt that ""Miami Vice"" was an influential slice of 80's culture; however, Season One is by far the best season of the show. As much as I loved the first season, the second season quickly became formulaic, and by the third season, I had stopped watching altogether. So, should Universal Studios decide to release subsequent seasons of the show, I doubt I'll buy them.Which brings me to other issues. First, Universal has once again done a poor job with the video transfer. Of the two episodes I've watched, neither look great, though nighttime scenes appear to be clearer. Universal just seems to rush the product out for a quick buck, without much concern on video quality. If anyone has seen the DVD's of ""Animal House"", ""The Breakfast Club"" or any other pre-90's film or show distributed by Universal, you know I am correct in my arguement. I will say that keeping the original music for each episode intact is a major coup-de-gras, though Universal probably recognized that the DVD wouldn't have much selling value without it.Another problem, again probably demonstrated by the make-a-quick-buck mentality at Universal, is a complete lack of interviews with cast members. I'd like to know the opinions of Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas, and Edward James Olmos, among others, and what it meant for them to be part of such a groundbreaking program. No such luck. What is offered are a few words from series creator Anthony Yerkovich, and some old ""Today"" show interviews. There are a couple of nice nuggets, though. I was surprised to learn that the show was nominated for 15 Emmys in it's first season, and also that NBC did not want Don Johnson to be part of the show, as he had previously starred in six failed TV pilots. Nonetheless, the bonus material could have been much more comprehensive.""Miami Vice"" is rumored to be returning to the big screen in 2006, so it's obvious that it's appeal has sustained for the last 20 years. This DVD of Season One will hopefully introduce a younger generation to it's ""coolness"", though I hope Universal will do a better job with later seasons. I'm rating the DVD four stars for the show content, but the extras need help.

599083,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B00005JLEY,Dorrie Wheeler,"[4, 5]","The first season of Miami Vice is now on DVD. The set includes 22 episodes from the first season. The hour long episodes are included on 3 dual sided discs. The DVD set does include the original music from the series. There have been several early reviews posted saying that the original music was not there, perhaps these were very early advance copies before all of the clearances were finished, but on the final DVD set all of the music is included. I did notice that the version of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" played in the pilot episode does not feature Cyndi Lauper on the vocals. However, the Cyndi Lauper on vocals version of ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" wasn't included in the movie ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" either. The music from season one include popular songs like ""Missing You"" by John Waits, ""In The Air Tonight,"" by ""Relax"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. To my knowledge, all of the original music is included.No hour long series captures the mid 80's like Miami Vice.Miami Vice broke a lot of stars into the industry. Jimmy Smits appeared in the pilot episode. The show also made stars out of a lot of actors who had been struggling to make it big for some time. Phillip Michael Thomas and Don Johnson were not household names prior to the show. The first season also gave Gregory Sierra his first major non-sitcom television role. Prior to Vice he had was best known as Julio on Sanford and Son The guest stars in the first season are equally impressive. Ed O'Neil stars in episode two in a serious role. Ed later went on to star as Al Bundy on Married With Children. Other season one guests include Bruce Willis pre-Moonlighting, and Ving Rhames. Edward James also starts his extended run on the show during Season One.It's nice to have the show on DVD finally. The picture quality looks awesome but I do have a few personal complaints. The dual disc DVD thing wouldn't be that bad if each side were labeled. Perhaps it has to be like that, but at times I was wondering if there was content on both sides. There is another thing that really bothered me as a DVD on TV enthusiast. There is no booklet that describes what episode is on each disc. The booklet included includes previews of future and current DVD releases. This information is included on the inside back flap of the DVD box.

599092,A2YNJCI2BNF79U,B00005JLEY,"Gregory A. Beamer ""Cowboy""","[9, 14]","I have been a Vice fan from show 1 in 1984, so I was quick to get out and buy a copy. I am happy with the box set, overall, as I enjoy the show, but have a few reservations about the DVDs.First off, the transfer from film to DVD is a bit shoddy on this one. There is no clean up of film stock that has been lying around for quite some time, which is evident in the color shifts from time to time. This will probably not be very noticeable to most viewers, but caught my attention. (I have a degree in film and video, which causes me to start paying attention to technique when I lose the moment - an annoying habit, according to my wife).Second, the gaps for commercials should have been reduced or eliminated (not always possible, due to fade in). There are times when the couple of seconds feels like an eternity.About the show: Looking back, I can see I was enamored with a show that had a few logical leaps. :-) After all, how can Vice cops continue to bust such high profile people and not get fingered? But, you quickly get into the world of Vice and forget that some of it does not make perfect sense. The chemistry between the actors is what really made Vice anyway.In the first few episodes, you get to see actors' flubbed up lines make it into the show. I venture a guess that the budget was much tighter during the first season, forcing a few allowances. It gets better as the season continues, however.The episodes on the disk:1. Pilot episode (2 hours) - one of my favorites. Tubbs comes in as a New York street cop who is carrying a large sum of cash and sporting a Jamaican accent. The show has one of the better chase scenes in the season and shows how Vice's mixture of cinematography and pop music was a hit. Guest stars a very young Jimmy Smits as Crockett's first partner. Watch for the hitman, who is resurrected as Izzie, an informant, later in the season.2. Heart of Darkness - One of the weaker episodes, dealing with child pornography and a possible rogue FBI agent (played by Ed O'Neill - Married with Children).3. Cool Running - Interesting story about a group of Jamaican's knocking off buyers at drug deals. Contains one of the most annoying, yet endearing characters from the first season: Noogie.4-5. Return of Calderone I & II - Some people absolutely love this episode, but I find it rather banal. In this one, Calderone is knocking off people who have crossed him and Sonny is on the list. Crockett and Tubbs end up in the Bahamas where Tubbs falls in love with Calderone's daughter, in one of the weakest plot twists.6. One-Eyed Jack - The episode that introduces Edward James Olmos as Lt. Castillo. Denis Farina also costars.7. No Exit - A dealer is selling Stinger missles and Crockett and Tubbs must get together with the FBI to stop him.8. The Great McCarthy - Neat boat action in this smuggling story. This is the one that introduces Izzie Moreno, Crockett and Tubbs favorite informant. Fun story.9. Glades - Crockett and Tubbs search for a witness who escaped from protective custody when his daughter was kidnapped. Interesting ending in the middle of the Everglades.10. Give a Little, Take a Little - Crockett is thrown in jail for refusing to name an informant. Gina and Trudy must take down the crime boss to help get Sonny out of jail. Return of Noogie in this episode.11. Little Prince - Crockett works to give a drug dealer's son a new lease on life after Vice arrests him to get to the father.12. Milk Run - Two naive college kids get thrown into the middle of the action when they smuggle drugs into the country for a high volume dealer.13 - 14. Score and Golden Triangle - Castillo (Olmos) is brought to the forefront in this story which deals with a drug smuggling Vietnamese general who kidnapped Castillo's wife many years prior. One of the better shows of the season.15. Smuggler's Blues - Watch for Glenn Frey (singer of the song) in this episode about a group of guys who are hijacking smugglers. One of the better music blends of the season.16. Rites of Passage - A Tubbs centered episode, in which Tubbs tries to help the sister of an ex-girlfriend out of the drug and prostitution business. Look for John Turturo in this one.17. The Maze - Hostage crisis in an apartment building. Tubbs is one of the hostages and Sonny has to barge in to save his life.18. Made for Each Other - A Zito and Sweitek episode that features both Izzie and Noogie.19. The Home Invaders - The detectives get transferred to robbery for a short stint to investigate a string of home invasion robberies. Features a young Esai Morales.20. Nobody Lives Forever - Sonny's new girlfriend changes his lifestyle and almost ruins the team.21. Evan - One of the best episodes of the first season. This one deals with an over-the-edge ATF agent (former Vice cop) who nearly messes everything up in a Vice arms deal.22. Lombard - Sonny and Rico must keep an informant alive to testify.Extra Features:The transfer quality is weak, even weaker than the show, with noticeable pixelation in some of the pieces.

599098,A3R56AWX8PRQLP,B00005JLEY,Indy Reviewer,"[3, 3]","Season 1 of Miami Vice on DVD deserves praise for getting the most important aspect of the show - the soundtracks that made this (as NBC head Brandon Tartikoff put it) ""MTV Cops"" - licensed and in their original places in the series.  I'm taking off a star for less-than-robust features, so-so video transfer, and a Dolby Digital 5.1 remastering that seems only halfhearted, but this is a must for any child of the 80s.It's hard to believe its been 20 years since you had a choice of going to a lame high school party on Friday night or staying in and watching Miami Vice.  As they discuss in one of the DVD features, what's striking about season 1 is how just how bad the first 5-6 episodes were - when the show nearly got cancelled.  (I'd fortunately forgotten the highlight of them - the Sonny Crockett-Gina Calabrese relationship.  Awful.)  Only after Edward James Olmos brought his taciturn presence to boss unrestrained supercops Crockett and Tubbs and the writers started getting more outlandish with the bad guys did the pace here start picking up.  Thus, for most fans only Discs Two and Three contain the 'real' Miami Vice that you remember so fondly.  While 20 years later some of the fashion simply makes you laugh, some of the characters (the informants especially) are very non-PC and could easily make you cringe a bit.  But it's ok, that was television in the 80s; I guess the vast wasteland has progressed on some fronts.What's more important is that unlike several recent TV-to-DVD transfers (Keen Eddie being the most heartbreaking of them) the heart of the show - the soundtrack - is completely intact.  Phil Collins ""In the Air Tonight"" and Glenn Fry's ""Smuggler's Blues"" give the full aura of the chase sequences.  Unlike later years, though, the soundtrack to season 1 is mostly top 40 and didn't take a whole lot of chances.  (The Pointer Sisters ""I'm So Excited"" is not exactly cutting edge, although watching the Solid Gold dancers is worth the laugh factor.)  But props to the producers to get the licenses without a problem.The reason this is 4 stars rather than 5 is because there are a number of things that could have been better for the DVD production.  First, the three features aren't particularly meaty and it's probably worth taking off a star alone for the 'feature' that is an ad by the Miami Chamber of Commerce.  Commentary by actors or writers (several of whom certainly could use the work!) would have been cheap and easy.  Second, the video transfer is so-so.  I would have expected at least a token effort at digital cleanup, which clearly didn't take place.  Finally, the DD 5.1 remastering wasn't particularly well done.  Only in a few episodes (and the annoying race car during the video menu) do we get sound effects like gunshots and crickets out of the rear speakers where dialogue is always center channel and music always L-R.  Wouldn't have taken much effort to improve that.Still, a must have for any child of the 80s and I'm looking forward to Season Two when the series picked up.",4,"Good start, features/sound/transfer could be improved",1109894400,"03 4, 2005",2005,3036,"['Season', '1', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'DVD', 'deserves', 'praise', 'getting', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'show', 'soundtracks', 'made', 'NBC', 'head', 'Brandon', 'Tartikoff', 'put', 'MTV', 'Cops', 'licensed', 'original', 'places', 'series', ""'m"", 'taking', 'off', 'star', 'less-than-robust', 'features', 'so-so', 'video', 'transfer', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'remastering', 'only', 'halfhearted', 'must', 'child', '80s.It', 'hard', 'believe', 'been', '20', 'years', 'had', 'choice', 'going', 'lame', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'Friday', 'night', 'staying', 'watching', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'discuss', 'one', 'DVD', 'features', 'what', 'striking', 'season', '1', 'how', 'just', 'how', 'bad', 'first', '5-6', 'episodes', 'were', 'when', 'show', 'nearly', 'got', 'cancelled', ""'d"", 'fortunately', 'forgotten', 'highlight', 'Sonny', 'Crockett-Gina', 'Calabrese', 'relationship', 'Awful', 'Only', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'brought', 'taciturn', 'presence', 'boss', 'unrestrained', 'supercops', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'writers', 'started', 'getting', 'more', 'outlandish', 'bad', 'guys', 'did', 'pace', 'here', 'start', 'picking', 'up', 'Thus', 'most', 'fans', 'only', 'Discs', 'Two', 'Three', 'contain', ""'real"", 'Miami', 'Vice', 'remember', 'so', 'fondly', '20', 'years', 'later', 'fashion', 'simply', 'characters', 'informants', 'especially', 'are', 'very', 'non-PC', 'could', 'easily', 'make', 'cringe', 'bit', 'ok', 'was', 'television', '80s', 'guess', 'vast', 'wasteland', 'progressed', 'fronts.What', 'more', 'important', 'several', 'recent', 'TV-to-DVD', 'transfers', 'Keen', 'Eddie', 'being', 'most', 'heartbreaking', 'heart', 'show', 'soundtrack', 'completely', 'intact', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'Air', 'Tonight', 'Glenn', 'Fry', 'Smuggler', 'Blues', 'give', 'full', 'aura', 'chase', 'sequences', 'later', 'years', 'though', 'soundtrack', 'season', '1', 'mostly', 'top', '40', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'whole', 'lot', 'chances', 'Pointer', 'Sisters', ""'m"", 'So', 'Excited', 'not', 'exactly', 'cutting', 'edge', 'watching', 'Solid', 'Gold', 'dancers', 'laugh', 'factor', 'producers', 'get', 'licenses', 'problem.The', 'reason', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5', 'are', 'number', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'DVD', 'production', 'First', 'three', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'meaty', 'probably', 'worth', 'taking', 'off', 'star', 'alone', ""'feature"", 'ad', 'Miami', 'Chamber', 'Commerce', 'Commentary', 'actors', 'writers', 'several', 'whom', 'certainly', 'could', 'use', 'work', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cheap', 'easy', 'Second', 'video', 'transfer', 'so-so', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'least', 'token', 'effort', 'digital', 'cleanup', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'Finally', 'DD', '5.1', 'remastering', 'was', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'well', 'done', 'Only', 'few', 'episodes', 'annoying', 'race', 'car', 'video', 'menu', 'do', 'get', 'sound', 'effects', 'gunshots', 'crickets', 'rear', 'speakers', 'where', 'dialogue', 'always', 'center', 'channel', 'music', 'always', 'L-R.', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'taken', 'much', 'effort', 'improve', 'that.Still', 'must', 'have', 'child', '80s', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Season', 'Two', 'when', 'series', 'picked', 'up']",Miami Vice: Season One

It is my sincere hope that they release the DVD with= ALL THE ORIGINAL MUSIC!  The music played a major factor in the plot and theme of each episode.  To edit that would completely defeat the purpose of releasing the DVD.  I have spent many hours building and creating my own Miami Vice mix's on CD.  In my opinion, this is some of the best music of the century.  Miami Vice is still my favorite TV series of all time.  I am a Public Safety Professional who has great respect for Michael Mann and company for the fantastic job they did on the 111 episodes. Miami Vice was one of the first police series that showed the reality of "" the good guys do not always win "".In most cases of Miami Vice, in some way or another, one of the good guys usually lost, just like in real life.  Granted hollywood played a big part in the series as well, but that's the television business.  The last I have heard, Miami Vice 1st. season could be released as soon as January 2005.  I, for one, will be waiting patiently until then.  I hope they realize how important the music is for the show, and to keep it all original as this is the way it should be released.

Seeing Law & Order re-runs advertised all the time on TNT like they are something exciting makes me wish Miami Vice was still on. I was only little when it was on but now that the dvds got me into it, I see what I was missing. This is a good season but not even the best, from what I've seen from TV Land marathans this show got even better. Plus since I own season 2 and saw it recently, that's a great season too. This isn't bad at all though. You have appearences by Ed O'Neal, Bruce Willis, Dennis Farina, Jimmy Smitts and others. With music by Phil Collins and U2.Of couse since this is the beginning of the hit series, it's about 'Sonny' Crockett (Don Johnson) and Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) meeting and bonding through-out the season. At first Sonny dosn't want to team up but eventually agrees to. In the first episode they Tubbs is trying to track down the man that killed his brother. While Crockett is mourning his dead partner ""Jimmy Smitts"", who gets killed when the two are under-cover. I think 3 or 4 episodes into the series, ""maybe  more or less"" Crockett's boss gets killed and replaced by the stone cold Lt. Martin Castillo (Edward James Olmos). Olmos is great as Castillo and probably the most memorable character. Although I'm still having nightmares of the episode where he's wearing a tiny bathing suit ""shivers"" lol.Plus while no one can replace Olmos as Castillo, no one could play Crockett and Tubbs as well as Don Johnson or Philip Michael Thomas either. Oh wait they are replacing them in a new movie....lol. Colin Farrell as Crockett and...the Predator as Tubbs....oops I mean Jamie Foxx ""he just looks like the Predator lol"". I doubt they casted him on looks since...he has nothing on Philip Michael Thomas look wise and he's not like him period. Terrence Howard (Hustle and Flow) probbaly would've been a better choice although I don't think anyone would be as good as the original actors. They all grow on you and the 80's music and style grows on you too. I doubt we're gonna be hearing Phil Collins or U2 in the new movie, we're most likely just gonna get an all rap sound track. About  the only thing that makes me wanna see it is that it's directed by the producer of the original series Michael Mann.",4,"Not good tv, but great tv!",1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,2304,"['Miami', 'Vice', 'cop', 'shows', 'today', 'look', 'boring', 'are', 'Seeing', 'Law', 'Order', 're-runs', 'advertised', 'time', 'TNT', 'are', 'something', 'exciting', 'wish', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'still', 'was', 'only', 'little', 'when', 'was', 'now', 'dvds', 'got', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'good', 'season', 'not', 'even', 'best', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'TV', 'Land', 'show', 'got', 'even', 'better', 'own', 'season', '2', 'saw', 'recently', 'great', 'season', 'too', ""n't"", 'bad', 'have', 'appearences', 'Ed', ""O'Neal"", 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Jimmy', 'Smitts', 'others', 'music', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'U2.Of', 'couse', 'beginning', 'hit', 'series', ""'Sonny"", 'Crockett', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Tubbs', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'meeting', 'bonding', 'through-out', 'season', 'first', 'Sonny', 'dos', ""n't"", 'want', 'team', 'up', 'eventually', 'first', 'episode', 'Tubbs', 'trying', 'track', 'down', 'man', 'killed', 'brother', 'Crockett', 'mourning', 'dead', 'partner', 'Jimmy', 'Smitts', 'who', 'killed', 'when', 'two', 'are', 'under-cover', 'think', '3', '4', 'episodes', 'series', 'maybe', 'more', 'less', 'Crockett', 'boss', 'killed', 'replaced', 'stone', 'cold', 'Lt.', 'Martin', 'Castillo', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Olmos', 'great', 'Castillo', 'probably', 'most', 'memorable', 'character', ""'m"", 'still', 'having', 'nightmares', 'episode', 'where', 'wearing', 'tiny', 'bathing', 'suit', 'shivers', 'one', 'can', 'replace', 'Olmos', 'Castillo', 'one', 'could', 'play', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'as', 'well', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'either', 'Oh', 'are', 'replacing', 'new', 'movie', '.lol', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Crockett', 'Predator', 'Tubbs', 'mean', 'Jamie', 'Foxx', 'just', 'Predator', 'lol', 'doubt', 'casted', 'looks', 'nothing', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'look', 'wise', 'not', 'like', 'period', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Hustle', 'Flow', 'probbaly', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'would', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'actors', 'grow', '80', 'music', 'style', 'grows', 'too', 'doubt', ""'re"", 'gon', 'be', 'hearing', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'U2', 'new', 'movie', ""'re"", 'most', 'likely', 'just', 'gon', 'get', 'rap', 'sound', 'track', 'only', 'thing', 'wan', 'see', 'directed', 'producer', 'original', 'series', 'Michael', 'Mann']",Miami Vice: Season One

Michal Mann stikes Gold here and if you have never seen this Television trend setter before then you have really missed something. The DVD will make you an addict immediately and you will want to see more. The transfer is very good and the series appears to be timeless despite fashions that are no longer in vogue. The music is of course, the main ingredient in setting atmosphere to party scenes and private thoughts. It is also one of the only series that had criminals who are memorable because they represent the dangerous, hidden, and seemingly untouchable element of society that is always the true source of the supply and demand world of drug culture. Perhaps this fact, along with all of the other things mentioned, make this one of the best cop shows ever to run on television. The series had a pattern. Generally season one had investigative pursuits that had mixed results, criminals were arrested but some got away or got off in light sentencing. Season two had criminals who committed suicide rather than be arrested and later editions featured criminals who went out in a glorious hail of gunfire much to our delight! Get it! Buy it!

599108,A1VUQUJICF9P75,B00005JLEY,J. Young,"[1, 1]","Hard to believe it has been more than 20 years since this show debuted.  And now, 20 years later, it still has much of the same freshness and reality to it, though it is unquestionably sanitized in comparison to the newer police dramas.The wait was worth it, as they've remixed the shows in 5:1 sound.  Hard to beat that!  All the original songs from the original tv show have also been carried over so you get your Phil Collins and your U2 and your Peter Gabriel and your one-hit wonders like Russ Ballard.  The colors are still vibrant and the picture quality is mostly very good, though there are times when the shots are a bit fuzzy.  As for the shows themselves?...The pilot movie is still a good watch.  It's well acted and filmed, and sets the early benchmark for the ""cool factor"" that would dominate the show's 5 year run.  However, the first few shows after that come across more as your standard cop show only with style.  Mostly, you come to realize that this is the result of having a stereotypical lieutenant who is always on Crockett's (Don Johnson) case for not going by the book.  How completely unoriginal.  There is also the overuse of the novelty that is Crockett's ownership of Elvis the Alligator.  Fortunately, once the lieutenant is killed and replaced by the new guy Castillo (Edward James Olmos), the show really starts to find its own place.  Castillo is unlike any police lieutenant or captain in any tv show before Miami Vice.Season One is anything but perfect.  There are no less than 4 episodes that concentrate too much on the love lives of Crockett and/or Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas).  For such a seeming playboy, we learn that Tubbs takes about 5 minutes to fall in love with any girl that speaks to him and looks good, and that gets pretty old pretty fast.  Fortunately, one of these episodes (Calderone's Return Pt. II) relegates the romance to a subplot and results in a thrilling climax.  We also have one episode that focuses on Switek and Zito's personal misadventures.  It has its moments, but is mostly just an episode that blows over.  Yet some stumbles are to be expected in a first season because you have to develop your characters and you have to experiment to find out what works and what doesn't.  In that respect, Season Two should offer more.One of the funny things to watch for throughout Season One are the cameos and guest stars.  Bruce Willis, Ed O'Neill, Pam Grier, Dennis Farina, John Turturro, and a nearly unrecognizeable Ving Rhames are among those who star in these early episodes.  Willis and Farina in particular really sink their teeth well into the roles.  Another thing you're sure to notice is that rarely is there a scene where Crockett is without a cigarette.  He smokes like a chimney, something that is oh so taboo on the TV in this day and age.The acting in general is pretty solid from the top guys.  Don Johnson is just the epitome of cool.  What's amazing is that he pulls off the manliness thing in spite of usually dressing like a ""fashionably conscious"" (i.e. extremely gay) male.  Tubbs' character is a bit too one dimensional, but more than adequate as the supporting guy.  Castillo steals the show with his understated performances.  There are times when episodes are bogged down by the poor acting of bad guys or secondary characters like Crockett's girlfriend, but these can occurances can generally be overlooked.The plots were often redundant, yet I didn't grow tired of them then and don't tire of them now.  The seedy drug smugglers were an element that was truly unique to Miami, particularly in the 80s, and this show capitalizes on that.  It offered TV an entirely new line of possible plots as a result, and more importantly comes across as believable.  You just can't do a good South American smuggling plot if your show is based in Mayberry or Chicago or even NYC or LA.  It fits much better in Miami.And on that note, that's about as much as can be said for Season One.  It is imperfect, it is sometimes hokey, but it is, in the end, Miami Vice.  It is its own show and remains original.  Highlight episodes are the pilot, Calderone's Return Part II, No Exit, Smuggler's Blues, Lombard.  Less than stellar episodes include Cool Runnin', Golden Triangle Parts I and II (Castillo in a speedo!), and Nobody Lives Forever.",4,the beginning of an original,1108684800,"02 18, 2005",2005,4314,"['Hard', 'believe', 'been', 'more', '20', 'years', 'show', 'debuted', 'now', '20', 'years', 'later', 'still', 'much', 'same', 'freshness', 'reality', 'unquestionably', 'sanitized', 'comparison', 'newer', 'police', 'dramas.The', 'wait', 'was', 'worth', ""'ve"", 'remixed', 'shows', '5:1', 'sound', 'Hard', 'beat', 'original', 'songs', 'original', 'tv', 'show', 'have', 'also', 'been', 'carried', 'so', 'get', 'Phil', 'Collins', 'U2', 'Peter', 'Gabriel', 'one-hit', 'wonders', 'Russ', 'Ballard', 'colors', 'are', 'still', 'vibrant', 'picture', 'quality', 'mostly', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'shots', 'are', 'bit', 'fuzzy', 'shows', 'pilot', 'movie', 'still', 'good', 'watch', 'well', 'acted', 'filmed', 'early', 'benchmark', 'cool', 'factor', 'would', 'dominate', 'show', '5', 'year', 'run', 'However', 'first', 'few', 'shows', 'come', 'across', 'more', 'standard', 'cop', 'show', 'only', 'style', 'Mostly', 'come', 'realize', 'result', 'having', 'stereotypical', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'always', 'Crockett', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'case', 'not', 'going', 'book', 'How', 'completely', 'unoriginal', 'also', 'overuse', 'novelty', 'Crockett', 'ownership', 'Elvis', 'Alligator', 'Fortunately', 'once', 'lieutenant', 'killed', 'replaced', 'new', 'guy', 'Castillo', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'show', 'really', 'find', 'own', 'place', 'Castillo', 'police', 'lieutenant', 'captain', 'tv', 'show', 'Miami', 'Vice.Season', 'One', 'anything', 'perfect', 'are', 'less', '4', 'episodes', 'concentrate', 'too', 'much', 'love', 'Crockett', 'and/or', 'Tubbs', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'such', 'seeming', 'playboy', 'learn', 'Tubbs', '5', 'minutes', 'fall', 'love', 'girl', 'good', 'pretty', 'old', 'pretty', 'fast', 'Fortunately', 'one', 'episodes', 'Calderone', 'Return', 'Pt', 'II', 'romance', 'subplot', 'results', 'thrilling', 'climax', 'also', 'have', 'one', 'episode', 'Switek', 'Zito', 'personal', 'misadventures', 'moments', 'mostly', 'just', 'episode', 'over', 'stumbles', 'are', 'be', 'expected', 'first', 'season', 'have', 'develop', 'characters', 'have', 'experiment', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'what', ""n't"", 'respect', 'Season', 'Two', 'should', 'offer', 'more.One', 'funny', 'things', 'watch', 'Season', 'One', 'are', 'cameos', 'guest', 'stars', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'John', 'Turturro', 'nearly', 'unrecognizeable', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'are', 'who', 'star', 'early', 'episodes', 'Willis', 'Farina', 'particular', 'really', 'sink', 'teeth', 'well', 'roles', 'thing', ""'re"", 'sure', 'notice', 'rarely', 'scene', 'where', 'Crockett', 'cigarette', 'chimney', 'something', 'oh', 'so', 'taboo', 'TV', 'day', 'age.The', 'acting', 'general', 'pretty', 'solid', 'top', 'guys', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'just', 'epitome', 'cool', 'What', 'amazing', 'manliness', 'thing', 'spite', 'usually', 'dressing', 'fashionably', 'conscious', 'i.e', 'extremely', 'gay', 'male', 'Tubbs', 'character', 'bit', 'too', 'one', 'dimensional', 'more', 'adequate', 'supporting', 'guy', 'Castillo', 'show', 'understated', 'performances', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'episodes', 'are', 'bogged', 'down', 'poor', 'acting', 'bad', 'guys', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Crockett', 'girlfriend', 'can', 'occurances', 'can', 'generally', 'be', 'overlooked.The', 'plots', 'were', 'often', 'redundant', 'yet', 'did', ""n't"", 'grow', 'tired', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'tire', 'now', 'seedy', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'were', 'element', 'was', 'truly', 'unique', 'Miami', 'particularly', '80s', 'show', 'offered', 'TV', 'entirely', 'new', 'line', 'possible', 'plots', 'result', 'more', 'importantly', 'across', 'believable', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'South', 'American', 'smuggling', 'plot', 'show', 'based', 'Mayberry', 'Chicago', 'even', 'NYC', 'LA', 'much', 'better', 'Miami.And', 'note', 'about', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'Season', 'One', 'imperfect', 'sometimes', 'hokey', 'end', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'own', 'show', 'original', 'Highlight', 'episodes', 'are', 'pilot', 'Calderone', 'Return', 'Part', 'II', 'No', 'Exit', 'Smuggler', 'Blues', 'Lombard', 'Less', 'stellar', 'episodes', 'include', 'Cool', 'Runnin', 'Golden', 'Triangle', 'Parts', 'II', 'Castillo', 'speedo', 'Nobody', 'Forever']",Miami Vice: Season One
599109,A5UGX57EV695M,B00005JLEY,Kenneth M. Pizzi,"[3, 3]","The crime series, ""Miami Vice"" not only spawned a revolutionary change in men's apparel (white linen jackets, t-shirts, no socks) but forever altered the appearance of the typical crime series on television with a gritty and uncomfortable realism that has now become the norm.Someone once said ""Miami Vice was like watching a variation of Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" every week.""  And it is easy to make that comparison with its emphasis on drug runners, drug kingpins and narcotics. ""Miami Vice,"" with its popular theme obviously moves with the fluidity of an MTV video with action sequences orchestrated to popular tunes by Phil Collins, U2, Glenn Frey, and Peter Gabriel to name a few.While ""Miami Vice"" may not have always been the most realistic crime drama on TV (For example, how many cops do you know drive a Ferrari Daytona as their pursuit vehicle?), it was an aborbing, tense, riveting, edge-of-your-seat weekly drama that defined the 80's.  One only needs to look at other lesser-known crime series' like ""Silk Stalkings"" to see the similarities--the good looking, stylized  central characters, the pastel-colored sets, and the fatal attraction to depicting the ugly underbelly of organized crime.This is a terrific set as is Set 2; however, I saved approximately $20.00 purchasing Sets 1 and 2 shrinkwrapped together at Costco for only $39.99 as opposed to the full list price of $43.99 for each set thru Amazon!

I don't have that as the show aired when I was too young to watch.  But given the things I've heard, I gave it a try.  I'm glad I did.  This show stands the test of time better than most shows.  The action is top notch, and I can't help but love the characters.  The soundtrack is pretty awesome too.  Now don't get me wrong, there is some serious 80s cheese on the show.  I don't blame the show, as I'd guess this show defined the stereotypes of the 80s rather than followed them.  But this show has plenty of episodes that transcend time.  For instance, I think Evan is a suprisingly good episode, tackling subjects such as homosexuality as well as redemption.  Lombard is also a great episode, where a symphathetic mobster has to decide whether to testify against his mob friends, or betray his code.  These episodes aren't just good for the 80s, but just good television.  I think their a misconception that Miami Vice is a great 80s show, but their wrong, its just a great show.

Is it the episodes on the DVD having,on top of top-notch suspsense,fitting and entertaining 80's fashion,along with a good laugh every now and then? Is it the episodes being richly executed works of crime drama,that have impeccable character chemistry? Or,is it the DVD having what would be considered a rare gem:the episode ""No Exit"",which feautures Bruce Willis in his pre-""Moonlighting"" years?These are some of the elements. But,nothing tops how ideally and considerately the first season DVD set of ""Miami Vice"" was put together. Let's take a look at the special feautures here,shall we? You have ""The Vibe of Vice"",which shows how ""Miami Vice"" was able to change television,and how Michael Mann and Jan Hammer were able to help. Then,welcome to ""Building the Perfect Vice"". ""Building the Perfect Vice"" not only gives one the detail and insight they want into how ""Miami Vice"" became a show,inside,there is a rare gem. That rare gem? A home made video that Michael Talbott himself made,which shows how ""Miami Vice"" started off unsuccessful!!!! Want to learn more about the costume choices/decisions that were made for ""Miami Vice""? Want to learn how Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas felt about the way they had to dress when it was time for them to film an episode of ""Miami Vice""? If so,you are in luck with ""The Style of Vice""!!!! Let's not forget about the profound insight that ""The Music of Vice"" provides on the music of ""Miami Vice"",and how ""Miami After Vice"" lets one discover Miami and what ""Miami Vice"" simply did for the show,either. Oh,at the same time,this DVD set does list the original air date for an episode,with info on the episode and(for the most part)the guest stars on the episode.Need I say more?",5,It couldn't have been any better.....,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,1805,"['What', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'so', 'good', 'episodes', 'DVD', 'having', 'top', 'top-notch', 'suspsense', 'fitting', 'entertaining', '80', 'fashion', 'good', 'laugh', 'now', 'then', 'episodes', 'being', 'richly', 'executed', 'works', 'crime', 'drama', 'have', 'impeccable', 'character', 'chemistry', 'DVD', 'having', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'considered', 'rare', 'gem', 'episode', 'Exit', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'pre-', 'Moonlighting', 'years', 'are', 'elements', 'nothing', 'how', 'ideally', 'considerately', 'first', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'Let', 'take', 'look', 'special', 'feautures', 'here', 'shall', 'have', 'Vibe', 'Vice', 'how', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'able', 'change', 'television', 'how', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'were', 'able', 'help', 'Then', 'welcome', 'Building', 'Perfect', 'Vice', 'Building', 'Perfect', 'Vice', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'detail', 'insight', 'want', 'how', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'became', 'show', 'inside', 'rare', 'gem', 'rare', 'gem', 'home', 'made', 'video', 'Michael', 'Talbott', 'made', 'how', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'started', 'off', 'unsuccessful', 'Want', 'learn', 'more', 'costume', 'choices/decisions', 'were', 'made', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Want', 'learn', 'how', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'felt', 'way', 'had', 'dress', 'when', 'was', 'time', 'film', 'episode', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'so', 'are', 'luck', 'Style', 'Vice', 'Let', 'not', 'forget', 'profound', 'insight', 'Music', 'Vice', 'music', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'how', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'one', 'discover', 'Miami', 'what', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'simply', 'did', 'show', 'either', 'Oh', 'same', 'time', 'DVD', 'set', 'list', 'original', 'air', 'date', 'episode', 'info', 'episode', 'most', 'part', 'guest', 'stars', 'episode.Need', 'say', 'more']",Miami Vice: Season One

seems to have a problem with freezing up and skipping which is perhaps what has prompted Universal to make and release the MIAMI VICE-The Complete Series DVD box set recently in order to make up or

599135,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00005JLEY,Tim Janson,"[7, 7]","Like it or hate it, Miami Vice was a show, perhaps THE show that best defined the excesses of the 1980's.  Produced in the heart of that period from 1984 to 1989, Miami Vice would become an influence in music, film, and fashion...much to the chagrin of those men who will refuse to admit to wearing pastels themselves.  The show ffocused on the Miami Metro-Dade police ""Vice"" department and it`s continued battle against the illicit drug, prostitution, and firearms crime underworld of the city of Miami.Of course it's most well-known for it's two chic stars Don Johnson as Sonny Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Rico Tubbs.  They had the usual, sourfaced boss in Lt. Castillo played by Edward James Olmos.  The first season features 22 episodes beginning with the series premiere ""Brother's Keeper"" in which NY Cop Tubbs comes to Miami to team with a reluctant Crockett to solve a series of murders surrounding a Columbian Drug kingpin.Other first season episodes of note:""One Eyed Jack"" this episode introduced Olmos as Lt. Castillo.""Glades""  Crockett and Tubbs have to journey into Florida's everglades to find a prosecution witness scheduled to testify in 48 hours.""Give a Little , Take a Little""  Crockett is thrown in jail for refusing to identify an informant.""Smuggler's Blues""  Crockett and Tubbs pose as drug smugglers in order to nail the person responsible for killing drug dealers and their families.  Of course features the hit song Smugglers Blues by Glen Frey.""Lombard""  Crockett and Tubbs must protect a crime boss who is scheduled to testify against the mob.Miami Vice is one of those shows that while great in its time, doesn't age well.  It certainly isn't as gritty as some of our more modern day cop dramas like NYPD Blue or Law & Order.  It was perfect for the time however, a big, loud, colorful, over-the-top action drama with two good looking guys and a lot of eye candy.  One disappointment is the minimal special features on the DVD set.

599136,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00005JLEY,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[3, 3]","When this show was on the air, it was one of the prime examples of style-over-substance of an increasingly superficial pop culture void. MTV was new and was actually playing music videos at the time. However, one of the things ignored by the critics is just how little substance went into these cop shows. There was a crime, a lot of glowering, someone getting killed and a shootout in which justice was sort of served. Adding a fashion plate and a music video into the mix could only improve the cop show formula.So one should get the cheesiness out of the way first. Don Johnson actually rocks the pastel t-shirt under a suit coat or button down shirt look that renders other men homeless looking. The music is sometimes playing over a murder scene. Almost every witness gets killed while Sonny and/or Tubbs is having sex (with the music blaring). You could play a drinking game with all the times that Don Johnson is made to yell ""NOOOOoooooooo!"" and lurch into completely useless action. When Bruce Willis gets killed at the end of the episode (he totally had it coming) you don't even have to cut to him getting shot. Don Johnson simply yelling ""NOOOOOOOO!!!"" and running forward tells you that the character is a corpse.Also, there's really no clarity concerning which department these guys are in. Are they undercover? Drugs? I know it's Vice, but man, they are sure doing a lot more than busting porn rings.Finally, no one can get arrested without trying to shoot their way out of it. It's like these people have never heard of lawyers. The one exception is Dennis Farina's mob boss who responds to finding out that the cops are trying to get him with ""What are you going to arrest me for? Conspiracy to eat lunch?"" and in a later episode decides to turn state's evidence and then pleads the Fifth and in response to one of Don Johnson's ""I'm going to take you down!"" says ""Yeah. That's you job. Nothing personal,"" with such nonchalance that you can't help but love him (which is probably why Michael Mann gave the actorCrime Story: The Complete Series)These are all elements that could kill the show if they weren't so enjoyable.However, the show is not just a series of silly cop cliches and music videos. There is some great acting throughout - particularly with Edward James Olmos who rocks every scene he's in (so there's the answer to the ""when did Olmos become famous"" question). The two leads are pretty one-note but that's not such a problem when the note is exactly what's required (and I crack up every time Tubbs is doing a fake Jamaican accent).  Furthermore, it's rather delightful to see really good actors in that ""before they were famous"" way, including Bruce Willis as a gun running wife-beater, Ed O'Neill as an undercover cop who loves being undercover, John Tuturro as a pimp and Dennis Farina as a scene stealing mobster.All in all, this may not be a brilliant show, but it combines its workmanlike cop stories with decent-to-amazing acting and stylish camera work to stupid elements that are rather charming in their stupidity (like bronies or juggalos).",4,Holds up surprisingly well despite/because of the cheesy 80s cop show cliches,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",2012,3085,"['When', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'was', 'one', 'prime', 'examples', 'style-over-substance', 'increasingly', 'superficial', 'pop', 'culture', 'void', 'MTV', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'actually', 'playing', 'music', 'videos', 'time', 'However', 'one', 'things', 'ignored', 'critics', 'just', 'how', 'little', 'substance', 'went', 'cop', 'shows', 'was', 'crime', 'lot', 'glowering', 'someone', 'getting', 'killed', 'shootout', 'justice', 'was', 'sort', 'served', 'Adding', 'fashion', 'plate', 'music', 'video', 'mix', 'could', 'only', 'improve', 'cop', 'show', 'one', 'should', 'get', 'cheesiness', 'way', 'first', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'actually', 'pastel', 't-shirt', 'suit', 'coat', 'button', 'down', 'shirt', 'look', 'other', 'men', 'homeless', 'looking', 'music', 'sometimes', 'playing', 'murder', 'scene', 'witness', 'killed', 'Sonny', 'and/or', 'Tubbs', 'having', 'sex', 'music', 'blaring', 'could', 'play', 'drinking', 'game', 'times', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'made', 'yell', 'NOOOOoooooooo', 'lurch', 'completely', 'useless', 'action', 'When', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'killed', 'end', 'episode', 'totally', 'had', 'coming', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'cut', 'getting', 'shot', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'simply', 'yelling', 'NOOOOOOOO', 'running', 'forward', 'character', 'corpse.Also', 'really', 'clarity', 'concerning', 'department', 'guys', 'are', 'Are', 'undercover', 'Drugs', 'know', 'Vice', 'man', 'are', 'sure', 'doing', 'lot', 'more', 'busting', 'porn', 'rings.Finally', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'arrested', 'trying', 'shoot', 'way', 'people', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'lawyers', 'one', 'exception', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'mob', 'boss', 'who', 'finding', 'out', 'cops', 'are', 'trying', 'get', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'arrest', 'Conspiracy', 'eat', 'lunch', 'later', 'episode', 'decides', 'turn', 'state', 'evidence', 'then', 'Fifth', 'response', 'one', 'Don', 'Johnson', ""'m"", 'going', 'take', 'down', 'Yeah', 'job', 'Nothing', 'personal', 'such', 'nonchalance', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'probably', 'why', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'gave', 'actorCrime', 'Story', 'Complete', 'Series', 'are', 'elements', 'could', 'kill', 'show', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'enjoyable.However', 'show', 'not', 'just', 'series', 'silly', 'cop', 'cliches', 'music', 'videos', 'great', 'acting', 'particularly', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'who', 'scene', 'answer', 'when', 'did', 'Olmos', 'become', 'famous', 'question', 'two', 'leads', 'are', 'pretty', 'one-note', 'not', 'such', 'problem', 'when', 'note', 'exactly', 'what', 'required', 'crack', 'up', 'time', 'Tubbs', 'doing', 'fake', 'Jamaican', 'accent', 'Furthermore', 'rather', 'delightful', 'see', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'were', 'famous', 'way', 'including', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'gun', 'running', 'wife-beater', 'Ed', ""O'Neill"", 'undercover', 'cop', 'who', 'being', 'undercover', 'John', 'Tuturro', 'pimp', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'scene', 'stealing', 'mobster.All', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'brilliant', 'show', 'workmanlike', 'cop', 'stories', 'decent-to-amazing', 'acting', 'stylish', 'camera', 'work', 'stupid', 'elements', 'are', 'rather', 'charming', 'stupidity', 'bronies', 'juggalos']",Miami Vice: Season One
599137,A26LIR24MAM6VQ,B00005JLEY,"todd rich ""scoop 69""","[4, 7]","This dvd edition ,of the first complete season of "" Miami Vice "" is an absolute must have for the tv show fans. In case you're totally in the dark about this show, "" Miami Vice "" was one of the most revered and watched shows in the 1980's. It has absoutely no resemblance to the flagalant 2006 , Michael Mann film. Starring , a young ,  Don Johnson and Phillip Michael Thomas as lead detectives (Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs),this show quickly went from nightime police drama to cultural icon. "" miami Vice "" is based on a fictional police vice squad in Miami, Florida , and showcases their efforts to infiltrate the ""unground"" drug world from Miami to Cuba ( and occasioanlly New York ). To say, that the show was good, is an understatement , since it defined a generation and permenantly re-shaped television shows. The true magic,in this tv series, still resonates through it's music , breathtaking cinematography, and imagery. Compared to today's standards ,it might appear as old school. However , "" Miami Vice "" was the first predocessor and broke the ground , providing new ways for future programs and features , like "" NYPD Blue "" , and ""CSI "". In a small twist of irony , the original pilot was written by a writer who wrote another hit NBC show , entitled "" Hill Street Blues "". Both of these two shows had an incredible character development,realism and gritty integrity, that collectively won a staggering, 120 Emmy Awards. Watching this dvd was like reliving my teenage years again. Honestly, I put it in my dvd player to check out the first episode and ended up watching most of the dvd for an entire day. The first season is uncut and re-mastered and is an excellent choice for your dvd collection. However , the dvd itself doesn't have that much to offer , if you like alot of extra features. Whereas , the dvd does have special features , they're very generic , dated , and extremely short. Aside from that , it was a sheer pleasure to see old episodes and enjoy cameo appearances by some of today's top actor's like Bruce Willis , Jimmy Smits ,Gene Simmons ,Benicio Del Toro ,Viggo Morteson , Phil Collins , Miles Davis , Ed O'Neill , Lou Diamond Phillips , ect..  The episodes are easy to seperate and the sound is very crip and clear. As a whole , this dvd is a very worthwhile purchase. So , cut off your sleeves , take off those socks, slip on some white penny loafers and stop shaving.

No other television program epitomized the flashy, fast, and over the top nature of the ""Decade of Greed"" than this show. Fortunately, we now have the first season captured in a boxed collector's set.Miami Vice: Season One is a must-have for any fan of the series, fan of the 1980s, or for fans of police/action dramas in general. The picture quality remains pretty true to mid-80's form, but the soundtrack has been digitally remastered into 5.1 stereo surround which sounds fabulous when connected to enhanced speakers (the pulsating soundtrack, screeching wheels, and high-powered shoot-outs all come to life).Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas play detectives Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs as part of a southern Florida undercover unit called Miami Vice. Each episode is packed with action, drama, and suspense...and does not disappoint. Special guest actors make frequent appearances, including Jimmy Smits, Ed O'Neil, and Bruce Willis. Altogether there are over 20 episodes from Season 1 (1984-85) contained in this set, including the original 2 hour program pilot that served as the Miami Vice promo that aired during the summer of 1984.Aside from the episodes themselves are five mini-documentaries on the production of the show, it's music, it's cinematography, it's fashion, and the impact that Miami Vice had on American culture at large in the 1980s. Also, this collector's edition set is packaged in a beautiful fold-out case decorated with silhouttes of palm trees along the Miami sunset and profile shots of Johnson and Thomas.I remember watching Vice as a child, and looking back 20 years later, it is remarkable to consider the lasting impact that this show has had on the popular culture. Miami Vice has had a huge influence on video games (a la the Grand Theft Auto and True Crime: Streets series) and helped usher in a new era of prime time police dramas (such as NYPD Blue and New York Undercover).I highly recommend this DVD set to both fans of the show when it aired during the 1980s and also the younger generation who may have never had the chance to see Miami Vice when it aired, but who are fans of the crime drama.",5,All the glitz and glamor from the show that defined a decade,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,2203,"['When', 'think', '1980s', 'think', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'other', 'television', 'program', 'epitomized', 'flashy', 'fast', 'top', 'nature', 'Decade', 'Greed', 'show', 'Fortunately', 'now', 'have', 'first', 'season', 'captured', 'boxed', 'collector', 'set.Miami', 'Vice', 'Season', 'One', 'must-have', 'fan', 'series', 'fan', '1980s', 'fans', 'police/action', 'dramas', 'general', 'picture', 'quality', 'pretty', 'true', 'mid-80', 'form', 'soundtrack', 'been', 'digitally', 'remastered', '5.1', 'stereo', 'surround', 'fabulous', 'when', 'connected', 'enhanced', 'speakers', 'pulsating', 'soundtrack', 'screeching', 'wheels', 'high-powered', 'shoot-outs', 'come', 'life', '.Don', 'Johnson', 'Philip', 'Michael', 'Thomas', 'play', 'detectives', 'Sonny', 'Crockett', 'Ricardo', 'Tubbs', 'part', 'southern', 'Florida', 'undercover', 'unit', 'called', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'episode', 'packed', 'action', 'drama', 'suspense', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Special', 'guest', 'actors', 'make', 'frequent', 'appearances', 'including', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Ed', ""O'Neil"", 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'are', '20', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', '1984-85', 'contained', 'set', 'including', 'original', '2', 'hour', 'program', 'pilot', 'served', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'promo', 'aired', 'summer', '1984.Aside', 'episodes', 'are', 'five', 'mini-documentaries', 'production', 'show', 'music', 'cinematography', 'fashion', 'impact', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'had', 'American', 'culture', 'large', '1980s', 'Also', 'collector', 'edition', 'set', 'packaged', 'beautiful', 'fold-out', 'case', 'decorated', 'silhouttes', 'palm', 'trees', 'Miami', 'sunset', 'profile', 'shots', 'Johnson', 'Thomas.I', 'remember', 'watching', 'Vice', 'child', 'looking', 'back', '20', 'years', 'later', 'remarkable', 'consider', 'lasting', 'impact', 'show', 'had', 'popular', 'culture', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'had', 'huge', 'influence', 'video', 'games', 'la', 'Grand', 'Theft', 'Auto', 'True', 'Crime', 'Streets', 'series', 'helped', 'usher', 'new', 'era', 'prime', 'time', 'police', 'dramas', 'such', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'New', 'York', 'Undercover', '.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'set', 'fans', 'show', 'when', 'aired', '1980s', 'also', 'younger', 'generation', 'who', 'may', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'see', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'when', 'aired', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'crime', 'drama']",Miami Vice: Season One
