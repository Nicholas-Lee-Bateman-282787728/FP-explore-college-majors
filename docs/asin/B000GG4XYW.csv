1003677,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B000GG4XYW,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[3, 3]","This documentary about the drag legend Charles Busch is a very interesting look at the life of this very entertaining performer.  It traces Busch's life from childhood, through his humble beginnings doing raw theater, through the present, in which he has done movies and had more mainstream Broadway ventures.I have adored Charles Busch and his work since I stumbled across his 2000 film Psycho Beach Party.  Since then, I have seen his work on the acclaimed HBO drama Oz as well as his most recent film, Die Mommie Die.  Busch is a fascinating persona, larger than life, yet very real and easily understood.One of the things that surprised me was the fact that this documentary was made at least 2 or 3 years ago, but is just being released now.  Therefore, there is nothing very recent mentioned as far as new projects Busch is working on.  Also, the clips of his early 1980s stage plays were wonderful, but I really wanted to see more of this rare footage.  They do not spend nearly enough time on these aspects of his career.  The 90 minute running time of the documentary seems to skip over things it shouldn't and linger on things that aren't as interesting.  But overall, it's definitely something I'm glad I have added to my Charles Busch collection.The extra features include a short black and white film done specifically for the documentary.  I was very excited to see this listed on the back of the case, but I was disappointed when viewing it as it is a silent film, made is the style of the 1920s and Mr. Busch is not as captivating when you can't hear his performance.  There are also more snippets of his early plays, but not nearly enough of them.Docurama has done a fine job with this DVD presentation, but it is not the outstanding work I was hoping for.",3,"Fascinating, yet left me wanting more",1163030400,"11 9, 2006",2006,1773,"['documentary', 'drag', 'legend', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'very', 'interesting', 'look', 'life', 'very', 'entertaining', 'performer', 'Busch', 'life', 'childhood', 'humble', 'beginnings', 'doing', 'raw', 'theater', 'present', 'done', 'movies', 'had', 'more', 'mainstream', 'Broadway', 'ventures.I', 'have', 'adored', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'work', 'stumbled', '2000', 'film', 'Psycho', 'Beach', 'Party', 'then', 'have', 'seen', 'work', 'acclaimed', 'HBO', 'drama', 'Oz', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'recent', 'film', 'Die', 'Mommie', 'Die', 'Busch', 'fascinating', 'persona', 'larger', 'life', 'yet', 'very', 'real', 'easily', 'understood.One', 'things', 'surprised', 'was', 'fact', 'documentary', 'was', 'made', 'least', '2', '3', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'being', 'released', 'now', 'Therefore', 'nothing', 'very', 'recent', 'mentioned', 'as', 'far', 'new', 'projects', 'Busch', 'working', 'Also', 'clips', 'early', '1980s', 'stage', 'plays', 'were', 'wonderful', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'rare', 'footage', 'do', 'not', 'spend', 'nearly', 'enough', 'time', 'aspects', 'career', '90', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'documentary', 'skip', 'things', 'should', ""n't"", 'linger', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'overall', 'definitely', 'something', ""'m"", 'glad', 'have', 'added', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'collection.The', 'extra', 'features', 'include', 'short', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'done', 'specifically', 'documentary', 'was', 'very', 'excited', 'see', 'listed', 'back', 'case', 'was', 'disappointed', 'when', 'viewing', 'silent', 'film', 'made', 'style', '1920s', 'Mr.', 'Busch', 'not', 'captivating', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'performance', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'snippets', 'early', 'plays', 'not', 'nearly', 'enough', 'them.Docurama', 'done', 'fine', 'job', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'not', 'outstanding', 'work', 'was', 'hoping']",N/A

1003680,A106016KSI0YQ,B000GG4XYW,Jay Dickson,"[2, 2]","For anyone who loves Charles Busch (and I do), this documentary about his life and work is absolutely required viewing, especially since as extras it includes some videotaped excerpts from his plays, including VAMPIRE LESBIANS OF SODOM, PSYCHO BEACH PARTY, THE LADY IN QUESTION and RED SCARE ON SUNSET (from which I draw my title). The documentary might be a bit puzzling to someone who had not seen the films made from Busch's PSYCHO BEACH PARTY or DIE, MOMMIE, DIE!, given that there are perhaps not enough clips of Busch performing; and the documentary makers use an artificial dramatic arc climaxing with the sudden surgery that Busch had to undergo for a ripped aorta that feels a bit heavy-handed as presented here. (Certainly Busch's life was in serious jeopardy at the time, but he did come through it with flying colors.) yet why quibble, given that over an hour spent in the company of the gifted, funny, and always gracious Charles Busch is like an invitation to heaven? And the film also gives terrific background material about his lonely childhood, his wonderful Aunt Lillian who changed his life, and the many close friends and colleagues who worked with him at theatre-in-Limbo (including Kenneth Elliott, Judy Halston and Andy Halliday, all of whom are interviewed for this documentary, and Meghan Robinson and Robert Carey, both of whom sadly died not long after the opening of THE LADY IN QUESTION). There's also a new silent film short starring Busch, HER ROYAL ESCAPE TO LOVE, shot largely at Belvedere Castle in Central Park, that's intercut with the footage here and also stands on its own as an extra. if you're a fan of Busch, you won't be able to resist; if you're not, you need to see PSYCHO BEACH PARTY so you can become one, and THEN see this documentary.",4,"""I've always felt such an affinity for eleventh-century England""",1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,1784,"['anyone', 'who', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'do', 'documentary', 'life', 'work', 'absolutely', 'required', 'viewing', 'especially', 'extras', 'videotaped', 'excerpts', 'plays', 'including', 'VAMPIRE', 'LESBIANS', 'OF', 'SODOM', 'PSYCHO', 'BEACH', 'PARTY', 'THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'QUESTION', 'RED', 'SCARE', 'ON', 'SUNSET', 'draw', 'title', 'documentary', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'puzzling', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'films', 'made', 'Busch', 'PSYCHO', 'BEACH', 'PARTY', 'DIE', 'MOMMIE', 'DIE', 'given', 'are', 'perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'clips', 'Busch', 'performing', 'documentary', 'makers', 'use', 'artificial', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'climaxing', 'sudden', 'surgery', 'Busch', 'had', 'undergo', 'ripped', 'aorta', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'presented', 'here', 'Certainly', 'Busch', 'life', 'was', 'serious', 'jeopardy', 'time', 'did', 'come', 'flying', 'colors', 'yet', 'why', 'quibble', 'given', 'hour', 'spent', 'company', 'gifted', 'funny', 'always', 'gracious', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'invitation', 'heaven', 'film', 'also', 'terrific', 'material', 'lonely', 'childhood', 'wonderful', 'Aunt', 'Lillian', 'who', 'changed', 'life', 'many', 'close', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'who', 'worked', 'theatre-in-Limbo', 'including', 'Kenneth', 'Elliott', 'Judy', 'Halston', 'Andy', 'Halliday', 'whom', 'are', 'interviewed', 'documentary', 'Meghan', 'Robinson', 'Robert', 'Carey', 'whom', 'sadly', 'died', 'not', 'long', 'opening', 'THE', 'LADY', 'IN', 'QUESTION', 'also', 'new', 'silent', 'film', 'short', 'starring', 'Busch', 'HER', 'ROYAL', 'ESCAPE', 'TO', 'LOVE', 'shot', 'largely', 'Belvedere', 'Castle', 'Central', 'Park', 'intercut', 'footage', 'here', 'also', 'own', 'extra', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Busch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'resist', ""'re"", 'not', 'need', 'see', 'PSYCHO', 'BEACH', 'PARTY', 'can', 'become', 'one', 'THEN', 'see', 'documentary']",N/A

Martin,"[0, 0]","A typical online review of this movie says, ""You will laugh and you will cry as you follow Charles Busch's path to the bright lights on Broadway!""Well... no. I did enjoy this movie, though; and I guess it's not surprising that his fans would gush like that about him. It fits.I wasn't a Charles Busch fan before I watched this movie, and I'm still not a fan, but I'm very glad there are people like him in the world. I'm also glad he has found productive venues for his eccentric talents.I greatly admire anybody - and he is a PERFECT example - who fits nowhere in the world and so makes a place just for himself where nobody was before. Good for him. And everybody who knows him evidently truly loves him (even his own family!), which is remarkable for anybody in any field. Although I neither laughed nor cried a single tear, I'm very glad I watched this movie.I actually liked the silent-movie short included on the DVD (Her Royal Escape to Love, filmed in and around Central Park's wonderful Belvedere Castle after a snowstorm) better than any of his speaking performances. His acting style, which is far too hammy for me, is absolutely perfect for silent movies. He is a terrific silent-movie actor, and if he did more such movies I would become a big fan fast.",3,"Interesting for a non-fan, and the silent short is fabulous",1388534400,"01 1, 2014",2014,1266,"['typical', 'online', 'review', 'movie', 'will', 'laugh', 'will', 'cry', 'follow', 'Charles', 'Busch', 'path', 'bright', 'lights', 'Broadway', 'Well', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'guess', 'not', 'surprising', 'fans', 'would', 'gush', 'fits.I', 'was', ""n't"", 'Charles', 'Busch', 'fan', 'watched', 'movie', ""'m"", 'still', 'not', 'fan', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'are', 'people', 'world', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'found', 'productive', 'venues', 'eccentric', 'talents.I', 'greatly', 'anybody', 'PERFECT', 'example', 'who', 'nowhere', 'world', 'so', 'place', 'just', 'where', 'nobody', 'was', 'Good', 'everybody', 'who', 'evidently', 'truly', 'even', 'own', 'family', 'remarkable', 'anybody', 'field', 'laughed', 'cried', 'single', 'tear', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'watched', 'movie.I', 'actually', 'liked', 'silent-movie', 'short', 'included', 'DVD', 'Royal', 'Escape', 'Love', 'filmed', 'Central', 'Park', 'wonderful', 'Belvedere', 'Castle', 'snowstorm', 'better', 'speaking', 'performances', 'acting', 'style', 'far', 'too', 'hammy', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'silent', 'movies', 'terrific', 'silent-movie', 'actor', 'did', 'more', 'such', 'movies', 'would', 'become', 'big', 'fan', 'fast']",N/A
