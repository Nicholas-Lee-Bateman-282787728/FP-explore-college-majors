198006,A30UL0C1VEBI4H,6300175170,"Avesraggiana ""Divine Madness""","[83, 87]","I have watched many live and video performances of this ballet and this is the one version I find myself returning to time and time again.  There is something so dramatically compelling about the way Makarova and Dowell interpret their roles that my attention is held in a way that perhaps more technically proficient renderings of the roles could not.  Makarova and Dowell in the leads are ultimately the most satisfying interpretations I have yet witnessed.Makarova's dancing is a wonder to behold; her magisterial, liquid adagio dancing in the Act II grand pas deux was of course, a given.  Makarova's dancing was possessed of a unique physicality, a way of moving that made it seem as though her arms and legs were radiating a plush and limitless stretch.  One could almost see an energy field originating from the centre of her body and pulsing out through her arms and legs and emanating far beyond her head, hands and feet.  There seemed to be a mysterious and boundless stretch to Makarova.  Baryshnikov too, had this ""mysterious stretch"" in his dancing.  And Makarova's hands,  what magical and bewitching worlds can be conjured  from a pair expressive arms and hands!  Watch, at the coda of Act II when Makarova's Odette runs towards Dowell's Siegfried, and is caught in his arms and lifted high above his head.  With a ripple of her arms, the well-timed arch of her back, neck and head, one could almost believe Odette would take flight right  then.  The moment is breathtaking and for that moment, time might as well have stopped.What has continued to surprise me is Makarova's Odile. In this act Makarova, physically, becomes a whole other creature.  The same lambent grace is still there, the same palpable and mysterious stretch, but now her edges have sharpened and her dancing has taken on a hard, cold, obdurate quality.  I will never forget her baleful expression when she first turns towards Prince Siegfried to present her hand for the very first time.  This moment marks the beginning of the Act III ""Black Swan"" grand pas de deux, and what a spellbinding moment it is.  The whole ballroom now shines with a hectic glitter and now begins the ultimate dance of deception.Unshakable bravura was never a hallmark of Makarova's dancing and I could quibble about her indifferent fouettes.  I prefer instead to revel in the splendour of her dramatic interpretation.  From start to finish, Makarova's Odile is a textbook example of how to enchant a Prince and an audience into believing completely, an evil magician's deception.  Even as Makarova negotiates Odile's treacherous choreography, her conviction and her hold on her dramatic portrayal is so unwavering that by the end, the Prince is utterly destroyed.  Makarova's Odile is so convincing that at the end of the pas de deux, the audience finds itself on its feet applauding not a ballerina, but for the total triumph of von Rothbart's diabolical creation.  As an aside, Makarova's pique/chaine turns at the end of her solo are so fleet and so delicious that I never again want to see another dancer stumping her way through this same variation.I make special mention of Sir Fredrick Ashton's choreography in Act IV.  There's a particularly lovely and effective sequence where in small groups, Odette ushers away her swan sisters and returns to a kneeling Siegfried, bends down slowly and deeply into an arabesque penche and bestows her forgiveness for Siegfried's unwitting betrayal.  Almost no one does this ""forgiveness and reconciliation"" scene anymore.The overall production values of the Royal Ballet's ""Swan Lake"" are somewhat inconsistent, the stage sets and costumes look like they were taken out of cold storage and the dancing of the corps de ballet could benefit from a more pliant use of the back and arms.Natalia Makarova and Anthony Dowell's dancing are of a kind that informs an age.  I search in vain for a young Makarova or a young Baryshnikov that would bring the same magic and transcendent artistry from which their legends were made.",5,"Still the definitive ""Swan Lake"" - on video",1131840000,"11 13, 2005",2005,4028,"['have', 'watched', 'many', 'live', 'video', 'performances', 'ballet', 'one', 'version', 'find', 'returning', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'something', 'so', 'dramatically', 'compelling', 'way', 'Makarova', 'Dowell', 'interpret', 'roles', 'attention', 'held', 'way', 'perhaps', 'more', 'technically', 'proficient', 'renderings', 'roles', 'could', 'not', 'Makarova', 'Dowell', 'leads', 'are', 'ultimately', 'most', 'satisfying', 'interpretations', 'have', 'yet', 'witnessed.Makarova', 'dancing', 'wonder', 'behold', 'magisterial', 'liquid', 'adagio', 'dancing', 'Act', 'II', 'grand', 'pas', 'deux', 'was', 'course', 'given', 'Makarova', 'dancing', 'was', 'possessed', 'unique', 'physicality', 'way', 'moving', 'made', 'seem', 'arms', 'legs', 'were', 'radiating', 'plush', 'limitless', 'stretch', 'One', 'could', 'almost', 'see', 'energy', 'field', 'originating', 'centre', 'body', 'pulsing', 'out', 'arms', 'legs', 'emanating', 'far', 'head', 'hands', 'feet', 'seemed', 'be', 'mysterious', 'boundless', 'stretch', 'Makarova', 'Baryshnikov', 'too', 'had', 'mysterious', 'stretch', 'dancing', 'Makarova', 'hands', 'what', 'magical', 'bewitching', 'worlds', 'can', 'be', 'conjured', 'pair', 'expressive', 'arms', 'hands', 'Watch', 'coda', 'Act', 'II', 'when', 'Makarova', 'Odette', 'towards', 'Dowell', 'Siegfried', 'caught', 'arms', 'lifted', 'high', 'head', 'ripple', 'arms', 'well-timed', 'arch', 'back', 'neck', 'head', 'one', 'could', 'almost', 'believe', 'Odette', 'would', 'take', 'flight', 'right', 'then', 'moment', 'breathtaking', 'moment', 'time', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'stopped.What', 'continued', 'surprise', 'Makarova', 'Odile', 'act', 'Makarova', 'physically', 'whole', 'other', 'creature', 'same', 'lambent', 'grace', 'still', 'there', 'same', 'palpable', 'mysterious', 'stretch', 'now', 'edges', 'have', 'sharpened', 'dancing', 'taken', 'hard', 'cold', 'obdurate', 'quality', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'baleful', 'expression', 'when', 'first', 'towards', 'Prince', 'Siegfried', 'present', 'hand', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'moment', 'beginning', 'Act', 'III', 'Black', 'Swan', 'grand', 'pas', 'deux', 'what', 'spellbinding', 'moment', 'whole', 'ballroom', 'now', 'hectic', 'glitter', 'now', 'ultimate', 'dance', 'deception.Unshakable', 'bravura', 'was', 'never', 'hallmark', 'Makarova', 'dancing', 'could', 'quibble', 'indifferent', 'fouettes', 'prefer', 'instead', 'revel', 'splendour', 'dramatic', 'interpretation', 'start', 'finish', 'Makarova', 'Odile', 'textbook', 'example', 'how', 'enchant', 'Prince', 'audience', 'believing', 'completely', 'evil', 'magician', 'deception', 'Even', 'Makarova', 'Odile', 'treacherous', 'choreography', 'conviction', 'hold', 'dramatic', 'portrayal', 'so', 'unwavering', 'end', 'Prince', 'utterly', 'destroyed', 'Makarova', 'Odile', 'so', 'convincing', 'end', 'pas', 'deux', 'audience', 'feet', 'applauding', 'not', 'ballerina', 'total', 'triumph', 'von', 'Rothbart', 'diabolical', 'creation', 'aside', 'Makarova', 'pique/chaine', 'end', 'solo', 'are', 'so', 'fleet', 'so', 'delicious', 'never', 'again', 'want', 'see', 'dancer', 'stumping', 'way', 'same', 'variation.I', 'make', 'special', 'mention', 'Sir', 'Fredrick', 'Ashton', 'choreography', 'Act', 'IV', 'particularly', 'lovely', 'effective', 'sequence', 'where', 'small', 'groups', 'Odette', 'away', 'swan', 'sisters', 'returns', 'kneeling', 'Siegfried', 'down', 'slowly', 'deeply', 'arabesque', 'penche', 'forgiveness', 'Siegfried', 'unwitting', 'betrayal', 'one', 'forgiveness', 'reconciliation', 'scene', 'anymore.The', 'overall', 'production', 'values', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'are', 'somewhat', 'inconsistent', 'stage', 'sets', 'costumes', 'look', 'were', 'taken', 'cold', 'storage', 'dancing', 'corps', 'ballet', 'could', 'benefit', 'more', 'pliant', 'use', 'back', 'arms.Natalia', 'Makarova', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'dancing', 'are', 'kind', 'age', 'search', 'vain', 'young', 'Makarova', 'young', 'Baryshnikov', 'would', 'bring', 'same', 'magic', 'transcendent', 'artistry', 'legends', 'were', 'made']",The Bolshoi Ballet Company in The Ultimate Swan Lake VHS

Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky were amazing in their precision, energy, grace &c., &c., &c. Yuri Fateyev, however, as the jester was the special ingredient that made this an absolute masterpiece for me, instead of just a glorious success - he makes it worthy of 6 stars instead of 5. Eldar Aliyev as Rothbart was far and away the best I've seen. Most of all though, the Kirov Theatre Orchestra's performance was what won my heart and stirred my blood (7 stars instead of 6!!). Under Victor Fedotov the music had all the pathos the score demands, and more, but it also had extraordinary crispness and punch when the action needed it (tympani and trombones, especially, at their wondrous best in the climax to the second act).

198012,A4SF7Z3L5YJ1Y,6300175170,"I. Martinez-Ybor ""Ignacio Martnez-Ybor""","[63, 69]","Makarova was, obviously arguably.... given some of the reviews below, the Odette/Odile of her generation. I have not seen a &quot;better&quot; one since. Therefore, this DVD is a must: it's the only visual record we have of her performance. And, notwithstanding criticisms by other reviewers below, I think her performance is a pretty eloquent one, in technique and style. I have seen her quite a few times in the role, and though this is a bit short of the magic I know she could generate, it is fairly representative. I consider myself lucky to have it.Now, as to the rest and why I think, in general, this performance is disappointing. Dowell was a very fine dancer: crisp, clean lines, elegant and satisfactory virtuosity, all in evidence here, as is his natural reticence which is out of place in this piece....... There is no chemistry between him and Makarova. He might as well have been reading the phonebook as he danced. In some ways he struck me as the all-purpose, highly skilled partner doing his job for the visiting ballerina of the evening. Makarova had great partners in this role throughout her career, most notably Ivan Nagy. Together they could make the second act pas-de-deux a truly moving experience. It's a pity such wasn't the case here.Another drawback to this performance was the Royal Ballet itself. I think it was in a rather fallow period at the time. The swans sleepwalk through their part and are off-and-on sloppy. The various dances in the third act are a bore, the Spanish Dance is particularly ludicrous. Though Wayne Sleep does a very good job in the Italian number, everybody else in all the other dances reek of mediocrity, particularly the women. There's no virtuosity, no command of line or technique.... Where's the zest? It didn't help that the conducting was somewhat feeble.In short...... if you are interested in having a record of Makarova's Odette/Odile, get it.....It's a pity she wasn't helped by the framework she was given but c'est la vie. With that very restricted goal in mind, you will not be disappointed. If you are interested in Swan Lake proper and plan in having only one version, stick with the Kirov.DVD quality is quite fine .... the sound is ok but not much more than ok.",3,Total is significantly less than the sum of the parts,1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,2236,"['Makarova', 'was', 'obviously', 'arguably', 'given', 'reviews', 'Odette/Odile', 'generation', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'quot', 'better', 'quot', 'one', 'Therefore', 'DVD', 'must', 'only', 'visual', 'record', 'have', 'performance', 'notwithstanding', 'criticisms', 'other', 'reviewers', 'think', 'performance', 'pretty', 'eloquent', 'one', 'technique', 'style', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'few', 'times', 'role', 'bit', 'short', 'magic', 'know', 'could', 'generate', 'fairly', 'representative', 'consider', 'lucky', 'have', 'it.Now', 'rest', 'why', 'think', 'general', 'performance', 'disappointing', 'Dowell', 'was', 'very', 'fine', 'dancer', 'crisp', 'clean', 'lines', 'elegant', 'satisfactory', 'virtuosity', 'evidence', 'here', 'natural', 'reticence', 'place', 'piece', 'chemistry', 'Makarova', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'reading', 'phonebook', 'danced', 'ways', 'struck', 'all-purpose', 'highly', 'skilled', 'partner', 'doing', 'job', 'visiting', 'ballerina', 'evening', 'Makarova', 'had', 'great', 'partners', 'role', 'career', 'most', 'notably', 'Ivan', 'Nagy', 'Together', 'could', 'make', 'second', 'act', 'pas-de-deux', 'truly', 'moving', 'experience', 'pity', 'such', 'was', ""n't"", 'case', 'drawback', 'performance', 'was', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'think', 'was', 'rather', 'fallow', 'period', 'time', 'swans', 'sleepwalk', 'part', 'are', 'off-and-on', 'sloppy', 'various', 'dances', 'third', 'act', 'are', 'bore', 'Spanish', 'Dance', 'particularly', 'ludicrous', 'Wayne', 'Sleep', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'Italian', 'number', 'everybody', 'else', 'other', 'dances', 'reek', 'mediocrity', 'particularly', 'women', 'virtuosity', 'command', 'line', 'technique', 'Where', 'zest', 'did', ""n't"", 'help', 'conducting', 'was', 'somewhat', 'feeble.In', 'short', 'are', 'interested', 'having', 'record', 'Makarova', 'Odette/Odile', 'get', 'pity', 'was', ""n't"", 'helped', 'framework', 'was', 'given', ""c'est"", 'la', 'vie', 'very', 'restricted', 'goal', 'mind', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'are', 'interested', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'proper', 'plan', 'having', 'only', 'one', 'version', 'stick', 'Kirov.DVD', 'quality', 'quite', 'fine', 'sound', 'ok', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'ok']",The Bolshoi Ballet Company in The Ultimate Swan Lake VHS

198015,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6300175170,K. Boullosa,"[3, 4]","I must first acknowledge up front that ""Swan Lake"" (SL) is not my favorite ballet, and of the three most famed full-length ballets set to Tchaikowsky's music, I prefer the other two, not least because the music itself in ""Nutcracker"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" is far superior (in my opinion) to the pedestrian, repetitive score the composer did for SL. Act I is an outright bore - Baryshnikov once said that as a youngster when he was sent off to see productions of SL at the Kirov, he would sit there thinking to himself, ""Isn't it over yet?  Why isn't it over yet?  When is it going to be over?""  Out of four acts, there is really only about 45 minutes of dancing worth watching: the Act II lakeside scene, the famed Black Swan pas de deux in Act III, and a few moments in the rather short final act.  The rest is filler, and to less than inspiring music.All that said, great dancers in the leading roles can make SL worthwhile, especially if you can push a button and skip Act I and everything in Act III until Odile arrives. . .  In this particular version, the Royal Ballet serves up its excellent corps, a mature but still technically sound Natalia Makarova in the title role, and Anthony Dowell as the feckless Prince Siegfried.  Makarova was born to dance Odette - her lyricism, beautifully articulated feet, back, and arms, and Kirov style are in perfect soulful sync with the choreography.  Although close to the end of her career here, she is still just about fully in command of her technique and shows that her fame in the role was justly earned.  I have never found hers a particularly sympathetic persona but in this performance her occasional inability to conceal her awareness of her gifts did not intrude.  She is less successful, but only slightly less so, in Act III as Odile.  Makarova was never a brilliant classicist, and the bravura dancing required of Odile is generally not her strong point.  In this dilemma she is not alone, as few ballerinas combine the extraordinary lyricism required of Odette AND the brilliant, diamond-hard classicism required of Odile.  In fact, originally, the ballet was conceived for two ballerinas, one dancing Odette and another Odile. The same ballerina doing both parts was a later development.  Nevertheless, Makarova does well in Act III, considering its choreography does not play to her strengths.  She travels practically all the way downstage during her 32 fouettes, but she gets them all done completely and, at the age of 41 and in such a taxing role, that is saying something.  Her balances (which were curiously lacking in security when I saw her years earlier in ""Sleeping Beauty"" - Aurora was definitely NOT one of her better roles) are marvelous and this is, ultimately, a very satisfying performance.Dowell, by contrast, seems curiously bland emotionally - perhaps his natural reserve paled even further next to Makarova's Kirov emotionalism - although he executes his few solos beautifully - one forgets what beautiful, elegant, legs he had - with high jumps and clean turns.  His partnering is, as always, faultless, but, like the Prince in ""Sleeping Beauty"", this is mostly a thankless part.The Royal Ballet's corp performs beautifully, the production is completely traditional - and one of my favorite dramatic dancers from the Royal's past, Derek Rencher, is wasted as von Rothbart (who is NOT wasted as von Rothbart?!).  You want to see Derek Rencher as a biting Tybalt in the first of these recorded, live full-length ballets from the Royal, the Czinner production of Macmillan's Romeo & Juliet, filmed in 1966, with a very mature Margot Fonteyn and a young Rudolf Nureyev - but that, as they say, is another story.",3,"Admirable - As ""Swan Lake"" Goes. . .",1198800000,"12 28, 2007",2007,3690,"['must', 'first', 'acknowledge', 'up', 'front', 'Swan', 'Lake', 'SL', 'not', 'favorite', 'ballet', 'three', 'most', 'famed', 'full-length', 'ballets', 'set', 'Tchaikowsky', 'music', 'prefer', 'other', 'two', 'not', 'least', 'music', 'Nutcracker', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'far', 'superior', 'opinion', 'pedestrian', 'repetitive', 'score', 'composer', 'did', 'SL', 'Act', 'outright', 'bore', 'Baryshnikov', 'once', 'said', 'youngster', 'when', 'was', 'sent', 'off', 'see', 'productions', 'SL', 'Kirov', 'would', 'sit', 'there', 'thinking', ""n't"", 'over', 'yet', 'Why', ""n't"", 'over', 'yet', 'When', 'going', 'be', 'over', 'four', 'acts', 'really', 'only', '45', 'minutes', 'dancing', 'worth', 'watching', 'Act', 'II', 'lakeside', 'scene', 'famed', 'Black', 'Swan', 'pas', 'de', 'deux', 'Act', 'III', 'few', 'moments', 'rather', 'short', 'final', 'act', 'rest', 'filler', 'less', 'inspiring', 'music.All', 'said', 'great', 'dancers', 'leading', 'roles', 'can', 'make', 'SL', 'worthwhile', 'especially', 'can', 'push', 'button', 'skip', 'Act', 'everything', 'Act', 'III', 'Odile', 'arrives', 'particular', 'version', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'up', 'excellent', 'corps', 'mature', 'still', 'technically', 'sound', 'Natalia', 'Makarova', 'title', 'role', 'Anthony', 'Dowell', 'feckless', 'Prince', 'Siegfried', 'Makarova', 'was', 'born', 'dance', 'Odette', 'lyricism', 'beautifully', 'articulated', 'feet', 'back', 'arms', 'Kirov', 'style', 'are', 'perfect', 'soulful', 'sync', 'choreography', 'close', 'end', 'career', 'here', 'still', 'just', 'fully', 'command', 'technique', 'fame', 'role', 'was', 'justly', 'earned', 'have', 'never', 'found', 'hers', 'particularly', 'sympathetic', 'persona', 'performance', 'occasional', 'inability', 'conceal', 'awareness', 'gifts', 'did', 'not', 'intrude', 'less', 'successful', 'only', 'slightly', 'less', 'so', 'Act', 'III', 'Odile', 'Makarova', 'was', 'never', 'brilliant', 'classicist', 'bravura', 'dancing', 'required', 'Odile', 'generally', 'not', 'strong', 'point', 'dilemma', 'not', 'alone', 'few', 'ballerinas', 'combine', 'extraordinary', 'lyricism', 'required', 'Odette', 'AND', 'brilliant', 'diamond-hard', 'classicism', 'required', 'Odile', 'fact', 'originally', 'ballet', 'was', 'conceived', 'two', 'ballerinas', 'one', 'dancing', 'Odette', 'Odile', 'same', 'ballerina', 'doing', 'parts', 'was', 'later', 'development', 'Nevertheless', 'Makarova', 'well', 'Act', 'III', 'considering', 'choreography', 'not', 'play', 'strengths', 'practically', 'way', 'downstage', '32', 'fouettes', 'done', 'completely', 'age', '41', 'such', 'taxing', 'role', 'saying', 'something', 'balances', 'were', 'curiously', 'lacking', 'security', 'when', 'saw', 'years', 'earlier', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'Aurora', 'was', 'definitely', 'NOT', 'one', 'better', 'roles', 'are', 'marvelous', 'ultimately', 'very', 'satisfying', 'performance.Dowell', 'contrast', 'curiously', 'bland', 'emotionally', 'perhaps', 'natural', 'reserve', 'paled', 'even', 'further', 'next', 'Makarova', 'Kirov', 'emotionalism', 'few', 'solos', 'beautifully', 'one', 'beautiful', 'elegant', 'had', 'high', 'jumps', 'clean', 'turns', 'partnering', 'always', 'faultless', 'Prince', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'mostly', 'thankless', 'part.The', 'Royal', 'Ballet', 'corp', 'performs', 'beautifully', 'production', 'completely', 'traditional', 'one', 'favorite', 'dramatic', 'dancers', 'Royal', 'past', 'Derek', 'Rencher', 'wasted', 'von', 'Rothbart', 'who', 'NOT', 'wasted', 'von', 'Rothbart', 'want', 'see', 'Derek', 'Rencher', 'biting', 'Tybalt', 'first', 'recorded', 'live', 'full-length', 'ballets', 'Royal', 'Czinner', 'production', 'Macmillan', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'filmed', '1966', 'very', 'mature', 'Margot', 'Fonteyn', 'young', 'Rudolf', 'Nureyev', 'say', 'story']",The Bolshoi Ballet Company in The Ultimate Swan Lake VHS

Makarova is simply enchanting as Odette the Swan Princess. She was in her early 40's when this was filmed in the 80's. Her classical training in the Russian ballet program is very evident here. She's not perfect, but comes pretty close. This is a very demanding role for any ballerina especially one nearing the end of a fabulous career. Her legendary reputation is certainly solidified by this magnificent performance. Her beautiful, fluid arm movements are absolutely mesmerizing. Her facial and physical expressions add to a beautiful, dramatic interpretation. I have yet to see another ballerina emote and bring forth such dramatic intensity as Odette. Dowell is a very talented dancer and quite handsome too. I enjoyed his pirouettes and he has amazing balance. I thought he was quite sensitive as Prince Siegfried. They seemed to have very good chemistry. The Swan maidens were wonderful, but lacking the exact precision of the Paris Ballet or Kirov corps. Film was beautifully shot and has held up well considering the age of the original master tape.

She is also as technically accomplished as any ballerina I've seen. Now, I do not know anything at all about the techniques of ballet, but I do know beauty when I see it. Partnered with Yulia is Igor Zelensky, a very strong and magnetic male dancer. In the first act, one of the female friends dancing with the Prince is Larissa Lezhnina who stars as Aurora in the Kirov version of Sleeping beauty with Yulia Makhalina as The Lilac Fairy.Tchaikovsky - The Sleeping Beauty / Kirov BalletLarissa also stars in a Kirov version of The Nutcracker.Tchaikovsky - The NutcrackerThis ballet is performed from the stage of the Kirov Theater in St. Petersburg, (once Leningrad). The opulence in that building is spectacular, and you can see part of it on the video ""Bringing Balanchine Back"" by the NYCB.......New York City Ballet: Bringing Balanchine Back.......  The theater had no audience and there was no sign of a live orchestra, although it had very good stereo sound. I doubt if it was a live orchestra because there was no sound of ballet shoes on the stage. Costuming and sets were spectacular. As usual for a Russian performance of Swan Lake it has the so called happy ending, but the Russians should wake up to the fact that the sad ending is better, which is how Petipa and Tchaikovsky designed it to end. The emotion is there in the music for the sacrificial ending, and after all that is a happy ending, for how could there be a more romantic ending than a love living forever in paradise?Typical of Russian ballets, there is very little if any mime used in this production. I like to see mime used in ballet. I believe it was the Russians who invented it, yet now they use it the least. It is a beautiful art form in itself. The arm and hand motions go very well with all the movements of dance. See the American Ballet Theatre for excellent examples of mime in Swan Lake.Tchaikovsky - Swan Lake / American Ballet Theatre, Murphy, CorellaIt was the ABT who showed in mime that the lake the swans inhabit was formed by their tears.This ballet has a running time of 115 minutes which is about right for most Swan Lakes.

The performance is done by the Kirov Ballet and stars Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky.There are many positives regarding this DVD and only one minor negative...let me explain.The good:1.)This is one of the most beautiful renditions of this ballet I've ever been privileged to witness. Makhalina is a vision of loveliness and her skills, designating her as a prima ballerina are not hard to spot. Her spins and balance are flawless and her sense of timing with her partners is perfection itself.2.)Prince Siegfried is danced by Igor Zelensky (a dancer unknown to me prior to this performance). I felt his emotional response to his role was a little flat, BUT his spins and leaps (especially in his solo in Act II) were breath taking. The height and hang-time of his leaps were reminiscent of Baryshnikov in his prime; his leaping spins were exquisitely performed and fully completed.3.)The costumes and sets; simply sumptuous...enough said.4.)Camera work and position of shooting angles was, with a couple of exceptions, well done and resulted in visual pleasing presentation on this DVD.The Negative: (singular)Whether you like a recorded performance with or without a live audience is, of course, a personal preference. However, I felt this work sorely missed the spontaneous response that is only obtained with a live audience. Within this DVD you'll be witness to some of the most incredible skills in the form of a pas de deux or solo dance(s); but then, the music would end, the dancer(s) would hold their finishing poses and...nothing...just dead, disquieting silence. The camera then faded to black and the next scene started.It's hard to express in the written word how much the applause and the shouted 'bravos' add to a performance such as this. To me, the lack of audience response slightly diminished the overall effect of this otherwise magnificent ballet; I really felt that the performance was incomplete...something was missing. One can only wonder how it could not have affected the dancers themselves; hard to believe they'd not have 'given' more before a live audience.Conclusion:One of the finest productions of 'Swan Lake' I've seen, featuring two of the world's best dancers in their prime.

I merely want to say why the ABT production also deserves a five-star rating.A few months ago I bought a DVD of Swan Lake by The American Ballet Theatre even if I wasn't so sure whether Angel Corella would fit the role of Prince Siegfried; I was even less sure about Gillian Murphy because I never heard of her.  To my surprise, Angel is terrific.  He moves elegantly and his stage deportment and poses befit a prince despite his rather undersized stature.  And Gillian Murphy, the moment she appears on the scene she is the incarnation of Natalia Makarova I don't mean she is the copy of her I mean they are of the same caliber.  The ABT has excellent dancers; therefore, I need not spent time to elaborate on it.  It is a very beautiful and interesting production.I had been suspecting that the Kirov production is the same one that I bought many years ago on layser disc format and indeed it is when I saw it yesterday afternoon a few hours after I received it from the mail,  It was issued by Sony then.  It is of course a very beautiful production and Yulia Makhalina is superb, Igor Zelensky is too.  But to say that they are better dancers and or better actors than the ABT couple, I disagree.Let's put it this way, They have different style.  They are all very good,they all belong to the best.Somehow, I still wish that Ethan Stiefel was in the lead role instead. I first discovered him in the film 'Center Stage'; besides being a fantastic dancer, he is also a good actor.  I also have the ABT productions of LE CORSAIRE AND VIRTUOSITY=a mixed bill.  From all these DVDs, to me Ethan is from top to bottom a princely image.  The producer who wishes to produce the new ABT Sleeping Beauty should really cast him as the lead role.

Besides these seven I have watched several online. There are things to like and/or dislike in all versions. This ballet is presented in three acts. Act one has two scenes. My preference is a four act version with prologue. Okay. Likes and Dislikes.Dislikes: Camera work was not as good as it could have been. Costumes were mostly in monotone.  Lighting in act two @ Rothbart and Odile's entrance was too dark. Siegfrieds black tights in act two made his leg movements difficult to see, there should have been a lighter background or perhaps the camera angle was at fault. I detest the awkward ugly unlovely stretched out hopping on one foot in scene two. Aren't there other steps that would work better? Lighting in act one scene two and act three was just ""that"" much too dark. The audio was only two channel stereo; in this day of five and seven channel surround! No extras. What's up Kultur?Likes: The large stage allowed the dancers room to maneuver. The costumes were not overdone nor were there any obtrusive stage sets.(Royal's 2009 version comes to mind).  Lighting other than those noted was fairly uniform. Some costumes in act two were colorful. Still, monotone ruled. Rothbart consigned to the edges of the stage and not interfering with Siegfried and Odile allowed Odile much more stage time. During one effort she goes from light hearted to full leaps when the music swells.(excellent). Overall I believe, the dancing was much more graceful than some other versions. Even the hated hopping on one foot.Third act: instead of a simulated battle between Siegfried and Rothbart, all three dance until Rothbart(lit with a red baby spot) concedes and fades off stage. Much more pleasant to watch. One thing missing was the more dramatic pleading of Siegfried and final forgiveness by Odette found in other version. Overall, I liked this better than some other versions due to the more graceful dancing and the third act ending.May 3. Watched again today and while still impressed with the dancing, I was even less impressed by the lighting which is too dark.
