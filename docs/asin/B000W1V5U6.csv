Most of the other concerts on Blu-Ray are a total rip off in price, this was one of the cheaper ones and other reviewers said these guys were entertaining. I actually did think it was pretty entertaining, and it was a cool experience to watch with my girlfriend with surround sound because it's pretty damn close to feeling like your at an actual live show. If you don't want to spend a lot of money and wanted to get a concert experience and be entertained, I think this purchase is worth the ten bucks.",5,"And I didn't even really like this band, but now I do",1348185600,"09 21, 2012",2012,613,"['girlfriend', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'go', 'local', 'concert', 'town', 'was', 'bummed', 'out', 'got', 'cheer', 'up', 'Most', 'other', 'concerts', 'Blu-Ray', 'are', 'total', 'rip', 'price', 'was', 'one', 'cheaper', 'ones', 'other', 'reviewers', 'said', 'guys', 'were', 'entertaining', 'actually', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'was', 'cool', 'experience', 'watch', 'girlfriend', 'surround', 'sound', 'pretty', 'damn', 'close', 'feeling', 'actual', 'live', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spend', 'lot', 'money', 'wanted', 'get', 'concert', 'experience', 'be', 'entertained', 'think', 'purchase', 'ten', 'bucks']",N/A

I have seen dozens of concerts by the Ladies and this was a good one.  The group has many songs from which to choose and my only complaint with this effort was some of my favorites were missing.  I plan on viewing this DVD many times.Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan,4,Fun,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",2007,372,"['had', 'pleasure', 'seeing', 'concert', 'live', 'DVD', 'super', 'job', 'capturing', 'good', 'concert', 'have', 'seen', 'dozens', 'concerts', 'Ladies', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'group', 'many', 'songs', 'choose', 'only', 'complaint', 'effort', 'was', 'favorites', 'were', 'missing', 'plan', 'viewing', 'DVD', 'many', 'times.Talk', 'Hand', 'Live', 'Michigan']",N/A
