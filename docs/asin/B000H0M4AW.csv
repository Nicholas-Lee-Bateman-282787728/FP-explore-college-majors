1008573,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000H0M4AW,A Customer,"[27, 28]","This dark and unsettling allegory, which mixes very bad behavior with Christian evangelism, features two very fine performances from its leads Gael Garc&Iacute;a Bernal and William Hurt, but this tale of the prodigal son returning to his roots never really picks up steam beyond it's initial exposition. Consequently, we have a film that features a potentially great story, but for the most part, is too stultifyingly slow-paced to really make that much of an impact.We first meet Elvis (Bernal), a twenty-something drifter, who has just been released from the navy. He arrives in Corpus Christi, Texas, hopefully seeking to reconnect with his estranged father (Hurt) who unknowingly fathered him. It turns out that his father is now an evangelical pastor with a nice family and predictably, and although he's civil to Elvis, he wants nothing to do with his illegitimate son.Dejected, Elvis stays on in the City, rooming in a run-down, crummy hotel and obtaining employment as a pizza delivery boy. But some unstoppable, Machiavellian force begins to drive the young man and he begins to exact revenge on the pastor, starting by seducing his daughter a beautiful 16-year-old (Pell James) in all her Catholic innocent glory. Keep in mind he is seducing his half-sister.But this seduction is nothing compared to Elvis has in store for the holy man's other geek son Paul (Paul Dano), a gawky teenage Christian rock singer and campaigner for intelligent design. Is Elvis just a mild-mannered, untroubled sociopath who is picking on an innocent family? Or is there perhaps more substance behind his motivations?Director James Marsh has some good ideas here, embedding his main protagonist with a Ripley-like amoral sensibility, yet what he's eventually trying to say is never quite clear. Perhaps he's juxtaposed the fine line existing between redemption and damnation and he certainly throws in some interesting ideas, strong characterizations, and a couple of sensational twists.However, he obscures these aspects with muddled and too slowly paced directing and a surprisingly vapid central character - a bit of a Johnny one note - that even the talented Garc&iacute;a Bernal cannot overcome. The story is indeed rich and troubling - and somewhat provocative - but the director's choices about what scenes to reveal and what to leave ambiguous feel a bit arbitrary to say the least, and the ending especially feels a bit flat and perfunctory and not as profound as it should have been.Still, Hurt and Bernal make this unfocused film watchable. Hurt's faith has a rugged intensity, and it's a good bet he's more arrogant than your own pastor. Yet the actor also stays away from portraying him as the devilish fire-and-brimstone preacher, the stereotype that the character could have so easily fallen into.Bernal in his quiet way is as charming and as sensual as ever - his looks lend themselves well to this kind of role. But the character of Elvis just lacks the emotional gravitas and weight that say the terrific Ed Norton bought to his disconsolate transient cowboy in Down in the Valley, a much better film that The King bears a remarkable similarity to.

In The King he brings to life a recently discharged servicemanr's plight when he tries to connect with what distant roots he has left. He visits the church where his father, who he has never met, preaches. He is looking for the home he feels he has missed. When he confronts his father, William Hurt, he finds no acceptance only a cautious warning. Hurt, who is now a respected member of the community and family man with a teenage son and daughter, has extreme apprehension about this son he admits to but has every intention of casting out.What we soon find out is every action has a catastrophically ironic result. If only we knew what was to come we would have never have made that move but that's hindsight.The King is excellent in every aspect. All principle acting is superb with Bernal and Pell James being standouts. I loved the music which maintained the sober tone that permeated the entire film.

While I love the whole idea of creating a film that makes you think, that makes you second guess yourself and your beliefs and your entire philosophy of life, and while I love endings that leave you with more than a mere ambiguous answer to your many questions I still have trouble enjoying this film for the mere fact that I fail to see a point amidst all it's originality.I kept trying to at least assign a motive to the central character of Elvis (Gael Garcia Bernal) or at least an ounce of humanity but I couldn't and still can't.  His actions, while repulsive, could have been at least slightly justifiable if he had only hinted towards a reason, hinted towards anything really.  I found his character more than just ominous; he was void of everything but animal lust.I guess that's my main problem with this film, for while it presents itself like that small indie with a message it fails to relay that message properly.  Films like this are best a canvas for human relationships and the dark demons in us all but `The King' fails to reveal any layers in its stock of characters.The only person I felt remotely connected with was Twyla (Laura Harring), for she was the only character who showed real emotion.  Even Gael and Hurt failed to capitalize on their acting abilities (as we all know they have them) and instead delivered almost flat performances.  If the movie was just given a pulse, a reason to exist, then I could begin to try and care about it, but it has no pulse, it has no meaning and thus it delivers just that, nothing.",2,If someone could let me know the point that would be appreciated...,1165276800,"12 5, 2006",2006,1576,"['Okay', 'here', 'issue', 'have', 'love', 'whole', 'idea', 'creating', 'film', 'think', 'second', 'guess', 'beliefs', 'entire', 'philosophy', 'life', 'love', 'endings', 'leave', 'more', 'mere', 'ambiguous', 'answer', 'many', 'questions', 'still', 'have', 'trouble', 'enjoying', 'film', 'mere', 'fact', 'fail', 'see', 'point', 'amidst', 'originality.I', 'kept', 'trying', 'least', 'assign', 'motive', 'central', 'character', 'Elvis', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'least', 'ounce', 'humanity', 'could', ""n't"", 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'actions', 'repulsive', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'least', 'slightly', 'justifiable', 'had', 'only', 'hinted', 'reason', 'hinted', 'towards', 'anything', 'really', 'found', 'character', 'more', 'just', 'ominous', 'was', 'void', 'everything', 'animal', 'lust.I', 'guess', 'main', 'problem', 'film', 'small', 'indie', 'message', 'relay', 'message', 'properly', 'Films', 'are', 'best', 'canvas', 'human', 'relationships', 'dark', 'demons', 'King', 'fails', 'reveal', 'layers', 'stock', 'characters.The', 'only', 'person', 'felt', 'remotely', 'connected', 'was', 'Twyla', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'was', 'only', 'character', 'who', 'showed', 'real', 'emotion', 'Even', 'Gael', 'Hurt', 'failed', 'capitalize', 'acting', 'abilities', 'know', 'have', 'instead', 'delivered', 'almost', 'flat', 'performances', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'given', 'pulse', 'reason', 'exist', 'then', 'could', 'begin', 'try', 'care', 'pulse', 'meaning', 'thus', 'just', 'nothing']",The King

When his father (William Hurt), now a preacher, rejects him, Elvis seeks revenge on his father through his father's new family.""The King"" is a ""horror"" movie, but not in the sense that you are probably used to. According to the ""letter from the director"", that is included in the DVD case of this movie, ""The King"" was partially inspired by the horror movies that the director saw in his youth, including ""Brimstone and Treacle"", a film about a strange young man who makes his way into the family of a middle-aged writer. That plot is pretty much the same as that of ""The King"" (except the bit about the writer), but to call this film a ""horror"" film would be misleading. The term ""horror"" usually evokes images of supernatural monsters or knife-wielding maniacs. Elvis is not a maniac and he is very much a human being. What this film deals with is the horrors that human beings are capable of, given the right (or wrong) circumstances.I can imagine that this film might not be to everyone's tastes. It is slow moving to begin with, and the subject matter is often unpleasant (including the incestuous relationship that forms between Elvis and his half-sister). However, if you're not put off by the plot description, it is a well written and well acted movie (Hurt is in his best role in years and Bernal is always excellent) that takes some interested turns along the way.

1008578,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000H0M4AW,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","THE KING is a film that is bound to polarize audiences: it is a disturbing, brilliantly written and executed film that viewers will love or hate.  This viewer found the work mesmerizingly addictive, one of the more exciting works of cinematic art to come out this year.  Writer Milo Addica ('Monster's Ball', 'Birth') and director James Marsh have created an almost impossible story to tell and in selecting a cast of superb actors have managed to make the unthinkable thinkable.Elvis Valderez (the sensitive and amazingly gifted Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal) is being discharged from the Navy  as the story begins. He leaves his ship with his duffle bag and his rifle and begins his life as a citizen.  After an awkward encounter with a prostitute he sets out on a bus to Corpus Christi, Texas to meet the father he never knew (his mother was a prostitute who got pregnant on duty and gave birth to Elvis, living in poverty with her only child and then dying before Elvis entered the Navy).He arrives in Corpus Christi, buys an old car, drives to the church where is father Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt in clearly one of his finest roles) leads his tacky congregation in evangelical tones accompanied by his son Paul (Paul Dano 'Little Miss Sunshine', 'The Ballad of Jack and Rose', 'L.I.E.' etc) playing the rock guitar. The pastor's family includes a wife Twyla (Laura Harring) who seems unhappy yet committed to the life of a pastor's wife, and young daughter Malerie (Pell James), a plain Jane whose flat affect reads as one who desires sense and change from her world as a controlled pastor's daughter.Elvis confronts his father who does not know him and the pastor informs Elvis that his birth came at a time before he found Jesus: he lets Elvis know a bastard son is unwanted.  Elvis meets Malerie, courts her, and despite all consequences Malerie and Elvis couple.  Elvis works as a pizza delivery boy (his boss Bruno is played by writer Milo Addica), rents a tacky motel room, and devotes his attentions to Malerie (despite the fact that pastor David has forbidden his contact with the family).  Malerie becomes pregnant and tells Elvis she loves him - probably the first time anyone has ever confessed love for him.  Paul visits Elvis's motel room advising him to stay away from his family and Elvis pulls a knife on Paul accidentally leading to his death. Elvis covers his tracks, disposing of the body in the river. He only confesses his act to Malerie who prays with Elvis for God's forgiveness and lets it settle. The rest of the Sandow family think Paul has run away (he and his father argued over one of Paul's songs not using the Bible as lyrics to a simple tune meant to convince the school and public of Intelligent Design versus Evolution) and place signs throughout the town to recover him.  Pastor David watches Elvis mop floors in the pizza parlor, tells him he wants to talk and the two take a ride - where the pastor teaches his 'son' how to shoot with bow and arrow and tells him of his miscreant past.  Elvis is invited to dinner at the pastor's home, then to live in Paul's room much against Twyla's feelings, and eventually the pastor introduces Elvis to his congregation as his 'son in sin'.  The family doesn't cope and the ending begins to spin out of control as events quite bizarre and lurid take place, seemingly all to the end of Elvis at last feeling he belongs to the father he never knew. To reveal the ending would greatly diminish the emotional impact of the film.Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal handles this role with such emotional dexterity and finesse that at no time does he lose our compassion despite the horrors that engulf his plight.  He is simply stunning in every way, an actor of tremendous depth and talent and a screen presence that is utterly commanding.  Likewise William Hurt makes this Pastor understandable and despite his exceedingly religious right evangelical manner, he allows us to see motivation for his actions.  Pell James, Paul Dano, and Laura Harring complete the quintet of players with polished skill.  Director James Marsh knows exactly how to make this tough story work and his pacing and camera and music choices are exactly on target.  For this reviewer this film is one that will linger in the mind indelibly.  Such a shame that the subject matter may prevent a large audience from seeing one of the best films of the year.

1008579,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B000H0M4AW,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[5, 7]","I was happy to come across this film due to Bernal and after viewing this it certainly left me unsettled. This story revolves around a very unsavory topic with very unlikable (albeit well played) characters. The director has chosen to deal with the films events in a very blunt manner and it as result does not make it a very enjoyable viewing.  To no surprise, Gael Garcia Bernal, Pell James, Paul Dano and Laura Harring are all convincing in their respective roles, as well. For some reason though, this film reminded me of Gus van Sant's ""Elephant"": the absurdity of Reality (cin&eacute;ma r&eacute;alit&eacute;).In here we found the main character is discharged from the Navy, Elvis (Gael Garcia Bernal) who travels to Corpus Christi, buys a '69 Cougar and visits a church. He flirts with sixteen-year-old Malerie (Pell James), daughter of the minister, David (William Hurt). The minister learns that Elvis is his son, rejects him and Elvis goes on to secretly pursue a heated sexual relationship with the girl who becomes pregnant. After this, the story inexplicably takes a much darker turn. Surprisingly, the treatment of religious fundamentalism is not heavy handed. But once revealed, Bernal's character is confusing, reprehensible and difficult to explain. Elvis takes responsibility for his actions and is clearly a sensitive, caring person, but an understanding of his horrific behavior is never remotely attempted. His schizophrenic turns are as thoughtless and empty as the rest of this valueless and we are never given an ample history about Elvis' background and perhaps the filmmakers wanted us to fear him for that reason.What's also confusing is the musical score, to me it somehow sounds displaced through out the film but perhaps I am wrong or I'm just being a little too picky.

1008580,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B000H0M4AW,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[7, 7]","""The King"" is a haunting film from the studio that brought us ""Down in the Valley"" and features Gael Garcia Bernal ('Dot the I') and Oscar Winner William Hurt ('Kiss of the Spider Woman'). ""The King"" came and went pretty quietly. It got O.K. reviews (although Richard Roeper said that Hurt's performance was one of the best performances you'd see...Odd, since it's far from Hurts best) and slipped quietly onto DVD. It looked promising enough. The cover says ""Disturbing"" and the premice of the film sounded interesting. It's definitely a weird little movie. Bernal plays Elvis, a young man who is discharged from the Navy and heads to Texas to meet his father David (Hurt, covering up his trademark voice with a Texan accent). David is a pastor and is a borderline ""fire & brimstone"" kind of guy. He's married now to a woman named Tyla (Laura Harring) and has two kids Malerie (Pell James) and Paul (Paul Dano, 'Little Miss Sunshine'). David feels that Elvis was the product of past sinning and therefore, wants nothing to do with the boy. Elvis kind of moves on, but finds himself falling in love with Malerie. Even though we know it's, technically, incest. It's never really mentioned in the film. After Paul discovers that Elvis has been hanging around with his sister, he threatens to tell David and Elvis kills him. It's quick, shocking, and unexpected. Elvis quickly does what every movie character does; He ditches the body. As David searches for his ""lost"" son Paul and Malerie finds out that she's pregnant, David finds himself coming to terms with Elvis. The movie eventually throws a curveball and then ends abruptly. I didn't like the ending immediately, thinking ""that was cheap."" The ending works really well, I think the final line of dialogue sums up the movie pretty well. I've only seen Bernal in one other film, but he's very good here. Other actors could've played this role better, he left some gray areas...But other than that, he's really good. As for Hurt, he's fantastic. As I said, it's not his best performance but it's really good. He gives an Oscar worthy performance, but will probably be forgotten come Oscar time because of how low-key this film was. The movie is a little bit haunting (especially the ending), but I didn't find it disturbing. If you found movies like ""Rivers Edge"" or ""American Beauty"" disturbing, you might find this movie disturbing...But, I don't know. I didn't feel disturbed. It's not a masterpiece, but it was worth the watch.GRADE: B",4,"Ambitious, But From From Perfect",1161129600,"10 18, 2006",2006,2491,"['King', 'haunting', 'film', 'studio', 'brought', 'Down', 'Valley', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Oscar', 'Winner', 'William', 'Hurt', ""'Kiss"", 'Spider', 'Woman', 'King', 'came', 'went', 'pretty', 'quietly', 'got', 'O.K', 'reviews', 'Richard', 'Roeper', 'said', 'Hurt', 'performance', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'performances', ""'d"", 'see', 'Odd', 'far', 'Hurts', 'best', 'slipped', 'quietly', 'DVD', 'looked', 'promising', 'enough', 'cover', 'Disturbing', 'premice', 'film', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'definitely', 'weird', 'little', 'movie', 'Bernal', 'Elvis', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'discharged', 'Navy', 'heads', 'Texas', 'meet', 'father', 'David', 'Hurt', 'covering', 'up', 'trademark', 'voice', 'Texan', 'accent', 'David', 'pastor', 'borderline', 'fire', 'brimstone', 'kind', 'guy', 'married', 'now', 'woman', 'named', 'Tyla', 'Laura', 'Harring', 'two', 'kids', 'Malerie', 'Pell', 'James', 'Paul', 'Paul', 'Dano', ""'Little"", 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'David', 'Elvis', 'was', 'product', 'past', 'sinning', 'therefore', 'nothing', 'do', 'boy', 'Elvis', 'kind', 'moves', 'falling', 'love', 'Malerie', 'Even', 'know', 'technically', 'incest', 'never', 'really', 'mentioned', 'film', 'Paul', 'Elvis', 'been', 'hanging', 'sister', 'tell', 'David', 'Elvis', 'quick', 'shocking', 'unexpected', 'Elvis', 'quickly', 'what', 'movie', 'character', 'body', 'David', 'searches', 'lost', 'son', 'Paul', 'Malerie', 'out', 'pregnant', 'David', 'coming', 'terms', 'Elvis', 'movie', 'eventually', 'curveball', 'then', 'abruptly', 'did', ""n't"", 'ending', 'immediately', 'thinking', 'was', 'cheap', 'ending', 'works', 'really', 'well', 'think', 'final', 'line', 'dialogue', 'sums', 'movie', 'pretty', 'well', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'Bernal', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'here', 'Other', 'actors', 'could', ""'ve"", 'played', 'role', 'better', 'left', 'gray', 'areas', 'other', 'really', 'good', 'Hurt', 'fantastic', 'said', 'not', 'best', 'performance', 'really', 'good', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'performance', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'forgotten', 'come', 'Oscar', 'time', 'how', 'low-key', 'film', 'was', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'haunting', 'especially', 'ending', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'disturbing', 'found', 'movies', 'Rivers', 'Edge', 'American', 'Beauty', 'disturbing', 'might', 'find', 'movie', 'disturbing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'disturbed', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'was', 'worth', 'watch.GRADE', 'B']",The King

Rarely are those principles better illustrated to dramatic effect than in The King.William Hurt plays the part of the respectable preacher, and Gael Garcia Bernal, the illegitimate former soldier son, seeking acknowledgment and love.  When the preacher disowns this son by a relationship with a prostitute years before, the son then remorselessly sabotages him leaving a trail of destruction and criminal behavior which goes undetected.The preacher has the preferred legitimate son, echoes of Cain and Abel, the naive beautiful virgin teenage daughter whom he wishes to seduce, and the attractive wife.  All these things come under threat in this relentless pursuit, as this movie unfolds with gripping, surprising and extreme turns. If the legitimate son is out of the picture will the father accept him? Will he be stopped before it's too late, or will he destroy everything that matters to to the preacher?It's also reminiscent of the Frankenstein story, where the doctor refuses to acknowledge  his creation, and the monster destroys all that is light in his life.  Undoubtedly, a powerful movie, some may find it scary, and you may wonder at the end what would have happened if the son had been accepted from the beginning.I liked this movie when I saw it in theatre, and just because it was not a big Hollywood extravaganza does not mean that it's not a very worthwhile movie.I think you will enjoy this gripping movie, which i highly recommend, and I hope you found this review helpful.",5,A cautionary tale,1252108800,"09 5, 2009",2009,1646,"['When', 'life', 'three', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'counted', 'what', 'fear', 'will', 'appear', 'what', 'resist', 'will', 'persist', 'what', 'disown', 'will', 'come', 'home', 'Rarely', 'are', 'principles', 'better', 'illustrated', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'King.William', 'Hurt', 'part', 'respectable', 'preacher', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'illegitimate', 'former', 'soldier', 'son', 'seeking', 'acknowledgment', 'love', 'When', 'preacher', 'son', 'relationship', 'prostitute', 'years', 'son', 'then', 'remorselessly', 'leaving', 'trail', 'destruction', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'undetected.The', 'preacher', 'preferred', 'legitimate', 'son', 'echoes', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'naive', 'beautiful', 'virgin', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'whom', 'seduce', 'attractive', 'wife', 'things', 'come', 'threat', 'relentless', 'pursuit', 'movie', 'gripping', 'surprising', 'extreme', 'turns', 'legitimate', 'son', 'picture', 'will', 'father', 'accept', 'Will', 'be', 'stopped', 'too', 'late', 'will', 'destroy', 'everything', 'preacher', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'Frankenstein', 'story', 'where', 'doctor', 'acknowledge', 'creation', 'monster', 'light', 'life', 'Undoubtedly', 'powerful', 'movie', 'may', 'find', 'scary', 'may', 'wonder', 'end', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'son', 'had', 'been', 'accepted', 'beginning.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'when', 'saw', 'theatre', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'Hollywood', 'extravaganza', 'not', 'mean', 'not', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'movie.I', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy', 'gripping', 'movie', 'i', 'highly', 'recommend', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'helpful']",The King

1008585,AW5LNZBFQAOWM,B000H0M4AW,"Noir Man ""Foggy Dude""","[3, 14]","As a latecomer to this film I just happened upon it in the Used DVD section of a local music store the other day, and I eagerly purchased it while being curious how this Pastor's family tale would unwrap itself, no pun intended.To say that I was and still am disturbed by the story is to write the obvious, not to mention a bit cliche judging by some reviews I've read for this film.  The long lost son is looking for his father who rejects him right off the bat, which makes for some interesting and deeply sad foundation to the story....something which I was very moved by being that I am a product of the Christian Church and even a seminary graduate....how I was trying to rewrite the story on-the-spot that Elvis was hugged and embraced by the pastor and courageously welcomed into the congregation!  ( That is the true love of God, the forgiveness and grace of Christ that I wanted to see shown through this pastor, yet I was also intrigued by the very real possibility and humanity of the pastor being ashamed and protective and hypocritical....so I was not in the least bit turned off by this film portraying that ).  So, even before that meeting between said Elvis and Pastor the former ""son"" had already taken a liking to the pastor's daughter,Mallory...and he moves in for the kill, pun intended, when he later defends his right to be with her (after manipulating her and crossing her boundaries, romantically and sexually) by killing off Mallory's brother who has come to protect her  (protecting her innocence and/or maybe he thinks this Elvis guy is ""shady"" unlike the filmmakers' commentary that the pastor's family just had fear towards the Elvis guy so they wanted to eliminate him----which is an obvious blanket prejudice of the filmmakers which I do not support---if someone were following my car home from church to give my husband/father a ""hug"" and I didn't know who that person was you better believe that I'd wonder if this person was very hurt/needy or perhaps unstable or perhaps even dangerous...that's not a bad thing, but being wise and discerning, aka Street-Smarts!) Anyway, I digress.I don't know what is more disturbing about this film: the fact that the filmmakers stated that some people saw Elvis as ""not bad"" OR the ""fairy tale"" music that permeated some creepy scenes of Elvis fairly graphically ""making love"" to Mallory (he is 21 and she's 16, so it's statutory rape, yes?!) OR that this sweet music (kind of Motherspaugh-esqe a la ""Bottle Rocket"") is continuing through scenes where the pastor is unknowingly taking Elvis under his arm (with the kind of love he SHOULD have shown at the outset) while his missing son, who Elvis has killed, is still manipulated from the pastor's understanding by Elvis' cruel, lying ways OR how he clued Mallory in to how her brother died by lying to her (""he threatened me""...oh, poor baby) OR how Elvis abused Mallory's trust by praying with her for God's forgiveness AND lying to God in his prayer!?  I mean, Elvis was one sick mutha...so was that music chosen as a kind of pseudo-artistic means towards irony....I am wondering if the filmmakers are a little sick in the head...if irony was the slant, then they did a very poor job of showing contrast in that regard...that did NOT work at all.  And in their commentary at the end they stated, in a surprised tone, that people thought Elvis looked mad AS IF he was gonna do something bad to the pastor AFTER he had killed of Mallory and her mother!?  Give me a gigantic break!  Elvis was on his way to becoming a serial killer, wasn't he?  Are we supposed to be so sympathetic towards him AFTER he played God (not really what God would do) by murdering now 3 people and burning down the house then going to the pastor's office to ""get right""?  He ultimately showed his true colors...that he cared more about himself than Mallory or her brother or her mother or his father/pastor or the honor of his mother...he truly disrespected her ( but God the most) in committing these grave acts!Seldom do I not recommend films, but this is one of those times. While I found the acting to be solid, the storyline and disturbing commentary and directing decisions (to show the bare breast of a ""16 year-old"" while Elvis was grinding away) led me towards a rejection of the film.  Believe me, I am no prude, but to passively portray the sick behavior in the film as just a part of ""everyone has something wrong with them"", something to that effect that the filmmakers stated, as if there is a moral/immoral equivalence throughout all the characters, is just plain rubbish and cowardly, in my opinion.Why not have the courage to draw out the drama of Elvis' horrible/terrible acts against more sinister or troubling music?  Why not draw out the contrast of Elvis' criminal behavior against the devastating realization that the pastor was a part of Elvis' deep pain and loss of his father in his life? ( Who wouldn't want to see William Hurt act out the complexity of mourning the loss of his family, feeling the rage towards Elvis, and grieving his previous ""sin"" of seeing a prostitute and having a son he didn't know about for 21 years? ) No, it seems like the filmmakers put the resulting burden subtly back on the pastor, like it's really his fault----as if they were indirectly telling us, ""Well, ya know, he was never there for Elvis, then rejected him, so really what Elvis did was basically, pretty much that Christian pastor's fault.""  Whoops, maybe I just opened a can of worms....was this film in the end a knock against ""religious"" folks and/or Christians?  Maybe.  If so, do the filmmakers have the courage to admit that?  I think not.So, in the spirit of the film, I ""courageously"" recommend this film.....NOT!",1,The King....of Pseudo-Art,1212710400,"06 6, 2008",2008,5736,"['latecomer', 'film', 'just', 'happened',

1008587,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B000H0M4AW,Peter Baklava,"[7, 9]","""The King"" is a movie that unwinds effortlessly before your eyes, gliding like a river through the depths of a Corpus Christi summer.  An entrancing palette of emerald green lawns and cool blue refinery lights combines with a chiming, dulcimer-laden soundtrack to mesmerizing effect.  The film lulls and soothes, until after watching, when you are forced to reflect on the mayhem you have just witnessed.Then, too, there is something very oddly familiar about this tale of woe, which seems to obliquely refer to several Biblical stories.William Hurt would seem to be the titular ""King"".  He plays David Sandow, the authoritarian pastor of a prosperous Evangelical church in Corpus Christi,  the leader of a large ""flock"", and a prideful man.  He lives a very affluent life with a beautiful suburban home, a lovely wife (Laura Haring, who literally disappears into her role),  and two beautiful, obedient teen-age children.  Interestingly enough, he seems more like a Medieval king than a Christian one.  The symbol that reigns in his home isn't a cross, it's a high-powered hunting bow.David Sandow is hiding a secretive past, which comes back to haunt him in the form of ""Elvis"" (Gael Garcia Bernal), a son that was born out of his union ( in the days before he was ""saved"") with a Mexican prostitute.Freshly discharged from the Navy,  Elvis seems to have no other purpose in life than to claim his rightful inheritance as a part of the pastor's family.Biblically, the character of Elvis would seem to refer to the ""Prodigal Son"" as well as to the story of Jacob (""the Supplanter"").  But Elvis is an oddly vacant character, sort of a borderline personality who has no moral center.  He is a drifter possessed of a kind of animalistic grace,  and when David Sandow bars him from his church and his home, retributions occur--again, in sort of a pre-ordained, Biblical fashion.  Elvis lays with Malerie ( Sandow's daughter),  kills Sandow's  son,  and having effectively covered his tracks,  eventually  replaces the ""good son"" in Sandow's home.  But the tragedy continues to play out, and further consequences are in store...There are just a multitude of things to recommend this movie.  The actors are all excellent in their roles--especially Hurt, as Sandow, and Pell James as Sandow's daughter.Bernal, as Elvis,  will definitely remind veteran movie-watchers of young Martin Sheen, in ""Badlands""  (where Sheen played a character based on murderer Charles Starkweather.)Other subtexts in ""The King""  reveal themes that were present in movies like ""Lone Star"", and ""The Border"", two other films that were set in Texas.  ""The King"",  with its pointed references in the musical score to Tex-Mex and Mexican music, like the aforementioned movies seems to be making comments about the relationship of the two cultures ( another way in which Elvis can be seen as a threatening heir.)Five stars for a masterfully woven, sneaky-good movie.",5,Enjoyable on many levels...,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2932,"['King', 'movie', 'effortlessly', 'eyes', 'gliding', 'river', 'depths', 'Corpus', 'Christi', 'summer', 'entrancing', 'palette', 'emerald', 'green', 'lawns', 'cool', 'blue', 'refinery', 'lights', 'combines', 'chiming', 'dulcimer-laden', 'soundtrack', 'mesmerizing', 'effect', 'film', 'lulls', 'soothes', 'watching', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'reflect', 'mayhem', 'have', 'just', 'witnessed.Then', 'too', 'something', 'very', 'oddly', 'familiar', 'tale', 'woe', 'obliquely', 'refer', 'several', 'Biblical', 'stories.William', 'Hurt', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'titular', 'King', 'David', 'Sandow', 'authoritarian', 'pastor', 'prosperous', 'Evangelical', 'church', 'Corpus', 'Christi', 'leader', 'large', 'flock', 'prideful', 'man', 'very', 'affluent', 'life', 'beautiful', 'suburban', 'home', 'lovely', 'wife', 'Laura', 'Haring', 'who', 'literally', 'role', 'two', 'beautiful', 'obedient', 'teen-age', 'children', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'more', 'Medieval', 'king', 'Christian', 'one', 'symbol', 'home', ""n't"", 'cross', 'high-powered', 'hunting', 'bow.David', 'Sandow', 'hiding', 'secretive', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'form', 'Elvis', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'son', 'was', 'born', 'union', 'days', 'was', 'saved', 'Mexican', 'prostitute.Freshly', 'discharged', 'Navy', 'Elvis', 'have', 'other', 'purpose', 'life', 'claim', 'rightful', 'inheritance', 'part', 'pastor', 'family.Biblically', 'character', 'Elvis', 'would', 'seem', 'refer', 'Prodigal', 'Son', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'Jacob', 'Supplanter', 'Elvis', 'oddly', 'vacant', 'character', 'sort', 'borderline', 'personality', 'who', 'moral', 'center', 'drifter', 'possessed', 'kind', 'animalistic', 'grace', 'when', 'David', 'Sandow', 'church', 'home', 'retributions', 'occur', 'again', 'sort', 'pre-ordained', 'Biblical', 'fashion', 'Elvis', 'Malerie', 'Sandow', 'daughter', 'Sandow', 'son', 'having', 'effectively', 'covered', 'tracks', 'eventually', 'good', 'son', 'Sandow', 'home', 'tragedy', 'play', 'out', 'further', 'consequences', 'are', 'store', 'are', 'just', 'multitude', 'things', 'recommend', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent', 'roles', 'especially', 'Hurt', 'Sandow', 'Pell', 'James', 'Sandow', 'daughter.Bernal', 'Elvis', 'will', 'definitely', 'remind', 'veteran', 'movie-watchers', 'young', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'Badlands', 'where', 'Sheen', 'played', 'character', 'based', 'murderer', 'Charles', 'Starkweather', 'Other', 'subtexts', 'King', 'reveal', 'themes', 'were', 'present', 'movies', 'Lone', 'Star', 'Border', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'were', 'set', 'Texas', 'King', 'pointed', 'references', 'musical', 'score', 'Tex-Mex', 'Mexican', 'music', 'aforementioned', 'movies', 'be', 'making', 'comments', 'relationship', 'two', 'cultures', 'way', 'Elvis', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'threatening', 'heir', 'Five', 'stars', 'masterfully', 'woven', 'sneaky-good', 'movie']",The King
1008588,A27JAIYP0U9FGH,B000H0M4AW,PJR,"[0, 0]","Very tough film. Leaves you speculating about how hurt, shame, and anger might lead to horrible tragedy.There was this intense sense of foreboding under a quiet surface and so very  much was left to the empathetic imagination. This was all quite well done as films go and keeps you involved despite very little dialogue or displays of emotion. Of course not everyone likes this sort of film. Almost a certain type of ""European.""You are never quite sure what is going on inside of the people but there is plenty of context and time for some serious thinking.All in all this was pretty terrific film making and some very nice photography.On the other hand what was happening was disgusting and very sad and one wonders if there is very much point in making a film that is virtually over the top in revolting implications about the lengths that someone might go to get get revenge and deal with his pain and hunger for love (without getting dramatic and hysterical on the screen).Did we need the heavy religious context?? I did not see it as being about religious hypocrisy on the part of the pastor. I thought that he came across as a sincere Christian, more sincere than many.PLOT SPOILER:In the end the boy asks the pastor for help getting God's forgiveness. It raises so many questions about the psychology of the people we have just seen. Is the pastor  sincere enough to see the hurt and thirst for love in his son and put aside his own feelings to help him? For that matter is the boy so mistrustful of his father that only his help in forgiveness can prove his love to the kid?  Or is he just tormenting the father and stirring up the deepest emotions and conflicts? I don't think there is any way to know but the ending in any event raises important issues in a religious and psychological context.Presumably Jesus would love and understand the sinner and forgive him as Jesus forgave his persecutors. Was the pastor up to that? Personally I started to get the idea that he might be. In part this is because I was starting to feel that he felt that he needed to redeem himself for bringing a life into the world that he was not prepared to help and care for. Probably not everyone will agree with me.Was the kid sincere in seeking his father's help? I suspect he was because he had hit rock bottom in his depravity. He was not a maniac or sociopath, He just made a series of very, very terrible mistakes because of his pain and youth that brought out the worst in him. Young people actually do sometimes get deeply into trouble because of intense confused feelings. This would be believable.However we are not given clear answers and we can only ponder life. I liked that though this was a tough film to watch and for me personally much of it was disgusting to be thinking about. But then so much of the human condition is disgusting to think about.The extra features were just okay, not terrible, not great.

I can't agree, pacing and believablity in the pathology of the two lead types are only distant relatives.  I  found this a brilliantly disturbing tale...and I hadn't seen trailers or even read the jacket! Without repeating the story, which reviewers seem to feel the need to do, the kernel of the tension resides in the very ambivalence of Bernal's performance. It is never really clear where the depth of his pathology is rooted, and therefore the scope of his ambitions. It's a marvellously nuanced performance. How far will he go towards seducing his dad's daughter by the lake? Will he top the geek Creationist half-brother when confronted in his seedy motel room? And the look of consummate satisfaction as he raids the fridge of his dad's house after a life-time of exclusion! then there's the marvellous moment of the girl's dawning awareness of the implications of her relationship with Elvis, mid-congregation, as the dad spills his heart.James Marsh's direction has graceful timing throughout. The camera work dollying around the garden prior to the bedroom scene of the double murder is a thrilling stroke, and an unexpected tenderness where we presume gratuitous violence will pour forth. I thought the finale down the corridors of Fundamentalist power were right on and the look of bewilderment on Hurt's face, just the moment worth waiting for. I doubt he's be returning to his flock to absolve himself through public confession and accept Elvis for cleaning up.

Now married with teenage children and pastor of a large congregation in Corpus Christi, the man is in no mood to accept a son conceived in sin, and his refusal sets in motion a kind of murderous vendetta that is played out in the rest of the film.Once you accept the premise of the story, the unexpected and sometimes implausible turns of plot take on an unavoidable inevitability, all the way to its abrupt ending. In an age of embarrassing revelations about the personal lives of high-profile church leaders, this film has a currency for viewers both in and out of the Bible Belt. Behind the blissful appearances, this particular preacher's family is unspeakably troubled, so much so that mother and daughter seem submerged in a grim silence, ready to bristle with resistance to the man who rules their lives. Meanwhile, his son, openly admired in public, draws his rebuke by revealing something of the boy's own personal anguish during a Sunday morning service. Barnel's Elvis (the ""King"" of the title) becomes a sweet-faced angel of vengeance, and when he's done there is virtually nothing left undone.

I don't want to give up the story, but safety issues:1) Your daughters should know that it's unsafe to run off alone with (even sometimes when there's two or three friends) with a stranger. No matter how cute & sweet he is...There are girls who have gotten murdered this way, even from a 'friend' of the family.2) Your kids should not go to a stranger's home, even the boys. Never threaten someone because they might be demented enough to murder you.3) Never invite a stranger to live in your home, even if it's a relative. You have to get to know them first or your family could be in grave danger. It sounds harsh, but too many families have been hurt by this...4) If you lie about your past or present life, it will come back to bite you in the behind. I've seen some Christians do this.

1008593,A2GJ98824GGXGP,B000H0M4AW,Timothy Kearney,"[20, 22]","If you read the summary of THE KING I read before viewing it, you probably expected a heartwarming tale. A young man named Elvis finishes his stint in the Navy and decides to look up his father who abandoned him. The father has since changed his life, married, started a family, and is now a minister. Such a summary promises a conflict or two, but also redemption. Well, I don't want to spoil the experience for potential viewers, but let's just say that when it's on television, it won't be shown on the Hallmark Channel or the Family Channel. It's not a uplifting tale of sin and redemption, but it's still interesting to watch.The film has its weaknesses, but it also has strengths that make it a gripping tale. Gael Garcia Bernal plays Elvis, the young man in search of his father. He's almost emotionless in the role, but this is intentional. If he pushed for the sympathy vote as the abandoned child or went the psychopath route, the film would be too unbelievable. Bernal keeps us interested in what Elvis' next move will be, and we wonder what is going on in his head but we're never certain. William Hurt plays David Sandow, the minister and family man who is also Elvis' father. Paul Dano of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE fame is the oldest son Paul, the apple of his father's eye who will soon graduate from high school and head to Bible college. Both Hurt and Dano work with the material, but one fault of the film is that we're introduced to some potentially wonderful conflictual situations between father and son (Paul), first son (Elvis) and beloved son (Paul), and conflict between the three, but they never materialize. The most troubling relationship in the film is that of Elvis and Malerie, the Sandow daughter. Malerie is a main character and some central situations revolve around her, but she's also the most fully developed character of the film. Pell James plays the young woman with sympathy and we believe she is conflicted, a young woman who is beginning to realize she's bigger than the life she's living but isn't ready to abandon it just yet.For me, the best way to describe this film is interesting. It did not have enough conflict to make it engrossing, but it is well acted and the setting make us feel as if we're in the middle of the Bible Belt. I'm not sure if it's a watch again and again type of film, but still it's worthwhile and certainly makes the viewer think.",4,A Different Look At Family Troubles,1163462400,"11 14, 2006",2006,2397,"['read', 'summary', 'THE', 'KING', 'read', 'viewing', 'probably', 'expected', 'heartwarming', 'tale', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Elvis', 'stint', 'Navy', 'look', 'up', 'father', 'who', 'abandoned', 'father', 'changed', 'life', 'married', 'started', 'family', 'now', 'minister', 'summary', 'conflict', 'two', 'also', 'redemption', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'experience', 'potential', 'viewers', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'when', 'television', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'shown', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'Family', 'Channel', 'not', 'uplifting', 'tale', 'sin', 'redemption', 'still', 'interesting', 'watch.The', 'film', 'weaknesses', 'also', 'strengths', 'make', 'gripping', 'tale', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'Elvis', 'young', 'man', 'search', 'father', 'almost', 'emotionless', 'role', 'intentional', 'pushed', 'sympathy', 'vote', 'abandoned', 'child', 'went', 'psychopath', 'route', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'unbelievable', 'Bernal', 'keeps', 'interested', 'what', 'Elvis', 'next', 'move', 'will', 'be', 'wonder', 'what', 'going', 'head', ""'re"", 'never', 'certain', 'William', 'Hurt', 'David', 'Sandow', 'minister', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'also', 'Elvis', 'father', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'LITTLE', 'MISS', 'SUNSHINE', 'fame', 'oldest', 'son', 'Paul', 'apple', 'father', 'eye', 'who', 'will', 'soon', 'graduate', 'high', 'school', 'head', 'Bible', 'college', 'Hurt', 'Dano', 'work', 'material', 'one', 'fault', 'film', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'potentially', 'wonderful', 'conflictual', 'situations', 'father', 'son', 'Paul', 'first', 'son', 'Elvis', 'beloved', 'son', 'Paul', 'conflict', 'three', 'never', 'materialize', 'most', 'troubling', 'relationship', 'film', 'Elvis', 'Malerie', 'Sandow', 'daughter', 'Malerie', 'main', 'character', 'central', 'situations', 'revolve', 'also', 'most', 'fully', 'developed', 'character', 'film', 'Pell', 'James', 'young', 'woman', 'sympathy', 'believe', 'conflicted', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'beginning', 'realize', 'bigger', 'life', 'living', ""n't"", 'ready', 'abandon', 'just', 'yet.For', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'interesting', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'conflict', 'make', 'engrossing', 'well', 'acted', 'setting', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'middle', 'Bible', 'Belt', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'type', 'film', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'certainly', 'viewer', 'think']",The King
1008594,A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B000H0M4AW,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[3, 4]","The King is an intense, often painful film about a young man named Elvis (Gael Garcia Bernal) who gets out of the Navy and comes to Corpus Christi, Texas to find his father, Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt). When Sandow tells Elvis to stay away from his family, he doesn't realize what he's brought upon his family.This film is full of remarkable performances. Paul Dano (Ballad of Jack and Rose, Little Miss Sunshine) is a young Christian fundamentalist pushing to get intelligent design into the school curriculum. Every time this guy appears in a film, his characters are well-developed and totally unique. He's perfect in The King. Pell James, as the object of Elvis's affection is equally awesome. William Hurt's Pastor Sandow is an amazing character creation and worthy of an Oscar-nomination.Like Monster's Ball (one of the writer's of this wrote Monster's Ball), The King is terribly depressing, but worth watching for the moving story and performances. There's a lot of sex and violence interspersed through this dark story. You may not find yourself wanting to watch it again and again, though. The most interesting part of the film is the examination of Pastor Sandow's faith and how he uses it to deal with the events that occur. The phrase ""I need to get right with God."" will never sound the same to you again, after viewing this film.",4,The King of Indy Films,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1351,"['King', 'intense', 'often', 'painful', 'film', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Elvis', 'Gael', 'Garcia', 'Bernal', 'who', 'Navy', 'Corpus', 'Christi', 'Texas', 'find', 'father', 'Pastor', 'David', 'Sandow', 'William', 'Hurt', 'When', 'Sandow', 'Elvis', 'stay', 'away', 'family', ""n't"", 'realize', 'what', 'brought', 'family.This', 'film', 'full', 'remarkable', 'performances', 'Paul', 'Dano', 'Ballad', 'Jack', 'Rose', 'Little', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'young', 'Christian', 'fundamentalist', 'pushing', 'get', 'intelligent', 'design', 'school', 'curriculum', 'time', 'guy', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'well-developed', 'totally', 'unique', 'perfect', 'King', 'Pell', 'James', 'object', 'Elvis', 'affection', 'equally', 'awesome', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Pastor', 'Sandow', 'amazing', 'character', 'creation', 'worthy', 'Oscar-nomination.Like', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'one', 'writer', 'wrote', 'Monster', 'Ball', 'King', 'terribly', 'depressing', 'worth', 'watching', 'moving', 'story', 'performances', 'lot', 'sex', 'violence', 'interspersed', 'dark', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'find', 'wanting', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'though', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'film', 'examination', 'Pastor', 'Sandow', 'faith', 'how', 'deal', 'events', 'occur', 'phrase', 'need', 'get', 'right', 'God', 'will', 'never', 'sound', 'same', 'again', 'viewing', 'film']",The King
