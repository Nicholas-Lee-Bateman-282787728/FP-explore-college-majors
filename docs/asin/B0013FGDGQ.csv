The Docs wife SLAUGHTERS each and every demonstration of the VitaMix.  OMG - GET A professional - Every other month Costco has a team of about ten people who can practically do back flips and cartwheels with a VitaMix - and you use YOUR WIFE?!?  WHO CAN'T EVEN GET THE FRIGGIN TOP OFF THE BLENDER?!?  If I were an executive at VitaMix, I'd sue to shut down this video.Next comment - use a professional CHEF.This video is a real hack job.  I am sure the doctor and his wife are lovely people and his message is of the utmost importance - - - but to charge $25 for a DVD - I want to learn Kitchen BRAIN SURGERY - not experience two hacks.  For $25 I want Jacque Peppin or America's Test Kitchen folks - hell, I'll even embrace a couple of students from the CIA (Culinary Inst.).I want my money back!  lol  This video is PAINFUL to watch.Please don't let this video turn you off to VitaMix - they are SO MUCH BETTTTTER than what is demonstrated here.  Go to Costco and see the demo - you have to see this machine to believe it.There has GOT to be a better hardcore healthy cooking video out there - I will keep searching and let you know when I find it ;-)",2,PAINFUL -,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,1212,"['DVD', 'PAINFUL', 'approach', 'very', 'healthful', 'cooking', 'Docs', 'wife', 'SLAUGHTERS', 'demonstration', 'VitaMix', 'OMG', 'GET', 'professional', 'other', 'month', 'Costco', 'team', 'about', 'ten', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'practically', 'do', 'back', 'flips', 'cartwheels', 'VitaMix', 'use', 'YOUR', 'WIFE', 'WHO', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'EVEN', 'GET', 'THE', 'FRIGGIN', 'TOP', 'OFF', 'THE', 'BLENDER', 'were', 'executive', 'VitaMix', ""'d"", 'sue', 'shut', 'down', 'video.Next', 'comment', 'use', 'professional', 'CHEF.This', 'video', 'real', 'hack', 'job', 'am', 'sure', 'doctor', 'wife', 'are', 'lovely', 'people', 'message', 'utmost', 'importance', 'charge', '25', 'DVD', 'want', 'learn', 'Kitchen', 'BRAIN', 'SURGERY', 'not', 'experience', 'two', 'hacks', '25', 'want', 'Jacque', 'Peppin', 'America', 'Test', 'Kitchen', 'hell', ""'ll"", 'even', 'embrace', 'couple', 'students', 'CIA', 'Culinary', 'Inst', '.I', 'want', 'money', 'back', 'lol', 'video', 'PAINFUL', 'watch.Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'video', 'turn', 'VitaMix', 'are', 'SO', 'MUCH', 'BETTTTTER', 'what', 'demonstrated', 'here', 'Go', 'Costco', 'see', 'demo', 'have', 'see', 'machine', 'believe', 'it.There', 'GOT', 'be', 'better', 'hardcore', 'healthy', 'cooking', 'video', 'there', 'will', 'keep', 'searching', 'let', 'know', 'when', 'find']",Dr. Fuhrman's Secrets to Healthy Cooking
