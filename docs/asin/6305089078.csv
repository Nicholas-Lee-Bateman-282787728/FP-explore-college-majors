448038,A3L31489BCB1D7,6305089078,El Kabong,"[8, 10]","This is hardly an original insight, but anyone who dismisses Bob Hope as the tiresome, unfunny comic from those dreadful 1960s 'comedies' he appeared in is missing out on a real national treasure - his films up to around 1952 are hysterically funny, and his ROAD entries with cohorts Crosby and Lamour are among the best of 'em. Hope, along with the brilliant Preston Sturges, had restored Paramount to the comedy throne they'd occupied in the early 30s; from the lavish budget and attention to period detail throughout UTOPIA, it's obvious that the studio was not ungrateful. For my money, ROAD TO UTOPIA is the funniest film he ever made (though there are half-a-dozen others close on its heels). As in all ROAD movies, the engine powering the vehicle was the lightning-quick banter between the two leads; Crosby smooth as snake-oil, Hope perpetually suspicious and cowardly. And with excellent reason - no straight man ever victimized a foil the way Bing routinely does to Bob. ROAD movies always threaded their satires of B-movie plots (this one spoofing Robert W Service-style frozen-North melodrama) with plenty of topical humor, much of it capitalizing on the fans' awareness of the stars' personal foibles (Crosby's rivalry with Sinatra, his investments in thoroughbreds, Hope's disastrous box-office returns in LET'S FACE IT), and there's a goodly amount of what's now referred to as 'breaking the fourth wall' (they talk directly to the audience at varying points). What elevates UTOPIA just over the others is the sky-high breezy confidence of everyone involved this go-around. The cast and crew, coming off ROAD TO MOROCCO, were on a roll and knew it, and they ride that momentum for all it's worth (Hope's constant kibitzing is particularly hilarious). Der Bingle gets to groan a couple of subpar songs (as opposed to MOROCCO's highlights - 'Ho Hum' and 'Moonlight Becomes You' - this outing's 'It's Anybody's Spring' and 'Welcome To My Dream' are instantly forgettable) but the team's 'Put It There, Pal' is infectious fun and Miss Lamour's 'Personality' is sexy and sprightly. A further note on Lamour - she's luxuriously beautiful here, an ice-cream sundae with curves (why she's never ranked with the decade's top screen sirens is unfathomable: she's every bit the looker that Lake, Grable, Hayworth &amp; Sheridan were, and a better singer besides). My apologies for not quoting any of the zingers from the script, but there are just too many of them to play favorites with. ROAD TO UTOPIA is well worth the effort it'll take you to track down; get cracking.",4,Who'd Be Selling Fish At This Hour?,998697600,"08 25, 2001",2001,2576,"['hardly', 'original', 'insight', 'anyone', 'who', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'tiresome', 'unfunny', 'comic', 'dreadful', '1960s', ""'comedies"", 'appeared', 'missing', 'out', 'real', 'national', 'treasure', 'films', 'up', '1952', 'are', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'ROAD', 'entries', 'cohorts', 'Crosby', 'Lamour', 'are', 'best', ""'em"", 'Hope', 'brilliant', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'had', 'restored', 'Paramount', 'comedy', 'throne', ""'d"", 'occupied', 'early', '30s', 'lavish', 'budget', 'attention', 'period', 'detail', 'UTOPIA', 'obvious', 'studio', 'was', 'not', 'ungrateful', 'money', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'UTOPIA', 'funniest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'are', 'half-a-dozen', 'others', 'close', 'heels', 'ROAD', 'movies', 'engine', 'powering', 'vehicle', 'was', 'lightning-quick', 'banter', 'two', 'leads', 'Crosby', 'snake-oil', 'Hope', 'perpetually', 'suspicious', 'cowardly', 'excellent', 'reason', 'straight', 'man', 'ever', 'victimized', 'foil', 'way', 'Bing', 'routinely', 'Bob', 'ROAD', 'movies', 'always', 'threaded', 'satires', 'B-movie', 'plots', 'one', 'spoofing', 'Robert', 'W', 'Service-style', 'frozen-North', 'melodrama', 'plenty', 'topical', 'humor', 'much', 'capitalizing', 'fans', 'awareness', 'stars', 'personal', 'foibles', 'Crosby', 'rivalry', 'Sinatra', 'investments', 'thoroughbreds', 'Hope', 'disastrous', 'box-office', 'returns', 'LET', 'FACE', 'IT', 'goodly', 'amount', 'what', 'now', 'referred', ""'breaking"", 'fourth', 'wall', 'talk', 'directly', 'audience', 'varying', 'points', 'What', 'UTOPIA', 'just', 'others', 'sky-high', 'breezy', 'confidence', 'everyone', 'involved', 'go-around', 'cast', 'crew', 'coming', 'off', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'MOROCCO', 'were', 'roll', 'knew', 'ride', 'momentum', 'worth', 'Hope', 'constant', 'kibitzing', 'particularly', 'hilarious', 'Der', 'Bingle', 'groan', 'couple', 'subpar', 'songs', 'opposed', 'MOROCCO', 'highlights', ""'Ho"", 'Hum', ""'Moonlight"", 'Becomes', 'outing', 'Anybody', 'Spring', ""'Welcome"", 'My', 'Dream', 'are', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'team', ""'Put"", 'Pal', 'infectious', 'fun', 'Miss', 'Lamour', ""'Personality"", 'sexy', 'sprightly', 'further', 'note', 'Lamour', 'luxuriously', 'beautiful', 'here', 'ice-cream', 'sundae', 'curves', 'why', 'never', 'ranked', 'decade', 'top', 'screen', 'sirens', 'unfathomable', 'bit', 'looker', 'Lake', 'Grable', 'Hayworth', 'amp', 'Sheridan', 'were', 'better', 'singer', 'apologies', 'not', 'quoting', 'zingers', 'script', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'play', 'favorites', 'ROAD', 'TO', 'UTOPIA', 'well', 'effort', ""'ll"", 'take', 'track', 'down', 'get', 'cracking']",N/A

Then a guy pops in and says ""this is a flashback"" and away we go.We start with two bad guys who murder the father of a beautiful girl (Dorothy Lamour, naturally) and run off with a map to a gold mine.The map is the thing everyone in the film goes after (the ""weenie"" in Hollywood talk) but really it's all about Bob and Bing who wisecrack and croon their way through this film.  The constant jokes start to wear a bit thin and the plot line is even thinner!There is the occasional narrator who pops in at the upper left part of the screen to explain a scene or two.  This was explained earlier in the film where this guy would pop in to explain parts of the plot that were not clear to the audience, but was in fact just a gag to keep the film rolling along.Dorothy does not get a lot of speaking parts as she falls for the guys, especially Bob.The jokes are rather lame and Bing's songs are not very memorable.  Road to Morocco was much better with its silly plot and romantic possibilities.  Road to Utopia is fine but not nearly as funny.
