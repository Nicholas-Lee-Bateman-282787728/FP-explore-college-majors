Guild,"[0, 0]","As a fan of Westerns for over 60 years,I never tire of them.As a kid,every Saturday afternoon we watched Westerns in the local Cinema; though we called it the theatre. That was the era of Roy Rogers,Gene Autry and my favorite,The Durango Kid.In those days the local theatre had a different Western every Friday and Saturday.Most of them were in B&W;,but color was just starting.These Westerns were always straight forward,you always knew who the good guys and the bad guys were,and the good guys always won. There were no hidden messages or weirdness to these yarns at all.Lots of man to man fistfights,lots of gunfights,stagecoach and railroad chases and ,crashes and robberies.The Army often arrived in the nick of time to the accompanyment of bugles and the Injuns always got the worst of it. Settlers got hit pretty hard ;but in the end,Good always won out over Bad,and the ending was happy.The hero always lived to fight another day .The soundtracks were excellent.The comparison with this movie,and what we got during the times of ""High Noon"",""Shootout at the OK Corral"",""Big Valley"" John Wayne, an later with the ""Spaghetti Westerns"" couldn't be greater.In this Western you are going to meet actors and characters you've never heard of ;that is except for Willie Nelson and if you blink your eye,you might miss him all together.If you didn't see his name in the credits;you might even say to yourself,""Gee,that old guy looked like Willie""Apparently Willie drove 10 hours to get to the location where the movie was shot.That had to be 9 hours longer than he spent ther during the filming. doubt if he even stayed overnite.IIt would have made no difference to the movie if Willie or anyone else had played the role.He must have owed them a favor to get his name on the credits.To say the movie was low budget ,is an understatement. One could believe that the cost of renting and feeding the horses and travel to the site must have been the major expenses involved.oh yeah,then there was the cost of the film.The storyline is about as simple as one can imagine,the soundtrack is even simpler;,any historical connection is absent,but the scenery and and quality of the color and images is pretty good.When watching the film,the viewer has to pay pretty close attention to what is going on or else he'll lose the train of thought in the story.The movie is a mental exercise as much as anything else and ,though I haven't done it ;one should really watch it a few times to really figure what it is really all about.As for this fan of Westerns,give me the"" old stuff"" like Wyatt Earp and ,Tombstone"" ""Lonesome Dove"","" Pale Rider"",""The Good,the Bad and the Ugly"",and actors like Lee Van Clef,and Eastwood;or eventhe kind of thing we got in the great ""Deadwood"" series.

736352,A1QYHMXSARAHO4,B0000897B3,Plank Spanker,"[0, 0]","This is a little different kind of western.  The bad guy, as it turns out, is not the real bad guy,  He's rather the product of abuse and the era in which he lives.  Played by Brad Hunt, and very well I might add, as the BG called the Morphinist,  a cold blooded and seemingly indescriminate killer, who, as it turns out, is seeking his own form of retribution against those who have wronged him.  Not that he shows any compassion for innocents, but you come to understand why he is what he is.  The character has enough depth to make him believable and even deserving of a form of sympathy.  The abuse and his addiction to morphine, and his deteriorating physical and mental health is shown progressively throughout the movie.  The abuse is just briefly touched on in the form of flashbacks and is implied throughout the film as a sort of binding thread.  This forms the basis of a bad man who, in the same circumstance, could be anyone.The story is simple, yet very effective.  It starts with a scene of  two brothers with a normal everyday childhood indicative of the time having normal sibling squabbles and trying not to show underlying family concern, that surfaces in the next scene.Then, these two young bothers witness the murder of their father (Willie Nelson) from their hiding place by ruthless ranch hands.  The older of the two, in an effort to spare his younger brother, ends up taken captive, where his descent into evil begins, eventually turning him into the morphine addict and murderer he is.  The younger brother, is later found by a priest and the implication is he is raised as such.  13 years later the younger brother played be Daniel Lapaine (aka the Journeyman) has begun a search for his brother in hopes of redeeming his eternal soul, as his belief would be. He is haunted by real or imagined guilt and driven by it,  Along the way some colorful characters (and familiar faces) enter the story line, some with their own demons.  A standout is character, Walter P Higgs III, played by Dash Mihok, adds some needed color driven also by feelings of guilt, revenge and a warped sense of justice.  Their are other familiar faces in characters played by Barry Corbin, John Beasley and a few others.This is one of those movies that the Primary character, the Journeyman, is, at least, equalled if not upstaged by a co-stars character, in the Morphinist.  It may not be a High Budget production, but it does not need to be.  A Good story line, good directing, and some exceptional performances make for a very good, and welcome offering in the western genre.

One of his grandsons is kidnapped and brutalized by his grandfather's murderers, the other hides and is later taken in by a passing priest.  Roll title credits and roll forward ""Thirteen Years Later....""The kidnapped son becomes an outlaw himself, a spaghetti outlaw whose character is known as the Morphinist (Brad Hunt.)  The younger brother, presumably raised by Catholic priests, is listed in the credits as the Journeyman (Daniel Lapaine.)THE JOURNEYMAN is one of those low budget productions that surprises you with its good acting and smart look.  This is to date director's James Crowley's only feature film.  He's a professional ""location manager""- in other words, he scouts out cool looking locations for films.  THE JOURNEYMAN's dry and desolate setting, southern Texas along the Rio Grande River, look just right for this violent movie.Its premise is intriguing, as well.  After his leg is shattered when his horse is shot and falls on it(this is the same incident that causes the outlaw gang to desert him and further reinforces the revenge motive)  the Morphinist's leg is amputated and he's given morphine to quench the pain.  In short order he is an addict and a brutal, remorseless killer.  He becomes especially jittery when too long from the needle.Hunt is good as the wraithlike young killer.  On the commentary track Crowley tells us that he lost fourteen pounds while filming the movie, and indeed by the end of the movie Hunt looks gaunt and played out.  It's interesting to get an extended back-story on the Man With No Name.  The genesis of evil is too often ignored, and although the Morphinist seemingly kills on a whim (""If he bothers you, shoot him"" he tells one of his outlaw partners in an early scene) by the end of the movie he's a sympathetic character.  Unfortunately the Journeyman, the younger brother who grows up in a seminary, isn't studied nearly as closely.  In fact, I had a hard time figuring out who the young man joining Ledbetter's posse was until I watched the commentary track.  There were other scenes that needed to be fleshed out, I believe, to give the audience a better handle on both son's back stories.If you're a fan of westerns don't be put off by the low-budget origins or the relatively unknown cast - THE JOURNEYMAN is a very good western.  My only complaint is in regards to the script, which I believe needed some doctoring, and the commentary track, which is hard to hear because they never lower the volume on the sound track when director and producer are talking.  Sometimes their voices are drowned out by the sound of the movie.",4,People remember evil longer,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",2004,2671,"['old', 'man', 'shot', 'band', 'outlaws', 'middle', 'Nowhere', 'Texas', 'One', 'grandsons', 'kidnapped', 'brutalized', 'grandfather', 'murderers', 'other', 'hides', 'later', 'taken', 'passing', 'priest', 'Roll', 'title', 'credits', 'roll', 'forward', 'Thirteen', 'Years', 'Later', 'kidnapped', 'son', 'outlaw', 'spaghetti', 'outlaw', 'character', 'known', 'Morphinist', 'Brad', 'Hunt', 'younger', 'brother', 'presumably', 'raised', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'listed', 'credits', 'Journeyman', 'Daniel', 'Lapaine', 'JOURNEYMAN', 'one', 'low', 'budget', 'productions', 'good', 'acting', 'smart', 'look', 'date', 'director', 'James', 'Crowley', 'only', 'feature', 'film', 'professional', 'location', 'manager', 'other', 'words', 'out', 'cool', 'looking', 'locations', 'films', 'JOURNEYMAN', 'dry', 'desolate', 'setting', 'southern', 'Texas', 'Rio', 'Grande', 'River', 'look', 'just', 'right', 'violent', 'movie.Its', 'premise', 'intriguing', 'as', 'well', 'leg', 'shattered', 'when', 'horse', 'shot', 'same', 'incident', 'outlaw', 'gang', 'desert', 'further', 'revenge', 'motive', 'Morphinist', 'leg', 'amputated', 'given', 'morphine', 'quench', 'pain', 'short', 'order', 'addict', 'brutal', 'remorseless', 'killer', 'especially', 'jittery', 'when', 'too', 'long', 'needle.Hunt', 'good', 'wraithlike', 'young', 'killer', 'commentary', 'track', 'Crowley', 'lost', 'fourteen', 'pounds', 'filming', 'movie', 'indeed', 'end', 'movie', 'Hunt', 'gaunt', 'played', 'out', 'interesting', 'get', 'extended', 'back-story', 'Man', 'Name', 'genesis', 'evil', 'too', 'often', 'ignored', 'Morphinist', 'seemingly', 'whim', 'shoot', 'one', 'outlaw', 'partners', 'early', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Journeyman', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'up', 'seminary', ""n't"", 'studied', 'nearly', 'as', 'closely', 'fact', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'who', 'young', 'man', 'joining', 'Ledbetter', 'posse', 'was', 'watched', 'commentary', 'track', 'were', 'other', 'scenes', 'needed', 'be', 'fleshed', 'believe', 'give', 'audience', 'better', 'handle', 'son', 'back', 'stories.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'westerns', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'put', 'off', 'low-budget', 'origins', 'relatively', 'unknown', 'cast', 'JOURNEYMAN', 'very', 'good', 'western', 'only', 'complaint', 'regards', 'script', 'believe', 'needed', 'doctoring', 'commentary', 'track', 'hard', 'hear', 'never', 'lower', 'volume', 'sound', 'track', 'when', 'director', 'producer', 'are', 'talking', 'voices', 'are', 'drowned', 'out', 'sound', 'movie']",Journeyman
