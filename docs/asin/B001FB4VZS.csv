We started watching the show from the first air date, and really enjoyed it till about season 4. The story arc at that time made it apparent the then creative minds in control had no interest in taking Clark/Kal-el down the path of superman. Well, when they lost creative control and the new vanguard stepped in with the later part of season 7, we started watching and due to personal schedules missed most of season 8, we missed some great material. Thus, we ordered Season 8 and were blown away with the direction that they went with the stories, the drawn out and tired story arc of farm boy Kent was finally matured ((I mean how long can a mid 20's character still act like a teenager?)) and the road to being 'Clark Kent aka Superman' was taken. Though he is still going by the blur in the end of this season and into season 9, you can so feel now like never before that the 'Man of Steele' is coming to a fruition. This season is the beginning of more entertaining writing and special effects. If you loved the first 3 seasons, you will more than likely love this season and the next one.",5,Smallville season 8 is the beginning of the best story arc ever!!,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,1172,"['wife', 'are', 'big', 'fans', 'Smallville', 'should', 'say', 'were', 'originally', 'started', 'watching', 'show', 'first', 'air', 'date', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'till', 'season', '4', 'story', 'arc', 'time', 'made', 'apparent', 'then', 'creative', 'minds', 'control', 'had', 'interest', 'taking', 'Clark/Kal-el', 'path', 'superman', 'Well', 'when', 'lost', 'creative', 'control', 'new', 'vanguard', 'stepped', 'later', 'part', 'season', '7', 'started', 'watching', 'due', 'personal', 'schedules', 'missed', 'most', 'season', '8', 'missed', 'great', 'material', 'Thus', 'ordered', 'Season', '8', 'were', 'blown', 'away', 'direction', 'went', 'stories', 'drawn', 'tired', 'story', 'arc', 'farm', 'boy', 'Kent', 'was', 'finally', 'matured', 'mean', 'how', 'long', 'can', 'mid', '20', 'character', 'still', 'teenager', 'road', 'being', ""'Clark"", 'Kent', 'aka', 'Superman', 'was', 'taken', 'still', 'going', 'blur', 'end', 'season', 'season', '9', 'can', 'so', 'feel', 'now', 'never', ""'Man"", 'Steele', 'coming', 'fruition', 'season', 'beginning', 'more', 'entertaining', 'writing', 'special', 'effects', 'loved', 'first', '3', 'seasons', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'love', 'season', 'next', 'one']",Smallville: Season 8

1188672,A1A55A4MN0091W,B001FB4VZS,"Allen H. West ""HDTVOCD""","[2, 4]",I must admit that I've never been a big time CW viewer but for three yrs running now I've gradually got hooked on this show.  While it can be downright confusing following the plot and storylines coming late to this series I find it the most enjoyable weekly series viewing.  This show has it all and the HD Quality is fantastic as are the beautiful people cast in the roles we view.  It sort of reminds me when I was younger and lived close to where I worked and I'd go home for lunch and view All My Children and got addicted viewing it.  This thing has many soap opera elements that bait you and may annoy but at the same time baits you to continue watching.I've never viewed a series that from season to season they alter the thing so much but you continue following though your thoughts may be where the hell this person went especially when they do the reruns out of sequence.  This is simply the best looking group of people I've ever seen on TV and damn why isn't Tom Weller doing Superman on the big screen? Makes one wonder what they could do with this with a Big Screen budget and Tom Weller deserves it and while I'm a guy and not gay I must say this guy is one of the best looking men on screen and he plays the role amazingly well - though at times the constrast can be annoying where they make him too vulnerable or to be blunt too much a pussy for someone that's Superman but when needed he grows a pair and prevails.  While it irks me that they don't have him flying I find it now pleasurable to see them having him evolve and grow and perhaps he finds that flying is always faster than running.;)I find most serial programming to be boring and redundant at my mid life age but the quirky changing storyline keeps me hooked and the quality of this show for something on CW is fantastic and how they do it week after week.  Has anyone else wanted Superman to grab Chloe and get it on - she is hot in a sort of girl next door way! Smallville has great genetic code as it's rare you find any cast member that's not beautiful and now we get a Justice League added to the mix!  I do miss Lex Luther though I must admit but they keep him in the mix with no physical presence to bring him back to life if they choose much like a good Soap Opera does.Considering my viewing was pretty much limited to the past 3 years it makes me wonder what I missed from the first five seasons but has this showed matured well despite it making it challenging to follow the constant changing storyline and character rotations - somehow they do it and it works for me.I'll gladly view season 9 on Friday nights and gradually add a Blu-Ray library as I find the rest of Friday Night viewing truly sucks as Ghost Whisperer has gotten a little kooky and redundant SOSO.  The cast on Smallville and the production quality and Soap Opera Sci-fi make it a pleasure to enjoy and nothing else on TV compares outside the Tudors series on Showtime another sort of brutal Superman with a Soap flare.Enjoy!

1188673,AJYX7A3IOAD71,B001FB4VZS,"Amazon Customer ""GeekGirl""","[1, 1]","I am a recent Smallville convert, having watched all of the first 8 seasons over the last couple of months. I love the new darker turn of this season; thank heavens for finally getting rid of Lana (of whom I was previously a fan until her character played itself out and yet the writers kept her in, no matter the ridiculousness of the plot - seriously, marrying Lex? superpowers?). I am missing Lex Luthor (and the fantastic Michael Rosenbaum) however, as we didn't really get to see the final turn in the Superman/Lex story. I only hope that the writers plan to bring Lex back down the road once Clark completes his turn into the superhero. Of course, this wish is pinned on my desperate hopes that they bring Smallville back for a 10th season now that it has finally become less teen-soap-like. I really like the replacement character of Tess though since she can't really be pinned down. I love the relationship between Clark and Lois, especially since we all know how inevitable it is. It felt a little patchy, however, when Clark was supposedly so in love with the returned super-powered Lana, who leaves Clark devastated and in the next episode he is completely over her and back on track with his infatuation with Lois. This can most likely be attributed to the writers realizing that Clark had really long since fallen out of love with Lana and her farewell episode was idiotic and there was no need to dwell on the writers mistake. Love Oliver's character (played by the great Justin Hartley) and the always reliably wonderful Allison Mack as Chloe. It's nice to see them as more than just background characters for Clark to bounce off of. My only complaint is this: let Clark fly already!!",5,Fantastic season!

1188674,AFIX0GHKWKRAJ,B001FB4VZS,Amazon Customer,"[6, 11]","If you are already looking at this page, you have probably made up your mind on whether or not you are going to buy Smallville Season 8. For those who haven't decided let me see if I can help. As an avid Smallville and Superman fan (sidenote: I've got a S Crest Tattoo and superman complex to boot) I love the direction Smallville has taken in recent seasons. They gave us growth in characters and dramatic stories and the always enjoyable easter eggs of DC characters to grace the small screen. The question you should be asking yourself while you decide, is whether or not this season is worth the buy as a BOX SET, as oppose buying singular episodes. Its the same specials as previous sets (few commentaries, deleted scenes), but nothing out of the ordinary.Should this season be among your Smallville collection? Is it worth remembering? In my opinion yes! The exploration of Jimmy Olsen's character was wonderful and dark and his turbulant relationship with Chloe was good departure from Lana/Clark on/off dibacle. Lois was actually utilized effectively to amazing results. Tess Mercer was an interesting villianess to say the least, and Doomsday was pulled off well in live action. Supergirl returned and left gracefully (however, I will miss this Girl of Steel). And the ""Legionaries"" and ""Injustice League"" episodes and Zatanna apperance were fun, campy, and further developed Clark as a character and Hero. There are many things that should drive you to get the Season as a whole. However, drawbacks include the lackluster Lana and Clark drama/arc...again and the sort of anticlimactic season finale (for me at least). All that we saw this season and we get a weak Justice League appearance/cameo, the endless reference to the red/blue blur, and the disappearance and death of staple Smallville characters. To die hard fans, Clark/Superman was supposed to die at the hands of Doomsday. Way to mess with comicbook lore, writers.These flaws however will not deter me from getting Season 8 and it shouldn't deter you. Hopefully as season 9 draws near, these flaws will be addressed and Superman will be unleashed.

The development of the many characters and the chemistry of the actors is really what makes this show worth watching.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 1]","If any one season of Smallville made me feel like I was deeply immersed in Superman mythology and was watching a true, live-action version of a DC comic book, Season Eight was it.Not only is Clark Kent and Lois Lane working at the Daily Planet, but Doomsday, the monster that killed Superman in the comics, is the over-arcing plot this season. He comes in the form of Davis Bloom whom, we learn, experiences these mysterious blackouts as he transforms into the Kryptonian beast and murders anyone that crosses his path.To make matters worse, Davis has a soft spot for Chloe and despite her best intentions, giving in only sets off a chain of events that screws up her relationship with both him and Clark.Also introduced this season--and taking the place of Lex Luthor--is Tess Mercer. At first she's as loyal to the Luthor name as anyone, but when she learns what kind of a man Lex Luthor truly was, everything changes and we encounter a woman who is just as evil as her predecessor.I have to admit I was unsure how Smallville was going to work without Lana Lang and Lex Luthor as key characters, and for the first few episodes, the show did feel a little empty, but that was more than made up for with the breakneck pace the show took and the dark path it led its viewers down while creating the Doomsday saga. With Tess Mercer and Doomsday as the central villains, you forget all about Lex Luthor and instead try to read between the lines to see how he'll one day return as Clark's rightful foe, while watching Tess and Doomsday lead the world into destruction.I was really happy with how this season turned out after my initial skepticism. The episodes were great, the appearances of other DC alumni like Zatanna, Mazima, Jimmy Olsen, the Legion of Superheroes and more just made Season Eight fantastic.Like I always say, this show just keeps getting better and better and I cannot wait to see how everything pans out from here on in.

1188681,AI46E73DWKD2B,B001FB4VZS,BackToGood,"[3, 4]","I started watching SMALLVILLE (which premiered in 2001) on a first run basis with this SEASON 8 (that I'm reviewing). I'd heard about the show back during it's pre-series premiere period and had obviously seen Tom Welling and immediately saw why (from a physical standpoint) was a good choice for the role. But, as the old saying goes, ""The proof is in the pudding"", so I had to actually see for myself. I knew that the show really was supposed to be about Clark Kent before he became Superman, but obviously since the show kept going for so long, they couldn't avoid him growing up and having to start working at the Daily Planet in Metropolis. Having bought the dvds of all previous seasons (1 to 7), the show presents it's own unique twist on the Superman legend. So for those 7 seasons, the show was pretty much set strictly in Smallville, Kansas with a ""teen-aged"" Clark Kent, starting out as a kind of teen detective investigating mysterious goings-on in Smallville (Seasons 1-3), then shifting more towards learning about his true identity and destiny (Seasons 4-7). Then in comes SEASON 8 and now he's FINALLY working at the DP in Metropolis (which happens to be nearby his hometown!) and morphing into a real superhero!Before I get into the meat of my review, I've got to say that I think Tom Welling was a great choice for the role. He perfectly plays Clark as a sweet, slightly awkward and guarded innocent youth, not the faux geeky, clumsy Clark putting on a ruse for the rest of the world. That is, he is just being himself! It's kind of like watching Superman if he were walking around as he is one of us...which he actually is on this show! And Welling is still convincing looking like a hero-in-the-making and pulling off saves from week-toweek. He's done a very commendable job of carrying the series for it's run. SEASON 8 is the start of Welling being allowed to give Clark more depth, complexity, and maturity, but still embodying the boyish charm that he had in previous seasons, with still lingering desires and ties to his former small town life.SEASON 8 is interesting b/c I didn't realize how long the character Lois Lane (played wonderfully by Erica Durance) had been on the show. I think I saw a glimpse of an episode from an earlier season by accident (when I was channel-flipping!) with her in it and at the time thought, ""Oh, so they decided to bring Lois Lane into Smallville!"". I actually remember it was a scene with Clark where they didn't seem to get along at all! Lois was actually introduced in the Season 4 premiere episode CRUSADE as the cousin of Chloe Sullivan (played by the refreshing Allison Mack, who's been part of the main cast since the show's inception in 2001). I needed to see the earlier episodes to gain some perspective on the current ones and see that Clark and Lois have always had this witty, snappy banter from their first meeting (there were actually times when you could have confused them for feuding siblings!). A kind of pre-cursor to their future, iconic sympatico once the Superman story kicks off. The weird thing is that bringing Lois onto the show would seem like a bad idea, but it is the total opposite! Lois and her interactions with Clark made Season 4 for me, and is really a large part of the progression and maturity of Clark Kent, whereas other characters in one way or another seemed to keep him tied down.Early SEASON 8 was kind of a transition period trying to make Metropolis the main backdrop of storylines and the start was a tad shaky, as the show was undergoing a major overhaul with half of the cast being newcomers, so the viewer had to all of a sudden get used to fresh new faces. The season premiere Episode 1-ODYSSEY was a mixed big, starting with great action sequence in the Arctic at the remains of the Fortress of Solitude (destroyed by Lex Luthor at the end of Season 7, with he and Clark being caught in the explosion), then dual rescue attempts of Clark (in Russia) and Chloe (in a Luthorcorp Nevada facility) by Oliver Queen aka The Green Arrow (new series regular Justin Hartley, who was only a recurring character in Season 6 and appeared in only one episode in Season 7) and Lois, respectively, then some ethereal nonsense with the Martian Manhunter character aka John Jones, culminating in Clark and Lois becoming partner reporters at the DP; also a new character Tess Mercer (played with delicious complexity by fiery redhead Cassidy Freeman) is introduced as Lex Luthor's top assistant that he put in charge of his corporation Luthorcorp in case he became incapacitated (as he did in Season 7 finale ARCTIC). Standout eps of early SEASON 8 include Ep 5-COMMITTED (an iconic Lois and Clark episode!) and Ep 6-PREY (the beginnings of the Doomsday storyline, with new regular Sam Witwer playing paramedic Davis Bloome, who alter ego is Doomsday). Also, the impending marriage of Chloe and Jimmy Olsen (played hilariously by regular Aaron Ashmore since Season 6) plays a big part in early SEASON 8. Generally, early SEASON 8 has an iconic Superman feel, but Clark hasn't fully assumed that identity yet and instead saves people under the moniker ""The Red-Blue Blur"", or RBB for short. Another big part of early SEASON 8 is Lois surprisingly having strong feelings towards Clark that she didn't expect to have, but Clark being totally oblivious to them! An ironic twist of the legend where usually Clark falls for Lois first, but this is a neat aspect of this show that I like, the way the sometimes tweak the mythos, in this case with positive results. For me, it is a more realistic interpretation of the mythos, giving Lois real vulnerability and humanity.Upon careful re-watch of early SEASON 8, it's obvious that the show hadn't completely cut the ties to earlier seasons. Clark still wasn't over his first love Lana Lang (more on her later!). Early SEASON 8 eps slyly foretold (knowing Lana was to return for a brief mid-season stint that would end her storyline) that Clark needed a major life change to help push him to becoming what he was really meant to be. Also, early on, it was hard for Clark to let go of Chloe knowing that marrying Jimmy would change things between them forever. The Clark-Chloe and Clark-Lana subplots still have a lingering effect in early SEASON 8 eps (with only references to Lana since she still hadn't shown back up yet), and even weaker ones like 2-PLASTIQUE and 4-INSTINCT show Clark as being very guarded and emotionally distant and unsure of he is on the right path. Welling really gives a nuanced performance that illustrates that his version of Clark Kent is perhaps the most ""human"" of all incarnations. Yet throughout all of the early season, Clark was repeatedly given hints that he did have feelings for Lois, in some cases by people close to him (Chloe in TOXIC, his cousin Kara in BLOODLINE) and even outside forces sensed their deep connection that neither Clark nor Lois seemed to want to admit. Clark was still so emotionally fragile and grounded and Lois so stubborn and resolved, that they kept their feelings hidden.Moving toward the mid-part of SEASON 8, there is a 5-episode story arc (Eps 10-BRIDE, 11-LEGION, 12-BULLETPROOF, 13-POWER, 14-REQUIEM) that re-introduces the character of Lana Lang (admirably reprised by Season 1 to 7 regular Kristin Kreuk).  Kreuk had to honor her contract b/c she left 5 episodes early at the end of Season 7 to do a film. The first couple of episodes (BRIDE and LEGION) were smashingly good! Ep 10-BRIDE, the ep of Chloe and Jimmy's wedding, was a season standout with emotions running high between Lois and Clark and they are about to kiss at the wedding reception when Lana returns; then Lana and Clark had a great discussion scene about their tortuous relationship that is one of the most mature ones I've ever seen them have on the show; this scene illustrates how guilty and responsible Clark always felt about Lana and also that Lana didn't necessarily need Clark in her life to survive; then there was a truly horrifying Cloverfield-type scene with an attack by Doomsday on the wedding party, with Doomsday (under the influence of Brainiac) kidnapping Chloe; other results include Jimmy being seriously wounded and Lois deciding to accompany him to Star City for his recovery; so Lois leaving left the door open for Lana to insinuate herself back into Clark's life. Lana just kind of occupied space in 11-LEGION, the most purely entertaining episode of the season, with a trio of Legionnaires who returned from the future to help Clark find Chloe, who has been infected by Brainiac to take over the world. The plot of 12-BULLETPROOF (about bad cops) was weak, but the parts including or dealing with Lana were good, especially a key conversation between Chloe and Clark about Lana's return, Clark's inability to let go of her, and his unexpected feelings for Lois. It looked like Clana was going to end the right way! But 13-POWER (directed by co-star Allison Mack) was the most obvious worst episode of Season 8. It is a weird episode with poorly handled flashback scenes, terrible lighting, horrendous dialogue, and bad acting; it ""explains"" why Lana really left late in Season 7 and is really a poorly done retcon. Then there is 14-REQUIEM, a good episode with the return of an incapaciated Lex Luthor (a double for Michael Rosenbaum with tubes covering his face to mask him) pulling the strings as a Kryptonite bomb is about to destroy Metropolis. Lana had actually started to confront her inner demons in late Season 7 and Lana's departure in Season 7 made total sense based on the way that Season 7 shaped up, then the show's producers made the ridiculous decision to retcon it with the storyline of POWER, which to an extent betrayed and undermined both the character progressions of Lana (late Season 7) and Clark (early Season 8); the end scene of POWER shows Clark's growing doubt and confusion and Lana's misguided good intentions, but once again Lana intoxicates Clark and leads him astray; then REQUIEM pulls the doomed lovers apart forever. I feel the Lana arc SEASON 8 should have either (A) been done at the end of Season 7 (which unforunately was not possible), (B) been handled differently, or (C) not done at all. But at the end of the day, given that SMALLVILLE initially revolved around Clark, Lana, and Lex, I view this arc as the end of the old days of SMALLVILLE. For me, this arc just re-inforces the fact that Clark-Lana as a couple were for the most part a doomed relatonship, and when they were together, they were never really happy with each other and ultimately, just plain incompatibile. Their relationship started out sweet in early seasons, but degenerated into something very non-descript in later seasons; I think the final decision to end them the way they did was more a way to satisfy ""Smallville"" fans, since the show started with them, than to satisfy ""Superman"" fans, although there are a LOT of Smallville fans that actually don't like it, including myself!Understand that Lana Lang was Clark's FIRST love, but not his TRUE love (big difference!). At this point, although being very protective of and somewhat attracted to Lois, Clark didn't see the possibilities with her. Lois is a very gorgeous woman, but make no mistake, there is MUCH more to her than meets the eye! She is amazingly tough, resilient, ambitious, and forthright, but she is surprisingly vulnerable and sensitive at times also. What I like about the Clark-Lois dynamic on SMALLVILLE is that they literally complement each other to the point that neither of them knows it! Clark is able to penetrate Lois' tough exterior and see where she's really coming from and Lois activates Clark's protective instincts, but in a very positive way that makes him act more like a man. There were many times in prior seasons where Clark's overprotectiveness of Lana bordered on obsession and was almost one-sided where she would either accuse him of hiding secrets from her and wouldn't accept that he was just doing it out of love (the fact is, several times she was right!); this lingering mistrust spelled doom for their relationship! But with Lois, she accepts Clark for his humanity and just sees him as a truly nice guy with the best intentions. It's an amazingly refreshing twist on the mythology where Lois Lane is usually all starry-eyed for Superman and treats Clark Kent like utter crap! I much prefer SMALLVILLE's interpretation of Lois and Clark!Prior to SEASON 8, Clark-Lois were really frenemies who had unknown deep-seated feelings for each other that EVERYONE else could see, but neither of them could! Lois had been on the show for 4 full seasons by SEASON 8 and she and Clark had established as much of an important relationship (I'd say more important) than either of his relationships with Lana or Chloe (who Clark had also had a brief relationship with in Seasons 1 and 2), but Clark couldn't really see the big picture with Lois, only seeing her as a close friend and partner; and Lois kept her strong feelings for Clark deeply hidden and would always change the conversation between them when things got deep or intense; Lana always had his heart, but Clark could never really talk or be honest with her, while Chloe could totally relate to and converse with Clark, but Clark never had strong enough feelings for her other than friendship; the show did a brilliant job of showing the incompatibility of Clark and Chloe as a couple and that they were much better off as best friends; and Clark and Chloe never got involved deep enough for their friendship to ever seem awkward; the Clark-Chloe friendship is a major reason why SEASON 8 is so good, with Tom Welling and Allison Mack having to carry the show appearing in every episode, with the rest of the cast revolving around them and only appearing in limited fashion. But given her limited appearances, Erica Durance made the most of her portrayal of Lois Lane, proving that she could play the iconic character in her own special way and also why she is the perfect counterpart to Clark. Clark and Lois maintained their ""frenemy"" relationship in SEASON 8, but also injected it with a lot of sexual innuendo that indicated there were signs of real sparks and attraction. Welling and Durance just plain have that IT factor that is too strong to ignore!After Lana left, the show swiftly made up for the Lana arc with an immensely strong episode entitled 15-INFAMOUS, one of my faves of the season, revealing why LOIS is truly THE ONE for Clark! In this ep, Clark, compelled by evil down-and-out meteor freak reporter Linda Lake (guest star Tori Spelling in a fun, hammy, yet juicy performance, reprising her role from the Season 6 ep HYDRO) to admit to the world that he's the RBB, reveals his secret to Lois, but everything goes awry and Clark must use the time-travelling Legion ring (given to him in LEGION) to go back long enough to thwart Lake, but not before Lois bares her soul to Clark; it is Lois' big revelation where Clark Kent realized that SHE is his true soulmate, so the rest of the season has Clark beginning his quest to become the man and superhero worthy of a woman like Lois; his first priority is to protect Lois from knowing his secret at all costs to keep her safe, but also he doesn't want things with her to end the way they did with Lana; he decides to express his feelings for Lois as the RBB, so the show takes on more of the ""Superman"" vibe with Lois beginning to fall for the RBB and Clark having to bide his time to express his feelings for her, starting in Ep 19-STILETTO. Ep 17-HEX (where Chloe gets a wish to be Lois for a day) is a great one, with Erica Durance winningly mimicking Allison Mack as ""Chlois"" and Tom Welling matching her beat for beat playing the ""iconic"" version of Clark Kent. Later SEASON 8 also shifted more focus more on the Doomsday storyline with the powerful, tragic Ep 18-ETERNAL, a retcon ep explaining how Davis-Doomsday came to earth as a boy; we learn that Davis knew Lex Luthor as a child and there is a debate as to which one is truly Clark's worst enemy; as Chloe finds herself falling for Davis, but torn between her feelings for him and protecting Clark; thinking she has killed Davis with massive amounts of Kryptonite, turns out it only made Doomsday stronger and so Chloe opts to help Davis (to keep him from becoming the beast again) and they runaway together. Late SEASON 8 has Clark and the Justice League searching for Chloe and Davis and trying to defeat Doomsday. The season finale Ep 22-DOOMSDAY was sadly a disappointment overall, though, with a decision that actually managed to top the ones in POWER and REQUIEM in utter absurdity (although there is one VERY iconic scene involving Clark and Jimmy that is just plain AWESOME). Still, with the stories shifted to Metropolis over Smallville, SEASON 8 definitely has a more Superman appeal to it than prior ones.SEASON 8 regulars: Tom Welling, Allison Mack, Erica Durance, Aaron

1188683,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B001FB4VZS,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[6, 14]","Season 8 of ""Smallville"" had a lot of things going against it when it premiered in the fall of 2008. It had lost some major cast members. Michael Rosenbaum(Lex Luthor), and Kristin Kreuk(Lana Lang), did not return as cast members. If that weren't a big enough bomb being dropped on the show, the series' creators and runners, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, also left the show after the seventh season. Everybody was jumping ship, and I, as well as many other fans and critics, worried and wondering how the show would be without these major factors. How will it go on?. How will it work?. Will it be any good?. Throw in the news that two new characters would be added to the mix, and Justin Hartley would be upgraded as a regular cast member as Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and you had a new season that had many fans curious...and worried.Season 8(and I will be as spoiler free as I can)continues Clark Kent's path to becoming Superman, and we are getting closer and closer. He now works at The Daily Planet with Lois Lane(Erica Durance) and Jimmy Olsen(Aaron Ashmore), who is taking the next step in his relationship with Chloe(Allison Mack). Lex Luthor has mysteriously vanished, and in his place comes Tess Mercer(Cassidy Freeman)to run things. If Tess knows Lex and is running his business and living in his mansion, can she be trusted?. Elsewhere, we are also introduced to paramedic Davis Bloome(Sam Witwer), who is holding a deep, dark secret of his own.Okay, so after the fears and worries about season 8, how is it?. I am happy to say that fans' worries should be put to rest. Season 8 starts off a little rocky, a little unsure, but after a few episodes it really grabs hold of it's new storylines, characters, and just goes to town with it. The good news is that not only does it work, it works like gangbusters. The inclusion of villain Doomsday to the show was a great idea. The monster and his identity has been a fantastic surprise, and the monster himself is so cool and has a strong, powerful presence of evil that hasn't really quite been seen on the show. Chloe suddenly gets involved, and it goes to another level. There are a number of things going on, and it all gels. Al and Miles shouldn't worry. Their baby is in good hands. The Doomsday/Chloe/Clark thing is one of the best story arcs the show has had. I loved the last 2 seasons, but this storyline trumps those. There is a level of real danger this year, and it has sent the show some surprising shocks and surprises, not to mention pushing characters in new and surprising directions. Elsewhere, the show plays with the relationship between Clark and Lois. This also works really well. Tom Welling and Erica Durance have unbelieveable chemistry, and the sparks just fly whenever they are together. What ultimately happens between them remains to be seen, but I look forward to finding out. And for you Lana fans, yes, she does appear. Kristin Kreuk appears in five episodes, beginning with ""Bride"", and continues in ""Legion"", ""Bulletproof"", ""Power"", and ""Requiem"". But season 8 also belongs to Chloe as much as it does Clark. She has a lot of heavy stuff this year, and has gone through more than probably anybody else. What are the negatives?. Not much. I have never been a fan of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow, and I don't see adding Justin Hartley as a regular of really bringing much to the table. It seems like he and Clark have the same discussion a lot of the time.The episodes themselves are a lot of fun, and the season has a much darker tone this year than in seasons past. It begins with ""Odyssey"", which is a typical big Smallville premiere. Other highlights include ""Commited"", where Lois and Clark have to pose as a couple working on a case. ""Bloodline"" sees the return of cousin Kara(Laura Vandervoort)and the phantom zone. ""Bride"" is a biggie. Doomsday makes his big introduction to the gang during Jimmy and Chloe's wedding day. ""Legion"" features the, well, Legion, who help Clark with Chloe when Brainiac takes her over. ""Infamous"" sees the return of Tori Spelling(as hammy as ever)as gossip columnist Linda Lake. ""Beast"" and ""Injustice"" ramp up the series towards it's big finale, ""Doomsday"", which will be airing tomorrow night.""Smallville"" has had a creative re-birth in season 8. Not many shows can say that in their eighth season, but the new additions to the show have brought with them some very interesting new kinks in the story. The Doomsday storyline, and the complications with Chloe, have been some of the more interesting stuff the show has done. There are surprises, shocks, and characters being severely tested. While it would be nice for Lex and Lana to still be around, I have found myself really getting into this season's story, and I have not missed them. If the show can still be this good and entertaining with new producers and the loss of some favorite characters, while throwing in new dimensions for the story and characters, we should have nothing to worry about with season 9. Smallville is still flying high with one of it's most interesting seasons to date.",4,Countdown To Doomsday,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,5078,"['Season', '8', 'Smallville', 'had', 'lot', 'things',

1188688,A1E330XTGY2EP9,B001FB4VZS,brainiac723,"[0, 0]","With the departure of Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin Kreuk, AL Gough, and Miles Millar, Smallville was facing some of its greatest challenges yet. Despite the departures, Season 8 delivers big time. Growing up, I was always a huge fan of Smallville, but the show was not as respected by outside circles who criticized it for formulaic writing and acting. Season 8 in my mind made Smallville a more respected show in all circles. Previous seasons had some inconsistent filler episodes in between some fabulous premieres and finales, but this season had its most consistent episodes yet. What makes this season a step up from the previous seasons is the light and playful romance between lois and clark, which stood in stark contrast to the childish drama of clark and lana of previous seasons. Clark has FINALLY stepped up his game and has begun his duties as a hero by becoming the Blur. (lame name right?)Seeing CLark acting in a mature and heroic fashion was very rewarding. All the characters this season are given more depth as well, especially Lois. When Lois was introduced into the show in season 4 it seemed more of a publicity stunt to get more ratings instead of a good plot device. Lois has finally stepped up this season. While maintaining her sassy, bossy herself, Lois displays a more vulnerable side which has given her character more depth. We learn why Lois becomes attached to her career and why she develops a strong infatuation with the Blur. The unraveling of CHloe and Jimmy's relationship was a great plot arc as well as it showed the dark side of Chloe coming to the surface. In the middle of the season, Lana returns and closure is finally brought between Clark and Lana in a heartbreaking manner due to a teaming of an excellently portrayed Toyman and a vengeful Lex Luthor from the shadows.Another challenge, the writers had was introducing the comic book character DOomsday with a limited budget. By following the formula of ""showing less is more"" the Doomsday monster becomes a frightenting and intimidating threat. THe writers also developed Doomsdays human side in a efficient manner and in typical SMallville fashion, they show the character's downfall to circumstances.Although, the season is one of the best, it still has it flaws. The budget was limited this season and it is apparent in the sets which feel kinda cheap. Also, the final clash between Doomsday and Clark was underwhelming in comparison to its comic book and cartoon counterparts due to the limited budget. Also, a major character was written off in a cheap manner that screamed of bad contract negotiations that resulted in great backlash from the fans.

I will not be back for the 9th season. As a former review said, this season was more of the running in the same place.  Like being on a treadmill, but not going anywhere. Sure they introduced 'doomsday' and the future legion, but one of the things that make Superman what it is is the fantasy.  By trying to make it in the real world of regular people and life, it takes away what it should be. The 'doomsday' thingee was just aweful all season; stringing it along with no climatic finale. Chloe needs to go; Lana needs to go; Lois needs to tone down the attitdue(it's annoying to sound that confident).  Suit up and be done with it.  Maybe every 3rd or 4th episode even. It doesn't need to be for 5 minutes in each episode even.The new woman who took over for lex was stupid(the character). I never really liked lex anyway; so he's a smart guy who manipulates people and things.  Superman needs to go off into space and fight Mogul(the real comic book guy, not some stupid Smallville facsimile like 'doomsday') and tear some stuff up. I finally got too fed up with the whole destiny thing of Clark.  How long has it been that they don't want to move the character into what he is: Superman.  They don't even want to say the name, they toyed around it in that one episode. Utterlly frustrating.  Tom welling could have been in Transformes: Revenge of the Fallen, but he's stuck on this groundhog day of a show not going anywhere. I guess it's a steady job with good money, but please move on, he can do better. Since The Unit is cancelled, now all I'll have next season is 24 on Fox, Flashpoint on CBS, and Soutland on NBC.

1188697,AU2K7WFIIBWER,B001FB4VZS,"Damon A. Ekstrom ""dgekstrom""","[30, 45]","As most fans who watch this show are aware, the character Doomsday emerged this season.  However if your a fan of the comics, you will most likely wind up scratching your head as to why the writers are bringing in a character that is known the world over for killing Superman.  Especially considering this a show that has nothing to do with Superman, but an adolescent Clark.As usual, Doomsday's origins get the standard Smallville treatment in that it deviates far from the source material.  The writers decided that Doomsday would reside within a human host (that ""host"" being Davis Bloome).  Now as much as I would love to say that there was major character development within this season, I'm sorry to say that I am at a loss for words.  Aside from a stellar performance from Allison Mack (Chloe), the drivel that is written up about Doomsday/Davis is hokey at best.As stated earlier, Alison Mack delivers a roller coaster of emotions through her character.  Chloe, by far, has her worst season yet.  Her character encounters so much tragedy, that I'm amazed that Alison Mack was able to deliver so flawlessly.  All this tragedy stems from Chloe's interactions with Davis. The two share quite a bit of screen time together.  Not in a romantic way mind you, but more in a hostage kind of way.We also see the emergence of Tess Mercer, the temporary replacement for Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum left the show last season).  Now she may not be as evil as Lex, but she certainly is just as shady.  With season nine possbily being Smallville's last, it's obvious that there is little time or incentive to develop this character beyond a season or two.  Which is why Tess's actions will continue to speak louder than words.  So don't be surprised if this character exits just as quickly as she appeared.The writers also finally tie up the loose ends left over from Clark and Lana's relationship.  We finally find out why Lana taped the ""dear john"" video for Clark from last season, although I think this explanation arrives a season too late.  However it's through the result of that explanation, that the writers finally seal the end of the relationship.  Sadly, the writers put Lana in such an over the top predicament, that it comes off as just ridiculous (trust me when I say ""you have to see it to believe it"").  I would have preferred a coming to terms ending between these two characters that would have resulted in a powerful and emotional pivotal scene, in place of the debacle the writers came up with.Which leads us right back to Doomsday (which this season was centered around anyway).Throughout the season we saw much bickering between Oliver and Clark over how to go about ridding the world of Doomsday.  Do you kill Davis, thereby making the fight significantly easier, or take the moral high ground and try to save Davis?  It's not too difficult to figure out which option Clark chose.Now as you would imagine, there is a final showdown between Clark and Doomsday.  Unfortunately, it was weak at best.  The writers teased the audience for nine straight months, only to have this final fight last less than sixty seconds.  This was a major disappointment in my book.  You don't bring in the one and only character ever known to kill Superman, and have Clark not only win the fight, but have the battle run as short as it did.There is also a major twist in the season finale involving Jimmy, Chloe, and Davis.  The twist mostly involves Davis, but makes no sense based on the characteristic traits we have seen with this character thus far.  It's obvious that the writers were pushing for a surprise twist, but all season they kept leading their audience down a narrow path that resulted in the wool being removed from everyone's eyes in the eleventh hour.  The problem with this is that there were no visible signs that would have left the audience questioning their assumptions.  *SPOILER ALERT* -As if the Davis twist wasn't shocking enough, we learn that Jimmy wasn't really the James Olsen from the comic book.  Apparently he was Henry Olsen, Jimmy's older brother. Which begs the question, ""Was it really necessary to call him Jimmy?"".  And given how old the cast now is and looks, I was surprised when they revealed the real Jimmy Olsen to be no older than twelve years of age (I'm totally guessing, but he was a kid regardless).  I find it perplexing, yet also humorous that the writers go to great lengths to avoid the actor's ages. For example, Tom Welling (Clark) is 32 years of age, yet in the realm of Smallville we're supposed to believe he's only 21.  Look, Tom has aged well, but not that well.At the tail end of the season finale, we also saw the reemergence of Zod (again). It's safe to say that the well of ideas has run dry for Smallville. When you have an underpowered Clark defeating the likes of Lex Luthor, Bizzaro, Brainiac, Lord Zod, and Doomsday, it leaves little reason for Clark to become Superman. And since Clark has managed to go toe to toe with some of Superman's greatest villains, it wouldn't make sense to bring in a villain of lesser renown into the realm of Smallville for next season. Hence the reason why we have seen Brainiac on more than one occasion.This show is so far gone that I no longer hold that emotional attachment I once had. I thought the emergence of Doomsday was a bad idea, and my gut was right.  I can't speak for everyone, but I could care less about what the next season will bring.",2,A fall from greatness,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",2009,5453,"['most', 'fans', 'who', 'watch', 'show', 'are',

Their departure was so detremental that characters one had been following for the past 7 years up and turn a complete 180 from what you'd been seeing.  The writers clearly did not know what to do with the character of Chloe Sullivan, who has become a series fan favorite, and one sees her character that has long held a passion for reporting stumble through the series feigning a relationship with Jimmy Olsen and trying to figure out the arrival of Davis Bloome.  Also, the character of Lois Lane is contunually thrown in haphazardly into stories, with no clear arc other than the powers that be having to conform to comic book/movie history of having Lois & Clark pair up.  The strangest move yet was to have Clark Kent suddenly be thrown into the Daily Planet as a reporter when he had not even been working at the Planet, even part time.  It is a season that is filled with poor attempts to close storylines that had been carrying for the past 7 years while driving towards the train-wreck that was season 9.

I've watched all the previous seven years of episodes and the first twelve of season 8 but have seen precious few new ideas, just old ones rehashed with different characters.  Clark still loses his powers, constantly runs into kryptonite (and even keeps a box in the barn for some strange reason), ends up in the Phantom Zone and inevitably releases another monster, and finds yet another survivor of Krypton.  Characters continue to get possessed by alien entities, and love affairs always fall short of success.  The pressure for Clark to develop a Superman alter identity is foolish as presented.  For seven seasons he has been the football/super hero to whom everyone turns in a time of crisis, including adults.  He has saved every Smallville damsel in distress and, while he may be a nice guy, is anything but mild-mannered.  The double image Christopher Reeve portrayed so well just isn't possible in the Smallville setting.  Worse, the show continues to strain credulity.  No, I'm not talking about super powers.  You can't watch Superman and not accept that premise.  I have trouble with impossible human timelines.  I'm weary of seeing characters beaten to a pulp and the next day bouncing around like nothing happened.  Lois ends up in the Phantom Zone and - duh! - thinks it was all a dream.  How convenient!  Just how many times can you get knocked out, possessed, or kidnapped into other-worldly environments before you lose your sanity?  And they must develop a new street set.  They've doctored that insanely curved city street six ways from Sunday, but it's still obviously the same location.  It is not that anything in the eight season is bad, it's just that I've seen it all before in one form or another.

It's not as bad as I thought it was watching it on tv. The problems are many: Clark needs to grow up and step up to his fate. Clark needs to FLY. (To hell with that no flights no tights rule!) Clark needs to do less wrestling with his ethics and more wrestling with the bad guys. Basically the series needs less angst-y drama and more action. Just to be clear, the actors are doing a fine job, it's the plots I have a problem with.The biggest let-down for me was in the final episode. They spent ALL SEASON building up Doomsday, and when they finally let him and Clark fight, their fight only lasted ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY FOUR ****-ING SECONDS. And all Clark did was stuff him down a big shaft in the ground. Now Clark is abandoning his humanity. Again. And Zod is back. Again. --Sigh...In the plus column, I really like that Lois and Clark are starting to warm up to each other.. I have always liked Erica Durance in this role, I think she's perfect for it. She has so much attitude, just like Lois Lane should. I'm glad they've moved on from Lana, (at least, it seems like they have) because we all know she's not ""the one"" for Clark, so let her go. I am interested to see how that goes.So basically I think the show needs to have less drama and more action. Clark is about 22 by now, right? Kara could fly at 19? I think it's time to get him up in the air.

1188711,A6ZKAHCONUHX5,B001FB4VZS,Eugene Suh,"[1, 2]","Smallville: The Eighth Season was daring because it introduced the super-villain, Doomsday. I wasn't expecting that at all, since in the comics (as any true Superman fan knows), Doomsday ""killed"" Superman towards the end of the Superman comic book series (but later we're told, in the comics, that Superman was in a ""coma"" and later awakens from the ""coma"", so he really wasn't killed). Also, in the comics, Doomsday was never completely human; he was an experiment created by a Kryptonian scientist to be the ultimate being/destroyer/survivor. It's understandable, to some degree, why the writers/producers introduced Doomsday in this season; I'm guessing it's because they decided to play and have fun with the idea of Doomsday (aka Davis Bloome) being human and an EMT/paramedic who helps people and is unknowingly infected with the bug/virus that transforms him into Doomsday, since they ran out of ideas on who should take Lex Luthor's place as the main villain in this season 8.What was disappointing is that towards the end of this season (I believe the season finale), Doomsday/Davis Bloome is ""buried"" by Clark, but the questions remain at the surface: How did Clark ""bury"" Doomsday? Is Doomsday dead? Why hasn't Doomsday escaped/resurfaced and killed again? What is holding/preventing Doomsday from surfacing? The questions go on and on.This season 8 deserves 3 stars because:1. It was gutsy enough to introduce Doomsday so early on2. Lois Lane reveals she's in love with Clark Kent3. It shows Lex Luthor ""dead"" after being in a truck explosion (so it entices fans to guess what happened and is he really dead since, of course, Lex Luthor does not die in the animated series/movies/comics, etc.). This scene makes you wonder what really happened to Lex Luthor, when he's going to return to Smallville, and what he's going to do with Clark when he returns (maybe in seasons 9 and 10?).",3,"Interesting, but leaves a lot of questions",1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,1894,"['Smallville', 'Eighth', 'Season', 'was', 'daring', 'introduced', 'super-villain', 'Doomsday', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'comics', 'true', 'Superman', 'fan', 'knows', 'Doomsday', 'killed', 'Superman', 'towards', 'end', 'Superman', 'comic', 'book', 'series', 'later', ""'re"", 'told', 'comics', 'Superman', 'was', 'coma', 'later', 'awakens', 'coma', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'killed', 'Also', 'comics', 'Doomsday', 'was', 'never', 'completely', 'human', 'was', 'experiment', 'created', 'Kryptonian', 'scientist', 'be', 'ultimate', 'being/destroyer/survivor', 'understandable', 'degree', 'why', 'writers/producers', 'introduced', 'Doomsday', 'season', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'decided', 'play', 'have', 'fun', 'idea', 'Doomsday', 'aka', 'Davis', 'Bloome', 'being', 'human', 'EMT/paramedic', 'who', 'people', 'unknowingly', 'infected', 'bug/virus', 'Doomsday', 'ran', 'ideas', 'who', 'should', 'take', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'place', 'main', 'villain', 'season', '8.What', 'was', 'disappointing', 'end', 'season', 'believe', 'season', 'finale', 'Doomsday/Davis', 'Bloome', 'buried', 'Clark', 'questions', 'remain', 'surface', 'How', 'did', 'Clark', 'bury', 'Doomsday', 'Doomsday', 'dead', 'Why', ""n't"", 'Doomsday', 'escaped/resurfaced', 'killed', 'again', 'What', 'holding/preventing', 'Doomsday', 'surfacing', 'questions', 'go', 'on.This', 'season', '8', '3', 'stars', 'because:1', 'was', 'gutsy', 'enough', 'introduce', 'Doomsday', 'so', 'early', 'on2', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'love', 'Clark', 'Kent3', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'dead', 'being', 'truck', 'explosion', 'fans', 'guess', 'what', 'happened', 'really', 'dead', 'course', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'not', 'die', 'animated', 'series/movies/comics', 'etc.', 'scene', 'wonder', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'when', 'going', 'return', 'Smallville', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'Clark', 'when', 'maybe', 'seasons', '9', '10']",Smallville: Season 8

1188714,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B001FB4VZS,Flash,"[6, 9]","Smallville is one of those TV shows where I wait until it comes out on DVD before watching it. The reviews I had seen really had me worried that Season 8 was a big leftdown. I can tell you that it is not. It is actually pretty good (for the most part).Smallville Season 8 has some really good moments and it continues to build the Clark Kent/Superman character (abeit slowly). I was impressed with the freshness added with some of the new characters like Tess Mercer and Davis Bloom. I really enjoyed the building relationship of Clark and Lois. I have to say that Erica Durance really nailed the Lois Lane part in this season. Overall, the show finally seems to be moving toward something interesting, that being Clark's destiny to take up the role of Superman and start acting like him. The whole first half of this season, up until the episode called Legion was outstanding.That said. Things change when Lana Lang returns and then ends up sticking around for a while!! In my opinion, she should have left after just two espisodes (after Legion, which would have been perfect). But no, the whole Clark/Lana relationship thing has to flare up again. I am so sick and tired of this!. It never ends! I've gotten to the point where I can't stand the Lana Lang character. I find myself saying things to the TV screen like, ""JUST GO AWAY ALREADY!!!!"" Admittedly, the Clark/Lana thing WAS cute when they were in high school, but they should have ditched her character after Season 4. By far, this was the biggest mistake the writers and creators of this show ever made. The second was that the Lex Luthor character had way too much exposure and also became tiresome. For me, the fact that Lex is mostly absent from Season 8 is a good thing. But I would welcome him back as a villian when the time is right.That rant aside, Smallville Season 8 is still good. I would easily given it 4 stars instead of 3 if it weren't for Lana Lang. To be fair, I don't blame Kristen Kreuk. You can she really tries hard to make the best of what the writers give her. Unfortunately, the character is just laughable at this point.",3,"Don't blame Kristen Kreuk, but Lana Lang is so annoying!",1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2009,2106,"['Smallville', 'one', 'TV', 'where', 'wait', 'out', 'DVD', 'watching', 'reviews', 'had', 'seen', 'really', 'had', 'worried', 'Season', '8', 'was', 'big', 'leftdown', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'most', 'part', '.Smallville', 'Season', '8', 'really', 'good', 'moments', 'build', 'Clark', 'Kent/Superman', 'character', 'abeit', 'slowly', 'was', 'impressed', 'freshness', 'added', 'new', 'characters', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'Davis', 'Bloom', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'building', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'have', 'say', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'really', 'nailed', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'part', 'season', 'Overall', 'show', 'finally', 'be', 'moving', 'something', 'interesting', 'being', 'Clark', 'destiny', 'take', 'up', 'role', 'Superman', 'start', 'acting', 'whole', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'up', 'episode', 'called', 'Legion', 'was', 'said', 'Things', 'change', 'when', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'returns', 'then', 'up', 'sticking', 'while', 'opinion', 'should', 'have', 'left', 'just', 'two', 'espisodes', 'Legion', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'whole', 'Clark/Lana', 'relationship', 'thing', 'flare', 'up', 'again', 'am', 'so', 'sick', 'tired', 'never', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'point', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'character', 'find', 'saying', 'things', 'TV', 'screen', 'JUST', 'GO', 'AWAY', 'ALREADY', 'Admittedly', 'Clark/Lana', 'thing', 'WAS', 'cute', 'when', 'were', 'high', 'school', 'should', 'have', 'ditched', 'character', 'Season', '4', 'far', 'was', 'biggest', 'mistake', 'writers', 'creators', 'show', 'ever', 'made', 'second', 'was', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'character', 'had', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'exposure', 'also', 'became', 'tiresome', 'fact', 'Lex', 'mostly', 'absent', 'Season', '8', 'good', 'thing', 'would', 'welcome', 'back', 'villian', 'when', 'time', 'right.That', 'rant', 'aside', 'Smallville', 'Season', '8', 'still', 'good', 'would', 'easily', 'given', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '3', 'were', ""n't"", 'Lana', 'Lang', 'be', 'fair', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'can', 'really', 'hard', 'make', 'best', 'what', 'writers', 'give', 'Unfortunately', 'character', 'just', 'laughable', 'point']",Smallville: Season 8
1188715,A212BN81DP6FRI,B001FB4VZS,freelancer26,"[12, 21]","It seemed that the show's writers had two main objectives this season: 1)Fire up the chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling full blast and 2)Create and carry out a plausible introduction of Doomsday to Smallville. They accomplished both - a remarkable feat given that the ""genius"" in charge of actor contracts hired Erica Durance for a mere 12 shows out of 22! But this is a testament to Durance's talent and presence - she owns most of her scenes. Then on the Doomsday arc - it was clever the way they used the Pilot footage to integrate the Davis Bloom/ Doomsday character. I do think they went nauseatingly overboard with the use of Chloe in the Doomsday arc but thankfully, there was a payoff: (Fingers crossed) This season may mark the end of the uber-annoying hold Chloe had on Clark. I swear sometimes it seemed like Clark was Chloe's pet doggy and she scolded him whenever he displeased her and patted him when he obeyed her -oh, these lazy and cheap writers/producers - they consistently use the chloe character as a shortcut in plot points instead of using the more interesting but expensive comic book routes. Here's hoping this changes next season. One of my all out favorite exchanges from the finale is when Chloe tells Clark (paraphrased), ""It's the human emotions that have made you the hero that you are."" And Clark responds, ""It's those emotions that keep me from being the hero I could be."" Oh, snap! Hopefully, this really is the end of Smallville's watered down, couch-sitting, Hamlet-like version of Clark Kent and the producers will stay true to their word and move the show in line with the comics - which I hope includes getting rid of Chloe. Fine, don't kill her off but, please, get rid of her!! One character I was not sorry to see go was the queen-of-all-things-obnoxious, lana lang. I was heartbroken to see her back this season in five episodes. I took off one star for this terrible imposition the show runners forced on us. And, I totally agree with a previous reviewer in that her story arc was not only ridiculous, but laugh-out-loud insanely moronic! I, too, almost stopped watching the show because of this particular plot point. Seriously, Jimmy Olsen makes a more believable superhero than lang. Here's to this really and truly being the end of her! Speaking of Jimmy Olsen, I was briefly upset at the writers killing him off but, it was ... callously inventive how they introduced his little brother to be the ""real"" Jimmy Olsen who will become Superman's Pal and Lois Lane's sidekick. Aaron Ashmore has an endearing quality to him but he was too assertive to be the traditional young Olsen from the comics. I sincerely wish him all the best in all he is to do. I'm going to miss seeing him on the show. The scene he had with Lois in the finale was quintessential Lois and Jimmy. They really seemed to enjoy each other. Another thing I appreciated was how the writers used more of Superman's Judeo-Christian origin. Although, the analogies were sometimes much too blatant and extremely misused. For example, peterson comparing chloe to Mary Magdalegne - PLEASE, if the real Mary had been like her, the entire world would have been seriously screwed for all time!!All in all, I do say it is the best season of Smallville thus far due to the fact that Lois and Clark got good development in eleven of the twelve Lois Lane episodes. These particular moments are so good that I may actually buy this dvd set at the introductory price instead of waiting for the Christmas $15 sale. It seems that in the end, the multiple personality prone show runners thought this too - the DVD cover with Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet promotes the best this season had to offer and is my absolute favorite to date.UPDATE 8/27/09DVD Features:1. All 22 episodes in anamorphic widescreen on 6 discs - much better than the pan and scan full screen version shown on air.2. Two featurettes: In the Director's Chair w/ Mack and Doomsday-Making of a Monster - they couldn't have picked two more boring subjects3. Two very interesting commentaries on two episodes -""Identity"" (producer, director and Cassidy Freeman) and ""Legion"" (producers and writer).Episode List:1.Oddyssey: GRADE A-2.Plastique: B+ (deleted scene)3.Toxic: B-4.Instinct: B ...(deleted scenes) Focuses on Jimmy more than usual which he totally pulls off being the object of a super woman's affections and there's a really cool fight scene between her and Lois.5.Committed: A ...The look on Clark's face when Lois admits to loving him is priceless and the last scene in the elevator is fantastic.6.Prey: B-7.Identity: A- ...(commentary)8.Bloodline: A-9.Abyss: C-10.Bride: B ...In my opinion, the real ""Bride"" at the heart of the episode is Lois destined to belong to Superman despite the very unwelcome intrusion of the lang character. Honestly, they should have spared us.11.Legion: B- ...(wierd deleted scene and interesting commentary by comics writer Geoff Johns - he states his regrets about not getting to write for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen in this episode) The best non-Erica Durance episode of the season but not as solid as it could have been. Again, I agree with the previous reviewer when he said that lana lang almost managed to ruin it by showing her face.12.Bulletproof: D ...Why was chloe still in Smallville when her new husband, Henry James Olsen was in Star City recovering from near fatal wounds inflicted on him by his new wife's would-be lover, Doomsday? Lois was the one taking care of Jimmy just so her dear, sweet, considerate cousin can stick around all her helpless friends who just can't live without her incessant, ignorant, incompetent and often murderous meddling.13.Power: FAIL ...(deleted scenes) The butchering of Clark Kent's character and the ARC OF SUCK of lana lang in full swing courtesy of showrunners kelly souders and brian peterson, writers todd slavkin and darren swimmer and first time director alison mack. Either they were even more delusional than the lana and chloe fans or all their brains were buried in a crap infested toilet when they conceived this - it holds the shameful distinction along with Season 4's ""Ageless"" (another lang-worshiping episode as conceived by devoted worshipers al gough and miles millar though steven deknight took the blame) as the WORST EPISODE OF THE ENTIRE SERIES.14.Requiem: D- ...(deleted scenes) The only thing that saved it from being on par in idiocy with ""Power"" is that lana ""the girl next door turned Lex Luthor free-loader turned embittered, vengeful hypocrite turned Bizarro's skank turned insane thief turned giant turn off for Clark"" lang finally left the building. The exit from Clark's life that should have stuck happend in Season 5's ""Void."" It was an extremely moving scene played to perfection by Kreuk. I actually felt for Lana and hoped the writers would empower her from then on instead, the very next episode, they had her clinging to Lex and would repeat this sickening topsy turvey for THREE FULL YEARS until this sorry excuse for a story unceremoniously pulled the plug.15.Infamous: B+ ...Very, very special moments here. Unfortunately, this is where they decided to turn Davis Bloom into the Incredible Hulk without the heroics.16.Turbulence: C+ ...(deleted scene) And this is where they revealed Tess to be a total mess of a woman and where they did a 180 with (Henry) Jimmy Olsen.17.Hex: A ...(most interesting deleted scenes - there are several) The whole silly chloe-is-Lois obsessively DELUSIONAL fan theory is laid to rest. You'd think that 7 and 1/2 years would be long enough to hold on to their delusion but these very immature people just couldn't stomache accepting the fact that the icons Clark Kent and Lois Lane were NEVER created to have feeble phlegmatic temperaments.18.Eternal: C- ...(deleted scene)19.Stiletto: A ...The best episode of the season by far. We get Lois in a Catwoman/Huntress costume with Batman references galore and the real beginning of the legendary romance between Lois and Superman. They even used three notes of the John Williams penned theme song for Lois in the last scene. Very cool episode.20.Beast: D- ...(deleted scenes)21.Injustice: D- ...(deleted scenes) Tom Welling at his directorial worst, I'm sorry to say. This episode was TOTALLY POINTLESS. After viewing it the first time, it gave the impression that: 1)Oliver deeply cared for Tess, but then just a few episodes into the following season, he completely turned on her. 2)Tess is presented as a master manipulator, meticulously deliberate in every move she makes- following episode and for the entirety of season nine, she's shown to be completely clueless and bases all her decisions on pure emotion. 3)Chloe is played as a an uber-sweet, vulnerable, self-sacrificing victim of her own heroics... very next week, she's forever branded as the high priestess of delusional, narcissistic, egotistical, incompetent, murderously ignorant morons everywhere. 4)Clark seemed to actually have a solid grasp on who he is and what his purpose is then the very next episode, he declares himself to be more lost than ever - see what happens when you rely on little chloe to be your ""brain"" and ""best friend"" for eight freakingly loong years.22.Doomsday: D ...It was not as bad as I expected it to be and has actually got me excited for the next season or two. I'll bet that Lois and eventually Lex will turn up with some form of amnesia.The following is directed at those who are unfamiliar with this series but are considering buying this set: If you've read through most of the reviews, you've noticed that Superman fans are split into roughly four categories:1.The Comic Book Fan Boys (mostly boys): These are intimately familiar with Superman lore and so are simultaneously horrified and fascinated by this show. They are very vocal in complaining about the changes in the traditional Superman story but continue watching this show because they love the episodes that directly foreshadow the future assured incarnation of an unleashed Superman.2.The Generation Z Phlegmatics: These fans are the current young generation that were born between 1986-1995. Mostly, they know little if anything about Superman before ""Smallville."" So, actually, they are NOT Superman fans at all but merely ""Smallville"" fans with a penchant for the teen-age melodramatic, girly, idiotic, tragicly nonsensical romance stories the CW loves to serve them up. To them, Lana Lang is the love of Clark Kent's life and she should have never left the series. Or, if Lana had to leave then Chloe Sullivan should be Clark's bride. These have a special attachment to the manufactured Chloe character because she is one of them. Perhaps this is precisely why the show creators decided to invent this character - to speak directly to those who were teenagers and preteens when this show began. But wether they love Clana or Chlark, these fans have one thing that unites them: They all hate Lois Lane. They hate her because her character is nothing like them. They don't understand how this version of Clark Kent (whom the creators made out to be a phlegmatic-like character, at least for the first 3 seasons) can possibly fall in love with a woman like Lois - assertive, self-sufficient, irreverent and beautifully sexy with little insecurity - EXACTLY the type of woman the real Superman/Clark Kent (with his melancholic/choleric temperament) would fall hard for. The critical reviews with a 1-3 star rating are given by fans that fall into this or the previous category.3.The Superfriend Fan: This is what I call those that are not comic book fans per se but grew up watching or became interested in the animated versions of Superfriends and Justice League. They mostly just like DC comic book superheros and are not familiar or like very much the Marvel characters or any other comic book company inventions. These fans mostly ignored this show until about season 4, 5 or 6 when Smallville started looking more like its predecessors. They take this show for what it is - a new incarnation of a favorite fictional character. As long as the major points are hit, they don't mind this version too much (unless it's something as horrendous as the superlana arc!!!).4.Everyone Else: This is you. You've heard of Superman (how could you not?) and your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents grew up reading Superman Comic Books. When comic books were first invented in the 1930's until about the first half of the 1960's (what's considered the ""Golden Age"" of entertainment - before the dawn of the hippies and feminists and method actor take-over), reading comics was as common as reading the newspaper and were sold at all news stands for about the same price as a newspaper. Now, comic books are only sold on the internet or in specialty stores run by die-hard fans that scare off the general public for ridiculously high prices. Anyway, if you're reading this, it's probably because you like the Superman character and have become curious about this long-running show that is about the man-who-would-be. My advice: If you can easily afford it, go ahead and buy this set at the current $30-something price. You will be entertained and you'll love the classic 1940's style and feel to the sets and costumes - especially where Clark Kent and Lois Lane are concerned. If you're still unsure, wait for this to go on sale (it always does - usually within a year of release) for under $20. You won't regret this purchase. Ignore the negative reviews - as previously noted, they were made by disgruntled fans and not a true reflection of the high production quality of this show. Even if you don't much care for Superman, you will be wowed by the sizzling, sparkling, combustible chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling.",4,The Beginning of Mrs. Lois Lane Kent aka

It was fun to watch for all the signs, like the circle S in red and gold also happened to be the smallville highschool logo. It was fun! Now the later seasons are just overkill! Clark has worked for the Daily Planet, saved people, can sort of fly, has super powers, dated Lois Lane, broke up with Lois Lane, dated Lois Lane again, blah...blah...blah...Dear merciful heavens! Just give the man his tights already!Most people that rate this series higher than one star are probably just squinting so hard that the red jacket and blue jeans blur in their imagination and appear to be the super hero that we all once knew and loved. Sad.The fact is, Clark came of age, turned into a super hero, THEN got a job at a newspaper so that he knew what was going on in the city so he could save people. He didn't run really fast so he could leap high, all the while hanging out in a news office just so he could stare at Lois Lane, which in this series he has absolutely NO chemistry with.Overall it has good acting, but I wouldn't buy it. This story of ""superman"" has all but ruined the TRUE story. It's as if the writers/producers tried to make a work of art using fractured marble and hacked away at it with a dull hatchet.

1188721,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B001FB4VZS,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[0, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWIn this eighth season of ""Smallville,"" the series reinvents itself in a drastic manner in a way it really has not done since its third season.  Changes are both major and subtle, adding up to a welcome different tone for the show.For starters, Tom Welling's Clark Kent is finally not shying away from his superhuman side, though arguably his most famous power is still missing in action.  However, the eighth season premiere ""Odyssey"" finds him completely powerless in a harsh work camp.  In a maneuver that is at once head-scratching and smooth, the globetrotting Oliver Queen rescues him from the harsh overseer of the camp.  Oliver is again played very well by Justin Hartley, joining the main cast opening credits in this season.  Overall, the season premiere does a very nice job of pressing a reset button on the whole series and introducing a unique season.Three series stalwarts ended their time on the show as regulars in the seventh season:  Michael Rosenbaum, John Glover, and Kristin Kreuk.  Though Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor and John Glover's Lionel Luthor do not appear in the eighth season, Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang does.  Though most of the episodes she appears in as part of a mini-arc are very good(with two glaring exceptions called ""Power"" and ""Requiem""), the character was very tired and needed to simply fade away.To compensate for the losses of Rosenbaum and Glover, the show introduces two more antagonists in the form of Tess Mercer and Davis Bloome, played respectively by Cassidy Freeman and Sam Witwer.  The new CEO of LuthorCorp, Tess is given a meaty story that Cassidy Freeman acts very solidly.  Davis Bloome is a slightly less believable character because though Sam Witwer is unexpectedly brilliant, he gives away his hand much too early by the mood of his portrayal.Also featuring a controversial and frankly subpar season finale called ""Doomsday,"" and a world of relationship growth between Clark and Lois, the eighth season of ""Smallville"" is a nearly perfect rejuvenation of the series.",4,"A nearly perfect eighth season of ""Smallville""",1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,2044,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWIn', 'eighth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'series', 'drastic', 'manner', 'way', 'really', 'not', 'done', 'third', 'season', 'Changes', 'are', 'major', 'subtle', 'adding', 'up', 'welcome', 'different', 'tone', 'show.For', 'starters', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'finally', 'not', 'shying', 'away', 'superhuman', 'side', 'arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'power', 'still', 'missing', 'action', 'However', 'eighth', 'season', 'premiere', 'Odyssey', 'completely', 'powerless', 'harsh', 'work', 'camp', 'maneuver', 'once', 'head-scratching', 'smooth', 'globetrotting', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'harsh', 'overseer', 'camp', 'Oliver', 'again', 'played', 'very', 'well', 'Justin', 'Hartley', 'joining', 'main', 'cast', 'opening', 'credits', 'season', 'Overall', 'season', 'premiere', 'very', 'nice', 'job', 'pressing', 'reset', 'button', 'whole', 'series', 'introducing', 'unique', 'season.Three', 'series', 'stalwarts', 'ended', 'time', 'show', 'regulars', 'seventh', 'season', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'John', 'Glover', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'John', 'Glover', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'do', 'not', 'appear', 'eighth', 'season', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'most', 'episodes', 'part', 'mini-arc', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'two', 'glaring', 'exceptions', 'called', 'Power', 'Requiem', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'tired', 'needed', 'simply', 'fade', 'away.To', 'compensate', 'losses', 'Rosenbaum', 'Glover', 'show', 'two', 'more', 'antagonists', 'form', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'Davis', 'Bloome', 'played', 'respectively', 'Cassidy', 'Freeman', 'Sam', 'Witwer', 'new', 'CEO', 'LuthorCorp', 'Tess', 'given', 'meaty', 'story', 'Cassidy', 'Freeman', 'very', 'solidly', 'Davis', 'Bloome', 'slightly', 'less', 'believable', 'character', 'Sam', 'Witwer', 'unexpectedly', 'brilliant', 'away', 'hand', 'much', 'too', 'early', 'mood', 'portrayal.Also', 'featuring', 'controversial', 'frankly', 'subpar', 'season', 'finale', 'called', 'Doomsday', 'world', 'relationship', 'growth', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'eighth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'nearly', 'perfect', 'rejuvenation', 'series']",Smallville: Season 8

1188723,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001FB4VZS,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 1]","If only SMALLVILLE were as good some seasons ago... I've got a Benjamin Button thing going on with this series. The Justice Society of America episode compelled me to watch the rest of Season 9, and I liked Season 9 enough that I took a chance with Season 8, which is also watchable enough that I'll now be checking out Season 7.For all the myriad of sub-plots floating around in Season 8, really, there are two core story threads. One is Clark's assuming the role of Metropolis's mysterious guardian known insipidly as the ""Red-Blue Blur."" The other is the coming of Doomsday who, if you know your comic book history, once upon a time killed Superman.The show's biggest knock, I think, will always be that it took its sweet time getting Clark in the iconic costume. Maybe Lightning Lad says it best: ""No glasses? No tights? No flights? So far, he's nothing like the Man of Steel."" And Tom Welling is, what, fifty-seven years old now? Still, SMALLVILLE's getting closer to seeing eye to eye with Superman's established continuity. Clark Kent has made it to the Daily Planet as its mild-mannered and newest copy boy, a position which finds him working even more closely with Lois Lane. Clark theorizes that working at the Planet would give him a heads-up on criminal activity in Metropolis, and he's not wrong. Seems our boy scout Kryptonian is finally ready to embrace his true calling.This is also around the time that Clark begins to look at Lois in mushy fashion, and we also track Jimmy Olsen and Chloe's engagement and upcoming wedding. Cast regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk have amscrayed, although Kreuk returns for a few episodes. But new players step in. With Lex presumed dead, Tess Mercer becomes the new LuthorCorps CEO. The other new recurring character is Davis Bloome, a paramedic whose own arc ushers in Doomsday.More characters from the DC Universe are featured. In ""Instinct,"" the beautiful alien queen Maxima comes to Earth looking for a perfect mate, but her kiss is lethal. ""Hex"" introduces the reverse spell-casting Zatanna in a nifty tale in which she grants Chloe's wish to have Lois's life. SMALLVILLE's version of the Justice League shows up in ""Odyssey"" and ""Doomsday,"" including Green Arrow who takes on a semi-recurring role. The Martian Manhunter appears several times. Kara Zor-El returns in ""Bloodline.""But let's not kid ourselves. The jewel of this season is the terrific ""Legion"" episode which has the Legion of Super-Heroes time hopping from the 31st century to present-day Smallville to kill Brainiac. Comic book writer, the mighty Geoff Johns, pens the screenplay and manages to cling to the show's ""No tights"" policy, the Legionnaires stepping to Smallville sporting cool leather jackets that bear their individual, easily identifiable insignias. I love this episode. As they say, ""Long live the Legion.""Other favorite episodes: ""Stilleto"" in which Lois assumes a superhero identity. ""Infamous"" is a time travel/alternate reality tale in which Clark is forced to reveal his identity to the world with horrifying repercussions. ""Hex"" is a hell of a lot of fun, with Serinda Swan muy sexy as Zatanna.3.5 out of 5 stars for this season. Pretty good, but with flaws. Season 8 suffers from an inability to produce enough strong episodes and from Tom Welling's continued blandness (being so self-sacrificing is really annoying) and the unsatisfying season finale. Props, however, for the ever increasing influx of DC characters and for showcasing Brainiac in a bridal gown. With Rosenbaum gone, Allison Mack (""Chloe"") takes over as the cast's strongest actor, and I'm liking how Erica Durance is interpreting Lois Lane.

But they brought in Cassidy Freeman as Tess Mercer, the new boss of Luthorcorp, Sam Witwer as doe-eyed EMT Davis Bloome who unfortunately shares his body with the Kryptonian force of destruction known as Doomsday, and giving Justin Hartley regular screen-time as Oliver Queen aka Green Arrow.While having some great action and acting moments, the series sometimes suffers from the contrived deus ex machina of the conveniently unconscious friend/colleague/love interest whenever Clark needs to use his powers but keep his identity safe. But the worst one of all comes from one of the season's strongest episodes when members of the 31st century's Legion of Superheroes come to Smallville to help Clark out of a jam. They leave with him a Legion ring that will allow him to come forward in time to their century.In the season finale, ***SPOILER*** Lois grabs the ring and is whisked forth in time, and subsequently Jimmy Olsen is fatally wounded by Davis.Hmm... do you think that the show will break continuity with the Superman mythology, or is Lois somehow going to come back and be able to fix this major character's death?I guess we'll have to wait for Season Nine!",4,"A great season overall, but the finale is a little too convenient...",1243209600,"05 25, 2009",2009,1409,"['***MAJOR', 'SPOILERS', 'AHEAD***I', 'thought', 'season', 'SMALLVILLE', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'absence', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'who', 'think', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'was', 'major', 'highlight', 'performer', 'show', 'brought', 'Cassidy', 'Freeman', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'new', 'boss', 'Luthorcorp', 'Sam', 'Witwer', 'doe-eyed', 'EMT', 'Davis', 'Bloome', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'shares', 'body', 'Kryptonian', 'force', 'destruction', 'known', 'Doomsday', 'giving', 'Justin', 'Hartley', 'regular', 'screen-time', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'aka', 'Green', 'Arrow.While', 'having', 'great', 'action', 'acting', 'moments', 'series', 'suffers', 'contrived', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'conveniently', 'unconscious', 'friend/colleague/love', 'interest', 'whenever', 'Clark', 'use', 'powers', 'keep', 'identity', 'safe', 'worst', 'one', 'one', 'season', 'strongest', 'episodes', 'when', 'members', '31st', 'century', 'Legion', 'Superheroes', 'come', 'Smallville', 'help', 'Clark', 'jam', 'leave', 'Legion', 'ring', 'will', 'allow', 'come', 'forward', 'time', 'century.In', 'season', 'finale', '***SPOILER***', 'Lois', 'grabs', 'ring', 'whisked', 'forth', 'time', 'subsequently', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'fatally', 'wounded', 'Davis.Hmm', 'do', 'think', 'show', 'will', 'break', 'continuity', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'Lois', 'somehow', 'going', 'come', 'back', 'be', 'able', 'fix', 'major', 'character', 'death', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'Season', 'Nine']",Smallville: Season 8

1188735,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B001FB4VZS,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[6, 13]","In what I thought was the last season of Smallville actually wasn't and it's coming back for a 9th season next year. Michael Rosenbaum was a solid Lex Luther but I don't blame him for not returning for this season. I mean in his last years all they could think of doing with him was put him with Lana and have him look for a secret group that worshiped Clark. It's too bad that Kristin Kreuk had to make a 4 episode appearance though. I would have much rather have seen Rosenbaum back. The writers have always thought of bad new ways to overuse her character. A 4 episode appearance was a lot more painful than I was hoping for. Hell what was done with her almost made me want to stop watching the show. I'll just say they totally overdid it this time. If you think she has been used bad in the past, no way does it compare to how she was used in just 4 episodes!While when Lana was gone Chloe managed to get on my nerves this season instead. Sam Witwer plays David Bloome who right away has a huge crush on Chloe. It's silly how she is drawn to him too and how she takes his part over Jimmy and Clark who she has known a lot longer. Oh, plus David Bloome the pretty boy just happens to be Doomsday. That's right, the Doomsday in the comics that killed Superman. Only in Smallville would Doomsday be a pretty boy that has a crush on Chloe lol.So yeah what was done with Lana was beyond horrible and the Chloe and Doomsday stuff was a bit annoying too. Yet, the season did have plenty of good moments as well. Erica Durance is no doubt 100% Lois Lane this season. She has really become the character and the way Clark and Lois flirt and tease each other was just a delight to watch. Which made it a shame that she was totally pushed to the side and barely even mentioned in 3 of the episodes that Lana was in. Her scenes with Clark beats Clark all depressed saying ""oh Lana this, oh Lana that"" any day. Lois and Clark are fun together, Lana and Clark haven't been fun together since god knows when. They are just depressing and boring and I sure the hell hope she's not back in season 9, even if it is a small appearance.Lana even managed to almost ruin a near solid episode where Legion, a team of heroes come from the future to help Clark. Brainiac has taken over Chloe and they want to kill her and Clark doesn't. It was an awesome episode, that was until the girl in Legion tells Lana that she has a great destiny and Lana has a huge smile on her face like she knows she's all that. It was just painful to watch. Supergirl took a hike just so Lana could be told she has a great destiny ? What the hell ? lol.I should mention that Lex makes a very small appearance without Rosenbuam playing the part. But a sexy red head named Tess Mercer  (Cassidy Freeman) takes over the Luther mansion and the Daily Planet. She wants to find Lex and also find out everything there is to know about Clark. She also has a history with Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) since he once saved her life. I liked the addition of her but I do think the show does need Lex back in the last season.

Walker,"[13, 28]","Let me start out by saying that I have faithfuly watched Smallville since season one and have collected every season up until season seven.  I hate to say it... and I might get booed for it, but I think the show should have been canceled after season six.  Not abruptly canceled by the network, but the creators and producers of the show should have gave Smallville a proper ending.  Season seven wasnt as bad as season eight, but it was starting to show signs that the creators were running out of ideas and I feel like they were going to far with Clarks role as a superhero without him becoming the Superman that we know he was destined to be.  Now, before I break that down... let me tell you a little about myself.  I love comic books, but with 974 movies on shelf, I think its safe to say I'm a movie lover also.  What this means is, though I hate to see a movie about a comic book character change important details, as a movie lover I usually understand why that change was made.  In the begining I felt like Smallville was real respectable to both the comic book and even more so to the original Superman movies.  But the last few seasons they have really ignored that.  Main example is the appearance of Doomsday.  Really?  The monster that kills Superman makes an appearance on Smallville.  Okay, let me stop... I can go on forever.  Let me end by saying that season eight simply did not have me wanting to see what happen next.  I still have the last few episodes on my DVR, because I simply dont care to watch them.  There used to be a time when I wouldnt even have to record the episodes on my DVR... I had to watch it when I came on.  This show is now just real corny and I cant really see them fixing it.  Though I hate when my favorite shows are canceled, there are a few that end right and on good/powerful note.  I just wish Smallville had ended when it was still good, now I fear that the show will just fade away.

This was the first show I'd ever seen him on. People know him now from Being Human. Which he is also really good on. It's one of the most exciting seasons because Clark struggles with putting Lex down for good, (he and Green Arrow/Oliver Queen butt heads about it) then he has to contend with Davis, who is also Doomsday sent (at the same time as Clark) to earth to destroy it. So Davis is the hunky possible love interest for Cloe (who is engaged and soon married to Jimmy). But he's also this terrifying monster that can't be killed. Cloe seems to be the only thing that can keep the monster at bay, but after a while that doesn't work. So, Clark struggles with the decision because Davis is also a human and he refuses to take a human life. Lana comes back and even though they have a brief and hot reunion, she soon has to leave Clark again for his own good. I mean, there is so much going on, I watched it liked I'd never seen it before.

1188743,A2S9P70216QC2H,B001FB4VZS,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[0, 0]","*Warning May Contain Spoilers*Season Review-Even after seven years, Smallville was surprisingly going strong into its eighth season. After probably the worst season of the series (Season 7), not to mention the exit of show creators Al Gough and Miles Millar as well as long time cast members Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk, everyone pretty much agreed that Smallville's eighth season would be a sad and pathetic end for the series. But Season 8 proved to be one of the best seasons of Smallville in some time, probably the most consistent season in terms of story-telling and character development of the series since Season 3 even. Finally, Clark Kent wasn't just the farm boy from Smallville still unsure about his destiny and what he truly wanted in his life but a Clark Kent closer to his comic book counterpart. Clark gets some of the best story progression and character development in years as Clark is given two impressive storylines: 1)Clark joins Lois down in the basement as the Daily Planet's newest reporter. It's great seeing Clark investigating along side Lois Lane like the comics, especially the irresistible chemistry between the iconic duo. Tom Welling and Erica Durance breath new life into their performances this season with the hilarious banter and witty dialogue between Clark and Lois. 2) Clark decides to become Metropolis' newest hero, quickly getting the attention of the city and being known as ""the Red Blue Blur."" Both storylines are straight out of the comics and the most Superman inspired storylines the series has ever down.Other great storylines come with the arrival of two new characters: Cassidy Freedman as Tess Mercer, Lex's unofficial replacement/new CEO of Luthorcorp and Sam Witwer as Davis Bloome, a paramedic in Metropolis with a dark secret that not only threatens Clark but the world. Tess Mercer is a mysterious character, who spends most of her time looking for Lex but soon comes into her own as Tess' suspicions of Clark grow stronger, leading her to the truth. But while Tess' storyline is intriguing, it's Davis Bloome aka Doomsday that steals the show. When news broke out that the writers were going to introduce Doomsday to Smallville, many fans and critics thought it couldn't be done, even cringing at the thought. But for the most part, the storyline is probably one of the darkest and most entertaining storylines of the series. Sam Witwer is one of the best actors to grace the series, giving such incredible depth to the man behind the monster that will eventually kill Superman. The new show runners do a fine job of letting the storyline play out naturally, with each episode having a purpose, adding to the overall arc of the season. There are tons of great episodes to be found in this season like the suspense comedy ""Committed"", the dark and thrilling ""Prey"", the Supergirl send-off ""Bloodline"", Doomsday's epic debut in the wedding blockbuster ""Bride"", DC comic legend Geoff John's ""Legion"", Tori Spelling's return as Linda Lake in the ""what if"" episode ""Infamous"", the Zattana comedy ""Hex"", the twisted origins of Doomsday in ""Eternal"" and Lois' hilarious turn as a superhero in ""Stiletto"". Also, this is the most DC comics influenced season yet with dozens of comic characters introduced. Not only did we have the Justice League, Doomsday and Brainiac but also Maxima, Plastique, the Legion of Superheroes, the Persuader, Shadow Theif, Toyman, Dan Turpin, Parasite, Livewire, Bruno Mannheim, the Injustice League and more. We also got to see the other characters evolve and go through some of the darkest storylines they've ever been through. Like Allison Mack's Chloe Sullivan who is given the best story arc she's ever gotten as Chloe discovers she has a new power and one she thinks she can use to help Clark even more when it comes to saving the day. But the power is consuming her more and more by the day as she discovers it's really Brainiac gaining control of her body; planning to unleash his deadliest plan yet. This exciting story concludes in a fantastic three episode mini-arc (""Abyss"", ""Bride"" and ""Legion"") that sees terrifying flashes of Chloe's memories being ripped from her mind, Clark battling Doomsday for the first time and the Legion of Superheroes as well as The Persuader arriving from the future in an action-packed adventure. The only downside is that this is possibly the last decent storyline Chloe will ever get as during the second half of Season 8 (and especially during the current 9th season) the writers seem to not know what else to do with the character and her actions toward other characters have become harsh, even cruel. Justin Hartley's Oliver Queen/Green Arrow goes through a bit of a dark struggle during the beginning of the year but slowly becomes the hero we all love again. Aaron Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen is given a lot more depth this season than the past two as Jimmy is the one who discovers the mysterious saves of the Red Blue Blur and is an integral part of making his presence known to Metropolis. It makes it even sadder to see how ultimately Jimmy's story arc ends, but the beginning of it is some of the best material the character has ever been given. Last but not least, Erica Durance's Lois Lane is more front and center this season than the last few as she and Clark are working side by side as reporters and the character discovers that her feelings for Clark are more serious than she ever imagined. Her finest moments are without a doubt in ""Stiletto"", especially when Lois shares a very iconic scene with the future Superman that involves a telephone booth.But while Season 8 gave us some of Smallville's highest highs, it also gave us some of the series' lowest lows. First, the season starts off with impressive momentum, only for all of it to be abruptly stopped for the return of Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang in the embarrassing Super Lana arc. What makes this arc so lousy and unbearable is that instead of using Lana's final episodes to give the character a proper farwell, especially her romance with Clark that took up the last 7 years of the series. The writers decided to showcase Lana Lang as a superhero by giving her a super suit and becoming Clark's equal in almost every way. Excuse me...what!? The beyond abysmal ""Power"" and ludicrous Lana Lang send-off ""Requiem"" are two of the worst episodes the writers have ever written, feeling completely out of place in a season that was damn near superb at that point. Second, the Doomsday arc was such a deep and sometimes powerful storyline that many fans anticipated the final showdown between Clark and Doomsday in the season finale. In the now infamous ""Doomsday"", the fight between Clark and Doomsday was lacking in every sense of the word, not to mention, the unforgivable retcon they did to Jimmy Oslen undermined what the character had done since his debut in Season 6. It was hard to believe such a strong season could end on such a weak note. But this time luckily, the good outweighed the bad. All and All, Smallville's eighth season was an excellent return to form for this series for the most part. It's probably the most Superman-eqse season thus far giving us some truly iconic moments we'd never thought we'd see until Clark put on the tights.Season Rating: 8.5/10Video and Audio-All 22 Season 8 episodes look as clear and as sharp as ever in widescreen HD! The sound ain't half bad either.Video and Audio Rating: 8/10Extras-The box set only contains 2 commentaries (""Identity"" and ""Legion"") like the previous set which sucks because there are other episodes fans would love to see commentaries for like ""Abyss"" and ""Bride"". I know I would have loved a commentary for ""Prey"" (my personal favorite) Geoff Johns does provide some nice facts for the ""Legion"" commentary but it would be nice to hear from actors like Sam Witwer and Tom Welling hasn't done a commentary since Season 2's box set! The two special featurettes are also rather disappointing with Allison Mack's directorial debut documentary. While it's nice to see what went on behind the scenes, ""Power"" isn't exactly an episode you want to hear the cast and crew praise. The Doomsday suit documentary was also lacking and it would have been more interesting to hear more about the comic history of Doomsday as well as it's comic book creator Dan Jurgens.  The deleted scenes are passable at best.Extras Rating: 5.5/10Overall Score: 7.5/10",5,The Red Blue Blur and Doomsday is Coming-Smallville's Complete Eighth Season,1261008000,"12 17,

The snippets of the Superman superhero world begin coming alive a little bit, and the overall feel is that the series is finally heading somewhere -- albeit slower than desired. It seems there was a conscious effort to start addressing the DC universe, and at times this works out really well... but even a casual Superman fan like myself groaned at the way the last few episodes -- including the finale -- tried to incorporate more than it could handle. Absording the Doomsday character would've been great if they'd turned that last issue (er... episode!) into the knock-down drag-out fight such a character deserved. The main problem?

We see the death of two main characters (one good and one bad), the appearance of another woman interested in Clark (Tess Mercer), the return and departure of two important women (Lana and Kara), and the arrival of Clark's latest nemesis.  Along the way, the show touches on Clark's arrival on earth, his mission on earth, and how he goes about accomplishing this.  But the key theme of this season is the growing relationship between Lois and Clark, wonderfully played by both stars.  And the season begins and ends with a bang, both involving Tess Mercer.

The writing for these characters has become so mature! Clark FINALLY mans up & Lois Lane totally ROCKS! Tom Welling & Erica Durance are utterly fantastic as Clark Kent & Lois Lane! Their chemistry is undeniable! And the new villains Tess Mercer & Doomsday are awesome! Mercy is the Lex Luthor protege & she delivers an amazing subtle sinister ore that makes you know that something wicked is coming!Clark Kent has become such a man this year! I came so close to giving up on this show because of his constant whining & PINING over Lang! It's been refreshing to not have to sit through that up until the amazing and phenominal Bride episode. But no matter how fantastic the Bride episode is, it's disppointing that Lang's brief guest appearance brought that back & that the writers have allowed Clark to regress to his emasculated ways when around her.  The arc that they created for Lang is by far the most ridculous in the shows history, yes, even more so than the witch storyline.The only other bummer this season is what they have done to Supergirl. They poorly wrote her character then wrote her off the show. Supergirl is part of the Superman mythology & she deserves much better! I hope they bring her back as a regular & repair what they have done!One thing I'd really like to say is that DC Comics & Warner Brothers need to get over it & allow Wonder Woman & even Bruce Wayne to pop in since all these other background heroes have.Those things aside, this 8th season has massively ROCKED! I once again look forward to every new episode & more than that, I look forward to every scene with Clark & Lois together! Lois Lane is his future & destiny & the ultimate love of his life! I can't wait to see the legendary love affair begin! These writers have the opportunity to make them EPIC! I hope they do it! I truly hope that the show keeps going and going!

I still cannot wait until the dvd comes out for every new season.  I know it has changed over time, and is different every season but that is because actors get older, characters graduate high school and relationships change and grow.  When a show is this great, year after year, there's bound to be people who wish it was always the same, and therefore absolutely as great always because it is exactly the same.  Some episodes are better than others, and there are always growing pains in great shows but I don't see that as bad - every season is different for some reason or another.  But being a new fan who watched all seasons in one year, in a row, I see the changes and the growth all together at once and I absolutely love it.  I understand wanting it to be the same because it is so great from the beginning but to call for such a great show to be cancelled because it is different,  is just heartbreaking.  Real, true fans who don't like some episodes or seasons, can forgive and come back or just don't watch but I've had many favorites that drifted and then had episodes or further seasons that I loved.All too often great shows aren't even given a chance to air two or three episodes, much less two or three seasons to grow a decent fan base - or like this year in particular, many with good-even great ratings are cancelled for unknown reasons.  With the trash on tv these days, Smallville is miles above 99% of the shows and should certainly not be cancelled.  I give CW huge kudos for giving Smallville and Supernatural a chance, and keeping them on TV when there is such pressure to cancel anything that doesn't hit American Idol or Grey's Anatomy season 1 ratings because apparently networks tend to think if they aren't number one, the next show they try will most certainly be number one and therefore no matter how good, no matter how decent the ratings, if they aren't number one, they get canned without a second thought.  Unique shows, like Smallville and Supernatural are particularly vulnerable because they aren't yet another Law and Order or CSI.  I like CSI and L&O; but that doesn't mean I don't want some variety in my choice of shows.  I don't want a copy of every show that's popular, I just want great shows and I am so thankful to have that in  Smallville.  I love this show because it is different every week, has surprises that fit the show, and have terrific actors and characters.

The cast are still great for their character roles and seeing the cameo appearance of other super hero's like Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and the Green Arrow as well as Zantana were enjoyable too it still is a little annoying that Clark just doesn't get his famous tights and take the name Superman since it seems that every other thing in the Superman universe is here.

While not working on his desk on the Daily Planet or forging a special relationship with Lois Lane (Erica Durance), Clark Kent (Tom Welling) swoops to the recue as the helpful hero known as the Red-Blue Blur. Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman), the new CEO of LuthorCorp, searches for the missing Lex Luthor. The relationship between Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Jimmy Olsen (Aaron Ashmore) is threatened by the mysterious David Bloome (Sam Witwer) who struggles more and more to control the unstoppable beast within him. If you've been following the series, you'll know that it has many ups and downs but overall the eighth season proves to be more entertaining than the previous one. After the departures of cast regulars Kristin Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum, there was some concern if the series would hold up in this season. There are some interesting episodes and appearances of familiar DC Comics characters. The season-long story builds up nicely but the big climatic finish was somewhat ineffective.Any fan of ""Smallville"" will surely want to pick up their copy of ""Smallville: The Complete Eighth Season"". All 22 episodes of the eighth season are presented in a 1.78:1 anamorphic wide screen format. The picture quality is well defined with nice bright colors. Its 5.1 Dolby Digital audio is surprisingly dynamic. The menu screens look great. The 6-disc box set includes audio commentary tracks by series producers, writers and cast member Cassidy Freeman on two episodes (Identity & Legion), deleted scenes and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (In The Director's Chair: Behind the Lens and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack & Smallville's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster).

1188764,A16QODENBJVUI1,B001FB4VZS,Robert Moore,"[12, 25]","Except for a major stutter in mid-season, Season 8 of SMALLVILLE has been the best in several years.  The major problem with the show had long been the continuing gap between it and the traditional Superman mythology.  It was OK for this to happen for a while it was dealing with Clark's high school days, but after awhile they simply needed to get on with the story.  We've always known how it was going to end.  Or at least where a number of things would inevitably end up.  Lana would go away and Lois would take her place.  Clark would learn to fly.  He would become a superhero and embrace his destiny.  But for several years, while the show remained enjoyable, it felt more like the show was running in place than telling a story.  Season 8 went a long way to correcting this.  For instance, things really started heating up between Clark and Lois, and they turned out to far more chemistry than we had been given reason in previous seasons to hope.  In fact, I enjoyed few things in Season 8 as much as the scenes between the two of them.  And increasingly the show was brought in line with DC mythology.  In fact, the current producers have promised that the 9th season will move even closer to Superman.  And all I can say is, it's about time.As if to prove all this, the one real glitch in Season 8 came with the return of Lana in midseason.  The series had been moving along marvelously, with one delightful twist after another, all to come to a crashing halt when Lana came back to SMALLVILLE.  Mind you, I like Kristin Kreuk and think she is one of the cutest women in the world, but the whole Clark and Lana story got old a very long time ago and it was time to move on, not time to prolong it a bit longer.  Lana's goodbye in Season 7 should have been for good.  Worst of all, when Lana came back, Lois went away.  One of the most regrettable tings about Season 8 is that Erica Durance, despite being an opening credits character, was in fact only a halftime cast member.  I didn't count precisely, but my guess is that she was actually only in about half of the season's episodes.  For the show to move forward in Season 9, that needs to change.  They need to pull out their pocketbooks and pay Erica Durance for twenty-two episodes.  Hopefully they have realized this on their own.Season 8 saw a number of other DC additions.  We got additional tastes of the JLA in embryo.  We got Clark fully embracing a dual identity, as Clark on the one hand the Red-Blue Streak on the other, even wearing something of a uniform in the combo of his red or blue T-shirt and blue or red windbreaker.  He works at the Daily Planet as a reporter, sitting right beside Lois.  And he confronts during the course of the season one of the greatest Superman nemeses, Doomsday, who bears the distinction of having killed Superman in the comics.  Sharing the body of Davis Bloome, Doomsday remains somewhat under control, but when he becomes pure beast in the finale, he is pretty fearsome indeed.  For so long the show seems afraid to embrace the fact that this whole thing was about the Boy Who Becomes Superman.  Now that it is finally coming to terms with that, it has gotten better.I'm more excited about SMALLVILLE moving into Season 9 than I have in a long, long time.  With things between Lois and Clark becoming what it was supposed to be, with the show moving closer to the DC mythology (with one staggering exception, the death - or at least the apparent death - of a Superman universe staple), and with the new producers seemingly unafraid to move the story to new places, the show at this late date seems to be revitalized and full of purpose once again.  Even though Season Eight did not end on the kind of huge cliffhanger it has in the previous seven ones, but a sad, somber one, most things will inevitably go back to normal, or SMALLVILLE's version of normal, early in Season 9.",5,One of SMALLVILLE's best seasons in years,1242259200,"05 14, 2009",2009,3889,"['major', 'stutter', 'mid-season', 'Season', '8', 'SMALLVILLE', 'been', 'best', 'several', 'years', 'major', 'problem', 'show', 'had', 'long', 'been', 'continuing', 'gap', 'traditional', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'was', 'OK', 'happen', 'while', 'was', 'dealing', 'Clark', 'high', 'school', 'days', 'simply', 'needed', 'get', 'story', ""'ve"", 'always', 'known', 'how', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'least', 'where', 'number', 'things', 'would', 'inevitably', 'end', 'up', 'Lana', 'would', 'go', 'away', 'Lois', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'Clark', 'would', 'learn', 'fly', 'would', 'become', 'superhero', 'embrace', 'destiny', 'several', 'years', 'show', 'remained', 'enjoyable', 'felt', 'more', 'show', 'was', 'running', 'place', 'telling', 'story', 'Season', '8', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'correcting', 'instance', 'things', 'really', 'started', 'heating', 'up', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'turned', 'out', 'far', 'more', 'chemistry', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'reason', 'previous', 'seasons', 'hope', 'fact', 'enjoyed', 'few', 'things', 'Season', '8', 'as', 'much', 'scenes', 'two', 'increasingly', 'show', 'was', 'brought', 'line', 'DC', 'mythology', 'fact', 'current', 'producers', 'have', 'promised', '9th', 'season', 'will', 'move', 'even', 'closer', 'Superman', 'can', 'say', 'time.As', 'prove', 'one', 'real', 'glitch', 'Season', '8', 'came', 'return', 'Lana', 'midseason', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'moving', 'along', 'marvelously', 'one', 'delightful', 'twist', 'come', 'crashing', 'halt', 'when', 'Lana', 'came', 'back', 'SMALLVILLE', 'Mind', 'like', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'think', 'one', 'cutest', 'women', 'world', 'whole', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'story', 'got', 'old', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'was', 'time', 'move', 'not', 'time', 'prolong', 'bit', 'longer', 'Lana', 'goodbye', 'Season', '7', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'Worst', 'when', 'Lana', 'came', 'back', 'Lois', 'went', 'away', 'One', 'most', 'regrettable', 'tings', 'Season', '8', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'being', 'opening', 'credits', 'character', 'was', 'fact', 'only', 'halftime', 'cast', 'member', 'did', ""n't"", 'count', 'precisely', 'guess', 'was', 'actually', 'only', 'half', 'season', 'episodes', 'show', 'move', 'forward', 'Season', '9', 'change', 'need', 'pull', 'out', 'pocketbooks', 'pay', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'Hopefully', 'have', 'realized', 'own.Season', '8', 'saw', 'number', 'other', 'DC', 'additions', 'got', 'additional', 'tastes', 'JLA', 'embryo', 'got', 'Clark', 'fully', 'embracing', 'dual', 'identity', 'Clark', 'one', 'hand', 'Red-Blue', 'Streak', 'other', 'even', 'wearing', 'something', 'uniform', 'combo', 'red', 'blue', 'T-shirt', 'blue', 'red', 'windbreaker', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'reporter', 'sitting', 'right', 'beside', 'Lois', 'course', 'season', 'one', 'greatest', 'Superman', 'nemeses', 'Doomsday', 'who', 'distinction', 'having', 'killed', 'Superman', 'comics', 'Sharing', 'body', 'Davis', 'Bloome', 'Doomsday', 'somewhat', 'control', 'when', 'pure', 'beast', 'finale', 'pretty', 'fearsome', 'indeed', 'so', 'long', 'show', 'afraid', 'embrace', 'fact', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'Boy', 'Who', 'Becomes', 'Superman', 'Now', 'finally', 'coming', 'terms', 'gotten', 'better.I', ""'m"", 'more', 'excited', 'SMALLVILLE', 'moving', 'Season', '9', 'have', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'things', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'becoming', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'show', 'moving', 'closer', 'DC', 'mythology', 'one', 'staggering', 'exception', 'death', 'least', 'apparent', 'death', 'Superman', 'universe', 'staple', 'new', 'producers', 'seemingly', 'unafraid', 'move', 'story', 'new', 'places', 'show', 'late', 'date', 'be', 'revitalized', 'full', 'purpose', 'once', 'again', 'Even', 'Season', 'Eight', 'did', 'not', 'end', 'kind', 'huge', 'cliffhanger', 'previous', 'seven', 'ones', 'sad', 'somber', 'one', 'most', 'things', 'will', 'inevitably', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'SMALLVILLE', 'version', 'normal', 'early', 'Season', '9']",Smallville: Season 8

As for some of the story lines Season 8 spawned, I hate the fact that Lex was killed off even before Clark has donned the red and blue tights. Lex was a major enemy towards Clark. Bringing in the Tess character, and with Lex and Lana both gone I found the some of the stories weak and lacking excitement. The Lex character even though Mike Rosenbaum left, they should consider resurrecting his character to exact revenge on Clark(Superman).As for the Doomsday character in Season 8 they did well with that.

The Blu-Ray version may differ.For starters, the current release date is August 25, 2009.It'll include all 22 episodes from Smallville's eighth season, as well as the following features: cast & creator commentaries (including Geoff Johns for ""Legion""), unaired scenes, a featurette titled ""Smallville's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster,"" and another featurette called ""In the Director's Chair: Behind the Scenes and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack.""Awesome features for an awesome season.Now, on to my review...I've been a fan of the show since day one, but I wasn't expecting much from Season 8.This time around, Lex and Lana aren't recurring characters. Also, the original producers didn't return. To say the least, I was fearful.To my pleasant surprise, however, Smallville's eighth season has become my favorite yet. It's darker. It's edgier. Finally, Clark is making the transition from farmboy to superhero.Don't get me wrong. This season has its missteps, like any other in Smallville's history. But I'd say that, overall, this has been the most entertaining season yet. Here's why...- Clark is more heroic than ever- Chloe gets some spotlight for a change- The Lois and Clark relationship begins to blossom- Some loose ends are tied (Lex, Lana, Kara)- More input from the Justice League- The introduction of Tess Mercer, a worthy replacement for Lex- Sam Witwer as DoomsdayAnd let me repeat that. Sam Witwer as Doomsday.He successfully turns a 2D character with no personality into one of the most intriguing, exciting parts of Smallville history. I think I enjoyed his performances more than any others this season.Let those Season 7 wounds heal.Enjoy Season 8 of Smallville.",5,Arguably Smallville's Best Season Yet,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,1802,"['get', 'review', 'let', 'give', 'run-down', 'what', 'DVD', 'set', 'offer', 'according', 'KryptonSite', 'Blu-Ray', 'version', 'may', 'differ.For', 'starters', 'current', 'release', 'date', 'August', '25', '2009.It', ""'ll"", 'include', '22', 'episodes', 'Smallville', 'eighth', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'following', 'features', 'cast', 'creator', 'commentaries', 'including', 'Geoff', 'Johns', 'Legion', 'unaired', 'scenes', 'featurette', 'titled', 'Smallville', 'Doomsday', 'Making', 'Monster', 'featurette', 'called', 'Director', 'Chair', 'Scenes', 'Calling', 'Shots', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Awesome', 'features', 'awesome', 'season.Now', 'review', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'show', 'day', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Season', '8.This', 'time', 'around', 'Lex', 'Lana', 'are', ""n't"", 'recurring', 'characters', 'Also', 'original', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'return', 'say', 'least', 'was', 'fearful.To', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'however', 'Smallville', 'eighth', 'season', 'become', 'favorite', 'yet', 'darker', 'edgier', 'Finally', 'Clark', 'making', 'transition', 'farmboy', 'superhero.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'season', 'missteps', 'other', 'Smallville', 'history', ""'d"", 'say', 'overall', 'been', 'most', 'entertaining', 'season', 'yet', 'Here', 'why', 'Clark', 'more', 'heroic', 'ever-', 'Chloe', 'spotlight', 'change-', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'relationship', 'blossom-', 'loose', 'ends', 'are', 'tied', 'Lex', 'Lana', 'Kara', 'More', 'input', 'Justice', 'League-', 'introduction', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'worthy', 'replacement', 'Lex-', 'Sam', 'Witwer', 'DoomsdayAnd', 'let', 'repeat', 'Sam', 'Witwer', 'Doomsday.He', 'successfully', '2D', 'character', 'personality', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'exciting', 'parts', 'Smallville', 'history', 'think', 'enjoyed', 'performances', 'more', 'others', 'season.Let', 'Season', '7', 'wounds', 'heal.Enjoy', 'Season', '8', 'Smallville']",Smallville: Season 8

After all, she, NOT Lana, was the love of Superman's life. Lana was never more than Clark's high school girlfriend.  I agree with krypton kid's review, where he said the writers could have used the 5 episodes with Kristen Kreuk to allow Clark to see that he was really in love with Lois.  Instead, they completely cooled down a hot relationship with his head back into Lana, as if it wasn't for the krypton keeping them apart, he would have stayed with her.  Humbug!  This would have been a great way to have brought Erica Durance back in. Instead, there was no way you could believe Clark was in love with her after the 5 episodes with Lana. Made her seem like seconds. Of course, the fact that she was off the show for over a month after the terrific Bride episode was a big mistake, IMHO.So... I think the show didn't go where it could have gone. I was hoping to see Clark finally fly, Lois step up in their relationship (I loved the episode ""Committed"" where she has to admit to Clark that she loved him), and I would have liked to see them bring in Perry White. After 8 years, they can advance Clark's age a bit (they do not have to stick to a High School year per season mentality) and get him into the meat of being a hero. In the comic books, Clark was never so unsure of himself as Tom Welling is made to play him. I was more than fed up of seeing him so needy and insecure all the time. I was ready to see him become a force to be reckoned with.",3,I'm In Between,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",2009,1550,"['Season', '8', 'beginning', 'more', 'end', 'loved', 'where', 'things', 'were', 'going', 'Lois', 'NOT', 'Lana', 'was', 'love', 'Superman', 'life', 'Lana', 'was', 'never', 'more', 'Clark', 'high', 'school', 'girlfriend', 'agree', 'krypton', 'kid', 'review', 'where', 'said', 'writers', 'could', 'have', 'used', '5', 'episodes', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'allow', 'Clark', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'love', 'Lois', 'Instead', 'completely', 'cooled', 'down', 'hot', 'relationship', 'head', 'back', 'Lana', 'was', ""n't"", 'krypton', 'keeping', 'apart', 'would', 'have', 'stayed', 'Humbug', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'way', 'have', 'brought', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'back', 'Instead', 'was', 'way', 'could', 'believe', 'Clark', 'was', 'love', '5', 'episodes', 'Lana', 'Made', 'seem', 'seconds', 'course', 'fact', 'was', 'show', 'month', 'terrific', 'Bride', 'episode', 'was', 'big', 'mistake', 'IMHO.So', 'think', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'where', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'Clark', 'finally', 'Lois', 'step', 'up', 'relationship', 'loved', 'episode', 'Committed', 'where', 'admit', 'Clark', 'loved', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'see', 'bring', 'Perry', 'White', '8', 'years', 'can', 'advance', 'Clark', 'age', 'bit', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'stick', 'High', 'School', 'year', 'season', 'mentality', 'get', 'meat', 'being', 'hero', 'comic', 'books', 'Clark', 'was', 'never', 'so', 'unsure', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'made', 'play', 'was', 'more', 'fed', 'seeing', 'so', 'needy', 'insecure', 'time', 'was', 'ready', 'see', 'become', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned']",Smallville: Season 8

1188772,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B001FB4VZS,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[5, 8]","The cast returns for a new, and decidedly darker season of the runaway hit series.  After resolving last year's cliffhanger, Clark decides to leave Smallville behind and focus his energy on the Daily Planet, where he can more closely monitor the goings on of the crime-plagued city.  This, of course, means more time for Lois and Clark to gel.  Meanwhile, Tess Mercer steps in to steer the Luthor empire in the absence of Lex.  Oliver Queen returns to continue fighting greed and corruption with the still fledgling Justice League.  And Chloe embarks into some very dark territory in the increasingly tragic love triangle between her, Jimmy Olsen, and new character Davis Bloom.The producers effectively dodged the bullet of losing Lex from the show.  Cassidy Freeman is an excellent choice to pick up the mantle as Tess Mercer.  She is commanding on screen, strong in the right places, and also vulnerable in just the right measure at all the right times.  Justin Hartely (Queen) and Aaron Ashmore (Olsen) also bring much to the table with expanded roles this season.The biggest change is that these episodes are much more connected than in the past.  The major arc becomes a leading factor in almost every episode.  Indeed, this season of Smallville might be more aptly dubbed Splitsville, as in splitting the viewers.  On the one hand, there are those who feel this darker and more connected direction is the boost in the arm the show needed to stay fresh.  Then, there are others who miss the former days where each week was its own story, and the larger arc was more of a background factor, mostly relegated to mid-season and season finale episodes.  I can see both sides - there were moments when the epic nature of the season made me nearly forget the teen-angst ridden past it has risen from.  Yet I couldn't help but miss the more lighthearted touches of the former days.Indeed, this season has a serious lack of humor.  That's not to say it is wholly absent,  but it is rare.  Erica Durrance's fantastic work as Lois is too seldom utilized this season, and the episodes in which she is absent are harder and harder to get through as the season progresses. The few times she is allowed full reign are priceless, including STILLETTO, in which she assumes her own superhero identity to try to break a front page story, or HEX, in which Chloe inadvertently becomes Lois through a wish and a little magic.  Also fun is the return of Linda Lake (Tori Spelling) who forces Clark to reveal his secret to the world in the episode INFAMOUS.These ""fun"" episodes are rare respites in a season that is mostly focused on the brutal character of Doomsday, who is here from Krypton to destroy the world.  Finding out which human is Doomsday ultimately forces Clark to face his ultimate issue - can he kill a human to save the rest of humanity.  This deep issue consumes the entire second half of the season.  Along the way is a five episode arc that brings back Lana and gives a proper and creatively logical end to the relationship between her and Clark, which is itself consistently tragic for the season.  And the finale, while not quite as big as former finale's, does hint at some major changes to come.But of course, you cannot mention the finale without discussing what a major letdown it was.  Now, I don't judge it as harshly as others do.  As a tie up to the long running ethics discussion of the season, I actually thought it was pretty good.  The major shock near the end was, in my opinion, quite brilliant - and it made total sense in context of everything that people had been arguing with Clark about.  However, I will agree that the big showdown was woefully disappointing.  Far too short and lackluster.  When Clark and Doomsday landed at the power plant, I figured the gloves would come off and the BIG fight was about to start.  I was shocked when the screen faded to black.  WHAT!!?  This has been coming all season, the destruction of Doomsday, and we don't even see it!?But, even with this less than stellar final episode, I still think there is hope for the show yet.  They've had their season of ethical issues explored - they've recovered from the loss of Lex - and they've FINALLY rid the world of Lana Lang.  Now, what they need to do is let Season 9 be the end - which means in the course of the next season, Lois and Clark need to become dedicated reporters under the employ of Perry White.I'm not going to tell you this is an overall bad season, it's not.  There is still plenty to get out of it.  But I will tell you that it's probably the first season I wouldn't go back and watch again.  However, it might serve a larger purpose in being a catalyst for what comes in Season 9.  I just hope they can bring back the fun that the show used to revel in.",3,"We're not in Smallville, Kansas anymore!",1253232000,"09 18, 2009",2009,4777,"['cast', 'returns', 'new', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'season', 'runaway', 'hit', 'series', 'resolving', 'last', 'year', 'cliffhanger', 'Clark', 'leave', 'Smallville', 'focus', 'energy', 'Daily', 'Planet', 'where', 'can', 'more', 'closely', 'monitor', 'goings', 'crime-plagued', 'city', 'course', 'more', 'time', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'gel', 'Meanwhile', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'steps', 'steer', 'Luthor', 'empire', 'absence', 'Lex', 'Oliver', 'Queen', 'continue', 'fighting', 'greed', 'corruption', 'still', 'fledgling', 'Justice', 'League', 'Chloe', 'very', 'dark', 'territory', 'increasingly', 'tragic', 'love', 'triangle', 'Jimmy', 'Olsen', 'new', 'character', 'Davis', 'Bloom.The', 'producers', 'effectively', 'dodged', 'bullet', 'losing', 'Lex', 'show', 'Cassidy', 'Freeman', 'excellent', 'choice', 'pick', 'up', 'mantle', 'Tess', 'Mercer', 'commanding', 'screen', 'strong', 'right', 'places', 'also', 'vulnerable', 'just', 'right', 'measure', 'right', 'times', 'Justin', 'Hartely', 'Queen', 'Aaron', 'Ashmore', 'Olsen', 'also', 'bring', 'much', 'table', 'expanded', 'roles', 'season.The', 'biggest', 'change', 'episodes', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'connected', 'past', 'major', 'arc', 'leading', 'factor', 'almost', 'episode', 'Indeed', 'season', 'Smallville', 'might', 'be', 'more', 'aptly', 'dubbed', 'Splitsville', 'splitting', 'viewers', 'one', 'hand', 'are', 'who', 'feel', 'darker', 'more', 'connected', 'direction', 'boost', 'arm', 'show', 'needed', 'stay', 'fresh', 'Then', 'are', 'others', 'who', 'miss', 'former', 'days', 'where', 'week', 'was', 'own', 'story', 'larger', 'arc', 'was', 'more', 'background', 'factor', 'mostly', 'relegated', 'mid-season', 'season', 'finale', 'episodes', 'can', 'see', 'sides', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'epic', 'nature', 'season', 'made', 'nearly', 'forget', 'teen-angst', 'ridden', 'past', 'risen', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'miss', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'touches', 'former', 'days.Indeed', 'season', 'serious', 'lack', 'humor', 'not', 'say', 'wholly', 'absent', 'rare', 'Erica', 'Durrance', 'fantastic', 'work', 'Lois', 'too', 'seldom', 'utilized', 'season', 'episodes', 'absent', 'are', 'harder', 'harder', 'get', 'season', 'few', 'times', 'allowed', 'full', 'reign', 'are', 'priceless', 'including', 'STILLETTO', 'own', 'superhero', 'identity', 'try', 'break', 'front', 'page', 'story', 'HEX', 'Chloe', 'inadvertently', 'Lois', 'wish', 'little', 'magic', 'Also', 'fun', 'return', 'Linda', 'Lake', 'Tori', 'Spelling', 'who', 'Clark', 'reveal', 'secret', 'world', 'episode', 'INFAMOUS.These', 'fun', 'episodes', 'are', 'rare', 'respites', 'season', 'mostly', 'focused', 'brutal', 'character', 'Doomsday', 'who', 'here', 'Krypton', 'destroy', 'world', 'Finding', 'out', 'human', 'Doomsday', 'ultimately', 'Clark', 'face', 'ultimate', 'issue', 'can', 'kill', 'human', 'save', 'rest', 'humanity', 'deep', 'issue', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'season', 'way', 'five', 'episode', 'arc', 'back', 'Lana', 'proper', 'creatively', 'logical', 'end', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'consistently', 'season', 'finale', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'big', 'former', 'finale', 'hint', 'major', 'changes', 'come.But', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'mention', 'finale', 'discussing', 'what', 'major', 'letdown', 'was', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'as', 'harshly', 'others', 'do', 'tie', 'up', 'long', 'running', 'ethics', 'discussion', 'season', 'actually', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'major', 'shock', 'end', 'was', 'opinion', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'made', 'total', 'sense', 'context', 'everything', 'people', 'had', 'been', 'arguing', 'Clark', 'However', 'will', 'agree', 'big', 'showdown', 'was', 'woefully', 'disappointing', 'Far', 'too', 'short', 'lackluster', 'When', 'Clark', 'Doomsday', 'landed', 'power', 'plant', 'figured', 'gloves', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'BIG', 'fight', 'was', 'start', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'screen', 'faded', 'black', 'WHAT', 'been', 'coming', 'season', 'destruction', 'Doomsday', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'even', 'less', 'stellar', 'final', 'episode', 'still', 'think', 'hope', 'show', 'yet', ""'ve"", 'had', 'season', 'ethical', 'issues', 'explored', ""'ve"", 'recovered', 'loss', 'Lex', ""'ve"", 'FINALLY', 'rid', 'world', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Now', 'what', 'need', 'do', 'let', 'Season', '9', 'be', 'end', 'course', 'next', 'season', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'need', 'become', 'dedicated', 'reporters', 'employ', 'Perry', 'White.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'tell', 'overall', 'bad', 'season', 'not', 'still', 'plenty', 'get', 'will', 'tell', 'probably', 'first', 'season', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'again', 'However', 'might', 'serve', 'larger', 'purpose', 'being', 'catalyst', 'what', 'Season', '9', 'just', 'hope', 'can', 'bring', 'back', 'fun', 'show', 'used', 'revel']",Smallville: Season 8

Smallville has finally grown a pair.The only thing I craved for was to see more of the Justice League in this season... and when the H-E-double hockey sticks is Bruce and Diana showing up!?But all and all I want.... More Clark, Lois and big bads testing Clark's abilities!! (Along with solid good stories of course.) Anyone who is basicly male, a Clark AND Superman fan and holds a ratings box... jump on board for buying this DVD set and tuning in for season 9!TIVO and WATCH SEASON 9 ON FRIDAYS!",5,BEST SEASON..

1188779,AP3B615GM191G,B001FB4VZS,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[18, 30]","Right from the very beginning, one could see that the eighth season of ""Smallville"" would be very different from any of its predecessors.  Gone were regulars Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) and Kristin Kruek (Lana Lang), while other interesting characters such as Kara ""Supergirl"" Kent and Lionel Luthor would not be coming back.  In their place would be a new villain, Tess Murcer, and an increased focus on the Justice League (especially Green Arrow).Early on in the season, the show struggled to find its footing a bit, as could be expected from all the casting changes.  The Tess character was hit-or-miss, Green Arrow couldn't hold an episode by himself, and the ""freaks of the week"" (while nodding to the Superman comics) weren't that relevant or interesting to the development of the main characters.Starting with the episode ""Bloodline"" (early November), however, the Smallville writers were able to churn out a string of four high-quality episodes in a row.  Such topics as the creation of Doomsday (later Superman's most deadly foe), Chloe's relationship with Brainiac (featuring a great flashback Clark/Chloe scene), and Clark's future destiny (hinted at through time-travelling Legion members) were covered and all proved to be very interesting.  Plus, even the Clark/Lois relationship was actually starting to get entertaining and moving in a direction following the Superman cannon.  But then came Lana...Basically, right as the season seemed to be hitting its peak, the character of Lana Lang makes a guest appearance for a few episodes and everything comes crashing back down again.  Though the writers tried to give Lana a touching sendoff (as Kruek will not be returning), her character had been so emotionally void (what with her on again-off again relationship with Clark and Lex) for the past few seasons that this was just the last straw.  Sadly, what could have been one of the more touching scenes in Smallville history felt more like ""good riddance"".From that point, the entire rest of the season did not produce one episode I would consider to be anywhere near ""great"".  Though trying to make the Clark/Doomsday/Chloe triangle as dramatic as possible, it falls flat due to the fact that one show can only handle so many love triangles at one time.  Also, the Tess character (while decently acted) could not hold a candle to Lex, while the Justice League was never really fleshed out any more than in seasons six or seven.  Even the season finale (though it contained a few good moments) was disappointing, as I had to go read through the Kryptonsite message boards just to figure out what happened in the end (what was suppose to be the ""big revelation"" to set the groundwork for Season Nine).Thus, as much as I hate to say it, Season Eight of Smallville has been (at least so far) the weakest season of the show.  For the first time, watching Smallville every week seemed like a bit of a chore.  I will (like many of you) continue to watch the show until its conclusion, but sadly I do not think it will ever recapture the innocence of its first few seasons.",2,Much Disappointment Speckled With A Few Good Moments,1242345600,"05 15, 2009",2009,3084,"['Right', 'very', 'beginning', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'eighth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'different', 'predecessors', 'Gone', 'were', 'regulars', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Kristin', 'Kruek', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'other', 'interesting', 'characters', 'such', 'Kara', 'Supergirl', 'Kent', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'coming', 'back', 'place', 'would', 'be', 'new', 'villain', 'Tess', 'Murcer', 'increased', 'focus', 'Justice', 'League', 'especially', 'Green', 'Arrow', '.Early', 'season', 'show', 'struggled', 'find', 'footing', 'bit', 'could', 'be', 'expected', 'casting', 'changes', 'Tess', 'character', 'was', 'hit-or-miss', 'Green', 'Arrow', 'could', ""n't"", 'hold', 'episode', 'freaks', 'week', 'nodding', 'Superman', 'comics', 'were', ""n't"", 'that', 'relevant', 'interesting', 'development', 'main', 'characters.Starting', 'episode', 'Bloodline', 'early', 'November', 'however', 'Smallville', 'writers', 'were', 'able', 'churn', 'out', 'string', 'four', 'high-quality', 'episodes', 'row', 'Such', 'topics', 'creation', 'Doomsday', 'later', 'Superman', 'most', 'deadly', 'foe', 'Chloe', 'relationship', 'Brainiac', 'featuring', 'great', 'flashback', 'Clark/Chloe', 'scene', 'Clark', 'future', 'destiny', 'hinted', 'time-travelling', 'Legion', 'members', 'were', 'covered', 'proved', 'be', 'very', 'interesting', 'even', 'Clark/Lois', 'relationship', 'was', 'actually', 'starting', 'get', 'entertaining', 'moving', 'direction', 'following', 'Superman', 'cannon', 'then', 'came', 'Lana', 'Basically', 'right', 'season', 'seemed', 'be', 'hitting', 'peak', 'character', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'guest', 'appearance', 'few', 'episodes', 'everything', 'crashing', 'back', 'down', 'again', 'writers', 'tried', 'give', 'Lana', 'touching', 'sendoff', 'Kruek', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'emotionally', 'void', 'what', 'again-off', 'again', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'past', 'few', 'seasons', 'was', 'just', 'last', 'straw', 'Sadly', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'more', 'touching', 'scenes', 'Smallville', 'history', 'felt', 'more', 'good', 'riddance', 'point', 'entire', 'rest', 'season', 'did', 'not', 'produce', 'one', 'episode', 'would', 'consider', 'be', 'anywhere', 'great', 'trying', 'make', 'Clark/Doomsday/Chloe', 'triangle', 'as', 'dramatic', 'possible', 'flat', 'due', 'fact', 'one', 'show', 'can', 'only', 'handle', 'so', 'many', 'love', 'triangles', 'one', 'time', 'Also', 'Tess', 'character', 'decently', 'acted', 'could', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Lex', 'Justice', 'League', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'more', 'seasons', 'six', 'seven', 'Even', 'season', 'finale', 'contained', 'few', 'good', 'moments', 'was', 'disappointing', 'had', 'go', 'read', 'Kryptonsite', 'message', 'boards', 'just', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'end', 'what', 'was', 'suppose', 'be', 'big', 'revelation', 'set', 'groundwork', 'Season', 'Nine', '.Thus', 'as', 'much', 'hate', 'say', 'Season', 'Eight', 'Smallville', 'been', 'least', 'so', 'far', 'weakest', 'season', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'watching', 'Smallville', 'week', 'seemed', 'bit', 'chore', 'will', 'many', 'continue', 'watch', 'show', 'conclusion', 'sadly', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'recapture', 'innocence', 'first', 'few', 'seasons']",Smallville: Season 8

The start of the season is good, with chloe's wedding, but after that episode when Lana comes back, it tanks.I have watched Smallville from the beginning and I greatly enjoy it.

You could ask anyone who the villin in Superman/Smallvile is, I doubt they would say Tess Mercer, they would say ""Lex Luthor"".
