1041977,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,B000M2E31S,Bold Consumer,"[1, 2]","I found this to be a memorable story and especially loved the ending. I wasn't sure I liked it yesterday when I finished watching it, but then the story stuck with me. Often I'll watch a movie and the next day wouldn't be able to tell you what it was about. This story is one to remember, so I came back to edit my remarks and change the 4 stars to 5.The people in this story seemed for the most part to be good, decent, pleasant people trying to do the best they could with the resources they had. They seem to have a sense of humor, which made them more believable. You don't usually see that in novels of this time period where people are usually seen to be somber and often joyless. We might think most of the people in this novel have little to be joyful about, but they seem to think otherwise.There were no real villains. Each person was shown as they made decisions, good and/or bad, and the consequences of those decisions. I was sad to see one scene of villagers behaving badly, but history tells us that's the way things were back then. They held almost a Village Fair, with food and games, children holding little dolls with ropes around their necks. That was the most unpleasant part of the story, but it had an unexpected ending which made this novel memorable to me.In the beginning though, I was pretty much lost. The sound wasn't very good in the first few moments, and the accents were thick and hard to understand. Also, I wasn't sure where we were. I mistakenly thought maybe we were in a story about the Salem witchcraft trials, going by the clothing. For a moment I thought the opening courtroom scene was full of evil men, eager to condemn an innocent woman, reminding me of ""The Scarlet 'A'"" in fact. It was quite different than it seemed. At some point someone mentioned Methodists, which confused me further because Dinah appeared to be closer to a Quaker. I'll stop there so I don't have readers as confused as I was. I stuck with it and it all finally made sense.Once I had the background settled a bit, the story was interesting, and I enjoyed it. I thought Hettie was a little misplaced, but possibly that was the way it was intended. Picture a flirty girl in a red dress among other villagers all dressed in drab grays or wearing black and white.All of the characters were 'plain folk' other than the Squire and his family.  Hettie was a vulnerable young beauty who went from dressing and acting like a loose woman who wanted nothing more than to wear pretty clothes and be loved, to acting like a scared, hurt child. I never really developed much sympathy for her no matter what happened to her character throughout much of the movie, but at the end I wanted the best outcome for her and wondered how it worked out. I won't reveal that part of the plot, but mention is made of an infamous historical time and place connected with her future. It appeared that much of her problem may have been two things. She was too beautiful for her own good and not very smart.Dinah was a delight. I thoroughly enjoyed the part when Adam's mom very wisely let him in on a secret about women and then looked very proud of herself when he went rushing out the door. I wanted to cheer at that point or yell, ""It's about time!""  I suspect I would have cared even more about the other characters if I had read the book. I would have liked to have known more of the thinking of Adam's mom. I liked her.I watched it in one sitting, so I must have enjoyed it. I think the book would be worth the time to read it as well, and maybe easier to understand after watching this movie as a starter.",5,"A Strong Drama About Decisions and Consequences - Good, Decent People Doing Their Best",1272844800,"05 3, 2010",2010,3601,"['found', 'be', 'memorable', 'story', 'especially', 'loved', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'liked', 'yesterday', 'when', 'finished', 'watching', 'then', 'story', 'stuck', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'movie', 'next', 'day', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'tell', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'story', 'one', 'remember', 'came', 'back', 'edit', 'remarks', 'change', '4', 'stars', '5.The', 'people', 'story', 'seemed', 'most', 'part', 'be', 'good', 'decent', 'pleasant', 'people', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'could', 'resources', 'had', 'seem', 'have', 'sense', 'humor', 'made', 'more', 'believable', 'do', ""n't"", 'usually', 'see', 'novels', 'time', 'period', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'usually', 'seen', 'be', 'somber', 'often', 'joyless', 'might', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'novel', 'have', 'little', 'be', 'joyful', 'seem', 'think', 'were', 'real', 'villains', 'person', 'was', 'shown', 'made', 'decisions', 'good', 'and/or', 'bad', 'consequences', 'decisions', 'was', 'sad', 'see', 'one', 'scene', 'villagers', 'behaving', 'badly', 'history', 'tells', 'way', 'things', 'were', 'back', 'then', 'held', 'almost', 'Village', 'Fair', 'food', 'games', 'children', 'holding', 'little', 'dolls', 'ropes', 'necks', 'was', 'most', 'unpleasant', 'part', 'story', 'had', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'made', 'novel', 'memorable', 'me.In', 'beginning', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'sound', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'first', 'few', 'moments', 'accents', 'were', 'thick', 'hard', 'understand', 'Also', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'where', 'were', 'mistakenly', 'thought', 'maybe', 'were', 'story', 'Salem', 'witchcraft', 'trials', 'going', 'clothing', 'moment', 'thought', 'opening', 'courtroom', 'scene', 'was', 'full', 'evil', 'men', 'eager', 'condemn', 'innocent', 'woman', 'reminding', 'Scarlet', 'A', 'fact', 'was', 'quite', 'different', 'seemed', 'point', 'someone', 'mentioned', 'Methodists', 'confused', 'further', 'Dinah', 'appeared', 'be', 'closer', 'Quaker', ""'ll"", 'stop', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'readers', 'as', 'confused', 'was', 'stuck', 'finally', 'made', 'sense.Once', 'had', 'background', 'settled', 'bit', 'story', 'was', 'interesting', 'enjoyed', 'thought', 'Hettie', 'was', 'little', 'misplaced', 'possibly', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'intended', 'Picture', 'flirty', 'girl', 'red', 'dress', 'other', 'villagers', 'dressed', 'drab', 'grays', 'wearing', 'black', 'white.All', 'characters', 'were', ""'plain"", 'folk', 'other', 'Squire', 'family', 'Hettie', 'was', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'beauty', 'who', 'went', 'dressing', 'acting', 'loose', 'woman', 'who', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'more', 'wear', 'pretty', 'clothes', 'be', 'loved', 'acting', 'scared', 'hurt', 'child', 'never', 'really', 'developed', 'much', 'sympathy', 'matter', 'what', 'happened', 'character', 'much', 'movie', 'end', 'wanted', 'best', 'outcome', 'wondered', 'how', 'worked', 'out', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'part', 'plot', 'mention', 'made', 'infamous', 'historical', 'time', 'place', 'connected', 'future', 'appeared', 'much', 'problem', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'things', 'was', 'too', 'beautiful', 'own', 'good', 'not', 'very', 'smart.Dinah', 'was', 'delight', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'when', 'Adam', 'mom', 'very', 'wisely', 'let', 'secret', 'women', 'then', 'looked', 'very', 'proud', 'herself', 'when', 'went', 'rushing', 'out', 'door', 'wanted', 'cheer', 'point', 'yell', 'time', 'suspect', 'would', 'have', 'cared', 'even', 'more', 'other', 'characters', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'known', 'more', 'thinking', 'Adam', 'mom', 'liked', 'her.I', 'watched', 'one', 'sitting', 'must', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'book', 'would', 'be', 'time', 'read', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'easier', 'understand', 'watching', 'movie', 'starter']",Adam Bede

1041985,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,B000M2E31S,Judith,"[8, 8]","I've read the book, and seen this DVD.  Of course, the book is more detailed with more development of characters and storylines.  That is to be expected.  However, this production is true to the book.  I think people who have not read the book will enjoy this story, and who knows, may feel inspired to read the book.  I've certainly read many a book after seeing the TV program or movie.This is the story of Adam Bede, a salt of the earth working man in late 18th century England.  He is a hard worker, who tends to be intolerant of others faults, such as his father's drinking.  He fancies himself in love with Hetty, a dairymaid, but he doesn't know Hetty's true self.  Hetty dreams of fancy clothes and houses, but it's not possible to change your station in life in England in 1799.  Hetty's beauty also catches the eye of Arthur, the grandson of a nobleman.  He knows he could never marry her.  He struggles to resist temptation, but soon enough seduces Hetty, who is all too willing because he is handsome, wealthy, very charming and she is unrealistic.  Arthur truly loves Hetty, but of course, this cannot work out well for them.  Also, Dinah is visiting the village.  She is a sweet young woman who is too pious for her own good, as she believes anything she does to make herself happy is wrong in the eyes of God.This is a typically terrific BBC production.  Almost all of the parts are well cast.  I thought Susannah Harker played pious Dinah perfectly, and James Wilby did very well portraying the struggles and pain Arthur felt.  They were supported by an outstanding cast of character actors who really made the story come alive.  The minister and Hetty's aunt were particularly memorable characters.  The one miscast character was Hetty, played by Patsy Kensit.  Not that Patsy Kensit didn't do a good job of acting. She was miscast.  First, she doesn't look like an 18th century  farm girl.  They used too much eye makeup and lipstick, and something about the way she holds her mouth partly open says Debbie Does Dallas more than it does Masterpiece Theater.  I considered dropping my rating to four stars because of this miscasting, but everything else about it was so top notch that I went with five stars.",5,Masterpiece Classic,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",2009,2225,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'seen', 'DVD', 'course', 'book', 'more', 'detailed', 'more', 'development', 'characters', 'storylines', 'be', 'expected', 'However', 'production', 'true', 'book', 'think', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'enjoy', 'story', 'who', 'may', 'feel', 'inspired', 'read', 'book', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'read', 'many', 'book', 'seeing', 'TV', 'program', 'movie.This', 'story', 'Adam', 'Bede', 'salt', 'earth', 'working', 'man', 'late', '18th', 'century', 'England', 'hard', 'worker', 'who', 'be', 'intolerant', 'others', 'faults', 'such', 'father', 'drinking', 'love', 'Hetty', 'dairymaid', ""n't"", 'know', 'Hetty', 'true', 'self', 'Hetty', 'dreams', 'fancy', 'clothes', 'houses', 'not', 'possible', 'change', 'station', 'life', 'England', '1799', 'Hetty', 'beauty', 'also', 'eye', 'Arthur', 'grandson', 'nobleman', 'could', 'never', 'marry', 'resist', 'temptation', 'soon', 'enough', 'seduces', 'Hetty', 'who', 'too', 'willing', 'handsome', 'wealthy', 'very', 'charming', 'unrealistic', 'Arthur', 'truly', 'Hetty', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'well', 'Also', 'Dinah', 'visiting', 'village', 'sweet', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'too', 'pious', 'own', 'good', 'anything', 'make', 'herself', 'happy', 'wrong', 'eyes', 'God.This', 'typically', 'terrific', 'BBC', 'production', 'Almost', 'parts', 'are', 'well', 'cast', 'thought', 'Susannah', 'Harker', 'played', 'pious', 'Dinah', 'perfectly', 'James', 'Wilby', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'portraying', 'struggles', 'pain', 'Arthur', 'felt', 'were', 'supported', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'story', 'come', 'alive', 'minister', 'Hetty', 'aunt', 'were', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'characters', 'one', 'miscast', 'character', 'was', 'Hetty', 'played', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'Not', 'Patsy', 'Kensit', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'was', 'miscast', 'First', ""n't"", 'look', '18th', 'century', 'farm', 'girl', 'used', 'too', 'much', 'eye', 'makeup', 'lipstick', 'something', 'way', 'mouth', 'partly', 'open', 'Debbie', 'Does', 'Dallas', 'more', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'considered', 'dropping', 'rating', 'four', 'stars', 'miscasting', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'so', 'top', 'notch', 'went', 'five', 'stars']",Adam Bede

1041987,A1QFM9CFEUXZK5,B000M2E31S,Kendra,"[20, 23]","I disagree a bit with the other reviewers here (at the time of my writing, there are three).  I thought the movie was extremely well-done and I enjoyed every bit of it.I have not read the book, so I do not have that added perspective. I do think Adam Bede, the main character, is an upstanding moral fellow. I do not think he is so black and white as the editorial review suggests, that he cannot see shades of gray.  He is concerned not only for his own well-being, but is also concerned for those he loves, as well.  I did not take him to be so stuck in his moral absolutes, that he judged others unfairly.Adam loves Hetty.  Hetty is beautiful and aspires for something more than working in the  village. On the back of the box and maybe in the book, she comes across as selfish and vain.  In this movie, she comes across as wanting more than she has, but not out of selfishness or vanity, out of mild ambition and desire-- the same way most of us would want something more if our prospects were bleak.  However, this is Victorian England and the class system make this almost an absolute impossibility.  Hetty foolishly ignores the probability that an affair with an aristocrat will go nowhere, and she falls in love with the kind and handsome landowner.  She has an affair with him and gets pregnant, despite the fact that she's led Adam to believe she is interested in him and despite the fact that he loves her and intends to marry her.This is a heartbreaking and suspenseful film.  All the characters are likeable and the ""villain"" isn't really one person, it's a whole culture-- the class system and the obstacles one faces if he or she doesn't have a title and money behind him or her.Although there is no happy ending for Hetty, it's not as bad as it could have been (no spoilers here), and the end result seems fitting and bittersweet.Definitely recommended.",4,Excellent,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1869,"['disagree', 'bit', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', 'time', 'writing', 'are', 'three', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'it.I', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'added', 'perspective', 'do', 'think', 'Adam', 'Bede', 'main', 'character', 'upstanding', 'moral', 'fellow', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'so', 'black', 'white', 'editorial', 'review', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'shades', 'gray', 'concerned', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'well-being', 'also', 'concerned', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'be', 'so', 'stuck', 'moral', 'absolutes', 'judged', 'others', 'unfairly.Adam', 'loves', 'Hetty', 'Hetty', 'beautiful', 'aspires', 'something', 'more', 'working', 'village', 'back', 'box', 'maybe', 'book', 'selfish', 'vain', 'movie', 'wanting', 'more', 'not', 'selfishness', 'vanity', 'mild', 'ambition', 'desire', 'same', 'way', 'most', 'would', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'prospects', 'were', 'bleak', 'However', 'Victorian', 'England', 'class', 'system', 'make', 'almost', 'absolute', 'impossibility', 'Hetty', 'foolishly', 'probability', 'affair', 'aristocrat', 'will', 'go', 'nowhere', 'love', 'kind', 'handsome', 'landowner', 'affair', 'pregnant', 'fact', 'led', 'Adam', 'believe', 'interested', 'fact', 'marry', 'her.This', 'heartbreaking', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'villain', ""n't"", 'really', 'one', 'person', 'whole', 'culture', 'class', 'system', 'obstacles', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'title', 'money', 'her.Although', 'happy', 'ending', 'Hetty', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'spoilers', 'here', 'end', 'result', 'fitting', 'bittersweet.Definitely', 'recommended']",Adam Bede

Anyone who loves 19th century romance, will love this movie.Trust me!",5,Entertaining From Beginning to End!,1258416000,"11 17, 2009",2009,568,"['love', 'period', 'romances', 'one', 'hero', 'little', 'longer', 'discover', 'who', 'really', 'well', 'waiting', 'Susannah', 'Harker', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'brilliant', 'actress.I', 'give', 'movie', 'very', 'least', '5', 'stars', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'missed', 'years', 'Iain', 'Glen', 'was', 'also', 'supposively', 'bad', 'guy', 'Wives', 'Daughters', 'Keely', 'Hawes', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'bad', 'guy.In', 'Adam', 'Bede', 'much', 'younger', 'just', 'handsome', 'Anyone', 'who', '19th', 'century', 'romance', 'will', 'love', 'movie.Trust']",Adam Bede
