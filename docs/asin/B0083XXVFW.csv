The result is that most of the jokes come off flat.On the bright side, there are some truly amazing moments in this film, some jokes that flow perfectly and leave you laughing so hard you miss the next few lines.

1545650,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B0083XXVFW,Anthony L.,"[3, 5]","Part of the reason that ANCHORMAN 2: THE LEGEND CONTINUES is so bad is becauseAnchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundyis so damn good. Anchorman 1's quirky characters, offbeat performances and quotable dialogue all added up to one classy, rich mahogany-smelling success. Sadly all that is missing in this rote and middling, albeit sometimes-funny sequel.The entire cast returns, with some fine new additions. Whenever the movie succeeds, it does so on the strengths of its talented cast. The combined chemistry and comedic talents ofWill Ferrell, Paul Rudd, David Koechner, and especiallySteve Carrell(shouldering the brunt of the best laughs) are almost enough to make the movie work. Almost. The new additions do well; a smarmy James Marsden, an offbeat Kristen Wiig, and of course the mandatory slew of awesome cameos in the film's best scene - a direct ripoff of the news team brawl of the first film, this time featuring just about everyone from Jim Carrey to Liam Neeson.Anchorman 2 does best when it follows in the steps of it's predecessor, and that's a little sad. But when the film gives Ron Burgundy classy dialogue to say, or makes Brick freak out at his own funeral, and especially sees a half-dozen rival news teams brawl with pitchforks and minotaurs...it's almost enough to overcome the rote script, forgettable laughs, and lack of energy.But in the end, I found Anchorman 2 to be pleasantly diverting, and an amusing way to spend an hour and a half of my time. While not nearly up to the standards set by its predecessor, this is a middling comedy sequel that sometimes hits the mark. Mildly recommended.

The boys turn up at the new CNN parody with an overnight shift and go on a bender of misbehavior.  Somewhere shortly after they knock the ratings out of the park I gave up the ghost and went to sleep so I can't tell you if it gets any better.

High up in their ivory towers these cinematic experts don't read Forbes Magazine? In recent years Ferrell has claimed the top spot on Forbes &#34;Most Overpaid Actors&#34; list 2 times.They do a straight forward ratio of actor salary vs. box office take. For every dollar Ferrell earns in salary his movies earn $ 3.29. One article compared this to Shia LeBouf whose movies return $ 160.00 for every dollar he is salaried. I know that this is not exactly a fair comparison. Ferrell is working in comedy where LeBouf has had the benefit of a couple massive summer sci-fi movies. So I decided to check further.Two years ago IMDB (cthejtheizzo - 29 Mar 2012) came out with its &#34;50 Highest Grossing Comedy Films of All Time&#34;.

Another way to look at it is that it ONLY had 3 Ferrell films on in.He was beaten out by other top notch comedians like Robert De Niro who had four films listed. Even more telling was those films (of comparable release dates) that came in before his...&#34;Austin Powers&#34; before &#34;Elf&#34;...&#34;Wild Hogs&#34; before &#34;Taladega Nights&#34;....&#34;Paul Blart: Mall Cop&#34; way before &#34;Blades of Glory&#34;.Nationally syndicated columnist Liz Braun opinioned: &#34;Ferrell's biggest claim to fame, as far as we can make out, is that unlike other &#34;funny&#34; people, he doesn't even try to hide his contempt for you.&#34; She goes on to mention how Ferrell &#34;seems to have perfected the art of not being funny&#34;.

It worked.They're doing it again.  &#34;Anchorman 2, the Legend Continues&#34;, stars Will Ferrell, 10 years later, as TV newsman Ron Burgundy. But these days, things aren't so good. Burgundy is fired by the boss(Harrison Ford), and replaced by....his wife(Christina Applegate)! Burgundy becomes the tipsy announcer at Sea World in San Diego. Somehow, that doesn't fly. And then a producer offers Burgundy a midnight gig(2:00 AM) on up-start TV network GNN(think CNN), which plans to broadcast 24-hours-a-day. Huh? This is 1980. Nobody does that. Of course, the new format is a smash, with Burgundy reporting a live-feed cop-car freeway chase. He yells with excitement as the chase ends in a messy crash. He's a hit. It's 1980, and old school humor includes black people jokes, bad language and lots of ethnic slurs. Some of it works. Get ready for Steve Carell as a schizophrenic TV newsman(Brick Tamland). He is so off, that, if you yell at him, he whimpers, and hides behind the couch. Some of this is pretty funny, and Carell is either pretty good, or certifiable. Will Ferrell has struggled for a few years, after bombs like &#34;Land of the Lost&#34;, and has returned to TV(like &#34;30 Rock&#34;). He needs a hit.

Sure, the ""Toy Story"" films were an outlier, since the second in that series might have even been better than the first.  But here, Ron Burgundy proves that he's really just full of hot air.And this is quite a major disappointment, because when Will Ferrell is involved in a project, you expect it to be better than good.  It just seems that, if anyone can take a borderline subject and still make it entertaining, it would be Mr. Ferrell.It's almost as if Mr. Ferrell went to the Mike Myers school of filmmaking before this shoot.  Sure, a lot of people like Mr. Myers -- I find him to be a likeable guy, whatever that means -- but his ""Austin Power"" movies in particular became very tiresome with the overly-done sight gags and lazy jokes.  And ""Anchorman 2"" uses way too many sight gags itself, and one too many one-offs in an attempt to be funny.  Didn't work.Well, I did get quite a few cheap laughs here or there though, but most likely that's only due to the talents of one Ron Burgundy, err, Will Ferrell.  With little to work with, Mr. Ferrell still gave it the old college try, but after watching, it seems that his character never even graduated from high school.  Heck, this film might appeal only to zit-infested boys that are still in Junior High.I could easily go 2 here, or maybe even 1, but this film's still funnier than most of the drivel that Hollywood pumps out.

1545676,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B0083XXVFW,Chris Kennison,"[8, 14]","Will Ferrell's unprecedented run of promotion before the release of ""Anchorman 2"" was maybe not a reflexion of what ""Anchorman 2"" was, but what it was striving to be; epic comedy. He was everywhere, in character; and what an entertaining character Ron Burgundy turned out to be. The self-centered and deviously career-minded news journalist poked fun at the news business back in 2004 and the true success of ""Anchorman"" was not realized until the movie actually was released on video. So, producer Judd Apatow was determined to deliver some form of epicness to the Anchorman reboot.It was this attempt at epicness though, in my opinion, that left the movie less than it could have been. The early minutes of ""Anchorman 2"" are crafted well and the comedy is frequently side-splitting with an occasional dud. It is the dawn of the 24-hour news network and the very attempt at such a thing is drawing eye-rolls and hilarity from most of the 30-minute news world. So who better to make this 24-hour news network idea work, but Ron Burgundy and his team of dimwits including Brick (Steve Carrell), Champ (David Koechner) and Fantana (Paul Rudd).At some point though, the crafty gimmicks and effective jokes deteriorate into the overzealously bizarre. The story that was having so much success making intelligent hilarious fun of the way our world is over-saturated with news, opinion and some sort of weird place in-between, sort of got whacked in the head just like Ron Burgundy. At some point, it was like the writers ran out of crafty intelligent jokes and spent the final part of the film seeing how bizarre and over-the-top they could push it. Instead of delivering wit, they became obsessed with delivering epic.On top of trying to be epic, they got lazy, hammering the same gag time after time, over and over. Not to give any spoilers, but we get the hint, he doesn't know what he has in his hand and he can't feel that it isn't what he thinks it is. Even Brick's random unrelated comments got tiresome toward the end because it doesn't take much to come up with random comments, it's the crafty ones that require skill. Finally, the creators poured dozens of cameos, bizarreness and future guns into a finale that had me wondering how long the movie was and how much more was left.""Anchorman 2"" is not without tremendous writing and tremendous jokes that are crafty and bordering great satire, but it is also troubled with lazy jokes and monotonous silliness that gets old fast and just keeps happening over and over. Almost the entire final third of the film is like that friend that tells you an unfunny joke and you don't laugh so he tells you it again, and again, and again and it never gets better and you eventually check your watch and finally leave.",3,A 5-star beginning and an EXCRUCIATING ending,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",2013,2761,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'unprecedented', 'run', 'promotion', 'release', 'Anchorman', '2', 'was', 'maybe', 'not', 'reflexion', 'what', 'Anchorman', '2', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'striving', 'be', 'epic', 'comedy', 'was', 'everywhere', 'character', 'what', 'entertaining', 'character', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'self-centered', 'deviously', 'career-minded', 'news', 'journalist', 'poked', 'fun', 'news', 'business', 'back', '2004', 'true', 'success', 'Anchorman', 'was', 'not', 'realized', 'movie', 'actually', 'was', 'released', 'video', 'So', 'producer', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'was', 'determined', 'deliver', 'form', 'epicness', 'Anchorman', 'reboot.It', 'was', 'attempt', 'epicness', 'opinion', 'left', 'movie', 'less', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'early', 'minutes', 'Anchorman', '2', 'are', 'crafted', 'well', 'comedy', 'frequently', 'side-splitting', 'occasional', 'dud', 'dawn', '24-hour', 'news', 'network', 'very', 'attempt', 'thing', 'drawing', 'eye-rolls', 'hilarity', 'most', '30-minute', 'news', 'world', 'who', 'better', 'make', '24-hour', 'news', 'network', 'idea', 'work', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'team', 'dimwits', 'including', 'Brick', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Champ', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Fantana', 'Paul', 'Rudd', '.At', 'point', 'crafty', 'gimmicks', 'effective', 'jokes', 'deteriorate', 'overzealously', 'bizarre', 'story', 'was', 'having', 'so', 'much', 'success', 'making', 'intelligent', 'hilarious', 'fun', 'way', 'world', 'over-saturated', 'news', 'opinion', 'sort', 'weird', 'place', 'in-between', 'sort', 'got', 'whacked', 'head', 'just', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'point', 'was', 'writers', 'ran', 'crafty', 'intelligent', 'jokes', 'spent', 'final', 'part', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'bizarre', 'over-the-top', 'could', 'push', 'Instead', 'delivering', 'wit', 'became', 'obsessed', 'delivering', 'epic.On', 'top', 'trying', 'be', 'epic', 'got', 'lazy', 'hammering', 'same', 'gag', 'time', 'time', 'over', 'Not', 'give', 'spoilers', 'get', 'hint', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', ""n't"", 'what', 'Even', 'Brick', 'random', 'unrelated', 'comments', 'got', 'tiresome', 'end', ""n't"", 'take', 'much', 'come', 'up', 'random', 'comments', 'crafty', 'ones', 'require', 'skill', 'Finally', 'creators', 'poured', 'dozens', 'cameos', 'bizarreness', 'future', 'guns', 'finale', 'had', 'wondering', 'how', 'long', 'movie', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'was', 'left', 'Anchorman', '2', 'not', 'tremendous', 'writing', 'tremendous', 'jokes', 'are', 'crafty', 'bordering', 'great', 'satire', 'also', 'troubled', 'lazy', 'jokes', 'monotonous', 'silliness', 'old', 'fast', 'just', 'keeps', 'happening', 'Almost', 'entire', 'final', 'third', 'film', 'friend', 'unfunny', 'joke', 'do', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'so', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'never', 'better', 'eventually', 'check', 'watch', 'finally', 'leave']",N/A

Emotionally bereft and out of a job, Ron gets offered the chance to go to New York and partake in the bourgeoning 24 hour news scene.  He recruits his old partners and crimes and heads out...only to find the world isn't what he thought it was. He's not a big shot here.  And furthermore, stuck in the graveyard shift (&#34;I ain't afraid of no ghost&#34;), he's suddenly confronted with a dilemma: to report the news...or report things people will actually listen to?ANCHORMAN is one of the great comedies of the past couple decades.  Hell, it may be one of the great comedies of all time. It defined a generation. If you don't know a line from it, you're wrong--you know one, you just don't know it's from that movie.  ANCHORMAN 2 has two great flaws: one, it tries to be as good as the first; and two, it was originally released a PG-13.  This is hard-R material (thank God there's the R-rated version; my immediate instinct on seeing the film for the first time was that the trailer had all the funnier jokes), and deserves hard-R delivery.  Some of the jokes are stale; others are just blatantly vulgar, utterly missing the point of what made the first film so hilarious (the jokes in the original were both crude AND charming).  Also, as Steve Carell's fame has risen, so has Brick Tamblan's role.  Brick is hilarious as a supporting character; given his own subplot, Brick becomes a little too much (though as a foil for Carell's character, Kristen Wiig is spot-on).But, when the film hits, it hits.  Case in point: the cameos.  Oh Lord, the cameos.  From A-listers you wouldn't expect to show up for 15 seconds.  The film starts out with one (most reviews I read gave it away, but I won't), and then just piles them on.  Extended supporting turns from Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate, Meagan Good, James Marsden, Greg Kinnear, and the above-mentioned Wiig are great (especially the original crew, who haven't lost their chemistry).  And Ferrell, surprisingly, is still game; his performances are hit-and-miss for me, and here he's not quite as good as in the first, but it's still a funny performance, with just a touch (perhaps too much) of heart.  The jokes come fast and hard; they don't all click (dare I say, more fail than most), but the film gets stronger in its third act.Ultimately, ANCHORMAN 2 is an unnecessary sequel; and, if you're going to give us a sequel to such a seminal film, make it stand on its own two legs.  ANCHORMAN 2 does not.  But it's worth your time; if you enjoyed the first, watch this one, especially the R-rated version.  In fact, only watch that version.  You won't laugh as hard as you did a few years ago, but you might still have a damn fine time.",4,A little Ron Burgundy always goes down smooth,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2014,2773,"['1970s', 'are', 'gone', ""'ve"", 'left', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'crew', 'behind', 'Emotionally', 'bereft', 'job', 'Ron', 'offered', 'chance', 'go', 'New', 'York', 'partake', 'bourgeoning', '24', 'hour', 'news', 'scene', 'old', 'partners', 'crimes', 'heads', 'out', 'only', 'find', 'world', ""n't"", 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'shot', 'here', 'furthermore', 'stuck', 'graveyard', 'shift', '34', 'ai', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'ghost', '34', 'suddenly', 'confronted', 'dilemma', 'report', 'news', 'report', 'things', 'people', 'will', 'actually', 'listen', 'ANCHORMAN', 'one', 'great', 'comedies', 'past', 'couple', 'decades', 'Hell', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'comedies', 'time', 'defined', 'generation', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'line', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'know', 'one', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', '2', 'two', 'great', 'flaws', 'one', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'PG-13', 'hard-R', 'material', 'thank', 'God', 'R-rated', 'version', 'immediate', 'instinct', 'seeing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'was', 'trailer', 'had', 'funnier', 'jokes', 'hard-R', 'delivery', 'jokes', 'are', 'stale', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'blatantly', 'vulgar', 'utterly', 'missing', 'point', 'what', 'made', 'first', 'film', 'so', 'hilarious', 'jokes', 'original', 'were', 'crude', 'AND', 'charming', 'Also', 'Steve', 'Carell', 'fame', 'risen', 'so', 'Brick', 'Tamblan', 'role', 'Brick', 'hilarious', 'supporting', 'character', 'given', 'own', 'subplot', 'Brick', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'foil', 'Carell', 'character', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'spot-on', '.But', 'when', 'film', 'hits', 'Case', 'point', 'cameos', 'Oh', 'Lord', 'cameos', 'A-listers', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'show', 'up', '15', 'seconds', 'film', 'out', 'one', 'most', 'reviews', 'read', 'gave', 'away', 'wo', ""n't"", 'then', 'just', 'piles', 'Extended', 'supporting', 'turns', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'James', 'Marsden', 'Greg', 'Kinnear', 'above-mentioned', 'Wiig', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'original', 'crew', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'chemistry', 'Ferrell', 'surprisingly', 'still', 'game', 'performances', 'are', 'hit-and-miss', 'here', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'still', 'funny', 'performance', 'just', 'touch', 'perhaps', 'too', 'much', 'heart', 'jokes', 'come', 'fast', 'hard', 'do', ""n't"", 'all', 'click', 'dare', 'say', 'more', 'fail', 'most', 'film', 'stronger', 'third', 'act.Ultimately', 'ANCHORMAN', '2', 'unnecessary', 'sequel', ""'re"", 'going', 'give', 'sequel', 'seminal', 'film', 'make', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'legs', '2', 'not', 'time', 'enjoyed', 'first', 'watch', 'one', 'especially', 'R-rated', 'version', 'fact', 'only', 'watch', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'laugh', 'as', 'hard', 'did', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'might', 'still', 'have', 'damn', 'fine', 'time']",N/A

Like the second Austin Powers movie, this is a sequel that doesn't even fight to escape from the shadow of its predecessor. Rather than pressing on with new gags in the same spirit as the original, it simply revisits the spots that worked last time and expects us to react the same way. That feels fake to me, forced and empty and criminally over-scripted. Half the fun of the first Anchorman came from appreciating the improv brilliance of its players, riffing on each other and going above and beyond in an effort to make their buddies break character. That's completely lost this time around, giving way to winks and nods and lame attempts to capture lightning in a bottle by striking the same poses all over again. The magic's gone, and though a few firm laughs do rear their head from time to time, they're nowhere near as powerful nor as free-form as the team's first rodeo.

1545709,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B0083XXVFW,FNDNreview,"[1, 3]","What can you possibly say about Ron Burgundy that hasn&#8217;t already been said? The short answer is nothing. But, for those of you that don&#8217;t know Mr. Burgundy, he is best described as being a charming, outspoken individual that oozes charisma and attracts the ladies like nobody&#8217;s business. Did I mention he&#8217;s also the best news anchorman in the business? Burgundy, along with his news team and co-anchor girlfriend, Veronica Corningstone, conquered the San Diego airwaves, begging the question: what will they conquer next?Nearly ten years since the release of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, director (and co-writer) Adam McKay reunites with the film&#8217;s star (and co-writer), Will Ferrell, for the sequel, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues. Since the conclusion of its predecessor, the sequel picks up with Ron and Veronica (Christina Applegate) now married, with a son, and living in New York City. And, rumor has it they might be moving into the prime-time news slot. Unfortunately for Ron, it&#8217;s Veronica that&#8217;s promoted to the coveted slot, while Ron is promptly fired and called the worst anchorman in history. Begrudged, he ultimately gives Veronica a choice: it's either him or the job. Take a guess how that goes&#8230;With his marriage on the rocks and down on his luck, Ron eventually receives some good news when he&#8217;s paid a visit by Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker), who asks Ron to come work for an upstart 24-hour news network (which was a laughable idea when it was initially proposed). Excited to be back in the business, Ron sets out to reassemble his news team, who have all scatter since he last saw them. Despite their current, new-found occupations, Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), Champ Kind (David Koechner), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell), are all more than happy to join Ron on his quest to dominate the Global News Network (GNN).Now back working in New York City, Ron quickly discovers he&#8217;s no longer the &#8220;hottest&#8221; thing in town. His new rival, Jack Lime (James Marsden), is the big man on campus. However, Ron Burgundy always has a way of making the news exciting and quickly dominates the airwaves once more &#8211; leading to a bigger ego, a new girlfriend, and copious amounts of friction with his news team. However, just when you think Ron can't get anymore egotistical, he is surprisingly humbled and sent into a tailspin when he loses his ability to read the news.In the event that you weren't impressed by Will Ferrell's performance in the original Anchorman (like me), this sequel will quickly reverse your opinion. Ferrell, whose humor is mostly childish and borderline ridiculous, continues with that trend. Some scenes are funnier than other, but he never fails to provide even the slightest chuckle. One particular scene, in which he accompanies his new girlfriend, Linda Jackson (Meagan Good), to dinner at her family's house is a particularly frighteningly embarrassing scene &#8211; yet it works well for Burgundy's unfiltered character.Make no mistake about it &#8211; this film is dominated by the presence of Ferrell's alluring portrayal as Ron Burgundy. However, quite a bit of screen time is also allotted to Steve Carell's mentally-challenged character, Brick Tamland. Honestly, the more I see of Carell in feature films, the more I enjoy him. While he may have had quite a few fans that wished he stayed longer on The Office, it's become abundantly clear he belongs on the big screen. Carell's co-stars, however, don't necessarily benefit from this sequel. Neither Paul Rudd or David Koechner stand out here, and are basically just along for the ride. Most moviegoers don't see enough Koechner, so that's a shame, but as far as Rudd goes, his career continues to explode regardless.To be fair to the script, this Anchorman sequel is anything but predictable &#8211; taking countless twists and turns that you'll never expect. You won't anticipate Ron's rebound from losing his job as fast as he does (taking place in the opening scenes), but sure enough, Ron surprisingly takes GNN to new, unprecedented heights. Like current news networks, this film's subplot becomes all about dominating the ratings, and the moguls that run them. In comedic fashion, the film doesn't hold back any punches when sending shots towards the current state of the news media &#8211; which are full of fluff pieces, car chases, and telling viewers exactly what they want to hear.So, here's the biggest question surrounding this sequel: is it as good or better than the first film? Well, that depends on your love for the first film, really. If you casually enjoyed The Legend of Ron Burgundy, then this sequel will feel like what you'd expect out of a sequel. However, die-hard fans might feel differently. The jokes are about the same, meaning you'll get a full does of WHAMMY, plus several similar parallels to the first film. One of those parallels is another major battle between rival news organizations, which is full of humorous cameos &#8211; including Tina Fey, Liam Neeson, and Kanye West (for reasons beyond comprehension). Don't worry, I neglected to mention the best cameos.Even though this sequel is filled with plenty of funnies, it really doesn't accomplish anything earth-shattering like its predecessor. In fact, this sequel feels about 20-30 minutes too long, and clearly incorporates several scenes that were unnecessary or just carried on far too long. The news brawl-for-all, for instance, could have been much more cut n' dry, but with the abundance of cameos and the attempt for them to all get in a line or two simply drags the progression of the film down to a stand-still. The opening half-hour where Ron has to get his team back together is also an area that was too long and add next to nothing to the story.Overall, Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues is an admirable sequel to a film many fans consider to be a gem. However, while this film does progress the story of Ron Burgundy, there's really nothing monumental about it. You simply get more of the same nonsense (racism, sexism, etc.) that's associated the late 1970s and early 80s. At the same time, we should all thank the lucky stars that an Anchorman sequel was even made. For years, news kept making the rounds that a sequel was dead and the likelihood it would ever happen was minimal at best. But, here we are with one sequel under our belts and ready for another.GRADE: C+FNDNreview.com",4,"'Anchorman' sequel average, but a welcome addition",1387497600,"12 20, 2013",2013,6469,"['What',

Of course the movie was boring ten minutes in.American comedy requires no brains generally. The more idiotic you act, the bigger audience you have. Think Sarah Silverman and her unfortunate visit to the UK.

If however you find that sort of tripe utterly transparent, avoid this.Will Ferrell has carved out a niche and fair-play to him.

1545727,A2BFIYZYNK54QX,B0083XXVFW,"James Donnelly ""Ave Atque Vale""","[3, 5]","Let me first preface this by stating that I am not a Will Farrell fan. I don't find most of his work particularly funny, but if there's one exception that I could make, it's ANCHORMAN: THE LEGEND OF RON BURGUNDY. It's a film that does get funnier as time goes on, and that it's actually something of a smartly-designed film and sometimes brilliantly satirizes some serious issues with newscasting. In the original film, it was the introduction in the mid-Seventies of women anchors. It was surprising to see a broad and juvenile comedy that actually had something to say, albeit in a very roundabout way. And it also didn't hurt to have a great supporting cast in the likes of Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Fred Willard, and Steve Carell. So director Adam McKay and Farrell and the original cast have returned several years since the first film to reunite for another outing with the news crew with ANCHORMAN 2: THE LEGEND CONTINUES.The film opens in the early Eighties with co-anchors Ron and Veronica Corningstone (Farrell and Christina Applegate) happily married with their seven-year-old son Walter, and now working in New York. But things fall apart when senior anchor Mack Harken (Harrison Ford, in something barely more than a cameo) retires and chooses Veronica as his replacement, and names Ron one of the worst reporters in history. After splitting with Veronica, Ron flounders in a drunken stupor back in San Diego, and is approached by Freddie (the great Dylan Baker), who is looking for newscasters for a 24-hour news network. Ron then gathers the gang of reporter-turned-pet-photographer Brian (Rudd), sportscaster turned fried-bat-restaurant-owner Champ (Koechner), and weatherman and decidedly not-dead Brick (Carell) to join him in NY. Once there, they end up with the graveyard shift of 2-5am, with the prime-time slot belonging to Ron's immediate nemesis, uber-handsome Jack Lime (James Marsden), and they meet their tough female African-American boss Linda Jackson (Meagan Good). While planning for the night shift, Ron comes up with the brilliant idea that instead of telling the people what they SHOULD hear on the news, they instead break with journalistic integrity, and decide to build their newscast on what the people WANT to hear. This sets off a firestorm of ratings, an interracial relationship between Ron and Linda, Brick meeting the perfect woman for him (a PERFECT Kristen Wiig), and Ron's hubris getting the best of him as he alienates everyone and inevitably falls from grace. But with the help of Veronica and Walter, he looks to get back on his anchor-horse, but not before he and the newsteam have to throw down against Lime's cronies and upstarts from other new 24-hour cable channels in the climactic battle royale fashion of the first film, with some incredible cameos.Firstly, the criticisms. The film, for the most part, is something of a retread of the original. There isn't much new here to see, and some of the jokes, particularly when they all meet Linda for the first time, fall pretty flat due to repetition and flat-out theft; the restaurant scene with Ron and Linda has moments lifted from the first AUSTIN POWERS film. Some cast members are horribly wasted: Harrison Ford could easily have been given a few more screen minutes, and Marsden, a great actor who has yet to be really utilized properly in a big film, is relegated to nothing more than a grade-school bully with no real character. However, when the film is on, it's on like Pong. The ""guess who's coming to dinner"" scene with Ron at Linda's family's home is tear-inducing in its cringe-worthy hilarity. The RV slo-mo sequence is particularly inspired, but stealing every scene with relative ease is Carell and particularly so when he's on-screen with Wiig. They just tear down the walls with awesomeness. And then there is the satirical edge the film is given with its ultra-jingoistic attitude that Ron and the team start up when they don't even really do the news, but just give opinions about how great America is; needless, pointless speculation during a high-speed car chase (which interrupts Veronica's potentially world-changing interview with Yassar Arafat), and lists of the prettiest 'ginas in the world. It's a great, and occasionally scathing attack on almost all of the modern 24-hour news channels, and it's what gives the film the kick it needs to save it from just being a moderately funny film.While ANCHORMAN 2 doesn't exactly soar to new heights of hilarity, it's edgy enough and silly enough to keep you in your seat for most of the film.4 out of 5 stars.",4,"""By the hymen of Olivia

Dudley,"[3, 6]","In these days of quick sequels to cash in on the success of an original film, waiting almost 10 years to do the follow up is pretty much unheard of. But that is what happened with the sequel to 2004 comedy cult classic ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"". The thing to keep in mind is that the first film wasn't what many would call a smash success box office wise even though it grossed approximately 90 million worldwide on a budget of only 26 million. The original film instead grew in stature until a sequel was finally all but inevitable. I personally found the first film to be extremely funny and one of the most quoteable movies of all time. Not all of my friends shared my enthusiasm for the film. In its own way it did prove to be quite an acquired taste. The style of humor wasn't for everybody which added to its mystique.The sequel had twice the budget and grossed almost twice as much worldwide but was perceived as kind of a lackluster release money wise which I do really disagree with.The sequel builds on the original film but doesn't just do a pointless retread of the plot and most especially the jokes from the first film. Whereas the first dealt with gender equality, the sequel deals with race relations as well as the birth of the 24 hour news channel. Everybody from the first film returns and are clearly having a blast. The humor is a continuation of the first so if you didn't like the original, you are going to probably hate the sequel. I found it to be just as hilarious as the first film was. Sure maybe it's a bit long at 2 hours, but the jokes always hit hard and furious as well as landing with comedic perfection.The blu-ray comes with 3(!) cuts of the film. You get the PG-13 theatrical cut, an unrated version that runs about 4 minutes longer with more off color language and finally an ""R rated super sized"" edition that runs about 20 minutes longer than the unrated version as well as featuring 763 new jokes. It's an alternate cut of the film with much more R rated humor. It's also just as funny! Tons of deleted scenes along with an extensive gag reel and the such round out one of the most loaded blu ray releases of all time. You also get the PG-13 on a regular DVD too.

1545772,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B0083XXVFW,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[0, 3]","First of all, if you haven't seen the first film, what the heck are you doing here? Although you can watch and enjoy this film as is, there are a heaping helping of inside jokes referencing the first film that you'll be lost on. If you're a newbie to Ron Burgundy, go check out out the first film and see why it's a classic before dipping your toes into this one.Second of all, if you didn't like the first film, what the heck are you doing here? Do you think they might have tinkered with the formula a bit and made it more to your liking? The first film was a box office smash, so they'd have to be three fries shy of a value meal to go messing with what worked. I've already seen one review where the person wrote that they &#34;didn't care for&#34; Steve Carrell or Will Ferrel or the first film but still thought they'd give this one a try. Surprise, surprise: they gave it one star. C'mon, folks. You judge a movie on its goals and whether it meets them. You can't go around giving bumper cars an F just because you were looking for a &#34;smoother ride.&#34;If you've seen the first film and liked it, here's what I have to say: you'll almost certainly like this one.If you're in the first two categories of people and are sticking around just because you want to know what the big deal is, here's my two cents: the first two films are what I would call timeless comedy because they rely on pretty timeless elements. Unfortunately, these are also elements that appeal to all denominators, and so they aren't looked at as very high brow. We're talking the various shades of human stupidity. People getting hurt. Animal humor. Non sequiturs. Funny faces, voices, and over-the-top responses. There's not a lot in these films to tickle the intellect, in other words.But, really, if you look back over the ages, comedies age far more poorly than other films, and that's because so many comedies try to capitalize on current cultural trends, mores, or ideals, and so their impact is lost as those historical touchstones stop becoming relevant. But stupidity, pratfalls, puns and goofy bravado are timeless comedic elements, and they've stood the test of time. For every long-lasting comedy out there that has an actual story or message (WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, for instance, or GROUNDHOG DAY), there are at least half a dozen that are about creating a paper-thin plot upon which a non-stop string of gags are hung (AIRPLANE!, BLAZING SADDLES, or DUCK SOUP). The Ron Burgundy movies fall squarely into the latter category, and they do it with unapologetic gusto and undeniable skill.I'm not even going to get into the plot because we all know that's not really important here. I will only say the following three things about the film:1. This film actually approaches an intelligent plot in its treatment of the creation of a 24-hour news network, using the satire of GNN (the Global News Network) to show how the over-saturation of news outlets created a competitive environment that watered down and neutered the basic purpose of news. The satire isn't especially sharp or on point or lasting, but it's there, and it's kind of impressive that they even bothered using a topic that could actually create talking points. So, kudos to them.2. Unfortunately, this film has about five acts. I'm not here to tell you that movies have to be a certain length, but dramas and thrillers can make longer films work because they snag so much emotional investment from the audience. Comedies rarely ask for audiences to be emotionally invested in the characters, and so longer movies with more complicated character arcs become problematic if they aren't just rip-roaringly funny every other second. The first Anchorman film was great because it was trim -- in fact, they cut so much fat from that movie that they had enough left over to make a completely different film; seriously, check it out. It's called &#34;Wake Up, Ron Burgundy.&#34; In this case, they left it all in, creating a plot that stalls quite a bit in the fourth act when Ron decides to move into a lighthouse and befriend a shark called Doby.Plotwise, this section makes sense, but it kills the pace of the film and doesn't have enough gags to keep it interesting. In fact, most of the humor it uses is of the painfully repetitive variety. There are a few parts of the film throughout that use this to no great effect, including Ron's inability to wrap his head around having a black boss (he repeats the word &#34;black&#34; a dozen times, echoing a similar scene in an Austin Powers film regarding a guy with a mole), and this type of humor is pretty much hit or miss depending on how forgiving you are. This late into the film, most viewers are likely to see the comedic treadmilling (most of it is about a handicap that Ron has sustained) as a painful stall.3. I love almost all of the actors I saw in this, and I was even delighted by a callback from the first film (regarding a massive war between news companies) that was a treasure trove of cameos. However, there were two performances that really took me out of the film. First, there's Kanye West. Granted, he's not in it much, but the man is clearly incapable of acting. To a much greater extent is Ron's son, Walter. I approached his performance in every way possible to give this kid the benefit of the doubt (maybe it was satire of satire, maybe it was an ironic commentary on Ron's own shallowness, etc.), but by the end of the film, I was convinced that he was basically just an awful actor. I hate to rag on a child, but I know there are probably thousands of other child actors out there vying for roles, and it really is baffling that this is the kid they ended up with. He deflates nearly every scene he's in.That's it. A couple of weak spots keep this from being the success of the original, but it still retains that shimmer and sheen and is no less the wear for its tarnished moments.",4,Tarnished Gold,1394668800,"03

But being dragged into a theater by my wife and fans of the original, I crossed my fingers that somehow maybe two people I am not fans of might surprise me and pull off a half decent comedy flick. Even tho hopes where low, as I couldn't stand the first movie, it looked like it was possible they might change my mind within the first 5 minutes when I got a small chuckle from a line Harrison Ford says. However, everything went down from there and I only managed another small chuckle or two during the rest of the entire movie.The comedy I guess only works for a selected audience... kind of like Napoleon Dynamite, where you either think it is hysterical, or the most boring dialog you have ever heard in your life. Through this movie, the laughs I got was only once from Will Ferrell himself, one out of Harrison Ford, and one from Paul Rudd. Pretty bad when you laugh more from the supporting cast than the star of the film.There was also a lot of stupid humor, which I just could not grasp as being funny. The awkward pause, silent looks, and saying the most ridiculous thing you can imagine is just not something I find amusing anymore, not since it has been done to death already.  In fact, most jokes during the screening I reckon I heard 7 people in total of the theater laugh at, not to mention I had seen the same scene done better in previous movies, starting as way back as Top Secret in the 1980's. So many jokes and cheap laughs seemed stolen  and lifted from other movies, and it just made the done-to-death plot of the whole thing drag on longer than it should have felt.Speaking of dragging on, there is a scene near the end of the movie where a whole bunch of cameo appearances flood the screen at once. Will Ferrel might well know quite a lot of big name actors, but he has put them in the dumbest scene and scenario imaginable.

Not my favorite Will Ferrell movie, but no one does awkward like Mr. Ferrell. Talking with people throughout the past decade and a half, I find you either love Will Ferrell or hate Will Ferrell. However you gotta admit: The Ron Burgundy character is an absolute classic and he is in great, offensive form here in the sequel.Unlike 90% of the reviewers on Amazon, I'm not here to give away the plot or all the jokes, etc. But honestly, I don't understand all the bitching on here, all the 1 and 2 star ratings. Think you could write the sequel any better? I'll bet these are the same reviewers who complained that 'Hangover 2' was too much like the original 'Hangover'. (It's called using a formula that works.) Then when 'Hangover III' went a different direction than the first two story line wise, you cried that it wasn't anything like the original and the first sequel. ?!!The only issue I had, the only thing that seemed 'off' to me was Steve Carell's character reprisal. However, the chemistry is great once he meets Kristin Wig and they're able to bounce the awkwardness off each other.I didn't buy a movie ticket to see 'Anchorman 2'. Wish I did: I could have used the great laughs. I waited to pay a dollar and some change at a Redbox. Watched it twice. And, when the price drops on the DVD here on Amazon, I'll pick up a copy to add to my shelf, place it right after the original 'Anchorman', next to my Will Ferrell faves: 'Old School', 'Semi-Pro' and 'Step Brothers'.You know, these are comedies. Quit taking them so seriously, like it's a Marvel movie. It's Ron Burgundy, not Iron Man.If you can't find the humor in this sequel, or in 'stupid comedies' like 'Haunted House', 'Kingpin, 'The Internship', 'Bad Santa', or 'Naked Gun 33 1/3' because nothing outside of the (great) Monty Python realm is 'deep enough' for you, get off your holier-than-thou high horse already.

After being informed by respected newscaster Mack Tannen (Played by Harrison Ford) that Veronica Corningstone (Christina Appellgate) will be the new lead anchor for WBC, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is fired from his job as an anchorman and jealously/selfishly walks out on his family.  After resurfacing six months later at San Diego, he is offered a spot at the upstart cable company GNN (Global News Network).  This inspires him to reunite the news team, so he recruits Champ Kind (David Koechner), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell) to once again dominate the news.  Once the team finds out they've been scheduled for a graveyard slot, they need to find a way to make it entertaining so they can remain in a business; largely as a result of Burgundy making a foolish bet with prime-time anchor Jack Lime (James Marsden).  Despite the terrible slot, the team manages to use sensationalism to boost their ratings.  Though this is good for the team, this further divides Ron and Veronica; who objects to the overall decline of Ron's reporting of real news, not to mention the decline of Ron's presence in the life of his son Walter (Judah Nelson).  Further, the team's credibility is further hampered behind the scenes once GNN impresario Kench Allenby (Josh Lawson) informs station manager Linda Jackson (Meagan Good) that they can use &#34;synergy&#34; to suppress one of Fantana's stories that would paint their corporate sponsors in a negative light.  Will Burgundy be as successful in cable news as he was in San Diego?  Will they be able to report the news over sensationalist fluff pieces?  Will Ron be a better dad to Walter?I didn't mind the commentary on the devolving state of corporate-backed media, even if too many of the pot-shots were directed at Rupert Murdoch as opposed to media as a whole (and trust me, I'm the last guy on the planet who'd be a Fox News apologist.)  Yet at the same time, this film was marketed as a comedy.  Honestly, I think I may have laughed once or twice during the entire film (one of those instances was during Jim Carrey's brief cameo toward the end.)  The rest of the humor was either absent, too absurd to be funny, or was a joke best suited for 2004.  I understand not all sequels will hit it out of the park, but this was probably one of those which waited too long between releases to captivate both the audience and actors playing the roles for it to be considered worthwhile.Recommended for fans of the franchise only.  Others would be better off seeing the original Anchorman.",2,"Didn't Mind The Commentary On The State Of Mainstream Media, But Expected At Least SOME Humor In A Comedy Film",1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,2604,"['Synopsis', 'time', 'set', 'early', '1980s', 'being', 'informed', 'respected', 'newscaster', 'Mack', 'Tannen', 'Played', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Appellgate', 'will', 'be', 'new', 'lead', 'anchor', 'WBC', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'fired', 'job', 'anchorman', 'jealously/selfishly', 'walks', 'out', 'family', 'resurfacing', 'six', 'months', 'later', 'San', 'Diego', 'offered', 'spot', 'upstart', 'cable', 'company', 'GNN', 'Global', 'News', 'Network', 'reunite', 'news', 'team', 'Champ', 'Kind', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Brian', 'Fantana', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'once', 'again', 'dominate', 'news', 'team', 'out', ""'ve"", 'been', 'scheduled', 'graveyard', 'slot', 'need', 'find', 'way', 'make', 'entertaining', 'can', 'remain', 'business', 'largely', 'result', 'Burgundy', 'making', 'foolish', 'bet', 'prime-time', 'anchor', 'Jack', 'Lime', 'James', 'Marsden', 'terrible', 'slot', 'team', 'use', 'sensationalism', 'boost', 'ratings', 'good', 'team', 'further', 'divides', 'Ron', 'Veronica', 'who', 'overall', 'decline', 'Ron', 'reporting', 'real', 'news', 'not', 'mention', 'decline', 'Ron', 'presence', 'life', 'son', 'Walter', 'Judah', 'Nelson', 'Further', 'team', 'credibility', 'further', 'hampered', 'scenes', 'once', 'GNN', 'impresario', 'Kench', 'Allenby', 'Josh', 'Lawson', 'station', 'manager', 'Linda', 'Jackson', 'Meagan', 'Good', 'can', 'use', '34', 'synergy', '34', 'suppress', 'one', 'Fantana', 'stories', 'would', 'paint', 'corporate', 'sponsors', 'negative', 'light', 'Will', 'Burgundy', 'be', 'as', 'successful', 'cable', 'news', 'was', 'San', 'Diego', 'Will', 'be', 'able', 'report', 'news', 'sensationalist', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'Will', 'Ron', 'be', 'better', 'dad', 'Walter', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'commentary', 'devolving', 'state', 'corporate-backed', 'media', 'even', 'too', 'many', 'pot-shots', 'were', 'directed', 'Rupert', 'Murdoch', 'opposed', 'media', 'whole', 'trust', ""'m"", 'last', 'guy', 'planet', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'Fox', 'News', 'apologist', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'marketed', 'comedy', 'Honestly', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'laughed', 'once', 'twice', 'entire', 'film', 'one', 'instances', 'was', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'brief', 'end', 'rest', 'humor', 'was', 'absent', 'too', 'absurd', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'joke', 'best', 'suited', '2004', 'understand', 'not', 'sequels', 'will', 'hit', 'park', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'waited', 'too', 'long', 'releases', 'captivate', 'audience', 'actors', 'playing', 'roles', 'be', 'considered', 'worthwhile.Recommended', 'fans', 'franchise', 'only', 'Others', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'seeing', 'original', 'Anchorman']",N/A

The ""Legend"" of course refers to Ron Burgundy, the pompous, politically incorrect buffoon of a newscaster from San Diego (or Diago as he pronounces it).  Replete in his burgundy suit, Ron has married his one-time nemesis, Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate).  They are now co-anchors in New York doing a non-prime time newscast.  When the prime-time anchor position opens up, Veronica is promoted and Ron is fired.Disconsolate, Ron leaves his wife when she has to make a choice of the job or him.  He is then approached by Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker), a producer for a new 24 hour news network.  That idea alone is worth about 15 minutes of hilarity.  The network wants Ron and his former crew to handle the 2 AM to 6 AM news slot.  Ron accepts but must go on a road trip to round up his co-workers from their time in San Diego.  They include investigative reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and sports reporter Champ Kind (David Koechner).Once they arrive, the guys are heckled by rising star, Jack Lime (James Marsden) until Lime loses a bet to Ron and has to change his name to ""Lame.""  Megan Good plays Ron's no-BS boss, Linda.  After Ron spends most of his first newscast commenting on a car chase being filmed by a local news chopper, Ron changes the landscape for news.  Instead of telling the viewers what they need to know, he tells them what they want to know.  It's a ratings bonanza and Linda begins to saddle up to Ron, even inviting him to a large family dinner.  I found myself wincing and laughing hysterically all at the same time.  Such is the whole film.Obviously there is much improv going on in the movie helmed by Adam McKay and for the most part it all seemed very natural and very funny.  But the movie is not the non-stop laughter I remember with the original.

The first Anchorman was funny, uniquely charming (in a politically incorrect way) and was one of those rare comedies that one appreciated more and more with repeat viewings (I think the correct way of describing such a movie in the industry is that it had ""legs"").Unfortunately the humour in Anchorman 2 seemed a little forced and quite a few of the jokes fell flat.

1545807,A39W3263A9HCMN,B0083XXVFW,"Renfield ""Up the Irons""","[0, 0]","I find the abundance of negative reviews interesting because despite my rather messy memory,  I remember when the first Anchorman film came out. And I can promise you, that film had a similar amount of negative press from users. Yet over the years, with the emergence of social networks and in the school hallways, I'd find words like ""Great Odin's raven!"" Or ""Invitation to the pants party"" thrown around like de-icing salt. And I'm pretty sure that this film will have a similar thing going for it. Mind you, I loved the first movie upon first viewing. It had juvenile humour, star power, and easily the best thing about it was that in every scene, the actors were clearly trying not to laugh (pay special attention to Christina Applegate- she's the worst for this in both movies. You can tell when it's getting too much for her because it cuts immediately so she can dissolve into uncontrollable laughter). It was great back then, and it was still great on my most recent viewing.Of course, I'm not in any way trying to imply that this film is as good as first. For one, it does have a ton of pacing issues- two hours is too long for a comedy like this. The film does tend to get repetitive in places (though not like the first didn't). Yet, much like the earlier released ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"", low expectations was what lessened the blow of that. And of course, the jokes are a bit too out there at times, but really, this is an absurdist comedy. And what it does good, it does very good. There's still tons of really vulgar and puerile jokes, but come on, just remember what kind of film you're watching. That said, what this film really did best was its much deserving dig at those 24 hours ""news"" networks. I swear, I expect that happened in this movie to happen on those kinds of s***ty networks. And of course, like I mentioned above- the star power. It's so great to see the guys having fun again, and struggling once more to keep it in the face. Every single actor has a hard time keeping a straight face in every scene, which is just what makes it funnier. And of course, the completely vulgar jokes work too. Like the scene where they smoke crack on air. Brilliant! The abundance of celebrity cameos adds to the film's absurd and surreal feel, and all are very satisfying and fun to watch.Point is, as flawed and overlong as the movie is, it's still fun to watch. It is by no means perfect, and the film itself even is aware of it at times. But lower your expectations and you'll have a last. A common complaint I've seen in much of these reviews is that they were ""huge fans if the first film"" and they're digging their own graves by having such high expectations.  For me, the magic was still there, and it still is. And while I'm not sure I'd want an Anchorman 3, this film still entertains greatly.

I'm a huge fan of the original. I had that film memorized LONG before the sequel came out. I know that the idea of a worthy sequel sounds ridiculous. I know the idea of a COMEDY sequel that is better than the original Anchorman is just incomprehensible, but as a true fan, I have to say: This is one of those things that you just have to take on Faith.The film begins with a hilarious cameo from Drake fallowed by a great cameo from Harrison Ford. And the film's final battle features cameo appearances by Ford, Sacha Baron Cohen, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Kanye West, Will Smith, Jim Carrey, Liam Neeson, The Ghost of Stonewall Jackson(played by a as funny as ever John C. Reilly), and concludes things with an unforgettable cameo from a very familiar face. This cameo will have any true Anchorman fan jump out of their seat and cheer.This movie blew me away in two ways in particular. 1- It was so much funnier than the timeless classic that was the original. and 2. The thing that separated this film from every comedy sequel before it was a very few references there were to the first film.

The first Anchorman was a fun movie that was absurd and brilliant in the way it sent up gender stereotypes in the 1970's. There is some attempt to do something similar here, but it never seems like more than a random plot point or a chance to riff on a particular subject rather than being integral to the movie. The humor is almost dada-esque in its absurdity, but a lot of the jokes fell flat to me because they simply didn't have a punchline. Just pointing out how ridiculous you are doesn't count. The story was also very episodic, feeling like a bunch of sketches strung together. Sure, the first one was kind of like that, but it was also 30 minutes shorter. Still, there are a number of great lines and a couple of scenes which I laughed really hard at. One was a dinner with Ron and his new girlfriend's family, and the other was a news team melee that more than tops the brawl in the first film. It's also loaded with cameos. There was also a bunch of humor derived from what the 24-hour news cycle has done to broadcast news. Essentially, the movie has Ron Burgundy come up with Fox News' modus operandi off the top of his head. Those bits were pretty funny, although they never really commit to the idea. In fact, that's probably the biggest issue I have with the film, is that it doesn't really shoot for anything other than bigger jokes and more outlandish comedic set-pieces. Sequels are typically bigger than their predecessors, but this one just has a bloated run time when it could have gone with a full-on satire. Still, it was nice to see Ron and company back together again. Brick even gets a love interest(?) who's just as weird as he is, although that's one of the random things I would have trimmed. A lot of scenes between him and Kristen Wiig are just flat-out unfunny and go nowhere. I'd recommend this to fans of the original, but it would be hard for me to do the same for those uninitiated. They'd probably be better off checking out the original, which is far better than this one.",3,"My review of ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues""",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,2093,"['2', 'have', 'moments', 'largely', 'disappointing', 'too', 'long', 'first', 'Anchorman', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', 'was', 'absurd', 'brilliant', 'way', 'sent', 'up', 'gender', 'stereotypes', '1970', 'attempt', 'do', 'something', 'similar', 'here', 'never', 'more', 'random', 'plot', 'point', 'chance', 'riff', 'particular', 'subject', 'rather', 'being', 'integral', 'movie', 'humor', 'almost', 'dada-esque', 'absurdity', 'lot', 'jokes', 'fell', 'flat', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'punchline', 'Just', 'pointing', 'out', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'are', ""n't"", 'count', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'episodic', 'feeling', 'bunch', 'sketches', 'strung', 'together', 'Sure', 'first', 'one', 'was', 'kind', 'was', 'also', '30', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'Still', 'are', 'number', 'great', 'lines', 'couple', 'scenes', 'laughed', 'really', 'hard', 'One', 'was', 'dinner', 'Ron', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'family', 'other', 'was', 'news', 'team', 'melee', 'more', 'tops', 'brawl', 'first', 'film', 'also', 'loaded', 'cameos', 'was', 'also', 'bunch', 'humor', 'derived', 'what', '24-hour', 'news', 'cycle', 'done', 'broadcast', 'news', 'Essentially', 'movie', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'come', 'up', 'Fox', 'News', 'modus', 'operandi', 'off', 'top', 'head', 'bits', 'were', 'pretty', 'funny', 'never', 'really', 'commit', 'idea', 'fact', 'probably', 'biggest', 'issue', 'have', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'shoot', 'anything', 'other', 'bigger', 'jokes', 'more', 'outlandish', 'comedic', 'set-pieces', 'Sequels', 'are', 'typically', 'bigger', 'predecessors', 'one', 'just', 'bloated', 'run', 'time', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'full-on', 'satire', 'Still', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'Ron', 'company', 'back', 'together', 'again', 'Brick', 'even', 'love', 'interest', 'who', 'just', 'as', 'weird', 'one', 'random', 'things', 'would', 'have', 'trimmed', 'lot', 'scenes', 'Kristen', 'Wiig', 'are', 'just', 'flat-out', 'unfunny', 'go', 'nowhere', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'fans', 'original', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'same', 'uninitiated', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'off', 'checking', 'out', 'original', 'far', 'better', 'one']",N/A

That would be pretty inconsiderate.I don't think there is any single moment in this movie that people will completely lose it over but for two hours the movie quietly pounds away in absurdity.  I watched this in a fairly full theatre of college kids and there was a consistent level of positive reaction.  About 80% of the attempted humor got a laugh and that's not a bad based on recent experience.Part of the joy of this movie is that it has so many threads of story to appeal to so many.  The older set will enjoy the wonderfully archaic fashion (it made me want to find some of those delightful polyester pattern shirts) and numerous period references, though some of these seem anachronistic given the movie is set in 1980.At times the film echos Zoolander as macho professional archetypes square off in hopelessly absurd duels for dominance of the stage.  The film's closing melee is star-studded and from a story perspective, somewhat of a letdown, but I was too busy trying to figure out all the cameos to realize that until much later.  My primary observation from that scene is to note that a lot of famous people are starting to look really old.  Yow.Lastly, the thing that really sticks out for me about this movie is that like all comedies, it goes through that mandatory dramatic shift about 2/3 of the way through but Anchorman 2 somehow survives and continues to be funny.  Perhaps that's because the movie's poignant moments aren't all that poignant but nevertheless, the movie manages to deliver laughs even after the usual serious interludes.Oh, and if you do happen to sit through the movie's massive credits, there is a brief additional scene.

That's what I thought &#34;Anchorman 2&#34; was going to end up doing, seeing how the film had commercials on every channel and utilized every marketing strategy imaginable for months.  When &#34;Anchorman 2&#34; was getting ready to come out in theaters it was impossible to go online or watch TV without seeing Ron Burgundy in some shape or form.  Whether it was his guest spot in commercials (such as Dodge) or guest hosting news and sports stations, it felt like if the constant over-exposure of Ron Burgundy was done as an attempt to draw in viewers because the film was incapable of doing so on its own merits.  Well, that case proved to be true.&#34;Anchorman 2&#34; is a boring, lackluster, and not-so-funny film.  Whereas the original wasn't necessarily the funniest movie in the world, it did still have its own charm and was capable of providing laughs.  With the sequel, it feels like if the writer, the director, and all of the actors were just trying too hard to be funny and instead of succeeding, it felt like they were grasping for straws and attempting anything they could imagine to make the film &#34;funny&#34;.....and they failed.The plot is completely forgettable and in fact trying to follow it will bore the average viewer.  The jokes are done with over-the-top levels of immaturity, and as a result it creates a cheap and simplistic film that feels like its main target audience is prepubescent boys who still laugh at their own farts.  Will Ferrel can already be hard to bare for most people, seeing how his style of comedy is usually forced and overdone, however, there are many films and instances where he is enjoyable in small enough doses.  This film isn't one of those instances.Everything about &#34;Anchorman 2&#34; screams of mediocrity, at best, the storyline and jokes feel forced and rushed, as if they made this film just to say that they made a sequel but the writers didn't even bother to make sure it made sense.

When I sat down in the theater for the long-awaited sequel, I expected more humor along the same lines (if not quite as fresh).  That is exactly what I received...and in the case of comedy films that is a win for all parties involved.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Anchorman 2&#34; tells the story once again of Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), a man born to look good and read the news.  When wife Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) essentially takes his job, however, Ron must decide what the next direction is that his life should take.  With input from the old news team of Brick Tamland (Steve Carrell), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Champ Kind (David Koechner), Ron decides to pursue an opportunity to land on a 24-hour news station.This sequel primarily works because of Ferrell's impeccably honed Burgundy character.  When some of the jokes inevitably fall flat, sometimes just Ferrell's reactions alone can carry a scene.  Without his strong presence, this franchise (and especially this installment) would be utterly lost.  Does the movie contain an ensemble cast?  To be sure.  All the auxiliary parts work well together...but they also have some jokes that fall completely flat or are just plain stupid.  Only the &#34;Burgundy scenes&#34; are the ones that are consistently hilarious.Basically, &#34;Anchorman 2&#34; is a four-star movie (though not five) because it continues the solid humor of the original.  It contains more than its share of fresh jokes, but others are just a bit stale because they have essentially been done before.  That's not fault of its own, of course, but the characters were just so fresh in the original that now they don't &#34;pop&#34; quite as much here.  Essentially, this is probably about the best sequel that could have been expected for this franchise.",4,About What I Expected (And In This Case That's A Good Thing),1387843200,"12 24, 2013",2013,1901,"['first', '34', 'Anchorman', '34', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'quotable', 'comedy', 'movies', 'all-time', 'When', 'sat', 'down', 'theater', 'long-awaited', 'sequel', 'expected', 'more', 'humor', 'same', 'lines', 'not', 'quite', 'fresh', 'exactly', 'what', 'received', 'case', 'comedy', 'films', 'win', 'parties', 'involved.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', '34', 'Anchorman', '2', '34', 'story', 'once', 'again', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'man', 'born', 'look', 'good', 'read', 'news', 'When', 'wife', 'Veronica', 'Corningstone', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'essentially', 'job', 'however', 'Ron', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'next', 'direction', 'life', 'should', 'take', 'input', 'old', 'news', 'team', 'Brick', 'Tamland', 'Steve', 'Carrell', 'Brian', 'Fantana', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Champ', 'Kind', 'David', 'Koechner', 'Ron', 'pursue', 'opportunity', 'land', '24-hour', 'news', 'station.This', 'sequel', 'primarily', 'Ferrell', 'impeccably', 'honed', 'Burgundy', 'character', 'When', 'jokes', 'inevitably', 'fall', 'flat', 'sometimes', 'just', 'Ferrell', 'reactions', 'alone', 'can', 'carry', 'scene', 'strong', 'presence', 'franchise', 'especially', 'installment', 'would', 'be', 'utterly', 'lost', 'movie', 'contain', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'be', 'sure', 'auxiliary', 'parts', 'work', 'well', 'together', 'also', 'have', 'jokes', 'fall', 'completely', 'flat', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'stupid', 'Only', '34', 'Burgundy', '34', 'are', 'ones', 'are', 'consistently', 'hilarious.Basically', '34', 'Anchorman', '2', '34', 'four-star', 'movie', 'not', 'five', 'solid', 'humor', 'original', 'more', 'share', 'fresh', 'jokes', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'bit', 'stale', 'have', 'essentially', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'not', 'fault', 'own', 'course', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'fresh', 'original', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", '34', 'pop', '34', 'quite', 'much', 'here', 'Essentially', 'probably', 'best', 'sequel', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expected', 'franchise']",N/A
