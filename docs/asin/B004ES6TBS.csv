I want to be mad that it's been so long between the release of season 3 and season 4 but this is better now than never!Not everyone who reads these reviews is a fan so I will attempt to review the product for people maybe considering purchasing Coach seasons.  This show excels because of the writing, the entertaining way the episodes present themselves & the genuinely-funny material being delivered by the top-notch actors (main roles & recurring characters alike).  If you haven't discovered Coach yet, then I highly recommend it not only if you are a sports fan (which I am not at all), but simply at its core, it's a truly laugh-out-loud hilarious television series which deserves it's place certainly in the category of greatest sitcoms in the last quarter of the century.Coach Hayden Fox FOREVER!",5,'Bout time!,1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,967,"['took', 'long', 'enough', 'Universal', 'finally', 'got', 'hint', 'not', 'releasing', 'seasons', 'Coach', 'would', 'be', 'foolish', 'seeing', 'how', 'show', 'quite', 'following', 'want', 'be', 'mad', 'been', 'so', 'long', 'release', 'season', '3', 'season', '4', 'better', 'now', 'never', 'Not', 'everyone', 'who', 'reviews', 'fan', 'will', 'attempt', 'review', 'product', 'people', 'maybe', 'considering', 'purchasing', 'Coach', 'seasons', 'show', 'writing', 'entertaining', 'way', 'episodes', 'present', 'genuinely-funny', 'material', 'being', 'delivered', 'top-notch', 'actors', 'main', 'roles', 'recurring', 'characters', 'alike', 'have', ""n't"", 'discovered', 'Coach', 'yet', 'then', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'sports', 'fan', 'am', 'not', 'simply', 'core', 'truly', 'laugh-out-loud', 'hilarious', 'television', 'series', 'place', 'certainly', 'category', 'greatest', 'sitcoms', 'last', 'quarter', 'century.Coach', 'Hayden', 'Fox', 'FOREVER']",Coach: The Fourth Season

1404623,A1P2DHHCZ3K6JP,B004ES6TBS,O. B. Tryggvason,"[0, 1]","Having already established a winning formula this season of ""Coach"" nevertheless falters somewhat.The first two seasons were good and the third was outstanding.""Coach"" has never been afraid of downsizing the comedic aspects in favour of some drama and last season's breakup between Hayden and Christine balanced well the show's quality humor with outstanding dramatic outbursts that packed a punch. Thanks to the strong cast the show can easily pull this off and the solid writing combined with quality slapstick provided by Jerry Van Dyke and Bill Fagerbakke; ""Coach"" really had found a winning formula. But it feels like here everyone involved got a little too lazy. Too many episodes go far and away overboard with silly humor (ep. 6; ""I think I Can't, I Think I can't"", ep. 8 ""Loonstruck"", ep. 11 ""Rizzendough Revisited"" and ep. 13 ""War of the Dopes"") that undermines the show's quality. In particular ""War of the Dopes"" displays Luther in a particularly bad fashion; he's always been very eccentric and a little childlike but here he's just a plain nutcase. In fact; compare that with ep 16 (""Last of the Red-Hot Luthers"") and you'll see what a likable yet simple guy Luther really is and how well Van Dyke plays him. That's also one of the best Season 4 episode.Everything concerning Kelly is a little annoying as well. She's never really fit properly in the show. Claire Carey is not as good a performer as Nelson or Fabares but, in all fairness, she doesn't get all that much to do except complain, be loud and frustrated. Just when Kris Kamm (as Kelly's husband Stuart) was growing into his role (and getting better at it) he exits the show and along comes another crisis-era for Kelly - and again Hayden finds it difficult to relate to his daughter who continually seeks comfort with Christine - again - which annoys her dad - again. A similar scenario was already covered in Season 2 and here it just gets tiresome.As for Hayden and Christine - now that they've grown comfortable in their relationship the strain put upon them here is that Christine can further her career quite a bit...only it's in New York. This sets up the dramatic finale in Season 4 but it's far less emotional than their breakup in the previous season. In fact; Hayden comes off as quite the petulant child who reveals nasty sides to his personality during this ordeal. As always; Hayden sees the light of day in the end but his journey there isn't as funny as before.Bright spots, however, are to be found here. ""A Real Guy's Guy"" is hilarious from start to finish and Nelson gets to showcase Coach Fox's inability to see beyond male stereotypes when he discovers that his top Screaming Eagles guy is gay. It's always funny to see how Hayden acts without thinking as he does when he buys a bigger cabin in ""Any place I Hang Myself is Home"" and Christine gradually makes him see the errors of his ways. The running storyline of the Screaming Eagles's path to the Pineapple Bowl and Hayden's confrontation with an idol coach of his is very good. A particular season 4 highpoint is ""The Last of the Red-Hot Luthers"", where Luther spends a night of passion with Coach's secreatary Ms. Thorkelson. Standout acting by Van Dyke, Pat Crawford Brown (as Ms. Thorkelson) and Nelson; this ep showcases ""Coach"" at it's best; big laughs and well written drama.""Coach"" is one of my favortie sitcoms. Although Season 4 disappoints somewhat it's still entertaining. Can't wait for future releases; just hope Season 5 doesn't take three years to arrive.",3,Good but not great season of Coach,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,3521,"['Having', 'already', 'established', 'winning', 'formula', 'season', 'Coach', 'nevertheless', 'falters', 'somewhat.The', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'were', 'good', 'third', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Coach', 'never', 'been', 'afraid', 'downsizing', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'favour', 'drama', 'last', 'season', 'breakup', 'Hayden', 'Christine', 'balanced', 'well', 'show', 'quality', 'humor', 'outstanding', 'dramatic', 'outbursts', 'packed', 'punch', 'Thanks', 'strong', 'cast', 'show', 'can', 'easily', 'pull', 'off', 'solid', 'writing', 'combined', 'quality', 'slapstick', 'provided', 'Jerry', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Bill', 'Fagerbakke', 'Coach', 'really', 'had', 'found', 'winning', 'formula', 'here', 'everyone', 'involved', 'got', 'little', 'too', 'lazy', 'Too', 'many', 'episodes', 'go', 'far', 'away', 'overboard', 'silly', 'humor', 'ep', '6', 'think', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Think', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ep', '8', 'Loonstruck', 'ep', '11', 'Rizzendough', 'Revisited', 'ep', '13', 'War', 'Dopes', 'show', 'quality', 'particular', 'War', 'Dopes', 'Luther', 'particularly', 'bad', 'fashion', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'eccentric', 'little', 'childlike', 'here', 'just', 'plain', 'nutcase', 'fact', 'compare', 'ep', '16', 'Last', 'Red-Hot', 'Luthers', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'likable', 'yet', 'simple', 'guy', 'Luther', 'really', 'how', 'well', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'Season', '4', 'episode.Everything', 'concerning', 'Kelly', 'little', 'annoying', 'as', 'well', 'never', 'really', 'fit', 'properly', 'show', 'Claire', 'Carey', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'performer', 'Nelson', 'Fabares', 'fairness', ""n't"", 'get', 'much', 'do', 'complain', 'be', 'loud', 'frustrated', 'Just', 'when', 'Kris', 'Kamm', 'Kelly', 'husband', 'Stuart', 'was', 'growing', 'role', 'getting', 'better', 'show', 'along', 'crisis-era', 'Kelly', 'again', 'Hayden', 'difficult', 'relate', 'daughter', 'who', 'continually', 'comfort', 'Christine', 'again', 'dad', 'again', 'similar', 'scenario', 'was', 'already', 'covered', 'Season', '2', 'here', 'just', 'tiresome.As', 'Hayden', 'Christine', 'now', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'comfortable', 'relationship', 'strain', 'put', 'here', 'Christine', 'can', 'further', 'career', 'quite', 'bit', 'only', 'New', 'York', 'up', 'dramatic', 'finale', 'Season', '4', 'far', 'less', 'emotional', 'breakup', 'previous', 'season', 'fact', 'Hayden', 'off', 'quite', 'petulant', 'child', 'who', 'nasty', 'sides', 'personality', 'ordeal', 'always', 'Hayden', 'light', 'day', 'end', 'journey', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'before.Bright', 'spots', 'however', 'are', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Real', 'Guy', 'Guy', 'hilarious', 'start', 'finish', 'Nelson', 'showcase', 'Coach', 'Fox', 'inability', 'see', 'male', 'stereotypes', 'when', 'top', 'Screaming', 'Eagles', 'guy', 'gay', 'always', 'funny', 'see', 'how', 'Hayden', 'acts', 'thinking', 'when', 'bigger', 'cabin', 'Any', 'place', 'Hang', 'Myself', 'Home', 'Christine', 'gradually', 'see', 'errors', 'ways', 'running', 'storyline', 'Screaming', 'Eagles', 'path', 'Pineapple', 'Bowl', 'Hayden', 'confrontation', 'idol', 'coach', 'very', 'good', 'particular', 'season', '4', 'highpoint', 'Last', 'Red-Hot', 'Luthers', 'where', 'Luther', 'night', 'passion', 'Coach', 'secreatary', 'Ms.', 'Thorkelson', 'acting', 'Van', 'Dyke', 'Pat', 'Crawford', 'Brown', 'Ms.', 'Thorkelson', 'Nelson', 'ep', 'Coach', 'best', 'big', 'laughs', 'well', 'written', 'drama', 'Coach', 'one', 'favortie', 'sitcoms', 'Season', '4', 'disappoints', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'future', 'releases', 'just', 'hope', 'Season', '5', ""n't"", 'take', 'three', 'years', 'arrive']",Coach: The Fourth Season
