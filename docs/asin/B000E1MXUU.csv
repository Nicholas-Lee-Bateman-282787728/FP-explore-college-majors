Hustwick,"[0, 0]","First of all, let&#8217;s get out of the way what &#8220;Swordfish&#8221; is not: this is neither a &#8220;hacking&#8221; movie nor a &#8220;grittier&#8221; contemporary version of &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; (even if Domenic Sena ripped off the poster concept and the slow-motion acrobatic violence). It&#8217;s not a mind-bending thriller and its big twists are both implausible and overshoot the mark.  No, what Swordfish is is a loud, blustering, Tony Scott knockoff &#8212; one of a new crop of films to emerge around the turn of the millenium &#8212; a postmodern 1980s action movie &#8212; $102,000,000 worth of pyrotechnics, trashy dialogue, ultra-violence&#8230; and a script that portended a horriffic Hollywood career for Skip Woods in the years to come.The plot involves a mish-mash of Die Hard theft and vigilante politics, with Travolta as the villain, Jackman as the hero, and Berry as the femme fatale.  None are very believable &#8212; but each seems to be having enough fun.  Travolta dials in &#8220;crazy&#8221; and comes closest to finding his character when squeezing off rounds from a large caliber machine gun in the streets of downtown Los Angeles.  Jackman has the most fun with the film &#8212; and even though his turn as one of the world&#8217;s greatest computer hackers is goofy at best (try listening to him describe how he does what he does), you just can&#8217;t help but enjoy the guy.To call the film&#8217;s pre-9/11morals &#8220;ambiguous&#8221; is to give the filmmakers too much credit.  The entire conceit was so obviously caluculated by Silver & Co. to cash in on the zeitgeist of the ealry 2000s, to splice Tarantino riffs with Besson gunplay, measured &#8220;quirkiness&#8221; with amber-filtered postmodernism &#8212; this giant piece of disposable entertainment is a guilty pleasure amd a throwback to the excesses of yesteryear.

965820,A168KINQ59CZOZ,B000E1MXUU,Josh B.,"[0, 0]","Swordfish has in my opinion one of the best openings to a movie I have ever seen. The writing here is so superb, I think it should have been worthy of an Oscar nomination for John Travolta just for this scene alone. It introduces the character of Gabriel played by Travolta. At first you don't really know what is going on just that Gabriel is here starting to talk about Hollywood movies. As the dialogue progresses you begin to hear Gabriel discussing his distaste for movies lack of realism. He then moves into discussing the movie Dog Day Afternoon. And what would happen if Pacino really wanted to get away with the money he stole from the bank in the movie. Gabriel talks about what if Pacino started killing hostages left and right. How long would it take for the city to reverse is policies on hostage negotiation. It is then revealed that Gabriel has taken hostages and is in the middle of a bank heist of his own. Not to give too much more away for people who haven't seen Swordfish but the beginning ends with an amazing explosion that will rock your home theater system into overdrive along with some amazing visual photography.The character of Gabriel is my favorite Travolta performance of all-time. He plays a character who is always many steps ahead of everyone else in the entire movie. Until the ending you never really know who Gabriel really is, only that he is a bad guy. And he's a bad guy you really like. You are always left guessing at what the motive is behind all of his actions, but he goes on to talk much about misdirection. Throughout the entire movie this is always a reoccurring theme to keep you guessing at what happens next.The rest of the cast is absolutely perfect. Hugh Jackman plays the part of Stanley Jobson who is an computer hacker who no longer is allowed anywhere near a computer and is living in a trailer working a dead-end job. Halle Berry plays the roll of Ginger, who like Gabriel, as the movie goes on you never are too sure of who she really is. All that you are lead to know is that she is with Gabriel and her job is to bring Stanley in because Gabriel wants his computer skills for a job he needs done. Don Cheadle plays the rob of J.T. Roberts who worked for the FBI and was the man who arrested Stanley and is the reason he is no longer allowed near a computer. Also following Stanley's arrest, Stanley lost custody of his daughter thanks to Roberts. Roberts now is now on the trail of Gabriel and the one trying to put together what Gabriel needs Stanley to do for him. Lastly, Sam Shepard plays the roll of Senator Reisman. I won't go too deep into what his roll is in the movie as it might give too much away to those who haven't seen it. Just know he plays a very important roll.I will say that action movies are by far my favorite type of movie and this movie is a perfect example of why. This movie features everything you will look for in an action movie; guns, car chases (with a beatuiful TVR Tuscan I might add), explosions, beautiful women, and even a bus dangling from a helicopter while flying through L.A. The movie also has a visual look to it that I can't put quite into words. It has some type of yellowish lens filter on some scenes and a cool blueish, purplish, greenish filter on other scenes. You really have to see it, it just gives the movie its own feeling that I have never seen before and I absolutely love it. And I never want another movie to use it because looking at it just reminds me this is Swordfish.The other thing I must bring up is this films AMAZING soundtrackSwordfish. It was created by popular techno artist Paul Oakenfold. I have never heard a soundtrack like this in my life. It just fits the entire look of the movie so amazingly and will also give your home theater system a workout as well.Finally I will talk about the Blu-Ray itself. The picture quality here is reference quality. Its that good. Everything is just crystal clear with no grain and beautifully formatted. It also features a 5.1 Dolby Digital track which is a bit older than today's current DTS HD tracks but it still sounds very phenomenal.Just sit back and log on, hack in, go anywhere, and steal everyting with Swordfish.",5,"Misdirection.

There were moments here that I really enjoyed, but they always seemed offset by some form of silliness that ratcheted everything else down a notch, like the hacking/bj scene. There's also zero sense of reality (the DOD mainframe gets hacked and they don't immediately track the ISP?), but I doubt that was the goal here.The ending is laughable; watch the two deleted endings in the extras and listen to the director's commentary.

The opening 360 degree angle on the exploding hostage is as disturbing as this kind of scene can get.2.  Travolta and Jackman's wild ride through the streets of LA has unusual twists and explosive action.3.  The flying bus at the climax is original and nervewracking, and the movie's set piece.Actually, even though John Travolta's turn as Gabriel Sear, is another scenery-chomping bit of excellence, the movie really belongs to Hugh Jackman.  Jackman, a Tony winner for the life of Peter Allen, proves his versatility in this heroic role.  Rumors of his being considered for the New James Bond should blossom, as I feel Jackman would make a great 007.Of all the movies I've seen the talented Halle Berry, this is one of her least effective performances.  Boobs aside, Berry doesn't really do anything but add sexual tension.  Considering her emotional speech when she won her Oscar about bringing non-Caucasian females their first best actress, you'd think she'd stop making movies like this and DIE ANOTHER DAY, where her physical attributes are more important than her acting ability.

I didn't know anything about the movie except that it starred John Travolta and Halle Berry.I was quite surprised at how entertaining and engaging SWORDFISH was. The beginning of the movie confused me because I didn't know what was going on, but as the film progressed by going back in time, I was made to understand. Things were made clear and pieces fit together.After the confusing, yet highly intriguing opening five minutes of the film, the movie slows down considerably and doesn't pick up again for about forty minutes. I don't know why that is but in action flicks, character development usually doesn't keep tempo with the rest of the film and rarely adds anything to the story.Hugh Jackman plays the main &#34;good guy&#34; in this tale of international terrorism and national conspiracy. Jackman's character is hired by a man called Gabriel (John Travolta) to hack into a computer system to &#34;rob&#34; the federal government of several billions of dollars and transfer the dough into a foreign account without leaving a trace. As the movie progresses, one becomes aware that Gabriel is either a psychotic international terrorist or one perversely-dedicated secret agent.The movie is full of action, but except for the first five minutes, most of it doesn't happen until the last thirty minutes. Also, there are all kinds of twists, turns, zigs, and zags. Like Jackman's character, the audience never really knows who to trust or who's a &#34;good&#34; guy or who's a &#34;bad&#34; guy. Pieces to the puzzle are scattered throughout, but unless you think like Sherlock Holmes, you won't see them all. A second viewing is almost a must.Though this is an action movie, it is also a thought provoking film. Not only does it keep you guessing about who are the &#34;bad guys&#34; it also raises some important issues concerning democracy, freedom, justice, truth, and the American way.",4,"Twists, Turns, Zigs, and Zags",1021939200,"05 21, 2002",2002,2025,"['really', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'desire', 'watch', 'SWORDFISH', 'was', 'last', 'video', 'left', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'movie', 'starred', 'John', 'Travolta', 'Halle', 'Berry.I', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'how', 'entertaining', 'engaging', 'SWORDFISH', 'was', 'beginning', 'movie', 'confused', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'film', 'progressed', 'going', 'back', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'understand', 'Things', 'were', 'made', 'clear', 'pieces', 'fit', 'confusing', 'yet', 'highly', 'intriguing', 'opening', 'five', 'minutes', 'film', 'movie', 'down', 'considerably', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'again', 'forty', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'action', 'flicks', 'character', 'development', 'usually', ""n't"", 'keep', 'tempo', 'rest', 'film', 'rarely', 'anything', 'story.Hugh', 'Jackman', 'main', '34', 'good', 'guy', '34', 'tale', 'international', 'terrorism', 'national', 'conspiracy', 'Jackman', 'character', 'hired', 'man', 'called', 'Gabriel', 'John', 'Travolta', 'hack', 'computer', 'system', '34', 'rob', '34', 'federal', 'government', 'several', 'billions', 'dollars', 'transfer', 'dough', 'foreign', 'account', 'leaving', 'trace', 'movie', 'one', 'aware', 'Gabriel', 'psychotic', 'international', 'terrorist', 'one', 'perversely-dedicated', 'secret', 'agent.The', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'most', ""n't"", 'happen', 'last', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'Also', 'are', 'kinds', 'twists', 'turns', 'zigs', 'zags', 'Jackman', 'character', 'audience', 'never', 'really', 'who', 'trust', 'who', '34', 'good', '34', 'guy', 'who', '34', 'bad', '34', 'guy', 'Pieces', 'puzzle', 'are', 'scattered', 'think', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'see', 'second', 'viewing', 'almost', 'must.Though', 'action', 'movie', 'also', 'thought', 'provoking', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'keep', 'guessing', 'who', 'are', '34', 'bad', 'guys', '34', 'also', 'important', 'issues', 'concerning', 'democracy', 'freedom', 'justice', 'truth', 'American', 'way']",N/A
