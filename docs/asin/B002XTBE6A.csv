1298223,A1VDRK69F22YMN,B002XTBE6A,Anticlimacus,"[1, 1]","The greatest cinematic invention is this: A cute schoolgirl in a short skirt kicking butt. Yep, I'm a sucker for movies like this. All I ask is that there be plentiful exhibitions of well-choreographed buttkicking by cute schoolgirls. ""High Kick Girl"" provides a lot of this for the opening 50 minutes or so, but then takes a turn for the worse.There are a number of positives to this film. First of all, there is a ton of fighting here. I didn't actually time the length of the action sequences, but it felt like they occupied more than half of the total running time. This is a good thing. Secondly, the martial arts choreography is 100% realistic. Not one move required the use of wires, and most of the actors gave an impressive exhibition. Thirdly, the lead actress has an intimidating, arrogant persona and it's fun watching her taunt and humiliate her opponents. Fourthly, there are a handful of cute schoolgirl baddies that the protagonist battles with. Fifthly, the camera-work uses a lot of wide shots so that the viewer can see everything clearly. There are also some fairly long sequences without cuts or editing gimmicks.Unfortunately, there are a number of negatives to this film as well. The biggest problem is the rampant, undisciplined use of slow motion replays. The viewer is shown a strike at regular speed, followed by a replay of that same strike in slow motion. At first this was useful because some karate strikes are somewhat deceptive and fast, but as the film went on the slow motion just killed the fluidity of the action all together for two reasons. First, slow motion replays were shown for very basic strikes (e.g., a straight kick to the gut), which is worthless. Second, the final confrontation uses sequences that are first shown in slow motion, then replayed in SUPER slow motion. This was a major miscalculation on the part of the filmmakers because the scene just drags and drags into mind-numbing boredom. It felt like they were just padding the running time to break 80 minutes. Not good.Another problem is Rina Takeda's inexplicable turn from intimidating buttkicker to worthless wimp during the middle section. She pummels a whole school of big dudes at the beginning of the film, then goes into a shell and plays victim/hostage for most of the second half. In addition, she was fairly inactive during the finale and only took down one baddie in a not-so-awesome fight. (Tatsuya Naka takes over from there and looks impressive though.) One other thing that bothered me was that this film introduces a really cool, acrobatic schoolgirl villain near the midpoint, only to then completely forget about her for the rest of the movie. This was another terrible decision by the filmmakers that made the final fight even more disappointing because the viewer will automatically expect a throwdown between Takeda and the antagonist schoolgirl. It never happens.I would still recommend ""High Kick Girl"" despite its flaws. There's more than enough fun to make it worthwhile.",3,Entertaining Despite Being Crippled By Excessive Slow Motion,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",2010,3006,"['greatest', 'cinematic', 'invention', 'cute', 'schoolgirl', 'short', 'skirt', 'kicking', 'butt', 'Yep', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'movies', 'ask', 'be', 'plentiful', 'exhibitions', 'well-choreographed', 'buttkicking', 'cute', 'schoolgirls', 'High', 'Kick', 'Girl', 'lot', 'opening', '50', 'minutes', 'so', 'then', 'turn', 'are', 'number', 'positives', 'film', 'First', 'all', 'ton', 'fighting', 'here', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'time', 'length', 'action', 'sequences', 'felt', 'occupied', 'more', 'half', 'total', 'running', 'time', 'good', 'thing', 'Secondly', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', '100', '%', 'realistic', 'Not', 'one', 'move', 'required', 'use', 'wires', 'most', 'actors', 'gave', 'impressive', 'exhibition', 'Thirdly', 'lead', 'actress', 'intimidating', 'arrogant', 'persona', 'fun', 'watching', 'taunt', 'humiliate', 'opponents', 'Fourthly', 'are', 'handful', 'cute', 'schoolgirl', 'baddies', 'protagonist', 'Fifthly', 'camera-work', 'lot', 'wide', 'shots', 'viewer', 'can', 'see', 'everything', 'clearly', 'are', 'also', 'fairly', 'long', 'sequences', 'cuts', 'editing', 'gimmicks.Unfortunately', 'are', 'number', 'negatives', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'biggest', 'problem', 'rampant', 'undisciplined', 'use', 'slow', 'motion', 'replays', 'viewer', 'shown', 'strike', 'regular', 'speed', 'followed', 'replay', 'same', 'strike', 'slow', 'motion', 'first', 'was', 'useful', 'karate', 'strikes', 'are', 'somewhat', 'deceptive', 'fast', 'film', 'went', 'slow', 'motion', 'just', 'killed', 'fluidity', 'action', 'together', 'two', 'reasons', 'First', 'slow', 'motion', 'replays', 'were', 'shown', 'very', 'basic', 'strikes', 'e.g.', 'straight', 'kick', 'gut', 'worthless', 'Second', 'final', 'confrontation', 'sequences', 'are', 'first', 'shown', 'slow', 'motion', 'then', 'replayed', 'SUPER', 'slow', 'motion', 'was', 'major', 'miscalculation', 'part', 'filmmakers', 'scene', 'just', 'drags', 'drags', 'mind-numbing', 'boredom', 'felt', 'were', 'just', 'padding', 'running', 'time', 'break', '80', 'minutes', 'Not', 'good.Another', 'problem', 'Rina', 'Takeda', 'inexplicable', 'turn', 'intimidating', 'buttkicker', 'worthless', 'wimp', 'middle', 'section', 'whole', 'school', 'big', 'dudes', 'beginning', 'film', 'then', 'shell', 'plays', 'victim/hostage', 'most', 'second', 'half', 'addition', 'was', 'fairly', 'inactive', 'finale', 'only', 'took', 'down', 'one', 'baddie', 'not-so-awesome', 'fight', 'Tatsuya', 'Naka', 'impressive', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'bothered', 'was', 'film', 'really', 'cool', 'acrobatic', 'schoolgirl', 'villain', 'midpoint', 'only', 'then', 'completely', 'forget', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'terrible', 'decision', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'final', 'fight', 'even', 'more', 'disappointing', 'viewer', 'will', 'automatically', 'expect', 'throwdown', 'Takeda', 'antagonist', 'schoolgirl', 'never', 'happens.I', 'would', 'still', 'recommend', 'High', 'Kick', 'Girl', 'flaws', 'more', 'enough', 'fun', 'make', 'worthwhile']",High Kick Girl

1298226,AM2DGCZ8F266K,B002XTBE6A,"David A. Douthett ""d2presby""","[0, 0]","What was I expecting? Well, a Japanese school girl that kicks high and often, lots of action, and minimal plot. Oddly, that is what I got, but not quite the way I expected. I imagined a traditional revenge plot with the girl emerging from her shell to become the perfect weapon. Not so much! &lt;SPOILER> Don't read this part. I told you, it's a spoiler! Jump ahead to the other marker there! Okay, if you're still here you must want to know, so she starts off as a cocky thug who goes around beating up karate boys to win respect, and ends up as a humble student, so just the reverse. The boss fight is carried out by the girl's sensei. This works for the plot they have chosen, such as it is, but not for the one you might be expecting. Right, so that should be about it for the spoiling for now. &lt;/SPOILER> There is much more emphasis on the basic philosophy behind karate than I would have expected. Also, whereas a lot of low budget martial arts movies have pretty fake fighting scenes, all the kicks and punches land square in this film! Still carefully choreographed, of course, but they aren't relying on the foley artists. The frequent... almost constant use of slo-mo replay is distracting, but it ensures that we all know the guy really did get kicked in the head. Some impressive talent in karate, if not drama.So the bottom line is there is plenty of action, but it's not the Hollywood or Hong Kong type, and several things to like about this film, but maybe not the ones you are hoping for.",3,Keep expectations in check and enjoy,1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1507,"['What', 'was', 'expecting', 'Well', 'Japanese', 'school', 'girl', 'high', 'often', 'lots', 'action', 'minimal', 'plot', 'Oddly', 'what', 'got', 'not', 'quite', 'way', 'expected', 'imagined', 'traditional', 'revenge', 'plot', 'girl', 'emerging', 'shell', 'become', 'perfect', 'weapon', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'lt', 'SPOILER', '>', 'Do', ""n't"", 'read', 'part', 'told', 'spoiler', 'Jump', 'ahead', 'other', 'marker', 'Okay', ""'re"", 'still', 'here', 'must', 'want', 'know', 'off', 'cocky', 'thug', 'who', 'around', 'beating', 'up', 'karate', 'boys', 'win', 'respect', 'up', 'humble', 'student', 'so', 'just', 'reverse', 'boss', 'fight', 'carried', 'girl', 'sensei', 'plot', 'have', 'chosen', 'such', 'not', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'expecting', 'Right', 'should', 'be', 'spoiling', 'now', 'lt', '>', 'much', 'more', 'emphasis', 'basic', 'philosophy', 'karate', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'Also', 'lot', 'low', 'budget', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'have', 'pretty', 'fake', 'fighting', 'scenes', 'kicks', 'punches', 'land', 'square', 'film', 'Still', 'carefully', 'choreographed', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'relying', 'foley', 'artists', 'frequent', 'almost', 'constant', 'use', 'slo-mo', 'replay', 'distracting', 'know', 'guy', 'really', 'did', 'get', 'kicked', 'head', 'impressive', 'talent', 'karate', 'not', 'drama.So', 'bottom', 'line', 'plenty', 'action', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'type', 'several', 'things', 'like', 'film', 'maybe', 'not', 'ones', 'are', 'hoping']",High Kick Girl

1298229,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002XTBE6A,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[22, 24]","HIGH KICK GIRL (""Hai kikku gru!"") is watchable once you disregard the bare-bones plot, that the characters aren't given much backstory, and that the interaction of the cast rings wooden. The slipshod production values inform you that the film was perhaps budgeted on change that someone dug out from under their sofa cushions. There's a whole lot of amateur in this flick, cinema-wise. The karate stuff, that's the real shizzy.HIGH KICK GIRL is a film of non-firsts in terms of story elements. Kei Tsuchida is a high school girl who demonstrates an aptitude for martial arts, but she's going about it all wrong, or to get all purple-prosy, Kei Tsuchida is straying from the path of righteousness and enlightenment. Kei, still a brown belt, chafes under her sensei Yoshiaki Matsumura's philosophy which stresses the importance of mastering the katas and employing karate primarily for protection and survival. Matsumura preaches: ""In order to be strong, kata practice is best."" But Kei, impatient and in private, sniffs disdainfully at that. Kei would rather show off her skills. Kei has got her swagger on, all plaid mini-skirt and dismissive demeanor.Eager to prove herself, she gains a reputation for hunting black belts, crashing rival dojos and challenging (and humiliating) the teachers. She even ends up wiping out an entire dojo. Wise Master Matsumura disapproves, no surprise, and he riffs on that age-old blah-blah-blah about serenity and violence as a last resort and maybe even about the beauty of bamboo shoots by moonlight and such (okay, I'm paraphrasing). Just to show how much Kei takes her sensei's lecture to heart, she promptly responds to a recruitment offer from a shady organization called the Destroyers. The Destroyers are comprised of thuggish martial artists who basically sell their services for money. And so what a shocker it is that Kei finds herself out of her depth.So, karate isn't the showiest discipline in the realm of martial arts, and yet the big selling point of HIGH KICK GIRL is the realism of the fight scenes. Never mind the thin plot, it just serves as a framing device for what we come to the show for, anyway: the wicked, wicked boots to the head. There are no wire works or CG or stunt doubles, and no actors faking mastery of martial arts. The stars come with bonafide credentials and do their own stuff and take their own lumps. Lithe newcomer Rina Takeda (17 years old during filming) boasts a black belt in Ryukyu Shorin-ryu Karate. The disappointing thing is that she's not featured in more action sequences. She has her best moments when she goes thru a bunch of deadly schoolgirls. Tatsuya Naka, a real karate champion and master, is accomplished as hell and he's got that stoic Sho Kosugi mojo going on. The high-octane final half hour is an action junkie's delight, but it's more a showcase for Naka's sensei-on-a-mission routine, and this would ordinarily be a gripe of mine - because, mind you, the title of the movie isn't HIGH KICK NON-MINI-SKIRT-WEARING SENSEI - except that Naka is pretty impressive when he takes out an army of henchmen and dude isn't even sweating that hard (but again you wonder why the henchmen don't all just bumrush him). Rina does get a chance to wipe the floor with a crazy laughing goon.If it sometimes seems as if vicious kicks and punches were really landing with full force, that's because they probably were. Pity the poor, achy stunt folks after enduring this gauntlet of getting vigorously smacked around. And just to show that these are full contact kicks and strikes being administered, the camera is generous with the gratuitous slow-mo instant replays, even though some of these action shots really don't deserve the one more time treatment. But some do. Occasionally, there is a display of precision and dynamic execution to savor. But I can do without all the posing and staring at a downed opponent. Surprisingly, the sensei is guilty of this bit of melodrama as much as Kei. But I should've gotten a clue when the sensei was caught earlier practicing by a waterfall. How cliched can you get?Disappointingly, the DVD special features don't come with English sub-titles, so unless you speak Japanese, you won't really know what the cast says in the interview portions. But these extras are worth checking out anyway for the behind-the-scenes stuff on the action sequences. There's the 28-minute ""Making Of"" segment; ""Rina's Action Techniques"" (almost 6 minutes) - Rina conducting demos and going thru workout drills which definitely include sparring; ""Naka's Action Techniques"" (46 minutes) - Rina and two male voices (I'm assuming Tatsuya Naka and director Fuyuhiko Nishi) provide commentary during the shooting of the fight sequences (you also get to see Rina kick a cigarette off a guy's lips and a water bottle off a guy's dome).HIGH KICK GIRL came out roughly a year after CHOCOLATE, and Rina Takeda reminds me some of CHOCOLATE's Muay Thai-wielding Jeeja Yanin, although Rina isn't as flashy or stylish. But CHOCOLATE had more to offer in the way of depth, so maybe Rina falls short and seems more mechanical because of the lack of story content and an adequate platform from which she could really strut her stuff. I get the definite sense that Rina Takeda is nothing to sneeze at. I know she can clobber the eff out of you and me. I hope to see her in a better film project soon.",3,Real-life martial artist Rina Takeda and her many mini-skirted boots to the head,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",2010,5387,"['HIGH', 'KICK', 'GIRL', 'Hai',

1298232,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B002XTBE6A,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""High-Kick Girl!"" is the directorial debut project for both filmmaker Fuyuhiko Nishi and leading (little) lady Rina Takeda. It's also the first Japanese low-budget picture I've seen of its kind, so I cannot judge it against anything else, but judged completely by itself, the movie is an interesting project with as many high points (and kicks!) as it has low points. Ultimately, it's noteworthy but not a must-see for anyone besides fans of Takeda, who definitely has the potential to become a major martial arts star.The story: a physically prodigious high school girl (Takeda) is obsessed with earning her black belt in karate, but when her inability to master the forms of the art hold back her advancement, she ""hunts"" legitimate black belt holders, beating them up and taking their belts as prizes. This gains her the attention of a crime conglomerate called the Destroyers, who will use her to get at her mysterious master (Tatsuya Naka,Black Belt).Plot-wise, the movie is unbalanced: about half of the film focuses on Takeda's character before abruptly turning into an entirely different, more conventional vehicle for Tatsuya Naka as his character attempts to physically and spiritually save his young prot&eacute;g&eacute;. The ambiguity with which his relationship to the bad guys is handled is disappointing, but complaints aside, I actually really like the essence of this story. Rina starts off as more of a villain than anything else, but it's nevertheless a lot of fun watching her physically bully guys who underestimate her for her size and brown belt status; she's such an entertaining brat. More significant is the overlying theme of the picture, which examines the ""technique vs. power"" and ""tradition vs. practicality"" arguments of modern martial arts. Though she seeks her own black belt, Takeda's character can't make sense of the traditional forms she's expected to learn and is therefore held back despite her skill as a fighter, whereas Naka's character laments her lack of discipline despite acknowledging that she's his most powerful student. In the end, the argument gets a bit one-sided, but it continues to give the film some substance that would've otherwise been lacking.""High-Kick Girl!"" was advertised as a 100% legitimate martial arts film produced without stunt doubles, and I'm pretty sure this is indeed the case...for better or worse. There is no denying that almost every performer you see here is a physical specimen, whether it's the jump-kickers and tricksters or the grounded participants...but sometimes, it seems like they just don't know how to hit eachother. Rather, they do but you can see that they're trying not to legitimately hurt eachother. Stuntmen who are used to selling blows would have taken care of this problem, but this isn't as annoying the issue posed by the film's tendency to continually replay sequences of the fights in slow motion. Let me elaborate: these are not money shots that the film is replaying for dramatic effect, but entire lengthy exchanges that it replays in slow motion immediately after they've happened, even if the slow motion reveals unsteadiness in the choreography. With that said, I still give the fight content an overall passing grade, thanks to a few exceptionally painful-looking kicks - including a windmill kick through a table and a skull-breaking dropkick - and the ultimately exceptional randori staged by Tatsuya Naka's character near the end of the movie, bringing the legitimate lethalness of traditional karate to the forefront.The relentless handheld camerawork makes it clear how ultimately cheap of a movie this is, but I don't mind since it's done well. I wish the individual members of the Destroyers were a bit more diverse as characters, but that's just me. Overall, the movie is several steps above passable, and if nothing else has done its duty in getting young Rina intobigger and better-looking movies. ""High-Kick Girl!"" isn't a pink movie, so don't expect any nudity.

1298234,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,B002XTBE6A,trashcanman,"[10, 11]","So I decided to give this movie ""High Kick Girl"" a try in spite of it's moronic title. Why? Because I like girls. Girls who kick high are a plus. I expected a cheesy, stupid popcorn flick possibly with a great sense of humor and some sweet action. I got more than I expected, but also less. High Kick Girl is a film with a split personality disorder that aims much higher than you would expect and almost hits all the marks it's shooting for, but in the end winds up only half-fulfilling any of them. Martial-arts fanatics shouldn't hesitate to rush out and see it, but be expecting some major letdowns to go along with some outstanding awesomeness. I will dedicate a paragraph to each personality this film displays and list the successes and failures of each in this review to give you an idea of what this film is and what it should have been.First and foremost, High Kick Girl kicks butt. Anytime you see a DVD with a Japanese schoolgirl kicking high, you expect nonstop cheese and exploitation. However, what surprised me is how amazingly skilled the cast of this film are. Right from the first scene featuring star Rina Takeda arrogantly walking through the middle of a line of practicing karatekas up to the biggest black belt and kicking him straight in the head before leveling the rest of the school, I thought to myself ""this girl is the real deal"". Almost like a female Bruce Lee in her skill and fight charisma. And hell yes, there are homages to the fallen martial-arts hero aplenty. The beauty, technique, and power of karate are on full display throughout this film and a lot of it is downright awe-inspiring. Unfortunately, even this simplest aspect is screwed up. You see, the director is apparently a bit of a hack so after shooting these brilliant and hard-hitting fight scenes which were more than great just on their own, he decided he was going to use slow motion in nearly every shot. I would guess that this already short film (80 minutes) is lengthened by as much as 30% based on the ridiculously pervasive slo-mo. Some entire fights are in slow motion, and some use slo-mo instant replay of every single exchange shot-by-shot. They literally interrupt duels in progress in this film to show you replays of what you just saw whether it was impressive or not. Certainly, there were times I really appreciated the replays because it saved me the trouble of rewinding a particularly jaw-dropping move, but I've never ever seen a movie with this much unnecessary slow motion. This is the single worst thing about High Kick Girl.So what about the exploitation factor? It's about a schoolgrl who kicks high, right? Well, yeah, and there is some pretty hot girl-on-girl violence early on and plenty of beautiful, sexily-dressed martial arts femme fatales to go around. But this is actually quite a serious film so no really overt exploitation is present. In fact, the star of the film -after thrilling me early on and leaving me drooling for more- pretty much sits out the second half of the film while her sensei literally takes over the movie and takes down the bad guys (who all wear black to the heroes' white, of course) while the title character is helpless. Sure, she gets one last fight in, but it's much less impressive then the early skirmishes. However, I did learn how to knock out a guy who laughs off multiple head kicks without even blocking. But there is no big showdown with any of the opposing factor's killer beauties. Double-You Tea Eff. So again, a major strength of the film becomes a weakness in the end. Boo.High Kick Girl is a true martial-arts film. I was surprised by the film's deep philosophical exploration of karate. It has surely been done before, but I obviously was not expecting it with this flick. What I love about Eastern martial-arts is that they apply not only to combat and self-defense, but to everything you do in life. Lessons learned practicing kendo, escrima, karate, or wushu are transferable to any other form of combat with or without weapons and also in philosophy, business, or any other goal you seek to acheive. The sensei and hero of this piece teaches his students that karate is not for fighting. It is for survival. At one point, the invincible warrior humbles himself and grovels before inferior foes in an attempt to avoid violence. This is damn near unheard of in action films and I applaud it. Having the power to conquer and do harm but being humble and wise enough to choose not to use that power is the ultimate ideal for a true martial-artist in my opinion. This is the one aspect of the film that doesn't manage to contradict itself, but it also does not build upon this as much as it could have as far as allowing the star to grow. While she learns her lesson, it is not from her own experience, but from watching her sensei in action. More participation from the title character in applying the lessons to her own art would have sealed the deal.Even with it's identity crisis, High Kick Girl is a must-see for fans of martial-arts. The incessant slow motion may have you pulling your hair out, but you'll still want to see this. I'm sorry the direction was awful and the script was half-baked and the title is misleading because this was something that could have been truly special. But as it is, it still has some of the baddest fight scenes this side of Tony Jaa and the heart of a true martial-arts film. Plus it's got a girl who kicks high. And who doesn't love that?  For every plus, there is an unnecessary minus so I ended up being very disappointed with the movie, but at the same time if it hadn't built me up so masterfully in the beginning, I wouldn't have had anything to be disappointed about. I wasn't expecting much so even the eventual letdown is a function of High Kick Girl being more than it should have been in the first place given the premise so in the end I've got to recommend it.",3,Osu!,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,5892,"['So', 'decided', 'give', 'movie', 'High', 'Kick', 'Girl', 'try', 'spite', 'moronic', 'title', 'Why', 'like', 'girls', 'Girls', 'who', 'kick', 'high',

1298235,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B002XTBE6A,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[4, 4]","Ever since Jeeja Yanin made her debut as a premier female martial arts superstar in ""Chocolate"", I knew it was only a matter of time before real-life female martial artists made it to the big screen. Well, Female Karate Champion Rina Takeda makes her debut in ""HIGH-KICK GIRL"" (aka. Hai Kikku Garu) that also showcases a good number of real-life martial arts practitioners. The fight scenes were shot with no stunt men, no wires with realistic choreography; and it makes this its main draw. But it does define the spirit of Karate within the simplicity of its plot.Kei Tsuchiya (Rina Takeda) is a pupil of a man called Matsumura (Tatsuya Naka, Black Belt) who proves to be the most capable fighter in the dojo. However for some reason, she is denied a black belt by her sensei. Restless, she goes around challenging other masters in other dojo's to prove her skills but Matsumura remains unconvinced. Restless and frustrated, Kei takes up a challenge from a rogue group of expert fighters called ""The Destroyers""; this group cares for nothing except money and power--which may suit Kei's needs to prove her strength to her master. Little does she know that this group is after Matsumura's head. Now, Kei is the bait and she must learn what it really means to become a true practitioner of KARATE...What I really appreciated about ""High Kick Girl"" is the fact that it pays respect to the teachings of Karate. The film is directed by the producer of ""Shaolin Girl"" (how come I haven't reviewed this yet?) and the fight choreographer of ""Black Belt"" so expect the film to follow some of the established elements about films about Karate. It was good, as the viewer is taken to a side that defines the art and its use in real fights and the real world. ""Karate is a martial art that guarantees protection and survival"" and the film brings the definition of the art to exposition. The film Black Belt defined the philosophies, the practice and the beliefs of the arts in a way that was truly awe-inspiring. Now, look at this film from the eyes of the student and her impressions of her sensei; then you will understand what the film is trying to say.The film's premise is admittedly simple but most stories that express the philosophies of martial arts usually are. Why? Because its beauty is in its simplicity. Sure, the film's story could have been more ambitious and intricate but for a low-budget film, it does what it set out to do with a lot of credibility. The film's plot revolves around the fight sequences which were excellently executed but I have to be honest, the direction needed to be more polished. First-time director Fuyuhiko Nishi seemed to have gotten a little too over-zealous in the execution of the fights. I know his intentions were to spotlight the non-stuntmen, no-wires execution that displays the beauty of the movements of Karate, but the ""instant replay"" hampered the intensity that could be felt in the fights. Don't get me wrong, the moves were real good, but too much slo-mo and replays can overstay its welcome. But......the fights were performed by real-life martial artists and they do look very realistic. The moves are simple (remember you don't get to do complex moves in real fights) but they were impressive in a way that they looked like they were making contact; and the end credits do show the execution of the fights. This gives the fights a lot of credible impact in its narrative. As in ""Black Belt"", Tatsuya Naka is incredibly bad ass; his moves are fluid, powerful and effective. This was one of the times that I did NOT mind the slo-mo at all. Rina Takeda's performance in the fights were very good, but remember she plays a pupil so as much as her moves were effective, they were a little awkward at first (too ""showy"") to express the idea that she is still a novice and extremely overconfident with her skills. Real Life fighters such as Hisae Watanabe (too many of them to list, but they do get introduced in the scenes as a ""destroyer"") also makes an appearance to display her skills in one of the film's best scenes. I do still insist that it is easier to teach a real-life martial artist to act than to teach an actor to do martial arts.I've said that the film's plot is very simple and I have to admit that the film has a lot of plot holes in the screenplay, but one isn't exactly here for the story. ""High Kick Girl"" will get its attention from martial arts fans and they are here to watch the fights. Still, the film does define the meaning of a ""belt"" and that it doesn't usually represent the greatness of one's skill but rather the purity of one's spirit. Notice Matsumura's ""Kuro Obi"" in the film, it is worn out and used up--to represent wisdom and spirituality achieved through time.Recommended!
