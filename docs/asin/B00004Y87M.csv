Having been exposed to the act of lovemaking, ... physical love, or however people describe the emotional and physical act, I was impressed with how the film turned out. It may have an '80's version of the 1967 film The Graduate, but it was a joy to watch. British actress Jacqueline Bisset not only radiates her beauty, but she also radiates someone who is sad, if not depressed. Andrew McCarthy (in his first role) does an excellent job of playing a young man who changes from a nerd type to a suave and debonair ladies man. This film was, in many ways, one of the brat pack films, and starred many actors from that era who were just getting started in the industry. Not only are the ... love scenes between Andrew and Jacqueline convincing, they are beautiful and moving. The rest of the film is also enjoyable to watch. If you enjoyed the era of the 1980's and older, beautiful, and sophisticated women characters, then you'll enjoy this hilarious, if not moving film.*Andrew McCarthy stated in an interview that he must have been doing something right when he was offered the role.

558713,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B00004Y87M,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[14, 18]","The mid 80s...sadly, the biggest event during this period in my life was the introduction of cable into my household, and all the cathode tubular promise it held...I actually skipped school one day to stay home and watch The Road Warrior...it was totally worth it, but I'm not recommending any of you youngins' out there to follow my lead...remember, as Mr. T said, `Only a fool skips out on school!'...well, maybe he didn't, but it does sounds like something he'd say, right?  As one just coming into his formulative teen years, it afforded me, among other things, the opportunity to see all kinds of naughty, naughty movies (thank you Cinemax, or as we called it, Skinamax) primarily due to the fact this was before the time of programmable parental control features...the only control feature back then was the chance of your mother coming downstairs and beating you silly for watching something she didn't approve of...anyway, this was how I first saw the film Class (1983), a movie I watched again last night for the first time in about 20 years.  Directed by Lewis John Carlino (The Great Santini), the film stars Rob Lowe, whom we saw three years earlier dealing with the crisis of being a schoolboy father in an After School Special aptly titled `Schoolboy Father', Andrew McCarthy (St. Elmo's Fire, Mannequin), in his screen debut, and Jacqueline Bisset, who, in my opinion, is responsible for single-handedly introducing the wet T-shirt fad from her role in the film The Deep (1977).  Also appearing is Cliff Robertson (Charly, Three Days of the Condor), Alan `Cameron' Ruck (Ferris Bueller's Day Off) along with a number of now famous actors for whom this was their first film, including John Cusack (The Grifters), Virginia Madsen (Electric Dreams), Casey Siemaszko (Biloxi Blues), and Lolita Davidovich (Blaze).McCarthy plays Jonathan Onger, a highly intelligent, yet awkward and introverted young man from a modest (poor) family with dreams of attending Harvard Law School, and is on his way after receiving a scholarship to a prestigious prep school.  On arriving, Jonathan meets his roommate in Franklin 'Skip' Burroughs IV (Lowe), whose basically the exact opposite of Jonathan in that Skip is charming, outgoing, well groomed, polished, and just generally sure of himself to a fault...oh yeah, he also comes from an extremely affluent family (which you could have probably guessed given a name like that).  Anyway, Jonathan has a difficult time fitting in (not helped by a very public practical joke played on him by Skip on the first day), but finds a certain amount of respect after he turns the tables on Skip, basically giving as good as he got...the two become fast friends as Jonathan helps Skip with his scholastic difficulties while Skip helps Jonathan with his social inadequacies.  After an incident at the sister school while planning an upcoming dance, Jonathan isn't allow to attend, but Skip convinces him to got to nearby Chicago for some much needed action, which he does, and how...in that of a vibrant, attractive, classy, sophisticated, older woman named Ellen (Bisset), who initially takes pity on the poor schlub, eventually molesting him in an elevator (pity sex...it's a beautiful thing).  Anyway, the two spend the weekend together, after which Jonathan returns a hero to his fellow classmates, inundated with a newfound respect.  The relationship continues hot and heavy, and we can see Jonathan is falling in love (guys generally fall in love with the first woman they get it on with), but Ellen's only interested in a fling, and after learning Jonathan's actually a high school student (he made himself out to be a college man), she quickly takes off, leaving him depressed and heartbroken...and then things get better, as Jonathan finds he's been accepted into Harvard...but things quickly go down the proverbial toilet as certain events take place, including, but not limited to, an investigation at the school regarding widespread fraud...with circumstances threatening Jonathan's friendship with Skip along with his academic future...First of all, if you're coming into this movie expecting some flesh, you're probably going to be disappointed as Bisset never bares all (very little, in fact), as the only scene displaying anything features Virginia Madsen suffering from a serious wardrobe malfunction eerily reminiscent of the Janet Jackson/Justin Timberlake Superbowl fiasco.  This was kind of a strange film in that respect, as it started of with the seeming intent of being sort of a teen sex comedy, but changes course about halfway through dealing with material of a more serious nature (which ends up getting severely slighted).  The transition was smooth, but didn't go unnoticed.  One thing that surprised me a little was that while the characters were essentially stereotypical, there was little animosity towards Jonathan from his wealthy peers in terms of his coming from a comparatively poor family...yeah, they didn't care for him much in the beginning, but that was more from the fact he was a nerdy dink than anything else.  Overall I did enjoy this film, despite its inadequacies, as the actors managed to add dimensionality to what could have been very shallow characters, but there is a sense of unreality in terms of Jonathan hooking up with Ellen as it provided false hope to those of us males who saw this at an impressionable age, believing that there were actually incredibly beautiful, vivacious, wealthy, older women out there looking to have intimate relations with gawky, awkward, nave, inexperienced teenage boys...perhaps there are, but I never met one, and neither did any of my peers.  Jonathan was presented as an extremely pitiful character (especially in terms of being a target of a few practical jokers), but I found it hard to accept Ellen would willingly pursue him the way she did, despite any amount of pity or alcohol (later we find out she might be mentally deranged, which could explain a lot).  This isn't a putdown towards Mr. McCarthy, but more towards the unrealistic aspect of the story...but then again, Hollywood relies on suspension of disbelief from its audiences (sometimes too much), so if you can get past this, you'll enjoy the movie a whole lot more.  One really strange aspect was the abruptness of the ending...seems like there should have been more story...The picture, available in both widescreen (1.85:1) and fullscreen pan & scan formats, looks very good, but the Dolby Digital 2.0 audio felt a little soft, specifically during the dialog (oddly, the music came through loud and clear).  There's nothing really in terms of special features, unless you count an original theatrical trailer, which I don't (to me that's a standard feature, and not an extra).Cookieman108",4,"""You look like

I could only recall a mediocre teen dramedy starring two Brat Packers, but this script is as smart and funny as it is flawed. Jonathan (Andrew McCarthy) is a working class young man who attends a posh prep school his senior year in hopes of getting into Harvard. His introduction to Vernon Academy is a humiliating prank played by his rich roommate Skip (Rob Lowe), but after a few bumps, they become fast friends. Determined to help Jonathan out with the ladies, Skip packs him off to a pick-up bar in Chicago one weekend. In spite of his clumsiness -or because of it- Jonathan meets an exciting older woman named Ellen (Jacqueline Bisset), and they begin an affair. But Ellen eventually discovers Jonathan's age. And Jonathan discovers that Ellen is Skip's mother.The prep school antics really are funny, not just tired sophomoric jokes. The scene of the Vernon Academy dance committee's disastrous meeting with their counterparts at nearby Foxfield girls' school is among the funniest slapstick I've seen. I like the rapport between Jonathan and Skip, characters from disparate backgrounds who share an easy-going nature. And Rob Lowe was looking his best in 1983. Andrew McCarthy looks pasty but still charming. I either never noticed or had forgotten the film's clever jabs at ideologues on both ends of the political spectrum. The leftist rich girls theorizing about the problems of the poor are hilarious. They're counterbalanced by the laissez-faire businessman who insists upon protectionist trade. ""Class"" is definitely not intended to be political, but it doesn't ignore what's going on in the periphery or underwrite those scenes.""Class"" has a confused tone after Ellen's identity is discovered, however. The change is abrupt and vacillates between the comic and the serious for the rest of the movie. The film seems not to know quite what it's trying to be at that point. I think that introducing Ellen's problems into the story was probably a mistake. It would have been better had she not had a personality change but simply acted as a person caught in an awkward situation would. But the comedic elements of ""Class"" are good, and Jonathan and Skip are an enjoyable duo.The DVD (MGM 2000): The disc is 2-sided, with a full screen pan and scan version on one side and widescreen format on the other.

As I was just a kid when it came out, I did not really understand a lot of things other than the practical jokes that were played between the students and the sense of humiliation.  Then again, that's what the horrors of high school are all about, whether it's a public institution or a prep school.Having survived prep school myself (albiet a single sex one and I am a woman), there was the sense of overprivledge and little to no reguard for others.  Yet, I realize that's what high school is all about based on chats with others.  Andrew McCarthy comes to a prep school and meets his new roommate, Rob Lowe.  They become reluctant if not oddly bonded fast friends (since Rob plays that terrible practical joke on him in the women's underwear and Andrew with the hangman).  As roommates, they become classic frienemies and are in a constant pissing contest to one up the other, as all guys do.  Then, as all guys do, Rob sends Andrew off to meet some girls and become sexually active.  Andrew does just that, jumping in bed with an older woman he meets in Chicago.  Imagine the horror when Andrew discovers that the woman he bedded was not just much older, but Rob's own mother.This is just about every young man's fantasy mixed with smutty humor, obnoxious behaviors, and crazy.  But that's what these relationships are all about.  Andrew is not a true blue hero, in that he did, after all, lie to the mother telling her he is older than he really is.  Neither is Rob, as he is rather ridiculous in his practical jokes and insistance that his friend become sexually active.  In short, it's just a big mess.  This is not the behavior of the rich and privledged, to be sure, but all the hilarious things that we don't want to admit.  We are insecure, we are unhappy, we reach out to others to find happiness only to find it crash down upon us.  It's part of the growing pains.  It's not the most profound of statements, but we find our way no matter what socio economic bracket we come from.",3,Cross between The Graduate and Porky's and Dead Poet's Society,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2072,"['just', 'saw', 'movie', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'having', 'not', 'seen', 'many', 'years', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'really', 'understand', 'lot', 'things', 'other', 'practical', 'jokes', 'were', 'played', 'students', 'sense', 'humiliation', 'Then', 'again', 'what', 'horrors', 'high', 'school', 'are', 'public', 'institution', 'prep', 'school.Having', 'survived', 'prep', 'school', 'albiet', 'single', 'sex', 'one', 'am', 'woman', 'was', 'sense', 'overprivledge', 'little', 'reguard', 'others', 'realize', 'what', 'high', 'school', 'based', 'chats', 'others', 'Andrew', 'McCarthy', 'prep', 'school', 'new', 'roommate', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'become', 'reluctant', 'not', 'oddly', 'bonded', 'fast', 'friends', 'Rob', 'terrible', 'practical', 'joke', 'women', 'underwear', 'Andrew', 'hangman', 'roommates', 'become', 'classic', 'frienemies', 'are', 'constant', 'pissing', 'contest', 'one', 'up', 'other', 'guys', 'do', 'Then', 'guys', 'do', 'Rob', 'Andrew', 'meet', 'girls', 'become', 'sexually', 'active', 'Andrew', 'just', 'jumping', 'bed', 'older', 'woman', 'Chicago', 'Imagine', 'horror', 'when', 'Andrew', 'woman', 'bedded', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'much', 'older', 'Rob', 'own', 'mother.This', 'just', 'about', 'young', 'man', 'fantasy', 'mixed', 'smutty', 'humor', 'obnoxious', 'behaviors', 'crazy', 'what', 'relationships', 'are', 'Andrew', 'not', 'true', 'blue', 'hero', 'did', 'mother', 'telling', 'older', 'really', 'Rob', 'rather', 'ridiculous', 'practical', 'jokes', 'insistance', 'friend', 'become', 'sexually', 'active', 'short', 'just', 'big', 'mess', 'not', 'behavior', 'rich', 'privledged', 'be', 'sure', 'hilarious', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'admit', 'are', 'insecure', 'are', 'unhappy', 'reach', 'out', 'others', 'find', 'happiness', 'only', 'find', 'crash', 'down', 'part', 'growing', 'pains', 'not', 'most', 'profound', 'statements', 'find', 'way', 'matter', 'what', 'economic', 'bracket', 'come']",N/A
