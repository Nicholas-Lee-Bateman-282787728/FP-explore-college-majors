1291129,A2ZHB7E544QLLQ,B002V0BAJC,"Jon Hunt ""musician, teacher""","[1, 1]","Having seen and heard Angela Meade in Verdi's ""Ernani"" at the Met this past season, I was made aware of this wonderful documentary which follows the path of the 2007 Met auditions, of which Meade, herself, was a part. What a wonderful treat! Eleven finalists are chosen from a much larger group and the film captures not only the beauty of their collective voices, but the tension backstage as they rehearse and then finally sing their chosen arias.What makes the documntary so enticing are the different personalities that emerge. There's the edgy Michael Fabiano, the self-assured Angela Meade, the playful Kiera Duffy, the engaging Ryan Smith and the absoultely appealing Alek Shrader. In the end, five winners are chosen from the eleven, (I won't divulge who they are) but the viewer might be able to pick out the ones who are destined to win, though that's not an easy task.""The Audition"" is a must-see for opera lovers but is just as fascinating for those who might not follow opera. In any case, it's a winning film and I most highly recommend it.",5,Terrific on every level,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,1054,"['Having', 'seen', 'heard', 'Angela', 'Meade', 'Verdi', 'Ernani', 'Met', 'past', 'season', 'was', 'made', 'aware', 'wonderful', 'documentary', 'path', '2007', 'Met', 'auditions', 'Meade', 'was', 'part', 'What', 'wonderful', 'treat', 'Eleven', 'finalists', 'are', 'chosen', 'much', 'larger', 'group', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'beauty', 'collective', 'voices', 'tension', 'backstage', 'rehearse', 'then', 'finally', 'sing', 'chosen', 'documntary', 'enticing', 'are', 'different', 'personalities', 'emerge', 'edgy', 'Michael', 'Fabiano', 'self-assured', 'Angela', 'Meade', 'playful', 'Kiera', 'Duffy', 'engaging', 'Ryan', 'Smith', 'absoultely', 'appealing', 'Alek', 'Shrader', 'end', 'five', 'winners', 'are', 'chosen', 'eleven', 'wo', ""n't"", 'divulge', 'who', 'are', 'viewer', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'pick', 'out', 'ones', 'who', 'are', 'destined', 'win', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'Audition', 'must-see', 'opera', 'lovers', 'just', 'fascinating', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'follow', 'opera', 'case', 'winning', 'film', 'most', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

1291131,A3FMZ98X1GIYV9,B002V0BAJC,S. McGee,"[36, 37]","Opera is an aging art form, as Met Opera honcho Peter Gelb points out to the successful candidates for the 2007 National Council Finals. And yet, in this riveting documentary, nearly a dozen men and women, most of whom are under the age of 30, have committed their lives to singing repertoire that is deeply out of fashion with most of their peers. And they do it -- peerlessly. It's a glimpse behind the scenes, literally, to the years of training that they have undergone and the 10 minutes or so they will have on stage that will make them or (possibly) break them. There's an African American from Texas, who's had the bailiffs show up at his door; an Icelandic singer who's a star at home and wants an international career; and a guy from New Jersey, whose ambition radiates from him with the same manic intensity that his voice projects audibly. (As one judge later says, he'll either be great, or he'll be dead.) The music never overwhelms the characters (or vice versa) and the viewer is treated to lots of insight into what makes a good opera singer better, from breathing to dramatic technique. Then there's the competition... It's impossible not to root for your favorite singers in this. Watching this has convinced me to buy a ticket to the 'real thing' this year.Highly recommended to anyone with an interest of any kind in music, or even someone who just likes great documentaries.",5,"Wow.
