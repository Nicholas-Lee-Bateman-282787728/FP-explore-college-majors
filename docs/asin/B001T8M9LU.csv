The people at Unsolved Mysteries should get there head out of there butts and released Best of Ghost Volume 2. They have plenty of material with over 16 seasons on tv, it'd be easy to make at more ghost story dvds.

Now the Unsolved Mysteries ghost edition (2 cd's) is a segment of many from what the television show broadcasted. Simply,this ghost edition is just creepy to watch and not to mention the background music along with host Robert Stack voice gives it a scarier feeling. So overall, this is a great dvd to watch with friends,family etc.",5,Oh! a classic television series on dvd and it is terrific.,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",2012,531,"['Okay', 'let', 'first', 'start', 'saying', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'then', 'maybe', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'were', ""n't"", 'born', 'yet', 'way', 'now', 'chance', 'see', 'really', 'strange', 'things', 'happening', 'Now', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'ghost', 'edition', '2', 'cd', 'segment', 'many', 'what', 'television', 'show', 'broadcasted', 'Simply', 'ghost', 'edition', 'just', 'creepy', 'watch', 'not', 'mention', 'background', 'music', 'host', 'Robert', 'Stack', 'voice', 'scarier', 'feeling', 'So', 'overall', 'great', 'dvd', 'watch', 'friends', 'family', 'etc']",Unsolved Mysteries: Ghosts 1

1235717,A3UIBKQBKF0PKV,B001T8M9LU,"Jonathan Turbide ""The Investigator""","[3, 4]","So back in 2007 I bought the Original ""Unsolved Mysteries: Ghosts"" DVD Set ( 4 Discs, 6 Hours ). Since Disc 2 of my set had flaws ( a little predictable, after 5 long years and numerous hours spent in a DVD player ), I decided to buy this Set containing only Disc 1 and 2 of the original Set. Even if this set only contains 2 discs instead of 4 I have to admit that this is a very good collection of ghost stories. On this 2-Disc collection you'll find some very interesting segments: ""Queen Mary Ghost"", ""The Entity"", ""Resurrection Mary"", the case of Theresita Basa, ""Ghost Lights"", ""Civil War Ghosts"", ""Ghost Blimp"", and many others. So for less than 15$ I was satisfied, and since the original 4-Disc collection is difficult to find I think this set is a very good buy. After all UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is one of the greatest TV shows ever produced.Here's the problem: I have read that they won't release a Volume 2. This is really disappointing. They did the same thing with the Boxset about Bizarre murders, they only released Volume 1 and they won't release Volume 2.I am aware that In late 2010, First Look Studios ceased operations and declared bankruptcy. However the new owner, Millenium Entertainment, can't release new Boxsets !? The most frustrating part of all this is the fact they, the producers or whoever made the DVDs, have decided they won't release any other Unsolved Mysteries Boxset in the near future. Unsolved Mysteries recorded more than 250 episodes, there's hundreds and hundreds of fascinating Murder cases that will never be released on DVD, they could have released at least six or seven 4 discs Boxset about murder cases. Or what about a Boxset about Missing people ?? Sadly there's enough segments to release a 6 hours DVD set, it would have been amazing, without a doubt a must-own. Thank god for Youtube, where you can find most of the episodes.",3,A Great Set; Just don't Expect a Volume 2,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",2012,1876,"['So', 'back', '2007', 'bought', 'Original', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'Ghosts', 'DVD', 'Set', '4', 'Discs', '6', 'Hours', 'Disc', '2', 'set', 'had', 'flaws', 'little', 'predictable', '5', 'long', 'years', 'numerous', 'hours', 'spent', 'DVD', 'player', 'decided', 'buy', 'Set', 'containing', 'only', 'Disc', '1', '2', 'original', 'Set', 'Even', 'set', 'only', '2', 'discs', 'instead', '4', 'have', 'admit', 'very', 'good', 'collection', 'ghost', 'stories', '2-Disc', 'collection', ""'ll"", 'find', 'very', 'interesting', 'segments', 'Queen', 'Mary', 'Ghost', 'Entity', 'Resurrection', 'Mary', 'case', 'Theresita', 'Basa', 'Ghost', 'Lights', 'Civil', 'War', 'Ghosts', 'Ghost', 'Blimp', 'many', 'others', 'So', 'less', '15', 'was', 'satisfied', 'original', '4-Disc', 'collection', 'difficult', 'find', 'think', 'set', 'very', 'good', 'buy', 'UNSOLVED', 'MYSTERIES', 'one', 'greatest', 'TV', 'shows', 'ever', 'produced.Here', 'problem', 'have', 'read', 'wo', ""n't"", 'release', 'Volume', '2', 'really', 'disappointing', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'Boxset', 'Bizarre', 'murders', 'only', 'released', 'Volume', '1', 'wo', ""n't"", 'release', 'Volume', '2.I', 'am', 'aware', 'late', '2010', 'First', 'Look', 'Studios', 'ceased', 'operations', 'declared', 'bankruptcy', 'However', 'new', 'owner', 'Millenium', 'Entertainment', 'ca', ""n't"", 'release', 'new', 'Boxsets', 'most', 'frustrating', 'part', 'fact', 'producers', 'made', 'DVDs', 'have', 'decided', 'wo', ""n't"", 'release', 'other', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'Boxset', 'near', 'future', 'Unsolved', 'Mysteries', 'recorded', 'more', '250', 'episodes', 'hundreds', 'hundreds', 'fascinating', 'Murder', 'cases', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'released', 'least', 'six', 'seven', '4', 'discs', 'Boxset', 'murder', 'cases', 'what', 'Boxset', 'Missing', 'people', 'Sadly', 'enough', 'segments', 'release', '6', 'hours', 'DVD', 'set', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'amazing', 'doubt', 'must-own', 'Thank', 'god', 'Youtube', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'most', 'episodes']",Unsolved Mysteries: Ghosts 1
