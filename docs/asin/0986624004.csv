167660,A1UMF3UZ035FKD,0986624004,Nora Quick,"[0, 0]","I was born in 1980, and in 1984 I was diagnoses &#34;hyper-kinetic&#34; (an archaic term for ADHD) and dosed with Ritalin which made me a zombie. In 1986 I went off it. I was expelled/suspended many times, had numerous &#34;behavioral problems&#34;, and have had moments of brilliant success and long stretches of failure. I never knew all that was tied to ADHD.I have other friends with ADHD and we try to talk about it but somehow we end up driving to a comic book shop buying several volumes and then going to see a movie. Seriously, that happened once.As a woman, no one seems to believe I have it because of the mis-beliefs out there. Even I thought if Ritalin zombied me, all ADHD meds would too. This documentary is fun and informative, and structured cleverly so those of you with ADHD will be able to sit through it...well, with only 7 or eight &#34;get up and stretch my legs&#34; breaks.I only have one compliant, and that is I would have liked a bit more of a case-study approach showing someone with untreated ADHD and how their life could change with medication and coaching, but the tidbits of info helped.I think this is essential to watch if you have a loved one with ADHD or ADD. It's extremely hard for us to explain what it's like to you because we don;t know what it means to be normal. As one man interviewed on the street said, when his child's doctor read off the symptoms of ADHD he had to ask, &#34;You mean that's not normal?&#34;It's great information for parents of an ADD/ADHD child or an adult with the disorder. Watching this, if you suffer from the condition, will darn near break your heart when all the little pieces of your life you never could figure out suddenly have an explanation.",5,As an adult with ADHD I wish al my friends and family would see this,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",2014,1721,"['was', 'born', '1980', '1984', 'was', 'diagnoses', '34', 'hyper-kinetic', '34', 'archaic', 'term', 'ADHD', 'dosed', 'Ritalin', 'made', 'zombie', '1986', 'went', 'was', 'expelled/suspended', 'many', 'times', 'had', 'numerous', '34', 'behavioral', 'problems', '34', 'have', 'had', 'moments', 'brilliant', 'success', 'long', 'stretches', 'failure', 'never', 'knew', 'was', 'tied', 'ADHD.I', 'have', 'other', 'friends', 'ADHD', 'try', 'talk', 'end', 'up', 'driving', 'comic', 'book', 'shop', 'buying', 'several', 'volumes', 'then', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'Seriously', 'happened', 'once.As', 'woman', 'one', 'believe', 'have', 'mis-beliefs', 'there', 'Even', 'thought', 'Ritalin', 'zombied', 'ADHD', 'meds', 'would', 'too', 'documentary', 'fun', 'informative', 'structured', 'cleverly', 'so', 'ADHD', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'sit', 'well', 'only', '7', 'eight', '34', 'get', 'stretch', 'legs', '34', 'breaks.I', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'compliant', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'bit', 'more', 'case-study', 'approach', 'showing', 'someone', 'untreated', 'ADHD', 'how', 'life', 'could', 'change', 'medication', 'coaching', 'tidbits', 'info', 'helped.I', 'think', 'essential', 'watch', 'have', 'loved', 'one', 'ADHD', 'ADD', 'extremely', 'hard', 'explain', 'what', 'don', 't', 'know', 'what', 'be', 'normal', 'one', 'man', 'interviewed', 'street', 'said', 'when', 'child', 'doctor', 'read', 'off', 'symptoms', 'ADHD', 'had', 'ask', '34', 'mean', 'not', 'normal', '34', 'great', 'information', 'parents', 'ADD/ADHD', 'child', 'adult', 'disorder', 'Watching', 'suffer', 'condition', 'will', 'darn', 'break', 'heart', 'when', 'little', 'pieces', 'life', 'never', 'could', 'figure', 'out', 'suddenly', 'have', 'explanation']",N/A

It was comforting hearing the truth about ADHD from Doctors and Health Professional experts on this brain wiring issue.I loved how they answered all the questions around ADHD/ADD, in that several people answered on the same questions. I was very interested in this film the entire time because it was very informative and I am now more knowledgeable on this  than I was and I now have more hope in knowing how to help my 7-yr. old child whom I think struggles because of having possible ADD.Thank you for making this very informative film. I cried at parts because they described me so well as a person with ADD, and it was very emotional for me, seeing I'm ok and that I'm not alone in this brain issue.
