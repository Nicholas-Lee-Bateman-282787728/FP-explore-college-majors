Carson helped launch virtually every important standup until he retired - and there has been no venue to replace him.  This DVD set has all the greats we are still enjoying - Seinfeld, George Carlin, Steven Wright, Gary Shandling - and many of the greats that are gone, including Rodney Dangerfield. It is really interesting to see them with 70's suits and hair at the very beginning of their careers.

Carson gave so many comedians of our generation and up until today their start that it will surprise you who all's here.  It's worth the price for the memories and because comedy is also subjective you'll like some, you'll love others and a few won't be your cup of tea.  That's what a line up like this is all about.

George Carlin, for example, bombed.  He was a funny comic in his early years, but not here.  I can't imagine why this particular Tonight Show appearance was included.  Drew Carrey is another bomb, but then I never thought he was very funny.My favorites in this selection are Rodney Dangerfield, Gallagher, Rita Rudner, and Brett Butler.
