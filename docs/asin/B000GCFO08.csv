Naturally being a huge fan of the even more terrifying games,my review may seem biased.However I truely don't understand why Roger Ebert gave such a terrible review for this movie,other than perhaps he has something against video games.While the conclusion of the plot can be a bit confusing (they made the mistake of trying to fill in the connection on SH 1&3 and then adding hollywood's take on the game) there is still much for both horror fans and SH fans to enjoy.The effects alone should have given this a thumbs up (Ebert barely gave any credit to this except to say that it was like a college art film) One of the greatest moments was when we encounter the first creature of Silent Hill.When the face was shown and that shrill was made,I truely got scared just from the anticipation alone.Then shorlty thereafter,when the ""grey children"" burn up,we get a dark comedy moment of Rose waking up to Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.While the acting was average(at least for the male roles)Cybiland Rose both did a good job portraying the horror that would be felt if being immersed in such a sadistic,evil dimension.Also all SH fans will be happy to see their favorite demons make appearances in this movie adaptation.Included are patients roaches,Pyramid Head,and my personal twisted favorite,the nurses.Call me strange,but I actually find them kind of sexy.The different music from various SH games are this movie's soundtrack.With the most notable being SH3's opening title as the movies end credits.Personaly I think there will be alot more people that like this movie than hate it.The only reason that I give it a four star instead of a 5,is because 1.)I would have liked the storyline to be completely from an actual game rather than hollywood changing certain aspects 2.)the plot does kind of lose you,which is because of the first problem and 3.)more demons and special effects rather than the whole ""witch!witch!"" harping done in the final 45 minutes of the movie.Still,the good outweighs the bad.SH and occult gore fans will enjoy this one.Roger Ebert is just a pompous,self-absorbed dinosouar who needs to retire.",4,Send Pyramid Head after Roger Ebert!!,1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,2179,"['most', 'part', 'think', 'was', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'Naturally', 'being', 'huge', 'fan', 'even', 'more', 'terrifying', 'games', 'review', 'may', 'seem', 'biased.However', 'truely', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'gave', 'terrible', 'review', 'movie', 'other', 'perhaps', 'something', 'video', 'conclusion', 'plot', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'confusing', 'made', 'mistake', 'trying', 'fill', 'connection', 'SH', '1', '3', 'then', 'adding', 'hollywood', 'take', 'game', 'still', 'much', 'horror', 'fans', 'SH', 'fans', 'enjoy.The', 'effects', 'alone', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'thumbs', 'up', 'Ebert', 'barely', 'gave', 'credit', 'say', 'was', 'college', 'art', 'film', 'One', 'greatest', 'moments', 'was', 'when', 'encounter', 'first', 'creature', 'Silent', 'Hill.When', 'face', 'was', 'shown', 'shrill', 'was', 'made', 'truely', 'got', 'scared', 'just', 'anticipation', 'alone.Then', 'shorlty', 'thereafter', 'when', 'grey', 'children', 'burn', 'up', 'get', 'dark', 'comedy', 'moment', 'Rose', 'waking', 'up', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Ring', 'Fire.While', 'acting', 'was', 'average', 'least', 'male', 'roles', 'Cybiland', 'Rose', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'portraying', 'horror', 'would', 'be', 'felt', 'being', 'immersed', 'such', 'sadistic', 'evil', 'dimension.Also', 'SH', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'favorite', 'demons', 'make', 'appearances', 'movie', 'adaptation.Included', 'are', 'patients', 'roaches', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'personal', 'twisted', 'favorite', 'nurses.Call', 'strange', 'actually', 'find', 'kind', 'sexy.The', 'different', 'music', 'various', 'SH', 'games', 'are', 'movie', 'most', 'notable', 'being', 'SH3', 'opening', 'title', 'movies', 'end', 'credits.Personaly', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'alot', 'more', 'people', 'movie', 'hate', 'it.The', 'only', 'reason', 'give', 'four', 'star', 'instead', '5', '1', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'storyline', 'be', 'completely', 'actual', 'game', 'rather', 'hollywood', 'changing', 'certain', 'aspects', '2', 'plot', 'kind', 'lose', 'first', 'problem', '3', 'more', 'demons', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'whole', 'witch', 'witch', 'harping', 'done', 'final', '45', 'minutes', 'movie.Still', 'good', 'bad.SH', 'occult', 'gore', 'fans', 'will', 'enjoy', 'one.Roger', 'Ebert', 'just', 'pompous', 'self-absorbed', 'dinosouar', 'who', 'retire']",N/A

The people at Konami should use this as an example to what their next gen game should look like.  Now after watching the PS3 trailer I really wanted to purchase this movie despite what others have said about the picture quality.  The movie is far from award worthy but it does really utilize the Blu-ray.  At least as far as picture.  I found the movie looked really good with a crisp picture and superb resolution.  Despite what some people have said I can only think they have less than a 1080p t.v.  Overall the movie is hardly scary and doesn't seem to have anything redeming.  I wanted to have something pull me in.  Whether it was a character's performance on the visuals.  Nothing grabbed me.  Even with some horror movies that aren't very good you still get a little comedy.  Not here.

1001580,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B000GCFO08,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 3]","Silent Hill has never been one of my favorite video games due to the franchise's clumsy controls, clunky combat, and aggravating puzzles and riddles (I hate riddles dammit!). But this movie is good, really good to be exact. Which is no surprise considering that one of the film studios: Davis Films; helped make the excellent Resident Evil films. This film is a mix of stylish, morbid, gory, and disturbing horror that is wonderfully pieced together and retains the essence of the games.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A nine-year-old girl named Sharon is having strange dreams and sleep walking while speaking of an old ghost town in West Virginia called Silent Hill, which in the 1970's had nearly the entire population of the town burned due to a coal fire and is now referred to as ""The Tainted Town"". Her mother Rose takes her to the town to figure out why she is having these dreams, and on the way there they get into a car accident. When Rose wakes up, Sharon is missing and she goes to search for her in Silent Hill. Then many strange things begin occurring, and she slowly discovers the horrible secrets the town's hellish history contains along with her daughter's history, while trying to evade the many horrific abominations of creatures the games are known for like Pyramid Head.STORYLINE: SCORE- 8.75 OUT OF 10- The story could use a little work, some parts of the story are things I've already seen in other horror flicks, but other parts are not which makes most of it good and more interesting than many horror movies.GORE FACTOR: SCORE- 9.25 OUT OF 10- This film can be downright disgusting when it comes to gore factor. Arterial spray, skin being ripped off, people being burned to death, and more.DISTURBING FACTOR: SCORE- 9.5 OUT OF 10- The creature designs are macabre, gross, and scary. The way the town and all of its horrible contents have been designed wonderfully and really match the eerie feel you get if you play the games, because you're afraid of what will come for you next.MUSIC: SCORE- 9.5 OUT OF 10- The people who made this movie must really love the games considering they got the guy who does the amazing music for the games to do the music for this movie and it fits to near perfection.ENTERTAINMENT: SCORE- 9.5 OUT OF 10- This movie is highly entertaining and will really keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting to know what comes next as the story is very nicely conveyed. Gore factor is wonderful, creature designs are true to the games along with the town's design, and great music really sums up this horror movie classic.OVERALL: SCORE- 9.5 OUT OF 10- If you like the games you'll probably love the movie, if you like horror movies in general, you will like this movie. What makes this horror movie all the more better, is the fact it feels much fresher than many horror movies.

1001581,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000GCFO08,Adam Craig,"[6, 7]","It takes a lot for a video game to scare, shock, or disgust me.  The only two games that immediately come to mind are Resident Evil and Silent Hill.  These games are the only ones that I can remember actually being scared to play when I was alone.  I think I was about 12 when the first versions of these games came out, and all of my gaming systems were in the basement.  Therefore, whenever I felt like playing, I had to go all by myself down into the basement to plunge myself into the terrifying worlds that these games transport you to.  However, other than being frightening, Resident Evil and Silent Hill had very little in common as far as the focus of the game itself.  While Resident Evil was a ""zombie game,"" Silent Hill was much more atmospheric and creepy, with less violence in general.  When the Resident Evil movie came out, I was very excited.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the resulting film.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but they took way too many liberties with the storyline, and the film turned into more a creature flick than a zombie movie.  Resident Evil was one of the first movies to be based upon a game, and its failure to materialize really set the standard for future movie to be based on games.  I mean, just think of the video game movies of the past.  You've got Mortal Kombat (not horrible), Doom (horrible), Street Fighter (ridiculously bad), Final Fantasy (waste of money), Tomb Raider (at least it had Angelina Jolie), Super Mario Bros. (I don't wanna talk about it), Bloodrayne, House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and the list goes on...  To say that video game movies have a bad reputation is a serious understatement.All that said, for some reason, I was really excited to see Silent Hill.  Let's be honest here.  I wanted to like this movie.  No, no, I wanted to love this movie.  It had a great director (Christophe Gans) and a great screenwriter (Roger Avary) and the source material was actually better than most video games, so why wouldn't it be a good movie, right?  Those were all the ideas I had in my head when walking into the theater.  And when I want to like a movie, I find something to like about it, no matter how awful it might be.  To be frank, Silent Hill was one of the absolute weirdest movie going experiences that I have ever had.  I am completely torn on this movie.  As a video game adaptation, strictly, this is by far the best that has ever been released.  This movie is true to the game in every aspect.  Whether it is the scenery, characters, dialog, music, or camera angles, the film is basically like watching someone else playing the video game.  Granted, to write a screenplay you have to create some sort of story to give it some meaning, so the revolving story around the events that are taking place is mostly created by the screenwriter, but it is still an OK storyline, even though it strays from the games (at least the ones that I have played) in a few ways.  However, as a movie, Silent Hill just doesn't really work.  It seems jumbled, the dialog can be extremely hokey at a bunch of moments, and it does drag at some points.  For a lot of viewers, I'm sure, the movie will seem like a bunch of random, nightmarish segments all just thrown together like an episode of Saturday Night Live....but from Hell.  However, for those of us who have played the games, there is a much higher level of appreciation that is attainable here.Rose and Christopher's adopted daughter, Sharon, has a sleepwalking problem, and during her ""episodes,"" she is constantly talking about Silent Hill, a town in West Virginia.  After a particularly intense episode, Rose decides that she needs to take Sharon to Silent Hill and get all this figured out.  Rose and Sharon head off to town while Christopher is left alone at home, fuming over everything that has been going on.  They eventually get to the abandoned town (mine fires burning underneath caused massive deaths) and a car crash separates mother from daughter, and from there the movie devolves into an insane nightmare with some images the likes of which have never even been seen by these eyes.  There are some creatures in this film that the images will stick with the viewers for a long time to come.  Pyramid Head is an amazing, unfortunately underutilized demon that plays a frustratingly small role in the film.  When he does appear, however, he does not disappoint.  The dead man in the bathroom stall (I don't know a specific name) is a truly disturbing image.  As he crawls along the bathroom floor, with his black tongue flicking out, and his legs tied all the way back above his head by barb wire, I was very uncomfortable.  Once again, however, he is only in the movie for that one scene, and not much really happens other than we get to see him, and then Rose runs away.  The nurse demons are in the film as well, and their scene easily provides the most tension-based part of the film, as Rose must navigate through their twitching, evil bodies without letting them sense that she is there.  All these random encounters with demons represent about ? of the movie.  As the last half hour approaches, the viewer is given the classic flashback sequence to explain what is going on.  And while I feel the explanation is unnecessary, I do understand why Roger Avary decided to add it to the film.  If there was no explanation, the chances of anyone liking this film who hadn't played the game would be decreased to zero.  Once the flashback is over, the climactic sequence does not disappoint in any way.  While most of the gore is CG, it is over-the-top enough to where I didn't really care.  And there are a couple of really disturbing moments (just think about a little girl dancing and skipping around in a shower of blood from one of her victims).After the credits started rolling, I decided that I didn't like Silent Hill.  It wasn't really a movie, in a lot of ways, as I said earlier.  And most of the other people in the Gateway theater didn't really like it either (there was a lot of laughing and ridiculing going on).  As the night wore on, though, and I talked about the movie a little more with the people I saw it with (who both thought it wasn't bad), I realized that I was looking at the movie in the wrong way.  I can't ""rate"" this movie based on how good of a film it was, I need to judge it based on the source material and how it applied the plot of a simple video game as the basis for a 2 hour movie.  Like I said, as a video game adaptation, this movie blows all other out of the water in every way.  Quality, loyalty, and visuals are all out of this world and directly comparable to the game.  Therefore, I have now decided that I did like Silent Hill, and while most people who see it probably won't enjoy it at all, it pretty much did what I expected it to do, which was disturb me.  It isn't a ""scary"" movie really at all.  I can't think of many moments when I was genuinely scared, but I can think of plenty of moments when I was staring at the screen saying, ""Oh dear Lord, no.""  And if a movie can make me do that, it has definitely succeeded.",3,Best video game adaptation to date,1145664000,"04 22, 2006",2006,7120,"['lot', 'video', 'game', 'scare', 'shock', 'disgust', 'only',

For the most part it followed the first game well. There are some different elements but it doesn't to me make much of a difference. Even if you have never played or heard of the game Silent Hill I think you will love this movie. This movie is very freaky and morbid in a lot of ways. There is some very disturbing stuff in this film. One thing I liked a lot about this movie was the over all look of the film. It mached the game perfectly. Also the creatures were just as I remembered them from the game sick and twisted.But what I liked most about the movie was how it used the same music that was in the game.

When we got out of the house we'd seen the movie at, they were all staring at each other and asking the same question: ""what the f*ck was that all about!?"" while I was still thinking whether I liked it or not, and remembering the first game. I was probably 12-13 when the first of the series came out, and just like 99% of the people who played it, I LOVED it. I feel like one of the reviewers before me, who said he 'wanted' to like the movie.I think this movie has a lot to do with the first game, and part of the second one, unlike most videogame-based movies, which usually come up with completely different bases. I don't wanna spoil the fun by saying which enemies or 'bad guys' they've included, I'm just gonna say they're AWESOME and perfectly adapted. The special effects are great, but in the 2000's that's nothing out of the ordinary. The storyline has the same concept as that of the first game, with several differences that were made for this adaptation.I don't wanna say much more to not spoil the fun, but my point here is: if you've played Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2, you'll like, or even love the movie. If you haven't, you'll be confused and will probably hate it.About the rating, as the movie it is, I give it 3 stars.

Thus from what I've seen, the trailers and reading summeries and all, I think that this movie does have the main character correct...the main character being Silent Hill, the city/the hell.  Yes it doesn't have Hary Mason, though it does have close to the same storyline as the first game...from what I've observed so far, it also takes a bit of the other two games (I wont go so far as adding the fourth game as I really didn't like it myself, but that's just me).  Silent Hill is the main character, and the hell that it works upon those who come into its lair is the prize for the movie watcher.  Silent Hill is filled with shadows, blood, and ancient mysteries better left hidden as the cliche goes.  Silent Hill is what you come to see the movie for, Silent Hill is what you play the game for, at least for me.  One character comes and another one goes, but the darkness that is SH is what brings me back to the game.  I am not myself so worried about having every specific character from the game, I am just hoping and praying (a strange thing to be doing toward SH anyway) that the producers/the writers/the directors/and the actors compliment the TOWN and the TOWN in turn complimenting them.  I hope and pray, again I say, that this will not be a repeat of the first House of the Dead (a really, aweful, foolish movie).

So this is not a comparison of how the movie stacks up against the games. I don't care about that.The story makes a lot of sense to me, and I genuinely feel for (most) of the characters. Rose's reactions are very believable when confronted by the nightmares, as are the cop Cybil Bennett's. Cybil is also one of the coolest people I have ever seen in a movie, and if I ever end up in a life-threatening situation, I want someone just like her with me. Awesome character. And I understood why Alessa did what she did, and part of me even agreed with her need for revenge. The first time I watched it, the whole movie was absolutely terrifying--subsequent viewings have cooled the reactions somewhat, but there are still some scenes that scare me every time. The first monster Cybil and Rose encounter...Colin...but the scariest scenes (and the ones I watch the movie for) are the ones with Pyramid Head and the broken nurses.

1001588,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,B000GCFO08,Anton Ilinski,"[5, 8]","When I was watching ""Silent Hill"" in theater I wished sometimes I could rewind and watch certain scene again for it was rather hard to understand from the first time. Generally the film left a good impression but I wasn't thinking of it as of some kind of a masterpiece. But the next day I felt an urge to watch ""Silent Hill"" again. I have to say here that the last (and only) time I watched some movie in theater twice was when I decided to see ""Die Hard"" one more time in the beginning of 90s when it was one of the first big American films to hit our post-Soviet screens.So I watched ""SH"" again and liked it much more as well as understood better. The next day my brother said he's going to the cinema to see ""SH"". I said I'd go with him. So I watched it for the third time in a row. I guess I understood everything I had doubts about although some mist still remains. And now I can only say ""SH"" is one of the best films I've seen in life and I mean not just within a horror genre.First I thought it was some kind of a ""Hellraiser + The Cell + Dark Water + Nightbreed + In the Mouth of Madness"" mix, but then I realized it's quite unique in its style, manner and pacing. It's impossible to tell what ""SH"" is about because it has lots of meanings, lots of subplots which you can interpret whatever you like, and first you have to think a bit just to interpret it somehow. Among all recent horror films I immensely liked ""The Descent"" for example and that movie was pretty simple - an understandable story, no hidden agendas. But here you are given enough food for thought for I don't know how much time. ""SH"" is good for the second and the third and many more viewings because everytime you watch it you'll find something new and discover previously unnoticed layers.Visually ""SH"" is just beautiful. It's sinister, apocalyptic and picturesque like paintings of Goya and Bosch. And yet it's so enchanting. ""Silent Hill"" world is very tactile and substantial I can't remember any other movie that would be so real. You can really sense this town, smell the coal-burning, feel ashes on your hair, feel the darkness coming with every fibre of your skin. And its dismal and tenebrous mechanical inferno with all the hellish creatures just exists right here - around you.There are many different things to think about on ""Silent Hill"": it has a theme of revenge and justice. It's about personal hell and hell in a general meaning. It's even metaphorical about alienation when members of a family live close to each other and still lose connection, they almost literally don't notice the person next to them.It's even a bit embarrassing that ""Silent Hill"" is made out of a video game - it's so good it should've been separate, individual work. But now it's obvious to me a good film can be shot based on a game, after a deadborn ""Doom"" and abysmal ""House of the Dead"".I'm anxiously waiting for the DVD to be released, I'm sure I'm going to watch it again and again.

1001592,A1QG4TLIYZRL7L,B000GCFO08,"Arthur Blenheim ""arthurblenheim""","[0, 3]","I played all of the Silent Hill games.  I used to say that proudly.  This movie is faithful to the videogame's original plot: it's a convoluted mess.  The movie looks fantastic, but I have no idea what it means.  Since it so faithfully recreates that element from the game, the fault is in the game, but why make a bad movie?  Because people like a videogame?  At least I assumed the game had a plot, as I'm still not sure what that is.  The main reasons I played the games were that the games were more about creepy noises.  I confess: it never made sense and neither does this movie.  The interesting part of the game was the 3-D free-roaming environment with monsters lurking around.  The games were good because they were 3-D and had a lot of odd linear perspective shots which were replicated for the movie.As much as I like the game's competition, Resident Evil has 2-dimensional backdrops which are semi-annoying, and it was cliche'd from the stories of George Romero's Night of the Living Dead trilogy.  However, the plot was at least more coherent than the muck of Silent Hill: I always knew that.  The reason for playing the Silent Hill games was not because it made sense, but because it has an original story and theme with a fantasy world like a David Lynch film, or like Terry Gilliam's Brazil, and particularly like David Cronenberg's older films, but even those films had some relevance.Perhaps Silent Hill was not supposed to have any meaning, but only be a fantasy of horrors with imaginative visuals and aurals to go with its gameplay.  Like Roger Ebert described, I wish the movie had not given me so much plot detail and story explanations because doing so gummed up the sensations of its mood.  The more it explained things, the less sense it made.  Silent Hill was meant as a purely subjective experience for videogame industry consumers of the time.  I confess that I never understood what the story meant when I played the games: I knew there was a cult organization, I knew there were characters, I knew there were horrors about ghosts and goblins, but I only accepted the creedence of these things at face value.  The movie should not have spent so much time with the secondary spouse character, and I don't remember that in the game or the connection with the real world either.  It could've just been a movie with a haunted house setting and interesting characters.Think about it if you care: the game initially started on Sony's first Playstation, and Sony was emphasizing 3-dimensional graphics, although the memory of its console was not so capable.  It was trying to compete with Nintendo who always gave videogame consumers stuffed-plush animals as protagonists.  Sony in making games with adult content, especially the first Silent Hill game, was a declaration of revolution in an industry of stuffed animals; THAT FACT GAVE SILENT HILL A LOT OF WEIGHT IN ITS IMPORTANCE AS A SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE.  Since the release of the first Silent Hill game ten years ago, Sony has outdone Nintendo in the videogame industry.  Sony won; this movie isn't needed.  Silent Hill was an extremely playable game even without a story coherence, and one with a lot of adult situational blood and violence, more as in paintings, and that was what it was worth.  The game was very playable because it offered a whole city, or town, with a completely free-roaming 3-dimensional environment, which also added greatly to the game.  But, contrary to the belief that this game would've made a great movie, I insist not.  Everyone who said so should admit to it as a mistake.

1001596,A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B000GCFO08,"Axel Law ""The Happy Seizure Kid""","[3, 4]","*  Based on the game series by Konami*  Written by Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction)*  Directed by Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf)It's been a while since I've written my last review, and despite it being somewhat close to Silent Hill's original theatrical release date, I feel it is high time that I write a review to offset some of the rather mixed reviews I've read.  While it certainly became a hit at the box office, critics have been mixed about this horror film, based on the cult game series from Konami, and even fans have started to spread themselves thin over what to make of it.  I was no different when I heard that Christophe Gans was directing, in which I wasn't all too fond of ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" to begin with, and that there were some story points that were changed; however, I still wanted to give the film its chance and in the end, I'm really glad I did.  I would go so far to say that this is the best film adaptation of a video game ever.  Seriously, when has a video game based film been THIS good?The story is changed somewhat; Instead of Harry Mason, we have Rose (Radha Mitchell), married to Christopher (the totally awesome Sean Bean), who adopt a child named Sharon (Cheryl from the Silent Hill video game).  Sharon keeps having bad dreams about Silent Hill, a town with a terrible history that has been locked away for quite some time.  Despite rumors and historical accounts, Rose decides to take her there against Chris's wishes to figure out why she's having nightmares. After an accident, Rose is knocked unconscious, only to awaken in the ash-falling Silent Hill and without Sharon.  Along the way she runs into Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), Dahlia Gillespie (Deborah K. Unger), and Christabella (Dahlia's sister, played by the deliciously evil Alice Krige), among others.  She also is led to many areas that have been a part of Alessa's suffering, and she encounters crazy monsters including the all-too-scary Pyramid Head lifted from Silent Hill 2 for the Playstation 2 (my favorite Silent Hill game).  We are given Alessa's horrible past, being made fun of for her powers (""Witch!"") and eventually burned in a sort of witch trial; This backfires, however, sending the followers of Christabella into a state of limbo in Silent Hill, and the town has gone awry with hellish monsters lurking about at random as the result of Alessa's hatred.  Alessa had drawn Rose there, along with the light side of Alessa's soul (Sharon), in order to exact revenge upon the misguided cult worshippers.  Meanwhile, Christopher fears that something has gone wrong and sets out to discover where Rose and Sharon are, despite butting heads with a detective (Kim Coates), who has a connection to Silent Hill's past...The movie is graphic in its depiction of Silent Hill, basically a world of Hell on Earth.  They went through the trouble of making it LOOK like the games.  I commend the production designer and the art directors for successfully making this transition from video game into filmmaking.  Christophe Gans has strategically placed the cameras to make it seem as though we are playing the game through odd but creepy angles.  We view some of the most terrifying images in horror film history such as when Cybil is mercilessly beaten to hell and burned alive, or when the Pyramid Head rips the clothes clean off a cult follower (Tanya Allen) and slices her skin clean off!  And if that doesn't scar you for life, then the retribution scene (which plays almost like if Christ were pissed off, he'd kick our collective tails) with barbed wire ripping through flesh and bone surely will.I appreciated some of the story shifting, like Dahlia no longer being the villain (in the game, she led the cult to resurrect the demon Samael), and the mythology of the cult has even changed; They're misguided Christians who yearn to cleanse the world of evil, only to have created their own Purgatory in Silent Hill, and refuse to accept fault or redemption for their sins.  They are given the chance, and pay for it.The ending have left many disappointed, but it left it wide open for a sequel.  Plus the fact that each Silent Hill game has a sad ending of sorts, even the best ones.  All the actors turn in excellent performances, especially Laurie Holden and Alice Krige, and I may have found a new hero in Christophe Gans.  He has directed a film so painstakingly similar to the Silent Hill game without giving away too much or shying away from the origins of the story (the music score by Akira Yukumoura is even from the games, particularly 2 and 3!).  He also added little touches like the patient demon from Silent Hill 2, the nurse from the first game, and even getting the street names right (the last names of several horror authors).  This is a beautiful yet almost unbearably creepy film, and I totally commend the filmmakers for FINALLY creating a video game based film worth talking about.",5,"At last, a GOOD video game movie!

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","I have played the original Silent Hill for the Playstation One, and let me tell you, the main story of this movie is almost exactly the same as the video game! I'm not kidding- I knew exactly what was going to happen because the stories were so much alike that a part of me was actually worried that I might be wasting my time watching the movie when I could be playing the game.As you've probably heard, the video game Silent Hill was extremely groundbreaking in the year 1999 because the game was SO scary and SO different compared to every other game that was on the market at the time. Now, with that in mind, this movie failed to live up to the intense atmosphere of the video game.However, it doesn't matter, because the movie did a respectable job at scaring me, and you know, having the main character be a woman who has to find her daughter instead of a father who has to find his daughter (like the video game) may have actually been a better decision. If you've played the game, you'd know that Harry Mason was a REALLY bad voice actor. The woman who plays the mother in the film is really good.Also, considering this movie came out years after the video game it's based on, technology has improved which means you are guaranteed to see better visual effects in the movie than you would in 1999 playing the game. Silent Hill the game was more about remaining quiet and building an atmosphere, whereas the movie has some really unusual effects such as blood rising off the floor and walls and increasing the overall amount of action.The similarities between the movie and the game don't stop there- remember when you had to run around looking for your daughter in the beginning of the game? It's in the movie. Remember that snowy town with buildings all around it, and only a human police officer around? It's in the movie. Remember finding a note from your daughter that she's at the school? It's in the movie. A lot of things from the game are in the movie.Another complaint people have with this movie is that the story doesn't make sense. That was a popular complaint with the video game too. I don't like it when horror movies make sense, to be honest. I can't feel scared when the story begins making total sense. Silent Hill leaves you wondering what's going on. You'll know what's going on. The movie just takes a weird direction later on that may end up confusing you.Really good movie worth watching, even if you've played the video game a million times like me.",5,awesome,1178409600,"05 6, 2007",2007,2482,"['have', 'played', 'original', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Playstation', 'One', 'let', 'tell', 'main', 'story', 'movie', 'almost', 'exactly', 'same', 'video', 'game', ""'m"", 'not', 'kidding-', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'stories', 'were', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'was', 'actually', 'worried', 'might', 'be', 'wasting', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'when', 'could', 'be', 'playing', 'game.As', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'heard', 'video', 'game', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'extremely', 'groundbreaking', 'year', '1999', 'game', 'was', 'SO', 'scary', 'SO', 'different', 'compared', 'other', 'game', 'was', 'market', 'time', 'Now', 'mind', 'movie', 'failed', 'live', 'up', 'intense', 'atmosphere', 'video', 'game.However', ""n't"", 'matter', 'movie', 'did', 'respectable', 'job', 'scaring', 'know', 'having', 'main', 'character', 'be', 'woman', 'who', 'find', 'daughter', 'instead', 'father', 'who', 'find', 'daughter', 'video', 'game', 'may', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'better', 'decision', ""'ve"", 'played', 'game', ""'d"", 'know', 'Harry', 'Mason', 'was', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'voice', 'actor', 'woman', 'who', 'mother', 'film', 'really', 'good.Also', 'considering', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'years', 'video', 'game', 'based', 'technology', 'improved', 'are', 'guaranteed', 'see', 'better', 'visual', 'effects', 'movie', 'would', '1999', 'playing', 'game', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'game', 'was', 'more', 'remaining', 'quiet', 'building', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'really', 'unusual', 'effects', 'such', 'blood', 'rising', 'off', 'floor', 'walls', 'increasing', 'overall', 'amount', 'action.The', 'similarities', 'movie', 'game', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'there-', 'remember', 'when', 'had', 'run', 'around', 'looking', 'daughter', 'beginning', 'game', 'movie', 'Remember', 'snowy', 'town', 'buildings', 'only', 'human', 'police', 'officer', 'movie', 'Remember', 'finding', 'note', 'daughter', 'school', 'movie', 'lot', 'things', 'game', 'are', 'movie.Another', 'complaint', 'people', 'have', 'movie', 'story', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'was', 'popular', 'complaint', 'video', 'game', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'when', 'horror', 'movies', 'make', 'sense', 'be', 'honest', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'scared', 'when', 'story', 'making', 'total', 'sense', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'wondering', 'what', 'going', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'movie', 'just', 'weird', 'direction', 'later', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'confusing', 'you.Really', 'good', 'movie', 'watching', 'even', ""'ve"", 'played', 'video', 'game', 'million', 'times']",N/A

Who are you to judge?  No one can judge ""angels.""  We are judged according to our deeds.  Sounds like a religious movie.  On the contrary, that huge cathedral in Silent Hill, West Virginia, is used to burn sacrifices; a pagan symbol is atop the tower.Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" was used as a prelude to show how this pagan cult had taken over the ghost town.  It is symbolic of good verses evil.  Nurse Betty was there in her red sweater and red shoes (no, it's not 'The Wizard of Oz,' but symbolism and falsehoods where no one is as he appears is at the forefront in this creepy-crawly film).  It takes faith to restore innocence and purity.  Faith is the only truth.  Perhaps your faith will protect you, perhaps not?What's your definition of justice?  You didn't tell me everything.  I double-dare the viewer to learn the truth.  Don't believe their lies -- what they had created mushroomed into an inferno.  Sharon had ""seen"" the town and school in her tortured dreams and drew colored pictures of them.  On one of her sleep walks, we see a huge lighted cross of fire at a waterfall.  Rose, her adopted mother, couldn't take any more and drove her Jeep to take the child to the scene of these weird dreams.  There, a coal fire burned underground and ashes float like snow.  She told her ""It's going to be just you and me"" but when she thought all was hopeless, she wept from desperation.  They found a devil's playground where the ghost women were ""desperate housewives"" right out of 'Pajama Game.'Lonely and scared in this deserted place, they found a bus stop sign on which Neely Avenue took them to the orphanage and school.  Certain forms you just can't control, like the living dead.  This dream must end.  Everything (nothing) will be alright ever again.  Do you know what you've done.  They were fanatics and what they did was terrible, unethical.  She was emotionally tortured by the ""human"" vermin where they found a demon in the ""core"" of darkness.  This is crazy -- you who cast the first stone can take refuge in the church, where unbelievers are thrown into the lake of fire for their misdeeds.  A runaway elevator takes Rose into the bowels of fire, a hell on earth, beneath the church.  Deliver me from the evil demons who are deceivers and tell lies.  This can't go any farther.  All we ask for is satisfaction; only the innocents will survive.  The guilty will perish in ""a ring of fire.""Now, we must pray as they cast out evil with sacrifices, as in the pagan days in the Mayan mountains.  Guilt will not deny you.  I need to do this, Rose felt; she wants vengeance.  Your reward is the truth, but you'll never be the same.  Hurt, she yells, ""Get off my back.""  They find things tarnished and are too damaged to see anything is alright, as nothing will ever be the same, even in paradise.  This scary episode is based on a video game.

1001607,AVOCNUFOXUCA6,B000GCFO08,Brian A. Schar,"[1, 1]","""Silent Hill"" is a technical masterpiece, particularly when it comes to production design.  A lot of people spent a lot of time making this movie look good.  The cinematography was interesting and attractive.  And the actors could act, a welcome change from most movies of this genre.  The little girl was very good and has a decent career ahead of her.I also have to give ""Silent Hill"" points for doing two things that horror movies often don't do.  First, it tells us the names of the characters early on, so we're not discovering an hour into the movie what the main character's name is.  Second, we actually get to Silent Hill within 13 minutes of the movie starting; it doesn't screw around at the beginning waiting to get started.However, this movie only gets three stars because of story/plot issues and editing.  Frankly, there isn't much story at all, just some excuses for pretty production design.  Things happen simply because they're in the script.  For example, Mom takes her sleep-disordered little girl to the creepy town in her nightmares rather than to the doctor.  And she resists arrest to do it.  I didn't buy it.  The ending comes 20-30 minutes later than it should, and leaves you wondering what the point of the whole movie was.Nevertheless, if you enjoy horror movies, you can do a lot worse.

1001608,A3HLRR2FL9E5DP,B000GCFO08,Brian,"[5, 5]","First off, I should probably mention that I possessed absolutely no prior knowledge of the ""Silent Hill"" video games before sitting through this particular movie. Having said that, I must also point out that I followed the flow of the story perfectly from start to finish. So many had previously warned me that Director Christophe Gans had no feel for the narrative and that no portion of this overall amazing motion picture made any logical sense. If, however, like me, one is prone to utilizing their brain cells throughout certain cinematic fare like ""Silent Hill,"" these claims do not hold true.Radha Mitchell assumes the starring role of a young mother who drives her daughter, Sharon, to the creepy town of Silent Hill to find answers behind the mysterious sleepwalking ailment she's been afflicted with. A violent crash precipitates Sharon's abrupt disappearance and leaves Rose, the mother, in dire need of tracking her down and ensuring her safety. She soon discovers that Silent Hill is not what it seems. A perpetual fog of smoldering ash envelops her surroundings, while freakishly twisted mutations straight out of H.P. Lovecraft's worst nightmare threaten and mill around every corner. We, the viewers, soon learn of a mass tragedy that befell the local citizenry, forcing those who were left in its wake to endure a ceaseless purgatory inside the town church. Evil, unknown to Rose and her daughter, has secretly summoned them to the borders of this formerly thriving town so that it may use their oblivious presence to infiltrate the forbidden barrier of the church and access these people who somehow escaped its cruel punishment.I was thoroughly enraptured by every last reel of this production. Gans elicits a visual style that is both grotesque and undeniably beautiful. An unrelenting sense of dread resonates throughout the entire film. And when the much-debated ending rolls around, one finds that specific dread has not yet abated.Yes, the door is left open for a second installment. But, this represents one instance where I actually find myself welcoming that notion with open arms. ""Silent Hill"" left me hungry for more, much more, and I can only hope that any sequel we do eventually get will carry on the rare breed of quality that this film bleeds in abundance. It may not be for everybody, in all honesty.

When I first saw it, I figured most of it was CGI, but then I watched the making -of featurettes and was startled to find that many of the creatures were actually in costume.  You don't see too much of that these days.  The atmosphere of Silent Hill was perfectly captured in the gloomy sky, falling ashes and decrepit buildings.Where I got hung up was the plot.  I've never played the Silent Hill game series, so I don't know if that would help me or not, but at the end I literally just sat there and asked myself: ""What just happened here?"" And found I had absolutely no idea.  Here are just  a few questions that were raised in my mind: Are all the residents of Silent Hill dead (like, is that why Rose says they're ""already damned?"") and just think they're some sort of super-cult that survived the apocalypse?  Is Alessa dead, and if she is, how did she give birth -- and why at the particular time she did, YEARS after she was burned, from the timeline I could gather? Is Sharon more of a ""spirit-child,"" an entity, or some sort of copy, of her ""mother?"" Who is the creepy demon child and why does she look like Sharon? What's up with the barbed wire in Alessa's ""revenge"" sequence? Where did all the weird creatures come from and what do they have to do with anything, other than scaring the principal actors? Do Sharon and Rose die at the end of the movie?  What's Dahlia supposed to do, all alone back at Silent Hill?

I guess it's all about the visuals & Silent Hill did everything very well in that department! this movie at least tried, something Doom, Wrong Turn, I Know What You Did Last Summers, Screams & especially House of a Thousand Corpses didn't do. so yah, it's a decent horror film, something I would never watch again cause it's just not that interesting. but one viewing, is ok. I'd say rent it if you love horror films or if you got nothing better to rent. it's just not really my kinda film, I like Thrillers way better cause I find them scary! I find they tend to have a better plot & I love it when the build it up so we're interested to see what's going to happen from one scene to the next, like Signs. this film was kinda like that but it's just dumb. horror films I find tend to focus too much on gore & not enough actually being scary. so I tend to stay away from them cause it's just disgusting, we don't need to see people's limbs getting hacked off & this film does have it's fair share of gore but it didn't bother me too much. it's plot that's stupid. so if u don't mind a confusing midly entertaining movie based on a video game, & I have to say, it's on of the better movies based on a video game, I mean, compare it to Tomb Raider which both of them were ok or more fitting a comparison, Doom, which was an absolute disaster, but compared to any other film, it'd be toward the end of my list of films to watch.",3,it has it's highs & lots of lows,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,2161,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'confusing', 'movie', 'had', 'watch', 'twice', 'understand', 'unfortunately', 'fell', 'asleep', 'second', 'time', 'watched', 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'horror', 'fan', 'fact', 'fell', 'asleep', 'how', 'not', 'interested', 'was', 'watching', 'again', 'stupid', 'friends', 'lol', 'anyway', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'alot', 'sense', 'not', 'much', 'point', 'movie', 'cause', 'right', 'beginning', 'rest', 'dream', 'more', 'likely', 'nightmare', 'pointless', 'cause', 'just', 'nightmare', ""n't"", 'make', 'scary', 'anymore', 'probably', 'why', 'fell', 'asleep', 'second', 'time', 'ok', 'one', 'viewing', 'cause', 'acting', 'fine', 'bit', 'plot', 'guess', 'just', 'so', 'weird', 'guess', 'visuals', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'did', 'everything', 'very', 'well', 'department', 'movie', 'least', 'tried', 'something', 'Doom', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summers', 'Screams', 'especially', 'House', 'Thousand', 'Corpses', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'so', 'yah', 'decent', 'horror', 'film', 'something', 'would', 'never', 'watch', 'again', 'cause', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'one', 'viewing', 'ok', ""'d"", 'say', 'rent', 'love', 'horror', 'films', 'got', 'nothing', 'better', 'rent', 'just', 'not', 'really', 'kinda', 'film', 'like', 'Thrillers', 'way', 'better', 'cause', 'find', 'scary', 'find', 'tend', 'have', 'better', 'plot', 'love', 'when', 'build', 'up', 'so', ""'re"", 'interested', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'Signs', 'film', 'was', 'kinda', 'just', 'dumb', 'horror', 'films', 'find', 'tend', 'focus', 'too', 'much', 'gore', 'not', 'enough', 'actually', 'being', 'scary', 'so', 'tend', 'stay', 'away', 'cause', 'just', 'disgusting', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'people', 'limbs', 'getting', 'hacked', 'off', 'film', 'have', 'fair', 'share', 'gore', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'too', 'much', 'plot', 'stupid', 'so', 'u', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'confusing', 'midly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'have', 'say', 'better', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'mean', 'compare', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'were', 'ok', 'more', 'fitting', 'comparison', 'Doom', 'was', 'absolute', 'disaster', 'compared', 'other', 'film', ""'d"", 'be', 'end', 'list', 'films', 'watch']",N/A

I've played all 4 games that have released state side so far, though ripping off the games 1-3 isn't what I expected from a movie based on a game.The plot was changed incorporate a female lead, which is the biggest difference, the main game Silent Hill is based on, is the first game, from which Harry was the main character. He was removed to have some woman running around yelling `Where's my daughter?', `I'm looking for my daughter!' gag. Her name, is Rose. The daughter's name was changed from Cheryl to Sharon. But other characters from the first game were kept - all the female ones that is. Cybil the policewoman, Dahlia the old woman (who I could actually stand!) and Lisa the nurse. All of the main male characters were removed, and only 2 men were actually focused on in this movie - Rose's husband and a policeman, but they weren't main parts of the movies just background really. Other extra female characters were also added in and the plot was changed.Pyramid Head - James Sunderland's own manifestation was featured in the movie for no reason. Pyramid Head was James' nemesis and didn't fit in with why he was there but it wonderful to see my favorite character return. This was the main Silent Hill 2 game addition.And the 3rd game addition from Silent Hill 3 was Rose becoming the mother of god, this had nothing to do with Rose because Cheryl is Heather. Heather is Alessa.Don't get me wrong, this movie was a lot better then the Resident Evil trilogy, at least this movie was sticking to the basics of what the game is about.",4,So Many Changes...,1158105600,"09 13, 2006",2006,1607,"[""'m"", 'not', 'complete', 'fan', 'movie-ripped-off-game', 'version', ""'ve"", 'played', '4', 'games', 'have', 'released', 'state', 'side', 'so', 'far', 'ripping', 'off', 'games', '1-3', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'movie', 'based', 'game.The', 'plot', 'was', 'changed', 'incorporate', 'female', 'lead', 'biggest', 'difference', 'main', 'game', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'based', 'first', 'game', 'Harry', 'was', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'removed', 'have', 'woman', 'running', 'around', 'yelling', 'Where', 'daughter', ""'m"", 'looking', 'daughter', 'gag', 'name', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'Cheryl', 'Sharon', 'other', 'characters', 'first', 'game', 'were', 'kept', 'female', 'ones', 'Cybil', 'policewoman', 'Dahlia', 'old', 'woman', 'who', 'could', 'actually', 'stand', 'Lisa', 'nurse', 'main', 'male', 'characters', 'were', 'removed', 'only', '2', 'men', 'were', 'actually', 'focused', 'movie', 'Rose', 'husband', 'policeman', 'were', ""n't"", 'main', 'parts', 'movies', 'just', 'background', 'really', 'Other', 'extra', 'female', 'characters', 'were', 'also', 'added', 'plot', 'was', 'changed.Pyramid', 'Head', 'James', 'Sunderland', 'own', 'manifestation', 'was', 'featured', 'movie', 'reason', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'was', 'James', 'nemesis', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'why', 'was', 'there', 'see', 'favorite', 'character', 'return', 'was', 'main', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'game', 'addition.And', '3rd', 'game', 'addition', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'was', 'Rose', 'becoming', 'mother', 'god', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'Rose', 'Cheryl', 'Heather', 'Heather', 'Alessa.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'then', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'trilogy', 'least', 'movie', 'was', 'sticking', 'basics', 'what', 'game', 'about']",N/A

The only movie that has ever come close to mimicking the game, to me, was Resident Evil (the first one), and even then the special effects in CGI are poorly done. The actors that sign onto these movies usually don't give Oscar caliber performances, so I don't expect much.This movie gets 6 out of ten. It was entertaining, and its visuals while a bit over the top were still good (Heavy on the CGI, but in this case it was warranted). One Complaint here was that the child actor in this was seriously horrible. She looked the part, and that might be the reason she was cast, but it was excruciating listening and watching her. Another was that Alice Krige has no range as an actress and has just one ""note"" that being an evil smirking slow talking pale faced woman. The ending, with the barb wire was a complete rip off from Hell Raiser, even in such that Silent Hill alternates in between realities Hell/Reality.  If you are a fan of Games than watch it, if you are a fan of horror you will be disappointed, because there were no true scares here when you take into account how hard it is to suspend disbelief when dealing with CGI.

She sat down with me and watched this and was glued to the television, completely involved. More so than me. (I wanted to watch it at night when it was dark, but she won't... too scary.) About halfway through, I mentioned the cliffs, the streets that have been broken apart as if Silent Hill were cut off from the world and how it was just like the video game... cool. She said, ""This was a video game?""So, before I begin, this is an excellent film and you don't have to know the video game to enjoy it. In fact, it is recommended, because you'll know less about what is coming and what to expect.Silent Hill is hands down the most successful Video game to Movie transfer to date, and I don't say that based on revenue. I say that based on quality of film and quality of entertainment.Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Chris DaSilva (Sean Bean) have adopted a beautiful and charming little girl named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). Knowing little of her past or where she came from, they are mystified and frustrated by the elaborate sleepwalking incidents and the unconscious mentioning of a mysterious ghost town named SILENT HILL. Getting nowhere with doctors or medication, Rose, in desperation, decides to bring Sharon to SILENT HILL and get to the bottom of her dreams.SILENT HILL is a fantastic mix of movie elements. It's not just a horror movie. It is a mystery. It is a riddle. It's the story of a Mother and Father who'll do anything to save their adopted daughter from her torment. On top of that, it's a wonderful display of graphics, visual effects and creature creation.As Officer Bennett (Laurie Holden) and Rose stare in amazement at the fact that the road they came in on has seemingly destroyed by a catastrophic earthquake, the blob-like armless man lumbers their way with its legs bowed inward. A fantastic build up of what's to come and what they're in for.I won't give away the elements of the story that make this a fantastic viewing experience. Giving away the elements will destroy the fun of the mystery. I will say that the movie managed to stay true to the game, but also took it in a completely different direction. The creators of the film made some great choices with their creative liberties.From the opening moments to the closing moments, SILENT HILL is intriguing and interesting. It never rests. It is solid from top to bottom. I'm not sure why I don't give it 5 stars, because I really liked it.

1001622,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000GCFO08,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 7]","""Silent Hill"" is a movie that succeeds in creating the right mood for a horror film: most of the scenes make use of a washed out color scheme, making every shot seem like a something surrounded by a fairly thick blanket of fog (or in this case, smoke). There are also a fair number of dark settings, which, as you may have guessed, are the ones where the scariest moments occur. It harkens back to the classic storytelling method of hiding something mysterious and possibly deadly within the shadows. It's good to see that even modern day horror filmmakers will sometimes rely on well-established formulas to effectively frighten the audience.But creating a mood is the only way in which ""Silent Hill"" is successful. Everything else--I'm sorry to say--misses the mark by a staggering degree. This is especially true of the story, something so full of holes that it could easily put Swiss cheese to shame. It isn't helped by numerous moments of unimpressive dialogue that don't border on cliche so much as they cross it and head for the horizon. That could be why many of the key scenes rely heavily on special effects and makeup tricks; Hollywood seems to think that when a plot loses cohesion, they have to give the audience eye candy to make up for it. Occasionally that methodology works, but in this case it was all just wasted effort, amounting to something that uses horror aesthetically instead of as a way to help the story progress.It's no secret that every horror movie requires some suspension of disbelief; otherwise, the whole genre would be debunked. The problems come when certain things are simply too unbelievable, even for an exaggerated concept. Herein lies one of the biggest issues I had with this movie, especially when it came to the character of Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell); she's a mother searching for her nine-year-old adopted daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), in the abandoned town of Silent Hill. For a woman who has lost her daughter in an unknown area, she still seems calm enough to stop every five minutes and examine a strange phenomenon.But I'm getting ahead of myself. Apparently, Sharon has been prone to bouts of sleepwalking, as shown during the opening scene in which her parents try to save her from unintentionally jumping over a rather large waterfall (a geographic feature not normally located within walking distance of a suburban area). All of her nightly excursions are frightening ordeals, especially since they end with her ranting and raving about Silent Hill, a place she's never visited or even heard of. Rose decides to take her daughter there against her husband's wishes (Sean Bean as Christopher Da Silva); since she screams the town's name in her sleep, and since her childlike drawings point to some strange clues, maybe going there will finally bring some answers to light. I guess it didn't matter to her that the very fabric of the town's social and economic structure unraveled after a devastating fire (which, according to local information, still burns deep beneath the city).Rose is almost pulled over by Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), a cop who is suspicious of anyone taking a child to Silent Hill (apparently she had arrested a man for throwing his son into one of the town's coal pits). But instead of obeying the law, Rose decides to speed way. She probably would have made it had she not swerved off the road to avoid hitting a child standing in the middle of the street.The incident causes her to hit her head on the steering wheel. When she awakens, Sharon is gone and everything outside is smoky and coated in ash. The frantic search for her daughter immediately lands her and Officer Bennett in the perpetually ashy Silent Hill; a place the audience already knows will be the start and the end of the whole mess.And here's where the scares start popping out. Not long after Rose's arrival, the wailing of a siren alert system is heard, after which the screen fades to black. When Rose ignites her lighter, everything around her--including the walls, floors, and ceilings--melts into a grotesque, undulating organic mass. This is immediately followed by the arrival of faceless, deformed beings that amble along like zombies. At a certain point, they burn away into ash and the walls and ceilings turn back to normal. This happens continuously throughout the film, and eventually other beings make their presence known, including a helmeted warrior-type equipped with a twenty-foot blade and an army of mutant insects.This marks the point when the already weak emphases on plot and character development collapse. Initially, the tense moments of creature encounters are effective; they certainly left me in anticipation of what their role in the story was. But as the crucial details were gradually revealed, I realized that the creatures added nothing to the film other than providing a few minutes of digital wizardry. Their scenes come off as unnecessary interludes in an already complex sequence of events. This includes encounters with some very enigmatic characters, such as Dahlia Gillespie (Deborah Kara Unger), a woman dressed in tattered black robes who babbles in seemingly incoherent religious terms. While virtually nothing about her is learned, we do know that she feels connected with Sharon, at times frighteningly so.Eventually Rose and Cybil meet a group of religious fanatics led by Christabelle (Alice Krige). This congregation has been able to avoid the periodic resurgence of creatures and melting architecture within the confines of a church. How they go about this is never explained; maybe they've somehow been able to bless the church. However, we do learn that they have previously used their faith as an excuse to conduct witch-hunts. We also learn that they don't care very much for Dahlia. This is mostly due to her daughter, Alessa (an important character who, as fate would have it, bears a striking resemblance to Sharon). I won't go into much detail; let's just say that something bad happened to someone a long time ago and now they want revenge.Of course, this movie also features Christopher as he goes on his own quest for the truth. He desperately searches for his wife and daughter amid some pretty tough obstacles, especially Officer Thomas Gucci (Kim Coates), who knows more about the town's dark past than he lets on. Or at least, that's the impression I got; ultimately, he says little if anything that hadn't already been established earlier in the story. He does do one helpful thing, though: he brings Christopher to Silent Hill so that they can both perform a quick search. (And here's the interesting thing: from their point of view, all traces of ash and smoke are gone. Now that's creepy.)So what exactly do we have here? Basically, we have a pretty bad mess of a film: the idea behind it was good, but the way it was told leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't help that the ending is a nonsensical, confusing pasting of shots; I'm convinced the director tacked it on at the last minute because of growing studio pressure. Still, I suppose fans of the video game series will like this movie. I ran into one just as I was leaving the theater, and according to him, this film adaptation of ""Silent Hill"" is perfect in every way. To each his own, I guess.",2,Something Terrible Must Have Happened Here....,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,7283,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'movie', 'creating', 'right', 'mood', 'horror', 'film', 'most',

The girl was adopted and originally lived in West Virginia. The mother does some research and finds out there is a town called Silent Hill in West Virginia and decides to take her daughter there to find a reason for the girl's problems. Silent Hill, it turns out is a dead town, consumed by an underground mine fire, and is fenced off from civilization. The mother is pulled over by a motorcycle cop who thinks she looks suspicious. The mother thinks the cop is suspicious herself and takes off. She blows through the fence and into Silent Hill, eventually crashing to a stop. When she comes to, her daughter is gone and she searches the ominous town for her. She eventually meets up with the cop again who also crashed her motorcycle and they find that Silent Hill is a very strange and haunted place. They are attacked by creatures made of fire and ash, they watch another creature kill a woman and end up in a church with a cult that follows the whims of one paranoid, deranged woman. The mother eventually faces the creature in the darkness and learns the secrets of the town and her adopted daughter.Silent Hill is a bad movie, mainly because it has no soul. The story, while odd, is not all together original and the movie depends too heavily on effects. Some of the effects are very cool, but meaningless as far as advancing the story. Also the story does not entirely make sense. Things happen that are never explained and the ending was confusing. The movie is too long for this type of film and the middle section gets pretty boring. A good actor, Sean Bean, is wasted with virtually nothing to do as the girl's father.

The game came out on the original Sony Playstation console.  It was one of the first of the so-called &#34;survival-horror&#34; genre of games, which included Resident Evil and Parasite Eve.  The genres popularity, as well as the dominance of the Sony Playstation console, ensured that the movie already had a large fan base even before it opened.Chris and Rose DaSilva are concerned with their adopted daughter's sleepwalking habits.  During these episodes, Sharon keeps referring to &#34;Slient Hill&#34;, a town in nearby West Virginia.  Rose then takes it upon herself to drive to Silent Hill, with Sharon in tow.  Miles outside of Silent Hill, she stops at a gas station.  While there, the attendant warns her not to proceed to the town.  Evidently, the town was evacuated many years before.  This is coal mine country.  Fire got started in the coal mines, deep beneath the town.  The fires continue to burn to this day, making Silent Hill a danger zone.Rose drives through the barricades and proceeds to the ghost town.  Meanwhile, a mysterious motorcycle police officer is in pursuit.  Rose swerves to avoid hitting a child, and runs off the road.  When she wakes up, Sharon is missing.  Rose starts to walk down the empty streets.  She meets up Dahlia, who informs her that she believe Sharon is actually Alessa.  With fog blanketing the town and ashes falling from the sky, Rose runs back to the car.  There, she meets up with Officer Cybil Bennett.  Together, they continue the search for Sharon.They learned that the town is not empty.  Silent Hill is populated by the members of a cult.  As darkness descends, they follow the members to the safety of a church.  While there, they are captured by the cult, led by the insane Christabella.  Slowly, the story of Silent Hill and Alessa begin to unfold.  Dahlia had a daughter out of wedlock.  Condemned by the town as an abomination, Alessa grew up without friends.  Other children tormented her, while the adults did not do anything to stop the bullying.  Christabella convinces Dahlia that the cult can help.  She proposes a ritual that would &#34;cleanse&#34; Alessa.  Dahlia agrees.  The cult takes Alessa into their church and straps her to an iron wheel.  Dahlia realizes too late that the cult intends to burn Alessa to death.  The cult proceeds with the ritual and sets Alessa aflame.  During the ritual, an explosion rocks the town.  The fire gets out of control.  Dahlia and the police arrive to stop the ritual.  Alessa, horribly burned but still alive, is taken to the hospital by Officer Gucci.  Alessa's anger and rage pulls the entire town into an alternate reality, created by her mind.  Her powers, fueled by anger and hate traps the town and the cult members into her dreamworld, filled with horrors.  Meanwhile, Alessa takes that part of her soul which is still good and manifests it into another child, Sharon.  Sharon is the &#34;good&#34; half of Alessa.Meanwhile, Chris arrives at the outskirts of town to look for his wife and daughter.  Stopped by the same Officer Gucci, Chris learns the tragic story of the town.  Unable to proceed into town, he then returns home.This is a very good horror movie.  Sean Bean, Radha Mitchell, Laurie Holden, Alice Kriege, Kim Coates, and Deborah Kara Unger make up the all-star cast.

There are times when the visuals are so amazing that I actually got very excited and wished more movies could be like Silent Hill.  It generally has a decent pace working for it until about the last third.  Then it seems to become a tangle of plot explanation, dragging it slowly down and un-doing all that came before it.  The ending of the game version was far better I thought, but I suppose because this is a movie aimed at fitting the criteria of a film, the director, screenwriter and producers would have been broke if they had attempted to re-create the game entirely.  Honestly though, they hit all the deeply disturbing spots from anything and everything Silent Hill.  I was glad to see that this wasn't another sell-out to make it a PG-13 movie and simply reap the finances.  It is disturbing, very gory and should please any horror fan.  I wouldn't reccomend taking the little ones to this one.  There are some very dark, nightmarish sequences that would seriously scar them for a long time.For gamers who love this game, you'll like it I think.  Like I said, the ending is the only let down and it seemed like getting there was a bit painful.  The Pyraimd -Head was absolutely amazing.  Forget all of the garabge that both Resident Evil films were.  This one smokes them both.  It hits the atmosphere on the ball, it usese the music from the first three games and pulls you straight into Silent Hill, the nighmare world where two separate planes keep switching.Overall, I'd say 3.5 stars, just because for the writer and director to have pulled off the first 2/3 with such proficiency and effectiveness made me think they didn't put in their full effort to end it more effectively.  Plenty of people at the theater voiced their negative opinions quite loudly as the credits began to roll, but I knew better.  Most Americans expect the in-your-face-horror-movies like Saw or Hostel.  Silent Hill is more subtle, yet far more disturbing and much better done than any horror movie I have seen in a long time.  It's sad that people who saw this discarded the first two-thirds of the movie simply because they hated the ending.  I am able to appreciate, forgive and forget.  Hopefully the sequel will be a little better meditated on.If you like horror flicks, you'll be impressed by the music, gore and overall creepiness.  If you like the game, I'm sure you'll be as equally impressed.  If you don't like either, or you only have a very shallow understanding of horror, you will be disappointed and upset.  It's great on the big screen, but I don't see Silent Hill winning any awards.

1001629,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B000GCFO08,"Cloud ""...""","[2, 2]","Funnily enough, the one film people say is the best videogame adaptation is Mortal Kombat, directed by much-maligned(but not really by me) director Paul W.S Anderson, with the Resident Evil ones at least being ""decent"". The Tomb Raiders, Doom, and so on were just absolutely horrible. Well Christophe Gans, the one behind the Brotherhood of the Wolf, probably gives us the next best adaptation but ultimately fails in the same area the others have.Chris and Rose are dealing with the fact that their daughter Sharon sleepwalks. In her dazes, she mentions a place called Silent Hill, an old town in West Virginia. Wanting to get answers, Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill. However, they find very disturbing and strange things that do more than bump in the night, and a cult of religious fanatics who are, for lack of a better phrase, hellbent on ridding the town of evil.Since it is a videogame adaptation, certain things in the story such as explanations are sacrificed for character and creep-out scenes. For example, besides a nasty looking janitor, what are the other creatures and how did they become to be that way? We have nurses, armless men, and soon-to-be everyone's favorite, Pyramid Head. Then there's just weirdness such as why would Chris and Rose live next to a cliff if Sharon sleepwalks? And why do the air-raid siren scenes happen at certain times then disappear.Then there's the banality in some of the dialogue. Characters come across a room that is visibly burned. ""This looks like there was a fire here"" says one of them. Ashes fall and leave a mark on a character's finger: ""ashes"" she says. Well gee, obviously! There was a bit too much references to the game that seemed kinda odd. A character finds clues or ""puzzle pieces"" let's say, which for some reason I started to say ""you found the flashlight. Will you take the flashlight? You took the flashlight."" There's even platform jumping and I thought ""wrong genre guys"".The film does however succeed on its atmosphere and sound design. Unlike Resident Evil, which went from a dark horror game to a well-lit combat movie, Silent Hill maintains the look and feel of the games which you haven't seen a lot in these adaptations. Then there's the sound design and music which perfectly matches what the games had, with weird atonal ambience mixed with light melancholy piano. While it's one of the few times a film matched its source material, the story still feels off like the others had.I think we can expect a double-dip soon. There's no commentary and we only have 6 featurettes which run roughly 10 minutes each. Not to mention there's behind the scenes stuff that you never saw in the movie such as the character's run-in with another armless men before going to a hotel. If you absolutely want Silent Hill then buy it but if you're one of those extras freaks like I am, then wait around a bit.It's not really a film for everyone. Best way to describe it is that if Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat and maybe the first Tomb Raider were at least passable to you then check this film out. But since this is better than something like Doom, Wing Commander or Super Mario Bros, you should also try it.",4,Well at least we're getting somewhere...,1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,3170,"['Funnily', 'enough', 'one', 'film', 'people', 'say', 'best', 'videogame', 'adaptation', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'directed', 'much-maligned', 'not', 'really', 'director', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'ones', 'least', 'being', 'decent', 'Tomb', 'Raiders', 'Doom', 'so', 'were', 'just', 'absolutely', 'horrible', 'Well', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'one', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'probably', 'next', 'best', 'adaptation', 'ultimately', 'same', 'area', 'others', 'have.Chris', 'Rose', 'are', 'dealing', 'fact', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'sleepwalks', 'dazes', 'place', 'called', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'old', 'town', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Wanting', 'get', 'answers', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'However', 'find', 'very', 'disturbing', 'strange', 'things', 'do', 'more', 'bump', 'night', 'cult', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'who', 'are', 'lack', 'better', 'phrase', 'hellbent', 'ridding', 'town', 'evil.Since', 'videogame', 'adaptation', 'certain', 'things', 'story', 'such', 'explanations', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'character', 'creep-out', 'scenes', 'example', 'nasty', 'looking', 'janitor', 'what', 'are', 'other', 'creatures', 'how', 'did', 'become', 'be', 'way', 'have', 'nurses', 'armless', 'men', 'soon-to-be', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'Then', 'just', 'weirdness', 'such', 'why', 'would', 'Chris', 'Rose', 'live', 'next', 'cliff', 'Sharon', 'sleepwalks', 'why', 'do', 'air-raid', 'siren', 'scenes', 'happen', 'certain', 'times', 'then', 'disappear.Then', 'banality', 'dialogue', 'Characters', 'come', 'room', 'visibly', 'burned', 'was', 'fire', 'here', 'one', 'Ashes', 'fall', 'leave', 'mark', 'character', 'finger', 'ashes', 'Well', 'gee', 'obviously', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'references', 'game', 'seemed', 'kinda', 'odd', 'character', 'clues', 'puzzle', 'pieces', 'let', 'say', 'reason', 'started', 'say', 'found', 'flashlight', 'Will', 'take', 'flashlight', 'took', 'flashlight', 'even', 'platform', 'jumping', 'thought', 'wrong', 'genre', 'guys', '.The', 'film', 'however', 'succeed', 'atmosphere', 'sound', 'design', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'went', 'dark', 'horror', 'game', 'well-lit', 'combat', 'movie', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'look', 'feel', 'games', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'lot', 'adaptations', 'Then', 'sound', 'design', 'music', 'perfectly', 'what', 'games', 'had', 'weird', 'atonal', 'ambience', 'mixed', 'light', 'melancholy', 'piano', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'film', 'matched', 'source', 'material', 'story', 'still', 'others', 'had.I', 'can', 'expect', 'double-dip', 'soon', 'commentary', 'only', 'have', '6', 'featurettes', 'run', 'roughly', '10', 'minutes', 'Not', 'mention', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'never', 'saw', 'movie', 'such', 'character', 'run-in', 'armless', 'men', 'going', 'hotel', 'absolutely', 'want', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'then', 'buy', ""'re"", 'one', 'extras', 'freaks', 'am', 'then', 'wait', 'around', 'bit.It', 'not', 'really', 'film', 'everyone', 'Best', 'way', 'describe', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Mortal', 'Kombat', 'maybe', 'first', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'were', 'least', 'passable', 'then', 'check', 'film', 'out', 'better', 'something', 'Doom', 'Wing', 'Commander', 'Super', 'Mario', 'Bros', 'should', 'also', 'try']",N/A

1001632,A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,B000GCFO08,"Conner Macleod ""Afficionado""","[6, 15]","Entirely forgettable film. Saw it last night and I left the theater completely indifferent towards the movie. 'Silent Hill' fails at nearly every single level except for style, sounds and visuals. Beyond that there's really no story to speak of, virtually non-existent or pointless dialogue, nonsensical actions by the main characters that contradicts otherwise logical behavior and there was a severe over reliance on CGI and special effects.Perhaps the biggest problem was the directing of the film.  I honestly don't think Gans is a bad director, but I do think he was wrong for this particular film. His style isn't suited for the 'Silent Hill' storyline, since any film based on those games call for probing into the human psyche, reaching the innermost, dark corners of the mind and leaving a haunting imprint that will genuinely scare the audience. The frantic pace and the action sequences worked perfectly for his best movie to date, 'Brotherhood of the Wolf', since its theme required it, but that was a completely wrong approach for 'Silent Hill' which needs to be slower paced, more emphasis on the scariness of silence, and a focus on what is not seen rather than the metaphorical big blunt object in plain sight.'Silent Hill' needed the type of psychological horror that masters like Hitchcock and M. Night Shyamalan can create, the quiet, subtle direction in which they take their films for maximum effect. Shyamalan would have been perfect for this film because he understands the concept of less is more and how to delve into our internal fears and exploit them on the big screen.  Gans on the other hand went for a by the numbers approach, throwing visuals and quantities of CGI at us, but all that was necessary was substance and quality and unfortunately that was sorely lacking.We should expect nothing less than much better than this and I do not buy into the mentality of ""this is good enough"" or ""don't expect an Oscar worthy production"".  A film does not have to be an Oscar contender in order to be entertaining or great, but there is no excuse for mediocrity.  It was a good try I'll admit but it overshoots way above par. Gans lacked focus, a sense of direction, he was all over the golf course with 'Silent Hill'. He needed to focus on shooting the ball into one hole at a time, not all 18.I mean honestly what is so difficult with sticking to the original material, sans a few minor liberal interpretations?  I honestly do not see why he would have to change it one bit, except for a detail or two. A Hitchcockian approach with the material from the games would have been perfect. Just imagine the director stringing the audience along with a few minor hints of horrors to come, rather than with the in your face approach that Gans used what seemed like every couple of minutes. Subtlety is the key, the movie acting as a puppet master with the audience, toying with what they see and think as opposed to blatantly telling what the audience should see and think. The shock and awe factor does zilch for me, it has been done too many times and there is no immediate nor lasting psychological effect. It screamed CGI, big whoop. Where is the genuine fear that the games gave people? That's what this movie was supposed to accomplish.Aren't the 'Silent Hill' games fun because the players are never sure exactly what is going on, and part of the fun is delving deeper into it to find out exactly what lies behind the curtain? What I have read about the games and what the movie should have been was not an amusement park house of horrors, instead it should have been good ol' fashioned mystery with horrors beyond imagination. I've seen 'Saw', it's cliche', I wanted something cerebral. I really do not think that is expecting too much.  It has been done before and could be done again with someone who understands the material and how to conceptualize it.Sean Bean's character might as well have phoned in his performance, which ironically wouldn't be all that different from what he accomplished. His part could have been effective but as it stands it was pointless.  Sean Bean is an excellent actor and perfect for this type of film, so why not fully utilize his talent and give him something solid to work with? His contributions went nowhere, quickly. They could easily have cut his part out and the film wouldn't have sufferend one iota.The female cop, who I liked initially, was unfortunately stricken with the stupidity syndrome.  For example, why oh why did she not follow the girl's mother down the elevator? What possible sense did it make for her to stand her ground against the cultists, with an empty gun no less? What did she hope to achieve by her sacrifice? I saw no reason why she shouldn't have followed the mother down the shaft.  The reason seemed that she wanted to sacrifice herself to save the mother, but they would have been better off working together as they did for a while, there was no logic behind it.  The mother had her idiotic moments as well. The car chase in which she escapes the police offer was ridiculous, and the arrest scene makes one wonder about her intelligence, as if she did not realize why she was being arrested.I have not played the games, but I should not have to in order to understand the plot or relate to the characters. Going into this film, I was expecting at the very least to be scared or shocked somewhat, but I was never frightened nor all that shocked. Once the writer and director decided to get rid of character development, the movie should compensate with scariness, but any genuinely scary moments were nonexistent.The film's job is to translate the concept into something that's palatable and relevant for the average movie goer, just as much as it is trying to stay true to its roots. 'Silent Hill' should stand on its own merits, video game background or not, that shouldn't really matter, but as it is, the film lacks the backbone of a classic horror film. It's quick, easy and entirely disposable.Who are these people? What do we know about them? Why should we care what happens to any of them? There is nothing revealed at any point that would make anyone care one way or the other as to what happens to a single character, other than simply on principle of the universal concept of a mother ferociously defending her child at all costs, but even that idea seemed like days old chinese food with too much MSG, given the manner in which it was presented.There were a few positive elements as I mentioned, such as the look of the monsters, the town, and the CGI was impressive albeit ineffective and anticlimactic. The sound and music was eerie and jarring, but after awhile it became passe' and without an effective plot and action sequences its use became redundant. The graphics were gratuitous however and way over the top, despite the realism of the computer graphics. I am not impressed by the shock factor of modern horror films since I've been there, done that, bought the t-shirt and taken the roller coaster ride far too many times.  This movie copies the same formula as 99% of other Hollywood horror films, with little to no originality.I sat through the whole movie waiting for something to engage me in the story, to pull me in and make me care for what happens to the parents and their child, but the film was too busy with too many things happening at once, so much so that any buildup that was started at some point was lost 5 seconds later with something inconsequential and irrelevant in terms of plot importance. The monsters were window dressing, little more than mannequins or wax dolls. Where was the exposition of the characters and the town itself?Just because the film is based on a video game that does not mean that the standard rules for film making goes out the window. Simplicity and authenticity are the two keys to a successful film based on video games. Less is more. It does not get any easier than that.An example that I have used in the past is 'Mortal Kombat' which captures the essence of the video games. It doesn't try too hard to do anything spectactular, it stays true to its source material and does not deviate and uses enough elements from the games with enough of the story to make the audience care about what happens, and it's simple enough for both fans and newcomers to appreciate, understand and be entertained by what happens on screen. Is it a great film, no, but it is a good film and it accomplishes what it sought to do, which was make an entertaining, fun film based on a series of popular video games, and hopefully translate that concept into a universal medium that is approachable to all audiences without straying too far from its root.'Silent Hill' is an overachiever that tried too hard to do too much in too little time and as a result it failed. It is better than many video game based films, but that is not really a compliment considering the genre.  The creators of 'Silent Hill' would have been better off focusing the film on the first game, rather than trying to put all games into one film.  I give the film 1 star for style and 1 for the soundtrack, but it loses out on substance and depth.",2,'Silent Hill'  Was Over Ambiguous.,1146268800,"04 29, 2006",2006,9164,"['Entirely',

1001634,A1U45RTE16447K,B000GCFO08,CrackerBarrel,"[5, 13]","FIRST AND FOREMOST...i've played and LOVE the games (and i prefer them IN ORDER from 1 to 4). ALSO,...i think the soundtracks by Akira Yamaoka are brilliant (i own them all).THAT BEING SAID...........this film IS somewhat disappointing (which is a shame because the opportunity for greatness really WAS there). IT IS ""miles"" better than those Resident Evil jokes (in fact...it really is THE BEST video-game-to-film adapation to date),...but it just never quite materializes as being consistently good from start to finish.this movie DOES have atmosphere.....and it has it NAILED. the sets are brilliant and VERY detailed. Radha Mitchell is superb (as she always is) and really seems to sink her teeth into this role.....but everything else is just VERY average. the story is convoluted and really seems to contradict the pyschological prisons that are SO prevelant in the games. the feeling of isolation that makes Silent Hill so unique is spoiled by an ""Adams Family"" type cult that preoccupies too much of the story. Rose's departures into the ""alternate"" Silent Hill aren't nearly dramatic enough (nor very well explained). Sean Bean's character is almost meaningless. ALSO,....(and i must reiterate that i am a HUGE fan of Akira Yamaoka and the Silent Hill game soundtracks) I MUST SAY that the music editing/arrangement for this film was absolutely horrible. it's almost as if someone deliberatly tried to superimpose a ""best of Akira Yamaoka"" mix over the entire film. many queues were completely inappropriate or poorly timed. i'd like to see the music score redone....perhaps focusing on ONE central theme and reproducing it very subtly. the ""Akira's Greatest Hits"" approach really ruined the atmosphere and lacked imagination.On the POSITIVE side,..there were plenty of interesting uses of lighting and camera angles (many of these will be familiar to players of the games). Most of the special effects were pretty good (particularly the physical transformation of the environment from real to ""alternate""). HOWEVER,..things just seem a bit too ""GRATUITOUS"" at times,..as if too many elements from all the games were attempted to be squeezed into one film. I found myself shifting from my own ""real-to-alternate"" worlds as i was quite interested (and entertained) for 20 minutes and then bored-to-tears the next 20. ALL IN ALL it was a good try (it was certainly quite an undertaking) and while it DOES have it's moments,...Silent Hill just isn't quite the complete package.I'd have to rate this as a somewhat (at least for me) disappointing experience. maybe i should have just rented this dvd,....but,...well,...i already own all 4 games and all 4 soundtracks (plus a few bootlegs),..so i was BOUND to buy it anyway. watch it if you are a SERIOUS fan (but you are likely to be a bit annoyed). it ain't horrible but it ain't THAT good.p.s. Sean Bean,....you deserve better than this.p.s.s. Radha Mitchell,...you MADE this watchable...thanks.p.s.s.s. if you really want a good scare,...go see THE DESCENT.EDIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i have watched the movie through for a SECOND time now. i must say that i liked it a bit better this time around. maybe it's because it IS a nice change of pace from the usual horror ""fodder"" we monster movie fans have to sift through on a weekly basis in order to find a good flick. Silent Hill attempts to adapt the video games (which are purely horrific psychological acid trips) into a film of similar complexity. it ulitmately falls a little bit short,..but the attempt is admirable. the first 45 minutes (or so) succeed pretty well. THEN the film bogs down in an overcomplicated script and fairly crappy dialogue. the music editing STILL bugged me in MANY places (not the fault of Yamaoka's work,..but of poorly timed/chosen queues). the dialogue was embarrassing in a few spots. ""Pyramid Head"" (for all the EMOTIONAL GRAVITY that he embellished in SH2) makes an uneccessarily gratuitous and completely unexplained appearance in the film. the nurses in Brookhaven Hospital are comical (looking more like extras in Robert Palmer's ""Addicted To Love"" video than the murderous carnivores in SH1). BUT......despite it's faults....it is still a ""keeper"" in my DVD collection. overall the ""atmosphere"" CARRIES this film home. i really would like to see a ""re-edited"" version of the film (both music AND footage).....but,...i guess we'll have to wait for Silent Hill 2 (NOW,..if Gans followed the story of THAT game ""to the letter"",..we might REALLY have something).i OFFICIALLY bump up my review to THREE AND THREE QUARTER STARS (3.75***).",3,Atmosphere and Radha Mitchell....and not much else.........,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,4681,"['FIRST', 'FOREMOST', 'i', ""'ve"", 'played',

1001635,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,B000GCFO08,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[5, 7]","Plain and simple `Silent Hill' is a beautiful horror film, beautiful in sense that the effects are top notch, the imagery is effective and the set pieces are out of this world.  That aside, `Silent Hill' tries a little to hard to make a drama out of a horror film.  I'm not against the idea of a horror film being a dramatic staple, but `Silent Hill' could never be that movie.  I saw an interview with Radha Mitchell before the film was released (Mitchell by the way does a wonderful acting job here even if it was unnecessary) and she was going on about how this is more than a horror movie, how it's about the maternal instincts of love and devotion to child and how the woman will do anything to save her child.  What really shocked me was that she looked sincere.I just want to make this very clear, this movie is about demons and satanic rituals and sacrifice and revenge...not about mother daughter time.  Yes, Rose (Mitchell) is struggling to find her lost daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) but that's not our main concern while watching.  The story, as you may not be privy to, is about a young girl Sharon, adopted by her loving parents Rose and Christian (Sean Bean).  This young girl suffers from sleep walking, and in her dreams she utters the words ""Silent Hill"" so in an attempt to cure her daughter Rose drives her to the ghost town to confront the nightmare.Big mistake.  What happens next is a montage of disturbing scenes and the unraveling of a horrifying back story that explains (somewhat) what's going on.  A friend of mine whose played all of the games said they need to make a few sequels to really make more sense of it...I have only played the games sporadically and didn't really know much about it at all so I was left a little confused, yet not enough to where I was dumbfounded, I mean, you can figure it all out if you try hard enough.So anyone who's played the game will enjoy he masterpiece brought to life, and it's wonderfully done.

1001636,A169I83JL8QJGN,B000GCFO08,Daniel A Moir,"[3, 4]","Back in the late 90's we had been playing Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark for a while, and the horror fans of the world were already complaining that the game play had began to turn stale. We're always crying for innovation (especially in films, but I'll spare you that complaint.) Konami answered our cries for innovation by presenting us with a very different kind of horror in Silent Hill.Most horror games relied heavily on zombies, and quick ""Boo... Ahh!"" scare to get it's job done. Silent Hill didn't do that very often, but what it did do was expose you to extremely disturbing images, and monsters that defy any conventional explanation. Are they Demons? Are they undead? Or more disturbing, Silent Hill 3's ""They look like monsters to you?""The best thing about Silent Hill was it's amazing story which revolved around a young woman named Alessa Gillespie who had extraordinary powers, powers, her mother Dahlia wanted to use to benefit the Cult of Samael. Everything that happened to Alessa was at the hands of her abusive mother, including being lit on fire. Dahlia even went so far as to misguide and trick Harry into working against Alessa who was trying to prevent the coming of Samael when Harry had to break a seal at a certain place and time where Alessa would be doing some sort of incantation, thus halting Alessa's progress... what I'm getting at is that it's true that in the Bad and Bad+ ending of Silent Hill Alessa was the end boss, however, and it is true that she was the root cause of the twisted world of Silent Hill. But, the witches, Dahlia, and the Order (AKA Cult of Samael) were indeed the bad guys, and in the ending I got Samael herself was the end boss. (I say her because of Silent Hill 3's revelations.)Silent Hill the movie starts off similarly enough to the game that for the first hour or so a fan of the game will indeed be at the edge of their seat waiting, and waiting, and waiting for the scares to come. People who haven't played the game may enjoy the story, and the visuals, but aren't likely going to be getting scared by this film either. Non-fans will say that they never got the impression that Rose was ever in any real danger. The moment death was at hand the enemies (Whether they be skinless demon children who now have eyes and mouths making them less creepy) or the infamous Pyramid Head (Originally a delusion by James Sunderland in Silent Hill 2) just dissolve the moment Rose is about to be killed, thus eliminating any real feeling of danger.Fans of the series can simply complain that Christophe Gans strayed too far from the original story. While he nailed most of the visuals dead on the plot doesn't seem Silent Hill like at all. For a while this film was code-named Centralia. I left this film wondering if the original story was going to be Centralia, but that Konami, who was seeking to do a Silent Hill film felt that the two were similar enough that they could both save some time and money by combining their efforts. This, if true, hurt the production. Silent Hill's original story could have saved this production, and or Centralia could have been saved by not limiting itself to the Silent Hill universe. If Gans wanted to do his own thing, he should have, instead I now have no way to present the original story that I love to my family members who don't play games, and I had talked this one up quite a bit.The first half of the movie, as I stated, is not scary, but is pretty cool nonetheless. Pyramid Head doesn't do anything uber-disturbing like his video game counterpart, but he does cause a really awesome fatality to one of the unimportant characters. Later on when the towns folks start screaming "" a witch! A witch!"" I found myself feeling nostalgic for Monty Python rather than the original Silent Hill. These movie folks need to stop straying for the original material.The story also starts out following the original plot closely enough but looses critical things like the hallucinogen that the Order was using, Dr. Huffman was nixed,  and although Nurse Garland makes a brief cameo her character is changed dramatically. As I stated earlier, the original plot didn't deal with Alessa being nearly killed by witch hunters, rather being subjected to abuse at the hands of the Order, and eventually suffering from being burnt alive by Dahlia, which is why in her room you see messages like ""Mom... mom kill..."" and ""help me..."" It's true that Alessa's soul was split up like in the movie, but Alessa lured Harry to Silent Hill to help her to defeat the cult of Samael, not for revenge against a bunch of witch hunters.Perhaps the biggest complaint I have about Silent Hill the movie is the ending. I know that Silent Hill spreads. It chooses who it wants, and when it will let people go. It's possible that Rose and Sharon were simply not yet allowed to leave, but many people felt that the ending meant that they had died in the car crash, similar to one of the bad endings in the original game. If this is the case, however, I do wonder how on earth Gans will follow this film up, especially since Alessa is the lead in Silent Hill 3. That's right, you play as Alessa. The bigger problem is that since the 6th Sense too many writers and directors think that the ""Oh and at the end they're revealed to be dead"" ending is still unique. If indeed that is the case here then, no Christophe, this is not a unique ending. It's another ""me too"" 6th Sense rip off. If there's more too it than that then it simply was not clear enough for the uninitiated.For Silent Hill fans it should be noted that although it nails most of the visuals dead on, the creepy feel of Silent Hill is lost, largely in part for Gan's silly ""A Witch! A Witch!"" replacement of the original story. Fans will likely feel, as I did, that the movie is very cool, especially visually, but will be disappointed that Gans strayed so far from the original plot, and that the monsters are under whelming, and even misused.One such example is the demon nurse sequence. The demon nurses work well in the game. One or two at a time the way they move is extremely creepy, but in a large group like this it looked to me like they would break out into the Thriller dance routine. It was silly, not scary. And Pyramid Head should have had a lot more to do with in this film.Non-fans will likely walk away with no clue what just happened or what made the game so great.Books and game adaptations do have to undergo some changes to make them work on film, and I understand that. However, pretty much every video game to film adaptation except Mortal Kombat has been absolutely terrible because they stray too far from the source material. Hollywood does their own thing, and then slaps a well-known label on it.But I have to ask, if the story from the game is good enough to make one want to do an adaptation, then why change the original premise? Silent Hill and Resident Evil have both nixed the original protagonists in favor of less interesting female leads. I felt more for Sean Bean's Christopher than I did for Rose. Rose was never in any real danger, Christopher was fighting loosing his entire family. That element of the film worked well on an emotional level. There is no good reason that Harry Mason needed to be replaced with a woman. None. Whatever excuses Gans throws out there the only reason this was done is because recent horror films have this idea that women should be the lead protagonists in all horror films, likely because they scream better than men. Fans of Lord of the Rings would have screamed bloody murder for this had Frodo been made a woman. I have nothing against women in lead roles. In fact, in original stories like the Ring or the Grudge I encourage it. But if the lead in the original story the film is based on is a weakly thirty-something male writer who is a widower with a sickly 7 year old girl it aught to stay that way. It is not okay to change the lead protagonist when adapting a book, the same reverence for source material that Hollywood has for novels needs to be extended toward video games as well.Simply put this movie would have been infinitely better had it stayed true to the original story, but like Resident Evil before it, it falls apart when it begins to stray. That said, unlike Resident Evil, this movie is still pretty cool based on its visual merits.With that said this movie is not un-enjoyable, and is the best video game adaptation since Mortal Kombat. Just don't expect anything super special, let alone scary.",3,"Cool but not scary, and not exactly true to the game",1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,8522,"['Back', 'late', '90', 'had', 'been',

1001643,A3DD70OOO17HHZ,B000GCFO08,"Declan Gallagher ""D""","[3, 20]","Well, it had nice cinematography. 'Silent Hill' started with some promise, and it had a good, creepy plot. However, all of that was squandered after the first ten minutes. I can understand how, since this movie is based off a popular series of video games, that the movie may have to be mostly action, since very few video games are story-driven. But, what we get here is a nice start with a tight, concise plot, and some creepy scenes, but once the movie moves itself to the town of Silent Hill, it becomes a stupid action movie, and the main plot dissapears. I have no problem with action movies, but my problem with this movie is that it's not scary, it's action is boring, the acting is bad, for the most part, and the set design is ugly. However, the cinematography was nice.The movie would have benefited from being cut by about a half hour, and most of that could have been action that was cut. On top of the bloated running time, the movie made no friggin' sense. It was basically a version of 'The Village' with elders that like to burn people. I came out of the movie not knowing what happened, and not really caring, since the movie was like a slap in the face and just as enjoyable. I can't begin to describe how poorly made this movie is. Strung together with pieces of film stock or something cheap, the movie looks like a college student made it. The camerawork was nice, and the town of Silent Hill was captured nicely, especially with the constant fog.While there are some creepy moments in the movie, they mostly involves sirens or flashlights. The movie came alive twice in the third act, and it was a saving grace...but not enough to make the movie good. In an extended sequence, barbed wire rips around a church, causing damage and eventually ripping people to pieces. In another scene, a flashback, we hear about a girl who was thought to be a witch, then burned. The scene is shot in a way that makes it look like a 1970's horror movie. But then the movie goes back to its extreme lack of just about everything.The plot has Rose (Radha Mitchell) taking her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill. Sharon has been screaming the name of the town in her sleep, and Rose thinks that taking her there will help her. Silent Hill was set ablaze several years ago by a coal fire that still burns underground. At times, the fire knocks out all electricity, and featurless zombies pop out. At least I think it was the fires causing this. This is about the amount of clarity in this film. The zombies that come out from said fires are naked and can hardly walk, possibly because they drip acid blood (in a more interesting moment in my viewing experience, some girl in the very back of the theater remarked ""Look! It's on its period!"") But later, it is revealed that, no, the monsters are not having their time of the month, but simply are just deformed miners caught in the blasts underground. I think.If you do see 'Silent Hill', which I do not endorse in any way whatsoever, then take head in my warning: DO NOT PAY FOR IT! Whether you have a free ticket to something like 'Ice Age' that you could care less about seeing, then use it to see this. But it would probably be better to do what I do whenever I am dissatisfied with a movie: sneak into another one and say it was that one that you payed for. This had a good plot and good actors that it could have put to good use, and the direction is flawless, but as it stands, 'Silent Hill' is an incomprehensible, poor, irresponsibly violent movie.Running Time: 126 MinutesMPAA Rating: R for strong horror violence/gore, disturbing images, and some language.",1,Trek To 'Silent Hill': A Vacation You're Sure To Regret Paying For,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,3634,"['Well', 'had', 'nice', 'cinematography', 'Hill', 'started', 'promise', 'had', 'good', 'creepy', 'plot', 'However', 'was', 'squandered', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'movie', 'based', 'off', 'popular', 'series', 'video', 'games', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'be', 'mostly', 'action', 'very', 'few', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'story-driven', 'what', 'get', 'here', 'nice', 'start', 'tight', 'concise', 'plot', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'once', 'movie', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'stupid', 'action', 'movie', 'main', 'plot', 'dissapears', 'have', 'problem', 'action', 'movies', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'scary', 'action', 'boring', 'acting', 'bad', 'most', 'part', 'set', 'design', 'ugly', 'However', 'cinematography', 'was', 'nice.The', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'benefited', 'being', 'cut', 'half', 'hour', 'most', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'action', 'was', 'cut', 'top', 'bloated', 'running', 'time', 'movie', 'made', 'friggin', 'sense', 'was', 'basically', 'version', ""'The"", 'Village', 'elders', 'like', 'burn', 'people', 'came', 'out', 'movie', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'not', 'really', 'caring', 'movie', 'was', 'slap', 'face', 'just', 'enjoyable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'how', 'poorly', 'made', 'movie', 'Strung', 'together', 'pieces', 'film', 'stock', 'something', 'cheap', 'movie', 'college', 'student', 'made', 'camerawork', 'was', 'nice', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'captured', 'nicely', 'especially', 'constant', 'fog.While', 'are', 'creepy', 'moments', 'movie', 'mostly', 'sirens', 'flashlights', 'movie', 'came', 'alive', 'twice', 'third', 'act', 'was', 'saving', 'grace', 'not', 'enough', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'extended', 'sequence', 'barbed', 'wire', 'rips', 'church', 'causing', 'damage', 'eventually', 'ripping', 'people', 'pieces', 'scene', 'flashback', 'hear', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'thought', 'be', 'witch', 'then', 'burned', 'scene', 'shot', 'way', 'look', '1970', 'horror', 'movie', 'then', 'movie', 'back', 'extreme', 'lack', 'just', 'everything.The', 'plot', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'taking', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Sharon', 'been', 'screaming', 'name', 'town', 'sleep', 'Rose', 'taking', 'will', 'help', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'set', 'ablaze', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'coal', 'fire', 'still', 'underground', 'times', 'fire', 'out', 'electricity', 'featurless', 'zombies', 'pop', 'out', 'least', 'think', 'was', 'fires', 'causing', 'amount', 'clarity', 'film', 'zombies', 'come', 'out', 'said', 'fires', 'are', 'naked', 'can', 'hardly', 'walk', 'possibly', 'drip', 'acid', 'blood', 'more', 'interesting', 'moment', 'viewing', 'experience', 'girl', 'very', 'back', 'theater', 'remarked', 'Look', 'period', 'later', 'revealed', 'monsters', 'are', 'not', 'having', 'time', 'month', 'simply', 'are', 'just', 'deformed', 'miners', 'caught', 'blasts', 'think.If', 'do', 'see', ""'Silent"", 'Hill', 'do', 'not', 'endorse', 'way', 'whatsoever', 'then', 'take', 'head', 'warning', 'DO', 'NOT', 'PAY', 'IT', 'Whether', 'have', 'free', 'ticket', 'something', ""'Ice"", 'Age', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'seeing', 'then', 'use', 'see', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'better', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'whenever', 'am', 'dissatisfied', 'movie', 'sneak', 'one', 'say', 'was', 'one', 'payed', 'had', 'good', 'plot', 'good', 'actors', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'good', 'use', 'direction', 'flawless', 'Hill', 'incomprehensible', 'poor', 'irresponsibly', 'violent', 'movie.Running', 'Time', '126', 'MinutesMPAA', 'Rating', 'R', 'strong', 'horror', 'violence/gore', 'disturbing', 'images', 'language']",N/A

I felt that like I had to force myself to watch it, which isn't something you should be doing with a horror film.

1001654,A3DIKJP95XTKX0,B000GCFO08,"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley""","[6, 6]","I have never played the game so I approached this film with a completely neutral mindset. I had not read any reviews of it, prior to seeing it either. For me this was a film from Cristopher Gans, the director of the remarkable and original 'Brotherhood Of The Wolf.' As such his most recent outing deserved my attention. And in a nutshell, I was not disappointed either.Silent Hill is taken from the game of the same title. The scenario is an abandoned town which sits in mountainous terrain and has been abandoned by its inhabitants because of the massive underground fires which are burning all around, perpetually fed by the subterranean coal seams. The sky is grey due to the smoke from these fires. In an eerie and stunning visual (which is disturbingly like scenes from Auschwitz) ash continuously falls from the sky like snow. The inhabitants of this town are a congregation of religious fanatics, totally in thrall to their maniacal leader (another superb performance from Alice Krige). These denizens have to contend with a darkness that falls intermittently across the town. The advent of this darkness falling is the eerie sound of a huge warning siren (another piece of WW2 imagery) that beckons anyone in the town, to race for the sanctuary of the town's church, the only place that can withstand the darkness. This darkness is home to all sorts of Lovecraftian monstrousities. These move slowly but with terrible purpose, and the fate of anyone caught by them is not a pleasant one...Into this hellish world come Rose and her daughter Sharon, the latter having been tormented by dreams of Silent Hill, a place that she has seemingly never visited. Rose is played by Radha Mitchell (the pilot in Pitch Black) who turns in another strong performance. Accompanying Rose is a female motorcycle cop whose initial suspicions regarding Rose and her daughter are quickly displaced by the desperate struggle for survival that both she and Rose have to undertake in Silent hill, all the while searching for the now missing Sharon. Rose learns that her daughter is the 'good' part of another girl - Alessa who was horribly burnt by Krige's bunch of fanatics for being 'evil'. The 'evil' part of Alessa has remained in te town and has become the demonic entity behind the darkness, all the time looking for revenge on her tormentors - Krige and her fanatical following.This is a film of stunningly surreal imagery and horror images that in my opinion are very Lovecraftian, in fact superbly so. The viewer is left with two possible scenarios for the Silent Hill existence:Firstly, Rose, Sharon, and Officer Bennett died when their vehicles crashed and that Silent Hill is some purgatorial plane between Heaven and Hell which also houses the spirits of Krige and her followers.Secondly that the town is another plane of existence and that Sharon, Rose, and Officer Bennet have all been summoned to by Alessa to be part of her final confontation with Krige and her cohorts.The otherwordly scenarios of both possibilties are underlined by the desperate and increasingly futile attempts of Rose's husband (played by Sean Bean)as he wanders round an empty Silent Hill with another policeman in tow, sensing his wife is near but never able to communicate with her. The film's final sequence only serves to underline this.Silent Hill is a film of imagination and stunning surreal imagery. Whether you are a fan of the games or like me just wish to see a very original horror film, then Cristopher Gans delivers in spades, superbly moving on from 'the Brotherhood Of The Wolf.'Highly recommended.",5,Deserves more credit than it has been given,1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,3590,"['have', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'so', 'approached', 'film', 'completely', 'neutral', 'mindset', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'reviews', 'prior', 'seeing', 'was', 'film', 'Cristopher', 'Gans', 'director', 'remarkable', 'original', ""'Brotherhood"", 'Wolf', 'such', 'most', 'recent', 'outing', 'deserved', 'attention', 'nutshell', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'either.Silent', 'Hill', 'taken', 'game', 'same', 'title', 'scenario', 'abandoned', 'town', 'mountainous', 'terrain', 'been', 'abandoned', 'inhabitants', 'massive', 'underground', 'fires', 'are', 'burning', 'perpetually', 'fed', 'subterranean', 'coal', 'seams', 'sky', 'grey', 'due', 'smoke', 'fires', 'eerie', 'stunning', 'visual', 'disturbingly', 'like', 'scenes', 'Auschwitz', 'ash', 'continuously', 'sky', 'snow', 'inhabitants', 'town', 'are', 'congregation', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'totally', 'thrall', 'maniacal', 'leader', 'superb', 'performance', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'denizens', 'have', 'contend', 'darkness', 'intermittently', 'town', 'advent', 'darkness', 'falling', 'eerie', 'sound', 'huge', 'warning', 'siren', 'piece', 'WW2', 'imagery', 'beckons', 'anyone', 'town', 'race', 'sanctuary', 'town', 'church', 'only', 'place', 'can', 'withstand', 'darkness', 'darkness', 'home', 'sorts', 'Lovecraftian', 'monstrousities', 'move', 'slowly', 'terrible', 'purpose', 'fate', 'anyone', 'caught', 'not', 'pleasant', 'one', 'hellish', 'world', 'come', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'latter', 'having', 'been', 'tormented', 'dreams', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'place', 'seemingly', 'never', 'visited', 'Rose', 'played', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'pilot', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'who', 'strong', 'performance', 'Accompanying', 'Rose', 'female', 'motorcycle', 'cop', 'initial', 'suspicions', 'regarding', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'are', 'quickly', 'displaced', 'desperate', 'struggle', 'survival', 'Rose', 'have', 'undertake', 'Silent', 'hill', 'while', 'searching', 'now', 'missing', 'Sharon', 'Rose', 'daughter', ""'good"", 'part', 'girl', 'Alessa', 'who', 'was', 'horribly', 'burnt', 'Krige', 'bunch', 'fanatics', 'being', ""'evil"", ""'evil"", 'part', 'Alessa', 'remained', 'te', 'town', 'become', 'demonic', 'entity', 'darkness', 'time', 'looking', 'revenge', 'tormentors', 'Krige', 'fanatical', 'following.This', 'film', 'stunningly', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'horror', 'images', 'opinion', 'are', 'very', 'Lovecraftian', 'fact', 'superbly', 'so', 'viewer', 'left', 'two', 'possible', 'scenarios', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'existence', 'Firstly', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'Officer', 'Bennett', 'died', 'when', 'vehicles', 'crashed', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'purgatorial', 'plane', 'Heaven', 'Hell', 'also', 'houses', 'spirits', 'Krige', 'followers.Secondly', 'town', 'plane', 'existence', 'Sharon', 'Rose', 'Officer', 'Bennet', 'have', 'been', 'summoned', 'Alessa', 'be', 'part', 'final', 'confontation', 'Krige', 'cohorts.The', 'otherwordly', 'scenarios', 'possibilties', 'are', 'underlined', 'desperate', 'increasingly', 'futile', 'attempts', 'Rose', 'husband', 'played', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'round', 'empty', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'policeman', 'tow', 'sensing', 'wife', 'never', 'able', 'communicate', 'film', 'final', 'sequence', 'only', 'underline', 'this.Silent', 'Hill', 'film', 'imagination', 'stunning', 'surreal', 'imagery', 'are', 'fan', 'games', 'just', 'wish', 'see', 'very', 'original', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'Cristopher', 'Gans', 'delivers', 'spades', 'superbly', 'moving', ""'the"", 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', ""'Highly"", 'recommended']",N/A

1001657,A2F7PEA3G37YDT,B000GCFO08,dylan21484nj,"[2, 2]","When a young girl named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) suffers from dangerous bouts of sleepwalking, her adopted mother Rose (Radha Mitchell) brings her to Silent Hill against the wishes of her husband Chris (Sean Bean). Drawn to the mysterious town by Sharon's dreams, they arrive to find that Silent Hill has been abandoned for many years due to an underground mine fire. Ignoring the warnings, they enter the town anyway, but Rose crashes her car and is knocked unconscious. She awakes to find that Sharon has disappeared, and Rose must venture through a town that seems to shift between alternate dimensions of ash-covered wasteland and rusted-metal nightmare, avoiding bizarre creatures along the way to find her daughter and uncover the truth behind the strange town.One thing has to be said about Silent Hill - it looks incredible. It perfectly captures the visual aesthetic of the video games that the film is based upon. Unfortunately, the story isn't as impressive. Like most movies made from a video game, the film's story seems to share passing similaririties with the game, but that's usually where the similarities end. The filmmakers typically decide to tell a different story, an approach that is understandable yet disappointing. Here, the film's plot seems weakly strung together, making it hard to follow for long stretches and leaving you wondering what is really going on. And to make matters worse, a huge chunk of exposition that finally explains everything is dropped like a bomb late in the film, leaving the storytelling feeling unbalanced.Another element that felt odd was the subplot of Chris' search for Rose and Sharon. He follows them to Silent Hill, but he never enters the town's alternate ash and rust dimensions, remaining in reality while finding hints and clues to Sharon's past and the town's dark history. Perhaps if the unraveling of the film's backstory was addressed in the main plot instead of the subplot, the film would feel more cohesive.One aspect of note is that the film's cast is largely female, from Rose, Sharon, police officer Cybil (Laurie Holden), and cult leader Christabella (Alice Krige). The male characters seem to be relegated to the subplot and feel unimportant. Not that there's anything wrong with a largely female cast, it just seems abnormal for a film based on a video game, where the target audience is comprised mostly by the young males who play the games. The lead characters in video games are typically male, since that makes it easier for the male players to identify with. There are the exceptions like Tomb Raider's Lara Croft, but those characters usually had the allure of sex appeal to go along with the role as the lead character. At no point are the characters in Silent Hill presented in a sexual manner, so its cast of largely female lead characters is rather unusual.In all, Silent Hill is a film that looks beautiful and tries to take its source material seriously though not strictly adhering to it, and for those reasons alone make it one of the better video game movies out there. But unfortunately, its loosely-weaved plot makes it difficult to follow and prevents the film from being one of the better horror films in recent memory.",3,Welcome to Silent Hill,1278892800,"07 12, 2010",2010,3216,"['When', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Sharon', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'suffers', 'dangerous', 'bouts', 'sleepwalking', 'adopted', 'mother', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'wishes', 'husband', 'Chris', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Drawn', 'mysterious', 'town', 'Sharon', 'dreams', 'arrive', 'find', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'been', 'abandoned', 'many', 'years', 'due', 'underground', 'mine', 'fire', 'Ignoring', 'warnings', 'enter', 'town', 'anyway', 'Rose', 'car', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'find', 'Sharon', 'disappeared', 'Rose', 'must', 'venture', 'town', 'shift', 'alternate', 'dimensions', 'ash-covered', 'wasteland', 'rusted-metal', 'nightmare', 'avoiding', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'way', 'find', 'daughter', 'uncover', 'truth', 'strange', 'town.One', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'incredible', 'perfectly', 'visual', 'aesthetic', 'video', 'games', 'film', 'based', 'Unfortunately', 'story', ""n't"", 'as', 'impressive', 'most', 'movies', 'made', 'video', 'game', 'film', 'story', 'share', 'passing', 'similaririties', 'game', 'usually', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'filmmakers', 'typically', 'decide', 'tell', 'different', 'story', 'approach', 'understandable', 'yet', 'disappointing', 'Here', 'film', 'plot', 'weakly', 'strung', 'together', 'making', 'hard', 'follow', 'long', 'stretches', 'leaving', 'wondering', 'what', 'really', 'going', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'huge', 'chunk', 'exposition', 'finally', 'everything', 'dropped', 'bomb', 'late', 'film', 'leaving', 'storytelling', 'feeling', 'unbalanced.Another', 'element', 'felt', 'odd', 'was', 'subplot', 'Chris', 'search', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'never', 'town', 'alternate', 'ash', 'rust', 'dimensions', 'remaining', 'reality', 'finding', 'hints', 'clues', 'Sharon', 'past', 'town', 'dark', 'history', 'Perhaps', 'unraveling', 'film', 'backstory', 'was', 'addressed', 'main', 'plot', 'instead', 'subplot', 'film', 'would', 'feel', 'more', 'cohesive.One', 'aspect', 'note', 'film', 'cast', 'largely', 'female', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'police', 'officer', 'Cybil', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'cult', 'leader', 'Christabella', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'male', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'relegated', 'subplot', 'feel', 'unimportant', 'Not', 'anything', 'wrong', 'largely', 'female', 'cast', 'just', 'abnormal', 'film', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'where', 'target', 'audience', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'young', 'males', 'who', 'play', 'games', 'lead', 'characters', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'typically', 'male', 'easier', 'male', 'players', 'identify', 'are', 'exceptions', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Lara', 'Croft', 'characters', 'usually', 'had', 'allure', 'sex', 'appeal', 'go', 'along', 'role', 'lead', 'character', 'point', 'are', 'characters', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'presented', 'sexual', 'manner', 'cast', 'largely', 'female', 'lead', 'characters', 'rather', 'unusual.In', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'film', 'beautiful', 'take', 'source', 'material', 'seriously', 'not', 'strictly', 'adhering', 'reasons', 'alone', 'make', 'one', 'better', 'video', 'game', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'unfortunately', 'loosely-weaved', 'plot', 'difficult', 'follow', 'film', 'being', 'one', 'better', 'horror', 'films', 'recent', 'memory']",N/A

I own all of them, as well as their soundtracks. I play them over and over again, and will continue to be a die hard fan for the rest of my life.With this beinmg said, there were certain elements of the movie that I did not like.For example, I LOVE how they did Pyramid head, but did not like the ( SPOILER) scene where he ripped the chick's skin off; Pyramid Head in the game is much more about presence than him actually being a slasher ( though he carries a mean sword). In the movie, it seemed like they just wanted some shock value and so put that seen in ( and the chick that plays the girl isn't that good).Also, the plot really does vary from the original game, and I did not like how Alyssa's mother was not the bad person, but was sort of 'gray' and not 'black'. Christabella was the villain ( and was well acted, and so was Deborah Ungar, but still). This was irritating, and on top of that the cult Christabella was a part of differs from the cult at the root of Silent Hill.Look, Radha mitchell was great, and the rest of the cast as well.

From the very beginning of the movie, references from the Silent Hill games are very noticeable.  The car journey, the crash, the missing daughter and the wondering into the haunted town to find clues.  The story is very basic and takes the plot directly from the first Silent Hill game.  The CGI and special effects I found were very good, with weird and horrible creatures looking very impressive.  Throughout, this movie is very entertaining and violent but far from scary.  The movie's soundtrack is very good as it sits perfectly with the tone and atmosphere of the movie.Overall, I would have liked this movie to be more frightening and eerie but its entertaining value still holds my attention with a good story and impressive laugh-out-loud climax.The critics have under rated this movie way too much, as they don't understand what Silent Hill is all about.

I also love this type of horror: weird monsters, bizarre nightmarish settings, and no logic to be found anywhere. The game was inspired by this type of horror: the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Clive Barker and Stephen King, Barker's Hellraiser, Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm Street, Adrian Lyne's Jacob's Ladder and probably Italian goremasters such as Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. So that's what you're in for with Silent Hill. You're either a fan of this type of stuff, or you're not. Personally, I love it. Give me monsters and creatures over serial killers and slashers any day. Surreal horror (or fantasy horror) is by far the most interesting horror subgenre to me.We have a very atmospheric, creepy, story-driven, very cinematic game which would seemingly be perfect for a movie adaptation. We have a director, Christophe Gans, who is a big fan of the game and downright passionate about making the movie. It would seem that the movie is in the right hands. However, the results are unfortunately very uneven. While unable to break the long-running videogame movie curse, Silent Hill stills ends up being a very worthwhile movie for certain viewers. That would be fans of the videogame and/or fans of surreal Clive Barker-esque horror. Director Gans has done a remarkable job. The movie looks amazing. The production design and cinematography are top-notch, recreating the look and feel of the game perfectly. The ash snowfall, the deserted streets, the ubiquitous fog, even the wild camera angles. In fact, the first half of Silent Hill is so good that the second half is immensely disappointing in comparison. I think the filmmakers got too concerned with faithfully adapting the game that they gave little consideration to plot and dialogue. As in the games, the story is oblique and often incomprehensible. However, what makes the movie worthwhile are the strong points: creepy atmosphere, awesome bizarre monsters and lots of blood and gore.However, as I said before the movie is far from perfect. Some of the dialogue is downright horrible, some of the acting is pretty bad, some of the CG effects are less than stellar, and of course the story makes very little sense. For me, those flaws did not detract from the viewing experience. I still enjoyed the movie immensely because of what it gets right. Some will be able to overlook the many flaws and enjoy the good stuff, others won't and will probably hate the movie. A lot of viewers will probably leave the movie saying ""What the @#$*?"" But at most, Silent Hill should (like the game) find a devoted cult following. I really want to see a sequel, because there is so much potential here that the movie didn't quite live up to and I would love to see more monsters, more Pyramid Head and more Darkness. Hopefully the sequel will correct the first movie's flaws. I do hope that Christophe Gans will return for the second film and hopefully, with a better script, it will live up to the enormous potential of the game's concept. But until then I will just enjoy the movie. I am very much looking forward to the DVD release.So for fans of the game, do check out the movie. For fans of surreal fantasy-horror, check it out. Anyone else may want to proceed with caution.",4,"Creepy, bizarre, and twisted... yet very flawed",1150329600,"06 15, 2006",2006,3336,"['liked', 'movie', 'lot', 'may', 'result', 'fact', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'also', 'love', 'type', 'horror', 'weird', 'monsters', 'bizarre', 'nightmarish', 'settings', 'logic', 'be', 'found', 'anywhere', 'game', 'was', 'inspired', 'type', 'horror', 'works', 'H.P', 'Lovecraft', 'Clive', 'Barker', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Barker', 'Hellraiser', 'Wes', 'Craven', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'Adrian', 'Lyne', 'Jacob', 'Ladder', 'probably', 'Italian', 'goremasters', 'such', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'Lucio', 'Fulci', 'what', ""'re"", 'Silent', 'Hill', ""'re"", 'fan', 'type', 'stuff', ""'re"", 'not', 'Personally', 'love', 'Give', 'monsters', 'creatures', 'serial', 'killers', 'slashers', 'day', 'Surreal', 'horror', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'far', 'most', 'interesting', 'horror', 'subgenre', 'me.We', 'have', 'very', 'atmospheric', 'creepy', 'story-driven', 'very', 'cinematic', 'game', 'would', 'seemingly', 'be', 'perfect', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'have', 'director', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'who', 'big', 'fan', 'game', 'downright', 'passionate', 'making', 'movie', 'would', 'seem', 'movie', 'right', 'hands', 'However', 'results', 'are', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'uneven', 'unable', 'break', 'long-running', 'videogame', 'movie', 'curse', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'up', 'being', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'certain', 'viewers', 'would', 'be', 'fans', 'videogame', 'and/or', 'fans', 'surreal', 'Clive', 'Barker-esque', 'horror', 'Director', 'Gans', 'done', 'remarkable', 'job', 'movie', 'amazing', 'production', 'design', 'cinematography', 'are', 'top-notch', 'recreating', 'look', 'feel', 'game', 'perfectly', 'ash', 'snowfall', 'deserted', 'streets', 'ubiquitous', 'fog', 'even', 'wild', 'camera', 'angles', 'fact', 'first', 'half', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'so', 'good', 'second', 'half', 'immensely', 'disappointing', 'comparison', 'think', 'filmmakers', 'got', 'too', 'concerned', 'faithfully', 'adapting', 'game', 'gave', 'little', 'consideration', 'plot', 'dialogue', 'games', 'story', 'oblique', 'often', 'incomprehensible', 'However', 'what', 'movie', 'worthwhile', 'are', 'strong', 'points', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'awesome', 'bizarre', 'monsters', 'lots', 'blood', 'gore.However', 'said', 'movie', 'far', 'perfect', 'dialogue', 'downright', 'horrible', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', 'CG', 'effects', 'are', 'less', 'stellar', 'course', 'story', 'very', 'little', 'sense', 'flaws', 'did', 'not', 'detract', 'viewing', 'experience', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'immensely', 'what', 'right', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'overlook', 'many', 'flaws', 'enjoy', 'good', 'stuff', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'will', 'probably', 'hate', 'movie', 'lot', 'viewers', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'movie', 'saying', 'What', '@', '*', 'most', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'should', 'game', 'find', 'devoted', 'cult', 'following', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'sequel', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'here', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'live', 'up', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'monsters', 'more', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'more', 'Darkness', 'Hopefully', 'sequel', 'will', 'correct', 'first', 'movie', 'flaws', 'do', 'hope', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'will', 'return', 'second', 'film', 'hopefully', 'better', 'script', 'will', 'live', 'up', 'enormous', 'potential', 'game', 'concept', 'then', 'will', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'am', 'very', 'much', 'looking', 'forward', 'DVD', 'release.So', 'fans', 'game', 'do', 'check', 'out', 'movie', 'fans', 'surreal', 'fantasy-horror', 'check', 'out', 'Anyone', 'else', 'may', 'want', 'proceed', 'caution']",N/A

Just from the trailer and set shots I had seen it looked like it was turning out to be a great film.After seeing it last night I can say I was not dissapointed. It's been awhile since I played the games but it was amazing just how many little details, camera angles and such I remember from the game that were translated into the movie.The performers they hired to do the nurses and those other creatures (the ones that look like they are trying to break out of their own skin, its been awhile can't remember their names) did a great job in mimicking the movements of their videogame counterparts. Pyramid Head was also extremely cool and well done.The only thing I would have changed would be to lessen the amount of screen time for Sean Bean's character and devote more to Silent Hill/Darkness scenes. But I understand that is character was a good way to help viewers who were not fans of the video game understant a bit about the 'Multiple' Silent Hills.All in all great film and definately the best video game adaption yet. Those who have not played the video games may feel a bit confused about things in the movie, but those who have played the games will likely come out very satisfied.Silent Hill opened in nearly 3,000 theatres.

1001664,A4MF6S6TSGS8T,B000GCFO08,F. Gwin,"[0, 1]","First of all, I would like to say that I love bad horror movies. After seeing the second movie I was expecting this movie to be just as bad, but it wasn't. This movie actually had some things going for it.The Good:The camera work is superb, I never really felt like it was awkward or bad in any way.The acting is, for the most part, very good. I felt like the main actors really got into their roles and played them to the best of their abilities.The CGI is very good. When the town falls under darkness I really enjoyed seeing the walls flake away.The monsters, especially Pyramid Head, are very nicely done and help withthe atmosphere, which was also very nice for the first half of the movie. Even though this is a short movie I was (at first) able to believe that there was more to Silent Hill than I was seeing onscreen.The Bad:The writing is...well...if you've seen it you'll get what I mean even though it might not have occurred you. The writing consistently plays the victim of plot convenience. The first time our main character encounters monsters, she has the opportunity to run away but gets confused and runs the wrong way. She then stumbles as the monsters converge on her, but wait! It just so happens that the monsters just disappear! This happens every single time the main characters get into a major situation in this movie. The monsters trap them, but then they disappear because that's what happens. They never fully explain this either. All we know by the end of the movie is that some form of praying to an unidentified god by some random cult happens and then the bad stuff just disappears, though even this isn't fully put together for us. This doesn't help the atmosphere later in the movie either, since once we know that the darkness doesn't have a very good explanation it just feels random and un-scary. More on the plot conveniences below.I'm not sure if I could classify this one as monsters or camera work, so I'm just going to call it catering to fanboys in the wrong way. Anyone who knows anything about Silent Hill knows that Silent Hill was scary because of that ""I wonder if something is behind me"" sort of feeling it gives you at all times. This movie seems to take this approach at first, but then just leaves it in the dust. The only genuinely scary part of the film is a part where our protagonist, Rose, locks herself in a bathroom and finds a dead guy in a bathroom stall. I won't say what happens, but the atmosphere is tremendous. It then screws this great atmosphere over only a minute later! A monster appears, and while this in itself is great, the camera stays focused on the monster repeatedly. The camera angles themselves were fantastic, but the protagonist just stands there and looks at it so that the writers can cater to Silent Hill fanboys by keeping a ""scary"" monster on screen. Rose then just runs out the door (that was just locked?) and leaves. It's not that hard guys! Just quickly show the monster (not showing us what it looks like in detail so that we are even more scared of what it might be), give us a sense that she is being chased by it, and make us really scared with those great camera angles that you keep using! Simple!This movie also sports the most useless character in any movie I have ever seen: the cop. Notice that I did not say she was a forgettable character, but that she was just completely useless. She is literally forced into the plot on many occasions and near the end does some of the most stupid things imaginable. She notices Rose's car at a gas station and sees her daughter inside of it. She asks Rose is everything is okay. Then she doesn't just follow Rose to Silent Hill, she tries to pull her over on the way there! WHY? This is never explained and all we know from this point is that the cop doesn't like Rose, until she does like Rose, and then she conveniently likes Rose. Even if Rose had just met her, and then the cop just found her suspicious and followed her to Silent Hill that would be better. But there was literally no reason to forced her into the plot the way the writers did. The only thing she does in the whole movie that is worth anything is when she pulls Rose out of the way of the darkness when Rose was (conveniently) to stupid to move out of the way. She crashes her police motorcycle and receives only a small scratch above the eye (this might sound silly, but if you watch the movie you'll see how stupid this is based on the MASSIVE headgear she is wearing on her head) and she isn't hurt otherwise. She also gets acid sprayed all over her front, and even though she takes off her headgear and nice leather jacket (just because it's a leather jacket doesn't mean that a motorcycle crash wouldn't damage it...) but her face just lucky avoided the acid (that was everywhere around her face...).  She later easily fights off three cultists, before (conveniently) not being able to fight well anymore. I'm not even joking. She doesn't just take a hit to the face and get disorientated or something, she just pulls the most USELESS ""I'll stay behind"" move I've ever seen, and then (conveniently) loses both the desire and ability to fight. WHY? She doesn't even slow the cultists down because THEY WEREN'T EVEN ABLE TO CHASE ROSE!I think I've said enough. This movie suffers from an extreme case of plot convenience and really doesn't make sense in a lot of places. It really kills the atmosphere later in the movie and it's a shame that the writers decided to continue the same story line in the newer one.",2,Good and Bad,1353283200,"11 19,

Mumbling about ""Silent Hill"" near a very treacherous waterfall certainly is enough to bring Radha Mitchell and an extremely miscast (and underused) Sean Bean at ends with each other in how their adopted daughter is to be treated.After a few internet searches (does anyone still use Yahoo! or MSN for their internet scouring anymore?) Radha comes to a story describing the tragedy in Silent Hill, WV.  Going there, she hopes, will bring her daughter out of the ""New Millenium Creepy Child character trait"" funk.It doesn't.  We start, then further treading down the same ""New Millenium Creepy Child character"" path...chasing a girl that doesn't talk, but darts in and out of dilapidated, rundown rooms and condemned buildings.  All the while, the exasperated parent vainly looks for them.The female police officer is wearing the tightest leather outfit I've ever seen without having to pay a cover charge and listening to Emo or KMFDM all night.  My first thought?  Whoa..Joan Jett is in here!  :)  Alas, it wasn't.  Unfortunately, she's tied to a stake and made to feel like the other side of a human pig roast.Silent Hill is creepy.  Intensely creepy.  The sirens are fantastically eerie...Definitely something you don't want to hear in real life. The monsters-especially Triangle Head-are straight out of a Lovecraft/Dali dream montage; or at least from a Wes Carpenter movie.**SPOILERS AHEAD**By the time Alice Krige (the busiest plain jane in movies) hits the screen, the plot starts sliding to a videogame plot (memorize the floorplan, defeat the monster in his lair), which pretty much means all hell is going to break loose.  It had me until the time the cop was accused of being a witch.  After that, the reveal (done as a very effective set of flashbacks) is little more than a revenge story; which tends to lose it's credibility to some extent.  Again, as someone that wasn't familiar with the games, it was fun to know that a lot of the beasties and clues were taken directly from the games.Not many movies adapted from other media (books, videogames, Podcasts) are going to be as faithful as fanboys would like.  Think if George Lucas had published the Star Wars episodes as books prior to 1977.  Remember..Han Solo was supposed to be a cross between Greedo and Chewy, if I remember right.""Silent Hill"" certainly has my attention and I will definitely be placing the DVD on my Christma...er, sorry, Winter Solstice Holiday Wish List...

Sean Bean was great as the husband, but his role could have been played by anyone. They just didn't take him to his full advantage, but for as long as he was on, he was great. Being a Trek fan, I was happy to see the villain was played by actrees Alice Krige, who is the Borg Queen on Star Trek First Contact and Voyager.But like I said, the special effects are good. Not really great, some parts could have been better but it was enjoyable. For those who have never played the games may be confused by some of the things going on.

Because it has ""Unrated Version"" written all over it (it's invisible but I swear I see it) and I would hate to purchase this edition only to have an alternate version soon available.That said...This is a scary movie. There is no way around that fact. The film does deliver on the heebie-jeebies. For proof of this look no further than the burning babies in the dark alley. They had a eerie shriek and their relentless chase after the heroine was just down right creepy. Even knowing that she was the central character of the story did not take away from the overall ""frightfest"" those demonic infants had.But... there is more. Even for his short amount of screen time... Pyramid Head ruled when it came to delivering the dread. Seeing that deformity carrying around the sword bigger than my mamma and surrounded by all those bugs was nothing short of heart stopping. In reality, if something like that was after me... I'd be a wreck for sure.Then there were the faceless nurses. They were evil, creepy, and sexy to boot. Some guys wouldn't mind being trapped in a room with nurses like that... though, once the lights go on and they go all ""violent"" I'm sure a different tune would be sung.Of course, there were some downer moments as well. The little girl, when in evil mode, was just unconvincing. The ""other people"" in Silent Hill were too dirty and dark to not give the lead doubts about their mental status. She became too trusting of them too fast... as where I would have been more wary; afterall, everyhting else in Silent Hill had proven to be evil. Add to that the ending which left me saying ""Huh?"" instead of ""Oh..."" Although the climatic showdown was something you would see in a hellraiser movie... (now that was entertaining)So... I would wait just a little bit to see if there is indeed an unrated version on its way before spending the bucks on this one.

1001675,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,B000GCFO08,General Zombie,"[9, 43]","I'll mention up front that I've not actually played any of the 'Silent Hill' games.  This will doubtless make many of you think my opinions is irrelevant.  I understand your concern:  Seeing this film w/o playing the games I'm all too likely to judge it on it's own merits rather than just fawning over the fact that a game I like has been made into a movie.  And, contrary to what you may have heard, this film is plenty easy to understand w/o having played any of the games.  I suppose it could be said that the film doesn't entirely make sense, meaning that the explanations don't necessarily jibe logically with what we've been shown, but the connection we are supposed to make is generally obvious.  More to the point, I don't really give much of a damn if my horror movies make sense as long as it's got the individual horror scenes down well enough that I don't bother to look at the big picture.  Sadly, 'Silent Hill' fails in this respect, and wastes a lot of time and effort on a dull, hopelessly muddled script.I should also say that whoever put together the trailer for this movie totally deserves to win the Golden Trailer award, or whatever it is.  Nowadays the trailer making industry is in dire straits, with even good films usually having lame, distasteful trailers.  Conversely, the trailer for 'Silent Hill' actually made the film look like it had potential, and that it might actually be *gasp* good.  The 'Silent Hill' trailer is helped by the fact that it doesn't insist on showing us everything in the movie, focusing on the introductory parts of the film.  This points to how the trailer was able to trick me into thinking the movie might be good:  The introduction to the film is actually well done.  The set design is brilliant, the cinematography  quite gorgeous and the basic premise, while not utterly original, is intriguing enough.  It's the old mysterious, abandoned town premise, but that's always been one of my favorite horror setups, and this one is particularly well done, with some extra nice touches.  (Such as how the fog-thick abandoned town is near an ever-burning fire, which makes ash continually fall from the sky like snow.)Anyway, the film primarily involves Rose and her adopted daughter Sharon.  Now Sharon is a bit of a loon as far as little kids go, constantly sleepwalking and muttering about a town called Silent Hill.  Oddly enough, Rose decides to cure her of her ailment by finding this town, and, I dunno, wandering around there for a while.  Needless to say, there is a dark history behind the ghost  town (HA!), and bad stuff goes down when they arrive there.Basically, Rose and Sharon arrive there along with a lady cop who has been on their trail, and Sharon disappears, leaving Rose to wander around for the next hour or so.  Again, the opening scenes in the town are powerfully atmospheric, and the early encounters with the strange, humanoid creatures that live there are fairly good, but at about the 45 minute mark things start to fall apart.  It's really quite remarkable, how from that point on the film gets almost continually worse, until we arrive at the tediously overlong expository flashback stuffed late in the film and finally the tragically weak climax.Again, the film is severely hampered by the lame script.  The dialogue is nothing but cliches and banalities.  (I might as well cite the two particular lines that always get mentioned:  ""Something terrible happened here"", and ""There must've been a fire"" [said upon entering a burnt-out husk of a building].  Those may not be the exact lines, but you get the gist of it.  Rest assured, the movie is packed with junk like that.  More significantly, the script has got no sense of pace to it and the various explanations to the horror prove far too mundane considering the setup.  The pacing problems come from the general lack of occurrence between the midpoint of the film and the climax.  We just have things explained to us, uninteresting things, many of which are already known by the audience.  Furthermore, there is a subplot involving Rose's husbands attempt to track her down which is unnecessarily drawn out and poorly intergrated into the central narrative.Alright, now just a few random gripes:  Pyramid Head = Lame.  No other way to put it.  Crazy Lady played by Alice Krige = Way silly and over the top.  Also, this film works on the whole evil/scary child angle, and it just can't pull it off, and if you mess that up you look really silly.  And, ooh, don't get me started about the horrible CGI gore.  I never much care for CGI gore, but this is easily the worst I've seen in a film that actually got a theatrical release.  This is particularly prominent in the terrible, overblown finale.  It's just stupid, formless CGI spectacle, further weakened by the fact that the main characters of the film are generally on the sideline of the situation, so it barely even matters to us what is going on.  (Well, this would matter if we actually cared about these characters, anyway.)  Finally, most of the horror scenes are curiously unaffecting.  I don't even mean that they aren't scary, though they aren't, but they don't even really connect with the viewer on any level, and lack any intensity at all.  They're just a mild curiosity.  (Again, this less true of the earlier horror scenes, but it's never more than mildly unnerving.)Anyway, I can't say I wasn't more or less entertained by the film, but I'm just easily entertained.  It's got its moments, yeah, but it all comes together as a whole lotta nothin'.Grade: C-(P.S.  One last note, I did like how at one point Rose basically collapses on the ground and cries for a while.  People don't do that nearly enough in horror movies.)",2,"Great visuals, lame everything else",1145836800,"04 24, 2006",2006,5726,"[""'ll"", 'mention', 'up', 'front', ""'ve"", 'not', 'actually',

It's like the director filmed way more than what made it into the final cut and lots of scenes were trimmed, or the editor was given bad direction from the director, or the editor just sucks. The movie is choppy, goes from being slow and drawn out to crammed with content. It seems like a three hour movie or couple of episodes of a show smashed into a two hour slot. Some of the visuals are really good, some not so much. The acting is not great, the story is convoluted and only makes sense in about the last 20 minutes of the movie at which point I felt unmoved since I didn't care about any of the characters. There is no beginning to this movie, it just starts and not much is explained like you are starting the second episode of a tv show having missed the first episode. Just not a very good movie, and yet it's still better than most video game movies. On Blu-Ray it looks really good. Since a lot of the film is dark, the black levels are deep and never murky, most shots are crisp in detail and when color is used, its vibrant and looks really good. The movie looks better than it is, the sequel does look better but I just can't imagine doing more with this series. Christophe Gans did an amazing job with  Brotherhood Of The Wolf and his upcoming Beauty And The Beast should be really good as well. Unfortunately his attempt at a Hollywood film is a bit flaccid and I can only assume those Hollywood Dougs had a big influence on the script and final cut of the film.

A plot that revolves around an estranged couple Rose Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) both at different ends in how to care their sick daughter.  Ask for the comments that males were an afterthougth well there is a lot of testosterone in ""Silent Hill"" Cybil Bennett, the cop , is very a tomboy figure.  Rose herself often acts irrationally without thinking and breaking the rules.  Contrary to the belief of a few minority Silent Hill is a combination of male and female characters.Now as for the differences in the game, I've played the whole series from beginning to end including the first game and while there are differences the movie does remain pretty faithful  to the game. In the game Harry Mason was the lead, in the movie Rose was in the lead and looking for her missing daughter. The setup is also the same, Silent Hill has been abandoned for years but a portal of reality is now inhibited by monsters , evil spirits and other abominations. Equally the setup of atmosphere will be very familiar to game fans. The town is depicted as cold, gritty, snowy,  mysterious and evil.  There are  a lot of dark and grainy scenes that serve as a good hint that something horrible is about to come on screen followed by a lot of shrieks and high pitch squeals to add to the mayhem!!! There are classic horror gags as well like when Cybil being approached by the limbless zombies of Silent Hill is still laughing barking out orders hoping they'll stop coming after her.Acting wise everyone was pretty solid here. I would have loved to see more of Sean Bean whose a  great actor but Radha does a good job especially for the fact that she mainly plays unmemorable supporting roles in movies led by leading actors.  Jodelle Ferland is great as Sharon Silva and her alter ego Alessa.Of course you don't have to be familiar with the game to love the movie, the movie has classic horror elements and angles that will make everything pretty familiar but of course you gain a great appreciation if knowing the game you'd see that French Director Christopher Christophe Gans did not let fans of the game down. That's the biggest bottom line after all the hype a lot of fans expected this to be another catastrophic piece of garbage like all of Uwe Boll's movie but thank God it did not.

I won't give away any plots/ spoilers in this review, that for the viewers to enjoy.  How to describe this movie without giving away too much favors or details?  How about the bizarre and creepy feeling when you first watched the ""the Ring"".  The survive horror of ""28 days"".  The ""what is going on factor"" of Mulhlland Dr.  An independence directing style of an Indies type movie with a touch of ""12 Monkeys.""The mood of the movie starts slowly and keep you wondering throughout the film.  I though the acting was perfect, maybe the motorcycle policewoman character is questionable.  I glad there were no superstar actors/actresses that stood out.  Silent Hill would not work with overacting actors, which would take away from the mood of the storyline.  The background music and scenes were great; it felt like being in a dream or some parallel universe.  The actions really balance out with the mood of the story.  There are no cheesy or Hollywood's cool styles directing here.  I could see why some conservative movies goers and religious fanatics might give this a low ranking.For gamers-This is the best game to movie adaptation so far.  A 6 out of 5 for this standard.  More like movie to game adaptation.  Jolie did great for Tomb Raider, but that was really simple minded more base on a lead character.  Resident Evil's movies should have been more like Silent Hill with more actions, but those were way too cheesy.  Mario, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, D&D;, Doom were all really silly, but not Silent Hill.  They really did a great job of pulling scenes and enemies from all the Silent Hill games in the series and mixing them in so well.  Watching this movie was like playing the game over again.

I was waiting for this movie to come out and blow my mind just like the games did, but instead, I stumbled upon that euphoria in another movie entitled ""Containment."" That's a different story, however. I was under the impression that Silent Hill was going to be a classic, but once I saw it, I see where it falls short. Yet, it strives to make up for what it lacks with a crisp world and a true-to-game representation of this abandoned little town with a ghastly secret.The game left a lot of the plot up to the imagination, but being a game, each player has his/her own player story anyhow. The movie tried to do the same, but failed in this area, because in a movie you follow the character, in a game, you are the character. We need sustenance! The movie would've been much more enticing had it teased my brain, and then tricked it, but gave me something solid to hold onto after it's over. That's what will make it memorable. Twist the ending, but explain it at some point during the film. Otherwise you'll leave the audience to wonder what happened, rather then revel in what could've been.But, overall, it wasn't a bad movie. There were lots of cinematic elements at work that covered up any misshapen plot holes and poor dialogue. In my opinion it's still worthy of a classic title, just not in the way I had originally imagined. So what all worked to the films benefit, and what brought it down?Atmosphere and camera work- Obviously as you've well heard by now, the visual representation of Silent Hill is ecstatic. It is probably the most accurate and most thrilling game to film atmosphere to date. If you simply wanted to experience Silent Hill in all of its creepy visual glory, then this film would be a must see. The visuals alone and the excellent camera work almost make this film a classic as is, and certainly make it one of the most intensely artistic horror films of all time. I do wish more producers would devote this kind of time and funding to their atmospheres.Blood and violence- I think that Silent Hill did extremely well with this aspect of the film. Although the game listed some severe horror-scapes that didn't seem to be present in the film, I was generally satisfied with the proper amount of blood and gore. I will admit that I missed the scenes from the game, dripping with mutilated dead bodies strung up between wire mesh and other metal objects. The film included a few of these scenes, but probably chose to remove much of it for rating purposes.Plot- Now I know the game surfaced on a simple plot where you wreck your car and loose your daughter in this strange town, only to find out that it's overrun by a strange cult, which has the town under a grotesque plague...But the film barely managed to expand on this. Simple plots are great for games, but not movies. In-fact, you know it was either too complex, or too simple when you run through a door and enter into a bright light only to be greeted by the voice of a child, who blatantly explains the entire surface plot, and that was about all the further it went. The main character didn't even really discover anything. It was really a 2D plot, with no deep grounds for something 3 dimensional, something that allowed the audience to dig deeper into the film for meaning beyond the basic plot. You could try to dig in deeper, but at the same time, you wouldn't get much further than the surface, even with that mysterious ending.The characters- The game had characters of complex and different archetypes, which helped lead the main character through this strange little town. The movie had a slew of insignificant supporting roles compiled to simply set up the film and further the plot in any stage of events. The characters, excluding the mother and daughter, never seem to grow and change within the film. None of them, except Cybil and the mother even seems to complete a full character arch. This in turn makes them seem a little less human, more like zombies. However, they managed to include most of the key characters in the game, and at least provide them with some placement and importance with regard to the plotline. And in relation to the creatures.....(expletive deleted) I wanted more! They should've run to the police station, loaded up on mythical weapons, and rode the ""action genre"" wave for at least a mile. The game was all about killing those awesome creatures; the film was all about the atmosphere. I think we can all agree that it would've been much more exhilarating with the static from the cell phone resonating around every corner with enough creatures to build a small third-world country, and enough fire-power to take it down.Acting and dialog- Of course in a film with this type of budget, and a well-established director attached to it, we know the acting is going to be superb. I think it flew in a lot of ways, but there were a few instances where the characters crashed and burned. I'm not sure if it was just scripted poorly, or the actors were at fault, but the roles were tough-enough as-is. However, it should be mentioned again, although every review had the same note; the dialog is lacking. There are some attempts to make it philosophical and other-worldly, but in the end, it's basic. It doesn't bring you into the same type of deep thought and conversation that the Matrix slapped you with and made you question your own existence. Maybe it just wasn't supposed to be that kind of film, but again, we go back to the surface plot, and the dialog never strays from the basics of human interaction.In the end, I feel that Silent Hill was a good movie. It was definitely worth seeing in the theatre if you got the chance, and I am sure going to buy the DVD at some point. Being a fan of the game (I own the entire series), it definitely excels in some areas and falls short in others. With the addition of a few changes, it would've been an instant classic, but I feel it might just fall short. In any case, it's worth seeing, and you won't be disappointed by the set-work.",4,Silent Hill is your worst fear....,1161648000,"10 24, 2006",2006,6042,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'what', 'can', 'say', 'was',

The audience moves along with Rose in her search for her daughter and experiences with her the supposedly hellish remains of Silent Hill.  Big on special effects and small on plot, ""Silent Hill"" is an over the top mess that is so far-fetched and lacking in discipline that the experienced horror movie fan loses interest by movie's end.  At first, it seems like ""Silent Hill"" is a nice concept, but the movie does not know what to do with itself.  The result is a maze of barbed wire, cages, and silly special effects which drown the movie in its own vomit.  Stylish movies like Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"" are able to pull off the style over substance technique attempted in ""Silent Hill"", but ""Silent Hill"" ultimately has no style and completely fails in this regard.  Moreover, the manifestations used in ""Silent Hill"" are overdone, overused and essentially comical, indicative of an expressive yet sloppy and heartless attempt at a horror movie which mistakenly and ironically banks on its incoherentness to save the day.  One-half of a star for the concept and the special effects, and while special effects really aren't my thing, I find them especially annoying when the movie has nothing to hang its hat on at the end of the day, and is executed as badly as ""Silent Hill"" was.

1001689,A1YH43NAKPLMYR,B000GCFO08,ICWiener,"[1, 1]","Yes this is one of those movies based on a video game, so what?.. Almost all the movies are based on books, which is basically someone imagination. I would classify this as a horror movie, and boy is there horror. I judge a movie by more than just a plot, I cannot stand people who tell me about a movie, or make an online review, and talk about how great the plot is and historical significance and bla, bla.. and then when I watch it I cannot get over the fact that either makeup of the actors is overdone, not good enough, or when they put the Wrong looking actor for the role. i.e. Steven Seagal as Superman.. get it?... totally screws up the movie for me..Now, this movie may not have the greatest most interesting plot (its very short) but, IMO, EVERYTHING else is pretty much spot on. One of the other reasons why I just dont go to the movies anymore, is cause all of the movie these days, whether its horror,thriller,comedy, are ALL predictable, which just screws up my interest in the movie itself. Also I could say the same thing for the MUSIC, I freaking hate it when the movie is interesting but the music just messes everything up, or the special effects, or acting,..One of other things that keeps me watching thru the whole thing (talking about any movie) is the imagination of the writers. Especially these days with the CG animations, the producers have just about used up all the moves,sets,,etc... possible, which IMO makes it boring for me.. ie. another bank robbery movie, another horror movie in a cave,... THIS movie is nothing like that..It has been a while since I have seen such EPIC imagination of writers/producers. The Music was pretty much PERFECT the whole movie. The Acting was great(at least for the main characters) One thing that sort of pisses me off, is when the extras?. background people, suck at acting, or they laugh when there is a horror scene going on, just screws the feel of the scene for me.Special effects were good, but more than the special effects the Bad guys were freaking AWESOME, they scared the crap out of me. I think I would have been even more scared if I was drunk.Bottom line, if you like movies like Lincoln,Titanic,etc... you will probably consider this movie crap. If you like movies that expand your imagination, not so predictable, horror movies that actually scare the living daylight out of you, resident Evil type survival movie, this thing is EPIC. Also the climax of this movie was by far the best hand down I've seen in a long time, hands down, the imagination is superb.p.s. If this producer actually produced the Resident Evil series they could have been some of the most EPIC movies in existence, at least for their genre, and or target audience, instead of the BUll that came out, especially the RE2,3,4.... such a shame..IMO",5,I'd give it six stars if I could...Awesome,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",2013,2801,"['Yes', 'one', 'movies', 'based', 'video', 'game', 'what', 'Almost', 'movies', 'are', 'based', 'books', 'basically', 'someone', 'imagination', 'would', 'classify', 'horror', 'movie', 'boy', 'there', 'horror', 'judge', 'movie', 'more', 'just', 'plot', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'people', 'who', 'tell', 'movie', 'make', 'online', 'review', 'talk', 'how', 'great', 'plot', 'historical', 'significance', 'bla', 'bla..', 'then', 'when', 'watch', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'makeup', 'actors', 'overdone', 'not', 'good', 'enough', 'when', 'put', 'Wrong', 'looking', 'actor', 'role', 'i.e', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Superman..', 'get', 'totally', 'up', 'movie', 'me..Now', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'greatest', 'most', 'interesting', 'plot', 'very', 'short', 'IMO', 'EVERYTHING', 'else', 'pretty', 'much', 'spot', 'One', 'other', 'reasons', 'why', 'just', 'dont', 'go', 'movies', 'anymore', 'cause', 'movie', 'days', 'horror', 'thriller', 'comedy', 'are', 'ALL', 'predictable', 'just', 'up', 'interest', 'movie', 'Also', 'could', 'say', 'same', 'thing', 'MUSIC', 'freaking', 'hate', 'when', 'movie', 'interesting', 'music', 'just', 'messes', 'everything', 'up', 'special', 'effects', 'acting', '..One', 'other', 'things', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'talking', 'movie', 'imagination', 'writers', 'Especially', 'days', 'CG', 'animations', 'producers', 'have', 'just', 'about', 'used', 'up', 'moves', 'sets', ',etc', 'possible', 'IMO', 'boring', 'me..', 'ie', 'bank', 'robbery', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'cave', 'THIS', 'movie', 'nothing', 'that..It', 'been', 'while', 'have', 'seen', 'such', 'EPIC', 'imagination', 'writers/producers', 'Music', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'PERFECT', 'whole', 'movie', 'Acting', 'was', 'great', 'least', 'main', 'characters', 'One', 'thing', 'sort', 'pisses', 'off', 'when', 'extras', 'background', 'people', 'suck', 'acting', 'laugh', 'when', 'horror', 'scene', 'going', 'just', 'feel', 'scene', 'me.Special', 'effects', 'were', 'good', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'Bad', 'guys', 'were', 'freaking', 'AWESOME', 'scared', 'crap', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'more', 'scared', 'was', 'drunk.Bottom', 'line', 'like', 'movies', 'Lincoln', 'Titanic', 'etc', 'will', 'probably', 'consider', 'movie', 'crap', 'like', 'movies', 'expand', 'imagination', 'not', 'so', 'predictable', 'horror', 'movies', 'actually', 'scare', 'living', 'daylight', 'resident', 'Evil', 'type', 'survival', 'movie', 'thing', 'EPIC', 'Also', 'climax', 'movie', 'was', 'far', 'best', 'hand', 'down', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'down', 'imagination', 'superb.p.s', 'producer', 'actually', 'produced', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'series', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'EPIC', 'movies', 'existence', 'least', 'genre', 'target', 'audience', 'instead', 'BUll', 'came', 'out', 'especially', 'RE2,3,4', 'shame..IMO']",N/A

While far from a perfect film, the imaginative visuals and the atmosphere of Silent Hill make it a thoroughly terrifying viewing experience. Though the plot is abstract the premise is simple enough, and some indiscretions in narrative are forgivable since this is a film dealing with the supernatural. My only complaint with the story was the utterly superfluous subplot involving Rose's husband, which did nothing for the film but break up the momentum and suspense of the main storyline.I would venture that most horror buffs aren't looking for literary excellence but rather a good scare and an original idea in a genre that's become quite saturated with mediocre films.

This movie breaks the rules and thinks outside the box...and gets away with it. I think they finally got a movie that actually seems to stretch the limits of the R rating when it comes to gore. This movie drips and splatters blood.The use of CG is surprisingly low. Most creatures are really people in costumes, but it's so realistic yet strange that you almost think its CG. The movie is well-casted. Instead of, say Sarah Michelle Gellar they went on a limb and casted Radha Mitchell, whose biggest role so far has been in a minor Woody Allen movie. She carries the movie and does a fantastic job. They casted someone named Laurie Holden for the role of Cybil the cop, and she impressed me. Sean Bean as the husband is pretty much the only well-known actor in the movie, and he's basically a secondary character (though he does fine for his role).For everyone who has seen or is going to see or is thinking of seeing Silent Hill, do not go into it thinking ohhh its going to be a scary movie,,, because its not suppose to be. It's for intelligent drama based crowds who like good visuals, story line, acting, and mystery. This isn't Doom and this isn't Resident Evil, this is a well written drama/mystery that happens to be very disturbing in its visual and story. People who have not played the game go see it with an open mind and not look at it as a video game movie because even without the game it could stand on its own as a great movie.To Other Reviewers: Please, do a little research before you cut the movie off at the knees. 1st off they're not Christian fanatics, they're another cult. Secondly, not everything is movies are based on real things. Certain things can be completely fictional. The movie was made to have that dream/nightmare feel.  As for the part where they tell you the back-story, it had nothing to do with anyone not knowing what was going on. Konami as well as Sony loved it so much they didn't cut anything. That is why the movie is so long. Not to mention this is a European FILM!!!! Japanese horror, European writers and actors with few Americans (yeah some of the actors were but they don't write the film). The movie is supposed to make you sit back and go ""What the ......"" when things randomly happen...that's what Silent Hill is all about.

I don't know the game that well and I hear you had to have played the game to understand the movie. But I did watch my brother play the first game once and the film is very faithful to the game.The foggy look is well done. I don't really know much about the creatures from the game though but here they're more clunky and stupid looking than they are scary. Plus I'm not really sure what the point of them really are.  Radha Mitchell is a good actress but the script baically has it that she sees these creatures...gets scared and when they are gone she just acts casual. Some horror video games tend to be like that though lol. I think she had more to work with in Pitch Black though. She does well in horror films but I'm still not even sure why her or Sean Bean (The Fellowship of the Ring) ""who plays her husband"" are this film. Eventhough both are pretty good in it.She plays a worried mother who's worried about her adopted daughter who has nightmares about a place called Slient Hill. She thinks that bringing her there will help her daughter stop having the nightmares. She gets in an accident after a women police officer trys to make her pull over for like no reason at all. She wakes up in Silent Hill with fog all around her and her daughter nowhere to be seen. She soon realizes that she's in no ordinary place. She has to fight through weird and kinda stupid looking creatures and a crazy cult to try and find her daughter.I like Alice in Wonderland type stories where people suddenly find themselves in a strange place. I wanted to like this movie for that but it would've been better if it didn't rely on thinking that everyone played the video game. The film is still kinda well made though. I mean I played my share of video games like this and when you reach a certain part towards the end you get a sequence that explains important plot twists. This movie does that when Radha Mitchell gets further to fiding the truth about Silent Hill and I can't really say that part wasn't well done. This is probably the best of the video game movies since it is faithful to the video games. The TombRaider movies would be 4 star caliber if they were faithful to the games. But saying this is the best video game movie is still sad since it's still not a great movie.

1001707,A64PKVY0MSBWR,B000GCFO08,"J. Murdoch ""Creative Sparkplug""","[0, 1]","I don't play video games and knew nothing about the game, Silent Hill. So I watched this film with very few expectations other than what I saw in the commercials. I'm a sucker for mysteries and horror films so when Silent Hill became available on DVD, I rented it.There are elements of the plot that make this film interesting and intriguing. A mining town abandoned for 30-years because of a coal fire still burning underground sounds like an excellent setting for creepy things to occur. Plus it takes place in West Virginia in the US of A. There aren't a lot of haunted locations in the U.S.--too much money to be made by sanitizing and developing them--so this interested me.For the first 40-minutes or so, I really wanted to understand what was going on. What had happended to the town? What was so horrible. Was Rose really experiencing these things and why.Then there was about 30 minutes too long basically showing us Rose and the leather motorcycle lady cop running away from various demons. Creepy, grotesque demons to be sure. But after awhile, it got old, at least for me. It was like, ""Oh here's another scary, mutant creature making Rose scream. Whatever.""Finally, FINALLY, we find out what's going on and it's really unsatisfying. Another Japanese-style ghost/demon taking revenge on those that wronged her. In the Ring, the vengeful spirit was interesting and cool. But it's been done way too many times, not particularly well, and the novelty has worn off. It's not a bad plot device but it doesn't make up for an unoriginal story.The film gets 3-stars for kick-butt creepy atmosphere and effects. They did an amazing job making Silent Hill the setting of your worst nightmares. But the slow pacing, redundant scenes, and dirivative story line keep the movie from truly satisfying.",3,Awesome and atmospheric but lacks strong story & too long,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,1798,"['do', ""n't"", 'play', 'video', 'games', 'knew', 'nothing', 'game', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'So', 'watched', 'film', 'very', 'few', 'expectations', 'other', 'what', 'saw', 'commercials', ""'m"", 'sucker', 'mysteries', 'horror', 'films', 'so', 'when', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'became', 'available', 'DVD', 'rented', 'are', 'elements', 'plot', 'make', 'film', 'interesting', 'intriguing', 'mining', 'town', 'abandoned', '30-years', 'coal', 'fire', 'still', 'burning', 'underground', 'sounds', 'excellent', 'setting', 'creepy', 'things', 'occur', 'place', 'West', 'Virginia', 'US', 'A', 'are', ""n't"", 'lot', 'haunted', 'locations', 'U.S.', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'sanitizing', 'developing', 'so', 'interested', 'me.For', 'first', '40-minutes', 'so', 'really', 'wanted', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'What', 'had', 'happended', 'town', 'What', 'was', 'so', 'horrible', 'Was', 'Rose', 'really', 'experiencing', 'things', 'why.Then', 'there', 'was', '30', 'minutes', 'too', 'long', 'basically', 'showing', 'Rose', 'leather', 'motorcycle', 'lady', 'cop', 'running', 'away', 'various', 'demons', 'Creepy', 'grotesque', 'demons', 'be', 'sure', 'awhile', 'got', 'old', 'least', 'was', 'Oh', 'here', 'scary', 'mutant', 'creature', 'making', 'Rose', 'scream', 'Finally', 'FINALLY', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'really', 'unsatisfying', 'Japanese-style', 'ghost/demon', 'taking', 'revenge', 'wronged', 'Ring', 'vengeful', 'spirit', 'was', 'interesting', 'cool', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'particularly', 'well', 'novelty', 'worn', 'off', 'not', 'bad', 'plot', 'device', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'unoriginal', 'story.The', 'film', '3-stars', 'kick-butt', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'effects', 'did', 'amazing', 'job', 'making', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'setting', 'worst', 'nightmares', 'slow', 'pacing', 'redundant', 'scenes', 'dirivative', 'story', 'line', 'keep', 'movie', 'truly', 'satisfying']",N/A

Avery,"[2, 9]","Let me start by saying, I'm a big horror buff, both fiction and movies, and I assume Had I played the video game, I might have liked the movie more. ""silent hill"" is moody, atmospheric, and surreal. at least the first 40-50 minutes or so, but it's a muddled mess from that point on. a young mother [rose] witnesses her adopted daughter [sharon] sleepwalk and repeat the words, ""silent hill"", while exhibiting odd, suicidal behavior. drugs haven't worked so rose decides to trek off to the town of silent hill to find some answers, and begins her descent into hell. a police officer becomes curious about the mother and daughter, while they are stopped at a gas station. after leaving the service station, the officer stops them to investigate further, but rose decides to flee, with the motorcycle officer in pursuit.both the suv and the motorcycle are involved in an accident, where both women apparently lose consciousness. when rose awakens, sharon has disappeared so she sets off for silent hill on foot, along with the officer, who remains suspicious.  before reaching her destination she is told that silent hill is a an abandoned town due to an underground coal fire that still burns today. it's obvious that silent hill suffered a horrible, tragic end, but where does her daughter fit in? her husband learns that his wife has gone in search of silent hill and takes off to find her, but his role is pretty minor.I've seen many a movie and I am familiar with just about every plot device, and this one begins with a predictable scenario that should be obvious to any horror fan, reminiscent of the movie ""jacob's ladder"". but no spoilers here. rose encounters various bizarre creatures and a barely coherent woman who warns them of the town's evil. during this time, the movie is genuinely creepy and frightening, however the final half of the movie provides an explanation that is convoluted at best. many horror movies promise big things and often don't deliver. ""silent hill"" is no exception. I didn't find the end of ""silent hill"" to be ambigious at all, there are many ""clues"" throughout to explain the final scene. ""silent hill"" certainly has it's moments and is very gory and graphic, but ultimately is somewhat of a disappointment. it is  still better than many horror movies I've seen in the last few years, so ""silent hill"" should be recommended.",3,"SHOWS PROMISE, BUT.........",1156377600,"08 24, 2006",2006,2363,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', ""'m"", 'big', 'horror', 'buff', 'fiction', 'movies', 'assume', 'Had', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'might', 'have', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'silent', 'hill', 'moody', 'atmospheric', 'surreal', 'least', 'first', '40-50', 'minutes', 'so', 'muddled', 'mess', 'point', 'young', 'mother', '[', 'rose', ']', 'witnesses', 'adopted', 'daughter', '[', 'sharon', ']', 'sleepwalk', 'repeat', 'words', 'silent', 'hill', 'exhibiting', 'odd', 'suicidal', 'behavior', 'drugs', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'so', 'rose', 'decides', 'trek', 'off', 'town', 'silent', 'hill', 'find', 'answers', 'descent', 'hell', 'police', 'officer', 'curious', 'mother', 'daughter', 'are', 'stopped', 'gas', 'station', 'leaving', 'service', 'station', 'officer', 'investigate', 'further', 'rose', 'decides', 'flee', 'motorcycle', 'officer', 'suv', 'motorcycle', 'are', 'involved', 'accident', 'where', 'women', 'apparently', 'lose', 'consciousness', 'when', 'rose', 'awakens', 'sharon', 'disappeared', 'silent', 'hill', 'foot', 'officer', 'who', 'suspicious', 'reaching', 'destination', 'told', 'silent', 'hill', 'abandoned', 'town', 'due', 'underground', 'coal', 'fire', 'still', 'today', 'obvious', 'silent', 'hill', 'suffered', 'horrible', 'tragic', 'end', 'where', 'daughter', 'fit', 'husband', 'wife', 'gone', 'search', 'silent', 'hill', 'find', 'role', 'pretty', 'minor.I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'movie', 'am', 'familiar', 'just', 'plot', 'device', 'one', 'predictable', 'scenario', 'should', 'be', 'obvious', 'horror', 'fan', 'reminiscent', 'movie', 'jacob', 'ladder', 'spoilers', 'here', 'rose', 'encounters', 'various', 'bizarre', 'creatures', 'barely', 'coherent', 'woman', 'who', 'town', 'evil', 'time', 'movie', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'frightening', 'however', 'final', 'half', 'movie', 'explanation', 'convoluted', 'best', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', 'promise', 'big', 'things', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'silent', 'hill', 'exception', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'end', 'silent', 'hill', 'be', 'ambigious', 'are', 'many', 'clues', 'explain', 'final', 'scene', 'silent', 'hill', 'certainly', 'moments', 'very', 'gory', 'graphic', 'ultimately', 'somewhat', 'disappointment', 'still', 'better', 'many', 'horror', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'silent', 'hill', 'should', 'be', 'recommended']",N/A

1001713,AUS2EQT4NU3BF,B000GCFO08,"Jonathon Turner ""Jon Turner""","[2, 2]","It's definitely not CITIZEN KANE, but as far as videogame-to-movie adaptation goes, SILENT HILL is actually not too bad.  That is to say, it's not a particularly great film by any means, but compared to the likes of SUPER MARIO BROS, DOUBLE DRAGON, STREET FIGHTER and even the MORTAL KOMBAT movies, this is far more watchable.  About a woman who searches for her missing daughter in the titular city, SILENT HILL's strongest asset is its cinematography.  From the start, director Christophe Gans, who makes a solid effort to stay close to the creepy atmosphere of the game, recreates the titular villa with appropriately dark, gloomy colors.  The performances, too, are better than one might expect, with Radha Mitchell making a believable turn as the mother dedicated to finding her daughter.  Alice Kruge also gets to have another villainous role as a corrupt priestess who claims to ""purify"" the corrupt town.  But the film's strongest asset is the use of Akira Yamaoka's music from the games themselves.  That said, there are a couple of faults to be found; there are pacing issues and at least one subplot that really doesn't do much to advance the story (Sean Bean's character searching in the rain for his missing wife and child), and some scenes may be too gory for one's taste (particularly the finale).  Even so, this is still a very commendable effort for a videogame based movie, even if its appeal may be limited to gamers instead of general audiences.

So I viewed Silent Hill just as a normal film watcher. I'm comfortable to say that I enjoyed what I saw. I mean that literally. The visuals in this film are amazing from the beginning scene to the town of Silent Hill to its subtle ending. The dark and dreary aura that the film gave off is in major part due to the visuals. Although the first creature attack is obvious CGI, anything other than that is a great sight.That being said, the plotline became a little confusing to me. Little girl sleepwalks, adopted mother of little girl thinks it deals with the town little girl was born in, mother escapes husband with little girl to visit town, gets sucked into a world of horror, screwed up religion, monsters, and confusion. Got that part. We're told why the little girl was drawn there. Got that part. What I didn't get was the results of it all (and the end sequence that takes place in the church? Awesome and very reminiscent of Hellraiser 2). No spoilers given, but why did the lives of the mother and daughter continue the way that they were? I guess these questions really didn't matter as I was too busy enveloped into the visuals and crazyness going on.Radha Mitchell is beautiful. Her presence as the determined mother was evident, and the woman can play fear (also seen well in Pitch Black). JoDelle Ferland, who is the little girl, didn't really strike me as endearing.

I'm Kind Of A ...","[0, 0]","Silent Hill sure is a surprise and it certainly gets the job done by freaking you out in every way possible. The movie starts off really quick, it doesn't run around anything and it gets right to the point. Rose (Radha Mitchell) is frantically looking for her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) who hasn't been kidnapped but somehow sleepwalked all the way across a hectic highway to the edge of a canyon. You soon find out that this is a regular thing for Sharon and she is always saying things about Silent Hill while sleeping. After saving Sharon from attempting to throw herself off the edge Rose is fed up and takes a trip to Silent Hill against her husbands will and the real crazy stuff starts happening. After about 10 or 20 minutes into the movie when Rose has an accident entering Silent Hill and Sharon goes missing you start to doubt that anything more can be done with the story. It's actually a good feeling because you're unable to predict the next events and that's one of this films strengths.The acting is great and right on target, especially Radha Mitchell who goes above and beyond to save a child that seems so demented. I have never played the game Silent Hill but I was told there were changes made. The first change seems to be the biggest and that is Sharons mom takes the lead role and not her father. If you ask me the change was effective and positive because you can feel more emotion from the story and Radha Mitchell. The change even puts more to the story and actually allows Rose, Sharon, and Sharons past to have more in common. Another change is that in the game the town is covered in fog and snow but in this movie it's smoke and ash which actually make more sense because the back-story is the city is abandoned because of a coal mine fire that's still burning. That part actually freaked me out because it is said that the coal mine fire is modeled after one that actually exist in Pennsylvania, somewhere not too far from where I live.The most amazing thing about Silent hill is the sick creatures living deep within the town. I have never seen anything like these and they're perfectly nasty to give you that extra chill. Actually I should probably warn anyone with a weak stomach cause some of these guys remind you of the guy in the bed from the film Seven. Everything is perfectly paced and set so when it is time to creep you out your mind goes crazy. Silent Hill has a nice story that you wouldn't expect it to have since some scary flicks are lacking a good story these days. The question now is why did I give Silent Hill 4 stars if I talk about it like a 5 star movie? Well the problem is the ending. Silent Hill ends like a game would or a movie that is sure to have a sequel and since the viewer doesn't have the pleasure of playing this movie a different way to get an alternate ending like the game nobody will know what the heck was going on until a part 2. The movie is good and very entertaining, now all I'm waiting for is a sequel to clear a few things.",4,When Does It End?,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,3011,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'sure', 'surprise', 'certainly', 'job', 'done', 'freaking', 'out', 'way', 'possible', 'movie', 'really', 'quick', ""n't"", 'run', 'around', 'anything', 'right', 'point', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'frantically', 'looking', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'who', ""n't"", 'been', 'kidnapped', 'somehow', 'sleepwalked', 'way', 'hectic', 'highway', 'edge', 'canyon', 'soon', 'find', 'out', 'regular', 'thing', 'Sharon', 'always', 'saying', 'things', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'sleeping', 'saving', 'Sharon', 'attempting', 'throw', 'off', 'edge', 'Rose', 'fed', 'up', 'trip', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'husbands', 'will', 'real', 'crazy', 'stuff', 'happening', '10', '20', 'minutes', 'movie', 'when', 'Rose', 'accident', 'entering', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Sharon', 'missing', 'start', 'doubt', 'anything', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'story', 'actually', 'good', 'feeling', ""'re"", 'unable', 'predict', 'next', 'events', 'one', 'films', 'strengths.The', 'acting', 'great', 'right', 'target', 'especially', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'above', 'save', 'child', 'so', 'demented', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'told', 'were', 'changes', 'made', 'first', 'change', 'be', 'biggest', 'Sharons', 'mom', 'lead', 'role', 'not', 'father', 'ask', 'change', 'was', 'effective', 'positive', 'can', 'feel', 'more', 'emotion', 'story', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'change', 'even', 'more', 'story', 'actually', 'allows', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'Sharons', 'past', 'have', 'more', 'common', 'change', 'game', 'town', 'covered', 'fog', 'snow', 'movie', 'smoke', 'ash', 'actually', 'make', 'more', 'sense', 'back-story', 'city', 'abandoned', 'coal', 'mine', 'fire', 'still', 'burning', 'part', 'actually', 'freaked', 'out', 'said', 'coal', 'mine', 'fire', 'modeled', 'one', 'actually', 'exist', 'Pennsylvania', 'somewhere', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'where', 'live.The', 'most', 'amazing', 'thing', 'Silent', 'hill', 'sick', 'creatures', 'living', 'deep', 'town', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', ""'re"", 'perfectly', 'nasty', 'give', 'extra', 'chill', 'Actually', 'should', 'probably', 'warn', 'anyone', 'weak', 'stomach', 'cause', 'guys', 'remind', 'guy', 'bed', 'film', 'Seven', 'Everything', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'set', 'so', 'when', 'time', 'creep', 'out', 'mind', 'crazy', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'nice', 'story', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'have', 'scary', 'flicks', 'are', 'lacking', 'good', 'story', 'days', 'question', 'now', 'why', 'did', 'give', 'Silent', 'Hill', '4', 'stars', 'talk', '5', 'star', 'movie', 'Well', 'problem', 'ending', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'game', 'would', 'movie', 'sure', 'have', 'sequel', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'have', 'pleasure', 'playing', 'movie', 'different', 'way', 'get', 'alternate', 'ending', 'game', 'nobody', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'heck', 'was', 'going', 'part', '2', 'movie', 'good', 'very', 'entertaining', 'now', ""'m"", 'waiting', 'sequel', 'clear', 'few', 'things']",N/A
1001726,A380XMMAQGW34E,B000GCFO08,"Kevin Coughlan ""Killer7""","[4, 8]","At first when I heard that a Silent Hill movie is being released I had some worries for it. As you know, most of the video game adaptations so far have failed miserably. Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, House of the Dead, Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within and The Resident Evils-even though I would consider the first resident evil not to be the worst, it just doesnt give us what the Resident Evil video games are made of. Instead it piles in a bunch of zombies into a movie that seems so rushed and pretty pointless. But I still had to see what Silent Hill was like.As I was watching Silent Hill at the cinema I was thinking, can this be true? Did the movie makers actually develop the true meaning of a video game adaptation? The answer is Yes, absolutely. Ok, so it may not be your best horror film or scariest at that, but we werent exactly expecting it to be either. It does however deliver a big package in relation to the Silent Hill video games. Other than the other attempts of video game adaptations, here they really seemed to have taken the Silent Hill series into consideration. You will notice how the video game features are really brought into perspective. The atmosphere of the game is certainly held deeply within the movie, alongside the soundtrack taken directly from the game, brings you to the whole Silent Hill environment, with creatures and characters that seem incredibly accurate to the video game.But even though the CGI was done decent but not spectacular, I couldnt help think that maybe the CGI wasnt needed. As we know CGI can destroy a horror film, not help it. Yet it didnt destroy this film. I suppose they just could have laid a little low on it near the end. There are some scenes in the film I have noticed that was done extremely well without the CGI.(the creepy guy, in the bathroom, crawling along the floor with his feet by his head). Overall, Silent Hill isnt a masterpiece, nor will it have you shiver, but Silent Hill does, finally, deliver a 'great successfully accurate video game adaptation', with atmosphere and eerieness and a whole lot of fun for the Silent Hill fans.",3,A successfully Accurate Video Game adaptation.,1151712000,"07 1, 2006",2006,2119,"['first', 'when', 'heard', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'movie', 'being', 'released', 'had', 'worries', 'know', 'most', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'so', 'far', 'have', 'failed', 'miserably', 'Mario', 'Brothers', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'House', 'Dead', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'Resident', 'Evils-even', 'would', 'consider', 'first', 'resident', 'evil', 'not', 'be', 'worst', 'just', 'doesnt', 'give', 'what', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'video', 'games', 'are', 'made', 'Instead', 'bunch', 'zombies', 'movie', 'so', 'rushed', 'pretty', 'pointless', 'still', 'had', 'see', 'what', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'was', 'like.As', 'was', 'watching', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'cinema', 'was', 'thinking', 'can', 'be', 'true', 'Did', 'movie', 'makers', 'actually', 'develop', 'true', 'meaning', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', 'answer', 'Yes', 'absolutely', 'Ok', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'horror', 'film', 'scariest', 'werent', 'exactly', 'expecting', 'be', 'either', 'however', 'deliver', 'big', 'package', 'relation', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'games', 'Other', 'other', 'attempts', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'here', 'really', 'seemed', 'have', 'taken', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'series', 'consideration', 'will', 'notice', 'how', 'video', 'game', 'features', 'are', 'really', 'brought', 'perspective', 'atmosphere', 'game', 'certainly', 'held', 'deeply', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'taken', 'directly', 'game', 'whole', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'environment', 'creatures', 'characters', 'seem', 'incredibly', 'accurate', 'video', 'game.But', 'even', 'CGI', 'was', 'done', 'decent', 'not', 'spectacular', 'couldnt', 'help', 'think', 'maybe', 'CGI', 'wasnt', 'needed', 'know', 'CGI', 'can', 'destroy', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'help', 'destroy', 'film', 'suppose', 'just', 'could', 'have', 'laid', 'little', 'low', 'end', 'are', 'scenes', 'film', 'have', 'noticed', 'was', 'done', 'extremely', 'well', 'CGI', 'creepy', 'guy', 'bathroom', 'crawling', 'floor', 'feet', 'head', 'Overall', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'masterpiece', 'will', 'have', 'shiver', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'finally', 'deliver', ""'great"", 'successfully', 'accurate', 'video', 'game', 'adaptation', 'atmosphere', 'eerieness', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'fans']",N/A

1001730,A2DXOD9HQBE1FL,B000GCFO08,"Kevin Rienecker ""Kev""","[6, 11]","Okay guys, first of all, I know you can't help but compare this flick (I hate to call it a film) to the video game, but that's a flawed view. This here is a movie, kids, and for a movie review, I have to judge this stinker on it's cinematic merits - not on how close the cast & crew were able to come to duplicating the gaming experience.So, two stars, 'cause this baby stank like rotten, year-old Cheez-Whiz, but I'll give it ten stars for the cheesiness factor. The best part of watching Silent Hill is tearing the crappy thing up while trying to figure out all the other movies it cheerfully rips off during the process. While the production design is initially kinda groovy, watch enough movies and you'll see the filmmakers stealing pieces from everything that's come down the pike the over last thirty years or so, including using the evil cult motiff from Robin Hardy and Anthony Shaffer'a eerily atmospheric thriller, The Wicker Man; the creepy, faceless, fast-frame jerky angel/demons from Adrian Lyne's mysterious Jacob's Ladder and bits from Clive Barker's macabre and operatic bloody vision, Hellraiser; all the way to the new fright-movie cliche, the spectral, evil, often lank-haired child (typically a little girl) introduced with the new wave of Asian horror cinema, a-la Hideo Nakata's Ringu (The Ring), Hideo Nakata's Dark Water, and Takashi Shimizu's Ju-On (The Grudge).The, uh, plot has already been outlined here extensively: Husband and wife Christoper and Rose Da Silva (Sean Bean and Radha Mitchell) adopt a beautiful, waif-ish girl named Sharon who's a cronic sleepwalker. At the beginning of the film we find Rose, panicked, racing to rescue sleepwalking Sharon from the edge of their backyard cliff. Okay. Sharon mumbles the name of a town, Silent Hill, over and over, and Rose decides to ditch hubby Christopher and take Sharon to this Silent Hill ghost town, because, heck, that'll help cure her of these whacky episodes, right? On the way, the pair becomes the subject of interest for a hot, tight-leather wearing female cop with an instinct for helping kids in trouble. Rose bolts after the cop decides to pull her over, and suddenly, there's a high-speed chase through the hills and into the off-limits town (turns out there's a coal fire still burning under the town after 30 plus years, and the town's deserted). There's a crash, and when Rose comes to, Sharon's gone. Not easily dissuaded by the creepy town, Rose heads out in search of her daughter, with the sexy cop and eventually, hubby Christopher in hot pursuit.Along the way Rose encounters a rogues gallery of ghoulishly evil characters; a crazy woman spouting fire and brimstone warnings; a flitting, waifish entity named Alessa that's the spitting image of her daughter Sharon; and finally, a crazy cult holed up in a church the size of Notre Dame, led by a woman who looks an awful lot like Sigourny Weaver impersonating a maniacal school-marm.To steal a segment from another Amazon reviewer, I did learn a few things watching Silent Hill, that I thought I'd pass on:1. A house right on the edge of a cliff is the perfect living environment for an adopted child with a sleep walking condition.2. When thinking of adoption, stay the hell away from waif-ish, doe-eyed little girls with long, stringy brown hair and insanely creepy split personalities. They always seem have some unknown problems you just don't want to deal with (see #1, above, for example...)3. Note to all hot, sexy, tight black leather wearing cop-babes: shouting 'Stop!' before shooting a shambling, burning acid-spitting, humanoid thingy that looks like it's got another nine or ten people rolling around in its torso, fighting to get out, will only provoke getting said acid-spit directed your way.4. Note to all aspiring horror film-makers: directing a shambling monster thingy's burning acid-spit toward a hot, sexy cop is the perfect way to get said cop to remove her burdensome leather clothing.5. Muscle bound demon-guys with pyramids instead of heads are really scary and carry really, really big knives.6. And I quote: Dahlia Gillespie: ""Why didn't she take me? Like the others?"" Rose: ""Because you're her mother. Mother is God in the eyes of a child."" Whooo - That's deep.7. You can only enter Silent Hill if you're dead. Um, I think. And if so, even dead people can still be burnt to death by crazed cult members. I think.8. Crazed cult members bent on killing you will calm down easily if you just casually push them away.9. Stiv carrying zombie-demon nurses are really hot; especially when they're lined up wearing skimpy demon-nurse uniforms, stumbling around like the chorus for a creepy version of Silent Hill, the musical.10. When you finally find and confront the little devil-girl Alessa and discover 'The Truth', it turns out to be holiday footage of the Crazy Cult's special Little Witch Burning Day, preserved on badly deteriorating, overdeveloped film stock shot sometime circa 1973.That about covers it, I think, beyond getting into the extras included in the DVD, which is the increasingly standard making of documentary broken into a whopping six parts covering everything from the origins of the game to the creature development. Frankly, I found the extras more fun - definitely more interesting - than the finished movie.I love bad horror movies as much as the next guy, but except for coming away slightly nauseated, I've got to say that there's really not anything particularly scary in Silent Hill - other than the gawd-awful dialogue and crummy acting - it's just grisly. I really hate to think about anyone wanting to watch this stinker more than once. While video games have become more and more cinematic in their storytelling, Silent Hill is a perfect example of the ineptitude of incorporating corny, choppy plotlines - which work fine in a game format - into the film medium; and also, how low Hollywood has sunk in its continuing attempt to flush more and more cash from an increasingly growing market (all of us gamers out here, me included), who are too often willing to shell out our hard earned money - often up to $50 bucks a pop for most video games - for tripe like this.",2,Abandon hope all who enter here...,1156809600,"08 29,

Unfortunately, all of those creepy moments in the trailers are the only creepy moments in this film.  ""Silent Hill,"" based on a videogame series I've never played before, tells us the story of Rose, a mother who is trying to come to terms with the sleepwalking and nightmarish fits of her daughter, Sharon.  Sharon constantly speaks of Silent Hill in her fits, so Rose tracks the actual place down and takes her there against the will of her husband, Chris.Pursued by a policewoman while trying to get to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon are involved in a car accident.  When Rose awakes, Sharon has vanished and the cop is attempting to arrest her.  When Rose and the policewoman encounter a ""thing"" outside of Silent Hill, Rose uses the distraction to escape from the officer and seek out her daughter in the creepy, fallout-looking town of Silent Hill.  We are slowly lead around the town for what seems like an eternity.  We are intentionally denied specifics in an attempt to build both suspense and confusion.  Rose begins chasing another young girl in the town who she believes can lead her to her daughter.  Along the way, Rose and the cop befriend each other and they join together in a battle against supernatural forces and mutant-like creatures in order to save Sharon.Meanwhile, Rose's husband is desperately trying to find his wife and daughter.  He, along with a suspicious cop, scourge the same Silent Hill looking for his family, but instead of the gray, misty version of the town that Rose is trapped in, Chris is simply in a deserted town.  This is the first tip-off that Silent Hill might be operating on two separate planes of reality.Confusing, dull, lacking in any real interesting characters, ""Silent Hill"" is obviously meant for the game kids to sit back and enjoy the inside jokes.  I'm disappointed in Sean Bean for agreeing to be in this drivel, he's much better in ""Equilibrium,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" and the ""Sharpe's"" films.  Radha Mitchell also brings little to the table in this bummer.  Director Christophe Gans remembered to bring the atmosphere from his wonderful ""Brotherhood of the Wolf,"" but he forgot character development, good action sequences, a credible plot, and some decent scares.  Instead, he got graphic-happy with more CGI blood and guts than you can shake a stick at.If you love the games, I'm guessing you'll enjoy this flick.  However, if you want a legitimate scary flick, look elsewhere.  Also, a better video-game based movie is either of the ""Resident Evil"" films.  They have better plots, faster action, and much better baddies.  Oh, and before I'm accused of being a lover of ""Resident Evil"" the game, I've never played that either and I still managed to keep up with the storyline.Rent at your own risk.",2,Yawnnnn.............,1158278400,"09 15, 2006",2006,2823,"['trailers', 'film', 'made', 'look', 'really', 'really', 'creepy', 'Unfortunately', 'creepy', 'moments', 'trailers', 'are', 'only', 'creepy', 'moments', 'film', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'based', 'videogame', 'series', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'story', 'Rose', 'mother', 'who', 'trying', 'come', 'terms', 'sleepwalking', 'nightmarish', 'fits', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Sharon', 'constantly', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'fits', 'so', 'Rose', 'tracks', 'actual', 'place', 'down', 'will', 'husband', 'Chris.Pursued', 'policewoman', 'trying', 'get', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'are', 'involved', 'car', 'accident', 'When', 'Rose', 'awakes', 'Sharon', 'vanished', 'cop', 'attempting', 'arrest', 'When', 'Rose', 'policewoman', 'thing', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Rose', 'distraction', 'escape', 'officer', 'seek', 'out', 'daughter', 'creepy', 'fallout-looking', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'are', 'slowly', 'lead', 'town', 'what', 'eternity', 'are', 'intentionally', 'denied', 'specifics', 'attempt', 'build', 'suspense', 'confusion', 'Rose', 'chasing', 'young', 'girl', 'town', 'who', 'can', 'lead', 'daughter', 'way', 'Rose', 'cop', 'befriend', 'other', 'join', 'together', 'battle', 'supernatural', 'forces', 'mutant-like', 'creatures', 'order', 'save', 'Sharon.Meanwhile', 'Rose', 'husband', 'desperately', 'trying', 'find', 'wife', 'daughter', 'suspicious', 'cop', 'scourge', 'same', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'looking', 'family', 'instead', 'gray', 'misty', 'version', 'town', 'Rose', 'trapped', 'Chris', 'simply', 'deserted', 'town', 'first', 'tip-off', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'might', 'be', 'operating', 'two', 'separate', 'planes', 'reality.Confusing', 'dull', 'lacking', 'real', 'interesting', 'characters', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'obviously', 'meant', 'game', 'kids', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'inside', 'jokes', ""'m"", 'disappointed', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'agreeing', 'be', 'drivel', 'much', 'better', 'Equilibrium', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Sharpe', 'films', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'also', 'little', 'table', 'bummer', 'Director', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'remembered', 'bring', 'atmosphere', 'wonderful', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'forgot', 'character', 'development', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'credible', 'plot', 'decent', 'scares', 'Instead', 'got', 'graphic-happy', 'more', 'CGI', 'blood', 'guts', 'can', 'shake', 'stick', 'at.If', 'love', 'games', ""'m"", 'guessing', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'flick', 'However', 'want', 'legitimate', 'scary', 'flick', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Also', 'better', 'video-game', 'based', 'movie', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'films', 'have', 'better', 'plots', 'faster', 'action', 'much', 'better', 'baddies', 'Oh', ""'m"", 'accused', 'being', 'lover', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'game', ""'ve"", 'never', 'played', 'still', 'managed', 'keep', 'up', 'storyline.Rent', 'own', 'risk']",N/A

After we sat through this monstronsity, my brother looked at me and said, ""Well, the popcorn was good."" There are so many things wrong with this film, it's hard to choose even where to begin.First of all, nobody acts like these characters in real life...hell, nobody acts like these characters in a video game! The acting was terrible -- everybody overacts. Sean Bean would've gone into an utter rage if the restaurant would've said they were out of complimentary toothpicks or mints.The special effects were incredibly good, but there simply was no script. I got the feeling they created all of these creepy effects shots and then just told the actors to improvise. In the beginning, there was an actual place that was a gas station, restaurant and tattoo parlor rolled into one. I said to my brother, ""It has everything you'll ever need!"" At times, the scenes were so absurd, that I started busting up laughing -- so hard I was in tears.The first hour, in spite of the absurdity of the story, does have several creepy scenes that weren't all that bad, but during the second hour, the film completely changed with a whole new plot even more insane than the first! I got the impression they could've finished the film after the first hour, but since it needed to be longer, they just threw some even more crappy plotline together.

It looks EXACTLY like the game come to life with every minor detail.  I can honestly say that this is the Best adaptation of a video game into a movie that I have ever seen.  In the beginning, you will groan with censure at the opening sequence of the child actor screaming ""Silent Hill!  Silent Hill!"" and you think, ""Oh man, this movie is going to suck.""  But stay in your seats because surprisingly, the actor they chose for the role of Sharon (not Cheryl) does a spectacular job. The story was changed around slightly so that it would be easier to understand for non-gamers, but there were still some story holes.  The husband character's purpose was to fill in plot points and show the audience that Silent Hill is no ordinary town, though he doesn't seem to serve much purpose.  If you're watching it and you have no idea what's going on, sit tight because there will be a long narration at the end for those who don't get it.  I still stick by my standards that a good filmmaker doesn't need a narrator to explain the story if they've done their job right, but I can't really complain about this one.  They threw in as much from the games that would fit, including Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2.  If you've played the game, you'll love this movie.  If you haven't, it still makes a good horror flick, but you probably won't love it.  If you're unsatisfied with the ending, you should know that this wasn't so much a typical horror movie as the start of a franchise.

When Sharon vanishes, Rose is forced to search Silent Hill for her daughter. Rose's search finally leads her to Sharon's kidnappers, a bizarre religious cult that is dedicated to burning demons alive---of course, Rose and Sharon qualify as demons. And although the cult are the bad guys of the film, there seems to be no connection between them and the various monsters Rose has to fight to find Sharon, meaning that three quarters of SILENT HILL has nothing to do with itself.The major problem with SILENT HILL is that it simply isn't frightening, its just gross. Rating a 25 on the 1-10 gross-out meter, SILENT HILL even loses its effectiveness as a nausea-inducing, ""Ewwww!""-producing movie because the grossness becomes predictable. Nothing shocks because the last scene was so yucky it becomes a safe assumption that the next scene is going to be even yuckier, and it always is.A film largely geared to fans of the video game who will give it five by five, SILENT HILL gets one star for its atmospherics, which are appropriately dark, and another star for actress Radha Mitchell (Rose) who carries most of this film on her slender shoulders alone, seems convincing in the midst of this pointless chaos, and looks good doing it.",2,This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Two Of Us,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1873,"['SILENT', 'HILL', 'based', 'series', 'survival', 'video', 'games', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'game', 'will', 'probably', 'appreciate', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'movie', 'rest', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'wearying', 'unvarying', 'plotless', 'stumble', 'world', 'atmospheric', 'horror.Rose', 'Da', 'Silva', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'find', 'out', 'Why', 'Sharon', 'recurrent', 'town', 'first', 'deserted', 'densely', 'populated', 'wraiths', 'giant', 'arachnids', 'faceless', 'zombies', 'eyeless', 'walking', 'corpses', 'other', 'grotesques', 'trapped', 'congruent', 'dimension', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'are', 'drawn', 'When', 'Sharon', 'vanishes', 'Rose', 'forced', 'search', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'search', 'finally', 'Sharon', 'kidnappers', 'bizarre', 'religious', 'cult', 'dedicated', 'burning', 'demons', 'alive', '-of', 'course', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'qualify', 'demons', 'cult', 'are', 'bad', 'guys', 'film', 'be', 'connection', 'various', 'monsters', 'Rose', 'fight', 'find', 'Sharon', 'meaning', 'three', 'quarters', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'nothing', 'do', 'itself.The', 'major', 'problem', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'simply', ""n't"", 'frightening', 'just', 'gross', 'Rating', '25', '1-10', 'gross-out', 'meter', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'even', 'effectiveness', 'nausea-inducing', 'Ewwww', '-producing', 'movie', 'grossness', 'predictable', 'Nothing', 'shocks', 'last', 'scene', 'was', 'so', 'yucky', 'safe', 'assumption', 'next', 'scene', 'going', 'be', 'even', 'yuckier', 'always', 'is.A', 'film', 'largely', 'geared', 'fans', 'video', 'game', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'five', 'five', 'SILENT', 'HILL', 'one', 'star', 'atmospherics', 'are', 'appropriately', 'dark', 'star', 'actress', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Rose', 'who', 'most', 'film', 'slender', 'shoulders', 'alone', 'convincing', 'midst', 'pointless', 'chaos', 'good', 'doing']",N/A

If you have never heard of Silent Hill before you've seen this, you are lucky. I'm not saying that the movie was really bad or anything, it's just...come on! I'm one of the hugest silent Hill fans to ever grace this earth! I was expecting it to be like the movie. I understand that most movies are never exactly like the game or book, but I wasn't expecting this. In the videogameSilent Hill, there is a man, Harry Manson, searching for his daughter Cheryl in the town of Silent Hill after he swerved on the road trying to avoid a girl in the road, after he woke up in the car to find her missing. There's the first problem. In this movie, there is a married couple. The lady, Rose, takes her daughter to silent hill because this girl has been having nightmares and doing weird things all drawn in by this abandoned town. The plot, and alot of things in the movie don't even exist in the game.This movie was produced by an english company. They called the infamous Pyramid Head, ""red pyramid"" which disapointed me greatly.All in all the movie was okay. It wasn't what I expected, but It still keeps the eerie silent hill feeling.

1001737,A3LX9270E6DMCQ,B000GCFO08,K. Sylverne,"[4, 4]","Let me first off start by saying that I'm obsessed with the Silent Hill game series.  And I'm going to try to write this review as unbiased as I can get for the benefit of those that haven't played the game series.Silent Hill is a game about atmosphere and art direction.  The plot is there, but no where near as strong as the production.  Which makes it a good film, instead of a great film.For the game fans, I feel that Christophe Gans has captured Silent Hill to a T.  His vision, is my vision of the town and monsters.  And I hope he's onboard for the visual direction of the sequel if there is one.Acting, was done as best as it could be.  I feel that all the main characters, Rose, Sharon, Cybil, Cristabella, and Dahlia, were done wonderfully.  The script wasn't the best, and they did what they could with it.  Rhada played Rose splendidly in my opinion, her fear leaking out of the screen.  Laurie did a great job with cybil, helping the audience feel compassion for her.  Jodelle was a little weak with Sharon, however did a splendid job with Alessa.  For a little girl, I was throughly impressed.The creature effects really stand out.  Instead of being purely CG, they took the time and effort to get dancers to do the monsters, and put them in costume.  If you watch the behind the scenes, its really impressive.  And I think a lot of horror movies could learn from this decision.  CGI is not the right choice all the time.  Green screens were used as well, however I feel that Silent Hill is one of the few  movies that pulls off CGI effects and costume effects really well.  Perhaps because its meant to be such a surreal movie, one in which you're supposed to suspend reality, that its not as noticeable.The plot, as I said, is lacking, but for what its worth I think it generally worked okay.  As an adaption they did what they could.  Anyone who knows the storyline of the first game, knows how complex it is.  And personally, if so  many people were confused with this current plot line, then I suppose they made the best choice in simplifying it.  I feel that its fairly easy to follow, and I think they did a good job of trying to show the different realities and such of the world of Silent Hill.  It sets up what the town's about, which is what Gans was aiming for, since he originally wanted to adapt the second game.  I think he made a good choice of trying to explain the town first, and why it is the way it is.As for the special features, there aren't any, really.  Which is dissapointing.  The behind the scenes special is fun, and a great feature, however its the only feature.  During the behind the scenes we can see that there are many scenes that weren't used, and it would've been nice to see these deleted scenes.  It would've also been nice to have some trailers to the movie, some trailers for the video games, and maybe a few fun extras to do with the games.But that's what the infamous ""double dipping"" is for, right?In short, if you're a fan of horror, and if you can let the atmosphere and movie wash over you, it should be an enjoyable romp.  Don't sit there, and try to figure things out as the movie's going on.  You really just have to let the movie lead you through, and wrap you up in its world.  Its a gorgeous film, and can be entertaining if you let it.",4,Beginning to break the Video Game Movie curse,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,3304,"['Let', 'first', 'off', 'start', 'saying', ""'m"", 'obsessed', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'game', 'series', ""'m"", 'going', 'try', 'write', 'review', 'as', 'unbiased', 'can', 'get', 'benefit', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'game', 'series.Silent', 'Hill', 'game', 'atmosphere', 'art', 'direction', 'plot', 'there', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'strong', 'production', 'good', 'film', 'instead', 'great', 'film.For', 'game', 'fans', 'feel', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'captured', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'T.', 'vision', 'vision', 'town', 'monsters', 'hope', 'onboard', 'visual', 'direction', 'sequel', 'one.Acting', 'was', 'done', 'as', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'feel', 'main', 'characters', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'Cybil', 'Cristabella', 'Dahlia', 'were', 'done', 'wonderfully', 'script', 'was', ""n't"", 'best', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'Rhada', 'played', 'Rose', 'splendidly', 'opinion', 'fear', 'leaking', 'screen', 'Laurie', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'cybil', 'helping', 'audience', 'feel', 'compassion', 'Jodelle', 'was', 'little', 'weak', 'Sharon', 'however', 'did', 'splendid', 'job', 'Alessa', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'throughly', 'impressed.The', 'creature', 'effects', 'really', 'stand', 'out', 'Instead', 'being', 'purely', 'CG', 'took', 'time', 'effort', 'get', 'dancers', 'do', 'monsters', 'put', 'costume', 'watch', 'scenes', 'really', 'impressive', 'think', 'lot', 'horror', 'movies', 'could', 'learn', 'decision', 'CGI', 'not', 'right', 'choice', 'time', 'Green', 'screens', 'were', 'used', 'as', 'well', 'however', 'feel', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'CGI', 'effects', 'costume', 'effects', 'really', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'meant', 'be', 'such', 'surreal', 'movie', 'one', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'suspend', 'reality', 'not', 'noticeable.The', 'plot', 'said', 'lacking', 'what', 'worth', 'think', 'generally', 'worked', 'okay', 'adaption', 'did', 'what', 'could', 'Anyone', 'who', 'storyline', 'first', 'game', 'how', 'complex', 'personally', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'were', 'confused', 'current', 'plot', 'line', 'then', 'suppose', 'made', 'best', 'choice', 'simplifying', 'feel', 'fairly', 'easy', 'follow', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'trying', 'show', 'different', 'realities', 'such', 'world', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'up', 'what', 'town', 'what', 'Gans', 'was', 'aiming', 'originally', 'wanted', 'adapt', 'second', 'game', 'think', 'made', 'good', 'choice', 'trying', 'explain', 'town', 'first', 'why', 'way', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'Which', 'dissapointing', 'scenes', 'special', 'fun', 'great', 'feature', 'however', 'only', 'feature', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'were', ""n't"", 'used', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'also', 'been', 'nice', 'have', 'trailers', 'movie', 'trailers', 'video', 'games', 'maybe', 'few', 'fun', 'extras', 'do', 'games.But', 'what', 'infamous', 'double', 'dipping', 'right', 'short', ""'re"", 'fan', 'horror', 'can', 'let', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'wash', 'should', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'romp', 'Do', ""n't"", 'sit', 'there', 'try', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'movie', 'going', 'really', 'just', 'have', 'let', 'movie', 'lead', 'wrap', 'up', 'world', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'entertaining', 'let']",N/A
1001738,A30IP5D5DLHRPA,B000GCFO08,Kyle Slayzar,"[5, 6]","After emerging from the theatre, my friends and I were soo creeped out that we had to come up with something positive and friendly and the only thing we could come up with was fly a kite (hence the title).So, like many gamers, I was afraid like the video game/movie predecessors Silent Hill would follow the legacy of sucking.  I am proud to report that my expectations were mostly wrong.  Silent Hill was much better than I expected and with that are the pros and cons.Pros.Actually followed the details of the game to a degree that it's good for gamers, but not annoying for the general audience.  The scenes of Silent Hill were well done and didn't look fake at all down to the last details.  However, the producers did deviate some with the endings (which led to much discussion amongst my friends and I) and what they represented.Silent Hill is not your typical horror film at all.  For once, it made my friends (also avid gamers and film buffs) actually think about the movie in philisophical terms... something we've never done with a horror film.  Also, the movie does not incorporate the usual suspense and surprise themes.  Instead, Silent Hill has a constant state of fear with stuff that fades in and out such as pyramid head (the wacky villian with a head that looks like a piece of road construction for you non-gamers).As for the horror aspect, the movie was just creepy from literally start to finish.  The climax at the end just made my skin crawl as it did with my friends in the audience.  Throughout the film it is just one creepy concept after another with bugs, pyramid head and the other monsters seen in the game.  I was not on the edge of my seat the whole time, but my skin did crawl once or twice.The story was nice, falling almost completely in line with the original Silent Hill game for the playstation and even explains how Silent Hill became the way it was in a comprehensive manner.  Again, my friends and I had to sit down after the movie and discuss the ending because it was soo... thought provoking, which is unheard of in horror films that like to wing the ending in hopes of making a sequel.The music was done by the original composer of the Silent Hill games, which confused the audience with it's Japanese-style suspense (which is very similar to the music in the anime Patlabor) but made the gamer fans just nod and smile.  Some parts had the typical game beats, which probably was not a good idea so it wasn't perfect, but good nonetheless.Now for the cons.  The acting was a bit off by some, particularly the 'scavengers' in Silent Hill.  I think the woman in the church was the same one who played the queen Borg in Star Trek: First Contact... which made it a little weird.  Sean Bean does his usual excellent performance and plays a role people can actually like for a change.Again, the climax scene seemed a bit... odd and downright cheesy at points.  It was also a bit gross and excessive in some perspectives and could've been done a lot better.  This also makes me agree with my peers that there needed to be more pyramid head... he just wasn't in there enough and he played a major role in the games and was bad*ss enough as is as a villain.Many parts seemed a bit cheesy such as the 'survivors.'  Some of the lines just seemed soo... captain obvious.  At one point, the cop turns to rose and says, ""I think something bad happened here,"" or took a look around a burned building and said, ""I think there was a fire here.""

1001745,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000GCFO08,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[7, 8]","I have seen several of these movies that are based on video games, but ""Silent Hill"" is the first one where I have been motivated to order one of the games and try it out. This was not just because of the bizarre world that I saw on screen, but also because of the testimonial provided by director Christophe Gans in the special features on this DVD, who started playing the original ""Silent Hill"" game and apparently got three or four hours into it when it hit him it would work as a movie. But there is something to be said for the bizarre world and if style overwhelms substance in this 2006 horror film that is more because the style is so omnipresent than the problematic elements of the substance.So I know nothing about the ""Silent Hill"" videogame and have no idea where the movie is being faithful and where it is grossly offending game players. Rose DaSilva (Radha Mitchell) has an adopted daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), who sleepwalks across the interstate in the middle of the night to stand on the precipice screaming ""Silent Hill!"" It turns out that this is the name of a ghost town in West Virginia that was abandoned because of uncontrollable fires in the coal minds underneath the town. Rose decides to take Sharon there because that is the sort of thing you do in videogames (or movies) when somebody in a heightened state of awareness starts screaming clues. Besides, Sharon keeps drawing pictures of the place. Rose's husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), does not think this is a good idea so she starts off without telling him and he spends the rest of the film playing catchup.According to everybody Rose asks, you cannot get to Silent Hill from here, except that there is a road sign that still indicates the turn off. However, when Rose takes the fateful road up to Silent Hill she does so by driving away from the female highway patrol cop on a motorcycle who pulled her over. The next thing we know there is a car accident and when Rose comes to again, Sharon is gone. We now have the basic situation of the movie: Sharon is lost in Silent Hill, and Rose is going to have to go find her.Beyond that I really do not want to say more about the plot of the film because what matters is not the specifics of how Rose tracks down Sharon, but that she does it in a world aptly described at one point on the DVD as ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Dante's Inferno."" The latter reference point is obvious because I was thinking early on that Gustave Dore's etchings for ""The Inferno"" were an artistic inspiration for what is going on here (along with Nine Inch Nails music videos) with Carol Spier's production design and Dan Laustsen's cinematography, but I can see where Rose and Sharon have gone down a hell of a rabbit hole as well. Rarely have I seen a film where what is happening is taking a back seat to the locale, but ""Silent Hill"" really is that sort of a film. I want to see what happens next for the visual dimensions rather than for what it means for the narrative.However, I will speak to the apparent confusion that exists over what is going on, without explaining what is happening (and with one hand tied behind my back). At issue is whether Silent Hill is a town gone wrong because of an unnatural disaster, like in ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (think of bituminous coal as the early 19th century equivalent of rampant nuclear energy), or whether it is an alternative reality, like in ""Army of Darkness."" This is a key question, and the answer is that the film is both. That is not obvious, at least not until you catch the key visual difference between the two, but it is important to understanding what is happening in the film. Even at the end I am not totally sure what has just happened, but I saw the final twist coming and I liked it, and I have not liked the final twist in a horror film since ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara.""

1001752,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B000GCFO08,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[2, 2]","The beginning of this movie confused me, which I suppose was the intent of the director and the producer.  Throughout the movie you get bits and pieces of what is happening until near the end of the movie, when most, but not all, of the details are explained.Plot Spoilers Avoided to the Extent Possible!Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) is taking her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill to understand why her daughter is having nightmares and sleep walking.  Husband Christopher opposes Rose's trip and does everything in his power to stop the trip.  Of course, Rose and Sharon arrive in Silent Hill with a motorcycle officer close behind.Once in Silent Hill, all confusion and horror breaks out.  Sharon immediately disappears.  The imagery is bizarre and surreal, alternating with sinister figures and creatures that can only be some kind of ghosts.  What is going on?  Why is the sky around Silent Hill always overcast with ash falling?A few minor details about the story of ""Silent Hill.""  We learn that a little girl was molested, and a self-righteous woman decided the little girl had to be ""purified.""  The girl's injuries were horrific, but she also acquired an incredible, largely evil power driven by her need for revenge.  Eventually the little girl caused a fire deep within the earth to erupt into the town of Silent Hill, killing many of the citizens.  We learn that citizens of the town have imposed their own peculiar and strict brand of faith on the town for centuries.  The town has mostly been abandoned, but the abandonment does not necessarily extend to every dimension...This movie shares some similarities to Japanese horror films.  The movie is loosely based on the Silent Hill series of video games, and a couple of artifacts of the video games were imported that appear to make little sense in the movie.  Fortunately, the distractions from the video game that fail to advance the plot are minimal, though they do enhance the confusion felt by Rose.This movie falls well shy of being a great horror movie, but it is fun to watch and the cinematography is outstanding.  The director used overhead shots a lot to reinforce our aloofness from certain scenes, but in other scenes we were extremely close to the action.  The director also alternated dramatic scenes with detailed scenes.  The director's intent seemed to be to contrast our desire to know, but our desire to keep from being affected by our observations.  The director refuses to let us escape from being part of the action, and by the end of the movie we are all too up close and personal with the events of the film.Horror movie fans will want to watch this movie for its brilliant cinematography and imaginative special effects.  However, be prepared to think and watch the movie more than once to figure out what is going on.  Splatter film fans will likely be bored by the carefully constructed story line that requires the entire movie to evolve.  Action movie fans will be bored because this movie has only intermittent action.Enjoy!",4,Spooky and Surreal,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,3039,"['beginning', 'movie', 'confused', 'suppose', 'was', 'intent', 'director', 'producer', 'movie', 'get', 'bits', 'pieces', 'what', 'happening', 'end', 'movie', 'when', 'most', 'not', 'details', 'are', 'explained.Plot', 'Spoilers', 'Avoided', 'Extent', 'Possible', 'Rose', 'Da', 'Silva', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'taking', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'understand', 'why', 'daughter', 'having', 'nightmares', 'sleep', 'walking', 'Husband', 'Christopher', 'Rose', 'trip', 'everything', 'power', 'stop', 'trip', 'course', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'arrive', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'motorcycle', 'officer', 'close', 'behind.Once', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'confusion', 'horror', 'breaks', 'out', 'Sharon', 'immediately', 'imagery', 'bizarre', 'surreal', 'alternating', 'sinister', 'figures', 'creatures', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'kind', 'ghosts', 'What', 'going', 'Why', 'sky', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'always', 'overcast', 'ash', 'falling', 'few', 'minor', 'details', 'story', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'learn', 'little', 'girl', 'was', 'molested', 'self-righteous', 'woman', 'decided', 'little', 'girl', 'had', 'be', 'purified', 'girl', 'injuries', 'were', 'horrific', 'also', 'acquired', 'incredible', 'largely', 'evil', 'power', 'driven', 'need', 'revenge', 'Eventually', 'little', 'girl', 'caused', 'fire', 'deep', 'earth', 'erupt', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'killing', 'many', 'citizens', 'learn', 'citizens', 'town', 'have', 'imposed', 'own', 'peculiar', 'strict', 'brand', 'faith', 'town', 'centuries', 'town', 'mostly', 'been', 'abandoned', 'abandonment', 'not', 'necessarily', 'extend', 'dimension', 'movie', 'shares', 'similarities', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', 'movie', 'loosely', 'based', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'series', 'video', 'games', 'couple', 'artifacts', 'video', 'games', 'were', 'imported', 'appear', 'make', 'little', 'sense', 'movie', 'Fortunately', 'distractions', 'video', 'game', 'fail', 'advance', 'plot', 'are', 'minimal', 'do', 'enhance', 'confusion', 'felt', 'Rose.This', 'movie', 'well', 'shy', 'being', 'great', 'horror', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'director', 'used', 'overhead', 'shots', 'lot', 'reinforce', 'aloofness', 'certain', 'scenes', 'other', 'scenes', 'were', 'extremely', 'close', 'action', 'director', 'also', 'alternated', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'detailed', 'scenes', 'director', 'intent', 'seemed', 'be', 'contrast', 'desire', 'know', 'desire', 'keep', 'being', 'affected', 'observations', 'director', 'let', 'escape', 'being', 'part', 'action', 'end', 'movie', 'are', 'too', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'events', 'film.Horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'brilliant', 'cinematography', 'imaginative', 'special', 'effects', 'However', 'be', 'prepared', 'think', 'watch', 'movie', 'more', 'once', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'Splatter', 'film', 'fans', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'bored', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'story', 'line', 'entire', 'movie', 'evolve', 'Action', 'movie', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'bored', 'movie', 'only', 'intermittent', 'action.Enjoy']",N/A

1001757,A1H1O1UV61R0EX,B000GCFO08,LuvDuchess,"[1, 1]","When this movie was released back in April 2006, I was more than thrilled to go see it. Although I'm a huge fan of the series at that time I didn't care if the movie would be bad or not, and when I say bad I mean on par with the Street Fighter movie bad. But thank goodness it turned out to be great. I even dragged my cousin, who is somewhat familiar with the game from watching me play during sleepovers, to the theater to see this with me.  She was grossed out, horrified, and stunned by the film, as was I.  It was pretty scary for me even for a movie adaption of the game.Video-game fans are somewhat a hard crowd to please for the most part. The word 'adaption' means just that, it's not going to be the Silent Hill game rehashed bit by bit.  Why pay money for a movie when you already know what's going to happen?  I'm a fan of the series, but some just take their 'fandom' waaay too seriously.  It's a video-game movie, just be happy that sad sack director Uwe Boll(House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, BloodRayne, Doom) didn't get his disgsting mitts on this project, then you'd really have something to bitch about.Instead of the male protagonist we had in SH1, we're introduced to Rose(Radha Mitchell) who takes her adoptive daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, against the wishes of her husband, believing that somehow it will help flesh out the mystery of why Sharon is plagued by nightmares of the town.  It follows the main storyline of the first game and includes many canon characters from the game with the inclusion of many non-canon charcters.  I was not upset or perturbed by this by no means.  I thought it was an excellent idea on the director's part to mix and blend his ideas with what the series has already established.Similar to the game, Rose and Sharon are involved in a car crash after racing to the town by taking a closed road, which alerts the concern of patrolling officer Cybil Bennet(canon) who attempts to stop her.  After an undetermined amount of time after the crash, Rose awakes in the fog laden town with ash falling from the sky...Sharon is no where in sight.  Thus, the movie really begins.The film includes many key elements and characters from the series, but it isn't all copied from the game. The movie takes a life of its own, but it keeps the plot grounded to what the fans were familiar with from the game with the main goal of finding the missing daughter of the protagonist and hopefully escaping from the town.  There is some interesting back story about the origin of Sharon nostalgic to the Alessa/Cheryl/Heather element also.I love how the director portrayed the town as like an alternate dimension/world disconnected yet still apart of the real world. We see this in the scenes involving Rose's husband and a detective who are in the real deserted town(due to the hazard of the coal fire burning underground) compared to Rose and Cybil who are trapped in 'alternate' Silent Hill.I also love how this film, unlike the Resident Evil films(which I also like), has a lot of familiarity of the game such as locations like Midwich Elementary, Grand Hotel, and Alchemelia Hospital.  There are familiar characters and villians, along with the music from Akira Yamaoka. I don't care if the movie wasn't an exact replica of the game or not, because that's not what I wanted, I just wanted a movie with solid acting, good scares, and an engaging plot.  This movie delivered that to me and I have no complaints, save for a few...Christopers Gans took some risks by including the fan favorite Pyramid Head in the film.  The movie follows the plotline of SH1, PH is from SH2 and many fans debate that this villian is somehow manifested in the main character's mind from SH2, and I agree, but I believe PH was added to the film for fanservice.There are many memorable and great scenes from the movie and I was surprised at how great the monsters looked without looking overly cheesy or unrealistic.  There is a fair amount of blood and gore scenes in the movie that are just as disturbing as the content from the game.  It's a great 'adaption' for the series and I belive many people who are not familiar with the video games will enjoy this film if they are fans of horror.The ending is a bit of a mystery and it may leave many viewers confused or open up more doors of theorizing about what really happened...",5,A Brilliant Movie Adaption of the Silent Hill Series!,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,4363,"['When', 'movie', 'was', 'released', 'back', 'April', '2006', 'was', 'more', 'thrilled', 'go', 'see', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'not', 'when', 'say', 'bad', 'mean', 'par', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'movie', 'bad', 'thank', 'goodness', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'great', 'even', 'dragged', 'cousin', 'who', 'somewhat', 'familiar', 'game', 'watching', 'play', 'sleepovers', 'theater', 'see', 'was', 'grossed', 'out', 'horrified', 'stunned', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'pretty', 'scary', 'even', 'movie', 'adaption', 'game.Video-game', 'fans', 'are', 'somewhat', 'hard', 'crowd', 'please', 'most', 'part', 'word', ""'adaption"", 'means', 'just', 'not', 'going', 'be', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'game', 'rehashed', 'bit', 'bit', 'Why', 'pay', 'money', 'movie', 'when', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', ""'m"", 'fan', 'series', 'just', 'take', ""'fandom"", 'waaay', 'too', 'seriously', 'video-game', 'movie', 'just', 'be', 'happy', 'sad', 'sack', 'director', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'House', 'Dead', 'Alone', 'Dark', 'BloodRayne', 'Doom', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'disgsting', 'mitts', 'project', 'then', ""'d"", 'really', 'have', 'something', 'bitch', 'about.Instead', 'male', 'protagonist', 'had', 'SH1', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'who', 'adoptive', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'wishes', 'husband', 'believing', 'somehow', 'will', 'help', 'flesh', 'out', 'mystery', 'why', 'Sharon', 'plagued', 'nightmares', 'town', 'main', 'storyline', 'first', 'game', 'many', 'canon', 'characters', 'game', 'inclusion', 'many', 'non-canon', 'charcters', 'was', 'not', 'upset', 'perturbed', 'means', 'thought', 'was', 'excellent', 'idea', 'director', 'part', 'mix', 'blend', 'ideas', 'what', 'series', 'already', 'established.Similar', 'game', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'are', 'involved', 'car', 'crash', 'racing', 'town', 'taking', 'closed', 'road', 'concern', 'patrolling', 'officer', 'Cybil', 'Bennet', 'canon', 'who', 'attempts', 'stop', 'undetermined', 'amount', 'time', 'crash', 'Rose', 'awakes', 'fog', 'laden', 'town', 'ash', 'falling', 'sky', 'Sharon', 'where', 'sight', 'Thus', 'movie', 'really', 'begins.The', 'film', 'many', 'key', 'elements', 'characters', 'series', ""n't"", 'copied', 'game', 'movie', 'life', 'own', 'plot', 'grounded', 'what', 'fans', 'were', 'familiar', 'game', 'main', 'goal', 'finding', 'missing', 'daughter', 'protagonist', 'hopefully', 'escaping', 'town', 'interesting', 'back', 'story', 'origin', 'Sharon', 'nostalgic', 'Alessa/Cheryl/Heather', 'element', 'also.I', 'love', 'how', 'director', 'portrayed', 'town', 'alternate', 'dimension/world', 'disconnected', 'yet', 'still', 'apart', 'real', 'world', 'see', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Rose', 'husband', 'detective', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'deserted', 'town', 'due', 'hazard', 'coal', 'fire', 'burning', 'underground', 'compared', 'Rose', 'Cybil', 'who', 'are', 'trapped', ""'alternate"", 'Silent', 'Hill.I', 'also', 'love', 'how', 'film', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'films', 'also', 'like', 'lot', 'familiarity', 'game', 'such', 'locations', 'Midwich', 'Elementary', 'Grand', 'Hotel', 'Alchemelia', 'Hospital', 'are', 'familiar', 'characters', 'villians', 'music', 'Akira', 'Yamaoka', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'exact', 'replica', 'game', 'not', 'not', 'what', 'wanted', 'just', 'wanted', 'movie', 'solid', 'acting', 'good', 'scares', 'engaging', 'plot', 'movie', 'delivered', 'have', 'complaints', 'save', 'few', 'Christopers', 'Gans', 'took', 'risks', 'including', 'fan', 'favorite', 'Pyramid', 'Head', 'film', 'movie', 'plotline', 'SH1', 'PH', 'SH2', 'many', 'fans', 'debate', 'villian', 'somehow', 'manifested', 'main', 'character', 'mind', 'SH2', 'agree', 'believe', 'PH', 'was', 'added', 'film', 'are', 'many', 'memorable', 'great', 'scenes', 'movie', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'great', 'monsters', 'looked', 'looking', 'overly', 'cheesy', 'unrealistic', 'fair', 'amount', 'blood', 'gore', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'disturbing', 'content', 'game', 'great', ""'adaption"", 'series', 'belive', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'video', 'games', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'are', 'fans', 'horror.The', 'ending', 'bit', 'mystery', 'may', 'leave', 'many', 'viewers', 'confused', 'open', 'up', 'more', 'doors', 'theorizing', 'what', 'really', 'happened']",N/A

However, I wasn't scared even ONCE during this film, not even at its most 'inventive' moments. The premise itself was dull (how many times are we going to be subjected to the worn plot of a disgruntled little girl who was killed off and is now seeking revenge - ""The Ring"" anybody?) and the execution seemed to be focussed on the special effects rather than the real elements of horror.Radha Mitchell is a gorgeous woman and she does a fantastic job here (considering she mostly had to act scared in front of a blue screen - pretty darned impressive). But theres only so much that can take you. By the time you wind through mazes and labyrinths with her trying to find her daughter - you realize that this film is not a horror film, but a very, very stylish adventure-mystery. If you take it for what it is, it could work.The end was very convoluted. I mean, this whole 'parallel universe'/'existential angst' thing works well and much better in some of the darker Japanese horror films I've seen. In the last scene on the sofa, the lead actress actually looks relieved that the movie is over. This was one element I had a problem with. However, the moods of the two parallel universes were beautifully captured as one was smoky and gray and the other awash in technicolor just to make a point.Heres the thing - I would not call this a horror movie. Most of its horror moments are just very funny (and unintentionally so) - for example a scene where the lead actress is mauled by a dozen or so burnt baby corpses that come to life and suddenly they all turn into ash. The CG on this wasn't very good. Either way, its better than other films in the genre when it comes to special effects.This was definitely better than ""Pulse"" and ""Sublime"" that came out around the same time. However, its still a C-Grade horror film. Keep that in mind before you rent it, and go in with very low expectations, and you might have a good time.",3,"A Worthy Stylish Half-Sister of ""The Cell""",1190160000,"09 19, 2007",2007,2373,"['have', 'never', 'even', 'seen', 'video', 'game', 'so', 'went', 'watching', 'advantage', 'being', 'totally', 'unbiased', 'said', 'wonderfully', 'shot', 'film', 'Very', 'atmospheric', 'times', 'reminded', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'Sleepy', 'Hollow', 'minus', 'charm', 'many', 'scenes', 'rivalled', 'Tarsem', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'starrer', 'Cell', 'visual', 'excellence', 'movie', 'should', 'definitely', 'watch', ""'real"", 'horror', 'story', 'Im', 'sure', 'know', 'However', 'was', ""n't"", 'scared', 'even', 'ONCE', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'most', ""'inventive"", 'moments', 'premise', 'was', 'dull', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'subjected', 'worn', 'plot', 'disgruntled', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'off', 'now', 'seeking', 'revenge', 'Ring', 'anybody', 'execution', 'seemed', 'be', 'focussed', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'real', 'elements', 'horror.Radha', 'Mitchell', 'gorgeous', 'woman', 'fantastic', 'job', 'here', 'considering', 'mostly', 'had', 'act', 'scared', 'front', 'blue', 'screen', 'pretty', 'darned', 'impressive', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'take', 'time', 'wind', 'mazes', 'labyrinths', 'trying', 'find', 'daughter', 'realize', 'film', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'very', 'very', 'stylish', 'adventure-mystery', 'take', 'what', 'could', 'work.The', 'end', 'was', 'very', 'convoluted', 'mean', 'whole', ""universe'/'existential"", 'angst', 'thing', 'works', 'well', 'much', 'better', 'darker', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'last', 'scene', 'sofa', 'lead', 'actress', 'actually', 'relieved', 'movie', 'over', 'was', 'one', 'element', 'had', 'problem', 'However', 'moods', 'two', 'parallel', 'universes', 'were', 'beautifully', 'captured', 'one', 'was', 'smoky', 'gray', 'other', 'awash', 'technicolor', 'just', 'make', 'point.Heres', 'thing', 'would', 'not', 'call', 'horror', 'movie', 'Most', 'horror', 'moments', 'are', 'just', 'very', 'funny', 'unintentionally', 'so', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'lead', 'actress', 'mauled', 'dozen', 'so', 'burnt', 'baby', 'corpses', 'come', 'life', 'suddenly', 'turn', 'ash', 'CG', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'way', 'better', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'when', 'special', 'effects.This', 'was', 'definitely', 'better', 'Pulse', 'Sublime', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'However', 'still', 'C-Grade', 'horror', 'film', 'Keep', 'mind', 'rent', 'go', 'very', 'low', 'expectations', 'might', 'have', 'good', 'time']",N/A
1001761,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000GCFO08,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[3, 3]","I knew the video game existed, but when I watched the movie, I knew nothing of the context.  I wondered if someone such as myself, someone without a reference point for the story and scenes, would enjoy the film as much as a lover of the game.The story concerns a young girl, Sharon, who sleepwalks and, during her somnambulism, mentions the name of a town: Silent Hill.  Her adoptive mother, Rose, desperate for an answer that therapy and medication have not provided, takes her daughter to the town, which has since been closed down due to the unstoppable coal fires that burn beneath it, the result of an obscure accident that occurred years earlier.  This accident, it turns out, created deep spiritual scars that reveal themselves when the town is, periodically, drenched in an explicable darkness.  (Don't let the name fool you; there's a lot of screaming and moaning going on in this so-called ""silent"" town.)The town, of course, is a pit of misery, horror, and demons.  Shortly after arriving, Rose loses Sharon.  She goes on a desperate search for her daughter, and finds, instead, shape-shifting demons, a constant rain of ash, and a scattering of dangerously fundamental townsfolk.  It turns out that Sharon doesn't need help.  Rose does.Rose is aided in her quest by a policewoman (the story is almost entirely about the curative faith and destructive hatred capable in women; the men in this film are portrayed as completely impotent; there could, in fact, be no male characters at all and the film would probably work just as well).  The policewoman, Cybil, follows Rose into Silent Hill, intending to pull the mother over for some crime which is unclear (Cybil's motivation is later explained, but it still does little to justify Cybil's actions at the beginning of the film as she chases Rose into the town; for that matter, it is unclear why Rose doesn't simply stop and explain herself to the cop).  When they find themselves stuck in this hell together, they join forces to find Sharon and escape.This movie is one of the most visually compelling horror films I've ever seen.  Sure, there's gore, but in spite of its staggering volume, it hardly ever seems gratuitous.  There are a few exceptions to this.  Near the end, a character is killed (surprise!) in one of the single most disturbing and realistic depictions of someone being burned alive that I have ever scene.  Also, the final Scene of Vindication (for whom, I won't say) is necessary, given the nature of the story, but it goes on far too long, and is filled with the sort of unending and benumbing graphic violence that the movie had mostly, up to that point, only artfully hinted at.The key word there is ""mostly.""  This film is sure to offend and disturb more than a few viewers.  It's visceral cinematography is outstanding, but also truly gut-wrenching.  The squeamish should stay away.The acting and story, however, aren't bad at all.  And even if the story-line occasionally strays into Obviously-Based-On-A-Video-Game territory (Hello, Mazes!  Hello, Occasional Tricky Obstacles!  Hello, End Level Boss!  Power Up!), it is satisfying (in it's own right) for those viewers who aren't interested in role-playing games or first-person shooters.  Radha Mitchell is excellent as the desperate and horrified mother (although she does reprise a lot of the same facial expressions she employed in Pitch Black).  Laurie Holden (who appeared regularly on X-files) takes a little time to find her character, but once she does (taking off her sunglasses and that massive motorcycle helmet helps with this), she fills her niche nicely.I won't lie; although this film is mastefully done, its exquisite attention to detail sometimes comes across as over-the-top, and it can cause an emotional chasm.  I ended up being more intrigued by the film's limits and purposes than I was by the characters'.  This came flying back into my face in the movie's final moments, when character empathy becomes the most important element of the story.  Still, it's a balletic (and appropriately creepy) denoument, and, true to the title, it's pulled off without a word.",4,"Silence Is Golden ... or, er ... not",1163721600,"11 17, 2006",2006,4127,"['knew', 'video', 'game', 'existed', 'when', 'watched', 'movie', 'knew', 'nothing', 'context', 'wondered', 'someone', 'such', 'someone', 'reference', 'point', 'story', 'scenes', 'would', 'enjoy', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'lover', 'game.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'young', 'girl', 'Sharon', 'who', 'sleepwalks', 'somnambulism', 'name', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'Rose', 'desperate', 'answer', 'therapy', 'medication', 'have', 'not', 'provided', 'daughter', 'town', 'been', 'closed', 'down', 'due', 'unstoppable', 'coal', 'fires', 'burn', 'result', 'obscure', 'accident', 'occurred', 'years', 'earlier', 'accident', 'out', 'created', 'deep', 'spiritual', 'scars', 'reveal', 'when', 'town', 'periodically', 'drenched', 'explicable', 'darkness', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'name', 'fool', 'lot', 'screaming', 'moaning', 'going', 'so-called', 'silent', 'town', 'town', 'course', 'pit', 'misery', 'horror', 'demons', 'Shortly', 'arriving', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'desperate', 'search', 'daughter', 'finds', 'instead', 'shape-shifting', 'demons', 'constant', 'rain', 'ash', 'scattering', 'dangerously', 'fundamental', 'townsfolk', 'out', 'Sharon', ""n't"", 'need', 'help', 'Rose', 'does.Rose', 'aided', 'quest', 'policewoman', 'story', 'almost', 'entirely', 'curative', 'faith', 'destructive', 'hatred', 'capable', 'women', 'men', 'film', 'are', 'portrayed', 'completely', 'impotent', 'could', 'fact', 'be', 'male', 'characters', 'film', 'would', 'probably', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'well', 'policewoman', 'Cybil', 'Rose', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'intending', 'pull', 'mother', 'crime', 'unclear', 'Cybil', 'motivation', 'later', 'explained', 'still', 'little', 'justify', 'Cybil', 'actions', 'beginning', 'film', 'Rose', 'town', 'matter', 'unclear', 'why', 'Rose', ""n't"", 'simply', 'stop', 'explain', 'cop', 'When', 'find', 'stuck', 'hell', 'together', 'join', 'forces', 'find', 'Sharon', 'escape.This', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'compelling', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Sure', 'gore', 'spite', 'staggering', 'volume', 'hardly', 'ever', 'gratuitous', 'are', 'few', 'exceptions', 'end', 'character', 'killed', 'surprise', 'one', 'single', 'most', 'disturbing', 'realistic', 'depictions', 'someone', 'being', 'burned', 'have', 'ever', 'scene', 'Also', 'final', 'Scene', 'Vindication', 'whom', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'necessary', 'given', 'nature', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'filled', 'sort', 'unending', 'benumbing', 'graphic', 'violence', 'movie', 'had', 'mostly', 'up', 'point', 'only', 'artfully', 'hinted', 'at.The', 'key', 'word', 'mostly', 'film', 'sure', 'offend', 'disturb', 'more', 'few', 'viewers', 'visceral', 'cinematography', 'outstanding', 'also', 'truly', 'gut-wrenching', 'squeamish', 'should', 'stay', 'acting', 'story', 'however', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'even', 'story-line', 'occasionally', 'Obviously-Based-On-A-Video-Game', 'territory', 'Hello', 'Mazes', 'Hello', 'Occasional', 'Tricky', 'Obstacles', 'Hello', 'End', 'Level', 'Boss', 'Power', 'Up', 'satisfying', 'own', 'right', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'interested', 'role-playing', 'games', 'first-person', 'shooters', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'excellent', 'desperate', 'horrified', 'mother', 'reprise', 'lot', 'same', 'facial', 'expressions', 'employed', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'who', 'appeared', 'regularly', 'X-files', 'little', 'time', 'find', 'character', 'once', 'taking', 'off', 'sunglasses', 'massive', 'motorcycle', 'helmet', 'niche', 'nicely.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'lie', 'film', 'mastefully', 'done', 'exquisite', 'attention', 'detail', 'sometimes', 'across', 'over-the-top', 'can', 'cause', 'emotional', 'chasm', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'intrigued', 'film', 'limits', 'purposes', 'was', 'characters', 'came', 'flying', 'back', 'face', 'movie', 'final', 'moments', 'when', 'character', 'empathy', 'most', 'important', 'element', 'story', 'Still', 'balletic', 'appropriately', 'creepy', 'denoument', 'true', 'title', 'pulled', 'off', 'word']",N/A

This film works on a lot of different levels and you have to go back through it in your mind before you realize that the story does work and make sense.  ALL of the actors are very strong in their roles - solid acting all the way around.The feel of the town of Silent Hill reminded me of what I was feeling when I read HP Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Out of Innsmouth"".The costumes are so effective it becomes very hard to discern the line between live-action and CGI effects.One warning - much of the imagery is very nightmarish and disturbing - but it isn't really gore - can you get your head aound that?  It's like being dropped square in the middle of a Hieronymus Bosch painting that has come to life.Excellent, haunting and disturbing.Follow-up:  Just watched Silent Hill a second time.  In some respects it was even better because I could focus on the incredible imagery instead of trying to follow the story and plotline.  The acting, the sets, the effects, and the music score are pretty close to perfection.  Silent Hill definitely raises the bar for excellence in the horror film genre.

So I'll give you a quick summary of the plot. Rose(Radha Mitchell) takes her sleepwalking daughter sharon to the place she keeps mentioning; Silent Hill. On her way there(after running from the law) she gets into a minor car accident and wakes up and discovers Sharon is missing and goes to find her in the ash clouded town of Silent Hill.O.k. the town of Silent hill is like a roach motel for people, they check in but don't check out. Once entered in Silent Hill, I didn't get the feeling of Forbodding right away, it was more dreamscapey and mysterious. By day Silent hill is foggy with ash falling from the sky like snow, and at night(Heralded by air raid horns from the church) its transformed into Hell, and quick.  The transformation of Silent Hill happens right before your eyes, and the effect are pretty good. This Hellish realm looks like who ever created it(for the film and I'm sure the video game) took page from Clive Barkers Hellraiser. Or from his Tortured Souls action figure line. Hell in Silent hill is a twisted place filled with disfigured abominations galore, burnt mutants, creepy crawlies and one big Mutha of a Hell enforcer, walk tall and carry  big--no no scratch that a Huge Sword.This film had a lot of interesting camera angles.  Shot looking down at the characters. Wide pans on a tilt to show the vastness of some of the interiors, and some cool composites showing stuff in the foreground and in the distance. To me some of these scenes look as if they could have a comic book border around them. The only thing missing was the caption bubbles.  For those of you looking to be scared, you know, stuff jumping out at you, loud noises and such, forget it, its not that type of film. It is however a creepy film. Once things are revealed to you it starts to get under your skin.And for those of you looking to check out the Gore in this movie, yes there is some gore, its not gratuitous as some other films. However, some of the gore effects that take place near and around the end of the film are pretty twisted even if they are computer generated.Sean Bean is in this film as Chis De Silva Roses' husband, while she is looking for the Daughter Sharon, He is looking for Rose, and there is an interesting juxtaposition between the real world and the Purgatory that is the Ghost town of Silent hill, as they are both in the same place, but not together.  Alice Krige plays Claudia, leader of the Silent hill moral majority who is more like a witch hunter than anything else.  I thought she did a great job creepy religious fanatic, those of you who can't place what other horror movie she was in may remember her in ""Sleepwalkers"" as the creepy shapeshifting  Mother who hates cats.  Laurie Holden plays officer Cybil Bennet, cool character.You may remember her as Debbie, Ben Grimms Girl in the beginning of the Fantastic Four.(or not)I imagine that the time rose spent investigating the town had something to do with the Video game.  That, I thought was the only thing that was slow in this movie, not uninteresting, just a little slow. I would have like to seen some more of the horrors that the night time brought out, because those scenes were pretty damn cool.Bottom Line.....highly entertainig, Excellent visuals.

1001769,A1VCPMT1RRS7K0,B000GCFO08,Matt,"[3, 5]","Given the trailers I'd seen and the creepy radio commercials I'd heard for this movie, I was expecting a fairly freaky viewing experience, yet I was also expecting to be let down, somewhat. Most times I'm expecting a movie to be disturbing, it turns out that the hype is highly overstated.Silent Hill starts out and it feels as though they are forcing the storyline a bit.. It has a deliberate and unexplained feeling to it, which isn't necessarily bad- so I gave it a chance, but I wasn't hopeful. The daughter, Sharon, talks about Silent Hill while sleepwalking and the husband doesn't think to research it until after the mother, Rose, has already taken Sharon to find the mysterious town. Along the way, Rose ditches a cop who is attempting to pull her over - another plot point that seems unnecessary.Ok, so Rose crashes the car and awakens to learn that Sharon is missing. It snows ashes in Silent Hill- and it appears to be uninhabited... or so it would seem... dun dun dunnnn.Rose seems to be a bit too calm and collected while underground, looking for Sharon beneath the streets of Silent Hill. Finally, a freaky scene... Rose stumbles upon a man that has been disemboweled, but remains alive, hanging on a fence. Then, we finally see the ""ghouls"" of the mysterious town, as they close in and swarm Rose. They seem to be people made of ashes, if that makes any sense. The CGI is very apparent for these characters and I didn't find them to be particularly creepy or disturbing. Pretty cheesy.The father follows, now a day behind Rose and Sharon, to Silent Hill. The movie gets stranger, but not too much more interesting. The pace is very slow. I realize that this was done deliberately, but it does drag along. The next good scene occurs outside of the church, as the townspeople who suddenly appear out of nowhere flee for refuge from the ""darkness"". The demon of darkness is a bad mofo, and this scene is gruesome, although brief.Here, inside the church, is where the ridiculous story begins to unfold. A story of religious fanatics and claims of witchery. The story is eventually fed to you (done in replay style, where you're shown grainy footage of what happened in the town's ""dark"" past). This feels like a copout, as I was hoping this revelation would be far more dramatic.The climax of the movie is gory and I would say it's pretty decent. The effects are also noteable, but I was honestly not impressed with the movie. I had a difficult time feeping my interest focused, even though this movie, I thought, would be right up my alley.",2,"""Honey, sometimes when you go to sleep you talk about a place""",1157068800,"09 1, 2006",2006,2553,"['Given', 'trailers', ""'d"", 'seen', 'creepy', 'radio', 'commercials', ""'d"", 'heard', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'fairly', 'freaky', 'viewing', 'experience', 'yet', 'was', 'also', 'expecting', 'be', 'let', 'down', 'somewhat', 'Most', 'times', ""'m"", 'expecting', 'movie', 'be', 'disturbing', 'out', 'hype', 'highly', 'overstated.Silent', 'Hill', 'out', 'are', 'forcing', 'storyline', 'bit..', 'deliberate', 'unexplained', 'feeling', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'bad-', 'gave', 'chance', 'was', ""n't"", 'hopeful', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'sleepwalking', 'husband', ""n't"", 'think', 'research', 'mother', 'Rose', 'already', 'taken', 'Sharon', 'find', 'mysterious', 'town', 'way', 'Rose', 'cop', 'who', 'attempting', 'pull', 'plot', 'point', 'unnecessary.Ok', 'so', 'Rose', 'crashes', 'car', 'learn', 'Sharon', 'missing', 'ashes', 'Silent', 'Hill-', 'be', 'uninhabited', 'would', 'seem', 'dun', 'dun', 'dunnnn.Rose', 'be', 'bit', 'too', 'calm', 'collected', 'underground', 'looking', 'Sharon', 'beneath', 'streets', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Finally', 'freaky', 'scene', 'Rose', 'man', 'been', 'disemboweled', 'alive', 'hanging', 'fence', 'Then', 'finally', 'see', 'ghouls', 'mysterious', 'town', 'close', 'swarm', 'Rose', 'seem', 'be', 'people', 'made', 'ashes', 'sense', 'CGI', 'very', 'apparent', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'Pretty', 'father', 'now', 'day', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'movie', 'stranger', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'pace', 'very', 'slow', 'realize', 'was', 'done', 'deliberately', 'drag', 'next', 'good', 'scene', 'occurs', 'church', 'townspeople', 'who', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'nowhere', 'flee', 'refuge', 'darkness', 'demon', 'darkness', 'bad', 'mofo', 'scene', 'gruesome', 'brief.Here', 'church', 'where', 'ridiculous', 'story', 'unfold', 'story', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'claims', 'witchery', 'story', 'eventually', 'fed', 'done', 'replay', 'style', 'where', ""'re"", 'shown', 'grainy', 'footage', 'what', 'happened', 'town', 'dark', 'past', 'copout', 'was', 'hoping', 'revelation', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'dramatic.The', 'climax', 'movie', 'gory', 'would', 'say', 'pretty', 'decent', 'effects', 'are', 'also', 'noteable', 'was', 'honestly', 'not', 'impressed', 'movie', 'had', 'difficult', 'time', 'feeping', 'interest', 'focused', 'even', 'movie', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'alley']",N/A

1001776,ATNX84AGYIN39,B000GCFO08,"Michael Roffman ""pinball wizard""","[2, 3]","Somewhere in the early '90s, a Hollywood suit said to another, ""Why don't we make a movie of this,"" while playing a round of Super Mario Bros. From there on out, moviegoers were 'fortunate' enough to have blockbuster video game adaptations every other year that usually fell under people's acclaim.Resident Evil or Doom, anyone?Roger Avary, one of Hollywood's braniacs and the one responsible for a little-known screenplay called Pulp Fiction, took on the job to adapt this year's video game film release, Silent Hill. The table was certainly sturdy, and all the right cards were laid out - especially when director Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) signed on to direct.However, the idea of a movie left an unsettling effect in my stomach. Silent Hill is by far the most terrifying video game to have ever graced a console. The game already borrows a handful of aspects from past films or literature (e.g. Jacob's Ladder and H.P Lovecraft, respectively) and in itself was a movie. The reason for a film fell under the jaw-dropping question, ""Why?""Both Gans and Avary have taken the mood, feeling, and scenery of Silent Hill and literally culled it from the game's platform. There are angles, characters and even set designs that are down to the T. The only problem is there is too much, even coming from such a simple storyline.Once upon a time...Rose, played by the gorgeous Radha Mitchell, decides to bring an end to Sharon's (her foster child) horrible dreams by driving to the abandoned, ghost town of Silent Hill. Along the way, Rose and Sharon bump heads with a do-gooder cop named Cybil. After a near death car chase between the two parties, Rose awakens after the car accident in the infamous town to no daughter and a mysterious fog. What lies behind the fog is for Rose to find out and the audience to wonder.Silent Hill follows the premise of the original 1999 game. Over the past seven years there have been four games from the series, and the downfall of the film is combining each and every element from those games. Everything is there in the film, which happens to be the major predicament. In fact, characters from the original film are split into two or three separate characters all revolving around a plot that becomes misconstrued and highly interchangeable by the film's finale.It's almost like Mortal Kombat: Annihilation all over again.Only here, Gans directs phenomenally. The sound effects are revolting and the special effects are minimal, something any director today should take note of. Silent Hill is, in fact, the same Silent Hill any gamer will remember playing on that old console years ago. Avary is no doubt a fanatic of the game, as all the choices the characters make are nearly the same as the average gamer's. I found myself jokingly saying, ""Maybe they should save soon."" It's a simple point A to point B which can bring out point C, kind of like the regular jokes in Family Guy.One major setback is the total waste of Sean Bean's performance. His side story involves him looking for his wife, Rose, and the result is something interesting yet highly unnecessary. Instead, Avary should have stuck with the game's original design and kept the lead a male. Bean's the better of any actor attached to the film and is yet swept unnoticed. The film would have worked inordinately better with him in the starring role. Instead, the film borrows from any modern day horror film and features the distraught female lead with the creepy child that loves to draw fast (e.g. The Ring, The Ring 2, The Amityville Horror 2005, Dark Water, The Grudge, etc.).In areas where the film works, the storyline disrupts - so much so that you literally wonder when it will end. It starts out fresh and then somewhere around the middle, when dozens of Puritans ruin the isolated feeling of the picture, the film takes a nosedive.

1001777,A4RQ549E9K6B4,B000GCFO08,Michael S. Fleischer,"[2, 3]","Silent Hill, Sony Picture's adaptation of the popular videogame series, continues the entertainment industry's introspective exploration of disaffected and disempowered children, masquerading as dispossessed spirits, desperate to redress insidious abuses, sometimes at the expense of a parent's life.The film opens with Rose Da Silva's (Radha Mitchell) gambit to take her daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the enigmatically titled West Virginia town, against the wishes of her husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), in the hope of finding a spiritual cure for Sharon's mysterious illness. Its onslaught has conjured ominous bouts of sleepwalking, delirious repetition of ''Silent Hill,'' disconcerting memory lapses, and brutal artwork, all threatening to have Sharon institutionalized.En route, Rose and Sharon hazard upon an instinctively suspicious police officer, Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden).  Keen on following the pair into Silent Hill, after a brief encounter in nearby Brahams, the parties are caught off guard by the apparition of a young girl that figures prominently in their separate roadside accidents. Rose ''awakens'' to find Sharon missing. Flustered, she ventures into Silent Hill, on foot, where she believes she has glimpsed her. What she encounters there defies rational explanation. After reuniting with an infuriated Cybil, they navigate a labyrinth of streets and buildings in a dimensionally fractured environment that is enshrouded by powerful metaphysical themes, worthy of some of the best-canvassed creations of the late surrealist, Salvador Dali. Quarantined thirty years ago by Toluca County officials, Silent Hill still smolders as a noxious, ashen hell made more menacing by the shadowy din that periodically transfigures it, heralded by a bellowing siren atop the town's Church. The original coal fire destroyed countless lives-some less innocent than others-and its victims seem to confront Rose and Cybil as badly burnt children, disfigured nurses, contorted corpses, rodent-like insects, and mythical demons--including ""Pyramid Head""--a favorite of the videogamers. Most disturbing perhaps, is Silent Hill's cult of fanatical executioners, bloodthirsty witch hunters, led by beguiling Christabella/Valtiel (Alice Krige, in a role that exceeds the menace of her alter persona as Star Trek's Borg Queen).  More said would spoil the film. Notwithstanding, director Christophe Gans, and writers Nicolas Boukhrief and Robert Avery, execute a superbly crafted, and beautifully cinematographed, film with a brilliant flashback that satisfies nearly all questions about the unfolding mystery.Admittedly, I have never played the Silent Hill videogames. Despite witnessing grown adults shudder at its mention, I suspect the filmmakers' desire to gratify the gaming faithful with violent, if not familiar, imagery did the film more harm than good. The excellent ghost story and score that anchors Silent Hill deserves intellectual play in the disquieted minds of its filmgoers, not in excessively sadistic screen graphics. Gamers will likely disagree with this analysis, and it certainly is not my intention to begrudge them of their joy, but the film's over-reliance on visual mayhem eclipses the truly fine performances of the actors, and truncates constructive narrative and back-story that could have advanced the film's intriguing esoteric, social, psychological, and religious themes. The ""monsters"" and avatars that the protagonists defeat or heed in Silent Hill are metaphors for the less savory in society who impose, or taunt us through, corrosive cultural constraints, institutional obstacles, and personal dilemmas that can corrupt our sense of right and wrong, dissolve the lines between good and evil, and fail our better judgment. Those who are most malevolent threaten the collective good, which has taken the form of a lost and abused little girl in Silent Hill. Falsely accused of the ""sins"" of her mothers, she is to be sacrificed on the altar of heresy. The real fear in the film is the doubt we have in the protagonists' ability to save her, and keep other loved ones safe and alive, away from the fiery precipice.Inspired performances abound. Rahda Mitchell, as the emotionally distraught mother of a terminally ill child, connects with her on screen daughter and husband, and viewers alike. Sean Bean's frustration as an alienated husband, perniciously thwarted by a disingenuous detective, Thomas Gucci--whom actor, Kim Coates, seasons to perfection with small town mindedness--is genuinely believable. Laurie Holden indelibly impresses us as an abrasive, tough motorcycle officer, and Jodelle Ferland, like so many gifted child actors and actresses who have been featured, recently, in sinister tales of possession, raises the bar a notch with a truly mesmerizing interpretation that belies her beauty and innocence.",3,"The ""Jung"" and the Restless",1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,4867,"['Silent',

In the past year, my brother and I have played through all of the games in the series and we love them. We've owned the Silent Hill film adaptation for a long time and I was excited to watch it after having finally immersed myself in the world of Silent Hill.One of my favorite things about the film, and something I think is so important to note, is that they use a LOT of tracks from the games in the soundtrack. You get that intense, paranoid feeling while watching the movie because you had those feelings while playing the games and hearing that heavy, industrial music. Akira is a genius and I'm thrilled that they included his scores in the film.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm surprised that so many people dislike it. The only qualm I have is that the lead character in this is a woman - the girl's mother - while, in the first game, it's a man - the girl's father. But really, the changes are so minor, I don't think it's worth letting it ruin the experience.While watching, we could point out things we remembered from the games, particular scenes that were wonderfully grotesque, just as the games were. I think, as far as video game adaptations go, this is rather stellar. It stays true to the series, includes many of the infamous creatures (The Nurses, Pyramid Head - who's massively overrated and barely even in the games, anyway, but is, for whatever reason, a fan favorite), and the ending is, I think, brilliant.I have my reservations about the sequel, as it deviates a LOT from the third game (which is what it's mostly based on, following the daughter from the first game), but I'm still looking forward to seeing it, especially after enjoying this movie so much. If you're not a fan of the games, you may not like the film, and I think that's understandable.

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[2, 2]","This film meanders for a while in its attempts at spookiness and possibly also trying to satisfy video game fans--though I must admit that this movie convinced me that playing the game would be nothing more than playing _Resident Evil_ with another title.  The images at times are indeed spooky, though the mystery itself lingers for a while in appearing to be a typical movie of good vs. evil.What peaked my interest about this movie is that the mystery ISN'T typical, but takes an intriguing and well thought-out turn...but the film takes about an hour to get to that turn, and by that time I was already considering popping the DVD out of my player.  The film fortunately doesn't follow the bad horror-movie formula of taking forever to get to the creepy stuff, but it doesn't really present its most interesting aspects soon enough and could alienate viewers who might get a lot out of this by simmering too long in an appearance of plain-old horror.The movie starts out with a young mother (Rose) taking her adopted daughter (Sharon) to Silent Hill, West Virginia, because Sharon has been sleepwalking regularly and naming that town, though she has no memory of any of this.  At Silent Hill, Rose gets into an accident when a mysterious girl crosses her path.  When she wakes, Sharon is gone, but one of her drawings is left behind as a clue...and so Rose wanders into Silent Hill, a haunted town with a secret...It sounds as though the rest of the film would follow a typical horror-film plot: evil things prove to reside in Silent Hill and try to keep Rose from Sharon, but her devotion to her daughter triumphs in the end.The above is true in spirit, but exactly what is 'evil' in this movie becomes a pertinent question, as well as what proper justice is, as Silent Hill proves to have a more complex secret than most horror movies will care to explore.  Even Rose's devotion as a mother has its own price, but as I said before, its most interesting aspects don't present themselves until the second hour.  For what this film does by the end, I would give 4 stars, but its misguided beginning hour knocks the movie down a star in my estimation.Well worth a watch...just don't put too much stock in the first hour.A sad moment of this movie was to find out that Alice Krige does indeed age--Krige was the SCORCHING hot horror chick of the 80's with _Ghost Story_, and then to re-emerge as the Borg Queen in _Star Trek: First Contact_--that made ME want to be assimilated.  No doubt, she looked great for a woman in her early 50's, and she was by no means playing a sex symbol (which, let's face it, would have been creepy, since she was a puritanical religious leader), but still...to see her showing signs of age is just another reminder of my own mortality.",3,3-star review for what could have been a 4-star movie,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2767,"['film', 'meanders', 'while', 'attempts', 'spookiness', 'possibly', 'also', 'trying', 'satisfy', 'video', 'game', 'fans', 'must', 'admit', 'movie', 'convinced', 'playing', 'game', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'playing', '_Resident', 'Evil_', 'title', 'images', 'times', 'are', 'indeed', 'spooky', 'mystery', 'while', 'appearing', 'be', 'typical', 'movie', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil.What', 'peaked', 'interest', 'movie', 'mystery', ""N'T"", 'typical', 'intriguing', 'well', 'thought-out', 'turn', 'film', 'hour', 'get', 'turn', 'time', 'was', 'already', 'considering', 'popping', 'DVD', 'player', 'film', 'fortunately', ""n't"", 'follow', 'bad', 'horror-movie', 'formula', 'taking', 'forever', 'get', 'creepy', 'stuff', ""n't"", 'really', 'present', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'soon', 'enough', 'could', 'alienate', 'viewers', 'who', 'might', 'get', 'lot', 'simmering', 'too', 'long', 'appearance', 'plain-old', 'horror.The', 'movie', 'out', 'young', 'mother', 'Rose', 'taking', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Sharon', 'been', 'sleepwalking', 'regularly', 'naming', 'town', 'memory', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Rose', 'accident', 'when', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'path', 'When', 'Sharon', 'gone', 'one', 'drawings', 'left', 'behind', 'clue', 'so', 'Rose', 'wanders', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'haunted', 'town', 'secret', 'rest', 'film', 'would', 'follow', 'typical', 'horror-film', 'plot', 'evil', 'things', 'prove', 'reside', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'try', 'keep', 'Rose', 'Sharon', 'devotion', 'daughter', 'triumphs', 'end.The', 'above', 'true', 'spirit', 'exactly', 'what', ""'evil"", 'movie', 'pertinent', 'question', 'as', 'well', 'what', 'justice', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'have', 'more', 'complex', 'secret', 'most', 'horror', 'movies', 'will', 'care', 'explore', 'Even', 'Rose', 'devotion', 'mother', 'own', 'price', 'said', 'before', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'do', ""n't"", 'present', 'second', 'hour', 'what', 'film', 'end', 'would', 'give', '4', 'stars', 'misguided', 'beginning', 'hour', 'movie', 'down', 'star', 'estimation.Well', 'watch', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'stock', 'first', 'hour.A', 'sad', 'moment', 'movie', 'was', 'find', 'out', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'indeed', 'age', 'Krige', 'was', 'SCORCHING', 'hot', 'horror', 'chick', '80', '_Ghost', 'Story_', 'then', 're-emerge', 'Borg', 'Queen', '_Star', 'Trek', 'First', 'Contact_', 'made', 'ME', 'want', 'be', 'assimilated', 'doubt', 'looked', 'great', 'woman', 'early', '50', 'was', 'means', 'playing', 'sex', 'symbol', 'let', 'face', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'creepy', 'was', 'puritanical', 'religious', 'leader', 'still', 'see', 'showing', 'signs', 'age', 'just', 'reminder', 'own', 'mortality']",N/A

While that isn't such a bad thing in the video game world, when it comes to film, well, that's not really a good combination.  Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) directs the film adaptation of Silent Hill with Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction, Rules of Attraction) screenwriting, and the film is a faithful interpretation of the game series, but that's not always a good thing as we soon learn.  Radha Mitchell (Man on Fire, Pitch Black) plays a desperate mother searching for her missing daughter in the ghost town of Silent Hill, and wouldn't you know it that all kinds of ultra creepy things start happening?  Sean Bean plays her clueless husband searching for her whereabouts outside the town, and Deborah Kara Unger and Alice Krige are along for the ride as well, but they are clearly having more fun relishing in just how laughable this film is.  That being said, though the film's storyline is practically incomprehensible, the look of the film under Gans' incredibly stylish direction really is a sight to behold.  The CGI effects and makeup work are very well done as well, which is a shame because had Avery maybe added a little more to the story, Silent Hill could have been something special besides being another lame video game to film adaptation (but at least this didn't get stuck with Uwe Boll).

The film begins with the mother, Rose, and her daughter, Sharon, at a time when Sharon is experiencing bizarre dreams and hallucinations.  Sharon repeatedly mentions a place called ""Silent Hill"" in her dream state, and her adoptive mother decides to take her there to cure her of her apparent psychic conflict.  As it turns out Silent Hill is an old ghost town, and as the two drive towards it leaving the girl's adoptive father behind, a series of bizarre occurrences take place.  The mother is pulled over by a police officer but drives away.  Later, they have an accident while nearing Silent Hill, and when the mother awakes her daughter has disappeared.  The mother becomes frantic and begins running through the town searching for her daughter, who appears to be running from her.  However, it is while in the town that the mother begins to encounter various strange and dark secrets.  Apparently there are evil forces loose in this town and mysterious dark creatures begin to besiege her.  Running from these creatures, the mother returns to her car only to find the police officer waiting for her.  The officer arrests her; however, soon it becomes apparent that the two of them must do battle with the forces of darkness.  The setting for this film is very dark and evil, and the influence of the demonic is felt at every turn.  While battling these wicked forces and searching for her daughter, the mother and the police officer encounter witches and crazed women.  Ultimately they are led to a cult of strange fanatics who hold a dark secret.  Apparently a great evil has been unleashed upon this town, stored up for many years in the body of a girl who was burned as a witch.  From there the movie becomes even more bizarre and ultimately the mother must encounter the demon by herself after fleeing from the fanatics.  The movie features dark deformed creatures, a knife wielding demon, witch burnings, a split self, and an all-around dark atmosphere and setting which is extremely well-done.  The ending includes a twist and an ultimate mystery that remains unsolved.  For more than anything else, this film is to be recommended for its dark atmosphere which is sure to provide a frightening experience of the dark side.  For those who bravely face head on the dark nature of things, this movie is sure to offer not only a source of entertainment but also a thoughtful look into both the dangers of fanaticism and the darkness of profound hatred.

1001793,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000GCFO08,Only-A-Child,"[1, 1]","For a truly unique film experience check out ""Silent Hill"". As a fan of the games I expected to be impressed but anyone looking for innovative filmmaking and extraordinary (WOW) production design should find this film fascinating. I am firmly convinced that Gans and Avery have hit a home run here.For those who have never seen the game, ""Silent Hill"" is the best ever survival/ horror game series. It is difficult and confusing (a lot of mazes and D&D-like; details) so expect major disorientation at times during the film-which is a bit like actually playing the game.The acting was convincing, the editing extraordinary, and the atmosphere oppressive. Not 100% how I visualized it before viewing but even the differences tended to work in favor of the film.The town itself looked and actually felt familiar, unlike the mess they made of ""House of Wax"". This is definitely the sort of film best seen on the big screen with a theater sound system. Everyone should be totally creeped out.Enough said, more at this stage might spoil things so read on only if you have already seen the film or if you don't mind some spoilers.Dahlia Gillespie had a daughter (by an unknown father) named Alessa. Alessa became the town outcast until a bunch of religious nuts (led by Christabella) decided she was a witch and must be sacrificed to keep evil out of Silent Hill. Dahlia went along with this because she was afraid of her own damnation for having the child. But the ceremony went wrong and the nutcases were not just killed but sent to a netherworld between heaven and hell.The dark side of Alessa ended up in the same place but she was split into duel entities and the good part stayed in the normal world where she was adopted by Rose and Chris, and named Sharon. Sharon's sleepwalking is caused by her connection with Alessa who wants her to return to Silent Hill.On the way to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon arouse the suspicions of a motorcycle policewoman (Cybil Bennett). This happens because Cybil has been extremely protective of children since she saved a little boy from a psychopath. Cybil follows them to Silent Hill (once a coal mining town that was abandoned because of a burning seam of coal under the town). At the town limits a mysterious girl appears and both vehicles crash. When Rose and Cybil regain consciousness Sharon is gone.As they explore the abandoned buildings they discover a church with a warning siren where the religious cult hides when Alessa (presumably) causes a darkness to take over the town; for some reason the darkness and Alessa cannot enter the church. It turns out that Alessa sent her Sharon identity back into the world of the living to bring back someone (Rose) who can take her into the church where she can finally exact her revenge.Everyone is dead in the netherworld of Silent Hill, even Rose and Cybil-they don't know it yet but they died in the accident-because you can only enter the town if you are dead.

Good, because you will be pleasantly surprised to learn that, unlike every other video game-based movie ever made, this is a great film!  And it's a great film that fans of the game can enjoy as well as moviegoers who never heard of the game (or who have been offended by the drek that usually comes to the theaters in the guise of video game movies).Silent Hill is a ghost town that was abandoned in the seventies because of an underground coal fire and now haunts the nightmares of a little girl. In an attempt to help her adoptive daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), Rose (Radha Mitchell) takes her to Silent Hill and enters a nightmare-like alternate reality. Going any further into the plot would spoil the surprises in this film and the surprises are part of the fun.The creatures that inhabit this alternate Silent Hill are very disturbing and nightmarish and they move in a very fluid way that is both familiar and strange at the same time. Seeing them in action (and, unlike most horror films, in full lighting) causes an almost immediate flight or fight reaction until the rational side of your brain remembers that it's only a movie.Also on the plus side is the music of Silent Hill. Very creepy, very fitting, and, very good; at least half of the reason this film works so well is because the music and sound effects do so well in conveying the sense that something is moving just beyond your vision.There is a downside to the film and it occurs almost dead center in the film. The beginning and ending of the movie is rife with psychological-based horror, and creatures dredged up from the depths of nightmares. But the middle is where we get an explanation for what's going on and it's a jarring change of pace that, thankfully, doesn't last too long.But the rest of the film makes up for that one pacing stutter and the entire film comes together in a great conclusion that may or may not hint at a sequel.Silent Hill also accomplished two very important things; it proves that a video game can be successfully translated into a great film, and it restored my faith in the horror genre' by giving me real chills without resorting to cheap tricks.A must see!",5,My faith in the horror genre' was waning until...,1156291200,"08 23, 2006",2006,2231,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'movie', 'based', 'video', 'game.Still', 'reading', 'Good', 'will', 'be', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'learn', 'other', 'video', 'game-based', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'great', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'fans', 'game', 'can', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'moviegoers', 'who', 'never', 'heard', 'game', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'offended', 'drek', 'usually', 'theaters', 'guise', 'video', 'game', 'movies', '.Silent', 'Hill', 'ghost', 'town', 'was', 'abandoned', 'seventies', 'underground', 'coal', 'fire', 'now', 'nightmares', 'little', 'girl', 'attempt', 'help', 'adoptive', 'daughter', 'Sharon', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'nightmare-like', 'alternate', 'reality', 'Going', 'further', 'plot', 'would', 'spoil', 'surprises', 'film', 'surprises', 'are', 'part', 'fun.The', 'creatures', 'inhabit', 'alternate', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'are', 'very', 'disturbing', 'nightmarish', 'move', 'very', 'fluid', 'way', 'familiar', 'strange', 'same', 'time', 'Seeing', 'action', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'full', 'lighting', 'almost', 'immediate', 'flight', 'fight', 'reaction', 'rational', 'side', 'brain', 'remembers', 'only', 'movie.Also', 'plus', 'side', 'music', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Very', 'creepy', 'very', 'fitting', 'very', 'good', 'least', 'half', 'reason', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'music', 'sound', 'effects', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'conveying', 'sense', 'something', 'moving', 'just', 'vision.There', 'downside', 'film', 'almost', 'dead', 'center', 'film', 'beginning', 'ending', 'movie', 'rife', 'psychological-based', 'horror', 'creatures', 'dredged', 'up', 'depths', 'nightmares', 'middle', 'where', 'get', 'explanation', 'what', 'going', 'jarring', 'change', 'pace', 'thankfully', ""n't"", 'last', 'too', 'long.But', 'rest', 'film', 'up', 'one', 'pacing', 'stutter', 'entire', 'film', 'together', 'great', 'conclusion', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'hint', 'sequel.Silent', 'Hill', 'also', 'accomplished', 'two', 'very', 'important', 'things', 'video', 'game', 'can', 'be', 'successfully', 'translated', 'great', 'film', 'restored', 'faith', 'horror', 'genre', 'giving', 'real', 'chills', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'tricks.A', 'must', 'see']",N/A

Considering the overall history of videogame movie adaptations, I was worried, but considering how cinematic Silent Hill was, I figured it wouldn't be that difficult to pull off.  However, when I saw the trailer and noticed that there would be a side-story involving people outside Silent Hill, I was heavily disappointed because one of the key things that makes Silent Hill the game so great is the fact that it feels utterly futile to think of any world outside of it.Well, my disappointment was misfounded, they actually did that sidestory pretty well, and it didn't affect the overall grade of the movie at all.  All in all, this movie exceeded my expectations for it, though it still left me craving for a little more.A big dilemma in the creation of this film is the fact that it seems almost required to hold some of those coded horror-genre elements that tend to be a turn-off to even the average film-goer: horror-film style acting (sure they can scream, but can they pronounce emotion otherwise?), some very campy dialog at points (Cop: ""They say this town is haunted.""  protagonist: ""I think they're right."" Audience: ""Ughhh...""), and the decision over what would be more scary, to actually show the terrifying elements or allow the audience's imagination to go wild.  Sometimes it was successful, sometimes it wasn't.I can say this about it: it could have used a bit less audio, both in terms of dialog and music.  Sometimes it just felt like the music was making it less scary, and some of the expository dialog was pretty much unnecessary: most of the dialog between the male cop and the husband, or that moment when the protagonist looks at the smudge on her finger and says ""Ash...""  Yeah, we know it's ash.  Now on with the imagery and off with the sound!Also, Pyramidhead's appearance was glaringly gratuitous, for no other reason than the plot didn't fully develop his character and thus he was pretty much there for the Silent Hill gamer fan to say, ""All right now on with the good stuff!""  It must be noted, however, that it was some very, VERY good stuff, so his appearance wasn't totally wasted.But all in all, it gets enough of the mood, enough of the setting, and enough of the imagery in that it's a pretty decent film.

1001810,A1PIFI7VXW78ZA,B000GCFO08,Ramon Olivo,"[10, 18]","I'm paraphrasing here but Kurosawa once said that if you have a great director, great editor, great cinematographer and a great cast but have a bad script then you will have a bad movie. This film is a great example to back up this statement. This film has some of the best visual effects out there, good editing, good cinematography, occasionally good soundtrack but an absolutely horrible screenplay. What happened? I wish I knew but could only guess that what we saw was the end result of a rough draft. Somewhere hidden in there might have been a good idea and it seems that unless you played the games it might be difficult to pin point exactly what that good idea was.In order for a movie to be good it should not require an outside source (video game, comic book, novel or TV show) to hold it up. Some of the best films out there were based off of another medium, Spiderman 1 and 2, X-MEN 1 and 2, Batman Begins, Lord of the Rings (this list could actually go on forever), I even enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat. Obviously you don't have to agree with the titles I just mentioned, they're just opinions but the point is that these films don't require you to be familiar with the source material. The films actually stand on their own without that familiarity. There's nothing wrong with the director tipping his hat to memorable scenes that originate within the game as a wink towards the fan. What is wrong is when the director is not able to translate the games narrative into film for the non-fans. If he were successful in translating the game into film the non-fans would want to play the game! In this case Gans failed to do just that.Is the movie hard to understand? No, because the main point of the plot, that is, the motivating factor for the characters in the plot is spelled out for you in the last 10 or so minutes of the film in the form of a flash back with running commentary. I can't help but think that the logic behind this plot structure is to make you feel like you've painstakingly played a video game and now you will be rewarded with a reason as to why you have played the game in the first place or why you sat for almost two hours wondering why Rose (the mother character for those who have not seen it yet) didn't take the kid to a doctor instead of taking her to an allegedly haunted town that is to this day burning underneath. The point is that this type of exposition is just plain lazy writing. That kind of information is typically (not always but in this way it is more challenging for the writer and allows for interactivity from the audience) leaked throughout the film with the use of action, dialogue, metaphors so when the payoff happens there is no need for an explanation.Tension is caused by expectation, you expect something terrible to happen based off the clues that have been given to you throughout the course of the film. Sometimes the audience knows more than the main character raising the bar for tension. In other words you know what's coming before the character does causing the audience to scream the typical, ""don't go into that room"" or ""Don't open that door"" or just simply scream. Alfred Hitchcock has a better explanation as to how it works but the point is that tension is caused by expectation. Now putting aside the information that the fans are familiar with from the game, the movie itself does not clearly place any clues for the audience to create that tension. The clues that are presented are a mystery in of themselves. Although we eventually learn of the witch hunters origin and eventually, after the infamous flashback, we learn the story of Alessa, without some form of previous information placed earlier in the film it's difficult for most to see any of that coming. Therefore, the director literally has to hold our hands throughout the film for us to understand why anything is happening. But yes, by the end of the film you are TOLD everything and technically you should be able to walk out of the film ""getting it"". However, in this case, to ""get it"" was not fun.I'm not going to argue about this being one of the best VG adaptations out there because it probably is. But unfortunately that's not saying much.What I'm saying is I love video games and I really wanted to enjoy this film. Besides, I'm a huge fan of Brotherhood of the Wolf and based on that alone I thought this film was going to be great. I thought it was going to do for video games what X-MEN and Spiderman was doing for comics, people were finally going to look at it as a serious form of entertainment and not a mindless activity that most critics have labeled it as such. Unfortunately, in this case it did not do any of those things. Even worse, it seems, based on the number of the games fan responses in this forum, the film has isolated itself to the entertainment of only them, thereby alienating itself from the rest of the public and some are okay with this! That's not a good thing and you fans of the game should know that money ultimately rules this industry. If this film does not profit it will scare off the studios from not only making sequels of this movie but ultimately making future adaptations of other games. And there are a lot of games out there that deserve to be made into films.",1,Another video game adaptation gone down the toilet and believe me I'm not happy about that,1208995200,"04 24,

The begining was done well you really get the same kinda feel you did when you were playing Silent Hill. As for the next 45 minutes or so I thought it was poorly done. You get alot of running around and pointless dialoge and not enough of Silent Hill. The monsters or whatever they are were too computer generated and Pyramid Head sucks and is only in 2 scenes.

1001814,A3W13VVBRY5GL7,B000GCFO08,"Review Lover ""ReviewLover""","[3, 5]","SILENT HILLI'm going to forget that this was based on a series of videogames for a minute, and for one simple reason: I love the games; therefore, my expectations of this film would kill its chances ever before we get to looking at 'Silent Hill' as a movie in its own right. What I'm going to tell you about instead is 'Silent Hill', a standalone new horror movie.Rose and Christopher Da Silva's daughter Sharon is in trouble: prone to extreme bouts of sleepwalking and night terrors, she keeps crying out the name of a town near to the orphanage where she was adopted: Silent Hill. With her medications not working and her parents at their wits' end, desperate mom Rose decides a return trip to Silent Hill is in order. Going against Christopher's wishes, she meets and angers a cop named Cybil Bennett, shortly before crashing her car. Coming to, she notices that her daughter is nowhere to be found, and must plumb the depths of the abandoned town in order to find her child.Actors in 'Silent Hill' are a VERY mixed bunch: while Radha Mitchell does a good job in the role of Rose, Laurie Holden works very well as Cybil Bennett and Alice Krige is great as cult leader Christabella, the rest of the cast are either throwaway and forgettable (Sean Bean as Christopher, Tanya Allan as Anna and Kim Coates as Officer Gucci), or just plain bad (Joelle Ferland's performance is overstated and hammy, there are better child actors around; and all of the cult members just plain stink - they behave like stock players from a 1970s B-Movie).Things are not helped by an oftentimes unintentionally funny script: lines like ""Look at me! I'm burning! "", or ""Burn the Witch! "" made me giggle to myself in the theatre - and in a movie that layers on the atmosphere as thickly as 'Silent Hill', this is a real problem. When the dialogue isn't pedestrian, as it almost always is, it's just plain outlandish. It's not a good script, it's not even always mediocre: sometimes, it's so bad that you have to laugh.This disparity continues with the storyline. What essentially begins as an isolated no-way-out plot is very quickly dampened by the introduction of more and more human characters. The cult members and their campy, Monty Python-style howlings (I kept expecting one or more of them to yell ""Build a bridge out of her!!"" when Christabella was denouncing Sharon as a Witch) remove all of the carefully-crafted sense of tension and isolation, instead turning the second half of 'Silent Hill' into a cheap 'Wicker Man' clone. Why bother having a deserted town, and building the plot and pacing on the back of a handful of central characters, when you're going to turn around towards the climax of the movie and remove these elements? The end of 'Silent Hill' loses its momentum badly, and, while the closing scenes are creepy, they can't rescue the overall impression of the movie as disjointed.The real star of 'Silent Hill' is the Production Design. Carol Spier has created a beautifully eerie background of deserted schools, churches and hotels against which the story is played out. But, as with the plot and the actors, the bad elements of this movie overpower the good, and sadly, Christophe Gans' extremely heavyhanded use of unnecessary special effects and cheap-shock camera shots does the gorgeous 'real' visuals a huge disservice. Case in point: the Janitor monster is a guy in a rubber suit, okay. It's unsettling to look at, moves in a very effective way and is generally a great visual element that adds to the fear of the scene he's in. Then along comes the computer-generated mess o' special effects and masks totally the creepy subtleties of the figure, until all we can see are obvious computer animations pumping away in the fore and middle grounds, and the fear is lost: put simply, we cannot see the scary wood for the humdrum trees.And it's a real shame. What could have been a great horror movie, a 'Wicker Man' for this generation - interesting premise, mostly solid central performances from the lead actors and a rare attention to set detail - is undone by its own frankly boring and unoriginal special effects, and many script and story problems that needed serious rethinking.For fans of the videogame: There's plenty in-jokes and references to the series, but Gans seems to have overlooked two vital elements that, at least for me, define the wonderful and original kind of fear you find in the games. One, you can see everything in all its gory detail: the sense of isolation and what-the-hell-is-that is totally lost to a too-big cast roster and flashy, cheap CGI. And two, the vibrant and distinct characterisation of the games is lost here to a boring script and generic stock players. Dahlia looks and acts like Tina Turner's Mad Max 3 character, had she been on smack. My favourite bubble-head nurses look like solar-power Michael Jackson's Thriller rejects, and Pyramid Head was not what he should have been. The cockroach storm and the skin-tearing scenes? Just another OTT example of the worst excesses of this movie.All in all, this is at best a mediocre horror movie with brief glimpses of interesting things, ruined by an over-the-top reliance on cgi effects, and a poor script. Not really worth your while; rental will be enough for most of you.",2,Disappointing waste of promise,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,5276,"['SILENT', 'HILLI', ""'m"", 'going', 'forget', 'was', 'based',

The one thing most people dont realize however, is that Silent hill plays off of the fact that there will always be more quiestions than answers. Don't watch this movie and expect to get the plot the first time around. In fact, dont ever intend to watch and understand, it just sinmple wasnt meant to be, which is why there are 4 games to date [and with the movie, im sure its creator's are thinking up of another one].in contrast to the many ""Horror"" genre films out there, this movie is finally unique [much like the game]. It's not a slasher, suspense, or mindless scary movie, it's all three. Forget the Ring, Amittiville horror, the grudge, white noise, and any other movies that were supposed to be scary these past two or three years, this one is in a league all of its own... alone.The plot, as you can deciefer in the first few seconds of watching the trailor, is about the main character [a woman who seems incredabily determind to do things her way] frantically searching for her daughter in a place called... yes you guessed it, Silent Hill. Other than that, the plot doesnt really change, sure there are a few hints and clues and climaxs telling you just what the heck's going on, but the underlying ""why"" of Silent Hill will illude you throughout and even into the ending credits. All in all, original for the way it is shown, and the sights and sounds of it all. Even the music can get creepy at times, now if only they did that more...This is the best adaptation ive ever seen to a video game. Even the feel and sounds make you remember the game as you watch, and while a movie will never amount to a video game, this movie got really close, but...there are a few lacking points as a FILM. For one, while many viewers may find the constant running and gasping of the main character as she runs around trying to find her daughter a bit repedative, this comprises 50% of the game play in the game... however, there is a hightend sense in the game, as you never know when something's going to try and eat, mutilate, bite, suck, or decapitate you. The movie however didn't produce such a feeling of paranoia, more like a few scenes here and there.For those of you who think Sean Bean's name means something in this film, sadly it does not. His character is a bit wasted [oops, did i say that out loud?], however, the way the movie was shown and set up, it's almost like they were deliberate in this action, as if a sequal was being made next. If not, then... Sean Bean was basically an extra. Don't get me wrong he displays exelent acting, however, he just isnt part of the action.If you havn't played the game, you might not understand it, but you may come away either totally apalled that you paid to see it/rent it/buy it due to the fact it just wasn't scary at all and you found it quiet funny [as i did the grudge and the ring], or you may think it was genienly scary enough to invite a friend next time. beware, this is a sixth sense type of movie, once you've seen it once, it just isnt th same the second time around, unless you totally forget the plot, or lack thereof.If you've played the game, then lo and behold the first movie based on a vide game that actually makes one want to play the game right after watching it. This isnt the movie that will change how people look at video game based movies, but it is a great step in the right direction [finally]. Now if only producers would get over there imortal terror of producing epic films, with a little extra flare here and there, maybe there would be even better films out there based on video games. Until then, Silent hill should keep you entertained for a little while.In all the movie there was only one scene that i found scary, and it was only because the movie theatre wasnt exacally packed, so i could totally zoom in and watch like i was there. Other than that, it never did get any scarier than that, but i still left the movie theatre and constantly looked over my shoulder once i got home... alone.If you've never heard about Silent Hill and just stumbled upon it at the movie store and rented it, hold on to the buddy beside you, and keep an open mind... and then dive into the video game, it is so much better. This movie is a good door opener to an already popular gaming series, but unless they make another one, and that one is BETTER than the first one, this movie will just be another one on the shelf after a few months.As a little girl expieriences life like dreams, and periodically sleep walks and screams ""Silent hill!"" one might get either a small chill, or a slight giggle at the opening sequence... the rest is, well... I give it three stars, because Having played two of the games, I know in my heart that the creator's/director... ok, the ""whole lot"" of people who wrote this movie, could have done much better. All in all, not a lost cause, just sorta...eh...",3,ehh....,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",2006,5186,"['little', 'girl', 'life', 'dreams', 'periodically', 'sleep', 'walks', 'screams', 'Silent', 'hill',

1001817,A1PUDOUADJGBBG,B000GCFO08,RHW,"[2, 3]","I was introduced to Silent Hill 3 by my roommate, who was a huge horror buff.  He had nearly every horror flick you could imagine, and the games to go with them.  Posters around the room foretold the end of the world.  Yet, all of this combined paled in comparison to the experience of playing Silent Hill 3, which made the grotesque look amicable, and made Jason or Freddy Krueger look like your after-school music teacher (which may be good or bad, depending on your music teacher).  I still remember how, while running through a subway corridor, the green/brown walls all of a sudden began to pulsate and drip with blood, only to return back to the sewage-filled, rusted facade three seconds later upon reaching the end of the cooridor.  We both looked at each other, and said ""WTF""!I tell this to the readers who are either new to Silent Hill, or have played the game.  To both readers, the above description is basically the ""allure"" of this franchise - you will have never seen such displays of utter horror - and this movie will not disappoint.  After watching this movie, all I will say is that I will never think the same way about an air siren again.To the former, it ends there.  The plot is skeletal, enough to justify the amazing scenery, and enough to please gamers who have immersed themselves into Silent Hill lore.  You will not find Oscar-winning acting, nor much rhyme or reason.  You may even be slightly annoyed (as I was) when the screen turns white, and someone begins a narration with ""Congratulations..."" as if you had just beaten a game, and are watching the ending.  My advice to you is to basically sit back, and prepare for a visual nightmare which has, until now, yet to erupt onto the big screen.To the latter, I really think everything good about the game is in this movie.  The plot may make a little more sense, and the similarities of Sean Bean to the Silent Hill 2 protagonist, and Rosa to the Silent Hill 3 protagonist, are uncanny.  There's even a mention of Alessa and ""rebirth"", which were central to the plot in 3.  The characteristic ""snow"" pervades the street-level, and the sick and unforgiving nightmare of the hospital is prominantly displayed.I give this movie 4 stars, and I'll tell a story to justify it:I saw my roommate playing Silent Hill 3, and I still remember him going through the church.  The map, the MAP, out of all things, spooked me so much that when I played it myself, I never got past the hospital.  The map is an innocent child's drawing of the church, and the juxtaposition of that with the climax of the nightmare that is Silent Hill 3 was a bit too much for me.  This movie does not come close to drawing out that kind of response from me - I'm sure due to the mainstream appeal of this movie - and for that reason, I cannot justify giving it a higher rating.  I saw this with both eyes open throughout the entire movie, and outside of those damned air sirens, found myself more fascinated than spooked.  Of course, my opinion may change while watching this movie alone in the dark...",4,A Game Adaptation Well Done,1146355200,"04 30, 2006",2006,3052,"['was', 'introduced', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'roommate', 'who', 'was', 'huge', 'horror', 'buff', 'had', 'nearly', 'horror', 'flick', 'could', 'imagine', 'games', 'go', 'Posters', 'room', 'foretold', 'end', 'world', 'combined', 'paled', 'comparison', 'experience', 'playing', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'made', 'grotesque', 'look', 'amicable', 'made', 'Jason', 'Freddy', 'Krueger', 'look', 'after-school', 'music', 'teacher', 'may', 'be', 'good', 'bad', 'depending', 'music', 'teacher', 'still', 'remember', 'how', 'running', 'subway', 'corridor', 'green/brown', 'sudden', 'began', 'pulsate', 'drip', 'blood', 'only', 'return', 'back', 'sewage-filled', 'rusted', 'facade', 'three', 'seconds', 'later', 'reaching', 'end', 'cooridor', 'looked', 'other', 'said', 'WTF', 'tell', 'readers', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'have', 'played', 'game', 'readers', 'above', 'description', 'basically', 'allure', 'franchise', 'will', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'displays', 'utter', 'horror', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'disappoint', 'watching', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'will', 'never', 'think', 'same', 'way', 'air', 'siren', 'former', 'there', 'plot', 'skeletal', 'enough', 'justify', 'amazing', 'scenery', 'enough', 'please', 'gamers', 'who', 'have', 'immersed', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'lore', 'will', 'not', 'find', 'Oscar-winning', 'acting', 'much', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'may', 'even', 'be', 'slightly', 'annoyed', 'was', 'when', 'screen', 'white', 'someone', 'narration', 'Congratulations', 'had', 'just', 'beaten', 'game', 'are', 'watching', 'ending', 'advice', 'basically', 'sit', 'back', 'prepare', 'visual', 'nightmare', 'now', 'yet', 'erupt', 'big', 'screen.To', 'latter', 'really', 'think', 'everything', 'good', 'game', 'movie', 'plot', 'may', 'make', 'little', 'more', 'sense', 'similarities', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Silent', 'Hill', '2', 'protagonist', 'Rosa', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'protagonist', 'are', 'uncanny', 'even', 'mention', 'Alessa', 'rebirth', 'were', 'central', 'plot', '3', 'characteristic', 'snow', 'street-level', 'sick', 'unforgiving', 'nightmare', 'hospital', 'prominantly', 'displayed.I', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', ""'ll"", 'tell', 'story', 'justify', 'saw', 'roommate', 'playing', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'still', 'remember', 'going', 'church', 'map', 'MAP', 'things', 'spooked', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'played', 'never', 'got', 'hospital', 'map', 'innocent', 'child', 'drawing', 'church', 'juxtaposition', 'climax', 'nightmare', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'drawing', 'out', 'kind', 'response', ""'m"", 'sure', 'due', 'mainstream', 'appeal', 'movie', 'reason', 'can', 'not', 'justify', 'giving', 'higher', 'rating', 'saw', 'eyes', 'open', 'entire', 'movie', 'damned', 'air', 'sirens', 'found', 'more', 'fascinated', 'spooked', 'course', 'opinion', 'may', 'change', 'watching', 'movie', 'alone', 'dark']",N/A
1001818,AFV2584U13XP3,B000GCFO08,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]",I really don't know why a lot of the supposed professional movie reviewers gave this movie such a bad grade if your a fan of the games or not it still was a great horrific movie.  To those who have played Silent Hill 1 through 3 we all know the basics of the storyline and of course with Hollywood producers there are going to be some changes in the movie that differ from the game.  This movie storyline does seem to follow-up with the first except instead of the father you have the mother coming to Silent Hill to try and help her adopted daughter remember her past that she has about Silent Hill.  Again if your a fan and played the game I'm sure we all remembered the Pyramid Head guy from the game he to will also be in the movie as well as a few other recognizable creatures from Silent Hill.

The name itself evokes powerful images of foggy, abandoned streets, decaying buildings, and surreal creatures.  No surprise, then, that the movie based on the games made sure to include all of these elements, and to do it well.  The film has its own failings and its own successes, to be sure, but it is most successful in establishing and maintaining the look, feel, and texture of the games.For the most part, the story also remains true to the spirit of the games. It is different in many details, but the themes and emotional resonance is the same. Pervading the film, just as in the games, is an overarching feeling of loss and hopelessness, confusion and panic. Right from the beginning the audience is offset and in unfamiliar territory, and that feeling is only built upon as the story is told.  The story of Silent Hill is always one of reality merging with the darkest of fantasies, and the viewer is left to sort out which is which even as the characters are assailed with discovery after shocking discovery.  Don't be surprised if you are left with more questions by the end of it than answers.While the movie is mostly consistent and delivers well on its potential, there are a few missteps.  Perhaps the most egregious among them is a drawn-out and overdone ""big finish"" ending, with lots of gory effects and violence geared towards satisfying an audience hungry for blood.  For those few minutes, the subtleties and nuances present until then are gone as a bloodbath ensues.  For those few minutes, what makes the games so great isn't there, and it works against the film too.The movie does recover itself, though, even after the awkward denouement of the action.  Returning once again to the spirit of loss and making an emotional connection that makes the games work so well, the final scenes of 'Silent Hill' are quiet and understated but undeniably creepy, effective, and tragic.  These last few minutes manage to redeem the film and end the story on just the right note -- a low, echoing, lonely note to be sure...but just the way it should end.As films based on video games go, 'Silent Hill' is quite probably the best of the bunch so far.  It maintains (for the most part) the spirit of the game while making a mostly-successful transition to a different medium.  The emotions, the look and feel, and most of all, the fear from the game are all there in the movie.  As scary movies go...well, to be honest, you've probably never seen anything quite like it.  And for that reason alone, it is worth watching.",4,Every town has its secrets...,1162771200,"11 6, 2006",2006,2788,"['secrets', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'are', 'buried', 'deep', 'hidden', 'years', 'raw', 'fear', 'protect', 'indicator', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'found.In', 'world', 'horror-themed', 'video', 'games', 'words', 'Hill', 'have', 'attained', 'special', 'status', 'name', 'powerful', 'images', 'foggy', 'abandoned', 'streets', 'decaying', 'buildings', 'surreal', 'creatures', 'surprise', 'then', 'movie', 'based', 'games', 'made', 'sure', 'include', 'elements', 'do', 'well', 'film', 'own', 'failings', 'own', 'successes', 'be', 'sure', 'most', 'successful', 'establishing', 'maintaining', 'look', 'feel', 'texture', 'games.For', 'most', 'part', 'story', 'also', 'true', 'spirit', 'games', 'different', 'many', 'details', 'themes', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'same', 'Pervading', 'film', 'just', 'games', 'overarching', 'feeling', 'loss', 'hopelessness', 'confusion', 'panic', 'Right', 'beginning', 'audience', 'offset', 'unfamiliar', 'territory', 'feeling', 'only', 'built', 'story', 'told', 'story', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'always', 'one', 'reality', 'merging', 'darkest', 'fantasies', 'viewer', 'left', 'sort', 'out', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'assailed', 'discovery', 'shocking', 'discovery', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'are', 'left', 'more', 'questions', 'end', 'movie', 'mostly', 'consistent', 'delivers', 'well', 'potential', 'are', 'few', 'missteps', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'egregious', 'drawn-out', 'overdone', 'big', 'finish', 'ending', 'lots', 'gory', 'effects', 'violence', 'geared', 'towards', 'satisfying', 'audience', 'hungry', 'blood', 'few', 'minutes', 'subtleties', 'nuances', 'present', 'then', 'are', 'gone', 'bloodbath', 'ensues', 'few', 'minutes', 'what', 'games', 'so', 'great', ""n't"", 'there', 'film', 'too.The', 'movie', 'recover', 'though', 'even', 'awkward', 'denouement', 'action', 'Returning', 'once', 'again', 'spirit', 'loss', 'making', 'emotional', 'connection', 'games', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'final', 'scenes', ""'Silent"", 'Hill', 'are', 'quiet', 'understated', 'undeniably', 'creepy', 'effective', 'tragic', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'manage', 'redeem', 'film', 'end', 'story', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'low', 'echoing', 'lonely', 'note', 'be', 'sure', 'just', 'way', 'should', 'end.As', 'films', 'based', 'video', 'games', 'go', 'Hill', 'quite', 'probably', 'best', 'bunch', 'so', 'far', 'most', 'part', 'spirit', 'game', 'making', 'mostly-successful', 'transition', 'different', 'medium', 'emotions', 'look', 'feel', 'most', 'fear', 'game', 'are', 'there', 'movie', 'scary', 'movies', 'go', 'well', 'be', 'honest', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'quite', 'reason', 'alone', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

The trailer looked shockingly good, but then again so does every trailer thanks to the highly advanced art of hollywood trickery these days. Additionally, I had never played the video game, and I wasn't sure if it was anything to get excited about. Luckily, my roommate was the one to splurge $20 on it and not me, and I got to see it.Despite the fact that they're churning out video games as fast as they can, most of which are helmed by the repugnant Uwe Boll, this is a solid horror movie. I have no idea how much it lifts either directly or loosely from the game, but it does provide some remarkable visuals and even better ideas. It's not reliant on pure atmosphere like The Ring or any of the J-Horror clones that have become so prominent lately, nor is it just one huge gorefest like the Nightmare on Elm Street series or Friday the 13th. Instead it walks somewhere in the middle while adding a nice adventure element that I'm guessing comes fairly faithfully from the game. It's refreshing that the movie isn't themed to the point that it's a one-trick pony, instead it brings out a new and exciting monster or revelation every so often to keep it fresh.All in all, this movie may not be 5 stars, but it does deserve the title of the best video game movie (or perhaps the only good one) to date.",5,"Not just good for a video game movie, but actually GOOD!",1158710400,"09 20, 2006",2006,1348,"['movie', 'had', 'hesitated', 'see', 'trailer', 'looked', 'shockingly', 'good', 'then', 'again', 'so', 'trailer', 'thanks', 'highly', 'advanced', 'art', 'hollywood', 'days', 'Additionally', 'had', 'never', 'played', 'video', 'game', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'anything', 'get', 'excited', 'Luckily', 'roommate', 'was', 'one', 'splurge', '20', 'not', 'got', 'see', 'it.Despite', 'fact', ""'re"", 'churning', 'out', 'video', 'games', 'as', 'fast', 'can', 'most', 'are', 'helmed', 'repugnant', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'solid', 'horror', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'directly', 'loosely', 'game', 'provide', 'remarkable', 'visuals', 'even', 'better', 'ideas', 'not', 'reliant', 'pure', 'atmosphere', 'Ring', 'J-Horror', 'clones', 'have', 'become', 'so', 'prominent', 'lately', 'just', 'one', 'huge', 'gorefest', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'series', 'Friday', '13th', 'Instead', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'adding', 'nice', 'adventure', 'element', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'fairly', 'faithfully', 'game', 'refreshing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'themed', 'point', 'one-trick', 'pony', 'instead', 'out', 'new', 'exciting', 'monster', 'revelation', 'so', 'often', 'keep', 'fresh.All', 'movie', 'may', 'not', 'be', '5', 'stars', 'deserve', 'title', 'best', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'perhaps', 'only', 'good', 'one', 'date']",N/A
1001824,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000GCFO08,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 12]","Silent Hill (Christophe Gans, 2006)I hope someone explains this to me, because I don't get it.There are three kinds of people who hated Silent Hill: the people who played the games and found the movie not enough like them; the people who have never played the games and couldn't follow the plot; and the critics, who, as a whole, haven't liked a single horror film in so long that by now it's a knee-jerk reaction. They, too, had a hard time following the plot.What I'm not getting-- how did anyone have a hard time following the relatively straightforward, actually quite simple, plot?Obviously, I can't explain it all to you without spoilers. But, really, folks, has your ability to connect the dots gotten that rusty? If so, I fear for the fate of modern society far more than I did on Friday before about 9:45PM, when I left the theater after seeing what I thought was quite the bang-up little film.I wrote recently, in my review of Slither, that it was one of the best horror films I'd seen in ages. And here we are getting Silent Hill in the same month. It's an embarrassment of riches. It leaves me with the hope, however infinitesimal, that someone in Hollywood has finally grown a brain. Two movies in one month that lead me to revise my position on the death of the American horror movie. Hollywood, I am weeping with joy, and for once, you are the cause. Thank you.Okay, here's what I can tell you. Now, if you saw the movie and couldn't follow along, pay attention. Rose (Visitors' wonderful, and criminally underutilized, Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy's Sean Bean) DaSilva have adopted a girl named Sharon (Kingdom Hospital's Jodelle Ferland). She comes from rural West Virginia. Sharon has nightmares, during which she sometimes (a) sleepwalks, and (b) talks about a place called Silent Hill. The condition is getting worse. Rose, in a desperate attempt to get to the bottom of Sharon's condition, decides to take her to Silent Hill, about which Sharon, when awakes, knows/remembers nothing. Christopher is not at all happy with this decision. On the way, Rose and Sharon attract the attention of Cybil (Fantastic Four's Laurie Holden), a local cop who thinks they seem suspicious (she explains why later, and if you found it out of character, folks, you've never lived in places that consider black swampy water potable) and follows them. While running from Cybil, Rose gets into a minor auto accident that knocks her unconscious. When she wakes up, the geography has changed slightly, and Sharon is gone. Rose, now on the outskirts of Silent Hill, must rescue Sharon, while, preferably, avoiding Cybil.If you missed any of that, I'm guessing you weren't paying attention, because all of it was actually explicitly mentioned in the film. In general, each facet of the above summary was mentioned only once, but none of the above summary was stuff I had to use any big leaps of logic for. There are things people have been asking that do require leaps of logic, but those, in general, are more gamer-geek questions than ""I didn't get the story"" questions. (The most common of these being ""why is Pyramid Head in this movie?"", one of the few questions being asked about the film that seems to be inspiring intelligent debate. My answer: because it's bloody cool, and Christophe Gans seems to think so, too. The movie doesn't have to be entirely faithful to the game; most film adaptations of books are, shall we say, not faithful. Like, they're cheating harlots.) If you weren't paying attention, don't criticize the film for being hard to follow. Your fault, not that of Gans and Avary.Whom I should mention, though their contributions were, in fact, somewhat mediocre. Director Christophe Gans (Pacte des Loups) and screenwriter Roger Avary (Killing Zoe) did a competent job with their roles. Avary's script was a bit heavy on the exposition, Gans' directing was just heavy. (Though, to be fair, I felt that way about Pacte... as well.) It's cinematographer Dan Laustsen (who also worked with Gans on Pacte...) and monster guy Patrick Tatopoulos (Pitch Black) who really give this film, once it gets going, something to sink one's teeth into.The acting is, well, standard. Which is kind of surprising, given the presences of folks like Mitchell, Bean, Alice Krige, and Deborah Unger. Mitchell takes the Naomi-Watts-in-The-Ring approach to acting (scream at anything that comes near you); Krige does the zealot relatively well, but lacks the air of menace that you know she's supposed to have before she gets to play the zealot. Unger turns in the best performance of the lot, perhaps her best since Crash ten years previous.But then, are you really seeing a movie like this for the acting? Or, for that matter, the directing or the script? Competence is good enough. As long as there's atmosphere, you've got yourself a movie, and what Silent Hill does have is atmosphere in spades. One of the few problems I had with Hostel was its rather abrupt shift in tone; softcore porn one moment, hardcore horror the next. Silent Hill is, on the other hand, a seamless blend of atmospheric horror flick and gore film, with more than a little mystery and psychodrama thrown in for good measure. This, of course, leads to lots of criticism; the atmospheric horror fans are blasting it for the amount of gore, the gorefeinds are saying there's not enough. I could've done with a tad more gore, myself, but I'm not counting points off for not having enough. Here, it seems to me, is the first really hard evidence that America is learning from Japanese New Horror, as opposed to simply remaking it or imitating it. (And while Eli Roth made a bang-up flick, Hostel really is more imitation than internalization.) All of the visuals, once Rose gets to Silent Hill, are aimed at throwing you off, if not always disturbing you. Nothing looks right, even those things that normally would. (Gans does kind of overplay this a tad in the scene with Christopher and Gucci wandering through the school, but since he's setting up a later shot, I have to at least partially forgive him; whether you will or not depends on whether you think that later shot is also overdone. It is, but only a touch, really.) You know something's not right, even before Rose does, and by the time she's figured it out, you're in full-on disturbance mode. Avary does a good job of spacing things out (e.g., showing us the miners, giving us a scene with the miners, showing us who the miners are) in the script so as to achieve the maximum disturbance effect, and again, as long as you're paying attention, you should be able to connect the dots just fine.Now, what I didn't tell you at the beginning of this review: I have never played the Silent Hill games. I was only marginally aware of their existence before I started hearing buzz for this movie, and as of now, all I know about them I know from the movie. So I am living proof that the ""you have to have played the game to understand this movie"" criticisms are wrong. I've barely even seen the boxes, and I thought it was loads of fun and easy to follow. The script was probably too subtle for a lot of people who saw it; I hope to all that's holy that doesn't lead Hollywood to start dumbing horror films down again. A lot of us did get it, and we're deeply appreciative that this script got through the way it did.I cannot recommend highly enough that you see this movie if you're a horror fan. See it on a double-bill with Slither, if you can; they're two aspects of what the Hollywood movie machine can do, if they either encourage or ignore folks who want to make movies that don't fit standard fare. Great stuff, both of them. ****",4,"If you don't get it, you're not trying.",1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,7697,"['Silent', 'Hill', 'Christophe', 'Gans', '2006', 'hope', 'someone', 'do', ""n't"",

The problem was I had minimal sympathies for the leads, and the movie producers take it for granted that you care very much for anything that walks on two legs. Perhaps that's the way life should be to care for our fellow man, but in movies it's a whole different category.  You have to connect. Without that, you simply watching someone else's journey, and that's how it was during this entire movie. I feel for people who are in pain or distress in movies but there are certain levels of rooting for the good guy. The major point is putting yourself in his or her spot, that is where the real fun comes in. However, in this particular case, I felt like I was a watcher in someone else's nightmare, and as struggling as she was to find her lost daughter, I didn't feel it was monumentally that important. I felt more importance in Dorothy finding her way home from the wonderful land of Oz. That is the real clincher with horror movies, if you don't empathize with the main characters, the struggle is lost.

The games are creepy to the extreme, and this movie manages to pull off the atmosphere perfectly.  Whether you are a game player or just a moviegoer, this film is a treat to the horror fan who loves an extra dollop of disturbing and sinister eeriness on their gore.Rose Da Silva (played expertly by Rahda Mitchell - Pitch Black, Man On Fire) knows there is something deeply wrong with her sleepwalking adopted daughter, Sharon.  Against the wishes of her husband Christopher (Sean Bean - Fellowship Of The Ring), Rose decides to take Sharon on a road trip back to Sharon's town of birth, Silent Hill.  Big mistake.After a run from police officer Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden - Young Catherine, Fantastic Four), Rose crashes her car on the border of the cordoned off city of Silent Hill, evacuated because of an underground mine fire.  When Rose regains consciousness, Sharon is gone and Officer Bennett is intent on arresting her.  That is, until the two women discover that Silent Hill is now shut off from the rest of the world by a gaping chasm.Rose and Cybil return to the town to look for Sharon, but the town is really messed up.  Signals over the radio and cell phones announce the coming of squishy, disgusting horrors, and the fallout siren announces the arrival of a strange, alternate dimension.  Sharon is still here, somewhere, and Rose will stop at nothing to find her little girl.This movie is ALL atmosphere.  The sinister ambiance, the gut-wrenching mood, will make you forget everything else.  The FX is great, not just with the surroundings but also with Mr. Triangle Head (who appears in a particular skin-ripping scene that will leave you retching or reaching for popcorn).  Alice Krige (Star Trek TNG as the Borg Queen) plays a very over-the-top religious leader to perfection.  And the ending will leave you gasping for air, if you have any breath left after your ride through this spooked out town.Note:  I couldn't help but hear Simply Red's song ""Night Nurse"" during Rose's foray into the basement.  You will see what I mean, then look up the song.  I'm twisted, but it fits.  'Silent Hill' is a definite purchase.

1001836,A3DC53MM1NGLBB,B000GCFO08,Sean,"[14, 16]","All the reviews of this movie have either been positive or negative. People seem to either love this movie or hate this movie; I for one am in the middle but leaning more (much more) towards like. Of course going into the movie with the information I had on it is also influencing my review.Rose cannot accept the knowledge that her daughter Sharon is dying of a fatal disease. Over the protests of her husband, she flees with her child, intending to take the girl to a faith healer. On the way, she ends up driving through a portal in reality, which takes her to the eerie and deserted town of Silent Hill. Sharon disappears in Silent Hill, and Rose follows what she thinks is her daughter's silhouette all over town. It's soon clear the town is not like any place she's ever been. It's inhabited by a variety of creatures and a living darkness that descends and literally transforms everything it touches. The human inhabitants - the ones who are left - are trapped and fighting a losing battle against the Darkness. Joined by a cop named Cybil, who has been sent to bring her and Sharon back, Rose searches for her little girl while learning the history of Silent Hill and that Sharon is just a pawn in a larger game...That's the premise of Christophe Gans' game to movie adaptation. I went in to this movie knowing the premise. I've never played any of the games in this series but I really want to. Gans' did a terrific directing job. The sets look amazing. Everything is beautifully shot and he uses some camera angles which I am going to assume resemble the games' angles in some parts. All in all, his directing job is very well done; you can tell he loves this series.The script for this movie has been under a lot of scrutiny. Ok, it's not perfect and yes, it does have some corny, cheesy and out of place dialogue but I looked past that. I could have used without Rose yelling ""Sharon!"" over and over and over and over again. I was expecting Ozzy Osbourne to pop up and share in the yelling.The acting is what you'd expect in this kind of movie. Who's here is solid, not the best but they get the job done. Mitchell does a great job as Rose while Sean Bean is just there. Jodelle Ferland is good as the child as well. The score is just ho-hum. It's not bad but it's nothing memorable. They use the ""Silent Hill Theme"" too much (don't know if that's the games' theme they're using or the movie's theme).The effects in this are top notch. The monsters are inventive and creepy. They're unlike anything I've seen. It also helps they're not all CGI. They're people underneath there and there's very little CGI used.Ok, now to the information on why I rated this a little higher than I normally would have. This movie's run time is 125 minutes (approx.). Things seem missing at some places and not everything makes sense at the end. That's because the original cut was longer than King Kong, it was 3 and a half hours! So yeah, lots of things were cut, I guess that's why I'm being lenient to it and not bashing it. I went in expecting that and wasn't disappointed. This gets a higher grade because I understood things got cut out. The movie entertained me anyways. So I wasn't fully aware of what was going on in some places but I was so wrapped up in the world I was drawn into that I really didn't care. That's kind of like Doom, it's an empty empty movie but it's fun. Silent Hill is a movie with a simple plot and things were cut out but it was fun. Was Doom a ""good"" movie? No. Was it a ""fun"" movie? Yes and that's all that matters for a flick like this. I didn't go into this movie expecting gold in the first place and I wasn't let down. I guess the biggest thing that irked me was the ending. I heard about this huge amazing ending that left the movie wide open for a sequel. Sorry, it didn't. Sure, the ending was damn cool but wasn't what I was expecting, which is my fault and not the movie's. I enjoyed the very ending cause we don't get full closure. The ending is enigmatic but it doesn't hurt the film. My other large complaint is that the Sean Bean character really serves no purpose. His scenes only detract us from Rose's situation, a world that we've become a part of and entwined in.So no, this isn't a perfect movie, not many are. And yes, things were cut out and that will cause people to be lost. Is this the definitive videogame movie? Far from it. But I went in knowing this wasn't Gans' true vision, just his best effort to put out what he was allowed and for that I congratulate him. He created a pretty alright videogame movie.

I did walk into the theater with low expectations, but kept my mind open. (About as smart as retrieving dropped soap in a prison shower, but I digress.) The movie is about a woman named Rose, whose adopted daughter sleepwalks near a waterfall piping out ""SILENT HILL! SILENT HILL!"" After about a minute's worth of online research, Rose heads to the ghost town with her daughter for some vague, subtext-explained reason. After Rose makes a brief stop, she notices the dubious foreshadowing of her daughter's once-adorable crayon colorings transformed into crude representations of blood and gore. The characters exhibit some obligatory shock, and continue towards Silent Hill. It would go against standard horror movie protagonist conduct to do otherwise, right? A cop who earlier wrote down Rose's license plate number follows her to Silent Hill, and disjointed scenes of mild intrigue follow. Silent Hill is an unapologetic exercise of style, intending to envelop the viewer in its dreary atmosphere to a level he/she doesn't notice the sterile script and generic ""I'm shocked! Now let's move on."" horror movie acting.Visually and aurally, Silent Hill is brilliant. The tainted ghost town drenched in fog is perfectly emulated, complimented by lucid camerawork and a melancholic soundtrack. The monsters themselves are somewhat creepy at first, (except the giant bug with the whimsical demon face) despite the fact that the CGI enhancement is too obvious. (CGI will always lack the depth and warmth necessary to be mistaken for flesh and blood.) I love the subtlety in how the creatures are presented, adding to the creep-out factor rather than the shock factor. On a superficial note, I was a bit let down by the lack of gore, or any real brutality, until the last quarter of the film. I understand Silent Hill is a mainstream movie with a regular R rating, but I expected a bit more considering the monsters were shambling lumps of pulsating flesh. Come on, give the audience a reason to be scared. Near the end of the movie, there's alot of blood and a certain Evil Dead-esque moment I don't think I can mention on Amazon, but the accentuating level of suspense in the amount of violence these creatures could inflict worked only to render the film somewhat visually unbalanced.This movie certainly evokes that bleak, gothic feeling of the namesake games, but utilizes the impeccable atmosphere to create a lopsided framework to rest a dark, but wholly forgettable Hollywood good vs. evil fairytale.

1001838,A13UAIE3K517CQ,B000GCFO08,sft,"[2, 2]","Silent Hill is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen. It is simply mesmerising to look at. The atmosphere is wonderfully dark, dingy, weird and creepy. A dreamlike (or more accurately a nightmare-like) serenity shrouds the deserted town, while just below the surface a terrible darkness lurks. The monsters encountered are truly disturbing, especially the Janitor, and the design of these creatures demonstrates the high level of creativity that has been lavished on the visuals. The effects are top-notch; you will never look at peeling paint in the same way again. Five stars so far, then, no question about it. So it's a real shame that the script lets the production design down. Up until the third act the mystery surrounding the disappearance of the little girl is deeply satisfying in its spookiness. Silent Hill is such a strange place you want the reason for all this suffering and evil to be equally unexpected and bizarre. Instead we learn, during a very long piece of exposition, that the town's terrible past is in fact a rather predictable, and disappointing one. Suddenly the eerie atmosphere is destroyed and the film becomes derivative. Even the spectacular finale can't recapture the mystery that the first two-thirds of the film so effectively created. Anyone who enjoys the work of David Lynch will know that weirdness can be used to great effect and doesn't always have to be completely explained away.

1001843,A1BAQVTLZB9CI3,B000GCFO08,Simone,"[11, 12]","The nations ""so-called"" top critics have been bellyaching for years about the current crop of horror moves.  They have whined and complained about those films repetitiveness: [...] teenagers/young adults being tortured and killed by a sadistic psycho, the lack of intelligence in those films, and those movies focusing on entertaining an audience with nudity, bloodshed, or a combination of the two.  So finally a horror movie is released that doesn't adhere to this standard and yet again they're still bellyaching.  Perhaps because some people can't be satisfied or maybe their negative reviews of this film stem from their inability to use their brains when watching a horror movie so they go out and wrongfully label this film as plotless and confusing.Since those ""so-called"" top critics failed to grasp the plot and were confused, I'll enlighten them a bit.  I won't give away any major spoilers since that would ruin the movie for people who have yet to see it, but I will put out some useful information on some stuff that to me is elementary, but the ""so called"" top critics seemed to not have not been able to understand (honestly, what are they being paid for).  The basic plot of this movie is that Sharon DaSilva is in the mysterious town of Silent Hill looking for her missing adopted daughter named Sharon DaSilva.  In the process of looking for her she is lead from place to place by an entity that is intent on using her to seek revenge.  What's so confusing about that?Other important aspects of the film that went over the heads of those critics was having a basic understanding of the fact that there are 3 worlds that exist in Silent Hill.  Those 3 worlds are reality, the other world, and the nightmare world.  Reality in the film is the world where the husband and Officer Gucci are as they try to locate Rose, Sharon, and Cybil.  In this world the town is abandoned because of the ash, smoke and forever burning mines that requires them to have to wear protective facemasks.The other world in the film is a foggy place where ash falls like snow.  It is in this world that Rose, Cybil and Sharon are first transported to.  It is a vastly empty place that is completely closed off from the outside world by cliffs.  The religious zealots-miners who like Rose, Cybil, and Sharon have been pulled here inhabit it.  It also contains strange, mal-formed creatures.Then there`s the third and final world.  This is a nightmare world.  But who's nightmare world is it? My recommendation is watch the movie and find out.  This world is a dark, and burned placed filled with the hideous creatures.  In this world a child molester appears as an S& M styled beast, there's a monster wielding a giant blade with a pyramid shaped head, there are also lots of bugs (scary stuff to a child), and burned childlike creatures who scream and cry out as they harass Rose in a well-done scene.The other world's transformation to this nightmare world is indicated by the sound of sirens.  Here's a hint figuring out why sirens are heard will help you movie critics figure out who's nightmare it is.  It will also help you analysis an important aspect of the film's storyline.So would I recommend this movie?  You bet.  It's one of the best video game adaptations out there.  I should know because I've seen more than my fair share of terrible movie adapations based on popular video games, the Resident Evil movies and Super Mario Brothers are some of the bad ones that immediately come to mind.

1001846,AVI158V7UOB2B,B000GCFO08,Sir Cinephiliac,"[1, 3]","I don't much like horror movies that make you think about the plot or lack thereof, because they distract me from what I like about these kinds of movies, the thrill of getting scared. Silent Hill strayed from its genre, and not in a very subtle way.The overall atmosphere of the film was excellent. CGI effects created an almost believable haunted town with great lurking beasties of all shapes and sizes. I enjoyed the massacre and burning scenes near the end, although, it was more disturbing than scary, and some of you more faint-hearted viewers might disapprove.The story starts here. We have our heroine, young and beautiful, which I'm always partial to. She's trying to free her adopted daughter from the nightmares she keeps having, nightmares of a place called 'Silent Hill'. She decides to confront this place with her daughter, and somehow dispel the source of the nightmares. Things don't go smoothly though. She's hounded by a nosy cop, and on top of that, a mysterious apparition causes her to crash her car near the entrance of the haunted town. When she awakes, everything is covered in ash, and her daughter is missing.And so the real nightmare begins... or does it? That's just one of the many nagging questions you ask yourself by the end of the movie. At what point do the mom and daughter really lose themselves to silent hill? Perhaps at the very beginning in the crash, or at the end during the massacre. Well, that's never clear, even by the end of the movie, and if you watch it, you'll know what I mean.Throughout at least half of the movie, mom runs around town on wild goose-chases searching for something or someone that resembles her daughter. In the interim, the landscape of Silent Hill changes from light to dark and back again. As you might guess, dark is not a good time to be roaming Silent Hill, cause that's when the beasties emerge from the shadows, and stalk our cute heroine. Well, this cycle repeats a couple of times throughout the movie, until we start to get a clearer picture of what's going on.As the story fleshes out, things become increasingly less discernable so that by the end of the film, the plot gets more holes in it than the evil fanatic cult leader (probably the most graphic scene in the movie).Well not all is lost. If you can disregard the parts that don't make sense, and simply enjoy the attention-grabbing gore, and thrilling effects, then it does prove to be a somewhat enjoyable film. But if you're a straight-up horror enthusiast, then I would recommend Dawn of the Dead, or Resident Evil for your viewing pleasure.",3,3 Stars for Depravity and CGI effects.,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,2584,"['do', ""n't"", 'much', 'horror', 'movies', 'make', 'think', 'plot', 'lack', 'thereof', 'distract', 'what', 'like', 'kinds', 'movies', 'thrill', 'getting', 'scared', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'strayed', 'genre', 'not', 'very', 'subtle', 'way.The', 'overall', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'effects', 'created', 'almost', 'believable', 'haunted', 'town', 'great', 'lurking', 'beasties', 'shapes', 'sizes', 'enjoyed', 'massacre', 'burning', 'scenes', 'end', 'was', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scary', 'more', 'faint-hearted', 'viewers', 'might', 'disapprove.The', 'story', 'starts', 'here', 'have', 'heroine', 'young', 'beautiful', ""'m"", 'always', 'partial', 'trying', 'free', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'nightmares', 'having', 'nightmares', 'place', 'called', ""'Silent"", 'Hill', 'confront', 'place', 'daughter', 'somehow', 'dispel', 'source', 'nightmares', 'Things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'smoothly', 'hounded', 'nosy', 'cop', 'top', 'mysterious', 'apparition', 'crash', 'car', 'entrance', 'haunted', 'town', 'When', 'everything', 'covered', 'ash', 'daughter', 'missing.And', 'so', 'real', 'nightmare', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'nagging', 'questions', 'ask', 'end', 'movie', 'what', 'point', 'do', 'mom', 'daughter', 'really', 'lose', 'silent', 'hill', 'Perhaps', 'very', 'beginning', 'crash', 'end', 'massacre', 'Well', 'never', 'clear', 'even', 'end', 'movie', 'watch', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean.Throughout', 'least', 'half', 'movie', 'mom', 'runs', 'town', 'wild', 'goose-chases', 'searching', 'something', 'someone', 'daughter', 'interim', 'landscape', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'changes', 'light', 'dark', 'back', 'again', 'might', 'guess', 'dark', 'not', 'good', 'time', 'be', 'roaming', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'cause', 'when', 'beasties', 'emerge', 'shadows', 'stalk', 'cute', 'heroine', 'Well', 'cycle', 'couple', 'times', 'movie', 'start', 'get', 'clearer', 'picture', 'what', 'going', 'story', 'out', 'things', 'become', 'increasingly', 'less', 'discernable', 'end', 'film', 'plot', 'more', 'holes', 'evil', 'fanatic', 'cult', 'leader', 'probably', 'most', 'graphic', 'scene', 'movie', 'not', 'lost', 'can', 'disregard', 'parts', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'attention-grabbing', 'gore', 'thrilling', 'effects', 'then', 'prove', 'be', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'film', ""'re"", 'straight-up', 'horror', 'enthusiast', 'then', 'would', 'recommend', 'Dawn', 'Dead', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'viewing', 'pleasure']",N/A

1001849,A20UHWR387EFAG,B000GCFO08,Smeddley,"[8, 15]","In horror movies, there are several different rating factors.  Sadly, the only one this rated highly in is the one you don't want to: the cheese factor.  Mediocre acting, boring and unrealistic special effects, some hard-to-hear (perhaps mercifully) dialogue and over-the-top 'mood music' are enough to render this movie nearly unwatchable.  Plus the overall darkness of most of the scenes (a trend in horror movies these days, I suspect to cut back on special effects budgets) means that even if you watch the movie in the dark you're still squinting at the screen.I found it sadly lacking in plot (okay, it had one, but not a good one - it was trite and recycled) and with almost no suspense to speak of.  I didn't care what happened to the characters.  At one point I was willing to off the main character myself if it'd just stop her shouting.  Of course, this could be because the sound swung wildly from barely audible to bursting your eardrums.  It had a few moments that might have made you jump, were I not overwhelmed with apathy (for instance, the scene with the nurse corpses would have been jumpy, except I spent the time thinking how much it would have improved the movie if they'd busted out into the Thriller song and dance).  It had no lasting, nightmare-giving spook effect (though I admit to being a hard-core horror movie veteran, it would take a lot).I was even willing to give it credit in that it lacked the gratuitous gore that movie-makers now think is a good substitute for real horror, but then the end of the movie was showers of blood and unnecessary gore, which added nothing and took away any brownie points it may have earned in that arena.The only redeeming factor in the entire movie was the very end.  I'll give it a little credit there for not taking the easy route and leaving you with a little lingering air of mystery.  But that wasn't enough to even come close to tipping the scales against the mountain of badness that had accumulated.

1001852,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,B000GCFO08,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[2, 3]","The first - but hopefully not the last - movie based on the groundbreaking series of video games, ""Silent Hill"" is an utterly riveting, horrific, eerie, and pyschologically and conceptually deep film, one that may take multiple watches to really 'get' all the facets within it, particularly if one isn't familiar with the games.An adopted little girl named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is plagued by violent night terrors and sleepwalking in which she seems to be frantically searching for something.  She's unaided by conventional medicine, and after one night's nightmare-driven excursions nearly prove fatal, the girl's mother Rose (Radha Mitchell from ""Pitch Black"" and ""Man On Fire"") decides to seek out what her daughter screams for in her sleep - 'Silent Hill!!' - and upon discovering that Silent Hill is the name of an old town, heads off with Sharon in search or relief for her daughter, in what form she doesn't even know.  Her husband (Sean Bean, of the criminally under-noticed ""The Dark"" as well as ""Lord Of The Rings"", ""Equilibrium"" and ""Flightplan"") fears this is just going to do more harm than good and takes off after them.Upon arriving in the abandoned town, Rose becomes separated from Sharon and with the help of a policewoman attempts to find her, and the true terror begins.  Silent Hill is a town like no other, of which multiple versions exist concurrently, and which sometimes shifts between them.  It's a place of nightmares and monsters - brought to life with amazingly disturbing imagery and visuals - and the ancestral home of a Very twisted, corrupted version of religion.  And many of its old secrets focus right on the little girl.To touch briefly on the psychological and conceptual depth of the movie, I'm going to have to give away more than I normally do, so I'll preface the rest of this with*WARNING: SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD**Okay, there's a lot here open to interpretation, so the way I see some of the things toward the end of the film isn't neceasrily how everybody else is going to see it (and a lot of it is just hinted at, hopefully for possible expansion should they do a sequel), but there seem to be an awful lot of strange and fascinating undercurrents here. Basically - it never states this outright, but this is my take - there are places on Earth where if enough human cruelty and hatred comes out, it can open the door for those things to draw 'entities' or states-of-existance to come into contact with our world.  But this is a really interesting part - the demon Pyramid Head, from a certain point of view, seems to have come to empathize with the innocent more than with the cruel, and to be acting as an avenger of certain victims in the town's history.  That's not to say Pyramid Head is a 'good guy' rather than the 'bad guy' of the game, but it raises questions.  Can a demon come to feel compassion?, for example.  This goes with the whole flow of the video games, which has brought in questions of basically 'what horrors can twist the good into the abominable?', and has also played with the flip side of the equation.If there is a sequel, I don't know whether this angle will be followed up on, or whether it'll be left stand as an 'even the most evil can have some occasional virtue in there' thing without taking Pyramid Head from his 'terrifying villain' role, but either way has its merits.  ""Silent Hill"" is chock-full of revenge, evil characters, blood-ripping/bone-crushing horror, and the most ghastly visual imagery, and it's also loaded up under the surface with themes of love, compassion, and justice.  There's a strong interplay between characters, as with the games - you're never playing just a character out to save their own skin in the video games, there's always something of a group dynamic where there's someone your character is out to protect, and simultaneously where your character needs to take a chance on trusting other, possibly duplicitous, characters as well.It all combines brilliantly, and in this case gives us one of the best movies of the year.

1001853,A29EEL0560NVG7,B000GCFO08,"Steve67 ""Steve500067""","[3, 5]","I have to say that Silent hill so far is the only game to film adaption that truly followed the feel, look, and even sound of the game it's based on. As we are to expect, the movie does'nt follow any story line from the games, although it is very similar to that of the first; in which our lead ""Rose"" whom replaces ""Harry"" of the first game, is in search of her missing daughter. As the movie progresses we see familiar characters, like Dhalia Gillespie and the nurse Lisa, whom has a small role in the film. We're also witness to various creatures we've encountered in the game, more notably Pyramid Head  and the Nurses.We also seeother memorable creatures, like the little ghosts and a freaky new one called ""the Janitor"". The film combines elements from all four games. Like the monsters from the second, and various little enviroment and characters details from the others. The movie keeps the games music which adds to the excellent atmosphere the film presents.I think the look and atmosphere are one of the strongest elements in the movie.They spared no expense in the blood and gore department, especially towards the end. Another aspect I thoroughly enjoyed was the transition between the real world and the dark. It's very reminiscent of the game, especially when we hear that dreadful siren, warning our character of what to come. I felt that the explanantion and ending itself seemed a bit rushed.Other than a couplefairly slow paced sequences, the first half was brilliantly plyed out, with a mix of moody atmosphere and freaky characters.Then as we reach our climax we seemingly get rushed explanation and ending, which did not really fit the feel of the first part of the movie. Regardless, I still enjoyed the film the film from start to finish. Overall fans of the game may be dissapointed by the thin story line, but in ways it makes it up.with excellent use of the games music, along with the right atmosphere and a fair amount of blood and gore. Look out for some of the more notable creatures in the movie, as they look very much like they do in the games.In the modern age of remakes amd games to film adaptation, Silent Hill sucessfully pulls off a creepy movie  that stays true to the games it's based on. If only it did'nt seem so rushed towards the end could have been better. Still though I say bring on part TWO!!

1001854,AZCDCO6KK2T81,B000GCFO08,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[9, 11]","I loved this stylish horror film that manages to both entertain and disturb.  If there is ever a way to capture a nightmare on film, then this film has found a way to do it.I think most of Amazon's review is dead on accurate except for the ending comment that the film feels hollow.  I don't get that, in fact, I was quite moved by the end of the story.I have always enjoyed horror films that focus more on atmosphere, plot and character development over gore, porn, and special effects; however, this film knocked me over with its gore and special effects that only enhance the plot elements of the film.  It's rare when a film can do that appropriately (such as in the originalNight of the Living Dead).  This film's washed out blue-filtered photography, generally disturbing images, outstanding make-up, and deliberate pacing make this a standout in this genre.  The film is both boldly original and oddly familiar in its nightmarish presentation.In addition, the film has great plot twists (which I won't spoil for you) and characters that we sincerely care about; hence, my disagreement with Amazon's comment that the film feels ""hollow.""  We are attached to the characters in this film because of the great performances of the very familiar faces.  Raha Mitchell ofPitch Blackis quickly becoming a very recognized actress even though her name often escapes most.  Sean Bean's presence is welcomed in this horror flick and lends it credibility.  He's a classy actor that we have come to feel comfortable with whether he's the heavy like inNational Treasureor the good guy inFlightplan.  Finally, the appearance of the great, but largely under appreciated actress, Alice Krige, who is probably best remembered forGhost Story,Sleepwalkers, and as the Borg Queen inStar Trek - First Contact.  She is not only still beautiful, but also still quite chilling in her portrayal of evil characters.This film is your worst nightmare come to life.  It's totally surreal, atmospheric, graphic, and frightening.

1001856,AK5X97CRMU17P,B000GCFO08,Sun Ce,"[1, 3]","First off, I have to admit that I never finished Silent Hill or Silent Hill 2 on the PS2 simply because it freaked me out too much.  I had decent hopes for the movie, no matter what the critics said.  Unfortunately, the critics were right.  The movie has its good and bad but sometimes the bad isn't so bad that the movie is ok.  This is different than going in w/ low expectations and being content with it.  This movie just doesn't do it for me.Scary and horror movies have many different ways of being effective.  Graphics can be scary, sure, but if they aren't backed up properly, it can be viewed as a joke or weird.  The concepts behind the horror has to be sound. If they can mess with your mind, even better.  Sometimes the action can be horrific.  Shock value doesn't go that far.Alien for example, was a good horror movie.  It wasn't necessarily the concept, but the atmosphere.Event Horizon had a creepy concept.  The concept of an evil, horrific force that can span across the galaxy had me creeped out more than the movie itself.Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw, etc.  It was all about the concepts.  Silent Hill doesn't do it conceptually or storywise.  Confusing, cryptic storylines work (Ju-On) but not in Silent Hill.  The basic story that Rose's daughter, Sharon, is a bit of a nutcase.  Rose believes that the only way to get her `fixed' is to visit the town of Silent Hill which Sharon tends to babble about in her sleep.  She also sleepwalks which really doesn't help matters much.  Sound enough premise, right?Nope.  By the time they get into a town that nobody wants to remember and strange things start happening, it SHOULD be time to pack up and go.  There wasn't really a sense of Rose being trapped (even though there were 2 scenes of the road being cut off) and all the viewer can think is, ""Just leave.  The kid's a psycho.""  I don't agree with the director and writers showing the monsters off so early in the game.  The suspense disappeared very quickly in that regard.Due to the rather lame story, it's hard to feel for these characters.  I have no problem with using a female cast; I think it's great.  The connection between mother and daughter are there but it's not strong enough for us to want the mother to really find the daughter.  Because of both the early showing of monsters and the story, the REST of the monsters that are shown aren't scary.  Triangle head, creeping roach dude and the nurses, it just doesn't work.  Even the funky motions of the creatures can't save it.  House on Haunted Hill was creepier, y'know?The rest of the story, the whole witch hunt thing, was really lame.  Come on...  Survival horror is far more interesting than a contrived Hollywood-like story.  Demons?  ACTUAL demons???  Evil taking the form of a little girl that looks like a female Ju-On???The effects were ok.  The motion of the monsters sucked (probably because we've seen it too much now), but I loved the fog and falling ash effects.  The changing of Silent Hill world to HELL world was very cool.  The siren was ultra creepy.  All I can say in the end is that this movie would have done just fine w/o the Silent Hill name.  Sure, it's remotely based off the 1st game but the suspense and action just don't last long enough.  A casual viewer might be remotely entertained but any real fan of the games won't like it.  As a movie, I'd give it a C-.  There are so many more things that could have been done with this property.

1001860,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,B000GCFO08,Terry Mesnard,"[4, 5]","I knew going into this film that Silent Hill would be deeply polarizing to different people.  There will be fans of the game that love it, fans of the game that hate it.  However, there will also be the casual audience member that will love it and the poor sap who will go ""WTF?  What am I watching?""Such is the huge task dropped into the laps of gamer Christophe Gans (the director) and Roger Avary (the writer).  Neither of which are slouches when it comes to making films.  Add to that a cast that includes Sean Bean and Rahda Mitchell, among others, and you have the makings of a video game movie worth watching.  So, is it?  Well, that depends on the kind of individual you are.The Silent Hill games are a very mysterious beast.  There is a semblance of a plot in the traditional sense holding them together.  However, much of the time is spent disecting the backstory of both the town and the people trapped therein.  The basic story of this movie is that Rose is a mother of a child named Sharon who is having dreams of Silent Hill.  Rose thinks its a good idea to take Sharon to Silent Hill to help her remember.  Fans of the horror genre know this can't turn well and it doesn't.  Rose crashes, Sharon vanishes and all hell breaks loose.The rest of the movie is stylishly shot with filters, fog and darkness to create a living nightmare, both literally and metaphorically.  Here is where Christophe Gans shines.  He is in full control of what the town should look like, how the camera angles should show the action and how to propel Rose toward the inevitable gory conclusion.  The biggest problem he had to face was to bring a story that is hidden behind notebooks, letters and cryptic dialogue to a 2 hour film that doesn't leave the audience not knowing what happened.  It's easier to piece together a cryptic plot in a 10 hour game or 500 page novel than it is in a 2 hour movie.I'll admit, there are some egregious dialogue problems.  But, I hate to say it, video games aren't exactly the birthing place of dialogue greatness.  Think Resident Evil: ""Blood.  I hope it's not...Chris's blood.""  Think Silent Hill 3: ""Remember me, and your true self as well, also that which you must become. The one who will lead us to Paradise with blood stained hands!"" It's a bit over the top.  So when lines are spouted in the movie that seem to be head-shakingly bad, I guess if we can't fault video games why fault a movie?As such, the film as a medium is forced to be a bit more obvious.  Here is where a lot of fans will turn up their noses.  I'll admit, there are times where the mystery is spoiled because Christophe wants the audience to understand more.  But overall, I think it works.  And works well if compared to other video game adaptations like Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Mario Brothers or *insert the Uwe Boll movie of the week here*.  Is it perfect?  No.  But what is here is an enjoyable representation of images, tone and feeling of the game series.",4,Love it or hate it?,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,2967,"['knew', 'going', 'film', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'would', 'be', 'deeply', 'polarizing', 'different', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'fans', 'game', 'love', 'fans', 'game', 'hate', 'However', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'casual', 'audience', 'member', 'will', 'love', 'poor', 'sap', 'who', 'will', 'go', 'WTF', 'What', 'am', 'watching', 'Such', 'huge', 'task', 'dropped', 'laps', 'gamer', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'director', 'Roger', 'Avary', 'writer', 'are', 'slouches', 'when', 'making', 'films', 'Add', 'cast', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Rahda', 'Mitchell', 'others', 'have', 'makings', 'video', 'game', 'movie', 'watching', 'So', 'Well', 'kind', 'individual', 'are.The', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'games', 'are', 'very', 'mysterious', 'beast', 'semblance', 'plot', 'traditional', 'sense', 'holding', 'together', 'However', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'disecting', 'backstory', 'town', 'people', 'trapped', 'therein', 'basic', 'story', 'movie', 'Rose', 'mother', 'child', 'named', 'Sharon', 'who', 'having', 'dreams', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'Rose', 'good', 'idea', 'take', 'Sharon', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'help', 'remember', 'Fans', 'horror', 'genre', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'turn', 'well', ""n't"", 'Rose', 'crashes', 'Sharon', 'vanishes', 'hell', 'loose.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'stylishly', 'shot', 'filters', 'fog', 'darkness', 'create', 'living', 'nightmare', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'Here', 'where', 'Christophe', 'Gans', 'shines', 'full', 'control', 'what', 'town', 'should', 'look', 'how', 'camera', 'should', 'show', 'action', 'how', 'propel', 'Rose', 'inevitable', 'gory', 'conclusion', 'biggest', 'problem', 'had', 'face', 'was', 'bring', 'story', 'hidden', 'notebooks', 'letters', 'cryptic', 'dialogue', '2', 'hour', 'film', ""n't"", 'leave', 'audience', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'easier', 'piece', 'together', 'cryptic', 'plot', '10', 'hour', 'game', '500', 'page', 'novel', '2', 'hour', 'movie.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'are', 'egregious', 'dialogue', 'problems', 'hate', 'say', 'video', 'games', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'birthing', 'place', 'dialogue', 'greatness', 'Think', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Blood', 'hope', 'not', 'Chris', 'blood', 'Think', 'Silent', 'Hill', '3', 'Remember', 'true', 'self', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'must', 'become', 'one', 'who', 'will', 'lead', 'Paradise', 'blood', 'stained', 'hands', 'bit', 'top', 'So', 'when', 'lines', 'are', 'spouted', 'movie', 'seem', 'be', 'head-shakingly', 'bad', 'guess', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'video', 'games', 'why', 'fault', 'movie', 'such', 'film', 'medium', 'forced', 'be', 'bit', 'more', 'obvious', 'Here', 'where', 'lot', 'fans', 'will', 'turn', 'up', 'noses', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'mystery', 'spoiled', 'Christophe', 'audience', 'understand', 'more', 'overall', 'think', 'well', 'compared', 'other', 'video', 'game', 'adaptations', 'Tomb', 'Raider', 'Resident', 'Evil', 'Mario', 'Brothers', '*insert', 'Uwe', 'Boll', 'movie', 'week', 'here*', 'perfect', 'No', 'what', 'here', 'enjoyable', 'representation', 'images', 'tone', 'feeling', 'game', 'series']",N/A

I went into the film expecting a dark, but potentially formulaic and predictable horror film like many others that studios have released lately.  What I saw was captivating and utterly disturbing...and I mean that as a sincere compliment to the filmmakers.The story line and exposition are a bit thin in spots, but once the viewer is immersed in the utterly nightmarish world of Silent Hill, the visual imagery is so compelling, the viewer is compelled to forgive these minor complaints.  I do not recall having seen a film before that so deeply resonated with my subconscious boogeymen.  Although the film certainly has its share of gory moments, the true horror is in the awful, hellish creatures that the protagonist experiences in the deserted town of Silent Hill.  From the misshapen, twisted humanoids to the miners to the ever-gruesome Red Pyramid, the creature work is fantastic.Another component of the film that makes it so utterly disturbing is that there is actually a town in my home state of Pennsylvania that has been largely abandoned for the same reasons as the fictional Silent Hill.  Centralia, PA is also on fire from beneath, and only a handful of residents remain.  Like Silent Hill, Centralia has been essentially decommissioned as a town (the post office even took away its zip code), and the knowledge that such a place actually exists (and that a few residents still live there) lends an air of authenticity to the film that only makes it that much more disturbing.This is not your average videogame-to-film adaptation (e.g., Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Doom) that relies more on the systematic execution of stylized violence between familiar characters than on any real filmmaking prowess.  Gans and his art directors create an alternate universe that is literally the stuff of nightmares.

I won't spoil what happens in the end, but I will say that I didn't care for it too much, it didn't seem like it offered enough closure, and it was a little confusing, but luckily this is not one of those cases where the ending makes or breaks the whole movie.

1001870,ADZIJQN6MNRAB,B000GCFO08,TRFB,"[2, 2]","I saw this movie on cable and I'm a big fan of the games.  The atmosphere was great, the story was a little disjoined.  It's one of those movies that you have to read into it in order to explain what's going on.  Couple of times I got confused.  But, didn't dwell on it too much so that I can continue the movie.  I liked Pyramid Head.  Wow, what he did to one of the people was right out of a Hellraiser film!!!  In fact, this movie did remind me a bit of Hellraiser, not as vulgar and sexually explicit, which I felt was the problems of the Hellraiser movies.  My wife left the room to tend to our daughter and didn't come back, so either the images disturbed her, or she wasn't that interested in the movie.  She's kinda funny when it comes to movies anyway.  She likes more of the killing, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, gangster type movies anyway.  Horror, just isn't her genre.  Me I like all kinds of movies.  As long as it doesn't have a whole lot of unnecessary sex, which this one doesn't, then I'll check it out.Silent Hill had many, many parts of the game thrown in, but done in a good way.  Very interestingly done.  As a fan of the game, this is a good movie.  If you're not, well, it maybe confusing.  The siren that goes off just before the world changes can be confusing to the non-gamer.  That was one of my questions.  Did the siren originate from the church?  Is it something that just happens before the darkness comes?What's even more interesting is that there is a place in Pennsylvania where there is a town that exists over underground fires that burn to this day.  Many of the people have fled and relocated, but others chose to remain.  Creepy huh?Going back to the movie, I would have to see it once again to fully understand the idea.  The ending is kinda sad.  Disappointing, but so are some of the endings of the games.  See it for yourself, BEFORE you buy.

1001872,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000GCFO08,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","OK, this review is written by a man who has not played the original Konami video games - actually any games for many years, so please read it as such. Not that I hate playing the games. I like it. I just don't have enough time for doing that now. But I liked director Christophe Ganz's previous film `Brotherhood of the Wolf' and the presence of Jodelle Ferland (`Tideland') is attractive enough.Jodelle Ferland plays a little girl Sharon DeSilva, who keeps dreaming about a ghost town named Silent Hill, a town that was completely burnt down 30 years ago. Sharon's protective mom Rose (Radha Mitchell, `Pitch Black'), in order to cure her daughter of the habit of bad daydreaming, takes her to the now deserted town, without telling her husband (Sean Bean) anything about her hasty decision. And soon it really turns out hasty because Rose is lost in Silent Hill after a car accident. Moreover, Rose finds her daughter is missing.The introduction is lengthy, but it is worth waiting. The spooky photography by Dan Laustsen (`Mimic') that captures the lost town of Silent Hill is fantastic with the perfect production designs of the ruined buildings and deserted streets while white ashes constantly falling from the sky add some surreal beauty to the scene. And when a siren wails over the town, lots of the undead, these creepy creatures (designed by Patrick Tatopoulos, `ID4') resurrect out of nowhere and start to attack Rose.[LOOK WHO WROTE THE SCRIPT] I mean no disrespect, but for all its terrific production designs, superb sound and visual effects, and very spooky and scary zombies, Christophe Ganz did one big mistake in making this film. It's the script that seems to observe all the rules of the original games, but ignore the basic rules of storytelling. You may remember the name of Roger Avery, once co-credited with Quentin Tarantino as writer of `Pulp Fiction.' It is Avery who is responsible for the messy story that makes no sense in the second half of the film.I confess that I don't understand the meaning of the ending except that it refuses to follow the conventional patterns of horror films. For all the inclusion of a missing little girl, the film in the middle part suddenly seems to forget all about her, concentrating its energy on the bloody battle against the undead. I admit these fierce battles are impressive, but Avery (who is responsible for Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames' torture scene in `Pulp Fiction') is so intent on surprising and annoying us with unnecessary sadistic themes like suggested child molesting. This film should be pure entertainment, and it is in some of the set-pieces, but even the fans of the games find it incoherent. Why didn't Christophe Ganz add the puzzle element to the story, which would be much helpful in drawing attention to the film's alternate world?The supporting cast including Sean Bean, Deborah Kara Unger, Laurie Holden, Kim Coates, and Alice Krige have virtually nothing to do except looking like minor characters in the video games. They all look great, but without them the film will do, so why not just drop them?Among many films adapted from the games, `Silent Hill' should be called a success. It is surprisingly emotional and is unique in that most of the main characters are played by women. Therefore, it is regrettable that the overwritten script does not live up to its wonderful cinematography.",3,"Terrific Cinematography, Very Disappointing Script",1152921600,"07 15, 2006",2006,3382,"['OK', 'review', 'written', 'man', 'who', 'not', 'played', 'original', 'Konami', 'video', 'games', 'actually', 'games', 'many', 'years', 'so', 'please', 'read', 'such', 'Not', 'hate', 'playing', 'games', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'doing', 'now', 'liked', 'director', 'Christophe', 'Ganz', 'previous', 'film', 'Brotherhood', 'Wolf', 'presence', 'Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'Tideland', 'attractive', 'enough.Jodelle', 'Ferland', 'little', 'girl', 'Sharon', 'DeSilva', 'who', 'dreaming', 'ghost', 'town', 'named', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'town', 'was', 'completely', 'burnt', 'down', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Sharon', 'protective', 'mom', 'Rose', 'Radha', 'Mitchell', 'Pitch', 'Black', 'order', 'cure', 'daughter', 'habit', 'bad', 'daydreaming', 'now', 'deserted', 'town', 'telling', 'husband', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'anything', 'hasty', 'decision', 'soon', 'really', 'out', 'hasty', 'Rose', 'lost', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'car', 'accident', 'Moreover', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'missing.The', 'introduction', 'lengthy', 'worth', 'waiting', 'spooky', 'photography', 'Dan', 'Laustsen', 'Mimic', 'lost', 'town', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'fantastic', 'perfect', 'production', 'designs', 'ruined', 'buildings', 'deserted', 'streets', 'white', 'ashes', 'constantly', 'falling', 'sky', 'add', 'surreal', 'beauty', 'scene', 'when', 'siren', 'town', 'lots', 'undead', 'creepy', 'creatures', 'designed', 'Patrick', 'Tatopoulos', 'ID4', 'resurrect', 'nowhere', 'start', 'attack', 'Rose', '[', 'LOOK', 'WHO', 'WROTE', 'THE', 'SCRIPT', ']', 'mean', 'disrespect', 'terrific', 'production', 'designs', 'superb', 'sound', 'visual', 'effects', 'very', 'spooky', 'scary', 'zombies', 'Christophe', 'Ganz', 'did', 'one', 'big', 'mistake', 'making', 'film', 'script', 'observe', 'rules', 'original', 'games', 'ignore', 'basic', 'rules', 'storytelling', 'may', 'remember', 'name', 'Roger', 'Avery', 'once', 'co-credited', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'writer', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Avery', 'who', 'responsible', 'messy', 'story', 'sense', 'second', 'half', 'film.I', 'confess', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'meaning', 'ending', 'follow', 'conventional', 'patterns', 'horror', 'films', 'inclusion', 'missing', 'little', 'girl', 'film', 'middle', 'part', 'suddenly', 'forget', 'concentrating', 'energy', 'bloody', 'battle', 'undead', 'admit', 'fierce', 'battles', 'are', 'impressive', 'Avery', 'who', 'responsible', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Ving', 'Rhames', 'torture', 'scene', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'so', 'intent', 'surprising', 'annoying', 'unnecessary', 'sadistic', 'themes', 'suggested', 'child', 'molesting', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'set-pieces', 'even', 'fans', 'games', 'find', 'incoherent', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Christophe', 'Ganz', 'add', 'puzzle', 'element', 'story', 'would', 'be', 'much', 'helpful', 'drawing', 'attention', 'film', 'alternate', 'world', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Sean', 'Bean', 'Deborah', 'Kara', 'Unger', 'Laurie', 'Holden', 'Kim', 'Coates', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'have', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'do', 'looking', 'minor', 'characters', 'video', 'games', 'look', 'great', 'film', 'will', 'do', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'just', 'drop', 'many', 'films', 'adapted', 'games', 'Silent', 'Hill', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'success', 'surprisingly', 'emotional', 'unique', 'most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'women', 'Therefore', 'regrettable', 'overwritten', 'script', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'wonderful', 'cinematography']",N/A

The doctors tell the couple that their daughter is going insane, but Rose will not accept that diagnosis.  She decides to take Sharon to the one place that she keeps mentioning in her sleep, Silent Hill.  Supposedly Silent Hill was abandoned years ago because of an ever-burning mine beneath the city, but Rose decides to take Sharon there anyway.  After getting in an accident with a woman police officer (Laurie Holden), Rose awakens to find that Rose has disappeared and wondered into Silent Hill.  The place is eerie and disturbing.  Rose searches high and low to find Sharon, but when the sun goes down she discovers that there are monsters everywhere.  In the times of light Rose and the police officer, Cybil, learn that the people still living in the city take refuge in the town church when the Darkness and monsters come.  As Rose learns, though, things aren't exactly black and white and that in Silent Hill your best bet is taking a path down a road of grey.SILENT HILL is slightly better than the average horror-suspense movie, with two elements in particular that allow it to stand out.  The first is the music.  SILENT HILL has some of the creepiest music I have ever heard in a film.  Listening to just a few strains early in the movie was enough to give me the willies.  The other element that stood out for me in the movie were the monsters.  The structure of the movie is set up so you know exactly when the creatures are going to come out:  sirens blare, crows fly, and the sky turns dark.  Despite those warnings, the monsters of Silent Hill are still horrifying enough to frighten just about anyone.  They move at a regular pace, but with almost unnatural movements that seem like some grotesque ritual.  I later learned that the reason for this is that dancers were mostly hired for those roles.Even though I found SILENT HILL to be a better than average horror-suspense movie, I didn't enjoy it all that much.  It suppose it worked the way it was intended to, because I was left with some disturbing feelings and images after seeing it; the movie truly frightened me.  However, there was just too much unnecessary gore and violence for my tastes, especially during the last twenty-minutes of the movie.SILENT HILL is a movie that fans of the horror genre will probably appreciate most.

Though it absolutely felt like a hell on earth kind of a movie with a satisfying ending scene, the main character, the dialogue, and the pacing really make this movie a chore to watch.Rose, the main character is absolutely terrible. She's annoying, not very well acted, and acts a little too crazy and desperate that it was on the verge of unbelievable. It didn't make sense for this woman to speed away from the cop Cybil, nor did it make sense why Cybil even pulled her over. Nothing that Cybil saw at the gas station should have raised any alarms.Cybil on the other hand was a great character, that was hampered by bad dialogue. She made sense and kicked ass when she needed to, but at the same time, uttered some of the silliest phrases that I just had to shake my head.The rest of the main supporting cast, you know, the men not in Silent Hill. Awful, boring, and the least interesting to watch on screen. It felt like the movie could have done without them and that the scenes were added in without much enthusiasm.However, the crazy church woman that is the leader of a little cult in Silent Hill. That chick was awesome and delivered her lines perfectly. You loved to hate her and man did she conjure up all the negative things you think of when faced with a religious zealot. Just a wonderful character to watch, well-acted, and overall well-thought out.Another great thing was the creature design. The creatures were disgusting, moved horribly, and would absolutely fuel your nightmares if you unlucky enough to watch this movie as a child. They were based off Silent Hill monsters of course, but seeing them come to life in the movie made them all the more frightening. Absolutely horrific stuff, really great.But at the same time, the over reliance on CG for certain elements made the film a little too &#34;clean&#34; for a horror movie. You never really feel scared when you're watching this movie. Everything feels very fake and glossy, when really the movie should have looked a little bit more grainy and amateur. You get this feeling that you're in a nicely made haunted house that has creepy and disgusting stuff, but nothing that will really scare you.Which also brings up the editing. The movie was really slow and boring at times and I shudder to think what the uncut version of this movie would have looked like. There's just too many moments where there's pointless running screaming &#34;Sharon&#34; and then cut back to what the male character is doing. Unfortunately, the male character doesn't offer or add anything to the movie, at all.However, the climactic scene in the movie is absolutely spectacular and horrifying to watch. The creature they created for this film was just perfectly created and executed. The way the resolution for this film hits is ultra satisfying and absolutely does not disappoint.I didn't care much for the ending, but considering how great it was to see justice served, it more than made up for the lackluster ending.Overall, give the movie a watch if it's free. Could it be worth a rental? Mmm... hard to say. If you like to see disgusting creature designs and evil people get their just desserts, then yeah, sure give it a rental But if you can't stand bad acting, bad writing, and sometimes questionable pacing.

The big, puffy flakes would scatter any light back into my little pool of night, and would absorb all the sound in the world. Everything else would be far, far away, deadened by distance behind my gentle wall of snow.This whole movie makes a nightmare of that childhood dream. Instead of cloud-distilled water, this snow is burning poison. Even while it hides the evil outside, the snow itself erodes eyes, lungs and skin. But it's the evil that counts.After a moment's thought, it's easy to see that this is a game adaptation, like Tomb Raider or Super Mario Brothers. There's no plot to speak of, in the sense that one scene has to come before or after another. Instead, it's dozens of scenes and vignettes, flying in close formation. What matters instead is the mood, the visuals, and the characters. Rose (Radha Mitchell) stands out, as a very womanly character, and very strong because of it. In fact, all of the female characters are good. According to the IMDB blurb, that makes sense - male characters were an afterthought, and it shows.I've never played the SH game, and am not likely to. I've read part of the comic series, though, and loved it. It's nothing like the movie, except in all the ways that count - in those, it's great.Different viewers will rate this movie differently.

1001887,A1JMYZA3MR27WC,B000GCFO08,"Wux Iapan ""Fantas""","[1, 1]","I confess, I played the game, actually all SHs. Parts 1 to 3 took place in the town of silent hill. The movie is a bit of a mess/mix from the first and second entry. In the first SH, part of the big thrill was not to know anything. The game began with a really confusing introduction, actual events and such that will happen during the game: actual events involving a couple finding a baby (think Moses), a skinburnt girl in pain, a cop getting a call, a man with his daughter in a car, meeting up with the cop from before, then they have an accident...SPOILERS AHEAD:the game began right after the guy awakens in the broken car, realizing the daughter's gone. From then on, the quest for finding her became secondary when he finds that the accident brought him to a deserted town, with snow falling in the middle of summer, raising questions like ""what's this place? Where's everyone?"". During about half of the game there was this eerie feeling only due to lack of knowing what's going on. That doesn't mean the player was just doing one puzzle/fight after the other, the story evolved around the idea, that the guy might have been killed during the accident as the town has two faces: one being in thick fog, the other in darkness. Just as in the movie, the darkness transformed the environment and brought up different kind of enemies. The cinematic aspect of it was the brilliantly told story and the feeling of total isolation it caused as the few people who meet are just as confused as the main character. Slowly, there was story being built around the situation: that of a town in which the police once was looking for drug dealings, that of tourists once buying them, that of a hospital with a secret strange place in the cellar, that of a doctor drifting around town with a strange bag, that of children books with monsters you actually met (=fears becoming reality), that of the abusing of a girl by her own mother... slowly we got the picture and the idea that the own daughter might play a specific role in all this.In SH2 it was obvious that the town of silent hill was a ghost town that existed for real. It was left alone and deserted as many american ghost towns. From there the main character gets a letter from his dead wife, inviting him to the place they once loved. So he's not caught in another dimension, he was walking throught a real life town, but as in part one, it changed its face every now and then.The movie is mixing up both ideas: that of a person searching for her daughter in a strange town and that of a person actually looking for a really existing ghost town named silent hill (in the games you were always asking yourself if this place exists or not). I didn't like this fusion that much as it takes away the individual basic feeling of both games. It's a bit hard to explain unless you've experienced the games.The monsters are a bit too digital, the pyramid head and the nurses (!) looked like from a music video clip to me and were placed in a ridicoulus situation, like a table dancing group they stand there. I had to giggle there.Not my movie, but I liked the atmosphere and the pictures. The way Gans is trying to explain it all is ways ways ways overdone.

It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying ""that was a stupid movie"". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways.",4,good accurate film,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,1199,"['First', 'off', 'downsides', 'parts', 'movie', 'seemed', 'little', 'drawn', 'film', 'was', 'two', 'hours', 'certain', 'times', 'could', 'feel', 'far-fetched', 'can', 'imagine', 'people', 'rolling', 'eyes', 'storyline', 'WILL', 'be', 'people', 'walking', 'out', 'saying', 'was', 'stupid', 'movie', 'many', 'people', 'responded', 'Final', 'Fantasy', 'Spirits', 'Within', 'course', 'will', 'be', 'saying', 'response', 'sheer', 'amount', 'gore', 'violence', ""'upsides"", 'movie', 'certainly', 'had', 'moments', 'shock', 'anticipation', 'gore', 'especially', 'climax', 'Scenes', 'even', 'alleyways', 'monsters', 'games', 'were', 'almost', 'identical', ""'ve"", 'played', 'games', 'will', 'get', 'lot', 'deja', 'vu', 'example', 'camera', 'crooked', 'exactly', 'same', 'time', 'place', 'one', 'scenes', 'game', 'Also', 'lot', 'sounds', 'music', 'tracks', 'games', 'are', 'used', 'so', 'are', 'monsters', 'entire', 'feel', 'games', 'preserved', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'trouble', 'keeping', 'feet', 'floor', 'entire', 'movie', 'creepy', 'presentation', 'works', 'have', ""n't"", 'played', 'games', 'movie', 'will', 'scare', 'new', 'ways']",N/A

The acting was pretty good, effects were awesome, the plot was strong and I liked the ending. I was a little scared but I found the movie more creepy than scary. It's certainly better than a lot of horror/thriller stuff that has come out lately. It contained some fairly grusome stuff but was surprisingly low on actual blood and gore, I think it could have used more in this area. Also, I persoanlly think the whole 'gates of hell' concept is overdone in movies but I never played the game so maybe I am missing something here. The ambiance of the movie overall was wonderfully dark and it was well paced with good action. I did like it and I would watch it again and would suggest it to anyone who likes a good scary movie.",3,Not bad....,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,781,"['would', 'say', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'disliked', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'effects', 'were', 'awesome', 'plot', 'was', 'strong', 'liked', 'ending', 'was', 'little', 'scared', 'found', 'movie', 'more', 'creepy', 'scary', 'certainly', 'better', 'lot', 'horror/thriller', 'stuff', 'come', 'out', 'lately', 'contained', 'fairly', 'grusome', 'stuff', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'low', 'actual', 'blood', 'gore', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'area', 'Also', 'persoanlly', 'think', 'whole', ""'gates"", 'hell', 'concept', 'overdone', 'movies', 'never', 'played', 'game', 'maybe', 'am', 'missing', 'something', 'here', 'ambiance', 'movie', 'overall', 'was', 'wonderfully', 'dark', 'was', 'well', 'paced', 'good', 'action', 'did', 'like', 'would', 'watch', 'again', 'would', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'scary', 'movie']",N/A

I didn't even know it was based on a video game.  I thought the cinematography was fantastic, and the score was mesmorizing and haunting.  The whole film plays out like a mystical dream or a bad nightmare, that all depends upon your style.  The special effects are fantastic, it puts you in that demon world.  Radha Mitchell is one of those obscure actresses. She also plays in ""High Art"", which is another fantastic film.
