This Volume injects a new story line into the plot and tying it in with the previous story nicely.  The beginning was a little jarring because in the introduction of the new story with the new characters it goes a while before we see characters that we're familiar with, I almost felt like they were abandoning them all together!  Anyway, overall a great volume.  I highly enjoyed it and can't wait to see Volume 7!!",4,Great infusion of new story into Red vs. Blue!,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,513,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Volumes', '1-5', 'felt', 'same', 'stories', 'were', 'being', 'done', 'over', 'Volume', 'new', 'story', 'line', 'plot', 'tying', 'previous', 'story', 'nicely', 'beginning', 'was', 'little', 'jarring', 'introduction', 'new', 'story', 'new', 'characters', 'while', 'see', 'characters', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'almost', 'felt', 'were', 'abandoning', 'together', 'Anyway', 'overall', 'great', 'volume', 'highly', 'enjoyed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'Volume', '7']",N/A

To see how the crew at Rooster Teeth took their first season and evolved their story to this point is awesome.  Their jokes get bigger, better, and their characters back stories just keep you wondering what the heck that next season is going to focus on.  They never disappoint.  Even if you aren't a Halo player (which I'm not) the writing is excellent and there is something for everyone in the world of RvB - are you a Griff, a Sarge, maybe a Caboose?  Maybe we're all a little bit of each of them.  :)",5,Loving that RvB!,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,809,"['guys', 'are', 'probably', 'sick', 'praising', 'RvB', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'what', 'got', 'ta', 'do', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'biggest', 'fans', 'Project', 'Freelancer', 'story', ""'ve"", 'been', 'fan', 'longest', 'running', 'web', 'series', 'then', 'really', 'need', 'check', 'out', 'story', 'better', 'better', 'see', 'how', 'crew', 'Rooster', 'Teeth', 'took', 'first', 'season', 'evolved', 'story', 'point', 'awesome', 'jokes', 'get', 'bigger', 'better', 'characters', 'back', 'stories', 'just', 'keep', 'wondering', 'what', 'heck', 'next', 'season', 'going', 'focus', 'never', 'disappoint', 'Even', 'are', ""n't"", 'Halo', 'player', ""'m"", 'not', 'writing', 'excellent', 'something', 'everyone', 'world', 'RvB', 'are', 'Griff', 'Sarge', 'maybe', 'Caboose', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'little', 'bit']",N/A

1217290,A8F6AEB388845,B001MNXN8A,M. Cooper,"[0, 0]",I love reconstruction. It really turns the show around. The heavy stuff with Church is really cool and interesting. But Caboose carries this season. I love it when Agent Washington first meets Caboose. The Sargent saying that they didn't have to pay him for Caboose is priceless. And when Agent Washington and Caboose meet Church is so funny. This season has so much new information it is awesome. But it is still so funny that it is my favorite of seasons 6-8.,5,This is my favorite of this part of the series.,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",2013,461,"['love', 'reconstruction', 'really', 'show', 'around', 'heavy', 'stuff', 'Church', 'really', 'cool', 'interesting', 'Caboose', 'season', 'love', 'when', 'Agent', 'Washington', 'first', 'Caboose', 'Sargent', 'saying', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'pay', 'Caboose', 'priceless', 'when', 'Agent', 'Washington', 'Caboose', 'meet', 'Church', 'so', 'funny', 'season', 'so', 'much', 'new', 'information', 'awesome', 'still', 'so', 'funny', 'favorite', 'seasons', '6-8']",N/A

1217292,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B001MNXN8A,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[0, 2]","Red VS. Blue The Blood Gultch Chronicles was a huge leap forward in animation and entertainment. A great story with memorable characters throw together just by using an ordinary video game with inginuity. After a success full 100 episode run anyone that was a fan would be curious to know where the next step would take us. Well it took us to the next part of the story, Red VS. Blue Reconstruction.Now I loved the first RVB and I was glad to see that the creators used the same cast of characters and stayed very loyal to the origonal story plot points. There was just a few things that just left me upset with this 20 epsiode spin off. First off the transition from a plain old goofy story line to a more serious mystery story line that leads to something way off from where the show was origionally going. I am always a fan of origionallity and a good story, but I feel that changing the mood and flow of the story really needs to have some kind of a transitional period. I will admit that the first few episodes of Reconstruction were very funny, but this story and the whole care of Project Freelance and Agent Washington was just a bit too dark too soon. Another thing I was upset about was the elimination of two major characters, Donut and Tucker. Tucker happens to be my favorite RVB cahracter so I am a bit guilty showing bias. Still, there really wasn't much of a story as to why these characters were missing from this project. Even when one may have been mentioned they sort of just dropped the subject and moved on. There was however a great story line involving Tex and how she was linked to characters like Wyoming and I was very shocked with the whole origin story of Church. On that possitive note I do like that fact that Sarge and his goofball lackies were there for a good chuckle here and there and Caboose is always appreciated to the good news is Reconstruction is not a total loss.Now there is a third series airing as we speak called Red VS. Blue: Recreation. So far what I have seen is good, because they went back to the origional theme of the story as well as throwing a few more surprises our way. So the final verdict on Reconstrution...you have to see the first installment of RVB and you have to see this installment otherwise you are sure to be lost in the machenima madness.",3,"RVB is always good, but lessons can be learned.",1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,2309,"['Red', 'VS.', 'Blue', 'Blood', 'Gultch', 'Chronicles', 'was', 'huge', 'leap', 'forward', 'animation', 'entertainment', 'great', 'story', 'memorable', 'characters', 'throw', 'together', 'just', 'using', 'ordinary', 'video', 'game', 'inginuity', 'success', 'full', '100', 'episode', 'run', 'anyone', 'was', 'fan', 'would', 'be', 'curious', 'know', 'where', 'next', 'step', 'would', 'take', 'Well', 'took', 'next', 'part', 'story', 'Red', 'VS.', 'Blue', 'Reconstruction.Now', 'loved', 'first', 'RVB', 'was', 'glad', 'see', 'creators', 'used', 'same', 'cast', 'characters', 'stayed', 'very', 'loyal', 'origonal', 'story', 'plot', 'points', 'was', 'just', 'few', 'things', 'just', 'left', 'upset', '20', 'epsiode', 'spin', 'off', 'First', 'transition', 'plain', 'old', 'goofy', 'story', 'line', 'more', 'serious', 'mystery', 'story', 'line', 'something', 'way', 'where', 'show', 'was', 'origionally', 'going', 'am', 'always', 'fan', 'origionallity', 'good', 'story', 'feel', 'changing', 'mood', 'flow', 'story', 'really', 'have', 'kind', 'transitional', 'period', 'will', 'admit', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'Reconstruction', 'were', 'very', 'funny', 'story', 'whole', 'care', 'Project', 'Freelance', 'Agent', 'Washington', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'dark', 'too', 'soon', 'thing', 'was', 'upset', 'was', 'elimination', 'two', 'major', 'characters', 'Donut', 'Tucker', 'Tucker', 'be', 'favorite', 'RVB', 'cahracter', 'so', 'am', 'bit', 'guilty', 'showing', 'bias', 'Still', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'why', 'characters', 'were', 'missing', 'project', 'Even', 'when', 'one', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'mentioned', 'sort', 'just', 'dropped', 'subject', 'moved', 'was', 'however', 'great', 'story', 'line', 'involving', 'Tex', 'how', 'was', 'linked', 'characters', 'Wyoming', 'was', 'very', 'shocked', 'whole', 'origin', 'story', 'Church', 'possitive', 'note', 'do', 'fact', 'Sarge', 'goofball', 'lackies', 'were', 'there', 'good', 'chuckle', 'here', 'there', 'Caboose', 'always', 'appreciated', 'good', 'news', 'Reconstruction', 'not', 'total', 'loss.Now', 'third', 'series', 'airing', 'speak', 'called', 'Red', 'VS.', 'Blue', 'Recreation', 'So', 'far', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'good', 'went', 'back', 'origional', 'theme', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'throwing', 'few', 'more', 'surprises', 'way', 'final', 'verdict', 'Reconstrution', 'have', 'see', 'first', 'installment', 'RVB', 'have', 'see', 'installment', 'otherwise', 'are', 'sure', 'be', 'lost', 'machenima', 'madness']",N/A
