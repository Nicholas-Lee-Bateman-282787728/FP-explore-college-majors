1618623,A20IIR0422G3A5,B00AZFECHW,"B. Marold ""Bruce W. Marold""","[11, 13]","The first thing you need to know is that this production was performed using the ""B"" script, published in 1616, which is over 600 lines longer than the ""A"" script, published in 1604. That means this is a very large cast, with scenes spread throughout history. The magical aspect of the production is that all of this is done within the confines of the stage of the reconstructed Globe theater, the theater of Shakespeare.Since the cast is so big, many actors play two or three roles, which is no problem, because so many roles are just on stage for a minute or so, like the seven vices. At the time of Christopher Marlowe's untimely death, he was probably more popular than Shakespeare, who had only a half dozen plays on the boards by that time. And Shakespeare was a great admirer of Marlowe. ""Doctor Faustus"" was probably the ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Cleopatra"" of the day. It's delightful to see how such a sprawling story can be told, with only pure stagecraft. Among Marlowe's plays, there are probably more notable quotes than from any other, rivaling several of Shakespeare's more quotable plays. The most famous is probably:Was this the face that launched a thousand ships,And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss:Her lips sucks forth my soul, see where it flies!The weight of the production lies primarily on the two lead characters, Faustus and Mephistopheles, Paul Hilton and Arthur Darvill. Neither have especially strong resumes, but a check on their work confirms my sense that Darvill is the more experienced and stronger of the two. I would also give a favorable mention to a number of the supporting cast, especially to the actor who plays Faust's servant, Wagner.I would also recommend it for the clarity of the actors' speeches. So many Shakespearean speeches seem to be delivered at double time, so it is hard to understand them. This play appears to be done close to a normal conversational speed.",5,Wonderful representation of sprawling play at the Globe,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",2013,1947,"['first', 'thing', 'need', 'know', 'production', 'was', 'performed', 'using', 'B', 'script', 'published', '1616', '600', 'lines', 'longer', 'A', 'script', 'published', '1604', 'very', 'large', 'cast', 'scenes', 'spread', 'history', 'magical', 'aspect', 'production', 'done', 'confines', 'stage', 'reconstructed', 'Globe', 'theater', 'theater', 'Shakespeare.Since', 'cast', 'so', 'big', 'many', 'actors', 'play', 'two', 'three', 'roles', 'problem', 'so', 'many', 'roles', 'are', 'just', 'stage', 'minute', 'so', 'seven', 'vices', 'time', 'Christopher', 'Marlowe', 'untimely', 'death', 'was', 'probably', 'more', 'popular', 'Shakespeare', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'half', 'dozen', 'plays', 'boards', 'time', 'Shakespeare', 'was', 'great', 'admirer', 'Marlowe', 'Doctor', 'Faustus', 'was', 'probably', 'Ben-Hur', 'Cleopatra', 'day', 'delightful', 'see', 'how', 'such', 'sprawling', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'told', 'only', 'pure', 'stagecraft', 'Marlowe', 'plays', 'are', 'probably', 'more', 'notable', 'quotes', 'other', 'rivaling', 'several', 'Shakespeare', 'more', 'quotable', 'plays', 'most', 'famous', 'probably', 'Was', 'face', 'launched', 'thousand', 'ships', 'burnt', 'topless', 'towers', 'Ilium', 'Sweet', 'Helen', 'make', 'immortal', 'kiss', 'lips', 'sucks', 'forth', 'soul', 'see', 'where', 'weight', 'production', 'primarily', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'Faustus', 'Mephistopheles', 'Paul', 'Hilton', 'Arthur', 'Darvill', 'have', 'especially', 'strong', 'resumes', 'check', 'work', 'confirms', 'sense', 'Darvill', 'more', 'experienced', 'stronger', 'two', 'would', 'also', 'give', 'favorable', 'mention', 'number', 'supporting', 'cast', 'especially', 'actor', 'who', 'Faust', 'servant', 'Wagner.I', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'clarity', 'actors', 'speeches', 'So', 'many', 'Shakespearean', 'speeches', 'seem', 'be', 'delivered', 'double', 'time', 'hard', 'understand', 'play', 'be', 'done', 'close', 'normal', 'conversational', 'speed']",Doctor Faustus

1618626,A2ZZHMT58ZMVCZ,B00AZFECHW,"L. Power ""nlp trainer""","[3, 4]","I have to admit that I am not always a fan of watching stage plays recorded on film, much preferring to see the movie like setting varying between real locations, although neither I think is a match for actually being there to watch a stage performance.In the 1960s  Marlowe's  Doctor Faustus was made into a movie starring Richard Burton as Faustus, and Elizabeth Taylor makes a brief appearance as Helen of Troy.While that movie had its good points, and its star power, I particularly loved the note of pathos in Mephistopheles voice, showing that this was a nuanced portrayal as opposed to a stock character.What becomes apparent as you begin to watch The Globe's production of that classic by Christopher Marlowe is that this though is a staged play it captures every nuance I think of what Marlowe intended, and perhaps a few he did not, and I mean that in a good way because it's all good.  In fact, if you ever wanted to see Faustus, I would highly recommend you get this version over any other.I particularly liked the comedic scenes, where one of the lesser character was accidentally using the magic book to make incantations, and what happens.  Then there is the beautiful and elegant expression of Marlowe.  There is the atmosphere created by the actors, and the response of the crowd particularly gives the play added dimension over staged plays which are filmed without audience participation.One also understands that the play is being performed in the medium in which it was originally written, so it would not be that difficult to go backwards in time and imagine what it would be like to be in an Elizabethan or Edwardian audience, probably loud sweaty and uncivilized,a raucous crowd that react to scenes where Faustus performs magic on the Pope.When one thinks about this particular era. although one tends to think of the Shakespeare plays as emblems of excellence, there were many great writers in that era who did create great works but who have been largely overlooked, and none were greater than Marlowe whose lines echo within the Shakespeare canon.&#34;Mingled with coral and with orient pearl.&#34;  Tamburlaine&#34;I'll have them fly to India for gold,Ransack the ocean for orient pearl &#34;  Doctor Faustus&#34;Of Persian silks, of gold, and orient pearl.&#34;  Jew of Malta&#34;This orient pearl.

1618628,A3RKS9KC04UXJP,B00AZFECHW,Steven R. Severance,"[0, 3]",This is a video of a live performance staged in a reproduction of the globe theatre. It is Marlow's Faustus not the more famous version by Goethe. The lead actor yells too much and stumbles over some lines. The play is hard to get into but eventually I got swept in. There are two extant versions of this play a short text and a long text with more slapstick stuck in . This production seems to be picking and choosing between both versions. It seems odd to go for a scholarly presentation but not a scholarly version of the text.As far as the play I much prefer Tamerlaine and the Jew of Malta by this author. Marlowe is really great at chalenging the status quo and making one wrestle with ideas. This play does not offer much opportunity for that. In this play Fausts also gets far too many chances to repent. That makes it boring and unrealistic.,3,Globe theatre presentation of Marlow's Faustus,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,850,"['video', 'live', 'performance', 'staged', 'reproduction', 'globe', 'theatre', 'Marlow', 'Faustus', 'not', 'more', 'famous', 'version', 'Goethe', 'lead', 'actor', 'yells', 'too', 'much', 'over', 'lines', 'play', 'hard', 'get', 'eventually', 'got', 'swept', 'are', 'two', 'extant', 'versions', 'play', 'short', 'text', 'long', 'text', 'more', 'slapstick', 'stuck', 'production', 'be', 'picking', 'choosing', 'versions', 'odd', 'go', 'scholarly', 'presentation', 'not', 'scholarly', 'version', 'text.As', 'far', 'play', 'much', 'prefer', 'Tamerlaine', 'Jew', 'Malta', 'author', 'Marlowe', 'really', 'great', 'chalenging', 'status', 'quo', 'making', 'one', 'wrestle', 'ideas', 'play', 'not', 'offer', 'much', 'opportunity', 'play', 'also', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'chances', 'repent', 'boring', 'unrealistic']",Doctor Faustus
