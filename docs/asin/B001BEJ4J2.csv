Maybe I am not deep enough but I never cared about the characters and what happened to them.  They could live or die, he could get the girl or not, I didn't even care what was in the box.  It's supposed to be a slightly mistical journey, but I wasn't rooting for anyone to get there.I enjoyed the sets, made me wish I had lived in a train car, still time for that I guess.

They finally get their big break, encounter some romance, and begin to see their true purpose in life.Eric Roberts is great as Mack Drake, a hardened LA club-owner, and Elodie Bouchez plays his wife who gets a little too close to one of the Nicks.If you're looking for an entertaining independent film, with a lot of great star power and an awesome soundtrack, ""The Beatnicks"" is definitely for you.",5,"Norman Reedus shines in ""The Beatnicks""",1268179200,"03 10, 2010",2010,882,"['underground', 'fanbase', 'thousands', 'people', 'star', 'power', 'people', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Jr.', 'Elodie', 'Bouchez', 'Eric', 'Roberts', 'Beatnicks', 'one', 'movies', 'cult', 'hit', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies', 'when', 'heard', 'Reedus', 'was', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'same', 'time', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'it.It', 'really', 'cool', 'film', 'laid-back', 'feel', 'two', 'guys', 'named', 'Nick', 'trying', 'make', 'LA', 'finally', 'get', 'big', 'break', 'romance', 'begin', 'see', 'true', 'purpose', 'life.Eric', 'Roberts', 'great', 'Mack', 'Drake', 'hardened', 'LA', 'club-owner', 'Elodie', 'Bouchez', 'wife', 'who', 'little', 'too', 'close', 'one', 'Nicks.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertaining', 'independent', 'film', 'lot', 'great', 'star', 'power', 'awesome', 'soundtrack', 'Beatnicks', 'definitely']",Beatnicks

It had good performances from Norman Reedus and Mark Boone Junior as the two Nicks but in all it really felt like the movie was just lacking something. The ending really wasn't an ending in my opinion.

1171654,ATAQMC7JWNLIX,B001BEJ4J2,Zaire M.,"[4, 4]","The Beatnicks is one of the strangest and most unique indie flicks I've seen in a long time. Its dreamlike sequences and quirky characters definitely makes it a must-see for anyone who's into great independent comedies.The film stars both Norman Reedus and Mark Boone Jr. as Nick Nero and Nick Beat, respectively. Both are struggling artists looking to hit it big, and risk becoming homeless in the process. Down on their luck and struggling to find that one special gig, they find a hidden treasure buried by a strange little monkey.This treasure chest of infinite beats gives them the chance to turn their life around, but Nero could lose it all when he becomes entangled with Nica (&Eacute;lodieBouchez), the fianc&eacute; of mafioso nightclub owner Mack Drake (Eric Roberts).One gig at the Monkey Club can decide their fate and the true origin of the treasure chest.Both Reedus and Boone Jr. deliver phenomenal performances early in their career, considering the movie was made in 2000. Check it out. It's well worth it.",5,A unique independent comedy that you'll be sure to love,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,1024,"['Beatnicks', 'one', 'strangest', 'most', 'unique', 'indie', 'flicks', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'dreamlike', 'sequences', 'quirky', 'characters', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'anyone', 'who', 'great', 'independent', 'comedies.The', 'film', 'stars', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'Mark', 'Boone', 'Jr.', 'Nick', 'Nero', 'Nick', 'Beat', 'respectively', 'are', 'struggling', 'artists', 'looking', 'hit', 'big', 'risk', 'becoming', 'homeless', 'process', 'luck', 'struggling', 'find', 'one', 'special', 'gig', 'find', 'hidden', 'treasure', 'buried', 'strange', 'little', 'monkey.This', 'treasure', 'chest', 'infinite', 'beats', 'chance', 'turn', 'life', 'Nero', 'could', 'lose', 'when', 'entangled', 'Nica', 'Eacute', 'lodieBouchez', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'mafioso', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'Mack', 'Drake', 'Eric', 'Roberts', '.One', 'gig', 'Monkey', 'Club', 'can', 'decide', 'fate', 'true', 'origin', 'treasure', 'chest.Both', 'Reedus', 'Boone', 'Jr.', 'deliver', 'phenomenal', 'performances', 'early', 'career', 'considering', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '2000', 'Check', 'out', 'well', 'worth']",Beatnicks
