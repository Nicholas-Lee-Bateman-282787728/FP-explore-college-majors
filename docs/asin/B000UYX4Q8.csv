Lees,"[4, 6]","First of all let me say that I love the idea: a man who has survived from 14,000 years ago tells his story for the first time to the academic colleagues he's about to leave.Each character represents a particular perspective: skeptic, religious type, lover, psychiatrist. It's a nice set-up and enables a wide-ranging discussion about history and humanities.Problem is, any human who survived that long wouldn't behave as the lead character behaves. Our brains are pattern-recognition machines and over time such a long-lived human would see all the clockwork of our hardwired behaviors.

Keep in mind this is no ordinary group..they are all professors, teachers and theologians at the top of their field...so the dialog among them is very intellectual and thought provoking among the small group. They have been friends for years and once they begin the conversation and discuss the possibility of John's revelations as a possibility not only does the intellect rise to a very profound level, it is mixed with the different emotions. In some cases, the emotions,questions, denials do get in the way but once again no matter how intelligent they are after all just people. And once the door is open it is really something to watch and listen to their answers and rebuttals, or attempts to knock John off his &#34;GAME&#34; as he puts forth hypothetical questions that develops throughout the night. Once they all realize that John is no longer speaking in the hypothetical, different emotions arise among the group of  friends; There is anger, resentment, wonder, acceptance and even fear for every revelation that John puts forth. Tony Todd is wonderful as in his own way comes to accept his friends &#34;TRUTH&#34; as a very real possibility and even makes very valid suppositions about the time line John gives them. William Katz is great as he immediately resents Johns story/theory and is determined to prove John might be nothing more than a psychotic have serious delusions. He calls in a Psychologist to help evaluate and even commit him if necessary. Why is he so angry, what is it he fears? That much is never made clear. However as the night progresses, others in group find reasons to resent John and his walk through history. And if you are religious this might not be the movie for you and would certainly give you pause as everything they thought they knew about history takes on deeper meanings. It is a very thought provoking movie that will give rise to many questions, particularly &#34;what if....&#34;  I gave it four stars because while I believed it was a very good movie with a plausible if not possible plot, more could have been explained about each member of the group and the different emotions that rage through them.

This was a really big SLEEPER film.  That is, it's much more than you would expect, even after you've watched it for several minutes and are not sure if you will continue to watch it, for it offers no conventional lures like typical moviegoers anticipate these days.  Instead, it offers cerebral stimulation of a rarefied pedigree.  The creator, Jerome Bixby, has been toying with concepts of alter dimensions and the concept of time during his career as a writer for Twilight Zone and the original Star Trek series, as well as in his own fiction novels.  This work is the culmination of a theme which he was developing for many years in the back of his mind, and his story is enticing and extremely entertaining and stimulating. What is probably the most amazing achievement to me is the utter simplicity of the set and the cast of characters, and the resultant impact the film can generate to the attentive viewer.  It does require an open mind, a bit of the 'suspension of disbelief' in the viewer not dissimilar to that shown by the characters themselves, to fully appreciate.  It also works best if the viewer does not ALWAYS require what is typically offered up in films today....excessive visual and audio stimulation with dramatic visual effects often accompanied by sexual themes.  Here, without any serious cursing (some mild) or acts of violence, or sexual innuendo (although there IS some subtle sensual overtone present in a couple of scenes) the plot unfolds mostly in a thoughtfully provoking manner where the momentum of the theme inexorably builds to an ultimate crescendo of sorts, with an expert twist of the plot for the final and fittingly complex emotional drama. I would say no more, in case you are reading this as a vehicle to determine your interest in partaking of the film.in a nutshell, if you have a predisposition to an imaginative exploration of the human condition in a most peculiar way, and are stimulated by discussions of religious and philosophical matters, you should enjoy the ride.  If, however, if you require visual and audio stimulations that keep your sub-woofer pumping and your eyes very busy, this is not for you.For me, though, this is about as good as any imaginative excursion I've ever experienced from any media source, and fascinatingly intoxicating.P.S.  this is not about an immortal man, but is about a very old one.",5,the epitome of a successful sci-fi writer's career,1271635200,"04 19, 2010",2010,2572,"['watched', 'yesterday', 'first', 'time', 'real', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'great', 'when', 'allow', 'movie/play', 'enfold', 'charms', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'impeding', 'was', 'really', 'big', 'SLEEPER', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'would', 'expect', 'even', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'minutes', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'continue', 'watch', 'conventional', 'lures', 'typical', 'moviegoers', 'anticipate', 'days', 'Instead', 'cerebral', 'stimulation', 'rarefied', 'pedigree', 'creator', 'Jerome', 'Bixby', 'been', 'toying', 'concepts', 'alter', 'dimensions', 'concept', 'time', 'career', 'writer', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'original', 'Star', 'Trek', 'series', 'as', 'well', 'own', 'fiction', 'novels', 'work', 'culmination', 'theme', 'was', 'developing', 'many', 'years', 'back', 'mind', 'story', 'enticing', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'stimulating', 'What', 'probably', 'most', 'amazing', 'achievement', 'utter', 'simplicity', 'set', 'cast', 'characters', 'resultant', 'impact', 'film', 'can', 'generate', 'attentive', 'viewer', 'require', 'open', 'mind', 'bit', ""'suspension"", 'disbelief', 'viewer', 'not', 'dissimilar', 'shown', 'characters', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'also', 'best', 'viewer', 'not', 'ALWAYS', 'require', 'what', 'typically', 'offered', 'up', 'films', 'today', '.excessive', 'visual', 'audio', 'stimulation', 'dramatic', 'visual', 'effects', 'often', 'accompanied', 'sexual', 'themes', 'Here', 'serious', 'cursing', 'mild', 'acts', 'violence', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'subtle', 'sensual', 'overtone', 'present', 'couple', 'scenes', 'plot', 'mostly', 'thoughtfully', 'provoking', 'manner', 'where', 'momentum', 'theme', 'inexorably', 'ultimate', 'crescendo', 'sorts', 'expert', 'twist', 'plot', 'final', 'fittingly', 'complex', 'emotional', 'drama', 'would', 'say', 'no', 'more', 'case', 'are', 'reading', 'vehicle', 'determine', 'interest', 'partaking', 'film.in', 'nutshell', 'have', 'predisposition', 'imaginative', 'exploration', 'human', 'condition', 'most', 'peculiar', 'way', 'are', 'stimulated', 'discussions', 'religious', 'philosophical', 'matters', 'should', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'however', 'require', 'visual', 'audio', 'stimulations', 'keep', 'sub-woofer', 'pumping', 'eyes', 'very', 'busy', 'not', 'you.For', 'though', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'imaginative', 'excursion', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'media', 'source', 'fascinatingly', 'intoxicating.P.S', 'not', 'immortal', 'man', 'very', 'old', 'one']",N/A

1097637,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000UYX4Q8,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[79, 87]","John Oldman (David Lee Smith) has been a history professor for ten years and is now preparing to move away from the school he's dedicated a decade to. The reasons are initially his own until a group of his fellow friends and professors come by to say goodbye and he drops a bombshell on them; he claims to be a caveman who's lived eons and eons, witnessing historical events and even being part of that history that we thought we knew.The group of professors that come by to send him off are a complex group: a religious studies professor, another that's an English prof, a psych prof, and a few others that round out a pretty decent world view.Initially all of John's fellow colleagues challenge him, but his arguments are solid and disturbing. But is John for real? Or does he need psychotropic medications?The thing about THE MAN FROM EARTH is that it's a stage-play put into film form. The entire movie is pure character exposition and dialogue with no action, flashbacks, or other techniques most movie-goers have become accustomed to. And this is both a strength and a weakness. The strength comes from the strong scripting of the dialogue that keeps the viewer interested and wondering how it will all pan out. The weakness is that it makes for incredibly slow pacing. Thankfully the The Man From Earth is only 87 minutes long, not stretching out its length and thus causing great yawns from the watchers.The other strength within the movie is the acting. All of the characters were believable and the actors and actresses played their parts very well (being frustrated or angry or sad or scared, etc.). But the filming was tough to watch. Too many times the shots looked grainy or underexposed, giving it a B-movie feel; that was unfortunate.Even so, this is an interesting treatise on humanity and how we might deal with the unexplainable should a friend thrust a near impossible quandary upon us.",4,Treatise On Human-Kind,1208563200,"04 19, 2008",2008,1906,"['John', 'Oldman', 'David', 'Lee', 'Smith', 'been', 'history', 'professor', 'ten', 'years', 'now', 'preparing', 'move', 'away', 'school', 'dedicated', 'decade', 'reasons', 'are', 'initially', 'own', 'group', 'fellow', 'friends', 'professors', 'come', 'say', 'goodbye', 'bombshell', 'be', 'caveman', 'who', 'lived', 'eons', 'eons', 'witnessing', 'historical', 'events', 'even', 'being', 'part', 'history', 'thought', 'knew.The', 'group', 'professors', 'come', 'send', 'off', 'are', 'complex', 'group', 'religious', 'studies', 'professor', 'English', 'prof', 'psych', 'prof', 'few', 'others', 'round', 'out', 'pretty', 'decent', 'world', 'view.Initially', 'John', 'fellow', 'colleagues', 'challenge', 'arguments', 'are', 'solid', 'disturbing', 'John', 'real', 'need', 'psychotropic', 'medications', 'thing', 'THE', 'MAN', 'FROM', 'EARTH', 'stage-play', 'put', 'film', 'form', 'entire', 'movie', 'pure', 'character', 'exposition', 'dialogue', 'action', 'flashbacks', 'other', 'techniques', 'most', 'movie-goers', 'have', 'become', 'accustomed', 'strength', 'weakness', 'strength', 'strong', 'scripting', 'dialogue', 'viewer', 'interested', 'wondering', 'how', 'will', 'all', 'pan', 'out', 'weakness', 'incredibly', 'slow', 'pacing', 'Thankfully', 'Man', 'From', 'Earth', 'only', '87', 'minutes', 'long', 'not', 'stretching', 'out', 'length', 'thus', 'causing', 'great', 'yawns', 'watchers.The', 'other', 'strength', 'movie', 'acting', 'characters', 'were', 'believable', 'actors', 'actresses', 'played', 'parts', 'very', 'well', 'being', 'frustrated', 'angry', 'sad', 'scared', 'etc.', 'filming', 'was', 'tough', 'watch', 'Too', 'many', 'times', 'shots', 'looked', 'grainy', 'underexposed', 'giving', 'B-movie', 'feel', 'was', 'unfortunate.Even', 'so', 'interesting', 'treatise', 'humanity', 'how', 'might', 'deal', 'unexplainable', 'should', 'friend', 'near', 'impossible', 'quandary']",N/A
1097638,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B000UYX4Q8,Brian Driver,"[1, 1]",".NO SPOILERS!!!Imagine a group of professors and friends are attending a going-away gathering, and one of them blurts out that he's been alive for 140 centuries--14,000 years.  What would you do?Well, more properly, what would THEY do?  A group of professors--people who love to intellectualize the improbable, to seek out empirical details to prove a thesis--THEY begin to ask questions of him, and out come the details.  His panel of interrogators are an anthropologist, a biologist, an archaeologist, a devout Christian who is an art historian, and one very upset psychologist.What follows is our movie, which is essentially an hour and a half argument-slash-discussion.  Given such a proposition--as well as being told there is essentially NO change in this film's setting other than stepping out into the yard--one would be prone to call this movie boring, unchallenging and a poor way to spend  90 minutes.But you couldn't be further from the truth.Our caveman, John Oldman (c'mon!), is forced into his revelation; the movie begins when he is cornered at his home after skipping out on the faculty's going-away party.  A few hints are dropped at the onset: among his sparse belongings is a very authentic-looking Van Gogh; he possesses a fascinating and very rare archeological artifact; and one of his friends says he hasn't aged a day in the 10 years they've been together.  As they pressure him for the reason for his sudden departure from their faculty he blurts his news: he's been alive since the age of Cro-Magnon man, some 7,000 plus generations ago (and boy, is he owed some Father's Day cards!).Obviously, his friends find it hard to believe, and the movie consists of their interrogation.  What follows is a more serious-minded ""Forrest Gump,"" as his observations inform the movie: from cave art to early migrations, from Sumerian to Indian to European to American cultures, from his interactions with Buddha to the founding of Christianity...John Oldman was there.What is fascinating is how well his story holds together, as well as how interesting it is.  If you find yourself questioning how such a topic could actually hold your attention, think: wouldn't you find it fascinating to meet such a man?  What questions would you ask him?  How would you try to poke holes in such a story?  As the characters here are college professors, they are no slouches when it comes to dissing out the facts behind these events and eras.So what IS the truth behind this story?  Is he a shyster attempting to delude his friends?  Or is he a caveman who has become a well-educated man (holding 10 doctorates). Of course, I won't reveal that detail.  What I will tell you, however, is that the movie is clever and enthralling, both from a historical point of view to the psychological: for if his tale IS true, what would such a confession do to OUR cultural, historical and religious beliefs?  When you're faced with eye-opening news about beliefs you always held to be sacrosanct, what happens to YOU?From John's supposed interaction with pagan mythology, through Buddhism, to modern religion, there are few sacred cows he is does not topple.  One line I particularly liked from the movie--a line spoken by John Oldman--is, ""Piety is not what the lessons bring to the people; it's a mistake they bring to the lessons.""I enjoyed ""The Man from Earth.""  I do believe it is a bit brief and could have benefited from a little more historical revelation--but I will tell  you that it has a terrific ending, one I really enjoyed.  In addition, it is well cast: David Lee Smith plays the caveman, and several other actors will be recognizable to you.  All handled their roles well and lent believability to this small but intelligent film.",4,"I Loved It, and Would Have Loved More",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",2012,3736,"['.NO', 'SPOILERS', 'Imagine', 'group', 'professors', 'friends', 'are', 'attending', 'going-away', 'gathering', 'one', 'out', 'been', 'alive', '140', 'centuries', '14,000', 'years', 'What', 'would', 'do', 'Well', 'more', 'properly', 'what', 'would', 'THEY', 'do', 'A', 'group', 'professors', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'intellectualize', 'improbable', 'seek', 'out', 'empirical', 'details', 'prove', 'thesis', 'THEY', 'begin', 'ask', 'questions', 'come', 'details', 'panel', 'interrogators', 'are', 'anthropologist', 'biologist', 'archaeologist', 'devout', 'Christian', 'who', 'art', 'historian', 'one', 'very', 'upset', 'psychologist.What', 'movie', 'essentially', 'hour', 'half', 'argument-slash-discussion', 'Given', 'proposition', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'told', 'essentially', 'NO', 'change', 'film', 'setting', 'other', 'stepping', 'out', 'yard', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'prone', 'call', 'movie', 'boring', 'unchallenging', 'poor', 'way', 'spend', '90', 'minutes.But', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'further', 'truth.Our', 'caveman', 'John', 'Oldman', ""c'mon"", 'forced', 'revelation', 'movie', 'when', 'cornered', 'home', 'skipping', 'out', 'faculty', 'going-away', 'party', 'few', 'hints', 'are', 'dropped', 'onset', 'sparse', 'belongings', 'very', 'authentic-looking', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'fascinating', 'very', 'rare', 'archeological', 'artifact', 'one', 'friends', ""n't"", 'aged', 'day', '10', 'years', ""'ve"", 'been', 'together', 'pressure', 'reason', 'sudden', 'departure', 'faculty', 'news', 'been', 'alive', 'age', 'Cro-Magnon', 'man', '7,000', 'generations', 'boy', 'owed', 'Father', 'Day', 'cards', '.Obviously', 'friends', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'movie', 'interrogation', 'What', 'more', 'serious-minded', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'observations', 'inform', 'movie', 'cave', 'art', 'early', 'migrations', 'Sumerian', 'Indian', 'European', 'American', 'cultures', 'interactions', 'Buddha', 'founding', 'Christianity', 'John', 'Oldman', 'was', 'there.What', 'fascinating', 'how', 'well', 'story', 'together', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'interesting', 'find', 'questioning', 'how', 'such', 'topic', 'could', 'actually', 'hold', 'attention', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'find', 'fascinating', 'meet', 'such', 'man', 'What', 'questions', 'would', 'ask', 'How', 'would', 'try', 'poke', 'holes', 'such', 'story', 'characters', 'here', 'are', 'college', 'professors', 'are', 'slouches', 'when', 'dissing', 'out', 'facts', 'events', 'eras.So', 'what', 'truth', 'story', 'shyster', 'attempting', 'delude', 'friends', 'caveman', 'who', 'become', 'well-educated', 'man', 'holding', '10', 'doctorates', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'detail', 'What', 'will', 'tell', 'however', 'movie', 'clever', 'enthralling', 'historical', 'point', 'view', 'psychological', 'tale', 'IS', 'true', 'what', 'would', 'such', 'confession', 'do', 'OUR', 'cultural', 'historical', 'religious', 'beliefs', 'When', ""'re"", 'faced', 'eye-opening', 'news', 'beliefs', 'always', 'held', 'be', 'sacrosanct', 'what', 'YOU', 'John', 'supposed', 'interaction', 'pagan', 'mythology', 'Buddhism', 'modern', 'religion', 'are', 'few', 'sacred', 'cows', 'not', 'topple', 'One', 'line', 'particularly', 'liked', 'movie', 'line', 'spoken', 'John', 'Oldman', 'Piety', 'not', 'what', 'lessons', 'bring', 'people', 'mistake', 'bring', 'lessons', 'enjoyed', 'Man', 'Earth', 'do', 'believe', 'bit', 'brief', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'little', 'more', 'historical', 'revelation', 'will', 'tell', 'terrific', 'ending', 'one', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'addition', 'well', 'cast', 'David', 'Lee', 'Smith', 'caveman', 'several', 'other', 'actors', 'will', 'be', 'recognizable', 'handled', 'roles', 'well', 'lent', 'believability', 'small', 'intelligent', 'film']",N/A

1097640,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B000UYX4Q8,buru buru piggu,"[10, 11]","The Man from Earth is one of my all-time favorite sci-fi films. I discovered it two or three years ago on file-sharing networks and very I'm glad I did. Without the p2p community, this wonderful low-budget indie film (made for $200,000) would probably never have received wide distribution, a fact publicly acknowledged by the film's producer, Eric Wilkinson.The Man from Earth isn't for everyone. It's a humanistic story centered around dialog, not one focused on technology and action sequences. It isn't glamorous and it isn't flashy. There are no big stars in it. No warp drives, lanky blue aliens, or fancy computer graphics. Nothing happens in it at all, really. Just a bunch of ordinary people sitting in a room talking. If this isn't your idea of fun, then you won't like this movie. But, if you give it a chance, you might find it as intriguing as I did.Because the entirety of the film takes place inside the small room of a cabin in the woods, some people may find it a bit slow. I didn't. I was captivated by the story and didn't feel a lag at all during the 85 minute runtime, a testament to the brilliant writing and strength of the acting. All that's happening is friends and colleagues of Professor John Oldman dropping by to wish him well as he prepares to depart and the discussion that ensues after he tells them he is 14,000 years old. He never ages, perpetually frozen in appearance as a man in his late thirties. Initially incredulous, as they talk, they begin to ponder ""what if"".This film explores the possibility of such a never-aging man with believability and wit, touching on the nature of humanity, spiritual/religious belief, and friendship. I especially enjoyed seeing Tony Todd (Dan, the anthropologist), who I'll always remember asCandyman.The Man from Earth is good old-fashioned, thought-provoking sci-fi of a bygone era, like that of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, or Ray Bradbury, from a time when the genre was driven by ideas and intricate story details rather than technology.

One had nothing to work with except the interaction between human beings facing the enormity of an idea.The John Oldman character could have been lying. It would have been a brilliant lie; he had all the angles figured out. But the asides with his love interest blew that idea away - unless, of course, he had succeeded in selling her the same lie.The scene at the end, however (sorry: look elsewhere for the spoiler!) let us know what was really happening.The immediacy and intimacy of this story, and the actor's performances, are what makes this movie great. The reactions from the cast were a marvelous inter play of the whole human intellectual and emotional spectrum. And it unfolded as beautifully as the recording of Beethoven's 7th symphony that John played by the fireplace.In fact the Beethoven was perfect. It's a slow, contemplative music that unfolds with inexorable determination, releasing all that attempts to hide from the scrutiny of the light. Just like the movie.If you require mind blowing visuals in sci-fi, look elsewhere. This film is not for you.

It has great acting, real people, real emotions, a setting that any of us could find ourselves in, carrying on in a conversation--that while may not be likely-- would certainly give cause to examine the meaning of things we call life.I found the movie incredibly thought-provoking. My initial thought was this is a younger ""Mr. Flint"" from 'Star Trek's ""Requiem for Methuselah,""' also written by Bixby.This is a great thinking man's science fiction film, and it is really too bad more films like this aren't made more often. The film is testament to the fact that a great sci-fi film can be made without spaceships, battles, aliens and special effects and still be entertaining!The extras include commentary from four individuals--Jerome Bixby's son (one of the producers) the director, one of the film's actors and an author covering Jerome Bixby's career. Some of the commentary, like many other films, is irreverent, but a great deal of it provides insight behind the making of a big film in a small package.The entire cast is great. While there are no big name actors here, there is certainly some great acting going on. The direction was excellent;  and his cast gives their best in each and every scene.I had feared, prior to watching the film, that this was going to be a bad low budget flick.

I find that some if not many people's reactions to challenges to very strongly held beliefs can be very extreme, even violent as demonstrated in this movie.Most of this movie concentrates on his ""friends"" and how they react. However, one cannot ignore the challenges to science, philosophy and religion. I would judge the challenges made to science, philosophy and religion in this film to be of the most superficial nature and at the worst a serious flaw in the plot development.This is where the film become misleading and stereotypic. For this former Cro-Magnon man to claim he was Christ and Budda, takes this film beyond being just ""possible."" And the theology to which he ascribes to Christ is so obviously an unsophisticated appeal to the commonplace misunderstanding of what is plainly taught in the Bible to anyone who has read the New Testament with an open mind, that it makes a mockery of his character, thereby lessening the characters believability.I would caution any viewer of this movie to not take seriously any philosophy that might be derived from it, or even find any satisfaction that any of a viewers preconceptions are validated.

Set at the farewell after-party for a beloved college professor, it picks up just as the departing prof announces to a small gathering of colleagues that he's been alive since the dawn of humanity. What follows is an uncut, stream-of-consciousness conversation between the confident subject and his bewildered, skeptical friends as they try to punch holes in his story and decide if he's spouting truth or fiction. The screenplay is a work of art, slowly gathering steam as the speaker's claims grow larger and wilder. At every step along the way, his audience analyzes the latest revelations from a variety of angles, working through their own misgivings and gradually convincing both themselves and the viewers that there might just be some fire beneath all the smoke. Sadly, the brilliant plot deserved a better production; bland, redundant camera angles capture a dozen performances on par with bad community theater. It's horribly overacted, with a clunky cast of misfits and journeymen that couldn't find chemistry in a high school textbook.

John Oldman, decides its time to leave his life as a college professor.  Wanting to take his leave with minimum fuss, his colleagues decide otherwise and arrive at his box filled residence with food and drink for an impromptu farewell, ensuring a room ripe with stereotypes for the story to play off of.  Against his own better judgment, John decides to reveal his ""real"" self to his friends, and comes forth with the news he is an ageless, 14,000 year old Cro -Magnon.  The recounting of his journey through the history of humankind is mesmerizing, and proves to be a tale with implications for all in his company provoking reactions from fascination to outrage, violence and disbelief to emotionally shattered.Wisely playing this all with great understatement, Davlid Lee Smith delivers a gently powerful performance as history's most emotionally guarded man letting down his guard for the first time to reveal the truth about who is really is. The excellent ensemble cast (despite a moment or two of some hamfisted acting, a hurdle unavoidable in any screenplay relying entirely on human language) lend a realistic believability to John's colleagues.An enormous relief from all the over-budgeted Hollywood costume and explosion dramas, this sensational little movie actually gets one to ponder some of the great questions as well as coming up with some provcative thought.

For the supporting casts, I did not quite feel they were the professors as portrayed in the show.

Maybe it's the making more of a stage production, than but movie production that caused this. But on the whole, I felt its not the fault of the supporting casts. They have acted well.It's a pity that not much publicity was made on the show. I cannot stress enough that it's a movie with a superb concepts.

There's the jokester, the controller, the thoughtful observer, the religious one, etc...Some of the dialog seems a little forced to me though.  Just how does one write dialog for scientists?  It's a challenge.  They're mostly normal people except for their speciality.  And I don't mean any disrespect, but with so much biblical scholarship and translation versions available, it's disappointing to have the person of faith be singularly devoted to a 17th century translation (King James) of the bible.  While I wouldn't call the film anti-Christian, I do not think it gives the best of Christian thought much of a chance to be expressed.

Although fiction may use real people and real events along with or instead of imaginary characters, my view is that it crosses the line and becomes an egregious act of slanderous defamation and calumnious denigration when it deliberately distorts the reality of a historically prominent figure and maliciously misrepresents historical events surrounding that person. So although I was initially intrigued by the unfolding of events in this movie, I eventually felt only disgust when I realized the multi-faceted implications of what they were stupidly suggesting...not merely smearing the ancestral origins of Jesus but venturing way beyond that to attack His teachings. Whereas modern Christianity has shifted the emphasis from the religion OF Jesus to a religion ABOUT Jesus, that is still not the same thing as a denial of His identity or a rejection of His words. Upon first hearing the erroneous accusation that Jesus used the term ""Master"" but not ""Father"", the first thing that came to mind was the first two words of The Lord's Prayer that Jesus authored: ""OUR FATHER"". The character of John Oldman never really offers any contemporary evidence that he was who he claimed to be. In my final take on the film, I realized that the author leaves enough room for personal interpretation (despite some of the unexpected revelations near the end pertaining to John's alleged family connection to Dr. Will Gruber that could have been loosely based on data-mining research) to at least allow a serious consideration of the distinct possibility that John Oldman is indeed certifiably crazy and as a deeply pathological liar, has convinced both himself and his professional associates that these grandiose delusions of divinity-flavored lunacy that have faithfully blossomed with the passing of time in the forever-fragrant garden of his psychotically-fertilized mind are indeed just as verifiably true as a caveman's encounter with pain when he sets his toes on fire to keep them warm.",1,The Man From Slanderville,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",2012,1999,"['SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'fiction', 'may', 'use', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'events', 'instead', 'imaginary', 'characters', 'view', 'line', 'egregious', 'act', 'slanderous', 'defamation', 'calumnious', 'denigration', 'when', 'deliberately', 'reality', 'historically', 'prominent', 'figure', 'maliciously', 'misrepresents', 'historical', 'events', 'surrounding', 'person', 'was', 'initially', 'intrigued', 'unfolding', 'events', 'movie', 'eventually', 'felt', 'only', 'disgust', 'when', 'realized', 'multi-faceted', 'implications', 'what', 'were', 'stupidly', 'suggesting', 'not', 'merely', 'smearing', 'ancestral', 'origins', 'Jesus', 'venturing', 'way', 'attack', 'teachings', 'Whereas', 'modern', 'Christianity', 'shifted', 'emphasis', 'religion', 'OF', 'Jesus', 'religion', 'ABOUT', 'Jesus', 'still', 'not', 'same', 'thing', 'denial', 'identity', 'rejection', 'words', 'first', 'hearing', 'erroneous', 'accusation', 'Jesus', 'used', 'term', 'Master', 'not', 'Father', 'first', 'thing', 'came', 'mind', 'was', 'first', 'two', 'words', 'Lord', 'Prayer', 'Jesus', 'authored', 'OUR', 'FATHER', 'character', 'John', 'Oldman', 'never', 'really', 'contemporary', 'evidence', 'was', 'who', 'claimed', 'be', 'final', 'take', 'film', 'realized', 'author', 'enough', 'room', 'personal', 'interpretation', 'unexpected', 'revelations', 'end', 'pertaining', 'John', 'alleged', 'family', 'connection', 'Dr.', 'Will', 'Gruber', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'loosely', 'based', 'data-mining', 'research', 'least', 'allow', 'serious', 'consideration', 'distinct', 'possibility', 'John', 'Oldman', 'indeed', 'certifiably', 'crazy', 'deeply', 'pathological', 'liar', 'convinced', 'professional', 'associates', 'grandiose', 'delusions', 'divinity-flavored', 'lunacy', 'have', 'faithfully', 'blossomed', 'passing', 'time', 'forever-fragrant', 'garden', 'psychotically-fertilized', 'mind', 'are', 'indeed', 'just', 'verifiably', 'true', 'caveman', 'encounter', 'pain', 'when', 'toes', 'fire', 'keep', 'warm']",N/A

The quality of the DVD was acceptable but looked pretty low-budget. The Blu-Ray version isn't stellar, but it looks at least as good as a good quality DVD.On to the fascinating concept: what if you could reach full maturity, say, late 30s in age, and stop aging? That's the claim of the central character, John Oldman (pun intended). This is where I think the film shines. John's description of his personal history is mesmerizing to observe, and he sounds absolutely believable given the outrageousness of the premise. The way he describes his memories and how he pieced his history together by reading accounts of human history after the fact rang true, and David Lee Smith's delivery was spot-on.But then there's the flawed execution. The peripheral characters, who feed and are fed by the unfolding narrative, serve a critical function in the story, but aren't nearly as well-written (or perhaps not as well-acted) as John Oldman's. These are John's good friends and colleagues, all of them scholars, who care enough for him to show up at his door unannounced to say good-bye as he's packing to leave town. Yet they begin to turn on him as soon as they get an inkling of what he claims to be. It's understandable that they'd be skeptical--but some of their behavior is less believable than John's story of his incredibly long life.If you're looking for modern science fiction, look elsewhere--there are no special effects.

1097691,A2Q1JIPJ8LDGOQ,B000UYX4Q8,mao_soup,"[1, 3]","I enjoyed this movie, though it feels more like a play and might work better that way. The premise for this movieis sci-fi (what if?) but the rest of the movie is philosophy--exploring how different people react to his assertion. Perhaps that is just my take on it, but I think if Bixby had focused more on how people react, playing up the archetypes (ie. the believer, the reluctant believer, the skeptic, the opposition etc.) the movie would have been better. He does have these archetypes mostly in place, but they should have been more starkly defined.Also, what do these people do once the lines are drawn? Well, for some inscrutable reason the Psychologist wants to pull a gun and test whether john is telling the truth. This kind of action should better be suited to a Philosopher, but there is no Philosophy professor in the movie (I think there should be one, incidentally, since this is a philosophical discussion. Also, this philosophical character would have the most interesting actions and would make the biggest impact on story interpretation). A big mistake is that Bixby explains why The Psychiatrist does this as ""His wife just died so he is on edge"". Excuse me??? Lame. His actions should result from his personal response to this challenge that John makes to his own world view. People don't like to be told what they believe isn't true. Often, when confronted with the truth, we resist it, or try to make it go away (kill it). I think that is a better explanation for wanting to shoot john. Or better yet, the scientist wants to shoot him as a way to test scientifically his claims. All of the characters want to test it, but of course the philosopher would contend that there really is no way to prove or disprove the validity of what he is saying.In line with this, I think the ending should have grown more organically from the beginning. For example, all of the people in turn kill John or some such. I think that would be better (granted it is done right) because I think it would be a fascinating look at human nature to show how in a matter of hours a bunch of friends could turn completely into people you don't recognize, even so much that they are willing to kill you. Ironically, it would be his friends who are the ones who are changing, not John, even though to them it appears he is the changed one. Just my take on a better ending, but I think the real interesting thing about this movie is the look at the people and how they respond to ""the truth."" I think this should be better explored and become the focus of the movie, because there is so much that could be explored about human nature and out own ideas of faith, science, and learning truth. I think it would be more interesting if they all want to shoot him for one reason or another. The believer-- because she wants to cover the truth so as to preserve faith; the scientist--to test his claim; the christian-- to cover over the truth so as to hold onto disprove religion; etc. etc.I did not like how at the end we are beaten over the head with ""the truth."" I think it should have been left more open ended to where we don't know if he was lying or telling the truth. Much more intriguing that way in my opinion.

Although mystified as to why he is leaving, a few of his closest friends, and the woman who loves him, gather in his small cabin to say good-bye. They keep pressing him for his ""real reason"" for leaving, and finally, after much hesitation, he says that he is 14,000 years old (give or take a century), and that he cannot stay in one place for too long, because people start to notice that he doesn't age.From that point on, his friends question him. Most are concerned that he is pulling some kind of elaborate (and unfunny) joke, while a few play along with it as though he were just posing an intellectual question (would it be possible for a man to live that long?). The discussion ranges over many subjects and over the course of many hours (in-movie time; the movie itself is quite short); one friend even calls in a psychiatrist (another friend of theirs) to evaluate his sanity.This is a warm-hearted, thoughtful, and moving movie. The friends all have an obvious love and concern for each other, and the discussion itself (can he prove it? if not, why not?) holds one's attention throughout.There is much more, but I don't want to spoil it. I will say that it is possible that some Christians might be offended. Also, the ending answers the question (is he or isn't he?) quite clearly, which I appreciate. I don't necessarily always care which way a movie ends, but I would like to have a clear ending. I rarely give 5 stars to any movie, but this one definitely earned it.

""No more than"" does no justice to the impact that THE MAN FROM EARTH exerts on the viewer.  Very nearly the entire movie involves a group of college professors sitting around a fire in a cabin discussing the mysteries of the universe and who and what we are. The conversation IS the plot, and we in the audience are as spellbound as the actors who are led to question some very basic assumptions of what it means to be human.  David Lee Miller is history professor John Oldman, who, inexplicably, resigns from his job as a teacher. His friends press him for a reason. Oldman considers not saying anything, but you could tell that he needed to unwind. His story: He is an immortal human, 14,000 years old. He has married innumerable times, fathered children, saw the rise and fall of civilizations, and most astoundingly, conversed with some Biblical figures, of whom he was one. His ""confession"" starts off as a hypothetical, like charades. His comrades play along, asking pertinent questions to dent his story.  But little by little, they accept him as what he says he is, and it is at this point, that we in the audience in the theater watching the audience on the screen do likewise.  We believe him because we want to. His words flow with the simplicity of truth. And that is the lesson of this tale: that all religion is based on filling in the gaps of barely recorded  truth with a covering that we wish were so.

Yet, this is one of the most mesmerizing sci-fi films I've seen in years.Written by the late Jerome Bixby, a renowned author of the genre, the film is set in a remote cabin on a very cold night.  A group of college professors have gathered to say goodbye to one of their colleagues (David Lee Smith), who has decided, without reasonable explanation, to move on.As they chat among themselves, Smith makes an extraordinary announcement: He is an immortal who has migrated through 140 centuries of evolution.Is Smith just pulling his friends' legs?  Is he insane?  Or, is he telling the truth?Over the next hour or so, these learned individuals, most of whom are scientists, probe Smith with questions and, after another of his startling revelations, find their own notions of history, religion and humanity shattered.Directed by Richard Schenkman, this literate film is exquisitely acted by a fine cast that includes John Billingsley, Ellen Crawford, William Katt, Annika Peterson, Richard Riehle, Alexis Thorpe and Tony Todd.

And what if your birthday - as in the date of your birth - was 14000 years ago?In The Man from Earth, a faculty member (David Lee Smith) of an unnamed college is suddenly leaving.  His colleagues show up as he is moving out of his house.  ""We can't let you leave without an appropriate farewell party!' his biologist friend exclaims.  And they question him mercilessly: Why is he leaving?  Where is he going?Suddenly, he decides to tell them that he was a Cro-Magnon man who just didn't die.

And we have some prime real estate in Florida to sell to you.But they play along, and ask questions, and more questions.  Suddenly, they don't like his answers.  Enough is enough.

But the director chose not to do this.  So the entire story is told inside a small, remote cabin, or on the porch outside.  Thus, this is not an action film!If the professor was 14000 years old, then he certainly had enough time to develop an idea of how he could prove it, in case he ever needed to do so.  For example, he might have met another person like himself.  How do you prove you don't age?  After awhile, you could develop enough wealth to pull a Bill and Melinda Gates, and use that wealth to support work to eradicate polio or world hunger.

But don't expect any secret cults or mind-bending visual effects. The whole film is academics talking in one room, most of the time in the dark! The premise of the movie is that a history professor reveals to his colleagues that he is a caveman who has been alive for 14,000 years. The idea is reminiscent of the old Twilight Zone episode Long Live Walter Jameson about a similar immortal. (Curiously, Jerome Bixby did write a Twilight Zone episode but not that one. He wrote the original story ""A Good Life,"" about the kid who wants everyone to ""think happy thoughts."")The movie is well-constructed and a captivating watch but it stumbles in a number of places. The film is at its best when it poses epistemological questions: how do we know things? What makes a story believable? The film is at its worst when it provides definite answers, from its spurious take on world religions to the final, emotional scene. Worse, is when Bixby goes all Shirley MacClaine on us and links the professor to famous moments in history. At least, the professor didn't claim to meet Cleopatra or Joan of Arc. The final effect is something like reading The da Vinci Code. It's engaging when you're in the midst of it, but when you're done, the whole thing evaporates without a trace.

1097714,A3B6D3A01L2AAD,B000UYX4Q8,"Sal Magnum ""refugee from Babylon""","[4, 48]","Yes friends, this IS quite a spectacle. No doubt triggered for release to coincide with the big Zeitgeist/Project Venus* push from our benevolent freemason overlords.* Note: While I agree nearly verbatim with the last two sections of the original Zeitgeist film, it is the first section that I take great issue with as a hound of truth and REAL history. There are several cash rewards offered to anyone who can prove the claims Zeitgeist makes concerning Biblical Christianity (much like there is for anyone who can prove the Theory of Evolution). And yes, you WILL have to provide sources that pre-date 19th century Theosophical writings, lol.The pretext to this film is a gathering of highly intelligent professors from an unnamed university that are a bit perplexed to see the sudden, unexplained departure of one of their colleagues for points unknown. Over the course of a bit of good-natured cajoling and a sip of whiskey, good John divulges his sordid past, much to the alternating chagrin, intrigue, anger and disbelief of his fellows.I must say, what follows IS the pinnacle of Darwinian fantasy. It is clear that Richard Dawkins would be outclassed by the likes of Jerome Bixby, as this film makes the best arguments philosophically, anthropologically and otherwise, that it possibly can within the narrow confines of its paradigm.That said, in order for one to be anything but mildly humored by its ""dignity restoring"" plot, one must first accept its premise that modern, mainstream ""scientific"" theories on anthropology are a foregone conclusion, beyond all debate. In other words (as any good evolutionist will earnestly tell you), they are established FAAAACT!But, for the sake of artistic license, and strict belief in the freedom of speech and expression, I gladly grant Bixby his whimsical premise and critique the film from there.Where Bixby goes astray is in creating a blatant attack on Biblical Christianity that is disguised as a clever, conceptual, sci-fi piece. The only ones apparently NOT fooled by this are Biblical, fundamentalist Christians (fundies, as I've heard it put, lol), such as myself, and the author himself, who quite obviously crafted the screenplay while raging (much like Dawkins) against the ""God of injustice"" he had created for himself, as he wrote revisionist line after unsubstantiated line attempting to undermine the Truth he was not willing to look full in the face.Like all good agnostics (i.e. atheists who have lost their faith) Bixby clings to Buddha, the philosopher of Nothingness, a religion that can safely coincide with his ""science.""** The Theory of Evolution, which is the science of Nothingness. Allow me to delineate. On the origins of our universe (from the evolutionary point of view):""We now know our universe is finite, NOT inifinte as once was thought. Given that it is ever-expanding, it must, by nature, have started from one central point. (No one should EVER confuse this central point with a Creator God, just as no one should EVER confuse Mitochondrial Eve or Y-Nuclear Adam with the Adam and Eve of Genesis!) This central point was once thought to be huge, then about the size of a golf ball, then about the size of a period at the end of a sentence, now we KNOW that it was, in essence, nothing.Something exploded from this Nothing and Everything now in existence came from that Something.You weren't there, so you can't tell us it didn't!This acceptance of the Everything that came from the Something that exploded from Nothing is NOT belief, how dare you equate it to the same sort of blind faith that allows morons to cling to Bronze Age myths?! Believing in Nothing is much more intellectually honest than believing in some sort of ""Sky Daddy!"" Your God is no better than a Spaghetti Monster or a dragon in the garage or the Easter Bunny or Santa Claus that I could dream up to control the darkened minds of simpletons. The Nothing is PROVEN FACT because God is NOT. Got it?Our universe is, as we have said, finite, but there is NO WAY anything, such as an infinite, all-powerful, all-knowing, omniprescent Creator God of perfect love and perfect justice can exist outside, within and all around it, as we refuse to believe in anything. We only accept facts. And the fact is, we just don't know.We DO accept the existence of tiny, invisible particles called neutrinos, however, that pass in, around, over and through everything--- no matter how solid--- by the billions and trillions and gadzillions per second. These incredible phenomena should never be confused with any notions about the omniprescence of God because we have made SCIENTIFIC calculations of them, and as we KNOW, God has NOTHING to do with REAL Science.""*  *  *Naturally, like all good Hollywood fare, the only opposition to the claims made by the film's protagonist is a bitter, dried-up old crone who is obviously sheltered and clings to her faith for lack of a real life. We who have actually never been granted the ivory tower escapist ""reality"" that makes such fantasy plausible, can only smile knowingly and give the propagators of such convenient myth kudos for fulfilling the prophecies of Romans 1, 2Peter 3 and 2Thessalonians 2, among others, assuring us of the soon return of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.The media always shows the fringe lunatics which call themselves Christians, NEVER the millions who live seeking to emulate Christ. Howard Camping, the militias, the Koran burner, pederast priests, the Westboro Baptists-- the media absolutely loves these people and the gullible gobble it up as it appeals to their preconceptions.Imagine seeing an old man (say, Noam Chomsky, for instance) paraded out with a billboard for McDonalds on his back, stickers for IBM, Starbucks and Chase Manhattan all across his lapels and a tatoo on his forehead proclaiming, ""Buy at Walmart!"" And then envision your media telling you that this was emblematic of what an anarchist (or libertarian socialist) was! Would you feel like you were getting a straight scoop? No? Yet, most in the modern world buy into the EXACT same kind of bilge when it is fed them about Biblical, fundamentalist Christians. Quite telling. Only in a culture that ""educates"" itself so thoroughly, as ours does, are such laughably preposterous notions propagated and embraced.How this movie could be anything but an openly hostile attack against Christianity is beyond any serious analysis. The very premise is based on the modern myths of anthropology that were dreamed up to undermine Genesis. The film even admits that there were no real differences between ""Cro-magnons"" and modern man. It is all just inference to fit preconception, like the rest of Darwinian theory.Then to equate Christ to a cave dweller who somehow manages to live forever, to totally undermine the account of the crucifixion and to hold Buddha as the master Christ studied under...the type of sordid rubbish only the truly naive could swallow.Of course, that is the purpose of ""higher education,"" to allow the naive to think they actually know something about something. The blind leading the blind-- they both end up in the ditch, as Christ said. Look around you at the world the Darwinians have shaped over the past hundred years for proof of how ""enlightened"" they are. ""The fear of the Lord is the BEGINNING of wisdom."" The Bible proclaims, and if your front page news is not indicative of this truth, than you are suffering from willful ignorance and delusion, the like of which only Christ can release you from.Anyone who would like to view the matter from the other side, from men who have spent their lives in actual research (outside of 19th century Theosophical revisionist sources like Madame Blavatsky and Albert Pike), check out the short book, ""The Lotus and the Cross: Jesus Talks With Buddha"" by Ravi Zacharias and also the 3 disc film set by Lee Strobel, The Case for Christ, The Case for Faith, and The Case for a Creator.It's fine to sit back like Richie Dawkins and commend yourself that you have some sort of intellectual superiority over the ""duped followers of Bronze Age myth,"" but if you do not challenge your preconceptions with the best counter-arguments, what kind of scholar are you?There are three fundamentals in this existence which the pinnacle of modern science and philosophy can in no way account for. Life, that which makes this existence possible; Light and Love, that which gives this existence purpose and meaning. If you can come up with ANY idea outside of Biblical Christianity that can account for these three fundamentals to our existence, feel free to let me know.Peace unto you all, and may God continue to guide you on your search for Truth.",1,The Pinnacle of Darwinian/Theosophist/Buddhist Fantasy,1306540800,"05 28, 2011",2011,8692,"['Yes', 'friends', 'IS', 'quite', 'spectacle', 'doubt', 'triggered',

1097719,A3FEQXNCFC68KC,B000UYX4Q8,"SRFireside ""ZOOM!""","[3, 3]","If you are looking for a film that's cerebral and though-provoking as well as simple in execution you won't get any closer than Man from Earth. All this movie is is a group of professors in a cabin talking. That's it. Sounds boring? Well if you HAVE to have explosions and punchy one-liners then maybe it will be for you. But just like a masterful Akira Kurosawa film the simplicity of this format belies a movie that can get you swept away if you let it.The real meat of the movie is in the script and dialog. The plot in a nutshell is John, a professor of ten years with a university, decides to leave and gives a send off for his fellow professors. It is then that he decides to tell them he has actually lived for 14,000 years. Did I give away the movie? Nah. That's given away in the first ten minutes of the film. What follows is a intense discussion on what John's claims implies. This being a room full of professors just makes the conversation that much more interesting.Each of the professors bring to the table not only their expertise in their field, but also varying personalities and statures on how they take the revelation that John is pretty much a caveman. This ranges from analytical interest, self-posturing doubt, light-hearted banter, skeptical interest, and outright denial. The actors selected make up a good cast. You get to see John Billingsley of Star Trek Enterprise fame out of his Dr. Flox makeup, which was a treat for this sci-fi fan. Candyman's Tony Todd (who was on a couple Star Trek DS9 episodes) makes for a good foundation character. Richard Riehle from Office Space comes out with a pretty impressive performance overall (IMDB says he was on some Star Trek episodes too... do I detect a pattern?). David Lee Smith as our Caveman John gives a solid if understated performance (IMDB says he was on ST: Voyager. There is a pattern!).What this all culminates into is some pretty deep discussions about our perceptions of history and religion as well as topics like mortality, society, psychology and some interesting thoughts on how John lives as long as he has. Really. This can draw you in and even shock you.Let me be the first to say this is a low budget movie in many levels. Even though the film was released just a few years ago it has the look of something made much longer than that. If I didn't know better I probably would have pegged this a late 90's low budget movie. That's how low budget it is. It's not just the fact every happens on or around a cabin in the woods, but the lighting and cinematography also make it feel dated. The soundtrack is practically muted and unmemorable. Just saying this so you will be prepared for it. This fact really doesn't detract from the movie.The Blu-Ray transfer is... well... better than the DVD. However that doesn't mean much. The transfer for most is going to look horrible if you're used to the latest high definition transfers. I have to admit they could have done better, or maybe at least try to do some remastering. As it stands the picture is the best you can get, but only by a margin. Audio is in Dolby 5.1, but that doesn't really matter because the movie's audio doesn't take much advantage of it. No TrueHD, but then again that would have been a waste of bandwidth.You would think with the extra space on a Blu-Ray you would get extras, but that is not to be. Not even the extras from the DVD were transferred over. None of the commentaries. None of the four documentaries and featurettes from the DVD.The Man from Earth is a really amazing film that challenges as much as it provokes deep thought. However if you ask me there isn't enough good in this Blu-Ray to warrant its purchase. The picture is only a little better than the DVD, and I'm betting a good upscaling DVD player will narrow that gap, The audio is the same. Worst of all none of the special features and commentaries from the DVD. If you REALLY want it in high definition I would wait until they make a proper release. Otherwise stick with the DVD.",3,Intense and interesting.

1097720,AJ1XZYGXJGKU4,B000UYX4Q8,Stephen C. Coyle,"[10, 14]","As an atheist living in a Christian-dominated world, it's somewhat refreshing to see a movie where the main character is also an atheist.John Oldman (the main character) is approximately 14,000 years old and has seen so much of mankind's history unfold firsthand that it would make a historian drool. John relates the story of his past to a small group of his friends. They include a biologist, a college professor, a historian, an anthropologist, an archaeologist and a psychiatrist. Because this is such an educated group of professionals I object to them referring to John as a ""caveman"". With their advanced levels of education it would make more sense that they would refer to him as a ""Neolithic man"", a ""Cro-Magnon"" or perhaps simply an ""ancient"" or ""immortal"".Calling John a ""caveman"" is the sort of intellectually lazy thing I would expect from a high school dropout. Not a college professor or an anthropologist. I understand that many Christians have been offended by this movie as the main character refers to the stories in the Bible as ""myths"" and he even claims that the myth of Jesus rising from the dead was inspired by him when he faked his own death 2,000 years ago and his followers caught him sneaking out of his own tomb.TOO BAD! Christians have dominated America for decades! And most movies, TV shows, political campaigns and mass marketing campaigns were geared towards pleasing them!

He chooses to gather a group of biblical scolars and evolutionary biologists and experts in cavemen art , to tell them 'the real story'but from his perspective.When he sees that the people he invited are a no - nonsense party , he decides to let each one of them reach his or her conclusion without the slightest need to test anyone. He has incredible reflexes and can easily tune himself in on the emotions of all around him. He manages to show using simple arguments that paeolithic culture wasn't stupid , or unable to cope with advanced technology , but the concept of technologically advanced supercultures is never discussed - instead he seems to have been a lone traveller of sorts , a hermit who passes his knowledge on from one generation of listeners to the next. The thesis of the film is that it will take mankind hundreds , if not thousands of years to become extinct , but even as that proceeds , it will seem like a tiny , puny , insignificant split in a second on evolution's imagined timescale.The film ends when everyone realizes they can accept this information and explain the validity of it's content with each other , and have memories of past lives on this planet and even future ones.The Christ myth is exposed but humbly and from the perspective of enormous respect to it's original interpreters as well as a few of it's makers. In this movie , the fundamental details of all the knowledge systems of monotheistic religions are explained from what many might call today 'a Satanic perspective'- or freethought , without much emphasis on the concept of freethought itself.This is not only a movie about the evolution of freethought and early man , it is about modern man exploring himself in light of the facts that surround this process , without much emphasis on the freethought concept itself , or related concepts. This is a film for everybody , and not just freethinkers or traditional modern day satanists , but everyone , including Buddhists , Christians , methodists , conspiracy researchers , anyone. Particularly our ancestors. Before I had begun watching this movie I had seen Henry; Portrait of a Serial Killer in one and a half hour setting. It's the warmest campfire tale movie I've seen so far , and it's somehow far easier to do campfire tale movies than to do Lovecraftian horror films.As the audience listens to the sound of the campfire and the campfire conversation the whole campfire concept itself is forgotten and people are taken back into time , where a tiny portion of everything is explained in a manner which satisfies the viewer almost 100%.",5,the coming end of the current era by means of environmental and evolutionary changes,1244419200,"06 8, 2009",2009,3126,"['Man', 'Earth', 'surviving', 'man', 'upper', 'paeolinthic', 'pyramid', 'mound', 'building', 'cultures', 'dating', '10', '000', '60', '000', 'years', 'BC', 'earlier', 'who', 'invite', 'friends', 'party', 'hope', 'be', 'informed', 'impending', 'end', 'era', 'current', 'civilization', 'where', 'environment', 'may', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'have', 'seen', 'species', 'come', 'go', ""extinct'he"", 'warns', 'story', 'easily', 'need', 'correct', 'misunderstanding', 'gather', 'group', 'biblical', 'scolars', 'evolutionary', 'biologists', 'experts', 'cavemen', 'art', 'tell', 'real', ""story'but"", 'perspective.When', 'people', 'invited', 'are', 'nonsense', 'party', 'let', 'one', 'reach', 'conclusion', 'slightest', 'need', 'test', 'anyone', 'incredible', 'reflexes', 'can', 'easily', 'tune', 'emotions', 'show', 'using', 'simple', 'arguments', 'paeolithic', 'culture', 'was', ""n't"", 'stupid', 'unable', 'cope', 'advanced', 'technology', 'concept', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'supercultures', 'never', 'discussed', 'instead', 'have', 'been', 'lone', 'traveller', 'sorts', 'hermit', 'who', 'knowledge', 'one', 'generation', 'listeners', 'next', 'thesis', 'film', 'will', 'take', 'mankind', 'hundreds', 'not', 'thousands', 'years', 'become', 'extinct', 'even', 'proceeds', 'will', 'seem', 'tiny', 'puny', 'insignificant', 'split', 'second', 'evolution', 'imagined', 'timescale.The', 'film', 'when', 'everyone', 'can', 'accept', 'information', 'explain', 'validity', 'content', 'other', 'have', 'memories', 'past', 'lives', 'planet', 'even', 'future', 'ones.The', 'Christ', 'myth', 'exposed', 'humbly', 'perspective', 'enormous', 'respect', 'original', 'interpreters', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'makers', 'movie', 'fundamental', 'details', 'knowledge', 'systems', 'monotheistic', 'religions', 'are', 'explained', 'what', 'many', 'might', 'call', 'today', 'Satanic', ""perspective'-"", 'freethought', 'much', 'emphasis', 'concept', 'freethought', 'itself.This', 'not', 'only', 'movie', 'evolution', 'freethought', 'early', 'man', 'modern', 'man', 'exploring', 'light', 'facts', 'surround', 'process', 'much', 'emphasis', 'freethought', 'concept', 'related', 'concepts', 'film', 'everybody', 'not', 'just', 'freethinkers', 'traditional', 'modern', 'day', 'satanists', 'everyone', 'including', 'Buddhists', 'Christians', 'methodists', 'conspiracy', 'researchers', 'anyone', 'Particularly', 'ancestors', 'had', 'begun', 'watching', 'movie', 'had', 'seen', 'Henry', 'Portrait', 'Serial', 'Killer', 'one', 'half', 'hour', 'setting', 'warmest', 'campfire', 'tale', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'so', 'far', 'somehow', 'far', 'easier', 'do', 'campfire', 'tale', 'movies', 'do', 'Lovecraftian', 'horror', 'films.As', 'audience', 'sound', 'campfire', 'campfire', 'conversation', 'whole', 'campfire', 'concept', 'forgotten', 'people', 'are', 'taken', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'tiny', 'portion', 'everything', 'explained', 'manner', 'viewer', 'almost', '100', '%']",N/A

These are university educators, intelligent people, who have an obviously tight knit group, that seems to orbit around the central figure, John.In a moment of emotional weakness, where it really sets in that he's leaving these friends forever, probably the best group of friends he's ever known, and for undisclosed reasons, he takes a bold step and reveals to his colleagues, that he has lived for over 14,000+ years, and was born a paleolithic caveman.What follows is an interesting take on how someone like that sees the world, evolving as the world of mankind evolved, always an observer, and sometimes an outcast, and how he struggled through 200 lifetimes, to stay alive, and adapt.There is a central focus on philosophical and theological debate and doubt between the characters, which rages through most of the rest of the film. The caveman can only relate his experiences, which will certainly offend many people, but you need to rise above your own take on things, and try to focus on how interestingly the concept of immortality was presented, as opposed to the usual vampire tale, THE PORTRAIT OF DORIAN GRAY or HIGHLANDER.If you can keep an open mind, you'll enjoy this intelligent foray into the life of one who would surely be the loneliest human that ever lived.

Most enjoyable for me, is that I knew of the movie only by word of mouth and I had no foreknowledge of the plot or storyline and thus no idea whether the main character really was a 14,000 year old man or not which made the viewing all the more interesting and enjoyable as my mind spun around trying to pick up clues as to whether Professor Oldman was for real or playing the hoax of hoaxes.There were some moments where I got creeped out as I was beginning to think that the movie was going to take a turn towards the supernatural and sinister because I had no idea who the character really was or what he was capable of.I recommend this movie to people with active imaginations and who like to think and ponder on the strange and fantastic.
