Chesterton, Greek mythology, and the Keystone Cops thrown in.  Helprin's version of magical realism; I'm a fan.  I thought for years about what a movie version would look like.This wasn't it.Not to say it's a 'bad' movie.  It's well-written, brilliantly shot, beautifully designed and features a compelling score.  But Colin Farrell is just not Peter Lake as I would have envisioned him from the book. Nor does Jessica Findlay match the description of Beverly Penn. Russell Crowe is workable as Pearly Soames, but the whole treatment of the Short Tails failed for me.  And where was Jackson Mead?  Hello? Major charactor?  Finally, as much as I hate to say this, I'm growing bored with Will Smith, the 'movie star'.One more rant:  The whole demon/Lucifer concept was a fail, as is Hollywood's perception that they have to spoon feed the finer points of allegory to the wallowing masses.Overall, 'Winter's Tale' is a nice love story that's vaguely reminiscent of 'Winter's Tale', but it's NOT Winter's Tale.  I'm guessing we'll have to wait about 10 years before someone takes a crack at a remake.

Ad...","[3, 4]","This movie was so beautifully filmed.It  came across as a charming adult fairy tale, but with enough grittiness in the plot and characters to not to put the menfolk to sleep while watching it.Unfortunately, the original book written decades ago, is quite a tome, and so the story is very involved, with complex situations and characters.There is also a spiritual/metaphysical bent to the theme of the story and, fortunately, some of that manages to be captured here on film.Martin Scorsese brought the rights to the film( from what I understand) and then, he wisely understood how there was no way a movie could do justice to the book- it would  be tremendously difficult to condense such a story into a reasonable amount of film time.While all the actors are fantastic in their roles, and the cinematography is breathtaking, so many things were lost in this effort to bring the book to screen.2/3rds of the  movie is magical to watch, even if not totally following the book.(You are getting the skeleton of the book here and a bit disjointed at that,as not all is in order)Because you are enchanted by what you are watching- initially- you cut that fact slack, because you get sucked into this lovely, gorgeous but adulterated/abbreviated version of the story.So,  visually,  you really enjoy this movie until the last 3rd, when it takes a large turn in the story line.Those who will be most disappointed in the movie plot, are the ones who read the book it was based on.Those who never read the book will see this as a movie that started off with promise and sort of withers away.Still watchable- but there may be confusion,questions- even some questioning how the book could have been that good.In truth- the book is good if wordy!It just does not translate easily to screen.So if you never read the book, enjoy what you can out of this feature.While it never touches all the magic and emotion that the book offers a reader- there is still much here to enjoy, so enjoy it!",4,Martin Scorsese right:No way to make book into a movie,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,1975,"['movie', 'was', 'so', 'beautifully', 'filmed.It', 'came', 'charming', 'adult', 'fairy', 'tale', 'enough', 'grittiness', 'plot', 'characters', 'not', 'put', 'menfolk', 'sleep', 'watching', 'it.Unfortunately', 'original', 'book', 'written', 'decades', 'ago', 'quite', 'tome', 'so', 'story', 'very', 'involved', 'complex', 'situations', 'characters.There', 'also', 'spiritual/metaphysical', 'bent', 'theme', 'story', 'fortunately', 'be', 'captured', 'here', 'film.Martin', 'Scorsese', 'brought', 'rights', 'film', 'what', 'understand', 'then', 'wisely', 'understood', 'how', 'was', 'way', 'movie', 'could', 'do', 'justice', 'book-', 'would', 'be', 'tremendously', 'difficult', 'condense', 'story', 'reasonable', 'amount', 'film', 'actors', 'are', 'fantastic', 'roles', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'lost', 'effort', 'bring', 'book', 'screen.2/3rds', 'movie', 'magical', 'watch', 'even', 'not', 'totally', 'following', 'book', 'are', 'getting', 'skeleton', 'book', 'here', 'bit', 'disjointed', 'not', 'order', 'are', 'enchanted', 'what', 'are', 'watching-', 'initially-', 'cut', 'fact', 'slack', 'get', 'sucked', 'lovely', 'gorgeous', 'adulterated/abbreviated', 'version', 'story.So', 'visually', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'last', '3rd', 'when', 'large', 'turn', 'story', 'line.Those', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'most', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'plot', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'on.Those', 'who', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'will', 'see', 'movie', 'started', 'off', 'promise', 'sort', 'withers', 'away.Still', 'watchable-', 'may', 'be', 'confusion', 'questions-', 'even', 'questioning', 'how', 'book', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'good.In', 'truth-', 'book', 'good', 'wordy', 'just', 'not', 'translate', 'easily', 'screen.So', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'enjoy', 'what', 'can', 'out', 'feature.While', 'never', 'magic', 'emotion', 'book', 'reader-', 'still', 'much', 'here', 'enjoy', 'so', 'enjoy']",Winter's Tale

1693623,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00I6JOD8M,Darren,"[3, 6]","Once about every 5 or 10 years, a mainstream theatrical release with A-list actors comes along that's so bizarre that it beggars belief.  ""Winters Tale"" is the latest.  Oh man oh man.  What a lulu.  In fact, Russell Crowe, playing an executive demon named Pearly Soames (why not just call him ""Pearly Gates""?), calls Lucifer ""Lu"" at one one point.  Lucifer, by the way, is played by Will Smith.  I ... wait.  I don't --OK, look.  I tried to accept the premise that the world depicted here is a meant to be parallel world to our own with its own set of rules.  Rules, by the way, that I ardently wished that I could understand.  Well, ok, when I say ""world"", I really mean New York City (I think?).  Nothing is outside it, although we hear tell of cities like Baltimore and Boston.  Outside the city there's an old house owned by the city's newspaper editor (William Hurt).  It's a magical place where demons are not allowed to go.  Yes, I just wrote that.  Anyhow, in this world (we'll just keep calling it that, I guess), if you get tuberculosis, you need to be kept in the cold like a perishable foodstuff.  When you start warming up, you can't breathe and your feet start melting the snow under them.  I understand the movie was based on a 30-year-old novel; perhaps in the novel all of this seems less insane.But because the movie is so stingy with its revelations about the rules of the world it has created, we spend much of the time utterly bewildered.  We smirk at the fundamentalist Christianity tossed into the Mixmaster with New Age hokum (very trendy and taken pretty seriously in 1983).  We roll our eyes at the dialogue.  Colin Farrell to Graham Greene: ""You mean, the God and the Devil?""  Greene: ""That's some of their newer names, yes.""  In another scene, Jessica Brown Findlay: ""What's the best thing you've ever stolen?""  Farrell (looking intently at her): ""I think I haven't stolen it yet.""  Findlay: ""Oh my, you're a charmer.""  (Egads.)  We wonder what Farrell has been doing with himself between 1914 and 2014.  Has he been lurking around Central Park the WHOLE time?  Polluting the sidewalks with his art that looks like that spray-art stuff featuring unicorns?  Mostly, though, we laugh at the White Horse.  Now, the White Horse was a figure of fun at least as far back as Mel Brooks' ""History of the World Part 1"".  We had thought Brooks had mercy-killed the White Horse for good.  But the White Horse reappeared, without irony, in Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy about a decade ago.  No one made fun of it, so apparently it's back to stay.  Well, this one's an *angelic* White Horse.  It's got shimmery CGI wings!  Early in the proceedings, Farrell, atop the White Horse, leaps over Crowe and his gang of demons.  The camera goes to Crowe, who says:  ""He's got the damn Horse!""I should've turned this movie off right then and there, but I can't deny that I rubberneck accidents on the freeway like everyone else.  I couldn't turn away.  1 out of 5.  If Mike, Crow T. Robot, and Tom Servo get ahold of it, then it's 5 out of 5.

This narrative pratfall destroys any value inherent in other aspects of this production (cinematography, sets, acting, etc.).Not recommended.PS.

1693634,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00I6JOD8M,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Writer/director/producer Akiva Goldman has adapted Mark Helprin's 1983 novel for the screen and has made it even more a work of magical realism than the book alone. The film is stunning to watch, the story has many levels of meaning that embrace the such topics as immortality, good versus evil, miracles, death and dying and transcendent love, and it is cast with a collection of superb actors who take us with them through this fantasy of time and love and redemption.There are many meaningful passages of dialogue, but one that Beverly offers is the essence of the story: ``We are all connected. Each baby born carries a miracle inside. A unique purpose and that miracle is promised to one person and one person alone. We are voyagers set on a course towards destiny, to find the one person our miracle is meant for. But be warned: as we seek out the light, darkness gathers and the eternal contest between good and evil is not fought with great armies... But one life at a time.'One summary is excellent: `New York City is subsumed in arctic winds, dark nights, and white lights, its life unfolds, for it is an extraordinary hive of the imagination, the greatest house ever built, and nothing exists that can check its vitality. One night in winter, Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), orphan and master-mechanic, attempts to rob a fortress-like mansion on the Upper West Side. Though he thinks the house is empty, the daughter of the house is home. Thus begins the love between Peter, a middle-aged Irish burglar, and Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay), a young girl, who is dying. A burglar falls for an heiress as she dies in his arms. When he learns that he has the gift of reincarnation, he sets out to save her.' The film moves from early 1895 where parents (Matt Bomer and Lucy Griffiths) being refused entry into America set their infant son in a little boat to send him to America. We then are in 1914 when the above action occurs - colored by the shenanigans of Judge/Lucifer (Will Smith) and the evil Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). Later we follow the still living and unchanged Peter Lake to 2014, joined by Virginia Gamely (Jennifer Connelly) as he completes his miracle of saving the life of a younger redhead. A magnificent white horse plays a major role; Eva Marie Saint, William Hurt and other supporting actors are excellent. The musical score concentrates on Brahms, Berlioz, Khachaturian and others during the film - but someone opted to place a pop tune during the credits that is completely devoid of any of the graceful mystery of the film.

It's core is the war between good and evil and we are treated to an interesting perspective of demon's and their territorial rule under their great leader Satan himself. The idea of angels seems to be a side note and although Russell Crowe's character Pearly mentions them in the trailer in reference to Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) I am not sure that line was actually in the movie (I was distracted at times by my popcorn). Cecil Mature (Maurice Jones) who acts as a friend to Peter (Farrell) is obviously some sort of fantasy character and probably meant to be an angel but I missed where that was made apparent. There is a white horse that is a spirit guide that also flies  though, so that's something to get excited about right? Didn't we just see this same spirit guide in The Lone Ranger, standing in a tree?To be frank you are not going to be inspired by this love story. It is not compelling. If you were like me and were dooped by the trailer where Farrell says he is robbing the place and then gets invited to tea... you will be sadly disappointed. That was the extent of how clever this plot gets. If there had been some exciting fight scenes I might have jacked up the star allotment but that was limited too.I give Crowe full points on being a New Zealander who pulls off the Irish Brogue but he is no Brad Pitt playing a Pikey. If you have the money and time to waste on a fantasy love story that I dare you not to yawn through then see it. If you value your time and prefer not to waste your money... wait until this comes out on Prime for free or someone else pays for the rental.

Mark Helprin is an extraordinary writer, with a strong command of language and a remarkable ability to weave together numerous characters and complex plots with mastery and beauty.  It was a book I didn't want to end and after it did, I wanted to read it again.  I was mesmerized by the wonder of it's mystical quality coupled with a powerful realistic representation of  New York City during the era it depicts.  I did not feel the same connection with the movie.  Although the acting is good, the movie falls short on capturing the true essence of the book.  The movie has taken one facet of the book and expanded upon it, but in doing so, has also diluted significant factors that created the impact of this piece of the story.

1693681,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B00I6JOD8M,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","WINTER'S TALE is a slightly hokey, but thoughtful, tale about love and miracles with gentle performances by Colin Farrell, Jessica Findlay Brown and Jennifer Connelly. Based on a novel by Mark Helprin, the story is about a man named Peter Lake, a thief with mysterious beginnings who falls in love with a woman whose house he sets out to rob. He's also accompanied by a flying white horse, and being pursued by his former employer, Pearly Soames, played with gusto by Russell Crowe. I would describe the plot a little more, but it's hard to go into too much detail without giving everything away. Suffice it to say, there's a lot of talk about light, stars, destiny and miracles. And also, if it wasn't already apparent from the get-go, this movie takes place in a fantastical version of reality in which angels and demons exist in human form, and seek to influence the world around them. I thought that the movie did a good job of establishing the fictional world in which this takes place, even though not everything is explained in great detail. Of course, not everything needs to be explained to death anyway, and I appreciate that this film didn't dwell too much on needless exposition. The film can be divided into two parts: one that takes place in 1916, and the second half in present-day. The setting doesn't change, but a select few characters exist in both time periods, for reasons best left for the viewer to find out on their own. At its heart this is a love story, and a fairly compelling one at that. Enough time is given to the development of the central relationship to make it feel believable, even though it begins quite surreptitiously. In general, I felt like the film was emotionally moving in all the right ways, and had a nice story arc. However, despite the good (yet unorthodox) story, there were a few things which let me down. First of all, Russell Crowe seemed miscast as the main villain. He chews the scenery in an awkward way, and puts on a ridiculous Irish accent. John Hurt also has a small role as Colin Farrell's girlfriend's father, and I felt like he gave a poor performance, or at least one that didn't live up to the good performances around him. And although not bad, per se, there was an unexpected cameo which kind of felt out of place. I went into this film knowing who it was, but it would be better for the viewer to go in without such knowledge. In terms of technical quality, the cinematography was decent, but nothing outstanding and the visual effects were also passable, although a little bit cheesy. I, however, did like the score and incidental music they used. It accentuated the material quite nicely and helped to punctuate emotional moments during the film. I also liked the song ""Miracle"" which played during the closing credits. Overall, I thought this was a decent directorial debut from Akiva Goldsman, who doesn't have the greatest record as a writer (and also wrote and produced this film). The magical realism was something fresh to me, and an antidote from lots of movies that try too hard to be ""realistic."" The story was something easy to get behind, even if it did resort to cliche at times. And despite the shortcomings, this is something I can recommend, if only because it tries hard enough to stand out.",4,"My review of ""Winter's Tale""",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,3276,"['WINTER', 'TALE', 'slightly', 'hokey', 'thoughtful', 'tale', 'love', 'miracles', 'gentle', 'performances', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Jessica', 'Findlay', 'Brown', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Based', 'novel', 'Mark', 'Helprin', 'story', 'man', 'named', 'Peter', 'Lake', 'thief', 'mysterious', 'beginnings', 'who', 'falls', 'love', 'woman', 'house', 'out', 'rob', 'also', 'accompanied', 'flying', 'white', 'horse', 'being', 'pursued', 'former', 'employer', 'Pearly', 'Soames', 'played', 'gusto', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'would', 'describe', 'plot', 'little', 'more', 'hard', 'go', 'too', 'much', 'detail', 'giving', 'everything', 'away', 'Suffice', 'say', 'lot', 'talk', 'light', 'stars', 'destiny', 'miracles', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'already', 'apparent', 'get-go', 'movie', 'place', 'fantastical', 'version', 'reality', 'angels', 'demons', 'exist', 'human', 'form', 'seek', 'influence', 'world', 'thought', 'movie', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'establishing', 'fictional', 'world', 'place', 'even', 'not', 'everything', 'explained', 'great', 'detail', 'course', 'not', 'everything', 'needs', 'be', 'explained', 'death', 'anyway', 'appreciate', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'needless', 'exposition', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'divided', 'two', 'parts', 'one', 'place', '1916', 'second', 'half', 'present-day', 'setting', ""n't"", 'change', 'select', 'few', 'characters', 'exist', 'time', 'periods', 'reasons', 'best', 'left', 'viewer', 'find', 'out', 'own', 'heart', 'love', 'story', 'fairly', 'compelling', 'one', 'Enough', 'time', 'given', 'development', 'central', 'relationship', 'make', 'feel', 'believable', 'even', 'quite', 'surreptitiously', 'general', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'right', 'ways', 'had', 'nice', 'story', 'arc', 'However', 'good', 'yet', 'unorthodox', 'story', 'were', 'few', 'things', 'let', 'down', 'First', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'seemed', 'miscast', 'main', 'villain', 'scenery', 'awkward', 'way', 'ridiculous', 'Irish', 'accent', 'John', 'Hurt', 'also', 'small', 'role', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'girlfriend', 'father', 'felt', 'gave', 'poor', 'performance', 'least', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'live', 'up', 'good', 'performances', 'not', 'bad', 'se', 'was', 'unexpected', 'cameo', 'kind', 'felt', 'place', 'went', 'film', 'knowing', 'who', 'was', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'viewer', 'go', 'such', 'knowledge', 'terms', 'technical', 'quality', 'cinematography', 'was', 'decent', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'visual', 'effects', 'were', 'also', 'passable', 'little', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'however', 'did', 'score', 'incidental', 'music', 'used', 'accentuated', 'material', 'quite', 'nicely', 'helped', 'punctuate', 'emotional', 'moments', 'film', 'also', 'liked', 'song', 'Miracle', 'played', 'closing', 'credits', 'Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Akiva', 'Goldsman', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'greatest', 'record', 'writer', 'also', 'wrote', 'produced', 'film', 'magical', 'realism', 'was', 'something', 'fresh', 'antidote', 'lots', 'movies', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'realistic', 'story', 'was', 'something', 'easy', 'get', 'even', 'did', 'resort', 'cliche', 'times', 'shortcomings', 'something', 'can', 'recommend', 'only', 'hard', 'enough', 'stand', 'out']",Winter's Tale

I will watch it many times not because I simply enjoyed it or for sheer entertainment but because it made me feel connected to people and all of life.",5,"Magical, Fantastical Winter's Tale",1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,886,"['Allegory', 'defined', 'expression', 'means', 'symbolic', 'fictional', 'figures', 'actions', 'truths', 'generalizations', 'human', 'existence', 'Winter', 'Tale', 'magical', 'fantastical', 'allegory', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'humanity', 'greatest', 'weapon', 'weapon', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'basically', 'good', 'like', 'movies', 'are', 'moving', 'like', 'movies', 'actors', 'bring', 'characters', 'fully', 'life', 'like', 'movies', 'attempt', 'inspire', 'rather', 'assault', 'eyes', 'ears', 'frenetic', 'action', 'earsplitting', 'sound', 'like', 'movies', 'treasure', 'soaring', 'imagination', 'mindless', 'summer', 'blockbusters', 'like', 'movies', 'will', 'remember', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'again', 'will', 'watch', 'many', 'times', 'not', 'simply', 'enjoyed', 'sheer', 'entertainment', 'made', 'feel', 'connected', 'people', 'life']",Winter's Tale

I actually teared up in the end.  Ok, you will like this one if you enjoy romance movies.  If not, you may not...just saying.  I do think this one is great to curl up with your sweetie and watch.  I totally recommend this one...the trailer and write-ups do not give it justice.  I went ahead and bought the movie rather than renting it....glad I did!!  Will be watching with my sweetie soon...awesome!!
