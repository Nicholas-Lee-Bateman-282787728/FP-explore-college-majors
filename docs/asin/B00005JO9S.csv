The truth is, if you look beyond the character Rhoda was playing, she was a stunningly beautiful woman! She had gorgeous features, not to mention loads of talent and star quality. That's why I was so happy when Valerie Harper was given her own show (Rhoda) and was shown to be loveable afterall, marrying Joe.It's important to note that the show was a huge hit, lasting 4.5 seasons. It was nominated for multiple Emmies every year, including best comedy and best leading actress (Valerie Harper). Valerie Harper won an Emmy and a Golden Globe the first season for best leading performance in a comedy series.This really needs to be released on DVD.",5,Rhoda was prettier than Mary,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",2006,794,"['was', 'always', 'extremely', 'annoyed', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'show', 'whenever', 'portrayed', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'Rhoda', 'more', 'dowdy', 'unlovable', 'Mary', 'truth', 'look', 'character', 'Rhoda', 'was', 'playing', 'was', 'stunningly', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'had', 'gorgeous', 'features', 'not', 'mention', 'loads', 'talent', 'star', 'quality', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'was', 'given', 'own', 'show', 'Rhoda', 'was', 'shown', 'be', 'loveable', 'afterall', 'marrying', 'Joe.It', 'important', 'note', 'show', 'was', 'huge', 'hit', 'lasting', '4.5', 'seasons', 'was', 'nominated', 'multiple', 'Emmies', 'year', 'including', 'best', 'comedy', 'best', 'leading', 'actress', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'first', 'season', 'best', 'leading', 'performance', 'comedy', 'series.This', 'really', 'be', 'released', 'DVD']",Rhoda

I remember seeing re-runs periodically of RHODA on the tv set. I remember Joe, Rhoda's husband(who personally I liked alot) and her sistes, Barbara (who I LOVED!!). It's about time that they brought this out on dvd. And by the way where is PHYLLIS SEASON ONE and TWO? I just hope they don't take forever bringing out the rest of the seasons like they have with the rest of MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW. One thing the studios have not registered yet, is that if the prices are more reasonable than more people will go out and buy the seasons, especially in our present economical status.I am too young to have seen this show on tv. But I will definitely be in line to buy it, when it does make an appearance.",5,ARE SERIOUS???

It is so past time to bring this show to DVD as well as to complete season's 5-7 of the Mary Tyler Moore Show!  For all of you who want to compare Mary to Rhoda, just stop being haters!  Mary and Rhoda were best frineds and loved each other like sisters.  They supported each other and complimented each other.  I for one love both of those shows and ask that Fox bring these classics to light and soon.Respectfully,sm,Seattle, WA",5,"C'mon Fox, please bring on the show",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",2007,479,"['OK', 'Fox', 'home', 'video', 'have', 'chime', 'so', 'past', 'time', 'bring', 'show', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'complete', 'season', '5-7', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'who', 'want', 'compare', 'Mary', 'Rhoda', 'just', 'stop', 'being', 'haters', 'Mary', 'Rhoda', 'were', 'best', 'frineds', 'loved', 'other', 'sisters', 'supported', 'other', 'complimented', 'other', 'one', 'love', 'shows', 'ask', 'Fox', 'bring', 'classics', 'light', 'soon.Respectfully', 'sm', 'Seattle', 'WA']",Rhoda

Rhoda was so much more funnier, prettier, and well deserving of her own show!!!Although I watched this show in re-runs ( it's original run was before my time), I really enjoyed Rhoda living the single life in New York during the Sensational Seventies!!! Valerie Harper JUST PLAIN ROCKED AS RHODA! She had a great relationship with her sister Brenda, was time enough for her pain in the butt mother ( played by the very funny Nancy Walker), she had a really cool apartment, and I just loved those fabulous scarfs she wore on her head. Very Chic!!!The 1970's was such a fantastic era for some of the best sitcoms ever created and Rhoda was among them!!! The story lines were well written and the dialogue was really funny, unlike the pathetic sitcoms currently wasting valuable network airtime today!!! I don't even bother to check the tv guide anymore, I'd rather watch Nick at Night or TV Land instead!!!Well bad tv is an entirely different and depressing subject so I'll just say my prayers and hope the powers at be are listening and RELEASE RHODA ON DVD PRONTO!!!",5,I WANNA BE RHODA!!!!!,1115424000,"05 7, 2005",2005,1153,"['Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'nice', 'character', 'waaaaaay', 'overrated', 'Rhoda', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'funnier', 'prettier', 'well', 'deserving', 'own', 'show', 'watched', 'show', 're-runs', 'original', 'run', 'was', 'time', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'Rhoda', 'living', 'single', 'life', 'New', 'York', 'Sensational', 'Seventies', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'JUST', 'PLAIN', 'ROCKED', 'RHODA', 'had', 'great', 'relationship', 'sister', 'Brenda', 'was', 'time', 'enough', 'pain', 'butt', 'mother', 'played', 'very', 'funny', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'had', 'really', 'cool', 'apartment', 'just', 'loved', 'fabulous', 'scarfs', 'wore', 'head', 'Very', 'Chic', '1970', 'was', 'such', 'fantastic', 'era', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'created', 'Rhoda', 'was', 'story', 'lines', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'dialogue', 'was', 'really', 'funny', 'pathetic', 'sitcoms', 'currently', 'wasting', 'valuable', 'network', 'airtime', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'check', 'tv', 'guide', 'anymore', ""'d"", 'rather', 'watch', 'Nick', 'Night', 'TV', 'Land', 'instead', 'Well', 'bad', 'tv', 'entirely', 'different', 'depressing', 'subject', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'prayers', 'hope', 'powers', 'be', 'are', 'listening', 'RELEASE', 'RHODA', 'ON', 'DVD', 'PRONTO']",Rhoda
