1167845,A1P3DNRGZYI4IA,B001AR0D54,Bob A,"[0, 0]","First up, I confess to being a fan of the westerd genre, particulary those from the 50s and 60s. That said, I enjoyed Lone Rider. It is most definitely not a revionist western. Modern, certainly but with a respect to the golden age. The white hat/black hat theme is continued here. As are most westerns this one is about the baddies getting their comeuppance at the hands of a reluctant hero, in this caseLou Diampnd Phillips. He carries the part well, as he usually does. Everything you could wish for is here, horse chases, shootouts, robbery and naturally murder. I almost forgot, two lovely female leads. The location shooting is filmed beautifully. I recommend this one to all lovers of good westerns. Enjoy!",4,Westerns revisited,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",2012,713,"['First', 'up', 'confess', 'being', 'fan', 'westerd', 'genre', 'particulary', '50s', '60s', 'said', 'enjoyed', 'Lone', 'Rider', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'revionist', 'western', 'Modern', 'certainly', 'respect', 'golden', 'age', 'white', 'hat/black', 'hat', 'theme', 'continued', 'here', 'are', 'most', 'westerns', 'one', 'baddies', 'getting', 'comeuppance', 'hands', 'reluctant', 'hero', 'caseLou', 'Diampnd', 'Phillips', 'part', 'well', 'usually', 'Everything', 'could', 'wish', 'here', 'horse', 'chases', 'shootouts', 'robbery', 'naturally', 'murder', 'almost', 'forgot', 'two', 'lovely', 'female', 'leads', 'location', 'shooting', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'recommend', 'one', 'lovers', 'good', 'westerns', 'Enjoy']",Lone Rider

1167851,A1QYHMXSARAHO4,B001AR0D54,Plank Spanker,"[4, 4]","This is a made for television western that is on par with many.....70's or 80's style television westerns.  While not deplorable, it is far from what I was looking for, or expected given the high reviews here.  There are some good performances.  And some not so good.  The story-line is interesting but not overly so.  It does get better as the movie progresses.Lou diamond Phillips does a good job in his role as Bobby Hattaway, decorated calvaryman.  He retires and returns home to find his childhood friend Stu (Vincent Spano good performance) has turned into the classic greedy, corrupt, and power hungry monster without any conscience that is so common for this genre.  As this becomes more evident throughout the film, conflict between the two escalates culminating in the showdown that is always necessary.  Tom Schanley's character Mike Butler, an army bud of Bobby's, adds some needed color and turns in a very good performance, though small as it is.  Timothy Bottoms as the sheriff gives a good performance as well.Anyway, to me, this was not as good as is implied here, but better than the more critical reviews.  It's worth watching and owning, cheap, say $5 including shipping and should be rated about 3.5 stars.  If you ignore the high praises sung here, and do not expect a stellar western, and view it from that perspective, you will most likely enjoy this and watch it very infrequently as a change of pace.
