He was 5'11"" tall, about 175 pounds, had long hair and a manly beard.  All of this information is right there in the most excellent photograph given to us by Jesus at the moment of His resurrection. He was like, hovering or something inbetween the folded sheet (shroud) Wow, man... watching this DVD almost takes you back in time to the moment Jesus rose from the dead! Outstanding.  Just think, one day that is going to happen to us! God is truly awesome.  As I watched this DVD I couldn't help but think how awesome God is and how He used some fantastic method beyond our current comprehension of putting the image of our Lord on this cloth.  Jesus had type AB blood!  I'm sure that is significant in some way too, man.  I'm not sure.. but that is like a type of blood that can receive all bloods or something.. and that must be saying something but I don't know what exactly... will have to ponder that one.  Oh and what a cool medallion Jesus had around his neck!  WOW!  I wept when I saw that...  Oh the love of God comes through in this production.

1050501,A35LQUG2LMLYV8,B000MTEFNM,----john J. Butera,"[10, 12]","I highly recommend this DVD as my wife and I never grow tired of watching this documentary. It is full of science and facts that will break the foundation of even the most ardent skeptic. I find the evidence for the invisible weave fascinating and has now been verified. The Shroud is a first century cloth. The Shroud contains various flora images, probably formed by coronal discharge, that are exclusive to Jerusalem and to the spring time praticularly. The DVD has extensive interviews and destroys many old held theories such as C-14 dating and that the image is painted. Experts in their fields prove the authenticity of this relic and most fascinating is the Holographic Imagery.Dr. Soons took copies on 1930's negatives to a holographic laboratory and though they were quite skeptical were able to produce 3D images,this in itself is astounding as no other 2D object can produce 3D images...NO OTHER 2D OBJECT!!! No the Shroud is completely unique and this DVD does an excellent job of marrying cutting edge science with a 2000 year old image on a cloth to prove the fact Jesus Christ rose from the dead. This is GOD's finger print of what is yet to come for us and proof for an age of science that demands facts. The Hologram also brought out incredible unseen before details about the Shroud including a plaque on the neck of Christ, Dr. Soons recently said in a lecture the plaque read The Lamb and not Father as the DVD represents.There is much more but I have made my point get this DVD and be greatly blessed and strengthened in your faith that your LORD did rise from the dead and Nothing is Impossible with GOD....JB",5,Perfect Title to an Excellent DVD,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",2008,1632,"['highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'wife', 'never', 'grow', 'tired', 'watching', 'documentary', 'full', 'science', 'will', 'break', 'foundation', 'even', 'most', 'ardent', 'skeptic', 'find', 'evidence', 'invisible', 'weave', 'fascinating', 'now', 'been', 'verified', 'Shroud', 'first', 'century', 'cloth', 'Shroud', 'various', 'flora', 'images', 'probably', 'formed', 'coronal', 'discharge', 'are', 'exclusive', 'Jerusalem', 'spring', 'time', 'praticularly', 'DVD', 'extensive', 'interviews', 'many', 'old', 'held', 'theories', 'such', 'C-14', 'dating', 'image', 'painted', 'Experts', 'fields', 'authenticity', 'relic', 'most', 'fascinating', 'Holographic', 'Imagery.Dr', 'Soons', 'took', 'copies', '1930', 'negatives', 'holographic', 'laboratory', 'were', 'quite', 'skeptical', 'were', 'able', 'produce', '3D', 'images', 'astounding', 'other', '2D', 'object', 'can', 'produce', '3D', 'images', 'NO', 'OTHER', '2D', 'OBJECT', 'No', 'Shroud', 'completely', 'unique', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'job', 'marrying', 'cutting', 'edge', 'science', '2000', 'year', 'old', 'image', 'cloth', 'prove', 'fact', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'rose', 'dead', 'GOD', 'finger', 'print', 'what', 'yet', 'come', 'proof', 'age', 'science', 'facts', 'Hologram', 'also', 'brought', 'out', 'incredible', 'unseen', 'details', 'Shroud', 'including', 'plaque', 'neck', 'Christ', 'Dr.', 'Soons', 'recently', 'said', 'lecture', 'plaque', 'read', 'Lamb', 'not', 'Father', 'DVD', 'much', 'more', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'get', 'DVD', 'be', 'greatly', 'blessed', 'strengthened', 'faith', 'LORD', 'did', 'rise', 'dead', 'Nothing', 'Impossible', 'GOD', '.JB']",The Fabric of Time

1050505,A386NVAVQV5WUO,B000MTEFNM,"Richard D. Cappetto ""RickDC""","[3, 4]","In the Fabric of Time DVD we go over some of the (brief) history of The Shroud of Turin; which some claim to be the burial cloth of Jesus: which has been surrounded in controversy; Is it authentic evidence of the resurrection of the Christ or some kind of elaborate fake. Back in the 1970's the Vatican let a team of scientists study the shroud, including cutting some small sample form it, the scientific team put in over 170,000 hours of research on the project and concluded that they did not know how it was made but that it was from Israel and from the time of Christ. In the 80's a carbon test was done and dated the shroud to the middle ages, and it seemed like all the 170,000 hours of research was just tossed out. But that carbon testing has been debunked, because of a few things, one was that the shroud was singed in a fire, and they dated the repair work. that has been proven to be a fact, the evidence shows that the fibers dated were not the original. Also you probably cannot date the shroud accurately because of the fire for one, and because it has a layer of insect residue upon it. So the Shroud is proven to be from the first century and the image is not explainable up to the 1990's. Also forensically evidence shows that the person on the shroud is 5' 11"" around 175 and was scourged, beaten and crucified. Also the blood patterns on the Shroud match with he other head cloth the catholic Church has in Spain, from Christ death and resurrection. In the last 18 years a new theory have come up as to the origin of the shroud, and it deal's with radiation, but we have nothing that can do that, so it cannot be tested. This newest theory has a twist and its is in the DVD, that the shroud was formed by a Quantum singularity. the same power that created the universe and they make a strong theoretical case. Really interestingly stuff. Is this 100% proof of Christ's resurrection, No; that is a matter I accept by faith but this is evidence that can point you in the right direction, and that direction is to Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ!",5,Proof of the Christ's Resurrection!!!!!!!,1241049600,"04 30, 2009",2009,2062,"['Fabric', 'Time', 'DVD', 'go', 'brief', 'history', 'Shroud', 'Turin', 'claim', 'be', 'burial', 'cloth', 'Jesus', 'been', 'surrounded', 'controversy', 'authentic', 'evidence', 'resurrection', 'Christ', 'kind', 'elaborate', 'fake', 'Back', '1970', 'Vatican', 'let', 'team', 'scientists', 'study', 'shroud', 'including', 'cutting', 'small', 'sample', 'form', 'scientific', 'team', 'put', '170,000', 'hours', 'research', 'project', 'concluded', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'was', 'made', 'was', 'Israel', 'time', 'Christ', '80', 'carbon', 'test', 'was', 'done', 'dated', 'shroud', 'middle', 'ages', 'seemed', '170,000', 'hours', 'research', 'was', 'just', 'tossed', 'out', 'carbon', 'testing', 'been', 'debunked', 'few', 'things', 'one', 'was', 'shroud', 'was', 'singed', 'fire', 'dated', 'repair', 'work', 'been', 'proven', 'be', 'fact', 'evidence', 'fibers', 'dated', 'were', 'not', 'original', 'Also', 'probably', 'can', 'not', 'date', 'shroud', 'accurately', 'fire', 'one', 'layer', 'insect', 'residue', 'Shroud', 'proven', 'be', 'first', 'century', 'image', 'not', 'explainable', 'up', '1990', 'Also', 'forensically', 'evidence', 'shows', 'person', 'shroud', '5', '11', '175', 'was', 'scourged', 'beaten', 'crucified', 'Also', 'blood', 'patterns', 'Shroud', 'match', 'other', 'head', 'cloth', 'catholic', 'Church', 'Spain', 'Christ', 'death', 'resurrection', 'last', '18', 'years', 'new', 'theory', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'origin', 'shroud', 'deal', 'radiation', 'have', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tested', 'newest', 'theory', 'twist', 'DVD', 'shroud', 'was', 'formed', 'Quantum', 'singularity', 'same', 'power', 'created', 'universe', 'make', 'strong', 'theoretical', 'case', 'Really', 'interestingly', 'stuff', '100', '%', 'proof', 'Christ', 'resurrection', 'No', 'matter', 'accept', 'faith', 'evidence', 'can', 'point', 'right', 'direction', 'direction', 'Jesus', 'Nazareth', 'Christ']",The Fabric of Time

A better buy with much more info is Mark Antonacci's excellent book from 2000 - ""The Resurrection of the Shroud.""  This  DVD is constantly promising to reveal the very secrets of the Universe by tying quantum theory into the Shroud....and never really does! I couldn't believe how abruptly the DVD ended!  We still do not know if the basic premise of the DVD (that the image is holographic) is true or not.  And astronaut Edgar Mitchell and physicist Alan Wolfe are tossed into the mix - not as Shroud proponants (which they NEVER even mention in their segments) but simply because they make the roster of interviewees more impressive.  The ONLY thing truly new here is that the samples taken for the Carbon-14 dating were perhaps taken from a mended portion of the cloth: THIS, if truly true, is what the documentary SHOULD have focussed on at greater length....and not the dangling of carrots of ultimate answers before us to lead us, ultmately, nowhere!
