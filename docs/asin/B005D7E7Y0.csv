1455000,A1DB4U8ISVULVE,B005D7E7Y0,Bill Smith,"[0, 14]","The biggest problem I have with Bonanza is that it simply is not a very accurate potrayal of the West. First of all, Lorne Greene is only a few years older than some of his supposed sons like Pernell Roberts. Second, Ben Cartwright had these sons with 3 different wives, all different ethnicities (English, Swedish and French Creole). What, all three wives died in childbirth? wtf? And how is some dude living out on the Ponderosa in Nevada back in the 1860s finding such a variety of different ethnic women to fornicate with? The only possible conclusion is that Ben was a frequent visitor of the brothels in Virginia City and enjoyed bedding down the ladies of the night. Yet the show never really explains all this, or delves into the history. Obviously Ben had trouble keeping his 6 shooter holstered, which resulted in multiple pregnancies for the working girls of the local town. Then, comically, these sons seem to never get laid at all. You'd think Dad would have taught them something about getting some tail in town. But no, you never hear Hoss tell Little Joe that he's going into town to get laid. Nothing about broads. If you are going to make a western, at least throw in some realism. These guys lived like celibate monks while their dad was apparantly going around banging every skirt in sight, yet you hear nothing about either situation. For instance, if it was me writing the series, I would have had old Hoss traveling to Virginia City to meet up with a harlot named Scarlet's Nana only to have him get her impregnated and contract an STD from her at the same time, thus posing a real ethical and moral conundrum. Now THAT would have been an interesting show!",3,Not an accurate potrayal of the West,1377129600,"08 22, 2013",2013,1679,"['biggest', 'problem', 'have', 'Bonanza', 'simply', 'not', 'very', 'accurate', 'potrayal', 'West', 'First', 'Lorne', 'Greene', 'only', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'supposed', 'sons', 'Pernell', 'Roberts', 'Second', 'Ben', 'Cartwright', 'had', 'sons', '3', 'different', 'wives', 'different', 'ethnicities', 'English', 'Swedish', 'French', 'Creole', 'What', 'three', 'wives', 'died', 'childbirth', 'wtf', 'how', 'dude', 'living', 'out', 'Ponderosa', 'Nevada', 'back', '1860s', 'finding', 'variety', 'different', 'ethnic', 'women', 'fornicate', 'only', 'possible', 'conclusion', 'Ben', 'was', 'frequent', 'visitor', 'brothels', 'Virginia', 'City', 'enjoyed', 'bedding', 'down', 'ladies', 'night', 'show', 'never', 'really', 'history', 'Obviously', 'Ben', 'had', 'trouble', 'keeping', '6', 'shooter', 'holstered', 'resulted', 'multiple', 'pregnancies', 'working', 'girls', 'local', 'town', 'Then', 'comically', 'sons', 'seem', 'never', 'get', 'laid', ""'d"", 'think', 'Dad', 'would', 'have', 'taught', 'something', 'getting', 'tail', 'town', 'never', 'hear', 'Hoss', 'tell', 'Little', 'Joe', 'going', 'town', 'get', 'laid', 'Nothing', 'broads', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'western', 'least', 'throw', 'realism', 'guys', 'lived', 'celibate', 'monks', 'dad', 'was', 'apparantly', 'going', 'banging', 'skirt', 'sight', 'yet', 'hear', 'nothing', 'situation', 'instance', 'was', 'writing', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'old', 'Hoss', 'traveling', 'Virginia', 'City', 'meet', 'up', 'harlot', 'named', 'Scarlet', 'Nana', 'only', 'have', 'get', 'impregnated', 'contract', 'STD', 'same', 'time', 'thus', 'posing', 'real', 'ethical', 'moral', 'conundrum', 'Now', 'THAT', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'show']",Bonanza: Season 2

Carroll,"[12, 15]",I now have first season 1 & 2 and second season 1 & 2 and I've read some of the reviews that customers have written praising the picture quality. But to tell the truth I find the picture to be somewhat washed out. I had just seen the episode 'silent thunder' a week ago on TV land and when I got my set I happened to view that same episode again and it just didn't seem as clear on my DVD set as it did on cable. I thought maybe it was a defected disk but all of them were like that.

Of course I remember watching it growing up but I was really just in the room  physically while my parents were actually watching and enjoying the series in 1959/60.  I was too young to care about anything but the fast draws and would get up and go play in another room when the &#34;drama&#34; took over.  By the time it moved to Sunday nights, I was really not interested and has purposely not watched the show since in syndication out of some misplaced snobbery about it being  &#34;my parents show&#34;.  Well, now that my wife bought me a best of DVD I've found out what I've been missing.  As a result, I'm buying the series by Season.  I've S1, S2, & S3 of both volumes each and it's money well spent.  I will buy more but might probably give up when Pernell Roberts leaves, but then again, I was wrong before so I may ride with the Cartwright boys right to the end.The episodes were very well written and the guest stars ran the gamut from television actors to motion picture stars.  I loved the episode with Ida Lupino (great actress and director as well.  &#34;Have Gun Will Travel&#34; fans will know what I'm speaking about as she directed many of the episodes of that great series).
