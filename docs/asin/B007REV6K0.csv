The good thing about this was that I checked it out from the library-I truly got what I paid for.While I believe in free speech, there is also fool speech and yelling fire in a crowded theater. This film tests the limits of responsibility with this horrible, sick, vile story about a loser named Frank who fails at everything in life and is put upon by rude neighbors, ignorant co-workers, a bratty daughter, shrewish ex-wife, and an overall disgust over the crudity of 21st century popular culture. The film begins with Frank fantasizing about murdering a crying baby who disturbs his sleep. Later, he kills a teenage reality star (near her school, I might add) which attracts the attention of another bratty teenager (the girl on the cover of the DVD). The latter brat then joins Frank in a shooting spree, blasting away all who offend their standards. In one scene that was admittedly filmed before the Batman murders, Frank and the girl shoot rude patrons at a movie theater. Are you laughing yet?Not only is this film disgusting for the above reasons. ""Frank"" (who appears to be in his 50s) stays in hotel rooms with his teenage accomplice. While no sex is openly implied, the underlying sexual tension is there and this has no place in movies intended for the general public. There is also an atrocious bit of business clealry intended for laughs involving an (obviously) mentally challenged singing contestant in an American Idol type spoof. The audience wildly hoots and mocks him as he does a horrific hip hop version of the Theme from Mahogany (Do you know where you're going to) that would send Diana Ross to a hospital bed. Of course, Frank and the teenage girl take on the audience for this. I'm surprised no scenes exist in this film of people tripping up blind people.I flatly say that this movie is a work of pure sickness! It boggles my mind that there are people who find this funny in light of Colombine, 9/11, the Batman shootings, assassinations, the tragedy I mentioned at the beginning of this review, ad nauseum. What's next? Gladiators at the Colosseum? Public lynchings? The return of mentally handicapped court jesters? There are too many real life ""Franks"" out there who may be encouraged by this filth and this is one of the most inappropriate and irresponsible films since ""Birth of a Nation"" regenerated the Ku Klux Klan in 1915. Before going on his spree, ""Frank"" should have used this DVD for target practice.If you actually find this movie funny in light of current reality, you may really want to take a good look at yourself and ask yourself why.

1536865,AOMDGKZTVIE9P,B007REV6K0,Andrew Collins,"[2, 2]","Frank (Joel Murray) just does not seem to have any luck in life. A divorcee whose daughter hates him, he lives next door to obnoxious and inconsiderate neighbors. Things go from bad to worse for Frank when gets fired from his job after a nonsensical sexual harassment complaint and then is diagnosed as terminally ill with a brain tumor by his rude doctor. He spends his evenings watching TV and is disgusted with the lowbrow quality of everything he sees. He is about to commit suicide when he changes his mind and instead goes on a mission to rid America of what he sees as the most hateful people. Along the way, he forms an unlikely friendship with teenage psychopath Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr).To be sure, the film starts off quite promising. Even though Frank's predicaments are exaggerated for comedic effect, you do start to feel for him. His complaints early in the film about trash TV and the lack of kindness in society does make one stop and think and wonder if he really has a point. There are some pretty funny jokes throughout the film.However, I felt the film was far from perfect. While watching it for the first time, I felt the film was getting pretty tired about halfway through. By this point, you already know what is going to happen as Frank and Roxy run around waving guns and shooting people they dislike. After the first time, the characters' soliloquies are too in-your-face and sound far too scripted. The film overall really lacks subtlety. Another complaint is the Roxy character. I thought she was paper-thin and she does not develop at all throughout the entire movie. Unlike Frank who has a general motivation for his actions, Roxy just seems to like being violent for the sake of being violent.Many people have compared this film to 1993's Falling Down which is how it originally caught my eye. However, the similarities between the two films are only superficial. Both feature a laid-off and divorced main character who become disillusioned with the society they are forced to live in. However, Falling Down had a more gritty realism to it while God Bless America is far more over the top and violent.Also included on this DVD are numerous bonus features including an audio commentary by director Bobcat Goldthwait and the two principal actors, some interviews, and a making-of documentary.This movie was a mixed bag for me. While there is a decent message in there about its critique of modern American culture regarding lowbrow television, celebrity worship, and general rudeness, this message gets lost amongst excessive violence. It may be a violent fantasy film that I am sure will appeal to many people.",3,Misses the Mark,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,2640,"['Frank', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'just', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'luck', 'life', 'divorcee', 'daughter', 'next', 'door', 'obnoxious', 'inconsiderate', 'neighbors', 'Things', 'go', 'bad', 'worse', 'Frank', 'when', 'fired', 'job', 'nonsensical', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'complaint', 'then', 'diagnosed', 'terminally', 'brain', 'tumor', 'rude', 'doctor', 'evenings', 'watching', 'TV', 'disgusted', 'lowbrow', 'quality', 'everything', 'commit', 'suicide', 'when', 'mind', 'instead', 'mission', 'rid', 'America', 'what', 'most', 'hateful', 'people', 'way', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'teenage', 'psychopath', 'Roxy', 'Tara', 'Lynne', 'Barr', '.To', 'be', 'sure', 'film', 'quite', 'promising', 'Even', 'Frank', 'predicaments', 'are', 'exaggerated', 'comedic', 'effect', 'do', 'start', 'feel', 'complaints', 'early', 'film', 'trash', 'TV', 'lack', 'kindness', 'society', 'make', 'one', 'stop', 'think', 'wonder', 'really', 'point', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'jokes', 'film.However', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'perfect', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'getting', 'pretty', 'tired', 'halfway', 'point', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'Frank', 'Roxy', 'run', 'around', 'waving', 'guns', 'shooting', 'people', 'dislike', 'first', 'time', 'characters', 'soliloquies', 'are', 'too', 'in-your-face', 'sound', 'far', 'too', 'scripted', 'film', 'overall', 'really', 'subtlety', 'complaint', 'Roxy', 'character', 'thought', 'was', 'paper-thin', 'not', 'develop', 'entire', 'movie', 'Frank', 'who', 'general', 'motivation', 'actions', 'Roxy', 'just', 'like', 'being', 'violent', 'sake', 'being', 'violent.Many', 'people', 'have', 'compared', 'film', '1993', 'Falling', 'Down', 'how', 'originally', 'caught', 'eye', 'However', 'similarities', 'two', 'films', 'are', 'only', 'superficial', 'feature', 'laid-off', 'divorced', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'become', 'disillusioned', 'society', 'are', 'forced', 'live', 'However', 'Falling', 'Down', 'had', 'more', 'gritty', 'realism', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'far', 'more', 'top', 'violent.Also', 'included', 'DVD', 'are', 'numerous', 'bonus', 'features', 'including', 'audio', 'commentary', 'director', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'two', 'principal', 'actors', 'interviews', 'making-of', 'documentary.This', 'movie', 'was', 'mixed', 'bag', 'decent', 'message', 'critique', 'modern', 'American', 'culture', 'regarding', 'lowbrow', 'television', 'celebrity', 'worship', 'general', 'rudeness', 'message', 'lost', 'amongst', 'excessive', 'violence', 'may', 'be', 'violent', 'fantasy', 'film', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'appeal', 'many', 'people']",N/A

I just don't think it's fun to watch stuff like this after what happened in Colorado this year. There is even a scene in this movie where four people are gunned down in a theater. Sound familiar? I also disagree with the hate of pop culture in this movie. The main character hates a show (that is similiar to American Idol) so much that he wants to kill everyone who works on the show as well as its fans. Being a fan of American Idol, I really hated those scenes of the movie. I'm not going to say that this film didn't have its interesting moments though, because it does. It's just a shame that buried under the interesting moments, are moments that are depressing and vile.",2,"Evil, Yet Intriguing",1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,735,"['God', 'Bless', 'America', 'evil', 'movie', 'intriguing', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fun', 'watch', 'stuff', 'what', 'happened', 'Colorado', 'year', 'even', 'scene', 'movie', 'where', 'four', 'people', 'are', 'gunned', 'down', 'theater', 'Sound', 'familiar', 'also', 'disagree', 'hate', 'pop', 'culture', 'movie', 'main', 'character', 'show', 'similiar', 'American', 'Idol', 'so', 'much', 'kill', 'everyone', 'who', 'show', 'as', 'well', 'fans', 'Being', 'fan', 'American', 'Idol', 'really', 'hated', 'scenes', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'interesting', 'moments', 'just', 'shame', 'buried', 'interesting', 'moments', 'are', 'moments', 'are', 'depressing', 'vile']",N/A
1536874,A2R5VKE4YO966D,B007REV6K0,Charles Curtis,"[4, 10]","I guess this movie is meant to be arch hip knowing satire.  I give it two stars because I mildly appreciated how it grinds the cruelty and vapidity of American popular culture and political life in our faces.  It makes  very succinct comment on that, and the inescapable conclusion - that we have become an ignorant, cruel, shallow, greed ridden people - is worthwhile.The problem is that the satire is too rudimentary: the movie subjects us to montage of thinly veiled clones of American Idol, the Kardashians, Bill O'Reilly, so on, all unexaggerated, all just as vulgar and odious as their real life inspirations.  It's effective in eliciting proper revulsion.  The two main protagonists' reaction though, is to go on a graphic killing spree, where they become judge and executioner of all frauds and cretins.  All while blathering on and on about how repulsive everyone else is.And that, a part from the graphic violence (example: first scene of movie is a fantasy sequence in which the main character takes a crying infant, tosses him up and blows him away with a 12 gauge drenching his mother in blood - the baby cries and keeps the guy awake, and his parents are ignorant hicks, so they deserve what they get, see) is the problem. The two main characters who go on the killing spree are just as insufferable as everyone they hate and kill.They just can't shut up about how much they hate everyone, and how superior they are.  I guess that is supposed to be part of the ""satire"" - everyone's an irredeemable wretch, including our despicable antiheroes - there are only degrees of contemptability, no virtue.  Punk rockers and goths are posers, Diablo Cody is a poser, NASCAR and country music are idiotic, reality tv is idiotic, so on so on so on and on and on.. I mean, yeah.  I really dislike hipsters and rednecks, too.  They're frequently annoying.  That's why I tend to avoid them.  But I don't hate them.  I prefer just not to think about them at all, you know?Like way too much energy, too warping to my own inner life to be a hater, there, dude.I watched half of the movie, and finally just got too bored and annoyed by the unremitting pathetic wretchedness.I shut it off in the middle of an interminable soliloquy (one of many) by the girl character where she goes on and on about how everything s*cks except for - oddly enough - Alice Cooper.  He, somehow, is an exception.  Bon Jovi and Poison are all imitative losers, punk is for hipster posers, but Alice, he is the real deal, see.. An authentic artist, apparently because he is so self aware,  deliberately androgynous, knowingly kitsch and camp.  Hipsters are frauds, but the hypocrites in this movie like Alice because he's in in the joke or something.. The actress playing the role recites her screeds like she's reading them off of cue cards.  It's like taking a dental drill in the eardrum.Uh, no.  Alice Cooper is not better than Poison.  Sorry.  It's all sludge.  Anyone who thinks they are hipper than Bon Jovi fans because they prefer Alice Cooper is an idiot.They were apparently on a mission to kill the movie's Bill O'Reilly stand in.  Bill is probably my least favorite American after Glenn Beck and Rushbo, so seeing that character offed might have been briefly amusing.  The problem is that the rest of this movie is just as awful as watching Bill O'Reilly himself.  Imagine O'Reilly's show, but with him shooting his guests every so often.  Same thing, this: idiotic vulgarity with intermittent graphic violence. The idea of O'Reilly shooting his guests is (to me) admittedly somehow perversely funny.  Watching him actually do it, not so much..Another thing is that the characters go on and on about homosexuality, and how repressed and retrograde people who prefer chastity and traditional mores are.  A 50 year old man and a 17 year old girl on a serial killing spree, treating each other with all due respect, but both going on and on about how the truly hip and decent (whatever that word may mean in this movie's universe) are for sodomy.The implicit fact that if they actually got jiggy with each other would ruin this film for all but the truly utterly depraved, is really true unintended ironic satire.  He has to remain avuncular, she virginal. Otherwise, it would just be too icky, dude.  Actually, they may have gone there before the end, after I dropped off..  I don't know.We're in a pop-rocks Nietzschean world, where the likes of Ayn Rand is held to be a philosopher, Rue Paul an entertainer, George Bush a statesman, and Larry Flynt an artist.  Hah. Satire and poetry are dead.Anyway, that, to me, sums this rancid culture up.  And this film.  Bullocks, all of it.  This is depraved and boring.  Not funny, not clever, certainly not good satire.  I'm already cynical and judgmental enough without exposing myself to crap like this.Watch only if you think Alice Cooper is a genius.",2,"Pure, Unadulterated, Enervating, Midnumbing

This movie was pretty much what you'd expect from Hollywood -- from the ""super funny"" ironic title to the nothing like the movie trailer it's exactly what you'd expect from someone that's spent their entire adult life doing films and what their vision of America is.You'll like this movie if;1) You're a simpleton2) If Fox News makes you so mad you actually want to kill people3) If you're able to ignore hundreds of contradictions in a single movie4) If in the year 2012 you're still giving anti-Bush speeches to your remaining friends5) If you hate America and want to move to France (as said in the movie - not my words)6) If you believe the Tea Party only exists to harass dying people (for example a news clip in the movie is captioned ""Tea Party Members assault elderly Parkinson's sufferer"")7) You're an older gentleman that really really wants to have sex with a teenage girlOK with that said I did give the movie 2 stars and not 1 since it's still enjoyable to watch at times. We can all get behind shooting up a theater of annoying people talking on the phone, we can all accept killing someone for double parking in a full parking lot -- those are a given. Would it be fun to shoot-up the audience at American Idol? Perhaps.However what this movie is supposed to be targeting are the extremes in society and in that case it fails miserably. According to this film the only extremes come from the right - with the hilarious exception of gun control (I totally didn't see that one coming guys - good job!). It completely ruins the movie - either leave the politics out, attack both sides or just state you're creating a movie with an agenda (and not this is important since the politics run throughout the entire movie so you won't be able to escape them).",2,Hate America?

You even got to see the kid from ""Spy Kids"" (Daryl Sabara) be a total pervert and take on autoerotic asphyxiation. It was like you almost felt guilty for liking something so twisted. That dark comedy made me a fan of Mr. Goldthwait's for life. I even marked out when he was on a recent episode of ""Adventure Time"". Three years later and Bobcat has another dark, twisted comedy up his sleeve. ""God Bless America"" begins with a baby being shot point blank with a shotgun in its opening moments and you just know Bobcat has returned to deliver another cinematic journey that's just as unsettling and hilarious as his previous effort.Frank (Joel Murray) suffers from chronic migraines. He's utterly disgusted with what the world and even what humanity has evolved into. His daughter is a spoiled brat, his ex-wife refuses to take responsibility for anything, and he loses his job when a few acts of human decency on his part are mistaken as sexual harassment. When he goes to the doctor, he's diagnosed with a brain tumor and isn't given long to live. He contemplates suicide and even gets as far as putting the gun into his mouth, but instead decides to take his frustrations out on the stupidity and downright vicious behavior that currently plagues the world. His strange behavior and cruel intentions attract the 16-year old Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr), who not only supports Frank's cause but wants to help him achieve it.""God Bless America"" is a bit different than ""World's Greatest Dad"". ""World's Greatest Dad"" had this father/son relationship at its core and while it wasn't exactly the most normal relationship, it was more intimate in comparison to ""God Bless America"". ""God Bless America"" has a bigger message. It takes aim at our entire generation and is mostly spot-on about everything it has to say. It just so happens to be things people either don't want to hear or are too afraid to actually say. If anything, ""God Bless America"" has the biggest balls of any movie so far in 2012.The 9/11 bumper sticker, American Superstarz phenomenon, rude people talking or using their cell phone doing a movie, and famous individuals swerving the population's opinion about something even though they know nothing about it are just a few things ""God Bless America"" puts in its crosshairs. The truth of the matter is that if you don't relate to absolutely everything Frank or Roxy have to say, then you'll find at least one message in the film worth applauding. Does that mean people are going to pick up an AK-47 tomorrow after seeing this movie and annihilate rude people they think will be for the greater good? Probably not, but deep down if you're reading this then that thought has probably crossed your mind at some point.""God Bless America"" is most reminiscent of ""Super"" and even though Frank and Roxy's friendship is never taken to the level that Frank (Rainn Wilson) and Libby's (Ellen Page) gets to, the two dark comedies are more similar than you may think; both contain twisted subject matter, both Franks take matters into their own hands after something drastic happens to them, and the older man/younger girl relationship are just a few examples.""God Bless America"" is a really sensational comedy that not everyone is going to enjoy. It jumps over boundaries that many expect should never even think of being crossed.

Outside, to get our attention, it portrays a pair of vigilantes with guns blazing in all directions. Inside, its message is ""Please try to be NICER to each other!""Frank (Joel Murray)--divorced, fired from his job, and perhaps suffering from a massive inoperable brain tumor--has long been disgusted with the rampant selfishness, thoughtlessness, and downright MEANNESS of a large segment of America, a character defect that virtually all viewers will easily recognize in dozens of this movie's satirical scenes. While preparing to commit suicide, Frank decides to execute one mean celebrity who lives near him before he dies.During this somewhat bumbling first execution, Frank is observed by a teenage girl calling herself Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr), who persuades him to forgo suicide and team up with her on a cross-country shooting spree that will include minor meanies (like those who use cell-phones in movie theaters and who deliberately take TWO parking places) and major meanies (an organized bigot-group resembling the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, fake-news broadcasters who deliberately divide America with lies, and cruel TV talent-show judges who mock contestants to get laughs).Since few of us are  going to have identical levels of disgust or anger toward any or all of the ""targets,"" be prepared to have mixed feelings about many parts of this film ...

1536886,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B007REV6K0,Douglas King,"[1, 3]","This is the third film I've seen by Bobcat Golthwait (after ""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" and ""World's Greatest Dad""), and he's really emerged as an interesting filmmaker. So far, all his films seem to have a similar formula: take an outrageous premise, and then use it to explore the human condition in surprisingly nuanced ways.Frank (Joel Murray, in a sensitive leading performance) has had it. His cold ex-wife has left him for a younger man, and is spoiling their bratty daughter. He's fired from him job for sexual harassment, when all he did was send flowers to a co-worker to cheer her up. And finally, his horrifically indifferent doctor diagnoses him with a terminal brain tumor. Frank is also disgusted with current American culture. He sits in his living room, flipping channels, and is horrified by how dumbed down and mean-spirited everything is. Finally, while watching a show that features a monstrous, entitled girl planning a garish Sweet 16 party, Frank snaps, and decides to track the girl down and murder her.While committing the murder, Frank meets teenage Roxy, who is thrilled and impressed by the execution. Roxy tracks Frank down at this motel room, right before his planned suicide, and encourages him to turn the incident from a final act of rage to the beginning of a murder spree meant to rid the world of the worst of society. Despite their age difference, Frank and Roxy bond. They're both angry, lonely and disturbed. Their relationship explores the similarities between adolescent disillusionment and middle-aged disillusionment, and discovers they're really not so different. Roxy approaches their crime spree with more excitement and enthusiasm, perhaps, than world-weary Frank, who approaches the whole thing from the perspective of a has-been who has nothing left to lose. But really, they're kindred spirits.The two then go on a quest to rid society of many of its biggest cultural tumors, and various characters serve as stand-ins for real life institutions such as American Idol, Fox News, and the Westboro Baptist Church. Frank and Roxy also occasionally execute everyday people who are just plain rude and nasty, including people who talk on the phone in the movie theatre, or people who take up two spaces with their car.It's all very entertaining and darkly funny. Yet often throughout the film, when Frank is glued to the TV in disgust, I find myself asking a question: why can't he just turn it off? Instead of all his reactive ranting, why can't he just go for a hike, or read a book, or listen to an album by someone who actually has talent? So as much as the film justifiably criticizes much of the cultural wasteland, it doesn't let the viewer off the hook either. Why do we continue to watch awful TV shows and movies, listen to awful music, and give attention to vapid, narcissistic people? Why don't we only support artists and products that are worth supporting? And if we're finding our culture has become petty and cruel, why don't we counteract it by treating the people around us with kindness and respect?",4,Responsibility,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,3055,"['third', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Bobcat', 'Golthwait', 'Sleeping', 'Dogs', 'Lie', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Dad', 'really', 'emerged', 'interesting', 'filmmaker', 'So', 'far', 'films', 'seem', 'have', 'similar', 'formula', 'take', 'outrageous', 'premise', 'then', 'use', 'explore', 'human', 'condition', 'surprisingly', 'nuanced', 'ways.Frank', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'sensitive', 'leading', 'performance', 'had', 'cold', 'ex-wife', 'left', 'younger', 'man', 'spoiling', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'fired', 'job', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'when', 'did', 'was', 'send', 'flowers', 'co-worker', 'cheer', 'up', 'finally', 'horrifically', 'indifferent', 'doctor', 'terminal', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Frank', 'also', 'disgusted', 'current', 'American', 'culture', 'living', 'room', 'flipping', 'channels', 'horrified', 'how', 'dumbed', 'down', 'mean-spirited', 'everything', 'Finally', 'watching', 'show', 'monstrous', 'entitled', 'girl', 'planning', 'garish', 'Sweet', '16', 'party', 'Frank', 'decides', 'track', 'girl', 'down', 'murder', 'her.While', 'committing', 'murder', 'Frank', 'teenage', 'Roxy', 'who', 'thrilled', 'impressed', 'execution', 'Roxy', 'tracks', 'Frank', 'down', 'motel', 'room', 'right', 'planned', 'suicide', 'turn', 'incident', 'final', 'act', 'rage', 'beginning', 'murder', 'spree', 'meant', 'rid', 'world', 'worst', 'society', 'age', 'difference', 'Frank', 'Roxy', 'bond', ""'re"", 'angry', 'lonely', 'disturbed', 'relationship', 'similarities', 'adolescent', 'disillusionment', 'middle-aged', 'disillusionment', 'discovers', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'so', 'different', 'Roxy', 'crime', 'spree', 'more', 'excitement', 'enthusiasm', 'perhaps', 'world-weary', 'Frank', 'who', 'whole', 'thing', 'perspective', 'has-been', 'who', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'really', ""'re"", 'kindred', 'spirits.The', 'two', 'then', 'go', 'quest', 'rid', 'society', 'many', 'biggest', 'cultural', 'tumors', 'various', 'characters', 'serve', 'stand-ins', 'real', 'life', 'institutions', 'such', 'American', 'Idol', 'Fox', 'News', 'Westboro', 'Baptist', 'Church', 'Frank', 'Roxy', 'also', 'occasionally', 'execute', 'everyday', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'rude', 'nasty', 'including', 'people', 'who', 'talk', 'phone', 'movie', 'theatre', 'people', 'who', 'take', 'up', 'two', 'spaces', 'car.It', 'very', 'entertaining', 'darkly', 'funny', 'often', 'film', 'when', 'Frank', 'glued', 'TV', 'disgust', 'find', 'asking', 'question', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'turn', 'off', 'Instead', 'reactive', 'ranting', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'hike', 'read', 'book', 'listen', 'album', 'someone', 'who', 'actually', 'talent', 'So', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'justifiably', 'much', 'cultural', 'wasteland', ""n't"", 'let', 'viewer', 'hook', 'Why', 'do', 'continue', 'watch', 'awful', 'TV', 'shows', 'movies', 'listen', 'awful', 'music', 'give', 'attention', 'vapid', 'narcissistic', 'people', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'only', 'support', 'artists', 'products', 'are', 'worth', 'supporting', ""'re"", 'finding', 'culture', 'become', 'petty', 'cruel', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'counteract', 'treating', 'people', 'kindness', 'respect']",N/A

Good for him, since setting chairs on fire really had a limited shelf life as a career.  However, if GOD BLESS AMERICA is any indication, li'l Bobby's got a lot of issues.  Not so much ""issues"" as ""hates,"" really.  For example, it's clear he hates managers.  And doctors.  And guns.  And commercials.  And work.  And people who don't turn off their cell phones during movies.  And reality television.  And celebrities.  And random violence.  And Republicans.  And organized religion.  And cancer.  And precocious teenagers.  And the Tea Party.  And dime-store clothing.  And maybe even sports cars.  And, truth be told, he probably harbors a whole host of other hates.  In fact, one could argue that he chocks his signature film so full of hate one wonders how the thing actually got edited to a reasonable length.  Thank goodness he speaks and thinks in sound bytes otherwise this would've been a miniseries.Unlike some others critics, I'm comfortable being perfectly fair (Bobcat and I probably come from different ideologies) by stating that the film mostly skirts with harmlessness.  (""Skirts"" with it, people.)  I think it's pretty obvious that, on one hand, Bobcat doesn't want any viewers to take any of these characters any more serious than they would any other fictional character.  He imbues them with lines that sound far too rich, far too rehearsed, and far too precious to be anything other than dialogue from a movie script - a satire rich in commentary but packed to the gills with too many influences to be anything more than the haphazard and scatterbrained observations of someone who's either (A) REALLY impressed with how he thinks or (b) watched WAY too much TV for one lifetime.  If there's a consistent message here, it's that society's ongoing fascination with celebrity will no doubt be the death of us all ... or, at least, anyone who works in reality television.For the most part, AMERICA sticks to the usual suspects, mining territory that's all-too-often been explored thematically in a host of other films.  FALLING DOWN comes to mind.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS does, too.  Granted, AMERICA made some news in its original run by taking some lazy, factually erroneous, and unnecessary slights at the recent Tea Party, but those barbs are such a small, small piece of the bigger portrait he's painting here that I'm surprised some websites are still getting mileage out of it.  In fact, I'd strongly suggest that most members of the Tea Party would probably agree with 50-60% of the points Bobcat scores in the rest of the film, should they take the time to sit and view it.  When it does plumb some more treacherous depths - it flirts with the topic of inappropriate feelings between an adult and his child accomplice - it's clearly in full-comic-mode (at least, so far as I'm concerned).  Do the jokes work?  Probably as well as Bobcat intended.Still, with a ""controversial"" film exploring plenty of controversies themselves, I would've liked a bit more substance.  The leads (Joel Murray as the down-on-his-luck Frank, and Tara Lynne Barr as his too-plucky-for-her-own-good teen accomplice, Roxy) do the best they can with the material they were given, but - and I offer this SOLELY as a constructive criticism - I can't help but wonder if a more accomplished director could've pushed them in some different directions.  Sometimes the writer is too close to the material to see some of the alternatives available to the talent in front of the cameras.  Perhaps even having a director who shares his vision - maybe a Jason Reitman or even Diablo Cody herself - could've honed the finished product to the point where it didn't say so much about so many things and, instead, really pounded home the central message about celebrity in America.  Not quite a hit but not a miss either, AMERICA tracks right down the middle.GOD BLESS AMERICA was produced by Darko Entertainment and Jerkschool Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment.  The disc looks and sounds just fine.  To its credit, the DVD release is chocked full of special features, including deleted scenes, some making of featurettes, and an audio commentary with the Bobcat and his two leading stars.  It's an impressive package that will give you some insight into the entire production process.RECOMMENDED.  As I said, put politics aside, folks, and you'll probably find plenty to enjoy in the `satirific' GOD BLESS AMERICA.  Thematically, it has WAY too much going on for my tastes, though I'm more than aware others find it pitch perfect.  Different strokes for different folks.  Where some see a perfect bulls-eye, I see a just-above-average flick with some real untapped potential.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Magnolia Home Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener copy of GOD BLESS AMERICA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,"Unfairly Drubbed for Its Politics, GOD BLESS AMERICA

1536891,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B007REV6K0,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[0, 2]","During the second time I watched ""God Bless America"" this year, somebody in the place I was viewing it was offended, and requested me to turn it off. This person was not watching it, but heard some of the dialogue streaming in from the other room. The dialogue itself wasn't nasty, or disgusting in any way. Rather, it was the protagonist's terse tirade on everything that he felt is wrong with today's society, name-dropping different types of television and radio. Now, out of respect for this person, who is a friend, I turned off the film. It is then that I realized that Bobcat Goldthwait has created a truly divisive movie, one that digs a knife into the jugular of American society and proceeds to twist it. In doing this, he has crafted one of the most intelligent pieces of social satire you're ever going to see.Everything kicks off on what may be the worst day of Frank Murdoch's life. He is fired from his job of eleven years for a false charge of sexual harassment, he's diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor, and his bratty daughter has no interest in seeing him after his divorce. Piled on top of his general discontent with society at large, and his deep-seated hatred of how mean America has become, it pushes him over the edge. He almost offs himself, but before he commits the act, he sees a spoiled 16 year-old on a reality show making the life of everybody around her a living hell. He hunts her down and kills her, but is caught in the act by a fellow student of the girl named Roxy. Instead of turning him in, she sees the validity in his action, and persuades him to let her team up to begin a crusade of taking down every demographic they think deserve to die.While this movie is indeed a bloodbath, it is also a sharp commentary on society at large. Juxtaposing the tight action sequences are lengthy dialogues and monologues that both question and lambaste American culture. The focus is primarily on how mean people have become, and how today's entertainment is reliant on the harm and humiliation of people. It extols this message while at the same time being an incredibly mean and relentless picture, one that will definitely upset more than a few people. Some may view this as hypocritical, but after seeing Goldthwait's excellent 2009 film ""World's Greatest Dad"", I can't believe that he would overlook such a simple hypocrisy. In my opinion, he uses violence and cruelty to get across a message that even pacifists can be pushed to a breaking point. It imagines an instance where a demographic who generally protests with their brains instead takes to the streets and starts annihilating everybody they disagree with. It is a warning message, one that firmly speaks against intolerance and demands change. I did not agree with everything Frank and Roxy thought, but instead looked at their actions objectively. By doing this, the movie took on a whole new light, especially the second time through.Joel Murray is great as Frank, with a wry tone and earnest goal that quickly escalates into something more than he ever prepared for. His performance reminded me very much of James McCaffrey's in the ""Max Payne"" video games, right down to the pitch of his voice and demeanor. But the scene stealer in this picture is undoubtedly Tara Lynne Barr as Roxy. Everything about her performance is absolutely flawless, taking the ""hipster Lolita crossed with cynical murderer"" character and running with it. She is quick, funny and, most importantly, convincing. When she speaks, it's with a false sense of intelligence and confidence that is underscored by bitter pathos and sadness that might not have even been intentional. This is the type of performance that true stars break out from, and I wouldn't be surprised if we see more from this incredibly talented young lady in the coming years.""God Bless America"" is funny, engaging, and thrilling all at once, and not particularly in that order. It had me thinking about it ages after I saw it in theaters, and it was even better when I watched it for the second time over the weekend. It takes the satire that Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy"" was going for and hones it into something more poignant and brutal, like ""Postal"" but with a brain. It will not win any awards, for it is far too divisive and harsh for most audiences. While the comedy of the situation subsides within the first half of the film, and the characters sometimes act as figureheads for the director himself instead of being fleshed out a little more, it is still an excellent timr, and worth adding to your collection.Overall: B+",4,Brutal Wake-Up Call,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,4573,"['second', 'time', 'watched', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'year', 'somebody', 'place', 'was', 'viewing', 'was', 'offended', 'requested', 'turn', 'off', 'person', 'was', 'not', 'watching', 'heard', 'dialogue', 'streaming', 'other', 'room', 'dialogue', 'was', ""n't"", 'nasty', 'disgusting', 'way', 'Rather', 'was', 'protagonist', 'terse', 'tirade', 'everything', 'felt', 'wrong', 'today', 'society', 'name-dropping', 'different', 'types', 'television', 'radio', 'Now', 'respect', 'person', 'who', 'friend', 'turned', 'off', 'film', 'then', 'realized', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'created', 'truly', 'divisive', 'movie', 'one', 'knife', 'jugular', 'American', 'society', 'proceeds', 'twist', 'doing', 'crafted', 'one', 'most', 'intelligent', 'pieces', 'social', 'satire', ""'re"", 'ever', 'going', 'see.Everything', 'kicks', 'off', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'day', 'Frank', 'Murdoch', 'life', 'fired', 'job', 'eleven', 'years', 'false', 'charge', 'sexual', 'harassment', 'diagnosed', 'inoperable', 'brain', 'tumor', 'bratty', 'daughter', 'interest', 'seeing', 'divorce', 'Piled', 'top', 'general', 'discontent', 'society', 'large', 'deep-seated', 'hatred', 'how', 'mean', 'America', 'become', 'edge', 'almost', 'act', 'spoiled', '16', 'year-old', 'reality', 'show', 'making', 'life', 'everybody', 'living', 'hell', 'down', 'caught', 'act', 'fellow', 'student', 'girl', 'named', 'Roxy', 'Instead', 'turning', 'validity', 'action', 'let', 'team', 'up', 'begin', 'crusade', 'taking', 'down', 'demographic', 'think', 'deserve', 'die.While', 'movie', 'indeed', 'bloodbath', 'also', 'sharp', 'commentary', 'society', 'large', 'Juxtaposing', 'tight', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'lengthy', 'dialogues', 'monologues', 'question', 'lambaste', 'American', 'culture', 'focus', 'primarily', 'how', 'mean', 'people', 'have', 'become', 'how', 'today', 'entertainment', 'reliant', 'harm', 'humiliation', 'people', 'message', 'same', 'time', 'being', 'incredibly', 'mean', 'relentless', 'picture', 'one', 'will', 'definitely', 'upset', 'more', 'few', 'people', 'may', 'view', 'hypocritical', 'seeing', 'Goldthwait', 'excellent', '2009', 'film', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Dad', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'would', 'overlook', 'such', 'simple', 'hypocrisy', 'opinion', 'violence', 'cruelty', 'get', 'message', 'even', 'can', 'be', 'pushed', 'breaking', 'point', 'instance', 'where', 'demographic', 'who', 'generally', 'brains', 'instead', 'streets', 'annihilating', 'everybody', 'disagree', 'warning', 'message', 'one', 'firmly', 'intolerance', 'demands', 'change', 'did', 'not', 'agree', 'everything', 'Frank', 'Roxy', 'thought', 'instead', 'looked', 'actions', 'objectively', 'doing', 'movie', 'took', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'especially', 'second', 'time', 'through.Joel', 'Murray', 'great', 'Frank', 'wry', 'tone', 'earnest', 'goal', 'quickly', 'something', 'more', 'ever', 'prepared', 'performance', 'reminded', 'very', 'much', 'James', 'McCaffrey', 'Max', 'Payne', 'video', 'games', 'right', 'down', 'pitch', 'voice', 'demeanor', 'scene', 'stealer', 'picture', 'undoubtedly', 'Tara', 'Lynne', 'Barr', 'Roxy', 'Everything', 'performance', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'taking', 'hipster', 'Lolita', 'crossed', 'cynical', 'murderer', 'character', 'running', 'quick', 'funny', 'most', 'importantly', 'convincing', 'When', 'false', 'sense', 'intelligence', 'confidence', 'underscored', 'bitter', 'pathos', 'sadness', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'even', 'been', 'intentional', 'type', 'performance', 'true', 'stars', 'break', 'out', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'more', 'incredibly', 'talented', 'young', 'lady', 'coming', 'years', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'funny', 'engaging', 'thrilling', 'once', 'not', 'particularly', 'order', 'had', 'thinking', 'saw', 'theaters', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'when', 'watched', 'second', 'time', 'weekend', 'satire', 'Mike', 'Judge', 'Idiocracy', 'was', 'going', 'hones', 'something', 'more', 'poignant', 'brutal', 'Postal', 'brain', 'will', 'not', 'win', 'awards', 'far', 'too', 'divisive', 'harsh', 'most', 'audiences', 'comedy', 'situation', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'characters', 'sometimes', 'act', 'figureheads', 'director', 'instead', 'being', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', 'still', 'excellent', 'timr', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection.Overall', 'B+']",N/A

The several movies of his I've seen have been good and this is no exception.Here's the scoop. Frank is kind of a schlub. He's divorced and lives in an unremarkable apartment. His young daughter is spoiled and wants nothing to with him. He loses his job, at an insurance company, for a misinterpreted act of kindness and he's diagnosed with a brain tumor to boot. He's angry at the path America has taken with it's reality shows, religious right and general mean-spiritedness and goes on a killing spree, with a like-minded young lady, to do in all the types that tick him/them off.Goldthwait wrote this script and he's angry. He makes a lot of good points and I can't say I disagree with him on most of them. He made a smart decision in making his protagonist an articulate guy who sticks by his morals (aside from the killing thing), and is consistent. For instance: His young, female protege is rather fetching but he keeps business as business and maintains a platonic relationship with her.There are some lapses in logic throughout, but overall this is very good. I'm not used to seeing Joel Murray as the Alpha Male in a movie but he makes a good everyman here. Tara Lynne Barr makes for a perky sidekick. The story moves logically and the end is fitting.

We live in a narcissistic, arrogant, and selfish country where people are lauded for their fake boobs and their hair extensions, but mocked for reading books and getting good grades. It also, to me, kind of explains what may be going on the minds of rage killers. It is a sort of psychological profile of the death of a man's rational being.He shows a typical American man (not unlike your husband or father) whose life has not turned out the way he planned, but keeps trying to do right. The most poignant point is when he gets fired. Wow! Without revealing too much, I can truly say he was fired for doing something so innocent and kind that most of us have done! The frightening thing is that people really get fired for the same thing. Bobcat shows how far gone our society has come, and still going.I loved the actors.

1536908,AIO247KHD2O40,B007REV6K0,James N Simpson,"[3, 4]","At first I was a little disappointed with this film, it moved at a really slow pace (apart from the odd dream/day dream fantasy), there was a lot of just sitting around flicking channels of the TV by the depressed main character Frank. As well, conversations, such as the one in his work cubicle that just go on, and on.  But about half an hour in, once he steals his neighbours' car and decides he's going to take out someone who doesn't deserve to be alive, when he himself is about die from a brain tumour, and he then encounters the much more energetic Roxy, who saves him from himself, then joins him on his taking out the people who are what is wrong with the world today, it becomes a really fun film.  Granted the movie is not realistic at all, in real life they'd get caught pretty fast since they do nothing to really avoid that, such as ditching a highly visible stolen vehicle, or making any attempt to disguise themselves, but I think the overall over the top unbelievability factor lets you enjoy a film about murdering people, in the same way your 80s slasher film did, whereas with a realistic film you maybe wouldn't.The movie does have a scene near the beginning where while asleep Frank's mind dreams of ending the torment of his noisy selfish neighbours by shooting them, including their baby which never stops crying.  I could understand some people not being comfortable with watching a movie with a baby being killed, and I really don't know why they included that scene other than to create controversy. I mean as you are watching it you're thinking, geese! People are going to complain about that, or even stop watching.  It was a dream by the tired mind of the main character and not something he did in real life in the film but the film and its storyline wouldn't really have suffered if it had been left out.I think both of the main actors did a brilliant job.  I totally bought Joel Murray's performance as a depressed miserable guy who snapped and finally had enough when told he was about to die.  Likewise Tarra Lynne Barr's performance of a school girl aged groupie was brilliant.  I also liked how they went with an 18 year old actress rather than someone around 30 or older like most movies/TV shows do when portraying a teenager.  Obviously Barr's a few years older than the character she was portraying, but still that's better than the usual 15 year gap.  I'd definitely hope she goes onto star in more films in the future.For me though the slow start of the film did lessen it overall, if I watched this again in the future I'd probably skip the beginning. I would have liked to have seen a bit more background on Roxy maybe in there to express to us viewers why she disliked the spoilt girl in her school. Maybe a scene of the girl with her entourage making fun of or bullying Roxy.  I would also have liked to have seen a few more people get their comeuppance, possibly the fun to watch taking out the jerks moments could have been expanded adding another ten minutes or so to the film, as it's only an approximately hour and half length movie.  The ending also was pretty unrealistic, someone surely would have taken a shot before what happens does but I guess this reinforces that this is a fun and not realistic film afterall.I was also disappointed that there were no special features.  A few interviews with the cast, director or something like this, especially being that it's a controversial film would have been nice.",4,"Slow to Get Going, But Once Roxy Appears Becomes the Movie I Had Anticipated",1366848000,"04 25, 2013",2013,3467,"['first', 'was', 'little', 'disappointed', 'film', 'moved', 'really', 'slow', 'pace', 'apart', 'odd', 'dream/day', 'dream', 'fantasy', 'was', 'lot', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'flicking', 'channels', 'TV', 'depressed', 'main', 'character', 'Frank', 'As', 'well', 'conversations', 'such', 'one', 'work', 'cubicle', 'just', 'go', 'hour', 'once', 'neighbours', 'car', 'going', 'take', 'out', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'be', 'alive', 'when', 'die', 'brain', 'tumour', 'then', 'much', 'more', 'energetic', 'Roxy', 'who', 'then', 'taking', 'out', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'what', 'wrong', 'world', 'today', 'really', 'fun', 'film', 'Granted', 'movie', 'not', 'realistic', 'real', 'life', ""'d"", 'get', 'caught', 'pretty', 'fast', 'do', 'nothing', 'really', 'avoid', 'such', 'ditching', 'highly', 'visible', 'stolen', 'vehicle', 'making', 'attempt', 'disguise', 'think', 'overall', 'top', 'unbelievability', 'factor', 'enjoy', 'film', 'murdering', 'people', 'same', 'way', '80s', 'slasher', 'film', 'did', 'whereas', 'realistic', 'film', 'maybe', ""wouldn't.The"", 'movie', 'have', 'scene', 'beginning', 'where', 'asleep', 'Frank', 'mind', 'dreams', 'ending', 'torment', 'noisy', 'selfish', 'neighbours', 'shooting', 'including', 'baby', 'never', 'crying', 'could', 'understand', 'people', 'not', 'being', 'comfortable', 'watching', 'movie', 'baby', 'being', 'killed', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'included', 'scene', 'other', 'create', 'controversy', 'mean', 'are', 'watching', ""'re"", 'thinking', 'geese', 'People', 'are', 'going', 'complain', 'even', 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'dream', 'tired', 'mind', 'main', 'character', 'not', 'something', 'did', 'real', 'life', 'film', 'film', 'storyline', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'suffered', 'had', 'been', 'left', 'out.I', 'think', 'main', 'actors', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'totally', 'bought', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'performance', 'depressed', 'miserable', 'guy', 'who', 'snapped', 'finally', 'had', 'enough', 'when', 'told', 'was', 'about', 'die', 'Likewise', 'Tarra', 'Lynne', 'Barr', 'performance', 'school', 'girl', 'aged', 'groupie', 'was', 'brilliant', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'went', '18', 'year', 'old', 'actress', 'rather', 'someone', 'around', '30', 'older', 'most', 'movies/TV', 'shows', 'do', 'when', 'portraying', 'teenager', 'Obviously', 'Barr', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'character', 'was', 'portraying', 'still', 'better', 'usual', '15', 'year', 'gap', ""'d"", 'definitely', 'hope', 'star', 'more', 'films', 'future.For', 'slow', 'start', 'film', 'did', 'lessen', 'overall', 'watched', 'again', 'future', ""'d"", 'probably', 'skip', 'beginning', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'bit', 'more', 'background', 'Roxy', 'maybe', 'there', 'express', 'viewers', 'why', 'disliked', 'spoilt', 'girl', 'school', 'Maybe', 'scene', 'girl', 'entourage', 'making', 'fun', 'bullying', 'Roxy', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'few', 'more', 'people', 'get', 'comeuppance', 'possibly', 'fun', 'watch', 'taking', 'out', 'jerks', 'moments', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'expanded', 'adding', 'ten', 'minutes', 'so', 'film', 'only', 'approximately', 'hour', 'half', 'length', 'movie', 'ending', 'also', 'was', 'pretty', 'unrealistic', 'someone', 'surely', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'shot', 'what', 'guess', 'fun', 'not', 'realistic', 'film', 'afterall.I', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'were', 'special', 'features', 'few', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'something', 'especially', 'being', 'controversial', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice']",N/A

1536914,A441R59DABT6E,B007REV6K0,J. Griffiths,"[2, 5]",I almost turned it off at the beginning in the office scene. Where the lead character fantasized about shooting his fellow office workers and then got called into the bosses office and got fired for sending flowers to a woman office worker when she went home sick. But the story gets better after that. He then later goes on a killing spree with a uninvited teenage girl. This movie suggests that killing people that are politically or socially repugnant would fix America's problems. In the end the lead characters are just as repugnant as the people there killing. I gave it 3 stars only because I thought it was kind of a interesting twist on the Bonnie and Clyde story and competently done for a low budget movie. But in light of recent shootings around the country I have to wonder if any of the shooters may have gotten their inspiration from watching this movie. There is a scene where the two are in a theater watching a movie when some kids come into the theater and make a bunch of noise. After being asked to please be quiet and there reply was rude the two main characters shoot everyone in the theater except the only person who remained quiet.I watched this movie for free through Amazon Prime just out of curiosity.

Patterson ""cormac""","[2, 4]","This is a movie that &#34;Falling Down&#34; half-assed breezed at, came somewhat close to for about 30 to 45 minutes, but then some producer realized that they would have to show the end result in mainstream corporate-owned-chain-movie theatres and so took a hard turn off the road upon which it started and made a middling weak milk-toast crapfest instead ...&#34;God Bless America&#34; has the high beams on and barrels down this two-lane, ill-lit back road with plenty of potholes full bore, engine screaming, alignment in constant jeaopardy, and a huge rooster-tail of dust arcing into the sky behind them as they go. It doesn't shy away from the subjects that need to be addressed in this country ... such as why the riders of 'the short bus' (as mentioned in the movie) are suddenly on tv and are perfectly fine to laugh at, mock, and ridicule? i recall getting smacked upside the back of the head if i even snickered at these kids because it was impolite ... not to mention that with only an odd chromosonal quirk i could be riding right along with them. They are not to be laughed at. Further, they are not to be pitied. They are to be treated as you would like to be treated. But parading them in front of a tv audience to be mocked is sick yet tv executives and the faithful followers of the show apparently never got clipped in the back of the head like i did ... apparently, they don't know any better, for some reason. Of course, once we start seeing the 'parenting' going on in this movie, and by extension, this country, we soon understand why things are as they are.And so this movie explores those attitudes in America at the beginning of the 21st century. Think about that ... it is the 21st Century and this is our main form of entertainment. When i was a kid there was a movie called &#34;Rollerball&#34; that came out which was the subject of HUGE debates and AGHAST outcries from newspaper editors, tv sports shows (Howard Cosell no less denounced it), and even from the pulpit of the church i was coerced to attend as a young teen. How horrible this movie was to portray such a horrible sport that was played to the death. I suppose some christians might have been a wee-bit sensitive about it since that old coliseum bugaboo might still be up their collective butt (tho somehow i doubt they knew anyone who was closer than a sixth generation removed from those poor sods tossed into the ring) but then to go home after that sermon and watch three straight football games where 22 men filled with the beginnings of the steroid craze and the much better scientifcally explored use of cocaine and speed and painkillers to make these oversized rabid madmen into literal killing machines and not think abother thing about &#34;rollerball&#34; might, to my mind, ended up just a wee-bit hypocritical when was was said and done. After all, football was fine. Not too many people got killed. Some got crippled but once in a wheelchair they soon found god so that was all well and good. (Remember Daryll Stingley was damn near killed by Jack Tatum ... pretty frightening to think what Tatum would have been today with the expert quality of steroid use now available. My god he would have killed someone. I know Wilbur Marshall certainly got as close as anyone i've ever seen.)So i imagine many people will decry &#34;God Bless America&#34; as senseless violence and that the shows they 'fictionlize' in the movie are over-the-top portrayals and not even close to the fine family fare that is offered by the networks and cable. Has anyone watched &#34;Jerry Springer&#34;?Bobcat Goldthwait is a genius who hits it right on the head once again. His view of society is always a bullseye and never wavering. I know why he doesn't get more opportunities to make these kinds of movies. It's amazing they allow him to do the few he does and to get them distributed at all.Bobcat I'm behind you and i'll always be behind you.As for the acting? It's top notch, very natural and shows the perfect amount of affection between Joel Murray (an underrated Murray family talent) and the young and promising Tara Lynne Barr. Can't wait to see more from Barr as well as Murray and Bobcat, of course.And yes, Green Day SUCKS, as I mentioned in another post ... Green Day completely ripped off Stiff Little Fingers and did a piss-poor job of it at that ... listen to SLD and heave your Green Day cd's out the window as you blast down one of this nation's fine interstates.

His flick is bloody self-indulgent, self-satisfied and self-righteous; all of which could be forgiven were it funny, or at least passably entertaining, but it isn't.  It is SO not funny or entertaining; Jesus, it's a 105 minute lecture/sermon.White collar schlub Frank lectures his co-workers about trash-TV and the unraveling of civilization shortly before being called into the boss's office to be canned for sending flowers to the receptionist at her home after she complained about his unwanted ""advances"" (likely another Goldthwaiteian indictment of Souless Corporate Amerika).  He should have been sacked for boring his co-workers to sleep.  Thereafter, Frank decides to off himself, but not, in a last-minute decision, before offing some reality-TV spoiled, rich teenager (how spoiled, how rich, you ask? Well, the Lexus sport coupe' she got for her 16th was just so totally lame).  The murder doesn't go quite as planned, not least because Frank is spotted by another teen, this one a standard-issue spunky, precocious brat who thinks it just totally rad that he offed the spoiled rich brat.  Precocious Brat somehow tracks Frank to his seedy motel room, and they're off!  Cross-country killing spree, complete with Bonny & Clyde habiliment! (PB is really precocious - and hip - she's seen a bloody crime-spree flick made a good thirty years before she was.)Note to Bobcat: Trading in stereotypes - especially tedious and grossly exaggerated stereotypes - doesn't really work with satire.  It tends to get you laughed at instead of your satire.  Also, a little snappy dialog, even cute, precious snappy dialog, say, like Matchstick Men or Paper Moon, would have gone a long way.

This girl hasn't been abused or abandoned, her parents are sensitive and caring, and OK, a little boring, but . . . she lied to him!  Frank packs her off back to the folks, and then there's Frank arming up for the big showdown at the nasty Simon Cowell talent show, and PB showing up just in the nick of time for the tearful reconciliation, and . . . well, fill the rest in yourself; whatever you come up with will be as good or better than BG's.==================================================================PS:  Speaking of the cultural trashosphere, while Goldthwaite's depiction seems way over the top, I must confess that I wouldn't really know for sure - I've never actually seen one of those reality TV series, or celebrity trash series, and I try to pay as little attention as possible to hate preachers, rabid-right (or loony-tune left) broadcasters, etc.",1,"Inane, adolescent, boring",1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,3315,"['Spoiled', 'entitled', 'Hollywood', 'celeb', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwaite', 'aim', 'spoiled', 'America', 'clueless', 'stump', ""n't"", 'realize', 'hit', 'not', 'just', 'foot', 'flick', 'bloody', 'self-indulgent', 'self-satisfied', 'self-righteous', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'were', 'funny', 'least', 'passably', 'entertaining', ""n't"", 'SO', 'not', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'Jesus', '105', 'minute', 'lecture/sermon.White', 'collar', 'schlub', 'Frank', 'co-workers', 'trash-TV', 'unraveling', 'civilization', 'shortly', 'being', 'called', 'boss', 'office', 'be', 'canned', 'sending', 'flowers', 'receptionist', 'home', 'complained', 'unwanted', 'advances', 'likely', 'Goldthwaiteian', 'indictment', 'Souless', 'Corporate', 'Amerika', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'sacked', 'boring', 'co-workers', 'sleep', 'Thereafter', 'Frank', 'off', 'not', 'last-minute', 'decision', 'offing', 'reality-TV', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'teenager', 'how', 'spoiled', 'how', 'rich', 'ask', 'Well', 'Lexus', 'sport', 'coupe', 'got', '16th', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'totally', 'lame', 'murder', ""n't"", 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'planned', 'not', 'least', 'Frank', 'spotted', 'teen', 'one', 'standard-issue', 'spunky', 'precocious', 'brat', 'who', 'just', 'totally', 'rad', 'offed', 'spoiled', 'rich', 'brat', 'Precocious', 'Brat', 'somehow', 'tracks', 'Frank', 'seedy', 'motel', 'room', ""'re"", 'off', 'Cross-country', 'killing', 'spree', 'complete', 'Bonny', 'Clyde', 'habiliment', 'PB', 'really', 'precocious', 'hip', 'seen', 'bloody', 'crime-spree', 'flick', 'made', 'good', 'thirty', 'years', 'was', 'Note', 'Bobcat', 'Trading', 'stereotypes', 'especially', 'tedious', 'grossly', 'exaggerated', 'stereotypes', ""n't"", 'really', 'work', 'satire', 'get', 'laughed', 'instead', 'satire', 'Also', 'little', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'even', 'cute', 'precious', 'snappy', 'dialog', 'say', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'Paper', 'Moon', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'Dialog', 'Exploited', 'tragedies', 'further', 'agenda', 'big', 'oil', 'companies', 'right', 'keep', 'boiling', 'world', 'alive', 'just', 'papa-surrogate', 'take', 'off', '12mpg', 'American', 'muscle', 'car', 'will', 'get', 'laughs', 'right', 'not', 'way', ""'ll"", 'like.Anyway', 'Frank', 'PB', 'rid', 'country', 'few', 'real', 'imagined', 'stereotypes', 'enlightened', 'entitled', 'Goldthwaite', ""n't"", 'like', ""n't"", 'make', 'guess', 'Precocious', 'Brat', 'most', 'off', 'second', 'scene', 'Frank', 'watching', 'news', 'are', 'sitting', 'down', 'been', 'had', 'girl', ""n't"", 'been', 'abused', 'abandoned', 'parents', 'are', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'OK', 'little', 'boring', 'lied', 'Frank', 'off', 'back', 'folks', 'then', 'Frank', 'arming', 'up', 'big', 'showdown', 'nasty', 'Simon', 'Cowell', 'talent', 'show', 'PB', 'showing', 'up', 'just', 'nick', 'time', 'tearful', 'reconciliation', 'well', 'fill', 'rest', 'come', 'up', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'better', ""BG's.==================================================================PS"", 'Speaking', 'cultural', 'trashosphere', 'Goldthwaite', 'depiction', 'way', 'top', 'must', 'confess', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'never', 'actually', 'seen', 'one', 'reality', 'TV', 'series', 'celebrity', 'trash', 'series', 'try', 'pay', 'as', 'little', 'attention', 'possible', 'hate', 'preachers', 'rabid-right', 'loony-tune', 'left', 'broadcasters', 'etc']",N/A

1536926,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B007REV6K0,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[11, 31]","I really wanted to like this movie. I loved Goldthwait's last film --World's Greatest Dad-- a scathing critique of contemporary culture as well as parenthood and what it takes to get noticed (let alone loved). I also loved the trailer for GOD BLESS AMERICA. If you haven't seen it, it neatly encapsulates what the film is about, but also gives it a high-speed, pitch-perfect tone. Estranged from his young daughter and ex-wife, fired from his work on a ridiculous technicality, and beset on all sides by the loud, crass, obnoxious death rattle of American Culture, gravelly-voiced Frank finally snaps when a callous doctor informs him that he has an inoperable brain tumor. He decides to spend his remaining time on Earth cleaning house, and thus begins a cross-country murder spree, with Frank gunning down everyone from rude theater audiences to double-parkers, as well as some big dogs, such as an inflammatory Bill O'Reilly clone and the cast and fans of American Superstar (an American Idol spoof).Anyone with half a brainwave will have some sympathy for Frank, if not a hidden desire to see his vengeance take some shape. The trailer really milks this and milks it well. The movie ... not so much.It is almost as if Goldthwait came up with the idea for the trailer first. What works about the film -- Frank's descent into madness -- is mostly tip-toed around. Great pains are taken to show us that Frank is, at heart, a decent guy, and the movie does everything in its power to paint him as sympathetically as possible. The world Frank lives in is a nightmare full of loud morons and entitled screaming, and when Frank finally rants against it, his speech is perfectly articulated, obviously rehearsed, and just as obnoxious, in its way, as the Me-Me-Me culture it rails against.For a movie about a serial killer, the film moves sluggishly. In between Frank's self-righteous monologues, there are very long shots of Frank driving or sitting in his car, always accompanied by loud rock music with lyrics that pretty much spell out the emotions you're supposed to be seeing in Frank. The self-righteous monologues get even more intolerable when Frank is joined in his quest by the young Roxy, a Juno-esque character who gets an entire scene where she rails against the movie JUNO and explains in great detail her love of Alice Cooper. Roxy hardly feels real at all. It is as if Goldthwait created two avatars for his personality: the half that is sad (Frank) and the half that is angry (Roxy). Roxy pushes Frank's quest to ever greater extremes, but her motivation in the film never makes any sense, and she seems more like the devil on Frank's shoulder than the cool, witty, anti-establishment teen she's supposed to be.The movie fails most of all because it waters-down its own satire. If these characters were not presented so apologetically or with such slick soliloquies, if they were presented even just fractionally as a part of the problem, then the movie would have a story, characters, and a message worth thinking about. Frank occasionally has chances to move the story into areas more fraught with questions, complications, and intrigue -- his ex's new hubby is a cop, Roxy is just as obsessed with the media as the people she's always complaining about, Frank's own daughter is slowly turning into the same type of person he starts his murder spree with -- but just as you think the film is setting Frank up to face some serious questions, it veers back into music video wish fulfillment.Goldthwait made this film for one reason: he wanted to put onto a screen the stuff he probably spends a great deal of time thinking to himself. The reason why Alice Cooper is a rock god. Just exactly what's wrong with Americans and American culture these days. All of the people who deserve to die violent deaths -- most of whom, by the way, are conservative, Fox News types. Instead of using this opportunity to show all the ways the world is screwed up -- not just from the ""pop politics"" (both right and left), but also from the people who rage against the rage, who scream about the screaming, and who hate all of the hate -- this movie sticks with one note, and it doesn't even play it very well or consistently.Watch the trailer, close your eyes, and picture all the people YOU think deserve to die. You'll have a better time than if you watch this film.",2,A Rant In Movie's Clothing,1337212800,"05 17, 2012",2012,4365,"['really', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'loved', 'Goldthwait', 'last', 'film', 'World', 'Greatest', 'Dad', 'scathing', 'critique', 'contemporary', 'culture', 'as', 'well', 'parenthood', 'what', 'get', 'noticed', 'let', 'alone', 'loved', 'also', 'loved', 'trailer', 'GOD', 'BLESS', 'AMERICA', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'neatly', 'what', 'film', 'also', 'high-speed', 'pitch-perfect', 'tone', 'Estranged', 'young', 'daughter', 'ex-wife', 'fired', 'work', 'ridiculous', 'technicality', 'beset', 'sides', 'loud', 'crass', 'obnoxious', 'death', 'rattle', 'American', 'Culture', 'gravelly-voiced', 'Frank', 'finally', 'when', 'callous', 'doctor', 'inoperable', 'brain', 'tumor', 'spend', 'remaining', 'time', 'Earth', 'cleaning', 'house', 'thus', 'cross-country', 'murder', 'spree', 'Frank', 'gunning', 'down', 'everyone', 'rude', 'theater', 'audiences', 'double-parkers', 'as', 'well', 'big', 'dogs', 'such', 'inflammatory', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'clone', 'cast', 'fans', 'American', 'Superstar', 'American', 'Idol', 'spoof', '.Anyone', 'brainwave', 'will', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Frank', 'not', 'hidden', 'desire', 'see', 'vengeance', 'take', 'shape', 'trailer', 'really', 'milks', 'well', 'movie', 'not', 'much.It', 'almost', 'Goldthwait', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'trailer', 'first', 'What', 'film', 'Frank', 'descent', 'madness', 'mostly', 'tip-toed', 'Great', 'pains', 'are', 'taken', 'show', 'Frank', 'heart', 'decent', 'guy', 'movie', 'everything', 'power', 'paint', 'as', 'sympathetically', 'possible', 'world', 'Frank', 'nightmare', 'full', 'loud', 'morons', 'entitled', 'screaming', 'when', 'Frank', 'finally', 'speech', 'perfectly', 'articulated', 'obviously', 'rehearsed', 'just', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'way', 'Me-Me-Me', 'culture', 'against.For', 'movie', 'serial', 'killer', 'film', 'sluggishly', 'Frank', 'self-righteous', 'monologues', 'are', 'very', 'long', 'shots', 'Frank', 'driving', 'sitting', 'car', 'always', 'accompanied', 'loud', 'rock', 'music', 'lyrics', 'pretty', 'much', 'spell', 'out', 'emotions', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'be', 'seeing', 'Frank', 'self-righteous', 'monologues', 'get', 'even', 'more', 'intolerable', 'when', 'Frank', 'joined', 'quest', 'young', 'Roxy', 'Juno-esque', 'character', 'who', 'entire', 'scene', 'where', 'movie', 'JUNO', 'great', 'detail', 'love', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'Roxy', 'hardly', 'real', 'Goldthwait', 'created', 'two', 'avatars', 'personality', 'half', 'sad', 'Frank', 'half', 'angry', 'Roxy', 'Roxy', 'pushes', 'Frank', 'quest', 'ever', 'greater', 'extremes', 'motivation', 'film', 'never', 'sense', 'more', 'devil', 'Frank', 'shoulder', 'cool', 'witty', 'anti-establishment', 'teen', 'supposed', 'be.The', 'movie', 'most', 'waters-down', 'own', 'satire', 'characters', 'were', 'not', 'presented', 'so', 'apologetically', 'such', 'slick', 'soliloquies', 'were', 'presented', 'even', 'just', 'fractionally', 'part', 'problem', 'then', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'story', 'characters', 'message', 'worth', 'thinking', 'Frank', 'occasionally', 'chances', 'move', 'story', 'areas', 'more', 'fraught', 'questions', 'complications', 'intrigue', 'ex', 'new', 'hubby', 'cop', 'Roxy', 'just', 'obsessed', 'media', 'people', 'always', 'complaining', 'Frank', 'own', 'daughter', 'slowly', 'turning', 'same', 'type', 'person', 'murder', 'spree', 'just', 'think', 'film', 'setting', 'Frank', 'up', 'face', 'serious', 'questions', 'back', 'music', 'video', 'wish', 'fulfillment.Goldthwait', 'made', 'film', 'one', 'reason', 'wanted', 'put', 'screen', 'stuff', 'probably', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'thinking', 'reason', 'why', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'rock', 'god', 'Just', 'exactly', 'what', 'wrong', 'Americans', 'American', 'culture', 'days', 'people', 'who', 'deserve', 'die', 'violent', 'deaths', 'most', 'whom', 'way', 'are', 'conservative', 'Fox', 'News', 'types', 'Instead', 'using', 'opportunity', 'show', 'ways', 'world', 'screwed', 'up', 'not', 'just', 'pop', 'politics', 'right', 'left', 'also', 'people', 'who', 'rage', 'rage', 'who', 'scream', 'screaming', 'who', 'hate', 'hate', 'movie', 'one', 'note', ""n't"", 'even', 'play', 'very', 'well', 'consistently.Watch', 'trailer', 'close', 'eyes', 'picture', 'people', 'YOU', 'think', 'deserve', 'die', ""'ll"", 'have', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'film']",N/A

It's a statement embedded in good acting and pretty cinematography.It features a plotline that is by no means wholly believeable (that never stopped anyone from making an episode of The Mentalist) and it is nothing *like* entirely pleasant (that never stopped anyone from watching an episode of The Mentalist) in which two alienated loners, a divorced middle-aged man and a too-clever teenaged girl, find one another and go on a killing spree that features representations from a rogue's gallery of American incivlity and mental degeneration; one that includes, among others, a Glenn Beck clone, a ""God-hates-gays"" preacher and a large sampling of the superficial, the cruel, the entitled and the merely rude.It is a rant wrapped in a thin layer of movie that displays a very linnear, paint-by-the-numbers plot, the point of which makes the movie almost like something Brecht might have written were he alive today. Goldthwaite's story and how he tells it, like Brecht's, pushes the viewer back far enough to see the point: that we are so bombarded by multimillionaire media personalities vomiting nonsense, dwarf-tossers, infinitely entitled celebrities and the people who have given us the worst of YouTube, that our world is riddled by a media-fueled cancer of noise in which each tumor of diseased culture is replaced by the next one so quickly that horrible events driven by horrible people have become our norm and we cease to notice the presence of the disease, that things were ever otherwise,  or to imagine that anything else is possible.""God Bless America"" is a black comedy that at times is not entirely funny, but that is nevertheless worth watching for its point.If it *was* entirely funny, it would be part of the problem.",5,Black Comedy?

1536928,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B007REV6K0,Mark Turner,"[0, 1]","Why bad timing? Well let's get the plot discussed first and move on to that. Frank (Joel Murray) is having the worst time ever. His neighbors are the worst ever, constantly fighting until the wee hours of the night with a baby that won't stop crying. Frank watches TV to deaden the sound but the things he sees there are so terrible it doesn't help, everything from being able to buy farting pig ring tones to reality shows where terrible women toss used tampons at one another in anger. When he sees a singing competition show (only someone living in a cave won't recognize the jab here), he sees everyone on the show making fun of a contestant who has no idea just how terrible he sounds. But it gets worse.Frank goes to work where co-workers seem like the rest of the world, eager to make fun of people and talk trash thinking that's entertainment, discussing the loser on the singing program non-stop. When he tries to tell a co-worker how terrible it is that people seem to have nothing better to do than be uncivil to one another he's called to the office to discover he's being fired. His transgression was that he sent flowers to the receptionist because she told him she was having a bad day. In today's world this constitutes sexual harassment. To cap off his day, Frank goes to his doctor to find out he has an inoperable brain tumor.Going home with the intent of killing himself, Frank once more turns on TV only to witness a reality show where a rich spoiled brat complains about everything going so far as to curse out her parents for buying her the wrong car for her birthday. Frank has had enough. He goes to the town where the girl lives and watches her until he has the chance and then kills her. A young girl witnesses the killing and tells him he's fantastic for doing so. A twist leads the girl to join Frank and off they go on a road trip where they discuss and sometimes kill those who are uncivil to everyone else.I know, it sounds twisted and a bit rough. But then again keep in mind this is a dark comedy from director/writer Bobcat Goldthwait who has made some seriously dark comedies in the past as well. At least one moment will place this movie in the category of pitch black dark comedy. Amazingly enough for the violence in the film the truth is the concept behind it IS that the world has become uncivil and he's trying to point that out. The shows on TV celebrate how nasty we can be to one another. Pop-tart stars seem to be the focus of everyone's life these days, who they slept with, where they go, what they wear and more. I mean can anyone honestly tell me why we have more than one series on TV talking about a Kardashian? What did they accomplish or do that deserved a TV series?If you can get past the violence (and especially something that even I think was over the top in the first 10 minutes of the movie) then you'll find some seriously funny stuff here. The movie hits the mark in the idea of what it is trying to discuss and satirize. Popular culture has taken a turn for the worse in the past decade or so. Discussions on serious topics have gone to the wayside leaving us talking about nonsensical things. We now praise that which we used to scorn. And this movie shows us that.So why is it bad timing? The first reason is the violence, the choice of the main characters to use guns to solve their problems. More and more every day people are actually doing this in real life. Within weeks prior to this film coming out on DVD there have been several shootings where individuals have gone off the deep end killing groups of people. But rather than blame that person, we still look to find something to blame it on.Secondly is a sequence in the film that seems as if Bobcat saw it coming. While watching a documentary in a theater, Frank and Roxy deal with punk kids who toss popcorn at them and continue to use their cell phone and talk while the movie is on. Eventually (and this isn't a spoiler since it was in the trailer), Frank turns around and shoots each offender. While many of us have had to deal with inconsiderate patrons at theaters often, the recent shooting in Aurora make this sequence seem a little eerie. While it might have been something to laugh at over a month ago, now it just seems too real.The often say that art imitates life and in this case it does indeed. The movie is actually quite good and says a lot of things that many people feel is true. The violence will turn off some, especially since there is humor tied to it. But that's always been the case with dark comedy. Thirty seven years ago (has it really been that long?) it was Monty Python lopping off the arms and legs of the Black Knight. Times change and things get increasingly more intense. If you can overlook that and realize that this is a comedy then you're in for a treat. If you're too sensitive then look for another film. This movie is one of the better films I've seen this past year. I would say it's too bad about the timing of the release but instead I'll say it's too bad that someone would actually take things to this extreme in real life.",4,BAD TIMING FOR FUNNY

1536929,A1H9EF4S5I9OKX,B007REV6K0,M. Bullions,"[2, 3]","Once every not-so-often, I come across a movie that hits me like a punch in the face. Everything about it rings true &#8211; the script is full of zingy one-liners, the cast knows what they&#8217;re doing and it feels like this thing was made for a very good reason. This happens once in a blue moon. In this case, I&#8217;m going to tell you about a little movie I just watched called &#8220;God Bless America&#8221;.Frank Murdoch (Joel Murray) is a normal guy. He&#8217;s divorced, and his daughter is a little whiny brat, very much the product of her environment. Frank sits on his couch every night, trying to find something good on television. He sees the disgusting behavior glorified on singing and mean-girl reality shows. The problem is that this country eats this stuff up like it&#8217;s candy. People can&#8217;t get enough of their dumb entertainment and famous-for-being-famous celebutards. Frank finds out he has a massive brain tumor and will likely die soon. He considers suicide, but ultimately goes on a rampage to kill all of the stupid people wasting space on this good Earth. Likeminded teenager Roxie (Tara Lynne Barr) eventually joins forces with him, and they become a team devoted to making the world a better place, one murder at a time.With all of the mass-shootings and equally disgusting violent crime depicted on the local news every day, it&#8217;s obvious that a film this honest and cynical might not be for everyone. It glorifies violence, but at the same time it doesn&#8217;t. It is not a film of ideas, but a film of reactions. If you fall outside of the bell curve of American people who love trash culture, you might really enjoy this movie. In the back of your head, you may have wondered all along, &#8220;what would happen if someone just killed these idiots once and for all?&#8221;Another thing that makes this film remarkable to me is that it&#8217;s full of unknown actors, and yet it features two of the most memorable performances in recent memory. Murray is perfectly cast as the everyman who has simply had enough already, and Barr brings a whole lot of fun to the table. This movie will make neither of these people stars, because it&#8217;s so gloriously politically incorrect, and will likely not be accepted by the masses.&#8220;God Bless America&#8221; is a scathing satire with a gaping hole where its heart should be. It doesn&#8217;t need a heart, for it has a brain. It&#8217;s a sobering and perceptive statement on where we stand as a culture at this point in time. Even though this movie is a few years old, it feels as if it was made yesterday. It could be dismissed as left-wing propaganda, because sometimes it does get a bit heavy-handed with the political side (a Glenn Beck type is brutally murdered), it provides a point of view that isn&#8217;t biased, because in some way, we all kind of relate to Frank. If you find yourself on the couch looking for something to watch on Netflix, give God Bless America a try. It&#8217;ll give you plenty to laugh about, but a lot more to think about.Grade: A+",5,&#8220;Why have a civilization if we are no longer interested in being civilized?&#8221;,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",2014,3067,"['Once', 'not-so-often', 'come', 'movie', 'punch', 'face', 'Everything', 'true', '8211', 'script', 'full', 'zingy', 'one-liners', 'cast', 'what', '8217', 're', 'doing', 'thing', 'was', 'made', 'very', 'good', 'reason', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'case', '8217', 'going', 'tell', 'little', 'movie', 'just', 'watched', 'called', '8220', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', '8221', 'Murdoch', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'normal', 'guy', '8217', 's', 'divorced', 'daughter', 'little', 'whiny', 'brat', 'very', 'much', 'product', 'environment', 'Frank', 'couch', 'night', 'trying', 'find', 'something', 'good', 'television', 'disgusting', 'behavior', 'glorified', 'singing', 'mean-girl', 'reality', 'shows', 'problem', 'country', 'stuff', '8217', 'candy', 'People', 'can', '8217', 'get', 'enough', 'dumb', 'entertainment', 'famous-for-being-famous', 'celebutards', 'Frank', 'out', 'massive', 'brain', 'tumor', 'will', 'likely', 'die', 'soon', 'suicide', 'ultimately', 'rampage', 'kill', 'stupid', 'people', 'wasting', 'space', 'good', 'Earth', 'Likeminded', 'teenager', 'Roxie', 'Tara', 'Lynne', 'Barr', 'eventually', 'forces', 'become', 'team', 'devoted', 'making', 'world', 'better', 'place', 'one', 'murder', 'time.With', 'mass-shootings', 'equally', 'disgusting', 'violent', 'crime', 'depicted', 'local', 'news', 'day', '8217', 'obvious', 'film', 'honest', 'cynical', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'violence', 'same', 'time', '8217', 't.', 'not', 'film', 'ideas', 'film', 'reactions', 'fall', 'bell', 'curve', 'American', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'trash', 'culture', 'might', 'really', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'back', 'head', 'may', 'have', 'wondered', '8220', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'someone', 'just', 'killed', 'idiots', 'once', '8221', 'thing', 'film', 'remarkable', '8217', 'full', 'unknown', 'actors', 'yet', 'two', 'most', 'memorable', 'performances', 'recent', 'memory', 'Murray', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'everyman', 'who', 'simply', 'had', 'enough', 'already', 'Barr', 'whole', 'lot', 'fun', 'table', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'people', 'stars', '8217', 'so', 'gloriously', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'will', 'likely', 'not', 'be', 'accepted', 'masses.', '8220', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', '8221', 'scathing', 'satire', 'gaping', 'hole', 'where', 'heart', 'should', 'be', '8217', 'need', 'heart', 'brain', '8217', 's', 'sobering', 'perceptive', 'statement', 'where', 'stand', 'culture', 'point', 'time', 'Even', 'movie', 'few', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'made', 'yesterday', 'could', 'be', 'dismissed', 'left-wing', 'propaganda', 'sometimes', 'get', 'bit', 'heavy-handed', 'political', 'side', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'type', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'point', 'view', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'biased', 'way', 'kind', 'relate', 'Frank', 'find', 'couch', 'looking', 'something', 'watch', 'Netflix', 'give', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'try', '8217', 'give', 'plenty', 'laugh', 'about', 'lot', 'more', 'think', 'about.Grade', 'A+']",N/A

1536931,A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,B007REV6K0,"Michael J. Tresca ""Talien""","[4, 6]","God Bless America is from the warped mind of Bobcat Goldthwait, the screechy voiced freak who was a staple of comedy films in the 80s (and cartoon voices of the 90s).  It turns out Goldthwait is a gifted writer too with an acerbic wit, which he puts to bloody use in ""God Bless America.""""God Bless America"" uses ""Falling Down,"" as a template: middle-class loner Frank Murdoch (Joel Murray) fails at life and love, is fired from  his job, and decides to start fixing things by killing people.  When a movie begins with a baby being killed with a shotgun, you know you're in for some polarizing stuff. Fortunately, it's just a dream sequence (even Goldthwait isn't that crazy), but the plan that hatches in the mind of Murdoch is to simply fix the impolite world he lives in.And that impolite world is a largely liberal fantasy.  The Westboro Baptists who protest everything, Bill O'Reilly's polemics, the Tea Party, and reality show stars are just a few of the people who earn Murdoch's bloody wrath. He is joined by underage Chloe (Maddie Hasson) who decides going on the run with a murderer is still better than surviving high school, and it's not long before she becomes a fervent endorser of Murdoch's means if not his methods.If you can look past the obvious provocation, there's something quaint about how Goldthwait works in the idea that reality shows are based on reality and that it's somehow morally okay to kill people you disagree with, because that's still more polite than having to deal with them.If Goldthwait simply left it at that, this would just be another revenge fantasy film.  But he doesn't, and he doesn't let his characters off the hook either. They are all deeply flawed, morally bereft, and hypocrites in their own secret ways.  ""God Bless America"" is less about the moral rot that is on display every day and more about our own disempowerment.

People are just mean and stupid.

She got a Lexus sedan instead of the Escalade she wanted.  He stalks her at school and takes her out.  This is witnessed by another high school girl named Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) who applauds Frank's actions and suggests she come along for further liquidations of people who ""deserve to die.""While this could get pervy real quick with 50 something Frank taking up with a cute teen outcast, director and writer Bobcat Goldthwait never goes in that direction.  He just allows the pair to kill annoying people.  You know, people who talk or use cell phones in movie theaters, people who hog parking spaces.  He is also upset with mean right wing talk show hosts, religious zealots and ""American Idol"" type shows.Goldthwait doesn't pull any punches and you will certainly recognize the thinly veiled celebrities he goes after.

For some reason, I came back the next day and finished the film.  I should have gone with my first instinct; it did not get any better.  Although I agree with most of the politics in the film, I felt that any meaningful social message is lost in a flood of bullets and cliches.  It is almost like watching one of Bobcat Goldwaith's stand up routines from the 80's, where he screams at you half the time and you really do not understand what he is saying.  The movie works best during the times the main character reflects on our society.  Yes, we have become a society that is dumbed down by asinine reality shows, loud-mouth conservative talk radio hosts, people at rallies that have no clue what they really stand for, and too many individuals that just don't seem to show any common sense.  Many of the targets that the movie focuses on are those that I too have issues with.  But... enough to go on a murderous rampage? In light of the events that have taken place in our nation recently, not only is is not good entertainment, but is is downright irresponsible. Throughout the movie, the main characters talk about people that ""..deserve to die.""  Really? People that irritate me in the movie theater deserve to die?  Even people like Glenn Beck, Tea Party Member, and those protesting soldier funerals do not deserve to die.  I disagree with their points of view vehemently, but would never wish any harm upon them.  Really, in the end, the only people that truly deserve to die where the main characters.  What point is Goldwaith trying make? Does he seriously not think that murderous thugs with easy access to guns are an even BIGGER threat to our society than American Idol judges? And also, for someone that seems to have a disdain for cliche, he throws quite a bit of them around.  He takes pot shots at Diablo Cody, while creating a character that is indeed essentially a more mean-spirited and psychotic Juno.  And, the final shootout at the theater? No, that was not too Bonnie and Clyde, was it.  This was a truly badly conceived film.

I was going to chastise myself for enjoying watching horrific reality show divas getting killed or maybe some folks to talk on their cell phones during movies.  I mean, don't we ALL hate that.  Sure, I would have felt bad for enjoying the fantasy, because enjoyment would imply some level of agreement.  I was prepared to live with that!But writer/director Bobcat Goldthwaite made a couple of key miscalculations.  First and foremost, he veers too much from targets we can all agree with (rude neighbors, gossip mongering TMZ hosts, people who double park on purpose) to political targets.  The main character in the movie, Frank, starts out wanting to get rid of rude people or those who aren't ""nice.""  Yet much of his ire is focused on conservative talk show hosts and the Tea Party.  The film does more than imply that most of the rudeness and decline in civilized discourse in our country is due to ""the right wing"", as though Chris Matthews or Keith Olbermann were the most civil folks on TV.  It equates those hate-mongering crazies who demonstrate at soldiers' funerals about God hating gays with everyday Tea Party members, who assemble peacefully.  WHY drag cheap & incorrect political targets into this when there are so many non-partisan jerks in the world that we can all agree on wiping out?At the beginning of the film we spend A LOT of time getting to see Frank (an actually pretty terrific Joel Murray) sink into the despair that leads him to kill (rather than his first temptation, suicide).  He gets fired for no good reason and then is diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor.  He figures he should clean up some of America's mess first and (without spoiling anything) ends up partnering with a precocious and VERY rude & angry teenage girl named Roxy.  (I call her ""very rude"" because she really seems like someone Frank might actually want to target not befriend.)Also, even if the politics don't bother you, it's likely the fact that the violence, while bloody when it occurs, is actually pretty infrequent.  From the needlessly long build-up to the extended scenes of the two partners chatting (some of the scenes are good, others are repetitive)...GOD BLESS AMERICA frequently drags quite badly.There are some amusing moments and one that made me laugh outloud, involving an effort to light the gas tank of a car.  The music selections, including lots of Alice Cooper and a GREAT Kinks song, are good.  And Joel Murray certainly showed that he needs a good, big role to chew into.But the poor pacing, needless stereotyping of 50% of America and a terrible ending weight down the kernels of goodness in this film, and I cannot recommend it.",2,The promise of a cathartic experience ruined,1344643200,"08 11, 2012",2012,3333,"['Movies', 'FALLING', 'DOWN', 'degree', 'OFFICE', 'SPACE', 'are', 'fun', 'feature', 'folks', 'rebelling', 'mundane', 'stupidities', 'life', 'ways', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'real', 'life', 'wish', 'surrogates', 'well', 'watch', 'are', 'taking', 'action', 'anger', 'experience', 'when', 'McDonald', 'stops', 'service', 'breakfast', '14', 'seconds', 'get', 'counter', 'order', 'even', ""'ve"", 'been', 'waiting', 'line', '3', 'minutes', 'when', 'bosses', 'demand', 'darn', 'TPS', 'report', 'GOD', 'BLESS', 'AMERICA', 'trailers', 'promised', 'be', 'similar', 'ilk', 'only', 'more', 'violent', 'black', 'Certainly', 'lot', 'more', 'violence', 'bloodshed', 'was', 'expecting', 'guilty-pleasure', 'catharsis', 'was', 'going', 'chastise', 'enjoying', 'watching', 'horrific', 'reality', 'show', 'getting', 'killed', 'maybe', 'folks', 'talk', 'cell', 'phones', 'movies', 'mean', 'do', ""n't"", 'ALL', 'hate', 'Sure', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'bad', 'enjoying', 'fantasy', 'enjoyment', 'would', 'imply', 'level', 'agreement', 'was', 'prepared', 'live', 'writer/director', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwaite', 'made', 'couple', 'key', 'miscalculations', 'First', 'foremost', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'agree', 'rude', 'neighbors', 'gossip', 'mongering', 'TMZ', 'hosts', 'people', 'who', 'double', 'park', 'purpose', 'political', 'targets', 'main', 'character', 'movie', 'Frank', 'out', 'wanting', 'get', 'rid', 'rude', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'nice', 'Yet', 'much', 'ire', 'focused', 'conservative', 'talk', 'show', 'hosts', 'Tea', 'Party', 'film', 'more', 'imply', 'most', 'rudeness', 'decline', 'civilized', 'discourse', 'country', 'due', 'right', 'wing', 'Chris', 'Matthews', 'Keith', 'Olbermann', 'were', 'most', 'civil', 'folks', 'TV', 'hate-mongering', 'crazies', 'who', 'demonstrate', 'soldiers', 'funerals', 'God', 'hating', 'gays', 'everyday', 'Tea', 'Party', 'members', 'who', 'assemble', 'peacefully', 'WHY', 'drag', 'cheap', 'incorrect', 'political', 'targets', 'when', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'non-partisan', 'jerks', 'world', 'can', 'agree', 'wiping', 'out', 'beginning', 'film', 'spend', 'LOT', 'time', 'getting', 'see', 'Frank', 'actually', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'sink', 'despair', 'kill', 'rather', 'first', 'temptation', 'suicide', 'fired', 'good', 'reason', 'then', 'diagnosed', 'fatal', 'brain', 'tumor', 'should', 'clean', 'up', 'America', 'mess', 'first', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'up', 'partnering', 'precocious', 'VERY', 'rude', 'angry', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Roxy', 'call', 'very', 'rude', 'really', 'someone', 'Frank', 'might', 'actually', 'want', 'target', 'not', 'befriend', 'Also', 'even', 'politics', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'likely', 'fact', 'violence', 'bloody', 'when', 'actually', 'pretty', 'infrequent', 'needlessly', 'long', 'build-up', 'extended', 'scenes', 'two', 'partners', 'chatting', 'scenes', 'are', 'good', 'others', 'are', 'repetitive', 'GOD', 'BLESS', 'AMERICA', 'frequently', 'quite', 'are', 'amusing', 'moments', 'one', 'made', 'outloud', 'involving', 'effort', 'light', 'gas', 'tank', 'car', 'music', 'selections', 'including', 'lots', 'Alice', 'Cooper', 'GREAT', 'Kinks', 'song', 'are', 'good', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'certainly', 'showed', 'good', 'big', 'role', 'chew', 'into.But', 'poor', 'pacing', 'needless', 'stereotyping', '50', '%', 'America', 'terrible', 'ending', 'weight', 'down', 'kernels', 'goodness', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'recommend']",N/A

I like all of those things, and even when I disagree with him, I still like seeing what he's up to whether it be in stand up or directing a new movie. As a writer and director Goldthwait has improved dramatically over the years, and this is a very well made movie that is an impressive creative achievement, even though I do quibble with one of its premises. As Bobcat explains in one of the (excellent) extras, the film is about &#34;a liberal with a gun&#34; and is &#34;a call for kindness.&#34; I agree with him on both accounts, and appreciate the fight Goldthwait wages against rampant materialism, societal ugliness and irresponsibility, and narcissism. These are completely valid targets for a satire and wry cultural commentary, and Bobcat excels at skewering these excesses mostly through the technique of mocking reality shows which here are thinly disguised counterparts of actual televised atrocities (e.g. &#34;American Superstarz.&#34;)The protagonists, Frank (Joel Murray) and Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) have had enough with society and take out miscreants one jerk at a time in a wicked killing spree. Most of this is directed against reality star Chloe, her awful family, and the like, but the added theme is that the political right is a key underpinning of the lack of civility with typical xenophobia and oil company propaganda masquerading as genuine political positions and news stories with captions like &#34;Tea Party Members Assault Parkinson's Sufferer.&#34; I would be curious how many of the producers in Hollywood behind the reality shows he skewers so well are Fox News acolytes. (I'm guessing none.) I am not defending the likes of Sean Hannity here (he can defend himself just fine, and I haven't watched him since Alan Colmes left,) but I guess Bobcat missed Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthew's venom over the last decade or so. Bobcat is welcome to make any political point he wishes of course (it's his movie,) but it's fair to point out the philosophical disconnect that if he's arguing that reality shows and popular culture are making the US a meaner country (I believe they are and completely agree with the premise, by the way,) he is blaming the wrong side of the political fence for this problem, rendering the plea in the film that &#34;there's no right or wrong&#34; anymore moot. In the film's climax Frank makes a valid criticism that &#34;America has become a cruel and vicious place. We reward the shallowest, the dumbest, the meanest, and the loudest.&#34; That is completely true on reality television, and as I have stated I think it's not only to the key to the film, it's a genuine societal concern. What gets lost in this vision though is that reality television isn't reality.Having explained my philosophical differences with the film let me tell you why I liked it. It's extraordinarily well acted and directed. Camera work is excellent throughout, and the ambience of the film makes the characters sympathetic despite their deeply sociopathic crimes. Although I don't agree with all his positions, I do think Goldthwait's &#34;call for kindness&#34; (as odd as that may sound given the context) is brilliantly written and makes excellent points about American pop culture; I'm glad he made them, as he can do so with more nuance than most. The extras are also superior: the interviews are golden with a few hidden gems emerging: see Bobcat explain why &#34;Oliver Stone has the sense of humor of a Vulcan,&#34; and why he wants to get a merkin for his eyebrows, among many other humorous diversions.This movie will not be for everyone, but if you loathe reality television and have no objection to satirical violence with a point, I recommend it to all open-minded viewers.",4,A Violent Plea For Niceness,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,3801,"['like', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'smart', 'funny', 'opinionated', 'things', 'even', 'when', 'disagree', 'still', 'seeing', 'what', 'up', 'be', 'stand', 'up', 'directing', 'new', 'movie', 'writer', 'director', 'Goldthwait', 'improved', 'dramatically', 'years', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'impressive', 'creative', 'achievement', 'even', 'do', 'quibble', 'one', 'premises', 'Bobcat', 'one', 'excellent', 'extras', 'film', '34', 'liberal', 'gun', '34', '34', 'call', 'kindness.', '34', 'agree', 'accounts', 'appreciate', 'fight', 'Goldthwait', 'wages', 'rampant', 'materialism', 'societal', 'ugliness', 'irresponsibility', 'narcissism', 'are', 'completely', 'valid', 'targets', 'satire', 'wry', 'cultural', 'commentary', 'Bobcat', 'excels', 'skewering', 'excesses', 'mostly', 'technique', 'mocking', 'reality', 'shows', 'here', 'are', 'thinly', 'disguised', 'counterparts', 'actual', 'televised', 'atrocities', 'e.g', '34', 'American', 'Superstarz.', '34', 'protagonists', 'Frank', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'Roxy', 'Tara', 'Lynne', 'Barr', 'have', 'had', 'enough', 'society', 'take', 'out', 'miscreants', 'one', 'jerk', 'time', 'wicked', 'killing', 'spree', 'Most', 'directed', 'reality', 'star', 'Chloe', 'awful', 'family', 'like', 'added', 'theme', 'political', 'right', 'key', 'underpinning', 'lack', 'civility', 'typical', 'xenophobia', 'oil', 'company', 'propaganda', 'masquerading', 'genuine', 'political', 'positions', 'news', 'stories', 'captions', '34', 'Tea', 'Party', 'Members', 'Assault', 'Parkinson', 'Sufferer.', '34', 'would', 'be', 'curious', 'how', 'many', 'producers', 'Hollywood', 'reality', 'so', 'well', 'are', 'Fox', 'News', 'acolytes', ""'m"", 'guessing', 'none', 'am', 'not', 'defending', 'likes', 'Sean', 'Hannity', 'here', 'can', 'defend', 'just', 'fine', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'Alan', 'Colmes', 'left', 'guess', 'Bobcat', 'missed', 'Keith', 'Olbermann', 'Chris', 'Matthew', 'venom', 'last', 'decade', 'so', 'Bobcat', 'welcome', 'make', 'political', 'point', 'course', 'movie', 'fair', 'point', 'out', 'philosophical', 'disconnect', 'arguing', 'reality', 'shows', 'popular', 'culture', 'are', 'making', 'US', 'meaner', 'country', 'believe', 'are', 'completely', 'agree', 'premise', 'way', 'blaming', 'wrong', 'side', 'political', 'fence', 'problem', 'rendering', 'plea', 'film', '34', 'right', 'wrong', '34', 'anymore', 'moot', 'film', 'climax', 'Frank', 'valid', 'criticism', '34', 'America', 'become', 'cruel', 'vicious', 'place', 'reward', 'shallowest', 'dumbest', 'meanest', 'loudest.', '34', 'completely', 'true', 'reality', 'television', 'have', 'stated', 'think', 'not', 'only', 'key', 'film', 'genuine', 'societal', 'concern', 'What', 'lost', 'vision', 'though', 'reality', 'television', ""n't"", 'reality.Having', 'explained', 'philosophical', 'differences', 'film', 'let', 'tell', 'why', 'liked', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'Camera', 'work', 'excellent', 'ambience', 'film', 'characters', 'sympathetic', 'deeply', 'sociopathic', 'crimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'positions', 'do', 'think', 'Goldthwait', '34', 'call', 'kindness', '34', 'odd', 'may', 'sound', 'given', 'context', 'brilliantly', 'written', 'excellent', 'points', 'American', 'pop', 'culture', ""'m"", 'glad', 'made', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'more', 'nuance', 'most', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'superior', 'interviews', 'are', 'golden', 'few', 'hidden', 'gems', 'emerging', 'see', 'Bobcat', 'explain', 'why', '34', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'sense', 'humor', 'Vulcan', '34', 'why', 'get', 'merkin', 'eyebrows', 'many', 'other', 'humorous', 'diversions.This', 'movie', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'loathe', 'reality', 'television', 'have', 'objection', 'satirical', 'violence', 'point', 'recommend', 'open-minded', 'viewers']",N/A

The whole plot and story, which revolved around a middle-aged man who is sick and tired of all the crass and vulgar content which passes itself of as ""entertainment"" nowadays and how Americans have become mean and lost their kindness and civility, sounds like my kind of movie. In the beginning I found the film funny and engaging, it was sharp and witty, if not a bit dark and disturbing, and the acting was fairly decent, however that all changed when he kills his first victim and Roxy enter's the picture. Now, a secondary character isn't bad in and of itself, and I wouldn't have minded if Frank had found a kindred spirit in Roxy, but to be completely honest, the character Roxy was very unlikable and in many ways represented all that is wrong with the youth of America, nowadays, she is incredible shallow, vulgar, and violent, and I have no idea why Frank even allows her to talk him into doing the things he does or why he even allows her to tag along on his killing spree. It is fairly ironic listening to her idiotic ranting on topics and people who aren't all that bad and certainly not ruining America or deserving of death, if anyone is truly deserving of death, it's her, as she is in no way above any of the people she cruelly judges. It is her character that ultimately brings the entire film down five stars to three. In all honesty, much of what God Bless America rails against and much of the things Frank says about modern American society, is spot on, and this is ultimately a very dark, almost depressing, but funny film. The media is saturated with sex, violence, cruelty, and stupidity, and many of the most vulgar, disgusting, mean-spirited, nihilistic shows and films are in fact the most popular and highest rated, it's actually kinda bizarre when you think about it. To be completely honest, America has NEVER been particularly known as one of the greatest places to live on this planet, even as early as the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Americans have been known for being more open, violent, and vulgar than Europeans, but it has now reached an all time low starting in the early 70's for the most part. And it only seems to be headed further down into the darkness, I wonder what sort of things my future kids will be exposed to, if I even have a TV when I'm raising my kids, I'm not entirely sure I will. The ending scene I feel was very symbolic of how the few people who are still decent, moral, and kind are slowly dying out, soon to become an extinct species if something isn't done about this mess of a society.

We reward the shallowest, the dumbest, the meanest and the loudest. We no longer have any common sense or decency. No sense of shame. There is no right and wrong.

Without exception every single one of these people have made a fortune from being mean and vicious.

It features an adult man and teenage girl presented as heroic anti-heroes who 'get even' for all the stupidity of some of the rankest pop 'culture' in the USA.  Yep, it's a sewerpipe straight from Hollywood (where else) spewing out murder spree after murder spree under cover of 'critiqueing' the sleaze present in the US culture.  Portrays anyone of a conservative bent a crazy hate-monger and the liberals are presented as idiots for the most part,but as mostly better people than the conservatives.  That's to make sure it doesn't offend the chief audience it will garner.  I really have no quarrel with the latter presentation, but the caricatures are so transperent it's foolish.  Anyhow, it's a good flick for ""male anger ventilation"" in the world of the imagination (possibly women too, but I'm not so sure).  But for anybody under 30 years old (maybe 45, maybe 50) it is a movie that shows the actualization of mass murder perpetrated on innocent citizens like we see happening in the news.  This stuff (these presentations) has/have been going on for years and people wonder ""What's wrong?""  ""Why would anyone do this?"" in reality.  I'll tell you why.  A good example is a Super Bowl commercial.  Why do they cost 50-60 million (or more) for 30 seconds of air time?  That's because television and movies ""really don't have an effect on anyone"" right?  Keep the sewerpipe open and prepare for more of the same in your daily news.  Don't go around wondering why this stuff happens.  It's not weapons or guns, it's Hollywood (or, the ""movies"" if you will).  They glorify the stuff.  Ain't no ifs, ands, or buts, about it.  Pretty good acting by the main guy.  The 'girl' does OK also.  Kinda has a pedophilic undertone at times, but mainly handles the two characters well in that regard.  They both have a certain conscience about some things.....so I hand them kudos for that.  But the rest - The movie should be released as Restricted to Audiences Over 50 Years of Age.  Let the sewerepipe roll on and quit blaming gun people (of which I am not one of) for the actual murders we are seeng in our society and put the blame where it belongs, Hollywood!  Have fun...I did!

The insipid, superficial nature of those around him, as well as the shallow attitudes of reality television celebrites, has caused him to become cynical and angry. The fact that his ex-wife and bratty daughter regard him as a loser does not help matters, and his belligerent and loud neighbors are constantly testing his patience. The next day, Frank is fired from his job, and shortly after, his doctor casually informs him that he has a terminal brain tumor. With very little hope for the future, Frank attempts to end his life.As Frank sits in bed in front of the television contemplating suicide, he catches a glimpse of a `Sweet Sixteen' reality television show, in which a young girl named Chloe spews profanities at her parents for buying her the wrong vehicle for her birthday. You see, Chloe wanted an Escalade, and her parents bought her a Lexus. The audacity of this young woman sets Frank off on a mission - a killing spree to rid the world of rude, insensitive jerks.The following day, Frank stalks the aforementioned Chloe and shoots her. He flees the scene, but a young woman named Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) witnesses the crime. She tracks Frank down, talks with him, and discovers that they have similar ideologies regarding their disgust with modern day culture. She convinces Frank to let her join him on his spree, and from there on, the body count continues to rise. It all leads to an explosive finale at an `American Idol' spinoff.As a satire, the film is quite effective, even if the script is occasionally brought down by rambling monologues that throw the film off balance. That isn't to say that these moments are without value; however, they feel a bit forced and unnecessary. Joel Murray gives a fantastic performance as Joel. This is a character that most of Goldthwait's audience will sympathize with to the very end. The stilted performance of Tara Lynne Barr as Roxy takes some getting used to. Her character can be quite grating at times, and you begin to wonder if the film would be better without her.Bobcat Goldthwait has evolved as a filmmaker, as he has proven with his previous feature, `World's Greatest Dad'. Aside from the weaknesses with the script, Goldthwait is in top form with `God Bless America', and I, for one, am looking forward to his next project.Rated R for strong violence and language including some sexual references. 105 minutes.

1536978,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B007REV6K0,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[2, 2]","This brilliant film is in the `Falling Down' genre, but is all about modern America or more correctly society and how it has gone south in the being nice and decent department. Frank has landed in middle age, he is divorced, has a daughter who would have been great in `The Exorcist', without coaching, neighbours that have taken `red neck' and made it their own, a job he gets fired from and his doctor has just told him he is going to die.As he contemplates not wanting to live he gets pushed over the edge by a reality TV show where a spoilt rich girl gets to be on prime time just because she is rich, pretty and a total biatch. So he drives down to where she is for some not so random justice. That is where he meets Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr) and she wants to join him in killing as many people as they can who, quite simply, deserve to die. When you start to think of the categories of people that fit into that, not so exclusive `death list, it actually become a big job. Frank is just tired of reality television, selfish, rude people, the right wing single issue politics and pure toxicity of the moronic pop culture that is ruling and ruining the world, and God bless him for that. She hates high fives, racists, homophobes and religious bigots, plus a few more that she can enunciate with the language of a street walker - brilliant.This is funny, intelligent, well acted and just a great ride. Joel Murray (`The Artist') is outstanding as Frank, the reluctant gun wielding guy, just asking people to be nice to each other. The soundtrack is great too with a lot of original material for the film, and it all hangs together brilliantly. Check out the end credits too where we have a credit to `Boy who gets shot in movie theatre # 2' and `Pancake eating pedophile' (sic), if that don't prove what a messed up work of genius this is, then I think nothing will.There is gore, there is swearing, there are serious issues and there is wanton murder, so if any of that floats your boat, then you should get yourself a copy of this superb film.

He is tired of reality TV, he gets fired from his job for looking up a co-workers address and just found out he has terminal cancer. He decides to end it all but right before he does he sees something on the TV that changes his mind. I must start by saying I loved this movie, but it is not for everyone. Bobcat is getting better and better as a director and writer. I have really like ""Sleeping Dogs Lie"" and ""World's Greatest Dad"" but I think that this is his best one yet. I can best describe this by calling it an extreme version of ""Falling Down"". Without sounding too un-PC or getting the FBI after me Frank in this movie does things some of us want to. Especially those who hate reality TV and are sick of the people on it. I am not advocating what is done in this but I did get a sense of relief knowing I'm not the only one. The acting is good but the writing is great. I highly recommend this but you must not be the type that offends easy. If you are and watch this...you were warned.

1536981,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B007REV6K0,Tsuyoshi,"[5, 6]","Frank (Joel Murray), a lonely middle-aged man, diagnosed as terminally ill, embarks on a mission to get rid of those who he thinks are responsible for the moral decline in our modern society. Then Roxy (Tara Lynne Barr), a girl who ran away from her home, joins his journey. Unlike in a certain Nicholas Cage film, they wear no mask or costume. Frank and Roxy are more like Bonnie and Clyde, though Frank looks much older than his counterpart.The best part of ""God Bless America"" is not the killing rampage by the incongruous pair, however; it is Joel Murray's subtle performance as Frank before he turns into a killer, as a decent person whose life is slowly falling apart. His ordinary life is made unbearable by the people around him in a plausible way. Dejected Frank turns on TV. All he sees there is stupidity.So far, the film is good. But once the protagonist starts killing, we feel something is not quite right with the film. I am not talking about moral codes. I know this is a comedy, or a satire. The problem is that the story is not just interesting. Their ""mission"" soon gets repetitious as ""God Bless America"" does not know where it is going.The film also fails to develop the characters of Frank and Roxy. What is their relationship like, for instance? Father and daughter? Partners in crime? Or Humbert Humbert and Lolita? We don't know. True, the movie is generally well-acted, but the direction is heavy-handed at times. We are not sure whether we should laugh or not when the protagonist starts rambling monologue about what he thinks deserves punishment. Are we supposed to laugh with him, or at him?And when he speaks, he speaks on and on, as if being the mouthpiece of the director Bobcat Goldthwait. Our hero's preachy attack on everything he dislikes (from ""American Idol""-type reality shows to Diablo Cody and those who overuse ""actually"" in their conversation) is not only unfunny, but annoying, making us think: ""If you don't like TV shows, why don't you stop watching them and read a book instead?""Maybe Goldthwait is aware of this. Or maybe not. What we know is ""God Bless America"" could have been a more insightful and funnier movie than it is, a one-note comedy of which second half drags.",3,"(2.5 STARS) One-Note Comedy That Has Much to Say, Little to Show",1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,2221,"['Frank', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'lonely', 'middle-aged', 'man', 'diagnosed', 'terminally', 'ill', 'mission', 'get', 'rid', 'who', 'are', 'responsible', 'moral', 'decline', 'modern', 'society', 'Then', 'Roxy', 'Tara', 'Lynne', 'Barr', 'girl', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'journey', 'certain', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'film', 'wear', 'mask', 'costume', 'Frank', 'Roxy', 'are', 'more', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'Frank', 'much', 'older', 'counterpart.The', 'best', 'part', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'not', 'killing', 'rampage', 'incongruous', 'pair', 'however', 'Joel', 'Murray', 'subtle', 'performance', 'Frank', 'killer', 'decent', 'person', 'life', 'slowly', 'falling', 'apart', 'ordinary', 'life', 'made', 'unbearable', 'people', 'plausible', 'way', 'Dejected', 'Frank', 'TV', 'stupidity.So', 'far', 'film', 'good', 'once', 'protagonist', 'killing', 'feel', 'something', 'not', 'quite', 'right', 'film', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'moral', 'codes', 'know', 'comedy', 'satire', 'problem', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'interesting', 'mission', 'soon', 'repetitious', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'not', 'know', 'where', 'going.The', 'film', 'also', 'develop', 'characters', 'Frank', 'Roxy', 'What', 'relationship', 'instance', 'Father', 'daughter', 'Partners', 'crime', 'Humbert', 'Humbert', 'Lolita', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'True', 'movie', 'generally', 'well-acted', 'direction', 'heavy-handed', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'should', 'laugh', 'not', 'when', 'protagonist', 'rambling', 'monologue', 'what', 'deserves', 'punishment', 'Are', 'supposed', 'when', 'being', 'mouthpiece', 'director', 'Bobcat', 'Goldthwait', 'hero', 'preachy', 'attack', 'everything', 'American', 'Idol', '-type', 'reality', 'Diablo', 'Cody', 'who', 'overuse', 'actually', 'conversation', 'not', 'only', 'unfunny', 'annoying', 'making', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'TV', 'shows', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'read', 'book', 'instead', 'Maybe', 'Goldthwait', 'aware', 'maybe', 'not', 'What', 'know', 'God', 'Bless', 'America', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'insightful', 'funnier', 'movie', 'one-note', 'comedy', 'second', 'half', 'drags']",N/A
