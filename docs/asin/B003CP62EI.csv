1336769,A12EJR997CZJH8,B003CP62EI,"Mike ""~Being humble keeps you honest""","[2, 3]","So I kind of consider myself a connoisseur when I comes to anime, being I've spent a good chunk of money on DVD's since I was in middle school. This Series was in my option what anime is really about, story.The interaction between the characters is very compelling and the plot did not fall short (such as with Claymore with the single revenge driven character, still a good show though). What really won me over was the relationships that developed between the characters. Each character helped move the story along even if they were only in the show shortly.*Warning- skip this paragraph if you haven't seen the show yet* I feel Possibly the best part about the sure is the relationship between Masane and Rihoko. The interaction was the perfect blend of comedy and drama. I personally cried when they were separated (I know, in touch with my sensitive side ^_^), however even with all the plot twist and the sometimes generic story this still was a series I felt was one of the best I had watch in a long time and loved everyone minute of it.For anyone who is a fan of shows like Samurai Champloo and Full Metal Panic! this is a show you'll definitely want to get your hands on.",5,Worth Every Penny!,1312588800,"08 6, 2011",2011,1181,"['So', 'kind', 'consider', 'connoisseur', 'when', 'anime', 'being', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'good', 'chunk', 'money', 'DVD', 'was', 'middle', 'school', 'Series', 'was', 'option', 'what', 'anime', 'really', 'about', 'story.The', 'interaction', 'characters', 'very', 'compelling', 'plot', 'did', 'not', 'fall', 'short', 'such', 'Claymore', 'single', 'revenge', 'driven', 'character', 'still', 'good', 'show', 'What', 'really', 'won', 'over', 'was', 'relationships', 'developed', 'characters', 'character', 'helped', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'even', 'were', 'only', 'show', 'shortly', '*Warning-', 'skip', 'paragraph', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'show', 'yet*', 'feel', 'Possibly', 'best', 'part', 'sure', 'relationship', 'Masane', 'Rihoko', 'interaction', 'was', 'perfect', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'personally', 'cried', 'when', 'were', 'separated', 'know', 'touch', 'sensitive', 'side', '^_^', 'however', 'even', 'plot', 'twist', 'sometimes', 'generic', 'story', 'still', 'was', 'series', 'felt', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'had', 'watch', 'long', 'time', 'loved', 'everyone', 'minute', 'it.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'shows', 'Samurai', 'Champloo', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'show', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'want', 'get', 'hands']",Witchblade Viridian Collection
