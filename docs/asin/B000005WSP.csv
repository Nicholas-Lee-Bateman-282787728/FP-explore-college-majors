He goes from &quot;True Lies&quot; to Fox Sports' talky sports TV show to late night guest appearances and manages to be entertaining at every turn in spite of his lack of talent (OK, marginal talent).But that's in supporting roles, or just being his bizarre self.  He is not made to carry a movie, and in &quot;The Stupids&quot; he is asked to do just that.  It's like taking a humorous &quot;Budweiser: True&quot; commercial and stretching that moment of humor into a 90-or-so-minute film.  Just doesn't work.The Stupids are a family, and they're not just stupid, they are CHEERFULLY stupid.  Delighted to be stupid.  Deservedly stupid.  Willfully, gloriously, hopelessly stupid.

492717,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B000005WSP,David Baldwin,"[0, 0]","People wonder what happened to director John Landis after his heyday in the Eighties.  In the Nineties he was making terrific films this one included that either nobody bothered to see or were mishandled by the marketing departments of their studios.  Before ""The Stupids"" Landis made a terrific screwball comedy send-up with Sylvester Stallone, ""Oscar"", and a great vampire flick, ""Innocent Blood"".  This is a terrific foray for Landis into the land of family filmmaking even though I thought the subplot involving international arms dealing may be a little intense for the tots.  The Stupid family isn't so much dumb as incredibly thick.  How anybody can concoct a plot to steal garbage and see something nefarious in undeliverable mail is downright inspired.  The Stupid family may be incredibly oblivious but the film is smart.  If it weren't the whole endeavor would go up in flames. It also helps that the Stupid family(Tom Arnold, Jessica Lundy, Bug Hall, and Alex McKenna) are impeccably cast and believable as a unit.  Terrific cameos by Jenny McCarthy and Bob Keeshan(Captain Kangaroo).  I remember this film being dumped into the marketplace over the Labor Day holiday in 1996.

492718,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000005WSP,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[1, 2]","The Stupids...is the family really as stupid as the film wanted me to believe?  In hopes that I could be more forgiving with the film because it's apt?  I like to make a brief analysis.Throughout ""The Stupids"", I saw the Stupid family dumbstrucked over their trash being stolen week after week, writing down basic words that would easily confuse a Stupid member when reading it, mishandling foods, pretending they're bushes until they actually think they are, believing their bikes got stolen when they're chained to a bus, going to a planetarium and think it's heaven and a janitor is Our Creator, and so forth.  Their actions indicate them as dimwits, but for dimwits, they sure are otherwise well-adjusted. The Stupid parents know how to drive a car and the Stupid children know how to ride a bike, they understand directions to where they wanted to go, speak eloquently, are aware about current technology, kept their house in place even if does look tacky, and know how to dress themselves properly; heck, the parents must knew how to 'get busy' if they have children.  For such a functional family to do idiotic things whenever a situation is given to them, I had to come to a conclusion that they're not stupid.  They're silly...or misguided anarchists, given the amount of zany damage they caused.I am rather astounded that big complain with ""The Stupids"" is that the family is not stupid enough, or rather I don't find their stupidity to be believable.  Genuinely stupid people are slow, basic and barely function as human begins; Forrest Gump is a likable example, and heck, Patrick Starfish is more believably stupid than The Stupids, and he's a sea creature.  The Stupids' antics are more childish and inane, which makes them unbearably not funny.  In fact, the real stupid people aren't The Stupids themselves but rather the people around them.  Characters that eat up their antics and following their vague assumptions without a single thought or reason, especially that one random scene where an audience is prancing to ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" by Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold), which is very haunting; the only 'smart' person of the movie is the postal manager who fired Stanley from his old job, but who was the one that hired him the first place, huh?  The villains are a big culprit of this incompetent circus as they follow all the worse cliches in the book, such as revealing their plans and making big speeches instead of shooting people.  To understand their purpose, the dimwitted convenient plot deals with Stanley being involved in a black market deal by an Army superior, thinkin' it has something to do with the conspiracy of his trash being stolen, and of course it leads up to his family inadvertently saving the---blah, if I want wanted to see idiots get caught in a terrorist plot without their understand, I'd see ""Beavis and Butthead Do America"".The bad guys try to kill Stanley, but he unknowingly overcame with dumb luck and ridiculous circumstances, such as car bomb that somehow explodes everything but the area where the character is.  It's like I'm watching a cartoon; heck, it even had stop-animation pets and aliens who planed to destroy the family.  What the heck am I watching?  The humor's just too goofy and pasteurized for any given adult, and I hate the running gag where the family stared at the audience and made kooky one-liners; that has never been a good gag.  I doubt even kids would find this funny, as there's just too much witty retorts for them to understand, and not much in the way of zany physical antics.  The only good thing this movie had going for itself is an imagination scene with Christopher Lee burning letters and stealing trash, if only because his theatrical acting actual made a dumb scene cool; two minutes out of a 94-minute waste of time.I could recommend good stupid movies, but I don't thinkthesefilmswould cater to the 'family-friendly' audience.  For that, I say families are better off watching 90 minutes of ""Chowder"" than this film.  Just because ""The Stupids"" is a family movie, doesn't mean it should treat the audience like cavemen.",2,Never stupid for the right reasons,1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,4113,"['Stupids', 'family', 'really', 'as', 'stupid', 'film', 'wanted', 'believe', 'hopes', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'forgiving', 'film', 'apt', 'like', 'make', 'brief', 'Stupids', 'saw', 'Stupid', 'family', 'dumbstrucked', 'trash', 'being', 'stolen', 'week', 'week', 'writing', 'down', 'basic', 'words', 'would', 'easily', 'confuse', 'Stupid', 'member', 'when', 'reading', 'mishandling', 'foods', 'pretending', ""'re"", 'bushes', 'actually', 'think', 'are', 'believing', 'bikes', 'got', 'stolen', 'when', ""'re"", 'chained', 'bus', 'going', 'planetarium', 'think', 'heaven', 'janitor', 'Creator', 'so', 'forth', 'actions', 'indicate', 'dimwits', 'dimwits', 'sure', 'are', 'otherwise', 'well-adjusted', 'Stupid', 'parents', 'know', 'how', 'drive', 'car', 'Stupid', 'children', 'know', 'how', 'ride', 'bike', 'understand', 'directions', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'speak', 'eloquently', 'are', 'aware', 'current', 'technology', 'kept', 'house', 'place', 'even', 'look', 'tacky', 'know', 'how', 'dress', 'properly', 'heck', 'parents', 'must', 'knew', 'how', ""'get"", 'busy', 'have', 'children', 'such', 'functional', 'family', 'do', 'idiotic', 'things', 'whenever', 'situation', 'given', 'had', 'come', 'conclusion', ""'re"", 'not', 'stupid', ""'re"", 'silly', 'misguided', 'anarchists', 'given', 'amount', 'zany', 'damage', 'caused.I', 'am', 'rather', 'astounded', 'big', 'complain', 'Stupids', 'family', 'not', 'stupid', 'enough', 'rather', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'stupidity', 'be', 'believable', 'Genuinely', 'stupid', 'people', 'are', 'slow', 'basic', 'barely', 'function', 'human', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'likable', 'example', 'heck', 'Patrick', 'Starfish', 'more', 'believably', 'stupid', 'Stupids', 'sea', 'creature', 'Stupids', 'antics', 'are', 'more', 'childish', 'inane', 'unbearably', 'not', 'funny', 'fact', 'real', 'stupid', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'Stupids', 'rather', 'people', 'Characters', 'eat', 'up', 'antics', 'following', 'vague', 'assumptions', 'single', 'thought', 'reason', 'especially', 'one', 'random', 'scene', 'where', 'audience', 'prancing', ""'m"", 'Own', 'Grandpa', 'Stanley', 'Stupid', 'Tom', 'Arnold', 'very', 'haunting', 'only', ""'smart"", 'person', 'movie', 'postal', 'manager', 'who', 'fired', 'Stanley', 'old', 'job', 'who', 'was', 'one', 'hired', 'first', 'place', 'huh', 'villains', 'are', 'big', 'culprit', 'incompetent', 'circus', 'follow', 'worse', 'cliches', 'book', 'such', 'revealing', 'plans', 'making', 'big', 'speeches', 'instead', 'shooting', 'people', 'understand', 'purpose', 'dimwitted', 'convenient', 'plot', 'deals', 'Stanley', 'being', 'involved', 'black', 'market', 'deal', 'Army', 'superior', 'thinkin', 'something', 'do', 'conspiracy', 'trash', 'being', 'stolen', 'course', 'up', 'family', 'inadvertently', 'saving', '-blah', 'want', 'wanted', 'see', 'idiots', 'get', 'caught', 'terrorist', 'plot', 'understand', ""'d"", 'see', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'Do', 'America', '.The', 'bad', 'guys', 'try', 'kill', 'Stanley', 'unknowingly', 'dumb', 'luck', 'ridiculous', 'circumstances', 'such', 'car', 'bomb', 'somehow', 'everything', 'area', 'where', 'character', ""'m"", 'watching', 'cartoon', 'heck', 'even', 'had', 'stop-animation', 'pets', 'aliens', 'who', 'planed', 'destroy', 'family', 'What', 'heck', 'am', 'watching', 'humor', 'just', 'too', 'goofy', 'pasteurized', 'given', 'adult', 'hate', 'running', 'gag', 'where', 'family', 'stared', 'audience', 'made', 'kooky', 'one-liners', 'never', 'been', 'good', 'gag', 'doubt', 'even', 'kids', 'would', 'find', 'funny', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'witty', 'retorts', 'understand', 'not', 'much', 'way', 'zany', 'physical', 'antics', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'had', 'going', 'imagination', 'scene', 'Christopher', 'Lee', 'burning', 'letters', 'stealing', 'trash', 'only', 'theatrical', 'acting', 'actual', 'made', 'dumb', 'scene', 'cool', 'two', 'minutes', '94-minute', 'waste', 'time.I', 'could', 'recommend', 'good', 'stupid', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'thinkthesefilmswould', 'cater', ""'family-friendly"", 'audience', 'say', 'families', 'are', 'better', 'watching', '90', 'minutes', 'Chowder', 'film', 'Just', 'Stupids', 'family', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', 'should', 'treat', 'audience', 'cavemen']",The Stupids VHS

The so-called ""bad"" acting is intentional (in fact, it's sometimes quite good bad acting), and yes, the characters are supposed to be stupid.  The humour comes from the dissociation between our ""normal"" view of the world and their continual misinterpretations of everything that happens to them, and the way that ""reality"" somehow always seems to support their misinterpretations.
