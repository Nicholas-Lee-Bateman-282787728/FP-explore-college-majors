1101399,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,B000VECAEO,calvinnme,"[48, 53]","Season nine starts where we left off the previous season, with George recovering from injuries he took down a flight of stairs, thus interrupting the ""Summer of George"" he was planning to enjoy with  his generous severance check from the New York Yankees. George quickly finds another job, but his potential new boss has misunderstood his cane, and before George can explain the boss tells George about all of the benefits he will enjoy as a handicapped employee. George decides to go along with the ruse when he discovers he will have his own specially outfitted bathroom to suit his handicap - a perk George cannot resist.  When George is found out by his employer and even offered another generous severance package to leave, he decides to dig in and the whole situation turns into a humorous seige. George never fails to offend and infuriate people, so later in the season when an acquaintance is working on step nine of the AA program by going around and apologizing for past transgressions George is unhappy that he is never apologized to. He agitates the acquaintance about this so badly that he does eventually get the apology. However, unfortunately now the poor fellow has an anger management problem on top of his alcoholism due to George and must enroll in still another support group.Elaine is in a longer relationship than usual, continuing her romance with ace auto mechanic David Puddy. The mismatched couple have as tortured a relationship as you would expect and in the opening episode are bickering during a plane ride all the way back from Europe where they have been vacationing. They break up but end up sleeping together every time they see each other. This works out for Jerry and for Puddy since Jerry keeps betting Elaine that she can't stay away from Puddy - and winning - and it turns out that Puddy likes not having to stick around to cuddle with Elaine afterwards.Although I have no idea how Kramer manages to live in Manhattan without any visible means of support, at least we finally discover why he has been unemployed. He's been waiting for the strike to end at H&H; Bagels for 12 years. The strike ends when the minimum wage finally reaches what the union demanded in the first place. Of course, Kramer is the only one of the strikers who has actually been faithfully striking all these years. When he decides to celebrate George's father's version of Christmas - Festivus - he wants the day off. When H&H; refuses Kramer goes back on strike because his religious beliefs are not being honored, thus ending Kramer's brief venture into the world of work.Jerry has numerous romantic misadventures this season including a girlfriend that looks either beautiful or hideous depending on what the lighting is, another girlfriend who likes to wander around sans clothing yet still manages to annoy Jerry when he discovers there is such a thing as ""bad naked"", and yet another girlfriend whom Jerry throws over for the sound of his own voice imitating the noises that the girl's stomach makes.This year has Newman making quite a few appearances, most notably in ""The Butter Shave"" where he discovers that he is strangely attracted to Kramer in a culinary way after Kramer uses butter as a tanning lotion and then falls asleep in the sun. That all-over butter smell is just too much for Newman to resist ending in a hilarious chase scene through the middle of Jerry's stand-up routine. Newman and Kramer are also featured in a satire of the X-Files when Kramer starts to complain about his junk mail to the post office and goes there to declare he no longer wants his mail delivered.The last four episodes - Puerto Rican Day, the two clip shows, and the finale were a bit of a let-down to me. Puerto Rican Day didn't seem to have the same level of ensemble humor I was accustomed to seeing, the clip shows are just bits and pieces taken from prior shows that were shown on the night the finale was broadcast, and the finale just didn't live up to my expectations. But then it would be hard to wrap up in one hour a show that spent nine years focused on the minutia of life as experienced by four self-involved people and somehow managed to never disappoint. It's hard to have a satisfying conclusion to something that had no real beginning or middle to it.

Many people who don't like Seinfeld don't appreciate how complex and well written the story lines can be.  The Betrayal (or Backwards episode) seems to be dreaded by many but is a favorite for me.  I see it as a well written and thought out episode that ventures into a much more daring style of writing.  Show me a movie or TV show that comes even close to this format (flashbacks DON'T count) and still maintains a funny and engaging plot.The final episode was a disappointment for me, and I will also admit that it fell short of the standards set by the previous episodes.  But I also applaud their ability to bring the show to a close and still incorporate so many of the extras that made appearances over the years.Though maybe not the best, this season is still one of the best of the Seinfeld show.

Season 9 however wraps up arguably the greatest show which has ever been on TV and although not quite as good, still has enough classic lines that you're going to want to finish off your Seinfeld collection with. You're also going to also want to do it while this season is still at normal prices and not at collectors ones.Season 9 for the most part maintained the high quality of the previous seasons with classic moments such as George's girlfriend saying no when he tries to break up with her, a bookstore making him buy and refusing to let him return a book he took into the toilet, he dates a woman who looks like Jerry and the George scenes which brought back flashbacks for anyone who was a kid in the 80s when he has to own the Frogger machine from a closing down pizza shop with his high score.  Elaine dates a homeless man, a boyfriend she wonders if is black before she reunites with Puddy who she discovers is religious and thinks she is going to hell but doesn't care, she also is tormented by a fax machine, plagiarises a newspaper cartoon and eats an historic piece of cake among a few adventures.  Kramer among other things turns his apartment into a movie set, moves to Seinfeld's parents retirement village in Florida, hides a safebox key inside a neighbours bird, takes up an acting gig in a hospital and steals police caution tape.  Jerry continues to find faults with the various women he dates including a sentence finisher and one with a secret tractor story as well as realising dating and paying his maid is not much different to using a prostitute.  The quality of the final couple of episodes is not quite up there with the rest of the series, it is almost as if too much effort was put into giving all the writers a go and trying to make these epidodes the best which only resulted in them being not exactly Seinfeldly in feel.Like with the other series the special features aren't as numerous in number or as good as they could have been. The deleted scene with the actor playing someone who had a sponge left inside of him is hilarious and should have been in the show.  As should have a lot of the deleted court scenes from the finale which could have maybe been there at the expense of the slow start to that episode.  Like most I thought the finale was a bit of a disappointment compared to my expectations but seriously I don't think it's possible to reach the expectations of the huge number of fans, interestingly in the scenes from the roundtable feature Larry David says he would do it with less hype if he could do it again. Just on that roundtable feature, I don't understand why they didn't include the whole show instead of a very edited version, especially since some of the stuff they kept was also told in the commentaries.  On the topic of commentaries I thought they finally got the balance right with the commentary on the Burning in relation to allowing you to hear the lines and at the same moment learn some facts (this one included Jason, Julia and the actor who played Puddy).  However the commentaries on The Maid and Puerto Rican Day by the writers was pretty average and mostly related to them telling you how good they were to come up with this or that idea and criticising Jerry for not including their ideas such as George finding out his name is really Georg when he brings his birth certificate to work.  I did like how one had the courage to criticise NBC and the politically correct nuts for not showing the Puerto Rican Day Parade episode on TV after it first aired just because a few people protested before it was even aired and they even knew what it was about.One of if not the best TV show ever!",4,"The Final Season May Not Have Been This Show's Best, But Compared to Other Programs, is Still Way Better Than Most of the Rest!",1207353600,"04 5, 2008",2008,3829,"[""'re"", 'only', 'going', 'buy', 'one', 'season', 'DVD', 'obviously', 'are', 'more', 'likely', 'find', 'more', 'favourite', 'classic', 'episode', 'moments', 'previous', 'season', 'collections', 'Season', '9', 'however', 'wraps', 'up', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'show', 'ever', 'been', 'TV', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'still', 'enough', 'classic', 'lines', ""'re"", 'going', 'want', 'finish', 'off', 'Seinfeld', 'collection', ""'re"", 'also', 'going', 'also', 'want', 'do', 'season', 'still', 'normal', 'prices', 'not', 'collectors', 'ones.Season', '9', 'most', 'part', 'maintained', 'high', 'quality', 'previous', 'seasons', 'classic', 'moments', 'such', 'George', 'girlfriend', 'saying', 'when', 'break', 'up', 'bookstore', 'making', 'buy', 'refusing', 'let', 'return', 'book', 'took', 'toilet', 'woman', 'who', 'Jerry', 'George', 'scenes', 'brought', 'back', 'flashbacks', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'kid', '80s', 'when', 'own', 'Frogger', 'machine', 'closing', 'down', 'pizza', 'shop', 'high', 'score', 'Elaine', 'homeless', 'man', 'boyfriend', 'black', 'Puddy', 'who', 'religious', 'going', 'hell', ""n't"", 'care', 'also', 'tormented', 'fax', 'machine', 'newspaper', 'cartoon', 'historic', 'piece', 'cake', 'few', 'adventures', 'Kramer', 'other', 'things', 'apartment', 'movie', 'set', 'moves', 'Seinfeld', 'parents', 'retirement', 'village', 'Florida', 'safebox', 'key', 'neighbours', 'bird', 'up', 'acting', 'gig', 'hospital', 'steals', 'police', 'caution', 'tape', 'Jerry', 'find', 'faults', 'various', 'women', 'including', 'sentence', 'finisher', 'one', 'secret', 'tractor', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'realising', 'dating', 'paying', 'maid', 'not', 'much', 'different', 'using', 'prostitute', 'quality', 'final', 'couple', 'episodes', 'not', 'quite', 'there', 'rest', 'series', 'almost', 'too', 'much', 'effort', 'was', 'put', 'giving', 'writers', 'go', 'trying', 'make', 'epidodes', 'best', 'only', 'resulted', 'being', 'not', 'exactly', 'Seinfeldly', 'feel.Like', 'other', 'series', 'special', 'features', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'numerous', 'number', 'as', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'deleted', 'scene', 'actor', 'playing', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'sponge', 'left', 'hilarious', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'show', 'should', 'have', 'lot', 'deleted', 'court', 'scenes', 'finale', 'could', 'have', 'maybe', 'been', 'there', 'expense', 'slow', 'start', 'episode', 'most', 'thought', 'finale', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointment', 'compared', 'expectations', 'seriously', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'possible', 'reach', 'expectations', 'huge', 'number', 'fans', 'interestingly', 'scenes', 'roundtable', 'feature', 'Larry', 'David', 'would', 'do', 'less', 'hype', 'could', 'do', 'again', 'Just', 'roundtable', 'feature', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'include', 'whole', 'show', 'instead', 'very', 'edited', 'version', 'especially', 'stuff', 'kept', 'was', 'also', 'told', 'commentaries', 'topic', 'commentaries', 'thought', 'finally', 'got', 'balance', 'right', 'commentary', 'Burning', 'relation', 'allowing', 'hear', 'lines', 'same', 'moment', 'learn', 'facts', 'one', 'included', 'Jason', 'Julia', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'Puddy', 'However', 'commentaries', 'Maid', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Day', 'writers', 'was', 'pretty', 'average', 'mostly', 'related', 'telling', 'how', 'good', 'were', 'come', 'up', 'idea', 'criticising', 'Jerry', 'not', 'including', 'ideas', 'such', 'George', 'finding', 'out', 'name', 'really', 'Georg', 'when', 'birth', 'certificate', 'work', 'did', 'like', 'how', 'one', 'had', 'courage', 'criticise', 'NBC', 'politically', 'correct', 'nuts', 'not', 'showing', 'Puerto', 'Rican', 'Day', 'Parade', 'episode', 'TV', 'first', 'aired', 'just', 'few', 'people', 'protested', 'was', 'even', 'aired', 'even', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'about.One', 'not', 'best', 'TV', 'show', 'ever']",Seinfeld: Season 9

The eight and ninth seasons of Seinfeld are really different from the others. In the first seven seasons, there was at least a little bit (very little bit) of genuine comradeship and affection between the maisn characters. After that, they become the real selfish and greed guys they became known for...Season Nine is good, but by any standards is far from great. (mainly when you compare it with the show's own very high standards!).There are uneven episodes, but none of them is bad by itself, and the show was far from jumping the shark. Maybe to avoid this at all costs was the reason why Jerry Seinfeld decided to call it a day (this, plus the fact that he was extremely tired from working on the show non-stop all that years - and the last two without support from David).As for the final episode, I tought it was very good and absurd like the show itself. As lawyer Jack Chiles says in his opening statement to the jury, the absurd of the trial is that the criminal itself (the guy who robbed the fat guy) is free and people's taxes are being thrown away trying to convict the four guys who did not help, based on some silly Good Samaritan law!

Like if it was targeted to Hispanics.Given the hard time that NBC got with the airing of the 'Puerto Rican Day' episode, one can hardly be blamed for suspecting that the ''ethnicity-selective'' anti-piracy commercial is just a ''shove it down your throat'' feature for customers who's vernacular language is not English.And for the record I am a Puerto Rican who happens to love the 'Puerto Rican Day' episode. Despite the burning of the Puerto Rican flag. And that is because throughout ''his'' series Mr. Seinfeld took the greatest comedic liberties with his own Jewish ethnicity, even in extremely sensible topics as the holocaust.But I can't help to deeply resent the ""pay back"" BS that either NBC or Jerry Seinfeld or both wants to shove down our Puerto Rican (nay, Hispanics) throats.

1101449,AY8WZDYR79GFV,B000VECAEO,Yasha Banana,"[6, 50]","I realize that ""Seinfeld"" is loved, adored, indeed *worshipped* by millions of people.  But phuleeeeze, you've got to be kidding -- ""Seinfeld"" is so lightweight it's embarrassing.  All four of the major performers are one-trick ponies: extremely one-dimensional.It's not that the show isn't somewhat amusing, it is.  But that's all it is, mildly amusing at best.One thing ""Seinfeld"" *does* have going for it is that most sitcoms nowadays are far WORSE -- incredibly mean-spirited which ""Seinfeld,"" thankfully, isn't.  ""Seinfeld"" is, if nothing else, a sweet, civilized, humane show, and that's rare nowadays.But that aside, the show is weaker than Johnny Fontaine's vocal chords.The funniest thing about ""Seinfeld"" is the laugh track.  Notice when the laugh track kicks in.  The laugh track is activated for lines that are either barely funny or else not funny at all.  Then, when there is a legitimate laugh, the laugh track gives the impression that an enormously funny thing has happened; which is rarely the case.Listen to how out of sync the laugh track is as compared with what a live audience would, in reality, laugh at.In many markets, ""Seinfeld"" reruns are followed by reruns of ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and the difference between the two shows is remarkable.  ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is light-years better than ""Seinfeld.""  It's better written, better acted, better directed.  The characters are fully conceived, and the stories are human, empathetic -- as opposed to ""Seinfeld's"" typically smug, condescending, smart-alecky point of view.So why is ""Seinfeld"" such a highly regarded sitcom?  Here are a few theories.Theory #1: People like ""Seinfeld"" because they're attracted to the idea of a friendly, likeable guy living in a big impersonal city who, nevertheless, opens his door to all kinds of goofy people.  This is also my theory as to why ""Friends"" and ""Cheers,"" two other lightweights, are also so popular -- friendliness amidst the anomie of the big city.All three shows are also heavy on ""relationships"" and ""lifestyles,"" especially relationships and lifestyles among singles.  And, God knows, people *do* need the maturity and intelligence of commercial teevee to clue them in on how to relate to people.  I imagine people see Elaine's ""relationships"" and say: ""Yeah, I guess that's how it's done.  Better check with Oprah though.  Get a second opinion.""Theory #2: Jerry Seinfeld is, in and out of character, an extremely likeable person, and on teevee that counts for a great deal.  As previously noted, one thing ""Seinfeld"" is *not* is mean-spirited; so the show scores points when compared to the harshly cynical junk that dominates teevee nowadays.  I don't watch ""Seinfeld"" reruns very much but when I do at least I know the show won't be cynical and mean-spirited, and that's an oasis in a desert of mean-spiritedness.Theory #3: Jerry Seinfeld is evil incarnate.  Diabolical fiend that he is, he's hypnotized America into liking not just him but his facockta show.  (Oh, and they thought we'd never find out!  J'ACCUSE, JERRY SEINFELD!)OK, let's consider each character, starting with Kramer/Michael Richards. ...I mean, come on, fellow bipeds, how many times is it funny that Kramer enters a room skidding across the floor?  Without a rigged laugh track and a bigoted stand-up routine, Michael Richards would be working for the post office, and *Josh Mostel* would be sliding across the floor.  At least THAT would be funny!Also, Mike baby, dig it -- Jerry Lewis did the spastic bit 50 years ago, and even then Jerry didn't drive it into the ground like you do.Elaine/Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. ...Pshaw and alas, very *very* limited.  Compare her to, say, Deborah/Patricia Heaton on ""Everybody Loves Raymond.""  Patricia Heaton can *act* comedically.  She *moves* comedically.  In fact, her physical humor is as good as that of any female comedian whose appeared on television.  Moreover, she can deliver long, plot-enabling monologues as good as anybody in either comedy or drama.  In short, Patricia Heaton along with the rest of the cast of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" can do all the things that nobody and I mean NOBODY on ""Seinfeld"" can do, least of all Julia Louis-Dreyfus-Head-Case.Which brings us to Jason Alexander ...His one-trick is that he whines.  Oy, can this boy whine!  This is some feency-schmancy whiner.  I want a million dollar whiner, this is who I go to.  I pray to God for a whiner: Jason Alexander falls from the sky into my lap.Virtually every one George Costanza's laugh lines is Jason Alexander whining.  Whine, whine, whine.  Enough already!  Enough already, I'm getting naaaauseous!There should be a character on ""Seinfeld"" whose sole job it is to *demand* that George Costanza stop whining.  In fact, if one of the characters in ""Seinfeld"" yelled at George Costanza, at the top of his lungs, ""STOP WHINING!"" -- there'd be a regular standing ovation three blocks long.The writers on ""Seinfeld"" are intelligent in that they know how to write for their characters -- one-dimensionally.  Unlike, the writers on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" Seinfeld's writers don't give their performers anything very difficult to do comedically.  And the reason is simple: the performers on ""Seinfeld"" are limited, as both actors as well as sketch comedians.The show had a very strict, very limited formula, which caught on with the public and, evidently, those associated with the show were content to work and prosper within those limitations.One senses that the ""Seinfeld"" writers understood quite well the actors' limitations and, as such, ""wrote-to-character"" with their limitations firmly in mind.Which, speaking of limitations, brings us to Jerry Seinfeld. ...The people who conceived the show (one of whom no doubt was Jerry Seinfeld himself) were very smart not to make Jerry Seinfeld play a character.  Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld and for a very good reason -- Jerry Seinfeld can *only* play Jerry Seinfeld.  In fact, even when Jerry Seinfeld plays Jerry Seinfeld, he isn't very good.  (Now THAT'S a limited actor!)Jerry's whining is, more of less, one octave lower than Jason Alexander's whining.  And, ok, so one's fat and the other's skinny, but so's my Aunt Shirley and Uncle Bernie, and where's their sitcom?The other thing that distinguishes ""Seinfeld"" as lightweight -- besides the rigged laugh track, the limited writing, and the low-grade talent -- is that a given show has a number of side-stories that invariably ""slam-cut"" across one another, the hoped-for-laugh being implicit in the juxtaposition of two story-threads suddenly coming together. ... Big deal.  Martin Scorcese watch out! ... This is as predictable as Kramer sliding into a room or George Costanza whining and kvetching, whining and kvetching.The use of several story-threads in each episode means that scenes are often short, quick and non-sustaining.  Jerry is, for example, standing outside his door saying goodnight to his date, there's a few back-and-forth lines, and then BAM! the camera cuts to, say, Kramer running down the street tripping over himself, and then BAM! over to Elaine and George trying to unlock her, I don't know, her chastity belt.All this suggests performers who can't otherwise sustain a ""comedy spine"" to a scene for more than a couple of minutes.  Notice, by contrast, how on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" a given scene is quite long, with often four or more actors in the scene.  ""Seinfeld"" a.) wouldn't dare film in front of a truly live audience, i.e., a live audience without a post production laugh track; and b.) keeps everything short and quick because short and quick creates a feeling of movement when the movement, the energy, should occur *within* the scene not against what comes before and after.It's not that there wasn't an audience present when Seinfeld was filmed.  Perhaps there was.  And, no doubt, some of the bits got legitimate laughs from the audience on hand.  But it's quite obvious that in post-production a laugh track was inserted to ""sweeten"" the laughs.  Meaning: a live audience with a laugh track inserted later on is, in reality, *not* a live audience, given the final product, given what's presented as ""the show.""As the great Sid Caesar said about his ""Show of Shows,"" a laugh track was out the question because ""that would be cheating.""Jerry Seinfeld, a self-professed admirer of the classic comedians, must, in his heart of hearts, be profoundly baffled as to why his show is so successful.  I doubt very much if he would disagree with the above-offered analysis.You've heard the expression ""dumbed-down""? -- I think what ""Seinfeld"" has done is to ""laugh-down"" the comedy of the show, that is to say, they've purposely made the comedy so bland and so predictable, so obvious and so formulaic that the show is, in effect, ""safely funny"" -- cute, predictable, and (financially) guaranteed.Kramer sliding.  ... George whining.  ... Jerry standing up straight.  ... Elaine trying to do God-knows-what, acting I suppose.  All this evidently pleases the people laughing on the laugh track, if not America's millions.But what's lacking?As much as Jerry Seinfeld, an admirer of great comedy, would like his show to be part of ""The Great Comedy Tradition,"" the truth is, the show falls way, way short of that lofty goal.All great comedy speaks to the human condition.  The audience, at some level, must be moved; must be made to look at the world and their place in the world ""with fresh eyes.""  The players have to be not just good comedians but also good actors.  They have to deliver not just cute, clever lines, they have to in some way move the audience ""to look at themselves.""For example, Alice Kramden gets mad at Ralph.  Her anger sets up the next joke, but her exasperation with Ralph also speaks to the human condition.  Ralph, alas, is a dreamer, a dreamer who always winds up losing; but although a loser, his wife  stand by him, loves him despite everything: the crummy apartment, the cockeyed dreams, the predictable failures.  We are moved by their love.  Secretly, we long for such unfailing love.  This requires a display of emotions on the part of the performers.  This requires acting!  (To quote that famous American philosopher Jon Lovitt.)Lou Costello makes us laugh, but he's also simpatico.  He is a fool in a world full of people far more clever than he is.  A fool in a world full of forces far too powerful, far too mysterious for one person to figure out, alone.  So he needs a partner, Abbott, to help him out.  The thing is, though, Abbott takes advantage of poor Lou as often as he helps him.  And so Costello is Everyman.  He is, perhaps, us, no?  This requires a display of emotions on Costello's part.  This requires damn good acting.Laurel and Hardy keep pushing that piano up the hill.  It keeps falling back. yet they still keep pushing.  They still keep truckin'.  They still keep keepin' on.  Why?  Why do they remain faithful to the life-force?  Why do they endure?  Why don't they just give up?  It's funny, yes, what they're doing, the audience laughs, but while they're making us laugh, we're also thinking to ourselves, perhaps not in so many words: ""This is The Myth of Sisyphus!  This is funny not just because these guys are doing funny things but because they're putting what they're doing within the context of the human condition, in this case the absurdity of life.  My God, the impossibility of it all! ... I dig it.""There is longing in Stan Laurel's face and exasperation in Oliver Hardy's sighs, both of which transcend comedy.  In short, we're not just laughing; we are, on some level, enlightened.Laurel and Hardy, Abbott and Costello, Charlie Chaplin, W.C. Fields -- all the great comedians are much more than merely clever: their futility, the utter hopelessness of their situation, moves the audience to think about something beyond the humor, beyond what's apparent.""Seinfeld,"" on the other hand, is completely devoid of emotions.  The material that's written for the performers doesn't require actors because it doesn't require emotions.  The ""stuff"" that's goes on in the show never rises above the merely clever; it's instead smart-alecky, ""look-at-how-smug-I-am"" ... nothingness.  Indeed, the creators of the show *brag* that the show is about nothing!  And, yes, that's exactly right, that's it in a nutshell: ""Seinfeld"" is empty humor.  And, with empty humor, we get empty humanity.Indeed, ""empty humor"" is an oxymoron.  If so-called humor is empty of human emotions, empty of humanity, then it's not really humor.  A while ago I saw a PBS special on Jewish humor and towards the end of the program a scholarly fellow came on and made a point that I've never forgotten; that, for me, explains a great deal about life and human nature.  He said: ""I don't know this for sure, but I have the feeling that the words 'humor' and 'humanity' have the same root because you can't have a sense of humor unless you have a sense of humanity; and vice-versa."" ... And that's what ""Seinfeld,"" along with a great many other modern-day attempts at humor, lacks: humanity.Notice how in ""The Honeymooners"" or in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" or in a Charlie Chaplin movie or in any classic comedy, notice how at a certain point a *seriousness* presents itself.  Often this seriousness takes the form of someone being hurt; for example, Deborah in ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is offended by a remark her mother-in-law has made; The Little Tramp has been rejected by his love-interest because of his downtrodden condition -- so that amidst the humor of the piece, a misunderstanding of sorts has taken place, and, as a result, someone in the story, someone we can identify with, feels abandoned, alone, unappreciated.  The performers at that point have to act their way out of the predicament, dealing with a problem comedically that can just as easily become tragic.  (Imagine, for example, if Deborah really *had* a mother-in-law like the one on the show!  Violence might easily replace comedy as a resolution.)""Seinfeld,"" needless to say, is light-years away from that kind of enlightened comedy -- the kind of humor that speaks not simply to the clever or the glib but, more inportantly, speaks to ""the human comedy,"" the human condition.  But how many people in the arts today *are* concerned about the human condition?  Chaplin was, Sturges was, Capra was, Orson Welles was, Mark Twain was; with lesser talents taking their cues from these giants.  That, ironically, may be why ""Seinfeld"" is  so successful: it's either what the American public wants or else what it's been forced to endure -- as Ernest Hemingway put it: ""nada y nada y pues nada.""There is no emotion on ""Seinfeld"" -- no simpatico, no humanity -- because the creators of the show decided that that's how they wanted to pitch their show to the American public.  And, bingo! they succeeded.  Cleverness and nothingness are, after all, what television nowadays is all about, no?  ""Seinfeld,"" in that respect-- smug, shallow, smart-alecky -- was a forerunner for the shows that came after that have even less quality and more shallowness; less talent and more smugness.I can't believe that any of the ""Seinfeld"" performers look at the show in reruns and say to themselves: ""Yeah, man, that was my best work!""  Or, ""Damn, that's the best writing I've ever performed!""Finally, and sadly, we must say something about Seinfeld after ""Seinfeld.""  Poor Jerry.  Poor, poor, poor-poor-poor Jerry Seinfeld. The Wandering Comedian. ...-- He produced and starred in a documentary, ""Comedian,"" in which he tells us how he created from-scratch, from Joke 1, a stand-up monologue.  (Yaaaaaaaaawn.)-- He did a voiceover for a character in an animated bee movie.  *And* we're told by Jerry, his-own-self, in interview after interview after interview, that he did ""exhaustive research"" for the part.  (Jerry, leave the bees, take the cannoli.)-- He went on David Letterman and stood up for his racist, anti-Semitic colleague Michael Richards.  (NOTE: a few months before he did his racist rant onstage, Michael Richards did an anti-Semitic number, too.)And so one must ask: whither doth thou goeth now, Jerry Seinfeldeth?  What's your next move, boychick?  Let's face it, what can you do now, limited that your talent is?  What can you do now that people won't finally catch on that ""Seinfeld"" was a fluke?When, oh when will you finally crack, Jerry Seinfeld?  When, no longer able to contain your guilt, will you go running naked through the streets of Beverly Hills screaming: ""I AM UNCLEAN! I AM UNCLEAN!  TAKE BACK THE MONEY, I AM UNCLEAN!""Such thoughts, no doubt, haunt Jerry Seinfeld.  I imagine he wakes up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, muttering: ""You mean, they actually paid me for all that cockin' around?  They actually PAID me?!""His wife turns to him: ""Jerry, please, not again.  Go back to sleep.  And stop whining one octave lower than Jason Alexander.  (Sheeesh!)  It was only a nightmare.  Not to worry, the money's still in the bank.""Jerry (to his wife): ""There's one born every minute, isn't there?""""Yep, every minute.  And two to take 'im.""",2,Phuleeeeeeze!,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",2008,17152,"['realize', 'Seinfeld', 'loved', 'adored', 'indeed', '*worshipped*', 'millions', 'people', 'phuleeeeze', ""'ve"", 'got',
