846397,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B0002VEPD0,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[27, 51]","This documentary is a lot more than just about the faith of President Bush, as it delves into the Constitution, and the myth of the ""separation of church and state"", which ""many people mistakenly believe is part of the First Amendment"", and goes back to many of the thoughts of our Founding Fathers, like John Quincey Adams, who said, ""The highest glory of the American Revolution was this: It connected in one indissoluble bond the principle of civil government with the principles of Christianity"", and that in 1782, Congress authorized the Holy Bible for use in our schools.The last few years have seen what appears to be a fear from the Left of any spiritual expression (unless it is called ""Wicca"" or some other New Age derivative), and socialistic and secular organizations like the ACLU have been seeking to strip the country of all traces of religion, while on the same stage of destiny, there is a president of genuine faith, who is trying to stem the tide of removing God from all things American, resulting in a genuine culture war, labeled in the recent 2004 election as a ""war of moral values"".As President Eisenhower is quoted as saying, ""Without God there could be no American form of government nor an American way of life. Recognition of the Supreme Being is the first...the most basic expression of Americanism"".Janet Parshall, author of ""Tough Faith"", well-spoken and intelligent, hosts this 70 minute film, which includes many interviews, among them the authors whose works this documentary is based on, David Aikman, who wrote ""A Man of Faith"", and Tom Freiling, author of ""George W. Bush on God and Country"". It also includes comments from ""the other side of the aisle"", including Al Franken, Richard Gere, and Ralph Nader.The early part of the film has re-creations featuring actors playing the Bush family, which give it a semblance of the stories on the ""700 Club"", but it also has some wonderful still photographs of the family when ""W"" was a youngster.It also informs us of the Presidential Prayer Team, which is a web site where we can link in cyberpace and pray for our leaders.There is much to appreciate in this documentary, which is finely crafted, with smooth editing, and the DVD ""Extras"" include lengthy interviews that were left out of the final cut.If you don't feel threatened by the tradition of religion that has been a part of the fabric of American life since its inception, this is an enjoyable, informative film, and makes good family viewing.",4,well made and informative,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2487,"['documentary', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'faith', 'President', 'Bush', 'Constitution', 'myth', 'separation', 'church', 'state', 'many', 'people', 'mistakenly', 'believe', 'part', 'First', 'Amendment', 'back', 'many', 'thoughts', 'Founding', 'Fathers', 'John', 'Quincey', 'Adams', 'who', 'said', 'highest', 'glory', 'American', 'Revolution', 'was', 'connected', 'one', 'indissoluble', 'bond', 'principle', 'civil', 'government', 'principles', 'Christianity', '1782', 'Congress', 'authorized', 'Holy', 'Bible', 'use', 'schools.The', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'what', 'be', 'fear', 'Left', 'spiritual', 'expression', 'called', 'Wicca', 'other', 'New', 'Age', 'derivative', 'socialistic', 'secular', 'organizations', 'ACLU', 'have', 'been', 'seeking', 'strip', 'country', 'traces', 'religion', 'same', 'stage', 'destiny', 'president', 'genuine', 'faith', 'who', 'trying', 'stem', 'tide', 'removing', 'God', 'things', 'American', 'resulting', 'genuine', 'culture', 'war', 'labeled', 'recent', '2004', 'election', 'war', 'moral', 'values', '.As', 'President', 'Eisenhower', 'quoted', 'saying', 'God', 'could', 'be', 'American', 'form', 'government', 'American', 'way', 'life', 'Recognition', 'Supreme', 'Being', 'first', 'most', 'basic', 'expression', 'Americanism', '.Janet', 'Parshall', 'author', 'Tough', 'Faith', 'well-spoken', 'intelligent', '70', 'minute', 'film', 'many', 'interviews', 'authors', 'works', 'documentary', 'based', 'David', 'Aikman', 'who', 'wrote', 'A', 'Man', 'Faith', 'Tom', 'Freiling', 'author', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'God', 'Country', 'also', 'comments', 'other', 'side', 'aisle', 'including', 'Al', 'Franken', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Ralph', 'Nader.The', 'early', 'part', 'film', 're-creations', 'featuring', 'actors', 'playing', 'Bush', 'family', 'give', 'semblance', 'stories', '700', 'Club', 'also', 'wonderful', 'still', 'family', 'when', 'W', 'was', 'youngster.It', 'also', 'Presidential', 'Prayer', 'Team', 'web', 'site', 'where', 'can', 'link', 'cyberpace', 'pray', 'much', 'appreciate', 'documentary', 'finely', 'crafted', 'smooth', 'editing', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'include', 'lengthy', 'interviews', 'were', 'left', 'final', 'cut.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'threatened', 'tradition', 'religion', 'been', 'part', 'fabric', 'American', 'life', 'inception', 'enjoyable', 'informative', 'film', 'good', 'family', 'viewing']",George W.

846400,A33TDRCKKOFB15,B0002VEPD0,Brian Covert,"[4, 9]","Watching this video, one is caught between the feeling of wanting to congratulate so many well-meaning, morally upstanding people for their religious faith in God and President, while at the same time wanting to dismiss this production as little more than cheaply made propaganda. I chose the latter, for the following reasons.The opening message at the very beginning of this program reads verbatim on the screen: ""This documentary was produced independently and without any input from the White House, the Bush Administration or the Bush/Cheney Election Campaign. It is based on independent research."" You know right there what you are in for. From the very first spoken words of the program to the very end, the blessed virtures of George W. Bush are extolled and all critics of Bush are lampooned and ridiculed. This program relied 100 percent on opinions of those close to Bush (including family) and/or those who greatly admire Bush, and no research source whatsoever -- outside of the Christian Bible -- was noted anywhere in this program. This film may have been independent, but it is very far from being unbiased and unprejudiced.Some people who are interviewed for this program, both the young boy and several other adults, appear as if they are reading from a script or being coached. In the ""extra interviews"" you can even hear the director calling ""Cut!"" from behind the camera.Also, I bought this program in part for its billing as ""An Alternative Program to 'Fahrenheit 9/11'."" The ""extra features"" listing on the back of the case includes ""Responses to 'Fahrenheit 9/11'."" I was curious as to what rebuttal this program was prepared to give for the popularity of filmmaker Michael Moore's movie. The fact is that only a couple of passing references to ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" appear throughout the whole main program and the extra interviews, covering no more than a few minutes of the entire DVD. One gets the strong idea that this self-described ""documentary"" was created quickly and cheaply to plug up the growing leaks in Bush's sinking credibility in the wake of  ""Fahrenheit 9/11's"" popularity around the world. This film, ""Faith in the White House,"" would absolutely fail to convince anybody not to watch Moore's movie. In fact, it will probably encourage them to watch Moore's movie out of curiosity, if nothing else.Then there is the content: George W. Bush is presented in this program as literally the Son of Man, and the rest of humanity is not to question his morals or his decisions. There is not one direct interview given in this program by anybody even mildly critical of Bush and his policies. The focus on Bush and his unshakeable religious faith in what he is doing is the focus throughout this program. Ours, as mortals, is not to question why. Never mind the utter corruption that runs rampant throughout this U.S. adminstration and its wars overseas.Also, the program was more than a little dishonest in not labeling as a ""re-creation"" or ""re-enactment"" those scenes that show the newborn ""baby George W"" (aka ""baby Jesus"") in the arms of his mother Barbara (aka ""Mary"") and lovingly supported by father George H.W. (aka ""Joseph"") at the baby's baptism. There was literally a halo around the head of the young boy George W as he refuses to go out and play with a friend and instead stays home to comfort his mother. Then, there is the cheesy-looking actor portraying George W the man (where did they get those eyebrows?) as he turns down the ""come-on"" of a female campaign staffer who was probably put there as a spy by another political party to destroy Bush's credibility (aka ""Eve"" tempting ""Adam"" with the apple). There is no line whatsoever drawn between the actual file photos and footage of George W. Bush, and the dramatic recreations of his life -- some of which are quite hilarious.The extra interviews don't do much better. Every single person, without exception, praises Bush for every single small act he undertakes and derides anyone else who may question Bush's motivations. One interviewee, for example, exclaims that Bush has quote-unquote ""an almost cosmic vision"" as president. Another interviewee lets a big one slip out when he notes that Bush's religious faith serves as the basis for how he would quote-unquote ""rule"" the country (not ""govern,"" but ""rule""). Are we to believe that America is the equivalent of the Kingdom of God on earth and George W. Bush is its ruler? All of the interviewees, who include George W's ""Uncle Bucky"" Bush, would certainly have viewers of this program think so.In the end, this ""documentary"" left me with one overriding, inevitable impression: that while many individuals in the U.S. are certainly good people, America as a society has lost its moral compass entirely. That is the real issue to be addressed here. Americans as a people have lost any moral high ground whatsoever and are in no position to be wagging their Bibles, crosses, dirty money, crooked little fingers or anything else at the people of the world -- certainly not at people far away in the Middle East but not even at people in nearby Mexico or Canada. Americans of all religious faiths and social backgrounds need to get their own moral house in order now, and leave the rest of civilization alone while they are doing so. Good luck America, and let us know when you are done.If you absolutely must watch this program, ""Faith in the White House,"" borrow it from a friend or acquaintance who owns it. Don't waste one penny on it. You'll only end up doing what many other Amazon buyers have done: reselling this new DVD back on Amazon as a used item at a much cheaper price. Which, when you think about, is the only moral thing to do.",1,"""Almost Cosmic""....or Just Plain Spacey?",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,5694,"['Watching', 'video', 'one', 'caught', 'feeling',

846401,A3EQQP0LD4Z375,B0002VEPD0,Dr. Lee D. Carlson,"[44, 86]","As the title of this work implies, this documentary attempts to give a general overview of role of faith in the Bush Presidency. It should be noted that the title does not indicate the nature of the faith, i.e. whether it is based on Christianity, Islam, Judaism, or the myriads of other religions in the world today. Therefore, it could be said that this work professes to a certain religious provincialism. Viewing it reinforces this opinion, as no attempt is made in the work to justify non-Christian influences in the Bush administration. It is the Christian faith, and that alone, that gives moral legitimacy to the Bush administration.There are some astounding historical inaccuracies in the work, such as the assertion that Bush, Lincoln, and Washington are the only presidents to have to deal with war on American soil. The War of 1812 is not included, during which James Madison was President, and during which one had fierce battles in Chesapeake Bay and New Orleans, and of course the burning of Washington D.C. (which provided motivation for the writing of the Star-Bangled Banner). This omission sheds serious doubt on the credibility of this work, but evidently its purpose was not to engage in objective and accurate historical studies, but to justify the presence of the Christian faith in the higher ranks of government.The narrator of this work asks the viewer to consider whether Bush is just another pandering politician paying lip service to the Christian faith. Every president the narrator claims has paid deference to and reference to God. She does not elaborate however, on just what the term ""God"" meant to each of these presidents. Their conception of God was highly variable, as a perusal of their speeches and writings will reveal. But the purpose of this work was not to engage in objective and accurate historical studies, but to justify the presence of the Christian faith in the higher ranks of government.That this work believes that the Presidency is a divine appointment is clear from listening to the narrator, and that religious moral clarity is essential in a President. This need is apparent if one observes how much the churches in America were filled after 9/11, says the narrator. She does not give statistical evidence for her claims of the degree of church attendance, but the purpose of this work was not to engage in objective and accurate historical studies, but to justify the presence of the Christian faith in the higher ranks of government.The narrator asks the viewer to consider whether a man of faith is more trustworthy as a President than one who is not (interestingly, she does acknowledge the possibility of a ""woman of faith""). President Washington is quoted as saying that one cannot govern without God and the Bible. This quotation (no references are given) illustrates the inherent bias in this work towards the Christian religion. Could an Orthodox Jew govern America sufficiently? How about a person of the Islamic faith?The Christian evangelist James Robison engages in frequent dialog throughout the work. Bush has deep convictions, he says, but he would not deliberately manipulate others, does not make grandiose claims about his faith, and believes strongly in the power of prayer (which Robison adds, he never tries to hide). In addition, much discussion is given of Bush's childhood, and it is apparent that this work believes that his childhood experiences are relevant to the evaluation of the character of Bush. The discussion is completely at odds with other commentaries on Bush's childhood, which paint a radically different picture of it: one of an absentee mother and an aggressive and sometimes sadistic young man.Bush, with the assistance of Billy Graham and James Robison, turned his back on his drinking habits and became a transformed person, according to the narrator. Prayer, she says, saved him from alcoholism. Other commentators, and some psychologists though, have pointed to the dangers of untreated alcoholism, and if their assertions are supported by evidence, it would become imperative that Bush seek medical treatment as soon as possible. Ironically, it is perhaps his faith that will dissuade him from seeking medical help, believing that he can deal with any personal afflictions via the ""power of prayer."" After all, Bush says, faith can change our culture, give us purpose, and change lives. The daily workings of his administration exemplify his convictions in this regard, for Bible readings and prayer are part of the daily routine at the White House. ""I could not do my job without prayer"", says Bush.Thanks to Bush's emphasis on the Christian faith, all Christians can now be emboldened, says the narrator. His faith encourages all Christians to be open about their faith. That many Christians in the United States are emboldened is perhaps beyond dispute, and they are determined to bring about what they believe should be a more ""Christian America"", this being justified by the real intentions of the Founding Fathers.These are developments that must be watched carefully by anyone desired to live in a free and open society, and also from a pragmatic point of view. The issues facing each citizen of this planet justify careful thought and respect for facts, not prayer. With respect to the behavior of many citizens after 9/11, it could be said that the last thing one needs in time of crisis is prayer. The ratio of prayer time to thought time should be a very small number, as the time spent on prayer could be more wisely devoted to policy making and evaluation. Religion must not be a personal crutch, as it seems to be for Bush. He apparently does not have the personal strength or a powerful enough intellect to deal with his own problems and the important problems of his Presidency. Robison quotes him as saying that God wanted him to run for the Presidency, that his country was going to need him.But we need more thinking, not prayer.",2,Historically inaccurate and

Whenever US had some fine president, they got him killed like Kennedy, or impeached like Clinton, and then think that someone no woman would like to fool around with will be up to the job. The father's limitation was he couldn't do two things at the same time (for example stepping down some stairs and chewing gum). I was not sure the son can even do one only thing at all, but now I am, except anyone thinking that getting US down the drain can be regarded as a great achievement (except for those who still believe God is really pleased with suffering, and who were many enough to ask for four more years in misery). But, at least, this family is faithful to their beliefs, since the son could not think of anything else but to resume the war started by the father, and, this time, only demonstrating that it's the sheer opposition of two fanaticisms resulting from the complete dedication in superstitions based on dogmas they pretend to be religions.

It's the only way to explain his obsession with wealth. A true Christian would give to the less fortunate, not send them off to die in a war to make him more money.
