1337541,A3AQWDB4DSL9NP,B003DYFYFQ,Hot to Trot,"[2, 3]",I first saw this on regular TV many years ago.  It just recently became available on DVD.  The serious and often sad subject of divorce is woven into an interesting story revolving around well-developed characters that you can empathize with and care about.  There are also moments of humor such as when Haid's character sics the family Bassett Hound on his estranged wife.  I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good entertainment.,5,"Selleck, Curtin and Haid at at their best",1301961600,"04 5, 2011",2011,447,"['first', 'saw', 'regular', 'TV', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'recently', 'became', 'available', 'DVD', 'serious', 'often', 'sad', 'subject', 'divorce', 'woven', 'interesting', 'story', 'revolving', 'well-developed', 'characters', 'can', 'empathize', 'care', 'about', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'humor', 'such', 'when', 'Haid', 'character', 'sics', 'family', 'Bassett', 'Hound', 'estranged', 'wife', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'interested', 'good', 'entertainment']",N/A
