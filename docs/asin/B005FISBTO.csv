Do you delve deeper into Dexter's improbable path towards some form of redemption? Do you develop other characters in the story to give the story depth and greater personal drama? Well, the writers for season 6 have managed all of the above and more. I was very pleased with season 6 and as usual was left wanting more.

1457931,A1PJX7Y2V3SICE,B005FISBTO,AndreaF,"[29, 33]","Some spoilers!I really love Dexter and, like many other reviewers, have been a fan since the first season.  I think that seasons 1-5 are all rated 5-stars and that the entire cast is great, especially MC Hall, who displays some of the most intense acting chops of any actor, ever.  The writing of the previous 5 seasons has painted a vivid picture of Dexter and his fellow characters, and we know them well.  The various antagonists have always been written brilliantly and the actors chosen have been outstanding in their roles (I'm talking to you, Trinity!).I didn't feel quite as strongly in love with Season 6.  While I agree that the show's regular cast members maintained their 10-star acting performances (J Carpenter!!), and I loved the Brother Sam storyline and Quinn's meltdown, I thought that there were two problems with this season:1. Writing quality.  What the HECK was this season about, really?  Was it about Dexter and God?  Dexter and the Doomsday Killer?  Dexter trying to exorcise everyone of their Dark Passengers, like some quixotic archangel?  Dexter going crazy (hello, Rudy, I missed you)?  Dexter skipping work and being too busy to spend time with his son?  Dexter the Amateur, making mistakes left and right (having poison gas reaction, still attempt to get bad guy -or- oops, someone took my son!)?  Why was Dex sometimes written as a bit of an airhead, instead of being focused and precise?  Was it an attempt to show his personal battle of Good v Evil?  If so, I had too many ""wait, what?"" moments (random Midwest bathroom sex with a stranger) to fully appreciate that particular storyline.And the most creepy and eyeroll-inducing aspect of the season... Deb tacitly being given permission to be in love with Dexter, regardless of their lifelong brother/sister relationship, by her one-note shrink.  Ugh.  I hope that was just a momentary lapse that will be ignored (like Rita's kids) in Season 7.2. Colin Hanks was, to me, a confusing choice of an actor for such a major role on the show.  I think I understand the premise behind the choice; namely, they wanted an actor who was able to look innocent and gullible so that he could ultimately have the audience bamboozled.  Instead, this audience-member was bamboozled by the fact that they chose an actor who couldn't live up to the role and reputation of a Dexter foe.  In other words, I thought young Hanks was a dud.  Sorry, but I have to agree with other reviewers who've said the same thing.  I also think that Edward James Olmos was under-used.In all, I think that this season was ""okay"", but hope the writers stop trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to the characters - especially Dexter, who should be developed as a better, and more intense, main character instead of going backwards.  However, as usual, I still can't wait for the next season to start!",3,Love Dexter!

1457935,A1DZU4AQR7KD9R,B005FISBTO,"Axton Blessendon, Jr.","[3, 4]","I am in total agreement with other reviewers who were angry about Showtime's HORRIBLE promotional montage at the start of each and every disc in this 4-DVD set. I am not a fan of network montages to begin with (they're just tacky and overly-obvious and as a consumer I don't get much out of them) but usually you can skip past them and get to the menu of the show you're watching, no biggie.Not this time.For some reason, Showtime and/or the DVD manufacturers decided to bake the Showtime promo into their menu in such a way that there is no way to skip it -- you can't fast-forward, you can't skip to ""next"", you can't go to Menu, and you can't even hit ""stop"" and then start again to get to the Menu functions.  That sucks.  As a consumer THE VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY LAST THING I WANT IS NO CONTROL OVER MY VIEWING EXPERIENCE.I had planned to give this a DVD a decent review, the four or five stars it deserved on content alone. But then I saw that other customers had blasted it for the DVD menu, and since the real reason I wanted to review this disc was because I wanted to complain about the forced montage viewing, I realized that an ""unfair"" one-star review was more appropriate: this is a protest vote. If DVD sales are impacted by these low, negative reviews, and if that's what it takes to get Showtime's attention, so be it.Dear Showtime: if you have a good product -- a well-written, well-produced, well-acted show -- then people will buy it. But if you treat customers like babies and force them to watch lame promotional videos that NO ONE WANTS TO SEE, then you will alienate your fans. I am a fan. I like DVDs, not downloads. But if in the future every Showtime series has a forced-viewing feature like this, you will lose my business. Just saying.

1457938,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B005FISBTO,barry,"[0, 0]","I have been a huge fan of DEXTER right from the beginning of the very first season.  It is a show that fully pulls you in and has a premise much deeper than the simple description of blood analyst by day/serial killer of those worthy by night.  This show really gets into the mind of Dexter and we get to fully understand how he became the way he, why he does what he does and also understand his reasonings.  DEXTER is one of the best shows out there  and though this season, the sixth, is not totally up to par with the better seasons, it is still better than most television out there.The blu ray presentation here is amazing as all the seasons are.  The black/white ratio is excellent and colors are bright and vivid and pop.  Skin tone is very realistic and clarity is amazingly precise.  The darker scenes are just as vivid as the beautiful Florida scenery shots.  Add to the almost perfect 1080p video a Dolby Tru-HD 5.1 audio that is sublime and you have the best viewing experience possible.  Dexter's voice overs come out the speakers strong and present.  The rest of the dialogue is crisp and clear as well.  And surround speakers are put to great use here.  There is much action with season 6 and at the right moments all speakers are utilized for utmost effect.My opinion on season 6 has changed greatly from my opinion after watching it air last season.  Upon first tv viewing I found the season a little lackluster but was totally enthralled by the character Brother Sam played by Mos Def and found the ending an excellent unexpected twist that definitely made the whole season make sense and also sets up season 7 expertly.  Season 6 is primarily about Dexter facing the issue of religion especially in regards to what he wants to teach his son Harrison.  The Doomsday Killer is the evil entity this season and with first viewing it didn't seem fully effective to me.  The first 8 episodes were fine but the next 3 seemed to loose steam before the final explosive excellent episode.  After a reviewing of the season on blu ray I now can honestly say everything about this season was excellent and it was all held together as always by the presence and superb acting of Michael C. Hall as Dexter.  The entire reason this season seems a little subpar is the casting.  DEXTER has always cast the perfect people from Jimmy Smits to John Lithgow.  Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks just don't cut it here and the entire season is brought down a bit from it.  The story line of religion is a good one and it is handled well here as we see Dexter struggle with it.  Mos Def as Brother Sam brought a superb depth but the growing horror and suspense in the later episodes here totally lacked in true intensity due to Colin Hanks just not being able to handle the characterization he was given.  Luckily, Michael C. hall runs the show and each episode still rings true due to him.  Season 6 also has added emotional depth and intensity due to the welcome development of Debra, Dexter's sister played superbly by Jennifer Carpenter.  She has always been a major player in the show but this seasons her role becomes eve more complex and imoportant.Bottom line, DEXTER is such a great show that each season will have much discussion of how it held up to the others.

1457942,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B005FISBTO,B. Martin,"[0, 0]","I have to wonder if my overall enjoyment of the latest season of Dexter was dampened thanks to spoilers that were made available online before this season even made its dvd/Blu-ray debut.  I won't spill the beans on the plot twists that lie in wait for viewers (if there are any out there who don't know what happens at this point), but I suspect that even if they were kept under wraps, it still wouldn't have been enough to keep season six from being the weakest batch of espisodes yet.Relligion is a major theme as the city of Miami is terrorized by a duo of murderers known as The Doomsday Killers (Edward James Olmos, Colin Hanks) due to their religious zealotry and biblical themed killings.  Olmos and Hanks play teacher and pupil working together to stage murders that serve as tableaus of scenes from the Book of Revelations.  They believe that they are carrying out God's work which in this case is to prepare humanity for the end of the world.  Yet there is never a sense of urgency or fear to the crimes.  There is never a sense of city wide panic that is supposedly being caused by these crimes.  This is a crucial stumbling block since this poltline truly needs to provide an undercurrent of terror and suspense to the season.Season six also stuffs some filler plotlines into the narrative that never really go anywhere.  Most notably, Dexter tracks down a geriatric former serial killer known as the Tooth Fairy.  In another less than satisfying plot development, Laguerta becomes involved in a political quagmire with her chief.  Again, it doesn't really add a lot to this season.Still, there is a lot to like about this latest season.  The performances are strong as usual, with the exception of Hanks who feels woefully miscast.  Especially good is Jennifer Carpenter as Debra who has to deal with a lot this season including a breakup with Quinn and a prmotion to Lieutenant which comes with all sorts of political trappings. Mos Def is also exceptional as Brother Sam, a refomred convict who has devoted his life to God and tries to help Dexter come to terms with the darkness within him.  And of course, the season ends with one heck of a twist that sets up what will likely be the producers' end game.No, season six is not perfect but it is still worth watching.  And it ends by leaving viewers with the hope that the momentum of that final scene will propel the series to a worthy conclusion.  That would make the shortcomings of this season all but forgotten.",3,This Is How The World Ends,1348099200,"09 20, 2012",2012,2483,"['have', 'wonder', 'overall', 'enjoyment', 'latest', 'season', 'Dexter', 'was', 'dampened', 'thanks', 'spoilers', 'were', 'made', 'available', 'online', 'season', 'even', 'made', 'dvd/Blu-ray', 'debut', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spill', 'beans', 'plot', 'lie', 'wait', 'viewers', 'are', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'point', 'suspect', 'even', 'were', 'kept', 'wraps', 'still', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'enough', 'keep', 'season', 'six', 'being', 'weakest', 'batch', 'espisodes', 'yet.Relligion', 'major', 'theme', 'city', 'Miami', 'terrorized', 'duo', 'murderers', 'known', 'Doomsday', 'Killers', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'due', 'religious', 'zealotry', 'biblical', 'themed', 'killings', 'Olmos', 'Hanks', 'play', 'teacher', 'pupil', 'working', 'together', 'stage', 'murders', 'serve', 'tableaus', 'scenes', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'believe', 'are', 'carrying', 'out', 'God', 'work', 'case', 'prepare', 'humanity', 'end', 'world', 'never', 'sense', 'urgency', 'fear', 'crimes', 'never', 'sense', 'city', 'wide', 'panic', 'supposedly', 'being', 'caused', 'crimes', 'crucial', 'stumbling', 'block', 'poltline', 'truly', 'provide', 'undercurrent', 'terror', 'suspense', 'season.Season', 'six', 'also', 'stuffs', 'filler', 'plotlines', 'narrative', 'never', 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'Most', 'notably', 'Dexter', 'down', 'geriatric', 'former', 'serial', 'killer', 'known', 'Tooth', 'Fairy', 'less', 'satisfying', 'plot', 'development', 'Laguerta', 'involved', 'political', 'quagmire', 'chief', 'Again', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'lot', 'season.Still', 'lot', 'like', 'latest', 'season', 'performances', 'are', 'strong', 'usual', 'exception', 'Hanks', 'who', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'Especially', 'good', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Debra', 'who', 'deal', 'lot', 'season', 'including', 'breakup', 'Quinn', 'prmotion', 'Lieutenant', 'sorts', 'political', 'trappings', 'Mos', 'Def', 'also', 'exceptional', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'refomred', 'convict', 'who', 'devoted', 'life', 'God', 'tries', 'help', 'Dexter', 'come', 'terms', 'darkness', 'course', 'season', 'one', 'heck', 'twist', 'up', 'what', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'producers', 'end', 'game.No', 'season', 'six', 'not', 'perfect', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'leaving', 'viewers', 'hope', 'momentum', 'final', 'scene', 'will', 'propel', 'series', 'worthy', 'conclusion', 'would', 'make', 'shortcomings', 'season', 'forgotten']",N/A

We have Dexter, on one hand, chasing down two religiously motived serial killers, played by Colin Hanks and Edward James Olomos.  On the other hand, we have Dexter's soul being recruited by a Brother.  Dexter goes to Brother sam's seaside services, watches his baptisms, befriends him and so forth. While he's attending services, the other two are busy setting up religious tableaus with dead bodies.  The best of these is mounting a corpse as one of the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse and having it ride through the streets of Miami! All of the actors doing these roles are great.Another great is Dexter' sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) who is promoted to Lt. and has to see a police mandated shrink due to the shooting she did while on duty.  She dumps Quinn, who has become a mess and a drunk. She doesn't talk about him in therapy though.  She talks about Dexter and her therapist thinks she is in love with Dexter!  She is such an unlikely therapy subject that it is fun to see her in this process and what it does to her head with the ""in love with Dexter"" suggestion.Lt., now Capt., Maria LaGuerta (Lauren V&eacute;lez) is her usual ambitious self. Never has a police person had so little talent for police work and so much talent for police politics.  It's a miracle Debra hasn't shot HER. This is a character you love to hate.  She is now divorced from Angel but he is stuck with Quinn as his partner.Dexter and Debra also have their late father's ghost lingering in the Miami PD but only Dexter can see him.Vince has forensic trainees this season and they start off with a bang with one stealing body parts to put on ebay.All in all, a very enjoyable season, as usual.  Jeff Lindsey, author of the novels, releases his newest novel at the same time.  The novels have only Dexter, Debra and a very few other characters in common.  Lindsey rarely kills off any of the characters so those who have been dead for ages on the show are alive and well in the novels.

It was embarrassing to watch him try so hard and so unsuccessfully to be a convincing bad guy.  He simply pouted a lot, like a petulant little boy.  Who on earth was responsible for that casting?  And there was no consistency to his character.  He was ridiculously wishy-washy.  And even after the ""twist"" was revealed, and the wishy-washiness made at least a small bit of sense, that didn't change the fact that all of the preceding episodes were deadly dull.The whole over-arching religion theme of the season was incredibly heavy-handed, ridiculously smack-you-in-the-face.  A theme should play out naturally and subtlely in a story.  It shouldn't be clunkily imposed on every last facet.I understand that a show must keep changing (and hopefully evolving), but the whole (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Debra in love with Dexter idea was ridiculous.  That is the sort of idea that a dying show uses (unsuccessfully) to create shock and drama.I also agree with numerous other reviewers about the ads for other shows, as well as for the next season of Dexter, that you can't forward past.  And yes, especially the fact that the very last (shocking?) seconds of Season 6 are shown in a preview for Season 7.  Truly unbelievable.",2,Soooo Disappointed,1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,1872,"['have', 'been', 'huge', 'Dexter', 'fan', 'first', 'season', 'Loved', 'show', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'successive', 'new', 'season', 'come', 'out', 'DVD', 'season', 'So', 'boring', 'Oh', 'wait', 'Not', 'boring', 'BORING', 'First', 'foremost', 'killing', 'duo', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'absolutely', 'put', 'sleep', 'dullest', 'murderous', 'duo', 'ever', 'show', 'created', 'most', 'fascinating', 'psychopaths', 'history', 'television/movies', 'pairing', 'accompanying', 'writing', 'were', 'shockingly', 'bad', 'actors', 'scared', 'least', 'Not', 'one', 'moment', 'did', 'seem', 'believable', 'killer', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'particular', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'watch', 'try', 'so', 'hard', 'so', 'unsuccessfully', 'be', 'convincing', 'bad', 'guy', 'simply', 'pouted', 'lot', 'petulant', 'little', 'boy', 'Who', 'earth', 'was', 'responsible', 'casting', 'was', 'consistency', 'character', 'was', 'ridiculously', 'wishy-washy', 'even', 'twist', 'was', 'revealed', 'wishy-washiness', 'made', 'least', 'small', 'bit', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'preceding', 'episodes', 'were', 'deadly', 'dull.The', 'whole', 'over-arching', 'religion', 'theme', 'season', 'was', 'incredibly', 'heavy-handed', 'ridiculously', 'smack-you-in-the-face', 'theme', 'should', 'play', 'out', 'naturally', 'subtlely', 'story', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'clunkily', 'imposed', 'last', 'facet.I', 'understand', 'show', 'must', 'keep', 'changing', 'hopefully', 'evolving', 'whole', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'Debra', 'love', 'Dexter', 'idea', 'was', 'ridiculous', 'sort', 'idea', 'dying', 'show', 'unsuccessfully', 'create', 'shock', 'drama.I', 'also', 'agree', 'numerous', 'other', 'reviewers', 'ads', 'other', 'shows', 'as', 'well', 'next', 'season', 'Dexter', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forward', 'past', 'yes', 'especially', 'fact', 'very', 'last', 'shocking', 'Season', '6', 'are', 'shown', 'preview', 'Season', '7', 'Truly', 'unbelievable']",N/A

1457958,AQLPABVVH2WF7,B005FISBTO,Daniel S Tommie,"[24, 41]","I've given you a full couple weeks to be ready for this. I'm going to talk about the recently ended season of Dexter. There will be spoilers. Oh yes, there will be spoilers. As a primer, you may want to look at what I've already said of this season, here.As far as seasons of Dexter go, this the sixth season I feel was middling. But I think even a middling season of Dexter is still a strong contender for your TV viewing time. Thinking back on this season it feels a lot happened, but not a whole lot of much importance. The big bad was interesting, and there was some intriguing development going on outside of the main arc, but a lot of the rest of what happened either hasn't come to fruition yet or is all sound and fury.So lets start by looking over some of the key B plots, then we can end big by looking at the big bad and the finale.LaGuerta, as always, is looking out for LaGuerta. She and Angel have divorced in between seasons, their marriage may have been as legitimate as a Kardashian's, once it stopped paying off for her it was time to call it quits. In typical fashion, she was able to blackmail her way into a promotion to captain. Just as things seemed to be coming up all LaGuerta her maneuverings were stymied a touch as Deborah was promoted into her vacated position rather than Angel as she had planned. The only really important things to take away from this is Deb is now LT and LaGuerta is a hardcore manipulative bitch. Both of things will continue to effect the season and onward.Quinn and Deb are still a thing. For about an episode anyway. Then he has to ruin it all by doing something as silly as propose. They break up and she becomes his boss. Quinn being the rational adult he is handles it quite well as step by self destructive step he fills his life with booze and whores. Being the consummate professional these habits never effect his work life, except for every time we see him, all culminating to Angel nearly getting killed.Masuka continues to be your comic relief. And now he's got college students. It's a surprise to no one that he offers his intern position to the class sexpot. Neither should his advances on her be much of a surprise. What may have been surprising is her reciprocation. Also that she stole a key piece of old evidence, namely the mannequin hand from the Ice Truck Killer case. Sexpot is let go, and Masuka drafts Louis to fill her shoes, and cover up her theft, a task which he conveniently proves to be very adept at.That's when the Louis thread slowly starts to get a little weird. He starts to date Angel's sister Jamie the uber-sitter, good on `im, we learn he's developing a Serial Killer video game, oh and he has the mannequin hand. Dexter berates him for wasting his life creating such a sick piece of software. Dexter's words have something of an effect on Louis, but I'm not sure if I've decided what exactly he's playing at. He shelves the game, devotes himself to working for the department, and anonymously mails the hand to Dexter, but not before drawing deliberate palm lines on it. This is actually one of the items I'm curious to see handled next season, as Dexter never has a chance to see the hand before the events of the finale. I don't have much of a clue as to what it's supposed to mean, and I am left to wonder if Louis' change of heart stems from him being suspicious of Dexter.Dexter finds religion. Well, not in the way you're thinking, but religion permeated this season in an odd way. Dexter decides he should enroll his son Harrison in a Catholic preschool. This plan hit a minor speed bump when the school finds Dexter is completely without faith, but our favorite vigilante is able to overcome such minor details. Dexter makes a new friend in reformed criminal turned man of god Brother Sam. Brother Sam was a brief source of light and hope to Dexter, who encouraged him to find the good in himself. What light he kindled was exterminated when Sam came to an untimely end. Things never end well for friends of Dexter. And of course there was the overtly old testament nature of the Doomsday Killer, our big bad, but we're not quite there yet.Deborah, after involvement in a shootout, seeks some mandated counseling. She does her time, but discovers herself unraveling and issues pouring out of her into her therapist. May be that after all she's been through she needs some therapy. Her big breakthrough might not be what you'd expect. Turns out she's in love with her adoptive brother. Makes a sort of sense, really, everyone she's ever been with has either been very much like Dexter or very much not Dexter. Also keep in mind he is her adopted brother. So it's okay to think this is hot.The Doomsday Killer. As far as big bad's go, this season's was one of the more interesting. And likely the most insane, though not at first glance, and Doomsday evolved in unexpected ways. In the beginning we had a duo of religious zealots working to bring the end of the world by reenacting biblical passages in gruesome tableaux. Honestly, the dynamic between master and pupil was different at first as we've never been shown a team of killers but seemed a little uninspired. They seemed a little wooden. I can't tell you if that was by design or not.Then we had the student questioning his master, and the righteousness of their cause. Things started getting a little more interesting here as you could see that Travis was losing faith in Gellar and it was only a matter of time before he defied his dark master. Dexter was more than willing to help. In Travis, Dexter saw a chance he never had in himself. If Dexter could kill Gellar while Travis was still innocent, he could rid Travis of his Dark Passenger in a way Dexter could never be rid of his.But, in one of this show's greatest twists, we see Travis is a one-winged angel, and is quite insane. Gellar has been dead for some time, by Travis' hand, and Travis has been single-handedly working to bring about the doomsday since day one.In the final moments of the season Travis ends, of course, on Dexter's table as the show delivers on a promise made several times over several seasons. Deborah walks in on him in the midst of a kill, and as they see each other the season ends with us having to wait nine months to see what unfolds.As Dexter seasons go, I'd rate this the 3rd best, of 6.3 out of 5 justifiable homicides",3,"Dexter Season 6, in review",1326067200,"01 9, 2012",2012,6370,"[""'ve"", 'given', 'full', 'couple', 'weeks', 'be', 'ready', ""'m"", 'going', 'talk', 'recently',

Obraztsov,"[147, 181]","UPDATE: This review is about the show itself, not the hackjob that Showtime did to the DVDs/Blu-rays, giving away the ending in the first two minutes.Finally, Dexter has to to confront religion.  Remember season 1, episode 1, where Dexter was murdering his first victim (that we saw), who was praying for help, and Dexter said, ""That never helped anyone.""?  Well, that same Dexter, the same serial killer, now has a son about to go off to school, and he has to make some major decisions in his life.  Will he raise his son as a religious, Catholic boy?  Does Dexter himself need to further explore his own faith and beliefs?  Dexter truly becomes interested in religion in this season.  What does it mean?  Why do people worship a God?  And why should Dexter, a serial killer, have any kind of faith in a higher power?  These are all questions that Dexter explores this season with the aid of his growing son, his sister, Brother Sam, and the major storyline (Doomsday Killer).I watch a lot of true crime television, and I know that there are and have been plenty of serial killers who led normal lives on the side and shocked people when they were eventually discovered.  I am always curious as to the emotions that go through their head and what drives them, and Dexter kind of gives us a glimpse into that.  While of course the show is highly overdramatized for the sake of entertainment, there are flashes of real raw emotion from Dexter that makes me shudder and think, ""there's a serial killer.""Like I said, this season is obviously focused on religion.  Dexter develops an odd bond and curiosity/suspicion with Brother Sam, a murderer/drug addict turned priest.  Brother Sam claims that God helped him ""ease his dark passenger,"" I guess you'd say, and Dexter becomes extremely interested in whether or not this is possible for himself.  Also, Dexter's sister, Debra (played by Jennifer Carpenter), is AMAZING this season.  She finally decides to open up to people, and her emotions are so raw, intense, and real.  Debra seriously wants to learn more about Dexter and become closer to him, and that is a recurring theme throughout the season.The main killer in this season is the Doomsday Killer, who especially targets women based on biblical text.  This is another method that forces Dexter to confront his feelings on faith and religion.  He even bluntly asks Batista, completely serious, why he believes in religion.  Dexter never really thought of these things before, but now with a son, he feels societal and fatherly pressure to make changes.Next season, please!",5,Dexter is Forced to Confront Faith,1323561600,"12 11, 2011",2011,2576,"['UPDATE', 'review', 'show', 'not', 'hackjob', 'Showtime', 'did', 'DVDs/Blu-rays', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', 'first', 'two', 'minutes.Finally', 'Dexter', 'confront', 'religion', 'Remember', 'season', '1', 'episode', '1', 'where', 'Dexter', 'was', 'murdering', 'first', 'victim', 'saw', 'who', 'was', 'praying', 'help', 'Dexter', 'said', 'never', 'helped', 'anyone.', 'Well', 'same', 'Dexter', 'same', 'serial', 'killer', 'now', 'son', 'go', 'off', 'school', 'make', 'major', 'decisions', 'life', 'Will', 'raise', 'son', 'religious', 'Catholic', 'boy', 'Does', 'Dexter', 'need', 'further', 'explore', 'own', 'faith', 'beliefs', 'Dexter', 'truly', 'becomes', 'interested', 'religion', 'season', 'What', 'mean', 'Why', 'do', 'people', 'worship', 'God', 'why', 'should', 'Dexter', 'serial', 'killer', 'have', 'kind', 'faith', 'higher', 'power', 'are', 'questions', 'Dexter', 'season', 'aid', 'growing', 'son', 'sister', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'major', 'storyline', 'Doomsday', 'Killer', '.I', 'watch', 'lot', 'true', 'crime', 'television', 'know', 'are', 'have', 'been', 'plenty', 'serial', 'killers', 'who', 'led', 'normal', 'lives', 'side', 'shocked', 'people', 'when', 'were', 'eventually', 'discovered', 'am', 'always', 'curious', 'emotions', 'go', 'head', 'what', 'Dexter', 'kind', 'glimpse', 'course', 'show', 'highly', 'overdramatized', 'sake', 'entertainment', 'are', 'flashes', 'real', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Dexter', 'shudder', 'think', 'serial', 'killer', 'said', 'season', 'obviously', 'focused', 'religion', 'Dexter', 'odd', 'bond', 'curiosity/suspicion', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'murderer/drug', 'addict', 'turned', 'priest', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'God', 'helped', 'ease', 'dark', 'passenger', 'guess', ""'d"", 'say', 'Dexter', 'extremely', 'interested', 'not', 'possible', 'Also', 'Dexter', 'sister', 'Debra', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'AMAZING', 'season', 'finally', 'open', 'up', 'people', 'emotions', 'are', 'so', 'raw', 'intense', 'real', 'Debra', 'seriously', 'learn', 'more', 'Dexter', 'become', 'closer', 'recurring', 'theme', 'season.The', 'main', 'killer', 'season', 'Doomsday', 'Killer', 'who', 'especially', 'targets', 'women', 'based', 'biblical', 'text', 'method', 'Dexter', 'confront', 'feelings', 'faith', 'religion', 'even', 'bluntly', 'Batista', 'completely', 'serious', 'why', 'religion', 'Dexter', 'never', 'really', 'thought', 'things', 'now', 'son', 'societal', 'fatherly', 'pressure', 'make', 'changes.Next', 'season', 'please']",N/A

Yeah, we get it, LaGuerta is evil, Deb is nosey, Joey is a drunk, Batista is a goody-good, etc.  We've seen this stuff played out over and over.

This evolved to where there were circumstances where he had to kill the killer to protect his identity or where he delayed in order to learn from another serial killer. That is all gone in this season. Dexter chooses to suppress evidence because he _wants_ get to the killer before the police.The Colin Hanks character is an inadequate villain, both in what the script gave Hanks to work with and what he brought to it. The character isn't interesting -- he lacks intensity and smarts, and didn't even rise to the level of ""the banality of evil"".The religious theme - the intended point-counterpoint for the season - is provided with neither the detail nor the conviction needed.Missing are the clever twists and turns, although there are some wobbles. But mostly it is a tired procedural. I found multiple sections to be tedious. And too many elements that were repeated from earlier season apparently only out of inertia. And the new side plots ranged from insipid to annoying.Too much of the plot depends on the characters doing stupid things and failing to take normal actions (details would be spoilers).One of the underlying themes of the series is a highly dysfunctional person fighting to hide it and appear to be absolutely normal, with ""normal"" being counter-pointed by characters who are quirky (short of dysfunctional). This season has the Dexter character being the normal, well-adjusted, emotionally stable, responsible person surrounded by characters who are relentlessly dysfunctional. This might be the basis for a different series (a sitcom?), but it is not ""Dexter"".""Dexter"" is about being clever and skewed, but this season was just hackneyed.-- Douglas B.

Maria LaGuerta (Lauren V&eacute;lez), now divorced from Sgt. Angel Batista (David Zayas), has become a Captain, Dexter' sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) has a falling out with Quinn (Desmond Harrington) and becomes the new Lieutenant, taking LaGuerta's old spot, and Dexter (Michael C.

(except Brother Sam didn't say ""ef"")DEXTER's Season Six gives you the awesome and gives you the suck. I do feel that this is the weakest season in the series. Not that I'll ever stop tuning in; I'm addicted to this show. Only, I'd never seen Edward James Olmos sleepwalk thru a role before. Even Steven Wright thinks Olmos is too understated.Catching up with our favorite serial killer: All is well in Dexter Morgan's corner of the world. He's moving on from his wife's bloody murder and from Lumen's abandoning him. He's very much a caring single parent - his kid's two now - and his job as blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro PD is fulfilling. And then there's his hobby... he hasn't given up gratifying his Dark Passenger. But Dexter's got his s*** together. As Season Six opens, he's off to attend his 20-year high school reunion. There, he busts a move to M.C. Hammer and plays flag football. He even gets lucky. But who're we kidding? Dexter is attending his high school reunion to target his next victim. Life is good for the Bay Harbor Butcher.This is the season wherein Dexter starts exploring religion. The charismatic Mos Def plays Brother Sam, murderous ex-con turned man-of-the-cloth who walks into Dexter's life and befriends him. Dexter is initially skeptical and dismissive and even targets him as a potential kill. But there's something about Brother Sam. Has he really turned a new leaf? Can he teach Dexter about the nature of faith? Mos Def turns in a mesmerizing performance.Even as Dexter seeks religious enlightenment, Miami Metro PD's Homicide Division investigates a series of grotesque killings that immediately assumes biblical connotations. How long before Dexter's spiritual quest collides with the Doomsday Killer's apocalyptic mission?This show has always been deliberately messy, but, yikes, the creep factor is off the chain this season. It's hard to pin down Colin Hanks' character. He's uneasy in his own skin. He's at war with himself, his reasoning self versus his very own Dark Passenger. However, I found myself wanting to skip ahead whenever the camera shifts to his and Olmos' narrative. Their dialogue is so heavy-handed. They just don't measure up to the show's past villains. Lithgow has set such lofty standards, it's ridiculous. Even Jimmy Smits from Season 3 brought a more commanding presence.Okay, off the top of my head, the unsatisfying stuff (and there's quite a bit): I didn't like that Louis the intern's arc never really goes anywhere. We have to wait until Season 7 for that to play out. In fact, even the blonde intern's arc pretty much fizzled early in the season. And ***Mild SPOILERS*** now for the rest of this paragraph: I wasn't buying it when the detectives insisted on waiting for Dexter before entering a crime scene. This allowed Dexter to be the first to step into the room in which the Doomsday Killer had drawn Dexter's likeness on a mural painting of the Devil. Needless to say, Dexter promptly made some cosmetic changes. With a hammer.And it's convenient, isn't it, that Angel Batista's sister had moved in next door to Dexter, this making it easier for Dexter to land a babysitter anytime he had to step out?And then there's that shift in Dexter and Deb's relationship, predominantly from Deb's perspective. It's a stunning revelation and it's cheapening. It undermines what has been a constant strength of the show: Dexter and Deb as a dysfunctional brother and sister pair who screws up a lot but nevertheless cares deeply for each other. This monumental reveal feels a bit insulting, as if the writers all of a sudden determined that the preexisting family dynamics weren't enough to anchor the show. That, more than anything else, is what's disappointing.I think whenever religion is introduced as a central theme, there's a concern that the tone may take on a certain heavy-handedness. Again, the scenes between Hanks and Olmos did nothing for me. There's also that telegraphed and pretty played-out plot twist concerning Olmos.I do like that Deb's arc plants her and the self-promoting LaGuerta more firmly in the spotlight. I love Jennifer Carpenter's rawness, her evocation of a broken but resilient woman. David Zayas is solid as Batista. He projects quiet reserves of strength. The show's weak link,Desmond Harrington's Detective Quinn, continues to be the poster boy for super-bland bad boys. C.S. Lee's lecherous Masuka keeps making me laugh. Michael C. Hall keeps doing the improbable, making his serial killer a lovable character. His inner monologues continue to make for a fascinating listen.Other folks had already mentioned this, but here it is one more time, just in case... Be aware that each of the 4 discs starts with a 2-minute promo that showcases several Showtime programs. Be aware that you cannot fast forward thru this promo or skip ahead to the menu. About a minute in, this promo reveals the shocking last scene of Season 6's final episode. It's a moment that fans had long been salivating for, and it just about salvages the entire season for me, a season which, by the way, feels more like a set-up for the next season. But now here's me backing down. As critical as I've been, I still love this show, love the cast, love the premise, love the final episode's jaw-dropping closing moment. So, 3.5 out of 5 stars for DEXTER Season 6.Anyway, the 12 episodes are on 4 discs, with Disc 4 containing these following bonus features:- Interviews with Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, C.S. Lee, Colin Hanks, and Desmond Harrington- Text Biographies- Photo Gallery- HOUSE OF LIES - episodes 1 & 2",4,Can Mos Def redeem Dexter's soul?

I particularly loved the duality of the DK and the eventual revelation of his true identity.  Still there were some plot turns left hanging (the delivery of Lewis' present to Dexter), which is not unusual for this show as it seems to make a habit of occasionally taking the viewer down a dead end story line (why was Quinn being investigated by IAD in Season 3?).  Loved seeing Rudy, aka Brian Moser, back in town!  The conclusion, however, was a huge disappointment.  I am sooooooo sick and tired of all the Harrison crap -- that stupid brat should have been crucified by DK, a la Russell Crowe's son in Gladiator.

The LONG Showtime promo at the beginning of each disc (the same one by the way, repeated) with an imposed inability to skip it is despicable.  That being said, Season 6 is not that bad but what limits the show from being great is the supporting cast.  Their characters are bland, predictable and developed and manipulated to fit a given storyline.  Further, (opinion only) they are just not good actors, or perhaps it's because Michael C. Hall is so good that he makes them look bad.  All of them, Jennifer Carpenter included, would be better at home on a daytime soap opera.

1457997,A27W5AJNP6YX7Z,B005FISBTO,"Ivy Bewley ""Hiedra""","[2, 3]","I am soooo conflicted. I was so mad at Dexter (the character, that is) at the end of Season 4. Then in Season 5, they resolved nothing!!! Then I found out they had renewed it to Season 8! I was like, what the heck. How long can this possibly go on? Dexter has got to get caught sometime. Well, this season kind of redeemed itself.My problem is still that Dexter does not seem to be following his ""code"" anymore. He is not going after killers who fell through the cracks. He is purposely messing up police investigations and crime scenes just so he can get to the killer first! The big issue is... what happens when the killer just disappears? I guess the cops just forget they'd been working on the case for months and move onto the next one, right? And no closure for any victims. That's how it all happened before.Well, despite that, something about this show was fascinating enough that I watched all 12 episodes in 2 days, even though Dexter's technique made me furious. Even though I hate unnecessary sex and language (and this show really overdoes it), I am addicted to this show. (Showtime: just because you CAN do it doesn't mean you HAVE to.) The thing I liked best about this season was that Dexter finally seemed to be finding a new path in life. Not that it went that well. I'm not religious myself, but it sure was an interesting direction for the show and the character!Like I said, I am so conflicted. Sometimes I love this show, and sometimes it just infuriates me. I've been borrowing it from the library and I keep changing my mind about whether I want my own copies. (Maybe this will be the one set I can buy the complete collection of all at once.) One thing is for sure: after the way this season ended, we at least know Season 7 will have a purpose.P.S. After reading some other reviews, I sure am glad I am in the habit of sticking the DVD in my player while I leave the room to get my dinner. I cannot believe they put a spoiler to the ending in their shameful Showtime promotion! (I was already irritated with their un-fast-forward-able previews from previous seasons, so luckily I didn't accidentally see it on any of the discs.) And the ending was a surprise.

People have said this is the religious season of Dexter and that he is looking for answers to many questions that he is pondering.  But as normal for me I will give you guys and ladies highlights and a few spoilers of the season six.  Season starts off with a bang with Dexter killing people, then is called to a crime scene and they have to open up the victim to see what is inside his stomache(buy the season to see for yourselves).  Debs personal life gets in way of her work after she is offered a promotion to boss.  Musuka gets a helper for this season and he proves to be up to no good (have to buy the season to see what I mean).  The cops get a lead on the religious killers going on the book of revlations and refer to as doomsday killers, Dexter ask God for a favor for his son.  Dexter starts to figure out the names of the killers and tries to hunt them down, Sam gives Dexter advice on how to let go of the darkness within his heart and try to forgive.  Dexter listens to the advice of Sam and forgives himself for the death of his brother Rudy.  Sam leaves Dexter his Bible and Dexter starts to read it looking for answers, then he finds a lead and goes to an old church to find the killers.  Deb making headway in theorpy and Dexter figures out the next victim of the killers, as season goes on Dexter fixes out Travis is working alone and the other killer is already dead.  Travis tries to send in a follower to do God's will, then Travis tries to kill Dexter in a religious mannor called the Lake of Fire but of course he survies.  Travis comes up with a final plan to do the sacrifice unless Dexter stops him,  he of course finds Travis and they fight then Dexter takes Travis to the church and choices to do what he does best to bad people, only one thing goes horribly wrong(you have to buy the season six DVD set to find out).

The show keeps going on and on and the writers keep coming up with more serial killers and more scenarios for Dexter. Dexter is always one step of his pals at Miami Metro when he conducts his own investigation. Dexter could be the Sherlock Holmes of Miami if his obsession didn't have a macabre tone.Rocky relationships are always at the heart of Dexter. LaGuerta and Batista, Debra and Quinn, and Dexter and everyone. The relationships are so intertwined and involved. It's hard to imagine how Miami Metro ever solves a crime. Season 6 seems creepier and more gruesome that any others. Dexter is evolving and beginning to be curious about religion and faith as he enrolls Harrison in a Catholic pre-school. It's perfect timing as Miami's newest serial killings appear to be religious in nature and based on the Book of Revelation and the Apocalypse.Edward James Olmos as Professor James Gellar and his dedicated student Travis Marshall played by Colin Hanks are this seasons diabolical killers. They become known as the Doomsday Killers (aka DDK). Things are more serious as these killers think they are following the word of God. One of the creepiest murders is related to the Four Men of the Apocalyse. You have to see it to believe what the writers have come up with on this one.Dexter's mptivations and religious ambiguity are tested when he meets Brother Sam played by Def Mos. Brother Sam is a reformed ex-convict and drug addict who has seemed to have found God. Could be be the Doomsday Killer or has he really repented and switched to a life of doing good?  A lot of questions are raised in this season's episodes.Even Debra begins to question her exact feelings for her adopted brother Dexter.In pure Dexter classic form, this season is full of surprising plot twists and our Dexter continues to survive near fatal escapades and still stay ahead of his Miami Metro coworkers. Miami must be one dangerous city with all the serial killers running around every year. There also must a lot of open cases in Miami as Dexter finds and disposes of the killers just as Miami Metro is steps away. The killers are never found so do the good people of Miami live in fear? Fortunately, DEXTER is a writer's fantasy and the show just keeps us addicted to the story.",5,A DEXTER ADDICT TO THE END,1346025600,"08 27, 2012",2012,2402,"['strange', 'be', 'fascinated', 'show', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'serial', 'killer', 'something', 'addicting', 'DEXTER', 'show', 'going', 'writers', 'keep', 'coming', 'up', 'more', 'serial', 'killers', 'more', 'scenarios', 'Dexter', 'Dexter', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'pals', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'when', 'own', 'investigation', 'Dexter', 'could', 'be', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'Miami', 'obsession', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'macabre', 'tone.Rocky', 'relationships', 'are', 'always', 'heart', 'Dexter', 'LaGuerta', 'Batista', 'Debra', 'Quinn', 'Dexter', 'everyone', 'relationships', 'are', 'so', 'intertwined', 'involved', 'hard', 'imagine', 'how', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'ever', 'crime', 'Season', '6', 'creepier', 'more', 'gruesome', 'others', 'Dexter', 'evolving', 'beginning', 'be', 'curious', 'religion', 'faith', 'Harrison', 'Catholic', 'pre-school', 'perfect', 'timing', 'Miami', 'newest', 'serial', 'killings', 'appear', 'be', 'religious', 'nature', 'based', 'Book', 'Revelation', 'Apocalypse.Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Professor', 'James', 'Gellar', 'dedicated', 'student', 'Travis', 'Marshall', 'played', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'are', 'seasons', 'diabolical', 'killers', 'become', 'known', 'Doomsday', 'Killers', 'DDK', 'Things', 'are', 'more', 'serious', 'killers', 'think', 'are', 'following', 'word', 'God', 'One', 'creepiest', 'murders', 'related', 'Four', 'Men', 'Apocalyse', 'have', 'see', 'believe', 'what', 'writers', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'one.Dexter', 'mptivations', 'religious', 'ambiguity', 'are', 'tested', 'when', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'played', 'Def', 'Mos', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'reformed', 'ex-convict', 'drug', 'addict', 'who', 'seemed', 'have', 'found', 'God', 'Could', 'be', 'be', 'Doomsday', 'Killer', 'really', 'repented', 'switched', 'life', 'doing', 'good', 'lot', 'questions', 'are', 'raised', 'season', 'episodes.Even', 'Debra', 'question', 'exact', 'feelings', 'adopted', 'brother', 'Dexter.In', 'pure', 'Dexter', 'classic', 'form', 'season', 'full', 'surprising', 'plot', 'twists', 'Dexter', 'survive', 'fatal', 'escapades', 'still', 'stay', 'ahead', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'coworkers', 'Miami', 'must', 'be', 'one', 'dangerous', 'city', 'serial', 'killers', 'running', 'around', 'year', 'also', 'must', 'lot', 'open', 'cases', 'Miami', 'Dexter', 'disposes', 'killers', 'just', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'steps', 'away', 'killers', 'are', 'never', 'found', 'so', 'do', 'good', 'people', 'Miami', 'live', 'fear', 'Fortunately', 'DEXTER', 'writer', 'fantasy', 'show', 'just', 'addicted', 'story']",N/A

1458003,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B005FISBTO,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[0, 2]","This sixth season counts twelve episodes, which is fitting since it is based on the Christian Apocalypse, in fact not the one in John's Book of Revelation, but another reconstructed version widely enriched with the numerous apocalypses that exist or existed in the Levant and even the Middle East traditions,  going back to the Zoroastrians and the Babylonians, hence to the old apocalyptic visions we can find in old Sumerian documents (clay tablets)  and Zoroastrian stories that are as old as the Sanskrit Vedas, if not even older. But altogether we remain within the vast tradition of the three originally-if-not-still-Semitic religions.It is a fad today, and has been for quite a while, to integrate the Apocalypse in TV series. I can just quote the most famous ones like ""Supernatural"" in the USA (WB TV) and ""Being Human"" in Great Britain (BBC). And of course we have to think of the secular vision or rewriting of it in the long series of ""Terminator"" and the ""Sarah Connors chronicles."" But ""Supernatural"" is seen from the point of view of the monster hunters who try to prevent the coming of the apocalypse that is programmed in an inescapable way, and yet, there is always a way out when there is a way in. On the other hand ""Being Human"" is the apocalypse seen from the point of view of vampires and it is again the attempt to stop it by blocking the taking over of the earth by the Old Ones (the vampires from the original millennia of humanity). This sixth season of ""Dexter"" takes the apocalypse from the point of view of a deranged, fundamentalist Christian zealot who thinks that by enacting the prediction you could bring the end of the world. Dexter is thus the one who is trying to stop the criminal and that is not easy.If you consider the apocalypse and all the religious bull that goes along with it in the minds of all latter night (not to speak of days) prophets, read my lips to see who I mean, is undrinkable, just avoid this season. If on the other side you are only interested in serial killers and catching them, what's more if you believe in one serial killer being able to catch all the serial killers and pass them to the other side of the transatlantic Gulf Stream back to Europe where they probably or obviously belong, then welcome to this season.But there is a lot more than that.The series this season definitely defends the idea that you have to believe in some kind of higher force behind the universe. It ridicules the fundamentalist zealots of the three originally-if-not-still-Semite religions for sure. But it states very clearly these people are dangerous.In the same way it ridicules the fundamentalist zealots of the evolutionary theory that can only impose their stuff with harsh and purely rhetorical attacks on the creationist point of view, hence the zealot fundamentalist originally-if-not-still-Semite beliefs. Rhetoric is not an argument and certainly not evidence or proof of anything. It is nothing but play on words and superficial semantic jingling juggling. In fact there is no proof of any sort on either side.On one hand the question ""Who created the universe?"" and the answer ""God."" will bring the next question: ""Who created God?"" And there is no end in that direction except the crazy science fiction of Ron L. Hubbard and Scientology that we are nothing but the rejects of an extra-terrestrial civilization that existed zillion, zillion, zillion, zillion, zillion years ago. And then ""Who created these extra-terrestrials?""On the other hand if you are on the side of evolution and science, nothing comes from nothing. We can say the beginning of the universe we know is a famous ""big bang"" but then since nothing comes from nothing (Lavoisier among others in the 18th century) that ""big bang"" came from something, there was something before that ""big bang"". Then what was it and where did that come from? Evolution is a theory that perfectly explains life, in fact not only vegetal and animal life but also mineral and cosmic life, the way we know it and over a very long period of time, knowing that what we see at the outer limits of the visible universe (with modern technology) is what it was billions of years ago and we have no way to know what it is today, except through speculation and reconstruction.In the same way this season uses a lot of symbols in the most irritating way, especially the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. It is written somewhere: ""I am the alpha and the omega"" but it is in fact slightly more than that: ""I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."" (Bible, Revelation 1:8, Standard American Version). The first part states that there was no time before the beginning, and states that there will be no time after the end. That led Saint Augustine to considering that eternity, before the creation and after the end of this world is timelessness. But then how can the past ""was"", the present ""is"" and the future ""is to come"" not be seen as contradictory, except if you play on words and consider that verbal tenses refer to time and hence there is no past and no future before and after the creation and the end of it. ""Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; vanity of vanities, all is vanity."" (Bible, Ecclesiastes, 1:2, Standard American Version) Just as if the eclipse of the last episode was the end of the world. How nave!As entertainment this season is great, even maybe greater than the previous ones because there is a fairly tighter unity of the twelve episodes and a fairly ugly fight for power at the head of the Miami Metro Police Department. But as for the ideology and the ideas it transports and even bombards onto you it is slightly nave and definitely over-powerful. We are not supposed to think about all those theories and political or ideological ideas, but at the very same time it is unfair to crush the audience with such heavy-weight hammers and expect the audience to say thank you and not be in anyway influenced by it. Luckily the classification of the season is -18, ""suitable only for persons of 18 years and over"" and ""not to be supplied to anyone under that age,"" but even so how can we assume that over 18 year olf people can be un-influenced by such heavy at least graphic arguments.In fact it is not the apocalypse per se that is at stake here but the exclusive reference to the three originally-if-not-still-Semite religions. ""Supernatural"" is careful to refer to a lot of religions and other beliefs. ""Being Human"" is careful to refer to a lot of theories that have nothing to do with the three afore-mentioned religions. But this season of ""Dexter"" is extremely narrowly targeting that particular vision in the three afore-said religions. At least the Buddhist can have a great laugh at it.

1458005,A32B6XWNR55SRL,B005FISBTO,James W. Durney,"[0, 0]","This season Dexter's serial killer is obsessed with bringing on the end of the world.His methodology is to create events from the Book of Revelation thereby causing the end of the world.This season is pregnant with questions of faith, God and forgiveness.  The result is a dark forbidding story striped of almost all comedic overtones.The light-hearted ""oh my god, this shouldn't be funny but it is"" comedy series is gone.The replacement is a dramatic series with philosophic overtones allowing for more character interactions and developments.Debra is moving from a plot device to a real character with her own issues.Angel is less likable as a bully quashing his little sister's romance.Quinn is spiraling downward toward his total destruction.LaGuerta is slipping from a political backstabber into a full blown criminal willing to do anything for a promotion or an advantage.Brother Sam, who finds God in prison, goes from Dexter's potential target to showing Dexter to true faith and forgiveness.His influence may be Dexter's redemption and expel the ""dark passenger"".Brother Sam's real Christian faith is the counter to the Doomsday Killer's mistaken ideas that can make faith toxic.Dexter always has excellent casting and acting.  Season six continues that with no false notes.  Even the smallest parts are believable and look right.Overall, while seasons five and six go in a different direction from seasons one to four the series is worth watching with interesting characters and fresh stories.This is why the series is in its' seventh season.Showtime put a commercial on each of the DVDs in this set.

So now Dexter's sister Deb suddenly realizes that she loves her brother, oh no, not just loves him; but LOVES him... I just think I'm gonna barf! Come on writers! Deb is a hard -nosed, no nonsense detective, she would have a highly developed sense of morality and I can tell you as someone who was adopted with an adopted sister, you don't fall in love with your sister after it's revealed that she was really adopted, if you're a normal person. Hello, Deb is supposed to be the NORMAL sibling in this relationship...right? You expect weird and abnormal behavior from Dexter, he's a psychopath after all, but I mean COME ON! Besides that disgusting and illogical plot twist, I thought the writing and directing was weak in season 6. I felt none of the suspense or creepiness that typified the earlier seasons, which I LOVED. Colin Hanks is a good actor, but he lacks the gravitas to carry off the complex emotions that were needed to bring off the DDK killer, I just didn't buy it.

This is a return to that while still that the character has evolved emotionally. Okay to explain my love of season six I have to explain what I feel were the failures of seasons 3,4 and somewhat 5. I liked season 2 a lot.  It was a bit taudry, soap opera like but the stuff with Doakes was priceless and kept my attention all the way through and Lila did make a pretty good foil, and it was fun to have Dexter leaning the pleasures of sex. By season three everyone seems to agree was the weakest, a fairly weak villain in Jimmy Schmidt and that skinner killer that was just boring as all get out with what had to be the worst final episode execution by Dexter, it's like the writers over did it with filler and forgot they had a season to wrap up. Then season four which I must admit left me cold, I never gave a crap about Dexter as a family man so the Lithgow plot didn't do it for me and Rita just seemed to prove to be more of an obstical for the Dexter I fell for in season one rather than his guiding light. Then you have season five which had its high points but was dragged down by the Dexter step daughter plotline, the LaGuerta/Batista plotline that went nowhere and served only to pad the story out to 13 episodes.Now you have season six, Dexter's a free man, no one to get in his way, no one (Rita) to explain himself to. We see he's an emotinal indivisual without the scenes being over the top, he loves his son, it's more than obvious and it's the most rewarding (for me) relationship Dexter's had. The religious overtones work perfectly for me, althoug I'm not religious I find faith an interesting subject, I found Brother Sam one of the best characters to be introduced in the Dexter series. This is the first time since the Ice Truck killer that I actually found the big baddie of any interest. Finally, the cops aren't continously on Dexter's arse, that got old around season three. Plus the inner monologue's as sharp as it's been since season one, whereas for atleast the last three seasons Dex's inner thoughts were a bland as a boiled potato. Everything's been sharpened up, the characters (old and new), the cases, the subplots and overall moodiness of the series. Oh my god even Deb's plot is good, she's not the annoying little sister that needs her boyfriends approval in this season, she has her insecurities but they're understandable.

1458033,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B005FISBTO,Kasey G,"[1, 4]","After a disappointing fifth season, ""Dexter"" rebounds here with a riveting series of episodes that will keep you wanting more. Season 5 of ""Dexter"" suffered from the mistake of not introducing the main plotline until nearly halfway in (and it really wasn't that compelling a story once it did kick in making for the weakest season yet). I was worried the show would continue on its downward spiral, but thankfully the writers redeem themselves this go-'round. While it doesn't pack the wallop of Seasons 4 or 1, this collection is far superior to Season 3 (with Jimmy Smits) or the lacklustre Season 5 (with Julia Stiles).Dexter must embrace religion this season by helping track down the Doomsday Killers and befriending ex-convict-turned-preacher Brother Sam. The religious theme allows for some terrific gruesome set pieces as the Doomsday Kills are re-enactments of the Book of Revelations (a group of horses and a greenhouse scene are so particularly creepy they will stay with the viewer for days). The storyline also allows the writers to use one of the show's more familiar gimmicks against the audience, yet we never feel cheated.The writers wisely shake things up at Miami Metro, where staleness was setting in. Laguerta and Deb are both promoted, and Quinn and Battista are now partners, which opens up a whole new bunch of plot possibilites. Work and personal pressures take their toll on Deb and she begins seeing a therapist. Quinn jeopardizes his career with a run of destructive behaviour after Deb rejects his marriage proposal. Masuka is still the pervy comic relief, but even he gets to tread new waters as the writers pair him up with a series of new interns. A new officer named Anderson transfers in from Chicago but the character doesn't make much of a splash. Despite these changes, Battista and Laguerta get less screen time this season, as the writers begin to explore the complex relationship between Dexter and Debra. By season's end, each of them make discoveries that will forever alter their respective futures.Notable guest stars include Ronny Cox (""Deliverance""), Molly Parker (""Swingtown"") and even Rudy/Brian a.k.a The Ice Truck Killer makes a surprise return. If you were disappointed with Season 5 as I was, don't let that deter you from getting this--it's miles better.FOUR-and-a-HALF STARS and great to see the show back on track and still delivering macabre thrills.",4,"""Dexter"" Rebounds From a Lacklustre Season 5",1345507200,"08 21, 2012",2012,2406,"['disappointing', 'fifth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'here', 'riveting', 'series', 'episodes', 'will', 'keep', 'wanting', 'more', 'Season', '5', 'Dexter', 'suffered', 'mistake', 'not', 'introducing', 'main', 'plotline', 'nearly', 'halfway', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'story', 'did', 'kick', 'making', 'weakest', 'season', 'yet', 'was', 'worried', 'show', 'would', 'continue', 'downward', 'spiral', 'thankfully', 'writers', 'redeem', ""go-'round"", ""n't"", 'pack', 'wallop', 'Seasons', '4', '1', 'collection', 'far', 'superior', 'Season', '3', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'lacklustre', 'Season', '5', 'Julia', 'Stiles', '.Dexter', 'must', 'embrace', 'religion', 'season', 'helping', 'track', 'down', 'Doomsday', 'Killers', 'befriending', 'ex-convict-turned-preacher', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'religious', 'theme', 'terrific', 'gruesome', 'set', 'pieces', 'Doomsday', 'Kills', 'are', 're-enactments', 'Book', 'Revelations', 'group', 'horses', 'greenhouse', 'scene', 'are', 'so', 'particularly', 'creepy', 'will', 'stay', 'viewer', 'days', 'storyline', 'also', 'writers', 'use', 'one', 'show', 'more', 'familiar', 'gimmicks', 'audience', 'yet', 'never', 'feel', 'cheated.The', 'writers', 'wisely', 'shake', 'things', 'up', 'Miami', 'Metro', 'where', 'staleness', 'was', 'setting', 'Laguerta', 'Deb', 'are', 'promoted', 'Quinn', 'Battista', 'are', 'now', 'partners', 'up', 'whole', 'new', 'bunch', 'plot', 'possibilites', 'Work', 'personal', 'pressures', 'take', 'toll', 'Deb', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'Quinn', 'career', 'run', 'destructive', 'behaviour', 'Deb', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'Masuka', 'still', 'pervy', 'comic', 'relief', 'even', 'tread', 'new', 'waters', 'writers', 'pair', 'up', 'series', 'new', 'interns', 'new', 'officer', 'named', 'Anderson', 'transfers', 'Chicago', 'character', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'splash', 'changes', 'Battista', 'Laguerta', 'get', 'less', 'screen', 'time', 'season', 'writers', 'begin', 'explore', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Dexter', 'Debra', 'season', 'end', 'make', 'discoveries', 'will', 'forever', 'alter', 'respective', 'futures.Notable', 'guest', 'stars', 'include', 'Ronny', 'Cox', 'Deliverance', 'Molly', 'Parker', 'Swingtown', 'even', 'Rudy/Brian', 'Ice', 'Truck', 'Killer', 'surprise', 'return', 'were', 'disappointed', 'Season', '5', 'was', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'getting', 'miles', 'better.FOUR-and-a-HALF', 'STARS', 'great', 'see', 'show', 'back', 'track', 'still', 'delivering', 'macabre', 'thrills']",N/A

I normally have to wait until the DVD comes out. After reading some of the negativity here, I was prepared to not like this season as much. Not the case, it was gripping and I finished all of the episodes in three nights, and now I'm ready for Season 7. Now to convince my husband to keep the premium channels for fall.While Travis Marshall wasn't nearly as compelling as Trinity, the show has done well at creating the super-villain. The only one I was never really happy with was Miguel Prada (Jimmy Smits) in Season 3, and I feel that they drastically underused Jonny Lee Miller as Jordan Chase. I wish he had been a bigger part of Season 5. We got to see Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos from the start and Colin throughout the entire series.Religion is a HUGE part of the season and runs straight through. And it actually makes sense for Dexter to be struggling with religion and redemption at this point in his life as he tries to be a better person for his son. For those squeamish about religion being tied in, they're going to be offended right off the bat because there are some disturbing scenes. Also, this season definitely had more gore than I've remembered from before .***Spoiler***As far as Debra's development, I think Jennifer Carpenter did amazing work this season, but then I've always liked her take on Deb. Yes, her revelation about Dexter created some squeamish moments simply because he is absolutely clueless to what is going on in her head, but moments between these two have always been my favorite part of the show. They've never been the best at communication, something that is discussed this season. But, they have gone through a lot together and have always been there for each other. And no, there is no biological tie, so if that's where the show is headed, well, I go down that road because I want to see what happens with these characters. I think the last moments of the finale may diminish some of those feelings ha! It has to be difficult for the actors considering their own history together, and to the reviewer that brought up their marriage and divorce, well that's just tacky.*Highlights: Dexter's joy ride to Nebraska and seeing an old, familiar face alongside him, and Mos Def as Brother Sam.",5,Nothing negative from me...,1339545600,"06 13, 2012",2012,2384,"['got', 'premiere', 'movie', 'package', 'True', 'Blood', 'was', 'hunting', 'Showtime', 'Monday', 'found', 'Season', '6', 'episodes', 'Dexter', 'normally', 'have', 'wait', 'DVD', 'out', 'reading', 'negativity', 'here', 'was', 'prepared', 'not', 'like', 'season', 'much', 'Not', 'case', 'was', 'gripping', 'finished', 'episodes', 'three', 'nights', 'now', ""'m"", 'ready', 'Season', '7', 'Now', 'convince', 'husband', 'keep', 'premium', 'channels', 'fall.While', 'Travis', 'Marshall', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'compelling', 'Trinity', 'show', 'done', 'well', 'creating', 'super-villain', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'happy', 'was', 'Miguel', 'Prada', 'Jimmy', 'Smits', 'Season', '3', 'feel', 'drastically', 'underused', 'Jonny', 'Lee', 'Miller', 'Jordan', 'Chase', 'wish', 'had', 'been', 'bigger', 'part', 'Season', '5', 'got', 'see', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'start', 'Colin', 'entire', 'series.Religion', 'HUGE', 'part', 'season', 'runs', 'straight', 'actually', 'sense', 'Dexter', 'be', 'struggling', 'religion', 'redemption', 'point', 'life', 'be', 'better', 'person', 'son', 'squeamish', 'religion', 'being', 'tied', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'offended', 'right', 'bat', 'are', 'disturbing', 'scenes', 'Also', 'season', 'definitely', 'had', 'more', 'gore', ""'ve"", 'remembered', 'before', '***Spoiler***As', 'far', 'Debra', 'development', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'did', 'amazing', 'work', 'season', 'then', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'take', 'Deb', 'Yes', 'revelation', 'Dexter', 'created', 'squeamish', 'moments', 'simply', 'absolutely', 'clueless', 'what', 'going', 'head', 'moments', 'two', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'part', 'show', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'best', 'communication', 'something', 'discussed', 'season', 'have', 'gone', 'lot', 'together', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'there', 'other', 'biological', 'tie', 'so', 'where', 'show', 'headed', 'well', 'go', 'down', 'road', 'want', 'see', 'what', 'characters', 'think', 'last', 'moments', 'finale', 'may', 'diminish', 'feelings', 'ha', 'be', 'difficult', 'actors', 'considering', 'own', 'history', 'together', 'reviewer', 'brought', 'up', 'marriage', 'divorce', 'well', 'just', 'tacky', '*Highlights', 'Dexter', 'joy', 'ride', 'Nebraska', 'seeing', 'old', 'familiar', 'face', 'Mos', 'Def', 'Brother', 'Sam']",N/A

1458058,A33775AIB1A664,B005FISBTO,"Mark Colan ""duke-of-url""","[0, 0]","Season six of Dexter is getting rather tired.  We are dog tired of the gross, symbolic opening sequence that was amusing the first season or two, but it's been the same, no changes.The basic formula of the show - where some bad guy in each episode is sleuthed out by Dexter, who eventually tracks him down and kills him in some ironic and justifiable fashion - is all but gone in this season, save the high school reunion scene at the beginning.That leaves the story arc that spans each season, and is different for each one, and the story arc that spans the series.Again, NO SPOILERS.THIS SEASON'S STORY ARCThis season they brought in Edward James Olmos, who was magnificent in the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but they didn't give him a lot of rope in this plot.  They brought in Tom Hanks' son Colin, who was pretty good as the leading bad guy, but didn't quite save the season.  And a plot about the Apocalypse (the end of days according to the Christian Bible), which done right can be intriguing and creepy, and at times it approached these.  But the plot didn't really hold up, and it kind of fizzled out at the end.THE SERIES STORY ARCThe story arc spanning the series is the two halves of Dexter's life - home and work - which are not all that separable due to his sister working where he does, and this season, due to a hot new babysitter who is the sister of Batista.  Really?  She can make a living as a sitter?  But she IS hot.  The only possible explanation for Dexter resisting her is that it's not in the script.Office politics plays a major role in the story for a change, particularly where they involve Debra (Dexter's sister), who is going through a lot of changes in the office, as well as taking up therapy.  She is learning a lot about herself and her relationship with her ""brother"", to whom she is not actually a blood relation.And in the end, just as the Apocalypse finale sputters and fizzles out, we suddenly realize that it's this other story line that was the real point of this season after all.  Oh there were clues all along, but we did not see it coming.  We have seen cliffhangers in earlier seasons of Dexter resulting in potential changes in the series story arc, and this event may as well.The question is, will this event be enough to reinvigorate the series?  Because to my way of thinking, season 4 - with Trinity - was the last really compelling series, and seasons five and six have been simply paying the dues.BOTTOM LINEThree Stars on Amazon means ""It's OK"".

The writing is stale and predictable. My best advice to anyone considering this purchase is: Don't do it.If you feel you must watch it, find it at the library, or buy it by the episode. Had I bought it by the episode on streaming - I would have given up by episode four and not purchased anymore. On the strength of the last five seasons I purchased the entire season - BIG mistake.This season of Dexter is from an alternative dimension of time and space where quality writing and original plots have gone extinct.***SPOILER ALERT***Characters are doing uncharacteristic things with little, no, or entirely inadequate motivation. Laguarta, was once a multidimensional character, who was smart, sexy, and ambitious - now she's morphed into a one-dimensional B*** who exists solely to give Deb a hard time.. Didn't we already see that in season one?Deb does her best impression of Doogie Howser in the shows' most absurd move of making her the lieutenant. Her promotion to detective stretched the credibility of the show given her tender age, lieutenant is ridiculousAnd speaking of age, Welcome to Miami Florida, where there are no women over 30... Well, at least not on Dexter. The post-pubescent women on the show have all been shipped off, no explanation for the Nannie, who has been replaced with Batista's 18 year old anorexic sister who appeared out of nowhere, contributes nothing to the show and takes up far too much screen time with her flying saucer eyes.When Nick confesses on the beach to Brother Sam's murder, he laughs maniacally and taunts Dexter - The entire scene as with each episode is steeped in melodrama and felt more like an episode of Law and Order SVU...The show used to have a tongue in cheek humor in regards to sex. What was once humorous has degraded into old fashioned sexism and over-used clich&eacute;s. Seriously, since when did anyone laugh at Masuka's jokes? He was a creep and his creepy humor was used to show how others perceived him and differentiated their integrity from his vulgar wit - a subtlety that flew over the heads of the new writers.The actors all seem to be on autopilot as if they are sleep walking through their lines - They can't even act excited to be stuck with all these bad lines.The show got itself stuck in a desperate cycle of having a guest start serial killer, unable to break free and try something new, the show circles through this now all too familiar ground. So the show goes for some shock value and guts all of its integrity by bringing back Brian.Not content to try and quicken this dying show with its former glory of the ice-truck killer coming back as Dexter's imaginary friend, they must instantly double dip this quickening with the left overs from the Trinity story line.So... on a road trip, Dexter grabs a quicky with a 7-11 cashier (what?! Dexter, whose been with two women in his whole life?!) Debra goes all emo and falls in love with Dexter?! Did this season's writers even watch the previous five seasons? None of the characters would act this strange if they all dropped acid and went to a rave.Someone tell me this entire season was a bad dream that Dexter will wake up from like Dallas's dream season or better yet, he'll wake up like Bob Newhart did, next to his wife.",1,"Not with a bang, but a whimper...",1345248000,"08 18, 2012",2012,3428,"['seasons', 'whimper', 'sputters', 'along', 'convulsing', 'till', 'previous', 'highlights', 'glories.Everything', 'off', 'kilter', 'season', 'writing', 'stale', 'predictable', 'best', 'advice', 'anyone', 'considering', 'purchase', 'Do', ""n't"", 'do', 'it.If', 'feel', 'must', 'watch', 'find', 'library', 'buy', 'episode', 'Had', 'bought', 'episode', 'streaming', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'episode', 'four', 'not', 'purchased', 'anymore', 'strength', 'last', 'five', 'seasons', 'purchased', 'entire', 'season', 'BIG', 'mistake.This', 'season', 'Dexter', 'alternative', 'dimension', 'time', 'space', 'where', 'quality', 'writing', 'original', 'plots', 'have', 'gone', 'extinct', '***SPOILER', 'ALERT***Characters', 'are', 'doing', 'uncharacteristic', 'things', 'little', 'entirely', 'inadequate', 'motivation', 'Laguarta', 'was', 'once', 'multidimensional', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'smart', 'sexy', 'ambitious', 'now', 'morphed', 'one-dimensional', 'B***', 'who', 'solely', 'give', 'Deb', 'hard', 'time..', 'Did', ""n't"", 'already', 'see', 'season', 'one', 'Deb', 'best', 'impression', 'Doogie', 'Howser', 'shows', 'most', 'absurd', 'move', 'making', 'lieutenant', 'promotion', 'detective', 'stretched', 'credibility', 'show', 'given', 'tender', 'age', 'lieutenant', 'ridiculousAnd', 'speaking', 'age', 'Welcome', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'where', 'are', 'women', '30', 'Well', 'least', 'not', 'Dexter', 'post-pubescent', 'women', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'shipped', 'off', 'explanation', 'Nannie', 'who', 'been', 'replaced', 'Batista', '18', 'year', 'old', 'anorexic', 'sister', 'who', 'appeared', 'nowhere', 'nothing', 'show', 'up', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'flying', 'saucer', 'eyes.When', 'Nick', 'confesses', 'beach', 'Brother', 'Sam', 'murder', 'maniacally', 'taunts', 'Dexter', 'entire', 'scene', 'episode', 'steeped', 'melodrama', 'felt', 'more', 'episode', 'Law', 'Order', 'SVU', 'show', 'used', 'have', 'tongue', 'cheek', 'humor', 'regards', 'sex', 'What', 'was', 'once', 'humorous', 'degraded', 'old', 'fashioned', 'sexism', 'over-used', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Seriously', 'when', 'did', 'anyone', 'laugh', 'Masuka', 'jokes', 'was', 'creep', 'creepy', 'humor', 'was', 'used', 'show', 'how', 'others', 'perceived', 'differentiated', 'integrity', 'vulgar', 'wit', 'subtlety', 'flew', 'heads', 'new', 'writers.The', 'actors', 'seem', 'be', 'autopilot', 'are', 'sleep', 'walking', 'lines', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'act', 'excited', 'be', 'stuck', 'bad', 'lines.The', 'show', 'got', 'stuck', 'desperate', 'cycle', 'having', 'guest', 'start', 'serial', 'killer', 'unable', 'break', 'free', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'show', 'now', 'too', 'familiar', 'ground', 'show', 'shock', 'value', 'guts', 'integrity', 'bringing', 'back', 'Brian.Not', 'content', 'try', 'quicken', 'dying', 'show', 'former', 'glory', 'ice-truck', 'killer', 'coming', 'back', 'Dexter', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'must', 'instantly', 'double', 'dip', 'quickening', 'left', 'overs', 'Trinity', 'story', 'line.So', 'road', 'trip', 'Dexter', 'grabs', 'quicky', '7-11', 'cashier', 'what', 'Dexter', 'been', 'two', 'women', 'whole', 'life', 'Debra', 'emo', 'love', 'Dexter', 'Did', 'season', 'writers', 'even', 'watch', 'previous', 'five', 'seasons', 'None', 'characters', 'would', 'act', 'strange', 'dropped', 'acid', 'went', 'rave.Someone', 'tell', 'entire', 'season', 'was', 'bad', 'dream', 'Dexter', 'will', 'wake', 'up', 'Dallas', 'dream', 'season', 'better', 'yet', ""'ll"", 'wake', 'up', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'did', 'next', 'wife']",N/A

Likewise, the decision to make Deb's love for Dexter more than sisterly seems shock value rather than a plausible storyline.  As for Tom Hanks offspring---Colin's performance lacks true menace or depth.  Edward James Olmos is wasted in his role as Hanks' mentor.  Rapper Mos is surprisingly effective as the ""redeemed"" Brother Sam.  Michael C. Hall as usual is superb, bringing incredible nuance to his complex anti-hero role.  Jennifer Carpenter has a great season as Deb, given marvelous opportunities to display her wide range of abilities.  Her lack of Emmy nominations is baffling.  Fellow cast regulars---Desmond Harrington, Lauren Valez, James Remar, CS Lee, Geoff Pierson and David Zayas---provide excellent support.

The show started to slip a little bit in season five, but nothing too bad.  In this season, however, the writing in the show goes completely off the rails!!The biggest problem with the sixth season is that the new showrunners have absolutely no idea how to write their characters, so these characters end of acting completely OUT of character.  The worst of this is in the characterization of Dexter himself.  This builds up more and more as the season plods through one ridicuolous storyline after another, finally culminating in probably the dumbest ""cliffhanger"" ending EVER filmed.  I will not give away the ending in case anyone else wants to watch this wretched season for themselves, but suffice to say that the writers obviously had an intended final scene and were determined to have that scene, even if it meant throwing out every shred of common sense and believablity, as well as all characterization that had been built up in prior seasons.The acting performances are good, considering that the cast had so much nonsense to work with.

So if you buy it, please be aware of that.On to a short review.It's kind of hard to give a review for this season without giving away something, so this one will be short. I enjoyed it, but it felt like they changed directors or writers or something. Dexter's dad, whose been dead for some time, is at his side a great deal more this season. Also, what happens with Debra, his sister, seems out of character, but I can't say more without giving away something. The ending was really good though (BUT DO NOT SEE THE PREVIEWS PRIOR TO THE SHOW OR THE ENDING TO THE ENTIRE SEASON WILL BE GIVE AWAY), and you'll definitely go nuts waiting for season 7 to come out, like I am now.I know that's kind of a mediocre review, but I hope that it helps someone.

moment and leaves you desperately wanting to get straight into season 7As far as the other charactor development goes everyone seems to move forward, Angel and Quin make an interesting and highly entertaining partnership especially with both dealing with major personal set backs and their behavior is certainly not professional, especially Quin who goes completely off the rails.Debra struggles with her new found responsibility especially having to deal with more politics while having to take a backseat to investigating where she is at home.Not only is this the best dexter season yet but it sets up the coming final 2 seasons of Dexter perfectly and i for one am looking forward to the wild ride",5,A return to form for Dexter,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2012,2437,"['**', 'worth', 'noting', 'based', 'other', 'reviews', 'bought', 'copy', 'Australia', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'beginning', 'disk', 'spoiler', 'showing', 'ending', 'season', '**Season', 'four', 'Trinity', 'death', 'Rita', 'final', 'scenes', 'was', 'gripping', 'high', 'quality', 'TV', 'set', 'up', 'what', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'season', 'five', 'five', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'big', 'dissapointment.But', 'season', 'six', 'right', 'back', 'track', 'opinion', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'first', 'little', 'daunting', 'considdering', 'time', 'gap', 'seasons', '5', '6', 'alot', 'changed', 'when', 'considder', 'show', '12', 'episode', 'season', 'are', '52', 'weeks', 'year', 'season', '4', '5', 'were', 'continueous', 'sense', 'advance', 'forward', 'do', 'really', 'expect', 'be', 'waiting', '40', 'weeks', 'seasons', 'have', 'everything', 'exactly', 'same', 'Between', 'seasons', 'dexter', 'found', 'balance', 'being', 'father', 'also', 'feeding', 'dark', 'passanger', 'so', 'fine', 'formThe', 'main', 'storyline', 'season', 'Doomsday', 'killers', 'murders', 'based', 'book', 'revolation', 'overall', 'whole', 'season', 'strong', 'religious', 'undertones', 'not', 'way', 'forcing', 'down', 'throats', 'being', 'disrespectful', 'who', 'are', 'religious', 'way', 'Dexter', 'own', 'thoughts', 'feelings', 'questions', 'merit', 'religion', 'intriguing', 'entertaining.The', 'doomsday', 'killings', 'are', 'gory', 'yet', 'artistic', 'very', 'twisted', 'real', 'highlight', 'season', 'be', 'living', 'city', 'where', 'types', 'killings', 'were', 'happening', 'would', 'truely', 'be', 'are', 'great', 'twist', 'season', 'like', 'tv', 'be', 'predictable', 'maybe', 'season', 'not', 'season', 'ending', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'truelly', 'holly', 's', '@', 't', 'moment', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'get', 'straight', 'season', '7As', 'far', 'other', 'charactor', 'development', 'everyone', 'move', 'forward', 'Angel', 'Quin', 'make', 'interesting', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'partnership', 'especially', 'dealing', 'major', 'personal', 'set', 'backs', 'behavior', 'certainly', 'not', 'professional', 'especially', 'Quin', 'who', 'completely', 'rails.Debra', 'new', 'found', 'responsibility', 'especially', 'having', 'deal', 'more', 'politics', 'having', 'take', 'backseat', 'investigating', 'where', 'home.Not', 'only', 'best', 'dexter', 'season', 'yet', 'up', 'coming', 'final', '2', 'seasons', 'Dexter', 'perfectly', 'i', 'one', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'wild', 'ride']",N/A

In this season every disk has a giant Showtime add you have to sit through on every disk which is really annoying.  I thought the benefit of buying the show on DVD over renting is that you would be spared of that but with this season it is not the case.  Also in the preview they show the ending of this season which I also really hate.  Yes, on disk one they show you Dexter stabbing the main Jesus freak in a church and his sister catching him.  This made watching the whole season a lot more dull than it already was.  The word god and Jesus are said so many times you can make a drinking game out of it.  I felt like the season was not well written.  Maybe I would have not cared as much if Seasons 4 and 5 were not so amazing but they were and this one kinda bit.  (Spoiler) The big bad is a skinny white boy (Tom Hanks's son) who seems too wooden to me a crazed killer to me.  I really felt he was miscast.  Maybe that was the point, to have someone who did not seem like a killer to be one but I still did not like the style of acting he brought to the role. His big plan is to make art out of dead people that will bring about the rapture.  It does not make a lot of sense.  I love the idea of a killer that makes art from dead people but strapping a bunch of body parts to horses to look the the horsemen of the apocalypse is not the same as them actually showing up.

The sixth season of ""Dexter"", as with the previous ones, may have a formula but that formula allows the writers/directors/producers and actors to continue to develop the characters in new and interesting directions for the show.There are marked changes for Dexter Morgan, his sister and his co-workers face some changes (a particularly big change that signals a change in direction for the series in season seven)with the latest season. Featuring Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos, the acting from regulars to the guest stars continue to be terrific.SPOILERS:With the sixth season Dexter faces the Doomsday Killers (Olmos and Hanks)two men who are trying to bring about the end of the world by recreating key moments from the book of Relevations. Along the way, Deb Morgan finds herself unexpectantly promoted and dropped right in the middle of a scandal involving a high ranking officer.END OF SPOILERS:The sixth season starts off really good (although, if you're sharp you'll be able to spot the twist in this season by the third episode)but by the last third the show comes across as a pale imitation of previous seasons with twists and turns that indicate, perhaps, that the writers were running out of ideas. What keeps the rest of the season fun to watch are the performances from the regulars as well as the guest stars all of whom are top notch. The premise for this season is exceptional it's just that the execution is a bit shakey. Still, for fans of ""Dexter"", the show will still be essential viewing.The Blu-ray transfer looks great with a sharp, detailed and colorful look to the show. The blacks are rock solid throughout so if you're looking to buy the Blu-ray the advantage is the nicely done transfer for the series.The lossless audio likewise sounds terrific.Where Showtime continues to fail is in the area of special features. Some people could care less about special features but they do matter to me. There are no commentary tracks and all the special features are only available via BD-Live. The interviews are pretty decent featuring Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, C. S. Lee, Colin Hanks and Desmond Harrington. WHY they don't have any featurettes on the productin of this season, shooting of various episodes, etc. is beyond me. It's cheap and doesn't reflect well on Showtime.The inclusion of episodes for other shows I probably wouldn't watch isn't all that big a loss (and I really don't consider the special features) but, given that's all that's really included, it would be NICE if it was actually on the Blu-ray disc. I don't uses BD-Live all that much anymore and, to be quite honest, to go on to view the episodes is a pain. Of course, the interviews and episodes (two each) of ""Californication"", ""The Borgias"" and ""House of Lies"" ARE included on the DVD. So, if you want special features and want to pay a little less (and can settle for DVD vs. Blu-ray high def quality), you may want to get the less expensive DVD.Recommmended even if once again Showtime drops the ball in terms of special features (again) and the season, as a whole, isn't quite as strong as what came before.",4,"good season, lousy extras on the Blu-ray (they aren't actually ON the Blu-ray)",1357344000,"01 5, 2013",2013,3233,"['One', 'days', 'Showtime', 'will', 'get', 'right', 'when', 'new', 'Blu-ray', 'releases', 'Dexter', 'sixth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'previous', 'ones', 'may', 'have', 'formula', 'formula', 'writers/directors/producers', 'actors', 'continue', 'develop', 'characters', 'new', 'interesting', 'directions', 'show.There', 'are', 'marked', 'changes', 'Dexter', 'Morgan', 'sister', 'co-workers', 'face', 'changes', 'particularly', 'big', 'change', 'change', 'direction', 'series', 'season', 'seven', 'latest', 'season', 'Featuring', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'acting', 'regulars', 'guest', 'stars', 'continue', 'be', 'terrific.SPOILERS', 'sixth', 'season', 'Dexter', 'Doomsday', 'Killers', 'Olmos', 'Hanks', 'two', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'bring', 'end', 'world', 'recreating', 'key', 'moments', 'book', 'Relevations', 'way', 'Deb', 'Morgan', 'unexpectantly', 'promoted', 'dropped', 'right', 'middle', 'scandal', 'involving', 'high', 'ranking', 'officer.END', 'SPOILERS', 'sixth', 'season', 'really', 'good', ""'re"", 'sharp', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'spot', 'twist', 'season', 'third', 'episode', 'last', 'third', 'show', 'across', 'pale', 'imitation', 'previous', 'seasons', 'twists', 'indicate', 'perhaps', 'writers', 'were', 'running', 'out', 'ideas', 'What', 'rest', 'season', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'performances', 'regulars', 'as', 'well', 'guest', 'whom', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'premise', 'season', 'exceptional', 'just', 'execution', 'bit', 'shakey', 'Still', 'fans', 'Dexter', 'show', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'essential', 'viewing.The', 'Blu-ray', 'transfer', 'great', 'sharp', 'detailed', 'colorful', 'look', 'show', 'blacks', 'are', 'rock', 'solid', 'so', ""'re"", 'looking', 'buy', 'Blu-ray', 'advantage', 'nicely', 'done', 'transfer', 'series.The', 'lossless', 'audio', 'likewise', 'terrific.Where', 'Showtime', 'fail', 'area', 'special', 'features', 'people', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'special', 'features', 'do', 'matter', 'are', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'only', 'available', 'BD-Live', 'interviews', 'are', 'pretty', 'decent', 'featuring', 'Michael', 'C.', 'Hall', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'Lauren', 'Velez', 'C.', 'S.', 'Lee', 'Colin', 'Hanks', 'Desmond', 'Harrington', 'WHY', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'featurettes', 'productin', 'season', 'shooting', 'various', 'episodes', 'etc', 'cheap', ""n't"", 'reflect', 'well', 'Showtime.The', 'inclusion', 'episodes', 'other', 'shows', 'probably', 'would', ""n't"", 'watch', ""n't"", 'big', 'loss', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'special', 'features', 'given', 'really', 'included', 'would', 'be', 'NICE', 'was', 'actually', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'uses', 'BD-Live', 'that', 'much', 'anymore', 'be', 'quite', 'honest', 'go', 'view', 'episodes', 'pain', 'course', 'interviews', 'episodes', 'two', 'Californication', 'Borgias', 'House', 'Lies', 'ARE', 'included', 'DVD', 'So', 'want', 'special', 'features', 'want', 'pay', 'little', 'less', 'can', 'settle', 'DVD', 'Blu-ray', 'high', 'def', 'quality', 'may', 'want', 'get', 'less', 'expensive', 'DVD.Recommmended', 'even', 'once', 'again', 'Showtime', 'ball', 'terms', 'special', 'features', 'again', 'season', 'whole', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'strong', 'what', 'came', 'before']",N/A

1458141,A1K7X23UDT0R7V,B005FISBTO,Winston D. Jen,"[0, 0]","While the first five seasons were nail-biting and thought-provoking at every turn, season six is an unqualified letdown in many ways.The twist that occurs shortly after the half-way point is so obvious and predictable that even a viewer unacquainted with crime dramas could see it coming miles away. The chief antagonist is hardly interesting (Dexter without rules, with several lengthy psycho-babble terms applied to his dossier), and the gore and viscera that are displayed make it look like the creators wanted to distract viewers from the poor writing and utter lack of introspection. This tactic was ultimately doomed to failure, as Dexter wastes an entire episode extending a storyline that played itself out in the early days of season five. We would have been better entertained (and the world of the show would have been better served) if the bulk of the episode was focused on Debra and her new responsibilities and revelations that she was forced to come to terms with during season five's climax.The side characters have become more of a sideshow. Quinn becomes a bumbling alcoholic, Angel Batista returns to clobbering anyone who looks at him the wrong way, and LaGuerta and Matthews are largely absent for the most part. With the dullest villain imaginable, this leaves little for fans of any character (although Masuka always delivers on the black/sick/filthy comedy front). The early scenes with Dexter's school reunion and his disposal of a serial killer who has entered Geriatric Land are entertaining, and leads to perhaps the most profound epiphany that Dexter learns regarding Harrison, his late-night hobby and himself.Overall, however, this season went off the rails, and was a disappointing cul-de-sac after five seasons of psychological introspection.",3,This Roller-Coaster Finally Runs off the Rails,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,1777,"['first', 'five', 'seasons', 'were', 'nail-biting', 'thought-provoking', 'turn', 'season', 'six', 'unqualified', 'letdown', 'many', 'ways.The', 'twist', 'shortly', 'half-way', 'point', 'so', 'obvious', 'predictable', 'even', 'viewer', 'unacquainted', 'crime', 'dramas', 'could', 'see', 'coming', 'miles', 'away', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'hardly', 'interesting', 'Dexter', 'rules', 'several', 'lengthy', 'psycho-babble', 'terms', 'applied', 'dossier', '\x10gore', 'viscera', 'are', 'displayed', 'make', 'look', 'creators', 'wanted', 'distract', 'viewers', 'poor', 'writing', 'utter', 'lack', 'introspection', 'tactic', 'was', 'ultimately', 'doomed', 'failure', 'Dexter', 'entire', 'episode', 'extending', 'storyline', 'played', 'out', 'early', 'days', 'season', 'five', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'entertained', 'world', 'show', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'bulk', 'episode', 'was', 'focused', 'Debra', 'new', 'responsibilities', 'revelations', 'was', 'forced', 'come', 'terms', 'season', 'five', 'climax.The', 'side', 'characters', 'have', 'become', 'more', 'sideshow', 'Quinn', 'bumbling', 'alcoholic', 'Angel', 'Batista', 'clobbering', 'anyone', 'who', 'wrong', 'way', 'LaGuerta', 'Matthews', 'are', 'largely', 'absent', 'most', 'part', 'dullest', 'villain', 'imaginable', 'little', 'fans', 'character', 'Masuka', 'always', 'black/sick/filthy', 'comedy', 'front', 'early', 'scenes', 'Dexter', 'school', 'reunion', 'disposal', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'entered', 'Geriatric', 'Land', 'are', 'entertaining', 'perhaps', 'most', 'profound', 'epiphany', 'Dexter', 'regarding', 'Harrison', 'late-night', 'hobby', 'himself.Overall', 'however', 'season', 'went', 'rails', 'was', 'disappointing', 'cul-de-sac', 'five', 'seasons', 'psychological', 'introspection']",N/A

1458143,A1XMETZBIAWAI9,B005FISBTO,Wrath,"[0, 0]","I should start off by saying that this is a great season of Dexter in which we get to see a lot of development out of all of the characters. I particularly like the dynamic between good and evil, how Dexter deals with light and dark and how Dexter struggles to contend with things that seem to be higher than himself. It's an interesting season that definitely shouldn't be missed for any Dexter fans.SO now on to the DVD review itself. I have been a huge fan of Dexter since season one. It always feels great to get the latest season and add it to my shelf like Dexter adds slides to his box. However I have noticed a trend with the DVD box sets that is just too big to ignore.The quality. Don't get me wrong, I am not a guy that has to have HD picture or even Blu Ray for everything, I am perfectly content with a good old fashioned regular DVD but this season's picture quality is quite frankly atrocious. It's pixelated and dark to the point that I can't even tell what some smaller objects even are. I don't know who did a quality check on this but they need to seriously find a new job. The plastic is cheap and flimsier than it has ever been and that's saying quite a bit because they have always used the smaller cases for each season but this is the first time I have had one just break one use.  The special features are sub par but really they have never had interesting features on their DVDs. I wish I could say that this was the fault of the 3rd party vendor I bought it from on Amazon but unfortunately the season was SEALED when I got it so there was no way for the 3rd party vendor to tamper with it unless they are just seriously good at making it look factory sealed,which I doubt. I am seriously surprised that anyone from Showtime, CBS DVD or Paramount had the gumption to put their name on this poorly executed box set and quite frankly they should be ashamed for such a serious slip in quality.I am just hoping that in the future they will decide to put a bit more time and effort in to giving me a quality product instead of just shoving the DVD out there and trying to rip me off.",3,"Great season, poor product",1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,2105,"['should', 'start', 'off', 'saying', 'great', 'season', 'Dexter', 'get', 'see', 'lot', 'development', 'characters', 'particularly', 'dynamic', 'good', 'evil', 'how', 'Dexter', 'deals', 'light', 'dark', 'how', 'Dexter', 'contend', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'higher', 'interesting', 'season', 'definitely', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'missed', 'Dexter', 'fans.SO', 'now', 'DVD', 'review', 'have', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Dexter', 'season', 'one', 'always', 'great', 'get', 'latest', 'season', 'add', 'shelf', 'Dexter', 'slides', 'box', 'However', 'have', 'noticed', 'trend', 'DVD', 'box', 'sets', 'just', 'too', 'big', 'ignore.The', 'quality', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'not', 'guy', 'have', 'HD', 'picture', 'even', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'everything', 'am', 'perfectly', 'content', 'good', 'old', 'fashioned', 'regular', 'DVD', 'season', 'picture', 'quality', 'quite', 'frankly', 'atrocious', 'pixelated', 'dark', 'point', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'tell', 'what', 'smaller', 'objects', 'even', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'did', 'quality', 'check', 'need', 'seriously', 'find', 'new', 'job', 'plastic', 'cheap', 'flimsier', 'ever', 'been', 'saying', 'quite', 'bit', 'have', 'always', 'used', 'smaller', 'cases', 'season', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'just', 'break', 'one', 'use', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'sub', 'par', 'really', 'have', 'never', 'had', 'interesting', 'features', 'DVDs', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'was', 'fault', '3rd', 'party', 'vendor', 'bought', 'Amazon', 'unfortunately', 'season', 'was', 'SEALED', 'when', 'got', 'so', 'was', 'way', '3rd', 'party', 'vendor', 'tamper', 'are', 'just', 'seriously', 'good', 'making', 'look', 'factory', 'sealed', 'doubt', 'am', 'seriously', 'surprised', 'anyone', 'Showtime', 'CBS', 'DVD', 'Paramount', 'had', 'gumption', 'put', 'name', 'poorly', 'executed', 'box', 'set', 'quite', 'frankly', 'should', 'be', 'ashamed', 'such', 'serious', 'slip', 'quality.I', 'am', 'just', 'hoping', 'future', 'will', 'decide', 'put', 'bit', 'more', 'time', 'effort', 'giving', 'quality', 'product', 'instead', 'just', 'shoving', 'DVD', 'there', 'trying', 'rip', 'off']",N/A
