1206063,A117GLT27415F6,B001JAHS5U,D. Ackerman,"[5, 16]",The rating is not for the show but for the delay.  Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD?  What do we have to do?  We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows.  I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand.  It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet.  But some of us want to spend our money legally.  And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.,1,What to do to get Seaon 5 and 6,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,577,"['rating', 'not', 'show', 'delay', 'Why', 'taking', 'so', 'long', 'get', 'seasons', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'shows', 'time', 'DVD', 'What', 'do', 'have', 'do', 'want', 'go', 'legal', 'way', 'are', 'being', 'pushed', 'illegal', 'means', 'order', 'obtain', 'shows', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'get', 'numerous', 'vendors', 'Thailand', 'would', 'not', 'surprise', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'already', 'available', 'download', 'internet', 'want', 'spend', 'money', 'legally', 'thanks', 'Fox', 'may', 'never', 'be', 'able']",The Bob Newhart Show: Season 6

Silverberg ""starrmaker""","[5, 18]","As someone that bought the first season of The Bob Newhart Show, I must say I was disappointed in the poor quality. I mean that while other series have character pictures and are one sided DVDs this set was two sided.

It hadn't.A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audienceI quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordereda box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released.
