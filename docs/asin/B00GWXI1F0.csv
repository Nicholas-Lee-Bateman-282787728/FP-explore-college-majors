1682592,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B00GWXI1F0,FYI,"[56, 63]","Martin Shaw is superb as a deeply intelligent and ethical police detective who has become fed-up with corruption at London's Met. Complex, honest, and stalwart, Inspector George Gently (Martin Shaw) is a veteran of World War II who had happily married his lovely Italian bride. After witnessing her murder in ""Series One,"" the grieving Gently seeks refuge in the North East. Shaw is masterful, powerfully depicting a man with deep integrity and convictions, and a talent for boxing. Those of you who enjoyVeraare in for a treat. Filmed in England's starkly beautiful North Country, and historic city of Durham, this vivid series boasts high-production values, and authentically recreates the ambiguous, and at times disturbing, era of the late 1960s.Series Five ended on a disturbing note, a cliffhanger, where the fate of our main characters was unsure. Veteran cop George Gently mentors Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby), a young fellow whose morals run adrift amidst the swirling social turmoil of the 1960s. As Gently's ambitious sidekick, Ingleby inhabits his character perfectly. You may recall Ingleby's inimitable turn inHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, as the Knight Bus conductor, Stan Shunpike. Blessed with abundant talent and a memorable voice, Ingleby is incisive as the menacing Vic Tyler in the highly regarded 1970s police/time-travel hitLife On Mars: The Complete Collection (U.K.). A fine constant is PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard), who grumblingly serves many a cuppa ofPG Tips Black Teawith plates of biscuits.Series Six resumes in 1969, several months after Gently and Bacchus were brutally shot admit the majestic Durham Cathedral. This encounter nearly claimed their lives, and both suffer post-traumatic stress, along with physical scars. Poor Bacchus is still recuperating in a police convalescent homeEach mystery is feature-length at 89 minutes. Thankfully, there are English subtitles, for those of who do not want to miss one word. For a three-dimensional taste experience, you may want to indulge in some Northumberland style bangers & mash, with a classic Newcastle Nut Brown Ale (a favorite of Bacchus') to top it off. Enjoy!""Gently Between the Lines""Gently is shocked to receive Bacchus's resignation, but understands that his sergeant has simply lost confidence. Although Gently seems to accept the young man's notice, he insists that Bacchus help with another murder investigation. After rioters were arrested after Newcastle police tried to clear a poor neighborhood out, prior to demolition and redevelopment, one of the protesters is found dead in the cells the next morning. The case causes both Gently and Bacchus to examine their role as police officers, during a time when law enforcement changed from being seen as locally based, to being thuggish agents of the state. Written by Tim Prager; cast includes: Robert Pugh, Steve Evets, Ruth Gemmell, Matt Stokoe and Caroline O'Neill.""Blue for Bluebird""This mystery is written by Jess Williams, of the marvelous series ""Call The Midwife."" Gently and Bacchus investigate the eccentric staff and holidaymakers at a holiday camp, when a body washes ashore. Under all the revelry and playful permissiveness, Gently and Bacchus expose a web of greed and jealousy. PC Rachel Coles (Lisa Mcgrillis) assists the team, with her more modern approach to policing. Guest stars include: Lee Boardman, and Pixie Lott.""Gently Going Under""During the late 1960s, massive economic shifts pressure communities in the North. As Northumberland's coal mining industry suffers, stress grows in tightly knit mining communities. In Burnsend, a body is found in the mine, and Gently and Bacchus must unearth the truth beneath the community's tensions. As it turns out, schisms and ill-feelings there date back to World War II. Though WWII may seem distant now, in 1969, it had only been over 24 years. To make a contemporary comparison, many of us recall the 1980s up to 1990 quite vividly. Time is relative, and memory collapses intervening years quite effectively. Written by Mike Cullen (the great Scottish series ""Taggart""); guest stars include: Grant Crookes, Neil Eddy, and Poppy Lee Friar.""Gently From the Cold""As often is the case in murder investigations, cases connect in ways not anticipated. Gently must investigate the decade's dark side, with the abuse of drug like LSD. He finds himself actually considering a Cold War conspiracy. Although he prefers to play things close to the vest, Gently must reach out for the help of a person he has relied on in the past. Whist they work on the case, despite himself, Gently feels drawn to his ally. Written by Jess Williams; guest stars include: Helen Coverdale.While you wait for more George, there is another wonderful mystery series set in Northumbria, worth savoring. Based upon novels by Ann Cleeves (Crow Trap), the series features the great Brenda Blethyn as caustic DCI Vera Stanhope:Vera,Vera: Set 2,Vera, Set 3(to be released).

Mellow-voiced Martin Shaw, as George Gently is superb as a very wise and caring detective guiding and advising his rather ""rough around the edges"" partner Detective Sergeant John Bacchus (wonderfully acted by Lee Ingleby);  Baccus really needs a tremendous amount of guidance from Shaw both personally and professionally. (In Season Six (6) Bacchus seems to mature but is still very rough--there were times that I felt like smacking him!)Series six (6) is, of course, void of any of the technological help to our detectives such as computers with Gently and Bacchus having to rely on basic  ""foot-work"" in solving some splendidly written  and directed mysteries involving murder in a Turkish bath, murder in coal mine, very young prostitution, military torture, civil unrest, police brutality,  etc.  They solve the cases most brilliantly; I was on the ""edge of my seat"" through all four episodes that are each well over an hour in length.

1682599,AD50CYPEWH6NN,B00GWXI1F0,Jon Wynne,"[9, 9]","After the stunning cliffhanger at the end of Series 5, it is with great satisfaction to find that the four episodes of GEORGE GENTLY Series 6 maintain the same high standard of quality as the previous programs. Gently Between the Lines, the first of the new episodes, shows the aftermath of Gently and Bacchus&#8217; respective recoveries. Gently, a war veteran, is able to take things in stride and move on, whereas Bacchus clearly suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and wants to leave the Force. This provides some immediate conflict between them.The episode opens with a riot scene in which it is interesting to note there isn&#8217;t a false moment to be found. Often in such scenes involving a lot of actors, the background performers can frequently be seen to be either over doing it or looking self-conscious. Such is the meticulous attention to detail&#8211;a defining aspect of this series&#8211;that this is not the case. Every actor plays the sequence with the utmost conviction.The attention to period detail (the series is now up to the year 1969) is completely convincing, including such bits of dialogue when a female police officer is called &#8220;Pet&#8221;, an example of &#8217;60s sexism, though interestingly in the series VERA, another Acorn Media release, Vera refers to almost everyone as &#8220;Pet&#8221;. This is a double standard, to be sure, but there you go.After a young man dies in police custody, Gently and Bacchus must investigate to see if they can shed light on the situation, especially as it appears the young man may be linked to the severe injury of a police constable who was at the riot scene. Gently&#8217;s investigation is not appreciated by the local police, who feel the young man was responsible for the wounding of the constable and should not be given any special investigative consideration. Needless to say, there is more to the situation than meets the eye. The actual suspect is set up early on in the episode in a throwaway line of dialogue that is easy to miss. Such is the subtlety of the writing.Of course, Bacchus must confront his fears to watch Gently&#8217;s back in the climax of the episode. This gets things back on track for the series to continue with their strained father/son relationship at the core.The second episode, Blue for Bluebird, involves the murder of a young woman working at a family resort and involves the attempts of the resort owners to keep the investigation quiet (much like in JAWS). A charming &#8217;60s dance routine is the big set piece here. It&#8217;s another involving, cleverly-plotted addition to the growing GEORGE GENTLY canon.Gently with Honour is another excellent episode, this time centred around secret drug testing by the military. Bacchus is particularly caustic in many of his remarks, which provides some comic relief.Some outstanding guest stars, particularly from Jemma Redgrave, make this episode arguably the best of Set 6.Lastly, Gently Going Under involves a murder in a mining town and puts Gently&#8217;s life in great peril. With pressure from his superiors to transfer to a desk job, Gently remains determined to continue doing what he does best: solve crimes and catch the bad guys, whatever the cost.GEORGE GENTLY is a great series. The powerful presence of Martin Shaw as Gently is the rock upon which the series is built, but he is matched all the way by Lee Ingleby&#8217;s Bacchus and a production team that spares no attention to detail. After six series the show still has legs. It will be interesting to see if the show continues at the end of the &#8217;60s or if it will cross over into the 1970s. In one of the excellent bonus extras Martin Shaw says he doesn&#8217;t think the show will work set in the &#8217;70s.

We are fans of this series that is set in the 1960's.  Sometimes a series in a specific period becomes more about the time and the politics than it does the characters, not so with George Gently.  The issues of the time are evident in the stories and in the attitudes, but these serve to enhance rather than take over the plot lines.  Season Six is phenomenal, with George Gently (Martin Shaw) and his sergeant John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby) returning to duty after both being seriously hurt in the line of duty.  Remember this is the age before we recognized PTSD, and both men outwardly seem unscathed by their recent experiences.  Each deals with the aftermath of injury differently, and both seem a bit caught in the past in the changing world of policing and crime detection.

1682603,A3U3BEZMH3F01Q,B00GWXI1F0,maskirovka,"[0, 0]","Martin Shaw as Chief Inspector George Gently is similar in a lot of ways to the equally fictional DCI Christopher Foyle.  Both are superb detectives and deeply ethical men who are widowers.  The difference between &#34;George Gently&#34; and &#34;Foyle's War&#34; is of course the time setting.  Gently is set in the 1960s (although I imagine we're going to see the 1970s too since this set was set in 1969).  Picking this time period was a stroke of genius because it must have been very tough to be a copper in a time of tremendous social upheaval and all kinds of new crime.The main selling point of the show is Shaw and Lee Ingelby, as Gently's &#34;bagman&#34; Detective Sergeant John Bacchus.  Both do an outstanding job of bringing their characters to life.  My only criticism of the way their characters are drawn is sometimes Gently comes across as a bit too progressive to be an old time copper in 1960s Britain and sometimes Bacchus comes across as a little thick.As far as the episodes go, I liked &#34;Gently Between the Lines&#34; and &#34;Blue Bird&#34; the best.  Both of them were very believable (the first being an investigation of a death in police custody after a riot and the second being a murder taking place at a holiday camp).I didn't like &#34;Gently with Honor&#34; all that much...&#60;spoilers&#62;Frankly, the whole thing came across as wildly implausible.  How believable is it that someone would commit a murder in front of a rolling camera and then not make sure the film of him committing such a terrible crime was destroyed?  After all, this was the 1960s, people couldn't just make a quick copy of something like that on their computer and post it to the Internet.Also, I couldn't help but think that the whole plot of the British Army drugging squaddies with LSD and then torturing them to see if they could use such techniques on the Russians smacked more of a plot out of the &#34;X-Files&#34; than reality.  I also could have done without the whole angle of the soldiers in question being gay and being forced to reveal that by the &#34;evil British Army officer.&#34;  The whole thing smacked of political correctness.&#60;end spoilers?The final episode in the set &#34;Gently Going Under&#34; was a good one but not quite as good as the the first two.  The setting for the murder --deep in a coal mine-- was pretty creative, but the complex family relationships that were critical to the story were a bit confusing, and I could have used a scene where someone explained the whole thing to make sure we all understood what was going on.This being said, I will look forward to the next set of Gently stories.  One major development in the late 1960s and early 1970s that I hope they use in a future story is Northern Ireland.  In 1969, the whole place went up in flames and by 1972, Belfast was like a war zone.  It would cool to see Gently and Bacchus deal with some of the spillover that took place in the Home Islands.",4,"Two Outstanding Episodes, One Disappointment, and One Good One",1403913600,"06 28, 2014",2014,2962,"['Martin', 'Shaw', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'George', 'Gently', 'similar', 'lot', 'ways', 'equally', 'fictional', 'DCI', 'Christopher', 'Foyle', 'are', 'superb', 'detectives', 'deeply', 'ethical', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'widowers', 'difference', '34', 'George', 'Gently', '34', '34', 'Foyle', 'War', '34', 'course', 'time', 'setting', 'Gently', 'set', '1960s', 'imagine', ""'re"", 'going', 'see', '1970s', 'too', 'set', 'was', 'set', '1969', 'Picking', 'time', 'period', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'tough', 'be', 'copper', 'time', 'tremendous', 'social', 'upheaval', 'kinds', 'new', 'crime.The', 'main', 'selling', 'point', 'show', 'Shaw', 'Lee', 'Ingelby', 'Gently', '34', 'bagman', '34', 'Detective', 'Sergeant', 'John', 'Bacchus', 'Both', 'do', 'outstanding', 'job', 'bringing', 'characters', 'life', 'only', 'criticism', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'drawn', 'sometimes', 'Gently', 'across', 'bit', 'too', 'progressive', 'be', 'old', 'time', 'copper', '1960s', 'Britain', 'sometimes', 'Bacchus', 'across', 'little', 'thick.As', 'far', 'episodes', 'go', 'liked', '34', 'Gently', 'Between', 'Lines', '34', '34', 'Blue', 'Bird', '34', 'best', 'were', 'very', 'believable', 'first', 'being', 'investigation', 'death', 'police', 'custody', 'riot', 'second', 'being', 'murder', 'taking', 'place', 'holiday', 'camp', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', '34', 'Gently', 'Honor', '34', 'much', '60', 'spoilers', '62', 'Frankly', 'whole', 'thing', 'came', 'wildly', 'implausible', 'How', 'believable', 'someone', 'would', 'commit', 'murder', 'front', 'rolling', 'camera', 'then', 'not', 'make', 'sure', 'film', 'committing', 'terrible', 'crime', 'was', 'destroyed', 'was', '1960s', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'quick', 'copy', 'something', 'computer', 'post', 'Internet.Also', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'whole', 'plot', 'British', 'Army', 'drugging', 'squaddies', 'LSD', 'then', 'torturing', 'see', 'could', 'use', 'such', 'techniques', 'Russians', 'smacked', 'more', 'plot', '34', 'X-Files', '34', 'reality', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'whole', 'angle', 'soldiers', 'question', 'being', 'gay', 'being', 'forced', 'reveal', '34', 'evil', 'British', 'Army', 'officer.', '34', 'whole', 'thing', 'smacked', 'political', 'correctness.', '60', 'end', 'spoilers', 'final', 'episode', 'set', '34', 'Gently', 'Going', '34', 'was', 'good', 'one', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'setting', 'murder', 'deep', 'coal', 'mine', 'was', 'pretty', 'creative', 'complex', 'family', 'relationships', 'were', 'critical', 'story', 'were', 'bit', 'confusing', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'explained', 'whole', 'thing', 'make', 'sure', 'understood', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'on.This', 'being', 'said', 'will', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'set', 'Gently', 'stories', 'One', 'major', 'development', 'late', '1960s', 'early', '1970s', 'hope', 'use', 'future', 'story', 'Northern', 'Ireland', '1969', 'whole', 'place', 'went', 'up', 'flames', '1972', 'Belfast', 'was', 'war', 'zone', 'would', 'cool', 'see', 'Gently', 'Bacchus', 'deal', 'spillover', 'took', 'place', 'Home', 'Islands']","George Gently, Series 6"

The show centers on Chief Inspector George Gently, one of the few good men at Scotland Yard, and an old school copper. On the eve of his retirement, the world-weary cop decides to pursue one final murder case, suspecting that it was done by a gangster who's already gotten away with the murder of Gently's own wife. So, as played by the sixty-something Tony nominated Martin Shaw, Gently relocates to Northumberland, in the North East of England, tucked in just below Hadrian's Wall, a relic of the Roman occupation of Britain a millennium or so ago.  Gently takes on a headstrong sidekick (Lee Ingleby); starts solving murders in a time of profound change: the 1960s. The series is based on Alan Hunter's novels.  In DVD format, there is a 4-disc boxed set, running approximately 369 minutes, plus some bonus footage of behind the scenes footage, text interviews with the cast, 1969 facts, and photo gallery. (In Blu-Ray format, there are 2 discs.)  And, praises be, thanks to RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles.  Or how would anyone on this side of the pond understand a word of the local dialect?The 6th series consists of four powerful feature length episodes, one to a disk. It opens as Gently,(Martin Shaw, THE PROFESSIONALS, JUDGE JOHN DEED, THE CHIEF, DEATH IN HOLY ORDERS) and his ambitious undisciplined Sergeant John Bacchus ( Lee Ingleby, THE STREET, PLACE OF EXECUTION), who married his boss's daughter, return to the job. They were gravely injured in the line of duty six months earlier. Both officers appear to be on the mend, at least physically.  But, while Gently is determined to put the horror behind him, Bacchus is not, and has shocked his boss by submitting a letter of resignation.  The episodes, to quote RLJ/Acorn, are:Disc 1Episode 1: Gently between the LinesGently investigates a death in police custody--and insists that Bacchus assist him, even though his sergeant has just submitted his formal resignation. In the process, the inspector has to tread a careful path between fellow officers who are closing ranks in support of each other and a local population grown increasingly hostile towards the police.Disc 2Episode 2: Blue for BluebirdThe body of a young woman washed up on the beach turns the attentions of Gently and Bacchus to the nearby holiday camp where she worked. The once-thriving business is clearly in trouble, with fewer and fewer families visiting each summer. The detectives discover the lengths to which some are prepared to go to keep the camp afloat.Disc 3Episode 3: Gently with HonourWhen a man is beaten to death in a Turkish bath, suspicion falls on an ex-soldier with a history of mental instability. But the mystery deepens when a psychologist who had been treating the suspect hangs himself after leaving money to the soldier in his will. World War II veteran Gently finds himself investigating a murder that makes no sense and a military he no longer understands.Disc 4Episode 4: Gently Going UnderThe death of a coal miner 800 feet underground presents logistical problems for Gently and Bacchus. More challenging still is figuring out which of the tensions and rivalries raging above the surface--between labor and management, in the local community, and among the members of the dead man's family--is a motive for murder.Gently sometimes seems a bit of a fish out of water: he seems to spend less time fighting crime in bleak Durham County than battling racism, sexism, corruption and narrow-mindedness, often in the police department.  Where, when his colleagues aren't taking ""backhanders"" (bribes), they can  be found harassing or beating up their Arab, black, mentally or physically disabled or Pakistani neighbors.  In fact, the negative attitude of the series to  police work might make a viewer wonder just why the veteran cop ever joined the service, let alone stayed so long.  The viewer must assume it's his passion for justice.A distinguished cast gives us uniformly fine acting.  Shaw, whom many viewers consider to be the best actor ever to play Adam Dalgleish in the televised versions of P.D. James' crime novels, has the chops and the gravitas to play Gently, and to carry the show.  He and Ingleby play off each other with warmth and humor.  Guest stars include Jemma Redgrave (BRAMWELL) and Robert Pugh (GAME OF THRONES).  Author Alan Hunter set his work in East Anglia, around Norfolk, where he grew up; however, the television series has been set in a more northerly latitude.  The production has been filmed around Durham and in Ireland.  The 1960s were, of course, a very eventful era: the tense political climate of the Cold War; then, attitudes and values begin to change as the Swinging Sixties belatedly hit the North East, a process the scripts show in fine detail.  The series is shot in high definition; scripts are witty and ingenious, direction is stylish.  Rural Britain - or is it Ireland--provides a beautiful backdrop for the action.  The series, which has been compared to FOYLES WAR  and MIDSOMER MURDERS,  offers many excellent reasons to love it, and I do.",5,Offers Many Excellent Reasons to Love It,1399593600,"05 9,
