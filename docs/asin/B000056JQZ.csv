Most of the time when you know the back ground of a singer or star actor, actress it give you a feel of what the person has gone thru and when things bad happen to can understand why.  A lot of times we as people think that they are super stars with no floss but not true, i would say yes please buy this movie you will enjoy.",4,livin for love respond,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",2013,441,"['movie', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'good', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'took', 'place', 'Natalie', 'Coles', 'life', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'Most', 'time', 'when', 'know', 'back', 'ground', 'singer', 'star', 'actor', 'give', 'feel', 'what', 'person', 'gone', 'thru', 'when', 'things', 'bad', 'happen', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'times', 'people', 'think', 'are', 'super', 'stars', 'floss', 'not', 'true', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'yes', 'please', 'buy', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy']",Livin' For Love - The Natalie Cole Story VHS

I wished that it was on a dvd instead of a VHS, but it's better than nothing. I first saw this movie on television. It's a shame that we sometimes fill the void in our lives with something that will kill us slowly, but quickly as well. We get a chance, and we give it back to the world, to the devil.

I was never able to see the entire movie and the bits and pieces I saw are almost out of my memory.  This movie was purchased for a friend and maybe one day she'll invite me over to watch it.  I could go for that and some nacho's.

It goes to show that you can have it all and still throw it away. Natalie didn't won't to live in her father's shawdow are be known as Nat King Coles daughter. But thats who she is. And that's nothing wrong with that. I love to hear him sing the christmas song. Because it feels like christmas is almost here.

569558,AXHMUN6GC0WEH,B000056JQZ,"The Fancy One ""blackprincess""","[15, 15]","Natalie Cole's story, which was based on her best-selling autobiography, comes to vivid life on screen. Like Ms. Cole's book, this movie pulls no punches about the seemingly fairytale life she had as a child to her bouts with drugs, her rise to fame as a singing star, her family life, only for it to all come crashing down due to her addiction--and her amazing comeback due to the one thing she was running away from all her life: acknowledging the legacy of her father, the legendary pop/jazz artist, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, who had died a tragic death from lung cancer at the age of 45. At the time of his death, Natalie had just turned 15, and has said that his death was something she never got over, but never had the chance to grieve, which  eventually led her to drugs. That, and the need to be daring and experimental. But she explains that it wasn't until the mid-80s when she was in rehab for the second time that she realized this. Bottom line was, she missed her father tremendously.Diahann Carroll is fantastic as Maria Cole, Natalie's strict disciplinarian mother, and James McDaniel captures the gentle and understanding man that Nat Cole was perfectly, even though his role is not a large one. The two young actresses who play Natalie as a child are enchanting, and Theresa Randle as the young adult Natalie pulls out all the stops for a Emmy-deserving performance.One of the most touching and true scenes in the movie is when Natalie, playing herself, has to break the news to her young son right before a concert that his father has passed away, then she goes on stage and dedicates her hit song &quot;Our Love&quot; to her former husband. The emotion is very real, and you can tell that Natalie was reliving the pain she must've felt then. Also at the very end of the film, you see real footage of Natalie singing the smash &quot;Unforgettable&quot; with Nat on video at the 1992 Grammy awards. Another heart-touching moment. It also shows the ups and downs of the music industry and how certain situations are handled and overcome. A phenomenal story. Highly recommended! Now if only we can bring Nat's story to the screen....",5,&quot;This Will Be&quot; a great video to own!,978825600,"01 7, 2001",2001,2150,"['Natalie', 'Cole', 'story', 'was', 'based', 'best-selling', 'autobiography', 'vivid', 'life', 'screen', 'Ms.', 'Cole', 'book', 'movie', 'punches', 'seemingly', 'fairytale', 'life', 'had', 'child', 'bouts', 'drugs', 'rise', 'fame', 'singing', 'star', 'family', 'life', 'only', 'come', 'crashing', 'down', 'due', 'addiction', 'amazing', 'comeback', 'due', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'running', 'away', 'life', 'acknowledging', 'legacy', 'father', 'legendary', 'pop/jazz', 'artist', 'Nat', 'quot', 'King', 'quot', 'Cole', 'who', 'had', 'died', 'tragic', 'death', 'lung', 'cancer', 'age', '45', 'time', 'death', 'Natalie', 'had', 'just', 'turned', '15', 'said', 'death', 'was', 'something', 'never', 'got', 'over', 'never', 'had', 'chance', 'grieve', 'eventually', 'led', 'drugs', 'need', 'be', 'daring', 'experimental', 'was', ""n't"", 'mid-80s', 'when', 'was', 'rehab', 'second', 'time', 'realized', 'Bottom', 'line', 'was', 'missed', 'father', 'tremendously.Diahann', 'Carroll', 'fantastic', 'Maria', 'Cole', 'Natalie', 'strict', 'disciplinarian', 'mother', 'James', 'McDaniel', 'gentle', 'understanding', 'man', 'Nat', 'Cole', 'was', 'perfectly', 'even', 'role', 'not', 'large', 'one', 'two', 'young', 'actresses', 'who', 'play', 'Natalie', 'child', 'are', 'enchanting', 'Theresa', 'Randle', 'young', 'adult', 'Natalie', 'out', 'stops', 'Emmy-deserving', 'performance.One', 'most', 'touching', 'true', 'scenes', 'movie', 'when', 'Natalie', 'playing', 'break', 'news', 'young', 'son', 'right', 'concert', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'then', 'stage', 'hit', 'song', 'quot', 'Love', 'quot', 'former', 'husband', 'emotion', 'very', 'real', 'can', 'tell', 'Natalie', 'was', 'reliving', 'pain', 'must', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'then', 'Also', 'very', 'end', 'film', 'see', 'real', 'footage', 'Natalie', 'singing', 'smash', 'quot', 'Unforgettable', 'quot', 'Nat', 'video', '1992', 'Grammy', 'awards', 'heart-touching', 'moment', 'also', 'ups', 'downs', 'music', 'industry', 'how', 'certain', 'situations', 'are', 'handled', 'overcome', 'phenomenal', 'story', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'Now', 'only', 'can', 'bring', 'Nat', 'story', 'screen']",Livin' For Love - The Natalie Cole Story VHS
