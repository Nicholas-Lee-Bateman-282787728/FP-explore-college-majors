965074,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B000E1EHQI,Alex Udvary,"[12, 20]","While I admit Buster Keaton is not my favorite of the silent slapstick clowns (Chaplin is my favorite) he nonetheless remains a source of inspiration for me when I make my own movies. I enjoy his comedies very much and have a great amount of respect and appreciation for his work. I'm such a big fan of Keaton's and all the great comedians from his era that I even defend their lesser known and appreciated titles. I have went out of my way to sing the praises of Keaton's talking comedies such as ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"", ""The Passionate Plumber"" and ""Speak Easily"" when no one else would dare to.I admit the talking comedies are not on the same level as the silent ones. Not only are some of Keaton's silent pictures some of the funniest comedies of all-time they are also some of the greatest films ever made. ""The General"", ""Sherlock, Jr."" and ""Our Hospitality"" are prime examples. My own favorite Keaton comedy is ""The Battling Butler"" (a lesser known silent Keaton comedy). But I've continued to watch his talking pictures because I don't like the attitude that exist when it comes to comedians. So many people have the prejudice idea that once you grow older you are no longer funny. I personally do not buy into that philosophy.But, having said all of that and having fully explained my feelings on Buster Keaton I must conclude this DVD, while surely worth owning if a Keaton fan, is an absolute disgrace and shows Keaton at the low-point of his career. The comedies presented here, there are ten in total, are all lack-luster, disgusting, worthless, over-the-top pieces of junk. And I say that with all due respect.The fault though is not Keaton's, as odd as that may sound. The problem with these shorts lies with the director Jules White, who has proven to me to be the worst comedy director of all-time. White, if you are unfamiliar with the name, directed the Three Stooges shorts for Columbia pictures. I've never been a fan of the Stooges but many of you I'm sure are familiar with their style of comedy. Jules White directs all these shorts as if they were Stooges' comedies not Buster Keaton comedies. What this proves is the fact that White was a director who could only direct in one style, no matter what. I guess White never watched a Keaton comedy before because he takes little advantage of Keaton's strenghts. All of these comedies are far too physical for Keaton. I know what some of you are thinking. Hey Alex, you moron, don't you know that Buster Keaton was a slapstick comedian? All of his comedy was physical. Yes, it's true Keaton did a lot of visual gags, but, if you think that's all Keaton did, then you my friend are sadly mistaken. And even if Keaton did purely visual gags, the comedy in these shorts is not the kind of comedy Keaton excelled at. The comedy here consist of people beating each other up. People bumping their heads against objects, falling into one another, and such. Basically your typical Three Stooges' comedy.What Jules White needed to do was take advantage of what Keaton could do best and set the pieces around that. All of the shorts were written by veteran comedy writers of the silent era. Clyde Bruckman and Felix Adler worked on many of the shorts here. Bruckman in particular worked with Keaton on many projects including some of Keaton's best ""The General"", ""Sherlock, Jr."", ""The Cameraman"" and ""Our Hospitality"". And I believe wrote just about all of the shorts in this collection.Felix Adler on the other hand worked often with Harold Lloyd and Laurel and Hardy. With Lloyd, Adler worked on his talking films including ""Welcome Danger"", ""Feet First"", and ""Movie Crazy"". He also wrote my favorite Laurel and Hardy comedy ""Way Out West"". So both men knew what was funny. And because the writers knew what was funny I can only blame Jules White for destroying these shorts with his brain-dead ideas on comedy.Many of the pieces here deserve only one star. Shorts such as ""Nothing But Pleasure"", ""General Nuisance"", ""Mooching Through Georgia"" and ""His Ex Marks The Spot"" are true low-points of comedy. But not all of the shorts are as bad as the ones mentioned. The best of the pack might be ""She's Oil Mine"" in it Keaton plays a plumber who gets mixed up in fighting a duel. The gags come pretty fast and while I admit the humor, as in all of the shorts, is not typical Keaton humor, this one actually made me laugh. I give it two out of five stars.""Pardon My Berth Marks"" also has some funny moments despite Jules White. It has Keaton as a wannabe reporter who is sent to cover a big divorce case. While again the humor is a bit crude for Keaton some of it is kinda, sorta, funny.""Pest From The West"" and ""Spook Speaks"" get one and a half stars out of me but when compared to the other shorts here are highlights. The rest of the pieces are all one star.It should also be pointed out Jules White does not direct all ten shorts on this DVD (thank God!) Two of them were directed by Del Lord (""So You Won't Squawk"" and ""Pest From The West"") ""Squawk"" is the better of the two. My rating for it is two out of five stars.So just to quickly recap here are my ratings for all the shorts in this collection; ""General Nuisance"" (* out of *****), ""His Ex Marks The Spot"" (* out of *****), ""Mooching Through Georgia"" (* out of *****), ""Nothing But Pleasure"" (* out of *****), ""Pardon My Berth Marks"" (** out of *****), ""Pest From The West"" (* 1/2 out of *****), ""She's Oil Mine"" (** out of *****), ""So You Won't Squawk"" (** out of *****), ""Spook Speaks"" (* 1/2 out of *****), and ""The Taming Of The Snood"" (* out of *****)Bottom-line: Truly terrible, worthless, dull, boring Buster Keaton shorts that were destroyed not by Keaton, who does all he can to make these work, but by director Jules White. He proves in these shorts what kind of good-for-nothing, no talented director he really was!",2,Buster Keaton and Jules White = Bad Comedy,1143849600,"04 1, 2006",2006,5851,"['admit', 'Buster',

I am glad I listened to the favourable comments as this is a set that I am very glad to own.I know that Buster was not necessarily proud of his work at Columbia (he called the Columbia shorts ""Cheaters"") and that was due to a couple of reasons.  They would not give him the time to develop storylines and they would not give him the money.  The director on 8 of the 10 shorts was Jules White(of 3 Stooges fame), who was not sympathic to Buster's form of comedy, but Buster needed the money. Having said that I have to add that within all these shorts are moments of Keaton's magic and that is why they are worth watching and owning.A couple of stand outs here in my opinion are ""Pest from the West"" (which was his first Columbia short) and ""Mooching Through Georgia"".  There is excellent and informative commentary on all these shorts and a very interesting documentary to show how Buster came to be making these shorts.  I would not recommend these to new Buster fans, I would say get his classics first, including his Arbuckle Shorts.Lastly on a Region note I live in Australia and I had no trouble playing this DVD on my multi region DVD player.",3,Keaton Still Weaves His Magic,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1307,"['Having', 'never', 'seen', 'Columbia', 'Shorts', 'purchasing', 'set', 'relied', 'entirely', 'other', 'comments', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'favourable', 'others', 'were', 'am', 'glad', 'listened', 'favourable', 'comments', 'set', 'am', 'very', 'glad', 'own.I', 'know', 'Buster', 'was', 'not', 'necessarily', 'proud', 'work', 'Columbia', 'called', 'Columbia', 'Cheaters', 'was', 'due', 'couple', 'reasons', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'time', 'develop', 'storylines', 'would', 'not', 'give', 'money', 'director', '8', '10', 'shorts', 'was', 'Jules', 'White', '3', 'Stooges', 'fame', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'sympathic', 'Buster', 'form', 'comedy', 'Buster', 'needed', 'money', 'Having', 'said', 'have', 'add', 'shorts', 'are', 'moments', 'Keaton', 'magic', 'why', 'are', 'worth', 'watching', 'owning.A', 'couple', 'stand', 'outs', 'here', 'opinion', 'are', 'Pest', 'West', 'was', 'first', 'Columbia', 'short', 'Mooching', 'Through', 'Georgia', 'excellent', 'informative', 'commentary', 'shorts', 'very', 'interesting', 'documentary', 'show', 'how', 'Buster', 'came', 'be', 'making', 'shorts', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'new', 'Buster', 'fans', 'would', 'say', 'get', 'classics', 'first', 'including', 'Arbuckle', 'Shorts.Lastly', 'Region', 'note', 'live', 'Australia', 'had', 'trouble', 'playing', 'DVD', 'multi', 'region', 'DVD', 'player']",N/A

These films have always had a pretty bad reputation, but they are amusing enough, especially for a Keaton completist. The problem is that Jules White's brand of comedy that worked so well for the Three Stooges was just not suited to Buster. White was head of the Columbia shorts department at the time, and he had a tendency to be autocratic. Buster ceased making shorts for Columbia after he decided he just couldn't go on working this way in spite of the fact that his financial position was still not good at this time.The commentaries on the ten shorts are very good. The commenters are quite knowledgable about Keaton and his career as well as Columbia's supporting comedy players, and don't limit themselves to the things that every Keaton fan already knows. Neither are they shy about mentioning the shortcomings of Buster's Columbia shorts. Included is a shooting script from ""She's Oil Mine"" with a forward by Melissa Talmadge Cox, Buster's granddaughter. There is also a mini documentary on Keaton's career on the second disc. If you already know Buster's story there's nothing new here, but it is still well done.You'll notice that Keaton recycles gags from many of his earlier films, from his silent films up through his MGM talkies. Everybody did this, the trick was to do it well, and Buster does. Without home video or television, once a film stopped its short run in the theaters it was forgotten, and largely so were the gags. This is how comics got away with this.",3,This set won't make you a Buster fan...,1209772800,"05 3, 2008",2008,1743,"['wo', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'becoming', 'one', 'either.Buster', 'did', 'short', 'films', 'Columbia', '1939', '1941', 'pace', 'production', 'was', 'frantic', 'was', 'really', 'time', 'Keaton', 'finesse', 'see', 'Buster', 'short', 'silent', 'films', '20', 'films', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'pretty', 'bad', 'reputation', 'are', 'amusing', 'enough', 'especially', 'Keaton', 'completist', 'problem', 'Jules', 'White', 'brand', 'comedy', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'suited', 'Buster', 'White', 'was', 'head', 'Columbia', 'department', 'time', 'had', 'tendency', 'be', 'autocratic', 'Buster', 'ceased', 'making', 'shorts', 'Columbia', 'decided', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'go', 'working', 'way', 'spite', 'fact', 'financial', 'position', 'was', 'still', 'not', 'good', 'time.The', 'commentaries', 'ten', 'shorts', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'commenters', 'are', 'quite', 'knowledgable', 'Keaton', 'career', 'as', 'well', 'Columbia', 'supporting', 'comedy', 'players', 'do', ""n't"", 'limit', 'things', 'Keaton', 'fan', 'already', 'are', 'shy', 'mentioning', 'shortcomings', 'Buster', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'Included', 'shooting', 'script', 'Oil', 'Mine', 'forward', 'Melissa', 'Talmadge', 'Cox', 'Buster', 'granddaughter', 'also', 'mini', 'documentary', 'Keaton', 'career', 'second', 'disc', 'already', 'know', 'Buster', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'here', 'still', 'well', 'done.You', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'Keaton', 'gags', 'many', 'earlier', 'films', 'silent', 'films', 'up', 'MGM', 'talkies', 'Everybody', 'did', 'trick', 'was', 'do', 'well', 'Buster', 'home', 'video', 'television', 'once', 'film', 'stopped', 'short', 'run', 'theaters', 'was', 'forgotten', 'largely', 'so', 'were', 'gags', 'how', 'comics', 'got', 'away']",N/A
965077,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,B000E1EHQI,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[30, 31]","A treat for Keaton Fans.  Not his best work, but some very entertaining moments can be found in these shorts.Keaton made some of the funniest, most inventive, and witty silent shorts and features of all time.  He didn't just come up with a smart sight gag, he played with audience expectations and often found an extra twist.  Along the way he experimented with camera tricks, techniques and much more.  He wasn't merely a clown, but an artist.  Many already know this.In the late 1920's and early 1930s, Keaton was under contract to MGM.  They took away a lot of his creative control and forced him to star in stage adaptations and team up with Jimmy Durante in a couple of movies.  Keaton was having some personal problems as well, and his drinking was out of control. The movies weren't funny, weren't popular and he was more and more difficult to work with. His career was at a low point by the mid 1930s. He was let go from MGM.By the late 1930s he had stopped drinking and his personal life was much happier.  Columbia convinced him to do a series of  sound shorts under the direction of people like Del Lord and Jules White.  The shorts were made between 1939 to 1941 at Columbia Pictures utilizing the same crews and directors as Columbia's 3 Stooges shorts.  Keaton fans will find a still very agile 45 year acrobatic Keaton able to create magic moments.  The budgets were small and the shooting schedule was usually confined to 3 days.  Some of the shorts were not written with Keaton in mind, but there are moments in every single offering where Keaton's skill and experience shine.Ten shorts have been collected on the two discs (they are not arranged chronologically here-who knows why) among the gems are  Pest from the West (a solid abridged remake of the mostly awful feature film he did in the U.K. called:  ""The Invader "" aka ""An Old Spanish Custom). He re-stages part of his old vaudeville act in the short  ""Taming of the Snood"".  There's a very funny Keaton classic routine (with a slight twist) in ""Nothing but Pleasure"".  A wonderful little bit of dance choreography makes ""General Nuisance"" enjoyable, ""So You Won't Squawk"" has several fun sequences and good use of a stock chase scene, and the best of the shorts is the last one he did for Columbia called ""She's Oil Mine"" which finishes off with one of the best versions he's ever done of his famous `duel scene'.These were cheap quickly made comedies cranked out by Columbia's short division. The schedule frustrated Keaton who felt with a few more shooting days on each short he could have improved them.  They wanted him to make more, but he decided to not re-new his contract.  He successfully stopped drinking, found a life partner, and  led a modest life behind the scenes (writing gags for other stars-particularly Red Skeleton) for nearly a decade.  Then by the 1950s he had been re-discovered and made many appearances on television, did numerous live shows and eventually made industrial films, appeared in small roles in several movies, and was moved by how many people re-discovered and enjoyed his old silent films.The DVD's include commentaries by a few film scholars and genuine fan club folks that run on each of the shorts.  They give you some interesting perspective and some fun trivia notes if you care to listen to them.  For the DVD collection a new mini-documentary was created that gives a retrospective of Keaton's transition from silent movies to MGM talkies to the making of these Columbia shorts.  The documentary takes the honest view that these films were not nearly as good as the silent shorts and while entertaining, Keaton was not proud of his work on these with the exception of  ""Pest from the West' and `She's Oil Mine'.Don't expect the best of Keaton here, but if you are a fan, there's a lot here to enjoy.

I was thrilled to see that Columbia was finally releasing all of his sound shorts he made for their studio.While both his Educational and Columbia shorts have always had a reputation as being nothing but crap, that was not the case upon viewing them for the first time. The films offer the same quality of material that can bee seen in their Three Stooges shorts, and Keaton himself was still a talented screen comedian able to sell even the simplest joke. There are laughs in these movies, but just don't expect the quality of his earlier work.The Columbia shorts had little budget and were shot on a three day schedule. Keaton himself thought that if they had allowed him more time on each short then he could have made them masterpieces. Some of the shorts were remakes of his feature films, and one of them, ""The Pest From The West"", was not only a remake of ""The Invader"" but the only one of the Columbia shorts that Buster was happy with. [ ""The Invader"" itself, one of the last feature films that Buster was given creative control over,  was plagued with a disastrously low budget and turned out to be a misfire for Keaton. ""Pest From The West"" gave him a chance to finally get that film right, even if 40 minutes shorter. ]The discs themselves do not offer the movies in chronological order, but it seems as if someone decided to have the less appealing movies first then build to the movies with the most laughs. They are quality prints but in at least one film, ""His Ex Marks The Spot"", there is some question to if some footage is missing or if the strange edits were on the final release prints as seen in the theaters. As these films were made cheap and fast I would not expect there to be any existing material for any extras. Columbia has, however, provided their own documentary made exclusively for the DVD which talks about Keaton's transition from silent to sound films. Surprisingly the documentary admits that these films were no where as good as the silent shorts and were considered a low point artistically for Buster. The documentary's only shortcoming is that there are very few behind the scene details about the Columbia shorts. Each short also has its own commentary track by various film historians.This brings us to the packaging. There have been many complaints by Keaton fans that the packaging is misleading. The cover shows a picture of Keaton from the 1920's and the back cover has a cartoon image of Keaton from ""The Cameraman"". Only in very small pictures on the back do we see a 45 year old Keaton in stills from the shorts. True this is misleading, but to whom? Non Keaton fans would not realize the difference and would probably get a kick out of the movies without knowing that there are better silent shorts out there. Keaton fans would already own all the existing silent era movies and would certainly know in a moment from reading the description and movies listed on the back that these are the later Columbia shorts. In fact the packaging itself could probably drive off potential buyers who mistake it for another re-release of the silent films they already own. More likely the reason why these pictures were used in the first place was that they were public domain. None of the publicity stills I have seen for the Columbia shorts has a typical image of Buster that could be used on the box's cover. And then there is a question as to who owns the rights to Buster Keaton's image. I know that in the case of Laurel & Hardy, Larry Harmon owns those rights which is why Image was limited to the same picture for most of their DVD and Laserdisc releases while other L&H; movies had B&W; plublicity photos repainted or colorized for the boxes cover. Any new image of Laurel & Hardy could not be done without Harmon's permission. I don't know if the same kind of rules play into Keaton's, but if such rules exist then it could legally limit what Columbia can put on their box.",3,"Not as bad as movie historians said they were, the  Columbia shorts proved that Keaton could still provide laughs in lame films.",1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,4386,"['fan', 'BUSTER', 'KEATON', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'collection', 'works', 'not', 'just', '19', 'shorts', '11', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'starred', 'silent', 'era', 'even', 'were', 'best', 'past', 'have', 'bought', 'Laserdisc', 'box', 'sets', 'MGM', 'sound', 'movies', 'as', 'well', 'earlier', 'work', 'Arbuckle', 'shorts', 'am', 'still', 'waiting', 'foreign', 'work', 'become', 'available', 'country', 'as', 'well', 'Educational', 'shorts', '50', 'Television', 'series', 'was', 'thrilled', 'see', 'Columbia', 'was', 'finally', 'releasing', 'sound', 'made', 'studio.While', 'Educational', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'have', 'always', 'had', 'reputation', 'being', 'nothing', 'crap', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'films', 'offer', 'same', 'quality', 'material', 'can', 'bee', 'seen', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'Keaton', 'was', 'still', 'talented', 'screen', 'comedian', 'able', 'sell', 'even', 'simplest', 'joke', 'are', 'laughs', 'movies', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'quality', 'earlier', 'work.The', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'had', 'little', 'budget', 'were', 'shot', 'three', 'day', 'schedule', 'Keaton', 'thought', 'had', 'allowed', 'more', 'time', 'short', 'then', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'masterpieces', 'shorts', 'were', 'remakes', 'feature', 'films', 'one', 'Pest', 'West', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'remake', 'Invader', 'only', 'one', 'Columbia', 'Buster', 'was', 'happy', '[', 'Invader', 'one', 'last', 'feature', 'films', 'Buster', 'was', 'given', 'creative', 'control', 'was', 'plagued', 'disastrously', 'low', 'budget', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'misfire', 'Keaton', 'Pest', 'West', 'gave', 'chance', 'finally', 'get', 'film', 'right', 'even', '40', 'minutes', 'shorter', ']', 'discs', 'do', 'not', 'offer', 'movies', 'chronological', 'order', 'someone', 'decided', 'have', 'less', 'appealing', 'movies', 'first', 'then', 'build', 'movies', 'most', 'laughs', 'are', 'quality', 'prints', 'least', 'one', 'film', 'Ex', 'Spot', 'question', 'footage', 'missing', 'strange', 'edits', 'were', 'final', 'release', 'prints', 'seen', 'theaters', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'cheap', 'fast', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'be', 'existing', 'material', 'extras', 'Columbia', 'however', 'provided', 'own', 'documentary', 'made', 'exclusively', 'DVD', 'Keaton', 'transition', 'silent', 'sound', 'films', 'Surprisingly', 'documentary', 'films', 'were', 'no', 'where', 'as', 'good', 'silent', 'shorts', 'were', 'considered', 'low', 'point', 'artistically', 'Buster', 'documentary', 'only', 'shortcoming', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'scene', 'details', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'short', 'also', 'own', 'commentary', 'track', 'various', 'film', 'historians.This', 'packaging', 'have', 'been', 'many', 'complaints', 'Keaton', 'fans', 'packaging', 'misleading', 'cover', 'picture', 'Keaton', '1920', 'back', 'cover', 'cartoon', 'image', 'Keaton', 'Cameraman', 'Only', 'very', 'small', 'pictures', 'back', 'do', 'see', '45', 'year', 'old', 'Keaton', 'stills', 'shorts', 'True', 'misleading', 'whom', 'Non', 'Keaton', 'fans', 'would', 'not', 'realize', 'difference', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'kick', 'movies', 'knowing', 'are', 'better', 'silent', 'shorts', 'there', 'Keaton', 'fans', 'would', 'already', 'own', 'existing', 'silent', 'era', 'movies', 'would', 'certainly', 'know', 'moment', 'reading', 'description', 'movies', 'listed', 'back', 'are', 'later', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'fact', 'packaging', 'could', 'probably', 'drive', 'off', 'potential', 'buyers', 'who', 'mistake', 're-release', 'silent', 'films', 'already', 'own', 'More', 'likely', 'reason', 'why', 'pictures', 'were', 'used', 'first', 'place', 'was', 'were', 'public', 'domain', 'None', 'publicity', 'have', 'seen', 'Columbia', 'typical', 'image', 'Buster', 'could', 'be', 'used', 'box', 'cover', 'then', 'question', 'who', 'rights', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'image', 'know', 'case', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Larry', 'Harmon', 'rights', 'why', 'Image', 'was', 'limited', 'same', 'picture', 'most', 'DVD', 'Laserdisc', 'releases', 'other', 'L', 'H', 'movies', 'had', 'B', 'W', 'plublicity', 'photos', 'repainted', 'colorized', 'boxes', 'cover', 'new', 'image', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'done', 'Harmon', 'permission', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'same', 'kind', 'rules', 'play', 'Keaton', 'such', 'rules', 'exist', 'then', 'could', 'legally', 'limit', 'what', 'Columbia', 'can', 'put', 'box']",N/A
965079,A3JTAUXHZQN092,B000E1EHQI,"Dean Wisland ""Titanic buff""","[7, 7]","After making short films for a studio called Educational, Buster Keaton signed on with Columbia to make short films. He would make 10 from 1939 to 1941. Most were directed by Jules White, best known for his work with the Three Stooges. Del Lord, who worked for Mack Sennet in the 1920's directed two. Clyde Bruckman, who worked with Buster in the 20's and who would also write and direct films for such stars as Laurel and Hardy and the Three Stooges. The films are no where near as good as the films Buster made in the 1920's. However, if you take this films on their own merit, they are fun and entertaing to watch. Buster, despite the sometimes weak material, always did his best. Highlights of this set are;1. Mooching through Geogria. From 1939, Buster Plays a confedrate soldier in the Civil War, and gets invoved with a plot to steal a Union battle map. The basic plot of this film would be remade by the Three Stooges in 1946 as Uncivil Warbirds. The scene where Buster is ""shot"" as a spy is almost repeated word for word.2. Pest from the West. The first short, from 1939 has Buster as a traveler in Mexico who falls for a local woman, and has to fight a duel for her. The best film here.3. Nothing but Pleasure. Here Buster and his wife take a bus to Detroit to buy a new car. They figure they can save money and have a good trip. Of course the trip is anything but pleasure. The bus trip is miserable with screaming kids and all. While staying in a motel, a drunk woman wanders into Buster,s room, and he tries to put her to bed in a bed that goes up into the wall, a very funny sequence.The rest of the films are not as good, but all have funny moments. The prints used look just fabulous, and the sound is excellent. A short documentary is included which is an overview of Buster's career with focus on the Columbia years. Also, a reproduction of a shooting script is included, which is interesting to read.Jules White once said there was so much more Columbia material above the Three Stooges, and he did'nt understand why Columbia did'nt put it out. Thanks to Sony for putting these films out, and hopefully more Columbia shorts, such as Andy Clyde, Charley Chase, and Shemp Howard will come to DVD.",4,"Not Buster's best, but still entertaining.",1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,2213,"['making', 'short', 'films', 'studio', 'called', 'Educational', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'signed', 'Columbia', 'make', 'short', 'films', 'would', 'make', '10', '1939', '1941', 'Most', 'were', 'directed', 'Jules', 'White', 'best', 'known', 'work', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Del', 'Lord', 'who', 'worked', 'Mack', 'Sennet', '1920', 'directed', 'two', 'Clyde', 'Bruckman', 'who', 'worked', 'Buster', '20', 'who', 'would', 'also', 'write', 'direct', 'films', 'such', 'stars', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'films', 'are', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'films', 'Buster', 'made', '1920', 'However', 'take', 'films', 'own', 'merit', 'are', 'fun', 'entertaing', 'watch', 'Buster', 'sometimes', 'weak', 'material', 'always', 'did', 'best', 'Highlights', 'set', 'are', '1', 'Mooching', 'Geogria', '1939', 'Buster', 'confedrate', 'soldier', 'Civil', 'War', 'invoved', 'plot', 'steal', 'Union', 'battle', 'map', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'remade', 'Three', 'Stooges', '1946', 'Uncivil', 'Warbirds', 'scene', 'where', 'Buster', 'shot', 'spy', 'almost', 'repeated', 'word', 'word.2', 'Pest', 'West', 'first', 'short', '1939', 'Buster', 'traveler', 'Mexico', 'who', 'local', 'woman', 'fight', 'duel', 'best', 'film', 'here.3', 'Nothing', 'Pleasure', 'Here', 'Buster', 'wife', 'take', 'bus', 'Detroit', 'buy', 'new', 'car', 'figure', 'can', 'save', 'money', 'have', 'good', 'trip', 'course', 'trip', 'anything', 'pleasure', 'bus', 'trip', 'miserable', 'screaming', 'kids', 'staying', 'motel', 'drunk', 'woman', 'wanders', 'Buster', 's', 'room', 'put', 'bed', 'bed', 'up', 'wall', 'very', 'funny', 'sequence.The', 'rest', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'prints', 'used', 'look', 'just', 'fabulous', 'sound', 'excellent', 'short', 'documentary', 'included', 'overview', 'Buster', 'career', 'focus', 'Columbia', 'years', 'Also', 'reproduction', 'shooting', 'script', 'included', 'interesting', 'read.Jules', 'White', 'once', 'said', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'Columbia', 'material', 'Three', 'Stooges', ""did'nt"", 'understand', 'why', 'Columbia', 'put', 'out', 'Thanks', 'Sony', 'putting', 'films', 'out', 'hopefully', 'more', 'Columbia', 'shorts', 'such', 'Andy', 'Clyde', 'Charley', 'Chase', 'Shemp', 'Howard', 'will', 'come', 'DVD']",N/A

Joe Adamson and Patricia Tobias seem completely unprepared to start -- they begin their talks haltingly, almost as if it takes a few minutes to set their brains into multi-task mode to watch a movie and talk at the same time.  But once they get in gear they do pretty well, and they share interesting information without being greasy about it.  Each commentator goes astray once in a while, yammering on about some oblique topic or obscure actor while I am wishing they would talk about the movie going on in front of me; still, the lectures are largely suitable, and there are many insights (into questions like, Why is ""Pest from the West"" SO good?).  The films do seem better and are more enjoyable the more you know about them.There is much to appreciate about Keaton's work here, and the speakers point out what is superior in these movies as well as identify the flaws.  I have watched all these films several times, and a few of them more than that.  The image and sound is first-rate, and Sony has collected the complete batch.  Turn off the sound to the first half of ""She's Oil Mine"", and you get an almost vintage Keaton-Arbuckle film (with a skinny Arbuckle).  The second half, the duel, has very funny sound with judiciously few but good lines for Buster, and is a model of how his sound films should have been made.  ""Mooching Through Georgia"" is quite good.  I think the only problem with it is that we expect so much from a Keaton film.  It was remade 7 years later by the 3 Stooges, and with them it seems like a fair movie, probably because we expect so much less from...  For those of you collecting the Stooges edition, watch ""Uncivil Warbirds"", then go back and watch ""Mooching.""  After the 3 Stooges version, you'll see that even a film over which Keaton presumably had only marginal control comes across like a classic.There are so many movies out there we need to see.  Columbia and Universal are really to be commended with their re-releases.

They all dovetail nicely without duplicating each others' effort.

965087,A16SS8HYJW7IEJ,B000E1EHQI,"Mark Pollock ""educator""","[20, 23]","Yes, you will basically buy this collection to watch it once. But then, NO Buster Keaton fan has any excuse to avoid this set, which contains many fine moments interpersed with the crummy overall quality of these films.First, let's deal with the quality of this set, seperate from the quality of the content.These films have been pretty well mastered, are clean, and have that typical crummy Columbia sound and sound effects. These were not carefully filmed or recorded, but were done well enough to be acceptable. The transfers are well done, and the commentaries are pretty good.The package is rather wierd. It's as if we aren't supposed to know what we are really getting. No mention is made of the Columbia Studio on the outside of the box at all, and the era these films were made is only apparent if you look really closely. The front picture is of a Buster who is MUCH younger than he was when he made these films, and the drawing on the back appears to not be Buster as much as James Dean. The shooting script may be the most pointless of bonus materials ever included in a set.That said, these films have been regularly crucified by various reviewers over the years. It's hard to say whether they really deserve this treatment. Sure, these are pretty weak stuff compared to Buster in his heyday, but there are some absolutely brilliant moments when Buster gets to really have some fun. ""General Nuisance"" has a particularly funny moment when Buster is doing a dance routine with a visitor, and steps into two brass spittoons. He completes his tap routine incredibly wel using the spittoons as taps! I'm not sure how many other comedians could have done this. ""Pest from the West"" is a relief from some of his worse work, and ""The Taming of the Snood"" is a rather bizarre piece that works rather well.Some other films are merely terrible. ""His Ex Marks the Spot"" probably should be on a list of films to allow to burn if the archives catch fire. ""Pardon My Berth Marks"" has a title that by itself should be shot.The other actors are pretty terrible, and Buster is often just marking time, but those good moments shine through and make it worthwhile, until you think about the actual effort it would take to watch this set and find them again. I suggest that you take good notes about what you like, and store them with the discs, so that if you ever do mistakenly watch this set again, you will be able to watch al the really good parts, and then, 20 minutes later, watch something better.4 stars for guts in releasing this.",4,"Wildly uneven, this is a one-watch special.",1155081600,"08 9, 2006",2006,2532,"['Yes', 'will', 'basically', 'buy', 'collection', 'watch', 'once', 'then', 'NO', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'fan', 'excuse', 'avoid', 'set', 'many', 'fine', 'moments', 'interpersed', 'crummy', 'overall', 'quality', 'films.First', 'let', 'deal', 'quality', 'set', 'seperate', 'quality', 'content.These', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'well', 'mastered', 'are', 'clean', 'have', 'typical', 'crummy', 'Columbia', 'sound', 'sound', 'effects', 'were', 'not', 'carefully', 'filmed', 'recorded', 'were', 'done', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'acceptable', 'transfers', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'commentaries', 'are', 'pretty', 'good.The', 'package', 'rather', 'wierd', 'are', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'know', 'what', 'are', 'really', 'getting', 'mention', 'made', 'Columbia', 'Studio', 'outside', 'box', 'era', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'only', 'apparent', 'look', 'really', 'closely', 'front', 'picture', 'Buster', 'who', 'MUCH', 'younger', 'was', 'when', 'made', 'films', 'drawing', 'back', 'not', 'be', 'Buster', 'as', 'much', 'James', 'Dean', 'shooting', 'script', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'pointless', 'bonus', 'materials', 'ever', 'included', 'set.That', 'said', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'regularly', 'crucified', 'various', 'reviewers', 'years', 'hard', 'say', 'really', 'deserve', 'treatment', 'Sure', 'are', 'pretty', 'weak', 'stuff', 'compared', 'Buster', 'heyday', 'are', 'absolutely', 'brilliant', 'moments', 'when', 'Buster', 'really', 'have', 'fun', 'General', 'Nuisance', 'particularly', 'funny', 'moment', 'when', 'Buster', 'doing', 'dance', 'routine', 'visitor', 'steps', 'two', 'brass', 'spittoons', 'tap', 'routine', 'incredibly', 'wel', 'using', 'spittoons', 'taps', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'comedians', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Pest', 'West', 'relief', 'worse', 'work', 'Taming', 'Snood', 'rather', 'bizarre', 'piece', 'rather', 'well.Some', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'merely', 'terrible', 'Ex', 'Spot', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'list', 'films', 'allow', 'burn', 'archives', 'catch', 'fire', 'Pardon', 'My', 'Berth', 'Marks', 'title', 'should', 'be', 'shot.The', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'Buster', 'often', 'just', 'marking', 'time', 'good', 'moments', 'shine', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'think', 'actual', 'effort', 'would', 'take', 'watch', 'set', 'find', 'again', 'suggest', 'take', 'good', 'notes', 'what', 'like', 'store', 'discs', 'ever', 'do', 'mistakenly', 'watch', 'set', 'again', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'really', 'good', 'parts', 'then', '20', 'minutes', 'later', 'watch', 'something', 'better.4', 'stars', 'guts', 'releasing']",N/A

965089,A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI,B000E1EHQI,"Randy E. Halford ""Comedy Fan""","[0, 0]","Survival has always been the theme in Buster Keaton's earlier work, not necessarily happy endings. And that would also serve as a reason for Buster's real life: Work is work, and Buster needed the money. Thus, in 1939, Keaton joined Columbia Pictures to do ten comedy shorts. The result? Well, remember that this is the same studio that gave us the Three Stooges. And Keaton's producer-director Jules White specialized in the head-conking, face-slapping slapstick (one imagines him directing Road Runner cartoons instead) augmented by those phony sound effects. It works for the Stooges, whose broad, rowdy humor these things became their trademark. However, it didn't always work so well for Buster, whose subtle, calculated style went beyond hitting & falling down a lot. Obviously, this was a difficult adjustment for Keaton; he had no creative control (he fared better at Educational Films because he had more input) & therefore, just had to go along with it.On the other hand, no picture is without merit, simply because Buster's in it. Although he looks far older, he could still move funny, do funny takes with that wonderful blase face, and do pratfalls like no one could. There's a gag in ""She's Oil Mine"" in which Buster gets his finger stuck in a pipe; his friend proceeds to twirl Buster around like a tire iron until the finger pops free. Now picture any other comedian trying that; only Keaton could pull that off. Recycling bits from earlier pictures (The Army examination, putting the drunk woman to bed, the duel, swinging a jack hammer & not connecting as he spins in midair like a top) sometimes worked or were pale imitations of the original. But Buster always gave it his all, so when things weren't exactly perfect, the blame could not be placed on him.He was accompanied by some very familiar faces on the Columbia lot: Vernon Dent, Bud Jamison & Eddie Laughton, to name a few. His leading ladies were either Dorothy Appleby or Elsie Ames (the latter was quite a good female clown & physical comedienne; she deserved a series of her own, and when paired with Buster, produced some wild moments). My faves? ""Mooching Through Georgia"" is a Civil War comedy that concentrates more on style & situation, with pleasing echoes of silent comedy. ""Nothing But Pleasure"" recalls Keaton's ealier ""disaster comedies"" such as ""The Boat"" as Keaton & wife encounter all kinds of frustrations travelling. ""Pest from the West"" has a funny running gag of Keaton continually falling into the drink between his yacht & the pier, and an amusing music solo.So why did I rate this collection five stars? Because it's a pivotal moment in Keaton's career, the last of a series in which he appeared regularly. After that, Keaton fell in line at the other studios to do miscellaneous appearances in both film & TV until his death in 1966.Also, there's a dandy featurette in the Special Features called ""Keaton: Silents to Shorts"" that's a must-see.Glad to own this piece of film history that finally fills in the blanks on Keaton's career!",5,The Great Stone Face in the Land of Violent Slapstick,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",2012,3036,"['Survival', 'always', 'been', 'theme', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'earlier', 'work', 'not', 'necessarily', 'happy', 'endings', 'would', 'also', 'serve', 'reason', 'Buster', 'real', 'life', 'Work', 'work', 'Buster', 'needed', 'money', 'Thus', '1939', 'Keaton', 'joined', 'Columbia', 'Pictures', 'do', 'ten', 'comedy', 'shorts', 'result', 'Well', 'remember', 'same', 'studio', 'gave', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Keaton', 'producer-director', 'Jules', 'White', 'specialized', 'head-conking', 'face-slapping', 'slapstick', 'one', 'directing', 'Road', 'Runner', 'cartoons', 'instead', 'augmented', 'phony', 'sound', 'effects', 'Stooges', 'broad', 'rowdy', 'humor', 'things', 'became', 'trademark', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Buster', 'subtle', 'calculated', 'style', 'went', 'hitting', 'falling', 'down', 'lot', 'Obviously', 'was', 'difficult', 'adjustment', 'Keaton', 'had', 'creative', 'control', 'fared', 'better', 'Educational', 'Films', 'had', 'more', 'input', 'therefore', 'just', 'had', 'go', 'along', 'it.On', 'other', 'hand', 'picture', 'merit', 'simply', 'Buster', 'far', 'older', 'could', 'still', 'move', 'funny', 'do', 'funny', 'wonderful', 'blase', 'face', 'do', 'pratfalls', 'one', 'could', 'gag', 'Oil', 'Mine', 'Buster', 'finger', 'stuck', 'pipe', 'friend', 'proceeds', 'twirl', 'Buster', 'tire', 'iron', 'finger', 'free', 'Now', 'picture', 'other', 'comedian', 'trying', 'only', 'Keaton', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'Recycling', 'bits', 'earlier', 'pictures', 'Army', 'examination', 'putting', 'drunk', 'woman', 'bed', 'duel', 'swinging', 'jack', 'hammer', 'not', 'connecting', 'midair', 'top', 'sometimes', 'worked', 'were', 'pale', 'imitations', 'original', 'Buster', 'always', 'gave', 'so', 'when', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'perfect', 'blame', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'placed', 'him.He', 'was', 'accompanied', 'very', 'familiar', 'Columbia', 'lot', 'Vernon', 'Dent', 'Bud', 'Jamison', 'Eddie', 'Laughton', 'name', 'few', 'leading', 'ladies', 'were', 'either', 'Dorothy', 'Appleby', 'Elsie', 'Ames', 'latter', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'female', 'clown', 'physical', 'comedienne', 'deserved', 'series', 'own', 'when', 'paired', 'Buster', 'produced', 'wild', 'moments', 'faves', 'Mooching', 'Through', 'Georgia', 'Civil', 'War', 'comedy', 'more', 'style', 'situation', 'pleasing', 'echoes', 'silent', 'comedy', 'Nothing', 'Pleasure', 'Keaton', 'ealier', 'disaster', 'comedies', 'such', 'Boat', 'Keaton', 'wife', 'encounter', 'kinds', 'frustrations', 'travelling', 'Pest', 'West', 'funny', 'running', 'gag', 'Keaton', 'continually', 'falling', 'drink', 'yacht', 'pier', 'amusing', 'music', 'solo.So', 'why', 'did', 'rate', 'collection', 'five', 'stars', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'Keaton', 'career', 'last', 'series', 'appeared', 'regularly', 'Keaton', 'fell', 'line', 'other', 'studios', 'do', 'miscellaneous', 'appearances', 'film', 'TV', 'death', '1966.Also', 'dandy', 'featurette', 'Special', 'Features', 'called', 'Keaton', 'Silents', 'Shorts', 'must-see.Glad', 'own', 'piece', 'film', 'history', 'finally', 'blanks', 'Keaton', 'career']",N/A

these films have been given a thorough going over and are in the best shape I have ever seen them in.Kudos  to Sony for doing the proper job and presenting these wonderful shorts as they should be.The set itself I thought was rather sparse in its' extras.There is a repro script included for ""She's Oil Mine"" but the intro by Keatons' granddaughter contains a lovely fau pauz when she states that Sony is releasing these movies that were ""some of the first 'talkies' of the 1930s..."".As Oliver Hardy would've so cleverly put it:""I have NOTHING to say!"".There is also a less than 25 minute featurette containing the usual inane and somewhat trivial commentary on Busters' film career.Been there,done that and MUCH better than this.It is amazing who qualifies these days as writers/historians and ultimate experts on a given topic.And if I hear one more time from some ""expert"" about how Busters' works contain so much symbolism and socialogical and psychological relevance I'm ""gunna jump out the window!""(Buster in 'Limelight'!)These were nothing more or less than GREAT comedies starring a man who created an enduring character and who through his own innate genius was able to create countless laughs for the people who bought those tickets to see his works on screen.End of story.There just seems to be too many people who feel a need to philosophize when they view a comedy whether by Buster or any one else.I'll leave any Freudian or Jungian implications here to those of more higher learning than myself but may I respectfully suggest that those who feel this ""need"" please seek out some professional assistance immediately??.Remember you are not alone and this CAN be cured.Good luck!All shorts have optional commentaries by...who ARE these people,anyways?The BIG attraction of course in this wonderful set are the films themselves.The quality of each varies and many contain references to other comic's works like Fields,Lloyd and Laurel and Hardy.Not surprising considering alot of the scripting was done by comedy  vets Clyde Bruckman who worked with all three and Felix Adler who also worked with Laurel and Hardy.There are even stunt doubles for Keaton and his co-star Elsie Ames,complete with holding wires(see'Taming of the Snood"").Nobody could accuse Columbia of high production values!But for the most part Buster is here in all his glory and it is VERY pleasing to see him coming up with little throw away gags,his beautiful stare,his incomparable falls and wonderfully reworking of alot of his own gags found in previous works.Whether the short hits or misses doesn't really matter as Buster is there still showing us today what it was that made him one of the greatest comedy men of  20th century film.Buster as always transcends whatever limitations may or may not be present.This is a set tailor made for Keaton fans everwhere.Just sit and enjoy Keaton in these clear and crisp Columbia shorts.You won't be

965091,A13W29ENS208FO,B000E1EHQI,"Roger Leatherwood Brown ""roger-212""","[16, 17]","It's a great time for Keaton fans.  For some reason all the stuff that has been lost and hard to see is being released in the last year (particularly recommended is the ""Industrial Strength Keaton"" from Laughsmith Ent. for later commercials and ephemera).Keaton's ""classic"" silent era only really lasted 8 years but he worked well into the 60s after that.  After the debacle of the MGM talkies, he got drunk, dried out, got married again, and toiled at Educational for a series of very low low budget shorts in the late 30s (which I would love to see more of) and then moved on to the more ""respectable"" Columbia for these 10 shorts presented here.A couple of the Educationals are tantilizingly glimpsed on the Kino ""Keaton Plus"" disc issued a couple of years ago. They were cheap, but spirited and BK managed to do his own thing, albeit with very limited resources.  Columbia, the home of many aging comics and of the Three Stooges, had higher production values, but a more regimented way to write and shoot films, so Keaton was not able to go all out to explore his field.Frankly, most of these shorts aren't so good, but they are very interesting for two reasons - 1) they have Keaton in them, and it's great to see him able to do falls, play straight man to gags that don't really deserve him, and to see some of his old bits (many recycled by Clyde Bruckman, who wrote for Columbia, and was notorious for stealing old gags, often from himself!) redone;- 2) this set gives viewers a complete and remastered picture of what BK was doing these years, and is lovingly presented, with audio commentaries on EACH short as well as having a short docu on their making.Unfortunately they've put these shorts in alphabetical order on the 2 disks, so you should watch them as they were made (the correct list is elsewhere in these reviews) and see how Buster started with high hopes but eventually began to recycle gags.  (Beautifully, he uses much of his old vaudeville act from the teens in ""Taming of The Snood,"" the only documentation of his bit with a table, one partner and incredible agile acrobatics.  Likewise, I found ""Nothing But Pleasure"" quite enjoyable, with a classic Buster set-up and payoff with physical comedy involving a drunken woman.).""Pest from the West,"" the first one, is interesting because it's a virtual remake of his earlier UK feature, ""An Old Spanish Custom"" shortened to 17 minutes, and playing better at the shorter lenght.  I also enjoyed ""General Nuisance"" in which Buster and Elsie Ames do a great (almost silent) dance routine with pans and great choreography.  This doesn't seem to come from director Jules White, who usually directed the Stooges for Columbia.By the last film, ""She's Oil Mine,"" Buster's tone has become more aggressive; he's less eager to please and is almost combative.  (""What's wrong with you?!"")  He redoes a duel scene he had done previously for MGM.  And indeed he defiantly left Columbia after that short - he just couldn't stand doing them.The commentaries, by a myriad list of experts and fans, are fair to fascinating.  Patty Tobias, president of the International Keaton Fan Club, doesn't seem to have as much to say as the other talkers, who at least read original scripts, or had done more homework before talking.I enjoyed this disc immensely.  But I wouldn't recommend it to someone new to Buster.  I've seen the classic silents many times, and was always curious as to how he faired later at Columbia, doing shorts in an age when they were less appreciated.  Glimpses of Buster's genius and physical dexterity (as well as iconic little gestures, like his stiff wave ""goodbye,"" or falls backwards or onto his neck), pepper the shorts - just enough to keep a fan interested.  Also, there are at least two sightings of the phrase, ""How about a little dinner and a show?""Be forewarned, and enjoy the pleasures that are there to discover.",3,Another welcome piece of the Keaton puzzle from Columbia,1144108800,"04 4, 2006",2006,3899,"['great', 'time', 'Keaton', 'fans', 'reason', 'stuff', 'been', 'lost', 'hard', 'see', 'being', 'released', 'last', 'year', 'particularly', 'recommended', 'Industrial', 'Strength', 'Keaton', 'Laughsmith', 'Ent', 'later', 'commercials', 'ephemera', '.Keaton', 'classic', 'silent', 'era', 'only', 'really', 'lasted', '8', 'years', 'worked', 'well', '60s', 'debacle', 'MGM', 'talkies', 'got', 'drunk', 'dried', 'out', 'got', 'married', 'again', 'toiled', 'Educational', 'series', 'very', 'low', 'low', 'budget', 'shorts', 'late', '30s', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'then', 'moved', 'more', 'respectable', 'Columbia', '10', 'shorts', 'presented', 'here.A', 'couple', 'Educationals', 'are', 'tantilizingly', 'glimpsed', 'Kino', 'Keaton', 'Plus', 'disc', 'issued', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'cheap', 'spirited', 'BK', 'managed', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'very', 'limited', 'resources', 'Columbia', 'home', 'many', 'aging', 'comics', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'had', 'higher', 'production', 'values', 'more', 'regimented', 'way', 'write', 'shoot', 'films', 'Keaton', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'go', 'out', 'explore', 'field.Frankly', 'most', 'shorts', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'good', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'two', 'reasons', '1', 'have', 'Keaton', 'great', 'see', 'able', 'do', 'falls', 'play', 'straight', 'man', 'gags', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserve', 'see', 'old', 'bits', 'many', 'recycled', 'Clyde', 'Bruckman', 'who', 'wrote', 'Columbia', 'was', 'notorious', 'stealing', 'old', 'gags', 'often', 'redone', '2', 'set', 'viewers', 'complete', 'remastered', 'picture', 'what', 'BK', 'was', 'doing', 'years', 'lovingly', 'presented', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'EACH', 'short', 'as', 'well', 'having', 'short', 'docu', 'making.Unfortunately', ""'ve"", 'put', 'shorts', 'alphabetical', 'order', '2', 'disks', 'should', 'watch', 'were', 'made', 'correct', 'list', 'elsewhere', 'reviews', 'see', 'how', 'Buster', 'started', 'high', 'hopes', 'eventually', 'began', 'recycle', 'gags', 'Beautifully', 'much', 'old', 'vaudeville', 'act', 'teens', 'Taming', 'Snood', 'only', 'documentation', 'bit', 'table', 'one', 'partner', 'incredible', 'agile', 'acrobatics', 'Likewise', 'found', 'Nothing', 'Pleasure', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'classic', 'Buster', 'set-up', 'payoff', 'physical', 'comedy', 'involving', 'drunken', 'woman.', 'Pest', 'West', 'first', 'one', 'interesting', 'virtual', 'remake', 'earlier', 'UK', 'feature', 'Old', 'Spanish', 'Custom', 'shortened', '17', 'minutes', 'playing', 'better', 'shorter', 'lenght', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'General', 'Nuisance', 'Buster', 'Elsie', 'Ames', 'do', 'great', 'almost', 'silent', 'dance', 'routine', 'pans', 'great', 'choreography', ""n't"", 'seem', 'come', 'director', 'Jules', 'White', 'who', 'usually', 'directed', 'Stooges', 'Columbia.By', 'last', 'film', 'Oil', 'Mine', 'Buster', 'tone', 'become', 'more', 'aggressive', 'less', 'eager', 'please', 'almost', 'combative', 'What', 'wrong', 'duel', 'scene', 'had', 'done', 'previously', 'MGM', 'indeed', 'defiantly', 'left', 'Columbia', 'short', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'doing', 'them.The', 'commentaries', 'myriad', 'list', 'experts', 'fans', 'are', 'fair', 'fascinating', 'Patty', 'Tobias', 'president', 'International', 'Keaton', 'Fan', 'Club', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'say', 'other', 'talkers', 'who', 'least', 'read', 'original', 'scripts', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'homework', 'talking.I', 'enjoyed', 'disc', 'immensely', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'someone', 'new', 'Buster', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'classic', 'silents', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'always', 'curious', 'how', 'faired', 'later', 'Columbia', 'doing', 'shorts', 'age', 'when', 'were', 'less', 'appreciated', 'Glimpses', 'Buster', 'genius', 'physical', 'dexterity', 'as', 'well', 'iconic', 'little', 'gestures', 'stiff', 'wave', 'goodbye', 'backwards', 'neck', 'shorts', 'just', 'enough', 'keep', 'fan', 'interested', 'Also', 'are', 'least', 'two', 'sightings', 'phrase', 'How', 'little', 'dinner', 'show', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'enjoy', 'pleasures', 'are', 'there', 'discover']",N/A

965095,A2PAKB0NYQLCSG,B000E1EHQI,Scott MacGillivray,"[8, 8]","Bravo for Columbia consulting its considerable short-subject library and coming up with something besides The Three Stooges. Fans of ""old-time"" comedy will be very happy with this new two-DVD set, showcasing all of Buster Keaton's Columbia comedies, vintage 1939-41. The prints are stunning, with razor-sharp picture and excellent sound. It's great to have such beautiful restorations in one complete set.There are those who don't care for anything Buster did after the silent-film era, particularly the seldom-seen, low-comedy Columbias. If you're willing to give the Columbias a chance, you'll see some choice Keaton bits. Granted, most of the Columbias were directed by Stoogemeister Jules White, whose broad, blunt approach clashed with Keaton's quiet antics, but in all 10 Columbias you can depend on Buster doing something special: a spectacular acrobatic stunt, a wild visual gag, a funny pantomime reaction, a cute throwaway bit with a stray prop, an unexpected song, or a reprise of a favorite old routine.The best of the films are laugh riots. ""Pest from the West,"" directed by Keystone and Columbia stalwart Del Lord, is a magnificent short with Buster as an international traveler running afoul of a murderous Latin;  Buster's ukulele number, ""In a Little Spanish Town,"" is a scream. ""So You Won't Squawk?,"" the other Del Lord effort, has Buster mistaken for a public enemy, with an elaborate car-chase windup. ""She's Oil Mine"" is a surprisingly funny reworking of Buster's 1932 feature ""The Passionate Plumber.""Much of the material in this set is standard Columbia slapstick fare, strongly reminiscent of Jules White's Stooge shorts. You'll see many of the Stooges' supporting players (Richard Fiske, Bud Jamison, Vernon Dent, Dorothy Appleby, Bruce Bennett, Ned Glass), and you'll hear the same exaggerated sound effects punctuating the visual action. Kids will love ""The Spook Speaks,"" a regulation haunted-house comedy that could have been played by any Columbia comedian. Buster is nearly submerged in Jules White-induced mayhem in the noisy ""His Ex Marks the Spot,"" which plays like a Harry Langdon script gone astray.Still, there's much to enjoy in even the lesser films. Watch ""The Taming of the Snood"" when Buster is forced out on a window ledge -- he balances himself on the ledge, drops his arms to his sides, and plunges straight down to grab the cornice beneath him with precision, split-second timing worthy of his silent comedies. ""General Nuisance"" is an Army comedy notable for a musical number by Buster. In some of the films Buster is given a partner, each a Jules White favorite: Monty Collins is Buster's straightman in a few, and Elsie Ames joins Buster for some roughhouse acrobatics in several. If you're expecting a tired, depleted Buster Keaton going through the motions in a hapless daze, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Keaton is always working for laughs, and it's easy to see why his Columbias were very well received in the theaters.Bottom line: the Keaton Columbias are a mixed bag, nowhere nearly as ""cerebral"" as his often ingenious silents are. But if you just want some easy laughs and slapstick fun -- and a few surprises from Buster --  this set is highly recommended.",5,"Five stars for the presentation.

965098,A2049TBN63BAJA,B000E1EHQI,"W. Thielemans ""script editor extraordinaire""","[3, 3]","The Columbia shorts are much maligned, yet this set proves that this is unfair for the most part. Out of the 10 two-reelers Buster did for Columbia, at least seven are quite good. Sure, they do not reach the heights of his silent classics, and they were made on the (very) cheap. But they are very energetic and fast-moving, and even in his forties (and after a gruelling battle with alcohol and depression) Buster still busts out some very impressive physical skills. Plots don't make sense, slapstick is everywhere,  and the influence of director/producer Jules White, who was the man behind the Three Stooges shorts, is very noticeable. Yet he still allows Buster to be Buster, in most cases (not giving him too much dialogue, allowing him to rework some of his older routines in a creative way). Buster is at his worst when handling dialogue: he never sounds comfortable, his voice is scratchy and monotonous and he has a tendency to bob his head with every word he utters. Yet when he is silent, the magic is still there.Some of the shorts use Harold Lloyd-style gags, others have scenes clearly inspired by Laurel and Hardy, and several times Buster adapts the plot of  earlier (talkie) films he was in. Most successfully so in the delightful Pest from the West, a far shorter remake of his British film The Invader. It's probably the only film here which equals Buster's silent material for inventiveness and surreal humor. But there is much fun to be had with almost every film in this collection.Buster has an appealing leading lady in Dorothy Appleby, and a more... special one in Elsie Ames, who is so raucous she makes Betty Hutton seem demure. On the other hand, she has some very impressive physical skills which makes her the only female performer who could (almost) match Buster on the acrobatic front. Another recurring player is Monty Collins, who is another broad comedian with far less talent than Keaton. But in some of the shorts, they play off each other quite well (especially Mooching In Georgia, a Civil War farce).The extras are nice: informed commentaries by film historians and a good documentary on Keaton's work in the thirties, and, most impressively, a facsimile of an original script, including the hand-written notes of the director.Highly recommended for anyone who loves old-school slapstick comedy, not only for Keaton fanatics.",4,much better than expected,1178668800,"05 9, 2007",2007,2366,"['Columbia', 'shorts', 'are', 'much', 'maligned', 'yet', 'set', 'unfair', 'most', 'part', '10', 'two-reelers', 'Buster', 'did', 'Columbia', 'least', 'seven', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'Sure', 'do', 'not', 'reach', 'heights', 'silent', 'classics', 'were', 'made', 'very', 'cheap', 'are', 'very', 'energetic', 'fast-moving', 'even', 'forties', 'gruelling', 'battle', 'alcohol', 'depression', 'Buster', 'still', 'out', 'very', 'impressive', 'physical', 'skills', 'Plots', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'slapstick', 'everywhere', 'influence', 'director/producer', 'Jules', 'White', 'who', 'was', 'man', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'very', 'noticeable', 'still', 'Buster', 'be', 'Buster', 'most', 'cases', 'not', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'allowing', 'rework', 'older', 'routines', 'creative', 'way', 'Buster', 'worst', 'when', 'handling', 'dialogue', 'never', 'comfortable', 'voice', 'scratchy', 'monotonous', 'tendency', 'bob', 'head', 'word', 'when', 'silent', 'magic', 'still', 'there.Some', 'shorts', 'use', 'Harold', 'Lloyd-style', 'gags', 'others', 'have', 'scenes', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'several', 'times', 'Buster', 'plot', 'earlier', 'talkie', 'films', 'was', 'Most', 'successfully', 'so', 'delightful', 'Pest', 'West', 'far', 'shorter', 'remake', 'British', 'film', 'Invader', 'probably', 'only', 'film', 'here', 'equals', 'Buster', 'silent', 'material', 'inventiveness', 'surreal', 'humor', 'much', 'fun', 'be', 'had', 'almost', 'film', 'collection.Buster', 'appealing', 'leading', 'lady', 'Dorothy', 'Appleby', 'more', 'special', 'one', 'Elsie', 'Ames', 'who', 'so', 'raucous', 'Betty', 'Hutton', 'seem', 'demure', 'other', 'hand', 'very', 'impressive', 'physical', 'skills', 'only', 'female', 'performer', 'who', 'could', 'almost', 'match', 'Buster', 'acrobatic', 'front', 'recurring', 'player', 'Monty', 'Collins', 'who', 'broad', 'comedian', 'far', 'less', 'talent', 'Keaton', 'shorts', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'quite', 'well', 'especially', 'Mooching', 'Georgia', 'Civil', 'War', 'farce', '.The', 'extras', 'are', 'nice', 'informed', 'commentaries', 'film', 'historians', 'good', 'documentary', 'Keaton', 'work', 'thirties', 'most', 'impressively', 'facsimile', 'original', 'script', 'including', 'hand-written', 'notes', 'director.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'old-school', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'not', 'only', 'Keaton', 'fanatics']",N/A
