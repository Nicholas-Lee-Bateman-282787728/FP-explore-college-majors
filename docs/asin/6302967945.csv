The name did sound familiar, so, since I was looking for something new, I decided to order this video. This has to be one of the toughest step aerobic videos I've done in a long time, aside from anything Kari Anderson has done. The warmup and cool down are a bit wimpy, especially for the intense workout you get, but her instruction and cueing is actually pretty good. All in all, a good overall workout for intermediate to advanced steppers.",4,Great step workout,1037836800,"11 21, 2002",2002,552,"['first', 'introduction', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'was', 'seeing', 'Kathy', 'Smith', 'quot', 'Kickboxing', 'Workout', 'quot', 'name', 'did', 'sound', 'familiar', 'so', 'was', 'looking', 'something', 'new', 'decided', 'order', 'video', 'be', 'one', 'toughest', 'step', 'aerobic', 'videos', ""'ve"", 'done', 'long', 'time', 'aside', 'anything', 'Kari', 'Anderson', 'done', 'warmup', 'cool', 'down', 'are', 'bit', 'wimpy', 'especially', 'intense', 'workout', 'get', 'instruction', 'cueing', 'actually', 'pretty', 'good', 'good', 'overall', 'workout', 'intermediate', 'advanced', 'steppers']",N/A

Keli Robert's six packs inspire you and she's an energetic woman, which pumps you up.There is one section of the video which requires you to move the opposite leg than in the video in order to do it properly and it may be confusing for beginners/ 2 left-foots. I was surprised that Keli Roberts wouldn't point that out in the video.Ab section is a killer.",5,Great workout- a little confusing leg moves,1091059200,"07 29, 2004",2004,393,"['Great', 'workout', 'interesting', 'moves', 'Keli', 'Robert', 'six', 'packs', 'inspire', 'energetic', 'woman', 'pumps', 'one', 'section', 'video', 'move', 'opposite', 'leg', 'video', 'order', 'do', 'properly', 'may', 'be', 'confusing', 'beginners/', '2', 'left-foots', 'was', 'surprised', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'would', ""n't"", 'point', 'out', 'video.Ab', 'section', 'killer']",N/A

347634,A24ZFFRQ4MG3XL,6302967945,Little Miss Cutey,"[2, 3]","Ok, so if you do this workout so often that your body gets  used to it and it doesn't challenge you anymore, fine.  That will happen to all great workouts.  But, this workout is  fantastic and geared to Intermediate steppers and maybe Advanced steppers too, if your platform is on high.  It is interesting and the choreography is great and she DOES give good instruction.  If she doesn't say LEFT or RIGHT foot (Like one reviewer said), then it's not the end of the world because you just mirror everything they do.  It gets you huffing and puffing and suddenly when you're done, you can pat yourself on the back for getting through a great workout and doing good work.  The other aspect of the tape I loved was that her co-exercisers, don't yell out and ruin  it all.  They keep quiet and smile and seem to enjoy it as much as I know you will.  Stick to it for minimum of three times a week and about five to six times a week and the WEIGHT WILL MELT OFF YOU!!!!",5,Pay No Attention to Bad Reviews - This Workout is Incredible,993772800,"06 29, 2001",2001,963,"['Ok', 'so', 'do', 'workout', 'so', 'often', 'body', 'used', ""n't"", 'challenge', 'anymore', 'fine', 'will', 'happen', 'great', 'workouts', 'workout', 'fantastic', 'geared', 'Intermediate', 'steppers', 'maybe', 'Advanced', 'steppers', 'too', 'platform', 'high', 'interesting', 'choreography', 'great', 'DOES', 'give', 'good', 'instruction', ""n't"", 'say', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT', 'foot', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'then', 'not', 'end', 'world', 'just', 'mirror', 'everything', 'do', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'suddenly', 'when', ""'re"", 'done', 'can', 'pat', 'back', 'getting', 'great', 'workout', 'doing', 'good', 'work', 'other', 'aspect', 'tape', 'loved', 'was', 'co-exercisers', 'do', ""n't"", 'yell', 'out', 'ruin', 'keep', 'quiet', 'smile', 'seem', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'know', 'will', 'Stick', 'minimum', 'three', 'times', 'week', 'about', 'five', 'six', 'times', 'week', 'WEIGHT', 'WILL', 'MELT', 'OFF', 'YOU']",N/A

The warm up is long enough to get you really warmed  up, the cardio portion gets more challenging as you progress and the abs  and cool down sections are excellent.

347636,AD39QGHGWAOPQ,6302967945,"mwreview ""mwreview""","[6, 6]","I first learned about aerobics instructor Keli Roberts when I found the workout video Cherfitness: A New Attitude.  I enjoyed this video so much that I purchased this one.  I think Roberts' cueing is even better on this video (it's not as clean on A New Attitude). Her English accent is also not as intrusive as it is on the Cher video.  It is not as fun as A New Attitude with Cher's comments and the popular rock music, but it is a good, solid workout.  The first part is pretty basic and would be OK for the beginner.  The second part of the workout (after Roberts switches the bench to a vertical position) is more intermediate/advanced because it requires a lot more endurance with lunges, etc.  The workout includes a section of abdominal work which is always a plus.  I do not feel that the abdominal exercise are as effective as the ones on the Cher video.  The final cool down (there is also a cool down stretch which is very effective) is almost a meditation during which Roberts describes you as floating on a fluffy cloud.  This part I found a bit much and I usually skip it.  The entire workout (with meditative cool down) is 53 minutes.  It is not as good as the Cher video but would still make a good addition to any aerobics library. The Cher workout is an hour and twenty minutes long, so it may not be as practical most days. I had to drop another star because of the silly cool down.",3,"Good Workout, but Skip the Final Cool Down",1046217600,"02 26, 2003",2003,1402,"['first', 'learned', 'aerobics', 'instructor', 'Keli', 'Roberts', 'when', 'found', 'workout', 'video', 'Cherfitness', 'New', 'Attitude', 'enjoyed', 'video', 'so', 'much', 'purchased', 'one', 'think', 'Roberts', 'cueing', 'even', 'better', 'video', 'not', 'clean', 'A', 'New', 'Attitude', 'English', 'accent', 'also', 'not', 'as', 'intrusive', 'Cher', 'video', 'not', 'as', 'fun', 'A', 'New', 'Attitude', 'Cher', 'comments', 'popular', 'rock', 'music', 'good', 'solid', 'workout', 'first', 'part', 'pretty', 'basic', 'would', 'be', 'OK', 'beginner', 'second', 'part', 'workout', 'Roberts', 'bench', 'vertical', 'position', 'more', 'intermediate/advanced', 'lot', 'more', 'endurance', 'lunges', 'etc', 'workout', 'section', 'abdominal', 'work', 'always', 'plus', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'abdominal', 'exercise', 'are', 'as', 'effective', 'ones', 'Cher', 'video', 'final', 'cool', 'down', 'also', 'cool', 'down', 'stretch', 'very', 'effective', 'almost', 'meditation', 'Roberts', 'floating', 'fluffy', 'cloud', 'part', 'found', 'bit', 'much', 'usually', 'skip', 'entire', 'workout', 'meditative', 'cool', 'down', '53', 'minutes', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Cher', 'video', 'would', 'still', 'make', 'good', 'addition', 'aerobics', 'library', 'Cher', 'workout', 'hour', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'long', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'practical', 'most', 'days', 'had', 'drop', 'star', 'silly', 'cool', 'down']",N/A
347637,A3DKB9QZUJYBE3,6302967945,"Trixie ""cupcakejones""","[0, 0]","I see many people mention this tape isn't appropriate for beginners. I do tend to agree because the choreography is a bit complex in the later segments and from a cardio perspective, it's fairly challenging. However, there is no reason you can't work up to doing all three segments and you'll end up getting much more use out of it than your beginner tapes once you get the hang of it--nothing on this tape is impossibly hard for someone who regularly works out. I had this years ago on VHS and I loved it. It was one of the most original step tapes I had and once I got a handle on the more unique moves, I had a blast doing it. I'm so bummed out this isn't available on DVD (although Keli is still making fitness DVD's.) Bonus: there is a great, original and short ab workout at the end and a brief relaxation segment where Keli talks you through a short meditative sequence in her lovely Aussie accent.",4,"Great, innovative step workout",1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,905,"['see', 'many', 'people', 'mention', 'tape', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'beginners', 'do', 'tend', 'agree', 'choreography', 'bit', 'complex', 'later', 'segments', 'cardio', 'perspective', 'fairly', 'challenging', 'However', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'work', 'up', 'doing', 'three', 'segments', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'use', 'beginner', 'tapes', 'once', 'get', 'hang', 'nothing', 'tape', 'impossibly', 'hard', 'someone', 'who', 'regularly', 'out', 'had', 'years', 'ago', 'VHS', 'loved', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'step', 'tapes', 'had', 'once', 'got', 'handle', 'more', 'unique', 'moves', 'had', 'blast', 'doing', ""'m"", 'so', 'bummed', 'out', ""n't"", 'available', 'DVD', 'Keli', 'still', 'making', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'great', 'original', 'short', 'ab', 'workout', 'end', 'brief', 'relaxation', 'segment', 'where', 'Keli', 'talks', 'short', 'meditative', 'sequence', 'lovely', 'Aussie', 'accent']",N/A
