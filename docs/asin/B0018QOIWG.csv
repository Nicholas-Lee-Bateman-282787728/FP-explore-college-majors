1160792,A12P84EGJD4JVX,B0018QOIWG,Edith Biggar,"[1, 1]","This is a helpful video for anybody impacted with the terrible disease of Depression. Mental Health issues are one of my ""special interest topics"". As I can afford, I get as many DVDs on Mental Health issues, especially Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias. I am caregiver of one afflicted with what her doctor has diagnosed ""multi-infarct dementia"". It ""looks"" like Alzheimer's Disease, but nothing can be prescribed for this person. I am also afflicted with Dysthymia. This video addresses several different disorders ""under the umbrella"" of Depression - major Depression, BiPolar Disease, Dysthymia, and some of the diagnostic criterion for each. It is not a ""dry"" presentation of facts. The viewer is introduced to several different people in this video, each afflicted with one or other of the disorders.I think this video would be a good purchase, especially for people like me, a sufferer, a caregiver, professionals caring for people with this group of disorders. It might be a little too ""technical"" for a person who doesn't have some medical knowledge. But, I am glad I purchased it and have viewed it three times, so far. I intend to view it additional times in the future as well. There is nothing I wish I had known prior to purchasing this video. It is worth every penny I paid for it.",5,A helpful video on Depression,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",2012,1304,"['helpful', 'video', 'anybody', 'impacted', 'terrible', 'disease', 'Depression', 'Mental', 'Health', 'issues', 'are', 'one', 'special', 'interest', 'topics', 'can', 'afford', 'get', 'many', 'DVDs', 'Mental', 'Health', 'issues', 'especially', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'related', 'Dementias', 'am', 'caregiver', 'one', 'afflicted', 'what', 'doctor', 'diagnosed', 'multi-infarct', 'dementia', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'prescribed', 'person', 'am', 'also', 'afflicted', 'Dysthymia', 'video', 'several', 'different', 'disorders', 'umbrella', 'Depression', 'major', 'Depression', 'BiPolar', 'Disease', 'Dysthymia', 'diagnostic', 'criterion', 'not', 'dry', 'presentation', 'facts', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'several', 'different', 'people', 'video', 'afflicted', 'one', 'other', 'disorders.I', 'think', 'video', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'purchase', 'especially', 'people', 'sufferer', 'caregiver', 'professionals', 'caring', 'people', 'group', 'disorders', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'technical', 'person', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'am', 'glad', 'purchased', 'have', 'viewed', 'three', 'times', 'so', 'far', 'intend', 'view', 'additional', 'times', 'future', 'well', 'nothing', 'wish', 'had', 'known', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'video', 'worth', 'penny', 'paid']",Depression: Out of the Shadows

1160794,A3KWSNJD5OOAIF,B0018QOIWG,"JesusIsLordDLWC ""DLWC""","[0, 0]","This documentary is an excellent lengthy film on severe depression. It covers both unipolar and bi-polar episodes of what severedepression is and what it is not. There are interviews with therapists and patients whom have been institutionized and have receivedmedication therapy; shock therapy; and interpersonal therapy (one-on-one). This documentary also covers suicidal patients. Thankgoodness it is not all about teenagers, but, it gives you a broad range of adults whom have been tramatized by various forms of mental illness. If you are suffering from severe depression than this documentary is for you and your loved ones and well worththe money. This documentary also covers patients whom medication and pyschotherapy has not worked.

1160795,A1HLDB2ARVL1Z0,B0018QOIWG,Linda E. Dewey MD,"[51, 51]","What can I say that others haven't already expressed very eloquently?  The movie reviews the diagnosis of Depression, along with most of the treatments currently available, and most importantly, includes excellent interviews with a wide variety of people from all walks of life, who suffer with this illness.  Because of my own history with this illness, this was an extremely ACCURATE AND COMPASSIONATE documentary.  I feel, in fact, that it should be shown in ""health education"" classes in high schools, just as we have ""sex education"".  Many young people suffer from mental illness, but have no way to identify it, or ""name"" it.  A truly wonderful, informational, documentary.  Highly recommended.  I would recommend this to my patients, and the families of patients, with Major Depressive Disorder.",5,"This movie ""Tells it like it is"", from the point of view of someone with Major Depressive Disorder",1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,802,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'others', 'have', ""n't"", 'already', 'expressed', 'very', 'eloquently', 'movie', 'diagnosis', 'Depression', 'most', 'treatments', 'currently', 'available', 'most', 'importantly', 'excellent', 'interviews', 'wide', 'variety', 'people', 'walks', 'life', 'who', 'suffer', 'illness', 'own', 'history', 'illness', 'was', 'extremely', 'ACCURATE', 'AND', 'COMPASSIONATE', 'documentary', 'feel', 'fact', 'should', 'be', 'shown', 'health', 'education', 'classes', 'high', 'schools', 'just', 'have', 'sex', 'education', 'Many', 'young', 'people', 'suffer', 'mental', 'illness', 'have', 'way', 'identify', 'name', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'informational', 'documentary', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'would', 'recommend', 'patients', 'families', 'patients', 'Major', 'Depressive', 'Disorder']",Depression: Out of the Shadows
