801217,A1DS5AROCQZ4L6,B0001DMVBC,40yo Average American White Guy,"[3, 3]","Like its title, ""House of Sand and Fog"" is dark, brooding and takes it time. Two characters find themselves both totally invested in owning the same house.  A Shakespearean dilemma is created. Both are right; both are wrong. Both have painful pasts that fuel their stubborn determination not to compromise.Each scene follows logically; each scene pulls you in, deeper and deeper, first through an interested sympathy, then an agitated frustration, and finally into a growing sense of impending doom.It all works marvelously, due not just to the excellent story and direction, but also to the A+ caliber acting. Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley both won Oscars for other films, but their performances here are every bit as good as anything else they have done. And Ron Eldard, to me, steals the movie as the troubled cop who is tossed like a lit match into the middle of this explosive situation.What a flick. I personally rank ""House of Sand and Fog"" as my favorite tragic film.

801218,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,B0001DMVBC,"adriana ""alisa""","[2, 2]","House of Sand And Fog undoubtedly makes a huge impact.I walked away from the film feeling so emotionally drained, I could've sworn I'd just survived my own Shakespearean tragedy.And, no question the acting is some of the most(if not the most) explosive,and intense ensemble acting you'll see all year.Jennifer Connelly is a superb dramatic actress who sketches in depth and dimension through her character from the very first line she utters.She is subtle, and never passes over hysterics for true emotion.Ben Kingsley is AMAZING.His performance is brave,and heartbraking,and ultimately explosive.Shoreh Agdashloo (did I spell that right?) also gives a quitely moving performance as Kingsley's wife.And the climax of the film completely tore me into shreds, and left me feeling emotionally drained(which means the movie worked)That's about all the praise I can give to House, and in truth it does deserve a lot of praise, especially for a first time director.There are a couple problems with the film however.First of all,I felt Ron Eldard's character was never well developed enough.Maybe that had something to do with the fact that Eldard was overwhlemed by the powerhouse performances around him, but I just felt like his character, and his performance never really hit home.The biggest problem was the ending.The climax really hit home,(I wept like a baby),but then the film just wouldn't end.It kept stopping at a bunch of dramatic moments that all seemed like they were potential endings; by the time the film was over I was actually glad.It kind of smothered the impact of the climax for me.Another problem was the overused James Horner score.Not only was the score itself not terribly melodic or emotional, it was swept into the last 20 minutes (which were supposed to be the most emotional) at full volume with no relief, which really made my emotions go down.All in all, despite its flaws, I think House Of Sand And Fog is a safe recommendation for film buffs.I warn you its very sad and depressing,but its definately not a film that you'll walk away from feeling nothing.",3,"Intesne,Superbly Acted,but ultimately falls short",1080259200,"03 26, 2004",2004,2082,"['House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'undoubtedly', 'huge', 'impact.I', 'walked', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'so', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'could', ""'ve"", 'sworn', ""'d"", 'just', 'survived', 'own', 'Shakespearean', 'tragedy.And', 'question', 'acting', 'most', 'not', 'most', 'explosive', 'intense', 'ensemble', 'acting', ""'ll"", 'see', 'year.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'superb', 'dramatic', 'actress', 'who', 'depth', 'dimension', 'character', 'very', 'first', 'line', 'utters.She', 'subtle', 'never', 'passes', 'hysterics', 'true', 'emotion.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'AMAZING.His', 'performance', 'brave', 'heartbraking', 'ultimately', 'explosive.Shoreh', 'Agdashloo', 'did', 'spell', 'right', 'also', 'quitely', 'moving', 'performance', 'Kingsley', 'wife.And', 'climax', 'film', 'completely', 'shreds', 'left', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'movie', 'worked', 'praise', 'can', 'give', 'House', 'truth', 'deserve', 'lot', 'praise', 'especially', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'couple', 'problems', 'film', 'however.First', 'felt', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'character', 'was', 'never', 'well', 'developed', 'enough.Maybe', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'fact', 'Eldard', 'was', 'overwhlemed', 'powerhouse', 'just', 'felt', 'character', 'performance', 'never', 'really', 'hit', 'home.The', 'biggest', 'problem', 'was', 'ending.The', 'climax', 'really', 'hit', 'home', 'wept', 'baby', 'then', 'film', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'end.It', 'kept', 'stopping', 'bunch', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'seemed', 'were', 'potential', 'endings', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'was', 'actually', 'glad.It', 'kind', 'smothered', 'impact', 'climax', 'me.Another', 'problem', 'was', 'overused', 'James', 'Horner', 'score.Not', 'only', 'was', 'score', 'not', 'terribly', 'melodic', 'emotional', 'was', 'swept', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'most', 'emotional', 'full', 'volume', 'relief', 'really', 'made', 'emotions', 'go', 'down.All', 'flaws', 'think', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'safe', 'recommendation', 'film', 'buffs.I', 'warn', 'very', 'sad', 'depressing', 'definately', 'not', 'film', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'nothing']",N/A

I didn't think it would be able to sustain my interest. Then the reviews came in, and the public reaction, and the award nominations, and soon I had to see what all the fuss was about.Directed by Vadim Perelman ""House of Sand and Fog"" is an emotional and visual masterpiece. The movie doesn't just create characters, it breathes life into them and makes them seem real. The screenplay by Perelman and Shawn Lawrence Otto based on a novel by Andre Dubus II does something pretty fascinating. To give you a vague idea the movie has Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley fighting over who is the rightful owner of a house. The house was given to Connelly after her father died, but, when back taxes are not paid she is evicted and soon the house is up for auction. It is Kingsley, an Iranian immigrant who buys the house. And so the feud starts. But, the movie is able to present both sides to us. We can see what the house means for both sides. For Connelly it's a rememberance of her past, for Kingsley it means looking forward to the future. Our emotions keep shifting back and forth. We feel sorry for everyone involved and after a while we don't know what to think.The acting in this movie has been getting a lot of attention, and righfully so, but as I watched this movie Roger Deakins' (who usually works with the Coen Brothers) cinematography caught my eye. He is able to get such beautiful shots along with David Stockton.But I suppose it is the acting that will get people into the seats to watch this movie. Connelly after her performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"" keeps up her winning streak. I can't reveal too much about her character other than saying she's a ""lost soul"". She just seems to be on the wrong track. To many it is a disappointment she didn't receive an Oscar nomination. Kingsley on the other hand is kind of the cliche ""tough as nails"" sterotype idea we have of the kind of character he is playing. But it is effective.Vadim Perelman has directed a powerful absorbing masterpiece. The movie seems real. When it was over everyone in the theather was kind of numb. As the credits rolled no one wanted to get up. We all just wanted to sit down and think about what we had seen. How many movies can we say that about? This is one of the best movies of 2003.Bottom-line: Easily one of the most powerful absorbing and interesting working in 2003. Wonderful performance given by this entire cast. Everyone shines.

801222,A1ZOF747O5EB6R,B0001DMVBC,Andrew Desmond,"[7, 7]","""House of Sand and Fog"" is possibly the best film that I have seen in the past 12 months.  I unreservedly recommend it to all.The essence of the film is that Kath (Jennifer Connelly) owns a pleasant house located on the northern Californian coast.  However, there is a mix up with taxes such that she is levied a $500 tax bill she should never have received.  Yet to make matters worse, her personality is such that she rarely, if ever, opens mail and thus inadvertently ignores numerous reminder messages.  Eventually, the house is sold from under her to an Iranian Colonel (Ben Kingsley) who has emigrated to America with his family to avoid retribution from the Ayatollahs.  He buys the house for about a quarter of its true value and then commences proceedings to on sell the house for a tidy profit.  With both parties claiming ownership, a series of events unfolds that seems to spiral ever downward.The film's ending is tragic and reminded me in some ways of Shakespeare's King Lear where trauma is piled upon trauma.  Certainly, do not see this film as an opportunity for light escape.  But do see this film for its enthralling plot and its totally plausible characters.

801223,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0001DMVBC,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","To be honest, I like depressing.  Seriously, I relish in it; I mean I practically bathe myself in depressing.  I don't know why, label me weird all you want, but there is something about the cinematic representation of that whole `all is lost' that just really moves me in ways that most other cinema cannot.  That said; Andre Dubus III's novel `House of Sand and Fog' was one of the most dreadfully depressing, ultimately frustrating novels I have ever read.  This is coming from a guy who likes depressing (frustrating, now that is another story).The film fares better than the novel for me (which also suffered from being far too long and overwrought) but to be honest, it never manages to lift itself high enough to become brilliant.  I believe the potential was there, but I just don't think the film got everything right.For those of you unfamiliar, `House of Sand and Fog' tells the story of Kathy Nicolo, a young and slightly immature woman who lives in a house once belonging to her father.  When she disregards notes regarding a tax she is unfairly charged she winds up being evicted from her home, even though the tax should have never been administered to her.  Before the damage can be reversed her house if put up for auction and purchased by Iranian former military officer Behrani.  Behrani is desperately trying to give his family the stature they once possessed and he sees the purchase of this home and an opportunity to do just that.  His stubbornness, as well as that of Kathy, lead to some very compromising situations, all of which could have been avoided had either of them acted like adults.Like I said, this story is very frustrating.That is my biggest complaint really.  I remember reading the book and getting all sorts of anxious because I could not foresee any sort of redemption in these characters.  I wanted to slap them all and force them to objectively look at their situation.  Watching the movie is almost as difficult for me, because they do the same stupid things; it only fares better because you don't dwell on the situation for weeks on end, it only takes two hours this time.The film does have some very high points as well though.  The acting on almost every front is superb.  Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghgashloo were both Oscar nominated for their performances, and deservedly so.  Kingsley is a force as the confrontational Behrani, but it is Aghdashloo's blessedly restrained portrayal of his wife Nadi that steals the entire film (she should have won the Oscar, hands down).  Jennifer Connelly is also very effective, but she takes a back seat to the commanding strengths of her co-stars.  Ron Eldard is the films weak link, and while he is not entirely to blame (his character repulses me) he doesn't do much to make up for the lack of emotional connection his character possesses.The direction by Vadim Perelman is well done.  It captures the ominous tone of the film.  Like I said, this does fare better than the novel, for it is not as deeply unsettling (although the ending is definitely heartbreaking) so one can actually `take' this one, but know that this is not for the faint of heart.  If emotional distress is something that leaves you with any sort of lasting discomfort then stay away from this film, and please avoid the novel at all cost.Yes, I love a good depressing film, but when depressing mixes heavily with unwarranted frustration I get overworked and overwhelmed.  That said; I cannot deny the fact that this is still a very well constructed film that hits its mark on just about every level.  The character of Lester really ruins a lot for me (I hate individuals that are `that' destructively stupid) but as a whole the film is very good, if not nightmarishly effective.",4,Frustration may very well be my Achilles heal...,1224115200,"10 16, 2008",2008,3741,"['be', 'honest', 'like', 'depressing', 'Seriously', 'relish', 'mean', 'practically', 'bathe', 'depressing', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'label', 'want', 'something', 'cinematic', 'representation', 'whole', 'lost', 'just', 'really', 'ways', 'most', 'other', 'cinema', 'can', 'not', 'said', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'III', 'novel', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'dreadfully', 'depressing', 'ultimately', 'frustrating', 'novels', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'coming', 'guy', 'who', 'depressing', 'frustrating', 'now', 'story', '.The', 'film', 'fares', 'better', 'novel', 'also', 'suffered', 'being', 'far', 'too', 'long', 'overwrought', 'be', 'honest', 'never', 'lift', 'high', 'enough', 'become', 'brilliant', 'believe', 'potential', 'was', 'there', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'got', 'everything', 'right.For', 'unfamiliar', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'story', 'Kathy', 'Nicolo', 'young', 'slightly', 'immature', 'woman', 'who', 'house', 'once', 'belonging', 'father', 'When', 'notes', 'regarding', 'tax', 'unfairly', 'charged', 'up', 'being', 'evicted', 'home', 'even', 'tax', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'administered', 'damage', 'can', 'be', 'reversed', 'house', 'put', 'up', 'auction', 'purchased', 'Iranian', 'former', 'military', 'officer', 'Behrani', 'Behrani', 'desperately', 'trying', 'give', 'family', 'stature', 'once', 'possessed', 'purchase', 'home', 'opportunity', 'do', 'just', 'stubbornness', 'as', 'well', 'Kathy', 'lead', 'very', 'compromising', 'situations', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'avoided', 'had', 'acted', 'adults.Like', 'said', 'story', 'very', 'frustrating.That', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'really', 'remember', 'reading', 'book', 'getting', 'sorts', 'anxious', 'could', 'not', 'foresee', 'sort', 'redemption', 'characters', 'wanted', 'slap', 'force', 'objectively', 'look', 'situation', 'Watching', 'movie', 'almost', 'difficult', 'do', 'same', 'stupid', 'things', 'only', 'better', 'do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'situation', 'weeks', 'end', 'only', 'two', 'hours', 'time.The', 'film', 'have', 'very', 'high', 'points', 'as', 'well', 'acting', 'almost', 'front', 'superb', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Shohreh', 'Aghgashloo', 'were', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performances', 'deservedly', 'so', 'Kingsley', 'force', 'confrontational', 'Behrani', 'Aghdashloo', 'blessedly', 'restrained', 'portrayal', 'wife', 'Nadi', 'entire', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'Oscar', 'down', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'back', 'seat', 'commanding', 'strengths', 'co-stars', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'films', 'weak', 'link', 'not', 'entirely', 'blame', 'character', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'emotional', 'connection', 'character', 'possesses.The', 'direction', 'Vadim', 'Perelman', 'well', 'done', 'ominous', 'tone', 'film', 'said', 'fare', 'better', 'novel', 'not', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'ending', 'definitely', 'heartbreaking', 'one', 'can', 'actually', 'take', 'one', 'know', 'not', 'faint', 'heart', 'emotional', 'distress', 'something', 'sort', 'lasting', 'discomfort', 'then', 'stay', 'away', 'film', 'please', 'avoid', 'novel', 'cost.Yes', 'love', 'good', 'depressing', 'film', 'when', 'depressing', 'mixes', 'heavily', 'unwarranted', 'frustration', 'get', 'overworked', 'overwhelmed', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'fact', 'still', 'very', 'well', 'constructed', 'film', 'mark', 'just', 'level', 'character', 'Lester', 'really', 'lot', 'hate', 'individuals', 'are', 'destructively', 'stupid', 'whole', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'nightmarishly', 'effective']",N/A

I had just seen Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast' so the constrast was stunning.  And Connelly is better here - forced to plumb greater depths - than she was in her Oscar-winning turn in ""A Beautiful Mind.""  (Why no Oscar nomination here if Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo got them?  Seems an obvious oversight.)The real revelations here are co-star Aghdashloo and director Vadim Perelman.  Aghdashloo was justly rewarded with an Independent Spirit award and that Oscar nod.  Great to see the Academy go a little wider afield in their recognition.With Aghdashloo and Whale Rider's Keisha Castle-Hughes, it's obvious there's a sea change coming.  Aghdashloo deserves that nomination.  She's the stitching that pulls together each of the film's different threads.  Plus, holding your own in scene after scene with Sir Ben Kingsley is quite a feat.Perelman's personal story is inspiring.  What a trip for this Ukrainian imigrant who was known up until this point as a director of commercials.  He formed a bond with writer Andre Dubus III because he saw that ""House"" was a bleak, uncompromising story - he made a promise to Dubus not to mess with that tone...no contrived, uplifting ending here.  Far from it.  This is one of the more savage, stunning ends to a film you'll ever see.Perelman's next project is 'The Talisman' (based on a Stephen King story), with Executive Producer Steven Spielberg (due out in 2005).

And certain elements of it are very good: cinematography (although northern California doesn't really represent a challenge to film well--it's gorgeous), acting (Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley both perform well, as does the actress who plays his wife).But it's hard for me to watch a movie without happiness, and this is one of those.  You can only be hit so many times before you stop coming back for more and &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; keeps hitting you with problems until you just end up asking, exasperated, whether the characters have gone through enough yet.There are other problems:-The movie is over-long by at least a half-hour.-Jennifer Connelly, who supposedly hasn't showered in days, looks dewy and beautiful.-This woman who has had a hard time giving up on her marriage after eight months, gives up on a guy after a few hours?-And all of this starts because she hasn't opened her mail, which doesn't make sense.  Because wouldn't other bill collectors have come running when she didn't pay month after month?  She wouldn't have electricity.  Or a phone.-It's hard to get an emotional connection with characters that keep doing hurtful, selfish things.-The violence at the end seemed completely unnecessary, just there to be horrifying.-The scenery, dense with fog, that provides the segues, are lovely but overdone.  Okay, I get that this is a foggy, unclear situation.This could have been a great movie.  The talent was there, both in acting and cinematography (direction was mediocre).  However, the story is just lethal.  Slow, with no happiness or humor.  Characters that give you no reason to feel a connection with them.

If directed by Vadim Perelman, something amazing no doubt, but one does not expect the magnitude of this film.  Despite a wholly depressing story, this film works wonders in our minds and hearts and will further engrave Kingsley and Connelly in the pantheon of the best actors and actresses in Hollywood.(Don't worry, this isn't a spoiler review, what I am relaying is on the cover of the box and occurs in the first few minutes.)Kingsley portrays an Irani who fled from his home after the Ayatollah came to power.  He is constantly striving to reclaim the lost glory of his military career and his beautiful home on the Caspian Sea.  It brought a view hindered by trees until one day he has them cut down.  Could that possibly clue us in to his mind and his possible future?Connelly is also now a refugee, but in her own country and town.  Her husband gone, she discovers that she owes a paltry sum in business taxes and due to her non-payment, the government takes and sells her house.  Destitute and alone, she reverts into some child-like state, needing the affections and support of a cop in a mid-life crisis.  What will she need to do in order to get her house back?I will stop with the plot description there, and add that any semblance of what this movie is about can be disgarded right away.  There is no easy way to pin down this film, as it is a beautifully shot cinematic triumph about home, family, and the soul.  The message is nothing short of heart-breaking, yet an important lesson to be learned by those who have bought into our culture of buying the bigger toys.  SUVs, sneakers with lights, fancy designer clothes, medically altered bodies, what do they all add up to in the end?  What drives us in our pursuit to be the neighbor with the biggest SUV on our block?  Is the American dream simply that, a pipe dream?More importantly, what are the consequences of our actions?  What will the search for perfection bring?  In the end, do our possessions even matter?  It is a multi-layered cinematic gem that needs to be seen by those in this generation of showing off and flashiness.  This is the perfect film for this tidal wave of false idols and brand names.  One cannot miss the poignant message of this movie.  Film buffs should already own it, lovers of drama and superior acting should as well, and everyone else should screen it at least once for the important lessons it teaches us.",5,Simply superb,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",2004,2478,"['What', 'would', 'one', 'expect', 'Oscar-winning', 'performers', 'one', 'film', 'directed', 'Vadim', 'Perelman', 'something', 'amazing', 'doubt', 'one', 'not', 'expect', 'magnitude', 'film', 'wholly', 'depressing', 'story', 'film', 'wonders', 'minds', 'hearts', 'will', 'further', 'engrave', 'Kingsley', 'Connelly', 'pantheon', 'best', 'actors', 'actresses', 'Hollywood', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""n't"", 'spoiler', 'review', 'what', 'am', 'relaying', 'cover', 'box', 'first', 'few', 'minutes', 'Kingsley', 'Irani', 'who', 'fled', 'home', 'Ayatollah', 'came', 'power', 'constantly', 'striving', 'reclaim', 'lost', 'glory', 'military', 'career', 'beautiful', 'home', 'Caspian', 'Sea', 'brought', 'view', 'hindered', 'trees', 'one', 'day', 'cut', 'down', 'Could', 'possibly', 'clue', 'mind', 'possible', 'future', 'Connelly', 'also', 'now', 'refugee', 'own', 'country', 'town', 'husband', 'gone', 'paltry', 'sum', 'business', 'taxes', 'due', 'non-payment', 'government', 'house', 'Destitute', 'alone', 'child-like', 'state', 'needing', 'affections', 'support', 'cop', 'mid-life', 'crisis', 'What', 'will', 'need', 'do', 'order', 'get', 'house', 'back', 'will', 'stop', 'plot', 'description', 'there', 'add', 'semblance', 'what', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'disgarded', 'right', 'away', 'easy', 'way', 'pin', 'down', 'film', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'cinematic', 'triumph', 'home', 'family', 'soul', 'message', 'nothing', 'short', 'heart-breaking', 'important', 'lesson', 'be', 'learned', 'who', 'have', 'bought', 'culture', 'buying', 'bigger', 'toys', 'SUVs', 'sneakers', 'lights', 'fancy', 'designer', 'clothes', 'medically', 'altered', 'bodies', 'what', 'do', 'add', 'up', 'end', 'What', 'pursuit', 'be', 'neighbor', 'biggest', 'SUV', 'block', 'American', 'dream', 'simply', 'pipe', 'dream', 'More', 'importantly', 'what', 'are', 'consequences', 'actions', 'What', 'will', 'search', 'perfection', 'bring', 'end', 'do', 'possessions', 'even', 'matter', 'multi-layered', 'cinematic', 'gem', 'be', 'seen', 'generation', 'showing', 'off', 'flashiness', 'perfect', 'film', 'tidal', 'wave', 'false', 'idols', 'brand', 'names', 'One', 'can', 'not', 'miss', 'poignant', 'message', 'movie', 'Film', 'buffs', 'should', 'already', 'own', 'lovers', 'drama', 'superior', 'acting', 'should', 'as', 'well', 'everyone', 'else', 'should', 'screen', 'least', 'once', 'important', 'lessons']",N/A

Jennifer Connelly (who made a great impression recently with ""A Beautiful Mind"" and to a lesser extent ""Requiem for a Dream"") gave a good performance as well for a girl who made terrible mistakes and tries to cover them by making worst mistakes. But the biggest impression I got was from Shoreh Aghdashloo (who played Nadi), I mean her performance was totally absorbing in how much of a reaction I felt for her. Her facial expressions carried a lot of weight and her internal pain seemed real (she should have won the Best Supporting Oscar).

I recently saw this film and many audience members gasped and were stunned by several emotionally charged pivotal scenes. House of Sand and Fog is full of suspenseful steam. Stunning performances by Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly and supporting cast are phenomenal. This is a highly charged film with enough seething psychological and emotional action ! Cinematography of panoramic proportions and filming techniques of the beautiful California coast and sky is simply breath taking but naturally overshadowed and marred by the devastatingly serious nature of the film.In sum,a young California woman is incorrectly evicted from her home due to business property taxes processed which she did not owe. Failure on her part to open up the mail (notices/warnings) from the property county assessor's office lead to Connelly's character pursuing legal action but to no avail. House is auctioned and a Middle Eastern retired military officer (Ben Kingsley) and family purchase home for a 1/4 of what it is worth to live out the American dream.The house may be their permanent residency or it may become a ""transitional"" home. Soon, there is a tumultuous tug of war between evicted home owner and new occupants the likes that make the battle between the Hatfields and McCoys seem like a family reunion ! Events,  tempers, emotions flare to astronomical and disastrous horrific proportions pushing all parties concerned to the edge of madness and the point of no return. Just when there seems to be the least bit of glimmer of hope for compromise, well, you get the picture. The tumultuous battle begins to take its toll on both parties involved and the people around them...Critics are right; there are no villains, heroes or heroines ...Just human beings trying to make sense of the madness that certain events life may throw at them while also trying to survive unscathed. It also raises a very powerful question ; How far is anyone willing to go to hang onto or protect what they believe or know is rightfully theirs (not just in the sense of owning a home but on anything in one's life, material or otherwise) ? Viewer sympathy will be split for both sides.I have never read the book from which the film is adapted from, so I cannot critique as to how faithful the film is to the novel. Is this Oscar material (acting, best picture) ? Absolutley, no question about that.

Unfortunately that gap is shown for what it is: wider than ever.The character of Kathy is portrayed brilliantly by Jennifer Connelly as an emotionally unstable young woman caught up in the turmoil of losing both her husband and her family's home within eight months of each other.  Her character is pinned against Ben Kingsley's Colonel Behrani when Behrani buys Kathy's auctioned house in order to return his own family to a sense of stability.  The catalyst for the two characters' conflict with each other is drawn from the supporting character of Officer Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), a representation of the ignorance and lack of empathy some feel towards people whose lives have led them to seek better ones in the United States. While Behrani's main motive is to protect his family and give it a sense of security, Lester puts his own selfish pleasures before the wellbeing of his own family. Behrani and Lester are complete opposites, Behrani clearly the nobler.  The film shows that there are greater sacrifices in this world than those materialistic in nature.  This type of film truly will tug at your heart and bring tears, yet will give a sense of appreciation for the human life.On a side note, at times I found it difficult to concentrate on this movie because I was distracted by Ron Eldard.

Connelly, though, is only a part of this movies powerful impact. The crux of this movie is the reason I hate award programs, particularly The Oscars. How they gave the supporting actress award to Renee Zellweger this year over Shohreh Aghdashloo, who plays Mrs. Behrani, Ben Kingsley's wife in this film, is ridiculous, and an indictment on The Oscars. Aghdashloo and Kingsley are part of an enormously effective cast, guided by a young, gifted director-Vadim Perelman- with an eye for detail, never wasting an inch of film and framing. What he gets from the actors, scenery, lighting, etc., is like from that of well seasoned directors. And the well seasoned Connelly and Kingsley, along with surrounding cast members, pull your heart and emotions in several directions, none of them incorrect, all sympathetic. The hurt, despair, tension and anger are palpable, all glued together by all around excellent contributions from all who put this movie together: producers, editors, cinematographers, This movie makes wonderful use of lighting, color and music to create an ever flowing rhythm throughout the movie. Everything about this movie looks fabulous on the finished product. It's a real sleeper, with only $15 million in box receipts to its credit. But that doesn't take away from the appeal of of this outstanding story about a bureaucratic mess up that affects the lives of several dramatically. There are some very gripping scenes in this movie, and all with a purpose. This movie is loaded with a variety of emotions, including especially presumptions and prejudice and how both can lead to tragic consequences.

The fight in the film concerns a seaside house and what it represents to those who claim ownership over it.The movie establishes a conflict between its two main characters where neither side outweighs the other, and neither side is entirely wrong. Anti-American and racial sentiments fuel the conflict, and the film acknowledges that - but this isn't just a film about racism.It's about characters whose very natures we come to understand. It, through its visuals and through the uniformly terrific ensemble of actors, also establishes a group of strong core characters, people that you empathize with so much that you cannot choose sides regarding the fight over the house.But, because both sides are desperate and at an impasse, the entire film spirals, like a thriller, toward its tragic, nearly inevitable conclusion. (Certainly, in real life, things might not have turned out as bad as things did for these characters at the end, some might say. But the characters in HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG remain true to their natures, true to their flaws, so it ends the way that it does and feels right.)Jennifer Connelly is terrific in this film. Ron Eldard, playing a character central to the dark turn the film takes, is impressive, making his character so despicable that you hate him, knowing the conclusions he'll jump to before he does. (The last film that generated this sort of response from me was A SIMPLE PLAN, where you could feel that the characters were going to screw up - yet you couldn't help but watch them do it.)Ben Kingsley, who is British and yet is able to transform himself completely in every role, is absolutely amazing as Behrani. The layers of innate goodness, personal pride, potential for violence and paternal instinct necessary to make the character work are all on display here. Kingsley's work is always good, and HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG ranks among the best work he's ever done. The actors playing his wife and son in the film match Kingsley's brilliance in nearly every scene.I'm amazed Vadim Perelman has never made a film before.

If you want to know what I thought about the book, I've written a review here at Amazon.  In a nutshell, I thought the book was absolutely dreadful and nearly unredeemable.  It made me feel bad---not bad for the people or for what happens, but just bad to be exposed to such unlikable characters and an improbable plot---in short, I was depressed by bad art.The movie, in contrast, made me feel not bad but rather sad---sad for the characters themselves, because the screenwriter and actors do a much better job at creating sympathetic characters than does the book's author.  The colonel is a bit less of a monster at the end of the movie---Kathy seems to come more fully to her senses.  Lester's actions don't make any more sense in the movie than in the book, but it's easier in the film to accept that they're impulsive, rash actions being carried out by a desperate man; the book, on the other hand, wants to justify Lester's actions with heaps of back story, none of which helps in the least.The actors do a fine job.  Ben Kingsley's performance is a bit overrated, but even at that it's great.  Ditto Shoreh Aghdashloo--I only wish she had had a bigger role.

I had to keep stopping it about every five minutes just to cool off and yell at the TV set!I must say the filmmakers did a superb job with the aspects of Iranian culture that found their way into the film:  very convicing.  All the actors who speak Farsi are clearly Iranian, and even the furniture in the house is bona fide Isfahan.  The only off-note is Kingsley's frequently horrendous pronunciation, which, given the amount of time he reportedly devotes to developing his roles, is something he should be faulted with.One thing that kind of annoyed me about the movie was the realization, about midway through, that the tax angle of it didn't make any sense.If the woman owed $500 in taxes on a $100,000+ home and the government really did seize it in order to pay the bill, the woman would have then been given about $99,500 in change, meaning that she wouldn't have had to sleep in her car and could have hired a proper lawyer.  When this dawned on me, the rest of the movie lost a lot of its punch.Lastly, I don't think the fog motif worked very well:  it was heavy-handed and annoying.",5,That's what you get for buying auctioned-off property!,1102723200,"12 11, 2004",2004,1517,"['Lord', 'fine', 'movie', 'exquisitely', 'directed', 'peerlessly', 'acted', 'nightmarish', 'script', 'fearlessly', 'characters', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'extraordinarily', 'difficult-to-write', 'scenes', 'not', 'cop', 'out.Sadly', 'hated', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'be', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'excoriated', 'whole', 'thing', 'watching', 'train', 'wreck', 'people', 'messing', 'up', 'lives', 'especially', 'cop', 'sheesh', 'had', 'keep', 'stopping', 'five', 'minutes', 'just', 'cool', 'off', 'yell', 'TV', 'set', 'must', 'say', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'aspects', 'Iranian', 'culture', 'found', 'way', 'film', 'very', 'convicing', 'actors', 'who', 'speak', 'Farsi', 'are', 'clearly', 'Iranian', 'even', 'furniture', 'house', 'bona', 'fide', 'Isfahan', 'only', 'off-note', 'Kingsley', 'frequently', 'horrendous', 'pronunciation', 'given', 'amount', 'time', 'reportedly', 'developing', 'roles', 'something', 'should', 'be', 'faulted', 'with.One', 'thing', 'kind', 'annoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'realization', 'midway', 'tax', 'angle', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense.If', 'woman', 'owed', '500', 'taxes', '100,000+', 'home', 'government', 'really', 'did', 'seize', 'order', 'pay', 'bill', 'woman', 'would', 'have', 'then', 'been', 'given', '99,500', 'change', 'meaning', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'had', 'sleep', 'car', 'could', 'have', 'hired', 'proper', 'lawyer', 'When', 'dawned', 'rest', 'movie', 'lost', 'lot', 'punch.Lastly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'fog', 'motif', 'worked', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'heavy-handed', 'annoying']",N/A

801250,A1EHZ0P4MAV9L5,B0001DMVBC,C. F Higgins,"[4, 7]","House of Sand and Fog is not an uplifting movie -it is a tragedy. And true to all tragedy, the flaws in each character ultmately bring about their doom. But in addition to this, the film explores what the concept of &quot;home&quot; means; as a physical location, and an emotional effigy.Jennifer Connelly plays a self-absorbed, depressed woman, who has a history of unstable relationships, especially with men. She inherits a beach house from her father, only to lose it because of back taxes. Connelly never looks inside herself to discover the roots of her unhappiness -it is always someone else's fault. She externalizes her shortcomings, and stubbornly refuses to change. The lost beach house becomes an obsession to her, a symbol of everything the world has taken from her, everything she resolves to recover, using whatever means necessary, including manipulating a crooked cop into threatening the new tenants. She is lost, without a home, and not even content to be in her own skin. She is detatched, a &quot;foreigner&quot; so to speak, in her own land.Contrast this with Ben Kingsley's character, an Iranian immigrant who purchases the house on auction. He was wealthy and powerful in Iran -a prominant general in the Shah's military. Now he struggles to raise money by working multiple jobs, and constructing the pretense of wealth, in order to impress his Iranian friends. But more importantly, he doesn't want to lose his wife's admiration and esteem. The house for him, is the way to recover a lost life, the one he had to leave behind in Iran.Kingsley's character is a foreigner out of circumstance. Connelly is a foreigner out of choice. In a moving scene near the end of the film, the former general rescues Connely after she botches a suicide attempt, and just when the viewer thinks there may be a reconcilliation, or a happy ending, things deteriorate even more.And the house is just a modest bungalow, in need of some repair.The only thing I would change in this movie, is the ending. I won't spoil it for you, but there is a scene where Connelly's character stands on the pier behind the house, as waves come crashing against it. She spins around in confused pirouettes, looking out into the ocean. It is in this moment she realizes there is no place for her, no &quot;home,&quot; because she has alienated herself from humanity, and brought catastrophe down on those who tried to help to her. The film should have ended right here, but it continues on, and thus loses some intensity.Perhaps the author tried to do a little too much with &quot;House of Sand and Fog,&quot; but a brilliant failure is always better than a mundane success.",5,Astonishing Film,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",2004,2660,"['House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'not', 'uplifting', 'movie', '-it', 'tragedy', 'true', 'tragedy', 'flaws', 'character', 'ultmately', 'bring', 'doom', 'addition', 'film', 'what', 'concept', 'quot', 'home', 'quot', 'physical', 'location', 'emotional', 'effigy.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'self-absorbed', 'depressed', 'woman', 'who', 'history', 'unstable', 'relationships', 'especially', 'men', 'beach', 'house', 'father', 'only', 'lose', 'back', 'taxes', 'Connelly', 'never', 'inside', 'discover', 'roots', 'unhappiness', '-it', 'always', 'someone', 'else', 'fault', 'shortcomings', 'stubbornly', 'change', 'lost', 'beach', 'house', 'obsession', 'symbol', 'everything', 'world', 'taken', 'everything', 'recover', 'using', 'means', 'necessary', 'including', 'manipulating', 'crooked', 'cop', 'threatening', 'new', 'tenants', 'lost', 'home', 'not', 'even', 'content', 'be', 'own', 'skin', 'detatched', 'quot', 'foreigner', 'quot', 'so', 'speak', 'own', 'land.Contrast', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'Iranian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'purchases', 'house', 'auction', 'was', 'wealthy', 'powerful', 'Iran', '-a', 'prominant', 'general', 'Shah', 'military', 'Now', 'raise', 'money', 'working', 'multiple', 'jobs', 'constructing', 'pretense', 'wealth', 'order', 'impress', 'Iranian', 'friends', 'more', 'importantly', ""n't"", 'want', 'lose', 'wife', 'admiration', 'esteem', 'house', 'way', 'recover', 'lost', 'life', 'one', 'had', 'leave', 'behind', 'Iran.Kingsley', 'character', 'foreigner', 'circumstance', 'Connelly', 'foreigner', 'choice', 'moving', 'scene', 'end', 'film', 'former', 'general', 'rescues', 'Connely', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'just', 'when', 'viewer', 'may', 'be', 'reconcilliation', 'happy', 'ending', 'things', 'deteriorate', 'even', 'more.And', 'house', 'just', 'modest', 'bungalow', 'need', 'repair.The', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'change', 'movie', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'scene', 'where', 'Connelly', 'character', 'pier', 'house', 'waves', 'come', 'crashing', 'confused', 'pirouettes', 'looking', 'out', 'ocean', 'moment', 'place', 'quot', 'home', 'quot', 'alienated', 'humanity', 'brought', 'catastrophe', 'down', 'who', 'tried', 'help', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'right', 'here', 'thus', 'intensity.Perhaps', 'author', 'tried', 'do', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'quot', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'quot', 'brilliant', 'failure', 'always', 'better', 'mundane', 'success']",N/A

Ben Kingsley gives a typically masterful performance as an Iranian immigrant whose life goal is to provide the best for his transplanted family.  To that end, he manages to secure a beachfront house, thanks in large part to the fact that Jennifer Connelly's character has lost said house in legal wranglings involving failure to pay taxes.  The story unfolds from there, and ends with devastating consequences for all involved(and I mean ALL). Jennifer Connelly follows up her Oscar for A BEAUTIFUL MIND(she deserved a nod here as well) with another searingly understated performance--I would never have imagined ten years ago that this woman would be one of the best actresses working in film today, but she continues her upward career trajectory.  And Shohreh Aghdashloo scored a much deserved Oscar nod for her equally understated performance as Kingsley's faithful wife.

801255,A36UOQOMFUTPH,B0001DMVBC,Christopher B. Kornman,"[5, 9]","As far as I can tell, this is the basic premise of House of Sand and Fog.  Well, not Hamlet, specifically: it's an analogy.  The point is that the story told in the film feels very Shakespearean.  From the beginning to the end, there are echos of the darkest and most heartwrenching plots penned by the Bard.  What results is a suicidally depressing ending with bodies lying ungracefully all across the set.House of Sand and Fog tries very hard to replicate the emotional dynamic of such plays as Hamlet, Othello, and Macbeth.  However, it doesn't really succeed.  Rather, the film slides deeper and deeper into it's mire of wallowing sadness, until the only cheerful option for the characters is to escape the life that has been made for them, either by themselves or their environments.In some ways, the film seems to argue that the dreadfully sorrowful conditions the characters succumb to are not entirely their own fault, but that they have been driven to such lengths by their contexts--an idea freshmen psychology students will certainly find somewhat intriguing.The acting is even brilliant: Kingsley is a veritable chameleon in his ability to transport the audience into the character's emotions.  Kingsley's persona becomes invisible in order to give us a true sense of his character.Yet with so much depression and sadness, so much tragedy, and so much death, the viewer at some point must wonder, ""what is the point?""  And this is where House of Sand and Fog falls terribly short.  It dives so deep, it forgets why it is even there.  The characters and situations are tragic, but that seems to be it.  There is certainly a sense of sympathy for the suffering, but the characters get so lost in their depression and death that they cease to be human.  And this is where the film looses its appeal.Shakespeare's plays always had an identifiable source in a character of the spiral downwards into tragedy.  But House of Sand and Fog posits the idea that tragedy is to a great extent situational, and this just makes for unwarranted depths of depression that are unrecoverable by the time the film is over.  By the end of the movie, the audience is left with little sense of anything other than oppressive sadness, and there is no why.If you want to be suicidally depressed for no apparent reason, this is the perfect film.

801256,A3SFO2GSP5CVSM,B0001DMVBC,"Cosmoetica ""cosmoeticadotcom""","[0, 4]","Having watched old-time movie serials and pro wrestling for most of my life, as well as soap operas for the last quarter-century I have become something of an expert in the forms of drama and melodrama. The primary difference between the two is that drama is fairly serious and straightforward, and the narrative unfolds over the real reactions of well-developed characters to given situations, whereas melodrama tends to rely on stereotypes, archetypes, and caricatures, and forces climaxes at certain points in a narrative- which is always propelled by the stupidity of the characters. Think of most soap operas- where dumb people foolishly tell deep secrets to those they barely know, and usually someone else is eavesdropping. In true drama- say, Patton, or Ibsen plays, things evolve more naturally out of the events that are portrayed and the protagonists' reactions to them. Of course, sometimes melodrama can rise above its worst tendencies to become drama. In the best of his plays, The Tempest or Hamlet, Shakespeare creates drama out of pure high melodrama, but in his worst- A Midsummer Night's Dream or Titus Andronicus- it's just fifth rate soap opera.With those definitions in mind, welcome to the horridly melodramatic world of House Of Sand And Fog. This piece of tripe is one of those films like In The Bedroom (ironically penned by the father of this film's novel's author) that start out very well- it's well acted, beautifully filmed, and puts forth an intriguing premise- but falls to unrealistic pieces in the second half.... Also, once the flush of the toilet of the film's credibility begins and you know that the stupidest possible action will result the ending is predictable, no matter how out of character the actions are with the characters' earlier portrayals. Another point that sticks in my craw is that this is the third film in which Connelly is seen musing off the end of a pier- in almost exactly replicated shots- first in Dark City, then in Requiem For A Dream, now this. Why, exactly?  Regardless, like In The Bedroom S&F; cheats its audience with its unbelievable and unrealistic end. It's a far worse sort of feeling than viewing a film that was garbage from the first scene, for then you can almost feel a campy glee over the stupidity.With this bad story I can only scratch my head as to why the filmmakers and company did not change the ending- that's the right and duty of any true filmmaker of merit, to make a story better- no? Obviously, they did not see the gaping flaws because on the DVD's featurette all the actors and filmmakers gush over the horribly written tale. As for the rest, the commentary is likewise banal and asskissy, but the film and sound quality are ok.Yet, it all comes down to the poor script. This film is even worse than In The Bedroom, though, because as silly and unreal as that ending was at least it was in the realm of possibility due to the darkness of certain characters and events.

Here everyone is at fault, but no one is to blame.  It is the confluence of a series of awful situations that have simple solutions that are inaccessible.The story is told as parallel revelations of the lives of Kathy (tragically performed by the wonderful Jennifer Connely), and the Behrani family (Massoud Behrani is played magnificently by Ben Kingsley).  Kathy?s life is shattered into a torpor that seems almost fatal.  She is unjustly losing her father?s house because of a bureaucratic blunder she hasn?t the energy to resist.  Massoud Behrani is an immigrant working hard to recover something like the station he had in Iran.  However, he has to work multiple menial jobs just to be broke.  Kathy?s seized property is just the opportunity he needs to get back on his feet.Into this sad and volatile situation comes Lester (well portrayed by Ron Eldard) who is the sheriff sent to evict Kathy and is also in a precarious situation in his life.  What develops between him and Kathy is destructive to both of them and leads to a disaster for everyone in the film.The story doesn't tell you how to feel about the characters.  This adds power and depth to the film because you will find yourself arguing different positions on each of the characters (except maybe Lester).  This is not the result of indifference or ambiguity as much as it is an understanding of the characters and a strong wish that things could and should be different.

Kingsley plays an Iranian man who purchases a home for his family, as an investment in order to turn a profit.  Connelly plays the owner of the home, Kathy, who gets everything ripped right out from under her feet.  Technically the house is still hers, but legally it was already sold.  You see the tax office made a mistake and accused Kathy of owing money she didn't owe, so they sold her house.  The key there is that she didn't owe anything and so now she must fight to regain ownership of her house.  The acting, as I stated early on, is a knockout punch with outstanding performances by everyone involved but more notable on Connelly's part who nailed her role and proved that 'A Beautiful Mind' was not a fluke (but anyone who has seen her in Requiem of a Dream already knows that)...I urge any and everyone to see this film.  It touches on so much more than ownership of a house but what makes us as humans whole and how we will fight to know that we matter.  Kathy fights for a house that means the world to her...it is all the stability she has left, the only part of her life that hasn't been ruined by her alcaholism and is the only thing that gives her hope of one day overcoming all and living a normal, stable life.  Massoud will fight for a house that means a future for his family.  The ending is stunning and will make you lose breath.

This movie, while dark, is deeply laden with symbolism and pathos and a relentless sense of impending doom. More than just a lament of the human condition, this is a meditation upon possessions and the fear of losing them that drives many of us to desperation. The house represents many different things to the different characters, but trying to possess the house and protect it spells disaster for all - those who fight for it and those caught in the crossfire.  The film borders on horror at times in that it exposes the fear and the despair that lead to murder and suicide.The Colonel is at once the most malevolent but also the most tragic figure here. He realizes his hubris, but only too late. How many of our lives are marked by lies, keeping up appearances and desperate acts. Watch this film for nothing else than the phenomenal performances to which the Oscar nominations should attest. These are the roles of their careers for Kingsley and Connelly.

801262,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,B0001DMVBC,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[5, 8]","I have to be painfully honest before I begin. I'm a down home protestant at heart. I spent my entire life going to Sunday school and Church. So when I sat down to write my review for THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG those pesky Ten Commandments kept jumping back into my head. Because I believe just about every commandment is represented and therefore broken it was impossible for me to not see it.Philosophically I believe humans to be fallen, and therefore evil to the core. This is not a judgement but a spiritual absolute. I have lied, stolen, coveted, and so therefore I am separated from my Creator. It is only by grace that I am not lost. I also believe the Ten Commandments to be the most practical system of laws to prove this.The characters in THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, is a great representation of this idea. In the film we are presented with two very flawed people. Two people who are fighting over a house that were taken by a bureaucratic mistake.Jennifer Connelly (The Hulk) stars as Kathy, a young woman whose life goes from bad to worse. Her husband has walked out on her, she is recovering from a substance abuse problem, and her family has very little faith in her. When her house was stolen right out from underneath her, she is forced to live in crusty motels and her car until the legal system figures it all out.You see, the government evicted her by accident and sold her house to an Iranian immigrant named Behranini (Ben Kingsly, Ghandi). Behranini has worked his entire life to make a place for his family. He once was a decorated military figure whom was forced out of his country with the Shah. He now lays gravel on the San Francisco Freeway, and works nights at a convenience store. Fiercely proud, he lives above his means so his daughter will marry well. When this foreclosed house comes on the market he sees a cash cow that can pull his family out of financial ruin.These two people are thrown into a battle for a house. Both holding on for dear life and willing to do just about anything to get what each believes they deserve. No one is guilty and yet no one is innocent.To make matters worse, there is this cop (Ron Elderd, Ghost Ship) with questionable morals whom is helping Kathy. At first it all seems innocent. He pulls some strings for her at the beginning. All seems well until they fall for each other and he leaves his family.First time Director Vadim Perelman has crafted a film that is rough around the edges and yet filled with engaging performances. He has made a film where no one is the villain, and yet everyone is. He shows just how important it is to ""Love our neighbors,"" what it means to be truly compassionate, and how easy it is for a regular guy to become a cold-blooded monster.At every turn THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG shows its audience the mirror into our own souls. While I do doubt some of the motivations (Mostly those by Elderd's characters), Perelman has gotten performances out of the actors that feel authentic.Jennifer Connelly should be up for an Oscar again. Her performance, while a little too somber, hits the right notes at the right time. The screenplay comes on a little thick, especially the scene involving the cigarette machine. But as we watch her character's slow and deliberate slide into poverty, we feel empathy and anger. She is not a hero, she is not good, but in the end she is human, and so we as the audience long to hug her.Kingsly's character is also very good. He is a man fighting with the honor of his past and also for the American Dream. He is also a man who has lost his faith in his god, and wants so desperately to have everything good. His performance only suffers when the plot drags him and his son on a journey that steals the last moments of the film away from the realm of reality.It is Elderd's character that steals believability from the film. The scenes where he is confronted by his jilted wife and his crying children feel desperate, and drag us away from the main story. His character also does too many things that feel forced. The last fifteen or twenty minutes of the film were adequate but still kind of clunky because of decisions he makes. They did not work for me as much as they should have.The end also steals the action away from Kathy and places it all in Behranini's court. Thus stealing any true revelation from Kathy. It also features Jennifer Connelly standing on a white dock looking out at the ocean. I can think of two movies that use a shot similar to this, can you?THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is so close to being perfect. I hate to harp on the entire end, because some of it works pretty well. I just hate serious character dramas that forget their characters and become slaves to their plot. But trust me, if you are looking for a film that is both challenging and really fascinating, give it a try.****1/2 out of 5",4,How Many Commandments Did You Break??,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,4844,"['have', 'be', 'painfully', 'honest', 'begin', ""'m"", 'down', 'home', 'protestant', 'heart', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'going', 'Sunday', 'school', 'Church', 'when', 'sat', 'down', 'write', 'review', 'THE', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'pesky', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'kept', 'jumping', 'back', 'head', 'believe', 'just', 'about', 'commandment', 'represented', 'therefore', 'broken', 'was', 'impossible', 'not', 'see', 'it.Philosophically', 'believe', 'humans', 'be', 'fallen', 'therefore', 'evil', 'core', 'not', 'judgement', 'spiritual', 'absolute', 'have', 'lied', 'stolen', 'coveted', 'so', 'therefore', 'am', 'separated', 'Creator', 'only', 'grace', 'am', 'not', 'lost', 'also', 'believe', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'be', 'most', 'practical', 'system', 'laws', 'prove', 'this.The', 'characters', 'THE', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'great', 'representation', 'idea', 'film', 'are', 'presented', 'two', 'very', 'flawed', 'people', 'Two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'fighting', 'house', 'were', 'taken', 'bureaucratic', 'mistake.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Hulk', 'Kathy', 'young', 'woman', 'life', 'bad', 'worse', 'husband', 'walked', 'out', 'recovering', 'substance', 'abuse', 'problem', 'family', 'very', 'little', 'faith', 'When', 'house', 'was', 'stolen', 'right', 'forced', 'live', 'crusty', 'motels', 'car', 'legal', 'system', 'figures', 'out.You', 'see', 'government', 'evicted', 'accident', 'sold', 'house', 'Iranian', 'immigrant', 'named', 'Behranini', 'Ben', 'Kingsly', 'Ghandi', 'Behranini', 'worked', 'entire', 'life', 'make', 'place', 'family', 'once', 'was', 'decorated', 'military', 'figure', 'whom', 'was', 'forced', 'country', 'Shah', 'now', 'gravel', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Freeway', 'nights', 'convenience', 'store', 'Fiercely', 'proud', 'means', 'daughter', 'will', 'marry', 'well', 'When', 'foreclosed', 'house', 'market', 'cash', 'cow', 'can', 'pull', 'family', 'financial', 'ruin.These', 'two', 'people', 'are', 'thrown', 'battle', 'house', 'holding', 'dear', 'life', 'willing', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'get', 'what', 'deserve', 'one', 'guilty', 'yet', 'one', 'innocent.To', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'cop', 'Ron', 'Elderd', 'Ghost', 'Ship', 'questionable', 'morals', 'whom', 'helping', 'Kathy', 'first', 'innocent', 'strings', 'beginning', 'well', 'fall', 'other', 'family.First', 'time', 'Director', 'Vadim', 'Perelman', 'crafted', 'film', 'rough', 'edges', 'yet', 'filled', 'engaging', 'performances', 'made', 'film', 'where', 'one', 'villain', 'yet', 'everyone', 'just', 'how', 'important', 'Love', 'neighbors', 'what', 'be', 'truly', 'compassionate', 'how', 'easy', 'regular', 'guy', 'become', 'cold-blooded', 'monster.At', 'turn', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'audience', 'mirror', 'own', 'souls', 'do', 'doubt', 'motivations', 'Mostly', 'Elderd', 'characters', 'Perelman', 'gotten', 'performances', 'actors', 'feel', 'authentic.Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'should', 'be', 'up', 'Oscar', 'again', 'performance', 'little', 'too', 'somber', 'right', 'notes', 'right', 'time', 'screenplay', 'little', 'thick', 'especially', 'scene', 'involving', 'cigarette', 'machine', 'watch', 'character', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'slide', 'poverty', 'feel', 'empathy', 'anger', 'not', 'hero', 'not', 'good', 'end', 'human', 'so', 'audience', 'long', 'hug', 'her.Kingsly', 'character', 'also', 'very', 'good', 'man', 'fighting', 'honor', 'past', 'also', 'American', 'Dream', 'also', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'faith', 'god', 'so', 'desperately', 'have', 'everything', 'good', 'performance', 'only', 'when', 'plot', 'son', 'journey', 'last', 'moments', 'film', 'away', 'realm', 'reality.It', 'Elderd', 'character', 'steals', 'believability', 'film', 'scenes', 'where', 'confronted', 'jilted', 'wife', 'crying', 'children', 'feel', 'desperate', 'drag', 'away', 'main', 'story', 'character', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'things', 'feel', 'forced', 'last', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'were', 'adequate', 'still', 'kind', 'clunky', 'decisions', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'have.The', 'end', 'also', 'action', 'away', 'Kathy', 'places', 'Behranini', 'court', 'Thus', 'stealing', 'true', 'revelation', 'Kathy', 'also', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'standing', 'white', 'dock', 'looking', 'out', 'ocean', 'can', 'think', 'two', 'movies', 'use', 'shot', 'similar', 'can', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'so', 'close', 'being', 'perfect', 'hate', 'harp', 'entire', 'end', 'pretty', 'well', 'just', 'hate', 'serious', 'character', 'dramas', 'forget', 'characters', 'become', 'slaves', 'plot', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'challenging', 'really', 'fascinating', 'give', 'try', '****1/2', '5']",N/A

The plot is wonderfully adapted from the book version of the same name.  It brilliantly combines two lives that later meet: a woman who's life is tumbling downward after having been evicted from her house and an Iranian family who buys that house only as an investment.  The emotional impact is never held back for a moment, which continually builds as the struggles become more intense.  Later, it becomes more than a film about a woman trying to move back into her house.  Its unique chain of events keep audiences awaiting for what happens next.  The Oscar-nominated original score wonderfully accompanies the scenery.Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo give wonderful Oscar nominated performances (Best Actor/ Best Supporting Actress).  Their characters' passions and hardtimes are expressed beautifully.  Kingsley proves that he's continually evolved as an actor through his entire career.

Kingsley and actors I didn't recognize are outstanding as the Irani family. Connelly played the part of Cathy just as I imagined it in the book.

801268,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B0001DMVBC,Dennis Littrell,"[2, 4]","Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley in an Oscar-nominated performance) is working two jobs, one as a road construction worker and the other as a clerk/manager in a convenience store.  He is a meticulous man, a man of dignity and pride.  He has a wife Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and a teenaged son.  They immigrated to the US from Iran where he was a colonel in the air force.  They had a house in the days of the Shan on the Caspian Sea that they have no longer.One day Behrani sees an ad for a repossessed house up for auction.  This is the house of the title.  It is owned by Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly) and her brother.  We see her asleep in the house, which has gone to some disrepair, dirty dishes in the sink, unopened mail on the living room floor.  She is awakened by a phone call from her mother on the east coast.  It's 6 a.m.  Kathy seems hung over.  Her mother is coming to visit in a couple of weeks.  Kathy says her husband will be out of down.  She says he is lying next to her now, asleep.  However he isn't.Kathy is in a bad way.  She is a recovering alcoholic.  We can imagine her husband left her because of her drinking.  She is trying to quit smoking.  And worse yet, there comes a banging on the door and she learns that the house is being taken from her for back taxes.  Signs are plastered on the doors.  A county sheriff Lester (Ron Eldard) is there to make her exit the premises.We can see the clash of cultures coming: the proud, hard-working immigrant who is going to buy the house dirt cheap and then sell it for a profit, the careless and self-indulgent American who is going to go live in her car.Sheriff Lester is the joker in the deck.  He is bored with his wife, whom he married young after growing up with her.  He immediately takes a fancy to Kathy, and we can see that he will be instrumental in trying to get the house back.So this is the premise of the movie.  There are some problems with this premise, but they are minor.  Behrani buys the house for forty-some thousand dollars and puts it up for sale for an hundred and seventy-some thousand.  These numbers are pathetically low for the time, the 1990s, and the location, the San Francisco Bay area.  Kathy is left with nothing.  However after the taxes are paid she should be getting what's left of the forty-thousand.  The direction by Vidim Perelman in his debut glosses over this.  Furthermore, Kathy should be suing the county since they are the ones who wrongfully assessed her for a business tax.What makes this movie work is the fine storyline, adapted by Perelman from the novel by Andre Dubus III, and superior performances by Ben Kingsley, Shohreh Aghdashloo, and Jennifer Connelly.  Kingsley becomes the Iranian colonel in the most convincing manner.  His motivations are clear and believable.  His character is rounded and at once sympathetic and a bit off-putting.  He is sexist and macho but at the same time civilized, compassionate and even admirable.  Connelly, in her stringy hair and cheap cut offs becomes an injured and lost bird that has flown into this house that is no longer hers, this house that symbolizes both the American dream and the dream of the immigrant.  I have seen her in a couple of other movies, most notably in A Beautiful Mind (2001).  She is striking to look at, and here she proves she is a very talented actress.  Her ability to turn her character from one that we are disposed to dislike to one for whom we feel great sympathy is part of what make this a superior film.Aghdashloo, whose work got her a  nomination for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 2004, also gives a fine performance in a delicate role requiring understanding and compassion.  It is perhaps fitting that she was born in Tehran and speaks Farsi.  (Excellent casting overall, by the way.)Also notable is the original score by James Horner, which also received an Oscar nomination.This movie is not only a work of art, but is intriguingly plotted so that what develops and how it ends are not easily predicted.  The ending for some may seem a bit stagy, but I believe that Kingsley sold it well, and considering his character, it is quite plausible.",5,Affecting performances and an intriguing storyline,1174953600,"03 27, 2007",2007,4151,"['Amir', 'Behrani', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Oscar-nominated', 'performance', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'one', 'road', 'construction', 'worker', 'other', 'clerk/manager', 'convenience', 'store', 'meticulous', 'man', 'man', 'dignity', 'pride', 'wife', 'Nadi', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'teenaged', 'son', 'immigrated', 'US', 'Iran', 'where', 'was', 'colonel', 'air', 'force', 'had', 'house', 'days', 'Shan', 'Caspian', 'Sea', 'have', 'longer.One', 'day', 'Behrani', 'ad', 'repossessed', 'house', 'up', 'auction', 'house', 'title', 'owned', 'Kathy', 'Nicolo', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'brother', 'see', 'asleep', 'house', 'gone', 'disrepair', 'dirty', 'dishes', 'sink', 'unopened', 'mail', 'living', 'room', 'floor', 'awakened', 'phone', 'call', 'mother', 'east', 'coast', '6', 'a.m.', 'Kathy', 'hung', 'mother', 'coming', 'visit', 'couple', 'weeks', 'Kathy', 'husband', 'will', 'be', 'down', 'lying', 'next', 'now', 'asleep', 'However', 'bad', 'way', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'can', 'imagine', 'husband', 'left', 'drinking', 'trying', 'quit', 'smoking', 'worse', 'yet', 'banging', 'door', 'house', 'being', 'taken', 'back', 'taxes', 'Signs', 'are', 'plastered', 'doors', 'county', 'sheriff', 'Lester', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'there', 'make', 'exit', 'premises.We', 'can', 'see', 'clash', 'cultures', 'coming', 'proud', 'hard-working', 'immigrant', 'who', 'going', 'buy', 'house', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'then', 'sell', 'profit', 'careless', 'self-indulgent', 'American', 'who', 'going', 'go', 'live', 'car.Sheriff', 'Lester', 'joker', 'deck', 'bored', 'wife', 'whom', 'married', 'young', 'growing', 'up', 'immediately', 'fancy', 'Kathy', 'can', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'instrumental', 'trying', 'get', 'house', 'back.So', 'premise', 'movie', 'are', 'problems', 'premise', 'are', 'minor', 'Behrani', 'house', 'forty-some', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'up', 'sale', 'hundred', 'seventy-some', 'thousand', 'numbers', 'are', 'pathetically', 'low', 'time', '1990s', 'location', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Bay', 'area', 'Kathy', 'left', 'nothing', 'However', 'taxes', 'are', 'paid', 'should', 'be', 'getting', 'what', 'left', 'forty-thousand', 'direction', 'Vidim', 'Perelman', 'debut', 'Furthermore', 'Kathy', 'should', 'be', 'suing', 'county', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'wrongfully', 'assessed', 'business', 'movie', 'work', 'fine', 'storyline', 'adapted', 'Perelman', 'novel', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'III', 'superior', 'performances', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kingsley', 'Iranian', 'colonel', 'most', 'convincing', 'manner', 'motivations', 'are', 'clear', 'believable', 'character', 'rounded', 'once', 'sympathetic', 'bit', 'off-putting', 'sexist', 'macho', 'same', 'time', 'civilized', 'compassionate', 'even', 'admirable', 'Connelly', 'stringy', 'hair', 'cheap', 'cut', 'offs', 'injured', 'lost', 'bird', 'flown', 'house', 'longer', 'hers', 'house', 'American', 'dream', 'dream', 'immigrant', 'have', 'seen', 'couple', 'other', 'movies', 'most', 'notably', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', '2001', 'striking', 'look', 'here', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'ability', 'turn', 'character', 'one', 'are', 'disposed', 'dislike', 'one', 'whom', 'feel', 'great', 'sympathy', 'part', 'what', 'make', 'superior', 'film.Aghdashloo', 'work', 'got', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'Oscar', '2004', 'also', 'fine', 'performance', 'delicate', 'role', 'requiring', 'understanding', 'compassion', 'perhaps', 'fitting', 'was', 'born', 'Tehran', 'Farsi', 'Excellent', 'casting', 'overall', 'way', 'Also', 'notable', 'original', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'also', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination.This', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'work', 'art', 'intriguingly', 'plotted', 'so', 'what', 'how', 'are', 'not', 'easily', 'predicted', 'ending', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'stagy', 'believe', 'Kingsley', 'sold', 'well', 'considering', 'character', 'quite', 'plausible']",N/A

As we become adults, raise families, and live in homes, we learn to deal with the ever-increasing likelihood of loss.Depressed following the death of her father, and the abandonment by her husband, Kathy (played by Jennifer Connely, Requiem For A Dream, A Beautiful Mind) waits too long to save the only tether grounding her wavering soul to the shore below.Discovering her error too late, she is left at the mercy of a man trying to make a life for himself in America, after fleeing Iran with his wife and son.Ben Kingsley(Gandhi, Schindler's List) plays Amir Behrani, a forward-thinking man, full of folly. He places value of objects over people, treating the women in his life like dolls to sit in their houses, look pretty, remain obedient, and never argue.Amir's staunch drive to make a success in his new country leads him into a world where objectification, even to things of high emotional content, can lead to obscurity. Mistakes are easy to make when one is clouded by too small a vision.Based on the novel of the same name, House of Sand And Fog is beautifully shot, intensely scored, and masterfully acted by Kingsley, Connely, and Shohreh Angdashloo (who plays Mrs. Behrani with delicious subtlety). They all deserve Academy nods.As a film, it is flawed by a lackluster story, which is as manipulative as such yarns as The Bridges of Madison County, and Steel Magnolias. Unlike the latter, it does not make up for such heart-tugging with clever adaptations of story.There are too many cheats at Connely's situation. The choice of location for the house does not resonate as powerfully as it should. The character of Lester (Ron Eldard, Deep Impact) is a wasteland of cheap exposition and romantic digression.The film does not deserve its three beacons of brilliance. We see plenty of fog, which has many uses in story and mise-en-scene.

Roberts ""Hadrian12""","[4, 5]","This is a painful reminder of what can happen when the law of unintended consequences follows in-step with what would seem to be a banal clerical error.  Lives become unraveled in ways you could hardly imagine.The story details a house owned by a young woman (played by Jennifer Connelly).  Somehow, she is pinged for not paying a business tax (which she does not owe).  After ignoring her mail, the house is re-possessed.  Within a day it is auctioned off to an Iranian family (the head of the household is played by Ben Kingsley).The balance of the film portrays  the heart-wrenching obstacles that she must go through to try and get her house back.  In short, the whole ordeal is a legal and logistical mess.One of the most salient aspects of the film is that there are no real villains in it.  We never see the clerk(s) who screwed up in the 1st place.  The personages in the film are all basically good people, but are driven to take desperate action when the legal apparatus fails to resolve the situation.The acting is top notch, and is worth the price of the DVD alone.  I've always thought that Ben Kingsley was an under-rated actor, and he shines in perhaps his most powerful performance.  Jennifer Connolley is an outstanding actress who has the most passionate eyes I have ever seen in my life.If ever there were a Real Estate deal gone awry that could be elevated to the realm of a Shakespearian tragedy, this is it.

But I can say that if the Academy actually decided to make it a tie and give him one as well as whoever won (don't remember), I would feel as if justice was served.THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is a study in irony, as well as one of the most incredible morality plays I have ever seen.  The integrity of Ben Kingsley's character, an Iranian General now immigrant in the United States with his spoiled, often materialistic and strangely immature but loving, dutiful wife, gives a marriage that has a window into another culture unlike anything I have seen before.  One could believe intellectually that Iran has much of the same class issues that Americans or Europeans have, but not actually believe it in the heart until seeing this.  How he and his family crash headlong into the depressed narcissism, immature irresponsibility, and naturally violent tendencies of these representatives of white American culture in the movie, and how each actor shows just how completely American lives are often best defined by the lack of true love in them, is shocking, ironic, disturbing, and somehow strangely redemptive by the movie's shocking end.This movie hurts before it heals.

Jennifer Connelly is Kathy, a self-destructive alcoholic whose husband has abandoned her.  She has nothing except the house that she inherited from her beloved father.  Because of a misunderstanding, the house is taken away from her for non-payment of taxes.  The new owner is Colonel Behrani, a proud Iranian expatriate played unforgettably by the towering actor, Ben Kingsley.  Soon Kathy and Behrani become adversaries, and they enter upon a collision course for possession of the house.Kathy is joined in her quest by a police officer named Lester who leaves his wife and children for her.  The director explores their relationship as well as that of Behrani and his beautiful and devoted wife, played touchingly by Shohreh Aghdashloo.  Behrani has suffered a loss of dignity with his family's move to America, and he has no intention of giving up his dream of regaining his former stature. Jennifer Connelley is outstanding as a lost soul whose self-esteem has been eroded by years of drinking and dissolution.Adding to the movie's aura of doom are the fog-laden cinematography by Roger Deakins and the evocative original score by James Horner.

801279,A146D2LYLICNLS,B0001DMVBC,eric_f,"[1, 2]","I remember reading Andre Dubus' ""House Of Sand And Fog"" a couple of years ago. While not among the best books I've ever read, I did find it to be an interesting and worthwhile read that stuck with me long after I finished the last page. And when I heard that it was becoming a movie adaptation my interest in the story was immediately renewed. Today I went to see it and can say without reservation that this is one of the very rare instances when a film version surpasses the novel.Ben Kingsley gives yet another superb performance in his role as Colonel Behrani. Equally as convincing is Jennifer Connelly who plays Kathy Nicolo, the desperate and determined woman who will stop at nothing to claim her house back which Behrani has purchased at auction price because she neglected to pay her taxes on it. Both Kingsley and Connelly are simply excellent in their roles. Ron Eldard plays Sheriff Lester Burdon, a cop who is unhappily married and starts an affair with Kathy, taking her under his wing and promising to get her house back. I found Eldard's performance to be a little wooden at times but for the most part he pulled it off well.The same amount of praise also goes to director Vadim Perelman and the rest of the crew who worked behind the scenes to give ""House Of Sand And Fog"" the perfect atmosphere and setting. The house used in the movie was EXACTLY how I had envisioned it as I read the book.It should also be noted that this movie adaptation remains very faithful to the book with the exception of the ending which was a little different. For example, those of you who have read the book will notice that Behrani doesn't try to strangle Kathy in this movie version. There are other minor differences, especially during the final minutes, but to reveal them would give away the ending for those not familiar with the story.To sum up, ""House Of Sand And Fog"" is definitely one of the better movies to come out this year that offers both a good story and great acting. Don't expect a happy ending because there is none; this story is about tragic people making tragic decisions. But it's an engaging plot nonetheless.

801281,A6VS2DC7YFQOE,B0001DMVBC,Erik,"[11, 26]","Only a complete schmuck can take two oscar-winning actors (Connelly and Kingsley) and do nothing with their talents, but that's exactly what director Vadim Perelman does in this wannabe tear-jerker.The main problem with the film is that it's plot is laughable at best and surely does not justify the reactions of the characters.  The premise is that Connelly's character is a strung-out abandoned wife that (for some reason other than the necessity for a plot) forgets to open her mail for the past few weeks (months, who knows?).  If she would have checked her mail she would have seen that the county was about to seize her house for a negligent $500 business tax that she never actually owed.  So, her house is taken, and Iranian immigrant Kingsley buys it for his family.  It turns out that the county made a mistake and offers to buy the house back for Connelly, but the market could pay Kingsley 4 times their offer so he refuses.  And this is where the plot just becomes ridiculous.In between sniffles and petty confessions, Connelly says that her father worked 30 years for the house, she has lots of memories of it, blah blah blah.  Cry me a river Justin Timberlake.  Because Kingsley won't sell the house back to her, she completely loses it, daily obsesses over the property, sleeps with a field officer to get his help and tries to blow her brains out (but there aren't any bullets in the gun) and then overdoses to try to kill herself.  All this because it would take months, and not 2 weeks to get her house back.  Seriously, that's that whole reason.  What???  Jennifer Connelly plays an emotionally unstable and high-strung loser?  Who saw that one coming?  One thing about Connelly is that she's consistent in her roles (Dark City and A Beautiful Mind excepted).  Talk about type-casting.The only worthy performances were by Kingsley and Aghdashloo.  Besides them, everyone else was pretty static.  There was very little character development.  It was just character exposure.  Nobody changed, their personalities just became more apparent.  The most annoying character was the officer that first helped Connelly move out of her house, then (though married with two kids) has an affair with her, leaves his wife and kids and takes up the banner of Connelly's cause.  He harasses Kingsley and his family and just plays the typical power freak that abuses the little power he has once he's got it.  Did I mention that his acting is awful?  It is, and so are his lines.  It's like a high-schooler wrote the dialogue of this movie.  Cliches abound as do cliched characters.  What a disappointment.  Even Kingsley's superb performance couldn't save this dribble.As things progressed, the movie became so limp, that the writer obviously thought, ""Hmm, this story sucks noodles and should be over in thirty minutes, but wait!  I got it!  I'll throw in an irrational cop, a death scene and a husband-wife suicide!  That will save it!Just when things are about to be resolved, for no other reason other than to perform emergency CPR on this dying film, Kingsley's son gets accidentally shot dead by two police officers when he pulls the bad cop's gun and tries to save his dad from him.  Distraught with his son's death, Kingsley runs around for about five minutes crying at the sky with his son's blood on his hands and shirt.  He drives home and, to spare his wife news of their son's death, he poisons her tea and kills her.  How loving.  Then he dresses up in his Iranian Colonel uniform, lies down in bed next to his wife, and tapes a plastic bag over his head and suffocates himself.  Connelly, for some reason, has a feeling that things aren't right so she runs up to their/her house.  Wow, not only is Connelly a strung-out tramp, but she's also psychic!  She finds them dead, cries her eyes out and curls up in a fetal position on the bed with the only two people that kept me watching most of this flop.Well, that's it folks.

The film centres around 2 key characters. One is a troubled young woman who is wrongfully evicted from her home and the other is a determined Iranian immigrant who works as hard as he can to provide for his family. The two meet under unfortunate circumstances and unwillingly set off a chain of events that escalates into madness and tragedy. There are several victims in this film. The first being Connelly who is injustly thrown out in to the streets. The second is the determined Kingsley who is unjustly thrown into emotional turmoil by the thought of buying a house that rightfully belongs to someone else. The third is Kingsley's family, who after finding out what has occurred are  thrown in to the chaos. And lastly, Ron Eldard, Connelly's only ally who becomes a victim of his consuming passion for her.This film is dark and depressing and the characters are all sad and gloomy adding pathos to the already somber tone of the film. The film made me furious  because it was very difficult to pick a side. Although the film is not based on a true story, you can kind of see something like this happening in real life and the tragic characters are so expertly played by the actors, most notably Ben Kingsley, Jennifer Connelly and Shohreh Aghdashloo, that your heart goes out to every single individual in the film. Aghdashloo's performance as Kingsley's wife is especially spellbinding and her incredible performance haunted me for days. Her character is emotionally rich. She emanates kindness and grace and she is the most sympathetic person in the film.

801283,A2LRWMHJ1ZK36M,B0001DMVBC,e. verrillo,"[4, 4]","*SPOILER ALERT* This was one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. I wept steadily through most of it. And then it ended. I wept a little more, and then I started to think.The plot of this movie revolves around a house that represents something profound for two people. The owner, a troubled young woman who has been abandoned by her husband, loses her family home because she fails to pay a tax which she doesn't actually owe. The house is purchased by an Iranian immigrant, Behrani, a former colonel, who hopes to regain his lost happiness with a house by the sea. The clash between the desires of these two dreamers, each longing for something quite similar, forms the basis of this film. Tragedy is inevitable.What I can't understand is the logic. For example, we see the colonel working two jobs, as a road laborer and as a cashier at a mini-mart, in order to keep his family living in a very comfortable apartment. Anybody else working those two low-paying jobs wouldn't be able to afford a place half that nice. And then, he pays $45,000 in cash for the new house. Where did that money come from? And why did he immediately quit his jobs? How did merely owning a house improve his current financial situation? Logically, it should have gotten worse. Repairs, improvements, closing costs, title insurance, real estate taxes ... owning a house is expensive.Then there is the manner in which Kathy loses her house. She doesn't pay $500 in ""business"" tax and the county takes her house away? That makes no sense. Real estate taxes are in the thousands. If she had been paying those, then there would be no grounds for taking her house. What's more, she'd only been remiss for eight months. It takes two to three years to repossess a house. If it goes up for auction, it won't be sold in one day - even if the purchaser pays in cash. There is a title search that needs to be done, and various legal papers to file. It takes several weeks to close on a house. During that process, which is done by an independent lawyer, Kathy's ""debt"" would have been rectified. Not to mention the fact that Kathy was only a part owner. Before taking over the house, the county would have had to notify the other owner, her brother, who would doubtless have prevented his sister from being evicted.Then there was the matter of the sheriff/boyfriend. I have never seen an officer leave his weapon in the trunk of a car, much less run around with it tucked into the back of his pants. Even given those stupidities, why was an Internal Affairs review conducted in the space of an afternoon? Reviews take days, weeks. Even if we buy the fact that a review was conducted in a couple of hours, and that the sheriff was in disgrace, why did he still have his gun and badge? And why was he thrown in jail after a different officer gunned down Behrani's son? Wouldn't there have been charges against the officer who actually shot the boy? A trial? Something?The more I think about it, the less sense this movie makes. This is good. Now I can stop crying.",3,"Beautiful, compelling, but very illogical",1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,3032,"['*SPOILER', 'ALERT*', 'was', 'one', 'saddest', 'movies', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'wept', 'steadily', 'most', 'then', 'ended', 'wept', 'little', 'more', 'then', 'started', 'think.The', 'plot', 'movie', 'house', 'something', 'profound', 'two', 'people', 'owner', 'troubled', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'family', 'home', 'pay', 'tax', ""n't"", 'actually', 'owe', 'house', 'purchased', 'Iranian', 'immigrant', 'Behrani', 'former', 'colonel', 'who', 'regain', 'lost', 'happiness', 'house', 'sea', 'clash', 'desires', 'two', 'dreamers', 'longing', 'something', 'quite', 'similar', 'basis', 'film', 'Tragedy', 'inevitable.What', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'logic', 'example', 'see', 'colonel', 'working', 'two', 'jobs', 'road', 'laborer', 'cashier', 'mini-mart', 'order', 'keep', 'family', 'living', 'very', 'comfortable', 'apartment', 'Anybody', 'else', 'working', 'two', 'low-paying', 'jobs', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'afford', 'place', 'half', 'nice', 'then', '45,000', 'cash', 'new', 'house', 'Where', 'did', 'money', 'come', 'why', 'did', 'immediately', 'quit', 'jobs', 'How', 'did', 'merely', 'owning', 'house', 'improve', 'current', 'financial', 'situation', 'Logically', 'should', 'have', 'gotten', 'worse', 'Repairs', 'improvements', 'closing', 'costs', 'title', 'insurance', 'real', 'estate', 'taxes', 'owning', 'house', 'expensive.Then', 'manner', 'Kathy', 'house', ""n't"", 'pay', '500', 'business', 'tax', 'county', 'house', 'away', 'sense', 'Real', 'estate', 'taxes', 'are', 'thousands', 'had', 'been', 'paying', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'grounds', 'taking', 'house', 'What', 'more', ""'d"", 'only', 'been', 'remiss', 'eight', 'months', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'repossess', 'house', 'up', 'auction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sold', 'one', 'day', 'even', 'purchaser', 'cash', 'title', 'search', 'be', 'done', 'various', 'legal', 'papers', 'file', 'several', 'weeks', 'close', 'house', 'process', 'done', 'independent', 'lawyer', 'Kathy', 'debt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'rectified', 'Not', 'mention', 'fact', 'Kathy', 'was', 'only', 'part', 'owner', 'taking', 'over', 'house', 'county', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'notify', 'other', 'owner', 'brother', 'who', 'would', 'doubtless', 'have', 'prevented', 'sister', 'being', 'was', 'matter', 'sheriff/boyfriend', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'officer', 'leave', 'weapon', 'trunk', 'car', 'much', 'less', 'run', 'tucked', 'back', 'pants', 'Even', 'given', 'stupidities', 'why', 'was', 'Internal', 'Affairs', 'review', 'conducted', 'space', 'afternoon', 'Reviews', 'take', 'days', 'weeks', 'Even', 'buy', 'fact', 'review', 'was', 'conducted', 'couple', 'hours', 'sheriff', 'was', 'disgrace', 'why', 'did', 'still', 'have', 'gun', 'badge', 'why', 'was', 'thrown', 'jail', 'different', 'officer', 'gunned', 'down', 'Behrani', 'son', 'Would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'charges', 'officer', 'who', 'actually', 'shot', 'boy', 'trial', 'Something', 'more', 'think', 'less', 'sense', 'movie', 'good', 'Now', 'can', 'stop', 'crying']",N/A

For those who have not read the book or seen Director Vadim Perelman's excellent adaptation I would refer you to the several excellent plot outlines supplied on the product page for this movie.  Simply put, this is a story at whose core is a house whose ownership triggers reactions from everyone in the tale.  The sensitivity of Dubus' novel and Perelman's adaptation lies in the way the similarities of each of the characters are essentially laid on a flat line of synergy.  A house is bequeathed to girl who has nothing but a lineage claim to the structure which is usurped by the government in a technical error, sold at auction to an Iranian man living with his wife and son in a strange land without any of the amenities of his previous life as a dignitary in Iran.  The middleman in this contested house is a deputy whose longing to leave his own life of complacency for a taste of passion he has never known.  Everybody is basically needy, grasping for some semblance of security, meaning, and ownership.  It all is built on sand and is as elusive as fog.  Each is driven to ends thought inconceivable and yet there is finally a sense of just what it is to be an isolated human on this globe that can be unkind.Ben Kingsley surpasses past achievements as Behrani, a man of such bruised pride and longing for substance that he fosters his own descent into hopelessness.  Jennifer Connelly once again proves that her spectrum of acting is ever-widening as she makes Kathy a credible victim with a crusted heart of forgiveness.  Ron Eldard allows us to see inside his Deputy and feel his longings even though we may not side with his choices.  Iranian actress Shohreh Agdashloo is powerful as the fully realized wife for Behrani and her responses to all of the incidents are heart-wrenchingly beautiful.

801293,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,B0001DMVBC,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 1]","Both the book and the movie have almost as many detractors as admirers.  In my own case, I found that the book packed such an emotional wallop that I was wary of any cinematic effort to tell this seemingly straightforward (but ultimately quite tricky) story.  When I finally did see it, it was on a smallish black and white TV at a friend's house.  I didn't care much for the film version then.  Like so many adaptations, it seemed too rushed, too skimpy on the characters ""back stories"" and their complex inner lives.  The acting was good, but too much of the dialogue seemed expository to me and not as ""authentic"" as the dialogue in the novel.Seeing it in color and on a much larger screen, as I did recently, did give me a somewhat different perspective.  The sheer beauty of the film was lost on me on the little black and white TV.  As someone below noted, it's hard to go wrong with the Pacific Coast as your background.  True, but the cinematography is more than just pretty to look at.  Here the stunning nature shots serve as a reminder that the human activity--no matter how high the stakes are for those involved--is ultimately petty, perhaps even meaningless, in the grand scheme of things.I'm not surprised that many viewers (particularly those who have not read the book) find the plot overly schematic on the one hand, and the characters' actions almost inexplicable on the other.  The ""back stories"" really are essential to understanding the characters' motivations.  And without resorting to too many flashbacks or hokey ""let me tell you my story"" dialogue, there's only so much of that you can really insert into a movie.What flashbacks there are are limited to a few brief shots of Colonel Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) and family's life in the Iran of the time of the Shah.  Presumably, the filmmakers felt that an American audience would need a little more information in their case than they might with the American born characters.  It doesn't hurt either that writer director Vadim Perelman also threw in a wedding scene (only alluded to in the book) that also gives the audience a flavor of Iranian culture and values.The general's nemesis in this real estate tug of war is an emotionally fragile, recovering addict named Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connolly) whose personal story is perhaps all too common a one, one we've certainly seen before.  The details of her previous life are skimpier, but we kind of know where she's coming from.Less clear, in the context of the film, are the motivation of the renegade police officer who abandons his wife and children to become Kathy's knight in shining  (blue) armor.  I imagine for those unfamiliar with the novel, his sudden abandonment of his family and (although this was not his intent originally) his career makes little dramatic sense.  It is certainly problematic--and a little too rushed--in the context of the film.  But Ron Eldard succeeds in giving us some hint of the turbulence going on inside the man.  No mean feat since he has comparatively less to work with than either Kingsley or Connolly.The actors work hard (and succeed, I think) in making their characters actions plausible within the context of the story. Of course, a common criticism of both the film AND the book is that its characters are ""unlikeable"" and not especially sympathetic, although some are more inclined to empathize with the Colonel and his family, given their plight as refugees and their characteristic dignity and pride.  Others seeing him as part of the Shah's brutally repressive regime might find him more reprehensible than the two principle American born characters, whose ""crimes"" might be viewed as ""small timey"" by comparison and their victims mainly themselves.No matter how you slice it, however, the point of great storytelling is not to just evoke sympathy for characters we naturally like anyway.  It's considerably MORE difficult to make the reader or viewer feel compassion for characters we might not be drawn to in real life...ones we might even avoid contact with.  The film version is not quite as successful as the book in evoking that reaction--and plainly, neither the book OR the film won everyone over.  But for those open to it, the story is a strangely compelling one.  It reminds us of just how easily lives can spiral out of control.  In that, this particular tragedy--with its elements of cross-cultural misunderstanding and class and gender conflict--says a good deal about us all.",4,Better The 2nd Time Around,1214611200,"06 28, 2008",2008,4475,"['book', 'movie', 'have', 'almost', 'many', 'detractors', 'admirers', 'own', 'case', 'found', 'book', 'packed', 'such', 'emotional', 'wallop', 'was', 'wary', 'cinematic', 'effort', 'tell', 'seemingly', 'straightforward', 'ultimately', 'quite', 'tricky', 'story', 'When', 'finally', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'smallish', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'friend', 'house', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'film', 'version', 'then', 'so', 'many', 'adaptations', 'seemed', 'too', 'rushed', 'too', 'skimpy', 'characters', 'back', 'stories', 'complex', 'inner', 'lives', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'seemed', 'expository', 'not', 'authentic', 'dialogue', 'novel.Seeing', 'color', 'much', 'larger', 'screen', 'did', 'recently', 'did', 'give', 'somewhat', 'different', 'perspective', 'sheer', 'beauty', 'film', 'was', 'lost', 'little', 'black', 'white', 'TV', 'someone', 'noted', 'hard', 'go', 'wrong', 'Pacific', 'Coast', 'background', 'True', 'cinematography', 'more', 'just', 'pretty', 'look', 'Here', 'stunning', 'nature', 'shots', 'serve', 'reminder', 'human', 'activity', 'matter', 'how', 'high', 'stakes', 'are', 'involved', 'ultimately', 'petty', 'perhaps', 'even', 'meaningless', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'surprised', 'many', 'viewers', 'particularly', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'find', 'plot', 'overly', 'schematic', 'one', 'hand', 'characters', 'actions', 'almost', 'inexplicable', 'other', 'back', 'stories', 'really', 'are', 'essential', 'understanding', 'characters', 'motivations', 'resorting', 'too', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'hokey', 'let', 'tell', 'story', 'dialogue', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'can', 'really', 'insert', 'movie.What', 'are', 'are', 'limited', 'few', 'brief', 'shots', 'Colonel', 'Massoud', 'Behrani', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'family', 'life', 'Iran', 'time', 'Shah', 'Presumably', 'filmmakers', 'felt', 'American', 'audience', 'would', 'need', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'case', 'might', 'American', 'born', 'characters', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'writer', 'director', 'Vadim', 'Perelman', 'also', 'threw', 'wedding', 'scene', 'only', 'alluded', 'book', 'also', 'audience', 'flavor', 'Iranian', 'culture', 'values.The', 'general', 'nemesis', 'real', 'estate', 'tug', 'war', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'recovering', 'addict', 'named', 'Kathy', 'Nicolo', 'Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'personal', 'story', 'perhaps', 'too', 'common', 'one', 'one', ""'ve"", 'certainly', 'seen', 'before', 'details', 'previous', 'life', 'are', 'skimpier', 'kind', 'know', 'where', 'coming', 'from.Less', 'clear', 'context', 'film', 'are', 'motivation', 'renegade', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'wife', 'children', 'become', 'Kathy', 'knight', 'shining', 'blue', 'armor', 'imagine', 'unfamiliar', 'novel', 'sudden', 'abandonment', 'family', 'was', 'not', 'intent', 'originally', 'career', 'little', 'dramatic', 'sense', 'certainly', 'problematic', 'little', 'too', 'rushed', 'context', 'film', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'giving', 'hint', 'turbulence', 'going', 'man', 'mean', 'feat', 'comparatively', 'less', 'work', 'Kingsley', 'Connolly.The', 'actors', 'work', 'hard', 'succeed', 'think', 'making', 'characters', 'actions', 'plausible', 'context', 'story', 'course', 'common', 'criticism', 'film', 'book', 'characters', 'are', 'unlikeable', 'not', 'especially', 'sympathetic', 'are', 'more', 'inclined', 'empathize', 'Colonel', 'family', 'given', 'plight', 'refugees', 'characteristic', 'dignity', 'pride', 'Others', 'seeing', 'part', 'Shah', 'brutally', 'repressive', 'regime', 'might', 'find', 'more', 'reprehensible', 'two', 'principle', 'American', 'born', 'characters', 'crimes', 'might', 'be', 'viewed', 'small', 'timey', 'comparison', 'victims', 'mainly', 'themselves.No', 'matter', 'how', 'slice', 'however', 'point', 'great', 'storytelling', 'not', 'just', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'characters', 'naturally', 'anyway', 'considerably', 'MORE', 'difficult', 'make', 'reader', 'viewer', 'feel', 'compassion', 'characters', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'drawn', 'real', 'life', 'ones', 'might', 'even', 'avoid', 'contact', 'film', 'version', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'successful', 'book', 'evoking', 'reaction', 'plainly', 'book', 'OR', 'film', 'won', 'everyone', 'open', 'story', 'strangely', 'compelling', 'one', 'just', 'how', 'easily', 'can', 'spiral', 'control', 'particular', 'tragedy', 'elements', 'cross-cultural', 'misunderstanding', 'class', 'gender', 'conflict', 'good', 'deal']",N/A

The cop who befriends Connely and slowly becomes psychotic due to a racist mentality is only a device to turn the lame story toward it's melodramatic resolution. It's certainly a watchable movie, even involving, Connely and Ben Kingsly as the compatriot in this legal dispute are excellent, but the platform plot too often sinks in the sand and gets lost in the fog.",2,HOUSE OF DREAD,1085184000,"05 22, 2004",2004,775,"['Dependent', 'unlikely', 'actions', 'several', 'characters', 'quot', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'quot', 'heavy-handed', 'utterly', 'earnest', 'excersize', 'contemporary', 'tragedy', 'understand', 'Jennifer', 'Connely', 'character', 'supposed', 'be', 'average', 'American', 'life', 'history', 'obscure', 'reason', 'being', 'involved', 'legal', 'dispute', 'ownership', 'modest', 'home', 'so', 'unlikely', 'rendered', 'shallow', 'cop', 'who', 'Connely', 'slowly', 'psychotic', 'due', 'racist', 'mentality', 'only', 'device', 'turn', 'lame', 'story', 'melodramatic', 'resolution', 'certainly', 'watchable', 'movie', 'even', 'involving', 'Connely', 'Ben', 'Kingsly', 'compatriot', 'legal', 'dispute', 'are', 'excellent', 'platform', 'plot', 'too', 'often', 'sand', 'lost', 'fog']",N/A
801295,A2NSDLHSG4YBHV,B0001DMVBC,Gwen A Orel,"[6, 7]","I would not have rented this on my own, but I'm glad I saw it-- the story draws you in at once, both with the Iranian family and the Colonel who hides his blue-collar work from the expat society in order to maintain his dignity, and the down and out young woman who hides her misery and the fact that her husband has left her when her mother calls.  She steps over a pile of bills to face the evictors, bewildered; he works a nightshift at a convenience store and sees the state auction notice.  Nothing good can come of this, you think-- and you're right.My sympathies were far more with the Iranian colonel than with Jennifer Connelly's character Kathy-- although she was mistakenly taxed, she blew it when she didn't follow up properly-- but what makes the movie particularly tough to take is that one feels pity and compassion for everyone, even her thuggish cop boyfriend who inadvertently escalates the situation to real tragedy by the end.There is some incredible acting throughout-- I had no idea Connelly was so much more than a pretty face-- Kingsley as Col. Behrani is amazing and Shorher Agdashloo, who plays his wife, is heartbreaking in her dignity, bewilderment and fumbling attempts at compassion, which in the end are somewhat misguided.The movie begins at the end, with Kathy at a scene of tragedy, and the whole story is a flashback... so there is somewhat less suspense than there might be.  Because of this it's hard to maintain any hope that things will turn out well, and overall this is a very depressing movie.  There is no real chance for redemption, only a wounded going forward, hopefully with more realization of what matters in life-- which is not a house, not even if it is the house your father built, but people.If you do get the DVD, take the commentary with a grain of salt.  Ben Kingsley is one of the world's finest character actors, but he is not an intellectual-- he latches onto a metaphor of Greek tragedy and then throughout the commentary he speaks of &quot;the gods&quot; this and &quot;the gods&quot; that until you want to slap him.  He says with a straight face (at least he doesn't sound like he's laughing) that he did no research into Iranian culture, which I infer to mean that others handed him research and taught him and he's forgotten it.  And his classic &quot;Shakespeare, that man was a genius&quot; on the interview had my mother and I nearly crying with laughter.  &quot;He's a bit of a luvvie,&quot; an Irish friend told me, and it's true.  The director too is prone to saying &quot;this was his/her finest moment&quot; about nearly every scene he likes.  But his remarks on other small details of the set-up or the scenery are worthwhile and interesting... it's just the love-in that's annoying.  (I was also put off by the way everybody, the director, the other actors, EVERYBODY, called him &quot;Sir Ben&quot; as if the &quot;Sir&quot; was part of his name!  Yes, it's his title, but most people with titles are called by their first names alone by their intimates-- and who is more intimate than your director and your costar?  It made &quot;Sir Ben&quot; look officious and pompous... I wonder if he signs his emails and valentines &quot;Sir Ben!&quot;  Get over it Kingsley!  Oi!)Don't watch this movie when you're feeling down, unless you find it comforting to watch people whose troubles are worse.

His performance is to me the 2nd best ever behind Billy Bob Thorton in the unforgettable Sling Blade.This gem is one of the most tragic ever and in the end, well, I was crying. I felt demolished and I was so sucked in by this masterpiece that I wanted to kill certain characters.This is the first movie that I've seen with Ben Kingsley and I can't belieeve how remarquable he is! Gene Hackman is nothing compared to this man. He put all of his emotions into this movie and made me feel for him. Hands done, this is the saddest and most tragic movie that I have EVER seen.Now for the plot. Kathy (Jennifer Collony) is a young lady living in California. She's got a nice house and a good life (or so we're led to believe). That soon changes though when her house gets reposessed because of not payed taxes. She is furious at these ""false?"" accusations. While she's trying to get it back, enter an Iraqui man, ex colonel and his wife and son. He buys the house at a very low price to make a huge profit. His family is living a wonderful and sweet life, and their tradtions are adorable.But, lil' Kathy here is still mad. And her wonderful body has attracted a police officer. And he's following here complete orders.What follows is a gem of a movie carried by Ben Kingsley's masterful perfomance. This is one of those rare movies that come along once in a decade.

801300,A2Y1SCM930PZI7,B0001DMVBC,Jabberwocky,"[3, 13]","I am one of the people who have both seen the film multiple times and read the book.There are some loose ends the film doesn't tie up. The film also can't really open up the characters to the audience in quite the same way as the novel for obvious reasons.1. If you think the characters in the movie are stupid and unsympathetic, they're worse in the book. Remember the scene where Kathy goes to the gas station to buy the liquor and the kerosene can? Well, she also held the gas attendant at gun point with Lester's gun, but eventually leaves the gasoline there, just like in the film.One thing I have to defend: Kathy is a recovering drug addict whose husband has just left her. Opening mail would be the last thing on anybody's mind at that time.While reading the novel, you actually feel more sorry for her than you do Behrani because he comes off more as a bully who was obviously one of the bad guys in Iran.2. In the last 25 minutes? We know Behrani's son gets killed and then Behrani goes home and kills his wife and himself. Well in the book, after Behrani comes home from the hospital, Kathy is there in the living room waiting and Behrani attacks her. He tries to kill her by choking her and actually lifting her off the ground with his hands around her throat; but instead of dying, she passes out. After he thinks Kathy is dead, he smothers his wife with a pillow then writes a will leaving the house to his daughter. Then he kills himself in the exact same way he does in the film.So as you see, the movie having Kathy coming back to the house and finding them dead is meant to be a lot more heart wrenching than having Kathy nearly choked to death by a man who blames her for his son's death.The ending of the movie? We know Lester ends up in jail calling his house, and Kathy ends up just smoking a cigarette denying the house belongs to her any longer.The ending of the book? Kathy has to recover in the hospital after being choked half to death, then learns everything that happened from her lawyer. Kathy is then arrested and charged with accessory to kidnapping and some other things. She ends up in jail just like Lester and pretends to be mute while becoming friends with a black woman who seems to be the leader of the women. It's evident that Kathy and Lester will never see each other again as Lester will probably be in jail many years for kidnapping and possibly manslaughter.",4,Let's clear up some loose ends.,1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2403,"['am', 'one', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'multiple', 'times', 'read', 'book.There', 'are', 'loose', 'film', ""n't"", 'tie', 'up', 'film', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'open', 'up', 'characters', 'audience', 'quite', 'same', 'way', 'novel', 'obvious', 'reasons.1', 'think', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'stupid', 'unsympathetic', ""'re"", 'worse', 'book', 'Remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Kathy', 'gas', 'station', 'buy', 'liquor', 'kerosene', 'can', 'Well', 'also', 'held', 'gas', 'attendant', 'gun', 'point', 'Lester', 'gun', 'eventually', 'gasoline', 'there', 'just', 'film.One', 'thing', 'have', 'defend', 'Kathy', 'recovering', 'drug', 'addict', 'husband', 'just', 'left', 'Opening', 'mail', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'thing', 'anybody', 'mind', 'time.While', 'reading', 'novel', 'actually', 'feel', 'more', 'sorry', 'do', 'Behrani', 'off', 'more', 'bully', 'who', 'was', 'obviously', 'one', 'bad', 'guys', 'Iran.2', 'last', '25', 'minutes', 'know', 'Behrani', 'son', 'killed', 'then', 'Behrani', 'home', 'kills', 'wife', 'Well', 'book', 'Behrani', 'home', 'hospital', 'Kathy', 'there', 'living', 'room', 'waiting', 'Behrani', 'kill', 'choking', 'actually', 'lifting', 'ground', 'hands', 'throat', 'instead', 'dying', 'out', 'Kathy', 'dead', 'wife', 'pillow', 'then', 'will', 'leaving', 'house', 'daughter', 'Then', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'film.So', 'see', 'movie', 'having', 'Kathy', 'coming', 'back', 'house', 'finding', 'dead', 'meant', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'heart', 'wrenching', 'having', 'Kathy', 'nearly', 'choked', 'death', 'man', 'who', 'son', 'death.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'know', 'Lester', 'up', 'jail', 'calling', 'house', 'Kathy', 'up', 'just', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'denying', 'house', 'longer.The', 'ending', 'book', 'Kathy', 'recover', 'hospital', 'being', 'choked', 'half', 'death', 'then', 'everything', 'happened', 'lawyer', 'Kathy', 'then', 'arrested', 'charged', 'accessory', 'kidnapping', 'other', 'things', 'up', 'jail', 'just', 'Lester', 'pretends', 'be', 'mute', 'becoming', 'friends', 'black', 'woman', 'who', 'be', 'leader', 'women', 'evident', 'Kathy', 'Lester', 'will', 'never', 'see', 'other', 'again', 'Lester', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'jail', 'many', 'years', 'kidnapping', 'possibly', 'manslaughter']",N/A

801303,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B0001DMVBC,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[6, 8]","Vadim Perelman, in his directorial debut, has created an extraordinarily powerful drama with &quot;The House Of Sand And Fog.&quot; Award-winning actors Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give truly great performances in this dark and tragic film of the American Dream turned nightmare. Shohreh Aghdashloo, as Kingelsy's wife Nadi, and Jonathan Ahdout as his teenage son Esmail, are also superb. And cinematographer Roger Deakins stunning photography sets the mood throughout the film.Persian immigrant, Massoud Amir Behrani, (Ben Kingsley), is a former colonel in the late, deposed Iranian Shah's air force. He is an intelligent, well educated man, who used to be respected in his native country as a person of position, power, and means. Behrani's former life, with all his efforts to build it, seems like it was constructed on a sea of shifting sand. He came to America with his wife, son, and daughter with limited funds, and has spent almost all of his money setting his family up in the manner to which they had been accustomed. One of the primary reasons for doing this was to marry his daughter to a member of their former social class. He is now reduced to working as a common laborer by day and a convenience store manager by night in order to provide for his family. His co-workers are men he would have given alms to in his native land. Angry and humiliated at how far he has fallen, Behrani decides to invest his remaining funds in a house that has been put up for auction at a Sheriff's Sale, because the owner had not paid property taxes. He wants to make improvements on the house and sell it at a large profit, which he hopes will enable him to provide his family with their former lifestyle, and restore some of his lost dignity.Kathy Niccolo is a disaster waiting to happen. She is a depressed, quietly self-destructive, recovering alcoholic and addict. Her house, in the California hills overlooking the Pacific, was bequeathed to her and her brother by her beloved father. It is all she has. She is adamant in her refusal to give-up her home because of a bureaucratic error. She was evicted for failing to pay a tax she never should have been charged in the first place. However, with her usual carelessness, she ignored a number of correspondences and warnings from the local tax board.Sheriff Lester Burdon, (Ron Eldard), delivers the eviction papers to Kathy. She confides in him and he becomes obsessed with helping her fight for justice. Lester finds himself falling in love with Kathy, although he is married with two children and much personal baggage of his own.The contested ownership of the house is the fulcrum of the intense plot. Two people compete with increasing desperation, for the title to one small bungalow, which has a different meaning for each of them. The tragedy lies in their inability to communicate and understand one another. Part of the movie's incredible power is the difficulty one has in deciding which party to side with, as both are at once sympathetic and worthy of censure.The film is absolutely riveting and the tension builds to a surprising climax. To say that &quot;The House of Sand and Fog&quot; is not upbeat entertainment is a major understatement. So, although I give the movie my highest recommendation, I do so with reservations. Prospective viewers should be cautioned that the grim intensity of this piece will stay with you for a very long time. Definitely not a films to see twice.JANA",5,A Dark Tale Of The American Dream Turned Nightmare,1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,3458,"['Vadim', 'Perelman', 'directorial', 'debut', 'created', 'extraordinarily', 'powerful', 'drama', 'quot', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog.', 'quot', 'Award-winning', 'actors', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'give', 'truly', 'great', 'performances', 'dark', 'tragic', 'film', 'American', 'Dream', 'turned', 'nightmare', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'Kingelsy', 'wife', 'Nadi', 'Jonathan', 'Ahdout', 'teenage', 'son', 'Esmail', 'are', 'also', 'superb', 'cinematographer', 'Roger', 'Deakins', 'stunning', 'photography', 'mood', 'film.Persian', 'immigrant', 'Massoud', 'Amir', 'Behrani', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'former', 'colonel', 'late', 'deposed', 'Iranian', 'Shah', 'air', 'force', 'intelligent', 'well', 'educated', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'respected', 'native', 'country', 'person', 'position', 'power', 'Behrani', 'former', 'life', 'efforts', 'build', 'was', 'constructed', 'sea', 'shifting', 'sand', 'came', 'America', 'wife', 'son', 'daughter', 'limited', 'funds', 'spent', 'almost', 'money', 'setting', 'family', 'up', 'manner', 'had', 'been', 'accustomed', 'One', 'primary', 'reasons', 'doing', 'was', 'marry', 'daughter', 'member', 'former', 'social', 'class', 'now', 'reduced', 'working', 'common', 'laborer', 'day', 'convenience', 'store', 'manager', 'night', 'order', 'provide', 'family', 'co-workers', 'are', 'men', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'alms', 'native', 'land', 'Angry', 'humiliated', 'how', 'far', 'fallen', 'Behrani', 'invest', 'remaining', 'funds', 'house', 'been', 'put', 'up', 'auction', 'Sheriff', 'Sale', 'owner', 'had', 'not', 'paid', 'property', 'taxes', 'make', 'improvements', 'house', 'sell', 'large', 'profit', 'will', 'enable', 'provide', 'family', 'former', 'lifestyle', 'restore', 'lost', 'dignity.Kathy', 'Niccolo', 'disaster', 'waiting', 'happen', 'depressed', 'quietly', 'self-destructive', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'addict', 'Her', 'house', 'California', 'hills', 'overlooking', 'Pacific', 'was', 'bequeathed', 'brother', 'beloved', 'father', 'adamant', 'refusal', 'give-up', 'home', 'bureaucratic', 'error', 'was', 'evicted', 'failing', 'pay', 'tax', 'never', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'charged', 'first', 'place', 'However', 'usual', 'carelessness', 'ignored', 'number', 'correspondences', 'warnings', 'local', 'tax', 'board.Sheriff', 'Lester', 'Burdon', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'eviction', 'papers', 'Kathy', 'obsessed', 'helping', 'fight', 'justice', 'Lester', 'falling', 'love', 'Kathy', 'married', 'two', 'children', 'much', 'personal', 'baggage', 'own.The', 'contested', 'ownership', 'house', 'fulcrum', 'intense', 'plot', 'Two', 'people', 'compete', 'increasing', 'desperation', 'title', 'one', 'small', 'bungalow', 'different', 'meaning', 'tragedy', 'inability', 'communicate', 'understand', 'one', 'Part', 'movie', 'incredible', 'power', 'difficulty', 'one', 'deciding', 'party', 'side', 'are', 'once', 'sympathetic', 'worthy', 'censure.The', 'film', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'tension', 'surprising', 'climax', 'say', 'quot', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'quot', 'not', 'upbeat', 'entertainment', 'major', 'understatement', 'So', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation', 'do', 'so', 'reservations', 'Prospective', 'viewers', 'should', 'be', 'cautioned', 'grim', 'intensity', 'piece', 'will', 'stay', 'very', 'long', 'time', 'Definitely', 'not', 'films', 'see', 'twice.JANA']",N/A

If this were a review of a book, I'd mercilessly skewer it for its ending - and I do not plan on reading the novel for that reason. But until the flick's illogical and unreasonable end game, the movie shone. The direction is deft, the acting is other-worldly, and even the plot works, pitting two kindred, yet opposite people against one another. Certainly each character is remarkably complex and interesting.Yet. The ending. So frustrating. So rare are the books and movies nowadays that resolve realistically, without the spilling of blood. But somehow violence has crept to the center of American story-telling. I understand; violent confrontation raises the stakes of the story. When it appears that losing a conflict results in death...well, it makes the conflict more important. However, putting violence into a conflict is a cheap way of creating tension, especially if it's not necessary. This movie did not need its violent ending to be powerful. In fact, I'd say the opposite. The stakes were high enough - the characters were fighting over a house, a way of life, the interpretation of the American Dream, all qualities that are more important than life or death.But can you blame anyone involved with this movie for its ending?

Masterful performances are turned in by the entire cast, and from that perspective it is an exceedingly well done movie.However, this one does drag at points, especially the beginning.

Things are not as they appear.  The preview for ""House of Sand and Fog"" gives us what we need to know to go into the movie.  We learn that Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) has been evicted from her house and that Behrani (Ben Kingsley) was able to buy it a very cheap rate because it was put up for auction by the city.  We learn that Kathy's home should not have been put up for auction and that the city made a mistake.  We learn that there is going to be something of a confrontation between Kathy and Behrani.  That's all we need to know to set up the movie, but as Behrani said, ""things are not as they appear.""The movie we see from the preview is simplistic.  The cast is excellent, but we have no clue about the depth that this movie has in its performances and in the story itself.  The preview suggests that Kingsley will be the bad guy, but the relationships are much more complex than that and when we learn more about Behrani and his situation and his family, it is impossible to view him as a villain, nor do I think he is intended to be so.  The entire story centers around the house and the desire to own this house, Kathy for herself and her ties to her family, and Behrani for his own.  Things are not as they appear.Considering the fact that this is a film by a first time director, I was astounded by how good it is.  I didn't have very strong expectations when I started watching it, but I was stunned by its power and heart and the tragedy implicit in ""House of Sand and Fog"".  The movie also features a heartbreaking supporting performance by Shohreh Adghashloo as Behrani's wife Nadi.I do not want to praise this movie too highly lest I raise expectations to a level that cannot be met.

To say that Sir Ben overacts might be too strong, but he sure does emote and he is very intense, yes, very intense. His face can be very grim and fierce at times.Connelly plays a self-indulgent brat who because of addiction issues didn't keep track of the county mail that was coming to her warning her of repossession. Ben wants to flip the house and get something better. The house has a beautiful view of the sea, reminding Ben, his wife and teenage son of the beautiful view of the Caspian Sea they had before they were forced to flee Iran.A bent deputy sheriff, who is a bigot, a self-indulgent boy-man, falls for Jennifer and comes to her aid, threatening Ben with deportation even though he's an American citizen. He's the one who precipitates the tragedy.This drama is told in very realistic terms; the acting is fine, and it will have an impact upon you as you view it. The story is set up almost like a Greek tragedy; there's an inevitability about the situation and the working out of the plot.

The most deserving of that honor, Ben Kingsley, is right here in THE HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG, a story of three lives that collide like a 3-way train wreck.Kingsley is Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the service of the Iranian Shah. Forced to flee the country after the fall of the monarch, Behrani now works two jobs - convenience store clerk by night and road maintenance worker by day - to try and stem the slow drain of his savings being spent on the expensive lifestyle that his wife Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo) is used to. Perusing the paper, he sees an moneymaking opportunity in the public auction of a house confiscated by the county to pay back taxes. Massoud intends to buy the place on the cheap, fix it up, and sell it at the going market rate. Behrani is a proud man determined to regain his self-respect and the Good Life for his family. By maintaining a facade of affluence, he's already managed to marry his daughter off to another wealthy and respectable Iranian emigre. Now, he needs to put his son Esmail (Jonathan Ahdout) through college.Unfortunately, the home is owned by Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), who inherited it from her father eight months previous. Kathy is a recovering alcoholic, who failed to deal with the county bureaucracy when she had the chance, and now it's too late to stop the sale. She's evicted, has nowhere to go, no friends, no nearby family, no money, and is truly on the edge.Into this volatile mix comes Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), who's the police deputy assigned the uncomfortable task of tossing Nicolo into the street. Burdened by a marriage gone bad, Lester is seduced by Kathy's beauty and vulnerability, and he becomes her champion to the exclusion of common sense and professionalism. (With men, what else is new?)Burdon aside, who's basically a fool guided by his gonads, the viewer will have to decide whom to back - Massoud or Kathy - because this intelligently scripted film doesn't favor one over the other even as the confrontation escalates beyond all bounds of rationality. There's no Hero or Villain. But for good fortune and good toilet training, you or I could be in either position.In emotional intensity, even Sean Penn's performance in MYSTIC RIVER can't match Kingsley's here. There's a scene towards the end in a local hospital that'll knock your socks off, and for which alone Kingsley deserves Best Actor.HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is one of the very best films of 2003, and deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.",5,Lives of desperation collide,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",2004,2629,"['Penn', 'Crowe', 'Murray', 'Hopkins', 'rest', 'might', 'think', 'deserve', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', '2003', 'film', 'year', 'forget', 'most', 'deserving', 'honor', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'right', 'here', 'THE', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'story', 'three', 'lives', 'collide', '3-way', 'train', 'wreck.Kingsley', 'Massoud', 'Amir', 'Behrani', 'former', 'colonel', 'service', 'Iranian', 'Shah', 'Forced', 'flee', 'country', 'fall', 'monarch', 'Behrani', 'now', 'two', 'jobs', 'convenience', 'store', 'clerk', 'night', 'road', 'maintenance', 'worker', 'day', 'try', 'stem', 'slow', 'drain', 'savings', 'being', 'spent', 'expensive', 'lifestyle', 'wife', 'Nadi', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'used', 'Perusing', 'paper', 'moneymaking', 'opportunity', 'public', 'auction', 'house', 'confiscated', 'county', 'pay', 'back', 'taxes', 'Massoud', 'buy', 'place', 'cheap', 'fix', 'up', 'sell', 'going', 'market', 'rate', 'Behrani', 'proud', 'man', 'determined', 'regain', 'self-respect', 'Good', 'Life', 'family', 'maintaining', 'facade', 'affluence', 'already', 'managed', 'marry', 'daughter', 'wealthy', 'respectable', 'Iranian', 'emigre', 'Now', 'put', 'son', 'Esmail', 'Jonathan', 'Ahdout', 'college.Unfortunately', 'home', 'owned', 'Kathy', 'Nicolo', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'who', 'inherited', 'father', 'eight', 'months', 'previous', 'Kathy', 'recovering', 'alcoholic', 'who', 'failed', 'deal', 'county', 'bureaucracy', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'now', 'too', 'late', 'stop', 'sale', 'evicted', 'nowhere', 'go', 'friends', 'nearby', 'family', 'money', 'truly', 'edge.Into', 'volatile', 'mix', 'Lester', 'Burdon', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'who', 'police', 'deputy', 'assigned', 'uncomfortable', 'task', 'tossing', 'Nicolo', 'street', 'Burdened', 'marriage', 'gone', 'bad', 'Lester', 'seduced', 'Kathy', 'beauty', 'vulnerability', 'champion', 'exclusion', 'common', 'sense', 'professionalism', 'men', 'what', 'else', 'new', 'Burdon', 'aside', 'who', 'basically', 'fool', 'guided', 'gonads', 'viewer', 'will', 'have', 'decide', 'whom', 'back', 'Massoud', 'Kathy', 'intelligently', 'scripted', 'film', ""n't"", 'favor', 'one', 'other', 'even', 'confrontation', 'bounds', 'rationality', 'Hero', 'Villain', 'good', 'fortune', 'good', 'toilet', 'training', 'could', 'be', 'position.In', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'even', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'performance', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'ca', ""n't"", 'match', 'Kingsley', 'here', 'scene', 'end', 'local', 'hospital', ""'ll"", 'knock', 'socks', 'off', 'alone', 'Kingsley', 'Best', 'Actor.HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'films', '2003', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Picture']",N/A

It's as if the writer didn't have a clue how to end his story, so he just threw in a bunch of dead-end tragic events as a cheap (but seemingly ""deep"") way to wrap these characters up. Depressing stories don't always equal depth. Not to say the film doesn't look good. But you can professionally and slickly package a turd - but it's still a turd.",1,Jennifer says: This oughtta get me more jobs!,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",2004,870,"['One', 'supposedly', 'deep', 'artistic', 'movies', 'play', 'critics', 'get', 'buzz', 'being', 'intellectual', 'mainstream', 'movie', 'actor', 'would', 'love', 'be', 'actor', 'who', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'only', 'reason', 'why', 'think', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'would', 'do', 'film', 'advertisement', 'skills', 'others', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'movies', 'mess', 'film', 'badly', 'written', 'horribly', 'plotted', 'depressing', 'sake', 'being', 'depressing', 'writer', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'how', 'end', 'story', 'just', 'threw', 'bunch', 'dead-end', 'tragic', 'events', 'cheap', 'seemingly', 'deep', 'way', 'wrap', 'characters', 'up', 'Depressing', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'equal', 'depth', 'Not', 'say', 'film', ""n't"", 'look', 'good', 'can', 'professionally', 'slickly', 'package', 'turd', 'still', 'turd']",N/A

801322,A34D4KCP94ACJZ,B0001DMVBC,K. Driscoll,"[9, 11]","House of Sand and Fog is a hopeless but convincing tragedy about contested houses and broken pasts. It is morbid and profound enough to keep the riff raff away while also being flat enough to stray from any mainstream. I enjoyed the film for the same reasons critics probably enjoyed it. The film is carried by it's performances first and foremost and almost entirely. One of the more educated knocks on House of Sand and Fog is that the book is simply not really that transferrable toward the movie medium. I never read the book but the film and story stand enough to fuel three of the better performances of that year and also the greatest ensemble considering it's cost.First is Ben Kingsley who plays Colonel Berani, a man who was forced to flee Iran during it's revolution. He sees a similar home in San Franscisco with regards to it's view (in Iran his home oversaw the Caspian Sea beautifully). This new home was recently repossessed from Kathy, played by the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connelly. I genuinely want Connelley to show her range in the future but House of Sand and Fog is not such an environment. Here, Jennifer plays a women ruined by Alcoholism and being ditched by her husband. She then sparks up an affair with a married police officer named Lester, played by Ron Eldred, and the undermining to throw Berani out of the house begins.First time Director Vadim Perleman takes a subtle approach in the differences and similarities between the film's main characters. It was enough to make me walk away from the film wanting more but as if by osmosis the film won me over in perspective only days later. Watching the three main characters tangled in their flaws is enough to keep the film compelling. Berani is too proud and deaf to women, Kathy is too eager and manipulative and Lester is too idealistic and blinded by love. They are all ignorant to one another and completely void of empathy. Nadi is Berani's wife and she is played by the outstanding Shohreh Aghdashloo. Nadi is one of the only really likeable characters, because she is also the only one who sees the other's sides, but she is restrained by her submissiveness and her lack of English. Though heavy handed enough to obtain a brooding feeling that tragedy is inevitable, watching these characters fall is worth the wait if you appreciate this sort of film.Kingsly proves his versatility once again and upstages Connelly in that regard by a long shot. Connelly really just invokes the roles she's been celebrated for before this movie, although she is still quite effective and it revisits her type-casts a bit deeper. It is Aghdashloo that truely stands out and I viewed this film and her performance after the hype with some degree of suspicion. She is excellent.Overall, House of Sand and Fog is a downer. It wasn't as good as I hoped, given both the indie hype prior to it's release and the mainstream hype during and after it's release, but it was still pretty good. The cast alone makes the film worth watching but I would still imagine we will see more from Perleman in the future as well.",3,Mostly Good for It's Performances,1178841600,"05 11, 2007",2007,3088,"['House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'hopeless', 'convincing', 'tragedy', 'contested', 'houses', 'broken', 'pasts', 'morbid', 'profound', 'enough', 'keep', 'riff', 'away', 'also', 'being', 'flat', 'enough', 'stray', 'mainstream', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'same', 'reasons', 'critics', 'probably', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'carried', 'performances', 'first', 'foremost', 'almost', 'entirely', 'One', 'more', 'educated', 'knocks', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'book', 'simply', 'not', 'really', 'transferrable', 'movie', 'medium', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'film', 'story', 'stand', 'enough', 'fuel', 'three', 'better', 'performances', 'year', 'also', 'greatest', 'ensemble', 'considering', 'cost.First', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'Colonel', 'Berani', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'flee', 'Iran', 'revolution', 'similar', 'home', 'San', 'Franscisco', 'regards', 'view', 'Iran', 'home', 'oversaw', 'Caspian', 'Sea', 'beautifully', 'new', 'home', 'was', 'recently', 'repossessed', 'Kathy', 'played', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'genuinely', 'want', 'Connelley', 'show', 'range', 'future', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'not', 'such', 'environment', 'Here', 'Jennifer', 'women', 'ruined', 'Alcoholism', 'being', 'ditched', 'husband', 'then', 'up', 'affair', 'married', 'police', 'officer', 'named', 'Lester', 'played', 'Ron', 'Eldred', 'undermining', 'throw', 'Berani', 'house', 'begins.First', 'time', 'Director', 'Vadim', 'Perleman', 'subtle', 'approach', 'differences', 'similarities', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'walk', 'away', 'film', 'wanting', 'more', 'osmosis', 'film', 'won', 'over', 'perspective', 'only', 'days', 'later', 'Watching', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'tangled', 'flaws', 'enough', 'keep', 'film', 'compelling', 'Berani', 'too', 'proud', 'deaf', 'women', 'Kathy', 'too', 'eager', 'manipulative', 'Lester', 'too', 'idealistic', 'blinded', 'love', 'are', 'ignorant', 'one', 'completely', 'void', 'empathy', 'Nadi', 'Berani', 'wife', 'played', 'outstanding', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'Nadi', 'one', 'only', 'really', 'likeable', 'characters', 'also', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'other', 'sides', 'restrained', 'submissiveness', 'lack', 'English', 'Though', 'heavy', 'handed', 'enough', 'obtain', 'brooding', 'feeling', 'tragedy', 'inevitable', 'watching', 'characters', 'fall', 'wait', 'appreciate', 'sort', 'film.Kingsly', 'versatility', 'once', 'again', 'Connelly', 'regard', 'long', 'shot', 'Connelly', 'really', 'just', 'invokes', 'roles', 'been', 'celebrated', 'movie', 'still', 'quite', 'effective', 'type-casts', 'bit', 'deeper', 'Aghdashloo', 'truely', 'out', 'viewed', 'film', 'performance', 'hype', 'degree', 'suspicion', 'excellent.Overall', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'downer', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'hoped', 'given', 'indie', 'hype', 'prior', 'release', 'mainstream', 'hype', 'release', 'was', 'still', 'pretty', 'good', 'cast', 'alone', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'still', 'imagine', 'will', 'see', 'more', 'Perleman', 'future', 'well']",N/A

Why? You know the drill. Movies are never as good as the good books they portray.I mean...almost never. What worried me about a movie adaptation of this book is that the story line has an amazingly subtle forward motion and tension. Long and short: the movie captured it brilliantly.Other reviewrs have summed up the plot, so I will defer to them. The only other new 'blurb' that I can offer in this review is that this movie follows much the same formula as Shakespeare's dramas (if you can call it a formula; maybe 'model' is a better word). None of the characters here are evil, sinister, or lacking of the viewers sympathy. All, however, have a tragic flaw, be it obsession with revenge, inabililty to adjust to a 'lesser' lifestyle, of the poor and rash judgment of sommeone newly in love after a 'dry spell'. Keeping with the Shakespeare 'model', these tragic flaws build up into a tense web, untill a climax is reached that will set your heart reverberating. But, like Shakespeare, the 'dark' ending is so engrossing that it is tolerable (whereas a lesser cast and crew would've made it seem pouty).Simply put, well done.

801329,A2T049UQONS0OY,B0001DMVBC,Larry VanDeSande,"[1, 4]","Here's a fine drama full of good acting but long on anguish and dreariness. Taken from the book of the same name, the story revolves around a dispute about a repossessed home sold to an immigrant family headed by a strong father figure (Ben Kingsley). The homeowner, sexpot turned actress Jennifer Connelley, is wrongfully evicted and seeks to get back her property.The story details her meandering life in eviction and the Greek tragedy of her life -- husband left her, father worked all his life for the home she lost, new boyfriend betrays wife and children to be with her. Meanwhile, the new owner -- an expatriate military leader in the Shah of Iran's regime -- seeks to return to some of the good life his family led in their homeland, in part by getting the house, fixing it up and selling it for a big profit.Unfortunately, no one in this film gets what they want. In fact, they all get more trouble than they want. If their lives were tragic before they met this house of sand and fog, they began to live in utter despair afterward. It should instead be called the house of broken dreams, for its residents have their hopes and lives shattered by involvement with it.The production team interspersed scenes of rapid sky, fog, cloud and sea movement during intervening moments of the drama. This adds to the aura of despair, which is overwhelming during the film's 125 minutes. There is a singular lack of hope and optimism in this movie that will send a lot of viewers home satisfied but unfulfilled.Other fine dramas find a way to send viewers home without this desultory pessimism. One of the finest negative affect dramas ever, 1980's ""Ordinary People"", found a way to locate optimism at the end even after the mother had left home. Even ""The Perfect Storm"" found a way to assuage the pain of its stars all perishing at sea with a memorial service for them.

801330,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0001DMVBC,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","In one of the special features on the DVD of &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; Sir Ben Kingsley compares this tragedy to those of Shakespeare, and the comparison is apt.  This is not to suggest that the dialogue of this 2003 film reaches the level of such brilliant writing, but that this is a tragedy that reaches a depth comparable to some of the tales of the Bard.  The tone is set from the start, as Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly) watches ambulances leave the house that is at the center of this story.  Without any more information than that, we know that what is coming is going to be bad.  Very bad.The situation is that Kathy's husband has been gone for months, although she makes up stories about him being asleep or out of town when her mother calls.  She lives in a split-level home that sort of has a view of the shore.  A recovering alcoholic, she has failed to pay taxes owed on a business that was not her own and she has been ignoring warnings from the country.  Consequently she is evicted from her home, which is put up for auction.  The house is quickly bought by Massoud Amir Behrani (Kingsley), an Iranian immigrant who was once a colonel in the Air Force of the Shah.  He has been working two menial jobs to keep his family living in some semblance of the luxury they enjoyed in Iran and he sees this house as an great opportunity, thinking that he can sell it for three or four times what he paid at auction.  Meanwhile, Kathy goes to a lawyer (Frances Fisher) to get her house back.  It appears the county made a mistake in acting so hastily, but already Behrani is putting up a Widow's Walk on HER house.The house is important to both Kathy and Behrani, and one of the major strengths of this film by director Vadim Perelman is that we see both sides of the story, and how each of the protagonists is both right and wrong.  The wild card in this story turns out to be Deputy Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), who helps Kathy when he has to evict her from her house and who ends up becoming involved with her despite the fact he is married and has two kids.  He seems to be a guardian angel for Kathy, who is a recovering alcoholic, and certainly Burdon keeps her from falling too far too fast.  But he soon loses his gift for helping her.The true angle in the film is Behrani's wife, Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo), who has trouble speaking English but who can respond with great empathy to the plight of Kathy, who continues to unravel as fate toys with her life.  The pivotal point in this film comes when we think that Kathy is about to go and do something bad, and she does.  But it is not what we thought and it changes everything in an expected way.  If there is a point where &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; becomes lyrical it is when the Behranis explain to their son, Esmail (Jonathan Ahdout), about the broken woman in their home.  Yet the story moves towards tragedy and small decisions have fatal consequences.  The fact that nobody wants any of this to happen only heightens the tragedy.Kingsley is a consummate actor and this well could be his finest performance.  Given what I have seen this week with him in this film and Diane Keaton in &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; I am convinced that once you win an Oscar you might get nominated but you can pretty much forget winning even when you do something better.  Since Connelly &quot;just&quot; won an Oscar that might explain why she was overlooked for a nomination while Aghdshloo is superb as well, often without speaking (or speaking in Farsai).

801331,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B0001DMVBC,Lawyeraau,"[6, 6]","This is an excellent film, which is based upon the best selling book of the same name. It is a brilliantly acted story of two people whose destinies become intertwined  through a simple twist of fate. It is the story of what happens to them and to those who love them, when their respective worlds collide in a climactic and tragic way.It is the story of Colonel Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a formerly wealthy Iranian, who had thrived under the regime of the Shah, only to lose everything during his country's revolution. Now, he and his family find themselves undergoing the immigrant experience in America, working to maintain appearances among their fellow exiles and finding the going hard. Working long hours at menial jobs, Colonel Behrani longs to be a master of the universe again.It is also the story of Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), a woman with some serious issues. She is a sad and pathetic bottom feeder, a loser who has squandered her life. Due to a bureaucratic snafu over taxes, Kathy loses that which has kept her somewhat anchored and which she holds near and dear: the house in which she lives, as it is a house that she inherited from her father. When she is summarily evicted from it, she meets Sheriff Lester Burden (Ron Eldard), a married man with children, who is smitten by her. His obsession with her would lead him down a path from which there would be no return.When Colonel Behrani's quest for the American Dream finds him with an opportunity to buy a house at a bargain basement price at a county auction, he plunks down the remainder of his family's life savings. At the time of purchase, he knows nothing of the circumstances of the county's possession of that house, Kathy's house. When the Behranis move in, Colonel Behrani's head is filled with dreams of selling the house at a large profit, becoming a real estate speculator, and leading his family back to its former glory and place in society. He truly believes that America is the land of opportunity. He believes in the American Dream.Kathy, on the other hand, has done nothing with the opportunities afforded her. She has simply squandered them by marrying the wrong man, engaging in substance abuse, living a marginal existence by cleaning houses, and proving herself to be an untrustworthy and amoral person with little regard for others. Her life is the antithesis of the American Dream. Still, she has her father's house, and when she loses it due to a bureaucratic error, the bottom totally falls out of her life. For now, she truly has nothing. Like a dog with a bone, she refuses to let the issue go and will stop at nothing to get her house back from the Behranis, whom she views as greedy usurpers. Her view of the situation is supported by Sheriff Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), who becomes embroiled in Kathy's struggle and takes it to a level that not even Kathy could have anticipated.As the actors beguilingly lead the viewer to the film's climactic ending, the viewer will be riveted to the screen by this beautifully acted, well crafted film. Ben Kinsgley is outstanding as the proud Colonel Behrani who longs for that which he once had. Mr. Kingsley perfectly captures the essence of the character. Ben Kingsley is Colonel Behrani, giving a pitch perfect performance that is positively brilliant and won him as Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.Jennifer Connelly gives a fine performance as the lackadaisical, very primal Kathy Nicolo, though she seems too pretty and healthy looking, given her character's substance abusing past. Kathy is someone who ruins almost everything that she touches without meaning to do so, as she is a person totally lacking in self-control. Hers is an inherently unlikable character, as she is the catalyst around whom the tragic events unfold. They unfold, however, in a way that she never intended.  Jennifer Connelly infuses Kathy with a listlessness that is perfect.Ron Eldard is rather likable as the conflicted Sheriff Burdon, a tightly wound, unhappy man. His passion for Kathy causes him to begin to lose his self-control, and he begins a downward spiral that ends in a personal meltdown. The only problem is that Ron Eldard makes Sheriff Burden a much more likable character  in the film than he was in the book, infusing him with a more obvious moral compass. I actually liked Sheriff Burdon in the film, though I liked his character a lot less in the book.  Kudos also go to first time actor Jonathan Adbout for his relaxed and natural performance as the Behrani's only son.The role of Nadi Behrani, the Colonel's wife, is stunningly played by beautiful Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, who delivers a one-two punch performance that takes one's breath away. If Ben Kingsley is the heart of this film, Ms. Aghdashloo is its soul. Hers is a poignant and heartbreaking performance full of passion and pathos, as Nadi is a character who is struggling to adjust to her new life in a new country and finding the going hard. Hers is a difficult role, as it requires that she speak in a  combination of Farsi and broken English influenced by the grammatical cadence of Nadi's native language. Yet, one never mistakes the meaning of what she is saying. One realizes that Nadi is a person who is simply caught in the cross hairs of her husbands determination to regain his former prestige. Ms. Aghdashloo's performance makes the character of Nadi a stronger presence than she was in the book.This modern day Greek tragedy, with its layers of moral and cultural complexities, is a spellbinding and suspenseful film that is a pretty faithful adaptation of a beautifully written book. Well directed by Vadim Perelman, it is a rich and powerful film of the first order.",5,A MODERN DAY GREEK TRAGEDY...,1085961600,"05 31, 2004",2004,5728,"['excellent', 'film', 'based', 'best',

He was wealthy in Iran and he and his family escaped with their lives.  They've been in America a few years and the wealth they formerly had is fast being depleted.  Behrani works at two jobs - a laborer by day and a convenience store clerk by night.  He saves his money and buys a house at auction.  He thinks his troubles are over.  But they are just beginning.Jennifer Connolly is cast as Kathy, the young woman was evicted from the house that Behrani buys. She's been abandoned by her husband, works cleaning houses for a living, and just can't seem to keep her life together.  She's also a former drug addict who is easily tempted by alcohol.  Devastated by the eviction, she vows to get her house back.  This is a perfect formula for trouble.The acting is perfect.  And the direction and cinematography are excellent.  Some of the shots were able to show in a few seconds what it took pages and pages to bring out in the book.  It's an ultimately sad story and I remember how upset I was while reading the book.  But watching the film, I actually wept.  There's something about the media of film that could do that.  The book had more detail and background.

Jerome ""jamdown""","[5, 8]","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and completely identified with the Iranian immigrant family who were pursuing their American dream, while longing for what they had been forced to flee from in their native land.  As an immigrant myself, I understand the desire to own your own home and do well, even while holding on fiercely to one's cultural background.I did not identify at all with the careless female who failed to aggressively ensure that her home was securely in her possession, and who turned around and tried to blame all her problems on the immigrant family who had worked hard to save money to buy her auctioned home.  Apparently, Ms. Connelly's character did not work, was an alcoholic, had no friends, and was generally a layabout.  It just struck me that she was lucky enough to inherit the home from a hardworking father, but failed to take any actions to ensure that she would continue to own this home.  I could not understand why she blamed the immigrant family who legally came into possession of her home, and engaged in what I deem to be harassment against them, instead of suing the county for what she believed was an illegal tax.Anyways, this movie will move you to tears with its all around brilliant and believable performances - especially at its dramatic and painful conclusion.Well done!!

I was curious, and hopeful, that the power of the book could be translated to the screen.One of the most formidable, often impossible, jobs for a film is to fill the actors' lines with the same intensity of emotions and complexity that the author does so beautifully. Certainly, Ben Kinsley is the perfect actor to portray the former Iranian officer, Behrani, and his performance is of the award-winning caliber we have come to expect. But I thought Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) much too beautiful, vulnerable and likeable for the role of a truly desperate and self-centered woman.Kathy's character is pivotal: it is she who starts the chain of events and she who attracts a policeman, the lost Lester Burdon, who has no sense of self and a need to prove his manhood. It is also critical that Kathy not become emotionally involved with the General, that she remain unmoved by his actions and incapable of any sympathy for him, and vice versa. That the lovers (Kathy and Lester) get so distracted by their affair and Kathy's alcoholism adds to the inevitability of the drama. Kathy and Behrani are essentially two powerful, strong-willed opponents on a collision course with fate. That said, the actress performs admirably in a plot that becomes an emotional quagmire, in the hands of the screenwriter.Discussing the movie with a friend who didn't read the book, I found that she had trouble following the chain of events and some confusion with the storyline and internal motivation of the characters. I suggested she read the book. The DVD offers an excellent impression of some of the difficulties facing immigrants from foreign countries, including alternative lifestyles and value systems; the differences in language, attitudes and behavior are significant and can provoke the kind of situation this story addresses.Visually, the movie is excellent, the cinematography brooding and somber.

801337,A1PICWXVZHP61T,B0001DMVBC,"Maeve of Tara ""Avid Reader""","[9, 12]","There are major issues in the story-line I don't agree with, am not sure if these are due to Andre Dubus' (the novelist) concepts (I've not read the novel but am ordering it now, online), or have the screen-writers, due to production needs, taken a short-cut and thus harmed the Jennifer Connelly (beautiful Kathy Nicolo, a deeply depressed alcoholic unable to function in the real world) and Ben Kingsley (Massoud Amir Behrani, former Air Force colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah), characters... but more about this, later. Oh, I better pause for a minute and pay homage to actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, who turns in an excellent performance as the Colonel's warm-hearted and genteel, Iranian wife.Briefly: Dubus tells this riveting tale from the divergent viewpoints of the two adversaries, portrayed by ""Behrani"" and ""Kathy."" To each of them, the house means more than a conventional roof over their heads. For the colonel, it's his way out from his financial troubles, make a quick substantial profit by buying something cheaply and sell it dearly; but for Kathy, a reminder of a sunnier past.Despite some of my disagreements, fact is, HOUSE OF SAND AND FOG is a ""MUST SEE"" cautionary tale for several reasons. Especially  if the authorities come after you claiming you owe taxes you DO NOT OWE (especially if you are a home owner, and even more especially if you own your home free and clear, which makes it a pure, ready-to-be-picked asset they can grasp away from you in one fell swoop), and you reply to them explaining your stand .... don't you ever be such a fool as to ignore their follow-up letters! No matter how down and under you are, no matter if your husband has left you and you are in the belly of the beast grappling with alcoholism and depression... DO NOT IGNORE THE GOVERNMENT (State or Federal) if it, rightly or wrongly, decides you owe taxes!The house that is the center of this unfolding drama, is a modest, aging bungalow on a hilltop with a breathtaking view (superb cinematography!). Kathy has inherited this house from her father, along with her brother. Also, it's her safe haven on the turbulent sea of her life. She is battling alcoholism and depression on her own, without going  around sharing her problems. Her husband has left her, and she has not told anyone, not even her mother or brother.Then one morning she steps out of the shower to answer a knock on her door, cloaked in nothing but sleepy eyes and a bath robe, and her already precarious mental existence comes crashing down around her. Within hours she is evicted from her house which is to be auctioned the very next day in a county tax sale. Yes the authorities are not justified because she has proven to them that she does not owe the tax. Alas, though, she has done wrong, too: she's taken it for granted that her reply to them was read and agreed upon....At first, she seems to have found a guardian angel, Deputy Lester  Burdon --- a married man with two children. Although clearly taken in by her beauty, he is also a genuinely kind man, he makes her admit the reality of her situation, secures legal counsel for her and helps her find a place to stay, but his faith in the system (and her lawyer's view of her just stand) clash with the will of proud ex-Colonel Behrani (Ben Kingsley) who fled his homeland with his family when the Shah was deposed and who has struggled secretly in San Francisco, performing low-paying, odd and hard jobs (for a man his age and background) to keep up a facade of being well-off until his daughter secures a good marriage. His character is perfectly drawn, an authentic, old-fashioned proud patriarch. He has poured his remaining life savings into buying Kathy's house, at a TREMENDOUS bargain, planning to resell it a substantial mark-up. Thus he refuses to sell it back at the price he bought it for, when Kathy's lawyer informs him the county made a bureaucratic error.He is not just proud, but too stubborn, until... until he has his moment of epiphany, but ... is it too late? I disagreed yet empathized with his senseless pride and ""my way or no way"" attitude, all the way through --- after all he is a truthfully designed product of his times and culture, but the character of Kathy angered me a few times. On the one hand, she can't tell the truth to her brother, dissolves in helpless tears during the only phone conversation she has with him (TELL HIM THE TRUTH! I kept screaming, he is the co-owner, he's got a right to know!) yet on the other, she tells her lawyer, who is totally on her side, to go f... herself.  Yes, Kathy's character is full of annoying contradictions. So I gotta see who's the culprit here, the novelist or screen-writers. Nevertheless, she is a consummate actress.And you, dear Reader, will not regret having purchased this DVD.",5,"I rate this film a  ""MUST SEE!""",1098576000,"10 24, 2004",2004,4813,"['are', 'major', 'issues', 'story-line', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'are', 'due', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'novelist', 'concepts', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'am', 'ordering', 'now', 'online', 'have', 'screen-writers', 'due', 'production', 'needs', 'taken', 'short-cut', 'thus', 'harmed', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'beautiful', 'Kathy', 'Nicolo', 'deeply', 'depressed', 'alcoholic', 'unable', 'function', 'real', 'world', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Massoud', 'Amir', 'Behrani', 'former', 'Air', 'Force', 'colonel', 'Iranian', 'military', 'Shah', 'characters', 'more', 'later', 'Oh', 'better', 'pause', 'minute', 'pay', 'homage', 'actress', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'who', 'excellent', 'performance', 'Colonel', 'warm-hearted', 'genteel', 'Iranian', 'wife.Briefly', 'Dubus', 'riveting', 'tale', 'divergent', 'viewpoints', 'two', 'adversaries', 'portrayed', 'Behrani', 'Kathy', 'house', 'more', 'conventional', 'roof', 'heads', 'colonel', 'way', 'financial', 'troubles', 'make', 'quick', 'substantial', 'profit', 'buying', 'something', 'cheaply', 'sell', 'dearly', 'Kathy', 'reminder', 'sunnier', 'past.Despite', 'disagreements', 'fact', 'HOUSE', 'OF', 'SAND', 'AND', 'FOG', 'MUST', 'SEE', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'several', 'reasons', 'Especially', 'authorities', 'come', 'claiming', 'owe', 'taxes', 'DO', 'NOT', 'OWE', 'especially', 'are', 'home', 'owner', 'even', 'more', 'especially', 'own', 'home', 'free', 'clear', 'pure', 'ready-to-be-picked', 'asset', 'can', 'grasp', 'away', 'one', 'fell', 'swoop', 'reply', 'explaining', 'stand', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'be', 'such', 'fool', 'ignore', 'follow-up', 'letters', 'matter', 'how', 'down', 'are', 'matter', 'husband', 'left', 'are', 'belly', 'beast', 'grappling', 'alcoholism', 'depression', 'DO', 'NOT', 'IGNORE', 'THE', 'GOVERNMENT', 'State', 'Federal', 'rightly', 'wrongly', 'owe', 'taxes', 'house', 'center', 'unfolding', 'drama', 'modest', 'aging', 'bungalow', 'hilltop', 'breathtaking', 'view', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'Kathy', 'inherited', 'house', 'father', 'brother', 'Also', 'safe', 'haven', 'turbulent', 'sea', 'life', 'battling', 'alcoholism', 'depression', 'own', 'going', 'sharing', 'problems', 'husband', 'left', 'not', 'told', 'anyone', 'not', 'even', 'mother', 'brother.Then', 'one', 'morning', 'shower', 'answer', 'knock', 'door', 'cloaked', 'nothing', 'sleepy', 'eyes', 'bath', 'robe', 'already', 'precarious', 'mental', 'existence', 'crashing', 'down', 'Within', 'hours', 'evicted', 'house', 'be', 'auctioned', 'very', 'next', 'day', 'county', 'tax', 'sale', 'Yes', 'authorities', 'are', 'not', 'justified', 'proven', 'not', 'owe', 'tax', 'Alas', 'though', 'done', 'wrong', 'too', 'taken', 'granted', 'reply', 'was', 'read', 'agreed', '.At', 'first', 'have', 'found', 'guardian', 'angel', 'Deputy', 'Lester', 'Burdon', 'married', 'man', 'two', 'children', 'clearly', 'taken', 'beauty', 'also', 'genuinely', 'kind', 'man', 'admit', 'reality', 'situation', 'legal', 'counsel', 'find', 'place', 'stay', 'faith', 'system', 'lawyer', 'view', 'just', 'stand', 'clash', 'will', 'proud', 'ex-Colonel', 'Behrani', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'who', 'fled', 'homeland', 'family', 'when', 'Shah', 'was', 'deposed', 'who', 'struggled', 'secretly', 'San', 'Francisco', 'performing', 'low-paying', 'odd', 'hard', 'jobs', 'man', 'age', 'background', 'keep', 'up', 'facade', 'being', 'well-off', 'daughter', 'good', 'marriage', 'character', 'perfectly', 'drawn', 'authentic', 'old-fashioned', 'proud', 'patriarch', 'poured', 'remaining', 'life', 'savings', 'buying', 'Kathy', 'house', 'TREMENDOUS', 'bargain', 'planning', 'resell', 'substantial', 'mark-up', 'Thus', 'sell', 'back', 'price', 'bought', 'when', 'Kathy', 'lawyer', 'county', 'made', 'bureaucratic', 'error.He', 'not', 'just', 'proud', 'too', 'stubborn', 'moment', 'epiphany', 'too', 'late', 'disagreed', 'yet', 'empathized', 'senseless', 'pride', 'way', 'way', 'attitude', 'way', 'truthfully', 'designed', 'product', 'times', 'culture', 'character', 'Kathy', 'angered', 'few', 'times', 'one', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'truth', 'brother', 'helpless', 'tears', 'only', 'phone', 'conversation', 'TELL', 'HIM', 'THE', 'TRUTH', 'kept', 'screaming', 'co-owner', 'got', 'right', 'know', 'yet', 'other', 'lawyer', 'who', 'totally', 'side', 'go', 'f', 'Yes', 'Kathy', 'character', 'full', 'annoying', 'contradictions', 'So', 'got', 'ta', 'see', 'who', 'culprit', 'here', 'novelist', 'screen-writers', 'Nevertheless', 'consummate', 'actress.And', 'dear', 'Reader', 'will', 'not', 'regret', 'having', 'purchased', 'DVD']",N/A

Cunningham,"[209, 223]","With the exception of Niki Caro's sublime ""Whale Rider,"" no movie moved me more this past year than Vadim Perelman's ""House of Sand and Fog.""  This story of a broken and desperate young woman who loses her house because her depression won't allow her to simply open her mail and the determined and steadfast Iranian colonel who strives to secure a better life and future for his family is a cacophony of raw emotion and heartbreak.  Further, it is a meditation on what is important in life and how easy it is--no matter the intentions--to forget that very thing.This is a movie that is well photographed, beautifully adapted from Andre Dubus III's Oprah-approved novel of the same name and stunningly helmed by first time feature director Perelman.  But ""House"" is a film that is anchored by its performances.  There is hardly a false note in the acting (Ron Eldard occasionally seems overwhelmed by the powerhouse actors who surround him, however his work is still convincing).  Jennifer Connelly conveys Kathy Niccoli's despair wonderfully.  You can feel the depression wholly consuming her.Ben Kingsley is superb!  The scene in the hospital near the end of the film is a master class in acting.  Kingsley's work is brave throughout the film--he allows the audience to see Colonel Behrani's flaws and hold him accountable for them while also helping us to understand that his ambition, his dreams and desires are to serve the needs of his family.  It is among the most dynamic work by an actor in any year.As fine as Kingsley is, however, my favorite performance of last year and now one of my favorites of all time has to be the stunning work by the invaluable and flawless Shohreh Aghdashloo.  In her role as Behrani's patient and loving wife Nadi, Aghdashloo is grace under pressure. I dare you to catch this marvelous actress acting.  She is the heart and soul of this film.  It is through her expressive eyes that we understand what is at stake and what a home and family truly means.  In dialogue that blends Farsi and broken English, Aghdashloo's Nadi is heard loud and clear, there is no mistaking anything she is thinking or saying.  Let's face it: the Academy screwed up royally by awarding Renee Zellweger the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her Granny Clampett-ish Ruby in ""Cold Mountain"" (I say this completely realizing that Zellweger singlehandedly saved ""Cold Mountain"" from its own pretention).  The devastatingly beautiful Aghdashloo far and away claimed the prize with the superlative work she delivers in each and every scene she steals.  Here is hoping that Hollywood keeps this major, major talent working for years and years to come.Buy/rent ""House of Sand and Fog,"" which also boasts a very fine performance by young actor Jonathan Adbout as Kingsley and Aghdashloo's son, Esmail.  Despite its heavy subject matter, it is a dynamic piece of filmmaking complete with some of the best performances of last year.

This movie earns 5 stars even though it was so deeply depressing because of the masterful acting and beautiful scene shots.Kathy gets evicted from her house because she failed to pay a tax that the county mistakenly charged her with. It opens with her laying in bed and then shuffling to the door amidst unopened mail on the floor by the front door. The county evicts her and here begins the drama where small errors in judgment escalate into a nightmare. You keep thinking through the whole movie - if she only opened her stinking mail none of this would have happened. Even her lawyer asks her why she didn't open her mail.Enter Behrani, an Iranian immigrant played by Ben Kingsley). He is a very hard working man who wants desperately to improve his family's lot in life. He works two jobs with quiet dignity and saves all his wages until he can afford the down payment on Kathy's empty house, now up for auction.The character Kathy is so unsympathetic that you begin to feel she is the biggest idiot on the planet ... if only she got out of bed and opened her mail none of this would have happened. Behrani is an extremely honorable man who has worked hard all his life and has earned his right to the American Dream. Unfortunately, events spiral out of control when Kathy decides it is all Behrani's fault that she is no longer in her home. Meanwhile Behrani's completely innocent family goes about their lives never knowing the heartbreak that will come.The end of this movie was so incredibly sad that I literally had to watch a comedy to come out of the misery this movie left me in.

801346,A3OGMDFM045MQ7,B0001DMVBC,Matthew Farrell,"[2, 2]","This is a tough one to assess: I can see why people would be inclined to give it both 1-star and 5 star reviews. Personally, I see its strengths and weaknesses canceling each other out, hence my middle-of-the-road ranking. [[I'd actually give it 2-1/2, but I'm in a generous mood this moment, so I'll round up.]]The performances were solid, and the cinematography/direction/etc. was competent -- since this was Verelman's first time in the big chair, he should be commended for doing well with no prior experience. Sadly, that's about all I can say positively about this film.My two main dislikes are the plot and the characterizations. Each is a big enough speed bump to enjoying this that they're worth addressing separately.Central to the film's premise is the chain of events leading to Kathy losing her house in the first place. The audience is required to believe she was taxed for owning a business she never actually had, that the state made just one attempt (by mail) to get the money from her, and then with lightning speed were able to seize her house and auction it off -- with each subsequent step happening before the ink is dry from the previous. Sorry, but that just doesn't fly for me, and when the story's foundation requires an industrial dose of suspension-of-disbelief right from the start, it's not a good sign. There are numerous other inconsistencies to be found in the story, though they could be seen to be of less import, so due to their quantity and comparative triviality I'll skip cataloguing them. Suffice to say, my mental mantra while watching this was ""ummm... wait a second...""If one can get past the highly contrived nature of the story itself, we are left with the characters said plot is affecting. None of the characters are likeable, though I strongly suspect this was intentional. I actually don't have (that much of) a problem with that, but others won't be so forgiving. However, since the story is at heart a tragedy, failing to evoke any positive emotions from the audience towards the characters is a questionable move. Since I don't feel for the characters (except negatively,) their plight is severely dimished and lacks any real impact.Perhaps we actually are supposed to feel more sympathetically towards each character than what the end-result manages to invoke, but one of the major weaknesses of HOS&F; is the lacking of ***ANY*** back-story on the three main characters, except on the most superficial level. This is most noticeable with Kathy. We are supposed to assume that she is in some kind of funk (to the point that she won't even open her mail) yet I am completely at a loss to know what caused this in the first place. This would have been a golden opportunity to help me care for her, yet its absence is painfully noticeable and its lack forces the default of my not liking her all the more. The same applies, thought to a lesser extent, to Behrani and Lester. Remember: this is a tragedy drama, yet it makes no real effort to invoke sympathy on a genuine, human level.In all likelihood, the book addresses my concerns and fills in the gaps, but the film left me with no desire to read it and see what I'm missing. I also have no motivation to watch it again.HOS&F; had some genuine potential, but for me it just didn't work. As the widely divergent reviews here show, others are more forgiving than I am, but others are even less so.",3,A well-made film undermined by its own plot,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,3398,"['tough', 'one', 'assess', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'people', 'would', 'be', 'inclined', 'give', '1-star', '5', 'star', 'reviews', 'Personally', 'see', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'canceling', 'other', 'out', 'hence', 'middle-of-the-road', 'ranking', '[', '[', ""'d"", 'actually', 'give', '2-1/2', ""'m"", 'generous', 'mood', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'round', 'up', ']', 'performances', 'were', 'solid', 'cinematography/direction/etc', 'was', 'competent', 'was', 'Verelman', 'first', 'time', 'big', 'chair', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'doing', 'well', 'prior', 'experience', 'Sadly', 'can', 'say', 'positively', 'film.My', 'two', 'main', 'dislikes', 'are', 'plot', 'characterizations', 'big', 'enough', 'speed', 'bump', 'enjoying', ""'re"", 'worth', 'addressing', 'separately.Central', 'film', 'premise', 'chain', 'events', 'leading', 'Kathy', 'losing', 'house', 'first', 'place', 'audience', 'required', 'believe', 'was', 'taxed', 'owning', 'business', 'never', 'actually', 'had', 'state', 'made', 'just', 'one', 'attempt', 'mail', 'get', 'money', 'then', 'lightning', 'speed', 'were', 'able', 'seize', 'house', 'auction', 'off', 'subsequent', 'step', 'happening', 'ink', 'dry', 'previous', 'Sorry', 'just', ""n't"", 'fly', 'when', 'story', 'foundation', 'industrial', 'dose', 'suspension-of-disbelief', 'right', 'start', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'are', 'numerous', 'other', 'inconsistencies', 'be', 'found', 'story', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'less', 'import', 'so', 'due', 'quantity', 'comparative', 'triviality', ""'ll"", 'skip', 'cataloguing', 'Suffice', 'say', 'mental', 'mantra', 'watching', 'was', 'ummm', 'wait', 'second', 'one', 'can', 'get', 'highly', 'contrived', 'nature', 'story', 'are', 'left', 'characters', 'said', 'plot', 'affecting', 'None', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'strongly', 'suspect', 'was', 'intentional', 'actually', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'problem', 'others', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'so', 'forgiving', 'However', 'story', 'heart', 'tragedy', 'failing', 'evoke', 'positive', 'emotions', 'audience', 'characters', 'questionable', 'move', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'characters', 'negatively', 'plight', 'severely', 'dimished', 'real', 'impact.Perhaps', 'actually', 'are', 'supposed', 'feel', 'more', 'sympathetically', 'character', 'what', 'end-result', 'invoke', 'one', 'major', 'weaknesses', 'HOS', 'F', 'lacking', '***ANY***', 'back-story', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'most', 'superficial', 'level', 'most', 'noticeable', 'Kathy', 'are', 'supposed', 'assume', 'kind', 'funk', 'point', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'open', 'mail', 'yet', 'am', 'completely', 'loss', 'know', 'what', 'caused', 'first', 'place', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'help', 'care', 'absence', 'painfully', 'noticeable', 'lack', 'default', 'not', 'liking', 'more', 'same', 'applies', 'thought', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Behrani', 'Lester', 'Remember', 'tragedy', 'drama', 'real', 'effort', 'invoke', 'sympathy', 'genuine', 'human', 'level.In', 'likelihood', 'book', 'concerns', 'fills', 'gaps', 'film', 'left', 'desire', 'read', 'see', 'what', ""'m"", 'missing', 'also', 'have', 'motivation', 'watch', 'again.HOS', 'F', 'had', 'genuine', 'potential', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'widely', 'divergent', 'reviews', 'here', 'show', 'others', 'are', 'more', 'forgiving', 'am', 'others', 'are', 'even', 'less', 'so']",N/A

Ben Kingsley as Behrani says it succinctly when he compares we Americans to children, always looking for the next thrill, the next sweet, the next thing to excite us, the next thing to keep us occupied and interested (paraphrase).But whereas Dubus' novel is spare, direct and to the point, Perelman's film sometimes strays into melodrama, especially in the film's third act when the action gets too contrived and almost veers into silliness. But the epilogue is so strong, so poignant, so well acted by all that you soon forgive ""The House of Sand and Fog"" it's foibles.Ben Kingsley's performance is a wonder. As Behrani he plays a powerful man forced out of Iran with his wife and children only to work two menial jobs in the U.S. to support his family. He is proud yet cunning, saving his money when he can, always looking for ways to improve his lot. Behrani is a man who ultimately pays for his pride in the worst possible ways, yet he accepts his fate with dignity and courage. His fall from grace is not noble, but it is understandable.Jennifer Connolly as Kathy is one of the walking wounded. She is everything that Behrani is not: driven by her emotions, unable to act, overcome and unable to get passed her recent divorce, really a mass of raw exposed nerve endings. Kathy doesn't even have the wherewithal to take advantage of her beauty and her natural allure. She is so unaware, stripped of all confidence that she is a victim of her beauty.""The House of Sand and Fog"" is a gorgeous film to look at and Perelman uses the Northern California locales as a physical manifestation of his characters emotional state: densely foggy, bone chilling cold when emotions are in upheaval and difficult to read and brightly sunlight when things are straightforward and clear, which is not much of the time.Don't visit ""The House of Sand and Fog"" looking for a surgically precise world free of contradiction, you won't find it. Instead, you will find a world in conflict, a world full of compromise, a world heaving and erupting from the conflict of the have and the have-nots, the confident and prideful versus the tragically lost.",5,This Property is Condemned,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",2003,2438,"['Andre', 'Dubus', 'novel', 'Vadim', 'Perelman', 'film', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'masterful', 'subtle', 'frightening', 'parable', 'how', 'Americans', 'take', 'freedoms', 'granted', 'how', 'often', 'someone', 'country', 'few', 'freedoms', 'shake', 'up', 'wake', 'up', 'have', 'here', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Behrani', 'succinctly', 'when', 'Americans', 'children', 'always', 'looking', 'next', 'thrill', 'next', 'sweet', 'next', 'thing', 'excite', 'next', 'thing', 'keep', 'occupied', 'interested', 'paraphrase', 'whereas', 'Dubus', 'novel', 'spare', 'direct', 'point', 'Perelman', 'film', 'sometimes', 'melodrama', 'especially', 'film', 'third', 'act', 'when', 'action', 'too', 'contrived', 'almost', 'veers', 'silliness', 'epilogue', 'so', 'strong', 'so', 'poignant', 'so', 'well', 'acted', 'soon', 'forgive', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'foibles.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'performance', 'wonder', 'Behrani', 'powerful', 'man', 'forced', 'Iran', 'wife', 'children', 'only', 'work', 'two', 'menial', 'jobs', 'U.S.', 'support', 'family', 'proud', 'yet', 'cunning', 'saving', 'money', 'when', 'can', 'always', 'looking', 'ways', 'improve', 'lot', 'Behrani', 'man', 'who', 'ultimately', 'pride', 'worst', 'possible', 'ways', 'yet', 'fate', 'dignity', 'courage', 'fall', 'grace', 'not', 'noble', 'understandable.Jennifer', 'Connolly', 'Kathy', 'one', 'walking', 'wounded', 'everything', 'Behrani', 'not', 'driven', 'emotions', 'unable', 'act', 'overcome', 'unable', 'get', 'passed', 'recent', 'divorce', 'really', 'mass', 'raw', 'exposed', 'nerve', 'endings', 'Kathy', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'wherewithal', 'take', 'advantage', 'beauty', 'natural', 'allure', 'so', 'unaware', 'stripped', 'confidence', 'victim', 'beauty', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'gorgeous', 'film', 'look', 'Perelman', 'Northern', 'California', 'physical', 'manifestation', 'characters', 'emotional', 'state', 'densely', 'foggy', 'bone', 'chilling', 'cold', 'when', 'emotions', 'are', 'upheaval', 'difficult', 'read', 'brightly', 'sunlight', 'when', 'things', 'are', 'straightforward', 'clear', 'not', 'much', 'time.Do', ""n't"", 'visit', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'looking', 'surgically', 'precise', 'world', 'free', 'contradiction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'Instead', 'will', 'find', 'world', 'conflict', 'world', 'full', 'compromise', 'world', 'heaving', 'erupting', 'conflict', 'have', 'have-nots', 'confident', 'prideful', 'versus', 'tragically', 'lost']",N/A

No protypical hollywood happy ending, no techo-deus ex machina's; fits more in grand pre-1980 European/World/Art cinema framework except that the content is quite contemporary.Dreamworks stuff is generally an aesthetic cut above the ""here today gone tomorrow"" Hollywood fare. The photogarphy and the sound (I'm not talking about a compendium of recent or ""classic"" rock pop fare that has mininimal relation to the film)) is stunning.The story of the fight for house and land is almost imperialism in reverse at a micro level. Both Kingsly and Connely are victims of their separate reqimes: Kingsly of the fall of the Shah of IRAN; Connolly victimized by local, inefficient, government (and both,in their own ways, are damaged and a bit delusional) Is this represetative of a culture clash of immense symbolic meaning? Yes and no? We live in a paranoid, pluralistic often malfunctioning culture. That, as the movie slyly displays, often devolves to nothing better than a police state.

801352,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B0001DMVBC,Michael J. Mazza,"[72, 91]","&quot;House of Sand and Fog,&quot; directed by Vadim Perelman, is based on a novel by Andre Dubus III.  The film stars Ben Kingsley as Col. Behrani, a former Iranian military officer under the Shah who now lives with his family in the United States.  He buys a house from a government source, not knowing that the property was improperly seized from its prior owner (Jennifer Connelly).  This bureaucratic nightmare sets up a personal conflict that drives the film.&quot;House&quot; is a beautifully crafted film, rich in detail and visual impact.  But what really makes it shine are the excellent performances.  Connelly makes her wounded character's pain palpable.  As the colonel's wife, Shohreh Aghdashloo brings out both the inner lamb and lioness of the character.  Frances Fisher brings a steely authority to her small but memorable role as an attorney.  But it's Ben Kingsley who most impressed me.

801353,A1FG91CM8221X1,B0001DMVBC,Miles D. Moore,"[4, 6]","It's easy to nitpick Vadim Perelman's ""House of Sand and Fog,"" which has a few too many romantically fogged-in scenes of the Northern California coast set to James Horner's overly refulgent music. Yet what stays with you about the film is its real and powerful sense of tragedy, arising naturally from the all-too-believable mistakes made by its essentially decent yet deeply flawed characters. In the story adapted from the novel by Andre Dubus III, Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), a deeply depressed, recovering alcoholic, ignores months of letters sent by City Hall and ends up losing her house--which she inherited from her father--because of back taxes she didn't even owe in the first place. Mahmoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a former colonel in the Shah's army reduced to working menial jobs in America, buys the house at auction at a fraction of its value; his plan is to fix up the house and sell it for a good price, to finally put his wife and son on a sound financial footing and gain them the respectable place in society that they had in Iran. Thus the antagonists are set: both Kathy and Behrani have an absolute right to the house, and for both of them it means far, far more than just four walls and a roof. One is a rigid control freak, the other a fragile, emotionally volatile mess. The mix becomes far more toxic when Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), an unhappily married policeman with a crush on Kathy, is added to it: outwardly decent and solid, Lester turns out to have many more problems than it first appears, and in the bargain he has a badge. Step by step, the story leads to inevitable tragedy, with only one player left alone forever to try and decipher what went wrong. Perelman--a first-time feature director with a background in commercials and music videos--likes to wallow in self-consciously lyrical scenes, but for the most part he moves the action along crisply, getting unforgettable performances from his very fine cast. The best performances come from Kingsley, a man clinging desperately to respectability in the midst of a precipitous fall, and from the Iranian actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, the most moving of all as Behrani's sad, frightened wife. Connelly, Eldard, Frances Fisher as Kathy's lawyer and young Jonathan Ahdout as Behrani's teenage son also deserve the highest praise. The exquisite photography by Roger Deakins, the Coen Brothers' usual cameraman, is a major plus. The DVD includes many fascinating deleted scenes, including an alternate ending that may or may not be an improvement on what Perelman finally chose.

Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) is a proud Iranian immigrant, once a colonel in the Shah's army, who now struggles to provide a respectable lifestyle for his family. When Behrani purchases Kathy's repossessed home at auction with the intention of reselling it for a profit, he thinks that providence has finally found him. He will be able to own his own home and send his son to college. But the house was improperly seized by the County, and Kathy, who is without any place to live, desperately wants it back. The house is the only thing in her life that Kathy has to cling to. And the house represents a small amount of much-needed prosperity for the Behrani family. This conflict of needs is made worse by Lester (Ron Eldard), a corrupt police officer whom Kathy unwisely relies on in her time of need.""House of Sand and Fog"" is based upon the novel of the same name by Andre DuBus III. The film has been flawlessly directed by Vadim Perelman, who also co-wrote the screenplay. This is Perelman's first feature film. He has previously been a commercial director. I must say that this is the strongest debut by a director that I have ever seen. ""House of Sand and Fog"" is straight drama. The story is a personal one of realistic behavior under unfortunate circumstances. We watch as tragedy unfolds when two people, who are both right in their claim, claim the same thing, and emotions run high. Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the proud and determined Behrani, who has nevertheless been made so vulnerable by leaving behind his life's accomplishments and moving to a foreign country where he has nothing. Kathy is remarkably unsympathetic for a person who has obviously been wronged. But she eventually becomes more sympathetic as she develops some perspective on her situation. Casting Jennifer Connelly in this role meant that the character would be less trashy than in the book. But I think that was a wise decision, considering that Kathy has trouble getting the audience's sympathy as it is. And Jennifer Connelly does a wonderful job here. It is her best work to date. This should establish her as a true acting talent and put rumors that she is just a pretty face to rest. Ron Eldard is also fantastic in his supporting role as Lester, a thoroughly repulsive man, but not an easy one to make believable. Shohreh Aghdashloo is utterly affecting as Massoud Behrani's wife, Nadi, a caring and vivacious woman whose displacement has left her filled with sadness and fear.""House of Sand and Fog"" has a slow, contemplative, but even pace. And it's a certain type of film. It exhibits emotions, drama and tragedy on a personal scale. Those who prefer more action or a larger canvas will not like it. But Vadim Perelman has created a masterpiece of personal drama. The performances are outstanding. The cinematography is exquisitely evocative. ""House of Sand and Fog"" is as good as a film of this type gets.

Like many of the other reviewers, I thought this movie was visually and emotionally stunning. The photography beautifully depicts the fog-laden Northern California coast.

The actors playing his wife and son also are excellent as other reviewers have noted--worth renting the movie just to see their performances.And while Jennifer Connelly is good, I kept asking myself, why doesn't she seek help with some of the myriad nonprofits and government agencies available to help people in all kinds of distress? If her credit card didn't go through, does she make enough cash as a cleaning lady to pay for an attorney, who also (amazingly) does not know about the myriad of social service agencies we have in this country?  She has this pride that prevents her from telling her mother and brother about her situation, which might have brought her some help and resulted in a different ending and, alas, a different story. At one point she says she's been sober for three years. Well, what has she been doing those last three years? Her character just stumbles along, bereft.

I think the only character that was missing a serious amount of marables was Deputy Burdon.  Nothing this man did made sense and it is more him than the two opposing parties that escalates this bad situation into a colossal mess.  Whenever I thought his character was doing something holy unbelievable, I'd think about the stories that sometimes makes the ten o'clock news. (Kiddnapping, diaper-wearing astronaunts anyone?)

The fact is that these movies feel like they were created with the soul purpose of winning Oscars thus a lot of the magic falls deaf on the viewer. I approached ""House of Sand and Fog"" with this same mentality, expecting a good acting job, but a boring film; however, I am happy to report that this stereotype fell flat on its face. I have never read the book and so I did not know what to expect, but what I got was twist after twist that took me on a whirlwind flight of beauty and pain. At first, the movie seemed a little silly (how Jennifer's character behaved was a little over the top and selfish) and boring, but it morphed into a simply magnificent tale of love and loss. The really great thing though was the plot twist that occurred and how the story throws one back and forth (do I love this character or hate him/her).  It is not until the end that one can even begin to digest what has happened.Not only was the storyline fantastic, but the acting was phenomenal! Jennifer and Ben were simply fantastic, but the real ""show stealer"" was newcomer Shohreh Aghdashloo; oh my she was so wonderful and heartbreaking. By the end I can promise that you will cry (at least inside) more than you ever have for a movie; the people seem so real and personal to you (every one of them).

Yes, the storyline was a little weak, but the performances totally made up for that, and in a way, the simple story made it more believable.Things like that happen almost everyday. You get thrown out of your house, other people move in. The fact that Connelly's Kathy was a recovering alchoholic made the story more poignant. She was obviously having a rough time of it, before her house was taken away. This is why I warmed to her straight away (seeing a woman upset or depressed always makes me feel strongly for them).Kingsley family however, were also in a bad situation before they moved to the states. So it was hard to make a choice of which side to be on.I knew the ending was going to be sad, but when it came around, I didn't really feel totally connected to it. I think that maybe that was because from the beginning of the film, there is an air of dression about it, so by the end you're so used to feeling bad for the characters that you basically run out of sympathy.But I also think that it was Kingsley's character himself that made me feel so unfeeling. I didn't much like his character throughout, so I couldn't feel sad for him. When Connelly tried shooting herself, I was distraught! loL.

801377,A2BUGOG1JMLK0,B0001DMVBC,"Rebecca ""lotrgrl9""","[1, 2]","House of Sand and Fog is one of the standout dramas of 2003. Based on a novel by Andre Dubus III, this film tells the story of Kathy, a woman who has been abandoned by her husband and evicted from her house. An Iranian family moves into her home and the plot unravels as she attempts to reacquire the house.House of Sand and Fog is studded with superb acting performances. Sir Ben Kingsly breathes life into the character of Behrani, a colonel and a man of honor in his native Iran. He tries to keep his dignity in tact in a country that does not recognize his military accomplishments or his level of intelligence. Another outstanding performance is delivered by Jennifer Connelly as Kathy. Connelly perfectly portrays a woman whose life is spiraling downward as she faces an inward battle of depression and ceaseless frustration. Shohreh Aghdashloo delivers a heart-wrenching performance as Behrani's innocent wife who is challenged by a language barrier. Also, Lester, played Ron Eldard, is a character whose decisions tragically change the course of the film, but you can't help but watch him.The Filmmakers manage to subtly mirror the lives of Kathy and Behrani in a few ways. First, in the beginning, we see Behrani change out of his tattered work clothing and clean himself up in a hotel bathroom. Later, we see Kathy clean herself up in the same manner in a gas station bathroom. Another mirroring image we see is a scene where Behrani wraps himself in a blanket and in the next scene, Kathy is wrapped in a blanket in the same way. Also, when Behrani is intimate with his wife, the movements and the manner in which it is filmed mirrors the scene when Kathy is intimate with Lester.Although House of Sand and Fog is slow at times, it is an excellent movie. As an American, it provokes thoughts of the way we treat of immigrants and more simply, other human beings. It puts into perspective what we value and what we should value. The 'sand' in the title symbolizes shifting and change and the 'fog' represents the masking or the cloaking of character's thoughts, actions, and secrets. In the end, this film packs an emotional punch paired with brilliant acting and an intriguing storyline.",4,A Thought-Provoking Drama,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",2004,2198,"['House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'one', 'standout', 'dramas', '2003', 'Based', 'novel', 'Andre', 'Dubus', 'III', 'film', 'story', 'Kathy', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'abandoned', 'husband', 'evicted', 'house', 'Iranian', 'family', 'moves', 'home', 'plot', 'unravels', 'reacquire', 'house.House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'studded', 'superb', 'acting', 'performances', 'Sir', 'Ben', 'Kingsly', 'life', 'character', 'Behrani', 'colonel', 'man', 'honor', 'native', 'Iran', 'keep', 'dignity', 'tact', 'country', 'not', 'recognize', 'military', 'accomplishments', 'level', 'intelligence', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'delivered', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kathy', 'Connelly', 'perfectly', 'woman', 'life', 'spiraling', 'downward', 'inward', 'battle', 'depression', 'ceaseless', 'frustration', 'Shohreh', 'Aghdashloo', 'heart-wrenching', 'performance', 'Behrani', 'innocent', 'wife', 'who', 'challenged', 'language', 'barrier', 'Also', 'Lester', 'played', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'character', 'decisions', 'tragically', 'change', 'course', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'watch', 'him.The', 'Filmmakers', 'manage', 'subtly', 'mirror', 'lives', 'Kathy', 'Behrani', 'few', 'ways', 'First', 'beginning', 'see', 'Behrani', 'change', 'tattered', 'work', 'clothing', 'clean', 'up', 'hotel', 'bathroom', 'Later', 'see', 'Kathy', 'clean', 'up', 'same', 'manner', 'gas', 'station', 'bathroom', 'mirroring', 'image', 'see', 'scene', 'where', 'Behrani', 'blanket', 'next', 'scene', 'Kathy', 'wrapped', 'blanket', 'same', 'way', 'Also', 'when', 'Behrani', 'intimate', 'wife', 'movements', 'manner', 'filmed', 'mirrors', 'scene', 'when', 'Kathy', 'intimate', 'Lester.Although', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'slow', 'times', 'excellent', 'movie', 'American', 'thoughts', 'way', 'treat', 'immigrants', 'more', 'simply', 'other', 'human', 'beings', 'perspective', 'what', 'value', 'what', 'should', 'value', ""'sand"", 'title', 'shifting', 'change', ""'fog"", 'masking', 'cloaking', 'character', 'thoughts', 'actions', 'secrets', 'end', 'film', 'emotional', 'punch', 'paired', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'intriguing', 'storyline']",N/A

Starring the occasionally talented Ben Kingsley, partnered with Jennifer Connelly, this confused and uninteresting movie has no apparent redeeming qualities. Throughout the film the characters seem paper thin and unrealistic, and are made to follow a course of action dictated not by their own personality (which is consequently unable to properly develop) but by the forced delivery of the story. These are caricatures, at best, not people about whom we might grow to care. The flat and inconsistent characters are at least consistent with the endless clich&eacute;s which afront the viewer: The who-could-care-less illicit romance between the cop and the troubled, recovering alcoholic; The retired foreign army officer struggling against prejudice and determined to provide a better life for his family; The predictable and inaffective conclusion when protagonist and antagonist grow to a kind of mutual understanding.

801381,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0001DMVBC,RMurray847,"[26, 27]","This is an emotionally wrenching movie...utterly fascinating and devastating. Some critics have blasted the movie for having an over-the-top or far-fetched ending. The ending is quite devastating, but it is totally convincing and earns its ""tragedy"" the old fashioned way...by making us care VERY much for the characters.You probably know the basic plot.  Jennifer Connolly, a recovering addict who is still in deep depression, has ignored pleas to pay taxes on the home she inherited from her father, and is suddenly evicted with no place to go. The house is bought by Iranian emigree (and former colonel and confidant of the Shah) Ben Kingsley, as a way of bringing his family a little closer to the American dream.Kingsley has no idea the circumstances under which Connolly loses her house...he's got things pretty rough himself.  Some early scenes in the movie beautifully show the dignity with which Kingsley endures two horrible jobs...working on a road crew and in a convenience store. This is a proud man, a formerly important one, who strives mightily to keep up appearances...not just for his own pride, but so that his daughter can marry well and so his son can go to university.  He is a prickly  man, no doubt, but noble.Connolly realises that the house was really the last lifeline holding her to some semblance of sanity.  She readily admits that she didn't even take good care of it, but upon losing it, she becomes obsessed with getting it back.She is joined in this by the cop who initially helped evict her, played by Ron Ellard.  He has his own problems, including what he considers to be a shaky marriage.  His attraction to Connolly turns into an obsessive need to prove his worth to her by getting her the house back.  No matter what!I will say right here and now that this is the best acted film of the year.  21 GRAMS was no slouch in the acting department and MYSTIC RIVER was darn good too.  But these performances totally drew me in.  I found myself leaning forward in my seat in anxiety and empathy.  My wife gasped several times during the viewing, as the inevitable tragedy began to unfurl.  We both wanted things to change.  We were INVOLVED.Connolly is terrific as always.  She's a beautiful, quiet actress, who has a few moments in this movie that are so raw and stunning...her reserve finally comes down a bit.  The actress who plays Kingsley's wife (sorry, I don't have her name handy...my grievous error) is FABULOUS.  She MUST get nomitated for an Oscar...and she MUST get more work her in the states.  I was absolutely floored.  And the young man playing their naive, noble son is wonderful as well.  Torn between loyalties and eager to prove himself...he is a true heartbreaker.Ron Ellard is fantastically unlikeable, and that's perfect for the movie.  He holds his own quite well.Ben Kingsley, in my opinion, deserves the best actor Oscar. His colonel has so many layers, but Kingsley lets us see them all, playing just below the surface. His character is the opposite of his explosive work in SEXY BEAST.  There everything was on the surface...here it's hidden beneath his impossibly straight back and intense eyes.  I've always liked him a lot as an actor, but this film, I believe, puts him on yet a higher plane.  He is one of the greats!GO SEE THIS FILM!!",5,WHEW!!!

Andre Dubus III attempted to address the question in the novel House of Sand and Fog. Vadim Perelman attempted to make Dubus III's attempt into a movie. While neither was successful, the movie did a much better job of it than the book did.Kathy (Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly [Phenomena, Dark City]) has been left by her husband, and is not in the best shape. When her house is seized for nonpayment of a bill that never existed in the first place, she's not too happy about it. While she's trying to get it back, the house is bought at a foreclosure sale by Colonel Behrani (Oscar winner Ben Kingsley [Sexy Beast, Suspect Zero]), an Iranian who had to flee the country with his family after the collapse of the Shah's regime. Kathy gets a well-meaning but unstable police officer (Ron Eldard [ER]) into the mix, and things start to go wrong fast.Where Perelman's film improves (mightily) over the book is in giving us more of the Horatio Alger sense of the story-that both of these people, who have been wronged by their respective governments, deserve to triumph in the end. He brings out the parallels between the two in ways the book never achieved (a more malicious reviewer might say ""ways Dubus never even thought of""). Unfortunately, however, first-time director Perelman is not a Hitchcock, able to take mediocre source material and turn it into great film. He does the best he can, to be fair. Ben Kingsley's performance here is a mighty one and well worth your renting the film. The problem is that everything else here pales in comparison. None of the characters is much worth caring about (as in the book), the pace is glacial (as in the book), and the basic stupidity of some of the characters' actions is way too far beyond the pale to be believed (as in the book).Kingsley's performance is worth seeing.

Murena Jr. ""tedmurena""","[1, 2]","As we Americans see home owning as such an important aspect of our lives, this movie is appropriate in its highs and lows and shows what extremes we go to fulfill our dreams in spite of their actual value to us.  This film starkly poses the question: do we ever really own anything and what does it mean if we do?  The answer is anticipated but a solid answer is never fully reached.  It is a solidly depressing and tragic film that is shot beautifully and the actors portray their roles quite well.  Though the story boarders on the absurd at times it is compelling. This is a film that you will most likely want to watch intently and if you do it will rattle around your head for a long time.The film ends very tragically and I don't want to give away one iota of the plot.  The one thing that struck me about this film is that we watch the characters from more of a voyeuristic stance rather than a sympathetic one. We peer into the lives of the characters like we are at the windows of their homes: we look in from a close angle but we aren't intimate with them or their feelings.  While we all want to own a home and know first hand the emotions that attend our desire for ownership, we can not sympathize with any of the character very well at all.  The original owner of the house takes no responsibility for herself or her family's home until it is two late, and while we do feel for the plight and hopes of the Arabian family we have to admit that they are altogether stubborn.  The most despicable character is the policeman who leaves his family for the girl.This is one of those films that will leave you thinking for a while and though the ending is far fetched it makes a point upon reflection.  I condone the making of films that do not always resolve themselves happily and this film certainly does that.  As the imagined security and tranquility of home ownership is not able to be fulfilled all of the characters reach a less than perfect end.  I really liked this film and like that it poses questions that attack the gross materialism and selfishness of postmodern America.  With this film we can all examine our selves.

801385,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B0001DMVBC,Roland E. Zwick,"[7, 8]","""The House of Sand and Fog,"" easily one of the best movies of 2003, is a haunting and hypnotic tale about how even good, well-intentioned people - through lack of empathy and apparently harmless self interest - can end up hurting others and even themselves without meaning to do so.  It is also about how the most seemingly insignificant events in life can lead to unimaginable tragedies.Based on the novel by Andre Dubus III, ""The House of Sand and Fog"" stars Jennifer Connelly as Kathy, a young woman battling depression after her husband ran out on her eight months earlier.  One morning, already in the depths of despair, Kathy is informed that she is being evicted from her house for nonpayment of a business tax that she rightfully claims she doesn't owe.  Before the county can rectify the error, it has already placed the house up for auction.  Ben Kingsley plays Behrani, the man who buys the home unaware of its embattled history.  Behrani was a colonel in pre-Khomeini Iran, forced to flee that country with his wife and children when the Shah fell from power.  Now an American citizen, Behrani labors at two low paying jobs to keep his family living as much as possible in the style to which they were accustomed back home.  When Karen's repossessed home goes on the market at a bargain basement rate, Behrani purchases it, hoping to move his family there temporarily, then sell it at market value and move to an even better place.  Thus begins the bizarre conflict between two well meaning but stubborn people, both of whom have a stake in the situation, both of whom are equally victims of the system, and both of whom are determined to come out the winner in this contest of wills.Besides having the most interesting storyline of any movie of recent times, ""The House of Sand and Fog"" also boasts some of the most interesting characters as well.  Kathy is a beautiful woman who wants desperately to lead a healthy, normal life - she has been working to overcome her addiction to both cigarettes and alcohol - but the fates have simply not been very kind to her of late.  When she realizes that she has become the victim of a bureaucratic bungling, she knows that she must make a stand and fight, fully aware that the people with whom she is contending are as blameless as she is.  In a similar way, Behrani means no harm to anyone, yet he realizes that he too is not to blame for what has happened and resents being made to feel guilty because he is legally trying to make money to ensure a better life for his wife and son.  He also knows that, as an immigrant of Middle Eastern descent, he faces a higher hurdle to mount than white people who were born in this country.  The screenplay does a fine job underlining this subtle attitude of racism, particularly in the third main character, Lester, a sheriff's deputy who comes to care for Karen and who is willing to bend the law some and risk his own career to help her out.  Lester, like the other characters, is also willing to hurt others to ensure his own happiness, even abandoning his wife and two young children to start life anew with Karen.In addition to Connelly and Kingsley, there are superb performances by Ron Eldard as Lester, Jonathan Ahdout as Behrani's teenaged son, and Shohren Aghdashloo as Behrani's wife who is caught between her own strong-willed nature and the traditional role of subservient wife she knows she must play.  Aghdashloo provides some of the movie's most emotionally complex moments and scenes, as she struggles to understand both the events that are taking place around her and what those events say about the character of the man who is her husband.Moreover, ""The House of Sand and Fog"" is a beautifully written and directed film.  Writer/director Vadim Perelman establishes a lyrical, hypnotic tone through a camera that seems to be forever gliding through and around the scene of action.  The film is so confidently paced and structured that the two main combatants in the story - Karen and Behrani - do not even meet until almost an entire hour of the film has elapsed.  Perelman spends the first sections of the film sketching in the details of the main characters' lives, in order for us to better understand where they are coming from and what it is they want.  It would be so easy in a story like this one to pigeonhole one character as a hero and another as a villain, but the point of the story is that these are just ordinary people who don't want to hurt others but who end up doing so just the same.If the movie becomes a bit more melodramatic in the closing stretches than perhaps is warranted - striving for Shakespearean-type tragedy when a simpler resolution might have sufficed - at least it's TRYING to accomplish something meaningful, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of films these days.  ""The House of Sand and Fog"" may not be a perfect film, but it comes damn near close.  At the very least, it is a totally mesmerizing experience that is impossible to forget.",5,a genuine work of art,1089504000,"07 11, 2004",2004,5008,"['House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'easily', 'one', 'best',

It is purchased at auction by a former Colonel with the Shah of Iran. You feel empathy for both characters with the focus changing from time to time. I highly recommend seeing this film.

801388,AY3AVLL5IWW9,B0001DMVBC,Russell Fanelli,"[6, 8]","Readers will see many favorable and some unfavorable reviews of this highly publicized film.  I'm in the later category for the following reasons.The film is not well made.  Director Perelman had the difficult job of trying to communicate the complexity of a variety of story lines.  At its most basic, the story is about a young woman, Kathy Nicola, well played by Jennifer Connelly, who has lost her house by the California sea to a former Colonel in the Iranian Airforce.  The house is wrongly auctioned off to Col. Behrani, admirably played by Ben Kingsley, and he and his wife and son immediately take possession of the property and begin to improve it.  Col. Behrani has fallen on hard times and wants to sell the house for a profit as soon as possible.  Kathy opposes the sale and does all she can to get her cottage back.  Seems fairly straightforward.Unfortunaltely, Kathy has her own story.  She is a deeply depressed young woman who is struggling to hold on to her sanity.  We won't be surprised if she acts irrationally -- that is part of her character.  The next story is about Col. Behrani, who holds two menial jobs to attempt to keep his family in the style they have been accustomed to in Iran.  Again, we won't be surprised if he acts like a miliary man who sees things in black and white.  The conflict between the young woman and the colonel will be difficult to resolve, but it soon becomes impossible when Kathy meets a young police officer, Lester Burdon, played by Ron Eldard.  Lester falls in love with Cathy, leaves his wife and two children, and takes Kathy's side in the conflict.The stories of each character are complicated and need more time than the 126 minutes of the film to reconcile them.  For this reason, the plot starts to unravel as we watch each character take action we find difficult to comprehend.  Our frustration is compounded by the tragedy we think may have been avoidable.  Life plays some mean tricks on people, but in House of Sand and Fog, it is the director who acts as a deus ex machina, manipulating the plot to arrive at the final tragedy.  Saying &quot;that's the way things happen sometimes&quot; does not satisfy us.  We are left feeling somewhat angry and betrayed with what seems like a bad Hollywood ending.Why has this film generated so much praise?  The performances are first-rate, especially Ben Kingsley.  Jennifer Connelly is almost equally as impressive as the disturbed young woman.  Director Perelman needed to give them a screenplay worthy of their talents.  For some viewers, these performances will be reason enough to buy or rent the film.  For those people who want a story that makes sense, they will experience frustration as they watch in disbelief as the final tragedy plays itself out.

801390,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0001DMVBC,Samuel McKewon,"[2, 4]","It hovers over the San Francisco coastline, tucked in the hills at the end of the road, more a bungalow than family home. Shrouded in fog, eroded by years of average upkeep, it's the kind of place that swells when it rains. When former Iranian Col. Massoud Behrani (Ben Kingsley) moves in, it's initially for the shortest of stays - he bought the house in an auction, and hopes to resell it for quadruple its value. And yet - it reminds him of his old vacation home on the Caspian Sea, where he cut down the trees to get a view of the water. He may keep it for the summer and let his son skateboard the neighborhood, and his wife, Nadi (Shohreh Agdashloo), reawaken after years of struggle and bitterness.What's so honorable about Vadim Perelman's ""The House of Sand and Fog"" is how it views this family and its connection to the house despite it being sold in the auction after it was illegally taken away from its previous owner, recovering drug addict Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connelly), in a tax dispute. The law is no longer on Kathy's side, but our sympathy is: Her father left the house for her and her new husband, who left himself one morning. And yet the movie, based on Andre Dubus III equally strong novel, treats both parties as it should: Fragile, wounded units, clinging to a house neither can definitively call home, the last piece of the American dream still available to them.If ""Sand and Fog"" embraces the flaws of these characters - both Col. Behrani and Kathy are intractable, explosive personalities, more doomed by every white lie they tell, every corner they round off - it tacitly indicts the American values that invest more in property than self, and the movie's representation of ""law,"" a married cop named Lester (Ron Eldard) who takes up Kathy's cause, as well as her bed.Lester and Kathy meet on the morning she's evicted, and later, as Kathy sifts through her remaining stuff at a storage shed, there's Lester, just checking in, because it's on his way. A literate, passive bully, Lester is a hero looking for a pretty damsel; the gorgeously wrecked Kathy, with her no brand smokes and depressed humor, fits the bill. In turn, Lester is that spark of indignity Kathy needs to challenge Col. Behrani for her old home.Behrani, the exiled militant, is one of the more complex characters of recent cinema, and Kingsley fiercely brings him dimension. Proud to a fault, with dark crevices of anger and guilt over the two dissatisfied women in his life (wife and daughter, both of whom remember the cozy military life in Iran) Behrani works two menial jobs just to keep afloat in an apartment he can barely afford. Then the house becomes available. Its resale represents his son's college money, the companionship of his wife. Kingsley, in what will probably be the last powerhouse performance of his career, slowly burns as Kathy keeps popping up, as Lester taps old photos on the wall in intimidation. Agdashloo, an Iranian exile herself, is equally good as the (exquisitely) beautiful, weak-willed companion who was never meant to leave home.Perelman, a Russian, is a competent first-time director; ""Sand and Fog"" is not exactly a visual feast, but a scene featuring Kathy in her old bathtub is among the best of the year. Perelman pushes the gas pedal too often on James Horner's musical score - it intrudes in two of Kingsley's gut-wrenching moments - and, in writing the screenplay, he fudges a bit on Dubus' original ending for Kathy. But he retains the shocking turn of events that ruin Behrani's family.As in the book, the house itself is no prize, and more a symbol to fill the void of the character's lives. Kathy - played by Connelly as a muted, strung out soul along for the ride, perfectly willing to end it violently - represents that American segment of society so immune to the outside world of ambition and commerce that, eventually, its fruits are ripped away. Behrani, meanwhile, never seems to obtain the measure of material success his military background demands, nor the humility needed for an immigrant to do well in white-collar business.

I was happily wrong.House Of Sand And Fog is a drama that blooms with carefully orchestrated, subtle suspense, and carries with it the slight reek of prejudice.  Who would you trust to be honest and fair?  A Muslim Iranian family?  A recovering, unemployed addict?  A police officer?  And just what type of greed would you consider to be the worst type?Kathy (played by extremely talented Jennifer Connelly-Labyrinth, Requiem For A Dream) is a recovering addict, recently inheriting an older but cozy house from her father.  However, the county mistakenly believes that she owes business tax and repossesses her property, leaving her homeless.  Kathy is helped out by Officer Lester Burdon (played by Ron Eldard-Ghost Ship), who gives her an attorney's phone number and helps her pack her things.Colonel Massoud Behrani (played by the incomparable Ben Kingsley-Suspect Zero, Schindler's List, Sneakers), an Iranian immigrant, finds the house listed for sale by the county and quickly purchases it.  Behrani has spent every penny earned at working several jobs to ensure his daughter was married into a suitable family.  Now he must see to his son's college, and dreams of fixing up the old house and making enough profit for his son's future.Kathy hires an attorney to get her house back, but Behrani will not sell back to the county for less than four times the amount he paid for it.  When Kathy sees that the law moves too slow, she confronts the Behrani's in an attempt to appeal to their sense of justice.In the midst of her conflict with the Behrani's, Lester continues to take more than a casual interest in Kathy, to the point of leaving his wife and children to start fresh with her.  How far will Lester and Kathy go to get back what rightfully belongs to her?  Is Colonel Behrani an evil man or a victim himself?  You will find that things are not always how they first appear, and will be holding your breath by the time House Of Sand And Fog reaches its surprising and powerful finish.The lines between good and evil are thin and silvery gray in this exceptional dark tale of misguided intensions and ill-gotten gains.  The photography is virtually stunning, the script tight, the acting above spectacular, and the emotion all too real.  Special mention goes to actress Shohreh Aghdashloo who plays Nadi Behrani, and to Jonathon Ahdout who plays Esmail Behrani.  Their superior supporting roles created a truly believable family with the Behranis.Don't think for one minute that House Of Sand And Fog is your usual, uninspired drama.  This is a dark journey into the heart, touching those black spots that leak poison inside all of us.  Definitely worth a purchase.

Those of you that can stomach sadness and suffering will be able to admire all the wonderful elements this production presents, from the actors to the settings. However, if dramatic situations spoil the moment for you, you may be able to appreciate the quality of the production, like my wife did, but will probably end up with a bitter taste in your mouth.Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Connoly) is a young widow that is being thrown out of her property for owing a ridiculously low amount of money in property taxes. But right from the start, we know that the ending of this story will not be all joy and happiness, since we catch a glimpse of the future. In this vision, Nicolo appears to be in shock outside of her house, surrounded by police and paramedics that are carrying dead people away from the scene. Following this revelation, we are presented with a collection of scenes that pique our curiosity: a young colonel (Ben Kingsley) cutting down trees that obstruct the view from his new house towards the Caspian Sea, an older colonel Behrani in the luxurious wedding of his daughter, and finally the same Behrani working with a crew on a highway and dreaming of buying a house that he finds in the classified adds.Behrani and his wife go through the effort of making everyone believe that they have money and a high economic status, with not even their kids being aware of the deceit. However, Nicolo's house presents a great opportunity for Behrani, since he is planning to buy it, make some improvements and then sell it at a handsome profit. When he achieves his goal of purchasing the property, he is in heaven, but everything comes tumbling down when Kathy's lawyer begins with his attempts for trying to repossess the house. That is when the hostilities begin and matters get complicated with other events, like a crooked police officer getting involved in the conflict.Firmly supported by a good performance by Connoly and an amazing job by Kingsley, which should have placed him as a serious candidate for the Oscar for Best Actor, this movie has all the required characteristics to provide a valuable experience. The plot is extremely engaging and it does not lack tense moments and its fair share of suspense. As I mentioned before, only those that are very sensitive to sad situations and suffering should stay away.

801395,A1FCWRSICTO2AH,B0001DMVBC,S. Harris,"[6, 6]","It's not a big leap to see ""House of Sand and Fog"" as the best movie of the year.  But the Academy Awards have fallen to such an extent, that it's difficult to take them seriously anymore, unless you want to sift through the nominations for the real gold.  Connelly, Kingsley, and Shohred Aghdashloo all give award worthy performances in a story that has, by its end, enough bodies tragically left on the stage to call up comparisons with Shakespeare or Euripedes.There are holes in the story - but there are holes in Lear for that matter.  For example, Connelly's (Kathi Niccoli in the film) cop lover (Ron Eldard) is not to be believed in his stupidity.  If his role wasn't so pivotal, it could easily be brushed off.  Further, surrounded by the three main actors, he ends up looking like a deer caught in the headlights.  Then there's the real estate question - it seems a bit of stretch in our super litigious society that a repossession and sale could occur so quickly given a cloud on the title...but I'm nitpicking.The overwhelming drama of the story far outweighs these problems.  Connelly is superb as the vague and lost house cleaner Kathi.  Her performance has the kind of nuance and depth that I didn't find in her Oscar winning effort in ""A Beautiful Mind.""  At least Connelly is showing, unlike other recent babe winners (Berry, Roberts, Kidman), she has both the looks and the acting chops.  Kingsley.  What can you say?  The guy is just a great actor who should have a row of Oscars by now. (To get a sense of his range, check out ""Sexy Beast."") As the Iranian Colonel Behrani, Kingsley supplies a character that is proud (too proud as it turns out), a lover of tradition, but not so inflexible that he hasn't a heart when the moment calls for it.  He is a good but flawed man who loves his family and is trying to do the best for them.  And finally, there is Shored Aghdashloo's performance as Nadi, a good woman crushed by events.  Nadi's struggles with the language, her kindness to Kathi, the love (and tension) that exists between her and her husband, are all finely balanced and incorporated into a real human being and not another Hollywood cut-out. (Boy did she get ripped off at the Oscars.  I guess her name just wasn't zippy enough.)  Essentially, the heart of ""House"" is found in the way these three great actors play off of each other.  And it is something special to behold, turning the tragic wheel ever tighter as the movie progresses.  The ending wasn't really a surprise - shock to me, but rather inexorable, much like Medea stringing up her kids.",5,Move of the year,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,2581,"['not', 'big', 'leap', 'see', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'best', 'movie', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'have', 'fallen', 'extent', 'difficult', 'take', 'seriously', 'anymore', 'want', 'sift', 'nominations', 'real', 'gold', 'Connelly', 'Kingsley', 'Shohred', 'Aghdashloo', 'give', 'award', 'worthy', 'performances', 'story', 'end', 'enough', 'bodies', 'tragically', 'left', 'stage', 'call', 'up', 'comparisons', 'Shakespeare', 'Euripedes.There', 'are', 'holes', 'story', 'are', 'holes', 'Lear', 'matter', 'example', 'Connelly', 'Kathi', 'Niccoli', 'film', 'cop', 'lover', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'not', 'be', 'believed', 'stupidity', 'role', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'pivotal', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'brushed', 'off', 'Further', 'surrounded', 'three', 'main', 'actors', 'up', 'looking', 'deer', 'caught', 'headlights', 'Then', 'real', 'estate', 'question', 'bit', 'stretch', 'super', 'litigious', 'society', 'repossession', 'sale', 'could', 'occur', 'so', 'quickly', 'given', 'cloud', 'title', ""'m"", 'nitpicking.The', 'overwhelming', 'drama', 'story', 'far', 'problems', 'Connelly', 'superb', 'vague', 'lost', 'house', 'cleaner', 'Kathi', 'performance', 'kind', 'nuance', 'depth', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'effort', 'A', 'Beautiful', 'Mind', 'least', 'Connelly', 'showing', 'other', 'recent', 'babe', 'winners', 'Berry', 'Roberts', 'Kidman', 'looks', 'acting', 'chops', 'Kingsley', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'guy', 'just', 'great', 'actor', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'row', 'Oscars', 'now', 'get', 'sense', 'range', 'check', 'Sexy', 'Beast', 'Iranian', 'Colonel', 'Behrani', 'Kingsley', 'character', 'proud', 'too', 'proud', 'out', 'lover', 'tradition', 'not', 'so', 'inflexible', ""n't"", 'heart', 'when', 'moment', 'good', 'flawed', 'man', 'who', 'family', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'finally', 'Shored', 'Aghdashloo', 'performance', 'Nadi', 'good', 'woman', 'crushed', 'events', 'Nadi', 'struggles', 'language', 'kindness', 'Kathi', 'love', 'tension', 'husband', 'are', 'finely', 'balanced', 'incorporated', 'real', 'human', 'being', 'not', 'Hollywood', 'cut-out', 'Boy', 'did', 'get', 'ripped', 'off', 'Oscars', 'guess', 'name', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'zippy', 'enough', 'Essentially', 'heart', 'House', 'found', 'way', 'three', 'great', 'actors', 'play', 'other', 'something', 'special', 'behold', 'turning', 'tragic', 'wheel', 'ever', 'tighter', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'shock', 'rather', 'inexorable', 'much', 'Medea', 'stringing', 'up', 'kids']",N/A

The subtleties of his facial expressions presented in moments of either joy or frustration are so masterfully restrained, it's a pleasure simply to watch him!In ""House of..,"" he plays an ex Iranian militiary man now working menial jobs in the US. It's probably a predicament that we rarely think about -- perhaps we'd prefer not -- and it's certainly a subject that Hollywood would rather brush by. But Perelman's film, based on Andre Dubus III's 1999 best seller, not only corrects this social/artistic delinquency but does it in such a bold and imaginative way and with such driving force that ""House of Sand and Fog"" works as much as a potent entertainment as it does as a morality play.I haven't seen much of Jennifer Connelly before, but her absolutely knock-out presence on the screen as a murky character with an alcoholic past is dazzling. When the characters of Kingsley and Connelly finally clash halfway through the film, the film, having until then been a paean to silence and unspoken loyalties, becomes a terrifying thriller, riveting everyone with whom I saw the picture. Perelman moves from a mood piece to a suspenseful drama effortlessly. A jaw-dropping conclusion completes a powerful, unbelievably sad piece of work.It's a harrowing story, cathartic and elegant, beautifully filmed, stirringly told.

Kathy is a recovering alcoholic/addict who is trying to cope with the loss of her husband after he leaves her. She has no family ties as evidenced in brief phone conversations throughout the movie. Undeniably, Kathy's home is the only stability she has in her lonely world. To Kathy, the house of sand and fog is her dream of what was, things in the past and her present sanity.However, unbeknownst to Kathy, her treasured home is mistakenly up for public auction due to unopened mail and supposed, unpaid taxes.Ben Kingsley as Massoud Amir Behrani, a former colonel in the Iranian military under the Shah, Behrani works construction during the daylight hours and as a gas station attendant at night, all the while, saving his money, moving from place to place and looking for a better job so that he, his wife, Nadi and beloved only son, Esmail  may truly live the American Dream. Behrani happens to see Kathy's home up for auction in the newspaper and decides to purchase the small home, fix it up and sell it for a profit. To Behrani, the house of sand and fog is his dream of the future. A dream of a better life and returning a sense of pride for him and his whole family.Once Kathy finds out that she is to be evicted from her own home and the property sold, she consults with Attorney, Connie Walsh played by Frances Fisher, in hopes of returning her home to her.  Alas, no quick and speedy hope is found in the legal system and Kathy meets...Sympathetic and pathetic policeman, Lester, played by Ron Eldard.  Lester is in a loveless marriage with two children and falls in love teetering on obsession with Kathy and her plight.  Lester leaves his family to try and help Kathy. Lester becomes her lover, confidant, drinking partner and friend.  To Lester, the house of sand and fog means a new life starting over with Kathy and being a hero in her eyes.Once Kathy falls off the wagon due to Lester's influence, things start quickly spinning out of control. What starts out as a legal battle soon escalates into all manner of personal confrontations with dire results. Lester bungles up many a thing during the film including harrassment, blackmail, and dare I say, much, much worse...This is a depressing tale of dreams broken and, moreover, of people lost and hurting with nowhere or no one to turn to. There are times in the film as a viewer where it's hard to feel compassion for Kathy or for Behrani due to their human mistakes, personality quirks, and emotional outbursts but in the terrible, terrible end, the compassion felt for both sides is quite overwhelming.Highly Recommended!",4,"The House Of Sand, Fog, & More Importantly, Dreams...",1096243200,"09 27, 2004",2004,2879,"['star', 'film', 'crux', 'story', 'just', 'revolve', 'around', 'inanimate', 'object', 'small', 'home', 'California', 'hills', 'Pacific.The', 'house', 'was', 'given', 'occupant', 'beginning', 'film', 'owner', 'Kathy', 'Niccolo', 'played', 'Jennifer', 'Connelly', 'Kathy', 'recovering', 'alcoholic/addict', 'who', 'trying', 'cope', 'loss', 'husband', 'family', 'evidenced', 'brief', 'phone', 'conversations', 'movie', 'Undeniably', 'Kathy', 'home', 'only', 'stability', 'lonely', 'world', 'Kathy', 'house', 'sand', 'fog', 'dream', 'what', 'was', 'things', 'past', 'present', 'sanity.However', 'unbeknownst', 'Kathy', 'treasured', 'home', 'mistakenly', 'up', 'public', 'auction', 'due', 'unopened', 'mail', 'supposed', 'unpaid', 'taxes.Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Massoud', 'Amir', 'Behrani', 'former', 'colonel', 'Iranian', 'military', 'Shah', 'Behrani', 'construction', 'daylight', 'hours', 'gas', 'station', 'attendant', 'night', 'while', 'saving', 'money', 'moving', 'place', 'place', 'looking', 'better', 'job', 'so', 'wife', 'Nadi', 'beloved', 'only', 'son', 'Esmail', 'may', 'truly', 'live', 'American', 'Dream', 'Behrani', 'see', 'Kathy', 'home', 'up', 'auction', 'newspaper', 'purchase', 'small', 'home', 'fix', 'up', 'sell', 'profit', 'Behrani', 'house', 'sand', 'fog', 'dream', 'future', 'dream', 'better', 'life', 'returning', 'sense', 'pride', 'whole', 'family.Once', 'Kathy', 'out', 'be', 'evicted', 'own', 'home', 'property', 'sold', 'Attorney', 'Connie', 'Walsh', 'played', 'Frances', 'Fisher', 'hopes', 'returning', 'home', 'Alas', 'quick', 'speedy', 'hope', 'found', 'legal', 'system', 'Kathy', 'meets', 'Sympathetic', 'pathetic', 'policeman', 'Lester', 'played', 'Ron', 'Eldard', 'Lester', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'two', 'children', 'love', 'teetering', 'obsession', 'Kathy', 'plight', 'Lester', 'family', 'try', 'help', 'Kathy', 'Lester', 'lover', 'confidant', 'drinking', 'partner', 'friend', 'Lester', 'house', 'sand', 'fog', 'new', 'life', 'starting', 'Kathy', 'being', 'hero', 'eyes.Once', 'Kathy', 'wagon', 'due', 'Lester', 'influence', 'things', 'start', 'quickly', 'spinning', 'control', 'What', 'out', 'legal', 'battle', 'soon', 'manner', 'personal', 'confrontations', 'dire', 'results', 'Lester', 'up', 'many', 'thing', 'film', 'including', 'harrassment', 'blackmail', 'dare', 'say', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'depressing', 'tale', 'dreams', 'broken', 'moreover', 'people', 'lost', 'hurting', 'nowhere', 'one', 'turn', 'are', 'times', 'film', 'viewer', 'where', 'hard', 'feel', 'compassion', 'Kathy', 'Behrani', 'due', 'human', 'mistakes', 'personality', 'quirks', 'emotional', 'outbursts', 'terrible', 'terrible', 'end', 'compassion', 'felt', 'sides', 'quite', 'overwhelming.Highly', 'Recommended']",N/A
801398,AARLHHM23KF1V,B0001DMVBC,S.,"[1, 1]","I don't think it's a dreadful movie at all.  The cast is excellent.  Yes, it's not a happy ending but it does convey important messages.There are many poor immigrants in the United States even before they arrive here, but many of those are actually from an affluent background.  However, facing a new country, language and culture, there is tremendous pressure that ""the natives"" cannot understand or ever experience.  The responsibility, pride, and being able to provide (=success) are always the major elements for the male in the immigrant families.  The extreme pressure is on any first generation immigrants but especially on those who are from the countries they cannot return due to political threats or so called periphery countries.Opposite from the immigrant family in the movie, the lead actress and her lover represent the irresponsible generation of this great country:  alcohol, too easy sex, too easy to give up by drinking and suicide, irresponsible to the lovely but boring marriage life, even police force is at fault - is it really necessary for the police to shoot?Another message I see from watching this movie is: immigrants are taking over the homes of ""the natives"".  This can be a dangerous message if it is wrongly conceived.  The setting of the story locates in the San Francisco Bay Area.  In the Bay Area (the area around and includes San Francisco peninsula), a small to medium size and 60 years old or older family house can easily cost $900K in San Francisco.  Immigrants continuously move in while the supply never catches up is one of the factors that why the housing is ridiculously high.  The fact about the immigrants is that they save not only because of the original culture they carry with them to America but also the sense of security.  No matter what, the money they use to finally buy their houses is the hard-earned money as any other American families do.The reason I mention the housing is because I am also an immigrant.  But, I am not as lucky as those who can afford to buy a house or apartment around the Bay Area.  I feel bad though when my friends of ""the natives"" complain about the immigrants who drive the housing market this crazy.  But, we should never forget that there are many ""the natives"" get benefits from it, and the immigrants is very important to the energy and the health of the economy in California.Anyway, the story might be too drama-like, but I would say the pressure the immigrant families in the U.S. is no less than the one in the movie.  The role of the leading actress might be too pathetic, but her role can be a reflection of our generation.A reviewer mentions the book is much better.

801401,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B0001DMVBC,S. Schell,"[2, 3]","A great drama that just missed the Oscar, ""House of Sand and Fog"" comes from the 1999 novel of the same name by Andre Dubus III, once a finalist for the National Book Award and making Oprah's prestigious book club list.  It tells the resonating tale of two people battling over what appears to the reader to be a trifle of a house, but is the definition of the American dream to them and the price they both pay for their selfishness.Jennifer Connelly is Kathy Nicolo, a hard-luck house cleaner who is a recovering alcoholic/drug user.  She wakes up one morning to find the county clerk's office knocking on her door and when she opens it, a man in a suit walks right in, slapping an eviction notice on her door.  He notifies her that her house is up for public auction the very next day and she must vacate the premises immediately.  Kathy stands there dazed, cloaked only in a t-shirt and robe that reaches down to her knees.  A young police officer named Lester Burdon (Eldard) files in after the suit-and-tie bully, his expression and demeanor largely sympathetic.  He introduces himself and offers to not only help her pack her things but to find her a place to stay as well.  Her acceptance of his offer is the beginnings of an illicit affair despite the fact that Lester is married with two young children.As Kathy confers with her lawyer Connie Walsh (Fisher) and fights to get her house back over a discrepancy regarding a business tax, an Iranian named Massoud Behrani (Kingsley) spots the add for the auction in the newspaper and decides to buy the house at its severely reduced price, renovate it and then resell it at its true value in order to turn a profit for a better house.  The marrying off of his daughter Soraya (Rawat) has reduced his financial burden but has also in turn drained his pockets and his wife Nadi (Aghdashloo) and son Esmail (Ahdout) are sustained by his two demeaning jobs.  Ashamed to admit his real sources of income, Behrani changes into a suit and tie before walking into the apartment in the evenings, working countless hours as both as a trash collector (a grueling job for a man his age) and a convenience store clerk.The house seems to be Behrani's salvation and they move in quickly, Nadi at first resistant to the move, claiming she doesn't want to live like a gypsy.  The real gypsy lifestyle, however, is owned by Kathy, who goes from a cheap motel to sleeping in her car after her credit card is denied twice.  Unable to part with her home, she consistently shows up there and beseeches Behrani to find another house because hers was sold by mistake despite the legitimacy of the sale.  When she refuses his offer to buy it back from him for its real value, he brusquely escorts her off the property, bruising her inner arm in the process.  Lester keeps checking up on her and motivated by his feelings for her, offers to help Kathy in her crusade to get her house back.  His aid ends up being the unconscionable harrassment and intimidation of the Behrani family, particularly after seeing Kathy's bruises.The battle between the two parties continues to escalate and culminates with both Kathy and Lester doing the unthinkable, both of their actions leading to a highly tragic ending that no one could predict.All the actors here give brilliant performances, Connelly and Kingsley in particular.  Kingsley gives another upstanding portrayal (when has he not, really?) as Behrani, the patriarch of his formerly affluent family now scraping to sustain a small semblance of the opulent lifestyle in America that they once knew in Iran.  He is cool-headed, compassionate and hard-working, never overlooking an opportunity to make things better for his family - they are his duty, his life, his one and only love.  Connelly is superb as Kathy, a woman heavily dwelling upon past mistakes as she fights to gain back the one true symbol of her waning prosperity.  The bungalow becomes the stubborn passion of both and in their battle to keep it, they lose sight of what is really important.  It is only when they chance to see each other's pain that they develop a mutual empathy, but by then it is too late - their fates are irrevocably sealed.The score by James Horner (Titanic, Braveheart) is subtle and morose, unobtrusive and evoking just the right amount of melancholy.  Fledgling Ukrainian director Vadim Perelman handles Dubus's novel with grace and poetry and neophyte screenwriter Shawn Lawrence Otto follows the story closely, making it one of the better book-to-film adaptations out there.Bottom line: A heartachingly beautiful drama, ""House of Sand and Fog"" was nominated for three Oscars in 2004 (Best Actor for Kingsley, Best Supporting Actress for Aghdashloo, Best Original Score for Horner) but failed to pick up any trophies and it's baffling, as is no nomination whatsoever for the moving performance by Jennifer Connelly.  But sometimes the best movies out there are the ones who take second place when they should've been in first.

O'Blenis,"[2, 4]","With all the emotional trauma, the heartbreak and the seemingly unresolvable angst, it's an enormous tribute to the power of the material and the talent of everyone on both sides of the camera that ""House Of Sand And Fog"" doesn't come off so depressing as to be almost impossible to get through.  It's sad yes, but sadness isn't all there is here; there are stunning moments of brightness, beauty and compassion amidst the darkness and the desperation, combining for a haunting and mesmerising movie.When a troubled young woman (Kathy, played by Jennifer Connelly) loses her house due to a government screwup concerning 'unpaid' taxes that she never actually owed in the first place, and the house goes up for auction, it allows Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a hard-working immigrant from Iran (where he previosly lived a life of wealth prior to the overthrow of the Shah) to finally buy a house for his family, with the intention of residing there awhile, building it up, selling it for a profit and the tiny auction sum he paid for it and finally digging his family out of the financial hole into which they've been sliding.  The tragic thing is, neither Kathy nor Behrani are really at fault for the conundrum this all creates, but a heated tug-of-war for the house begins, with the reasons on both sides running much deeper than mere monetary concerns.  There is a ton of backstory to both these characters, and for some of the other characters as well, that is never specifically spelled out but is left for the viewer to decipher, and it adds enormous weight to the show, and even more sympathy for those characters that have been struggling with truly dark demons.  In addition to the exceptional jobs done by Connelly and Kingsley, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Jonhathan Adout, and Ron Eldard have to be singled out as well for their own truly great performances.

This story is about the gray areas in life as we rarely walk in absolute black and white.

Her family doesn't seem to be close enough for her to lean on(why else hide so much from them?), and she seems very alone-that's why I sympathized with her. Kingsley's character shows glimpses of violences hidden underneath his very contained character-you get the message he isn't any saint, and you don't need much historical background on Iran to catch onto to his controlling ways within the family. But you also see this desperate man's chance to start over again, and it's heart breaking to watch how things just go spiraling out of control.

801415,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0001DMVBC,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","One interesting thing about 'House of Sand and Fog' is that the film in its opening credits, quite unaccountably, put the name of Jennifer Connelly BEFORE that of Ben Kingsley.  What a strange order, for the strength of the film, which often is marred by clithed direction and improbable story, all comes unmistakeably from Ben Kingsley's powerful acting.The story is quite unbelievable, at least that's what I thought.  Because of some mistakes, one American woman Kathy (Connelly) and one Iranian father (formerly a colonel in his country) Behrani fight over the legal right of ownership of one old house by the seaside.  Kathy, evicted from the home, sticks to her house (her father's house), or the memories attached to it while Beharani, having paid the money, needs it to settle down in this new country.The point of the film is not about the legal side; it's about the characters, all flawed, but all too human.  While there is a better way out for the both parties, and perhaps they know it, they commit many mistakes because of their pride, or obsession, and finally come to the point where there is no turning back.Now, the good thing about the film is its nuance in characters.  They are complex, round, and mostly believable, owing to great acting from Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghdashloo as the ex-colonel's wife.  Aghdashloo, herself born in Iran, not only gives credibility to the melodramatic story, but also represents the compassionate, and fragile side of the immigrants coming to America, where little is familiar to them.  And as to masterful performance of Ben Kingsley, what can I add?If Jennifer Connelly pales away beside these two veterans, that is not because her acting is inadequate -- she is perhaps better than in 'Beautiful Mind' -- but because her role, and the sub-plot about the love affair with a local cop (Ron Eldard), are too weak, bleak, and unnecessary.  (And I still suspect that her Oscar winning was a fluke.)THE MOST REGRETTABLE PART OF THE FILM is its ending, or how it comes to there.  Again, we see a familiar plot device -- gun.  After the very emotionally intense and spellbinding scenes, the film allows the B-Hollywood action film clithes to creep into the situation, and blows up the credible tone completely.  The film director (and first-time at that) Vadim Perelman really wanted a tradegy, so HE creates one, disregarding consistency.

801416,A3POUK5BO810DD,B0001DMVBC,T. Wu,"[3, 14]","First of all let me say that the acting in this film was superb. Each of the main characters was played extremely well.The main reason I dislike this film is how extremely, almost gratutiously sad and depressing it is. Of course, I suffer from depression and was unaware of what it would be like before putting it into the DVD player, and it certainly did not help my condition. But movies are entertainment, and I do not believe it takes a depressed person to appreciate film that has at least some positive redeeming quality to be found somewhere within it, even if every movie cannot be like as delightful as a well-made romantic comedy. I failed to find that here.Some reviewers have noted that the plot seemed to be forced, and I agree. To push the situation to its conclusion, the scriptwriters seem to have written in decisions by characters that seemed to be more irrational and crass than would be realistic. Other reviewers have noted potential themes in this film, such as keeping in mind what is ""important in life"" more than materialism. A close review of the plot I believe, seems to dispute this as being the main theme. The deepest problems presented and the most unfortunate hinges in the storyline do not derive from the characters' excessive materialism, but rather a combination of the characters themselves and the scriptwriters' forcefully pulling things along.I must also mention that I am a first-generation immigrant American; my family arrived in this country about 20 years ago, and in our first years here we rented in the home of an American couple. This family taught us by far most of we came to learn about American culture and manners, very much on everyday matters such as how to buy a car and navigate the financial system, spent much effort teaching us English, and generally shared their lives with us. They remain close friends to this day. Of course, each experience is different, but simply put, and our experience could not be more different than what is portrayed in this film. Discrimination against immigrants certain exists, but in many ways it seems to be more legal and institutional than personal. The extremely vicious anti-Americanism that seems to underlie the atmosphere of this film seems inaccurate (and potentially offensive). (It is also true that most immigrant families were not members of the nobility in their home countries, who held celebrations in lavish palaces; the standard of living in the home country is usually inferior, or else why immigrate?)But mainly I only give House of Sand and Fog two stars because, having seen, reseen, and thought about the film, I can find no justification for what is one of the most relentlessly depressing and tragic tales to emerge in recent years. More often than not, it seemed as if the characters were punished specifically for positive actions than rewarded. The only star is for the acting (and because one star is best reserved for carelessly made trash films).",2,What is this film about?,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,2970,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'superb', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'played', 'extremely', 'well.The', 'main', 'reason', 'dislike', 'film', 'how', 'extremely', 'almost', 'gratutiously', 'sad', 'depressing', 'course', 'suffer', 'depression', 'was', 'unaware', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'putting', 'DVD', 'player', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'condition', 'movies', 'are', 'entertainment', 'do', 'not', 'believe', 'depressed', 'person', 'appreciate', 'film', 'least', 'positive', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'be', 'found', 'somewhere', 'even', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'delightful', 'well-made', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'failed', 'find', 'here.Some', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'plot', 'seemed', 'be', 'forced', 'agree', 'push', 'situation', 'conclusion', 'scriptwriters', 'seem', 'have', 'written', 'decisions', 'characters', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'irrational', 'crass', 'would', 'be', 'realistic', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'potential', 'themes', 'film', 'such', 'keeping', 'mind', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'more', 'materialism', 'A', 'close', 'review', 'plot', 'believe', 'dispute', 'being', 'main', 'theme', 'deepest', 'problems', 'presented', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'hinges', 'storyline', 'do', 'not', 'derive', 'characters', 'excessive', 'materialism', 'rather', 'combination', 'characters', 'scriptwriters', 'forcefully', 'pulling', 'things', 'along.I', 'must', 'also', 'mention', 'am', 'first-generation', 'immigrant', 'American', 'family', 'arrived', 'country', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'first', 'years', 'here', 'rented', 'home', 'American', 'couple', 'family', 'taught', 'far', 'most', 'came', 'learn', 'American', 'culture', 'manners', 'very', 'much', 'everyday', 'matters', 'such', 'how', 'buy', 'car', 'navigate', 'financial', 'system', 'spent', 'much', 'effort', 'teaching', 'English', 'generally', 'shared', 'lives', 'remain', 'close', 'friends', 'day', 'course', 'experience', 'different', 'simply', 'put', 'experience', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'what', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Discrimination', 'immigrants', 'certain', 'exists', 'many', 'ways', 'be', 'more', 'legal', 'institutional', 'personal', 'extremely', 'vicious', 'anti-Americanism', 'underlie', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'inaccurate', 'potentially', 'offensive', 'also', 'true', 'most', 'immigrant', 'families', 'were', 'not', 'members', 'nobility', 'home', 'countries', 'who', 'held', 'celebrations', 'lavish', 'palaces', 'standard', 'living', 'home', 'country', 'usually', 'inferior', 'else', 'why', 'immigrate', 'mainly', 'only', 'give', 'House', 'Sand', 'Fog', 'two', 'stars', 'having', 'seen', 'reseen', 'thought', 'film', 'can', 'find', 'justification', 'what', 'one', 'most', 'relentlessly', 'depressing', 'tragic', 'tales', 'emerge', 'recent', 'years', 'More', 'often', 'not', 'seemed', 'characters', 'were', 'punished', 'specifically', 'positive', 'actions', 'rewarded', 'only', 'star', 'acting', 'one', 'star', 'best', 'reserved', 'carelessly', 'made', 'trash', 'films']",N/A

801420,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B0001DMVBC,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[12, 12]","If you can take extreme sadness and tragedy then you'll love ""House of Sand and Fog,"" a powerful drama from first-time director Vadim Perelman.It's about a fight, basically.  A verbal, psychological, and, eventually, physical fight over a house that is needed desparately by two people: Kathy Nicolo (Jennifer Conally), who is wrongly evicted from her dead father's home (passed down to her) after failing to pay taxes that she shouldn't have been charged for in the first place; and Mr. Behrani (Ben Kingsley), a former Colonal from Iran who fled his country with his wife, Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo), and teenage son.  And as they fight ruthlessly over the home, a third person comes into the picture: a man named Lester (Ron Eldard), a person left empty in an unhappy relaitionship wanting to find true love.  And he finds this in Kathy, and will stop at nothing to get the house back for her (in an attempt to completely win her over).  Ethics, law, and (most importantly) culture play into the story that all falls into a pit of despair and sadness.What's best about the film is the acting.  Kingsley is incredibly convincing and makes every bit of his storyline and personality ultimately real.  Conally, also, makes her emotions and life seem disturbingly (and sadly) realistic.  Both were so good, in fact, that they equally deserve nominations for this year's Acadamy Awards.But the one performer who most deserves an Oscar is Shohreh Aghdashloo, an actress unknown to us in America (she is famous in Iran, apparantly).  She steals every scene she's in, such as the silent, awkward feeling of being in a room with Kathy or her pain and suffering over Behrani's bad decisions.  You can feel her emotion run through your body and out your eyes in the form of tears, tears of pity.  And that is her advantage for the Oscars this year (hopefully).  She is the one character anyone can sympathize for in every situation.  She does nothing wrong, and must sit and watch everything around her fall apart, a helpless feeling I'm sure no one ever wants to feel.  She was truly amazing.The director, Vadim Perelman, swoops into the entertainment scene with an amazing debut, a la Todd Field in 2001 with his first movie, ""In the Bedroom.""  Actually, that film and this one are connected in backstory: They are both based off of prose written by someone from the Dubus family line.  If you see this, there's no doubt you'll be watching out for him.  He's an obvious talent, making a tragic story such as this all the more effective.I must also point out two technical aspects of the film: the score and cinematography.  The score is the best I've heard all year.  It is obviously inspired from both cultures portrayed in the movie, and adds tension and emotion where needed.  The cinematography is, in a word, mesmerizing (sp?).  There are constant shots of fog and ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge that come off as beautiful, but dark, perfectly expressing the tone of the film.  One shot that stayed with me throughout was of a stone birdbath filled with green, murky water with nothing but a white feather floating calmly in its center.  Words can't express what it made me feel.  It was, simply, haunting.So the bottom line is that you'll enjoy this if you appreciate great acting, a powerful story, and can take tragedy after tragedy after tragedy, something the critics found over-the-top.  But if you add everything up towards the end and have a pretty good understanding of backrounds and both cultures viewed from both POV's in the film, then you'll find it logical and purely powerful.

801421,A17JVVAKWEB0M,B0001DMVBC,Wesley Mullins,"[1, 3]","Seldom does a casting director find better choices for leads in a film than Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley.  They perfectly capture the essence of the characters so richly detailed in the Dubus novel.As in life, the conflict in The House of Sand and Fog is not the product of good and evil. Rather, disagreement grows between two well-meaning characters whose goals in life can't co-exist. The two main figures, Kathy and Behrani, both lay claim to a house. Each views themselves as righteous and the other as evil (and both are correct from their own point of view). Viewers toggle between the two, as both are sympathetic and both have noble, honest intentions. Kathy loses her home when the tax office makes a mistake and seizes it from her. Behrani buys the house at an auction and re-invents his family's life in the little bungalow. Selling it back to Kathy at the tax office's price would cause him to lose considerable time and investment on the property.The film moves freely between the two characters, with each acting as hero during their ""turn"" and then being relegated to villain when the other character picks up the narrative.  The film's one fault is its inability to explore the minds of each character.  In the book, the novel was told from the first person point of view of Kathy and Behrani.  This allowed Behrani to discuss his history as an Iranian immigrant and Kathy to talk about her life as a recovering addict.  Without a voice-over narration, all this information is lost.As with the novel, the film's greatest strength is its depiction of the ambiguous nature of ""being right"". If the film were only Kathy's tale, Behrani would be a Mr. Potter-like capitalist demon, while Behrani's version would depict Kathy as a lazy, irresponsible and illogical American, consistent with those most immigrants encounter after moving to the USA and expecting to see Gary Cooper and June Cleaver in every home. Since both characters are sympathetic, the result creates conflict in the viewer. Who's right? Who should get the house? And at what cost?The rich characters provide a compelling inspection of the nature of human conflict (and a pretty good crash course in real estate foreclosure bureaucracy). After the conflict is established, however, the film becomes a bit too focuses on action and physical drama and goes on a bit too long.

Instead of thrills or amusement, House of S&F; offers the chance to see two actors at their very best, and to catch an extraordinary talent at the beginning of his directing career.  I think both Kingsley and Connelly deserve Oscar consideration for their work here, and it's hard to believe Vadim Perelman is a first-time director.  He has shaped such a remarkably subtle and powerful film.Other reviewers have already done a good job of telling about the film's arc toward its tragic conclusion.  There is one frustrating and significant moment when things could have turned out better (perhaps), but they only get worse.  Rather than repeat what others have said, let me comment on a few less obvious aspects of House of S&F;'s greatness.  The characters are all very honest with each other, even when facing devastating consequences.  I felt that was rare in a modern movie.  The drama builds in a careful way that's essentially free of Hollywood cliches.  The subtle touches are prevalent in the story, the visuals, and even the understated and effective score by James Horner.  It all makes the conclusion hit even harder.I already watch for movies by Connelly and Kingsley (a different ""Benifer"" acting combo)- now I will add Mr. Perelman to the ""must see"" list.",5,Film of Power and Dread,1072915200,"01 1, 2004",2004,1369,"['Only', 'see', 'movie', 'can', 'handle', 'tragedy', 'do', 'see', 'appreciate', 'strong', 'film-making', 'Instead', 'thrills', 'amusement', 'House', 'S', 'F', 'chance', 'see', 'two', 'actors', 'very', 'best', 'catch', 'extraordinary', 'talent', 'beginning', 'directing', 'career', 'think', 'Kingsley', 'Connelly', 'deserve', 'Oscar', 'consideration', 'work', 'here', 'hard', 'believe', 'Vadim', 'Perelman', 'first-time', 'director', 'shaped', 'remarkably', 'subtle', 'powerful', 'film.Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'good', 'job', 'telling', 'film', 'arc', 'tragic', 'conclusion', 'one', 'frustrating', 'significant', 'moment', 'when', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'perhaps', 'only', 'get', 'worse', 'Rather', 'repeat', 'what', 'others', 'have', 'said', 'let', 'comment', 'few', 'less', 'obvious', 'aspects', 'House', 'S', 'F', 'greatness', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'honest', 'other', 'even', 'when', 'facing', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'felt', 'was', 'rare', 'modern', 'movie', 'drama', 'careful', 'way', 'essentially', 'free', 'Hollywood', 'cliches', 'subtle', 'touches', 'are', 'prevalent', 'story', 'visuals', 'even', 'understated', 'effective', 'score', 'James', 'Horner', 'conclusion', 'hit', 'even', 'harder.I', 'already', 'watch', 'movies', 'Connelly', 'Kingsley', 'different', 'Benifer', 'acting', 'combo', 'now', 'will', 'add', 'Mr.', 'Perelman', 'must', 'see', 'list']",N/A

In a way it's a horror film, because people go crazy trying to get the house surrounded by sand and fog on the beach in the middle of nowhere. The characters gone mad to the point of murder and suicide. So what? It's a junky old house. What's so special about it?Jennifer Connelley is impressive as an recovering alcoholic driven to the point of nervous breakdown and suicide by the ruthless Ben Kinskey after losing her inherited house. the battle to regain her house would eventually cause both vivals to do some really bad things, and the son and wife of Kinskey became the victim of this ferious surcumstance.It's a pretty heavy movie to watch, because it's a aweful tragedy. It's really worthwhile to see the performances from the leads, especially the Iranian actress Shohreh Agdashloo. I was so disappointed that she had lost the Oscar to Renee Zellwegger, because her performance in this movie is stunning. She stole scenes from Connelly and Kinskey! I had never seen her before, because she had done mostly theatre in Europe. I really enjoyed her bilingual performance. Her character was the angel in the war between her husband(Kinskey) and Connelly. She had to sacrifice her life to make peace, unfortunately things had gotten to the point the point of no return.
