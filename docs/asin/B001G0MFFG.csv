This show gleefully shatters taboos you hadn't even realized existed.Let me say right here that I don't think offensiveness is funny just because it's offensive. That's lazy humor, and it's boring. This humor is funny because it's brilliantly well written, it offers a joke about every 15 seconds, it's character-driven, and the comedy springs from its premise: A parody of the kinds of ""reality show"" that put dysfunctional people together in the same living quarters and watch them fight, act out, and drive each other crazy. I hate those kinds of shows, but I love Drawn Together. Unlike those reality shows, it somehow retains its humanity and even some sense of compassion for the insane characters.Go figure.

1192589,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B001G0MFFG,Micheal Hunt,"[6, 8]","In the rise of popularity of adult orientated cartoons like South Park, the hunt was on to find more shows like it in the attempt that someone would hit gold and out-do Trey and Matt. Even The Simspons attempted some more adult orientated shows there for a while. But not all of them succeeded, instead they just found small cult followings. But Drawn Together hit the nail on the head right away. With Big Brother being a current pop-culture hit, it was only a matter of time before someone made fun of it. That's where Drawn Together brought in a house of different contestants in this whacky and outrageous reality-TV show parody.The main characters of the show are a Super-Man-like man named Captain Hero, who not only is not all that courageous at times and is also battling his own Sexuality. He likes to use his super-powers of being able to fly and have laser vision, as well as try and hump everything on two legs, whether they work or not.Then there is Clara who is a Disney-Like princess, who has been a little sheltered in her posh royal upbringing, and doesn't seem to always know how to be politically correct all the time. She also has her quirks and a few surprises up her...umm... dress.Then there is Toot. Who is a Betty-Boop-like woman, who has seen her best days gone a way a long time ago. She is a gross overweight pig who, like Captain Hero, also doesn't like to hold back her hormones at times.Xander is a queer Zelda-like video game character who in the beginning is always saying he is on a never ending quest to save his girlfriend, only to discover his true sexuality. He also has many lives and dies quite a few times in the show, but not quite a rip off of Kenny tho.Spanky Ham is a favorite character. He is one of those toons that showed up online in spam adverts. He is a rough, sleazy, horny little pig who... yeah, I guess they all pretty much have that quirk.Ling Ling is a Pokemon-like thing who doesn't speak English, least not well. Mostly when he speaks it is subtitled. He is kinda cute, and always either getting sad or angry and wanting to do battle with someone.Foxxy Love is a Josie and The Pussy Cats kind of thing. Sometimes she also reminds me of someone who never was, but should have been in Scooby Doo. She is a strong opinionated black woman, and she will open a can of whoopie on your butt if you mess with her. She also likes to party and make out with Clara from time to time.And finally there is Wooldart. An annoying Sponge-Bob-like character who is the looniest of them all. Not too bright at times, but always does something stupid enough to make the viewers laugh.Taking all of these characters and combining them into the same house, it makes a hilarious combination of misfit cartoons of different types to come together and see how they would get along. Each episode is often nothing like the last one, sometimes it might be the house game show, sometimes it might just consist of them doing their own things, or finding trouble, love, hate etc...In the DVD package you get seasons 1, 2 & 3 as well as the movie. Unfortunately my Australian release of this did not come with the game board, but I don't mind, I probably never would have played it anyway. The DVD's do have extra features such as ""making-ofs"", ""interviews"", ""audio commentaries"" and a few other things. Note: there is no closed captions/subtitles.",5,It's a shame there was only 3 seasons and a movie.

1192590,A1WMCX4CYZCYXE,B001G0MFFG,Mike,"[17, 22]","The show is about a ""Cartoon Reality Show"". Various character archetypes from reality shows e.g. Captain Hero (the Superman character), the Princess (the Disney Princess character) and misc cartoons live together in a house. Outlandish hijinks ensue that often poke fun at real-life stereotypes (e.g. Ling-Ling, the ""pikachu"" character speaks ""Engrish"") and cartoon cliches (i.e. Captain Hero reads his own origin story). And of course, as mentioned raunchy hijinks necessarily ensue.This is a low-brow (no political or social commentary like South Park), but funny show with lots of scatological humor, pop culture references, and a ridiculously over-the top nature. If you like over the top slapstick and scatological humor, you'll like this show.If you're in college, the board game set included is also pretty nice, and the special features include a ""milk"" drinking game. If I was 10 years younger, I'd probably think it was amazing.Recommended if you like Tripping the Rift (the humor is fairly similar) or South Park.*Just a warning - if you're easily offended don't watch this show. It makes South Park look like Barney the Purple Dinosaur by comparison. It really is probably the most offensive thing I've ever seen on TV. At some point, every human being will be offended by something on it.It kind of reminds me of Fritz the Cat, except funnier. They explore every possible stereotype regarding race, religion, and orientation humanly possible. There are also plenty of graphic discussions and depictions of sex and nudity. This show is the kind of thing that would give the PMRC nightmares. I'd watch an episode on comedy central's website before purchasing.

This show pretty much crosses the line on everything that is good and pure in this world. It is rauncher than Jackass, grosser that Fear Factor, goofier than Flavor of Love and pretty much more amazing than anything you will ever see on television. Each joke makes you laugh until your sides hurt, the uncensored verson on these dvds will shock you so much your jaw will drop all the way down to the Earths core. The pop culture references of television, reality television and various animation companies will make laugh so hard you will do things I can't even say on this web site. What I can say is this is a must see show for anyone from super avengelical to devil worshipers. Get all three seasons in all their gut busting and gut wrenching glory, beleive me it is so worth it!
