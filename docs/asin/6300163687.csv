My parents and I were always turned off by foul language and such, but this was the exception. I remember my dad, who rarely cracked up, hanging over his chair in hysterics, mom quoting it weeks later, and me remembering lines  all these years after. He jokes about Judaism (he was Jewish), having a barium enema at a Vegas hospital, has the audience losing it as he tries to get a respectable audience member to say dirty words, and interacts with a man in the audience about impotence. I loved how the man's wife gets on him for talking about it on TV! Be warned, this is not for kids! The fish story, no, you won't want kids to hear that either, and the punchline is very 70s/80s and might go over the heads of people who weren't around then and the punchline is what makes it. Rarely do you find a person who is outright potty mouthed but you don't really mind because he's funny and cute in a goofy way. If you have a friend who is always wound up, looking for something to be offended by, don't show them this!

When DVDs came out, I looked and even wrote snail mail letters to HBO, never hearing back. After GOOGLE came along, I only found others also searching. Then finally, my search said Amazon had it! I bought it and eagerly waited. I had built it up so much, I wondered if it would still be as terrific as I remembered, and it WAS! Sure it looks like the 80's! It was, and that just adds to the hilarity. Some will find Buddy's words offensive (that is even part of the performance) but this is classic Buddy Hackett and it is so funny, I cry laughing, every time.
