The director and production company obviously have talent and know how to put a film together.  The actors are mostly unknown, but are very convincing.  The one gripe I have is the story is not very original, but in this day of multi-million dollar Hollywood cookie cutter films, originality is hard to come by either way.  While the plot is not original I will say the scripting is well done.  This movie works, is scary, and if you are a zombie fan, then Severed is well worth your time.",4,Zombie Survivalist Horror Done Well,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,549,"['Severed', 'very', 'definition', 'good', 'low', 'budget', 'movie', 'director', 'production', 'company', 'obviously', 'have', 'talent', 'know', 'how', 'put', 'film', 'together', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'are', 'very', 'convincing', 'one', 'gripe', 'have', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'original', 'day', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'Hollywood', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'films', 'originality', 'hard', 'come', 'way', 'plot', 'not', 'original', 'will', 'say', 'scripting', 'well', 'done', 'movie', 'scary', 'are', 'zombie', 'fan', 'then', 'Severed', 'well', 'time']",Severed: Forest of the Dead
994205,A1EK0KJ1LLQB7L,B000FQISUS,Amazon Customer,"[5, 6]","""Severed"" is an okay low budget Canadian zombie movie that gets better as it goes along.  The standard bioenginneered rogue chemical compound thingy, designed as a growth hormone for trees, instead creates zombies that terrorize both lumberjacks and protestors in a remote logging camp.  The first fifteen or twenty minutes are a bit slow, but once the zombie action starts, it actually gets pretty involving.  Lots of blood, but not actually as gory as other zombie movies you've probably seen.  The acting is uneven, but then the actors are frequently required to deliver some pretty bad dialogue, Sarah Lind, as one of the protestors, in particular.  Paul Campbell, who plays the son of a corporate executive sent to check out the camp, actually makes the best impression with his role.  The zombies, while effectively used in some scenes, are a bit of a liability.  They seem impossibly slow and awkward, to the point where you start to wonder why the heroes don't just stay in place and then just conk the zombies on the heads when they get close.  Also, it's not completely clear how the zombie infection is passed.  It seems to be through a bite or an open wound, but there are a number of scenes where the heroes get soaked with blood beating down a zombie.  Why didn't they get infected?  All in all, though, a pretty decent low budget zombie flick.  I even liked the end, which goes in an unexpected direction.",3,Gets Better As It Goes Along,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,1420,"['Severed', 'okay', 'low', 'budget', 'Canadian', 'zombie', 'movie', 'better', 'along', 'standard', 'bioenginneered', 'rogue', 'chemical', 'compound', 'thingy', 'designed', 'growth', 'hormone', 'trees', 'instead', 'zombies', 'terrorize', 'lumberjacks', 'protestors', 'remote', 'logging', 'camp', 'first', 'fifteen', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'are', 'bit', 'slow', 'once', 'zombie', 'action', 'actually', 'pretty', 'involving', 'Lots', 'blood', 'not', 'actually', 'as', 'gory', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'seen', 'acting', 'uneven', 'then', 'actors', 'are', 'frequently', 'required', 'deliver', 'pretty', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'Sarah', 'Lind', 'one', 'protestors', 'particular', 'Paul', 'Campbell', 'who', 'son', 'corporate', 'executive', 'sent', 'check', 'out', 'camp', 'actually', 'best', 'impression', 'role', 'zombies', 'effectively', 'used', 'scenes', 'are', 'bit', 'liability', 'seem', 'impossibly', 'slow', 'awkward', 'point', 'where', 'start', 'wonder', 'why', 'heroes', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'stay', 'place', 'then', 'just', 'conk', 'zombies', 'heads', 'when', 'get', 'close', 'Also', 'not', 'completely', 'clear', 'how', 'zombie', 'infection', 'passed', 'be', 'bite', 'open', 'wound', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'where', 'heroes', 'get', 'soaked', 'blood', 'beating', 'down', 'zombie', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'infected', 'though', 'pretty', 'decent', 'low', 'budget', 'zombie', 'flick', 'even', 'liked', 'end', 'unexpected', 'direction']",Severed: Forest of the Dead

994207,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B000FQISUS,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Severed: Forest of the Dead tells the story of a lumberjack who is injured when cutting a tree which has genetically modified tree sap, causing him to turn into a zombie. Wherein, loggers and environmental activists must join together in order to survive against zombies resulting from the logging company's genetic experiments in an attempt to increase lumber production. Far fetched story, I know, but- believe it or not- it actually works in this movie. The zombies in the film move like your typical zombie does, but their appearance is different. Instead of having a pale white bloodless skin tone, many of the zombies have a yellow discoloration about them and sport dark veins along the side of their head.One of the thing that I love about this movie is the fact that, although the story is a bit far-fetched, they're trying something new and going with  it. By playing it seriously, they make the story believable. For a low-budgeter, it was surprisingly good. Good enough for me to give it four stars, which means I like it!When all is said and done, though, you'll see Severed: Forest of the Dead is one of the better zombie movies out there. Most of the ones that I've seen lately have left alot to be desired from them. That's why, if you've been keeping up with my reviews, I've slowed down with reviews for them.

When it comes to this movie, the fact that the word mental is in environmentalist is not ironic.  They fight a lost cause, and want everyone to live in tee-pees.  Their method of obstruction is quite typical: chants, signs, chaining oneself to a tree.  Although, they participate in a more dastardly practice as well, ""spiking"" trees (whatever that is)!The story transitions masterfully out of the forest and into the boardroom, where a Chairman of the Board (naturally) at a logging company is sitting with his boot-licking sycophants, listening to a report detailing the advancements in agricultural science and the bottom-line impact of experimental tree sap injections - very compelling stuff.  This bigwig has a son who he'd like to see follow in the family footsteps; and despite his Willy Loman failures as a father and mentor, he's willing to side with nepotism and let his son, who was late to the meeting, take on the huge responsibility of figuring out what has gone wrong at one of their logging locations.The plot thickens.  I think you see where this is going.Paul Campbell, who plays the C.O.T.B.'s son, Tyler, delivers a convincing and compelling performance as the dim-witted, silver-spoon son sent in to uncover the logging mystery, and fight off the menacing zombies.  What he finds is a forest deluged with both terrorists, I mean hippies, I mean environmentalists, and loggers, all infected by the aforementioned Bunsen burner creation, which, evidently, causes zombieism.As a side note, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that zombieism is very easy to diagnose throughout the movie, further displaying the range all zombie-playing actors exhibited.  Zombieism causes insatiable hunger, retardation, superhuman strength, pervasive jaundice, raging pink eye, and a slight case of cerebral palsy.Anyway, Tyler meets up with Mac, played by Julian Christopher, the deep-thinking, over-protective supervisor of the logging site.  Christopher plays the father figure to perfection, tugging on heartstrings with every provocative utterance.  Along with Tyler and Mac is a motley crew of survivors, most notably is Rita, played by Sarah Lind.

Judging by hollywoods latest attempts at making zombie movies I wasn't all that thrilled going into this one.  I'd all but given up on any hope of any more good zombie pictures being made any time soon.  I figured since ""Lions Gate"" & ""Anchorbay"" had raped, stomped & shat all over what little new hype that'd been sparked for the genre that we'd be waiting another 10 to 20 years for someone to care enough to write another descent script like ""Shaun"", ""28"", ""Undead"", or ""Land"".Well, I'm pleased to let all you zombie fans out there know that this one's actually a pretty good one.  I'll admit, there are still some plot holes, but all & all this one's a keeper.  Ghoul make up & effects are spot on, although everytime some one would get eaten or really chewed up in a violent way it would tend to happen off camera(that was a little annoying if you really pay attention to it).  Don't get me wrong though the movie is still plenty bloody/gory, you just didn't get to see the initial impact, just blood & guts spraying everywhere.  The acting is also well done(except for the horrendously bad acting coming from the butch asian chick, I saw her in ""Vampire Wars too, how is this woman getting work, she's horrible?).  Don't get me wrong, ""Severed"" isn't without it's flaws, it's definately not a Romero movie.  At the same time though, this is gonna seem like ""Empire Strikes Back"" compared to ""Return 4"", ""HOTD 1 & 2"", ""Zombiez"", ""DOTD 2""...  you get the picture.

So there is no rescue party coming and everyone is truly on there own.

994224,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B000FQISUS,Joker,"[1, 1]","Severed: Forest Of The Dead (2005) is a low budget B zombie splatter movie that takes elements of past zombie movies and mixes them together to create its own unique feel.  Once in a great while I like to watch zombie movies and zombie splatter movies.  These types of movies are fun to watch simply because they usually have a thin plot, are visually entertaining (gorey) and even funny to a certain extent.  This movie is a perfect example.The plot basically is this:  A logging company is genetically altering trees in hopes of increasing lumber production.  A group of environmental activists and the loggers clash with their opposing views on logging and the environment.  At one point a lumberjack gets injured while he's using a chain saw while cutting a tree that has been tree spiked by the environmentalists.  The tree sap, which has been genetically modified, causes him to turn into a zombie.  Soon all hell breaks loose as this group of environmental activists and loggers become infected by zombies and turn into zombies themselves.  The environmentalists and the loggers must work together to survive the infestation of zombies.This movie's camerawork is horrendous.  It's very shakey for most of the movie.  It reminds me of camcorder movies like The Blair Witch Project, The Last Exorcism, and Paranormal Activity.  My rating of this movie took a hit because of this alone.  If it wasn't for this, then I'd rate this an average zombie movie, which would be 3 stars.The forest where this movie takes place provides pretty good atmosphere and there is lots of blood and gore.  But as with most zombie movies, the plot is thin and rather ridiculous.  When you're dealing with zombies, the plot almost HAS to be silly, because zombies themselves are creatures that are on the silly side.Overall, this is about what I expected from a B zombie splatter movie.

994225,AIIR8E34EDKCQ,B000FQISUS,- Kasia S.,"[18, 21]","Forests remind me of oceans for they cover such a vast part of our planet yet we know so little about everything that goes on in them. Hidden species lurk in deep trees and slither at night as scientists only scratch the surface of the life on this planet, a life as we know of today, being a blink of an eye in the total life span of planet Earth, filed with wonders and apparently even zombies!Severed is a very interesting movie, one I have never heard of before but as it caught my curiosity and I was in the mood for some ooey gooey horror I decided to give it a go. I have always loved forests and growing up in Europe as a kid I enjoyed many sun filled days and some nice camping, but a few more movies such as this one and I don't know if I will ever see them the same way again. Zombie movies make me think of malls and shopping centers, as hazard, death and destruction are in crowded areas, where the surviving group cans plumage through sporting good stores, cafes and sleep in furniture stores as they try to escape that darn flesh obsessed Zombies. This movie is different, because all you see is trees and more trees and there are no hotels and log cabins, no supermarkets and no save havens where one can get his strength and sanity recovered long enough to survive. Severed is filled with hungry, realistic looking zombies that jump out from the most innocent looking tree patches and who are quite relentless in their pursuit of the next warm meal.In a nutshell this movie is pretty simple, there is some bio engineering which is meant to turn tree cutting into a lucrative business for one man, who upon losing contact with his working crew sends his son Tyler to personally check out the situation, to a remote place, accessible by a ferry and requiring a long drive though dark, creepy woods. Unknowns to anyone there is an accident which causes infection spread from the engineered trees to one of the workers, who in classic Zombie fashion can't resist lunching on his fellow friends, turning a whole crowd of lumberjacks into fearless walking corpses. Combine that with a group of activists who protested tree cutting in the same area and you have a goulash of opposing sides who hate one another reunited in the same pursuit of flesh once bitten and changed and who pose a real threat on Tyler. When I was watching this movie I knew the slim chances the characters had of making out alive and I loved the twists and surprises when people who looked safe suddenly transformed and betrayed their friends and it reminded me of 28 Days Later, with the shaky and realistic camera work but it was just as gruesome and still felt fresh.What I liked about Severed was the lack of Hollywood and pretentiousness which are big horror movie spoilers; where editing and trying to appeal to a wide audience ruins many movies. Horror is horror, not something I think kids over 13 should be able to see so the movie studio can lower the pg rating and therefore slash the gore and scares. I felt this movie stayed true to what the director wanted it to be and even though on a budget I enjoyed it. The best part was the bittersweet ending, something I didn't see coming, as I felt it made the movie a rewarding experience to watch. Sure this is not Oscar material but it provided an afternoon of thrills and chills as I love random campy horrors and I still like the woods, as long as they are not booby trapped with lumberjack zombies.

994227,A1H89KJ9KF1SB9,B000FQISUS,"Kody Boye ""Horror Author""","[1, 2]","In a perfectly-loving, fascinating and carefree world, zombie fans would be able to enjoy any and all zombie movies that are made.Sadly, we do not live in a perfect, loving world, and thus must deal with the atrocities that befall us.In SEVERED: FOREST OF THE DEAD we are introduced to a simple idea--zombies in a forest. Yes, I said zombies in a forest. While this might seem fascinating upon first glance, it's only when you start cutting into the meat of the movie that you're exposed to the grisly, burnt fat beneath.Beginning with a group of environmentalists protesting the destruction of the forest, we are soon introduced to a tree cutter named Mac. In charge of a small group of individuals hellbent on destroying the environment, we watch a few brief events unfold--Mac talking to a man we will soon come to know as Curtis, watching a group of men talk amongst one another, then watching a man cut in the tree, all the while unaware of a juicy sap that is dripping from its interior.One false--and possibly set-up--move and the treecutter slips.His chainsaw goes into his shoulder.Within minutes, he becomes one of the dead.Now... had I enjoyed this movie (or at least thought it was worth watching,) I would have gone on to explain that the corporation owner's son is sent into the forest to figure out why production was delayed, as well as the eventual trap he falls into. But since I didn't enjoy this movie, I'll delve into the specifics of why SEVERED: FOREST OF THE DEAD is a zombie film I don't recommend watching.- The first major flaw that forewarned of the horror (pun intended) that was to follow was the scene in which the two environmentalists and the main character are trying to free the red-coat girl's boyfriend. While another environmentalist is screaming for her life whilst slowly being advanced upon by zombies, both of the girls who accompany the main character do nothing but scream for him to 'hurry up' while he tries to free red coat's boyfriend. As far as I saw, they had more than just an axe to possibly free him, but added to the fact that an axe probably wouldn't have cut through metal chains that quickly anyway, the girls simply scream in terror as their friend is eaten alive.- The repeated slow-motion deaths. I can understand why these would be used if they were actually necessary to some key point, but I counted this same usage at least four times without any necessary reason. Sure, it might look cool to see someone kill a zombie in slow-mo, but not several times in a row.- The film's mythology (i.e, affects of being bitten by a zombie) fall miserably low, often to the point of complete failure. Red coat is, as far as I saw, bitten, but does not turn into a zombie throughout the entire movie, nor is her boyfriend turned into hours later, when it was evident from the very beginning that one slight wound could turn you in seconds.- Another major thing about the movie is the lack of empathy the viewer feels toward the characters, specifically Carter. From the moment we meet him, the company scientist is probably the biggest and most self-absorbed baby I have ever seen in any film. He goes from point to point, acting like a bipolar schizophrenic by either A) Pleading for people to help him, or B) Making irrational, brass-balled decisions (which, judging by his 'solid' character, he has none.) At one point, he even grabs onto a zombie's arm while he's being bitten. Added to the fact that at the end of the movie, he experiences blood-filled-balls syndrome and leaves, letting zombies into an encampment, he screams for someone to 'help him' after he himself has fled the camp. You feel no empathy toward his character. He serves no point other than to serve as a catalyst for the next stupid thing that's going to happen.- In the middle of the movie (when the group of now-four happens upon a radio relay tower,) Mac takes seemingly the longest time to get there, when it is initially made obvious (or so it seems) that the radio tower is close to the location's gate. Along with this, the main character magically finds food in a fridge that has had no power in it, specifically sandwiches. Really? Come on--no one's that stupid. Food doesn't just magically appear out of thin air.- The special affects aren't something to be envied either. A zombie gets shot in the head with a shotgun, a hole appears. Last I recall, the physical aspects of bullet meet skull don't work that way.- Near the end of the movie, red-coat and main character start their own little love affair, after red coat's boyfriend had his zombified head chainsawed off no more than a day or so before. I don't think I need to elaborate.In a nutshell, SEVERED: FOREST OF THE DEAD suffers from (the condensed version):- Unrealistic character development and lack of emotional attraction- Lousy affects- A dues ex machina-styled ending- A horrible story- And at least two unresolved plotsI wanted to enjoy this movie--I really, truly did, as I've been waiting months to see it. If there were even the slightest chance of any redeeming qualities, I would at least feel a little justified (and even better) at having watched it. Sadly, though, I shut the film off at the least five minutes of the film (I'm surprised I even made it that far, as I wanted to shut it off a half-hour into the film.)For fans of the zombie universe, I would not recommend turning to Severed: Forest of the Dead.My brutal, honest opinion: this film is a disgrace to the genre, an abomination to the likely-talented actors, and an atrocity set upon unsuspecting zombie fans who may be lured in by the over-idealized three, four and five-star reviews.",1,Severed...

994229,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000FQISUS,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[4, 8]","""Severed"" has all of the ingredients required for a zombie movie.  Something turns one person into zombie, at which point biting another person turns them into a zombie, and the next thing you know there are a whole bunch of zombies.  You have people thrown together by circumstances who have to get out of there, but some of them are going to get bit (see previous point), and not all of them are going to get out of there alive.  This has been true of what we would not have to qualify as the modern zombie film, which dates back to George A. Romero's original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" which changed everything from the old fashioned voodoo inspired zombies of ""White Zombie"" with Bela Lugosi.  ""Severed"" fits the pattern just like ""28 Days Later,"" ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Dead and Breakfast,"" and whatever other zombie movies you have seen recently.What is different about this one is primarily that it takes place in a forest instead of a city, so instead of around the corner or behind the window, this time there could be a zombie around the next tree.  There is a point early on when the uninfected humans are gathered in a rickety old shack in the middle of the woods, but that does not last long and we are back to running through the woods.  You might ask how come there are so many people running around in the forest to be turned into zombies, and that is because there are not only all these loggers cutting down trees, there are environmental protesters running around as well.  So not only do you have two groups that are not disposed to like each other, the ante is up because the tree huggers have been spiking trees (which ironically ends up being the precipitous event), and it turns out the forestry company has been messing around with a secret formula, GX1134, which makes old growth forests grow three times faster.  However, since the music takes an ominous turn when one of the company's scientists notes he has never seen sap like this before, it turns out that this was not such a good idea.  Besides, since this is a zombie movie set in a forest that means (wait for it) chainsaws!Director Carl Bessai provide plenty of gore, but actually shows some sensitivity in that when the zombies get one of our little band of potential survivors, who then has to be put out of their misery, we might see the jets of blood spraying people, but not what the axe (or chainsaw) is doing to the zombie.  The problems, as always, come more from the story line, because even though the CEO of the company has sent his son into the forest to find out why the logging operation has stopped, the greedy corporation decides to close off the entire forest once they find out zombies are running through the woods (it is not clear if they think one day the zombies will be dead or whether they really are writing off this forest for the rest of eternity).  So these people are trapped, trapped do you hear me, with (for the sake of the film's logic), no way of getting out.  The whole idea of doing ""Deliverance"" only with zombies instead of red necks was good enough, but they decided this film needed an evil corporate entity.The part where this film started to really lose me is our dwindling group of survivors finds some other survivors taking a different approach to the situation.  It was sort of like jumping from ""Night of the Living Dead"" to ""Day of the Dead"" all of the sudden.  It is a bit too jarring, as is the idea that a woman can go from being worried about being raped (not to mention being turned into a zombie) to deciding to have sex (I know it is supposed to symbolize the resilience of the human spirit and such, but it always strikes me as being somewhere between gratuitous and ludicrous).  But I am still inclined to round up on this movie because some of the scenes in the woods look pretty good, especially at the end when it starts raining.  Yes, the names of most of the characters have already escaped me, but they were all playing standard roles so names hardly matter.  Besides, you know somebody has to do something stupid so you can hardly fault somebody for doing something so monumentally stupid at the climax of this 2005 film.  At least they deserved their fate, which you cannot really say for most of these walking unhappy meals.For the most part the zombies move slow, but they do get into feeding frenzy moods once they have somebody to sink their teeth into, which happens early and often.  Yes, I know that they still should not be able to surprise people over and over again any more than everybody should suddenly have an inability to take two steps without falling down, but it is not like you are supposed to take this sort of thrill ride all that seriously in the first place.  Only ""Severed"" comes up for the title on this film, but the ""Forest of the Dead"" part could help people who are trying to find the zombie movie set in a forest.  I just watched ""Dog Soldiers"" last month, which was a werewolf movie set in a forest, so clearly horror movies set in forests can work.  Of course, in the beginning that was where horror stories took place as Little Red Riding Hood, Hansel and Gretel and all those other fairy tale surrogates went off into the woods and encountered all sort of dangers, with their attendant Freudian implications.",4,This time it is zombies in the forest going after tree cutters and tree huggers alike,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,5314,"['Severed',

994231,ASHBFCUZAYCS4,B000FQISUS,"Lord Schitsdain ""The sage of rage""","[0, 0]","This movie tries a new cause/affect, and location for the zombie genre as we are taken deep into the forest to escape from humans turned into zombies by tree sap from genetically modified trees. While it tries a new approach, it still includes most of the typical elements (cliche's) of the zombie genre. These north woods zombies are the slow, lumbering variety. You see, they are lumbering because it's a logging camp and lumber mill and, oh never mind. The action is filmed in the shaky, brittle 45 degree shutter look of ""28 Days Later"". It also includes the obligatory social/political messages; environmentalism, corporate greed, playing god, sadism, betrayal, love and redemption...too much for a zombie movie like this. The shaky cam quick edits were very distracting and could cause an epileptic seizure. The isolation and scenery are nice, but that is really all that this film adds to the genre, as we are still stuck with irrational, stupid behavior and plot holes. In a logging camp full of axes and 4 ft. chainsaws, these slow moving zombies should end up painting the forest red in short order, but nobody chooses to arm themselves and get aggressive.

994237,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000FQISUS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Severed: Forest of the Dead (Carl Bessai, 2005)Severed had the potential to be one of the great new-guard zombie flicks; it's got everything a truly great zombie film needs. And yes, for some reason, it just didn't take. I'm still trying to figure out just what went wrong.The story: a big foresting company is having problems with protesters. Meanwhile, their pet scientist Carter (JR Bourne of The Exorcism of Emily Rose) is working on a growth serum that will help the trees grow faster (thus both helping the industry and placating the environmentalists). Problem is, the serum's not quite ready for prime time yet, and when one of the workers gets some of it in his bloodstream after trying to cut down a spiked tree, the shortcomings are obvious: it turns people into zombies. So by the time the boss' son (Battlestar Galactica's Paul Campbell) shows up to find out why production's stopped, the woods are full of flesh-eaters, while only a small band of humans remain, headed up by Carter, camp foreman Mac (Julian Christoper, who also worked on ...Emily Rose), and Rita (The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford's Sarah Lind, the head of the protester group. Despite tensions within the survivors' group, all goes well until they find another batch of survivors, led by insane survivalist Anderson (Night at the Museum's Patrick Gallagher)...The main thing Severed does right is focus not so much on the zombies as on the survivors and the ways in which their reactions change as the crisis continues (both in its storyline and in its characters it puts me in mind of Robert Kirkman's excellent comic The Walking Dead). The script is top-notch, given that this is a bargain-basement Z-grade monster movie, and the acting talent is right in line, but bad acting isn't what drags this movie down, I don't think; some of the actors even come off quite well, considering (Gallagher, especially, is wonderful in this role). The direction is competent, the cinematography well-suited to the claustrophobia of the deep woods, the obligatory ecohorror environmental message worked into the mix far better than in most movies of this stripe.So I'm back to the question of why it doesn't quite work. The devil is in the details, I guess; I'm perfectly willing to put up with a predictable storyline if it kicks off some of the genre's cliches, or at least does something new with them. Severed fails to deliver on both counts, unfortunately. How far do you have to reach to keep this cast of characters in the woods? (Pretty far.) How stupid do the characters have to be to not find weapons in the middle of a logging camp? And how is it that zombification is (as usual) transferred by bite, and yet none of the survivors who's gotten blood in his or her mouth gets infected? You know, all the little questions that make you wonder if the writers of the movie have ever watched any zombie movies before (or know anything about bodily fluids-- one would think that the more zombie movies a person watches, the less they know about bodily fluids, but maybe that's just me).In any case, Severed never quite lived up to its promise, and that's a shame. I hope someone reworks the script a bit and remakes this one; I do think it could be great in the right hands. ***",3,"So close, and yet so far.",1203292800,"02 18, 2008",2008,3279,"['Severed', 'Forest', 'Dead', 'Carl', 'Bessai', '2005', 'Severed', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'one', 'great', 'new-guard', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'got', 'everything', 'truly', 'great', 'zombie', 'film', 'needs', 'yes', 'reason', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'went', 'wrong.The', 'story', 'big', 'foresting', 'company', 'having', 'problems', 'protesters', 'Meanwhile', 'pet', 'scientist', 'Carter', 'JR', 'Bourne', 'Exorcism', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'working', 'growth', 'serum', 'will', 'help', 'trees', 'grow', 'faster', 'thus', 'helping', 'industry', 'placating', 'environmentalists', 'Problem', 'serum', 'not', 'quite', 'ready', 'prime', 'time', 'yet', 'when', 'one', 'workers', 'bloodstream', 'trying', 'cut', 'down', 'spiked', 'tree', 'shortcomings', 'are', 'obvious', 'people', 'zombies', 'So', 'time', 'boss', 'son', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Paul', 'Campbell', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'production', 'stopped', 'woods', 'are', 'full', 'flesh-eaters', 'only', 'small', 'band', 'humans', 'remain', 'headed', 'up', 'Carter', 'camp', 'foreman', 'Mac', 'Julian', 'Christoper', 'who', 'also', 'worked', 'Emily', 'Rose', 'Rita', 'Assassination', 'Jesse', 'James', 'Coward', 'Robert', 'Ford', 'Sarah', 'Lind', 'head', 'protester', 'group', 'tensions', 'survivors', 'group', 'well', 'find', 'batch', 'survivors', 'led', 'insane', 'survivalist', 'Anderson', 'Night', 'Museum', 'Patrick', 'Gallagher', 'main', 'thing', 'Severed', 'right', 'focus', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'zombies', 'survivors', 'ways', 'reactions', 'change', 'crisis', 'storyline', 'characters', 'mind', 'Robert', 'Kirkman', 'excellent', 'Walking', 'Dead', 'script', 'top-notch', 'given', 'bargain-basement', 'Z-grade', 'monster', 'movie', 'acting', 'talent', 'right', 'line', 'bad', 'acting', ""n't"", 'what', 'drags', 'movie', 'down', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'actors', 'even', 'come', 'off', 'quite', 'well', 'considering', 'Gallagher', 'especially', 'wonderful', 'role', 'direction', 'competent', 'cinematography', 'well-suited', 'claustrophobia', 'deep', 'woods', 'obligatory', 'ecohorror', 'environmental', 'message', 'worked', 'mix', 'far', 'better', 'most', 'movies', 'stripe.So', ""'m"", 'back', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'devil', 'details', 'guess', ""'m"", 'perfectly', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'predictable', 'storyline', 'genre', 'cliches', 'least', 'something', 'new', 'Severed', 'fails', 'deliver', 'counts', 'unfortunately', 'How', 'far', 'do', 'have', 'reach', 'keep', 'cast', 'characters', 'woods', 'Pretty', 'far', 'How', 'stupid', 'do', 'characters', 'have', 'be', 'not', 'find', 'weapons', 'middle', 'logging', 'camp', 'how', 'zombification', 'usual', 'transferred', 'bite', 'yet', 'none', 'survivors', 'who', 'gotten', 'blood', 'mouth', 'infected', 'know', 'little', 'questions', 'make', 'wonder', 'writers', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'watched', 'zombie', 'movies', 'know', 'anything', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'more', 'zombie', 'movies', 'person', 'watches', 'less', 'know', 'bodily', 'fluids', 'maybe', 'just', 'case', 'Severed', 'never', 'quite', 'lived', 'up', 'promise', 'shame', 'hope', 'someone', 'script', 'bit', 'remakes', 'one', 'do', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'great', 'right', 'hands', '***']",Severed: Forest of the Dead

The movie starts out on an island where there is a battle between loggers and environmentalists. One of the loggers hits a spike while cutting down a tree. The recoil from the chainsaw cuts his shoulder. Some of the sap from the experimental tree gets in the wound and BINGO! You suddenly have a flesh eating zombie.The scene quickly moves to a board of director scene who haven't heard from the logging camp. There is a long dialogue scene between the owner of the company and his son while they are playing snooker. It is badly written, badly acted, and badly directed, pretty much like the rest of the movie. The owner wants his son to learn the business so he goes out to the camp, which he finds deserted and he is chased by zombies, who at times can run fast, and other times move like they have a broken leg.Meanwhile back in the lab a clumsy bio-chemist cuts himself and gets some of the evil sap in his blood. He goes on to bite the neck out of his partner. Then we have the lab covered in plastic. A man in protective gear is taking pictures of the scene at the same time two guys in suits are standing there. Dad decides his son is in danger and the decision is made to lock down the logging camp, even though no one really knows what is going on.Junior tells his fellow humans alive in a lean-to he has ""a truck."" They all decide to pile into the truck to escape. (None of the heavy equipment located by the truck was acceptable for some reason.)

994246,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,B000FQISUS,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[3, 5]","I had very high hopes for this movie, since I am a huge zombie/undead fan.  Consequently this movie was rather humdrum and a bit of a let down.  The only thing the movie really had going for it was the scenery, which looks like Alaska.  The scenery did create a rather ominous mood, but somehow the end result was flat.  The make-up for the zombies/undead was done well.  Yet the cinematography was hideous, whenever there was any action or fighting the camera work was so shaky that you really couldn't see anything, this film technique only made me sick and dizzy.  Image the Blair Witch Project and a very, very, very tall Captain Morgan.Another thing that kind of annoyed me was when there was an action sequence the camera seemed to cut away quickly before any real gore or carnage transpired.  Come on, this is a zombie/undead movie don't ease up on the blood and guts.  Save the suspense and ""leave it to the imagination"" to film noirs and thrillers, not ZOMBIE/UNDEAD MOVIES!!!  Then with about twenty-five minutes left in the movie, an entire group of new characters are introduced for no motive whatsoever.  As for the lead characters, they are kind of weak and insipid.  Then for some silly purpose to plot (?) there is a no reason romance.  Now the rationale for the zombies/undead breakout is explained and does meet horror movie requirements.  Nonetheless, there is a scene that could have really produced some havoc outside the main storyline and it never went anywhere.  As for the ending, well that was very disappointing too.If you really want to watch an undead/zombie movie and can't find anything better, give Severed: Forest of the Undead a watch.

Environmentalists battling to save trees from a logging company, spike some of the trees with some kind of genetically modified substance that winds up infecting a logger when he is accidentally cut.  The disease quickly spreads, and the tree huggers and the loggers put aside some of their differences in order to survive and escape the growing horde of the undead.Tyler (Paul Campbell) the son of one of the logging company execs is sent to a remote logging camp that the company has lost touch with.  There he discovers that the infected are loose and is forced to take refuge with a group of survivors that includes company foreman Mac (Julian Christopher), logger Luke (Michael Teigen), field man Carter (J.R. Bourne), and conservationist Rita Hoffman (Sarah Lind).  After finding the road blocked, the group returns to the logging camp, where they fail to contact anyone on the radio.  Apparently no one has a cell phone.The film features a number of clich&eacute;s which kind of get annoying, one is that although the forest is vast, at times the area seems to be practically overrun with the zombies.  The shaky camera shots and choppy editing, during the fights with the zombies, gets real tired after a while.  The road to safety is mysteriously blocked twice, and the survivors manage to crash a perfectly good truck, so they twice wind up on foot.  Carter is a gutless wonder, who lets others die.  And finally, too many blood spattered faces, that become a continuity nightmare.The story takes a detour, when the group is abducted by another band of survivors led by a guy named Anderson (Patrick Gallagher).  There is some hope that something better might develop at the end, but it really doesn't happen, introducing a silly romantic element as the movie fizzles out, unable go anywhere particularly special.

One of the most glaring is when the zombies grab the guy (forgot his name) who was ""like a son"" to the leader of the survivors. instead of feasting on his entrails, they decide to carry him off as if to pack him away for the winter. This let me know that the guy was going to somehoe get away from 2 zombies, and come back later and force the leader guy to make the hard choice of having to kill a kid that was like a son to him. My eyes rolled out of my head at that point. There wasn't a lot of gore, but there was some suspense, but the movie never held up, and i know we are a orrible species and all, but does everyone who falls into a zombie holocaust have to make a fighting arena where you have to fight zombies? Do we ALWAYS have to prey on each other, and instead of showing compassion in the face of overwhelming odds, do we have to try to subjugate everyone around us? I'm sick of zombie movies where the humans are worse than the undead. I tend to let little annoyances drop when there's a souless monter trying to eat my flesh. Instead, we get what we always get: a megolomaniac who thinks he's a king and rules basically a cabin while zombies amass outside his yard.
