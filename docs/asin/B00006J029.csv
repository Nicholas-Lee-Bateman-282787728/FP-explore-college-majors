717424,A374OO1EAUZASC,B00006J029,2201,"[36, 38]","The Dancing Outlaw is a great video documentary which goes through the quotidian routine of a very abnormal man--Jesco White.  He has coined himself the ""last mountain dancer"" and does a form of tap dancing set to old-timey country music (mainly, The Wildwood Flower.)  Where the video is so interesting is in its portrayal of his obvious mental illness(es) including his split personality syndrome (Jesco/Jesse/Elvis,) his dysfunctional and somewhat abusive relationship with his wife Norma, and his brain damage from huffing too much lighter fluid in his troubled youth.  You'll see what he does for fun (mud bogging, etc) and basically explore all the areas of this man's life.  Even with the obvious humor, it is presented in a very artistic fashion, leaving an intelligent viewer to question how someone from dirt poor roots with this level of mental illness could still exist in this day and age. Yet even more puzzling is that he seems very happy with what most people would consider a pathetic life.However, most people with whom I've seen the documentary totally miss the social commentary and treat it as a comedy.  ""Ha ha look at those dumb hillbillies"" and ""wow West Virginia must be a really weird place"" kinds of reactions.  If that's all you take from the documentary, you're the unsophisticated one.  Do not make broad generalizations about the people of Appalachia or of working-class and rural populations based on the film.",5,Great kitsch video,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",2004,1442,"['Dancing', 'Outlaw', 'great', 'video', 'documentary', 'quotidian', 'routine', 'very', 'abnormal', 'man', 'Jesco', 'White', 'coined', 'last', 'mountain', 'dancer', 'form', 'tap', 'dancing', 'set', 'old-timey', 'country', 'music', 'mainly', 'Wildwood', 'Flower', 'Where', 'video', 'so', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'obvious', 'mental', 'illness', 'es', 'including', 'split', 'personality', 'syndrome', 'Jesco/Jesse/Elvis', 'dysfunctional', 'somewhat', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'wife', 'Norma', 'brain', 'damage', 'huffing', 'too', 'much', 'lighter', 'fluid', 'troubled', 'youth', ""'ll"", 'see', 'what', 'fun', 'mud', 'bogging', 'etc', 'basically', 'explore', 'areas', 'man', 'life', 'Even', 'obvious', 'humor', 'presented', 'very', 'artistic', 'fashion', 'leaving', 'intelligent', 'viewer', 'question', 'how', 'someone', 'dirt', 'poor', 'roots', 'level', 'mental', 'illness', 'could', 'still', 'exist', 'day', 'age', 'even', 'more', 'puzzling', 'very', 'happy', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'pathetic', 'life.However', 'most', 'people', 'whom', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'documentary', 'totally', 'miss', 'social', 'commentary', 'treat', 'comedy', 'Ha', 'ha', 'look', 'dumb', 'hillbillies', 'wow', 'West', 'Virginia', 'must', 'be', 'really', 'weird', 'place', 'kinds', 'reactions', 'take', 'documentary', ""'re"", 'unsophisticated', 'one', 'not', 'make', 'broad', 'generalizations', 'people', 'Appalachia', 'working-class', 'rural', 'populations', 'based', 'film']",Dancing Outlaw VHS

Hundreds showed up - and for good reason. It is the best selling film ever made inside West Virginia - about a West Virginian. It is also the best short documentary about an unusual man and his life ever made, making my Top Ten list of all times - in Facets Multimedia. The director, Jacob Young, watched films by Les Blank and Errol Morris, and using some of their style and his own, created a masterpiece. At one time the state library of West Virginia had at least 8 copies of this film, loaning all of them out for a decade or more. It is hilarious, sad, tragic, insightful - and about everything else one can show in a film.

It's &quot;Dancing Outlaw&quot; and it may very well be the scariest film ever made.Dancing Outlaw&quot; is the true story of Jesco (Jescoe, Jessco?) White, the most ignorant, backward, and flat out insane hillbilly to ever cut a rug on top of a doghouse.  Remember all of those jokes about West Virginians?  Well, those people exist and Jesco is one of them.  Jesco and wife make the average Jerry Springer guest look like Ward Cleaver.Besides dancing, Jesco likes to pretend he is Elvis, huff paint, drink, and terrorize his pathetic wife (...So I held the butcher knife up to her neck, right?  And I said, &quot;Woman!  What did I tell you about cooking them sloppy slimey eggs!?&quot;)  Jesco is obviously mentally disturbed and that will make you feel even worse about laughing at him.  Some might find this documentary to be a bit too cruel.  However, I got the feeling that the filmakers actually kind of liked Jesco.  It is true, though, that a pretty dark view of humanity is presented here.  This is very black comedy and the fact that it is real actually just gives it all a tragic significance.  There are a lot of Jescos out there.  I have never been so horrified and so amused at the same time.This tape is expensive; too expensive for me.  If you have the money, grab it.
