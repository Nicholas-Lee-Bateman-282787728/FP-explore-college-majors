It's a road movie but there is so much more. I love the characters. The actors playing them are all fantastic. I know this is an awful review but if you have ever just wanted to relax, past midnight, to watch a cool movie that will make you laugh but not to where your ribs hurt (the older we get, the harder it is to watch really, really funny movies, isn't it?) then this is your film.",5,THE BEST!,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,501,"['love', 'movie', 'wall-to-wall', 'entertainment', 'rather', 'tire-to-tire', 'Not', 'one', 'minute', 'bored', 'road', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'love', 'characters', 'actors', 'playing', 'are', 'fantastic', 'know', 'awful', 'review', 'have', 'ever', 'just', 'wanted', 'relax', 'past', 'midnight', 'watch', 'cool', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'not', 'where', 'ribs', 'hurt', 'older', 'get', 'harder', 'watch', 'really', 'really', 'funny', 'movies', ""n't"", 'then', 'film']",Honky Tonk Freeway

Just check out the list of actors in this film, not to mention the characters, and situations the portray, all of them on their way to Florida for one reason or the other, all connecting in the town of Ticlaw. They could have made a sitcom of this movie and I'm  sure it would have been on the tube for years. I first watched this on HBO in the 80s, taped it, and have enjoyed it ever since.

Having probably the worst, most ill-conceived title possible and no real star power, it was easy to overlook.  The fact is, it's a funny movie. This isn't ""art"" and it doesn't pretent to be.
