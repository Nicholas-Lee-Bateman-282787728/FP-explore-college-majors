1111412,A1I1GC24YNZJO2,B000WR4L5Q,A. Ryan,"[55, 58]","This is another very moving film in the growing group of inspiring, well made feature films on lives of saints produced in Italy, and released in the USA by Ignatius Press. Young Italian actress Martina Pinto gives a luminous performance as St. Maria Goretti, the daughter of outstanding parents who struggle heroically to raise their children amidst the poverty and malaria infested swamps in Italy. She epitomizes that purity and goodness that have been strongly associated with this martyr and patroness of modern youth. Popular actor Flavio Insinna (St. John Bosco) stars as the brave parish priest standing up against the injustices to the poor who takes the Goretti family under his wing. Well-known glamorous Italian actress Claudia Koll, who has had a major spiritual conversion in her own personal life, starts as the Countess Mazzoleni.The powerful movie is beautifully filmed on location with outstanding cinematography. A real bonus in this film is the gorgeous music score by legendary Oscar winning film composer Ennio Morricone. Plus the DVD includes a very informative 16 page collector's booklet about Maria Goretti and the film, replete with numerous photos from the film.

I'm about to depart.Looking back at my past, I can see that in my early youth, I chose a bad path which led me to ruin myself.My behavior was influenced by print, mass-media and bad examples which are followed by the majority of young people without even thinking. And I did the same. I was not worried.There were a lot of generous and devoted people who surrounded me, but I paid no attention to them because a violent force blinded me and pushed me toward a wrong way of life.When I was 20 years-old, I committed a crime of passion. Now, that memory represents something horrible for me. Maria Goretti, now a Saint, was my good Angel, sent to me through Providence to guide and save me.I still have impressed upon my heart her words of rebuke and of pardon. She prayed for me, she interceded for her murderer. Thirty years of prison followed.If I had been of age, I would have spent all my life in prison. I accepted to be condemned because it was my own fault.Little Maria was really my light, my protectress; with her help, I behaved well during the 27 years of prison and tried to live honestly when I was again accepted among the members of society.The Brothers of St. Francis, Capuchins from Marche, welcomed me with angelic charity into their monastery as a brother, not as a servant. I've been living with their community for 24 years, and now I am serenely waiting to witness the vision of God, to hug my loved ones again, and to be next to my Guardian Angel and her dear mother, Assunta.I hope this letter that I wrote can teach others the happy lesson of avoiding evil and of always following the right path, like little children.I feel that religion with its precepts is not something we can live without, but rather it is the real comfort, the real strength in life and the only safe way in every circumstance, even the most painful ones of life.""Signature, Alessandro Serenelli",5,Addicting,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,2369,"['am', 'addicted', 'movie', 'remember', 'seeing', 'movie', 'Maria', 'Goretti', 'Catholic', 'grade', 'school', 'only', 'once', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'see', 'teachers', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'students', 'discuss', 'over', 'music', 'scenery', 'wretchedness', 'times', 'are', 'overwhelming', 'have', 'tried', 'find', 'more', 'information', 'actors', 'little.Please', 'read', 'Allessandro', 'Serenellis', 'final', 'letter', 'did', 'found', ""'m"", 'nearly', '80', 'years', 'old', ""'m"", 'depart.Looking', 'back', 'past', 'can', 'see', 'early', 'youth', 'chose', 'bad', 'path', 'led', 'ruin', 'myself.My', 'behavior', 'was', 'influenced', 'print', 'mass-media', 'bad', 'examples', 'are', 'followed', 'majority', 'young', 'people', 'even', 'thinking', 'did', 'same', 'was', 'not', 'worried.There', 'were', 'lot', 'generous', 'devoted', 'people', 'who', 'surrounded', 'paid', 'attention', 'violent', 'force', 'blinded', 'pushed', 'wrong', 'way', 'life.When', 'was', '20', 'years-old', 'committed', 'crime', 'passion', 'Now', 'memory', 'something', 'horrible', 'Maria', 'Goretti', 'now', 'Saint', 'was', 'good', 'Angel', 'sent', 'Providence', 'guide', 'save', 'me.I', 'still', 'have', 'impressed', 'heart', 'words', 'rebuke', 'pardon', 'prayed', 'interceded', 'murderer', 'Thirty', 'years', 'prison', 'followed.If', 'had', 'been', 'age', 'would', 'have', 'spent', 'life', 'prison', 'accepted', 'be', 'condemned', 'was', 'own', 'fault.Little', 'Maria', 'was', 'really', 'light', 'protectress', 'help', 'behaved', 'well', '27', 'years', 'prison', 'tried', 'live', 'honestly', 'when', 'was', 'again', 'accepted', 'members', 'society.The', 'Brothers', 'St.', 'Francis', 'Capuchins', 'Marche', 'welcomed', 'angelic', 'charity', 'monastery', 'brother', 'not', 'servant', ""'ve"", 'been', 'living', 'community', '24', 'years', 'now', 'am', 'serenely', 'waiting', 'witness', 'vision', 'God', 'hug', 'loved', 'ones', 'again', 'be', 'next', 'Guardian', 'Angel', 'dear', 'mother', 'Assunta.I', 'hope', 'letter', 'wrote', 'can', 'teach', 'others', 'happy', 'lesson', 'avoiding', 'evil', 'always', 'following', 'right', 'path', 'little', 'children.I', 'feel', 'religion', 'precepts', 'not', 'something', 'can', 'live', 'rather', 'real', 'comfort', 'real', 'strength', 'life', 'only', 'safe', 'way', 'circumstance', 'even', 'most', 'painful', 'ones', 'life', 'Signature', 'Alessandro', 'Serenelli']",Maria Goretti

1111426,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,B000WR4L5Q,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[1, 1]","This 2003 film, only 105 minutes long, tells the real life story of St. Maria Goretti, a 12-year old Catholic girl who was killed in 1902 by a 19-year old neighbor boy named Alessandro who stabbed her 14 times after she resisted his rape attempts. The Catholic Church subsequently declared her a saint for one thing only: She forgave her would-be rapist and murderer on her deathbed, leading to his own conversion back to God. Maria's mother and murderer (who ultimately died in 1970 as a brother in a religious order) attended her canonization in 1950, when Pope Pius XII also declared Maria the patron saint of modern youth. Among all of the Italian saint movies released to the US market by Ignatius Press, this film is one of the best, and is full of beautiful music (by Andrea and Ennio Morricone) as well as scenery. The young Italian actress who plays Maria is surprisingly charismatic. To appreciate her performance, I strongly recommend viewing the film in its original Italian with English subtitles, rather than exercising the option of a poorly done English dubbed track on the DVD.A Passionist priest who was Maria Goretti's pastor figures heavily into the plot, which movingly portrays the social and political winds that produced widespread poverty on the Italian farmlands, particularly the malaria outbreak that killed Maria's own dad when she was nine. The priest, Father Basilio, has some sharp exchanges with the local landowner, an Italian count who refused to pay for quinine to cure his workers of the malaria. An early exchange where the count accuses Father Basilio of being a socialist and Father Basilio responds by citing Pope Leo XIII's &#34;Rerum Novarum&#34; encyclical is sharply observed, witnessing to the controversial birth of Catholic social thought. The film spends a lot of time introducing us to the workers and their plight, while depicting the count as confident they will not rebel because both sides depend on the success of the land, owner and serfs alike. If all of this sounds episodic, it's actually quite relevant to Maria's story, as it sets out for us the desperate social setting that led her desperate neighbor to assault her. It's ultimately a sad movie about one girl's efforts to hold onto the ideals of her faith despite the crushing reality of poverty that puts her in greater danger than she knows.As with most Ignatius Press films, there is a booklet of background information included with the disc, wherein the film is presented in widescreen without any special features on the disc other than language options. Despite the highly emotional subject matter of a 12-year old martyr who died resisting rape, melodramatic flourishes are kept to a (relative) minimum, and there's nothing cheesy in any of the plot points as one finds in many other films of this genre. If there's any downside to the film, it's the relentless sadness of the whole affair, which fails to be alleviated by the curt words of forgiveness and pealing bells that accompany Maria's saintly death. The movie's dominant mood is one of sadness, poverty, and despair. Stopping short of being truly inspirational or uplifting, &#34;Maria Goretti&#34; gives us the facts of an essentially sad story in an even sadder cultural context.
