Brace yourself for more of the same tired cliches in the new zombie survival film DEAD SEASON, Adam Deyoe's fifth feature film following other such classics as PSYCHO SLEEPOVER and YETI: A LOVE STORY. The bore-o-meter is reading surprisingly high in Florida during this year's DEAD SEASON, with the only thing duller than the characters being the dreadful dialog that accompanies them. Cinematography Jeffrey Peters seems unusually obsessed with keeping everything tight in frame, filming nearly every shot in an unnecessary close-up. Credit is due to the film's make-up team for sticking strictly to practical effects, but the zombie action is infrequent at best, and hardly worth the wait.

Not the ""tremendous"" movie you read other ""reviewers"" writing about.

Do they get these lines out of a ""how to pretend to be someone else praising your own movie"" book?

I watch just about every zombie movie that comes out from the big budget ones down to things made for a hundred bucks. What i can tell you is that along THAT continuum, this is by far above average. But does that mean its GOOD? I'm not sure - but its not BAD. As far as the technical aspects go, this film is lovely. The cinematography is excellent (i'm going to assume it was filmed on DSLR - looks like a 5D or 7D?) and everything is wonderfully framed. The acting is above par for a film of this budget. The ""bad"" guy is the strongest performance, with maybe the most unsteady of all coming from the male ""lead"" - though not to a degree that takes away from anything. I use quotation marks because there isn't really a lead or a villain, just people that NEARLY take that role. Now, i don't have a problem with not filling standard archetypes of film - its just that these characters could have been so much deeper. The pacing of this film was so fast that you didn't really get a chance to feel story. It could have been about half an hour longer, really. But the pacing was so quick that some of the scenes didn't work - such as an emotionally intense execution of an infected party member when, in fact, you've only had 5 minutes of screen time to get to know the character. It just feels a little bit rushed, which upsets you because it didn't need to be rushed.The zombie make up was alright. Not amazing but not cheap. The sets work really well and you believe pretty much everything you see. There is even a few doses of nudity that, well, aren't half bad.Overall, I would recommend this movie and really would have liked to have seen a longer, more ""fleshed out"" version.",3,Not Bad - Would have appreciated a slower pace and more innuendo,1343433600,"07 28, 2012",2012,1719,"['was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'one', 'watch', 'just', 'about', 'zombie', 'movie', 'out', 'big', 'budget', 'ones', 'down', 'things', 'made', 'hundred', 'bucks', 'What', 'i', 'can', 'tell', 'continuum', 'far', 'above', 'average', 'mean', 'GOOD', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'not', 'BAD', 'As', 'far', 'technical', 'aspects', 'go', 'film', 'lovely', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'assume', 'was', 'filmed', 'DSLR', '5D', '7D', 'everything', 'wonderfully', 'framed', 'acting', 'par', 'film', 'budget', 'bad', 'guy', 'strongest', 'performance', 'maybe', 'most', 'unsteady', 'coming', 'male', 'lead', 'not', 'degree', 'away', 'anything', 'use', 'quotation', 'marks', ""n't"", 'really', 'lead', 'villain', 'just', 'people', 'NEARLY', 'take', 'role', 'Now', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problem', 'not', 'filling', 'standard', 'archetypes', 'film', 'just', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'deeper', 'pacing', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'fast', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'chance', 'feel', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'hour', 'longer', 'really', 'pacing', 'was', 'so', 'quick', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'such', 'emotionally', 'intense', 'execution', 'infected', 'party', 'member', 'when', 'fact', ""'ve"", 'only', 'had', '5', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'get', 'know', 'character', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'rushed', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'be', 'rushed.The', 'zombie', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'alright', 'Not', 'amazing', 'not', 'cheap', 'sets', 'work', 'really', 'well', 'believe', 'pretty', 'much', 'everything', 'see', 'even', 'few', 'doses', 'nudity', 'well', 'are', ""n't"", 'half', 'bad.Overall', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'longer', 'more', 'fleshed', 'out', 'version']",Dead Season

I never judge a zombie movie by theDVD jacket art.  This movie had a good story line that was somewhatpredictable.  Right off of the bat, we knew our survivers were toughenough to take on a challenge.  Same goal as many survivors have, ""Letsgo to an island, where it is safe!""  The boat dealer was silly.  Whenthe boat left the marina, those background lights demonstrated that ourmovie producer couldn't get the natives to turn off their lights for azombie apocalypse!  Something could have been improvised, but wasn't.The zombie make-up was acceptable, better than most low budget ones.Character development was disappointing. The military commander wasstereotypical. There wasn't time to think that the island was a idealicretreat, safe from zombie hoards(and worth fighting to protect), beforeour characters are looking hard for a boat to escape in.The movie has a few surprises that are origional.If you are bored and like zombie movies, this one merits watching.During the slower parts of the movie, I found myself looking for mistakesthat made it past the editor.

With that out of the way let me say that I enjoyed and found this to be a pretty good movie about what survivors would do to survive and take care of the ones they love during a zombie outbreak! This movie is not a mindless ""shoot-um-up"", blood and gore action zombie movie!No, Dead Season isn't perfect, it has a few minor flaws ... there were several continuity problems, (Tweeter & Elvis go to pick up their boat and somehow her clean white tank top gets blood all across it... and after Elvis & Tweeter get garden hose bathed and are all clean, a bruise seems to appear on Elvis' face right after he and Tweeter are separated and Conrad comes to ask a few simple questions).  And there were several scenes that I feel could have been fleshed out or just completely dropped entirely, mainly Tweeter's watching the tape of the birthday party... yes, Conrad cuts the cake while Elvis cuts up dinner, but I really didn't think it informed me on what kind of person Conrad was before the zombie apocalypse and why he would change his ""diet"" after the z.a.!There are a few problems with the pacing of the movie. Some scenes zoom by while others just drag along. I'm sure budget and time constraints are the major reason for this. I only wish the movie had run a little longer, but with that said, after watching the deleted scenes... thank goodness they were taken out!Plot holes, pacing and inconsistencies aside, on the positive side, I found the story interesting (no, it is nothing really new to the zombie genre, this is a zombie movie not some major Hollywood remake, and it didn't tell how or why folks were becoming zombies but this movie is about folks trying to survive, not pontificate and then search for a cure!). Most importantly, time and thought was taken when the story and script were written. Guess what, characters are not standing around arguing and yelling at each other throughout the entire movie! Yea for the script writers for taking the time to write believable character dialogue!  As for the actors and their acting ability, I thought the actors did a fine acting job. Sure, some were better than others, but I though all the actors did their job well enough for me to suspend disbelief and enjoy some zombie fighting action!  As for zombie make-up and special effects, I thought both were just fine!

In fact I jumped at one scene in this one. But I must say it is sorta clunky. And non zombie fans may not be happy with this one. As it's got the lowest of budgets. The zombies look like it was part of 'zombie lake' which is from 1980 and alot cheesier than this. This is NOT cheesy, it's just that they have people get through mobs of 40 zombies just by walking through them. in some scenes and then others similiar scenes the mob gets the cast member. That was clunky to be sure. The filmmaking at least used film and doesn't jerk around or use a hand camera. The lead actress is the best one in this flick , she does a good job, the male lead is decent too. These people at least seem to have had some experience before. maybe not though. Still their is a big problem of living on a radioactive island that is not in the pacific.  Because that's where all the nuke tests were done. And who would pick such a island to go to? even in a zombie apocalypse? Anyways if  you don't like very low budget movies made by non studios then skip this as it's got limited money to spend on anything. But if  you are fan of very low budget horror films which are mostly bad films with some interest, then you will probably find this worth a watch.

1536194,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B007R5A1FA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","Dead Season (Adam Deyoe, 2012)Below average, but not entirely unwatchable, zombie thriller that at least attempts to do what every good zombie movie should: focus more on the survivors than the zombies. (Have you noticed how few recent zombie movies actually do that?) It's an amateur production made mostly by folks who generally do other things in the world (director Adam Deyoe, for example, usually works in the art department; his most recent job as I write this was as the art swing on Fading of the Cries. No wonder he wants to direct. But he also worked as the set dresser on the highly underrated 2006 shlockfest Candy Stripers, so it hasn't all been downhill), and from that angle, I have to give everyone involved points for enthusiasm, at least.Plot: Elvis (Transformers' Scott Peat) and Tweeter (The Symphony's Marissa Merrill) are two of the final survivors of the zombie apocalypse still alive in mainland America. They've made it to Miami, where they're hoping to get out to the islands, where they figure they will have a better chance of survival. They procure a boat and head south, finding what they're looking for--but it turns out to be a little less idyllic than they were hoping.The movie's strongest point is that it's got some really interesting ideas--not only about how people will survive after everything goes to hell (think of this as a different twist on the ""we promised them women"" scene from 28 Days Later...), but about how the pragmatism enforced upon survivors in the face of an apocalypse can bring about shifting allegiances and force people to make decisions that they would otherwise not even think about. Unfortunately, Deyoe's screenplay, so-written with Joshua Klausner and Loren Semmens (both producers trying their first hand at writing), doesn't spend nearly enough time exploring these aspects of the world they've built; they're too busy adding in the odd action scene here and there to keep the gorehounds from getting too restless. Which I guess is a valid point when you're trying to make a genre horror film, but then when you start adding in all those interesting questions, one has to wonder: at which point have you stopped making a genre horror film and started aspiring to something greater? That question, alas, I do not think got asked; if it had, we might have a very different, and much better, movie on our hands. But for a no-budget genre zombie thriller, it's not bad. **",2,A Day No Pigs Would Die,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",2013,2437,"['Dead', 'Season', 'Adam', 'Deyoe', '2012', 'average', 'not', 'entirely', 'unwatchable', 'zombie', 'thriller', 'least', 'attempts', 'do', 'what', 'good', 'zombie', 'movie', 'should', 'focus', 'more', 'survivors', 'zombies', 'Have', 'noticed', 'how', 'few', 'recent', 'zombie', 'movies', 'actually', 'do', 'amateur', 'production', 'made', 'mostly', 'folks', 'who', 'generally', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'world', 'director', 'Adam', 'Deyoe', 'example', 'usually', 'art', 'department', 'most', 'recent', 'job', 'write', 'was', 'art', 'swing', 'Fading', 'Cries', 'wonder', 'direct', 'also', 'worked', 'set', 'dresser', 'highly', 'underrated', '2006', 'shlockfest', 'Candy', 'Stripers', ""n't"", 'been', 'downhill', 'angle', 'have', 'give', 'everyone', 'involved', 'points', 'enthusiasm', 'least.Plot', 'Elvis', 'Transformers', 'Scott', 'Peat', 'Tweeter', 'Symphony', 'Marissa', 'Merrill', 'are', 'two', 'final', 'survivors', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'still', 'alive', 'mainland', 'America', ""'ve"", 'made', 'Miami', 'where', ""'re"", 'hoping', 'get', 'out', 'islands', 'where', 'figure', 'will', 'have', 'better', 'chance', 'survival', 'procure', 'boat', 'head', 'south', 'finding', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking', 'out', 'be', 'little', 'less', 'idyllic', 'were', 'hoping.The', 'movie', 'strongest', 'point', 'got', 'really', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'not', 'only', 'how', 'people', 'will', 'survive', 'everything', 'hell', 'think', 'different', 'twist', 'promised', 'women', 'scene', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'how', 'pragmatism', 'enforced', 'survivors', 'face', 'apocalypse', 'can', 'bring', 'about', 'shifting', 'allegiances', 'force', 'people', 'make', 'decisions', 'would', 'otherwise', 'not', 'even', 'think', 'Unfortunately', 'Deyoe', 'screenplay', 'so-written', 'Joshua', 'Klausner', 'Loren', 'Semmens', 'producers', 'trying', 'first', 'hand', 'writing', ""n't"", 'spend', 'nearly', 'enough', 'time', 'exploring', 'aspects', 'world', ""'ve"", 'built', ""'re"", 'too', 'busy', 'adding', 'odd', 'action', 'scene', 'here', 'there', 'keep', 'gorehounds', 'getting', 'too', 'restless', 'Which', 'guess', 'valid', 'point', 'when', ""'re"", 'trying', 'make', 'genre', 'horror', 'film', 'then', 'when', 'start', 'adding', 'interesting', 'questions', 'one', 'wonder', 'point', 'have', 'stopped', 'making', 'genre', 'horror', 'film', 'started', 'aspiring', 'something', 'greater', 'question', 'alas', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'got', 'asked', 'had', 'might', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'hands', 'no-budget', 'genre', 'zombie', 'thriller', 'not', 'bad', '**']",Dead Season

They said that if you try amputation the person will still live, but will still become a zombie later on. Okay, what the heck was the point of that?

1536201,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B007R5A1FA,Tim Janson,"[4, 7]","In theory, it should not be that difficult to make a decent zombie film.  It's one sub-genre where fans don't mind you sticking to a tried and true formula...in fact most zombie film fans prefer that you do.  You can make a good zombie film on a very small budget and with actors who have little or no experience.  George Romero and many others have proven this over and over...But you know what you don't want in a zombie film?  You don't want an overly complex plot and unfortunately that's what you get with Dead Season.Dead Season begins by staying within the usual zombie formula...a zombie outbreak has hit the world as a handful of survivors struggle to carry on.  Elvis and Tweeter (and I swear that is their names in the film) are a pair of survivors who meet by chance.  They are able to procure a boat to take them to DeSoto island, off the coast of Florida, where there is a rumored safe harbor.  They arrive to find that a group has established a fort at a former naval gunnery range.  The fort is commanded by Kurt Conrad who runs things just like a military base.After the first half hour, Dead Season slows to a crawl, concentrating far too much on drama within the camp rather than surviving against the undead.  Kurt keeps his young daughter locked up in her room all day for her protection.  Elvis and Kurt battle over philosophical differences and then a silly twist that conjures up memories of the 1970s sci-fi film Soylent Green completely unhinges the film.  When a zombie film is good, you can easily overlook things like bad scripting and acting.  But when it's not good, those things stand out even more.  Dead Season is loaded with holes.  The make-up effects are average.  There's nothing much in the way of rotting zombies, just sort of standard pale makeup and blood effects.  Not bad but nothing stands out.  Moreover a morose piano soundtrack helps keep the tone slow and depressing.This is a film that started out on the right path but director Adam Deyoe simply tried to do too much and didn't concentrate on just making a zombie film.",2,dull zombie film,1343260800,"07 26, 2012",2012,2070,"['theory', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'difficult', 'make', 'decent', 'zombie', 'film', 'one', 'sub-genre', 'where', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'sticking', 'tried', 'true', 'formula', 'fact', 'most', 'zombie', 'film', 'fans', 'prefer', 'do', 'can', 'make', 'good', 'zombie', 'film', 'very', 'small', 'budget', 'actors', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'experience', 'George', 'Romero', 'many', 'others', 'have', 'proven', 'over', 'know', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'zombie', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'overly', 'complex', 'plot', 'unfortunately', 'what', 'get', 'Dead', 'Season.Dead', 'Season', 'staying', 'usual', 'zombie', 'formula', 'zombie', 'outbreak', 'hit', 'world', 'handful', 'survivors', 'struggle', 'carry', 'Elvis', 'Tweeter', 'swear', 'names', 'film', 'are', 'pair', 'survivors', 'who', 'meet', 'chance', 'are', 'able', 'procure', 'boat', 'take', 'DeSoto', 'island', 'coast', 'Florida', 'where', 'rumored', 'safe', 'harbor', 'arrive', 'find', 'group', 'established', 'fort', 'former', 'naval', 'gunnery', 'range', 'fort', 'commanded', 'Kurt', 'Conrad', 'who', 'things', 'just', 'military', 'base.After', 'first', 'half', 'hour', 'Dead', 'Season', 'crawl', 'concentrating', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'camp', 'rather', 'surviving', 'undead', 'Kurt', 'young', 'daughter', 'locked', 'up', 'room', 'day', 'protection', 'Elvis', 'Kurt', 'battle', 'philosophical', 'differences', 'then', 'silly', 'twist', 'up', 'memories', '1970s', 'sci-fi', 'film', 'Soylent', 'Green', 'completely', 'film', 'When', 'zombie', 'film', 'good', 'can', 'easily', 'overlook', 'things', 'bad', 'scripting', 'acting', 'when', 'not', 'good', 'things', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'Dead', 'Season', 'loaded', 'holes', 'make-up', 'effects', 'are', 'average', 'nothing', 'much', 'way', 'rotting', 'zombies', 'just', 'sort', 'standard', 'pale', 'makeup', 'blood', 'effects', 'Not', 'bad', 'nothing', 'out', 'Moreover', 'morose', 'piano', 'soundtrack', 'keep', 'tone', 'slow', 'depressing.This', 'film', 'started', 'out', 'right', 'path', 'director', 'Adam', 'Deyoe', 'simply', 'tried', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'concentrate', 'just', 'making', 'zombie', 'film']",Dead Season
1536202,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B007R5A1FA,"Tommy Dooley ""Tom""","[1, 1]","Yes this is another Zombie film it is also known as `The Running Dead'. The synopsis is that the outbreak of `the walkers' has been raging for a year and as usual society has collapsed and the few survivors face a daily battle to get the remaining food and just survive. Elvis (Scott Peat -`Transformers') makes contact with Tweeter (Marissa Merrill) and she has adopted a young boy called Toady, so all the names are original. They decide there is safety in numbers.Well Elvis has made a deal to get a boat and enough fuel to get to this island that is allegedly Zombie free. So they go for it. At this point in time the Zombies can only shuffle around in the normal way, but they are beginning to mutate and reports are coming through that they have managed to evolve to being much more athletic.Once on the island they discover that what they were told was not a clear representation of the facts and the daily struggle gets worse. There are loads of Zombie films that do a new take on the genre and this does try that, but for gore fans there may not be enough here to hold your full attention as much of the movie deals with the relationships of the non Zombies and how they are coping with the mental trauma. However the film actually works better for it as the Zombie menace is never very far away and is influencing everything else.This is a well acted and directed film but I really didn't think it was overly inventive which is actually fine for Zombie purists as we have seen some very un Zombie behaviour in a few of late like `Dead Heads' to name but one. Still if you like a good character study with Zombie `action' and half a market (yes they bought the gore in a market in Mexico) of gore, then you will probably enjoy this.",4,A Film where the Zombies can run - shocker!,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",2013,1741,"['Yes', 'Zombie', 'film', 'also', 'known', 'Running', 'Dead', 'synopsis', 'outbreak', 'walkers', 'been', 'raging', 'year', 'usual', 'society', 'collapsed', 'few', 'survivors', 'face', 'daily', 'battle', 'get', 'remaining', 'food', 'just', 'survive', 'Elvis', 'Scott', 'Peat', 'Transformers', 'contact', 'Tweeter', 'Marissa', 'Merrill', 'adopted', 'young', 'boy', 'called', 'Toady', 'names', 'are', 'original', 'decide', 'safety', 'numbers.Well', 'Elvis', 'made', 'deal', 'get', 'boat', 'enough', 'fuel', 'get', 'island', 'allegedly', 'Zombie', 'free', 'go', 'point', 'time', 'Zombies', 'can', 'only', 'shuffle', 'around', 'normal', 'way', 'are', 'beginning', 'mutate', 'reports', 'are', 'coming', 'have', 'managed', 'evolve', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'athletic.Once', 'island', 'discover', 'what', 'were', 'told', 'was', 'not', 'clear', 'representation', 'facts', 'daily', 'struggle', 'worse', 'are', 'loads', 'Zombie', 'films', 'do', 'new', 'take', 'genre', 'try', 'gore', 'fans', 'there', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'here', 'hold', 'full', 'attention', 'much', 'movie', 'deals', 'relationships', 'non', 'Zombies', 'how', 'are', 'coping', 'mental', 'trauma', 'However', 'film', 'actually', 'better', 'Zombie', 'menace', 'never', 'very', 'far', 'away', 'influencing', 'everything', 'else.This', 'well', 'acted', 'directed', 'film', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'overly', 'inventive', 'actually', 'fine', 'Zombie', 'purists', 'have', 'seen', 'very', 'un', 'Zombie', 'behaviour', 'few', 'late', 'Dead', 'Heads', 'name', 'one', 'Still', 'like', 'good', 'character', 'study', 'Zombie', 'action', 'market', 'yes', 'bought', 'gore', 'market', 'Mexico', 'gore', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy']",Dead Season
