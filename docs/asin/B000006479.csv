492958,A2QD4VQQGZDLBP,B000006479,"Cheryl Meril ""Jesus Saves!""","[19, 19]","I disagree on many points with the 1 star reviewer of this noble film about women and their valiant contributions as war nurses during WWII.I believe this movie had strong performances and that it is a significant one in how few movies portray a women's experience and view of war. For this reason, trashing this movie isn't fair. Sure, it isn't a ""great"" war film and some of the portrayals of Japanese aren't realistic and even laughable. However, I have to say that this movie clearly stated in the beginning it was a fictional account and was created in order to show how valiant many women acted during war. The one star reviewer was unfair in their assessment of this movie as a result. Acting needs to be considered when making such a review and he did not factor that in fairly in their overall rating.I treasure this movie, especially Kristy McNichol's performance. This movie is between a 3-5 depending on how one chooses to view it. I give it a 5 because of its unique message and content, and because the acting was superb. Anyone who gives it under 3 stars perhaps is more upset at how men are portrayed in this film -- not a typical depiction in a war movie. Men are sometimes humiliated, but really they only humiliate themselves.",5,Movie Does Justice to Women,1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,1245,"['disagree', 'many', 'points', '1', 'star', 'reviewer', 'noble', 'film', 'women', 'valiant', 'contributions', 'war', 'nurses', 'WWII.I', 'believe', 'movie', 'had', 'strong', 'performances', 'significant', 'one', 'how', 'few', 'movies', 'portray', 'women', 'experience', 'view', 'war', 'reason', 'trashing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'fair', 'Sure', ""n't"", 'great', 'war', 'film', 'portrayals', 'Japanese', 'are', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'even', 'laughable', 'However', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'clearly', 'stated', 'beginning', 'was', 'fictional', 'account', 'was', 'created', 'order', 'show', 'how', 'valiant', 'many', 'women', 'acted', 'war', 'one', 'star', 'reviewer', 'was', 'unfair', 'assessment', 'movie', 'result', 'Acting', 'needs', 'be', 'considered', 'when', 'making', 'review', 'did', 'not', 'factor', 'fairly', 'overall', 'rating.I', 'treasure', 'movie', 'especially', 'Kristy', 'McNichol', 'performance', 'movie', '3-5', 'depending', 'how', 'one', 'view', 'give', '5', 'unique', 'message', 'content', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Anyone', 'who', '3', 'stars', 'perhaps', 'more', 'upset', 'how', 'men', 'are', 'portrayed', 'film', 'not', 'typical', 'depiction', 'war', 'movie', 'Men', 'are', 'sometimes', 'humiliated', 'really', 'only', 'humiliate']",N/A

Even though the movie is not based on fact it does expose conditions and acts of courage that women really did take part in and never got the credit for.  It shows the true courage of women and what they are willing to put themselves to in the name of duty and for country.,5,war film,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",2013,395,"['dramatic', 'film', 'indepth', 'look', 'what', 'women', 'went', 'serve', 'country', 'World', 'War', '2', 'Even', 'movie', 'not', 'based', 'fact', 'expose', 'conditions', 'acts', 'courage', 'women', 'really', 'did', 'take', 'part', 'never', 'got', 'credit', 'true', 'courage', 'women', 'what', 'are', 'willing', 'put', 'name', 'duty', 'country']",N/A

The war went by awfully fast for these women and right when they needed something the most, the &#34; American/ Japanese &#34;commander came through for them. I realise that this movie is for entertainment, but what the real nurses and civilians went through just to survive the war on this island the movie never shows. I found movies like Sisters of War, Paradise Road and the mini series Tenko show what war for these women was really like.",3,not much hardship for these gals,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",2013,476,"['found', 'movie', 'unbelievable', 'war', 'went', 'awfully', 'fast', 'women', 'right', 'when', 'needed', 'something', 'most', '34', 'American/', 'Japanese', '34', 'commander', 'came', 'realise', 'movie', 'entertainment', 'what', 'real', 'nurses', 'civilians', 'went', 'through', 'just', 'survive', 'war', 'island', 'movie', 'never', 'found', 'movies', 'Sisters', 'War', 'Paradise', 'Road', 'mini', 'series', 'Tenko', 'show', 'what', 'war', 'women', 'was', 'really', 'like']",N/A

Mcgorm ""tiddles""","[1, 1]","Susan Sarandon plays a fantastic role that everybody played there roles so convincingly that  it's so real, You were in the movie with them, The story is of action, determination to survive and live to tell their story. It's about the war in the Pacific, Not overdone and I have given it an A plus. It's a must see not knowing whats going to happen next, sitting on the edge of your seat suspense, This movie would make a difference to your feelings about war and the sacrifices that was made for our future. A marvellous dvd to watch sitting on your favourite chair with a few munchies and a drink, Great show to share with your comfort pillow next to you. I strongly recommend this movie to all and I will not ruin it by telling you everything about it.
