He had no coffee at work(the supply of water and coffee grounds were both exhausted). What really haunts him is a mistake he made when he was 15. He missed hitting a baseball,the most important of all,at a little league game. So Larry walks into a bar run by a guardian angel(Michael Caine). The guardian angel turns Larry's life around. In the dream sequence,Larry sees his now-ex-wife with a new husband and children of their own. He meets his newly divorced father with his(the father's) new girlfriend. Also he tries to get into his house to find out it's now owned by a mean-spirited fella. One of Larry's co-workers(Jon Lovitz) has been Larry's pal since childhood. They reminisce about seeing ""Bonnie & Clyde"" in the movie theaters eight times. Another one of Larry's co-workers is a scam artist who later confessed to his wrongdoing and was terminated. Best of all,Larry has a 35th birthday party at his home. Out of the dream sequence,Larry and his wife Ellen(Rene Russo) are still married. In an earlier scene,when the Burrowses were kids,Ellen hands Larry a handkerchief with her embroidered initials on it. They read EJR which stands for Ellen Jane Ripley. Larry,in his baseball uniform,shed a few tears after his failure to hit that important baseball.

But remember that it was Jimmy Stewart, not the story, that shot the original flick into the stratosphere. Likewise, it was Belushi who gave this one legs. Hamilton and Lovitz weren't too shabby, either. And Michael Caine - forget about it!Still, the story is great in and of itself. I guess the message here is that it's not the bad breaks in life that determine your happiness, rather it's the choices you make afterwards. I thought the concept of ""destiny"" whispering in your ear was over the top, but otherwise a very enjoyable movie.Thankfully the writers restrained from heaping on schmaltz or morality lessons. Belushi got a [virtual] second chance - something we all wish for. What he did afterwards was up to him, and so the story ends.

It is like a soap bubble--amusing, attractive but ephemeral. It isn't bad. With Jim Belushi's easy-going charm and an outstanding group of supporting actors, how could it be? My favorite scene involves one of those supporting actors (Maury Chaykin) and Belushi in a hilarious negotiation over paving the driveway. ""There's a mud guy?"" And the movie can make us think about how we wistfully look back at the choices and events of our lives, but I think other stories (""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Frequency"") or poems (""The Road Not Taken"") do a much better job of that.

C'mon, get outta here. They could not possibly think THAT up in Hollywood, could they? Well, Mr. Destiny, played by Michael Caine, offers James Belushi a chance to be a wealthy corporate hot shot instead of a regular James. As you can imagine, it does not work our well for James. You know, self-loathing, John Lovitz (a friend) almost commits suicide--the usual stuff. The movie has funny moments, and the pace is pretty good. The ending is somewhat predictable, James is happy to be a regular James (again). It's not all about the money.
