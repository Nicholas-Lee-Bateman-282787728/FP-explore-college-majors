The boys in this movie are the utmost perfect voices and tones for any singing group. These boys are very talented and never mess up a note. I always wished to be part of the Vienna Choir when I was a kid. This movie stars one of my favorite actors from my favorite monster film (Gorgo) Vincent Winter. This boy was so talented and became a big part in the motion picture industry. I was so pleased to be able to find this movie again after 30 plus years on dvd with a gorgeous technicolour print used.

It concerns a boy, Tony Fiala (Vincent Winter), wanting to become a member of the Vienna Boys' Choir, in spite of his father's objections.  The father is a tyrant for only a few minutes (""I won't have it!"") before giving in, and eventually, supporting his son whole heartedly.  There are a few vain attempts to interject some subtle conflict into the story but it never rises to any great level.  Tony may be expelled for poor grades, but isn't.  Tony has a rival (Sean Scully as Peter Schaefer) who can't seem to manage to make any of his dirty tricks seem vicious enough to warrant being a villain.  They become buddies.  There's more music than plot.  It's all done in good humor.  These kids get to live in a palace for pity sake!  How hard of a life could that be!?  The most trouble they get into is a pillow fight.

It was absolutely stunning; the visuals of the Vienna scenery are lovely, but it is the music and the voices of the Vienna Boys Choir that make this film soar.I am female, but I am also a singer and have sung in choirs since I was the age of the boys in this film and even though this movie was made so many years ago, I recall it as if it were yesterday and I could identify with the characters and the love of music and choral singing just as well as if I were male. This is a movie for all choral music lovers.Like others who have written their comments here, I too am disappointed that Disney still has not made this movie available in DVD and, better yet, in Blu-ray (can you imagine that scenery and those glorious voices in H-D and Surround-sound format??)It would do me no good to buy the film now in VHS; times have changed and I have not used a VHS player in years, but this film should not be lost to us because the technology has changed but the studio has not kept pace.This movie should not be forgotten! It needs to be reformatted to DVD so that the glorious music and the poignant story of a young man whose voice is changing but whose heart is not will not be lost forever.

630621,AOMEZP13H0MQC,B00005JNF2,Warmgoy,"[2, 2]","I stumbled across this old Disney film recently. I remember it vividly from childhood, or at least I remembered bits of it, and coming back to it over forty years later, I realize now it was likely one of a number of important early childhood influences that implanted a love of classical music in my little brain. It is a charming film, about a boy who joins the Vienna Boy's Choir, and learns a lot about life and friendship as well as music. The lead is child actor Vincent Winter, who appeared in a few other Disney films and later became a very successful producer. He sadly passed away in his fifties. The other primary role is played by child actor Sean Scully. He did some other Disney things (a wonderful version of The Prince and the Pauper, for one), then grew up to be a very handsome man and successful adult performer in Britain and Australia. I remember him from that steamy series The Prisoner in Cellblock 8 among other things. This little movie seems to have been a major formative influence for many, many people who later became involved in music in one way or another.  Really one of those quiet little mini-masterpieces that likely didn't know its own strength at the time (it was not one of Disney's bigger blockbusters initially) but reveals itself as quite a powerful little artistic force when viewed in retrospect through the passage of time and experience. I was delighted to find it on DVD and was delighted to see it again. The quality of the film is a tad grainy here and there, and yeah, it has its corny moments - nothing wrong with that - but this movie is a total winner. It is a sweet little story on a child level, certainly, but also provides some gentle education about growing up, and changes, and some very positive lessons about nurturing your passions and holding onto them in different ways throughout the life cycle. Very importantly, it introduces some very fine music, lovely pieces by Bach, Schubert, Werner, and many others. I realized seeing it again that this was undoubtedly my first hearing of things like Der Lindenbaum and Heidenroslein.  Wow. Who knew? A very good film. It is not to be found on the cheap, but bite the bullet and get it. Maybe it will jog your kids with a love of music that will gift them throughout their lives.",5,A Sleeper Hit for Childhood and Well Beyond,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",2012,2287,"['stumbled', 'old', 'Disney', 'film', 'recently', 'remember', 'vividly', 'childhood', 'least', 'remembered', 'bits', 'coming', 'back', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'realize', 'now', 'was', 'likely', 'one', 'number', 'important', 'early', 'childhood', 'influences', 'implanted', 'love', 'classical', 'music', 'little', 'brain', 'charming', 'film', 'boy', 'who', 'Vienna', 'Boy', 'Choir', 'lot', 'life', 'friendship', 'as', 'well', 'music', 'lead', 'child', 'actor', 'Vincent', 'Winter', 'who', 'appeared', 'few', 'other', 'Disney', 'films', 'later', 'became', 'very', 'successful', 'producer', 'sadly', 'passed', 'away', 'fifties', 'other', 'primary', 'role', 'played', 'child', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Scully', 'did', 'other', 'Disney', 'things', 'wonderful', 'version', 'Prince', 'Pauper', 'one', 'then', 'grew', 'up', 'be', 'very', 'handsome', 'man', 'successful', 'adult', 'performer', 'Britain', 'Australia', 'remember', 'steamy', 'series', 'Prisoner', 'Cellblock', '8', 'other', 'things', 'little', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'major', 'formative', 'influence', 'many', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'later', 'became', 'involved', 'music', 'one', 'way', 'Really', 'one', 'quiet', 'little', 'mini-masterpieces', 'likely', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'own', 'strength', 'time', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'Disney', 'bigger', 'blockbusters', 'initially', 'quite', 'powerful', 'little', 'artistic', 'force', 'when', 'viewed', 'retrospect', 'passage', 'time', 'experience', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'DVD', 'was', 'delighted', 'see', 'again', 'quality', 'film', 'tad', 'grainy', 'here', 'there', 'yeah', 'corny', 'moments', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'movie', 'total', 'winner', 'sweet', 'little', 'story', 'child', 'level', 'certainly', 'also', 'gentle', 'education', 'growing', 'up', 'changes', 'very', 'positive', 'lessons', 'nurturing', 'passions', 'holding', 'different', 'ways', 'life', 'cycle', 'Very', 'importantly', 'very', 'fine', 'music', 'lovely', 'pieces', 'Bach', 'Schubert', 'Werner', 'many', 'others', 'realized', 'seeing', 'again', 'was', 'undoubtedly', 'first', 'hearing', 'things', 'Der', 'Lindenbaum', 'Heidenroslein', 'Wow', 'Who', 'knew', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'cheap', 'bullet', 'get', 'will', 'jog', 'kids', 'love', 'music', 'will', 'gift', 'lives']",N/A
