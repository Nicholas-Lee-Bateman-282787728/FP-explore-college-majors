They get just about to the ""Kentucky"" section, then hang up and refuse to play or fast forward.  Finally ended up downloading a copy on iTunes to be able to watch the film.  The documentary itself is very good, and I think would be interesting even to people who don't follow horse-racing.  Rather than buy a DVD, I would suggest renting or borrowing it first to see if the DVD will play on your player.",3,"Great content, poor DVD",1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,512,"[""'ve"", 'tried', 'two', 'DVDs', 'documentary', 'one', 'will', 'play', 'entirety', 'Sony', 'DVD', 'player', 'get', 'just', 'Kentucky', 'section', 'then', 'hang', 'up', 'refuse', 'play', 'fast', 'forward', 'Finally', 'ended', 'up', 'downloading', 'copy', 'iTunes', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'film', 'documentary', 'very', 'good', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'even', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'horse-racing', 'Rather', 'buy', 'DVD', 'would', 'suggest', 'renting', 'borrowing', 'first', 'see', 'DVD', 'will', 'play', 'player']",N/A
1186574,A1PQRIRSJGFR1F,B001ESDDGA,Ellzeena,"[2, 3]","I've been watching the Kentucky Derby since I was ten years old.  Honestly, I stopped watching the races after Barbaro's breakdown in the Preakness which is a tragic part of this documentary.  There are many issues regarding the ethics of how we (humans) use and interact with other living creatures on this planet of ours, one of them being (obviously) the thoroughbred horse.  If (huge ""IF"") these horses are ""correct"" in type and temperament, they WANT to run, they NEED to run, but WHY should they?  Larger question than I can answer and certainly not part of the review of a DVD.Happily (for me, anyway) Barbaro's breakdown was NOT part of this DVD; bad enough we already know the tragic outcome.  What WAS part of it was a brief interlude with Barbaro (then recovering, just prior to his euthanasia) and an owner, who seemed genuinely concerned and obviously spent an enormous amount of money to save this horse's life.  I wonder what happened to Achilles of Troy, who also broke down (with a torn tendon) during one of the races portrayed: did his owners KILL HIM (i.e., euthanize) because of this injury?  There are many, many owners who DO just this: use the horse with obvious and ubiquitous threat of serious injury then end its life when its ""racing career"" is over.  This is an indictment of our species, in my opinion.If you have an interest in horse racing, then you MUST know how important the Kentucky Derby is to everyone involved.  This documentary was exceptionally well done, despite the heart rending conclusion: WOULD Barbaro have achieved the Triple Crown?  Jazil was a come-from-behind horse and loved the distance of the Belmont: WOULD he have beat Barbaro because of these things?  We'll never know.",5,Wonderful....but....,1298764800,"02 27, 2011",2011,1726,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'was', 'ten', 'years', 'old', 'Honestly', 'stopped', 'watching', 'races', 'Barbaro', 'breakdown', 'Preakness', 'tragic', 'part', 'documentary', 'are', 'many', 'issues', 'regarding', 'ethics', 'how', 'humans', 'use', 'interact', 'other', 'living', 'creatures', 'planet', 'ours', 'one', 'being', 'obviously', 'thoroughbred', 'horse', 'huge', 'IF', 'horses', 'are', 'correct', 'type', 'temperament', 'WANT', 'run', 'NEED', 'run', 'WHY', 'should', 'Larger', 'question', 'can', 'answer', 'certainly', 'not', 'part', 'review', 'DVD.Happily', 'anyway', 'Barbaro', 'breakdown', 'was', 'NOT', 'part', 'DVD', 'bad', 'already', 'know', 'tragic', 'outcome', 'What', 'WAS', 'part', 'was', 'brief', 'interlude', 'Barbaro', 'then', 'recovering', 'just', 'prior', 'euthanasia', 'owner', 'who', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'concerned', 'obviously', 'spent', 'enormous', 'amount', 'money', 'save', 'horse', 'life', 'wonder', 'what', 'happened', 'Achilles', 'Troy', 'who', 'also', 'broke', 'down', 'torn', 'tendon', 'one', 'races', 'portrayed', 'did', 'owners', 'KILL', 'HIM', 'i.e.', 'euthanize', 'injury', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'owners', 'who', 'DO', 'just', 'use', 'horse', 'obvious', 'ubiquitous', 'threat', 'serious', 'injury', 'then', 'end', 'life', 'when', 'racing', 'career', 'over', 'indictment', 'species', 'opinion.If', 'have', 'interest', 'horse', 'racing', 'then', 'MUST', 'know', 'how', 'important', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'everyone', 'involved', 'documentary', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'done', 'heart', 'rending', 'conclusion', 'WOULD', 'Barbaro', 'have', 'achieved', 'Triple', 'Crown', 'Jazil', 'was', 'come-from-behind', 'horse', 'loved', 'distance', 'Belmont', 'WOULD', 'have', 'beat', 'Barbaro', 'things', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know']",N/A
1186575,A2XR4C4TOS3XS1,B001ESDDGA,"Jim Altfeld ""Management Consultant""","[0, 0]","This was one of the four years I was doing consulting work at Santa Anita.  As a result, I was able to see Brother Derek and Dan Hendricks up close and personal.  I also had the fun job of spending a couple of hours with Merv Griffin sporting his lucky yellow tie, the owner of Stevie Wonder Boy, who unfortunately came up hurt that day.  The tragedy of Barabaro and what the horse and owners courageously tried to do was commendable.  In the long run, what was learned from that experience has been and will continue to be applied to horses since the time of Barbaro's breaking down.  I think the most emotional moment for me that year was being with Laffit Pincay, Jr. when we were about to sign the Get Well Card to Barbaro from Santa Anita.  At the last moment, Laffit, always a class act, decided to wait because he wanted to choose his words carefully. All told, it's a very well done video that points out the difficulties of just getting to the Derby, much less actually winning it.  It also points out the frailty of the horse.  And if you ever want to know what this sport means to the people involved in it, not only watch this video, but attend the HOF induction in Saratoga on the first Friday in August.  It's pretty emotional.",4,Dejavu All Over Again!,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",2013,1241,"['was', 'one', 'four', 'years', 'was', 'doing', 'consulting', 'work', 'Santa', 'Anita', 'result', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'Brother', 'Derek', 'Dan', 'Hendricks', 'up', 'close', 'personal', 'also', 'had', 'fun', 'job', 'spending', 'couple', 'hours', 'Merv', 'Griffin', 'sporting', 'lucky', 'yellow', 'tie', 'owner', 'Stevie', 'Wonder', 'Boy', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'came', 'up', 'hurt', 'day', 'tragedy', 'Barabaro', 'what', 'horse', 'owners', 'courageously', 'tried', 'do', 'was', 'commendable', 'long', 'run', 'what', 'was', 'learned', 'experience', 'been', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'applied', 'horses', 'time', 'Barbaro', 'breaking', 'down', 'think', 'most', 'emotional', 'moment', 'year', 'was', 'being', 'Laffit', 'Pincay', 'Jr.', 'when', 'were', 'about', 'sign', 'Get', 'Well', 'Card', 'Barbaro', 'Santa', 'Anita', 'last', 'moment', 'Laffit', 'always', 'class', 'act', 'decided', 'wait', 'wanted', 'choose', 'words', 'carefully', 'told', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'video', 'out', 'difficulties', 'just', 'getting', 'Derby', 'much', 'less', 'actually', 'winning', 'also', 'out', 'frailty', 'horse', 'ever', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'sport', 'people', 'involved', 'not', 'only', 'watch', 'video', 'attend', 'HOF', 'induction', 'Saratoga', 'first', 'Friday', 'August', 'pretty', 'emotional']",N/A

1186578,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B001ESDDGA,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[15, 16]","(Note: originally reviewed February 2008.)The First Saturday in May (The Hennegan Brothers, 2008)Sometimes synchronicity works in mysterious ways. The Hennegan Brothers set out to film a documentary about trainers trying to get their horses to the Kentucky Derby (of 40,000 foals born in the U.S. Every year, a maximum of twenty make it to the Derby), and they happened to choose the year that spawned one of the most-followed sports stories of the new century: Barbaro. Talk about lucking out.Despite this being a movie about the Kentucky Derby, it's far less about the horses than it is about the humans. The movie focuses on the trainers of six horses who are on the Derby trail: Lawyer Ron (Bob Holthus), Achilles of Troy (Frank Amonte, Jr.),  Brother Derek (Dan Hendricks), Jazil (Kieran McLaughlin), and Barbaro (Michael Matz). The Hennegan Brothers spend a good deal of time in the shedrow and on the backstretch with the trainers and their families, just talking horses. It's the personalities of the trainers, and the stories surrounding them, that make this movie so watchable. We do get to see highlights from the races that get the horses into the Derby, but the movie doesn't really focus on the horses until the Derby itself, at which point we get a condensed version of the post-Derby Barbaro saga that everyone who's ever watched two minutes of ESPN seemed to follow.It's probably the faintest possible criticism, maybe even a left-handed compliment, to say that a movie should have been longer. That's the case here; as much as I enjoyed the stories behind the horses, they came in a manner that seemed a bit on the impressionist side. Great approach for making a horror movie. Not so much a documentary. And it would have been nice to get a little more focus on the horses; it is, after all, a movie about getting to the Derby. (At the very least, full films of the races shown would have been nice.) When the movie does focus on the races the horses need to run to make bank for the Derby, it gets somewhat choppy. Trying to follow six horses in a ninety-seven minute film is bound to do that. A two-hour running time might have worked better. (Brad Hennegan said the original cut of the movie is three and a half hours long; I'd give my right arm for a copy of that cut.) Still, it's a minor annoyance; this is a movie well worth watching for horse fans (and, judging by the reactions of some of the audience, who made it clear in pre-film chatter they didn't know from racing, even for non-horse fans).The movie's been stumping along the festival circuit, but it will be getting a nationwide release on April 18th. Check it out-- it's worth it. ****",4,"Could have been better, but still good.",1223596800,"10 10, 2008",2008,2670,"['Note', 'originally', 'reviewed', 'February', '2008', 'First', 'Saturday', 'May', 'Hennegan', 'Brothers', '2008', 'Sometimes', 'synchronicity', 'mysterious', 'ways', 'Hennegan', 'Brothers', 'set', 'out', 'film', 'documentary', 'trainers', 'trying', 'get', 'horses', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', '40,000', 'foals', 'born', 'U.S.', 'Every', 'year', 'maximum', 'twenty', 'make', 'Derby', 'happened', 'choose', 'year', 'spawned', 'one', 'most-followed', 'sports', 'stories', 'new', 'century', 'Barbaro', 'Talk', 'lucking', 'out.Despite', 'being', 'movie', 'Kentucky', 'Derby', 'far', 'less', 'horses', 'humans', 'movie', 'trainers', 'six', 'horses', 'who', 'are', 'Derby', 'trail', 'Lawyer', 'Ron', 'Bob', 'Holthus', 'Achilles', 'Troy', 'Frank', 'Amonte', 'Jr.', 'Brother', 'Derek', 'Dan', 'Hendricks', 'Jazil', 'Kieran', 'McLaughlin', 'Barbaro', 'Michael', 'Matz', 'Hennegan', 'Brothers', 'spend', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'shedrow', 'backstretch', 'trainers', 'families', 'just', 'talking', 'horses', 'personalities', 'trainers', 'stories', 'surrounding', 'make', 'movie', 'so', 'watchable', 'do', 'get', 'see', 'highlights', 'races', 'get', 'horses', 'Derby', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'focus', 'horses', 'Derby', 'point', 'get', 'condensed', 'version', 'post-Derby', 'Barbaro', 'saga', 'everyone', 'who', 'ever', 'watched', 'two', 'minutes', 'ESPN', 'seemed', 'follow.It', 'probably', 'faintest', 'possible', 'criticism', 'maybe', 'even', 'left-handed', 'compliment', 'say', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'longer', 'case', 'here', 'as', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'stories', 'horses', 'came', 'manner', 'seemed', 'bit', 'impressionist', 'side', 'Great', 'approach', 'making', 'horror', 'movie', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'documentary', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'get', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'horses', 'movie', 'getting', 'Derby', 'very', 'least', 'full', 'films', 'races', 'shown', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'When', 'movie', 'focus', 'races', 'horses', 'need', 'run', 'make', 'bank', 'Derby', 'somewhat', 'choppy', 'Trying', 'follow', 'six', 'horses', 'ninety-seven', 'minute', 'film', 'bound', 'do', 'two-hour', 'running', 'time', 'might', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'Brad', 'Hennegan', 'said', 'original', 'cut', 'movie', 'three', 'half', 'hours', 'long', ""'d"", 'give', 'right', 'arm', 'copy', 'cut', 'Still', 'minor', 'annoyance', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', 'horse', 'fans', 'judging', 'reactions', 'audience', 'who', 'made', 'clear', 'pre-film', 'chatter', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'racing', 'even', 'non-horse', 'fans', '.The', 'movie', 'been', 'stumping', 'festival', 'circuit', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'nationwide', 'release', 'April', '18th', 'Check', 'out', '****']",N/A
