And what a novel to start with:  The Cider House Rules is a beautifully written ode to love. But read the book, then watch the film.  You'll be amazingly disappointed at what was important and beautiful in the novel has become cheap and Hollywood-ized in the film (especially the ending).  I missed this film during Oscar-hype and kept vowing to see it, then bought the DVD since I enjoyed the book so much.  I was keenly disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, though.  On its own, the Cider House Rules film is a nice work of motion picture, with well-written dialogue, beautiful cinematography, and good performances.  But to see what Irving did to his novel (in what I'm assuming is the interest of time and to give the film a more traditional happy ending) is to see utter disappointment in this film.

So it's difficult to say that the film doesn't stay true to the novel.  I watched the film before I read the novel, and I could tell there were things missing.

483996,ACAO2J1XCS4FL,6305949638,Alexander Suraev,"[0, 5]","John Irving used to write great books - not many works that belong to a ""Modern Fiction"" shelf sell in millions. But the novels' inhabitants - the endearing misfits having their clashes with reality -  had a very bad time translating into movie characters. Robin Williams as Garp is just a huge tasteless joke.The author's later offerings are less memorable and way too long. They feel stillborn, lifeless, though there are still some glimpses of John Irving we love. I've stopped reading his books with The Son Of The Circus. When a new novel comes out I leaf through it for an hour and put back on the shelf - I'd like to remember the writer in his prime.I had a definite impression that John Irving drifts into obscurity, into the void of artsy vagueness. And all of a sudden I see him clutching the golden guy with a sword, riding the Oscar hypewave.The author made a script out of his last great novel, leaving all the originality behind. What we have now is the simplistic Coming Of Age/Period Piece Hollywood movie that tackle for a couple minutes some serious issues. Michael Cain is good, he delivers ""the performance you can always rely on"". He is evidently out of his league in this cast. Toby McGuire is a nice young actor, but he seem to have just one facial expression available and the more times he puts it on the less endearing it looks. Evidently, Charlize Theron has not arrived to the stage, where she is no longer required to sell a film with her body - which is perfectly OK with me, but that the-beauty-spreads-across-the-sheets scene looks like a bonus.Well, to make it shorter - I do not regret seeing the movie  just as I would not regret skipping it.",3,The Cider House Rules Decaffeinated.,972432000,"10 25, 2000",2000,1677,"['John', 'Irving', 'used', 'write', 'great', 'books', 'not', 'many', 'works', 'belong', 'Modern', 'Fiction', 'shelf', 'sell', 'millions', 'novels', 'inhabitants', 'endearing', 'misfits', 'having', 'clashes', 'reality', 'had', 'very', 'bad', 'time', 'translating', 'movie', 'characters', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Garp', 'just', 'huge', 'tasteless', 'joke.The', 'author', 'later', 'offerings', 'are', 'less', 'memorable', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'feel', 'stillborn', 'lifeless', 'are', 'still', 'glimpses', 'John', 'Irving', 'love', ""'ve"", 'stopped', 'reading', 'books', 'Son', 'Circus', 'When', 'new', 'novel', 'out', 'leaf', 'hour', 'put', 'back', 'shelf', ""'d"", 'like', 'remember', 'writer', 'prime.I', 'had', 'definite', 'impression', 'John', 'Irving', 'drifts', 'obscurity', 'void', 'artsy', 'vagueness', 'sudden', 'see', 'clutching', 'golden', 'guy', 'sword', 'riding', 'Oscar', 'hypewave.The', 'author', 'made', 'script', 'last', 'great', 'novel', 'leaving', 'originality', 'What', 'have', 'now', 'simplistic', 'Coming', 'Age/Period', 'Piece', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'tackle', 'couple', 'minutes', 'serious', 'issues', 'Michael', 'Cain', 'good', 'performance', 'can', 'always', 'rely', 'evidently', 'league', 'cast', 'Toby', 'McGuire', 'nice', 'young', 'actor', 'seem', 'have', 'just', 'one', 'facial', 'expression', 'available', 'more', 'times', 'less', 'endearing', 'Evidently', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'not', 'arrived', 'stage', 'where', 'no', 'longer', 'required', 'sell', 'film', 'body', 'perfectly', 'OK', 'the-beauty-spreads-across-the-sheets', 'scene', 'bonus.Well', 'make', 'shorter', 'do', 'not', 'regret', 'seeing', 'movie', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'regret', 'skipping']",The Cider House Rules VHS

The script is an excellent, if abridged, version of the novel and the cast perform wonderfully under Hallstrom's direction.The story is a reasonably slow-moving, character-driven one.

It also didn't age well with me.  Within minutes of leaving the theatre, I was bothered by awkward moments that didn't fit, or by the over-cuteness of those gosh-darn-adorable little orphans.  Problem is, the movie's not about those adorable orphans, or the equally adorable and interesting Doctor played by Michael Caine, but about a far less interesting story and place, complete with a glamour shot of Charlize Theron's all-over tanned backside.This was just not a great movie.  It's a completely adequate one, and an enjoyable couple of hours.  But there's nothing all that deep or interesting about it, save for a quietly wonderful performance by Caine that I actually think seems better than it is, simply because the rest of the movie is so curiously bland.Sure it offers cute orphans, sexy Charlize Theron, and some sticky ethical issues deep in all the candy coating. But for the first time director Lasse Hallstrom fell flat for me.  The movie looks like a gooey Hallmark car with a not-so-sweet center.And while Tobey Maguire is simply terrific with a part that would have seemed bland in any other hands, the fact is that he's hopelessly mismatched with Theron, who looks at least ten years older -- and hopelessly glamorous -- when set next to this sweet cracker kid.  Theron is beautiful but she is utterly unconvincing as a &quot;simple lobsterman's daughter&quot; and seems to belong in a completely different movie.  Even her wardrobe is the kind of overglamorous stuff Marilyn Monroe would have loved.  (How many lobsters does Dad catch, anyway?)I love John Irving's books, and loved the novel this is based on, but I think this whole &quot;Summer of 42&quot; angle for the film hurt it.  And because I couldn't seriously see this gorgeous movie-idol woman choosing too-young-to-shave Maguire (and the romance itself is clunky and sparkless in its depiction), the whole movie didn't stand up well, and went downhill fast after.I was also really unhappy that a film this mediocre would be chosen as a nominee for Best Picture (but again, Miramax knows how to spend those &quot;for your consideration&quot; ad dollars).  When measured against wonderful films of last year which should have been nominated for the Best Picture spot instead, such as &quot;Magnolia,&quot; or &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley,&quot; or even &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; -- &quot;Cider House&quot; is already being recognized as overpraised and hopelessly outclassed.  (I actually couldn't help but wonder if some of these other ecstatic customer reviews actually came from the PR machine at Miramax.)Unless you loved the book, don't spend the bucks, but wait to catch it for free on cable.

484004,AE8RQHFMSLN0D,6305949638,"Anthony Damato ""Law professor""","[4, 5]","THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a movie that could have been made in the 1940s, starring Gene Tierney and Montgomery Clift.  I found it fascinating that  Hollywood would turn out a movie like this these days--an absorbing  character study of several complex personalities in an unusual setting.  Unlike the reviewers who have written their reviews before me, I think the  &quot;abortion&quot; issue was extremely well done because it was not used  for preachiness but for character development.  Except for a few moments  when the movie lagged a bit, it was certainly one of the most  &quot;absorbing&quot; movies lately released, and that's why it has that  relentless drive of the better movies of the 1940s.  I bought this DVD  because Leonard Maltin gave it four stars, and whenever he gives four stars  to any movie, I've never ever been disappointed when I viewed it.  I don't  really agree with Maltin that this is one of the greatest movies ever made  (which is the category I keep for my own five star reviews on Amazon), but  it is certainly a beautiful blend of story, cinematography, setting,  character development, superb ensemble acting, a sure hand at the  directorial chair, a good score, wonderful story development through the  titles (a sure sign of a careful film!), and almost, but not quite, superb  editing.  And welcome back, Michael Caine and Kate Nelligan--two of the  greatest actors of our era, still going strong in roles that are wonderful  for them!

Engaging and touching throughout, it pulls you in immediately and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's going to happen next.  Lasse Hallstrom's direction is just right, and the film is cast equally well.  Michael Caine does a great job (big surprise) as Dr. Wilbur Larch, the director of the Maine orphanage where a great deal of the story takes place.  He certainly deserved his Oscar for this role, and if I had seen the movie before that year's awards I certainly would have been rooting for him!Charlize Theron is just right for the part of Candy, as is Paul Rudd as her husband Wally.  Singer Erykah Badu turns in an impressive performance as the daughter of the owner of the titular cider house.  But, in my opinion, the nicest  part of this film is Tobey Maguire, who plays the central character, Homer Wells.  The role seems to have been written for him.  Having seen him previously in &quot;Spider-Man,&quot; I wasn't really left with any particular impression of his abilities as an actor, but this movie totally sold me on him.  I'll watch anything else he's in now - who knows, I wouldn't even be surprised to find myself sitting through &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.To sum up, this is a really worthwhile, multifaceted film - sometimes heartwarming, sometimes heartbreaking (and sometimes both at once, which means you have a warm broken heart...).

484008,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6305949638,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is a very thoughtful movie, with many layers of meaning. I think I'll have to see it a couple more times to get them all.Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) was born in a Maine orphanage of an unwed mother. His first adoptive parents soon returned him because ""he didn't make a sound."" Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), director of the orphanage, concluded that he was returned because he was ""too happy."" The second set of adoptive parents got him to cry: they beat him. After Dr. Larch rescued him from them, he decided to keep him at the orphanage and raise Homer as his own. You get an early appreciation of Dr. Larch's attitude from a couple of things; he reads a chapter of a book to the children every night at bedtime, and he turns off the light saying, ""Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.""Homer thus grew up being Dr. Larch's assistant, which was useful in part because Dr. Larch was in the habit of putting himself to sleep by pouring ether on a filter mask. Also, Dr. Larch performed abortions when needed, which Homer would not help, as well as deliveries. Homer learned to deliver babies very well, and helped take care of the smaller children, and generally was very smart and capable. Indeed, Dr. Larch figured he was already a competent ob/gyn, even though he had little schooling. I suppose he would have been called a midwife but for the gender issue.One day an attractive young couple came to the orphanage so that the girl, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) could have an abortion. Her lover, Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) was about to return to active duty on the ""Burma Run."" He was a pilot and this was WWII.When they left, Homer asked them to give him a ride, not even caring where they were going. Turns out they were going to the coast, where Wally's mother, a widow, ran an apple orchard and cider house, and Candy's father was a lobster man. Homer had never seen the ocean, never seen a lobster, never done much of anything. But Wally's mother needed apple pickers, so she gave him a job. He was the only white picker, and they all lived in a bunkhouse in the cider house during harvest time.The cider house rules were posted on a piece of paper in the bunk house, but none of the other pickers could read. When Homer started reading them out, Mr. Rose, the foreman, said they didn't need them. In fact, he doesn't finish reading them out until near the end of the film.How Homer gets on with the apple picking and everything else, and finally returns to the orphanage as a grown man, is the basis of the story. If I haven't given too much away by saying that he eventually returns, perhaps I would if I told you the circumstances. You have to see it.Even if the only reason was to see the adorable children who play the orphans, and have the novel experience of a story about orphans who are not exploited or mistreated, it would be worthwhile.

Although it wasn't difficult watching Charlize  Theron in the scenes, she just seemed a too worldly wise and mature to be  the boyish Tobey Maguire's lover.All that aside, this movie was a very  pleasant distraction and was oddly fulfilling. The kids in the orphanage  were charming, especially poor little Fuzzy.

What is the point of laws and alternatively rules, if they are not helping those whom they are trying to help? It talks about sex impulse, about incest and abortion( in a forgiving way ), whether we should legalise abortion or whether we prefer more and more abandoned orphans grown up to be torn apart between the forces of the wish to find and show their biological parents how well they are now doing on the one hand, and ""killing them"" for abandoning them on the other, that is to say if they are lucky enough to get that far. How are they supposed to find their place in this world? Take note how Dr Larch prepared and launched Homer (and others: i.e. ""Kings of New England"") into this world.So, once upon a time in a forlorn small place called Maine, there were some orphans who strived to survive and one of then chanced to intermingle with the folks in the fishing industry and the cider industry not too far away. A perfect fragment of this broken tiny Universe, a perfect elegy for Dr Larch.Well, this is more like a vivid watercolour painting of this part of the Universe with characters so round and so real; not just Dr Larch or Homer, but also the Lieutenant and his girlfriend (Charlize Theron), and even the two Roses. The watercolour effects are well deployed. The sights of the operation theatre(s) full of apparatus with the pregnant women in bed would otherwise be too stupefying. Furthermore, there are so many scenes of premature deaths of the orphans and then the tragic ending of Mr Rose etc. Have they been depicted in the oil like ""My Life as a Dog,"" the impact would simply be too shocking. Moreover, the way how it is depicted now would suggest some sort of intransience, some kind of timelessness.All in all, the film is enchanting and thought provoking all at the same time.

Released at Christmas time with massive publicity by Miramax, this is a totally average film that audiences just lapped up.Michael Caine plays  a mild mannered doctor who is also the head of a New England orphanage. The  films driving force lies between the relationship of Caine and Tobey  Maguire, an orphan of his. As Tobey grows, Caine teaches him how to be a  doctor. Caine also notices that Maguire has an uncharacteristically good  relationship with the other orphans, very Father like.As Maguire grows  he longs to experince life away from the orphanage. He discovers romance  while assuming a job as an apple picker. Along the way he is caught in a  web of secrets and lies involving his new co-workers (Delroy Lindo doing a  bad job.)There are, I suppose several surprises to The Cider House  Rules. None of them are particularly earth shattering but I will not spoil  them anyway.That just about sums up the general idea to The Cider House  Rules.When it ended I was forced to ask myself why so many people liked  this film? The answer lies in the same reason so many embraced The Green  Mile. &quot;Cider House,&quot; like The Green Mile is a cliche ridden movie  that manipulates the audience throughout. It has a warm fuzzy feeling to it  that is the type of thing that mainstream audiences seem to  love.Unfortunately I found that the movie was dull, boring and  uninspired. Caine is good but not Oscar worthy and everything about this  film is totally average.I especially despised the &quot;Kings of New  England&quot; line that was repeated throughout by Michael Caine.

Michael Caine plays Dr. Wilbur Larch, a self-medicating doctor who is both the head of an orphanage and an illegal abortion provider.  One of the orphanage's residents is Homer Wells, played by Tobey Maguire.  Alas, Homer is all grown up now because he was never adopted out.  He is a medical assistant for Dr. Larch, who has sort of taken on a paternal role for Homer.  Homer is more than happy to help out Dr. Larch but he refuses to perform any of the abortions.  Dr. Larch spends much of the first half of the film trying to tell Homer how noble and good for mankind abortions are.This brings us to the second half of the film.  Candy, played by Charlize Theron, comes to the orphanage/abortion clinic and gets an abortion.  Homer becomes a bit enamored with Candy and at the same time has an inner desire to get away from the only place he has ever known and see the world.  He asks Candy's boyfriend if he can accompany them back to wherever they are going.  Homer ends up becoming a humble apple picker and one day is faced with the inevitable.  **SPOILER**  This really isn't much of a spoiler because it is painfully obvious from the start what is going to happen.  Homer encounters a young woman who is a victim of incest.  Of course, she is now pregnant from her father's dirty deeds.  Homer has his epiphany and sees how important abortions are and provides one for her.  Thankfully, the movie is soon over afterwards.Don't let anyone tell you that the real story of ""The Cider House Rules"" isn't actually about abortion.  They'll tell you it is really about a young man's journey of personal self-discovery or similar tripe.  This movie could so easily have been that except that every few minutes the topic of abortion comes up front and center.

Ebeling ""ctlpareader""","[2, 3]","The title, &quot;The Cider House Rules,&quot; refers to a list of &quot;Don'ts&quot; posted in the bunk house where migrant apple pickers stay on a New England farm near the sea, in the early 1940's.  The illiterate workers have stayed there for years not knowing what the rules are.  When the list is finally read to them, it turns out they've been breaking them for years.  They are small rules, like don't eat lunch on the roof.  They have no meaning.  Meanwhile, a very serious, unwritten rule with consequences has quietly been broken.  This becomes the metaphor for the primary story of an orphan who grows up apprenticed to the doctor who takes in homeless children or performs abortions, depending upon what is asked or needed.  For the orphan, the latter is not an option because it cancels out the meaning of his own life.  When he takes off to explore the world, without ever leaving Maine, he discovers that making meaning is a very difficult, chaotic process.For a film that celebrates simplicity, The Cider House Rules is difficult to sum up in a small space.  In episodes that are deft (&quot;stark&quot; others have said), even fleeting, there can be a thicket of symbolism and feeling that defy easy description.  A strong hand keeps this on the humane side, rather than the sentimental.  It is not oppressive, though.  The acting is wonderful; Michael Caine is splendid as a man who makes it his business to try to elevate the saddest problems in life to the most meaningful.  Each night, he says a sincere good night to the cast-off children, imparting a rhythm of safety and grandeur to their lives, though he is well aware of the fragility of life.Though I've have not read the book and can't compare it, this must be a good case of the text surviving the camera.

It was heartwarming, painful, gentle, brutal, tragic, uplifting.  Homer Wells is the touchstone for all of those feelings, and I just wish I could put it better than that.""An innocent abroad"" is not all there is to it....Homer is a blank slate in all respects but one.  At approximately 20, he's almost a child himself, except that he knows everything there is to know about birth, and more than we ordinarily know about its alternative.  His mentor and loving father figure, Dr. Larch, has brought the boy up as a medical prodigy.This is the eager soul who sets out on the road one day from his lifelong shelter at St. Cloud's orphanage, at the sudden impulse driven by love at first sight.  His heart's hope, Candy Kendall, is in a committed relationship to a young man (Wally Worthington) who quickly becomes Homer's best friend.  Homer is an earnest, needy young man with good core values and a helpful disposition.  This combination is a recipe for a complicated life.Situational ethics are at the core of this film.  Homer has to confront his heart in every circumstance, even the literal sense...he is given by Dr. Larch to believe his heart itself is physically vulnerable.  It surely is given spiritual tests of every kind.  Dr. Larch, with completely moral intentions, is in the abortion business (the reason for Candy and Wally's visit to St. Cloud's) as much as in the adoption business.  His fatherly love for Homer allows him to lie to the boy about Homer's own health with a clear conscience.  His belief in giving choices to desperate women allows him to commit felonies (at the time) also with a clear conscience.  Homer understands abortion as a practical need but, as an orphan, develops a personal philosophy against it.  Homer accepts Dr. Larch's practices but won't practice abortion himself.  Homer takes all of this and more with him into the world.It's the story of how people deal with the conflicting values that they believe in.  Candy loves Wally, and she needs Homer.  Homer is an orphan who cherishes life but must confront abortion as a realistic option.  Dr. Larch is a father figure without children of his own, and his need for Homer to succeed him is the need not only of an orphanage director for a sympathetic colleague, but also the need of a doting parent.  There is a lot going on here and it doesn't allow for simple resolution.So months later, I am still coming to terms with it.

484026,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,6305949638,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[6, 8]","`The Cider House Rules' succeeds in delivering a touching and thought provoking melodrama that's only elevated by the prime acting on the part of it's entire cast.  As Homer, Toby Maguire gives one of his better performances, although I still feel that he comes across a bit nervous and uneasy, as if he's not too confident in his own acting ability.  This though is offset by the brilliant acting on the part of his co-stars, like Michael Caine and Charlize Theron who embody their characters and come across like the seasoned veterans we know they are.The film follows Homer, a young orphan who was raised in the Maine orphanage by Dr. Wilber Larch (Caine) who takes care of the orphans as if they were his own and has trained Homer to take his place.  The one thing Homer could never get used to were the illegal abortions, safe as they were, that Wilber insisted on performing.  It's through one of these abortions that Homer meets Candy (Theron) and Wally (Rudd).  He decides to leave the orphanage with them and take work in an apple orchard.  This of course troubles Larch for Homer is the closest thing he's ever had to a real family.This movie touches upon so many controversial subjects, from abortion (which is controversial no matter who you talk to) as well as incest and drug abuse, but it does so with taste and tact and an intelligence that makes this film that much more impressionable.  Upon the closing credits the viewer is given a lot to ponder, a lot to digest, but that's the tell tale sign that a movie of this caliber, a movie with a message, has done its job.  I personally think that `The Cider House Rules' is one of those movies that we all do well to experience for ourselves.",4,"Deep and somewhat unsettling, 'The Cider House Rules' delivers the goods.",1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,1706,"['Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'delivering', 'touching', 'thought', 'provoking', 'melodrama', 'only', 'elevated', 'prime', 'acting', 'part', 'entire', 'cast', 'Homer', 'Toby', 'Maguire', 'one', 'better', 'performances', 'still', 'feel', 'bit', 'nervous', 'uneasy', 'not', 'too', 'confident', 'own', 'acting', 'ability', 'though', 'offset', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'part', 'co-stars', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'who', 'embody', 'characters', 'come', 'seasoned', 'veterans', 'know', 'are.The', 'film', 'Homer', 'young', 'orphan', 'who', 'was', 'raised', 'Maine', 'orphanage', 'Dr.', 'Wilber', 'Larch', 'Caine', 'who', 'care', 'orphans', 'were', 'own', 'trained', 'Homer', 'take', 'place', 'one', 'thing', 'Homer', 'could', 'never', 'get', 'used', 'were', 'illegal', 'abortions', 'safe', 'were', 'Wilber', 'insisted', 'performing', 'one', 'abortions', 'Homer', 'Candy', 'Theron', 'Wally', 'Rudd', 'leave', 'orphanage', 'take', 'work', 'apple', 'orchard', 'course', 'troubles', 'Larch', 'Homer', 'closest', 'thing', 'ever', 'had', 'real', 'family.This', 'movie', 'touches', 'so', 'many', 'controversial', 'subjects', 'abortion', 'controversial', 'matter', 'who', 'talk', 'as', 'well', 'incest', 'drug', 'abuse', 'so', 'taste', 'tact', 'intelligence', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'impressionable', 'closing', 'viewer', 'given', 'lot', 'ponder', 'lot', 'digest', 'tell', 'tale', 'sign', 'movie', 'caliber', 'movie', 'message', 'done', 'job', 'personally', 'think', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'one', 'movies', 'do', 'well', 'experience']",The Cider House Rules VHS

Instead of trying to be cutting edge or over the top, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; succeeds in making a beautiful film and that alone. This film has a good story (the movie was adapted from John Irving's novel), modestly good acting, and a good score.&quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is a simple story with well-recognized themes. An orphan boy named Homer(played by Toby Maguire) helps a doctor(played by Michael Caine) to take care of orphan children and perform abortions. However-like all teenagers in movies and books-Homer has a desire to see life and decides to go away with a couple who have just visited to do just that, see life. Michael Caine's character insists that Homer stay but of course doesn't listen. Toby and Michael have an excellent chemistry on film. On his travels with the couple, Homer falls in love and discovers a mystery hidden by a group of African-American slaves on an orchard.The film is like learning French or listening to Handel; just beautiful all around. The Cinematography is brilliant and makes me want to go to Maine. The acting is well reserved and doesn't become mellow-dramatic or fake. The score(I bought it on CD after I saw the film) is also another great aspect of the film. From the dramatic theme to the simple piano numbers, the score adds to the greatness of the film.I recommend this film to everyone and know you'll enjoy it.

484028,A23DFB8IUTIZM0,6305949638,Dan Sherman,"[2, 3]","John Irving adapted his novel for the screen and kept many of the best parts. The film is set in rural Maine in the late 1930s. Much of the film centers of the orphanage run by the crusty Dr. Larch, wonderfully played by Michael Caine. He cares deeply for the orphans, especially for the grown-up Homer (Tobey Maguire) who has remained at the orphanage. The scenes in the orphanage are very touching, and the hurt that Larch feels when Tobey chooses to leave the orphanage is quite real. The movie also tells the tale of Tobey's life outside of the orphanage (and shows the doctor trying to get him back) as Tobey works on an apple farm. The characters are very well-drawn and very believable. Most of the film is quite engaging, though I found that it sometimes dragged when we moved from the Larch/Tobey relationship. In particular, there was a very rather extended and unsettling subplot of incest in a farmworker's family that really did not add much to the movie at all.By and large, this is a very good movie with great characters, real human interest, and and an excellent viusal look in terms of the period it covers. If you like the movie, the book builds on it very nicely, though the plot diverges in that it takes the story well beyond the time covered by the movie.",4,"Good Film, Many Touching Moments -- Caine is Great !",965952000,"08 11, 2000",2000,1278,"['John', 'Irving', 'adapted', 'novel', 'screen', 'kept', 'many', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'set', 'rural', 'Maine', 'late', '1930s', 'Much', 'film', 'centers', 'orphanage', 'run', 'crusty', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'deeply', 'orphans', 'especially', 'grown-up', 'Homer', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'who', 'remained', 'orphanage', 'scenes', 'orphanage', 'are', 'very', 'touching', 'hurt', 'Larch', 'feels', 'when', 'Tobey', 'leave', 'orphanage', 'quite', 'real', 'movie', 'also', 'tale', 'Tobey', 'life', 'orphanage', 'doctor', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'Tobey', 'apple', 'farm', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'well-drawn', 'very', 'believable', 'Most', 'film', 'quite', 'engaging', 'found', 'sometimes', 'dragged', 'when', 'moved', 'Larch/Tobey', 'relationship', 'particular', 'was', 'very', 'rather', 'extended', 'unsettling', 'subplot', 'incest', 'farmworker', 'family', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'add', 'much', 'movie', 'all.By', 'large', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'great', 'characters', 'real', 'human', 'interest', 'excellent', 'viusal', 'look', 'terms', 'period', 'like', 'movie', 'book', 'very', 'nicely', 'plot', 'diverges', 'story', 'well', 'time', 'covered', 'movie']",The Cider House Rules VHS

484031,A2VD3CYOEMJ6SR,6305949638,David E. Levine,"[1, 10]","The Cider House Rules is an adptation of a novel by John Irving. This movie takes place during the Second World War at an orphanage in Maine. The central characters are Homer played by Tobey Maguire, and the benevolent Dr. Larch, played by  Michael Caine. Homer is a young man who was raised in  the orphange and Dr. Larch is the full time house physician who takes Homer under his wing and makes him his assistant.While liking the movie, I am troubled by it. This movie may be a great example of the ""blue state/red state schism in this country. Dr. Larch performs abortions on demand for any woman who comes to him seeking one. There is no real treatment of this controversial subject until much later when an abortion is performed in a very different context (in what was once called a theraputic abortion). It is pretty much a given that he performs abortions on demand and, he comes across benevolently. There is no agonizing as to whether a woman who comes to an orphanage seeking an abortion should be counseled as to the possibility of her delivering her baby and keeping the baby at the orphanage. It seems, that to Hollywood, this is not even an issue. No wonder so many people distrust the so called ""Hollywood elite"" and its values.There are, however, other dimensions to this movie. A soldier and his girlfriend come to the orpanage for an abortion and Homer leaves with them to work as an apple picker at an orchard. Homer discovers love, life in the real world and, basically his horizons are expanded. Meanwhile, Dr. Larch wants Homer to come back since he has hopes that Homer will be his successor. There are so many relationships that are explored in this movie that it is a pity that the abortion issue was treated so poorly.

I really like Tobey Maguire; I think he is a very good actor and his character, Homer Wells, is a very likeable young man that we want to see succeed in life as more than an apple picker, which makes the ending very satisfying for me in some regards.  The best part of the movie is definitely the beginning, which takes place in the orphanage, but I do think that it was really important for Homer to leave the orphanage and experience more of life.  The ending of the movie is bittersweet and kind of unrealistic, but this does not detract from the overall quality of this film.  Lasse Hallstrom is a wonderful director and I am a devoted fan of his movies.  Personally, I liked the movie because it raised some issues and made some arguments that pro-lifer's needed to hear.

484038,A1G56KHOUOFWDW,6305949638,"Dianne Foster ""Di""","[2, 5]","Toby McGuire is a fine young actor and absolutely superb teamed with the great Michale Caine. The supporting cast of the film is composed of many familiar faces, and each adult and child did a fine job.The story is set  in an orphanage in New England sometime early in the 20th Century.  Unlike  some &quot;film&quot; orphanages, this one is run by caring adults. One of  the strengths of the film is that it accurately portrays the real sorrow of  being an orphan, which sooner or later we all are, but which is  particularly hard on children. The staff at the orphanage compose an  extended family of sorts, but new children are coming, and old friends are  leaving, and there is little continuity or security. And, there is always  the hope that tommorrow some beautiful couple will choose you for their  child.Michael Caine, the loving doctor and surrogate father who heads  the orphanage staff is also a doctor who performs abortions. Every girl who  comes to the orphanage pregnant has the option of having the child or  having an abortion. This film has been described as &quot;pro-choice&quot;  and that's too simplistic. It doesn't advocate abortion as much as it  demonstrates that there are valid reasons why some women might need to  undergo this proceedure.

It soon becomes apparent that the central role is of his unofficially adopted son, Homer Wells, played by Tobey Maguire. This is perhaps the only serious criticism of the film- I would have liked to have seen more of Larch, but Homer goes off and spends time with other, less interesting characters. It may be because I like Michael Caine or because his performance was strong enough to win him an Oscar, or just because the eccentric character is so different from  anything Caine has played before. This is not to diminish Maguire's performance; he comes through very strongly and is not overshadowed by the veteran actor. He plays Homer very much like John Boy Walton, an educated innocent who has outgrown his place of birth and needs to go out into the world to get some real learning. This is highlighted by the fact that he has had much experience of women's bodies in an gynaecological sense, but no intimate encounters of his own. Homer goes to work on a cider farm, and the people he meets there have a huge influence on his life. There is an amusing performance from rapper Heavy D, which nicely balances Delroy Lindo's hard man character.

One of the babies in his care he tries to have adopted but after a couple of failed attempts he names the boy Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) and decides to keep him at the orphanage. The boy shows an interest in Larch's work and Larch uses him as his assistant when he grows up. Larch is primarily an obstetrician, but is also willing to perform abortions of unwanted babies. Homer assists Larch in this for several years but does not approve, so he leaves and joins a group of black migrant workers working in a cider factory. When he arrives, Wells takes it upon himself to establish a set of rules of conduct for the community. One of the women on whom Dr Larch performs an abortion is the lovely Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), who has become pregnant by Lt. Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd). When Homer meets Candy again with Worthington overseas, the two develop a relationship, but when Worthington sustains a crippling injury, Candy feels she must stay with him on his return home. The black community resent having rules imposed on them by Wells, but when one of the workers, Arthur Rose (Delroy Lindo), impregnates his own daughter who dies from complications of having an abortion, Rose realises the wisdom of imposing some rules for the community to live by.

Eventually, the rules are thrown in the fire, and the head apple picker says, ""The rules were written by people who don't live here; we live here...."" This is a metaphor for the movie.  All the rules about morality are inherited from others who don't live here on planet Earth in the good old USA now.Therefore, those rules don't apply. This is the kind of existentialism that traces back to Albert Camus' novel The Stranger where the characters are reacting to circumstances, even the main character who is eventually tried for murder. They are just people caught up in living their lives. Any attempt to judge them by rules or a moral standard is bogus.The thing about this movie if you just look at it uncritically and enjoy the beautiful scenery, the beautiful looking actors and actresses, and the personalities, all of whom seem superficially likeable and attractive, you might not notice that they have broken every rule in the book, every rule of morality or Judeo-Christian morality, whatever you want to call it.

484047,A9HKBYQB4XIEV,6305949638,"""eurotrashgirl""","[0, 0]","The Cider House Rules is a truly classic and beautiful film. The story-lines, acting, cinematography and scenery, the costumes, the wonderful performances by the children (most notably Erik Per Sullivan from TV's Malcom in the Middle), and the brilliant directing all make this film hearken back to the fantastic old-fashioned days of film-making. It is truly a feast for the eyes.The film brings to life an era of our history when the voices of women were still pale shadows of the thundering voices of Men and &quot;the Law.&quot; But/for a few men sensitive to the plight of women, (and to that of the children which so depend upon them), women's voices weren't heard. This film focuses on two men who hear those voices, and who quietly listen while the voices are allowed to grow stronger.This is Tobey Maguire's breakthrough role. He plays Homer Wells with quiet dignity and curiosity, and it's wonderful. Charlize Theron shines as Maguire's love interest, and Caine is perfect as Wilbur Larch. The role seems made for him, (as Homer Wells does for Maguire).Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom does here what he did so brilliantly in Something to Talk About, ie: makes nature, the seasons, the snows of winter, the falling leaves of autumn, the sweet ripe sun of summer, all characters in themselves. Swedes are renowned nature-lovers, so this makes sense. Anyone doubting me should see Under the Sun (Under Solen), by Colin Nutley.A classicly-acted and directed film, this film is one which I think will be looked back on in future years as one of the best films of the nineties. There are several complex and moving storylines, dealing with such issues as racism, abortion, adultery, incest, alcoholism/addiction, the power (both for good and for bad) of the Law, and, perhaps most importantly, the redemptive power of unconditional love.The film does not boldly draw lines of right and wrong. In fact, much of the film's beauty and power lies in the shades of grey between. The film reflects on a moral world outside of the law, a law of humanity and compassion, of what is right despite what dusty judges in their chambers have decreed. Cider House beautifully lulls us along on a profound journey about human beings just trying to be good people, and the sacrifices which are sometimes made, and not always acknowledged, for them to succeed in doing so.The Oscar-winning leads are fantastic, but the whole cast really shines here. Singer Erykah Badu's debut performance is excellent, and shows us that she has a successful future in acting waiting should she choose to quit her day job. Delroy Lindo's portrayal of an incestuous father is heart-breaking. And Paul Rudd gives a solid performance in a supporting role.This is a film which, once seen, will always be remembered.It reminds me of Titanic or Dead Poet's Society in that it just hits so many of the notes that movies are supposed to. The music, the acting, the scenery, the storylines. A timeless adaptation of a classic, humanist story.

John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of  the most complete stories I can remember in many years.  It is poignant,  exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human  emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so  broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or  director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment.  This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a  character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently  done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and  emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works.  Irving weaves a strong  moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being  human is not so easily codified.  He revisits this theme repeatedly, with  each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that  are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing  that stands out about this story, it is its human realism.  These are  ordinary people struggling with problems we all face.  We come to have  affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations.  Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds  us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or  hope.From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from  Lasse Hallstrom.  Known most in the U.S. for his direction of `What's  Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe  for almost twenty years.  However, this film will certainly go down as his  finest work.  In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to  Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a  feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully  filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period  props and costumes.  However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom,  working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a  way that no character seemed insignificant.  Hallstrom took great care to  do enough development of each character (often just visually without any  dialogue) that he made us care for each of them.  He gave the film an  emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours.  His  work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their  innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was  uniformly outstanding.  Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right  combination of idealism, naivet&eacute; and inner strength to make him an  unassuming but powerful lead.  Charlize Theron continues to impress me with  her acting ability.  Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness,  she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but  later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary  career spanning close to half a century.  He has long been one of my  favorite actors.  His performance here was powerful and well deserving of  the acclaim he received.  Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character;  egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly,  self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children.  Caine's  ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest  praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman.  Lindo's bright  smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength  and simple wisdom.  He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his  despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen  all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last  year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite.  It wasn't as  flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its  approach.  They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a  shame.  I rated it a 10/10.  In its quiet way, it captured my heart.",5,Poignant and powerful,966643200,"08 19, 2000",2000,4260,"['Nineteen', 'ninety-nine', 'was', 'outstanding', 'year', 'adaptations', 'major', 'literary', 'works', 'great', 'books', 'came', 'screen', 'last', 'year', 'favorite', 'John', 'Irving', 'novel', 'adaptation', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'stories', 'can', 'remember', 'many', 'years', 'poignant', 'exhilarating', 'astutely', 'human', 'scope', 'presenting', 'myriad', 'human', 'emotions', 'experiences.Often', 'when', 'story', 'attempts', 'cross', 'genres', 'so', 'broadly', 'lack', 'depth', 'insufficiency', 'writer', 'director', 'meet', 'variable', 'demands', 'such', 'wide-ranging', 'treatment', 'film', 'was', 'comedy', 'tragedy', 'romance', 'human-interest', 'story', 'character', 'study', 'period', 'piece', 'element', 'was', 'excellently', 'done.This', 'was', 'accomplished', 'sacrificing', 'philosophical', 'emotional', 'depth', 'Irving', 'imbues', 'works', 'Irving', 'strong', 'moral', 'story', 'rules', 'need', 'be', 'questioned', 'being', 'human', 'not', 'so', 'easily', 'codified', 'theme', 'repeatedly', 'character', 'facing', 'dilemmas', 'regarding', 'societal', 'personal', 'rules', 'are', 'difficult', 'reconcile', 'given', 'situations.If', 'one', 'thing', 'out', 'story', 'human', 'realism', 'are', 'ordinary', 'people', 'struggling', 'problems', 'face', 'come', 'have', 'affection', 'almost', 'can', 'identify', 'tribulations', 'story', 'excessively', 'sentimental', 'fatalistic', 'life', 'complicated', ""n't"", 'always', 'turn', 'out', 'way', 'plan', 'hope.From', 'filmmaking', 'perspective', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'asked', 'more', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'Known', 'most', 'U.S.', 'direction', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Hallstrom', 'been', 'making', 'wonderful', 'films', 'Europe', 'almost', 'twenty', 'years', 'However', 'film', 'will', 'certainly', 'go', 'down', 'finest', 'work', 'featurette', 'DVD', 'said', 'when', 'Blockbuster', 'daughter', 'shelf', 'will', 'have', 'feeling', 'pride', 'well', 'motion', 'picture', 'was', 'beautifully', 'filmed', 'rich', 'cinematography', 'breathtaking', 'locations', 'precise', 'period', 'props', 'costumes', 'However', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'Hallstrom', 'working', 'concert', 'Irving', 'was', 'orchestrate', 'large', 'cast', 'such', 'way', 'character', 'seemed', 'insignificant', 'Hallstrom', 'took', 'great', 'care', 'do', 'enough', 'development', 'character', 'often', 'just', 'visually', 'dialogue', 'made', 'care', 'gave', 'film', 'emotional', 'depth', 'breadth', 'difficult', 'achieve', 'two', 'hours', 'work', 'children', 'orphanage', 'was', 'superb', 'bringing', 'forth', 'innocence', 'enthusiasm', 'minimizing', 'plight.The', 'acting', 'was', 'uniformly', 'outstanding', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'infused', 'Homer', 'right', 'combination', 'idealism', 'naivet', 'eacute', 'inner', 'strength', 'make', 'unassuming', 'powerful', 'lead', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'impress', 'acting', 'ability', 'enchanting', 'girl-next-door', 'attractiveness', 'showed', 'terrific', 'range', 'character', 'first', 'seemed', 'shallow', 'later', 'proved', 'be', 'quite', 'complex.Michael', 'Caine', 'had', 'legendary', 'career', 'spanning', 'close', 'century', 'long', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'actors', 'performance', 'here', 'was', 'powerful', 'well', 'deserving', 'acclaim', 'received', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'was', 'extremely', 'complex', 'character', 'egotistical', 'self-abusive', 'manipulative', 'recalcitrant', 'yet', 'saintly', 'self-sacrificing', 'loving', 'crusader', 'good', 'children', 'Caine', 'ability', 'span', 'range', 'was', 'remarkable.Finally', 'have', 'highest', 'praise', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'orchard', 'foreman', 'Lindo', 'bright', 'smile', 'enthusiasm', 'created', 'rock', 'solid', 'character', 'charm', 'strength', 'simple', 'wisdom', 'admiration', 'immediately', 'despicable', 'act', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'pity', 'end.After', 'having', 'seen', 'films', 'were', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'best', 'picture', 'last', 'year', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'personal', 'favorite', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'flashy', 'rest', 'fact', 'was', 'downright', 'old', 'fashioned', 'approach', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'write', 'stories', 'anymore', 'shame', 'rated', '10/10', 'quiet', 'way', 'captured', 'heart']",The Cider House Rules VHS

That is certain the case with The Cider House Rules. John Irving's novel had much more character development, naturally (as a book can always reveal the interior lives of characters much more fully than can any theatrical treatment), but I was a bit disappointed that significant plot developments (such as Homer's relationships away from St. Clouds) were left out. So, in this case, do read the book-you'll be glad you did.That disclaimer having been made, I thought that the movie was very good. Michael Caine gave his usual wonderful performance, but I was never quite clear what accent he was trying to effect (being someone with a muddled accent myself, I am not really one to criticise on this point). The stories of the orphans of St. Clouds and the women who came for help in one way or another were very poignant. I was moved at the interplay between compassion and concern-the right to life/abortion debate (perhaps the central ideological pivot point in the novel and the movie) is presented in an interesting way, with just a small tendency to get preachy on one side or the other. To a large extent, this is never really resolved; while Homer in the end realises that in the adult world there are rarely black-and-white issues, but rather shades of gray, one does not know in the movie if he is really persuaded to his mentor's view.The Cider House Rules (referring firstly to the notice tacked to the wall of one of the lodgings) serves as a metaphor for the entire film. Who made these rules? What do they really mean? What purpose do they serve? Can't we make our own rules? I found this metaphor personally meaningful, for, as a theology student, these are questions I ask and am asked on a routine basis. What authority do rules written by others have on me? on society?This story is also one of vocation, of finding one's life's calling, a pursuit near to my heart as I prepare to enter the ministry. I find that my resistance to being pigeon-holed is similar to Homer's. He resisted the automatic assumption that he was a doctor, only to find in the course of his life that he was in fact called to be a doctor. Often when one tries to run away from a vocation, one runs into its arms in any case.The different family situations (Rose and her father, the flyer and his, the orphanage) shows that family and community exist on many different levels. The interactions and easy acceptance of these situations is perhaps a bit of a stretch, but the interplay shows that the traditional nuclear family was more of an ideal than a realisation.I loved the scenery, and the cinematography was very well done, but I have a slight irritation at the depiction of New England as being covered in fall-coloured foliage all year round. New Hampshire is one of my favourite holiday spots, and many is the time that I've been there that, lovely as it is, there was not a red-coloured or gold-coloured tree to be seen.This story essentially is one about love for the unloved, the overall love for humanity, of one making one's way in a confusing world, and trying to protect the vulnerable while allowing them freedom to grow, and an infusing of a sense of worth in those whom the world would otherwise consider worthless, as exemplified in the good doctor's nightly bidding: `Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England.'P.S.

484051,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,6305949638,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 6]","Conservatives, Fundamentalist Christians, and Pro-Lifers will automatically dislike THE CIDER HOUSE RULES on principle. Although such individuals may couch their criticism in terms of script, actors, and production values, the cause for their dislike is the film's highly existentualistic tone re personal values, its pro-choice stance re abortion, and the fairly compelling argument it makes in favor of that position. Set during World War II, CIDER HOUSE is the story of a child named Homer(Tobey Maguire) raised in a Maine orphanage by stubborn but likeable Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who trains Homer in medical arts. As Homer comes of age, however, he becomes increasingly unhappy with Dr. Larch's tight grip and extremely displeased with the fact that Dr. Larch also casually provides safe but highly illegal abortions to women who demand them. Consequently, Toby sets off to see the world--and finds himself working in an apple orchard, where he lives in ""the cider house"" with black seasonal farm workers.There is a great deal to recommend this film. Although Tobey Maguire sometimes overplays the innocence of the character, his performance of the unworldly Homer is generally effective; the real stars of the film, however, are Michael Caine, who brings remarkable humanity to the difficult role of Dr. Larch, and Charlize Hallstrom, with whom Homer falls in love. The supporting cast--which includes Delroy Lindo, Jane Alexander, Kathy Baker, and Erykah Badu--is quite fine. The cinematography is remarkably beautiful, and although not necessarily memorable in terms of dialogue the script is quite effective.Still, the film tends to rely more upon mood than upon actual substance, and as such becomes increasingly predictable as the action progresses, and most viewers will know how the story will end by the time they reach the film's midway point; it also has a very leisurely feel that some viewers will read as slow. Although it forms the crux of the conflict between Homer and Dr. Larch, the issue of abortion is never really fully explored and is presented in a rather one-sided (although very effective) manner. Those expecting an intense, fast-paced drama will be disappointed, and as previously noted pro-life viewers will despise the film from the word go; even so, and in spite of its occasional failings, most viewers will find it thought-provoking, extremely touching, and quite memorable.",4,Superior Soaper,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",2002,2414,"['Conservatives', 'Fundamentalist', 'Christians', 'Pro-Lifers', 'will', 'automatically', 'dislike', 'THE', 'CIDER', 'HOUSE', 'RULES', 'principle', 'such', 'individuals', 'may', 'couch', 'criticism', 'terms', 'script', 'actors', 'production', 'values', 'cause', 'dislike', 'film', 'highly', 'existentualistic', 'tone', 're', 'personal', 'values', 'pro-choice', 'stance', 're', 'abortion', 'fairly', 'compelling', 'argument', 'favor', 'position', 'Set', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'CIDER', 'HOUSE', 'story', 'child', 'named', 'Homer', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'raised', 'Maine', 'orphanage', 'stubborn', 'likeable', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'Homer', 'medical', 'arts', 'Homer', 'age', 'however', 'increasingly', 'unhappy', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'tight', 'grip', 'extremely', 'displeased', 'fact', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'also', 'casually', 'safe', 'highly', 'illegal', 'abortions', 'women', 'who', 'demand', 'Consequently', 'Toby', 'see', 'world', 'working', 'apple', 'orchard', 'where', 'cider', 'house', 'black', 'seasonal', 'farm', 'great', 'deal', 'recommend', 'film', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'sometimes', 'innocence', 'character', 'performance', 'unworldly', 'Homer', 'generally', 'effective', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'however', 'are', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'remarkable', 'humanity', 'difficult', 'role', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Charlize', 'Hallstrom', 'whom', 'Homer', 'love', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Erykah', 'Badu', 'quite', 'fine', 'cinematography', 'remarkably', 'beautiful', 'not', 'necessarily', 'memorable', 'terms', 'dialogue', 'script', 'quite', 'effective.Still', 'film', 'rely', 'more', 'mood', 'actual', 'substance', 'such', 'becomes', 'increasingly', 'predictable', 'action', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'know', 'how', 'story', 'will', 'end', 'time', 'reach', 'film', 'midway', 'point', 'also', 'very', 'leisurely', 'feel', 'viewers', 'will', 'read', 'slow', 'crux', 'conflict', 'Homer', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'issue', 'abortion', 'never', 'really', 'fully', 'explored', 'presented', 'rather', 'one-sided', 'very', 'effective', 'manner', 'expecting', 'intense', 'fast-paced', 'drama', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'previously', 'noted', 'pro-life', 'viewers', 'will', 'despise', 'film', 'word', 'go', 'even', 'so', 'spite', 'occasional', 'failings', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'thought-provoking', 'extremely', 'touching', 'quite', 'memorable']",The Cider House Rules VHS

Also, Delroy Lindo stands out quite notably as the lead migrant worker on the farm Homer goes to live.  its interesting how Lindo's character both loves his daughter as a father and as a lover.

Tobey Maguire stars as Homer Wells, the central  character, who has been reared in an orphanage in rural Maine from infancy  by a caring doctor named Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine in his superb  Oscar-winning performance). For years, Homer has watched and studied the  practices of Dr. Larch on pregnant women who either wanted an abortion or  refused their babies. When he sees a chance to leave and explore the world  on his own, he takes it and begins a self-quest for his true place in the  world. Where he finds it is in the last place one would think, but it makes  perfect sense once he discovers the true nature behind it. This touching  film made me cry in the theater and it's  a shame that not more people were  willing to see this picture. It only stayed in theaters for about two weeks  at a time. The children will steal your hearts and it is the loving  performance from Caine that drives the film to its tearful and redeeming  finale. Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander are well-cast as the nurses at the  orphanage who stand by Dr. Larch no matter how hard things can get for him  and his illegal practices. The film does not promote or demote the act of  abortion but rather treats it as just a part of the story...and as a fact  of life, that it is a woman's choice. Rachel Portman's beautiful and  touching music score will move you to tears. Even though it was nominated  for an Oscar, it still should have won. The heart of a film can be in its  music and that applies here in every way possible. Caine received a  standing ovation at the Oscar show when he won for Best Supporting Actor  and spent over half his speech time acknowledging the work of his fellow  nominees. John Irving also won for his screenplay adaptation of his own  novel, the first time a novelist had ever won for adapting his own work for  the silver screen since &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; won for 1990.  Outstanding on every level, this film is the pinnacle of the moviemaking  industry for the 20th century, as if to offer hope on life and love and the  lessons we need for the future, which would start with the 21st century.  Don't pass up on this film. It is one of the greatest achievements from  Hollywood in recent years.",5,The most poignant film of 1999,967075200,"08 24, 2000",2000,2620,"['1985', 'John', 'Irving', 'penned', 'American', 'classic', 'young', 'man', 'quest', 'belonging', 'world', 'besieged', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'self-doubt', 'first', 'script', 'adaptations', 'novel', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'nine-hour', 'movie', 'being', 'daring', 'writer', 'Irving', 'trimmed', 'down', 'two', 'hours', 'human', 'heart', 'true', 'nature', 'result', 'was', 'one', '1999', 'biggest', 'hits', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'central', 'character', 'who', 'been', 'reared', 'orphanage', 'rural', 'Maine', 'infancy', 'caring', 'doctor', 'named', 'Wilbur', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'superb', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'years', 'Homer', 'watched', 'studied', 'practices', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'pregnant', 'women', 'who', 'either', 'wanted', 'abortion', 'refused', 'babies', 'When', 'chance', 'leave', 'explore', 'world', 'own', 'self-quest', 'true', 'place', 'world', 'Where', 'last', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'perfect', 'sense', 'once', 'true', 'nature', 'touching', 'film', 'made', 'cry', 'theater', 'shame', 'not', 'more', 'people', 'were', 'willing', 'see', 'picture', 'only', 'stayed', 'theaters', 'about', 'two', 'weeks', 'time', 'children', 'will', 'steal', 'hearts', 'loving', 'performance', 'Caine', 'film', 'tearful', 'redeeming', 'finale', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'are', 'well-cast', 'nurses', 'orphanage', 'who', 'stand', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'things', 'can', 'get', 'illegal', 'practices', 'film', 'not', 'promote', 'demote', 'act', 'abortion', 'rather', 'just', 'part', 'story', 'fact', 'life', 'woman', 'choice', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'music', 'score', 'will', 'move', 'tears', 'Even', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'still', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'heart', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'music', 'applies', 'here', 'way', 'possible', 'Caine', 'received', 'standing', 'ovation', 'Oscar', 'show', 'when', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'spent', 'speech', 'time', 'acknowledging', 'work', 'fellow', 'nominees', 'John', 'Irving', 'also', 'won', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'own', 'novel', 'first', 'time', 'novelist', 'had', 'ever', 'won', 'adapting', 'own', 'work', 'silver', 'screen', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'won', '1990', 'Outstanding', 'level', 'film', 'pinnacle', 'moviemaking', 'industry', '20th', 'century', 'offer', 'hope', 'life', 'love', 'lessons', 'need', 'future', 'would', 'start', '21st', 'century', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pass', 'up', 'film', 'one', 'greatest', 'achievements', 'Hollywood', 'recent', 'years']",The Cider House Rules VHS

Combined with the  amazing writing talent of John Irving and outstanding actors such as Toby  McGuire and Michael Caine makes this movie memorable and strong!The  movie, set in a time period where many children were orphaned by the  various changes the era had to offer focuses on a small orphanage in St.  Cloud's, Maine, where abortions are not uncommon, the children grow up, and  learn the feeling of dissapointment, when a little girl with blond hair and  blue eyes is chosen by a family before a little boy with a runny nose and  charming smile, and so the competition continues with only small glimmers  of hope for each child, and some, like Fuzzy Stone, a small boy with lung  problems, never gets to have the family of his dreams. When the lead boy,  Homer (McGuire) leaves to find a new future by the ocean and earning a  living working at a small orchard with Migrant workers, he learns about  life, the kind of love he never knew he had experienced, and where he truly  belongs.This story, although it is pretty far off from the book, is a  masterpiece all of it's own.

The main plot line centers around a young man (Maguire), raised in an orphanage headed by a charismatic doctor (Caine), who decides to venture out into the world and learns the hard way that life is not merely black and white, but many subtle variations of gray.  While this is hardly a unique theme, the characters in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; are so exquisitely drawn, and the movie so masterfully produced, that everything which might in lesser hands seem overly familiar appears fresh, new, and distinctive.The DVD offers a perfect sound and video transfer, and includes a nice selection of &quot;extras&quot;, including a documentary on the making of the film, the original Theatrical Trailer, and highlights of the television ad campaign.

It gave us cute orphans, and an ether-addicted benevolent doctor, and names and settings (and readings) that evoked Dickens. Perhaps those evocations made more sense in the book - they didn't seem to fit in the movie.There were wonderful moments, to be sure. ""Goodnight you princes of Maine, you kings of New England."" The cinematography was gorgeous, the banter between the apple pickers realistic, but the core of the matter - these themes - on the core the movie was conspicuously silent. Not silent in that it had nothing to say, but silent in that we've heard it all before. We weren't given any new ways to look at the abortion struggle, or the disgust of incest. Even on responsibility the film was, while not silent, disingenuous.Also, nothing at all happened in the film that surprised me. I knew what was going to happen before it happened, and when events occurred that I hadn't anticipated, they were cloyingly organic and therefore neither surprising nor terribly moving.Tobey McGuire, for all the money he's making now as Spider-Man, can't move his upper lip when he speaks, and so his delivery is always utterly devoid of emotion and his characters lack believability. Michael Caine and Kathy Bates were wonderful, both are extremely good actors. Perhaps the most believable, and sympathetic character, was Theron's - and the best acted. She bore one of the themes: responsibility. She has my vote for best actor in this picture.

Never adopted, he becomes the favourite of orphanage director Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), who imparts his full medical knowledge on Homer, who becomes a skilled, albeit unlicensed, physician. But Homer yearns for a self-chosen life outside the orphanage. When Wally (Paul Rudd) and pregnant Candy (Charlize Theron) visit the orphanage Dr. Larch provides medically safe, albeit illegal, abortions Homer leaves with them to work on Wally's family apple farm. Wally goes off to war, leaving Homer and Candy alone together. What will Homer learn about life and love in the cider house? What of the destiny that Dr. Larch has planned for him?I found The Cider House Rules to be marvellous the first time round, I would of given it perhaps a 92/100 rather than the 78/100 score I have just recently lowered it to. I found a lot of flaws in the film, it's sometimes boring and a little corny at times, but it remains a dramatically moving piece of work with excellent direction from the Oscar-nominated Hallstrom. Tobey Maguire and Charlize Theron are superbly cast as the two movie-lover's dripping closer and closer, while Michael Caine, if not quite as good as fellow Oscar nominee's, still put in a hearty and believable performance as the caring Dr. Larch. Another big bonus is the piano score, which is brilliantly played by Rachel Portman and friends, and is an exceptional score, which suits the movie perfectly.Highly recommended and nicely setout, The Cider House Rules is a critically acclaimed piece of work that truly deserves its praise.",4,Nicely done and highly recommended,985392000,"03 24, 2001",2001,2057,"['Cider', 'House', 'RulesScore', '78/100After', 'winning', 'two', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'been', 'nominated', '5', 'more', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'became', 'one', 'many', 'must-see', 'personally', 'think', 'did', ""n't"", 'deserve', 'such', 'Academy', 'praise', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'pretty', 'much', 'great', 'film', 'can', 'think', 'lot', 'better', 'movies', 'came', 'out', 'year', 'nonetheless', 'watchable', 'nicely', 'played-out', 'little', 'flick', 'Swedish', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom.Homer', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'orphan', 'remote', 'St', 'Cloud', 'Maine', 'Never', 'adopted', 'favourite', 'orphanage', 'director', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'who', 'full', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'Homer', 'who', 'skilled', 'unlicensed', 'physician', 'Homer', 'yearns', 'self-chosen', 'life', 'orphanage', 'When', 'Wally', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'pregnant', 'Candy', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'visit', 'orphanage', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'medically', 'safe', 'albeit', 'illegal', 'abortions', 'Homer', 'leaves', 'work', 'Wally', 'family', 'apple', 'farm', 'Wally', 'war', 'leaving', 'Homer', 'Candy', 'alone', 'together', 'What', 'will', 'Homer', 'learn', 'life', 'love', 'cider', 'house', 'What', 'destiny', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'planned', 'found', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'be', 'marvellous', 'first', 'time', 'round', 'would', 'given', 'perhaps', '92/100', 'rather', '78/100', 'score', 'have', 'just', 'recently', 'lowered', 'found', 'lot', 'flaws', 'film', 'sometimes', 'boring', 'little', 'corny', 'times', 'dramatically', 'moving', 'piece', 'work', 'excellent', 'direction', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Hallstrom', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'are', 'superbly', 'cast', 'two', 'movie-lover', 'dripping', 'closer', 'closer', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'fellow', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'still', 'put', 'hearty', 'believable', 'performance', 'caring', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'big', 'bonus', 'piano', 'score', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'friends', 'exceptional', 'score', 'suits', 'movie', 'perfectly.Highly', 'recommended', 'nicely', 'setout', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'piece', 'work', 'praise']",The Cider House Rules VHS

Wally Worthington, Charlize Theron as Candy Kendall, Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, and Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch (Academy Award Winning Roll).  While Rotten Tomatoes grants &#8220;The Cider House Rules&#8221; a 71%, critics gave some pretty polarized reviews expressing both praise and distaste for the film.  Confusing opinions aside, this is the movie responsible for that familiar line &#8220;Goodnight, you Princes of Maine, you Kings of New England,&#8230;&#8221; spoken by Michael Caine&#8217;s character.  I think the movie is extremely moving and well-done; the characters become very real.  I will say that this is not a movie for children, and it can be extremely sad at some parts.Perhaps, in part, due to John Irving&#8217;s direct involvement with the film-making process (he wrote the screenplay which won him an Academy Award) and work with director Lasse Hallstrom, there are remarkably few differences between the book and screen versions of the story.  That being said, like many &#8216;based-on-the-novel&#8217; films, several characters&#8217; personalities and/or motivations were revamped and characters featured in the book such as Angel and Melony did not make it into the movie.  These two characters had particularly large rolls in the novel, but Irving felt their involvement in the movie would create too many dynamics likely to detract from the lead story.The Story:  Dr. Wilbur Larch, the &#8220;headmaster&#8221; of an orphanage, plays a very fatherly roll to young Homer Wells, a twice-returned foster child.  Homer&#8217;s experiences with his foster families were devastating, but Dr. Larch gives Homer a sense of belonging at the orphanage.  Larch is many things, but among them he is a closet abortionist and ether addict who takes Homer under his wing to learn obstetrics and--begrudgingly to Homer--abortions.Wally Worthington of the Worthington family apply orchard and his girlfriend, Candy Kendall, come to Dr. Larch seeking an abortion, but leave taking Homer back to the orchard with them.  Homer begins to work as an apple harvester with a group of migrant workers led by Arthur Rose.  Because these migrant workers are seasonal, they are absent from the orchard for a time and upon their return, it is discovered that Arthur had raped his daughter Rose, and she is now pregnant.  Reluctantly, Homer agrees to help Rose by performing an abortion.  Rose eventually decides to run away, but not before stabbing Arthur; Arthur requests his death be labeled a suicide in an effort to reconcile with his daughter.Homer and Candy engage in a relationship while Wally is away flying in World War II.  Unknown to Homer at the time, Dr. Larch had fabricated credentials allowing Homer to practice obstetrics and also altered Homer&#8217;s medical records to save him from being drafted into the war.  Wally returns paralyzed, but regains his relationship with Candy.  Dr. Larch dies from a possibly accidently overdose of ether, causing Homer to return to the orphanage to take on the roll of &#8220;headmaster.&#8221;  Homer finally learns the nature of the gifts Dr. Larch passed to him, and steps into Larch&#8217;s shoes.",4,Moving Movie,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",2013,3308,"['1999', 'film', 'was', 'adapted', 'novel', '8220', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', '8221', 'John', 'Irving', 'Stars', 'cast', 'include', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Lt.', 'Wally', 'Worthington', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Candy', 'Kendall', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Dr.', 'Wilbur', 'Larch', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Winning', 'Roll', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'grants', '8220', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', '8221', '71', '%', 'critics', 'gave', 'pretty', 'polarized', 'reviews', 'expressing', 'praise', 'distaste', 'film', 'Confusing', 'opinions', 'aside', 'movie', 'responsible', 'familiar', 'line', '8220', 'Goodnight', 'Princes', 'Maine', 'Kings', 'New', 'England', '8230', '8221', 'spoken', 'Michael', 'Caine', '8217', 's', 'character', 'think', 'movie', 'extremely', 'moving', 'well-done', 'characters', 'become', 'very', 'real', 'will', 'say', 'not', 'movie', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'extremely', 'sad', 'parts.Perhaps', 'part', 'due', 'John', 'Irving', '8217', 'direct', 'involvement', 'film-making', 'process', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'work', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'are', 'remarkably', 'few', 'differences', 'book', 'screen', 'versions', 'story', 'being', 'said', 'many', '8216', 'based-on-the-novel', '8217', 'films', 'several', 'characters', '8217', 'personalities', 'and/or', 'motivations', 'were', 'revamped', 'characters', 'featured', 'book', 'such', 'Angel', 'Melony', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'two', 'characters', 'had', 'particularly', 'large', 'rolls', 'novel', 'Irving', 'felt', 'involvement', 'movie', 'would', 'create', 'too', 'many', 'dynamics', 'likely', 'detract', 'lead', 'story.The', 'Story', 'Dr.', 'Wilbur', 'Larch', '8220', 'headmaster', '8221', 'orphanage', 'very', 'fatherly', 'roll', 'young', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'twice-returned', 'foster', 'child', 'Homer', '8217', 's', 'experiences', 'foster', 'families', 'were', 'devastating', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Homer', 'sense', 'belonging', 'orphanage', 'Larch', 'many', 'things', 'closet', 'abortionist', 'ether', 'addict', 'who', 'Homer', 'wing', 'learn', 'obstetrics', 'begrudgingly', 'Homer', 'abortions.Wally', 'Worthington', 'Worthington', 'family', 'apply', 'orchard', 'girlfriend', 'Candy', 'Kendall', 'come', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'seeking', 'abortion', 'leave', 'taking', 'Homer', 'back', 'orchard', 'Homer', 'work', 'apple', 'harvester', 'group', 'migrant', 'workers', 'led', 'Arthur', 'Rose', 'migrant', 'workers', 'are', 'seasonal', 'are', 'absent', 'orchard', 'time', 'return', 'discovered', 'Arthur', 'had', 'raped', 'daughter', 'Rose', 'now', 'pregnant', 'Reluctantly', 'Homer', 'help', 'Rose', 'performing', 'abortion', 'Rose', 'eventually', 'run', 'away', 'not', 'stabbing', 'Arthur', 'Arthur', 'death', 'be', 'labeled', 'suicide', 'effort', 'reconcile', 'daughter.Homer', 'Candy', 'engage', 'relationship', 'Wally', 'away', 'flying', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Unknown', 'Homer', 'time', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'had', 'fabricated', 'credentials', 'allowing', 'Homer', 'practice', 'obstetrics', 'also', 'altered', 'Homer', '8217', 'medical', 'records', 'save', 'being', 'drafted', 'war', 'Wally', 'paralyzed', 'relationship', 'Candy', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'possibly', 'accidently', 'ether', 'causing', 'Homer', 'return', 'orphanage', 'take', 'roll', '8220', '8221', 'Homer', 'finally', 'nature', 'gifts', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'passed', 'steps', 'Larch', '8217', 's', 'shoes']",The Cider House Rules VHS

At least the last time I caught it, I got to see the entire thing.On the first level, you have Michael Caine's character that doesn't want any new doctors on staff at the orphanage.  Everyone on staff, including Tobey McGuire's character and the children know that Caine's character doesn't want anyone else finding out about his addiction to ether and his willingness to perform illegal abortions.  While new blood would bring some sort of financial backing for the orphanage, the head doctor had the above mentioned liberal flaws.Tobey McGuire's character realized that he had to learn how to do something else instead of assist the head doctor, just in case his stay at the orphanage was &quot;abruptly ended&quot;.  He had been adopted three times and returned three times.  Out in the real world, he discovered what his true calling was when he discovered that Rose was pregnant.  Sorry, you are going to have to watch the movie to find out who the father is.The one thing I didn't like was that in spite of these rules that governed his job as apple-picker, his place at the orphanage, and the rules of common decency, everyone seemed to know when to break the rules, even the people over McGuire.

484104,A129YBX5BVNW2,6305949638,"Mark Barry ""Mark Barry""","[1, 3]","*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY REISSUE ***Lasse Hallstrom's 1999 adaptation of John Irving's 1985 book (of the same name) is a rather lovely little film - that's genuinely been upgraded by BLU RAY. It's not note-perfect as a transfer by any means (soft focus here and there, a bit of grain and blocking too) - but when it's good (which is a lot of the time) - it's really gorgeous to look at.You notice the improvements especially when the story gets to the home and lands of Olive Worthington and her son Wally (great casting in Kate Nelligan and Paul Rudd). She's an estate-owning boss and he's a dashing young Airforce Pilot who is waiting for overseas action in the Second World War. Even the indoor scenes in the live-in hut where all the apple pickers live (the 'Cider House' mentioned in the title) are very clear and at times amazingly so. The faces and clothing of the actors are razor-sharp too (superb cast choices in Delroy Lindo, Erykah Badu, Evan Park, Heavy D, and K. Todd Freeman). So too when Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire's character) is out walking with Wally's beautiful and vivacious fianc&eacute; Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) while Wally's away at war - the shots by the Sea and the nearby lobster fishing port are beautiful to look at.Acting-wise - there is so much to savour here. A huge part of the film's heart has to go to touching performances from children - Erik Per Sullivan as the bronchial Fuzzy, Kieran Culkin as the troubled Buster and Paz De La Huerta as the young teenage girl who fancies Homer way too much for her own good. Throw in Kathy Baker and Jane Alexander as elderly nurses with an abundance of unconditional paternal heart - and it feels good the second it opens. The story then moves as Homer does away from the snowbound hills and rivers of Maine to the sunny fields of working orchards in South Carolina.But the movie belongs to its two principal leads - Michael Caine as Dr. Wilbur Larch and Tobey Maguire as the emotionally stilted orphan boy - Homer Wells (named after a cat and someone whose deep). First up is Caine who is simply sensational. Moving like a force of benevolent kindness amid the cold wooden rooms of ""St. Clouds"" (a 1930's and 1940's Orphanage he runs) - he is pragmatic and practical to the visiting pregnant women who don't need judgement (dialogue above) but an operation that is illegal. Describing himself as ""...a caretaker to many, father to none..."" - he mother hen's over a lively cast of young children abandoned in the big house with an almost casual cruelty. Each hurt child of course longs to be genuinely wanted - to be taken away by childless parents who occasionally come to visit and adopt. The scene where one pretty girl appeals to a couple - so they take her - but leave the rest behind - is heartbreaking. Caine imbibes so many of these difficult moments with a huge humanity - he's an actor capable of conveying extraordinary compassion and anger - sometimes one after the other. The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards and won 2 - one for Caine as Best Supporting Actor and the other for Best Adapted Screenplay by John Irving.Tobey Maguire excels too - his performance is full of quiet acceptance at first - but then moves into a longing for a more varied life outside of his mentor's 'doctoring' requirements. Homer's journey to his own 'purpose in the world' is long but convincing. Maguire is very, very good here. As is Charlize Theron - not just a beautiful woman - but a hugely accomplished actress. Watch out too for John Irving the Author in a tiny cameo as a Station Master at the beginning (doing his Hitchcock).The ""Making Of"" interviews all the principal actors - as well as John Irving on adapting his own book, Stephen King (the Author) on Irving's writing and Lasse Hallstrom the Director on shooting such a huge book. Its default aspect is 1.2:35 so it has bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretched to full screen - it still looks great.""The Cider House Rules"" is a warm film - and one I thoroughly enjoyed re-watching. But more importantly - if you're a fan and have love for this movie's combined cruelties and charms - then you need to see it/own it on BLU RAY.Highly recommended.ASPECT:1.2:35:1

484106,A152C8GYY25HAH,6305949638,Matthew Horner,"[4, 5]","The Cider House Rules is based on a novel by the fine American writer, John Irving. Over the years, it has proved difficult to translate his works into movies. The results have ranged from fair [The World According to Garp] to dismal [Hotel New Hampshire]. This time around, Mr. Irving chose to take a more active role in the process, and the results are splendid.The first part of the movie is set in an orphanage in rural Maine in the late 1940s. Homer Wells [Tobey Macguire] is a young man who has spent his entire life there and is its oldest orphan. Fortunately for him, he has been taken under the wing of kindly, eccentric Dr. Wilber Larch [Michael Caine] who has been in charge of the place for many years. He has worked so closely with Dr. Larch that he now knows as much about medicine as almost any doctor. Still, he is in an odd situation. Not only is he not really a doctor, he's never been to high school. He is all knowledge and no credentials. As far as Dr. Larch is concerned, Homer can stay there forever and eventually wind up running the orphanage. Homer, however, yearns to see the world. One afternoon a beautiful woman named Ashley [Charlize Theron] appears with her fiance. She is there to have an abortion. Dr. Larch has performed many of these, every one of them illegal, because he has come to believe that there are simply too many unwanted children in the world. This is the one subject that Homer is in total disagreement on with his mentor. After the operation, Homer leaves the orphanage with Ashley and her boyfriend. This begins the second story line, which in the end ties in with the first one.Michael Caine won Best Supporting Actor for his role. His is one of the most memorable characters in recent times, as well as one of the most poignant. His love of the children in his care is unconditional, while at the same time he is dismayed and saddened by a world that allows these innocents to be so callously cast aside. Tobey Macguire, as I have stated before, is one of our most gifted actors. It is always amazing to me to see such masterful and understated performances by one so young. As for the set design and photography, The Cider House Rules is about as good as it gets. Rachel Portman has contributed a brilliant and melancholy musical score.With the current abortion controversy raging like the Hatfield and McCoy feud, it is reassuring that Miramax Films had the courage to make this movie at all. The Cider House Rules treats the subject with great dignity and proves once more that, in any area, where there is a rule, there is an exception.",5,On my Top Ten List of 1999,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",2002,2593,"['Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'based', 'novel', 'fine', 'American', 'writer', 'John', 'Irving', 'years', 'proved', 'difficult', 'translate', 'works', 'movies', 'results', 'have', 'ranged', 'fair', 'World', 'According', 'Garp', ']', 'dismal', '[', 'Hotel', 'New', 'Hampshire', ']', 'time', 'around', 'Mr.', 'Irving', 'chose', 'take', 'more', 'active', 'role', 'process', 'results', 'are', 'splendid.The', 'first', 'part', 'movie', 'set', 'orphanage', 'rural', 'Maine', 'late', '1940s', 'Homer', 'Wells', '[', 'Tobey', 'Macguire', ']', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'entire', 'life', 'oldest', 'orphan', 'Fortunately', 'been', 'taken', 'wing', 'kindly', 'eccentric', 'Dr.', 'Wilber', 'Larch', '[', 'Michael', 'Caine', ']', 'who', 'been', 'charge', 'place', 'many', 'years', 'worked', 'so', 'closely', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'now', 'as', 'much', 'medicine', 'almost', 'doctor', 'Still', 'odd', 'situation', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'really', 'doctor', 'never', 'been', 'high', 'school', 'knowledge', 'credentials', 'As', 'far', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'concerned', 'Homer', 'can', 'stay', 'there', 'forever', 'eventually', 'wind', 'up', 'running', 'orphanage', 'Homer', 'however', 'yearns', 'see', 'world', 'One', 'afternoon', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'named', 'Ashley', '[', 'Charlize', 'Theron', ']', 'fiance', 'there', 'have', 'abortion', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'performed', 'many', 'one', 'illegal', 'come', 'believe', 'are', 'simply', 'too', 'many', 'unwanted', 'children', 'world', 'one', 'subject', 'Homer', 'total', 'disagreement', 'mentor', 'operation', 'Homer', 'orphanage', 'Ashley', 'boyfriend', 'second', 'story', 'line', 'end', 'ties', 'first', 'one.Michael', 'Caine', 'won', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'role', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'recent', 'times', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'most', 'poignant', 'love', 'children', 'care', 'unconditional', 'same', 'time', 'dismayed', 'saddened', 'world', 'innocents', 'be', 'so', 'callously', 'cast', 'aside', 'Tobey', 'Macguire', 'have', 'stated', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'actors', 'always', 'amazing', 'see', 'such', 'masterful', 'understated', 'performances', 'one', 'so', 'young', 'set', 'design', 'photography', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'as', 'good', 'Rachel', 'Portman', 'contributed', 'brilliant', 'melancholy', 'musical', 'score.With', 'current', 'abortion', 'controversy', 'raging', 'Hatfield', 'McCoy', 'feud', 'reassuring', 'Miramax', 'Films', 'had', 'courage', 'make', 'movie', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'subject', 'great', 'dignity', 'once', 'more', 'area', 'where', 'rule', 'exception']",The Cider House Rules VHS

After watching it this weekend, I am  now a fan.Michael Cain's performance is remarkable.  Toby McGuire is  very good too.  He achieves success in playing the role of Homer.  McGuire  is believable when playing scenes that require innocence (i.e. the only  movie he's ever seen is KING KONG; he's never been out of the state of  Maine).I've read Irving's book, but to be honest, don't have a  recollection of it.  Therefore, I watched the film version with open eyes  and cannot compare it to the novel.  However, Irving's writing job on the  screenplay is excellent.  And it was wonderful to see him win the Academy  Award for his efforts.The DVD is done quite well.  There is a  documentary on the making of the film.  It's a little long on scenes from  the film -- definitely watch it *after* you watch the movie to avoid  spoilers.  The cut scenes section is interesting.  Usually, once you view  the scenes that were cut by the director you agree that they were boring  and added nothing to the movie.  These scenes were curiously lost: for  instance, a scene where the apple-pickers are introduced at dinner; and a  scene where the pickers end up on the roof of the cider house -- a specific  cider house rule, not to be broken!I really enjoyed and was moved by  this film.",4,Good Story ...

I loved the movie, but it wasn't quite as good  as I'd hoped. Certainly not as engaging or sentimental as The World  According to Garp, which is still the best movie based on an Irving novel.  (Speaking of which, why the hell hasn't Garp been released on DVD? It's a  classic!) Anyway, I had a couple of Kleenex at the ready as I was expecting  a tearjerker; alas, I only had to use them once.The characters are  developed nicely and while the story is a bit saccharine, you can't help  but feel affectionate toward them.

484115,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,6305949638,Mr. Cairene,"[1, 4]","Read a few pages of John Irving's wonderful novel The Cider House Rules  and you may decide that novel is not worth reading. The reason why the book  as a whole was such a success is the familiarity the reader builds over 718  pages. The quirks of its many characters, the acute sense of time and  place, its many subplots and sly observations about human nature and  self-rightousness. This is precisely why Lasse Hallstrom's gently charming  film is essentially a failure, it is impossible to adapt such a sprawling  novel into the movie without either having an atrociously long running time  or making the whole thing into a fast paced incomprehensible mess. The  screenplay by Irving himself leaves out a lot of the book (most  distressingly the colorful, butch and gripping character of Melony), yet  still fails to be an adequate adaptation for the screen. The film feels  like what it really is, a large work of literature compressed and condensed  into a small number of scenes, themes are lost and charcaters  distilled.For those of you who haven't read the book, the film is  still annoyingly thin, never really discussing the issues it raises, all  the performances (with the exception of Michael Caine) hardly register. Yes  it looks gorgeous and the kids are cute(a little too cute), but does this  supposed coming of age tale amount to anything? Not really.Arguably  the most bizzare Oscar nomination of the nineties must be that of Best  Director for Lasse Hallstrom. There is a pretty thick line between being  subtle and doing absolutly nothing, and his direction here is straight  forward its virtually non-existant, which is partially responsible for the  film's unclear message. Considering that the academy ignored a pair of  spectacular directing jobs by David Russel for Three Kings and Daivid  Fincher for Fight Club this is unforgivable. Crazier still is John Irving's  oscar win for the script, as it is far from being cinematic, but  degenerates into an arbitrary series of events touching the bases but never  exploring similar events in the novel.To be honest, I've given much  better films (like Snow Falling on Cedars) the same 3 star I awarded this  one becuase I can't get myself to give it the dismissive 2 stars. Take my 3  stars as a weak reccomendation for a rental.

484116,A3UH3X6PZ7WCWG,6305949638,"Nicholas Rog ""Zombie Fearer""","[6, 9]","""The Cider House Rules"" stars Tobey Maguire as Homer Wells, an orphan who spends his young life growing up in an orphanage, while being mentored by Dr. Larch(Michael Caine) on gynocology.St. Cloud orphanage is the setting for the beggining of the film and while here, we learn that Dr. Larch is performing more than simple baby deliveries.  He is also performing abortions, which at this point in the United States, is illegal.  Dr. Larch performs these abortions, because as he says ""If I don't do them properly or turn these women away, somone else will perform the abortion improperly"" and we are shown the horrible results of a situation where that happens.Homer is very appreciative of everything that Dr. Larch has taught him, but feels that he must decide for himself what path his life will take.  He also has a serious issue with the idea of abortion.  So, Homer decides to leave with a young couple Candy(Charlize Therion) and Wally(Paul Rudd), whom just went through an abortion of their own.  Wally is a pilot for the air force, on a leave to help his mother with the harvesting of their apple orchards.  Homer decides that he would like to try his hand at apple-picking and gets a job at the orchards.While here, Homer stays with the rest of the apple-pickers; a group of southern, black men, very different from anyone that Homer has ever known in his sheltered life.  He takes to all of the men and finds that he really enjoys apple-picking.  Homer also falls deeply in love with Candy, while Wally is sent back to war.The boss of the apple-picking crew, Mr. Rose is a tough, mean boss, who prefers for his workers to ""mind their business"" and remember that their business is ""the apple business, nothing else.""  Well, the movie really gets interesting when we find out that Rose, Mr. Rose's daughter, is hiding a pregnancy.  Homer discovers this immediatly, seeing as to how he is a trained physician.  He tries to talk Rose into taking a trip to St. CLoud to have a proper abortion, but his pleas fall on deaf ears.Then we discover that the father of Rose's baby is none other than her father, Mr. Rose.  At this point, Homer must make and face a critical decision.  He knows that if he does not perform the abortion, Rose will attempt to handle it on her own.  He also knows that their is no way that Mr. Rose will be willing to let Rose leave to go to St. Cloud.  So, Homer goes against his earlier morals and decides to perform the abortion on his own.  After he does so, Dr. Larch overdoses on ether, a drug he has somewhat of an addiction to and Homer realizes that the real world is really no different than the illegal one he knew at St. Cloud, only at St. CLoud, he was actually making the world better for many people, whereas in the real world, nobody else cared enough to let him help, when he felt he was capable of helping.This is an extremly fascinating movie, complete with a great cast, great writing, a great score and wonderful setting. This movie tackles controversial issues such as abortion and incestial rape and shows very grapically the repercussions of both.The title is intriguing, because when Homer reads the Cider House rules to his fellow apple-pickers(none of them can read), they all laugh, because they either break those rules all of the time or have no intention of ever doing what is forbidden in the others; except of course, sitting on the roof.  Prior to Home reading that rule about no sitting on the roof; none fo the apple-pickers had ever done so.  Well, after he read that rule to them, we see them on the roof numerous times.  As Mr. Rose states ""Those ain't our rules.  They was written by folks that don't live here.  We live here.  We make our own rules.""  And that is basically the plot of this story.  Dr. LArch had been ""making his own rules"" everytime that he decided to perform an abortion or when he forged a Harvard diploma with Homer's name on it.  He was doing things his way and, in the end, the best way for everyone.  Homer ""made his own rules"" when he decides to hep Rose and perform an abortion for her.This movie is really excellent and thought-provoking and is really worth watching.  Very boring for children, so don't even bother showing to them.  No extreme violence or sex scenes and although numerous abortions are performed in this movie, nothing very graphic is shown---THANK GOD.A definate movie to check out!Great Job to the cast on this one!!",4,Rules are meant to be broken,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",2005,4433,"['Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'orphan', 'who', 'young', 'life', 'growing', 'up', 'orphanage', 'being', 'mentored', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'gynocology.St', 'Cloud', 'orphanage', 'setting', 'beggining', 'film', 'here', 'learn', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'performing', 'more', 'simple', 'baby', 'deliveries', 'also', 'performing', 'abortions', 'point', 'United', 'States', 'illegal', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'abortions', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'properly', 'turn', 'women', 'away', 'somone', 'else', 'will', 'perform', 'abortion', 'improperly', 'are', 'shown', 'horrible', 'results', 'situation', 'where', 'happens.Homer', 'very', 'appreciative', 'everything', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'taught', 'feels', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'path', 'life', 'will', 'take', 'also', 'serious', 'issue', 'idea', 'abortion', 'So', 'Homer', 'leave', 'young', 'couple', 'Candy', 'Charlize', 'Therion', 'Wally', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'whom', 'just', 'went', 'abortion', 'own', 'Wally', 'pilot', 'air', 'force', 'leave', 'help', 'mother', 'harvesting', 'apple', 'orchards', 'Homer', 'would', 'like', 'try', 'hand', 'apple-picking', 'job', 'orchards.While', 'here', 'Homer', 'rest', 'apple-pickers', 'group', 'southern', 'black', 'men', 'very', 'different', 'anyone', 'Homer', 'ever', 'known', 'sheltered', 'life', 'men', 'really', 'apple-picking', 'Homer', 'also', 'deeply', 'love', 'Candy', 'Wally', 'sent', 'back', 'war.The', 'boss', 'apple-picking', 'crew', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'tough', 'mean', 'boss', 'who', 'workers', 'mind', 'business', 'remember', 'business', 'apple', 'business', 'nothing', 'else', 'Well', 'movie', 'really', 'interesting', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'Rose', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'daughter', 'hiding', 'pregnancy', 'Homer', 'immediatly', 'seeing', 'how', 'trained', 'physician', 'talk', 'Rose', 'taking', 'trip', 'St', 'CLoud', 'have', 'proper', 'abortion', 'pleas', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ears.Then', 'discover', 'father', 'Rose', 'baby', 'none', 'other', 'father', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'point', 'Homer', 'must', 'make', 'face', 'critical', 'decision', 'not', 'perform', 'abortion', 'Rose', 'will', 'attempt', 'handle', 'own', 'also', 'way', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'will', 'be', 'willing', 'let', 'Rose', 'leave', 'go', 'St', 'Cloud', 'So', 'Homer', 'earlier', 'morals', 'decides', 'perform', 'abortion', 'own', 'so', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'ether', 'drug', 'somewhat', 'addiction', 'Homer', 'real', 'world', 'really', 'different', 'illegal', 'one', 'knew', 'St', 'Cloud', 'only', 'St', 'CLoud', 'was', 'actually', 'making', 'world', 'better', 'many', 'people', 'whereas', 'real', 'world', 'nobody', 'else', 'cared', 'enough', 'let', 'help', 'when', 'felt', 'was', 'capable', 'helping.This', 'extremly', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'complete', 'great', 'cast', 'great', 'writing', 'great', 'score', 'wonderful', 'setting', 'movie', 'controversial', 'issues', 'such', 'abortion', 'incestial', 'rape', 'very', 'grapically', 'repercussions', 'both.The', 'title', 'intriguing', 'when', 'Homer', 'Cider', 'House', 'rules', 'fellow', 'apple-pickers', 'none', 'can', 'read', 'laugh', 'break', 'rules', 'time', 'have', 'intention', 'ever', 'doing', 'what', 'forbidden', 'others', 'course', 'sitting', 'roof', 'Prior', 'Home', 'reading', 'rule', 'sitting', 'roof', 'none', 'fo', 'apple-pickers', 'had', 'ever', 'done', 'so', 'Well', 'read', 'rule', 'see', 'roof', 'numerous', 'times', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'ai', ""n't"", 'rules', 'was', 'written', 'folks', 'do', ""n't"", 'live', 'here', 'live', 'here', 'make', 'own', 'rules', 'basically', 'plot', 'story', 'Dr.', 'LArch', 'had', 'been', 'making', 'own', 'rules', 'everytime', 'decided', 'perform', 'abortion', 'when', 'forged', 'Harvard', 'diploma', 'Homer', 'name', 'was', 'doing', 'things', 'way', 'end', 'best', 'way', 'everyone', 'Homer', 'made', 'own', 'rules', 'when', 'hep', 'Rose', 'perform', 'abortion', 'her.This', 'movie', 'really', 'excellent', 'thought-provoking', 'really', 'worth', 'watching', 'Very', 'boring', 'children', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'showing', 'extreme', 'violence', 'sex', 'scenes', 'numerous', 'abortions', 'are', 'performed', 'movie', 'nothing', 'very', 'graphic', 'shown', '-THANK', 'GOD.A', 'definate', 'movie', 'check', 'out', 'Great', 'Job', 'cast', 'one']",The Cider House Rules VHS

The cinematography is exquisite and evocative. As Homer ultimately learns,  the validity of the Cider House Rules (and, by extension, all rules) is  subjective; but, by the time we reach this epiphany, it hardly seems  revelatory considering Homer was raised by an abortionist, and one who  taught him the trade, at that.

It is based on a novel by John Irving and adapted for the screen by the author.The story is mostly about life and death at an orphanage in Maine called St. Cloud's before and during World war II. In particular it is about a boy (Tobey Maguire) who is twice rejected by prospective parents and returned to the orphanage. He is then trained by the director (Michael Caine) of St. Cloud's to be his assistant as an obstetrician and gynocologist. With great sadness Maguire leaves St. Cloud's as a young man to  see the world and ends up on the Maine coast where he works on an apple farm with migrant workers.Because of the heavy subject matter the mood is often sombre and some of the incidents involving the orphans seem especially heartbreaking. Tobey Maguire is superb in the leading role as Homer Wells. Michael Caine is excellent as Dr. Wilbur Larch. The rest of the strong supporting cast includes Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Erykah Badu and Kate Nelligan.

Hitchcock (English), or Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m  (Swedish), the list could be very long, and although John Irving is a very  fine writer (as well as maybe one of the last true humanists) America is so  plagued with &quot;Politikally Korekt&quot; that it is almost impossible to  express anything which doesn't comply with.

And, just a short message for Jeff Shannon: I  don't think ther was so much vagueness about the issues, but it is just the  right level, so to not antagonize the P.K., and to help people understand  that the real 'human rights' lie with the 'real' human needs and not with  the 'Rules' they would like to impose upon the victims of events they were  unable to control.

I have never read John Ivring's novel, but I can tell that if the film is this good, the book must be good, too.THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is about a young man, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire, in his best performance yet), who lives and works as Dr. Wilbur Larch's (Michael Caine) assistant at a hospital-like orphanage where they deliver pregnanent womens' babies. Dr. Larch thinks of Homer as his son, even though they are not biologically a family.

At the end, Homer learns where he really belongs.THE CIDER HOUSE RULES is a mix of romance, comedy, tragedy, and drama. It's a beautiful and inspiring story.

And so it was with a young man who grew up an orphan in the State of Maine, in the years preceding World War II, in ""The Cider House Rules,"" directed by Lasse Hallstrom.  Under the tutelage and watchful eye of Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), the administrator of the orphanage in which Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) had lived his whole life, Homer, by 1943, had become quite knowledgeable and adept in the field of medicine.  What he lacked, however, was the formal education that would have enabled him to practice what he had learned, if indeed, he had so desired; which in fact he had not.  The orphanage was a world unto itself, a loving haven for unwanted children, but a place apart; and a larger world loomed just beyond it's perimeter, a world Homer Wells wanted to see.  And when circumstances present Homer with an opportunity to get away, he grabs it, and embarks upon his journey of discovery, much to the consternation of the good Dr. Larch, who fears that he has lost Homer-- whom he loves as a son-- to the world forever.  And forever is a long, long time.  Hallstrom presents the story with acuity and care, drawing upon the innate humanity of the characters--especially Dr. Larch and Homer-- to bring it all to life.  While Dr. Larch epitomizes the benevolent nature of man, one who has known the world and has come into his own, has found the place from which he can do some good, Homer represents the longings of youth; no longer a boy, but a man who must discover on his own what Dr. Larch already knows.  And, as it is in real life, it becomes a matter of experience; and though fate ultimately intervenes with a nudge in the right direction, it is Homer who decides the direction his own life will take-- it is he who finally realizes what is meant to be.  And under Hallstrom's steady and skillful hand, the journey becomes, not only Homer's, but the viewer's as well, as he mines the emotional depths of the characters, making them people with whom the audience will be readily able to identify.  Affecting an American accent for the first time in his career, Michael Caine gives a performance that deservedly earned him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.  He brings Dr. Larch so vividly to life, capturing the deep concern and humanity of the man, while conveying his sincerity and exposing his vulnerability; it's a complete and real portrayal, enriched with nuance and altogether memorable.  As good as Caine is, however, the film clearly belongs to Maguire, who gives a masterfully understated performance as Homer.  There is such expression in the pacific nature he lends to the character, along with a sense of mature acceptance that serve to accentuate his inner yearnings, that make Homer so believable, a person with whom it is easy to sympathize and relate.  There is something of a wistful poet beneath his stoic, though gentle, outward appearance that makes him endearing.  With a subtle ability, Maguire makes it clear that Homer is a person of intrinsic good, and it gives not only the character, but the performance, a ring of truth and integrity.  It's exceptional work, and taken in conjunction with his turns in ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Wonder Boys,"" firmly establishes Maguire as one of the best young actors in the business today.  The extraordinary supporting cast includes Delroy Lindo (Mr. Rose), Charlize Theron (Candy), Paul Rudd (Wally), Jane Alexander (Nurse Edna), Kathy Baker (Nurse Angela), Kieran Culkin (Buster), Kate Nelligan (Olive Worthington), K. Todd Freeman (Muddy), Erykah Badu (Rose Rose) and Erik Per Sullivan (Fuzzy).  Highlighted by outstanding performances and the sensitive interpretation and delivery of the story by Hallstrom, ""The Cider House Rules"" is a touching excursion into the depths of human emotions, and a taste of what life is all about.  More than just a film, it's an experience; one that will create a lasting impression on your soul, and one that absolutely must not be missed.",5,Outstanding Performances By Caine And Maguire,982627200,"02 20, 2001",2001,4151,"['boundaries', 'lives', 'sometimes', 'seem', 'self-ordained', 'other', 'times', 'seem', 'predetermined', 'higher', 'power', 'life', 'often', 'quest', 'ascertain', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'orphan', 'State', 'Maine', 'years', 'preceding', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'directed', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'tutelage', 'watchful', 'eye', 'Dr.', 'Wilbur', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'administrator', 'orphanage', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'had', 'lived', 'whole', 'life', 'Homer', '1943', 'had', 'become', 'quite', 'knowledgeable', 'adept', 'field', 'medicine', 'What', 'lacked', 'however', 'was', 'formal', 'education', 'would', 'have', 'enabled', 'practice', 'what', 'had', 'learned', 'indeed', 'had', 'so', 'desired', 'fact', 'had', 'not', 'orphanage', 'was', 'world', 'unto', 'loving', 'haven', 'unwanted', 'children', 'place', 'apart', 'larger', 'world', 'loomed', 'just', 'perimeter', 'world', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'wanted', 'see', 'when', 'circumstances', 'present', 'Homer', 'opportunity', 'get', 'away', 'grabs', 'journey', 'discovery', 'much', 'consternation', 'good', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'who', 'lost', 'Homer', 'whom', 'son', 'world', 'forever', 'forever', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'story', 'acuity', 'care', 'drawing', 'innate', 'humanity', 'characters', 'especially', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Homer', 'bring', 'life', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'benevolent', 'nature', 'man', 'one', 'who', 'known', 'world', 'come', 'own', 'found', 'place', 'can', 'do', 'good', 'Homer', 'longings', 'youth', 'no', 'longer', 'boy', 'man', 'who', 'must', 'discover', 'own', 'what', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'already', 'real', 'life', 'matter', 'experience', 'fate', 'ultimately', 'nudge', 'right', 'direction', 'Homer', 'who', 'direction', 'own', 'life', 'will', 'take', 'who', 'finally', 'what', 'meant', 'be', 'Hallstrom', 'steady', 'skillful', 'hand', 'journey', 'not', 'only', 'Homer', 'viewer', 'as', 'well', 'emotional', 'depths', 'characters', 'making', 'people', 'whom', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'readily', 'able', 'identify', 'Affecting', 'American', 'accent', 'first', 'time', 'career', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'so', 'vividly', 'life', 'capturing', 'deep', 'concern', 'humanity', 'man', 'conveying', 'sincerity', 'exposing', 'vulnerability', 'complete', 'real', 'portrayal', 'enriched', 'nuance', 'altogether', 'memorable', 'As', 'good', 'Caine', 'however', 'film', 'clearly', 'Maguire', 'who', 'masterfully', 'understated', 'performance', 'Homer', 'such', 'expression', 'pacific', 'nature', 'character', 'sense', 'mature', 'acceptance', 'serve', 'accentuate', 'inner', 'yearnings', 'make', 'Homer', 'believable', 'person', 'whom', 'easy', 'sympathize', 'relate', 'something', 'wistful', 'poet', 'stoic', 'though', 'gentle', 'outward', 'appearance', 'endearing', 'subtle', 'ability', 'Maguire', 'clear', 'Homer', 'person', 'intrinsic', 'good', 'not', 'only', 'character', 'performance', 'ring', 'truth', 'integrity', 'exceptional', 'work', 'taken', 'conjunction', 'turns', 'Ice', 'Storm', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'firmly', 'Maguire', 'one', 'best', 'young', 'actors', 'business', 'today', 'extraordinary', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'Mr.', 'Rose', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Candy', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Wally', 'Jane', 'Alexander', 'Nurse', 'Edna', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Nurse', 'Angela', 'Kieran', 'Culkin', 'Buster', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'Olive', 'Worthington', 'K.', 'Todd', 'Freeman', 'Muddy', 'Erykah', 'Badu', 'Rose', 'Rose', 'Erik', 'Per', 'Sullivan', 'Fuzzy', 'Highlighted', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'sensitive', 'interpretation', 'delivery', 'story', 'Hallstrom', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'touching', 'excursion', 'depths', 'human', 'emotions', 'taste', 'what', 'life', 'More', 'just', 'film', 'experience', 'one', 'will', 'create', 'lasting', 'impression', 'soul', 'one', 'absolutely', 'must', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",The Cider House Rules VHS

I checked out Cider House Rules because Michael Caine was in it. Michael Caine gives a great performance and the step-back-from-the-action style of acting of Toby McGuire was appropriate for this film.On the surface the film seems to be about abortion but in actuallity it is about choices. Michael Caine is the doctor at an orphanage and performs abortions for young ladies in distress. Toby McGuire is an orphan and the doctor's student. A student who does not agree with the teacher's choice to do these abortions. Of course, he will come to a turning point later when he must make a decision that he does not want to make. More than being a film about uncomfortable choices it is a film about human growth (Toby McGuire) and human frailties (Delroy Lindo). When a apparent decent person cannot rise above his weaknesses and be a responsible civilized being - there lies a story. Delroy Lindo plays his part so well that even when he does something so terrible you could not possibly forgive him, you still feel bad for him.The film takes place during the early stages of the second world war when the depression years are still heavy on everyone's mind. The time period is well done in the actions and the faces of the people.

The first couple who took him was disapointed because he didn't cry (orphan babies don't cry).  The second couple made Homer cry by abusing him.Homer became Dr. Larch's apprentice, tending the sick children, delivering women of babies they're surrendering, but Homer drew the line at aborting babies. It was against the law.Larch advises Homer when he leaves that he will find harsher conditions out in the world, but will be unable to do as much as the orphanage could.When a young couple Wally and Candy (Rudd and Theron) come to get an abortion, Homer leaves with them.  While Wally is off to fly in World War II, Homer works in Wally's family orchard, picking apples.There he learns about the Cider House Rules.  There's a whole wall of them posted on the migrant workers' bunkhouse.  Only thing is, Wally is the only one who can read them.  The rest of the itinerant laborers cannot read. He learns just how germane those rules are to the people who have to live out in the world.The movie is nowhere as strong as John Irving's book upon which it was based.

484141,A26JGAM6GZMM4V,6305949638,Robert Morris,"[6, 8]","Even having John Irving write the screenplay based on his own novel could not prevent this film's insufficiencies which include a lack of cohesion throughout much of the plot development. It begins quite well as the relationship between Homer Wells (Maguire) and Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine) is effectively established. There are issues between them (e.g. pro life versus pro choice) as well as mutual affection and respect. Then the film sags when Homer leaves the St. Cloud Orphanage with Candy (Theron) and Wally (Rudd). He works in the Worthington orchard and falls in love with Candy while Wally is serving in the U.S. Air Force during World War Two. And then....I have great respect for director Lasse Hallstrom's work (My Life as a Dog, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, and most recently, The Shipping News) and do not envy him as he struggled -- with mixed results -- to bring Irving's Academy Award-winning screenplay adaptation to life. There are several magical, memorable moments such as when Dr. Larch and later Homer ""salute"" the children when wishing them goodnight; also when the children compete for the attention of visitors to the orphanage, hoping to be selected. With regard to the acting, Caine received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role and everyone else in the cast performs well. The film score is at times intrusive but the cinematography is first- rate.However, the transitions from St. Cloud to the Worthington orchard to St. Cloud seem to me awkward. Moreover, the Rose family's problems were a distraction which reduced even more the momentum of the film's sometimes lumpy narrative. Overall, this film tries to ingratiate itself with those who see it in much the same way the orphans eagerly surround St. Cloud's visitors, clamoring for their preferential attention.That said, I am pleased to have seen this film and look forward to seeing it again. With all due respect to its charm (in large measure the result of the orphans, all of whom I wish I could adopt), this film raises a number of important issues and addresses them with appropriate respect and sensitivity.",4,"Rules, Lessons, and Poignancy",1076371200,"02 10, 2004",2004,2122,"['Even', 'having', 'John', 'Irving', 'write', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'novel', 'could', 'not', 'prevent', 'film', 'insufficiencies', 'include', 'lack', 'cohesion', 'much', 'plot', 'development', 'quite', 'well', 'relationship', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'Maguire', 'Dr.', 'Wilbur', 'Larch', 'Caine', 'effectively', 'established', 'are', 'issues', 'e.g', 'pro', 'life', 'versus', 'pro', 'choice', 'as', 'well', 'mutual', 'affection', 'respect', 'Then', 'film', 'sags', 'when', 'Homer', 'St', 'Cloud', 'Orphanage', 'Candy', 'Theron', 'Wally', 'Rudd', 'Worthington', 'orchard', 'love', 'Candy', 'Wally', 'serving', 'U.S.', 'Air', 'Force', 'World', 'War', 'Two', 'then', '.I', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'director', 'Lasse', 'Hallstrom', 'work', 'My', 'Life', 'Dog', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'Chocolat', 'most', 'recently', 'Shipping', 'News', 'do', 'not', 'envy', 'struggled', 'mixed', 'results', 'bring', 'Irving', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'screenplay', 'adaptation', 'life', 'are', 'several', 'magical', 'memorable', 'moments', 'such', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'later', 'Homer', 'salute', 'children', 'when', 'wishing', 'goodnight', 'also', 'when', 'children', 'compete', 'attention', 'visitors', 'orphanage', 'hoping', 'be', 'selected', 'regard', 'acting', 'Caine', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'supporting', 'role', 'everyone', 'else', 'cast', 'performs', 'well', 'film', 'score', 'times', 'intrusive', 'cinematography', 'first-', 'rate.However', 'transitions', 'St', 'Cloud', 'Worthington', 'orchard', 'St', 'Cloud', 'seem', 'awkward', 'Moreover', 'Rose', 'family', 'problems', 'were', 'distraction', 'reduced', 'even', 'more', 'momentum', 'film', 'sometimes', 'lumpy', 'narrative', 'Overall', 'film', 'ingratiate', 'who', 'see', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'orphans', 'eagerly', 'surround', 'St', 'Cloud', 'visitors', 'clamoring', 'preferential', 'attention.That', 'said', 'am', 'pleased', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'due', 'respect', 'charm', 'large', 'measure', 'result', 'orphans', 'whom', 'wish', 'could', 'adopt', 'film', 'number', 'important', 'issues', 'appropriate', 'respect', 'sensitivity']",The Cider House Rules VHS

I can't believe this didn't get a R rating --this is NOT a movie for young ones.However, I found the morality of the film problematic. This goes way beyond the issue of abortion, whatever your stance on it. The message of the film seems to be that the ends always justify the means. This is totally epitomised by Michael Caine's Dr. Larch. Whether engaging in illegal abortions, forgery, falsifying records or substance abuse, it seems that this guy thinks that anything is OK as long as he gets the results that he wants. In the end, young Homer does become his successor to this kind of life. This is held up as heroic, somehow, when it is actually tragic.This aspect of the film is the most problematic for me -- the total lack of a moral and ethical center.

484144,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,6305949638,Roland E. Zwick,"[3, 6]","When a film takes place in two entirely different settings - involving almost two entirely different sets of characters - it inevitably runs the risk that one of the two sides will generate more interest than the other  and that the movie itself will appear to break into halves of unequal  quality.  The end result is that such a film may seem to be disjointed and  lacking in the cohesive unity necessary for any work of genuine art.""The  Cider House Rules"" runs the risk and falls into the trap.  The first  section, set in a Maine orphanage in 1943, fascinates us not merely with  the sheer novelty of the setting but with the central figure of the piece,  the doctor and caregiver who becomes the focus of our attention.  Brilliantly portrayed by Michael Caine, Dr. Larch is a man who provides  love to a collection of children otherwise ignored and abandoned by an  uncaring world.  The most controversial aspect of the character involves  the fact that Dr. Larch also provides abortions for women who want them at  a time when the operation was still illegal and the only other alternative  for many of these women was to suffer at the hands of inept practitioners  of the operation.  ""The Cider House Rules"" is certainly to be commended for  tackling a subject that is virtually taboo in commercial moviemaking -  albeit, it must be stated for those who do not adhere to abortion advocacy  that the slant here is decidedly pro-choice despite the script's making a  few gestures to the anti-abortion viewpoint early on in the film.The  center of the film is occupied by a young man named Homer Wells, a  twice-rejected orphan who grows up at the orphanage almost as Dr. Larch's  medical prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and whom Dr. Larch appears to be grooming to take over his  practice from him in the future.  The pseudo father-son relationships  between Dr. Larch and Homer and between Homer and the boys who are in his  charge are conveyed with genuine emotional power and heartwarming  believability.  As prospective parents visit the facility, we feel deeply  the desperation these children have to be adopted and to find a place where  they will fit in.  Conversely, we empathize keenly with the sense of  sadness and personal inadequacy that inevitably accompanies each of their  many rejections.  Even more fascinating is the social context in which the  drama plays itself out.  Because of his willingness to perform the  abortions, Dr. Larch's position at the orphanage has come under attack from  the board of trustees that runs the institution.  Thus, we are all primed  for a gripping showdown between these two opposing forces and wonder how  Homer will fit into the proceedings.Unfortunately, the author John  Irving pulls the rug out from under us as he decides to take his story off  into an almost entirely different direction.  Feeling that he is missing  out on a whole vast world waiting for him beyond the confines of this  remote, isolated community, Homer, rather understandably for a sheltered  young man, decides to abruptly leave the orphanage and to start life anew  as an apple picker when he meets a soldier whose beautiful wife has come to  the doctor for an abortion and whose family is in the cider making  business.  Although Homer's sudden farewell results in a scene of great  emotional power, as a whole torrent of conflicting emotions come flooding  out of both Homer and the people he is leaving behind, the fact is that we  sorely miss the orphanage once we are ripped away from it.  Somehow, the  scenes on the farm - and they constitute well more than half of the film's  running time - never match in intensity and interest those that have come  before.  In fact, the least original and impressive aspect of the film is  the predictable and conventional adulterous affair that Homer and the  soldier's wife, Candy (Charlize Theron), indulge in when her fighter-bomber  husband returns to the war.  Has there ever in the movies been a case of a  beautiful young wife who did not cheat on her husband the minute he went on  a mission overseas?  The theme of the story - as represented by the posted  list of  ""cider house rules"" that we are told by one of the characters are  not too be followed because whoever wrote them didn't live in the cider  house - seems to be that rules are made to be broken, although in some  cases - such as incest - the violation goes so far over the edge that such  an act will always result in disastrous consequences for the perpetrator.  Throughout the film, the characters always seem to be abandoning the rules  set out for them by society.  Dr. Lance performs illegal operations,  creates a phony resume and a set of counterfeit documents in an attempt to  get the board to hire Homer as his assistant, and even deceives Homer into  believing he suffers from a serious heart ailment to keep him out of the  service.  Homer himself seems to suffer little guilt as he pursues a love  affair with the wife of the man who has kindly entrusted him with a job  when he most needs it.More interesting than this theme, however, is  the more subtle one of parents - whether real or ersatz - learning to let  go of the child in whom one has invested all one's dreams and hopes for the  future.  The genuine heartbreak Dr. Lance suffers as Homer leaves to find a  new place in the world becomes almost palpable as written on Caine's  beautifully expressive, craggy face.  Unfortunately, this aspect of the  film is, understandably I suppose, played out almost entirely in scenes in  which letters are exchanged back and forth between the two principals and  in which their feelings are conveyed in the rather undramatic form of  voice-over narration.  In fact, after Homer leaves, Dr. Lance becomes  virtually a minor character in the story and, with his withdrawal from the  scene of action, much of the emotional energy of the earlier portions  drains out of the film.Director Lasse Hallstrom deserves high praise for  the fine performances he has drawn from a uniformly excellent cast.  As  Homer, Tobey Maguire brings a quiet, understated niceness to the pivotal  role. Particularly noteworthy are the young boys who fill the early  sections of the film with so much infectious life and emotion.  They are  cute without being adorable, touching without being cloying.  Hallstrom has  also captured the alternately lush, alternately bleak Maine landscape to  striking effect.",3,a film of strengths and weaknesses,966124800,"08 13, 2000",2000,6445,"['When', 'film',

484145,A2GQOI25E6UY25,6305949638,RolloTomasi,"[3, 4]","Some movies deliberately keep you off-balance, never quite revealing--until the very end--what they're really about.  ""The Cider House Rules"" tops that challenge; it's one of those rare miscalculations that never reveals what it's about at all.  It lurches from subplot to subplot, theme to theme, with all the clumsiness of a vagabond who's had one trip too many to the cider barrel--and yet Lass Hallstrom's touch is so gentle, his direction so graceful, that it's ultimately impossible not to be as moved as you are confused.A chilly Maine orphanage, run by the aging, ether-addicted Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), serves as the film's initial setting.  Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire) is a precocious but withdrawn young orphan who demonstrates great potential to be a doctor.  When a young couple, Lt.Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) and Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron) arrive at the orphanage to have their child aborted by Dr. Larch, Homer leaves his home to follow them.  He eventually becomes a hired hand at Worthington's apple plantation--and from there, well, suffice it to say that the plot doesn't just thicken, it curdles.""The Cider House Rules"" was adapted by John Irving from his own novel, and it's plain to see that the serious issues he tackles were probably given far richer treatment on the page.  In a two-hour film, they're forced to compete for your attention.  It's not really about orphans (although there are enough cutesy shots of their pinched little faces to make you think so at first), although again, what it really IS about is indeed a profound question.  Illicit love, abortion, incest, murder--these are not subjects to give short shrift to, and ""The Cider House Rules,"" frustrated by its own schizophrenic tendencies, never really does full justice to any of them.  Even the inevitable explanation of its title is such a hokey, contrived bit of symbolism that it feels like yet another unnecessary appendage.What keeps this film afloat, and makes it far more rewarding than it deserves to be, is the superb cast.  Caine won an Oscar for his portrayal of the occasionally cantankerous but genuinely sympathetic doctor, and he shares a remarkable father-son chemistry with Maguire.  Also good are Rudd, Theron, and Delroy Lindo as one of the hired hands, although his character is never satisfyingly explored.  This being a Hallstrom film, the feel-good sentiment is in full force (although never as cloyingly as in the loathsome ""Chocolat""), but this is one time I didn't mind.  The music soars, the settings are enough to make you want to go out and be an apple-picker, and dash it all, those orphans ARE pretty darn cute.  What a pity Hallstrom couldn't find a more focused narrative to wrap in his warm little blanket.",3,Is there a point?,994723200,"07 10, 2001",2001,2747,"['movies', 'deliberately', 'keep', 'off-balance', 'never', 'quite', 'revealing', 'very', 'end', 'what', ""'re"", 'really', 'about', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'challenge', 'one', 'rare', 'miscalculations', 'never', 'what', 'about', 'subplot', 'subplot', 'theme', 'theme', 'clumsiness', 'vagabond', 'who', 'had', 'one', 'trip', 'too', 'many', 'cider', 'barrel', 'yet', 'Lass', 'Hallstrom', 'touch', 'so', 'gentle', 'direction', 'so', 'graceful', 'ultimately', 'impossible', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'moved', 'are', 'confused.A', 'chilly', 'Maine', 'orphanage', 'run', 'aging', 'ether-addicted', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'film', 'initial', 'setting', 'Homer', 'Wells', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'precocious', 'withdrawn', 'young', 'orphan', 'who', 'great', 'potential', 'be', 'doctor', 'When', 'young', 'couple', 'Lt.Wally', 'Worthington', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'Candy', 'Kendall', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'arrive', 'orphanage', 'have', 'child', 'aborted', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Homer', 'home', 'follow', 'eventually', 'hired', 'hand', 'Worthington', 'apple', 'plantation', 'there', 'well', 'say', 'plot', ""n't"", 'just', 'thicken', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'was', 'adapted', 'John', 'Irving', 'own', 'novel', 'plain', 'see', 'serious', 'issues', 'were', 'probably', 'given', 'far', 'richer', 'treatment', 'page', 'two-hour', 'film', ""'re"", 'forced', 'compete', 'attention', 'not', 'really', 'orphans', 'are', 'enough', 'cutesy', 'shots', 'pinched', 'little', 'make', 'think', 'so', 'first', 'again', 'what', 'really', 'indeed', 'profound', 'question', 'Illicit', 'love', 'abortion', 'incest', 'murder', 'are', 'not', 'subjects', 'give', 'short', 'shrift', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'frustrated', 'own', 'schizophrenic', 'tendencies', 'never', 'really', 'full', 'justice', 'Even', 'inevitable', 'explanation', 'title', 'such', 'hokey', 'contrived', 'bit', 'symbolism', 'yet', 'unnecessary', 'appendage.What', 'film', 'afloat', 'far', 'more', 'rewarding', 'be', 'superb', 'cast', 'Caine', 'won', 'Oscar', 'portrayal', 'occasionally', 'cantankerous', 'genuinely', 'sympathetic', 'doctor', 'shares', 'remarkable', 'father-son', 'chemistry', 'Maguire', 'Also', 'good', 'are', 'Rudd', 'Theron', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'one', 'hired', 'hands', 'character', 'never', 'satisfyingly', 'explored', 'being', 'Hallstrom', 'film', 'feel-good', 'sentiment', 'full', 'force', 'never', 'as', 'cloyingly', 'loathsome', 'Chocolat', 'one', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'mind', 'music', 'settings', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'be', 'apple-picker', 'dash', 'orphans', 'ARE', 'pretty', 'darn', 'cute', 'What', 'pity', 'Hallstrom', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'more', 'focused', 'narrative', 'wrap', 'warm', 'little', 'blanket']",The Cider House Rules VHS
484146,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6305949638,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[4, 6]","The easy answer is that ""The Cider House Rules"" is about abortion.  Though life is pretty in the WWII New England mileau in which this flick is set, there are still unwanted children (many of whom are sickly) and no shortage of people who would save everybody the trouble of even having children to leave for adoption by getting a (then illegal) abortion.  Homer (Tobey McGuire) is an orphan raised by the saintly Dr. Larch (Michael Caine), and slowly trained to experienced perfection in every aspect of gynecological procedure.  Larch's proto-choice views are tempered (for those with pro-life/anti-choice types) by a seeming boundless compassion for the children housed in his orphanage, and also by the quiet dignity of his debates on the subject with Homer.  Homer staunchly opposes the idea, but the basis for his objection is not as clear (is it blind devotion to anti-abortion laws?  Is he stuck on the idea of life from conception?)  While the two charachters repeatedly discuss the right and wrong of abortion, and Homer reaches an apotheosis by the end of the story when (as if we couldn't see this coming a mile away) circumstances lead him to perform an abortion of his own, the director keeps the subject from becoming the story's focus.  When a young couple (Charlize Theron and Paul Rudd) invite Homer to come away with them, Homer, who has never gone far from the orphanage and hasn't even see the ocean once, jumps at the chance.  Leaving the hopelessness of Larch's orphanage (and the possibility he may have to perform the procedure that dare not mention its name), Homer joins a community of migrant laborers working for Theron's family.  Becoming an Apple-picker, Homer sees a world more rustic than he had ever known.  There is a sort of honesty to the hardy life of migrant labor, one that initially entrances Homer with its sincerity.  (The title takes its name from the sets of rules posted by Theron's mother in the living quarters for the workers.  Hoemr decides to return the favor by posting some rules of his own.)  The world of cider-making seems no-less mythic and insulated from the rest of the world than the orphanage, but Homer soon learns otheriwse.  An illicit affair with Charlize Theron and the specter of incest weaken Homer's once rock-solid resolve to his morals.But it's all so forced.  Mcquire's passion for Theron seems so perfunctory - it comes out of nowehere.  And the supporting charachters- migrant-workers who spearhead the sea-change in Homer's anti-abortion views seem to exist only for that purpose: whether abortion or simply not smoking in the cider-house, Homer's instinct is to follow the rules.  But the workers and Theron's charachter seem to exist only to break Homer down.  It's impossible to say how hard the effort is because Homer seems to collapse whenever the chance arises.  The passage of time (which seems as ephemeral as in ""Aspen Extreme"") doesn't help - just how long has Homer held out before giving in?  Instead of confronting the abortion issue, the script is happy enough to turn Homer around until he is ready to assume the mantle of Larch himself. Whether you agree with choice/abortion or not, there is no underscoring the trauma that turns Homer around.  Thus ""Cider House Rules"" disengenuously takes the tragedy of moral compromise and serves it up as a triumph.",2,What is this about anyway?,977788800,"12 26, 2000",2000,3346,"['easy', 'answer', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'abortion', 'life', 'pretty', 'WWII', 'New', 'England', 'mileau', 'flick', 'set', 'are', 'still', 'unwanted', 'children', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'sickly', 'shortage', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'save', 'everybody', 'trouble', 'even', 'having', 'children', 'leave', 'adoption', 'getting', 'then', 'illegal', 'abortion', 'Homer', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'orphan', 'raised', 'saintly', 'Dr.', 'Larch', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'slowly', 'trained', 'experienced', 'perfection', 'aspect', 'gynecological', 'procedure', 'Larch', 'proto-choice', 'views', 'are', 'tempered', 'pro-life/anti-choice', 'types', 'seeming', 'boundless', 'compassion', 'children', 'housed', 'orphanage', 'also', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'debates', 'subject', 'Homer', 'Homer', 'staunchly', 'idea', 'basis', 'objection', 'not', 'clear', 'blind', 'devotion', 'anti-abortion', 'laws', 'stuck', 'idea', 'life', 'conception', 'two', 'charachters', 'repeatedly', 'discuss', 'right', 'wrong', 'abortion', 'Homer', 'apotheosis', 'end', 'story', 'when', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'circumstances', 'lead', 'perform', 'abortion', 'own', 'director', 'subject', 'becoming', 'story', 'focus', 'When', 'young', 'couple', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'Paul', 'Rudd', 'invite', 'come', 'away', 'Homer', 'who', 'never', 'gone', 'far', 'orphanage', ""n't"", 'even', 'see', 'ocean', 'once', 'jumps', 'chance', 'Leaving', 'hopelessness', 'Larch', 'orphanage', 'possibility', 'may', 'have', 'perform', 'procedure', 'not', 'mention', 'name', 'Homer', 'community', 'migrant', 'laborers', 'working', 'Theron', 'family', 'Becoming', 'Apple-picker', 'Homer', 'world', 'more', 'rustic', 'had', 'ever', 'known', 'sort', 'honesty', 'hardy', 'life', 'migrant', 'labor', 'one', 'initially', 'Homer', 'sincerity', 'title', 'name', 'sets', 'rules', 'posted', 'Theron', 'mother', 'living', 'quarters', 'workers', 'Hoemr', 'return', 'favor', 'posting', 'rules', 'own', 'world', 'cider-making', 'no-less', 'mythic', 'insulated', 'rest', 'world', 'orphanage', 'Homer', 'soon', 'otheriwse', 'illicit', 'affair', 'Charlize', 'Theron', 'specter', 'incest', 'Homer', 'once', 'rock-solid', 'resolve', 'morals.But', 'so', 'forced', 'Mcquire', 'passion', 'Theron', 'so', 'perfunctory', 'nowehere', 'supporting', 'charachters-', 'migrant-workers', 'who', 'spearhead', 'sea-change', 'Homer', 'anti-abortion', 'views', 'seem', 'exist', 'only', 'purpose', 'abortion', 'simply', 'not', 'smoking', 'cider-house', 'Homer', 'instinct', 'follow', 'rules', 'workers', 'Theron', 'charachter', 'seem', 'exist', 'only', 'break', 'Homer', 'down', 'impossible', 'say', 'how', 'hard', 'effort', 'Homer', 'collapse', 'whenever', 'chance', 'arises', 'passage', 'time', 'as', 'ephemeral', 'Aspen', 'Extreme', ""n't"", 'help', 'just', 'how', 'long', 'Homer', 'held', 'out', 'giving', 'Instead', 'confronting', 'abortion', 'issue', 'script', 'happy', 'enough', 'turn', 'Homer', 'ready', 'assume', 'mantle', 'Larch', 'agree', 'choice/abortion', 'not', 'underscoring', 'trauma', 'Homer', 'Thus', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'disengenuously', 'tragedy', 'moral', 'compromise', 'up', 'triumph']",The Cider House Rules VHS

Then we have a guy who he is having sex with his daughter and gets her pregnat. I guess it's OK because he truly loves her, oh and of course his life was also hard. Then we have the doctor in the orphonage, who instead of incentivating Homer (our ""hero"") to grow as a person lied to him his whole life about his health so Homer would stay with him.

484150,A28364B5MYR96B,6305949638,"Sonny ""BCAT""","[5, 6]","The Cider House Rules is a compelling film for the very reason that other posters have dismissed it.  Its characters are human in that they are fallable.  All of the characters are tainted in some way or another by their own actions.The story follows Homer (Tobey Magiure) on his journey discovering himself outside the orphanage in which he was raised.  Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) is an ether addicted, abortion performing doctor who also runs the orphanage.  Dr. Larch has taught Homer everything he knows and would like for Homer to be his successor at the orphanage.  Homer has never attended Medical School, but Dr. Larch has and insists since he has imparted all his knowledge to Homer that Homer must too be qualified.  Homer has other ideas.Homer leaves the orphanage with a young man and his girlfriend who have come to the orphanage to engage Dr. Larch's services.  He sees it as a chance to see the world, and he does, to a degree.  He sees two things of note: the ocean and beautiful Charlize Theron.  He begins an affair with her while her boyfriend is at war and works picking apples for cider.The characters here are all wonderfully developed except for the orphans and all of the characters are tainted by some deed they have done.  Dr. Larch has many vices, and Delroy Lindo plays a father guilty of incest, Homer falls in love with his friend's girlfriend, and vice versa.  But these characters are never absolved for their sins.  They are never forgiven.  They either have to live knowing what they have done or die with the knowledge that they cannot change it.There are pieces of this film that are too sweet to mix with the dark tone hovering over it.  The feel good ending nearly takes the bad taste out of your mouth, which would be tragic, because th epoint of the story is that all of us have done something to make us ashamed.  We are just normal people capable of unforgivable acts, and these mistakes will shape our lives and guide them to our deaths.  It is a bitter pill to swallow, which is probably why the filmmakers coated with sugar and gave it the feel good ending.

484151,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,6305949638,S. Schell,"[3, 5]","There is a lot of debate as to the content of this film and what people  say it advocates or makes light of. For instance, the ongoing battle  between pro and anti-abortionists. Not every woman in this film has an  abortion. Think about the involving circumstances and how tough that choice  is to make. Sometimes there is no other choice. If there isn't an abortion,  then it is another child waiting to be adopted. It is a sad situation with  no way out. There is no benefit to either and this movie only depicts a  good Samaritan at work who listens to these desperate women and gives them  the choice to give the baby away or to take it away. Then there are the  circumstances involving the time period. It was the 1940's, World War II  era. To become pregnant out of wedlock and at such a young age (and most of  these women could not even be called women yet) meant being disowned and  abandoned, left out in the cold. This is something that a girl did not want  to face; being ostracized by both family and friends. So they went to a  back alley doctor and had the dirty deed done but only to the destruction  of their health. This is the point that Dr. Larch makes in the movie when  Homer begins to reveal his issues with abortion. &quot;When they don't come  to someone who can do it correctly and safely, this is what happens!&quot;  he tells him. I will admit that this is a very delicated issue but Michael  Caine's character is the ear that is not often lent to all these women, a  man for all the men in the world who will listen, understand, sympathize  and give them a choice. This is what this film demonstrates, no more and no  less.Now that I am past this argument, I wish to express the reasons for  my deeply felt connection to this movie and the performances reaped from  its distinguished and versatile cast. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Homer  Wells, the calm and self-assured protege of Dr. Larch (Caine) who is  edified on morality at an early age at St. Cloud's Orphanage and Shelter.  The father-son relationship between Homer and Dr. Larch is strongly  detected, and like any parent, he pushed Homer to excel in his medical  practice, endeavoring by illegal means to validate him as a professional  surgeon and general practitioner. Unfazed by Dr. Larch's tenacity, Homer  immediately begins to walk his own path when he spots a blonde beauty named  Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), the girlfriend of a WWII lieutenant named  Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd) who requests an abortion at St. Cloud's. Upon  Candy's and Wally's departure, Homer jumps ship and heads out to unfamiliar  territory, attaining employment at Wally's family orchard. From there he  learns the delicate art of the cider-making business, the art of social  endurance, and the whirlwind of emotion that encompasses true love.Since  her radical stints in movies such as &quot;Two Days In The Valley&quot;,  &quot;The Astronaut's Wife&quot; and &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;,  Charlize Theron has become a recognizable talent in the film industry and  is deserving of her critical praise in this literary adaptation of John  Irving's timeless novel. She is somewhat dizzy in personality at first  impression, but as time goes on, she shows that she is a very sympathetic  and heartwarming character despite her obvious flaws (adulterous). Michael  Caine as the indomitable Dr. Wilbur Larch is once again in top form, a  polished player with an untouchable and keen ability to texture every facet  of his character. I was first introduced to his stellar charm and  surprising comedic abilities as Lawrence Jamieson, the suave con in 1988's  &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;. As for Tobey Maguire, I can only say  that he is a work in progress, one that will dominate the field in a matter  of years. With his cutesy candor in 1998's warm and fuzzy comedy  &quot;Pleasantville&quot; and aside Michael Douglas in 99's &quot;Wonder  Boys&quot;, he is climbing the ladder of recognition at a solid and steady  pace.Little did I know after I watched the film and happened to glance  at the credits, I was surprised to learn that two of the smaller roles were  dominated by musicians, one of forgotten past and one of proverbial  present. Erykah Badu, an R&amp;B crooner with one Grammy to her name so  far, proved to be an impressive actress with little or no training as Rose  Rose, the daughter of Mr. Rose. In a profoundly smaller role but with a few  lines to suffice, Heavy D (a hip-hop presence of the 80's) displays a  minute amount of charm as Peaches, a fellow co-worker on the farm. Who I  was stirred by the most in the supporting roles department, however, was  Delroy Lindo as the loathsome Mr. Rose. His character seems a decent fellow  in the beginning but quickly becomes despicable to the audience after his  sickening affections for his daughter are revealed.Overall, this film  touches base with serious issues, the more pronounced being abortion but  incest, adultery and addiction follow closely behind. Despite the numerous  faults of each of the characters, they all prove that love is the reason  behind their debauched actions. &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; begs to  be understood and appreciated, and there is no argument to how well it  presents itself. One of the best films of '99 standing beside  &quot;American Beauty&quot;, it will reserve itself a place in people's  hearts and movie libraries for all time.",5,All Rules Must Be

484152,AL277B4AQCWBG,6305949638,Steven Reynolds,"[1, 1]","Novelists are notoriously precious about adapting their work for the screen, and usually very bad at it.  John Irving is an exception and a deserving Oscar-winner for this screenplay which recognises the essential differences between a book and a film.  By pushing the history of abortion into the background, compressing the novel's timeline, and working in a little of ""David Copperfield"", Irving manages to reconfigure this story into a tale which is less about abortion and more about finding one's place in the world - and recognising, crucially, that those who want to make the world's rules first have to live in it.  The theme isn't hammered home, but is slowly allowed to declare itself through the experiences of Homer Wells, played with considerable skill and endearment by Tobey Maguire, and Dr. Wilbur Larch, in another great performance from Michael Caine.  This is what an adaptation should be: not a simple translation from page to screen, but a transposition from one register to another, making the film the occasion for a new imaginative experience without losing the qualities for which the novel is so loved.

The film chronicles how Wells, a twice-adopted, twice-returned child was raised with love by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who heads the institution.  Trained by Dr. Larch as a doctor, Homer helps take care of the children as well as deliver unwanted babies.  Homer, seen as a young man with strong morals, decides that illegally aborting unwanted babies is wrong.When a Wally (Paul Rudd), a World War II pilot, and his pregnant girlfriend Candy (Charlize Theron) come in search of Dr. Larch for an abortion, Homer impulsively decides to leave the orphanage and start his life anew.  Homer begins working on an orchard farm where he meets a colorful array of individuals, all with their own unique problems.  With Wally away at war, Homer begins to grow an affinity for Candy, soon blossoming into love.The film moves at a steady pace, albeit one with some flaws, but nevertheless, it remains engaging throughout.  The underlying sub-plot revolving around abortion and the effects it has on families continues throughout the film, even if it seems a little forced.  There is one particular abortion that pulls at the heartstrings, leaving a gloomy atmosphere on the rest of the film.The engaging acting creates characters that the audience can sympathize with as well as grow to love.

484159,A5CWLQF6QO3CN,6305949638,"Tso Haven Hei Wan ""Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","[0, 2]","The title of the movie has spelled out the theme, though it takes you some time to know what it means at the very beginning.Overall speaking, it is  a very balanced movie that can attract your attention to the end. The theme  was dealt with through the dialogues of different characters inside it -  why should someone set down rules for things which they don't really  involved in? The theme was brought up by the abortion controversy and the  cider house rules.Nonetheless, there are some side lines which worth  further thoughts. One of them is the &quot;affair&quot; between Toby and  Charlize, who claimed that she was not good in being alone. Was there real  love between them? Or is Toby just a means for her to satisfy her physical  and emotional desires? That was not really tackled. Charlize returned to  her original boy friend to take care of him, but is this out of love or  duties? In fact, was the affair between her and Toby really necessary? I  tend to take the orientation that, this part of the movie has in fact  spoiled the plot of the movie instead of coloring it. This movie can still  live without emotional love for it still has peer love, love between a  teacher and a student, care among colleagues, friendship etc. Why bother  adding this part to it?The other one was the incest relation of the  cider house rule manager and her daughter. It did provide a dramatic effect  to the whole story and of course it paved way for Toby to return to the  orphanage to succeed Michael's role as the doctor and manager. However, at  the same time, it made the atmosphere of the story very heavy, and  sometimes too heavy for the audience.Michael's view on abortion is  disputable, but worth some deeper thoughts. However I personally do not  agree his doings of faking qualifications, despite it was for good. Also  the management of life and death, the King Kong movie show, the nurses at  the orphanage etc. all added up some good elements to the  movie.Nontheless, the superb performance of each of the roles in the  movie did really help to make the movie a real good one.

Not a &quot;funny, ha ha&quot; joke, but a &quot;predictable, blah blah blah&quot; joke.First, I have to say that the nomination for &quot;Picture Of The Year&quot; that &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; received was stolen from much better films from 1999, such as &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Being John Malkovich.&quot; Second, &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; was just another example of the tired formula of Hollywood sneaking in the Independent Film formula of coming of age and passing it off in a different setting, hoping the audience doesn't catch on. And for the most part, it seems to have worked, achieving Oscar recognition. Tobey Maguire is an excellent actor, so it's sad to see him waste his time on such a predictable script. Especially the last half hour of the movie, which seems to get more jumbled as the movie reaches its end. It's like the author, who was writing the script based on his own book, realized that he only had 30 minutes left to work with, so he had to squeeze 200 pages into that time. The result is a film that feels the audience is far too dumb to understand the messages it's trying to get across, so it bludgeons the viewer into unconsciousness with its message. It's like the film keeps poking you with a stick while asking, &quot;Do you get it yet? Huh? Huh? Do you get it? Bet you didn't see that one coming!&quot; But you know what, you do see it coming.All in all, I'm not trying to tell you what to think on the subject of the film. I'm just saying that the film does a poor job of explaining the material. It's like the film is making up excuses for everything, except for coming up for an excuse for its own failure as a movie.",2,You Can See It Coming From A Mile Away,978998400,"01 9, 2001",2001,1875,"['lot', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'going', 'like', 'what', 'have', 'say', 'quot', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'quot', 'critic', 'own', 'movie', 'review', 'show', 'personal', 'opinion', 'film', 'was', 'joke', 'Not', 'quot', 'funny', 'ha', 'ha', 'quot', 'joke', 'quot', 'predictable', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'quot', 'have', 'say', 'nomination', 'quot', 'Picture', 'Year', 'quot', 'quot', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'quot', 'received', 'was', 'stolen', 'much', 'better', 'films', '1999', 'such', 'quot', 'Magnolia', 'quot', 'quot', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich.', 'quot', 'Second', 'quot', 'Cider', 'House', 'Rules', 'quot', 'was', 'just', 'example', 'tired', 'formula', 'Hollywood', 'sneaking', 'Independent', 'Film', 'formula', 'coming', 'age', 'passing', 'off', 'different', 'setting', 'hoping', 'audience', ""n't"", 'catch', 'most', 'part', 'have', 'worked', 'achieving', 'Oscar', 'recognition', 'Tobey', 'Maguire', 'excellent', 'actor', 'sad', 'see', 'waste', 'time', 'predictable', 'script', 'Especially', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'movie', 'get', 'more', 'jumbled', 'movie', 'end', 'author', 'who', 'was', 'writing', 'script', 'based', 'own', 'book', 'realized', 'only', 'had', '30', 'minutes', 'left', 'work', 'had', 'squeeze', '200', 'pages', 'time', 'result', 'film', 'audience', 'far', 'too', 'dumb', 'understand', 'messages', 'trying', 'get', 'viewer', 'unconsciousness', 'message', 'film', 'poking', 'stick', 'asking', 'quot', 'Do', 'get', 'yet', 'Huh', 'Huh', 'Do', 'get', 'Bet', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'quot', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'coming.All', ""'m"", 'not', 'trying', 'tell', 'what', 'think', 'subject', 'film', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'film', 'poor', 'job', 'explaining', 'material', 'film', 'making', 'up', 'excuses', 'everything', 'coming', 'up', 'excuse', 'own', 'failure', 'movie']",The Cider House Rules VHS

It's not horrible, the themes and subject matter of the movie is highly controversial and might make some viewers uncomfortable depending upon their personal opinions on abortion. Somehow, though, this movie sensitively and affectively conveys the subject matter in a way that's watchable. Even though the acting was mediocre, I really liked Tobey Mcguire as the main character (i think he's such a cutie...). However, i felt that this movie was just way too long. It tends to drag along and barely picks up until it comes to the most emotional scenes, which I have to admit were a bit abject and hard to watch.

I left the theater wondering what the movie thought it was about and was unable to say. It's almost deliberately unfocused; it shows us many events without guiding them to add up to anything definite.&quot;I got up from my bed wondering the exact same thing.  A movie should never leave you with that big of a question.  If it does, it did not accomplish anything, because it is as if it felt it had nothing to accomplish.I was highly disappointed with this film.  It just didn't work on so many levels.  Lasse Hallstrome is probably my least favorite major director at the moment.  It seems he exists solely for Miramax to hire him so they can produce another accessible --no matter how impersonal-- piece of crap such as this in order to garner Oscars and, in the end, more money.Many have said it is an important film because it approaches family and abortion.  But the family aspect was so sparse it felt non-existent for about 75% of the running time.  And the issue of abortion is left at an unfortunately impersonal level, exploring whether or not Tobey McGuire's character Homer finds it moral to use the medical skills his confident Dr. Larch (Michael Caine) has taught him in order to help women with abortion without bringing the issue past Homer himself.  It does not ever leave the television screen.  You aren't left thinking about whether it is right or wrong, or whether it should be legal or illegal, the woman or man's choice.  I would further my point, but I would risk spoiling the film.I think the only thing I truly enjoyed about the film was Charlize Theron.
