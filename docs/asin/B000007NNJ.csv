Variety is neither a ""a Daring Departure Into the Dark, Obsessional World of Female Fantasy,"" nor is it a""sexually-charged tale"" in the sense one thinks of sexually-charged tales. It's intent is not to titillate.It's a character study and a very interesting one. I see parallels here to Taxi Driver; a depiction of urban (NYC) alienation and isolation and an individual's reaction to their environment. Here the character is turning to sex instead of violence.  Which is to say Variety is not a sexually charged tale, in the same way Taxi Driver is not an action movie.It's cerebral, character-driven, meditatively paced.
