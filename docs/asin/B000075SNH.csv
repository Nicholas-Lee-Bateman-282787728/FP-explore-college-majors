Starts off serious, becomes funnier as it goes on (pretend you are in a play and can't leave until intermission -- by then, you will want to stick around).Jill Clayburgh is right on when she describes older men as big babies (she astutely states this after she starts dating an exasparating man her own age who has been unsuccessfully dating younger women). I don't consider Jeffrey Tambor attractive but in this movie I eventually came to like him. Well, not enough for me to date, but fine in the role :)So what did I like about the movie? The truth about how hard it is to find a life partner after a certain age, the truth about how we might still want sex but find getting it to be problematic, the truth about how older women tend to be more attractive than older men but have to settle for homelier than the men do, the truth about if/when we do work out a relationship, it might be worth it.",5,"Wonderful gem of a movie for ""seniors""",1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2013,1014,"['Yes', 'are', 'fifties', 'sixties', 'good', 'intelligent', 'realistically', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'serious', 'becomes', 'funnier', 'pretend', 'are', 'play', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'intermission', 'then', 'will', 'want', 'stick', 'around', '.Jill', 'Clayburgh', 'right', 'when', 'older', 'men', 'big', 'babies', 'astutely', 'dating', 'exasparating', 'man', 'own', 'age', 'who', 'been', 'unsuccessfully', 'dating', 'younger', 'women', 'do', ""n't"", 'consider', 'Jeffrey', 'Tambor', 'attractive', 'movie', 'eventually', 'came', 'Well', 'not', 'enough', 'date', 'fine', 'role', 'what', 'did', 'like', 'movie', 'truth', 'how', 'hard', 'find', 'life', 'partner', 'certain', 'age', 'truth', 'how', 'might', 'still', 'want', 'sex', 'find', 'getting', 'be', 'problematic', 'truth', 'how', 'older', 'women', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'attractive', 'older', 'men', 'have', 'settle', 'homelier', 'men', 'do', 'truth', 'if/when', 'do', 'work', 'out', 'relationship', 'might', 'be']",Never Again

But I almost didn't watch it because of the terrible song that accompanies the opening titles - a song that is totally out of synch with the style and mood of the rest of the film. And what a wonderful film it is. My wife and I have both been divorced twice and we sat nodding our heads throughout the film at its accuracy and honesty in dealing with tentative &quot;never again&quot; relationships. The performances by Jeffrey Tambor and Jill Clayburgh are terrific. Anyone who only knows Tambor from The Larry Sanders Show will be amazed by his subtlety and depth. The script and direction are near perfect - the dialogue is people talking like real people (albeit very witty real people). The film successfully blends great comic moments with honest emotions and human behavior. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever had a relationship break up or fall apart (that's pretty much all of us, isn't it?). The film offers hope without sugar-coated optimism. More importantly, it is also highly entertaining.
