I can't stand the Twilight series and I haven't gotten into any of the new novels of that style that have followed the recent Teen vampire books craze. But this movie I actually enjoyed. Some of it is corny, but in a good way. You can tell whoever wrote the script didn't take it so seriously it missed it's ""kiddie"" mark, but at the same time wrote like they were writing for someone with an actual IQ. In other words, the lines are good, and even the 'stupid-funny' gags are reasonably enjoyable. Acting is good too. We have Anna Popplewell (Susan from Narnia) in this, as well as that dude that plays John Faa in Golden Compass/the mayor in Dinotopia; both of whom are very good at what they do. No second-rate acting there. Also, I noticed the vampire mother is the same actress who played the mayor's wife in Dinotopia, and I enjoyed her acting too.The main reason I bought this movie, however, was to get a closer look than low-quailty youtube at some of the costumes. Whoever did the vampires' clothes for this movie was brillant. I loved those!My one complaint is that, when I got my dvd in the mail, it was rattling round in the package and I, disappointedly, was afraid it might be scratched up and skip. And here I had been so excited to get my movie. Thankfully, I've watched it once on my blu-ray player and that doesn't seem to be the case. It appears to play fine in spite of it's not so good handling. Still, I would want Amazon/the postal service to pay more attention to something like that. Cuz it COULD have been broken. I was just lucky this time.",4,"For a vampire movie, it's actually pretty good!",1328313600,"02 4, 2012",2012,1611,"[""'m"", 'not', 'biggest', 'fan', 'Vampire', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'Twilight', 'series', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'new', 'novels', 'style', 'have', 'followed', 'recent', 'Teen', 'vampire', 'books', 'craze', 'movie', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'corny', 'good', 'way', 'can', 'tell', 'wrote', 'script', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'so', 'seriously', 'missed', 'kiddie', 'mark', 'same', 'time', 'wrote', 'were', 'writing', 'someone', 'actual', 'IQ', 'other', 'words', 'lines', 'are', 'good', 'even', ""'stupid-funny"", 'gags', 'are', 'reasonably', 'enjoyable', 'Acting', 'good', 'too', 'have', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', 'Susan', 'Narnia', 'as', 'well', 'dude', 'John', 'Faa', 'Golden', 'Compass/the', 'mayor', 'Dinotopia', 'whom', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'No', 'second-rate', 'acting', 'there', 'Also', 'noticed', 'vampire', 'mother', 'same', 'actress', 'who', 'played', 'mayor', 'wife', 'Dinotopia', 'enjoyed', 'acting', 'too.The', 'main', 'reason', 'bought', 'movie', 'however', 'was', 'get', 'closer', 'look', 'low-quailty', 'youtube', 'costumes', 'did', 'vampires', 'clothes', 'movie', 'was', 'brillant', 'loved', 'one', 'complaint', 'when', 'got', 'dvd', 'mail', 'was', 'rattling', 'round', 'package', 'disappointedly', 'was', 'afraid', 'might', 'be', 'scratched', 'up', 'skip', 'here', 'had', 'been', 'so', 'excited', 'get', 'movie', 'Thankfully', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'once', 'blu-ray', 'player', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'case', 'play', 'fine', 'spite', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'handling', 'Still', 'would', 'want', 'Amazon/the', 'postal', 'service', 'pay', 'more', 'attention', 'something', 'Cuz', 'COULD', 'have', 'been', 'broken', 'was', 'just', 'lucky', 'time']",N/A

Tony is having a hard time fitting in and making new friends and begins having really vivid bad dreams about vampires.  Then one night, the dreams turn to reality when a small vampire invades Tony's room, trying to hide from a Vampire hunter, intent on ridding the countryside of all it's 'undead' inhabitants.Fortunately, these 'undead' are not really interested in munching on the human population all that much.  They are all members of the clan of Sackville-Bagg who have found that there is a way in which they can become human, if they can only locate and recover a lost medallion by the time of the full moon.With lots of help from Tony, they try to stay one step ahead of the Vampire hunter and complete the quest for freedom from vampirism.Without doubt, Jonathan Lipnicki is one of the most charming and natural actors around.  I have loved every role of his that I have seen and ""Tony"" is no exception. Whether he is 'vamping it up' with fake vampire fangs and a cape or joyfully flying through the air with his new friend Rudolph, he is a treat to watch.The younger actors, Rollo Weeks, Anna Popplewell and Dean Cook as a rebellous teenager are also excellent and likable as the vampire kids.  Other favorite characters are Richard E Grant and Alice Krige as loving parents to their little brood of vampirettes and the scene when they meet Tony's parents and charm them into a trip to the bluff is hilarious.This is a really good, wholesome family movie that will entertain all the members of the family from the youngsters all the way up to Grandma.  It's not saccharin sweet and has a little bit of an edge but is gentle enough that it won't give even the little kids nightmares.I've viewed this movie several times and still enjoy it every time!

So what a surprise to find them flapping bat wings in a children's film.Of course, the monsters in The Little Vampire are considerably toned down from the frightening undead of the Dracula myth. Now they're just the thing to entertain grade-school trick-or-treaters, though they're probably too scary for preschoolers and too tame for teens.For openers, these vampires no longer suck human blood: They restrict their nocturnal feedings to cows.With Mom and Dad vampire caring diligently for their three fang-sporting children, they also express family values more than most of today's Hollywood human families.And when they befriend a young human (the easily lovable Jonathan Lipnicki), they treat him decently -- even taking him for moonlit flights.Lipnicki (the bespectacled youngster from Jerry Maguire) plays Tony, a 9-year-old recently arrived in Scotland with his parents.But Tony has found himself in the midst of a 300-year vampire legend -- an 18th-century aristocratic family from the region now roams the moors, while a mean-spirited vampire-killer pursues.Tony befriends a boy (played by Rollo Weeks) who seems his age -- though he's actually been 9 for 300 years. The two help the vampire family battle the villainous vamp-killer, find a magic amulet and attempt to restore the vampires to humanity.Enough of the plot makes sense to at least allow young viewers to enjoy these characters -- especially the adventurous Tony. The story reflects the overactive imagination of an out-of-sorts, recently uprooted boy.The Little Vampire offers limited enjoyment, at best, for teen and adult viewers, but for its target crowd -- say, 7 to 11 -- it has some entertaining bite.",2,The Little Vampire (DVD),1140825600,"02 25, 2006",2006,1758,"['Vampires', 'are', 'violent', 'scary', 'oversexed', 'denizens', 'horror', 'tradition', 'So', 'what', 'surprise', 'find', 'flapping', 'bat', 'wings', 'children', 'film.Of', 'course', 'monsters', 'Little', 'Vampire', 'are', 'considerably', 'toned', 'down', 'frightening', 'undead', 'Dracula', 'myth', 'Now', ""'re"", 'just', 'thing', 'entertain', 'grade-school', 'trick-or-treaters', ""'re"", 'probably', 'too', 'scary', 'preschoolers', 'too', 'tame', 'teens.For', 'openers', 'no', 'longer', 'suck', 'human', 'blood', 'restrict', 'nocturnal', 'feedings', 'cows.With', 'Mom', 'Dad', 'vampire', 'caring', 'diligently', 'three', 'fang-sporting', 'children', 'also', 'express', 'family', 'values', 'more', 'most', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'human', 'families.And', 'when', 'befriend', 'young', 'human', 'easily', 'lovable', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki', 'treat', 'decently', 'even', 'taking', 'moonlit', 'flights.Lipnicki', 'bespectacled', 'youngster', 'Jerry', 'Maguire', 'Tony', '9-year-old', 'recently', 'arrived', 'Scotland', 'parents.But', 'Tony', 'found', 'midst', '300-year', 'vampire', 'legend', '18th-century', 'aristocratic', 'family', 'region', 'now', 'moors', 'mean-spirited', 'vampire-killer', 'pursues.Tony', 'boy', 'played', 'Rollo', 'Weeks', 'who', 'age', 'actually', 'been', '9', '300', 'years', 'two', 'help', 'vampire', 'family', 'battle', 'villainous', 'vamp-killer', 'find', 'magic', 'amulet', 'attempt', 'restore', 'vampires', 'humanity.Enough', 'plot', 'sense', 'least', 'allow', 'young', 'viewers', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'especially', 'adventurous', 'Tony', 'story', 'overactive', 'imagination', 'out-of-sorts', 'recently', 'uprooted', 'boy.The', 'Little', 'Vampire', 'limited', 'enjoyment', 'best', 'teen', 'adult', 'viewers', 'target', 'crowd', 'say', '7', '11', 'entertaining', 'bite']",N/A

His Dad is developing the McCashton Golf Resort and Convention Center for Sir McCashton. He's being bullied by McCashton's grandsons, Nigel and Flint, and hasn't made any friends. Part of the problem is that he insists on insisting that vampires are real.His teacher tells the class, ""On Saturday night, we'll be able to see the comet [Attamon] in conjunction with the moon, for the first time in 300 years. And then...""Tony interrupts, ""... and then a beam of light comes from the moon.""Classmates giggle as the teacher says, ""As usual, our American friend is full of stories. What makes you say that?""Tony: ""I dreamt it.... I've dreamt it every night since I've been here. And there's a gathering.""Teacher: ""A gathering of what?""Tony: ""A gathering of vampires.... I really saw it! The comet, the beam of light, the vampires and the vampire hunter.""This earns Tony a seat in the hall, disgraced and further fodder for the bullies. As a matter of fact, that night Tony's parents attend a formal party for investors at McCashton's castle. Nigel and Flint tell Tony's parents, ""Tony is our favorite plaything.""While his parents are at McCashton's party, Tony is home with a baby sitter. He's dressed as a vampire, complete with paper fangs and ketchup blood. What he doesn't know is that down the road, Rookery is warming up his truck. No ordinary truck, it has floodlights and shovels, winches and radar. On the side is the writing:Vampkill Ltd.International Vampyrex TimberensRookery spies a vampire bat and takes chase. The exhausted bat takes refuge in Tony's bedroom, mistaking that Tony's costume makes him a brother. The bat turns into his humanoid form. His name is Rudolph. When he finds out his mistake, that Tony is a mortal, he tries to leave, but he's too weak. He asks Tony, ""Do you know where I can get a cow?""That night the friendship between the 7 year-old mortal and the eternally 9 year-old vampire is cemented. First, as Tony saves Rudolph by finding him a cow. And second, when Rudolph saves Tony from Rookery, who thinks Tony is a vampire also - well, Tony did still have his vampire cape on.Not only do the vampires in the Gathering try to eat only cows, they want to become human again. They can only do the latter if they find a special amulet, lost 300 years ago, and hold it at the exact moment that Attamon crosses the moon.This great family movie was released in 2000. Like the best of family movies, it has humor for all ages. There are funny scenes, for example, with vampire cows and their puzzled farmer, and a hapless cemetery attendant. The vampire hunter is a hoot. And it turns out that there's a logical reason why Tony has had vampire nightmares since his first night in their house.

570645,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B000056T4E,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","I happened to catch this film on cable television and, as I have always enjoyed vampire tales, thought that I would give it a go, although my expectations were not high. Was I ever surprised! Boasting a superior cast, a genuinely interesting plot with some quite funny moments, I was riveted to the screen for the duration of the film.The plot is simple. The Thompsons, an American family of three, are newly transplanted from California to Scotland for business reasons. Bob Thompson (Tommy Hinkley) is designing a golf course for one of the local gentry, Lord McAshton (John Wood). Bob's wife, Dottie (Pamela Gidley), is a stay at home mom to their adorable eight year old son, Tony (Jonathan Lipnicki). It seems that ever since they moved to Scotland and began living in their new home, a spooky old castle, Tony has been having nightmares, and has become obsessed with vampires, who seem to occupy his sleeping, as well as waking, hours. Moreover, Tony is having a hard time adjusting to his new school, as Lord McAshton's sons bully him unmercifully. Tony is not a happy camper.One night, in flight from a local vampire hunter named Rookery (Jim Carter), an eternally nine year old vampire named Rudolph (Rollo Weeks) strays into Tony's bedroom. Suddenly, an unlikely friendship blossoms, and Tony's life begins changing for the better. Rudolph and Tony are very much in sync and attuned to each other's needs. While Tony envies Rudolph's ability to fly, Rudolph wishes that he could see blue sky and morning birds instead of being destined to roam the earth only by night.Entwined in the plot is a mysterious missing amulet that the vampires are seeking, as it has the ability to grant them their dearest wish. Moreover, just as Tony has parents, so does Rudolph. His mother, the ravishing Freda Sackville-Bagg (Alice Krige) and his father, the imposing Frederick Sackvile-Bagg (Richard E. Grant), are initially distrusting of their son's friendship with a human. Rudolph's punky looking older brother would just as soon make a meal of Tony, while Rudolph's younger sister, Anna (Anna Popplewell), becomes smitten with him. Still, the friendship continues to flower, and Tony soon finds himself unceremoniously caught up in the path of the local vampire hunter, along with his new found friends. Meanwhile, Tony's parents have no idea that there is a colony of vampires in their midst.Tony, however, appears to have the capability to help unlock the key to the vampires' current state of affairs through his ability to envision the past. In their efforts to put right what went wrong, Tony and Rudolph search for the amulet that contains the magical Stone of Attamon and have a number of adventures, most of which are funny and will bring a burble of laughter to the viewer's lips. In the end, Tony is called upon to make a decision that can change the lives of Rudolph and his family, forever.The film, which is based upon a popular series of children's books by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg, boasts a well-written screenplay, as well as deft direction. The cast is first rate, and the roles are all well-acted. The adorable Jonathan Lipnicki is irresistible in the role of Tony. Who could not love this kid? Young girls, however, will have their hearts go aflutter over Rollo Weeks.Adults and children alike will enjoy this delightful film. Adults will especially enjoy some of the parodies contained within the film. Look for Rookery's parody of Jack Nicholson's role in ""The Shining"", as well as Anna's parody of the Lauren Bacall role in ""To Have and Have Not"". Those viewers who have seen these films will appreciate how these parodies have been seamlessly woven into the fabric of this film. This is a very enjoyable film that will provide fun for the whole family, as there is something for everyone to enjoy.",5,FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY...,1150934400,"06 22, 2006",2006,3818,"['happened', 'catch', 'film', 'cable', 'television', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'vampire', 'tales', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'go', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'high', 'Was', 'ever', 'surprised', 'Boasting', 'superior', 'cast', 'genuinely', 'interesting', 'plot', 'quite', 'funny', 'moments', 'was', 'riveted', 'screen', 'duration', 'film.The', 'plot', 'simple', 'Thompsons', 'American', 'family', 'three', 'are', 'newly', 'transplanted', 'California', 'Scotland', 'business', 'reasons', 'Bob', 'Thompson', 'Tommy', 'Hinkley', 'designing', 'golf', 'course', 'one', 'local', 'gentry', 'Lord', 'McAshton', 'John', 'Wood', 'Bob', 'wife', 'Dottie', 'Pamela', 'Gidley', 'stay', 'home', 'mom', 'adorable', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Tony', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki', 'ever', 'moved', 'Scotland', 'began', 'living', 'new', 'home', 'spooky', 'old', 'castle', 'Tony', 'been', 'having', 'nightmares', 'become', 'obsessed', 'vampires', 'who', 'seem', 'occupy', 'sleeping', 'as', 'well', 'waking', 'hours', 'Moreover', 'Tony', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'adjusting', 'new', 'school', 'Lord', 'McAshton', 'sons', 'bully', 'unmercifully', 'Tony', 'not', 'happy', 'camper.One', 'night', 'flight', 'local', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'named', 'Rookery', 'Jim', 'Carter', 'eternally', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'vampire', 'named', 'Rudolph', 'Rollo', 'Weeks', 'Tony', 'bedroom', 'Suddenly', 'unlikely', 'friendship', 'blossoms', 'Tony', 'life', 'changing', 'better', 'Rudolph', 'Tony', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'sync', 'attuned', 'other', 'needs', 'Tony', 'envies', 'Rudolph', 'ability', 'fly', 'Rudolph', 'could', 'see', 'blue', 'sky', 'morning', 'birds', 'instead', 'being', 'destined', 'roam', 'earth', 'only', 'night.Entwined', 'plot', 'mysterious', 'missing', 'amulet', 'vampires', 'are', 'seeking', 'ability', 'grant', 'dearest', 'wish', 'Moreover', 'just', 'Tony', 'parents', 'so', 'Rudolph', 'mother', 'ravishing', 'Freda', 'Sackville-Bagg', 'Alice', 'Krige', 'father', 'imposing', 'Frederick', 'Sackvile-Bagg', 'Richard', 'E.', 'Grant', 'are', 'initially', 'distrusting', 'son', 'friendship', 'human', 'Rudolph', 'punky', 'looking', 'older', 'brother', 'would', 'just', 'soon', 'make', 'meal', 'Tony', 'Rudolph', 'younger', 'sister', 'Anna', 'Anna', 'Popplewell', 'smitten', 'Still', 'friendship', 'flower', 'Tony', 'soon', 'unceremoniously', 'caught', 'up', 'path', 'local', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'new', 'found', 'friends', 'Meanwhile', 'Tony', 'parents', 'have', 'idea', 'colony', 'vampires', 'midst.Tony', 'however', 'have', 'capability', 'help', 'unlock', 'key', 'vampires', 'current', 'state', 'affairs', 'ability', 'envision', 'past', 'efforts', 'put', 'right', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Tony', 'Rudolph', 'search', 'amulet', 'magical', 'Stone', 'Attamon', 'have', 'number', 'adventures', 'most', 'are', 'funny', 'will', 'bring', 'burble', 'laughter', 'viewer', 'lips', 'end', 'Tony', 'called', 'make', 'decision', 'can', 'change', 'lives', 'Rudolph', 'family', 'forever.The', 'film', 'based', 'popular', 'series', 'children', 'books', 'Angela', 'Sommer-Bodenburg', 'well-written', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'deft', 'direction', 'cast', 'first', 'rate', 'roles', 'are', 'well-acted', 'adorable', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki', 'irresistible', 'role', 'Tony', 'Who', 'could', 'not', 'love', 'kid', 'Young', 'girls', 'however', 'will', 'have', 'hearts', 'go', 'aflutter', 'Rollo', 'Weeks.Adults', 'children', 'alike', 'will', 'enjoy', 'delightful', 'film', 'Adults', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'parodies', 'contained', 'film', 'Look', 'Rookery', 'parody', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'role', 'Shining', 'as', 'well', 'Anna', 'parody', 'Lauren', 'Bacall', 'role', 'Have', 'Have', 'Not', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'will', 'appreciate', 'how', 'parodies', 'have', 'been', 'seamlessly', 'woven', 'fabric', 'film', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'will', 'provide', 'fun', 'whole', 'family', 'something', 'everyone', 'enjoy']",N/A

570653,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,B000056T4E,Michael J. Mazza,"[14, 15]","&quot;The Little Vampire,&quot; directed by Uli Edel, is an appealing fantasy/comedy for a family audience. The story involves Tony Thompson (played by Jonathan Lipnicki), an American boy whose family has relocated to Great Britain. There Tony befriends Rudolph (Rollo Weeks) a vampire boy whose family is being ruthlessly pursued by a vampire hunter who aims to destroy them.This film portrays vampires as a persecuted minority who really mean no harm to humans (they'll drink cow blood if they need to). The film contains some fun sight gags (many involving vampire cows) and one-liners. There are also some genuinely magical sequences (most notably, some flying scenes).Lipnicki carries his lead role well. And the wonderful Alice Krige (who also played the Borg Queen in &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;) is a delight as Rudolph's sexy vampire mom. But the standout performance is delivered by young Rollo Weeks as the vampire boy. Weeks brings both an ethereal charisma and a childlike ebullience to his character. The vampire performances are enhanced by good makeup and costuming.There are a few slightly scary scenes, but nothing that bothered my 5-year old nephew too much. The accent in this film is on humor, fantasy, family, and friendship. I noticed some holes in the film's explanation of vampirism.

It was a great thing to take children to, and any adult can enjoy it if they don't take themselves too seriously-which I think too many do.  I would have loved it and given it five stars instead of four if not for one thing-I have been reading and enjoying the books they were based on for years and this movie was nothing like it aside from the basis that a human kid has a young vampire friend named Rudolph.  I think the movie could have been improved if Tony had just been older.  The kid who actually played him was too young.  Anyway, the movie was entirely untrue to the story and the feel that Angela Somer-Bodenburg gave to the books was definitely lacking here.  For one, the vampires are now gentle caring wonderful beings.  Every character who wasn't completely out of character for the book was overly done.  Anna, who I thought sweet and charming in the book, is a driveling annoying little thing you just want to drown.  Rudolph's selfishness, cowardice, and double-standard views played well in the book against Tony's responsibility, loyalty, and indignance.  In fact, the only character who was even near being up to code was Gregory, the nasty older brother.  And the way all the vampires in the book seemed to take pride in being vampires was neat too.  Not so in the film.  All in all, I don't want anyone to think I totally hated the movie.  As I said, it was excellent-in itself.

On the way he will form a friendship with a vampire boy called Rudolph.Much of the humour is slapstick, but still not totally overdone. There is also quite an interesting storyline, and special effects are good. It was quite an entertaining feature.One point really did grate on me though, and that was the casting of Tony. No doubt he was chosen on cuteness, but he seemed to me to act an look several years younger than all of the other children - supposedly his age - in the story. He also tended to smile a great deal, which again was cute but sometimes just did not seem to fit the events that were happening in the story.

What a terrible movie.I was expecting a light hearted children's film and instead what I got was a mean-spirited adventure in Christian bashing with scenes that have no place whatsoever in a film aimed at a young audience.The producer's bigotry against Christians is evident right from the start in its depiction of the so-called ""vampire hunter"".He is easily the most disturbing character in the film. For starters his oversized crucifix looks like it was produced at a Las Vegas neon sign factory and his vehicle is a nightmarish cross between a mac truck and a steel mill. If this was meant to be funny, believe me, it wasn't.The worst scene that I saw is when the boy at the center of the film gets trapped in a crypt and a rather large black rat begins crawling towards him.I am flabbergasted that someone would think of this as legitimate children's entertainment. Graves and rats! Are you kidding me?! Absolutely despicable.Throw in more nightmarish images of flying cows and children being given dead mice as gifts and you've got yourself one horrendously bad/disturbing movie that doesn't belong anywhere near impressionable youngsters.I took my little brother and walked out of the theater rather than subject to him to any more of this garbage.Shame on the people who made this.",1,Not a children's movie,1072224000,"12 24, 2003",2003,1345,"['took', 'little', 'nine', 'year', 'old', 'brother', 'see', 'dud', 'What', 'terrible', 'movie.I', 'was', 'expecting', 'light', 'hearted', 'children', 'film', 'instead', 'what', 'got', 'was', 'mean-spirited', 'adventure', 'Christian', 'bashing', 'scenes', 'have', 'place', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'aimed', 'young', 'audience.The', 'producer', 'bigotry', 'Christians', 'evident', 'right', 'start', 'depiction', 'so-called', 'vampire', 'hunter', '.He', 'easily', 'most', 'disturbing', 'character', 'film', 'starters', 'oversized', 'crucifix', 'was', 'produced', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'neon', 'sign', 'factory', 'vehicle', 'nightmarish', 'cross', 'mac', 'truck', 'steel', 'mill', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'funny', 'believe', ""wasn't.The"", 'worst', 'scene', 'saw', 'when', 'boy', 'center', 'film', 'trapped', 'crypt', 'rather', 'large', 'black', 'rat', 'crawling', 'towards', 'him.I', 'am', 'flabbergasted', 'someone', 'would', 'think', 'legitimate', 'children', 'entertainment', 'Graves', 'rats', 'Are', 'kidding', 'Absolutely', 'despicable.Throw', 'more', 'nightmarish', 'images', 'flying', 'cows', 'children', 'being', 'given', 'dead', 'mice', 'gifts', ""'ve"", 'got', 'one', 'horrendously', 'bad/disturbing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'belong', 'anywhere', 'impressionable', 'youngsters.I', 'took', 'little', 'brother', 'walked', 'theater', 'rather', 'subject', 'more', 'garbage.Shame', 'people', 'who', 'made']",N/A

570677,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000056T4E,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 8]","As its title and contents suggest, &quot;The Little Vampire&quot; is a film made mainly for kids in mind, and you cannot disguise that fact in any way.  But the film works pretty well as such, and though adults may feel sleepy sitting beside kids, children would enjoy watching the hectic adventure of Tony, played by sweet brother of &quot;Stuart Little,&quot; Jonathan Lipnicki.  And in this country, instead of pigs, cows can fly, too.  Funny rather than scary, isn't it? (but I feel otherwise should I see that).The film is set in Scotland where newly-moved Tony meets Little Vampire Rudolph.  They soon establish unlikely friendship, and join in great adventure with his vampire sister, to seek for a red stone that can turn them and their clan to humans.The story is simple as that.  But the charm of the film lies not there; for you can enjoy the good cast, especially Lipnicki and newcomer Rollo Weeks, playing together as two darling kids.  Apparently, the risky factors of the original stories by Angela Sommer-Bodenburg are subdued for younger children.  But that is the point, and certainly that makes the film less scarier for them to watch.Frankly I thought the film's script may look too basic for adults, but it was a long, long time ago when I was a kid, and I must admit that I might have felt differently watching this film back then.  So, no more complaint.It is interesting to notice, however, that some of the gags are meant for adult audience (but not many), and one of them is a parody of famous scene of &quot;Shining.&quot;  It was not particularly a good one though, but what I was thrilled to see was Rudolph's aristocratic parents played flamboyantly by Richard E. Grant and Alice Krige.  As you know, Grant was in Coppola's &quot;Bram Stoker's Dracula&quot; while Krige was &quot;Borg Queen&quot; in the &quot;Star Trek: First Contact,&quot; and the latter's hairstyle here ineveitably led my mind to that film.  These facts justly make an impressive entry of this film into a cult classic.",3,When Lovely Kids Fly with Wings....

570679,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,B000056T4E,Z Hayes,"[0, 0]","I remember watching The Little Vampire many years ago with my younger siblings. It was such a charming little story about the enduring friendship between a mortal boy, Tony (played by the adorable bespectacled Jonathan Lipnicki of Stuart Little) and a forever 9-year-old vampire Rudolf.When Tony's parents move him from California to the Scottish highlands, Tony finds himself not only miserable and unable to make any new friends, but also experiencing strange nightmares of vampires. So real are the dreams that Tony actually believes vampires truly do exist, and a chance encounter one night proves him right. Tony meets and befriends Rudolf, and helps his new friend get some nourishment by taking him to a nearby farm where there are plenty of cows.Eventually Tony discovers that Rudolf has an entire family of vampires who have been forced to literally live underground because of a vampire hunter who is bent on seeing them destroyed. Their only hope of salvation is a mysterious jeweled amulet which can give them back what they've always wanted - a chance at a normal life.The effects are certainly cheesy by today's standards, but they are funny to watch. My first grader delighted in watching the antics of Tony and Rudolf, the 'vampire' cows with their blood-red eyes, the way the cows hung upside down in their barn, and the bumbling vampire hunter.Though I'd characterize this as a kid-friendly movie, the recommended age is probably 8 and up (though my first grader was fine with it), as there are some eerie scenes when the vampires bare their fangs which might unnerve younger children. Other than that, there really isn't any violence or overly scary scenes to frighten little ones. The message of friendship across barriers is well-conveyed and the ending will warm the hearts of viewers.",4,A kid-friendly vampire movie that will appeal to grown-ups too,1319328000,"10 23, 2011",2011,1807,"['remember', 'watching', 'Little', 'Vampire', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'younger', 'siblings', 'was', 'such', 'charming', 'little', 'story', 'enduring', 'friendship', 'mortal', 'boy', 'Tony', 'played', 'adorable', 'bespectacled', 'Jonathan', 'Lipnicki', 'Stuart', 'Little', 'forever', '9-year-old', 'vampire', 'Rudolf.When', 'Tony', 'parents', 'move', 'California', 'Scottish', 'highlands', 'Tony', 'not', 'only', 'miserable', 'unable', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'also', 'experiencing', 'strange', 'nightmares', 'vampires', 'So', 'real', 'are', 'dreams', 'Tony', 'actually', 'vampires', 'truly', 'do', 'exist', 'chance', 'encounter', 'one', 'night', 'right', 'Tony', 'meets', 'befriends', 'Rudolf', 'new', 'friend', 'get', 'nourishment', 'taking', 'nearby', 'farm', 'where', 'are', 'plenty', 'cows.Eventually', 'Tony', 'discovers', 'Rudolf', 'entire', 'family', 'vampires', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'forced', 'literally', 'live', 'underground', 'vampire', 'hunter', 'who', 'bent', 'seeing', 'destroyed', 'only', 'hope', 'salvation', 'mysterious', 'jeweled', 'amulet', 'can', 'give', 'back', 'what', ""'ve"", 'always', 'wanted', 'chance', 'normal', 'life.The', 'effects', 'are', 'certainly', 'cheesy', 'today', 'standards', 'are', 'funny', 'watch', 'first', 'grader', 'delighted', 'watching', 'antics', 'Tony', 'Rudolf', ""'vampire"", 'cows', 'blood-red', 'eyes', 'way', 'cows', 'hung', 'upside', 'down', 'barn', 'bumbling', 'vampire', 'hunter.Though', ""'d"", 'characterize', 'kid-friendly', 'movie', 'recommended', 'age', 'probably', '8', 'up', 'first', 'grader', 'was', 'fine', 'are', 'eerie', 'scenes', 'when', 'vampires', 'bare', 'fangs', 'might', 'unnerve', 'younger', 'children', 'Other', 'really', ""n't"", 'violence', 'overly', 'scary', 'scenes', 'frighten', 'little', 'ones', 'message', 'friendship', 'barriers', 'well-conveyed', 'ending', 'will', 'warm', 'hearts', 'viewers']",N/A
