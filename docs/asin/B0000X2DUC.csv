Tremors 4, sadly, isn't even all that funny.  The film is way too talkly, with very little action to speak of.  Yeah, it's cool to see the beginning of the &quot;graboids,&quot; and Michael Gross deserves credit for his 180 degree turn from our beloved Bert Gummer.  And the film isn't without its minor charms (the town of Perfection--as much a character in this series as Gummer himself--started out with the lamentable name &quot;Rejection&quot;), and those may be enough to satisfy die-hard fans.In the supplemental materials, the crew (and Gross) liken this film to the original Tremors.

Unfortunately Tremors IV was like the episodes of the TV series that did not have Burt in them, slow. Much of the plot centers around how not like Burt his ancestor Hiram was. This was funny for about 10 minutes. The movie just rarely really got going, I was frequently waiting for something to happen. The brief part of the movie with Black Hand Kelly and the final showdown in Rejection were the highlights and made this a reasonably entertaining film. The punt gun was hilarious, as was the saw scene. Regretably the majority of the movie was paced a tad too slow compared to the previous three movies. I did like the concept of showing the monsters in pre worm format in a movie that is a prequel. Goes with the whole &quot;pre&quot; theme.The extras on the DVD are a nice plus. Some of the deleted scenes are pretty funny, such as Black Hand Kelly going into the mine and acting like he's being attacked. The bloopers were nothing special, just people messing up their lines and cursing. The documentary extras were interesting, such as the special effects and Michael Gross interview. Overall a decent DVD, but do not expect the same quality plot and action as the previous three movies.",3,"Not bad, but needed something more",1079136000,"03 13, 2004",2004,1327,"['must', 'say', 'love', 'earlier', 'Tremors', 'movies', 'Even', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'fun', 'too', 'watch', 'particularly', 'when', 'Burt', 'was', 'feature', 'character', 'Unfortunately', 'Tremors', 'IV', 'was', 'episodes', 'TV', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'Burt', 'slow', 'Much', 'plot', 'centers', 'how', 'not', 'Burt', 'ancestor', 'Hiram', 'was', 'was', 'funny', '10', 'minutes', 'movie', 'just', 'rarely', 'really', 'got', 'going', 'was', 'frequently', 'waiting', 'something', 'happen', 'brief', 'part', 'movie', 'Black', 'Hand', 'Kelly', 'final', 'showdown', 'Rejection', 'were', 'highlights', 'made', 'reasonably', 'entertaining', 'film', 'punt', 'gun', 'was', 'hilarious', 'was', 'saw', 'scene', 'Regretably', 'majority', 'movie', 'was', 'paced', 'tad', 'too', 'slow', 'compared', 'previous', 'three', 'movies', 'did', 'concept', 'showing', 'monsters', 'pre', 'worm', 'format', 'movie', 'prequel', 'whole', 'quot', 'quot', 'extras', 'DVD', 'are', 'nice', 'plus', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'pretty', 'funny', 'such', 'Black', 'Hand', 'Kelly', 'going', 'mine', 'acting', 'being', 'attacked', 'bloopers', 'were', 'nothing', 'special', 'just', 'people', 'messing', 'up', 'lines', 'cursing', 'documentary', 'extras', 'were', 'interesting', 'such', 'special', 'effects', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'interview', 'Overall', 'decent', 'DVD', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'same', 'quality', 'plot', 'action', 'previous', 'three', 'movies']",N/A

This time the action moves to the Old West, where the burrowing graboids (this time christened ""dirt dragons"" or something like that) have killed all the workers at a silver mine near the town of Rejection.  Prissy Eastern mineowner Gummer (Michael Gross), an ancestor of the later gun nut, comes out to investigate why profits from the mine have declined so precipitously.Although the change of era is inspired, this film just seems to be going through the motions.  I wouldn't have expected the filmmakers to get even two good films out of the premise of burrowing worm monsters, but going for four was definitely overreaching.  There is a lot of self-referential jokiness that might appeal to fans of the franchise, but I found it tiresome.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[0, 0]","In the 1980s, monstrous prehistoric creatures known as graboids attacked the tiny town of Perfection... but as it turns out, it wasn't the first time. ""Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins"" jumps a whole century back in time to show how the whole mess began, but it maintains the same mixture of humor, splattery action and ingenious methods that the other movies have had. Plus, Hiram Gummer!People are flooding out of the tiny mining town of Rejection, because something has been killing men down in the silver mine -- there are only a handful of ex-miners and small businessmen (and women) in Rejection, because they can't afford to leave. The mine's owner, Hiram Gummer (Michael Gross) arrives to see what the trouble is -- only for the small band of miners he hired to be attacked by a bunch of weird carnivorous monsters, which Mr. Chang names ""dirt dragons.""Hoping to reclaim the mine, Gummer hires a lethal gunslinger called Black Hand Kelly, only to discover that the dirt dragons have become monstrously huge -- and they're headed right for Rejection, where they'll devour anything that makes noise. Can the people of Rejection make a last stand against the omnivorous monsters, or is this the end of the steadfast little town?""Tremors 4 - The Legend Begins"" is the sort of movie they call Weird West -- it ends up being a cross between a dusty spaghetti western and a monster B-movie. It's a bit less humorous than the other three movies in this series, although Hiram Gummer's dandyish Philadelphia ways are a lot of fun (""I haven't been on a horse since I... since my 6th birthday party. No, actually, that was a camel"").But there's still plenty of explosive guns, splatters of orange blood, frenzied chase scenes, and imaginative ways of killing the graboids (example: a newly-dug flagpole hole). And, of course, we've got the graboids devouring people whole, with some pretty gory results. It's also worth noting that after the lackluster CGI graboids of ""Tremors 3,"" the giant realistic-looking puppets are back -- there's a bit of CGI when the baby ones are bouncing around tackling people, but mostly it's puppets.Gross gets to play Burt Gummer's ancestor, who starts out very different from our gun-happy paranoiac -- Hiram is refined, dandyish and quite cynical, but he slowly grows to appreciate the town of Rejection and its hard-working people.There's also a solid supporting cast: Sara Botsford as the strong-willed landlady, Brent Roam as ex-miner Juan, and Ming Lo, Lydia Look and Sam Ly as the Chang family. Especially fun is August Schellenberg as Botsford's buddy/employee, a tough Indian who has little tolerance for Hiram (""You missed! With a CANNON!"") and a tendency to dig flagpole holes.""Tremors 4"" is a bit less funny than the previous three movies, but it injects a bit of freshness into the ongoing graboid problems of Perfection/Rejection.

Ignored upon it's initial release it's built up a huge fanbase and cult following. It's easy to see why. From a smart and inventive script by SS Wilson and Brent Maddock (Short Circuit 1 and 2) comes an exciting, silly movie with no pretentious delusions.In the desert town of Perfection, Nevada giant, man-eating worms awaken from a long hibernation and begin munching on the townsfolk. The have no eyes but hunt by sound and vibration and they're quick on the uptake and won't fall for the same trick twice.A pair of local handymen (Bacon and Ward), a crazy survivalist (Michael Gross) a not very pretty love interest (?) and some bratty kids band together and hatch plans for escape. But the giant worms, or Graboids, are too hungry to allow that.Full of gory moments and brainless fun, Tremors is not a great movie but much fun and rewatchable time and time again. The DVD comes as a Collector's Edition and has quite a few extras. The 1.85:1 picture is unfortunately non-anamorphic and the sound is Dolby 2.0 made from the original Stereo track. It's not terribly involving but gets the job done.Tremors 4: The Legend Begins 2/5A surprisingly poor sequel this time. Offering us nothing new and no excitement. Set in the 1800's, the town of Perfection, then called Rejection, is becoming a ghost town because the Graboids are gobbling up all the mine workers. The mine owner (Hiram Gummer-Burt's ancestor and complete opposite) comes to town to sort out the problem but proves to be useless. He hires a notorious gunman (the ever-evil Billy Drago) but he proves to be useless too.What is weird about this film is that it provides NO set-pieces for our characters to do anything or prove themselves. Nothing happens and the film seems to drag on for ages with long periods of no Graboid action whatsoever. Weird considering it's directed by SS Wilson who did the Tremors 2 and 3. It doesn't feel like a Tremors film at all. Where's the fun in watching a bunch of period characters learn what we've long known about the mysterious Graboids?Michael Gross is great as Hiram in regards to playing the complete opposite of what he is popular for and showing some range as an actor. But he just doesn't do anything. There is no reason to watch this film.Plus it's not shot on 35mm film but with a TV camera. The 1.78:1 anamorphic picture proves this only further. It really does look like a feature length episode of the Tremors TV show (which I don't think I'll get if it's anything like this, assuming it ever comes to DVD at all) and it's very distracting. The sound is in Dolby 5.1 and is quite good during the tunnelling and gunfire scenes but it's not reference quality stuff by any means.This special two-pack DVD set may seem cool but be warned...there are no inserts in either DVD. An annoying popular and lazy, unimaginative trend currently being practiced by Universal. The first release of Tremors came with an insert that folded out and contained lots of info about the film. I sold that version thinking it'd be included in this two-pack (as Tremors 4 is not available on its own) so be warned anyone expecting to find one. Plus I also got the ugly bilingual cover that doesn't match any of my other Universal DVDs. Make sure you don't get this one.As much fun as the first 3 Tremors movies are the 4 is rotten and makes me want to sell the whole lot as it ruins a great line up.

The first movie had great characters, the second had good, and some annoying.  The third film returned to the same characters, with some added and they were awsome.  This film has pretty faceless characters.  Although the characters are the ancestors of the originals, we can't realy rout for them since they're not that interesting.  And the other guys all get killed in about 5 minutes.  Since it's a prequel, it has alot of little inside jokes for fans from the first movie, which is nice.  The ending is really a ""thank god they didn't screw that up"" sort of thing.  The Tremors filmmakers handled this better than the Alien/Predator filmmakers when they made Alien Resurrection and AvP, which is sad considering Tremors 2-4 are all video releases, and we get stuck with AR and AvP in theaters.  I'd say the best thing about is that Michael Gross's character hates guns, even though we know that Bert is in love with them, so we're sort of frustrated and like ""what's going on"" throughout the film, but the very last scene was great, and a great ending.  The interesting thing about this series is that it sort of gradually makes Bert the hero of the whole thing even though he wasn't the main character in the first 2.  I'd really love to see a Tremors 5.  This series deserves a sequel more than the say, Alien series (and the alien moveis are my favorite of all time, but Fox, has no clue what their fans want, Stampede Enertainment knows what fans are expecting, and delivers it).

This Gummer is different than his descendant in that he does not even own a gun.Well, Gummer and the remaining residents set out to check the mine over and then get rid of the ""dirt dragons"" via a skilled gunslinger.  In the end everyone must pull together to end the menace.Some wonderful foreshadowing of the earlier movies.  We see the development of the general store, Gummer's character, and other small bits.

I liked it that it took place in time way back in the 1800's and was historically correct (with miners and everything-my grandfather was a miner and he really loved the movie and found it authentic).  Movies that take place in the past are always more artistic and I think this movie is a lot like The English Patient and The Godfather but I have to admit I haven't seen those movies.Michael Gross I am glad was in it even though he played the grandson in the first three movies-it makes sense because it was his ancestor this time and so it would look like him-duh!  The action was to the moon-if you love action you should buy this.  The product placement I found to be a little intrusive-even if Cheetos existed in the 1800's I would find it unlikely that giant carnivorous worms would eat them.  I liked the tremors being replaced by CSI.It's hard to think where the series will go from here-the tremors in part 2 could walk and part 3 could fly, now 4 is the prequel like the new Star Wars movies.  I think the next movie should have tremors with eyes and maybe they'll have a time machine so they can go to the future.  Also I would like to see talking tremors-maybe a hannibal lecter type thing.

My love of the horror genre is rivaled only by my love of the western genre, and on the rare occasions where the two genres cross over, you can bet I'm there.  Wisely Tremors 4 goes for a little bit of a different approach by setting the action one hundred years before the first film.  It's still more or less a rehashing of events from the previous movies, but the new setting helps.Before Perfection it was known as Rejection.  The workers have abandoned the silver mine and are afraid to return(and we all know why).  In comes Hiram Gummer(Michael Gross), a snooty rich schmuck who comes to Rejection to see why his mine is no longer making a profit.  He stumbles onto the reason.....Graboids! Or more specifically, baby Graboids.  In this movie they're called ""Dirt Dragons"".  Gummer teams up with the small group of people who've remained in Rejection to take a stand against the Dirt Dragons.  Gummer is not the gun toting survivalist his offspring would produce years down the line.  In fact he doesn't even carry a firearm.  At one point, Gummer hires a gunfighter named Black Hand Kelly(played by none other than the always fun Billy Drago!) to help get rid of the baby Dirt Dragons, only he finds out rather quick that they didn't stay babies for long.  Kelly is the character who introduces the concepts of guns and survivalist thinking to Gummer.Folks complain that this installment is bigger on talk and less on the action.  True, it is.  I personally didn't mind because being a fan of the series I enjoyed seeing how the seeds are planted for what would become Perfection in the original Tremors movie.  It brings the series full circle.  I also liked watching Gummer's change from arrogant jerk to hero.  A big plus is that the CGI isn't present here either.  There's a bit of humor as well, but not as much as the previous movies.

What I did see was enjoyable enough, however, jarking back to the 19th century when Bert Gummer's ancestor fought the first graboids in Perfection.  Good story. Michael Gross as the elder Gummer is great as a man completely out of place in the Old West but adapting rapidly.  Billy Drago is perfect as Black Hand Kelly and is on screen for too short a time in my opinion.  He's one of my favorite villains.I think this movie puts the cap on the Tremors films because there's nothing more to say after this one.",1,Damaged Disk So Couldn't View Entire film.,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",2013,675,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'view', 'item', 'entirety', 'several', 'scuffs', 'four', 'places', 'froze', 'had', 'be', 'fast-forwarded', 'get', 'play', 'again', 'What', 'did', 'see', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'however', 'jarking', 'back', '19th', 'century', 'when', 'Bert', 'Gummer', 'ancestor', 'fought', 'first', 'graboids', 'Perfection', 'Good', 'story', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'elder', 'Gummer', 'great', 'man', 'completely', 'place', 'Old', 'West', 'adapting', 'rapidly', 'Billy', 'Drago', 'perfect', 'Black', 'Hand', 'Kelly', 'screen', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'opinion', 'one', 'favorite', 'villains.I', 'think', 'movie', 'cap', 'Tremors', 'films', 'nothing', 'more', 'say', 'one']",N/A
788548,AM1C02CE4WGPC,B0000X2DUC,"W. Corse ""OldOneEye""","[1, 1]","The original Tremors was a modern-day Western in many respects, with stars Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward playing the two cowboys who became monster hunters against their will.  Michael Gross (Family Ties) played against type as the slightly-skewed survivalist who never saw a firearm he didn't like (or own).  Gross carries the lead role in ""Tremors 4"" as Hiram Gummer, Burt's grandfather, a true ""Eastern dude"" in fancy dress who must travel to Rejection (not Perfection) Nevada to find out why his silver mine has suddenly stopped producing.Hiram Gummer is much closer to Gross's ""euridite gentleman"" persona that he played so well on Family Ties, and the veteran actor has a lot of fun with the role as the story unfolds.  The desperate town actually hires a real live gunslinger to ""fill the monsters full of lead"", yet it is Hiram who must eventually save the day.  There's a genuineness to this film in its respect for its characters and subtle reverence to the pioneer spirit of the 1800's that takes this film to a higher level, echoing the days of classic Western TV shows like Gunsmoke.  The Chinese couple with their young son are the town's immigrants, the forebears of storekeeper Walter Yang in the first film, and the townspeople as a whole form a nice ensemble around Hiram Gummer's increasingly desperate efforts to save the town.As in the original, there is a rootin'-tootin' showdown with the monsters, complete with a cannon(!) that is worthy of Gunfight at the OK Corral, only messier.  Director SS Wilson wisely limited the use of CGI here in favor of the more traditional special effects used in the first film, which allows the monster scenes to broaden instead of detract from the story.In the end the stalwart townspeople win after amassing a sizable body count, but we are shown the birth of Perfection Nevada as they repaint the name on their recently-built water tower, and Hiram receives a wedding gift from his bride-to-be:  a brand-new Gatling gun.  (He's a lousy shot, you see.)  Of course, they all agreed to never tell anyone about the ""dirt dragons"" they had vanquished, otherwise the town would never grow!An excellent bookend on the series, and the only sequel that's proven worthy of the original film.

This film is set in 1889 pretty much 100 years before the events in the first film. In this film Hiram Gummer (Michael Gross aka Burt Gummer in the previous movies and series) a rich, high class snob who owns the silver mines. Its here that the Legend begins as whilst mining the workers employed by Hiram stumble upon the origins of the Grapoids, and subsequently begin to disapear. Hiram can't get the local town people of Rejection to help him kill the Grapoids preventing him from mining, so he has to hire a lean guman. Black Hand Kelly arrives in town, collects his fee and then with Hiram sets about taking on the Grapoids.This is a good film and a vast improvement over the poor series and the very low budget third movie. Michael Gross is on the ball again, playing the Great Grandfather of his better known Character Burt. The film does well to show the change in character of the Gummer's, from snooty businessmen to crazed gun-loving hunters. Also the fact the film moves away from the heavy CGI use seen in the TV Show and 3rd Film and goes back to the Anamatronic Puppet effects seen in the first two films does a lot to make the action more believable and steer it back towards the first movies quality.The only slight downers with the film would be its slow start and the action seens are a little on the short side. Another thing I didn't like is that with this being a 'Straight to Video' production it has a low budget so the cast is pretty much as cheap as possible, so there is some really bad acting. However it didn't stop me from enjoying this film as I have the others in the series. I can only hope they keep the stories coming and hope for Tremors 5.If you're a fan of the Tremors films you'll love this one as its better than the other two movies, but is not as good as the first probably due to the bigger budget and the star cast. Its a step back in the right direction however and is certainly a good film to pass a an hour or two.",5,The Legend Begins,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2081,"['film', 'may', 'be', 'called', 'Tremors', '4', 'very', 'much', 'prequel', 'three', 'movies', 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'TV', 'Series', 'film', 'set', '1889', 'pretty', 'much', '100', 'years', 'events', 'first', 'film', 'film', 'Hiram', 'Gummer', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'Burt', 'Gummer', 'previous', 'movies', 'series', 'rich', 'high', 'class', 'snob', 'who', 'silver', 'mines', 'here', 'Legend', 'whilst', 'mining', 'workers', 'employed', 'Hiram', 'stumble', 'origins', 'Grapoids', 'subsequently', 'begin', 'disapear', 'Hiram', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'local', 'town', 'people', 'Rejection', 'help', 'kill', 'Grapoids', 'preventing', 'mining', 'hire', 'lean', 'guman', 'Black', 'Hand', 'Kelly', 'town', 'fee', 'then', 'Hiram', 'sets', 'taking', 'Grapoids.This', 'good', 'film', 'vast', 'improvement', 'poor', 'series', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'third', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Gross', 'ball', 'again', 'playing', 'Great', 'Grandfather', 'better', 'known', 'Character', 'Burt', 'film', 'well', 'show', 'change', 'character', 'Gummer', 'snooty', 'businessmen', 'crazed', 'gun-loving', 'hunters', 'Also', 'fact', 'film', 'away', 'heavy', 'CGI', 'use', 'seen', 'TV', 'Show', '3rd', 'Film', 'back', 'Anamatronic', 'Puppet', 'effects', 'seen', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'lot', 'make', 'action', 'more', 'believable', 'steer', 'back', 'first', 'movies', 'quality.The', 'only', 'slight', 'downers', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'slow', 'start', 'action', 'seens', 'are', 'little', 'short', 'side', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'being', ""'Straight"", 'Video', 'production', 'low', 'budget', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'cheap', 'possible', 'really', 'bad', 'acting', 'However', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'enjoying', 'film', 'have', 'others', 'series', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'keep', 'stories', 'coming', 'hope', 'Tremors', '5.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Tremors', 'films', ""'ll"", 'love', 'one', 'better', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'probably', 'due', 'bigger', 'budget', 'star', 'cast', 'step', 'back', 'right', 'direction', 'however', 'certainly', 'good', 'film', 'pass', 'hour', 'two']",N/A
