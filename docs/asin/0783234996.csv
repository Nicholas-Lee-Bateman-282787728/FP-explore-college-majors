We learn almost as much about Williams as Dr. Hunter Adams in this story. Because Robin Williams really does have the gift of laughter and compassion, and ability to bring out the human element in even the most irascible people.Hunter Adams got the nickname Patch when he was in a mental hospital, self admitted because he had made a failed suicide attempt. There he discovered, as many people do, that the best cure for ones own troubles is to help someone else. Indeed, I think it's probably the most successful prescription for depression ever devised. There was another patient in the hospital who had been a brilliant physicist, and who could still be seen filling notebooks with arcane formulas. Adams sat and watched him work, and noticed that his notes were being damaged by a leak in his paper coffee cup. So Adams put a piece of tape on it, apparently from some sort of medical wrist-band. He patched the professor's coffee cup, and the professor gave him the nickname Patch.When he realized that he could heal himself with laughter, and help his fellow patients into the bargain, he signed himself out against medical advice and went to medical school. But of course he could not, simply could not, do things the conventional way.He was not even supposed to be in the hospital, because medical students were not supposed to be in contact with patients until their third year. But he snuck in and found himself in a pediatric oncology ward. Cancer patients, bald-headed kids. On an impulse, he took a rubber bulb normally used to irrigate the ears and suchlike, cut off the pointed end, and stuck it on his nose. It looked exactly like a clown nose. He clowned around and made the kids laugh, which of course got him in trouble.I won't spoil it, but there is one other element that needs to be mentioned. A lovely female student caught his attention, but she avoided him. The story of how and why he won her over is touching, and had me personally crying. I suppose I really mean the why of her avoidance of men.See the movie. It really is wonderful. A lot of small details about it are wonderful, and the overall feel of it is equally wonderful.",5,Robin Williams Does This Sort of Thing So Well,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,2211,"['Yes', 'story', 'told', 'lovable', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'learn', 'almost', 'much', 'Williams', 'Dr.', 'Hunter', 'Adams', 'story', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'really', 'have', 'gift', 'laughter', 'compassion', 'ability', 'bring', 'out', 'human', 'element', 'even', 'most', 'irascible', 'people.Hunter', 'Adams', 'got', 'nickname', 'Patch', 'when', 'was', 'mental', 'hospital', 'admitted', 'had', 'made', 'failed', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'discovered', 'many', 'people', 'do', 'best', 'cure', 'ones', 'own', 'troubles', 'help', 'someone', 'else', 'Indeed', 'think', 'probably', 'most', 'successful', 'prescription', 'depression', 'ever', 'devised', 'was', 'patient', 'hospital', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'brilliant', 'physicist', 'who', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'seen', 'filling', 'notebooks', 'arcane', 'formulas', 'Adams', 'sat', 'watched', 'work', 'noticed', 'notes', 'were', 'being', 'damaged', 'leak', 'paper', 'coffee', 'cup', 'So', 'Adams', 'put', 'piece', 'tape', 'apparently', 'sort', 'medical', 'wrist-band', 'patched', 'professor', 'coffee', 'cup', 'professor', 'gave', 'nickname', 'Patch.When', 'realized', 'could', 'heal', 'laughter', 'help', 'fellow', 'patients', 'bargain', 'signed', 'out', 'medical', 'advice', 'went', 'medical', 'school', 'course', 'could', 'not', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'things', 'conventional', 'way.He', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'supposed', 'be', 'hospital', 'medical', 'students', 'were', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'contact', 'patients', 'third', 'year', 'snuck', 'found', 'pediatric', 'oncology', 'ward', 'Cancer', 'patients', 'bald-headed', 'kids', 'impulse', 'took', 'rubber', 'bulb', 'normally', 'used', 'irrigate', 'ears', 'suchlike', 'cut', 'off', 'pointed', 'end', 'stuck', 'nose', 'looked', 'exactly', 'clown', 'nose', 'clowned', 'around', 'made', 'kids', 'laugh', 'course', 'got', 'trouble.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'one', 'other', 'element', 'be', 'mentioned', 'lovely', 'female', 'student', 'caught', 'attention', 'avoided', 'story', 'how', 'why', 'won', 'over', 'touching', 'had', 'personally', 'crying', 'suppose', 'really', 'mean', 'why', 'avoidance', 'men.See', 'movie', 'really', 'wonderful', 'lot', 'small', 'details', 'are', 'wonderful', 'overall', 'feel', 'equally', 'wonderful']",N/A

Patch Adams begins similar to Penny Marshall's Awakenings, also starring  Robin Williams, with a picturesque view of a melancholy scene complemented  by a somber musical score that lulls the audience into the mood of the  film.  Opposite of the artistic intensity and depth of Marshall's  Awakenings, Patch Adams never objectively confronts its overwhelming  sentiment over its subject matter, and it never creatively strives higher  than to portray this eccentric character as some sort of saint or  incrediable do-gooder. There is nothing wrong with dedicating a motion  picture to an intriging or incrediable human being. Patch Adams fails by  impossibly glorifying the main characterbehind all descet suspenion of  disbelief. The film has no obesevable formula-less plot, self-examing  moral, or exuse for all of its ugly and disgusting romanticism for a  fundamentally contraversal character.  Patch Adams falls miserably  short of film artistary due to its lack of seeing the greater cinematic  riches of looking deeper into the character and not just delievering  another movie sterotype.

As a parent, what I really read reviews for is because I want to know is what ratings don't tell you:No nudityI think a little bit of swearing, but not significant.They mention kissing, two brief kisses, the only bed scene is of him fully clothed and her covered by a blanket, he assumably came in only to read a poem.She was fully clothed the entire time**SPOILER ALERT**The only thing that I would hesitate on, was that he did break some of the rules, but they had arguments and counter-arguments about that, so there is a lot of room to expand on that as a parent and talk about whether or not it is ok to break the rules and why or why notThere wasn't violence shown on the screen (as far as I can remember), only the scene up to the violence, and then blacked out, and then explanation by the characters of what happened.It wasn't vulgar, but there was brief context appropriate talk of urine, and a scene of gynocologists walking through paper mache doors made to look like they were walking through a woman's legs into her. But, it was very fake, and made to look fake. There may have been some other vulgar talk that I'm not remembering, but I don't think it was too bad or I'd probably remember it.Overall, great movie.

Most of the serious roles he plays (Dead Poets Society, Awakenings, and Patch Adams, for example) leave me feeling like I am constantly being preached to by some smug righteous know-it-all who has a simple answer for everything.  The only opposition the protagonist gets is from the stuffed-shirt Establishment (boo hiss) which serves as a straw man that can be knocked down with ease.However, I find it just to be more insulting to my intelligence, not to mention lacking in basic humor.  Patch's wacky antics are the sort of stunts I would expect from my 9-year-old, not a doctor who is presumably trying to treat my ailments.Certainly, none of us appreciates being treated in a sterile impersonal manner, but I personally would prefer a doctor who doesn't appear to be a complete jackass.  Studies have certainly shown that patients respond positively to being treated with warmth & compassion, but other studies have shown as well that patients like to see that white lab coat, because it conveys an air of authority and competence that patients find reassuring.Of course the movie completely ignores these complicated issues, because the director is more interested in cranking out a formulaic, paint-by-the-numbers, feel-good Hollywood piece.  It is far easier to resort to manipulating your audience with hackneyed plot devices and clich&eacute;s than try to address serious issues intelligently.

However, this is one of the most cynical emotionally explotative movies I've ever seen.  The movie is like some kind of insidious Pavlovian device designed to ellicit, nay wring an emotional response out of the viewing audience.  From the insanely intrusive and overwrought music to the asinine and oftimes preachy dialog, to the completely predictable plot, it's all designed to make you FEEL and is as subtle as getting hit repeatedly in the head with a shoe.  The attempts to tug on my heartstrings are so blatant, so obvious, so phony that I found them to be offensive. For example: the scene where Patch gets an old and depressed woman to eat by dragging her into a wading pool filled with spaghetti is one of the most stupid, childish, embarrassing, not to mention logistically improbable scenes ever committed to film. At least we suppose she eats because all we see her do is idiotically cavort in the pool and dump spaghetti on William's head. Problem solved! The bad guys, who are cartoonish straw men, and the good guys, i.e. Patch, might as well have been wearing black and white hats for all the subtlety of the music and dialog. Of course Patch's establishment bucking and unorthodox ways are vindicated in a final ""court"" scene which rings as false as it is formulaic. I am not a monkey and don't appreciate being manipulated as though my IQ was that of a chimp. Patch Adams is Robin Williams at his most icky and moviemaking at it's most disingenuous.

65496,A1KT01DYA3C067,0783234996,"Daniel J. Maloney ""Daniel J. Maloney""","[1, 1]","Patch Adams is a very entertaining movie with a serious message. While there are truly stupid scenes that aren't really necessary, the movie as a whole works.Patch is a former mental patient who realizes his greatest  challenge is struggling to find meaning in his life.After a  hospitalization, he decides he wants to devote his life to medicine.  Entering medical school in his mid-forties, he is certainly an anomaly  among the young fresh-faced first year medical students.Adams is bright  and highly determined. He doesn't take everything the professors tell him  at face value but rather, as an intelligent student should, he questions.  In medical school, apparently this is not necessarily part of the pedagogy.  It  appears that what is taught is absolute gospel and no student has a  right to question it if they are going to make it through. Unfortunately,  this seems to be the way medical schools are run. In addition to imparting  knowledge, it seems that these schools are the forums in which ego manical  physicians have the opportunity to show how bright they are and to insult  and offend their students. A sad state of affairs.Patch's questioning  often leads him off to do his own thing in wanting to learn to be the best  doctor possible. At one point, he is entertaining cancer stricken children  (against the Dean's warning to stay off the wards). At another point, he is  comforting a dying patient who is very bitter about the lousy cards life  has dealt him. These things get Patch in trouble despite the fact that they  earn him the admiration of the nurses and the patients with whom he comes  into contact.Ultimately, it's Patch's creation of a communal care  center that gets him thrown out of medical school.He enlists his  roommate (whom he formerly didn't get along with until the kid realized  Patch had something to offer) in helping him fight his expulsion.A trial  is convened and the support for Patch by his fellow students, patients and  the nursing staff is in full evidennce. Nonetheless, he is up against a  formidible board of physicians (who's values he questions).The outcome  is of course a happy one. Patch is reinstated and graduates. He goes on to  work full-time in his clinic helping people at no charge.An  inspirational film with some minor character annoyances.",4,The Way Physicians Should Be Taught,959385600,"05 27, 2000",2000,2316,"['Patch', 'Adams', 'very', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'serious', 'message', 'are', 'truly', 'stupid', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'necessary', 'movie', 'whole', 'works.Patch', 'former', 'mental', 'patient', 'who', 'greatest', 'challenge', 'struggling', 'find', 'meaning', 'life.After', 'hospitalization', 'devote', 'life', 'medicine', 'Entering', 'medical', 'school', 'mid-forties', 'certainly', 'anomaly', 'young', 'fresh-faced', 'first', 'year', 'medical', 'students.Adams', 'bright', 'highly', 'determined', ""n't"", 'take', 'everything', 'professors', 'tell', 'face', 'value', 'rather', 'intelligent', 'student', 'should', 'questions', 'medical', 'school', 'apparently', 'not', 'necessarily', 'part', 'pedagogy', 'what', 'taught', 'absolute', 'gospel', 'student', 'right', 'question', 'are', 'going', 'make', 'Unfortunately', 'be', 'way', 'medical', 'schools', 'are', 'run', 'addition', 'imparting', 'knowledge', 'schools', 'are', 'forums', 'ego', 'manical', 'physicians', 'have', 'opportunity', 'show', 'how', 'bright', 'are', 'insult', 'offend', 'students', 'sad', 'state', 'affairs.Patch', 'questioning', 'often', 'off', 'do', 'own', 'thing', 'wanting', 'learn', 'be', 'best', 'doctor', 'possible', 'one', 'point', 'entertaining', 'cancer', 'stricken', 'children', 'Dean', 'warning', 'stay', 'wards', 'point', 'comforting', 'dying', 'patient', 'who', 'very', 'bitter', 'lousy', 'cards', 'life', 'dealt', 'things', 'get', 'Patch', 'trouble', 'fact', 'earn', 'admiration', 'nurses', 'patients', 'whom', 'contact.Ultimately', 'Patch', 'creation', 'communal', 'care', 'center', 'thrown', 'medical', 'school.He', 'roommate', 'whom', 'formerly', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'along', 'kid', 'realized', 'Patch', 'had', 'something', 'offer', 'helping', 'fight', 'expulsion.A', 'trial', 'convened', 'support', 'Patch', 'fellow', 'students', 'patients', 'nursing', 'staff', 'full', 'evidennce', 'Nonetheless', 'up', 'formidible', 'board', 'physicians', 'who', 'values', 'questions', '.The', 'outcome', 'course', 'happy', 'one', 'Patch', 'reinstated', 'graduates', 'work', 'full-time', 'clinic', 'helping', 'people', 'charge.An', 'inspirational', 'film', 'minor', 'character', 'annoyances']",N/A

Robin Williams is good as the title character here, although credibility is stretched way, way beyond the breaking point throughout this over-the-top production.While ""based on a true story"" (which is undeniable), it is simply impossible to believe that most of the mega-sappy, sentimental fare dished up by the movie-makers in this film is truly ""the way it really happened"". It's all way too pat.And getting back to those last 2 reels.....It's almost too hard to describe the lunacy of them [what with being doubled over from laughter]! As we near the climax of this outing with Robin, Patch's future as a doctor is in real jeopardy, as he is about to be expelled from medical school.His evaluation by the school's bigwigs to determine his fate at the University is a real hoot! This scene was treated by the filmmakers with Perry Mason-type drama, complete with a massive courtroom with balconies, and literally hundreds of observers. My question here would be: WHY would hundreds of strangers turn out in mass to find out if this guy is to continue with his education? Seems completely over-the-top. Looked more like a scene from the O.J. murder case!And the final nail in the coffin is the last scene, during which we get to witness Patch's bare hind quarters during graduation festivities! Why, oh why, would anyone do such a vulgar thing? Even the unorthodox Mr. Adams? (Somebody, PLEASE tell me the real Patch didn't do this in this thing we refer to as ""real life"".)Another thing that seems somewhat phony: Patch's age as he decides to start his medical career.

This is a great movie by good director tom shadyac and includes a great cast including williams and philip seymour hoffman as patch's friend mitch.Williams stars as patch adams a guy who comes to work for a hospital with several patients who are either very ill or whose doctors have done little to improve their condition. adams though, knows that the way to improve their patients is not through medicine but through goodness and happiness. in adams case, he brings laughter and joy using an unusual brand of humor.In several instances, adams dresses and acts like a clown complete with a red nose. He entertains the dying patients in the hospital with his gentle heart and breathes new life and hope into them.''You treat a disease,  you win or lose, you treat a patient,  i'll guarantee you ll win'' that great lines is Adams philosophy toward treating patients.He sees that one of the main reasons the doctors have failed in improving their patients conditions is because several of the doctors are cold-blooded and unfeeling. The doctors fail to get know their patients intimately and fail most of all to make their patients happy. several of william's colleagues a guy named mitch and a girl name annie are skeptical at first, but after witnessing the improvement in the patients, they see that adams is just what the doctor ordered.However, not all the people in the hospital is happy with adams. The main boss of the hospital (obviously jealous with adams amazing ability to relate and bring joy the patients) wants adams to quit or be fired from the hospital. i liked this movie very much not only because of williams performance but because of the message. in today's age with greedy HMO's, high medical costs and unfeeling customers service, todays patients don't really get the high quality medical care. Many doctors are rude and impatient with the patients, Nurses fail to get there patients personally and so forth.Of course not all Doctors and Hospitals are cold-blooded are bad, but it would stupid to say that all of them are good, because they are not. If you turn on the news, there's always a news segment chronicle the bad service of a hospital or doctor, or a lawsuit against both.So the movie is very fact based. It's actually based on the 1970's real life events of  Hunter ''Patch'' Adams (Robin Williams), who founded the Gesundheit Clinic.Williams does his usual great heartwarming , comedic performance that only he can do.

65506,A1Y8IUMN7TBKS,0783234996,Groovy Vegan,"[35, 41]","Robin Williams' portrayal of Dr. Patch Adams' medical school adventures was both entertaining and inspiring.  Although Williams' comic genius shined through in his physical humor of clowning around (e.g. entertaining sick children by dancing with bedpans on his feet, an enema bulb on his nose and an IV stand as a dance partner) as well as quick verbal banter, the comedy is only part of Williams' acting repertoire and movie's appeal.  Having seen Robin Williams mostly in interviews where he seemed to be spending every second trying to be funny, I was amazed at his ability to not only be serious, but to convincingly portray a spectrum of non-comic emotions/conditions:  shock, grief, guilt, frustration, anger.  All was not fun and games in the medical school education of Patch Adams, as he dealt with personal issues, personality clashes and the difficulties of trying change the institution of medicine without getting thrown out of medical school.  I also enjoyed the work of the supporting cast of fellow medical students, instructors, administrators, nurses and patients.  One especially amusing character was Patch Adams' pompous, roommate Mitch, played with a straight face by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Seeing Adams' effect on the people he knew over time was enjoyable and heartwarming, yet realistic:  some warmed up immediately, some over time, and a few, unfortunately, not at all.But what makes this movie 5 stars is that combined with the good acting and entertainment value, many life's lessons are portrayed.  Here are just a few of many.  The value of:* treating patients (and all people) as individuals with feelings, dreams, interests and talents to improve their quality of life, regardless of whether one can cure a disease.* patience, kindness, persistence, humor and imagination in dealing with personality conflict.* having a dream, believing in yourself, and selling that vision to others who can help you manifest it.* having the persistence to deal with obstacles that get in the way of manifesting one's dream.* having the courage to speak and act out against injustice, even at considerable personal risk.It's well worth watching this movie to gain wisdom from Patch Adams' life while being entertained by Robin Williams and a host of fine actors.

It was heartfelt, loving... maybe not &quot;real&quot;, but are any of Robin Williams's movies &quot;real&quot;? Take Dead Poets Society, for instance. What teacher would ever do the things that RW's Mr. Keating did, all to teach his students poetry? Or in Mrs. Doubtfire. Who on earth would dress up as a female nanny to see his kids when he could always apply for custody (I can't remember if he tried that or not in the movie)? The point is that Robin likes to play characters who are unconventional, who defy all rule and logic just to express themselves and to live their lives the way they want it to be lived. And for that, Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors. He gives Hollywood a touch of humorous life, creating almost a picture with his actions. He challenges us to be who we are, no matter what the common person may say. I am sick and tired of hearing people say that Robin's career is on a downslide and will defend him anytime someone has a doubt. OK, now that I'm done venting my anger... Patch Adams is a fantastic movie. See it if you want to laugh, cry, and just enjoy yourself and be inspired. (See Dead Poets Society if you REALLY want to be inspired). Enjoy.

65513,A3H4IJ9QONM0JK,0783234996,"James Cho ""whopper170""","[26, 56]","The central message and theme of this movie is true...Doctors should care about their patients, but the movie chooses to attack many practices and  institutions in the medical profession that are there for good reasons, or  are not within the individual doctor's individual ability to fix such as the  HMO/insurance problem.  It is a fundamental dogma of western medicine for  a doctor to never supercede a patient's wish to privacy, something that  Patch decides to ignore.  While in the case of the movie, it works for the  audience, in real life a doctor legally, ethically and morally should never ever have that right.  Other problems I had with the movie  1) Patch  suprisingly scares a patient on intensive care (he could've killed the  patient)  2) Patch steals medical supplies from a hospital  3)Patch's  girlfriend dies because Patch chose to ignore some medical practices which  he and the movie scorns such as background checks and patient histories  4) There are many recorded cases of Doctors becoming emotionally close to  their patients => in many cases violating a patient's peace of mind  should the relationship go awry.  This is an issue the movie chooses to  ignore.  5) Patch greets a medical conference with 2 giant ladies legs  leading to large double doors in the center of them.  While this maybe  funny @ a fraternity party, it isn't appropriate for a team of  gynecologists.  I mean seriously, if you had a gynecological disorder and your doc did something like that, you're either going to get the joke & be able to laugh or not get it & be very very mad.  You think docs should be doing things that are going to get 50% of their patients mad at them?  6) Patch, in  an attempt to garner humor makes fun of a schizophrenic patient who's arm  is pointing upwards.  This ridicule could actually deepen the patient's  schizophrenic withdrawal from reality, but for the audience that doesn't understand this, oh wow, that's real funny man.  While this movie garnered many  laughs and warm emotions from most of the audience who does not understand  the institution, as a medical student and hopeful future doctor, I wish it  took a more serious and open minded view on the practices it chose to  attack.

Adams wanted to help people, and to do, so he tried to re-align the way doctors see their role with patients.  Rather than maintaining a distance between doctor and patient, Adams felt that doctors should be more compassionate and understanding.  At the time, this was a revolutionary idea.  His dream, from what I read, is still in the process of becoming a reality.Robin Williams, playing Adams, gives a lot of life to this role.  As in other roles, Williams doesn't keep to the comic side of the role but explores the other extreme as well.  We can see and feel his pain.  Williams is very good at taking us through the whole spectrum of emotion.A problem I have with the movie is some elements are too similar to other movies Williams has done.  For instance, if you remember the scene in ""Dead Poets Society"" where all the students are showing their support, then you have seen a version of this movie.

The scene where the little children with cancer all arrive in the courtroom wearing rubber clown noses to support Patch in his hour of need is one of the most unexpected and deeply moving things you will ever see. If you don't cry at that moment, you must not be human.I think everybody should be more like Patch. At the auto garage where I work I've used some of Patch's techniques to liven up the atmosphere-- putting an oil funnel on top of my head, wearing a fake mustache and funny eyeglasses, cracking lots of jokes.

65555,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,0783234996,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[2, 5]","With a natural aptitude for medicine, &quot;Patch&quot; Adams need not struggle through medical school as his classmates do, and the aloof doctor-to-be is free to devote much of his time to making terminal patients feel better, much to the dismay of the teachers and administrators of his otherwise idyllic medical school.  In other words, it's Robin Williams doing &quot;Good Morning Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; and &quot;Toys&quot; in med school, with stuffy and stolid doctors standing in for the stuffy latin teachers of &quot;Poets&quot; and the stiff military types in &quot;Toys&quot; and &quot;Good Morning&quot;.  Bob Cousins, who must be a pretty good humored guy to have spent the 90's playing the unsympathetic authority figure, plays Adams' nemesis, the mean Medical School teacher who is determined to either oust Adams or turn him into a carbon copy of himself.  Adams' classmates verge towards the craven, with most openly envious of higher grades.Somehow getting support from some students, Patch opens up a clinic and manages to fall in love with an otherwise frigid classmate who first rebuffs him.  But tragedy strikes and (ala' &quot;Poets&quot; and &quot;Vietnam&quot;) it takes the combined strength of all of his colleagues to convince him not to give up.  The movie climaxes with a medical review board in which Adams must defend his unorthodox ways, but somehow comes out on top, complete with a rousing applause, and a message about how doctors must be more human.  It's pretty stiff hollywood morality instead, considering how the film seems more packaged than created.

65563,A2VP7JOT3K7PFM,0783234996,"Stephen Pletko ""Uncle Stevie""","[33, 34]","+++++This movie is based on the book ""Gesundheit: Good Health is a Laughing Matter"" by Hunter Doherty Adams with Maureen Mylander.Mike Farrell of ""M*A*S*H"" fame was one of the producers of this movie.This movie is also based on the true story of Hunter ""Patch"" Adams.At the movie's beginning we are taken to the psychiatric ward of a hospital in 1969.  We discover here how Hunter Adams (Robin Williams) gets his unique nickname of ""Patch"" and why he decides to become a medical doctor.Two years later he goes to medical school where he encounters, among other things, a snobby roommate named Mitch (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a very traditional medical school dean (Bob Gunton), meets a fellow medical student named Truman (Daniel London) who becomes his good friend, and as well meets a stand-offish female medical student Corinne (Monica Potter) who eventually sees his point of view with respect to medicine.Patch's antics at the hospital where he learns to become a doctor are hilarious.  (These antics almost get him kicked out of medical school.)  But there is a method to his madness as he wants to humanize medicine.  His underlying philosophy is:""A doctor's mission should be not just to prevent death but also to improve the quality of life [of patients].""He eventually has a brainstorm of building a free clinic called the ""Gesundheit Institute"" and to get started he starts a free clinic while still attending medical school.A tragedy occurs but Patch is able to overcome it.The movie ends by giving the viewer the following information:""During the next twelve years, Patch Adams opened a home-based family medical practice and treated more than 15,000 people without payment, malpractice insurance, or formal facilities...construction of the Gesundheit Hospital is currently underway.  To date [1998], a waiting list of over 1000 physicians have offered to leave their current practice and join Patch's cause.""All the acting is good but Robin Williams as Patch gives an interesting performance.  Even though he delivers sidesplitting humor, I felt that it wasn't over-the-top and is balanced quite well with the inspiring, dramatic, and true story.  I was also surprised by Daniel London's excellent performance as Truman, Patch's sidekick.  Monica Potter's Corinne character is somewhat one-dimensional but she makes the best of it.  Philip S. Hoffman also does a good job as the serious medical student named Mitch.I also enjoyed the background music.  It adds to each scene of the movie.Some people (including Roger Ebert) don't seem to like this movie.  However, according to Amazon's ""Theatrical Release Information"" (see above), this movie whose budget estimate was $50 million has taken in $194 million worldwide garnering a profit of almost $145 million.  So the big question is, ""Why don't some people not like this movie.""  The main reason, I think, is that (believe-it-or-not) some people are satisfied with the traditional medical system as it is today and don't like anything (such as this movie) that criticizes it.  Thus, I would not recommend this movie to such traditionalists.Finally, the DVD (collector's edition) has excellent picture and sound quality.  There are a few extras, all of them interesting.In conclusion, this is an inspiring movie based on a true story that effectively displays Robin Williams' comic and dramatic talents.

65568,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,0783234996,Thomas Glebe,"[1, 1]","Positive or negative audience ""hype"" and critical praise or thumbs down have rarely had much of an effect on me.  Audiences can often get it all wrong in my view, or all right, and so it goes as well for ""professional"" movie reviewers.  Most of the latter got this one all wrong in blasting it as most have.  To me however, while certainly with flaws, this movie aims straight for the heart, and gets things right more often than not.  It is both a drama and a comedy, and while there are some rather jarring cuts between the two, in the end, this film's heart (and socio-political statement) is certainly in the right spot throughout.  And more true today (unfortunately) than when it was first released or realized and lived out by the real life person upon which this is all based, ""Patch Adams.""The fantastic opening scene and voice-over narrative by Robin Williams, accompanied by simple piano music (which swells to orchestral), introduces us to Patch (as he would later be called), a sad, depressed, self-pitying, aging young man on his way to nowhere, and to the ""nut house"" after a failed suicide attempt.  He ""self-admits"" himself to a hospital psycho ward, after having tried almost every remedy and ""prescription drug"" (evidenced in his bathroom medicine chest), given him by the established medical ""industry.""  What he finds there, and later, and what he discovers about himself and others, remains a searing indictment of that ""industry"" and what is and is not considered ""normal.""  Institution-wise...Those institutions are truly a daily, functioning contradiction.  On the one hand, hospitals and doctors have as their guiding principle (or so they say), the noblest of goals.  To treat people in need, to care for the sick and for those without the means to care for themselves, and to acknowledge that we are all basically just human beings living out our lives together in a ""society"" where the ""Golden Rule"" is actually the only one which matters.  But who, if they've been run through the impersonal, profit-oriented HMO horror that is the state of today's ""medical care,"" who, if they've ever spent any amount of time ""in the hospital,"" or fighting with cold, impersonal ""health insurance"" agencies and agents and unreasonable costs, would agree with the notion that ""altruistic"" and ""loving"" personal care shouldn't play a large part in any truly civilized health care ""system?""Only but the most cold-hearted cynic about life and the sanctity of that, and those who consider the medical profession as just another ""business,"" could deny that increasing the ""personalizing"" of the doctor-patient relationship, could do anything but positive things.  Old habits and customs, old traditions and ways of thinking die hard however.  Is and was the ""philosophy"" of Dr. Hunter ""Patch"" Adams really all that bizarre or unworkable?  Or is and was it an attempt to just return to the ""good old days"" when a doctor would actually get his/her butt over to your house and tend to your sick child or you or a loved one, because they gave a damn?  Or ""take your call.""  Or fight against the medical corporate interests that inhibit the very practice and art of medicine and healing itself?  Because it was (and should supposedly remain) their very oath to do so?In an early part of the film, a psychiatrist who is supposed to be ""helping"" Patch and at the very least, ""listening"" to him, fiddles around with his coffee, avoids eye contact, and eventually doesn't even hear what Patch says.  A bit later, Patch opts to dismiss himself from the institution, for the obvious reason that he's just not getting any true medical help there.  The psychiatrist, ego puffed up, tells Patch that he disagrees with the early release, and that after all, ""he"" is the doctor.  In a wonderful, fleeting, but finely powerful moment, Patch replies, ""Yeah, but you suck at it.""  Patch says he thinks he can do better, and at a much later than normal age, applies to and is accepted into a prestigious medical school, and goes about proving that the personal touch is the most sound one a doctor can give to their patients.  He does so with humor, and various more touching serious moments, but is fought every step along the way by the university and medical ""establishment.""  Patch's attempts to fight along the way, and his romantic interests and encouragements, disappointments, and eventual realizations, make up the bulk of the film.  And this real life story is nothing but an inspiration, especially to those who just know in their hearts that there is something dreadfully wrong with the American health care ""industry, but that there just may be hope, if doctors were only to reach the awareness and enlightenment about the doctor-patient relationship that Patch did.  As both a patient and a doctor.While there are many missteps along the way, particularly in the often too-strident aspects of switching from drama to comedy, as well as turning from a personal story along the way into more of a broader, more philosophical and political denunciation of the university-trained and health-care ""commerce"" without needed cinematic transitional techniques, most of this works beautifully, and touchingly.The film reminded me of many of my favorite movies of the past along the general ""theme"" celebrating the wisdom and morality of the common, caring individual caught up in a crazy world, including ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" and  ""The Grapes of Wrath.""  While admittedly over the top and bordering on pretentious at times, ""Patch Adams"" remains one of my favorite films of all time, despite drawbacks.  I think this movie should be required viewing for medical school students, who may not, like the critics, ""get it.""  In addition, they should all have to watch it again and again until they do.

65573,AP3B615GM191G,0783234996,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","There are some true-life tales that go beyond the standard fare to uplift and inspire viewers.  The story of Hunter ""Patch"" Adams, despite a bit of contrived theatrics, is exactly that sort of film.For a basic plot summary, this moive tells the story of Mr. Adams, beginning with his time in a mental institution for suicidal thoughts.  However, after a life-changing experience in that facility, Patch decides to devote his life to helping people, choosing medicine as his vehicle.  The rest of the film focuses on Patch's time in medical school, including his ""unorthodox"" (treat the patient, not the disease) approach that bucks the standard, as well as the free medical clinic he starts out of his own home after being sickened by the medical bureaucracy.Whichever way you shake it, the Patch Adams story is one of hope and inspiration.  At times, director Tom Shadyac goes a bit too over-the-top for my tastes, but for some it will help to hammer home the point.In terms of casting, it is Robin Williams' movie to carry, and he does so admirably with his unique brand of humor and character.  Some of the other casting decisions (like Philip Seymour Hoffman as a med. student) were a bit sketchy, but Williams steals the show from the opening act.Thus, I would recommend this movie to all but the most hardened cynics (who might not appreciate some of the theatrics).  It will make you laugh, cry, and cheer in equal proportions.",4,An Uplifting Tale Of The Human Spirit,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",2010,1434,"['are', 'true-life', 'tales', 'go', 'standard', 'fare', 'uplift', 'inspire', 'viewers', 'story', 'Hunter', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'bit', 'contrived', 'theatrics', 'exactly', 'sort', 'film.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'moive', 'story', 'Mr.', 'Adams', 'beginning', 'time', 'mental', 'institution', 'suicidal', 'thoughts', 'However', 'life-changing', 'experience', 'facility', 'Patch', 'devote', 'life', 'helping', 'people', 'choosing', 'medicine', 'vehicle', 'rest', 'film', 'Patch', 'time', 'medical', 'school', 'including', 'unorthodox', 'treat', 'patient', 'not', 'disease', 'approach', 'standard', 'as', 'well', 'free', 'medical', 'clinic', 'own', 'home', 'being', 'sickened', 'medical', 'bureaucracy.Whichever', 'way', 'shake', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'story', 'one', 'hope', 'inspiration', 'times', 'director', 'Tom', 'Shadyac', 'bit', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'tastes', 'will', 'help', 'hammer', 'home', 'point.In', 'terms', 'casting', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'movie', 'carry', 'so', 'admirably', 'unique', 'brand', 'humor', 'character', 'other', 'casting', 'decisions', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'med', 'student', 'were', 'bit', 'sketchy', 'Williams', 'show', 'opening', 'act.Thus', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'most', 'hardened', 'cynics', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'appreciate', 'theatrics', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'cry', 'cheer', 'equal', 'proportions']",N/A
