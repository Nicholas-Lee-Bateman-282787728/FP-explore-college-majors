665350,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005MEV2,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","David Spade is one of those actors who I find genuinely hysterical.  There is just something about his shtick that really makes me chuckle, a lot.  Even when his films are ridiculously stupid, I can't help but feel that he elevates them to this other level of entertaining.  That same rationale can be applied to `Joe Dirt', a film that really has no grounds to stake a claim at `funny' and yet, it really is.  It is as predictable and manipulative as these `dumb comedies' come and yet, there is always Spade to make it all go down smoother.  Spade plays Joe Dirt, a hillbilly simpleton in search of his parents.  Being abandoned at the Grand Canyon in his youth weighed heavy on him, and so Joe recalls his adventures in a way that should make us walk away, but it doesn't.  YES, this film could have been much better, but much better is not what you expect when David Spade dons a mullet and pronounces his name `Dear-tay'.  What you expect is a shamelessly predictable gross-out comedy that will make you laugh out loud.  In that respect, `Joe Dirt' works.

665354,AK2AQIULQDFS5,B00005MEV2,Bradley Tobin,"[14, 17]","The Story of Joe Dirt is a Story that Deserves to be told, it's Funny, Uplifting and... Nice, which was a Change from the Vile, Mean, Gross out comedy I went in Expecting (and of course... Wanted to see). Sure, it has moments of Ingenious Gross out comedy, but At it's Core, and for most of it's Running time, it has a lot of Heart. David Spade's Leap to Big Screen Leading man is a Successful one, like the films producer Adam Sandler, and their Mutual Friend Rob Schneider, Spade is the Underdog with a Heart of Gold and I for one couldn't Wait to see him come out On Top.Spade is (you guessed it) Joe Dirt, a Mullet-wearing Loser whose life has been Fraught with Failure and Overcome by Opposition, well Not Quite overcome, as Dirt is an Undying Optimist. He is brought onto a Radio show one day by a Satirical DJ (Dennis Miller) to be the Butt of all the Jokes, but as his story unfolds, the DJ, the Listeners, the Entire Country get caught up in his story and he becomes a National Hero.The film is Always Amusing, Sometimes Hysterical one. It features a Wonderful Supporting cast that, no matter How much screen time they get, they Give they're all. Dennis Miller is Naturally a Hilarious man, he is also one of the most Underrated comedians in America, I just Love the guy, he can do no wrong. Brittany Daniels is Sugary Sweet and Boundlessly Beautiful as Joe's Sweetheart. Jaime Pressly is Endlessly Sexy and Fiendishly Funny as a Strange Acquaintance of Joe's. Brittany and Jaime are both Unbelievable Beautiful actresses and they also prove themselves to be Quite Talented Comediennes.Christopher Walken gives a cameo that threatens to Steal the film out from under Joe's feet, he is a Brilliant performer and I Await the day when he takes on a Full-Blown Lead role in a Comedy. It could Happen, don't Poo-poo the idea straight away, just think about it. Rosanna Arquette gives an Amusing performance as well, the one performance in the film that Stands out as Genuinely Bad is Kid Rock's performance. This man is Not an Actor, he is bad, there is no other way of putting it. He looks Very uncomfortable in front of the camera when he is Supposed to be playing a Bully Character. ""Joe Dirt"" features a Lot of other known faces and Good performances, but to list them all would Bore you and Annoy me, but I will anyway. Fred Ward, Adam Beach and Joe Don Baker. That wasn't so bad.Overall, it is a Pleasing ""Forest Gump""-ish tale of Overcoming Adversity, Accepting Yourself and your Situation and making the audience laugh. I went in thinking it would be a Silly Gross out comedy and I came out Shocked because I'd just seen a Good Film, with a Good Story. Man, I didn't see that coming at all.Oh, one last thing.

That is not entirely bad, but the story falls flat later on in the movie because it has no more supporting material. Other than that, the performances aren't that impressive; yeah, their not supposed to be because it's the enjoyment and the comedy that matters, but it would be nice to see some great performances reminiscent of maybe Peter Sellers in a modern movie.

The reason is quite simple: It boils down to the ""if you can't understand it, it must be deep"" maxim by which directors hawk erstwhile incomprehensible fare as somehow profound.Actually, I rate ""Joe Dirt"" a bit higher than ""Lost in Translation,"" giving the latter three stars. I actually enjoyed Sofia Coppola's movie, but found the cinematography a bit wanting.However, ""Joe Dirt"" has been slammed as a formulaic comedy. Indeed, that it is. However, the producers of this flick never make any intimations that this movie was anything other than what it was. Unlike ""American Beauty,"" a compilation of suburban cliches and stale anti-bourgeoise gripes, ""Joe Dirt"" doesn't pretend it's the latest profundity emanating from the Dalai Lama.And, what it is is good fun, some gross gags and a somewhat autobiographical story for David Spade. It's about dirty Joe Dirt, an abandoned orphan now grown up and living in the broom closet of a classic rock radio station. He's discovered by shock jock Zander Kelly (played by the ever droll Dennis Miller), who exploits Joe's life story for the entertainment of his radio audience.Like so many movies of its kind, it uses the road trip analogy borrowed by so many comedies ever since Homer's ""Odyssey."" Joe -- who was abandoned as a child at Grand Canyon  -- is searching for the parents who mislaid him so many year before. Along the way we meet tough guys that bully Joe (Joe Don Baker and Kid Rock), a real hot country gal (Brittany Daniel), an ex-mafioso hiding out as a janitor in a witness protection program (Christopher Walken, as suave as ever) and an American Indian shilling fireworks (Adam Beach).""Joe Dirt"" has a good number of sight gags and lots of literal toilet humor, involving crap meteorites and a-bomb RV toilet tanks (""I got the poo on me!"" Joe cries, covered in dung). Walken has the movie's best line: ""It's your tone, it's all wrong. Do it again, and I'll stab you in the face with a soldering iron."") There's even a hilarious send-up of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in which transvestite Buffalo Bob (Brian Thompson) imprisons Joe in a hole in the floor.Best of all, Joe's life is set to a great soundtrack of classic rock songs from the late 1970s and early 80s by great bands such as Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Doobie Brothers, Bachman-Turner-Overdrive, April Wine, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and Cheap Trick.No, ""Joe Dirt"" is not nearly as profound as ""Citizen Kane"" nor as funny as ""Young Frankenstein,"" but it's a solid film, and lots of fun, if you don't take a silly film as this seriously.",4,Underrated.

665377,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00005MEV2,Jason,"[0, 0]","Joe Dirt is the gut-bustingly funny tale of a character by the same name, payed by David Spade.  He's a complete loser working as a janitor when he gets spotted and highlighted by a radio host (Dennis Miller) named Xander Kelly.  The show gives us the privilege of hearing about Joe's life, and the hilarity ensues.First and foremost, Joe is pathetic looking.  He has a surgically attached mullet, porkchop sideburns, and facial hair that looks like the results of bad inbreeding.  What's more, he is absolutely clueless about how stupid he looks.  He's so worthless, in fact, that his parents abandoned him at the Grand Canyon, and it's this abandonment that begins his amazing journey.Soon enough, we come to see Joe Dirt as not so pathetic, and we begin to empathize with him.  He's just an honest guy, looking for his family and love, but just happens to look horrible.There are far too many hilarious scenes to mention, but a few noteworthy ones are when he meets an Indian named Kicking Wing who owns a fireworks stand in the desert.  In a matter of no time, the two are shooting fireworks into fuel, and causing massive explosions.  The next thing you know, Joe Dirt is getting septic tanks dumped on his head, dog's ballls are getting frozen to winter porches, and beatdowns occur at oil derricks.

Brittman ""The Bottom Line""","[8, 16]","I always respected David Spade as a sly and witty comedian, that is until I found out that he wrote the script to Joe Dirt.  I can basically sum up this movie in one word: unwatchable.  Joe Dirt plays like Pee-Wee's Big Adventure only the characters aren't 1/10th as interesting or funny.  Joe Dirt is an adventure that takes our mullet haired, skynyrd listening, AC/DC T-Shirt wearing friend on a quest to find the parents who deserted him 10 years ago.  The series and sequence of events of the film are a collage of thrown together vignettes that simply just don't work, on ANY level.  In fact, the funniest moments in Joe Dirt are seeing the writing on the t-shirts that he is wearing (the funniest being I Choked Linda Lovelace).  There are some moderately big stars in Joe Dirt like Christopher Walken, Dennis Miller, and Rosanna Arquette; all I can say is that they must have owed Spade a favor.  David Spade is at his best when his dead-pan sarcasm is allowed to shine through.  In this film, Joe Dirt is not sarcastic rather Spade tries to pull him off as a lovable backwoods kid.  He is totally unbelievable in this part because he is the true opposite of everything that Joe Dirt is, and the public knows it.

This silly comedy gives you a fun story that you'd expect from guys like Sandler and Spade, but with this goofy, feel-good storyline.  Spade plays ""Joe Dirt,"" a dim-witted, overly positive redneck who tells his story of searching for his lost parents to Dennis Miller, who plays one of those annoying morning DJ-types.  All along his journey, he ends up meeting odd characters and winds up in outrageous situations like Hanks' ""Gump.""  As the film progresses, Los Angeles(where the radio station is located) becomes captivated by the simpleton's plight and he becomes a local hero.As with any film starring Spade, this movie has some very silly situations, but you can't help but laugh at them no matter how stupid they are.  This is one of those movies that falls under the category of ""guilty pleasure.""One glaring omission from this film is Chris Farley, who, if alive, would have definitely been in this film.  Without Farley, however, Spade does a solid job and gives the viewer what to expect:  sophomoric comedy.One note:  ""Dirt"" is from Louisiana, so was the ""Waterboy.""

If you try to hard to hate it, or laugh at everything, or become too involved in the storyline, than you won't enjoy it.Joe Dirt is a movie that profiles a pathetic country kid on a mission to find his long-lost parents.This may sound like a cheesy plot, and if I'm honest, it is. But there are some funny jokes, and you have to laugh at Dennis Miller, who plays a stuck up DJ on an LA radio station, as he judges and critises Dirt about the sorry life he leads.The shining lights in this film are David Spade, who plays Joe, and Clem, the janitor/ex-mobster, who he ends up working with. Spade is very funny, and if you like him as Finch in Just Shoot Me, then Joe Dirt is worth a look.Perhaps the best part of the DVD is David Spade's audio commentary. In this he talks of the amount of times he had to beg producers to keep scenes in, and how he loves when someone says this or does that. His witty one-liners and unique laugh only help improve this film.Watch the movie, then listen to Spade's commentary, and the short but entertaining blooper reel, and after all this decide whether or not Joe Dirt is a good movie or not.Don't buy this DVD if you are after the best comedy ever, or an original and quality plot, but if you want some quick laughs and aren't too quick to pass judgement, then Joe Dirt might be right for you.",3,Worth a watch for Spade fans...,1055030400,"06 8, 2003",2003,1422,"['When', 'sit', 'down', 'watch', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'have', 'ideas', 'head', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'try', 'hard', 'hate', 'laugh', 'everything', 'become', 'too', 'involved', 'storyline', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'it.Joe', 'Dirt', 'movie', 'pathetic', 'country', 'kid', 'mission', 'find', 'long-lost', 'parents.This', 'may', 'sound', 'cheesy', 'plot', ""'m"", 'honest', 'are', 'funny', 'jokes', 'have', 'laugh', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'who', 'stuck', 'up', 'DJ', 'LA', 'radio', 'station', 'judges', 'critises', 'Dirt', 'sorry', 'life', 'shining', 'lights', 'film', 'are', 'David', 'Spade', 'who', 'Joe', 'Clem', 'janitor/ex-mobster', 'who', 'up', 'working', 'Spade', 'very', 'funny', 'like', 'Finch', 'Just', 'Shoot', 'Me', 'then', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'look.Perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'DVD', 'David', 'Spade', 'audio', 'commentary', 'amount', 'times', 'had', 'beg', 'producers', 'keep', 'scenes', 'how', 'when', 'someone', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'unique', 'laugh', 'only', 'help', 'improve', 'film.Watch', 'movie', 'then', 'Spade', 'commentary', 'short', 'entertaining', 'blooper', 'reel', 'decide', 'not', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'good', 'movie', 'not.Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'DVD', 'are', 'best', 'comedy', 'ever', 'original', 'quality', 'plot', 'want', 'quick', 'laughs', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'quick', 'pass', 'judgement', 'then', 'Joe', 'Dirt', 'might', 'be', 'right']",Joe Dirt
665424,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005MEV2,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[0, 0]","JOE DIRT is often crude, is rather poorly edited, yet is somewhat enjoyable. David Spade plays Joe Dirt, a white trailer trash kid who was separated from his parents on a trip to the Grand Canyon. Left on his own, Joe begins a life of nomadic existence before being forced into foster care. Later, he runs away beginning his wandering life again in a quest to find his parents. He travels all around the country, working at a host of jobs from carnie worker, alligator wrangler, walking tooth, oil worker, and a janitor to name just a few. Eventually, Joe ends up in L.A. and his story is told on a misanthropic, sarcastic radio program and Joe becomes a national celebrity.JOE DIRT is rather crude and risque several times. I mean, the movie tries to make a joke out of a dog having it's testicles frozen to the floor of a front porch. However, this is an Adam Sandler produced picture so that should be expected. David Spade is sometimes funny as Joe Dirt, but more often than not he's just pathetic. Spade is great when it comes to witty, sarcastic humor; but when left to physical or situational comedy, Spade isn't that funny. The movie jumps around a lot and would have probably worked better if a lot of the radio station stuff (and Dennis Miller) was cut out and had the story told in a more coherent chronological order without the choppiness. Nevertheless, the film does have it's moments and is surprisingly funny.Overall, a rude and crude film that lacks originality and imagination, but has some humorous moments.
