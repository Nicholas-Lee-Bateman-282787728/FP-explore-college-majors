I have in my Dvd collection already at least 3-4 based on the Indiginous American Red Indian and how they as were other Indiginious peoples such as the Aboriginal in Australia. The Indiginous New Zealanders, The South African so on and so on have been treated with complete disrespect by White man. That is British and European white people who for some reason truly believe simply they are superior to anyone with darker skin. This belief i find to be astounding as it is ridiculous. The Indiginous peoples of the planet truly cared for the Earth, the fauna the animals etc etc. There was no greed in their societies and as with the Red Indian the Indiginous were wise and treat their elders with the respect they deserve. This often times does not happen with white man and their offspring. The word CARE is not in their vocabulary, care for others, care for our planet and the envirenment. What the English did to the black Aricans by kidnapping peoples and turning them into slaves with no conscience makes this DVD one that all Nations peoples should watch. Here in Australia i have a great amount of respect for many Indiginous peoples i know well and even though i am from European descent i feel i understand and comprehend the wrongs done to Indiginous peoples. Their land was stolen and taken without any thought or compunction. The arrogance of some whites is incomprehensible to me. Any activists such Dr. Martin Luther King Jnr/ even Robert Kennedy. John Lennon who wrote the most imoportant composition of music of all time was IMAGINE, the Indiginous were nullified. White humans require i believe now need to take a good look at themselves and the society we have built but htis will never happen. I am praying that the US and Allies do not intervene in Syria where the Drews, Muslims and Catholics have lived quietly and peacefully together for hundreds of years. I am concerned that certain nations require their soldiers to be at war constantly. They kill their youth in their prime. i would say ""please do not start WW3"". The Middle East is in crisis amd we need to allow them to sort out their politics without our intervention. Slavery was and is Iniquitous/evil. Nelson Mandella is a great man, like Gandhi he managed to capture respect by being who he is and he is a better man than billions of White men. His passing will be a watershed moment. We all need to respect all races/religions and customs and as is according to the US ""Every man is born equal"".LOL, I am looking forward to watching this most educational dvd which is the hard truth and no amount of propaganda can change that.
