Later such Western fare or western style shows like  The Wild Wild West, F Troop and The Big Valley (all reviewed by me) came later with mixed results from the 1950 glut of TVHowever, in 1959, Rawhide premered on TV. It was a trail blazer. A cattle drive across the  country with many adventures along the way. It also  introduced the world to the talents of Clint Eastwood. This is where Eastwood earned  his western chops for such future western fare as Unforgiven, Fistful of Dollars, Hang Em High and the classic the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.Th first season was shot is glorious black and white, anything before 1965 was rare for COLOR TV..Walt Disney was smart and did many of his shows in color (like Davy Crockett, Swamp Fox, Texas John Slaughter), but most westerns in the late 1950 was just Black and whote. However what the show lacks in color hues, it makes up for in action and good drama. I dodnt know why we need to have our TV shows shows latent with RED blood from crime and hosptal shows , dirty sepia color for westerns rather than green grass and blue sky. The show didn't need  to seem so holy than thou--we knew the heroes and you could see the villians a mile away.Maybe because these show were from 1959, some of the edge of seen it before has taken root. BUT in the show's defense, it was great adventure-high television. It wasn't art, just a good show a family can watch  TOHETHER and it still is!There are NO EXTRAS, one would wish Eastwood would reflect on his western beginning and do an audio commentary-but NO LUCK..maybe another volume!Now is the easy part,  would I recomend it? IN A HEARTBEAT.

986189,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,B000F9T70K,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","Considering the prominence to which Clint Eastwood has risen as a star and director, it's not at all surprising that this series, which provided his breakout role (Texas trail hand Rowdy Yates), should have made it to DVD.  Marketing, of course, dictates that his role be emphasized, when in fact he was what used to be called the ""male ingenue"" or ""juvenile lead,"" a still-inexperienced young man with a weakness for pretty girls who's being taught the business by the man with whom he was co-equally billed, Eric Fleming as his not-always-sympathetic, tough-as-nails boss, Gil Favor.  Favor and Rowdy are the top hands on a long cattle drive from San Antonio to Sedalia, Mo., backed up by a crew that includes scout Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley), wiry flank rider Jim Quince (Steve Raines), powerful swing man Joe Scarlet (Rocky Shahan), and ""the man who can make or break a drive,"" the cantankerous wagon cook Wishbone (Paul Brinegar), assisted by his slow-witted ""louse,"" Mushy (James Murdock), who says of himself that ""Thinkin's one thing I fight against.""  As they make their way northward over the endless plains of Texas (the season ends without their reaching the Red River), they contend with weather, wolves, water shortages, outlaws, land-jealous farmers, and assorted human beings, good and bad, whom they encounter along the trail.Based upon an actual trail diary and produced by Charles Marquis Warren (who also directed several of the segments), this classic Western features guest appearances by many well-known names of the time, including John Larch, Mark (aka Peter Mark) Richman, Martin Balsam, Troy Donahue (as Rowdy's old Wartime buddy, Charles ""Buzz"" Travis), Martin Milner, Marguerite Chapman, Dan Duryea, Sally Forrest, Jay C. Flippen, Lon Chaney Jr., Marie Windsor, Brian Donlevy, June Lockhart, Martha Hyer, former child star Margaret O'Brien, Macdonald Carey, George Brent, John Ericsson, Mercedes McCambridge, James Westerfield, Don Dubbins, Jack Lord, Gloria Talbott, Gary Merrill, Robert Driscoll (who in boyhood voiced Disney'sPeter Pan (Special Edition), Leslie Nielsen, Kathleen Crowley, Victor Jory, Nina Foch, Gerald Mohr, Brian Keith, Phyllis Avery, Linda Cristal (later of ""The High Chaparral""), Rick Jason, and Noah Beery, Jr. (both as Mexicans), as well as William Schallert, James Drury (not yetThe Virginian - Complete First Season on 10 DVDs - Limited Edition Embossed Collector's Tin! Plus Bonus Interview DVD!, DeForest Kelley (ofStar Trek: The Original Series - Season One (Remastered Edition), Michael Pate, James Anderson (whom viewers ofTo Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)will recognize as Bob Ewell), John Pickard, R. G. Armstrong, Martin Landau, and Charles Gray, who in later seasons became a short-term regular.  (""Incident Below the Brazos,"" probably broadcast out of its proper order, introduces Robert Cabal as ""Hey Soos"" Patinas, the Mexican horse wrangler, who later was brought back as a regular.)  The background music is a high point, with certain motifs popping up regularly.  The picture quality is excellent, although I find that I have to boost the sound almost to the maximum to be able to hear properly (your TV, or player, may not require this).Apart from a certain amount of inaccuracy with regard to guns, this series doesn't seem to be quite as confused historically as many Westerns of its day, and is pretty consistent about its date, which is probably 1868 (shown on the grave marker of one drover killed in a stampede), although there are a couple of points at which this is called into question (in ""Incident of the Judas Trap"" Nolan says it's ""five years"" since the War, and ""Incident of the Dry Drive"" has young Jim Hoad just back from six years of schooling back East, which wasn't likely to have occurred during the conflict).  Tidbits about the major characters' pasts (especially those of Favor, Rowdy, and Pete) surface regularly, and there are frequent references to the recent war.  If you enjoy this series, try doing a google search for ""Rawhide fan fiction;"" you'll be surprised to find how many people still love it enough to write original pieces related to it.",4,"Head 'em up, move 'em out!",1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,4156,"['Considering', 'prominence', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'risen', 'star', 'director', 'not', 'surprising', 'series', 'provided', 'breakout', 'role', 'Texas', 'trail', 'hand', 'Rowdy', 'Yates', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'DVD', 'Marketing', 'course', 'role', 'be', 'emphasized', 'when', 'fact', 'was', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'called', 'male', 'ingenue', 'juvenile', 'lead', 'still-inexperienced', 'young', 'man', 'weakness', 'pretty', 'girls', 'who', 'being', 'taught', 'business', 'man', 'whom', 'was', 'co-equally', 'billed', 'Eric', 'Fleming', 'not-always-sympathetic', 'tough-as-nails', 'boss', 'Gil', 'Favor', 'Favor', 'Rowdy', 'are', 'top', 'hands', 'long', 'cattle', 'drive', 'San', 'Antonio', 'Sedalia', 'Mo.', 'backed', 'up', 'crew', 'Pete', 'Nolan', 'Sheb', 'Wooley', 'wiry', 'flank', 'rider', 'Jim', 'Quince', 'Steve', 'Raines', 'powerful', 'swing', 'man', 'Joe', 'Scarlet', 'Rocky', 'Shahan', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'make', 'break', 'drive', 'cantankerous', 'wagon', 'cook', 'Wishbone', 'Paul', 'Brinegar', 'assisted', 'slow-witted', 'louse', 'Mushy', 'James', 'Murdock', 'who', 'Thinkin', 'one', 'thing', 'fight', 'make', 'way', 'northward', 'endless', 'plains', 'Texas', 'season', 'reaching', 'Red', 'River', 'contend', 'weather', 'wolves', 'water', 'shortages', 'outlaws', 'land-jealous', 'farmers', 'assorted', 'human', 'beings', 'good', 'bad', 'whom', 'encounter', 'trail.Based', 'actual', 'trail', 'diary', 'produced', 'Charles', 'Marquis', 'Warren', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'several', 'segments', 'classic', 'Western', 'features', 'guest', 'appearances', 'many', 'well-known', 'names', 'time', 'including', 'John', 'Larch', 'Mark', 'aka', 'Peter', 'Mark', 'Richman', 'Martin', 'Balsam', 'Troy', 'Donahue', 'Rowdy', 'old', 'Wartime', 'buddy', 'Charles', 'Buzz', 'Travis', 'Martin', 'Milner', 'Marguerite', 'Chapman', 'Dan', 'Duryea', 'Sally', 'Forrest', 'Jay', 'C.', 'Flippen', 'Lon', 'Chaney', 'Jr.', 'Marie', 'Windsor', 'Brian', 'Donlevy', 'June', 'Lockhart', 'Martha', 'Hyer', 'former', 'child', 'star', 'Margaret', ""O'Brien"", 'Macdonald', 'Carey', 'George', 'Brent', 'John', 'Ericsson', 'Mercedes', 'McCambridge', 'James', 'Westerfield', 'Don', 'Dubbins', 'Jack', 'Lord', 'Gloria', 'Talbott', 'Gary', 'Merrill', 'Robert', 'Driscoll', 'who', 'boyhood', 'voiced', ""Disney'sPeter"", 'Pan', 'Special', 'Edition', 'Leslie', 'Nielsen', 'Kathleen', 'Crowley', 'Victor', 'Jory', 'Nina', 'Foch', 'Gerald', 'Mohr', 'Brian', 'Keith', 'Phyllis', 'Avery', 'Linda', 'Cristal', 'later', 'High', 'Chaparral', 'Rick', 'Jason', 'Noah', 'Beery', 'Jr.', 'Mexicans', 'as', 'well', 'William', 'Schallert', 'James', 'Drury', 'not', 'yetThe', 'Virginian', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', '10', 'DVDs', 'Limited', 'Edition', 'Embossed', 'Collector', 'Tin', 'Bonus', 'Interview', 'DVD', 'DeForest', 'Kelley', 'ofStar', 'Trek', 'Original', 'Series', 'Season', 'One', 'Remastered', 'Edition', 'Michael', 'Pate', 'James', 'Anderson', 'whom', 'viewers', 'ofTo', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'will', 'recognize', 'Bob', 'Ewell', 'John', 'Pickard', 'R.', 'G.', 'Armstrong', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Charles', 'Gray', 'who', 'later', 'seasons', 'became', 'short-term', 'regular', 'Incident', 'Brazos', 'probably', 'broadcast', 'proper', 'order', 'introduces', 'Robert', 'Cabal', 'Hey', 'Soos', 'Patinas', 'Mexican', 'horse', 'wrangler', 'who', 'later', 'was', 'brought', 'back', 'regular', 'background', 'music', 'high', 'point', 'certain', 'motifs', 'popping', 'up', 'regularly', 'picture', 'quality', 'excellent', 'find', 'have', 'boost', 'sound', 'almost', 'maximum', 'be', 'able', 'hear', 'properly', 'TV', 'player', 'may', 'not', 'require', '.Apart', 'certain', 'amount', 'inaccuracy', 'regard', 'guns', 'series', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'quite', 'confused', 'historically', 'many', 'Westerns', 'day', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'date', 'probably', '1868', 'shown', 'grave', 'marker', 'one', 'drover', 'killed', 'stampede', 'are', 'couple', 'points', 'called', 'question', 'Incident', 'Judas', 'Trap', 'Nolan', 'five', 'years', 'War', 'Incident', 'Dry', 'Drive', 'young', 'Jim', 'Hoad', 'just', 'back', 'six', 'years', 'schooling', 'back', 'East', 'was', ""n't"", 'likely', 'have', 'occurred', 'conflict', 'major', 'characters', 'pasts', 'especially', 'Favor', 'Rowdy', 'Pete', 'surface', 'regularly', 'are', 'frequent', 'references', 'recent', 'war', 'enjoy', 'series', 'try', 'doing', 'google', 'search', 'Rawhide', 'fan', 'fiction', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'still', 'love', 'enough', 'write', 'original', 'pieces', 'related']",Rawhide - The Complete First Season

Electronic televisions were the hi-tech of those days. And a generation was brought up watching the 'boob tube.' Much of the programming back then was comprised of westerns, much as Cop shows dominate present day.I can recall several westerns of that period, each of which I enjoyed.BonanzaPaladinMaverickBrandedWyatt EarpBat MastersonWanted Dead or AliveLaredoWagon TrainGunsmokeRawhideI enjoyed them all, but, I plunked my money down to buy only Maverick and Rawhide. Further, if you want a western that has the ring of truth, wherein the characters actually grow as the seasons pass, Rawhide is the hands-down choice. Rawhide was such a great original, as was Wagon Train, the Gene Roddenberry often was heard to say Star Trek was the Sci-Fi Wagon Train or Rawhide.Eric Fleming, in the role of Gil Favor was the ideal drover. He was born for this...just as James Garner was born for the role of Bret Maverick. The writing for his role was outstanding, but it was Fleming who brought those words to life in such a harmonized manner.Clint Eastwood, not a household name back then, was believable as a sometimes competent, sometimes flippant, drive ramrod (cowboy talk for foreman). Eastwood was at his best when he was a fish out of water.Paul Brinegar as Wishbone and James Murdoch provided light relief that prevented the show from being to dark and dreary. Sure, both roles tended towards slapstick cartoon characters, but the comic actions were welcome. Brinegar, I don't think, ever was able to escape his typecast, but I like to think he was okay with that.Sheb Wooley, a one hit wonder with The Purple People Eater, was a perfect fit for Pete Nolan. So was Steve Raines as Jim Quince.What I loved about Rawhide was that each character, portrayed by seemingly real people instead of actors, seemed like they actually could be driving a herd of 3,000 head of cattle to market.If you are wanting to understand how my generation, the Baby Boomers of America, you would find television westerns of TV's Golden Years a terrific resource.More important, if you like westerns, Rawhide - The Complete First Season is a must-buy.",5,"Season One of What Would Prove to be, Arguably, Television's Best Western Series",1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,2189,"['1950s', '1960s', 'were', 'time', 'change', 'America', 'Electronic', 'televisions', 'were', 'hi-tech', 'days', 'generation', 'was', 'brought', 'up', 'watching', ""'boob"", 'tube', 'Much', 'programming', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'comprised', 'westerns', 'much', 'Cop', 'dominate', 'present', 'day.I', 'can', 'recall', 'several', 'westerns', 'period', 'enjoyed.BonanzaPaladinMaverickBrandedWyatt', 'EarpBat', 'MastersonWanted', 'Dead', 'AliveLaredoWagon', 'TrainGunsmokeRawhideI', 'enjoyed', 'plunked', 'money', 'buy', 'only', 'Maverick', 'Rawhide', 'Further', 'want', 'western', 'ring', 'truth', 'wherein', 'characters', 'actually', 'grow', 'seasons', 'pass', 'Rawhide', 'hands-down', 'choice', 'Rawhide', 'was', 'such', 'great', 'original', 'was', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Gene', 'Roddenberry', 'often', 'was', 'heard', 'say', 'Star', 'Trek', 'was', 'Sci-Fi', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Rawhide.Eric', 'Fleming', 'role', 'Gil', 'Favor', 'was', 'ideal', 'drover', 'was', 'born', 'just', 'James', 'Garner', 'was', 'born', 'role', 'Bret', 'Maverick', 'writing', 'role', 'was', 'outstanding', 'was', 'Fleming', 'who', 'brought', 'words', 'life', 'such', 'harmonized', 'manner.Clint', 'Eastwood', 'not', 'household', 'name', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'believable', 'sometimes', 'competent', 'sometimes', 'flippant', 'drive', 'ramrod', 'cowboy', 'talk', 'foreman', 'Eastwood', 'was', 'best', 'when', 'was', 'fish', 'water.Paul', 'Brinegar', 'Wishbone', 'James', 'Murdoch', 'provided', 'light', 'relief', 'prevented', 'show', 'being', 'dark', 'dreary', 'Sure', 'roles', 'tended', 'towards', 'slapstick', 'cartoon', 'characters', 'comic', 'actions', 'were', 'welcome', 'Brinegar', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'ever', 'was', 'able', 'escape', 'typecast', 'like', 'think', 'was', 'okay', 'that.Sheb', 'Wooley', 'one', 'hit', 'wonder', 'Purple', 'People', 'Eater', 'was', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Pete', 'Nolan', 'So', 'was', 'Steve', 'Raines', 'Jim', 'Quince.What', 'loved', 'Rawhide', 'was', 'character', 'portrayed', 'seemingly', 'real', 'people', 'instead', 'actors', 'seemed', 'actually', 'could', 'be', 'driving', 'herd', '3,000', 'head', 'cattle', 'market.If', 'are', 'wanting', 'understand', 'how', 'generation', 'Baby', 'Boomers', 'America', 'would', 'find', 'television', 'westerns', 'TV', 'Golden', 'terrific', 'resource.More', 'important', 'like', 'westerns', 'Rawhide', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'must-buy']",Rawhide - The Complete First Season
986193,A3CX9ZSEFCDXX4,B000F9T70K,Daniel Hurley,"[41, 42]","As the producer says about the only just ""in town' episode, he got a lot of angry mail afterwards because people loved the great outdoor action of the drovers and their cattle as they constantly moved into the unknown territory of the Sedalia Trail. This great long running western adventurer had one of the best ensemble casts of all the westerns. Clint Eastwood, who became the popular star, played youthful beefcake, brave and quick tempered ramrod, balanced by Eric Fleming's hard nosed, mature and responsible trail boss. In addition, Paul Brineger plays the classic tough, short tempered and frequently criticized chuck wagon cook who runs the camp when the cattle stop moving and he is one of the many actors who add so much to this western. The supporting casts features two men that look and act like real drovers and not Hollywood cowboys, Steve Raines as Jim Quince and Rocky Shahan as Joe Scarelet. Rounding out the cast is the man in the middle, Sheb Wooley (High Noon) who plays Pete Nolan the experienced scout and expert on Indians. And there is even a touch of comedy relief played by James Murdock as Mushy, the cook's louse.  Robert Cabal as Hey Soos, the Ramuda wrangler, has a limited spot the first year. What was unique about Rawhide is that it had a real grimy touch of realism with a real cow herd,  a predominately outdoor set that looks like north Texas and it features great acting and dialogue such as ""You knew we were drovers by our look or are smell?"" This first year has a touch of naivety in some of the episodes but Eric Fleming's booming voice and his character always add the touch of reality. His motto is business first and avoid unnecessary entanglements but when they intersect trouble they tend to get involved. This first year has a great collection of guest stars that include Lon Chaney, Jr., Martin Milner (Route 66), Brian Keith (Mountain Men), Beverly Garland (My Three Sons), James Drury (The Virginian), Rick Jason (Combat), Leslie Nielson (Airplane), Martin Landau (Mission Impossible), Linda Cristal (High Chaparral) and on. The stories seem to get better and better as the series developed particularly the battle over water in the ""Dry Drive"" and there is even a psychological drama of a shadowy hired killer stalking the men in the herd called ""Executioner"". Excellent first year, the cast stayed through the run until Sheb Wooley (also a singer who sang the great 50s hit ""Purple People Eater') left for two years and Fleming skipped the last season and ironically drowned in his last film. The only blemish besides the ""in town"" episode was an excellent episode about wolves stalking the herd with a killer in their midst. Due to the lack of trained wolves, it clearly appears that they had to use several German shepherds running in the dark. But overlook that and you have one of the more fascinating episodes.

They would drag out the cap-pistols and stick horses and play Rawhide.  No one wanted be Rowdy Yates.  They always forced my younger brother David to play Rowdy and he'd cry.  Everyone wanted to be Mr. Favor.  Handsome, sexy voiced Eric Fleming was a star on the rise.  We saw him in various Sci-Fi flicks in the 50s like that horrid thing with Zaa-Zaa as Queen of Outer Space, and some nifty who dun its, but it was as Ms. Favor he was rising to the top.  Hard to recall gravelly-voiced Eastwood was considered a wimp!Favor was filming a flick in the Amazon during summer break and drowned.  Hollywood lost a rising star and Rawhide lost Mr. Favor, dooming the series.  It lumbered on with Rowdy taking over as trail boss for a time, only the series lack the force without the dominating presence of Fleming.  It would be curious if we could turn back time and alter events--one wonders if Eastwood would have finally come out of Fleming's shadow and become the superstar he did had Fleming not died.The series ran for 8 years, and holds up well.  There were so many westerns during this period, and when you go back to view them, they are sadly quite dated.  NOT Rawhide.  The strength of the acting, the vision of the producers and directors, kept Rawhide popular back then, but also gives you stories which stands the test of time.

This wouldn't have been my first choice for a TV Western though, that would've been Maverick if Warner Bros. will ever release it. Rawhide is a CBS/Paramount product so it's not their fault. Rawhide was the launching pad for Clint Eastwood's career. He had been around for several years acting in movies ranging from bit roles to substantial roles but never actually being in a major featured role. Some of his credits from the fifties include the movies Tarantula & Francis the Talking Mule. Clint Eastwood learned many things while on Rawhide: acting & directing being the main two. It was unfortunate though, Hollywood wouldn't give Eastwood an opportunity to be a leading man, he had to go to Italy & star in three spaghetti Westerns for Sergio Leone before he would get his chance in America.The TV series actually stars Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, trail boss. Fleming wasn't a household name either, he had also been around Hollywood for a while, not really getting somewhere either. He had starred in some grade C movies but stardom eluded him. It's unlikely that anyone remembers Fleming other than viewers of Rawhide or movie buffs. It's for that reason that Eastwood is more featured on the covers, he is, after all, the most recognizable face from the series.The DVD set features all 22 episodes of the first (actually a half) season of Rawhide. The picture quality is excellent but bonus material is scant. The bonus material consists of production notes for each episode &  a short Clint Eastwood biography, one per disc. Rawhide also featured Paul Brinegar as Wishbone & Sheb Wooley as Pete Nolan,both were good friends of Eastwood who would later use them in a few of his movies. Robert Cabal is in one episode as Hey Soos (which just goes to show that Hollywood was ignorant and/or extremely scared they would offend somebody, it's spelled J-e-s-u-s.). The one thing I found to be odd occured in the final episode. Sheb Wooley had the starring role for that particular episode, ""Incident of the Roman Candles"". Producers nowadays wouldn't ever have a featured cast member starring in the final episode of the season.""Head 'em up! Move 'em out!""

Lovins ""Mr. Jim""","[3, 3]","CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""RAWHIDE: THE FIRST SEASON"" (9 January 1959 - 25 September 1959) (1180 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine.

986206,A25JH6CO4DVINS,B000F9T70K,Junglies,"[5, 5]","Throughout my childhood my television watching was dominated by two types of show, westerns and secret agents. Have Gun Will Travel, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train, Cheyenne to name but a few were particular favourites but the one which has withstood the ravages of time the most has been Rawhide.Others will cite the large and looming prescence of Clint Eastwood as a major reason for this durability but for the me the success of this particular show likes elsewhere.While the typical western concentrated on the wild west aspects of gunslinging, bank robbery, Indians, etc the plots of Rawhide are of a much different origin. To be sure there are aspects of those experiences but the backdrop and textures of Rawhide are much richer and complex.For example, the black and white views of right and wrong out west are much more of shades of gray with the show. There is a greater degree of complexity involved and differing perspectives. People make mistakes and come to realise that. Older, wiser heads prevail over more hotheaded, reactive ones.Similarly, Rawhide deals with issues which often would not be deemed worthy in the typical western. there is a greater human touch involved. Often it is easier to understand a perception of fear which engenders violent action as a pre-emptive strike than to see all of the protagonists as men of deliberate action.The notion of lawlessness is also superceeded by a sense of the growth and limits of the law in the face of challenges, both physical and political, from people who live outside of the traditional lawkeeping forces of military or much later sherrif's personnel.Character development is another understated aspect of this show where we see the community of trail herders grow with each passing mile. The almost father-son relationship between Gil favour and Rowdy Yates which results in the latter growing from a young hothead to an older wiser and more mature second in command is intersting to observe through passing episodes.What I am trying to say is that Rawhide takes a broader view of the west than almost every other show and it is that which has sustained it's popularity over the years.A great series which I am happy to watch over again.",5,"Head 'em up, move 'em out",1256428800,"10 25, 2009",2009,2201,"['childhood', 'television', 'watching', 'was', 'dominated', 'two', 'types', 'show', 'westerns', 'secret', 'agents', 'Have', 'Gun', 'Will', 'Travel', 'Gunsmoke', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Cheyenne', 'name', 'few', 'were', 'particular', 'favourites', 'one', 'withstood', 'ravages', 'time', 'most', 'been', 'Rawhide.Others', 'will', 'cite', 'large', 'looming', 'prescence', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'major', 'reason', 'durability', 'success', 'particular', 'show', 'typical', 'western', 'concentrated', 'wild', 'west', 'aspects', 'gunslinging', 'bank', 'robbery', 'Indians', 'etc', 'plots', 'Rawhide', 'are', 'much', 'different', 'origin', 'be', 'sure', 'are', 'aspects', 'experiences', 'backdrop', 'textures', 'Rawhide', 'are', 'much', 'richer', 'complex.For', 'example', 'black', 'white', 'views', 'right', 'wrong', 'out', 'west', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'shades', 'gray', 'show', 'greater', 'degree', 'complexity', 'involved', 'differing', 'perspectives', 'People', 'make', 'mistakes', 'come', 'realise', 'Older', 'wiser', 'heads', 'prevail', 'more', 'hotheaded', 'reactive', 'ones.Similarly', 'Rawhide', 'issues', 'often', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'deemed', 'worthy', 'typical', 'western', 'greater', 'human', 'touch', 'involved', 'Often', 'easier', 'understand', 'perception', 'fear', 'violent', 'action', 'pre-emptive', 'strike', 'see', 'protagonists', 'men', 'deliberate', 'action.The', 'notion', 'lawlessness', 'also', 'superceeded', 'sense', 'growth', 'limits', 'law', 'face', 'challenges', 'physical', 'political', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'traditional', 'lawkeeping', 'forces', 'military', 'much', 'later', 'sherrif', 'personnel.Character', 'development', 'understated', 'aspect', 'show', 'where', 'see', 'community', 'trail', 'herders', 'grow', 'passing', 'mile', 'almost', 'father-son', 'relationship', 'Gil', 'favour', 'Rowdy', 'Yates', 'results', 'latter', 'growing', 'young', 'hothead', 'older', 'wiser', 'more', 'mature', 'second', 'command', 'intersting', 'observe', 'passing', 'episodes.What', 'am', 'trying', 'say', 'Rawhide', 'broader', 'view', 'west', 'almost', 'other', 'show', 'sustained', 'popularity', 'years.A', 'great', 'series', 'am', 'happy', 'watch', 'over', 'again']",Rawhide - The Complete First Season

Better than ""Maverick"", better than ""Wagon Train"", better than ""Gunsmoke"", better than ""Daniel Boone"", better than all of them.Why?Because, first and foremost, the writing is fantastic. Almost each story is unpredictable, has twists of fate you don't expect, and sometimes the characters surprise you with their actions, because they are real human beings, not cardboard cutouts of characters.The series is shot beautifully, directed impeccably, and acted excellently.I had forgotten how good this was, but got it just for nostalgia. After I watched it, I realized how great it is!I would recommend this series to ANYone and EVERYone!

986210,AYNRYB9OK06P1,B000F9T70K,Mad Mau,"[38, 40]","I am thrilled that they will soon be releasing the first season of Rawhide.  Growing up in the sixties, most of my favorite T.V. shows were westerns and back then they imparted great values and contained good role models.Just think of the lead characters in those great old westerns: Cheyenne, Paladin, Matt Dillon, Lucas McCain, Gil Favor; the list goes on and on.  Each and every one of them had personalities all their own, but they shared a couple of common unshakable qualities; they had a strong sense of morality and a code of ethics.Todays heroes are politically correct and ""morally complex"".  Translation:  They're decent people but will skim the edge of dishonesty if it suits their needs and purpose.  You didn't see that sort of ideological compromise with the Matt Dillons of yesteryear we grew up with.  No sir, they saw the world in black and white, not muddy shades of gray.  They recognized the good in men but were quick to realize that evil is as evil does.  They drew a line in the sand they wouldn't cross and by god, right was right and wrong was wrong.Is it wrong to wish these values on our leaders, role models and politicians of today?But I digress.......Here are the first season episodes for Rawhide:1  Incident of the Tumbleweed Wagon - Airdate: 1/9/19592  Incident at Alabaster Plain - Airdate: 1/16/19593  Incident with an Executioner - Airdate: 1/23/19594  Incident of the Widowed Dove - Airdate: 1/30/19595  Incident On the Edge of Madness - Airdate: 2/6/19596  Incident of the Power and the Plow - Airdate: 2/13/19597  Incident at Barker Springs - Airdate: 2/20/19598  Incident West of Lano - Airdate: 2/27/19599  Incident of the Town in Terror - Airdate: 3/4/195910  Incident of the Golden Calf - Airdate: 3/13/195911  Incident of the Coyote Weed - Airdate: 3/20/195912  Incident of the Cubasco - Airdate: 4/3/195913  Incident of the Curious Street - Airdate: 4/10/195914  Incident of the Dog Days - Airdate: 4/17/195915  Incident of the Calico Gun - Airdate: 4/24/195916  Incident of the Misplaced Indians - Airdate: 5/1/195917  Incident of Fear in the Streets - Airdate: 5/8/195918  Incident Below the Brazos - Airdate: 5/15/195919  Incident of the Dry Drive - Airdate: 5/22/195920  Incident of the Judas Trap - Airdate: 6/5/195921  Incident in No Man's Land - Airdate: 6/12/195922  Incident of a Burst of Evil - Airdate: 6/26/195923  Incident of the Roman Candles - Airdate: 7/10/1959Enjoy, I know I will.",5,What the world needs is more Cowboys!,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2444,"['am', 'thrilled', 'will', 'soon', 'be', 'releasing', 'first', 'season', 'Rawhide', 'Growing', 'up', 'sixties', 'most', 'favorite', 'T.V', 'shows', 'were', 'westerns', 'back', 'then', 'imparted', 'great', 'values', 'contained', 'good', 'role', 'models.Just', 'think', 'lead', 'characters', 'great', 'old', 'westerns', 'Cheyenne', 'Paladin', 'Matt', 'Dillon', 'Lucas', 'McCain', 'Gil', 'Favor', 'list', 'one', 'had', 'personalities', 'own', 'shared', 'couple', 'common', 'unshakable', 'qualities', 'had', 'strong', 'sense', 'morality', 'code', 'ethics.Todays', 'heroes', 'are', 'politically', 'correct', 'morally', 'complex', 'Translation', ""'re"", 'decent', 'people', 'will', 'skim', 'edge', 'dishonesty', 'suits', 'needs', 'purpose', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'sort', 'ideological', 'compromise', 'Matt', 'Dillons', 'yesteryear', 'grew', 'up', 'sir', 'saw', 'world', 'black', 'white', 'not', 'muddy', 'shades', 'gray', 'recognized', 'good', 'men', 'were', 'quick', 'realize', 'evil', 'evil', 'drew', 'line', 'sand', 'would', ""n't"", 'cross', 'god', 'right', 'was', 'right', 'wrong', 'was', 'wrong.Is', 'wrong', 'wish', 'values', 'leaders', 'role', 'models', 'politicians', 'today', 'digress', 'are', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'Rawhide:1', 'Incident', 'Tumbleweed', 'Wagon', 'Airdate', '1/9/19592', 'Incident', 'Alabaster', 'Plain', 'Airdate', '1/16/19593', 'Incident', 'Executioner', 'Airdate', '1/23/19594', 'Incident', 'Widowed', 'Dove', 'Airdate', '1/30/19595', 'Incident', 'Edge', 'Madness', 'Airdate', '2/6/19596', 'Incident', 'Power', 'Plow', 'Airdate', '2/13/19597', 'Incident', 'Barker', 'Springs', 'Airdate', '2/20/19598', 'Incident', 'West', 'Lano', 'Airdate', '2/27/19599', 'Incident', 'Town', 'Terror', 'Airdate', '3/4/195910', 'Incident', 'Golden', 'Calf', 'Airdate', '3/13/195911', 'Incident', 'Coyote', 'Weed', 'Airdate', '3/20/195912', 'Incident', 'Cubasco', 'Airdate', '4/3/195913', 'Incident', 'Curious', 'Street', 'Airdate', '4/10/195914', 'Incident', 'Dog', 'Days', 'Airdate', '4/17/195915', 'Incident', 'Calico', 'Gun', 'Airdate', '4/24/195916', 'Incident', 'Misplaced', 'Indians', 'Airdate', '5/1/195917', 'Incident', 'Fear', 'Streets', 'Airdate', '5/8/195918', 'Incident', 'Brazos', 'Airdate', '5/15/195919', 'Incident', 'Dry', 'Drive', 'Airdate', '5/22/195920', 'Incident', 'Judas', 'Trap', 'Airdate', '6/5/195921', 'Incident', 'No', 'Man', 'Land', 'Airdate', '6/12/195922', 'Incident', 'Burst', 'Evil', 'Airdate', '6/26/195923', 'Incident', 'Roman', 'Candles', 'Airdate', '7/10/1959Enjoy', 'know', 'will']",Rawhide - The Complete First Season

986213,AYU9LBROYQBG6,B000F9T70K,"Noel Serrano ""Gala Foundation http://gfoundat...","[3, 3]","The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white. It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke. Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide. Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows[citation needed]. Rawhide was the fifth-longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.The show had a gruelling schedule, being mostly weekly with a 3-4 month break between seasons. After the first season of 22 episodes, seasons 2-7 were 30 episodes. Often the only way the lead actors could get a break was if they were said to be off on business or whatever. On rare occasions, the show would feature a small number of the actors and some misfortune, maybe in a town, which would give the others time off.In an early show, the date is given as 1869. It is given that there are 20-25 riders looking after 3,000 head of cattle. Gil Favor revealed this is about the maximum manageable size for a herd of cows. This cattle drive begins in San Antonio, Texas, and makes its way along the Sedalia Trail (Sedalia, the final destination, is in Missouri about 50 miles east from Kansas City). The herd is estimated to be worth about $50-60,000 if sold at market and represents a pool of animals from 200 owners. The Trail Boss carries a considerable sum of cash for all necessities and all possible emergencies. Pay was a dollar a day and often the drovers would go through six months pay in days at the end of the trail, often gambling and drinking all of it away. There were also women to help them spend the money. Riding ""drag"" was often a punishment since it was behind the herd, so you'd pick up all their dust. Drives had a ""Remuda"" which was a pool of extra horses since if something happened to a man's horse, he would be no good without an instant replacement.The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others. The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting. Sometimes one of the members of the cattle drive or some of the others would venture into a nearby town and encounter some trouble or other from which they needed to be rescued. Rowdy Yates was a young hothead in the earliest episodes and Favour had to keep a tight rein on him. Favor was often a hard man and there were a few times when people including Yates mutinied under him after working too hard or after a good tongue lashing. He had to fight some times and mostly but not always, won. Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth. A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up. In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.The series was not afraid to face tough issues. Robert Culp played an ex-soldier on the drive who had become dangerously addicted to morphine. Jesus (Hey Soos) being Mexican faced racism a number of times. There was still anger left over from the Civil War which had ended only four years earlier. The Poco Tiempo episode reveals that Rowdy's father's name was Dan, that Rowdy came from S.W. Texas and that he went off to war at 16. Trail Boss Favor had been a Confederate Captain in the war. There were still Indians about, though often not that wild, some still wanted cattle as payment for going through their land. There were some rough-tough people in the shows and Gil Favor was tortured by having his face held near a fire in one episode. In another, people had ""the plague"" and guns were used to enforce quarantine. Though towns liked the drover's money, they did not like them coming into town in numbers and getting drunk. There was also cattle rustlers in many different forms.In episode 67 Incident Near the Promised Land, the cattle drive finally reached Sedalia (for the first time in the series). Unusually, episode 68 continues on from that, where the cattle have been sold and the men celebrate in town and decide on their futures with even Favor thinking of leaving the business. Instead of the usual ending where Gil Favor tells his men to: ""Head 'em up! Move 'em out!"" and the cattle move off, this episode had the end titles over a view of a Sedalia Street. Episode 69 sees Gil Favor visiting his two daughters, Gillian and Maggie who live with their Aunt Elena in Philadelphia. Episode 70 and a number of the men are back together and heading back to San Antonio about 650 miles away, with a herd of horses (used in the titles instead of cattle). Episode 71 sees a new cattle drive ready to go but the owner of 1600 of the cattle wants to be in charge so Favor reluctantly signs on as a ramrod, but after some problems, Favor is boss against the end of the show. These five episodes made up one storyline instead of the usual single episode stories which could have been set anywhere in the West.The show featured stage and location. Location was probably not far from the studios and made the best use of maybe 100 cattle. Scenes in camp and situations between men were often stage and though fairly well done with scenery and a painted backdrop, the ground was just too flat to be real.",5,"THE  COUSIN OF WAGON TRAIN,

Now butt those saddles!!!!,"" growled Trailboss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) to his band of cattle drovers during an episode of Rawhide.it was lines like these delivered by Fleming with such vim and vigor that really made Rawhide such an outstanding western. Fleming was great as The Boss because he was an imperfect man. Sure he stood by his convictions and always battled the bad guys but he wasn't always right and he didn't always win. He was a believable character who often got down and dirty and came out bloody along with the rest of his crew. He was a man's man and a lady's man all wrapped into one.His co-star was Clint Eastwood as the handsome, yet sometimes goofy Ramrod Rowdy Yates. I really liked Clint in this role because he actually played a good and decent guy who always tried to do the right thing. And in later seasons he evolved into more of the tough guy that would later define his movie career characters.The rest of the ensemble inlcuded Paul Brinegar as the wily old camp cook ""Wishbone"", Sheb Wooley as dependable trail scout Pete Nolan, and Steve Raines as drover Jim Quince who could sing ""Skip to my Loo"" with the best of them. Rocky Shahan was the big and loveable drover Joe Scarlett and Robert Cabal was the horse rangler ""Hey Soos"" (obviously the network did not want to put ""JESUS"" in the credits!). and finally James Murdoch played the ""slow-minded"" cook's louse Mushy.In later seasons the cast went through other incarnations. Sheb Wooley would be replaced briefly by Charles Gray as the maverick Clay Forrester. the final season would see Fleming and most of the cast gone and have John Ireland and Raymond St. Jaques join new Trail Boss Rowdy Yates for the series final ride into the sunset.The stories were mostly compelling and the characters were likeable and worked well together. in a lot of ways, Rawhide was exactly like Star Trek. Favor was Captain Kirk, Rowdy was Spock, and Wishbone was Dr. McCoy. instead of a starship you had a cattle drive seeking out new frontiers and new adventures every week. if you watch both series you will notice the similarities and a number of the Star Trek writers (Gene Coon and Fred Freiberger) worked on both series.the bottom line is that if you like classic westerns you will really enjoy Rawhide. it is a fun and gritty and interesting show with great characters and stories.",5,Stampede!!!!,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",2006,2405,"['What', 'do', 'think', 'beauty', 'contest', 'Now', 'butt', 'saddles', 'growled', 'Trailboss', 'Gil', 'Favor', 'Eric', 'Fleming', 'band', 'cattle', 'drovers', 'episode', 'Rawhide.it', 'was', 'lines', 'delivered', 'Fleming', 'such', 'vim', 'vigor', 'really', 'made', 'Rawhide', 'outstanding', 'western', 'Fleming', 'was', 'great', 'Boss', 'was', 'imperfect', 'man', 'Sure', 'stood', 'convictions', 'always', 'battled', 'bad', 'guys', 'was', ""n't"", 'always', 'right', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'win', 'was', 'believable', 'character', 'who', 'often', 'got', 'down', 'dirty', 'came', 'out', 'bloody', 'rest', 'crew', 'was', 'man', 'man', 'lady', 'man', 'wrapped', 'one.His', 'co-star', 'was', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'handsome', 'yet', 'sometimes', 'goofy', 'Ramrod', 'Rowdy', 'Yates', 'really', 'liked', 'Clint', 'role', 'actually', 'played', 'good', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'tried', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'later', 'seasons', 'evolved', 'more', 'tough', 'guy', 'would', 'later', 'define', 'movie', 'career', 'characters.The', 'rest', 'ensemble', 'inlcuded', 'Paul', 'Brinegar', 'wily', 'old', 'camp', 'cook', 'Wishbone', 'Sheb', 'Wooley', 'dependable', 'trail', 'scout', 'Pete', 'Nolan', 'Steve', 'Raines', 'drover', 'Jim', 'Quince', 'who', 'could', 'sing', 'Skip', 'Loo', 'best', 'Rocky', 'Shahan', 'was', 'big', 'loveable', 'drover', 'Joe', 'Scarlett', 'Robert', 'Cabal', 'was', 'horse', 'rangler', 'Hey', 'Soos', 'obviously', 'network', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'put', 'JESUS', 'credits', 'finally', 'James', 'Murdoch', 'played', 'slow-minded', 'cook', 'louse', 'Mushy.In', 'later', 'cast', 'went', 'other', 'incarnations', 'Sheb', 'Wooley', 'would', 'be', 'replaced', 'briefly', 'Charles', 'Gray', 'maverick', 'Clay', 'Forrester', 'final', 'season', 'would', 'see', 'Fleming', 'most', 'cast', 'gone', 'have', 'John', 'Ireland', 'Raymond', 'St.', 'Jaques', 'join', 'new', 'Trail', 'Boss', 'Rowdy', 'series', 'final', 'ride', 'sunset.The', 'stories', 'were', 'mostly', 'compelling', 'characters', 'were', 'likeable', 'worked', 'well', 'together', 'lot', 'ways', 'Rawhide', 'was', 'exactly', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Favor', 'was', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Rowdy', 'was', 'Spock', 'Wishbone', 'was', 'Dr.', 'McCoy', 'instead', 'starship', 'had', 'cattle', 'drive', 'seeking', 'out', 'new', 'frontiers', 'new', 'adventures', 'week', 'watch', 'series', 'will', 'notice', 'similarities', 'number', 'Star', 'Trek', 'writers', 'Gene', 'Coon', 'Fred', 'Freiberger', 'worked', 'series.the', 'bottom', 'line', 'like', 'classic', 'westerns', 'will', 'really', 'enjoy', 'Rawhide', 'fun', 'gritty', 'interesting', 'show', 'great', 'characters', 'stories']",Rawhide - The Complete First Season

986218,A3AD071UEP20WS,B000F9T70K,"Roger Long ""longrush""","[6, 7]","Compared with other TV westerns, ""Rawhide"" is above average, which may be damning with faint praise.  However, the viewer should never assume that the series resembled the actual West much at all.  In fact, there are very few westerns that do, and many of those are the so-called spaghetti western.  Other examples of realism are rare indeed.  Here are a few of the digressions, without regard to level of importance:(1) Young women are too clean, too pretty, and wearing bustiers and clothes that are too well tailored.  Mad Magazine commented long ago that if women in the old west had looked like the women in western movies, the wild west would have been a lot wilder.(2) The men are wearing the wrong hats, the wrong clothes, are too clean and clean shaved, have capped teeth, almost never have their trousers tucked into their boots, etc.  Look at the photos of the actual cowboys of the era if you doubt this.  Cowboys especially were a seedy lot.(3) The towns are far too neat.  Despite the myriad horses and cattle passing through, the streets are remarkably clear of manure.  There are no flies. The streets are level, packed sand, without ruts.(4) There are more gunfights in westerns than there ever were in reality.  Six guns were remarkably inaccurate, except at close range.  Shooting the gun out of a foe's hand was pure luck.  Fast draws artists were killed by slower, careful aimers.  Most residents were not fighting but were working to stay alive--just like now.(5) Saloon fights in westerns almost always had someone crashing through a window without receiving a scratch, or getting a whisky bottle broken over their head without being killed, or having a wooden chair crashed over them, or getting hit with a haymaker, or, or, or.  Anyone who has seen two men brawl in reality knows that someone always got hurt, and one solid punch usually ended it.(6) Saloons were in reality almost always holes in the wall, and the soiled doves who worked them had names such as Squrrel Tooth Alice.(7) It seldom rains and almost never ever snows in westerns.  Much of the scenery looks suspiciously like the deserts of California, near Hollywood.  I've seen the very same boulders in numerous westerns, serials and even sci-fi films.  N.B.  Kansas did not have tall mountains in the background.Well, you get the point.  These flaws may seem petty to those who are weaned on western movies, but the inconsistancies mar the verisimilitude.  The real west was far more interesting than the idealized version of the movies.  Too bad it isn't shown.""Rawhide"" is about a cattle drive from Texas to a Kansas railhead, with the cowboys getting sidetracked constantly to have adventures that havenothing to do with their occupation, a job that required their undivided attention.  Moving a large heard hundreds of miles was a 24-hour per day job.There are some wonderful books by men who actually participated in the drives.  Read those to know how it really was.
