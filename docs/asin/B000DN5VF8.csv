963188,A26FPAHSLQKGFH,B000DN5VF8,"Amy Keene ""filleirlandaise""","[5, 10]","I had read very positive things about ""Joshua"" before having seen it, hearing it described as ""disturbing"" and ""something you won't be able to get out of your head."" Unfortunately, I didn't find that this movie lived up to its glowing reviews. It had nothing to do with the movie being made ""on the cheap""--I actually thought the gore effects were pretty good--but the fact that the story just isn't very plausible. Would three young boys really do what they did in this movie? Probably not--they'd likely get bored with their ""experiment"" after a little while.Another problem I had was that some of the characters seemed to have no place in the story at all. Uncle Tom--what was the deal with him? Trisha the trashy sister--where does she fit in to all of this? And is it just me, or does Brisbee have the most inept police force since ""Car 54, Where Are You?"" Wally comes to the door covered in blood and the other officer accepts the explanation that ""nothing"" happened? Riiiiight....The acting was pretty good, although I thought a lot of the lines the characters were given were either unnatural--James always sounded as if he was doing his best Hannibal Lecter impersonation--or downright comical. Wally reminded me of Dave Foley on ""Kids in the Hall"", which made it rather hard to think of him as menacing or scary.",1,Not at all what I expected,1142812800,"03 20, 2006",2006,1322,"['had', 'read', 'very', 'positive', 'things', 'Joshua', 'having', 'seen', 'hearing', 'described', 'disturbing', 'something', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'get', 'head', 'Unfortunately', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'movie', 'lived', 'up', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'movie', 'being', 'made', 'cheap', 'actually', 'thought', 'gore', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'fact', 'story', 'just', ""n't"", 'very', 'plausible', 'Would', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'really', 'do', 'what', 'did', 'movie', 'Probably', 'not', ""'d"", 'likely', 'get', 'bored', 'experiment', 'little', 'while.Another', 'problem', 'had', 'was', 'characters', 'seemed', 'have', 'place', 'story', 'Uncle', 'Tom', 'was', 'deal', 'trashy', 'sister', 'where', 'fit', 'just', 'Brisbee', 'have', 'most', 'inept', 'police', 'force', 'Car', '54', 'Are', 'Wally', 'door', 'covered', 'blood', 'other', 'officer', 'explanation', 'nothing', 'happened', 'Riiiiight', '.The', 'acting', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'thought', 'lot', 'lines', 'characters', 'were', 'given', 'were', 'either', 'unnatural', 'James', 'always', 'sounded', 'was', 'doing', 'best', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'impersonation', 'downright', 'comical', 'Wally', 'reminded', 'Dave', 'Foley', 'Kids', 'Hall', 'made', 'rather', 'hard', 'think', 'menacing', 'scary']",Joshua

The story is very demented, sick and twisted. Mainly the reason I like it so much. As a die hard horror fan, some of the scenes are even a shock to me.The movie starts out with a guy named Kelby and his fiancee Amelia. Kelby brings along Amelia to the town of Bisbee,Indiana where he grew up, for the funeral of his sadistic father that died of a heart attack on death row for the murder of Kelbys baby sister. As much as Kelby tried to move on from his past, his family and friends refuse to let what he did as a child go. As the famous saying goes, "" The past always comes back to haunt you"", or in this case eat you. Amelia soon finds out that her soon to be husband is not what he appeared to be. What comes next is full of indescribable, unnatural happenings that will change anyones mind about the human race. Just when you think people are normal a movie like this one comes out to show you what individuals are really capable of.For a really low budget film, everything was well done.

963193,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,B000DN5VF8,"E K Maxmias ""Frighteningly Real""","[2, 3]","This might be the most unique film I've ever attempted to write a review about.  There are so many aspects to talk about; so many qualifiers, so many issues.  I'm going to need to break this into pieces.-SHOULD THE BUDGET MATTER?This is what I asked myself when deciding to rate ""Joshua"".  Should I cut a film slack for having a $2 budget?  The answer turned out to be YES and NO.  Yes, I should cut it some slack and, in this case, even give extra credit for achieving so much with so little.  No, I really should not cut slack as far as the entertainment factor goes.  You might use this review to decide if you want to buy ""Joshua"" and cutting slack would not be fair to you.  So there, you and I now know where I'm coming from; Joshua should be admired for its achievements as a low budget indi-horror film and criticized for any problems that arise while attempting to entertain horror fans.-TO BE ADMIREDThe first thing that struck me about Joshua was that the film makers had to hold back on how they executed violence and gore mostly for budget reasons.  They really needed to be strategic about when to let the meat fly.  Despite this, the implications of horrific deeds were clear enough to make even hardened horror fans squirm.  The next thing that became obvious was that these actors were getting free room and meals and the promise of at least 3 pages of spoken lines as payment.  Some of them were pretty ""summer workshop"" While the lead actors earned steak and a room with a view; fairly strong performances by them.  By far the most impressive thing about Joshua was the original story.  I can't explain the concept without spoiling it, but it might be the most demented idea for a horror film and I would seriously question Travis Betz's (Writer/Director) overall mental state.  I would not dare, in my darkest fantasies, to imagine this concept, let alone the details of it.  There are multiple surprises at the end of the film that you could not possibly put together completely, yet none of them are cheap or extraneous.-YOU CAN'T WIN THEM ALLAs admirable as this effort was, some things about ""Joshua"" made the viewing experience less than great.  Perhaps the worst thing about this film was the script (not the story, but the spoken words).  Sometimes what is said and how it is said made little sense.  As an example (I'll try hard not to spoil anything); at one point, a couple of ""conspirators"" are discussing hiding evidence.  Instead of arguing in angry but hushed voices, they are shouting so everyone can hear.  And they say things that don't quite jive with the established mindsets of the characters.  Of Course, many of the actors were not very good.  I usually can forgive this in a horror film if it is played in a campy or cheesy way, but this is such a heavy story that light acting is a distraction.  These are actually mild criticisms but they did have a detrimental effect to the overall mood of the film.-ABOUT THE MUSICMusic is a very evident element of ""Joshua"".  From the beginning, you realize this is not going to be a dated sound track.  In an attempt at dissonance, classical music was used at strategic moments.  This was admirable in a sense but also became a bit of a cheap devise.  Using classical music is almost an automatic ticket to a declaration of art.  Even though it added a bit to the creepiness in the beginning, it started to feel forced as time elapsed.  This is obviously a very subjective topic and could be viewed an infinite number of ways.  I admired the attempt but I thought the use of classical music was a bit clumsy and pretentious.-ABOUT THE CAMERA WORKLike the music, the camera work had its highs and lows.  Sometime we have inventive and adventurous angles and techniques.  Other times we get amateur handi-cam work that perhaps was intended to add a sense of realism but came off simply as bad camera work.  Fortunately, the good outpaced the bad and the bad could certainly have been worse.  Overall, It was the clever ways in which things were NOT shown while still making me squirm that I found worthy of praise.-GREAT TOOL FOR PARENTS WITH DAUGHTERSI'm going to show this to my daughter before her first date.  She may cancel before it begins.  (Heh, heh, heh!)-SO, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?I think this film is definitely not for everyone, even some horror fans.  ""Joshua"" is not an easy view.  Some of the characters here would make Hannibal Lecter seem like a viable option as a baby sitter.  There's plenty of disturbing violence despite the limited gore.  The characters are a bit uneven in portrayal and conception but overall interesting.  The story is highly original and equally ""sociopathic"" (if that's a word?).  For those looking for fun and camp, this is played pretty straight, so you might not like it.  And for those so inclined, no nudity occurs ever.  The DVD is very limited (a handful of ""deleted"" scenes) but the quality is fine.  I don't regret buying ""Joshua"" but I would still recommend renting first.Concept and Story:  5 starsExecution: 2.5 starsLow Budget Bonus; 0.5 starsA strange and very shaky 4 star average (3.75

It has the aesthetic of 70's grind laced with what I can best describe as analog surrealism. I have no idea if that could possibly make sense to anyone who hasn't seen this.I was hesitant on this one because I thought it was going to be another lame shot-on-video ""throwback"" attempt. It is nothing of the sort. It is low budget, but in the ""Evil Dead"" sort of way.The plot twists are a lot of fun. No, nothing mind blowing or genius but it is just clever enough to feel fresh and not fall into mediocrity. Joshua shines. Made in 2005, I was not expecting this to feel like genuine 70's/80's low budget horror cheeze... but oh does it ever.I don't want to go too in depth because the plot doesn't matter. I read some of the negative reviews here and all I can say is that those people just don't get it. If you love films like ""Basket Case"" you will love this as well. And even if you don't love it, you will at least see that it belongs in the category of great b-horror cinema. I think the type of horror film this is by way of the look and feel are more important for you to be aware of. Especially since the horror market is so saturated with junk that you have no idea if it is worthy or not since producers clog the internet with fake reviews to pump up sales.I wasn't sure if the Fangoria stamp on this should have been taken as a sign of greatness or lameness.
