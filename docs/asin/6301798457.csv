This embarassing chapter in America's history (up there with slavery, the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; south, and Japanese internment camps of WW2) was responsible for thousands of Hollywood job losses, the imprisonment of the great writer Ring Lardner, the expatriation of Chaplin, Paul Robeson, et al.And all of this for a ridiculous &quot;witch hunt&quot; by some sanctimonious &amp; hypocritical power-hungry politicians; with trumped up hearings gathered together faster than you can say &quot;Monica.&quot;  Well eventually it ended up backfiring on the anti-commie crowd of course, although I guess sure helped Ronald Reagan to be president of the Screen Actors Guild, then CA, and the White House weren't far behind (easy when you sell out enough I guess).But gee, since Chaplin was up against these zealots (who are the real &quot;anti-American&quot; ones if people actually knew their history), I suppose we should be able to forgive Chaplin for not being so subtle in &quot;A King in New York!&quot;",5,Chaplin was way ahead of his time in film and America,982886400,"02 23, 2001",2001,1167,"['What', 'find', 'amazing', 'even', 'year', '2001', 'people', 'are', 'so', 'brain-washed', 'corporate', 'media', 'can', 'complain', 'Chaplin', 'bashing', 'McArthy', 'era', 'embarassing', 'chapter', 'America', 'history', 'there', 'slavery', 'quot', 'Jim', 'Crow', 'quot', 'Japanese', 'internment', 'camps', 'WW2', 'was', 'responsible', 'thousands', 'Hollywood', 'job', 'losses', 'imprisonment', 'great', 'writer', 'Ring', 'Lardner', 'expatriation', 'Chaplin', 'Paul', 'Robeson', 'et', 'ridiculous', 'quot', 'witch', 'hunt', 'quot', 'sanctimonious', 'amp', 'hypocritical', 'power-hungry', 'politicians', 'trumped', 'up', 'hearings', 'gathered', 'together', 'faster', 'can', 'say', 'quot', 'Monica.', 'quot', 'Well', 'eventually', 'ended', 'up', 'backfiring', 'anti-commie', 'crowd', 'course', 'guess', 'sure', 'helped', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'be', 'president', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'then', 'CA', 'White', 'House', 'were', ""n't"", 'far', 'easy', 'when', 'sell', 'enough', 'guess', '.But', 'gee', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'up', 'zealots', 'who', 'are', 'real', 'quot', 'anti-American', 'quot', 'ones', 'people', 'actually', 'knew', 'history', 'suppose', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'forgive', 'Chaplin', 'not', 'being', 'so', 'subtle', 'quot', 'A', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'quot']",N/A
267771,A62G4QX6XQVLP,6301798457,Anyechka,"[1, 2]","This two-disc collection contains Chaplin's penultimate film, 'A King in New York,' which was also his final starring film, and a much earlier film he directed but only appears in for all of two seconds in a heavily disguised cameo role, 'A Woman of Paris.'  I find the former to be very underrated, and the latter to be rather overrated.For the life of me, I can't understand why so many film critics love 'A Woman of Paris' and praise it as a beautiful classic masterpiece.  Seeing it more than once hasn't changed my opinion of it.  It's certainly not a horrible film, but overall it just strikes me as an average melodrama, with characters I didn't really like or feel that connected to.  Apart from the fact that it was directed by Chaplin, there isn't much explanation as to why this film is thought of so highly.  I've heard the other explanation that many critics like it because it's about an affair yet isn't moralistic or preachy about it.  The best thing about this movie is the dapper Adolphe Menjou.  This was his breakthrough role; prior his biggest claim to fame was playing Dr. Raoul de St. Hubert in 'The Sheik.'  Menjou steals the show in this otherwise ordinary melodrama, and his acting is as great as it was in all of his other films.  Even though I'm repelled by his odious behavior during the McCarthyist witch hunts, there's no denying that, politics aside, this was a brilliant actor.  This film was also, so Chaplin believed, supposed to have jump-started the solo career of his leading lady Edna Purviance, but it was not to be.  However, my reasons for not caring much for this film are not the reasons why most people in 1923 stayed away in droves.  Back then they didn't like it because they saw Chaplin's name on the marquee but were disappointed they didn't see him in the film, and it wasn't even a comedy, which people had come to expect from him.'A King in New York' is a very funny film and a brilliant satire of America in the Fifties.  It took a lot of guts to make such a film, when America was in the throes of McCarthyism.  Because of the political climate of the time, it wasn't released in America for quite some time, but it was very well-received in Europe.  However, I agree that this film isn't quite as perfect as it could have been, since it tries to take on too many targets at once instead of just focusing on one or two main things to attack and spoof.  He takes on wide-screen movies, television, commercials, the McCarthyist witch hunts and violations of civil liberties, the atomic bomb, plastic surgery, and rock and roll.  Chaplin may have been approaching seventy when he made this film, but he was still just as funny, inventive, original, and genius as ever.  Even though a lot of fans don't like his sound films as much as his silent classics, I've found that I enjoy his sound films just as much as his silents.  They were great and funny in different ways.  There are also moments in this film harkening back to his silent days, such as the comedy routine onstage when he's trying not to laugh so his plastic surgery won't come undone, or when he's pantomiming his restaurant order to the waiter over the din of the band playing right behind his table.  The storyline about young Rupert and his Communist parents, and how his affiliation with Rupert got King Shahdov pegged as a Communist as well, really brought the evils of McCarthyism home for me.  I'd long known all about what went on and was outraged how the government got away with violating so many peoples'  basic civil liberties and rights to freedom of expression and political affiliation for that long, but seeing it acted out onscreen as opposed to merely reading about it really made it seem even scarier and more enfuriating.  It really served the HUAC right when King Shahdov accidentally sprayed them with the hose!For someone just getting into Chaplin, these aren't two of the movies I'd recommending buying or seeing first, but for someone who's seen most of his masterpieces already and is ready for the lesser-known stuff, this would be a good place to start getting into that territory.",4,One overrated and one underrated,1141344000,"03 3, 2006",2006,4124,"['two-disc', 'collection', 'Chaplin', 'penultimate', 'film', 'A', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'also', 'final', 'starring', 'film', 'much', 'earlier', 'film', 'directed', 'only', 'two', 'seconds', 'heavily', 'disguised', 'cameo', 'role', 'A', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'find', 'former', 'be', 'very', 'underrated', 'latter', 'be', 'rather', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'film', 'critics', 'love', 'A', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'praise', 'beautiful', 'classic', 'masterpiece', 'Seeing', 'more', 'once', ""n't"", 'changed', 'opinion', 'certainly', 'not', 'horrible', 'film', 'overall', 'just', 'strikes', 'average', 'melodrama', 'characters', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'feel', 'connected', 'Apart', 'fact', 'was', 'directed', 'Chaplin', ""n't"", 'much', 'explanation', 'why', 'film', 'thought', 'so', 'highly', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'other', 'explanation', 'many', 'critics', 'affair', 'yet', ""n't"", 'moralistic', 'preachy', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'dapper', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'was', 'breakthrough', 'role', 'prior', 'biggest', 'claim', 'fame', 'was', 'playing', 'Dr.', 'Raoul', 'St.', 'Hubert', ""'The"", 'Sheik', 'Menjou', 'show', 'otherwise', 'ordinary', 'melodrama', 'acting', 'as', 'great', 'was', 'other', 'films', 'Even', ""'m"", 'repelled', 'odious', 'behavior', 'McCarthyist', 'witch', 'hunts', 'denying', 'politics', 'aside', 'was', 'brilliant', 'actor', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'so', 'Chaplin', 'believed', 'supposed', 'have', 'jump-started', 'solo', 'career', 'leading', 'lady', 'Edna', 'Purviance', 'was', 'not', 'be', 'However', 'reasons', 'not', 'caring', 'much', 'film', 'are', 'not', 'reasons', 'why', 'most', 'people', '1923', 'stayed', 'away', 'droves', 'Back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'saw', 'Chaplin', 'name', 'marquee', 'were', 'disappointed', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'comedy', 'people', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'America', 'Fifties', 'took', 'lot', 'guts', 'make', 'such', 'film', 'when', 'America', 'was', 'throes', 'McCarthyism', 'political', 'climate', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'released', 'America', 'quite', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'well-received', 'Europe', 'However', 'agree', 'film', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'perfect', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'take', 'too', 'many', 'targets', 'once', 'instead', 'just', 'focusing', 'one', 'two', 'main', 'things', 'attack', 'spoof', 'wide-screen', 'movies', 'television', 'commercials', 'McCarthyist', 'witch', 'hunts', 'violations', 'civil', 'liberties', 'atomic', 'bomb', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'rock', 'roll', 'Chaplin', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'approaching', 'seventy', 'when', 'made', 'film', 'was', 'still', 'just', 'funny', 'inventive', 'original', 'genius', 'ever', 'Even', 'lot', 'fans', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sound', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'silent', 'classics', ""'ve"", 'found', 'enjoy', 'sound', 'films', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'silents', 'were', 'great', 'funny', 'different', 'ways', 'are', 'also', 'moments', 'film', 'harkening', 'back', 'silent', 'days', 'such', 'comedy', 'routine', 'onstage', 'when', 'trying', 'not', 'laugh', 'so', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'come', 'undone', 'when', 'pantomiming', 'restaurant', 'order', 'waiter', 'din', 'band', 'playing', 'right', 'table', 'storyline', 'young', 'Rupert', 'Communist', 'parents', 'how', 'affiliation', 'Rupert', 'got', 'King', 'Shahdov', 'pegged', 'Communist', 'well', 'really', 'brought', 'evils', 'McCarthyism', 'home', ""'d"", 'long', 'known', 'what', 'went', 'was', 'outraged', 'how', 'government', 'got', 'away', 'violating', 'so', 'many', 'peoples', 'basic', 'civil', 'liberties', 'rights', 'freedom', 'expression', 'political', 'affiliation', 'long', 'seeing', 'acted', 'out', 'onscreen', 'opposed', 'merely', 'reading', 'really', 'made', 'seem', 'even', 'scarier', 'more', 'enfuriating', 'really', 'served', 'HUAC', 'right', 'when', 'King', 'Shahdov', 'accidentally', 'sprayed', 'hose', 'someone', 'just', 'getting', 'Chaplin', 'are', ""n't"", 'two', 'movies', ""'d"", 'recommending', 'buying', 'seeing', 'first', 'someone', 'who', 'seen', 'most', 'masterpieces', 'already', 'ready', 'lesser-known', 'stuff', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'getting', 'territory']",N/A
267772,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,6301798457,calvinnme,"[3, 4]","Both of these films, 1923's ""A Woman of Paris"", and 1957's ""A King in New York"" are probably not what you'd expect in a Chaplin film based on the totality of his body of work both in features and in shorts. However, that doesn't mean they're not worthwhile viewing. It just means if you are new to Chaplin, you might not want to start here.""A Woman of Paris"" showed Chaplin's talent behind the camera without him appearing in front of it, except for a lone cameo in which he quickly appears and then disappears acting as a luggage boy. He made it for two reasons, to do some pioneering in cinematic technique and to help give his long time costar and companion Edna Purviance a career boost. The film is actually quite good with great performances by Purviance and by Adolphe Menjou as a carefree playboy. The film did make a star out of Menjou. It didn't really help Purviance that much. The film is about a pair of star-crossed lovers that circumstance drives apart and then brings back together and the eventual tragedy that occurs due to the weakness of will of Purviance's one time fiance, played by Carl Miller. The film was a failure at the box office, not because it was bad, but because audiences expected to see Chaplin when they went to a Chaplin film. The commentary on the film mentions the fact that after the failure of this film Chaplin went back to formulas that were tried and true for him and never really went out on a limb experimenting again, which is too bad for all of us.1957's ""A King in New York"" shows Chaplin at the end of his film career. Refused permission to reenter the U.S. in 1952 due to the idea that he held anti-American beliefs, he actually made this film about a deposed European king in New York in England. The film suffers from production values that are not as high as they were in Chaplin's earlier films, and the commentary points out that Chaplin had much trouble making this film mainly because he was not dealing with familiar personnel in his own studio as he had in his earlier efforts. The film's political statements are heavy-handed, but there are still some good comic turns by Chaplin and his viewpoints and comic bits on America and rampant commercialism and consumerism still hold up today. In fact, they are probably much more relevant today than they were 50 years ago.If you are curious about Chaplin's work you need to eventually view both of these films, just don't start your journey here. If you are just starting out, I recommend you view Image Entertainment's Mutual Comedies. These are 12 two-reel comedies Chaplin made in 1916 and 1917 and show his comic technique evolve from the pants-kicking fests of his Essanay and Keystone films into the sophisticated technique he had from the end of the series onward. Also, the Mutual period was named by Chaplin himself as the era in both his personal and professional life in which he was the happiest.",4,"Not your ""typical"" Chaplin movies",1198454400,"12 24, 2007",2007,2915,"['films', '1923', 'A', 'Woman', 'Paris', '1957', 'A', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'are', 'probably', 'not', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'based', 'totality', 'body', 'work', 'features', 'shorts', 'However', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'re"", 'not', 'worthwhile', 'viewing', 'just', 'are', 'new', 'Chaplin', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'start', 'here', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'showed', 'Chaplin', 'talent', 'camera', 'appearing', 'front', 'lone', 'cameo', 'quickly', 'then', 'acting', 'luggage', 'boy', 'made', 'two', 'reasons', 'do', 'pioneering', 'cinematic', 'technique', 'help', 'give', 'long', 'time', 'costar', 'companion', 'Edna', 'Purviance', 'career', 'boost', 'film', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'great', 'performances', 'Purviance', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'carefree', 'playboy', 'film', 'did', 'make', 'star', 'Menjou', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'help', 'Purviance', 'much', 'film', 'pair', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'circumstance', 'drives', 'apart', 'then', 'back', 'together', 'eventual', 'tragedy', 'due', 'weakness', 'will', 'Purviance', 'one', 'time', 'fiance', 'played', 'Carl', 'Miller', 'film', 'was', 'failure', 'box', 'office', 'not', 'was', 'bad', 'audiences', 'expected', 'see', 'Chaplin', 'when', 'went', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'commentary', 'film', 'fact', 'failure', 'film', 'Chaplin', 'went', 'back', 'formulas', 'were', 'tried', 'true', 'never', 'really', 'went', 'out', 'limb', 'experimenting', 'again', 'too', 'bad', 'us.1957', 'A', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'Chaplin', 'end', 'film', 'career', 'Refused', 'permission', 'reenter', 'U.S.', '1952', 'due', 'idea', 'held', 'anti-American', 'beliefs', 'actually', 'made', 'film', 'deposed', 'European', 'king', 'New', 'York', 'England', 'film', 'suffers', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'high', 'were', 'Chaplin', 'earlier', 'films', 'commentary', 'points', 'out', 'Chaplin', 'had', 'much', 'trouble', 'making', 'film', 'mainly', 'was', 'not', 'dealing', 'familiar', 'personnel', 'own', 'studio', 'had', 'earlier', 'efforts', 'film', 'political', 'statements', 'are', 'heavy-handed', 'are', 'still', 'good', 'comic', 'turns', 'Chaplin', 'viewpoints', 'comic', 'bits', 'America', 'rampant', 'commercialism', 'consumerism', 'still', 'hold', 'up', 'today', 'fact', 'are', 'probably', 'much', 'more', 'relevant', 'today', 'were', '50', 'years', 'are', 'curious', 'Chaplin', 'work', 'need', 'eventually', 'view', 'films', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'start', 'journey', 'here', 'are', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'recommend', 'view', 'Image', 'Entertainment', 'Mutual', 'Comedies', 'are', '12', 'two-reel', 'comedies', 'Chaplin', 'made', '1916', '1917', 'show', 'comic', 'technique', 'evolve', 'pants-kicking', 'fests', 'Essanay', 'Keystone', 'films', 'sophisticated', 'technique', 'had', 'end', 'series', 'onward', 'Also', 'Mutual', 'period', 'was', 'named', 'Chaplin', 'era', 'personal', 'professional', 'life', 'was', 'happiest']",N/A

267774,A1FDV3WPOHREY9,6301798457,"C. Scanlon ""least helpful reviewer""","[2, 2]","In the Woman of Paris, Chaplin wrote and directed a very early silent full length feature film seriously examining the loose life style he discovered in Hollywood, not so much in Paris. He dared not place it in the America of the time, and so relied on American prejudices about Paris to place his tale of love and deceit there. He cleverly presented themes in a way which might pass the censors of the time, including gently alluded nudity, etc. And he got excellent performances from his actors, including Mr. Menjou, who subtly at the end expresses that he too deeply regrets having lost the Woman of Paris. A profound and interesting morality play, which reveals Chaplin's intellectual and creative side beyond the vaudeville escapades which made him rich and famous before being exiled at the behest of the powerful studios which could not control him.In fact The King in New York directly examines the irony of his being accused of communism in America while actually practicing an overly successful capitalism which threatened the politically powerful studio system. It is like cutting back Tom Cruise's price tag by accusing him of scientology, but then it cancelled Chaplin's career and forced him to flee to Europe, at which point the US government refused his re-entrance.This excellent double disk DVD explores carefully these and other issues, and is highly recommended.For further study of the political persecution explored in the King in New York, take a look at the Front with Woody Allen and Zero Mostel, The Cradle will Rock about Orson Welles, and of course Goodnight and Good Luck with George Clooney.The King In New York also features a unique performance by Chaplin's own son as a radicalized young man spouting left wing opinions as virulently and mindlessly as the powerful right wing forces, although of course, far less effectively. Certainly Chaplin makes a point here about political rhetoric, a point rendered poignant by the boy's later utter defeat and humiliated regret at his betraying his parent's friends.But this is essentially a comedy, with some sense of the Marx Brother's Fredonia and much of Chaplin's mugging and surprising agility even in old age. The commentary and extras are mainly a valuable addition rather than a distraction or embarrassment as in many other cases.Above all do not miss a dedicated viewing of a Woman of Paris. Chaplin, early and intelligent, attempted something similar to a play by Ibsen, examining closely relationships of a wide variety: Fathers and Sons, Mothers and Sons, unsanctioned love, ideal love, commercialized love, commited and caring relations, commited but uncaring relations, etc. Read this movie as you would a serious romance novel of the period, as you might read Flaubert, or Joyce's Dubliners. Chaplin was reaching for a mirror of life that we might reflect, and learn from for our own lives. Chaplin here was ready to outgrow the popular Little Tramp comedies and write his best work. He included an apologetic message to his audience, which nevertheless wanted only broad entertainment and not high-brow reflections upon life and its meaning.Now perhaps we are ready for such fare. Liv Ullman provides interesting insight into how to view this film when she suggests we see it as a modern movie done with different technology. Modern movies should yet approach this degree of subtlety and sophistication, of insight and of philosophy. We might even say it is an early feminist film; it is certainly humanist.",5,CHAPLIN'S FIRST SERIOUS SILENT DRAMA AND FINAL COMIC POLITICAL JAB AT THE USA,1155945600,"08 19, 2006",2006,3500,"['Woman', 'Paris', 'Chaplin', 'wrote', 'directed', 'very', 'early', 'silent', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'film', 'seriously', 'examining', 'loose', 'life', 'style', 'discovered', 'Hollywood', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Paris', 'dared', 'not', 'place', 'America', 'time', 'so', 'relied', 'American', 'prejudices', 'Paris', 'place', 'tale', 'love', 'deceit', 'there', 'cleverly', 'presented', 'themes', 'way', 'might', 'pass', 'censors', 'time', 'including', 'gently', 'alluded', 'nudity', 'etc', 'got', 'excellent', 'performances', 'actors', 'including', 'Mr.', 'Menjou', 'who', 'subtly', 'end', 'too', 'deeply', 'having', 'lost', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'A', 'profound', 'interesting', 'morality', 'play', 'Chaplin', 'intellectual', 'creative', 'side', 'vaudeville', 'escapades', 'made', 'rich', 'famous', 'being', 'exiled', 'behest', 'powerful', 'studios', 'could', 'not', 'control', 'him.In', 'fact', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'directly', 'irony', 'being', 'accused', 'communism', 'America', 'actually', 'practicing', 'overly', 'successful', 'capitalism', 'threatened', 'politically', 'powerful', 'studio', 'system', 'cutting', 'back', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'price', 'tag', 'accusing', 'scientology', 'then', 'cancelled', 'Chaplin', 'career', 'forced', 'flee', 'Europe', 'point', 'US', 'government', 'refused', 're-entrance.This', 'excellent', 'double', 'disk', 'DVD', 'carefully', 'other', 'issues', 'highly', 'recommended.For', 'further', 'study', 'political', 'persecution', 'explored', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'take', 'look', 'Front', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Zero', 'Mostel', 'Cradle', 'will', 'Rock', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'course', 'Goodnight', 'Good', 'Luck', 'George', 'Clooney.The', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'also', 'unique', 'performance', 'Chaplin', 'own', 'son', 'radicalized', 'young', 'man', 'spouting', 'left', 'wing', 'opinions', 'virulently', 'mindlessly', 'powerful', 'right', 'wing', 'forces', 'course', 'far', 'less', 'effectively', 'Certainly', 'Chaplin', 'point', 'here', 'about', 'political', 'rhetoric', 'point', 'rendered', 'poignant', 'boy', 'later', 'utter', 'defeat', 'humiliated', 'regret', 'betraying', 'parent', 'friends.But', 'essentially', 'comedy', 'sense', 'Marx', 'Brother', 'Fredonia', 'much', 'Chaplin', 'mugging', 'surprising', 'agility', 'even', 'old', 'age', 'commentary', 'extras', 'are', 'mainly', 'valuable', 'addition', 'rather', 'distraction', 'embarrassment', 'many', 'other', 'cases.Above', 'do', 'not', 'miss', 'dedicated', 'viewing', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'Chaplin', 'early', 'intelligent', 'attempted', 'something', 'similar', 'play', 'Ibsen', 'examining', 'closely', 'relationships', 'wide', 'variety', 'Fathers', 'Sons', 'Mothers', 'Sons', 'unsanctioned', 'love', 'ideal', 'love', 'commercialized', 'love', 'commited', 'caring', 'relations', 'commited', 'uncaring', 'relations', 'etc', 'Read', 'movie', 'would', 'serious', 'romance', 'novel', 'period', 'might', 'read', 'Flaubert', 'Joyce', 'Dubliners', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'reaching', 'mirror', 'life', 'might', 'reflect', 'learn', 'own', 'lives', 'Chaplin', 'here', 'was', 'ready', 'outgrow', 'popular', 'Little', 'Tramp', 'comedies', 'write', 'best', 'work', 'included', 'apologetic', 'message', 'audience', 'nevertheless', 'wanted', 'only', 'broad', 'entertainment', 'not', 'high-brow', 'reflections', 'life', 'meaning.Now', 'perhaps', 'are', 'ready', 'such', 'fare', 'Liv', 'Ullman', 'interesting', 'insight', 'how', 'view', 'film', 'when', 'see', 'modern', 'movie', 'done', 'different', 'technology', 'Modern', 'movies', 'should', 'yet', 'approach', 'degree', 'subtlety', 'sophistication', 'insight', 'philosophy', 'might', 'even', 'say', 'early', 'feminist', 'film', 'certainly', 'humanist']",N/A

267776,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6301798457,Ed Uyeshima,"[8, 8]","Combining two of Charlie Chaplin's more inconspicuous features into one DVD package really attests to the fact that neither 1923's ""A Woman of Paris"" nor 1957's ""A King in New York"" rank with his classics, but each provides certain pleasures that only a master filmmaker of Chaplin's status could create. Neither touches upon his Little Tramp character, which actually makes his artistic achievements in each film easier to discern. For Chaplin aficionados, viewing is a must. For others, realize that these two films represent marginally lesser work from this genius when one thinks of masterpieces like ""City Lights"" and ""The Gold Rush"".Released in the UK in 1957 but not in the US until 1972, ""A King in New York"" is Chaplin's seriocomic indictment of the 1950's McCarthy witch-hunts and the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), topics that have come back into the limelight thanks to George Clooney's evocative take on the Murrow-McCarty feud in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" At that time, Chaplin himself was expelled from the US forbidden to re-enter the country for nearly two decades. The plot focuses on King Shahdov of the fictitious country of Estrovia, an exile who arrives in New York after escaping a revolution occurring in his homeland. In a manner that recalls a bit of Elia Kazan's ""A Face in the Crowd"" (also released in 1957), a shrewd TV ""specialist"" makes the King a popular TV celebrity thanks in part to a hidden camera at a dinner party. This portion of the film is pretty amusing, especially when the King does commercials to help gain support for his high-minded plans to harness atomic power.Unfortunately, the film starts to take a nosedive into polemics soon afterward, as the King strikes up a friendship with a precocious, politically aware ten-year old named Rupert, the son of labeled Communists who refuse to cooperate with the HUAC. There is still some Chaplinesque slapstick in this part of the film, but the contrived sincerity of the dialogue, along with some jokes that fall completely flat, weighs the film down considerably just when you hope it will take off into a more pointed satire. In his last starring role, a nearly 70-year old Chaplin plays the King jauntily, while Dawn Addams has a few sharp moments as the specialist, and Chaplin's son Michael plays Rupert with surprising aplomb. It's not the anti-American diatribe one would expect but rather a whimsical, sometime provocative film that progresses into heavy-handedness.""A Woman of Paris"" is far more of an anomaly in Chaplin's filmography. First, he doesn't star in this early silent film, although he does have an unrecognizable cameo as a porter. Second, it's a melodrama, not a comedy, except for a few passively amusing scenes with a masseuse. Considering that the film is over eighty years old, it looks surprisingly good with a consistently sharp focus and nice black-and-white contrasts thanks to Roland Totheroh's masterly cinematography. There are some tableaux-style shots of a Paris nightclub toward the end that are quite impressive. Chaplin re-scored the film music just before his death in the 1970's, and it provides a nice aural complement to the visuals of the often heavy-handed drama.The story is centered on a small-town French girl, Marie St. Clair, who plans to elope to Paris with Jean, a struggling artist. Through a misunderstanding, Marie goes to Paris alone, where over the course of a year, she becomes the mistress of Pierre, a wealthy, insouciant playboy Pierre. Through a party location mix-up, Marie accidentally meets Jean in Paris, where they rekindle their love. However, Jean's clinging mother disapproves, and there are melodramatic twists which finally end when Marie finds her true calling. There is not as much exaggeration in facial expressions or physical gestures as one would expect from a silent film, and Chaplin wisely inserts title cards only when they are necessary, not every time a character speaks. At the same time, the plot twists on rather contrived dramatic turns that make the story seem more dated than it is. The long-forgotten Edna Purviance, a longtime Chaplin prot&eacute;g&eacute; and leading lady, can hardly convey the frailty of Marie with her Rubenesque stature, but she does manage the mercurial character changes with a certain finesse. Looking strikingly youthful, Adolphe Menjou, who was to become a dependable character actor for the next forty years, is terrifically dapper and surprisingly sympathetic as Pierre.There are a number of extras with the DVD package that will interest mainly Chaplin aficionados. Some deleted scenes are included for both films but nothing that noteworthy. In half-hour segments, director Jim Jarmusch talks about his admiration of ""A King in New York"", while actress Liv Ullmann does the same for ""A Woman in Paris"". In various film clips, Chaplin is seen conducting his orchestra for ""A King in New York"" and appearing in a very old short based on Alexandre Dumas's ""The Lady of the Camellias"". There is also some home-movie footage of Paris in the 1920's.",4,Chaplin's Idiosyncrasies Captured in Two Wildly Diverse Semi-Classics,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,5076,"['Combining', 'two',

267777,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,6301798457,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 4]","A KING IN NEW YORK (Writ./Dir. Charlie Chaplin, 1957, 107 minutes) ~This light comedy with some deep (and deeply hidden) messages presents the viewer with a stunning and unexpected Charlie Chaplin as King Igor Shahdov of Estrovia.Having absconded from Estrovia with the entire contents of Estrovia's treasury, in order to escape deposition, the king thinks New York is the place to be. When he arrives, certain misfortunes result in his being penniless. It is then he turns to television and radio commercials--for the money.The sharp, witty and outright hilarious bits hardly assist in holding this messy film together. It was Chaplin's first film after his banishment from America--a subject with which I am not a great deal acquainted. The themes in the film, however, at times actual addresses directly to the audience, obviously come from a homeless, insecure place in Chaplin's heart.Chaplin manages to sort of spit out views on imperialism, capitalism, crass commercialism, Marxism and communism--which would have been much on his mind. Yet his insanely clever skewering of the television culture, so cheap and annoying, so recent and so offensive--deserves study by us today. He is almost like Orwell, pushing us to understand the invasiveness of such 'culture'.Also--on a deeply personal note--Chaplin performs a bit here, or rather a very funny spoken sequence, in which he uses the logic term ""reduction ad absurdum"". Never, and I mean never, have I heard this term in any film. We use it around the house a great deal being absolute geniuses--but to hear it in film, and Chaplin delivering it in a hilarious yet accurate context...wow!Though clearly not quite the equal of something likeThe Great Dictator (The Criterion Collection)(see my review), I wonder why this film is ignored. I had never heard of it and benefitted from it being available on Turner Classic Movies on demand. Weak as it is, I wonder why it never seems to be counted in Chaplin's body of work. Yet he struggled with this, at first hoping to reprise the role of The Tramp, then switching to possibly doing Verdoux--but his wife was against that move.Perhaps it is all of this which explains why this film is not available on DVD. These days it strikes me as willful, spiteful neglect not to have a film on DVD.Beautiful-but-bug-eyed Michael Chaplin, one of the Chaplin brood, adds tremendous comic zing as little 10-year-old Rupert Macabee, an insufferable and very political little know-it-all. I find it fascinating that Charlie and Oona Chaplin had so many kids: the legendary Geraldine Chaplin who is a perennial favorite no matter what language she's speaking, Josephine Chaplin, Christopher Chaplin, Victoria Chaplin, Eugene Chaplin, Jane Chaplin and Annette Chaplin...so many, who knew.I also thought it would be of interest to note the aspect ration of the film which is 1.37 : 1.This film, warts and all, is a true classic and I am so happy I discovered it just now--nothing was spoiled for me and I could watch it objectively. It made me laugh aloud like I rarely get to do and it reminded me that only Buster Keaton can make me laugh louder and longer--that's just me.

That episode of US history is so strange but also tragic that it should be remembered forever for the mistake not to be ever renewed in the future, though with no guarantee that it will be so. Unluckily in this kind of business there seems to be always a repeat and another repeat and a third repeat, without any ending. Charles Chaplin turns his own mishap into a comedy, with some very traditional but always lively and kind of born again gags and tricks. But he does succeed to turn a dramatic situation into a laughable short episode, though it means a child of ten is turned into a fink who exposes other people to protect his own interest, with no guarantee of any truth in what he may say, since he is a child, and with the certainty that he will be spoiled forever by the episode. This film, no matter how well-felt it may have been, will remain a testimony of that McCarthy period, mocked in his very victims that become Macaby. But we will regret that such a great artist was obliged to come to making this film to bring an end, or at least help to bring an end, to this sorry episode. We would have liked him to have reached his acme in political films with the Dictator and never gone beyond, but unluckily life made him write and shoot another episode which is just as sorry, even if not as bloody, as the previous one.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,It took a British Jew to express that much compassion,1181779200,"06 14, 2007",2007,1580,"['Charles', 'Chaplin', 'setting', 'up', 'own', 'troubles', 'anti-American', 'activities', 'commission', 'screen', 'quite', 'funny', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'episode', 'US', 'history', 'so', 'strange', 'also', 'should', 'be', 'remembered', 'forever', 'mistake', 'not', 'be', 'ever', 'renewed', 'future', 'guarantee', 'will', 'be', 'so', 'Unluckily', 'kind', 'business', 'there', 'be', 'always', 'repeat', 'repeat', 'third', 'repeat', 'ending', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'own', 'mishap', 'comedy', 'very', 'traditional', 'always', 'lively', 'kind', 'born', 'again', 'gags', 'tricks', 'succeed', 'turn', 'dramatic', 'situation', 'laughable', 'short', 'episode', 'child', 'ten', 'turned', 'fink', 'who', 'other', 'people', 'protect', 'own', 'interest', 'guarantee', 'truth', 'what', 'may', 'say', 'child', 'certainty', 'will', 'be', 'spoiled', 'forever', 'episode', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'well-felt', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'will', 'remain', 'testimony', 'McCarthy', 'period', 'mocked', 'very', 'victims', 'become', 'Macaby', 'will', 'regret', 'great', 'artist', 'was', 'obliged', 'come', 'making', 'film', 'bring', 'end', 'least', 'help', 'bring', 'end', 'sorry', 'episode', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'reached', 'acme', 'political', 'films', 'Dictator', 'never', 'gone', 'unluckily', 'life', 'made', 'write', 'shoot', 'episode', 'just', 'sorry', 'even', 'not', 'bloody', 'previous', 'one.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

I remember Michael Chaplin growing up and rebelling against his old man, writing his memoirs--""I Couldn't Smoke the Grass on My Father's Lawn.""  Then dying far too young, and perhaps the poignance of that early death colors my response to his performance here as the left-wing little boy who gets tamed by the House Un-American Activities Committee.The boys school scene, the juvenile delinquents popping up from behind bazaar stalls to pop spitballs at Shadhov and his ambassador--sort of puerile and not very amusing, but as soon as Shadhov meets little Rupert (at age 10, editor of the school newspaper, and unable to stop mouthing the left rhetoric he learned from his parents), the picture takes on a greater depth of feeling.  Previous to this it has been a fitfully amusing satire of US foibles in midcentury--rock music, body odor, commercialization of the intimate, but when Rupert starts hollering his impassioned pleas for social revolution, something seems seriously wrong and the King realizes that American has become a schizophrenic culture.  Later on, the boy is found outside the Ritz and the King takes him to his suite, drawing him a hot bath (there is an inspired pantomime scene involving stripping Rupert of his clothes, while Shadhov moves from spot to spot so the audience never sees anything of the boys' body), and he seems to soften a little.If there is a weakness to the film, it is that Dawn Addams, as the television presenter Ann Kay, is not drawn into the HUAC story with sufficient skill.  Thus charming as she is, she remains outside the disturbing political content of the action, and also outside of its real feeling.

Let's begin with his early feature ""A Woman of Paris"". After the triumph of his first feature film ""The Kid"" (1921), Chaplin chose to do something completely different. Thus was born this 1923 dramatic debut which Chaplin directed but did not appear. The public's reaction? It was not exactly a box office success; after all, who wants to see a Chaplin film with no Chaplin in it? Too bad. For Chaplin directs with a style & panache all his own (you almost feel as if he could be performing one of the roles), giving his players layers of expression & moods to peel away. The art direction is simply flawless & sumptuous. Chaplin allows touches of humor so the film does not become heavy-handed. The plot is familiar but absorbing: A small-town girl (Chaplin former leading lady Edna Purvience, quite a beauty in her day) from an unhappy home goes--via circumstance & time--to Paris, where she is inducted grandly into its extravagant social setting, and becomes the lover of a wealthy man (played by a slyly brilliant Adolphe Menjou) in a casual relationship. In short, Menjou becomes her ""sugar daddy"", giving her everything she'd ever want. But affairs of the heart rule, as time changes everything. She yearns for the love of a man whom fate had separated the two. Thus, she must make a choice: Embrace the life she had left behind, or remain in a comfortable arrangement with a man she doesn't truly love. As the story unfolds, misguided love, jealousy, fate, personal choices & tragedy all play their roles. The closing shot says it all: The roads you don't take can pass you by without you even noticing in wry irony, as our heroine has finally found a simpler & more satisfying life. I rate this film five stars.1957's ""A King in New York"" rings down the curtain on Chaplin's diverse career. Playing a ruler whose country has just plunged into revolution, he flees & takes refuge in the States. There, his sometimes delighted, sometimes bewildered king experiences the rowdy goings-on of then modern culture: From noisy NY nightlife to movie Cinemascope to commercials to facelifts gone wrong, Chaplin fires scattershot at all the satire he can think of. And this is probably the movie's failing; Chaplin often plays things too broadly. And while the satire is quite amusing (the alcoholic commercial, the king's horrific plastic surgery & the impromptu commercial insertions which puzzle the king), some of it seems outdated & too ridiculous. Amidst all the noise, Chaplin himself remains captivating: For a man of his advancing age, he's amazingly agile & graceful, still the ""ballet dancer"" of his Little Tramp days. Another performer to single out: young Michael Chaplin as the intensely passionate political ""original thinker"" Rupert, a boy who begins as sort of an obnoxious, unlikeable loudmouth in the film, but gradually turning into a figure of heartbreak when it's revealed his parents are accused of communism (this theme really hit close to home as Chaplin's own politics & opinions distanced him (in more ways than one) from the US while McCarthyism was still going strong during the 1950's). The film is typical of Chaplin; he was in such a position of clout that he tackled such touchy subjects as oppression, war, murder, and communism (we're talking about the man who had the nerve to poke fun at Hitler at the height of WWII). But because he was Chaplin, even his mawkish moments of self-indulgence were always interesting. Four stars for this production.Chaplin was never perfect, but his art endures because he dared to get to the heart of issues that went beyond laughter and made us think.",5,Dueling Chaplins: artfulness vs. self-indulgence,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,3745,"['two', 'films', 'are', 'Charles', 'Chaplin', 'lesser', 'known', 'works', 'yet', 'less', 'important', 'everything', 'else', 'great', 'man', 'done', 'Let', 'begin', 'early', 'feature', 'A', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'triumph', 'first', 'feature', 'film', 'Kid', '1921', 'Chaplin', 'chose', 'do', 'something', 'completely', 'different', 'Thus', 'was', 'born', '1923', 'dramatic', 'debut', 'Chaplin', 'directed', 'did', 'not', 'appear', 'public', 'reaction', 'was', 'not', 'exactly', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'who', 'see', 'Chaplin', 'film', 'Chaplin', 'Too', 'bad', 'Chaplin', 'style', 'panache', 'own', 'almost', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'performing', 'one', 'roles', 'giving', 'players', 'layers', 'expression', 'moods', 'peel', 'away', 'art', 'direction', 'simply', 'flawless', 'sumptuous', 'Chaplin', 'touches', 'humor', 'film', 'not', 'become', 'heavy-handed', 'plot', 'familiar', 'absorbing', 'small-town', 'girl', 'Chaplin', 'former', 'leading', 'lady', 'Edna', 'Purvience', 'quite', 'beauty', 'day', 'unhappy', 'home', 'circumstance', 'time', 'Paris', 'where', 'inducted', 'grandly', 'extravagant', 'social', 'setting', 'lover', 'wealthy', 'man', 'played', 'slyly', 'brilliant', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'casual', 'relationship', 'short', 'Menjou', 'sugar', 'daddy', 'giving', 'everything', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'affairs', 'heart', 'rule', 'time', 'changes', 'everything', 'love', 'man', 'whom', 'fate', 'had', 'separated', 'two', 'Thus', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'Embrace', 'life', 'had', 'left', 'behind', 'remain', 'comfortable', 'arrangement', 'man', ""n't"", 'truly', 'love', 'story', 'unfolds', 'misguided', 'love', 'jealousy', 'fate', 'personal', 'choices', 'tragedy', 'play', 'roles', 'closing', 'shot', 'roads', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'can', 'pass', 'even', 'noticing', 'wry', 'irony', 'heroine', 'finally', 'found', 'simpler', 'more', 'satisfying', 'life', 'rate', 'film', 'five', 'stars.1957', 'A', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'down', 'curtain', 'Chaplin', 'diverse', 'career', 'Playing', 'ruler', 'country', 'just', 'plunged', 'revolution', 'refuge', 'States', 'sometimes', 'delighted', 'sometimes', 'bewildered', 'king', 'experiences', 'rowdy', 'goings-on', 'then', 'modern', 'culture', 'noisy', 'NY', 'nightlife', 'movie', 'Cinemascope', 'commercials', 'facelifts', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Chaplin', 'scattershot', 'satire', 'can', 'think', 'probably', 'movie', 'failing', 'Chaplin', 'often', 'things', 'too', 'broadly', 'satire', 'quite', 'amusing', 'alcoholic', 'commercial', 'king', 'horrific', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'impromptu', 'commercial', 'insertions', 'puzzle', 'king', 'outdated', 'too', 'ridiculous', 'Amidst', 'noise', 'Chaplin', 'captivating', 'man', 'advancing', 'age', 'amazingly', 'agile', 'graceful', 'still', 'ballet', 'dancer', 'Little', 'Tramp', 'days', 'performer', 'single', 'out', 'young', 'Michael', 'Chaplin', 'intensely', 'passionate', 'political', 'original', 'thinker', 'Rupert', 'boy', 'who', 'sort', 'obnoxious', 'unlikeable', 'loudmouth', 'film', 'gradually', 'turning', 'figure', 'heartbreak', 'when', 'revealed', 'parents', 'are', 'accused', 'communism', 'theme', 'really', 'hit', 'close', 'home', 'Chaplin', 'own', 'politics', 'opinions', 'distanced', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'US', 'McCarthyism', 'was', 'still', 'going', 'strong', '1950', 'film', 'typical', 'Chaplin', 'was', 'such', 'position', 'clout', 'tackled', 'such', 'touchy', 'subjects', 'oppression', 'war', 'murder', 'communism', ""'re"", 'talking', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'nerve', 'poke', 'fun', 'Hitler', 'height', 'WWII', 'was', 'Chaplin', 'even', 'mawkish', 'moments', 'self-indulgence', 'were', 'always', 'interesting', 'Four', 'stars', 'production.Chaplin', 'was', 'never', 'perfect', 'art', 'dared', 'get', 'heart', 'issues', 'went', 'laughter', 'made', 'think']",N/A
267784,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6301798457,Randy Keehn,"[0, 2]","Of the two movies in this DVD, ""A King in New York"" is clearly the better one.  There were moments in it when I laughed out loud.  They mainly occurred during Chaplin(the King)'s exploration of New York City.  The previews at the movie theater and his experience at the night club were, I suppose, Chaplin's comments on how the Arts had commercialized themselves.  There were a few other jokes in reference to advertizing that worked fairly well.  However, the movie eventually revealed its' purpose as a condemnation of the Rosenberg Trial (Wow, I didn't see that one coming).  Chaplin gave an acceptable performance and I came away reasonably glad that I had seen it.  No need to watch it again, though.The second film in the DVD, ""A Woman of Paris"" was made about 30 years earlier.  It did not star Charlie Chaplin (who DID direct it) and there was even a disclaimer in this silent movie that clarified that Mr. Chaplin would NOT be appearing in the movie.  This was a reasonably well-made story of the innocent young beauty whose circumstances led her down the wrong path.  It is Not a comedy.  In fact it's rather tragic although it ends with an upbeat message.  The actors were unknown to me except for Adolphe Menjou who seems to have made a career of being a supporting actor.  The director obviously meant to create an emotional story.  However, Chaplin the actor was far better at creating emotions than was Chaplin the director.  Chaplin the actor could create a story with little, if any, dialogue.  Chaplin, the director, needed a lot of dialogue cards to set the stage and enhance the story.  Chaplin directed himself to much success.  That's because he had better talent to work with than he did in ""A Woman of Paris"".",3,Too Little Too Late,1222646400,"09 29, 2008",2008,1733,"['two', 'movies', 'DVD', 'King', 'New', 'York', 'clearly', 'better', 'one', 'were', 'moments', 'when', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'mainly', 'occurred', 'Chaplin', 'King', 'exploration', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'previews', 'movie', 'theater', 'experience', 'night', 'club', 'were', 'suppose', 'Chaplin', 'comments', 'how', 'Arts', 'had', 'commercialized', 'were', 'few', 'other', 'jokes', 'reference', 'advertizing', 'worked', 'fairly', 'well', 'However', 'movie', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'purpose', 'condemnation', 'Rosenberg', 'Trial', 'Wow', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'one', 'coming', 'Chaplin', 'gave', 'acceptable', 'performance', 'came', 'away', 'reasonably', 'glad', 'had', 'seen', 'No', 'need', 'watch', 'again', 'though.The', 'second', 'film', 'DVD', 'Woman', 'Paris', 'was', 'made', '30', 'years', 'earlier', 'did', 'not', 'star', 'Charlie', 'Chaplin', 'who', 'DID', 'direct', 'was', 'even', 'disclaimer', 'silent', 'movie', 'clarified', 'Mr.', 'Chaplin', 'would', 'NOT', 'be', 'appearing', 'movie', 'was', 'reasonably', 'well-made', 'story', 'innocent', 'young', 'beauty', 'circumstances', 'led', 'down', 'wrong', 'path', 'Not', 'comedy', 'fact', 'rather', 'tragic', 'upbeat', 'message', 'actors', 'were', 'unknown', 'Adolphe', 'Menjou', 'who', 'have', 'made', 'career', 'being', 'supporting', 'actor', 'director', 'obviously', 'meant', 'create', 'emotional', 'story', 'However', 'Chaplin', 'actor', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'creating', 'emotions', 'was', 'Chaplin', 'director', 'Chaplin', 'actor', 'could', 'create', 'story', 'little', 'dialogue', 'Chaplin', 'director', 'needed', 'lot', 'dialogue', 'cards', 'set', 'stage', 'enhance', 'story', 'Chaplin', 'directed', 'much', 'success', 'had', 'better', 'talent', 'work', 'did', 'A', 'Woman', 'Paris']",N/A

I didn't miss the sight gags since the story is so involving.  I don't think you can have a proper appreciation for Chaplin's genius without seeing A Woman of Paris.  It is certainly not a minor footnote, but one of the signal films of his career. Chaplin cannot resist his melodramatic instincts, and the plot veers off course toward the end, but for the first 3/4 of the film Chaplin manages to make twenties Paris come alive.  These figures from another era nevertheless have the solemn ring of truth, as Chaplin paints with a finer brush than he ever had in his career. It is sad that A Woman of Paris has been relegated to a footnote in Chaplin's career, and to a pairing with the totally dissimilar and in many ways inferior, A King in New York.  It is a wise, wonderful movie about the tricks of fate life can play in our lives, and about the particularly crushing effect life can have on women, who often are judged more harshly by society for making unconventional choices.

When Charles Chaplin was banned from the States, he was not the kind  of person to sit down and take it. He kicked back, right in America's  face.Not one thing Chaplin leaves untouched: Rock &amp; Roll, the  importance of commercials, the sillyness of face lifts and of course the  political system.

267789,A1K3NQAO49LXL2,6301798457,"Surferofromantica ""S.O.R.""","[1, 1]","I have no idea why these films are packaged together, as they have absolutely nothing in common (except perhaps similar-sounding titles...).A Woman Of Paris, 1923 &#8211; A very nice little drama film, in black and white, silent, full of drama, and only subtle pieces of comedy here and there (the woman using the saxophone as an ashtray, the wild parties with wrapped-up stripper mummies get guys to &#8220;unwind&#8221; them, to the amazement of newly-awoken drunks, etc). We see drama in the quiet village, people at odds, families torn apart, a mistress in Paris, and all sorts of shenanigans. We see the return of true love, and all that&#8217;s wonderful and frightening &#8211; attempted murder, suicide, over-wrought emotions, like passion, redemption, and true regret.World-famous since 1914, Chaplin here took a chance by directing something that was not a comedy, and which he did not even appear in. He had to prep the public mightily on this, as it was completely counter to what they demanded, which is more and more of the Little Tramp. In a way, Chaplin had disdain of his audience and maybe too much regard for his artistic talents, but to watch it today is truly fascinating, and there are many, many great scenes.In some ways, this was his first feature, after a career of nearly 10 years making short films; when it failed in 1923 he left it for over 25 years, then gave it a new score that he himself had composed in 1975, one year before he died; at age 86, that was his last finished work, after nearly 75 years in show business. Wow!!A King In New York, 1957 - Oh, wow, this movie is hilarious. Chaplin is a bit more ambiguous than his previous 1950 performance (a masterpiece) as Calvero in Limelight, but much more fun, playful, throwaway, sarcastic, biting, caustic. His first (of two) films in &#8220;exile&#8221; from his creative home, the United States, this film was shot in Europe (not New York), because he had been hounded out of the US as a communist sympathiser during the McCarthy era witch trials. The film offers some commentary on the situation, a great deal of irony, and many parallels between his real life and the character of King Igor Shahdov. Arriving in New York after being exiled from his country of Estrolia, Shahdov is immediately defrauded by his prime minister, and spends the rest of the movie making TV commercials (for Royal Crown whisky, no less!!), some of which should be failures but only make him more popular! Fame and success come easy for him in the US, and he quickly bores of it, as he sees it below him (true feelings?). He comes into contact with a 10-year-old anarchist, whose parents are Communist schoolteachers, and he&#8217;s drawn into the highly politicized world of government witch-hunting, even at one point being charged with seditious activities &#8211; they ask him, a deposed king, if he is a communist, which is probably the most hilarious joke in the entire film. The film is full of fantastic comedic scenes, like Chaplin&#8217;s grotesque super-smiles, the photographers who ask him for &#8220;one serious&#8221; (he indulges, sometimes with something Napoleonesque). Chaplin gives his message of love to the United States just as he&#8217;s being fingerprinted (WTF?!?). He and his wonderful ambassador Jaume (played to perfection by Oliver Johnston) go out for entertainment, the song mentions &#8220;rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll&#8221; (which in 1957, the year rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll music was emerging, was slang for sex).
