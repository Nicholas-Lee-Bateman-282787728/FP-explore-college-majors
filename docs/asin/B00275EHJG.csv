1253203,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B00275EHJG,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[1, 2]","Yeah, Thumbs-up. The sensitivity required of the writer when scripting a film for a young audience requires particular subtlety in dealing with darker and more adult themes. Add to this the factor that adults are more likely to take their children to see films that they themselves will find entertaining, the writer's task becomes dual in nature. How to make a film satisfy the simplistic narrative requirements of a child, while also satisfying the complex narrative requirements of the adult? Pixar has somehow been able to consistently answer this challenge while putting to shame the quality of writing for strictly adult oriented movies.Highlights included for me:Programmable military jarhead Buzz Lightyear having stick removed from his proverbial blackhole when on ""Spanish mode"" was funny.The evil bear NOT being redeemed because some people are just bad and that's life.The moment when they're like all going to die and they hold hands and accept their fate was touching. Ken...haaahaaa. Barbie's boyfriend(?) Ken voiced by -I didn't know it while watching- Micheal Keaton. I saw Ken described as a ""dandified twit"". Hopefully for Barbie he likes girls because it isn't clear that he isn't, ya know. Well I guess that doesn't matter too much since he doesn't have.... and oh yeah their freakin' toys. I almost forgot because the writing is THAT good. You believe in the characters like they're ""real"".Anyway, Jim Varney is dead and so couldn't voice the Slinky Dog I noticed.The ending of the film did elicit an emotional response from me and that also had to do with the fact that I recall when the first Toy Story came out and I was working at a Burger King and they were selling Buzz Lightyears, Woodys, etc. and that was a longtime ago. The kid in the movie was just a little kid then and now he's off to college like cousins of mine and I feel old.

You spend a lot of time trying to justify your stance, to be replied with vitriol and insults: it really isn't worth it. But believe it or not, some of us really didn't enjoy the movie, so this time I thought I'd spend 'a little' time and take a stance :0)I'm a fan of most of the Pixar movies, I think the Incredibles is a masterpiece, capturing the essence of the comic book genre as Ratatiolle understood the obession that cooks have with food, and Toy Story is one of the great buddy movies in any form. However, Toy Story 3, imho, ended up being a bad chase movie with a yawn ending, Cars was 'nice but dim' and I won't even start on how much I disliked Wall-E.Where I felt that Pixar used to research and understand the structure within which their movies stood, now I feel they have substituted substance for style. Yes they look good and are well made, but compared to Pixar at their best, I feel that their recent movies are shallow and lacking the inventiveness of their earlier work. Now they still have their moments: the first 20 minutes of Wall-E is great as are the first 30 or so of Toy Story 3, and I loved the idea of the Spanish speaking Buzz, but these are just a few good moments.Pixar are very good at what they do, i.e that generally get great reviews and make lots of money (which appears to be most peoples criteria), on the other hand the Shawshank Redemption was pretty much ignored when it came out and made very little money!I was really hoping that after Cars and Wall-E, with Toy Story 3 Pixar were going to get back to what they used to do; 'intelligent' well made movies, that are fun and still cater for young and old alike. Sadly for me Toy Story 3 ain't it!Now it may be true that I'm 'too old' to appreciate the movie and that 'it's basically for children!', but I recently watched Pinocchio and loved every moment.",2,Really not impressed,1288051200,"10 26, 2010",2010,1941,"['really', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'posting', 'reviews', 'lambasting', 'movies', 'most', 'people', 'appear', 'enjoy', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'trying', 'justify', 'stance', 'be', 'replied', 'vitriol', 'insults', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'believe', 'not', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'movie', 'time', 'thought', ""'d"", 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'take', 'stance', ':0', ""'m"", 'fan', 'most', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'think', 'Incredibles', 'masterpiece', 'capturing', 'essence', 'comic', 'book', 'genre', 'Ratatiolle', 'understood', 'obession', 'cooks', 'have', 'food', 'Toy', 'Story', 'one', 'great', 'buddy', 'movies', 'form', 'However', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'imho', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'bad', 'chase', 'movie', 'yawn', 'ending', 'Cars', 'was', ""'nice"", 'dim', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'start', 'how', 'much', 'disliked', 'Wall-E.Where', 'felt', 'Pixar', 'used', 'research', 'understand', 'structure', 'movies', 'stood', 'now', 'feel', 'have', 'substituted', 'substance', 'style', 'Yes', 'look', 'good', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'compared', 'Pixar', 'best', 'feel', 'recent', 'movies', 'are', 'shallow', 'lacking', 'inventiveness', 'earlier', 'work', 'Now', 'still', 'have', 'moments', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'Wall-E', 'great', 'are', 'first', '30', 'so', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'loved', 'idea', 'Spanish', 'speaking', 'Buzz', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'good', 'moments.Pixar', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'i.e', 'generally', 'get', 'great', 'reviews', 'make', 'lots', 'money', 'be', 'most', 'peoples', 'criteria', 'other', 'hand', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'made', 'very', 'little', 'money', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'Cars', 'Wall-E', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Pixar', 'were', 'going', 'get', 'back', 'what', 'used', 'do', ""'intelligent"", 'well', 'made', 'movies', 'are', 'fun', 'still', 'cater', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'Sadly', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'ai', ""n't"", 'Now', 'may', 'be', 'true', ""'m"", ""'too"", 'old', 'appreciate', 'movie', ""'it"", 'basically', 'children', 'recently', 'watched', 'Pinocchio', 'loved', 'moment']",Toy Story 3
1253207,A18BD98SU49UB7,B00275EHJG,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[2, 3]","I was a 12 when Pixar first created the computer generated, animated world of Andy's room. It was amazing, if you remember, watching the perilous journey of Buzz and Woody as they faced unspeakable dangers (including Sid's morbid in-sanitarium) as they made their way back to their bright-eyed owner, Andy. Buzz realizes that he can't fly, and Woody succumbs to the fact that Andy can have two favorite pals. Four years later, in 1999, the toys faced a new chicken suit wearing foe at Al's toy barn, and of course they succeed.Now, 15 years after their first adventure, our friends face their greatest opponent: An owner who has outgrown them. Andy has recently graduated from high school, and is now poised to venture into the world of college. Does he trash his toys? Or, is there a little piece of him not ready to let go? The answer may surprise you, as many things will in this latest epic from Pixar.I won't divulge any more plot details than I've already given you, as this is the center of the story. Toy Story 3 is a sad, inspiring piece of art from a studio we have all grown to love. I fought back the tears in ""Up"" and now even more so in this film. These little guys have been as much a part of my growing up as Andy. I secretly, even at the age of 12, wished that my toys came to life in my absence. Of course I knew it was impossible, but that didn't squelch the dream.Pixar has formulated a movie, which I would say, would ring truest to parents who have children who have, or on the verge of, leaving the nest. A moment of realization happens as Andy's mom walks into his empty room, and is stricken with the reality of her boy growing up. Maybe we feel the same about ourselves or others we have seen grow before us?I didn't expect this. I went into TS3 holding the usual grain of salt tucked firmly between cheek and gum, just in case I needed a good swallow, but I didn't need it. It would be easy, I guess, to detach yourself from these little guys and stand back and find a fault here and there. But frankly, I don't flipping want to.I am biased here, as a fan of Pixar, and as one who is attatched to the world of Andy's room. Call it what you will. In the end, I found that I too had grown up, and wondered how I had lost those innocent years as a kid building Lincoln-log forts and planning massive on-shore invasions with my plastic paratroopers. Where did it go?I guess, like Andy and our little friends, we face our next phases in life with renewed optimism.

1253226,AE9V37MS6QY8D,B00275EHJG,amerdale876,"[3, 5]","I've found that Pixar films are often like The Beatles' songs: they first premiered for kids but everyone can enjoy them - and after time and closer examination, you find that they're actually geared more toward adults; they get better as the years progress; and those who don't like them, you seriously question their taste. Sure, there's maybe one or two that aren't too favorable (for me, I compareCars [Blu-ray], the only Pixar film I'm not too crazy about, to ""Revolution 9""), but, mostly, they're all pretty much genius. I realize there are anti-Beatles fans out there who are cursing my words. To them, I say, ""Sorry, but I hope you know that whatever musician/band you really love, it's most likely they were influenced by The Beatles. You can't deny that The Beatles are a paramount in the music industry."" Anyway, let's move on ...The franchise that built Pixar returns to the masses for a third installment. I remember the firstToy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)being really good but I wasn't as crazy for it as most everyone else. Then, the sequel came out and I absolutely loved it. Over the years, I re-watched the first film a few times, and each time I watched it (like the firstShrek (Full Screen Single Disc Edition)), I enjoyed and appreciated it more and more. Like any third film in a trilogy, as a fan or someone who merely enjoyed the first two films, you hope that the last film is just as good, if not better, than the first two. Unfortunately, you're often disappointed. Even the sacred trilogies of the originalStar Wars TrilogyandThe Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray] films had fell victim to a bad/subpar final third act. But for those young and old fans of Woody and Buzz and all of Andy's toys, ""Toy Story 3"" will not disappoint you in the least!The brilliance of the ""Toy Story"" films is that it's not just a story about talking toys for kids to go ga-ga over. It's also a story about getting older and what that means to you and to those you care about, concern over growing out of relationships, building new relationships, accepting yourself for who you are and being OK with it, and moving on to what's next in life ... even though it can be excruciatingly scary. In this installment, we find the toys looking to find a place for themselves - and overcoming their own insecurities - now that their owner Andy is grown up and moving to college. Now here's where ""Toy Story 3"" shows its genius. In a trilogy where the human characters, although central to the storyline, haven't had much screen time, this film wraps up Andy's childhood in his home with his mom all in front of our eyes. And for any parent, whether you've had to see your kid(s) off away from home already or still have yet to experience it, it's understandably a bittersweet moment. It's that moment that will have moms weeping like babies, dads struggling to choke back the tears (even for me, who watched this scene with my daughter next to me), and those who don't even have kids appreciating the raw emotion and impact of such an inevitable moment in life.But let's not overlook the extremely clever humor that also goes with the trilogy and especially ""Toy Story 3."" Not only are talents like Tom Hanks (Woody), Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear), Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), John Ratzenberger (Hamm the Piggy Bank), Joan Cusack (Jesse), Wallace Shawn (Rex), Blake Clark (filling in for Jim Varney as Slinky Dog), Estelle Harris (Mrs. Potato Head), and Jodi Benson (Barbie) effortlessly bringing great laughs, but also newcomers Michael Keaton (Ken), Whoopi Goldberg (Stretch), Jeff Garlin (Buttercup the Unicorn), Kristen Schaal (Trixie), Bonnie Hunt (Dolly), Timothy Dalton (Mr. Pricklepants), and even baddie Ned Beatty (Lotso) add more humor that is subtle but hilarious without being too goofy or over-the-top - like most kids' movies nowadays. ""Toy Story 3"" has the entire package: drama, comedy, action, and even romance. But most importantly, it's got heart! This may sound hokey, and any film that tried to capture all of these different genres might come off as such. However, Disney Pixar has mastered their storytelling, and they have an uncanny way of tying all of these perfectly together to churn out some of the best movies (animated or not) today. Their animation has also emphatically improved with this latest release. In the scene where Buzz Lightyear's back panel is being opened and the tiny screws are taken out, when the camera closes up on them, the screws look like actual live-action, non-animated screws. There are several instances where the animation doesn't look like animation at all!One of my absolute favorite films last year was Pixar'sUp (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]. In fact, it's one of my favorite films of all time. With every feature that Pixar has released, I keep wondering when their streak of great films will end. I'm happy that they have yet to release a bad film. Even their animated shorts at the beginning of their feature films are great. This time, their short feature, ""Day & Night,"" is the best they've ever done - in animation and in story. It's my new favorite, taking the place of ""For the Birds"" which precededMonsters, Inc. (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy) [Blu-ray], and it should win awards. Overall, I would take movies like ""Toy Story 3"" over supposed hits likeAvatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray] any day! I've seen James Cameron's blockbuster and even though his filmmaking techniques were groundbreaking, the story was extremely predictable just from watching the trailer, uninspiring and trite (the story being a recycled product of several films, most notably ""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Pocahontas,"" and even Cameron's own earlier, better releaseThe Abyss (Special Edition), which focused more on emotion rather than special effects).Sure enough, Pixar has done it again! Their latest is sure to win an Oscar and I'd be surprised if it didn't. ""Toy Story 3"" is an enjoyable moviegoing experience, regardless of whether you have kids or not. It's a fun ride for all and not to be missed; this should be one of the films you definitely see in the theaters this summer!",5,So Great it Should be Considered for a Best Picture Oscar (and not just the animated category)!,1282780800,"08 26, 2010",2010,6300,"[""'ve"", 'found', 'Pixar', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'Beatles', 'songs', 'first', 'premiered', 'kids', 'everyone', 'can', 'enjoy', 'time',

1253233,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00275EHJG,Andrew Ellington,"[7, 10]","So, I probably know this movie better than the people there at Pixar (the curse of having a `Toy Story' obsessed 3-Year-Old) and I still think it's one of the best films of the year, easy (the BEST next to `The Social Network').  Why?  Well, for one it is beautifully constructed to excite and entertain.  It is a lovable piece of animated heaven.  On top of the obvious though, there is warmth presented within the films surprisingly deep themes that make this stand out as heartfelt and honest.  When you watch this beautiful movie you cannot help but become a part of the story.It's hard to come off of the success of films as wildly lauded as the first two installments in the pitch perfect trilogy, but somehow the folks there at Pixar made good on their promise and saved the best for last.Seriously, it's THAT good.The film follows the adventures of your favorite toys, Woody the Cowboy, Buzz Lightyear, Jessie the Cowgirl, Bullseye, Slinky-Dog, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Rex and the rest of their friends (which has been dwindled down to a select few over the years.  Years have passed since we last saw them and Andy, their owner, is now full grown and on his way to college.  The toys are devastated at the prospect of being thrown away, never to be played with again.  When an unfortunate accident lands the toys on the curb they take immediate action and donate themselves to Sunnyside Daycare, a seemingly magical place where toys can enjoy love and affection from kids forever and ever.Nothing is as it seems though.Yes, this film is funny, but it doesn't end there.  This film is also devastatingly sincere.  While no one watching this film is a `toy' the feelings and emotions presented by the toys themselves is so earnest and believable that one cannot help but find a piece of themselves within these lost souls.  The foreknowledge that you have been outgrown is a powerful message about growing up and moving on, about losing the ones we love whether it is by our own hands or by events out of our control.  Relationships in general are outgrown, and this film tackles that understanding with a depth not often attributed to animated films (I love Pixar for making SMART animated films).  What is even more powerful is the loss of innocence that is broached in the final frames, with Andy and his toys and their eventuality.  It is a beautiful and moving statement about leaving childish things behind but never forgetting the beauty that abounds within them.Yes, I was bawling at the end of this film.I will throw a mild disclaimer out there in regards to your kids and this movie.  The film is a tad scarier than the other two in the trilogy.  In fact, my daughter was petrified of Lotso-Huggin'-Bear the first time she saw this film.  He is VERY mean hearted and the way that the film is shot and his sequences done (with dramatic lighting and music) can be overwhelming for some children (there were multiple screams in the theaters).  That said, when all was said and done my daughter loved the film and actually saw it three times in the theater and we have it on pre-order, so you be the judge.  I just thought I should put that out there.In the end, this was one of the more rewarding experiences I had in the theater this year, maybe even this decade.  It was everything I wanted it to be and more; much, much more!",5,The best for last!!!,1286755200,"10 11, 2010",2010,3341,"['So', 'probably', 'know', 'movie', 'better', 'people', 'there', 'Pixar', 'curse', 'having', 'Toy', 'Story', 'obsessed', '3-Year-Old', 'still', 'think', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'year', 'easy', 'BEST', 'next', 'Social', 'Network', 'Why', 'Well', 'one', 'beautifully', 'constructed', 'excite', 'entertain', 'lovable', 'piece', 'animated', 'heaven', 'top', 'obvious', 'though', 'warmth', 'presented', 'films', 'surprisingly', 'deep', 'themes', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'heartfelt', 'honest', 'When', 'watch', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'become', 'part', 'story.It', 'hard', 'come', 'success', 'films', 'wildly', 'lauded', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'trilogy', 'somehow', 'folks', 'there', 'Pixar', 'made', 'good', 'promise', 'saved', 'best', 'last.Seriously', 'good.The', 'film', 'adventures', 'favorite', 'toys', 'Woody', 'Cowboy', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'Jessie', 'Cowgirl', 'Bullseye', 'Slinky-Dog', 'Hamm', 'Mr', 'Potato', 'Head', 'Rex', 'rest', 'friends', 'been', 'dwindled', 'down', 'select', 'few', 'years', 'Years', 'have', 'passed', 'last', 'saw', 'Andy', 'owner', 'now', 'full', 'grown', 'way', 'college', 'toys', 'are', 'devastated', 'prospect', 'being', 'thrown', 'away', 'never', 'be', 'played', 'again', 'When', 'unfortunate', 'accident', 'toys', 'curb', 'take', 'immediate', 'action', 'donate', 'Sunnyside', 'Daycare', 'seemingly', 'magical', 'place', 'where', 'toys', 'can', 'enjoy', 'love', 'affection', 'kids', 'forever', 'ever.Nothing', 'though.Yes', 'film', 'funny', ""n't"", 'end', 'there', 'film', 'also', 'devastatingly', 'sincere', 'one', 'watching', 'film', 'toy', 'feelings', 'emotions', 'presented', 'toys', 'so', 'earnest', 'believable', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'find', 'piece', 'lost', 'souls', 'foreknowledge', 'have', 'been', 'outgrown', 'powerful', 'message', 'growing', 'up', 'moving', 'losing', 'ones', 'love', 'own', 'hands', 'events', 'control', 'Relationships', 'general', 'are', 'outgrown', 'film', 'understanding', 'depth', 'not', 'often', 'attributed', 'animated', 'films', 'love', 'Pixar', 'making', 'SMART', 'animated', 'films', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'powerful', 'loss', 'innocence', 'broached', 'final', 'frames', 'Andy', 'toys', 'eventuality', 'beautiful', 'moving', 'statement', 'leaving', 'childish', 'things', 'never', 'forgetting', 'beauty', 'them.Yes', 'was', 'bawling', 'end', 'film.I', 'will', 'throw', 'mild', 'disclaimer', 'there', 'regards', 'kids', 'movie', 'film', 'tad', 'scarier', 'other', 'two', 'trilogy', 'fact', 'daughter', 'was', 'petrified', ""Lotso-Huggin'-Bear"", 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'film', 'VERY', 'mean', 'hearted', 'way', 'film', 'shot', 'sequences', 'done', 'dramatic', 'lighting', 'music', 'can', 'be', 'overwhelming', 'children', 'were', 'multiple', 'screams', 'theaters', 'said', 'when', 'was', 'said', 'done', 'daughter', 'loved', 'film', 'actually', 'saw', 'three', 'times', 'theater', 'have', 'pre-order', 'be', 'judge', 'just', 'thought', 'should', 'put', 'out', 'end', 'was', 'one', 'more', 'rewarding', 'experiences', 'had', 'theater', 'year', 'maybe', 'even', 'decade', 'was', 'everything', 'wanted', 'be', 'more', 'much', 'much', 'more']",Toy Story 3
1253234,A3EW4TUSY1HAXC,B00275EHJG,Andrew Mcdonald,"[1, 1]","Because it had been 11 years since we last saw Woody and Buzz on the big screen and the first two films were so awesome, this was to be the runt of the trilogy. Probably good entertainment for two hours but obviously a ploy by Pixar to squeeze as much money possible from their most beloved franchise while they still could. Now that I've seen Toy Story 3 I'm both happy and humbled to report that I was wrong.Like Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3 begins with a bang. Those who remember how the first two Toy Story movies begin should be able to tell immediately what's going on. After a little bit of fun lighthearted drama, we see a series of flashbacks through old videos and images of Andy playing with his toys through the years. We see that gradually he's growing up and when the camera ends and darkness comes we are brought to the present day. He is now 17 and about to go to college. Andy has outgrown his toys and while they have gotten used to staying in boxes they still desperately yearn for any kind of attention from him. Even being held briefly by him is now a moment to be cherished. These are bleak times for the toys and Woody, the unofficial leader of the group, tries to keep everyone's spirits up by clinging to any type of positive thinking that can be mustered. Only a handful of the toys from the first two films are still with Andy (many of them have been sold at yard sales and others donated). Despite being ignored, they still have a loyalty to Andy because he's kept them and are content with staying in the attic if that's what he wants. Woody points out that someday Andy might have kids and they might get played with again. However, a misunderstanding convinces all of them (save Woody) that Andy no longer wants them and they seek to be donated to the local daycare center. At Sunny Side day care center, these ""NEW TOYS!"" are pleased with their first impressions of everything. The toys seem nice. The kids seem nice. And the idea of not having an owner appeals to them. However, first impressions can be misleading...That's all of the plot I'm willing to reveal. Let me say that this is easily my favorite Pixar movie since the original Toy Story in 1995. It made me laugh which is not always easy. Ken is a welcome addition to the Toy Story family and, alongside Barbie, share many of the most memorable scenes in the movie. And Spanish speaking Buzz is even funnier than I could have imagined from the commercials.The villain of this movie is in some respects the most evil of all the Toy Story villains like Sid, Sid's dog, Al the toy collector, Stinky Pete, and even evil emperor Zerg! And towards the end there is one particular moment where his wickedness is fully revealed. Who knew that such evil could be in the form of a teddy bear that smells like strawberries!For a movie that took over a decade to get to the screen, it's amazing how relevant and integral it is to this trilogy. In retrospect it even kind of seems like Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were mere stepping stones to this movie where the big questions about children's relationship with toys would finally be tackled.Toy Story 3, in contrast to what a lot of critics suggest, won't make everyone cry. It won't even make most people cry. But it's guaranteed to melt the coldest hearts, make the sternest face smile, and, yes, make a few people sob. The ending was, for me, the best ending to a Pixar movie (even though it was borderline cheesy) and is probably my favorite ending to any movie since Shawshank Redemption's ending. Many people will say they were sad but I was happy because I knew it had to happen. The ending also makes this trilogy complete and, though a Toy Story 4 is not impossible, it seemed like the creators were saying to the audience that this is the final curtain call. Of course, if this movie makes a lot of money the executives might reconsider but for the moment I don't think there are any plans to do a ""4"".And if the day ever comes when they decide to go back into the attic and dust off these old toys for one more adventure, I'll be lining up to see it and expect nothing less than an awesome movie.

I wouldn't call Toy Story one of my favorite animated movies/series ever though, but I always appreciated how Disney managed to make a movie centered on children toys compelling in story and plot and how they made the characters come to life. When Toy Story 3 came out I must confess I wasn't too enthusiastic about it. I was expecting something that was a little better than the second, but not as good as the first. I was EXTREMELY surprised. This is definitely the best in the entire series!In this one Andy is all grown up and is on his way to college. He plans on sticking his old toys (Woody) include up in the attic, but after a mix up the end up at Sunnyside Daycare. All the toys excluding Woody are hurt and believe Andy doesn't want them anymore, but the forever loyal Woody isn't having it and seeks to return home to Andy even if it means staying in a basement and never being played with again for the rest of his life. Meanwhile all the other toys believe Sunnyside Daycare is the perfect haven, but...let me just say it doesn't take long for the story to turn dark.Out of all the Toy Story movies this one is surprisingly mature in all the right ways. I really like that because it's not one of those movies that try to talk down at kids. A lot of emotion was put into this film. Believe me when I say that I came close to crying 3 times throughout this movie, especially at the end. I haven't cried in a Disney movie since Up. In a way this could be a coming of age story as well due to how it portrays Andy growing up and no longer being interested in playing with toys.A simple review can't begin to tell how good this movie is.

I found several parts very humorous such as the beginning which is a western style action sequence and when all the toddlers come running in the classroom and ""play"" with the toys. Aside from the funny scenes there is a delightful cast of characters many of them returning from the first two Toy Story films with the addition of some new characters such as Ken and Barbie (who is voiced by the talented Jodi Benson who is best known today as the singing and speaking voice of Ariel in The Little Mermaid films and TV shows). Speaking of Barbie, she was okay, but I felt that she was not as animated as she was in the previous film.

This is one of the latter,and I am glad of it. Toy Story 3 is a wonderful ending to a great three part story and worth every accolade given. Woody and Buzz find themselves seemingly forgotten as Andy grows up and is getting ready for college. In the rush for him to get ready, Andy is reminded he still has his toys in the chest in his room and must decide what to do with them. When he starts packing them away to take to the attic, he rediscovers Woody and Buzz and decides to take Woody with him to College while the other toys, Buzz included will go to the attic. His sister, is also clearing out some things to donate to a day school and needs some help. In the process, the bag of toys being sent to the attic gets mixed up and mistaken for trash by their mother. Woody attempts to help his friends escape and while he is a little late, discovers to his relief that they have freed themselves but is appalled to learn they have decided to go to Sunnydale, believing that they had been thrown away. Woody's attempt to talk them out of it comes to an abrupt end when the car door slams and he is trapped and going to Sunnydale with them. When they arrive, they are met by Lotso Hugging Bear who assures everyone they have made the right choice and that they are in a better place. Woody however, chooses not to remain and leaves in a huff while the beautiful world the others have entered rapidly turns sour when they find the kids in the room they have been assigned are too young and too rough. Things get worse when they discover Lotso is no one's friend and rules Sunnydale with an iron hand. On his way home, Woody is found and rescued by a liitle girl and taken to her home and it is there he discovers what really happened to his friends and he is torn between trying to get back before Andy leaves or rescuing his friends from their terrible predicament. He chooses to go back and finds a way to free his friends resulting in an effort worthy of &#34;the Great Escape&#34;. Freeing Buzz, however has a seriously funny side complication when he returns in Spanish mode and in the midst of their escape starts to romance Jessie the Cowgirl. The escape is nearly thwarted by Lotso, but Big Baby throws him into the trash and manages to pull Woody in as well and when the truck comes all are taken to the dump and Woody and Buzz face their greatest menace ever When Lotso betrays them and leaves them behind to perish. This is a bit darker than the other two, but the story is amazing.

1253255,A1ZWDTXSH1ZV8E,B00275EHJG,B. Martin,"[1, 1]","The Toy Story films have become commercial and critical successes thanks in no small part to their endlessly inventive storytelling, memorable characters, visual and verbal humor, eye popping visuals and attention to the smallest of details.  But at the heart of each of them, including this stellar third installment, is a very real, very relatable human element--the need to be loved and the fear and heartache of beiing forgotten by those who mean the most to us.  How better to explore this complex emotion than with children's playthings?  Toy Story 3 tackles this issue even more directly and with less sugar coating than the first two films making it perhaps the darkest and most frightening entry into the series to date.  Yet the Pixar creative team have filled the movie with so much humor, heart and care and handle the sensitive issues of growing up, moving on and letting go with so much grace and understanding that the tears that will no doubt well up during the closing moments will likely be as full of happiness as with sorrow.Eleven years have passed since we last saw Woody, Buzz and the gang and during that time Andy has grown up.  He is now 17 and preparing to go to college.  His once beloved toys have been relegated to a toy chest where they still hang on to the hope that he will once again play with them as he did when he was younger.  Alas, this is not to be.  Andy has outgrown his toys (although it is clear that they are still very important to him) and he must decide whether he will donate them, throw them away or store them in the attic.  None of these options is particularly appealing to Woody and the others and after a misunderstanding that almosts lands them in the garbage, they end up at a day care center run by a folksy plush bear named Lotso (Ned Beatty) who convinces them that they are in the best place possible.  Children will play with them everyday and when they grow up new children will come in.  No attachments means no heartache.  It seems too good to be true, and it is.  Lotso has ulterior motives which stem from his own abandonment issues.What follows is an inventive, funny and somewhat dark prison break sequence that has drawn comparisons to ""The Great Escape"" as the toys must outwit Lotso and his gang of malcontents.  It all leads to a very intense finale involving an incinerator that ranks with the scariest and darkest moments in the history of Disney animation.  What's remarkable about the sequence is the courage and grace with which our heroes confront their most dire of circumstances to date.  Let's face it:  Toy Story 3 is not kids stuff.  But it's not a complete downer either.  It is full of fun new characters and inspired gags (there is one sequence involving Mr. Potato Head and a tortilla that almost caused me to pass out from laughter) and plenty of nostalgia for older viewers who will no doubt love seeing some of the toys that make apperances.Toy Story 3's final, moving coda brings the film, and the series, to a conclusion that manages to be both heartbreaking and optimistic at the same time.  It also speaks volumes about growing up, letting go and the need to have others help us through these passages with an economy of dialogue and a surprising lack of gooey emotional displays.  If only more live action films could get this right.  Much in the same way that our toys have always been there for us no matter what life had to offer, Woody, Buzz and all of the Toy Story characters have helped us understand how to face those challenges.  That is the magic of Toy Story.

With sequels, especially in the case of animation, the question is not if the sequel is as successful as its predecessor, but does it improve upon the original.Toy Story true to its humble story takes place years after the second installment, with Andy going to college. The toys have not been played with for years, but are still loyal to him. Even if Andy leaves, they are sure that they will at the least be stored in the attic. A conclusion that they are content with because all the toys will still be together. As these idea backfires, they are sent to a seemingly nice daycare center where they are promised that they will be played with each day. Though everyone is enthusiastic about having fun with children, Woody warns them that as Andy's toys they are responsible for returning back to him. The other toys who have found Any unfaithful, at this point, see no reason to dismiss this toy heaven and return to Andy's house and be eventually locked in the attic. As Woody leaves the gang to return to his owner, the bitter reality of the daycare starts to set in for our other toys.This franchise has built enough diverse and identifiable characters that it has no worry in enticing their emotions or through them enticing the feelings of the audience. In retrospect, these characters seem decisively well though out, even for Pixar. Their ability to make such characters and grant them such different, diverse personalities, while even maintaining stable romantic relationships between these toys. For example, gaze at the attraction between Buzz and Jessie, an attraction that does not seem obvious-for Woody's presence-but is understatedly fitting after close observation. It also shows Pixar's guts at avoiding the obvious Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head  pairing between Jessie and Woody. As a result, unless Pixar had taken an extremely troublesome route in approaching this project, Toy Story 3 would have still been the grand ending to a magnificent trilogy for the presence of these characters is gives the film's toys.Unfortunately, there is nothing new about Toy Story 3, even though many may persuade you to think otherwise. Simply think of the main conflicts and villains in each installment, and view the similarity between all three segments: In the first film, the main conflict was based on the toy-demolisher Sid, in the second, in the second film, the villain was the toy collector Al, and in the third, the enemy is another toy. On a superficial these villains may seem diverse, they are basically the same villain in different forms. In addition, each escape/rescue mission is nearly identical. Though these films are aimed to the younger generations, and such plot deficiencies go unnoticed, Pixar has shown itself more than capable in weaving complex and mind-blowing original works-with Wall-E and Monster Inc frontrunners.Toy Story 3 does hold up to its predecessors, but in the process shows the folly of the entire Toy Story Saga. As a whole Toy Story may seem complex, but with scrutiny it becomes clear that this tale of toys is relatively simple, at times oversimplified to such a degree that only the brilliant voice-over-work can redeem it from it abysmal condition. This is not to say that Toy Story loses its entertainment value after repeated viewing, a fact that many families would swear by, but it is among Pixar's least fascinating tales. It may be highly imaginative, and for sure the kiddies enjoy it for its whimsical nature, but Pixar seems unable to alter this film in such a way that it turn out to be more than surface entertainment-at least for adult audiences. Another issue with the film is its presentation in 3-D. With Avatar it seemed safe to say that 3-D had taken a turn for the best, but with Toy Story it takes an unfortunate slide of quality for the worst. 3-D is usually advertised as ""Eye-popping,"" but there is not one moment where this description fits. Even in the worst cases, 3-D at least grants the viewer certain depth in his or her viewing experience. When even the depth is lacking, what can be said of the 3-D format of the film?None of the films from the Toy Story trilogy can be regarded as the definitive Pixar products, but their popularity and critical approval proves that they contain the magnetism to win over youngster and adults. As many issues that this collective series may encompass, it must be admitted that the Director, cast, and animation are so beguiling to wash all these problems away, and present an enjoyable rides with our fellow toys.",3,Toy Story 3 = Toy Story 2 = Toy Story in terms of its antagonistic characters,1278979200,"07 13, 2010",2010,4919,"['ATTENTION', 'review', 'slight', 'plot', 'description',

1253258,A24PEJTGCOP13Z,B00275EHJG,Bookreader,"[1, 1]","In 1995, a new 3D animation film company called Pixar caught our attention with their first feature length film ever, Toy Story. Four years later they entranced us again with the sequel to their first film, Toy Story 2. Now, 15 years and 11 films later, they brought imagination and genius to the cinema again with Toy Story 3. I can say, 11 years to wait for Toy Story 3 was absolutely worth it! This is such a fun movie for everyone, not just the kids! Here is a short storyline intro to Toy Story 3.Andy (John Morris) is now 17, and going to college, and he hasn't played with his beloved toys for years. The toys are afraid they're going to be thrown away. And they nearly are, but instead they are donated to Sunnyside Day Care. At first it seems like a magical place, where the toys can be played with for generations. They meet some new toys, including Lotso, (voiced by Ned Beatty)  the old nice seeming bear who smells like strawberry's. And they also meet Ken, (Michael Keaton) a guy who lives in a dream home, has a room just to change outfits, and seems like a perfect fit for Barbie. (Jodi Benson) But then they realize it's not all fun and games when they're assigned to the toddler's play room, where the toys are immediately messed up. So they try to escape, and get back to Andy, who they realize still cares about them.So there's the first say, 40ish minutes of the film. (There's an opening similar to the other films, where Andy is playing with the toys and it seems real.) While the story is somewhat predictable, it is also a tearjerker for some, and it is undoubtedly hilarious to all. Now, there are some parts that are a little intense, that you may have to reassure your children that Buzz (Tim Allen) and Woody (Tom Hanks) and the rest of the gang are okay. It is most definitely a kids movie, but it also seems like they tailored it to the now teenagers who grew up watching the first two.This is a great film, and I seriously recommend it to all. It is definitely the best of the Toy Story films, and it is at least in the top 3 of Pixar films in my opinion.",5,We All Knew This Day Would Come!,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2087,"['1995', 'new', '3D', 'animation', 'film', 'company', 'called', 'Pixar', 'caught', 'attention', 'first', 'feature', 'length', 'film', 'ever', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Four', 'years', 'later', 'entranced', 'again', 'sequel', 'first', 'film', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'Now', '15', 'years', '11', 'films', 'later', 'brought', 'imagination', 'genius', 'cinema', 'again', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'can', 'say', '11', 'years', 'wait', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'was', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'such', 'fun', 'movie', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'kids', 'Here', 'short', 'storyline', 'intro', 'Toy', 'Story', '3.Andy', 'John', 'Morris', 'now', '17', 'going', 'college', ""n't"", 'played', 'beloved', 'toys', 'years', 'toys', 'are', 'afraid', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'thrown', 'away', 'nearly', 'are', 'instead', 'are', 'donated', 'Sunnyside', 'Day', 'Care', 'first', 'magical', 'place', 'where', 'toys', 'can', 'be', 'played', 'generations', 'meet', 'new', 'toys', 'including', 'Lotso', 'voiced', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'old', 'nice', 'seeming', 'bear', 'who', 'strawberry', 'also', 'meet', 'Ken', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'guy', 'who', 'dream', 'home', 'room', 'just', 'change', 'outfits', 'perfect', 'fit', 'Barbie', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'then', 'realize', 'not', 'fun', 'games', 'when', ""'re"", 'assigned', 'toddler', 'play', 'room', 'where', 'toys', 'are', 'immediately', 'messed', 'up', 'try', 'escape', 'get', 'back', 'Andy', 'who', 'realize', 'still', 'them.So', 'first', 'say', '40ish', 'minutes', 'film', 'opening', 'similar', 'other', 'films', 'where', 'Andy', 'playing', 'toys', 'real', 'story', 'somewhat', 'predictable', 'also', 'tearjerker', 'undoubtedly', 'hilarious', 'Now', 'are', 'parts', 'are', 'little', 'intense', 'may', 'have', 'reassure', 'children', 'Buzz', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Woody', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'rest', 'gang', 'are', 'okay', 'most', 'definitely', 'kids', 'movie', 'also', 'tailored', 'now', 'teenagers', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'first', 'two.This', 'great', 'film', 'seriously', 'recommend', 'definitely', 'best', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'least', 'top', '3', 'Pixar', 'films', 'opinion']",Toy Story 3

There was no doubt whatsoever that this film would be a success as the franchise had built up quite a following. Every adults inner child would have been screaming incessantly as soon as it heard the announcement that there would be a third Toy Story. I know I was excited from the moment I saw the teaser for the film and wanted to know more and more every day as to where they would take the story next.Andy (John Morris) is now 17 years old and preparing to go to college. Almost all Andy's old toys have already been either thrown away in the trash or donated, all the toys that are left are Buzz (Tim Allen), Woody (Tom Hanks), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bullseye, Slinky Dog (Blake Clark), Mr & Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles & Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and the Green Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon). They are worried about what will happen to them when Andy goes to college, will they be thrown in the trash, left in the attic or will Andy take them with him. The third option being the most unlikely. When Andy is packing his stuff, the toys find themselves ending up in Sunnyside day care centre, which seems like heaven to them all. Run by Lotso (Ned Beaty), what seems to be a heaven for toys turns out to be somewhat of a hell for the old gang and they have to find a way back home before Andy goes to college.I'm a massive fan of the original movies as these are something I've literally grown up with. The bits of adult type humour I didn't really get when I watched the films when I was younger, I enjoy watching again and getting new and more fruitful laughs. Toy Story 2 was shown on TV a few weeks ago and it was a genuine pleasure to watch something I had not watched for a number of years and still managing to be able to enjoy the humour and the message to pass onto the kids about friendship and loyalty. The message was strong then, and it's good to know that the message hasn't been lost in the 11 year gap leading to Toy Story 3, and is actually even stronger. The characters that were left are tied together, stronger than ever by the fact that it's only them left and they do not want to be split up, but in fact if they can't stay with Andy, they want a new home where they will be played with every day.The animation has seen a significant upgrade in almost every department. Lee Unkrich has commented that when approaching the animation for this movie, the makers have not approached it in the mind that it must look the same as the last two instalments. They animators approached it with the mind of making Toy Story 3 look how they would have wanted the originals to look, had the technology been as advanced as it is now. There's definitely an upgrade in look and feel of the characters and the atmosphere of the whole thing, especially with the human characters as it makes their story a lot more believable, and allows the viewer to invest more emotion into the story.The characters both new and old are excellent and create some hilarious moments. Possibly the best addition to the Toy Story cast was Barbie's male counterpart, Ken who's as camp and image obsessed as you would possibly imagine him to be. Lotso, the villain of the film was quite the typical villain you would expect. A mob boss of sorts in the setting of the day care centre, he's a toy that was lost and replaced as a youngster who feels bitter and angry towards the humans and the toys that play with them. Although I understood why Lotso was the character he was, I never really understood why he was so hell bent on keeping the toys locked up in the day care centre. Perhaps that was just a negative symptom of me not paying much attention to that part of the story.Overall, however, the film was truly splendid from start to finish.

The folks at Disney and Pixar are getting better and better, not only in the art of animation, but also actually transmitting true emotions though their films. This is precisely what I felt when I watched the delightful ""Toy Story 3,"" which I believe is the best of the series so far. And its gets better if you watch it in its amazing Blu-ray edition.This time, we find out that Andy grew up and is not a kid anymore. In fact, he is now heading for college. As you can imagine, Woody and the gang are worried about their future. Andy's mother tells him to think what he wants to do with his toys, and he decides to take Woody to college with him and store the rest of the toys, including Buzz Lightyear, in the attic. This apparently is a good solution that would make everybody happy. Unfortunately, last minute distractions cause the toys to be sent to the feared Sunnyside Daycare center, in which other kids were going to play with them. However, our friends' fears disappear once they find out that the kids there love their toys. Lotso (a stuffed bear), the toys' leader at the center, reassures them that they everything was going to be all right. But very soon after their arrival, the gang realizes that things are not like they imagined.""Toy Story 3,"" I believe, conveys a stronger message about friendship and love that the previous installments.

Mom""","[1, 2]","It's come to a pretty awful pass with regard to Hollywood movies these days, when the most sharply humorous, creative and character-driven escapade is an animated feature about children's toys  . . .  and the latest (and most probably final chapter) of three. Disney-Pixar just owns the family-friendly movie franchise by sheer force of creativity. (Well, and that practically every other studio of note seems to have abandoned the family movie-watching demographic anyway. Even if they hadn't, Disney-Pixar would still stand head and shoulders above the competition.)If Toy Story One explored sibling rivalry and Two wove a story of family loyalties - Three explores the bittersweet question of what happens when a child grows up and puts away childish things. What happens then, to those loyal toys of long standing when their owner Andy heads off to college? Is a box in the attic the best that can be hoped for - or as one character observes, ""Let's see what we're going for on E-Bay."" Through the machinations of the plot, all the toys but Woody - Buzz, the Potatoheads, Jessie, Ham, Barbie and the rest - wind up being donated to a day-care center. What could be a better situation, they all think happily; to be played with constantly by children? They make new friends among the toys there; the cuddly purple stuffed bear, Lotso, for one, and Barbie - who knew she was a strict Constitutionalist? - meets Ken, whom we always suspected was just an accessory. And Buzz Lightyear reveals his inner Lothario, too.  But all is not well inside the walls of the day-care center, and suffice to say that the cuddly purple bear is not at all genial - or well-disposed to Andy's old toys. (It must be a specialty of the Disney-Pixar house to have initially bluff, hearty, friendly characters metamorphose into menacing and manipulative ones.) It becomes imperative that the toys escape, and thereby hangs the rest of the exciting and ultimately poignant story.",5,"Poignant, Sweet, Funny and Satisfying",1289865600,"11 16, 2010",2010,1958,"['come', 'pretty', 'awful', 'pass', 'regard', 'Hollywood', 'movies', 'days', 'when', 'most', 'sharply', 'humorous', 'creative', 'character-driven', 'escapade', 'animated', 'feature', 'children', 'toys', 'latest', 'most', 'probably', 'final', 'chapter', 'three', 'Disney-Pixar', 'just', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'franchise', 'sheer', 'force', 'creativity', 'Well', 'practically', 'other', 'studio', 'note', 'have', 'abandoned', 'family', 'movie-watching', 'demographic', 'anyway', 'Even', 'had', ""n't"", 'Disney-Pixar', 'would', 'still', 'stand', 'head', 'shoulders', 'competition', 'Toy', 'Story', 'One', 'explored', 'sibling', 'rivalry', 'Two', 'wove', 'story', 'family', 'loyalties', 'Three', 'bittersweet', 'question', 'what', 'when', 'child', 'up', 'away', 'childish', 'things', 'What', 'then', 'loyal', 'toys', 'long', 'standing', 'when', 'owner', 'Andy', 'college', 'box', 'attic', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'hoped', 'one', 'character', 'Let', 'see', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'E-Bay', 'machinations', 'plot', 'toys', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Potatoheads', 'Jessie', 'Ham', 'Barbie', 'rest', 'wind', 'up', 'being', 'donated', 'day-care', 'center', 'What', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'situation', 'think', 'happily', 'be', 'played', 'constantly', 'children', 'make', 'new', 'friends', 'toys', 'there', 'cuddly', 'purple', 'stuffed', 'bear', 'Lotso', 'one', 'Barbie', 'who', 'knew', 'was', 'strict', 'Constitutionalist', 'meets', 'Ken', 'whom', 'always', 'suspected', 'was', 'just', 'accessory', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'inner', 'Lothario', 'too', 'not', 'well', 'walls', 'day-care', 'center', 'suffice', 'say', 'cuddly', 'purple', 'bear', 'not', 'genial', 'well-disposed', 'Andy', 'old', 'toys', 'must', 'be', 'specialty', 'Disney-Pixar', 'house', 'have', 'initially', 'bluff', 'hearty', 'friendly', 'characters', 'metamorphose', 'menacing', 'manipulative', 'ones', 'imperative', 'toys', 'escape', 'thereby', 'rest', 'exciting', 'ultimately', 'poignant', 'story']",Toy Story 3

The shadows and the colors were unbelievable. Then, the toys came to life when the people weren't looking and I knew I was watching a gem of long lasting origin.It didn't take long for the brilliance of the animators and the writers to bring 'toys' to life, not only on screen, but in our minds and hearts. We could feel their plite. They had a seemingly simple life: be toys, love their owners and do whatever it took to continue to be Andy's toys. We can all relate. We've all had to get rid of toys, or replaced toys with new ones, or watched Mom put our favorite toys in a garage sale, or inevitably outgrew toys to the point that if we were still playing with them... we'd be made fun of.Toy Story 3 comes full circle and brings out emotions that I challenge any film out there with human actors to top. The toys are plain and simple... LOVE. That's their sole purpose in life. To Love and to be loved. A valuable lesson to all of us. So, as they once again try to find out a way to continue to be Andy's toys, Pixar not only duplicates the heart and soul of the first 2 movies, but surpasses. Somewhere along the line, the characters of Toy Story became real to us.As we all relate to reaching out for someone to love and to be loved in return, it's the toys soul purpose and that makes Toy Story 3 all the more poigniant. 5 stars doesn't give Toy Story 3 justice. It has it all. Where most movies are trying not to be a waste of time, TOY STORY 3 and its predecessor's will be timeless. Toy Story 3 will be nominated for best picture this year and it may even be the first animated film to win.

1253278,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B00275EHJG,Chris Pandolfi,"[1, 1]","What has always appealed to me about the ""Toy Story"" films, aside from the fantasy that toys are secretly able to speak, is that they add genuine emotion to scenarios real toys find themselves in. In the first movie, Woody the Cowboy was threatened by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, a new, high tech toy that upstaged Woody's nostalgic charm. In the second movie, Woody faced the possibility of becoming a displayed collectable, to be gawked at instead of played with. Now we have ""Toy Story 3,"" and it follows its predecessors by introducing another unfortunate reality: That of a child outgrowing his or her toys. What's to become of them then? Sometimes, they're stowed away in the attic for sentimental reasons. Sometimes, they're donated to charities or daycare centers. Sometimes, they're thrown away. In any case, it always seems to end badly for the toys.This is the situation that Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz (voiced by Tim Allen), and their toy pals find themselves in when their long-time owner, Andy (voiced by John Morris), prepares to move away from home, ready to start college. After a series of missteps and daring rescues, the toys wind up at a local daycare facility, which by all accounts seems like an ideal place. Plenty of children. No emotional attachment. Lots of other toys to befriend. But appearances can be deceiving; Woody's friends end up in the hands of aggressive toddlers, who are clearly too young to appreciate the value and delicacy of the toys they're given. Worse still is a tyrannical prison system overseen by the cuddly but heartless Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). It's up to Woody, who was supposed to move to college with Andy, to rescue his friends before it's too late.While not quite at the level of their previous masterpieces ""WALL-E"" and ""Up,"" ""Toy Story 3"" still proves that the folks at Pixar are the real deal, masters not only of computer animation but also of story, characterization, writing, and directing. It's not merely a bright and colorful series of images for kids to stare at in amazement; it's an emotional journey for people of all ages, correctly founded on the assumption that even adults remember what it was like to be young, carefree, and devoted to their toys. It's incredibly funny, but it's also incredibly exciting, and there are moments of such wonderful sweetness that they bypassed my brain and found their way directly to my heart. It doesn't play down to its audience - it's sincere in its efforts to be both entertaining and heartfelt. It's also in 3-D, although I must admit, I'm finding the process less and less necessary with every new release.Along with Lots-O', a number of other memorable characters are introduced. One of the best is Ken (voiced by Michael Keaton), both a direct reference to and a parody of the famous Mattel Ken doll. His footsteps are wooden and jerky, his joints limited in their flexibility. He lives in a spacious Dream House, and he flaunts a wardrobe-stuffed closet that even Carrie Bradshaw would be jealous of. He, of course, immediately falls for the newly-arrived Barbie (voiced by Jodie Benson), who's cute femininity belies a toughness that Ken would be hard pressed to outdo.And then there are the toys owned by the loveable Bonnie (voiced by Emily Hahn), who Woody meets entirely by accident. Mr. Pricklepants (voiced by Timothy Dalton) is a stuffed hedgehog who fancies himself a master thespian. Trixie (voiced by Kristen Schaal) is a blue triceratops who seems to be somewhat of a computer nerd. Buttercup (voiced by Jeff Garlin), a plush unicorn, finds Mr. Pricklepants annoying. Dolly (voiced by Bonnie Hunt), levelheaded and calm, is a ragdoll whose look must have been inspired by Raggedy Ann.Most of the characters we've come to love are part of this new story, including Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Jessie (voiced by Joan Cusack), Hamm (voiced by John Ratzenberger), Rex (voiced by Wallace Shawn), and Slinky Dog (voiced by Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney). Even after fifteen years of friendship, it's interesting to see the ways in which their camaraderie is tested. Take Buzz; when a switch on his back is tampered with, he reverts to his old self, once again believing he's an actual space pilot defending the galaxy from the evil Emperor Zurg. Attempts to fix him result in a hilarious language-setting malfunction, changing his voice - and his dancing moves - from English to Spanish.""Toy Story 3"" could have easily gone wrong; sequels, especially those beyond the second chapter, are generally inferior, serving mostly as a way to continue marketing a franchise. Despite being the third in the series, this movie just as fun, just as charming, just as good-looking, and just as fresh as the original 1995 film. Should I have expected a different outcome? At this point, it's becoming less and less likely that Pixar will ever go wrong. The people there know how to make movies. More to the point, they know how to tell a story. They understand that even animated films deserve mature themes that adults can appreciate. They're technical wizards. Their creativity is second to none. What will they think of next? Something great, no doubt.",4,Who Will Play With Us Now?,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,5248,"['What', 'always', 'appealed', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'aside', 'fantasy', 'toys', 'are', 'secretly',

1253279,AN9J46667D80O,B00275EHJG,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[3, 4]","I must be getting more emotional as I slowly close-in on forty. It used to be that I never cried at movies or books. I still remember the first book I cried at the end of (Magic's Price by Mercedes Lackey, the book series that also helped me come out), and that was when I was 19. I was twenty-five before I cried at my first movie (Titanic). It wasn't until three years later when I saw A.I. - Artificial Intelligence that I did it again. So I'm not overly sentimental, as you may have gathered from this and most of my blog.But lately I've been crying like a baby at a bunch of different movies. Everything from The Red Balloon, to Up, to Where the Wild Things Are, getting me to cry at a movie is getting easier and easier. Maybe they're just shamelessly manipulative, or maybe I'm starting menopause.To that list of films that had me all weepy we can now add Toy Story 3. I'm not a long-term fan of the Toy Story franchise. I only saw the first and second one a few weeks ago when Amazon had blu-ray versions on sale for $30 if you bought both. I saw them and liked them, so I was looking forward to this newest version.Our film opens with Andy, the boy who owns the toys, getting ready to head to college. He's seventeen and hasn't played with his toys in years. These days Woody, Buzz and the rest spend most of their time sitting around in the toy box inventing new ways to get Andy to come open it and peer inside. This does not make for a happy set of toys.Eventually the day comes when Andy is packing up to go. He plans to take Woody with him to school and put the other toys in the attic, but due to some confusion on his mother's part all the toys end up out on the curb ready to get picked up by the garbage men. Woody, seeing this, rushes down to help and through a series of unfortunate incidents the toys then end up at a daycare center.Life there seems to be ideal, especially for Barbie once she meets Ken, but Woody's main concern is getting back home to Andy. He tries to rally the other toys, but no one wants to come along. Eventually he leaves as the toys that remain learn that paradise isn't what it seems to be.There's plenty of action and peril in this movie, a bit more so than in the others. In addition to a menacing purple teddy-bear and his creepy baby-doll henchman, there's also many sharp blades, a grinder, flames, and, perhaps most dangerous of all, toddlers. The resolutions to the various bits of peril were entertaining and satisfying, including one resolution that I'll describe as machina ex machina.The film isn't perfect (I could really do without Randy Newman's music. Ever), but I really enjoyed it, and the final scene is fitting, moving and deeply wonderful. This is one of the few movies I've seen this year that I actively look forward to seeing again, and while that's not saying much given that this summer has included films like Grown Ups, it is nevertheless a great recommendation.",5,Easily the best in the series,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",2010,2937,"['must', 'be', 'getting', 'more', 'emotional', 'slowly', 'close-in', 'forty', 'used', 'be', 'never', 'cried', 'movies', 'books', 'still', 'remember', 'first', 'book', 'cried', 'end', 'Magic', 'Price', 'Mercedes', 'Lackey', 'book', 'series', 'also', 'helped', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'when', 'was', '19', 'was', 'twenty-five', 'cried', 'first', 'movie', 'Titanic', 'was', ""n't"", 'three', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'saw', 'A.I', 'Artificial', 'Intelligence', 'did', 'again', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'may', 'have', 'gathered', 'most', 'blog.But', 'lately', ""'ve"", 'been', 'crying', 'baby', 'bunch', 'different', 'movies', 'Everything', 'Red', 'Balloon', 'Up', 'Where', 'Wild', 'Things', 'Are', 'getting', 'cry', 'movie', 'getting', 'easier', 'easier', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'shamelessly', 'manipulative', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'starting', 'menopause.To', 'list', 'films', 'had', 'weepy', 'can', 'now', 'add', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', ""'m"", 'not', 'long-term', 'fan', 'Toy', 'Story', 'franchise', 'only', 'saw', 'first', 'second', 'one', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'when', 'Amazon', 'had', 'blu-ray', 'versions', 'sale', '30', 'bought', 'saw', 'liked', 'so', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'newest', 'version.Our', 'film', 'Andy', 'boy', 'who', 'toys', 'getting', 'ready', 'head', 'college', 'seventeen', ""n't"", 'played', 'toys', 'years', 'days', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'rest', 'spend', 'most', 'time', 'sitting', 'around', 'toy', 'box', 'inventing', 'new', 'ways', 'get', 'Andy', 'come', 'open', 'peer', 'inside', 'not', 'make', 'happy', 'set', 'toys.Eventually', 'day', 'when', 'Andy', 'packing', 'up', 'go', 'take', 'Woody', 'school', 'put', 'other', 'toys', 'attic', 'due', 'confusion', 'mother', 'part', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'out', 'curb', 'ready', 'get', 'picked', 'up', 'garbage', 'men', 'Woody', 'seeing', 'down', 'help', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'incidents', 'toys', 'then', 'end', 'up', 'daycare', 'center.Life', 'there', 'be', 'ideal', 'especially', 'Barbie', 'once', 'Ken', 'Woody', 'main', 'concern', 'getting', 'back', 'home', 'Andy', 'rally', 'other', 'toys', 'one', 'come', 'along', 'Eventually', 'toys', 'remain', 'learn', 'paradise', ""n't"", 'what', 'be.There', 'plenty', 'action', 'peril', 'movie', 'bit', 'more', 'so', 'others', 'addition', 'menacing', 'purple', 'teddy-bear', 'creepy', 'baby-doll', 'henchman', 'also', 'many', 'sharp', 'blades', 'grinder', 'flames', 'perhaps', 'most', 'dangerous', 'toddlers', 'resolutions', 'various', 'bits', 'peril', 'were', 'entertaining', 'satisfying', 'including', 'one', 'resolution', ""'ll"", 'describe', 'machina', 'ex', 'machina.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'could', 'really', 'do', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'music', 'Ever', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'final', 'scene', 'fitting', 'moving', 'deeply', 'wonderful', 'one', 'few', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'actively', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'not', 'saying', 'much', 'given', 'summer', 'included', 'films', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'nevertheless', 'great', 'recommendation']",Toy Story 3

This is one diabolical plot and as usual the characters are very clever, the set-ups inventive, and the animation jaw-dropping.The Toy Story series, like most animation these days (Dreamworks, Blue Sky, Sony), highly references classic movies and pop culture. The difference with these three films is that it all supports strong characters who earn their keep. This third film expands upon the same type of mawkishness from the ""Jessie"" elements in the second installment, deepening its premise with an utterly sinister, fascinating villain who should be the envy of screenwriters everywhere. I was pretty amazed at the undiluted portrayal of evil, so much that I would really hesitate showing this to any kid under seven or eight years old. It was a bit extreme.The creative team also relies way too much on slathering on the emotion with a spatula -- something that I think was done with much more sophistication and delicacy in most of the classic Disney films. However, the issues and emotions they are dealing with do run very deep in all of us, and they tap into a huge reservoir of childhood memories and (somewhat shamelessly) run with it.",4,"A bit overripe, but still great.",1289606400,"11 13, 2010",2010,1261,"['thought', 'Pixar', 'might', 'softball', 'last', 'installment', 'Toy', 'Story', 'series', 'thankfully', 'not', 'case', 'one', 'diabolical', 'plot', 'usual', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'clever', 'set-ups', 'inventive', 'animation', 'jaw-dropping.The', 'Toy', 'Story', 'series', 'most', 'animation', 'days', 'Dreamworks', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Sony', 'highly', 'references', 'classic', 'movies', 'pop', 'culture', 'difference', 'three', 'films', 'strong', 'characters', 'who', 'earn', 'keep', 'third', 'film', 'same', 'type', 'mawkishness', 'Jessie', 'elements', 'second', 'installment', 'deepening', 'premise', 'utterly', 'sinister', 'fascinating', 'villain', 'who', 'should', 'be', 'envy', 'screenwriters', 'everywhere', 'was', 'pretty', 'amazed', 'undiluted', 'portrayal', 'evil', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'really', 'hesitate', 'showing', 'kid', 'seven', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'was', 'bit', 'extreme.The', 'creative', 'team', 'also', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'slathering', 'emotion', 'spatula', 'something', 'think', 'was', 'done', 'much', 'more', 'sophistication', 'delicacy', 'most', 'classic', 'Disney', 'films', 'However', 'issues', 'emotions', 'are', 'dealing', 'do', 'run', 'very', 'deep', 'tap', 'huge', 'reservoir', 'childhood', 'memories', 'somewhat', 'shamelessly', 'run']",Toy Story 3

For those who haven't seen it yet, three surprises stood out for me: (1) the high number of new characters introduced; (2) the darkness of some of them; this is not always a fun story; (3) the incredibly-touching last 15-or-so minutes.Also, the artwork is at the usual high standard, especially some scenes in the last half hour at the dump yard, of all places. This is a ""must"" for Blu-Ray.Finally, what's really cool, too, is that the people who voice the main characters are still the same men and women who did the first two films, with the exception of Jim Varney (""Slinky Dog""), who died in 2000.

1253284,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B00275EHJG,Craig MACKINNON,"[2, 2]","To wish that a movie is the last in the franchise sounds somewhat negative.  However, the story arc and resolution of Toy Story 3 is so poignant and effective that it can't be followed by a new story.  In short, the plot centres around a college-bound Andy who has outgrown his toys - Woody, Buzz, Rex, Ham, etc.  In a series of misunderstandings, they all end up at a daycare centre.  This is all pretty lightweight stuff so far, and not very interesting.  When they get to the daycare, however, the plot thickens as they discover it is run by a big Strawberry-scented bear named Lotso who runs the place like a banana-republic dictatorship.  Andy's toys are banished to the room with the youngest children who proceed to misuse them dreadfully (e.g. using Jesse's hair as a paintbrush).Many people have compared the film to the Great Escape, and indeed the best part of the movie involves the elaborate plan to break out of Sunnyside Daycare.  It also borrows somewhat from Bridge on the River Kwai, with Buzz collaborating (after being factory-reset) with Lotso's crew, and Woody, having escaped, returning to help his friends' cause.  This is the point where the screenwriters show their cleverness - Pixar films always work best when the stories don't simply set a human story being played by toys (or animals or cars) but where the solutions grow organically from the properties of the toys themselves.  Hence, Mr. Potato Head uses the fact that his parts still work when detached from the potato to great effect.  Barbie uses Ken's metrosexuality as a weapon against him to extract vital information from him.  And when Buzz is re-reset and ends up in Spanish mode.... well, that is sheer brilliance.  Their Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Story is well-earned.This is clearly the most emotionally loaded Toy Story, and is very intense at the end.  Certainly, my 5-year old was okay watching it, but my 3-year old was scared and refuses to watch the end parts.  That gives you an indication of the level of intensity if you plan to but this for younger children.  I don't think it's giving anything away to say there is a happy ending, but perhaps not the one you'd expect (yes, Andy goes to college and the toys do not accompany him).  Luckily, the end credits provide a very important (and funny) wrapup to let you end on a smile.  (In fact, I can't think of a more effective use of a song at the end of a film, except possibly ""Always Look On the Bright Side of Life"" at the end of Monty Python's Life of Brian.)Ultimately, this film may endear itself to me as my favourite Toy Story.  I'm not ready to make that decision yet (having only watched it 4 or 5 times), but it's certainly the equal of the first two films in the franchise.

It changed the face of animation forever and graced us with some of the warmest characters we've ever known. Toy Story 3 brings all those fond memories and adventures back home for us, once more.Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Time Allen) are still the personal toys of their beloved child, Andy. But Andy is all grown up, and off to college. Whatever is to happen to Woody and the gang? Only a select group of the toys we met in the original film remain in Andy's long forgotten toy box, which is brilliantly realistic, and they are all begging to be played with.When a final excruciatingly, disappointing attempt to gain Andy's attention and affection fails them; the toys begin to accept that they are no longer needed, and this crushes their spirits. It soon becomes blindingly obvious that their near future will be coursed down one of only three lonely and unfamiliar roads: leading them either to the attic, the garbage, or as donations to a daycare.Much to everyone's surprise, including Woody's - Woody finds himself the only toy in which Andy has chosen to take to college. The rest of them wind up by mistake, in a box designated the `daycare' box, by Andy's mom. Woody adds himself to this donation parcel, in hopes of springing everyone free from the no doubt horrible daycare, first chance he gets.Everyone but Woody seems pretty fond of the idea of daycare. And why shouldn't they? None of them were selected to go to college with Andy. The idea of new children in tempered with their youth wanting to play with all of them, is as good as paradise. So Woody leaves them behind to go with Andy.Ned Beatty joins the franchise as the voice of Lotso; a bright pink Teddy Bear at the day care, who's child abandoned him. Lotso is head of a gang of toys new to us, to include a Ken doll voiced by none other, than Michael Keaton!Somehow, Disney and Pixar have taken their divine talents in animation to yet another level here, and Toy Story 3 is neck and neck with Despicable Me for my pick for best animated feature of the year. I was expecting to have fun this time around, but feared the formula would become tiresome and the jokes would be recycled from the first two installments. This is not the case. From the hilarious action-packed opening, to the tear jerking finale, Toy Story 3 was one of the best cinematic adventures of the year!At one point Buzz has his voice-pack changed to a Spanish setting and at another Mrs. Potato-Head is able to see with her missing eye left while it's left back in Andy's room. Oh, and Mr. Potato Head has to improvise by using leftover lunch items to substitute for his plastic body when it's otherwise indisposed! These are just a few of the many hilarious moments the movie offers.Toy Story 3 is a treat for kids, no doubt. But it will offer them some insight on their feelings about life, and their relationships with the people in their lives, in addition to just entertaining them. It's a cartoon, sure - but it's written very well and it's gushing with moral substance; enough for kids and adults to both indulge in. You won't find that in too many children's films. And let's not forget the amazingly talented cast this franchise has in tow.What I appreciated most about Toy Story 3, that the first two lacked, was the amount of emotion we spill for these characters. We were getting to know them the first two times around, but as I mentioned early on; now - much like Andy, we've grown up with them.  Seeing them left behind by Andy, and the brilliant ending - ripped me apart. We really care about these characters by the end of the film, and we've enjoyed the hours we've shared with them over the years. But in due time, I suppose we all have to put away childish things. It's a shame, though.",5,Toy Story 3 Review,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,4272,"['TOY', 'STORY', '3STARRING', 'voices', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'Blake', 'Clarke', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'Estelle', 'Harris', 'Laurie', 'MetcalfWRITTEN', 'BY', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'Lee', 'Unkrich', 'Andrew', 'Stanton', 'Michael', 'ArndtDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Lee', 'UnkrichRated', 'GGenre', 'Animation', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '18', 'June', '2010Review', 'Date', '21', 'September', '2010I', 'was', 'only', '11-years-old', 'when', 'Toy', 'Story', 'hit', 'theaters', 'back', '1995', 'day', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'animated', 'film', 'changed', 'face', 'animation', 'forever', 'graced', 'warmest', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'known', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'brings', 'fond', 'memories', 'back', 'home', 'once', 'more.Woody', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Buzz', 'Time', 'Allen', 'are', 'still', 'personal', 'toys', 'beloved', 'child', 'Andy', 'Andy', 'grown', 'up', 'college', 'happen', 'Woody', 'gang', 'Only', 'select', 'group', 'toys', 'met', 'original', 'film', 'remain', 'Andy', 'long', 'forgotten', 'toy', 'box', 'brilliantly', 'realistic', 'are', 'begging', 'be', 'played', 'with.When', 'final', 'excruciatingly', 'disappointing', 'attempt', 'gain', 'Andy', 'attention', 'affection', 'toys', 'begin', 'accept', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'needed', 'spirits', 'soon', 'blindingly', 'obvious', 'near', 'future', 'will', 'be', 'coursed', 'down', 'one', 'only', 'three', 'lonely', 'unfamiliar', 'roads', 'leading', 'attic', 'garbage', 'donations', 'daycare.Much', 'everyone', 'surprise', 'including', 'Woody', 'Woody', 'only', 'toy', 'Andy', 'chosen', 'take', 'college', 'rest', 'wind', 'up', 'mistake', 'box', 'designated', 'daycare', 'box', 'Andy', 'mom', 'Woody', 'donation', 'parcel', 'hopes', 'springing', 'everyone', 'free', 'doubt', 'horrible', 'daycare', 'first', 'chance', 'Woody', 'pretty', 'fond', 'idea', 'daycare', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'None', 'were', 'selected', 'go', 'college', 'Andy', 'idea', 'new', 'children', 'tempered', 'youth', 'wanting', 'play', 'as', 'good', 'paradise', 'Woody', 'go', 'Andy.Ned', 'Beatty', 'franchise', 'voice', 'Lotso', 'bright', 'pink', 'Teddy', 'Bear', 'day', 'care', 'who', 'child', 'abandoned', 'Lotso', 'head', 'gang', 'toys', 'new', 'include', 'Ken', 'doll', 'voiced', 'none', 'other', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'Somehow', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'have', 'taken', 'divine', 'talents', 'animation', 'yet', 'level', 'here', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'neck', 'neck', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'pick', 'best', 'animated', 'feature', 'year', 'was', 'expecting', 'have', 'fun', 'time', 'around', 'feared', 'formula', 'would', 'become', 'tiresome', 'jokes', 'would', 'be', 'recycled', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'not', 'case', 'hilarious', 'action-packed', 'opening', 'tear', 'jerking', 'finale', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'adventures', 'year', 'one', 'point', 'Buzz', 'voice-pack', 'changed', 'Spanish', 'setting', 'Mrs.', 'Potato-Head', 'able', 'see', 'missing', 'eye', 'left', 'left', 'back', 'Andy', 'room', 'Oh', 'Mr', 'Potato', 'Head', 'improvise', 'using', 'leftover', 'lunch', 'items', 'substitute', 'plastic', 'body', 'when', 'otherwise', 'indisposed', 'are', 'just', 'few', 'many', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'movie', 'Story', '3', 'treat', 'kids', 'doubt', 'will', 'offer', 'insight', 'feelings', 'life', 'relationships', 'people', 'lives', 'addition', 'just', 'entertaining', 'cartoon', 'sure', 'written', 'very', 'well', 'gushing', 'moral', 'substance', 'enough', 'kids', 'adults', 'indulge', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'many', 'children', 'films', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'amazingly', 'talented', 'cast', 'franchise', 'tow.What', 'appreciated', 'most', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'first', 'two', 'lacked', 'was', 'amount', 'emotion', 'spill', 'characters', 'were', 'getting', 'know', 'first', 'two', 'times', 'mentioned', 'early', 'now', 'much', 'Andy', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'Seeing', 'left', 'Andy', 'brilliant', 'ending', 'ripped', 'apart', 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'hours', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'years', 'due', 'time', 'suppose', 'have', 'put', 'away', 'childish', 'things', 'shame', 'though']",Toy Story 3

Not many people can claim that there isn't at least one Pixar film in their delightful repertoire that they don't feel strongly about or hasn't moved them in the slightest. But as much as I adore Pixar and as admirable and enjoyable as Toy Story is for introducing the world to a wonderful animation studio, I didn't love the first two films quite as much as most do. I was under the impression I'd feel the same way about Toy Story 3, but luckily I was wrong.Something has to be said about the ""Day & Night"" short that played before Toy Story 3. It was spectacular. Pixar has always been fantastically imaginative anyway, but ""Day & Night"" is one of the most original animated shorts I've ever had the pleasure of sitting though. A truly brilliant piece of animation.My mom used to make a career out of making and selling teddy bears, so toys, action figures, and stuffed animals have pretty much always been a part of my life in some capacity. It seemed like we'd always find her bears in spots where we didn't leave them and in positions we didn't remember leaving them in, so we came up with this story that they were alive and would throw parties when we weren't in the room. Everybody played with toys growing up and that's one of the reasons why the Toy Story films are so easy to relate to. Toy Story 3 makes you realize how much you love these characters you've been spending the better part of 15 years getting to know. You don't want to see their adventures end. The fact that Pixar is capable of making its audience care so much about CG animated characters that are made of plastic or whose insides are nothing more than stuffing is extraordinary in itself.Toy Story 3 not only lives up to the first two films, but surpasses them entirely. The third film throws you into this ingenious world where you're just immersed in originality and creativity. Not that the first two films didn't already establish that, but you lose yourself and get sucked in much quicker this time around.Toy Story 3 may not just be a movie of the year candidate, but it might be the most satisfying third film in a franchise ever. It manages to introduce new characters that you grow to care about by the end of the film while effectively ending the story between Andy and his toys. The sequel lives up to Pixar's reputation for being incredibly moving and heartfelt. Toy Story 3 has everything and appeals to all ages. I'm going to go on record as saying that Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story film to date and easily the best film of the first six months of 2010.",5,Genuinely spectacular,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",2010,2594,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Pixar', 'who', ""n't"", 'Not', 'many', 'people', 'can', 'claim', ""n't"", 'least', 'one', 'Pixar', 'film', 'delightful', 'repertoire', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'strongly', ""n't"", 'moved', 'slightest', 'as', 'much', 'adore', 'Pixar', 'admirable', 'enjoyable', 'Toy', 'Story', 'introducing', 'world', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'studio', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'quite', 'as', 'much', 'most', 'do', 'was', 'impression', ""'d"", 'feel', 'same', 'way', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'luckily', 'was', 'wrong.Something', 'be', 'said', 'Day', 'Night', 'short', 'played', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'was', 'spectacular', 'Pixar', 'always', 'been', 'fantastically', 'imaginative', 'anyway', 'Day', 'Night', 'one', 'most', 'original', 'animated', 'shorts', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'had', 'pleasure', 'sitting', 'truly', 'brilliant', 'piece', 'animation.My', 'mom', 'used', 'make', 'career', 'making', 'selling', 'teddy', 'bears', 'so', 'toys', 'action', 'figures', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'have', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'been', 'part', 'life', 'capacity', 'seemed', ""'d"", 'always', 'find', 'bears', 'spots', 'where', 'did', ""n't"", 'leave', 'positions', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'leaving', 'came', 'up', 'story', 'were', 'alive', 'would', 'throw', 'parties', 'when', 'were', ""n't"", 'room', 'Everybody', 'played', 'toys', 'growing', 'up', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'are', 'so', 'easy', 'relate', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'realize', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'been', 'spending', 'better', 'part', '15', 'years', 'getting', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'adventures', 'end', 'fact', 'Pixar', 'capable', 'making', 'audience', 'care', 'so', 'much', 'CG', 'animated', 'characters', 'are', 'made', 'plastic', 'insides', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'stuffing', 'extraordinary', 'itself.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'not', 'only', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'entirely', 'third', 'film', 'ingenious', 'world', 'where', ""'re"", 'just', 'immersed', 'originality', 'creativity', 'Not', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'establish', 'lose', 'get', 'sucked', 'much', 'quicker', 'time', 'Story', '3', 'may', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'movie', 'year', 'candidate', 'might', 'be', 'most', 'satisfying', 'third', 'film', 'franchise', 'ever', 'introduce', 'new', 'characters', 'grow', 'care', 'end', 'film', 'effectively', 'ending', 'story', 'Andy', 'toys', 'sequel', 'up', 'Pixar', 'reputation', 'being', 'incredibly', 'moving', 'heartfelt', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'everything', 'appeals', 'ages', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'record', 'saying', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'best', 'Toy', 'Story', 'film', 'date', 'easily', 'best', 'film', 'first', 'six', 'months', '2010']",Toy Story 3
1253287,A77184QJM3PM,B00275EHJG,"C. Tolley ""Chris Tolley""","[2, 2]","I have been looking forward to a third installment in the Toy Story series ever since the second film came out. The first two films were funny, endearing, and original masterpieces, and I could only hope and pray that A. they would make a third, and that B. it would be at least half as good as the first two. Well bless those geniuses at Pixar, they went for a third movie with our favs from the toy box, and they gave us a film that can proudly stand alongside the first two. Some of the original toys are missing in this one, and a moment near the beginning settles the fate of those missing toys, but the main characters are here, and most of them are freaking now that Andy is about to start college. Gloom, doom and despair, they're headed for the attic, or worse, the land-fill. Due to a mix-up, the toys find themsleves donated to a day-care, which is what you would think that toys would consider heaven. It turns out to be just the opposite, and that's when the interesting stuff really starts. The pace is kept tight, with only a slight drag here and there, with lots of adult nods and winks, and laughs galore. The animation is superb, as is usual with Pixar. I am of the very firm opinion that Pixar is the real and true home of the computer animated film, and all others are just wanna-bees ( yes, even the Shrek series). How Pixar continues to turn out quality film after quality film each and every time is amazing. As I said, the pace is good, and gets more intense towards the end. Actually, I noted several people squirmed a bit in a key part in the land-fill, so the intensity was a bit surprising. However, the ending was pure magic. There is a fine line between heavy-handed sentimentality and pulling the heart strings enough to get a reaction, and Pixar has it down pat. The ending is just right, and leaves the door open for a possible fourth film (which would be GREAT). All in all, this movie kind of surprised me. I knew I'd like it, but it was better than it had to be. That's another thing Pixar is good at.",5,When kids grow up,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,2037,"['have', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'third', 'installment', 'Toy', 'Story', 'series', 'ever', 'second', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'were', 'funny', 'endearing', 'original', 'masterpieces', 'could', 'only', 'hope', 'pray', 'A.', 'would', 'make', 'third', 'B.', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'Well', 'geniuses', 'Pixar', 'went', 'third', 'movie', 'favs', 'toy', 'box', 'gave', 'film', 'can', 'proudly', 'stand', 'first', 'two', 'original', 'toys', 'are', 'missing', 'one', 'moment', 'beginning', 'fate', 'missing', 'toys', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'here', 'most', 'are', 'freaking', 'now', 'Andy', 'start', 'college', 'Gloom', 'doom', 'despair', ""'re"", 'headed', 'attic', 'worse', 'land-fill', 'Due', 'mix-up', 'toys', 'find', 'themsleves', 'donated', 'day-care', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'toys', 'would', 'consider', 'heaven', 'out', 'be', 'just', 'opposite', 'when', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'really', 'pace', 'kept', 'tight', 'only', 'slight', 'drag', 'here', 'there', 'lots', 'adult', 'nods', 'winks', 'galore', 'animation', 'superb', 'usual', 'Pixar', 'am', 'very', 'firm', 'opinion', 'Pixar', 'real', 'true', 'home', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'others', 'are', 'just', 'wanna-bees', 'yes', 'even', 'Shrek', 'series', 'How', 'Pixar', 'turn', 'out', 'quality', 'film', 'quality', 'film', 'time', 'amazing', 'said', 'pace', 'good', 'more', 'intense', 'end', 'Actually', 'noted', 'several', 'people', 'squirmed', 'bit', 'key', 'part', 'land-fill', 'intensity', 'was', 'bit', 'surprising', 'However', 'ending', 'was', 'pure', 'magic', 'fine', 'line', 'heavy-handed', 'sentimentality', 'pulling', 'heart', 'enough', 'get', 'reaction', 'Pixar', 'down', 'pat', 'ending', 'just', 'right', 'door', 'open', 'possible', 'fourth', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'GREAT', 'movie', 'kind', 'surprised', 'knew', ""'d"", 'like', 'was', 'better', 'had', 'be', 'thing', 'Pixar', 'good']",Toy Story 3
1253288,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B00275EHJG,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[1, 2]","Completing one of the greatest trilogies in movie history (joining Star Wars and Lord of the Rings), Toy Story 3 is everything one could wish for and more.  These familiar toys that come alive with feelings and interplay became the cornerstone of Pixar Studios and a string of superlative animated gems.  Disney should be thanking its lucky stars.Picking up from the previous films, Andy has played with his beloved toys for years and explored imaginative adventures and thrills that are the stuff of a rich, wondrous childhood.  The old gang is back with Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and the others.  As Andy approaches college age, it is a time of change, and the toys lament at not being played with anymore.  They are destined for the attic or the trash dump... or maybe a chance to entertain kids at a day school.  Lest you think the field of toys gets too crowded (Little Bo Peep and Etch a Sketch have moved on), there are some nice additions (Barbie doll gets to romance Ken), and some not so nice ones.Sunnyside Daycare seems to be an ideal situation with children who want toys, and toys needing to be needed (a kind of schoolyard version of `The Island of Misfit Toys'); it appears to be a match made in heaven.  There's even a connection between Andy and a daycare staffer whose daughter, Bonnie, is beginning to play with her first toys.  But a mysterious leader emerges in the form of a stuffed bear, Lotso (a charming Ned Beatty), who has a rigid pecking order or hierarchy for the toys, and that leaves our newcomers at the mercy of the youngest, most violent kids who abuse them.As Woody finds a temporary home with Bonnie and tries to make it back to his friends, Buzz attempts to find out the truth of the daycare and is captured.  From there, the film becomes an escape story as the toys struggle to flee their daycare prison. Last minute rescues are trumped by surprises and betrayal, and salvation can come from the most surprising source.  Will Woody and Buzz save the day, and what will become of their toy brethren?  Will the toys find happiness somewhere perhaps?What has never failed is that the filmmakers treat their audience with intelligence and respect.  It also does not depend on one seeing the past films, but it does help in order to appreciate certain references.  The Pixar team led by director Lee Unkrich and screenwriter Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) should be commended for never losing sight of the story.  The cast of voices including Joan Cusack, Don Rickles (priceless as Mr. Potato Head), Estelle Harris, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger (who has voiced in every Pixar film), and newcomer Michael Keaton (as Ken) are terrific.  They do a better job of acting and emoting than many a live actor.The film's first hour or so is good but not great.  It is in the final scenes that the themes of loyalty and sacrifice take on a deeper meaning, and the film blossoms with pathos.  The notion of abandonment and wanting to belong resonate universally.  As the toys learn that they can make other children happy and feel a purpose again, Andy also learns a lesson in life: passing the torch from one child's happiness to another.  It's about growing up and letting go while finding closure amidst a time of uncertainty and change. Imagine that-a kid's film that is affecting to adults!If this is the end of the precious series (with record box office grosses, I find that hard to believe), it has ended on a very high note.

However, I find all three of these films equally wonderful. With that being said, let me get back to this newest sequel. The imagination involved here is nothing short of amazing. All our favorite toys are back, along with new ones, friends ""and"" foes. The one that really made me laugh aloud was Ken, voiced by Michael Keaton. As a child, we all thought of Ken as a girl or sissy toy. Especially, those of us who had GI Joe, Mego DC/ Marvel heroes, or even Planet Of The Ape figures (*yes, I'm a gettin' old*) Funny thing is that this movie brought me back to those younger years when Ken was quite controversialamongst the ""Six Millon Dollar Man"" action figure croud. And seeing him examined ~ so closely for the first time in media ~ was what I found so funny. The irony of Ken is that he has always scored the hottest doll ever, while most boys thought he was (is) gay. Anyway, most of the reviews here shall flesh out this instant classic.

1253295,A12SHC9IT3VZQG,B00275EHJG,Daniel Sweeney,"[43, 295]","I entered Toy Story 3 with high expectations and guarded optimism. I love these movies and I really wanted this one to be good. It starts promisingly with a playful but derivative sequence (a bit too similar to the ""video game"" opening of Toy Story 2) and that should have been a warning right there that something was off. As the film continued I remained a disinterested viewer (against my will) as I watched these wonderful characters subjected to scenarios and plot devices they seemingly had little control over and I began to realize the disappointing truth: Toy Story 3 is fool's gold not worthy of it's pedigree.The previous installments were all about the characters, which used to be a Pixar hallmark; it was the characters that dictated the action and propelled the story. In the case of Toy Story 3 the opposite is true--the plot dictates the action and our heroes become almost interchangeable and arbitrary as they are thrown into one harrowing situation after another, all of which paradoxically lack any real sense of danger.On the plus side, viewers looking for a gloomy Pixar homage to old-school prison epics likely will not be disappointed.Another problem is Woody's and the rest of the gang's motivation for fully 85% of the movie: namely, to return to Andy's attic where they can sit in boxes and rot for years since he's going to college. This is a half-hearted desire, at best. I'm not going to say that Walk Disney is spinning in his grave over that decision, but I think he would have demanded that the creators come up with something more compelling than that.The Barbie/Ken relationship, which I was looking forward to, was handled in a clumsy and cliched manner (Ken is metrosexual and into clothes, yuk yuk) and the entire escape from the daycare center, which should be the high point of the movie, comes off as uninventive and boring. All in all, the characters have very little to do since they spend most of the movie locked up, being abused by toddlers, or preparing to be incinerated. There were also too many cheeky references made to the previous movies which quickly become tiresome, particularly the squeeze toy aliens' incessant fascination with the claw. It's almost as if the filmmakers are manipulating our love and knowledge of the previous flicks to get us to cut the new one some slack. Well, I'm not buying.But hands down, most annoying to me was the handling of Buzz Lightyear. Placing a switch that causes him to reset and essentially become the antagonist for fully half of the film was a creaky creative decision; it reminds me of the old Star Trek episode in which Picard was turned into a thoughtless Borg that threatens the Enterprise crew. Contrived machinations like that are tiresome enough in comic books and old saturday morning cartoons, never mind a big-budget Pixar effort. Then the filmmakers dive full-blown into pure camp by activating a Spanish mode in Buzz which inexplicably transforms him into some sort of obnoxious stereotypical Don Juan that sounds a whole lot like Antonio Banderas. This is a lazy, pointless plot device at least; and perhaps a whole lot worse than that if you choose to read into it.And I haven't even mentioned that the ""inspiring life-affirming message"" of the movie -- namely, ""get rid of your toys and grow up!"" -- is a tad bit cynical and will fly over the heads of a large segment of the presumed target audience (anybody under the age of 12). The ending did have some touching moments, but it feels suspiciously like lipstick on a pig.Anybody notice a trend emerging? I do, and here it is: Pixar is alternating complete masterpieces with movies that are a mixed bag! Look at their last 6 movies: Starting with Incredibles (the high-water mark for Pixar, their best to date); then Cars (the low-water mark for Pixar, their worst to date); Ratatouille (superb); WALL-E (mixed bag); Up (great); and now Toy Story 3 (mediocre, especially by Pixar standards). The good news is given this pattern, Pixar's next offering, Cars 2, should actually be GOOD. But I'm not holding my breath on that one.I drank the Pixar Kool-Aid for years, but now it is time for me to face harsh reality: John Lasseter is no longer a genius, Pixar is not infallible, and Dreamworks Animation is breathing down their neck.",1,The bloom is off the Pixar rose,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",2010,4292,"['entered', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'high', 'expectations', 'guarded', 'optimism', 'love', 'movies', 'really', 'wanted', 'one', 'be', 'good', 'promisingly', 'playful', 'derivative', 'sequence', 'bit', 'too', 'similar', 'video', 'game', 'opening', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'warning', 'right', 'there', 'something', 'was', 'off', 'film', 'continued', 'remained', 'disinterested', 'viewer', 'will', 'watched', 'wonderful', 'characters', 'subjected', 'scenarios', 'plot', 'devices', 'seemingly', 'had', 'little', 'control', 'began', 'realize', 'disappointing', 'truth', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'fool', 'gold', 'not', 'worthy', 'pedigree.The', 'previous', 'installments', 'were', 'characters', 'used', 'be', 'Pixar', 'hallmark', 'was', 'characters', 'dictated', 'action', 'propelled', 'story', 'case', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'opposite', 'true', 'plot', 'action', 'heroes', 'become', 'almost', 'interchangeable', 'arbitrary', 'are', 'thrown', 'one', 'harrowing', 'situation', 'paradoxically', 'lack', 'real', 'sense', 'danger.On', 'plus', 'side', 'viewers', 'looking', 'gloomy', 'Pixar', 'homage', 'old-school', 'prison', 'epics', 'likely', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed.Another', 'problem', 'Woody', 'rest', 'gang', 'motivation', 'fully', '85', '%', 'movie', 'namely', 'return', 'Andy', 'attic', 'where', 'can', 'sit', 'boxes', 'rot', 'years', 'going', 'college', 'half-hearted', 'desire', 'best', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'say', 'Walk', 'Disney', 'spinning', 'grave', 'decision', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'demanded', 'creators', 'come', 'up', 'something', 'more', 'compelling', 'that.The', 'Barbie/Ken', 'relationship', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'was', 'handled', 'clumsy', 'cliched', 'manner', 'Ken', 'metrosexual', 'clothes', 'yuk', 'yuk', 'entire', 'escape', 'daycare', 'center', 'should', 'be', 'high', 'point', 'movie', 'off', 'uninventive', 'boring', 'characters', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'spend', 'most', 'movie', 'locked', 'up', 'being', 'abused', 'toddlers', 'preparing', 'be', 'incinerated', 'were', 'also', 'too', 'many', 'cheeky', 'references', 'made', 'previous', 'movies', 'quickly', 'become', 'tiresome', 'particularly', 'squeeze', 'toy', 'aliens', 'incessant', 'fascination', 'claw', 'almost', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'manipulating', 'love', 'knowledge', 'previous', 'flicks', 'get', 'cut', 'new', 'one', 'slack', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'buying.But', 'hands', 'down', 'most', 'annoying', 'was', 'handling', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'Placing', 'switch', 'reset', 'essentially', 'become', 'antagonist', 'fully', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'creaky', 'creative', 'decision', 'old', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episode', 'Picard', 'was', 'turned', 'thoughtless', 'Borg', 'Enterprise', 'crew', 'Contrived', 'machinations', 'are', 'tiresome', 'enough', 'comic', 'books', 'old', 'saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'never', 'mind', 'big-budget', 'Pixar', 'effort', 'Then', 'filmmakers', 'dive', 'full-blown', 'pure', 'camp', 'activating', 'Spanish', 'mode', 'Buzz', 'inexplicably', 'sort', 'obnoxious', 'stereotypical', 'Don', 'Juan', 'whole', 'lot', 'Antonio', 'Banderas', 'lazy', 'pointless', 'plot', 'device', 'least', 'perhaps', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'choose', 'read', 'it.And', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'inspiring', 'life-affirming', 'message', 'movie', 'namely', 'get', 'rid', 'toys', 'grow', 'up', 'tad', 'bit', 'cynical', 'will', 'fly', 'heads', 'large', 'segment', 'presumed', 'target', 'audience', 'anybody', 'age', '12', 'ending', 'did', 'have', 'touching', 'moments', 'suspiciously', 'like', 'lipstick', 'pig.Anybody', 'trend', 'emerging', 'do', 'here', 'Pixar', 'alternating', 'complete', 'masterpieces', 'movies', 'are', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Look', 'last', '6', 'movies', 'Starting', 'Incredibles', 'high-water', 'mark', 'Pixar', 'best', 'date', 'then', 'Cars', 'low-water', 'mark', 'Pixar', 'worst', 'date', 'Ratatouille', 'superb', 'WALL-E', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Up', 'great', 'now', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'mediocre', 'especially', 'Pixar', 'standards', 'good', 'news', 'given', 'pattern', 'Pixar', 'next', 'offering', 'Cars', '2', 'should', 'actually', 'be', 'GOOD', ""'m"", 'not', 'holding', 'breath', 'one.I', 'drank', 'Pixar', 'Kool-Aid', 'years', 'now', 'time', 'face', 'harsh', 'reality', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'no', 'longer', 'genius', 'Pixar', 'not', 'infallible', 'Dreamworks', 'Animation', 'breathing', 'down', 'neck']",Toy Story 3

And I haven't felt that way for a long time when I've seen a new film. I may have felt sad or felt an connection to a character before but I've never actually cried (except in Titanic but that's because it was a bad movie, not because it was emotional). Most of the main cast returns except for the late Jim Varney (Slinky) and Joe Ranft (Lenny and Wheezy). While Wheezy, Bo Peep, RC and most of the other toys are gone, Blake Clark takes over as the voice of Slinky, which works just fine for me. If I hadn't known about Varney's death, I never would've caught the difference. New actors include Ned Beatty, Michael Keaton, Timothy Dalton, Whoopi Goldberg and Bonnie Hunt. The animation is brilliant, consistent with the two other films. The story is actually well put together, as I mentioned. The toys (what ones are left), having had the benefit of two films to be developed, are a close-knit family who don't want to be thrown away now that Andy is on his way to college. The toys wind up at a daycare where they are practically torn up. I won't go into too many details but the film has a ""Great Escape"" feel and near the climax is where I started to get teary eyed.

Woody, however, may be slated to go to college with his owner.Anticipating  that they will be discarded rather than given away, the little green soldiers(with R. Lee Ermey as their sergeant) depart.But soon the group, including Jessie( Joan Cusack), Mr. Potato Head(Don Rickles), Mrs. Potato Head( Estelle Harris)Slinky, (Blake Clark, replacing the late Jim Varney), the three Aliens( Jeff Pidgeon),Bullseye(Frank Welker), Hamm(John Ratzenberger), and Rex(Wallace Shawn) mistakenly end up at a daycare center, where they encounter Stretch the Octopus(Whoopi Goldberg), Molly's former Barbie doll(Jodi Benson) who was intended for the nursery school, Barbie's dim-witted clothing fanatic counterpart, Ken(Michael Keaton),Big Baby,Chuckles the Clown(Bud Luckey) and last but not least, the intially friendly but eventually sinister Lots-O-Huggin' Bear(Ned Beatty).The new arrivals are overwhelmed by the onslaught of small children, and ask to be placed in the room with the slightly older charges. But the menacing Lotso refuses and through means of intimidation plans to keep them in their place.Having left one eye behind at Andy's house. Mrs. Potato head discovers that their arrival at the nursery school was  a mistake, and eventually, after some misgivings, conspire to return home. A temporary separation from the gang results in Woody's encounter with a young charge named Bonnie, (Emily Hahn) who takes him home, and places him in her room with Trixie, the toy Triceratops(Kristen Schaal),the porcupine Mr. Pricklepants(Timothy Dalton) and the purple-haired Dolly(Bonnie Hunt).Chuckles explains how and why Lotso came to be the twisted character that he became, and despite having the toys under marshall law in the afterhours , and some potentially harrowing experiences, we know Andy's toys will always find a way back to their owner, and that anyone who stands in their way will end up where they do not want to be.In watching this, I have recalled how a girl I once babysat thought her Ken Doll was stupid, and I wonder if my now-grown former charge had a hand in making this film. But Ken's shortcomings, and support from allies such as the Chatter Telephone(Teddy Newton)--a toy I had when I was young,  combine to tip the balance in the toys' favor. We even learn along they way, that Buzz has a Spanish mode(Javier Fernandez Pena)!If Andy only knew what his toys went through to stay with him over the years!Well, all good things must come to and end, and this tale  deals with the realities of growing up, and moving on, with one last fling with friends for old time's sake.

1253310,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B00275EHJG,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[11, 16]","""Toy Story"", the film that would earn animation company Pixar Animation Studios the reputation of being the finest animation studio in the world and would literally bring Walt Disney Studios to enter new generation of animated films created entirely in CGI but also would earn the love and praise not only from the critics but the fans who wanted more and more.Released in 1995 and budgeted at $30 million, the first film would go on to make $351 million worldwide (and still making money with the recent Blu-ray release).In November 1999, the sequel ""Toy Story 2"" was released in theaters and the $90 million dollar film like its predecessor did extremely well in the domestic and worldwide box office making over $485 million.But it has been more than a decade since the release of a ""Toy Story"" film and 15 years since the first film, fans have been clamoring for a new ""Toy Story"" film and sure enough, Disney/Pixar released the third and final film of the trilogy, ""Toy Story 3"" in June 2010 and not only did it surpass the box office returns of the first two films combined, earning over 1 billion dollars, the second Disney film to earn over a billion after ""Alice in Wonderland"" (also released in 2010).""Toy Story 3"" literally shattered box office records and became the 5th highest grossing film of all time worldwide and the 9th highest grossing film in the US (and obviously the highest grossing film of 2010) and is an ultimate success for Disney/Pixar.VIDEO:When I watched ""Toy Story 1"" and ""Toy Story 2"", I easily noticed how CGI had improved between 1995 and 1999, especially with how fabric started to show more detail and we started to see more of a surface to Mr. Potato Head and T-Rex.But ""Toy Story 3"", eleven years later, you would expect CGI to take a dramatic leap forward and needless to say, ""Toy Story 3"" is visually impressive.Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio), the first thing you notice with ""Toy Story 3"" are the vibrant colors and then overall detail.  Everything shows detail and as we learn from this Blu-ray release, the animators wanted to make sure that the characters themselves do not look like toys, that they wanted to make sure the characters and toys are distinguished and the animators succeeded in every way possible.Mr. Potato Head, you literally see the surface like the actual toy, down to its seams.  Look at the hardwood floors in Andy's room, so much detail on the floor that it looks realistic, even some outdoor scenes look photorealistic (especially the animation and CG shown during Lotso's past, wow!).  And the fabric of the clothing, you can see the threading, the weaves and how much detail went into the clothing. One scene with the monkey, it looks like a stuffed monkey with its detail, the detail of it's clothing and scary eyes, these models look fantastic!  Also, see the dirt and grime on the animals, that was awesome how they captured that in the film.The hair even was well-done, the wear and tear that the toys go through at Sunnyside Daycare is evident through the nicks and scratches and also looking at Andy's trunk and seeing the little chips on the trunk to the paint and we can see the brush strokes on the walls, ""Toy Story 3"" just looks magnificent on Blu-ray and I don't see how any videophile can say anything negative about how this film looks on Blu-ray.And facial expressions of the human characters such as Andy, his sister, his mother to Bonnie, these were well-animated and rendered.I did notice some banding but times I did see it were short.  For example, when Woody is back at Sunnyside, he is holding the red phone receiver and the banding is evident in that one scene but again, the scenes you do see it are seconds long and does not distract you from how fantastic this film looks.This is the best looking Disney/Pixar film to date!  Vibrant, detailed and everything about the picture quality is going to make videophiles swoon!  It's that impressive and easily a reference quality Blu-ray release for picture quality!As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is presented in Widescreen (1:78:1).AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Toy Story 3 "" is presented in English 7.1 DTS Master Audio and English 5.1 DTS Master Audio.  Also, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital EX is included as well as English 2.0 DVS.All I can say is that ""Toy Story 3' sounds magnificent.  The first action scenes that startoff the film will show you how awesome this film sounds in lossless.  From Mrs. Potato Head's voice coming from the surround channels, sounds coming from the rear surround channels, LFE being utilized for the evil Dr. Porkchop's laser beam or when Mr. Potato Head has Slinky Dog turn on its force field and Jesse calling on T-Rex, this is just impressive to hear the sound coming from all channels.Dialogue is crystal clear and music is just as clear!  And you then hear how the sound is utilized during the children's rush to get the toys as they slam them all over the place, the garbage dump as everything is being compacted and you can hear flames pattering, the garbage truck coming from the distance, tiny footstep sounds throughout the room... really, there are so many sounds that are well-utilized throughout this film, it's very impressive!  Sure, the film is not 100% action-based but action and non-action scenes, the film sounds fantastic on Blu-ray and I didn't even notice a lot of these sounds at the theater when I watched this film this past summer.So, you really experience a  great, immersive soundscape with ""Toy Story 3' from all channels, especially via LFE. Not only is picture quality hitting the high marks for reference quality, the lossless audio is just as magnificent and audiophiles should be happy with this Blu-ray release as well!Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

The digital copy of the feature film works with iTunes and Windows Media Player.  Also, a slip over cover comes with this Blu-ray release.JUDGMENT CALL:I'm sure that ""Toy Story 3"" hit people a lot harder emotionally than some viewers.  Some look at it as the next level of wonderful CGI graphics for Disney/Pixar animated films, others look at the film as another successful film for the studio but I'm going to go even farther and say that this film caught my attention, not because I grew up with the previous two films but the fact is that like the character of Andy, during my late teens, it was time to say goodbye to all the toys that I once owned.Memories of having friends overnight to play with these toys, memories of opening the old department store catalogs and hoping my grandparents would get me the latest toy that I picked out and then to open it in Christmas morning.  Suffice to say, when it came to my toys... I was very fortunate to have such a memorable time playing with them and having caring family to help support that habit.  But unlike Andy, I did not have the moment to say goodbye, it was more like, turn 16 and my parents made the conscious decision to throw out all my toys and force me to sell all my comic books and prepare for graduation and SAT tests and so forth.Needless to say, it was not necessarily a traumatic moment but it was a defining moment...OK, who am I kidding, it was one of the saddest moments in my life.So, ""Toy Story 3"" for me, was just a magnificent film that took me back to those old days of playing in my room and like Andy, having these wild adventures that I could conjure in my head and sooner or later, we grow older, become interested in different things and sooner or later, we say goodbye and prepare for our next stage in our lives as young adults.I watched this film knowing that it was going to be successful and along with my wife, my son and my nephew, watched it in 3D the first day it came to theater.  But watching it on Blu-ray, without the usual audience distractions, my experience this time around was heightened.  Watching ""Toy Story 3"" in 1080p, I was amazed by how vibrant the film looked, how much detail was showcased.  From the little tears in Andy's toy chest, the clothing of the characters, the dirt and grime on the toys, the wonderful lossless audio and then for me to watch the special features in three days because there are a good number of them included, I can't help but feel that this is truly a perfect release.Yes, I am sure the videophiles will say there was banding on the picture quality but those banding moments were few and were short.  Really, everything you love about the film, you get that and more in the ""Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack"". It's important for people to know that if you don't need the accompanying DVD or the digital copy, you can also purchase the Blu-ray two-disc version as well.Personally, I can't find one significant flaw with this Blu-ray release.  There is something for everyone in this release, may you be a fan of the film, a person wanting to learn about the animation business and learn from the awesome team at Pixar, there is just so much to love about this release that it's definitely one of the top 10 Blu-ray releases of 2010 and that is pretty tough as this year alone had many significant releases, especially coming from Disney.  If anything, Walt Disney continues to raise the bar for its Blu-ray releases and I suppose since this is finale farewell for the ""Toy Story"" series (which I would imagine is not set in stone because ""Toy Story"" made an insane amount of money for Disney and ""Toy Story 3"" made over a billion dollars worldwide, I just can't see this being a 100% final farewell), they had to go out with a bang for this Blu-ray release.Overall, ""Toy Story 3"" is a film in which Pixar continues to their reign of innovation, their mark on quality of beautifully animated films and a well-written storyline that just pulls you in.  The Blu-ray release is not just for those who love ""Toy Story 3"" but for those who loved the ""Toy Story"" trilogy.  If you loved the first two films, then this is a no-brainer, this is a must-buy release.""Toy Story 3: 4-Disc Combo Pack"" is magnificent and is a true 5-star release!

1253311,A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,B00275EHJG,Derek,"[0, 0]","I think that this movie went a long way in proving the ability of Pixar to make outstanding films and never cease to amaze their audience. This film had a lot of people worried and had a pretty big wall of expectation to overcome. I know that I personally was groaning at the idea of ANOTHER Toy Story film. I liked thefirst filmand thesecond filmdid a good job of topping the first one. But I felt like I had been to the world of toys enough after the second one and was not impressed with the idea of a third part in the franchise. The first few previews for the film did not help convince me either. It was not until it came out and started getting excellent reviews that I began to think differently. I have always liked Pixar, but as Pixar is teamed with Disney now, Disney has a horrible track record with sequels. I think the success of this film really rested upon the direction they took with it story-wise.In this third installment, Andy is packing up for college and most of the toys assume that Andy doesn't want them anymore and donate themselves to Sunnyside Day Care. Upon arriving at Sunnyside, they realize that everything is not as sunny and bright as they first thought.I think this film answered a lot of questions brought up by the first two films and really takes a deeper look into the emotions of the toys when they feel that the one they loved so much no longer loved them. This idea leads to some very strong character development for not only the toys, but Andy as well. While the film remains humorous and fun throughout, it definitely has a more serious and emotional side to it than did the previous films.Pixar has always risen above the odds and I hope to see this tradition continue, especially since the next film they're releasing isCars 2. That will have a lot of hurdles to overcome. I felt that this was a very well-done film and really took us to new heights and new lows with the toys we have grown to love since 1995. The film was handled very carefully by Pixar and they made sure to make it a new and exciting experience for us without making it a different world all together. I also think that Pixar ended this film and this franchise perfectly with all the pieces placed exactly where they should be.A big shout-out for Pixar in this film and their ability to surprise and delight us over and over and over again.[...]",4,Humorous and fun throughout,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",2012,2364,"['think', 'movie', 'went', 'long', 'way', 'proving', 'ability', 'Pixar', 'make', 'outstanding', 'films', 'never', 'cease', 'amaze', 'audience', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'people', 'worried', 'had', 'pretty', 'big', 'wall', 'expectation', 'overcome', 'know', 'personally', 'was', 'groaning', 'idea', 'ANOTHER', 'Toy', 'Story', 'film', 'liked', 'thefirst', 'filmand', 'thesecond', 'filmdid', 'good', 'job', 'topping', 'first', 'one', 'felt', 'had', 'been', 'world', 'toys', 'enough', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'not', 'impressed', 'idea', 'third', 'part', 'franchise', 'first', 'few', 'previews', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'convince', 'was', 'not', 'came', 'out', 'started', 'getting', 'excellent', 'reviews', 'began', 'think', 'differently', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'Pixar', 'Pixar', 'teamed', 'Disney', 'now', 'Disney', 'horrible', 'track', 'record', 'sequels', 'think', 'success', 'film', 'really', 'rested', 'direction', 'took', 'story-wise.In', 'third', 'installment', 'Andy', 'packing', 'up', 'college', 'most', 'toys', 'assume', 'Andy', ""n't"", 'want', 'anymore', 'donate', 'Sunnyside', 'Day', 'Care', 'arriving', 'Sunnyside', 'realize', 'everything', 'not', 'sunny', 'bright', 'first', 'thought.I', 'think', 'film', 'answered', 'lot', 'questions', 'brought', 'up', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'really', 'deeper', 'look', 'emotions', 'toys', 'when', 'feel', 'one', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'no', 'longer', 'loved', 'idea', 'very', 'strong', 'character', 'development', 'not', 'only', 'toys', 'Andy', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'humorous', 'fun', 'definitely', 'more', 'serious', 'emotional', 'side', 'did', 'previous', 'films.Pixar', 'always', 'risen', 'odds', 'hope', 'see', 'tradition', 'continue', 'especially', 'next', 'film', ""'re"", 'releasing', 'isCars', '2', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'hurdles', 'overcome', 'felt', 'was', 'very', 'well-done', 'film', 'really', 'took', 'new', 'heights', 'new', 'lows', 'toys', 'have', 'grown', 'love', '1995', 'film', 'was', 'handled', 'very', 'carefully', 'Pixar', 'made', 'sure', 'make', 'new', 'exciting', 'experience', 'making', 'different', 'world', 'together', 'also', 'think', 'Pixar', 'ended', 'film', 'franchise', 'perfectly', 'pieces', 'placed', 'exactly', 'where', 'should', 'be.A', 'big', 'shout-out', 'Pixar', 'film', 'ability', 'surprise', 'delight', 'again.', '[', ']']",Toy Story 3

Don't get me wrong, I always considered it one of the best but I want it to see how they will manage a second sequel of a beloved franchise? Well, they manage it brilliantly and TS3 has become a crowning achievement in Pixar's great catalogue. So far has been 11/11. Perfect in every way.TS3 reunites us with our favorites toys and they haven't age one day. But in reality Andy has and now they face a grim prospect of being neglected or worse, destroyed. I won't give any plot detalis but let me tell you that this movie make me cry. And I never cry in a picture. Never!! Not even in Up in that wonderful beginning, but TS3 did it. The ending is bittersweet and beautiful at the same time. Needless to say the animation is superb, the cast is awesome and the story is excellent. I feel sorry for How to Train Your Dragon because it is a terrific film but can't compare to TS3. It's 2010 best film . Thank you Pixar and thank you Woody, Buzz and the others for once again making us live a wonderful experience. Congratulations.Video & Audio:Now released on Blu-Ray, TS3 is nothing short of fantastic in this set. Picture is completely demo-quality with vibrant colors, sharo detail and lush animation. An amazing transfer.Likewise, the 7.1 DTS-HD MA will rock your house. It envelops you and completely blows you away with the level of clarity that it has.Bonus Features:This is a 2-Disc BD set that is choked full of bonus material. First you got the delightful theatrical short ""Day & Night"", you got a PIP commenatry with the director and the producer, a trivia game, a Paths to Pixar featurette that this time feature Editors, a cast reunion, a how to write a screenplay with Michael Arndt, Studio stories, Trailers and much much more. All the features are excellent and will leave you completely satisfied.This set also contains a DVD and a Digital Copy.Closing Thoughts:TS3 is a crowning achievement for Pixar. Where more franchises will fail, Pixar has succeeded triumphantly and this third entry in the TS series is an instant classic. This set is a must own.

""Toy Story 2"" was about loving others, even if it means you might get hurt someday.So what is ""Toy Story 3"" about? It takes the whole ""kids + loyal toys"" theme to its natural conclusion, by showing us what happens when the kids grow up and leave. While the first two-thirds of the movie are fairly pedestrian (for a Pixar movie!), the last part is both action-packed and emotionally wrenching.Ten years have passed, and Andy is now a college-bound teenager. His toys are anxious about what's going to happen, so Woody keeps assuring them that they'll be put safely in the attic. But a misunderstanding leads to a date with the garbage truck. Since the toys believe they have been abandoned, they jump into the box of donated toys bound for Sunnyside Daycare.They're greeted by the genial Lots-o'-Hugging Bear (aka Lotso) and the friendly daycare toys, and all seems to be well. But Andy's toys soon discover that Sunnyside is a nighmare -- they've been assigned the ""Caterpillar Room"" for wild abusive toddlers, and Lotso is the Godfatheresque overlord of the daycare. Once Woody learns the true horrors of Sunnyside, he must infiltrate the daycare and somehow get his friends out.You know that the movie industry is officially in a slump when the cleverest, funniest and most touching movie of the summer... is a CGI sequel about toys. ""Toy Story 3"" starts off rather lightweight at first, with the toys being brought into Sunnyside and Woody setting off in another direction.But once Lotso is revealed as the villain, the movie takes a sharp turn -- it becomes a clever, complex ""Great Escape""-style caper, with some moments of G-rated horror (THE MONKEY!) and hilarity (resetting Buzz ends up turning him into a flamenco-dancing suave Spaniard). And while the toys' attempted escape from Sunnyside is taut and genuinely thrilling, it's only the START of the climax -- a harrowing, genuinely scary chase scene that brings the toys together.And there's a bittersweet core to ""Toy Story 3"": kids grow up, leave home and the people/toys they leave behind are both proud and sad. In the final scenes of the movie,we're quietly ushered through the emotional goodbyes and hellos of growing up.And the adorable little cast of toys still remind us that what matters most is love and loyalty, particularly during a deadly crisis where they all fearfully join hands (it sounds sappy, but it isn't). There's also some endearing additions to the cast -- the foppish clotheshorse Ken, Big Baby, a Totoro, a giggly tricerotops, and the Shakespearean stuffed hedgehog Mr. Pricklepants.Anyway, this blu-ray/DVD combo has a wealth of extras -- trailers teasers, theatrical shorts (oh look, Night and Day are scuffling!), ""Cine-emplore,"" commentary, lots of making-ofs, behind the scenes stuff like ""A Toy's Eye View: Creating A Whole New Land,"" a music video, and just lots of endearing odds and ends like Ken's dating tips. Er...It hurts to say goodbye to Woody, Buzz and their friends, but ""Toy Story 3"" is a fitting farewell that brings the trilogy full circle.

The toys have been donated to a nursery. The toys just want to get back to Andy but Lots-o-Huggin the bear tries to explain to them that they were given up and should stay. He also tries to convince the toys that they will never be without a kid to play with. Once one group of kids leaves, another group comes in. But..we all know, the toys just want to go home.An interesting twist where the toys find Buzz's ""Spanish mode"" is very entertaining. You don't have to understand Spanish to enjoy this part of the movie. In the behind the scenes, the actor who takes over for the Spanish parts explains his inspiration for his performance and it is well done.The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the story has been told a thousand times. The obsticles they face, perils and enemies that rise up are the same old obsticles we've seen before. There is no big twist ending but it still is a typical Pixar ending.

More than once i tried to surprise them yet I was never successful. How silly this sounds now. Two years later I moved out of Peru and started a new life in the USA. I was instantly thrown into the school system. Not having many friends and not being accustomed I always resorted to movies and toys. I declared to myself I would never outgrow toys. I don't understand how anybody can? Yet little by little you do. You start college, work, new interests come and before you know it all your toys are either already gone or stored away. What happened? There was a time when a simple playtime with my G.I. Joe would be enough to keep me happy the whole day. But life continues and as certain stages end new ones start. What Toy Story 3 does is brings us back to that time of innocence, makes us remember exactly how it felt to be a kid again, gives a feeling of accomplishment and looks at the future with hope. Achievement no other movie has tackle so deeply before.

Thes is my favorite animated movie series, with Shrek coming in a close second (mainly because Shrek 3 was terrible).  Each Toy Story movie has expanded the universe of toys and the issues that they have to deal with, issues that reflect our own lives.Toy Story 3 takes place at a turning point in the lives of Andy's remaining toys as he is pretty much grown up and off to college.  Will they end up going with him, be sent off to the attic, or thrown out?  In the end, his toys accidentally end up at a daycare run by another group of toys who are led by a sweet fuzzy bear named Lotso who smells of strawberries.  But things are not what they seem and Woody and Buzz and the rest of their friends need to figure out a way of the mess they've ended up in, pulling together once more to help each other.We meet even more toys in this movie, some familiar and some new.  Favorite scenes include the Dreamhouse one as Ken tries to impress Barbie with his clothes.  Mr Potatohead's troubles with a pigeon.  Plus, the final scene (which I won't give away) but is sweet and sad together and just perfect for the ending of the movie.One of the new characters, the cymbal-clanging monkey, is a bit freaky and might be uncomfortable for smaller kids.  Big Baby also has his freaky moments.  The dangers that the good guys get into can be a big too real for some younger watchers...but so were some scenes from the previous movies, including Toy Story 1 with the creepy toys in the bad kids room made out of parts of other toys and threatening to blow up Buzz.The animation just keeps on getting better in these movies and Toy Story 3 comes in second only to Toy Story 1 for innovation and creativity.

Now Toy Story 3 has surged ahead of its sister films and become the leader. It has also done what even Coppola couldn't do: make a third sequel that arguably tops the first two films.Much has already been said and written about Toy Story 3. While the majority of opinions have been positive, it has also been called the ""darkest"" of the Toy Story movies. Some have also expressed displeasure at the cruelty of the Lotso character. [Spoiler alert] One might wonder if there were some behind the scenes debates; there had to been some concern that the fluffy pink bear's misbehavior might have affected merchandising and such (though to our family's thinking, we've reconciled the plush and theme park versions of Lotso as ""other Lotsos"" and not the discarded, bitter bear we saw in the movie.Toy Story 3, like all of Pixar's features and shorts, seem to have a creative vision funneled through a singular director. Even though TS3's director, Lee Unkrich, has been with the franchise since the beginning, this particular film really has Unkrich's humor and intensity.This theory is based on the extensive and detailed audio commentary he does with producer Darla K (for Kay) Anderson, in which explains the stories behind the story decisions and even the little jokes (for instance, Michael Keaton mispronounced ""library"" as Ken and Unkrich left it in and overruled requests to the contrary -- and it does get a laugh in theaters). But on a larger scale, if one were to take the caricature of him literally (which you can see in a bonus feature about the crew shaving their heads), he seems to be perceived as a pretty intense fellow.I saw the movie three times in theaters and my family saw it twice. It made me misty eyed every time, both at the beginning and especially at the end. Like Walt Disney's classic animation, these CG-generated creatures have the ability to elicit real emotion from viewers. When Andy explains each toy to little Bonnie, it's truly touching, not contrived for effect. And yet the film is laugh out loud funny in other places, such as Mr. Potato Head's makeshift ""base bodies."" Much of these ideas are explained in the commentary too.Nearly every animated feature today uses celebrity voices, but to the new and carryover casts of Toy Story 3, this isn't just a pick-up-the-check-and-mention-it-to-Leno deal to any of the stars involved here. They know they are part of something special and don't take it lightly, I'm certain. My favorite performances have to be Jodi Benson as Barbie and the aforementioned Keaton as Ken. The apparently did their lines together and the timing pays off (many voice actors, especially stars, do their lines separately). It's even funny when Ken is reading the roll and, angry at his lady doll, call her name out with middle-school disdain (""BAR-bie."") Things like this make repeated viewings fun.Most of the extras are on the 2 Blu-ray discs, though the commentary and a few of the ""animatic""-style behind the scenes features are also on the single DVD. I was particularly pleased that there is also a narrative audio option for the entire film, so those with sight challenges can enjoy the film as a narrator explains the action. This is actually quite nice as a bonus feature too, because you don't have to stare at the screen and you can get a ""Disneyland Storyteller"" LP-type experience. Perhaps this service, produced by WGBH in Boston, will be included on future Disney and Pixar releases.",5,"""Three's"" the charm, the tearjerker and perhaps the best!",1289088000,"11 7, 2010",2010,3553,"['Pixar', 'already', 'Hollywood', 'dumbfounded', 'unbroken', 'track', 'record', 'solid', 'box', 'office', 'hits', 'Now', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'surged', 'ahead', 'sister', 'films', 'become', 'leader', 'also', 'done', 'what', 'even', 'Coppola', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'make', 'third', 'sequel', 'arguably', 'first', 'two', 'films.Much', 'already', 'been', 'said', 'written', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'majority', 'opinions', 'have', 'been', 'positive', 'also', 'been', 'called', 'darkest', 'Toy', 'Story', 'movies', 'have', 'also', 'expressed', 'displeasure', 'cruelty', 'Lotso', 'character', '[', 'Spoiler', 'alert', ']', 'One', 'might', 'wonder', 'were', 'scenes', 'debates', 'had', 'been', 'concern', 'fluffy', 'pink', 'bear', 'misbehavior', 'might', 'have', 'affected', 'merchandising', 'such', 'family', 'thinking', ""'ve"", 'reconciled', 'plush', 'theme', 'park', 'versions', 'Lotso', 'other', 'Lotsos', 'not', 'discarded', 'bitter', 'saw', 'movie.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Pixar', 'features', 'shorts', 'seem', 'have', 'creative', 'vision', 'funneled', 'singular', 'director', 'Even', 'TS3', 'director', 'Lee', 'Unkrich', 'been', 'franchise', 'beginning', 'particular', 'film', 'really', 'Unkrich', 'humor', 'intensity.This', 'theory', 'based', 'extensive', 'detailed', 'audio', 'commentary', 'producer', 'Darla', 'K', 'Kay', 'Anderson', 'stories', 'story', 'decisions', 'even', 'little', 'jokes', 'instance', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'mispronounced', 'library', 'Ken', 'Unkrich', 'left', 'overruled', 'requests', 'contrary', 'get', 'laugh', 'theaters', 'larger', 'scale', 'one', 'were', 'take', 'caricature', 'literally', 'can', 'see', 'bonus', 'feature', 'crew', 'shaving', 'heads', 'be', 'perceived', 'pretty', 'intense', 'fellow.I', 'saw', 'movie', 'three', 'times', 'theaters', 'family', 'saw', 'twice', 'made', 'misty', 'eyed', 'time', 'beginning', 'especially', 'end', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'classic', 'animation', 'CG-generated', 'creatures', 'have', 'ability', 'elicit', 'real', 'emotion', 'viewers', 'When', 'Andy', 'toy', 'little', 'Bonnie', 'truly', 'touching', 'not', 'contrived', 'effect', 'yet', 'film', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'other', 'places', 'such', 'Mr', 'Potato', 'Head', 'makeshift', 'base', 'bodies', 'Much', 'ideas', 'are', 'explained', 'commentary', 'too.Nearly', 'animated', 'feature', 'today', 'celebrity', 'voices', 'new', 'carryover', 'casts', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', ""n't"", 'just', 'pick-up-the-check-and-mention-it-to-Leno', 'deal', 'stars', 'involved', 'here', 'know', 'are', 'part', 'something', 'special', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'lightly', ""'m"", 'certain', 'favorite', 'performances', 'have', 'be', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'Barbie', 'aforementioned', 'Keaton', 'Ken', 'apparently', 'did', 'lines', 'together', 'timing', 'many', 'voice', 'actors', 'especially', 'stars', 'do', 'lines', 'separately', 'even', 'funny', 'when', 'Ken', 'reading', 'roll', 'angry', 'lady', 'doll', 'call', 'name', 'middle-school', 'disdain', 'BAR-bie', 'make', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'fun.Most', 'extras', 'are', '2', 'Blu-ray', 'discs', 'commentary', 'few', 'animatic', '-style', 'scenes', 'features', 'are', 'also', 'single', 'DVD', 'was', 'particularly', 'pleased', 'also', 'narrative', 'audio', 'option', 'entire', 'film', 'sight', 'challenges', 'can', 'enjoy', 'film', 'narrator', 'action', 'actually', 'quite', 'nice', 'bonus', 'feature', 'too', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'stare', 'screen', 'can', 'get', 'Disneyland', 'Storyteller', 'LP-type', 'experience', 'Perhaps', 'service', 'produced', 'WGBH', 'Boston', 'will', 'be', 'included', 'future', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'releases']",Toy Story 3

1253349,A2GPN2VKS8E77C,B00275EHJG,HAMLET,"[0, 0]","I saw this movie for the first time a few hours ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Disney & Pixar have crafted another wonderful movie with positive messages, and this one is a fitting conclusion to the Toy Story saga.Biblically speaking, there is nothing offensive. There are a few scenes that may be intense for those under eight years of age, but nothing over the top (""The Wizard Of Oz"" and other G-rated films contain scary scenes, but nothing worthy of a higher rating). It earned the G rating, and deserves the Oscars for Best Animated Film and Best Picture that it's been nominated for (the Academy Awards will be in February). I caught myself about to cry during one scene (for fear of revealing a major plot point, I can't and won't say which scene it was). Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and the rest of the cast (minus Jim Varney) return, along with all-new voice casting, which includes the original Batman (Michael Keaton) and my favourite James Bond (Timothy Dalton). I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. Have some tissues handy, because you'll need them. (I do wish Mr. Pricklepants' role had been bigger, though). Keep watching through the credits.Though the end of the film subtly implies that this is the final installment in the Toy Story franchise, I sincerely hope it isn't. For all three motion pictures, the writing, voice casting, animation and all the other production values have been top-notch, as you would expect from Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar.Now that I think of it, there are parallels between this film and the Christian life.

1253352,A1B83POK9C91OP,B00275EHJG,HollyC.Ong,"[2, 4]","Getting too old to play with toys is something that everyone has to go through. Toy Story 3 is an excellent example of a movie that views this situation in a way that makes the viewer sympathize with both the toys and their now older kid owner who is off to college. In the opening scene, Buzz and Woody, two toys, wake up in an old toy box many years later than when viewers had last seen them. After giving a wide scan of the room, the cruel truth of the fate of being a toy kicks in. We soon find out that over the years the other toys had been given away, and the characters' feelings about it are learned. I found that this movie is both relatable and has many great themes that are addressed today in society.Later within the same scene, their owner Andy finishes up packing for college and has to make the hard decision of whom he is going to take with him. Of course all of the toys want to go, but they also want to stay together and not have to get split up. Andy ends up choosing Woody, since he is more sentimentally attached to him than the other toys.  Although Woody is happy that he was the chosen toy, he still does not want to split up from his friends. Later, Andy puts all of the other toys in a trash bag to store in the attic, but his mom mistakens it for things that he wants to throw away. After a heroic scene of escaping from the horrific trash truck's clutches, the toys feel that they are not wanted anymore. They make the brave decision of donating themselves to a Sunnyside Daycare, but Woody finds them and tries to get them to stay. He accidentally ends up going with them to the daycare. When they arrive, they are welcomed by many toys and Lots-O-Huggin' Bear, who is in charge of them all. The Andy's toys all get assigned to the Caterpillar Room, and Woody finally gives up trying to convince them and goes home.Not long after Woody leaves, the toys get a taste for what they are in for. They learn the hard way that the kids in the Caterpillar Room are way too young to be playing with toys and greatly mistreat them. That night, Buzz escapes the room to plead with the other toys to change their room. Lots-O-Huggin' Bear claims that all new toys go there first, and he soon gets mad. He figures out that Lots-O and some of the other toys at the daycare are bad. They switch Buzz's setting, so he starts talking in Spanish. Meanwhile, when Woody had been walking home, a girl form the daycare had picked him up and taken him home with her. He meets other toys at her house. One of which had had the same owner as Lots-O-Huggin' Bear and reveals the story of why he is now so evil.Lots-O begins to let Andy's toys view his real side, and he locks all of them up. He has them all under heavy surveillance. By morning, Woody has returned to help out his friends. He had realized that they were in danger when the toys from the girl's house had told him about Lots-O. From here on, the toys have to work together to achieve their goal of escaping the daycare and getting back home, where they belong.What I loved about this movie was how relatable it is to both children and adults. Almost every person, at some point in their life, thought that toys were real and came to life when we were not there.  Toy Story 3 captures this perfect in not just this last installment, but both of the previous movies also, in a way that most would have envisioned it. Another aspect if the movie that I at first found interesting that they would put in a children's movie, was that everyone gets too old for toys. When I had heard that that was going to be in the movie, I had thought that this topic would somewhat upset kids because they love their toys so much now. However while watching the movie, I realized that I had been wrong by assuming that. It was used very well in the plot, to the point that it was appreciated by the adults and children watching. At some points it had me in tears, but I mostly believe that this was because I knew that I had already gone through what was addressed in the movie. This leads me to my next point, which is about having to give toys away, another sensitive topic for children. Again, this was used at a perfect angle to show that it is something that has to be done, but it will turn out okay.Another great feature of this movie is that it has many great themes that are addressed today in society. This film addressed bullying, which is the same whether it is with people or toys. Exclusion is another topic that is dealt with. No one likes to feel left out and not as special as others. In the movie, Lots-O and the other older toys at the daycare got more privileges and could do what ever they wanted. They pretty much ran the place. I do not think that it is much different that what teenagers and kids do to each other in real life. This movie really proves to its viewers that they can get through similar situations.All in all, this was a good movie, that was not like the tasteless animated sequels sometimes seen in kids movies. I actually liked this movie better than the ones that came before it. Toy Story 3 was not only made for the obvious child audience but also for the parent audience as well. Who enjoyed it more?

Not only was it the first fully CGI film in the United States (some debate over whether it was the first in the world), but it had a great story to boot. Such a combination, and executed so incredibly well, was and still is rather unusual. It also popularized the idea of casting well-known actors in voice acting roles. So where does this leave us? ""Toy Story 3"", as many know, sees Andy grown up into a teen going off to college. After a mixup having to do with trash bags and donation boxes, the toys - the last of Andy's beloved toys - find themselves in the Sunnyside Daycare center. Things appear fine and dandy at first, but it turns out that not all is as it seems.The film starts out with a fantastically over-the-top sequence reminiscent of Andy's playtime as a little boy, which transitions smoothly into the ""meat"" of the film. Within the first ten minutes, Pixar somehow manages to hit several different emotional notes ranging from euphoric to sad. Those of us growing up with the series can relate to crossing the line between childhood and adulthood, so really this is a swan song on more levels than just for these beloved characters, and it tugs at one's heartstrings more than almost any modern film - if not any film, period. The rest of the movie is filled with emotional peaks and valleys that never feel out-of-place or unbalanced (Pixar has learned very, very well from ""Wall-E"" and ""Up""). The animation quality is utterly fantastic and avoids the ""uncanny valley"" normally associated with computer-generated human characters. What really makes the film, though, is the belief that these are not characters in a movie, or pixels on a computer. These characters are REAL, and they feel real right up to the end.Though I admit the montage shown in the end-credits reel sort of undermined the power of the ending (one really, really gets the feeling that this is the end and there will be no more Toy Story films), it's not enough to be bothersome. The ending is emotionally, wholly satisfying, the perfect tribute to the trilogy as a whole and Pixar itself. As far as I'm concerned, this isn't Disney. This is Pixar all the way. The ending left not a dry eye in the audience, even if it was but a prickle behind the eye. It is impossible to walk out of here without feeling as though one is really saying goodbye, physically, to these wonderful characters.Some have said that the 3D presentation detracts from the film. The glasses make the backgrounds a bit dark at times, yes, but it's not enough to worry about at all. This film isn't about petty ""3D gags"" where things jump out at the audience. The effect is more like it was for ""Avatar"": depth of field and a sense of space. The rooms feel spacious, as if they were really there. Distances are more easily comprehensible (the landfill near the end not only LOOKS enormous, but FEELS like it, too). There is some flickering when objects move fast on the screen, but again, not enough to detract. The short film ""Night & Day"" before the main feature benefits beautifully from the 3D, as well.Bottom line: the film is fantastic and well worth seeing during its theatrical run. See it in 3D if you can.

1253354,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,B00275EHJG,Ian,"[4, 5]","In the film world, a trilogy can be a good thing, a chance to tell a long story over three parts, enabling us to become emotionally attached to the characters and the world they live in. Unfortunately however, many times the third film in the series can be tired and worn out, the result of the creativity and spark dying out long before the cameras roll.Thankfully however, that's not the case with Toy Story 3, which is the perfect ending to the series, and a moving and emotional one at that.Picking up several years after the end of its predecessor, Toy Story 3 finds Andy, now 18, packing up and heading off to college. Woody, Buzz, and all his old toys now spend their time in a toy box, essentially forgotten. When told that he either has to store them in the attic, throw them out, or donate them to a daycare center, Andy sets events in motion that will lead to what is essentially judgment day for Woody and the gang...the fact that Andy has outgrown them, and that they are essentially, in Andy's words, junk, facing an uncertain future.Of all of Pixar's movies, it's my opinion that Toy Story 3 is by far the most emotional. While a simple story about the toys we all know so well, it tackles the issue of mortality. Unlike what Randy Newman's famous, ""You've Got A Friend in Me"" song says, friendships do die. Relationships drift apart, and life changes, and not always for the better. And it's here that Toy Story 3 shines. It may not have the most action of the series (Film 2 holds that honor), but it does have the most heart, as it follows the toys we all know and love as they struggle to find their place in a frightening world where they could be thrown out, discarded, and destroyed at any time. This is a film about loss, the ending of relationships, and the fact that nothing lasts forever.  Nowhere is this more apparent then the film's final act, which is the most dramatic of the entire series (and without question, Pixar's greatest drama scenes), and concludes with an ending that had me in tears, and at some points, sobbing.It's always hard to see great things coming to an end. I've grown up with these characters, having seen the first film in grade school, and now seeing the gang's final adventure shortly after graduating from college. But, as cheesy at it sounds, it's a relationship I'll always treasure, and will be grateful for enjoying. As Buzz says early in the film, it's best to go out on a high note, and Toy Story 3 accomplishes it with ease. In my opinion, it's Pixar's most emotional film, and their most bittersweet...but even through the tears, you'll walk out with a smile.",5,"A fond, bittersweet farewell",1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,2624,"['film', 'world', 'trilogy', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'chance', 'tell', 'long', 'story', 'three', 'parts', 'enabling', 'become', 'emotionally', 'attached', 'characters', 'world', 'live', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'many', 'times', 'third', 'film', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'tired', 'worn', 'out', 'result', 'creativity', 'spark', 'dying', 'out', 'long', 'cameras', 'roll.Thankfully', 'however', 'not', 'case', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'perfect', 'ending', 'series', 'moving', 'emotional', 'one', 'that.Picking', 'up', 'several', 'years', 'end', 'predecessor', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Andy', 'now', '18', 'packing', 'up', 'heading', 'off', 'college', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'old', 'toys', 'now', 'spend', 'time', 'toy', 'box', 'essentially', 'forgotten', 'When', 'told', 'store', 'attic', 'throw', 'out', 'donate', 'daycare', 'center', 'Andy', 'events', 'motion', 'will', 'lead', 'what', 'essentially', 'judgment', 'day', 'Woody', 'gang', 'fact', 'Andy', 'outgrown', 'are', 'essentially', 'Andy', 'words', 'junk', 'facing', 'uncertain', 'future.Of', 'Pixar', 'movies', 'opinion', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'far', 'most', 'emotional', 'simple', 'story', 'toys', 'know', 'so', 'well', 'issue', 'mortality', 'what', 'Randy', 'Newman', 'famous', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Friend', 'Me', 'song', 'friendships', 'do', 'die', 'Relationships', 'drift', 'apart', 'life', 'changes', 'not', 'always', 'better', 'here', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'shines', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'most', 'action', 'series', 'Film', '2', 'honor', 'have', 'most', 'heart', 'toys', 'know', 'love', 'struggle', 'find', 'place', 'frightening', 'world', 'where', 'could', 'be', 'thrown', 'out', 'discarded', 'destroyed', 'time', 'film', 'loss', 'ending', 'relationships', 'fact', 'nothing', 'forever', 'Nowhere', 'more', 'apparent', 'then', 'film', 'final', 'act', 'most', 'dramatic', 'entire', 'series', 'question', 'Pixar', 'greatest', 'drama', 'scenes', 'ending', 'had', 'tears', 'points', 'sobbing.It', 'always', 'hard', 'see', 'great', 'things', 'coming', 'end', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'up', 'characters', 'having', 'seen', 'first', 'film', 'grade', 'school', 'now', 'seeing', 'gang', 'final', 'adventure', 'shortly', 'graduating', 'college', 'cheesy', 'relationship', ""'ll"", 'always', 'treasure', 'will', 'be', 'grateful', 'enjoying', 'Buzz', 'early', 'film', 'best', 'go', 'out', 'high', 'note', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'accomplishes', 'ease', 'opinion', 'Pixar', 'most', 'emotional', 'film', 'most', 'bittersweet', 'even', 'tears', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'out', 'smile']",Toy Story 3

Toy Story has been with us for 15 years now (20, in terms of actual development) and I had a sinking feeling that maybe all the character potential had been used in the first two and this was some shameless plot by Disney to exploit the franchise (""Little Mermaid 3"", anyone?). Well, shame on me for underestimating the capabilities of Pixar, who once again have shown how a small studio in Emeryville is a storytelling powerhouse that leaves the rest of the industry in the dust.Toy Story 3 is the tale of Andy, the toys' owner, going to college and their quest to determine their future - headed between the attic or a daycare center. If you've enjoyed the way the first two films blend character drama with innovative action and humor, this cocktail hits its stride in the third film, which draws on everything we already know about the characters and then adds two new entire sets of toys to the plot. There's a new villain, two very amusing romance sub-plots and a litany of visual gags that push the envelope even further. I'm not allowed to go into any details but the second half of the film is a familiar set piece performed in a completely new way that will forever change your view of certain toys and day care centers.Apart from a level of animation that sets the bar in the industry and an attention to detail that makes you wonder what most ""real"" films actually do in pre-production, the real genius of the third film is to provide a satisfying conclusion that gives every character a completed character arc. About 20 minutes before the end, I was wondering how they would do this since there were some fairly dark moments (similar to those in Wall-E and Up), but naturally they manage to pull it together. There's literally not a single wasted shot, let alone a wasted scene, and the pace quickens throughout to keep the tension mounting.Overall, this is another Pixar classic that easily has enough for both kids and adults (and movie aficionados). It's not difficult to see why each of their movies takes five years to complete - yet despite the technical wizardry, the success of their movies is fundamentally routed in their stories, a fact which most other studios seem to forget these days. As to whether the stage is set for Toy Story 4, I suppose they could always pull it off given the creativity at work here, but I think there was a deliberate attempt to make this the last in the series.",5,A worthy completion of a classic trilogy,1276300800,"06 12, 2010",2010,2531,"['went', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Film', 'Festival', 'screening', 'Pixar', 'Studios', 'last', 'night', 'not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'expect', 'Toy', 'Story', 'been', '15', 'years', 'now', '20', 'terms', 'actual', 'development', 'had', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'maybe', 'character', 'potential', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'shameless', 'plot', 'Disney', 'exploit', 'franchise', 'Little', 'Mermaid', '3', 'anyone', 'Well', 'shame', 'underestimating', 'capabilities', 'Pixar', 'who', 'once', 'again', 'have', 'shown', 'how', 'small', 'studio', 'Emeryville', 'storytelling', 'powerhouse', 'rest', 'industry', 'dust.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'tale', 'Andy', 'toys', 'owner', 'going', 'college', 'quest', 'determine', 'future', 'headed', 'attic', 'daycare', 'center', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'way', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'blend', 'character', 'drama', 'innovative', 'action', 'humor', 'cocktail', 'stride', 'third', 'film', 'everything', 'already', 'know', 'characters', 'then', 'two', 'new', 'entire', 'sets', 'toys', 'plot', 'new', 'villain', 'two', 'very', 'amusing', 'romance', 'sub-plots', 'litany', 'visual', 'gags', 'push', 'envelope', 'even', 'further', ""'m"", 'not', 'allowed', 'go', 'details', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'familiar', 'set', 'piece', 'performed', 'completely', 'new', 'way', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'view', 'certain', 'toys', 'day', 'care', 'centers.Apart', 'level', 'animation', 'bar', 'industry', 'attention', 'detail', 'wonder', 'what', 'most', 'real', 'films', 'actually', 'do', 'pre-production', 'real', 'genius', 'third', 'film', 'provide', 'satisfying', 'conclusion', 'character', 'completed', 'character', 'arc', '20', 'minutes', 'end', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'would', 'do', 'were', 'fairly', 'dark', 'moments', 'similar', 'Wall-E', 'Up', 'naturally', 'manage', 'pull', 'together', 'literally', 'not', 'single', 'wasted', 'shot', 'let', 'alone', 'wasted', 'scene', 'pace', 'keep', 'tension', 'mounting.Overall', 'Pixar', 'classic', 'easily', 'enough', 'kids', 'adults', 'movie', 'aficionados', 'not', 'difficult', 'see', 'why', 'movies', 'five', 'years', 'complete', 'yet', 'technical', 'wizardry', 'success', 'movies', 'fundamentally', 'routed', 'stories', 'fact', 'most', 'other', 'studios', 'seem', 'forget', 'days', 'stage', 'set', 'Toy', 'Story', '4', 'suppose', 'could', 'always', 'pull', 'off', 'given', 'creativity', 'work', 'here', 'think', 'was', 'deliberate', 'attempt', 'make', 'last', 'series']",Toy Story 3

Just because Disney/Pixar is associated with a film is NOT license to expect one- to four-year-old toddlers to enjoy this film. Parents of toddlers will have their hands full and will have to give up before it's over. Here are some reasons why:* Abandonment issues are too complex; tots don't understand why the toys are angry, confused or traumatized.* They don't understand why Buzz Lightyear speaks Spanish after his reset button is pushed (and they can't read the captions).* They don't understand how that trash bag mix-up caused such a huge misunderstanding, or what the misunderstanding IS.* They don't understand how recycling facilities work and might find those scenes scary: the incinerator, the shredders and the magnets.Older children and adults, on the other hand, will relish the lessons in teamwork, loyalty, vanity, resourcefulness, tenacity, and good old-fashioned love. The final scene when our college-bound Andy, voiced again by John Morris (""Toy Story 2""), has to dispose of his childhood toys is poignant and heart-warming. Pixar can convey so much with a slight intake of breath or a sag of the shoulders as tension eases. In the theater, you could hear grown men sob. Watching your DVD from Amazon.com won't be quite so traumatic.The story is logical, as eleven years have passed since Toy Story 2, and the same terrific voice talents have returned: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, John Ratzenberger, and Don Rickles (among others). New players include Ned Beatty as the misleadingly cornpone huggy bear and Michael Keaton as Ken, who lives in Barbie's Dream House.

His Mom wants him to clear out his room before he goes -- anything that does not go with him or into the attic will keep trucked to the curb and out of his life forever. Obviously, this causes distress in his toy chest, whose denizens, while wildly loyal to Andy, have not been played with in years, and worry about what will happen to them. The movie spins out this drama believably and touchingly. The standard menagerie of Toy Story toys -- Woody, Buzz Lightyear, the slinky dog, Pig, and Dinosaur are all on hard. Along with a whole crew of nice and not-very-nice toys from a local daycare and at a local girl's house. And let's not forget to mention scene-stealing Barbie and Ken, with his enormous...wardrobe.Pixar has to be commended or taking an  old franchise and keeping it fresh.  There's enough danger, humor, genre allusions and prankishness for everyone to enjoy, old and young. The animation is firt rate. The work that went into Woody's loose-limbed gait was phenomenal. And some scenes that take place by the light of a glow-in-the-dark toy are breathtaking. The voicing was pitch-perfect, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen reprising their old roles without irony or fatigue. Some of the film is dark and scary, with its overtones of prison movies, which might frighten the really little kids who won't understand what is going on. And the numerous ""gay Ken"" allusions were tiresome. I saw the film in 3D which did little to enhance the jaw-dropping animation, great voicing, terrific characters and superb plot.A brilliant film, entertaining, affecting, gorgeously crafted and respectful of itself and its audience.",5,Great end to terrific franchise,1276992000,"06 20, 2010",2010,1750,"['Toy', 'Story', '3', 'spell', 'final', 'chapter', 'saga', 'Andy', 'toy', 'chest', 'Andy', 'now', '17', 'heading', 'off', 'college', 'Mom', 'clear', 'out', 'room', 'anything', 'not', 'go', 'attic', 'will', 'keep', 'trucked', 'curb', 'life', 'forever', 'Obviously', 'distress', 'toy', 'chest', 'denizens', 'wildly', 'loyal', 'Andy', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'played', 'years', 'worry', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'movie', 'out', 'drama', 'believably', 'touchingly', 'standard', 'menagerie', 'Toy', 'Story', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'slinky', 'dog', 'Pig', 'Dinosaur', 'are', 'hard', 'whole', 'crew', 'nice', 'not-very-nice', 'toys', 'local', 'daycare', 'local', 'girl', 'house', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'mention', 'scene-stealing', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'enormous', 'wardrobe.Pixar', 'be', 'commended', 'taking', 'old', 'franchise', 'keeping', 'fresh', 'enough', 'danger', 'humor', 'genre', 'allusions', 'prankishness', 'everyone', 'enjoy', 'old', 'young', 'animation', 'firt', 'rate', 'work', 'went', 'Woody', 'loose-limbed', 'gait', 'was', 'phenomenal', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'light', 'glow-in-the-dark', 'toy', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'voicing', 'was', 'pitch-perfect', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'reprising', 'old', 'roles', 'irony', 'fatigue', 'film', 'dark', 'scary', 'overtones', 'prison', 'movies', 'might', 'frighten', 'really', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'numerous', 'gay', 'Ken', 'allusions', 'were', 'tiresome', 'saw', 'film', '3D', 'did', 'little', 'enhance', 'jaw-dropping', 'animation', 'great', 'voicing', 'terrific', 'characters', 'superb', 'plot.A', 'brilliant', 'film', 'entertaining', 'affecting', 'gorgeously', 'crafted', 'respectful', 'audience']",Toy Story 3

I was the one, among many, who felt, ""finally, a movie that captures the wonder of a child!"" The creativity was miraculous, and over the years we have had the sequel to relish in, as it was a true sequel, not a dissapointment. And, perhaps, we would allow Pixar room to make one ""average"" movie, but no, they create the masterpiece simply called Toy Story 3. Nothing fancy, that's it, and I can't think of any better way. The business side is done, here's all the hard work in the movie.And Toy Story 3 has some enviable characters once again. Andy has not suddenly become the monster that he had feared, or the spoiled brat of a teenager that does not grasp the humanity within. No, Andy has grown up to become Jesus in my eyes. I'll try not to give spoilers, He must be somehow aware that Woody and the gang have feelings, or else he has such a heart, that even toys, without soul, without life, he humanizes and treats with dignity. Imagine the good deads this young man will do that are left to our imaginations. I think people register this well and the altruism is felt.I would not rate this movie higher than Toy Story as it is more sentimental for me. I grew up with that film and Toy Story 3 is new. This is a kids movie and kids do seem to love Toy Story 3. But saying that, Kids like me have grown up since the first and are coming to see this and are also enjoying it. Toy Story 3 doesn't seem to have better graphics than the second, and I'm sure that's the point. It retains the style that we identify with.This is a movie, that so many will enjoy with flawless happiness and without fault. Not everyone will approach it as the innocent movie for a younger audience, and might hold it in an inappropriate light. Some might spite all the reasons that have been unanimous, because of the seemingly unreproachable Pixar having so little resistance to criticism. No matter though, I am confident that all will find this movie to be enjoyable on some level.Pixar can't be touched, not even by a few reviwers on Rotten Tomatoes with seeming vendettas. Awards are something special for the fans and for the talented cast and crew and I'm sure Toy Story 3 will reap in its harvast of gold statuettes. But I can't help but think now, that there was much more they could have done. I thought if would have been artistically rewarding to push the limits a little harder. I know they are being true to the spirit of Toy Story-with its simpleness, but I put forth that maybe a little experimentation such as a dream scene of the toys in which the creators could have had freedom to make something artistic.Note: I saw this on premier weekend at the theater of my town.",5,"A happy story, sold as a farewell",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,2741,"['am', 'twenty', 'something', 'viewer', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'Toy', 'Story', 'loving', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'who', 'felt', 'finally', 'movie', 'wonder', 'child', 'creativity', 'was', 'miraculous', 'years', 'have', 'had', 'sequel', 'relish', 'was', 'true', 'sequel', 'not', 'dissapointment', 'perhaps', 'would', 'allow', 'Pixar', 'room', 'make', 'one', 'average', 'movie', 'create', 'masterpiece', 'simply', 'called', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Nothing', 'fancy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'way', 'business', 'side', 'done', 'here', 'hard', 'work', 'movie.And', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'enviable', 'characters', 'once', 'again', 'Andy', 'not', 'suddenly', 'become', 'monster', 'had', 'feared', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'teenager', 'not', 'grasp', 'humanity', 'No', 'Andy', 'grown', 'up', 'become', 'Jesus', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'try', 'not', 'give', 'spoilers', 'must', 'be', 'somehow', 'aware', 'Woody', 'gang', 'have', 'feelings', 'else', 'heart', 'even', 'soul', 'life', 'treats', 'dignity', 'Imagine', 'good', 'deads', 'young', 'man', 'will', 'do', 'are', 'left', 'imaginations', 'think', 'people', 'register', 'well', 'altruism', 'felt.I', 'would', 'not', 'rate', 'movie', 'higher', 'Toy', 'Story', 'more', 'sentimental', 'grew', 'up', 'film', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'new', 'kids', 'movie', 'kids', 'do', 'seem', 'love', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'saying', 'Kids', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'first', 'are', 'coming', 'see', 'are', 'also', 'enjoying', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'better', 'graphics', 'second', ""'m"", 'sure', 'point', 'style', 'identify', 'with.This', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'will', 'enjoy', 'flawless', 'happiness', 'fault', 'Not', 'everyone', 'will', 'approach', 'innocent', 'movie', 'younger', 'audience', 'might', 'hold', 'inappropriate', 'light', 'might', 'spite', 'reasons', 'have', 'been', 'unanimous', 'seemingly', 'unreproachable', 'Pixar', 'having', 'so', 'little', 'resistance', 'criticism', 'matter', 'am', 'confident', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'level.Pixar', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'touched', 'not', 'even', 'few', 'reviwers', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'seeming', 'vendettas', 'Awards', 'are', 'something', 'special', 'fans', 'talented', 'cast', 'crew', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'will', 'reap', 'harvast', 'gold', 'statuettes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'now', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'artistically', 'rewarding', 'push', 'limits', 'little', 'harder', 'know', 'are', 'being', 'true', 'spirit', 'Toy', 'Story-with', 'simpleness', 'put', 'forth', 'maybe', 'little', 'experimentation', 'such', 'dream', 'scene', 'toys', 'creators', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'freedom', 'make', 'something', 'artistic.Note', 'saw', 'premier', 'weekend', 'theater', 'town']",Toy Story 3

1253385,A9TG2NFA614S9,B00275EHJG,John F. Rooney,"[0, 0]","In Toy Story 3 (2010) Andy, the toys' owner, has grown-up and is going off to college. His mother tells him to decide what he wants to do with his toys, whether they should be donated, put up in the attic, or tossed out. What will become of the toys who need affection, but who never age but can get broken or worn out? The only one he has decided to take with him to college is Woody, the cowboy, who is a replica of a television puppet series character. Through a mix-up, the mother puts out with the rubbish a bag of toys meant for the attic. Luckily the toys escape from the jaws of the trash truck, but they blame Andy for throwing them out. They climb into a box meant for donation to a pre-school nursery.The toys are donated to Sunnyside Daycare. The boss of the toys there (a villain) is teddy-bear Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty). He makes sure that Andy's toys go in the room where a bunch of unruly kids are very rough on the toys and hurl them around. Woody helps to rescue them from this place of horrors. Buzz Lightyear is a featured toy. A new toy is introduced, Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), of the Barbie family, and he and Barbie click. Later there are some heart-stopping moments in the dump when you fear that the toys are going to end up in the jaws of the trash crusher.The tradition of high quality in this series is maintained in this which may be the last in the series. It is one of the best of the animated series ever made. It makes this gang of toys almost into real people with each of the toy characters having an individualized personality. Audiences get emotionally involved; they care about these toys as they would about people. The toys become a family and are interdependent. That is the magic of the films' creators. The voices of Tom Hanks and of the other major stars help to delineate these toy characters. And let's remember there's a lot of comedy in this enterprise.It's a highly imaginative, funny, and emotionally gripping story for adults as well as kids. It's an interesting ironic situation: the human beings are robotic and stagy: the toys are more human than the human beings.

1253386,AXOO7BPM22BDO,B00275EHJG,"John Green ""Darkwriter""","[10, 14]","Funny how time flies.  Once upon a time Toy Story's animation style was the leader of the pack and the state of the art, now it's considered standard fare.  But that's ok; once the shine and polish wore off of it the true value in the franchise was exactly what the title says- the Toys' Story.  Thankfully, that hasn't changed.The movie opens with an incredibly over-the-top playtime fantasy starring the entire cast that leaves you a little breathless and kinda nostalgic with some of the cameos involved.  The plot focuses upon the inevitable period of transition in life: Andy is heading off to college, leaving his childhood behind, and both he and his sister Molly have to decide what to do with their old toys. His destined for the attic, save Woody, whom Andy decides to take with him.  Molly donates hers to the local day care, including her Barbie doll (raise your hand if you can see it coming!).  A mistake has Andy's toys left out for garbage; Woody goes to rescue his friends and they manage to all end up at the day care center- a Garden of Eden for toys.  But there are snakes in the garden as things are not quite what they seem, leaving them worse off than before.  Now they have to find a way to escape and make it back to Andy's before he leaves.The typically superior Pixar animation is flawless, and the script is excellent- I'd have to say this was more for adults than kids. Woody remains his loyal, inventive self and there's always the iconic Buzz Lightyear gravity (and logic)-defying flight across the room.  Sight gags abound and one-liners zing, but the best laughs came from the running jokes about the inevitable `When Barbie meets Ken' scenario (""No one else around here understands clothes!""), as well as the age-old question about Ken- is he or isn't he?  There's also some hilarious moments surrounding the romance between Buzz and Jessie the Cowgirl: Buzz gets brainwashed by the bad guys and his friends need to restore him to normal.  A tip: try not to be eating anything once Buzz gets his buttons pushed.The key to the Toy Story movies is they never take themselves too seriously even in their sentimental and poignant moments, and there were quite a few of those here.  The villain's character arc is perfectly appropriate for a toy movie, and ties into the main plot of the toy's search for a new home.  The ending definitely tugs at your heart strings but works very well; I honestly couldn't see it coming out any other way.  And as is the current trend in movies, you definitely need to stick around for the credits!  Toy Story 3 runs the risk of being overshadowed by other flicks this summer, but it shouldn't be.

My wife and I enjoy it as much as our 3-year-old daughter. We watch this movie, on average since getting it, about three times a week. The toys and stories about playtime and adventures are enough to keep our daughter raptly attentive; the deeper stories about coming-of-age, separation anxiety, and finding your way in the world are well written and acted out for the adults. Some parts are a little darker than the first two movies and may elicit questions from older children, but all-in-all it's a fun and exciting movie.Needless to say, the blu-ray picture and sound are amazing. The amount of extras is impressive; you'll need to watch the extras on both the blu-ray disk and the dvd since they aren't (like with some packages) just repeats of the other disk.In the end, everyone ends up getting just what they need, even if they didn't realize earlier that it was what they wanted.This is, in my opinion, the perfect way to end the Toy Story series. (SPOILER ALERT!) The toys are still together and have someone who will love them and play with them; Andy is grown up and, while past the point of being able to love the toys, has fond memories of his time with them. Lotso gets his due and the other toys at SunnySide Day Care are free to live without the fear of his gang of thugs (who, it turns out, aren't that bad once the dictator is gone).I know it's a profitable franchise and an enjoyable series of good, wholesome family movies...but I hope the studio will realize that they've attained perfection with these three movies and not drive it into the ground by releasing additional movies just for the sake of making more money.

1253388,A356HRZZFCEGL1,B00275EHJG,"John Panagopoulos ""John Andrew Panagopoulos""","[1, 3]","***This review may contain spoilers***Let me establish at the outset that I have savored and appreciated all three ""Toy Story 3"" movies for their charm, latent sly satire, cliffhanging adventure, and vivid characters.  At the same time, however, the trilogy continues two dark, harsh themes - abandonment/death and set-in-stone villainy - without really addressing either one squarely.  As the trilogy progressed, first Woody, then Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl, then eventually ALL of the toys confronted abandonment, obsolesence, and even destruction.  The flaming inferno of the garbage incinerator at ""Toy Story 3""'s (hereafter TS3's) climax was an indelible symbol of toy oblivion.  But because TS3 is of course a Disney/Pixar movie, no toy buys the farm, not even the suavely ruthless Lotso Hugging Bear.  This is understandable; TS3 would have taken a dive profit-wise even if a minor toy character had been destroyed.  However, TS3 kicks the abandonment can down the road toward the movie's end, where young adult Andy bequeaths all his toys, even Woody whom he improbably wanted to take to college with him, to the little girl who was his neighbor.  Many viewers hail this as an intensely emotional scene, but I think the scene is somewhat overrated because we never knew enough about Andy to be emotionally invested in his sacrifice, and anyway the toys didn't really care about who played with them (as long as they were gentle, of course).  Furthermore, the abandonment issue is not resolved because someday the little girl will become a big girl, and the toys will have to face their abandonment/mortality all over again.  Perhaps that is TS3's morbid point.More distressing is the theme that permeates almost any Disney or Pixar animated feature - once a villain always a villain.  As far as I am aware, the only Disney animated villain, major or minor, who ever repented of his wickedness (at least kinda) was Iago the parrot in the Aladdin movies.  But in the Toy Story trilogy, neither Sid, nor Stinky Pete, nor Lotso rise above bitter evil vindictiveness.  In TS3, Lotso seemed to have a shot at redemption.  We learn of his and his giant baby doll henchman's abandonment by the side of a road by his thoughless female owner.  Woody saves Lotso's life from the conveyor belt leading to the incinerator.  But in the final analysis, the evil force is too strong with Lotso. He forsakes all the toys, compatriots and non-compatriots, to their fiery fate as he attempts to escape. Yet poetic justice intervenes; for his misdeeds, Lotso suffers, not fiery death, but perhaps a worse fate, being pinned to a bug-infested garbage truck grill with other unlucky stuffed animals.  I don't think irredeemable evil is a theme you should sell to impressionable young minds.  It would be nice to demonstrate that, yes, sometimes an evil character can atone for his misdeeds.I don't mean to make TS3 sound so sinister.  For the most part, it is light, cheery, upbeat, and howlingly funny (especially Mr. Potato Head's turn as Tortilla Man).  But it does have a dark underbelly, which in and of itself is not bad, and is actually commendable, but it does not directly deal with that underbelly, and that is not so commendable.3.5 stars out of five.",3,"Toy Story 3 continues the trilogy's two expanding, disturbing themes - Abandonment and Incorrigible Villainy",1321574400,"11 18, 2011",2011,3249,"['***This', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers***Let', 'establish', 'outset', 'have', 'savored', 'appreciated', 'three', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'movies', 'charm', 'latent', 'sly', 'satire', 'cliffhanging', 'adventure', 'vivid', 'characters', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'trilogy', 'two', 'dark', 'harsh', 'themes', 'abandonment/death', 'set-in-stone', 'villainy', 'really', 'addressing', 'one', 'squarely', 'trilogy', 'progressed', 'first', 'Woody', 'then', 'Jessie', 'Yodeling', 'Cowgirl', 'then', 'eventually', 'ALL', 'toys', 'confronted', 'abandonment', 'obsolesence', 'even', 'destruction', 'flaming', 'inferno', 'garbage', 'incinerator', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'hereafter', 'TS3', 'climax', 'was', 'indelible', 'symbol', 'toy', 'oblivion', 'TS3', 'course', 'Disney/Pixar', 'movie', 'toy', 'farm', 'not', 'even', 'suavely', 'ruthless', 'Lotso', 'Hugging', 'Bear', 'understandable', 'TS3', 'would', 'have', 'taken', 'dive', 'profit-wise', 'even', 'minor', 'toy', 'character', 'had', 'been', 'destroyed', 'However', 'TS3', 'abandonment', 'can', 'down', 'road', 'movie', 'end', 'where', 'young', 'adult', 'Andy', 'toys', 'even', 'Woody', 'whom', 'improbably', 'wanted', 'take', 'college', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'was', 'neighbor', 'Many', 'viewers', 'hail', 'intensely', 'emotional', 'scene', 'think', 'scene', 'somewhat', 'overrated', 'never', 'knew', 'enough', 'Andy', 'be', 'emotionally', 'invested', 'sacrifice', 'anyway', 'toys', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'who', 'played', 'as', 'long', 'were', 'gentle', 'course', 'Furthermore', 'abandonment', 'issue', 'not', 'resolved', 'because', 'little', 'girl', 'will', 'become', 'big', 'girl', 'toys', 'will', 'have', 'face', 'abandonment/mortality', 'over', 'again', 'Perhaps', 'TS3', 'morbid', 'point.More', 'distressing', 'theme', 'almost', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'animated', 'feature', 'once', 'villain', 'always', 'villain', 'As', 'far', 'am', 'aware', 'only', 'Disney', 'animated', 'villain', 'major', 'minor', 'who', 'ever', 'repented', 'wickedness', 'least', 'kinda', 'was', 'Iago', 'parrot', 'Aladdin', 'movies', 'Toy', 'Story', 'trilogy', 'Sid', 'Stinky', 'Pete', 'Lotso', 'rise', 'bitter', 'evil', 'vindictiveness', 'TS3', 'Lotso', 'seemed', 'have', 'shot', 'redemption', 'learn', 'giant', 'baby', 'doll', 'henchman', 'abandonment', 'side', 'road', 'thoughless', 'female', 'owner', 'Woody', 'Lotso', 'life', 'conveyor', 'belt', 'leading', 'incinerator', 'final', 'analysis', 'evil', 'force', 'too', 'strong', 'Lotso', 'toys', 'compatriots', 'non-compatriots', 'fiery', 'fate', 'escape', 'poetic', 'justice', 'intervenes', 'misdeeds', 'Lotso', 'suffers', 'not', 'fiery', 'death', 'perhaps', 'worse', 'fate', 'being', 'pinned', 'bug-infested', 'garbage', 'truck', 'grill', 'other', 'unlucky', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'irredeemable', 'evil', 'theme', 'should', 'sell', 'impressionable', 'young', 'minds', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'demonstrate', 'yes', 'sometimes', 'evil', 'character', 'can', 'atone', 'misdeeds.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'make', 'TS3', 'sound', 'so', 'sinister', 'most', 'part', 'light', 'cheery', 'upbeat', 'howlingly', 'funny', 'especially', 'Mr', 'Potato', 'Head', 'turn', 'Tortilla', 'Man', 'have', 'dark', 'underbelly', 'not', 'bad', 'actually', 'commendable', 'not', 'directly', 'deal', 'underbelly', 'not', 'so', 'commendable.3.5', 'stars', 'five']",Toy Story 3

So there is an age difference.  We all enjoyed it.  We laughed and really got into the story.  The strange thing though is that after like 45 minutes in I started to cry.  I couldn't believe it.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a drama.  But maybe it has a little bit here and there.  The movie is about Andy getting ready to go to college.  The toys just want him to pick them up and play with them.  As he is getting ready for school, his mom tells him he has to put stuff for the attic in the attic box, stuff he is taking with him in the college box and trash in the trash box.  The toys are all worried about where they will end up.  Things happen and the wrong thing gets put in the wrong spot and then the adventure begins.The toys need to find there way back to Andy.  At least some of them do.  After something happens, some just want to stay where they are.  They soon realize that the great new place they are may not be all they thought it was.  There are some crazy kids and an angry bear they have to deal with and figure out how to get out of the new prison and get back to Andy.  That is all I can say.  I don't want to tell you the whole movie.  As I said at the beginning, I cried.  Just the fact that he had to leave his stuff and they were lonely made me sad.  I was going to come home and take my collectable stuff ut of the box because I felt bad for it!  That's strange I know. I have the DVDs of the firs two.  I don't remember if they made me feel a little pity or sadness.  It's great for the kids because it is funny and memorable.  It is the same for the adults, while at the same time it may make them think about being a  kid and bring some great memories from your past.

1253395,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B00275EHJG,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 1]","I grew up with the characters of Toy Story; the first film being released when I was 3, the second when I was 7, and the third months after I turned 18. With that in mind, it's worth noting that there's an added pathos to the proceedings in that regard. Toy Story 3 is Pixar's conclusion to their Toy Story films and while many studios could have just made a cash-grab based on an established name, Pixar has produced one of the best ""threequels"" you could hope to find. The film is the highest grossing movie of 2010 and it's been established by audiences and critics that saying a negative word about it is hearsay; but, luckily, that's not necessary here.Andy is now all grown up and off to college, while his favorite toys have been cast off into the toybox hoping for the off-chance that Andy will play with them again. Planning to take his favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) to college with him and putting the rest of the gang in the attic, a mistake leads all the toys to end up at Sunnyside Daycare. A new villain emerges as the soft-spoken, purple teddy bear Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) along with his henchmen Big Baby and Ken (Michael Keaton).All of the main characters and voice cast from the previous two films return (with the exception of the late Jim Varney) and none of the charm of the original films has been lost. The toys really take center stage in this film, with very little human involvement this time around. In terms of storytelling quality and execution, Toy Story 3 is exactly what you'd come to expect from Pixar studios. Endlessly creative in their endeavors, I found the new toy additions brilliantly used (my favorites being Chuckles the Clown and the ""eye in the sky"" Monkey).It's a wonderfully creative film that I enjoyed even more the second time around. It's got a witty, poignant script by Oscar-winning screenwriter Michael Arndt ('Little Miss Sunshine'), sight gags that are as amusing as ever, and voice work by actors who haved stayed with these characters for over 15 years yet never lose their energy and flair. The latest voice actors to join are particularly good, notably Ned Beatty, alternating between comforting and sinister and Michael Keaton, a total scene-stealer.As I mentioned earlier, growing up with these films in the way I have has added a significant amount of pathos. This is not more apparent than it is at the film's conclusion. The conclusion of Toy Story 3 is one of the most heartwrenching scenes I've ever encountered in an animated film. It may be because it seems symbolic of my own childhood ending or that it's just a really well-executed conclusion, but whatever the case...I can't help but be impressed by an animated film that nearly moves me to tears.Toy Story 3 is not my favorite film of 2010 or even my favorite animated film of 2010, but I have to agree with the general consensus that it's one of the best films of 2010. An entertaining, amusing, exciting, crowd-pleasing close to an iconic trilogy of films that will appeal to both adults and children alike. There really isn't a negative thing to say about it.GRADE: A-",5,"One of the Best ""Threequels"" You Could Hope to Find",1294099200,"01 4, 2011",2011,3100,"['grew', 'up', 'characters', 'Toy', 'Story', 'first', 'film', 'being', 'released', 'when', 'was', '3', 'second', 'when', 'was', '7', 'third', 'months', 'turned', '18', 'mind', 'worth', 'noting', 'added', 'pathos', 'proceedings', 'regard', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Pixar', 'conclusion', 'Toy', 'Story', 'films', 'many', 'studios', 'could', 'have', 'just', 'made', 'cash-grab', 'based', 'established', 'name', 'Pixar', 'produced', 'one', 'best', 'threequels', 'could', 'hope', 'find', 'film', 'highest', 'grossing', 'movie', '2010', 'been', 'established', 'audiences', 'critics', 'saying', 'negative', 'word', 'hearsay', 'luckily', 'not', 'necessary', 'here.Andy', 'now', 'grown', 'up', 'college', 'favorite', 'toys', 'have', 'been', 'cast', 'off', 'toybox', 'hoping', 'off-chance', 'Andy', 'will', 'play', 'again', 'Planning', 'take', 'favorite', 'toy', 'Woody', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'college', 'putting', 'rest', 'gang', 'attic', 'mistake', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'Sunnyside', 'Daycare', 'new', 'villain', 'soft-spoken', 'purple', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Lotso', 'voiced', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'henchmen', 'Big', 'Baby', 'Ken', 'Michael', 'Keaton', '.All', 'main', 'characters', 'voice', 'cast', 'previous', 'two', 'films', 'return', 'exception', 'late', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'none', 'charm', 'original', 'films', 'been', 'lost', 'toys', 'really', 'take', 'center', 'stage', 'film', 'very', 'little', 'human', 'involvement', 'time', 'around', 'terms', 'storytelling', 'quality', 'execution', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'come', 'expect', 'Pixar', 'studios', 'Endlessly', 'creative', 'endeavors', 'found', 'new', 'toy', 'additions', 'brilliantly', 'used', 'favorites', 'being', 'Chuckles', 'Clown', 'eye', 'sky', 'Monkey', '.It', 'wonderfully', 'creative', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'time', 'got', 'witty', 'poignant', 'script', 'Oscar-winning', 'screenwriter', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 'Miss', 'Sunshine', 'sight', 'gags', 'are', 'as', 'amusing', 'ever', 'voice', 'work', 'actors', 'who', 'haved', 'stayed', 'characters', '15', 'years', 'yet', 'never', 'lose', 'energy', 'flair', 'latest', 'voice', 'actors', 'join', 'are', 'particularly', 'good', 'notably', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'alternating', 'comforting', 'sinister', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'total', 'scene-stealer.As', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'growing', 'up', 'films', 'way', 'have', 'added', 'significant', 'amount', 'pathos', 'not', 'more', 'apparent', 'film', 'conclusion', 'conclusion', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'one', 'most', 'heartwrenching', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'encountered', 'animated', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'symbolic', 'own', 'childhood', 'ending', 'just', 'really', 'well-executed', 'conclusion', 'case', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'animated', 'film', 'nearly', 'tears.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', '2010', 'even', 'favorite', 'animated', 'film', '2010', 'have', 'agree', 'general', 'consensus', 'one', 'best', 'films', '2010', 'entertaining', 'amusing', 'exciting', 'crowd-pleasing', 'close', 'iconic', 'trilogy', 'films', 'will', 'appeal', 'adults', 'children', 'alike', 'really', ""n't"", 'negative', 'thing', 'say', 'it.GRADE', 'A-']",Toy Story 3
1253396,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B00275EHJG,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[30, 42]","I remember when Toy Story was first released and I actually had stock in Pixar.  Sadly I sold the stock but Pixar just keeps making fantastic movies.  I admittedly went into Toy Story III with low expectations.  It is the third film in a series which usually marks the demise.  Nothing ever seems as good as the original.  Somehow Pixar avoids the clich&eacute;'s and has managed to produce a movie that adults will most likely enjoy as well as kids.  Having three daughters of my own, one who is sixteen, I can relate wholeheartedly to the story.Andy is seventeen and is on his way to college.  He is making the transition to adulthood which means letting your childhood go.  Along with his adolescence he is also saying goodbye to his toys.  The opening scene is a marvelous fantasy depicting all the toys in a wonderfully scenario of good guys versus bad.  Some of the toys being on the side of the law and some finding a darker route, but it is all in good fun.  As the dream sequence wraps up, we find out it is really the toys who are desperately trying to get Andy to play with them, one final time before he packs them away in the attic or sends them off to the trash heap.As seems to typically happen with Andy's toys, something goes amiss and they find their way to a daycare center, where they are subjected to severe beatings and destructive activity from toddlers.  Anyone who has kids can relate to the age when they beat and chewed on anything within their grasp.  The center is ran by a purple stuffed bear who had his heart broken after being forgotten one day on picnic outing.  He is a bitter angry old bear and takes his frustration out on anyone and everyone in his path.I loved them using the baby as the bruiser in the movie.  Seeing this big plastic headed diaper wearing baby gooooing and ahhing while picking up toys a quarter his size and shoving them in a cage was too funny.  I have to admit that Barbie and Ken stole the show in their scenes where they expressed their love, and in one sequence where Ken tried on some of his extensive wardrobe.  Some of those clothes actually did bring back memories and I laughed out loud when Ken loudly expressed he was not a girl's toy.  It seems even Ken has some gender issues.My favorite part of the entire movie was watching Buzz Lightyear get switched into Spanish mode and listening to him spout off his love for Jesse while reading the subtitles.  It wasn't just his verbiage but his salsa dancing as he swept Jesse off her feet doing what appeared to be a Tango.  It was too funny for words but was followed up by many other things both subtle and not so subtle that kept you laughing.  As only Pixar seems to be able to do, they told a story that was touching, funny, and all so relevant to real life.In the end, Andy ventures off to college and leaves behind not only his toys but his parents, his house and his past.  As all kids do, he ventured out to find himself and figure out his own life so hopefully he would way day be an adult with the rest of us.  In one of the most touching moments I have seen in any animated film ever, he hands off his precious toys one by one to a neighborhood girl who will appreciate them and play with them as he no longer can.  At his age he is moving on for his own good and letting go of the past for the happiness of the toys as well.While the 3D affects are ok, the movie is not ground breaking in any visual way but the story is what has always held Pixar aloft of any competitors.  They seem to have this knack for hitting a home run and with Toy Story III they have not let us down in any way.  If you have kids then use them as an excuse to see the movie.  They will enjoy it and most adults should really appreciate it as they will most likely be trying not to cry at the end.Don't expect any huge actions scenes, or gun play, or violent undertones.  Just expect a wholesome, clean, wonderful movie that will touch your heart and keep the kids entertained for a couple of hours.",5,Pixar at its Best,1276819200,"06 18, 2010",2010,4003,"['remember', 'when', 'Toy', 'Story', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'actually', 'had', 'stock', 'Pixar', 'Sadly', 'sold', 'stock', 'Pixar', 'just', 'making', 'fantastic', 'movies', 'admittedly', 'went', 'Toy', 'Story', 'III', 'low', 'expectations', 'third', 'film', 'series', 'usually', 'demise', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Somehow', 'Pixar', 'clich', 'eacute', 'managed', 'produce', 'movie', 'adults', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'enjoy', 'as', 'well', 'kids', 'Having', 'three', 'daughters', 'own', 'one', 'who', 'sixteen', 'can', 'relate', 'wholeheartedly', 'story.Andy', 'seventeen', 'way', 'college', 'making', 'transition', 'adulthood', 'letting', 'childhood', 'go', 'adolescence', 'also', 'saying', 'goodbye', 'toys', 'opening', 'scene', 'marvelous', 'fantasy', 'depicting', 'toys', 'wonderfully', 'scenario', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'toys', 'being', 'side', 'law', 'finding', 'darker', 'route', 'all', 'good', 'fun', 'dream', 'sequence', 'wraps', 'up', 'find', 'really', 'toys', 'who', 'are', 'desperately', 'trying', 'get', 'Andy', 'play', 'one', 'final', 'time', 'away', 'attic', 'off', 'trash', 'heap.As', 'typically', 'happen', 'Andy', 'toys', 'something', 'amiss', 'find', 'way', 'daycare', 'center', 'where', 'are', 'subjected', 'severe', 'beatings', 'destructive', 'activity', 'toddlers', 'Anyone', 'who', 'kids', 'can', 'relate', 'age', 'when', 'beat', 'chewed', 'anything', 'grasp', 'center', 'ran', 'purple', 'stuffed', 'bear', 'who', 'had', 'heart', 'broken', 'being', 'forgotten', 'one', 'day', 'picnic', 'outing', 'bitter', 'angry', 'old', 'bear', 'frustration', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'path.I', 'loved', 'using', 'baby', 'bruiser', 'movie', 'Seeing', 'big', 'plastic', 'headed', 'diaper', 'wearing', 'baby', 'gooooing', 'ahhing', 'picking', 'up', 'quarter', 'size', 'shoving', 'cage', 'was', 'too', 'funny', 'have', 'admit', 'Barbie', 'Ken', 'stole', 'show', 'scenes', 'where', 'expressed', 'love', 'one', 'sequence', 'where', 'Ken', 'tried', 'extensive', 'wardrobe', 'clothes', 'actually', 'did', 'bring', 'back', 'memories', 'laughed', 'out', 'loud', 'when', 'Ken', 'loudly', 'expressed', 'was', 'not', 'girl', 'toy', 'even', 'Ken', 'gender', 'issues.My', 'favorite', 'part', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'watching', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'get', 'switched', 'Spanish', 'mode', 'listening', 'spout', 'off', 'love', 'Jesse', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'verbiage', 'salsa', 'dancing', 'swept', 'Jesse', 'feet', 'doing', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'Tango', 'was', 'too', 'funny', 'words', 'was', 'followed', 'up', 'many', 'other', 'things', 'subtle', 'not', 'so', 'subtle', 'kept', 'laughing', 'only', 'Pixar', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'told', 'story', 'was', 'touching', 'funny', 'so', 'relevant', 'real', 'life.In', 'end', 'Andy', 'ventures', 'college', 'leaves', 'not', 'only', 'toys', 'parents', 'house', 'past', 'kids', 'do', 'ventured', 'out', 'find', 'figure', 'out', 'own', 'life', 'so', 'hopefully', 'would', 'way', 'day', 'be', 'adult', 'rest', 'one', 'most', 'touching', 'moments', 'have', 'seen', 'animated', 'film', 'ever', 'precious', 'toys', 'one', 'one', 'neighborhood', 'girl', 'who', 'will', 'appreciate', 'play', 'no', 'longer', 'can', 'age', 'moving', 'own', 'good', 'letting', 'go', 'past', 'happiness', 'toys', '3D', 'affects', 'are', 'ok', 'movie', 'not', 'ground', 'breaking', 'visual', 'way', 'story', 'what', 'always', 'held', 'Pixar', 'aloft', 'competitors', 'seem', 'have', 'knack', 'hitting', 'home', 'run', 'Toy', 'Story', 'III', 'have', 'not', 'let', 'down', 'way', 'have', 'kids', 'then', 'use', 'excuse', 'see', 'movie', 'will', 'enjoy', 'most', 'adults', 'should', 'really', 'appreciate', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'trying', 'not', 'cry', 'end.Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'huge', 'actions', 'scenes', 'gun', 'play', 'violent', 'undertones', 'Just', 'expect', 'wholesome', 'clean', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'will', 'touch', 'heart', 'keep', 'kids', 'entertained', 'couple', 'hours']",Toy Story 3

The immense critical success of a third film in a trilogy? Or am I simply speaking of the incredible blend of entertainment for the third consecutive time in a series for children and adults alike. I was fortunate enough to experience this trilogy from childhood to adulthood, although I really grew up watching Disney's classic traditionally animated films, which have now become more or less obsolete. The rage of 3 dimensional computer animated films has been in full swing since after the original Toy Story was released in 1995 and blew minds, now that a revolutionary 3D technology has been introduced to cinemas it's becoming even more popular. Pixar has achieved what has been perceived as almost impossible by producing hit after hit after hit, financially and critically, some not as much as others. The only way to understand Toy Story 3 and the impact and significance of the series it is to see the first 2 films, highly recommended in Blu-Ray or 3D. After being introduced to many lovable characters in the Toy Story cast and growing up with them, a big theme in the franchise, they become like intimate pals, characters that you can rely on to be the same time and time again. What this 3rd and almost assuredly final film does is take you to a very, very real and inevitable place, an ending. This can be a hard thing to accept because like many things in life you don't want this journey to end but like all things in life it has to at some point or another. After being attached to characters like this and seeing it all come to an end it is quite hard to keep a dry eye throughout the course of the film.

1253401,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B00275EHJG,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[6, 9]","TOY STORY 3 is the perfect bow completing the Toy Story package.  My mother, 13 year old daughter, 5 year old daughter and I all loved every minute of it.  TOY STORY 3 made all three generations of my family laugh, cry, and cheer.  Yes, the story is basically the same story told in the other two movies - the toys have to get back to Andy - but we certainly didn't care.  Disney has pulled off a perfect hat trick, a golden triple crown with the Toy Story trio, and they are all endearing family movies.  And it is possible that TOY STORY 3 is the best of them all.TOY STORY 3 is clearly meant to be the end of the Toy Story saga:  Andy is going off to college (really?  It seems that just yesterday he was 6 years old and getting a Buzz Lightyear doll...where does the time go???).  Andy must decide what to do with his favorite toys; he hasn't played with them in years, but they are still his favorites and have sentimental value.  What should he do with them?  Through an unfortunate but completely plausible mistake, the toys end up donated to a preschool.  Although most of the toys believe Andy sent them there on purpose, Woody is ever loyal, and knows that this is not the case.  He finally convinces the others of their error, and now, of course, the toys must get back to Andy before he leaves for college.  Will they ever get home?  Will they get there safely?  Will they make it before Andy leaves?  What will become of them?TOY STORY 3 is delightful entertainment for the entire family.  Disney does many things right, but their stories with the message of being true to yourself and true to your friends are always outstanding.  These messages are so important for young kids, and Disney tells them well and memorably, in many forms.  And TOY STORY 3 is one of their best.With outstanding vocal talent, including the return of Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear, young and old alike will are sure to enjoy this adorable, sentimental, and funny flim.  The story is typical happy ending Disney, the animation is excellent, the 3-D effects are great, and the messages are perfect.  Added to that are some wonderful gags that will leave you laughing until you cry.  Look for guest appearances from many toys from your childhood; they will bring back many happy memories and lots of giggles.  Especially endearing was the return of Barbie, who at long last met her Ken.  Their interaction, as well as Barbie's stunning declaration that ""Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force!"" (she really has brains under all that blond hair!), is hysterical and memorable.Take lots of tissues to TOY STORY 3, especially if you have a child who has left for college.  Andy makes a beautiful decision in the end, and clearly, all the toys we have come to love will live happily ever after.  Well done, Disney.  The entire TOY STORY trilogy is a true classic, one that will be loved by generations to come.",5,"A Sentimental, Heartwarming, Joyful Good Time",1279238400,"07 16, 2010",2010,2964,"['TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'perfect', 'bow', 'completing', 'Toy', 'Story', 'package', 'mother', '13', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', '5', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'loved', 'minute', 'TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'made', 'three', 'generations', 'family', 'laugh', 'cry', 'cheer', 'Yes', 'story', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'told', 'other', 'two', 'movies', 'toys', 'have', 'get', 'back', 'Andy', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Disney', 'pulled', 'off', 'perfect', 'hat', 'trick', 'golden', 'triple', 'crown', 'Toy', 'Story', 'trio', 'are', 'endearing', 'family', 'movies', 'possible', 'TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'best', 'all.TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'clearly', 'meant', 'be', 'end', 'Toy', 'Story', 'saga', 'Andy', 'going', 'off', 'college', 'really', 'just', 'yesterday', 'was', '6', 'years', 'old', 'getting', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'doll', 'where', 'time', 'go', 'Andy', 'must', 'decide', 'what', 'do', 'favorite', 'toys', ""n't"", 'played', 'years', 'are', 'still', 'favorites', 'have', 'sentimental', 'value', 'What', 'should', 'do', 'unfortunate', 'completely', 'plausible', 'mistake', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'donated', 'preschool', 'most', 'toys', 'believe', 'Andy', 'sent', 'purpose', 'Woody', 'ever', 'loyal', 'not', 'case', 'finally', 'others', 'error', 'now', 'course', 'toys', 'must', 'get', 'back', 'Andy', 'college', 'ever', 'get', 'home', 'Will', 'get', 'there', 'safely', 'Will', 'make', 'Andy', 'What', 'will', 'become', 'TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'delightful', 'entertainment', 'entire', 'family', 'Disney', 'many', 'things', 'right', 'stories', 'message', 'being', 'true', 'yourself', 'true', 'friends', 'are', 'always', 'outstanding', 'messages', 'are', 'so', 'important', 'young', 'kids', 'Disney', 'well', 'memorably', 'many', 'forms', 'TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'one', 'best.With', 'outstanding', 'vocal', 'talent', 'including', 'return', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Woody', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'will', 'are', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'adorable', 'sentimental', 'funny', 'flim', 'story', 'typical', 'happy', 'ending', 'Disney', 'animation', 'excellent', '3-D', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'messages', 'are', 'perfect', 'Added', 'are', 'wonderful', 'gags', 'will', 'leave', 'laughing', 'cry', 'Look', 'guest', 'appearances', 'many', 'toys', 'childhood', 'will', 'bring', 'back', 'many', 'happy', 'memories', 'lots', 'giggles', 'Especially', 'endearing', 'was', 'return', 'Barbie', 'who', 'long', 'last', 'met', 'Ken', 'interaction', 'as', 'well', 'Barbie', 'stunning', 'declaration', 'Authority', 'should', 'derive', 'consent', 'governed', 'not', 'threat', 'force', 'really', 'brains', 'blond', 'hair', 'hysterical', 'memorable.Take', 'lots', 'tissues', 'TOY', 'STORY', '3', 'especially', 'have', 'child', 'who', 'left', 'college', 'Andy', 'beautiful', 'decision', 'end', 'clearly', 'toys', 'have', 'come', 'love', 'will', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'Well', 'done', 'Disney', 'entire', 'TOY', 'STORY', 'trilogy', 'true', 'classic', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'loved', 'generations', 'come']",Toy Story 3

We become part of it.  And in the hands of Pixar, that is never a bad thing.  I think what distinguishes this film from the previous two, other than the leap in animation technology and the studio's experience  in telling stories, is the wicked sense of humor in this screenplay.  And executing that humor in a script which  appeals to at least three generations of moviegoers without letting it be at the expense of the younger audience.Andy's leaving home.  Without giving away too much of the plot, what we see here is a sensitive lesson in the difference in loss from abandonment and neglect, and loss from growing up and moving on.  And the difference between the two.  The storyline with Lotso demonstrates that you can't always read a book by it's cover, and that bullies can smell like strawberries too.  That big babies can be evil when they fall in with the wrong crowd.  Ken modeling his wardrobe for Barbie shows that even macho guys like Ken have a weakness for clothes.  And Spanish Space men make cowgirls go weak in the knees, especially in dangerous situations.  I haven't laughed this hard since seeing Lucy and Ethel dance on grapes, and haven't cried this hard since the beginning of the mortgage crisis.People die.  Kids leave home.  Recycling is good.  And if you bully the other kids too much, you just might end up being a hood ornament on a garbage truck.  Thanks Pixar.

1253411,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B00275EHJG,Kevin J. Loria,"[3, 4]","First let me say: Toy Story 3 is another Pixar masterpiece and the perfect way to close a franchise started in 1995. Randy Newman's ""You've got a friend in me"" warms the heart today as it first did 15 years ago.Now with that out of the way let me call attention to the films lead-in...Pixar continues another tradition here with is the animated short that precedes the feature (like Luxo Jr. where the Studio's logo comes from). Toy Story 3's short is called ""Day & Night"" and raises the bar for future Pixar shorts and will likely get many Academy nomination for it's efforts.  I think the 3-D may work more effectively with the short than the sequel itself. ""Day & Night"" is more complicated a concept than you'd expect considering it involves two mute characters struggling to coexist. One character consists, literally of daytime images while his counterpart is made of night images.  Although the two characters are little more than retro-cartoon silhouettes, they are filled with complex animated scenes within their own animation. They shift positions and move around one another creating some fascinating visuals for us. Equally simple is it's message for  folks to overcome their fear of the  differences in others and the unknown. Day & Night is simply the best short I've seen from Pixar to dateNow with that out of the way, Toy Story 3 reunites us with old friends: Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Hamm, Rex, Mr. & Mrs. Potato Head, each voiced by their original actors (except the late Jim Varney). Surprisingly, the Toys owner Andy, now grown up and ready to start college is still voiced by the same actor John Morris (who started at around 11 in the first film).  It seems the concept of toys coming to life when people aren't look would become tired after 2 films, but I have to say that is not the case here. After a super opening sequence, an homage to Woody's opening adventure in the original film, the toys end up at Daycare run like a prison by a naughty Teddy Bear (voiced by Ned Beatty). Naturally the Toys want to escape; the break-out plan doesn't go quite as planned by makes for some funny tributes to the prison movie genre (including a harmonica playin' Hamm). More classic toys turn up like the old Fisher-Price rolling phone and cymbal-monkey as an ever watchful prison guard. Barbie's Ken even turns up voiced gloriously campy by Michael Keaton, definitely emerging as the film's breakout toy characterization. The visuals are more amazing than ever, the humans look so much better than the original, it may become difficult to watch those older sequences after seeing ""3.""

But I loved the movie and even bought Buzz Lightyear and Woody dolls.Then I had kids and I loved sharing the movies with them. My son often thought that the first Toy Story was pretty creepy because of the toys Sid created.My kids (ages 6 and 11) and I went to see Toy Story 3 in the theater. The story unraveled in front of me and I found myself thinking nostalgically about my own kids and the toys they've already grown out of. Which ones will they want to keep, to give away, to take to college? I love how Andy stayed true to himself and his love for Woody and Buzz. The day care was wonderful and the scenes with Ken and Barbie hilarious - especially the one where he showcases all his outfits. It took me back to my childhood when I played with Barbie dolls. My favorite was Buzz in Spanish mode.The story was harrowing at times like in the garbage incinerator, but most of all remained faithful to the characters all the way to the end. I loved the ending and cried in the theater like every other mom in there. I cry at home watching it too since it represents the passing of all stages of life.I couldn't have imagined a better ending if someone asked me to write it myself (which luckily for everyone concerned, they did not).What an honorable way to handle the series, characters and fan base.I love getting the four disc combo because I have a Blu-ray for playing at home, a DVD to play on long car trips, the extras, and a digital copy for my iPod classic.",5,I Couldn't Have Written a Better Ending,1294790400,"01 12, 2011",2011,1533,"['did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'children', 'when', 'first', 'Toy', 'Story', 'came', 'out', 'loved', 'movie', 'even', 'bought', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'Woody', 'dolls.Then', 'had', 'kids', 'loved', 'sharing', 'movies', 'son', 'often', 'thought', 'first', 'Toy', 'Story', 'was', 'pretty', 'creepy', 'toys', 'Sid', 'created.My', 'kids', 'ages', '6', '11', 'went', 'see', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'theater', 'story', 'unraveled', 'front', 'found', 'thinking', 'nostalgically', 'own', 'kids', 'toys', ""'ve"", 'already', 'grown', 'Which', 'ones', 'will', 'want', 'keep', 'give', 'away', 'take', 'college', 'love', 'how', 'Andy', 'stayed', 'true', 'love', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'day', 'care', 'was', 'wonderful', 'scenes', 'Ken', 'Barbie', 'hilarious', 'especially', 'one', 'where', 'outfits', 'took', 'back', 'childhood', 'when', 'played', 'Barbie', 'dolls', 'favorite', 'was', 'Buzz', 'Spanish', 'mode.The', 'story', 'was', 'harrowing', 'times', 'garbage', 'incinerator', 'most', 'remained', 'faithful', 'characters', 'way', 'end', 'loved', 'ending', 'cried', 'theater', 'other', 'mom', 'there', 'cry', 'home', 'watching', 'too', 'passing', 'stages', 'life.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'imagined', 'better', 'ending', 'someone', 'asked', 'write', 'luckily', 'everyone', 'concerned', 'did', 'not', 'honorable', 'way', 'handle', 'series', 'characters', 'fan', 'base.I', 'getting', 'four', 'disc', 'combo', 'have', 'Blu-ray', 'playing', 'home', 'DVD', 'play', 'long', 'car', 'trips', 'extras', 'digital', 'copy', 'iPod', 'classic']",Toy Story 3

Judging by the glowing reviews this movie (and its predecessors ""Up"" and ""Wall-E"") have received, I'm in the minority in not liking this movie.  I just found it to be an overly long, sad, morbid, dark and incredibly depressing movie, despite its attempt at an uplifting ending.  Picture the Emily and Jessie abandonment scene from Toy Story 2, dragged out for an hour and 40 minutes...thats what this film is like.  Kind of like ""Up"" cast with Toy Story characters.  Even in the extras, the cast and crew are talking about how sad, and ""bittersweet"" the experience was. Again, where's the fun, the magic?Its a long, drawn-out goodbye scene with creepy evil toys, dark scenery, gambling, raging infernos, etc. thrown in.  Pixar movies used to make you feel young at heart, now all they seem to want to do is feel old. And I'm not ready to feel that way watching a Toy Story movie, so I doubt I'll ever watch this installment again.  I wouldn't recommend it for very young kids either due to some intense scenes, and also due to the fact that the movie is just flat-out not fun.But take my dissenting opinion with a grain of salt, as of this review I'm only the 5th one-star reviewer so I guess I just dont ""get it,"" or I'm just one of the rare people that still want to experience that fun Pixar magic when I'm watching Toy Story.

1253420,A120V3RVSK1O1K,B00275EHJG,K. Ostrowski,"[0, 0]","The final film in a trilogy of movies about a group of beloved toys, who come to life when no people are around, and find their fulfillment in being played with.  The main characters are the cowboy Woody, the cowgirl Jesse and the space ranger action figure Buzz Lightyear, and when their owner, Andy, has grown old enough to go to college, he's forced to make a choice; throw his old toys away, put them in the attic, give them away, or take them with him.Through a series of misunderstandings and tragic occurrances, the toys all end up being donated to a day care center, where toys can just keep being played with by new kids every year.  However, the toy bear who runs the place; Lots-o, tricks the main characters and tries to force them into the toddler room; where the children have no understanding of how to treat toys, and no respect for their playthings.When Woody realizes that his friends are in trouble, he finds himself having to perform a daring secret mission to rescue them from the mafia-boss-like teddy bear, and fix his friend Buzz; who's been severely brainwashed by them.Part of the reason for the grade I give this movie is that it has little or no philosophy to teach; no real lessons to learn, or morals to the story, exactly; at least none that are clear.  Another reason is that really, this is a kids' movie.  Not all pixar movies are that, but this has been consistent, anyway, throughout the Toy Story series.The movie uses a lot of cliches about mobs, gangsters and prison breaks, and applies them to toys, which is certainly odd, but workable.  The characters, for the most part, are predictable, and there are no real curve balls in the story.  Everything plays out pretty much exactly as you expect it to.There's a Ken doll in this film, who falls for a Barbie doll, and is torn between his love for her and his loyalty to the gang.  There's a running joke about this character being somewhat effeminate, which almost threatens to become tasteless, but never quite gets there.  On the whole, I'm somewhat up in the air about him.  I didn't find him particularly funny, but neither did I find him offensive, nor problematic for young children.I did feel that the whole mafia motif only worked marginally well.  Frankly, I think including it in a kid's film at all was a bit much, but it doesn't ruin the movie or anything.  It's still fun.  I just felt a little uncomfortable with it.On the whole, however, this is another movie about the toy story characters having fun and going on adventures, and it does that reasonably well.  It builds tension where tension is needed, has good humor where good humor is needed, and is just entertaining and exciting overall.I don't think this movie has any major shortcomings to speak of, but one thing I did notice was that where the first two films focused on developing the characters of Woody, Buzz and Jesse, this one has almost no development on the part of any of them.  They go through tough times and harrowing adventures, but as people, they don't really change.The one character who seems to get the most focus in the villain; Lots-o, and he's where the film makes its story happen; comparing the villain's own development to that of healthier-minded toys.  What follows from this is...  Well, I won't give it away, but to sum it up, the last two films wrapped character development in adventure.  This one is more of a character -study- wrapped in adventure.  There's no real development to speak of.And it's not as though they couldn't have included some.  Woody, in this film, faces the hard reality of his owner having grown up, and no longer needing him; the very same reality that Jesse faced in the last film; yet not a word is shared between them about it.  As I said, it was still a good film, but if this kind of opportunity had been taken advantage of, it would have been the icing on the cake.",4,"No Big Shortcomings, But Not What the Last Two Were",1344556800,"08 10, 2012",2012,3890,"['final', 'film', 'trilogy', 'movies', 'group', 'beloved', 'toys', 'who', 'come', 'life', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'around', 'find', 'fulfillment', 'being', 'played', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'cowboy', 'Woody', 'cowgirl', 'Jesse', 'space', 'ranger', 'action', 'figure', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'when', 'owner', 'Andy', 'grown', 'old', 'enough', 'go', 'college', 'forced', 'make', 'choice', 'throw', 'old', 'away', 'put', 'attic', 'give', 'away', 'take', 'series', 'misunderstandings', 'tragic', 'occurrances', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'donated', 'day', 'care', 'center', 'where', 'toys', 'can', 'just', 'keep', 'being', 'played', 'new', 'kids', 'year', 'However', 'toy', 'bear', 'who', 'place', 'Lots-o', 'main', 'characters', 'tries', 'force', 'toddler', 'room', 'where', 'children', 'have', 'understanding', 'how', 'treat', 'toys', 'respect', 'playthings.When', 'Woody', 'friends', 'are', 'trouble', 'having', 'perform', 'daring', 'secret', 'mission', 'rescue', 'mafia-boss-like', 'teddy', 'bear', 'fix', 'friend', 'Buzz', 'who', 'been', 'severely', 'brainwashed', 'them.Part', 'reason', 'grade', 'give', 'movie', 'little', 'philosophy', 'teach', 'real', 'lessons', 'learn', 'morals', 'story', 'exactly', 'least', 'none', 'are', 'clear', 'reason', 'really', 'kids', 'movie', 'Not', 'pixar', 'movies', 'are', 'been', 'consistent', 'anyway', 'Toy', 'Story', 'series.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'cliches', 'mobs', 'gangsters', 'prison', 'breaks', 'toys', 'certainly', 'odd', 'workable', 'characters', 'most', 'part', 'are', 'predictable', 'are', 'real', 'curve', 'balls', 'story', 'Everything', 'out', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'expect', 'Ken', 'doll', 'film', 'who', 'Barbie', 'doll', 'torn', 'love', 'loyalty', 'gang', 'running', 'joke', 'character', 'being', 'somewhat', 'effeminate', 'almost', 'become', 'tasteless', 'never', 'quite', 'there', 'whole', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'up', 'air', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'particularly', 'funny', 'did', 'find', 'offensive', 'problematic', 'young', 'children.I', 'did', 'feel', 'whole', 'mafia', 'motif', 'only', 'worked', 'marginally', 'well', 'Frankly', 'think', 'including', 'kid', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'much', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'movie', 'anything', 'still', 'fun', 'just', 'felt', 'little', 'uncomfortable', 'whole', 'however', 'movie', 'toy', 'story', 'characters', 'having', 'fun', 'going', 'adventures', 'reasonably', 'well', 'tension', 'where', 'tension', 'needed', 'good', 'humor', 'where', 'good', 'humor', 'needed', 'just', 'entertaining', 'exciting', 'overall.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'major', 'shortcomings', 'speak', 'one', 'thing', 'did', 'notice', 'was', 'where', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'focused', 'developing', 'characters', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Jesse', 'one', 'almost', 'development', 'part', 'go', 'tough', 'times', 'harrowing', 'adventures', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'change.The', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'get', 'most', 'focus', 'villain', 'Lots-o', 'where', 'film', 'story', 'happen', 'comparing', 'villain', 'own', 'development', 'healthier-minded', 'toys', 'What', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'sum', 'up', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'wrapped', 'character', 'development', 'adventure', 'one', 'more', 'character', '-study-', 'wrapped', 'adventure', 'real', 'development', 'speak', 'not', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'included', 'Woody', 'film', 'hard', 'reality', 'owner', 'having', 'grown', 'up', 'no', 'longer', 'needing', 'very', 'same', 'reality', 'Jesse', 'faced', 'last', 'film', 'yet', 'not', 'word', 'shared', 'said', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'film', 'kind', 'opportunity', 'had', 'been', 'taken', 'advantage', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'icing', 'cake']",Toy Story 3

I watched this, disbelieving, and it felt like Pixar Studios had been hijacked or something.I'm completely puzzled by the 4 and 5 stars this is getting.  Are these reviewers the same ones who loved the first two Toy Story movies, Monsters, Inc., Wall-E?  The brilliance, laugh-out-loud hilariousness and charm of those and others?  This, folks, is not in the same class.I think I got one laugh through the whole thing. It was just such a dark story, with too much in the way of ominous themes - hostage-taking, threatened dismemberment, imminent death by fire and the list goes on.  Sure, our heroes have faced threats and dangers before, but it didn't hit the right tone in this one.  It was too ""real"".  There was a feeling of dread that overshadowed everything.Worst of all was the villain.  I've had 30-something years to become de-sensitized to all sorts of horror movies and such, but the bear villain in this (and the sidekick villain babydoll) gave me the CREEPS.  If I had kids, no WAY would I be enthused about them seeing this.  Not just for the themes, violence and creep-factor, but because through-and-through - and even at the very end - this movie is dark and depressing.  I wish I had never watched it.Steer clear of this and see How to Train Your Dragon instead.  Far, FAR superior in all respects.",1,This is Pixar?

1253437,A204UDH31JJ5ZW,B00275EHJG,Logan Stewart,"[1, 1]","I should preface this post by saying that it's been a long time since I've seen Toy Story or Toy Story 2.  I do remember that I enjoyed them both, finding their stories entertaining and their humor satisfying.  Plus, the characters are memorable and iconic.  That said, I had a certain expectation for Toy Story 3, namely that I would laugh and that I would get a good story.  Did the movie achieve these things for me?Toy Story 3 takes place several years after the first two films.  Andy is getting ready to head off to College (not some unnamed university or college, but College).  His childhood toys--Woody, Buzz, the Potatoheads, etc.--have all been left behind and stored in a toy box for years.  As Andy grew up, he stopped playing with them, and now that he's going off to College he no longer needs them.The film opens with a glorious battle between the toys in their play universe.  All the favorites are there.  The action is high.  The fun is great.  But then when real life hits, when we find that the toys are desperate for attention once again, all the fun seems to stop.  By accident, the toys end up at a daycare where things aren't as happy as they seemed.  The kids there are rough and hard on toys, uncaring that they break or are damaged.  The daycare serves as the main plot for the movie, introducing new characters with exciting potential.A lot of stuff happens, things that test friendship, loyalty, and self-importance, and the toys (namely Woody) end up changed.  The conclusion was a sappy, probably unrealistic scene that tried to jerk at tears that I didn't feel like shedding.  Am I heartless?  No.  It succeeded in that it had me thinking about my childhood, waxing nostalgic, but I never had a favorite toy that I cared deeply about, let along a sack full.Don't get me wrong.  Toy Story 3 offers a great adventure story.  There were times when I was unsure how the toys were going to manage.  The plot is fun and original.  But what was missing was the humor.  Long has Pixar been a studio that produces films of exceptional stories and high comedic values.  I laughed once or twice, but nothing like I've done with past Pixar films.  And that is where the film suffers.  If there was more clever humor, more oddball funny situations, I might have enjoyed it better, but sadly there was not.On a plus note, the animation was beautiful.  The junkyard scenes were fantastic.  The characters are seamless and smooth.  Even the human characters are better looking, still maintaining their CG animated characteristics but looking more realistic while not crossing the line into Realism.  And the toys were all well crafted and created.Toy Story 3 let me down.  Perhaps it's because it's been a while since I've seen the last ones.  Perhaps it's because I had my standards too high.  Maybe I'm not the target audience?  Whatever it is, I can only recommend this movie to diehard Pixar fans (I'm a fan, but I don't think diehard is a word I'd use to describe my devotion) or Toy Story fans.  Of course, I couldn't expect Pixar to never mess up, and after a dozen mostly-fantastic films, this one blip isn't going to change my opinion of them.  I'm sure they'll be back with a new, grand story, and when it's there, I'll watch it happily.(Note: I saw the 2d version.  I still don't understand the fascination with 3d cinema, and I hope by not purchasing the 3d tickets I'm sending a small message to somebody that I don't want that technology to stick around.  Sadly, I'd say I'm in for a rude awakening.)",4,Meh...

The toys strike out on their own and end up at a Day Care Center with rough play times and the tough Teddy Bear boss, makes sure they stay.What happens when boys grow up and toys are no longer needed?

The kids were really young in that movie theatre but they barely made a movie and were quiet all the way through.  So was I!  Toy Story 3 was far better than most movies in 2010 and I suspect the best one.  Woody, Buzz and the friends are left in a toy chest now and with Andy going to college, mom is all gung ho in cleaning out his room before he goes.  The toys have to be carted up to the attic or thrown out.  That's it.  Andy puts the toys in a garbage bag and leaves it to go up into the attic but mom thinks they are meant for the junkyard and puts them out for the trash!  The toys manage to get themselves to a daycare center but it turns out to be a living hell.  A stuffed bear named Lots-O rules the roost with cruelty and the toys need to get out before they are broken by unruly young children.  Woody has been chosen to go to college with Andy but tries to save his friends.  Adventure ensues.  What is so impressive is how complex the story is and how well developed the movie is made.  Adult movies are usually more childish these days and contain less complex dialog.  Toy Story 3 doesn't insult children or adults and entertains all.

Andy goes off to college and unlike the girls in most Disney animated films, he actually has a living mother. She's the same age as all of us parents who took our children to the original Toy Story films when they were little. All the Toy Story films have been about the sense of time passing and the inevitable sense of loss that goes along with it. Andy's mom, a single mother, is loosing her son and he's ambivalently moving away from her and his childhood, the childhood personified in his beloved toys, especially Woody. The first Toy Story film started with a shot of a cloud-patterned wallpaper in Andy's bedroom. Toy Story 3 begins film ends with the camera panning up into the sky (interestingly, Up ends the same way). The director mentioned during his commentary that this gives the film a ""storybook"" quality, but it also gives it a dimension of mystery and becomes a commentary on the transitory nature of life. It's this sense that gives these wonderful films their resonance and makes us able to watch them again and again. Director Lee Unkrich and Producer Darla Anderson's commentary was excellent; they really went out of their way to give credit to all the individual animators and the work done by everyone at Pixar on the film.

The story is a great continuation that spoke to my older son as he outgrows his once beloved Woody & Buzz and still fascinates my younger one.This movie centers around Andy, all grown up, going away to college and having to clean out his bedroom.  Should he donate his old toys? Throw them out?  Or keep them in the attic for his children?  Woody, Buzz and a few other toys that have survived over the years try one last time to get Andy to play with them.  Their failure makes them think they are doomed for the trash pile and rather then suffer this horrible fate, they plot to get into the donate box. Woody insists that Andy intends for them to be stored in the attic but the others do not believe him.Their arrival at Sunnyside playschool makes them think they've hit the jackpot but all is not as rosy as it seems.  There is a dark undercurrent here, lead by a strawberry smelling stuffed bear.  This brought cries of horror from my youngest along with lots of questions.  Did that mean the toys we donated were being treated horribly too?  Although it all ends well, this part stuck with my youngest.  I sense trouble the next time I attempt to clean out his closet by donating toys he has outgrown.  Thanks Disney.This movie attempts to cater to all age groups.  The parents will need a tissue as it pulls at the heartstrings.  From start, by showing a home movie of Andy when he was young and flashing to present day at a teenage Andy gets ready for college, to finish as the mom looks around Andy's empty room.  Her child is leaving home.  It speaks to tweens who want to leave childish things behind but still have great affection for childhood toys.  The appeal to young kids is as strong as ever as we follow the adventures of Woody and Buzz.  It did contain another creepy baby to give some nightmares.There were some mature references for a ""G"" rated movie.  Ken being gay was referenced several times and they had him striking sexy poses.  They had Buzz set to Spanish mode where he spoke Spanish for a minute or two.  The scene was funny to me but the subtitles annoyed my youngest as he couldn't keep up.This movie told a great tale of getting older for those kids who grew up with Woody and Buzz.  Both my boys could not stop talking about it afterwards.

Did you ever look at a worn-out teddy bear and wonder what type of life it had?  Did you ever wonder what toys would tell us if they could speak? - Well, neither did I; but this movie will surely have you thinking.For those of you who have seen the prequels to this movie, Andy, our one-time six-year-old human protagonist is now ready for college, and like most kids his age, he is closing one door to open another.  For a college kid, the doors are plentiful. - For old toys, it's more limited, as it's simply a matter of closing the bedroom door to open the attic door - if the toys are lucky.Well Andy's beloved toys end up being luckier than most, as they managed to escape garage sales, garbage cans, and even the confined safety of an attic retirement village.  - But not before they have another adventure of a lifetime.  It's one that includes a psychopathic but sad teddy bear, his accomplice baby doll, a neurotic monkey, a knowledgeable telephone, a threatening incinerator, and enough Ken outfits to have made even Elton John jealous during his heyday - not to mention Barbie.Andy matures, and so do his toys, as they not only have a bond with Andy, but to themselves, their new acquaintances, and the imagination of a new owner.  Towards the end of movie, we see Andy letting go of his toys - and his childhood.  But he and his toys fulfill their commitment to each other as both the human and his imaginary counterparts have a lot more living to do and love to offer - in their separate yet not-so-separate worlds.This movie brings a lot of laughter, but also some tears, in spite of a happy ending.  Mothers sending their children off to college for the first time will end up bawling.  I know I did, even though I wasn't in their situation.  On the bright side, these parents will have less cleaning up to do after their children leave, because after seeing this movie, the college kiddies won't trust anyone else to pack up their cherished belongings.Now, did you ever wonder if Ken was gay?

I hope there's no more movies after this, because while this movie was good, the ending was bittersweet and somewhat dissatisfying and there were a couple of rather dark moments (the previous two movies would be appropriate for little kids, but this one is definitely for kids who are a bit older, or for those of us old enough to have seen Toy Story 1 when it first premiered over ten years ago.There were a lot of great characters, lines, and action sequences. There's a lot of funny stuff going on - Andy's imaginative opening scene where the toys were portrayed in a real Wild West atmosphere, various day care scenes, and the escape scene, along with Barbie and Ken getting together.This movie would have been five stars if not for the message conveyed at the ending. Yes, I'm all for donating unwanted toys or passing them down to a younger generation, but I still have a couple of toys from my childhood though most have been given away to younger cousins or donated. For Andy to do what he did to Woody somehow cheapened the times he shared with Woody.  Sure, Woody would probably be lonely at college, but the message conveyed by the ending of the film is that we have to like, give it all away. Sometimes having something from one's childhood - or young adulthood - is a comfort and a treasure for people who have gotten older and passed various phases in life.If the ending had been less bittersweet, then I would give 5 stars.

In this one, Andy has grown up and is preparing for college. The toys are worried that they will be thrown away as Andy is no longer interested in them. Only Woody is sure that Andy would never do that. In fact Andy packs Woody to take to college with him and sets the other toys aside to put in the attic.Andy's mother accidentally thinks the toys are meant for the garbage and puts them out. Only some last minute action by Woody and TRex save the toys from being garbage fodder (this is an omen of a larger danger later in the film).Andy's mother than thinks the toys were meant to be donated and she then takes them to a day care center. The toys at first thinks they have arrived in Heaven because they meet a whole bunch of new toys led by a big pink teddy bear who tells them they will be played with all day.Unfortunately, things are not as good as they seem as the daycare starts looking like a prison and dangers abound. There are a lot of touching moments in this film and don't be surprised to shed a tear or two.I really enjoyed this film as much as the other two. The authors have made another fun and original story and all the toys still have the same voices, except Slinky Dog whose orignal actor passed away. On the DVD extras, the new voice of slinky dog is the original actor's friend and he tells how he imitated the original actor's voice. Also, on the extras we get to meet the voice of Andy who is the same actor (now in his 20's) who needed to be tracked down and luckily was delighted to do the voice again. Ned Beatty is the pink teddy bear, Michael Keaton plays a ""sleazy"" Ken doll and Whoopie Goldberg even has a character.",5,The Perfect Ending to the Best Animated Trilogy Ever!,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",2011,1747,"['watching', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'Toys', 'are', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'characters', 'ever', 'one', 'Andy', 'grown', 'up', 'preparing', 'college', 'toys', 'are', 'worried', 'will', 'be', 'thrown', 'away', 'Andy', 'no', 'longer', 'interested', 'Only', 'Woody', 'sure', 'Andy', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'fact', 'Andy', 'Woody', 'take', 'college', 'other', 'toys', 'aside', 'put', 'attic.Andy', 'mother', 'accidentally', 'toys', 'are', 'meant', 'garbage', 'puts', 'out', 'Only', 'last', 'minute', 'action', 'Woody', 'TRex', 'save', 'toys', 'being', 'garbage', 'fodder', 'omen', 'larger', 'danger', 'later', 'film', '.Andy', 'mother', 'toys', 'were', 'meant', 'be', 'donated', 'then', 'day', 'care', 'center', 'toys', 'first', 'thinks', 'have', 'arrived', 'Heaven', 'meet', 'whole', 'bunch', 'new', 'toys', 'led', 'big', 'pink', 'teddy', 'bear', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'played', 'day.Unfortunately', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'seem', 'daycare', 'looking', 'prison', 'dangers', 'abound', 'are', 'lot', 'touching', 'moments', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'shed', 'tear', 'two.I', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'other', 'two', 'authors', 'have', 'made', 'fun', 'original', 'story', 'toys', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'voices', 'Slinky', 'Dog', 'orignal', 'actor', 'passed', 'away', 'DVD', 'extras', 'new', 'voice', 'slinky', 'dog', 'original', 'actor', 'friend', 'how', 'imitated', 'original', 'actor', 'voice', 'Also', 'extras', 'get', 'meet', 'voice', 'Andy', 'who', 'same', 'actor', 'now', '20', 'who', 'needed', 'be', 'tracked', 'down', 'luckily', 'was', 'delighted', 'do', 'voice', 'again', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'pink', 'teddy', 'bear', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'sleazy', 'Ken', 'doll', 'Whoopie', 'Goldberg', 'even', 'character']",Toy Story 3

We reluctantly let him watch Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  It's interesting when you watch a G-rated movie before you have kids and compare it to your experience after you have kids.  The Toy Story series has a lot of things toddlers are taught not to do - calling each other idiots, punching each other in the face, and otherwise using ""not nice words"" that is an integral part of any comedy act. It's funny, but it ain't for kids.That's the brilliance of the Toy Story series.  It's about childish things but not about children.  The first Toy Story movie was as much about being a parent as it was about being a toy.  In Toy Story the parent (Woody) was replaced by the boy's new stepdad (Buzz).  Woody, old-fashioned and stubborn, had to blend the new and old families in a way that respected everyone involved.  And they did, unified by the love of their ""son"" Andy.Toy Story 2 was about putting the parent's needs above the child.  An injury reminded Woody of his mortality. He had an opportunity to forge his own path, independent of Andy.  Instead he chose to stay with the boy, forgoing fame for the love of his child.Toy Story 3 reaches the logical outcome that loomed in Toy Story 2.  Andy grew up. He's moving on to college and his ""parents"" are left behind. What's to become of them? Will they be stored away in some old attic, forgotten?  Or will they find a new life in retirement?Toy Story 3 is all about family.  What's more important is that they stick together, a point repeated by Buzz and Woody. They may lose their child, but at least they have each other.Toy Story 3 is also a prison caper, complete with seemingly pleasant wardens, a prison gang, and escape attempts. And yet Toy Story 3 is far more entertaining than most live action prison escape movies. Packed with action, filled with poignant moments, and featuring all the characters we've come to know over a decade, Toy Story 3 is a love note to the toys - and people - we've left behind.  More Escape from Preschoolcatraz than a comedy, Toy Story 3 is an adult take on an adult problem.

Yeah, it's really been a lackluster year.The animation and voice acting are top notch as always, but Pixar never fails in the most important part of a movie, the script. Sure a movie can look pretty and all, but it's the writing that has always elevated Pixar above other animation studios. How to Train Your Dragon was a very good effort from Dreamworks this year, but watching Toy Story 3 today just confirmed how far they still have to go.I will agree with the claim that most critics are making by saying that this is one of the best movie trilogies of all time. Other than the first three films of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Lord of the Rings, I can't think of any others more consistently great. Toy Story 3 is just as good as 1 and 2, but it goes into some darker territory than the previous two, so much so, I would say this is geared more for adults than kids. Don't let that fool you, there are more than enough clever lines and visual gags to keep you laughting, as well as, some great action sequences. I loved the whole prison break out of the daycare part, and the last five minutes or so couldn't have been any more perfect, leaving you wiping away happy and sad tears at the same time.In the end, we are left with a beautifully wrapped up conclusion to a series of movies that will be treasured for infinity and beyond.I didn't see the movie in 3-D since I heard it wasn't worth the extra money. Judging from the trailers I saw before the movie started, everyone is rushing to tack on 3-D at the last minute.

I usually wait for the DVD since I don't have a Blu-ray player and have no need for two versions of the same movie. Sadly, Disney no longer releases two disc versions on DVD only and the single disc DVDs seem to be very bare bones (like Wreck It Ralph).  This was a pleasant surprise.The disc itself has artwork on it, unlike the more recent releases that have a plain gray disc with the title stamped on it. This has a nice colorful feel to it. It also has a decent amount of special features, including some behind the scenes interviews with the cast and crew.  I still wish I could buy a two disc DVD version like I did with Toy Story 1 and 2, which had LOADS of extras, but I'll settle for this one. I'm satisfied with this.  If you're a Pixar or Toy Story lover who likes special features but doesn't need an entire disc of them, then this is the right choice.

KNOW IT ALL  ;-b ""DR SHOCK""","[5, 7]","I know that title will stir up some controversy, but I can not think of a more consistent trilogy that has gotten better with each installment with the third film being the best of all! Pixar has done it again and is really starting to show up the competition with their latest classic animated tale Toy Story 3. What a track record!, Have these guys ever bombed? .....OK Andrew let's just leave Cars out of this! ;-D ....it's not that bad, just not as good as their greatest works.Pixar's Toy Story 3 is really a beautiful film to behold, both visually and metaphorically. I've shed more tears watching their animated films than most live action films combined in recent years. I guess the original Toy Story being somewhat crude by today's animation standards only had one way to go, up! That doesn't mean it was an easy task, but it is the one that started it all and put Pixar on the map. To improve on the original in the sequels, things like expectations and topping what they did last time have to be carefully balanced and of course the story must include a believable growth of the characters.It is all these areas that Toy Story 3 succeeds with flying colors! It's an incredible film that is both funny and heartfelt. One of the great things about this series is the nostalgic aspect, remembering all those cool toys and the in jokes that only adults will get. I do think this film is rather intense for younger kids at times, but most of the great one are. These films are really made with adults in mind which in nothing new to animation. Disney classic and Bugs Bunny cartoons where always constructed for adults as most kids wouldn't get half the jokes in them anyway.This is something for parents to consider before they let their kids see this or any other film like it. I know I grew up watching Pinocchio and Bambi and I never felt traumatized by them and they are some of the most frightening animated films out there....the same could be said about Finding Nemo which has some very scary scenes in it.Since parents tend to shield children from this stuff nowadays, well........ the choice it yours, but I don't think shielding them from this stuff is protecting them....that doesn't mean any of this stuff is meant for 3 year olds. The same case can be made for PC versions of these and other cartoons. I think having open discussions with children rather than hiding life's negatives is a much better solution.The four disc edition is loaded with interesting goodies and of course the film is included  in formats Blu Ray, DVD and Digital copy, which all look exceptional.",5,THE END?..TO QUITE POSSIBLY THE GREATEST TRILOGY OF ALL TIME!,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",2010,2593,"['know', 'title', 'will', 'stir', 'up', 'controversy', 'can', 'not', 'think', 'more', 'consistent', 'trilogy', 'gotten', 'better', 'installment', 'third', 'film', 'being', 'best', 'Pixar', 'done', 'again', 'really', 'starting', 'show', 'up', 'competition', 'latest', 'classic', 'animated', 'tale', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'What', 'track', 'record', 'Have', 'guys', 'ever', 'bombed', 'Andrew', 'let', 'just', 'leave', 'Cars', '.it', 'not', 'bad', 'just', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'greatest', 'works.Pixar', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'really', 'beautiful', 'film', 'behold', 'visually', 'metaphorically', ""'ve"", 'shed', 'more', 'tears', 'watching', 'animated', 'films', 'most', 'live', 'action', 'films', 'combined', 'recent', 'years', 'guess', 'original', 'Toy', 'Story', 'being', 'somewhat', 'crude', 'today', 'animation', 'standards', 'only', 'had', 'one', 'way', 'go', 'up', ""n't"", 'mean', 'was', 'easy', 'task', 'one', 'started', 'put', 'Pixar', 'map', 'improve', 'original', 'sequels', 'things', 'expectations', 'topping', 'what', 'did', 'last', 'time', 'have', 'be', 'carefully', 'balanced', 'course', 'story', 'must', 'include', 'believable', 'growth', 'characters.It', 'areas', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'flying', 'colors', 'incredible', 'film', 'funny', 'heartfelt', 'One', 'great', 'things', 'series', 'nostalgic', 'aspect', 'remembering', 'cool', 'toys', 'jokes', 'only', 'adults', 'will', 'get', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'rather', 'intense', 'younger', 'kids', 'times', 'most', 'great', 'one', 'are', 'films', 'are', 'really', 'made', 'adults', 'mind', 'nothing', 'new', 'animation', 'Disney', 'classic', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'cartoons', 'where', 'always', 'constructed', 'adults', 'most', 'kids', 'would', ""n't"", 'get', 'jokes', 'anyway.This', 'something', 'parents', 'consider', 'let', 'kids', 'see', 'other', 'film', 'know', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Pinocchio', 'Bambi', 'never', 'felt', 'traumatized', 'are', 'most', 'frightening', 'animated', 'films', 'there', '.the', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Finding', 'Nemo', 'very', 'scary', 'scenes', 'it.Since', 'parents', 'tend', 'shield', 'children', 'stuff', 'well', 'choice', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'shielding', 'stuff', 'protecting', '.that', ""n't"", 'mean', 'stuff', 'meant', '3', 'year', 'olds', 'same', 'case', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'PC', 'versions', 'other', 'cartoons', 'think', 'having', 'open', 'discussions', 'children', 'rather', 'hiding', 'life', 'negatives', 'much', 'better', 'solution.The', 'four', 'disc', 'edition', 'loaded', 'interesting', 'goodies', 'course', 'film', 'included', 'formats', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'DVD', 'Digital', 'copy', 'look', 'exceptional']",Toy Story 3

My youngest son, especially, was begging to go, but while I was impressed by the first two, a long ways back, and saw them as showcases for the increasingly sophisticated animation techniques at Pixar, I didn't really love either one of them as much asA Bug's LifeorThe IncrediblesorWall-EorRatatouille.  Perhaps it's just the devoted toy concept that didn't quite move me.  I'm not quite sure why, but for whatever reason, I went into this unenthusiastic and only doing it for the kids.As it turns out, I really liked it.  As far as I'm concerned right now it's the best of the series - of course, now I'd actually be willing to go back and sit through the others and maybe find I liked them too.  It's clever and inventive, with sight gags and visual puns that are underplayed, almost in passing. Its big, blockbuster animation, but the humor manages to be subtle, rather than in your face like so much popular animation these days.  While, like the other films and like everything Pixar, it's not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve it's never sappy, and the storytelling earns its sentimental payoff rather than wrenching it from you.  I never felt manipulated.  The look is nothing short of astonishing.  The visuals are intricate and full of rich details, but it never feels busy or crowded.  I'd like to see it again just so now I can pay more attention to the details now I know what's happening.  The opening reminded me a bit of the surreal and (even more) hilarious stop motion toy fantasyA Town Called Panic(also highly recommended), but the rest fit nicely into the general pattern of the series without feeling like one of the generic and uninspiring sequels that are so common these days.The basic story should be familiar: Woody and Buzz and their buddies are facing a new abandonment crisis.  This time, it's because Andy is going to college, and they fear he will leave them behind in storage, or worse, throw them away.  What is surprising is how fresh they manage to make it all feel.  Nothing was predictable or generic, and I was sad to see it end.  Perhaps best of all, though, was the amazing short film ""Night and Day"" with which it began.  It's better not to say anything about that, since it's best just to see it unawares.  Still it's a magical film, one of the most exciting and intriguing animated shorts I'd ever seen.

Doyle ""film buff""","[0, 0]","If ever there was a film that exceeds all expectations it's Pixar's TOY STORY 3, a movie with the familiar cast headed by TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively, featuring the further adventures of the toy gang everyone fell in love with after the first smash hit.The toys are accidentally abandoned when Andy's mom is helping him pack for college. They end up dumped unceremoniously at a daycare center for kids whom the toys think will appreciate and play with them just as Andy did--with tender, loving care.As they discover on their first day in the playroom, these kids are a nightmare with toys. Woody resolves to return to his owner's attic while the others stay behind until they must plan their great escape. What happens next is unpredictable from start to finish, the only certainty being that there will be a happy ending--which gives the story a final tug on the heartstrings with a poignant and tender conclusion.This is animation that is beyond clever, as imaginative as a film of this kind can get, masterfully staged and brilliantly animated. It's also a bit scary at times since all of the characters almost meet their final destiny a number of times, long before the story is over, thanks to a villainous plush toy bear called Lotso, wonderfully voiced by Ned Beatty, hug-gable on the surface but a scoundrel at the core.Since all the technical stuff is beyond reproach, there's no reason why TOY STORY 3 shouldn't please fans of the first two in this series.

The story is brilliantly continued from where it left off, and runs the gamut of emotions more thoroughly and effectively than either of the first two movies did... and it had to, to be considered a worthy finale. I saw somebody else comment that this movie would be too scary for children under six years old. My youngest is five and she didn't find it too scary at all - her comment was she ""liked"" the incinerator scene because they all got out fine, and I would think most four or five year olds would view it in the same why without any issues. Now if you're talking about 2-3 year olds, they might have a more difficult time with it, but also just keeping their attention in general throughout the film could be problematic. It is a more sophisticated, in essence ""grown up"" Toy Story that we're talking about here, but in my experience everybody in my family absolutely loved it, ranging in ages from 5 to 50. The Blu-ray combo pack is definitely a worthy purchase for the movie itself, and the extras included make it that much more worthwhile.I truly hope this is where Disney leaves the Toy Story movie franchise.

1253499,A2T6MYD9VVPMEU,B00275EHJG,Persian Poetess,"[1, 1]","The Toy Story series is almost like a time capsule of my childhood.  I grew up with the lovable gang of toys and never really felt ""too old"" when treating myself to a viewing of their latest adventures.  Much of the growing up that Andy experiences throughout the trilogy rang so strongly with how I felt as I was approaching adulthood.  The latest iteration of the series is the true crescendo of when a child finally passes on what was once his world in exchange for a new one.  In a sense, this is what the toys experience as well.  Below I will describe my overall impressions of this fantastic PIXAR creation as well as my thoughts on the great blu-ray set...THE MOVIE:While the trailers may give you the impression that this is a rehash of the old storyline where the toys end up trekking far away from home to rescue one of their comrades, it is far from this.  The goal this time is not to return to Andy's but to do whatever it takes to stay together.  You really come to care for the toys as a family and are invested in their fates.Though some were skeptical at the introduction of new players to the rowdy band of misfits, the new talent was marvelous and really meshed well with the regulars.  Keaton's Ken for example is one of the most hilarious toys to date.  His puppy dog love affair with Barbie and passion for fashion steals many of the films funny scenes.  Other honorable mentions go to Dalton's overcommitted thespian Mr. Pricklepants, Pena's ""muy caliente"" Spanish Buzz (I would Paso Doble with him anytime), and Beatty's drawling and deceiving Lotso.What really is the cherry on top of this PIXAR masterpiece is the larger than life world they create through the eyes of a toy.  PIXAR have always been great visual artisans and it really shows in this final chapter of the Toy Story saga.  The universe of the toys may have familiar elements of our own but still manages to be one we have never seen before.  Its scope is so huge, that it causes you to feel as tiny as a toy when trying to drink it all in.THE BLU-RAY SET:The blu-ray disc rivals any 3D that was offered by the theaters.  The quality is amazingly crystal clear and is neither muddy or grainy.  You will definitely notice that the colors pop more than the typical DVD version making it even more visually delightful.  The audio track is also nicely mixed and I appreciate that the voices of the characters are not drowned out by loud sound effects or booming music.The set itself is bursting with a bunch of extra material that makes it worthy of purchase.  Lots of the content is filled with video of the stars reading off their lines or the animators plugging away at models on their computers.  Lee Unkrich walks you through alot of the reasons behind certain scenes that were important to the story.  Unkrich's bonus material is especially fun to watch as you can tell the guy almost seems like a big kid himself.  The promotional extras are mainly a compilation of the YouTube and TV promos that were created leading up to the release of the movie.  Ken's dating tips is one of them that I recommend you definitely check out.In conclusion, the Toy Story 3 Blu-ray set is a must own regardless of whether you have seen the movie or not.  There's no need to waste money on a rental as the wizards of PIXAR have done the trilogy justice.  Let me put it this way, buying this movie is on-par with scoring a ticket to Disneyland - its always a joy to visit.",5,The Toys are a Joy!,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",2010,3447,"['Toy', 'Story', 'series', 'almost', 'time', 'capsule', 'childhood', 'grew', 'up', 'lovable', 'gang', 'toys', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'too', 'old', 'when', 'treating', 'viewing', 'latest', 'adventures', 'Much', 'growing', 'up', 'Andy', 'experiences', 'trilogy', 'rang', 'so', 'strongly', 'how', 'felt', 'was', 'approaching', 'adulthood', 'latest', 'iteration', 'series', 'true', 'crescendo', 'when', 'child', 'finally', 'was', 'once', 'world', 'exchange', 'new', 'one', 'sense', 'what', 'toys', 'experience', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'describe', 'overall', 'impressions', 'fantastic', 'PIXAR', 'creation', 'as', 'well', 'thoughts', 'great', 'blu-ray', 'set', 'MOVIE', 'trailers', 'may', 'give', 'impression', 'rehash', 'old', 'storyline', 'where', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'trekking', 'far', 'away', 'home', 'rescue', 'one', 'comrades', 'far', 'goal', 'time', 'not', 'return', 'Andy', 'do', 'whatever', 'stay', 'together', 'really', 'come', 'care', 'toys', 'family', 'are', 'invested', 'fates.Though', 'were', 'skeptical', 'introduction', 'new', 'players', 'rowdy', 'band', 'misfits', 'new', 'talent', 'was', 'marvelous', 'really', 'meshed', 'well', 'regulars', 'Keaton', 'Ken', 'example', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'toys', 'date', 'puppy', 'dog', 'love', 'affair', 'Barbie', 'passion', 'fashion', 'steals', 'many', 'films', 'funny', 'scenes', 'Other', 'honorable', 'mentions', 'go', 'Dalton', 'overcommitted', 'thespian', 'Mr.', 'Pricklepants', 'Pena', 'muy', 'caliente', 'Spanish', 'Buzz', 'would', 'Paso', 'Doble', 'anytime', 'Beatty', 'drawling', 'deceiving', 'Lotso.What', 'really', 'cherry', 'top', 'PIXAR', 'masterpiece', 'larger', 'life', 'world', 'create', 'eyes', 'toy', 'PIXAR', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'visual', 'artisans', 'really', 'final', 'chapter', 'Toy', 'Story', 'saga', 'universe', 'toys', 'may', 'have', 'familiar', 'elements', 'own', 'still', 'be', 'one', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'scope', 'so', 'huge', 'feel', 'as', 'tiny', 'toy', 'when', 'trying', 'drink', 'in.THE', 'BLU-RAY', 'SET', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'rivals', '3D', 'was', 'offered', 'theaters', 'quality', 'amazingly', 'crystal', 'clear', 'muddy', 'grainy', 'will', 'definitely', 'notice', 'colors', 'pop', 'more', 'typical', 'DVD', 'version', 'making', 'even', 'more', 'visually', 'delightful', 'audio', 'track', 'also', 'nicely', 'mixed', 'appreciate', 'voices', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'drowned', 'out', 'loud', 'sound', 'effects', 'booming', 'music.The', 'set', 'bursting', 'bunch', 'extra', 'material', 'worthy', 'purchase', 'Lots', 'content', 'filled', 'video', 'stars', 'reading', 'off', 'lines', 'animators', 'plugging', 'away', 'models', 'computers', 'Lee', 'Unkrich', 'walks', 'alot', 'reasons', 'certain', 'scenes', 'were', 'important', 'story', 'Unkrich', 'bonus', 'material', 'especially', 'fun', 'watch', 'can', 'tell', 'guy', 'almost', 'big', 'kid', 'promotional', 'extras', 'are', 'mainly', 'compilation', 'YouTube', 'TV', 'promos', 'were', 'created', 'leading', 'up', 'release', 'movie', 'Ken', 'dating', 'tips', 'one', 'recommend', 'definitely', 'check', 'out.In', 'conclusion', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Blu-ray', 'set', 'must', 'own', 'regardless', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'not', 'need', 'waste', 'money', 'rental', 'wizards', 'PIXAR', 'have', 'done', 'trilogy', 'justice', 'Let', 'put', 'way', 'buying', 'movie', 'on-par', 'scoring', 'ticket', 'Disneyland', 'always', 'joy', 'visit']",Toy Story 3

It's probably safe to say that anyone who had seen the previous two movies would be eager to see this one. I didn't like Up, so I was ready for a good Pixar movie again. And I didn't get it.In this final installment, Andy (still voiced by John Morris), who is leaving for college, has decided he needs to move his old junk (toys) to the attic for good. Except for Woody, who he's going to take to college with him. Which is pretty weird, seriously, who really cares about their old toys at this point? It never matters how much you loved them when you were a kid, you stop caring. This whole Andy-needs-Woody thing seems like it's just a plot device.Do to the carelessness of Andy's mom, the toys end up at Sunnyside day-care, where they are misused by little kids who don't understand how to use them. But wait, shouldn't they, being toys and all, be accustomed to this, or at least, expect it?Anyway, it's up to sheriff Woody to rescue his friends, break out of Sunnyside, and get back to their beloved Andy. But it's unclear what Andy feels towards these toys. At the beginning, he doesn't want them. Midway through, Mrs. Potato Head's separated eye shows us a soundless vision of Andy apparently in distress because the toys are gone. At the end of the film, it again looks like he doesn't want them.These characters are not what they used to be. They have become interchangeable or useless. The only one who really seems to matter at all is Woody. A lot of what they get to do involves being imprisoned or smacked around. The break out should have been true to who they are and dynamic, but it was ho-hum. Slinky dog barely did anything. I kept forgetting Bullseye was there. Hamm and Mr. Potato Head's friendship was missing. Where was the loving bond between the potato heads and their squeaky alien foster children? Especially a problem was Buzz Lightyear. His reset switch gets pressed and he becomes a sir-yes-sir antagonist. Just when you think everything is going to go back to normal, he gets reset again and becomes Spanish before finally resetting to his original state much later. Why did all of this have to happen? I guess it's supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. Buzz is supposed to be a leader, second in command, ya know? And yet throughout Toy Story 3 he is nothing but a throwaway.I didn't find ""3"" to be very funny at all. And I'm not just comparing it to ""2""', I mean it genuinely was not funny. I've seen the movie twice now, once with my younger brother, and neither of us laughed.Toy Story 3 suffers in comparison to the second movie, the second being the best in the trilogy. Toy Story number one was flawed in that Woody was overly mean and intent on revenge, and the deus ex machina climax completely defeated the point of the movie's theme. Toy Story 2 saw much improvement, with vigorous use of its characters, energetic journeying and adventure, the use of ""You've Got a Friend In Me"", Jesse's back-story, and Stinky Pete's ominous cynicism. I would have hoped that ""3"" could take of from there and deliver and incredible experience, but that did not happen.Toy Story 3 ends the trilogy with a weak plot and an excessively depressing mood. You will see nothing here like Jesse's ""When Somebody Loved Me"" montage or the expert storytelling, atmosphere and characterization of previous films. This is just an empty tale of a toy obsessed with its owner, nothing else, and that really is a shame.",2,"No, I didn't cry.",1285977600,"10 2, 2010",2010,3468,"['Well', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'probably', 'safe', 'say', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'previous', 'two', 'movies', 'would', 'be', 'eager', 'see', 'one', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Up', 'was', 'ready', 'good', 'Pixar', 'movie', 'again', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'it.In', 'final', 'installment', 'Andy', 'still', 'voiced', 'John', 'Morris', 'who', 'leaving', 'college', 'decided', 'move', 'old', 'junk', 'attic', 'good', 'Woody', 'who', 'going', 'take', 'college', 'Which', 'pretty', 'weird', 'seriously', 'who', 'really', 'old', 'toys', 'point', 'never', 'how', 'much', 'loved', 'when', 'were', 'kid', 'stop', 'caring', 'whole', 'Andy-needs-Woody', 'thing', 'just', 'plot', 'device.Do', 'carelessness', 'Andy', 'mom', 'toys', 'end', 'up', 'Sunnyside', 'day-care', 'where', 'are', 'misused', 'little', 'kids', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'use', 'wait', 'should', ""n't"", 'being', 'toys', 'be', 'accustomed', 'least', 'expect', 'Anyway', 'up', 'sheriff', 'Woody', 'rescue', 'friends', 'break', 'Sunnyside', 'get', 'back', 'beloved', 'Andy', 'unclear', 'what', 'Andy', 'toys', 'beginning', ""n't"", 'want', 'Midway', 'Mrs', 'Potato', 'Head', 'separated', 'eye', 'soundless', 'vision', 'Andy', 'apparently', 'distress', 'toys', 'are', 'gone', 'end', 'film', 'again', ""n't"", 'want', 'them.These', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'what', 'used', 'be', 'have', 'become', 'interchangeable', 'useless', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'matter', 'Woody', 'lot', 'what', 'get', 'do', 'involves', 'being', 'imprisoned', 'smacked', 'break', 'out', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'who', 'are', 'dynamic', 'was', 'ho-hum', 'Slinky', 'dog', 'barely', 'did', 'anything', 'kept', 'forgetting', 'Bullseye', 'was', 'there', 'Hamm', 'Mr', 'Potato', 'Head', 'friendship', 'was', 'missing', 'Where', 'was', 'loving', 'bond', 'potato', 'heads', 'squeaky', 'alien', 'foster', 'children', 'Especially', 'problem', 'was', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'reset', 'switch', 'pressed', 'sir-yes-sir', 'antagonist', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'everything', 'going', 'go', 'back', 'normal', 'reset', 'again', 'Spanish', 'finally', 'resetting', 'original', 'state', 'much', 'later', 'Why', 'did', 'have', 'happen', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'Buzz', 'supposed', 'be', 'leader', 'second', 'command', 'ya', 'know', 'yet', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'nothing', 'throwaway.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', '3', 'be', 'very', 'funny', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'comparing', '2', 'mean', 'genuinely', 'was', 'not', 'funny', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'twice', 'now', 'once', 'younger', 'brother', 'laughed.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'suffers', 'comparison', 'second', 'movie', 'second', 'being', 'best', 'trilogy', 'Toy', 'Story', 'number', 'one', 'was', 'flawed', 'Woody', 'was', 'overly', 'mean', 'intent', 'revenge', 'deus', 'ex', 'machina', 'climax', 'completely', 'defeated', 'point', 'movie', 'theme', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'saw', 'much', 'improvement', 'vigorous', 'use', 'characters', 'energetic', 'journeying', 'adventure', 'use', ""'ve"", 'Got', 'Friend', 'Me', 'Jesse', 'back-story', 'Stinky', 'Pete', 'ominous', 'cynicism', 'would', 'have', 'hoped', '3', 'could', 'take', 'deliver', 'incredible', 'experience', 'did', 'not', 'happen.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'trilogy', 'weak', 'plot', 'excessively', 'depressing', 'mood', 'will', 'see', 'nothing', 'here', 'Jesse', 'When', 'Somebody', 'Loved', 'Me', 'montage', 'expert', 'storytelling', 'atmosphere', 'characterization', 'previous', 'films', 'just', 'empty', 'tale', 'toy', 'obsessed', 'owner', 'nothing', 'else', 'really', 'shame']",Toy Story 3

As fans have waited eleven years for the next sequel, the sequel itself has noted the passage of time...Andy is now a young man & ready to go off to college. His toys--whom he has outgrown--are despondent that Andy no longer plays with them. So it's up to the attic as storage for the toys; except a terrible mistake sends the gang to a pre-school called Sunnyside. Thinking the place is a new life for them, they soon learn they've been duped: The place is a prison, a living nightmare as they are caged at night & put at the mercy of ruthless toddlers during the day. This is where the storyline becomes surprisingly dark as Woody returns to rescue his friends & hatch sort of a ""Mission Impossible"": Get everyone past security, ""all-seeing monkeys"", and all kinds of obstacles so they can be reunited with their owner.Disney-Pixar just never ceases to amaze me. The first two films were oh-so-imaginative & clever--with the trademark Disney ""heart""--but this one pulls out all the stops. It's full of thrilling, almost suspenseful twists & turns, humor & powerfully emotional moments. And what can I say about the animation that hasn't been said? It's simply wonderful. The voice talent, as usual, is superb. Veteran actor Ned Beatty turns in a good performance as Lotso, the bear that's cuddly & sweet-smelling on the outside, but hides a dark heart of cruel villainy inside. Michael Keaton also has some wonderfully hammy moments as Ken.There's the usual satiric toy humor here, but what will probably get to you are the heart-wrenching moments. Namely, when the gang finds themselves hopelessly staring death in the face, and touchingly holding hands as the end draws near; and the finale, as Andy donates his toys to a sweet little girl down the street, allowing himself one last play with his ""old pals"" before heading to college.

He bundles his fav toys for the attic, for his memories or for children (when he has them). They get sent by mistake to Sunnyside daycare center. Instead of loving care they are given to the youngest, most out of control preschoolers with violence and anger management issues. Woody and Buzz Lightyear, et al, are used to hammer in pegs, for the kids to bite, spill food on.At night, when adults and brats are away, the daycare center is run like a prison by sadistic toy Lotso, the Strawberry Bear with the help of a vaccuous fashion plate Ken (Ken and Barbie). Them the plot turns into the 1950's Classic Cool Hand Luke, with The Bear playing the part of The Captain (made famous by Strother Martin) and Woody playing Cool Hand Luke (the Paul Newman part) and Ken as a ""Boss"". Strawberry Bear doesn't say ""What we have here is failure to communicate"" but he does everything but, he has the same cane and the same accent, same attitude. He puts Mr. Potatohead in ""the box"" for punishment, (those aren't cigars in the sand!) Buzz Lightyear gets rebooted to ""Boss"" and romantic Latin Lover modes. Kids won't get any of these insider jokes, it will all fly over their heads, but I defy an adult to watch this movie without being near tears in places. I won't give away anymore plot, but just say its quite bittersweet to all who remember their childhood toys and earlier days and going to college. The ending is not as dark as Cool Hand Luke - it IS a kids movie!For those readers unfamiliar with Cool Hand, I recommend you see this movie and then rent the classic at the video store. An AFI Top 100 Movies of All Time.This could be the best Toy Story of the series, it certainly has the most detailed and emotional plot.The Next Big Thing seems to be 3D and there are more 3D movies than you can shake a stick at.

As said before, all Pixar movies were masterpieces (exception to the movie ""Cars"" which was the only pixar movie that was mediocre) and Toy Story 3 is no different.Toy Story 3 begins with Andy in his bedroom about to leave college thinking about where to put his beloved toys he had for years. The future of Woody, Buzz and everyone else is in jepordy when Andy doesn't know whether to put the toys in the attic or to give them away. The toys decide to donate themeselves to a Day Care in which they can be played with for many more years to come, however it doesn't go exactly how they imagined it would be. The story of Toy Story 3 is incredibly told, through all the usual humor and acting that the previous 2 movies were famous for. This movie although very funny, is much darker then its predecessors thanks to the main antagonist Lotso who makes the Toys life a living hell. The back story of Lotso the bear is actually very believable to the point where you can sort of feel his pain and sense of abandonment from his original owner. While the story is awsome, the graphics of this movie are visually impressive. You can tell right away how much the technology has improved since the previous Toy Stories were made. The texture and feel of the movie is down right scary real and you can only imgaine how it would look on Blu-Ray.This movie is now my new favorite pixar movie of all time and it is possibly one of the greatest animated films ever made. It is a fitting end to the Toy Story trilogy and the endinf could even make the most masculine of men break down to tears. The feeling of nostalgia  when watching this movie is incredible for the people (such as myself) who have grown up watching Toy Story. I highly recommend this film to people of all ages and even if you haven't watched the previous Toy Story movies, you can still enjoy this movie as much as the people who are familiar with the characters.

OK, you may eviscerate me now!!Being a fan of Toy Story 1 and 2 when I was a kid, I knew I was in for a serious ride when I went to the 4 PM IMAX screening on opening day. As I walked into the the theater, I had to tell myself that this is it, this is the last Toy Story movie ever, that I will never see another Toy Story movie again. So as the movie began playing, I prepared myself to say goodbye to my favorite walking talking toys.This movie is simply a gem. I had anticipated it all the way back when I saw the trailer with Up. The whole theatre went ""Oh COME ON!!!!"" when they found out they had to wait a year to see it.Toy Story shows that Andy has grown up now, is going to college. The toys have been donated to a local daycare, which may seem like a happy place to all the other toys, but Woody can't shake the fact that the person he grew up with, Andy, is away from him now. Sunnyside Daycare has rowdy kids though, who do nothing but destroy the toys. Even worse, Lotso Huggin Bear, Ken, all the others seem nice, but are evil and cruel bastards. Furthermore, Buzz has been reprogrammed to be on Lotso's side. Oh no! The toys must reprogram him, and furthermore, get the HELL out of Sunnyside!!!The film is, in a word, spectacular. I was expecting it to suck, but surprise surprise!!! I loved this film. Great voice acting, great direction, animation is spectacular, and the best thing of the film? The darkness. One incredible scene is where the toys face death as they find themselves in the furnace near the end of the film. That scene had me on the edge of my seat, and hit me like a big bag of bricks. Just powerful, incredible stuff.

AS you see that Andy has finally grown up and now starts his life going to college the toys wonder what's going to happen to them and as you see the situations and shenanigans they get into we make you laugh as you see the incredible CGI animation that is this movie,  but also they have a wonderful moral built into the movie as well that make it a wonderful movie for both kids and adults to watch.

1253525,AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,B00275EHJG,RJ Smoove,"[1, 1]","The absolute best animation I have ever seen. How fitting, considering Toy Story was the pioneer of digital animation. I was four when the first Toy Story came out, and eight when the second one did. I pretty much grew up on Disney movies, Toy Story and Lion King being the two I watched most. Probably a few hundred times between the two of them (no exaggeration). I literally grew up with Woody, Buzz and the gang. Coincidentally, I started my first year of college last year, so Andy and I share a connection that is very personal to me. The people over at Pixar have done what has only happened a few times in history. Let's hope they take home the Oscar for Best Picture like the Lord of the Rings did, although I wouldn't get my hopes up. Those Academy douche bags... But back to Pixar. They created a damn near perfect trilogy. I loved this movie. This may be blasphemy to some of you, but I have to admit that Shrek 2 still holds the crown as my all time favorite animated film. After that is How To Train Your Dragon, then probably Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2 tied at third. Ratatouille is tied with Monster's Inc. for a very close fourth. As you can see, Pixar dominates my list, that does go on, by the way. Anyway, I think this was a perfect way to close the trilogy. The last fifteen minutes or so were very heartfelt and touching. I was on the verge of tears. When Woody said goodbye to Andy in the closing moments, I felt as if he was talking directly to me. The movie is altogether excellent.I have to admit that I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't impress me as much as everyone said it would. After reading over a dozen reviews with perfect scores, I had expectations that almost always lead to disappoint. I'm happy to say I was not. Not even close. The script is very well done. The music is just as great. The voice acting never felt insincere. And most importantly, I never got the feeling that some studio executive told the geniuses at Pixar to make this movie because it would clean out the pockets of millions of moviegoers I'm talking to you DreamWorks. I almost hated Shrek after the third movie, then they did a fourth?! No, I never got that feeling from this movie at all. It was a rejuvenation to a property that was already loved by almost everyone. The graphical detail in the picture was incredible. It saddens me to know that their adventures are over, but I'm glad it ended the way it did. Waiting eleven years to do the final entry was probably not intentional, but it worked out for the best. At least for me because of my age corresponding to Andy's. I'm really going to miss those toys. ""How is the BD transfer,"" one might ask. Simply put, it's ""Pixar Perfect"". Toy Story 3 comes with one of the best Disney/Pixar slipcovers available. Beautiful embossing, and the color scheme fits the film perfectly. As for the extra content, there is plenty. There is an audio commentary, and a Picture-in-Picture commentary, an abundance of featurettes, and the short that played prior to the film when it was in theatres (""Day & Night"").

1253526,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B00275EHJG,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","TOY STORY 3 is an awesome movie!  Hilarious & heartbreaking.  Witty & wise.  A must-see.That opening paragraph ought to be enough, but in case you need more, I'll try.  Honestly, though, it is a bit tough, because this movie delighted me on a much more personal and visceral level than most.  If you were a fan of the first two films (and I am HUGE fan), then TOY STORY 3 is a near perfect culmination and summation of both the surface stories of these beloved characters and the deeper themes of friendship, responsibility, aging, learning  & growing that the first films were.The toys of TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 are much older now.  Of course, they haven't really changed...they are always toys.  But their owner, Andy, is now just days from leaving for college, and he's packing up his room.  The toys are understandably very concerned:  will they go with Andy to college (highly unlikely), will they be consigned to the attic (not great, but there's always the hope that one day Andy will share his toys with his own children) or will they be consigned to the curbside garbage?  Through a series of misunderstandings, most of the toys end up being donated to a nearby Daycare Center, where they join a motley crew of other donated toys.  (And in the film's most inspired addition, they meet Ken...who is perfectly conceived.  He's a man, but he's meant to be a girl's toy, so his attitude is decidedly ""clothing/fashion friendly"".)  And all is not as it seems at this daycare center, from evil toys who run the nights like a less-than-benevolent dictatorship to the very young kids whose enjoyment of toys consist of bashing them on the floor.  Our poor friends are subjected to horrific abuse...and it's up to Woody, the original hero, voiced by Tom Hanks, to save them.(You'll notice I'm not spending a lot of time describing the toys.  Honestly, if you don't know them already, don't see TOY STORY 3 until you've enjoyed the other two.  It is absolutely essential that you know these characters already, because the filmmakers sure assume that you do.)The film is packed full of hilarious scenes (the ""escape from prison"" scene has the best Mr. Potato Head gag possible) and witty conceits (the aforementioned Ken, a dinosaur with a Facebook account, etc.)  As with the prior films, it has delightfully clever ""jokes only adults will get"" but as opposed to the SHREK movies, for example, it's tone is always one of childlike wonder.  TOY STORY 3 plays to an audience of kids...and yes, it's a total clich&eacute;...it plays to the kid in all of us.  In fact, to get the full emotional resonance of these films, you MUST be an adult.Once all the action and plot is nearly resolved, the film circles back to the issue that's been roiling underneath since the beginning of the film (and possibly even since the beginning of the series)...what happens to the devoted toys when their master outgrows them.  The final 10 minutes or so of the film will devastate you.  In a good way...but nonetheless, be prepared with extra tissue.

The whole of the movie - and the final scene in particular - tackle the concepts of loss, separation and one's own self worth. For me, personally, it brought up issues of death and grief, the idea of never seeing someone you care about ever again. It makes me wince to recall the images of the baby doll (""Big Baby"") left outside in the rain; walking away sadly, animated in a way that was so life-like, it seems too real.The movie wrung me out, physically drained and emotionally exhausted.It's hard for me to tell whether or not I actually liked the film. I wasn't as blown away as I expected to be - apart from the heart-twisting ending. I had hoped that the villain would have been a bit more different from the Prospector of Toy Story 2. I was aware going in that they didn't ""die"" in the landfill, so the sequence in which they all are headed for the fiery furnace didn't have much of an impact. I did feel the use of 3D in this movie and it left me a little disappointed. Even Pixar has succumbed to it, sadly. Granted, it wasn't nearly as bad as some other films have been.I know that I should probably see it again, but I'm not entirely sure I can. Or want to. It hit very close to home and I'm not sure I want to be that emotionally raw or depressed again anytime soon.Meanwhile, I thought the Pixar short film before the movie, ""Night and Day,"" was absolutely fantastic.

The latest iteration of the Toy Story series milks the generational span of the fans that were kids for the first in the series.  In the film, the toys are packed up and stored or discarded when their master, Andy, leaves for college.The journey the toys must take is a metaphor for the perils and spiritual fears many of us experience in real life.  The toys take a journey that literally leads to the gates of hell -- a yawning, gaping, molten fire-pit at a mammoth recycling center.  Not sure what the lesson is here, or how Jung might explain the symbolic meaning of the events and the identity of the toys themselves.  I always thought it was interesting that the two leads were called Buzz and Woody.  Drugs and sex seemed to more than an accidental inference.  There are other subversive moments disguised as a kid's movie.This is a reverse coming of age movie in which a human character comes to terms with his childhood and the non-human characters continue with their imagined lives.

Only little Andy ain't so little anymore, and as he embarks on a new life in college, his once-beloved companions fret over what is to become of them now that they'll no longer be getting the kind of attention and affection all toys need to be happy (actually they haven`t been getting much play time at all for the past few years of Andy`s adolescence).  Woody insists that they must stay loyal to Andy, but the others fear it may be time to move on to friendlier, more kid-centric territory or face an ignominious end, thrown to the curb so some giant garbage truck can scoop them up and mash them into plastic pulp.  Instead, through a series of crazy misunderstandings, they all wind up in the local daycare-center-from-hell (sort of a more sinister version of the Island of Misfit Toys), where they are placed at the mercy of both a band of overexcited toddlers and a bunch of sadistic playthings who rule the place with an iron fist.  Only Woody manages to escape their evil clutches and, like the true cowboy hero of old, he comes up with a plan to rescue his desperate compadres from this virtual armed camp, ironically named Sunnyside.It seems redundant at this point to keep heaping praise on these Pixar productions, so let me just say that ""Toy Story 3"" is a true crowd-pleasing delight, a witty, endlessly inventive, and visually stunning animated movie that works equally well for youngsters who are still playing with their toys and old folks who might well become inspired to head up to that old attic and dust off some long-forgotten buddies of their own.  The voice work by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Ned Beatty, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, Estelle Harris, et.al., brings each and every one of these charmingly diverse and beautifully differentiated characters to vivid life.  We're so familiar with them ourselves at this point that they almost feel like they came out of OUR toy boxes.  It's also fun watching the movie make villains out of some seemingly innocuous, even cuddly, toys like the embittered, strawberry-scented teddy bear who runs the joint and a diaper-clad baby doll that serves as his loyal henchman.In addition to high comedy, Michael Arndt`s script provides a careful balance of breath-bating suspense and heartbreaking sentiment (believe me, there won't be a dry eye in the house at the end), as it explores the universal themes of camaraderie, friendship and the importance of working together in a common cause.Whether young or old, 2-D or 3-D, at ""Toy Story 3,"" everyone can be a kid again.",5,a beautifully realized story about friendship,1296000000,"01 26, 2011",2011,2905,"['Lee', 'Unkrich', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'little', 'expanded', 'version', 'Puff', 'Magic', 'Dragon', 'crossed', 'Rankin/Bass', 'Rudolph', 'Red-nosed', 'Reindeer', 'bit', 'Stalag', '17', 'Great', 'Escape', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.It', 'eleven', 'years', 'last', 'checked', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'Jessie', 'other', 'occupants', 'little', 'Andy', 'toy', 'box', 'Only', 'little', 'Andy', 'ai', ""n't"", 'so', 'little', 'anymore', 'new', 'life', 'college', 'once-beloved', 'companions', 'fret', 'what', 'become', 'now', ""'ll"", 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'getting', 'kind', 'attention', 'affection', 'toys', 'need', 'be', 'happy', 'actually', 'haven', 't', 'been', 'getting', 'much', 'play', 'time', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Andy', 's', 'adolescence', 'Woody', 'must', 'stay', 'loyal', 'Andy', 'others', 'fear', 'may', 'be', 'time', 'move', 'friendlier', 'more', 'kid-centric', 'territory', 'face', 'ignominious', 'end', 'thrown', 'curb', 'so', 'giant', 'garbage', 'truck', 'can', 'scoop', 'up', 'mash', 'plastic', 'pulp', 'Instead', 'series', 'crazy', 'misunderstandings', 'wind', 'up', 'local', 'daycare-center-from-hell', 'sort', 'more', 'sinister', 'version', 'Island', 'Misfit', 'Toys', 'where', 'are', 'placed', 'mercy', 'band', 'overexcited', 'toddlers', 'bunch', 'sadistic', 'playthings', 'who', 'rule', 'place', 'iron', 'fist', 'Only', 'Woody', 'escape', 'evil', 'clutches', 'true', 'cowboy', 'hero', 'old', 'up', 'plan', 'rescue', 'desperate', 'compadres', 'virtual', 'armed', 'camp', 'ironically', 'named', 'Sunnyside.It', 'redundant', 'point', 'keep', 'heaping', 'praise', 'Pixar', 'productions', 'so', 'let', 'just', 'say', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'true', 'crowd-pleasing', 'delight', 'witty', 'endlessly', 'inventive', 'visually', 'stunning', 'animated', 'movie', 'equally', 'well', 'youngsters', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'playing', 'toys', 'old', 'folks', 'who', 'might', 'well', 'become', 'inspired', 'head', 'up', 'old', 'attic', 'dust', 'off', 'long-forgotten', 'buddies', 'own', 'voice', 'work', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Estelle', 'Harris', 'et.al.', 'one', 'charmingly', 'diverse', 'beautifully', 'differentiated', 'characters', 'vivid', 'life', ""'re"", 'so', 'familiar', 'point', 'almost', 'feel', 'came', 'OUR', 'toy', 'boxes', 'also', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'make', 'villains', 'seemingly', 'innocuous', 'even', 'cuddly', 'toys', 'embittered', 'strawberry-scented', 'teddy', 'bear', 'who', 'joint', 'diaper-clad', 'baby', 'doll', 'loyal', 'henchman.In', 'addition', 'high', 'comedy', 'Michael', 'Arndt', 's', 'script', 'careful', 'balance', 'breath-bating', 'suspense', 'heartbreaking', 'sentiment', 'believe', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dry', 'eye', 'house', 'end', 'universal', 'themes', 'camaraderie', 'friendship', 'importance', 'working', 'together', 'common', 'cause.Whether', 'young', 'old', '2-D', '3-D', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'everyone', 'can', 'be', 'kid', 'again']",Toy Story 3

The obvious cause of conflict is his departure: what to make of their existence without them being played around; after all, the nature of their being as toys is to be there to be played. Justifiably so, armed with tenacity and perseverance, the toys end up planning their escape from an inevitable ownerless future as either forgotten, dust-gathering toys in the attic, as toy donations, or worse, dumps in the trash. Andy makes a final decision to take Woody, and the rest of them goes to the attic; the toys sadly agreed, their loyalty will surely be repaid: Andy will be back again someday. Mistaken as trash by Andy's mom, however, the toys are dumped into a garbage truck. They manage to escape; soon, they find themselves in a nearby child care playroom, led by a seemingly innocuous adorable bear, Latso, who appears to have an entourage, one of them is Barbie's counterpart, Ken, and a huge unkempt baby doll, with scarred features. Latso ends up deceiving the newcomers to go to the section where young kids play without any trace of care or regard; whereas he and his turf stay in the older kid's section, where they are loved and cherished the way toys are. Eventually, Woody comes into rescue, and does it before Andy goes back to college for one last goodbye...In a fast-paced, hyperkinetic, and thoroughly entertaining manner, ""Toy Story 3"" delivers the fun and jokes. Indeed, it is a very good and worthy film to serve as the final bookend of the trilogy. Sure, it does not pick up until the second act, where the toys are trapped in the day care, and Woody makes an elaborate escape plan, but the inventiveness and the fresh takes on being an escapee from a prison is brilliant here, especially Mr. Potato Head's decision to use a tortilla as his body, as his former one has been discarded. Another clever and hilarious sequence involves a cymbal banging monkey, serving for Latso, as it watches the security cameras, guarding anyone who would leave the prison, banging and screeching as soon as it sees something suspicious. Regardless of this merriment, however, the film is lacking the humanity and the undercurrent of introspective melancholy that have seared underneath the workings of the first two films, particularly the second one. The merriment found in ""Toy Story 3"", as genuinely crowd-pleasing as it is, seems displaced and unwarranted, being that this is the third and last film in the series.One could say that this is a kid's film, after all, but we are also talking about Pixar Films here, who have a penchant for peppering their films with darkness and even cruelty that only adults and discerning children could truly understand and appreciate. So, it is by the virtue of the consistent regularity of churning out complex works that one is justifiable in expecting something that could match and even surpass the intense humanity of the previous two films that ""Toy Story 3"" will bring everything into a close that is a moving and transcendental work of art. What we get is rather a fairly conventional, though no less heartbreaking account of moving on and transitioning into a different phase of life. What makes it conventional and admittedly, actually frustrating, is that in this film, it is all about Andy, a boy who has already been growing older since the second film, and whose interests are slowly evolving from cowboy toys to real cowgirls; and frankly, a character whom we truly never had a real connection with, in the first place. Thus, the conclusion seems an alternative to a real one; as earnest and moving as it is, it is unearned, and thus, cheaply sentimental, when it should be a genuinely primal type of poignancy; that type of pain that forever twinges the throbbing heart.Seeing Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and co., risking their lives for one boy, whose goals and function in life has changed due to biological transition, is a frustrating experience. Their characterizations that have been lovingly and delicately realized in the first and second film have now been rendered rather secondary to, at best, in-jokes, audience familiarity, and as fodder for elaborate set pieces, and at worse, subservient to Andy's. What makes the first and second film brilliant are the toys' humanity as a focal point; meaning, their struggling existence serve as basis for everything, including the existence of Andy and other human beings, and not the other way around; after all, this is why it's called ""Toy Story"". Andy, in other words, is merely a catalyst, ironically speaking; he is rendered inhuman, as the toys are human, and their struggles are response, either as a reaction or a pro-action, in relation to Andy's non-existence, and alongside these struggles, these toys are increasingly becoming complex. In the third film, we never get to see any of this: the whole plan of going back to Andy's arms is all action, and it is great action, but it never has that melancholy quality which all at once, further develops the characters. In turn, they merely lapse back to the toys that they are, which seems to be the point: they are toys, after all, regardless whether or not they have a life on their own; and being toys -subservient, naively loyal, even stupid- is their  function. However, the philosophical existential implications of the ""Toy Story"" films have always been apparent, even in the first film: despite manufactured at toy factories, these toys have their own distinct personalities, capable of feeling happiness and loneliness, and have a will of their own. They are active agents, even if it is only when the humans are not around to see them. Thus, the counter-argument is rendered moot.The endless possibilities of one's nature of existence exist at the very outset of the concept of these toys having a life of their own, and there are many possibilities. With their own consciousness, they are able to think; and with thinking, and its endless discourse, surely, at some point, they are able to transcend their mode of consciousness, which is merely on the basis of them being toys, into something that is on the basis of their existence as living, thinking beings, regardless of their lack of biological mechanisms. In other words, thinking, in its own nature, whether or not the thinker is a human or a non-object, is continually ahead of itself; thus, thinking alone is always at the cusp of immense potential for continual evolution. This is probably why the now infamous furnace scene, where the toys linked hands as a sign of their embracing of death, is transgressively brilliant, ethereally moving, and subversively dark: not merely because they have lost their purpose as toys, but almost as a defiant gesture to the naysayers who are underestimating their capabilities for continual transformation, these perhaps include the filmmakers. It is an act that is simultaneously a hopeless surrender, almost a suicide, in the face of a bleak world; and at the same time, as a full realization of their demise, a renunciation of their capabilities of their thinking, conscious beings; thus paradoxically rendering themselves as human as possible.Of course, one is not necessarily clamouring for an existential, nihilistic work here, especially if it is a film whose main audiences are children, even if one is, it is forever pointless. It is a real shame, however, since the predecessors have been subversive works of acute longing for human contact and perpetual love, one's expectations have heightened even to impossible proportions. ""Toy Story 3"" is untapped with unrealized potentials that remain merely lurking at the corners of its every frame. The filmmakers had something truly special and beautiful here, but perhaps, they thought happy, content kids are better than disturbed, distraught, crying ones; if that's the case, then I'll stick with peaceful environs too.",4,"Great Innocuous Entertainment, but Disappointing on Revolutionary Cinematic Grounds",1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,8115,"['Toy', 'Story', '3', 'return', 'beloved',

Both Day and Night have their pros and cons which we see.  Ah the nightlife of Vegas!  Ah, the beach girls in summer!Many years ago, most films had a cartoon and a newsreel before starting the main picture.  In fact, there were these things called ""double features"" which you don't see too much of, which had two films playing for a single admission price.  Good old days.Anyway, back to the main event:  Andy's toys are being boxed up and he's on his way to college.  Through an accident, most of Andy's toys almost get trashed (to a toy, being trashed is the same as hell!).  Thanks to some of Woody's (cowboy toy) actions they escape only to end up in Sunnydale, a preschool that has the apparency of lots of kids playing with toys, to being beaten up and busted apart by little children!The toys are not happy with being treated like hammers and paint brushes and want to be played with.  Too bad says ""Lotso"", a large, toy bear who is literally a dictator running the toy show at the preschool.I came away from the movie with the idea that there are several ways to handle rejection.  Some of the toys, like Lotso, handled rejection by becoming bitter and treating others badly.  He came up with the false idea that ""everyone"" treats toys like hand-me-downs, that they can easily be replaced, and that they are not appreciated and will eventually be trashed.Andy's toys however deal with rejection in a different way.  They too feel that they are being rejected and trashed.  But they also understand that Andy is growing up and no longer has a need for toys.  They're not too keen with ending up in the attic storage but at least they won't be trashed.  But these toys are flexible:  All they want is to be played with.Finally, Woody is not too keen on being trashed either.  But he wants to maintain status quo.  He feels that they all belong to Andy and should be loyal to him.All three groups have an epiphany of sorts.  Some adapt and well, some just don't change and end up on the wrong side of (something) (no spoilers, sorry!).There are some scenes that might be a bit intense for smaller kids, but I think Pixar earned its five stars because of what it created here has a story lesson, is not knocking you upside the head with its moral lessons, has some conflict and resolution and is fun to watch.For me, not as charming and fun as Wall-E or Up, but still highly recommended for the kids in your life.",5,Escape from the Toy Box!

Pixar defied the curse with ""Toy Story 2"", which was better than the original - could they manage it again?  Indeed, they have.  Let us give no thought to the nightmare scenario where this film would have been made by Disney separate from Pixar, before Roy E. Disney (God rest his soul) thankfully saved the day.  Some spoilers follow.Picking up eleven years after the original, Andy (voiced again by John Morris) is 17 and off to college, and the once plentiful band of toys in his room have been whittled down to a few favourites (conveniently corresponding to the main characters, plus three remaining plastic army men), who now await news of what is to become of them.  ""Toy Story 2"" ended with the band vowing to face the uncertain future with Andy, and now the moment of truth has arrived.  Through a variety of circumstances, the toys are separated from their owner, and arrive at Sunnyside Daycare, a place that promises the possibility of always having children to play with them.  It's ruled by the seemingly benevolent Lotso-Huggin'-Bear (Ned Beatty), assisted by Ken (Michael Keaton, genius), who immediately strikes a bond with one of Molly's old Barbie dolls (""The Little Mermaid""'s Jodi Benson).  Woody (Tom Hanks) alone doesn't like this new arrangement...and of course, there's a catch.""Toy Story 3"" is simultaneously the funniest of the three films, and the saddest.  On the former score, there's a certain zip and occasional innuendo to this one that wasn't really present in the previous two (shots of which in the trailers led to people worrying about the potential Shrekification of the franchise; that is not the case).  In particular, poor Ken is relentlessly mined for laughs - yet at the same time as he is skewered so thoroughly, he's also a genuine character, a feat one suspects most studios wouldn't bother with (Dreamworks certainly wouldn't).  Barbie, likewise, is a surprisingly strong character.  The core of the movie remains, of course, Woody and Buzz (Tim Allen; in something good for the first time in a while; as a big fan of ""Home Improvement"", it gladdens my heart), still as fast allies as ever, though time always tests their bond.  The big challenge of this particular film is the looming possibility of irrelevancy - witness the heart-tugging moment where we learn that Bo Peep, Woody's girlfriend from the first two films, is gone, probably never to be seen again.  It makes sense, but it still hurts.A passel of new characters, apart from the aforementioned Lotso and Ken, are also introduced, and they are expertly juggled; they contribute to the setting, but are never allowed to completely take over the show from the characters we've followed from the first two films (I'd have liked to be more of the theatrical porcupine, personally; the triceratops was fun too).  There's many a franchise that could learn from this film how to handle new additions to old properties.  And especially important among the new additions is the new human character, Bonnie, a charming little girl who Woody temporarily resides with.  She's set up for an important role for the toys, and she comes across as completely worth of the responsibility that is eventually bestowed on her.Bottom line:  On returning from the theatre, I immediately went to the closet and got out some of my old stuffed animals, who I hadn't seen in a few years.  This is a powerful movie about both nostalgia and facing tomorrow, and it's a lot of fun besides.  Don't miss it (and screw you, Armond White).",5,"""Toy Story 3"" is complete and total fanservice, aimed primarily at twentysomethings like this reviewer",1276905600,"06 19, 2010",2010,3712,"['loved', 'minute', 'it.Sequels', 'are', 'always', 'tricky', 'business', 'second', 'sequels', 'even', 'moreso', 'become', 'conventional', 'wisdom', 'superhero', 'always', 'derail', 'third', 'movie', 'Pixar', 'defied', 'curse', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'was', 'better', 'original', 'could', 'manage', 'again', 'Indeed', 'have', 'Let', 'give', 'thought', 'nightmare', 'scenario', 'where', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'Disney', 'separate', 'Pixar', 'Roy', 'E.', 'Disney', 'God', 'rest', 'soul', 'thankfully', 'saved', 'day', 'spoilers', 'follow.Picking', 'up', 'eleven', 'years', 'original', 'Andy', 'voiced', 'again', 'John', 'Morris', '17', 'college', 'once', 'plentiful', 'band', 'toys', 'room', 'have', 'been', 'whittled', 'down', 'few', 'favourites', 'conveniently', 'corresponding', 'main', 'characters', 'three', 'remaining', 'plastic', 'army', 'men', 'who', 'now', 'await', 'news', 'what', 'become', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'ended', 'band', 'vowing', 'face', 'uncertain', 'future', 'Andy', 'now', 'moment', 'truth', 'arrived', 'variety', 'circumstances', 'toys', 'are', 'separated', 'owner', 'arrive', 'Sunnyside', 'Daycare', 'place', 'possibility', 'always', 'having', 'children', 'play', 'ruled', 'seemingly', 'benevolent', ""Lotso-Huggin'-Bear"", 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'assisted', 'Ken', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'genius', 'who', 'immediately', 'bond', 'one', 'Molly', 'old', 'Barbie', 'Little', 'Mermaid', 'Jodi', 'Benson', 'Woody', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'alone', ""n't"", 'like', 'new', 'arrangement', 'course', 'catch', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'simultaneously', 'funniest', 'three', 'films', 'saddest', 'former', 'score', 'certain', 'zip', 'occasional', 'innuendo', 'one', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'present', 'previous', 'two', 'shots', 'trailers', 'led', 'people', 'worrying', 'potential', 'Shrekification', 'franchise', 'not', 'case', 'particular', 'poor', 'Ken', 'relentlessly', 'mined', 'laughs', 'yet', 'same', 'time', 'skewered', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'also', 'genuine', 'character', 'feat', 'one', 'most', 'studios', 'would', ""n't"", 'bother', 'Dreamworks', 'certainly', 'would', ""n't"", 'Barbie', 'likewise', 'surprisingly', 'strong', 'character', 'core', 'movie', 'course', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'something', 'good', 'first', 'time', 'while', 'big', 'fan', 'Home', 'Improvement', 'heart', 'still', 'fast', 'allies', 'ever', 'time', 'always', 'bond', 'big', 'challenge', 'particular', 'film', 'looming', 'possibility', 'irrelevancy', 'witness', 'heart-tugging', 'moment', 'where', 'learn', 'Bo', 'Peep', 'Woody', 'girlfriend', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'gone', 'probably', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'sense', 'still', 'passel', 'new', 'characters', 'apart', 'aforementioned', 'Lotso', 'Ken', 'are', 'also', 'introduced', 'are', 'expertly', 'juggled', 'contribute', 'setting', 'are', 'never', 'allowed', 'completely', 'take', 'over', 'show', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'followed', 'first', 'two', 'films', ""'d"", 'have', 'liked', 'be', 'more', 'theatrical', 'porcupine', 'personally', 'triceratops', 'was', 'fun', 'too', 'many', 'franchise', 'could', 'learn', 'film', 'how', 'handle', 'new', 'additions', 'old', 'properties', 'especially', 'important', 'new', 'additions', 'new', 'human', 'character', 'Bonnie', 'charming', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'Woody', 'temporarily', 'resides', 'set', 'up', 'important', 'role', 'toys', 'completely', 'responsibility', 'eventually', 'bestowed', 'her.Bottom', 'line', 'returning', 'theatre', 'immediately', 'went', 'closet', 'got', 'out', 'old', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'who', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'few', 'years', 'powerful', 'movie', 'nostalgia', 'facing', 'tomorrow', 'lot', 'fun', 'besides', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'screw', 'Armond', 'White']",Toy Story 3

I know this for sure because at the top of the Amazon Toy Story / Toy Story 2 combo pack product page it says, ""You purchased this item on November 28, 2001."" Wow...how time flies.So it was to my surprise that when my son, now 11, stayed home from school with a cold earlier this year, I found him watching Toy Story. He had just put the DVD in the player, so I sat with him for a second before I headed off to work. Then the second turned into a few minutes; then a few minutes turned into a nostalgic hour; which of course turned into, ""What a great, classic movie, Dad; Let's watch Toy Story 2!"" So I obliged. (I hope my boss isn't reading this.)I'd forgotten what classics Toy Story and Toy Story 2 are. And it turns out that Toy Story 3 is just as classic as the first two. Not only do these movies deserve just a viewing, they deserve to be added to your movie collection. Watched the Blu Ray version last night with the entire family, and had to buy the standard DVD today, because my 7 year old daughter insisted that she needs to be able to watch the movie several times...but ""upstairs"" where i don't have a Blu Ray player set up. No problem. I may be biased because of the strong emotional attachment that I found that I had and have renewed with these movies, but I say that all three Toy Story movies truly are collectors' items.While watching Toy Story 3 last night, just as when I watched the first two again earlier this year, I was laughing out loud, holding in the sobs and just plain enjoying perhaps the best animated movies ever to come out of Disney.The first is about Andy's (6 - 8 years old?) toys and what happens when Andy introduces his new Buzz Lightyear to the group of toys that he grew up with. But the toys better be sure to stay out of the hands of Andy's next door neighbor Sid, because Sid's idea of fun is toy torture! Then in Toy Story 2 it's spring cleanup time, and the toys better hide if they don't want to end up in the yard sale; especially if you're a rare toy and there are greedy toy collectors that would just love to have...er..I mean...sell you. Finally in Toy Story 3 Andy is all grown up and the Toys have to deal with wondering if Andy will take them to college (a bad bet), keep them in his room (probably not or....Donate them or....Throw them out in the trash?!?Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are once again magic together in Toy Story 3 and they are joined by a cast of many many A-list voice talents...Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head is my favorite (ya hockey puck!).And one more note, if you've ever seen the Buzz LightyearDisney Channel spinoffbut not the movies, don't be dissuaded by the spinoff because it was silly in comparison; the movies are head and shoulders above the spinoff in acting, animation and storywise.I'd grab the whole collection and see Toy Story 1 & 2 before 3 if you haven't already...it really puts things in perspective to watch it chronologically.

1253565,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B00275EHJG,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[1, 3]","There is a scene near the end of Toy Story 3 that took me by intense surprise, the core Toys (Buzz, Woody, Jesse and a few others) are faced with the prospect of destruction. I won't go into detail as to how, but in this scene, Jesse states ""Buzz, what do we do now?"" and Buzz, turning to Jesse with a deep sadness and longing showing on his plastic face; simply grabs her hand and squeezes. Jesse in turn grabs the hand of Bullseye and the chain comes full circle with Buzz and Woody grabbing hands.  This moment was shocking in it's deepness, how toys could make me feel sad, yet uplifted by their intense love for one another, and that these toys could come to terms with their ""death"" because of the love they share.This aforementioned scene is one of the reasons I so truly love Pixar films.  The depth and emotional resonance that John Lasseter and his group of magicians put into every fiber of their films. Their understanding of love, their ability to show loss in a simple and understandable yet heartwrenching way, and their ability to show toys, fish, or insects how to let go.The beginning and end of the Toy Story legacy is with a child.  15 years ago, we were introduced to Andy; a fun loving cute little guy who was madly in love with his toys.  The strong and kind Woody, the brave and stalwart Buzz, the sweet yet scared Rex, The feisty Potato Heads, the loyal and loving Slinky and a few other adored toys made up a family of playthings held together by one thing, the love a little boy.  His imagination could make them soar and they felt blessed each day.  Along the way in Toy Story 2 we picked up Jesse and her best pal Bullseye the horse.  And in these films we saw the love and companionship these objects had for one another.  A love that would help them get out of some VERY sticky and genuinely scary situations. But all road lead back to their BEST friend...Andy.That is the heart of Toy Story 3. What happens when your Best Friend grows up? Are you a has been? a nothing? just so much trash? If the boy you adored and who adored you back grew away from you, where do you go? Would you feel betrayed? indifferent? scared silly? or would you hang on to that love til the last breath? This is the story of Toy Story 3, when by accident, the toys are sent to Sunnyside Day Care. A bright and sunshiny haven on first look, but a sadistic toy prison run by a bitter toy under it all.  Do you succumb to your predicament or fight to get where you belong?And what of that child, what does he wish for his friends? All these questions are set up, played out and answered by the end of this magical and spellbinding film.  Now to the technical, the voice cast was once again superb.  Tom Hanks and Tim Allen as the voices of Woody and Buzz play so well off each other. Joan Cusack brings a sensitivity and strength to Jesse that is uncanny. And the rest of the cast is fantastic as well, and ALL the original are back save Jim Varney and one other whose name escapes me. The graphics are; as always for a Pixar film; amazing.  The toys themselves never looked so good.  They have a sheen and detail the 1st and 2nd lacked.  The story as I've said is enchanting, hitting notes of hilarity, concern, and deep deep sadness and loss. But does all this make it a perfect film? In my opinion...Yes.Toy Story 3 is Pixars 11th feature film, and in my opinion surpasses ALL previous films. Yes, even Wall-e. The mix of perfect casting, enchanting graphics and a pitch perfect story that takes us all on an adventure but lands safely in the perfect and only place.  The last few minutes of the film is a perfect closure to this wonderful franchise, yet a beautiful opening to a whole new life for the toys! A life blessed with the love of a child. You'll walk out feeling like a child again yourself, yet with a deep sense of loving closure.Toy Story 3 is a masterpiece.",5,"Toy Story 3...Love, Loss and Letting Go",1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,3880,"['scene', 'end', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'took', 'intense', 'surprise', 'core', 'Toys', 'Buzz', 'Woody', 'Jesse', 'few', 'others', 'are', 'faced', 'prospect', 'destruction', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'detail', 'how', 'scene', 'Jesse', 'Buzz', 'what', 'do', 'do', 'now', 'Buzz', 'turning', 'Jesse', 'deep', 'sadness', 'longing', 'showing', 'plastic', 'face', 'simply', 'grabs', 'hand', 'squeezes', 'Jesse', 'turn', 'grabs', 'hand', 'Bullseye', 'chain', 'full', 'circle', 'Buzz', 'Woody', 'grabbing', 'hands', 'moment', 'was', 'shocking', 'deepness', 'how', 'toys', 'could', 'make', 'feel', 'sad', 'yet', 'uplifted', 'intense', 'love', 'one', 'toys', 'could', 'come', 'terms', 'death', 'love', 'share.This', 'aforementioned', 'scene', 'one', 'reasons', 'so', 'truly', 'love', 'Pixar', 'films', 'depth', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'John', 'Lasseter', 'group', 'magicians', 'put', 'fiber', 'films', 'understanding', 'love', 'ability', 'show', 'loss', 'simple', 'understandable', 'yet', 'heartwrenching', 'way', 'ability', 'show', 'toys', 'fish', 'how', 'let', 'go.The', 'beginning', 'end', 'Toy', 'Story', 'legacy', 'child', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'introduced', 'Andy', 'fun', 'loving', 'cute', 'little', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'madly', 'love', 'toys', 'strong', 'kind', 'Woody', 'brave', 'stalwart', 'Buzz', 'sweet', 'yet', 'scared', 'Rex', 'feisty', 'Potato', 'Heads', 'loyal', 'loving', 'Slinky', 'few', 'other', 'adored', 'toys', 'made', 'up', 'family', 'playthings', 'held', 'together', 'one', 'thing', 'love', 'little', 'boy', 'imagination', 'could', 'make', 'soar', 'felt', 'blessed', 'day', 'way', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'picked', 'up', 'Jesse', 'best', 'pal', 'Bullseye', 'horse', 'films', 'saw', 'love', 'companionship', 'objects', 'had', 'one', 'love', 'would', 'help', 'get', 'VERY', 'sticky', 'genuinely', 'scary', 'situations', 'road', 'lead', 'back', 'BEST', 'friend', 'heart', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'What', 'when', 'Best', 'Friend', 'up', 'Are', 'been', 'nothing', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'trash', 'boy', 'adored', 'who', 'adored', 'back', 'grew', 'away', 'where', 'do', 'go', 'Would', 'feel', 'betrayed', 'indifferent', 'scared', 'silly', 'would', 'hang', 'love', 'til', 'last', 'breath', 'story', 'Toy', 'Story', '3', 'when', 'accident', 'toys', 'are', 'sent', 'Sunnyside', 'Day', 'Care', 'bright', 'sunshiny', 'haven', 'first', 'look', 'sadistic', 'toy', 'prison', 'run', 'bitter', 'toy', 'Do', 'succumb', 'predicament', 'fight', 'get', 'where', 'belong', 'what', 'child', 'what', 'wish', 'friends', 'questions', 'are', 'set', 'up', 'played', 'out', 'answered', 'end', 'magical', 'spellbinding', 'film', 'Now', 'technical', 'voice', 'cast', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'superb', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'voices', 'Woody', 'Buzz', 'play', 'so', 'well', 'other', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'sensitivity', 'strength', 'Jesse', 'uncanny', 'rest', 'cast', 'fantastic', 'as', 'well', 'original', 'are', 'back', 'save', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'one', 'other', 'name', 'graphics', 'are', 'always', 'Pixar', 'film', 'amazing', 'toys', 'never', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'have', 'sheen', 'detail', '1st', '2nd', 'lacked', 'story', ""'ve"", 'said', 'enchanting', 'hitting', 'notes', 'hilarity', 'concern', 'deep', 'deep', 'sadness', 'loss', 'make', 'perfect', 'film', 'opinion', 'Yes.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'Pixars', '11th', 'feature', 'film', 'opinion', 'ALL', 'previous', 'films', 'Yes', 'even', 'Wall-e', 'mix', 'perfect', 'casting', 'enchanting', 'graphics', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'story', 'adventure', 'safely', 'perfect', 'only', 'place', 'last', 'few', 'minutes', 'film', 'perfect', 'closure', 'wonderful', 'franchise', 'beautiful', 'opening', 'whole', 'new', 'life', 'toys', 'life', 'blessed', 'love', 'child', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'feeling', 'child', 'again', 'yet', 'deep', 'sense', 'loving', 'closure.Toy', 'Story', '3', 'masterpiece']",Toy Story 3

But soon it comes to light that all is not quite what it seems and this rapidly turns into a prison break film, with all of the genre in-gags that that entails.This film has all the old characters we have grown to love, as well as some new ones to keep things interesting. These include a camp Ken doll, a fiendish pink teddy bear and a Ghibli Totoro toy. The hilarious voice-over talents are prevalent throughout and that special brand of humour unique to Toy Story films is still there. This has a great storyline to keep kids interested and the numerous smaller touches adults will notice to keep things feeling fresh and which Pixar have become renowned for. The animation is as superb as always and I really noticed how well the trees were rendered and the use of light, these may have stood our more on Blu-ray, but they are impressive regardless.All in all this is a worthy successor to the other films and if you enjoyed the previous films (and to be honest didn't we all!) then you should find this enjoyable too. They left things nicely tied up and hopefully Pixar won't feel the urge to rehash this particular franchise as it still has a warm place in many hearts and this film only adds to that.

The beginning of the movie finds Andy's toys figuring out a way to stay in his life when he packs up to head off to college.  Unexpectedly, they find themselves working together to get out of some sticky daycare adventures they find themselves in courtesy of a bear that turns out to be different from what he appears and his assistant Big Baby. The group of Andy's end up realizing even more the importance of teamwork to help stay together. I also thought the addition of the Barbie and Ken characters added some creativity and life to the animation. However, the two main characters of Toy Story 3 were Buzz Lightyear and Woody, who were very much brought to life in an excellent fashion. There were other toys that were creatively woven into the story (such as Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Stretch, Chunk, Sparks, Jack-In-the box and others that appeared) , but the characters of Buzz Lightyear and Woody were animated to play visible roles in the evolution of the plot.

1253574,A1C9GCHR99WX3F,B00275EHJG,Stephen Verhaeren,"[0, 1]","The toys finally return after 1999's Toy Story 2 movie, but which is rare for 3 movies to have good reviews animated or not. It is rare for 3 films to be this strong, even without running out of gas at some point, how many can say that? There are a of returning toys, and then some new toys including Barbie getting her Ken. Or does she I am going to leave it up to you to find out. And seeing this being a Disney-PIXAR film, I was expecting this to get and win for best animated feature film, these films seem to be a lock for it. While I am lost to tell you what I liked best about this film, I can tell you do things that I didn't lkike the film, there are a couple. One I didn't like and that I was hoping that it wasn't going to, but did anyways the words idiot and moron are used in the film. But I realized that they used in the first 2 movies they had either one or both the words in the movies. The movie opens with the toys in a western opening scene with some of them good guys and others like Hamm on the bad guys. Then they have a montage of Andy growing up. Then we get to really the present of the movie where Andy ( voiced by John Morris) is now 17 years old, and now is getting set to leave home for college. And he stills lives with his mom and kid sister, Molly that we also get to see more grown up. The toys are now bound for his toy chest, or the ones that are left over, including Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark replacing the late Jim Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), and the Potato Heads Mr. and Mrs. (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris). The toy soliders are still around, lead by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey)  decide their time is up, and time to leave, before they end up in garbage bags. All the rest of the toys are not in the film, but the film does mention 2 of the toys tat are gone, but never really explains what happened to them, other then they had gone missing. Or even gone on to better owners. So while the toys place a phone call on a phone to Andy, whose cell phone is in with the toys, just hoping to be played with again. But Andy has pretty much grown up, and he believes and warns his baby sister Molly (Beatrice Miller), about staying out of his room. Then his Mom (Laurie Metcalf) tells Andy that it is time to clean his room, which includes packing up for garbage, throwing trash out. And which includes his toys, that they either have to be packed away for college, or put in the attic or they will be thrown away. And he does it, he places all but Woody in Trash bags, meaning to take them up to the attic. Woody is packed in the box for college, but gets out, and Andy is about to put the bag of toys in the attic, when he leaves them on the floor, and the doors closes itself for the attic, to help Molly out, and his Mom finds the bag and assumes it is garbage. The big problem, the only toy that really saw what happened is Woody, and when he finds the rest of the toys, once they have been taken to the garbage. But they mange to sneak into her car, and along with Molly's old toys, they are donated to a daycare named Sunnyside. Where they are welcomed by Lots-O'Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty ) who turns out to be the movie, and we also meet Ken (Ned Beatty).  They are assigned to a room with the toddlers, which leads to playtime that they didn't expect or want. The rest of the movie I am going to leave up to you. One other problem I do have with the movie, there is not a whole lot of new music in this movie, there is only one new song that plays during the end credits, and I really don't think that it is memorable enough, or good enough for Best Original Song, which it got nominated for and one, the only other song that plays during the movie is You've got a Friend in Me once again sung by Randy Newman.",4,The toys are back in town,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",2011,3852,"['toys', 'finally', 'return', '1999', 'Toy', 'Story', '2', 'movie', 'rare', '3', 'movies', 'have', 'good', 'reviews', 'animated', 'not', 'rare', '3', 'films', 'be', 'strong', 'even', 'running', 'out', 'gas', 'point', 'how', 'many', 'can', 'say', 'are', 'returning', 'toys', 'then', 'new', 'toys', 'including', 'Barbie', 'getting', 'Ken', 'am', 'going', 'leave', 'up', 'find', 'out', 'seeing', 'being', 'Disney-PIXAR', 'film', 'was', 'expecting', 'get', 'win', 'best', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'lock', 'am', 'lost', 'tell', 'what', 'liked', 'best', 'film', 'can', 'tell', 'do', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'lkike', 'film', 'are', 'couple', 'One', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'hoping', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'did', 'anyways', 'words', 'idiot', 'moron', 'are', 'used', 'film', 'realized', 'used', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'had', 'one', 'words', 'movies', 'movie', 'toys', 'western', 'opening', 'scene', 'good', 'guys', 'others', 'Hamm', 'bad', 'guys', 'Then', 'have', 'montage', 'Andy', 'growing', 'up', 'Then', 'get', 'really', 'present', 'movie', 'where', 'Andy', 'voiced', 'John', 'Morris', 'now', '17', 'years', 'old', 'now', 'getting', 'set', 'leave', 'home', 'college', 'mom', 'kid', 'sister', 'Molly', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'grown', 'up', 'toys', 'are', 'now', 'toy', 'chest', 'ones', 'are', 'left', 'over', 'including', 'Woody', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Buzz', 'Lightyear', 'Tim', 'Allen', 'Jessie', 'Cowgirl', 'Joan', 'Cusack', 'Slinky', 'Dog', 'Blake', 'Clark', 'replacing', 'late', 'Jim', 'Varney', 'Rex', 'Wallace', 'Shawn', 'Hamm', 'John', 'Ratzenberger', 'Potato', 'Heads', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Don', 'Rickles', 'Estelle', 'Harris', 'toy', 'soliders', 'are', 'still', 'lead', 'Sarge', 'R.', 'Lee', 'Ermey', 'decide', 'time', 'up', 'time', 'leave', 'end', 'up', 'garbage', 'bags', 'rest', 'toys', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'film', 'mention', '2', 'toys', 'are', 'gone', 'never', 'really', 'what', 'happened', 'other', 'then', 'had', 'gone', 'missing', 'even', 'gone', 'better', 'owners', 'So', 'toys', 'place', 'phone', 'call', 'phone', 'Andy', 'cell', 'phone', 'toys', 'just', 'hoping', 'be', 'played', 'again', 'Andy', 'pretty', 'much', 'grown', 'up', 'baby', 'sister', 'Molly', 'Beatrice', 'Miller', 'about', 'staying', 'room', 'Then', 'Mom', 'Laurie', 'Metcalf', 'Andy', 'time', 'clean', 'room', 'packing', 'up', 'garbage', 'throwing', 'trash', 'toys', 'have', 'be', 'packed', 'away', 'college', 'put', 'attic', 'will', 'be', 'thrown', 'away', 'Woody', 'Trash', 'bags', 'meaning', 'take', 'up', 'attic', 'Woody', 'packed', 'box', 'college', 'out', 'Andy', 'put', 'bag', 'toys', 'attic', 'when', 'floor', 'doors', 'attic', 'help', 'Molly', 'out', 'Mom', 'bag', 'garbage', 'big', 'problem', 'only', 'toy', 'really', 'saw', 'what', 'happened', 'Woody', 'when', 'rest', 'toys', 'once', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'garbage', 'mange', 'sneak', 'car', 'Molly', 'old', 'toys', 'are', 'donated', 'daycare', 'named', 'Sunnyside', 'Where', 'are', 'welcomed', ""Lots-O'Huggin"", 'Bear', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'movie', 'also', 'meet', 'Ken', 'Ned', 'Beatty', 'are', 'assigned', 'room', 'toddlers', 'playtime', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'want', 'rest', 'movie', 'am', 'going', 'leave', 'up', 'One', 'other', 'problem', 'do', 'have', 'movie', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'new', 'music', 'movie', 'only', 'one', 'new', 'song', 'end', 'credits', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'memorable', 'enough', 'good', 'enough', 'Best', 'Original', 'Song', 'got', 'nominated', 'one', 'only', 'other', 'song', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Friend', 'Me', 'once', 'again', 'sung', 'Randy', 'Newman']",Toy Story 3
1253575,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00275EHJG,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[3, 4]","Okay, so there are well over 150 reviews of the film posted already, so I don't need to go into details of the plot again. I was probably one of the few who did not see the film when it was released in theaters and so the DVD (not the Blu-ray) was my first chance to see it.While the name Disney is synonymous with  ""Kid's movie"", this one - like Up really hits the mark with adults - especially ""baby boomers"". Why? For a few reasons:1. The toys themselves are ""baby boomer"" icons: Mr. (and Mrs.) Potato Head, Slinky, Barbie and Ken and the very sly - and somewhat crude - reference to Lincoln Logs)2. There are way too many scary scenes - the final incinerator one, most of all - that look too realistic and will certainly scare children under 6 or 7.3. The script is written so to not bore the older viewers, but there are sections which little ones will find boring. And the viewer has to really understand the relationship of Barbie and Ken to get the many scenes they have. (And they are fun!)4. The Pixar detail is so wonderful and detailed - again the detail in the incinerator belt - that adults will be more impressed than children.5. Finally it'll be the adults who will relate to Andy having to leave his ""pals"" and will shed a tear at the end. (I certainly did).The bonus features on the DVD will also appeal to adults more than kids. The making of film, the short Pixar films and the brief ""Buzz Lightyear"" short made for NASA will be lost on any kids under 10.So, I'm here to rave about the film and encourage adults to buy this for themselves - even if they don't have children.

1253586,A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O,B00275EHJG,The Trophy,"[9, 35]",".......................................................................(THIS REVIEW CONTAINS  SPOILERS)..........................To make a long story short, I was there for Toy Story 1 and 2, played the video games, had some Toy Story folders, and other merchandise growing up. So you can bet I was excited to see they were coming out with a 3rd Toy Story movie. Went to see it a couple of days ago...and maybe it's because I was a bit tired (Thanks to some people who parked in front of my house at 5:00 AM and woke me up when they started talking and bouncing a basketball while I had my bedroom windows open)that I didn't take to this movie.First things first, I didn't like the beginning. It seemed very rushed and forced upon you. The toys all started freaking out that they were going to get donated,and that's all we heard. Even if there was little proof of it happening. Then Andy opens the attic door and it closes when he walks away. Andy set the bag with the toys RIGHT UNDER THE PULL DOWN ATTIC DOOR and his mom just assumes it's garbage and puts it on the curb?!?! Okay, she didn't take notice of where the bag was at?!?! I mean, maybe Andy didn't get the time yet to open up the attic door and put his toys away!!??!Also, a LOT of cool toys from the original two movies are gone,which is to be expected.  kids do get rid of stuff overtime and a lot of parents love putting things out for yard sales, but the problem is no one is there in their place. Sure they tried to put other toys in this movie from the day care or from Bonnie's house, but MOST of those toys, beside the hedgehog, Ken, and Hugs-A-Lot Bear have little or no on screen time for you to get a feel for them as a character, learn their personality, or become attached to them. They are just bland faces. I'd rather have Wheezy, Etch-A-Skeetch, the little blue robot, RC Car, the small plastic snake, and LASTLY BO PEEP....Getting rid of Bo Peep was dumb. She was a pretty big secondary character right next to Ham, Rex, and Mr. Potato Head. Also, Hugs a Lot is a complete Jerk...in every sense of the word. He doesn't even bring across that ""love to hate them"" type feeling, like ""Darth Vader"" or other really cool bad guys. He's just extremely mean and down-right nasty, especially considering what he did at the end of this film. I hated having him in this movie!Which brings me to next point, without interesting characters, the clever banter and humor between toys was missing in this one. No funny one liners or jokes that adults would only get. Just BLAH. Oh sure, the story had a plot and it unfolded decently, and the characters said enough, but I was looking for it to be fun along the way as well.Another thing is, the childhood innocence Andy had while playing with his toys in the first two movies is missing. Instead, Andy is grown up and we have his replacement Bonnie, whom I just didn't like. She seemed goofy...and I hate to say that about a child character, but I just didn't care for her at all. When she was playing with the toys it made me feel weird, awkard, and uncomfortable.Which brings me to my last reason for not really liking this movie, the ending. I wanted Andy to go put his toys in the attic, and then the toys live on together and are happy. One day down the road, Andy would be going through the Attic, come upon his old toys, pull them out, and fall in love all over again. He might have even tracked down another Etch a Sketch, Bo Peep doll, or RC car that he keeps at his own house for his kids or because he regretted giving them away.  BUT...I didn't get that sense of closure. So give me something else worthwhile!Pixar and Disney said, ""NO!"" So what happens is Andy is going to put his toys in the Attic, but Woody puts a post it note on the box to please donate the toys. So Andy takes them Bonnie's house and they play with the toys together. Now I think this part of the movie was really botched...We could have seen Andy playing with his toys again FOR OLD TIMES SAKE, possibly in slow motion and accompanied to some slow and mellow music. Maybe we could have seen some flashbacks to when he played with them before, when he was younger. You know something to really makes us feel sad about the loss of childhood innocence that has taken place? But instead, Andy plays with the toys as if he doesn't really care, no real emotion what so ever. Like it's no big deal.Then he goes back to his car, and gets in. He's looking at his toys for a long time with a VERY sad look in his face because he's leaving behind toys he still wants. I kept saying to myself,"" Go back for them then if you are going to miss them!!!"" But Andy just drives off, the toys stand on Bonnie's front porch, and the camera pans upward toward the sky...THAT'S MY SENSE OF CLOSURE?!?Then random clips of the toys enjoying their new life comes out and we some of the humor that was so lacking in the film. In my opinion, this movie's ending was horrible. What Pixar should have done is added all the credit scenes of the toys enjoying their new life to the end of the film, and made that the end. You know, a sense of closure that the toys were going to be all right. Maybe have ""You've got a friend in me"" playing to the montage to let us know things are back the way they used to be and the toys are enjoying themselves again.But instead, this movie's end feels like a set up for a new movie...I sense Toy Story is going to head the way of A LOT of Disney movies and go down the path of not as appealing, quick cash in, Direct to Video sequels. Toy Story 3 was ALMOST a direct to video movie...So I wouldn't be surprised at all if this happened! So forget about me getting that sense of closure I was talking about earlier, instead I got a way for Disny and Pixar to dig the franchise up and bring it back to life whenever they want to! Life Lesson 101: Sometimes it's good when something good ends before it has the chance of going on for too long and becoming stale.I did however, like the idea of Mrs. Potato Head using her missing eye to see Andy, and how Mr. Potato head transferred himself to a wrap for a taco...but did anyone else think he looked like the Mr. Potato head parody character on Mad Tv's old spoof of Toy Story? Coincidence?Also, I did like the part near the end where the toys were going to get melted. They did that well,and it really had me worried and brought out some emotion in me. Thus, making me care. Thus, making me like that scene.Overall, I liked this movie. But it can't hold a candle to the first toy released years ago. However, I'd still recommend seeing it at least once, or buying a copy when it released.",3,"Okay, I know I am going to be hated for this, but I have to say it...",1277337600,"06 24,

1253587,A2172P0XZDC8L3,B00275EHJG,"Thomas A. Zulli ""Tazz""","[3, 4]","Its finally here, the third installment to the ground breaking animated film. We all remember watching the first Toy Story when we were younger. Now we are much older and some even have kids who are just watching the series for the first time.First off, the story is perfect. Andy is all grown up and going to college (we all have grown up) and the toys dont know what their fate is whether its the attic, garbage or donation. After a mixup, Woody, Buzz and the rest of the game find themselves in a strange and unknown territory...daycare. There they think they found their belonging. A place where they never get old as when kids grow up..new kids come. But soon they find out things arent what they seen.For a kids movie, this can be considered scary with intense scenes that might scare some kids. Also at times, you have a tear in your eyes as the movie has its sad scenes.Almost of the major actors return with the exception of Jim Varney (Slinky Dog) who died shortly after the 2nd movie.

I really like how Lotso is cute and huggable on the outside, but pure evil on the inside. Also the knowledge that the toys in the Caterpillar Room get broken then thrown away in the garbage is horrifying.

1253597,AMF52GSX309V0,B00275EHJG,Tony S.,"[3, 4]","If you're a Toy Story fan at all, if you're a MOVIE fan at all, skip this review and go see Toy Story 3 immediately. Yes, it's good, it's really really good. I have a lot of ""likes"" on this one, so I want to get started already.What I liked about the movie:StoryHere's a little known fact about Toy Story 3, the story took 2 and a half years to perfect. And perfect is the correct word to use. I never talk plot in my reviews, I'm not going to start now. But I will say the trailer gives you a general idea as to what happens to the toys. But overall, the story is terrific. There is a solid beginning, middle and end. The end of this movie is very fitting to arguably one of the best trilogies in history, animated or not. I Tweeted after I left the theater, that the world would be a better place if Pixar wrote every movie in Hollywood. Online petition anyone?The CharactersWe all know them, we all love them, and they're all back. Woody, Buzz, Jesse, Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head, Rex, and more, are all in top form in this one. The voice acting is superb, as it has been throughout the trilogy. All the big names are back, i.e. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack. New comer Michael Keaton is awesome as the annoying, yet hilarious, Ken. Ned Betty plays one of the new major characters, Lotso the bear, also perfectly cast. Not everyone gets their fair share of screen time, but I felt that I got enough of all the major characters after an 11 year break from the previous Toy Story film. Great Job in this department.The AnimationThe animation just keeps getting better and better from Pixar. In our second installment of ""You know what's a good movie?"" we showcased the first Toy Story. And in that article I talked about how Pixar's techniques have improved with every movie they've released. TS3 is no exception. There are so many details that it's impossible to appreciate them all with just one viewing. I can't wait to see the movie again just to catch more that I may have missed the first time.The ActionThe action in TS3 is phenomenal. There are new things we've never seen in the previous 2 films. There's a planned escape scene that has so much to it, only Pixar could have kept track and executed it as well as they did. No spoiler here, but the last half hour of the movie involves a lot of action that was awesome. Again, it's only because the animators have gotten so good at what they do, that the action is this good.The ThemesThere haven't been too many movies that will tug at your emotional strings like this one will. In fact, I'll say this is the best movie of the year so far. There are several themes expressed throughout the movie. A child's coming of age. There is a fantastic scene in the movie where Andy is saying bye to his old room before he heads off to college. It's just Andy comforting his mom before he leaves, but it stays true to anyone who has experienced that situation. The emotion projected through the characters is nothing short of amazing.MINOR SPOILER ALERT, not really giving anything away though:Friendship is the other theme. Woody and Buzz' friendship. The friendship between Andy and Woody. The most talked about/ most Tweeted about/ most written about scene, will definitely have you in tears. I'm a man close to 30 years old. I haven't cried since the day of my wedding more than two years ago, and was crying like a high school girl on the night of a breakup. I can't express this enough, it comes down to Pixar's mastering of the art form. Without their amazing animators, none of the emotion would have came out of that particular scene where there is literally no dialogue, just emotion channeled through the characters.END SPOILER ALERT.The EndingSome trilogies leave you disappointed, and this movie did not do that. Everything is wrapped up very nicely. Every problem resolved and we, as the audience leave the theater very satisfied with the toy's fates. There is a great scene with Andy and Woody that will stay with me for a long time. Amazing.What I didn't like about the movie:RehashI bet when you started reading this review, you didn't expect any negative feedback did you? Well 2 things, same category of negative. The first, too many plot points were similar in one way or another to Toy Story 2. I was reading this online before the movie came out and just sort of ignored it. But it's very obvious. By no means did it take away from experience though. In fact, I think they improved on all the material I felt they rehashed. Second was the latin Buzz, shown in multiple versions of the trailer. It worked, trust me, it's funny. But again, rehash. I can't really explain in detail about the Buzz scene without giving something away, so let me know what you think after you see the movie.In conclusion, the movie is spectacular. I can't really do the movie justice with my review. The movie is so good on so many levels, to write about it in a blog format is not fair. Pixar is the best in the world at what they do, period. They knew to deliver this caliber a movie, it was going to take a long time. Like I said earlier, over 2 years writing and story boarding the movie. And it paid off. Unlike the rubbish that DreamWorks is banging out with their Shrek sequels, TS3 progressed the story and the characters.One thing is for sure, I am going to miss these little computer generated toys a lot more than I thought I would before seeing the movie. To Disney, Pixar, the cast and crew... thank you for one of the BEST trilogies in movie history.",5,"""Toy Story 3"" Review",1283558400,"09 4, 2010",2010,5514,"[""'re"", 'Toy', 'Story', 'fan',

Look what happened after the great one-two punch of ""Godfather"" and ""Godfather II,"" or ""Alien"" and ""Aliens""? So when I heard Pixar was making ""Toy Story 3,"" I was naturally skeptical. After 11 years since ""Toy Story 2""?OK, I admit. I was wrong. As many people say, ""Pixar can do no wrong."" I am not actually sure about that (as the last year's ""Up"" was something of a disappointment), but as far as the ""Toy Story"" franchise is concerned, it is true. People at Pixar will not be likely to fail in living up with our expectations.Andy has grown up. As he is leaving home for college, and his sister is moving into his room, there is no reason for his toys to remain there. After some misunderstandings and confusions, Woody, Buzz, Jessie and other lovable toys find themselves in Sunnyside Daycare center, where Lotso, the bear with a strawberry scent politely welcome them. Maybe too politely.""Toy Story 3"" is a rip-roaring ""Great Escape""-type adventure film with lots of funny moments, providing many rousing action sequences interspersed with comic relief, but there is also a darker aspect to the deceptively simple story, which will make you think, for instance: What happened to Wheezy the Penguin and Andy's other toys? What happened to yours? Where are they now? We are touched by the characters and their struggle to survive because we know exactly that in reality most of them cannot escape the inevitable (an attic or a garbage truck, as the film suggests).That's why the ending is very important. Some viewers may be surprised at the finale which I am sure will make you cry, but this is also a clever way to conclude the story that started 15 years ago.

1253602,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B00275EHJG,Turfseer,"[8, 23]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***I was looking forward to seeing Toy Story 3 since I enjoyed Toy Story 1 & 2 so much. The question remains whether Toy Story 3 measures up to its predecessors. All the main characters are back including Woody and Buzz Lightyear and the Pixar animation, with its attention to extreme detail, is even better. It was a good idea not to bring back all the toys from the previous features and dispensing with the toy soldiers (for example), by having them 'bail out', was quite clever.The plot begins in the present, with the toy's owner, Andy, now about to go away to college. He packs up his toys (excluding Woody who he intends to take with him to college) and puts them in a bag, about to bring them upstairs to the attic for storage. Somehow he gets distracted and his mother mistakenly throws the bag with the toys out in the trash. The toys manage to escape from the bag but jump into a box marked for the Sunnyside Day Care Center. Woody manages to follow the toys to the day care center and insists they should all return to Andy before he goes away to college. The toys, however, don't relish the idea of being no use up in the attic and stage a mutiny. Woody leaves his colleagues, only to end up in the home of Bonnie, a young child, who has some neat, new toys including a Shakespearean hedgehog, Mr. Pricklepants, and a scatterbrained triceratops, Trixie.Unlike Toy Story 1 & 2, which featured human antagonists (the vicious child 'Sid' in ""1"" and Al McWhiggin, the conniving toy store owner in ""2""), Toy Story 3's antagonist is Lotso, a bear with a chip on his shoulder. It seems that Lotso was lost by his previous owner, a child named Daisy, who replaced him with a similar looking model. Somehow the idea that the innocent toy world can be corrupted by an evil seed within its own ranks isn't as effective as having human antagonists. That's because I think it's better to depict the toys as essentially representing the innocent and positive world of childhood with the negative force derived from the worst aspects of adulthood. In Toy Story 1, Sid is a child, obviously conditioned to be a 'monster' by his parents; and in Toy Story 2, Al the toy store owner, embodies the sin of avarice, which must be opposed through the 'goodness' of Andy's toys. In a sense, 'toydom' is diminished by pitting toy against toy and the point that adults are responsible for causing the problems of childhood, is lost.The other problem I found with the plot is that Andys' toys' reaction to Lotso's directives was unfounded. You'll recall that Andys' toys claim that being placed with the 'younger children' is inappropriate; but as toys, they should expect to be thrown around by younger children (isn't that what younger children do with toys?). And was Lotso being so unfair when he demands that the new toys be placed with the younger one's first, since they're ""first in line""? Notice at the end of the film, when 'fairness' is supposedly restored, Ken and Barbie are now running the day care center, now allowing all the toys to take turns, interacting with the younger and more disruptive children. Note that the toys will still be subjected to being thrown around by the younger children--simply less often.Still, Toy Story 3 is filled with thrilling scenes, reminiscent of its predecessors. After Andy's toys attempt to escape from the day care center, we're taken on a wild ride inside a trash compactor. The toys face their 'dark moment of the soul' as they're about to be burnt alive in an incinerator; after Lotso fails to save them by pushing the compactor's stop button, they're miraculously saved by squeeze toy aliens who somehow manage to stop all power by operating the controls in the control room.There are other neat scenes in Toy Story 3 including Buzz turning into a Lothario after accidentally being set on 'Spanish mode', Barbie and Ken falling in, then out of love and back in love again, Ken's hilarious wardrobe display and the fantastic introductory sequence featuring a wild chase involving both a train and a spaceship.For those who haven't seen Toy Story 1 & 2, Toy Story 3 might seem like a masterpiece. But for those who have seen the two earlier incarnations, one can only conclude that ""3"" just isn't quite as good. ""3"" does get marks for trying however. The theme that one cannot hold on to the past is ably embodied in Woody's resistance to leaving Andy and finally accepting, along with the rest of Andy's toys, the idea that it's time to move on. On the other hand, it's sad to see Lotso, pinned to the front of a garbage truck, with the implication that he may be the victim of his new owner, who might be some kind of sadist or pervert. The image of an innocent child's toy, made to represent some demonic force, is all wrong and sadly makes Story 3 inappropriate for younger viewers.",3,"Entertaining, but not as good as Toy Story 1 &

1253603,A2OCJNB6B46OKP,B00275EHJG,"Underground Reborn ""gnome""","[1, 2]","First and foremost if you are actually reading this and you haven't seen it, get up off your ass and go to the theater right now! I know it is still playing in a theater somewhere!It has been 11 years since we have seen these characters and I will say when I heard about a script in the works for the third chapter I was a bit skeptical for many reasons. Apparently this movie started out as a direct to DVD release when first conceptualized about...4/5 years ago. It was not going to be in CGI and the plot was about Woody and the gang rescuing Buzz from Japan after he and other first edition Buzz Lightyear figures were recalled to the manufacture. Yea, that could have worked, but this is Toy Story! I mean when we all went to see this movie about 15 years ago we were just awestruck by these unbelievable characters. The movie was full of such magic and the story was so original that is just made you think about your own Toys and how great they felt when you played with them. I know I am going on and on, but that just shows you how meaningful Toy Story is to me and film as a whole.Toy Story 3, does not meet up to the grandeur of its predecessors. Toy Story 3 goes above and beyond anything that this story has given us so far. Toy Story 3 turns this simple little world into a massive epic, and the story itself while it may be so simple and easy to follow, there are just so many different emotional levels seen throughout. There are points in the movie where you will laugh so hard and then in the following scene you will be trying so hard to hold back tears. In the theater I was in, I saw grown men cry. For that to happen because of a movie, it just shows you there is something truly special here. The Pixar animation has come so far since Toy Story, that the textures and scenery that you see in this installment are so believable and lifelike you can almost touch them yourself. The voice acting is fantastic as well. Along with the story, the cast returns and steps up their game as well. Each character is given so much more depth and the funnier members of the bunch get even funnier. On top of that we are introduced a whole new batch of toys. Each one is unique in its own way and the new actors that lent their voices did a wonderful job, it was as almost as if there were there from the start. There are not many jokes that play on satire or pop culture like Shrek, but the humor that is used just works. The movie is great for all ages, but I believe it was really made for those that have been there from the beginning. You can tell by some of the scenes that it is not only because you have known these characters growing up, but it is the fact that you are now seeing these characters as a grown up and how you must have felt when you realized it was time to stop playing with your own toys and if they were like these characters what they must be feeling. On that note, probably the best part of this film would have to be the ending. I don't think I have seen a story end on such a high note since 'Return of the King' It just makes you feel so many different kinds of wonderful emotions. The feelings that you leave with towards these characters, in fact the entire legacy that Toy Story has become, you could not have asked for a more proper send off.Now, after reading this I sure hope that if you haven't seen Toy Story 3 that you will. Brush up on your Toy Story and Toy Story 2, because when you see Toy Story 3 you will be very glad you did. Pixar really has outdone them selves with this film. As a person who has seen almost every Disney animated film and who owns every Pixar film, Toy Story 3 could arguably be the greatest Disney animated film ever made! This movie has been praised by fans and critics everywhere since its theatrical release. It makes me wonder where the Pixar gang will go with future projects, some of which will be sequels to other Pixar classics. In fact I don't think 2010 can possibly give us anything better in film! I have already seen Inception and I have to say that Toy Story just adds that little bit of extra magic. Toy Story 3 to me at this point is the best film of 2010, it has surpassed The Incredibles as my all time favorite Pixar film. I sure hope that this film wins the Oscar for Best Picture of the year, yea I am going to stick to that last statment because a film like Toy Story 3 is why we go to see movies and purchase them in the first place. Not only do we want to be entertained, or just escape the hardships of every day life, in the end what we truly want from the films is that sense of perfection that goes deep within our souls. While that feeling maybe different for everyone if you find that feeling it just sets everything right in the world. Like Peter Jackson, John Lassater deserves his credit that has been due to him ever since he created Toy Story. To get an award as prestigious as the Oscar for best film will show the world that animation can be just as real as live action and if you just have the desire and the passion to create something special that is not depicted by something that is entirely real, you can sure as hell do the best that you can to make it real.BUY THIS MOVIE!!!",5,Quite possibly the best Disney Animated

How people grow up and lose their beloved childhood toys, give them up to other children in need, or even yes, throw some of them out. We've all been there.In this movie, Andy has grown up and moves on to go to college. An outcome any parent in their right mind would be proud of. With this milestone in Andy's life he has to make some sacrifices. As do every person entering the adult world has to.The toys also have to make some sacrifices and adapt to their human owner's life. As mentioned in Toy Story 2 (there were plenty of precursors to Toy Story 3), they couldn't stop Andy from growing up. No one can stop the wheels of time.Now, think about when people donate items to the Goodwill. Your unused items are useful to someone somewhere. Someone you know or don't know may be able to use them.It's really surprises me that so many one star reviewers are upset that Andy gave the toys to some ""random"" girl.Life isn't always friendly and movies aren't either. Disney is no exception. They're family movies so they have aspects for all ages.

In part one, it was the new toy (Buzz) challenging the viability of the old one (Woody).  Part two is more of an origins tale.  The trend continues in part three, this time dealing with the growing-up of toy owner Andy.For a basic plot summary, Toy Story 3 sees the toybox gang (led as usual by Woody the Cowboy and Buzz the Space Ranger) trying to deal with Andy going away to college.  When some of the toys panic in thinking they will end up in the city refuse, they ""escape"" to a local daycare, where life seems to be fine.  However, the idyllic daycare future (where toys always get played with) may not be as rosy as it seems, forcing the toys to make some tough decisions about returning to Andy or moving on with their lives.All the good stuff that made the franchise what it is today is present in this film: the strong lead characters, the wise-cracking ""peanut gallery"" of supporting characters, and the hilarious sight gags that will thrill both young and old.  Also, the animation is slicker than ever (compare technology from the mid-90s to today and you'll get the picture), bringing the characters and their rich environments to live in even more vivid clarity.However, what really sets this film apart from other Pixar fare is its attention to themes that tug at everyone's heartstrings.  The toys struggle with their loyalty to Andy (who has inevitably outgrown them) vs. their desire to still be played with (every toy's greatest joy).  At times, you might wonder just why exactly you are misting end (especially towards the end) about chunks of plastic animated onscreen, but then you'll remember: Because they DO mean something to you, as they share the same struggles as normal people.  Unlike perhaps any other children's film franchise in history, Toy Story really creates an unbreakable emotional bond between ""actors"" and audience.If this is indeed the final chapter in the Toy Story saga (and the ending, while emotional, leaves some wiggle room for the future), it went out on the highest of possible notes.
