Even though their characters practically hate each other at the beginning, out of necessity, they stick together and eventually try to make their marriage work again.  The only drawback is some strong language, but otherwise the older kids could watch this with you.",5,Love this movie!,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,375,"['Tim', 'Allen', 'still', 'funny', 'Kirstie', 'Alley', 'still', 'beautiful', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'heyday', 'Even', 'characters', 'practically', 'hate', 'other', 'beginning', 'necessity', 'stick', 'together', 'eventually', 'try', 'make', 'marriage', 'work', 'again', 'only', 'drawback', 'strong', 'language', 'otherwise', 'older', 'kids', 'could', 'watch']",N/A

Tim Allen's ultra rich character finds himself in trouble with the IRS after his swindling accountant (Seinfeld's Wayne Knight) embezzles millions from his company.  Allen and wife Kirstie Alley find themselves on the run.  They end up stranded together in an Amish town.  To hide, the two pretend to be Amish.  This leads to many funny situations.  They learn some lessons from the Amish and mend their rocky marriage.
