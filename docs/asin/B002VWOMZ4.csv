1296131,A23KZBVCFKW1XS,B002VWOMZ4,A_Plain_Janeite,"[44, 45]","What else can I say, but that I absolutely love this BBC period drama series!!  (I'm must admit that I'm an avid admirer of most period/historical/costume dramas; and who else makes them better but the BBC?!)I started watching this series during the time the 1st season was airing in the UK. I fell in love with the characters, beautiful backdrop, and quaint country life of long ago.  I couldn't wait to share this lovely series with my family, so I ended up pre-ordering the 1st season off of Amazon UK.  I also ended up doing the same for season 2- not knowing if or when it would come to the states.  Thankfully,  PBS has since included this gem of a show on it's lineup!  ..I'm just wondering if we'll have to wait as long for season 3 to air, as we did for the last two.  In fact, it wasn't until season 2 had ended in the UK, that they finally started showing season 1.  ..Better late than never I guess =o)Anyway, you might recognize some of the shows main characters.  As was noted by another reviewer; Dorcas Lane is played by none other than Julia Sawalha, who is quite the period drama veteran (most recently she also had a starring role in ""Cranford""- another favorite of mine)!!  Then there's Brendan Coyle (Robert Timmins) whom you might remember as Nicholas Higgins in Elizabeth Gaskell's ""North & South"" (BBC).  Laura's mother Emma, is played by Claudie Blakley, who was Charlotte Lucas in the '05 ""Pride & Prejudice"", and maid Martha in ""Cranford"".Now to my review..  (I watched all but the first episode.)  Although a few of the characters from the first season are missing (notably ""Sir Timothy""), and some new ones introduced- it seems to flow well, and compliment the 1st season nicely.I adore Thomas Brown and Miss Ellison; they are quite the pair!  I'm very  glad that we're able to watch their relationship blossom and come to fruition in this new season!One of the new characters- Minnie the maid (played by Ruby Bentall; who also appears in ""The Courageous Heart of Irena Sendler"", and ""Lost in Austen"")- takes some getting used to though.  Even through all her childish mistakes, you can see the character learn and grow; and by the end of the season, she is likeable.I think perhaps my favorite new character (unfortunately only a guest-star for 3 episodes), was Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty; who appears in the ""Return to Cranford"" special).  You couldn't help but be smitten with him-- right along with Laura.  This is her first taste of love; and as most ""first loves"" go, they don't last as long as one might hope (but still leave a lasting impression nonetheless).  ..I'm rooting for a reappearance of him in the 3'd season, but I don't see anything mentioned on his IMDB page.I was also glad to see that Alf (John Dagleish.. a dead ringer for a young Sylvester Stallone) was able to come into his own in this season; and develop feelings for someone other than Laura (even if the girl wasn't that deserving).  And through it all he continues to be the pillar of strength, and competent provider for his younger siblings- just as he was in the 1st season!Finally, who can forget the Turrill's?!  You can't help but laugh and shake your head at the funny things Twister does, and commiserate at times with Queenie.  They're a bit of an odd couple; but they make it work--most comically!  (And you'll find out a little revelation regarding their relationship in this season.)As I mentioned earlier, there is a season 3 (so breathe a sigh of relief).  The first episode aired Jan. 10th in the UK!  ..If the season is as long as season 2 (12 ep's), then it should be available for pre-order this spring (April or May) on Amazon.uk!!  Meanwhile I'll be feverishly checking the IMDB page, and the PBS listings (once season 2 is finished replaying; it's about half over at the moment) to see when it will air in the US!  If not, I can always order it off of Amazon UK again.  If you plan on ordering from the UK, just be sure your dvd player is Region free, or PAL (region 2) compatible.  I have an inexpensive GPX dvd player (# D1816SIL) that I purchased 3 years ago, and they play fine!My only complaint about the series, is that it doesn't have longer seasons (season 1 had only ten, and season 2- twelve episodes).  It seems like you're waiting forever (about a year) for the next season!  But I guess that can't be helped.  ..Let's just hope that there will be a season 4!!Oh, if you're looking for something a bit comparable from the US, please check out ""Christy"" (a short lived series starring Kelly Martin and Tyne Daly), or ""Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman"" (Jane Seymour, & Joe Lando).  Or the ""Road To Avonlea"" series from Canada!",5,LRtC: A Wonderful Series..

During season 1 we got to know the characters that live in the out village of Lark Rise, as well as the prominent citizens of the larger market town, Candleford.  The setting stays the same in season 2, where we get to follow the lives of our friends from season 1 as they continue to toil and make their way in rural 1895 England.This is outstanding family entertainment, with something for everyone, though it will probably not hold the attention of the children in grades 1-3 or so in elementary school.  It, frankly, doesn't sell too well with my HS son either.  Regardless, this is a great series, and if you haven't yet tried it, I heartily encourage you to do so.This show is entirely watchable.  There has been nothing in the first two seasons that I have been hesistant about either my 11-year old daughter or mother-in-law seeing.  Get the picture?  Though I have to admit that episode 1 in season 2 was a bit freaky, with everyone seeing the ghost(?) of a girl, and then trying to figure out what that means.  Anyway, the people were still clearly largely superstitious, and comes across here and there.The stories are engaging, and the acting is top-notch.

Also, a business owner is found to have had a &#34;past&#34;, and another business owner is tempted into an affair that is rejected finally because of the threat of being found out.

One episode had a ghost, that once was given a proper burial, was &#34;released&#34; to finally go home to eternal rest.  Another episode had the villagers believing that a tree was bleeding human blood because a woman had died and had become the tree - and the only way to &#34;release&#34; her was to perform some ritual consisting of herbs and chants.  And appearing throughout the show, Queenie, an older village woman of Lark Rise, reads tea leaves and accurately predicts the future.  And the Christians, when they react negatively to all this are laughed at or at best treated like they are overreacting.  Conclusion?.......it is respectable to believe that dead people turn into trees and tea leaves know the future, but to believe wholeheartedly that the Bible is God's sacred and inerrant word and is to be obeyed, is foolishness.

1296156,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,B002VWOMZ4,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","A second set of 11 episodes (plus a Christmas special) from the BBC's delightful drama series LARK RISE TO CANDLEFORD, based on the autobiographical writings of Flora Thompson.  Quality is pretty much on par with Series 1, but whereas many episodes from the first series had self-contained storylines, the plots in Series 2 tend to continue on; and while most would do this anyway, it's preferable to watch these episodes in numeric order.  As before, the writing is very strong, with lots of depth and nuance injected into the established characters, and some fantastic new faces thrown in the mix.The four-DVD set kicks off with a special 75-minute Christmas episode, in which the residents of Lark Rise and Candleford are troubled by the presence of a barefoot young woman, with a ragged dressing-gown her only protection from the bitter chill.  The girl stirs up strong feelings from the people whom she meets, including Ruby Pratt (Victoria Hamilton), who finds the courage to stand up to her domineering sister Pearl (Matilda Ziegler); and Caroline (Dawn French), who fears that her husband is preparing to return to the sea.  Laura finds her loyalties torn when she is expected to go back to her family in Lark Rise for Christmas, leaving Dorcas (Julia Sawalha) to spend the festivities alone.Series 2 officially kicks off with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former orphan from Lark Rise who has returned to open the Golden Lion Hotel in Candleford - and to no doubt also help usher in a new era of change.  Dorcas and James strike up a competitive relationship as they vie for a position on the local council.  Meanwhile, headaches at the post office are caused by Dorcas' new maid Minnie (Ruby Bentall), a young girl whose flippant attitude to performing her work is matched only by her foolhardy personality - but who also carries a terrifying secret.Laura is intrigued by Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty), a clockmaker who has been engaged by James to create a clock tower for Candleford, whilst postman Thomas Brown (Mark Heap) woos Margaret Ellison (Sandy McDade) in his own hilarious fashion.  After taking over the care of the latest Timmins baby for a few weeks in order to give exhausted Emma (Claudie Blakley) a small respite from her duties, Dorcas and Ruby both ponder their futures as childless spinsters.  A cruel reversal of fortunes in the Timmins household later threatens to split the family apart altogether when Robert (Brendan Coyle) considers leaving the district to find work.When Dorcas falls ill with a severe 'flu, it's left to Laura to keep the post office running as smoothly as ever, but with a sleepwalking Thomas and a sudden string of abusive, taunting letters addressed to ""The Girl at the Post Office"", Laura's new position of authority doesn't come without it's obstacles.  Long-simmering tensions between Lark Rise and its neighbouring hamlet Fordlow run riot when Alf (John Dagleish) starts courting Nan Carter (Rebecca Night).

1296168,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B002VWOMZ4,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","Season one was fantastic.  And season two is also wonderful.  We do get an odd Dickens-like Christmas ghost story to start the season off with (it was a special episode according to what I read on IMDB).  But starting with the second episode, we get to continue the magical story telling that we've come to enjoy from this series.Season two really focuses on individual character stories.  Whereas season one had the incidents or happenings that affected the entire town (Lark Rise or Candleford or both), season two seems to focus on the back story or interactions between one or two characters or families at a time.Alfie has definitely changed, he is not as whiny as he was in season one.  Instead he is portrayed as a coming of age young man who develops a friendship with several of the older men, mainly Twister.  We do focus heavily on Ms. Lane and the post office, though Laura is not as prominent a featured character.  Instead she is more of the eyewitness to events and her character functions well as a narrator in this regard.  Other characters are wonderfully portrayed, and it is with great delight that we view these characters grow and become fond of them.There are a few characters that do not return from season one for various reasons.  Though I do miss them, the new additions are very welcome.  The gentleman that owns the new hotel is a particularly complex and enjoyable character to watch.  Robert and his family do also feature quite a bit as well.My question is: what the heck happened to Caroline Arless?  Last I saw she was home with the hubby, next thing she's gone and nobody mentions why!  The other characters that are not returning had story arcs that ended with the viewers knowing what happened to them. (Answered in comments - they left to build a house, though in season 3 we find out something else about Caroline's... predicament)But I think that season two really builds upon the greatness of season one and exceeds it in several cases.  Just power through the haunted episode (which is just for fun) and get to the real heart of season two.  Whether Lark Rise is coming together to pave a road or the towns turning out for a hotel opening or parish election; the close knit ties that bind these people together are woven into a wonderful viewing experience.  Never are the story arcs too 'dramatic' or involve occurnaces that would have been out of place for the time.  This is not a world of villains and sneaks and affairs.  This is a world of normal people trying to make their way in rural England in the late 1800s.  A world where the arrival of a bicycle causes a ruckus.  A world where a woman running for a county office is unheard of.  A world where just paying the rent or finding time to read a book can be a trial.  It's wonderful television.

All of this is to the delight of the viewer of this masterfully done TV series sure to endear any North American who has a tender video heart toward Victorian Britain.

I'm also an avid reader and though I'm not &#34;old,&#34; I love Masterpiece Theater and the older BBC shows like Midsomer Murders that have quality story lines minus all the graphic carnage.  I love series like Sherlock Holmes, Luther, Downton Abbey, and Whitechapel (which can be a bit graphic but it's definitely for the &#34;thinking&#34; person).  Something about the Brits; they can make quality television for intelligent people that many US networks cannot seem to do (with the exception of The Killing, most American shows are just over the top, and mindless, with an attitude of, &#34;how much can I shock you or put graphic gore or sex into each new episode?&#34;).  Graphic gore and sex does not make for a quality show; good writing and acting does.  If you love Dickens, Austen, and other British authors, you will love Lark Rise to Candleford. Or, if you just like good-hearted, positive stories that make you feel better about yourself and life in general, you'll appreciate the show. The characters are endearing and each episode actually helps you put faith back into humanity (does American Horror Story do that, or, does it do just the opposite?)

I actually flinched in some parts as reality seemed too harsh to be bearable, yet the joys and triumphs only prove that,yes, is as it was supposed to be.  It is an absolute masterpiece of how stories should be filmed and told...brought to us by a skillful and loving group of actors, writer, directors and producers who must feel and love their accomplishment with this as we feel and love their films..Thank you for such love everyone...",5,this is so real and so inspiring.

The characters were quirky but pulled together to help each other when needed. They weren't perfect but they dealt with their problems. It is not a high society English drama. These are working people. There are two communities. One is rural with people that work the land. The other community was a small town.

The ""Christmas Special"" episode could become as essential an annual viewing as Dickens' ""Christmas Carol."" or ""The Snowman."" It is a complete story in itself and does not have its genesis in earlier episodes and does not carry the story forward in subsequent ones. So watching this episode is satisfying in that it has a beginning, a middle and an end. You can then move on to the continuing story from the events in the first season. The new maid, Minnie (Ruby Bentall) may strike you as a bit too muddled and accident prone to be true in the early episodes, but her back story emerges gradually through the series and she develops into an interesting character, and we learn why Dorcas employed her rather any one of a hundred less problematic girls available to her. Twister is revealed as not just a comical figure but that he has a mean streak in him at times. Laura will melt the hardest heart, and I defy anyone not to weep at what I consider is her strongest scene in the whole series, and that is from an actress who shines in every scene in which she appears.

Though I have the DVDs, I am now watching the series via Amazon Instant Video (Prime members get to watch it for free), and love it!Season One of Lark Rise to Candleford tackles myriad themes, and is adapted from Flora Thompson's semi-autobiographical novel. In the first season, young Laura Timmins (Olivis Hallinan) leaves her village of Lark Rise to work as an assistant to the postmistress in Candleford, Dorcas Lane (Julia Sawalha who was also brilliant in her role as Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)). Through the course of the first season, Laura discovers that she enjoys living in the more affluent town of Candleford, and experiences the pangs of adolescence, including romantic entanglements. Dorcas Lane, the kind-hearted and sensible postmistress also goes through some pangs of her own, largely to do with her friendship with squire, Sir Timothy Midwinter (Ben Miles) who is married to the beautiful and composed Lady Adelaide (Olivia Grant). In the first season, viewers got to see the themes of marital strife, conflicts between the upper and lower classes, romantic entanglements, and other issues played out.By the second season, both Sir Timothy and Lady Adelaide have moved to London, but there is still plenty of drama in Dorcas' life with the arrival of James Dowland (Jason Merrells), a former inhabitant of Lark Rise, a local boy who has done well in life. Being a self-made and wealthy man, James settles in Candleford, though he reacquaints himself with the residents of Lark Rise, especially Queenie Turrill (Linda Bassett) who used to take care of him as a young boy. James opens a fashionable hotel in Candleford, and tries to 'improve' the lives of the Lark Rise residents with mixed results. There is also a strong chemistry between James and Dorcas, though their relationship flounders between attraction and rivalry/conflict. Laura seems more mature and wiser, having learned a couple of enlightening things about the pitfalls of romance, and is taking on more responsibilities at the post office. But then, a young clockmaker, Fisher Bloom (Matthew McNulty) comes to town, and Laura finds herself attracted to Fisher, though he seems oblivious to her charms, initially. Laura's parents, Robert and Emma Timmins (Brendan Coyle & Claudie Blakley) who have always been a very close and loving couple find themselves facing some marital strife in their marriage, and this second season takes an intimate look at their dynamics as a couple.There is also plenty of drama amongst the other inhabitants of Lark Rise & Candleford - the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt (Matilda Ziegler, Victoria Hamilton) who have a dressmaking/drapery store continue to pry into others' affairs whilst dealing with their own emotional dramas. Postman Thomas Brown's (Mark Heap)romantic (mis)adventures continue, and many more. This is truly a gem of a series, and I am hopelessly addicted to it. Each episode is well-crafted and credibly acted, drawing viewers into the lives of these mostly endearing & flawed characters, and making one feel at home in both Lark Rise and Candleford.",5,This show is very addictive!,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",2012,3237,"['love', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'have', 'been', 'watching', 'series', 'last', 'several', 'years', 'have', 'DVDs', 'am', 'now', 'watching', 'series', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'Prime', 'members', 'get', 'watch', 'free', 'love', 'Season', 'One', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'myriad', 'themes', 'adapted', 'Flora', 'Thompson', 'semi-autobiographical', 'novel', 'first', 'season', 'young', 'Laura', 'Timmins', 'Olivis', 'Hallinan', 'village', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'work', 'assistant', 'postmistress', 'Candleford', 'Dorcas', 'Lane', 'Julia', 'Sawalha', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'brilliant', 'role', 'Lydia', 'Bennet', 'Pride', 'Prejudice', 'Special', 'Edition', 'A', 'E', '1996', 'course', 'first', 'season', 'Laura', 'living', 'more', 'affluent', 'town', 'Candleford', 'pangs', 'adolescence', 'including', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'Dorcas', 'Lane', 'kind-hearted', 'sensible', 'postmistress', 'also', 'pangs', 'own', 'largely', 'do', 'friendship', 'squire', 'Sir', 'Timothy', 'Midwinter', 'Ben', 'Miles', 'who', 'married', 'beautiful', 'composed', 'Lady', 'Adelaide', 'Olivia', 'Grant', 'first', 'season', 'viewers', 'got', 'see', 'themes', 'marital', 'strife', 'conflicts', 'upper', 'lower', 'classes', 'romantic', 'entanglements', 'other', 'issues', 'played', 'out.By', 'second', 'season', 'Sir', 'Timothy', 'Lady', 'Adelaide', 'have', 'moved', 'London', 'still', 'plenty', 'drama', 'Dorcas', 'life', 'arrival', 'James', 'Dowland', 'Jason', 'Merrells', 'former', 'inhabitant', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'local', 'boy', 'who', 'done', 'well', 'life', 'Being', 'self-made', 'wealthy', 'man', 'James', 'Candleford', 'residents', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'especially', 'Queenie', 'Turrill', 'Linda', 'Bassett', 'who', 'used', 'take', 'care', 'young', 'boy', 'James', 'fashionable', 'hotel', 'Candleford', 'tries', ""'improve"", 'lives', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'residents', 'mixed', 'results', 'also', 'strong', 'chemistry', 'James', 'Dorcas', 'relationship', 'flounders', 'attraction', 'rivalry/conflict', 'Laura', 'more', 'mature', 'wiser', 'having', 'learned', 'couple', 'enlightening', 'things', 'pitfalls', 'romance', 'taking', 'more', 'responsibilities', 'post', 'office', 'then', 'young', 'clockmaker', 'Fisher', 'Bloom', 'Matthew', 'McNulty', 'town', 'Laura', 'attracted', 'Fisher', 'oblivious', 'charms', 'initially', 'Laura', 'parents', 'Robert', 'Emma', 'Timmins', 'Brendan', 'Coyle', 'Claudie', 'Blakley', 'who', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'very', 'close', 'loving', 'couple', 'find', 'facing', 'marital', 'strife', 'marriage', 'second', 'season', 'intimate', 'look', 'dynamics', 'couple.There', 'also', 'plenty', 'drama', 'amongst', 'other', 'inhabitants', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford', 'sisters', 'Pearl', 'Ruby', 'Pratt', 'Matilda', 'Ziegler', 'Victoria', 'Hamilton', 'who', 'have', 'dressmaking/drapery', 'store', 'continue', 'pry', 'others', 'affairs', 'dealing', 'own', 'emotional', 'dramas', 'Postman', 'Thomas', 'Brown', 'Mark', 'Heap', 'romantic', 'mis', 'continue', 'many', 'more', 'truly', 'gem', 'series', 'am', 'hopelessly', 'addicted', 'episode', 'well-crafted', 'credibly', 'acted', 'drawing', 'viewers', 'lives', 'mostly', 'endearing', 'flawed', 'characters', 'making', 'one', 'feel', 'home', 'Lark', 'Rise', 'Candleford']",Lark Rise to Candleford: Season 2
