All three discs have lots of options, which is good, but the other two are less to my personal taste.  I see from other comments that the instructor on the Weight Loss disc has a background in Iyengar yoga, and this is apparent, as the practice is very focussed on position and alignment and moves very slowly.  The Power Yoga for Every Body disc is also VERY slow paced, although with a little more focus on breath and relaxation.  In the end, this package deal wasn't as amazing as I originally thought, but as there are some variations on the Flow disc that I will incorporate into my regular rotation, and practices on the other two that I will do occasionally, I still feel that I have gotten my money's worth.",3,Mixed bag,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,938,"['three', 'discs', 'think', 'personally', 'will', 'get', 'most', 'use', 'Flow', 'Yoga', 'disc', 'different', 'practices', 'disc', 'do', ""n't"", 'differ', 'hugely', 'other', 'are', 'little', 'heavy', 'sun', 'salutations', 'three', 'discs', 'have', 'lots', 'options', 'good', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'less', 'personal', 'taste', 'see', 'other', 'comments', 'instructor', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'disc', 'background', 'Iyengar', 'yoga', 'apparent', 'practice', 'very', 'focussed', 'position', 'alignment', 'moves', 'very', 'slowly', 'Power', 'Yoga', 'Every', 'Body', 'disc', 'also', 'VERY', 'slow', 'paced', 'little', 'more', 'focus', 'breath', 'relaxation', 'end', 'package', 'deal', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'amazing', 'originally', 'thought', 'are', 'variations', 'Flow', 'disc', 'will', 'incorporate', 'regular', 'rotation', 'practices', 'other', 'two', 'will', 'do', 'occasionally', 'still', 'feel', 'have', 'gotten', 'money', 'worth']",Yoga for Weight Loss

1508612,A3CDLZ0T6U8GHO,B0062NTKVE,rockstarnurse,"[8, 10]","This three disc DVD set has the best scenery on two of the three discs; the disc with the male instructor is actually done in front of a LITERAL green screen! You know, like in the movies? I'm thinking, are they serious? They actually thought someone doing poses for any amount of time in front of a green screen would be engaging? The other two however, are set on a lovely beach, with the sound of crashing waves in the background; the second is between some gorgeous mountains and greenery. Other than the green screen, I found these DVDs just plain bored me to death. Every single pose and transition was soooooo slow and deliberate, I thought I was going to fall asleep. Not only that, the poses were rather basic and not so challenging. I guess it depends on what you're looking for.",3,"Great scenery, but....",1359331200,"01 28, 2013",2013,789,"['three', 'disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'best', 'scenery', 'two', 'three', 'discs', 'disc', 'male', 'instructor', 'actually', 'done', 'front', 'LITERAL', 'green', 'screen', 'know', 'movies', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'are', 'serious', 'actually', 'thought', 'someone', 'doing', 'poses', 'amount', 'time', 'front', 'green', 'screen', 'would', 'be', 'engaging', 'other', 'two', 'however', 'are', 'set', 'lovely', 'beach', 'sound', 'crashing', 'waves', 'background', 'second', 'gorgeous', 'mountains', 'greenery', 'Other', 'green', 'screen', 'found', 'DVDs', 'just', 'plain', 'bored', 'death', 'single', 'pose', 'transition', 'was', 'soooooo', 'slow', 'deliberate', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'fall', 'asleep', 'Not', 'only', 'poses', 'were', 'rather', 'basic', 'not', 'so', 'challenging', 'guess', 'what', ""'re"", 'looking']",Yoga for Weight Loss

The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it does not flow as quickly as some of my more favorite tapes (my fave being Rodney Yee, Colleen Saidman, and S. Deason).  It is rather slow with little breaks between the poses (probably so the poses can be spliced into other routines).  However, the stretches and poses are deep and long enough to really feel good during, after the routine, and for the rest of the day or night.  Although not in my top ten list, I would definitely recommend.  I've been practicing yoga for 3 or 4 years, am in my 50's, and consider myself intermediate at best.",4,Thorough but Slow,1361059200,"02 17, 2013",2013,686,"['have', 'many', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'one', 'ton', 'options', 'therefore', 'price', 'reason', 'gave', '4', 'instead', '5', 'not', 'flow', 'as', 'quickly', 'more', 'favorite', 'tapes', 'fave', 'being', 'Rodney', 'Yee', 'Colleen', 'Saidman', 'S.', 'Deason', 'rather', 'slow', 'little', 'breaks', 'poses', 'probably', 'so', 'poses', 'can', 'be', 'spliced', 'other', 'routines', 'However', 'stretches', 'poses', 'are', 'deep', 'long', 'enough', 'really', 'feel', 'good', 'routine', 'rest', 'day', 'night', 'not', 'top', 'ten', 'list', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', ""'ve"", 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', '3', '4', 'years', 'am', '50', 'consider', 'intermediate', 'best']",Yoga for Weight Loss
