954916,A234YMA334Q51N,B000C3L284,Jared Hadam,"[5, 8]","The reason that Jeff, Bill, and Larry are so popular is because their comedy is geared for your ordinary American worker.  If you don't like the humour (ie the last three reviews) than you are probably one of the 'upscale viewers' that the show sometimes pokes fun at.  All it takes is getting down to the Blue Collar level to enjoy these sketches, and believe me they are pretty funny.  Yes, they do tend to redo some of their routines, but that tends to be because they get a laugh every time they are used!  These guys manage to come up with fresh humour for every show, and I have not seen an episode yet that was a complete miss.  In short:  get off your high horse, get down in the mud, and laugh your rear end off.

""Blue Collar TV"" was basically an ambiguous attempt at making Jeff Foxworthy somewhat relevant in pop-culture, for the hundredth time. Please, just disappear into the briny depths of television's obscure past.The original concept was simple, if tolerable: Rednecks telling jokes about rednecks. Oh ho ho. Far from groundbreaking, but now these guys have a sketch comedy show? How many times can an audience cackle feverishly at the exact same dull mantras, like ""GIT R DUN"" and ""You might be a redneck,"" despite the fact everyone knows these jokes by now, fan or not? When will these asinine groaners lose their appeal? When will pre-pubescent Foxworthy fanboys quit repeating these self-characteratures' jokes with their crackling croaks and feigned accents?You are above this.
