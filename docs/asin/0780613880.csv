There are two different types of love here: heterosexual and homosexual, which is great because people should be true to themselves not just so they'll sleep well at nights, but so that they'll attract people who'll love them the way they are. I love that Blair Underwood and Jada Pinket-Smith have great chemistry. It's so beautiful to watch. I love that they talk about trying different delicacies, which is great because diversity is a great thing. I also love that they talk about their accomplishments because we should all have positive goals. Queen Latifah's character and her partner were great together. I took out a star because a major theme of the film is about robbing banks, which is a very bad idea. It's also a film about stereotyping people, which is a bad thing to do.

You could put this story into any situation and it would still be believable and credible. Yet there's one thing that puts ""Set It Off"" into a league of it's own, and that's the four central performances.Jada Pinkett makes a great leading lady as Stony, full of power and hope. Queen Latifah makes you fall in love with Cleo, definitely the most humorous character of the quartet but also very troubled. The scene where she tells Stony and Frankie to get out of the getaway car is heart-wrenching. Vivica .A. Fox should be a Hollywood superstar by now, her portrayal of Frankie is mesmerizing. Finally, Kimberly Elise makes a moving debut performance as Tisean, the most timid of the group, yet also the most surprising. Underrated John C. McGinty was quite effective in these supporting roles. Blair Underwood, who I like, was sort of wasted as reverse eye candy. The love story sub plot was a bit if a distraction, only in a minor way. But at the core of this film was the bond between these ladies, all driven to rob banks for various reasons.From Frankie's troubles, to Stony's hardships, there is plenty in this movie to keep your mind in motion. If you want a change of pace ""Set it Off"" is great movie to see. The writers did such a good job of weaving in the background of the characters and letting the movie play out, the quality of this film is quite impressive and I'm quite sure that you will be too!

28049,AJK5WHV1GW941,0780613880,Mikeisha Best,"[1, 2]","""Set it Off"" is an action-packed, graphic, innovative motion picture about four women who are frustrated with aspects of their lives, and who need currency to stay afloat. Stony (Jada Pinkett-Smith) lost her parents in a car accident and opts to be a motherly figure in her brother's life.  She wants her brother to go to college, but doesn't have the finances to send him, so she does something that is totally against her will to acquire the money, only to find out that he wasn't accepted to the university in the first place.  Early into the movie, her brother is gunned down because he is mistaken for a criminal because they had the same letters imprinted on their heads.  Cleo (Queen Latifah) is a seemingly naturally reckless individual.  If you aren't a friend of hers or she doesn't know you personally, she doesn't mind hurting you to get what she wants.  TeShawn (Kimberly Elise) is mildly retarded, so her friends make sure no one attempts to take advantage of her.  She has a son.  Since she cannot afford a babysitter for him, she brings him to work.  While she is laboring, he drinks a household cleaner and is poisoned.  Social workers intervene and take her son into custody because they feel she is unfit.  Unless she can make better money, they will keep him in custody.  Finally, there is Frankie (Vivica A. Fox.)  Frankie was employed at a bank until the bank is robbed and she is accused of being surreptitiously involved in the robbery.  Although in reality she had no involvement in the robbery, her supervisor opts to terminate her from her position.  Since Frankie was once employed at a bank, she knows the procedures when they are robbed...which will make it that much more easy for she and her cohorts to ""Set it Off.""  Queen Latifah and Kimberly Elise played their roles the best.  Vivica was really good as well.  But there were times were Jada was weak in her performance.The four ladies plan a detailed scheme as to how they will rob banks.  They use wigs, masks, and sunglasses to disguise themselves and guns for protection.  They rob two banks successfully until the LAPD finally catch up to them and disaster strikes.  Throughout the film, the women have the typical catfights that occur among women, but they always reconciled, which illustrated loyalty.Stony gets involved with a fellow who works at a bank (nice touch), and when the women suggest they rob the bank he works at, she immediately dismisses the thought.  Although she is against the thought, her friends outnumber her and she is forced to join them as they attempt to take on the bank he works at.  He finds out soon enough, but it doesn't necessarily change his feelings about her.  The only other relationship in the film is the lesbian courtship between Cleo and her girlfriend, Ursela.Overall this movie is great for viewing.  This subject matter has never really been touched and it was intriguing to see four WOMEN live a life of crime.My few criticisms are as follows: Why would they go into the bank while they are still going over their plan, right in the middle of public?  Someone could have easily been on to them, eavesdropped on their conversation, and their robbery would have been doomed before it began.  Also, during one of their robberies, there were police right outside trying to take down a criminal, and they didn't even notice the mayhem going on right inside of the bank.  Forgive me, I just wanted to provide food for thought.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see something cinematically different.  As previously stated, the notion of four female bank robbers hasn't really been touched in the past.

It holds your interest, but you have to suspend disbelief and have some tolerance. For one, Elise and Pinkett are major weak links in the characters; their acting is uncompelling, hammy, and often scenery-chewing. Jada Pinkett is simply not a good actress; she's mediocre, and her performances, while adequate, are never standouts. The plot was completely predictable, as was the ending, and the sub-plot of Stoney's romance was particularly unbelievable; 2 people from those backgrounds would never hook up in real life. The Godfather scene was particularly lame. Sorry, but it was. There were some touches of realism, but not enough to elevate the movie from the cliche. Not a worthless film by any means, but again, no classic.

28062,ABE14SVILZLNY,0780613880,"SID ""Punk""","[5, 7]","""Set it Off"" is far from remarkable, but it's amiable and entertaining. The screenplay was definitely written by amateurs, packing as much melodrama into the storyline as possible. First we introduce the character of Jada Pinkett's brother. She's like a mother figure to him, since their parents are dead. He's a nice guy, gets into a fight with his sister and flees the house. It's no surprise when he turns out dead two scenes later. Then Kimberly Elise's child accidentally swallows some household substances and the custody of the kid is handed over to child services. We have Vivica A. Fox who got fired from her job at the bank and Queen Latifah who's just plain crazy. Basically, the character motivations seem ripped from a soap opera.The film is predictable from the get-go, so just strap in for the ride. Don't expect high-class writing and high-class direction, especially from the guy who made ""Friday."" Don't get me wrong, that was a good movie, but like ""Set it Off"" it's only valuable as lightweight entertainment.One thing I have to say is this is one black movie that didn't go for the humdrum ""white people bad, black people good"" premise. I assumed that was the direction the film was going after watching the first scene in which the white bank manager fires Vivica for not following procedure, totally ignoring the fact that she was at gunpoint, along with everyone else in the bank. But then we get introduced to the other two managers, who are both black and both sleazy. Not to say that black people are sleazy; it's just good knowing that the writers weren't associating the term ""white"" with ""sleazy"" and didn't see the characters in terms of color. Even the John C. McGinley character, the detective who is out to get the four women, isn't entirely sadistic.SPOILERS AHEADThere are a few moments that are just too silly for their own good. Are you telling me two cops are gonna be so distracted by an obnoxious vagrant that they'll totally disregard a bank robbery (literally) taking place right behind them? As I said, you can tell this was written by amateurs. And then we have Queen Latifah driving through the bank in a minivan, which is stupid in the first place and shown simply for cinematic pretentiousness, and the four women drive out, still not being actively pursued by the cops. Latifah makes one turn and suddenly she loses the cops altogether? That's too much disbelief to suspend. And of course, in the usual cinematic tradition, the minor characters have to die first. Kimberly Elise dies in standard operatic fashion--in someone's arms, saying her last words. Only in the movies can someone die like that 90 % of the time.The acting is pretty good, though sometimes hammy. When Jada sees her brother dead on the street, screaming and crying out, ""Whyyyyy!!"" (I could be paraphrasing), that was too much. Latifah's role as a crazy thug wasn't much of a stretch, especially since this film was made back in her hip-hop days. She is a fine actress, though, and I prefer her more mature roles in films like ""Living Out Loud."" John C. McGinley and Blair Underwood add a touch of class.If F. Gary Gray weren't so dependent on melodrama and big action spectacles to create tension, this wouldn't been a much more compelling film. Maybe someone like John Singleton or the Hughes Brothers could've made this a more powerful film. Just don't set your expectations too high and you should have a good time.",4,Amateurish but entertaining,1038873600,"12 3, 2002",2002,3440,"['Set', 'Off', 'far', 'remarkable', 'amiable', 'entertaining', 'screenplay', 'was', 'definitely', 'written', 'amateurs', 'packing', 'as', 'much', 'melodrama', 'storyline', 'possible', 'First', 'introduce', 'character', 'Jada', 'Pinkett', 'brother', 'mother', 'figure', 'parents', 'are', 'dead', 'nice', 'guy', 'fight', 'sister', 'house', 'surprise', 'when', 'out', 'dead', 'two', 'scenes', 'later', 'Then', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'child', 'accidentally', 'household', 'substances', 'custody', 'kid', 'handed', 'child', 'services', 'have', 'Vivica', 'A', 'Fox', 'who', 'got', 'fired', 'job', 'bank', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'who', 'just', 'plain', 'crazy', 'Basically', 'character', 'motivations', 'seem', 'ripped', 'soap', 'opera.The', 'film', 'predictable', 'get-go', 'so', 'just', 'strap', 'ride', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'high-class', 'writing', 'high-class', 'direction', 'especially', 'guy', 'who', 'made', 'Friday', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'good', 'movie', 'Set', 'Off', 'only', 'valuable', 'lightweight', 'thing', 'have', 'say', 'one', 'black', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'humdrum', 'white', 'people', 'bad', 'black', 'people', 'good', 'premise', 'assumed', 'was', 'direction', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'watching', 'first', 'scene', 'white', 'bank', 'manager', 'fires', 'Vivica', 'not', 'following', 'procedure', 'totally', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'was', 'gunpoint', 'everyone', 'else', 'bank', 'then', 'get', 'introduced', 'other', 'two', 'managers', 'who', 'are', 'black', 'sleazy', 'Not', 'say', 'black', 'people', 'are', 'sleazy', 'just', 'good', 'knowing', 'writers', 'were', ""n't"", 'associating', 'term', 'white', 'sleazy', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'characters', 'terms', 'color', 'Even', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'character', 'detective', 'who', 'out', 'get', 'four', 'women', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'sadistic.SPOILERS', 'AHEADThere', 'are', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'silly', 'own', 'good', 'Are', 'telling', 'two', 'cops', 'are', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'so', 'distracted', 'obnoxious', 'vagrant', ""'ll"", 'totally', 'disregard', 'bank', 'robbery', 'literally', 'taking', 'place', 'right', 'said', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'written', 'amateurs', 'then', 'have', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'driving', 'bank', 'minivan', 'stupid', 'first', 'place', 'shown', 'simply', 'cinematic', 'pretentiousness', 'four', 'women', 'drive', 'out', 'still', 'not', 'being', 'actively', 'pursued', 'cops', 'Latifah', 'one', 'turn', 'suddenly', 'cops', 'altogether', 'too', 'much', 'disbelief', 'suspend', 'course', 'usual', 'cinematic', 'tradition', 'minor', 'characters', 'have', 'die', 'first', 'Kimberly', 'Elise', 'standard', 'operatic', 'fashion', 'someone', 'arms', 'saying', 'last', 'words', 'Only', 'movies', 'can', 'someone', 'die', '90', '%', 'time.The', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'sometimes', 'hammy', 'When', 'Jada', 'brother', 'dead', 'street', 'screaming', 'crying', 'out', 'Whyyyyy', 'could', 'be', 'paraphrasing', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'Latifah', 'role', 'crazy', 'thug', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'stretch', 'especially', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'back', 'hip-hop', 'days', 'fine', 'actress', 'prefer', 'more', 'mature', 'roles', 'films', 'Living', 'Out', 'Loud', 'John', 'C.', 'McGinley', 'Blair', 'Underwood', 'add', 'touch', 'class.If', 'F.', 'Gary', 'Gray', 'were', ""n't"", 'so', 'dependent', 'melodrama', 'big', 'action', 'spectacles', 'create', 'tension', 'would', ""n't"", 'been', 'much', 'more', 'compelling', 'film', 'Maybe', 'someone', 'John', 'Singleton', 'Hughes', 'Brothers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'made', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'set', 'expectations', 'too', 'high', 'should', 'have', 'good', 'time']",N/A

28067,A178LLZ84A2JB5,0780613880,"S. Spears ""Artwomyn""","[2, 3]","Set It Off is an explosive drama about four young black women, who are best friends. Living in the Los Angeles ghetto, each of them struggles with economic and emotional hardships. All of them suffer deeply, due to injustices perpetrated against them by their employers, trigger-happy cops, and the welfare bureaucracy. Fed-up with how life has knocked them around, and desperate to escape the ghetto, the four friends decide to resort to robbing banks together.This film is very fast-paced, with gripping suspense throughout the course of the movie. There's scarcely a dull moment. This movie is overflowing with tire-screeching car chases, blazing gunfire, and volatile interactions between the characters. The breath-taking action sequences really draw you in to the precarious world, of the criminal quartet.It's good that Hollywood finally decided to make a film, that has African-American female characters who make such a deep impact. They're just as rough, vulgar, and determined to change their lives for the better, as any of the male characters are. They're deadly serious about being willing to risk their lives, to take up criminal activities. The women in the film, don't depend on men to determine their course of action. They know that it's up to them alone, to work together to accomplish their bank heists.The four actresses who played the main characters, all give strong performances. Especially Queen Latifah as the hardened butch lesbian, Cleo Simms. She really makes the viewer believe that Cleo can fearlessly handle just about anything, that she's up against. Jada Pinkett also gives a compelling performance as Stoney. Pinkett shows an amazing emotional range, and is able to convey the contradictory moods of Stoney with ease. Vivica Fox as Frankie, is vivid in her role, but not quite as charismatic as either Queen Latifah, or Jada Pinkett. Kimberley Elise as the desperate single mother, Tisean, gives a heartrending performance.This film crackles with a heady intensity, that's rare in films with women as the main characters. These sistahs prove that they are forces to be reckoned with, as they fight for their dreams in a male dominated world.
