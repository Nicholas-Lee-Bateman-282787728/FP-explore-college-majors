'Darr' is not just a romantic saga or a melodramatic flick, it is a complete entertainment from start to end and will glue your eyes completely to the screen. Shahrukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and Sunny Deol deliver brilliant performances and leave no effort to do justice to their respective roles. The plot is such that it keeps drawing you more and more into it. Everything from the characters to the romantic and sometimes haunting atmospheres will spellbind you. The film has strong characterizations and brilliant direction from Yash Chopra makes this film worth a watch ample of times. On every viewing of the film, you will always experience a thrill.",5,"The maniac, the hero the and the beauty!",1328832000,"02 10, 2012",2012,680,"['class', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'just', 'romantic', 'saga', 'melodramatic', 'flick', 'complete', 'entertainment', 'start', 'end', 'will', 'glue', 'eyes', 'completely', 'screen', 'Shahrukh', 'Khan', 'Juhi', 'Chawla', 'Sunny', 'Deol', 'deliver', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'leave', 'effort', 'do', 'justice', 'respective', 'roles', 'plot', 'such', 'drawing', 'more', 'more', 'Everything', 'characters', 'romantic', 'sometimes', 'haunting', 'atmospheres', 'will', 'spellbind', 'film', 'strong', 'characterizations', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'Yash', 'Chopra', 'film', 'watch', 'ample', 'times', 'viewing', 'film', 'will', 'always', 'experience', 'thrill']",Darr

It's quite different from other Bollywood films we've watched, as there is a dark element to it.  Shah Rukh Khan, my teenaged daughters favorite actor, plays a stalker - a  man so obsessed with a woman that doesn't even know him - that he is willing to kill her fiance to have her.  He manages to hide his obsession from everyone, including the father  he lives with.The music and dancing were great, but my daughter had us turn this one off, as she is such a fan of Shah Rukh Khan, she couldn't bear to see him in such a negative role!  Ah, teenagers, right?If you don't mind watching older Bollywood, with a little bit of Hollywood obsession added to it, pick up Darr.  If you'd rather not see the usual hero carving the name Karin into his chest with a sharp knife, better pass on this one!",4,Daughter is such a fan of Shah Rukh Khan - she couldn't finish this movie!,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",2011,893,"['Darr', 'feeling', 'already', 'being', 'bit', 'outdated', 'even', 'was', 'filmed', 'early', '90', 'quite', 'different', 'other', 'Bollywood', 'films', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'dark', 'element', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'teenaged', 'daughters', 'favorite', 'actor', 'stalker', 'man', 'so', 'obsessed', 'woman', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'willing', 'kill', 'fiance', 'have', 'hide', 'obsession', 'everyone', 'including', 'father', 'with.The', 'music', 'dancing', 'were', 'great', 'daughter', 'had', 'turn', 'one', 'off', 'such', 'fan', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'could', ""n't"", 'bear', 'see', 'negative', 'role', 'Ah', 'teenagers', 'right', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'older', 'Bollywood', 'little', 'bit', 'Hollywood', 'obsession', 'added', 'pick', 'up', 'Darr', ""'d"", 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'usual', 'hero', 'carving', 'name', 'Karin', 'chest', 'sharp', 'knife', 'better', 'pass', 'one']",Darr

He is obsessed with a young woman (Juhi Chawla) and cannot shake it off even when she gets married. This obsession is smoldering inside and has not been manifested to anyone.Anupam Kher plays an idiotic and comical cricket fanatic, who talk sanely only once, when he is the first one to suspect the diabolic SRK.The movie has good, hauntingly composed songs, worth listening even today.SRK should be commended to take on such a negative role and has put a lot of life into it. He makes your skin crawl; very effective, that! A top ranking star in Bollywood has to strategise carefully about his roles in order not to alienate his fan following.There are a lot of events in the story, but the good prevails over the bad, like in all commercial Bollywood cinema.The movie is a must see for SRK's extraordinary acting and the excellent songs.",4,A well dressed maniac!,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",2011,922,"['movie', 'great', 'Bollywood', 'actor', 'Shah', 'Rukh', 'Khan', 'SRK', 'negative', 'role', 'obsessed', 'young', 'woman', 'Juhi', 'Chawla', 'can', 'not', 'shake', 'off', 'even', 'when', 'married', 'obsession', 'smoldering', 'inside', 'not', 'been', 'manifested', 'anyone.Anupam', 'Kher', 'idiotic', 'comical', 'cricket', 'fanatic', 'who', 'talk', 'sanely', 'only', 'once', 'when', 'first', 'one', 'suspect', 'diabolic', 'SRK.The', 'movie', 'good', 'hauntingly', 'composed', 'songs', 'listening', 'even', 'today.SRK', 'should', 'be', 'commended', 'take', 'negative', 'role', 'put', 'lot', 'life', 'skin', 'crawl', 'very', 'effective', 'top', 'ranking', 'star', 'Bollywood', 'strategise', 'carefully', 'roles', 'order', 'not', 'alienate', 'fan', 'are', 'lot', 'events', 'story', 'good', 'prevails', 'bad', 'commercial', 'Bollywood', 'cinema.The', 'movie', 'must', 'see', 'SRK', 'extraordinary', 'acting', 'excellent', 'songs']",Darr

He steals the film from all the other actors. The scene where he is playing the drum at her house where they are having a party and she does not suspect him has to be my favorite. I had a hard time hating him. I felt more sorry for him than anything else.
