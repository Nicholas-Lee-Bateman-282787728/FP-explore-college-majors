1033288,A3TJJHMWV3SFNI,B000KF0DFM,"Brett Heitkam ""DVD obsessed""","[4, 5]","Lucky Louie was a sitcom produced by and aired on HBO, the premium cable network known for its boundary-pushing dramas like Oz and The Sopranos.  Lucky Louie, however, is just as boundary-pushing, but this time in the form of an average, run-of-the-mill family sitcom.  But, believe me, this is not a show for the whole family to enjoy.This very adult-oriented series features a normal, everyday working class family and the problems and issues they face raising their daughter and living together in their small apartment.  We have Louie, the stay-at-home dad who works part-time at the Muffler Shop owned by his best friend Mike.  Then we have Kim, the very put-upon wife and mother who works full-time as a nurse and then comes home to take care of Louie and their daughter.  Lucy, a precocious four-year-old, rounds out this small family.Amongst lots of swearing and male nudity, this sitcom actually has a lot of heart.  The characters and stories are very realistic.  Many viewers will be able to identify with the everyday problems this series deals with.  The show is filmed in front of a live audience, which, even though I'm not sure why, makes it even more entertaining to watch.  I don't want to spoil any of the plots or storylines that weave through this thirteen episode season, so just buy it! You will love it!The DVDs themselves are top-notch.  The show is presented in widescreen and looks great.

1033291,A33G2XG1S5NSH1,B000KF0DFM,"Bryant Burnette ""Bryant Burnette""","[69, 75]","""Lucky Louie"" got a whole sackful of lousy reviews when it premiered on HBO, and most of them seemed to take issue with how crass the show's tone was.  Since I had just recently subscribed to HBO and was determined to watch ALL of their typically excellent original programming, I decided that I would watch the first episode, despite the bad reviews.Half an hour later, I'd been laughing for nearly half an hour.  This is a FUNNY show.  Yes, there is a lot of profanity; yes, there are some uncomfortable bits involving how inadvertently racist the main character is.  But so what?  It's nothing compared to ""Deadwood,"" I assure you of that.There's nothing here that's exactly groundbreaking or revolutionary; it's really a very normal sitcom in the vein of something you might have seen in the late '70s to mid-'80s.  The plots are typical of that genre.  But the characters talk like real people (or at least like real people I know; maybe you don't know people like this, but I certainly do), and they kind of act like real people, too.  At least, Louie and Kim do; the other characters fall more in the vein of the typical wacky sitcom character.  They're kind of like potty-mouthed Kramers.Somehow, for me, what all this adds up to is a VERY loving portrayal of a marriage.  Louie is constantly doing something incredibly boneheaded to make his wife, Kim, slackjawed with astonishment.  The specifics may well be flights of fancy, but the reactions seem very genuine.  This, to me, FEELS like a real married couple.  They don't necessarily like each other very much, but they definitely love each other.  That may sound like a contradiction, but you may change your mind after watching these DVDs.The actig is generally strong.  Louis C.K. is sort of in the same tradition as Jerry Seinfeld and Ray Romano in the sense that while you can't exactly make a claim for him being a great actor, you also can't imagine his show without him in it.  Pamela Adlon -- who also does Bobby's voice on ""King of the Hill"" -- is terrific as Kim; she's sharp, sexier than heck, and very funny in a put-upon sort of way.  The aforementioned wacky sitcom characters are played by Michael G. Hagerty, Jim Norton, Laura Kightlinger, and Rick Shapiro, and they are all very, very funny.Also definitely worth mentioning are Jerry Minor and Kimberly Hawthorne, who play Louie and Kim's African American neighbors.  There is a very funny dynamic between these two couples, in which Louie tries VERY hard to make friends with Walter simply because he's never had a black friend before.  Naturally, Louie overcompensates and ends up being more of a racist by accident than many men manage on purpose.  Some of these scenes are just hysterical, mostly because of Minor's droll performance.  In some episodes, you can see that he is so put upon by his wife that he tries to put up with Louie, just so he'll have someone else to talk to.  This is all handled in a manner close to perfection.To sum up, I think this was a pretty terrific show.  It's VERY funny, touching in an unexpected sort of way, and in its own fashion it's up to par with the rest of HBO's intimidatingly good output.  I'm confused as to why critics didn't find this to be the case, and I'm hopeful that the DVDs will help the show find the audience it deserves, even if it IS after the fact.",4,"very funny series, cancelled too soon",1163894400,"11 19, 2006",2006,3340,"['Lucky', 'Louie', 'got', 'whole', 'sackful', 'lousy', 'reviews', 'when', 'premiered', 'HBO', 'most', 'seemed', 'take', 'issue', 'how', 'crass', 'show', 'tone', 'was', 'had', 'just', 'recently', 'subscribed', 'HBO', 'was', 'determined', 'watch', 'typically', 'excellent', 'original', 'programming', 'decided', 'would', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'bad', 'reviews.Half', 'hour', 'later', ""'d"", 'been', 'laughing', 'nearly', 'hour', 'FUNNY', 'show', 'Yes', 'lot', 'profanity', 'yes', 'are', 'uncomfortable', 'bits', 'involving', 'how', 'inadvertently', 'racist', 'main', 'character', 'so', 'what', 'nothing', 'compared', 'Deadwood', 'assure', 'nothing', 'here', 'exactly', 'groundbreaking', 'revolutionary', 'really', 'very', 'normal', 'sitcom', 'vein', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'seen', 'late', ""'70s"", ""mid-'80s"", 'plots', 'are', 'typical', 'genre', 'characters', 'talk', 'real', 'people', 'least', 'like', 'real', 'people', 'know', 'maybe', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'people', 'certainly', 'do', 'kind', 'act', 'real', 'people', 'too', 'least', 'Louie', 'Kim', 'do', 'other', 'characters', 'fall', 'more', 'vein', 'typical', 'wacky', 'sitcom', 'character', ""'re"", 'kind', 'potty-mouthed', 'Kramers.Somehow', 'what', 'up', 'VERY', 'loving', 'portrayal', 'marriage', 'Louie', 'constantly', 'doing', 'something', 'incredibly', 'boneheaded', 'make', 'wife', 'Kim', 'slackjawed', 'astonishment', 'specifics', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'flights', 'fancy', 'reactions', 'seem', 'very', 'genuine', 'FEELS', 'real', 'married', 'couple', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'other', 'very', 'much', 'definitely', 'love', 'other', 'may', 'sound', 'contradiction', 'may', 'change', 'mind', 'watching', 'DVDs.The', 'actig', 'generally', 'strong', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'sort', 'same', 'tradition', 'Jerry', 'Seinfeld', 'Ray', 'Romano', 'sense', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'make', 'claim', 'being', 'great', 'actor', 'also', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'show', 'Pamela', 'Adlon', 'who', 'also', 'Bobby', 'voice', 'King', 'Hill', 'terrific', 'Kim', 'sharp', 'sexier', 'heck', 'very', 'funny', 'put-upon', 'sort', 'way', 'aforementioned', 'wacky', 'sitcom', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'Michael', 'G.', 'Hagerty', 'Jim', 'Norton', 'Laura', 'Kightlinger', 'Rick', 'Shapiro', 'are', 'very', 'very', 'funny.Also', 'definitely', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'are', 'Jerry', 'Minor', 'Kimberly', 'Hawthorne', 'who', 'play', 'Louie', 'Kim', 'African', 'American', 'neighbors', 'very', 'funny', 'dynamic', 'two', 'couples', 'Louie', 'VERY', 'hard', 'make', 'friends', 'Walter', 'simply', 'never', 'had', 'black', 'friend', 'Naturally', 'Louie', 'up', 'being', 'more', 'racist', 'accident', 'many', 'men', 'manage', 'purpose', 'scenes', 'are', 'just', 'hysterical', 'mostly', 'Minor', 'droll', 'performance', 'episodes', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'put', 'upon', 'wife', 'put', 'up', 'Louie', 'just', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'someone', 'else', 'talk', 'handled', 'manner', 'close', 'perfection.To', 'sum', 'think', 'was', 'pretty', 'terrific', 'show', 'VERY', 'funny', 'touching', 'unexpected', 'sort', 'way', 'own', 'fashion', 'up', 'par', 'rest', 'HBO', 'intimidatingly', 'good', 'output', ""'m"", 'confused', 'why', 'critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'be', 'case', ""'m"", 'hopeful', 'DVDs', 'will', 'help', 'show', 'find', 'audience', 'even', 'fact']",Lucky Louie - The Complete First Season

Louis C.K. is very talented, of course, and he tries a lot of different ideas in this sit com format. In this sitcom he has a wife, a low level job and one young daughter.  He has been married for 7 years. The comedy involves his family life whereas his career is very minimal in an auto shop. I think what he used this for was to try out ideas and then learned from his hits and misses on this show how to shape his next show, which became the wildly successful LOUIE, now in its fourth season. That new show is patterned on his real life as a stand up comic and divorced dad of two young daughters and is outstanding. He does all the writing himself for all of his tv and stand up ventures.

While some of the situations took unrealistic jumps (one week they're paying all their bills at a check cashing joint; a few weeks later, they're shopping at Whole Foods and have a bank account), that wasn't the selling point or the main idea of the show.  In many sitcoms, marriage is portrayed as this sickly sweet, conflict-quickly-resolved arrangement with stilted dialogue and trite conclusions, but not one of Louie's episodes ended in this way. In fact, profanity/nudity aside, the depiction of marriage and parenting is one of the most honest that's come across my television.In ""Discipline"", Louie and Kim are faced with the dilemma of how to discipline their child.  It's not an easy situation and it's not resolved by the end of the episode, though by that point you know enough about the characters to understand that they are going to keep trying to teach their kid how to behave properly.  That, to me, is realistic parenting - a combination of resolve, frustration and pragmatism.Such a great show and such a shame it ended too soon.",4,A realistic sitcom marriage,1171065600,"02 10, 2007",2007,1137,"['many', 'HBO', 'subscribers', 'Lucky', 'Louie', 'was', 'show', 'loved', 'hated', 'tried', 'get', 'situations', 'took', 'unrealistic', 'jumps', 'one', 'week', ""'re"", 'paying', 'bills', 'check', 'cashing', 'joint', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', ""'re"", 'shopping', 'Whole', 'Foods', 'have', 'bank', 'account', 'was', ""n't"", 'selling', 'point', 'main', 'idea', 'show', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'marriage', 'portrayed', 'sickly', 'sweet', 'conflict-quickly-resolved', 'arrangement', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'trite', 'conclusions', 'not', 'one', 'Louie', 'episodes', 'ended', 'way', 'fact', 'profanity/nudity', 'aside', 'depiction', 'marriage', 'parenting', 'one', 'most', 'honest', 'come', 'television.In', 'Discipline', 'Louie', 'Kim', 'are', 'faced', 'dilemma', 'how', 'discipline', 'child', 'not', 'easy', 'situation', 'not', 'resolved', 'end', 'episode', 'point', 'know', 'enough', 'characters', 'understand', 'are', 'going', 'keep', 'trying', 'teach', 'kid', 'how', 'behave', 'properly', 'realistic', 'parenting', 'combination', 'resolve', 'frustration', 'pragmatism.Such', 'great', 'show', 'shame', 'ended', 'too', 'soon']",Lucky Louie - The Complete First Season

I instantly became a fan watching all of his other specials and his show Louie which I find to be one of the best and most original shows currently airing on television. I had been aware of this show for a while and finally decided to check it out.Lucky Louie is a short-lived HBO show that only aired for one season despite having pretty good ratings. The cancellation behind the show apparently had to do with the network not like having a show that depicted a working class family on a station that is considered &#34;high class&#34;. It's a shame too because while no where as great as his current show, Lucky Louie is a unique and very funny show that really wasn't giving a fair chance. If you watch this show expecting something similar to Louie though, you'll be very disappointed. The concept of the show is a very simple, an 80's esque sitcom with no boundaries that covers very mature subjects and themes. The show deals with everything from sex to alcoholism and features everything from explicit profanity to full frontal nudity.  In other words, this is not your typical sitcom. But that is what makes Lucky Louie so enjoyable, it's a nice and original idea mixed with Louis brand of humor and the results are mostly hilarious. The cast is very good and the supporting characters are very enjoyable to watch as well. The encounters between Louie and his African-American neighbor as some of the funniest scenes the series has to offer.With that said, the series does suffer from it's writing occasionally when it feels like it's try too hard to be raunchy and self-aware. A great example of this would be a scene in an episode that involves Louie calling his Wife the &#34;C-word&#34; and the aftermath. A scene takes place in a bar with Louie and his friends talking about the word and repeatedly using it. The scene starts out funny, but goes on for too long and begins to feel much more forced and the laughs begin to turn into groans. This problem comes up every once in a while and it's annoying when it does, but it's never frequent or strong enough to ruin an episode or the series as a whole.It's a shame this show was never given a fair chance as it's a very funny and original show. Although, it's nowhere as great or brilliant than the now-airing Louie is, it's still a very good show that's worth watching if you're a fan of Louis other material.",4,Worth Checking Out if You're a Louis C.K Fan,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",2014,2512,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'Louis', 'C.K', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'ever', 'seeing', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'Chewed', 'Up', 'special', 'Netflix', 'instantly', 'became', 'fan', 'watching', 'other', 'specials', 'show', 'Louie', 'find', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'original', 'shows', 'currently', 'airing', 'television', 'had', 'been', 'aware', 'show', 'while', 'finally', 'decided', 'check', 'out.Lucky', 'Louie', 'short-lived', 'HBO', 'show', 'only', 'aired', 'one', 'season', 'having', 'pretty', 'good', 'ratings', 'cancellation', 'show', 'apparently', 'had', 'do', 'network', 'not', 'having', 'show', 'depicted', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'station', 'considered', '34', 'high', 'class', '34', 'shame', 'too', 'where', 'as', 'great', 'current', 'show', 'Lucky', 'Louie', 'unique', 'very', 'funny', 'show', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'giving', 'fair', 'chance', 'watch', 'show', 'expecting', 'something', 'similar', 'Louie', ""'ll"", 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'concept', 'show', 'very', 'simple', '80', 'esque', 'sitcom', 'boundaries', 'very', 'mature', 'subjects', 'themes', 'show', 'everything', 'sex', 'alcoholism', 'features', 'everything', 'explicit', 'profanity', 'full', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'typical', 'sitcom', 'what', 'Lucky', 'Louie', 'so', 'enjoyable', 'nice', 'original', 'idea', 'mixed', 'Louis', 'brand', 'humor', 'results', 'are', 'mostly', 'hilarious', 'cast', 'very', 'good', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'as', 'well', 'encounters', 'Louie', 'African-American', 'neighbor', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'series', 'offer.With', 'said', 'series', 'suffer', 'writing', 'occasionally', 'when', 'try', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'raunchy', 'self-aware', 'great', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'scene', 'episode', 'Louie', 'calling', 'Wife', '34', 'C-word', '34', 'aftermath', 'scene', 'place', 'bar', 'Louie', 'friends', 'talking', 'word', 'repeatedly', 'using', 'scene', 'out', 'funny', 'too', 'long', 'feel', 'much', 'more', 'forced', 'laughs', 'begin', 'turn', 'groans', 'problem', 'up', 'once', 'while', 'annoying', 'when', 'never', 'frequent', 'strong', 'enough', 'ruin', 'episode', 'series', 'whole.It', 'shame', 'show', 'was', 'never', 'given', 'fair', 'chance', 'very', 'funny', 'original', 'show', 'nowhere', 'as', 'great', 'brilliant', 'now-airing', 'Louie', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'worth', 'watching', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Louis', 'other', 'material']",Lucky Louie - The Complete First Season
