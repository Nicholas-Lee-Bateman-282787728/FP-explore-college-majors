I just finished seeing it for the first time recently, and I can say hands down that this was far and away the worst movie that Steven Seagal has ever made.

Most of his old movies went somewhere, but this one was one violence, bad language filled scene after scene after scene.

921118,A34A7QEBMYTALW,B000A5043S,"Arthur Kicker ""Ragged, Tagged, and Bodybagged""","[50, 65]","September 13th 2005 heralded the release of 'Today You Die', Lord Steven Seagal's latest offering to his mass of devout followers.  The movie, before its release, got a bit of a reputation due to the fact that the Lord was consistently late to set, usually left early, constantly changed the script, actors, etc.  I also believe that Seagal is actually getting sued for his Lordly antics.'Today You Die' has an inconceivable plot, but I will do my best:  The Lordage is an ex-thief trying to go straight so he picks up a job as an armored car driver, only he's setup by some criminal mastermind named Max to take the fall for the robbery of the armored car.  But somehow or other(its never really explained), the Lord does what the Lord does and ends up with the $20 million that Max was supposed to have stolen.  The Lord is captured by the police and sent to prison(with no trial mind you).  There he meets his apparently new best friend Ice(former Naughty By Nature rapper Treach in a truly Oscar-caliber performance).  Well, the Lord and his new bosom buddy break out of prison.  Of course the evil gangsters want the money that the Lord stole from them back.  But Seagal can't let that happen.  Its not really about the money, but more of a moral principle-type issue for him.Now that is a much more coherent outline of what actually happens in 'Today You Die'.  There's actually a whole lot more that I left out:  Seagal's girlfriend's psychic visions which mean absolutely nothing to the film, the PMSing female cop who puts him in prison and then becomes his best buddy for no apparent reason once he breaks out, the second bad guy in the film that has nothing to do with the evil Max, and the little girl at the end of the movie who nevers appears or is even mentioned in the entire film but to Seagal apparently has some important connection .  This movie makes no sense at all.  None.Now, onto the Lordage:  he actually looks as if he's slimmed down a bit(maybe dropping from 350 pounds to around 320).  His hair is disguistingly nappy and he doesn't even bother ponytailing it; it just hangs limply over his collar in total mullet fashion.  There are a couple bright spots here though:  #1) there's minimal dubbing of the Lord's voice by someone else(see 'Out Of Reach' or 'Submerged' for some examples of how not to dub someone's voice)and #2) Seagal rocks a totally sweet brown pleather coat for about half the film.With the film's excessive use of stock footage from other direct-to-DVD films, overly obvious use of a stunt double for Seagal(even in situations where no stunts are involved), horrible editing, and a completely nonsensical and confusing plot 'Today You Die' is easily Seagal's laziest film to date.I'd tell you to save your time and skip it, but every other Seagal fan out there like me will go buy 'Today You Die' and watch it anyway.  So if you must watch it, there are only three amusing things to look for:  Seagal's sweet pleather jacket, the Lord talking Jive to his new black buddy, and Seagal swinging on a chandolier.  Hilarious.I love the Lord and would give him my first born, but why does he torture me with filth like this so often?",1,Today You Crap,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,3176,"['September', '13th', '2005', 'heralded', 'release', ""'Today"", 'Die', 'Lord', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'latest', 'offering', 'mass', 'devout', 'followers', 'movie', 'release', 'got', 'bit', 'reputation', 'due', 'fact', 'Lord', 'was', 'consistently', 'late', 'set', 'usually', 'left', 'early', 'constantly', 'changed', 'script', 'actors', 'etc', 'also', 'believe', 'Seagal', 'actually', 'getting', 'sued', 'Lordly', 'antics', 'Die', 'inconceivable', 'plot', 'will', 'do', 'best', 'Lordage', 'ex-thief', 'trying', 'go', 'straight', 'so', 'up', 'job', 'armored', 'car', 'driver', 'only', 'setup', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'named', 'Max', 'take', 'fall', 'robbery', 'armored', 'car', 'somehow', 'other', 'never', 'really', 'explained', 'Lord', 'what', 'Lord', 'up', '20', 'million', 'Max', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'stolen', 'Lord', 'captured', 'police', 'sent', 'prison', 'trial', 'mind', 'apparently', 'new', 'best', 'friend', 'Ice', 'former', 'Naughty', 'Nature', 'rapper', 'Treach', 'truly', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performance', 'Well', 'Lord', 'new', 'bosom', 'buddy', 'break', 'prison', 'course', 'evil', 'gangsters', 'want', 'money', 'Lord', 'stole', 'back', 'Seagal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'happen', 'not', 'really', 'money', 'more', 'moral', 'principle-type', 'issue', 'him.Now', 'much', 'more', 'coherent', 'outline', 'what', 'actually', ""'Today"", 'Die', 'actually', 'whole', 'lot', 'more', 'left', 'out', 'Seagal', 'girlfriend', 'psychic', 'visions', 'mean', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'film', 'PMSing', 'female', 'cop', 'who', 'prison', 'then', 'best', 'buddy', 'apparent', 'reason', 'out', 'second', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'nothing', 'do', 'evil', 'Max', 'little', 'girl', 'end', 'movie', 'who', 'even', 'mentioned', 'entire', 'film', 'Seagal', 'apparently', 'important', 'connection', 'movie', 'sense', 'None.Now', 'Lordage', 'actually', 'slimmed', 'down', 'bit', 'maybe', 'dropping', '350', 'pounds', '320', 'hair', 'disguistingly', 'nappy', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'ponytailing', 'just', 'limply', 'collar', 'total', 'mullet', 'fashion', 'are', 'couple', 'bright', 'spots', 'here', '1', 'minimal', 'dubbing', 'Lord', 'voice', 'someone', 'else', 'see', ""'Out"", 'Reach', ""'Submerged"", 'examples', 'how', 'not', 'dub', 'someone', 'voice', '2', 'Seagal', 'totally', 'sweet', 'pleather', 'coat', 'film.With', 'film', 'excessive', 'use', 'stock', 'footage', 'other', 'direct-to-DVD', 'films', 'overly', 'obvious', 'use', 'stunt', 'double', 'Seagal', 'even', 'situations', 'where', 'stunts', 'are', 'involved', 'horrible', 'editing', 'completely', 'nonsensical', 'confusing', 'plot', 'Die', 'easily', 'Seagal', 'laziest', 'film', 'date.I', ""'d"", 'tell', 'save', 'time', 'skip', 'other', 'Seagal', 'fan', 'there', 'will', 'go', 'buy', ""'Today"", 'Die', 'watch', 'anyway', 'So', 'must', 'watch', 'are', 'only', 'three', 'amusing', 'things', 'look', 'Seagal', 'sweet', 'pleather', 'jacket', 'Lord', 'talking', 'Jive', 'new', 'black', 'buddy', 'Seagal', 'swinging', 'chandolier', 'Hilarious.I', 'love', 'Lord', 'would', 'give', 'first', 'born', 'why', 'torture', 'filth', 'so', 'often']",Today You Die

The film is idiotic in nature, with possibly the most horrid acting since Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  The plot is mind numbingly unrealistic (not even worth mentioning), in addition to the fact Seagal looks like 30 feet of bad road kill.  He's overweight (is it any wonder he wears a bulky coat throughout the movie-hide that gut, Seagal-hide that gut) and over the hill, his hair transplant looks like it was grafted from a mangy dog, and his acting is the pits.  Yet, in true Steven Seagal center-of-attention wannabe form, he gets the beautiful girl (who has to be 25 years his junior).  Yeah, right.It's obvious to just about everyone who is paying attention (excluding Seagal), that his days as a top box office draw are long gone.  I'd personally like to see him in a Grumpy Old Men type of film, perhaps with Chuck Norris and/or David Carradine. No more of these improbable only 10 years away from senior citizen discounts though I'm still able to conquer the world through brute force type of flicks.  Yawn.Someone needs to tell this clown that he's fat, a disgustingly deficient actor sporting a grotesquely unnecessary mangy mop of a hair transplant, with a fatally career killing severe case of an unwarranted superiority complex.  For me, his excessive narcissism comes forth in his performance, or lack thereof.  Honestly, I feel sorry for the guy.  He definitely needs to grow up.

Then blows some stuff up. And finally, copies Bad Boys as much as it can before it races to a close.""Today You Die"" is a movie that goes a long way in showing that one picture is worth at least a thousand letters of hate mail.  Write in and tell Steven Seagal to give the rest of the money he would spend on making movies to the homeless and dedicate the rest of his creative energy into ending world hunger, saving those trees he cares so much about, or getting a hair cut so he doesn't look like the Count from Sesame Street after he wakes up after a full day of drinking beer and eating cheetos in his trailer. To tell you the truth, I actually like Steven Seagal. But his stuff is getting worse. Trying to watch his films now is like trying to read cursive from a cerebral palsy sufferer.Do you even care about your work anymore?As for the three writers (and one who wisely wanted to remain uncredited) who put this masterpiece of gratuitous violence, cursing, and aimless wandering together, if you guys can call yourselves writers, then the guy who decided to put ""Famously Fresh"" on the top of Planter Cashews Nuts can call himself a writer. Why did you put the psychic woman in the film! You guys must have smoked some crack after you wrote yourself into a corner. Have you ever heard of continuity? Well, maybe having the little girl at the beginning and at the end of the movie was an effort at that. Good Job on that one boys! You confused most of your audience again b/c the girl has no significant meaning to Seagal's character except that she is in the film for him to hug. Or maybe you were just trying to tell me that he is a deadbeat dad/friend/uncle (who is she?) who only cares about this girl in a superficial way. I'll buy it then. Nevertheless, when you write another script, here's a hint about the whole girl signifying a return to family/normal life thing: have Seagal call her/look at a picture of her when he's alone/bring her up in a conversation.

While I praise Seagal for keeping the movies coming, I can't praise the excitement level of his newer films.  The age and weight of Seagal I guess is catching up with him, and therefore his level of skill in the martial arts department is diminishing.  While he still kicks butt and keeps the bone-breaking alive, there is no skill to it in this movie.The story in Today You Die is nothing exciting either.  The Seagal character is set up and set to prison.  He escapes with the help of an inmate.  The two become partners and get revenge for the guys who sent the Seagal character up.  There is a twist with one of the chracters in the film, the only interesting part, but nothing that you  may not have already seen coming.  The lack of story requires more action than this movie provides.  While scenes seem to cange often, attempting at keeping pacing strong, it still fails to heighten our most entertaining movie senses.The bright spot of the movie is Vegas.  If you love Vegas there are plenty of clips of the city, during the day and during the night.  Perhaps the only good spot of the movie is after the first 15 minutes of thie film, there is a decent car chase scene through downtown at night.  You don't get many movies for a chase through Vegas, and this is pretty much the only reason for buying this dvd.This movie turns out to be only good for watching the first time, just to see what happens.

As I did with Out for a Kill, I've given Today You Die two stars. I've reserved 1 star for the Patriot and Submerged. I give TYD an extra star for the Las Vegas chase scene, somewhat coherent plot, and glimpses of Seagal doing Aikido. If I could I would downgrade TYD to 1.5 stars because of the hokey vision woman/girlfriend. She and her visions (seemingly totaly unrelated to the plot) became annoying after a while! On a different note my wife and I found it odd that Seagal was the only one wearing an oversized (obviously to hide his girh) jean jacket while in prison.

921134,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B000A5043S,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[4, 4]","Ironic: About twelve minutes into the film, Steven Seagal asks one of the film's villains ""Do I look sleepy?"" Not a minute later, his girlfriend asks him ""Why are you whispering?""Feel free to chuckle.Seagal's 22nd action feature stars him as a virtuous thief who steals from rich criminals to give to the poor. Upon the urging of his pseudo-psychic girlfriend (Mari Morrow,Nikita Blues), he tries to go clean and takes a truck-driving job from a shady fellow (Kevin Tighe,What's Eating Gilbert Grape) but is double-crossed when it turns out that the job is a heist. Sent to prison, he quickly buddies up with inmate Ice Kool (Anthony ""Treach"" Criss,Love and a Bullet), breaks out, and pursues his turncoat-of-a-boss amidst a scene of police corruption.As bad as Steven Seagal's DTV outings have been, ""Today You Die"" is a surprisingly decent bit of action that, at times, reminded me of the fun-yet-brainless '80s-'90s action flicks of yesterday. Of course, there is no way to turn back the hands of time and yes, Seagal still looks overweight, there is some dubbing of his voice, and the extended storyline - with its truly useless ghost-story tangents and plotholes - are silly enough to kill off a few brain cells. But while ""Today"" doesn't matchUrban Justicefor style, it's better than the likes ofThe ForeignerorAttack Forceby leaps and bounds for choosing to focus on fun rather than pretending to be intelligent. The best example of this is probably the car chase near the beginning of the film: though it steals footage fromTop of the World, it's fast-paced, exciting, well-shot, and has a few one-liners thrown in for good measure to make it one of the best classical adrenaline scenes Seagal had been involved in for a while. In addition, the handful of fight scenes and shootouts are satisfactory as well. Seagal vs. bodyguards near the beginning of the movie and the gang confrontation close to the end are particularly attention-worthy.The supporting cast also works well: the aforementioned names are alert and add to the plot, with Treach being my personal favorite of the rappers-turned-costars Seagal has had. Sarah Buxton (Devil's Highway) and Nick Mancuso (returning from bothUnder Siegemovies) also do well as respective good & bad cops. Again, the messiness of some of the subplots have real potential to drag the movie down for untolerant fans: few examples better showcase the convoluted writing process of Seagal's DTV pictures as the inclusion of this movie's spiritual/magic concept that has absolutely no relevance to the story and goes absolutely nowhere...but if you're willing to take the overall decency of this picture with a grain of salt, it can be an interesting addition rather than a maddening distraction. Fans thirsty enough for something halfway serviceable from the man's DTV career should find ""Today You Die"" a passably enjoyable bit of violent fluff.",3,A Good Day Nonetheless,1211068800,"05 18, 2008",2008,2894,"['Ironic', 'twelve', 'minutes', 'film', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'one', 'film', 'villains', 'Do', 'look', 'sleepy', 'Not', 'minute', 'later', 'girlfriend', 'Why', 'are', 'whispering', 'Feel', 'free', 'chuckle.Seagal', '22nd', 'action', 'feature', 'virtuous', 'thief', 'who', 'rich', 'criminals', 'give', 'poor', 'urging', 'pseudo-psychic', 'girlfriend', 'Mari', 'Morrow', 'Nikita', 'Blues', 'go', 'clean', 'truck-driving', 'job', 'shady', 'fellow', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'What', 'Eating', 'Gilbert', 'Grape', 'double-crossed', 'when', 'out', 'job', 'heist', 'Sent', 'prison', 'quickly', 'up', 'inmate', 'Ice', 'Kool', 'Anthony', 'Treach', 'Criss', 'Love', 'Bullet', 'out', 'turncoat-of-a-boss', 'amidst', 'scene', 'police', 'corruption.As', 'bad', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'DTV', 'outings', 'have', 'been', 'Today', 'Die', 'surprisingly', 'decent', 'bit', 'action', 'times', 'reminded', 'fun-yet-brainless', ""'80s-'90s"", 'action', 'flicks', 'yesterday', 'course', 'way', 'turn', 'back', 'hands', 'time', 'yes', 'Seagal', 'still', 'overweight', 'dubbing', 'voice', 'extended', 'storyline', 'truly', 'useless', 'ghost-story', 'tangents', 'plotholes', 'are', 'silly', 'enough', 'kill', 'off', 'few', 'brain', 'cells', 'Today', ""n't"", 'matchUrban', 'Justicefor', 'style', 'better', 'likes', 'ofThe', 'ForeignerorAttack', 'Forceby', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'choosing', 'focus', 'fun', 'rather', 'pretending', 'be', 'intelligent', 'best', 'example', 'probably', 'car', 'chase', 'beginning', 'film', 'footage', 'fromTop', 'World', 'fast-paced', 'exciting', 'well-shot', 'few', 'one-liners', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'make', 'one', 'best', 'classical', 'adrenaline', 'scenes', 'Seagal', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'while', 'addition', 'handful', 'fight', 'scenes', 'shootouts', 'are', 'satisfactory', 'well', 'Seagal', 'bodyguards', 'beginning', 'movie', 'gang', 'confrontation', 'close', 'end', 'are', 'particularly', 'attention-worthy.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'well', 'aforementioned', 'names', 'are', 'alert', 'add', 'plot', 'Treach', 'being', 'personal', 'favorite', 'rappers-turned-costars', 'Seagal', 'had', 'Sarah', 'Buxton', 'Devil', 'Highway', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'returning', 'bothUnder', 'Siegemovies', 'also', 'do', 'well', 'respective', 'good', 'bad', 'cops', 'Again', 'messiness', 'subplots', 'have', 'real', 'potential', 'drag', 'movie', 'down', 'untolerant', 'fans', 'few', 'examples', 'better', 'showcase', 'convoluted', 'writing', 'process', 'Seagal', 'DTV', 'inclusion', 'movie', 'spiritual/magic', 'concept', 'absolutely', 'relevance', 'story', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', ""'re"", 'willing', 'take', 'overall', 'decency', 'picture', 'grain', 'salt', 'can', 'be', 'interesting', 'addition', 'rather', 'maddening', 'distraction', 'Fans', 'thirsty', 'enough', 'something', 'halfway', 'serviceable', 'man', 'DTV', 'career', 'should', 'find', 'Today', 'Die', 'passably', 'enjoyable', 'bit', 'violent', 'fluff']",Today You Die

The movie is again handicapped in the same manner as Into The Sun and Submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be Seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene. It's as if the camera is turned on and Seagal makes it up as he goes along, conversations involving Seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand. In Seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give Seagal an ego boast. ""Walks like a Black man, breaths like a killer"", what was that all about??The main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of The Order with Van Damme is used as the opening scenes in this. I also think though I might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the Wesley Snipes movie Undisputed.Seagals body double is ever present as usual, Seagals line delivery at times is terrible, yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story, Seagal love scene!, fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with Seagal movies of late.However it's not all bad, this is a big step up from Submerged, there is no voice dubbing, there are flashes of the old Seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all Seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings. For me, it was worth the rental as it's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it.In Seagal's post Exit Wounds DTV years, for me Belly Of The Beast is the mark to aim for and the only one up to and including this one to be recommended.

This film stole the basic plot principle from Redline that maybe if the audiance is confused enough, they won't realize we shot this movie with recycled footage, a few thousand bucks, and no permits. Then, they wanted to name the film, ""You Talk Too Much,"" but they couldn't get the naming rights from the almightyDeath Ring. Rumor has it that the sticking point on that was Seagal wouldn't pony up the cash to buy Chad McQueen a rhinestone studded leather vest with ""Chad"" adorning the back. Oh well.Honestly, Sid wouldn't be able to give a coherent summary of the plot for this one. That could be because there was no plot. Or, more likely, Seagal messed this one up real bad. Let us explain: It is widely known that the producers of this film sued Seagal for showing up eggregiously late for filming and changing the script on the fly. Sid's theory is that Seagal concocted a brilliant plot for the flick, but his wonderful ideas didn't across because he was trying to dispense them to the rest of this wonderful cast through mouthfuls of his ever-present White Castle Crave Case and quart of Wild Turkey. This movie was so great that it would be covered in the first week of Action B 101 at Sid the Elf University.

Does Seagal fight him and show him who's still got it?  Nope, he shoots him.  Probably actually a little worried this guy would have creamed him.  The addition of Treach makes this look like an attempt to be a poor man's Lethal Weapon type buddy movie, but the chemistry is crap.  Then again, does Seagal have good onscreen chemistry with anyone?  There's also a little supernatural/psychic mumbo jumbo thrown in for the hell of it even though it adds absolute zero to the plot.  While this one is better than some of his recent films, it's still typical direct to dvd Seagal.  I just get a strange enjoyment out of these movies.  While renting this film I told the clerk at the video store that I don't know why I continue to torture myself with these Seagal films.  He said, ""Well, at least you know what to expect"".  That pretty much sums up the review of this film:  If you're familiar with Seagal flicks, you pretty much know what to expect from this one.",3,Steven Of Locksley,1126915200,"09 17, 2005",2005,1934,"['Ol', 'Slabface', 'back', 'action', 'taking', 'prisoners', 'not', 'daddy-o', 'time', 'present', 'day', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'who', 'steals', 'drug', 'dealers', 'give', 'poor', 'people', 'help', 're-open', 'closing', 'childrens', 'clinics', 'just', 'bring', 'tear', 'viewer', 'eye', 'Once', 'get', 'legit', 'job', 'naturally', 'hell', 'doublecrossed', 'thrown', 'slammer', 'prison', 'up', 'Treach', 'words', 'Thin', 'Lizzy', 'Tonight', 'gon', 'be', 'jailbreak', 'Once', 'prison', 'hellbent', 'revenge', 'problem', 'annihilating', 'everyone', 'path', 'help', 'new', 'partner', 'Once', 'again', 'body', 'doubles', 'fast/slow/start/stop', 'camera', 'tricks', 'good', 'ol', 'elbow', 'grease', 'are', 'Seagal', 'best', 'friends', 'get', 'newest', 'direct', 'dvd', 'flick', 'man', 'not', 'ready', 'throw', 'towel', 'dwindling', 'martial', 'arts', 'ability', 'yet', 'What', 'Slabface', 'do', 'when', 'confronted', 'only', 'guy', 'film', 'who', 'martial', 'arts', 'training', 'Does', 'Seagal', 'fight', 'show', 'who', 'still', 'got', 'Nope', 'shoots', 'Probably', 'actually', 'little', 'worried', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'creamed', 'addition', 'Treach', 'look', 'attempt', 'be', 'poor', 'man', 'Lethal', 'Weapon', 'type', 'buddy', 'movie', 'chemistry', 'crap', 'Then', 'again', 'Seagal', 'have', 'good', 'onscreen', 'chemistry', 'anyone', 'also', 'little', 'supernatural/psychic', 'mumbo', 'jumbo', 'thrown', 'hell', 'even', 'absolute', 'zero', 'plot', 'one', 'better', 'recent', 'films', 'still', 'typical', 'direct', 'dvd', 'Seagal', 'just', 'get', 'strange', 'enjoyment', 'movies', 'renting', 'film', 'told', 'clerk', 'video', 'store', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'continue', 'torture', 'Seagal', 'films', 'said', 'Well', 'least', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'review', 'film', ""'re"", 'familiar', 'Seagal', 'flicks', 'pretty', 'much', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'one']",Today You Die

921145,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B000A5043S,trebe,"[1, 1]","Today You Die (2005) is a crime thriller set mostly in Nevada, and features action star Steven Seagal as man looking to turn his life around, but instead finds himself the pawn in a criminal conspiracy.  While low on the credibility scale, this is still an entertaining direct to video release.Seagal is Harlan Banks, a criminal type who arrives in Las Vegas, with his girlfriend Jada (Mari Morrow), looking to get a fresh start.  A man named Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) sets Banks up with job driving an armored car.  While making a pickup of cash, Banks' partner Bruno (Robert Miano), guns down some security guards, and forces Banks to take off, with the cops giving chase.The money disappears, and Banks claims to have lost his memory, when questioned by agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Burton), and agent Saunders (Nick Mancuso).  Banks ends up in prison, and does a favor for a con named Ice Kool (Anthony `Treach' Criss).  In return, Kool allows Banks to join him in his escape attempt, flying out of the prison in a helicopter.  Banks and Ice Kool team up to find Max Stevens, and hopefully the missing cash.As in previous films, Seagal is doing the interracial buddy thing again.  Seagal and Treach don't quite make the ideal pair, but they get on well enough, enjoying several fascinating discussions together.  The dialog tries to be hip, but is pretty awful.  Unfortunately Las Vegas isn't featured to very good effect, as more time is spent in behind bars in prison.  Seagal has really bad haircut, and is doubled in his hand to hand fights.  The first of several Seagal features directed by Don E. Faunt LeRoy, the film brings in a number of subplots, like rival gangs, corruption, philosophical baddies, psychic visions and altruism.  It is a confusing mix that doesn't quite gel, but the end result is people getting shot up, and things exploding, on the way to Banks and his pals skirting a murder rap, and living it up on the stolen money.",2,"just a driver, and an interpreter of dreams . . .",1275782400,"06 6, 2010",2010,1951,"['Today', 'Die', '2005', 'crime', 'thriller', 'set', 'mostly', 'Nevada', 'action', 'star', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'man', 'looking', 'turn', 'life', 'around', 'instead', 'pawn', 'criminal', 'conspiracy', 'low', 'credibility', 'scale', 'still', 'entertaining', 'direct', 'video', 'release.Seagal', 'Harlan', 'Banks', 'criminal', 'type', 'who', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'girlfriend', 'Jada', 'Mari', 'Morrow', 'looking', 'get', 'fresh', 'start', 'man', 'named', 'Max', 'Stevens', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'Banks', 'up', 'job', 'driving', 'armored', 'car', 'making', 'pickup', 'cash', 'Banks', 'partner', 'Bruno', 'Robert', 'Miano', 'down', 'security', 'guards', 'forces', 'Banks', 'take', 'off', 'cops', 'giving', 'chase.The', 'money', 'disappears', 'Banks', 'claims', 'have', 'lost', 'memory', 'when', 'questioned', 'agent', 'Rachel', 'Knowles', 'Sarah', 'Burton', 'agent', 'Saunders', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'Banks', 'up', 'prison', 'favor', 'con', 'named', 'Ice', 'Kool', 'Anthony', 'Treach', 'Criss', 'return', 'Kool', 'Banks', 'join', 'escape', 'attempt', 'flying', 'prison', 'helicopter', 'Banks', 'Ice', 'Kool', 'team', 'up', 'find', 'Max', 'Stevens', 'hopefully', 'missing', 'cash.As', 'previous', 'films', 'Seagal', 'doing', 'interracial', 'buddy', 'thing', 'again', 'Seagal', 'Treach', 'do', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'ideal', 'pair', 'get', 'well', 'enough', 'enjoying', 'several', 'fascinating', 'discussions', 'together', 'dialog', 'be', 'hip', 'pretty', 'awful', 'Unfortunately', 'Las', 'Vegas', ""n't"", 'featured', 'very', 'good', 'effect', 'more', 'time', 'spent', 'behind', 'bars', 'prison', 'Seagal', 'really', 'bad', 'haircut', 'doubled', 'hand', 'hand', 'fights', 'first', 'several', 'Seagal', 'features', 'directed', 'Don', 'E.', 'Faunt', 'LeRoy', 'film', 'number', 'subplots', 'rival', 'gangs', 'corruption', 'philosophical', 'baddies', 'psychic', 'visions', 'altruism', 'confusing', 'mix', ""n't"", 'quite', 'gel', 'end', 'result', 'people', 'getting', 'shot', 'up', 'things', 'exploding', 'way', 'Banks', 'pals', 'skirting', 'murder', 'rap', 'living', 'up', 'stolen', 'money']",Today You Die

Not so amazing, however, if you see `Today You Die' dreadful film with a dreadful title. The press material I managed to get at Japanese theater in Osaka (yes, they dared to release it theatrically in Japan) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days. Small wonder that none of the film makes sense, gives less actions than awful dialogues.Steven Seagal plays one Harlan Banks, ex-master thief who is retiring from his job. Banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in Las Vegas, but because of the robbery committed by someone else, he is arrested and sent to a jail. Is he framed? Of course, he is, but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail, and meets and enlists a help from someone named Ice Kool there (played by Treach), there is nothing to worry about.But I had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film. We see a glimpse of one orphanage (briefly twice), but no one in the film seems to remember it. The film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of Harlan sees (played by Mari Morrow) in her dream that portends death and danger, but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film. There is a detective played by Sarah Buxton, whose motive to get close to Banks remains unclear, and Nick Mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as Agent Saunders.[DULL, DULL, DULL] The most impressive part of `Today You Die' is one car chase scene in Las Vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork. In fact, these scenes are recycled footages from one Sidney J. Furie actioner `Top Of the World' starring Peter Weller and Dennis Hopper (yes, I checked it yesterday). The rest of `Today You Die' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between Seagal's character and others, which goes like:BODYGUARD: ""Who are you?!""SEAGAL: `Girl scout of America.'Naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by Seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket, who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening-speed editing and body doubles, which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `Above the Law.'The film is strictly for the avid fans of Seagal, but I am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year. I like his films in the 80s and 90s, and I admit `Today You Die' is not as bad as `The Foreigner,' but that isn't saying much.",1,Career Death: Dull Action and Dreadful Mess,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,2510,"['Steven', 'Seagal', 'making', 'films', '2005', 'alone', 'made', 'as', 'many', 'four', 'films', 'amazing', 'feat', 'Not', 'so', 'amazing', 'however', 'see', 'Today', 'Die', 'dreadful', 'film', 'dreadful', 'title', 'press', 'material', 'managed', 'get', 'Japanese', 'theater', 'Osaka', 'yes', 'dared', 'release', 'theatrically', 'Japan', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'only', '18', 'days', 'Small', 'wonder', 'none', 'film', 'sense', 'less', 'actions', 'awful', 'dialogues.Steven', 'Seagal', 'one', 'Harlan', 'Banks', 'ex-master', 'thief', 'who', 'retiring', 'job', 'Banks', 'professional', 'driver', 'cash', 'delivery', 'van', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'robbery', 'committed', 'someone', 'else', 'arrested', 'sent', 'jail', 'framed', 'course', 'when', 'can', 'wear', 'trademark', 'long', 'jacket', 'jail', 'meets', 'help', 'someone', 'named', 'Ice', 'Kool', 'played', 'Treach', 'nothing', 'worry', 'about.But', 'had', 'worry', 'nothing', 'sense', 'film', 'see', 'glimpse', 'one', 'orphanage', 'briefly', 'twice', 'one', 'film', 'remember', 'film', 'cheesy', 'nightmare', 'sequence', 'girlfriend', 'Harlan', 'sees', 'played', 'Mari', 'Morrow', 'dream', 'death', 'danger', 'supernatural', 'idea', 'just', 'dropped', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'detective', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Buxton', 'motive', 'get', 'close', 'Banks', 'unclear', 'Nick', 'Mancuso', 'confusion', 'already', 'chaotic', 'scenario', 'Agent', 'Saunders', 'DULL', 'DULL', 'DULL', 'most', 'impressive', 'part', 'Today', 'Die', 'one', 'car', 'chase', 'scene', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'decent', 'stunts', 'nice', 'camerawork', 'fact', 'scenes', 'are', 'recycled', 'footages', 'one', 'Sidney', 'J.', 'Furie', 'actioner', 'Top', 'World', 'starring', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'yes', 'checked', 'yesterday', 'rest', 'Today', 'Die', 'mainly', 'terribly', 'witless', 'dialogues', 'exchanged', 'Seagal', 'character', 'others', 'BODYGUARD', 'Who', 'are', 'SEAGAL', 'Girl', 'scout', 'America', ""'Naturally"", 'poor', 'bodyguard', 'beaten', 'up', 'Seagal', 'clad', 'ridiculously', 'long', 'jacket', 'who', 'minimum', 'energy', 'helped', 'lightening-speed', 'editing', 'body', 'doubles', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'not', 'willing', 'do', 'actions', 'had', 'shown', 'films', 'Law', 'film', 'strictly', 'avid', 'fans', 'Seagal', 'am', 'afraid', 'number', 'getting', 'smaller', 'year', 'films', '80s', '90s', 'admit', 'Today', 'Die', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'Foreigner', ""n't"", 'saying', 'much']",Today You Die

I'm still spitting the sour taste from my mouth.  I couldn't even get thru the first two and clenched my teeth to get thru Today You Die.  Why, oh why does he use stunt doubles for such simple things?  Were these snippets filmed after he left the set for the day so the double was used?  Even if he is getting too old for this stuff, anyone can choreograph these types of moves fairly convincingly.  Hell, The Duke and Bronson continued their own fistfights well into their 70's and even 80's for Bronson. (check out Hard Times to see Bronson in multiple extended and very convinving fistfights without the use of a stunt double and with his shirt off at the age of 54)Now I own and can enjoy the likes of what some say are Seagals  worst - Fire Down Below, On Deadly Ground, and Half Past Dead - and I even found I found the Foriegner an okay watch, but Today You Die, Out for a Kill, and Submerged are altogether garbage and unwatchable.
