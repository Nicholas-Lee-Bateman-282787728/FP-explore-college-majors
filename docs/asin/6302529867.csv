This movie is about to boring characters, (one who is an uptight snoozer, and the other a typical party boy) who argue about climbing a lousy mountain for half of the duration of the film. There are some useless and boring conflicts about one guy's wife not wanting him to go, and the other guy is a loser and has nothing better to do.If the ending was anything fun to talk about I would love to spoil the ending for you, but I found myself hoping they both die a horrible death up on the mountain.

318903,A29ZEV20RCXV1D,6302529867,"Anthony J. Lomenzo ""Doc Tony""","[2, 3]","I'm motivated to write this review well after the fact of the movie's initial release [1991 in Europe and then May of 1992 in the USA] and subsequent DVD release in 2001 because K2 is again in the news with the most recent tragedy of 11 climbers being killed on K2 which occurred on August 1, 2008.My thrust however is to once again caution at least certain viewers that while K2 is in fact dedicated [superimposed on the screen in the closing scene] to real life K2 summiteers, Jim Wickwire and Dr. Louis Reichardt, and, of note, those movie 'fictional' characters 'Taylor Brooks' and 'Harold Jameson' who just happen to share the identical professions of the real-life Jim Wickwire and Lou Reichardt, viz., lawyer and biophysicist, well, far too often what is seen on the proverbial 'Silver Screen' is erroneously interpreted as take-it-to-the-bank 'fact' versus cinematic 'for the sake of the script and pure entertainment value' fiction!Put another way, readers are urged to research the actual 1978 K2 climb by, among further others by the way in the same expedition, Jim Wickwire and Lou Reichardt and see what the actual facts really were and are, versus, shall we say, Hollywood creativity. I 'have' actually run across folks who saw the movie and make the transposition, so to speak, of 'Taylor' suddenly becoming Jim Wickwire and 'Harold' or 'H' suddenly becoming Lou Reichardt in their minds and hence their post-movie ""conclusion"" is that their totally erroneous transposition sees Wickwire supposedly having 'saved Reichardt's life' [!] when Reichardt supposedly 'broke his leg' [!] on the vertical ice fall and Wickwire supposedly 'dragged Reichardt down the mountain as far as he could until the Pakistani helicopter suddenly showed up' [!] -- BIZZZZ! That is total cinematic fantasy! But 'because' of the film dedication and a few minor events that did happen in real life, it's all too easy for some folks to see the movie and feel that it's a sort of 'true event' documentary when in fact the movie is just that, a movie based on 'conjured' events!That said, I enjoyed the movie. As a fictional movie! Particularly the music! Although my first love is playing classical piano, I've never abandoned my secondary love of the guitar and those high E string lead tones [I don't know who the guitarist was and if anyone does, let me know!] are literally haunting! BTW, the soundtrack that is offered for this movie is ==NOT== the same music in the film! Nor is it 'identical', as one poster suggested in another website, to what he termed a ""Pink Floyd rip off"" piece. The 'original' music for the K2 movie was by Chaz Jankel and has 'not' been released for whatever unknown reasons!Final word on the whole, as one Amazon reviewer put it, ""brotherhood of the rope"" [sic], well, let me quote well known and world class mountaineer, Doc Ed Viesturs, from his ""No Shortcuts to the Top"" [with David Roberts] tome [, 2006], page 37, when he rightly says, and my own noting of those 'lines' and 'bottlenecks' of climbers at Everest, K2, et al, where 'some' of these folks have very deep pockets but negligible mountaineering experience come out with, 'Ohhh, it's just a personal challenge ... and it's not like I'm all alone ...', but as Doc Viesturs realistically observes, ""The fact is, money can't buy you a summit.""

I agree with other posters here about the picture quality, presumably due to the ""pan and scan"" technology used.  Not my expertise, but the quality is noticeably bad.  Nonetheless, the shots are still amazing and as others have mentioned some of the climbing sequences are incredible, particularly the opening one.I like the storyline.  The conflicts and struggles all seem authentic.  The acting was excellent for the most part.  The worst part of the movie for me is the soundtrack which I wish were a little more subtle in certain parts.  At some points it's fine.  The synths sound a little dated but it doesn't ruin the film.  I think a documentary would better serve the material in terms of trying to understand what drives people to participate in such a dangerous pursuit when the payoff seems quite trivial, but whatever.

They really pulled it together on this one and made a visually inspiring rendition of a mountain climbing story.

His headstrong arrogant character is done well and he fits his role well.Harold and Taylor are the odd couple, but on another level they are true friends.  The story is about bickering characters trying to function for a common goal.  Sometimes it is painful.

It is based loosely on Lou Reichart and Jim Whitacker who were among the first four Americans to climb K2-probably the world's most difficult mountain.  The story is woven around the contrast and conflict between the two friends, one apparently being primarily self-oriented and the other believing in the importance of interpersonal responsibility.  The climbing is a useful vehicle because it makes plausible that a close relationship between two such dissimilar people could exist.  The mentality and mechanics of big mountain climbing are well depicted as the film moves to a resolution of its central issue.  The acting is competent and the depiction of the mountain climbing is excellent.  This movie is better than the obscurity into which it has sunken.

It was shown for the first time on Lithuanian television, apparently because of the recent ""alpine fever"" that has swept the country, with Lithuanians traveling far and wide to find mountains high enough to fulfill their adrenaline rush.The movie itself seems aimed exclusively at young adolescents, making up for its lugubrious pace with enough literal cliffhanging scenes to keep you involved.  There is the sole woman to play into the female audience, despite this being essentially a guy-bonding movie.  Our intrepid pair, Taylor and Harold, finally get their chance to scale the peak of K2 thanks to the deaths of two more of Phillip Claiborne's men, barely surviving the downhill climb themselves.I have to say that some of the scenes are breathtaking, as the cumbersome climbing team makes its way up K2, but all the close-up shots were obviously studio sets, ruining any realistic sense of the event taking place.

318914,A2A7XY78RAM5H5,6302529867,"Karl E. Weaver ""karlweaver""","[6, 7]","K2 is not the world's tallest mountain (as everyone knows, Mt. Everest is) but it is the world's deadliest.  It is the second-tallest mountain but climbing it is far more challenging than climbing Mt. Everest.  It has the most deaths of any 8000+ metre mountain in the world.  The fatality rate of climbers attempting to summit K2 is about 50%.  As of early 2004 only 198 people had summited K2, while over 1700 have summited Mt. Everest.This movie is about an attempt to summit K2.  I've read the other reviews of this movie and I'd like to stress a few additional points.  First, this is the best movie I've ever seen about high-altitude mountain climbing.  Second, while the characters are ""fictional"", they are actually based on real-life mountaineers.  Those who know the history of high-altitude climbing will recognize some of the real-life characters reflected in the movie.  Third, while the story is not strictly true, it is in fact a composite of various actual events that have occurred over a number of summit attempts.  The events as depicted are very realistic, and give the armchair viewer some sense of what it must be like to tackle one of the world's greatest physical challenges.This is more than just a ""guy-buddie"" movie.  It's more than just an adventure movie.  It's more than a semi-documentary about high-altitude climbing.  It says something about why we humans, or some of us, strive for almost-impossible, ""crazy"" accomplishments.  It portrays the characters realistically, with their strengths and their weaknesses.

318916,A1L43KWWR05PCS,6302529867,Lawyeraau,"[12, 15]","This is essentially a buddy movie clothed in mountaineering garb. It is a story about two climbers: one, a Seattle based attorney, the other, a physics instructor. They are a mismatched pair of friends who are brought together because of their love for climbing. The story line is about the ultimate test that their friendship endures while high on K2, the second highest mountain in the world but the most perilous to climb.The rock climbing scenes that take place in the first fifteen minutes of the movie are terrific to watch, even though they may not be technically correct. After all, it's a movie, not a documentary. The scenery is spectacular and the cinematography is excellent.These friends decide to grab an opportunity to climb K2 with an expedition that lost two of its team members to an avalanche on Denali. The attorney has no problem going to K2, but the physics instructor leaves behind his weeping wife and child. Yet his friendship with the attorney and his own desire to climb K2 compel him to leave his distraught family.There are a number of scenes in the movie that seem to be taken from real life. While on expedition to K2, the porters leave them stranded, refusing to go any further on the mountain, as they have portents of doom. They also want more money. One scene has the attorney burning rupees in defiance of the porters' strike. World class mountaineer Jim Wickwire did the same thing, when he climbed K2, and under similar circumstances.In another scene, a number of climbers fall into a crevasse only to be saved at the last minute by the physics instructor, as he digs his ice axes in and grips the road. The film also include a scene that shows the expedition leader succumbing to high altitude sickness, necessitating his descent of K2 as soon as possible.Animosity on the mountain between the climbing leader and the attorney over who will be part of the first summit team is also reminiscent of real life expeditions. It is here that the attorney's friendship with the physics instructor becomes strained, as he lays claim to be on the first summit team and does not include his friend, even though they had been climbing partners for ten years. So much for the brotherhood of the rope.After the first summit team is finished off by the mountain, the two friends summit, but on the descent the physics instructor falls and is seriously injured, breaking his leg. As you can imagine, this is really bad news, as it is tantamount to a death sentence, especially when you are in the death zone and without oxygen.Since this is a buddy movie, the attorney comes up with a plan to get his friend down K2. I won't tell you what it is, but I will give you a hint. The plan used is to be found in Joe Simpson's book ""Touching the Void"".Interestingly enough, the movie is dedicated to two mountaineers of renown: Seattle attorney, Jim Wickwire, and physicist, Lou Reichardt, both of whom were among the first Americans to summit K2 in 1978. This film seems to be loosely based upon some of their mountaineering exploits. It is a moderately enjoyable film that should appeal to armchair climbing enthusiasts everywhere.",3,DECENT ADVENTURE STORY FOR ARMCHAIR CLIMBERS...,973468800,"11 6, 2000",2000,3150,"['essentially', 'buddy', 'movie', 'clothed', 'mountaineering', 'garb', 'story', 'two', 'climbers', 'one', 'Seattle', 'based', 'attorney', 'other', 'physics', 'instructor', 'are', 'mismatched', 'pair', 'friends', 'who', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'love', 'climbing', 'story', 'line', 'ultimate', 'test', 'friendship', 'endures', 'while', 'high', 'K2', 'second', 'highest', 'mountain', 'world', 'most', 'perilous', 'climb.The', 'rock', 'climbing', 'scenes', 'take', 'place', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'terrific', 'watch', 'even', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'technically', 'correct', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'scenery', 'spectacular', 'cinematography', 'excellent.These', 'friends', 'decide', 'grab', 'opportunity', 'climb', 'K2', 'expedition', 'lost', 'two', 'team', 'members', 'avalanche', 'Denali', 'attorney', 'problem', 'going', 'K2', 'physics', 'instructor', 'weeping', 'wife', 'child', 'friendship', 'attorney', 'own', 'desire', 'climb', 'K2', 'compel', 'leave', 'distraught', 'are', 'number', 'scenes', 'movie', 'seem', 'be', 'taken', 'real', 'life', 'expedition', 'K2', 'porters', 'leave', 'stranded', 'refusing', 'go', 'further', 'mountain', 'have', 'portents', 'doom', 'also', 'want', 'more', 'money', 'One', 'scene', 'attorney', 'burning', 'rupees', 'defiance', 'porters', 'strike', 'World', 'class', 'mountaineer', 'Jim', 'Wickwire', 'did', 'same', 'thing', 'when', 'climbed', 'K2', 'similar', 'circumstances.In', 'scene', 'number', 'climbers', 'fall', 'crevasse', 'only', 'be', 'saved', 'last', 'minute', 'physics', 'instructor', 'ice', 'axes', 'grips', 'road', 'film', 'also', 'include', 'scene', 'expedition', 'leader', 'succumbing', 'high', 'altitude', 'sickness', 'necessitating', 'descent', 'K2', 'as', 'soon', 'possible.Animosity', 'mountain', 'climbing', 'leader', 'attorney', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'part', 'first', 'summit', 'team', 'also', 'reminiscent', 'real', 'life', 'expeditions', 'here', 'attorney', 'friendship', 'physics', 'instructor', 'becomes', 'strained', 'claim', 'be', 'first', 'summit', 'team', 'not', 'include', 'friend', 'even', 'had', 'been', 'climbing', 'partners', 'ten', 'years', 'So', 'much', 'brotherhood', 'rope.After', 'first', 'summit', 'team', 'finished', 'off', 'mountain', 'two', 'friends', 'summit', 'descent', 'physics', 'instructor', 'falls', 'seriously', 'injured', 'breaking', 'leg', 'can', 'imagine', 'really', 'bad', 'news', 'tantamount', 'death', 'sentence', 'especially', 'when', 'are', 'death', 'zone', 'oxygen.Since', 'buddy', 'movie', 'attorney', 'up', 'plan', 'get', 'friend', 'down', 'K2', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'what', 'will', 'give', 'hint', 'plan', 'used', 'be', 'found', 'Joe', 'Simpson', 'book', 'Touching', 'Void', '.Interestingly', 'enough', 'movie', 'dedicated', 'two', 'mountaineers', 'renown', 'Seattle', 'attorney', 'Jim', 'Wickwire', 'physicist', 'Lou', 'Reichardt', 'whom', 'were', 'first', 'Americans', 'summit', 'K2', '1978', 'film', 'be', 'loosely', 'based', 'mountaineering', 'exploits', 'moderately', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'should', 'appeal', 'armchair', 'climbing', 'enthusiasts', 'everywhere']",N/A

Michael Biehn and Matt Craven are two professionals from Seattle who join billionaire Raymond J. Barry and his team as they attempt to climb K2, the world's second largest peak. It's simply a story of how the team comes together to conquer the mountain. There is tragedy along the way and a test of personal friendship as the team makes its ascent to the top. It's somewhat remarkable that this Paramount/Miramax co-production of relatively recent vintage (1991) has been relegated to a release through a budget video company. The DVD presentation is extremely disappointing; the film has a soft look. I remember it looking much clearer and crisper in the theater at the time of its initial release. Most unfortunately, this DVD has been released in pan &amp; scan rather than in widescreen; viewers are really being cheated of some outstanding cinematography. Also, the extras are minimal . . . there's a brief synopsis of the film, credits of the principal film makers, and short biographies of the film's two main stars, Michael Biehn and Matt Craven. This is the type of film where a &quot;Making of&quot; featurette would have been a great and welcome addition.
