I have a wiener dog and was excited when I came across this movie. So my famille sat down for a movie night and stared watching. We could not get half way through. It was so poorly written, and the acting was well terrible. The plot of the story is the mother has died recently and one of the kids finds a picture of his mother when she was a child with a Doxie that had won a race. The child has a birthday and he won't a dog like his mother had. So they rescue him one and a rich woman immediately wont's to buy the dog. The movie must have been finance by a fast food chain Wienershnitzel because they are constantly in the restaurant. The father also gets fired from his job working in a gym and replaced by a guy who has a spray that makes you grow muscles without working out. Right? The dog also gets hurt and is holding up her front right leg but they take her to the girls house that signed them up for the race and she raps the back leg. And the father is instantly in love with the girl. We just could not finish watching it.

This film has all the traditional aspects that make for a great children's movie and a few extras.  A little boy and his family are struggling to get by after losing their mother. He finds a picture of his mom when she was a little girl holding a Dachshund she had raced. He decides all he wants for his birthday is the same type of dog his mom loved so much. They adopt a little wiener dog from a shelter and name her Shelly. She has one very special feature. She has a lightning bolt birthmark on her leg.Not long after they get the dog, their is a local race and Shelly makes it to the top three. Soon they have the chance to go to the nationals but there are lots of factors working against them. The father loses his job, they get into trouble for being too friendly with a judge which could get them disqualified, and they have to deal with the nasty reining champions. Competition with the man who stole the dad's job also leaves Shelly with an injury.My kids really enjoyed this film. They liked all the characters and they really loved watching all the dogs race and play. Shelly was adorable even when she was tearing up furniture and she really brought the family together. The ending is a little predictable, but most kid's films are. All in all, my family of six  gives Wiener Dog Nationals a unanimous 5 stars.",5,Family Movie Night,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",2013,1499,"['***Complimentary', 'copy', 'received', 'exchange', 'honest', 'review**If', 'are', 'looking', 'great', 'movie', 'family', 'movie', 'night', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'Wiener', 'Dog', 'Nationals', 'film', 'traditional', 'aspects', 'make', 'great', 'children', 'movie', 'few', 'extras', 'little', 'boy', 'family', 'are', 'struggling', 'get', 'losing', 'mother', 'picture', 'mom', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'holding', 'Dachshund', 'had', 'raced', 'all', 'birthday', 'same', 'type', 'dog', 'mom', 'loved', 'so', 'much', 'adopt', 'little', 'wiener', 'dog', 'shelter', 'name', 'Shelly', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'feature', 'lightning', 'bolt', 'birthmark', 'leg.Not', 'long', 'get', 'dog', 'local', 'race', 'Shelly', 'top', 'three', 'Soon', 'have', 'chance', 'go', 'nationals', 'are', 'lots', 'factors', 'working', 'father', 'job', 'get', 'trouble', 'being', 'too', 'friendly', 'judge', 'could', 'get', 'disqualified', 'have', 'deal', 'nasty', 'reining', 'champions', 'Competition', 'man', 'who', 'stole', 'dad', 'job', 'also', 'Shelly', 'injury.My', 'kids', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'liked', 'characters', 'really', 'loved', 'watching', 'dogs', 'race', 'play', 'Shelly', 'was', 'adorable', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'tearing', 'up', 'furniture', 'really', 'brought', 'family', 'together', 'ending', 'little', 'predictable', 'most', 'kid', 'films', 'are', 'family', 'six', 'Wiener', 'Dog', 'Nationals', 'unanimous', '5', 'stars']",Wiener Dog Nationals

1645124,A2DLKD4AC5JV5Q,B00CA5MAOM,Ranny Levy,"[2, 3]","If you love dogs like me, then you'll love ""Wiener Dog Nationals"". This movie is about a little boy named Danny, that dreams of being like his mom, a champion of the Wiener Dog Nationals. He ends up fulfilling that dream finding out that he can do what he wants do if he sets his mind to it.In this movie, it's Danny's birthday and the one thing he wants for his birthday is a Wiener dog (dachshund). At first, his dad is not too happy about the idea because he knows that taking care of a dog is a lot of responsibility. The dad ends up saying that it's ok to get a dog and they do get a dog. They name her Shelly and she has a very special marking on her hind leg. It's a lightning bolt. Noone really knows what it stands for, but they think that it's cool. Danny enters her into the competition without their dad knowing. They go to the first race and Shelly makes it into the regionals. The problem is that they have to go to Indiana. They tell their dad and he says that they have to take her out of the competition. Then, he realizes that he was wrong and asks to get back into it. There are some problems at first but then she gets back into the Regionals, gets third place and they realize that the owner of the winning dog cheated so she was still in second place. Then the other dog, Handshake, passes the limit of the race. Therefore, Shelly wins the race.The main characters in this movie are Melanie (Alicia Witt), Judge Brown (Bryan Batt), Danny Jack (Julian Feder), Skip Jack (Austin Anderson), Phil Jack (Jason London), and Bridget (Caitlin Carmicheal).What I like about this movie is that Danny loves his dog so much and that he has people there to support him. My favorite part is when Mrs. Merrywhether gets disqualified because she was playing an unfair game and then Shelly wins the race. There are no parts that I dislike because this movie was great and I really loved everything about it.I recommend this movie to ages 5 to 18, to people that love dogs and to people that help each other. Even though you are competing against some one, it doesn't mean that you have to be rude to each other. Reviewed by Valdi B KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.
