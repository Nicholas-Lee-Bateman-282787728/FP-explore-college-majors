Even most of the acting is bad. How this ever got a green light is beyond me, particularly given that, though not a tremendously expensive production by any means, the money spent making it is far above what it deserves.Science Fiction, or in this case Speculative Fiction, has always been a fertile ground for film making. And a lot of guys have figured out how to do it. Even some movies with really wild plots have been able to get the audience to suspend their disbelief. But if a viewer believes any of this they have serious issues.Here's the scoop. The corporations own the world and one of them, ""Hope Industries"", figures that normal advertising is no longer effective and cooks a scheme to plant ads directly into someone's brain via a circuit implant. It's still in the test phase so they're working out the bugs. They stage a car accident with Cuba Gooding Jr. to provide the opportunity to implant the chip in him and the plot takes off from there.He gets help from an outlaw group of rebels intent on bringing Hope Industries to its knees. There are only 4 of them so it's a daunting task to be certain, but they're computer geniuses and can hack and gain all sorts of intel at lightning speeds. And Hope Industries, with it's near limitless resources, seems to have weak spots all over its operations. It's amazing how even low level people in the company, even actors it their commercials, have information pertinent to the company's goings on.That's as far as I'm going there. Just let it be known that this movie is dumb beyond the meaning of the word. All those involved must have led lives devoid of the movie going experience. Now granted, I've seen way too many movies in my life, and I've got more than a few years under my belt, but even someone with way less viewing experience than myself can see that this is simply an inept venture into the genre.Wasn't Cuba Gooding a good actor once upon a time? What happened to him here? And Val Kilmer. On the cover art he looks like the Val of days gone by. In the movie he looks like he crawled out of the bottom of a bottle. Michael Ironside phones in his performance. This is just a wasted effort all the way around.

When he wakes, Luke has little memory concerning himself of his family and heads home.But he's having problems. Luke keeps seeing walking ads in front of him that no one else can. The same image of a man hawking a watch and more keep popping up and Luke finds his grasp on reality in question. He feels compelled to posses the item on display and starts to rob a jewelry store window with the watch in it. As a guard tries to stop him, Luke gets away but not before the police close in. Only more words appearing in the air before him guide him to safety and a meeting with Punk Red (Tatiana Maslany) and Punk Blue (Juan Riedinger).The duo take him to a secret lab where he meets Hal (Michael Ironside), a scientist and father of Keyboard (Chad Krowchuck), a paralyzed genius who once worked for Hexx Corporation. While there, he was involved with an implant device known as a psi-comp implant that would allow Hexx Corp. to project advertising images to the person with the chip, thus explaining Luke's visions. Finding this to be immoral, Keyboard tried to stop it, only to end up in an ""accident"" and tossed aside.Keyboard and his crew explain everything that has happened to Luke and ask him for his help. In return for the attempted retrieval of Luke's memories (wiped out by Hexx Corp.) they want him to kill its founder and top man, Virgil (Val Kilmer). Luke agrees and as his memory comes the team also lets him know just how his accident came to be. Hexx Corp. was responsible for the termination of his insurance as well as the accident that took the life of his wife and unborn child.As Hexx Corporation's attack team closes in on Keyboard and his group, Punk Red and Blue and Luke head out with enough information to destroy Hexx Corp. Now a man on a mission, Luke is determined to bring his own brand of justice to Virgil. But Virgil is not one to go down without a fight.This movie offers a cyber-punk attitude and world view that holds true for the tale. The technology and appearance of the world in which it takes place is believable. And that helps as the story unfolds.The film isn't a mega-budget action flick, but delivers on all counts in its own low budget way. A direct-to-DVD release its one of those films dropped at the DVD rental store's front steps like an unwanted child that then offers a decent flick. The acting is well done and the characters benefit greatly from this. The effects are solid and also play a major role.Face it, this movie is not Shakespeare but it is an entertaining night's rental. You get plenty of action, a heart tugging story and a revenge flick all in one.Your enjoyment of this film will lie in your expectations. Go in expecting Gooding in another Oscar worthy role or Kilmer as Jim Morrison again and you'll walk away disappointed. Go in expecting a low budget action flick with sci fi inspiration and you'll find a nice evening's entertainment. Would I watch it again? Sure. Would I say you need to add it to your collection? Probably not unless you're a fan of any of the stars.",3,AD EXECS GONE OVERBOARD,1268524800,"03 14, 2010",2010,3290,"['Luke', 'Gibson', 'wife', 'start', 'film', 'en', 'route', 'doctor', 'visit', 'child', 'are', 'expected', 'when', 'suddenly', 'are', 'rammed', 'side', 'truck', 'resulting', 'Luke', 'wife', 'unborn', 'child', 'dying', 'Luke', 'heading', 'operating', 'table', 'When', 'Luke', 'little', 'memory', 'concerning', 'family', 'heads', 'home.But', 'having', 'problems', 'Luke', 'seeing', 'walking', 'ads', 'front', 'one', 'else', 'can', 'same', 'image', 'man', 'hawking', 'watch', 'more', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'Luke', 'grasp', 'reality', 'question', 'compelled', 'posses', 'item', 'display', 'rob', 'jewelry', 'store', 'window', 'watch', 'guard', 'stop', 'Luke', 'away', 'not', 'police', 'close', 'Only', 'more', 'words', 'appearing', 'air', 'guide', 'safety', 'meeting', 'Punk', 'Red', 'Tatiana', 'Maslany', 'Punk', 'Blue', 'Juan', 'Riedinger', 'duo', 'take', 'secret', 'lab', 'where', 'Hal', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'scientist', 'father', 'Keyboard', 'Chad', 'Krowchuck', 'paralyzed', 'genius', 'who', 'once', 'worked', 'Hexx', 'Corporation', 'there', 'was', 'involved', 'implant', 'device', 'known', 'psi-comp', 'implant', 'would', 'allow', 'Hexx', 'Corp.', 'project', 'advertising', 'images', 'person', 'chip', 'thus', 'explaining', 'Luke', 'visions', 'Finding', 'be', 'immoral', 'Keyboard', 'tried', 'stop', 'only', 'end', 'up', 'accident', 'tossed', 'aside.Keyboard', 'crew', 'explain', 'everything', 'happened', 'Luke', 'ask', 'help', 'return', 'attempted', 'retrieval', 'Luke', 'memories', 'wiped', 'out', 'Hexx', 'Corp.', 'want', 'kill', 'founder', 'top', 'man', 'Virgil', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'Luke', 'memory', 'team', 'also', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'accident', 'came', 'be', 'Hexx', 'Corp.', 'was', 'responsible', 'termination', 'insurance', 'as', 'well', 'accident', 'took', 'life', 'wife', 'unborn', 'child.As', 'Hexx', 'Corporation', 'attack', 'team', 'Keyboard', 'group', 'Punk', 'Red', 'Blue', 'Luke', 'head', 'out', 'enough', 'information', 'destroy', 'Hexx', 'Corp.', 'Now', 'man', 'mission', 'Luke', 'determined', 'bring', 'own', 'brand', 'justice', 'Virgil', 'Virgil', 'not', 'one', 'go', 'down', 'fight.This', 'movie', 'cyber-punk', 'attitude', 'world', 'view', 'true', 'tale', 'technology', 'appearance', 'world', 'place', 'believable', 'story', 'unfolds.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'mega-budget', 'action', 'flick', 'delivers', 'counts', 'own', 'low', 'budget', 'way', 'direct-to-DVD', 'release', 'one', 'films', 'dropped', 'DVD', 'rental', 'store', 'front', 'steps', 'unwanted', 'child', 'then', 'decent', 'flick', 'acting', 'well', 'done', 'characters', 'benefit', 'greatly', 'effects', 'are', 'solid', 'also', 'play', 'major', 'role.Face', 'movie', 'not', 'Shakespeare', 'entertaining', 'night', 'rental', 'get', 'plenty', 'action', 'heart', 'tugging', 'story', 'revenge', 'flick', 'one.Your', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'will', 'lie', 'expectations', 'Go', 'expecting', 'Gooding', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'role', 'Kilmer', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'again', ""'ll"", 'walk', 'away', 'disappointed', 'Go', 'expecting', 'low', 'budget', 'action', 'flick', 'sci', 'fi', 'inspiration', ""'ll"", 'find', 'nice', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'Would', 'watch', 'again', 'Sure', 'Would', 'say', 'need', 'add', 'collection', 'Probably', 'not', ""'re"", 'fan', 'stars']",N/A

I watched the whole film and the included documentary, and when it was all done - I wholeheartedly recommend skipping the film and to watch the supplement.Cuba fills his role of the hero in a not-so-distant future where corporations control ""everything"". He is given a second chance at living after suffering a brain deadening accident. This new chance is having a chip implanted into his neck that allows him to live again, but with consequences. The bad guys, hilariously led by Val Kilmer (worst hair, worst lines, worst everything for him in years) and the good guys led by Michael Ironside (the only good point here) battle for control of Cuba's brain, coupled with his own fight for his memories. Bad effects and loopy writing make for a weak execution, but I have to give props for them doing the exploding head routine in minute one. All kidding aside, there was really nothing to hold your interest and the sound gets over-saturated in each brain sequence (almost a mix of the Johnny Neumonic and Matrix sounds - but painfully done). The inside-his-head effects are 80s-ish and have a TV look. The picture is decent clarity though and the 5.1 gets utilized often to the outer channels.The supplement is a 17-minute making of that features interviews and adequate behind the scenes for what the film was. Interesting points included the usage of the now defunct Watchmen street set, Cuba being ""moved"" by the script, and the enjoyment by everyone in getting to work with Ironside. The documentary does feel like a fluff piece, but in a better way of making a point than the film was in trying to entertain. One star for the film and one for the supplement. Skipper otherwise.EDIT: Speaking of bad hair...just realized the cover art is not a pic of Val from this film (no trust in what his do looked like in this film to promote sales), best I could tell it looks like it came from Conspiracy, or one of the other 20 films from last year...oh well.",2,"Am being as fair as I can, but not worth it",1257206400,"11 3, 2009",2009,2048,"['once', 'unanimous', 'slander', 'dislike', 'film', 'adequately', 'placed', 'accurate', 'watched', 'whole', 'film', 'included', 'documentary', 'when', 'was', 'done', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'skipping', 'film', 'watch', 'supplement.Cuba', 'role', 'hero', 'not-so-distant', 'future', 'where', 'corporations', 'control', 'everything', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'living', 'suffering', 'brain', 'deadening', 'accident', 'new', 'chance', 'having', 'chip', 'implanted', 'neck', 'live', 'again', 'consequences', 'bad', 'guys', 'hilariously', 'led', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'worst', 'hair', 'worst', 'lines', 'worst', 'everything', 'years', 'good', 'guys', 'led', 'Michael', 'Ironside', 'only', 'good', 'point', 'here', 'battle', 'control', 'Cuba', 'brain', 'coupled', 'own', 'fight', 'memories', 'Bad', 'effects', 'loopy', 'writing', 'make', 'weak', 'execution', 'have', 'give', 'props', 'doing', 'exploding', 'head', 'routine', 'minute', 'one', 'kidding', 'aside', 'was', 'really', 'nothing', 'hold', 'interest', 'sound', 'over-saturated', 'brain', 'sequence', 'almost', 'mix', 'Johnny', 'Neumonic', 'Matrix', 'painfully', 'done', 'inside-his-head', 'effects', 'are', '80s-ish', 'have', 'TV', 'look', 'picture', 'decent', 'clarity', '5.1', 'utilized', 'often', 'outer', 'channels.The', 'supplement', '17-minute', 'making', 'interviews', 'adequate', 'scenes', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'Interesting', 'points', 'included', 'usage', 'now', 'defunct', 'Watchmen', 'street', 'set', 'Cuba', 'being', 'moved', 'script', 'enjoyment', 'everyone', 'getting', 'work', 'Ironside', 'documentary', 'feel', 'fluff', 'piece', 'better', 'way', 'making', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'trying', 'entertain', 'One', 'star', 'film', 'one', 'supplement', 'Skipper', 'otherwise.EDIT', 'Speaking', 'bad', 'hair', 'just', 'realized', 'cover', 'art', 'not', 'pic', 'Val', 'film', 'trust', 'what', 'do', 'looked', 'film', 'promote', 'sales', 'best', 'could', 'tell', 'came', 'Conspiracy', 'one', 'other', '20', 'films', 'last', 'year', 'oh', 'well']",N/A
