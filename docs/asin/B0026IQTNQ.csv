It's a cross between Saw and Hostel. The first 15 minutes start out great. I was very interested. Then the viewer learns that a ""remake"" of some snuff films is being made (then switch to the real movie). I always hate those movies in which movies are being made inside the movie--especially in horror films. Well, the ""skeleton crew"" finds the real snuff films made by a madman in the run-down mental hospital. The director becomes obsessed with them and begins killing the crew while filming it. After the first 15 minutes of the movie, it goes downhill fast. The characters are not likeable, and I really did not care if they got killed or not. It just becomes so ridiculous. Characters are walking around aimlessly in the building looking around corners. I really do not think this movie would even make it to the Sci Fi network 10 years from now. I watched about 3/4 of the movie then got up out my bed to write this review. The movie is so bad that I want my money back.",1,"Please, please, please do not waste your money!",1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,1120,"['enjoy', 'small', 'budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'addition', 'blockbusters', 'came', 'movie', 'Best', 'Buy', 'thought', 'would', 'give', 'chance', 'cross', 'Saw', 'Hostel', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'start', 'out', 'great', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'Then', 'viewer', 'remake', 'snuff', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'then', 'switch', 'real', 'movie', 'always', 'hate', 'movies', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'made', 'movie', 'especially', 'horror', 'films', 'Well', 'skeleton', 'crew', 'real', 'snuff', 'films', 'made', 'madman', 'run-down', 'mental', 'hospital', 'director', 'obsessed', 'killing', 'crew', 'filming', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'downhill', 'fast', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'likeable', 'really', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'got', 'killed', 'not', 'just', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'Characters', 'are', 'walking', 'around', 'aimlessly', 'building', 'looking', 'corners', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'even', 'make', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'network', '10', 'years', 'now', 'watched', '3/4', 'movie', 'then', 'got', 'up', 'bed', 'write', 'review', 'movie', 'so', 'bad', 'want', 'money', 'back']",Skeleton Crew

Dennis Moore""","[0, 0]","Finland, Finland, Finland, the country where I want to be...Then again, if this movie is any indication of Finland's horror scene, maybe I'm good in the States.  I know, I know, judging an entire country on the basis of one movie would be like those same countries judging the US on the basis of a Todd Sheets movie.  So I'll reserve judgment of Finland as a country until I see more.As for this movie, it was crap.Writer/Director Steven is filming his masterpiece, SILENT CREEK in an abandoned mental hospital in Finland where, in the 1970s, the police discovered the resident doctor was making snuff films featuring his patients.  The place has been empty since then and Steven thought it would be perfect to film his movie, a fictionalized account of the very events that took place there, on location.  Halfway through filming, the crew happens to find the original films made by the doctor, who had taken to calling himself The Auteur, in a sealed room.  Steven becomes obsessed with the movies and in a scene I couldn't quite figure out either loses his mind or becomes possessed by the Auteur.  From here you can figure out the last half of the movie: Steven, as Auteur, decides to make his movie as real as possible by killing off his cast and crew one by one, and filming it.Wow.  What a twist.  I didn't see that coming.  It was much better than CATS.  I'm going to see it again and again.  The victims then make the brilliant deduction that they're inside a horror film, so they need to start playing by the rules.  First order of business, ""Let's go to the basement.""  Hmm.  Let's rethink this.  Locked in a mental institution, a group of half a dozen strong, able-bodied people against one crazy man with an 8mm camera.  Let's go to the basement.How bout let's all stay in this well-lit room, together.  Or better yet, let's four of us keep watch while the other two work to get the chains off the door so we can get out.  I'm telling you now, the moment I find myself in a horror movie situation, following the rules is the last thing I'm doing.  No splitting up, no going to the friggin basement, and if Jim Bob--or in this case, Jyrki or Eero or whatever the hell they're named in Finland--wanders off, fk him, shoulda been here.Unfortunately, story is actually the least of SKELETON CREW's problems.  Lots of movies play with the rules, lots of movies break them, hell lots of movies don't even make any sense, but sometimes they have great actors who make up for it (logically, the focus character of STAY should have been Ryan Gosling's character, not Ewan MacGregor's, but that's another review for another time), but SKELETON CREW has a van-load of Fins with no previous or post-SC acting credits.  And maybe not all of the blame goes to the actors, after all it can't be the easiest thing in the world to emote convincingly while also trying to work your Finnish mouth around the English language, what with our noticeable lack of umlauts and such.  Here's a thought: if you're making a movie in Finland, set in Finland, about a story that took place in Finland and you're using primarily Finnish actors, just speak Finnish; I don't mind reading subtitles.  Honest.As it is, the Finnish actors stumbling over the English language just comes across as clumsy and difficult to watch and takes away any hope of tension or suspense the story might otherwise have conveyed.That doesn't even cover the serious over-acting, which was worst in Steven Porter as Steve the director, and in David Yoken who plays Bruce, a veteran actor who can't stop talking about the actors and directors he's worked with, even though he's now playing the Auteur in Steven's crappy movie in Finland.  Both were so annoyingly bad I began to cringe when they appeared onscreen because I knew that, whatever was coming, it wasn't going to be pleasant.The special effects are pretty good.  In fact, production design in general is pretty good.  The look of the film is great, from the rundown hospital with the peeling paint to the few outside shots that made me shiver with the cold of them, to the quality of the ""found"" snuff films.  The kills are well-done, some of them even inspired, but they weren't enough to excuse the acting or the story, unfortunately.And speaking of the story, I have to wonder just what writers Tero and Teemu Molin and director Tommi Lepola were thinking when they made the first twenty minutes of the movie a complete cheat.  We don't even get to the movie SKELETON CREW until after an extended sequence of the opening to SILENT CREEK, which is played, at first, like the real movie, until a camera shows up in the mirror and Steven the director yells cut.  Then it's revealed everything up to that point, nearly a quarter of the entire movie so far, hadn't even been real.  Now, this could work, logically, if it had all been filmed in one long take.  But with multiple locations, multiple cuts and angles and sets--even a dream sequence thrown in for added ""suspense and terror""--unless Steven is cutting and assembling his movie as he makes it and is filming it in sequence, that doesn't work because we move so seamlessly from the world of the interior movie to the world of making that interior movie that it kills the illusion and says to the viewer, ""You just wasted even more of your day.""  It also signals to the viewer right away that there are problems with this movie that go beyond a predictable story or bad acting.Then again, maybe this is simply a Finnish horror movie thing that crops up in the majority of their horror, like ghost girls with long black hair in Japanese horror.  All I can say with certainty is that while this movie looks pretty good, everything else about it is crap.  It's simply not worth the rental, and certainly not worth a purchase; I can't imagine anyone would need to own this movie so that when one of its stars becomes famous they can say they were watching their career even before they were famous; trust me, no one in this movie is going on to bigger fame.  Do yourself a favor and save the Euros for something else.  Maybe something Australian; they seem to be doing pretty good the past several years.",2,Skeleton Crew,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",2012,6176,"['Finland', 'Finland', 'Finland', 'country', 'where', 'want',

E Jackson,"[0, 0]","Clearly the best part of Skeleton Crew is the first 20 minutes where *actual* horror and suspense takes place.Immediately after that, the film is completely ruined by that very cheap and popular storyline direction that many films in the genre happen to be a victim of- a sudden realization that everything is just a big prank.Or in the case of Skeleton Crew, all those suspenseful events in the beginning that involve a girl in a dangerous mental institution that you *believed* was something incredibly suspenseful and something you *believed* would make this movie a top notch thriller the entire way through, is actually anything but- what you're witnessing and enjoying is actually just part of a script that a crew is filming (a movie inside a movie, if you will) so right after a certain segment involving a violent and bloody death with an axe, you (the viewer) will be given a very annoying and surprising slap in the face when all that suspense that was building completely goes out the window in a moment of ""Why would the writers DO this to me!"" storytelling, and it never returns.It basically means as soon as you find out that everything you've been enjoying is just a big lame horrendously inexcusable joke, you have to start over again with a new, less interesting storyline and try to pretend the first 20 minutes of suspense never happened.  Unacceptable.  It's an extremely disappointing way to write a storyline for a horror movie believe me, because all it does is completely fool the viewers and make them incredibly upset.I've seen other films do the same exact thing to the storyline, and it never becomes bearable or even approaches anywhere near understandable why we'd be tortured in such a way, or how destroying the suspense in one fell swoop could possibly be considered entertaining.

I mean the film within the film.... the actual film isn't bad either.Though the addition of spirits to the plot was unnecessary, and could have easily been removed, the overall idea was interesting enough.With a bigger budget, and better actors this might have actually been a pretty decent flick.The special effects were amateurish, which is essential in the kind of flick where gore is the star.But they weren't bad enough to kill the flick, just tame it.The acting is what ultimately seals this flicks tomb.Most of the time it felt god-awful, though sometimes it felt like it might have been improving.In the end it was bad enough to keep you from getting into the story.The actor playing Bruce for whatever reason, played a doctor better than an actor.

Back in the 1970s, this doctor at this mental institution went insane and started filming himself killing the patients in all sorts of tortuous ways.  Steven (Steve Porter) decides the true story of ""The Auteur"" would make a great movie, so he's brought a handful of Finnish actors and movie production folks to that very location to film what he apparently thinks is going to be a fantastic horror film.  That right there should have been an early warning sign that Steven and sanity weren't the best of friends.  Midway through filming, the crew discovers a secret room in the institution which served as the mad doctor's private screening room for his self-produced snuff films - along with an undiscovered cache of the Auteur's private collection.  Declaring it a pre-production research dream come true, Steven indulges in a snuff film marathon, rewrites the horror film he is making, and - increasingly annoyed at the lack of realism during filming - decides to take matters into his own hands.Sure, the gore isn't all that bad, but that's little consolation for even bad-movie lovers to sit through ninety minutes of such pathetic filmmaking.  There's not even any decent female nudity to help ease the pain of Skeleton Crew.  The fact that the ending in particular has some real problems really just rubs salt in what is already a festering wound.  Boy Scouts should get a merit badge for sitting through this entire film.  It was a struggle for me to even find a character I could pretend to care about the least little bit, and I knew what was going to happen to her and everyone else because the whole story is exceedingly predictable.  I don't make it a habit of saying I could do a better job of filmmaking, but I thought the filmmakers totally blew one golden opportunity of introducing a new twist to the story that would certainly have made for a compelling scene and might have saved the whole film from absolute mediocrity.  Unfortunately, Tommi Lepola and Tero Molin were directing the film instead of me (or anyone else on Earth), so what you get is one stinking cow patty of a film.",1,A pitiful excuse of a horror movie,1272326400,"04 27, 2010",2010,2645,"['Skeleton', 'Crew', 'sort', 'perfect', 'storm', 'painfully', 'bad', 'horror', 'movies', 'freakish', 'combination', 'putrid', 'directing', 'terrible', 'acting', 'horrible', 'writing', 'awful', 'cinematography', 'subplot', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'etc', 'not', 'everything', 'went', 'wrong', 'production', 'movie', 'fact', 'everything', 'was', 'wrong', 'start', 'long', 'skeleton', 'crew', 'hack', 'filmmakers', 'ever', 'set', 'foot', 'Finnish', 'mental', 'institution', 'location', 'lack', 'better', 'word', 'story', 'So', 'here', 'deal', 'Back', '1970s', 'doctor', 'mental', 'institution', 'went', 'insane', 'started', 'filming', 'killing', 'patients', 'sorts', 'tortuous', 'ways', 'Steven', 'Steve', 'Porter', 'true', 'story', 'Auteur', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'movie', 'brought', 'handful', 'Finnish', 'actors', 'movie', 'production', 'folks', 'very', 'location', 'film', 'what', 'apparently', 'going', 'be', 'fantastic', 'horror', 'film', 'right', 'there', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'early', 'warning', 'sign', 'Steven', 'sanity', 'were', ""n't"", 'best', 'friends', 'Midway', 'filming', 'crew', 'secret', 'room', 'institution', 'served', 'mad', 'doctor', 'private', 'screening', 'room', 'self-produced', 'snuff', 'films', 'undiscovered', 'cache', 'Auteur', 'private', 'collection', 'Declaring', 'pre-production', 'research', 'dream', 'come', 'true', 'Steven', 'snuff', 'film', 'marathon', 'horror', 'film', 'making', 'increasingly', 'annoyed', 'lack', 'realism', 'filming', 'decides', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands.Sure', 'gore', ""n't"", 'bad', 'little', 'consolation', 'even', 'bad-movie', 'lovers', 'sit', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'such', 'pathetic', 'filmmaking', 'not', 'even', 'decent', 'female', 'nudity', 'help', 'ease', 'pain', 'Skeleton', 'Crew', 'fact', 'ending', 'particular', 'real', 'problems', 'really', 'just', 'rubs', 'salt', 'what', 'already', 'festering', 'wound', 'Boy', 'Scouts', 'should', 'get', 'merit', 'badge', 'sitting', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'struggle', 'even', 'find', 'character', 'could', 'pretend', 'care', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'happen', 'everyone', 'else', 'whole', 'story', 'exceedingly', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'habit', 'saying', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'filmmaking', 'thought', 'filmmakers', 'totally', 'blew', 'one', 'golden', 'opportunity', 'introducing', 'new', 'twist', 'story', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'made', 'compelling', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'saved', 'whole', 'film', 'absolute', 'mediocrity', 'Unfortunately', 'Tommi', 'Lepola', 'Tero', 'Molin', 'were', 'directing', 'film', 'instead', 'anyone', 'else', 'Earth', 'so', 'what', 'get', 'one', 'stinking', 'cow', 'patty', 'film']",Skeleton Crew
1251481,A3055ZYG2UB80H,B0026IQTNQ,"J. Onorato ""blzbub""","[6, 7]","There are varying degrees of bad.  Some of my favorite movies are what I call 'awesomely bad.'  A few examples of this would be Gingerdead Man, Sick Nurses, Versus, or Chainsaw Sally.  Unfortunately, Skeleton Crew doesn't fall into this category.  This one is more of a 'Wow' bad.To explain:  The main character starts out surviving a car crash and walking to a nearby insane asylum for assistance.  Roll Eyes Here.  Anyway, from the very beginning, the actress playing the main character was not very good at her trade.  Not very good at all.  Beyond that, she had no screen presence, she is somewhat unattractive and she speaks in a brutish sounding Eastern European accent.  I hate to sound so critical, but I seriously wondered who the actress might have been in bed with to get even this meager role.  Perhaps she was the director's girlfriend or something.  As it turned out, that exact scenario was worked into the plot.  She was 'playing' a bad actress who was sleeping with the director.  Aha.Next, we meet the director of the asylum who is, in my estimation, perhaps the second worst actor I've ever seen in a movie.  EVER.  And for reference, the #1 worst actor starred in the  horrible Beyond the Wall of Sleep DVD.But then, we are shown that the actor playing the asylum director is 'playing' a bad actor.  Nevertheless, all the rest of his scenes are bad, just like the main character's.  Go figure.  In fact, other than the young girl playing the character Anna, the movie is filled with bad actors well deserving of gruesome horror-flick deaths.Finally, it is explained how the whole experience is actually a movie within a movie, within another movie.  Sadly, all three movies are beyond redemption.",1,wow bad.,1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,1716,"['are', 'varying', 'degrees', 'bad', 'favorite', 'movies', 'are', 'what', 'call', ""'awesomely"", 'bad', 'few', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'Gingerdead', 'Man', 'Sick', 'Nurses', 'Versus', 'Chainsaw', 'Sally', 'Unfortunately', 'Skeleton', 'Crew', ""n't"", 'fall', 'category', 'one', 'more', ""'Wow"", 'bad.To', 'explain', 'main', 'character', 'out', 'surviving', 'car', 'crash', 'walking', 'nearby', 'insane', 'asylum', 'assistance', 'Roll', 'Eyes', 'Here', 'Anyway', 'very', 'beginning', 'actress', 'playing', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'trade', 'Not', 'very', 'good', 'Beyond', 'had', 'screen', 'presence', 'somewhat', 'unattractive', 'brutish', 'sounding', 'Eastern', 'European', 'accent', 'hate', 'sound', 'so', 'critical', 'seriously', 'wondered', 'who', 'actress', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'bed', 'get', 'even', 'meager', 'role', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'director', 'girlfriend', 'something', 'turned', 'out', 'exact', 'scenario', 'was', 'worked', 'plot', 'was', ""'playing"", 'bad', 'actress', 'who', 'was', 'sleeping', 'director', 'Aha.Next', 'meet', 'director', 'asylum', 'who', 'estimation', 'perhaps', 'second', 'worst', 'actor', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'EVER', 'reference', '1', 'worst', 'actor', 'starred', 'horrible', 'Beyond', 'Wall', 'Sleep', 'DVD.But', 'then', 'are', 'shown', 'actor', 'playing', 'asylum', 'director', ""'playing"", 'bad', 'actor', 'Nevertheless', 'rest', 'scenes', 'are', 'bad', 'just', 'main', 'character', 'Go', 'figure', 'fact', 'other', 'young', 'girl', 'playing', 'character', 'Anna', 'movie', 'filled', 'bad', 'actors', 'well', 'deserving', 'gruesome', 'horror-flick', 'deaths.Finally', 'explained', 'how', 'whole', 'experience', 'actually', 'movie', 'movie', 'movie', 'Sadly', 'three', 'movies', 'are', 'redemption']",Skeleton Crew
