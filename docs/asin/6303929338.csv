389594,AAZRWLML88IZK,6303929338,A kids review,"[0, 0]","Who doesn't love Winnie the Pooh. Heck, he's like on of he most innocent things on the planet. I think there's a law actually forbidding people not ot like him. I know poeple who despise Mickey Mouse, but they can't bring themselves to say they hate Winnie the Pooh. So what is it? What is it that just makes him so likeable? Well, I think alot of it has to do with, while he's very optomistic, he makes alot of mistakes and he does get in trouble. He's naive, but he's also very pleasent, and I think that makes him much more interesting then someone like Mickey Mouse. He's still positive, but there's much more of a character to play with. And it all started with this one film, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.These characters are so famous now I don't even have to name them: Kanga, Roo, Tiger, Owl, Rabbit, Piglet, Eeyore, the list goes on. The story is very loose, in that there's not much of a flowing narrative. It's just the life of Pooh and his friends over the course of a year, maybe. It's juast all the troubles, circumstances, and weird situations they get into, and how they manage to live or get around it.As a kid I liked it fine. But now watching it as a adult, actually it's alot better than I remember it. They actually make alot of fourth wall jokes about the book they're in and even talk about the narrator.But that's not the only reason it's good. There's just this sense to it, this atmosphere, this real likeability to this world they created. It's very laid-back. It's very slow-paced, but at the same time these characters are just so interesting and so nice that you enjoy spending time with them. You don't care that not alot is going on. You could just have a conversation with any one of these people and be ver satisfied. I really like movies like that, that don't think they have to stick to the three-act structure. They just let characters berthe and do whatever they do.And these characters are really enjoyable and the situations they get into are really enjoyable. We get some really creative scenarios with the windstorm, Pooh trying to get more honey, and, of course, a trippy-as-hell Disney scence with Heffalumps and Woozles.The songs are very clever, the animation actually matches the mood and stlye they're goining for, and, like I said, just a really heavy atmosphere to it.I especially like the ending. There's no big climax, no chase scene, no major discoveries. It's just Christopher Robin talking to his imaginary friend about the inevetability of the future. That's actually kind of heavy stuff.Winnie the Pooh is not often looked at as one of the great Disney films, but it is looked at as one of the great Disney characters, and that's all the film is, just enjoying this cahracter and all the people around him. It's clever. It's nice. It's friendly. I really enjoyed  watching it again. In fact it's one of the few Disney movies where I liked it just as much as a kid as I do as an adult. It takes me back to that same place I enjoy and I always love coming back.",5,The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,1324252800,"12 19, 2011",2011,3027,"['Who', ""n't"", 'love', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Heck', 'most', 'innocent', 'things', 'planet', 'think', 'law', 'actually', 'forbidding', 'people', 'not', 'know', 'poeple', 'who', 'despise', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'say', 'hate', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'So', 'what', 'What', 'just', 'so', 'likeable', 'Well', 'think', 'do', 'very', 'optomistic', 'alot', 'mistakes', 'get', 'trouble', 'naive', 'also', 'very', 'pleasent', 'think', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'then', 'someone', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'still', 'positive', 'much', 'more', 'character', 'play', 'started', 'one', 'film', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh.These', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'famous', 'now', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'name', 'Kanga', 'Roo', 'Tiger', 'Owl', 'Rabbit', 'Piglet', 'Eeyore', 'list', 'story', 'very', 'loose', 'not', 'much', 'flowing', 'narrative', 'just', 'life', 'Pooh', 'friends', 'course', 'year', 'maybe', 'juast', 'troubles', 'circumstances', 'weird', 'situations', 'get', 'how', 'manage', 'live', 'get', 'it.As', 'kid', 'liked', 'fine', 'now', 'watching', 'adult', 'actually', 'alot', 'better', 'remember', 'actually', 'make', 'alot', 'fourth', 'wall', 'jokes', 'book', ""'re"", 'even', 'talk', 'narrator.But', 'not', 'only', 'reason', 'good', 'just', 'sense', 'atmosphere', 'real', 'likeability', 'world', 'created', 'very', 'laid-back', 'very', 'slow-paced', 'same', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'so', 'interesting', 'so', 'nice', 'enjoy', 'spending', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'not', 'alot', 'going', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'conversation', 'one', 'people', 'be', 'ver', 'satisfied', 'really', 'movies', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'stick', 'three-act', 'structure', 'just', 'let', 'characters', 'berthe', 'do', 'do.And', 'characters', 'are', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'situations', 'get', 'are', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'get', 'really', 'creative', 'scenarios', 'windstorm', 'Pooh', 'trying', 'get', 'more', 'honey', 'course', 'trippy-as-hell', 'Disney', 'scence', 'Heffalumps', 'Woozles.The', 'songs', 'are', 'very', 'clever', 'animation', 'actually', 'mood', 'stlye', ""'re"", 'goining', 'said', 'just', 'really', 'heavy', 'atmosphere', 'it.I', 'especially', 'ending', 'big', 'climax', 'chase', 'scene', 'major', 'discoveries', 'just', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'talking', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'inevetability', 'future', 'actually', 'kind', 'heavy', 'stuff.Winnie', 'Pooh', 'not', 'often', 'looked', 'one', 'great', 'Disney', 'films', 'looked', 'one', 'great', 'Disney', 'characters', 'film', 'just', 'enjoying', 'cahracter', 'people', 'clever', 'nice', 'friendly', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'again', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'Disney', 'movies', 'where', 'liked', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'kid', 'do', 'adult', 'back', 'same', 'place', 'enjoy', 'always', 'love', 'coming', 'back']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

389598,A1UXMT6XQFZLA1,6303929338,"Anthony G Pizza ""trivialtony""","[21, 23]","Like that other cuddly British import, James Bond, Winnie The Pooh grew (diminished?) from literary figure to film icon to corporate symbol. Each new feature starring either has dumbed down character and plot to  cariacture; in Bond's case, gadgetry and double entendre, in Pooh's,  platitudes about family and friendship (Not that A.A. Milne, Pooh's  creator, opposed these bedrock concepts, he chose more creative, knotty  ways to express them in his narratives.)It helps to remember the basics.  In Pooh's case, that means Milne's books and this film, which gently  introduces Pooh and his friends Owl, Rabbit, Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger and  Christopher Robin. It does so while adhering to the books' narrative tone  (helped by narrarator Sebastian Cabot). The songs, voices (particularly  Paul Winchell and the late Sterling Holloway as Pooh), backgrounds, and  characterizations would never be closer to Milne's (or for that matter,  Walt Disney's) original vision. The Pooh TV series tried weekly to capture  the wistfulness of the book's and film's final moments where Christopher  Robin goes to school and leaves the Hundred Acre Wood. Here, it's done with  minimal sentimentality while capturing loss of preschool imagination and  happy isolation children face. This video is essential for anyone owning  anything with Pooh's picture on it.

The characters in this movie are many, and each has a charming, and unique personality that adds to the synergy of the cast.  While the storyline isn't all that riveting, the interplay between the characters makes you feel as though you could have dreamed about them as a child, playing in the backyard (100 acre wood) with your stuffed animal toys.  Admittedly, the heffalumps and whoozles skit appears to be ""drug induced"" on the part of the animators, but it's just a little dark humor mixed in to balance the sometimes sterile innocence of the film.

389619,A15IN5H4IATSHQ,6303929338,Classic film buff,"[2, 2]","When the first Winnie the Pooh short animated feature was released, I was on the cusp of adolescence, totally uninterested, I vaguely remember seeing some commercials after Disney's ""Wonderful World of Color"" TV show.  Many years later, my wife introduced me to the Winnie the Pooh phenomenon.  She's nine years younger than I, and was raised on the original A.A. Milne stories and the Disney films; when our son was born she was determined he love Pooh and friends as much as she, he did, and so did I!""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" is actually a compilation of 3 short films into a full-length feature, which was Walt Disney's plan.  He felt that although the Winnie the Pooh characters were well known and loved in Britain and Europe this was not quite the case in America.  Introducing them gradually as a series of short films beginning in 1966 would gain acceptance & recognition by American audiences, and then they would be linked together as a complete film.  His plan worked splendidly although sadly he didn't live to see it, the film opened in 1977, and Pooh and company have become household names for American kids.Winnie the Pooh, or Pooh as he is more commonly known, is a cuddly golden yellow teddy bear that loves honey.  He lives in the Hundred Acre Wood, along with his close friends, the ebullient, bouncing Tigger, the small, timid Piglet, the gloomy donkey Eeyore, Kanga and her little boy Roo, the garrulous Owl, querulous Rabbit and the whistlin' Gopher.  This little band are all close friends and all look to Christopher Robin, a little boy who frequently visits them for help and guidance when it's needed.  He is the ideal friend, mentor and advisor to them, and there is mutual love shared among them all.The stories are wonderfully innocent in their simplicity, with a gentle humor that is ideal for toddlers up to ages six or seven.  The characters are good role models for young children, they back each other up, help each other out when needed, and they never criticize one another or argue.  Yet they are never boring, they're entertaining, charming and loveable, full of the wonder of childhood, when a child begins to discover the wide world of imagination, peopled with the most fantastic characters and places.There couldn't be more ideal casting for the actors that supply the voices, beginning with Sterling Holloway as Pooh.  His warm, honeyed drawl is charming and soothing to the ear.  Master ventriloquist Paul Winchell with his exuberant lisp brings the bouncy Tigger to carefree life.  John Fiedler supplies the uncertain treble of Piglet, while Ralph Wright is the deep bass voice for the pessimistic Eeyore.  Barbara Luddy, a Disney veteran, gives sweet, maternal tones to Kanga, and Sebastian Cabot lends his polished English accent as the Narrator.  The other actors are all marvelous as well.  However, it's not just the voices but how they use them; they are all masters in breathing life and emotion into these cartoon characters and making them as real as you and I.The musical score is by the Disney in-house songwriting team, the Sherman Brothers, and it's delightful, easy, simple melodies and lyrics a child can appreciate & remember given enough viewings.  Actually not just children, I found myself while lathering up in the shower one morning singing ""I'm just a little black raincloud hovering under the honey tree...""!My darling wife got her wish fairly early, our son was about six months old in his stroller as we were browsing in our local ""Disney Store"", when he grabbed a plush, cuddly Pooh bear from a display and hugged it to him, so of course we bought it.  Pooh was his nighttime buddy always, even when we went away.  Soon he was watching Pooh's TV show with his mother on the Disney Channel along with this movie, and also two holiday specials that were family favorites, ""Boo to You, Too!"" and ""Winnie the Pooh & Christmas Too!"" (Recommend both highly, unfortunately not sure if they're still available)  On a trip to Disney World back in 1999 when he was just five, he was thrilled when we had ""Breakfast with Pooh"", and he got to hug Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, Piglet, etc, pose for photos  & also get their autographs, in addition to going on the Pooh ride!  By that time, I was totally indoctrinated to the world of Pooh and didn't mind at all the repeated viewings of this and other Pooh videos (in the pre DVD days), I loved them just as much as my wife and son, and added to the experience by reading to our boy the original A.A. Milne stories, which I also highly recommend.  As a matter of fact, our family Christmas card that year of 1999 was the three of us posed with Tigger at the Magic Kingdom!A warning though for parents, the very last vignette in the film is touchingly beautiful, but may leave you misty eyed.  It's Christopher Robin & Pooh alone together just before Christopher is going away to school, bidding each other goodbye for awhile, as Christopher Robin's halcyon childhood starts to ebb away.  The dialogue is so lovingly written,(the title of this review is my favorite line) both Jon Walmsley as Christopher Robin and Sterling Holloway as Pooh put so much emotion and feeling into the words that even the most hardened heart would be moved.  I always have tears in my eyes and a lump in the throat even after many viewings, but I remember one time vividly.  I was sitting with my little boy, who was about a year and a half old, on my lap already wet eyed as Sebastian Cabot intoned the final words as Pooh and Christopher Robin holding hands run happily into the distance.  ""Wherever they go and whatever happens to them on the way, in that enchanted place on top of the forest a little bear will always be waiting.""  My son waved at the screen and said ""Bye-bye, Pooh!"" as I proceeded to lose the little composure I still had, as it was brought home to me as to how exquisite, precious and fleeting is the world of childhood, and I enveloped him in a bear hug and kiss.Before closing, a quick word about the extras, they're terrific, and include a making of featurette, the short ""A Day for Eeyore"" ""The 100 Acre Wood Challenge"" game, Disney Storytime, ""Pooh's Shadow"", a sing-along song"" the Wonderful Thing About Tiggers"" Carly Simon singing the Winnie the Pooh theme song among others.  So share this gem of a movie with your children or grandchildren and treasure the all too short time before they outgrow it.  As for us, we have our son's Pooh bear fluffed and cleaned in a special place of honor all ready for the next generation when it comes!",5,"""And Pooh, promise you won't forget me, ever?

I haven't seen one.What this DVD is, I think, is a compilation of three films woven into one full-length film, movies that were originally done in the mid to late-1960s and then put into this format later. Whatever, it's simply a bunch of nice stories about the famous Pooh and his friends.This is refreshing in that there is very, very little violence and no evil characters, no bad guys, both of which are unusual in animated films. The stories are told through a ""book"" which is pictured as the stories unfold. Illustrations are shown in the book and they they come to life to show the particularly story.The voice of Pooh was done by one of the great voices in Hollywood history: Sterling Holloway. All the characters are quite different and there is nice humor here and there for adults and kids. This is as sweet-natured a film as you could ever find. To some it may sound boring, but it's so different in its approach that it is subtly appealing to all ages. I have appreciated this film more and more on each time.This is timeless material and very highly recommended for your kids and for you.

The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh is one of the better know and most beloved entries into the Disney animated film cannon with unforgettable characters and one of the rare occasions where the new Xerography process suits the material. The Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.While this film doesn't compare to the early classics, it is one of their most memorable for this time period, although this is actually three short segments sewn together and feels more like a TV program, it still deserves it's classic status. The story book backdrop lends perfectly to the animation style and the animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone and some others from this time period between 1961-1981.The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed tend to come across like their unpolished, but this is really not the case with this film, Jungle Book and 101 Dalmatians. Because Disney ended the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and the new Blu Ray and all have their good points and bad points. the first release was released in full screen and the second in 1:75:1 and the new Blu Ray is 1:66:1 which seems to work well as the film doesn't appeared cramped. It would be nice if Disney would include multiple formats on the newer releases as the extras are thin and there is room for them. It would also let buyers have more options for playback. The restoration looks impressive, but because of the style of animation and the Xerography process the rough lines seem a little too rough for my taste in some areas. I prefer the earlier films over the films from 1961-1981. These films seem to be missing some of Walt's magic, although these segments were created while Walt was alive, he died before they became the classics he predicted. The story of Pooh was loved and known a long time before Disney gave us their version and it is a credit to them that they have given us the definitive version that comes to everyone's mind when the character is mentioned.While the Blu Ray looks great, I thought the 25th anniversary DVD looked great too, the addition of some pretty lack luster extras on the Blu Ray isn't enough to push to buy this, but if you want to own The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, then the Blu Ray is the way to go, but I'll keep my DVD for the full screen aspect ratio.",4,"NICE BLU RAY TRANSFER, BUT DISNEY DROPS THE BALL AGAIN WITH NO FULL SCREEN RELEASE!",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2013,2919,"['Disney', 'Studios', '22nd', 'full', 'length', 'animated', 'feature', 'film', 'Disney', 'studios', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'one', 'better', 'know', 'most', 'beloved', 'entries', 'Disney', 'animated', 'film', 'cannon', 'unforgettable', 'characters', 'one', 'rare', 'occasions', 'where', 'new', 'Xerography', 'process', 'suits', 'material', 'Xerography', 'process', 'being', 'cost', 'saving', 'achievement', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'newer', 'films', 'better', 'opinion', 'fact', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Disney', 'luster', ""'ve"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'film', ""n't"", 'compare', 'early', 'classics', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'time', 'period', 'actually', 'three', 'short', 'segments', 'sewn', 'together', 'feels', 'more', 'TV', 'program', 'still', 'classic', 'status', 'story', 'book', 'backdrop', 'perfectly', 'animation', 'style', 'animation', 'process', 'been', 'fleshed', 'more', 'new', 'process', ""n't"", 'as', 'jarring', 'seemed', 'Sword', 'Stone', 'others', 'time', 'period', '1961-1981.The', 'artwork', 'beautiful', 'film', 'totally', 'different', 'style', 'rougher', 'lines', 'drawings', 'being', 'exposed', 'tend', 'come', 'unpolished', 'really', 'not', 'case', 'film', 'Jungle', 'Book', '101', 'Dalmatians', 'Disney', 'ended', 'traditional', 'process', 'fabulous', 'looking', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'yes', 'one', 'scene', 'used', 'sort', 'trial', 'films', 'very', '2', 'dimensional', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'magical', 'look', 'them.OK', 'now', 'film', 'video', 'releases', 'have', 'owned', 'DVD', 'releases', 'new', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'have', 'good', 'points', 'bad', 'points', 'first', 'release', 'was', 'released', 'full', 'screen', 'second', '1:75:1', 'new', 'Blu', 'Ray', '1:66:1', 'work', 'well', 'film', ""n't"", 'appeared', 'cramped', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'Disney', 'would', 'include', 'multiple', 'formats', 'newer', 'extras', 'are', 'thin', 'room', 'would', 'also', 'let', 'buyers', 'have', 'more', 'options', 'playback', 'restoration', 'impressive', 'style', 'animation', 'Xerography', 'process', 'rough', 'lines', 'seem', 'little', 'too', 'rough', 'taste', 'areas', 'prefer', 'earlier', 'films', 'films', '1961-1981', 'films', 'seem', 'be', 'missing', 'Walt', 'magic', 'segments', 'were', 'created', 'Walt', 'was', 'alive', 'died', 'became', 'classics', 'predicted', 'story', 'Pooh', 'was', 'loved', 'known', 'long', 'time', 'Disney', 'gave', 'version', 'credit', 'have', 'given', 'definitive', 'version', 'everyone', 'mind', 'when', 'character', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'great', 'thought', '25th', 'anniversary', 'DVD', 'looked', 'great', 'too', 'addition', 'pretty', 'lack', 'luster', 'extras', 'Blu', 'Ray', ""n't"", 'enough', 'push', 'buy', 'want', 'own', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'then', 'Blu', 'Ray', 'way', 'go', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'DVD', 'full', 'screen', 'aspect', 'ratio']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

So I never saw or really researched the original Disney classic until now with the new 25th Aniversary release on DVD.  I was very surprised to see that the majority of the movie's vignettes were produced by Walt himself before his death. I have never read any other the original stories by A.A. Milne, but judging by what I have heard this film does justice to the original classic tales.The film offers simplistic animation, becuase of budget or artistic integrity - - I do not know.  I assume it's the latter becuase the art works perfectly. The art looks just like drawings would look in an old English children's book.This is indeed probably one of the few Disney classics that children 2 years and under could watch all the way through without having to skip over an evil witch, or a pirate, which are too intense for toddlers. For parents, this film is far from the worst thing you could sit through. It's actually not bad at all. It's full of charm.The DVD also has a great making of documentary, with interviews and highlights with the film's artists that better expressed what Walt's vision for Pooh was before he turned into a multi-million dollar machine.",4,The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh 25th Anniversary DVD,1025308800,"06 29, 2002",2002,1221,"['was', 'never', 'really', 'interested', 'Pooh', 'even', 'kid', 'never', 'saw', 'really', 'researched', 'original', 'Disney', 'classic', 'now', 'new', '25th', 'Aniversary', 'release', 'DVD', 'was', 'very', 'surprised', 'see', 'majority', 'movie', 'vignettes', 'were', 'produced', 'Walt', 'death', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'other', 'original', 'stories', 'A.A.', 'Milne', 'judging', 'what', 'have', 'heard', 'film', 'justice', 'original', 'classic', 'tales.The', 'film', 'offers', 'simplistic', 'animation', 'becuase', 'budget', 'artistic', 'integrity', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'assume', 'latter', 'becuase', 'art', 'perfectly', 'art', 'just', 'like', 'drawings', 'would', 'look', 'old', 'English', 'children', 'book.This', 'indeed', 'probably', 'one', 'few', 'Disney', 'classics', 'children', '2', 'years', 'could', 'watch', 'way', 'having', 'skip', 'evil', 'witch', 'pirate', 'are', 'too', 'intense', 'toddlers', 'parents', 'film', 'far', 'worst', 'thing', 'could', 'sit', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'full', 'charm.The', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'making', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'highlights', 'film', 'artists', 'better', 'expressed', 'what', 'Walt', 'vision', 'Pooh', 'was', 'turned', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'machine']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

This dvd captures the oldest and most endearing adventurous stories of that silly ol' bear and his sweet friends.  It also has great extras! There is a game, which I think is most definitely more aimed for young children, but I couldn't resist!  What fun!This is an ultimate disney purchase.  It ranks up there with the special edition of Snow White on dvd, which is the best Disney DVD to own in my opinion. See my review of Snow White for more!I don't really remember watching Pooh cartoons when I was growing up, but I do remember watching them over and over when I was babysitting.

Classic disney cartoons that make us laugh and smile should enchant anyone!Watching these videos as an adult just makes me remember how simple life was as a child, and it reminds me of the importance of friendship.These old Pooh cartoons look outstanding on dvd, and also had such better animators than the newer Pooh videos. You can see the comparision of the two on the extras of the dvd.Pooh has become a huge franchise, but I opt for this one dvd, and my stuffed Pooh bear and the old books.

One of her favorite toys when she was little was a Winnie the Pooh that talked and that was one of first things she remembered when we watched this awesome classic Disney movie. She of course wanted to watch this one with us, and we were thrilled to be spending quality family time together which is one of the great things about Disney movies.No matter your age when watching that silly old bear you can't help but smile at the trials and tribulations they all go through. It is now available on Blu-Ray + DVD and includes some amazing bonus features.  Some of the features includes a fun Disney intermission with fun family games and activities.  My younger nieces and nephews especially loved that part because it was if the characters were inviting you personally to do things with them.  What's not to love about that?The film still looks like it was the older version of Winnie The Pooh many of us grew up watching, but it has been digitized which makes it even better.  The shorts are amazing stories individually but blend together very nicely to tell the whole story of events that take place in the Hundred Acre Woods.

As it is, we're given three strung together as one (Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!) with some new footage (in much the same way asDaffy Duck's Quackbusters). Because of this, there is no consistent story from beginning to end other than the usual hapless, hijinks of the animals from Hundred Acre Wood. I really would have preferred the complete original cartoons, but that's why I don't work for Disney.They certainly don't make cartoons like this anymore though (too busy with soulless rubbish likeMeet the Robinsons [Blu-ray]). TMAOWTP was certainly one of their last greats of old-school animation. The seasonal colors of Hundred Acre Wood and the backgrounds are rather enchanting and atmospheric. I actually had a huge poster from Winnie Pooh and the Blustery Day on my bedroom wall when I was a kid and I could literally look at it for hours as there was so much detail to it.I'm not too keen on Christopher Robin though, he's just a bit too effeminate for me. I hear that Disney are planning on replacing him with a tomboyish girl for future Winnie the Pooh projects. Well, I'm fine with that. The Disney-fied Pooh deviates so far from AA Milne's creation that one more alteration is hardly significant.The only other short is A Day For Eeyore. It's Eeyore's birthday, but none of his so-called friends have bothered to notice. Pooh has made a new game involving chucking sticks into the river to see which one wins in a race. He calls it 'Pooh Sticks'. Now, where I come from that particular noun means something completely different.When Eeyore comes floating along they realize that he is more depressed than usual. When he reveals why the day is supposed to be so special they all run off to find makeshift presents and prepare a party. It actually works, and he cheers up.A fine Winnie the Pooh short, with the great animation and wonderful backgrounds we've come to expect. It also keeps Christopher Robin to a minimum.And why don't they ever call him Winnie?",4,The TWO adventures of Winnie the Pooh,1224201600,"10 17, 2008",2008,2142,"['Disney', 'really', 'could', 'have', 'crammed', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'theatrical', 'shorts', 'disc', ""'re"", 'given', 'three', 'strung', 'together', 'one', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Honey', 'Tree', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Blustery', 'Day', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Too', 'new', 'footage', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'Duck', 'Quackbusters', 'consistent', 'story', 'beginning', 'end', 'other', 'usual', 'hapless', 'hijinks', 'animals', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'really', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'complete', 'original', 'cartoons', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'Disney.They', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'cartoons', 'anymore', 'too', 'busy', 'soulless', 'rubbish', 'likeMeet', 'Robinsons', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'TMAOWTP', 'was', 'certainly', 'one', 'last', 'greats', 'old-school', 'animation', 'seasonal', 'colors', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'rather', 'enchanting', 'atmospheric', 'actually', 'had', 'huge', 'poster', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Blustery', 'Day', 'bedroom', 'wall', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'could', 'literally', 'look', 'hours', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'detail', 'it.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'too', 'keen', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'just', 'bit', 'too', 'effeminate', 'hear', 'Disney', 'are', 'planning', 'replacing', 'tomboyish', 'girl', 'future', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'projects', 'Well', ""'m"", 'fine', 'Disney-fied', 'Pooh', 'deviates', 'so', 'far', 'AA', 'Milne', 'creation', 'one', 'more', 'alteration', 'hardly', 'significant.The', 'only', 'other', 'short', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'Eeyore', 'birthday', 'none', 'so-called', 'friends', 'have', 'bothered', 'notice', 'Pooh', 'made', 'new', 'game', 'involving', 'chucking', 'sticks', 'river', 'see', 'one', 'race', 'Sticks', 'Now', 'where', 'come', 'particular', 'noun', 'something', 'completely', 'different.When', 'Eeyore', 'floating', 'realize', 'more', 'depressed', 'usual', 'When', 'why', 'day', 'supposed', 'be', 'so', 'special', 'run', 'off', 'find', 'makeshift', 'presents', 'prepare', 'party', 'actually', 'up.A', 'fine', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'short', 'great', 'animation', 'wonderful', 'backgrounds', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'also', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'minimum.And', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'call', 'Winnie']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

389646,A3C94LV082BV2T,6303929338,"J. Davis ""Just a guy.""","[8, 10]","Winnie-the-Pooh is an old childhood favorite of mine. From seeing cartoons on TV to keeping only two of my old childhood toys (a Pooh bear that had lost it's shirt and a tiger that reminded one of Tigger) to ""The House At Pooh Corner"" being the first full-length book I read, the bear with very little brain was a large influence on my early life.Disney's adaptation of Pooh was my introduction, and I have Walt Disney to thank for that. I wanted to own all of the adaptations (just as I quickly collected all four of Milne's books) on video. There were ""Winnie-the-Pooh and the Honey Tree,"" ""Winnie-the-Pooh and the Blustery Day,"" and ""Winnie-the-Pooh and Tigger, Too."" There was also another cartoon called ""Winnie-the-Pooh and a Day for Eeyore.""My first Pooh video was ""Winnie-the-Pooh and the Blustery Day,"" which is, to this day, stuck in a defective VCR which we later disposed of. Later, shortly after my 17th birthday, I bought the VHS of the 25th anniversary edition of ""The Many Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh,"" the feature film compilation of the features. After about 3 viewings, the tape refused to play.Shortly afterward, I switched to DVD, but goodness! There were so many titles that I wanted to get that Pooh fell far behind.Today, however, I now own this new DVD edition. It has everything I loved about the old VHS tapes, and more. Included from the ""Many Adventures"" tape is ""The Story Behind the Masterpiece"" featurette, originally made for the film's first VHS release, ""Winnie-the-Pooh and a Day for Eeyore,"" and Carly Simon's music video for ""Winnie-the-Pooh."" There are more features, including all the still relevant features from the 25th Anniversary DVD, and a couple new ones, including the first episode of ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh.""Today, it makes me sad that Disney has relegated Pooh to preschool entertainment and cheesy family films. Probably the best thing they did since the cartoons' releases was the animated TV series ""The New Adventures of Winnie-the-Pooh,"" which they should release a complete collection to DVD...I feel that the DVD could have used 2 discs. There could be three ways to watch the film, all possible with branching techniques. How about being able to watch the original shorts seperately, or together in the film, and being able to see the film's TV version with ""A Day For Eeyore"" included? (See, I have ideas!) The first disc could have the film, the viewing options (with extra bits of footage), and ""A Day For Eeyore,"" and the pop-up trivia track (which should be replaced with an audio commentary... too bad Christopher Robin Milne has passed away). The second disc would have all the features.When Disney releases the title again in 2012, maybe they should take my advice. (Of course, by that time, they'll probably be phasing out regular DVDs for Blu-Ray or something else...)Anyways, even though the DVD doesn't quite meet my fondest wishes, it is still delightful and I am glad to have it in my DVD collection at last.",5,Return to the 100-Acre Wood,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",2007,2986,"['Winnie-the-Pooh', 'old', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'mine', 'seeing', 'cartoons', 'TV', 'keeping', 'only', 'two', 'old', 'childhood', 'toys', 'Pooh', 'bear', 'had', 'lost', 'shirt', 'tiger', 'reminded', 'one', 'Tigger', 'House', 'Pooh', 'Corner', 'being', 'first', 'full-length', 'book', 'read', 'bear', 'very', 'little', 'brain', 'was', 'large', 'influence', 'early', 'life.Disney', 'adaptation', 'Pooh', 'was', 'introduction', 'have', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'thank', 'wanted', 'own', 'adaptations', 'just', 'quickly', 'collected', 'four', 'Milne', 'books', 'video', 'were', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Honey', 'Tree', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Blustery', 'Day', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Tigger', 'Too', 'was', 'also', 'cartoon', 'called', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'first', 'Pooh', 'video', 'was', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Blustery', 'Day', 'day', 'stuck', 'defective', 'VCR', 'later', 'disposed', 'Later', 'shortly', '17th', 'birthday', 'bought', 'VHS', '25th', 'anniversary', 'edition', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'feature', 'film', 'compilation', 'features', '3', 'viewings', 'tape', 'refused', 'play.Shortly', 'afterward', 'switched', 'DVD', 'goodness', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'titles', 'wanted', 'get', 'Pooh', 'fell', 'far', 'behind.Today', 'however', 'now', 'own', 'new', 'DVD', 'edition', 'everything', 'loved', 'old', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'more', 'Included', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'tape', 'Story', 'Masterpiece', 'featurette', 'originally', 'made', 'film', 'first', 'VHS', 'release', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'music', 'video', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'are', 'more', 'features', 'including', 'still', 'relevant', 'features', '25th', 'Anniversary', 'DVD', 'couple', 'new', 'ones', 'including', 'first', 'episode', 'Friends', 'Tigger', 'Pooh', 'Today', 'sad', 'Disney', 'relegated', 'Pooh', 'preschool', 'entertainment', 'cheesy', 'family', 'films', 'Probably', 'best', 'thing', 'did', 'cartoons', 'releases', 'was', 'animated', 'TV', 'series', 'New', 'Adventures', 'Winnie-the-Pooh', 'should', 'release', 'complete', 'collection', 'DVD', 'feel', 'DVD', 'could', 'have', 'used', '2', 'discs', 'could', 'be', 'three', 'ways', 'watch', 'film', 'possible', 'branching', 'techniques', 'How', 'being', 'able', 'watch', 'original', 'shorts', 'seperately', 'together', 'film', 'being', 'able', 'see', 'film', 'TV', 'version', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'included', 'See', 'have', 'ideas', 'first', 'disc', 'could', 'have', 'film', 'viewing', 'options', 'extra', 'bits', 'footage', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'pop-up', 'trivia', 'track', 'should', 'be', 'replaced', 'audio', 'commentary', 'too', 'bad', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'Milne', 'passed', 'away', 'second', 'disc', 'would', 'have', 'features.When', 'Disney', 'title', 'again', '2012', 'maybe', 'should', 'take', 'advice', 'course', 'time', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'phasing', 'regular', 'DVDs', 'Blu-Ray', 'something', 'else', 'Anyways', 'even', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'quite', 'meet', 'fondest', 'wishes', 'still', 'delightful', 'am', 'glad', 'have', 'DVD', 'collection', 'last']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

Amazon ranks this movie at about 1,100, a very strong showing that would put this movie in the top 10 of the 41 we ranked.

And for once, that's good! That earlier DVD transfer was already digitally restored and had some good extras, including ""A Day for Eeyore"" and one of Disney's better making-of documentaries, but was pulled off the shelves early last year. Now, however, it's back, with the same vibrant colors, sharp focus and near-perfect 5.1 soundtrack.In other words, this is Disney at its best. ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" is a charming, gentle, quality film that hasn't aged a bit and looks and sounds terrific. Unless you already own the ""25th Anniversary Edition,"" this new release is a must.Actually, there is one new bonus feature: an episode of the computer-animated Disney Channel series, ""My Friends Tigger and Pooh.""

A. Milne, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh delightfully brings to life Christopher Robin, The Hundred Acre Wood, Winnie the Pooh, and all of his friends.  Included are the all the timeless favorites:  Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966), the Oscar-winning Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968), and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too (1974).  Wow, was it really as late as 1974 that we met Tigger for the first time?  I feel like I have know him since I was born!This masterpiece contains some of the most incredible, memorable, and recognizable voice talent of all time, including Sterling Holloway as Pooh, Paul Winchell as Tigger, and John Fiedler as Piglet.  Sebastian Cabot narrates, speaking directly to the characters and to us, and tying all the stories together.  Pooh and his friends clearly loved Sebastian Cabot just as much as we did.The songs are most firmly fixed in my mind - ""Hefalumps and Woozles"", ""The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers"", ""I'm Just a Little Back Rain Cloud"", and of course ""Winnie the Pooh"" to name just a few.  We hum and sing and dance to each one.  The memories are strong here; all the words come pouring back.For the 25th anniversary addition, the animation has been lovingly and vividly restored to its original glory.  This DVD is as stunning as I remember the originals to be. As the pages of the book turn, Pooh seems to leap off the page, and into your heart.My young one loves this as much as I do.

The three movies are ""Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree"" from 1966, ""Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day"" from 1968, and ""Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too!"" from 1974.In the first portion of the movie, we see Winnie the Pooh, silly old Pooh bear, attempt to get honey from high up in a tree.  While Pooh may be a little short on brains, he is long on humor and charm.  In the second portion of the movie wind and rain wreak havoc on the 100 Acre Wood, and Pooh (Sterling Holloway), Kanga and Roo, Owl, Eeyore, Rabbit, and Piglet all must figure out how to survive, retaining all the charm and cleverness of the first portion of the movie.  In the final portion of the movie we get an extended look at Tigger, with all his bouncy charm.  Of course, we must remember that Tigger is the only one!There are many words to characterize Disney movies.  Sometimes they are great.  They are often funny.  Sometimes they are tense.  Usually they are family oriented.  I characterize this movie by one word:  charming.  The characters are all charming and sweet.  The characters capture childhood innocence perfectly.

389669,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,6303929338,Mark Baker,"[52, 58]","Before his death, Walt Disney had started his staff on a series of shorts starring A. A. Milne's creation Winnie the Pooh.  Because he knew American audiences weren't that familiar with the character yet, he decides that a series of short features would be best, followed by a movie combining them together.  This is that movie.  Originally released in 1977, it combines the three shorts that had been previously released, ""Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,"" ""Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day,"" and ""Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too"" with a couple new transitions to make the stories flow together.The story is set in the Hundred Acre Wood where Winnie the Pooh, a bear with very little brain, lives along with his friends.  There's Christopher Robin, a young boy, wise Owl, gloomy Eeyore, Rabbit, small and easily frightened Piglet, Kanga and her son Roo, and bouncy Tigger.  No matter what they face, they face it together, at least in the end.The first set of stories revolves around Pooh's love of honey.  When he runs out, he tries to get some from bees and then visits Rabbit where he gets stuck after eating too much.A natural disaster visits the Hundred Acre woods when a blustery day is followed by a flood.  While facing danger, Pooh also learns about Heffalumps and Woozles who may be after his honey.Finally, Tigger's bouncing gets the best of Rabbit and he tries to debounce Tigger.  Undeterred, Tigger gets himself and Roo stuck in a tree.These cartoons are sweet and innocent.  They easily bring back memories of childhood and simpler times.  There is gentle humor and the simple lessons aren't done in a heavy-handed manner.The style of the animation is fairly unique in the Disney canon.  It's pencil line heavy.  Even though the artists have made it their own, it still reminds the view of Ernest Shepherds charming ""decorations"" from the books.These stories are very true to their source material.  The new character Gopher is introduced, but as he's not in the book, he's not even in the second half.  Probably the most curious choice was the use of a book.  The pages turn as the story progresses and we move in on page illustrations to see what happens next.  I'll admit it took me quite some time to get used to the idea, but I do see the charm in it now.The main audience for this movie has always been kids, and the 25th anniversary release reflects that.  Most of the features are kid friendly, with games, a sing along song, and a story time segment.  Adults will enjoy the behind the scenes featurette.  You can choose to watch the movie with pop up facts running.  Most of them are ordinary, but there are a few fun trivia items included.  Also included is the short ""A Day for Eeyore.""  It was originally released in 1981 and features a few new voices because of cast deaths.  It's a fun feature with a couple of my favorite stories from the books, but is a little disconcerting to watch right after seeing the film.

389671,A2P6PVWZS4NGV0,6303929338,Michael Bulger,"[5, 7]","This is not, by far, the best of Disney.  The three animated shorts that were originally stitched together to make &quot;The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh&quot; date from the late 1960's to the early 1970's, not a vintage Disney era, and it shows.  The animation, while miles above TV-quality fare, isn't particularly good compared to the earlier Disney classics, there are several rather careless holes in the dialogue and plot, and the whole storybook motif is overdone to the point that a rather important plot element (Tigger getting down from the tree) depends entirely upon the narrator.  True purists are also appalled at the changes Disney wrought upon A.A. Milne and Ernest Shepard's original characters.For my part, I think the Disney animators did as good a job here of maintaining the general atmosphere of the original Milne stories as was ever done--the modern efforts don't even come close, and actually reduce the Pooh characters to a status on a par with just about anything else.  I also have a sentimental attachment to the original Disney shorts, since I basically grew up watching them occasionally on TV.  These are gentle stories that will appeal to a wide range of ages, from extremely young (my daughter has been watching them since before she could speak) to late adolescence.  The plot consists of a number of rather underwhelming and pointless events in the lives of a number of stuffed animals inhabiting the &quot;Hundred Acre Wood,&quot; which is rather refreshing from Disney, actually:  no pandering, no didacticism, just (as Homer Simpson might say) &quot;a bunch of stuff that happens.&quot;  The music is occasionally memorable as well; if, after countless viewings demanded by your child(ren), you don't have Pooh's &quot;up-down&quot; song, or &quot;Little Black Raincloud,&quot; or the title song, or for that matter &quot;The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers&quot; running pleasantly through your head, you have no head for music at all.I have never been particularly impressed with the &quot;extras&quot; included with most DVDs, but in this case the folks at Disney have included the fourth theatrical short, &quot;A Day for Eeyore,&quot; which is a very nice bonus, especially since prior to this release one had to buy each short separately on videotape.  The short itself is a bit shocking, though, since the voices, with the exception of Tigger, are radically different.Overall, a nice single-disc package of &quot;classic&quot; Disney Pooh, and something you can show your child(ren) without fear or guilt.",4,Kids just love it,1039219200,"12 7, 2002",2002,2555,"['not', 'far', 'best', 'Disney', 'three', 'animated', 'shorts', 'were', 'originally', 'stitched', 'together', 'make', 'quot', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'quot', 'date', 'late', '1960', 'early', '1970', 'not', 'vintage', 'Disney', 'era', 'animation', 'miles', 'TV-quality', 'fare', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'good', 'compared', 'earlier', 'Disney', 'classics', 'are', 'several', 'rather', 'careless', 'holes', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'whole', 'storybook', 'motif', 'overdone', 'point', 'rather', 'important', 'plot', 'element', 'Tigger', 'getting', 'down', 'tree', 'entirely', 'narrator', 'True', 'purists', 'are', 'also', 'appalled', 'changes', 'Disney', 'wrought', 'A.A.', 'Milne', 'Ernest', 'Shepard', 'original', 'characters.For', 'part', 'think', 'Disney', 'animators', 'did', 'as', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'maintaining', 'general', 'atmosphere', 'original', 'Milne', 'stories', 'was', 'ever', 'done', 'modern', 'efforts', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'come', 'close', 'actually', 'reduce', 'Pooh', 'characters', 'status', 'par', 'just', 'anything', 'else', 'also', 'have', 'sentimental', 'attachment', 'original', 'Disney', 'shorts', 'basically', 'grew', 'up', 'watching', 'occasionally', 'TV', 'are', 'gentle', 'stories', 'will', 'appeal', 'wide', 'range', 'ages', 'extremely', 'young', 'daughter', 'been', 'watching', 'could', 'speak', 'late', 'adolescence', 'plot', 'number', 'rather', 'underwhelming', 'pointless', 'events', 'lives', 'number', 'stuffed', 'animals', 'inhabiting', 'quot', 'Hundred', 'Acre', 'Wood', 'quot', 'rather', 'refreshing', 'Disney', 'actually', 'pandering', 'didacticism', 'just', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'might', 'say', 'quot', 'bunch', 'stuff', 'happens.', 'quot', 'music', 'occasionally', 'memorable', 'as', 'well', 'countless', 'viewings', 'demanded', 'child', 'ren', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'Pooh', 'quot', 'up-down', 'quot', 'song', 'quot', 'Little', 'Black', 'Raincloud', 'quot', 'title', 'song', 'matter', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Thing', 'Tiggers', 'quot', 'running', 'pleasantly', 'head', 'have', 'head', 'music', 'all.I', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'particularly', 'impressed', 'quot', 'quot', 'included', 'most', 'DVDs', 'case', 'folks', 'Disney', 'have', 'included', 'fourth', 'theatrical', 'short', 'quot', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'quot', 'very', 'nice', 'bonus', 'especially', 'prior', 'release', 'one', 'had', 'buy', 'short', 'separately', 'videotape', 'short', 'bit', 'shocking', 'though', 'voices', 'exception', 'Tigger', 'are', 'radically', 'different.Overall', 'nice', 'single-disc', 'package', 'quot', 'classic', 'quot', 'Disney', 'Pooh', 'something', 'can', 'show', 'child', 'ren', 'fear', 'guilt']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

The movie is a combination of three featurettes: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is sometime referred as a package film from some film historians. Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree is basically and introduction of the characters, with the exception of Tigger, and basically tells us how Pooh will go to any lengths to get some honey. Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day we are introduced to Tigger and the main story is that Owl's is damaged during a blustery windy day and that Eeyore finds Owl a new home. In the final featurette, Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too, Tigger gets on Rabbit's nerves and gets trapped in a tall tree. Unlike other package films, this movie does flow from one segment to another.

I'm in my 20's and I grew up with Winnie the pooh not only with the movie but with the tv series and the Book. It is hard to imagine a more delightful DVD introduction to A. A. Milne's cherished Winnie the Pooh books than this 1977 short stories, which gathered the Disney studio's original trio of animated featurettes: Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966): Pooh of course goes out looking for hunny and gets into some trouble, the Oscar-winning Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968): the hundred acre woods is flooded and piglet is in trouble, and Winnie the Pooh and Tigger, Too (1974):this is one of my favorite of the short stories where you meet tigger and you hear him sing his memorable song. Pooh was a pet project of Walt Disney, whose children loved the books about the &quot;willy nilly silly old bear&quot; and his friends in the Hundred Acre Wood. Faithful to the look and gentle spirit of the books, these mellow shorts do Milne proud. With the voices of Sterling Holloway as Pooh, Paul Winchell as Tigger, and John Fiedler as Piglet, the delightful characters come to life. The DVD edition includes a honey jar full of additional special features, including interactive sing-alongs and various activities.

The movie itself is very good, though it drags on a bit. Also, the huffalump nightmare is bizarrely reminiscent of Dr. Seuss cartoons and is out of place in this film. Even the accompanying song sounds like one that would be in a Dr. Seuss cartoon. Otherwise, this one has a good amount of charm to it. Of course, it helps when the source material is superior, as the A.A. Milne books clearly are.

389689,A27NTH2Y9DAR31,6303929338,Schuyler V. Johnson,"[50, 61]","The film is actually composed of material from three previously released animated shorts:Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree (1966)Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day (1968)Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! (1974)Also included:Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore (1983)WTP and the Honey Tree (sp HUNNY)This is the first episode and here we have Pooh visiting an unenthusiastic Rabbit who never enjoys Pooh's company because of his amazing appetite: Pooh's exercise song-""When I up down touch the groundPuts me in the mood-Up down touch the ground-In the mood-for Food!""Pooh, predictably, eats up every last ""smackerel"" of Rabbit's hunny and finds he is now so tubby he is unable to leave Rabbit's house as he cannot squeeze through the hole!The animals run to get Christoper Robin, who, after some consideration, decides Pooh must go on a crash diet. This experiment lasts several agonizing days for both Pooh and Rabbit, who tries in vain to disguise this plump bear and sits in his chair in despair.Eventually Pooh returns to his former ""svelte"" state and emerges from Rabbit's hole with such force he is flung into the next page of the storybook and finds himself in the hole of a hunny tree!WTP and the Blustery DayIt is Wednesday, or WINDSDAY in the Hundred Acre Wood, and little Piglet is industriously sweeping fallen leaves in front of his house-""It's not the leaves that are going, it's the leaves that are coming!"" and Pooh comes by just in time to catch hold of Piglet's scarf to keep him from being carried away in the stiff breeze.Kanga and Roo hop by and Roo begs Pooh: ""Can I fly Piglet next?""The Blustery Day turns into an even more Blustery Night and Pooh hears a Noise. He opens his door to investigate and hears the Noise again-this time he decides (being a bear of Very Little Brain) to invite the Noise in.Here we have a joyous introduction to Tigger, T-I-Double-Ger Tigger!The Wonderful Thing about Tiggers-Is Tiggers are wonderful Things-Their Tops are made out of Rubber-Their Bottoms are madde out of Springs-They're Bouncy Flouncy Bouncy Flouncy Fun Fun Fun Fun Fun!But the most Wonderful thing about Tiggers is I'm the Only One! I'm-the only one!Tigger, after trying Pooh's hunny and finding Tiggers DON'T like it, warns Pooh to beware of Heffalumps and Woozles...Tigger departs leaving Pooh alone to patrol his house guarding against these unknown but scary sounding beasts.Eventually he gets tired and falls asleep dreaming of Heffalumps and Woozles clomping, tromping and trumpeting through his head in a wonderful sequence reminiscent of the Pink Elephant part in Dumbo.The next day the 100 Acre Wood is flooded and Piglet gets swept away on the water clutching a chair. Eventually Piglet is rescued and the friends all meet with Christopher Robin to help Owl find a home to replace the one he lost in the storm. Eeyore ambles over and takes the group to Owl's new home, which turns out to be Piglet's!No one says anything and Piglet generously allows Owl to have his former home and Pooh puts his arm around Piglet and invites him to move into his house.This touching episode ends with a party for the heroes of the day and everyone happy and no one homeless.WTP and Tigger TooTigger's bounce gets on Rabbit's nerves and the friends try to lose him on a trip into the Woods. Rabbit winds up getting lost and scared and Tigger rescues him. Tigger, resuming his bounce, bounces himself into a tree and elicits the help of Sebastian Cabot, the Narrator, to Narrate him down, which Cabot obligingly does, by tipping the book and letting Tigger slide down to the next page of the book.The last episode is WTP and a Day for EeyoreEeyore's Birthday and he thinks no one remembers it. But the gang gets together and eventually give Eeyore his gifts, not in their original condition (Pooh eats all the hunny in the pot which was his gift and Piglet pops the balloon which was his gift) but gratefully accepted nonetheless. Here we are introduced to the new game of Poohsticks.This is really excellent animation and storytelling, with the Disney stalwart Sterling Holloway bringing Pooh to life with his wonderful voice (Cheshire Cat) and Paul Winchell as Tigger.The last feature Disney oversaw personally (with the exception of the last short) and a fine one it is.Pooh is an indispensable addition to any childhood and the animators have a distinct Ernest Shepard flavor to their work, which adds even more to this great classic.""Somewhere in the 100 Acre Woods a little boy and his bear will always be playing.""Paraphrasing from the book, after Christoper Robin goes away to school and has to leave Pooh behind.",5,HEFFALUMPS AND WOOZLES-BEWARE!!,1178323200,"05 5, 2007",2007,4635,"['film',

This is Walt Disney's 22nd full-length animated movie masterpiece. Winnie the Pooh was created in the 1920s out of British author A.A. Milne's whimisical stories he told to his son Christopher Robin.  The character Pooh was created from Christopher's toy bear Edward Bear, and from his favorite London zoo friend &quot;Winnie,&quot; a black bear. The name &quot;Pooh&quot; came from a swan residing also at the zoo. The film is a gathering of these wonderful moments and Disney's magic weaves them into this joyful feature-length movie.This edition includes footage of behind the scenes interviews and how the story of Pooh all started. The original stories are &quot;The Honey Tree,&quot; &quot;The Blustery Day&quot; and &quot;Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too.&quot; &quot;Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day&quot; was nominated and won Best Cartoon Short Subject in 1968.

389701,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,6303929338,theboombody,"[0, 0]","This was never really on my list of movies to watch, but I stumbled on it one day when I had nothing to do, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out.  I kept in mind the sad necessity of cutting parts out of a book for a movie adaptation, and I dreaded seeing what would be left out of this one because I'm such a fan of the original Pooh books.  Disney did great with Pinocchio, but Peter Pan seemed to lose something in the transition, and I hoped Pooh wouldn't suffer the same fate.Sadly, the Pooh Sticks story was left out, and as far as I know it was released on a different Pooh video cassette some years after the original full length movie.  In its place is a story about the first snowfall in the hundred-acre wood that's fairly bland.  That's the only flaw in the movie I could find.  Everything else (besides Tigger's lack of cuteness) was either as good as the original Milne stories or actually better.The most noticeable improvement is in the character of Rabbit.  He's so generic in the books, but Disney really brought him to life.  And him using Pooh's rear end as a hunting trophy was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  He seems to take the place of Eeyore in a lot of the segments, suffering from all kinds of misfortune.  (Eeyore doesn't show up much in the movie, probably because his character is way too depressing.)The score by the Sherman Brothers is once again top notch, and best demonstrated in the nightmare Pooh has about Heffalumps and Woozles - one of my favorite Disney movie scenes.Impressive in its creativity and humor, The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh was probably by far the best Disney film released during the period from the late 60's to the late 80's.",5,"Aside From Mary Poppins, The Best Book To Movie Adaptation By Disney",1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,1722,"['was', 'never', 'really', 'list', 'movies', 'watch', 'stumbled', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'had', 'nothing', 'do', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'well', 'turned', 'out', 'kept', 'mind', 'sad', 'necessity', 'cutting', 'parts', 'book', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'dreaded', 'seeing', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'left', 'one', ""'m"", 'such', 'fan', 'original', 'Pooh', 'books', 'Disney', 'did', 'great', 'Pinocchio', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'seemed', 'lose', 'something', 'transition', 'hoped', 'Pooh', 'would', ""n't"", 'suffer', 'same', 'fate.Sadly', 'Pooh', 'Sticks', 'story', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'as', 'far', 'know', 'was', 'released', 'different', 'Pooh', 'video', 'cassette', 'years', 'original', 'full', 'length', 'movie', 'place', 'story', 'first', 'snowfall', 'hundred-acre', 'wood', 'fairly', 'bland', 'only', 'flaw', 'movie', 'could', 'find', 'Everything', 'else', 'Tigger', 'lack', 'cuteness', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Milne', 'stories', 'actually', 'most', 'noticeable', 'improvement', 'character', 'Rabbit', 'so', 'generic', 'books', 'Disney', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'using', 'Pooh', 'rear', 'end', 'hunting', 'trophy', 'was', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'take', 'place', 'Eeyore', 'lot', 'segments', 'suffering', 'kinds', 'misfortune', 'Eeyore', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'much', 'movie', 'probably', 'character', 'way', 'too', 'depressing', 'score', 'Sherman', 'Brothers', 'once', 'again', 'top', 'notch', 'best', 'demonstrated', 'nightmare', 'Pooh', 'Heffalumps', 'Woozles', 'one', 'favorite', 'Disney', 'movie', 'scenes.Impressive', 'creativity', 'humor', 'Many', 'Adventures', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'was', 'probably', 'far', 'best', 'Disney', 'film', 'released', 'period', 'late', '60', 'late', '80']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS
389702,A7OBFVHNJGI2A,6303929338,Timothy Hulsey,"[7, 7]","This package film from 1977 contains three &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; shorts from the late sixties and early seventies, with a little connecting tissue and an unexpectedly poignant ending thrown in for good measure.  The result is surprisingly cohesive, and, as an adaptation of A.A. Milne's stories, impossible to top.Dorothy Parker reviewed one of the original _Pooh_ books with the tart phrase &quot;Tonstant weader fwowed up,&quot; and anyone who has read Milne knows that he can easily descend into cutesy overkill.  But the Disney film wisely avoids this problem by playing every scene for whimsy and understatement.  It's an unusually delicate mood for a Disney animated feature, and it works much better on television than in a movie theater.The film emphasizes its storybook origins by foregrounding the printed text (especially during the middle &quot;Blustery Day&quot; segments).  Characters and backgrounds bear an astonishingly close resemblance to Ernest Shepard's original watercolor-and-ink illustrations.  Voice talent matches the characters flawlessly, though the voice and design of Christopher Robin are noticeably different in each segment -- a testimony to the film's piecemeal production over nearly a decade.The DVD transfer contains noticeable flicker and grain but relatively few specks and scratches.  Extras are plentiful, including songs and educational games for children, as well as a documentary and art gallery for the grown-ups.  As a less desirable extra, the DVD also includes the lamentable 1983 theatrical short &quot;Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore,&quot; which, unlike the feature film, gets the atmosphere perfectly wrong.Five stars.",5,It's easy to see why this film is so beloved ...,1020816000,"05 8, 2002",2002,1681,"['package', 'film', '1977', 'contains', 'three', 'quot', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'quot', 'shorts', 'late', 'sixties', 'early', 'seventies', 'little', 'connecting', 'tissue', 'unexpectedly', 'poignant', 'ending', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure', 'result', 'surprisingly', 'cohesive', 'adaptation', 'A.A.', 'Milne', 'stories', 'impossible', 'top.Dorothy', 'Parker', 'reviewed', 'one', 'original', '_Pooh_', 'books', 'tart', 'phrase', 'quot', 'Tonstant', 'weader', 'fwowed', 'up', 'quot', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'Milne', 'can', 'easily', 'descend', 'cutesy', 'overkill', 'Disney', 'film', 'wisely', 'problem', 'playing', 'scene', 'whimsy', 'understatement', 'unusually', 'delicate', 'mood', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'much', 'better', 'television', 'movie', 'theater.The', 'film', 'storybook', 'origins', 'foregrounding', 'printed', 'text', 'especially', 'middle', 'quot', 'Blustery', 'Day', 'quot', 'segments', 'Characters', 'backgrounds', 'bear', 'astonishingly', 'close', 'resemblance', 'Ernest', 'Shepard', 'original', 'watercolor-and-ink', 'illustrations', 'Voice', 'talent', 'characters', 'flawlessly', 'voice', 'design', 'Christopher', 'Robin', 'are', 'noticeably', 'different', 'segment', 'testimony', 'film', 'piecemeal', 'production', 'nearly', 'decade.The', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'noticeable', 'flicker', 'grain', 'relatively', 'few', 'specks', 'scratches', 'Extras', 'are', 'plentiful', 'including', 'songs', 'educational', 'games', 'children', 'as', 'well', 'documentary', 'art', 'gallery', 'grown-ups', 'less', 'desirable', 'extra', 'DVD', 'also', 'lamentable', '1983', 'theatrical', 'short', 'quot', 'Winnie', 'Pooh', 'Day', 'Eeyore', 'quot', 'feature', 'film', 'atmosphere', 'perfectly', 'wrong.Five', 'stars']",The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh Walt Disney's Masterpiece  VHS

So while I'm way too old for them now, I wanted to own them for the nostalgic value and was psyched that it was available on Blu-ray AND that digital copy was included.Well, the real ""pooh"" is that you're SOL if you're a Mac and/or iOS user as this is not a true digital download from iTunes, you have to get the video through Amazon Instant Video or Vudu. As I never have used either, I opted for Amazon as I'm a loyal customer and know nothing about Vudu. What a bad choice. Not only is it not a true digital download, but you have to go through the Amazon or Vudu app. Amazon Instant Video only works on iPad, so forget about playing this on your iPhone. To make it even worse, you can only play it in standard definition on your iPad or Mac.I understand that Amazon and Apple are fighting for digital content and tablet supremacy, but DISNEY customers shouldn't be caught in the middle. DISNEY should have provided iTunes as an option to make it a true bundle as the digital copy was an influence in this purchase.While Pooh, Tigger, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit, Kanga, Roo and Owl get 5 stars, Disney and its concept of digital copy (and not being more explicit in the product description) gets 0 stars.
