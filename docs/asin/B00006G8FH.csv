714907,A1TOMYHQD1FVLL,B00006G8FH,"Jerome Cabilan ""ronolo""","[0, 0]","This does look like an average show. The Main character Juna dies in the first episode. From her death she sees a vision of the distant future when man becomes extinct and then sees the cries if the Earth from these creatures called the Raaja. The Raaja are difficult to descibe. They appear in places there the enviroment has been altered where the Earth would have difficulty to heal itself. In other words, these are areas that are heavily polluted. Juna must become the Avatar of time who must fight the Raaja, but not kill them. Why is she not allowed to kill them, I don't think we will get to that on this DVD.The extras on the DVD are short and do satisfy my curiousity. You will meet 2 of the voice actors. The voice actors are Brad Swaile and Maggie O'Hara. They don't have very much to say, but it is interesting to see the faces behind the voices.One comment I got from a friend is that this is going to be the Japanimation version of Captain Planet. I can see where he can see that. You do see areas with high pollution, the death insects suffer as we spray crops, drought in some parts of the world, amongst other natural disasters that we see which are common on the news today. Juna the main character is in a Neon color which is just as bright as Captain Planet. There is some excellent CG(computer graphics).whenever the Raaja come into being. This is a good show visually.

Sylverne,"[0, 0]","When I first originally heard of this anime I just saw a picture of Juna in a costume and the words ""Score by Yoko Kanno"" ""Creators of Escaflowne and Macross Plus""  Knowing that I absolutely loved those two series and I love Yoko Kanno's music, and she scores great series/movies 99% of the time, I asked for the first volume for Christmas.At first I wasn't sure what I thought about this show.  But when I watched it a second time I started to fall in love with it.  I wasn't quite sure what it was that made the series so great, but as I watch more and more episodes I begin to understand.This series takes things on a somewhat more philosophical way.  It covers serious issues, most of them ecological or enivormental, but there are a few small ones that are brought up later, abortion being one of them.The animation is absoluetly gorgeous also, using full potential of computer animation that is being used in the newer animes.  The character styles are somewhat symplistic, but eye appealing in their own way.Bandai offers meager portions of extras, but it's not so bad.  With interviews and a glossary it holds it's own.  The musical score is absolutely beautiful and gorgeous, as one were to expect from Yoko Kanno, and the voice acting is very well done with seasoned Japanese voice actors that the otaku will recognize(Van/Kyo (Escaflowne/Fruits Basket) anyone? >^^&lt;)Overall the series is very well done, and I highly recommend it.  It comes across with messages that make you ponder over them after viewing the episodes.  Not only that, but they're real life issues, that you can relate to in your very own life.

714909,A38MNKGL5TK8XL,B00006G8FH,"lemonzest ""Jenn""","[2, 2]","I was first introduced to Earth Girl Arjuna through my anime club, where I promptly fell in love with the gorgeous animation and compelling storyline. I soon realized that I was one of the only people there who was enjoying it.The story of Arjuna is not one that everyone will take to - many people prefer not to be confronted with the realities of the world we live in, and the manner in which ""Earth Girl Arjuna"" uses to showcase the problems with society and the environment has been criticized as ""preachy"" and ""too Captain Planet-esque"" for many anime fans. I cannot disagree more.The most eloquent review of Arjuna that I have ever read stated this: ""Arjuna condemns no one... it is after all a 'cartoon' that's meant to entertain. However, it seems to ask the viewer to stop and consider one's place in the world and to deeply ponder the things that we do and why we do them."" (Mark, The Black Moon)Within Arjuna, fans of most genres will find something they like. Arjuna is a social commentary disguised as a 'magical girl' show, wherein an ordinary high school student is given fantastic powers. However, these newfound abilities come to Juna, the main character, with several unhappy effects: first, she has to die before she gets them, and once she has the ability to resonate with the Earth, she discovers that a normal life is no longer an option for her. Eating a fast food hamburger becomes a form of torture as Juna is forced to see and experience the process through which the meat was made; everywhere she goes, Juna is the only one who can see the giant worms called Raaja that are intricately connected to pollution and societal breakdown. Juna's family is not the happily clueless bunch so often seen; her newly divorced mother cannot accept Juna's new life and is breaking down because of it, her sister wants nothing to do with her, desiring only a typical teenage existance, and her father only shows up once in the entire series and has no idea how to handle his child.As Juna learns to deal with her powers, her fledgling relationship with her best friend Tokio, and the great responsiblity thrust upon her by a mysterious organization called SEED, the viewer is shown scenes of heartbreaking beauty and disaster in a magnificent use of CG-animation. I never really felt that this series was slapping me over the head with a message: on the contrary, ""Arjuna"" expects you to walk away with your own moral, just as Juna is left to solve her problems on her own.Do not pass this series up - one of the best to come out of Japan recently should not be missed.",5,Simply beautiful..,1037059200,"11 12, 2002",2002,2582,"['was', 'first', 'introduced', 'Earth', 'Girl', 'Arjuna', 'anime', 'club', 'where', 'promptly', 'fell', 'love', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'compelling', 'storyline', 'soon', 'realized', 'was', 'one', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'was', 'enjoying', 'it.The', 'story', 'Arjuna', 'not', 'one', 'everyone', 'will', 'take', 'many', 'people', 'prefer', 'not', 'be', 'confronted', 'realities', 'world', 'live', 'manner', 'Earth', 'Girl', 'Arjuna', 'showcase', 'problems', 'society', 'environment', 'been', 'criticized', 'preachy', 'too', 'Captain', 'Planet-esque', 'many', 'anime', 'fans', 'can', 'not', 'disagree', 'more.The', 'most', 'eloquent', 'review', 'Arjuna', 'have', 'ever', 'read', 'stated', 'Arjuna', 'one', ""'cartoon"", 'meant', 'entertain', 'However', 'ask', 'viewer', 'stop', 'consider', 'one', 'place', 'world', 'deeply', 'ponder', 'things', 'do', 'why', 'do', 'Mark', 'Black', 'Moon', 'Within', 'Arjuna', 'fans', 'most', 'genres', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'like', 'Arjuna', 'social', 'commentary', 'disguised', ""'magical"", 'girl', 'show', 'wherein', 'ordinary', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'given', 'fantastic', 'powers', 'However', 'abilities', 'come', 'Juna', 'main', 'character', 'several', 'unhappy', 'effects', 'first', 'die', 'once', 'ability', 'resonate', 'Earth', 'normal', 'life', 'no', 'longer', 'option', 'Eating', 'fast', 'food', 'hamburger', 'form', 'torture', 'Juna', 'forced', 'see', 'experience', 'process', 'meat', 'was', 'made', 'everywhere', 'Juna', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'giant', 'worms', 'called', 'Raaja', 'are', 'intricately', 'connected', 'pollution', 'societal', 'breakdown', 'Juna', 'family', 'not', 'happily', 'clueless', 'bunch', 'so', 'often', 'seen', 'newly', 'divorced', 'mother', 'can', 'not', 'accept', 'Juna', 'new', 'life', 'breaking', 'down', 'sister', 'nothing', 'do', 'desiring', 'only', 'typical', 'teenage', 'existance', 'father', 'only', 'up', 'once', 'entire', 'series', 'idea', 'how', 'handle', 'child.As', 'Juna', 'deal', 'powers', 'fledgling', 'relationship', 'best', 'friend', 'Tokio', 'great', 'responsiblity', 'thrust', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'called', 'SEED', 'viewer', 'shown', 'scenes', 'heartbreaking', 'beauty', 'disaster', 'magnificent', 'use', 'CG-animation', 'never', 'really', 'felt', 'series', 'was', 'slapping', 'head', 'message', 'contrary', 'Arjuna', 'walk', 'away', 'own', 'moral', 'just', 'Juna', 'left', 'solve', 'problems', 'own.Do', 'not', 'pass', 'series', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'come', 'Japan', 'recently', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']","Arjuna, Vol. 1: Rebirth"
714910,A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,B00006G8FH,"Marc Ruby&#8482; ""The Noh Hare&#8482;""","[1, 1]","In this aptly titled CD, Juna Arioshi (Jun), a young woman who has awakened to an intense awareness of the natural world, finds that her new powers can solve nothing if she is not settled within herself.  She is named after one of the great archers of Indian mythology, and like him is caught in the tension between the need to fight and the need to bring peace.The ecological focus of the series continues, but at a somewhat lower pitch and the first DVDs.  It is still one of the driving themes, but lectures are fewer.  Instead, the plot and characters step into the foreground to get the message across.  In this DVD Jun discovers that her sister is pregnant and seeking an abortion.  This puts Jun in great conflict, and triggers the theme of the effect of ecological abuse on unborn children.  She discovers one of her co-workers at S.E.E.D. has had to pay a terrible price for human indulgence.Much of the story is concerned with the relationship between Jun and Tokio, her boyfriend.  As in the DVD, Jun's new sensitivities and responsibilities interfere with their level of communication.  In addition, Tokio is troubled by how little he has to offer the magically empowered Jun.  Even though they try repeatedly to heal the rift that is growing between them, happiness eludes them.  Nor is this helped by Jun's erstwhile friend Sayuri, who is trying to capture Tokio's attention for herself.With all this going on, the core story line - fight against the wasting of the world seems to step into the background.  But that is illusory.  First we find that the plant where Tokio's estranged father works is about to release a deadly mutated virus into the environment, then Jun must fly to New York City to fight a Raaja.  Finally, Tokyo finds itself on the brink of destruction.This set of episodes is far better balanced than those of the first two DVDs.  Characters develop and deepen as Jun comes to understand the motivations of those around her.  The plot also moves along at a better clip as sub-themes begin to weave together into a strong story.  And the ecological focus integrates better with everything else.  It is unfortunate that it took 11 episodes to get here, but the viewer will find the overall effect is compelling rather than pedantic.  I think the viewer who is looking for more than a mindless tale of monster slaughter will find Arjuna a satisfying series.",5,Cross Purposes,1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,2388,"['aptly', 'titled', 'CD', 'Juna', 'Arioshi', 'Jun', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'awakened', 'intense', 'awareness', 'natural', 'world', 'new', 'powers', 'can', 'solve', 'nothing', 'not', 'settled', 'named', 'one', 'great', 'archers', 'Indian', 'mythology', 'caught', 'tension', 'need', 'fight', 'need', 'bring', 'peace.The', 'ecological', 'focus', 'series', 'somewhat', 'lower', 'pitch', 'first', 'DVDs', 'still', 'one', 'driving', 'themes', 'lectures', 'are', 'fewer', 'Instead', 'plot', 'characters', 'step', 'foreground', 'get', 'message', 'across', 'DVD', 'Jun', 'sister', 'pregnant', 'seeking', 'abortion', 'Jun', 'great', 'conflict', 'theme', 'effect', 'ecological', 'abuse', 'unborn', 'children', 'one', 'co-workers', 'S.E.E.D', 'had', 'pay', 'terrible', 'price', 'human', 'indulgence.Much', 'story', 'concerned', 'relationship', 'Jun', 'Tokio', 'boyfriend', 'DVD', 'Jun', 'new', 'sensitivities', 'responsibilities', 'interfere', 'level', 'communication', 'addition', 'Tokio', 'troubled', 'how', 'little', 'offer', 'magically', 'empowered', 'Jun', 'Even', 'try', 'repeatedly', 'heal', 'rift', 'growing', 'happiness', 'eludes', 'helped', 'Jun', 'erstwhile', 'friend', 'Sayuri', 'who', 'trying', 'capture', 'Tokio', 'attention', 'herself.With', 'going', 'core', 'story', 'line', 'fight', 'wasting', 'world', 'step', 'background', 'illusory', 'First', 'find', 'plant', 'where', 'Tokio', 'estranged', 'father', 'works', 'release', 'deadly', 'mutated', 'virus', 'environment', 'then', 'Jun', 'must', 'fly', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'fight', 'Raaja', 'Finally', 'Tokyo', 'brink', 'destruction.This', 'set', 'episodes', 'far', 'better', 'balanced', 'first', 'two', 'DVDs', 'Characters', 'develop', 'deepen', 'Jun', 'understand', 'motivations', 'plot', 'also', 'along', 'better', 'clip', 'sub-themes', 'begin', 'weave', 'together', 'strong', 'story', 'ecological', 'focus', 'integrates', 'better', 'everything', 'else', 'unfortunate', 'took', '11', 'episodes', 'get', 'here', 'viewer', 'will', 'find', 'overall', 'effect', 'compelling', 'rather', 'pedantic', 'think', 'viewer', 'who', 'looking', 'more', 'mindless', 'tale', 'monster', 'slaughter', 'will', 'find', 'Arjuna', 'satisfying', 'series']","Arjuna, Vol. 1: Rebirth"

714913,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B00006G8FH,Sesho,"[1, 1]","After reading less than stellar reviews about this dvd, the only reason I really picked it up was for the composer of the music, Yoko Kanno, the same genius behind the music of Cowboy Bebop. I figured she wouldn't lend her name to a project that was totally awful. I was pleasantly surprised, with some reservations, by Arjuna Volume 1.Teenager Juna Ariyoshi and her boyfriend, Tokio, are riding his motorcycle to see a beautiful sunset when an accident kills Juna. While she is dead, a mysterious entity known as Chris offers her a deal. He promises to resurrect her in exchange for her becoming the Avatar of Time. You see, Earth has become infested with demons known as Raaja which in time will destroy our planet. It is Juna's task to purify the planet of these spirits in order to save mankind. She won't be alone. There is an organization named S.E.E.D dedicated to saving Earth who will back her up. She also has some weapons, such as a sacred bow, and a protecting spirit she can summon. She'll need him because the Raaja make Godzilla look like a midget. These first three episodes are mainly setup of the story with Arjuna's origin, her first battle, and her struggle to become the proctector of the earth. Struggle, because as is usual in these types of stories, Chris, supposedly her mentor, talks in riddles, and doesn't just come out and tell her everything. Add to this the fact that Tokio is at a loss as to what has happened to the person he loves.I felt like the premise of exorcising spirits from the earth and the appearance of these wraithlike Raaja was very copycat-like of Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within. This wasn't helped by the fact that the Raaja are CG animated just like in FF. The CG of the monster looks very clumsy and out of place in the film.There are some very beautiful scenes in these episodes. It had film quality animation except in the CG Raaja. The soundtrack, as expected, is great. Arjunas's costume takes a little to get used to, a little too Tinkerbell for me, but the series is very good about taking its time to develop her character. It does have a 5.1 Japanese along withEnglish sound. You can also isolate the score. You can also pick up all the volumes in one Arjuna complete collection set.

714914,A2L4XGVPR42KHL,B00006G8FH,"Therabbitssing ""on the rock that spews lava..""","[0, 0]","Earth Maiden Arjuna is the latest entry in the anime field from legendary Shoji Kawamori (Macross, Escaflowne).  It encompasses an environmental theme, with the premise of a young girl being given a second chance at life, if she will protect the earth as the &quot;Avatar of Time&quot;.  While I sort of questioned the plot at first, the first 3 episodes on the disc quickly changed my mind.We are quickly introduced to Juna, a young high school girl who struggles in life and archery.  After she is involved in a motorcycle accident and is in the hospital unconcious, she is approached by a strange apparition who grants her her life in exchange for taking up the fight against strange creatures called the Raaja.  Not really knowing what she is getting into, Juna accepts and is thrust into a world she simply does not understand.  With the help of the former Avatar of Time, a seemingly lifeless boy in a wheelchair, Chris, and a mysterious organization known as S.E.E.D., Juna begins to accept the life she will now lead.  One of the funnier moments is when oridinary people (her boyfriend) see Juna fighting the Raaja, as they cannot see what she sees, and only see a girl talking and performing strange movements to no one.The animation is eye dropping, with a mix of hand drawn and CG work, the template of what will be used in Kawamori's upcoming Macross Zero OAV series.  Music is done by none other than Yoko Kanno (Macross Plus, Cowboy Bebop)and her music as usual is glorious and really fits the subject matter well. This DVD features great sound, with a 5.1 mix for both Japanese and English tracks...I didn't listen to the dub version, so I cannot comment on it,  but the Japanese mix sounds fantastic, especially with Kanno's music in 5.1 Dolby Digital glory.I enjoyed these 1st 3 episodes,and I eagerly await the next disc in this series.",4,Another gem from Kawamori...,1035504000,"10 25, 2002",2002,1854,"['Earth', 'Maiden', 'Arjuna', 'latest', 'entry', 'anime', 'field', 'legendary', 'Shoji', 'Kawamori', 'Macross', 'Escaflowne', 'environmental', 'theme', 'premise', 'young', 'girl', 'being', 'given', 'second', 'chance', 'life', 'will', 'protect', 'earth', 'quot', 'Avatar', 'Time', 'quot', 'sort', 'questioned', 'plot', 'first', 'first', '3', 'episodes', 'disc', 'quickly', 'changed', 'mind.We', 'are', 'quickly', 'introduced', 'Juna', 'young', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'who', 'life', 'archery', 'involved', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'hospital', 'unconcious', 'approached', 'strange', 'apparition', 'who', 'life', 'exchange', 'taking', 'up', 'fight', 'strange', 'creatures', 'called', 'Raaja', 'Not', 'really', 'knowing', 'what', 'getting', 'Juna', 'accepts', 'thrust', 'world', 'simply', 'not', 'understand', 'help', 'former', 'Avatar', 'Time', 'seemingly', 'lifeless', 'boy', 'wheelchair', 'Chris', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'known', 'S.E.E.D.', 'Juna', 'accept', 'life', 'will', 'now', 'lead', 'One', 'funnier', 'moments', 'when', 'oridinary', 'people', 'boyfriend', 'see', 'Juna', 'fighting', 'Raaja', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'only', 'see', 'girl', 'talking', 'performing', 'strange', 'movements', 'one.The', 'animation', 'eye', 'dropping', 'mix', 'hand', 'drawn', 'CG', 'work', 'template', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'Kawamori', 'upcoming', 'Macross', 'Zero', 'OAV', 'series', 'Music', 'done', 'none', 'other', 'Yoko', 'Kanno', 'Macross', 'Plus', 'Cowboy', 'Bebop', 'music', 'usual', 'glorious', 'really', 'subject', 'matter', 'well', 'DVD', 'great', 'sound', '5.1', 'mix', 'Japanese', 'English', 'tracks', 'did', ""n't"", 'listen', 'dub', 'version', 'can', 'not', 'comment', 'Japanese', 'mix', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'Kanno', 'music', '5.1', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'glory.I', 'enjoyed', '1st', '3', 'episodes', 'eagerly', 'await', 'next', 'disc', 'series']","Arjuna, Vol. 1: Rebirth"
