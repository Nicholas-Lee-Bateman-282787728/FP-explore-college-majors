A man lands in the middle of nowhere, takes a bus ride into a city that is visually nice with no color.  He is given an apartment, an office job as an accountant.  He adapts to the unusual environment where all seems ok, no problems, everyone is happy.  Norwegian director has given the viewer an amazing visual of the surroundings.  Immediately, the viewer senses that something is different here, complete sterility, no color, no children, no smells, no problems.We are not sure if this is a dreamscape, purgatory, heaven, bizarro world, etc., etc.  Whatever or wherever it be, do not try to make complete comprehension of this movie with suicides, bloody and graphic images.  You can only make sense of it if you decide why is the protagonist there, why the attempted suicides, why the discoveries.  Many will interpret this film in their own way.  To me, it is strange, quirky, bizarre, unimaginable, etc., etc.,This film distributed by Film Movement an organization that brings Award winning wonderful foreign film with great acting, good directing, and very interesting stories.  ....Rizzo",3,If you like this kind of bizarro world goings on....you might understand it,1302998400,"04 17, 2011",2011,1209,"['film', 'labeled', 'black', 'comedy', 'found', 'stretch', 'black', 'satire', 'maybe', 'surely', 'not', 'comedy', 'man', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'bus', 'ride', 'city', 'visually', 'nice', 'color', 'given', 'apartment', 'office', 'job', 'accountant', 'unusual', 'environment', 'where', 'ok', 'problems', 'everyone', 'happy', 'Norwegian', 'director', 'given', 'viewer', 'amazing', 'visual', 'surroundings', 'Immediately', 'viewer', 'something', 'different', 'here', 'complete', 'sterility', 'color', 'children', 'smells', 'problems.We', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'dreamscape', 'purgatory', 'heaven', 'bizarro', 'world', 'etc.', 'etc', 'wherever', 'be', 'do', 'not', 'try', 'make', 'complete', 'comprehension', 'movie', 'suicides', 'bloody', 'graphic', 'images', 'can', 'only', 'make', 'sense', 'decide', 'why', 'protagonist', 'there', 'why', 'attempted', 'suicides', 'why', 'discoveries', 'Many', 'will', 'interpret', 'film', 'own', 'way', 'strange', 'quirky', 'bizarre', 'unimaginable', 'etc.', 'etc.', 'film', 'distributed', 'Film', 'Movement', 'organization', 'Award', 'winning', 'wonderful', 'foreign', 'film', 'great', 'acting', 'good', 'directing', 'very', 'interesting', 'stories', '.Rizzo']",The Bothersome Man

1062060,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000O3C5DS,Andres C. Salama,"[25, 26]","This Norwegian film starts with a man jumping over the subway, apparently commiting suicide. But the next scene shows him arriving in a lonely bus into a desert. There he meets a man, and is shipped off to a mysterious city, where he starts working in an aseptic modern office as an accountant. The coworkers seem nice, if emotionless, and he soon meets a woman who becomes his girlfriend, yet the city seems utterly strange, as the food has no taste, alcohol doesn't make you drunk, and there's nary a children around. Is this a dream, or is he in paradise, or in hell?. While at times, the films looks as extended episode of The Twilight Zone (even at ninety minutes, the movie seems a bit long), it is quite thought provoking. The best scenes are those in which the exaggeration is minimal, as when the people engage in banal conversations about interior decoration, and recoil at discussing deeper issues. I always thought there was something inhuman in advanced capitalist societies, in the way they try to repress the basic urges of human nature. And this movie is best when it devastatingly critiques this life style. Unfortunately, the movie is a bit too long, and the director doesn't seem to know how to end it, but most for of the running time this is very much worth seeing.",4,Provocative Norwegian film is worth seeing,1207872000,"04 11, 2008",2008,1286,"['Norwegian', 'film', 'man', 'jumping', 'subway', 'apparently', 'commiting', 'suicide', 'next', 'scene', 'arriving', 'lonely', 'bus', 'desert', 'man', 'shipped', 'off', 'mysterious', 'city', 'where', 'working', 'aseptic', 'modern', 'office', 'accountant', 'coworkers', 'seem', 'nice', 'emotionless', 'soon', 'woman', 'who', 'girlfriend', 'city', 'utterly', 'strange', 'food', 'taste', 'alcohol', ""n't"", 'make', 'drunk', 'nary', 'children', 'dream', 'paradise', 'hell', 'times', 'films', 'extended', 'episode', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'even', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'movie', 'bit', 'long', 'quite', 'thought', 'provoking', 'best', 'scenes', 'are', 'exaggeration', 'minimal', 'when', 'people', 'engage', 'banal', 'conversations', 'interior', 'decoration', 'recoil', 'discussing', 'deeper', 'issues', 'always', 'thought', 'was', 'something', 'inhuman', 'advanced', 'capitalist', 'societies', 'way', 'try', 'repress', 'basic', 'urges', 'human', 'nature', 'movie', 'best', 'when', 'devastatingly', 'life', 'style', 'Unfortunately', 'movie', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'director', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'how', 'end', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'very', 'much', 'seeing']",The Bothersome Man

While America was just coming out of its Hollywood shell, Sweden was enamoured over its gem in Ingmar Bergman--who was pondering man's relationship between himself, his self image, his society, and his god--and Norway's Nils Christensen's idea of a light comedy incorporated crazy mothers, ailing fathers, and unwanted love children. You could say that the regions been in an existential crisis for the past 50 years while these issues are still creeping into the American unconcious.Enter The Bothersome Man. Andreas enters into a world without risk. He has job security, marital security, and physical security; but he sacrifices the enjoyment that this windfall should afford him. In a way it's the quintessential American movie: in order to get ahead in life you have to be willing to take risks.

1062066,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B000O3C5DS,Eric Sanberg,"[6, 6]","Our main character, Andreas, offs himself by jumping in front of a train. Next thing you know he's on a bus to a way station where he's escorted to a new apartment and a waiting job. Everything is at an easy pace. Money is no problem, work load is light, his apartment is nice if but a bit austere and everyone he meets is pleasant.But that seems to be the problem with everything. There are no highs or lows. There are no children around and everyone he sees or works with is about his age. No one is too fat or too skinny. No one is too tall or too short. All the colors are muted and all the furniture is minimalist. The food is bland and he can drink liquor till the cows come home and he isn't going to get drunk. Even the act of sex seems to be bland and unfulfilling.There is much more to this but I don't wish to spoil.This is a quirky idea. I'm not sure he's in Hell, (a point which is underlined by the final scene) but he's in no place I'd like to be. This is a film from the Icelandic Film Company but I believe it's really Swedish or Norwegian. I'm also wondering if they aren't making a statement about their society. That they are a totally even-keeled society that has lost all sense of adventure and passion. The opening scene shows Andreas in an underground train station. The only other people there are a youngish couple doing some heavy mouth to mouth. But their eyes are open and there seems to be no real passion. Just a going through the motions sort of thing. That's when he does himself in.The concept is so good I wouldn't be surprised if the script wrote itself. This is a very well realized movie. The set, costumes, color schemes must have been easy to put together. It's shot well, acted well and has a very good musical score. If there is a reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it makes so much sense so quickly. You pretty much get what is going on early in the movie, so each new scene does little more than underscore what you already know. The reason you keep watching is to see how things will resolve themselves. I'm very curious as to how viewers will read the final scene.Being a foreign, subtitled film, it certainly won't be for everyone.

1062073,A1WY1U223QB0IB,B000O3C5DS,"R. Hawk ""Jubal_Early""","[1, 1]","I just saw the film yesterday and I will admit its disturbing and not light entertainment in some respects, so it should not be looked at as a casual film to be viewed over popcorn with friends on a sunny afternoon. This film attempts to make you think about the meaning of life, and if you don't question your own existence to some degree after seeing it, then you've problaby missed its dystopian ""point"" so to speak. So though I am rating it five stars, that's for philosophical promptings it creates, not strictly for entertainment value.The final scene for me is the crux of the entire film, along with the scene where he almost escapes to the ""higher"" sensory realm so to speak - maybe the ""real"" world that he came from...Ultimately, that is the whole question of the film. Not what is the point of the life they are all living in this gray existence, but the point of life period, regardless of how harsh or pleasant it may be.It all seems to tie into the idea of simulated universes/realities and the idea of parallel worlds, an endless existence from one to another, which is ultimately far more disturbing than just being trapped in one existence alone for eternity. Where does it all end? Should it all end? Is there a way to go on eternally without at some point seeking death, regardless of how good your existence may be?The homogenous Norwegian lifestyle is obviously a good backdrop for a film of this type, but we all have elements of this conformity and mundane existence regardless of where we live.I found the ending was a way to placate the character, to give him the opposite of what he was first presented with, in order to bring him peace of mind. However, how I would have liked to see more of this new world they sent him to!!But why not let him escape to the world of brilliant music as well? That's one of the major unanswered questions of the film. I think if I were in this character's shoes, not being a violent person, but in this case, I would have done anything to actually see that world of music - killed those trying to pull me away from it, knocked down the tunnel behind me, anything. What else is existence for, but to strive for this sort of paradise, and if it proves not to be a paradise, for something better still?All the old people in the building, what were they waiting for? If you don't die, but grow old...would they at some point try to reopen the crack in the wall?All in all, very thought provoking in a dystopian, depressing way. What is hell, what is heaven? Can we decide this for ourselves?Seeing him pick himself up after repeated subway accidents, his girlfriend not even flinch at his appearance...

1062074,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B000O3C5DS,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Den Brysomme Mannen (The Bothersome Man) (Jens Lien, 2006)Den Brysomme Mannen, released in English as The Bothersome Man, is a movie that, I confess, I started watching a few weeks ago and shut off in the middle. It gets a lot of good press among people I respect, so I was wondering if I was simply missing out on whatever it is that made them praise it so much. You see, the first half of this movie is boring. Immensely, mind-shatteringly boring. Lien obviously subscribes to the James Joyce method (a term I use in re: ""The Dead"", as in ""if you want to write a story about boring people, write a boring story""). And I can understand why he sets it up like this; he's trying to show that life in this nameless city where Andreas (Lilyhammer's Trond Fausa Aurvaag) finds himself ends up driving him to make the decisions he makes in the much superior second half of the movie. But, my fillets of lutefisk, man, did you have to make it that boring?Plot: Andreas, in the film's opening scene, is standing on a train platform. The only other people there are a scary-looking couple who are entirely engrossed in one another. He throws himself off...and then we cut to him riding a bus in the middle of nowhere. Has he committed suicide and is now on his way to the afterlife? Is this a flashback to ""how I got here""? We don't know. (While the specifics are eventually revealed, here's a SPOILER ALERT for you: even after Lien shows us the details, we're still not sure. It's one of the movie's moments of real brilliance.) In any case, Andreas is dropped off at a little filling station, where he's picked up by a very old car and taken to what, on the surface, seems like the perfect city--every inhabitant's needs are completely met, everyone has a job that seems perfect for him, etc. (If this sounds familiar, it should; writer Per Schreiner, turning in his first feature script, was obviously influenced by such classic conform-or-die scenarios as Camazotz and Metropolis.) But Andreas soon notices that with this contentment comes a discontent that, seemingly, only he is capable of noticing--everything is flat. Food has no taste, the atmosphere has no smell. He wonders if it's just him until a chance encounter in a restaurant men's room makes him realize that's not the case, and for the next few weeks he tries to battle the growing disenchantment he feels at knowing he's not the only one who notices this......at which point we get into spoiler territory. Which sucks, because that's the exact point when this movie starts getting very, very good. And I can't tell you why, because the pivotal decision Andreas makes exactly halfway through the film is, as far as this movie goes, the spoiler to end all spoilers. It's also the gateway to the movie's funniest scenes and the plot really taking off--it's here that the movie stops seeming like ""The Dead"" and heads into the territory of such wonderful dystopian worlds as Delicatessen, of which the second half of this movie put me in mind more than once for no reason I can quite put my finger on.If the entire film had been as good as the second half is, I'd be calling it an instant classic and adding it pretty high up in my top 1000 movies of all time list. Unfortunately, however, you have to get through the first half to get to the second. ** ",3,Great second half dragged down by not-so-great first.,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3312,"['Den', 'Brysomme', 'Mannen', 'Bothersome', 'Man', 'Jens', 'Lien', '2006', 'Den', 'Brysomme', 'Mannen', 'released', 'English', 'Bothersome', 'Man', 'movie', 'confess', 'started', 'watching', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'shut', 'off', 'middle', 'lot', 'good', 'press', 'people', 'respect', 'was', 'wondering', 'was', 'simply', 'missing', 'out', 'made', 'praise', 'so', 'much', 'see', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'boring', 'Immensely', 'mind-shatteringly', 'boring', 'Lien', 'obviously', 'James', 'Joyce', 'method', 'term', 'use', 're', 'Dead', 'want', 'write', 'story', 'boring', 'people', 'write', 'boring', 'story', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'up', 'trying', 'show', 'life', 'nameless', 'city', 'where', 'Andreas', 'Lilyhammer', 'Trond', 'Fausa', 'Aurvaag', 'up', 'driving', 'make', 'decisions', 'much', 'superior', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'fillets', 'lutefisk', 'man', 'did', 'have', 'make', 'boring', 'Plot', 'Andreas', 'film', 'opening', 'scene', 'standing', 'train', 'platform', 'only', 'other', 'people', 'are', 'scary-looking', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'entirely', 'engrossed', 'one', 'then', 'cut', 'riding', 'bus', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'committed', 'suicide', 'now', 'way', 'afterlife', 'flashback', 'how', 'got', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'specifics', 'are', 'eventually', 'revealed', 'here', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT', 'even', 'Lien', 'details', ""'re"", 'still', 'not', 'sure', 'one', 'movie', 'moments', 'real', 'brilliance', 'case', 'Andreas', 'dropped', 'off', 'little', 'filling', 'station', 'where', 'picked', 'up', 'very', 'old', 'car', 'taken', 'what', 'surface', 'perfect', 'city', 'inhabitant', 'needs', 'are', 'completely', 'met', 'everyone', 'job', 'perfect', 'etc', 'familiar', 'should', 'writer', 'Per', 'Schreiner', 'turning', 'first', 'feature', 'script', 'was', 'obviously', 'influenced', 'such', 'classic', 'conform-or-die', 'scenarios', 'Camazotz', 'Metropolis', 'Andreas', 'soon', 'contentment', 'discontent', 'seemingly', 'only', 'capable', 'noticing', 'everything', 'flat', 'Food', 'taste', 'atmosphere', 'smell', 'just', 'chance', 'encounter', 'restaurant', 'men', 'room', 'realize', 'not', 'case', 'next', 'few', 'weeks', 'battle', 'growing', 'disenchantment', 'knowing', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'point', 'get', 'spoiler', 'territory', 'Which', 'sucks', 'exact', 'point', 'when', 'movie', 'getting', 'very', 'very', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'why', 'pivotal', 'decision', 'Andreas', 'exactly', 'halfway', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'movie', 'spoiler', 'end', 'spoilers', 'also', 'gateway', 'movie', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'plot', 'really', 'taking', 'off', 'here', 'movie', 'seeming', 'Dead', 'heads', 'territory', 'such', 'wonderful', 'dystopian', 'worlds', 'Delicatessen', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'put', 'mind', 'more', 'once', 'reason', 'can', 'quite', 'put', 'finger', 'entire', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'half', ""'d"", 'be', 'calling', 'instant', 'classic', 'adding', 'pretty', 'high', 'up', 'top', '1000', 'movies', 'time', 'list', 'Unfortunately', 'however', 'have', 'get', 'first', 'half', 'get', 'second', '**']",The Bothersome Man

1062076,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000O3C5DS,William Timothy Lukeman,"[2, 2]","This darkly satiric film is certainly open to more than one interpretation, from the social to the metaphysical ... and all of them would be applicable, I think. But for me, it especially works as a commentary on the superficial slickness of modern society, where everyone gets along by sticking to the surface, playing their roles as expected & being so very nice & civil. But not really civilized, I fear, because the passion & depth that define true civilization are both completely missing in this clean, neat city, which looks as if it sprang to (pseudo)life right out of the ads in a luxury magazine. It all looks wonderful at first ... but the food has no flavor, the settings have no color, and even the sex is mechanical & unsatisfying.While most of the city's citizens -- or consuming units, really -- seem perfectly happy with this situation, newcomer Andreas doesn't quite fit in, no matter how much he tries at first. And when he becomes aware of a crack in a basement wall, where he can smell freshly baked bread & hear lovely music & glimpse golden sunlight ... well, that's it for him. He's desperate to escape his sterile surroundings for something genuine & authentic. But will that be allowed by the rest of the city?I won't spoil what happens next. Suffice it to say that Kafka, among others, would recognize this territory, which is the glossy & empty facade of the consumer life, where all is surface & there's no substance. Yet so many people are vaguely content with this pale approximation of an inwardly rich & real life -- and those who can't accept the sugary lie are often ostracized for it.
