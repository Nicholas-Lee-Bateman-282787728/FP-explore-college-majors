It's kind of like a live actionScooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete First and Second Seasons-- especially during the musical ""romp"" numbers.Anyway, I didn't really remember the show too much except for the theme song and that a friend of mine used to make me watch it when I'd go over to her house -- although it was on repeats as this was in the 70s. I bought this Season 1 set when it was re-released and way cheaper than the previous edition, but it took me a while to watch it.While convalescing from surgery, I decided to watch and after the first show I couldn't stop. Each show is formulaic in that the Monkees end up getting into some kind of trouble, usually having to do with Davy and a love interest, and showcases their music. And although it can be predictable, it's great fun just to watch and they seem like they're having a good time.All 32 episode are on 6 one-sided DVDs with DVD set liner notes on the box by Andrew Sandoval, and episode synopsis with air dates. Clarity and color are pretty decent, though slightly washed out with a warmish tint, but it doesn't interfere with viewing pleasure.*****  EXTRAS  ****** The Monkees On Tour -- 25:16-minutes --[Individual commentary by either Bobby Hart (song-writer), Peter Tork, or Mike Nesmith]According to the box's episode information this was actually the last show of the season airing on 4/24/67. I list it here because it shows the behind-the-scenes of the Monkees getting ready for a real concert and seems out of place from the rest of the episodes. It's great to watch, but you really have a hard time actually hearing any of the music or singing because the screaming fans is all you hear (now I know what the Beatles meant).* 16-mm Pilot Of The Monkees -- 24:48-minutes -- B&W; and ColorAt the beginning is a black and white interview/screen-test of Davy Jones and Mike Nesmith. Then the pilot begins and it sounds like Peter Tork is singing the Monkees theme song. It has a slower tempo, but it might be song writers Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart that's heard on this episode. According to Hart's interview (included) their voices were used on the pilot, but once it was sold to the network, the actual Monkees re-dubbed the voices. It sounds like Tork to me.* Monkees Commericals -- 05:50-minutesVarious commercials featuring sponsors Kellogg's and Yardley ""Black Label"" Cologne (I wonder what that smelled like?). Also one TV spot for the show.* Interview With Song Writer Bobby Hart -- 24:11-minutes (present day)Hart discusses writing the music for the Monkees and going on tour with them. He also discusses the various Monkees reunions.* Monkee Memorabilia -- StillsVarious pictures and publicity stills and magazine articles on the group. Also, interoffice memos of actors who auditioned for parts in the Monkees (and for the roles of each Monkee) including remarks like ""too old"" or ""pass"" etc., and it also contains bio information and press releases.* Romps -- These are the musical numbers that play in the episode and you can choose to watch them alone.Although there is no ""Play-All"" feature for the episodes, you have to select each episode by itself, you get other extras like trivia and select commentaries. And the menus are cool.I highly recommend THE MONKEES SEASON 1.

Although the first season is not nearly as good as the second (where the wackiness became downright inspired) it is still a lot of fun and contains some terrific music.Season one episodes include: Here Come the Monkees, One Many Shy, Two Many Girls, Alias Mickey Dolenz, Monkee Mother, Monkees on Tour (with lots of great live music), Captain Crocodile and many others spread out over 6 discs. There were 32 episodes in the first season, and 25 in the second. My five all-time favorite episodes are all in the second season, so if you're new to the show you might want to wait for the second season release on DVD.These cute shows are suitable for the whole family; in fact when I recently lent 3 of my videos to a 15 year friend she watched them 4 times over in 3 days. The music is perfect 60's pop, and songs in this season include ""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"", ""Steppin' Stone"", ""I'm a Believer"", the beautiful ""I Wanna Be Free"" and my favorite Monkees song, ""You Just May Be the One"", written by Mike Nesmith.A good show that was occasionally great, and a thousand cheers for Rhino for releasing the DVDs.GRADE: B+ (And check out that cool packaging!)",4,"""Your eyes are like cupcakes, in a sea of sour cream...""",1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,1258,"['Awesome', 'finally', 'get', 'see', 'woefully', 'underappreciated', 'series', 'DVD', 'first', 'season', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'second', 'where', 'wackiness', 'became', 'downright', 'inspired', 'still', 'lot', 'fun', 'terrific', 'music.Season', 'one', 'include', 'Here', 'Come', 'Monkees', 'One', 'Many', 'Shy', 'Two', 'Many', 'Girls', 'Alias', 'Mickey', 'Dolenz', 'Monkee', 'Mother', 'Monkees', 'Tour', 'lots', 'great', 'live', 'music', 'Captain', 'Crocodile', 'many', 'others', 'spread', '6', 'discs', 'were', '32', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', '25', 'second', 'five', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episodes', 'are', 'second', 'season', 'so', ""'re"", 'new', 'show', 'might', 'want', 'wait', 'second', 'season', 'release', 'DVD.These', 'cute', 'shows', 'are', 'suitable', 'whole', 'family', 'fact', 'when', 'recently', 'lent', '3', 'videos', '15', 'year', 'friend', 'watched', '4', 'times', '3', 'days', 'music', 'perfect', '60', 'pop', 'songs', 'season', 'include', 'Last', 'Train', 'Clarksville', 'Pleasant', 'Valley', 'Sunday', 'Steppin', 'Stone', ""'m"", 'Believer', 'beautiful', 'Wan', 'na', 'Be', 'Free', 'favorite', 'Monkees', 'song', 'Just', 'May', 'Be', 'One', 'written', 'Mike', 'Nesmith.A', 'good', 'show', 'was', 'occasionally', 'great', 'thousand', 'cheers', 'Rhino', 'releasing', 'DVDs.GRADE', 'B+', 'check', 'out', 'cool', 'packaging']",The Monkees: Season 1
723696,A3NUA12GI8OFU1,B00006ZZ05,Colin Klein,"[236, 250]","What do you actually get for shelling out this much money?Here are the good things to say about this set, and Rhino's work on it:1. They actually released it, and it has all the episodes of the first season included in order, with the original songs, and in vibrant color. This earns it most of the points, and is the only real reason to buy this.2. It includes commercials, and the pilot episode with Boyce & Hart singing the soundtrack, and text trivia screens about each episode.Here is what I see wrong with this set in no particular order:The commercials and Boyce & Hart pilot are pretty bad quality copies. The box set video, while mostly vibrant throughout, still includes dust and hairs sometimes. The audio quality never gets above mediocre, and sometimes is either tinny and harsh, or muddy and mushy. The Rhino Monkee audio CDs sound terrific, as do most Rhino CDs. I have not been at all impressed with any Rhino audio on other DVDs so far, and  these DVD 5.1 soundtracks are worthless--and the mono isn't much better. Why couldn't they have just done a decent plain stereo mix from the master tapes Rhino had access to for all the Monkee CDs?I agree with a previous review comparing what was done with the old Beatles Anthology audio and video, and should have been done on this set. The volume levels are all over the place in this set too. The dialog is mostly quiet so you crank it up to hear, and then the romp music is too much louder. But what is really bad, the menu music level just blasts in comparison to the episodes. So, because you can't just set it to play all the episodes at once, the menu comes back after each one and you turn it down while the menu plays, then turn it back up for the episodes, and so on, very annoying.No commentary from Dolenz, but if he had as little to say as what is included from the others, we're not missing much. This is some of the most boring and uninformative commentary you will ever sit through. As implied in other reviews, basically any of us could have given these commentaries (many of you much better)--and we weren't even there! You may as well say there is no booklet either, something this small and uninformative in a set this big, at this cost, is unbelievable. The Monkee CD booklets put this to shame.The most outragious aspect of this set, and the single reason Rhino so overpriced it for what little work they actually seemed to put into the episodes--the packaging. We are paying for AIR.  The expensive (probably about a third of the cost at least) 3 inch deep box holding six discs and a booklet that are 3/4 inches deep. That's 2 1/4 inches of premium wasted shelf space for air. The cute sleeves inside don't protect the discs, they scuff them sliding in and out--so you have to supply your own safe way to store them yourself. Nice way to give people value for their money Rhino.Yeah, I'll still get season two reluctantly when it comes out--because I want all the episodes. But I hate rewarding Rhino anymore for lackluster work packaged in an over-sized, overpriced, impractical holder.We deserve better, and I feel we have already paid for better, but didn't get it.",3,"OK, Let's be realistic about this!",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",2003,3153,"['What', 'do', 'actually', 'get', 'shelling', 'out', 'much', 'money', 'Here', 'are', 'good', 'things', 'say', 'set', 'Rhino', 'work', 'it:1', 'actually', 'released', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'included', 'order', 'original', 'songs', 'vibrant', 'color', 'most', 'points', 'only', 'real', 'reason', 'buy', 'this.2', 'commercials', 'pilot', 'episode', 'Boyce', 'Hart', 'singing', 'soundtrack', 'text', 'trivia', 'screens', 'episode.Here', 'what', 'see', 'wrong', 'set', 'particular', 'order', 'commercials', 'Boyce', 'Hart', 'pilot', 'are', 'pretty', 'bad', 'quality', 'copies', 'box', 'set', 'video', 'mostly', 'vibrant', 'still', 'dust', 'hairs', 'sometimes', 'audio', 'quality', 'never', 'mediocre', 'sometimes', 'tinny', 'harsh', 'muddy', 'mushy', 'Rhino', 'Monkee', 'audio', 'CDs', 'sound', 'terrific', 'do', 'most', 'Rhino', 'CDs', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'impressed', 'Rhino', 'audio', 'other', 'DVDs', 'far', 'DVD', '5.1', 'soundtracks', 'are', 'worthless', 'mono', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'done', 'decent', 'plain', 'stereo', 'mix', 'master', 'tapes', 'Rhino', 'had', 'access', 'Monkee', 'CDs', 'agree', 'previous', 'review', 'comparing', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'old', 'Beatles', 'Anthology', 'audio', 'video', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'set', 'volume', 'levels', 'are', 'place', 'set', 'too', 'dialog', 'mostly', 'quiet', 'crank', 'up', 'hear', 'then', 'romp', 'music', 'too', 'much', 'louder', 'what', 'really', 'bad', 'menu', 'music', 'level', 'just', 'blasts', 'comparison', 'episodes', 'So', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'set', 'play', 'episodes', 'once', 'menu', 'back', 'one', 'turn', 'down', 'menu', 'plays', 'then', 'turn', 'back', 'up', 'episodes', 'so', 'very', 'annoying.No', 'commentary', 'Dolenz', 'had', 'as', 'little', 'say', 'what', 'included', 'others', ""'re"", 'not', 'missing', 'much', 'most', 'boring', 'uninformative', 'commentary', 'will', 'ever', 'sit', 'through', 'implied', 'other', 'reviews', 'basically', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'commentaries', 'many', 'much', 'better', 'were', ""n't"", 'even', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'say', 'booklet', 'either', 'something', 'small', 'uninformative', 'set', 'big', 'cost', 'unbelievable', 'Monkee', 'CD', 'put', 'shame.The', 'most', 'outragious', 'aspect', 'set', 'single', 'reason', 'Rhino', 'so', 'overpriced', 'what', 'little', 'work', 'actually', 'seemed', 'put', 'episodes', 'packaging', 'are', 'paying', 'AIR', 'expensive', 'probably', 'third', 'cost', 'least', '3', 'inch', 'deep', 'box', 'holding', 'six', 'discs', 'booklet', 'are', '3/4', 'inches', 'deep', '2', '1/4', 'inches', 'premium', 'wasted', 'shelf', 'space', 'air', 'cute', 'sleeves', 'inside', 'do', ""n't"", 'protect', 'discs', 'scuff', 'sliding', 'have', 'supply', 'own', 'safe', 'way', 'store', 'Nice', 'way', 'give', 'people', 'value', 'money', 'Rhino.Yeah', ""'ll"", 'still', 'get', 'season', 'two', 'reluctantly', 'when', 'out', 'want', 'episodes', 'hate', 'rewarding', 'Rhino', 'anymore', 'lackluster', 'work', 'packaged', 'over-sized', 'overpriced', 'impractical', 'holder.We', 'deserve', 'better', 'feel', 'have', 'already', 'paid', 'better', 'did', ""n't"", 'get']",The Monkees: Season 1

It will fit on any shelf I have in my house, including some that regular DVD's are too tall for.  So it is not as tall as the others, so what?  Moving on to what's important.When you open the box there are six sleeves, each containing a disc.  This can be a problem if you don't know how to treat things.  I recommed before sliding a disc back into the sleeve that you make sure there are no loose materials inside the sleeve that will rub against the finish of the DVD and scratch it.  That is really all that can happen, otherwise it's 100% perfect.  Hint or word to the wise; Don't eat around your DVD's anyway and you won't drop foreign particles into the sleeves or get grease on the cardboard.The extra minute of footage not originally aired on some of the episodes was completely amazing to see.

723703,A535J638VSYI,B00006ZZ05,Frev,"[20, 22]","This DVD boxset of the Monkees' TV series first season is beautifully designed to resemble an old carry-around record player from the 1960's, which I actually owned at one time, even showing the record speeds at 33, 45 and 78 rpms! The six discs are packaged in cardboard replicas of some of the original Monkees 45 picture sleeves, including a few import sleeves, a very cool touch from Rhino. The only problem I see with them is that the DVDs might tend to slip out too easily from the sleeves and get damaged, so I'd advise everyone who buys the set to be careful how they handle the discs.The booklet has some photos and interesting information on the Monkees first season, but it's very thin and not nearly as nice and colorful as the booklet from the VHS version of the box set of the entire series.A sampling of some of the shows on DVD has them in pristine condition, the best I've ever seen them. There are special audio commentaries spread out on some of the episodes on the discs by Bob Rafelson, Michael Nesmith, Davy Jones and Peter Tork. (I guess Micky Dolenz was too busy to comment on some of the episodes, a pity, would have loved to hear what he thought of 'Monkees at the Circus'. Maybe he'll record some commentaries when Season 2 is released on DVD.)The sixth disc has the most bonus material, including the 16mm version of the original Monkees pilot with Boyce &amp; Hart singing the songs, an interview by Bobby Hart, a gallery of photos and rare memorabilia, audio commentary by Mike and Peter on the 'Monkees on Tour' episode, and original Monkees commercials, though some of the commercials looked like they came from video dupes, a pity Rhino couldn't seem to find original film sources.Overall, this is an excellent presentation of the first season of the Monkees, beautifully produced and packaged. Hopefully, Season 2 on DVD will be just as handsomely produced. Suggestions I'd make to Rhino for the Second Season box set is to definitely include the '33 &amp; 1/3' TV special (and please Rhino, marry the better video picture from the VHS box set with the better sound of the single tape release of the special), the 1976 'Dolenz, Jones, Boyce &amp; Hart' special, the 1997 'Hey Hey, It's The Monkees' TV special, the Rhino produced 'Hey Hey, We're The Monkees' documentary, some of the Monkees rare late 1960's TV appearances, like Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, Hollywood Squares and others, more rare commercials, including the Kool Aid commercials, which were the last things Nesmith did with the Monkees before he quit.Also, if any rare outtakes exist from the show, they must be included, and get commentaries on some of the episodes from all four Monkees, I definitely want to hear Micky's commentary on 'The Frodis Caper', the episode he directed. What would also be nice would be to include the videos the Monkees did in the 1980's for 'That Was Then, This Is Now', 'Heart &amp; Soul', 'Every Step Of The Way', and the 'Justus' videos as well. Rhino should make the second box set as complete as possible, with a thicker booklet filled with rare photos and show information to make it appealing to the fans. If the second season box set comes out by Christmas, I definitely want to see it under my tree.Kudos to Rhino for putting together a really great DVD set that does justice to the first season of the Monkees TV series.",5,The Monkees First Season Done Right!,1052870400,"05 14, 2003",2003,3362,"['DVD', 'boxset', 'Monkees', 'TV', 'series', 'first', 'season', 'beautifully', 'designed', 'resemble', 'old', 'carry-around', 'record', 'player', '1960', 'actually', 'owned', 'one', 'time', 'even', 'showing', 'record', '33', '45', '78', 'rpms', 'six', 'discs', 'are', 'packaged', 'cardboard', 'replicas', 'original', 'Monkees', '45', 'picture', 'sleeves', 'including', 'few', 'import', 'sleeves', 'very', 'cool', 'touch', 'Rhino', 'only', 'problem', 'see', 'DVDs', 'might', 'tend', 'slip', 'out', 'too', 'easily', 'sleeves', 'get', 'damaged', ""'d"", 'advise', 'everyone', 'who', 'set', 'be', 'careful', 'how', 'handle', 'discs.The', 'booklet', 'photos', 'interesting', 'information', 'Monkees', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'thin', 'not', 'nearly', 'nice', 'colorful', 'booklet', 'VHS', 'version', 'box', 'set', 'entire', 'series.A', 'sampling', 'shows', 'DVD', 'pristine', 'condition', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'are', 'special', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'spread', 'out', 'episodes', 'discs', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'Michael', 'Nesmith', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'Peter', 'Tork', 'guess', 'Micky', 'Dolenz', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'comment', 'episodes', 'pity', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'hear', 'what', 'thought', ""'Monkees"", 'Circus', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'record', 'commentaries', 'when', 'Season', '2', 'released', 'DVD', 'sixth', 'disc', 'most', 'bonus', 'material', 'including', '16mm', 'version', 'original', 'Monkees', 'pilot', 'Boyce', 'amp', 'Hart', 'singing', 'songs', 'interview', 'Bobby', 'Hart', 'gallery', 'photos', 'rare', 'memorabilia', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Mike', 'Peter', ""'Monkees"", 'Tour', 'episode', 'original', 'Monkees', 'commercials', 'commercials', 'looked', 'came', 'video', 'dupes', 'pity', 'Rhino', 'could', ""n't"", 'seem', 'find', 'original', 'film', 'sources.Overall', 'excellent', 'presentation', 'first', 'season', 'Monkees', 'beautifully', 'produced', 'packaged', 'Hopefully', 'Season', '2', 'DVD', 'will', 'be', 'just', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'Suggestions', ""'d"", 'make', 'Rhino', 'Second', 'Season', 'box', 'set', 'definitely', 'include', ""'33"", 'amp', '1/3', 'TV', 'special', 'please', 'Rhino', 'marry', 'better', 'video', 'picture', 'VHS', 'box', 'set', 'better', 'sound', 'single', 'tape', 'release', 'special', '1976', ""'Dolenz"", 'Jones', 'Boyce', 'amp', 'Hart', 'special', '1997', 'Hey', 'Monkees', 'TV', 'special', 'Rhino', 'produced', 'Hey', ""'re"", 'Monkees', 'documentary', 'Monkees', 'rare', 'late', '1960', 'TV', 'appearances', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Glen', 'Campbell', 'Hollywood', 'Squares', 'others', 'more', 'rare', 'commercials', 'including', 'Kool', 'Aid', 'commercials', 'were', 'last', 'things', 'Nesmith', 'did', 'Monkees', 'rare', 'outtakes', 'exist', 'show', 'must', 'be', 'included', 'get', 'commentaries', 'episodes', 'four', 'Monkees', 'definitely', 'want', 'hear', 'Micky', 'commentary', ""'The"", 'Frodis', 'Caper', 'episode', 'directed', 'What', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'nice', 'would', 'be', 'include', 'videos', 'Monkees', 'did', '1980', ""'That"", 'Was', 'Then', 'Now', ""'Heart"", 'amp', 'Soul', ""'Every"", 'Step', 'Way', ""'Justus"", 'videos', 'well', 'Rhino', 'should', 'make', 'second', 'box', 'set', 'as', 'complete', 'possible', 'thicker', 'booklet', 'filled', 'rare', 'photos', 'show', 'information', 'make', 'appealing', 'fans', 'second', 'season', 'box', 'set', 'out', 'Christmas', 'definitely', 'want', 'see', 'tree.Kudos', 'Rhino', 'putting', 'together', 'really', 'great', 'DVD', 'set', 'justice', 'first', 'season', 'Monkees', 'TV', 'series']",The Monkees: Season 1

Intellectual leader MIKE, heartthrob DAVY, quiet soul PETER, and zany comic MICKEY channeled not only JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, and RINGO, but also THE THREE STOOGES and THE MARX BROTHERS amid a colorful, fast paced environment of cartoon-like humor, trippy montages, and wacky guest stars from RIP TAYLOR and LON CHANEY JR. to FRANK ZAPPA. The freewheeling showcase was also notable for early music videos of smash hits like LAST TRAIN TO CLARKSVILLE, PLEASANT VALLEY SUNDAY, and DAYDREAM BELIEVER...a clear predecessor for MTV, who paid back the favor 20 years later by running MONKEE-marathons, which made them superstars all over again. MIKE's southern boy charm, MICKEY's irrespressible slap-schtick, DAVY's affecting British accent, and PETER's innocent ""out there"" persona blended as seamlessly as their playful mix of bubblegum, country and rock and roll; for two gloriously fun-filled years, THE MONKEES proved a certified phenomenonon on the groove-tube, on the charts, and in our hearts.RATING: FIVE BARRELS OF LAUGHS",5,BARRELFUL OF MONKEES,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,1250,"['MONKEES-SEASON', '1', 'Often', 'PRE-FAB', 'FOUR', 'intentional', 'similarity', 'certain', 'mop-topped', 'sensation', 'other', 'side', 'pond', 'THE', 'MONKEES', 'was', 'NBC', 'unparallelled', 'hip', 'runaway', 'hit', 'late', 'sixties', 'Intellectual', 'leader', 'MIKE', 'heartthrob', 'DAVY', 'quiet', 'soul', 'PETER', 'zany', 'comic', 'MICKEY', 'channeled', 'not', 'only', 'JOHN', 'PAUL', 'GEORGE', 'RINGO', 'also', 'THE', 'THREE', 'STOOGES', 'THE', 'MARX', 'BROTHERS', 'colorful', 'fast', 'paced', 'environment', 'cartoon-like', 'humor', 'trippy', 'montages', 'wacky', 'guest', 'stars', 'RIP', 'TAYLOR', 'LON', 'CHANEY', 'JR.', 'FRANK', 'ZAPPA', 'freewheeling', 'showcase', 'was', 'also', 'notable', 'early', 'music', 'videos', 'smash', 'hits', 'LAST', 'TRAIN', 'TO', 'CLARKSVILLE', 'PLEASANT', 'VALLEY', 'SUNDAY', 'DAYDREAM', 'BELIEVER', 'clear', 'predecessor', 'MTV', 'who', 'paid', 'back', 'favor', '20', 'years', 'later', 'running', 'MONKEE-marathons', 'made', 'all', 'over', 'again', 'MIKE', 'southern', 'boy', 'charm', 'MICKEY', 'irrespressible', 'slap-schtick', 'DAVY', 'affecting', 'British', 'accent', 'PETER', 'innocent', 'there', 'persona', 'blended', 'as', 'seamlessly', 'playful', 'mix', 'bubblegum', 'country', 'rock', 'roll', 'two', 'gloriously', 'fun-filled', 'years', 'THE', 'MONKEES', 'proved', 'certified', 'phenomenonon', 'groove-tube', 'charts', 'hearts.RATING', 'FIVE', 'BARRELS', 'OF', 'LAUGHS']",The Monkees: Season 1

Downside is that it is a big cute box, 7cm x 15cm x 15cm, and mine got damaged a little in the post and required re-gluing. The actual DVD's are all in their own little cardboard miniature `Record' sleeves, great little facsimiles of the Monkees LP covers, fitted into a removable little `record deck' outer cardboard case that slots into the portable `record player' box. So a lot of the DVD box is air and the odd spring. All the episodes 1 to 32 from the first series are here, first aired from Sept 1996 to April 1967, and they are spread over 6 DVDs. The final DVD also has a few extras, like the Kellogs commercials, discography, play songs only, Monkees commentaries, interview with songwriter Bobby Hart, and a Monkees memorabilia gallery. The set also has little booklet of the chapter indexes and a short `behind the scenes' written piece that's quite interesting (I didn't realise Mickey and Davy were only 20 when picked or that the Monkees concept wasn't nicked from the Beatles film `Hard Days Night' - one of the creators, Bob Rafelson, had toured with a struggling young band in 1962 and got the idea then). See tvtome for the actual episode list. We find the picture/sound fine, particularly on our small bedroom TVs. There is also a similar `record player' DVD set for season two.This first season DVD set is great fun, if a little repetitive naturally being nearly 16h of episodes. My daughter (12) likes the Monkees and has watched most of the episodes - but not as much as her original 4 episode DVD `The Monkees our favourite episodes' - NTSC as well - so perhaps she has suffered from Monkees overload fatigue (and she has since fallen under the spell of the Charmed ones). She also has the CD set `The definitive Monkees - limited edition' which she really likes. She became a fan after singing 'I'm a believer' in the school Choir. She really likes the Monkees humour (and also the similarly zany British series 'The Goodies at last' and '2nd helping' DVD sets - if you can find them in the US). My son (10) also loves this Monkees set, although he tends to watch The Goodies a bit more.

723711,A3GTY9OURO0P3K,B00006ZZ05,liannai,"[10, 10]","Its great to finally see the Monkees on DVD! I loved this show as a child, I watched it in reruns on Nickelodeon and MTV in the 80s. Sure, I was around 5 or 6, but I loved the show, I thought Micky, Peter, Mike and Davy were adorable, and the music was really good. Of course I've caught the show on TV since then, and I remember they had a special in 1996 or 1997 where they attempted to re-do the Monkees (apparently they tried this in the 1980's as &quot;The New Monkees&quot; which didn't last.. and neither did this remake)I think what made the Monkees work, was that there were 4 cute, young guys, each of whom appealed to a vareity of people in their own way. Micky was the zany sort of Jerry Lewis like character with his slapstick. Peter was the &quot;dummy&quot;, Mike was the strong silent type, or the mature one, and Davy was the short, cute &quot;teen idol&quot; of the group. I think I liked every one of the boys at some point. But I think Mike is my favorite. :)Also the entire idea of the show worked (all the silly comedic hijinks) because of the innocence of Micky, Mike, Peter and Davy, and of course the music was solid as well. I think one thing about the Monkees that I love also- are the outfits. This is a time when people actually dressed up on TV, even if their clothes were &quot;funny&quot; for the time. I think they all look handsome all dressed up. I wish people would do that today on TV!Onto the DVD- again its great to see this show in DVD finally, its a classic. As silly and unreal as it is, it works. Now, there are a few things that annoy me about this DVD. You cannot &quot;PLAY ALL EPISODES&quot;(if there is a way someone PLEASE post it!) - you can &quot;Play all Romps&quot; which is great, but this is a show I'd like to watch and then have on in the background, and you can't do that because once an episode ends it returns to the title screen where you have to pick another episode.Another semi-annoying thing is that there isn't commentary on each episode. Only a handful have cometary from Peter, Mike, Davy, James Frawley and Rafelson. Which is fine, but some episodes have multiple tracks, so that 2 people are commenting on the same episode but on different tracks, so you have to watch an entire episode twice to hear each persons comentary.On a high note, I do like the packaging of little 45 records and a record holder. Very unique. Also I know some have complained about the quality of the DVD. I think its fine, I don't really notice a lot of &quot;noise&quot; or &quot;dust&quot; unless I'm watching it on a computer DVD player. Other than that, it doesn't look bad at all on TV. Remember, these films are almost 40 YEARS OLD! So you can't expect it to be perfect, even if coming from the masters. The sound is good, it isn't perfect, but again its almost 40 years old as well, that includes the songs. They are a little noisy, but again if that really bothers you, check out a Monkees CD for the music.I think overall this DVD set is worth owning. The show is still entertaining after all these years, even though its a bit silly with its slapstick humour.

723713,A3HGTTFIDLCWDJ,B00006ZZ05,Medici,"[7, 8]","I'm adding extra kudos to my review after watching several episodes of the Monkees first season. I noticed how good the guest stars are, even the familiar ones who appeared in dozens of shows back then, seem to save their best and sharpest acting for the Monkees show. That's a result of good writing as well as good acting, I believe. Who knew back then at age 11, that not only was it a heart-throb show for pre-teens, but was also a well written adult satire? I can't think of any other children's or teen's show that was also a satisfying adult comedy. Brilliant! And just when it gets a little tiresome, a bit too dated and a bit too silly, it seems to pick up again. So it's still fresh. The four guys are really very good improv actors, that's a greater accomplishment in a way than being good enough to perform in a rock group (which everybody did back then).Initial Review:The Monkees TV show seems as fresh as this morning's dew, it's amazing. I watched the show at age 11, when it first came out, and now, I find it just as good. It seems timeless somehow, and the good writing and editing is partly responsible. But the cast is too, all of them good improv actors, in addition to being musicians. That's something I didn't appreciate way back then. I love the madness of each episode, the guest stars are great, and what silliness they get involved in is heartwarming. They do seem like the Marx Brothers a bit, but they're our Marx Brothers, of our time. I never expected to find this show so good, as a kid I loved them because they were popular and I especially liked Peter Tork. Now, I still like him and Mike Nesmith, these guys were cute.

723716,A3Q83VI243WI7U,B00006ZZ05,Michael Topper,"[5, 8]","This review will mainly be a critique of the actual contents of this package--The Monkees' first season--and not so much a review of the box itself (that will come at the very end).  At the time of its airing, ""The Monkees"" was first regarded as an interesting curiosity (the first time rock music and rock bands were the focus of a sitcom), then as a bunch of ridiculous bubblegum hype with musicians who didn't even play their own instruments (which was not true, of course).  But in retrospect it has been revered as a mostly successful experiment that featured four very talented young men impersonating a band--The Beatles--that was very hard to impersonate, with some great music to match.""The Monkees""--its first season in particular--really does play like a colorized, slightly updated 1966 version of ""A Hard Day's Night"", replete with zany edits, fast-forwards, in-jokes and self-references (they frequently comment directly at the camera), playful social commentary (esp towards the older generation) and pioneering music video bits.  A lot of this was extremely pioneering for television, which makes the show still watchable today, even if some of the humor (esp that taken from the traditional sitcom format of the time) now seems old-fashioned.  What's even better, all four Monkees are verycharismatic; Nesmith's dry, countrified style is my favorite (he's also easily my favorite musician in the band), but all three are fine (even Jones!), and they work brilliantly together, as if having performed for years. The first season got better and better as it progressed, as well, with the scripts eventually dropping a lot of the old-fashioned humor in favor of the ""hip""expressions and humor of the mid-to-late Swinging 60s (which may still look old-fashioned to observers 40 years later, unless they are--like me--big fans of the decade).The Monkees were considered a bubblegum act during their day, but that was largely because of their reputation of having been pre-fabricated by TV producers, and partly due to the Jones-sung ballads.  However, if any other band had come out at the time with their image and songs, they would probably have been well-respected.  The first season wardrobe of paisley and flower-print shirts (as well as the famous six-button, vaguely western uniform), checkered and striped pants, enormous belt buckles and green granny glasses was very 1966, heavily influenced by what was going on in Swinging London and Los Angeles as ""mod"" gradually turned into ""hippie"".  The music, too, was very contemporary, encompassing folk-rock, country-rock (the group, and Nesmith in particular, was very pioneering in this respect), UK Beatle-esque pop (esp from the 65-66 period), ballads, hard garage rock (""She"", ""Words"", ""Mary Mary"", ""Stepping Stone"") and even proto-psychedelia (""Take A Giant Step"", ""This Just Doesn't Seem To Be My Day"").  All the songs were written by excellent writing teams (including Nesmith, who provides some classic tunes in the form of ""Sweet Young Thing"", ""Mary Mary"", ""Papa Gene's Blues"" and ""You Just May Be The One"") and are very slickly produced, which actually put them ahead of many bands of the time.  Although it is true that they do not play the instruments on the studio records during the first season, they soon rectified that situation for ""Headquarters"" and they did play live on tour, which is documented in the season closer that has become celebrated as one of their best episodes.The second season would see the band become full-fledged hippies (actually, the word ""hippie"" makes a hilarious first appearance here in an episode filmed in November of '66 entitled ""I Was A Teenage Monster), with the plots and filming style becoming even more surreal and self-referential and some drug humor subtly laced in--but that's for another review, hopefully soon!  In closing, Rhino did a fair job in releasing the set (the picture quality is the best I've ever seen it, and as good as it's ever going to get), although the price is, as mentioned, very steep; I, too, would rather have ditched the elaborate box packaging in favor of a cut price. The commentaries are sometimes good, sometimes bad, and the 5.1 sound doesn't really work, but these are minor quibbles--the episode trivia is very thorough and the chance to see the original unaired version of the pilot (even with the poor print) is pretty cool.  Anyways, one star knocked off for the price, and because they also could have included alternate versions of the romps shown in syndication that featured different songs from the very great ""Headquarters"" period.",4,Good set at an exorbitant price,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",2003,4597,"['review', 'will', 'mainly', 'be', 'critique', 'actual', 'contents', 'package', 'Monkees', 'first',

But, there is one major aspect of the Monkees TV show that I wish Rhino considered when they compiled this collection:As you may know, many of the songs played during the &quot;Monkee-Romps &quot; were changed when the show was rerun during the summer of 1967, and some were changed again when the show was shown on Saturday mornings.  In many cases, it was these re-worked shows that were included when the show went into syndication in the 1970's.  Since many of us grew up with the syndicated versions, it would have been nice for Rhino to include them on this set.  It gets a bit tedious to have to sit through &quot;Last Train to Clarksville&quot; or &quot;I'm a Believer&quot; for the umpteenth time.  Since DVDs are capable of containing many soundtracks, it would have been fun to have &quot;You Told Me&quot;, &quot;Forget That Girl&quot;, &quot;Shades of Gray&quot;, &quot;For Pete's Sake&quot; and &quot;Steam Engine&quot; available on this collection.  (These songs only appeared in the syndicated episodes while the songs they replaced could be found on other episodes.)  As a result of Rhino not including the alternate soundtracks, the wonderful Headquarters album doesn't get much representation here at all...Apart from this, the set boasts very handsome packaging.  The record player design is just as novel as the TV set design the old VHS box had (but the booklet included in the video box was much better than the small pamphlet included here).  As others have mentioned, the DVDs *do* fall out of the cases rather easily.  To solve this problem, I placed the DVDs into some CD-ROM sleeves that were handy.  This works well and keeps the DVDs from rolling across the floor when you take them out.I also liked the commentaries, although Micky's absence from the proceedings is unfortunate...  I hope he turns up on the second season box, as it would be sad if he didn't provide commentary on the episode he co-wrote &amp; directed!

723725,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,B00006ZZ05,P Magnum,"[4, 9]","The Monkees television program was created to capitalize on the success of The Beatles' movies.  The show was based on the Fab Four's A Hard Day's Night and the idea was to bring rock and roll into primetime for the large teenage audience.  The show cast four unknowns, Mickey Dolenz, Mike Nesmith, Davy Jones & Peter Tork, to play themselves.  The show was produced by Bob Rafelson (who also directed several episodes) and Bert Schneider and they wanted to create a madcap, quick paced show.  The show's plots were pretty simple, usually revolving around Davy falling in love with a girl and the group foiling someone's evil schemes. The way that the show was put together that was extremely inventive.  It didn't follow standard television scene shooting by filming an entire scene on a single set.  The scenes would feature images spliced in and out, quick camera movement from one character to the next, freeze frames, inserting images like light bulbs over someone's head and humorous captions.  The shows also feature what would become known as Monkee romps.  These were set to the Monkees' songs and were basically promotional clips for the songs.  They were the forerunners of music videos and that is probably why MTV featured Monkees episodes in 1986 and helped spur a new Monkeemania wave in the mid 80's.  The Monkees each assumed their own identities, Davy was the handsome one, Mike was the leader, Mickey was the silly one and Peter was the dumb one.  Each actor was quite believable, so believable that the public thought they were an actual group and the success of the music helped pave the way for a Monkees tour.  The show had an anarchic sense of humor and the guys never took themselves too seriously on screen.  It's this loose feel that helps keep the show fresh (although the clothes and phrases are 60's all the way) even today.  The show was a moderate success in the ratings, but it was a big success with the critics.  It won the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series (an award also bestowed on shows like Cheers, All In The Family, Friends and The Mary Tyler Moore Show) for the 1966-67 season and James Frawley won for Outstanding Director for a comedy series as well.  Rhino, as they have done in the past with Monkees material, has done a masterful job in packaging this six-dvd set.  The packaging is like an old record player and the disks are encased in what look like old 45 record sleeves.  Each episode contains a trivia section that can be accessed on the episode screen (the trivia section is quite comprehensive as it gives some background info on the episode, bio information on guest stars, use of music and other interesting tidbits) and can be played in 5.1 surround sound which makes each episode sound crisp and clean.  Each episode is presented in its original format, with all the original songs included (the shows in reruns, both during their original reruns during the show's summer hiatus and when they appeared on Saturday morning contained newer songs used to promote new releases) and even with the Kellogg's and Black Label sponsors shown over the closing credits.  This dvd set a first rate set and a welcomed one as it helps preserve one of the great shows from the 60's and an underrated program that was highly influential (shows like Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In copied the show's style) and highly entertaining.",5,Monkee Business,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",2003,3369,"['Monkees', 'television', 'program', 'was', 'created', 'capitalize', 'success', 'Beatles', 'movies', 'show', 'was', 'based', 'Fab', 'Four', 'A', 'Hard', 'Day', 'Night', 'idea', 'was', 'bring', 'rock', 'roll', 'primetime', 'large', 'teenage', 'audience', 'show', 'cast', 'four', 'unknowns', 'Mickey', 'Dolenz', 'Mike', 'Nesmith', 'Davy', 'Jones', 'Peter', 'Tork', 'play', 'show', 'was', 'produced', 'Bob', 'Rafelson', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'several', 'episodes', 'Bert', 'Schneider', 'wanted', 'create', 'madcap', 'quick', 'paced', 'show', 'show', 'plots', 'were', 'pretty', 'simple', 'usually', 'revolving', 'Davy', 'falling', 'love', 'girl', 'group', 'foiling', 'someone', 'evil', 'schemes', 'way', 'show', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'was', 'extremely', 'inventive', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'standard', 'television', 'scene', 'shooting', 'filming', 'entire', 'scene', 'single', 'set', 'scenes', 'would', 'feature', 'images', 'spliced', 'quick', 'camera', 'movement', 'one', 'character', 'next', 'freeze', 'frames', 'inserting', 'images', 'light', 'bulbs', 'someone', 'head', 'humorous', 'captions', 'shows', 'also', 'feature', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'known', 'Monkee', 'romps', 'were', 'set', 'Monkees', 'songs', 'were', 'basically', 'promotional', 'clips', 'songs', 'were', 'forerunners', 'music', 'videos', 'probably', 'why', 'MTV', 'featured', 'Monkees', 'episodes', '1986', 'helped', 'spur', 'new', 'Monkeemania', 'wave', 'mid', '80', 'Monkees', 'assumed', 'own', 'identities', 'Davy', 'was', 'handsome', 'one', 'Mike', 'was', 'leader', 'Mickey', 'was', 'silly', 'one', 'Peter', 'was', 'dumb', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'quite', 'believable', 'so', 'believable', 'public', 'thought', 'were', 'actual', 'group', 'success', 'music', 'helped', 'pave', 'way', 'Monkees', 'tour', 'show', 'had', 'anarchic', 'sense', 'humor', 'guys', 'never', 'took', 'too', 'seriously', 'screen', 'loose', 'feel', 'keep', 'show', 'fresh', 'clothes', 'phrases', 'are', '60', 'way', 'even', 'today', 'show', 'was', 'moderate', 'success', 'ratings', 'was', 'big', 'success', 'critics', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Outstanding', 'Comedy', 'Series', 'award', 'also', 'bestowed', 'shows', 'Cheers', 'All', 'Family', 'Friends', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', '1966-67', 'season', 'James', 'Frawley', 'won', 'Outstanding', 'Director', 'comedy', 'series', 'well', 'Rhino', 'have', 'done', 'past', 'Monkees', 'material', 'done', 'masterful', 'job', 'packaging', 'six-dvd', 'set', 'packaging', 'old', 'record', 'player', 'disks', 'are', 'encased', 'what', 'look', 'old', '45', 'record', 'sleeves', 'episode', 'trivia', 'section', 'can', 'be', 'accessed', 'episode', 'screen', 'trivia', 'section', 'quite', 'comprehensive', 'background', 'info', 'episode', 'bio', 'information', 'guest', 'stars', 'use', 'music', 'other', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'can', 'be', 'played', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'episode', 'sound', 'crisp', 'clean', 'episode', 'presented', 'original', 'format', 'original', 'songs', 'included', 'shows', 'reruns', 'original', 'reruns', 'show', 'summer', 'hiatus', 'when', 'appeared', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'contained', 'newer', 'songs', 'used', 'promote', 'new', 'releases', 'even', 'Kellogg', 'Black', 'Label', 'sponsors', 'shown', 'closing', 'credits', 'dvd', 'set', 'first', 'rate', 'set', 'welcomed', 'one', 'preserve', 'one', 'great', 'shows', '60', 'underrated', 'program', 'was', 'highly', 'influential', 'shows', 'Rowan', 'Martin', 'Laugh-In', 'copied', 'show', 'style', 'highly', 'entertaining']",The Monkees: Season 1
723726,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00006ZZ05,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 3]","I was far too young to watch ""The Monkees"" in prime time, but discovered them at a young age in syndication on a local independent UHF television station after school at 3:30 in the afternoon. This box set is a great, though imperfect, treat. Realize that the set contains six DVDs and a thin pamphlet, though the packaging is quite large. The quality of the images is generally good, but some episodes are decidedly worse than others, and it would have been nice to see them cleaned up. Likewise, the audio is sometimes uneven. Having said that, the pros far outweigh the cons here: I was thrilled to see the original episodes as they aired in the correct order, and was especially amused by the presence of the Kellogg's advertisements.I had forgotten how many great guest stars the show featured. Stars like Lon Chaney, Rose Marie, Richard Kiel, Mike Farrell, and fellow singing sensation and future deputy sheriff Bobby Sherman predominate. As if that wasn't enough, there's even an episode with both Foster Brooks as a drunken rabbit breeder and comic Doodles Weaver (Sigourney's uncle) as a Broadway producer (""Monkees in Manhattan."") (As a strange aside, if you want a truly otherworldly listening experience, find a copy of Doodles Weaver singing ""Eleanor Rigby."" You won't be disappointed.)The shows all center around the four struggling musicians, and while the show was nominally made to capitalize on the success of the Beatles, realize that the show was originally formulated before the stateside success of Beatles; it took the success of the Fab Four to make studio execs sit up and take note of the potential market. Each episode (except ""Monkees on Tour"") features musical ""romps"" (which are viewable by themselves as a special feature.) While I always liked the music, and while these fast-cut segments define the look of the show, they are fairly repetitive and are now my least part of the episodes. What I remembered loving as a kid, and I appreciate even more now, are the peculiar characters and rather stream-of-consciousness approach in the writing, along with numerous excellent one liners and some sly humor that escaped me as a child (e.g. dominoes as a metaphor for the Vietnam War.)There are too many examples of great gags to cite, but there are some that I particularly like on reflection. Peter is at one point asked ""How do you feel about demonstrations?"" He replies ""They're the only way to sell a vacuum cleaner."" It was a great way to make you think the writers were going to go for a political joke, and then rip the carpet out from under the premise. In the ""Fern and Davy"" episode we are introduced to a variety of terrible performers, among which is Mike as ""Billy Roy Hodstetter"" singing a hilarious version of ""Different Drum,"" which of course Nesmith wrote, and which became a huge hit for Linda Ronstadt. It also introduced a unique nutritional supplement, ""Sdrawkcab"" (which is, of course, ""Backwards"" backwards...other supplements contain iron, but iron can rust, so Sdrawkcab contains aluminum.) These peculiar turns of phrase and in-jokes fly fast and loose throughout the show. Another great example is in ""Monkees at the Circus"" where Mickey keeps singing the theme song to ""Circus Boy"" and is continually quizzed about what he's singing. (Dolenz starred as a child actor in ""Circus Boy."")The ability to lampoon various genres is another hallmark of the series, and I especially liked the superhero duo of ""Frogman and Reuben the Tadpole"" who have a wonderful Batman-style fight. (""Kretch?"") Nesmith was very comfortable improvising and slipping into his Texan persona: the children's story about the ""Wicked Stepladder"" made me laugh out loud, as did his ""Farm Report"" ad libs. One of the best episodes, ""Monkees a la Mode"" features the wonderful characters of Madame Quagmire and Rob Roy Fingerhead who work for ""Chic"" magazine. It's clear from the outset where the conflict will originate from and what the boys will have to do, but their execution of the plan is especially ingenious and well-crafted. The final episode of the season ""The Monkees on Tour"" is especially good and introspective. The live concert footage (from a Phoenix show) is great, though you almost can't hear the songs over the screaming. It is clear that the four had melded into a true performing band at that point, even if they didn't start out that way. The set features commentary by various people on various episodes, including all the Monkees except for Dolenz, as well as people like director James Frawley and songwriter Bobby Hart. Though the commentary tracks are not groundbreaking (a few are downright boring) I enjoyed them, and especially liked the recollections of Jones and Nesmith.Not long ago I had the privilege of meeting and talking with Davy Jones. He was exceptionally friendly and genuine. Davy rekindled my interest in seeing these shows again, after which I only had one thought: what took me so long?",5,A Box Set Of One Of My Fondest Memories Of Childhood,1289952000,"11 17,

The audio and video are excellent for the most part, which make these first season episodes a pleasure to watch.  The picture quality is so good that you will see things in the background that you have never noticed before, even if you've seen the episodes dozens of times.The packaging for this six-disc set is outstanding.  The box looks like a little record player and the discs are inside little cardboard sleeves that replicate actual Monkee 45s.Select episodes have audio commentary from various people connected with the Monkees, except for Micky Dolenz who is sorely missed.  He was hilarious on the audio commentary for the ""Daydream Believers"" DVD and would have had some entertaining things to say about these episodes.  Here's hoping he will be on the second series box set.The booklet that comes with the set is a bit lacking but the discs make up for this by including trivia on each episode from a well-known Monkee website.  However, some trivia that has previously not been seen before would have been nice.When I reviewed Rhino's Monkees Volume One & Two on Amazon, I mentioned several things that I thought would make good extras when the entire Monkees series came out on DVD.  Rhino has lived up to most of my expectations, including putting the alternate version of the pilot in the set and most of the Monkees TV commercials.  That being said, most of the commercials are of poor quality and look like they were taken off of a bootleg tape called ""Secret Video Files"" that is in wide circulation among Monkee fans.  I still appreciate them being included though.  I was also a bit disappointed that the episodes did not feature the alternate music soundtracks from reruns and syndication.Despite these minor flaws, here's hoping the same creative people work on the release and packaging of the Monkees Season Two DVD set.",4,What Monkee Fans Have Been Waiting For,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",2003,1912,"['box', 'set', 'Rhino', 'been', 'wait', 'Monkees', 'fans', 'audio', 'video', 'are', 'excellent', 'most', 'part', 'make', 'first', 'season', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'picture', 'quality', 'so', 'good', 'will', 'see', 'things', 'background', 'have', 'never', 'noticed', 'even', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'dozens', 'times.The', 'packaging', 'six-disc', 'set', 'outstanding', 'box', 'little', 'record', 'player', 'discs', 'are', 'inside', 'little', 'cardboard', 'replicate', 'actual', 'Monkee', '45s.Select', 'episodes', 'have', 'audio', 'commentary', 'various', 'people', 'connected', 'Monkees', 'Micky', 'Dolenz', 'who', 'sorely', 'missed', 'was', 'hilarious', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Daydream', 'Believers', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'entertaining', 'things', 'say', 'episodes', 'Here', 'hoping', 'will', 'be', 'second', 'series', 'box', 'set.The', 'booklet', 'set', 'bit', 'lacking', 'discs', 'make', 'up', 'including', 'trivia', 'episode', 'well-known', 'Monkee', 'website', 'However', 'trivia', 'previously', 'not', 'been', 'seen', 'before', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice.When', 'reviewed', 'Rhino', 'Monkees', 'Volume', 'One', 'Two', 'Amazon', 'mentioned', 'several', 'things', 'thought', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'extras', 'when', 'entire', 'Monkees', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'Rhino', 'lived', 'up', 'most', 'expectations', 'including', 'putting', 'alternate', 'version', 'pilot', 'set', 'most', 'Monkees', 'TV', 'commercials', 'being', 'said', 'most', 'commercials', 'are', 'poor', 'quality', 'look', 'were', 'taken', 'off', 'bootleg', 'tape', 'called', 'Secret', 'Video', 'Files', 'wide', 'circulation', 'Monkee', 'fans', 'still', 'appreciate', 'being', 'included', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'episodes', 'did', 'not', 'feature', 'alternate', 'music', 'soundtracks', 'reruns', 'syndication.Despite', 'minor', 'flaws', 'here', 'hoping', 'same', 'creative', 'people', 'work', 'release', 'packaging', 'Monkees', 'Season', 'Two', 'DVD', 'set']",The Monkees: Season 1

So, our family was stuck watching shows on CBS until then, since we couldn't pick-up other networks 'til the antenna was installed. As a result, I had to watch the ""Monkees"" on Saturday mornings, when they were in re-runs on CBS, starting in 1968.The ""Monkees"" was a cutting-edge sitcom for its time. The 60s were a new era in pop-culture, television included. So, the ""Monkees"" fit right in to the new generational zeitgeist, that took over America during the mid-60s.The show was meant to be a spoof of a rock-band, who lived together in a cool beach house. The ""Monkees"" were 4 young, good-looking dudes on-the-loose. They never had to answer to any authority figures, such as parents, teachers, etc. That factor alone, made them popular with their youthful viewer-ship. And this was a show aimed right at the under-22 demographic, during the swinging 60s.The ""Monkees"" consisted of Mike Nesmith on guitar, Peter Tork on bass, Mickey Dolenz as their drummer, and Davey Jones as their lead-singer (a role he shared with Mickey Donlenz). It was always fun to watch their zany, Marx-brothers-like brand of slap-stick antics. They had a wonderful, on-screen chemistry going on between them all. Instead of relying on funny dialog, the ""Monkees"" series ran on the strength of the group's highly energetic performances. Each episode revolved around the group getting into hilarious misadventures, but coming-out unscathed in the end.The group also performed their hit songs in every episode. Most of the ""Monkees"" songs were written by some very talented composers, including Neil Diamond, and Boyce & Hart. And so, the Monkees had many chart-topping hits during the 60s.Some have said that the ""Monkees"" were an insignificant part of the 60s music scene. I disagree. Their show was the early template that paved the way for later sitcoms about rock music, such as the Partridge Family. Most importantly, the ""Monkees"" series was pioneering, since it linked the concept of visual performances set to pop music. Without this show, there probably never would've been MTV.As for me, I really looked forward to my sugar-laden bowl of cereal, while watching the ""Monkees"" every Saturday morning as a youngster.

Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[61, 64]","The 2003 Rhino release repackaged at half the price - and easier to store.It seems that I've been prefacing my Amazon reviews a lot lately by stating that Amazon has a dumb policy of grouping reviews of ALL releases of any video. If I film was released on VHS and later on DVD and then on Blu-ray, ALL the reviews appear on all products. So readers should always click on ""Newest First"" and look at date review is posted.This is the case of this Complete Monkees Season One. The set was released on DVD yesterday by Eagle Rock Entertainment, and yet there are 63 reviews of it going back to 2003, when Rhino first released the six-disc set - in a package that looked like a record play and had a list price of about $89.95. The new set from Eagle Rock comes in a much more conservative foldout digipak and lists for $39.95. After watching much of this new set - and reading details of the prior Rhino release, it most definitely appears that this is just a re-packaging of the earlier set at a price reduction of about 50% - an a package that will be easier to store. All the bonus features are the ones listed for the earlier set. So, if you already own the earlier volume, there is no need to purchase this one. BUT...... if you didn't buy it because of the price, now's your chance.I was never a huge fan of the show but did watch it occasionally, hoping that there would be lots of musical performances. But there weren't as I learned then and remembered as I watched these DVDs. Most of the music came during the ""romps"" (scenes where Monkee's hits would play in the background. There is an option to just watch the romps on this set (same as earlier one) and they rarely ran much over a minute each.There is lots of bonus material here with multiple commentaries from the cast or directors. And there are the vintage Kellogg's commercials. But the prints have not been newly remastered and the color quality does vary.I was attracted to the set to see how much I remembered and to re-watch an episode I remembered well (well, pretty well) with guest star - satirist Stan Freberg. It was nice to see again. And I've spent hours with this set already, hitting the fast forward button only occasionally when things got a bit too ""silly""I won't rehash comments from many of the reviews from 2003 because they pretty much remain the same. The Monkees were TV icons of the 1960s and have a very strong fan base. That base will want to own this set - again, if they don't have it already.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,The 2003 Rhino release repackaged at half the price - and easier to store.,1317081600,"09 27, 2011",2011,2520,"['2003', 'Rhino', 'release', 'repackaged', 'price', 'easier', 'store.It', ""'ve"", 'been', 'prefacing', 'Amazon', 'lot', 'lately', 'stating', 'Amazon', 'dumb', 'policy', 'grouping', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'releases', 'video', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'VHS', 'later', 'DVD', 'then', 'Blu-ray', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'appear', 'products', 'readers', 'should', 'always', 'click', 'Newest', 'First', 'look', 'date', 'review', 'posted.This', 'case', 'Complete', 'Monkees', 'Season', 'One', 'set', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'yesterday', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'Entertainment', 'yet', 'are', '63', 'reviews', 'going', 'back', '2003', 'when', 'Rhino', 'first', 'released', 'six-disc', 'set', 'package', 'looked', 'record', 'play', 'had', 'list', 'price', '89.95', 'new', 'set', 'Eagle', 'Rock', 'much', 'more', 'conservative', 'foldout', 'digipak', 'lists', '39.95', 'watching', 'much', 'new', 'set', 'reading', 'details', 'prior', 'Rhino', 'release', 'most', 'definitely', 'just', 're-packaging', 'earlier', 'set', 'price', 'reduction', 'about', '50', '%', 'package', 'will', 'be', 'easier', 'store', 'bonus', 'features', 'are', 'ones', 'listed', 'earlier', 'set', 'So', 'already', 'own', 'earlier', 'volume', 'need', 'purchase', 'one', 'BUT', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'price', 'now', 'chance.I', 'was', 'never', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'did', 'watch', 'occasionally', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'lots', 'musical', 'performances', 'were', ""n't"", 'learned', 'then', 'remembered', 'watched', 'DVDs', 'Most', 'music', 'came', 'romps', 'scenes', 'where', 'Monkee', 'hits', 'would', 'play', 'background', 'option', 'just', 'watch', 'romps', 'set', 'same', 'earlier', 'one', 'rarely', 'ran', 'much', 'minute', 'lots', 'bonus', 'material', 'here', 'multiple', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'directors', 'are', 'vintage', 'Kellogg', 'commercials', 'prints', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'newly', 'remastered', 'color', 'quality', 'vary.I', 'was', 'attracted', 'set', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'remembered', 're-watch', 'episode', 'remembered', 'well', 'well', 'pretty', 'well', 'guest', 'star', 'satirist', 'Stan', 'Freberg', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'again', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'hours', 'set', 'already', 'hitting', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'only', 'occasionally', 'when', 'things', 'got', 'bit', 'too', 'silly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'rehash', 'comments', 'many', 'reviews', '2003', 'pretty', 'much', 'remain', 'same', 'Monkees', 'were', 'TV', 'icons', '1960s', 'have', 'very', 'strong', 'fan', 'base', 'base', 'will', 'want', 'own', 'set', 'again', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'already.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",The Monkees: Season 1

I've always written off the first season of THE MONKEES as overly shrill, cutesy, and childish, the worst aspect being the standard laugh track, which tends to flatten some episodes outright.  But, while the second season (and the feature film HEAD) are light years ahead of season one in terms of music, performance, and overall style, watching this set has allowed me an opportunity to re-appraise the earlier shows.  While some are still pretty unpleasant, even the worst episodes have moments of surprising, almost experimental, quality.  The pacing and editing of these shows alone stand out as being well ahead of their time, and, even from the very beginning, the show borders on Brechtian in all the many ways (albeit mostly minor) it attempted to break the fourth wall of televisual artifice.  I am convinced that anyone who wrote the show off as kid's stuff or criticized the Monkees themselves as being talentless or disposable Beatle rip-offs has simply been misguided.

I was very pleased to see Nez comment on a couple of episodes since he is so often absent from modern Monkee projects.  Both Nez and Peter give some nice insight to the Monkees on Tour episode.  It would have been great to hear all four comment on the craziness of touring, but that is a minor gripe.Listening to Peter's commentary my wife noted that &quot;Peter doesn't really like Mike does he?&quot;.  Like his commentary from Daydream Believers, Peter is often out front with his assessment of Nez.David also has some nice commentary and he seems to really enjoy watching and remembering the show.  Actually they all seem to enjoy it and you can feel the pride in the work they did.Sadly Dolenz isn't involved in any commentary.  Apparently he was unavailable which is too bad because his commentary on the VH1 Daydream Believers was a riot.  He really needs to comment on Frodis in season two, even if Rhino has to hold the set up to get him.The photo gallery, which I expect many will skip over contains some very cool scans, including &quot;grading&quot; sheets of many that tried out for the show.  Some interesting tidbits come out of this including the fact that not only did a number of females try out, but at least one was seriously considered and apparently turned it down because she didn't want to commit to a series.As for season two, like many I hope Rhino includes 33 1/3 in addition to the 80's and 90's music videos.  I guess while we are dreaming, one of the concerts (Billboard Live) with all four guys would be perfect.  Then there is the ABC reunion special. Yeah, I know I can only dream.  I imagine if we don't get these items tagged onto the season two box we never will.  Now is a good time to write Rhino and ask (or beg).As for the actual packaging.  As many have mentioned it is modeled after a 1960's phonograph and looks very cool.  The problem is it won't match any other boxed DVD set you have, nor will it fit well on your DVD shelf.  &quot;No big deal&quot; I say, let's just stick it with The Monkees CD's.  Not so fast, it's too big for that shelf.  So I give Rhino 5 stars for creativity and take back half a star for the impractical nature of the box.

LeBaron ""Todd LeBaron""","[12, 15]","Rhino has always done a stellar job with just about everything they've gotten their hands on, and the two seasons of The Monkees are no exception. I agree with the one reviewer who asked why the ""updated"" soundtracks couldn't have been included (as in, summer repeats with newer songs, for those of us who also remember ""Midnight Train"" in the ""Chaperone"" episode and so on)...other than that MINOR complaint...the shows are there, in order, and they look about as good as can be expected...nice work, Rhino...and GREAT touch adding ""33 1/3rd Revolutions"" to season two as well as the Kellogg's and Yardley ads...excellent touches!

723739,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00006ZZ05,trebe,"[2, 5]","The Monkees TV program ran for two seasons, combining comedy and music, to present a unique view of the 60's pop culture, focusing on the adventures of an aspiring Southern California band.  Wacky, unconventional, spontaneous, outrageous, irreverent, and fun, are just a few of the adjectives that could be used to describe the world of the Monkees.  Then as now, the reasons for this program's appeal, lies with their music, and the intrinsic charm, and talent of the members of the group.  Modeled on the Beatles' film, A Hard Days Night, the Monkees won an Emmy for best comedy program, in its first season.Circumstances brought together relative unknowns, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork, Davy Jones, and Mike Nesmith, to play roles as members of a rock group.  Who could predict the phenomenon that this fortuitous casting would come to produce?  Transcending their TV roles to become a ""real"" band, writing and playing their own music, achieving worldwide success, and turning fiction into fact.Much has been said about the Monkees' music, which originally consisted of their vocals being recorded over music played by studio musicians.  As the original concept was for a fictitious rock group, this approach to music making was a most natural one.  Top songwriters were recruited to pen material for the group.  ""Manufactured"" or not, their fans didn't care, and the results are hard to argue with, as the Monkees had a string of hits produced in just this matter.  A fact that irks critics immensely.  Season one's final episode, which shows the events taking placing before an actual Monkee concert, provides real insight into their lives, and has three separate commentary tracks as well.The DVD set is not inexpensive, and served up in one 32 episode dose, is a bit too much for the casual fan.  This is one set that is definitely for the true fan, with material running over 13 hours.  The transfers are very good, with just a few signs of deterioration.  Commentary tracks by Peter, Davy, Mike, director Bob Rafelson, and songwriter Bobby Hart, provide different insights into selected episodes.  Unfortunately, there is no commentary from the ""voice of the Monkees"", Mickey Dolenz.The extras are only semi satisfying, and could have been much better and more comprehensive.  A retrospective documentary, where we could hear from the guys, and see them as they look today, would have been great.  The closest we get, is Bobby Hart's recollection of events.  For those interested in reading rather obscure, often inane trivia, such is provided for each episode.  Some discs as an extra, feature a compilation of the musical ""romps"" from the episodes on the disc.  Better than nothing, but just barely.Many have commented on the ""creative"" packaging of the set, in which the six discs are inserted into album sleeves, and placed into a cardboard box resembling a portable phonograph.  It's all very cute, but not the most practical design for long term storage.  Expect something similar for Season 2.The Monkees remind us of a time, when life seemed much simpler, with an idealistic perspective that never gets too heavy or into the dark side of life.  While the number of episodes may overwhelm some, true fans rejoice and eagerly await Season 2.
