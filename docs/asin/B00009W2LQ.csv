Out of all the end time films out there, this one is the best.  It does not rely on spiffy special effects, nor is it bent on overly violent exploration as to what the Antichrist will do toward those being brought to Christ after the Rapture, it does however make you examine and make you see the follies of your life, of believing the world's system, and what happens if you miss out and continue to miss out on God's grace and holiness (note, the two, it isn't just about grace, it is also about God's holiness).  The film begins with the end, that is, with the Rapture coming.  Two FBI agents, think of the X-Files and you get the jist, begin investigating the vanishings.  The main character is hit again and again with what it means to have had faith in God through Christ and what it means to think of yourself as a ""good person"" and not pay attention to what it means to be saved.  The main character must face his own follies and his own pride and his own arrogance, he must face what it means to serve the world or to serve the Lord, when coming into contact with one of the 144,000 Messianic Jews who will come into full force after the Rapture and starting during the first half of the seven years of Tribulation as outlined in the book of Daniel and in the book of Revelation.  I say to any and all who want a good decent Christian movie to buy this and to support this movie.  It will teach you a lot without grinding you down with heavy theology, just enough to bring you to (after the end) go and get your Bible and really examine your life with the Lord.",5,"The best of the ""End Times"" movies",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",2005,1836,"['Left', 'Behind', 'being', 'shown', 'read', 'studied', 'explored', 'etc', 'etc.', 'well', 'good', 'myself', 'agree', 'doctrine', 'am', 'glad', 'see', 'people', 'being', 'brought', 'Christ', 'Jesus', 'little', 'film', 'went', 'more', 'less', 'unnoticed', 'shame', 'end', 'time', 'films', 'there', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'rely', 'spiffy', 'special', 'effects', 'bent', 'overly', 'violent', 'exploration', 'what', 'Antichrist', 'will', 'do', 'being', 'brought', 'Christ', 'Rapture', 'however', 'make', 'examine', 'make', 'see', 'follies', 'life', 'believing', 'world', 'system', 'what', 'miss', 'out', 'continue', 'miss', 'out', 'God', 'grace', 'holiness', 'note', 'two', ""n't"", 'just', 'about', 'grace', 'also', 'God', 'holiness', 'film', 'end', 'Rapture', 'coming', 'Two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'think', 'X-Files', 'get', 'jist', 'begin', 'investigating', 'vanishings', 'main', 'character', 'hit', 'again', 'again', 'what', 'have', 'had', 'faith', 'God', 'Christ', 'what', 'think', 'good', 'person', 'not', 'pay', 'attention', 'what', 'be', 'saved', 'main', 'character', 'must', 'face', 'own', 'follies', 'own', 'pride', 'own', 'arrogance', 'must', 'face', 'what', 'serve', 'world', 'serve', 'Lord', 'when', 'coming', 'contact', 'one', '144,000', 'Messianic', 'Jews', 'who', 'will', 'come', 'full', 'force', 'Rapture', 'starting', 'first', 'half', 'seven', 'years', 'Tribulation', 'outlined', 'book', 'Daniel', 'book', 'Revelation', 'say', 'who', 'want', 'good', 'decent', 'Christian', 'movie', 'buy', 'support', 'movie', 'will', 'teach', 'lot', 'grinding', 'down', 'heavy', 'theology', 'just', 'enough', 'bring', 'end', 'go', 'get', 'Bible', 'really', 'examine', 'life', 'Lord']",N/A

No earthquakes, asteroids, megadisaster action stuff here.  This movie is largely character-driven, exploring varied individual responses, both to the rapture and to the gospel.  It is faithful to scripture, avoiding speculation.  For example, when one of the FBI agents asks Jewish believer Jacob Krause if he is one of the 144,000, the movie could have said ""yes,"" but did not, choosing to have Jacob respond that he is a servant of God--in other words, grey areas are left grey but still addressed.  Evangelistic message without being preachy or pedantic, subtly laced with metaphors, well-produced, compelling, believable characters of varying backgrounds, and a suspenseful, well-developed story that's entertaining as well as personally encouraging:  Two FBI agents are tasked with interviewing acquaintances of those who've disappeared, and as they proceed in the questioning, they find themselves doing some self-questioning, particularly after their new assignment to pursue an alleged national security threat, a Jacob Krause, whom databases identify as a rabbi who's accumulated some followers holed up in a Christian mission.",5,A Different Kind of Rapture Movie,1149206400,"06 2, 2006",2006,1300,"['name', 'implies', ""'The"", 'Moment', 'not', 'various', 'Revelation/tribulation', 'judgments', 'place', 'first', 'few', 'months', 'rapture', 'earthquakes', 'asteroids', 'megadisaster', 'action', 'stuff', 'here', 'movie', 'largely', 'character-driven', 'exploring', 'varied', 'individual', 'responses', 'rapture', 'gospel', 'faithful', 'scripture', 'avoiding', 'speculation', 'example', 'when', 'one', 'FBI', 'agents', 'Jewish', 'believer', 'Jacob', 'Krause', 'one', '144,000', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'said', 'yes', 'did', 'not', 'choosing', 'have', 'Jacob', 'respond', 'servant', 'God', 'other', 'words', 'grey', 'areas', 'are', 'left', 'grey', 'still', 'addressed', 'Evangelistic', 'message', 'being', 'preachy', 'pedantic', 'subtly', 'laced', 'metaphors', 'well-produced', 'compelling', 'believable', 'characters', 'varying', 'backgrounds', 'suspenseful', 'well-developed', 'story', 'entertaining', 'as', 'well', 'personally', 'encouraging', 'Two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'are', 'tasked', 'interviewing', 'acquaintances', 'who', ""'ve"", 'disappeared', 'proceed', 'questioning', 'find', 'doing', 'self-questioning', 'particularly', 'new', 'assignment', 'pursue', 'alleged', 'national', 'security', 'threat', 'Jacob', 'Krause', 'whom', 'identify', 'rabbi', 'who', 'accumulated', 'followers', 'holed', 'up', 'Christian', 'mission']",N/A
758735,A2XBBQ36STNJ0G,B00009W2LQ,here_is_your_review,"[30, 32]","Though the timing of the Rapture is an oft-debated topic, this is one of the best films you'll find from the pre-tribulational viewpoint.This film reunites David White, Kevin Downes and Brad Heller from &quot;End of the Harvest&quot;. If you liked the &quot;Left Behind&quot; books and movies, you'll love this film, I guarantee it. Wes Lewellyn did a terrific job finding scenic locations in California for this movie.Early one morning, the Rapture takes place and two FBI agents are assigned to work a list of 600+ missing persons, including one of their long-time friends. With each interview, they grow more puzzled at the bizarre event that has just taken place. Curiously, many seem to want to dismiss it without explanation.Brad Heller is simply excellent as the Messianic Jew who comes to know Christ as the Incarnate Son of God. Blowing a shofar to signify his new found Faith, Heller as &quot;Jacob Krause&quot; begins to evangelize the streets.There's a slight continuity error when Kevin Downe's character walks into a wood shop with dark brown pants. In the next scene, outside, he's wearing tan pants. In the director's and the actor's commentary, both included on the DVD version, they have a little laugh about Kevin's &quot;magic pants&quot; in this scene.Regardless of one's viewpoint on the Rapture, given Matthew 24:42 and Matthew 24:44, this film at least makes one think. This film was released in 1999, about a year before &quot;Left Behind: The Movie&quot; made its way to stores.The DVD version also includes a theatrical trailer, language selections of English, French, Spanish and Portuguese, the aforementioned actor's commentary, director's commentary and one deleted scene. They note that somebody stole their DAT (Digital Audio Tape) and three days of sound for filming was lost (two of those days were dubbed in).I recommend it, especially on DVD if you can get it.",5,Wonderful Movie on the Pre-Tribulation Rapture!!!,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",2004,1897,"['timing', 'Rapture', 'oft-debated', 'topic', 'one', 'best', 'films', ""'ll"", 'find', 'pre-tribulational', 'viewpoint.This', 'film', 'David', 'White', 'Kevin', 'Downes', 'Brad', 'Heller', 'quot', 'End', 'Harvest', 'quot', 'liked', 'quot', 'Left', 'Behind', 'quot', 'books', 'movies', ""'ll"", 'love', 'film', 'guarantee', 'Wes', 'Lewellyn', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'finding', 'scenic', 'locations', 'California', 'movie.Early', 'one', 'morning', 'Rapture', 'place', 'two', 'FBI', 'agents', 'are', 'assigned', 'work', 'list', '600+', 'missing', 'persons', 'including', 'one', 'long-time', 'friends', 'interview', 'grow', 'more', 'puzzled', 'bizarre', 'event', 'just', 'taken', 'place', 'Curiously', 'many', 'seem', 'want', 'dismiss', 'explanation.Brad', 'Heller', 'simply', 'excellent', 'Messianic', 'Jew', 'who', 'know', 'Christ', 'Incarnate', 'Son', 'God', 'Blowing', 'shofar', 'signify', 'new', 'found', 'Faith', 'Heller', 'quot', 'Jacob', 'Krause', 'quot', 'evangelize', 'streets.There', 'slight', 'continuity', 'error', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Downe', 'character', 'wood', 'shop', 'dark', 'brown', 'pants', 'next', 'scene', 'outside', 'wearing', 'tan', 'pants', 'director', 'actor', 'commentary', 'included', 'DVD', 'version', 'have', 'little', 'laugh', 'Kevin', 'quot', 'magic', 'pants', 'quot', 'scene.Regardless', 'one', 'viewpoint', 'Rapture', 'given', 'Matthew', '24:42', 'Matthew', '24:44', 'film', 'least', 'one', 'think', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1999', 'year', 'quot', 'Left', 'Movie', 'quot', 'made', 'way', 'stores.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'also', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'language', 'selections', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish', 'Portuguese', 'aforementioned', 'actor', 'commentary', 'director', 'commentary', 'one', 'deleted', 'scene', 'note', 'somebody', 'stole', 'DAT', 'Digital', 'Audio', 'Tape', 'three', 'days', 'sound', 'filming', 'was', 'lost', 'two', 'days', 'were', 'dubbed', '.I', 'recommend', 'especially', 'DVD', 'can', 'get']",N/A

Because someone who's never seen a rapture movie before might actually enjoy this.In closing, here's the final reason the movie seemed ho-hum to me:Because all the supposedly scary technology portrayed in the movie was very TODAY (rather than being a remote, futuristic possibility).

Friends of Christians sometimes convert, while many that had enjoyed the Christian culture, but never truly accepted the faith, fall away.  The societal transformation from democracy, to martial law, to global totalitarianism is portrayed as a progression that will happen most natural.  Also, the ""why did this happen?"" question gets answered in typical government fashion:  We're investigating, we're looking into it, we're researching all possiblities, and finally, once people tire of the search...there is no answer--but it's time to move on.  It all happens quite believably.Concerning acting and effects--the movie crosses the threshold from being ""amatuer but with a strong message"" to being a competent film...but just barely.  The acting, action, scenery etc. are all acceptable, but not stellar.  If the viewer is predisposed to believe the message, then it's all worthwhile.  However, if one has little interest in spiritual matters or an evangelical Christian understanding of the End Times, then the film will seem slow, and at times ""preachy.""Bottom-line:  This is a top-notch church film, and a decent movie.  However, it is not stellar.  The slow pacing of the story is its greatest deficiency.  It is worth seeing, however there are better productions out.
