Screenwriter Eric Roth is known as the screenwriter for some very memorable, sentimental fare (Forrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition),The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (The Criterion Collection)) as well as, in my honest opinion, the best contemporary spy films (Munich (Widescreen Edition),The Good Shepherd (Widescreen Edition)), and here he took a oft-times choppy book and masterfully adapted it into a story that is easier to follow and more audience-friendly, but without compromising the overall message and integrity of the story.

1527196,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0077ATSSQ,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 6]","I'll start by saying this; I am a huge fan of Jonathan Safran Foer's novel.  In fact, it is probably up there with `The Road', `Lord of the Flies', `American Psycho' and `The Remains of the Day' as one of my five favorite novels ever written (that I've read, obviously).  When this film was green lit and Hollywood was buzzing over it, I was ecstatic.  While I can't say that I worship Daldry, I do think that `Billy Elliot' is a masterpiece and I really, truly loved `The Reader'.  `The Hours', in my eyes, was a bore and a mess and a missed opportunity, but I see some of its merit.  I was underwhelmed by the casting decisions, mainly because Bullock and Hanks aren't my ideal actors (far too commercial for a film like this) and Horn was a complete nobody (I mean, he's from Jeopardy Jr. for god's sake) but the supporting cast which included Sydow, Davis, Goodman, Caldwell, Wright and Gandolfini (I can't believe they cut all of his scenes!) had me excited, and this prose is just so good.Some books are just not meant to be adapted.This makes me want to cry, but it's true.  I had this epiphany while watching `Everything is Illuminated', also adapted from a Safran Foer novel, and it happened again while watching `Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close'.  Safran Foer's writing is too absurd and intricate to be captured on the big screen.  A lot of his character development, while interesting and engaging on the printed page, comes off as painfully unrealistic on the big screen.  I told my wife, about halfway through the film, that Oskar is almost identical to the way he is depicted in the novel and yet I never had the urge to push him off a bridge while I was reading the book.Daldry's take on Foer's novel just doesn't work.  Foer's novel is too complicated and too detailed, and Daldry misses a lot of that detail.  I understand that the prose had to be focused more, considering that they couldn't make a five hour movie just to fit in everything Foer put in his book, but then again if you aren't going to incorporate all the facets of the book that make it so special, maybe you just shouldn't make the movie.  By skipping some of the books important character development (that whole backstory with Oskar's grandmother and the renter is especially important to the impact of the story) the film falls flat in areas where it should have really soared.I'll break up the negative by saying that Max Von Sydow was extraordinary and deserved that Oscar nomination; maybe even the Oscar just for that `STOP.  NO MORE!' scene alone.But alas, back to the pit of despair.  I was especially upset with the film's editing choices.  The construction of a novel and a film differ, and a novel can get away with excessive use of flashbacks because they can be clearly defined and incorporated in ways that don't take away from the particular sequence being depicted at that moment.  In film, flashbacks can be tricky, and if they aren't defined properly they can take away drastically from the film itself.  There are a LOT of flashbacks here, and while backstory is necessary to the development of this particular story, the way that they are administered (especially with the incorporated of that horrid narration) kept me getting increasingly more and more frustrated.  They took you out of the moment and put you somewhere else only to take you out of that moment and cause you to scramble to put yourself back where you were before the flashback started.  That narration didn't help much either.  I don't really like narration, unless it is essential.  `Little Children' probably has the best use of narration I've seen in a long time, but it is a rarity to find a film that uses it appropriately.  The fact that Oscar feels the need to tell us EVERYTHING is not appropriate.  The audience isn't stupid, but the narration makes us feel that way.  Then again, Thomas Horn's delivery is atrocious and adds to the annoyance of the narration.I hate picking on the kid, but it is easily the worst child performance I've seen since that last Sandra Bullock movie.  It's just so painful to watch because he tries so hard to be awkward that he comes off, well, awkward, but not in a good way.  The character of Oskar Schell is an odd one, sure, and so maybe it's just that he doesn't translate well, but I found Horn's manner of speaking to be so incredibly obnoxious I wanted to punch my television screen.  In the book, Oskar thought about weird things and he was unusually smart and curious and he had this maturity that was laced with so much immaturity that he was a compelling character, but I didn't read effeminate, and that is how Horn plays him, which is just odd and off-putting.  Also, the way he talks as if he's reading a book, so rehearsed, is just strange.I'll end this with some positive ink.  The score is AMAZING and the film is gorgeously lensed.  Sadly, technical aspects don't make for a great movie, and this film fails at nearly everything else.",2,Extremely disappointed...,1339632000,"06 14, 2012",2012,4972,"[""'ll"", 'start', 'saying',

What may seem like an appealing adventure involving a young boy walking around New York City searching for clues with a key, turns into a horrendous mess that goes absolutely nowhere.The problem is without a doubt the character of Thomas Horn.  His acting is overblown, exaggerated and incredibly stiff.  It's not the least bit realistic that a young kid would act the way he does, and he's obviously trying WAY too hard to deliver his lines (hence the stiff part).  This means you don't feel any compassion for his character, or care about him or his ""adventure"" in any way, shape or form.  It's reminiscent and perhaps influenced by Haley Joel Osment from the Sixth Sense, which is precisely the reason *that* movie failed so miserably.  The difference is that Haley's overconfident character destroyed the horror in the Sixth Sense, and Thomas' character destroys the sense of adventure here.To add more to the frustration is that there's nothing but one confusing segment after another.  Why did Thomas visit the African American woman and treat her so politely by insisting on snapping a photo of her beautiful face?  Why was he hiding under his bed a short time later?  I can't even say that the overconfidence of Thomas Horns' character is solely the reason this movie is so horrible.  The storyline being confusing is probably equally to blame.  What a waste of time.  His only spectacular moment comes when he argues with his mother (played by Sandra Bullock).When the boy explains that his father was killed in the 9/11 incident and delivers a bunch of fast-paced frantically delivered lines, math equations and other clues, this is when I finally said ""Alright, I'm done with this"" and shut it off.  This was about halfway through.  The TV show Touch that recently came out last year was probably influenced by this, but Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is way worse than the show thanks to Thomas Horn trying way too hard to be believable and mature but losing all sense of adventure, compassion and interest in the process.  Proof that you may have what it takes to be a quality actor, but end up terribly boring anyway.  As for Tom Hanks, what's it been, 15 years since his last good movie?

The boy is afraid of all kinds of things, but nothing so much as people.Upon his father's passing, the boy ignores his mother and pursues a fantasy-esque grand quest to find the lock which his father's mysterious key will open. His purpose is simple:  he wants to continue to hold onto his father's memory. Not just a remembrance, but a true memory, like he is there. The boy must face every fear he has to even begin his mission, but for his father, he'll do anything.The boy's journey is where the movie shines. His hardships, his ability to overcome himself, his enduring love for his father and his interactions with the dozens of hurting people throughout New York City are captivating and heart-chord strumming.If you enjoy emotional stories that deal this love, death and growth, then you will surely like this film as well.

1527211,A2NI9BFPKAFAZ0,B0077ATSSQ,Blago Jones,"[0, 0]","Pros: I don't know if I've mentioned this to you, but I'm kind of a big Tom Hanks fan. In the world of cinema, I'm pretty confident that a better actor cannot be found currently or in the past. And for another one of his caliber to come along in the future would simply be super awesome. Almost like the Second Coming of Christ, but without any of the sacrilege a comparison like that might normally imply. Accordingly, I spent much of the movie hoping for Mr. Hanks to pop back up on the screen, so that I could cry some more about the fact that he was dead (that's a spoiler only if you know absolutely nothing about the movie, by the way). This wasn't necessarily Hanks' best work, but I'm not going to complain about any opportunity to see him strut his stuff on the silver screen. Especially when he's providing me with an excellent parental role model, whereby his primary function in life appeared to be blatantly lying to his son in a playful sort of ""I'm going to fill my kid's head with so many stupid little factual inaccuracies that he's going to have a complex when he's older"" way.Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. It's really important to me to be able to watch a movie and understand what it is that the characters are saying to me. That is, if there's talking at all. Some movies this year just sidestepped that problem completely. So anyway, it was nice that, quite unbelievably, a small child was able to deliver each of his lines in a manner that I could both hear and understand. In the emotionally raw reality of this movie, you have a little boy able to deliver lines in a very straight laced, non-speech-impeded, discernible manner. Wait a second...Cons: Oskar Schell is the most eloquent child in the world. He speaks every line as though he's a thirty year old Shakespearean actor, instead of the ineffectually speaking ten year old that he ought to be. Why in the world does he speak so clearly? It's actually kinda creepy. And eventually very much wore on my nerves. I suppose it fit his character as some sort of improperly undiagnosed Asperger's-affected boy, but that's honestly not really the kind of character with whom I'm prone to identify.I also couldn't identify with his motivation through the course of the movie. I've never particularly struggled with death, but that's most likely some sort of character flaw of my own, and I've also never had to go through the loss of, say, the only person in the world with whom I share some sort of bond. Or even the loss of a parent, for that matter. I'll count myself lucky on that front, obviously, and I will momentarily admit that I actually do remember ""The Worst Day"" and didn't find myself immune to the emotional effects of the movie.Overall: Anyway, when I was able to take myself out of the fairly brow-beating sentiment of the movie and think about it objectively, it didn't necessarily strike me as well done or as eloquent as the boy himself. I think most of the effect of the movie just comes from the ability of nearly every audience member being able to identify with either losing a parent or with the horrific events of 9/11 itself. Or both. And it seemed to cash in fairly ruthlessly on those two things, almost using the crying version of a laugh track, indicating to the audience when they ought to choke up. *Cue double-emotion-whammy Tom-Hanks-as-Falling-Man flashback as I, with teary eyes, give the movie a 6 out of 10.*",3,Blatant Emotion Grab,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",2013,3591,"['Pros', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ve"", 'mentioned', ""'m"", 'kind', 'big', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'fan', 'world', 'cinema', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'confident', 'better', 'actor', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'currently', 'past', 'one', 'caliber', 'come', 'along', 'future', 'would', 'simply', 'be', 'super', 'awesome', 'Second', 'Coming', 'Christ', 'sacrilege', 'comparison', 'might', 'normally', 'imply', 'Accordingly', 'spent', 'much', 'movie', 'hoping', 'Mr.', 'Hanks', 'pop', 'back', 'up', 'screen', 'could', 'cry', 'more', 'fact', 'was', 'dead', 'spoiler', 'only', 'know', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'movie', 'way', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'Hanks', 'best', 'work', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'complain', 'opportunity', 'see', 'strut', 'stuff', 'silver', 'screen', 'Especially', 'when', 'providing', 'excellent', 'parental', 'role', 'model', 'whereby', 'primary', 'function', 'life', 'appeared', 'be', 'blatantly', 'lying', 'son', 'playful', 'sort', ""'m"", 'going', 'fill', 'kid', 'head', 'so', 'many', 'stupid', 'little', 'factual', 'inaccuracies', 'going', 'have', 'complex', 'when', 'older', 'way.Oskar', 'Schell', 'most', 'eloquent', 'child', 'world', 'line', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'instead', 'ineffectually', 'speaking', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'ought', 'be', 'really', 'important', 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'movie', 'understand', 'what', 'characters', 'are', 'saying', 'talking', 'movies', 'year', 'just', 'sidestepped', 'problem', 'completely', 'So', 'anyway', 'was', 'nice', 'quite', 'unbelievably', 'small', 'child', 'was', 'able', 'deliver', 'lines', 'manner', 'could', 'hear', 'understand', 'emotionally', 'raw', 'reality', 'movie', 'have', 'little', 'boy', 'able', 'deliver', 'lines', 'very', 'straight', 'laced', 'non-speech-impeded', 'discernible', 'manner', 'Wait', 'second', 'Cons', 'Oskar', 'Schell', 'most', 'eloquent', 'child', 'world', 'line', 'thirty', 'year', 'old', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'instead', 'ineffectually', 'speaking', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'ought', 'be', 'Why', 'world', 'speak', 'so', 'clearly', 'actually', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'eventually', 'very', 'much', 'wore', 'nerves', 'suppose', 'fit', 'character', 'sort', 'improperly', 'undiagnosed', ""Asperger's-affected"", 'boy', 'honestly', 'not', 'really', 'kind', 'character', 'whom', ""'m"", 'prone', 'identify.I', 'also', 'could', ""n't"", 'identify', 'motivation', 'course', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'particularly', 'struggled', 'death', 'most', 'likely', 'sort', 'character', 'flaw', 'own', ""'ve"", 'also', 'never', 'had', 'go', 'loss', 'say', 'only', 'person', 'world', 'whom', 'share', 'sort', 'bond', 'even', 'loss', 'parent', 'matter', ""'ll"", 'count', 'lucky', 'front', 'obviously', 'will', 'momentarily', 'admit', 'actually', 'do', 'remember', 'Worst', 'Day', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'immune', 'emotional', 'effects', 'movie.Overall', 'Anyway', 'when', 'was', 'able', 'take', 'fairly', 'brow-beating', 'sentiment', 'movie', 'think', 'objectively', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'strike', 'as', 'well', 'done', 'as', 'eloquent', 'boy', 'think', 'most', 'effect', 'movie', 'just', 'ability', 'nearly', 'audience', 'member', 'being', 'able', 'identify', 'losing', 'parent', 'horrific', 'events', '9/11', 'seemed', 'cash', 'fairly', 'ruthlessly', 'two', 'things', 'almost', 'using', 'crying', 'version', 'laugh', 'track', 'indicating', 'audience', 'when', 'ought', 'choke', 'up', '*Cue', 'double-emotion-whammy', 'Tom-Hanks-as-Falling-Man', 'flashback', 'teary', 'eyes', 'give', 'movie', '6', '10', '*']",N/A

Most films fail to esteem themselves beyond the satisfaction offered with character and plotting, which equates to often seeing movies, enjoying them to some extent, and then forgetting them gradually.Every now and then a film comes out that's so unintentionally caustic, so ham-fistedly confrontational with the audience that the memory remains inescapably bad. In such a fashion emerges this little ditty built around the constraint of a child trying to reconnect with his dead father by &#34;solving&#34; a puzzle around the events of the 9/11 attack. Such a conceit could work, I don't dismiss this film as being exploitative in the same fashion that, say, &#34;The Blind Side&#34; comes off, but there is something going on here that ends up feeling much, much worse. The tone surges wildly out of the director's control more often than not, making viewing &#34;Extremely Loud&#34; a real chore to sit through. In turns shrill and sappy, at no point does the melodrama fit the scene. The clumsy symbolism finds its equal in pop radio confections, not serious films, yet the film is (perhaps pretentiously) attempting to do &#34;something serious.&#34;One may be able to excuse this film as a noble failure, but I don't know anyone who actually enjoyed it. After-school specials and product-hocking cartoons work better than this eye-trap. It's a film so rare as to, in an inverted, Ed-Wood-kind-of way, actually merit viewing. The ordeal will definitely teach a viewer how not to control tone in a movie, and in that manner, I say thanks for the lesson.  If you actually seek to enjoy a film, I suggest you give this over-hyped and under-thought piece of derring-do a wide berth. But then, I could be wrong. Maybe the whole terrorist attack can best be summed up with the images of a boy collecting trinkets and yelling into the camera....",1,Prison rape for your eyes and a pillow for your conscience,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,1885,"['Controlling', 'tone', 'difficult', 'film', 'Most', 'films', 'fail', 'esteem', 'satisfaction', 'offered', 'character', 'plotting', 'often', 'seeing', 'movies', 'enjoying', 'extent', 'then', 'forgetting', 'gradually.Every', 'now', 'then', 'film', 'out', 'so', 'unintentionally', 'caustic', 'so', 'ham-fistedly', 'confrontational', 'audience', 'memory', 'inescapably', 'bad', 'such', 'fashion', 'little', 'ditty', 'built', 'constraint', 'child', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'dead', 'father', '34', 'solving', '34', 'puzzle', 'events', '9/11', 'attack', 'conceit', 'could', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'dismiss', 'film', 'being', 'exploitative', 'same', 'fashion', 'say', '34', 'Blind', 'Side', '34', 'something', 'going', 'here', 'up', 'feeling', 'much', 'much', 'worse', 'tone', 'wildly', 'director', 'control', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'making', 'viewing', '34', 'Extremely', 'Loud', '34', 'real', 'chore', 'sit', 'turns', 'shrill', 'sappy', 'point', 'melodrama', 'fit', 'scene', 'clumsy', 'symbolism', 'equal', 'pop', 'radio', 'confections', 'not', 'serious', 'films', 'yet', 'film', 'perhaps', 'pretentiously', 'attempting', 'do', '34', 'something', 'serious.', '34', 'One', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'excuse', 'film', 'noble', 'failure', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anyone', 'who', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'After-school', 'specials', 'product-hocking', 'cartoons', 'work', 'better', 'eye-trap', 'film', 'so', 'rare', 'inverted', 'Ed-Wood-kind-of', 'way', 'actually', 'merit', 'viewing', 'ordeal', 'will', 'definitely', 'teach', 'viewer', 'how', 'not', 'control', 'tone', 'movie', 'manner', 'say', 'thanks', 'lesson', 'actually', 'seek', 'enjoy', 'film', 'suggest', 'give', 'over-hyped', 'under-thought', 'piece', 'derring-do', 'wide', 'berth', 'then', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'Maybe', 'whole', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'can', 'best', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'images', 'boy', 'collecting', 'trinkets', 'yelling', 'camera']",N/A

Tsao ""Seaview1""","[93, 104]","A Boy's Quest in EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSEAmbitious in concept, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close is the love story of a troubled boy whose bond with his father transcends death and events beyond his understanding.  Director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott, The Hours) has put together an interesting study in post trauma and rediscovery.  It doesn't always work, but it still registers on an emotional level.A funeral signals the death of a family member and a boy's alienation to the world.  In flashbacks, Oskar (Thomas Horn), who has trouble communicating and may have Asperger Syndrome, adores his father (Tom Hanks) who challenges him with riddles and treasure hunts to meet people outside his apartment.  Both father and mother (Sandra Bullock) are loving parents, and the world becomes an interesting laboratory for exploration and discovery.  Life is idyllic until 9/11 when everything changes and Oskar is witness to his father's last moments trapped in one of the Twin Towers.  A year later, looking in his father's closet, he discovers a key in an envelope with the letters `black'.  Who or what does the key belong to? Oskar sets out to find out by systematically tracking down every `Black' in the phone book and visiting each person for a clue.  This big scavenger hunt is at best a daunting task.His grandmother who lives across the street has a mysterious renter (Max Von Sydow) who does not speak and can only communicate by jotting on a note pad or displaying `yes' and `no' written on each hand.  The renter takes a liking to Oskar and accompanies him on his quest.  This is a search that proves overwhelming as each person they find has a story too.  When all hope seems lost, the road leads back to that fateful September morning and opens Oskar to the truth about his parents and himself.At first you wonder if this hunt will be meaningful and be rewarded or if it is a waste of time.  Oskar's obsession keeps him connected to his father; to fail is to lose whatever he has left of that relationship.  In a way, it is about trying to make sense of his father's death and coming to terms with it.  It is also about the forgiveness of guilt that nearly consumes Oskar.You kind of think that at some point a miracle may occur or that something profound may happen, but what does reveal itself does not quite answer all the questions, and maybe that's just the  point to the film, that life is part mystery and we never truly understand its riddle.When you take stock of all the people that Oskar encounters, you realize that every one of them can sympathize or has suffered some kind of loss, and how they react to that in relation to Oskar shows how the trauma of loss can be a common bond.  You wish you could learn more about some of these people.Von Sydow gives a memorable performance without uttering a word as the renter who has a personal, family secret.  Why does he remain mute?  Was he a survivor of something so traumatic like the concentration camps of Europe that he does not speak?  In a supporting role, Viola Davis is effective playing a character who figures prominently at the beginning and the end.In the end, Oskar has learned something about himself and his family, and through his journeys, he has matured in a new post-9/11 world.  Ultimately, the revelation at the end is bittersweet and that without the power of forgiveness, closure is incomplete.  It also speaks to a part of humanity that we all share.",4,A Boy's Quest in EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,3457,"['Boy', 'Quest', 'EXTREMELY', 'LOUD', 'INCREDIBLY', 'CLOSEAmbitious', 'concept', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'love', 'story', 'troubled', 'boy', 'bond', 'father', 'death', 'events', 'understanding', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'Hours', 'put', 'together', 'interesting', 'study', 'post', 'trauma', 'rediscovery', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'still', 'emotional', 'level.A', 'funeral', 'signals', 'death', 'family', 'member', 'boy', 'alienation', 'world', 'flashbacks', 'Oskar', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'who', 'trouble', 'communicating', 'may', 'have', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'father', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'riddles', 'treasure', 'hunts', 'meet', 'people', 'apartment', 'father', 'mother', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'are', 'loving', 'parents', 'world', 'interesting', 'laboratory', 'exploration', 'discovery', 'Life', 'idyllic', '9/11', 'when', 'everything', 'changes', 'Oskar', 'witness', 'father', 'last', 'moments', 'trapped', 'one', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'year', 'later', 'looking', 'father', 'closet', 'key', 'envelope', 'letters', 'black', 'Who', 'what', 'key', 'belong', 'Oskar', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'systematically', 'tracking', 'down', 'Black', 'phone', 'book', 'visiting', 'person', 'clue', 'big', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'best', 'daunting', 'task.His', 'grandmother', 'who', 'street', 'mysterious', 'renter', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'not', 'speak', 'can', 'only', 'communicate', 'jotting', 'note', 'pad', 'displaying', 'yes', 'written', 'hand', 'renter', 'liking', 'Oskar', 'quest', 'search', 'overwhelming', 'person', 'find', 'story', 'too', 'When', 'hope', 'lost', 'road', 'back', 'fateful', 'September', 'morning', 'Oskar', 'truth', 'parents', 'himself.At', 'first', 'wonder', 'hunt', 'will', 'be', 'meaningful', 'be', 'rewarded', 'waste', 'time', 'Oskar', 'obsession', 'connected', 'father', 'fail', 'lose', 'whatever', 'left', 'relationship', 'way', 'trying', 'make', 'sense', 'father', 'death', 'coming', 'terms', 'also', 'forgiveness', 'guilt', 'nearly', 'consumes', 'Oskar.You', 'kind', 'think', 'point', 'miracle', 'may', 'occur', 'something', 'profound', 'may', 'happen', 'what', 'reveal', 'not', 'quite', 'answer', 'questions', 'maybe', 'just', 'point', 'film', 'life', 'part', 'mystery', 'never', 'truly', 'understand', 'riddle.When', 'take', 'stock', 'people', 'Oskar', 'realize', 'one', 'can', 'sympathize', 'suffered', 'kind', 'loss', 'how', 'react', 'relation', 'Oskar', 'how', 'trauma', 'loss', 'can', 'be', 'common', 'bond', 'wish', 'could', 'learn', 'more', 'people.Von', 'Sydow', 'memorable', 'performance', 'uttering', 'word', 'renter', 'who', 'personal', 'family', 'secret', 'Why', 'remain', 'mute', 'Was', 'survivor', 'something', 'so', 'traumatic', 'concentration', 'camps', 'Europe', 'not', 'speak', 'supporting', 'role', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'effective', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'prominently', 'beginning', 'end.In', 'end', 'Oskar', 'learned', 'something', 'family', 'journeys', 'matured', 'new', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'Ultimately', 'revelation', 'end', 'bittersweet', 'power', 'forgiveness', 'closure', 'incomplete', 'also', 'part', 'humanity', 'share']",N/A

He becomes obsessed with the phone messages left on the answering machine by his father on the day he died. He begins to self-mutilate by pinching himself until it bruises. During his search for answers... trying to find meaning in his father's loss and trying to hold onto his memory, he finds a key in an envelope with the name ""Black"" on it.  So, he sets out on a trek to talk to every person in NY with the name Black to ask about the key and find out if there is a connection to his father. He befriends his grandmother's tenant, an old man who never speaks, only known as ""the renter"" (Max Von Sydow), and has him join in his quest. In the course of his search, Oskar meets many interesting characters - the various people named Black. He also becomes convinced that ""the renter"" (Sydow) is his grandfather. He also reconnects with his mother when he finds out she has been trailing his trek the whole time.There's no need to explain the story further... it is too complex and involved to sum up. And I won't give away the meaning of the key... you'll have to watch to find out. The story is a bit hard to take in at first, because of the flashbacks and segmented pieces. But, it is a story worth getting into.As for the performances; Thomas Horn as Oskar carries the movie... with a standout performance, Tom Hanks gives a fine performance as the father, Sandra Bullock is very passionate in her portrayal of the mother, Max Von Sydow is outstanding in his role... despite never speaking a word, and Viola Davis gives a wonderful portrayal as Abby Black. The only poor performance in this movie is from John Goodman in a bit part as Stan the Doorman... it seems that his lackluster character portrayal is unnecessary for both the story and the movie.This movie is full of meaning, passion, and deep seeded emotion...

The young boy did an incredible job (and I think this was his first major role) and of course Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock did their usual fabulous acting.  It had a very intriguing plot:  A man goes to a meeting in the World Trade Center (in one of the towers) on 9-11 and is killed.  His son finds a key in his dad's belongings, assumes that it is another of the games he and his dad used to play and starts hunting for who the key belongs to.  But it had some obstacles to overcome.  The main character (the boy) was, in his own words, odd.  In fact, he was very strange and I could easily imagine how hard it was for his mom, confronted with this brilliant little oddity, to figure out how to deal with him.  Actually, the movie worked that out fairly well and it also eventually worked out something that bothered me through a large part of the movie; the fact that this kid ran all over New York, day and night, by himself.  I grew up in a town with about 200 people (living in the town itself; the rural area around it had 3 or 4 times that) and my mother wouldn't let me play in the front yard by myself, even in the daytime.  His mother seemed a little uncaring.  However, as I said, that was explained a little (though not very well, in my opinion) at the end of the movie.  There's some profanity, too, although it's kind of disguised, but not so well that you don't know what he's saying.  And one last thing, I never have figured out where the name came from.  If it was explained in the movie, I missed it.  I suppose it doesn't really matter, but it bothered me.  Bottom line:  it's worth one watch (as anything with Tom Hanks and/or Sandra Bullock probably is) but whether you ever watch it again depends on the type of person you are and what kinds of movies you like.

Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[1, 1]","It takes a very special kind of child actor to carry a heavy dramatic film like EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE.  While Thomas Horn presents an often petulant, quirky Oskar, nonetheless this preteen has exceptional screen presence as a grieving youth on a search to somehow connect with his father (Tom Hanks, who appears throughout the film in flashbacks), who died in one of the Twin Towers during 9/11.  It quickly becomes readily apparent that Oskar had a very close relationship with Thomas, his father, and that Thomas would challenge his son via word games and father/son excursions in Manhattan to broaden the youth's horizons.  The vacuum in Oskar's life is literally unbearable, a vacuum Oskar's mother (Sandra Bullock), to her chagrin, can't ease, and it is only when Oskar finds a mysterious key in a blue vase in his parents' closet that draws him out of his malaise to search New York to find out what door the key unlocks--and perhaps find a message from Thomas.  It appears to be an impossible task, and Oskar grows increasingly frustrated, but there is ultimately a less-than-satisfying payoff.Again, Thomas Horn is an exceptional talent; the pain and anguish his character is experiencing throughout this film is powerful and unflinching.  Bullock and Hanks turn in solid performances--especially Bullock as the film begins to conclude.  But what a second tier of characters!  Max von Sydow is terrific as a mute tenant of Oskar's grandmother who accompanies the boy during his search.  The veteran actor doesn't have a single line, yet the performance he conveys via his facial expressions is astounding.  John Goodman just keeps getting better and better, and here he doesn't disappoint as the doorman of the building where Oskar lives.  And Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are extremely believable as an estranged couple--the first people Oskar visits as he begins his search.  The secret of the key less than satisfies, and the message under the swing seat firmly tweaks suspension of disbelief, but when it comes to a powerful drama that will take your breath away (Thomas's phone messages the morning of 9/11 are stunning examples) and have you wiping away tears, EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE is without peer.--D.

1527243,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B0077ATSSQ,Ed Uyeshima,"[5, 8]","It's been seven years since I read Jonathan Safran Foer's audacious2005 novelwhich despite its deliberate ties to 9/11, left me a bit cold. Director Stephen Daldry (The Reader) and screenwriter Eric Roth (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) have adapted the contemporary plot from the book eschewing the foundational World War II flashback which provided much of the emotional springboard for the 9/11-triggered events that engulf the young protagonist, Oskar, a precocious and lonely eleven-year-old living on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Foer challenged the reader by making Oskar borderline autistic in order to dissect the psychological devastation induced by 9/11 in its most basic terms with the loss of his father. Daldry and Roth wisely chose a first-time actor, Thomas Horn, to embody Oskar as someone more experienced would have likely come across as too mannered and sympathetic for such a polarizing figure. On the other hand, Horn, a former Jeopardy! champion, embodies the character's sharp intellect, lack of amiability, and monomaniacal sense of purpose with surprising acuity. It's either an impressive debut or an exhausting one-shot performance as he is in almost every scene of the film.On his own idiosyncratic terms, Daldry attempts to present 9/11 as a malevolent, almost surreal act that turns an otherwise banal and safe world into one of seeping paranoia and immeasurable fear. Still reeling from the World Trade Center death of his gregarious, life-loving father Thomas, Oskar has hidden the phone machine, on which his father left six messages, away from his low-key attorney mother Linda. A year after the tragedy, the troubled boy finds a unique way to deal with his grief when he inadvertently breaks a blue vase in his father's closet as he rifles through his father's effects hoping for some kind of message left behind. Finding an envelope with a key inside the broken vase, Oskar notices the envelope is marked ""Black"", and his imagination reels with what he thinks is the legacy of his father's scavenger hunts. Tethered to nothing in the way of logic, he sets out across the breadth of New York City to meet and question all 472 people named Black in the phone book, so he can find out what the key unlocks. This is where Oskar's quest takes flight as he bounces from one encounter to another looking for a clue.Joining him for much of his journey is the Renter, a mute tenant that his grandmother shelters in her apartment across the street. His identity holds a certain clue to the mystery surrounding his father but not the one Oskar is looking for. The boy also intersects with a divorcing couple who tie into another thread of the mystery. As it does in the source novel, all of the events and character tics come across as rather contrived to support the 9/11 allegory being presented, even though the film itself is handsomely produced with first-rate camerawork by Chris Menges. The performances by the rest of the cast compensate as well. In small supporting roles despite their star billing, Tom Hanks is ideally cast as Thomas, and Sandra Bullock - in her first role sinceThe Blind Side- brings quiet dignity and strength to Linda. Viola Davis (The Help) and Jeffrey Wright (The Ides of March) make vivid cameo impressions as the angst-filled couple, while Max Von Sydow (The Seventh Seal) does wonders in a restrained turn as the Renter. But the film's emotional burden never really elevates the themes that Daldry wants desperately to convey in a sea of contrivance. Ultimately, this narrative burden makes 9/11 fade into the background more than it should, and one is left with the forlorn feeling that the event has been more exploited than explored.",3,9/11 as a Dramatic Device Both Contrived and Affecting,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",2012,3703,"['been', 'seven', 'years', 'read', 'Jonathan', 'Safran', 'Foer', 'audacious2005', 'novelwhich', 'deliberate', 'ties', '9/11', 'left', 'bit', 'cold', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Reader', 'screenwriter', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'Curious', 'Case', 'Benjamin', 'Button', 'have', 'adapted', 'contemporary', 'plot', 'book', 'eschewing', 'foundational', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'flashback', 'provided', 'much', 'emotional', 'springboard', '9/11-triggered', 'events', 'engulf', 'young', 'protagonist', 'Oskar', 'precocious', 'lonely', 'eleven-year-old', 'living', 'Manhattan', 'Upper', 'West', 'Side', 'Foer', 'challenged', 'reader', 'making', 'Oskar', 'borderline', 'autistic', 'order', 'dissect', 'psychological', 'devastation', 'induced', '9/11', 'most', 'basic', 'terms', 'loss', 'father', 'Daldry', 'Roth', 'wisely', 'chose', 'first-time', 'actor', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'embody', 'Oskar', 'someone', 'more', 'experienced', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'come', 'too', 'mannered', 'sympathetic', 'such', 'polarizing', 'figure', 'other', 'hand', 'Horn', 'former', 'Jeopardy', 'champion', 'character', 'sharp', 'intellect', 'lack', 'amiability', 'monomaniacal', 'sense', 'purpose', 'surprising', 'acuity', 'impressive', 'debut', 'exhausting', 'one-shot', 'performance', 'almost', 'scene', 'film.On', 'own', 'idiosyncratic', 'terms', 'Daldry', 'present', '9/11', 'malevolent', 'almost', 'surreal', 'act', 'otherwise', 'banal', 'safe', 'world', 'one', 'seeping', 'paranoia', 'immeasurable', 'fear', 'Still', 'reeling', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'death', 'gregarious', 'life-loving', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Oskar', 'hidden', 'phone', 'machine', 'father', 'left', 'six', 'messages', 'away', 'low-key', 'attorney', 'mother', 'Linda', 'year', 'tragedy', 'troubled', 'boy', 'unique', 'way', 'deal', 'grief', 'when', 'inadvertently', 'blue', 'vase', 'father', 'closet', 'father', 'effects', 'hoping', 'kind', 'message', 'left', 'behind', 'Finding', 'envelope', 'key', 'broken', 'vase', 'Oskar', 'envelope', 'marked', 'Black', 'imagination', 'reels', 'what', 'legacy', 'father', 'scavenger', 'hunts', 'Tethered', 'nothing', 'way', 'logic', 'out', 'breadth', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'meet', 'question', '472', 'people', 'named', 'Black', 'phone', 'book', 'can', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'key', 'unlocks', 'where', 'Oskar', 'quest', 'flight', 'one', 'encounter', 'looking', 'clue.Joining', 'much', 'journey', 'Renter', 'mute', 'tenant', 'grandmother', 'shelters', 'apartment', 'street', 'identity', 'certain', 'clue', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'father', 'not', 'one', 'Oskar', 'looking', 'boy', 'also', 'divorcing', 'couple', 'who', 'thread', 'mystery', 'source', 'novel', 'events', 'character', 'tics', 'come', 'rather', 'contrived', 'support', '9/11', 'allegory', 'being', 'presented', 'even', 'film', 'handsomely', 'produced', 'first-rate', 'camerawork', 'Chris', 'Menges', 'performances', 'rest', 'cast', 'compensate', 'well', 'small', 'supporting', 'roles', 'star', 'billing', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'ideally', 'cast', 'Thomas', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'first', 'role', 'sinceThe', 'Blind', 'Side-', 'quiet', 'dignity', 'strength', 'Linda', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Help', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'Ides', 'March', 'make', 'vivid', 'cameo', 'impressions', 'angst-filled', 'couple', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'Seventh', 'Seal', 'wonders', 'restrained', 'turn', 'Renter', 'film', 'emotional', 'burden', 'never', 'really', 'themes', 'Daldry', 'desperately', 'convey', 'sea', 'contrivance', 'Ultimately', 'narrative', 'burden', '9/11', 'fade', 'background', 'more', 'should', 'one', 'left', 'forlorn', 'feeling', 'event', 'been', 'more', 'exploited', 'explored']",N/A

Stephen Daldry, 130 minutes) is an Oscar nominee that introduces us to young Oskar Schell (the stunning and beautiful Thomas Horn), a jittery, rude and impulsive autistic genius from New York. (Well, as a sufferer of Asperger's Autism, which Oskar calls ""Asperger's Disease"", I saw it clearly. In the film, Oskar stipulates that the diagnosis for him was ""uncertain"". However, I was certain.)Set between September 11, 2001 and September 11, 2002, this is the story of Oskar's loss: his beloved father (Tom Hanks) who was in WTC Tower I on the ""Worse Day"". At a certain point in time, Oskar pictures his father as one of the unfortunates who either jumped or fell from the tower prior to its collapse. Since his father seemed to be training him to investigate and think like a scientist, young Oskar is astonished one day when he finds a mysterious key amongst his father's effects.This film is Oskar's story, a story about his dogged search for the lock which will be opened by that key. Along the way, Oskar discovers his (sort of) long-lost grandfather ... and I will leave it at that in case you haven't seen this. I may add that this is the only film I've ever seen that was carried by the memory of Tom Hanks rather than by his actual presence. It is immensely sad and rather funny. I think Hitchcock would have made this film like this.In its simple complexity, its riveting emptiness, its joyous sadness, you will be swept along as I was - in tears yet not really knowing exactly what those tears mean. Those tears - and you WILL cry them - is one of the story's purposes. With the sublime talents of Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, Sandra Bullock as Oskar's mother and the immortal Max von Sydow as Oskar's grandfather (credited as ""the renter"" so as not to spoil the obvious surprise, and still stunning at 84). Though James Gandolfini is credited, he does not appear at all. As yet I have not determined whether Jonathan Safran Foer did a walk-on.Jonathan Safran Foer wrote the original novel,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (Movie Tie-In): A Novel. Fans might recall his astonishing semi-autobiographical novelEverything Is Illuminated: A Novelwhich was made into a fantastic film,Everything Is Illuminated(in which he made an interesting walk-on; see my review). At the very least, you might recall him from a cable show he hosted for a while, entitled something like ""JON SAFRAN VERSUS GOD"" because Safran is an atheist. Astonishing that this intellectual, autistic type with his obsessions (collecting, the past, grandfathers, Jewish heritage, life journeys, people's life-stories, rigid searches) has managed to express so much so beautifully.Stephen Daldry is best known for his brilliant directing in another film that introduced us to a sweet young boy, named Jamie Bell, inBilly Elliot. Bell has fulfilled the skyrocketing star worthy of his status, and I have a feeling about young Thomas Horn as well. So long as they don't end up like my beloved Elijah Wood, I'll be happy.It is a privilege to live in a time with this young man.

Many, of course, have painful and permanent losses to deal with.  For myself, we were far from home on that day, and I truly felt that something of our world had ended.  Which, in fact it had.  So when it was announced that there would be a movie, Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which would touch on those tragic events, our first response was, ""No, we don't think so.""  Then we learned who was to be in this movie, and the cast included so many of our favorite actors:  Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, Max von Sydow, John Goodman, people we felt we could trust to do such a subject justice, and we said, ""Well....""  Then we learned more about the story of the film (and story is everything, to us) and we asked ourselves, ""How could we not see it?""And I'm so very glad we did.  Everyone is predictably excellent.  The story is beautifully done, and at the same time simple and deeply layered.  The child actor makes you believe he is dealing with the personal problems of the child character.  These problems would be unique and difficult enough, if they did not also include the loss of an incredible father under horrific circumstances, and you share the pain of this family of grandmother, mother and son, while the story is told from so many different directions.  Being one of those who cry at Hallmark commercials, I am always loathe to see any movie or play or read any book that wants to make me cry.  But this movie is not like that.  I did just fine throughout the entire story, experiencing it intensely but dry-eyed.  Until the end.  Until I got to the point where I could fully appreciate the efforts this family made to move forward, the grace with which they and the families they represented dealt with what they were given.  Until I could see the wonder of the story.It was terrible in the parts that invoked the events that we already knew had happened; it became wonderful beyond my power of description because of a boy on a swing.

Eric Roth has done the near impossible task of translating Safran Foer's language and method of storytelling into a film script that for the most part works on every level. As directed with the inordinate sensitivity of Stephen Daldry the impact of not only the book, but also a restoration of the events of that fateful day in the history of this country, are unveiled in a manner that not only makes a long film seem short but also is able to tie together the various characters and incidents of this story on film that provides on of the most sensitive bouquets of the meaning of the Family of Man.Oskar Schell is inhabited by Thomas Horn, a youngster making his first film and his lack of expected sophistication of acting only makes this terrified but determined lad more credible.  Tom Hanks is Oskar's beloved jeweler father who leaves voice mails during the collapse of the buildings, messages that Oskar keeps to himself (we find out later why), not even sharing the connect with his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock).  Through a series of discoveries Oskar finds a key in an envelope with the single word `Black' on it and he sets out to find the source of the key and in doing so reconnected with his deceased father. He is joined by the mute Renter (Max von Sydow) who lives next to his Grandma (Zoe Caldwell) and together they comb New York meeting everyone with the name of Black - and in the process we encounter some superb cameos by Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright, John Goodman, an uncredited appearance by Eddie Izzard and many more. Oskar's journey finally comes to an end in a most touching way as the truths are revealed.The surprise of this film is the manner in which as much attention is subtly played with the amalgamation of people that comprise New York: children and adults with mental disorders, Jews, African Americans, immigrants of all sorts, fey cross dressers, angry people, kind people - everyone has a story that is equally important as Oskar's pursuit. This technique magnifies the message of Safran Foer's story - that we are all linked by a common bond. This film is an experience. Share it.

Look for anything else and miss the plot. Be disappointed. Totally loose sight of the masterful acting of the kid, Oskar (Thomas Horn's 1st role). The big stars were merely box office draw and supporting roles.Not really 9.11 but a child's reaction to survivor's grief.It's not often that a new kid on the block, never before acted in anything, can upstage the likes of Tom Hanks, Viola Davis and even Sandra Bullock. Although Bullock did do an excellent job at the end of the film. There were a few more names to toss in there in rather insignificant roles, but it all goes back to a kid, his story, his struggle, his mental ability, and disability, and hidden horror within himself. Poor kid. Horn played it perfect. A natural actor or exquisite directing and writing. All three?Maybe the mental anguish displayed is too much, too early, for many. For some 20 years later will be too short. Watching the physical destruction of 9.11 is easier than viewing the mental attack.A boy's mind becomes a complex mystery of the key--a coping mechanism. Find the lock, find his dad, find forgiveness? Every step the child autistically timed to precision.It's a troubling journey that real autistic children struggle though and its no more their fault than 9.11 was the fault of its victims. Not a pretty - touchy - feel-good story. It's reality of a living victim's worst day continuation into living after experiencing a death.A truly moving story at least well worth a rental, as I did.

I personally see no fault or problem in films being made about the event, as long as it doesn't in any way come off as exploitative (I'm pointing at YOU, World Trade Center).  Many I know say they usually pass on 9/11 films due to having already lived through it, but have you?  With that in mind, on with the review.This past Tuesday, the Academy announced their nominations for this year's Oscars.  Among them was Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close, which was greeted with applause as it was revealed it nabbed a Best Picture nomination.  So today, I've decided to see the film for myself, and I have to honestly say I was left feeling disappointed.Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks), a loving husband and father, was killed on 9/11 during a meeting at the World Trade Center.  He leaves behind his distraught wife Linda (Bullock) and his always-curious son Oskar (Horn), born with a natural sense for adventure and seeing things through.  Weeks after ""the worst day"" as he calls it, Oskar is shuffling through his deceased father's closet when he knocks over a vase containing a key, which is in a small envelope with ""Black"" written on it.To make all sorts of explaining really short, he sets off on an expedition in New York City.  His plan is to find every person with the last name ""Black"" in all the five boroughs, hoping to get information about the mystery key.  Along the way he meets many people facing problems of their own, including a sheltered and mute-by-choice old man (Max Von Sydow, in the best performance of this movie) who only goes by the alias `The Renter.'Along the way, Oskar slowly pries his way into the Renter's mysterious life and equally strains his relationship with his mother, all in the hope of getting another chance at a few more minutes of spiritual face-time with his father.I'm not gonna lie, I loved the story.  However, screenwriters Eric Roth and Jonathan Foer pulled a few cinematic punches I didn't really like.  Parts of the way the story was told seem to deceive us, almost to the point of leaving an inconsistent pace.  This left me as an audience member feeling disjointed and asking myself if parts of the film were indeed the exploitation I was speaking of earlier.I was left feeling like if this film's background was based on anything BESIDES 9/11, this film would be absolutely forgettable and the Academy would pay no heed.  I'm not saying I feel like the film ONLY got Oscar attention because of that legitimate ""worst day,"" I'm just saying that let's say Tom Hanks was killed in a car wreck or something, then the eventual moral of this film would be completely ruined before the quarter-mark.  The way 9/11 was used as a deliberate dramatic device instead of a legitimate piece of the plot is extortion.",2,"Extremely Loud, Yet Incredibly Dull",1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,2857,"['dig', 'review', 'let', 'give', 'bit', 'spiel', 'regarding', 'opinion', '9/11-based', 'movies', 'personally', 'see', 'fault', 'problem', 'films', 'being', 'made', 'event', 'as', 'long', ""n't"", 'way', 'come', 'off', 'exploitative', ""'m"", 'pointing', 'YOU', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Many', 'know', 'say', 'usually', 'pass', '9/11', 'films', 'due', 'having', 'already', 'lived', 'have', 'mind', 'review.This', 'past', 'Tuesday', 'Academy', 'announced', 'nominations', 'year', 'Oscars', 'was', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'was', 'greeted', 'applause', 'was', 'revealed', 'nabbed', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nomination', 'So', 'today', ""'ve"", 'decided', 'see', 'film', 'myself', 'have', 'honestly', 'say', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'disappointed.Thomas', 'Schell', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'loving', 'husband', 'father', 'was', 'killed', '9/11', 'meeting', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'distraught', 'wife', 'Linda', 'Bullock', 'always-curious', 'son', 'Oskar', 'Horn', 'born', 'natural', 'sense', 'adventure', 'seeing', 'things', 'Weeks', 'worst', 'day', 'Oskar', 'shuffling', 'deceased', 'father', 'closet', 'when', 'over', 'vase', 'containing', 'key', 'small', 'envelope', 'Black', 'written', 'it.To', 'make', 'sorts', 'explaining', 'really', 'short', 'off', 'expedition', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'plan', 'find', 'person', 'last', 'name', 'Black', 'five', 'boroughs', 'hoping', 'get', 'information', 'mystery', 'key', 'way', 'many', 'people', 'facing', 'problems', 'own', 'including', 'sheltered', 'mute-by-choice', 'old', 'man', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'who', 'only', 'alias', 'Renter', 'way', 'Oskar', 'slowly', 'way', 'Renter', 'mysterious', 'life', 'equally', 'relationship', 'mother', 'hope', 'getting', 'chance', 'few', 'more', 'minutes', 'spiritual', 'face-time', 'father.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'gon', 'lie', 'loved', 'story', 'However', 'screenwriters', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'Jonathan', 'Foer', 'pulled', 'few', 'cinematic', 'punches', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'like', 'Parts', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'told', 'seem', 'deceive', 'almost', 'point', 'leaving', 'inconsistent', 'pace', 'left', 'audience', 'member', 'feeling', 'disjointed', 'asking', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'indeed', 'exploitation', 'was', 'speaking', 'earlier.I', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'film', 'background', 'was', 'based', 'anything', 'BESIDES', '9/11', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'absolutely', 'forgettable', 'Academy', 'would', 'pay', 'heed', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'feel', 'film', 'ONLY', 'got', 'Oscar', 'attention', 'legitimate', 'worst', 'day', ""'m"", 'just', 'saying', 'let', 'say', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'wreck', 'something', 'then', 'eventual', 'moral', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'ruined', 'quarter-mark', 'way', '9/11', 'was', 'used', 'deliberate', 'dramatic', 'device', 'instead', 'legitimate', 'piece', 'plot', 'extortion']",N/A

At the funeral, his son Oskar (Thomas Horn) recalls how his father told him about the five boroughs of New York City, but there was a sixth borough right next to Manhattan. No one knows where it is because it floated away. Oskar wants to find the Sixth Borough and his father gives him a map to search for clues. Central Park is not in the same place it used to be. It was in the center of the Sixth Borough. Enormous hooks were driven deep into the ground and the park was pulled by all the people of New York into Manhattan.His father mentions one very important clue that a note came from the Sixth Borough.One year later, he decides to look through his father's wardrobe closet. It had not been touched since that fatal day. Oskar looks for stuff and accidentally knocks over a small blue vase. it breaks on the floor. He discovers a small manilla envelope. There is a key inside.Oskar begins his journey to find out who the key may belong to and what does it unlock.Also in the cast: Sandra Bullock, Zoe Caldwell, Max Von Sydow, John Goodman, Stephen Henderson, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright.While this movie does have its flaws, I do appreciate how the father had every intent of finishing this game out with his son and providing the clues along the way. He was actually trying to help his son find the final clue to the Sixth Borough, but because the 9-year old child was being stubborn and frustrated, the boy didn't find the clue in front of his father. That is what the father wanted was to see his son excited and happy to finally find the final clue, but it wasn't going to happen on that day.His father had died unexpectedly on September 11, 2001.All the clues were still in place.Option of Language and Subtitles: English, French, Spanish.",3,Boy tells with the death of his father in 9/11.,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2012,1966,"['Based', 'book', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'Movie', 'Tie-In', 'Novel', '2005', 'Jonathan', 'Safran.The', 'movie', 'Thomas', 'Schell', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'having', 'died', 'September', '11', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'tragedy', 'funeral', 'son', 'Oskar', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'how', 'father', 'told', 'five', 'boroughs', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'there', 'was', 'sixth', 'borough', 'right', 'next', 'Manhattan', 'one', 'where', 'floated', 'away', 'Oskar', 'find', 'Sixth', 'Borough', 'father', 'map', 'search', 'clues', 'Central', 'Park', 'not', 'same', 'place', 'used', 'be', 'was', 'center', 'Sixth', 'Borough', 'Enormous', 'hooks', 'were', 'driven', 'deep', 'ground', 'park', 'was', 'pulled', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'Manhattan.His', 'father', 'mentions', 'one', 'very', 'important', 'clue', 'note', 'came', 'Sixth', 'Borough.One', 'year', 'later', 'look', 'father', 'wardrobe', 'closet', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'touched', 'fatal', 'day', 'Oskar', 'stuff', 'accidentally', 'knocks', 'small', 'blue', 'vase', 'floor', 'small', 'manilla', 'envelope', 'key', 'inside.Oskar', 'journey', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'key', 'may', 'belong', 'what', 'unlock.Also', 'cast', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Zoe', 'Caldwell', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Stephen', 'Henderson', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright.While', 'movie', 'have', 'flaws', 'do', 'appreciate', 'how', 'father', 'had', 'intent', 'finishing', 'game', 'out', 'son', 'providing', 'clues', 'way', 'was', 'actually', 'trying', 'help', 'son', 'find', 'final', 'clue', 'Sixth', 'Borough', '9-year', 'old', 'child', 'was', 'being', 'stubborn', 'frustrated', 'boy', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'clue', 'front', 'father', 'what', 'father', 'wanted', 'was', 'see', 'son', 'excited', 'happy', 'finally', 'find', 'final', 'clue', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'happen', 'day.His', 'father', 'had', 'died', 'unexpectedly', 'September', '11', '2001.All', 'clues', 'were', 'still', 'place.Option', 'Language', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish']",N/A

These are not a-typical games, but adventures where the youngster must visit odd places, talk to complete strangers and read many books to solve riddles.The games stop on 9/11. Thomas, a jeweler by trade, has a meeting in the World Trade Center when the planes hit. He makes repeated calls home, which Oskar hears later via the answering machine. Their is no body in the casket for the funeral so Oskar has no closure.He can't help but think this is another elaborate puzzle his father has left behind to solve.It begins when he finds a key inside a small manila envelope inside of a blue vase.

I suppose having lost a Dad almost as wonderful as Oskar had could be why it touched me so deeply, even though we lost them in very different ways.*****SPOILER ALERT***** for the rest of the review****This movie is about a little boy named Oskar Schell (played with just the right emotion and finesse by Thomas Horn) who has a father and a mother and lives in Manhattan. Oskar is very intelligent and his father (a splendid performance by Tom Hanks) spends a lot of time helping him overcome his many anxieties and expanding his world. Including the fact that there used to be SIX boroughs, instead of five now, which made up New York City. And therein lies much of the wonder of this story.His father was a jeweler, but on September 11, 2001, he had a meeting on a very high floor in one of the Twin Towers. Oskar doesn't know any of this, of course, and when the airplanes hit the towers, he was let go from school to go home. Oskar's father tries five times to call him at home to say goodbye, leaving uplifting, loving messages. Unfortunately, Oscar doesn't make it home until the sixth message comes in. When he hears the phone ringing, Oskar freezes and cannot answer. He listens as his father leaves a sixth labored message where, in the background he can hear glass breaking and people screaming. And this is pretty much the center of this movie.How does a little boy come back from such a moment, losing such a loving father, he could not even pick up the phone and listen to his last message from as he was dying? At first, the movie is a bit disjointed and confusing since we don't learn these things until it is tied up at the end of the movie.Oskar is a curious little boy and one night he meets a neighbor across the courtyard in his grandmother's apartment (we aren't told where his grandmother has gone). But Oskar is on a mission. One day shortly after his father was killed, Oskar finally decides to go into his closet. Inside, his curiosity gets him in trouble as usual, a blue vase lying on the top shelf comes tumbling down on his head, breaks into many pieces. Inside Oskar finds a key in a small manilla envelope with the word Black written on it. Because of the lessons taught to him by his father, Oskar begins his search for whom the key belongs and what he will find inside the lock box the key will fit. Inside of his grandmother's apartment he meets an old man played with the excellence only Max Von Sydow can. The old man joins Oskar's search. He has gotten all of the phone books for all of the boroughs of NYC, circles all the people named Black, and intends to visit each one every weekend, until he finds the one the key belongs to. I think this section is perhaps the most brilliant section of the movie. We, in the audience, already pretty much know that this man is his missing grandfather, Oskar's father's father. And the relationship formed by the two is magical. Von Sydow plays the old man as mute, so he has to write everything down. On one hand he writes yes, and on the other, no. This way, it's a simple way to answer yes or no questions. I was enthralled, watching the ever amazing Von Sydow, a genius of an actor and perhaps one of the best of his profession we've ever been graced with. His relationship with Oskar is always tenuous, we feel his discomfort many times as he tries to help his grandson through his terrifying grief, through this search for the key's box and what he will find inside that might hold the answers as to why Oskar lost his father so outrageously rudely. One day, Oskar decides to play all the messages for him, but Von Sydow cannot handle hearing his son's voice as it gets ever more fearful and difficult to breathe due to toxic fumes. And he leaves.Oskar is devastated. But of course, in the end, he manages to find the owner of the key, and learns that the key fits a lock box for someone else who lost someone on that terrible day. But that's not what this story is really about. It is really about a little boy's journey toward healing and, as we learn near the end, his seemingly absent mother, played by the always spectacular Sandra Bullock, who, unbeknownst to Oskar, has mapped out his course and visits each Black before Oskar gets there to let them know he will be coming and why. Here is where we get many of the answers that plagued us because, first of all, why would a mother be missing in action the way she seemed to be, and often, the people visited seemed as if they were waiting for him. As Oskar and his mother make this journey, we learn that both find healing in the process. In the end, Oskar writes a letter to each person he has visited and tells them he found the person the key belonged to and thanked them for their help.This is not a new story. We have certainly seen versions of it before, maybe not for the 9/11 incident, but for many others who are searching for meaning of losing a lost one. What separates this movie from others, is probably the excellent cast, with excellent directing, and a story, while as old as time, never seems to get old. Learning to forgive oneself for things left undone for a loved lost one can be one of the hardest things we, as imperfect human beings need to learn. That this happened on 9/11 wasn't the center of the story. The story teaches us that each journey toward letting go of our anger and hurt toward our lost loved one, is different. But never the less, needs to happen. In the end, Oskar writes to his grandfather and asks him to come ""home"" (he does), and he overcomes his fear of swinging on a set of swings in a NYC park. During his high swing, he notices something at the bottom of the swing. His father, which we saw at the beginning of the movie trying to get him on these swings, left him the note stuffed into the bottom of the swing. In it he tells Oskar that he has finished his journey - in so doing, he has discovered that the missing sixth borough is simply all the people who have finished THEIR journey thus learning what life is all about - overcoming our fear and moving on to live life with all the joy they possibly can.I'm afraid I can't add anything to that. It's just about right. And in a little way, with Oskar, I joined him in understanding where the people in the sixth borough went. A truly beautiful little movie with a HUGE role for Thomas Horn. Bravo, young man. And to the rest of the cast and crew of this amazing movie, two thumbs up. It was entertaining, and for anybody who has lost a deeply loved one, it is touching and another little secret in how to let go, but never forget. It is not preachy and I never felt a moment's discomfort for my own loss. I did, however, feel the joy of Oskar's discovery at the end. As the survivor of losing such a loved one, this can be a tricky task for a movie. It might be difficult for some people to watch, especially the recordings on the answering machines, but I would encourage any of you who have not seen it, whether you have lost a loved one or not, SEE THIS MOVIE. Some (most) movies make you wish you could get those two hours invested in that loser back. This one is like Goldie Locks says, just right! THIS is why I watch movies. As I have said before (and will again here on Amazon), you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find the prince (or princess). This one is worth kissing!",5,EXTREMELY WONDERFUL AND INCREDIBLY TOUCHING,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,7485,"['have', 'just', 'finished', 'watching', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'am',

1527289,A3UXQLM9I775JJ,B0077ATSSQ,"Kristofer Sandlund ""The Storyteller""","[8, 10]","Possibly the most unique movie of the past few years. Oscar, played by Thomas Horn, carries the weight of the movie on his capable shoulders. He appears to be an autistic savant, possibly Aspergers syndrome. Oscar has lost his father in the twin towers attack of 9/11.  Here is what I found challenging- we empathize with his loss, but find it difficult to relate to him personally. Simply put- he isn't a very likable young man. He swears at the security guard and is rather mean to his mother; however,  I believe his story is one of the best portrayals of grief response I have ever seen. In real life, whether autistic or not, people don't always respond to life's trials with grace. It hurts... it hurts bad, and maybe the last thing they need are superficial pat statements such as ""It will all work for good"", ""He is in a better place"", or ""He's still alive because he's alive in your heart"".  Please note- I personally believe that these comments are true, but for the person in grief, they can be detrimental- each of the comments listed are also saying-""You shouldn't be hurting as badly as you are"".Oscar, on a quest to solve his ""father's final mystery"" is desperately trying to hold on to his father- the ""only one"" who really understood him. SPOILER ALERT- ENDING REVEALED BEYOND THIS POINT- While watching this movie, I found myself becoming  critical of the storyline. There were 2 growing issues. 1. Why were all these strangers allowing Oscar into their homes and lives? It seemed unrealistic to me, right from the first Mrs. Black that he visited. Why did she open the door? 2. Why was the mother so distant from Oscar? Sandra Bullock's character was grieving too, but she appeared to be nothing more than a movie prop.  Alas, I was so wrong on both accounts! She knew exactly what Oscar was doing, and had secretly visited all the Black's on the list in advance- to lovingly make her son's journey an easier one!  What a beautiful ending! What love this mother has for her child! She knows him- as well as her husband did. She is his guardian angel, his protector, and his champion. She understood what no other human being on the planet could have understood- Oscar needed this journey, this quest, in order to find peace- to make ""sense"" of something senseless. WOW!One last point- I stated earlier that Oscar is not a real likable little boy- that too is wrong.  He is grieving, he is a bit ""different"", and he doesn't talk respectfully to adults- but... he is absolutely wonderful. I will never forget the wonder and beauty of one scene- He has harsh words with his mother, he leaves, but then stops... he whispers through the bottom of a closed door ""I love you"". He isn't sure if she is even there to hear it, but of course she is... she's always there. If you are a parent, especially if you have a child with special needs, this movie stands as a testament to the beauty of what you do each and every day. It isn't easy, and most will never know of the love and the sacrifices you make- but you are your child's angel... his protector... her champion!",5,"Unique, Disturbing, & Beautiful",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",2012,3079,"['Possibly', 'most', 'unique', 'movie', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Oscar', 'played', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'weight', 'movie', 'capable', 'shoulders', 'be', 'autistic', 'savant', 'possibly', 'Aspergers', 'syndrome', 'Oscar', 'lost', 'father', 'twin', 'towers', 'attack', '9/11', 'Here', 'what', 'found', 'challenging-', 'empathize', 'loss', 'find', 'difficult', 'relate', 'personally', 'Simply', 'put-', ""n't"", 'very', 'likable', 'young', 'man', 'security', 'guard', 'rather', 'mean', 'mother', 'however', 'believe', 'story', 'one', 'best', 'portrayals', 'grief', 'response', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'real', 'life', 'autistic', 'not', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'respond', 'life', 'trials', 'grace', 'bad', 'maybe', 'last', 'thing', 'need', 'are', 'superficial', 'pat', 'statements', 'such', 'will', 'work', 'good', 'better', 'place', 'still', 'alive', 'alive', 'heart', 'Please', 'note-', 'personally', 'believe', 'comments', 'are', 'true', 'person', 'grief', 'can', 'be', 'detrimental-', 'comments', 'listed', 'are', 'also', 'saying-', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'hurting', 'as', 'badly', 'are', '.Oscar', 'quest', 'solve', 'father', 'final', 'mystery', 'desperately', 'trying', 'hold', 'father-', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'really', 'understood', 'SPOILER', 'ALERT-', 'ENDING', 'REVEALED', 'BEYOND', 'THIS', 'POINT-', 'watching', 'movie', 'found', 'becoming', 'critical', 'storyline', 'were', '2', 'growing', 'issues', '1', 'Why', 'were', 'strangers', 'allowing', 'Oscar', 'homes', 'lives', 'seemed', 'unrealistic', 'right', 'first', 'Mrs.', 'Black', 'visited', 'Why', 'did', 'open', 'door', '2', 'Why', 'was', 'mother', 'so', 'distant', 'Oscar', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'character', 'was', 'grieving', 'too', 'appeared', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'movie', 'prop', 'Alas', 'was', 'so', 'wrong', 'accounts', 'knew', 'exactly', 'what', 'Oscar', 'was', 'doing', 'had', 'secretly', 'visited', 'Black', 'list', 'advance-', 'lovingly', 'make', 'son', 'journey', 'easier', 'one', 'What', 'beautiful', 'ending', 'What', 'love', 'mother', 'child', 'him-', 'as', 'well', 'husband', 'did', 'guardian', 'angel', 'protector', 'champion', 'understood', 'what', 'other', 'human', 'being', 'planet', 'could', 'have', 'understood-', 'Oscar', 'needed', 'journey', 'quest', 'order', 'find', 'peace-', 'make', 'sense', 'something', 'senseless', 'WOW', 'One', 'last', 'point-', 'stated', 'earlier', 'Oscar', 'not', 'real', 'likable', 'little', 'boy-', 'too', 'wrong', 'grieving', 'bit', 'different', ""n't"", 'talk', 'respectfully', 'adults-', 'absolutely', 'wonderful', 'will', 'never', 'forget', 'wonder', 'beauty', 'one', 'scene-', 'harsh', 'words', 'mother', 'then', 'stops', 'bottom', 'closed', 'door', 'love', ""n't"", 'sure', 'even', 'hear', 'course', 'always', 'there', 'are', 'parent', 'especially', 'have', 'child', 'special', 'needs', 'movie', 'testament', 'beauty', 'what', 'do', 'day', ""n't"", 'easy', 'most', 'will', 'never', 'know', 'love', 'sacrifices', 'make-', 'are', 'child', 'angel', 'protector', 'champion']",N/A

The acting is exceptional, the theme a haunting one and even though there are some parts of the plot that do not ring true, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts and it left me deeply moved, sad and crying at the end.Tom Hanks is cast as a father who is deeply committed to his 9-year old son.  The son, brilliantly played by young Thomas Horn, who may or may not have Asperger's Syndrome, is extremely intelligent although afraid of such things as going on a swing in the park.  His father spends a lot of time with the boy and is committed to educating him.  The boy thrives on this.  And then, suddenly, the date is September 11, 2001 and the father is at a meeting on the 105th floor of the World Trade Center and makes several panicky calls home which get recorded on voice mail.  Sandra Bullock plays the mother in a heart rendering role.  She and her son have never been close and the boy resents her even though she deeply loves him and does her best to get him through the hard time he is having.One day the boy finds a key in his father's closet.  It is in a small brown envelope with the word ""Black"" on it.  The boy assumes that this must be a person with the last name of Black and then sets out on a voyage of discovery to visit every single one of the 472 people in New York City with the last name of Black.  Soon he is joined by an old man in his eighties, played by Max Von Sydow who doesn't speak and who communicates through writing on a notepad..  Together they travel the city and there are a few humorous and heartfelt moments between them.  Eventually the boy does discover the truth about the key although it is not what he expected.There were a few problems with this film in general.  How can such a young boy be permitted to travel around the city alone? Where was the mother?  Eventually, in an emotional conclusion demonstrating fine acting by Sandra Bullock, we do find out but it's hard to believe that the plot could have really happened this way.Clearly, this is the saddest film I have ever seen and I will long remember it with tears in my eyes.  That is why I just stop short of giving it my highest recommendation. I do not want to recommend it only because I know it will make everyone who sees this film sad too.

1527303,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B0077ATSSQ,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a memorable film that moved me greatly. On the surface the story uses the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks to advance the story but the film is much more about coping with the loss of a loved one; and it's all beautifully done. The acting was incredibly good; I was amazed at how brilliantly young Thomas Horn essentially carries the entire movie being supported by some of the best actors today--Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow, Zoe Caldwell, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright and others! The cinematography and choreography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film quite a bit.We first see how Thomas Schell, a jeweler (Tom Hanks) loves to play with his son Oskar (Thomas Horn), a troubled kid who might have Asperger's Syndrome (at one point Oskar says his test results for Asperger's were inconclusive). Thomas plays with Oskar so that Oskar can build self-confidence and get over his fears which are many--including swing sets! In particular, Oskar likes to go on scavenger hunts that his father Thomas sets up for him; there's even one scavenger hunt to find the fictional sixth borough of New York City that turns out to be extremely meaningful. Tragically, Thomas is killed on September 11th in the attacks on The World Trade Center. This leaves vulnerable young Oskar tormented and his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) doesn't know what to do to make her son happy again as she herself looks for ways to cope with life without her husband.One year later, Oskar goes through his father's closet and accidentally breaks a blue vase; inside the vase is a key is in a small manila envelope and the work ""Black"" is written on the envelope. Oskar thinks this may be one last way he can re-connect with his father; perhaps his father was going to send him on a scavenger hunt mission to find something somewhere and that the word ""Black"" was the only clue. Oskar starts by finding every person with the last name of ""Black"" in the five boroughs of New York City; this is a formidable challenge. Oskar tries to systematically find all the ""Blacks"" with fascinating results.Now of course many people will comment on how young Oskar is allowed by his mother to simply roam the streets unaccompanied until a mysterious elderly man (Max von Sydow) who rents a room from his grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) helps Oskar search; this is understandable because it simply isn't very believable. It's also hard to understand how such a young boy could walk (Oskar's afraid of subway trains) from Manhattan to Brooklyn and be the only person walking on a major bridge walkway.However, if you can look past these implausible parts of the plot, this is one powerful film and I won't tell you much more to avoid giving you spoilers! I left out some of the plot already and there's plenty more you will discover for yourself. Rest assured that the last half-hour of the film is unbelievably poignant; it's enough to make a stone cry!Look for more great performances by John Goodman as Stan the doorman; Hazelle Goodman as Hazel Black and cameos by Jim Norton as ""Old Mr. Black"" and Lola Pashalinski as Mona Black.Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close explores loss; coping with the loss of a very dear loved one and even forgiveness. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and anyone who appreciates emotional, heartfelt dramas will want to add this to their collections.",4,"+ 1/2 star: riveting, emotional, heartfelt and memorable",1353024000,"11 16, 2012",2012,3440,"['Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'memorable', 'film', 'moved', 'greatly', 'surface', 'story', 'September', '11th', '2001', 'terrorist', 'attacks', 'advance', 'story', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'coping', 'loss', 'loved', 'one', 'beautifully', 'done', 'acting', 'was', 'incredibly', 'good', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'brilliantly', 'young', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'essentially', 'entire', 'movie', 'being', 'supported', 'best', 'actors', 'today', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Zoe', 'Caldwell', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'others', 'cinematography', 'choreography', 'reflect', 'great', 'forethought', 'musical', 'score', 'film', 'quite', 'bit.We', 'first', 'see', 'how', 'Thomas', 'Schell', 'jeweler', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'play', 'son', 'Oskar', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'troubled', 'kid', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'one', 'point', 'Oskar', 'test', 'results', 'Asperger', 'were', 'inconclusive', 'Thomas', 'Oskar', 'Oskar', 'can', 'build', 'self-confidence', 'get', 'fears', 'are', 'many', 'including', 'swing', 'sets', 'particular', 'Oskar', 'go', 'scavenger', 'hunts', 'father', 'Thomas', 'up', 'even', 'one', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'find', 'fictional', 'sixth', 'borough', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'out', 'be', 'extremely', 'meaningful', 'Tragically', 'Thomas', 'killed', 'September', '11th', 'attacks', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'vulnerable', 'young', 'Oskar', 'tormented', 'mother', 'Linda', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'make', 'son', 'happy', 'again', 'ways', 'cope', 'life', 'husband.One', 'year', 'later', 'Oskar', 'father', 'closet', 'accidentally', 'breaks', 'blue', 'vase', 'vase', 'key', 'small', 'manila', 'envelope', 'work', 'Black', 'written', 'envelope', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'last', 'way', 'can', 're-connect', 'father', 'perhaps', 'father', 'was', 'going', 'send', 'scavenger', 'hunt', 'mission', 'find', 'something', 'somewhere', 'word', 'Black', 'was', 'only', 'clue', 'starts', 'finding', 'person', 'last', 'name', 'Black', 'five', 'boroughs', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'formidable', 'challenge', 'Oskar', 'systematically', 'find', 'Blacks', 'fascinating', 'results.Now', 'course', 'many', 'people', 'will', 'comment', 'how', 'young', 'Oskar', 'allowed', 'mother', 'simply', 'roam', 'streets', 'unaccompanied', 'mysterious', 'elderly', 'man', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'room', 'grandmother', 'Zoe', 'Caldwell', 'Oskar', 'search', 'understandable', 'simply', ""n't"", 'very', 'believable', 'also', 'hard', 'understand', 'how', 'such', 'young', 'boy', 'could', 'walk', 'Oskar', 'afraid', 'subway', 'trains', 'Manhattan', 'Brooklyn', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'walking', 'major', 'bridge', 'walkway.However', 'can', 'look', 'implausible', 'parts', 'plot', 'one', 'powerful', 'film', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'much', 'more', 'avoid', 'giving', 'spoilers', 'left', 'out', 'plot', 'already', 'plenty', 'more', 'will', 'discover', 'Rest', 'assured', 'last', 'half-hour', 'film', 'unbelievably', 'poignant', 'enough', 'make', 'stone', 'cry', 'Look', 'more', 'great', 'performances', 'John', 'Goodman', 'Stan', 'doorman', 'Hazelle', 'Goodman', 'Hazel', 'Black', 'cameos', 'Jim', 'Norton', 'Old', 'Mr.', 'Black', 'Lola', 'Pashalinski', 'Mona', 'Black.Incredibly', 'Loud', 'Extremely', 'Close', 'explores', 'loss', 'coping', 'loss', 'very', 'dear', 'loved', 'one', 'even', 'forgiveness', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'actors', 'anyone', 'who', 'emotional', 'heartfelt', 'dramas', 'will', 'want', 'add', 'collections']",N/A

There's some subtle and not so subtle archetypes being used in this tale which almost remind me of a subdued fairy tale minus ""the happy happy people"". It's a bit slow but picks up once we flashback to the last few calls from the father and later on when a mysterious elderly man ends up being his partner in solving the mystery.Hard role to play by a kid (Thomas Horn) who seemed borderline autistic. I was also very impressed with the elderly man (whose character could ""not"" speak) role played by Max von Sydow who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Academy Awards. John Goodman has a small role in this picture as Stan the Doorman.Based on a novel of a similar title by by Jonathan Safran Foer. It was also nominated for Best Picture by the Academy Awards. Strangely, the Golden Globes didn't nominate it for anything.The budget for this picture was $40M and it made a bit over $47M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B to B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; 911 FOCUSES: B to B plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: B; WHEN WATCHED: May 2012;OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.BEST DIALOGUE (SPOILERS): Oskar Schell: If the sun were to explode, you wouldn't even know about it for 8 minutes because thats how long it takes for light to travel to us. Oskar Schell: For eight minutes the world would still be bright and it would still feel warm. Oskar Schell: It was a year since my dad died and I could feel my eight minutes with him... were running out.  /// Oskar Schell: I had to tell someone. I couldn't keep it a secret anymore. Oskar Schell: Can I tell you my story? The Renter: [the renter shows his hand that says 'yes' on it]  Oskar Schell: My father died at 9-11. After he died I wouldn't go into his room for a year because it was too hard and it made me want to cry. But one day, I put on heavy boots and went in his room anyway. I miss doing taekwondo with him because it always made me laugh. When I went into his closet, where his clothes and stuff were, I reached up to get his old camera. It spun around and dropped about a hundred stairs, and I broke a blue vase! Inside was a key in an envelope with black written on it and I knew that dad left something somewhere for me that the key opened and I had to find. So I take it to Walt, the locksmith. I give it to Stan, the doorman, who tells me keys can open anything. He gave me the phone book for all the five boroughs. I count there are 472 people with the last name black. There are 216 addresses. Some of the blacks live together, obviously. I calculated that if I go to 2 every Saturday plus holidays, minus my hamlet school plays, my minerals, coins, and comic convention, it's going to take me 3 years to go through all of them. But that's what I'm going to do! Go to every single person named black and find out what the key fits and see what dad needed me to find. I made the very best possible plan but using the last four digits of each phone number, I divide the people by zones. I had to tell my mother another lie, because she wouldn't understand how I need to go out and find what the key fits and help me make sense of things that don't even make sense like him being killed in the building by people that didn't even know him at all! And I see some people who don't speak English, who are hiding, one black said that she spoke to God. If she spoke to god how come she didn't tell him not to kill her son or not to let people fly planes into buildings and maybe she spoke to a different god than them! And I met a man who was a woman who a man who was a woman all at the same time and he didn't want to get hurt because he/she was scared that she/he was so different. And I still wonder if she/he ever beat up himself, but what does it matter?  Thomas Schell: What would this place be if everyone had the same haircut?  Oskar Schell: And I see Mr. Black who hasn't heard a sound in 24 years which I can understand because I miss dad's voice that much. Like when he would say, ""are you up yet?"" or...  Thomas Schell: Let's go do something.  Oskar Schell: And I see the twin brothers who paint together and there's a shed that has to be clue, but it's just a shed! Another black drew the same drawing of the same person over and over and over again! Forest black, the doorman, was a school teacher in Russia but now says his brain is dying! Seamus black who has a coin collection, but doesn't have enough money to eat everyday! You see olive black was a gate guard but didn't have the key to it which makes him feel like he's looking at a brick wall. And I feel like I'm looking at a brick wall because I tried the key in 148 different places, but the key didn't fit. And open anything it hasn't that dad needed me to find so I know that without him everything is going to be alright.  Thomas Schell: Let's leave it there then.  Oskar Schell: And I still feel scared every time I go into a strange place. I'm so scared I have to hold myself around my waist or I think I'll just break all apart! But I never forget what I heard him tell mom about the sixth borough. That if things were easy to find...  Thomas Schell: ...they wouldn't be worth finding.  Oskar Schell: And I'm so scared every time I leave home. Every time I hear a door open. And I don't know a single thing that I didn't know when I started! It's these times I miss my dad more than ever even if this whole thing is to stop missing him at all! It hurts too much. Sometimes I'm afraid I'll do something very bad. ///Linda Schell: It's never gonna make sense because it doesn't!",4,MY GRADE: B to B plus.,1343001600,"07 23, 2012",2012,5702,"['story', 'special',

Now I certainly don't agree with the Academy much of the time but still, they often get it right.  Oskar (a very good Thomas Horn) is a boy of about 12 who lost his father (Tom Hanks in flashbacks) in one of the towers on 9/11.  They were very close.  More so than with mom (Sandra Bullock).  Oskar is a strange young man, borderline autistic.  He admits that he was tested but the results were ""inconclusive.""  For sure he is odd.  One of those kids that gets picked on in school for wearing black socks and oxfords instead of Nikes.Oskar discovers a key inside a vase he accidently broke and believes that his dad wanted him to find the lock that matches.  The key is inside a small envelope with the word Black written on it.  This is a clue Oskar's father left for him he convinces himself, so he set out to find out where the key fits.  This is the first thing that is a bit puzzling.  The key is clearly one that fits a safety deposit box, but all the adults don't seem to see that.  So he tries it on numerous doors, padlocks and other locks in his search to find the right Mr. or Ms. Black.  Early on he traipses all across the boroughs of New York City, on foot!  Then he is escorted by an old man who is known as ""The Renter"" because he lives in a room let by Oskar's grandmother across the street.  The old man (Oscar nominee Max von Sydow) can't or won't speak.  But he writes clearly in bold letters on a note pad he carries.  Ultimately Oskar discovers where the key belongs, so what we have is the improbably journey.  Along the way, flashbacks of 9/11 and the associated guilt Oskar feels surfaces.The film is clearly sentimental and to some degree manipulates our emotions.  I don't find this terribly obtrusive, but Oskar's emotions are sometimes a bit much.  Still, reading some of the professional reviewers I find opinions all over the place.  Some even say they were offended.  Huh?  Is this Oscar-worthy in terms of Best Picture?  No.  Is this a sallow, bland, irritating, self-important film? No.  This is one of the most overly underrated films of the year and one of the most overly overrated at the same time.",3,3 1/2 stars for an unlikely post 9/11 journey,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",2012,2273,"['almost', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'getting', 'such', 'bad', 'press', 'most', 'critics', 'then', 'Oscar', 'think', 'something', 'there', 'Now', 'certainly', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Academy', 'much', 'time', 'still', 'often', 'get', 'right', 'Oskar', 'very', 'good', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'boy', '12', 'who', 'lost', 'father', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'flashbacks', 'one', 'towers', '9/11', 'were', 'very', 'close', 'More', 'so', 'mom', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Oskar', 'strange', 'young', 'man', 'borderline', 'autistic', 'was', 'tested', 'results', 'were', 'inconclusive', 'sure', 'odd', 'One', 'kids', 'picked', 'school', 'wearing', 'black', 'socks', 'oxfords', 'instead', 'Nikes.Oskar', 'key', 'vase', 'accidently', 'broke', 'dad', 'wanted', 'find', 'lock', 'key', 'small', 'envelope', 'word', 'Black', 'written', 'clue', 'Oskar', 'father', 'left', 'so', 'set', 'out', 'find', 'out', 'where', 'key', 'fits', 'first', 'thing', 'bit', 'puzzling', 'key', 'clearly', 'one', 'safety', 'deposit', 'box', 'adults', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'see', 'So', 'numerous', 'doors', 'padlocks', 'other', 'locks', 'search', 'find', 'right', 'Mr.', 'Ms.', 'Black', 'Early', 'boroughs', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'foot', 'Then', 'escorted', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'known', 'Renter', 'room', 'let', 'Oskar', 'grandmother', 'street', 'old', 'man', 'Oscar', 'nominee', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wo', ""n't"", 'speak', 'clearly', 'bold', 'letters', 'note', 'pad', 'Ultimately', 'Oskar', 'discovers', 'where', 'key', 'belongs', 'so', 'what', 'have', 'improbably', 'journey', 'way', 'flashbacks', '9/11', 'associated', 'guilt', 'Oskar', 'surfaces.The', 'film', 'clearly', 'sentimental', 'degree', 'emotions', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'terribly', 'obtrusive', 'Oskar', 'emotions', 'are', 'sometimes', 'bit', 'much', 'Still', 'reading', 'professional', 'reviewers', 'find', 'opinions', 'place', 'even', 'say', 'were', 'offended', 'Huh', 'Oscar-worthy', 'terms', 'Best', 'Picture', 'No', 'sallow', 'bland', 'irritating', 'self-important', 'film', 'No', 'one', 'most', 'overly', 'underrated', 'films', 'year', 'one', 'most', 'overly', 'overrated', 'same', 'time']",N/A

In fact it is the story of one boy, who must come to terms in his own unique way with the loss of his father.  The boy is a sensitive soul, and looks at the world with a unique set of eyes.. possibly he has Aspergers, but it is never made clear.  His relationship with his father (Tom Hanks, who has minimal screen time, but whose presence is nonetheless felt through much of the movie) was strong, with Hanks spending plenty of time with him, setting adventures for his son that would encourage him to interact with the outside world.  When 9-11 takes his dad's life, he sets off on a final quest, to find the lock that fits a key he has found in his dads things.First of all, it has to be said that Thomas Horn, playing the boy, carries the movie - he gives a quite extraordinary performance, which compels you to believe his world.  Without this performance the movie would be very slight indeed, relying somewhat on contrivance as it does.  Of course there are memorable supporting roles too.. notably Max von Sydow playing an elderly mute who shares an emotional bond with the boy.  These characters along the boys journey, combined with his performance, really make the journey worthwhile, as we see the boy learning that his loss is not the only loss in the world, that through the microcosm of the city he meets on his quest for the key, he understands more about what his father wanted for him, and makes emotional steps as well as figurative ones.There are times in the movie that the sense of grief is laid on just a little too thick, mostly in the scenes with Bullock as the boys mum and Hanks widow, to the point where I wondered if I really wanted to spend two hours in their company.  However as the movie ties up the loose ends (perhaps a little too neatly?) at the end, the final result is rewarding and poignant in a positive way.  It's almost a shame that the story does not leave a little more unanswered, as the result is moving, yes, at the time - but leaves little to ponder or to resonate in the days after you watch it, robbing this of classic status.  Having said that, however much I was aware how the movie was manipulating me, it actually did successfully push my buttons.  No movie can really encompass some magical coming to terms with something on the scale of 9-11, but viewed as a personal and introspective story, this actually works quite well.",4,Introspective drama benefits from fine performances,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",2012,2453,"['hinging', 'events', '9-11', 'not', 'movie', '9-11', 'fact', 'story', 'one', 'boy', 'who', 'must', 'come', 'terms', 'own', 'unique', 'way', 'loss', 'father', 'boy', 'sensitive', 'soul', 'world', 'unique', 'set', 'eyes..', 'possibly', 'Aspergers', 'never', 'made', 'clear', 'relationship', 'father', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'who', 'minimal', 'screen', 'time', 'presence', 'nonetheless', 'felt', 'much', 'movie', 'was', 'strong', 'Hanks', 'spending', 'plenty', 'time', 'setting', 'adventures', 'son', 'would', 'encourage', 'interact', 'outside', 'world', 'When', '9-11', 'dad', 'life', 'off', 'final', 'quest', 'find', 'lock', 'key', 'found', 'dads', 'things.First', 'be', 'said', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'playing', 'boy', 'movie', 'quite', 'extraordinary', 'performance', 'believe', 'world', 'performance', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'slight', 'indeed', 'relying', 'somewhat', 'contrivance', 'course', 'are', 'memorable', 'supporting', 'roles', 'too..', 'notably', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'playing', 'elderly', 'mute', 'who', 'shares', 'emotional', 'bond', 'boy', 'characters', 'boys', 'journey', 'combined', 'performance', 'really', 'make', 'journey', 'worthwhile', 'see', 'boy', 'learning', 'loss', 'not', 'only', 'loss', 'world', 'microcosm', 'city', 'quest', 'key', 'more', 'what', 'father', 'wanted', 'emotional', 'steps', 'as', 'well', 'figurative', 'are', 'times', 'movie', 'sense', 'grief', 'laid', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'thick', 'mostly', 'scenes', 'Bullock', 'boys', 'mum', 'Hanks', 'widow', 'point', 'where', 'wondered', 'really', 'wanted', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'company', 'However', 'movie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'neatly', 'end', 'final', 'result', 'rewarding', 'poignant', 'positive', 'way', 'almost', 'shame', 'story', 'not', 'leave', 'little', 'more', 'unanswered', 'result', 'moving', 'yes', 'time', 'little', 'ponder', 'resonate', 'days', 'watch', 'robbing', 'classic', 'status', 'Having', 'said', 'however', 'much', 'was', 'aware', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'manipulating', 'actually', 'did', 'successfully', 'push', 'buttons', 'movie', 'can', 'really', 'encompass', 'magical', 'coming', 'terms', 'something', 'scale', '9-11', 'viewed', 'personal', 'introspective', 'story', 'actually', 'quite', 'well']",N/A

I was pleasantly surprised.While the critics were fairly right about the slow, depressing and difficult film style, they left out that the movie is extremely realistic and very touching. It is not a big Hollywood movie that cost a lot to make or broke box office records. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was going more for a subtle emotional connection with its viewer.This is not a movie about 9-11. It is a incident which the movie revolves around, however over-all it is not the main point of the film. This movie is about the love and connection between a father and son and the need for that connection to last after someone has passed on.The directing is top notch and the movie has a very artsy-indie creative feel to it. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors and he does have a large role in this film as there are many flash backs.

If you're past the raging hormone stage of life, you'll find this immensely satisfying. Oskar, a bright boy with probable Aspergers, loses his father in the 9/11 attack.  He finds a key among his father's possessions and begins a quest to find the lock.  He's more than smart enough to invent a feasible plan, but he has no ability to handle the deep emotional scars left by his father's death.As great as this story is, this movie isn't about plot so much as it's about people and the way they treat each other.  The part of Oskar is taken by first-timer Thomas Horn, and I've never seen a better performance by a young person. He brings both vulnerability and the focused ability to irritate that so many Asperger's kids must learn to handle.  Every part, large or small, is perfectly cast.  From Sandra Bullock's distraught mother (with a surprise of her own) to John Goodman's doorman to Jeffrey Wright's estranged husband, this film is pitch-perfect.  It's impossible to watch without your own emotional response, but it doesn't feel manipulative.  With news crews finally moved on to the next tragedy, we're able to see the blow that 9/11 was to New Yorkers.  I couldn't help but think of the many families who are still dealing with the giant holes this left in their lives.Find a couple of quiet hours and watch this film through.

In all my years, I don't think I've ever seen something that deals with the loss of a parent in such an honest way. Yes, even though the bulk of the story kind of comes across like a fairy tale, the themes it deals with and how they are handled are some of the most realistic I've ever seen committed to film.I remember being excited to see this when it came out, and the wait was well worthwhile. Unlike another kind of similar tale about a youth's search for meaning in the midst of life's turmoils that I was excited to see when it came out, but ended up being disappointed with, ""Where The Wild Things Are"", I felt there was never a moment in this that wasn't just extremely brilliant and beautiful and moving.Being someone who lost my father a few years ago (he died unexpectedly of a heart attack), I relate to everything Oskar went through emotionally in this film, as I'm sure anyone else who's lost a parent will do. I felt this movie captured all the raw emotions and feelings that a person experiences after such a great loss, ranging from grief, anger, confusion, anger, feelings of euphoria from lack of sleep, anger, to even assessing blame on the surving parent.I was also very moved by the way the film dealt with generational themes, depicted beautifully between Oskar and the tenant in his grandmother's house (Max Von Sydow). The endurance of learning self respect and love and respect for others passed on from one generation to the next was so wonderfully depicted.Sorry, but I'm not going to go into plot scenarios here. If you want that, read someone else's review. I feel the plot has been disussed enough in so many other well written reviews. What I'm trying to share here is my experience and emotions while wathing the film. This is something that made me weep unabashedly, and I'm not ashamed to admit that. Yes, this is a deeply moving film, and even has some very depressing moments, but it is not an overall depressing film; and it also has some very magnificent enlightening moments, capturing the beautiful bonds of family relationships that will just take your breath away.And let me just say that the acting from the cast in this is some of the best I've ever seen from any of them. I honestly don't think I've ever seen better work from any of them before. Why the Academy didn't recognize their work in this is beyond me.As you can already probably guess, I HIGHLY recommend this movie!

1527341,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0077ATSSQ,Samuel McKewon,"[9, 12]","Skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and equally well-edited by Claire Simpson, ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" is about as good as it can be considering you spend two hours with two of the more annoying characters in recent memory. The first is 11-year-old Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) whose father died in 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. The second is Oskar's mute companion (Max Von Sydow), who answers questions by writing on paper, or flashing a ""yes"" or ""no"" tattooed on his palms. Together, they make a twee duo on a Journey for Truth. A Journey that's not really triggered by Oskar's dad but seems to be because the source novel, by Jonathan Safran Foer, needs some reason for the verbally-advanced-but-possibly-autistic Oskar to think he must walk the streets of New York City in search of a person named ""Black."" If the summary seems ridiculous, that's because the story is. Damn if it doesn't go down easier than it should, though. The book is unbearable. The movie isn't.Thomas Schell (Hanks) bonds best with persnickety  Oskar when he sends him on fictional quests in the city. Maps. Treasures. Clues. So, a year after Hanks' character dies, Oskar finds a key in a vase. And a name: ""Black."" Oskar fancies it as his father's last mission for him, and each Saturday he walks New York City rattling a tambourine for company, because his personality leaves him too scared for public transportation. Soon, a ""renter"" from his grandmother's apartment (Von Sydow) joins Oskar. He's tall and sad, with a secret out there in plain view. Folks tend to receive Oskar and this mute better than you might think for New Yorkers, and there's a reason for that, although it strains credulity just like the rest of the story.The Foer novel - and screenplay by Eric Roth - piles on props, symbols and emotional subplots. How does Oskar's mom (Sandra Bullock) manage her son's weekly disappearances?  Can Oskar come to terms with his final one-sided conversation with his dad over an answering machine? Does that key open any lock? Will the ""renter"" face up to his failures? While Roth wisely cuts out a lot of Foer's horsecrap - grandma's memory of French-kissing her sister has been redacted, thank God - if you scrutinize the details too closely, you'll find several don't hold up, especially Oskar's fixation with one of the leaping bodies from the World Trade Center.Oskar, the character, doesn't hold up. His level of organization - not to mention his acute antenna for adult emotions - are far too developed for a kid his age and supposed social struggles. He lapses into bizarre patterns of speech, talking without contractions, as if reciting a collegiate term paper. In one scene, he makes a calculated choice regarding the answering machine that's cruel beyond his comprehension; in another, he's making scrap book beyond his years as recompense for the initial cruelty he never acknowledges. Horn's voice quavers, breaks, bleats. He keeps his eyes wide in every scene. He's a smart, serious kid - he won's Jeopardy's Kids Week competition, which indirectly led to this role -  and that works against him here.Von Sydow, an Academy Award nominee for this performance, does a lot with pauses, shuffles and facial expressions to make up for the lack of dialogue. It's excellent acting for a shaggy dog of a character. Hanks has a small role depicting what amounts to a saint. Bullock's out of her depth, but that's no sea change. Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright are a weary, estranged couple, careful in their performances.Daldry (""The Hours"" and ""The Reader"") took plenty of shots from critics for his ""exploitative"" direction; that's code, at least in this case, for effective work. Whereas the book dawdles and tumbles into nonsense, the movie clips along. Daldry's big on fast-moving montages and matching images from scene to scene, and if you're trying to convey connectivity, there are worse proclivities to have. I disagree with his choice of title sequence and the movie's final image - which is a stark juxtaposition - but that's what the book gives him. It's bad there. It's bad here. In between is a polished, effective piece of emotional snookery, anchored by a lead character you'll love or hate. It doesn't work on me - Oskar's a bridge too far, and the novel is odious - but it will work on some.",2,The book is unbearable.

Not the most perfect movie ever made, but certainly watchable and moves along at a rapid pace. Newcomer child-actor Thomas Horn did a fantastic job of acting as he had to run the gamut of heavy emotions, he being beset with a huge guilt that he has not the age experience to deal with, hence his tantrums and minor transgressions. Horn should have been nominated for an Academy Award. His explosionn of emotion towards Von Sydow's character of what he was trying to accomplish was the best scene in the movie and great acting by Horn. I predict a big future for him.  I'm not familiar with Foer's books, but found this story credible and I'd see this movie twice (unlike the sucky, sappy ""War Horse"" I saw only a month before.)Great cinematography, a beautiful scene was of the NY sidewalk at night with everyone posting pictures of missing loved ones. The quiet dignity of those courageous survivors and I think I could actually feel the heat of the lit candles under the pictures. I felt as if I was there. Hanks and Bullock  barely have any screen time, but the job got done just the same.For adults looking for some adult drama with all the adult perks (no superheroes, comic book, fairy tale or teen-aged vampire characters), this is a great way to spend an afternoon.P.S.

1527347,A2VM2PGEJQ7FSW,B0077ATSSQ,Scott W. Bryant,"[1, 1]","There is an old adage that tells us that a recipe can only be as good as the ingredients that are used.  If that is true, consider the Oscar-nominated Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. It begins with director Stephen Daldry, a man so narratively gifted that all three of his previous films have gone on to earn ""Best Picture"" nominations.  To that, you add the two-time, Academy Award-winning actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of a saintly father who may be the only person on earth who understands his uniquely challenged son.  Now mix in Sandra Bullock, just two years removed from her own Oscar-winning performance, as a bereaved mother left to deal with her own grief, even as she struggles to help her son come to grips with his loss.  Finally, take all these ingredients and set them in the context of the ""jumpers"" leaping from the burning towers on September 11th.  What should emerge from the oven is a scintillating film that finally gives voice to our collective grief and rage.  But, unfortunately, this is not the case.  Indeed, there are two critical weaknesses that take the legs right out from underneath this film and ultimately prevent it from becoming anything more than an overly-saccharine sympathy card that leaves nothing but a bad aftertaste in your mouth.So what are the issues?  Well, the first problem has to do with the adaptation of the source material itself.  In fairness to Eric Roth, anytime a screenwriter has to distill the content of a novel down to a script that can be filmed in two hours, material is going to be sacrificed.  But in this case, many of Jonathan Safran Foer's most insightful musings on the nature of war and terror have been left on the editing room floor.  In the novel, the only reason the grandfather re-emerges into the life of this scarred young boy is because he, too, knows what it means to lose a parent to the ever-turning gears of war.  But here, in the film, the fire-bombings of Dresden during World War II are used only as a set up to explain the grandfather's selectively mute nature.  Thus, the larger theme of war and its impact on the lives of the innocent is almost completely absent.  And that is a very real problem when you are attempting to say something of value on the subject of 9/11. If you do ultimately decide to see this film, ask yourself this: how would the film have been substantially changed if Oskar's father did not die in the attacks of 9/11, but in a random car accident that left him with just enough time to place a few phone calls?  If you believe, as I do, that nothing would have functionally changed, than you will begin to see the central problem with the film.  To reduce the events of September 11th to nothing more than a plot device that allows a character to grow is to fundamentally disrespect the nearly 3000 people that lost their lives on that day in history.The second major issue with this film has to do with the casting of young Thomas Horn.  For some inexplicable reason, director Stephen Daldry made the decision to cast a complete unknown in the role of Oskar Schell.  Prior to this film, Horn had never acted either in film or in television; and that is a massive liability for a film in which the young actor is required to play an emotionally shattered boy who is likely suffering from the effects of Asperger's Syndrome as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  Yes, every once in a while, a Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense comes along to take us all by surprise.  But that is the exception and not the rule.So where does Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close sit in the pantheon of 9/11 films?  Probably somewhere beneath Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, and just above Adam Sandler's Reign Over Me.  At best, it's an adequate film that leaves the viewer wondering: is it just too soon to expect a film to really be able to handle the events of that day?Further reviews can be found at bloodstainedink.wordpress.com.",3,Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close:  A One-Minute Film Review,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",2013,3943,"['old', 'adage', 'recipe', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'ingredients', 'are', 'used', 'true', 'consider', 'Oscar-nominated', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'man', 'so', 'narratively', 'gifted', 'three', 'previous', 'films', 'have', 'gone', 'earn', 'Best', 'Picture', 'nominations', 'add', 'two-time', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'actor', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'role', 'saintly', 'father', 'who', 'may', 'be', 'only', 'person', 'earth', 'who', 'uniquely', 'challenged', 'son', 'Now', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'just', 'two', 'years', 'removed', 'own', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'bereaved', 'mother', 'left', 'deal', 'own', 'grief', 'even', 'help', 'son', 'come', 'grips', 'loss', 'Finally', 'take', 'ingredients', 'set', 'context', 'jumpers', 'leaping', 'burning', 'towers', 'September', '11th', 'What', 'should', 'emerge', 'oven', 'scintillating', 'film', 'finally', 'voice', 'collective', 'grief', 'rage', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'case', 'Indeed', 'are', 'two', 'critical', 'weaknesses', 'take', 'legs', 'right', 'out', 'underneath', 'film', 'ultimately', 'prevent', 'becoming', 'anything', 'more', 'overly-saccharine', 'sympathy', 'card', 'nothing', 'bad', 'aftertaste', 'mouth.So', 'what', 'are', 'issues', 'Well', 'first', 'problem', 'do', 'adaptation', 'source', 'material', 'fairness', 'Eric', 'Roth', 'anytime', 'screenwriter', 'distill', 'content', 'novel', 'down', 'script', 'can', 'be', 'filmed', 'two', 'hours', 'material', 'going', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'case', 'many', 'Jonathan', 'Safran', 'Foer', 'most', 'insightful', 'musings', 'nature', 'war', 'terror', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'editing', 'room', 'floor', 'novel', 'only', 'reason', 'grandfather', 'life', 'scarred', 'young', 'boy', 'too', 'what', 'lose', 'parent', 'ever-turning', 'gears', 'war', 'here', 'film', 'fire-bombings', 'Dresden', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'are', 'used', 'only', 'set', 'up', 'explain', 'grandfather', 'selectively', 'mute', 'nature', 'Thus', 'larger', 'theme', 'war', 'impact', 'lives', 'innocent', 'almost', 'completely', 'absent', 'very', 'real', 'problem', 'when', 'are', 'attempting', 'say', 'something', 'value', 'subject', '9/11', 'do', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'see', 'film', 'ask', 'how', 'would', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'substantially', 'changed', 'Oskar', 'father', 'did', 'not', 'die', 'attacks', '9/11', 'random', 'car', 'accident', 'left', 'just', 'enough', 'time', 'place', 'few', 'phone', 'calls', 'believe', 'do', 'nothing', 'would', 'have', 'functionally', 'changed', 'will', 'begin', 'see', 'central', 'problem', 'film', 'reduce', 'events', 'September', '11th', 'nothing', 'more', 'plot', 'device', 'character', 'grow', 'fundamentally', 'disrespect', 'nearly', '3000', 'people', 'lost', 'lives', 'day', 'history.The', 'second', 'major', 'issue', 'film', 'do', 'casting', 'young', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'made', 'decision', 'cast', 'complete', 'unknown', 'role', 'Oskar', 'Schell', 'Prior', 'film', 'Horn', 'had', 'never', 'acted', 'either', 'film', 'television', 'massive', 'liability', 'film', 'young', 'actor', 'required', 'play', 'emotionally', 'shattered', 'boy', 'who', 'likely', 'suffering', 'effects', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'as', 'well', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Disorder', 'Yes', 'once', 'while', 'Haley', 'Joel', 'Osment', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'along', 'take', 'surprise', 'exception', 'not', 'rule.So', 'where', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'sit', 'pantheon', '9/11', 'films', 'Probably', 'somewhere', 'beneath', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'just', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Reign', 'Me', 'best', 'adequate', 'film', 'viewer', 'wondering', 'just', 'too', 'soon', 'expect', 'film', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'handle', 'events', 'day', 'Further', 'reviews', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'bloodstainedink.wordpress.com']",N/A

I rented it thinking that Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are two talented actors who would be fun to watch.

The only thing we have in this meaningless universe are the relationships we have with each other.""  The boy's key was not important even though the boy wanted it to be something significant.  The search for knowledge makes you a better person, even if you know there is no hope of finding anything.  The father wanted his son to search for the sixth borough of New York even though he knew it never existed.  The boy would pick up some interesting trivia and talk to people along the way.  The old man knew that the search for the key's purpose was hopeless but went along for the ride anyway.  The encouraging message his father circled in a newspaper was a meaningless mistake from ink bleeding through the paper.  There is no reason to explain why terrorists would want to blow up a tower.  Nobody has answers to explain the world because there aren't any.  Anyone who claims to know is deceived or lying to you.  ""We know that there is no way to know anything with certainty.""This is a hopeless and dark way to live.  It also makes a painful 2 hours and 10 minutes to watch.

1527349,A3II7VQOJ0Q1XD,B0077ATSSQ,"Shannon L. Yarbrough ""Shannon L. Yarbrough""","[1, 1]","Earlier this year when I first started seeing this movie advertised I thought, ""Oh no! Not another 9/11 movie!""  The more I learned about it, I was curious.  After seeing it was based on a book, I had to read it.  The book was extremely frustrating at times, but incredibly rewarding by the end.I immediately warmed up to the kid, Oskar Schell, as a character. He's a cute little kid with a sense of humor, big heart, big imagination, one who asks too many questions. But as the central character, telling his story in first person, you have to remember how any real kid affected from 9/11 might react to losing a family member that day, how would they process it years later?Sure, Oskar's story is an adventure - both physical and emotional - as he finds a key that he believes is a clue left by his father and he goes in search of the lock it opens. But the real journey is Oskar seeking answers to questions, and in truth, trying to find out what those questions are.Oskar's adventure is the movie's focus as it should be.  In the book, he shares half the pages with the story of his grandparents. I found myself skimming through their sections anyway, so I was glad Hollywood did not spend much time there either. The story of Oskar's grandparents does play a crucial part in the film, but it remains a very minor plot line. This being said, I was very curious as to how the movie would end, and though it was completely different from the book I have to say I was well satisfied.The book has a lot of artistic value to it.

1527359,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B0077ATSSQ,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[9, 14]","In ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,"" 9-year-old Oskar (Thomas Horn) faces life without his father, Thomas Schell (Tom Hanks), who died in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, a time Oskar refers to as ""The Worst Day.""  Oskar happens upon an envelope among his father's possessions.  The envelope is labeled ""Black"" and inside is a key.  Oskar enjoyed the treasure hunt and riddle games his dad was always inventing for them, and figures this key might be one last game his dad left for him.  Surmising that Black is someone's name, Oskar determines to visit everyone in New York City with that name to find out what the key opens.A socially awkward kid who was tested for Asperger's syndrome, Oskar devises a methodical plan to visit each and every Black on his list, borough by borough, neighborhood by neighborhood.  Because he has psychological issues with the subway and buses, he sets out on foot to pursue his quest on foot during the weekends, carrying a tambourine to calm his nerves, as his mother (Sandra Bullock), caught up in her own grief, passively watches. Oskar is assisted in his journey by an elderly man (Max von Sydow), a mute who rents a room in his grandmother's (Zoe Caldwell) apartment.Tom Hanks appears briefly at the beginning of the film and intermittently later on in flashback to illustrate the strong bond between father and son.  The elder Schell was fond of creating mind problems and engaging Oskar to figure them out.  They would involve putting clues together and allowing Oskar to unravel them with minimal assistance.  With his father gone, a huge void is left in Oskar's life and he creates a kind of secret shrine to his dad, which includes the answering machine containing the last words spoken by his father on The Worst Day -- recordings even his mother hasn't heard.Young Mr. Horn is clearly the focus of the movie.  His Oskar is bright, determined, unconcerned with his own limitations, and consumed with his quest.  Because his Oskar is somewhat off -- not the typical kid you'll find next door -- it's tough to identify with him.  We feel for his loss on a non-emotional level because it's what anyone would feel about a kid who's lost his dad.  This is not to disparage Mr. Horn, who delivers what is asked of him.  But because his Oskar skews from the norm, he has some resistance to overcome to get the audience engaged.Mr. Horn is not terrific at eliciting instant empathy.  Because he doesn't approach his grief in traditional fashion -- crying, moodiness, withdrawal -- he is an oddity.  This creates an emotional distance between character and viewer.  We are interested up to a point, but then start wondering.  Shouldn't this kid be in therapy?  Is it safe for a young boy to be traveling the boroughs alone?  Isn't it the responsibility of an adult in his life to explain the folly of his goal and keep him safe?Director Stephen Daldry and writer Eric Roth have put together an excessively sentimental tale about loss, healing, and acceptance with little attempt at subtlety or restraint.  Under Daldry's direction, Mr. Horn must carry the picture, and though he gives it a Herculean try, he can't salvage a flawed script.There are several additional problems.  First, many of the characters remain sketchy.  Oskar's mom, his grandmother, a certain Mr. and Mrs. Black (Jeffrey Wright, Viola Davis) and especially the elderly renter are curiously underdeveloped.  Because the relationship Oskar forms with the elderly man is the boy's first real bond with another human being since the death of his father, it approaches poignancy, but Daldry simply uses the character as an interesting footnote rather than as someone who has a lasting effect on the youngster and his search for the impossible.Jonathan Safran Foer, the author of the novel on which the film is based, incorporated information about the effect of the Allied bombings of the German city of Dresden on the Schell family and contained ruminations on terrorism, war, and personal lives thrown into chaos by politics.  These are absent from the movie, leaving it more about communal healing than about national trauma but not making us feel an emotional investment in its characters.Sentiment is fine in a Lassie movie or in measured doses in mainstream films.  What feels wrong in ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is its obvious manipulation.  Director Daldry uses a child in an emotional tailspin in a blatant attempt to win our hearts but keeps us at arm's length, never quite succeeding in embracing us.  We start as spectators and remain so.The film has a rambling nature until the elderly renter joins Oskar in his trek around the city.  There is great chemistry between the two, and von Sydow's exceptional performance elevates the movie considerably.Rated PG-13, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" plays as a mystery predicated upon a young boy's desperation to solve his father's unintended final riddle.  As a picture about grief, it shows that the loss of a loved one takes different tolls on different people and each bereaved person must get over it in his own way.  Actual images of the 9/11 tragedy are fleeting, fortunately, and serve mostly to express the horror of the day. Ultimately, the movie never fully involves the viewer.  The fine performances far surpass the caliber of the script.",2,The Aftermath of a Cataclysmic Event,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,5341,"['Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', '9-year-old',

Oskar (Horn) is having a hard time dealing with the loss of his father (Hanks). On the morning of September 11th he is sent home early from school and is the first one home. He listens to the answering machine messages that he hides from his mother (Bullock). One year later he finds a key in his father's closer and finds one more way to be close to his dad. Going in I was looking forward to this one. Tom Hanks usually doesn't make a bad movie. While this is in no way a bad movie it was much slower then I expected. This was as depressing as I thought but there was something missing to really drive it home. Much like ""In The Land Of Blood & Honey"" it seemed to try to hard to make you feel bad when just the story alone has the power to do that. The one huge bright spot is the acting by the kid playing Oskar, he is in about 95% of the scenes and carries the movie extremely well. For a kid that young to steal a movie from Hanks is very impressive. Overall, a very good movie but I was expecting it to be better.

Oskar is an extraordinary child who has some very particular social quirks. His list is rather extensive and it's revealed that he was once tested for Asperger's Syndrome. However, Thomas Schell spends a great amount of time with his son and does everything he can to help him overcome his fears. However, on September 11, 2001 as the world changes forever, tragically so does the life of Oskar and his mother, Linda (Sandra Bullock), as Thomas was in the second tower of the World Trade Center when it fell. Linda attempts to move on with life, but Oskar refuses to move forward. A year later, he accidently destroys a blue vase while rummaging through his father's closet and discovers a key in an envelope simply marked ""Black"". Thomas constantly played games with Oskar and led him on journeys around the city, hiding clues and prizes in the most unexpected places. Oskar is convinced the key is a gift left behind by his father to send him on one last adventure. Determined to find the door the key unlocks, Oskar begins a systematic search of the city, trying to locate the person with the last name ""Black"" who will be able to help him solve the mystery. Along the way, Oskar becomes acquainted with a man his grandmother has been renting a room to. The man seems to have no name and is simply known as ""The Renter"" (Max Von Sydow). The Renter is a survivor of WWII and reminds Oskar of his father. The two become unlikely companions and friends as they search the city to unravel the mystery of the key.EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is based upon a 2005 novel by Jonathan Foer. I've not read the novel, so I can't compare the movie to the book.The movie is an extremely moving piece of cinema. It goes to places that the audience might not suspect. The movie has a satisfying ending, but it's not necessarily a happy one. Like life, Oskar's journey doesn't turn out exactly as he had hoped. However, like all journeys, it changes his life forever.The acting in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is amazing. Tom Hanks plays a small, but important role. Newcomer Thomas Horn is so powerful that it's difficult to believe this is the first time he's ever acted on film before. Sandra Bullock has a strong supporting role that is worthy of a Best Supporting Actress nomination. Max Von Sydow speaks no lines, but his eyes speak more and convey more emotion than the most well trained politician. John Goodman has what is basically a cameo as Stan the Doorman, but it's always a joy to watch Goodman perform, even in a role such as this. There are numerous smaller roles in the various Blacks that Oskar meets. Most of these characters are only on screen for a few brief moments but each of them ground their scenes in realism. EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a good movie that is made great by the acting performances. If for no other reason, it's worth watching for the acting alone.EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a very emotional movie. For Americans, particularly those who lived and worked in New York on September 11, 2001, it will probably have a different kind of reaction. However, though the story is told through the lens of September 11th, the film is really a story about a young man coming to grips with the unexpected death of his father. It's a film that will probably resonate with anyone who has lost a parent they were close to. I cried several times and the film really made me think about my own Dad and his untimely death. I left the theatre thinking about many of the memories I have of my Dad. It made me a little sad, but very grateful. In the future, I'm sure that EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE is a movie I'll watch whenever I'm sad and thinking about my Dad because I know that though it might cause a few tears, it'll cheer me up in the end and, like Thomas Schell and my own father, encourage me to not stop looking for whatever adventure life holds.",5,A Different Coming of Age Story,1333324800,"04 2, 2012",2012,4023,"['Oskar', 'Schell', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'shares', 'incredibly', 'close', 'relationship', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Schell', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'Oskar', 'extraordinary', 'child', 'who', 'very', 'particular', 'social', 'quirks', 'list', 'rather', 'extensive', 'revealed', 'was', 'once', 'tested', 'Asperger', 'Syndrome', 'However', 'Thomas', 'Schell', 'great', 'amount', 'time', 'son', 'everything', 'can', 'help', 'overcome', 'fears', 'However', 'September', '11', '2001', 'world', 'forever', 'tragically', 'so', 'life', 'Oskar', 'mother', 'Linda', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Thomas', 'was', 'second', 'tower', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'when', 'fell', 'Linda', 'move', 'life', 'Oskar', 'move', 'forward', 'year', 'later', 'accidently', 'blue', 'vase', 'rummaging', 'father', 'closet', 'key', 'envelope', 'simply', 'marked', 'Black', 'Thomas', 'constantly', 'played', 'games', 'Oskar', 'led', 'journeys', 'city', 'hiding', 'clues', 'prizes', 'most', 'unexpected', 'places', 'Oskar', 'convinced', 'key', 'gift', 'left', 'behind', 'father', 'send', 'one', 'last', 'adventure', 'Determined', 'find', 'door', 'key', 'unlocks', 'Oskar', 'systematic', 'search', 'city', 'trying', 'locate', 'person', 'last', 'name', 'Black', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'solve', 'mystery', 'way', 'Oskar', 'acquainted', 'man', 'grandmother', 'been', 'renting', 'room', 'man', 'have', 'name', 'simply', 'known', 'Renter', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'Renter', 'survivor', 'WWII', 'Oskar', 'father', 'two', 'become', 'unlikely', 'companions', 'friends', 'search', 'city', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'key.EXTREMELY', 'LOUD', 'AND', 'INCREDIBLY', 'CLOSE', 'based', '2005', 'novel', 'Jonathan', 'Foer', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'movie', 'book.The', 'movie', 'extremely', 'moving', 'piece', 'cinema', 'places', 'audience', 'might', 'not', 'suspect', 'movie', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'not', 'necessarily', 'happy', 'one', 'life', 'Oskar', 'journey', ""n't"", 'turn', 'out', 'exactly', 'had', 'hoped', 'However', 'journeys', 'life', 'forever.The', 'acting', 'EXTREMELY', 'LOUD', 'AND', 'INCREDIBLY', 'CLOSE', 'amazing', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'small', 'important', 'role', 'Newcomer', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'so', 'powerful', 'difficult', 'believe', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'acted', 'film', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'strong', 'supporting', 'role', 'worthy', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'lines', 'eyes', 'speak', 'more', 'convey', 'more', 'emotion', 'most', 'well', 'trained', 'politician', 'John', 'Goodman', 'what', 'basically', 'cameo', 'Stan', 'Doorman', 'always', 'joy', 'watch', 'Goodman', 'perform', 'even', 'role', 'such', 'are', 'numerous', 'smaller', 'roles', 'various', 'Blacks', 'Oskar', 'meets', 'Most', 'characters', 'are', 'only', 'screen', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'ground', 'scenes', 'realism', 'EXTREMELY', 'LOUD', 'AND', 'INCREDIBLY', 'CLOSE', 'good', 'movie', 'made', 'great', 'acting', 'performances', 'other', 'reason', 'worth', 'watching', 'acting', 'alone.EXTREMELY', 'LOUD', 'AND', 'INCREDIBLY', 'CLOSE', 'very', 'emotional', 'movie', 'Americans', 'particularly', 'who', 'lived', 'worked', 'New', 'York', 'September', '11', '2001', 'will', 'probably', 'have', 'different', 'kind', 'reaction', 'However', 'story', 'told', 'lens', 'September', '11th', 'film', 'really', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'coming', 'grips', 'unexpected', 'death', 'father', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'resonate', 'anyone', 'who', 'lost', 'parent', 'were', 'close', 'cried', 'several', 'times', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'think', 'own', 'Dad', 'untimely', 'death', 'left', 'theatre', 'thinking', 'many', 'memories', 'have', 'Dad', 'made', 'little', 'sad', 'very', 'grateful', 'future', ""'m"", 'sure', 'EXTREMELY', 'LOUD', 'AND', 'INCREDIBLY', 'CLOSE', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'whenever', ""'m"", 'sad', 'thinking', 'Dad', 'know', 'might', 'cause', 'few', 'tears', ""'ll"", 'cheer', 'up', 'end', 'Thomas', 'Schell', 'own', 'father', 'encourage', 'not', 'stop', 'looking', 'adventure', 'life']",N/A

However, if you are entranced by emotions, adventure, and character development, this film will likely suck you in and not let go until the credits roll.For a basic plot summary, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" begins by showing the extraordinary loving relationship between Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) and his father Thomas (Tom Hanks). When Thomas is killed during the 9/11 attacks in New York City, little Oskar is devastated. In trying to re-connect with the presence of his father, Oskar finds a strange key in his father's closet and sets out on a quest to find out its meaning. Along the way, Oskar meets up with an older gentleman (played by Max von Sydow) who helps him along.The remarkable aspect of this film is how it sets up such an emotional bond between father and son in a matter of minutes. When Thomas is killed, you will feel a crushing sense of loss and as such root even harder for young Oskar to see through his epic quest. Even when the primary narrative may wane from time to time, the young boy's incredible love for his father will be what keeps you on the edge of your seat.The characters are also very well-acted in this movie. Horn carries the film in practically every scene, while Hanks is well, Hanks for the short time he is on screen. Sydow picks up a key role roughly half way through the movie, while Sandra Bullock (""Mom"" Schell) plays the grieving widower with great passion.This is a very down-to-earth film, as well. Nothing is over-the-top or overly dramatic. Without giving away any spoilers, I can say that the ending of the film may not initially gratify you, but once pondered upon will reveal itself as the right kind of conclusion for such a real-world effort.Overall, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" is likely to, at the very least, find you rooting on young Oskar Schell as step by step he gets closer to re-discovering his father. The experience will make you both think and feel long after the lights come up.",4,A Boy's Love For His Father,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2129,"['go', 'cinema', 'looking', 'pulse-pounding', 'action', 'over-the-top', 'antics', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'can', 'be', 'crossed', 'off', 'watch', 'list', 'However', 'are', 'entranced', 'emotions', 'adventure', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'will', 'likely', 'suck', 'not', 'let', 'go', 'credits', 'roll.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'showing', 'extraordinary', 'loving', 'relationship', 'Oskar', 'Schell', 'Thomas', 'Horn', 'father', 'Thomas', 'Tom', 'Hanks', 'When', 'Thomas', 'killed', '9/11', 'attacks', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'little', 'Oskar', 'devastated', 'trying', 're-connect', 'presence', 'father', 'Oskar', 'strange', 'key', 'father', 'closet', 'out', 'quest', 'find', 'out', 'meaning', 'way', 'Oskar', 'up', 'older', 'gentleman', 'played', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'who', 'along.The', 'remarkable', 'aspect', 'film', 'how', 'up', 'such', 'emotional', 'bond', 'father', 'son', 'matter', 'minutes', 'When', 'Thomas', 'killed', 'will', 'feel', 'crushing', 'sense', 'loss', 'such', 'root', 'even', 'harder', 'young', 'Oskar', 'see', 'epic', 'quest', 'Even', 'when', 'primary', 'narrative', 'may', 'wane', 'time', 'time', 'young', 'boy', 'incredible', 'love', 'father', 'will', 'be', 'what', 'edge', 'seat.The', 'characters', 'are', 'also', 'very', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'Horn', 'film', 'practically', 'scene', 'Hanks', 'well', 'Hanks', 'short', 'time', 'screen', 'Sydow', 'up', 'key', 'role', 'roughly', 'way', 'movie', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'Mom', 'Schell', 'grieving', 'widower', 'great', 'passion.This', 'very', 'down-to-earth', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Nothing', 'over-the-top', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'giving', 'away', 'spoilers', 'can', 'say', 'ending', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'initially', 'gratify', 'once', 'pondered', 'upon', 'will', 'reveal', 'right', 'kind', 'conclusion', 'such', 'real-world', 'effort.Overall', 'Extremely', 'Loud', 'Incredibly', 'Close', 'likely', 'very', 'least', 'find', 'rooting', 'young', 'Oskar', 'Schell', 'step', 'step', 'closer', 're-discovering', 'father', 'experience', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'feel', 'long', 'lights', 'come', 'up']",N/A
