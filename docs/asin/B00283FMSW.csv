If you are a teacher and you are giving Fairy Tales this is an incredible DVD for your course. Don't pay attention to light reviews from people who only watch Disney films. If you want three short cuts on Fairy Tales that you can interpret from a psychological perspective these are unique. I recommend the books: ""The Trails & Tribulations of Little Red Riding Hood"" by Zipes, ""The European Folktale"" by L&uuml;thi and ""The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales"" by Bruno Bettelheim. With these books you will see how great these little pieces are.",5,Excellent Short Films,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,678,"['really', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'know', 'who', 'was', 'Bruno', 'Bettelheim', 'great', 'material', 'are', 'teacher', 'are', 'giving', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'incredible', 'DVD', 'course', 'Do', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'light', 'reviews', 'people', 'who', 'only', 'watch', 'Disney', 'films', 'want', 'three', 'short', 'cuts', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'can', 'interpret', 'psychological', 'perspective', 'are', 'unique', 'recommend', 'books', 'Trails', 'Tribulations', 'Little', 'Red', 'Riding', 'Hood', 'Zipes', 'European', 'Folktale', 'L', 'uuml', 'thi', 'Uses', 'Enchantment', 'Meaning', 'Importance', 'Fairy', 'Tales', 'Bruno', 'Bettelheim', 'books', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'great', 'little', 'pieces', 'are']",N/A

Chirstina Ricci is very good in the title role and they tell the tale as is really was and NOT the sanitized version we grew up with,The other two films, Little Sucks-a-thumb and the Frog King are great and disturbing in their own right.

1255036,AQ9YM4TVI7PGS,B00283FMSW,James Johnston,"[0, 0]","this was exciting and beautifully told. it's excellent folklore as well as superior cinema. i guess i'm going to have to say i'm a little embarrassed by anyone that doesn't easily get this. it wasn't too difficult. it was art. and very well made and expressed with skill and confidence. this has to be my favorite version of the folk legend next to Neil Jordan's exquisite 'Company of the Wolves'.i also thought the other companion shorts were also exceptional filmmaking. 'The frog king' was just sublime and very sensual, but i think it was 'Little Suck-a-Thumb' that just floored me with it's wit and terrifying humourous allegory of maturity. i'm sure it would scare any kid with THAT problem. or anyone with a fixation of any sort. i laughed my head off but i'm sure i'll pay with some nightmares for life.this is a must for anyone who loves to explore folklore or even for those who like to see it all sent up farcically. but it still has a beautiful, eerie and mysterious weird quality to it's telling.i found it suitable for all audiences but that is only my opinion. and it's a progressive one. some families may not be comfortable with many of the sexual suggestion here. but that is all it is. suggestion. there is nothing overt and no nudity or heavy profanity. only a naughty word uttered by a puppet kitty cat. most sensible folks can handle this.",5,"Haunting, Insightful",1329436800,"02 17, 2012",2012,1361,"['was', 'exciting', 'beautifully', 'told', 'excellent', 'folklore', 'as', 'well', 'superior', 'cinema', 'i', 'guess', 'i', ""'m"", 'going', 'have', 'say', 'i', ""'m"", 'little', 'embarrassed', 'anyone', ""n't"", 'easily', 'get', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'difficult', 'was', 'art', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'expressed', 'skill', 'confidence', 'be', 'favorite', 'version', 'folk', 'legend', 'next', 'Neil', 'Jordan', 'exquisite', ""'Company"", ""Wolves'.i"", 'also', 'thought', 'other', 'companion', 'shorts', 'were', 'also', 'exceptional', 'filmmaking', 'frog', 'king', 'was', 'just', 'sublime', 'very', 'sensual', 'i', 'think', 'was', ""'Little"", 'Suck-a-Thumb', 'just', 'floored', 'wit', 'terrifying', 'humourous', 'allegory', 'maturity', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'scare', 'kid', 'problem', 'anyone', 'fixation', 'sort', 'i', 'laughed', 'head', 'i', ""'m"", 'sure', 'i', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'nightmares', 'life.this', 'must', 'anyone', 'who', 'explore', 'folklore', 'even', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'sent', 'up', 'farcically', 'still', 'beautiful', 'eerie', 'mysterious', 'weird', 'quality', 'telling.i', 'found', 'suitable', 'audiences', 'only', 'opinion', 'progressive', 'one', 'families', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'comfortable', 'many', 'sexual', 'suggestion', 'here', 'suggestion', 'nothing', 'overt', 'nudity', 'heavy', 'profanity', 'only', 'naughty', 'word', 'uttered', 'puppet', 'kitty', 'cat', 'most', 'sensible', 'folks', 'can', 'handle']",N/A
