The ""bad guys"" are over the top bad and the ""good guys"" are so sugar sweet that I felt like I needed some insulin.  It's supposedly in the mountains at Christmas time but they apparently used some back lot location for a show set in the summer because there are leaves on all of the trees and summer flowers are blooming all over the place.  THe characters don't even bother to pretend it's cold outside and in some scenes one character will be in a t-shirt while another will be in a coat and scarf.  And naturally the final scene has the prerequisite cheesy snowfall.  It's like a movie put together by a bunch of teenagers for a school project.There's two hours of my life I'll never get back!",1,One of the worst,1322092800,"11 24, 2011",2011,775,"['Predictable', 'plot', 'horrible', 'acting', 'totally', 'formulaic', 'total', 'waste', 'time', 'bad', 'guys', 'are', 'top', 'bad', 'good', 'guys', 'are', 'so', 'sugar', 'sweet', 'felt', 'needed', 'insulin', 'supposedly', 'mountains', 'Christmas', 'time', 'apparently', 'used', 'back', 'lot', 'location', 'show', 'set', 'summer', 'are', 'leaves', 'trees', 'summer', 'flowers', 'are', 'blooming', 'place', 'THe', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'pretend', 'cold', 'outside', 'scenes', 'one', 'character', 'will', 'be', 't-shirt', 'will', 'be', 'coat', 'scarf', 'naturally', 'final', 'scene', 'prerequisite', 'cheesy', 'snowfall', 'movie', 'put', 'together', 'bunch', 'teenagers', 'school', 'two', 'hours', 'life', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'back']",A Christmas Proposal
