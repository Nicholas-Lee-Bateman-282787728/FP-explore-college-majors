One day he discovers that one of his long lost relatives was the infamous Dr. Jekyll. When he tries the formula to try to perfect it, he unleashes his alter ego, Ms. Hyde. Now he must try to find a way to reverse the curse before its too late and she takes his body and his job.My ReviewI had seen this a while back on tv. Not completely in full, but most of the film. So recently i found the DVD at my local best buy for 5.99. I bought it with 2 other 5.99 dvds (being The Great White Hype, and The Adventures of Pinnochio). So today i watched it and i rediscovered why i enjoyed the movie so much. Its not a horror film, its a comedy. The acting i thought was pretty good and the effects while not the best were decent enough to get the job done. The young woman who plays Helen Hyde, actress Sean Young, is attractive and quite the evil lady. The movie starts as Jacks goes to a relative's will reading. He inherrits his great grandfather's scientifit journals. It is here that he discovers that he's not a Jacks at all, but a Jekyll.Jacks starts to study the formula closely and discovers that maybe certain things had to be upped before the formula could actually work. What he does is up the estrogine that's inside by 160%. What ends up happening is that its too much, and now instead of turning into an evil hyde man, he becomes a female. Now his life is thrown into chaos as he tries to keep his job going with the perfume place trying to make a new scent, keeping his love life together, and trying to get rid of Hyde. It only gets more difficult when Hyde herself tries to work up a scent and try to take over his life and his job. Funny things happen, and in the end the guy has the last laugh.Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde is rated PG-13 for slight nudity and sexual inuendo.DVD FeatursThis is the only bad thing about the dvd. THERE ARE NO FEATURES WHAT SO EVER! Not even a trailer! Its almost like a simple transfer of a widescreen VHS version of the movie onto a DVD-R.The bottom LineIf your into laughs and just want a good comedy, this one's for you. Just don't expect anything extra other than a decent widescreen transfer of the film.",4,Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde DVD Review,1100304000,"11 13, 2004",2004,2220,"['StoryDr', 'Jacks', 'perfume', 'scent', 'maker', 'also', 'scientist', 'One', 'day', 'one', 'long', 'lost', 'relatives', 'was', 'infamous', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'When', 'formula', 'try', 'perfect', 'alter', 'ego', 'Ms.', 'Hyde', 'Now', 'must', 'try', 'find', 'way', 'reverse', 'curse', 'too', 'late', 'body', 'job.My', 'ReviewI', 'had', 'seen', 'while', 'back', 'tv', 'Not', 'completely', 'full', 'most', 'film', 'So', 'recently', 'i', 'found', 'DVD', 'local', 'best', 'buy', '5.99', 'bought', '2', 'other', '5.99', 'dvds', 'being', 'Great', 'White', 'Hype', 'Adventures', 'Pinnochio', 'today', 'i', 'watched', 'i', 'rediscovered', 'why', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'not', 'horror', 'film', 'comedy', 'acting', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'effects', 'not', 'best', 'were', 'decent', 'enough', 'get', 'job', 'done', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'Helen', 'Hyde', 'actress', 'Sean', 'Young', 'attractive', 'evil', 'lady', 'movie', 'Jacks', 'relative', 'will', 'reading', 'great', 'grandfather', 'scientifit', 'journals', 'here', 'not', 'Jacks', 'Jekyll.Jacks', 'study', 'formula', 'closely', 'discovers', 'maybe', 'certain', 'things', 'had', 'be', 'upped', 'formula', 'could', 'actually', 'work', 'What', 'up', 'estrogine', 'inside', '160', '%', 'What', 'up', 'happening', 'too', 'much', 'now', 'instead', 'turning', 'evil', 'hyde', 'man', 'female', 'Now', 'life', 'thrown', 'chaos', 'keep', 'job', 'going', 'perfume', 'place', 'trying', 'make', 'new', 'scent', 'keeping', 'love', 'life', 'together', 'trying', 'get', 'rid', 'Hyde', 'only', 'more', 'difficult', 'when', 'Hyde', 'work', 'up', 'scent', 'try', 'take', 'over', 'life', 'job', 'Funny', 'things', 'happen', 'end', 'guy', 'last', 'laugh.Dr', 'Jekyll', 'Ms.', 'Hyde', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'slight', 'nudity', 'sexual', 'inuendo.DVD', 'FeatursThis', 'only', 'bad', 'thing', 'dvd', 'ARE', 'NO', 'FEATURES', 'WHAT', 'SO', 'EVER', 'Not', 'even', 'trailer', 'almost', 'simple', 'transfer', 'widescreen', 'VHS', 'version', 'movie', 'DVD-R.The', 'bottom', 'LineIf', 'laughs', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'comedy', 'one', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'extra', 'other', 'decent', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'film']",Dr Jekyll & Ms Hyde VHS
389498,AICC1R30KLRU8,6303926177,Anthony Trimarchi,"[1, 1]","This film reminds me of those old screwball comedy films of the 1930s. It has a plot, and sequels itself to the past Jekyll and Hyde films (as the main character is the grandson or something like that of Dr. Jekyll), and although it's not a ""spuff"" comedy in total it still is a screwballish comedy with a plot. It's a film that's not (nor ever) meant to be taken ultra serious or even serious for that matter, but even still again...it does have a outline plot story with a happier ending than the original Jekyll/Hyde. I seen this movie in the theaters (day showing) when it first hit theaters in August 1995 (as I was bored that day and it was extremely hot where I lived) a week before returning back to High School as summer break was concluding. It was a late summer flick that seem to be the type of movie you seen as a teenager or adult while bored one summer night or afternoon. Critics missed the mark on this film, and those who went in expecting a masterpiece or serious remake of the original film also missed its intentions. This film was meant to be nothing more than a fun, different, and comical twist to the endless remakes of Jekyll/Hyde film similar to what ""To Be or Not To Be"" (1942/1983) did with WWII or ""Naked Gun"" 1990's film series did. Although not meant to be a remake (but a sequel), nor an award winning film, nor to be taken overly serious this film was meant to be just what it is and that is a summer comedy fill in void. Thus is why this film was released in August of 1995 prior to kids returning to school and when most of the lightweight non-contending movies were in the era released. It succeeded in those areas. I found this movie entertaining, fun, and comical, and it gave a different/unique ""female"" twist to the age old Jekyll/Hyde story instead of just another word by word remake of the original. It's not plot less like some of the more comedies of the time, it does have a simple storyline, however go into this movie expecting nothing more than what it is (a screwball comedy summer fill in meant to pass time and gain a few laughs with a different modern plot twist on an age old story) than you'll enjoy this film. I give this film four out of five stars.",4,Dr Jekyll and Ms Hyde (1995),1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,2207,"['film', 'old', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'films', '1930s', 'plot', 'sequels', 'past', 'Jekyll', 'Hyde', 'films', 'main', 'character', 'grandson', 'something', 'Dr.', 'Jekyll', 'not', 'spuff', 'comedy', 'total', 'still', 'screwballish', 'comedy', 'plot', 'film', 'not', 'ever', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'ultra', 'serious', 'even', 'serious', 'matter', 'even', 'still', 'again', 'have', 'outline', 'plot', 'story', 'happier', 'ending', 'original', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'seen', 'movie', 'theaters', 'day', 'showing', 'when', 'first', 'hit', 'theaters', 'August', '1995', 'was', 'bored', 'day', 'was', 'extremely', 'hot', 'where', 'lived', 'week', 'returning', 'back', 'High', 'School', 'summer', 'break', 'was', 'concluding', 'was', 'late', 'summer', 'flick', 'seem', 'be', 'type', 'movie', 'seen', 'teenager', 'adult', 'bored', 'one', 'summer', 'night', 'afternoon', 'Critics', 'missed', 'mark', 'film', 'who', 'went', 'expecting', 'masterpiece', 'serious', 'remake', 'original', 'film', 'also', 'missed', 'intentions', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'fun', 'different', 'comical', 'twist', 'endless', 'remakes', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'film', 'similar', 'what', 'Be', 'Not', 'Be', '1942/1983', 'did', 'WWII', 'Naked', 'Gun', '1990', 'film', 'series', 'did', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'remake', 'sequel', 'award', 'winning', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'overly', 'serious', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'just', 'what', 'summer', 'comedy', 'fill', 'void', 'Thus', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'August', '1995', 'prior', 'kids', 'returning', 'school', 'when', 'most', 'lightweight', 'non-contending', 'movies', 'were', 'era', 'released', 'succeeded', 'areas', 'found', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'comical', 'gave', 'different/unique', 'female', 'twist', 'age', 'old', 'Jekyll/Hyde', 'story', 'instead', 'just', 'word', 'word', 'remake', 'original', 'not', 'plot', 'less', 'more', 'comedies', 'time', 'have', 'simple', 'storyline', 'however', 'go', 'movie', 'expecting', 'nothing', 'more', 'what', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'summer', 'fill', 'meant', 'pass', 'time', 'gain', 'few', 'laughs', 'different', 'modern', 'plot', 'twist', 'age', 'old', 'story', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'give', 'film', 'four', 'five', 'stars']",Dr Jekyll & Ms Hyde VHS
