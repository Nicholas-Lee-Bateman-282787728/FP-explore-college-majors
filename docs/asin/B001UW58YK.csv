1242462,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B001UW58YK,barry,"[62, 65]","Many opinions have been posted here on the release of this CAUGHT IN THE ACT blu ray.  Why reissue something we have already seen?  Why no new live material from Michael Buble?  These can be valid questions but I also agree that they also have nothing to do with the quality of this item.  I shall try to offer my perspective and hopefully it will help you decide whether you wish to purchase it.First off, I in no way think Michael Buble is milking his fans.  Blu ray is an amazing gift to film and video enthusiasts.  A good blu ray transfer is miles above even the highest quality dvd in picture quality and audio presentation.  Due to the brilliance of blu ray almost everything that sold well on dvd is being reissued on blu ray for it is such an improvement.  I doulble dipped here and was thrilled when I heard it was coming on blu ray.I have a high end blu ray player, a hd television and a high end receiver.  An hd television is really a must to be able to fully appreciate blu ray.  I found the picture quality stunning.  Colors are crisp, flesh tones are amazing and the clarity crystal clear.  When Michael is on stage you can see every line on his face, every drop of sweat.  He appears as if he is in your room with you, as if you are actually at the concert.  This is the reason for blu ray.I must admit at first with the audio i had a problem finding the best level to play it at.  I found the volume varied greatly from the audience clapping to Michael singing.  I was surprised for DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 is an excellent source.  But then I remembered my receiver had different audio settings for music recordings so I changed the audio to CONCERT and it greatly improved but when I changed it to JAZZ the sound bacame impeccable.  The sound level between Michael and the orchestra was perfection and audience participation stayed at a greatly enjoyable steady level.  He runs into the audience, uses lighting a lot in his show and the picture holds strong thru it all.The performance most Michal Buble fans will already know.  First off, the concert is 120 minutes and not the 90 minutes it says in the item description by Amazon.  This is a stellar concert with a wide range of superb song selections.  Michael Buble is in true form with his pure artistry in the forefront.  I have seen him live twice and watching this brings me back again.  The dvd never really did for me.  Michael is an amazing performer.  He puts so much into his stylings of his songs including his effective body movements and his camaraderie with the audience is a joy to watch.  He is funny, energetic, sincere, humble and a true gentleman.Bottom line, you know Michael Buble and you probably already know this concert.  If you love the concert and have the equipment to enjoy blu ray at its finest I recommend double dipping here.  When I watch it on my 37"" hd tv I am mezmerized and have no complaints.  I find this blu ray transfer a huge success.",5,Amazing blu ray transfer - a must have,1240617600,"04 25, 2009",2009,2948,"['Many', 'opinions', 'have', 'been', 'posted', 'here', 'release', 'CAUGHT', 'IN', 'THE', 'ACT', 'blu', 'ray', 'Why', 'reissue', 'something', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'Why', 'new', 'live', 'material', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'can', 'be', 'valid', 'questions', 'also', 'agree', 'also', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'quality', 'item', 'shall', 'try', 'offer', 'perspective', 'hopefully', 'will', 'help', 'decide', 'wish', 'purchase', 'it.First', 'off', 'way', 'think', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'milking', 'fans', 'Blu', 'ray', 'amazing', 'gift', 'film', 'video', 'enthusiasts', 'good', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'miles', 'above', 'even', 'highest', 'quality', 'dvd', 'picture', 'quality', 'audio', 'presentation', 'Due', 'brilliance', 'blu', 'ray', 'almost', 'everything', 'sold', 'well', 'dvd', 'being', 'reissued', 'blu', 'ray', 'such', 'improvement', 'doulble', 'dipped', 'here', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'coming', 'blu', 'ray.I', 'have', 'high', 'end', 'blu', 'ray', 'player', 'hd', 'television', 'high', 'end', 'receiver', 'hd', 'television', 'really', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'blu', 'ray', 'found', 'picture', 'quality', 'stunning', 'Colors', 'are', 'crisp', 'flesh', 'tones', 'are', 'amazing', 'clarity', 'crystal', 'clear', 'When', 'Michael', 'stage', 'can', 'see', 'line', 'face', 'drop', 'sweat', 'room', 'are', 'actually', 'concert', 'reason', 'blu', 'ray.I', 'must', 'admit', 'first', 'audio', 'i', 'had', 'problem', 'finding', 'best', 'level', 'play', 'found', 'volume', 'varied', 'greatly', 'audience', 'clapping', 'Michael', 'singing', 'was', 'surprised', 'DTS', 'HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'excellent', 'source', 'then', 'remembered', 'receiver', 'had', 'different', 'audio', 'settings', 'music', 'recordings', 'so', 'changed', 'audio', 'CONCERT', 'greatly', 'improved', 'when', 'changed', 'JAZZ', 'sound', 'bacame', 'impeccable', 'sound', 'level', 'Michael', 'orchestra', 'was', 'perfection', 'audience', 'participation', 'stayed', 'greatly', 'enjoyable', 'steady', 'level', 'audience', 'lighting', 'lot', 'show', 'picture', 'strong', 'thru', 'performance', 'most', 'Michal', 'Buble', 'fans', 'will', 'already', 'know', 'First', 'concert', '120', 'minutes', 'not', '90', 'minutes', 'item', 'description', 'Amazon', 'stellar', 'concert', 'wide', 'range', 'superb', 'song', 'selections', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'true', 'form', 'pure', 'artistry', 'forefront', 'have', 'seen', 'live', 'twice', 'watching', 'back', 'again', 'dvd', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'Michael', 'amazing', 'performer', 'so', 'much', 'stylings', 'songs', 'including', 'effective', 'body', 'movements', 'camaraderie', 'audience', 'joy', 'watch', 'funny', 'energetic', 'sincere', 'humble', 'true', 'gentleman.Bottom', 'line', 'know', 'Michael', 'Buble', 'probably', 'already', 'know', 'concert', 'love', 'concert', 'have', 'equipment', 'enjoy', 'blu', 'ray', 'finest', 'recommend', 'double', 'dipping', 'here', 'When', 'watch', '37', 'hd', 'tv', 'am', 'mezmerized', 'have', 'complaints', 'find', 'blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'huge', 'success']",N/A
