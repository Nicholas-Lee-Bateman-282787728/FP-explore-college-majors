292276,A38N4MOCLSOKOH,6302036054,Armando A. Gomez,"[5, 5]","The film, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is Jodie Foster's greatest performance of her acting career.  Her second greatest was ""Foxes.""  Other later works such as ""The Accused"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Contact"" were top notch but not her best.  These films were ""tailored"" for her, despite the fact that only Foster could have made these films the fantastic success that they are.  But not The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane.  Foster's character completely carries the film.Like Sol, the story, the scenes, the other characters revolves around her like planets.  The story itself is impossible, almost ridiculous but because of the artistry of the screenplay and the film's director the storyline was a resounding success.  To top if off the love story of the film is believable, sincere--even necessary! the best that Hollywood had to offer in a very long time.  Foster tried to (in my opinion) achieve the pinnacle of her acting ability in ""Nell"" but no go; the screenplay failed her.Upon the review of her acting career The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is without a doubt her greatest accomplishment.  Yes, it surpasses that ""junk"" known as ""Taxi Driver.""  Foster's character in that film was nothing more than a one ""trick"" pony.  The hoopla and hype of her ""performance"" was due to her being ""cast"" as a teen hooker, nothing more.  There was talk about a ""nude scene"" of Jodie in TLGWLDTL which was edited during its theatrical release in 1976.  But when I first saw it that whole nude scene was already cut out because Foster was 13 years old.  The mainstream media back then reported that the scene was destroyed.  Imagined my surprise after purchasing and then viewing the DVD version that those scenes were not destroyed at all but completely restored.  But for you pedophiles: tough nuggies.  Foster's body-doubling sister who did the nude scene was over 18 years old.  I do have one objection: this movie is rated PG. It should be rated R.Oh, one more thing: I resent the publicity of this film as a ""horror"" movie.  It-is-not-a-horror-movie.  It's a suspense movie, a thriller, at its best!  Further, I truly resent the cover of the DVD version of this movie, showing young Foster as she appeared to be bathed in blood with the come on line ""Ask her no question and nobody dies.""

This is my favorite Jodie Foster flick (yep, I even like it better than Silence Of The Lambs) as well as my favorite movie from the 70s. As Rynn, Ms. Foster is perfect! She was 13 (as was her character), going on 27, and comes across as cool, controlled, and mysterious. Living in her leased house, Rynn must use her smarts in order to survive and avoid discovery. Is her father alive? What's the real story about her mother? Will that nasty / nosey Mrs. Hallet (Alexis Smith) ever leave Rynn in peace? Will Hallet's disgusting and dangerous son (Martin Sheen) go too far? Will Mario (Scott ""Bad Ronald"" Jacoby) be able to help Rynn in her ruse? And what about officer Miglioriti? Will his suspicions unravel Rynn's carefully constructed life? And just what is down in that cellar anyway? TLGWLDTL is a twisty little mystery / thriller showcasing Jodie Foster's natural acting ability. She's so adult it's scary! I love some of Rynn's comments on public school (she's never set foot in it) for instance. She calls it stultifying. Rynn is a unique kid in a homogenized world. Her conversations with Mario are as enlightening as they are entertaining. I find myself wanting her to make it, even though her doom appears inevitable. Much has been made of her nude scene. It is very brief and I wasn't offended by it. The sexuality between Rynn and Mario is more implied than explicit or graphic. I had a harder time with the infamous hamster scene! Of course, this helps to define Sheen's character as a thoroughly repugnant human being. He is driven to have Rynn at all cost. Watching his increasingly obsessive / violent behavior toward her is disturbing and (sadly) familiar. He's just like the predators that fill our current papers and news programs. Enough about him!

She's homeschooled, takes care of all the household chores, and apparently caters to her father's every whim. Except that's not quite true. Her father is dead, dead for some months. He ardently believed that Rynn would grow up to be a stronger, more well-educated, more independent woman if she was left to her own devices rather than being put through the American foster system.To survive on your own as a 13 year old girl isn't easy, especially in an insular, bigoted small community like the one Rynn and her father settled in. She is set upon by the local matron, who doesn't like independent little girls who tell them how to act. Worse is the matron's son, Frank [Martin Sheen], who likes little girls way too much. She has only two recently-made friends, Officer Miglioriti [Mort Shuman] and his nephew, Mario the Magician [Scott Jacoby]. But that's all she needs. That and her father's teachings--he taught her to protect herself under any circumstances, and her moral code (or amoral code) is centered on her survival.This makes Rynn Jacobs a perfect horror hero, and also one of the most original horror heros the genre has seen. Rarely do women get to play the lead in horror, even more rarely do young women win such roles. And this movie was made two years before Halloween, a decade before Alien.

But I do know a lot of people who had seen it on TV growing up and their enthusiasm made me curious.Now I understand.  Though sometimes tonally uneven, this is a captivating little puzzler that somehow combines elements of 70s afterschool specials, Roald Dahl, Poe, low-budget horror and a single-set stage play... with apparent nods to Pinter and Orton.A young Jodie Foster (at roughly the same age as when she played Iris in ""Taxi Driver"") stars as a teenaged girl attempting to conceal from the world that she's an orphan living alone.  Her obvious intelligence and uncanny maturity shield her nicely from most adults (she loves Emily Dickinson and Chopin and is teaching herself Hebrew) but then she's set upon by a pushy, presumptuous landlady and by the landlady's lecherous son, a turtleneck-clad mama's boy played by a stark Martin Sheen (not long after he made ""Badlands"").What happens next needs to be seen with as little advance knowledge as possible.  And though the dialogue and music sometimes shift into melodrama (""Don't ever leave,"" the 13-year-old girl tells her new boyfriend, an amateur magician), the shifts almost seem intentional, a means of making the twists that much more surprising and unsettling.This is a strange and cool little movie, a true underseen sleeper, occasionally quite shocking and a perfect example of a film that arrived far, far ahead of its time.",4,"""None of your little tricks....""",1129939200,"10 22, 2005",2005,1522,"['What', 'bizarre', 'frequently', 'astonishing', 'little', 'thriller', 'lot', 'reviewers', 'here', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'do', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'seen', 'TV', 'growing', 'up', 'enthusiasm', 'made', 'curious.Now', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'tonally', 'uneven', 'captivating', 'little', 'puzzler', 'somehow', 'combines', 'elements', '70s', 'afterschool', 'specials', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'Poe', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'single-set', 'stage', 'play', 'apparent', 'nods', 'Pinter', 'Orton.A', 'young', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'roughly', 'same', 'age', 'when', 'played', 'Iris', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'teenaged', 'girl', 'attempting', 'conceal', 'world', 'orphan', 'living', 'alone', 'obvious', 'intelligence', 'uncanny', 'maturity', 'shield', 'nicely', 'most', 'adults', 'Emily', 'Dickinson', 'Chopin', 'teaching', 'Hebrew', 'then', 'set', 'upon', 'pushy', 'presumptuous', 'landlady', 'landlady', 'lecherous', 'son', 'turtleneck-clad', 'mama', 'boy', 'played', 'stark', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'not', 'long', 'made', 'Badlands', '.What', 'next', 'needs', 'be', 'seen', 'as', 'little', 'advance', 'knowledge', 'possible', 'dialogue', 'music', 'sometimes', 'shift', 'melodrama', 'Do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'leave', '13-year-old', 'girl', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'amateur', 'magician', 'shifts', 'almost', 'seem', 'intentional', 'means', 'making', 'twists', 'much', 'more', 'surprising', 'unsettling.This', 'strange', 'cool', 'little', 'movie', 'true', 'underseen', 'sleeper', 'occasionally', 'quite', 'shocking', 'perfect', 'example', 'film', 'arrived', 'far', 'far', 'ahead', 'time']",Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane VHS

292285,A30T2B7RFWGYNU,6302036054,FRED C. DOBBS,"[2, 2]","Great title drew me to this film. The interesting plot and presence of Jodie and Sheen made me buy it and give it a look as these two are rarely in a lousy film. Very glad it is now part of my collection. All about a 13-year old who ""appears"" to be living in a rented cottage with her dad. Only problem is her dad is never around when the nosey renter, the neighborhood pedophile and the town cop come around asking questions. Sheen is superb as the annoying and salacious pedo-man, veteran actress Alexis Smith is good as the snooty and prying renter and Scott Jacoby, who I fondly remember for his numerous early-mid 70's made-for-TV movies, is wonderful as the young man who befriends Foster, helps hide her secrets and falls in love with her. Nice sparse Canadian rural location dovetails well with Foster's solitude & fortitude. Haven't seen Sheen this sociopathic since great cult classic THE INCIDENT [1967]. I was taken aback by the brief Foster nude scene but, then again, I'm still watching Andy Griffith re-runs. Only shortcomings: 1-Jacoby masquerading as the absent dad just plain ludicrous and, 2-the soundtrack was a mess with classic Chopin alternating with something that sounded like it could be used for a 70's skin flick.

I agree with other reviewers that the story tried to deliver the right message about independence and not letting others change you into what they want you to be. But lets face it, in real life a 13 year old living on her own is not a wise idea. At the end her character even admits that they thought of everything except for loneliness and the need for human companionship. I also felt that the 13 year old carrying on a sexual relationship, let alone with someone who was obviously older than her was disturbing.

This movie is a snoozer from a horror movie fan's perspective.  I am not talking about the movie's lack of gore either...I don't care about that.  ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is not a horror movie at all and, is quite frankly, dull as a suspense thriller and/or mystery flick.  True, one wonders about the little girl's father and she is eccentric to say the least, but that's not enough to hold the suspense thriller fan's interest.  ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is more of a romance movie with a little bit of mystery and is all about an eccentric weird girl who wants to be able to live alone, her way and without any interference from anyone.  That being said, I do not think there is enough here for a suspense thriller much less a horror movie.  True, Jodie Foster is a good actress, but she looks like a freak with her hairdo in this movie.  It is truly sad that you will find ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" in the horror section of video/dvd stores.  No matter what your pleasure is, this movie fails to deliver the goods.  The problem with this movie is that it is simply boring, and not enough action takes place in this movie.  The only viewers that will find this movie to be exceptional are the die-hard Jodie Foster fans.  While I appreciate good acting, there still has to be a compelling enough script to hold one's interest.  I would argue that you do not have this in ""Little Girl"".  To be perfectly frank, this movie should be called ""The Boring Adventures of The Weird Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane and Her Idiot Dorky Little Magician Friend""...that about sums it up.",1,"0 STARS: As a horror movie, this movie sucks!",1151625600,"06 30, 2006",2006,1748,"['Someone', 'once', 'told', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'snoozer', 'horror', 'movie', 'fan', 'perspective', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'movie', 'lack', 'gore', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'not', 'horror', 'movie', 'quite', 'frankly', 'dull', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'and/or', 'mystery', 'flick', 'True', 'one', 'wonders', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'eccentric', 'say', 'least', 'not', 'enough', 'hold', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'fan', 'interest', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'more', 'romance', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'mystery', 'eccentric', 'weird', 'girl', 'who', 'be', 'able', 'live', 'alone', 'way', 'interference', 'anyone', 'being', 'said', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'enough', 'here', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'much', 'less', 'horror', 'movie', 'True', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'good', 'actress', 'freak', 'hairdo', 'movie', 'truly', 'sad', 'will', 'find', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'horror', 'section', 'video/dvd', 'stores', 'matter', 'what', 'pleasure', 'movie', 'deliver', 'goods', 'problem', 'movie', 'simply', 'boring', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'place', 'movie', 'only', 'viewers', 'will', 'find', 'movie', 'be', 'exceptional', 'are', 'die-hard', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'fans', 'appreciate', 'good', 'acting', 'still', 'be', 'compelling', 'enough', 'script', 'hold', 'one', 'interest', 'would', 'argue', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'Little', 'Girl', 'be', 'perfectly', 'frank', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'Boring', 'Adventures', 'Weird', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'Her', 'Idiot', 'Dorky', 'Little', 'Magician', 'Friend', 'sums', 'up']",Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane VHS
292289,A14JEURPY1CXZB,6302036054,James D. Leverton,"[15, 16]","Possibly the best of Jodie Foster's post ""Taxi Driver"" adolescent films, Nicolas Gessner's ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is a terrific, creepy psychological thriller about an abandoned thirteen-year-old girl who will resort to anything to remain living alone in her father's house, even murder.  Her murder weapons of choice?  Arsenic, and the unseen creature (or whatever it is) that lives in the basement.Martin Sheen, Scott Jacoby and Alexis Smith co-star as potential victims, but this film is Foster's showcase all-the-way.  She is terrific in this ultra-creepy fright-fest which concentrates on pulling the strings of psychological horror rather than offering a full-frontal, visual assault on the viewer.  And giving away any more of the plot would be a cheat; it's best for the viewer to experience what happens him/herself.  A word of warning, however:  some viewers who are partial to gore and action in their horror flicks would be well-advised to steer clear and check out the ""Friday the 13th"" films instead.  But for psychological horror fans, ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane"" is hard to beat.One question:  with Foster's success in the suspense/horror genre as an adult (""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Panic Room"" and the upcoming ""Flight Plan""), why did it take 28 years for this film to become widely available on video?  That said, kudos to MGM/UA for not only finally presenting this classic for mass viewing, but for offering it in its original widescreen format.  Evidently there are no more features, but who's complaining?  At least we have another great film, long unavailable and unseen on any format (including TV), finally available for consumption.

But it takes this low budget, far from Hitchcock level film to actually achieve a level of moral uncertainty. Jody Foster plays a too smart for her own good teen who has hidden her poet father's death  and continues to live on her own. She is set upon by her prejudiced  virago of a landlady (Alexis Smith), and the landlady's pedophile son (Martin Sheen). We casually learn over the course of the film that the young girl has poisoned her birth mother.( This fact will play significantly into the movie's final scene.) She is befriended by a local policeman (Mort Shuman of 'Jacques Brel' fame), and his amateur magician nephew (Scott Jacoby). (The uncertain age of this nephew is part of the film's ambiguity. His sexual relationship with the Foster character may be as illegal as what Sheen wants to do ! -The brief nude sequence with Foster, obviously cut from television showings of the film, is seriously disturbing on many levels.)The source of the film is a novel, but much of the structure seems oddly stage bound. Mostly filmed on a single set, the living room, dining room and kitchen of an old house, it plays out like one of those old-fashioned stage thrillers.Foster and Jacoby are simply too likable for all of their wild behavior.

""Little Girl"" was a modest box office success from American International (now acquired by MGM) which features one of Foster's best performances--younger or older; her Rynn Jacobs is purposefully cut off from the world, wise and alone, and she's forced to match wits with intruders like Alexis Smith as the nasty Cora Hallet. Not a big-budget release, the film carefully builds atmosphere within the one major set using a terrific group of actors, eerie-romantic music and a solid script. And Jodie, who reportedly was uneasy making this film(with the sexual aspects and the scene with the hamster), is so incredibly vivid: whether hiding a chipped front tooth(as per the novel), lighting a cigarette from a birthday cake candle, or showing off Gordon, she's mesmerizing. Two minutes were added from the European cut: a playful F-word and some nudity featuring an obvious body-double for Foster (actually, it was older sis Connie Foster who stepped in to disrobe).",5,Remarkable thriller has finally arrived!,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",2005,1075,"['almost', 'fell', 'when', 'read', 'one', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'best', 'films', 'finally', 'DVD', 'hidden', 'away', 'no', 'longer', 'Little', 'Girl', 'was', 'modest', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'American', 'International', 'now', 'acquired', 'MGM', 'one', 'Foster', 'best', 'performances', 'younger', 'older', 'Rynn', 'Jacobs', 'purposefully', 'cut', 'off', 'world', 'wise', 'alone', 'forced', 'match', 'wits', 'intruders', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'nasty', 'Cora', 'Hallet', 'Not', 'big-budget', 'release', 'film', 'carefully', 'atmosphere', 'one', 'major', 'set', 'using', 'terrific', 'group', 'actors', 'eerie-romantic', 'music', 'solid', 'script', 'Jodie', 'who', 'reportedly', 'was', 'uneasy', 'making', 'film', 'sexual', 'aspects', 'scene', 'hamster', 'so', 'incredibly', 'vivid', 'hiding', 'chipped', 'front', 'tooth', 'novel', 'lighting', 'cigarette', 'birthday', 'cake', 'candle', 'showing', 'off', 'Gordon', 'mesmerizing', 'Two', 'minutes', 'were', 'added', 'European', 'cut', 'playful', 'F-word', 'nudity', 'featuring', 'obvious', 'body-double', 'Foster', 'actually', 'was', 'older', 'sis', 'Connie', 'Foster', 'who', 'stepped', 'disrobe']",Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane VHS
292295,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,6302036054,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[12, 12]","This movie is a bit of a curiosity.  I'm not surprised that people picking up the DVD expecting to see a horror movie are a little disappointed.  Yet, with the provocative product description one might, at least, expect a thriller.  This is how the movie was sold in its day and how it continues to be sold.  For me,  ""The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane"" has always been an interesting character study--but one with a decidedly creepy edge.The film may seem a little dated to modern audiences, but that's to be expected.  Upon my most recent viewing, I was completely put off at how many times someone barged right into the house!  And Martin Sheen was so recognizably villainous from his first moment on screen--I wouldn't have minded some shading behind the character, something less obvious.But, as everyone can agree, the film belongs to Jodie Foster.  Cool and intelligent, resourceful and belligerent--it is a masterful performance.  But I guess that's to be expected, this was the same year Foster was Oscar nominated for ""Taxi Driver"".  One of Foster's chief assets, and it remains true to this day, is that she always just seems so much smarter than anyone else around her.I admire ""Little Girl"" for just this reason.  It is a progressive look at a young girl who is wise and adult beyond her years.  She is allowed to be unsympathetic, she is allowed to be sexual, she is allowed to be independent.  WOW!  Imagine having written a role that doesn't condescend.  Today, actresses don't mature on screen until their thirties (usually).  This film has the audacity and bravery to respect it's lead character (who is 13) and let the viewer make up it's own mind about her.

292296,A6ADO7B6FUVN,6302036054,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[6, 10]","Jodie Foster began her acting career at the age of two making commercials while she entered the television drama scene a few years later.  Her big break emerged when she received a spot in Scorsese's Taxi Driver (1976), as she performed the part of the teen prostitute Iris.  It was a part that received an Oscar nomination 1977.  The same year Taxi Driver was released another film surfaced where she had the role of the story's protagonist.  It was titled, The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, where she portrays the tough and independent 13-year old Rynn, a poet's daughter, who lives in a leased house all by herself.  Again, she performs brilliantly, however, this part did not land her any Oscars, but she had the opportunity to polish her talent with Martin Sheen performing against her.The low rays of the fall sunset reflect off the New England seashore waves, as the camera smoothly pans to the right in the opening scene.  Together with the beach, Foster's character emerges in full contrasting figure due to the daylight's reflection bouncing of the water.  Rynn stops and stares out over the water, as if she were looking for something, maybe an answer, or for help.  In either case, the scene provides some insight to Rynn's character's thoughtful persona and the ambiguousness atmosphere that later appears in the film.  Her solitary presence on the beach also gives a conceptual idea of her position in society, as she lives in a small leased without anyone caring for her.Quickly after the opening credits the story jumps into the middle of the story, as Rynn celebrates her own thirteenth birthday on Halloween night.  If this does not evoke any kind of anticipation, the audience might not be aware of the American culture, or the neglectful abuse parents accomplish by neglecting a child's birthday.  Nonetheless, Rynn goes about her business, as if she did not expect anything else.  The isolated seclusion and loneliness of Rynn immediately wins over the audience to her side, as the audience does not know what to expect form the story.  Consequently, someone is knocking on the door and it is Frank (Martin Sheen), a lone trick-or-treating adult.  The initial meeting between Rynn and Frank delivers a significantly tense moment, which intensifies when Frank snoops around in the cottage and asks about the father's whereabouts.  It is clear that Frank knows something, but what we never find out.  However, his presence augments the audience's favorable feelings toward Rynn, as her vulnerability increases with the pedophilic tendencies of Frank.The story in itself focuses on the father, who obviously never emerges, as Rynn repeatedly lies about his location to all that ask.  Through clever camera use, the audience learns about secretively guarded secret that Rynn hides.  The secret seems to hide in the basement, as Rynn works hard on keeping the nosy people from her house, including Frank and the owner.  The secrecy within the film enhances the apprehension in regards to Rynn. It is obvious that something is wrong, and the initial positive mind-set toward Rynn begins to rumble.  The ambiguous nature of the story brings forth an intriguing notion in regards to human nature that humans often have more than the image that they attempt to portray to the people in the social setting.The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane is a highly atmospheric story much due to a combination between the cinematography, scene framing, score, and the performances by the cast, which all helps strengthen the secrecy and suspense within the film.  The director Nicholas Gessner's delicate handling of taboo issues also increases the uncertainty that seems to linger in the air, as the audience never knows what will happen next.  It shows that Gessner has a brilliant eye on how to build up a solid thriller, however, after having seen the film it feels like there is something significant missing.  The film strongly flirts with the audience's anticipation, but it never delivers anything to relieve the tense atmosphere.  Instead, the film only leaves the viewer with a highly teasing experience of what could have happened.  Yet, within the ambiguousness the story and the open-ended feeling leaves the audience with the idea of finishing the story for themselves. Gessner's cinematic creation leaves the viewer with a clever depiction of something very captivating, which delivers both a terrific and awkward cinematic experience depending how the viewer approaches the film.Jodie Foster's performance is an excellent reason to why the viewer should experience this captivating thriller.  In addition, Gessner's direction helps keep the story fascinating.  The combination between these, the direction, and the acting helps develop a unique cinematic experience that will linger for some time in the back of the mind.",4,A Captivating Tale with a Lingering Eerie Atmosphere...,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,4847,"['Jodie', 'Foster', 'began', 'acting', 'career', 'age', 'two', 'making', 'commercials', 'entered', 'television', 'drama', 'scene', 'few', 'years', 'later', 'big', 'break', 'emerged', 'when', 'received', 'spot', 'Scorsese', 'Taxi', 'Driver', '1976', 'performed', 'part', 'teen', 'prostitute', 'Iris', 'was', 'part', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', '1977', 'same', 'year', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'was', 'released', 'film', 'surfaced', 'where', 'had', 'role', 'story', 'protagonist', 'was', 'titled', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'where', 'tough', 'independent', '13-year', 'old', 'Rynn', 'poet', 'daughter', 'who', 'leased', 'house', 'Again', 'brilliantly', 'however', 'part', 'did', 'not', 'land', 'Oscars', 'had', 'opportunity', 'polish', 'talent', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'performing', 'her.The', 'low', 'rays', 'fall', 'sunset', 'reflect', 'off', 'New', 'England', 'seashore', 'waves', 'camera', 'smoothly', 'right', 'opening', 'scene', 'Together', 'beach', 'Foster', 'character', 'full', 'contrasting', 'figure', 'due', 'daylight', 'reflection', 'bouncing', 'water', 'Rynn', 'stops', 'out', 'water', 'were', 'looking', 'something', 'maybe', 'answer', 'help', 'case', 'scene', 'insight', 'Rynn', 'character', 'thoughtful', 'persona', 'ambiguousness', 'atmosphere', 'later', 'film', 'solitary', 'presence', 'beach', 'also', 'conceptual', 'idea', 'position', 'society', 'small', 'leased', 'anyone', 'caring', 'her.Quickly', 'opening', 'story', 'middle', 'story', 'Rynn', 'own', 'thirteenth', 'birthday', 'Halloween', 'night', 'not', 'evoke', 'kind', 'anticipation', 'audience', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'aware', 'American', 'culture', 'neglectful', 'abuse', 'parents', 'accomplish', 'neglecting', 'child', 'birthday', 'Nonetheless', 'Rynn', 'business', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'anything', 'else', 'isolated', 'seclusion', 'loneliness', 'Rynn', 'immediately', 'audience', 'side', 'audience', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'form', 'story', 'Consequently', 'someone', 'knocking', 'door', 'Frank', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'lone', 'trick-or-treating', 'adult', 'initial', 'meeting', 'Rynn', 'Frank', 'significantly', 'tense', 'moment', 'when', 'Frank', 'around', 'cottage', 'father', 'whereabouts', 'clear', 'Frank', 'something', 'what', 'never', 'find', 'out', 'However', 'presence', 'audience', 'favorable', 'feelings', 'Rynn', 'vulnerability', 'pedophilic', 'tendencies', 'Frank.The', 'story', 'father', 'who', 'obviously', 'never', 'Rynn', 'repeatedly', 'location', 'ask', 'clever', 'camera', 'use', 'audience', 'secretively', 'guarded', 'secret', 'Rynn', 'secret', 'hide', 'basement', 'Rynn', 'hard', 'keeping', 'nosy', 'people', 'house', 'including', 'Frank', 'owner', 'secrecy', 'film', 'apprehension', 'regards', 'Rynn', 'obvious', 'something', 'wrong', 'initial', 'positive', 'mind-set', 'Rynn', 'rumble', 'ambiguous', 'nature', 'story', 'forth', 'intriguing', 'notion', 'regards', 'human', 'nature', 'humans', 'often', 'have', 'more', 'image', 'attempt', 'portray', 'people', 'social', 'setting.The', 'Little', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Down', 'Lane', 'highly', 'atmospheric', 'story', 'much', 'due', 'combination', 'cinematography', 'scene', 'framing', 'score', 'performances', 'cast', 'strengthen', 'secrecy', 'suspense', 'film', 'director', 'Nicholas', 'Gessner', 'delicate', 'handling', 'taboo', 'issues', 'also', 'uncertainty', 'linger', 'air', 'audience', 'never', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'Gessner', 'brilliant', 'eye', 'how', 'build', 'up', 'solid', 'thriller', 'however', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'something', 'significant', 'missing', 'film', 'strongly', 'audience', 'anticipation', 'never', 'anything', 'relieve', 'tense', 'atmosphere', 'Instead', 'film', 'only', 'viewer', 'highly', 'teasing', 'experience', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'happened', 'ambiguousness', 'story', 'open-ended', 'feeling', 'audience', 'idea', 'finishing', 'story', 'Gessner', 'cinematic', 'creation', 'viewer', 'clever', 'depiction', 'something', 'very', 'captivating', 'terrific', 'awkward', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'depending', 'how', 'viewer', 'film.Jodie', 'Foster', 'performance', 'excellent', 'reason', 'why', 'viewer', 'should', 'experience', 'captivating', 'thriller', 'addition', 'Gessner', 'direction', 'keep', 'story', 'fascinating', 'combination', 'direction', 'acting', 'develop', 'unique', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'will', 'linger', 'time', 'back', 'mind']",Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane VHS

It's hard to believe it's been almost thirty years since I first saw this film, but it is; when I rented it last weekend on a nostalgia trip, I found that it's lost none of its brilliance over time.Much of that has to do with the performances of the two principals, Jodie Foster (fresh off her success in Taxi Driver) and Martin Sheen (three years after Badlands, three years before Apocalypse Now). Foster plays a thirteen-year-old girl menaced by pedophile Sheen, but takes care of herself quite nicely in that regard (in fact, Foster's character here might have been the poster-child for what is known today as empowerment). There's a subplot going on about Foster's mysterious father, whom no one ever sees, and a related coming-of-age one about her falling in love with the nephew of a member of the local constabulary. All of it is handled quite nicely, and while things are rushed, they're done as well as they can be; chalk it up to Laird Koenig adapting his own novel for the screen. It's almost enough to forgive the large gaps those who have read the book will notice, and Gessner's almost amateurish handling of the passage of time (it seems almost as if Foster and the nephew, played by Diary of Anne Frank/Return to Horror High star Scott Jacoby, go from wary acquaintances to lovers overnight, since Jacoby does nothing to show the passage of weeks except add snow to the scene; he must not have ever lived in Cleveland, where snow on Halloween may be uncommon, but does happen now and then).Highly underrated atmospheric suspense.

292307,A21EGMJ3E78LPV,6302036054,"R. Pepper ""DaysFan79""","[3, 3]","Whether you are a fan of Jodie Foster, love films with only a handful of characters or just enjoy watching a really good old drama/mystery than this one is worth owning and having in your collection for future viewings. Jodie Foster plays thirteen-year old Rynn who hides the secret that she lives alone. Alexis Smith plays her nosy landlord Mrs. Hallet and Martin Sheen is her pedophile son Frank Hallet who the viewer will quickly begin to despise. Scott Jacoby plays her new friend/boyfriend Mario who helps Rynn keep her secret a secret. Mort Shuman is Mario's cop uncle who pays a few visits to Rynn's haven. With only 5 main characters and a few locations mostly at Rynn's home, much of this film focuses on character interaction and development. As you follow along, you find out why Rynn lives alone. What happened to her father? What happened to her mother? What happens when people find out Rynn's secret that she slyly  keeps hidden away? The sound and picture on the DVD is clean and crisp. No extras which is a shame because I have never heard Jodie talk about this film and it would be interesting to hear her thoughts on it. Jodie was a perfect choice for this film. Her character Rynn is a very intelligent young adult and it's fun watching her match wits with the people who are trying to expose her. I give this film 4.5 stars. If you enjoy this film, I also recommend Death and the Maiden which also includes a cast of only three people including Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley and takes place in only a few locations. Much of that films focus is solely on character interaction and development as well and like this one, the suspense builds at a nice pace. There are a few people who gave this film 1-2 stars because it's wasn't a horror film. It's not trying to be a horror film nor do I believe it was ever advertised as one. Take it for what it is and you have a very enjoybable picture.",5,"""It's probably the almond cookies.""",1190592000,"09 24, 2007",2007,1913,"['are', 'fan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'love', 'films', 'only', 'handful', 'characters', 'just', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'really', 'good', 'old', 'drama/mystery', 'one', 'worth', 'owning', 'having', 'collection', 'future', 'viewings', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'thirteen-year', 'old', 'Rynn', 'who', 'secret', 'alone', 'Alexis', 'Smith', 'nosy', 'landlord', 'Mrs.', 'Hallet', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'pedophile', 'son', 'Frank', 'Hallet', 'who', 'viewer', 'will', 'quickly', 'begin', 'despise', 'Scott', 'Jacoby', 'new', 'friend/boyfriend', 'Mario', 'who', 'Rynn', 'keep', 'secret', 'secret', 'Mort', 'Shuman', 'Mario', 'cop', 'uncle', 'who', 'few', 'visits', 'Rynn', 'haven', 'only', '5', 'main', 'characters', 'few', 'locations', 'mostly', 'Rynn', 'home', 'much', 'film', 'character', 'interaction', 'development', 'follow', 'along', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'Rynn', 'alone', 'What', 'happened', 'father', 'What', 'happened', 'mother', 'What', 'when', 'people', 'find', 'out', 'Rynn', 'secret', 'slyly', 'keeps', 'hidden', 'away', 'sound', 'picture', 'DVD', 'clean', 'crisp', 'extras', 'shame', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'Jodie', 'talk', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'hear', 'thoughts', 'Jodie', 'was', 'perfect', 'choice', 'film', 'character', 'Rynn', 'very', 'intelligent', 'young', 'adult', 'fun', 'watching', 'match', 'wits', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'trying', 'expose', 'give', 'film', '4.5', 'stars', 'enjoy', 'film', 'also', 'recommend', 'Death', 'Maiden', 'also', 'cast', 'only', 'three', 'people', 'including', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'place', 'only', 'few', 'locations', 'Much', 'films', 'focus', 'solely', 'character', 'interaction', 'development', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'suspense', 'nice', 'pace', 'are', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'gave', 'film', '1-2', 'stars', 'was', ""n't"", 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'trying', 'be', 'horror', 'film', 'do', 'believe', 'was', 'ever', 'advertised', 'one', 'Take', 'what', 'have', 'very', 'enjoybable', 'picture']",Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane VHS

First of all, I loved the production quality, atmosphere and locale. The acting was first class and shows Jodie's soon to blossom strong talents. Martin Sheen probably won't be happy to see his character reprised, he is not a nice guy in this film, especially with Jodie Foster. The direction and score are excellent as well.The plausibility of Jodie Foster's character behaving essentially as an adult stretched things a bit. It was a little rough for me to buy into a 14-year-old cooking gourmet meals, serving fine wines, listening to Chopin and generally acting much older than her chronological age. Even taking into consideration the events in her life, which apparently hadshaped her personality, she seemed too mature for her age. If you put that concern aside however and accept it as a given premise of the movie you can sit back and enjoy the fun of trying to figure out what's going on.The film takes pleasure with its twists and turns and will keep you guessing.Update:  The previous 1 star rating was an error.  4 stars is correct",4,DVD at Last,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,1169,"['Long', 'lost', 'forgotten', 'finially', 'coming', 'DVD', 'widescreen', 'local', 'used', 'film', 'exactly', 'First', 'loved', 'production', 'quality', 'atmosphere', 'locale', 'acting', 'was', 'first', 'class', 'Jodie', 'soon', 'blossom', 'strong', 'talents', 'Martin', 'Sheen', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'happy', 'see', 'character', 'reprised', 'not', 'nice', 'guy', 'film', 'especially', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'direction', 'score', 'are', 'excellent', 'well.The', 'plausibility', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'character', 'behaving', 'essentially', 'adult', 'stretched', 'things', 'bit', 'was', 'little', 'rough', 'buy', '14-year-old', 'cooking', 'gourmet', 'meals', 'serving', 'fine', 'wines', 'listening', 'Chopin', 'generally', 'acting', 'much', 'older', 'chronological', 'age', 'Even', 'taking', 'consideration', 'events', 'life', 'apparently', 'hadshaped', 'personality', 'seemed', 'too', 'mature', 'age', 'put', 'concern', 'aside', 'however', 'accept', 'given', 'premise', 'movie', 'can', 'sit', 'back', 'enjoy', 'fun', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'on.The', 'film', 'pleasure', 'twists', 'turns', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing.Update', 'previous', '1', 'star', 'rating', 'was', 'error', '4', 'stars', 'correct']",Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane VHS

And something--or someone--is in the basement.  Something Rynn desperately wants to conceal.But her secret does come out--with fatal consequences.This is the story of a loner who, facing cataclysmic events, finally learns to reach out to the one who befriends her: Mario, a young amateur magician.""I'm not going to play their game,"" she insists.""Well, you've got to trust somebody,"" Mario replies.But in trusting him, Rynn places his life in danger.  She has to confront the final threat alone--as the trap door to the cellar creaks open.  It's that scene that made me scream--begging her to run to the kitchen and grab a knife!She doesn't ... facing the final menace armed only with her wits.This is great drama--a harrowing story of individualism, courage, and trust.
