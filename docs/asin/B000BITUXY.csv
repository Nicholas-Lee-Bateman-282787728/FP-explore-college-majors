Dressed in all black, and yet being the good guy was a stark contrast to the rest of the ""adult westerns"" of that era.

942911,A3UVJ9MTY877ZW,B000BITUXY,"Aukake Jaye ""Mosley fan""","[0, 0]","Have Gun Will Travel is my second favorite classic western.  Paladin is a dream.  A rich, cultured, cool, sexy,intelligent and expensive rugged gun figher with a good sense of morals.  He offers the best of both worlds.  His travels provide insight to the settling of the ""old west"" and the challenges to the settlers.  The time period is a curosity.  He lives in an opulent San Francisco Hotel, yet is comfortable sleeping in the wild.  Paladin has access to various city newspapers soon after they are printed.  He travels by horse, stage, and train.  All of these features make the program series more interesting.The purchase of the set of the first three seasons was a good purchase for me.  Looking forward to the next set.

Some things never change!!! I was hoping that all the seasons would be available, but I'm beginning to see that it won't happen. This was one of the best cowboy programs to ever grace a tv screen and that isn't only my view! The stories were well written and well executed...but the thing that really sets this series apart from the rest is the educational aspect: Paladin was constantly teaching the villains (and consequently the viewers) things of value. He often quoted Shakespeare and the Bible...both of which provide great lessons to be learned! That may not be politically correct, but it is true nonetheless. I am hoping the rest of the series is released, but do not expect it. Sadly, there is probably not enough of a market for it.",5,Great programming!,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,867,"['used', 'watch', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'kid', 'was', 'original', 'airing', 'guess', 'just', 'dated', 'loved', 'things', 'never', 'change', 'was', 'hoping', 'seasons', 'would', 'be', 'available', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'see', 'wo', ""n't"", 'happen', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'cowboy', 'programs', 'ever', 'grace', 'tv', 'screen', ""n't"", 'only', 'view', 'stories', 'were', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'executed', 'thing', 'really', 'series', 'apart', 'rest', 'educational', 'aspect', 'Paladin', 'was', 'constantly', 'teaching', 'villains', 'consequently', 'viewers', 'things', 'value', 'often', 'quoted', 'Shakespeare', 'Bible', 'provide', 'great', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'true', 'nonetheless', 'am', 'hoping', 'rest', 'series', 'released', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'Sadly', 'probably', 'not', 'enough', 'market']",N/A

If you were a fan of Paladin then you will really enjoy these DVDs, especially since there are no commercials. My hope is that seasons 4-6 will eventually become available on DVD.If you are not familiar with the Have Gun Will Travel TV show then you should be. It was one of the most classic western TV shows I ever watched. Paladin is a gunfighter for hire but definitely not your typical one. He has morals, intelligence, experience and bravado.

And the acting is still as good as you would expect in this type of show.
