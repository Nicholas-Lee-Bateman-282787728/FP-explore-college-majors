Well, he did. WHY it flopped at the box office I'm not sure. Other than he had just gotten out of the Army and his Fans wanted to have movies with him singing in it all the time. THEN THERE WAS COL. PARKER, he liked controlling Elvis in all respects. And he was very good at it in all respects. I personally believe that he had a lot to do with how Elvis's life turned out. So Sad! Not that Col. Parker wasn't a good manager and got Elvis really in the spot light early on. He just ignored Elvis when he tried to explain to Parker, what he really wanted to do with his life.This is his best movie in my opinion. And it seems that many people since his death have come to realize just what a wonderful movie it is (was). I think he did a Fabulous, great job and showed another of his talents other than his singing ""Acting in a serious roll"". I would recommend this to any one who loved Elvis and respected him.I also, got good service from Amazon, well packed, new DVD. But, I think there are a few of his DVD's out now that Amazon has priced a little to high for some people. Still good service, tho.

267350,A5UQAS0EYI85G,6301798074,cheesefilms,"[1, 10]","You have got to be kidding me. At which point do we not see a predictable line or reaction to Elvis' character? A half white and Kiowa settler that plays guitar for a square dancing shin-dig, while hated by whites and Indians alike, c'mon folks, let's get real here. Barbara Eden and Steve Forrest carried the film through some really insulting native scenes. What really seems crazy is in one scene towards the end, he is running around shirtless with the body of a flat-chested, 12 year old girl with the Indians as an Indian ally, and the next minute he is taking on Kiowa warriors like a one man killing machine.When I showed this DVD to my 25 year old daughter, she thought it was a gay western like""Brokeback Mountain"" (come to think of it, he wore more eyeliner and makeup than Barbara Eden?) I had to explain to her that it was America's number one idol of all time to which she insisted he still looked like a homosexual.Many of the standard Hollywood insults towards Indians here like broken English from Italian or Latino actors with names like ""Buffalo Horn"" and the oldie but goodie, ""Two Moons""; everyone in the Indian village is dressed the SAME; the Indians practically laid down during fight scenes and were weak; all the women were painted as weak with Elvis being the only subservient man to his Kiowa mother and the Indians leader was depicted as stupid and ""out there"". The only realism about this film and perhaps the reasoning for this film is the ignorance and racism towards and about, the Indians, which still hasn't changed before or since this film. Sydney Pollacks comedy-western with Burt Lancaster during the same period, also about Italians playing Kiowas, ""The Scalphunters"", is far superior and less predictable.Elvis should have played a code-talker, but then again, America at the time was still hiding its native heroes from the big red boogie man.",1,An overrated entertainer,1291161600,"12 1, 2010",2010,1885,"['have', 'got', 'be', 'kidding', 'point', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'predictable', 'line', 'reaction', 'Elvis', 'character', 'half', 'white', 'Kiowa', 'settler', 'guitar', 'square', 'dancing', 'shin-dig', 'hated', 'whites', 'Indians', 'alike', ""c'mon"", 'folks', 'let', 'get', 'real', 'here', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'carried', 'film', 'really', 'insulting', 'native', 'scenes', 'What', 'really', 'crazy', 'one', 'scene', 'end', 'running', 'around', 'shirtless', 'body', 'flat-chested', '12', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'Indians', 'Indian', 'ally', 'next', 'minute', 'taking', 'Kiowa', 'warriors', 'one', 'man', 'killing', 'machine.When', 'showed', 'DVD', '25', 'year', 'old', 'daughter', 'thought', 'was', 'gay', 'western', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'come', 'think', 'wore', 'more', 'eyeliner', 'makeup', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'had', 'explain', 'was', 'America', 'number', 'one', 'idol', 'time', 'insisted', 'still', 'looked', 'homosexual.Many', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'insults', 'towards', 'Indians', 'here', 'broken', 'English', 'Italian', 'Latino', 'actors', 'names', 'Buffalo', 'Horn', 'oldie', 'goodie', 'Two', 'Moons', 'everyone', 'Indian', 'village', 'dressed', 'SAME', 'Indians', 'practically', 'laid', 'down', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'weak', 'women', 'were', 'painted', 'weak', 'Elvis', 'being', 'only', 'subservient', 'man', 'Kiowa', 'mother', 'Indians', 'leader', 'was', 'depicted', 'stupid', 'there', 'only', 'realism', 'film', 'perhaps', 'reasoning', 'film', 'ignorance', 'racism', 'towards', 'about', 'Indians', 'still', ""n't"", 'changed', 'before', 'film', 'Sydney', 'Pollacks', 'comedy-western', 'Burt', 'Lancaster', 'same', 'period', 'also', 'Italians', 'playing', 'Kiowas', 'Scalphunters', 'far', 'superior', 'less', 'predictable.Elvis', 'should', 'have', 'played', 'code-talker', 'then', 'again', 'America', 'time', 'was', 'still', 'hiding', 'native', 'heroes', 'big', 'red', 'boogie', 'man']",N/A
267351,A1YWUPCT83WY48,6301798074,"Claude Avary ""West Coast Reader""","[44, 44]","This is definitely the best film Elvis Presley ever starred in; he shed his celebrity persona and delivered a great, dramatic performance in a superb action story with teriffic characterizations. No doubt about it, in ""Flaming Star,"" Preseley is an ACTOR. And a damned good one too. (He only sings two songs, and they are presented right at the beginning so the film can then get down to the heavy business.)Originally, the material was written to star Marlon Brando, but was re-written to accomodate Elvis. He plays a half Kiowa man named Pacer who finds himself jammed in the middle of growing war between the settlers and the Kiowa. In trying not to take sides, he finds his world swirls down into violence and chaos. It is refreshingly devoid of ""can't we all get along"" cliches and really digs deep into the near-impossibility of life when you are split in two, like Pacer. Elvis really nails the character down.Director Siegel is at his usual great level of achievement: tight-lipped, boiling drama between the characters, and blasts of sometimes surprising violence. He doesn't let anybody off easily. This isn't a lightweight oater: Siegel took his craft seriously. Helping out are great performances from the superb cast, especially Delores Del Rio as Pacer's Kiowa mother.If you're looking for an Elvis musical, with the rock star persona in full blast, go for ""Jailhouse Rock,"" his second best film. If you want a fun and silly Elvis movie, go for the endearingly wacky ""Via Las Vegas.""

267368,AWHS1TFR7S1NL,6301798074,Michael A. Quebec,"[12, 13]","This was Elvis' first attempt at a dramatic non-singing role.  (He had done dramas before he went into the army.  Both ""Jailhouse Rock"" & ""King Creole"", though having music in them, were dramatic roles, albeit tailor-made to fit his persona.)This movie is a decent western with an important & relevant message on race relations (especially when you consider that it was made during the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement.)  Basically, the story takes place in Texas after the Civil War.  Elvis' character, Pacer Burton, is the son of a Texas Rancher & a woman of the Kiowa-Indian Tribe.  When the whites & Native Americans go to war (is this supposed to be the Red River War of the 1870's?), he & his family are caught in the middle.  It's a powerful movie with a simple (and that's the beauty of it) plot that unfortunately, was all too plausible during the settling of the Old West.  (Both Quannah Parker & the Bent Brothers were half-caste children of white/Indian parents & they eventually had to choose sides when the U.S. settlers/militia & Southern Plains Tribes went to war.)That's not to say that this film doesn't have flaws.  Some of the dialogue is laughable at times.  (Example:  ""I shall return again when the sun has killed the stars!""  Also, ""If Earth round, why men on bottom not fall off?"")  And the scene at the opening birthday party has Elvis singing ""A Cane & A High-Starched Collar"" to awkward square-dancing!  (It's the only on-screen song that Elvis sings in the movie.  The title tune is over the credits.  Well, at least it's not as bad as Frankie Avalon singing ""Gee Whizz, Golly Gee"" in ""The Tall Men"" or Fabian singing ""This Wonderful World"" in ""North To Alaska!"")  Also, from a historian's standpoint, it would have been nice if the film-makers had tied in the real-events of that time & place to this (fictional) story.  (I mention the Red River War, which actually took place in 1874 in Texas between white buffalo hunters/the U.S. Army & an alliance of Kiowas, Commanches, Southern Cheyennes, Southern Arapahos, & Plains Apaches.  If they had tied that real event to this story, it would have made the movie much more interesting.)Keep in mind, however, that any flaws in the script & direction do not take away from the power of the message in this film.  Most of the dialogue, as well as the incidental film-music is very good.Another customer reviewer (who, out of respect, I won't name!) criticized this movie because it wasn't a musical.  That's the real-life tragedy of this movie & Elvis' film-career.  Elvis was a great singer, a true pioneer of rock n' roll.  To be sure, there were MANY others (Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, Jerry Lee Lewis, LaVern Baker, Jackie Wilson, The Everly Brothers, Wanda Jackson, Red Prysock, Carl Perkins, Bo Diddley, JoAnn Campbell, Sam ""The Man"" Taylor, Brenda Lee, Larry & Lorrie Collins, Bill Haley, etc.  Did I name enough?!)  But in the popular mind, he (rightfully) is ranked above them all, at the top, ""The King"", if you will.  He also wanted to be (and I believe was capable of being) a great dramatic actor in the same vein as Marlon Brando (who was originally offered the part of ""Pacer"" in this film) & James Dean.  Unfortunatelly, SOME of his fans (like the afformentioned ""critic"") couldn't accept him in anything other than a musical!  (And BAD musicals at that!  Movies like ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" & ""Kissing Cousins"" are examples of this & Elvis himself eventually became frustrated & depressed over having to act in junk like that!)  The Colonel has been blamed for forcing bad scripts on Elvis, but the sad fact is that he was a business man & ""Flaming Star"", along with ""Wild In The Country"" failed to make significant profits at the box-office.  ""Blue Hawaii"", however, did make a huge profit.  It was THE FANS who dictated the Colonel's policy (and in no way am I implying that Parker was an honest businessman, but that's another story), & in the end, it's the fans who have to share in the blame for contributing to Elvis' decline as a successful (& serious) film-actor (and in a way contributing to his death, since it was this frustration, along with many other factors, which fueled his drug-dependency.)Frank Sinatra became a successful actor.  Likewise, Kris Kristofferson, Kenny Rogers, Barbara Streisand, Beth Midler, & Diana Ross have found success as actors.  The fans accepted these talented singers IN NON-MUSICAL ROLES.  It's a shame that WE (yes, I'm a big Elvis fan) couldn't do the same for Elvis.It's tempting to speculate what would have happened if this movie, instead of ""Love Me Tender"" (which also takes place after the Civil War) had been Elvis' first film.  Perhaps the fans would have been more inclined to accept him as an actor.  Oh well, we'll never know for sure.  One thing is certain, however.  ""Flaming Star"" is a good example of what (sadly) might & should have been.P.S.  A word on the ""violence"" in the movie.  The afformentioned ""critic"" also took exception to the level of ""violence"" in the film.  (Apparently, he showed it to his kids, assuming that just because it's an ""Elvis-film"", it's appropriate for family viewing.  He was shocked by the serious tone & offended by the action sequences.)  With respect to this person (and he is entitled to his opinion), ""Flaming Star"" is a WESTERN, one with social-commentary.  The action sequences are there to illustrate the tragedy of the story & are no means excessive.  Elvis & the people behind him DID NOT intended this movie to be marketed towards children & as such, it's a good idea to limit viewing of this movie towards viewers over the age of 12!  (Hey, it was made in 1960, for God's sakes!  They didn't have ratings back then!)",4,A Good Beginning...That Sadly Went Nowhere,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,5761,"['was', 'Elvis', 'first', 'attempt', 'dramatic', 'non-singing', 'role', 'had',

I just saw it in Cinemascope at the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood last night and I was stunned by its excellence.  I've often heard that this movie proved that Elvis could ""act"" but I've always been skeptical. I assumed the movie would be full of histrionic treacle and have studiously avoided it.Big mistake.  This movie is first rate, of the highest order.  Elvis has gotten knocked over the years for not making more movies like ""Flaming Star"".  But, when you really think about it, NO ONE made movies like ""Flaming Star"", in any era!The movie starts tragically and continues it's ever-widening downward spiral until the very end!  There's not a light moment in the picture (excluding the very first scene) and it's to be commended for not pulling any punches.  Shakespeare didn't write tragedy any better than this.That is why ""Flaming Star"" is so satisfying.  It stands apart from just about any film you can think of.  I LIKE tragedy and would like to see more of it.  But, evidently, tragedy doesn't sell and that's why Hollywood stays away from it.Not only does Elvis play the role of the half-breed Pacer perfectly but he is well-suited to the part.  Marlon Brando would not have been a good choice. Elvis looks the part of a half-breed and resembles his Indian ""brothers"" as much or more than his ""real"" white brother.Not enough has been said here at Amazon about the superb perfomances by John McIntire and Steve Forrest in this film.  I've seen both of them a million times in films and it's hard to get excited about either one of them.  But, in ""Flaming Star"", their performances are dead-on.

267388,A2D63RN5LF14R2,6301798074,"THE BLUEMAHLER ""THE BLUEMAHLER""","[2, 2]","Hollywood&#8217;s model of taking pop music phenomenons and placing them in film productions began with Bing Crosby and accelerated with Frank Sinatra. Unfortunately, producers were usually clueless as to how to tap the stars&#8217; prodigious talents. The model petered out in Madonna&#8217;s whisper of a film career. In between Madonna and Bing came the biggest and perhaps most disappointing of them all: Elvis Presley. Tinseltown did attempt to tailor its vehicles to Presley, which may have been one of its big missteps. Most critics and audiences concede that Presley&#8217;s early films were the best, though many might argue that is not saying much. Presley debuted in the Civil War era Western Love Me Tender (1956) with a supporting role, while Loving You (1957), Jailhouse Rock (1957) and King Creole (1958) all had thinly disguised biographical elements. Yet, none of these films fully captured the unbridled energy and vitality seen in just a few moments of Presley&#8217;s documentary footage of the period. G.I. Blues (1960) began a deadly slide, placing the star in dumbed-down, misogynistic family fare. Blues reached its nadir with the king of rock and roll singing to a puppet.Presley followed G.I. Blues with Flaming Star (1960), a progressive western, directed by that taut craftsman, Don Siegel. Presley desperately wanted a film career and envisioned one modeled after his film idol, Marlon Brando. Ironically, Siegel and the producers originally wanted Brando for Presley&#8217;s role of Pacer Burton. With Presley finally getting his chance at a Brandoesque role, he comes closest to the celluloid Elvis that he himself envisioned. Unfortunately, it was not what the American public wanted, and the result was a box office bomb, despite good critical reception. The public wanted Presley singing, not acting, and he only gets one song here (along with the title track). Despite the public indifference, Presley made another stab at dramatic acting in the Clifford Odets-penned Wild In The Country (1961). Miscasting aside, Presley, who was too seasoned to play a juvenile delinquent, gave a relatively good performance in a mediocre soaper. Again, the public did not respond, which signaled the star&#8217;s management team to take the reigns with Blue Hawaii (1961). This was Hollywood&#8217;s saccharine death kiss. A best-forgotten string of execrable movies followed, and it wasn&#8217;t until Presley left Hollywood that he became (briefly) vital again. With the &#8220;&#8217;68 Comeback Special&#8221; and several documentaries, Presley finally became an imposing film presence, simply by being the leading man in his own unique life. Of course, Vegas seduced the King, just as Hollywood did, but his second fall from grace was at least a more original and fascinating American parody.Although Flaming Star is imperfect, it gets one aesthetic component of the Presley paradox: Siegel shrewdly pinpoints the desperation and conflict inherent within an ambitious artist seeking to overcome his white trash origins. Here, he transplants them to Elvis as a half-breed. There has long been an identification amongst some whites with the archaic image of Native American as savage. Rather than tailoring a vehicle to Presley&#8217;s public persona, Siegel gives the actor an identification point within an already framed narrative. Stepping into Brando territory, Presley gives a thoroughly convincing and enthusiastic performance, possibly his only one as a professional actor.Presley and Siegel smartly and predominantly ignored the pop star&#8217;s fan base by tapping the star&#8217;s edginess and making him actually play a character in an ensemble. In the promo trailers, studio execs interpreted that &#8220;edge&#8221; as a shirtless Presley fighting a savage. The scene it&#8217;s culled from is actually brief, and renders the trailer grossly misleading. Rather, the real &#8220;edge&#8221; is Pacer nervously conversing through a door slat with unwelcome visitors, followed by his beating the hell out of two racists when they insult his mother Neddy (Delores del Rio). Siegel draws on Presley&#8217;s latent maternal fixation for the scene. (Interestingly, one of Presley&#8217;s most effective songs, amidst one too many Neil Diamond covers during his final John-Wayne-in-a-Shazam-cape phase was an intimate, maternal version of the rosary. Catering to the imagined mindset of the King&#8217;s alleged WASP fan base, Presley&#8217;s distributors usually omit it from the plethora of posthumously-released gospel compilations).Presley&#8217;s acting in Flaming Star is simple and not bogged down with the type of dialogue he would have been ill-suited for. While Brando would have given an excellent performance, Presley delivers a commendably natural one. As a half breed, he has divided loyalties in this tale about racism. Thankfully, Siegel and scriptwriter Nunnally Johnson do not lose focus. For the first and only time, Presley has no love interest. Here the trailers, again, were misleading, making it look as if a King was romantically entangled with a genie. Actually, Roslyn (Barbara Eden) is the &#8220;britches wearin&#8217;&#8221; girlfriend of brother Clint (Steve Forrest).The entire Burton family is caught up in divided loyalties, and racism is seen from all sides. Neddy is shunned by her Kiowa tribe for having married the white man, Sam (John McIntire). Smartly, the film opens, like John Ford&#8217;s The Searchers (1956), with an intimate look at the family, but it&#8217;s also a reason to show off Elvis singing. This is almost essential before the bleakness sets in.An Indian massacre follows, which will eventually take victims beyond that single incident. Although the Burtons do not excuse the brutality of the Kiowas, they also refuse to be willing victims of community resentment and demonization. Hostilities quickly make their way to Neddy, even from friends and extended family, such as Roslyn. When the town doctor refers to an injured Neddy as &#8220;that woman&#8221; Presley responds: &#8220;That woman? Don&#8217;t she got a name, like white people?&#8221; Poignantly delivered, it&#8217;s one of his best acting moments, .Flaming Star was shot on a modest budget, which is occasionally obvious (as in the day for night scenes). Siegel, as usual, is in his element with outdoor settings, regardless of funding constraints. Comparisons to The Searchers are inevitable, but while that film was grandiose (perhaps too much so), Flaming Star tells its smartly paced story in a far briefer running time, leaving no room for unnecessary distractions.* my review originally appeared at 366 weird movies",4,The high point of Presley's acting resume,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",2014,6673,"['Hollywood', '8217', 's', 'model',

267390,A3PD6WWOPKPLJ9,6301798074,"Wayne Engle ""Wayne Engle""","[0, 0]","I had not viewed ""Flaming Star"" for many years, until making its acquaintance again Thanksgiving Day at some friends' home after a delicious turkey dinner. Some of my memories of it were a bit distorted by the years, but I still found it a first-rate Western.Pacer Burton (Elvis) is the half-breed son of a White rancher (John McIntire) and an Indian woman (Delores Del Rio). Pacer's older brother, or rather half-brother, (Steve Forrest), is by the father's first marriage to a White woman, who died. Kiowa Indians in the area (the tribe of which Pacer's mother is a member) are attacking isolated White ranches and committing massacres to try to drive the Whites from what the Indians see as ""their"" land, stolen over time by the White settlers.Racial animosity on both sides quickly escalates, with Pacer and Mrs. Burton caught squarely in the middle. The film shows how Pacer is torn between his commitment to his family (composed of both Indians and Whites), and his racial attraction to the Kiowa tribesmen who try to get him to join their struggle. The film, which is heavily larded with great action scenes, winds up with two of the Burtons dead, and Pacer ""already killed, just looking for a place to die,"" in his own words.In our own politically-correct times, it would be tempting to watch ""Flaming Star"" and conclude, ""Those poor Indians! The evil, greedy White people stole their lands and left them with nothing! Who could blame them for fighting back?"" But the viewer needs to remember that land occupied by ethnic or racial groups for whatever period of time, is not registered on a warranty deed at some courthouse. To voice it in the simplest, least sentimental terms, land belongs to the tribe which is strong enough to take it, and hold it. The ancestors of the Kiowas themselves may well have driven some other, weaker tribe of people off the land in order to possess it, hundreds of years before. In ethnic and racial clashes such as the ones shown here, it's seldom that either side has clean hands.Pacer's dilemma leads me to this conclusion: Races of people are better off when they keep miscegenation to a bare minimum. People of mixed race often cannot decide just who they are, or who they are supposed to be, or which ""side"" they should take. Tragically, it's far too often a path to madness and death.",5,"Elvis' best, most thought-provoking movie",1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2331,"['had', 'not', 'viewed', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'many', 'years', 'making', 'acquaintance', 'again', 'Thanksgiving', 'Day', 'friends', 'home', 'delicious', 'turkey', 'dinner', 'memories', 'were', 'bit', 'distorted', 'years', 'still', 'found', 'first-rate', 'Western.Pacer', 'Burton', 'Elvis', 'half-breed', 'son', 'White', 'rancher', 'John', 'McIntire', 'Indian', 'woman', 'Delores', 'Del', 'Rio', 'Pacer', 'older', 'brother', 'rather', 'half-brother', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'father', 'first', 'marriage', 'White', 'woman', 'who', 'died', 'Kiowa', 'Indians', 'area', 'tribe', 'Pacer', 'mother', 'member', 'are', 'attacking', 'isolated', 'White', 'ranches', 'committing', 'massacres', 'try', 'drive', 'Whites', 'what', 'Indians', 'see', 'land', 'stolen', 'time', 'White', 'settlers.Racial', 'animosity', 'sides', 'quickly', 'escalates', 'Pacer', 'Mrs.', 'Burton', 'caught', 'squarely', 'middle', 'film', 'how', 'Pacer', 'torn', 'commitment', 'family', 'composed', 'Indians', 'Whites', 'racial', 'attraction', 'Kiowa', 'tribesmen', 'who', 'try', 'get', 'join', 'struggle', 'film', 'heavily', 'larded', 'great', 'action', 'scenes', 'up', 'two', 'Burtons', 'dead', 'Pacer', 'already', 'killed', 'just', 'looking', 'place', 'die', 'own', 'words.In', 'own', 'politically-correct', 'times', 'would', 'be', 'tempting', 'watch', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'conclude', 'poor', 'Indians', 'evil', 'greedy', 'White', 'people', 'stole', 'lands', 'left', 'nothing', 'Who', 'could', 'blame', 'fighting', 'back', 'viewer', 'remember', 'land', 'occupied', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'groups', 'period', 'time', 'not', 'registered', 'warranty', 'deed', 'courthouse', 'voice', 'simplest', 'least', 'sentimental', 'terms', 'land', 'belongs', 'tribe', 'strong', 'enough', 'take', 'hold', 'ancestors', 'Kiowas', 'may', 'well', 'have', 'driven', 'other', 'weaker', 'tribe', 'people', 'land', 'order', 'possess', 'hundreds', 'years', 'ethnic', 'racial', 'clashes', 'such', 'ones', 'shown', 'here', 'seldom', 'side', 'clean', 'hands.Pacer', 'dilemma', 'conclusion', 'Races', 'people', 'are', 'better', 'off', 'when', 'keep', 'miscegenation', 'bare', 'minimum', 'People', 'mixed', 'race', 'often', 'can', 'not', 'decide', 'just', 'who', 'are', 'who', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'side', 'should', 'take', 'Tragically', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'path', 'madness', 'death']",N/A
267391,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6301798074,Wuchak,"[0, 1]","""Flaming Star"" is a Western hailed as one of Elvis Presley's best serious-acting gigs. It came out in 1960 and was his 6th film in four years.Elvis stars as Pacer, a half-breed, living in the wilderness with his white father (John McIntire) & older brother (Steve Forrest) and Indian mother (Delores Del Rio). Barbara Eden is also on hand as a britches-wearing girl with eyes for Pacer's brother. Things get tense when a band of Kiowas starts attacking settlers and request Pacer's assistance.Aside from the title song over the credits, Elvis only sings one song near the beginning. Beyond that, this is a serious Western with flashes of tragic violence. It's worthwhile for Elvis fans and a few other worthy factors (great wilderness locations, Barbara Eden, etc.), but it's not really a good film.As a Western, ""Flaming Star"" has too much of what made Westerns in general laughable before the 60s. There are many exceptions, like ""The Last Wagon"" from 1956, but -- generally speaking -- the downside of Westerns before the 60s include contrived plot elements, an unrealistic vibe, bad music, white actors playing Natives and dumb Indian dialogue. ""Flaming Star"" is guilty on at least three of these counts.As far as contrived plot elements go, there are just too many ""Yeah, right"" moments. For instance the guy who survives the Indian raid and hides out in a hole in the desert for days, half-dead and half-mad, just waiting to be used to move along the story. Or the scene where Pacer and his brother threaten a little girl to attain the services of the town's doctor -- they let the girl go BEFORE taking the doctor. Why would the doctor go with them if the girl was no longer in danger? Why wouldn't the town's people attack them once the girl is freed? Or the two cowboys who seek hospitality at Pacer's ranch, would ANYONE really be that rude and savage to two people kindly offering them help, half-breed or not? Bad scripting like this just takes the viewer right out of the story.The white actors in Indian roles present a huge problem visually. How could anyone assume Pacer is an Indian since he looks (and dresses and sings) exactly like a white dude, not to mention the other Indians. Delores Del Rio looks more Hispanic than Native, why assume she's an Indian? Despite this, the Natives are portrayed fairly realistically. What kills it is the lame dialogue they're stuck with, words & phrasing that would make Tonto proud. I couldn't help mimicking such lingo with my wife after the film: ""Me Chiefy Wiefy go to front room to listen to pleasant noise while moon lodge high in sky"" (lol). At least ""Flaming Star"" is entertaining in this respect, it's just not the kind of entertainment the filmmakers intended.If you want to catch a great Western from the same period check out Marlon Brando's ""One-Eyed Jacks [Slim Case],"" released in 1961. It's the seminal 60's Western and far superior to most of the Spaghetti Westerns it influenced. What's really interesting is that Brando was originally supposed to play the role of Pacer in ""Flaming Star"" and the script was later rewritten for Elvis. Marlon, thankfully, chose to invest his time, money and talents into the making of ""One-Eyed Jacks.""""Flaming Star"" was shot in Utah and Thousand Oaks, California, and runs 92 minutes (but seems longer, in a bad way).BOTTOM LINE: ""Flaming Star"" is worthwhile for Presley fans and a few other factors. It's got a good, serious vibe and is sometimes violent; it also has great wilderness locations. But it's shackled by most of the things that made Westerns eye-rolling experiences before the 60s and 70s (not that all Westerns in the modern era are good, of course). You could sum it up as a curious Elvis-led period piece.GRADE: C-",3,Me write review before moon kills yellow orb in sky,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,3739,"['Flaming', 'Star', 'Western', 'hailed', 'one', 'Elvis', 'Presley', 'best', 'serious-acting', 'gigs', 'came', 'out', '1960', 'was', '6th', 'film', 'four', 'years.Elvis', 'stars', 'Pacer', 'half-breed', 'living', 'wilderness', 'white', 'father', 'John', 'McIntire', 'older', 'brother', 'Steve', 'Forrest', 'Indian', 'mother', 'Delores', 'Del', 'Rio', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'also', 'hand', 'britches-wearing', 'girl', 'eyes', 'Pacer', 'brother', 'Things', 'get', 'tense', 'when', 'band', 'Kiowas', 'attacking', 'settlers', 'request', 'Pacer', 'assistance.Aside', 'title', 'song', 'credits', 'Elvis', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'beginning', 'Beyond', 'serious', 'Western', 'flashes', 'tragic', 'violence', 'worthwhile', 'Elvis', 'fans', 'few', 'other', 'worthy', 'factors', 'great', 'wilderness', 'locations', 'Barbara', 'Eden', 'etc', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'film.As', 'Western', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'too', 'much', 'what', 'made', 'Westerns', 'general', 'laughable', '60s', 'are', 'many', 'exceptions', 'Last', 'Wagon', '1956', 'generally', 'speaking', 'downside', 'Westerns', '60s', 'include', 'contrived', 'plot', 'elements', 'unrealistic', 'vibe', 'bad', 'music', 'white', 'actors', 'playing', 'Natives', 'dumb', 'Indian', 'dialogue', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'guilty', 'least', 'three', 'counts.As', 'far', 'contrived', 'plot', 'elements', 'go', 'are', 'just', 'too', 'many', 'Yeah', 'right', 'moments', 'instance', 'guy', 'who', 'Indian', 'raid', 'out', 'hole', 'desert', 'days', 'half-dead', 'half-mad', 'just', 'waiting', 'be', 'used', 'move', 'story', 'scene', 'where', 'Pacer', 'brother', 'threaten', 'little', 'girl', 'attain', 'services', 'town', 'doctor', 'let', 'girl', 'go', 'taking', 'doctor', 'Why', 'would', 'doctor', 'go', 'girl', 'was', 'longer', 'danger', 'Why', 'would', ""n't"", 'town', 'people', 'attack', 'once', 'girl', 'freed', 'two', 'cowboys', 'who', 'seek', 'hospitality', 'Pacer', 'ranch', 'would', 'ANYONE', 'really', 'be', 'rude', 'savage', 'two', 'people', 'kindly', 'offering', 'help', 'half-breed', 'not', 'Bad', 'scripting', 'just', 'viewer', 'right', 'story.The', 'white', 'actors', 'Indian', 'roles', 'present', 'huge', 'problem', 'visually', 'How', 'could', 'anyone', 'assume', 'Pacer', 'Indian', 'dresses', 'sings', 'exactly', 'white', 'dude', 'not', 'mention', 'other', 'Indians', 'Delores', 'Del', 'Rio', 'more', 'Hispanic', 'Native', 'why', 'assume', 'Indian', 'Natives', 'are', 'portrayed', 'fairly', 'realistically', 'What', 'lame', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'words', 'phrasing', 'would', 'make', 'Tonto', 'proud', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'mimicking', 'such', 'lingo', 'wife', 'film', 'Me', 'Chiefy', 'Wiefy', 'go', 'front', 'room', 'listen', 'pleasant', 'noise', 'moon', 'lodge', 'high', 'sky', 'lol', 'least', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'entertaining', 'respect', 'just', 'not', 'kind', 'entertainment', 'filmmakers', 'intended.If', 'want', 'catch', 'great', 'Western', 'same', 'period', 'check', 'out', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'One-Eyed', 'Jacks', '[', 'Slim', 'Case', ']', 'released', '1961', 'seminal', '60', 'Western', 'far', 'superior', 'most', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'influenced', 'What', 'really', 'interesting', 'Brando', 'was', 'originally', 'supposed', 'play', 'role', 'Pacer', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'script', 'was', 'later', 'rewritten', 'Elvis', 'Marlon', 'thankfully', 'chose', 'invest', 'time', 'money', 'talents', 'making', 'One-Eyed', 'Jacks', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'was', 'shot', 'Utah', 'Thousand', 'Oaks', 'California', '92', 'minutes', 'longer', 'bad', 'way', '.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Flaming', 'Star', 'worthwhile', 'Presley', 'fans', 'few', 'other', 'factors', 'got', 'good', 'serious', 'vibe', 'sometimes', 'violent', 'also', 'great', 'wilderness', 'locations', 'shackled', 'most', 'things', 'made', 'Westerns', 'eye-rolling', 'experiences', '60s', '70s', 'not', 'Westerns', 'modern', 'era', 'are', 'good', 'course', 'could', 'sum', 'up', 'curious', 'Elvis-led', 'period', 'piece.GRADE', 'C-']",N/A
