1270928,A1DRKVXO300RUE,B002IW8V04,Amazon Customer,"[8, 9]","I enjoyed this movie. In short, its the story of a new couple, an American girl and her Chinese husband, who travel to China to meet his parents. They travel during the feast of the 7th moon, and find that the Chinese belief in ghouls that come out on this holiday is true. No spoiler here, check out the box cover. While en route in a taxi to the parents, the couple finds themselves abandoned in an obscure, remote village, then scary things start.Ultimately, this was very well done.  I tend not to enjoy Asian horror at all, but this was an interesting hybrid.  It was a chinese story told with an american female lead, and a story that is consistent with western horror concepts. The mood was creepy throughout, particularly at the end when she makes a certain journey. This journey (trying to avoid spoilers here) was particularly effective in its horror element; she takes a walk that has the potential to turn deadly at any moment, and the suspense was great.  Further, the movie evolves just slowly enough; it takes a while to understand what is going on, and once you do, the heat turns up.  Good acting, good concept, and high production values.

Seventh Moon is actually a pretty darn cool movie.It's about a couple who visit China, and eventually they find themselves running for their lives as they must avoid all kinds of demonic creatures.What absolutely FLOORS me is how incredibly effective the suspense is.  It's so good (perhaps because it really takes advantage of the Chinese culture) that I can't help but completely fall in love with the film as a result.When you see, for example, the couple running through fields while hearing the crickets in the background, there's definitely a very eerie atmosphere taking place.  The demonic creatures themselves are just part of the fun- the suspense completely floors me.This is what makes it so hard to join in with everyone else and hate this movie- the high amounts of noticeable suspense.Sure, the majority of the storytelling takes place in dark areas (and in some cases, REALLY dark areas to the point you can barely view anything) but it's usually not dark enough that you can't tell what's going on.  The storytelling flows pretty nicely too.Darn this is one creepy movie.  I seriously love it to pieces and highly recommend it to fans who love the Grudge in particular.

The two try to find help in a neighboring village, but they are hunted by a pale-faced pack of ravening creatures in the night. BLAIR WITCH PROJECT co-creator Eduardo Sanchez helms this chilling Chinese ghost story with a surprising amount of atmosphere and suspense. Sanchez sets an oppressive mood through the use of his voyeuristic shooting style, subtle score, and jarring sound effects. The creatures are kept just out of focus throughout the adrenaline-fueled chase sequences in order to drive home the terror without spoiling the shocks in the end. Each of the scares are expertly timed to maximize the effect when the audience is least suspecting another assault on the senses. Amy Smart and Tim Chiou have a genuine chemistry on-screen that makes it easy to bond and relate to them in a pair of strong performances. The final scenes are also the most beautiful and frightening, although the underexposure of the film makes it extremely difficult to see much of the action.

The second major problem was that most of the action in the film was in almost complete darkness.  It was so dark that you could barely make out anything.  What a waste of film.  You would have thought after they shot a roll or so of film, they would have realized it was just too dark and would have re-shot that portion and used more light in future shooting.  Nope.  It never gets any lighter.  Could have been a great horror film if you could have seen what was happening.  Also the ending was so ambiguous that it was impossible to figure out what actually happened.  A complete and total waste of time.  Not even as good as Blair Witch Project, which I hated.

1270932,A2IY9M330NKBW6,B002IW8V04,Eric Sanberg,"[3, 4]","I rented this movie because of the director's previous efforts. I liked Blair Witch enough (though somehow I haven't had the urge to see it again) but something about Altered really got to me. I thought ""this guy can go places if he keeps this up."" Well....this effort I liked for the most part but some of the previous reviewers, particularly Phillip Perron, were astute in pointing out the films flaws.When the movie started I was about as impressed as I could be. I liked the filming. The dialogue sounded very natural to me and it did manage to build tension. The story of the newlywed mixed couple (him Chinese, her Anglo) on their honeymoon in China, who find themselves engulfed in a Chinese myth come to life, unfolded in a very realizable fashion. There were a lot of small devices, both seen and heard, that helped build the sense of terror and dread. I also felt it a wise decision to show the demons as near nondescript blurs running at a quick pace through the reeds.As things progressed however the film started to break down. I wasn't as perturbed by the hand held camera as other viewers seemed to be, but it did get too dark and what was good dialogue in the beginning nearly disappeared as the film progressed. I don't want to say the story fell apart at the end but it just didn't do the first half justice.This is by no means a bad movie and is well worth look for fans of the genre. I liked it more than most horror movies I've seen (and I've seen my share), but I doubt it will ever reach classic status. I do hope the director keeps going and honing his craft.

Much like constipation, this movie is a ton of effort that ends up with some blood, a convulsion or two, considerable pain, and a resolution of bewilderment.Newlyweds honeymooning in China, Yul (Tim Chiou) and Melissa (Amy Smart) are planning to visit Yul's relatives during Hungry Ghost Festival, a bizarre ritual similar to our Halloween - seemingly more serious - when superstitions submit that evil spirits are released from hell during the seventh moon of the Chinese calendar to chow down on live offerings.  Maybe it's actually more like a Chinese Thanksgiving instead of Halloween.  Anyway, their tour guide Ping (Dennis Chan) gets lost and strands them in a remote rural village.  It's up to them to survive a night that makes the superstitions all too real.Unfortunately, this interesting setup full of intrigue as well as historical and cultural significance is completely squandered by incompetent direction, atrocious camerawork, and amateur cinematography.  Given my belief that The Blair Witch Project is unprocessed horse manure, I should have known going in that I wouldn't like this film.  Director Eduardo Sanchez is milking that cow for all it is worth, and he managed to ensnare Amy Smart on his way towards regrettable memories and wasted time.  What was a promising setup quickly and completely unravels by the time it gets to the third act.  Stupefying choices abound.  As for the filming itself, simply put, cinematographer Way-Chuen Lam should not be allowed on a movie set and film editors Michael Cronin and Johnny Rice should be restricted from developing film, much less editing it.  The majority of the movie is shaky-cam overload, and when it's stationary the choices made are unimaginably bad.  Blurred vision, bouncing ball movements, ""nose hair counting""-close-ups, and a chase scene that felt like looking out of the car window while driving on the autobahn are only the tip of the iceberg, because the darkness of this film could sink the Titanic.  During one portion of the movie Amy Smart is spelunking, I presume, but it's so dark that I thought someone pulled a Tyler Durden and slipped in a colonoscopy video between frames.  Yes, I just compared the very cute Amy Smart to a turd.  It comes as no surprise that Cronin's job following Seventh Moon was ""My Big Redneck Wedding.""  Probably pro bono work for a relative.Aside from a few audio and visual scares, a startling ""what the F just crossed the road""-scene, and the always enjoyable Amy Smart, there's just too much wrong with this film, particularly the camerawork, to give it a recommendation.

Only in the sense that they picked it up for distribution, and after seeing it I have no idea why anyone would want to distribute this flick. I was looking forward to a film set in China that would deal with gods and demons from that culture, but what I got was a mishmash of half thought out ideas that broke down into  another run and scream fest. With a lot more script work and a better director there could have been something here. I rarely give out only 2 stars, but this only really deserves 'em. Hey Sam, choose your Ghost House films a little more carefully. There are good independent flix out there looking for distributors. Have you ever met Maurice Devereaux?Plotwise we have a young couple on their honeymoon in mainland China where husband Yul's family still lives, and he thinks it would be a great idea to kill two birds with one metaphorical stone and use this trip to introduce his new kwailo wife to the folks. Their  visit coincides with the Hungry Ghost Festival which occurs in the month of the seventh full moon when, according to legend, all the dead are released from hell and return to earth. After a day spent enjoying the festival in the city their guide loads his drunken charges into a car and they all head out into the country in the general direction of Yul's relatives. They never get there of course.The acting is adequate for a film of this type. It's always nice to see an Asian male (Tim Chiou as Yul) in a leading role even though you know he'll probably bite the dust since this is the era of the woman-surving-against-all-odds cliche, and Amy Smart as his young wife Mel runs and screams and cries with the best of them. Eduardo Sanchez's direction is uninspired--but with a script like this who would be? That script, the less said the better. Oy!  All the critical action takes place at night obviously and I advise you to have the asprin right next to you because you're gonna need it for the eyestrain headache this ill-lit flick is going to leave you with.

Stone,"[3, 8]","Unlike the 3 sets of the ""Eight Films to Die For"" which have been universally terrible, the first set of 8 films from Ghosthouse Underground was pretty good. It contained a couple of classics. ""Dance of the Dead"" is one of the best Zombie movies I've ever seen, and ""Rise of the Reeker"" was a worthy followup to the original ""Reeker"". I can even forgive them for ""Dark Floors"" which was a really bad ninety minute promo for a terrible heavy metal band. This time out, they have only come up with 4 titles - perhaps because of the economy, or more likely because they couldn't find 8 good ones. I was s bit concerned when I watched the trailer, as I found that the film was directed by the guy who did the over-hyped and overrated pile of garbage known as ""The Blair Witch Project."" That was one of the worst films I have ever had to suffer through in a movie theater. Now I can add to it this mess, which is one of the worst movies I have ever had to sit through at home. The minimal plot involves some kind of nonsense that happens in China during the full moon of the seventh month of the year. A honeymooning couple (including Amy Smart who really should know better - but then again, she allowed herself to be thoroughly embarrassed in not one but 2 ""Crank"" movies - guilty pleasures for me, but potentially career-ending for her) is stranded near a strange town when their tour guide disappears. There's a lot of running around, fighting, rolling around on the ground, escaping, getting caught again, more running, etc. Most of the film was so dark and shot so poorly that it wasn't even always clear who was rolling around on the ground or why. There's a minor plot twist (that should have been obvious to anyone with half a brain), and then thankfully after only about an hour and fifteen minutes, the long credits start. It's too bad this was shot so poorly, because in the ""making of"" featurette, it looked like there may have been some pretty cool makeup used on the ghosts. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time with this one.

1270943,A1CKY01WDLN1DK,B002IW8V04,M. Zveris,"[1, 3]","This movie could have been so very good, instead it was so very, very, incredibly bad.  It is really painful to watch this film.  When you want to film at night, or make it appear as if it is night, you should still (as the watcher) be able to see something of what is going on for the most part.  Unless of course it's for thematic reasons that we are plunged into darkness which was not the case with Seventh Moon.  The movie was just badly filmed, there's no if, and, or but about it.The plot was really interesting, for the third of the movie where they stuck with it.  A honeymooning couple is in China, enjoying the countryside and the festival of the seventh moon.  They are enjoying the local sights and culture, and planning on visiting the new husband's family that still lives in the country.  Their driver/guide is supposed to be driving them off to their family when they fall asleep on the long drive and awaken to find themselves in the middle of proverbial nowhere outside of a small town.  The driver makes several cryptic remarks and goes off to find some help, stating that he has become lost.  Enter the spookiness.The couple realize (the husband was still asleep until woken) that they are alone and a great period of time has passed, they exit their vehicle and travel through this town calling out for their driver.  The streets are empty; the houses appear to all be blockaded.  The ominous atmosphere is palpable in these scenes, especially when they come across a strange scene of animals from the Chinese Zodiac secured as if for sacrifice in the middle of the town.  Things get even eerier when they return to their car to find it covered in blood, as if to lure some form of wild animal.Secure in the knowledge that they should get the heck out of dodge they drive off, and now is where the poor filming really starts to annoy you.  I'm not going to delve deeper into the plot except to say that the movie takes a huge nose dive about halfway through.  It's as if they decided that the suspense they had been building wasn't worth it; let's just take a detour into magical cult happy land.  It killed the entire film to me.  I was left staring at my screen with an incredulous expression.  The ending was especially ridiculous and typical to the American Horror genre.I had high hopes for this movie, not coming into it but because of the opening.  I was really impressed with the buildup and happy because the tension and eerie nature of the entire situation the main characters are put in was different from the typical ghost/zombie/undead horde flick.  Unfortunately the film takes a massive 180 degree turn from what could have been a suspenseful and dramatic horror into a very typical, easily predictable, trite tale.  It took this movie from a two to a one star, because it was like watching the director throw away all the potential of Seventh Moon in favor for what might ""sell"" to the horror audience.  Once you add in the filming and how ridiculously dark many of the scenes are (and clearly not intentionally) it's unwatchable.",1,Depressingly Poor Horror Movie,1306800000,"05 31, 2011",2011,3068,"['movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'very', 'good', 'instead', 'was', 'so', 'very', 'very', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'really', 'painful', 'watch', 'film', 'When', 'want', 'film', 'night', 'make', 'appear', 'night', 'should', 'still', 'watcher', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'something', 'what', 'going', 'most', 'part', 'course', 'thematic', 'reasons', 'are', 'plunged', 'darkness', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'Seventh', 'Moon', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'badly', 'filmed', 'it.The', 'plot', 'was', 'really', 'interesting', 'third', 'movie', 'where', 'stuck', 'honeymooning', 'couple', 'China', 'enjoying', 'countryside', 'festival', 'seventh', 'moon', 'are', 'enjoying', 'local', 'sights', 'culture', 'planning', 'visiting', 'new', 'husband', 'family', 'still', 'country', 'driver/guide', 'supposed', 'be', 'driving', 'family', 'when', 'fall', 'asleep', 'long', 'drive', 'awaken', 'find', 'middle', 'proverbial', 'nowhere', 'small', 'town', 'driver', 'several', 'cryptic', 'remarks', 'off', 'find', 'help', 'stating', 'become', 'lost', 'Enter', 'spookiness.The', 'couple', 'realize', 'husband', 'was', 'still', 'asleep', 'woken', 'are', 'alone', 'great', 'period', 'time', 'passed', 'exit', 'vehicle', 'travel', 'town', 'calling', 'out', 'driver', 'streets', 'are', 'empty', 'houses', 'appear', 'be', 'blockaded', 'ominous', 'atmosphere', 'palpable', 'scenes', 'especially', 'when', 'come', 'strange', 'scene', 'animals', 'Chinese', 'Zodiac', 'secured', 'sacrifice', 'middle', 'town', 'Things', 'get', 'even', 'eerier', 'when', 'return', 'car', 'find', 'covered', 'blood', 'lure', 'form', 'wild', 'animal.Secure', 'knowledge', 'should', 'get', 'heck', 'dodge', 'drive', 'off', 'now', 'where', 'poor', 'filming', 'really', 'annoy', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'delve', 'deeper', 'plot', 'say', 'movie', 'huge', 'nose', 'dive', 'halfway', 'decided', 'suspense', 'had', 'been', 'building', 'was', ""n't"", 'worth', 'let', 'just', 'take', 'detour', 'magical', 'cult', 'happy', 'land', 'killed', 'entire', 'film', 'was', 'left', 'staring', 'screen', 'incredulous', 'expression', 'ending', 'was', 'especially', 'ridiculous', 'typical', 'American', 'Horror', 'genre.I', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'movie', 'not', 'coming', 'opening', 'was', 'really', 'impressed', 'buildup', 'happy', 'tension', 'eerie', 'nature', 'entire', 'situation', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'put', 'was', 'different', 'typical', 'ghost/zombie/undead', 'horde', 'flick', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'massive', '180', 'degree', 'turn', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'suspenseful', 'dramatic', 'horror', 'very', 'typical', 'easily', 'predictable', 'trite', 'tale', 'took', 'movie', 'two', 'one', 'star', 'was', 'watching', 'director', 'throw', 'away', 'potential', 'Seventh', 'Moon', 'favor', 'what', 'might', 'sell', 'horror', 'audience', 'add', 'filming', 'how', 'ridiculously', 'dark', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'clearly', 'not', 'intentionally', 'unwatchable']",N/A

It isn't long before they get caught in the middle of a ritual involving some demonic creatures that look like rejects from The Descent.

1270945,A1NKJJCBBYVP4V,B002IW8V04,"Philip C. Perron ""Philip""","[27, 30]","Ghosthouse released eight films the prior year (similar to the horrorfest releases) and a handful of them were very good or simply wierd and therefore good as a result.  I purchased and chose them based off reviews from various horror sights.  This year, ghosthouse again has released a few flicks (four actually) and this was rated the second best out of the group.  With its star of Amy Smart, cool box cover, and one of the two directors/writers of the Blair Witch film (Ed Sanchez), I picked it up on sale first week of release.  Sanchez did a pretty decent film called Altered a few years back so I hoped this one would be as good.The first half of the film we find out our couple are on their honeymoon in China.  The husband's family was/is of Chinese ancestry and he has various family still there.  During their time there, a festival of the seventh moon is occurring in which superstition says that the dead are freed from hell on the seventh full moon of the year.  As with our Halloween, this festival is a bit similar though more a fair/carnival feel.  Anyways, after their fun in the city they head out with their tour guide to the rural section of China to visit the husband's relatives.  The trip takes much longer than expected and by the time the tour guide gets lost, it is already dark as night and out in the farms/hills of rolling China, there are no street lights.  Eventually they come to a darkened village and the tour guide decides to go ask one of the town folk where they are.  This is the beginning of the setup for our movie.So far so good, right?  Well, unfortunately problems begin on three levels.  The first and foremost is the camera.  The entire film is filmed with a shakey-cam which can sometimes work (see Mulberry Street, Blair Witch, Cloverfield, etc.) but here it is horrible.  And there is a reason!  Because of the second major problem of this film:  night filming.  The entire film is in complete darkness.  We do not have the filmed at dusk and then digitally darkening the film.  Nor do we have night filming with backlighting.  It is supposed to be full moon and yet still, no light.  With a shaky cam and complete darkness, it is disorienting and terribly hard to follow a lot of the film.  This really ruined the enjoyment factor of the film for me.The third and final fault was the last third of the screenplay.  It was not written well at all and we get some sequences that may or may not be dream sequences, that end up causing almost as much confusion for the viewer as the darkness/shakey-cam, and bring complete hault to what was a very suspenseful and action oriented mystery-horror flick.Though the camera and darkness ruined a lot of the enjoyment, the story was pretty good and had its shocks and scares.  The rural part of China and the items used to make suspense worked unbelievabley well (""what was that in the street"", a gong like windchime (similar to a church bell), animals crying in the darkness, etc.)  But then this grinding halt in the screenplay and what turned out to be a somewhat sappy ending made this film simply mediocre.  I really wanted to love this film but unfortunately I only enjoyed it.  Is it worth seeing, sure, but don't get your hopes up.  Enjoy it for what it is:  a technically flawed film with a mediocre third act that had a lot of promise in its rolling hills and its rural village in a far away land, a supernatural occurrance, no where to run/hide, and a nightmare of a night for a young American couple.",2,Potentially a GREAT film falls flat,1255046400,"10 9, 2009",2009,3502,"['Ghosthouse', 'released', 'eight', 'films', 'prior', 'year', 'similar', 'horrorfest', 'releases', 'handful', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'simply', 'wierd', 'therefore', 'good', 'result', 'purchased', 'chose', 'based', 'off', 'reviews', 'various', 'horror', 'sights', 'year', 'ghosthouse', 'again', 'released', 'few', 'flicks', 'four', 'actually', 'was', 'rated', 'second', 'best', 'group', 'star', 'Amy', 'Smart', 'cool', 'box', 'cover', 'one', 'two', 'directors/writers', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'film', 'Ed', 'Sanchez', 'picked', 'up', 'sale', 'first', 'week', 'release', 'Sanchez', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'film', 'called', 'Altered', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'so', 'hoped', 'one', 'would', 'be', 'good.The', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'couple', 'are', 'honeymoon', 'China', 'husband', 'family', 'was/is', 'Chinese', 'ancestry', 'various', 'family', 'still', 'there', 'time', 'there', 'festival', 'seventh', 'moon', 'occurring', 'superstition', 'dead', 'are', 'freed', 'hell', 'seventh', 'full', 'moon', 'year', 'Halloween', 'festival', 'bit', 'similar', 'more', 'fair/carnival', 'feel', 'Anyways', 'fun', 'city', 'head', 'tour', 'guide', 'rural', 'section', 'China', 'visit', 'husband', 'relatives', 'trip', 'much', 'longer', 'expected', 'time', 'tour', 'guide', 'lost', 'already', 'dark', 'night', 'farms/hills', 'rolling', 'China', 'are', 'street', 'lights', 'Eventually', 'come', 'darkened', 'village', 'tour', 'guide', 'go', 'ask', 'one', 'town', 'folk', 'where', 'are', 'beginning', 'setup', 'movie.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'right', 'Well', 'unfortunately', 'problems', 'begin', 'three', 'levels', 'first', 'foremost', 'camera', 'entire', 'film', 'filmed', 'shakey-cam', 'can', 'sometimes', 'work', 'see', 'Mulberry', 'Street', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Cloverfield', 'etc', 'here', 'horrible', 'reason', 'second', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'night', 'filming', 'entire', 'film', 'complete', 'darkness', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'filmed', 'dusk', 'then', 'digitally', 'darkening', 'film', 'do', 'have', 'night', 'filming', 'backlighting', 'supposed', 'be', 'full', 'moon', 'yet', 'still', 'light', 'shaky', 'cam', 'complete', 'darkness', 'disorienting', 'terribly', 'hard', 'follow', 'lot', 'film', 'really', 'ruined', 'enjoyment', 'factor', 'film', 'me.The', 'third', 'final', 'fault', 'was', 'last', 'third', 'screenplay', 'was', 'not', 'written', 'well', 'get', 'sequences', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'dream', 'sequences', 'end', 'up', 'causing', 'almost', 'much', 'confusion', 'viewer', 'darkness/shakey-cam', 'bring', 'complete', 'hault', 'what', 'was', 'very', 'suspenseful', 'action', 'oriented', 'mystery-horror', 'camera', 'darkness', 'ruined', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'story', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'had', 'shocks', 'scares', 'rural', 'part', 'China', 'items', 'used', 'make', 'suspense', 'worked', 'unbelievabley', 'well', 'what', 'was', 'street', 'gong', 'windchime', 'similar', 'church', 'bell', 'animals', 'crying', 'darkness', 'etc', 'then', 'grinding', 'halt', 'screenplay', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'somewhat', 'sappy', 'ending', 'made', 'film', 'simply', 'mediocre', 'really', 'wanted', 'love', 'film', 'unfortunately', 'only', 'enjoyed', 'worth', 'seeing', 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'Enjoy', 'what', 'technically', 'flawed', 'film', 'mediocre', 'third', 'act', 'had', 'lot', 'promise', 'rolling', 'hills', 'rural', 'village', 'far', 'away', 'land', 'supernatural', 'occurrance', 'where', 'run/hide', 'nightmare', 'night', 'young', 'American', 'couple']",N/A

1270948,A1IN0ZW0794UE1,B002IW8V04,Shawn Carroll,"[1, 3]","When this movie came out, I was genuinely hopeful.  The concept of hungry ghosts is a central part of the tradition of Chinese Ancestor Worship, and had great potential for an excellent movie melding the supernatural and horror.  The script writers even set it during an actual event in the Chinese year, a festival sharing much in common with the true traditions of All Hallows Eve. Unfortunately, that is as far as it went.The film does not make the error that many movies make substituting gore for horror.  There is enough blood to add to the suspense, and increase the tension that is central to this kind of movie.  The script is serviceable.  The protagonists never engage in the typical ""how could they be so stupid"" stereotypes of a true horror film.  Their actions, at times foolish, were consistent with their characters as urban Americans enjoying their honeymoon in an exotic land.  The actions of the other characters in the film are similarly plausible.The problem is that the movie never really comes together.  You vaguely like the young couple, and that's about it.  You respect the actions of the only other real player in the movie towards the end, but I doubt he even has a total of ten minutes of screen time.  The monsters are scary, and appropriately monstrous.  None of this is the makings of great cinema.My wife, upon the conclusion of the movie, asked me ""What's the Point?""  She meant it rhetorically, because we both had no trouble understanding what was going on during the movie.  Yet that comment sums up succinctly my own reaction upon watching it.  It wasn't a waste of 87 minutes of my life, and since the rental was free I don't feel ripped off.  It's just very sad when this had the potential to be a very good movie.",2,"A Mediocre Supernatural/Horror Movie - or ""What's the Point""",1255824000,"10 18, 2009",2009,1755,"['When', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'genuinely', 'hopeful', 'concept', 'hungry', 'ghosts', 'central', 'part', 'tradition', 'Chinese', 'Ancestor', 'Worship', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'excellent', 'movie', 'melding', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'script', 'writers', 'even', 'set', 'actual', 'event', 'Chinese', 'year', 'festival', 'sharing', 'much', 'common', 'true', 'traditions', 'Hallows', 'Eve', 'Unfortunately', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'error', 'many', 'movies', 'make', 'substituting', 'gore', 'horror', 'enough', 'blood', 'add', 'suspense', 'increase', 'tension', 'central', 'kind', 'movie', 'script', 'serviceable', 'protagonists', 'never', 'engage', 'typical', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'so', 'stupid', 'stereotypes', 'true', 'horror', 'film', 'actions', 'times', 'foolish', 'were', 'consistent', 'characters', 'urban', 'Americans', 'enjoying', 'honeymoon', 'exotic', 'land', 'actions', 'other', 'characters', 'film', 'are', 'similarly', 'plausible.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'never', 'really', 'together', 'vaguely', 'young', 'couple', 'respect', 'actions', 'only', 'other', 'real', 'player', 'movie', 'end', 'doubt', 'even', 'total', 'ten', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'monsters', 'are', 'scary', 'appropriately', 'monstrous', 'None', 'makings', 'great', 'cinema.My', 'wife', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'asked', 'What', 'Point', 'meant', 'rhetorically', 'had', 'trouble', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'comment', 'sums', 'up', 'succinctly', 'own', 'reaction', 'watching', 'was', ""n't"", 'waste', '87', 'minutes', 'life', 'rental', 'was', 'free', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ripped', 'off', 'just', 'very', 'sad', 'when', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

Upon seeing this film at my local store I decided to give it a try.  Past Ghosthouse films have had a wide range of delivery in my opinion.  Some of these films can range from good and scary, to more bland and cliche resulting in no scares and a tediously drawn out and complicated story.  Well I was quite surprised with ""Seventh Moon"".The story takes place in China, where a couple is spending their honeymoon together.  They hear about a cultural practice and learn about what happens during the full moon of the seventh lunar month.  They are told that the dead are free to roam the Earth on this day and sacrifices must be made to please the spirits.  This holiday is actually culturally correct.  It is called ""The Ghost Festival"" and occurs on the 15th night of the seventh lunar month in China.  This celebration is also known as ""Ghost Day"" and citizens of China actually believe that their deceased relatives are free to return to Earth for this one day, much like the Mexican tradition known as ""Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead)"".  This film builds upon that concept of the dead returning, but elaborates into also suggesting that demons are free to roam the Earth as well.Focusing on the newly wed couple, the film depicts how desperate the two become when face to face with the moon demons.  It seems as if everywhere the couple turns, the demons are close behind, and with none of the locals willing to lend a helping hand, the couple must fight for survival on their own.  The story progresses from a large city to a small field and ends at a cemetery/monastery building.  The wide variety of scenery is well done and the acting is top notch, allowing you to feel the terror that the people feel when being attacked by ""Moon Demons"".During the first 20 minutes of the film, I was not able to view anything.  Initially, I found the image was too dark, seeing how the majority of the filming was done in complete darkness, thus not allowing the audience to view the action, or even the actors on screen.  I solved this problem by switching my TV's contrast to a more optimal setting and was able to see everything 100%.  Once this problem was corrected, I simply restarted the film using the brighter screen resolution, and the film was much easier to view, and was much more enjoyable as well.  So, with that problem solved I was able to fully enjoy watching the film and must say that I really enjoyed it once I was able to actually view it.The story was great, the thrills were decent, and the acting and environment was spectacular.  If you are a fan of horror films I believe you will enjoy this movie, just make sure you change your TVs viewing settings to a preset contrast with brighter resolution and you'll be fine.",4,"A Few Good Scares, An Overall Good Film",1262649600,"01 5, 2010",2010,2822,"['Being', 'major', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'am', 'always', 'looking', 'expand', 'collection', 'seeing', 'film', 'local', 'store', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'Past', 'Ghosthouse', 'films', 'have', 'had', 'wide', 'range', 'delivery', 'opinion', 'films', 'can', 'range', 'good', 'scary', 'more', 'bland', 'cliche', 'resulting', 'scares', 'tediously', 'drawn', 'out', 'complicated', 'story', 'Well', 'was', 'quite', 'surprised', 'Seventh', 'Moon', '.The', 'story', 'place', 'China', 'where', 'couple', 'spending', 'honeymoon', 'together', 'hear', 'cultural', 'practice', 'learn', 'what', 'full', 'moon', 'seventh', 'lunar', 'month', 'are', 'told', 'dead', 'are', 'free', 'roam', 'Earth', 'day', 'sacrifices', 'must', 'be', 'made', 'please', 'spirits', 'holiday', 'actually', 'culturally', 'correct', 'called', 'Ghost', 'Festival', '15th', 'night', 'seventh', 'lunar', 'month', 'China', 'celebration', 'also', 'known', 'Ghost', 'Day', 'citizens', 'China', 'actually', 'believe', 'deceased', 'relatives', 'are', 'free', 'return', 'Earth', 'one', 'day', 'much', 'Mexican', 'tradition', 'known', 'Dia', 'de', 'los', 'Muertos', 'Day', 'Dead', 'film', 'concept', 'dead', 'returning', 'also', 'suggesting', 'demons', 'are', 'free', 'roam', 'Earth', 'well.Focusing', 'newly', 'wed', 'couple', 'film', 'how', 'desperate', 'two', 'become', 'when', 'face', 'face', 'moon', 'demons', 'couple', 'demons', 'are', 'close', 'none', 'locals', 'willing', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'couple', 'must', 'fight', 'survival', 'own', 'story', 'large', 'city', 'small', 'field', 'cemetery/monastery', 'building', 'wide', 'variety', 'scenery', 'well', 'done', 'acting', 'top', 'notch', 'allowing', 'feel', 'terror', 'people', 'feel', 'when', 'being', 'attacked', 'Moon', 'Demons', '.During', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'able', 'view', 'anything', 'Initially', 'found', 'image', 'was', 'too', 'dark', 'seeing', 'how', 'majority', 'filming', 'was', 'done', 'complete', 'darkness', 'thus', 'not', 'allowing', 'audience', 'view', 'action', 'even', 'actors', 'screen', 'solved', 'problem', 'switching', 'TV', 'contrast', 'more', 'optimal', 'setting', 'was', 'able', 'see', 'everything', '100', '%', 'Once', 'problem', 'was', 'corrected', 'simply', 'restarted', 'film', 'using', 'brighter', 'screen', 'resolution', 'film', 'was', 'much', 'easier', 'view', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'as', 'well', 'So', 'problem', 'solved', 'was', 'able', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'once', 'was', 'able', 'actually', 'view', 'it.The', 'story', 'was', 'great', 'thrills', 'were', 'decent', 'acting', 'environment', 'was', 'spectacular', 'are', 'fan', 'horror', 'films', 'believe', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'just', 'make', 'sure', 'change', 'TVs', 'viewing', 'settings', 'preset', 'contrast', 'brighter', 'resolution', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine']",N/A

Later on the full moon night, Melissa, Yul and the tour guide Ping (Dennis Chan) are stranded in a village where they learn, much too late, that the Chinese myth about the roaming spirits are all too real.The script is not bad. It is actually serviceable, if not special. The ""creatures"" (or whatever they are) are creepy. However, the film's shaky camera, probably intended for realism like ""Blair Witch,"" only creates motion sickness. Moreover, most of the events take place at night, so you sometimes don't know what is going on. Eduardo S&aacute;nchez, in fact, heavily relies on the techniques used in ""Blair Witch Project"" - fast editing, lighting, and even repeated use of f words, none of which really works.""Seventh Moon"" is not a terrible film.

When I saw this at the rental store, I decided to give it a try as it sounded promising. Well, to say i was disappointed is an understatement... the movie is badly shot and the story, though initially promising, quickly sinks into a mess of a movie, the only saving grace being the lead actress (Amy Smart).The story begins with a honeymooning couple. Amy Smart plays a newlywed who is on honeymoon somewhere in China with her Asian American husband who still has roots in China. They procure the services of a benign looking and friendly guide to take them into the Chinese countryside so that they can visit the husband's relatives. Hours later, the wife wakes up to find that their car is stranded in the middle of the countryside in a village, and it's dark. The guide tells her they are lost and that he will get help and return as soon as he can. An hour later, there is no sign of the guide, and so the newlyweds scramble out of the car and go in search of him. Before long, they discover that all is not as it should be and there are sinister goings-on - strange chiming sounds reverberate through the night, animals are tied up as some sort of offering, and they return to their car to find it has been splashed with some sort of bloody substance of indeterminate origin! This is no ordinary night either - it is the night of the full moon on the seventh month of the Lunar calendar where the spirits of the dead are released from the gates of Hell and visit the living, feasting on the offerings, and in this case, expecting something more substantial.Sounds like a great horror story right? Well, it could have been, except that the movie is shot mostly in the dark with insufficient background lighting which makes it hard to make out what exactly is going on. The creature effects are average, but the jerky camera movements really make this an annoying and frustrating viewing experience. The acting by the guy playing the husband was sub-par, and only Amy Smart delivers a credible performance as the anguished and horrified wife trying to figure out how to get themselves out of the mess.
