169533,A269SWH1PQL4PQ,1414341148,Dustybug,"[1, 1]","Several months ago, I had the opportunity to review a Christian children's movie from a biblical cartoon series begun by Chuck Swindoll, Paws and Tales.  I had mixed feelings about it as there were a few instances where bad behavior by the children in the story were either not addressed or were seemingly brushed aside.  Overall, I liked the movie, but recommended that parents watch with their children so that they would be readily available to discuss any problems as they occurred.I wanted to watch another part of the series to come to a more complete conclusion of my thoughts on the content.  In this DVD, Paws and Tales: Being Kind and Caring there are also two episodes based on Scripture references (Matthew 18:21-22 and Matthew 6:14).In episode 1, The Hullabaloo at Hunker Hill, Staci one of the main characters is dared to take a turn navigating a soapbox derby car built by a neighborhood bully.  Not one to be outdone, Staci takes the car for a spin and catastrophe ensues.  Staci's friends are put in a position where they must decide which is better: retaliation or forgiveness.In episode 2, The Great Go-kart Race there is a similar storyline, but this time The Club must figure out what will make a team perform at its best: teamwork and togetherness or individual agendas.Alright, so my thoughts?  Well, to be honest, I wasn't that impressed.  Many of the issues that I had with the last DVD seemed to be magnified in this installment of the series.  I found the children to be rude, mean spirited, and disrespectful to adults.  There were a few times where I thought the storyline was a bit too much for the preschool set(in episode one, there is a lot of discussion about whether or not Staci will die among other things).  While the negative behaviors were addressed a bit, I found the show to be lacking in good adult leadership.  Yes, it's a cartoon, but if my children exhibited behaviors such as the ones expressed in this movie, I'd have a lot more to say than, ""Oh, CJ.""  My children even pointed out how mean some of the characters were being too each other and I don't believe that the ""learning moments"" overpowered the bad behavior.I'm sad to write a mostly negative review of this movie because there really is a huge lack of good quality children's entertainment that holds a biblical worldview, but I have to be honest in my assessment.  Other parents may not take as much issue with the things that I mentioned and this could just be one flop in a series of great episodes, but with my misgivings from the last review and this one, I won't be purchasing or watching any more from Paws and Tales.",3,Disappointing,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",2012,2632,"['Several', 'months', 'had', 'opportunity', 'review', 'Christian', 'children', 'movie', 'biblical', 'cartoon', 'series', 'begun', 'Chuck', 'Swindoll', 'Paws', 'Tales', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'were', 'few', 'instances', 'where', 'bad', 'behavior', 'children', 'story', 'were', 'either', 'not', 'addressed', 'were', 'seemingly', 'brushed', 'aside', 'Overall', 'liked', 'movie', 'recommended', 'parents', 'watch', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'readily', 'available', 'discuss', 'problems', 'occurred.I', 'wanted', 'watch', 'part', 'series', 'come', 'more', 'complete', 'conclusion', 'thoughts', 'content', 'DVD', 'Paws', 'Tales', 'Being', 'Kind', 'Caring', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'episodes', 'based', 'Scripture', 'references', 'Matthew', '18:21-22', 'Matthew', '6:14', '.In', 'episode', '1', 'Hullabaloo', 'Hunker', 'Hill', 'Staci', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'dared', 'take', 'turn', 'navigating', 'soapbox', 'derby', 'car', 'built', 'neighborhood', 'bully', 'Not', 'one', 'be', 'outdone', 'Staci', 'car', 'spin', 'catastrophe', 'ensues', 'Staci', 'friends', 'are', 'put', 'position', 'where', 'must', 'decide', 'better', 'retaliation', 'forgiveness.In', 'episode', '2', 'Great', 'Go-kart', 'Race', 'similar', 'storyline', 'time', 'Club', 'must', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'will', 'make', 'team', 'perform', 'best', 'teamwork', 'togetherness', 'individual', 'agendas.Alright', 'thoughts', 'Well', 'be', 'honest', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'Many', 'issues', 'had', 'last', 'DVD', 'seemed', 'be', 'magnified', 'installment', 'series', 'found', 'children', 'be', 'rude', 'mean', 'spirited', 'disrespectful', 'adults', 'were', 'few', 'times', 'where', 'thought', 'storyline', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'preschool', 'set', 'episode', 'one', 'lot', 'discussion', 'not', 'Staci', 'will', 'die', 'other', 'things', 'negative', 'behaviors', 'were', 'addressed', 'bit', 'found', 'show', 'be', 'lacking', 'good', 'adult', 'leadership', 'Yes', 'cartoon', 'children', 'exhibited', 'behaviors', 'such', 'ones', 'expressed', 'movie', ""'d"", 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'say', 'Oh', 'CJ', 'children', 'even', 'pointed', 'out', 'how', 'mean', 'characters', 'were', 'being', 'too', 'other', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'learning', 'moments', 'overpowered', 'bad', 'behavior.I', ""'m"", 'sad', 'write', 'mostly', 'negative', 'review', 'movie', 'really', 'huge', 'lack', 'good', 'quality', 'children', 'entertainment', 'biblical', 'worldview', 'have', 'be', 'honest', 'assessment', 'Other', 'parents', 'may', 'not', 'take', 'much', 'issue', 'things', 'mentioned', 'could', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'flop', 'series', 'great', 'episodes', 'misgivings', 'last', 'review', 'one', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'purchasing', 'watching', 'more', 'Paws', 'Tales']",N/A

169535,A2MMDV260HV1PZ,1414341148,Jill H.,"[0, 0]","This DVD comes with two episodes to give children Biblical examples of how to be kind and caring:""The Hullaballoo at Hunker Hill"" episode is based on Matthew 18:21-22 and is about forgiveness. Staci has a derby car that she has won future races with. Hugh offers Staci a chance to drive his derby car, which he says is faster.  She ends up having an accident in his derby car when she takes his challenge. After the accident occurs there are people that need to be forgiven and it is shocking to find out who really wants forgiveness.""The Great Go-Kart Race"" episode is based on Matthew 6:14. It is about a group of people who each decide to make their own go-karts instead of working as a team. Each person finds their own materials and uses their own energy to build their go-karts; it ends up taking much longer than it would have taken to build one go-kart as a team though. As their work progresses they learn the hard way whether or not it was worth it to work individually.It was beneficial to me to hear Chuck Swindoll give introductions before the episodes. I loved the70x7 example from the Bible that is described in the ""The Hullaballoo at Hunker Hill"" episode, that we should keep forgiving, even if we are hurt multiple times. What was unique to me about the ""The Great Go-Kart Race"" episode was how one character was there to help all the people in the group, even though each of them was going their own way. The music videos at the end of both episodes touched my heart.A bonus with this dvd are children's activity files that can be downloaded on a computer.I received this DVD free from Tyndale Publishing for this review.

Being Kind and Caring: Biblical Wisdom for Kids (Paws & Tales) is a great example of the kind of shows I have her watch and that we both love. In fact it's her new favorite and just tonight she told me that it was ""the best of all"" and she hugged it, haha! While the animation isn't super high class that doesn't deter from the great stories, lessons, and the fact that Amber asks to watch it over and over again! Some of the other reviews have mentioned some name calling and fighting in the storyline, and while this hasn't seemed to deter Amber's attitude I have noticed that as one other reviewer mentioned the fact that often when negative behavior is shown, even in a bad light, that seems to be what Amber picks up on.Things like this can be an excellent teaching tool though!

169537,A2BKFUZAZAFFFR,1414341148,OurStoryHour,"[0, 0]","The first I heard of ""Paws & Tales"" was when this DVD was offered as a review copy from Tyndale.  As a family who has learned much from Chuck Swindoll's Biblical teaching, I was happy to pop this DVD in for our children.  I have since learned that there is also a Paws & Tales radio program.  We love listening to Adventures in Odyssey and many other radio/CD stories; this series would likely be another we would enjoy but unfortunately, we don't receive it on our local Christian radio station.There are two stories included in this particular DVD ~ forgiveness and helping others.  The 25-minute (approximately) stories are based on lessons we all need to remember from Matthew 18:21-22 and Matthew 6:14.  Our four children, aged 2-10 enjoyed watching these shows, although I think a child 10-12 would be at the upper end of the age spectrum for this type of presentation.Both story lines are similar, centering around Go-Kart/Soap Box races.  In the first story, the bear children need to work through issues of forgiveness versus revenge and in the second story they learn about working together to help each other out instead of forging through as a one-man team.There is a positive lesson taught and sound moral resolution found in each story.  It's nice to find Christian children's videos that aren't filled with innuendos and inappropriate material.  We try to limit tv to DVDs we have on hand, knowing instead that we can monitor what they are exposed to.  I would recommend Paws & Tales to others wanting to have solid videos in their collection for those rainy days or quiet time before bed.  I'll be looking for other titles in this series.",4,Biblical values,1346284800,"08 30, 2012",2012,1654,"['first', 'heard', 'Paws', 'Tales', 'was', 'when', 'DVD', 'was', 'offered', 'review', 'copy', 'Tyndale', 'family', 'who', 'learned', 'much', 'Chuck', 'Swindoll', 'Biblical', 'teaching', 'was', 'happy', 'pop', 'DVD', 'children', 'have', 'learned', 'also', 'Paws', 'Tales', 'radio', 'program', 'love', 'listening', 'Adventures', 'Odyssey', 'many', 'other', 'radio/CD', 'stories', 'series', 'would', 'likely', 'be', 'would', 'enjoy', 'unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'receive', 'local', 'Christian', 'radio', 'are', 'two', 'stories', 'included', 'particular', 'DVD', '~', 'forgiveness', 'helping', 'others', '25-minute', 'approximately', 'stories', 'are', 'based', 'lessons', 'need', 'remember', 'Matthew', '18:21-22', 'Matthew', '6:14', 'four', 'children', 'aged', '2-10', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'shows', 'think', 'child', '10-12', 'would', 'be', 'upper', 'end', 'age', 'spectrum', 'type', 'presentation.Both', 'story', 'lines', 'are', 'similar', 'centering', 'Go-Kart/Soap', 'Box', 'races', 'first', 'story', 'bear', 'children', 'need', 'work', 'issues', 'forgiveness', 'versus', 'revenge', 'second', 'story', 'learn', 'working', 'together', 'help', 'other', 'instead', 'forging', 'one-man', 'team.There', 'positive', 'lesson', 'taught', 'sound', 'moral', 'resolution', 'found', 'story', 'nice', 'find', 'Christian', 'children', 'videos', 'are', ""n't"", 'filled', 'innuendos', 'inappropriate', 'material', 'try', 'limit', 'tv', 'DVDs', 'have', 'hand', 'knowing', 'instead', 'can', 'monitor', 'what', 'are', 'exposed', 'would', 'recommend', 'Paws', 'Tales', 'others', 'wanting', 'have', 'solid', 'videos', 'collection', 'rainy', 'days', 'quiet', 'time', 'bed', ""'ll"", 'be', 'looking', 'other', 'titles', 'series']",N/A
