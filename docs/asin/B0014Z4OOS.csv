I am a thankful person when DVDs are released for the sole purpose that some shows stop releasing after a while or are not released at all.  So, that in mind, I will critique this on a purely fun point of view and not to seem unthankful in any way.I'm curious first off about the changes between Discs 1 and Discs 2/3.  It almost seems like disc one was an earlier release.  I mean, there's a Pokemon 4ever trailer on it?  It's just weird.However, I like the slim case idea.
