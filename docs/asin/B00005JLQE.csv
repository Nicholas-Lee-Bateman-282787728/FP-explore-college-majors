Eminem is one of my favorite rappers and when I heard that he had a movie coming out about his life, I just had to see it.  The film is about a young rapper trying to start out his career while having to live with his poor mother in a trailer park in a bad part of town.

The part that felt most real to me came early. I attended a black university in a ghetto of Tampa, but then I bicycled home to the Busch Gardens neighborhood. Kinda like wading in the shallow end of the pool at will while Eminem was in the deep end. That's one thing I got from the movie.""Sweet Home Alabama,"" as sent up by Eminem and Future, has to be one of the funniest and most clever things I've ever seen in a movie. I cracked up and annoyed the sleeping cat on my lap.Chinese viewers in China might not realize Detroit's supposed to look ugly in this film. Casting Kim Basinger was a stroke of genius, since the audience's view of the actress is about as low as Eminem's opinion of his mother.The later excitement felt very contrived, like maybe I was watching a movie. The inevitable battle at the end was a thing of beauty to rap fans everywhere, even this old redneck in China. Too bad it only lasted 5 minutes, but DVDs allow you to skip back as often as desired.Oh, and just to beat you over the head with the obvious, Eminem got out of the ghetto with his words.

Eminem) was a rap superstar with a lot of creativity for lyrics and rhymes, but when we heard that he was going to make an acting debut, everybody taught that he was a musician, not an actor and he was going to sunk the whole movie. But that wasn't the case.In &quot;8 Mile&quot;, not only he displays his hip-hop talents, but he also makes clear that he is a complete artist with great acting skills, even if he basically is playing himself, because it's hard to step in front of a camera and give a good performance, specially when most of the people wass waiting your for him to fail.&quot;8 Mile&quot; is a semi-biographical movie located in the lower-class Detroit, Jimmy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; and his friends are hip-hop aficionados that have a dream: someday they will be the next big thing in the hip-hop world. But Jimmy's friends know that his buddy &quot;B-Rabbit&quot; is the best rapper around; he just needs to display his talents in some way.The director Curtis Hanson was able to get good performances from everybody in the cast, the pace of the story is very good also, Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stellar, and the music is just great. The extras in the DVD are entertaining, specially the rap battles that doesn't appear in the movie, because we can see Eminem improvising rimes and songs.This is the kind of movie that is enjoyable, not only for Eminem or hip-hop fans, but it can be enjoyed by everyone.

603175,A2XZE1TB784HKX,B00005JLQE,"alex fryling ""youngfry""","[1, 1]",Here is another inspirational movie I look to when I am down or looking to be inspired. Eminem is the rare white rapper that had a hard upbringing. Make no mistake about it he is not vanilla ice or Fred durst he can actually rap and puts time and thought into his lyrics. This story is solid and starts at a hard time in his life where he does not know what to do. He loses his girlfriend his mother is addicted to drugs and alcohol and he is not living the life he dreamed. Every time he gets up in front of the crowd he gets nervous and can't rap but finally near the end he is able to take on the challenge. While Eminem didn't have a totally never come back upbringing it was hard enough and it is an inspiration to everyone. The music for this film is subpurve.

603176,A3C6X0DAM87GN4,B00005JLQE,Alex Udvary,"[3, 5]","Well here it is! The movie we all heard about. Rapper Eminem's venture into movies. When I first heard about this movie I was expecting to absolutely hate it. I thought it would turn out to be the worst movie of the year. And I thought all of this not because I'm not a fan of Eminem's, but, because I thought this was going to turn out to be a pretentious piece of junk that would have us sympathize with him and make us feel sorry for the life he's lead. And I wasn't ready to say I feel sorry for Eminem. Well, just to show everyone that I ALWAYS try to judge a movie fairly. I will admit, I liked this movie more than I thought I would. And I am forced to eat a little crow. Not the whole bird mind you, but, maybe a wing.""8 Mile"" as Jimmy Smith (Eminem) tells his friends is about a bunch of losers who do nothing but talk about getting of the ""8 mile"". All they do is talk about rapping. As if that's their ticket to a better life. As I heard Eminem say this I was shocked because, this was exactly what I was thinking. And that's the downfall of the movie. It's too slight. ""8 Mile"" doesn't go that extra mile (yes, pun intended!) to seperate itself from being an average movie to something better. Why do the characters in this movie think rapping is their way out of the ghetto? How about a better job? Sticking to school? All the characters do is talk about rapping. I swear that was all the dialogue. The characters rarely speak about anything else.Jimmy Smith (Eminem) is trying to get by. I guess he's just finished high school perhaps college. He just got fired from his job at white castle. Broke up with his girlfriend. And goes down to a local club run by his friend ""Future"" (Mekhi Phifer). Where he competes in ""battles"". A battle for those unfamilar with the term is basically a one on one fight with rhymes. Each person insults the other while rapping. And Jimmy thinks that if he can get a demo made he'll be on his way out of the 8 mile.Now maybe this all sounds enjoyable to you. But, the movie never does more than create a nice atmosphere. I was expecting more depth. I wanted the movie to dwell deeper into it's characters. I didn't just want to hear about what they think about rap. And there is one character who does try to change the subject now and then and everyone tells him to keep quiet. I think ""8 Mile"" wanted to achieve what I'm talking about. It didn't want to be a ""light"" movie or a ""popcorn flick"". It wanted to be something more important. And I say that because they went out to get Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys & L.A. Confidential) to direct it. If they weren't concerned with making an important movie they could of gotten any hack director to do the picture. The Eminem audience didn't go see this movie to see how Hanson's directing would be. They went to see Eminem! But because they set out to do more with the story they wanted a talented director. And who knows maybe Hanson did make many changes in the script. Perhaps he made major improvements. But, the story still comes off too slight. Nevertheless, they are things to be enjoyed while watching this movie. Namely the performance by Kim Basinger. She plays Jimmy's mother Stephanie. A woman who is dating a guy that went to school with her son. She lives in a trailer. And doesn't seem to have much to look forward to in the future. Also there's Brittany Murphy, who plays a girl Eminem likes. She does a nice job acting. But, I felt at the end of the movie, they forget about her and never resolve her part of the story. It would of been interesting if more information about her was given. And like I said, the movie does a good job at creating an urban atmosphere. It's because I have good things to say about the movie I wish the movie would of meet the expectations that could of been.Another question on people's mind is can Eminem act. The answer to that one is no. Now this is not to say he wasn't good in this movie. Most people are good at being themself. But, here is the real test. Can you see Eminem playing a complete 360 from the persona he's created for himself? I mean can you see him playing the kind of roles Freddie Prinze Jr. plays? No. And if he's not capable of playing different roles that means he can't act. And I doubt he wants to start a career in the movies anyway.So is ""8 Mile"" enjoyable? So-so. Fans of Eminem will probably enjoy the movie more then the rest of us. If for anything reason their expectations may not be as high as our's. Their fans of his, they'll go easy on him.

I was hoping the movie would explain more of how Eminem got his links into the rap world, but it really didn't go there.  It concentrated only on his very beginnings.  I must say I gave this movie a four simply for one scene.  The scene were Eminem ""battles"" (raps) in a club for the first time.  This scene was the best part of the film and the one that will probably hold the movie together.  The acting was also good.  I thought that most of the acting would be bad with the exception of Kim Basinger, but it turned out to be all right.  I have my doubts that this film will appeal to anyone who is not a fan of Eminem's music.  So if you aren't a fan, this movie probably won't change your mind.

The plot was interesting, the dialogue was true to life, and Eminem's acting skills were surprisingly strong.  Kim Basinger and the little girl who played ""Lilly"" were great.  Unfortunately, I thought Brittany Murphy's performance was irritating - to say the least.In general, I think she's a mediocre talent.  She was good in ""Clueless,"" but I haven't been impressed with anything since.  ""8 Mile"" hasn't changed that opinion.  Her character looked drugged, skanky, and all-around trashy.

603182,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JLQE,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","8)  Mekhi Phifer.  I know that this may not mean much to a lot of you, but Phifer is a ridiculously talented actor who just hasn't received the exposure he deserves.  It's hard for African American actors in this industry, because they are all too often either cast in predominantly Black films that get no exposure or they get cast as the stereotypical sidekick.  Phifer has bared his acting chops in every role he's been handed, and this is no exception.  He really sinks his teeth into the role of David `Future' Porter, giving him a life all his own, with real viewpoints, aspirations and emotions.  He is far more than just a `sidekick', he's a life force propelling his friend to greatness.7)  The rap.  Yeah, this is a rap movie so-to-speak, and the gritty rap battles are major highlights, especially the final ones where Rabbit grows a pair and lets it loose.  If you are a fan of Eminem as an artist, or any of his crew, then the freestyle rap-offs will have you smiling from ear-to-ear.6)  The gritty direction.  Curtis Hanson is a phenomenal director, and that statement is made based on his flawless transference of `L.A. Confidential' to the big screen back in 1997.  He brings an even grittier feel to this film, allowing the very essence of this man's life to burry itself in every frame.  This film feels SO LIVED IN, genuinely evoking from start to finish, and while other factors obviously are in play here, it is Hanson's direction that establishes the film's core.  He understands the tale he is telling, and he pulls so much out of this cast (I mean, he gets an Award worthy performance out of Eminem, but I'll get to that in a minute).5)  The sharp script.  This is a very smart film, because it could have easily fallen victim to the clich&eacute;s of the genre, but it doesn't; at all.  It really `goes there', creating real people with real issues and real situations that bleed so much honesty and truth.  Some have gripped about the relationship between Alex and Rabbit, but I find it truthful and earnest.  Even her betrayal reads with such gritty authenticity you can completely connect to it.  The dialog is realistic (yes, all those 4-letters words feel appropriate) and the progressive plot ends on a realistic note as well (that sense of accomplishment is never overshadowed by a Hollywoodized improbability).4)  R.I.P. Britney Murphy.  Yes, this is one of her finest roles.  I ache when I think that such a criminally underrated star (and such a breath of fresh beauty) is gone from us.  Her slick sensuality coupled with the understanding of her character (glorified groupie intent of getting a piece herself) helps create a character we love to hate, and cannot forget.3)  It's semi-autobiographical.  I think my friend said it best, when this film was released.  He said ""I'd love to see how Eminem got his start"" and while this is not a strict biography (it's loosly based on Marshall's life, pre-stardom) it really helps you appreciate who Eminem really is.  Taking bits from his shattered home-life (his relationship with his alcoholic mother takes a more tenderly frustrated turn in the film, as apposed to the volatile way he explains it now) as well as his talent, `8 Mile' gives the audience a glimpse into the trials and triumphs of one of hip-hops most notoriously controversial (and critically applauded) players.2)  Eminem is REALLY good here.  I'm serious.  I never would have thought that he would hold his own, and I actually thought that casting him in the lead was a bit of a mistake, but he really blew me away with this one.  I guess it is true, that once you lived it you understand it, because nothing about his performance seems forced or inappropriate.  He's so natural here, completely bringing you along as he travels the road to personal betterment.  I don't know if I can applaud the performance enough, and it's not just because he's a rapper and acting is out of his element so `for a rapper' he does a great job.  This is just a great performance, period.1)  Because I know what I'm talking about!

603187,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00005JLQE,audrey,"[2, 3]","I watched this film for two reasons: to try to understand the popularity of rap and to see if Eminem could act.  The film succeeded on both counts.  First, I learned to respect the musical genre more than I had before, coming to appreciate the essential character of the lyrics and picking up a basic vocabulary.  As for acting, I thought Marshall Mathers did a fine job.  While on paper the plot is a familiar one, about a young person wanting to move beyond their surroundings and better themselves using their own talents, the film still worked because Mathers aka Eminem aka Slim Shady has a charismatic screen presence.  Like Sean Penn or Frank Sinatra, he is a thinking presence and fun to watch on the screen.  The entire supporting cast is excellent, with Kim Basinger as B-Rabbit's troubled mother, Brittany Murphy as fellow traveller Alex and Mekhi Phifer as the friend we all wish we had. The B actors are solid and the club extras play a big role, bringing a real heartbeat to the rap battles at The Shelter.  Which brings up the music. It's an excellent soundtrack -- a mix of classic rap by Old Dirty Bastard and many others, battle songs by street rappers, and a sense of the title song as a work in progress.  I defy anyone who loves music to listen to the song 8 Mile and not enjoy it.  It's strong, it's hopeful, and besides, it rocks.The dvd extras are terrific, especially the 23-minute rap battle between Eminem and the four winners of a competition between 130+ extras; it was fun to listen to what the street rappers came up with slamming Eminem and what  Em improvised back.  He's very funny.  One also appreciates that he is hard working and a decent guy.  Also interesting in the extras is hearing from director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential) which makes me especially sorry there's no commentary track.  There is, however, a 10-minute featurette featuring Hanson and Mathers, song information and the ""Superman"" music video.All in all, if you're interested in Eminem, rap, coming-of-age stories, films about urban America, good acting or films in which music plays a large role, this is a film you could definitely enjoy.",5,enjoyable film debut for rapper eminem,1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,2149,"['watched', 'film', 'two', 'reasons', 'try', 'understand', 'popularity', 'rap', 'see', 'Eminem', 'could', 'act', 'film', 'succeeded', 'counts', 'First', 'learned', 'respect', 'musical', 'genre', 'more', 'had', 'coming', 'appreciate', 'essential', 'character', 'lyrics', 'picking', 'up', 'basic', 'vocabulary', 'acting', 'thought', 'Marshall', 'Mathers', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'paper', 'plot', 'familiar', 'one', 'young', 'person', 'wanting', 'move', 'surroundings', 'better', 'using', 'own', 'talents', 'film', 'still', 'worked', 'Mathers', 'aka', 'Eminem', 'aka', 'Slim', 'Shady', 'charismatic', 'screen', 'presence', 'Sean', 'Penn', 'Frank', 'Sinatra', 'thinking', 'presence', 'fun', 'watch', 'screen', 'entire', 'supporting', 'cast', 'excellent', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'B-Rabbit', 'troubled', 'mother', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'fellow', 'traveller', 'Alex', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'friend', 'wish', 'had', 'B', 'actors', 'are', 'solid', 'club', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'bringing', 'real', 'heartbeat', 'rap', 'Shelter', 'up', 'music', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'mix', 'classic', 'rap', 'Old', 'Dirty', 'Bastard', 'many', 'others', 'battle', 'songs', 'street', 'rappers', 'sense', 'title', 'song', 'work', 'progress', 'defy', 'anyone', 'who', 'music', 'listen', 'song', '8', 'Mile', 'not', 'enjoy', 'strong', 'hopeful', 'besides', 'dvd', 'extras', 'are', 'terrific', 'especially', '23-minute', 'rap', 'battle', 'Eminem', 'four', 'winners', 'competition', '130+', 'extras', 'was', 'fun', 'listen', 'what', 'street', 'rappers', 'came', 'up', 'slamming', 'Eminem', 'what', 'Em', 'improvised', 'back', 'very', 'funny', 'One', 'also', 'hard', 'working', 'decent', 'guy', 'Also', 'interesting', 'extras', 'hearing', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'especially', 'sorry', 'commentary', 'track', 'however', '10-minute', 'featurette', 'featuring', 'Hanson', 'Mathers', 'song', 'information', 'Superman', 'music', 'video.All', ""'re"", 'interested', 'Eminem', 'rap', 'coming-of-age', 'stories', 'films', 'urban', 'America', 'good', 'acting', 'films', 'music', 'large', 'role', 'film', 'could', 'definitely', 'enjoy']",8 Mile

I think my impression at first of the overall acting to be weak, but now, I feel everybody did equally good. Probably the best parts of the film will have to be the rap battles.

In the same vein, rapping is a real waste of time, but it shockingly makes a lot of money for some. Finally, Eminem...he wasn't that bad at all; just liked to have seen him in more movies to see if he could create more range.

Despite never being a fan, and despising rap in general, I have to say that this movie is better than expected. The intangibles are quite strong. The guys in his crew and the shots of Detroit are very interesting. The idea of rap jousting is also pretty novel. As far as acting goes, Kim Bassinger is a stand-out in her portrayal of Rabbit's alcoholic, promiscuous, and broken mother. In terms of the plot itself, most of it will be familiar to those who know anything about the performers' life. I'm not sure how much of the film is autobiographical but it seems like a textbook example of ""writing about what you know.""In fact, it is Eminem's treatment of himself which really brings 8 mile down, and made it just another flick. Rabbit, as a man, just isn't realistic. He's a self-righteous martyr, and, while that might be the way Eminem views himself, such an angle makes for a really boring plot. Audiences just doesn't care much about guys who are wooden. There's nothing ambiguous about Rabbit; he's a great brother, loyal boyfriend, devoted artist, blah, blah, blah. Generally, people just aren't like that. He has a great group of friends in the movie, but frankly, I'm surprised they stay with him because he's so uptight, irritable, and melodramatic. He treats his friend David ""Future"" Porter terribly, although, for some reason, the guy forgives him. If he were able to detach himself more from Rabbit, I'm sure Mr. Mathers could have put together a more compelling script.",3,A Decent Effort.,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",2006,1606,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'trying', 'expand', 'horizons', 'lately', 'what', 'caused', 'check', 'out', 'Eminem', 'big', 'silver', 'screen', 'venture', 'never', 'being', 'fan', 'despising', 'rap', 'general', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'better', 'expected', 'intangibles', 'are', 'quite', 'strong', 'guys', 'crew', 'shots', 'Detroit', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'idea', 'rap', 'jousting', 'also', 'pretty', 'novel', 'As', 'far', 'acting', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'stand-out', 'portrayal', 'Rabbit', 'alcoholic', 'promiscuous', 'broken', 'mother', 'terms', 'plot', 'most', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'who', 'know', 'anything', 'performers', 'life', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'autobiographical', 'textbook', 'example', 'writing', 'what', 'know', 'fact', 'Eminem', 'treatment', 'really', '8', 'mile', 'down', 'made', 'just', 'flick', 'Rabbit', 'man', 'just', ""n't"", 'realistic', 'self-righteous', 'martyr', 'might', 'be', 'way', 'Eminem', 'angle', 'really', 'boring', 'plot', 'Audiences', 'just', ""n't"", 'care', 'much', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'wooden', 'nothing', 'ambiguous', 'Rabbit', 'great', 'brother', 'loyal', 'boyfriend', 'devoted', 'artist', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Generally', 'people', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'group', 'friends', 'movie', 'frankly', ""'m"", 'surprised', 'stay', 'so', 'uptight', 'irritable', 'melodramatic', 'friend', 'David', 'Future', 'Porter', 'terribly', 'reason', 'guy', 'were', 'able', 'detach', 'more', 'Rabbit', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Mr.', 'Mathers', 'could', 'have', 'put', 'together', 'more', 'compelling', 'script']",8 Mile

This doesn't necessarily make it a bad film, just not  the great film you've been hearing about.  In my personal opinion, critics and fans were so suprised that Eminem's foray into acting wasn't as bad as expected that they were stumbling all over themselves to praise what was essentially a cliched story of a down-and-out artist struggling to make it.All of the over-used plot points are present: poverty, raw talent, troubled youth, resistance from parents and peers, a troubled relationship with a beautiful girl.  But in the hands of director Curtis Hanson and Eminem's suprisingly good acting (although he was essentially playing himself, so I'm not sure that its much of a stretch for him), the cliches don't seem to wear on the audience as much and you seem to connect with the his character and the troubles he faces.The real triumph of 8 Mile has to be the Oscar-winning song ""Lose Yourself,"" Curtis Hanson's unique gift of perfectly recreating inner-city Detroit and the rap ""battles.""  I am not a fan of Eminem's music at all, but the relentless and driving beats and lyrics of Lose Yourself make it quite possibly one of the best songs released in the past decade and a deserved  Oscar winner.  Moreover, the way that Hanson brings the viewer into Detroit circa-1994 and the aspects of life at that time (especially the ""battles"") is brilliant and is one of the numerous aspects of the film that helped me overlook the tortured cliches.  It really helps the viewer connect with the characters in my opinion.Bottom line:  if you have a free night, and some extra cash rent it.  If you aren't a fan of Eminem, at least consider it.

603197,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00005JLQE,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[4, 5]","Undoubtedly, the surprise film of 2002 was 8 Mile, the story about a young white rapper in Detroit who struggles with his broken family, gold-digging friends, and simply to find his identity in the nefarious world in which he lives. Starring the best-selling rap artist Eminem, 8 Mile is supposedly autobiographical in nature, portraying the true life rise of Marshall Mathers from the hardened streets of Detroit to the gold paved highways of superstardom. But the film begins and ends in the ghetto, cataloguing the time prior to the rapper's success. As a movie, it performs its duties well - virtually transporting the viewer to the crime and poverty riddled neighborhoods of one of America's most dangerous cities...Local youth Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith, Jr. harbors dreams of hitting the big-time as a rapper (along with most of his peers in Detroit), but few are supportive of his efforts, especially his mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger), a self-centered woman who neglects her five-year-old daughter, remains unemployed, and generally wastes her life away. Her verbal battles with Jimmy are the only substantive part of their relationship.When Jimmy gets a job working on an assembly line at a sheet metal factory, he works long hours in the dead end job making just enough money to get by. Living in a trailer with his mother so that he can save up enough money for a demo tape leads to everyday confrontations with the woman. Things begin to look up, though, when Jimmy meets Alex (Brittany Murphy), an aspiring model who shares his dreams of leaving the ghetto and pursuing a better life. But everything goes awry when Jimmy chokes at a local late-night rap showdown.The bad news continues when Jimmy catches Alex cheating on him, his mother kicks him out, and a gang of thugs gives him a beating - placing a gun to his head and threatening to pull the trigger.When the opportunity arises to perform once more in the local rap showdown, all of Jimmy's dreams hinge on his ability to pull out all the stops. Can he verbally destroy his opponent and gain the notoriety necessary to put him on the map...?A surprisingly well-written screenplay wrought with symbolism, 8 Mile vividly portrays the life of an angry urban youth who aches to express his hatred for the world around him. As the dividing line between the city Detroit and the outside world, 8 Mile represents was is and what can be. The film's ability to draw the audience into a world of which they may not be a part makes this a definite must-see film. For those conservative or older viewers who may be reluctant to the see the film because of its leading star Eminem, I highly recommend giving 8 Mile a chance.

Eminem plays Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith who has a hidden talent in rap & his friends contuniously incourage him to pursue a rap career. It's hard for Jimmy at first cause he is white & it's hard for him to find someone to be nice to him in that business. It is a cruel world at times & 8 Mile captures that quite well! Brittany Murphy is quite sexy in this role & the best part, unlike Jessica Simpson, she can actually act & she makes her performance more believeable than it could be! Now, 8 Mile might not be everyone's cup of tea cause it is a drama, there is lots yelling & it is a very dark movie. But for me, that's what it makes interesting!

Kim Basinger, who played his mum, did a great job. We have heard the rumours of Eminem's mum, and if they are true, then the movie did her justice.  Having the movie based on Eminem's life, I think movie-goers can see where he comes from when writing his lyrics.This is a great coming of age movie, that really in the end, has a point to get across.

Eminem is nothing less than wonderful in his first starring role and brings surprising energy and intelligence to his role as would-be rapper Rabbit.

This film doesn't feel artificial in any way; all the sets seem realer than real and the aura of poverty is almost tangible.

Anyway, I show up to let people know what to expect when they see a movie so that they don't witness something that they don't want to see, and instead see something they do.  Or, I give warning so that they can enjoy something they know they won't be offended by.In this movie, you can find me shaped like a big letter ""R.""  Why?  Well to start, there's a lot of bad words.  Also, there's some graphic displays of sex which only adults should see.  Don't forget the violence too!  Now keep in mind, ""R"" means that if you're under 17, you shouldn't see this movie since you're not mature enough for it.  For the rest of you, ask yourself, ""If a 16-year-old might be shocked by this movie, will I be?""  If it's yes, don't see this movie.Now then, if the stuff I've listed doesn't offend you too much, or you don't mind it in context with the movie, you'll like this movie!

603209,A5DIAZ5GT3MC,B00005JLQE,Crazy Jim,"[2, 4]","The acting debut of Eminem in ""8-Mile"" makes for an excellent breakthrough for the popular rap star. Em (real name: Marshall Mathers) is Jimmy Smith (a.k.a. ""Rabbit""), a working-class white kid from the racially-divided lines of inner Detriot.Smith lives in a trailer park with his alcoholic mom and her much younger boyfriend but spends his days, working in a garage, and looks to make ends meet as a rapper. He has two ways of doing this: One, through battle-rapping at a club spot hosted by his best friend, Future, and the other is relying on help from a so-called talent agent.While this movie is highly entertaining upon first view, it definetly suffers from some horrible writing and real lackluster characters (other than its lead). For some reason, all of Rabbit's buddies have nothing better to do than wait around for him to decide what he wants. It seems rather unlikely that in a movie set in 1995 when white rappers were viewed as jokes, that a handful of Smith's black followers would stand around with nothing better to do than wait on their ""white savior"". His black militant friend takes the cake as far as ""filler"" characters go. He seems to just take up space as he waits to throw out a cheesy sterotypical line about being held down. He goes nowhere with these opinions and just seems to stand around, playing the background.Eminem, himself, is great as Smith but he seems too much like a good character in a movie filled with bad cartoon characters. He's a deep character stuck in SAVE THE LAST DANCE. That's right. This script makes some of the same mistakes as ""Last Dance"" in its belief that urban kids stand around and talk about ""hip-hop lingo"" like they are explaining it to a documentarian. To be fair, it's not quite as bad as ""Last Dance"" but it does get really annoying. The story involving Smith and his mother makes for some good moments but it still doesn't quite make up for such awful characters.This is actually a real good movie at times but again, the script could certainly have stood to go through a few more re-writes.

Eminem pulls out all the stops here with a strong performance as a somewhat alter version of himself, a white boy growing up in Detroit with dreams to be a rapper.  What makes this film better than the weight of the plot is, first the A list cast including Kim Bassinger and Mikhi Phifer but it's the brilliant script and excelent direction that picks this movie up and carries it further then plot alone would.  Yes, this may or may not be how Eminem got his breaks in life but regardless, this film, watched as a fictional story and not an autobiography will do well to make the difference.  Eminem shows true talent as his charactor (Rabbit) tries to rise above the life he was given, the drunk mother and the slum living conditions, the ex-girlfriend who took him for everything and the dead beat friends he's determined not to become.  Rabbit wants more for himself and for his family, and he's determined to work hard to get it.  Throw in a new love interest (Britany Murphy in a peformance to make you go GA'GA) and some rival thugs and you have a simple plot turned great movie with subplots that hold your interest and keep you in anticipation of the next scene.

603214,A13RM1AWD1C5ZR,B00005JLQE,Daniel K.,"[0, 1]","8 Mile, a new film from Curtis Hanson and starring Eminem was actually quite good.  I saw this film nearly a year ago, in theatres during its opening weekend and I must say, I wasn't displeased.  Though Emimen never will be someone I admire, I must say that he does have talent and that he can, ok hear me out on this, ACT!The premise of 8 Mile is nothing incomprehensible, essentially Eminem plays Jimmy Rabbit, a guy from Detroit who has nothing going for him, but wants to be a rapper.  He has some good pals, including David Porter aka ""Future"" played nicely by Mekhi Pfiefer.  Rabbit lives in a trailor with his dissoluted mother played by Kim Basinger, they're relationship seems to be volatile and unsteady.  Gorgeous Brittany Murphy plays Alex, Emimen's love interest.  The film is nicely directed by Curtis Hanson also featuring a good screenplay from Scott Silver.  Hanson who made other great films including ""Wonder Boys"" and the excellent ""L.A. Confidential,"" makes another wonderful film here.The true, exciting parts of this film are without question the rap battles, which are masterfully done.  Though I was sort of anticipating a nomination for the song ""Lose Yourself"", I didn't expect it to actually win.  I also thought that film might receive other nods, but oh well.  All in all, 8 Mile features a good cast.Some things which I'm still uncertain about is how accurate is this movie in accordance to the real life of Emimen?I'm sure some of it is, but how much?  The sex scene between Murphy and Emimen's characters seemed gratuitous, it didn't seem like there was any chemistry between them and the scene didn't seem to have any special meaning or purpose.  It was also a tad long, or so it seemed, but not specifically hardcore or graphic, as demonstarted in one scene inMonster' Ball.8 Mile is rated R for Strong Language, Sexuality, Some Violence and Drug Use.  The language well, sure that's obvious to expect and is the main reason for the ""R"" rating.  It's fairly strong, and is also included in rap lyrics besides dialogue.  The sexual content includes three fairly explicit sexual situations including the Murphy/Eminem sex scene.  No nudity, which they could've thrown in there cause it wouldn't have hurt or lessened the rating, and surprisingly there isn't any in the ""Uncensored"" edition on the DVD.  The violence isn't all particularly graphic or brutal, mainly some fistfights and a non-lethal shooting.  There is also some marijuana smoking.  All in all, a fine movie, worth owning on Video or DVD.",4,8 Mile-Eminem Wins by A Mile,1067644800,"11 1, 2003",2003,2536,"['8', 'Mile', 'new', 'film', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'starring', 'Eminem', 'was', 'actually', 'quite', 'good', 'saw', 'film', 'nearly', 'year', 'ago', 'theatres', 'opening', 'weekend', 'must', 'say', 'was', ""n't"", 'displeased', 'Emimen', 'never', 'will', 'be', 'someone', 'admire', 'must', 'say', 'have', 'talent', 'can', 'ok', 'hear', 'out', 'ACT', 'premise', '8', 'Mile', 'nothing', 'incomprehensible', 'essentially', 'Eminem', 'Jimmy', 'Rabbit', 'guy', 'Detroit', 'who', 'nothing', 'going', 'be', 'rapper', 'good', 'pals', 'including', 'David', 'Porter', 'Future', 'played', 'nicely', 'Mekhi', 'Pfiefer', 'Rabbit', 'trailor', 'dissoluted', 'mother', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', ""'re"", 'relationship', 'be', 'volatile', 'unsteady', 'Gorgeous', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Alex', 'Emimen', 'love', 'interest', 'film', 'nicely', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'also', 'featuring', 'good', 'screenplay', 'Scott', 'Silver', 'Hanson', 'who', 'made', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'including', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'excellent', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'wonderful', 'film', 'here.The', 'true', 'exciting', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'question', 'rap', 'battles', 'are', 'masterfully', 'done', 'was', 'sort', 'anticipating', 'nomination', 'song', 'Lose', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'actually', 'win', 'also', 'thought', 'film', 'might', 'receive', 'other', 'nods', 'oh', 'well', '8', 'Mile', 'features', 'good', 'cast.Some', 'things', ""'m"", 'still', 'uncertain', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'accordance', 'real', 'life', 'Emimen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'how', 'much', 'sex', 'scene', 'Murphy', 'Emimen', 'characters', 'seemed', 'gratuitous', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'was', 'chemistry', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'special', 'meaning', 'purpose', 'was', 'also', 'tad', 'long', 'so', 'seemed', 'not', 'specifically', 'hardcore', 'graphic', 'demonstarted', 'one', 'scene', 'inMonster', 'Ball.8', 'Mile', 'rated', 'R', 'Strong', 'Language', 'Sexuality', 'Violence', 'Drug', 'Use', 'language', 'well', 'sure', 'obvious', 'expect', 'main', 'reason', 'R', 'rating', 'fairly', 'strong', 'also', 'included', 'rap', 'lyrics', 'dialogue', 'sexual', 'content', 'three', 'fairly', 'explicit', 'sexual', 'situations', 'including', 'Murphy/Eminem', 'sex', 'scene', 'nudity', 'could', ""'ve"", 'thrown', 'there', 'cause', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'hurt', 'lessened', 'rating', 'surprisingly', ""n't"", 'Uncensored', 'edition', 'DVD', 'violence', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'graphic', 'brutal', 'mainly', 'fistfights', 'non-lethal', 'shooting', 'also', 'marijuana', 'smoking', 'fine', 'movie', 'worth', 'owning', 'Video', 'DVD']",8 Mile

And one more thing - his acting's not too bad, either.That will surely come as a disappointment to those who were hoping for him to fall flat in his feature-film debut, ""8 Mile."" But he acquits himself nicely, lending credibility to a drama that examines not only hip-hop music but impoverished urban America as well.Which is not to say that ""8 Mile"" is problem-free. Despite its edgy, raw-nerved approach, the film is somewhat clichs mother (Kim Basinger) in her trailer home.But he has hopes for bigger things, including a career as an MC. However, when the time comes for him to actually perform his act onstage, he chokes and is unable to utter as much as a word.Then a series of good things happen, including the arrival of Alex (Brittany Murphy), a would-be model who sees big things in Jimmy and encourages him. Still, that's easier said than done, especially when he faces competition from a rival hip-hop crew, and even his friends and family don't really seem to believe in him.It should be noted that neither Mathers nor filmmaker Curtis Hanson have said that the film is a definitive biography of the controversial hip-hop star. Rather, it takes some of his real-life events and dramatizes them.The results are highly watchable. In fact, there might not be a more rousing moment on film this year as the scene in which Rabbit finally turns the tables on his tormenters on the stage.That's at least due in part to Mathers, who's quite believable. Of course, he's also got a talented supporting cast to bolster him in weaker moments. Murphy continues her string of solid performances, while both Mekhi Pfifer and Basinger are better here than either has been in quite some time.""8 Mile"" is rated R for frequent use of strong sex-related profanity, racial epithets and explicit sexual talk, violence (beatings and some gunplay), scenes of simulated sex and simulated drug use (marijuana), brief nudity (flashes of male and female backsides) and brief gore.

The story is mainly about about this guy called rabbit(eminem) who has been brought up in the poor... suburbs of detroit, and his mum(kim basinger) is very strugling with money and depending on bingo games, and rabbit is taking up a job as a car manufacturer, and he is willing to be a successful rapper, though at first he was a not so good rapper, and he is also being bullied by some blacks seeming he is like one of the only white rappers in town, and as we get closer to the middle of the film rabbit falls in love with this girl(brittany murphy), and a bit after the middle she becomes very impressed with eminems rapping and they then fall in love with each other.One of the main things i didn't expect in this movie is the humor, i just didn't know that there would be some humor, any way yes this movie actually is quite a funny and sweet movie. The funny parts in the movie are mainly the rap battles where other rappers go against each other and humiliate each other. Now onto the sweet part of the movie, yes this movie is actually sweet. Apart from the racism and bullying, this movie is very sweet. I thought the relationships of eminem and his friends in the movie was very sweet, because they always stuck up for each other, laughed with each other and apart from those arguments they have had, they where overall best friends and where always there for each other.Ok now im sure there are some parents who would like to know if this is suitable for their children so heres a fairly brief classification on the movies language, violence, drug use and sexual content.LANGUAGE: This movie contains alot of coarse language, though most of the time it is used for silly reasons or as a joke. The film has alot of racism especially held at whites, so yeah be warned that this movie is high on coarse language.VIOLENCE: This movie does not contain any deaths, though it has alot of gang fights(fights with no weapons), and this movie is very very low on gore. The goriest bit in the movie is when rabbits friend accidently shots himself in the leg, though survives. So this movie is low on violence.DRUG USE: This movie contains a bit of drug use, though alot of drinking and drunk characters and a bit of smoking, so overall this movie is average on drug use.SEXUAL CONTENT: This movie has about three sex scenes in it. The first one isn't to bad, the third one isn't to bad, though the seconde one is very big. The movie contains a bit of nudity, but not to much kissing. Though the all three sex scenes aren't explicit. Overall this movie is average on sexual content.Overall i thought this was a great movie was great and i think it would be suitable 13 years and older, though if 13 it would be best to be accompanied with a parent like i was, so THANKYOU FOR READING-peace",4,A great film!!!,1053129600,"05 17, 2003",2003,2856,"['never', 'really', 'thought', 'i', ""'d"", 'like', 'film', 'suprise', 'i', 'did', 'story', 'mainly', 'about', 'guy', 'called', 'rabbit', 'eminem', 'who', 'been', 'brought', 'up', 'poor', 'suburbs', 'detroit', 'mum', 'kim', 'basinger', 'very', 'strugling', 'money', 'depending', 'bingo', 'games', 'rabbit', 'taking', 'up', 'job', 'car', 'manufacturer', 'willing', 'be', 'successful', 'rapper', 'though', 'first', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'rapper', 'also', 'being', 'bullied', 'blacks', 'seeming', 'one', 'only', 'white', 'rappers', 'town', 'get', 'closer', 'middle', 'film', 'rabbit', 'love', 'girl', 'brittany', 'murphy', 'bit', 'middle', 'very', 'impressed', 'eminems', 'rapping', 'then', 'fall', 'love', 'other.One', 'main', 'things', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'movie', 'humor', 'i', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'would', 'be', 'humor', 'way', 'movie', 'actually', 'funny', 'sweet', 'movie', 'funny', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'mainly', 'rap', 'battles', 'where', 'other', 'rappers', 'go', 'other', 'humiliate', 'other', 'Now', 'sweet', 'part', 'movie', 'yes', 'movie', 'actually', 'sweet', 'Apart', 'racism', 'bullying', 'movie', 'very', 'sweet', 'thought', 'relationships', 'eminem', 'friends', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'sweet', 'always', 'stuck', 'up', 'other', 'laughed', 'other', 'apart', 'arguments', 'have', 'had', 'where', 'overall', 'best', 'friends', 'where', 'always', 'other.Ok', 'now', 'sure', 'are', 'parents', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'suitable', 'children', 'so', 'fairly', 'brief', 'classification', 'movies', 'language', 'violence', 'drug', 'use', 'sexual', 'content.LANGUAGE', 'movie', 'alot', 'coarse', 'language', 'most', 'time', 'used', 'silly', 'reasons', 'joke', 'film', 'alot', 'racism', 'especially', 'held', 'whites', 'yeah', 'be', 'warned', 'movie', 'high', 'coarse', 'language.VIOLENCE', 'movie', 'not', 'contain', 'deaths', 'alot', 'gang', 'fights', 'fights', 'weapons', 'movie', 'very', 'very', 'low', 'gore', 'goriest', 'bit', 'movie', 'when', 'rabbits', 'friend', 'accidently', 'shots', 'leg', 'survives', 'So', 'movie', 'low', 'violence.DRUG', 'USE', 'movie', 'bit', 'drug', 'use', 'alot', 'drinking', 'drunk', 'characters', 'bit', 'smoking', 'so', 'overall', 'movie', 'average', 'drug', 'use.SEXUAL', 'CONTENT', 'movie', 'three', 'sex', 'scenes', 'first', 'one', ""n't"", 'bad', 'third', 'one', ""n't"", 'bad', 'seconde', 'one', 'very', 'big', 'movie', 'bit', 'nudity', 'not', 'much', 'kissing', 'three', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', ""n't"", 'explicit', 'Overall', 'movie', 'average', 'sexual', 'content.Overall', 'i', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'was', 'great', 'i', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'suitable', '13', 'years', 'older', '13', 'would', 'be', 'best', 'be', 'accompanied', 'parent', 'i', 'was', 'THANKYOU', 'FOR', 'READING-peace']",8 Mile
603222,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,B00005JLQE,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[2, 3]","A disapppointing film about the underground culture of rap battles, modern versions of doin' the dozens that many aspiring MCs dream will make them stars.  Speaking charitably, I don't think it was the fault of ultra-charismatic rapper Eminem that he was cast in the role of Ron Howard in this inner-city update of ""American Graffiti,"" but it's still a shame that the weak script and sluggish direction didn't provide better opportunities for him to explore his acting range. While the messed-up, derelict trashiness of the blight-striken 'hoods of Detroit is shown with crisp, gritty detail, the social nuances of the hip-hop scene are reduced to a near-cartoonish simplicity, in which Eminem (as ""B. Rabbit,"" his character's street name) and his too-goofy crew run up against the obnoxious swaggering of the Free World, a musical group that has already made it, and lords it over the rest of the scene.  Too much time is spent building up numerous plot points that show how desperate and depressing Rabbit's life is -- the movie simply bogs down, and if we could have seen about half as much of this stuff, and about three times as much actual rapping, things would have been much, much better.  While ""8 Mile"" probably succeeds in making underground hip-hop culture accessible to mainstream America, it probably would have been a better movie had it been played a little tougher.  Several aspects of this film rang false, particularly the overly-likeable Fat Albert gang that Rabbit hangs out with, and the gratuitously [promiscous] scenes with his new girlfriend, played by Brittany Murphy, as well as the unfortunate absence of a wall-to-wall, booming soundtrack.  The film does access a hidden culture, but it does so at the expense of subtlety and directorial finesse.  It's surprising that Chris Hanson, who made a taut thriller like ""LA Confidential,"" could let such a juicy story like this lapse into tedium.  Plus, what a drag that Mekhi Phifer (the aptly-named Dr. Pratt, of TV's ""E.R."") was cast as Em's best bud... Phifer is one of the most leaden and overly-obvious actors around; couldn't they have found *anyone* who would be more fun to watch for two hours?  Anyway, I guess that while this wasn't the dramatic breakthrough for Eminem that many reviewers said it was, that it's still an okay film.  If nothing else, in his climactic rap-battle scene, he got the opportunity to present his blueprint for how white kids who are into rap can diffuse the race-baiting of their critics: look 'em in the eye and say, ""Yeah, so?  What's your point?"" It would have been nice if the other 110 minutes of this film offered as much of a message, but I guess you can't ask for everything.",3,+1/2.

603224,A2H0Q6AGS7X55I,B00005JLQE,"D. R Hayes ""D.R. Hayes""","[0, 4]","I went to see this on my birthday the day after it was released in the movies. I did this for my late wife, and nothing else. I really really didn't like this movie at all for the most part. I admit I don't understand the rap culture, and why it's considered music where your main objective is to make the other people feel stupid. However, I can't help if my late wife may have felt in a sense that Eminem was the messiah. I mean that's the way he was portrayed in here. I know that Eminem was the only one who could reach my wife in 2002 as she went through a major depression, and felt that Jesus Christ couldn't help her, and I didn't know how to help her. Anyway why I feel that Emeinem was portrayed as Christ in this movie? I feel in a sense he was defintely misunderstood by everyone for starters his Mom played by Kim Basinger(who is one woman I would love to cream on), His mother's boyfriend who taunts, and ridicules him, and his friends who don't know about him at times with his moods, and so forth, the 2 women in his life an ex-girlfriend, and the one played by Brittany Murphy, and finally a world of upcoming rappers who aren't too happy to see a white boy rap. That's right in 2002 the world of rap was still very black, and they surrounded the curtain leading to the holy of holies where no white man ever trod. Eminem's character would break the color barrier here, and the curtain is ripped apart. Mind you at the beginning Eminem falls flat on his face when he chokes on a rap, but not everyone took kindly to Jesus's words when he first came to preach either. I feel that the last part of the movie was loosely based on the last week of Jesus with the crucifixion, and ressurection. It all begins when one of the black rappers helps himself to some Brittany, and Eminem clocks him kind of like Jesus overturning the moneychanger's tables in the synagogue, then the crucifixion where the black rapper returns the favor to Eninem, and Eninem doesn't retailiate the same way Jesus allowed the Romans and Pharissees to crucify him on the old rugged cross. Then the ressurection when Eninem wins the rap contest against that same black rapper. This is only my opinion as comparing Eninem with Jesus. No One can ever match up against Jesus. So why do I write it then? I feel that this is the way that the music industry, and Hollywood has portrayed him, and it's rather sad as all Eninem can do is write raps mostly about himself, and all the troubles he's seen. I don't know what he's going to be up to next, but I know the last song I heard from him where he samples the Aerosmith song ""Dream On"" was one of the most uninspiring songs I've ever heard. I wasn't impressed with this for the most part except for the scenes with the little girl. I found them to be very endearing, and what saved the movie from absolute ruin.

603225,A3EQQP0LD4Z375,B00005JLQE,Dr. Lee D. Carlson,"[1, 2]","Rap music, popular for a couple of decades now, has taken a lot of heat lately, primarily due to it being interpreted as &quot;gangsta&quot; rap, and held responsible for breakdown in social order. The group labeled as &quot;right-wing conservatives&quot;, however inaccurate this term may be, has been quoted as being against the &quot;phenomenon of rap music&quot;, for the reason that such music instills debauchery, violence, lack of ambition, and disrespect for family values.I viewed this film while on vacation, and the splurges in free time that accompany such endeavors instigate that new things be tried: that one entertain oneself with the unusual. The persons with me on the vacation were curious as to the content of the movie, and so with popcorn, beer, and an open mind, we sat down on a not-so-comfortable couch and concentrated our attention to what some have called &quot;proof&quot; of the decline of U.S. culture.What we viewed was interesting, and not what we expected. But art has the habit of bringing you out of equilibrium, and this piece of art, this movie, was a pretty strong perturbation. What was observed was a character with a strong work ethic: working by day, rapping by night. A character with deep concern with his baby sister's care and well-being.  A character whose ambition to break from his routine and find something better bordered on obsession. A character who insisted on being genuine, on being honest with himself, and not masking your origins or upbringing.[Are these not &quot;family values&quot;? Will Western civilization decay because of the practice of values like these?]Was he a &quot;perfect&quot; character? Well, no: he broke with his girlfriend when learning (or making the assumption) she was pregnant. He was violent at times, and followed the crowd without question at one point (the burning of the vacant house). He let himself be intimidated (at first) by an audience.This character clearly believed in the value of a focused life: his  extreme note-taking for his eventual musical rap confrontations. A random walk through life was not going to get him where he wanted to be. Playing bingo, like his mother, and not planning...not working, was not the way.The harsh language in the rap confrontations is balanced by its inventiveness, its creativity. It is actually very fun. One can get intoxicated with its free play.

Although it's self-serving at times, this is also an impressively open and honest take on Eminem's roots and the self-imposed blockade of excuses he laid out for himself before catching so much as a whiff of stardom. The plot outside of Mr. Marshall Mathers is fairly simplistic and limited, though, with most of the cast simply orbiting the star and reacting to his angry, frustrated outbursts. I found the battle raps to be as intense and exciting as a good action scene, and the choice to limit them to a few key moments was a smart move that doubled their importance.

603227,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,B00005JLQE,Duane Thomas,"[2, 2]","Okay, to start with you want to know, ""Is a hip-hop movie starring white rapper Eminem worth my time?"" Answer: oh yes. Second you ask, ""How good was Eminem as an actor?"" Answer: you'll be amazed.8 Mile Road in Detroit is the boundary between city and suburbs, and, at the time this movie's set (1995) was very much the color line, black inside 8 Mile, white outside. If you were an aspiring hip-hop singer at that time, in that place, it was very much a big deal on which side of 8 Mile you were born and lived. Inside 8 Mile you had real world credentials, outside you didn't. Young hip-hop artists compete in ""battles"" in which each person gets 45 seconds to ad lib to music; in that time they do their best to verbally annihilate their opponent. Winners are decided by crowd reaction; victory goes to those with quick wits, verbal capability, and a killer instinct. Jimmy Smith, Jr. (Eminem) has everything going against him in that environment: he's on the wrong side of 8 Mile, on top of which he's white, and he lives with his mother in a trailer park. All of which means, when he gets up on stage at a battle, he might as well have a big white target painted on his forehead.Jimmy's hip-hop alias is B. Rabbit. He has a dead-end, mind-numbingly boring job stamping auto body parts in a factory, an emotionally co-dependent mother (brilliantly played by Kim Basinger), a little sister he adores and wants to protect from the crime- and violence-ridden world in which they live, and the knowledge that he can't, and, unless something major changes, nothing to look forward to but more of the same until he dies of old age and a broken heart. His only possible salvation, the only thing that makes him special, is the music in his head. Problem: Jimmy's really a decent guy, very shy, and gets so nervous and intimidated at the battles he can't even speak, let alone win. Of course there are other conflicts to resolve - Jimmy's opponent in the movie's final ""battle"" is a gangbanger who, at one point in the film, has his crew hold Jimmy down while he puts a gun to Jimmy's head and threatens to kill him. But for all of that, in 8 Mile Jimmy's greatest battle is with himself, to find the determination and self-esteem to compete and win in the battles.It's irresistible to compare 8 Mile to Rocky. In both movies there's an event in which the main character's performance has become for him the defining moment in his life, the challenge he must overcome to have any sort of decent existence thereafter. In Rocky it's the exhibition fight with Apollo Creed. But Rocky has such a self-image as a loser, he doesn't kid himself, he knows he can't win, he's not even in Apollo's league, he just wants to go the distance. Rocky knows he's going to get beaten mostly to death, but if he's still on his feet at the end of the fight he'll feel like a winner. Jimmy Smith, Jr. doesn't have that mindset working for him....Jimmy's got to WIN.Eminem aka Marshall Mathers does a phenomenal job as B. Rabbit. He convincingly displays a wide range of emotions: despair, fear, anger, love, hate, courage, sensitivity, it's all right there on his face, scraped raw, mostly in the eyes. Throughout the entire movie I was just amazed at how good this guy was. With his fine features, pale skin, and amazingly blue eyes, Marshall Mathers in 8 Mile looks like a grounded, emotionally abused angel.It's tempting to regard 8 Mile as a fictionalized Eminem biography since the Detroit hip-hop battles were where he got his start. There's a small amount of truth to that. In the DVD's excellent ""making of"" featurette, Eminem says, ""We took some things that happened in my life and put 'em in the movie, and maybe twisted 'em a little bit, and added some things, and took out some things. Put it this way, if it was based on my life, then it would limit me to things I could do, and there would be certain guidelines we had to follow, but with this character, it's like, it's cool because I can do other things with him that ain't me.""This DVD has great ""extras,"" the standouts being the ""making of"" featurette and an uncensored music video of Eminem's song ""Superman.""One warning: this is not the movie for people who can't stand profanity. Most of the characters in 8 Mile think ""mother"" is half a word.""If you had one shot, one opportunity, to seize everything you ever wanted, for one moment, would you capture it, or just let it slip?""",5,A Hip-Hop Rocky,1094947200,"09 12, 2004",2004,4423,"['Okay', 'start', 'want', 'know', 'hip-hop', 'movie', 'starring', 'white', 'rapper', 'Eminem', 'time', 'Answer', 'oh', 'yes', 'Second', 'ask', 'How', 'good', 'was', 'Eminem', 'actor', 'Answer', ""'ll"", 'be', 'amazed.8', 'Mile', 'Road', 'Detroit', 'boundary', 'city', 'suburbs', 'time', 'movie', 'set', '1995', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'color', 'line', 'black', '8', 'Mile', 'white', 'outside', 'were', 'aspiring', 'hip-hop', 'singer', 'time', 'place', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'big', 'deal', 'side', '8', 'Mile', 'were', 'born', 'lived', '8', 'Mile', 'had', 'real', 'world', 'credentials', 'did', ""n't"", 'Young', 'hip-hop', 'artists', 'compete', 'battles', 'person', '45', 'seconds', 'ad', 'lib', 'music', 'time', 'do', 'best', 'verbally', 'annihilate', 'opponent', 'Winners', 'are', 'decided', 'crowd', 'reaction', 'victory', 'quick', 'wits', 'verbal', 'capability', 'killer', 'instinct', 'Jimmy', 'Smith', 'Jr.', 'Eminem', 'everything', 'going', 'environment', 'wrong', 'side', '8', 'Mile', 'top', 'white', 'mother', 'trailer', 'park', 'when', 'up', 'stage', 'battle', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'big', 'white', 'target', 'painted', 'forehead.Jimmy', 'hip-hop', 'alias', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'dead-end', 'mind-numbingly', 'boring', 'job', 'stamping', 'auto', 'body', 'parts', 'factory', 'emotionally', 'co-dependent', 'mother', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'little', 'sister', 'protect', 'crime-', 'violence-ridden', 'world', 'live', 'knowledge', 'ca', ""n't"", 'something', 'major', 'changes', 'nothing', 'look', 'forward', 'more', 'same', 'old', 'age', 'broken', 'heart', 'only', 'possible', 'salvation', 'only', 'thing', 'special', 'music', 'head', 'Problem', 'Jimmy', 'really', 'decent', 'guy', 'very', 'shy', 'so', 'nervous', 'intimidated', 'battles', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'speak', 'let', 'alone', 'win', 'course', 'are', 'other', 'conflicts', 'resolve', 'Jimmy', 'opponent', 'movie', 'final', 'battle', 'gangbanger', 'who', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'crew', 'hold', 'Jimmy', 'down', 'gun', 'Jimmy', 'head', 'kill', '8', 'Mile', 'Jimmy', 'greatest', 'battle', 'find', 'determination', 'self-esteem', 'compete', 'win', 'battles.It', 'irresistible', 'compare', '8', 'Mile', 'Rocky', 'movies', 'event', 'main', 'character', 'performance', 'become', 'defining', 'moment', 'life', 'challenge', 'must', 'overcome', 'have', 'sort', 'decent', 'existence', 'thereafter', 'Rocky', 'exhibition', 'fight', 'Apollo', 'Creed', 'Rocky', 'such', 'self-image', 'loser', ""n't"", 'kid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'win', 'not', 'even', 'Apollo', 'league', 'just', 'go', 'distance', 'Rocky', 'going', 'get', 'beaten', 'mostly', 'death', 'still', 'feet', 'end', 'fight', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'winner', 'Jimmy', 'Smith', 'Jr.', ""n't"", 'have', 'mindset', 'working', '.Jimmy', 'got', 'WIN.Eminem', 'aka', 'Marshall', 'Mathers', 'phenomenal', 'job', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'convincingly', 'wide', 'range', 'emotions', 'despair', 'fear', 'anger', 'love', 'hate', 'courage', 'sensitivity', 'all', 'right', 'face', 'scraped', 'raw', 'mostly', 'eyes', 'entire', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'amazed', 'how', 'good', 'guy', 'was', 'fine', 'features', 'pale', 'skin', 'amazingly', 'blue', 'eyes', 'Marshall', 'Mathers', '8', 'Mile', 'looks', 'grounded', 'emotionally', 'abused', 'angel.It', 'tempting', 'regard', '8', 'Mile', 'fictionalized', 'Eminem', 'biography', 'Detroit', 'hip-hop', 'battles', 'were', 'where', 'got', 'start', 'small', 'amount', 'truth', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'making', 'featurette', 'Eminem', 'took', 'things', 'happened', 'life', 'put', 'movie', 'maybe', 'twisted', 'little', 'bit', 'added', 'things', 'took', 'out', 'things', 'Put', 'way', 'was', 'based', 'life', 'then', 'would', 'limit', 'things', 'could', 'do', 'would', 'be', 'certain', 'guidelines', 'had', 'follow', 'character', 'cool', 'can', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'ai', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'great', 'extras', 'standouts', 'being', 'making', 'featurette', 'uncensored', 'music', 'video', 'Eminem', 'song', 'Superman', 'One', 'warning', 'not', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'profanity', 'Most', 'characters', '8', 'Mile', 'think', 'mother', 'word', 'had', 'one', 'shot', 'one', 'opportunity', 'seize', 'everything', 'ever', 'wanted', 'one', 'moment', 'would', 'capture', 'just', 'let', 'slip']",8 Mile

603233,AD6G5M3KL7GTB,B00005JLQE,Eric Smith,"[1, 3]","Don't believe all the hype.  ""8 Mile"" isn't an excellent movie.  It's good, don't get me wrong.  But it could've been better.  Controversial white rapper Eminem plays Jimmy (or ""Rabbit"" as hes called in the film) who lives in a Trailer Park with his daughter Lily and his Mom (Kim Bessenger). in Detroit.  He spends most of his time working at a car plant, very appropriate for Detroit of course.  But as we find out, that's only to make a living.  He just so happens to have mad rap skills.  His three friends keep the movie funny.  His best friend of the group it seems is David (or ""Future"") played by Mekhi Phifer (""Save The Last Dance"") who does an excellent job.  Rabbit attempts several times to try and rap in front of a crowd where he would be noticed for record deals, but ends up freezing on stage everytime because of the crowd's booing.  Eventually the plot thickens and a relationshjp with is Mom and Daughter grow. Rabbit also ends up meeting a girl with a similar background aspiring to become a model, played by newcomer actress Brittany Murphy.  This movie seemed at times to be ""Choppy"" in some parts, and the other non-famous actors didn't seem to do that well.  Oscar-nominated actress Kim Bessenger (""Bless The Child"", ""I Dreamed of Africa"") did a great job as Jimmy's mother.  The swearing in the movie was rather harsh and wouldn't be reccomended for anyone under 15.  Because this movie is semi-autobiographical (similar to Mariah's ""Glitter"" in that case), we get a glimpse into what was once Eminem's life.  After seeing this movie I also had a lot more respect for rappers who get popular by the streets as well as people who live in Trailer Parks.

603234,A3CRB8AHFDKWP4,B00005JLQE,Esteban,"[0, 0]","It's already been established long ago that Eminem is a true lyricist who can go bar for bar with any MC. With that being said, the question for someone who has never actually seen Eminem's acting may be, can he act well enough to pull off his own film? The answer to that question is definitely a solid yes. There are many rapper turned actors, and many of them are mediocre at best, but Eminem is one of the few who actually can convey what he is trying to in 8 Mile. It's probably because (with the exception of some name changes here and there) this movie was basically what his life was like before he became the rap phenomenon he is known as today.Eminem never came off like he was over-acting in this whole film. It seemed so real (maybe because it basically is). All B-Rabbit (and his boys, who will remind you of D12, Em's group in real life) want to do is get their big record deal, and be able to get out of 8 Mile. And to also not have to deal with his mom's abusive douchebag boyfriend Greg. The movie shows B-Rabbit/Eminem's passion for hip hop (some of the best scenes take place at the The Shelter), how he struggles day to day to make it in 8 Mile where he is frequently singled out and jumped for being a white rapper, protecting his little sister, and also dealing with his drug addicted and bipolar mother. Don't get me wrong I already did like Eminem, but once I saw this movie, I was really impressed because it does show real emotion and what it was like for Eminem to get to where he is today, but also has it's genuinely funny moments.

603235,A2TVVN2JWDAE8A,B00005JLQE,"E. Suter ""erindipity""","[0, 1]","Regardless of how you feel personally towards Eminem, his lyrics or Rap music in general, you must give the rapper credit where it is due.  He has an amazing ability to link words and rhymes to make you laugh at yourself, him and others.  His talent as a writer and rapper shine in this movie.Eminem plays a young man struggling to escape the poverty he was raised in.  Much of the story takes place at 8 Mile, a stereotypical trailer park in Detroit where Rabbit (Eminem) is forced to moved back home to when he leaves his pregnant girlfriend.  There he faces his mother's failings as both a parent and a human being, trying to shield a young sister from the horrors of life including his mother's drunken stupors and violence.His escape and dreams revolve around rap music.  Not being very familiar with this type of music myself, I found the battle scenes very interesting and they are without a doubt the best parts of the movie.  My favorite being an impromptu rap Rabbit creates with a friend to Sweet Home Alabama while trying to fix a car.  The humor and self mockery in the situation seem to sum up the whole movie.I would equate this movie with Saturday Night Fever.  The story line is very similar.  A struggling minority (as Rabbit would be one of the few whites attending these battles) facing poverty, growing up and facing his responsibilties.  I thing this movie may in a lot of ways bring some of the hidden aspects of hip hop life styles and rap battles to public light.One thing I will admit to being surprised about was the lack of swearing in this movie.  Don't get me wrong, the movie did have it's share, but there was not nearly as much as I had assumed there would be.  It is still not a movie for children though.I was disappointed with the character of Alix played by Brittany Murphy.  For the most part I really felt her role in the film was unnecessary and the sex scene was placed for shock value only.

I always recommend that anyone in the audience of any film look to the story, tyne script, the acting, and the production of the film. You will be hard pressed to find any of that here.Does, Eninem (Marshall Bruce Mathers, III) rap - yes; is he the first &#34;white boy&#34; to do so - no (try Vanilla Ice of seven years earlier for starters); is he rather angry - well, if you use the F*** word in the script as a measuring device he isn't angry he is just clueless!There is no doubt that there is a market for such &$#@! among the teenage/angst or 313 crowd but as far as presenting any &#34;socially redeeming qualities&#34;, this use of film and digits has set the bar to an all new low.Aside from the visceral regurgitation resulting from the film as a whole, there is the really poor quality of the script (see the 4-letter quotient mentioned above as an example), the overall story (where the &#34;clueless&#34; comment comes from), the absolutely low-brow usage of anything female (mother, former girlfriend, current squeeze, etc - and here I would suspect anything female that crawls), the level of gratuitous violence incorporated throughout; and the ludicrous refinement of Eminem using &#34;Thank you's&#34; and &#34;Please&#34; for the shock value as punctuation between the continuous string of F-words; just underscores how little value is actually present.Look real hard and you might even recognize that Kim Bassinger is attempting to play Eminem's mother - for whatever that role must have been worth. In short, acting was not the purpose of the film, rather it is merely a peon to a bunch of clueless people living clueless lives.Exposure to this film leaves nothing in its passing except dust and the long efforts necessary to reconstruct what this film trashes.

Well, I've never particularly cared for Rap music or it's Hip-Hop cousin. I don't mean to condemn the entire genre because I can enjoy a bit of it now and then and Eminem would rank as one of my favorite artists within that genre. After all, that's why I bought the DVD. But rap music just doesn't fit me. I'm more of a small town westerner than a big city ghetto dweller. Okay, okay, it has wider appeal, but there's a lot of people who just don't  care for it and I can understand their feelings.""8 mile""was an interesting movie in several different ways. Well, you've all heard of Detroit and several other big cities that are decaying with the demise of American manufacturing. Detroit is a particularly good example because of the dramatic changes in the automobile industry. It's lost 50% of it's population! Only a few decades ago, Detroit was one of America's great cities. Would you like to see Detroit at the ground level and on the mean streets? Well, viewing this movie is a way to do it. The urban decay is just appalling and serves as some kind of warning to all of us, if only we could read it.Rap music came in about in the late 70s. I expected it to be a short-term fad that would fade after a few years, but I was dead wrong. Rap is still with us 35 years later and is still going strong. Where did it come from? What is it like at the real base level? What's it like at a street level rap performance? Well, this movie provides a lot of views for these type of questions. Rap came out of the big city ghettos where most of the inhabitants were African American. It came out of the F-bomb dialect of American English and is harsh and grating on the ears. It's a brash and bombastic music that aggressively pushes itself into your face. Want to know what rap is like at the street level? ""8 mile"" is a fairly good depiction, I would guess. Well, who am I to say, standing on the distant sidelines?In any case, Eminem is a white Rapper from the Detroit area and he plays a white Rapper from the Detroit area working himself into the distant dream of gaining a recording contract. The movie documents his living conditions and rise through his associates on his way to ultimate stardom. Very interesting! Without question!

Curtis Hanson is the man behind the camera here, and his past work in acclaimed movies like ""Wonder Boys"" or ""L.A. Confidential"" gave him enough knowledge and recognition to get his hands on this project.The story isn`t too original, but is well told and acted. Eminem plays Rabbit, a youngster from a Detroit neighbourhood with a messed life who`s trying to find his role in the world. His main passion is hip hop, so he looks to find his future in music, getting away from a life with low perspectives and choices.Hanson captures well Rabbit`s story and the atmosphere of the community he lives in, showing the conflicts he must face to achieve his goal. The realistic direction and the gritty, dark photography add a natural, credible tone to the movie, showing how`s life in those convulted suburbs. The plot is deep enough and never gets too melodramatic or politically correct, despite the somewhat preachy and predictable ending.Not a masterpiece, but given that most films with or about musicians are generally weak, ""8 Mile"" stands above average and succeeds delivering a tension-filled and well-written story, with characters worth caring about.

Followers of Curtis Hanson like me may be less enthusiastic. The film is certainly interesting and well made, but lacks the mix of excitement, tension, mystery, comedy, sex, drama and star performances that makes LA Confidential interesting to watch over and over again. Eminem plays Jimmy's, whose relationships with his friends, family, workmates and girlfriends are well handled, as are his efforts to break into the commercial world of Rap music. But this is all quite low-key stuff compared with the dazzle of LA Confidential. And Detroit at night or gloomy daylight is at the opposite end of the USA to sunny Los Angeles.  Maybe there lies a clue to why Curtis Hanson chose to make this film.

Fortunately for this film, Eminem is one of the few musicians who can act!!!

He's also sort of an aspiring rap artist, participating (but never having the guts to stand up in front of everyone) in rap battles both in a club and on the streets.Eminem gives  a very well-done performance as the lead character and Kim Basinger and Brittany Murphy back the film with wonderful supporting acting. I loved how 8 Mile gives a realistic (if not slightly stylized) look at low-class life in a big city. The film is never shy of revealing the raw truth to you.

When I first heard ""The Real Slim Shady"" on the radio that summer, I honestly thought it was some kind of practical joke.  Could anyone's voice really be that nasal?Of course, the joke was on me.  The joke's on everyone when it comes to Eminem.  The morning that ""8 Mile"" came out, I heard two radio hosts in New York City (a right-wing social crusader, and a left-wing civil rights lawyer) debating Eminem.  One host decried Eminem, while the other lauded him, and it's not hard to figure out which host took which side.  Obviously, once I heard the debate phrased in those terms, I simply had to go see the film.""8 Mile"" is well worth owning on DVD -- if nothing else, for those of us less than fluent in hip-hop, the English subtitles make the movie remarkably easier to understand.  In the theater, the film was inspirational, without being hokey.  It stands up to repeated viewings, which is the mark of a truly good film.  Director Curtis Hanson has made increasingly solid movies throughout his career (his early ""The Little Dragons"" was banned to the purgatory of monthly airings on the Lifetime Network in the late '80s; now he's an Oscar winner) and in ""8 Mile"" he pushes all the right buttons without ever producing anything phony.The magic element that makes ""8 Mile"" hang together is Eminem... of course.  Rabbit's an anti-hero, who picks a fight every ten minutes and loses most of them.  His film romance (with Brittany Murphy) is limited to an erotic encounter in an auto-stamping factory; the would-be couple's romantic gesture involves the middle finger.  If you're expecting ""8 Mile"" to conclude with a triumphant record deal and a marriage proposal, you're in the wrong theater.The supporting cast in ""8"" mile is also notable.  Mekhi Phifer, who first came to my attention with an explosive recurring role on the penultimate season of ""Homicide"", is outstanding as Rabbit's hip-hop mentor and would-be sponsor.  Someone named Evan Jones is quite likeable as ""Cheddar Bob"", quite possibly the dumbest sidekick to appear in a movie since Steve Buscemi in ""The Big Lebowski"".  Sample exchange: ""I need some privacy."" ""Can I come with you?"".  The third notable character is Detroit itself.  Here's one of the bleakest movie landscapes ever, and it's all filmed ""entirely on location in the 313"", as the film's credits tell us.The extras are a little weak.  The ""making of"" featurette runs just 10 minutes and doesn't seem to involve any original contribution by Eminem himself.  Well done, however, is the music soundtrack options, which all you to jump directly to the scene in the movie in which a particular song appears.  You can also watch the film's excellent freestyle battles this way.The finest feature on the disc is a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the freestyle battles.  Here we see the ""American Idol""-style selection process of four extras who'll get to actually battle Eminem in the movie.  The feature is all the more  riveting for the fact that this sequence didn't make the final cut.  This feature is the closest that the ""8 Mile"" DVD comes to actually penetrating Eminem's barriers and getting a look at the real man himself.",4,8 days on the 8 Mile,1052611200,"05 11, 2003",2003,3287,"['have', 'admit', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'who', 'Eminem', 'was', 'Marshall', 'Mathers', 'LP', 'came', 'out', 'summer', '2000', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'Real', 'Slim', 'Shady', 'radio', 'summer', 'honestly', 'thought', 'was', 'kind', 'practical', 'joke', 'Could', 'anyone', 'voice', 'really', 'be', 'nasal', 'course', 'joke', 'was', 'joke', 'everyone', 'when', 'Eminem', 'morning', '8', 'Mile', 'came', 'heard', 'two', 'radio', 'hosts', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'right-wing', 'social', 'crusader', 'left-wing', 'civil', 'rights', 'lawyer', 'debating', 'Eminem', 'One', 'host', 'decried', 'Eminem', 'other', 'lauded', 'not', 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'host', 'took', 'side', 'Obviously', 'once', 'heard', 'debate', 'phrased', 'terms', 'simply', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'film', '8', 'Mile', 'well', 'worth', 'owning', 'DVD', 'nothing', 'else', 'less', 'fluent', 'hip-hop', 'English', 'subtitles', 'make', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'easier', 'understand', 'theater', 'film', 'was', 'inspirational', 'being', 'hokey', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'mark', 'truly', 'good', 'film', 'Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'made', 'increasingly', 'solid', 'movies', 'career', 'early', 'Little', 'Dragons', 'was', 'banned', 'purgatory', 'monthly', 'airings', 'Lifetime', 'Network', 'late', ""'80s"", 'now', 'Oscar', 'winner', '8', 'Mile', 'right', 'buttons', 'ever', 'producing', 'anything', 'phony.The', 'magic', 'element', '8', 'Mile', 'hang', 'together', 'Eminem', 'course', 'Rabbit', 'anti-hero', 'who', 'fight', 'ten', 'minutes', 'most', 'film', 'romance', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'limited', 'erotic', 'encounter', 'auto-stamping', 'factory', 'would-be', 'couple', 'romantic', 'gesture', 'middle', 'finger', ""'re"", 'expecting', '8', 'Mile', 'conclude', 'triumphant', 'record', 'deal', 'marriage', 'proposal', ""'re"", 'wrong', 'theater.The', 'supporting', 'cast', '8', 'mile', 'also', 'notable', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'who', 'first', 'came', 'attention', 'explosive', 'recurring', 'role', 'penultimate', 'season', 'Homicide', 'outstanding', 'Rabbit', 'hip-hop', 'mentor', 'would-be', 'sponsor', 'Someone', 'named', 'Evan', 'Jones', 'quite', 'likeable', 'Cheddar', 'Bob', 'quite', 'possibly', 'dumbest', 'sidekick', 'appear', 'movie', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'Sample', 'exchange', 'need', 'privacy', 'Can', 'come', 'third', 'notable', 'character', 'Detroit', 'Here', 'one', 'bleakest', 'movie', 'ever', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'location', '313', 'film', 'credits', 'tell', 'us.The', 'extras', 'are', 'little', 'weak', 'making', 'featurette', 'just', '10', 'minutes', ""n't"", 'seem', 'involve', 'original', 'contribution', 'Eminem', 'Well', 'done', 'however', 'music', 'soundtrack', 'options', 'jump', 'directly', 'scene', 'movie', 'particular', 'song', 'can', 'also', 'watch', 'film', 'excellent', 'freestyle', 'battles', 'way.The', 'finest', 'feature', 'disc', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'filming', 'freestyle', 'battles', 'Here', 'see', 'American', 'Idol', '-style', 'selection', 'process', 'four', 'extras', 'who', ""'ll"", 'get', 'actually', 'battle', 'Eminem', 'movie', 'feature', 'more', 'riveting', 'fact', 'sequence', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'final', 'cut', 'feature', 'closest', '8', 'Mile', 'DVD', 'actually', 'penetrating', 'Eminem', 'barriers', 'getting', 'look', 'real', 'man']",8 Mile
603255,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,B00005JLQE,Jason N. Mical,"[1, 2]","It's been little more than a year since Mariah Carey proved ""Glitter"" is not gold.  A mere seven months have passed since Britney's ""Crossroads"" experience summed up the destruction of 40 years worth of feminist progress.  And now Eminem, rap's bad, white guy, takes a drive down ""8 Mile,"" making a case that he's both a serious artist and a serious actor.  Critics argue he is neither; whether it's the PC crowd from the left or the ""gotta be offended at something"" crowd from the right, it's easy to hate someone who presents such an easy target.  But, like Elvis, a figure Eminem references several times in his songs, he continues to appeal to youth and upset the adults, all while making oodles of money and, now, films worthy of praise.""8 Mile"" (the name refers to the road in Detroit that separates the white suburbs from the black inner-city) showcases a week in the life of wannabe rapper Rabbit.  Like Eminem, Rabbit fights for respect in the black-dominated rap underground.  Like Eminem, Rabbit lives with his mother in a trailer park.  And like Em, Rabbit is desperate for a way to get out.  His friends encourage him to become involved with ""battles,"" 45-second freestyle raps where two contestants try to insult each other, and the best insults win.  Although Rabbit readily lets his rhymes slip at work and at play, when it's crunch time, he chokes.  The movie opens with Rabbit blowing a contest, and then stumbling home to explain to his alcoholic mother (a perfectly cast Kim Bassinger) that he broke up with his ""pregnant"" girlfriend and gave her the car.The movie then moves through a series of vignettes - Rabbit at work, Rabbit at play, Rabbit in love, Rabbit rapping - with the desperation of his situation tightening like choke-collar.  The ""plot"" is loose at best; ""8 Mile"" could best be described as a slice-of-life with a ""Rocky""-like ending (like we didn't know that was coming).  The utter poverty and hopelessness which pervades the film is superceded by a single ray of hope: that there may be a way, through talent, to rise above the cycle of poverty that has dragged every one of Rabbit's friends and family into despair.  It finally becomes a decision between working overtime for guaranteed cash, or taking a risk and aiming for something more - a choice that any creative person will recognize.""8 Mile"" works because it ignores its star and stays true to the spirit of creativity.  What could easily have been a ""look at me"" movie for Eminem remains a ""look at THIS' movie about creative people trapped in the worst of urban conditions.  The ending of the film does not have Rabbit signing a multi-million dollar record deal, or marrying the girl, or becoming a superstar.

603256,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,B00005JLQE,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[4, 4]","Now, I don't expect everyone to love 8 MILE, but I think there are a lot of people out there who'd be surprised if they give the film a shot. I know there's a lot of anti-Eminem people out there and rightly so. I can see why you would hate the man. However, love him or hate him he delivers a heart felt performance here. Those who are saying `8 Mile' shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style' introduced us to hip-hop. But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language. Perhaps his CD's contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren't stone deaf.His closest relationship in this movie is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men's room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it's what a young man has to do: get on friendly working terms with who he is. The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene. Eminem as shown in `8 Mile' isn't totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained. He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it -- to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom's sleazy boyfriend. It's his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen. Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us. His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn't put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it. ""8 Mile"" isn't just a vehicle for Eminem. It's too well made a movie to be that. But without Eminem `8 Mile' wouldn't exist. The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future' is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them. You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.`8 Mile' cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic. There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star. The whole focus is on his personality and in particular his stillness. The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike. Even when he chooses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power. In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.This rapper is good just standing there.",3,Director Curtis Hanson's done a good job  on this film.,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,3156,"['Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'everyone', 'love', '8', 'MILE', 'think', 'are', 'lot', 'people', 'who', ""'d"", 'be', 'surprised', 'give', 'film', 'shot', 'know', 'lot', 'anti-Eminem', 'people', 'there', 'rightly', 'so', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'would', 'hate', 'man', 'However', 'love', 'hate', 'heart', 'felt', 'performance', 'here', 'who', 'are', 'saying', '8', 'Mile', 'vanilla-ed', 'Eminem', 'may', 'have', 'point', 'movie', 'non-rap', 'audience', 'just', 'Wild', 'Style', 'introduced', 'hip-hop', 'who', 'say', 'Eminem', 'sanitized', 'here', 'mall', 'viewing', 'have', 'odd', 'notion', 'language', 'Perhaps', 'CD', 'contain', 'more', 'inflammatory', 'material', 'aired', 'movie', 'what', 'said', 'here', 'most', 'definitely', 'not', 'suburban', 'grandmothers', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'stone', 'deaf.His', 'closest', 'relationship', 'movie', 'clear', 'first', 'scene', 'where', 'Eminem', 'doing', 'rap', 'gestures', 'competition', 'shed', 'men', 'room', 'looking', 'mirror', 'hearing', 'music', 'head', 'fine', 'what', 'young', 'man', 'do', 'get', 'friendly', 'working', 'terms', 'who', 'movie', 'going', 'off', 'be', 'own', 'give', 'up', 'rowdy', 'become', 'winner', 'walks', 'off', 'final', 'scene', 'Eminem', 'shown', '8', 'Mile', ""n't"", 'totally', 'motivated', 'anger', 'anger', 'very', 'contained', 'able', 'turn', 'off', 'will', 'release', 'only', 'when', 'trounce', 'rap', 'competition', 'throw', 'out', 'mom', 'sleazy', 'boyfriend', 'ability', 'control', 'anger', 'Rabbit', 'Eminem', 'winners.Eminem', 'have', 'authenticity', 'strong', 'presence', 'screen', 'Paradoxically', 'projects', 'powerful', 'inwardness', 'turning', 'away', 'everybody', 'face', 'jump', 'out', 'effect', 'authenticity', ""n't"", 'put', 'reaction', 'please', 'audience', 'suit', 'scene', 'always', 'there', 'moving', 'scene', 'fact', 'creating', '8', 'Mile', ""n't"", 'just', 'vehicle', 'Eminem', 'too', 'well', 'made', 'movie', 'be', 'Eminem', '8', 'Mile', 'would', ""n't"", 'exist', 'only', 'importance', 'rapping', 'contests', 'emceed', 'Future', 'first', 'Rabbit', 'shies', 'away', 'then', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'rapper/actors', 'feel', 'who', 'are', 'movie', 'only', 'be', 'put', 'down', 'Eminem.', '8', 'Mile', 'can', 'not', 'escape', 'limitations', 'fictionalized', 'star', 'biopic', 'have', 'been', 'dozens', 'movies', 'emerging', 'music', 'stars', 'families', 'early', 'sponsors', 'first', 'big', 'breaks', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'range', 'specificity', 'detail', 'one', 'movie', 'only', 'hero', 'moment', 'when', 'away', 'having', 'shown', 'can', 'be', 'star', 'whole', 'focus', 'personality', 'particular', 'stillness', 'most', 'important', 'moments', 'are', 'when', 'Rabbit/Eminem', 'mike', 'hand', 'silent', 'waiting', 'inspiration', 'strike', 'Even', 'when', 'not', 'compete', 'mike', 'back', 'moment', 'full', 'power', 'movie', 'Eminem', 'expression', 'sheer', 'imminence', 'raw', 'potential', 'new', 'level', 'clarity', 'confidence.This', 'rapper', 'good', 'just', 'standing', 'there']",8 Mile

Every two, no make that, one minute, you saw the ads of worldwide pop icon Eminem with his hood up while ""Lose Yourself"" is played in the background. Add to that, a huge overplayed hit(the aforemetioned title above) and Eminem's megastardom, the hype machine went into overload.But with most Eminem work, a natural curiosity brewed up. So you'd think that things would be actually intresting.NOT!I actually was personally suprised how boring ""8 Mile"" is. With all the hype and all the mouth of Em, I thought things would be lively. But I was wrong. In fact,""8 Mile"" seems like every standard urban drama just with more gloss. Eminem does a good enough take as ""Rabbit"", the film's down-on-his-luck hero which is based of course on the star's real life. And you already know the whole plot but I mean, aside from some of the freestyle battles which capture some real enegery and some of the great 1995-era rap played(vintage Biggie; Mobb Deep; etc.), there's nothing in ""8 Mile"" to stand out.

It was the perfect setting to watch 8 Mile .The premise of 8 Mile is that Eminem plays an aspiring young white rapper nicknamed Bunny Rabbit. B Rabbit just broke up with his girlfriend and moves back into his mother's trailer. He is known to be the most talented rapper from his circle of friends, but froze onstage at a rap battle at the movie's opening. The movie supposedly mirrors much of what happened in Eminem's real life.While i know that Eminem is an incredibly talented rapper, and enjoy the radio versions of his singles, I'm not a big fan of the conent of his albums. So why did i want to see this movie? It is directed by Curtis Hanson. Having Hanson at the helm raises the quality level of the film and eases much of my skepticism about how good this movie really could be. After L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys , i knew i had nothing to fear.I was not disappointed. 8 Mile is not merely good, it is excellent. Eminem may never make another movie, but in 8 Mile he is the real deal. His acting is fantastic and he lends credibility to B Rabbit when he must rap (and rap well). This is his first movie, and he is being asked to carry the picture.

603265,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00005JLQE,Joker,"[1, 1]","For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this movie...I saw 8 Mile (2002) in the theater when it came out.  I'm finally reviewing it!  For anybody who isn't from the Detroit area or doesn't know much about this movie and its title, 8 Mile stands for 8 Mile Rd., which is the dividing line or northern border of Detroit.  South of 8 Mile Rd. is Detroit; north of 8 Mile Rd. is the suburbs.  Anyway, 8 Mile is a movie about a rapper from the hood who tries to get somewhere in the world of rap music.  Along the way, he participates in rapping contests at various Detroit nightclubs.  Does he succeed?  Watch to find out.This movie is raw, edgy, full of profanity, and very much reality-based.  It's loosely based on Marshall Mathers' (Eminem's) life.  Eminem does a good job acting.  The music throughout the movie fits the scenes very well.  Brittany Murphy's acting was good as well.  Kim Basinger was OK as Eminem's mother, but her hairstyle seemed too current and neat for the character she was playing (just my opinion).  This movie manages to pull this viewer into the story.

He takes a job at a steel plant so he can save up money for studio time. He fights off gang members and has the help of his friend future. It is loosely based on Eminem's life.Eminem is quite the rap star today. He has sold millions of copies of cdsthat are excellent hip hip masterpieces. He has taken the world by storm and shown that White people can rap. But, he stretches himself and his persona into this movie and the movie itself is surprisingly simple and easy to watch. It doesn't seem like a biography movie because the character's names aren't the same as the real person's name. Probably, Eminem didn't want the movie to be like a ""Eminem can act"" vehicle for him. He had already shown his rapping skills and enforced them through out the movie, but he does pull off a good performance as B-rabbit.Curtis Hanson, who I find to be a okay director, seemingly could've been out of place in the hip hop culture but his direction works well with the atmosphere and location of the movie as the film as the film moves along at a fast pace set by his direction. He gets the performances out of the characters that were needed. He doesn't oversell the characters or oversap them so that they become these cheesy characters. You feel for the characters after you are done watching the movie. Curtis Hanson defines the character by the way he is portrayed on screen. We see his actions and we ulitametely root for him in the end as the credits roll and we hear lose yourself by Eminem. The movie then either sinks in or just leaves your mind and body as fast as it entered. it is one of those movies where you have to appreciate the hip hop culture and understand it to watch the movie, or otherwise you would feel incredibly lost in the mist of the movie and you will leave scratching your head and wondering what you have just watched.

So,recently I saw this movie for like the 50eth time. I still really like this movie. Eminem is one of the few singers who can seamlessly cross over from singing to acting. I do however think that we will probably never see Eminem in another movie. The only reason I saw this movie was due to the fact that I liked Eminem, but the movie holds on its own, but Eminem does real well. I've read a couple reviews where people said: ""Oh, Eminem is just playing himself, it's not even a performance.""  In a sense he is playing himself. But what people don't realize is that playing yourself is sometimes harder to do then playing someone else. This movie is very very loosely based on accounts in Eminems life, so people need to stop saying its a biography. It's NOT! Anyway, Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr, or Jimmy, orRabbit, or B-Rabbit, or yet again, Bunny Rabbit. Rabbit is (obviously) a white rapper living in Detroit who heads to the Shelter, a rap club, almost every night and gets stage fright, or chokes. Whatever you want to call it. The only person who sees how talented Rabbit really is, is Future(Mekhi Phifer,Dawn of the Dead). Future is kind of Rabbits mentor. Like Mr.Miyagi was to Daniel in ""The Karate Kid"". Rabbit lives at home with his mom (Kim Basinger, The Door in the Floor) and his sister Lilly. The sister is semi-based on Eminems daughter Hailie. He works at a stamping factory and thats where he meetsAlex (Brittany Murphy, Little Black Book). Alex is kind of a free spirited...Sl*t. To say the least ya know. So, we have:Rabbits Mom: Based on Ems Mom. Except the love in this movie is a lot stronger.Alex: Seems to be a little like Kim. Anyone?Lilly:Hailie?So, yes. In a sense its a biography. But this is a very entertaining and terrific film. You don't have to like rap, you don't have to like Eminem.

603269,A1NH820E5UDAZ0,B00005JLQE,"J. Williams ""j_bird""","[1, 2]","The movie starts off beautifully.  Rabit (Eminem) is in a restroom getting ready to enter a freestyle battle.  He has on headphones blasting ""Mobb Deep's"" ""Shook One's Pt II"" I'm not a big Mobb fan, but that song is nice, the beat pure fire to freestyle over.  The song makes a nice intro, to an overall decent movie. Better then decent, if you consider this is Em's first attempt at real acting.  The cast fits well here.  My favorite support character is ""Cheddar Bob"" he seems to be a bit slow mentally.  He add's some really funny moments with a few of his lines.  It's especially funny when the rest of his crew is bad mouthing ""Free World"" under their breaths, and Cheddar blurts it out, starting a near riot between the rival clicks. He is the out of place man in their crew ""313""  The rest of the crew besides ""Cheddar"" are supposed to be emcees too, but you never really get to see it, except for a moment in a parking lot scene.  I'm a long time Em fan, but even those who aren't, pretty much know the basics of the movie.  The story is well told, and well acted.  I would have liked for it to have had more ""battle"" scenes.  But they had to make the movie where it could appeal to everyone I suppose.  I also find it hard to believe Kim Basinger as a trailer park trash mom. But she a remarkable job here.  The friction between Rabbit and his mom and her boyfriend. Who just happens to be one of Rabbits old school mate, is very belivable.  Rabbit doesn't like him, and especially doesn't like the fact his mother is with a man who is his age.  The movie does however, drag at points.  There are some shots of drug usage, and sex (but no visable nudity) and of course a bunch of explicits.  But it's not would I would consider a bad movie.  The drug use, and the sex aren't displayed in a way where they're being promoted. They are just a part of the story.Could this movie have been better? Of course, but show me one that couldn't.  Em does a wonderful job playing Jimmy ""Rabbit"" even if this is loosely based on his life.  He still did a fine job ""acting""  And true to the real man, the majority of emotion he displays is anger and hatred.  The scenes with him and his little sister ""Lilly"" though, are very touching.  Again, they mimic his relationship with his daughter ""Halley"" showing, that while he has issues, he really isn't that bad of a guy.  I especially found the one's where he was fighting with his mom boyfriend. And afterwards saw his sis in the corner frighted to have a very real feel to them.  He didn't want her exposed to anything bad, and did whatever he could to keep her away from harm and having to witniss the negative side of life.  With how it ended, I could see a sequal. I'm sure the studio is all for the idea. But somehow, I doubt that Em is going to be up for it. He didn't do this movie for the money, and he didn't do it because he wanted to be an actor. He did it because it was a role he related to, and in an indirect way it told his life story of growing up on ""8 mile"" road in Detriot.  Even if you don't like hip-hop music, I suggest you give this movie a try.

Norman ""li'l rock & roller""","[53, 101]","Having grown up on 7 Mile (well, OK, far enough west of Detroit to own a horse) and with recommendations not only from 15-year-olds but my higher-ups at work, I was pretty curious to see this movie.  Besides,  ""Lose Yourself"" had already won my heart. Too bad ""8 Mile"" is not a full representation of that song, in all its angst and anxious ambition.The plot (what there is of one) has already been thoroughly discussed in prior reviews (B. Rabbit, resident of the ""uncool"" burbs north of 8 Mile, chokes during his first rap face-off, meets a girl, hangs out with his  buds from the cool, burnt-out slums south of 8 Mile, and eventually blows away the crowd with a rap worthy of Slim Shady hisself.)Actually, there is a great deal of potential in this story, which is the greatest disappointment.The rap scenes are great, unsurprisingly.  My favorite is the informal contest Rabbit gets into on a lunch break at the factory. And he's not Sir Laurence Olivier, but Mr. Mathers scores somewhere between Elvis and Madonna on the ""Sure, the kid can sell CDs but can he act?"" applause-o-meter. Anyway, you don't watch Eminem in a movie to watch him act, I presume;  you go to hear him rap.The other scenes are very difficult to either sit through, or understand.  For example, Kim Basinger is downright embarrassing as Rabbit's mom.  Just what we need: a movie enforcing more stereotypes, like the welfare mom in a trailer who is oversexed, neglects her kids, and has a fake southern accent (in Michigan?).  And it took the whole movie for me to figure out that ""the 810"" and ""the 313"" refer to area codes...and I LIVE here!  The rest of Rabbit's friends' dialogue flew by so fast I frequently was lost in the dust.Finally, the values promoted in the film seem at cross purposes.  Rabbit stands for loyalty, both to his friends and his family (even his wayward mom), trying to shield his sister from the violence that comes his way in the film.  But after his girlfriend flippantly cheats on him, her re-entrance into his life without remorse or forgiveness is completely unexplained.  (did a major scene get cut?) So is loyalty important, or not? And anger about urban blight leads to the gang burning down an abandoned, burned out house where they've learned someone was raped.  No consequences ensue.  The sentiments are understandable, but it would have been more interesting to at least touch on the fact that commiting a felony could leave a young life in ruins.  The film never addresses the subject again.So, when he's rapping, the star shines.  When he's not, the script is confusing.For Eminem devotees only.

I&#65533;m walking home with a copy of Eminem&#65533;s star vehicle &#65533;8 Mile&#65533; under my arm.  The rental guy knows me pretty well, and he looked at me funny when he saw me renting it.  He knows what I think of rap in general, and Eminem in particular.  Still, I have to see what all the brouhaha is about, so here, let&#65533;s play this bad boy.We start with Eminem himself in a bathroom, getting ready to go rap.  Oh, and we start with the new hip way of shocking an audience: live barf on screen.  I didn&#65533;t need to see that.But it&#65533;s getting better already.  After a biographical aside into Eminem&#65533;s character, Jimmy Smith, Jr., a.k.a. Bunny Rabbit, we get a shot of him onstage at a rap duel.  Seems all he wants is a fair shake, and his best bet for getting it is to be able to create better art than anybody else.  He and his crew are looking to face down another group, the Leaders of the Free World, led by one Papa Doc (!).  Sadly, onstage, B. Rabbit chokes, and then, well, so much for his hopes.The movie, as it turns out, covers one week in B. Rabbit&#65533;s life as he&#65533;s forced to move back home with his mother, accept a demeaning job, break up with a shaky girlfriend, and try to rebuild his life.  All he wants is the respect due a man, and all he gets is slapped down coming and going.  His rap is the only thing he has, and he&#65533;s coming more and more to realize it.B. Rabbit is a white man in a black man&#65533;s world, so he loses coming and going.  He has the support of a few friends, and he meets a heck of a girl, but only progressively does he come into himself.  He&#65533;s offered a chance at a recording deal, but the man who offers it talks out of both sides of his mouth, and it&#65533;s hard to tell what to believe out of him.Brittany Murphy plays his girl, but she seems to be along mostly as a plot device.  Her character isn&#65533;t much fleshed out, and while she provides something for Eminem to fight for, she seems vague throughout most of the movie.  There&#65533;s also a wholly unnecessary scene in which we watch Murphy and Eminem have sex.  This forwards the story not at all, and it&#65533;s done in very unromantic tones besides, as though Murphy is there to provide sex on demand for our hero.  Okay, Brittany Murphy is a good-looking young woman.  Great.  But you don&#65533;t need to prove it to us in exacting detail!This film appears to be partly autobiographical on Eminem&#65533;s part, but there are some inconsistencies.  In his music, Eminem has openly attacked and berated his mother, yet B. Rabbit loves his mom, played by Kim Basinger.  (Notably, we are able simultaneously to believe that Basinger is old enough to be Eminem&#65533;s mother and sensual enough to have a boyfriend her son&#65533;s age.)  B. Rabbit also busts a rhyme to defend a gay co-worker from insult &#65533; this from the artist who declared his dislike for homosexuals, then gave Elton John a big bunny hug live at the Grammies.  Will the real Slim Shady please stand up, indeed.In part, this film is wish-fulfillment for Eminem, but it&#65533;s not the apotheosis we might be led to expect.  It ends, not with the hero being made a star, as rock movies often do, but with our hero realizing he has a long row to hoe and that he needs to get back to work.  This demonstrates a distinct maturity on Eminem&#65533;s part, and a definite clear head for the writer and director.So what do I tell the rental guy?  Do I suddenly like Eminem?  Naw, I wouldn&#65533;t go that far.  However, there may be more to him than I previously gave him credit for.  Maybe it&#65533;s time for me to open my mind and re-evaluate him a little.",4,Who Knew?,1050192000,"04 13, 2003",2003,3757,"['Okay', 'can', '65533', 't', 'believe', '65533', 'm', 'doing', '65533', 'm', 'walking', 'home', 'copy', 'Eminem', '65533', 's', 'star', 'vehicle', '65533', '8', 'Mile', '65533', 'arm', 'rental', 'guy', 'pretty', 'well', 'looked', 'funny', 'when', 'saw', 'renting', 'what', 'think', 'rap', 'general', 'Eminem', 'particular', 'Still', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'brouhaha', 'about', 'so', 'here', 'let', '65533', 's', 'play', 'bad', 'boy.We', 'start', 'Eminem', 'bathroom', 'getting', 'ready', 'go', 'rap', 'Oh', 'start', 'new', 'hip', 'way', 'shocking', 'audience', 'live', 'barf', 'screen', 'didn', '65533', 't', 'need', 'see', '65533', 's', 'getting', 'better', 'already', 'biographical', 'aside', 'Eminem', '65533', 's', 'character', 'Jimmy', 'Smith', 'Jr.', 'a.k.a', 'Bunny', 'Rabbit', 'get', 'shot', 'onstage', 'rap', 'duel', 'fair', 'shake', 'best', 'bet', 'getting', 'be', 'able', 'create', 'better', 'art', 'anybody', 'else', 'crew', 'are', 'looking', 'face', 'down', 'group', 'Leaders', 'Free', 'World', 'led', 'one', 'Papa', 'Doc', 'Sadly', 'onstage', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'chokes', 'then', 'well', 'so', 'much', 'hopes.The', 'movie', 'out', 'one', 'week', 'B.', 'Rabbit', '65533', 's', 'life', '65533', 's', 'forced', 'move', 'back', 'home', 'mother', 'demeaning', 'job', 'break', 'up', 'shaky', 'girlfriend', 'try', 'rebuild', 'life', 'respect', 'due', 'man', 'slapped', 'coming', 'going', 'rap', 'only', 'thing', '65533', 'coming', 'more', 'more', 'realize', 'it.B', 'Rabbit', 'white', 'man', 'black', 'man', '65533', 's', 'world', 'coming', 'going', 'support', 'few', 'friends', 'heck', 'girl', 'only', 'progressively', 'come', '65533', 's', 'offered', 'chance', 'recording', 'deal', 'man', 'who', 'sides', 'mouth', '65533', 's', 'hard', 'tell', 'what', 'believe', 'him.Brittany', 'Murphy', 'girl', 'be', 'along', 'mostly', 'plot', 'device', 'character', 'isn', '65533', 't', 'much', 'fleshed', 'out', 'something', 'Eminem', 'fight', 'vague', 'most', 'movie', '65533', 's', 'also', 'wholly', 'unnecessary', 'scene', 'watch', 'Murphy', 'Eminem', 'have', 'sex', 'story', 'not', '65533', 's', 'done', 'very', 'unromantic', 'tones', 'besides', 'Murphy', 'there', 'provide', 'sex', 'demand', 'hero', 'Okay', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'good-looking', 'young', 'woman', 'Great', 'don', '65533', 't', 'need', 'prove', 'exacting', 'detail', 'film', 'be', 'partly', 'autobiographical', 'Eminem', '65533', 's', 'part', 'are', 'inconsistencies', 'music', 'Eminem', 'openly', 'attacked', 'berated', 'mother', 'yet', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'mom', 'played', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Notably', 'are', 'able', 'simultaneously', 'believe', 'Basinger', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'Eminem', '65533', 'mother', 'sensual', 'enough', 'have', 'boyfriend', 'son', '65533', 's', 'age', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'also', 'rhyme', 'defend', 'gay', 'co-worker', 'insult', '65533', 'artist', 'who', 'declared', 'dislike', 'homosexuals', 'then', 'gave', 'Elton', 'John', 'big', 'bunny', 'hug', 'live', 'Grammies', 'Will', 'real', 'Slim', 'Shady', 'please', 'stand', 'up', 'indeed.In', 'part', 'film', 'wish-fulfillment', 'Eminem', '65533', 'not', 'apotheosis', 'might', 'be', 'led', 'expect', 'not', 'hero', 'being', 'made', 'star', 'rock', 'movies', 'often', 'do', 'hero', 'realizing', 'long', 'row', 'hoe', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'distinct', 'maturity', 'Eminem', '65533', 's', 'part', 'definite', 'clear', 'head', 'writer', 'director.So', 'what', 'do', 'tell', 'rental', 'guy', 'Do', 'suddenly', 'Eminem', 'Naw', 'wouldn', '65533', 't', 'go', 'far', 'However', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'previously', 'gave', 'credit', 'Maybe', '65533', 's', 'time', 'open', 'mind', 're-evaluate', 'little']",8 Mile

However, his performance in ""8 Mile,"" along with the compelling plotline of growing up in a tough, primarily black neighborhood as a white kid, made me respect him a little more than I have in the past.  The story shows us the trials and tribulations of a white kid growing up in a broken home with an alcholic mother in a rundown trailer park.  He faces poverty, racism, abuse from his mother and a myriad of others, as well as the typical doubts of a young man on the edge of adulthood.  This entire film is played out like a country song in rap mode.This is a very fine story.  If you can look beyond the vulgar language(acceptable in this atmosphere), you'll find that there is a gritty and true story to ""8 Mile.""  Even though Eminem's character has so many tough breaks, you learn that it is with a strong supporting group of friends and believing in yourself that you can become successful at anything you put your heart into.Highly recommended, though there is a heavy amount of coarse language(as stated before, it fits this film).  Also, keep the youngsters away from this film.  It's R-rated for a good reason.  For those concerned, keep in mind that this movie is full of verbal and physical abuse and some very tense moments.

603276,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,B00005JLQE,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[3, 4]","Imagine you've been ditched by your girlfriend (she's told you she's pregnant), you've lost your job, your mum's banging one of your old schoolmates and your car won't start - just some of the many trials borne by James Smith Jr. aka Jimmy Rabbit. 8 Mile marks Eminem's acting debut in this Curtis Hanson directed movie. Also responsible for LA Confidential and Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Hanson certainly knows how to hone an emotional edge to his films. Set in Detroit, the film charts the frustrations of Jimmy Rabbit, Rabbit because he's fast and likes to f**k a lot. It's a fairly generic tale of gangland goings-on where the dream of fame and breaking out of the ghetto keeps hope alive (vis-a-vis Saturday Night Fever, Quadrophenia or even Rocky). The quirk in this tale is that B Rabbit is a white rapper in a black man's world and has to compete and respond to the racial diss that this entails.The film opens at a  'rap battle' at the The Shelter club where compere and friend Future (played by Mekhi Pfifer in an excellent support role) builds up 'Bunny Rabbit' to compete with L'il Tic, rival rapper of the Free World rap gang. Supported by Future and his 'brothers' from the 3-1-3 gang, Rabbit prepares for battle by heaving his guts out, locked in washrooms that you would rather not see than visit. After 'choking' with stage fright, Rabbit gets booed off the stage with contempt by the crowd of blacks and 'spics. The film then follows the following week until the mother of all rap battles takes place against the champion 'Papa-Doc' of Free World. Along the way, tramp-love interest Alex (played by sexy Brittany Murphy), the brothers and Kim Bassinger as Rabbit's trailer park mama all put in fine performances played against the backdrop of a bleak, run-down Detroit and the New Detroit Stamping Foundry. The film gets its name after the 8 mile Road, so named because it is 8 miles out from the town centre and marks the boundary between the run-down ghettos of downtown and more upmarket suburbs populated by white trailer trash and the more salubrious areas and casinos.The plot is hardly complicated or involved, but what makes the film for me is its credibility and insight into an area of life where none of us likely want to or are able to go. There's plenty of sideline activity away from Eminem, whether it's the beautifully timed, plain dumb antics of 'spic Cheddar Bob, the home spun philosophy of DJ Iz or the wide-eyed innocence of Rabbit's little sister Lilly (played by the 3 year old Chloe Greenfield). There's no time to get bored and one can only marvel at the mental and linguistic agility of the rappers, many of whom are genuine. The story also parallels the life of Eminem who rapped, as the story goes, from the age of 4 and entered the Rap Olympics in Los Angeles in 1997 desperate to win the $1500 prize (he came 2nd!). What of Eminem? Well, aside from his obvious virtuosity as a rapper, this 'dawg' is one natural actor with a stage presence and smouldering intensity that is impossible to ignore - somewhat reminiscent of Russell Crowe, whose big break also came in a Kim Bassinger film directed by Hanson. I wouldn't be surprised if we see him in a few years again at the Academy Awards picking up another Oscar, this time for acting. The film is beautifully crafted and builds up to a worthy finale.For those concerned about the language - yep, there's every manner of sexual innuendo but I didn't find it offensive in this context - I just had to remember to moderate the jive when taking a trip to the local 7/11. There's a modicum of violence, but much less so than in many blockbusters of today, and the sex scenes managed to convey the message without being needlessly voyeuristic or explicit.",3,It's not as crappy as I thought I would be,1103846400,"12 24, 2004",2004,3748,"['Imagine', ""'ve"", 'been', 'ditched', 'girlfriend', 'told', 'pregnant', ""'ve"", 'lost', 'job', 'mum', 'banging', 'one', 'old', 'schoolmates', 'car', 'wo', ""n't"", 'start', 'just', 'many', 'trials', 'borne', 'James', 'Smith', 'Jr.', 'Jimmy', 'Rabbit', '8', 'Mile', 'marks', 'Eminem', 'acting', 'debut', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'directed', 'movie', 'Also', 'responsible', 'LA', 'Confidential', 'Hand', 'Cradle', 'Hanson', 'certainly', 'how', 'hone', 'emotional', 'edge', 'films', 'Set', 'Detroit', 'film', 'frustrations', 'Jimmy', 'Rabbit', 'Rabbit', 'fast', 'likes', 'f**k', 'lot', 'fairly', 'generic', 'tale', 'gangland', 'goings-on', 'where', 'dream', 'fame', 'breaking', 'ghetto', 'keeps', 'hope', 'alive', 'vis-a-vis', 'Saturday', 'Night', 'Fever', 'Quadrophenia', 'even', 'Rocky', 'quirk', 'tale', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'white', 'rapper', 'black', 'man', 'world', 'compete', 'respond', 'racial', 'diss', 'entails.The', 'film', ""'rap"", 'battle', 'Shelter', 'club', 'where', 'compere', 'friend', 'Future', 'played', 'Mekhi', 'Pfifer', 'excellent', 'support', 'role', 'up', ""'Bunny"", 'Rabbit', 'compete', ""L'il"", 'Tic', 'rival', 'rapper', 'Free', 'World', 'rap', 'gang', 'Supported', 'Future', ""'brothers"", '3-1-3', 'gang', 'Rabbit', 'battle', 'heaving', 'guts', 'out', 'locked', 'washrooms', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'see', 'visit', ""'choking"", 'stage', 'fright', 'Rabbit', 'booed', 'off', 'stage', 'contempt', 'crowd', 'blacks', ""'spics"", 'film', 'then', 'following', 'week', 'mother', 'rap', 'battles', 'place', 'champion', ""'"", 'Free', 'World', 'way', 'tramp-love', 'interest', 'Alex', 'played', 'sexy', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'brothers', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'Rabbit', 'trailer', 'park', 'mama', 'put', 'fine', 'performances', 'played', 'backdrop', 'bleak', 'run-down', 'Detroit', 'New', 'Detroit', 'Stamping', 'Foundry', 'film', 'name', '8', 'mile', 'Road', 'so', 'named', '8', 'miles', 'out', 'town', 'centre', 'boundary', 'run-down', 'ghettos', 'downtown', 'more', 'upmarket', 'suburbs', 'populated', 'white', 'trailer', 'trash', 'more', 'salubrious', 'areas', 'casinos.The', 'plot', 'hardly', 'complicated', 'involved', 'film', 'credibility', 'insight', 'area', 'life', 'where', 'none', 'likely', 'want', 'are', 'able', 'go', 'plenty', 'sideline', 'activity', 'away', 'Eminem', 'beautifully', 'timed', 'plain', 'dumb', 'antics', ""'spic"", 'Cheddar', 'Bob', 'home', 'spun', 'philosophy', 'DJ', 'Iz', 'wide-eyed', 'innocence', 'Rabbit', 'little', 'sister', 'Lilly', 'played', '3', 'year', 'old', 'Chloe', 'Greenfield', 'time', 'get', 'bored', 'one', 'can', 'only', 'marvel', 'mental', 'linguistic', 'agility', 'rappers', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'genuine', 'story', 'also', 'life', 'Eminem', 'who', 'rapped', 'story', 'age', '4', 'entered', 'Rap', 'Olympics', 'Los', 'Angeles', '1997', 'desperate', 'win', '1500', 'prize', 'came', '2nd', 'What', 'Eminem', 'Well', 'aside', 'obvious', 'virtuosity', 'rapper', ""'dawg"", 'one', 'natural', 'actor', 'stage', 'presence', 'smouldering', 'intensity', 'impossible', 'ignore', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'big', 'break', 'also', 'came', 'Kim', 'Bassinger', 'film', 'directed', 'Hanson', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'see', 'few', 'years', 'again', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'picking', 'up', 'Oscar', 'time', 'acting', 'film', 'beautifully', 'crafted', 'up', 'worthy', 'finale.For', 'concerned', 'language', 'yep', 'manner', 'sexual', 'innuendo', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'offensive', 'context', 'just', 'had', 'remember', 'moderate', 'jive', 'when', 'taking', 'trip', 'local', '7/11', 'modicum', 'violence', 'much', 'less', 'so', 'many', 'blockbusters', 'today', 'sex', 'scenes', 'managed', 'convey', 'message', 'being', 'needlessly', 'voyeuristic', 'explicit']",8 Mile

I don't mean it is a good debut for a rapper-turned-actor, or it is a good movie for it's genre, I mean it is a good movie.  I'm not surprised either. I've heard all kinds of word of mouth on this film, but the bottom line is that if Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential, Wonder Boys)decided to make the film he must have seen something.  Whether it was in Emeinem as an actor, or the story, whatever, it works.Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks in Detroit.  He goes by the stage name Rabbit when he is trying to rap, but he has terrible stage fright.  Additionally his girlfriend dumps him and he is forced to move back into his mother's trailer.  Sounds sunny doesn't it?  His motivation is clear though.  He doesn't want to be just another loser from the 313 (the area he grew up in).  His way out is music, that's it.  This isn't Hollywood.The film is ""losely"" based on Eminem's real life.  From listening to his CD's I can pick some of these elements out, and this is important.  Eminem is good in the film.  He has screen presence, but he did not find some glossy action flick (as say DMX did), or some cheesy fluff (as say Britany Spears did), to make his feature debut.  No, he stayed true to his roots, a smart decision.  Eminem is an angry young man.  Wanna know why?  See 8 Mile.  It may not be entirely a true story, but the point is there.  This is how Eminem, the character, was created.  His real name, like Jimmy Smith, is Marshall Mathers. There is a difference.  Is he shocking? Is he vulgar? Is he violent?

I am so unacquainted with the star, &quot;Eminem&quot; that I've just learned he doesn't spell his name &quot;M&amp;M&quot;.  But because this film has gotten so much attention, I  thought it would be good for me to check out what for me is a culture stranger than that depicted in the foreign films that I watch all the time.The story is supposedly a fictionalized version of Eminem's own roots.  It's set in Detroit, where &quot;8 Mile&quot; is the area that separates the black and white neighborhoods.  The character Eminem plays is named &quot;Rabbit&quot; and he grows up in a trailer park with his mother, played by Kim Bassinger, who is excellent in the role.  His little sister is exposed to his mother's numerous boyfriends and it is with this little girl that Rabbit shows the most tenderness.  Rabbit works in a car plant but his whole life is about rap music and he hangs out with a group of both African American and white friends who feel the same way.There are scenes in the film which show what rap is all about.  It's not about the big money and the trashy lyrics.  Instead, it's about disadvantaged people who communicate the frustrations of their lives.  Much of it is spontaneous.  And much of it is competitive, where insults fly and there's always a battle to see who will win over the audience.  And an audience can be bystanders by a lunch wagon as well as in a club.I liked the part that Eminem played.  He comes across as real.  He wears a wool cap through much of the film, making his skin look very pale and his light eyes defiant. He shows vulnerability as well as strength and I rooted for him throughout.  This was not surprising because the film has a good script and is well paced with plenty of confrontations and tension.  What surprised me is how much I enjoyed the rap music.  It's all about words and being creative.  And doing it to a rhythm.  At first it was a little hard to understand.  But by the end of the film I was completely won over to rap as an art form.I loved &quot;8 Mile&quot; and highly recommend it.",5,Now I understand what rap music is all about.

It's nice to have the choice for those of us who prefer not to have the black bars present everytime we watch a DVD.Now on to the movie itself. I WAS REALLY SHOCKED! When I saw previews for this movie, it made me curious, and also a bit uninterested at the same time. The previews didn't say ANYTHING about the plot or what the movie was about, basically all they said about the film was ""hey Eminem made a movie! Go watch it because he's in it!"". I hate hype like that. So I was worried this movie would be another stupid mainstream, hyped up movie that would ultimatley [be unacceptable]. But I was wrong!The movie is roughly based around Eminem's own life; how he was poor, living in a trailor with a bad mother, and basically had a really bad life. The birght spot in his life? - Hip-hop. The character goes through a lot of drama with friends, and has to overcome both the oppression of others and his own hang ups in order to make it. Basically it's a movie about battle rapping and the hip-hop culture on the streets of detroit and how it impacted his life.Many people wont understand the plot because they dont understand hip-hop and can't relate. But this is a pretty original story-line. It's almost like a sports movie... sort of like remember the titans only instead of football the sport is battle rap. For those who don't understand battle rap it may not make any sense or seem stupid. If you're a true fan of hip-hop you'll love this movie.The battles are well-crafted and hilarious. I dont know who actually wrote all the rhymes but they are lyrically very nice. The acting too, is off the hook. Eminem does a really good job playin his character, and all the characters are likeable. All around this movie is well done and was a really nice surprise for me. The message of overcoming obsticales and finding your own niche in life is well woven into the story. If you hate eminem (and I know lots of parents or rap-haters do) you may come to respect him after watching the movie. I like to think little marshal has more in common with B Rabbit than he does his alter ego ""slim shady"".Check it out before ya buy, and if it aint your thing, then you aint gonna like it (people who just watch MTV videos and have no REAL understanding of what hip hop really is), but I loved it, and I think many others are surprised that this movie was as good as it was.",5,A Surprisingly good movie!,1052179200,"05 6, 2003",2003,2499,"['First', 'Id', 'say', 'how', 'nice', 'see', 'major', 'DVD', 'release', 'offered', 'FULL', 'SCREEN', 'format', 'as', 'well', 'widescreen', 'nice', 'have', 'choice', 'who', 'prefer', 'not', 'have', 'black', 'bars', 'present', 'everytime', 'watch', 'DVD.Now', 'movie', 'WAS', 'REALLY', 'SHOCKED', 'When', 'saw', 'previews', 'movie', 'made', 'curious', 'also', 'bit', 'uninterested', 'same', 'time', 'previews', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'ANYTHING', 'plot', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'about', 'basically', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'hey', 'Eminem', 'made', 'movie', 'Go', 'watch', 'hate', 'hype', 'So', 'was', 'worried', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'stupid', 'mainstream', 'hyped', 'up', 'movie', 'would', 'ultimatley', '[', 'be', 'unacceptable', ']', 'was', 'wrong', 'movie', 'roughly', 'based', 'Eminem', 'own', 'life', 'how', 'was', 'poor', 'living', 'trailor', 'bad', 'mother', 'basically', 'had', 'really', 'bad', 'life', 'birght', 'spot', 'life', 'Hip-hop', 'character', 'lot', 'drama', 'friends', 'overcome', 'oppression', 'others', 'own', 'hang', 'ups', 'order', 'make', 'Basically', 'movie', 'battle', 'rapping', 'hip-hop', 'culture', 'streets', 'detroit', 'how', 'impacted', 'life.Many', 'people', 'wont', 'understand', 'plot', 'dont', 'understand', 'hip-hop', 'ca', ""n't"", 'relate', 'pretty', 'original', 'story-line', 'almost', 'sports', 'movie', 'sort', 'remember', 'titans', 'only', 'instead', 'football', 'sport', 'battle', 'rap', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'battle', 'rap', 'may', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'seem', 'stupid', ""'re"", 'true', 'fan', 'hip-hop', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie.The', 'battles', 'are', 'well-crafted', 'hilarious', 'dont', 'know', 'who', 'actually', 'wrote', 'rhymes', 'are', 'lyrically', 'very', 'nice', 'acting', 'too', 'hook', 'Eminem', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'playin', 'character', 'characters', 'are', 'likeable', 'movie', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'surprise', 'message', 'overcoming', 'obsticales', 'finding', 'own', 'niche', 'life', 'well', 'woven', 'story', 'hate', 'eminem', 'know', 'lots', 'parents', 'rap-haters', 'do', 'may', 'come', 'respect', 'watching', 'movie', 'like', 'think', 'little', 'marshal', 'more', 'common', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'alter', 'ego', 'slim', 'shady', '.Check', 'out', 'ya', 'buy', 'thing', 'then', 'aint', 'gon', 'people', 'who', 'just', 'watch', 'MTV', 'videos', 'have', 'REAL', 'understanding', 'what', 'hip', 'hop', 'really', 'loved', 'think', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'was']",8 Mile

I think he is very clever, to be able to think up rhymes like that on the spot.It was all in the script, of course, but if this film is really semi-autobiographical, he would have been doing that kind of rap battle before he got famous - making up rhymes on the spot. Even if they are rather offensive to the opponent, some of them are still really witty.And by the way, a lot of people I know who have seen the film say the sex scene is really explicit - but it's not that bad actually.

603291,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLQE,Matthew Horner,"[4, 7]","I don't know quite what to make of ""8 Mile"". I am admittedly not much of a fan of rap music or of the movie's star, Eminem. This is not to say I haven't enjoyed some rap songs, some of which were written and performed by Marshall Mathers, AKA Eminem.The movie was directed by one of my favorite directors, Curtis Hanson. To me, it does not stand up to his best works, ""LA Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"". Is this because those are stronger films or because the subject matter in ""8 Mile"" is less appealing to me? I'm not sure, but I do know this: ""8 Mile"" is relentlessly dark [literally and figuratively] and grim, whereas Hanson's previous efforts, though serious, were peppered with a great deal of satire and humor. What is ironic to me is that the director fails to see the satiric, humorous nature of much of rap music itself.Jimmy [Eminem] grew up on the `wrong side' of Detroit's 8 Mile Road, which is a kind of boundary between the city's mostly black inner city and its predominately white suburbs. Jimmy is an angry young man who channels his frustrations into his rap music. The problem is that he's a `trailer trash white boy' [his own description of himself] trying to make it in a rap world dominated by black artists. Adding to his woes is the fact that, after packing all his things into a garbage bag and leaving his pregnant girlfriend, he is forced to live with his drunken mother [Kim Basinger] and her...boyfriend. The few bright spots in his life are his kid sister, his small group of loyal friends and his musical talent. Can Jimmy escape his fate through his music, or will he end up being just another [also-ran] in the long history of pop music?Eminem is excellent as Jimmy, but whether this is because he is a fine actor or because he is playing a version of himself remains to be seen. There are certainly many parallels between his life and character he plays.As a movie about pop music culture, this one is superior to most others.

Then after seeing the movie, I knew it was definitely not. Maybe somewhat but definitely not what I thought it was going to be. Honestly I don't know much about his life other than he hates his ex Kim and he is ticked at his Mom.8 Mile is a pretty good movie though on its own. The dreams of a white man making it in what most consider a black mans game. Sure, some have and were basically one hit wonders like Vanilla Ice and maybe even Snow (was he white?). Some were amazing like the Beastie Boys and even Eminem himself. Sure we never really see the rapping part take off like inHustle and Flow [Blu-ray], but we do see him 'battle' which is two guys facing off and free styling, which I consider harder than rapping since you basically coming up with rhymes on the spot.Eminem plays Rabbit/Jimmy and is a kid basically living out of a garbage bag. With a dead end job for his future, the only thing Rabbit dreams for is a better future for himself and for his sister who lives with her bad/decent mom. And the only thing he has going for him is rap... and he's really good at it. He mainly just wants to record his music, but having no money, he can't really get studio time without help. So to pass the time he goes to a place where people battle to earn respect and recognition. And really that's basically the gist of the movie.Eminem actually plays a good role, even it probably wasn't to tough to basically play himself. Kim Basinger plays his mom and does a really god job. One minute you like her and the next minute you want to scream at her saying 'WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?'. Brittany Murphy is also in here and really didn't need to be.  I hated her role. She just seemed like some drugged out hooker to me the whole time.Though I liked the movie, I also don't really care for it... but... then I did like it also. Weird I know. Right when I would start getting bored with parts or rolling my eyes at parts, they would make me laugh or just get really interested again. For instance...one scene has Rabbit and his friend working on his car and the friend is trying to get him to come battle next week. We get it already...Rabbit is good and needs to battle. And then you hear 'Sweet Home Alabama' playing from inside the trailer and Rabbit and his friend start free styling to it and it really sounded good...which made me get interested again. I don't know...kinda hard to explain I guess.In the end I would say rent it if anything. The last 3 battles were really good on Em's part.P.S.

603294,A10Y596I3SL84S,B00005JLQE,"M Darrow ""therekloose""","[0, 1]","What I feared the most about this flick and what was in fact the main reason (along with not wanting to be trapped in a theater full of teen hoodlums) I didn't see the film in theatre despite my respect for the director is related to the soundtrack.  Being someone who hasn't listened to hip-hop consistently for four years, I didn't want to hear a bunch of songs by eminem and xzibit and 50 cent (whoever the hell that is) as the backdrop for a film.  But, to my surprise, right at the outset, we're greeted with mobb deep's shook ones and we pretty much never look back (or forward as it were) except for Lose Yourself at the credits and  a little chopped into one scene.  What you will hear is more mobb deep, biggie, tupac, naughty by nature and an abundance of wu tang as the score for the lives of the hip hop obsessed characters.  Though, this is what I would have expected had I known that the story took place in '95 as director Hansen is a master of time and place.  The free styling heard throughout is also a delight.  Without the handicap that the real eminem suffers from (namely derivative west coast production) BRabbit spills some of the more memorable battle rhymes you're likely to hear.If you don't have some love for rap (past or present) you really should just stay away from this film because there's probably no way that it can please you.  Because outside of the music itself, everything in the film (good and bad) reflects the good and ill of hip hop.  There's a great sense of place (much like you'll find in rap) but it's very exclusionary to any virtue that is not urban.  Also, all of the hatred that the hip hop culture has for women is poured into the two female characters.  All of the scenes of male camaraderie, be it rousting about an open car hood or charging into battle with another click, rings true and reflects a certain joy and zeal.  But whenever there's a female onscreen (unless its in the person of a decidedly androgynous rappess), there lingers a foul stench of hatred and the story loses all verisimilitude.  The women - the mother and girlfriend (for lack of a better term - I'm referring to the sexy-vapid plot device in a short (frequently lifted) skirt played by brittany murphy) are self serving and manipulative and all too obsessed with either (as the mother) having a man or (in the case of the girl) using one for self gain.  It's really a shame that after all these years hip hop is still bubbling to an overflow with misogyny.  Even if they wanted to make the female characters loathsome, nothing excuse the loss-point driving action of Murphy's character felandering with one of b rabbits friends in a location where they knew he was due to show up at any second.

But his acting is great and the fact that he wrote most of the soundtrack shows that he's one of a kind.I did enjoy this film; I liked it better on my second watching. Although the insults and rapping was good during the rap battles, you could see the rappers literally spitting the words if the camera went in too close. Also, the handshake between Jimmy Rabbit (Eminem) and his friends gradually got on my nerves. The worst part of the film is when Jimmy gets beaten up, and Lily is screaming in the trailer. I cannot watch that part; it's so horrible. I was constantly turning the sound up and down during this, particularly when Rabbit and his mates are out driving in the car, you can hardly hear their lines as whatever they're playing is far too loud. Also, when they're in the Shelter, and the crowd is so noisy! And then I couldn't hear what Brittany Murphy was saying, so the volume was turned back up, and then I had to quickly turn it down in the next scene!Well known for her roles in Girl Interrupted, Cherry Falls, and Drop Dead Gorgeous, this will be THE film of Brittany Murphy's career. Although she normally always has dark hair, in 8 Mile and Just Married, she attempts going blonde and it really suits her. There's chemistry between Brittany Murphy & Eminem and she definitely acts like she's enjoying herself during their sex scene! Lucky Brittany!Kim Basinger plays Jimmy's mum, downtrodden and without makeup, embarrassing her son with her sex life.Eminem's various and prominent tattoos are notably absent during this film, most importantly during the topless shot - the makeup artists must have had fun trying to cover up those!During 8 Mile you can also see and hear the progress on the song that is the theme to the film - ""Lose Yourself"", which is perfect for this film.The finale is the highlight of the film, worth watching just for that - and Eminem looking sexy in a vest top!The DVD contains: the making of; exclusive rap battles; the music of;  ""Superman"" music video; theatrical trailer; production notes; cast & filmmakers; recommendations and DVD-ROM features. Definitely better value than some DVDs you can get these days, which don't have much more than the trailer - if that - on them! The ""Exclusive Rap Battles"" is narrated by Curtis Hanson (director), and also features Eminem talking about his first time doing a rap battle. The whole sequence wouldn't be what it is without the extras; they are definitely part of it. Curtis Hanson gave four of the extras a once in a lifetime opportunity to battle against Eminem. During this, Eminem was actually losing his voice, so he mimes his words, but some of the winners start really ribbing him during their rapping, so understandably, he raps back, making this the best out of the DVD extras. It's a very brave girl who goes up to battle against Eminem, who totally ribs her during his rapping, but he hugs her afterwards.My other favourite about the DVD extras is the video to ""Superman"", the song which made me go out and get ""The Eminem Show"" album. It's one of the best songs that Eminem has done, for me, and seeing the video sheds new light on the song. The only thing I didn't like about the video was the female starring alongside him - when you see close up shots she looks a LOT older than she looks from further away. The lyrics, like most of Eminem's songs, are fantastic, and I'm constantly humming it. All the video is brilliantly shot especially the shots of Eminem with 50+ women in their underwear - you can barely see him most of the time!8 Mile is a must see for all Eminem fans and recommended even for non-Eminem fans. It shows Eminem in a different light, to that of his hard man, woman hating rapper persona.

603298,A1XIOOXV9LAZXZ,B00005JLQE,"Melissa Ann Minners ""wildkarrde3""","[0, 1]","I've always enjoyed listening to Eminem's music, but I never believed that I would enjoy watching Eminem follow other rappers footsteps and try his thing on the big screen.  However, I was intrigued by the trailers for 8 Mile.  Yes, the movie's plot is highly familiar: A kid, down on his luck, tries his best to make a life for himself.  He uses his talent for rap to try and make it out of the trailer park home that he lives in with his deadbeat mom and her drunk boyfriend.  Along the way, he is met by many obstacles, but he persists and makes it.  We've all seen these movies before.  What grabbed me in the trailers was the fact that you could see Eminem's acting ability just in those couple of scenes chosen to wow the audience.  I vowed to see this movie when it hit the theaters, and two days after its release, that's exactly what I did!And I was definitely not disappointed!  Marshall Matthers (Eminem) plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., known to his friends as Rabbit, and known to the local rappers as B-Rabbit.  All Jimmy wants to do is make it big doing what he loves most - rapping.  Even on his way to work at a Detroit factory, he works on lyrics for his songs, praying that one day he'll create that killer demo tape that will launch him into stardom and out of his mom's trailer park home.  Eminem plays this role with such intensity, you almost forget that this is a rap star and not a seasoned actor.  Mekhi Phifer convincingly portrays Future, a friend of Jimmy's who also is the MC of the local rap battles.  He believes in B-Rabbit even though his last turn on the stage was tragically disappointing.  Kim Bassinger is great as Jimmy's screwed up mother and Brittany Murphy shines once again as Jimmy's girlfriend.The storyline may be old, but it is so skillfuly done, that by the end of the movie, you find yourself rooting for B-Rabbit.  Not only did I enjoy watching the down-and-out-punk-makes-good story, but the soundtrack is awesome.  And the rap battles!  They didn't look rehearsed at all - looked totally improvisational!

603299,A1TJPMB7N776WS,B00005JLQE,MICHAEL ACUNA,"[5, 8]","Eminem's performance as Jimmy/Rabbit in ""8 Mile"" is as auspicious and as natural and un-mannered as Diana Ross's debut in ""Lady Sings the Blues."" The fact that both are singers, though their music is miles apart in style, should not be a surprise to anyone though, as it takes just as much emotional awareness and guts to sell a song, as it is to give a fully realized performance on the screen. Whether or not Eminem can or wants to sustain a career as an actor remains, at this point a mystery.The plot of ""8 Mile"" is very straightforward: a quick-tempered young man from the bad side of the tracks (Rabbit) has a talent not only for rapping but also for getting into trouble. He longs to make a career of his musical talent but chokes when he is asked to perform in front of an audience. Rabbit's mother (Kim Bassinger) is not available emotionally to him as she has her own problems: dealing with alcohol dependence and relationship problems.At the outset, I thought this film was going to go the ""rags to riches"" route with Rabbit finding success and money only to lose the love of those closest to him as in ""A Star is Born"" or ""Funny Girl."" But the director, Curtis Hanson is too smart a cookie and too intelligent a filmmaker for that. Instead, Rabbit has a small revelation, a small turnaround, and a small success in his musical career that amounts to a less than expected catharsis on our part but a more realistic one on Rabbit's. As such, Hanson is looking for the truths in Rabbit's life not the fantasies in ours. And, more to the point...it works.The best scenes in ""8 Mile"" are the sweaty, intense rap duels set in a dark, dank nightclub. I am not a fan of rap yet I felt the heat, the fervor, and the commitment of the rappers up front and in my face. Hanson sets these scenes in such a way so as to jam the rappers and their raps down our collective throats. If nothing else, this film will serve to educate/wake people up to the emotional connection and dedication that so many young people (of all races) feel for rap. There is a transcendent and spellbinding truth going on in rap that frankly I, along with many others, felt cut off from.

603301,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,B00005JLQE,Michael Crane,"[1, 1]","Jimmy Smith Jr. is practicing his lines and verses in a dirty and dark bathroom before he is to hit the stage and partake in a battle, (rap-diss competition).  He looks into the mirror as he practices and practices.  He seems confident and ready, until he runs to the toilet and regurgitates.  As much as he wants to do this, he's still scared out of his mind.  But soon, it is time for him to go onstage and compete.This is the story of Jimmy ""Rabbit,"" Smith, and his struggles and life in 8 Mile.  He has dreams of becoming a rapper, but he knows that until he is able to act out on it, that's all it is; a dream.  Him and his buddies talk about how they're going to be rich and famous, but Rabbit appears to be the only one with potential and determination.  The others, well, just like to talk, and it seems like that's all they'll ever do.  A very important figure is Future, Rabbit's friend, and the host of the ""battles.""  He sort of looks over him like a father figure, always encouraging him and telling him that he can be something if he puts his mind to it.Things are going badly for Rabbit, however.  He broke up with his girlfriend, which means moving back with his mother and little sister in a trailer home, along with his mother's boyfriend who can't stand Rabbit, (the feeling is very mutual).  His mother doesn't appear to have much confidence in how Rabbit is living his life, thinking that he'll never amount to anything.  He works at a job in where his boss is looking for any excuse to fire him.  And as the days go on, he seems to be having more and more doubts about how things are going to turn out in the end for him.  However, there is still something inside of him that will not let him give up, no matter what.""8 Mile"" is a sad, and yet triumphant film about how far someone will go to make their dreams come true, no matter what obstacles are thrown in the way.  Rabbit very much wants to be a rapper, and to also get out of 8 Mile, where he knows he will never fully succeed until he gets out of there.  It's a very well done movie, at that.  Curtis Hanson does a terrific job of directing, and I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that he was qualified for the job.  I don't think it would've been as good if it were done by anyone else.  This isn't a dreamy or fantasy movie; it's real life.  The struggles and achievements are real and not artificial.Eminem brings great charisma onto the screen.  All the critics are saying how good of an actor he really is.  Although I thought he was awesome, I don't he had to do that much acting.  He just had to be himself and get back into the mind frame of a struggling kid with dreams.  However, that does not mean it's an easy task.  Eminem proved that he could do a great job on screen.The other actors are also really great in the movie.  Kim Basinger turns out to be quite believable as Rabbit's troubled and alcoholic mother.  Brittany Murphy does a terrific job of playing Alex, Rabbit's somewhat new love interest.  (Trust me, ""somewhat"" is the right word.)  Mekhi Phifer is also outstanding as Future, and proves to be a great friend to Rabbit, through the good times and the bad.A lot of people have said that the movie is not really based on Eminem's life, but more inspired by it.  I can see that, because seeing the movie really gives you more of an idea of what Eminem had to go through to get to where he is right now.  He isn't some white kid pretending to be from the hood; this is really where he grew up.  He's walked the walk and talked the talk.  He is the real deal.  There are things you can see where the inspiration came from; like the relationship between Rabbit and his sister is much like the one between Eminem and his daughter.  Of course, there are differences, like the fact that the relationship between Rabbit and his mother, while troubling and painful, seems to have more hope than the real one between Eminem and his mother at this current time.  (I can't really blame him, though.  Sounds like she's been terrible to him.)  Though this movie may be fiction, you can really see the truth in it all.""8 Mile"" was a terrific film that I really enjoyed.  Do you have to be an Eminem fan to enjoy it?  Not necessarily, although it might help a little.  It is possible to still like the movie and not like Eminem.  It's a story about hardships, obstacles, struggles, and goals.  If you only had one opportunity to make it big and change your life, would you take it, or just let it pass you by?  That's what the film ""8 Mile"" asks us.  It's not about stardom and it's not a rags-to-riches story.  It's a story that helps us realize that some things are possible, but it's up to us to make sure they happen.",4,"Dark, Sad, Triumphant, and Honest.

The roads are numbered, and 8 mile is the bad area where the prostitutes are. I know this, because Maleficent lived near (but not in 8 mile, heavens no!) there.Apparently, there's a whole rap culture going on. Eminem, playing a guy named Rabbit, finally starts to realize that the world he lives in sucks. Actually, he's always known that, but he was embarassed about it. The movie is about him coming to terms with who he is and where he comes from.And that's about it. For the most part, 8 Mile is a very clean movie. It has all the same plot of a Rocky movie -- poor guy competes against big winner against all odds. Big bad winner has an outside-of-the-competition conflict with underdgo/protagonist. There's a girl from whom the protagonist draws his strength. And he has friends who are faithful to him to the end.There's some important differences. In this movie, the girl is actually a [...] sleeping her way to the top. But the movie recognizes that her way is just as valid as anyone else's to get out of the hell hole they live in.Additionally, the whole final contest -- a freestyle showdown involving rap -- is basically meaningless. Winning isn't about the admiration of people who could give a crap if Rabbit lives or dies. It's about him finally putting his demons to rest by admitting he's white trash. Rabbit draws upon the raw ugliness of his background to pull himself up by his bootstraps -- not his girlfriend, not his family, and not his friends.And for that, you can respect Rabbit. At the end of the movie, he doesn't go on to become a rapping champion or getting that sweet record deal. He goes back to work.Formulaic? Yes. Is Eminem a great actor? Hardly. But the movie doesn't try to be more than it is, and for that it earns my respect.The only thing that seriously mars it is Eminem's ""I'm friends to all the gays"" rap. His gay pal covers for him at work and Rabbit defends him with his rap.If you've forgotten, Eminem was seriously slammed for his homophobic lyrics. Eminiem seems to be trying to say that's part of his language. In other words, it's not that HE'S homophobic, it's just part of his speech. Which is complete and utter crap. Reality is, the culture he comes from is homophobic, and that's just the way it is. Ironically, in trying to pretend he recognizes his roots, Eminem rejected the ugly parts.Please -- those moments in the film reminded me that this is a movie whose sole purpose is to perpetuate the myth and legend of Eminem.

603308,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00005JLQE,mirasreviews,"[5, 6]","Rapper Eminem portrays Detroit factory worker and street rapper ""B. Rabbit"" in this poor-boy-makes-good story based loosely on Eminem's own life. Rabbit desperately wants to make a demo tape of his music and rap his way out of the trailer park and into a better life. He must cope with his venomous alcoholic mother, manipulative friends, neighborhood thugs, and overcome his own intense stage fright in order to get respect for his work and a shot at exposure. Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's most loyal and sensible friend who pushes him to do better and has unfailing confidence in Rabbit's ability to succeed. Brittany Murphy is Rabbit's unfaithful but supportive love interest Alex. And Kim Basinger plays Rabbit's dysfunctional mother, with whom he shares a love-hate relationship.The verdict is still out on whether Eminem can act. Eminem is certainly convincing in his role, but I am under the impression that B. Rabbit is too close to the rapper's own experience to be an accurate judge of acting talent. Eminem's rapping talent and charisma are not in question. Even the uninitiated will be convinced that he has plenty of both, and tremendous screen presence as well. Fans of Curtis Hanson may be surprised that the director has made such a conventional  film. That's a little surprising coming from Eminem too. But the fact is that 8 Mile is a smart public relations move on Eminem's part. This is mainstream fair, complete with a mainstream crossover soundtrack. It's good mainstream fair, as is the soundtrack. And B. Rabbit is sweet enough and politically correct enough in his attitudes towards women, homosexuals and his loser friends to assuage middle-class audiences into thinking Eminem is a decent guy. I'm not saying that he isn't. I'm only saying that 8 Mile is less a convincing portrait of inner city poverty and salvation in music as it is a trailer park fairy tale, constructed in a very cliched fashion, to promote -some would say whitewash- Eminem's image for a wider audience. -Which is fine. It's an entertaining film, and Eminem has great presence. But we haven't seen the frank, brilliant, hateful Eminem who is so loved and so loathed on the silver screen yet.

603310,A3IMNZSYDOTTU6,B00005JLQE,"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[3, 3]","Rapper Eminem is one of the biggest names in rap...period. He's sold over 40 million albums worldwide and has garnered Grammys and other awards over his near-decade career. With so much success, it was only a matter of time before a movie would become a reality, and 8 MILE makes a big case for Eminem's acting career. Boasting impressive settings, a really good cast, and gritty drama, this movie is fantastic from front to back.We follow the story of Jimmy Smith (aka B Rabbit) who can flow like any rapper can, but the trouble is he is wicked shy of the crowd at the ""shelter"" where the rap battles happen. His friends Chedda Bob, Future (Mekhi Pfeiffer, who makes a strong presence here), and his other cohorts are his friends. He lives in a trailer with his alcoholic mother (played by Kim Basinger, who is vulnerable here), and his little sister. Eminem works at the Detroit Stamping company, where the pay ain't great but the work is hard, and there is some prejudice. Jimmy doesn't exactly have the best life, but he's trying to do the best that he can. His mother's abusive boyfriend, Greg, isn't exactly helping matters either...he doesn't really like Jimmy and takes every opportunity to put him down. Eminem starts to really take his rapping future seriously, though, and when he meets a new girl (Brittany Murphy), things begin to change a bit. But pressures ride as Leaders of the Free World claim to have the best raps, and after an altercation with one of the members, Eminem gets the crap kicked out of him. But this only makes him stronger, and he intends to beat the LOTFW at the rap battles. His mother strikes it big at bingo and things really start looking better. The night of the battle, Eminem can't choke like he did the first time at the beginning of the movie, so now he's gotta show that he is the man when it comes to stepping up to the mic. His relationship with his boss at work gets much better too, so work is piling up. I don't want to give away what happens at the rap battle, but I'm sure you can guess what happens. Even the ending of the movie is really strong, with ""Lose Yourself"" playing in the background as Eminem walks off into the alley, having a newly restored confidence as he strolls back to work.The movie benefits greatly from Eminem's convincing performance. He's not just cashing the check here, he really can act. He mixes some good emotions and strong acting with impressive raps and this was bound to happen. He's good at what he does...and he's good here. The rest of the cast is good, too, with Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Pfeiffer and Kim Basinger all taking good turns honing their acting chops. Of course the rap bouts are the talk of the town, and you should find plenty to enjoy in these moments. But the quiet, anguished moments are just as strong, and the slum-like sets of Detroit ring loud and clear in this picture. All of it makes a big difference in the power and the lesson of the movie.So Eminem fans, fear not. Eminem does just fine in his big film debut here. You'll find a lot to appreciate here, with some laughs, some tear-y moments, and some gritty street drama. While many never thought Eminem could carry his own as an actor, 8 MILE presents a strong case for his possible future in this business.

There may not be an introduction in the movie stating 'based on a true story,' but for anyone remotely familiar with Eminem, the similarities between his life and the movie are obvious. B.

The movie is - of course - about his realization of these things, and what he does to change them. I enjoyed 8 Mile. It's no revolutionary step forward in urban drama, but it's a darn fine movie.

603313,A1RZ1KIP4LJYDZ,B00005JLQE,"moviefreak ""moviefreak2003""","[0, 4]","Controversial rapper Eminem stars in 8 Mile, a film that will leave viewers undissapointed despite its foul language, violence, and sex.  8 Mile is definetely not afraid to show the cold and violent streets of Detroit, where a crime is comitted every second.  Eminem stars as Jimmy Smiths Jr., otherwise known as Rabbit.  By day, Rabbit is a worker in a broken down factory.  By night, he is a rapper working at ""The Shelter"" a club where rappers face off for money.  He hardly wins because the audience always hates him and calls him a ""white rapper in black neighborhood""  After that, he returns to his trailer home (usually beaten up by the gangs that stalk the streets)where he has to deal with other problems, including his usually drunk mother (Kim Basinger) who continuously is dating people half her age.  After Rabbit gives up at a concert, his friend Future (Mekhi Phifer) encourages him to go on and signs him up for a face-off against a black rapper who currently holds the championship at the Shelter.  The movie displays a wide variety of events that happen from the the start of the week (Rabbit losing) and end of the week (Rabbit facing off against the other rapper).  Included in the mix is Brittany Murphy, who plays a prostitute and Eminem's love interest.Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential) did a fine job directing but I didn't feel like it was the right film for him to direct, partly it features so much rap and the ""F"" word is said about 175 times.  Brian Grazer (A Beautiful Mind) was a good producer and really made the movie much better though the writer added so much foul language.  Hanson and Grazer - Great combination.Though this is a film meant for adults, some kids should be let to see it because its a very hard-hitting drama and features their idol.

603314,A1YHKSTVSYEYTU,B00005JLQE,Mr. N. Carnegie,"[1, 1]","So here it is, the movie &#8216;debut&#8217; of Eminem, the man once referred to by President Bush as 'the most dangerous threat to American children since polio'. Directed by Curtis Hanson (previously responsible for the excellent LA Confidential), Marshall Mathers III stars as Jimmy &#8216;B. Rabbit&#8217; Smith, a wannabe rapper struggling to break of a life of poverty on the wrong side of Detroit&#8217;s 8 Mile Road.8 Mile opens with B. Rabbit about to go on stage to take part in an open mic rap contest at a rap venue called &#8216;The Shelter&#8217;. Plagued by nerves, he throws up in the bathroom and down his sweater before going on stage, where in front of a cynical and somewhat hostile back audience he completely dries up in an embarrassing case of stage fright. Homeless and car-less after splitting up with his &#8216;pregnant&#8217; girlfriend he has to return to his mother&#8217;s trailer home, whereupon he disturbs his mother (Kim Basinger) mid-coital with her younger lover Greg. As if that is not embarrassing enough his mother later confides to a horrified Rabbit that she is having problems with her sex life because Greg wont go down on her.Almost everything in 8 Mile suggests that this is less than fiction and whilst perhaps not quite autobiographical it is certainly quasi-autobiographical. Much like a pre-superstardom Eminem, his character Jimmy has an absentee father, he hangs around with a multiracial crew and takes part in rapping competitions. Jimmy&#8217;s mother is a drunken fool neglecting her four-year old daughter, whilst living with a no-good loser virtually the same age as her son, in a squalid trailer. Jimmy&#8217;s crew dream of becoming rap stars and see their rhyming skills as being their best hope of getting out of the inner city deprivation and urban wasteland of America&#8217;s famous motor city. However, whilst dreaming of a way out of the urban wasteland and poverty that surrounds him Rabbit still has to work a day job in a steel pressing plant where his boss gives him a hard time for his time-keeping and attitude.Eminem is not just the most famous rapper in America, he is quite simply the biggest star on the planet. In the superstardom stakes he is, if you will pardon the comparison, the new Michael Jackson (without the chimp, the plastic surgery, the dance moves and with a great deal more profanity). Of course 8 Mile isn't actually Eminem&#8217;s film debut; that was in The Wash, Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg's ill-conceived remake of the 70&#8217;s flick &#8216;Car Wash&#8217;, where he made a cameo appearance as a phone-stalker psycho. As The Wash proved, rap artists don&#8217;t necessarily make great actors or great films (remember Vanilla Ice in the cringeworthy Cold As Ice anyone?) and with the exception of Ice Cube and Tupac Shakur, very few have actually made the transition from music to movies as well as this.Perhaps not an obviously heroic figure Eminem's public persona has been somewhat modified in his role as Jimmy &#8216;Rabbit&#8217; Smith. Jimmy&#8217;s actions are anti-homophobic (he comes to the defence of one of his gay colleagues), he is positively passive (rather than verbally violent) to all the women in his life regardless of how much they wrong him. Indeed the movie opens with Rabbit having given his car and home away to his ex-girlfriend who claims to be pregnant and he returns to his mom&#8217;s trailer where he raps an improvised lullaby to his little sister. For much of the movie, Rabbit is a brooding somewhat introverted character. He travels to his work on the bus, headphones on, hooded and scribbling down new ideas for lyrics. However the movie and Eminem both come alive during the rap battles, which are central to the plot, where rival rappers verbally tear each other limb from limb in front of a hostile crowd. Taunting Rabbit with cries of &#8220;Elvis&#8221; and comments about his mother and their trailer park home, this is Eminem in his equivalent of Rocky&#8217;s boxing ring or General Maximus Decimus Meridus&#8217;s coliseum. Rabbit must overcome his own fears and self-doubt in order to emerge triumphant.Out-with this critics will say that Director Curtis Hanson (The Wonder Boys) has deliberately restricted Eminem to a range of acting, which does not require much flexing of thespian muscle. However, this is something of a moot point because it works. Eminem looks good. It is a credible and understated performance and 8 Mile is an entertaining and uplifting movie, which showcases his great talent. As always, Curtis Hanson&#8217;s direction is flawless and he has surrounded Slim Shady with an excellent supporting cast. In particular, Mekhi Phifer (ER) as Rabbit&#8217;s best buddy &#8216;Future&#8217;, Brittany Murphy (Don&#8217;t Say A Word) as would be trashy new girlfriend Alex, Evan Jones as the dopey Cheddar Bob and Kim Basinger are all excellent.Perhaps not the most original story ever told, 8 Mile has been compared to Rocky, Saturday Night Fever and A Star Is Born. However, it is refreshing to see that 8 Mile is free of a traditional Hollywood ending and instead finishes on a more realistic note with an important message; Dreams cannot be realised if all you do is dream. Hard work and perseverance are the keys to success and the only person you can totally rely upon in this life is yourself.",4,**** THE EMINEM SHOW ****,1050451200,"04 16, 2003",2003,5357,"['So',

Who of us cannot relate to that?The film has a lot of detractors.  Some of their reasoning is valid.  The scene where Jimmy Smith defends a gay man is too contrived.  Besides Eminem's well-chronicled views on homosexuality, it's also a bit unrealistic within the context of the movie.  The plot takes place in 1995.  I cannot think of a single emcee at that time who would have stood up to defend a homosexual man (I really can't think of one who would do that now).  Other gripes are unneccessary.  Many complain that Eminem is just playing himself.  First, Eminem is not an actor, so what's the big deal?  Secondly, is it really all that easy to play yourself in front of the camera?....Perhaps my favorite part of the DVD, though, is when we're being shown the four rappers who were chosen to film extra battle scenes with Eminem.  This scene shows us something about Eminem that has to be admired.  This was a fake battle scene being filmed for a movie and it might or might not make the final cut.  It wasn't like there would be any damage to his career, right?  In addition, Eminem was tired, was losing his voice and director Curtis Hanson asked him to rest his voice and just let the other emcees do their thing.  After the second rapper went though, Eminem simply could not allow things to stand pat.  For the last three contestants, he allowed them to do their thing, and then responded by showing why he really is one of the best battle emcees on the planet.  He shows his talent and his competetiveness.

Contrived yes, but it get worse when Rabbit's mom (Basinger) pops out of the blue with the line ""We are being evicted"" and with that the film is lost to stereotypical black men pulling guns, insulting people and picking fights.Very few will take this film seriously enough and although Eminem merits a nod for this performance (yes he can act) the script is like something that popped out of a twelve year old Eminem fan's computer printer, and feels like it too.

Like any other feel good movies, he's blessed with genuine friends who are selfless & supportive all along.  They know that he's a diamond ready to be cut but before that, he needs to be made known that he's TRULY something.  Eventually, he finds the truth & that he's courageous enough to take the next step into manhood, to be somebody.  I don't need to say more about Eminem's acting capability.  He's in his element & it's surprising to note his charisma on-screen.  It's difficult to get our eyes off him.  The supporting cast is amazing.  Brittany Murphy is convincing as a white trash girl who would ""sell"" her body to get somewhere; Mekhi Phiffer (the Negro doctor in ER)& Kim Basinger are all wonderful.  What made ""8 Mile"" even more compelling to watch is the slum neighbourhood in Detroit which the Director uses to his advantage.  Even though the story is predictable, it's still a wonderful movie to watch.  The rap scene is quite an eye-opener for someone who's new to the alternative culture aspect of United States.

I also like classical music and classic rock. Although he does use a lot of expletives, this is a case where the expletives are not a mask for inferior work -- his stuff is good. The movie does not have him swearing nearly as much as his music does. However, there are several sexual situations that should stay out of the reach of youngsters.The ending leaves us with hope and comes as a real positive outcome -- not sure how a ""dark"" message could be taken from that.

The story is your basic poor kid with talent struggling to make it tale.  Think ""Rocky"" with a white rapper instead of boxer.  It is well told, and never drags.Eminem's acting was good, although a lot of that can be attributed to him basically playing himself.  But he doesn't hog the screen and turn this into a vanity piece.  Rather, he steps back and lets the other actors drive the movie.

Curtis Hanson, director, has always paid great attention to detail (think &quot;L A Confidential&quot;) and, once again, uses Kim Basinger to good advantage. Eminem, indeed, had a tough role; to maintain his identity while taking care of his crazy mother, and showing genuine love for his little sister; then, to deal with a flaky girlfriend and a gang of Detroit &quot;Urbanites&quot; (for wont of a better word). His performance is complete. There's a terrific 2.35:1 Widescreen, showing all the craziness of the audiences, and the bleakness of the slums. Powerful! My only complaint is, at the beginning, the music overpowered the dialogue quite often. The Sound director got it together about half way through, but there were some important dialogues at the beginning that helped you to know what his problem was, and it required a bit of attention. Eminem's music appeals to many (he wrote ALL of the music), but I chose to buy it because some reliable friends told me how good it was as drama. Yes, it's good. It's also one of those &quot;David &amp; Goliath&quot; films, where the underdog makes good. I actually like those kinds of films. Eminem did a fine job; but can he do &quot;Hamlet&quot;?

603334,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00005JLQE,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","8 Mile (Curtis Hanson, 2002)I had to rent it. I had to find out why Curtis Hanson, the director of such beautiful films as L. A. Confidential, Bad Influence, and The Hand that Rocks the Cradle could possibly see in the life story of Eminem. And whether you like this film or not is probably going to rest, in no small part, on how you see it. If it is meant as a biography of Eminem, it is unforgivably revisionist; if it is meant fictionally, it's at least partially redeemable.Hanson turns in his usual above-average direction, while Scott Silver (he of the timeless script for The Mod Squad) shows that he actually does have a modicum of screenwriting talent. His film is about as shallow as a desert pond, but he can do better than The Mod Squad, and did here. Add in Brian Grazer (a man whose output defines the term ""mediocre"") and Jimmy Iovine (I know music, I do. What's this ""film"" stuff?) as producers, and Eminemn doesn't have much going for him behind the scenes other than, well, Curtis Hanson.Somehow, Hanson managaes to almost putt his fat out of the fire. Eminem's charisma translates well into film. but that's about all that makes it worth watching. Brittany Murphy (The Prophecy II, Cherry Falls) is wooden, and her relationship with Eminem's character Bunny Rabbit is completely unbelievable... Now, for the good parts. Greg (Michael Shannon of Tigerland fame), Rabbit's high school classmate and now Stephanie's live-in boyfriend, finally drops the idea that he's not Ray Liotta, and takes on a role that has him looking and sounding as Liotta-like as possible. It works. Mekhi Phifer (O, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer), as Rabbit's best friend Future, finally gets his teeth into a role that allows him to shine. Between those two and Eminem, there's enough decent acting here to make it watchable.But is it the biography of Eminem that word on the street had it being? No way. The Eminem who wrote the songs on his first two albums is not the blue-collar I-love-my-family-and-defend-the-concept-of-homosexuality guy Rabbit is. It is tempting to see 8 Mile as another step in the sanitization of the image of Eminem; whether it is meant as biography or not, Eminem still comes off looking like he either isn't the person on his first two albums, or is trying to repent for that person.If you like Eminem, you've probably already seen it. If you don't, it's probably worth a rental. The documentary about the rap battles included as an extra on the DVD sums up a good portion of the reason why the parts of this film that don't work don't work. Hanson up on stage talking to a cast of three hundred fifty extras about kickin' it in rap battles and sounding Harvard-educated while doing it. Still, if you don't approach it too seriously, it's not a bad way to [spend] two hours. ** ",3,Eh.

Most of the people were between 12 and 24, and then, there was a smaller batch of people in their thirties through fifties-- the parents who drove the kids.But the truth is, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and it lived up to my expectations. It was so good it could win some awards. I had some justified trepidation about my almost 13 year old seeing, but wild horses couldn't have kept him from going.Of course, I couldn't be seen going in with him. He had to do it with his friends.So I went in alone and sat between other parents. One was sitting with her two boys, ready to tell them when to shut their eyes during the ""too sexy"" scene. When that scene arrived, it was not graphic, showing naked erotic zones. But it was clearly quick, shallow sex. I winced that my kid was watching it as I watched this mother sitting next to me trying to get her twelve year olds to cover their eyes. She didn't succeed. They half heartedly covered half of one eye. I couldn't resist saying to her, ""You can feel your grasp on them slipping away.""And I looked around the theater- the biggest of the megatheater's 24 rooms and saw a totally packed house, filled with kids mostly under 16.This is a story about a kid who starts our so afraid to sing in public, in a free style ""battle"" he pukes all over himself before going on stage. He's broken up with his pregnant girlfriend, given her his car and has to, oh so embarrassingly, go back to the trashy trailer where his alcoholic, ... mother lives.'Tis not a sweet smelling rose we watch here, but more like a coral reef, filled with beauty and sharp edges.Eminem does a superb job playing the lost kid who finds himself and his integrity. The music is rap throughout and this child of the sixties, who used to diss all rap, has learned to like the sound. I'm a liberal, who, when I heard about Eminem, and his attitude towards gays and women, thought little of him. He makes that up in this movie.... to an extent.It's worth seeing this. The third act shows Eminem facing his truth-- something the democrats could learn from, after last weeks political annihilation.Now, after seeing 8 Mile, I'm ready to go to a real battle of rappers.I still felt uncomfortable about my almost 13 year old seeing this. There was a lot of violence, profanity and three sex scenes that suggest the act. One with Kim Bassinger (probably a body double) and two with Brittany Murphy. Considering the setting for the story, the language was consistent. The sex was.... appropriate for an R rated film. The problem is, with the protagonist being a star whose fans are mostly under 16, they should have and could have cleaned up the script a bit, without hurting the story. At 57, director Curtis Hanson (also directed LA Confidential and Wonder Boys) is old enough to be grandfather of the kids in the audience.

603336,A16QODENBJVUI1,B00005JLQE,Robert Moore,"[4, 4]","I was extremely impressed with Eminem's screen debut, all the more so in that I am not at all a fan of rap.  Unlike many other musical performers who try their hand at acting, Eminem is a natural in front of the camera, never coming across like an actor wannabe, never having dreadful moments in the film like one finds in similar efforts by Mariah Carey or Madonna.  Moreover, the world in which Rabbit, the rapper Eminem portrays, lives is portrayed vividly and convincingly.  It is a bleak, unpleasant, unforgiving world that offers little in the way of a future.It is not a perfect film.  Some of the characters struck me more as caricatures, like Kim Basinger's portrayal of Rabbit's mother.  The mixture of friends wasn't completely convincing.  Brittany Murphy's character is so vague as to be indecipherable.  But despite the holes, the movie at its core is powerful and convincing.The central event of the film is the &quot;battle&quot; of rappers near the end.  At this point the movie feels more like a Western than anything, with young pretender to the crown of &quot;Fastest Gun in Town&quot; taking on and vanquishing all comers.  These are among the best scenes in the film.But in the end, many crucial issues are left untouched.  One of the central dilemmas and contradictions of Eminem's career is his being white but having excelled in an overwhelmingly black musical genre.  This crucial issue in Eminem's career was not addressed as explicitly in 8 MILE as I would have liked.  It is referred to, but for the most part Rabbit's presence on the rap scene is accepted more than discussed.  The central question of why a white kid would become a rapper is in the end not mentioned at all.  Why did Rabbit cross over to a black musical genre?  Interestingly, at one point in the film a movie is playing on TV.  I recognized it as Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE, a 1959 film in which a beautiful, light-skinned black girl passes for white, only to meet tragedy when the white kids discover she is black.  Clearly this is intended to hint at the danger Rabbit is encountering in crossing racial boundaries, but it still doesn't answer the question of why he wanted to cross over to begin with.  Why rap instead of punk?  Why hip hop instead of a predominantly white form of music?

603339,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00005JLQE,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 3]","Rapper Eminem makes a spectacular screen debut in ""8 Mile,"" a film designed to showcase the performer's talents as singer, songwriter and, now, actor.In this semi-autobiographical tale, Eminem plays a young white rapper named Jimmy who is struggling to achieve respectability and recognition in an area dominated almost exclusively by black artists.  We've seen this story before in films ranging from ""The Hustler"" to ""The Cincinnati Kid"" to ""Rocky"":  the hotshot, talented newcomer attempts to make a name for himself in some specialized area (be it pool, poker, boxing or rapping) by challenging and defeating the highly respected and established reigning champ.  In terms of plotting, ""8 Mile"" offers little that is new or exciting, but what makes the movie work is the fine sense of detail and texture that writer Scott Silver and director Curtis Hanson bring to the world they are showing us.  Set in 1995 Detroit, the film superbly captures the unmitigated bleakness of its urban setting:  from the burnt-out, abandoned buildings to the graffiti-covered walls to the dank, cavernous music clubs to the rundown trailer parks.  Jimmy is caught in a world that offers the poor working class stiff little opportunity for hopes and dreams beyond those he can make for himself - and Jimmy has found rap music to be the best chance for his ticket out.  Yet, Jimmy is no pie-in-the-sky idealist.  He knows that he can't afford to put all his eggs into one basket and so he remains levelheaded and pragmatic in his aspirations and goals.  Beyond the obvious handicap of his skin color, Jimmy is also having to cope with a crumbling relationship, an alcoholic mother, her abusive boyfriend and some ""concerned"" parties who, despite what they may say, may not always have Jimmy's best interest at heart.Each of these characters has the potential to become nothing more than a hokey stereotype, but the acting and the writing keep most of it real most of the time.  Kim Basinger, Mekhi Phifer, Britanny Murphy and several others all turn in fine performances in their roles, but it is Eminem himself who makes the film work.  Jimmy, despite all the frustration and rage smoldering under the surface, comes across as a decent guy who wants to make something of himself and to help those people who mean the most to him in the process.  Eminem is a natural on the screen, and it will be interesting to see if he will be able to so successfully inhabit a character who is not so carefully tailored to fit his ready-made persona.  My suspicion is that he will, though only time - and his next few roles - will tell.""8 Mile"" affords a fascinating glimpse into a subculture that many of us have hitherto viewed only from the outside.  Especially intriguing are the ""hip-hop battles,"" wherein rappers come on stage and challenge one another to perform spontaneous mutual put-downs, with the audience getting to determine the contest's winner.  No matter what one may feel about rap music itself, one has to admire the talent involved in composing these rhyming verses extemporaneously.  The music may sometimes be execrable, but the love of language that pours forth out of the mouths of these young practitioners is actually quite encouraging and captivating (though one wishes that that talent would be channeled in a more positive direction at times).An interesting side note:  at one point, Jimmy recites a rap defending a homosexual co-worker.  After all the bad blood that has gone down between Eminem and the gay community in the past, I wonder if this is the rapper's attempt to make peace and bury the hatchet.  If so, it is a gesture well worth making.",4,impressive acting debut,1048896000,"03 29, 2003",2003,3650,"['Rapper', 'Eminem', 'spectacular', 'screen', 'debut', '8', 'Mile', 'film', 'designed', 'showcase', 'performer', 'talents', 'singer', 'songwriter', 'now', 'semi-autobiographical', 'tale', 'Eminem', 'young', 'white', 'rapper', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'who', 'struggling', 'achieve', 'respectability', 'recognition', 'area', 'dominated', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'black', 'artists', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'films', 'ranging', 'Hustler', 'Cincinnati', 'Kid', 'Rocky', 'hotshot', 'talented', 'newcomer', 'attempts', 'make', 'name', 'specialized', 'area', 'be', 'pool', 'poker', 'boxing', 'rapping', 'challenging', 'defeating', 'highly', 'respected', 'established', 'reigning', 'champ', 'terms', 'plotting', '8', 'Mile', 'little', 'new', 'exciting', 'movie', 'work', 'fine', 'sense', 'detail', 'texture', 'writer', 'Scott', 'Silver', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'bring', 'world', 'are', 'showing', 'Set', '1995', 'Detroit', 'film', 'superbly', 'unmitigated', 'bleakness', 'urban', 'setting', 'burnt-out', 'abandoned', 'buildings', 'graffiti-covered', 'walls', 'dank', 'cavernous', 'music', 'clubs', 'rundown', 'trailer', 'parks', 'Jimmy', 'caught', 'world', 'poor', 'working', 'class', 'stiff', 'little', 'opportunity', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'can', 'make', 'Jimmy', 'found', 'rap', 'music', 'be', 'best', 'chance', 'ticket', 'out', 'Jimmy', 'pie-in-the-sky', 'idealist', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'put', 'eggs', 'one', 'basket', 'so', 'levelheaded', 'pragmatic', 'aspirations', 'goals', 'obvious', 'handicap', 'skin', 'color', 'Jimmy', 'also', 'having', 'cope', 'crumbling', 'relationship', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'abusive', 'boyfriend', 'concerned', 'parties', 'who', 'what', 'may', 'say', 'may', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'Jimmy', 'best', 'interest', 'heart.Each', 'characters', 'potential', 'become', 'nothing', 'more', 'hokey', 'stereotype', 'acting', 'writing', 'keep', 'most', 'real', 'most', 'time', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Britanny', 'Murphy', 'several', 'others', 'turn', 'fine', 'performances', 'roles', 'Eminem', 'who', 'film', 'work', 'Jimmy', 'frustration', 'rage', 'smoldering', 'surface', 'across', 'decent', 'guy', 'who', 'make', 'something', 'help', 'people', 'who', 'mean', 'most', 'process', 'Eminem', 'natural', 'screen', 'will', 'be', 'interesting', 'see', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'so', 'successfully', 'inhabit', 'character', 'who', 'not', 'so', 'carefully', 'tailored', 'fit', 'ready-made', 'persona', 'suspicion', 'will', 'only', 'time', 'next', 'few', 'roles', 'will', 'tell', '8', 'Mile', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'subculture', 'many', 'have', 'hitherto', 'viewed', 'only', 'outside', 'Especially', 'intriguing', 'are', 'hip-hop', 'battles', 'rappers', 'come', 'stage', 'challenge', 'one', 'perform', 'spontaneous', 'mutual', 'put-downs', 'audience', 'getting', 'determine', 'contest', 'winner', 'matter', 'what', 'one', 'may', 'feel', 'rap', 'music', 'admire', 'talent', 'involved', 'composing', 'rhyming', 'verses', 'extemporaneously', 'music', 'may', 'sometimes', 'be', 'execrable', 'love', 'language', 'mouths', 'young', 'practitioners', 'actually', 'quite', 'encouraging', 'captivating', 'one', 'talent', 'would', 'be', 'channeled', 'more', 'positive', 'direction', 'times', '.An', 'interesting', 'side', 'note', 'one', 'point', 'Jimmy', 'rap', 'defending', 'homosexual', 'co-worker', 'bad', 'blood', 'gone', 'down', 'Eminem', 'gay', 'community', 'past', 'wonder', 'rapper', 'attempt', 'make', 'peace', 'bury', 'hatchet', 'so', 'gesture', 'well', 'worth', 'making']",8 Mile

Following a low level plot line for most of the film, 8 Mile portrays Jimmy &quot;B Rabbit&quot; Smith (Eminem), a young, poor, struggling laborer living in a trailer in Detroit with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) and primary school aged sister. Jimmy is also an aspiring rapper, a rather obvious part of the movie as it is somewhat based on Eminem, who creates electrifying rhymes on the streets with friends and against rival crews. This movie takes a more sophistacated look than I would have expected at inner city life in a rough neighborhood and actually creates a sense of sympathy and hope for good will upon Rabbit that you would not expect to have for a gangster rapper. Urged by his friends to battle in local rap contests, Jimmy keeps refusing until he meets a girl at work (Britanny Murphy) who changes everything. At first Rabbit has trouble in battles and is swayed not to try again. But the movie is capped by a fantastic battle scene in which Eminem is spectacular.

Indeed it may be the 'Purple Rain' of our decade and is similar on several levels to the famous 80's movie starring Prince who battles his way from an alcoholic family and his own childhood demons to master the villianous musicians played by Morris Day and the Time.That said, 8 Mile is shot well and the performances are actually quite good in parts. Eminem bags special mention -- he is in surprisingly confident form given his first attempt on the silver screen. Kim Basinger is so good as the ... mom that it makes you wonder how she channeled that performance without a little trailer park in her blood.

603348,ABE14SVILZLNY,B00005JLQE,"SID ""Punk""","[0, 0]","I was talking last week to a female friend who had also seen `8 Mile.' She described it in a rather odd fashion as `ghettolicious' which kinda took me aback, but after musing on it over the time span of several classes, I realized that ghettolicious is the best way to sum up the film. It can be used to describe storyline, plot and characters, which would give me an easy one-word method for writing this review, but read on for the other words, please.In the slums of northern Detroit, a young dreamer, Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) a.k.a. Rabbit, is stuck in a vicious circle of working in a metal-stamping plant and living at home with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger), his innocent younger sister, and his mother's live-in boyfriend (who happens to be basically Smith's age). Rabbit's only hope of salvation is in his innate talent to rap.Rabbit does have one thing going for him-a solid core of friends including the influential Future (Mekhi Phifer), the good-hearted (yet argumentative) brothers, DJ Iz (De'Angelo Wilson) and Sol George (Omar Benson Miller) and the dimwitted follower Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones). Also (sorta) on Rabbit's side is his muse and lover Alex (Brittany Murphy).In the span of a week starting when Smith chokes in a rap insult battle, the viewer sees his fall to the bottom of his miserable existence to the inevitable rising from the ashes and trailer parks of the grittiest part of Detroit, the 8 Mile district.Firstly, I need to admit that I am not a very big fan of rap-in fact my CD collection mainly consists of artists who have been around long enough to have `Greatest Hits' albums out. Nonetheless, `8 Mile' drew me into the entertaining and diverse field of rap, which was excellently articulated in Eminem's rap-parody of `Sweet Home Alabama,' which was one of the highlights of the film. But despite the whole entertainment quality of the ghettolicious soundtrack, I doubt I will be heading out to supplement my music with rap, but that's no knock against the film.In his screen debut, I was expecting Eminem to fall flat on his face and turn in a train wreck of a performance. Instead, he was excellent, or in other words, ghettolicious, here, displaying multiple facets of a considerable talent for characterization. It was not quite an Oscar-worthy performance, but it does stick out at me as one of the top ten that I have seen this year.Also noteworthy was Kim Basinger's ghettolicious showing as a stereotypical white trailer-trash single woman with a drinking problem. Through her man problems to her bingo addictions to her hard-boozing habits, she walks the narrow line of being a character to be both pitied and despised for her weaknesses.Plotwise, well there really was not all that much worth mentioning-basically, it is a musical adaptation of `Rocky' with all the suspense of the ending of `Rocky IV' (along with some ghettolicious additions that make it more pathetic in setting and up-to-date in timing)(thanks to a fellow IMDb user for pointing that out!). Look at `Rocky' vs. `8 Mile'-young white protagonist with authority problems fights his way to an improbable victory while along the way meeting a woman that changes his life. It's been done before, but `8 Mile' adds ghettolicious scenes, quite a few F-bombs and a richer (yet grittier) coating that makes the whole package seem nearly new.Despite my lacking of a background in the world of rap (who said movie reviewers were perfect?), I was genuinely pleased by director Curtis Hanson's final product, and with maybe a bit more suspense added to the unavoidable ending, `8 Mile' would have been the best film I have seen this year. Regardless, `8 Mile' is an excellent and ghettolicious film deserving of a 5 out of 5.",5,8 M!LE !$ @ GHETT0L!C!0U$,1037318400,"11 15, 2002",2002,3737,"['was', 'talking', 'last', 'week', 'female', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'also', 'seen', '8', 'Mile', 'described', 'rather', 'odd', 'fashion', 'ghettolicious', 'kinda', 'took', 'aback', 'musing', 'time', 'span', 'several', 'classes', 'realized', 'ghettolicious', 'best', 'way', 'sum', 'up', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'describe', 'storyline', 'plot', 'characters', 'would', 'give', 'easy', 'one-word', 'method', 'writing', 'review', 'read', 'other', 'words', 'please.In', 'slums', 'northern', 'Detroit', 'young', 'dreamer', 'Jimmy', 'Smith', 'Jr.', 'Eminem', 'a.k.a', 'Rabbit', 'stuck', 'vicious', 'circle', 'working', 'metal-stamping', 'plant', 'living', 'home', 'alcoholic', 'mother', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'innocent', 'younger', 'sister', 'mother', 'live-in', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'be', 'basically', 'Smith', 'age', 'Rabbit', 'only', 'hope', 'salvation', 'innate', 'talent', 'rap.Rabbit', 'have', 'one', 'thing', 'going', 'him-a', 'solid', 'core', 'friends', 'including', 'influential', 'Future', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'good-hearted', 'yet', 'argumentative', 'brothers', 'DJ', 'Iz', ""De'Angelo"", 'Wilson', 'Sol', 'George', 'Omar', 'Benson', 'Miller', 'dimwitted', 'follower', 'Cheddar', 'Bob', 'Evan', 'Jones', 'Also', 'sorta', 'Rabbit', 'side', 'muse', 'lover', 'Alex', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', '.In', 'span', 'week', 'starting', 'when', 'Smith', 'chokes', 'rap', 'insult', 'battle', 'viewer', 'fall', 'bottom', 'miserable', 'existence', 'inevitable', 'rising', 'ashes', 'trailer', 'parks', 'grittiest', 'part', 'Detroit', '8', 'Mile', 'district.Firstly', 'need', 'admit', 'am', 'not', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'rap-in', 'fact', 'CD', 'collection', 'mainly', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'long', 'enough', 'have', 'Greatest', 'Hits', 'albums', 'out', 'Nonetheless', '8', 'Mile', 'drew', 'entertaining', 'diverse', 'field', 'rap', 'was', 'excellently', 'articulated', 'Eminem', 'rap-parody', 'Sweet', 'Home', 'Alabama', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'film', 'whole', 'entertainment', 'quality', 'ghettolicious', 'soundtrack', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'heading', 'supplement', 'music', 'rap', 'knock', 'film.In', 'screen', 'debut', 'was', 'expecting', 'Eminem', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'turn', 'train', 'wreck', 'performance', 'Instead', 'was', 'excellent', 'other', 'words', 'ghettolicious', 'here', 'displaying', 'multiple', 'facets', 'considerable', 'talent', 'characterization', 'was', 'not', 'quite', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'stick', 'out', 'one', 'top', 'ten', 'have', 'seen', 'year.Also', 'noteworthy', 'was', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'ghettolicious', 'showing', 'stereotypical', 'white', 'trailer-trash', 'single', 'woman', 'drinking', 'problem', 'man', 'problems', 'bingo', 'addictions', 'hard-boozing', 'habits', 'walks', 'narrow', 'line', 'being', 'character', 'be', 'pitied', 'despised', 'weaknesses.Plotwise', 'well', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'mentioning-basically', 'musical', 'adaptation', 'Rocky', 'suspense', 'ending', 'Rocky', 'IV', 'ghettolicious', 'additions', 'make', 'more', 'pathetic', 'setting', 'up-to-date', 'timing', 'thanks', 'fellow', 'IMDb', 'user', 'pointing', 'Look', 'Rocky', 'vs.', '8', ""Mile'-young"", 'white', 'protagonist', 'authority', 'problems', 'fights', 'way', 'improbable', 'victory', 'way', 'meeting', 'woman', 'life', 'been', 'done', '8', 'Mile', 'ghettolicious', 'scenes', 'quite', 'few', 'F-bombs', 'richer', 'yet', 'grittier', 'coating', 'whole', 'package', 'seem', 'nearly', 'new.Despite', 'lacking', 'background', 'world', 'rap', 'who', 'said', 'movie', 'reviewers', 'were', 'perfect', 'was', 'genuinely', 'pleased', 'director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'final', 'product', 'maybe', 'bit', 'more', 'suspense', 'added', 'unavoidable', 'ending', '8', 'Mile', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'year', 'Regardless', '8', 'Mile', 'excellent', 'ghettolicious', 'film', 'deserving', '5', '5']",8 Mile

603350,A15MLF38WROSWU,B00005JLQE,"S. M. Anderson ""sma331""","[2, 3]","I liked the movie. The acting was okay, and I enjoyed the rap battles. Eminem really surprised me. When I first heard about him doing this project, I just rolled my eyes and said &quot;great another hip hop artist, who thinks he can act&quot;. I mean just because Will Smith, Ice Cube, Mos Def, Queen Latifah, Heavy D, and LL Cool J......okay I digress. So some hip hop artist can actually act. His acting was actually okay. In fact if I had not known that this was his first acting role, I would have thought he had been acting for a while. He seems to be a natural. He did not over, or under act. He had me convinced each time he showed emotion. I was very impressed.Jimmy &quot;Rabbit&quot; Smith Jr. is down on his luck. He has to move back to the trailer park with his mom, and his littler sister, and the unemployed man his mom is seeing. The guy hates Jimmy, and Jimmy hates the guy. Nothing deep there. Jimmy has a car that likes to break down on him, and when he attempts to battle someone, he gets cold feet. Of course that was not good, and Jimmy feels he ruined any chance of seeing his dream as a hip hop star materialize, and he will never get out of 8 Mile. He works at an auto plant trying to save enough money to be able to afford some studio time. He has a bunch of friends who are in his corner. He shows major compassion for his friend Cheddar, especially when his friend gets trigger happy and accidentally shoots himself. He never teases Cheddar, but makes sure he is okay. His other friend &quot;Future&quot; is the MC at the hip hop battles, and he sees big things in &quot;Rabbit&quot;. He keeps encouraging Jimmy to do another battle, even though Jimmy does not have the confidence. His mom (Kim Bassinger) finds it more important to hid the fact she is about to get evicted from her boyfriend, then getting a job. The only way she seems to know how to get money is playing Bingo.The scene that really touched me was watching his sister Lily screaming while Jimmy is getting beat up. Her role is small, but you could just tell from that scene, she loves her brother, and does not want anything bad to happen to him. You also saw his concern for her, and it made me think that's how he talks to his daughter in real life. The scenes he did with Lily showed his tenderness. I really did not see the significance for the role that Alex (Brittany Murphey) played. Too me if she had not been in the film, it would not have made a difference.The movie is what it was meant to be. It was Entertaining and the extras were fun to watch. I laughed while watching the auditions for the extras to get in the battle scenes. Some of those folks were HORRIBLE, but again, it was fun to watch. You also get the video made for &quot;superman&quot; (I love that song!!! One of my favorites by Eminem). In fact after seeing the video, I actually bought his CD.One of the things I really liked, when Jimmy finally wins his battle, and gets his props, what does he do? He goes back to work at the auto plant. You don't get the &quot;sappy&quot; happy ending. Of course I was really curious if he had a job to back to. I mean he wanted to get extra shifts, and when he finally get the shift he wanted, he leaves a few hours to do his battle. I know I'm not the only one who noticed that. Xzhibt had a small cameo, battling Jimmy during a lunch break scene.This movie really surprised me, and I enjoyed it.

He was white and lived in a trailer on 8 Mile in Detroit, the line that seperates white from black neighborhoods, with his mother. He had a little sister that he loved and cared for like the dad he never knew. He had a hard labor job in a factory. He was sick of his life. He wanted to become a rapper. His break into the rap world could happen if he wins rap battles at a local club where he is seen as a failure. His life depends on that one shot. Will he take it?That sums up the story of 8 Mile, a surprisingly engaging flick directed by Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys) and starring rap sensation Eminem as Jimmy in his first big budget motion picture. The supporting cast includes Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as Jimmy's helpless mother, Mekhi Phifer as Jimmy's friend and coordinator of the rap battles at the club, and Brittany Murphy as Jimmy's love interest and local flirt.What struck me the most about 8 Mile is Eminem's performance. Usually, hip-hop and rap artists can't act if their lives depended on it, but Mr. Mathers surprises the audience with a virtual emotion, humor, and subtleness that carries the film well into the climactic scene at the end where Jimmy goes against the odds to prove to himself, his friends, family, and the world that he's not just another trailer dweller from around the corner.The movie features the Academy Award winning song Lose Yourself, co-written and sung by Eminem himself.RecommendedA-",5,Eminem's surprising performance carries the film,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1525,"['Once', 'time', 'was', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Jimmy', 'friends', 'called', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'was', 'white', 'lived', 'trailer', '8', 'Mile', 'Detroit', 'line', 'white', 'black', 'neighborhoods', 'mother', 'had', 'little', 'sister', 'loved', 'cared', 'dad', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'hard', 'labor', 'job', 'factory', 'was', 'sick', 'life', 'wanted', 'become', 'rapper', 'break', 'rap', 'world', 'could', 'happen', 'rap', 'battles', 'local', 'club', 'where', 'seen', 'failure', 'life', 'one', 'shot', 'Will', 'take', 'sums', 'up', 'story', '8', 'Mile', 'surprisingly', 'engaging', 'flick', 'directed', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'starring', 'rap', 'sensation', 'Eminem', 'Jimmy', 'first', 'big', 'budget', 'motion', 'picture', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winner', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'Jimmy', 'helpless', 'mother', 'Mekhi', 'Phifer', 'Jimmy', 'friend', 'coordinator', 'rap', 'club', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'Jimmy', 'love', 'interest', 'local', 'flirt.What', 'struck', 'most', '8', 'Mile', 'Eminem', 'performance', 'Usually', 'hip-hop', 'rap', 'artists', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'lives', 'depended', 'Mr.', 'Mathers', 'audience', 'virtual', 'emotion', 'humor', 'subtleness', 'film', 'well', 'climactic', 'scene', 'end', 'where', 'Jimmy', 'odds', 'prove', 'friends', 'family', 'world', 'not', 'just', 'trailer', 'dweller', 'corner.The', 'movie', 'Academy', 'Award', 'winning', 'song', 'Lose', 'Yourself', 'co-written', 'sung', 'Eminem', 'himself.RecommendedA-']",8 Mile
603353,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JLQE,S. Schell,"[0, 0]","Ever since his first single ""My Name Is"" hit the airwaves in 1998, Eminem has become a household name and with each album he releases, his listening audience is privy to the intimate details of his life.  His candid alliterations have alluded to his mother's drug abuse, his strained relationship and estrangement from ex-wife Kim, a tumultuous childhood and his troubles with the law.  Now comes a film that mirrors his hard-knock life and road to stardom (names and events changed for dramatic effect, of course).""8 Mile"" (an actual road in Michigan that separates Detroit proper from seven northern suburbs) is the story of Jimmy ""B-Rabbit"" Smith (Eminem), a down-on-his-luck Detroit mill worker with big dreams.  He and pals Future (Phifer), Cheddar Bob (Jones), Sol George (Miller) and Wink (Byrd) spend their time throwing random lyrics and frequenting ""The Shelter"", a local haunt in the Detroit suburbs where rhymesters gather to quash egos.  Unfortunately, Jimmy lacks confidence and when battling one evening, he ""chokes"" and decides never to go back.  But Future has glimpsed Jimmy's unusual talent and urges him to take another shot, a showdown in order with Papa Doc (Mackie), the defending champion.  While dealing with issues of low self-esteem and a reckless home life, Jimmy meets a runaway named Alex (Murphy) with dreams of her own. Assured by his friends of his talent and an acquaintance with contacts, Jimmy has a shot at a future in the music industry.  Will he put his scruples aside and go for it or will his anxiety overwhelm him and keep him not only in poverty but misery as well?Eminem does well in his first-ever movie role as Jimmy Rabbit, displaying a modest range of emotions and even a little bit of a soft side, something rarely seen from the man who has been labeled a hate-monger, misogynist and homophobe.  Phifer, whom I first remember seeing in the MTV Hip-Hopera ""Carmen"", does an admirable job as Future.  Murphy is merely an appendage, a love interest thrown in to produce more conflict but she does manage to create some steam with Eminem.  Kim Basinger is far from her sex kitten image as Stephanie, Jimmy's negligent and temperamental mother; after playing a Veronica Lake look-alike in Curtis Hanson's earlier flick ""L.A. Confidential"", Basinger is stripped down to the bare essentials.Bottom line: Most people will see this film simply for Eminem's motor-mouthed pace and the climax in which he returns to The Shelter to give all those creeps what-for.  I guess the pen can be mightier than the sword in this case.  Eminem fans will love this, in particular the soundtrack that supports it with the hit single ""Lose Yourself"".  Those looking for a remarkable dramatic performance from a multi-platinum selling hip-hop artist will see only mere glimpses, with little to suggest he will pursue a career in film (he's on hiatus as far as making his own music, choosing to produce for up-and-coming talents).

That having been said, this is a great film and Marshall Mathers was born to play this role.In other reviews I have read accounts of actors who played one part and then faded off into obscurity, never to be heard from again. I can only hope that this is the case with Emininem. As far as I can see playing Rabbit in 8 Mile is the one gleaming jewel in this man's career.I have no idea how autobiographical the plot is, but Rabbit's determination to persevere in the Rap Battles and the efforts he puts into his rhymes are inspirational. The ending is poetic and strangely fitting. This is not an device to promote a flash in the pan talent. It is a real film with weight and merit.The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Brittney Murphy does drama far better than her shot at goofy comedy in that Ashton Kutcher wedding flick. She grounds Rabbit and shows that with the love of the right woman any man can be saved.Kim Bassinger, though far too beautiful for the role, plays the trailer trash mother straight and poignantly. Her scenes with Mathers go from highly comic to suspenseful and dramatic.

603356,AL277B4AQCWBG,B00005JLQE,Steven Reynolds,"[3, 6]","These kind of movies have a formula, and ""8 Mile"" follows it religiously. Hose off the Detroit grit and the cliches are all there: the struggling talent; the quicksand of home life; the 'friend' with connections offering a fast track to success; the relationship subplot; and, of course, the climactic musical number that secures both moral and professional glory. So don't be surprised if you feel like you've seen this one before. But you will be surprised to find that Eminem can act. I mean really.  There isn't a single moment when you see through him, which is more than can be said for plenty of A-list Hollywood stars.  I was stunned.  Less impressive are the tortuously correct scenes where the one-time bad boy rewrites his own history by drawing a distinction between being gay and being 'a faggot'.  Yet despite such lapses, Scott Silver's screenplay forges a careful path between the irritating extremes of rap/hip-hop culture - its pseudo-intellectual ramblings on race politics, and the black fetishising of white wealth - to tell a story which is actually pro-family, pro-work and pro-individual effort. It's almost Protestant. But it still doesn't resolve rap culture's inherent contradictions. To wit: if living in 'the 313' - perfectly captured by director Hanson in all its horrific squalor - is so great, so 'real', then why is everyone, including our hero, so desperate to get out? And the villain's main crimes are to have a banal real name (Clarence), and to have gone to a private school. But where do you think little Lily will be headed the moment big bro' B Rabbit (with the no less banal real name of 'Jimmy Smith') makes his first million?  Don't try to resolve it, because you won't.  Just listen to the lyrics.  Eminem's closing track, ""Lose Yourself"", makes the argument in 5 minutes better than Silver's screenplay does in 110: it's all about seizing opportunities, about having enough faith to take a chance on yourself.  As a story about that kind of moment, ""8 Mile"" works better than most in the genre.",4,Best of the musician vanity films,1043712000,"01 28, 2003",2003,2040,"['kind', 'movies', 'have', 'formula', '8', 'Mile', 'religiously', 'Hose', 'off', 'Detroit', 'grit', 'cliches', 'are', 'there', 'struggling', 'talent', 'quicksand', 'home', 'life', ""'friend"", 'connections', 'offering', 'fast', 'track', 'success', 'relationship', 'subplot', 'course', 'climactic', 'musical', 'number', 'moral', 'professional', 'glory', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'before', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'Eminem', 'can', 'act', 'mean', 'really', ""n't"", 'single', 'moment', 'when', 'see', 'more', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'plenty', 'A-list', 'Hollywood', 'stars', 'was', 'stunned', 'Less', 'impressive', 'are', 'tortuously', 'correct', 'scenes', 'where', 'one-time', 'bad', 'boy', 'own', 'history', 'drawing', 'distinction', 'being', 'gay', 'being', 'faggot', 'such', 'lapses', 'Scott', 'Silver', 'screenplay', 'careful', 'path', 'irritating', 'extremes', 'rap/hip-hop', 'culture', 'pseudo-intellectual', 'ramblings', 'race', 'politics', 'black', 'fetishising', 'white', 'wealth', 'tell', 'story', 'actually', 'pro-family', 'pro-work', 'pro-individual', 'effort', 'almost', 'Protestant', 'still', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'rap', 'culture', 'inherent', 'contradictions', 'wit', 'living', '313', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'director', 'Hanson', 'horrific', 'squalor', 'so', 'great', 'so', ""'real"", 'then', 'why', 'everyone', 'including', 'hero', 'so', 'desperate', 'get', 'out', 'villain', 'main', 'crimes', 'are', 'have', 'banal', 'real', 'name', 'Clarence', 'have', 'gone', 'private', 'school', 'where', 'do', 'think', 'little', 'Lily', 'will', 'be', 'headed', 'moment', 'big', 'bro', 'B', 'Rabbit', 'less', 'banal', 'real', 'name', ""'Jimmy"", 'Smith', 'first', 'million', 'Do', ""n't"", 'try', 'resolve', 'wo', ""n't"", 'Just', 'listen', 'lyrics', 'Eminem', 'closing', 'track', 'Lose', 'argument', '5', 'minutes', 'better', 'Silver', 'screenplay', '110', 'seizing', 'opportunities', 'having', 'enough', 'faith', 'take', 'chance', 'story', 'kind', 'moment', '8', 'Mile', 'better', 'most', 'genre']",8 Mile

In this contrived rags-to-riches story, hip hop's great white hope Eminem is Rabbit, who struggles to hold down a job while living in a trailer park with his mom (Kim Basinger) and kid sister.  But Rabbit's skills as a rapper get the attention of his peers, who try to give him enough encouragement to compete in a heated hip hop face-off which may lead to a promising record deal.  Lacking both confidence and self-esteem, Rabbit avoids the challenge until he meets his love interest, played by Brittany Murphy.  From there begins an against-all-odds story that's been done before, but better (""Purple Rain"" and ""Rocky"").  Director Curtis Hanson (""Wonder Boys,"" ""L.A. Confidential"") takes a bizarre step backwards in this movie and fails to extract any genuine emotion from the cast or its settings.  The result is a film that's as processed as a Swanson TV dinner.  Scenes that are supposed to have emotional weight drew unintended laughs from this viewer, who was left baffled as to how this became a hit other than Eminem's bankability as a star.  Women don't get a fair shake in this movie, either, for they are portrayed as irresponsible, self-centered, and promiscuous.  And the scene where Rabbit defends a gay man seems like an all too calculated move to counter arguments that Eminem is homophobic.  Speaking of Emimen, it's hard to determine how good an actor he really is based on ""8 Mile.""  To his benefit, he appears natural and relaxed in front of the camera, but the story mirrors his own so closely that one could argue that he's merely playing himself.  The concept of acting is that you're stepping OUTSIDE of character when delivering a performance.  In this movie, Eminem stays well WITHIN character, so, thusly, there's no performance.  The hip hop themes, its Detroit location, and its script provide an all too secure safety net for the rapper.  Not that it will matter to 15-year-olds nationwide.  Surely, the time will come when Hollywood makes a gritty and powerful hip hop drama, but until then, we're gonna have to settle for movies like ""8 Mile.""",1,"No ""Mile""-age.",1047945600,"03 18, 2003",2003,2176,"['8', 'Mile', 'more', 'less', 'everything', 'trailer', 'promised', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'good', 'thing', 'contrived', 'rags-to-riches', 'story', 'hip', 'hop', 'great', 'white', 'hope', 'Eminem', 'Rabbit', 'who', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'living', 'trailer', 'park', 'mom', 'Kim', 'Basinger', 'sister', 'Rabbit', 'skills', 'rapper', 'get', 'attention', 'peers', 'who', 'try', 'give', 'enough', 'encouragement', 'compete', 'heated', 'hip', 'hop', 'face-off', 'may', 'lead', 'promising', 'record', 'deal', 'Lacking', 'confidence', 'self-esteem', 'Rabbit', 'challenge', 'love', 'interest', 'played', 'Brittany', 'Murphy', 'against-all-odds', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'Purple', 'Rain', 'Rocky', 'Director', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'Wonder', 'Boys', 'L.A', 'Confidential', 'bizarre', 'step', 'backwards', 'movie', 'extract', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'cast', 'settings', 'result', 'film', 'as', 'processed', 'Swanson', 'TV', 'dinner', 'Scenes', 'are', 'supposed', 'have', 'emotional', 'weight', 'drew', 'unintended', 'laughs', 'viewer', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'baffled', 'how', 'became', 'hit', 'other', 'Eminem', 'bankability', 'star', 'Women', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'fair', 'shake', 'movie', 'either', 'are', 'portrayed', 'irresponsible', 'self-centered', 'promiscuous', 'scene', 'where', 'Rabbit', 'gay', 'man', 'too', 'calculated', 'move', 'counter', 'arguments', 'Eminem', 'homophobic', 'Speaking', 'Emimen', 'hard', 'determine', 'how', 'good', 'actor', 'really', 'based', '8', 'Mile', 'benefit', 'natural', 'relaxed', 'front', 'camera', 'story', 'mirrors', 'own', 'so', 'closely', 'one', 'could', 'argue', 'merely', 'playing', 'concept', 'acting', ""'re"", 'stepping', 'OUTSIDE', 'character', 'when', 'delivering', 'performance', 'movie', 'Eminem', 'well', 'WITHIN', 'character', 'so', 'thusly', 'performance', 'hip', 'hop', 'themes', 'Detroit', 'location', 'script', 'too', 'secure', 'safety', 'net', 'rapper', 'Not', 'will', 'matter', '15-year-olds', 'nationwide', 'Surely', 'time', 'will', 'come', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'gritty', 'powerful', 'hip', 'hop', 'drama', 'then', ""'re"", 'gon', 'na', 'have', 'settle', 'movies', '8', 'Mile']",8 Mile
603361,A9U5CELFTZ4U8,B00005JLQE,"T. J. Bacon ""TJB""","[1, 2]","In BriefNo matter where we live, no matter who we are, we're all bound by borders, the people of Detroit know 8 Mile is the city limit, a border, a boundary. It is also a psychological dividing line that separates Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) from where he aspires to be.  Focusing around a week in the life of Jimmy, the story looks at his highs &amp; lows, from the realities of life to the escapism found in performing, discovering where his journey has taken him, and what he must do to strive to make the change.ReviewThe hype has died down and watching this again on the small screen at home still feels as engaging as it did in the cinema last year.  The common misconception about the movie relates to how much of the real Eminem one is seeing. While some similarities occur, it is far from being about the man himself.  Yet dotted around the film are some in-jokes and sly nudges that will mean more to the true fan such as the slow track into position of Jimmy sat beaten by life outside his trailer being identical to the iconic cover image of the Marshall Mathers LP.Rising from the grime, Eminem's performance is both powerful and competent, allowing us generally to feel the character as a real person and thus making any sudden bursts of passion or rage as justified as the silence that surrounds them.  This is not the Eminem you will see on the stage; a casual session of Mc-ing in a lunch line seems genuine as the quiet white guy chips in for the first time, and we gradually see his confidence build in front of us.  There is something, dated about the narrative of this movie, you know the story and the inevitable conclusion.  Yet it is told with a style and freshness that draws you in as you come to relate with the daily grind and suffering that the mundane existence of life inflicts upon each and everyone of 8 mile's inhabitants.  Upon a second viewing the opening sequence is as strong as ever, as the nerves of a first time performance get the better of Jimmy and we literally experience his tension from inside his head, blocking the world out through our headphones as we practise our performance from a dank disgusting toilet.Comparisons can easily be made to the underdog succeeding movies of the eighties such as Fame or Dirty Dancing, but neither come as close or as realistically to the work on offer here in anything other than a dated format.  In all honesty it is refreshing to see a group of people depicted in a film from a poor urban environment freak out at the sight of gun during a fight, rather than move to a mass response of automatic gunfire.  To put it simply this may not be Curtis Hanson's finest work but its certainly worth another viewing if not more, we all have to endure hardships but relatively few us bother to push ourselves, this film like its central figure will succeed in the decision to do it for itself.The VerdictThough the star &amp; director combined to produce a sure-fire hit, no one could have predicted if it would have any worth or merit.  Its not the finest film of all time by any length but it definitely knows its limits and works within them well.  While the DVD does seem to lack the gross of features many have today, among them are a few gems such as a never-to-be-released Eminem video &amp; 20 minutes of freestyle battles not featured in the movie. Its still the grittiest feel good film of the year and has some of the best beats on a soundtrack in a long time.  The bottom line: this is certainly not just another hip hop flick",4,KNOW YOUR BOUNDRIES.,1073433600,"01 7, 2004",2004,3512,"['BriefNo', 'matter', 'where', 'live', 'matter', 'who', 'are', ""'re"", 'bound', 'borders', 'people', 'Detroit', 'know', '8', 'Mile', 'city', 'limit', 'border', 'boundary', 'also', 'psychological', 'dividing', 'line', 'Jimmy', 'Smith', 'Jr.', 'Eminem', 'where', 'be', 'Focusing', 'week', 'life', 'Jimmy', 'story', 'highs', 'amp', 'lows', 'realities', 'life', 'escapism', 'found', 'performing', 'discovering', 'where', 'journey', 'taken', 'what', 'must', 'do', 'strive', 'make', 'change.ReviewThe', 'hype', 'died', 'down', 'watching', 'again', 'small', 'screen', 'home', 'still', 'as', 'engaging', 'did', 'cinema', 'last', 'year', 'common', 'misconception', 'movie', 'how', 'much', 'real', 'Eminem', 'one', 'seeing', 'similarities', 'occur', 'far', 'being', 'man', 'Yet', 'dotted', 'film', 'are', 'in-jokes', 'sly', 'nudges', 'will', 'mean', 'more', 'true', 'fan', 'such', 'slow', 'track', 'position', 'Jimmy', 'sat', 'beaten', 'life', 'trailer', 'being', 'identical', 'iconic', 'cover', 'image', 'Marshall', 'Mathers', 'LP.Rising', 'grime', 'Eminem', 'performance', 'powerful', 'competent', 'allowing', 'generally', 'feel', 'character', 'real', 'person', 'thus', 'making', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'passion', 'rage', 'as', 'justified', 'silence', 'not', 'Eminem', 'will', 'see', 'stage', 'casual', 'session', 'Mc-ing', 'lunch', 'line', 'genuine', 'quiet', 'white', 'guy', 'chips', 'first', 'time', 'gradually', 'see', 'confidence', 'build', 'front', 'something', 'dated', 'narrative', 'movie', 'know', 'story', 'inevitable', 'conclusion', 'told', 'style', 'freshness', 'come', 'relate', 'daily', 'grind', 'suffering', 'mundane', 'existence', 'life', 'inflicts', 'everyone', '8', 'mile', 'inhabitants', 'second', 'viewing', 'opening', 'sequence', 'as', 'strong', 'ever', 'nerves', 'first', 'time', 'performance', 'get', 'better', 'Jimmy', 'literally', 'experience', 'tension', 'head', 'blocking', 'world', 'out', 'headphones', 'practise', 'performance', 'dank', 'disgusting', 'toilet.Comparisons', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'made', 'underdog', 'succeeding', 'movies', 'eighties', 'such', 'Fame', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'neither', 'come', 'close', 'realistically', 'work', 'offer', 'here', 'anything', 'other', 'dated', 'format', 'honesty', 'refreshing', 'see', 'group', 'people', 'depicted', 'film', 'poor', 'urban', 'environment', 'freak', 'sight', 'gun', 'fight', 'rather', 'move', 'mass', 'response', 'automatic', 'gunfire', 'put', 'simply', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'Curtis', 'Hanson', 'finest', 'work', 'certainly', 'viewing', 'not', 'more', 'have', 'endure', 'hardships', 'relatively', 'few', 'bother', 'push', 'film', 'central', 'figure', 'will', 'succeed', 'decision', 'do', 'itself.The', 'VerdictThough', 'star', 'amp', 'director', 'combined', 'produce', 'sure-fire', 'hit', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'predicted', 'would', 'have', 'worth', 'merit', 'not', 'finest', 'film', 'time', 'length', 'definitely', 'limits', 'works', 'well', 'DVD', 'seem', 'lack', 'gross', 'features', 'many', 'have', 'today', 'are', 'few', 'gems', 'such', 'never-to-be-released', 'Eminem', 'video', 'amp', '20', 'minutes', 'freestyle', 'battles', 'not', 'featured', 'movie', 'still', 'grittiest', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'year', 'best', 'beats', 'soundtrack', 'long', 'time', 'bottom', 'line', 'certainly', 'not', 'just', 'hip', 'hop', 'flick']",8 Mile
603362,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,B00005JLQE,Todd7,"[0, 0]","I found 8 Mile to be a very enjoyable movie, thus exceeding my expectations. I'm not a rap fan, so I initially thought that I wouldn't enjoy this movie. I was wrong. Even more unexpected is the fact that Eminem gives a great performance in his acting debut; he seems to be a natural on the silver screen. I found his acting to be very genuine and real. Kim Basinger does a fine job as well, though it took some time to get used to her in her role as a struggling mother in a rough neighborhood. This movie has depth behind all the swearing, violence, etc. Detroit is depicted as poor, bleak, and violent in this movie, and we never see the downtown area and its buildings. This was most likely done to give the movie a rougher edge, and show the neighborhoods as a place of immense struggling. Whatever the case, this movie delivers, and surprisingly does so on an emotional level as well; Eminem's character shows compassion for others, and some of his friends do likewise. The only criticism I have of the acting is that it felt like some of the scenes depicting threats and violence seemed to display a small degree of tentativeness, as if the actors were holding back a tad bit, thus not making certain scenes totally believable. This is just my opinion, and I deem these miscues as minor. Overall, 8 Mile is a good movie that shows a struggle to make it out of an undesirable environment.

603365,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JLQE,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 5]","As many people have already said in their positive reviews, ""8 Mile"" is really a surprisingly good film, both gritty and truthful.  I know and you know that the film is NOT exactly what happened to Eminem, a now celebrated rapper with strong messages.  The film is a gentler and softer version of his real life, but thanks to the sure hand of director Curtis Hanson (LA Confidential fame), the total result is more than satisfactory.  And yes, though basically 'as himself', he can act pretty good.'8 Mile' is a real place in Detroit where Eminem is raised, and here stands as a symbol of the borderline where two kinds of people meet.  Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers III) plays his alter ego Jimmy 'Rabbit' Smith, who struggles to make it in rap music where black people are dominant.  But at the crutial moment during the amateur contest for rappers (the battle, they call it), his tongue which should be always acid fails him.Then the film follows the life of Jimmy and his friends, and how he finds the way he should live his life in spite of his messy surroundings including his girlfriend (Brittany Murphey) and his mother (Kim Basinger).  The final scenes, even for the audiences like me who don't know much about rap music, are very exciting and rousing.  In fact we come to like this guy Jimmy.For his avid fans, the film may look too tame, but you have to admit that film is made for wider audience in mind.  Jimmy has a sister, but fans might instead remember his (Eminem's) own daughter when looking at her.  But forget those things outside the screen for a while.  This is a story about an angry man who doesn't know into what kind of shapes he should turn the enormous anger.The film has very authentic atmosphere of Detroit, and does not fail to reflect the social background of the characters.  But as I said, we should watch this one as a story with universal appeal.  If you don't like hip-hop or rap, never mind.  You just don't have to.

603366,A28GZ5XS8DE660,B00005JLQE,Tyler Disley,"[2, 3]","8 Mile isn't your typical rapper movie by any lengths.  It has established actors with a terrific director, and the big bonus is that the rapper himself can actually act.Eminem proves to the whole world that he isn't a one dimensional celebrity and can hold his own with the best of them (i.e. Kim Basinger).  Does he deserve an Oscar, though?  Absolutely not, not even close.  But, in an increasingly popular trend where music stars cross over into the movie industry, he topples them all.  This isn't unprecedented with the likes of Madonna making the switch, but it's always intriguing and quite surprising when a rapper can make the transition so easily and smoothly.There are some Hollywoodish qualities in the movie, and that just makes it interesting.  What movie has ever been made that the ""based on"" storyline isn't tweaked here and there to make it an interesting movie?8 Mile didn't jump down any levels on the side stories, like so many movies in this genre do.  There wasn't a point in the movie that I felt bored or turned off, which is what one would expect from a movie with Eminem cast as the lead.By the end of the movie, I felt a genuine sympathy for Rabbit and wanted nothing more than to see him prevail against all odds.

603367,A1WL2EKE4TAEJP,B00005JLQE,"Tyler Durden ""Mutton Man""","[0, 0]","I remember seeing this movie for the first time... two years ago! Man... has it been THAT long already? Around that time, I was a Senior in high school. Oh how times move fast...I remember seeing this movie twice. The first time was with my brother. The theater was packed, but we both enjoyed the film. The second time... well, it was really an unscheduled event. A friend of mine (who happens to be a girl) wanted to watch it. She begged me to take her, so I gave in and decided to take her along. We were also to see it with a friend, but she dropped out at the last minute. So... our movie time turned into an unintentional ""date."" Since then, this movie always reminds me of that. We were unusually quiet most of the time... but we still ended up having fun. Little did we realize that we would then become good friends, later to become ""more than friends."" Was it because of this movie? I don't know... but I'd thought I'd begin my review with a short background of my experience.The ""8 Mile"" fever struck our little town on the Rez. Flocks of Eminem fans flooded the theaters. And I would be one of 'em. The story, as everyone knows, is a ""semi-autobiographical"" account of Eminem's personal life. A bummed-out Detroit punk trying to escape from the city, and the only way he can is to get a record deal. Eminem plays Jimmy Smith, Jr., aka ""B. Rabbit."" He's had a rough time with ""rap battles"" since he freezes on stage. He's got friends to provide some guidance (okay, maybe just ""Future,"" played by Mekhi Phifer). The other three involves one that preaches and [...] about how screwed up Detroit is. The other two, a big-boned fella and a junkie-looking white guy, seem to be the comic-relief characters. The ""bad guys"" are the rap battle-winning gang, the Free World.Jimmy also has a mother (Kim Basinger) and a lil' sister. More serious problems arise in his household when his ma's place is in danger of eviction. His ma also has a man that Jimmy doesn't get along with very well. Jimmy lives there but doesn't want anyone to know. B. Rabbit also has a little ""love interest,"" though it's probably not called that. A young woman, played by Brittany Murphy, also shares the dream of leaving Detroit. You'd think more would develop here, but it doesn't. Just a steamy sex-scene, then both part ways.Em pulls off a hell of good performance, but... to quote Ebert's buddy, Richard Roeper: ""While Eminem's role is obviously no stretch, he's really good at playing a version of himself."" But that doesn't mean Eminem isn't a good actor. He pulls off a real performance. He shows his true self. Maybe more would've been nice... maybe ""8 Mile part 2"" could have that... that is, if a sequel is planned.The DVD has a few plus features. They talk about how each rap battle in the movie HAD to be filmed since the rappers can only pull off their performance one time. There's also some free-styling rap battles with other people who were up to challenging Em (these are real, by the way). And a ""nasty"" music video of Em's ""Superman"" song.The movie could be inspirational for those that want to succeed at something. People, especially those around my area, are like Jimmy Smith. They want to leave their hometown to pursue the big life in a big city. Or just simply get out of town. In truth, we all want to pursue that opportunity. Even I myself want to pursue that dream. We just have to work at it, then eventually, it'll come. That's what the movie is about, isn't it? It isn't just going to see how well Eminem acts... the movie can inspire people to get that dream (though not exactly a rap career like in the movie, obviously).Like how the song goes:""Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunityTo seize everything you ever wanted... in One momentWould you capture it or just let it slip?""Because, my friend, that's the movie's main message.Oh well...

History is littered with musicians who've tried to break in to Hollywood and failed miserably. Examples: Lance Bass, Mick Jagger(was I the only one who saw 'Freejack'?), Madonna (I actually wasted Xmas day one year watching Evita).Let's face it, 70% of us are going to go see this to see if Marshall Mathers can act, yes he can.  With parts of the movie loosely based on his life you can really see that he probably wasn't doing much acting. The story is good and Em just makes it seem to come naturally. Truthfully this movie keeps it real. There is no one moment where you know everything is going to be ok and our protagonist is suddenly surrounded by wealth. You just get the feeling in the end that there is hope. You really get the feeling that there is a bond between he and his friends all throughout the movie even during a small 'trife' towards the movie's climax.I think the fact that you get to see Kim Basinger in the same frame as Em is almost worth the price of a ticket. And I am a bit confused as to whether or not I didn't like Britney Murphy's character or I simply didn't like the part for Britney Murphy, but Im leaning toward the latter.If you're still worried that Musicians should never cross the line into acting, Forget 'Deseratley Seeking Susan' and 'Who's that girl', leave your fears at the ticket counter and give this one a chance.

So there is obviously something in there to turn it around.Ok, so I had absolutely no idea what people were saying for vast amounts of the film, I just managed to keep a hold of what was being rapped during the 'battles' and I followed the story by keeping my wits and looking for advice from the other people watching.The story basically follows the young white rapper 'Bunny Rabbit' (How this guy got into as few fights as we saw with that name I didn't know) as he struggled, not so much to get noticed and recognised, but to pull out of himself the raw talent he and his friends knew he had.Until this film he was an unknown, but respected within his group as good. By the end of this film by overcoming a variety of problems, being knocked back, getting a little luck, but overall walking in the right direction and trying to keep life on track (in a very subtle unspoken way too) he becomes a man who has opened a door, expressed his talent, proven he can cut it.At times some of the things that happen appear almost random, without justification or motive, but then, that is not to say its wrong. That is obviously the way life works here. Its not so much a feature film as a semi fictional documentary to give you some insight, some fun and some shocks. Its certainly enjoyable whether a fan of Eminem or not, in fact the only song from the soundtrack that seems to appear in the film is the title track. Its true if you hate rap you are going to hate this film, but liking it is not so much a requirement as an added benefit.My only real down point was that come the end, it finished. Abruptly. Walking off 'into the sunset' goes our young Eminem with so many unanswered questions. What comes next? What happens to his friends? Where does 'the girl' go? But while I thought about this I think I concluded that its good it finished like that.

Well, Eminem shows he's a great actor and the movie is very good... The 2003 Oscar Winner for Best Song (Lose Yourself, by Eminem), 8Mile is now on DVD...It's about a white guy who wants to have fame in hip hop world, his name is Jimmy Smith Jr., known as B Rabbit along his friends. The movie starts out with a rap battle, and he's defeated. It takes the whole movie for him to win the ultimate battle (a very exciting scene).The 5.1 Surround sound is amazing, the image is much better than many others DVDs I own. The extras are great too! Check the main extras out:- The Making-Of 8Mile: It's not a huge making of, but it shows some things you might be interested in knowing.. Why did they decide to make this movie, and many other things.- Rap Battles: In the Shelter (the place where rap battles happen in the movie), there is the crowd who judges the rappers. Between takes, they were getting really bored, so the director made a contest: ""Are you 'good' enough to battle Eminem""? Some people tried, until four were selected to battle him. What happened? Well, watch it! Very funny!- ""Superman"" Music Video: This is one of the best extras. This video clip will never be on TV because it is really explicit, but it is one of Eminem's best video clips ever.. Exciting!The movie is rated R because of strong language (those words, you know... F-word, S-word, N-word...), Sexuality (it has three sex scenes, but not explicit ones), some violence (a Rabbit friends shoots himself with his own gun in the leg, Rabbit is beaten up, no big thing...) and drug use (Rabbit's friends smoke marijuana).If you are a hip-hop fan, you might really like this DVD.
