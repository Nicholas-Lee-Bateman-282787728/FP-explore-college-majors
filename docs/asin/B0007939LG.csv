First, the common theme is ""New York NEEDED this World Series in it's recovery from September 11"" and ""New York DESERVED this World Series"" and ""It was America v. Arizona,"" etc.  Never mind that the Yankees payroll was three times that of Arizona and that the Yankees had won four of the previous five October classics- nope, they were SUPPOSED to win this one because...um, well, because terrorists attacked New York, I guess.The DVD also doubles as a campaign commercial for Rudy Giuliani, who manages to appear in WAY too many segments.  One of the most unintentionally funny moments comes when the series goes back to Arizona and one of the Mayor's spokesmen talks about the ""tough decision"" concerning whether Giuliani should fly to Phoenix to be there- ""what if we were attacked again in his absence?""  Hmm, yeah, what if? I guess NYC would have had to get by without the Mayor wandering around the rubble looking for his command center with a bullhorn in his hand.Another great moment comes when a Pwecious Wittle Girl reads a letter she wrote to Derek Jeter about how she weally, weally woves him and hopes he wins the whole thing.  I had to pause the DVD and go brush my teeth after that part.There's a lot more, but the message woven throughout the film remains the same- the people of NYC are Heroes who were Bent but not Broken, the New York Yankees ARE the city of NY, and it was Wrong and Bad for the Diamondbacks to win that Series.  It was as if the Terrorists had Won.Watch the DVD with some friends for a laugh, and supply plenty of booze.

878221,A23SFPMLXY4J1H,B0007939LG,"W. C. Bonner ""young fogey""","[14, 39]","One of the most monumental events in the history of American sports, the 2001 World Series is perhaps more worthy than any other sports topic of a comprehensive, informed and inspired film document. This film is not that document.The premise of the filmmakers is that the New York Yankees, because they chose to play after September 11 rather than abandoning the season, should be regarded as saints. They then maintain that it was the patriotic duty of the Yankees' opponents to roll over and lose in order to improve the moods of their non-playing interview subjects (all New Yorkers). Meanwhile, the players responsible for the most courageous and inspiring performance in baseball history are cast as villains, and the city that experienced the greatest moment of sports-inspired civic pride in American history is ignored.Here are three reasons why this World Series will be talked about in 2051 that were barely, if it all, talked about in this movie:1. There has never been a greater contrast in the backgrounds of the two participants in a professional sports championship: the most celebrated, decorated team in American sports history against one that was only playing its fourth season. The Yankees were fielding teams when Arizona was not even a state! I would make the argument that not only was this the most important event in Arizona SPORTS history, but by way of having so little traditionally defined history, this was the biggest thing ever to happen in Arizona period!2. By virtue of becoming the first pitcher to win three games in one series since Mickey Lolich, Randy Johnson became the unchallenged star of the series. The most spectacular pitching performer since Nolan Ryan, this series marked his transformation from star to legend. While it's unfortunate that he did not make himself available for interviews that is no reason to be giving him passing mentions instead of prominent ones.3. There is no more magical moment in sports than a bottom-of-the-ninth come from behind rally by the home team to win the seventh game of a World Series. What will place this in the realm of the greatest sports legends is that it occurred in the context of a blown save by the greatest relief pitcher in the history of the game.For Pete's (and Pinnacle Peak's) sake let's all hope that fans from both of these cities someday get the film about this series that they deserve.",2,parochial and myopic,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",2006,2390,"['One', 'most', 'monumental', 'events', 'history', 'American', 'sports', '2001', 'World', 'Series', 'perhaps', 'more', 'worthy', 'other', 'sports', 'topic', 'comprehensive', 'informed', 'inspired', 'film', 'document', 'film', 'not', 'document.The', 'premise', 'filmmakers', 'New', 'York', 'Yankees', 'chose', 'play', 'September', '11', 'rather', 'abandoning', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'saints', 'then', 'maintain', 'was', 'patriotic', 'duty', 'Yankees', 'opponents', 'roll', 'over', 'lose', 'order', 'improve', 'moods', 'non-playing', 'interview', 'subjects', 'New', 'Yorkers', 'Meanwhile', 'players', 'responsible', 'most', 'courageous', 'inspiring', 'performance', 'baseball', 'history', 'are', 'cast', 'villains', 'city', 'experienced', 'greatest', 'moment', 'sports-inspired', 'civic', 'pride', 'American', 'history', 'ignored.Here', 'are', 'three', 'reasons', 'why', 'World', 'Series', 'will', 'be', 'talked', '2051', 'were', 'barely', 'talked', 'movie:1', 'never', 'been', 'greater', 'contrast', 'backgrounds', 'two', 'participants', 'professional', 'sports', 'championship', 'most', 'celebrated', 'decorated', 'team', 'American', 'sports', 'history', 'one', 'was', 'only', 'playing', 'fourth', 'season', 'Yankees', 'were', 'fielding', 'teams', 'when', 'Arizona', 'was', 'not', 'even', 'state', 'would', 'make', 'argument', 'not', 'only', 'was', 'most', 'important', 'event', 'Arizona', 'SPORTS', 'history', 'way', 'having', 'so', 'little', 'traditionally', 'defined', 'history', 'was', 'biggest', 'thing', 'ever', 'happen', 'Arizona', 'period', '2', 'virtue', 'becoming', 'first', 'pitcher', 'win', 'three', 'games', 'one', 'series', 'Mickey', 'Lolich', 'Randy', 'Johnson', 'became', 'unchallenged', 'star', 'series', 'most', 'spectacular', 'pitching', 'performer', 'Nolan', 'Ryan', 'series', 'marked', 'transformation', 'star', 'legend', 'unfortunate', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'available', 'interviews', 'reason', 'be', 'giving', 'passing', 'mentions', 'instead', 'prominent', 'ones.3', 'more', 'magical', 'moment', 'sports', 'bottom-of-the-ninth', 'come', 'rally', 'home', 'team', 'win', 'seventh', 'game', 'World', 'Series', 'What', 'will', 'place', 'realm', 'greatest', 'sports', 'occurred', 'context', 'blown', 'save', 'greatest', 'relief', 'pitcher', 'history', 'game.For', 'Pete', 'Pinnacle', 'Peak', 'sake', 'let', 'hope', 'fans', 'cities', 'someday', 'get', 'film', 'series', 'deserve']",Nine Innings From Ground Zero: The 2001 World Series
878222,A2STDDBMI6CIPA,B0007939LG,"W. gallegos ""wg6175""","[33, 38]","Being a west-coast sports fan,I have always hated the Yankees. I don't know what got me into buying this dvd but I must say that I am glad I did. This documentary is the story about the city of New York and one of their most beloved sports teams getting by one of the most horrific events in both New York and American History...9/11. If this tragedy was the illness,then the love of Yankee baseball was the cure. While watching ""Nine innings from ground zero"",my hate towards this team was put aside while watching it as I got to see the side of Yankee stars that one doesn't see off the field. From the young girl who met Derek Jeter after he learned through her letter that she lost her father in the towers...to the firefighters who put on a smile thanks to a surprise visit from Yankee players...to the group of family members of 9/11 victims who got to attend the world series,I was deeply moved by this documentary. We,the sports fans,are so used to hearing stories about too many sport stars who get in trouble with the law or stars who complain about a 7 to 8 figure contract not being enough,that we seem to forget about the few out there who have alot of good in them. The documentary even has an interview with President George Bush that I am glad was included. I don't care if the war in Iraq is right or wrong nor do I care what party he is. It is a proud moment watching the leader of your country throw out the first pitch at the 2001 World Series while the crowd chants...U-S-A...U-S-A!!! I believe this first pitch is the most memorable one on film to date. After watching Nine innings...,am I still a Yankee hater? Yeah,but I love them for bringing hope and smiles to the people of New York. This dvd is recommended to both the sports fan and non-sports fan. All will not be disappointed.

878223,AP3B615GM191G,B0007939LG,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 3]","All too often, I think that baseball fans get a bit too caught up in the everyday minutiae of the game to reflect on what the sport really means to them.  A few examples would be criticizing the manager for a pitching change or getting on the case of a batter in a terrible slump.  However, this DVD will remind you that the game of baseball stands for so much more.This documentary really shines on two different levels.  First, is the action transpiring on the field.  Starting with President George W. Bush throwing out the opening pitch (a perfect strike) at Yankee Stadium on the first night back after the terrible 9/11 disaster, the film chronicles the Yankees' amazing run to a division title, a playoff series (against Oakland) that might have been lost if not for Derek Jeter sprinting out of nowhere, and the intensely dramatic World Series that, although it didn't end well for NY, contained a decade-worth of Yankee Stadium drama.  The filmmakers are able to very effectively turn those events into a sort of metaphor for the city of New York.The second level this movie succeeds on is in recounting the personal stories that were going on ""behind the scenes"" while the Yankees and Mets were doing their best to entertain the masses.  In one instance, a young girl who lost her father on 9/11 only began finding herself again after a simple phone conversation with Derek Jeter.  On other occasions, NYC firefighters and rescue workers were touched by personal appearances from Yankee players, allowing them (if only for a brief time) to think of something other than the terrible events that were involved in.  Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is also a very articulate presence throughout the film, as his words serve as a representation for the entire New York population at that time.  Despite their sorrow, they wanted to see their Yankees.As a person who has also experienced a difficult time in my life and been helped through it by the steadying presence of baseball, I found this documentary to be a very accurate portrayal of the lingering emotions during that time period.  Through all the fear and anxiety, the sport of baseball was able to provide fans a respite (even if at first they were wary of looking at anything the same again) from the shocking events/changes around them.  And that, ultimately, is the legacy of this fine sport...bringing people together over a common interest.Thus, I recommend viewing this film on every September 11th from now until eternity, as it will help you remember how a frightened nation was helped to be resurrected by a simple (yet oh so grand) game.",5,A Tear-Jerker That Shows What Baseball Is Really All About,1245628800,"06 22, 2009",2009,2622,"['too', 'often', 'think', 'baseball', 'fans', 'get', 'bit', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'everyday', 'minutiae', 'game', 'reflect', 'what', 'sport', 'really', 'few', 'examples', 'would', 'be', 'criticizing', 'manager', 'pitching', 'change', 'getting', 'case', 'batter', 'terrible', 'slump', 'However', 'DVD', 'will', 'remind', 'game', 'baseball', 'stands', 'so', 'much', 'more.This', 'documentary', 'really', 'shines', 'two', 'different', 'levels', 'First', 'action', 'transpiring', 'field', 'Starting', 'President', 'George', 'W.', 'Bush', 'throwing', 'out', 'opening', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'strike', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'first', 'night', 'back', 'terrible', '9/11', 'disaster', 'film', 'Yankees', 'amazing', 'run', 'division', 'title', 'playoff', 'series', 'Oakland', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'lost', 'not', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'sprinting', 'nowhere', 'intensely', 'dramatic', 'World', 'Series', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'well', 'NY', 'contained', 'decade-worth', 'Yankee', 'Stadium', 'drama', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'able', 'very', 'effectively', 'turn', 'events', 'sort', 'metaphor', 'city', 'New', 'York.The', 'second', 'level', 'movie', 'recounting', 'personal', 'stories', 'were', 'going', 'scenes', 'Yankees', 'Mets', 'were', 'doing', 'best', 'entertain', 'masses', 'one', 'instance', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'lost', 'father', '9/11', 'only', 'began', 'finding', 'again', 'simple', 'phone', 'conversation', 'Derek', 'Jeter', 'other', 'occasions', 'NYC', 'firefighters', 'rescue', 'workers', 'were', 'touched', 'personal', 'appearances', 'Yankee', 'players', 'allowing', 'only', 'brief', 'time', 'think', 'something', 'other', 'terrible', 'events', 'were', 'involved', 'Former', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Mayor', 'Rudy', 'Giuliani', 'also', 'very', 'articulate', 'presence', 'film', 'words', 'serve', 'representation', 'entire', 'New', 'York', 'population', 'time', 'sorrow', 'wanted', 'see', 'Yankees.As', 'person', 'who', 'also', 'experienced', 'difficult', 'time', 'life', 'been', 'helped', 'steadying', 'presence', 'baseball', 'found', 'documentary', 'be', 'very', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'lingering', 'emotions', 'time', 'period', 'fear', 'anxiety', 'sport', 'baseball', 'was', 'able', 'provide', 'fans', 'respite', 'even', 'first', 'were', 'wary', 'looking', 'anything', 'same', 'again', 'shocking', 'ultimately', 'legacy', 'fine', 'sport', 'bringing', 'people', 'together', 'common', 'interest.Thus', 'recommend', 'viewing', 'film', 'September', '11th', 'now', 'eternity', 'will', 'help', 'remember', 'how', 'frightened', 'nation', 'was', 'helped', 'be', 'resurrected', 'simple', 'yet', 'oh', 'so', 'grand', 'game']",Nine Innings From Ground Zero: The 2001 World Series
