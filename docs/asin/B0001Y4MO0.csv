Watch especially for the scene on the corner of 1st Place and Court St, there is Sergi's  Candy store (now known as ""Thakor Brothers"" newsstand), then the reverse angle across the street and we see the ""Brand New"" Citibank which is still there! You can also see  ""The Pub"" on the corner of Carroll St and Court St.  That's not all! The next scene is shot on the corner of 2nd Place and Court St. You see a nice shot of the  old ""A & P"" Supermarket, and the old fashioned lamp post that used to be on the corner! For other cool Carroll Gardens movie scenes see ""The Idolmaker"" from 1979 (nice shots of Luquer St and Smith St and Nelson) and the brief scene in Goodfellas shot on W 9th Street and Smith St.",3,Features Carroll Gardens footage from 1974!,1131408000,"11 8, 2005",2005,816,"['Wow', 'really', 'cool', 'scenes', 'shot', 'Carroll', 'Gardens', 'Brooklyn', '1974', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'just', 'known', 'Red', 'Hook', 'Watch', 'especially', 'scene', 'corner', '1st', 'Place', 'Court', 'St', 'Sergi', 'Candy', 'store', 'now', 'known', 'Thakor', 'Brothers', 'newsstand', 'then', 'reverse', 'angle', 'street', 'see', 'Brand', 'New', 'Citibank', 'still', 'can', 'also', 'see', 'Pub', 'corner', 'Carroll', 'St', 'Court', 'St.', 'That', 'not', 'next', 'scene', 'shot', 'corner', '2nd', 'Place', 'Court', 'St.', 'see', 'nice', 'shot', 'old', 'A', 'P', 'Supermarket', 'old', 'fashioned', 'lamp', 'post', 'used', 'be', 'corner', 'other', 'cool', 'Carroll', 'Gardens', 'movie', 'scenes', 'see', 'Idolmaker', '1979', 'nice', 'shots', 'Luquer', 'St', 'Smith', 'St', 'Nelson', 'brief', 'scene', 'Goodfellas', 'shot', 'W', '9th', 'Street', 'Smith', 'St']",Super Cops

817037,A16XRPF40679KG,B0001Y4MO0,Michael Dobey,"[4, 4]","These cops were the real deal, the early 70's were a time of corruption and disolution in the police departments. Drugs were destroying society and yet popular sentiment was against the cops doing their jobs to stop hard dope. Plus corruption was so bad that these two cops were seen as bad for wanting to bust criminals. Why would they do it even on their time off? They had to fight against beaucracy and the streets as well. They weren't for sale and by the late seventies many cops were in jail and many district attorneys and judges too evidently. These guys story is told here simply and honestly. Every police officer should watch this movie and so should anybody who gives a damn about making things better. That's really what these guys were after. The lead actors are truly natural and lay it down in a understated way that's true to life. Honestly this is one of the best cop movies ever imo. The dvd looks ok and I personally hope that there is a blu ray release somday of this important story made.",5,real heroes that made a difference,1310256000,"07 10, 2011",2011,1011,"['cops', 'were', 'real', 'deal', 'early', '70', 'were', 'time', 'corruption', 'disolution', 'police', 'departments', 'Drugs', 'were', 'destroying', 'society', 'yet', 'popular', 'sentiment', 'was', 'cops', 'doing', 'jobs', 'stop', 'hard', 'dope', 'corruption', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'two', 'cops', 'were', 'seen', 'bad', 'wanting', 'bust', 'criminals', 'Why', 'would', 'do', 'even', 'time', 'off', 'had', 'fight', 'beaucracy', 'streets', 'as', 'well', 'were', ""n't"", 'sale', 'late', 'seventies', 'many', 'cops', 'were', 'jail', 'many', 'district', 'attorneys', 'judges', 'too', 'evidently', 'guys', 'story', 'told', 'here', 'simply', 'honestly', 'Every', 'police', 'officer', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'so', 'should', 'anybody', 'who', 'damn', 'making', 'things', 'better', 'really', 'what', 'guys', 'were', 'lead', 'actors', 'are', 'truly', 'natural', 'lay', 'down', 'understated', 'way', 'true', 'life', 'Honestly', 'one', 'best', 'cop', 'movies', 'ever', 'imo', 'dvd', 'ok', 'personally', 'hope', 'blu', 'ray', 'release', 'somday', 'important', 'story', 'made']",Super Cops

They were ready to go as soon as they hit the police academy. Working as a big city cop your ready to jump in and clean up the streets. These men had to jump through a lot of hoops and there hearts were in the right place. But there are specific departmental procedures, general orders and the police manual that you have to follow and if you don't your life as a police officer can be a living hell. Plus there are crooked and lazy cops, crooked and lazy supervisors, supervisors who are afraid of there own shadows and shaky/crooked DA's that they had to deal with. This stuff wouldn't fly in this day and time. These guys were a teriffic team no doubt and they did what they had to do. The movie plot was good, the acting was done well, the story line was great and it had a prefect ending. However. The cinematography could have been better as the movie was grainey and it looked like the DVD was copied from a VHS tape. Other then that I give it 4 stars.
