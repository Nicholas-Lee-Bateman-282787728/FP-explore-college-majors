Parker, the tone of the series of television ""Jesse Stone"" movies has become much darker, with star Tom Selleck, particularly in the last installment, ""Thin Ice"", appearing to be losing the battle with his personal demons...well, the latest film, ""Jesse Stone: No Remorse"" is still dark, but I actually found it more upbeat, despite a series of obstacles that would test Job's patience!On suspension from the Paradise Police Department (a carry-over from ""Thin Ice""), Chief Jesse Stone (Selleck) is downing a fair amount of Scotch (to the disapproving gaze of his dog, Reggie...which Jesse insists isn't 'his' dog, even after sharing his home for 3 1/2 years!) His ex-wife is still trying to maintain a phone relationship, forcing him to rip his phone out of the wall (and break down and buy a cell phone). His Boston P.D. buddy, Commander Healy (Stephen McHattie) needs his help as a 'consultant', as a serial killer is on a spree; a convenience store killer in Paradise is overtaxing the community's tiny police force (Kathy Baker and Kohl Sudduth), with the City Council hoping the pair will fail in their investigation, so the entire department...including Chief Stone...can ALL be fired, and replaced! The ex-wife (Krista Allen) of the man who hired him, originally (Saul Rubinek), offers Stone her body, Officer Gammon (Baker) is facing a divorce, gangster Gino Fish (William Sadler) appears to have ties to the Boston murders, and long-suffering therapist Dr. Dix (William Devane) admits he hates fishing! A full plate for Jesse Stone, indeed...As with all the movies, a brilliant ensemble cast keeps things moving, and I cannot praise Tom Selleck, enough. His performance is restrained, yet intense (watch his body language and listen to his voice when he warns a young friend at a convenience store to be careful...simply brilliant acting!) There is more humor than in ""Thin Ice"", although it is dark and a bit sarcastic (understandable, given the circumstances). And the finale is positive (even if we don't get to see it all the way through...a new film, ""Jesse Stone: Innocents Lost"", has been filmed, so we can be pretty sure things will work out!)Another chapter of the Saga definitely worth owning!",5,"Another Dark but Rewarding Tom Selleck ""Stone"" TV Movie!",1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,2250,"['passing', 'author', 'Robert', 'B.', 'Parker', 'tone', 'series', 'television', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'movies', 'become', 'much', 'darker', 'star', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'particularly', 'last', 'installment', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'appearing', 'be', 'losing', 'battle', 'personal', 'demons', 'well', 'latest', 'film', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Remorse', 'still', 'dark', 'actually', 'found', 'more', 'upbeat', 'series', 'obstacles', 'would', 'test', 'Job', 'patience', 'suspension', 'Paradise', 'Police', 'Department', 'carry-over', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Selleck', 'downing', 'fair', 'amount', 'Scotch', 'disapproving', 'gaze', 'dog', 'Reggie', 'Jesse', ""n't"", ""'his"", 'dog', 'even', 'sharing', 'home', '3', '1/2', 'years', 'ex-wife', 'still', 'trying', 'maintain', 'phone', 'relationship', 'forcing', 'rip', 'phone', 'wall', 'break', 'down', 'buy', 'cell', 'phone', 'Boston', 'P.D', 'buddy', 'Commander', 'Healy', 'Stephen', 'McHattie', 'help', ""'consultant"", 'serial', 'killer', 'spree', 'convenience', 'store', 'killer', 'Paradise', 'overtaxing', 'community', 'tiny', 'police', 'force', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'Kohl', 'Sudduth', 'City', 'Council', 'hoping', 'pair', 'will', 'fail', 'investigation', 'entire', 'department', 'including', 'Chief', 'Stone', 'can', 'be', 'fired', 'replaced', 'ex-wife', 'Krista', 'Allen', 'man', 'who', 'hired', 'originally', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'Stone', 'body', 'Officer', 'Gammon', 'Baker', 'facing', 'divorce', 'gangster', 'Gino', 'Fish', 'William', 'Sadler', 'have', 'ties', 'Boston', 'murders', 'long-suffering', 'therapist', 'Dr.', 'Dix', 'William', 'Devane', 'fishing', 'full', 'plate', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'indeed', 'movies', 'brilliant', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'keeps', 'things', 'moving', 'can', 'not', 'praise', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'enough', 'performance', 'restrained', 'yet', 'intense', 'watch', 'body', 'language', 'listen', 'voice', 'when', 'young', 'friend', 'convenience', 'store', 'be', 'careful', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'more', 'humor', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'dark', 'bit', 'sarcastic', 'understandable', 'given', 'circumstances', 'finale', 'positive', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'way', 'new', 'film', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'Innocents', 'Lost', 'been', 'filmed', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'sure', 'things', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'chapter', 'Saga', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning']",N/A

1338551,A1V74MGUYUUFAK,B003ES5JJ2,"Bob ""seabgb""","[5, 10]","There might be some minor spoilers in here.First off, I'm a huge Selleck fan, and I'm an even bigger Parker fan. I've read them all, and I've seen all the Stone, made for TV features.By shear coincidence my Netflix arrival on Saturday was Jesse Stone: ThinIce, which I missed last year, and by another bit of coincidence I wasable to drive back from along road trip in time to see No Remorse last night.Robert Parker got a tribute reference on the reel but I'm wondering if hewould have approved the direction Selleck and Harmon have taken with hischaracters. If I'm not mistaken Thin Ice and No Remorse were written fortelevision based on characters created by Parker, whose last Stone novelwas Stone Cold in 2004. (I have since learned from a friend that Parker got to see No Remorse before he passed away. According to this friend, Parker approved and enjoyed the effort.)Clearly, Selleck and Harmon have had a long and prosperous relationshipwith Parker, and I can envision a real sympatico there. So take mycriticisms with a grain of salt, or two fingers of Johnny Walker Red,iykwim.Over the course of this novelization, Parker gave Stone one seriouslypathetic Jones for his crazy, mixed-up, slut of an ex-wife. I can'tremember which ones they were but I do remember throwing a couple of booksacross the room and yelling: ""For Chrissakes, Stone, GROW A PAIR!!!""However, the books didn't leave me with the overwhelming sense of dreadand despair imparted by the solemn, stoic, depressing expression Selleckwore for nearly four hours of my TV viewing Saturnday and Sunday. ""For Crissakes, Selleck, can't you just once curl your upper lip a little!!!!?????? Or how aboutpet your freakin' dog?""All of Parker's hero characters seem share one thing in common, anundeniable and completely trustworthy moral compass, which makes them alldog lovers. If Selleck doesn't touch his dog in the next entry of thisseries I am going to sick PETA on him.Seriously, there are a few things Selleck has done with the Stone character withwhich I am in complete disagreement. But, that's OK. I'm in it for thelong haul. I'll keep watching. I like Selleck, and I love Parker's characters.Granted, I was probably tired, but No Remorse seemed a little disjointed. Itdidn't have Parker's signature simplicity. I mean, the crime aspect, thedetective work, was very simple, but there was so much background andpersonal stuff going on it took me away from the story. Normally, when Parker tells a story, he does it as follows: 1. Something bad happens. 2. Parker's character is on the case. 3. Character goes from place to place and shakes some trees. 3. Some unrelated stuff happens in between that helps define the character. 4. Fruit finally falls out of the trees and Parker's character makes a fruit salad.This one was like: 1. Something happens. 2. Stone is on the case. 3. Thenhe's fired. 4. Then all this stuff happens that makes the characterconfusing. (He's this. He's that. He doesn't know how he feels. He'swicked sad. He gets a cell phone).5. More stuff happens that doesn't haveanything to do with the story. (Suffice it to say that nobody stays married for very long in Paradise.) 6.

My family had the date marked on the calender for weeks just to be sure we didn't miss it.Jesse Stone IS a dark character, so it naturally follows that what goes on in the series will be dark. But his interaction with the rest of the cast of characters is so great, and we all can see his developing fondness for Reggie. How could one NOT love Reggie? He loves Reggie but is afraid to let himself show it. Same with his other friendships. CURSE YOU, JEN!While I really like Kathy Baker, I also miss Molly's character. It would be nice to have them both back in some way. After all, the Paradise PD needs staff, right?Suitcase is a treasure. I also love the psychiatrist(although I get the urge to break out an inhaler while watching his scenes) and Capt. Healy. Everyone in the show is great. A wonderful cast of character actors.

In the first few in the series we were getting to know the main character and some of the regular secondary ones. The series played well and the stories were well developed. However, there are only so many ways to present an alcoholic police officer without developing his personality more thoroughly. So it became a repeat of scenes with slightly different story lines -- an independent depressed police chief, who drinks Johnnie Walker Red nearly every night, is the hero protector of the weak and victimized with the help and support of a small group of folks who really love and appreciate him for his unseen finer qualities.  A drunk who encounters new attractive female characters in the process of carrrying out his duties who seem to universally want him as a lover.  Interesting connections the first few times, but the formula becomes old by this point. Also, &#34;No Remorse&#34; appears to add more of the action film flavor (scenes of shootings, blood spattering and flowing abundantly); whereas the first several were developing the characters and their relationships.

This film is based on one of his Jesse Stone books, and it captures the spice of Parker's writing as much as films can do so. The language is Parker's and this makes it great. It lacks the humor that is always in Parker's speech and the sly references to literature, both of which are also Parker trademarks, but this loss, although large, does not detract from the film or from the acting in it.There are two series of crimes in this tale. Jesse has been suspended without pay from serving as Paradise's Police Chief. He is hired by the State Police to consult on solving several homicides.

Jesse is pretty depressed and drinking a lot, but he does finally decide talking to his ex-wife Jen is a bad idea.Things start to look up when Healey of the state police invites Jesse to consult on an apparent serial killer case in Boston and there's been a rash of convenience store robberies in Paradise that Rose and Acting Police Chief Suitcase feel inadequate to cope with.  Since Jesse also spends a lot of time with his psychiatrist trying to figure out why he can't give his dog affection, his schedule fills up fast.  He also needs to learn how to use a cell phone since there was an, ah, unfortunate accident with his land line.  Because of the interdiction on Jesse's communication with Suitcase and Rose, the cell phone becomes a plot point and the cloak and dagger element just misses being comic.Jesse doggedly pursues the serial killer who seems to have a connection with the boxing promoter Gino Fish, and aids Rose and Suitcase, who need Jesse's help in identifying the perpetrator of the convenience store robberies from security tapes.  The entire Paradise police department in a superb display of teamwork catches the convenience store perp. The serial killer case is wrapped up in the last few minutes of the movie in an incredible twist that left me saying, `Huh?'With No Remorse, the movie character of Jesse Stone diverges irrevocably from that of the late lamented Robert Parker's books.  He's more angst-ridden and struggles in ways the book Jesse doesn't.  No Remorse, co-written by Tom Selleck, is dark. All the characters are having major problems both on and off the job to the point that it's almost painful to watch.  The delightful  repartee that's always been a feature of the Jesse Stone movies is much heavier handed and honestly, the movie could use some comic relief in addition to Jesse's problems with his cell phone.  Several plot threads were left dangling but I read there will be at least one more Jesse Stone movie, so perhaps things will be resolved.Three and a half stars rounded up to four.

I've always liked Selleck and think this is his best role ever. Having said all that, the 6th movie in the series is a huge let down from the previous 5 ,in my view. First without spoiling anything a character from one of the previous films returns in this one on parole after comitting a crime that should have kept them in prison for 10 years at least! Then, their's Tom Selleck spending most of the movie disheveled, depressed, bordering on 'whimpy' cause he's on administrative leave from his job as Chief of Paradise PD. In the first 5 films he's the perfect balance of tough, independent, caring, but flawed while here he's almost painful to watch having totally lost his 'mojo'. In addition the other two cops in Paradise played by Kathy Baker (the series really misses Viola Davis by the way) and Kohl Suddeth have lost the 'grit' they had in the previous films too.This installment isn't a total loss. The great William Sadler is back as gangster 'Gino Fish' and when Tom Selleck goes to him to investigate a crime/murder their interaction is the best part of the film. The case with Gino concludes with an ending that is shocking--but satifying. The other story thread about a crime closer to Paradise is just 'ok' and needed more work.And one final thing; I found the ending totally unsatifying apart from the fact that they obviously can't leave the series as it is so at least one more Jesse Stone would have to be coming I would imagine. Will I watch another film if they make one? Absolutely! This was a subpar effort but overall this series is one of my very favorite ""cop shows, for grown-ups"" as I like to call it.",3,A big let down,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",2010,1727,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'having', 'watched', 'previous', '5', 'Jesses', 'Stone', 'movies', 'several', 'times', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Selleck', 'think', 'best', 'role', 'ever', 'Having', 'said', '6th', 'movie', 'series', 'huge', 'let', 'previous', '5', 'view', 'First', 'spoiling', 'anything', 'character', 'one', 'previous', 'films', 'returns', 'one', 'parole', 'comitting', 'crime', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'prison', '10', 'years', 'least', 'Then', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'spending', 'most', 'movie', 'disheveled', 'depressed', 'bordering', ""'whimpy"", 'cause', 'administrative', 'leave', 'job', 'Chief', 'Paradise', 'PD', 'first', '5', 'films', 'perfect', 'balance', 'tough', 'independent', 'caring', 'flawed', 'here', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'having', 'totally', 'lost', ""'mojo"", 'addition', 'other', 'two', 'cops', 'Paradise', 'played', 'Kathy', 'Baker', 'series', 'really', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'way', 'Kohl', 'Suddeth', 'have', 'lost', ""'grit"", 'had', 'previous', 'films', 'too.This', 'installment', ""n't"", 'total', 'loss', 'great', 'William', 'Sadler', 'back', 'gangster', ""'Gino"", 'Fish', 'when', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'investigate', 'crime/murder', 'interaction', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'case', 'Gino', 'concludes', 'ending', 'shocking', 'satifying', 'other', 'story', 'thread', 'crime', 'closer', 'Paradise', 'just', ""'ok"", 'needed', 'more', 'work.And', 'one', 'final', 'thing', 'found', 'ending', 'totally', 'unsatifying', 'apart', 'fact', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'series', 'so', 'least', 'one', 'more', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'coming', 'would', 'imagine', 'Will', 'watch', 'film', 'make', 'one', 'Absolutely', 'was', 'subpar', 'effort', 'overall', 'series', 'one', 'very', 'favorite', 'cop', 'shows', 'grown-ups', 'like', 'call']",N/A

1338630,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,B003ES5JJ2,moviemusicbuff,"[6, 6]","I've read a number of the reviews of this movie.  Many of the reviewers stated that this one featured a darker Jesse Stone.  There's a good reason for that, which I will comment on later in this review.  I'm a big fan of the Jesse Stone movie series, and I particularly liked the first four in the series (Stone Cold, Death in Paradise, Night Passage, and Sea Change).In this latest installment, Jesse Stone (even while he is officially suspended by the Town Council of Paradise) helps his friend Healey (Captain of the Boston Homicide Department) and the Paradise Police Department to solve a series of mysterious killings in Paradise.  Capt. Healey hires Jesse as a consultant to get his ""coply intuition"" in an effort to find clues to solve the case;  meanwhile, the overworked and undermanned Paradise PD, represented by Rose and Suitcase, also seek Jesse's help ""unofficially."" These killings seem to be linked to the mob, but there are no definite clues.  Meanwhile, there is sub-plot with Jesse's struggles with how to operate his cell-phone -- everyone's trying to leave messages for him.I liked ""No Remorse"" because it offers a deeper inside look into Jesse Stone's struggles, personality, and relationships.  He has deeper interactions with people like Rose (the assistant to the Chief), Suitcase (now the Temp Chief), Healey (the Boston Homicide Chief), and his conversations with the crime boss Gino Fish and his assistant are more extensive.There were some comical moments in this film.  His conversations with Hastings (the former town council boss he put away in Night Passage) were amusing.  Hastings is now a used car salesman and he likes to tell Jesse ""I'm very fond of you, Jesse"", to which Jesse replies, ""Whenever you tell me that, bad things happen!""  Jesse also has an amusing and awkward chat with a female nun over dinner.  Meanwhile, Jesse also tries to reach out and show affection to his dog as advised by his therapist.  These scenes helped to lighten up the mood.If Jesse Stone seems ""darker"" in ""No Remorse"",it is because he is depressed & devastated by the official suspension of being the Chief.  Jesse Stone loved his job and he was so gifted in solving difficult cases. He was born to be the Police Chief in Paradise and he did a brilliant job.  Tom Selleck and Michael Brandman did a masterful job of writing the original script to this entry;  they were sensitive to what was happening with Jesse Stone's character.  It would make sense that Jesse would not have the same light-hearted banter that characterized the first four series (because he's not the Chief anymore, and he's depressed).  The script gave us more of a personal look into Jesse Stone.  We also get a better glimpse of his relationships with people.  We see his affection for his former co-workers (Rose and Suitcase) in the Paradise Police Department, his care for the girl Emily who works at the convenience store, and his friendship with Healey, who helps him out by hiring him as his consultant.  We also hear a richer dialogue with Jesse's shrink; one of his sessions proves to be very significant in helping Jesse find the right clues in the case.I thought ""No Remorse"" was much more satisfying and suspenseful than the depressing and dismal ""Thin Ice.""  I enjoyed the rich character development, the deeper personal look at Jesse Stone, and the suspenseful story.  What is sadly missing in this DVD are any special features:  there are no interviews, no featurettes, and no commentary (hence the deletion of a star). Now, that's dark and depressing!!",4,A very satisfying entry in the Jesse Stone series,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",2010,3563,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'number', 'reviews', 'movie', 'Many', 'reviewers', 'stated', 'one', 'featured', 'darker', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'good', 'reason', 'will', 'comment', 'later', 'review', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'movie', 'series', 'particularly', 'liked', 'first', 'four', 'series', 'Stone', 'Cold', 'Death', 'Paradise', 'Night', 'Passage', 'Sea', 'Change', '.In', 'latest', 'installment', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'even', 'officially', 'suspended', 'Town', 'Council', 'Paradise', 'friend', 'Healey', 'Captain', 'Boston', 'Homicide', 'Department', 'Paradise', 'Police', 'Department', 'solve', 'series', 'mysterious', 'killings', 'Paradise', 'Capt', 'Healey', 'Jesse', 'consultant', 'get', 'coply', 'intuition', 'effort', 'find', 'clues', 'solve', 'case', 'meanwhile', 'overworked', 'undermanned', 'Paradise', 'PD', 'represented', 'Rose', 'Suitcase', 'also', 'seek', 'Jesse', 'help', 'unofficially', 'killings', 'seem', 'be', 'linked', 'mob', 'are', 'definite', 'clues', 'Meanwhile', 'sub-plot', 'Jesse', 'struggles', 'how', 'operate', 'cell-phone', 'everyone', 'trying', 'leave', 'messages', 'him.I', 'liked', 'Remorse', 'deeper', 'inside', 'look', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'struggles', 'personality', 'relationships', 'deeper', 'interactions', 'people', 'Rose', 'assistant', 'Chief', 'Suitcase', 'now', 'Temp', 'Chief', 'Healey', 'Boston', 'Homicide', 'Chief', 'conversations', 'crime', 'boss', 'Gino', 'Fish', 'assistant', 'are', 'more', 'extensive.There', 'were', 'comical', 'moments', 'film', 'conversations', 'Hastings', 'former', 'town', 'council', 'put', 'away', 'Night', 'Passage', 'were', 'amusing', 'Hastings', 'now', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'tell', 'Jesse', ""'m"", 'very', 'fond', 'Jesse', 'Jesse', 'replies', 'Whenever', 'tell', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'Jesse', 'also', 'amusing', 'awkward', 'chat', 'female', 'nun', 'dinner', 'Meanwhile', 'Jesse', 'also', 'reach', 'out', 'show', 'affection', 'dog', 'advised', 'therapist', 'scenes', 'helped', 'lighten', 'up', 'mood.If', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'darker', 'Remorse', 'depressed', 'devastated', 'official', 'suspension', 'being', 'Chief', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'loved', 'job', 'was', 'so', 'gifted', 'solving', 'difficult', 'cases', 'was', 'born', 'be', 'Police', 'Chief', 'Paradise', 'did', 'brilliant', 'job', 'Tom', 'Selleck', 'Michael', 'Brandman', 'did', 'masterful', 'job', 'writing', 'original', 'script', 'entry', 'were', 'sensitive', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'character', 'would', 'make', 'sense', 'Jesse', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'light-hearted', 'banter', 'characterized', 'first', 'four', 'series', 'not', 'Chief', 'anymore', 'depressed', 'script', 'gave', 'more', 'personal', 'look', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'also', 'get', 'better', 'glimpse', 'relationships', 'people', 'see', 'affection', 'former', 'co-workers', 'Rose', 'Suitcase', 'Paradise', 'Police', 'Department', 'care', 'girl', 'Emily', 'who', 'convenience', 'store', 'friendship', 'Healey', 'who', 'out', 'hiring', 'consultant', 'also', 'hear', 'richer', 'dialogue', 'Jesse', 'shrink', 'one', 'sessions', 'be', 'very', 'significant', 'helping', 'Jesse', 'find', 'right', 'clues', 'case.I', 'thought', 'Remorse', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'satisfying', 'suspenseful', 'depressing', 'dismal', 'Thin', 'Ice', 'enjoyed', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'deeper', 'personal', 'look', 'Jesse', 'Stone', 'suspenseful', 'story', 'What', 'sadly', 'missing', 'DVD', 'are', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'interviews', 'featurettes', 'commentary', 'hence', 'deletion', 'star', 'Now', 'dark', 'depressing']",N/A

He has been suspended from his job as Police Chief in Paradise, and has been called by his friend Healey in Boston to assist in finding a serial killer. This leads to all sorts of problems for friends and enemies in the Boston area.In the meantime, his colleagues back in Paradise must look for the person or persons responsible for the thievery at some gas stations. Rose played by Kathy Baker is just the best. She knows how to play detective, and even though, at times she has to call Stone for advice, she does her job. Luther, played by Kohl Sudduth finds his bearings and is turning into a competent policeman.  William Devane, who plays Stone's psychiatrist, is doing his best to attempt to limit the amount if alcohol Stone consumes, but at times he has no control, and he admits it. Saul, a used car salesman is newly released from prison and helps Stone with contacts.Again, much time is spent on looking at Stone's life and his misery. Even his dog is tired of Stone's drinking. Too much time is consumed with Stone's emotional issues, and not enough time on the serial killer.

1338656,A2TBN90L5KP085,B003ES5JJ2,Steven Zoraster,"[0, 3]","Good things first: I found parts fun because it was ""old home"" week.  All - living - characters from previous episodes make an appearance.  Often, they sparked good memories. I did like Hathaway, now used car dealer; Rose, experiencing family problems; Healy, recovering from his wounds from the last movie, and the shrink Dix, still asking questions.  And I liked the laid back scenery of Paradise. But too often characters repeat boring lines, ""It's out there, you just need...."", or, like Cissy or the Nun, add nothing to the story.  Also, I am tired of Jen - as, to his credit, is Jesse. Regarding Jen, and the other old characters, this show has Jesse reaching out to people for the first time.  It's done with a bit of humor.  So, possibly the show should have been titled ""Jesse Stone, Redemption"".Bad things second: Jesse is getting old to excite so much the female attention.  And the two unrelated crime sprees Jesse must solve are handled badly.  The writers spent too little time on these plots.  That made me unhappy, because minor changes at little cost could have made the conclusions more satisfying. I do not understand how, near the end, Jesse got to the ongoing crime scene in Paradise. (""Coply intuition"" in place of a dead zone cell phone?) Or, why he told Geno Fish about Jesse's Boston murder suspect, unless he wanted Geno to have him killed. Which, when it happened, was implied to surprise Jesse.  Regarding this second case, it would have been easy to have Rose, Suitcase, or Jesse himself, follow the suspect after that confrontation with Jesse, since Jesse must have known that doing so might provide conclusive proof of guilt.  We did not even need to see the tail. Just have a phone call to Jesse, after which he can tell Healy where to search for the evidence.  Adding all of a few thousand dollars to the total cost of producing the movie?Given how they brought everyone back, I thought, ""This must be the final episode"", but at the end the movie implied more to come. Now that everyone has Jesse's phone number and he is no longer talking to Jen, that may imply a better luck next time.
