There he meets a veteran who belonged to a ultra secret and special unit - The new world army! US military trained individuals with special skills like, yes, killing goats with a stare, among much other stuff as preposterous.We have a dual quest here: The reporter Bob Wilton to prove his worth and Lyn Cassady to make up for using is powers for evil - the Dark side - and killing a goat (and as everybody knows ""No goats no glory"").With so many films with special military units or agents with weird capacities like GI Joes, James Bonds, which can do anything it's difficult for many viewers to realize that this isn't one of those films. This is supposed to be the ""real world""! Not an action flick. That is the fun of it. The military are usually the most serious and logical persons, they rarely tolerate nonsense; and to watch a country like USA invest considerable resources to create Jedi's it's really funny. Usually the trick to really appreciate action or fantasy movies is to concentrate only in the inner logic of the movie, suspend disbelief...here is the opposite.

It examines the use of the theme tune to Barney & Friends on Iraqi prisoners-of-war, the smuggling of a hundred de-bleated goats into the Special Forces command center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and the connection between the U.S. military and the mass-suicide of members of the Heaven's Gate cult in San Diego.",5,Based on true story.,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,961,"['Based', 'book', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', '2004', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'exploration', 'New', 'Age', 'concepts', 'potential', 'military', 'applications', 'paranormal', 'title', 'refers', 'attempts', 'kill', 'goats', 'staring', 'Research', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'part', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'also', 'documentary', 'filmmaker', 'John', 'Sergeant.The', 'book', 'examines', 'connections', 'military', 'programs', 'psychological', 'techniques', 'being', 'used', 'interrogation', 'War', 'Terror', 'book', 'evolution', 'covert', 'activities', 'previous', 'three', 'decades', 'how', 'persisted', 'U.S', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'Iraq', 'War', 'use', 'theme', 'tune', 'Barney', 'Friends', 'Iraqi', 'prisoners-of-war', 'smuggling', 'hundred', 'de-bleated', 'goats', 'Special', 'Forces', 'command', 'center', 'Fort', 'Bragg', 'North', 'Carolina', 'connection', 'U.S.', 'military', 'mass-suicide', 'members', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'cult', 'San', 'Diego']",N/A
1292911,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,B002VECMAE,Craig MACKINNON,"[0, 0]","This film has everything going for it - some of the best actors in the business (especially George Clooney and Ewan McGregor, but also Jeff Bridges in ""Dude"" mode for most of the film), a nifty idea, and the opportunity for wicked satire while posing as a slapstick comedy.  Although parts of the film deliver, overall it will likely fade from memory as a distant also-ran to Dr. Strangelove and M*A*S*H in the war-satire department.It didn't have to be this way.  The original story/book is about a true research initiative by the army (in the early 1980s) to study the feasibility of using psychic powers to create a unit of psychic warriors (""Jedi"") who defeat their enemies with the power of the mind (and thus negating the need to actually fight and kill).  This story is transplanted into a journey into Iraq by a former member of the unit (Lyn, played by Clooney) and a journalist hunting for the story (Bob, played by McGregor).  It turns out (according to the film, at least) that the only lasting legacy of the Jedi program was the development of new torture devices to break the will of captured enemies without using physical force.  In one particularly dark sequence, the ""Barney music"" torture method of constantly blasting repetative children's songs at prisoners is shown.  But by far the best and most memorable part of the film is the extended sequence where Bob, Lyn, and an Iraqi are kidnapped by local bandits, and eventually end up in the middle of a shootout between the private armies of two American contractors.Thus, all the elements are there for a top-notch satire.  Unfortunately, the script takes the idea of the Jedi's powers too seriously (in my opinion) and thus concentrates too long on the flashback sequences.  Even this method could have worked, if the story had been one of redemption for Col. Bill Django (Bridges) - who was dishonourably discharged from a unit charged with finding non-violent means to resolve conflict but who eventually applied his knowledge to help develop torture methods.  But Jeff Bridges is not as big a star as Clooney and McGregor, so the opportunity is lost.There are some extras on the DVD, the most interesting is the audio commentary by the author of the original book.  He provides a lot of added background information (acknowledging that in a film, multiple people are often condensed into one character).  But overall the extras are similar to the film, fun while they last but ultimately forgettable.

As did I, one could very easily mistake the point of the film to be anti-American or anti-Military. DON'T. After a joyous second viewing, I was pleased to discover that I was wrong. The film is a ridiculous satire. If anything, it's poking fun at the book on which it's based.George Clooney has delivered yet another outstanding performance in one of three of 2009's best films. I like the man more and more with everything I see him do. All three of his films from `09 (Up in the Air, Fantastic Mr. Fox and of course this one) were hilarious comedies; but they differ from one another in vast proportions. If you haven't, make an effort to see them all!Here Clooney plays my favorite character in the film, Lyn Cassady. Lyn honestly believes with all his heart that he has psychic powers and capabilities to do the unthinkable on numerous levels. This is all explained to us and to Ewan McGregor's character, Bob Wilton, early on in a hotel room in Kuwait back in 2003.Bob is a reporter who has just been left by his wife for his one-armed editor. He flees to Kuwait with high hopes of crossing the border into Iraq after the war has just kicked off, for a chance at a big story. Lyn is his golden ticket. After hearing about Lyn via an even nuttier source, (if that's even possible), Bob is ecstatic when he runs into Lyn. Bob's fruit-loop of a source explained that he and Lyn had been trained to kill animals via staring at them for prolonged periods of time. The United States Army had trained them to do so, and Lyn Cassady was the best there ever was at performing this preposterous endeavor.In addition to killing animals with hours on end of staring, Lyn explains that he was a member of `The New Earth Army.' According to the book and the audio commentaries on the DVD, there is some truth to this group existing, although it was in fact titled something slightly less interesting. Mainly other than this, and a few of the conversations that take place between Bob and Lyn being portrayed word for word; most of the film is strictly Hollywood's innovative twist on the truth.Lyn further explains to Bob, that while enrolled in The New Earth Army, he was also trained how to interrupt someone's thought pattern; telekinetically of course.The film takes Bob, and cleverly makes that character us as audience members. More than anything else, it's out of sheer bewildered curiosity that Bob wants to tag along with Lyn, into Iraq. Lyn allows him to do so, after he sees some of the `Jedi' in Bob. The Jedi is what those of The New Earth Army would often refer to themselves as. The term Jedi as you may recall, stems from the Star Wars franchise, which evidently Bob has never seen, as Ewan McGregor appeared in the first three episodes. Contrary to popular belief, this was coincidental according to the filmmakers. But it provides us with a warm laugh when we see the scene, nonetheless.There is a segment in the film that will cause you to uncontrollably fill your shoes with urine, due to a fit of insane laughter. Clooney's facial expressions are a riot, as he attempts to `cloud burst' some clouds while driving. Bob stares at him wide eyed, as he explains that by using his mind, he can cause clouds to burst into bits of clouds. One such cloud just so happens to do so and `there you have it', says Clooney's expression. The purpose of this technique is never revealed by Lyn.One of the things that makes the film so gut-wrenchingly funny, is that Lyn is often so satisfied that he has proven his powers to  Bob, when he has in fact done no such thing. For instance, there is a scene where he attempts to show Bob that he can get inside his head and mentally disarm Bob from causing harm to him. He physically knocks Bob down and then triumphantly says, ""See? I barely moved. Physics wise not much going on here. It's the psychic energy that's important."" If you have ever met someone like Lyn, the film will be an entertaining reminder of such an exhilaratingly bizarre encounter.The third act has our adventures with Bob and Lyn, eventually lead to interactions with two more appreciated characters that we hear much about and see in a few flashbacks throughout the film. Jeff Bridges plays the hippie-ish originator of The New Earth Army, Bill Django; and Kevin Spacey is the envy-fuelled villain, as Larry Hooper. Somehow, things get even more hysterical and out of control when these two outlandish beings are thrown into the mix. Hallucinogenic drugs, tanks, childish revenge, semi-automatic rifles, an act of heroic courage, and helicopters are involved, and it couldn't have been any more amusing.Bob's character is based on the writer of the book, Jon Ronson. Having listened to this man on one of the commentary tracks, I can tell you that much like his characters; he's a little out there to say the least. The filmmakers obviously didn't take him too seriously either, as they miss-spelled his name on the end credits, which he points out at the end of the commentary track. Another appealing element to the film is the fact that Jon Ronson doesn't seem to be aware that the film is basically a mockery of his book. At least it was in my eyes.There are several more Jedi `powers' that I didn't mention; a major one in particular that I'll leave for you to find. Just don't take the ending to mean that Bob literally performs it.",5,The Men Who Stare at Goats Review,1270944000,"04 11, 2010",2010,5838,"['MEN', 'WHO', 'STARE', 'AT', 'GOATSSTARRING', 'Ewan',

The Men Who Stare at Goats falls under the truth is stranger than fiction category as it presents a story populated by eccentric characters and tall tales, some of which might be true. Regardless, it is an entertaining film with a wonderfully oddball sense of humor. Don't be put off by the setting. Although it takes place in Iraq, The Men Who Stare at Goats is not weighed down by the baggage of this war.There is an audio commentary by the film's director Grant Heslov. He points out certain characters that are composites but is quick to explain that what they say comes from Jon Ronson's bookThe Men Who Stare at Goats. He sometimes spends too much time telling us where certain scenes were shot which gets tiresome pretty fast. Heslov's focus is mostly on the nuts and bolts of filmmaking but done in a fairly dry and uninteresting way.Also included is a commentary by the book's author Jon Ronson. He points out the scenes that are based on real incidents and talks about meeting the actual people that the characters are based on. He also explains who the composite characters are and tells all sorts of fascinating anecdotes.

The film is based around a supposedly true plot: ""psychic warriors"" trained to fight terrorists, led by a hippie soldier, attacked by an arrogant Army officer, and infiltrated by a bored investigative reporter and a former psychic soldier.  It makes for a great story, and overall, GOATS succeeds brilliantly; it is a delightful, at times dark film (the last 20 minutes or so get so dark, you'll wish the whole film had been this gutsy) that proposes a lot of questions, and doesn't bother answering them (like any good satire should).However, something's lacking.  Peter Straughan's script isn't up to par; and Grant Heslov's directing seems at times undecided.  The acting is fine--Clooney is understated; Bridges is himself; Spacey is delightfully off-kilter; and watching McGregor deadpan the question ""What's a Jedi?"" is just good geeky fun--but the film itself doesn't live up to the cast's combined talents.  The end result is a film that's certainly an enjoyable watch, even laugh-out-loud funny in spots (though it's overall a subtle comedy; this isn't slapstick, it's satire), but doesn't have the lasting effect something with this weight should.  The ending is ultimately a let-down; a lot of build up for very little.  That's not to say the movie isn't worth your time; if you enjoy intellectual comedies, you'll definitely want to check it out.  However, unlike others of the genre--DR. STRANGELOVE comes to mind, though it's probably unfair to compare any war satire to Kubrick's masterpiece--THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS doesn't stay with you once you're done watching.  And that is a damn shame, because a film with this great a cast, and this interesting a premise, deserves--almost necessitates--a lasting presence.

1292920,A2Q42ON9CEHR4O,B002VECMAE,David R. Eastwood,"[1, 1]","Whenever we watch movies or read stories, we usually assume that the component parts were put together with a reasonably clear purpose that we'll be able to figure out and then evaluate. If our interpretation differs from another person's, sometimes we will argue for or against a conclusion by pointing to specific bits of ""internal evidence"" or by saying some general premise is or isn't relevant to the case.But sometimes, of course, we can be totally wrong: some movies and stories just do NOT have any unified purpose.Sometimes their components are basically a bunch of things that are merely close to each other; they were pulled together by somebody who happened to think they all were ""interesting,"" like a little kid's collection of colorful clam shells and bottle caps.And just MAYBE that is all the unity this film has.Everyone watching THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS will be aware there is an alternating ""double perspective"" throughout most of it: there is (A) ""the action of the present"" (which slowly inches forward chronologically), involving an ineffectual reporter (Ewan McGregor) and a supposedly psychic so-called Jedi (George Clooney), and there is (B) ""the action of the past"" (shown in a large number of randomly sequenced flashbacks), involving the original so-called psychic Jedis (Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, etc.). Almost any viewer--after watching (A) and (B) zigzagging for more than an hour--would reasonably expect that this film would end with some meaningful link-up between (A) and (B).While I was watching this film, I recalled how gullible people were about New Age psychic phenomena during the '50s, '60s, and '70s and also how dozens of times during my own experiences in the U.S. Army (in the '60s) some wonderful new weapon or strategy would suddenly appear, be hyped by the command for a few months, and then suddenly drop out of sight. To me, as the film approached its end, it SEEMED to be a military-industrial-political satire--designed to show us how one more stupid idea (top-secret psychic warriors) had been funded by our government and then been turned into a big money-making scam by Kevin Spacey's unscrupulous character, who is working for one of the unscrupulous corporations that live off our country's huge ""defense"" budgets.And yet, on second thought . . . such an interpretation is undercut by the FUZZY FOCUS and LACK OF EMPHASIS the scam gets during the period when Kevin Spacey finally is in the present-time action--and then by the LACK OF AWARENESS the ineffectual reporter has about the scam when he writes and discusses his expos&eacute; story in the film's closing scene.Perhaps, therefore, it is relevant to mention one of the Bonus Features on the DVD that shows Peter Straughan, the author of the screenplay, telling HOW he went to work. He took (he says) Jon Ronson's book THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS and carefully marked all the weird passages that he wanted to be sure to include in the film--and THEN he tried to invent a new plot that would somehow string them together.As I said earlier, just MAYBE all the unity the episodes of this film have--is being lumped together like a kid's collection of bottle caps and clam shells.But even if this is so, most of the episodes really ARE very funny--and a few of them are very thought provoking.",4,FUNNY--BUT LESS THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS,1293840000,"01 1, 2011",2011,3317,"['watch', 'movies', 'read', 'stories', 'usually', 'assume', 'component', 'parts', 'were', 'put', 'together', 'reasonably', 'clear', 'purpose', ""'ll"", 'be', 'able', 'figure', 'out', 'then', 'evaluate', 'interpretation', 'differs', 'person', 'sometimes', 'will', 'argue', 'conclusion', 'pointing', 'specific', 'bits', 'internal', 'evidence', 'saying', 'general', 'premise', ""n't"", 'relevant', 'case.But', 'sometimes', 'course', 'can', 'be', 'totally', 'wrong', 'movies', 'stories', 'just', 'do', 'NOT', 'have', 'unified', 'purpose.Sometimes', 'components', 'are', 'basically', 'bunch', 'things', 'are', 'merely', 'close', 'other', 'were', 'pulled', 'together', 'somebody', 'who', 'happened', 'think', 'were', 'interesting', 'little', 'kid', 'collection', 'colorful', 'clam', 'shells', 'bottle', 'caps.And', 'just', 'MAYBE', 'unity', 'film', 'has.Everyone', 'watching', 'THE', 'MEN', 'WHO', 'STARE', 'AT', 'GOATS', 'will', 'be', 'aware', 'alternating', 'double', 'perspective', 'most', 'A', 'action', 'present', 'slowly', 'forward', 'chronologically', 'involving', 'ineffectual', 'reporter', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'supposedly', 'psychic', 'so-called', 'Jedi', 'George', 'Clooney', 'B', 'action', 'past', 'shown', 'large', 'number', 'randomly', 'sequenced', 'flashbacks', 'involving', 'original', 'so-called', 'psychic', 'Jedis', 'Clooney', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'etc.', 'viewer', 'watching', 'B', 'zigzagging', 'more', 'hour', 'would', 'reasonably', 'expect', 'film', 'would', 'end', 'meaningful', 'link-up', 'A', 'B', '.While', 'was', 'watching', 'film', 'recalled', 'how', 'gullible', 'people', 'were', 'New', 'Age', 'psychic', 'phenomena', ""'50s"", ""'60s"", ""'70s"", 'also', 'how', 'dozens', 'times', 'own', 'experiences', 'U.S.', 'Army', ""'60s"", 'wonderful', 'new', 'weapon', 'strategy', 'would', 'suddenly', 'appear', 'be', 'hyped', 'command', 'few', 'months', 'then', 'suddenly', 'sight', 'film', 'approached', 'end', 'SEEMED', 'be', 'military-industrial-political', 'satire', 'designed', 'show', 'how', 'one', 'more', 'stupid', 'idea', 'top-secret', 'psychic', 'warriors', 'had', 'been', 'funded', 'government', 'then', 'been', 'turned', 'big', 'money-making', 'scam', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'unscrupulous', 'character', 'who', 'working', 'one', 'unscrupulous', 'corporations', 'live', 'country', 'huge', 'defense', 'budgets.And', 'yet', 'second', 'thought', 'such', 'interpretation', 'undercut', 'FUZZY', 'FOCUS', 'LACK', 'OF', 'EMPHASIS', 'scam', 'period', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'finally', 'present-time', 'action', 'then', 'LACK', 'OF', 'AWARENESS', 'ineffectual', 'reporter', 'scam', 'when', 'expos', 'eacute', 'story', 'film', 'closing', 'scene.Perhaps', 'therefore', 'relevant', 'mention', 'one', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'DVD', 'Peter', 'Straughan', 'author', 'screenplay', 'telling', 'HOW', 'went', 'work', 'took', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'book', 'THE', 'MEN', 'WHO', 'STARE', 'AT', 'GOATS', 'carefully', 'marked', 'weird', 'passages', 'wanted', 'be', 'sure', 'include', 'film', 'THEN', 'tried', 'invent', 'new', 'plot', 'would', 'somehow', 'string', 'together.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'just', 'MAYBE', 'unity', 'episodes', 'film', 'have', 'being', 'lumped', 'together', 'kid', 'collection', 'bottle', 'caps', 'clam', 'shells.But', 'even', 'so', 'most', 'episodes', 'really', 'ARE', 'very', 'funny', 'few', 'are', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking']",N/A

1292923,A2FEJIORC1MBG3,B002VECMAE,D. Hartley,"[2, 2]","So what do you get when you cross ""Ishtar"" with ""Catch-22""?  Perhaps you would get something along the lines of ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"", the first genuine goofball farce that anyone has managed to squeeze out utilizing the generally unfunny Iraq War, Mark II as a backdrop. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is a matter of personal taste.Ewan McGregor stars as Bob Wilton, a recently cuckolded Michigan newspaper reporter who, desperate to break out of his self-pitying reverie, decides on a whim to become a freelancing Iraq War journalist (circa 2003). As he tarries in Kuwait City, uncertain about how to actually go about getting himself into Iraq (he hadn't quite thought that part through before heading overseas) he comes across a mysterious, intriguing fellow named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) who ""happens"" to be heading that way. Initially playing it coy and denying that he is any kind of spook (in spite of veritably oozing Eau de Black Ops), Cassady does a 360 and opens up to Wilton, spinning him quite a wild narrative.Before he knows it, the reporter is tagging along with Cassady on his nebulous ""mission"", too gob smacked by tales of top-secret U.S. military programs involving the development of ""psychic warriors"" who liken themselves to Jedi knights, devoted to honing their mastery of various psychokinetic arts, to realize that he could be heading into the middle of the Iraqi desert with a man who is completely delusional and dangerously unhinged (it's sort of like a Hope and Crosby ""on the road"" flick-except with insurgents and IEDs).The fact that Ewan McGregor was the young Obi-Wan in the Star Wars prequels is not lost on the filmmakers, who provide him with opportunity for (perhaps too much) self-referential spoofing reminiscent of Ryan O'Neal's classic deadpan in ""What's Up, Doc?"" (when he responds to Barbara Streisand's ""Love Story"" quote, ""Love means never having to say you're sorry"" with ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard""). Jeff Bridges (hamming it big time up as Cassady's mentor) seems to be doing a nod or two to the Ghost of Lebowski Past; and Clooney's character definitely vibes the CIA operative that he played in ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"". Speaking of hams, Kevin Spacey is also on hand, playing a weaselly character as only he can.There is some unevenness in the film's tone, but with a dream cast, who are all obviously having such a great time, it's pretty easy to enjoy the ride (I mean, c'mon-Bridges, Clooney, Spacey, AND a gifted ""fainting goat"" who knows how to pick up his cues? It all adds up to black comedy gold, my friend). In fact, the film is kind of a throwback to a certain style of quirky, unfettered, freewheeling satire that pervaded the mid-to-late 60s; totally-blown fare like ""The Magic Christian"", ""Skidoo"", ""Candy"" and ""The Loved One"".  The film is directed by Grant Heslove (Clooney's partner in their Smokehouse Pictures production company)  and written by Peter Straughn, who adapted from Jon Ronson's, uh, ""non-fiction"" book (all you have to do is tell the truth, and no one will believe you). BTW- There are two songs you will not be able to get out of your head for days: Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"", and the theme from Barney the Dinosaur's TV show.

1292925,A1E6JS6C205VZD,B002VECMAE,Dr. Laurence Raw,"[0, 0]","THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS has an intriguing premise - that there exist a group of men within the US Army who succeed in persuading their opponents to down their weapons through auto-suggestion, or better still, sheer power of will.  The group is led by Jeff Bridges, who adopts a New Age approach to training them; Kevin Spacey is his rival, who ultimately supersedes him.  The two central characters, played by Ewan McGregor and George Clooney, are like chalk and cheese: McGregor becomes unwittingly involved in the group's activities, although ostensibly seeking to enliven his otherwise humdrum existence; Clooney is almost entirely wedded to Bridges' philosophy, although we never quite know whether he possesses superhuman (or should it be super-psychological) powers or not.

1292929,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B002VECMAE,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","You read it right, and I'm going to dive right in with what I know, as little and weird as that may be.I was not disappointed by this controversial film at all. It takes a hilarious, satirical look at the U.S. military's interest in offbeat defense ideas, including remote viewing and bizarre martial arts techniques. It centers on the beginning of the Iraq War, where we find Clooney and MacGregor wandering aimlessly--actually, looking for Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. It lampoons successfully, and some of the zingers in this film are some of the best I've heard in years.The whole thing made me laugh start to finish, and you will too. That is, if you avoid the sordid history of this movie (see below). The Brits came here years ago looking for documentary material on this stuff, the U.S. Army helped them out, and then the Brits thought they had successfully dumped all over us. The final result was this film, THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS--meaning AMERICANS. The real people involved in this from the American side were not happy about any of it.Well, it's funny, the subtle humor may not click with the average dough-head viewer, but I think especially anyone linked with the military will like this. My one gripe was the lack of respect shown to our armed forces, though the producers of this movie tried hard to respect the U.S. itself. If this was Britain's way of skewering our thought processes, they should have looked in the mirror first.Anyway, watch this cool film, buy yourself a Predator...sorry, a Defender...and become a Jedi in the New Earth Army (as it's called in this film)! It beats the hell out of STAR WARS. It's fun, it's funny and yes, it is thought-provoking.And now, the sordid history, which I think has to be revealed:1. This is from BBC Film, so be ready to encounter some seemingly un-American weirdness.2. Pete Brusso (U.S. Army, ret.), about whom I know nothing (other than he is the inventor of a simple-looking weapon used in this film), was contacted by a notorious producer named Jon Ronson of England. Ronson wanted to know about American black-ops involving psychic stuff and mind control. By the bye, you can buy one of these weapons, called ""the predator"" in this film but now known as ""the defender"".3. Brusso introduced Ronson into the world of the weird at Camp Pendleton, at Fort Bragg--and the weirder world of the Army's 1st Earth Battalion. The founder of the Battalion, Lt. Col. Jim Channon (U.S. Army), is somewhat famous. Well, don't look at me!!4. Through these and other fine men, producer Jon Ronson created a British TV special, ""Crazy Rulers of the World"", airing on Britain's Channel 4 from 2001 to 2003. Ronson's partner/researcher/main writer the entire time was one John Sergeant--don't forget the name.5. A book was written, MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS. I can't tell you who wrote it but I believe it was Sergeant. Ronson's name is on it as sole author. All I know is people here, especially the US Army, were pissed off at this Ronson clown for his TV show and the book.6. The film was made, everyone jumping up and down because it would have Jeff Bridges (as a commander LOOSELY based on Lt. Col. Channon), George Clooney (as the semi-lost Special Forces operative Lyn Cassady, rank unknown)--and Ewan MacGregor as young Bob Wilton, a Michigan-based reporter (character based on Ronson).7. John Sergeant came screaming from the wings--at least I think I have the names straight--claiming Ronson ""airbrushed"" him out of the story totally. How this occurs, I know not. Ewan was funny as hell in this excellent film, and I really don't care who he was playing. Sergeant was so angry he wrote a letter to Clooney, protesting that he had done all the work, and Ronson was nothing but a leeching producer. Heck, Sergeant said, he even wrote the book that had Ronson's name on it.How did they resolve this? Well, who cares! It's a damned good film and I take my hat off to the Brits, who didn't slam us as hard as we deserved. If you have little conscience about the U.K.'s version of Follywood, buy this thing. It is cool.And remember to give a salute to the U.S. Army's First Earth Battalion.",5,The man inside me is screaming like a little girl...'cause this thing has an ugly backstory,1272067200,"04 24, 2010",2010,4151,"['read', 'right', ""'m"", 'going', 'dive', 'right', 'what', 'know', 'little', 'weird', 'may', 'be.I', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'controversial', 'film', 'hilarious', 'satirical', 'look', 'U.S.', 'military', 'interest', 'offbeat', 'defense', 'ideas', 'including', 'remote', 'viewing', 'bizarre', 'martial', 'arts', 'techniques', 'beginning', 'Iraq', 'War', 'where', 'find', 'Clooney', 'MacGregor', 'wandering', 'aimlessly', 'actually', 'looking', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'successfully', 'zingers', 'film', 'are', 'best', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'years.The', 'whole', 'thing', 'made', 'laugh', 'start', 'finish', 'will', 'too', 'avoid', 'sordid', 'history', 'movie', 'see', 'Brits', 'came', 'here', 'years', 'ago', 'looking', 'documentary', 'material', 'stuff', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'helped', 'out', 'then', 'Brits', 'thought', 'had', 'successfully', 'dumped', 'final', 'result', 'was', 'film', 'THE', 'MEN', 'WHO', 'STARE', 'AT', 'GOATS', 'meaning', 'AMERICANS', 'real', 'people', 'involved', 'American', 'side', 'were', 'not', 'happy', 'it.Well', 'funny', 'subtle', 'humor', 'may', 'not', 'click', 'average', 'dough-head', 'viewer', 'think', 'especially', 'anyone', 'linked', 'military', 'will', 'like', 'one', 'gripe', 'was', 'lack', 'respect', 'shown', 'armed', 'forces', 'producers', 'movie', 'tried', 'hard', 'respect', 'U.S.', 'was', 'Britain', 'way', 'skewering', 'thought', 'processes', 'should', 'have', 'looked', 'mirror', 'first.Anyway', 'watch', 'cool', 'film', 'buy', 'Predator', 'sorry', 'Defender', 'become', 'Jedi', 'New', 'Earth', 'Army', 'called', 'film', 'hell', 'STAR', 'WARS', 'fun', 'funny', 'yes', 'thought-provoking.And', 'now', 'sordid', 'history', 'think', 'be', 'revealed:1', 'BBC', 'Film', 'so', 'be', 'ready', 'encounter', 'seemingly', 'un-American', 'weirdness.2', 'Pete', 'Brusso', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'ret', 'whom', 'know', 'nothing', 'other', 'inventor', 'simple-looking', 'weapon', 'used', 'film', 'was', 'contacted', 'notorious', 'producer', 'named', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'England', 'Ronson', 'wanted', 'know', 'American', 'black-ops', 'involving', 'psychic', 'stuff', 'mind', 'control', 'bye', 'can', 'buy', 'one', 'weapons', 'called', 'predator', 'film', 'now', 'known', 'defender', '.3', 'Brusso', 'introduced', 'Ronson', 'world', 'weird', 'Camp', 'Pendleton', 'Fort', 'Bragg', 'weirder', 'world', 'Army', '1st', 'Earth', 'Battalion', 'founder', 'Battalion', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Jim', 'Channon', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'somewhat', 'famous', 'Well', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', '4', 'other', 'fine', 'men', 'producer', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'created', 'British', 'TV', 'special', 'Crazy', 'Rulers', 'World', 'airing', 'Britain', 'Channel', '4', '2001', '2003', 'Ronson', 'partner/researcher/main', 'writer', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'one', 'John', 'Sergeant', 'do', ""n't"", 'forget', 'name.5', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'MEN', 'WHO', 'STARE', 'AT', 'GOATS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'who', 'wrote', 'believe', 'was', 'Sergeant', 'Ronson', 'name', 'sole', 'author', 'know', 'people', 'here', 'especially', 'US', 'Army', 'were', 'pissed', 'off', 'Ronson', 'clown', 'TV', 'show', 'book.6', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'everyone', 'jumping', 'up', 'down', 'would', 'have', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'commander', 'LOOSELY', 'based', 'Lt.', 'Col.', 'Channon', 'George', 'Clooney', 'semi-lost', 'Special', 'Forces', 'operative', 'Lyn', 'Cassady', 'rank', 'unknown', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'young', 'Bob', 'Wilton', 'Michigan-based', 'reporter', 'character', 'based', 'Ronson', '.7', 'John', 'Sergeant', 'came', 'screaming', 'wings', 'least', 'think', 'have', 'names', 'straight', 'claiming', 'Ronson', 'airbrushed', 'story', 'totally', 'How', 'know', 'not', 'Ewan', 'was', 'funny', 'hell', 'excellent', 'film', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'was', 'playing', 'Sergeant', 'was', 'so', 'angry', 'wrote', 'letter', 'Clooney', 'protesting', 'had', 'done', 'work', 'Ronson', 'was', 'nothing', 'leeching', 'producer', 'Heck', 'Sergeant', 'said', 'even', 'wrote', 'book', 'had', 'Ronson', 'name', 'it.How', 'did', 'resolve', 'Well', 'who', 'damned', 'good', 'film', 'take', 'hat', 'Brits', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'slam', 'as', 'hard', 'deserved', 'have', 'little', 'conscience', 'U.K.', 'version', 'Follywood', 'buy', 'thing', 'cool.And', 'remember', 'give', 'salute', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'First', 'Earth', 'Battalion']",N/A

I personally think ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" is a curious, cerebral, funny and poignant parody/spoof of and at the same time the dedication to many outstanding films, as different as Dr. Strangelove.., Star Wars epics, The Big Lebowski, and even the Silence of the Lambs. The famous and talented actors simply bring their characters from the earlier movies to The Men Who Stare at Goats. The film is notable for the funny, surreal narrative style with numerous leaps from present day to the not so distant past, when the two superpowers tried to create super powerful weapon against each other, using the supernatural and paranormal phenomena. This is the movie where Jeff Bridges in the full Dude Lebowski mode joins the Army and forms the Special Unit, First Earth Battalion that trains the soldiers to become the ""warrior monks"" who'd possess the supernatural power and be able to use their minds as the deadly weapon. The mandatory part of the training involves LSD experimentation and daily worship of Mother Earth as a source of supernatural abilities. This is the movie, where Obi-Wan-Konobi (Ewan McGregor) has no idea who the Jedi are, and the character played by Kevin Spacey is taken by the dark side of the force because of his supernatural stubbornness and meanness. As for George Clooney's Gus, the Master, the best in the unit in the past but lost and confused now, he can't forget the death of one goat that he caused by just staring at it during the experiments. Gus believes that if he saves one goat, just one from the cruel experiments now, the dead animal would stop staring at him in his memory with the unbearable silence of the goats.In short, if you like absurdist, off-beat, cerebral films -I highly recommend this. If not - don't stare at the goats.3.5 - 4 of 5",4,Of Men and Goats,1273104000,"05 6, 2010",2010,2079,"['consider', 'darkly', 'comical', 'fantastically', 'realistic', 'comedy', 'top', 'secret', 'special', 'unit', '1980', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'brilliant', 'satire', 'war', 'paranoia', 'others', 'dismiss', 'failure', 'level', 'infamous', 'high-budget', 'desert', 'comedy', 'Cold', 'War', 'era', 'Ishtar', '1987', 'personally', 'think', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', 'curious', 'cerebral', 'funny', 'poignant', 'parody/spoof', 'same', 'time', 'dedication', 'many', 'outstanding', 'films', 'as', 'different', 'Dr.', 'Strangelove..', 'Star', 'Wars', 'epics', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'even', 'Silence', 'Lambs', 'famous', 'talented', 'actors', 'simply', 'bring', 'characters', 'earlier', 'movies', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', 'film', 'notable', 'funny', 'surreal', 'narrative', 'style', 'numerous', 'leaps', 'present', 'day', 'not', 'so', 'distant', 'past', 'when', 'two', 'superpowers', 'tried', 'create', 'super', 'powerful', 'weapon', 'other', 'using', 'supernatural', 'paranormal', 'phenomena', 'movie', 'where', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'full', 'Dude', 'Lebowski', 'mode', 'Army', 'Special', 'Unit', 'First', 'Earth', 'Battalion', 'soldiers', 'become', 'warrior', 'monks', 'who', ""'d"", 'possess', 'supernatural', 'power', 'be', 'able', 'use', 'minds', 'deadly', 'weapon', 'mandatory', 'part', 'training', 'LSD', 'experimentation', 'daily', 'worship', 'Mother', 'Earth', 'source', 'supernatural', 'abilities', 'movie', 'where', 'Obi-Wan-Konobi', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'idea', 'who', 'Jedi', 'are', 'character', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'taken', 'dark', 'side', 'force', 'supernatural', 'stubbornness', 'meanness', 'George', 'Clooney', 'Gus', 'Master', 'best', 'unit', 'past', 'lost', 'confused', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'forget', 'death', 'one', 'goat', 'caused', 'just', 'staring', 'experiments', 'Gus', 'one', 'goat', 'just', 'one', 'cruel', 'experiments', 'now', 'dead', 'animal', 'would', 'stop', 'staring', 'memory', 'unbearable', 'silence', 'goats.In', 'short', 'like', 'absurdist', 'off-beat', 'cerebral', 'films', '-I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'not', 'do', ""n't"", 'stare', 'goats.3.5', '4', '5']",N/A

It supposedly is based off of true events, at least the stuff from the 1980's, whereas the stuff that takes place in current times is more fictional and revolves around a reporter stumbling across these men and their strange life in the military.  The movie is pretty slow at times and you spend moments wondering if 1. the military actually did any of this 2. if they did, what kind of crazies actually authorized it and 3. if they did, then the military needs a better screening process to weed out the scary-crazy people before they get into positions of authority and spend taxpayer money on a bunch of whacked out crap.Basically, the reporter in the movie runs into this guy who is giving interviews about how he was trained to be a &#34;Jedi Warrior,&#34; which means he was trained (?) to be psychic and use these abilities for the military back in the 1980's at Fort Bragg.  He can also apparently kill hamsters with his mind alone.  One thing leads to another and, while the reporter is trying to prove himself by getting into Iraq as a war reporter, he ends up meeting another one of these guys.  This one being even more &#34;powerful&#34; due to having gained the skill to kill goats just by staring at them and willing the goat to die (hence the title of the movie).They wander into Iraq and run into one trouble after another in the desert, while the guy (played by Clooney) tries to convince the reporter (played by Ewan McGregor) of his powers and tells him about the New Age style training they received from their leader, which include things such as &#34;sparkly eyes&#34; and being able to remove view (see distant things with your mind alone), and give people the &#34;death touch.&#34;Much of this movie makes little sense, but then the whole premise of a super-secret military operation being trained in freaky New Age mind techniques makes little sense.  It has a few funny moments, but eventually the movie seems to drag and there is not really much of a resolution.  I probably will never watch it again and I'm still not sure its worth watching the first time unless you like the actors involved or just want to show people how stupid crazy people can get into positions of power (supposedly) and make other people do stupid crazy things.Is this real?  Who knows...maybe.  Maybe not.  But, honestly, this movie does not make the US Military look good or smart or sane.

The former are incurably lazy creatures, driven by deadline and freebie lust.  The latter are insular and inclined to read into any film a ""text.""  As someone in between the two poles, let me step up and say that the people who merely react to ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" react badly.  They reach for ""Three Kings"" references.  They want hunkiness.  They want plots.  They want easy lumps of comedy or satire or preaching or drama.""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is a great film.  It takes an absolutely unadaptable non-fiction work that is, itself, a meandering work of discovery journalism, and yet create a narrative out of it.  There are multiple threads in Jon Ronson's book, and the film makers chose one perspective, one emotional line, to frame their film.  The film is therefore closer to ""Dr. Strangelove"" than it is to ""Three Kings,"" because its story is the elegy of good intentions turned evil, diligent service perverted by personal sin or evil force.  The film celebrates a loss, a loss not of innocence, but a loss of reform.  Ronson's book does that, as well, but the film takes this element and reflects it in the narrator as well as the story the narrator is providing, and the figure the narrator follows.The narrator (McGregor) has lost his innocence (a ""normal life""), and that prepares him to see that there is a chance at redemption (the ""big story""), and that gets corrupted (""they laugh at Barney the dinosaur""), and he emerges from the tale a harder, new man.  The story he chases is of Vietnam (the breaking of ""normal war"") and its hope for redemption (the ""Be All that You Can Be"" of the New Earth Battalion), and its destruction by the PsyOps ""Dark Side"" torture.  Interlaced stories of false redemption, where only the redeemer is left, and the redeemer must choose to fight on or accept the power of the Dark Side, play out.The performances are superb, and the visuals are lovely.  The cinematography captures changes of era and setting subtly, even as costuming and caricature play for laughs.If you see this ""move"" and ""don't get it,"" then that's alright.

The story revolves around a ""New Earth Army"" that was formed back in the 70s as a means of avoiding wars moreso than engaging in them, bringing to mind the old ""psi-ops"" and rogue warriors likeEdward Lansdale.  Bill Django is the guru of this unconventional battalion, with Jeff Bridges pretty much reprising his role as ""The Dude"" inThe Big Lebowski.  Lyn (Clooney) has a vision of his former leader and finds himself headed to Iraq to locate him.  Along the way he meets Bob (McGregor) anxious to get a story out of Iraq after breaking up with his wife (Rebecca Mader in a cameo role).  The movie seems to follow a most circuitous path with the story of the New Earth Army told in retrospect, as Lyn and Bob fight off a band of insurgents and some private contractors en route to a secret base in Iraq headed by a former nemesis Larry Hooper (Spacey).For some this may be too much fun and games, but for others it should provide a refreshing change of pace from the current staple of Iraq war movies.  After setting up a fantastic story, the movie seems to rush to a conclusion, but I think those who like this kind of intrigue will really enjoy this movie.",4,No Goats.

Having said that, the study of psy-ops has to be more interesting than the entirety of TMWSAG.Offbeat is probably the best way to describe the action as reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) stumbles upon Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) and the story of psychic Jedi Warriors being trained via a top-secret, unorthodox, hippy inspired, military attempt to bridge their attack on the enemy.

He is tolerated because he gets results.

The film gets stuck because it simultaneously has to ridicule people for searching for psychics weapons, while suggesting that they could exist.

There wasn't a lot of critics that liked the movie, but I found it to be fun and interesting. George Clooney and Jeff Bridges are great together for instance. Bridges basically playing ""the Dude"" in the military, I found to be hilarious.While Clooney's performance here is under-rated since he's not being cocky, nor does he stroll around like he's all that. When he's not just playing someone who thinks they're the hottest and coolest guy in the world, that's when he shows he can act. He's fun here as a soldier who really believes that he has special powers. Kevin Spacey also gets one of his better roles in awhile as a soldier who wants to take over the paranormal military. He has evil ideas, like training by seeing if you can kill a goat just by staring at it. I can also say that Stephen Lang (Avatar,Public Enemies) didn't have one bad role in 2009 and that he had a break out year. He's pretty funny as a Colonel who runs into walls to see if he can go through them.The movie probably could have been just a little better. Everyone is in good form, but the movie is missing something. It could have been longer and we could have learned a little bit more about this nutty army. Either way, I loved the movie.

1292955,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B002VECMAE,Jon Norris,"[1, 1]","This is a quirky, oddball comedy with some very interesting layers and connections back to 70's counterculture and secret military black projects. While not a full-blown Hollywood farce or timely put-down comedy which are so popular today, it speaks pretty loudly to those who are familiar with the subject matter. I also happen to like all the major stars involved. Equally as important to me were the Extras with interviews of some of the people on whom the book and film were based.Yes, Virginia, these things have a definite basis in real people and events.The characters and events are a mixture of fiction along with true events and real people, with the main characters being composites of some very real people. They touch on some of the stranger (declassified) programs the military has tried in an effort to anticipate the future needs and trends in warfare and military techniques. What is in the movie is a blending of at least two different programs, which may not have had much connection in real life: the First Earth Battalion and the Stargate remote viewing program. (NOT to be confused with the radical environmentalist Earth First group.)The movie really spoke to me in basic ways because I have connections to some of the material covered. Back in the 80s, I discovered and began to study the First Earth Battalion on which a large part of the movie was based. I have two copies of the original Evolutionary Tactics manual from when it was first offered to the public (through the Whole Earth Catalog folks, I believe). I was quite taken by the concept of the modern Warrior Monk, having cut my teeth on Bruce Lee's work and the original Kung-Fu TV series. I had my own T-shirts and buttons made, and seriously considered myself a member of the larger First Earth Battalion community. This was all way before the internet.I also have a colleague who studied at seminars (courtesy of the Tarrytown folks) with Jim Channon and his associate Frank Burns (not the MASH Burns). When this colleague and I first realized this unlikely connection between us (I also subscribed to the Tarrytown newsletter), we were struck by the very long odds of this happening in the remote and quite small town in which we live, kind of  like the tattoo revealing scene in the movie. He currently has one of my copies of the book.I also have all of Joe McMoneagle's books on the remote viewing program and have seen the documentary based on Schnabel's book, so I am aware of that material as well.If I didn't have these connections with the movie's content, I doubt it would have had as strong an impact, and if you don't know or understand these programs and how they fit into history and the changes in military and related areas, then the movie probably won't mean as much or be as good an experience for you.On the other hand, maybe it will make you sit up and take notice. Maybe you'll find a new part of your path in this material as well. Amazon has most of the material the movie is based upon......and more.Channon and others are also still around and going strong.

I know we have millions of women who love this man and granted he is a nice looking dude but I am just asking.  Can anyone name a movie that George Clooney has made that was actually successful?  Everyone points to the Ocean's movies and granted they were decent and very successful.  What we forget is those were not George Clooney movies.  There were about 15 stars in the series.  If I remember correctly Brad Pitt and Matt were fantastic.  Their characters were the two that pulled the movie above mediocrity.""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" was a disappointment.  I think the premise held a lot of hope but the final product fell short.  I don't want to slam the movie as it did have a few laughs here and there but you came out thinking two things.  One, the movie could have been about 80 minutes shorter, there was just no substance and two what in the hell?  A comedy should make you laugh out loud not snicker.  A comedy should have you trying to quiet down not have you attempting to stay awake.The story is focused on the military and it's obsession with ESP or psychological warfare.  As you might imagine the army struggles with the concept and flails about in numerous situations trying to keep up with the Russians.  A movie with Ewan McGregor, Kevin Spacey, Jeff Bridges and George Clooney should have been so much better.  That is too much star power to waste wandering around the desert trying to find a goat.  Not that you couldn't make a move about finding a goat, but please dear God, make it funny.I admittedly would have passed on seeing this movie since I didn't have high expectations.  I go back to my first statement challenging anyone to tell me the name of even one good George Clooney movie.  My girlfriend wanted to see it and since she is not always excited about going to the theaters, I jumped at the chance and we headed out.  She as with most women, love the aging actor.

1292960,AW3I97UR8NP7T,B002VECMAE,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[3, 3]","THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS is a film about the New Earth Army, a special forces outfit that was formed in the late 70s to become essentially ""Jedi Warriors."" They were to use the power of Mother Earth and their own innate psychic powers against the enemy in a new and non-traditional type of warfare and in essence change the world forever.  Now this might sound a little unbelievable to all you fans of Sargent Slaughter out there but that part of it is all true. There was in fact a New Earth Army formed in the very late seventies to do exactly that, and if you don't believe me you can either read the non-fiction book of the same title upon which this movie was based or watch the interviews with two of the men involved with the unit in the special features section of the DVD.  They even had some mild success killing goats with their minds. Well, one goat. it was standing next to the one they were aiming at but it still counts. Hmmm. Anyhow  I  guess even Uncle Sam was tripping out back then. Groovy, huh?It seems that this is the kind of movie that you either hate or you love. I'm in the love camp. I love the silliness, and I love it even more because of the reality of that silliness-- and the fact that it just breaks me up thinking about all these macho army types sitting around talking seriously about bending spoons. Those who hate the movie have one thing in common and that seems to be that the film lacks direction, it doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Everyone seems to like the back-story of how the unit was formed and how they trained well enough--no problems there. But after that most people claim that it comes off the tracks. And it does. The true story of the New Earth Army lacks a satisfying dramatic arc so what's a writer to do?  In this case he seems to have decided to tell the story of how a reporter became a Jedi Warrior. But he told it in such a loose manner that some of his audience was  unaware of it and others didn't get it at all.I've thought about this for a while and I think I've figured out where the movie went wrong and unfortunately what ruined it for these many is also one of the most brilliant things about the film. How's that for a dichotomy?You see somewhere along the line (probably quite early) someone said "" We should get Ewan McGregor! Who would make a better Jedi Warrior?"" Perfect casting, a brilliant idea. The audience would love it, and they did love it.

Some reviewers on this site call it ""hilarious"", but we didn't laugh out loud once, and chuckled only on occasion. Clooney's is the sole funny performance here, and even he couldn't make this exceptionally uninteresting script take flight.McGregor is almost surrealistically boring; his voice-over is pablum. Ronson's book might be good (haven't read it) but the adaptation is almost a textbook case of how to make a movie boring. The script didn't make me care about one single character, didn't deliver any deep laughs, and basically just told the story with no depth or flair. A subject this good has so many possibilities but almost none of them are explored with any grace here. Director Heslov seemed content to make the whole movie as dry as possible, and it sure got boring fast; we had to force ourselves to watch the end in hope of some payoff. Wishful thinking.It's funny that almost every review on this site, from one star to five, is getting plenty of negative votes, suggesting that there's no agreement from the audience about this movie. No wonder. It just kinda leaves you scratching your head in many ways. Such a fine cast, but even Spacey and Bridges bring no real uplift to the proceedings. It did look good in blu-ray, but there isn't enough beauty here to really make the hi-def that necessary. The extras are ok; actually, the documentary about the real-life psy-ops program is probably the best thing on this whole disc, all told.But when weak jokes about Jedis delivered by ""Jedi"" McGregor (is that the best they can do?) are among the comedy highlights, you know this baby ain't firing on all cylinders. Only Clooney made this worth watching for me, as he brings some elan to his role that no one else in the movie seemed able to muster.The dvd box text claims this is like a Coen Brothers movie; I can only imagine how much more fun they would have brought to the table with this subject.

It's based on nonfiction which makes it all the more bizarre. Having said that, if you are a person who enjoys watching eccentricity in motion, I think you will get a real kick out of Goats. The characters are representative of multiple persons who were involved in the unusual CIA operation and the actors do a fine job of capturing the essence of their roles. I must applaud the stellar performance by Goat.Ewan McGregor is an inquisitive journalist who wants to know more about the recently declassified information pertaining to the government's secret activities. He meets up with Clooney who tells him about the Jedi program (chuckle). Clooney convinces him that the two of them share a destiny and McGregor joins him on his zany mission. Jeff Bridges portrays the guy who founded the First Earth Batallion. Supposedly, the idea came to him after he fell from a helicopter while serving in Vietnam. He was injured by enemy fire and as he was being taken away to safety, he had a vision that said ""your gentleness is your strength"". He pursued the meaning of the vision and created the CIA program to conduct research and experiments so the US government could learn how to use a variety of mind over matter and mind control techniques.

And then there are stories that are supposed to be real but make you think ""Are you kidding me?"" That might be the case here with the film THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS. If nothing else you've got to love the title.Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) is an Ann Arbor newspaper man whose wife just dumped him for the paper's editor. Wanting to prove to himself and her that he's more than she realized, he volunteers to go to Iraq to report on the war and become, in essence, a man.But it isn't what it's cracked up to be as he waits for an opportunity to even enter the country. A chance meeting in a restaurant with a man he had heard of named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) changes his life forever. Before coming to Iraq Bob had interviewed a man who claimed to have psychic abilities that he was taught by the U.S. military. And Lyn was the man he said was the best of the best.When Bob refers back to this interview while talking to Lyn, he is put off at first. But a drawing made in his notebook that resembles a tattoo on Lyn's chest makes Lyn believe that the two of them have been led to one another via destiny.And so the pair head to Iraq the next day, Bob in search of a story and Lyn to fulfill a secret mission he eventually shares with Bob. While en route, Lyn shares the story of the special ops group that was founded to use psychic abilities as well as other subversive techniques.The story begins with a solider named Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who returns from Vietnam questioning why soldiers performed the way they did under fire. Given a grant and a paycheck from Uncle Sam, Bill went in search of alternative methods of gathering information. Lets just say he checked out every new age fad he could find in seventies California.From this gathering of information Bill puts together a group he calls the New Earth Army. Unorthodox doesn't quite sum up this group of soldiers who parade around with long hair and flowers among other things. And the top student Bill finds among these men is Lyn Cassady.Bill is attempting to create a super soldier; a soldier that will not have to kill unless he must, but who can use mind control to take out the enemy. Bill calls these men his Jedi warriors.As to staring at goats in the film's title, it refers to a time when Lyn was required to stare at a goat using his psychic abilities to kill the goat. He accomplishes this, the goat's heart stops and Lyn is a changed man.Back to Iraq, Bob and Lyn run into bandits, trigger happy security teams and an assortment of semi-whacky individuals while on the mission Lyn began. It isn't until later that Bob discovers the mission is to find Bill.So this movie sounds quirky and yet serious at the same time, yes? Well in a way it is. The situations involved do take on some serious moments (like when a IED/bomb blows up the car Bob and Lyn are traveling in), but at the same time almost all of the moments in this film are laced with a subtle black comedy that gives it it's charm.The actors involved do a wonderful job combining a bit of naivet&eacute;, suspicion, eagerness to learn and more. McGregor and Clooney become an interesting couple that play off of each other's character well. And Bridges takes on the role of hippy mind expansion proponent far too easily.According to a short featurette in the specials on this disc, we are given information from retired officers that there was indeed a psychic special forces group that was looking into psychic abilities and other off the wall ways to form warriors. Who knows what the end results were?You won't walk away from this film truly learning more about the secret military group or how to actually kill a goat with your mind.

What stops it from being something truly great however is that it isn't nearly as funny and comedic as it could be, and the end result is that the film overstays its welcome.  Ewan McGregor stars as journalist Bob Wilton, whose wife has recently left him, and thus has embarked on a journey to Kuwait.  While there, he meets Lyn Cassaday (George Clooney), a self-proclaimed ""Jedi warrior"" psychic trained by the Army years before.  Claiming he's on a secret mission, Lyn and Bob soon embark to Iraq.  Clooney and McGregor, along with Jeff Bridges as the pioneering Django and Kevin Spacey as the nefarious Hooper, give great performances.

1292996,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B002VECMAE,RMurray847,"[4, 8]","While not a great or meaningful movie in any way (although I suspect some of the folks involved thought it would be), THE M EN WHO STARE AT GOATS is a hoot, fueled by George Clooney's ready-to-be-patented, Coen Brothers inspired lunacy.Constructed in a needlessly hodge-podge fashion, we follow the journey of the somewhat whimpy journalist who stumbles upon a crazy-enough-to-maybe-be-true story (Ewan McGregor).  McGregor has more or less assigned himself to a middle-east beat, because he wants to prove to his estranged wife that he's an exciting man.  Unfortunately, he is actually quite a coward, and when he latches on to a story that takes him into Iraq, his need to follow the story is nearly outweighed at every turn by his great fear of being killed.The story he follows is embodied by Clooney, a mad but compelling figure who has played a part, for decades, in the US government's secret program to develop psychic powers in soldiers.  This program was proposed, sometime during the Vietnam era, by Jeff Bridges, a soldier who was allowed to ""infiltrate"" hippie culture in search of some new approach to war.  He comes back with the idea of using psychic powers to affect ""peaceful"" outcomes in conflicts.  He isn't against war, per se...he's against the idea of war needing to actually KILL anything.  Clooney is an early recruit to the program, and he shows a great deal of promise.  Later, he meets his match in the only other person with psychic powers to rival his, Kevin Spacey...a soldier who seethes with loathing for his fellow man, particularly the cowardly bunch who run this project.  He believes that the powers can be used to stop the hearts (literally) of the enemy.  Naturally, the government sees more value in this, and the program Bridges has crafted becomes corrupted, and Bridges is disgraced.Decades later, McGregor follows Clooney on a voyage through Iraq, as Clooney believes he has been ""called"" to Iraq to journey to an as yet unknown location for an unknown purpose.  McGregor sees just enough to believe that Clooney just might be for real...but he also sees enough to really worry that he is just following a dangerous nutcase.The movie is breezy and off-kilter.  Clooney has done some of his wackiest work for the Coen Brothers (particularly in O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU and the recent BURN AFTER READING).  He brings that level of goofy energy to MEN WHO STARE, and the level  to which you will enjoy this film is probably going to be determined to a large degree by how much you like seeing Clooney do this particular shtick.  I happen to enjoy it...not only is it self-effacing (which I always like to see in mega-stars) but it allows Clooney to let out the mischievousness that always seems to bubble just below his surface...and to suffuse it with a touch of melancholy.  These aren't GREAT performances, per se...but to me, they are fun.Bridges gives us much the same attitude he used in his classic role as The Dude in BIG LEBOWSKI (another Coen Brothers film), but at least his character here has a bit more ambition.  Spacey is merely adequate in his underwritten, generic role...although he does have one funny bit when he inadvertently ingests some LSD (although I always think the depiction of other people's drug-trips is less amusing for the viewer than for the actor).  McGregor, despite a barely passable American accent, is an amusing foil for Clooney...and the scruff of unshaven beard his sports makes him seem more rugged than he has in years.  I keep thinking that there is still the perfect film role for this actor...one that gives him full freedom to show off his talents (TRAINSPOTTING)...but also garners wide public notice.Director Grant Heslov, a Clooney friend and a fairly inexperienced director, does the film no favors.  The pacing needs to be brisk throughout, but it goes from breezy to leaden almost from scene to scene.  Some bits simply are allowed to go on just a beat or two too long.  And in the final scenes, when the film wants to be poignant and perhaps wants to make some statement about war or at least, our current wars...it just sort of fizzles out.  As with many comedies, all the best bits are early on.  I believe in some ways, Heslov and Clooney may have been trying to create something like a 2nd Gulf War version of THREE KINGS, but that magnificent feature that followed the 1st Gulf  War was a singularly brilliant piece of filmmaking that crackled with true creativity in every frame.  THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS is a fun, uneven but ultimately worthwhile trifle in comparison.(As a New Mexico resident, I'd also like to point out that the movie was filmed in large part in New Mexico, particularly at White  Sands National Monument.  Therefore, the scenery is a cut above average!)",4,"3.5 stars.  Amusing, but very uneven.

They're members of an elite, covert military unit - known officially as the New Earth Army and unofficially as Jedi warriors - trained to use New Age mysticism and psychic powers to defeat the enemy (their staring at the goats is supposed to result in the animals' deaths). Bob Wilton is a newspaper reporter from Ann Arbor, Michigan who becomes personally involved with the unit while serving as a war correspondent in Iraq.  He's drawn in by a retired Special Forces operator by the name of Lyn Cassady who lets Wilton in on some of his most closely guarded secrets.Based on the book by Jon Ralston, ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" claims to be based on fact.As that rare dark satire that takes on militarism and war as targets, Grant Heslov's ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" gets more points for guts and daring than it does for execution.  Its points often lack clarity and focus and the hijinks occasionally feel too much like leftovers from ""MASH"" and ""Catch-22"" for total comfort.  Yet, there are enough offbeat and humorous moments to more than compensate for the frequent concept that backfires or the occasional joke that falls flat.  The basic premise of the story seems to be that since war is the province of madmen and fools, who better fit to wage it?  And in the topsy-turvy world of Peter Straughan's screenplay, even the counterculture concept of hippy-dippy pacifism gets co-opted by the military machine.The acting throughout is first-rate.

Among the strangest articles was one on Soviet research into ""psionic warfare,"" and the U.S. Military's attempts to match it.  ""Goats"" is a satire based on a non-fiction book about the once-classified program.Viewers expecting a laugh-out-loud farce are advised to spend their money elsewhere.  Trailers endlessly feature George Clooney's character killing a goat through thought-power to imply that this movie is a comedy, but it's not.  In typically satirical fashion, the film sneers at both the Cold War hysteria which led to this program, and the New Age/Hippie philosophies which the program was supposed to investigate.  ""Goats'"" tone is only mildly amusing, with a lot of maudlin moments mixed in.  Casting is just too predictable, with Jeff Bridges as the Hippie leader of the program, Clooney as an earnest crackpot (tapping into his character in ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?""), Kevin Spacey as a neurotic weasel, and Ewan McGregor (Obi Wan Kenobi) as the journalist/apprentice to this ""Jedi"" military program.  McGregor's performance is the worst, as he struggles to maintain a neutral American accent.  The older co-stars just phone in performances they've done many times before.Perhaps the most telling indictment of this movie is that the special features - which include interviews of the book's author, and former members of the ""Jedi"" program - are much more interesting than the film itself.

As Amazon's synopsis will tell you, the movie centers around Ewan McGregor's schlub of a journalist stumbling onto a group of psi-ops ""Jedi"" who once worked for the government. The comedy ensues from his attempt to figure out whether these people truly believe what they're saying, or if he's been excluded from some really sick joke. Jeff Bridges is at his hippie best here, and Clooney gives a tongue in cheek performance as the one ""mind Jedi"" who really seems to take his beliefs off the deep end. McGregor is unfortunately relegated to being background filler, his comedic talents not being utilized by half.

1293010,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B002VECMAE,Scott FS,"[0, 1]","A ""Wild and Funny Ride"" is the blurb on the retail jewel case for ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"".  I don't agree.  I see that, with 106 reviews in as I write this, that there are more 1 star reviews than 5 star reviews.  That tells you something.Starring the usually excellent George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, and Kevin Spacey, the film just fell flat, im my opinion.  The film is well-photographed and the desert scenes are very convincing.  However, the story just rambled from point A to, well, where was it going?As I'm watching the film, I kept asking myself, 'why did they make this film?'  'What was the point?'  I still can't answer the film.  It has an slight anti-military slant to it (most of the soldiers and officers are stupid, mean-spirited, or just plain crazy).  There is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo mysticism in it, coupled with lame 'new age' spirituality and, yes, flowers.Jeff Bridges plays Bill Jango, a man who believes in the concept of a kinder, gentler Army (what???).  Yep, an army that uses flower power rather than rifles and tanks (yeah, that would work well against Hitler).  There is a slight plausibility in the approach, because they use some elements of martial arts, which we know is very effective.  But army-issued flowers?  Ah,...No.Ewan McGregor plays Bill Wilton, a reporter for a small-town paper in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  His wife leaves him for his editor, and he is a bit lost.  He wants to do something macho to maybe win her back (although that is not really part of the story).  He spies Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) at a bar in Kuwait.  He's hoping to get into Iraq as the military invades the country.  Cassady agrees to take him into the country.  Turns out that Cassady is part of a 'black-ops' team that uses psychological and psychic warfare to fight the enemy.  But there is a nemesis in the form of Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) who has little or no psychic power himself, and he's jealous of the talented Cassady, and tries to sabotages the unit.Is Cassady crazy?  Does he really have some mystical psychic powers?  Maybe.  He can make clouds 'burst' and can successfully guess 241 coin tosses in a row (why isn't this guy in Vegas???), and he can stop a goats heart by staring at it (hence the title).The movie is OK.  There seems to be a real idea here, but the movie can't make up it mind whether to be a straight comedy (albeit a black one) or an off-beat, fuzzy lampoon of the US military.I can't recommend the film for most folks.  I was bored at times, and mystified myself how this film even got made.

1293019,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B002VECMAE,The Guardian,"[0, 0]","Criticisms of the film adaptation of Jon Ronson's book ""The Men who stare at Goats"" are that it doesn't quite work as a narrative and fits no neat ""genre"" category. Is it serious drama exploring the US military's investigation of the paranormal for operational use? Is it satire, comedy, buddy-movie or what? A resemblance to early Coen Bros movies can be seen in the quirky characters, committed acting with delicious black comedy moments, sudden violence, and unpredictable plot twists. The viewer is left however with the feeling of a whole less than the sum of its parts, the result less-than-satisfying drama. But the film is nevertheless enjoyable and instructive, and worth seeing for several reasons. It deserves a place on the shelf alongside ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Catch 22"" and ""Oh What a Lovely War"" as a satire on the military mindset, but ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is unique.The raw material was supplied by British journalists Jon Ronson and John Sergeant's tongue-in-cheek investigation of the US military's secret projects exploring mind control, telekinesis, telepathy, remote viewing and methods of unconventional combat carried out in special units from the 1970s to the 1990s with varying degrees of success. The film's fictional plot is set in the early part of the 2003 Iraq war (though that war is not the film's subject, and it's not an overtly political tract). The story of the ""New Earth Army"" and their extraordinary activities is told in flashback through the experience of the Ewan McGregor character, a naive young journalist looking to prove himself after his wife leaves him by finding and writing up a big story in the danger zone. In the rooftop bar of a Kuwait hotel he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), ex-NEA warrior now middle-aged but still steeped in the belief system generated during his years spent in the ""special unit"" at Fort Brag.McGregor, Clooney, Bridges and Spacey each bring commitment and comedy to their roles, with Clooney and Bridges particularly good. Clooney is convincing as the clearly unhinged and delusional Cassady, just sane enough to be right some of the time with some genuine hit-and-miss psychic abilities and hilariously funny. Think Ulysses Everett McGill from the Coens' ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" told by the military that he has exceptional paranormal powers and is greater than the average human in capabilities. For the character played by Bridges we have ""The Dude"" from ""The Big Lebowski"", transposed wholesale into a position power in the US Army, complete with long plaited hair and fully-formed new-age philosophy so confidently expressed that he steps effortlessly into the role of Warrior-Monk-Leader-of-Men. Bridges' scenes are almost all in flashback as the inspiration and mentor of the original New Earth Army team at Fort Brag back in the day until the final part of the film when he pops up again in the current narrative older, diminished in confidence and stature, now working for scheming and malevolent former student Spacey's successful private company in Iraq.The story follows Clooney's and McGregor's characters from one gun-wielding (sometimes gun-firing) encounter to the next through a Road-to-Baghdad buddy-movie format with the history of the NEA episodically filled-in in by Clooney's revealing narrative to McGregor. The comedy lurches from brilliance to slapstick and back again, with real laugh-out-loud moments. The denouement, where NEA philosophy finally defeats current military-political paradigms is visually spectacular and in its own way logical but less than completely convincing.Much of the film's detail about the paranormal goings-on at Fort Brag over the years is reported to be pretty accurate. The zealous belief of the Bridges and Clooney characters (and others) in the fundamental value of what they are doing and their inherent superiority to those living a more mundane existence is very funny and well realised. All these actors do comedy well.Although a film with a more coherent narrative line and better editing might have been made, ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is worth seeing for the joy of the ensemble cast hamming it up, some genuinely hilarious scenes and the mind-blowing realization that the US military, with its enormous taxpayer-funded budgets, takes all this paranormal strangeness quite seriously and has devoted considerable resources into the development of effective ""psychic warriors"". The US Army really has trained men in ""remote viewing"" and to try to kill goats with mind-power, and may even as you read this be engaged in developing methods of alternative psychic warfare in ways you can't even imagine.",4,The Men who Stare at Goats Review,1274140800,"05 18, 2010",2010,4659,"['Criticisms', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'book', 'Men', 'who', 'stare', 'Goats', 'are',

1293021,A3KJ6JAZPH382D,B002VECMAE,"Tim Brough ""author and music buff""","[7, 13]","An uneven buddy caper that rides mainly on the abilities of its impeccable casting, ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" takes a seriously weird moment in military stupidity and pokes gentle fun at it. There was once a New Earth Army (called The First Earth Battalion) that the CIA experimented with as a Psychic Warfare Operation. What should have you irritated about a waste of your tax dollars gets spoofed into a Hollywood movie. So much for the ""liberal media,"" right?As such, it's still a good time waster. Milquetoast Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) wants to prove to his ex-wife that he's an exciting man, so he talks his way into an Iraqi reporter position. It is there where he bumbles into the Special Forces Operator, Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), whom Bob once referenced in a story about psychic warfare. Soon Bob convinces Lyn to take him along on his mission, and Lyn's intermittent explanations about the New Earth Army appears in anecdotal bits, often very humorously.The supporting cast makes up for the slowness of the overall film, with Jeff Bridges leading the pack as Bill Django, the best of the psychic warriors. Stephen Lang steals the show in just a few scenes as somewhat loopy Brigadier General Dean Hopgood. Kevin Spacey is fine as the creepy trouble maker Larry Hooper, but you've seen him do this a million times and his character here has nothing new to offer. And finally, Robert Patrick is a hoot as contractor at large Todd Nixon, appearing for no apparent reason but still amusing.""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" is episodic, and that's its main drag. It never seems to find its footing, and the ending is contrived. Theoriginal non-fiction bookdetailed disturbing and often hilarious interviews with men who would tell journalist Jon Ronson about the real attempts Presidents Reagen and Bush 2 put into creating these regiments. But as the movie sputters into its final act and all Jon/Bob gets out of his reports is either ignored or mocked, its a bit frustrating to watch the movie of his work walk the wire between reality and the farcical so unevenly.",3,"Baa baa, said the goat",1259452800,"11 29, 2009",2009,2077,"['uneven', 'buddy', 'caper', 'mainly', 'abilities', 'impeccable', 'casting', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', 'seriously', 'weird', 'moment', 'military', 'stupidity', 'pokes', 'gentle', 'fun', 'was', 'once', 'New', 'Earth', 'Army', 'called', 'First', 'Earth', 'Battalion', 'CIA', 'experimented', 'Psychic', 'Warfare', 'Operation', 'What', 'should', 'have', 'irritated', 'waste', 'tax', 'dollars', 'spoofed', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'liberal', 'media', 'right', 'such', 'still', 'good', 'time', 'waster', 'Milquetoast', 'Bob', 'Wilton', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'prove', 'ex-wife', 'exciting', 'man', 'way', 'Iraqi', 'reporter', 'position', 'there', 'where', 'Special', 'Forces', 'Operator', 'Lyn', 'Cassady', 'George', 'Clooney', 'whom', 'Bob', 'once', 'referenced', 'story', 'psychic', 'warfare', 'Soon', 'Bob', 'Lyn', 'take', 'along', 'mission', 'Lyn', 'intermittent', 'explanations', 'New', 'Earth', 'Army', 'anecdotal', 'bits', 'often', 'very', 'humorously.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'up', 'slowness', 'overall', 'film', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'leading', 'pack', 'Bill', 'Django', 'best', 'psychic', 'warriors', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'steals', 'show', 'just', 'few', 'scenes', 'somewhat', 'Brigadier', 'General', 'Dean', 'Hopgood', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'fine', 'creepy', 'trouble', 'maker', 'Larry', 'Hooper', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'do', 'million', 'times', 'character', 'here', 'nothing', 'new', 'offer', 'finally', 'Robert', 'Patrick', 'hoot', 'contractor', 'large', 'Todd', 'Nixon', 'appearing', 'apparent', 'reason', 'still', 'amusing', 'Men', 'Who', 'Stare', 'Goats', 'episodic', 'main', 'drag', 'never', 'find', 'footing', 'ending', 'contrived', 'Theoriginal', 'non-fiction', 'bookdetailed', 'disturbing', 'often', 'hilarious', 'interviews', 'men', 'who', 'would', 'tell', 'journalist', 'Jon', 'Ronson', 'real', 'attempts', 'Presidents', 'Reagen', 'Bush', '2', 'put', 'creating', 'regiments', 'movie', 'final', 'act', 'Jon/Bob', 'reports', 'either', 'ignored', 'mocked', 'bit', 'frustrating', 'watch', 'movie', 'work', 'walk', 'wire', 'reality', 'farcical', 'so', 'unevenly']",N/A
1293022,AJYGQV81FSFE2,B002VECMAE,Timothy P. Scanlon,"[2, 6]","As George Clooney and Jeff Bridges, two of my favorites, were in this flick--and a critic compared it with something Stanley Kubrick might have done--I had to go see it.It starts with an army general, convinced of his supernatural powers, attempts to pass through a wall. The scene itself broke me up.Then we're introduced to Lyn Cassady (Clooney). He reminded me of what many a Clooney character reminds me of: eccentric! he rambles on about a special military unit dedicated to, in effect, the supernatural. Shortly after, you see another eccentric, Bill Django (Bridges).One of the reasons Django broke me up is first, one could see how he ""developed."" He got into a Woodstockesque mode, was contemplating reality in a jaccuzzi, etc. In short, if it weren't for Bridges' role in another of my favorites, ""The Big Lebowski,"" he wouldn't have fit into this film.I'll be much less long winded in my review here because I don't think the film's ""plot"" did much for me. It was more like a series of sight gags that broke me up. I found myself laughing frequently, but not at a plot that was brilliantly done, or anything else particularly erudite.Oh, and another actor whose role in this film I looked forward to was that of Kevin Spacey, who played Larry Hooper. And he didn't let me down either.In short, if you're looking for a moving experience, something you'll be pondering for hours with your grande latte, this probably isn't the film for you. But if you want to laugh at gags, some of them familar, some of them not, at 60s-esque cliches (with some you may very well be familiar), then you may enjoy it. I certainly did.And at the end, you may be a little surprised at the lead character's (Bob Wilton/Ewan McGregor) attempt to do what the general attempted at the beginning of the story.",4,"Pointless script, but hilarious",1258588800,"11 19, 2009",2009,1795,"['George', 'Clooney', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'two', 'favorites', 'were', 'flick', 'critic', 'compared', 'something', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'might', 'have', 'done', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'it.It', 'starts', 'army', 'general', 'convinced', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'attempts', 'pass', 'wall', 'scene', 'broke', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'Lyn', 'Cassady', 'Clooney', 'reminded', 'what', 'many', 'Clooney', 'character', 'eccentric', 'special', 'military', 'unit', 'dedicated', 'effect', 'supernatural', 'Shortly', 'see', 'eccentric', 'Bill', 'Django', 'Bridges', '.One', 'reasons', 'Django', 'broke', 'up', 'first', 'one', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'developed', 'got', 'Woodstockesque', 'mode', 'was', 'contemplating', 'reality', 'jaccuzzi', 'etc', 'short', 'were', ""n't"", 'Bridges', 'role', 'favorites', 'Big', 'Lebowski', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'fit', 'film.I', ""'ll"", 'be', 'much', 'less', 'long', 'winded', 'review', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'plot', 'did', 'much', 'was', 'more', 'series', 'sight', 'gags', 'broke', 'found', 'laughing', 'frequently', 'not', 'plot', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'done', 'anything', 'else', 'particularly', 'erudite.Oh', 'actor', 'role', 'film', 'looked', 'forward', 'was', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'who', 'played', 'Larry', 'Hooper', 'did', ""n't"", 'let', 'down', 'either.In', 'short', ""'re"", 'looking', 'moving', 'experience', 'something', ""'ll"", 'be', 'pondering', 'hours', 'grande', 'latte', 'probably', ""n't"", 'film', 'want', 'laugh', 'gags', 'familar', 'not', '60s-esque', 'cliches', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'familiar', 'then', 'may', 'enjoy', 'certainly', 'did.And', 'end', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'surprised', 'lead', 'character', 'Bob', 'Wilton/Ewan', 'McGregor', 'attempt', 'do', 'what', 'general', 'attempted', 'beginning', 'story']",N/A
1293023,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,B002VECMAE,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[2, 2]","Movie - 3.5Before viewing this, I'd only seen a couple of trailers for the movie between its theatrical debut and now. The cast itself looked awesome enough and I thought it'd turn out to be a pretty goofy and screwball kind of comedy. After actually seeing it, though.. I'm not so sure what to think. Probably the weirdest movie I've seen since Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Goats is probably 2nd underneath it now. You would think a premise of flower-wielding, Buddhist-hippie-inspired, Jedi-proclaiming psychics as a military cover up would make for lots of laughs and quirky humor, right? Well what if I told you this wasn't some ridiculous, made-up story and that it was intended to be based on something true? I had a lot of trouble deciding whether or not this was a straight comedy, a satire, or a mix of the two. The characters are likable and well-portrayed by their respective actors, but the narrative never makes clear enough that this is something I should either be taking seriously or with a grain of salt. Aside from that, though, it's still fairly enjoyable. The script has a good deal of wit and the pacing is fairly steady thanks to Ewan McGregor's narration. I just wish I could say more about the movie, but frankly, I was never sure what the point was in the first place. However, the eccentricity and oddness in themselves do have a certain charm and might make for a unique viewing experience. This film is not recommended for people unaccustomed to the weird and unusual. But if you want something different and adventurously goofy, give it a rent. In fact, give it multiple viewings. I think this might be one of those titles that needs it.Video - 4.0Presented by Starz / Anchor Bay using the MPEG-4 AVC codec in an aspect ratio of 2.39:1, Goats looks good enough. The image shows variations in color vibrancy and sharpness ranging from drab to excellent, though is most likely a result of the photography (think Michael Clayton). Black levels and contrast are fairly well-produced revealing great amounts of detail as well in some of the closeup shots of the actors, and even some of the backgrounds, objects, and goats. There aren't any signs of artifacting or debris either. All in all, it's a good transfer, but nothing especially remarkable or stunning, even for a recent release.Audio - 4.5Although mostly dialogue-driven, Goats has a surprisingly buoyant TrueHD 5.1 track. Dialogue is clear and easy to understand, driving itself mostly from the center channel, but the star of the audio is in the musical immersion and slight instances of gunfire. While Rolfe Kent's score isn't as captivating as his work for Up in the Air, Goats makes up for it a little easier by offering Boston's More Than a Feeling in lossless audio. Along with that most notable of notes, I feel a lot of the movie is as enjoyable as it is because of the music supervision. The front sound stage and side surrounds do an ample job engaging the viewer and thoroughly reflecting much of the film's mood through its soundtrack. The instances of gunfire aren't very often and only happen for a few minutes on-screen, but when they kick in, it's actually quite robust. LFE levels, however, are a bit lacking, so don't expect much else other than some great rock music and a little shooting to work out your systems.Extras - 3.0There are 2 commentaries: one with director Grant Heslov and one with author of the original book Jon Ronson, a couple of featurettes talking about the back story behind the novel and its real-life counterparts, and a bunch of trailers. After watching the film initially, I desperately wanted to watch the making-of to get some answers. Problem is they didn't explain enough. I still find the story halfway implausible, but there's a part of me that wants to believe that there's more to this story and movie (a theme that's an important piece of the narrative, no doubt, and ironically is now causing me a bit of restlessness). The featurettes clock in at about 18 minutes, though I wish they were more detailed and in-depth.Overall - 4.0The Men Who Stare at Goats is odd, to say the least. The characters are quirky, the narrative is all over the place, and the logic behind it all makes an eerie amount of sense if you take some of the extra features' interviewing into account. The A/V presentation is commendable, though nothing truly outstanding. If you're in to the strange and unusual, you may want to give this multiple shots. It's definitely unique in its own brand of storytelling, but those looking for something more linear might have trouble putting this one together.

They could supposedly stop an animal's heart, do some remote viewing, locate people without much to go on, predict coin tosses, etc.  Bridges trains Clooney and others in these skills, and then things fall apart.Later, MacGregor and Clooney are in Iraq, and Clooney is convinced that he is dying of cancer due to a death touch inflicted years earlier, though as his pal says, it could be a broken heart.  Something he had believed in so much is now in shreds.The ending of the film leaves one wondering how many of these people actually existed, whether any part of the program is still being used, if the part at the end with MacG and the wall is supposed to be a metaphor, and what became of the other people.  This would have given me somewhat more satisfaction.",4,Great crazy movie; should have revealed more at end,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,1182,"['What', 'great', 'cast', 'Kevin', 'Spacey', 'serpent', 'garden', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'hippie', 'Army', 'instructor', 'Ewan', 'MacGregor', 'journalist', 'George', 'Clooney', 'former', 'student', 'Bridges', 'who', 'still', 'trying', 'hone', 'psychic', 'skills.I', ""'m"", 'curious', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'true.Apparently', 'was', 'attempt', 'create', 'new', 'kind', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'attempts', 'psychic', 'unit', 'Army', 'could', 'supposedly', 'stop', 'animal', 'heart', 'do', 'remote', 'viewing', 'locate', 'people', 'much', 'go', 'predict', 'coin', 'tosses', 'etc', 'Bridges', 'Clooney', 'others', 'skills', 'then', 'things', 'fall', 'apart.Later', 'MacGregor', 'Clooney', 'are', 'Iraq', 'Clooney', 'convinced', 'dying', 'cancer', 'due', 'death', 'touch', 'inflicted', 'years', 'earlier', 'pal', 'could', 'be', 'broken', 'heart', 'Something', 'had', 'believed', 'so', 'much', 'now', 'shreds.The', 'ending', 'film', 'one', 'wondering', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'actually', 'existed', 'part', 'program', 'still', 'being', 'used', 'part', 'end', 'MacG', 'wall', 'supposed', 'be', 'metaphor', 'what', 'became', 'other', 'people', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'somewhat', 'more', 'satisfaction']",N/A

When those leading men are George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey, and Ewan McGregor, that's enough to carry it most of the way through.  Each actor plays his familiar persona to the hilt.  Clooney does the charming, self-confident dim bulb bit he's been perfecting sinceO Brother, Where Art Thou.  Bridges reprisesthe Dude.  Spacey is a prissy martinet.  And McGregor--actually Ewan McGregor's charisma is muted here, but then he's been saddled with the double burdens of playing the straight man and doing an American accent.  The Men Who Stare at Goats ambles along, eventually overstaying its welcome by only ten minutes or so.
