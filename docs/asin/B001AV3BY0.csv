It's only the second show I started watching from day one and loved. Its manages to be funny and an engaging drama at the same time. Its really a medical version of CSI and both shows have a Sherlock Holmes type feel to them.The characters are excellant, and their are many great storylines and episodes. House changed it up in the fourth season by bringing in new charachters and delegating others to more minor parts, which upset many fans. The show has stayed strong despite this though the jury is still out on whether this was a mistake.This collection features the first four individual seasons and the packaging is decent, but there are no extras.",5,Dr House I presume?,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,750,"['House', 'doubt', 'best', 'scripted', 'show', 'currently', 'TV', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'only', 'second', 'show', 'started', 'watching', 'day', 'one', 'loved', 'manages', 'be', 'funny', 'engaging', 'drama', 'same', 'time', 'really', 'medical', 'version', 'CSI', 'shows', 'have', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'type', 'feel', 'them.The', 'characters', 'are', 'excellant', 'are', 'many', 'great', 'storylines', 'episodes', 'House', 'changed', 'up', 'fourth', 'season', 'bringing', 'new', 'charachters', 'delegating', 'others', 'more', 'minor', 'parts', 'upset', 'many', 'fans', 'show', 'stayed', 'strong', 'jury', 'still', 'out', 'was', 'mistake.This', 'collection', 'first', 'four', 'individual', 'seasons', 'packaging', 'decent', 'are', 'extras']",House: Seasons 1 - 4 Collection

1168549,A1MRPX3RM48T2I,B001AV3BY0,Winter,"[3, 3]","House is an extremely well-done show:  Hugh Laurie's character is the centerpiece, but the interesting balance of supporting cast really brings out the chemistry.  Critics complain that each episode is predictable, but that's not the point.  An episode of House isn't about the ""patient of the week""--it's a Sherlock Holmes story, where how the mystery is solved is far more interesting than the fact *that* it is solved.If you're in the medical profession, a lot of this may seem unbelievable.  Just remind yourself that the secondary enjoyment of this show is the vicarious thrill of watching House say things every doctor wishes they could say, or do things to a patient for which any normal doctor would be fired, or even arrested.The House Seasons 1-4 collection is just that:  a bundled package of all four boxed sets of House on DVD.  There are no bonus bundle goodies, but you get a much better deal on the set than if you'd bought each season singly.  That's not to say there's no bonus material here:  in each season you'll find extras aplenty, from deleted scenes to behind-the-scenes to bloopers, outtakes, and goofing around (Season One, for example, has scenes that for some odd reason were shot in Valley-Girl-speak).  The menus provide easy access to all episodes, an episode index, of the bonus materials, and in a nod to convenience, each disc will tell you which disc in the series contains which bonus materials:  no repeat swapping to find the bits you want to see.If you're interested in House, I highly recommend you go ahead and buy the set:  these seasons don't disappoint, and you'll end up getting more for your money.",5,The Full Laurie,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",2009,1645,"['House', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'show', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'character', 'centerpiece', 'interesting', 'balance', 'supporting', 'cast', 'really', 'out', 'chemistry', 'Critics', 'complain', 'episode', 'predictable', 'not', 'point', 'episode', 'House', ""n't"", 'patient', 'week', 'Sherlock', 'Holmes', 'story', 'where', 'how', 'mystery', 'solved', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'fact', 'solved.If', ""'re"", 'medical', 'profession', 'lot', 'may', 'seem', 'unbelievable', 'Just', 'remind', 'secondary', 'enjoyment', 'show', 'vicarious', 'thrill', 'watching', 'House', 'say', 'things', 'doctor', 'could', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'patient', 'normal', 'doctor', 'would', 'be', 'fired', 'even', 'arrested.The', 'House', 'Seasons', '1-4', 'collection', 'just', 'bundled', 'package', 'four', 'boxed', 'sets', 'House', 'DVD', 'are', 'bonus', 'bundle', 'goodies', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'deal', 'set', ""'d"", 'bought', 'season', 'singly', 'not', 'say', 'bonus', 'material', 'here', 'season', ""'ll"", 'find', 'extras', 'aplenty', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'bloopers', 'outtakes', 'goofing', 'around', 'Season', 'One', 'example', 'scenes', 'odd', 'reason', 'were', 'shot', 'Valley-Girl-speak', 'menus', 'provide', 'easy', 'access', 'episodes', 'episode', 'index', 'bonus', 'materials', 'nod', 'convenience', 'disc', 'will', 'tell', 'disc', 'series', 'bonus', 'materials', 'repeat', 'swapping', 'find', 'bits', 'want', 'see.If', ""'re"", 'interested', 'House', 'highly', 'recommend', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'set', 'seasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'disappoint', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'more', 'money']",House: Seasons 1 - 4 Collection
