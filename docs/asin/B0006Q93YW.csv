872201,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,B0006Q93YW,Alexiel,"[23, 31]","This movie has a strong sense of ""Been there, done that before."" No, I'm not talking about the characters, I'm talking about the audience. It's kind of funny, I was reviewing the C-grade horror movie ""Soul Survivors"" the other day, and, perusing the other reviews, everyone seemed to be in agreement that the movie had far too many cheats and poor explanations. In actuality, I think it's just easier to rip apart low-budget horror movies than movies with more ambition, like ""The I Inside,"" because this movie has far more cheats and dead-ends never explained than ""Soul Survivors."" ""The I Inside"" also attempts to do far more than ""Soul Survivors,"" with much loftier aims, so it fails in a more spectacular way.""The I Inside"" stars Ryan Phillippe, Sarah Polley, Piper Perabo, Robert Sean Leonard, and Stephen Rea. The casting is good, I think. First of all, I don't think Ryan Phillippe can play an out-and-out good guy. Even when he tries to cover it, he just comes off and looks like an obnoxious brat. It's really not his fault, but it's there. But in this movie, his casting works, because he is a privileged, rich... well, brat, for lack of a better term who may not be the nice guy that he seems... if you think that's a clue he's really bad though, you'd be wrong too. As for the rest of the cast, I like them. Sarah Polley has slipped a little in recent years, but looking over her body of work she is still one of the most impressive actresses of her age, I think. Stephen Rea is great in pretty much whatever he does, and Leonard is a guy I liked since ""Dead Poets Society"" and recently reaffirmed his talent in the surprising ""Tape."" Piper Perabo is surprisingly good too - I'd like her in a shallow sort of way from some of her movies like ""Lost And Delirious,"" but was not overly impressed.Anyway, the story goes - Phillippe's character, Simon Cable, awakens from a horrible accident. He thinks it's 2000, but in actuality, it's 2002. He seems to have amnesia about quite a number of things. His doctors tell him it looks like he may have been poisoned. He meets his wife, she leaves, he finds out she's not his wife, and meets another woman, his ""real"" wife, and finds out she may not be what she seems either. Then a vanishing medic tries to kill him, and from there things get truly weird. To go on would be to divulge too many spoilers.The problem with this movie is two-fold. One, it's something a bad mix of ""Memento,"" ""The Butterfly Effect,"" and even ""Soul Survivors,"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" yes. It's like a hasty grab-bag of altered reality movies/limited knowledge movies. In movies like these, you pretty much have a good idea of how things are going to unfold. You figure the things that seem intentionally confusing are going to be revealed when the movie ends and the viewer is able to connect the dots. Within the first couple of lines spoken by the doctor, you have a good idea of what the kicker is going to be. Then you go through the movie and think, ""wait, that's far too childishly obvious, it can't be that, if it was *that*, then there would be a ton of stuff unaccounted for."" Well guess what? Surprise! It really is *that.* There is a lot unaccounted for. Some critics and reviewers I've seen talking about this movie claim that everything has a good explanation. I disagree. I think if you really, really stretch the narrative beyond the breaking point, and give the creators more benefit of the doubt than you've giving anything in your entire life, you can foist a semi-plausible explanation on just about everything in the movie, but even then there are still glaring miscues. Among them, pointing them out so as not to give spoilers:#1- The medic trying to kill Cable makes no sense.#2- What Cable's brother did in the car makes no sense (you know when if you've seen the movie, it's the only thing of import he does in the car).#3- What if the time was, say, 1:57 a.m. instead? What then? You'd have a mess, that's what.All in all, maybe I'd recommend this movie as an exercise in getting a delicious little visceral thrill of being cheated or frustrated, or trying to play a game of fix the cinematic Rubik's Cube and try and account for all the problems and tidy up the explanation of the movie, but on its own merits, I cannot recommend ""The I Inside,"" despite nice performances by the cast.",2,Simply put: A blatant cheat with zero payoff.,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",2005,4341,"['movie', 'strong', 'sense', 'Been', 'there', 'done', 'before', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'characters', ""'m"", 'talking', 'audience', 'kind', 'funny', 'was', 'reviewing', 'C-grade', 'horror', 'movie', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'other', 'day', 'perusing', 'other', 'reviews', 'everyone', 'seemed', 'be', 'agreement', 'movie', 'had', 'far', 'too', 'many', 'cheats', 'poor', 'explanations', 'actuality', 'think', 'just', 'easier', 'rip', 'apart', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'movies', 'movies', 'more', 'ambition', 'Inside', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'cheats', 'dead-ends', 'never', 'explained', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'Inside', 'also', 'do', 'far', 'more', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'much', 'loftier', 'aims', 'more', 'spectacular', 'way', 'Inside', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'casting', 'good', 'think', 'First', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'can', 'play', 'out-and-out', 'good', 'guy', 'Even', 'when', 'cover', 'just', 'off', 'obnoxious', 'brat', 'really', 'not', 'fault', 'there', 'movie', 'casting', 'works', 'privileged', 'rich', 'well', 'brat', 'lack', 'better', 'term', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'nice', 'guy', 'think', 'clue', 'really', 'bad', ""'d"", 'be', 'wrong', 'too', 'rest', 'cast', 'like', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'slipped', 'little', 'recent', 'years', 'looking', 'body', 'work', 'still', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'actresses', 'age', 'think', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'great', 'pretty', 'much', 'Leonard', 'guy', 'liked', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'recently', 'reaffirmed', 'talent', 'surprising', 'Tape', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'too', ""'d"", 'like', 'shallow', 'sort', 'way', 'movies', 'Lost', 'Delirious', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'impressed.Anyway', 'story', 'Phillippe', 'character', 'Simon', 'Cable', 'horrible', 'accident', '2000', 'actuality', '2002', 'have', 'amnesia', 'quite', 'number', 'things', 'doctors', 'tell', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'poisoned', 'wife', 'out', 'not', 'wife', 'woman', 'real', 'wife', 'out', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'either', 'Then', 'vanishing', 'medic', 'tries', 'kill', 'things', 'get', 'truly', 'weird', 'go', 'would', 'be', 'divulge', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers.The', 'problem', 'movie', 'two-fold', 'One', 'something', 'bad', 'mix', 'Memento', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'even', 'Soul', 'Survivors', 'Mulholland', 'Drive', 'yes', 'hasty', 'grab-bag', 'altered', 'reality', 'movies/limited', 'knowledge', 'movies', 'movies', 'pretty', 'much', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'how', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'unfold', 'figure', 'things', 'seem', 'intentionally', 'confusing', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'revealed', 'when', 'movie', 'viewer', 'able', 'connect', 'dots', 'first', 'couple', 'lines', 'spoken', 'doctor', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'kicker', 'going', 'be', 'Then', 'go', 'movie', 'think', 'wait', 'far', 'too', 'childishly', 'obvious', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'that', 'was', '*that*', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'ton', 'stuff', 'unaccounted', 'Well', 'guess', 'what', 'Surprise', 'really', '*that', '*', 'lot', 'unaccounted', 'critics', 'reviewers', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'talking', 'movie', 'claim', 'everything', 'good', 'explanation', 'disagree', 'think', 'really', 'really', 'stretch', 'narrative', 'breaking', 'point', 'give', 'creators', 'more', 'benefit', 'doubt', ""'ve"", 'giving', 'anything', 'entire', 'life', 'can', 'foist', 'semi-plausible', 'explanation', 'just', 'everything', 'movie', 'even', 'then', 'are', 'still', 'glaring', 'miscues', 'pointing', 'out', 'so', 'not', 'give', 'spoilers', '1-', 'medic', 'trying', 'kill', 'Cable', 'sense.', '2-', 'What', 'Cable', 'brother', 'did', 'car', 'sense', 'know', 'when', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', 'only', 'thing', 'import', 'car', '3-', 'What', 'time', 'was', 'say', '1:57', 'a.m.', 'instead', 'What', 'then', ""'d"", 'have', 'mess', 'what.All', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'movie', 'exercise', 'getting', 'delicious', 'little', 'visceral', 'thrill', 'being', 'cheated', 'frustrated', 'trying', 'play', 'game', 'fix', 'cinematic', 'Rubik', 'Cube', 'try', 'account', 'problems', 'tidy', 'up', 'explanation', 'movie', 'own', 'merits', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'Inside', 'nice', 'performances', 'cast']",N/A

No more than two stars because the ending is ambiguous, and I hate that. OK, maybe this is one of those that relies on some sort of religious faith, but they don't even make that obvious.Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe) wakes up in a hospital as a result of a shock to restart his heart. He's told he's just been in a horrible accident, and lucky to be alive. However, he seems to have lost a couple of years of his memory. But things get terribly complicated pretty quickly.

Anyway, one is a blonde and the other a brunette, so the audience can tell them apart.His brother apparently died in the same accident, but the details come in a series of flashes that may be memory or may be some sort of time travel.

872206,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B0006Q93YW,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[4, 4]","THE I INSIDE (2007, 95 minutes) is the mind-bending story of Simon Cable (Ryan Philippe, erroneously credited in print as ""Phillipe"" but in fact correctly credited in the film). Simon ends up in a hospital with amnesia, slowly regaining his memory in violent, disturbing starts/stops.At a certain point, he is suddenly traveling through time, to an earlier hospital visit that also involved the death of his brother (Robert Sean Leonard). It seems he is traveling between 2002 and 2007 (in one scene it is confirmed how he gets the year 2002; in another scene he says to himself ""It's 2007""). Yep - it's puzzling as all get-out! This was sold as a time-traveller film, only ....It seems if you stick with this sloppy, rapidly moving mediocre tedium, you'll probably guess, as I did, that Simon is actually dead. The whole thing is his restless soul struggling to find a forgiveness that only he can achieve through enlightenment.Apparently Simon was a rich, spoilt psychopath in life. It is the murder of his brother, which he committed, that he must grapple before he can fully 'pass on'. It is solid enough to plot the story along the chart that he must really feel the remorse and pay dearly for it before he can move onward.The trick of the film is to hold us to the idea that Simon will somehow solve his brother's murder - we are in the dark about what happened. I suppose if the rather pathetically told story doesn't captivate you enough, there's always the thrilling muck that is supposed to be time travel.Ultimately, it will require Simon remembering his own death, plus the voices of his brother and even his father (the immortal and always undersold Stephen Rea) telling him he's dead. All that learning, worrying, investigating - and I can only guess his ghost is haunting the hospital setting the entire time - only to have to be told by his father and brother that he's dead already!!The film is clever about the way his brother and father are introduced to us.This film reminds me way too much of everything from the staggering classicMemento (10th Anniversary Special Edition) [Blu-ray] toHaunting of Amelia(a/k/a THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS, 2008 and very likely inspired by this film) andThe Life Before Her Eyesof the same year, 2007 (see my reviews) to say nothing of the recentSource Code(which I believe may also be a highly rebooted remake of this film, since it also purports to be time travel but is not; see my review). It's all too much of the same old heartburn for my taste.In other words, too much trash in this particular can for my taste. What stuns me is the way all the talent is drawn into this sort of thing. One would think Ryan was too busy at the time, as I would have thought Stephen Rea would also have been; Stephen Lang, that endearingly goofy character actor, is right at home and we also have Piper Perabo. I was even more startled at the lack of Thomas Hayden Church in the role of Philippe's brother.I will give credit where it is due: this film does present a compelling set of ideas about what might lie ahead for us after we die. Decisions, decisions. Clean-up of past errors in thinking. Admission of guilt. And then what? We get to go to God? We get to rest? I admire the fact that this film addresses none of those questions. It just shows what a person seems to need in order to have peace. Apparently, it involves time travel when space and time are no longer a consideration or an obstacle.Ultimately I love a film that promotes peace at any cost. And I still love Ryan Philippe and Stephen Rea as always - and will watch anything with them in it.",3,"SPOILER ALERT, if anyone even cares",1342828800,"07 21, 2012",2012,3606,"['INSIDE', '2007', '95', 'minutes', 'mind-bending', 'story', 'Simon', 'Cable', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'erroneously', 'credited', 'print', 'Phillipe', 'fact', 'correctly', 'credited', 'film', 'Simon', 'up', 'hospital', 'amnesia', 'slowly', 'regaining', 'memory', 'violent', 'disturbing', 'starts/stops.At', 'certain', 'point', 'suddenly', 'traveling', 'time', 'earlier', 'hospital', 'visit', 'also', 'involved', 'death', 'brother', 'Robert', 'Sean', 'Leonard', 'traveling', '2002', '2007', 'one', 'scene', 'confirmed', 'how', 'year', '2002', 'scene', '2007', 'Yep', 'puzzling', 'get-out', 'was', 'sold', 'time-traveller', 'film', 'only', '.It', 'stick', 'sloppy', 'rapidly', 'moving', 'mediocre', 'tedium', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'guess', 'did', 'Simon', 'actually', 'dead', 'whole', 'thing', 'restless', 'soul', 'struggling', 'find', 'forgiveness', 'only', 'can', 'achieve', 'enlightenment.Apparently', 'Simon', 'was', 'rich', 'spoilt', 'psychopath', 'life', 'murder', 'brother', 'committed', 'must', 'grapple', 'can', 'fully', ""'pass"", 'solid', 'enough', 'plot', 'story', 'chart', 'must', 'really', 'feel', 'remorse', 'pay', 'dearly', 'can', 'move', 'onward.The', 'trick', 'film', 'hold', 'idea', 'Simon', 'will', 'somehow', 'solve', 'brother', 'murder', 'are', 'dark', 'what', 'happened', 'suppose', 'rather', 'pathetically', 'told', 'story', ""n't"", 'captivate', 'enough', 'always', 'thrilling', 'muck', 'supposed', 'be', 'time', 'travel.Ultimately', 'will', 'require', 'Simon', 'remembering', 'own', 'death', 'voices', 'brother', 'even', 'father', 'immortal', 'always', 'undersold', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'telling', 'dead', 'learning', 'worrying', 'investigating', 'can', 'only', 'guess', 'ghost', 'haunting', 'hospital', 'setting', 'entire', 'time', 'only', 'have', 'be', 'told', 'father', 'brother', 'dead', 'already', 'film', 'clever', 'way', 'brother', 'father', 'are', 'introduced', 'us.This', 'film', 'reminds', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'everything', 'staggering', 'classicMemento', '10th', 'Anniversary', 'Special', 'Edition', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'toHaunting', 'Amelia', 'THE', 'OTHER', 'SIDE', 'THE', 'TRACKS', '2008', 'very', 'likely', 'inspired', 'film', 'Life', 'Her', 'Eyesof', 'same', 'year', '2007', 'see', 'reviews', 'say', 'nothing', 'recentSource', 'Code', 'believe', 'may', 'also', 'be', 'highly', 'rebooted', 'remake', 'film', 'also', 'be', 'time', 'travel', 'not', 'see', 'review', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'old', 'heartburn', 'taste.In', 'other', 'words', 'too', 'much', 'trash', 'particular', 'can', 'taste', 'What', 'stuns', 'way', 'talent', 'drawn', 'sort', 'thing', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Ryan', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'time', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'would', 'also', 'have', 'been', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'endearingly', 'goofy', 'character', 'actor', 'right', 'home', 'also', 'have', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'startled', 'lack', 'Thomas', 'Hayden', 'Church', 'role', 'Philippe', 'brother.I', 'will', 'give', 'credit', 'where', 'due', 'film', 'present', 'compelling', 'set', 'ideas', 'what', 'might', 'lie', 'ahead', 'die', 'Decisions', 'decisions', 'Clean-up', 'past', 'errors', 'thinking', 'Admission', 'guilt', 'then', 'what', 'get', 'go', 'God', 'get', 'rest', 'admire', 'fact', 'film', 'none', 'questions', 'just', 'what', 'person', 'need', 'order', 'have', 'peace', 'Apparently', 'time', 'travel', 'when', 'space', 'time', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'consideration', 'obstacle.Ultimately', 'love', 'film', 'peace', 'cost', 'still', 'love', 'Ryan', 'Philippe', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'always', 'will', 'watch', 'anything']",N/A
872207,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0006Q93YW,Grady Harp,"[27, 32]","THE I INSIDE is a very fine film that deserves a wide audience.  It ranks up there with 'MEMENTO', 'THE SIXTH SENSE', and 'JACOB'S LADDER' as the sort of intelligent film that demands intensive participation on the part of the viewer to catch all of its nuances and possible plot variations.Based on a play Michael Cooney who also wrote the screenplay and directed with considerable finesse by Roland Suso Richter, the story involves a bizarre mix of altered circumstances surrounding the hospitalization  of Simon Cable (Ryan Phillippe in a performance that is the finest of his career and promises much more from this actor) whose circumstances for awakening under the care of one Dr Jeremy Newman (Stephen Rea) are nebulous. Dr Newman who slowly reveals to Simon that he is suffering from acute memory loss due to trauma and possible poisoning (he had undergone cardiac arrest and was resuscitated) and yet warmly reassures him he will soon return to normal.  In essence Simon has 'lost' two years of his life, finding through the blur of amnesia that he has a wife Anna (Piper Perabo) who secretly reveals to him that there is a murder in his history that is part of an evil 'plan'.  He also encounters Clair (Sarah Polley) who claims they are lovers.  Simon is informed that his brother Peter (Robert Sean Leonard) is dead: Anna supports the premise that Simon killed him.  The ingredients of the mystery of the lost two years are set in motion.The connection between the past in 2000 and the 'present' in 2002 is slowly revealed in mind-boggling flashbacks and re-runs of possibilities: apparently the misdeeds of 2000 included an auto accident which resulted in Simon's hospitalization in the very place he finds himself in 2002 and in which his brother Peter died.  Tense confrontations and secrets begin to surface and even the concept that if we re-enter our past we can change the future is presented convincingly.  Yet how this all plays out is the magic of this fine film.  There are so many avenues that could represent the 'true story' of Simon's life and his amnesia-altered past two years that it is truly up to the viewer to decide how this film ends!The performances are all fine: Ryan Phillippe is superb, capturing all facets of this deluded young man and finding the strength of character in his Simon portrayal that makes us willing to identify with him at every turn.  The photography by Martin Langer is moody and atmospheric without resorting to the usual fright tactics.  The musical score by Nicholas Pike enhances every frame.  But it is the terse direction of Richter that makes this thriller sail into the ranks of the truly fine films of this genre.

872208,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006Q93YW,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 4]","I forgot that I'd watched Roland Suso Richter's ""The I Inside"" so I rented it a second time.  Ryan Phillippe plays Simon Cable, an accident victim who has lost his memory.  Phillippe has played in some films that I've watched recently such asStop-Loss,Breach (Widescreen Edition)&Chaos.  He does a good job with the tensions of trying to work out a puzzle, being time shifted between 2000 & 2002, and finding himself in various locations with the blink of an eye.  He fails to remember that he got married to a woman who likes his money more than him.  Piper Pearbo who was inThe Prestige&10th and Wolfplays a cold icy wife in 2002 and the uncertain nurse in 2000.  She does a good job with bouncing between the two roles.  Robert Sean Leonard who plays Dr. James Wilson on TV's ""House"" plays Simon's dead brother Peter.  It is trying to recall those events upon which the film hinges.  Sarah Poley had an Oscar nomination last year for Best Adapted Screenplay for the filmAway from Herthat starred Julie Christie.  Here she plays Claire, a love interest that came between the two brothers.  Stephen Rea who did a great job inTara Roadplays the pediatrician Dr. Newman who treats Simon, for a reason we come to find out at the end of the film.  Stephen Lang who plays a heart transplant patient, British actress Rakie Ayola who plays Nurse Clayton and Stephen Graham fromGangs of New York (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)as the orderly Travis all do sterling jobs in small but important supporting roles.  The star of this film is its editing as the plot bounces around in Simon's confused mind.  The ending was a bit of a downer for me, kind of a ""Groundhogs Day"" repetition.  I was interested through most of the film and then asked myself ""Is that all there is?"" as the credits rolled.  Still, it is a stylish puzzle piece, worth watching once or twice, depending on if you remember that you've seen it!

For some reason this never got a cinema release here in the UK, and has gone straight to DVD. But do not let this put you off if you're a UK viewer. It's an excellent, thought-provoking movie. I first saw it here on Amazon, and it was the cover that attracted me to getting the movie. And I have to admit, although the storyline is very confusing, and jumps back and forth in time, I managed to follow it - and if I managed to follow it, then anyone can! :)I quite like the cast in this, especially Ryan Phillippe, who seems to have fallen in terms to his wife's success. The cast was originally meant to be Christian Slater (as Peter), Stephen Dorff (as Simon Cable), and Jennifer Love Hewitt (as Anna Cable). I could see that working, but then again, they all just had that chemistry that they were able to work together. I nearly didn't recognise Piper Perabo, as I've previously only seen her in Coyote Ugly & Cheaper By The Dozen, and in this, she's cut, straightened & dyed her hair. It looks awfully thin too.There's not much I can say about this film without getting my butt kicked by Amazon, so you'll just have to see it for yourself. I'll give you a small warning just now - the beginning is the end. When the credits roll expect to be really confused. But it's also one of those films that leave you thinking about it afterwards. While Butterfly Effect was relatively straight forward, this makes you wonder what really happened, and would probably take a second or third viewing to work things out. I think I know what happened, but I imagine there's a lot of different theories out there. Some viewers/reviewers will see the ending as being weak, but you have to read between the lines to work out the ending.I doubt this movie would have worked with any other actor in the role apart from Ryan, as he's in nearly every scene. So if you're not a fan of Ryan, it's probably not a great idea to watch this, as you'll be sick of the sight of him by the end of the movie.The director has worked wonders with this film, as you do actually feel part of the film, and you feel as confused as Ryan's character often does. There's loads of different camera angles, which will you leave you disorientated and dizzy, or maybe the latter was just me!The extras are very boring, and the trailer does well by revealing nothing about the movie. It could have gone either way with this type of movie, and you'd have figured it out before you started watching the movie.I can't say much more, apart from watch this movie for yourself.

That is the dilemma faced by Simon Cable in The I Inside. This ambitious thriller has you piecing together the puzzle along side it's star Ryan Phillippe. The I Inside jumps around, far too much, between past, present, and future to tell it's story, a story that you really won't care about. It's a very uninteresting tale, that is told to you a piece at a time and to be honest, that's why you watch the film. It's confusing and not very good, but once you've invested the time, you want to know what happens. Ryan Phillippe was Brilliant as Simon Cable, proving that it really isn't all about the looks, he can act too, but again it's wasted talent in a very uninteresting tale. Phillippe is paired with Sarah Polley, who I absolutely love, the fact that she was in this film, is what put it on my radar, but she easily gives the worst performance of her career. Yes, the story wasn't very well written, but if everyone had put the energy into their roles that Phillippe did, the film would have at least had some credibility. The films Director is Roland Richter, was directing his first film in the United States. I don't know about movies in Germany, but here in the United States, if you're going to release a jumpy, confusing film, you'd had better make the story worth while. Richter fails to do that and the result is a slow, confusing film, that has you asking, ""is that it? Really?"" The I Inside is unique and will make you think, but the story being told, really isn't worth the time it takes to piece it all together.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",2013,1680,"['Imagine', 'waking', 'up', 'hospital', 'accident', 'not', 'knowing', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'realizing', 'two', 'years', 'later', 'thought', 'was', 'dilemma', 'faced', 'Simon', 'Cable', 'Inside', 'ambitious', 'thriller', 'piecing', 'together', 'puzzle', 'side', 'star', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'Inside', 'around', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'tell', 'story', 'story', 'really', 'wo', ""n't"", 'care', 'about', 'very', 'uninteresting', 'tale', 'told', 'piece', 'time', 'be', 'honest', 'why', 'watch', 'film', 'confusing', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'once', ""'ve"", 'invested', 'time', 'want', 'know', 'what', 'Ryan', 'Phillippe', 'was', 'Brilliant', 'Simon', 'Cable', 'proving', 'really', ""n't"", 'looks', 'can', 'act', 'too', 'again', 'wasted', 'talent', 'very', 'uninteresting', 'tale', 'Phillippe', 'paired', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'who', 'absolutely', 'love', 'fact', 'was', 'film', 'what', 'put', 'radar', 'easily', 'worst', 'performance', 'career', 'Yes', 'story', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'well', 'written', 'everyone', 'had', 'put', 'energy', 'roles', 'Phillippe', 'did', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'had', 'credibility', 'films', 'Director', 'Roland', 'Richter', 'was', 'directing', 'first', 'film', 'United', 'States', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movies', 'Germany', 'here', 'United', 'States', ""'re"", 'going', 'release', 'jumpy', 'confusing', 'film', ""'d"", 'had', 'better', 'make', 'story', 'worth', 'Richter', 'do', 'result', 'slow', 'confusing', 'film', 'asking', 'Really', 'Inside', 'unique', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'really', ""n't"", 'worth', 'time', 'piece', 'together']",N/A
