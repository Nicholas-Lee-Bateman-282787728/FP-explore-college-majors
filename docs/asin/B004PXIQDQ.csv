My tastes are varied from shallow comedies, dramas, thrillers, horror, romance to zombies. It seems like I find myself watching more Asian movies than anything else. I am drawn to movies that make you feel deeply and I find a lot of those in asian films. A Brand New Life takes you on a journey with this cute little girl that is dropped off by her dad, who she clearly worships and adores, at an orphanage. I would watch any film this girl is in. She is an amazing actress. The film is very well made, great writing, directing and acting.

1423813,A3UMYHPG4TB3TS,B004PXIQDQ,F. Sassi,"[1, 1]","This is a sad movie about a kid given up to an orphanage by her father. Only this could be a recipe for a tear-jerker, hear-breaker without much else to say. Instead, the movie uses this beginning to explore the personality of a kid, her dreams, expectations, all the simple but at the same time complex emotions that she experiences given the extremely painful events she lives thru. She leans on her newly acquired friends, to only discover that life of the adults is still able to take control of hers, to hurt her once more. I was totally absorbed by the very realistic performance not only of this kid, but also of the others in the orphanage. Without giving away too much of the plot, the movie reaches a somewhat uplifting conclusion, one in which the little kid, notwithstanding her young age, grows psychologically to develop a personality with which she can become a functioning member of the adult's society. Worth seeing every single frame.

1423815,A5DFSKG8NZHIP,B004PXIQDQ,"Keith R. Sauerwald ""Aves Para Siempre.""","[11, 13]","One day recently, I was trolling through the tv channels, looking for something to watch.I came across this movie which was just seconds into its beginning.At that moment, I had no idea of what it was about or what it had in store for me.As I continued to watch this movie (thankfully, with English subtitles), I became deeply engrossed in what was unfolding before my eyes.It soon became obvious to me that this movie was going to be one of the very best ever to be seen by my eyes.The abandonment of this beautiful little girl by her father, who lied to her, was soon to bring tears to these 73 year old eyes.The torment that she had to go through,forcibly having to live in an all girl orphanage, with many other young girls and the way she handles her situation, had me completly engrossed in this movie.When she was finally accepted for adoption by a French couple, it left me further wondering, just what her brand new life was going to bring her.A new family, a new mother, a new father, a new country, a new language, new house rules, new food.....everything that would be completely alien to her. Those things kept me asking myself, how will she make out, will she make it? She is clearly a very sad, yet a very intelligent little girl.Being abandoned by her father had brought the whole world upon her shoulders.We find out that her father, whom she loved very much, abandoned her, moved away from their home, to live with another woman.....their where-abouts unknown.I won't say anything more about this movie other than you really should buy this movie and I sincerely say that you will be very glad that you did.On the other hand, I have to add this to my story.Having seen the movie on my tv, when it finished, I went straight to this computer and checked if Amazon had it.They did. So I ordered it immediately. A week later, I discovered the movie on ""catch-up tv"".So, I was able to watch it a second time (and again and again, if I had wanted to).Eventually, my dvd arrived, via Thailand.Two nights later, I had the time to watch it.Eagerly, I put it into my dvd player.According to the information on the packaging, it was 90 minutes (approx) long.At 0ne hour and ten minutes, it began freezing momentarily and progressively, getting worse. To make matters even more worse, it was now being contaminated with pixilation which also continued to worsen. At 1.17 it was not possible to play it any further.Needless to say, I was more than a little angry at this disaster.I tried playing the disc on every one of my 13 dvd players.....all incurred the same problem.More than a little annoyed now, I immediately contacted the dealer in Thailand about this situation.I was delighted to get his reply.....within an hour!!!He appologised and promised to immediately send a free replacement disc.This he has apparently done, but at this time of writing, it has not yet arrived, no doubt due to the busy Xmas deliveries.I expect its arrival early January.I am very dismayed that my anxious wait for its arrival was marred by its poor disc production.I am hopeful that my replacement copy will bring happier results. We shall see.But, apart from this, it is truly a wonderful movie and I strongly urge you to buy, borrow, or beg to see it. Trully, you'll be glad you did.",5,"A wonderful, wonderful, but sad, movie.",1324771200,"12 25, 2011",2011,3277,"['One', 'day', 'recently', 'was', 'trolling', 'tv', 'channels', 'looking', 'something', 'watch.I', 'came', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'beginning.At', 'moment', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'about', 'what', 'had', 'store', 'me.As', 'continued', 'watch', 'movie', 'thankfully', 'English', 'subtitles', 'became', 'deeply', 'engrossed', 'what', 'was', 'unfolding', 'eyes.It', 'soon', 'became', 'obvious', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'ever', 'be', 'seen', 'eyes.The', 'abandonment', 'beautiful', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'who', 'lied', 'was', 'soon', 'bring', 'tears', '73', 'year', 'old', 'eyes.The', 'torment', 'had', 'go', 'forcibly', 'having', 'live', 'girl', 'orphanage', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'girls', 'way', 'situation', 'had', 'completly', 'engrossed', 'movie.When', 'was', 'finally', 'accepted', 'adoption', 'French', 'couple', 'left', 'further', 'wondering', 'just', 'what', 'brand', 'new', 'life', 'was', 'going', 'bring', 'her.A', 'new', 'family', 'new', 'mother', 'new', 'father', 'new', 'country', 'new', 'language', 'new', 'house', 'rules', 'new', 'food', '..everything', 'would', 'be', 'completely', 'alien', 'things', 'kept', 'asking', 'how', 'will', 'make', 'out', 'will', 'make', 'clearly', 'very', 'sad', 'yet', 'very', 'intelligent', 'little', 'girl.Being', 'abandoned', 'father', 'had', 'brought', 'whole', 'world', 'shoulders.We', 'find', 'out', 'father', 'whom', 'loved', 'very', 'much', 'abandoned', 'moved', 'away', 'home', 'live', 'woman', '..their', 'where-abouts', 'unknown.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'movie', 'other', 'really', 'should', 'buy', 'movie', 'sincerely', 'say', 'will', 'be', 'very', 'glad', 'did.On', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'add', 'story.Having', 'seen', 'movie', 'tv', 'when', 'finished', 'went', 'straight', 'computer', 'checked', 'Amazon', 'had', 'it.They', 'did', 'ordered', 'immediately', 'week', 'later', 'discovered', 'movie', 'catch-up', 'tv', '.So', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'again', 'again', 'had', 'wanted', '.Eventually', 'dvd', 'arrived', 'Thailand.Two', 'nights', 'later', 'had', 'time', 'watch', 'it.Eagerly', 'put', 'dvd', 'player.According', 'information', 'packaging', 'was', '90', 'minutes', 'approx', '0ne', 'hour', 'ten', 'minutes', 'began', 'freezing', 'momentarily', 'progressively', 'getting', 'worse', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'more', 'worse', 'was', 'now', 'being', 'contaminated', 'pixilation', 'also', 'continued', 'worsen', '1.17', 'was', 'not', 'possible', 'play', 'further.Needless', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'angry', 'disaster.I', 'tried', 'playing', 'disc', 'one', '13', 'dvd', 'players', '..all', 'incurred', 'same', 'problem.More', 'little', 'annoyed', 'now', 'immediately', 'contacted', 'dealer', 'Thailand', 'situation.I', 'was', 'delighted', 'get', 'reply', 'hour', 'appologised', 'promised', 'immediately', 'send', 'free', 'replacement', 'disc.This', 'apparently', 'done', 'time', 'writing', 'not', 'yet', 'arrived', 'doubt', 'due', 'busy', 'Xmas', 'deliveries.I', 'expect', 'arrival', 'early', 'January.I', 'am', 'very', 'dismayed', 'anxious', 'wait', 'arrival', 'was', 'marred', 'poor', 'disc', 'production.I', 'am', 'hopeful', 'replacement', 'copy', 'will', 'bring', 'happier', 'results', 'shall', 'see.But', 'apart', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'movie', 'strongly', 'urge', 'buy', 'borrow', 'beg', 'see', 'Trully', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did']",N/A
