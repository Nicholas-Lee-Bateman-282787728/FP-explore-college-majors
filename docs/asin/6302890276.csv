There was an aged man sitting at a desk holding a pistol in his hand and claimed it to be a &#8220;Peacemaker&#8221;. The only problem there was he was holding an 1875 Remington not a 1873 Colt &#8220;Peacemaker&#8221;. That was only the beginning of the gaffs in this film. At one point in the film the main characters were crossing a bleak landscape and on a hill in the background were a series of modern communication towers. I guess the viewers are just supposed to ignore such obvious historical errors. The gratuitous lengthy sex scene toward the end was really not needed and did nothing to solidify character development. Perhaps the scene was put in to arouse the young male teenage audience that this film was obviously aimed at.

344252,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,6302890276,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[0, 0]","While I liked this movie I found that it had pacing problems.The plot was spot on and so was the time period. There has never been a Western that took place in 1898. Indeed, the West was supposedly won by 1890. Despite this, there were still many cowboys roaming about the West.Mario Van Peebles is an incredible filmmaker. I liked his touch of adding the late great Woody Strode as an elderly man recounting the tale. I also liked how he included the late Stephen J. Cannell as a gambler in the movie. That was a nod to the producer for his starting Van Peeble's career in the 1980s. Sonny Spoon was the vehicle that got Van Peebles on the map.Unfortunately by the end of the movie most of the characters are killed. I felt this detracted from the movie's feeling. Stephen Baldwin and Tone Loc were good, but they were inexplicably killed off. Tone Loc was killed in New Orleans and his &#34;friends&#34; just abandoned him in order to chase after Mario Van Peeble's character. What kind of friends were they?Overall, I give this film a Three and a Half Star rating. If you like Westerns you may like this film.A.

I thought  the movie was very entertaining and despite the negative reviews who say the acting horrible i thought the actors did as well as many of those who are winning academy awards these days.The only flaw the movie has in my opinion is the music portrayed in the movie as we all know we did not sing like that back in those days however i am NOT ASHAMED of the sountrack (as one reviewer suggest i should be)but instead i am VERY PROUD of intelligent hoodlum singing of posse.Last but not least for the reviewer who stated that it is not like Kirk Douglas""s posse well that""s because it is NOT KIRK DOUGLAS""S POSSE i mean really you talk about a movie called posse being about duptiesing and arming men to go out and seek bad men.Do you really think back in those days they would really do that to a man of color? I mean really are not all colored men criminals themselves?

Unlike the shallow and silly ""Rosewood"" Van Peebles ""Posse"" gives viewers a clear picture of what life was like for African-American cowboys at the turn of the century. We get to know characters in the story. The production values are low budget, and several roles are miscast, but Van Peebles' heart is in every second of this film. He loves the material and wants us to learn as much about these forgotten black heroes as he has. Part ""spaghetti western"", part action flick, part historical drama, Posse is a lot of fun to watch. Mario Van Peebles, Billy Zane, Melvin Van Peebles and Salli Richardson in her first role are great. Tis one is worth owining for your collection.",4,A popcorn movie that teaches.

The officer (Billy Zane) had the posse steal some gold from Cuba during the Spanish-American War. He planned to kill them afterwards, but the group proved stronger than he thought and they escaped. They come back to the states and follow Jesse (Van Peebles) to the dream town of his deceased father in west Texas. Jesse has some inner demons to silence and they won't be still until he has settled an aged score.The film is interesting.
