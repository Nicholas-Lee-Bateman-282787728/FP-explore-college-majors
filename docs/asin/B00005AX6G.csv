579424,A2FE8EIEGNWC41,B00005AX6G,"Adam Cole ""Ministry of Silly Walks""","[6, 9]","That's the conclusion I came to while watching The Claim. I have not yet read The Mayor of Casterbridge, but Winterbottom's frigid Sierra adaptation left me cold, and not in the intended sense.  What could easily have been a compelling film was thwarted by its own presentation. I lost count of the excruciating, wooden attempts at accompanied singing and poetry recitation I was forced to endure at full length, where just a sampling would have sufficed. The portrayals here tend to hold us at arms length, as we watch the characters go through the fate-driven motions of their dreary Gold Rush existence. Hope (Sarah Polley) in particular is so flat and lifeless and underdeveloped that setting her up as a romantic interest lacked credibility.I welcome subtlety, but here plot comprehension is fatally hindered by technical problems. Seen in flashbacks, the younger versions of characters bear scant resemblance to their latter-day counterparts. More than once, the idiosyncratic camera blurring had me shouting ""Focus!!!"" in frustration (although the rest of the cinematography is beautiful). Important figures like Dillon have thick accents, and their intelligibility was not improved by the omnipresent background noise and obtrusive scoring with which the director gleefully assaults us. Whistling winds, squalling infants, noisy saloon ambiance, and horribly out-of-tune pianos all conspire to drown out dialogue, and when these are lacking, an emotionally overwrought score swells to take their place. I had to infer Dillon's lines because I couldn't understand a word he said. If I were Sheriff, the sort of frontier justice exemplified in this film would be summarily applied to studios who can't be bothered to include ENGLISH SUBTITLES on their dvd releases! There's just no excuse for this.Ultimately, all the above makes me wish I had just retired to the davenport with a cup of tea and Hardy's novel, and spared myself the myriad annoyances of this film.  Still, it's an earnest and laudable attempt at serious drama, beautifully shot, with a fine, moving story underlying it.  If you're willing to deal with the aspects I found alienating, it will probably be worth your time to watch The Claim.",3,Michael Winterbottom hates me.,1043625600,"01 27, 2003",2003,2212,"['conclusion', 'came', 'watching', 'Claim', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'Winterbottom', 'frigid', 'Sierra', 'adaptation', 'left', 'cold', 'not', 'intended', 'sense', 'What', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'compelling', 'film', 'was', 'thwarted', 'own', 'presentation', 'lost', 'count', 'excruciating', 'wooden', 'attempts', 'accompanied', 'singing', 'poetry', 'recitation', 'was', 'forced', 'endure', 'full', 'length', 'where', 'just', 'sampling', 'would', 'have', 'sufficed', 'portrayals', 'here', 'tend', 'hold', 'arms', 'length', 'watch', 'characters', 'go', 'fate-driven', 'motions', 'dreary', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'existence', 'Hope', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'particular', 'so', 'flat', 'lifeless', 'underdeveloped', 'setting', 'up', 'romantic', 'interest', 'lacked', 'credibility.I', 'welcome', 'subtlety', 'here', 'plot', 'comprehension', 'fatally', 'hindered', 'technical', 'problems', 'Seen', 'flashbacks', 'younger', 'versions', 'characters', 'bear', 'scant', 'resemblance', 'latter-day', 'counterparts', 'More', 'once', 'idiosyncratic', 'camera', 'blurring', 'had', 'shouting', 'Focus', 'frustration', 'rest', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'Important', 'figures', 'Dillon', 'have', 'thick', 'accents', 'intelligibility', 'was', 'not', 'improved', 'omnipresent', 'background', 'noise', 'obtrusive', 'scoring', 'director', 'gleefully', 'assaults', 'Whistling', 'winds', 'squalling', 'infants', 'noisy', 'saloon', 'ambiance', 'horribly', 'out-of-tune', 'pianos', 'conspire', 'drown', 'out', 'dialogue', 'when', 'are', 'lacking', 'emotionally', 'overwrought', 'score', 'swells', 'take', 'place', 'had', 'infer', 'Dillon', 'lines', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'said', 'were', 'Sheriff', 'sort', 'frontier', 'justice', 'exemplified', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'summarily', 'applied', 'studios', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'include', 'ENGLISH', 'SUBTITLES', 'dvd', 'just', 'excuse', 'this.Ultimately', 'above', 'wish', 'had', 'just', 'retired', 'davenport', 'cup', 'tea', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'spared', 'myriad', 'annoyances', 'film', 'Still', 'earnest', 'laudable', 'attempt', 'serious', 'drama', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'fine', 'moving', 'story', 'underlying', ""'re"", 'willing', 'deal', 'aspects', 'found', 'alienating', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'time', 'watch', 'Claim']",N/A

579427,AEVNUEDRGTC4P,B00005AX6G,Charles J. Rector,"[4, 8]","The Claim purports to be an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge transplanted to the Old West. The producers clearly wanted The Claim to be accepted as a literate Western and it is clear that the critics fell for it. However, as anyone who has read the original Hardy novel can tell you, the movie fails as a Hardy adaptation. Meanwhile, any fan of movie westerns can tell you that The Claim is a failure in that department as well.The Claim begins in 1869 where Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan) lords supreme over his company town. His gold mining company is a topflight operation. Dillon is easily one of the most admired men in California, if not in the nation. However, Dillon is not a terribly happy man. Deep down, he broods over a dark secret that, if exposed, could lead to the destruction of his reputation.You see, the gold claim was originally made by another man, but Dillon sold his wife and daughter to the original claimant in exchange for the claim. The prospector thereupon took both wife and child to Boston and raised the family there. Meanwhile, Dillon ruthlessly exploited the gold claim to become one of the richest men in all of California. Needless to say, if it became public knowldege that Dillon's success was based on the sale of human beings, that would be nothing short of disastrous.Matters are brought to a head when his wife (Nastassja Kinski), daughter (Milla Jovovich) and his wife's subsequent daughter with the other man (Sarah Polley) show up in town and request that he take them in as his family. Just when you think that things are going to get interesting, the rug is pulled out from the audience's feet when it is revealed that Dillon conveniently never married after making his dirty deal. This enabled him to marry his ex-wife without never having to publically admit that they were previously married or what happened to that union. This effectively removed all dramatic tension and helped make The Claim a colossal bore.",1,Worthless Western,1176940800,"04 19, 2007",2007,1996,"['Claim', 'purports', 'be', 'adaptation', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'classic', 'novel', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'transplanted', 'Old', 'West', 'producers', 'clearly', 'wanted', 'Claim', 'be', 'accepted', 'literate', 'Western', 'clear', 'critics', 'fell', 'However', 'anyone', 'who', 'read', 'original', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'can', 'tell', 'movie', 'Hardy', 'adaptation', 'Meanwhile', 'fan', 'movie', 'westerns', 'can', 'tell', 'Claim', 'failure', 'department', 'well.The', 'Claim', '1869', 'where', 'Daniel', 'Dillon', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'lords', 'supreme', 'company', 'town', 'gold', 'mining', 'company', 'topflight', 'operation', 'Dillon', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'admired', 'men', 'California', 'not', 'nation', 'However', 'Dillon', 'not', 'terribly', 'happy', 'man', 'Deep', 'down', 'dark', 'secret', 'exposed', 'could', 'lead', 'destruction', 'reputation.You', 'see', 'gold', 'claim', 'was', 'originally', 'made', 'man', 'Dillon', 'sold', 'wife', 'daughter', 'original', 'claimant', 'exchange', 'claim', 'prospector', 'thereupon', 'took', 'wife', 'child', 'Boston', 'raised', 'family', 'there', 'Meanwhile', 'Dillon', 'ruthlessly', 'exploited', 'gold', 'claim', 'become', 'one', 'richest', 'men', 'California', 'Needless', 'say', 'became', 'public', 'knowldege', 'Dillon', 'success', 'was', 'based', 'sale', 'human', 'beings', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'short', 'disastrous.Matters', 'are', 'brought', 'head', 'when', 'wife', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'daughter', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'wife', 'subsequent', 'daughter', 'other', 'man', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'show', 'up', 'town', 'request', 'take', 'family', 'Just', 'when', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'interesting', 'rug', 'pulled', 'out', 'audience', 'feet', 'when', 'revealed', 'Dillon', 'conveniently', 'never', 'married', 'making', 'dirty', 'deal', 'enabled', 'marry', 'ex-wife', 'never', 'having', 'publically', 'admit', 'were', 'previously', 'married', 'what', 'happened', 'union', 'effectively', 'removed', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'helped', 'make', 'Claim', 'colossal', 'bore']",N/A

579435,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B00005AX6G,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Snow.  1869: a bustling town in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.Muted tones, frenetic editing, the juxtaposition of a stark hotel room then a bar glitzy with candle light, a singer (Milla Jovovich) belts out a tune, a man is whipped outside; who or what are we expected to focus on, the camera doesn't rest anywhere long enough.  Nonetheless, this is an oddly engrossing film about one man (Peter Mullan) and his dream/scheme to have the railroad run through his town.  He's rich but would like to increase his wealth and power.  While he's busy wooing the recently arrived railroad surveyors two women show up in town, ultimately complicating everything.  Not really a mystery, not a treatise on greed or the abuse of power, blind ambition, jealousy or the like.  Things happen during the time period identified and that's that; take it or leave it.What makes this an odd film is that while it is a fascinating story, it's also cold and detached and (purposely?) aloof.  The scenes are choppy, bouncing around with little regard to structure, highlighting a few people and not much action.  Several important clues/flashbacks are included in such a way as to distort time.  It's easy to mistake them for what was currently happening; only later realizing their full importance.  There's an ""a-ha"" moment that's rather apathetic.  Once everyone reaches the same conclusion, it's met with little excitement.  Because, the other odd thing about this film is its complete lack of passion.  Everything is matter of fact, whether it's the last fling with a prostitute or the killing of a man or two.  It's as if everyone is simply too cold to show any enthusiasm.  An example: there's an explosion and a horse runs off in flames, there is no surprise but there should be; it's all too casual.I will say that it held my attention throughout but once it was over and hindsight had set in I instantly felt no lasting regard for it, preserving the films reserved tone.Not a film I'd ever want to see again, glad I saw it, but it's not a keeper.",3,Kingdom Come,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,2031,"['Snow', '1869', 'bustling', 'town', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'Mountains.Muted', 'tones', 'frenetic', 'editing', 'juxtaposition', 'stark', 'hotel', 'room', 'then', 'bar', 'glitzy', 'candle', 'light', 'singer', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'out', 'tune', 'man', 'whipped', 'who', 'what', 'are', 'expected', 'focus', 'camera', ""n't"", 'rest', 'anywhere', 'long', 'enough', 'Nonetheless', 'oddly', 'engrossing', 'film', 'one', 'man', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'dream/scheme', 'have', 'railroad', 'run', 'town', 'rich', 'would', 'like', 'increase', 'wealth', 'power', 'busy', 'wooing', 'recently', 'arrived', 'railroad', 'surveyors', 'two', 'women', 'show', 'up', 'town', 'ultimately', 'complicating', 'everything', 'Not', 'really', 'mystery', 'not', 'treatise', 'greed', 'abuse', 'power', 'blind', 'ambition', 'jealousy', 'like', 'Things', 'happen', 'time', 'period', 'identified', 'take', 'leave', 'odd', 'film', 'fascinating', 'story', 'also', 'cold', 'detached', 'purposely', 'aloof', 'scenes', 'are', 'choppy', 'bouncing', 'around', 'little', 'regard', 'structure', 'highlighting', 'few', 'people', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'Several', 'important', 'clues/flashbacks', 'are', 'included', 'such', 'way', 'distort', 'time', 'easy', 'mistake', 'what', 'was', 'currently', 'happening', 'only', 'later', 'realizing', 'full', 'importance', 'a-ha', 'moment', 'rather', 'apathetic', 'Once', 'everyone', 'same', 'conclusion', 'met', 'little', 'excitement', 'other', 'odd', 'thing', 'film', 'complete', 'lack', 'passion', 'Everything', 'matter', 'fact', 'last', 'fling', 'prostitute', 'killing', 'man', 'two', 'everyone', 'simply', 'too', 'cold', 'show', 'enthusiasm', 'example', 'explosion', 'horse', 'off', 'flames', 'surprise', 'should', 'be', 'too', 'casual.I', 'will', 'say', 'held', 'attention', 'was', 'over', 'hindsight', 'had', 'set', 'instantly', 'felt', 'lasting', 'regard', 'preserving', 'films', 'reserved', 'tone.Not', 'film', ""'d"", 'ever', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'glad', 'saw', 'not', 'keeper']",N/A

Similar in tone to DAYS OF HEAVEN, another bit of American history, THE CLAIM is told in unsentimental bleak fact; nobody is spared, and there are no real winners except the railroad.Daniel Dillon arrives in the wilds of Northern California during the gold rush with his wife and infant daughter in hopes of making a fortune in the gold fields. They arrive at a claim shack, cold, hungry, and out of hope and are taken in by the claimer, and in short order, Dillon unsentimentally sells his family to the lonely miner for the claim. The wife, Elena, aware that she has little say, goes with her new master, but does not close the door on Dillon.Years later, we find that Dillon has made a go of things with his claim; he has built a town called Kingdom Come, wrested out of the mountains virtually by himself, a rough-and-ready place without amenities beyond the ubiquitous saloon and whorehouse to supply the miners. A survey crew appears; negotiations are begun to possibly bring the newly-constructed railroad through Kingdom Come and establish Dillon as the baron he envisions himself to be. The survey crew brings with it, however, a nasty shock for him; his erstwhile wife and now-grown daughter - who is unaware that Dillon is her father. Elena - the wife - is dying; she has come back to make some sort of arrangement with Dillon, as the man she was sold to has died and left her destitute, and she wants to provide for her daughter, the unlikely-named Hope. Dillon, on seeing her, realizes suddenly that his ambitions have left him hollow; his closest association is the madam of the town bordello, who loves him, but who he has no intention of marrying. He unceremoniously dumps the madam and presents Elena with an offer she can't refuse, and they are married - despite already being married - before all the townsfolk and move into a - for a town like that - palatial house overlooking his mountain fiefdom.Both Hope and the madam view all this with equal suspicion and disapproval. Hope is aware that some connection is involved of which she is ignorant; the madam is deeply angry at being shunted off like yesterday's news. The survey company comes periodically into town for refreshment, always greeted enthusiastically by the girls from the bordello, played just right with a brittle gaiety and hope by the cast of women; you can see the wavering despair of one in particular, hopelessly in love with her regular customer and played to the pathos of hoping against hope that he will return each time and maybe, MAYBE spirit her away from Kingdom Come some day. The town itself is crude and unapologetic; no church or school, totally utilitarian, without sidewalks or a good road. Dillon's hopes of the coming railroad elevating the town are clearly laid out in his efforts to sway the survey crew, but his dreams of dynasty - and of leaving it all to Hope, the daughter he abandoned and regained - lie in the hands and at the mercy of the railroad company.There is nothing soft or romantic about this movie; it is told in real-life format. People make choices that are wrong or right and pay the consequences thereof. There is no silver lining here; frontier life was hard and nasty sometimes, and this makes that very clear. Nothing came easy in the Old West, and justice was meted out unofficially and with speed. There were no second chances here.This movie got under my skin almost immediately. It is shot in winter, for one thing; I was cold the whole time I watched it, merely from suggestion. The performances are top-rate; Wes Bentley - a young man I was previously unfamiliar with - plays the chief surveyist with careful consideration of his surroundings, sizing up every situation; Hope, played by Sarah Polley, shows just the right mix of doubt and loyalty as a daughter; her mother, played sublimely by the legendary Nastassja Kinski, faces her slow death bravely and accepts the life she was given.Daniel Dillon, played by Peter Mullan, takes his role as the king of Kingdom Come and makes it believeable, with equal parts of strength, bravado, and regret for mistakes made.This was not a big movie; I'd never heard of it until I chanced on it, but it was a worthwhile couple of hours' insight into the life of a frontier mining town near the end of the 1800s West. And the scenery can be pretty awesome also.",5,cold truth,1162684800,"11 5, 2006",2006,4416,"['West', 'imagine', 'actually', 'was', 'rough', 'unrefined', 'brutal', 'Similar', 'tone', 'DAYS', 'OF', 'HEAVEN', 'bit', 'American', 'history', 'THE', 'CLAIM', 'told', 'unsentimental', 'bleak', 'fact', 'nobody', 'spared', 'are', 'real', 'winners', 'railroad.Daniel', 'Dillon', 'wilds', 'Northern', 'California', 'gold', 'rush', 'wife', 'infant', 'daughter', 'hopes', 'making', 'fortune', 'gold', 'fields', 'arrive', 'claim', 'shack', 'cold', 'hungry', 'hope', 'are', 'taken', 'claimer', 'short', 'order', 'Dillon', 'unsentimentally', 'family', 'lonely', 'miner', 'claim', 'wife', 'Elena', 'aware', 'little', 'say', 'new', 'master', 'not', 'close', 'door', 'Dillon.Years', 'later', 'find', 'Dillon', 'made', 'go', 'things', 'claim', 'built', 'town', 'called', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'wrested', 'mountains', 'virtually', 'rough-and-ready', 'place', 'amenities', 'ubiquitous', 'saloon', 'whorehouse', 'supply', 'miners', 'survey', 'crew', 'negotiations', 'are', 'begun', 'possibly', 'bring', 'newly-constructed', 'railroad', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'establish', 'Dillon', 'baron', 'be', 'survey', 'crew', 'brings', 'however', 'nasty', 'shock', 'erstwhile', 'wife', 'now-grown', 'daughter', 'who', 'unaware', 'Dillon', 'father', 'Elena', 'wife', 'dying', 'come', 'back', 'make', 'sort', 'arrangement', 'Dillon', 'man', 'was', 'sold', 'died', 'left', 'destitute', 'provide', 'daughter', 'unlikely-named', 'Hope', 'Dillon', 'seeing', 'suddenly', 'ambitions', 'have', 'left', 'hollow', 'closest', 'association', 'madam', 'town', 'bordello', 'who', 'who', 'intention', 'marrying', 'unceremoniously', 'madam', 'presents', 'Elena', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'are', 'married', 'already', 'being', 'married', 'townsfolk', 'move', 'town', 'palatial', 'house', 'overlooking', 'mountain', 'Hope', 'madam', 'view', 'equal', 'suspicion', 'disapproval', 'Hope', 'aware', 'connection', 'involved', 'ignorant', 'madam', 'deeply', 'angry', 'being', 'shunted', 'yesterday', 'news', 'survey', 'company', 'periodically', 'town', 'refreshment', 'always', 'greeted', 'enthusiastically', 'girls', 'bordello', 'played', 'just', 'right', 'brittle', 'gaiety', 'hope', 'cast', 'women', 'can', 'see', 'wavering', 'despair', 'one', 'particular', 'hopelessly', 'love', 'regular', 'customer', 'played', 'pathos', 'hoping', 'hope', 'will', 'return', 'time', 'maybe', 'MAYBE', 'spirit', 'away', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'day', 'town', 'crude', 'unapologetic', 'church', 'school', 'totally', 'utilitarian', 'sidewalks', 'good', 'road', 'Dillon', 'hopes', 'coming', 'railroad', 'elevating', 'town', 'are', 'clearly', 'laid', 'out', 'efforts', 'sway', 'survey', 'crew', 'dreams', 'dynasty', 'leaving', 'Hope', 'daughter', 'abandoned', 'regained', 'lie', 'hands', 'mercy', 'railroad', 'nothing', 'soft', 'romantic', 'movie', 'told', 'real-life', 'format', 'People', 'make', 'choices', 'are', 'wrong', 'right', 'pay', 'consequences', 'thereof', 'silver', 'lining', 'here', 'frontier', 'life', 'was', 'hard', 'nasty', 'sometimes', 'very', 'clear', 'Nothing', 'came', 'easy', 'Old', 'West', 'justice', 'was', 'meted', 'out', 'unofficially', 'speed', 'were', 'second', 'chances', 'here.This', 'movie', 'got', 'skin', 'almost', 'immediately', 'shot', 'winter', 'one', 'thing', 'was', 'cold', 'whole', 'time', 'watched', 'merely', 'suggestion', 'performances', 'are', 'top-rate', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'young', 'man', 'was', 'previously', 'unfamiliar', 'chief', 'surveyist', 'careful', 'consideration', 'surroundings', 'sizing', 'up', 'situation', 'Hope', 'played', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'just', 'right', 'mix', 'doubt', 'loyalty', 'daughter', 'mother', 'played', 'sublimely', 'legendary', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'slow', 'death', 'bravely', 'life', 'was', 'given.Daniel', 'Dillon', 'played', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'role', 'king', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'believeable', 'equal', 'parts', 'strength', 'bravado', 'regret', 'mistakes', 'made.This', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'movie', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'chanced', 'was', 'worthwhile', 'couple', 'hours', 'insight', 'life', 'frontier', 'mining', 'town', 'end', '1800s', 'West', 'scenery', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'awesome', 'also']",N/A

The narrative of the film does not reveal itself very clearly. I even had read the novel (""The Mayor of Casterbridge"") by Thomas Hardy on which the film was based (with a transfer from a British to an American Western setting, with changes in the names of the characters), but had read that great work too long ago to be able to recall enough of it to follow clearly what the film, too, was portraying. I did manage to ""get the gist of it"" despite a lot of confusion along the way, but it was a summary of the action of the motion picture, on a WWW site that made it all congeal together, ""after the fact"" of having viewed it, rather than adequate clues of a visual sort or from the dialogue from the movie itself while I first was watching it.The film is visually very beautiful. The mountainous California scenery is magnificent and rather well and atmospherically filmed. The young male actor, Wes Bentley, who plays the role of Dalglish, the railroad planner, provides the main human pulchritude, very handsome and youtfully appealing, real ""eye candy"". His acting is less than stunning, perhaps at least in part due to the apparent need to affect a foreign accent that he conveys with only intermittent ability to convince. One of the problems, though, that this film has with conveying the narrative is that so much attention on the character of Dalglish (Bentley), especially so near to the beginning of the movie, distracts the viewer's attention from the plight (until revived later as the action progresses) of Daniel Dillon (played by Peter Mullan), who, after all, is the central character around whose fate this cinematic work turns. What occurs in flashbacks to the past and what is happening in the action's present also is unclear, creating potential confusion for the viewer.The film might have benefitted from a better and more assertive musical score. Too much happens without the evocative enhancement that a more skillful and prominent score would have provided.A good motion picture this is, in short, but do some ""homework"" to prepare yourself to follow the story that this film recounts with such visual beauty.

579440,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,B00005AX6G,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[23, 24]","One of the most remarkable adaptations of a literary work I've seen. Frank Cottrell Boyce completely changes Thomas Hardy's classic The Mayor of Casterbridge - and actually betters it lifting it from its original setting and tailoring it into a tale of the American West during the Gold Rush.  Some of Hardy's holes hold (predictable) difficulty for many modern readers, but Boyce's western retelling fills them in and lends strong plausibility.  (There's a tad too much ""faint, fall ill and die"" for me in the Hardy original).  Some have complained that Boyce went too far - but this is a movie ""based"" on the book not claiming to be a faithful retelling.Director Michael Winterbottom proves to have an enormous eye emerging in bold style at once stylized and natural.  He brings us here images that, once seen, burn, linger and haunt forever be it a Victorian mansion hauled across the frozen plains or a horse's immolation as on fire it gallops across the screen.Winterbottom's cast is a strong one - none remaining as they initially seem, each changing before our eyes. Kinski, first strong and bitter gives one of her most tender heartbreaking performances, Wes Bentley, likeable and promising becomes petty and meddlesome. Milla Jovovich serves up, predictably, hearty and hot, yet more delicate than she would like to appear.In all of this Peter Mullan's Daniel Dillon is the focus and the fulcrum by which the story hinges.  He is never less than masterful.  To see him early on nearly ravaged by youthful greed then watch him in age yearn for salvation that may never come or come too late, one cannot help but be riveted by his endeavor to make up by his plight and his attempt to change it.The Claim is a remarkable film which, while it may take a bit of time to warm up to, burns its own unique reward in a way few modern Hollywood films can.",4,A Hardy Spin on the American Western,1099958400,"11 9, 2004",2004,1854,"['One', 'most', 'remarkable', 'adaptations', 'literary', 'work', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'completely', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'classic', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'actually', 'betters', 'lifting', 'original', 'setting', 'tailoring', 'tale', 'American', 'West', 'Gold', 'Rush', 'Hardy', 'holes', 'hold', 'predictable', 'difficulty', 'many', 'modern', 'readers', 'Boyce', 'western', 'retelling', 'fills', 'strong', 'plausibility', 'tad', 'too', 'much', 'faint', 'fall', 'ill', 'die', 'Hardy', 'original', 'have', 'complained', 'Boyce', 'went', 'too', 'far', 'movie', 'based', 'book', 'not', 'claiming', 'be', 'faithful', 'retelling.Director', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'have', 'enormous', 'eye', 'emerging', 'bold', 'style', 'once', 'stylized', 'natural', 'here', 'once', 'seen', 'burn', 'linger', 'haunt', 'forever', 'be', 'Victorian', 'mansion', 'hauled', 'frozen', 'plains', 'horse', 'immolation', 'fire', 'screen.Winterbottom', 'cast', 'strong', 'one', 'none', 'remaining', 'initially', 'seem', 'changing', 'eyes', 'Kinski', 'first', 'strong', 'bitter', 'one', 'most', 'tender', 'heartbreaking', 'performances', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'likeable', 'promising', 'becomes', 'petty', 'meddlesome', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'up', 'predictably', 'hearty', 'hot', 'yet', 'more', 'delicate', 'would', 'like', 'appear.In', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'Daniel', 'Dillon', 'focus', 'fulcrum', 'story', 'hinges', 'never', 'less', 'masterful', 'see', 'early', 'nearly', 'ravaged', 'youthful', 'greed', 'then', 'watch', 'age', 'yearn', 'salvation', 'may', 'never', 'come', 'come', 'too', 'late', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'be', 'riveted', 'endeavor', 'make', 'up', 'plight', 'attempt', 'change', 'it.The', 'Claim', 'remarkable', 'film', 'may', 'take', 'bit', 'time', 'warm', 'up', 'burns', 'own', 'unique', 'reward', 'way', 'few', 'modern', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'can']",N/A

579443,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005AX6G,Joseph Haschka,"[0, 2]","""There's no pleasure in it. A man loses heart""Such is the admonition about gold that a weary prospector, after pouring a bag of nuggets out onto the table, gives young Daniel Dillon, newly arrived in the snowbound Sierra Nevada range during the California gold rush. Despite this less than encouraging counsel, Dillon trades for the miner's claim something most men would consider too dear to barter. Now, almost two decades later in 1868, Daniel's mine has spawned a town, Kingdom Come, and Dillon (Peter Mullan) is the benevolent despot that rules the settlement and everyone in it. Again, it's winter, and there's nothing for the prospectors to do but drink, gamble, carouse in the local brothel, and await the verdict of the Central Pacific survey party out to determine if the transcontinental trains will pass through KC. It's not too much of an exaggeration to say that the town will die if the railroad bypasses the community.Wes Bentley plays Donald Dalglish, the rakish young engineer who leads the survey team. He's arrived in town escorting two ladies, recently widowed Elena (Nastassja Kinski) and Hope (Sarah Polley). Elena is dying of tuberculosis, and Hope is her teenaged daughter. It soon becomes apparent that the two women share a past with Dillon, who dumps Lucia, his significant other and the owner of the brothel, and invites Elena and Hope to move into his Victorian mansion. In the meantime, between frolics with the workin' gals, Dalglish becomes smitten with Hope.The connection between Dillon, Elena and Hope is revealed early on. The plot is not so much concerned with who these characters are, but rather with the culmination of the morality play that began years before when Dillon ignored sound advice - a finale intensified to a sharp point by the Central Pacific's eventual verdict and Elena's illness.I was somewhat confounded that I didn't like this movie more for it's indeed a richly photographed period piece. For me, the characters of Dillon and Dalglish just didn't click. Neither one was portrayed by the screenwriters to be either particularly endearing or hateful to the audience. Both are just regular guys, each a blend of both good and flawed traits, and therefore too nondescript to carry the weight of being the male leads. The Elena and Hope characters, while crucial to the storyline, were little more than indispensable props.Actually, the most interesting part of the film for me - and I'm saying this without a smirk, really! - was the portrayal of the bordello. The film doesn't judge or glamorize the girls or the business they work at, which is to provide lonely men with emergency love and separate them from their money and gold in the process.

But where the film succeeds is not as a literary adaptation, but as a modern-day Western.Daniel Dillon (the terrific up-and-coming Scottish actor Peter Mullan)runs the western town of Kingdom Come with an iron fist and a kind of frontier justice.  Not only is he the law, but he in fact owns the town.  Coming to own the town, however, means that he sacrificed his wife and child many years earlier (this is told in flashback).Now that wife and child have returned to town to exact a price from Dillon--his former wife (Natassja Kinski, who is quite good) and child, Hope (Sarah Polley, so good in &quot;Sweet Hereafter&quot;) need money so that his wife can live out the remainder of her days comfortably.Without revealing too much of the plot, Hope soon becomes entangled with a railroad surveyor, Dalglish (Wes Bentley of &quot;American Beauty&quot;) who will determine the fate and future of Kingdom Come by telling the government where to put the railroad.Along for the ride is Milla Jovovich (&quot;Fifth Element&quot;), the clear weak link of the cast, who plays Dillon's mistress and the owner of the town brothel.The movie is an interesting character study, and while it has its slow moments, explores several classic Western themes:  love, money, greed and revenge.

While it's set in the Sierra-Nevadas at the time of the building of the railroad, and the heroines do more trudging through the snow than picking their way over the heath, the movie stays true to the essence, if not the setting of Hardy's work.I thought the casting was excellent.  There are no ""Western"" stereotypes here.  The saloon girls are not ravishing, but have a certain earthy quality.  And even Nastassja Kinski looks convincingly tuburcular. Also, in an era when movies play fast and loose with history, this does an amazing job of portraying the times realistically.  For example, most of the characters are foreign immigrants or children of immigrants, and the ""town"" is made up of slip-shod wooden structures, not the Gunsmoke type set we're used to seeing.However, the movie did have its flaws.  It does not, for example, tell the whole Casterbridge story. This would not be a problem, except that I got the impression that, running too long, the screenplay was cut somewhere in the middle, and then the ending was spliced on.  Also, there are some scenes that could use some follow-up but go nowhere.  And my teen-age daughter,who didn't know the story (but who suprisingly usually shares my taste in films) got bored with it.  She felt the plot was hard to follow, and the story was a little flat.All in all, however, if you are the type of person who appreciates a well-made movie over a blockbuster, or enjoys history, I'd say it's worth seeing.",4,Stays true to the essence of the novel,997488000,"08 11, 2001",2001,1594,"['Based', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'Mayor', 'Casterbrige', 'film', 'use', 'landscape', 'way', 'would', 'make', 'author', 'proud', 'set', 'Sierra-Nevadas', 'time', 'building', 'railroad', 'heroines', 'do', 'more', 'trudging', 'snow', 'picking', 'way', 'heath', 'movie', 'true', 'essence', 'not', 'setting', 'Hardy', 'work.I', 'thought', 'casting', 'was', 'excellent', 'are', 'Western', 'stereotypes', 'here', 'saloon', 'girls', 'are', 'not', 'ravishing', 'have', 'certain', 'earthy', 'quality', 'even', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'convincingly', 'tuburcular', 'Also', 'era', 'when', 'movies', 'play', 'fast', 'loose', 'history', 'amazing', 'job', 'portraying', 'times', 'realistically', 'example', 'most', 'characters', 'are', 'foreign', 'immigrants', 'children', 'immigrants', 'town', 'made', 'slip-shod', 'wooden', 'structures', 'not', 'Gunsmoke', 'type', 'set', ""'re"", 'used', 'seeing.However', 'movie', 'did', 'have', 'flaws', 'not', 'example', 'tell', 'whole', 'Casterbridge', 'story', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'problem', 'got', 'impression', 'running', 'too', 'long', 'screenplay', 'was', 'cut', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'then', 'ending', 'was', 'spliced', 'Also', 'are', 'scenes', 'could', 'use', 'follow-up', 'go', 'nowhere', 'teen-age', 'daughter', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'story', 'who', 'suprisingly', 'usually', 'shares', 'taste', 'films', 'got', 'bored', 'felt', 'plot', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'story', 'was', 'little', 'flat.All', 'however', 'are', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'well-made', 'movie', 'blockbuster', 'history', ""'d"", 'say', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

This brings Wes Bentley to survey the surrounding area to determine if the railroad will be built through the town.  It is very important for the founder of Kingdom Com, Daniel Dillon(Peter Mulan) because the town will flounder if the railroad is built elsewhere.  Also arriving at the same time are Hope Burns(Sara Polley) and her dying mother, Elena(Nastassja Kinski), they have some other business with Mr. Dillon.  As the story unfolds it becomes apparent that there is more to this set up then there originally seems.So, what did I like about this film?  Mostly everything, well shot, well edited, above average acting, decent pacing, it is a well made picture.  What didn't I like about this film?  Well the title for starters, but more importantly the story.  I did not care for most of the plot developments, which is just my personal opinion.  The subplots also tended to the &quot;I don't care&quot; catigory and I thought they hurt the overall pacing.  There were however a lot of little things I enjoyed about this movie.  The acting was all top notch.  And it had to be because Michael Winterbottom, the director, likes to use the close up as much as he can get away with.  Mullan was especially good as was Kinski.  Bentley and Polley had magnetic chemistry, but it was subtle which I really liked.  Milla Jovovich turns in what is probably the finest work of her career(except for the singing).I also liked how Winterbottom chose to use changes in focus as scene transitions.All in all I enjoyed this film.

This kept me so busy, translating, though, that I gave up after about 40 minutes.I think that if it had looked more interesting I might have kept at it, but it didn't.  The director was going for ""bleak"" it seems and he got it.  Sarah Polley who seemed to be a lead actor in the beginning was so pale and her voice was so blah that I had a hard time watching her.  The young male lead was equally uninteresting.  The older man (Peter Mullan?) and Mila Jovavich were much livelier, but it still wasn't enough for me.  The scenery was beautiful, but as another reviewer wrote, you could get that in The National Geographic. When a particularly spectacular snowy scene was shown, the music amped up as if to tell you that this was really a spectacular scene!  The scenes in the bar and brothel were repetitions of many other Old West films.  All of this was done sooo much better in McCabe and Mrs. Miler!The plot sounds interesting which makes sense since it's based on a novel by Thomas Hardy.

Zwick,"[3, 4]","Although set in a remote Sierra Nevada mining town in 1867, &#65533;The Claim&#65533; is really Thomas Hardy&#65533;s classic novel, &#65533;The Mayor of Casterbridge&#65533; transported to American soil.  The move is a good one.The story concerns a wealthy miner named Daniel Dillon who practically runs the town of Kingdom Come as his own personal fiefdom.  One fateful day three groups of people arrive into town:  some railroad surveyors who offer the possibility that a train may soon be passing through the town, bringing with it people, wealth and prosperity; some prostitutes who plan to open up shop in this all-male community; and a sickly woman and her beautiful young daughter, who, it turns out, are the wife and daughter that Dillon sold for a bag of gold in his desperate youth &#65533; a decision he has lived to rue ever since.Given this multi-character canvas, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and director Michael Winterbottom take an almost painterly approach, allowing the drama to unfold at an unhurried pace, so that they can concentrate on the bleak snowy winter setting which ends up playing as great a role in the drama as the characters themselves.  The most compelling of these is Dillon, a figure of almost tragic proportions, a man who seizes the chance to make amends for his heinous sin, yet who discovers, all too late, that, for some sins, there can be no redemption.  Peter Mullan provides a superbly understated interpretation of a man whose acquisition of immense wealth and power only mask the loneliness and guilt he feels inside.  Wes Bentley as the chief railroad surveyor, Nastassja Kinski as Dillon&#65533;s ailing wife, Sarah Polley as their daughter and Milla Jovovich as Dillon&#65533;s devoted mistress all turn in outstanding performances.  Although none of these characters are afforded the same richness and depth that Dillon is, they still create a fascinating tapestry of conflicting dreams and emotions.  For the concept of &#65533;dreams&#65533; is a core element of the story&#65533;s pioneer theme.  Here are a group of rugged individualists, all enduring great hardships on a wild outpost far away from the soothing amenities of civilized life &#65533; yet all dreaming of being a part of the building of a burgeoning new nation, of which the makeshift towns and railroad-building are truly indelible symbols.And, indeed, in many ways, it is the images &#65533; of rugged mountains, of the relentlessly falling snow, of a house being pulled by horses across a snowy plain &#65533; that stick with us most profoundly.  &#65533;The Claim&#65533; is a somber, moving and fascinating glimpse into our pioneer past.",4,impressive drama,997488000,"08 11, 2001",2001,2662,"['set', 'remote', 'Sierra', 'Nevada', 'mining', 'town', '1867', '65533', 'Claim', '65533', 'really', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', '65533', 's', 'classic', 'novel', '65533', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', '65533', 'transported', 'American', 'soil', 'move', 'good', 'one.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'wealthy', 'miner', 'named', 'Daniel', 'Dillon', 'who', 'practically', 'town', 'Kingdom', 'Come', 'own', 'personal', 'fiefdom', 'One', 'fateful', 'day', 'three', 'groups', 'people', 'arrive', 'town', 'railroad', 'surveyors', 'who', 'offer', 'possibility', 'train', 'may', 'soon', 'be', 'passing', 'town', 'bringing', 'people', 'wealth', 'prosperity', 'prostitutes', 'who', 'plan', 'open', 'up', 'shop', 'all-male', 'community', 'sickly', 'woman', 'beautiful', 'young', 'daughter', 'who', 'out', 'are', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Dillon', 'sold', 'bag', 'gold', 'desperate', 'youth', '65533', 'decision', 'lived', 'rue', 'ever', 'since.Given', 'multi-character', 'canvas', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'director', 'Michael', 'Winterbottom', 'take', 'almost', 'painterly', 'approach', 'allowing', 'drama', 'unfold', 'unhurried', 'pace', 'can', 'concentrate', 'bleak', 'snowy', 'winter', 'setting', 'up', 'playing', 'great', 'role', 'drama', 'characters', 'most', 'compelling', 'Dillon', 'figure', 'almost', 'tragic', 'proportions', 'man', 'who', 'chance', 'make', 'amends', 'heinous', 'sin', 'who', 'discovers', 'too', 'late', 'sins', 'can', 'be', 'redemption', 'Peter', 'Mullan', 'superbly', 'understated', 'interpretation', 'man', 'acquisition', 'immense', 'wealth', 'power', 'only', 'loneliness', 'guilt', 'inside', 'Wes', 'Bentley', 'chief', 'railroad', 'surveyor', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'Dillon', '65533', 's', 'ailing', 'wife', 'Sarah', 'Polley', 'daughter', 'Milla', 'Jovovich', 'Dillon', '65533', 's', 'devoted', 'mistress', 'turn', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'afforded', 'same', 'richness', 'depth', 'Dillon', 'still', 'create', 'fascinating', 'tapestry', 'conflicting', 'dreams', 'emotions', 'concept', '65533', 'dreams', '65533', 'core', 'element', 'story', '65533', 's', 'pioneer', 'theme', 'Here', 'are', 'group', 'rugged', 'individualists', 'enduring', 'great', 'hardships', 'wild', 'outpost', 'far', 'away', 'soothing', 'amenities', 'civilized', 'life', '65533', 'yet', 'dreaming', 'being', 'part', 'building', 'burgeoning', 'new', 'nation', 'makeshift', 'towns', 'railroad-building', 'are', 'truly', 'indelible', 'symbols.And', 'indeed', 'many', 'ways', 'images', '65533', 'rugged', 'mountains', 'relentlessly', 'falling', 'snow', 'house', 'being', 'pulled', 'horses', 'snowy', 'plain', '65533', 'stick', 'most', 'profoundly', '65533', 'Claim', '65533', 'somber', 'moving', 'fascinating', 'glimpse', 'pioneer', 'past']",N/A

Three people arrive in his town on the same stage on the same day. Two represent his past and one his future. One of them is Donald Dalglish the man from the railroad who will decide if the railroad comes through Kingdom Come making everyone rich, or passes it by killing it. The other two are a mother and daughter who bring with them a past that Dillon is forced to deal with.My Opinion:  The story seems like it should be a good one, but it's just not very engaging. The characters seem like they should be interesting and likeable, but the end up being flat and dull. The main character Mr. Dillon is never developed as a character to the point where we know or care why he did what he did and how he feels about it now. The plot ends up being straight forward, but is confused through partial flashbacks during the movie. The direction and acting are fine, but they end up being just window dressing on a story that I found no reason to care about.

Allow me to be your guide on this particular film, it is defenitely a must-see, though not for everyone. If you are expecting a thrill-seeking, shoot em up western then you are wasting your time, however, if you want to see great storytelling and perfect cinema... this one is for you.It is a rarity in modern cinema for direction to be the most important factor in a film. Most directors are essentially part problem solvers and part general, leading the troops through the maze of reshoots and press releases. That is not the case with ""The Claim."" Micheal Winterbottom does what very few directors are able to do, carry a film. Having said that, cinematographer Alwin H. Kuchler desrves his share of praise as well, transforming the landscape of mid-1800's California into as lush and beautiful a backdrop as the Arabian desert in ""Lawrence of Arabia"".But the acting is terrific as well, from the lovely Milla Jovavich, to Natasha Kinski, and the great young duo of Wes Bentley and Sarah Polley, the film was cast perfectly. But the breakout here is the brilliant performance of Peter Mullen as the main character Daniel Dillon. Peter makes the most of the rich character as he winds his way from greed, to shame, all the way back to redemption, his engrossing performance is secondary to only the aforementioned Winterbottom and Kuchler.This film isn't merely worth your time, but it made my pick as the best film of 2001 (though it was technically released in 2000 for an attempt at an Oscar run.)

579463,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B00005AX6G,Trevor Willsmer,"[1, 1]","It may be harsh to say that Michael Winterbottom is one of the most consistently bad directors working today, but his emphasis on often counterproductive technique at the expense of story or character has resulted in an almost unbroken run of poor films from promising material - which in many ways is far worse than making bad films out of videogames. Ever the alchemist, once again he manages to turn gold into base metal with The Claim, a fairly lavish version of Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge relocated to the California mountains during the Gold Rush. While the basic story transposes rather well - a down on his luck prospector who sold his wife and child for a gold claim and rose to rule the town that grew up around it finds himself on the road to destruction when they reappear and he attempts to make amends - it's little more than an underdeveloped skeletal outline that never grips, feeling less an attempt at subtlety, more underwritten.While it throws out the complexity of the source material, there's enough left here that could have made a good adult Western drama in other hands, especially in the neat turn around from genre tradition that sees Peter Mullan's all-powerful Mayor of Kingdom Come trying to persuade Wes Bentley's surveyor to drive the railroad through his town to ensure its growth. Yet it never gets to the heart of the story, playing the big scenes for less than they're worth (hard to believe any director could botch a scene of Mullan harnessing the whole town to manhaul his marital home across the snow and into the heart of town, but Winterbottom manages it) and constantly pushing characters and story into the background without ever placing anything in the foreground to compensate. Worse, no present-day action in the film has any real consequence, which is fairly disastrous for a morality play about consequences. It's the kind of film where people get killed and their death makes no impression on the emotions or actions of anyone around them leaving a dreary, inconsequential film with no drive.Rather than story or character, Winterbottom seems interested in recreating the world of McCabe and Mrs Miller, but he's taken all the worst of Altman without any of the best. There may be an occasional improvised feel, but it's rarely harnessed to the film's benefit, feeling like undisciplined self-indulgence and all too symptomatic of the way that far too much of the film is played out of focus, both metaphorically and literally. Indeed, it often feels like a film whose few strengths have little to do with the director. Peter Mullan is superb as the Mayor, convincingly essaying the kind of man who can rule an entire town by sheer force of will alone, but while you understand his emptiness, the film never allows you to feel for it, leaving the finale a rather empty spectacle rather than genuine tragedy. If anything, the film's tragedy is that Mullan didn't get a film worthy of his performance. Unfortunately the supporting performances are rather dull and characterless: Nastassja Kinski has little to do but waste away, Sarah Polley isn't able to do much with her cardboard good girl, Milla Jovovich lacks the moxie her saloon manger cries out for while Wes Bentley tries to coast on charisma without ever having enough to do the trick. Instead they're outshone by production designer Mark Tildesley's superbly recreated snowy mountain town and a surprisingly powerful and heartfelt Michael Nyman score that abandons his usual mathematical masturbation for something more grandiose and passionate.

579464,ANN4JW1E08AS6,B00005AX6G,tuberacer,"[4, 4]","This is superior film making. The acting is excellent, the setting is meticulously authentic, the story is profound on a Biblical level. Michael Nyman's music is poignant. There is one scene when Milla Jovovich sings a song which alone makes the film worth watching. This is not Clint Eastwood, thank God. It doesn't have a gun fight for twenty minutes through the town with men getting shot and falling into the horses' water troughs. It is not burdened with the overbearing presence of a major star. It wouldn't have worked if there had been someone like that prancing around. If you want that kind of Hollywood Western which even Clint can't get away from still making, then look elsewhere. Go watch ""The Unforgiven"" again for that stuff. The two movies are very similar in setting, but wow what a difference. Comparing this to Hardy's work too is ridiculous. Why does anyone do that? What in the world does that achieve? This is a movie wholly of itself. Once it starts its ball rolling it has nothing to do with Hardy. American author Frank Norris might be a more fruitful comparison, if anyone, but this movie is a 21st Century production, not a work made before the turn of the 20th Century. Seem to be a lot of people who come to this movie with some kind of prejudice that they then rate it by. Just sit back and watch it and digest it without the large Coke and pre-buttered popcorn. Some may not have the patience for this film. I feel sorry for them. They're missing quality at work which doesn't have an eye on the box office receipts--one of the rare films. This is a movie for the attentive viewer who can read the depth of the story being told--a strong story with personal and historical significance. Think ""Oedipus"" maybe. This is probably the ""truest"" ""Western"" I've ever seen.
