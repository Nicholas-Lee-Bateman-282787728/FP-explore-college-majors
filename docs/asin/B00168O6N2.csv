1152666,A47OISX4AV8I,B00168O6N2,AngelosOne,"[0, 0]","I loved the original film.  It was what you would expect from a light-hearted adventure film about a history-loving treasure hunter; one who's crazy enough to do anything to protect it.The second film is in some ways, even better than the first.  True, the aspect of history became a bit more generalized and less focused, but the character interactions and arcs were stronger this time around.  I highly recommend watching the second film, if you liked the first, as you won't be dissapointed.  A fun film is a fun film, after all.Now, on to the blu-ray versions.  First, this package deal is great.  Buying them stand alone would cost you more than buying them in this package, so it's a bit silly for you to buy them any other way (that is, unless you already have the first one in BD).  Both film transfers are great.  Clean, sharp, and pristine.  Nothing to complain about, as Disney keep doing a great job in the HD transfer department.It's a good buy, if you want a fun filled weekend.  A back-to-back marathon of National Treasure, with some snacks and a group of friends sounds hella fun to me.",5,Action and a little history - but don't forget to throw in a little daring doo...,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",2008,1103,"['loved', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'light-hearted', 'adventure', 'film', 'history-loving', 'treasure', 'hunter', 'one', 'who', 'crazy', 'enough', 'do', 'anything', 'protect', 'it.The', 'second', 'film', 'ways', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'True', 'aspect', 'history', 'became', 'bit', 'more', 'generalized', 'less', 'focused', 'character', 'interactions', 'arcs', 'were', 'stronger', 'time', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'second', 'film', 'liked', 'first', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'dissapointed', 'fun', 'film', 'fun', 'film', 'all.Now', 'blu-ray', 'versions', 'First', 'package', 'deal', 'great', 'Buying', 'stand', 'alone', 'would', 'cost', 'more', 'buying', 'package', 'bit', 'silly', 'buy', 'other', 'way', 'already', 'have', 'first', 'one', 'BD', 'film', 'transfers', 'are', 'great', 'Clean', 'sharp', 'pristine', 'Nothing', 'complain', 'about', 'Disney', 'keep', 'doing', 'great', 'job', 'HD', 'transfer', 'department.It', 'good', 'buy', 'want', 'fun', 'filled', 'weekend', 'back-to-back', 'marathon', 'National', 'Treasure', 'snacks', 'group', 'friends', 'sounds', 'hella', 'fun']",National Treasure / National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets
