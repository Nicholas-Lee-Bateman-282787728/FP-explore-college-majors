1139573,ACMSW835UGT0J,B0012X6H3S,Marlowe7,"[11, 12]","Although the back of the case claims both films have been remastered in high definition, I doubt it.  In fact they seem to be the exact same single disc versions that were previously available.  ""My Stepmother is an Alien"" is still full frame here, which is suspect for a film that would have been remastered in 2009-2010.  Aside from that the picture quality is pristine.  ""Blind Date"" is presented in its original 2:35 aspect ratio, and though perfectly watchable by 480p standards, it's clearly at least a ten year-old transfer (again, same disc as before).  Considering you get two unique movies I'd say it's worth a buy if you're a fan of either one.

However, he gives a brilliant performance in this movie that is over-the-top and yet still believable.  I think this is by far his best performance ever.  Add to that very good performances by Bruce Willis and the very sexy Kim Basinger and others and you have an extremely good movie and perhaps the funniest I have ever seen.I like to watch this movie at least once a year and I never fail to enjoy it immensely.
