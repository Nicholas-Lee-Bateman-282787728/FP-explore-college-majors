Some critics will try to bash this film, but this is one of his best direct to video films ever.Like some other people have said, ""The Keeper"" has a ""Man On Fire"" kind of feel to it. Let's be honest, MOF is better, but Seagal is a true action star unlike Denzel.My advice to all Seagal fans (& action movie fans) is to check out ""The Keeper"". Seagal does his own lines (no dubbing!), and he does the majority of the hand-to-hand fight sequences.***Seagal Fight Scenes in ""The Keeper""***1) 2 bad guys are harassing the cousin of Rolland's limo driver. Seagal beats up the 2 guys & they go away.2) At the club. A guy tries to hit on Nikita and Rolland kicks his @$$, bends his arm, & repeatedly slams his face on the counter.3) Gunfight & knife work - When Nikita gets kidnapped & Seagal tries to stop it, but can't (cool car chase scene).4) Rolland aka Seagal goes after Mason (boxer). Rolland snaps the watchman's neck and he shoots up Mason's two big bodyguards. Mason b!tches up.5) Shoot-out in the parking-lot/ fight in the restaurant. Rolland vs. Cross' henchman (hand-to-hand combat). Seagal wins.6) Final showdown @ villain Cross' Ranch - Seagal in stealth mode/ Rambo mode with knife. Rolland uses the high caliber sniper rifle & kills Cross' henchmen, then he rescues Nikita. He shoots 2 goons & then fights Cross' right hand man. The Final Fight is hand-to-hand combat. Seagal slams him through the glass table, then Seagal gives him ""The Five Fingers of Death"".

1267354,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002G1WPIG,Mark Turner,"[28, 32]","The career of Steven Seagal has jumped from high to low to mediocre. When he began his action film set the bar for fight sequences just as it had been set by Bruce Lee years prior. But as he aged and became more popular, his films began to take on a different tone, preaching instead of fighting, made by less skilled directors more focused on his acting ability than his martial arts skills. And it was those skills that drew fans to the seats, not the acting.This is not to say that Seagal's acting skills aren't up there. While made fun of by impersonators and joked about by night time talk show hosts, he's actually not bad. Unfortunately a number of his movies were. But that involved more plot lines, scripts and directors who didn't quite no how to use him. Such is not the case with THE KEEPER.Seagal returns to form as tough as nails cop Rolland Salinger whose dirty partner shoots him during the film's opening sequence. Rolland survives and even gets revenge when the cop tries to kill him in the hospital. But even though wronged, the force demands he take an early retirement (a nice plot line that plays to Seagal's age rather than ignore it).At home recovering, Rolland continues to nurse himself back to speed while relying on pain killers to help him out. Not overly so but to Rolland this is a sign of weakness and as the film progresses, he depends on them less and less.While deciding what to do about the forced retirement, Rolland gets a call from old friend Conner Wells (Steph Duvall), an ex Texas policeman who struck it rich. It seems that someone has tried to kidnap Conner's daughter Nikita (Liezl Carstens) and taken out her bodyguard in the process. Knowing Rolland's skills at personal and property protection, Conner hires him to be the new head of security and Nikita's personal bodyguard.Not only does Rolland improve security, in watching Nikita he has the chance to find out just who is behind the kidnapping scheme. One person involved is Nikita's boyfriend, an up and coming boxer backed by Conner. A self interested player, he's tied into a criminal named Jason Cross who has a past with Conner.Various fight sequences that demonstrate what Seagal brought to the genre years ago result in broken bones and hurt feelings when Nikita feels over protected. At the same time she develops a respect for Rolland as well.With all the attempts to kidnap Nikita, we know eventually one will work. It is then that Rolland gets the entire story from Conner. Cross is trying to steal Conner's land from him, land that has more value to it than mere oil. Now he must sign over that land to Cross and in return Nikita will be released.Too bad Rolland doesn't like to play games by other people's rules. With a little help from some friends, Rolland sets out to track down Nikita and Cross and to make sure that this story winds up in his favor. Trust me, it's not a spoiler to tell you who comes out on top in the end. I mean come on; this IS a Steven Seagal movie. Then again he didn't finish well in EXECUTIVE DECISION.With enough fight sequences to demonstrate Seagal's technique, plenty of guns and explosions and several good looking women to satisfy the male chauvinist pigs, this movie brings Seagal back to the fold of solid action stars.

1267355,A2HSFKLLQHYY6S,B002G1WPIG,Matt Skidmore,"[1, 4]","Our direct to video Lord, Steven Seagal returns once more to our cosy small screens with yet another slice of low budget action mayhem shot in some far eastern country where making films is cheap and script writing is an after thought. In his latest installment, Seagal plays ex-LA cop Roland Salinger (you know the kind, he's always referred to as 'the best in his class'), who after a near fatal shooting from his crooked partner switches careers and moves to work as a bodyguard for the daughter of his old friend Connor Wells.Connor's daughter Nikkita (a good Liezl Carstens - but that maybe my libido talking, I'm not sure) is the usual rich kid socialite kind who is dating up and coming boxer Mason Silver (played by Arron Shiver) and at first treats Seagal with the usual cinematic contempt that these movies always display and doesn't want her life handled by the pony tailed avenger, but after a few star struck looks between them, she soon begins to warm to Seagal's porky charms. Unknown to our pony tailed hero however, Connor is caught up in some bad business with a bunch of very bad men (yes, its that level of writing) and when Nikita's not so loveable boyfriend organises a kidnap attempt on Nikita's life - Seagal goes all Denzel Washington and unleashes his inner 'Man on Fire' on all and sundry culminating in a final kick off gun battle at Connor's home!To be fair to Seagal, this time out - efforts do seem to have been made. He looks better than he has been in recent movies and he seems to be making a point to be more active in the 'thespian' department. He actually seems to be taking part in the film this time around, and not just a badly dubbed, awfully body doubled shadow of his former self. The direction by Keoni Waxman is solid, if uninspired - but, its a major step up from what we have been seeing from his other recent collaborations. The script is pedestrian at best and is basically a semi-remake of 'Man on Fire' anyway, but from a reflective point of view - you can't really knock the movie as in terms of a direct to video vehicle for Seagal, it is watchable, it has decent production values and it rarely drags. The only criticism I would have for it is that it almost tries too hard to be a proper movie and with that caveat it loses any sense of fun that we have seen from other recent Seagal epics such as 'Kill Switch' (you know the one with ''that blonde woman ending'') and his other, more stranger efforts. However, he does wear a stetson for a period of time, which made me smirk for a few minutes so I guess all was not lost on the comedy front...All in all, a decent if uninspired movie that confirms when he does make an effort, Seagal can deliver a minor watchable entry in his twilight years. Its not 'Under Siege' and to be fair, his newer movies will never be, but in terms of his other recent output, it is certainly a step in the right direction. The disc is a movie only affair with a decent transfer - minor grain, but I am sure that is more to do with the look of the film rather than the presentation.

1267357,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B002G1WPIG,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 1]","""The Keeper"" comes off the heels of the debut of Steven Seagal'sLawmanTV show and the better-than-averageDriven to Kill. With the exception of a few small blunders, Seagal's career has been on a roll, but while his 32nd self-starring action feature continues the trend of storyline coherency and good production values, it's the least remarkable of his recent flurry of decent outings. It's an okay movie, but Seagal doesn't have time for merely ""okay"" at this point in his career. I was hoping for a few more touches of ingenuity that I had come to expect from the Buddhist Bonecrusher's recent activity, but overall, this one is a step back in quality.The story: following a near-fatal double-cross by his partner, detective Roland Salinger retires from the police force. Following rehabilitation therapy, he's contacted by an old friend and Texas socialite (Steph Duvall,Open Fire) with an offer to protect him and his daughter (Liezl Carstens, promoted from her grieving widow role inUrban Justice) from the dastardly efforts of a local crime boss (Luce Rains,Appaloosa) to steal their wealth.Promotional material for this film likened it toThe ProfessionalandMan on Fire; in my opinion, this borders on the sacrilegious, but ""The Keeper"" does manage to express a fairly nice relationship between a girl and her bodyguard. Sure, it's an awfully forced one and you can't have a movie where a woman thirty years his junior isn't smitten with Seagal, but Liezl Carstens gives a passable performance and inspires some extra effort in Steven, which is always nice for a change. Surprisingly, the film is full of mildly-interesting little snippets to temporarily relieve the monotony: it makes allusions to Seagal's real-life police work and his genuine fondness for pistols, features him speaking fluent Spanish at length, and contains a couple great scenes of him dispensing righteous Seagalian justice on women-beaters. Though the film opens with a body double and some obvious dubbing, the film steers clear of that for most of its remainder. The acting isn't great, but the aforementioned cast - including Arron Shiver (Save Me) as Carsten's turncoat boyfriend - is solid and consistent.As for the action? Well, there's a pretty fine car chase and a decent woodland shootout to look forward to, but that covers all of the good stuff. Steven's obviously doing his own martial arts again and there's a thoroughly awesome instance in which he stabs a goon through the throat with his bare fingers (!), but with the possible exception of a single encounter, the fight scenes all suffer from the same shoddy camera angles and restricting cinematography that you'll find in the worst of his movies. The film defines itself as a DTV production via some weird, time-killing collage shots and other nonsense involving post-production editing. With the exception of Seagal getting shot in the beginning, the story sports absolutely no unexpected twists or otherwise intrigue; it's hinted that his character's addiction to painkillers may be a point of interest, but this is dropped before anything significant happens. In other words, the only reason you have to watch this movie is if you like watching Steven Seagal, even if all he's doing most of the time is walking around in sunglasses.After having upped his game via the efforts of directors Roel Reine and Don Fauntleroy, Steven's work with Keoni Waxman (Shooting Gallery) is enough to make you forget that his recent revival ever happened. Please, buy this one over the likes ofKill Switch, but say a prayer with me that Seagal's upcoming Waxman collaboration won't inspire a lower rating than this one.",3,"""Your luck can only take you so far...""",1264464000,"01 26, 2010",2010,3654,"['Keeper', 'heels', 'debut', 'Steven', ""Seagal'sLawmanTV"", 'show', 'better-than-averageDriven', 'Kill', 'exception', 'few', 'small', 'blunders', 'Seagal', 'career', 'been', 'roll', '32nd', 'self-starring', 'action', 'feature', 'trend', 'storyline', 'coherency', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'least', 'remarkable', 'recent', 'flurry', 'decent', 'outings', 'okay', 'movie', 'Seagal', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'merely', 'okay', 'point', 'career', 'was', 'hoping', 'few', 'more', 'touches', 'ingenuity', 'had', 'come', 'expect', 'Buddhist', 'Bonecrusher', 'recent', 'activity', 'overall', 'one', 'step', 'back', 'quality.The', 'story', 'following', 'near-fatal', 'double-cross', 'partner', 'detective', 'Roland', 'Salinger', 'police', 'force', 'Following', 'rehabilitation', 'therapy', 'contacted', 'old', 'friend', 'Texas', 'socialite', 'Steph', 'Duvall', 'Open', 'Fire', 'offer', 'protect', 'daughter', 'Liezl', 'Carstens', 'promoted', 'grieving', 'widow', 'role', 'inUrban', 'Justice', 'dastardly', 'efforts', 'local', 'crime', 'boss', 'Luce', 'Rains', 'Appaloosa', 'steal', 'wealth.Promotional', 'material', 'film', 'likened', 'toThe', 'ProfessionalandMan', 'Fire', 'opinion', 'borders', 'sacrilegious', 'Keeper', 'manage', 'express', 'fairly', 'nice', 'relationship', 'girl', 'bodyguard', 'Sure', 'awfully', 'forced', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'movie', 'where', 'woman', 'thirty', 'years', 'junior', ""n't"", 'smitten', 'Seagal', 'Liezl', 'Carstens', 'passable', 'performance', 'extra', 'effort', 'Steven', 'always', 'nice', 'change', 'Surprisingly', 'film', 'full', 'mildly-interesting', 'little', 'snippets', 'temporarily', 'relieve', 'monotony', 'allusions', 'Seagal', 'real-life', 'police', 'work', 'genuine', 'fondness', 'pistols', 'speaking', 'fluent', 'Spanish', 'length', 'couple', 'great', 'scenes', 'dispensing', 'righteous', 'Seagalian', 'justice', 'women-beaters', 'film', 'body', 'double', 'obvious', 'dubbing', 'film', 'steers', 'clear', 'most', 'remainder', 'acting', ""n't"", 'great', 'aforementioned', 'cast', 'including', 'Arron', 'Shiver', 'Save', 'Me', 'Carsten', 'turncoat', 'boyfriend', 'solid', 'consistent.As', 'action', 'Well', 'pretty', 'fine', 'car', 'chase', 'decent', 'woodland', 'shootout', 'look', 'forward', 'good', 'stuff', 'Steven', 'obviously', 'doing', 'own', 'martial', 'arts', 'again', 'thoroughly', 'awesome', 'instance', 'goon', 'throat', 'bare', 'fingers', 'possible', 'exception', 'single', 'encounter', 'fight', 'suffer', 'same', 'shoddy', 'camera', 'angles', 'restricting', 'cinematography', ""'ll"", 'find', 'worst', 'movies', 'film', 'DTV', 'production', 'weird', 'time-killing', 'collage', 'shots', 'other', 'nonsense', 'involving', 'post-production', 'editing', 'exception', 'Seagal', 'getting', 'shot', 'beginning', 'story', 'sports', 'absolutely', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'otherwise', 'intrigue', 'hinted', 'character', 'addiction', 'painkillers', 'may', 'be', 'point', 'interest', 'dropped', 'anything', 'significant', 'other', 'words', 'only', 'reason', 'have', 'watch', 'movie', 'like', 'watching', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'even', 'doing', 'most', 'time', 'walking', 'around', 'sunglasses.After', 'having', 'upped', 'game', 'efforts', 'directors', 'Roel', 'Reine', 'Don', 'Fauntleroy', 'Steven', 'work', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'Shooting', 'Gallery', 'enough', 'make', 'forget', 'recent', 'revival', 'ever', 'happened', 'Please', 'buy', 'one', 'likes', 'ofKill', 'Switch', 'say', 'prayer', 'Seagal', 'upcoming', 'Waxman', 'collaboration', 'wo', ""n't"", 'inspire', 'lower', 'rating', 'one']",N/A

1267362,A5NW620UKE9K,B002G1WPIG,phoongdan,"[2, 5]","Okay, so the good news is this direct to video feature is pretty well made. It does appear as though Seagal has made more of an effort to star in better quality direct to video features recently than in past years. The camera work is good, no obvious stunt doubles, and no voice dubbing in this one. Now the next step in his evolution of B-movie glory is to move away from this very, VERY tired role of playing a cop, or ex-cop, or retired cop, or wanna be cop, that has to rescue his daughter or someone else daughter. The role is virtually indistinguishable from Driven to Kill (2009) or Pistol Whipped (2008) and real similar to Shadow Man (2006). The settings change, Texas in this film, but the plots are nearly interchangeable! So while the camera work and acting have improved in his films in recent years, little effort has seemingly been put into a good story, or at least something somewhat original. Against the Dark (2009) was a poorly made movie, but at least there was some effort here to develop a different kind of story with a different kind of character. That's what Seagal needs to focus on now. Yes, there is always a place for this kind of B-movie action film, but I'd like to see some more variety in his roles.This film is set in Texas, so you get to see Seagal drive a big 'ol SUV, receive a cowboy hat as a gift (but never wear it), and talk like a hick at times in the movie, while at other times speaking Spanish, and talking in his normal voice at other parts of the film. What is it with Seagal and his different accents! What is his ""real voice?"" When he's around ""country folk"" he talks country, when he's around ""brothers"" he talks like he's black, when around Mexicans he's speaking some basic Spanish, when he's around Asians he's a reincarnated Buddhist God. LOL. Perhaps he's just trying to appeal to a wide fan base, but it does give the impression that he's a bit of a phony.The movie is okay, but the unoriginal storyline makes this one a weak effort in my opinion.Final Grade: C",2,Seagal YET AGAIN plays a cop role...,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",2010,2018,"['Okay', 'good', 'news', 'direct', 'video', 'feature', 'pretty', 'well', 'made', 'appear', 'though', 'Seagal', 'made', 'more', 'effort', 'star', 'better', 'quality', 'direct', 'video', 'features', 'recently', 'past', 'years', 'camera', 'work', 'good', 'obvious', 'stunt', 'doubles', 'voice', 'dubbing', 'one', 'Now', 'next', 'step', 'evolution', 'B-movie', 'glory', 'move', 'away', 'very', 'VERY', 'tired', 'role', 'playing', 'cop', 'ex-cop', 'retired', 'cop', 'wan', 'na', 'be', 'cop', 'rescue', 'daughter', 'someone', 'else', 'daughter', 'role', 'virtually', 'indistinguishable', 'Driven', 'Kill', '2009', 'Pistol', 'Whipped', '2008', 'real', 'similar', 'Shadow', 'Man', '2006', 'settings', 'change', 'Texas', 'film', 'plots', 'are', 'nearly', 'interchangeable', 'So', 'camera', 'work', 'acting', 'have', 'improved', 'films', 'recent', 'years', 'little', 'effort', 'seemingly', 'been', 'put', 'good', 'story', 'least', 'something', 'somewhat', 'original', 'Dark', '2009', 'was', 'poorly', 'made', 'movie', 'least', 'was', 'effort', 'here', 'develop', 'different', 'kind', 'story', 'different', 'kind', 'character', 'what', 'Seagal', 'focus', 'now', 'Yes', 'always', 'place', 'kind', 'B-movie', 'action', 'film', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'more', 'variety', 'roles.This', 'film', 'set', 'Texas', 'get', 'see', 'Seagal', 'drive', 'big', ""'ol"", 'SUV', 'receive', 'cowboy', 'hat', 'gift', 'never', 'wear', 'talk', 'hick', 'times', 'movie', 'other', 'times', 'speaking', 'Spanish', 'talking', 'normal', 'voice', 'other', 'parts', 'film', 'What', 'Seagal', 'different', 'accents', 'What', 'real', 'voice', 'When', 'country', 'folk', 'country', 'when', 'brothers', 'black', 'when', 'around', 'Mexicans', 'speaking', 'basic', 'Spanish', 'when', 'around', 'Asians', 'reincarnated', 'Buddhist', 'God', 'LOL', 'Perhaps', 'just', 'trying', 'appeal', 'wide', 'fan', 'base', 'give', 'impression', 'bit', 'phony.The', 'movie', 'okay', 'unoriginal', 'storyline', 'one', 'weak', 'effort', 'opinion.Final', 'Grade', 'C']",N/A

What better way to start the evening off then with a double feature opening with the transcendentDeath Ring? Absolutely nothing is exactly right. Naturally the only way to close it out would have to be with the legendary Steven ""Panda Bear"" Seagal. Now you may be wondering how we got our hands on The Keeper before it's release date. Well Sid and the old boy Seagal go way back and always get a pre-screen run before the masses get their hands on it's action packed goodness. Coming off some recent ""less then desirable"" features, The Keeper proved to be somewhat of a throwback to vintage Seagal. Sure he's still quite portly but smart as a whip and really picked up the a** kicking factor that he's famous for.This round we start with Seagal playing the usual rogue LA cop character named Rolland Sallinger. He along with his partner bust up a drug ring taking 2 of their members out with some sweet gun action. As Rolland gets ready to call it in his partner winds up shooting him since they couldn't come to terms on stealing the cool 2 mil sitting in front of them. Naturally Seagal plays by the books and winds up shot and retired because of it. He was a good man. Being newly retired doesn't keep him down for long when he gets a call from an old pal with a problem. He brings Seagal in as a high payed bodyguard to is daughter, which of course proves to be the best move. The rest is filled with some very entertaining beat downs, great laughs, and an actual audible dialogue from the 99% of the time whispering Seagal.The Keeper had a bit of a ""Man on Fire"" feel just way more b and with much much less emotion. This was a happy day for Sid seeing a glimmer in the chances of Seagal's career getting back on track. Ok, lets not get nuts here. No it won't get him back in the mainstream but should impress his group of followers out there. He's not and will probably never return to his former notoriety except among the action b loving community who will continue to watch his monthly features.

Forced into medical retirement he takes a job guarding the beautiful daughter of a wealthy business man and former police buddy.Bad guys want to kidnap said daughter. They succeed and Seagal goes ""walking tall"" to go get her back. No plot twists. Nothing unexpected. Just a plain action flick of one ""superhero"" ex-cop beating up the bad guys.

1267371,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B002G1WPIG,trebe,"[0, 0]","Steven Seagal's direct to video action vehicle The Keeper (2009), isn't outstanding, but it is competently shot, and does manage to be entertaining, despite some flaws.  Seagal is in a familiar role, playing Roland Sallinger, a former cop who heads to Texas, to act as a bodyguard for the daughter of an old friend.The story involving a plot to kidnap and ransom the young woman (Leizi Carstens) who is involved with a professional fighter with dubious skills, doesn't carry much weight, but it provides adequate reason for Seagal to break some bones, race through the streets firing guns, whip out his knife, and kill with unexpected ferocity.  Coherent plots and believability are things that are seldom present in Seagal's DTV efforts.  While that is still mostly the case here, with dull villains and cardboard cops, there is at least a little more substance than usual, as there is no contrived romance, and Sallinger focuses mostly on the job.Seagal looks fairly good in his fight scenes, and it appears that he does most of them himself.  The energy and meanness he brings, particularly when wielding a knife, demonstrates that he is not just going through the motions.  The final battle is kind of an uneven affair, as Sallinger makes like a fatherly hero, before walking off into the night.The Keeper doesn't offer much that is new, and the story is weak in many areas, but the quick cut action scenes and violence, make for a decent watch, in what is a slight return to form for Mr. Seagal.  After this film, director Keoni Waxman (Maximum Conviction,A Dangerous Man) would collaborate again with Seagal, including the TV seriesTrue Justice.",3,seagal plays nursemaid in texas...,1367107200,"04 28, 2013",2013,1651,"['Steven', 'Seagal', 'direct', 'video', 'action', 'vehicle', 'Keeper', '2009', ""n't"", 'outstanding', 'competently', 'shot', 'manage', 'be', 'entertaining', 'flaws', 'Seagal', 'familiar', 'role', 'playing', 'Roland', 'Sallinger', 'former', 'cop', 'who', 'Texas', 'act', 'bodyguard', 'daughter', 'old', 'friend.The', 'story', 'involving', 'plot', 'kidnap', 'ransom', 'young', 'woman', 'Leizi', 'Carstens', 'who', 'involved', 'professional', 'fighter', 'dubious', 'skills', ""n't"", 'carry', 'much', 'weight', 'adequate', 'reason', 'Seagal', 'break', 'bones', 'race', 'streets', 'firing', 'guns', 'whip', 'out', 'knife', 'kill', 'unexpected', 'ferocity', 'Coherent', 'plots', 'believability', 'are', 'things', 'are', 'seldom', 'present', 'Seagal', 'DTV', 'efforts', 'still', 'mostly', 'case', 'here', 'dull', 'villains', 'cardboard', 'cops', 'least', 'little', 'more', 'substance', 'usual', 'contrived', 'romance', 'Sallinger', 'mostly', 'job.Seagal', 'looks', 'fairly', 'good', 'fight', 'scenes', 'most', 'energy', 'meanness', 'particularly', 'when', 'wielding', 'knife', 'not', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'final', 'battle', 'kind', 'uneven', 'affair', 'Sallinger', 'fatherly', 'hero', 'walking', 'off', 'night.The', 'Keeper', ""n't"", 'offer', 'much', 'new', 'story', 'weak', 'many', 'areas', 'quick', 'cut', 'action', 'scenes', 'violence', 'make', 'decent', 'watch', 'what', 'slight', 'return', 'form', 'Mr.', 'Seagal', 'film', 'director', 'Keoni', 'Waxman', 'Maximum', 'Conviction', 'A', 'Dangerous', 'Man', 'would', 'collaborate', 'again', 'Seagal', 'including', 'TV', 'seriesTrue', 'Justice']",N/A
1267372,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B002G1WPIG,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 3]","Steven Seagal's ""The Keeper"" is not a big-budget blockbuster action flick. You don't find big explosions or big car chase scenes (as for the latter, there is a small but decent one, though). ""The Keeper"" looks more like earlier Seagal films such as ""Hard to Kill"" and ""Marked for Death,"" but with less martial arts actions and shoot-outs. ""The Keeper"" doesn't pretend anything more than an old-fashioned grade B action.Steven Seagal plays a tough LA cop Roland Sallinger, who is forced to retire after receiving near death injuries during a drug raid. Then, Roland receives a call from his old friend Conner Wells (Steph DuVall), whose daughter Nikita (Leizl Carstens) was almost kidnapped. Roland flies to Texas and works as her bodyguard.The plot, which sounds like Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire,"" is rather generic, not particularly original. Some scenes drag on a bit too long, but the script itself is serviceable enough to make a reasonable action movie. Unfortunately there are not many action scenes, and though Seagal does some of the action himself, he is obviously helped by the tricky editing.Among the recent direct-to-DVD films starring Steven Seagal, ""The Keeper"" is average, or perhaps slightly above average.",3,(2.5 STARS) Average Direct-to-DVD Action Flick,1262908800,"01 8, 2010",2010,1221,"['Steven', 'Seagal', 'Keeper', 'not', 'big-budget', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'flick', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'big', 'explosions', 'big', 'car', 'chase', 'scenes', 'latter', 'small', 'decent', 'one', 'though', 'Keeper', 'more', 'earlier', 'Seagal', 'films', 'such', 'Hard', 'Kill', 'Marked', 'Death', 'less', 'martial', 'arts', 'actions', 'shoot-outs', 'Keeper', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'anything', 'more', 'old-fashioned', 'grade', 'B', 'action.Steven', 'Seagal', 'tough', 'LA', 'cop', 'Roland', 'Sallinger', 'who', 'forced', 'retire', 'receiving', 'death', 'injuries', 'drug', 'raid', 'Then', 'Roland', 'call', 'old', 'friend', 'Conner', 'Wells', 'Steph', 'DuVall', 'daughter', 'Nikita', 'Leizl', 'Carstens', 'was', 'almost', 'kidnapped', 'Roland', 'Texas', 'bodyguard.The', 'plot', 'Tony', 'Scott', 'Man', 'Fire', 'rather', 'generic', 'not', 'particularly', 'original', 'scenes', 'drag', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'script', 'serviceable', 'enough', 'make', 'reasonable', 'action', 'movie', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'Seagal', 'action', 'obviously', 'helped', 'tricky', 'recent', 'direct-to-DVD', 'films', 'starring', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'Keeper', 'average', 'perhaps', 'slightly', 'above', 'average']",N/A
