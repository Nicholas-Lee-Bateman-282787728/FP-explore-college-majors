I just missed season 3 when it was premiere. Now I'm gonna have to wait until it's on DVD again.Season 2 really open with a big bang. I thought I was watching Starwars there for a minute.

1038791,A1TZDTEULS0618,B000LC4ZI0,"Elianna Greenleaf ""PokeManiac""","[1, 1]","The second season of Stargate Atlantis has quite a few good episodes, but one can already glimpse the storyline weaknesses that will rear their ugly heads in season 3. The characters, too, are changing, and sometimes not for the better.Lt. Col. John Sheppard has become Jack O'Neill Jr. in this season. He cracks lame jokes, lets others do his work for him, and seems only to be good at flying planes. However, Dr. Elizabeth Weir isn't much different than before; she sometimes ends up making the wrong decision, but she's still fair. Dr. Rodney McKay begins to tread the road from crabbiness to sheer angriness; although brilliant, he seems driven to childishly ostracize everyone around him. Thus, he is very, very annoying, and due to this `conflicted' personality, the writers love giving him center stage. Teyla is still the warrior woman, however, and she offers up her wisdom now and again. Ronon is the newest member of the team; although not being very emotive, he's likeable. Dr. Carson Beckett, becoming a regular in this season, doesn't have much to do but is a very earnest character.On to the episodes:The Siege, Part III--7 of 10--This finished the 1st season cliffhanger somewhat well but also somewhat poorly. The spectacular ship Daedalus arrives to deal with the Wraith, but Lt. Aiden Ford is changed subtly by a Wraith, and the latter is a huge mistake. Ford was a nice, likeable, and cheerful character in season 1 and quite frankly, in this episode he becomes yet another annoying one. It puts a damper on the episode.The Intruder--9 of 10--While traveling from the Milky Way to Pegasus, the Daedalus encountered mysterious sabotage. This is one of the better episodes--a mystery at first, which quickly turns into a race against time, helped by nicely done computer effects. We see what the main characters did as they relaxed on Earth days before, and watch while some of them cope with both personal and life-threatening problems at the same time.Runner--7 of 10--The team meets Ronon for the first time, but has to contend with the errant Ford. The parts of the episode featuring dirty, disheveled Ronon are good; the worst part, though, is that Ford truly believes he's perfectly all right, but every member of the team insists on trying to get him to come back to Atlantis for medical treatment! Not even Teyla, wise leader of the Athosians, thinks to agree with him. Due to this, the episode feels slightly contrived. There is a very good fight scene between Ford and Ronon, however, that shows how equally the two are matched.Duet--8 of 10--Because of their fiddling with a Wraith dart, Rodney and one Lt. Cadman become locked within one body--Rodney's. This is good because of the large amount of comedy involved--it downplays Rodney's irritating qualities. Even with his character's dislikeable tendency, David Hewlett is a very good actor who makes the most of his role, fluctuating between two distinct and different personalities.Condemned--5 of 10--Convict day! The team falls into a bad situation as they find that a planet dumps its convicts on an island with the Stargate, so the Wraith can feed on them. The leader of the planet is the usual cowardly type, willing to sacrifice anything and everything so that he can live, whereas the convicts obviously have an insane and brilliant leader who can decipher any problems in the blink of an eye. All the guest characters are stereotypical in this way; it if weren't for such blatant unoriginality, this episode would be decent.Trinity--5 of 10--The team finds a potentially unending source of energy, but of course it doesn't work. Not Rodney at his best...in the whole episode he's more than insufferable. Aside from being grating, he's extremely cocky and smug, insisting on doing what he shouldn't. He's also scolded for his actions, but by the next episode is back to normal. Rodney ruins the story, unfortunately, as he does many times.Instinct--7 of 10--The team comes upon a man raising a Wraith girl as his daughter. This episode has several strong points as well as a few weak ones; it also marks the beginning of the--I'll be blunt--idiotic Wraith-turned-into-humans story arc. It is a good adventure, though. The man has a very good reason to raise a Wraith--he's not mad or foolish. The girl, too, is what could almost be called an oxymoron: a somewhat likeable Wraith!Conversion--7 of 10--Due to his adventures in `Instinct', Sheppard begins to change, and not for the better. Most of this episode chronicles Sheppard's metamorphosis--first subtle, then more and more noticeable until it becomes almost horrifying. The trying part of this episode is Dr. Weir, who doesn't exactly make the best decisions of her career. Her foolishness, as usual, is really vexing.Aurora--7 of 10--The team finds an Ancient warship dead in space, complete with its crew, who are in stasis but can conveniently interact; however, the Wraith are hovering nearby. As we in the audience can predict, none of the Ancient crew believe Sheppard when he pleads for them to search for a Wraith in their midst. If it weren't for the Ancients' stubbornness--they are supposed to be smarter than the average humans, right?--this episode would be over in twenty minutes, not forty-two.The Lost Boys--6 of 10--Ford returns, this time with a bunch of tough guys at his side, and coerces the team into helping him. Ford is, of course, hyperactive, delusional, and all-around aggravating; his plans are horrible, which adds significantly to the storyline. He presents more of a villainous front than that of a wayward ally.The Hive--7 of 10--Trapped aboard a Wraith hive ship due to Ford and his plans, the team tries desperately to escape. The Wraith worshippers--a very interesting but underutilized plot twist--are introduced in this episode, making it better than the previous one.Epiphany--6 of 10--Sheppard makes the mistake of running through a mysterious doorway and becomes trapped in a `bubble' inhabited by Ancients. There is the standard beautiful woman and dangerous challenge waiting for him; he grows a beard that, although months pass, never becomes more than stubble! This episode is interesting but clich&eacute;d.Critical Mass--10 of 10--There is a bomb in Atlantis, placed there by the Goa'uld-infiltrated Trust (which is based on Earth), and Rodney has to figure out how to disarm it. This is the best episode of the entire season--if not the entire show--featuring a shocking twist at the end that I could not see coming by a long shot!Grace under Pressure--5 of 10--Rodney is trapped in a sinking puddle jumper; by far, one of the most maddening episodes. The premise is sound, but Rodney spends his time ranting, raving, yelling, snapping, and being all-around horrific. To add to the chaos, Sam Carter pops up, making Rodney show the symptoms of his inane crush on her. If he's this bad here then I can only imagine how he'll be during season 4.The Tower--4 of 10--The team stumbles on a city exactly like Atlantis, ruled by nobles whose personalities resemble Henry the 8th and his court. This episode is more funny than anything else, given the fact that it's so terrible.The Long Goodbye--4 of 10--Sheppard and Weir become hosts to alien personalities and rampage around the city. Since the two personalities hold grudges against each other--anything else would have been boring--they are almost perfect fighters, escaping from their pursuers time and time again and making the episode very predictable. An interesting thing I noticed: Torri Higginson changes her acting style totally to fit the new character she's presented with, whereas Joe Flanigan acts...the same!Coup D'Etat--9 of 10--Ladon of the Genii, who we last saw in `The Storm/The Eye', returns to the city, telling Weir that he plans a coup of the Genii government. With surprises galore, this episode is just as good as any with the Genii, if not better. We see just a glimpse of the convoluted political situation within their government.Michael--5 of 10--The team begins their experiment with the Wraith-into-humans drug, which naturally results in disaster. Given the fact that the entire idea of making such a drug was imprudent, the episode logically becomes just as bad. The titular character is a classic villain--super-smart and exceptionally skillful, able to figure almost anything out in the blink of an eye.Inferno--6 of 10--A civilization, gifted with a shield that protects them from anything, runs the shield constantly until its source of power--a volcano--starts to erupt. The basis of this episode is a very interesting idea; however, both Sheppard and Rodney act like morons around one of the native women. As they almost grow close to fighting over her, one thinks of earlier episodes that would be a much better use of one's time.Allies--6 of 10--Michael returns, this time with a hive ship, calling for an alliance. Dr. Weir falls right into it and finds that the Wraith didn't particularly care for an alliance; in this episode, the denizens of Atlantis are tricked splendidly--only one of many times. Actually, it makes me wonder if the people of Atlantis are really Earth's best and brightest. If they get into trouble so easily, how in the world were they allowed to settle in the city?",4,Faltering slightly,1216684800,"07 22, 2008",2008,9272,"['second', 'season', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis',

(Never got Showtime)  Have all the seasons on DVD (1-9) and the first season of Atlantis.  First-off, I'd like to say any ""TRUE FAN"" of the Stargate series' would still be a fan, even through the changes.  Namely I'm referring to SG-1 and the start of season 9.  I miss Richard Anderson as Jack O'Neill as much as any other fan, but even though the changes aren't easy to get past, you can if you're a true fan.  (Ben Browder as the new add on is GREAT, not to mention Beau Bridges as the new commander!)Anyway, on to Atlantis.  The first season of Atlantis was superb!  The cliffhanger at the end was the best I've seen for any show.  (Dare I say, better than the first season cliffhanger for SG-1?)  That being said, the show is pretty good, but not perfect.  The big one being for season 2, they didn't really give Ford's character a good chance before replacing him with Ronon.  (Not that I dislike Ronon, but they already had an alien on their team)  The problem I have when people bad mouth and peck away at the show is how they point out the way that when they're in some impossible situation, at the last moment, they get out of it using some other equally as impossible plan!  Well duh!  That's one of the main devices for the Stargate shows!  If you don't like it, you shouldn't be watching the show!  I hate it when people say, ""Oh yeah, that would work!"" or something as equally stupid.  So, you find that detonating a nuclear warhead above Atlantis, then cloaking it using a combination of the city sheild and a cloaking unit from a jumper to make the Wraith believe the city was destroyed is a cop out, impossible and too convenient situation; but actually being in a distant galaxy, aliens everywhere, and the Stargate itself isn't???  Get my point?!There are few wrongs in the show, some believing it's one thing, but others not seeing it at all.  The only other thing that I think they should do with the show is pace themselves a little more, like they did in SG-1.  But I suppose since this is a spin-off and they have more knowledge of the universe already, they don't have to take it quite as slow.For the fans, it is about time they released the second season!  It should have been released in November, but supposedly they had some trouble getting all the special features together.

1038801,A1FEITLECMZ6EW,B000LC4ZI0,Jeffrey Thomas,"[3, 4]","Honestly, whilst there are episodes that aren't always the best in most series, and it can be expected to hear complaints, the Atlantis series is known as an even better series by a lot of people.This episode, while not my favorite, is a possibility put into an episode. I think they did a pretty good job. The whole idea of two people getting stuck in the same body through a Wraith transport device is probable, note that I am no scientist here, and is an intriguing idea which I see no problem with making an episode with.Whilst I know that SG-1 seasons 9 and 10 weren't great I know that, whilst not everything is connected the best between SG-1 and Atlantis, Atlantis is a great series with very well done stuff. I've seen the entire series of Stargate Atlantis and seasons 1-8 of SG-1 so I can make a pretty good assessment of both series. I have seen part of the first episode in season 9, which is when I stopped watching that series.I know there are parts where the people involved in making this series could do better. However, just looking at the Atlantis series, I know that it turned out really well. It may not span 10 seasons, however, it doesn't need to. A story can be written to span one book, ten books, three books, etcettera. The length of a series can be short or long. So, any comments going against the fact that this series was only 5 seasons are stupid. The series is summed up from beginning to end, that's how a story goes. They land on Earth in season 5, so from there it should end. With the war ended, at least for now, at that point there was no point of any more seasons.To end, SG-1 seasons 1-8 were great. However, they did start out needing improvement, which came as they went along. Stargate Atlantis, this series, is awesome. Whilst I wish the people who created this series and SG-1 could've done better in certain areas, they did well enough to be better than a lot of series out there.This series can honestly compete with a lot of other great series out there. Now, I'm not about to call this better than Star Trek, but, honestly, I don't even know if I can/want to judge which is better. I'm just going to leave it at this: this series is great, and anyone who would say differently may just have a bad taste in series.Just to add, this is also a comment on the one star post by Deprived. Yes, this is word-for-word. So, this review describes more than just Duet. This review is good, in my eyes, in the fact that it clears up some issues whilst commenting on the episode in a good way.I really do enjoy seeing the creativity of the Stargate series creators in action. Good stories like this are always enjoyable to hear, read, or see.Also, whilst I've seen all of the Stargate Atlantis series before I am going through it again. It's just that good.I hope that anyone who hasn't, or has, seen all of the Atlantis series before enjoys.Just a note though: something I noticed (I think this was in the first episode of the Atlantis series. If someone has evidence to the contrary, go ahead and list it as it would be good to clear this up.) in the first episode of this series was that I think the people posting the episodes cut out, or got the episodes from someone without a certain part(s), the conversation between Major Sheppard and the guy who got shot up with Wraith enzyme about what it felt like to go through the gate. I just wanted to point this out. However, I do know that this could be posted on the first episode and not here I'll just leave it as it goes along with my general points on the Stargate series.Thanks for reading.",5,Well Thought and Very Well Done,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",2012,3586,"['Honestly', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'always', 'best', 'most', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'hear', 'complaints', 'Atlantis', 'series', 'known', 'even', 'better', 'series', 'lot', 'people.This', 'episode', 'not', 'favorite', 'possibility', 'put', 'episode', 'think', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'whole', 'idea', 'two', 'people', 'getting', 'stuck', 'same', 'body', 'Wraith', 'transport', 'device', 'probable', 'note', 'am', 'scientist', 'here', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'see', 'problem', 'making', 'episode', 'with.Whilst', 'know', 'SG-1', 'seasons', '9', '10', 'were', ""n't"", 'great', 'know', 'whilst', 'not', 'everything', 'connected', 'best', 'SG-1', 'Atlantis', 'Atlantis', 'great', 'series', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'stuff', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'entire', 'series', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'seasons', '1-8', 'SG-1', 'can', 'make', 'pretty', 'good', 'assessment', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'part', 'first', 'episode', 'season', '9', 'when', 'stopped', 'watching', 'series.I', 'know', 'are', 'parts', 'where', 'people', 'involved', 'making', 'series', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'However', 'just', 'looking', 'Atlantis', 'series', 'know', 'turned', 'out', 'really', 'well', 'may', 'not', 'span', '10', 'seasons', 'however', ""n't"", 'need', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'written', 'span', 'one', 'book', 'ten', 'books', 'three', 'books', 'etcettera', 'length', 'series', 'can', 'be', 'short', 'long', 'So', 'comments', 'going', 'fact', 'series', 'was', 'only', '5', 'seasons', 'are', 'stupid', 'series', 'summed', 'up', 'beginning', 'end', 'how', 'story', 'land', 'Earth', 'season', '5', 'so', 'should', 'end', 'war', 'ended', 'least', 'now', 'point', 'was', 'point', 'more', 'seasons.To', 'end', 'SG-1', 'seasons', '1-8', 'were', 'great', 'However', 'did', 'start', 'out', 'needing', 'improvement', 'came', 'went', 'along', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'series', 'awesome', 'Whilst', 'wish', 'people', 'who', 'created', 'series', 'SG-1', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'better', 'certain', 'areas', 'did', 'well', 'enough', 'be', 'better', 'lot', 'series', 'there.This', 'series', 'can', 'honestly', 'compete', 'lot', 'other', 'great', 'series', 'there', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'call', 'better', 'Star', 'Trek', 'honestly', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'can/want', 'judge', 'better', ""'m"", 'just', 'going', 'leave', 'series', 'great', 'anyone', 'who', 'would', 'say', 'differently', 'may', 'just', 'have', 'bad', 'taste', 'series.Just', 'add', 'also', 'comment', 'one', 'star', 'post', 'Deprived', 'Yes', 'word-for-word', 'So', 'review', 'more', 'just', 'Duet', 'review', 'good', 'eyes', 'fact', 'up', 'issues', 'whilst', 'commenting', 'episode', 'good', 'way.I', 'really', 'do', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'creativity', 'Stargate', 'series', 'creators', 'action', 'Good', 'stories', 'are', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'hear', 'read', 'see.Also', 'whilst', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'series', 'am', 'going', 'again', 'just', 'good.I', 'hope', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Atlantis', 'series', 'enjoys.Just', 'note', 'something', 'noticed', 'think', 'was', 'first', 'episode', 'Atlantis', 'series', 'someone', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'go', 'ahead', 'list', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'clear', 'up', 'first', 'episode', 'series', 'was', 'think', 'people', 'posting', 'episodes', 'cut', 'out', 'got', 'episodes', 'someone', 'certain', 'part', 's', 'conversation', 'Major', 'Sheppard', 'guy', 'who', 'got', 'shot', 'up', 'Wraith', 'enzyme', 'what', 'felt', 'go', 'gate', 'just', 'wanted', 'point', 'out', 'However', 'do', 'know', 'could', 'be', 'posted', 'first', 'episode', 'not', 'here', ""'ll"", 'just', 'leave', 'along', 'general', 'points', 'Stargate', 'series.Thanks', 'reading']",Stargate Atlantis: Season 2

1038804,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000LC4ZI0,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[10, 12]","Stargate Atlantis continues to map out new territory without completely losing its connection to the series that spawned it.This seasons introduces some new characters to go along with the old ones. Most notable is Ronon Dexx who joins the team as the mostly silent, ""beat the opposition into submission"" type of personality. He plays a straight man and is good for some laughs.The Goa'uld make their presence felt even in the Pegasus galaxy hosting Atlantis. This could provide some interesting story lines in the future but is just getting started this season.While still darker in tone than the original, it is lighter than the first season. It is entertaining and fund to watch.Episode synopses appear below:The Siege Part III  - As last season closed, the cliffhanger had Atlantis under siege by the Wraiths and things were not going well. Atlantis was ready to self destruct and Maj. Shephard was on the way to a suicide mission. As is customary in such situations, the cavalry arrives just in the nick of time in the form of the Earth Ship Daedelus. It has some advanced Asgard technology on board which saves Shepherd and helps to destroy the hive ships attacking Atlantis. Some manage to get away and they are heading back with reinforcements. While the cleanup is going on, a lieutenant is rescued but he has been severely damaged by the wraith. He is irrational and jumpy about the others who do not fully trust him. As the enlarged wraith fleet arrives, Atlantis decides to gamble on deceiving them that a self destruct has really taken place. This occurs just as the damaged lieutenant steals a puddle jumper and flees through the gate.The Intruder - The Daedelus has made a trip back to Earth to let SGC know what's going on. Shepherd has been promoted to LTC and given command of the military contingent against the wishes of the commander of the Daedelus who wanted the job for himself. As the ship heads back for Atlantis, they become aware of a Wraith computer virus which has infected the ship. The virus is intelligent and self modifying. The is actively trying to sabotage the ship, kill off those who would try to fix the problem and summon the Wraith.Runner - A team from Atlantis is investigating a planet with extremely high solar radiation. While there, they find a dead Wraith. There is evidence that he was killed by Lt. Ford, the guy who fled in the first episode of the season. The team heads back to try and get him to come back.  They find a surprise. There is another human on the planet who has had a transmitter mounted in his back so that he can be the guest of honor in a sort of trophy hunt. He has managed to elude the Wraith for 7 years before being captured. He is set free by Lt. Ford who is deranged. Now it is a 3 way manhunt with nobody trusting anyone else.Duet - While investigating a world, a Wraith Dart comes through and scoops up Dr. Rodney (the megalomaniac) and a female officer assigned to security. The others manage to shoot it down before it can get away and let Atlantis's secret out. Now the team is stuck with trying to figure out get them both out of the dematerializer they do not understand. They have only enough power to get one person out and Rodney is the one they get, in the hope that he will be able to help get the other out. It doesn't work out like that though. He gets out but the consciousness of the woman gets stuck in his body along with his own. Now he has a voice stuck in his head that everyone finds uncomfortable. Its also a bit amusing since she takes control while he is asleep and uses the opportunity to arrange his and her own love life to suit. An second story involves Ronon Dexx who was rescued in the last episode. His people are all dead now and Shepherd is trying to get him integrated into the community with a few social hitches.Condemned - The Atlantis team is exploring a new planet and find something strange. At first, the locals seem like savages but, as they are being attacked, they are saved by another group of locals with advanced technology. It turns out that the area with the stargate, an island, is the local prison. The Atlantis population would like to arrange trade with the locals but they become aware of an ugly secret. The prison is successful because they prisoners are used by the Wraith for feeding. It is an easy source of food for the Wraith and keeps down the undesirables for the locals. The problem is that the Wraith have hearty appetites and even Jaywalking is a capital crime. When the exploring team is captured by convicts, everyone is working at cross purposes.Trinity - While exploring, an Atlantis team finds evidence of a huge battle in which lots of Wraiths were destroyed. Unfortunately, the weapon did not come in time to save the Ancients. Now,  the tech guys think they can finish the development work. If it works, Atlantis will have a power source that makes the ZPM crystals look like alkaline batteries. It's dangerous and there is a reason the Ancients abandoned it.Instinct - While investigating a new planet, the Atlantis team comes across a village that is intermittently plagued by a Wraith. The team agrees to hunt it down but finds something unexpected. They find a local ""scientist"" who has been raising a juvenile female Wraith as his daughter. He swears that it is not her who is terrorizing the village. He also maintains that there is another Wraith out there. The science types at Atlantis think they might be able to use the girl to develop a vaccine to fight the virus that causes humans to become Wraiths. It might even turn Wraiths back into humans.  The research is promising until the young Wraith girl jumps the gun causing no end of problems.Conversion - At the close of the previous episode, LTC Shepherd was injured by the Wraith girl who had tried the experimental virus. Some of their blood mingled. Now he is infected with the parasitic virus that produces Wraiths. Now the race is one to capture an alien bug, get some stem cells and find a cure. The col. is going stir crazy while this happens and is getting more and more volatile.Aurora - With the new power supply, Atlantis's sensors pickup indications of an Ancient ship on the other side of the galaxy. The Daedelus manages to find it and a Wraith ship at the same time. The Wraiths are driven off and the team decides to investigate the newly found technological treasure trove. When aboard, they find the complete crew in functioning stasis units and indications that their minds are active in a virtual environment. Sheppard decides to enter a pod in order to contact the crew. The problem is that the crew on the Ancient ship does not believe they are stuck in a simulation. They do not realize that 10,000 years has past. Sheppard admittedly has a fantastic story but he is having an even more difficult time than expected making himself believed. He is being sabotaged by the Wraith who have an interest in the ship.The Lost Boys - The team is following up on a tip and is captured. They are quickly taken to another planet where they find that they have been captured by a force led by the AWOL Lt. Ford. He has been on a rampage and has been taking Wraith ""enzyme"" from all of his victims. He feeds the enzyme to his followers to give them super strength. He thinks that is the way for humanity to defeat the Wraith. The enzyme prevents him from thinking straight. And, by the way, this one is a cliffhanger.The Hive - Lt. Ford's plan to prove the worth of the enzyme is simple. They use a stolen dart and use it to blow up a hive ship. That's what they were doing at the end of the last episode when they got captured. Remember, Ford doesn't think all that well under the influence of the enzyme. After the capture, all grow through withdrawal  from the enzyme. The longer it has been used, the worse the withdrawal. Help comes from an unexpected source from the least likely hero.Epiphany - While looking for an Ancient treasure trove, the team finds a cave protected by some sort of barrier. Camera images from the other side show nothing dangerous and they have no trouble pulling their probe back. People are another matter. When Shepherd touches it, he is sucked in and cannot withdraw. Things get stranger when McKay realizes that time is passing much faster on the other side of the barrier. Shepherd spends his time on the wrong side of the barrier meeting the ancestors of the Ancients. It is a sanctuary for people to prepare themselves for Ascension. It is also inhabited by a monster that only Shepherd is brave enough to face.Critical Mass - Stargate Command on Earth and Atlantis are plunged into chaos when it is revealed that a Goa'uld operative is hidden in Atlantis. The operative has orders to set a bomb to blow up Atlantis when the Stargate is used to dial Earth. They apparently want to destroy Atlantis to keep the Wraith from getting anywhere near them. The mole is very highly placed.Grace under Pressure - McKay is on a test flight of a refurbished puddle jumper when there is a problem and it crashes into the ocean. It quickly begins to sink and faces the prospect of being crushed by the pressure as it heads down. The clock is running as Atlantis tries to find him. Does anyone remember that McKay is claustrophobic?  There is a nice cameo by LTC Sam Carter from SG1.The Tower - The team is away visiting what seems to be a backward planet. It turns out, however, that the people they see are just the peons. The nobility live in a great tower which bears a striking resemblance to the central tower of Atlantis. In fact, it turns out to be a copy of Atlantis, complete with weapons systems. There is a strict separation between the nobility and the serfs and the latter are treated very badly. A dynastic succession controversy makes things that much worse.The Long Goodbye - This is a confusing one. The Atlantis Team finds two derelict ships, each with a life support system. When the first is rescued, an alien consciousness takes over Dr. Weir. She says that she and her husband were ambushed. Her imprint will only last a little while and she asks that LTC. Shepherd allow himself to be imprinted as well for a final goodbye. He agrees but things go south right away. They are a couple but they are trying to kill each other. They know their way around Atlantis and they are intent on killing each other no matter what.Coup D'Etat - The Genii are up to their old tricks. Through double dealing, they try to convince Atlantis that a coup is planned. It is all a plan to take Shepherd and some others as prisoners in exchange for some Atlantis technology. The plotters have their own plots, however, and there are coups under way. It is a convoluted plot that fits well with the Genii.Michael - Something is not quite right. The episode begins with a man in sick bay. As he is awoken, all of the command staff is notified to be there. He has amnesia and cannot remember anything. He is told that he was a member of a team captured by the Wraith and recaptured by Atlantis. That is not quite the truth which is quite a bit uglier. He was a Wraith upon whom an experimental retrovirus had been tried. The experiment threatens the existence of Atlantis itself.Inferno - Atlantic gets a message from a planet that is seeking help. They are having trouble with the shield left by the Ancients. It turns out that the local planet has a shield left by the Ancients and powered by a gigantic volcano. Since the locals have been running their shield on overtime, the power draw has awoken the volcano which threatens the entire planet. The evacuation just gets started when lava swallows the stargate. That means using the Daedelus to ferry people...a slow process. There is one ace in the hole. The planet has an Ancient battleship big enough to ferry everyone. Unfortunately it is not in working order. Dr. McKay is doing his best to figure it out and fix it but suspicions are slowing things down. Those suspicions are fueled by the observation that Atlantic would like to claim the ship.Allies - A Wraith hive ship arrives. Instead of opening fire, the Wraith ship opens communication. It is being led by Michael, the Wraith upon whom experiments were conducted. He is offering all sorts of Wraith military secrets...for a price. They want the retrovirus used to create Michael. They believe that will give them supremacy over other Wraith. They are a slimy group though and hidden agendas are not beyond the realm of possibility. The alliance is not what it seems. Earth is in trouble in this season ending cliffhanger.",4,Another Good Season,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",2007,12584,"['Stargate', 'Atlantis', 'map', 'out', 'new', 'territory', 'completely', 'losing',

But the good news is that Stargate Atlantis has become such a character driven show that even predictable story lines are entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.More of what I like:Not only do we get humor with our science fiction, even an entire episode intended to be a comedy (the very funny Duet).We get a lot of main character development, but we also have strong secondary characters (like Dr. Zelenka and Colonel Caldwell), that really give Atlantis a sense of community.Great special features, one of my favorites being ""Road to a Dream with Martin Gero"".  Ha ha!Commentaries with every episode!  I watch the episodes with my wife, who doesn't like Sci-Fi as a genre but is addicted to this show, and then I watch the commentaries on my little flat-panel while walking on the treadmill.  There's a lot of entertainment for the money here!Now, the one thing I really don't like about this set are the menus.  The purpose of the menu screens, I thought, was to help me navigate through the DVD, not to demo the special effects.  In my entire DVD watching career, these are the only DVDs where I've ever had to actually get up and move close to my TV just to read the episode selections!I did some measurements and the area devoted to the episode choices on the top menu screen is roughly 5% of the screen area.  The rest is special effect playbacks!  And, the menu selections themselves are listed using a thin, faded font that doesn't even stand out from the rest of the screen.  Blue on blue!  Brilliant!

However, seasons 1 and 3 also get five stars because of all five seasons, these are the only three that had close to half of the episodes being what I would call truly five-star and beyond.While I mention in other reviews that season 3 is the peak performance for Stargate Atlantis, I would also argue that it is merely an extension of the amazing episodes that were generated out of season 2. SGA was giving a great jumping point with season 1 and season 2 took those past episodes and expanded it to make something that truly became television worth watching every week.One of my favorite parts of the entire Stargate franchise is the character development and I thought some of the strongest was in this season. Season 3 saw great McKay-centric episodes, but season 2 saw many wonderful team-centric episodes that really helped to illustrate the bond created and forming between current and new characters on the show.I also thought some of the best storylines came out of season 2. Epiphany, Trinity, Duet, Inferno, Grace Under Pressure and The Long Good-bye are some of my all-time favorite episodes for storyline, character development and emotional response. All five seasons of Atlantis have been worth watching.

Even though I was not hooked to the original SG-1 (but loved the motion picture), Stargate Atlantis grew on me. The script is very well written, with lots of humor. This is intelligent writing at its best. There is chemistry between the cast, and the characters are lovable.Season 2 begins with the third and final part of Season One's ""The Siege"". If you recall, Season 1 ended with Sheppard flying into a Wraith hive with an atomic bomb in order to save Atlantis from the Wraiths. Should the Wraiths succeed in taking over Atlantis, they would have direct access to Earth! The Daedalus, a brand-new battle cruiser commanded by Col. Steven Caldwell, saves the day. The Daedalus is able to cruise in hyperspace, and can beam people up and down, just like Star Trek. The configuration of the ship is also the same, with the captain sitting in the middle of the cockpit. Honestly, I think the producers should not have introduced the Daedalus. It is too much of a Star Trek copy-cat. They could have instead created a brand new concept in a futuristic battleship. The battleship in Battlestar Galactica, for example, does not use the same technology as in the Enterprise in Star Trek.Ronon Dex (Jason Momoa) joins the cast of Atlantis in this season. I like his character, but doesn't he get cold being topless all of the time? You would also think he would be wearing a uniform.I don't like episodes such as when Sheppard turns into a bug and back again, or when Elizabeth gets another consciousness in her head and almost kills everyone. I think such episodes were rushed. Can you imagine a person in real life getting transformed into a bug and back again within a period of a few days? It could be possible, but it would be more believable if it took years for the metamorphosis to take place. Obviously, such long periods are not possible in one-hour long episodes. I would rather the producers air believable episodes, not just episodes with the sole intent of entertainment.My favorite characters are Dr. Rodney McKay (David Hewlett) and Dr. Carson Beckett (Paul McGillion). I would love to see Dr. Beckett take more principal roles.The season ends with the ""Allies,"" where the Wraith Michael brings a Wraith Queen to Atlantis to fight against another hive.

John Sheppard brings vitality, humor, and a modern day snarkiness to his role as military leader of Atlantis, and leaves this watcher eager for his next scene.
