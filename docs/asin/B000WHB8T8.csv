Johnson,"[4, 4]","9/11: Blueprint for Truth, the Architecture of Destruction (2008 Research Edition)From AE911 Truth, released in 2008, the film explores all aspects of the destruction of the Twin Towers, Building 7, in a non-partisan way. This is from a group of engineers & architects and an alternative points of view.The film takes a logical approach in viewing the inconsistencies of much of the data on the collapsing(s). It is not a ""Conspiracy Theory"" film as the film does not address who did what, which group or any such thing.The information is disputed and much has been resolved... or has it?It leaves it for you, the viewer to decide. Mr. Gage tells you right in the beginning that you should not just take the information as truth alone. It hopes that you will also read, investigate and draw your own conclusions or at least, start to question. Thermite discussed in detail. Lots of visual references (Charts) as well as video from many perspectives.Great film!",4,A Must See!,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",2010,960,"['9/11', 'Blueprint', 'Truth', 'Architecture', 'Destruction', '2008', 'Research', 'Edition', 'AE911', 'Truth', 'released', '2008', 'film', 'aspects', 'destruction', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'Building', '7', 'non-partisan', 'way', 'group', 'engineers', 'architects', 'alternative', 'points', 'view.The', 'film', 'logical', 'approach', 'viewing', 'inconsistencies', 'much', 'data', 'collapsing', 's', 'not', 'Conspiracy', 'Theory', 'film', 'film', 'not', 'address', 'who', 'did', 'what', 'group', 'such', 'thing.The', 'information', 'disputed', 'much', 'been', 'resolved', 'viewer', 'decide', 'Mr.', 'Gage', 'right', 'beginning', 'should', 'not', 'just', 'take', 'information', 'truth', 'alone', 'will', 'also', 'read', 'investigate', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'least', 'start', 'question', 'Thermite', 'discussed', 'detail', 'Lots', 'visual', 'references', 'Charts', 'as', 'well', 'video', 'many', 'perspectives.Great', 'film']",9/11: Blueprint for Truth - The Architecture of Destruction
1110010,A3SK6BFRXFQ9HA,B000WHB8T8,"Gary W. Crane ""Movie Lover""","[0, 0]",Another DVD showing 911 was a inside job.  A lot of information shown and explained making this DVD a great one to add to your DVD collection. You may wish some of the people talked longer but hey I didn't make it. But a lot of information is said and shown to show how the buildings were brought down. And some of the video concentrated on building #7 and what little damage was done to the actual building yet it came down. Oddly some first responders told the camera operators to get back saying the building was coming down WHILE it was still standing.,5,911 DVD review,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",2014,556,"['DVD', 'showing', '911', 'was', 'inside', 'job', 'lot', 'information', 'shown', 'explained', 'making', 'DVD', 'great', 'one', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'may', 'wish', 'people', 'talked', 'longer', 'hey', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'information', 'said', 'shown', 'show', 'how', 'buildings', 'were', 'brought', 'down', 'video', 'concentrated', 'building', '7', 'what', 'little', 'damage', 'was', 'done', 'actual', 'building', 'yet', 'came', 'down', 'Oddly', 'first', 'responders', 'told', 'camera', 'operators', 'get', 'back', 'saying', 'building', 'was', 'coming', 'down', 'was', 'still', 'standing']",9/11: Blueprint for Truth - The Architecture of Destruction
1110011,A1L7IMLGPF72GG,B000WHB8T8,Howard M. Kindel,"[2, 5]","Because of the almost exclusive emphasis on the science behind the fall of the Twin Towers,this should be the gold standard for 911 Truth Movement films; and perhaps with a good makeover it could be.  But as it is, it's too cumbersome and too cluttered.  Not cluttered with irrelevancies but simply with too much of the same point being made over and over again.  And it suffers from one of the most annoying - and least effective - rhetorical techniques: the ""As we'll see in a moment"" ploy, a ploy that almost never works well in a live presentation. Don't say what you're going to reveal later on; either reveal it there and then or restructure your material so that you don't have to preview what you're not yet ready to present.  Mr Gage, the speaker, seemed not to be in complete control of his material; plus, the visual material on the screen to his right seemed poorly conceived.  To be honest, the best parts of the film were those abstracted from other 911 films.  So, even though the points being made in the presentation were extremely significant, and the speaker had excellent credentials, all in all the film was far less effective than, for example, the David Ray Griffin film.",4,Too Much Clutter,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,1194,"['almost', 'exclusive', 'emphasis', 'science', 'fall', 'Twin', 'Towers', 'should', 'be', 'gold', 'standard', '911', 'Truth', 'Movement', 'films', 'perhaps', 'good', 'makeover', 'could', 'be', 'too', 'cumbersome', 'too', 'cluttered', 'Not', 'cluttered', 'irrelevancies', 'simply', 'too', 'much', 'same', 'point', 'being', 'made', 'over', 'again', 'one', 'most', 'annoying', 'least', 'effective', 'rhetorical', 'techniques', ""'ll"", 'see', 'moment', 'ploy', 'ploy', 'almost', 'never', 'well', 'live', 'presentation', 'Do', ""n't"", 'say', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'reveal', 'later', 'reveal', 'there', 'then', 'restructure', 'material', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'preview', 'what', ""'re"", 'not', 'yet', 'ready', 'present', 'Mr', 'Gage', 'speaker', 'seemed', 'not', 'be', 'complete', 'control', 'material', 'visual', 'material', 'screen', 'right', 'seemed', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'be', 'honest', 'best', 'parts', 'film', 'were', 'abstracted', 'other', '911', 'films', 'So', 'even', 'points', 'being', 'made', 'presentation', 'were', 'extremely', 'significant', 'speaker', 'had', 'excellent', 'credentials', 'film', 'was', 'far', 'less', 'effective', 'example', 'David', 'Ray', 'Griffin', 'film']",9/11: Blueprint for Truth - The Architecture of Destruction

El-Hewie""","[10, 37]","It does not cost much to prove the truth beyond doubt, with simple and inexpensive simulation of the site of the seven towers and the forces involved.  A high school kid could solve a quiz on the subject of inertia, impact, and leverage of the massive collisions on the two 107-stories WTC 1 and WTC 2 that caused the collapse of the 50-stories WTC 7.  The other four towers were too small to shake violently enough to collapse.  The simple truth was that the collisions of the two airplanes with the upper parts of WTC 1 and WTC 2 were witnessed by many people and recorded on videos.  As such, the impact from collisions at the upper portion of the towers must be factored into the simulation, for its absolute force of impact, its leverage on shearing the base of the buildings, and its thermal effect in initiating the cascading collapse.  Tower 7 was both high enough to capture greater vibration than every other tower and close enough to be totally engulfed in ashes, debris, and fire.The dishonest part of Richard Gage's presentation is his using long and convoluted statements from magazines, and other media sources, and his bragging about his architectural engagement without offering any engineering explanation of his demolition theory. Richard Gage was able to limit his presentation to his professional expertise and present the dynamics of collision, shock waves, melting of steel, and propagation of forces. Instead, Richard Gage delved into the politics of wars, democracy, threats to the constitution, and fear of future attacks.  An architect turning into a fear monger is a cheap sell.All the eleven people who reviewed this DVD before me lacked the history of long or credible reviewers and most have no traceable credentials to lend their opinions any authority.  Get the simulation right, show the forces of compression, momentum, shearing, and shock waves on the real site of the seven world trade buildings if you want people to believe in your hypothesis. The litmus test for an engineer is answering the basic questions on the amount of energy generated by impact and heat on such height.  If that is determined, could such energy suffice destabilizing the upper stories and how much of those two (location of impact and upper destabilization) would impact the base of WTC 1 and 2.  Next, would be the fraction of energy transmitted from the center of impact and collapse to WTC 7.  Those are basic engineering issues that Gage evaded despite his allegation of being a relevant architect.It is always easy to attack the government with its vast resources and quite easier to gather signatures from unwary and angry citizens, but a scientific and logical simulation would eliminate the stigma of radical obsession with fame and controversy for their own sake.",1,Nutty and dishonest,1270512000,"04 6, 2010",2010,2786,"['not', 'cost', 'much', 'prove', 'truth', 'doubt', 'simple', 'inexpensive', 'simulation', 'site', 'seven', 'towers', 'forces', 'involved', 'high', 'school', 'kid', 'could', 'solve', 'quiz', 'subject', 'inertia', 'impact', 'leverage', 'massive', 'collisions', 'two', '107-stories', 'WTC', '1', 'WTC', '2', 'caused', 'collapse', '50-stories', 'WTC', '7', 'other', 'four', 'towers', 'were', 'too', 'small', 'shake', 'violently', 'enough', 'collapse', 'simple', 'truth', 'was', 'collisions', 'two', 'airplanes', 'upper', 'parts', 'WTC', '1', 'WTC', '2', 'were', 'witnessed', 'many', 'people', 'recorded', 'videos', 'such', 'impact', 'collisions', 'upper', 'portion', 'towers', 'must', 'be', 'factored', 'simulation', 'absolute', 'force', 'impact', 'leverage', 'shearing', 'base', 'buildings', 'thermal', 'effect', 'initiating', 'cascading', 'collapse', 'Tower', '7', 'was', 'high', 'enough', 'capture', 'greater', 'vibration', 'other', 'tower', 'close', 'enough', 'be', 'totally', 'engulfed', 'ashes', 'debris', 'fire.The', 'dishonest', 'part', 'Richard', 'Gage', 'presentation', 'using', 'long', 'convoluted', 'statements', 'magazines', 'other', 'media', 'sources', 'bragging', 'architectural', 'engagement', 'offering', 'engineering', 'explanation', 'demolition', 'theory', 'Richard', 'Gage', 'was', 'able', 'limit', 'presentation', 'professional', 'expertise', 'present', 'dynamics', 'collision', 'shock', 'waves', 'melting', 'steel', 'propagation', 'forces', 'Instead', 'Richard', 'Gage', 'delved', 'politics', 'wars', 'democracy', 'threats', 'constitution', 'fear', 'future', 'attacks', 'architect', 'turning', 'fear', 'monger', 'cheap', 'sell.All', 'eleven', 'people', 'who', 'reviewed', 'DVD', 'lacked', 'history', 'long', 'credible', 'reviewers', 'most', 'have', 'traceable', 'credentials', 'lend', 'opinions', 'authority', 'Get', 'simulation', 'right', 'show', 'forces', 'compression', 'momentum', 'shearing', 'shock', 'waves', 'real', 'site', 'seven', 'world', 'trade', 'buildings', 'want', 'people', 'believe', 'hypothesis', 'litmus', 'test', 'engineer', 'answering', 'basic', 'questions', 'amount', 'energy', 'generated', 'impact', 'heat', 'such', 'height', 'determined', 'could', 'such', 'energy', 'suffice', 'destabilizing', 'upper', 'stories', 'how', 'much', 'two', 'location', 'impact', 'upper', 'destabilization', 'would', 'impact', 'base', 'WTC', '1', '2', 'Next', 'would', 'be', 'fraction', 'energy', 'transmitted', 'center', 'impact', 'collapse', 'WTC', '7', 'are', 'basic', 'engineering', 'issues', 'Gage', 'evaded', 'allegation', 'being', 'relevant', 'architect.It', 'always', 'easy', 'attack', 'government', 'vast', 'resources', 'quite', 'easier', 'gather', 'signatures', 'unwary', 'angry', 'citizens', 'scientific', 'logical', 'simulation', 'would', 'eliminate', 'stigma', 'radical', 'obsession', 'fame', 'controversy', 'own', 'sake']",9/11: Blueprint for Truth - The Architecture of Destruction
