Lets just say, Stargate- any season- is better than the stuff the SyFy channel puts out now. Claudia Black (Farscape) made her first appearance as Vala in &#34;Prometheus Unbound&#34;, Jolene Blalock (Star Trek Enterprise) as Ishta in a couple of episodes, Erica Durance (Smallville) in &#34;Affinity&#34;, guest stars I wouldn't expect in most of the junk that's on now.I remember a couple of &#34;special&#34; stories- &#34;Moebius, part 1 & 2 involving time travel to ancient Egypt to recover a power module left behind by the Ancients who built the Stargate system in the first place, not a bad story but a bit weak when it comes to the team using a camcorder to leave a message for the future( then the team in the altered timeline used the same camcorder to send another message to &#34;their&#34; altered future!). Richard Dead Anderson is a big &#34;Simpsons&#34; fan, I don't remember all of the details but &#34;Joe&#34; in &#34;Citizen Joe&#34; is actor Dan Castellaneta the voice of Homer Simpson- he did alright in this episode.",3,Better than anything &#34;SyFy&#34; does now,1356998400,"01 1, 2013",2013,1142,"['wo', ""n't"", 'write', 'book', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'season', 'well', 'anyway', 'just', 'say', 'Stargate-', 'season-', 'better', 'stuff', 'SyFy', 'channel', 'out', 'now', 'Claudia', 'Black', 'Farscape', 'made', 'first', 'appearance', 'Vala', '34', 'Prometheus', 'Unbound', '34', 'Jolene', 'Blalock', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Enterprise', 'Ishta', 'couple', 'episodes', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Smallville', '34', 'Affinity', '34', 'guest', 'stars', 'would', ""n't"", 'expect', 'most', 'junk', 'now.I', 'remember', 'couple', '34', 'special', '34', 'stories-', '34', 'Moebius', 'part', '1', '2', 'involving', 'time', 'travel', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'recover', 'power', 'module', 'left', 'behind', 'Ancients', 'who', 'built', 'Stargate', 'system', 'first', 'place', 'not', 'bad', 'story', 'bit', 'weak', 'when', 'team', 'using', 'camcorder', 'leave', 'message', 'future', 'then', 'team', 'altered', 'timeline', 'used', 'same', 'camcorder', 'send', 'message', '34', '34', 'altered', 'future', 'Richard', 'Dead', 'Anderson', 'big', '34', 'Simpsons', '34', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'details', '34', 'Joe', '34', '34', 'Citizen', 'Joe', '34', 'actor', 'Dan', 'Castellaneta', 'voice', 'Homer', 'Simpson-', 'did', 'alright', 'episode']",N/A

290945,ABSX5TGEGRH76,6302020190,"Andrew ""Radaar""","[216, 236]","As I said in my review for Season 7 of Stargate: SG-1, I cannot think of any other show in history that has had more false endings than this.  The writers were preparing for cancellation during both the sixth and seventh seasons, and the plans with those finales was to leave a cliffhanger to be resolved in an upcoming motion picture.  However, the Sci Fi channel kept renewing SG-1, making the movie idea irrelevant.  Finally, we get to Season 8.  Richard Dean Anderson, who plays central character Jack O'Neill (who gets promoted to General this year) stated that this would be his last season as a regular, a spin-off series, Stargate: Atlantis started up, and the plotlines of the show had already started to be resolved in the previous year.  So now the writers were absolutely convinced at the beginning of the year that Season 8 would be the final season.  They decided to make this year kind of like a big send-off for the series (very similarly to Buffy the Vampire Slayer's final season).  Strangely enough, SG-1 was picked up for a NINTH year, tying it with The X-Files for the longest running American sci-fi show.The year began with the great two-part episode ""New Order"".  With O'Neill still in stasis after the battle in Antarctica the previous year, Dr. Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson) is still in charge of the SGC.  Sam Carter (Amanda Tapping), who becomes a Colonel this year, and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) try to contact the Asgard about O'Neill's condition when they encounter an old nemesis they thought was vanquished: the Replicators.  Meanwhile, on Earth, Weir and Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) receive a very strange request from the Goa'uld system lords: they want to form an alliance with Earth.  Now that Anubis is (supposedly) gone, the System Lord Ba'al (Cliff Simon) has been absorbing Anubis' armies, weapons, ships, and technologies in an attempt to rule the Milky Way galaxy.  By the episode's end, Weir has left (on her way to Atlantis), O'Neill is now in charge of the SGC, and the now three-person SG-1 realizes that a big fight will be coming now that the Replicators have returned and the Goa'uld ""government"" is beginning to crumble.The next couple episodes are fair; one of them exists only to show O'Neill adjusting to his new rank, one shows Teal'c trying to adjust to life outside the SGC, while the others are standard fare that could have occurred during pretty much any other season.  Then we get the episode ""Covenant"", where a media mogul may have discovered evidence of alien life in our galaxy.  Since this was supposed to be the final season, the promos for the episode made it seem as if the Stargate program was going to be revealed to the public (sadly, things didn't go quite as the promos promised, but it was still a good episode, and was left open-ended, so they may do a follow-up in Season 9).In later episodes, we encounter a human-form Replicator that was constructed in the image of Col. Carter, a new character named Vala (Claudia Black) who caused some trouble for Jackson, and probably the greatest clip show EVER (I must say, the Stargate writers know how to use clip shows effectively).  ""Citizen Joe"" has Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer Simpson, and one of Richard Dean Anderson's heroes) playing Joe Sullivan, a barber in Indiana who, due to an Ancient device, sees flashes of Stargate missions.  Throughout the 8 years, he writes them down, forsaking his job and his family.  In the process of the episode, inside jokes and cracks at some of the shows less-than-stellar episodes are made (Stargate can make fun of itself like no other), my favorite being about the mysterious Furlings.  We know this race exists, but we've never encountered them.  When one of Joe's customers asks about them, he responds that he's sure they'll pop up soon.Everything leads up to the last five episodes, ""Reckoning, Parts 1 and 2"", the 90-minute ""Threads"", and the season finale (which was supposed to be the series finale), ""Moebius, Parts 1 and 2"", which bring the entire franchise full circle by, in a sense, going back to the Stargate movie that started it all.  Huge changes are made in these episodes, which are all great, and have a big impact on what can happen in Season 9 (although, as I've said, the writers weren't anticipating going on for another season).  Some of the best scenes in the entire series take place in these five episodes, and I must say that the way they ended ""Threads"" and ""Moebius, Part 2"" is just great.While this wasn't the best season of the show (I haven't decided if I should award S4 or S7 with that honor yet), it was definitely one of the best.  Even though some of its stand-alone episodes were just fair (a problem that plagued S5, which was the worst year, in my opinion), the episodes dealing with the larger story-lines were just fantastic.  Even though I am very happy with S9 so far, this would have made a perfect ending to a great series.  I am interested to see what will happen at the end of the series, see as how I believe that ""Moebius"" is the only way this show could ever end.",5,Beginning of the End,1122768000,"07 31,

290947,A3HP7JU4ZORF52,6302020190,Anja Rebekka Schultze,"[0, 0]","I am a huge fan of Stargate SG1, however I got a bit disappointed by season 8. Now do not get me wrong, the episodes in this season is still good, however I do not think the storytelling is as complex and rich as in the first seasons. It also bear to note that season eight is less new planet of the week and is more focusing on a small handful of continuous storylines, now this is not bad in itself, I think that is a pretty smart move by this point, however I think those storylines could be better. Like I said this is still a great season and it is definitely a must have for Stargate SG1 fans, but I think it is a step down from the rest of the series. Let me take a few examples, allot of the episodes in this season feel like exactly what we have seen before, a little new paint on an old story but still the same thing. We have an episode with a geeky, everyday man who learns of SGC's existence and his reaction, Daniel ascends at the brink of death again, and return to human form, and so on and so on, the show just felt cheaper, there where far less new societies, interesting aliens and so on, instead we got allot of old material just redone.Another problem with season eight is that this is the season where where Atlantis expedition is sent and you would believe that would get some mention, instead, mid season they start talking about the Pegasus galaxy without first mentioning that the expedition was sent and later they send a botch rescue mission, but here is a clue, perhaps instead of one more weak man with a drab life get entangled with the SGC through an alien device plot they could have used one episode to actually show that the Atlantis expedition is sent and do a story around that. One more thing I hate about this season is that they kill off two important secondary characters and hardly any time is dedicated to it, one of them even die off screen, the characters where just discarded and that piss me off.Now however that I have ranted about what I do not like about season 8 let me say what I do like. You still have the great character interactions and humor as in the other seasons. The Jaffa rebellion storyline get advanced and end up nicely, the storylines involving Baal and the replicators are good and as the hopeless romantic that I am I just love the way the relationship between Jack and Sam twists and turns. Me and my hubby watched all the season eight episodes over a few days and the DVD box was hard to put down.

The problem with the series by the time you get to season 8 is that the stories are the same (or very close to the same) as something from a previous season.  Whether it's the iminent attack on earth, the secret government organization threatening to shut down SG, a Goa-uld (sp?) infecting some high-level human with access to top secret information and shutting everybody out of the computer system, or the over-used time-travelling-changing-the-future-and-needing-to-be-fixed dilemna... most of the story ideas and plot twists have been done numerous times already.The fact that I don't anticipate watching a new episode at this point and haven't even watched the second half of the final episode says something about it losing the 'wow!' that made me love this series when I first discovered it a few months ago.  I may turn on the rest of the episode or look at seasons 9 & 10, but the flavor of the show is diminished.  I started looking at the other Stargates to find another with the same fresh feel as the first 6 seasons of SG-1, but it seems like even the cast has gotten bored with the series.  Season 8 seems like everybody involved is just going through the motions and not excited to be there anymore.  If you don't believe me, WATCH SOME EPISODE FROM SEASON 3 OR 4 AND WATCH THE SAME ACTOR IN AN EPISODE FROM SEASON 8.There are a couple of exceptions to this, but overall it's stale and the actors seem to have the same attitude about their roles.The series itself is overall great, but the fact that I have to force myself to sit through season 8 episodes and usually play them in the background while doing something else says a lot.Bottom line?The good: It's Stargate!The bad: It's the same Stargate...",3,Move along...there's nothing [new] to see here...,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,1744,"['love', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'problem', 'series', 'time', 'get', 'season', '8', 'stories', 'are', 'same', 'very', 'close', 'same', 'something', 'previous', 'season', 'iminent', 'attack', 'earth', 'secret', 'government', 'organization', 'threatening', 'shut', 'down', 'SG', 'Goa-uld', 'sp', 'infecting', 'high-level', 'human', 'access', 'top', 'secret', 'information', 'shutting', 'everybody', 'computer', 'system', 'over-used', 'time-travelling-changing-the-future-and-needing-to-be-fixed', 'dilemna', 'most', 'story', 'ideas', 'plot', 'twists', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'numerous', 'times', 'already.The', 'fact', 'do', ""n't"", 'anticipate', 'watching', 'new', 'episode', 'point', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'watched', 'second', 'half', 'final', 'episode', 'something', 'losing', ""'wow"", 'made', 'love', 'series', 'when', 'first', 'discovered', 'few', 'months', 'ago', 'may', 'turn', 'rest', 'episode', 'look', 'seasons', '9', '10', 'flavor', 'show', 'diminished', 'started', 'looking', 'other', 'Stargates', 'find', 'same', 'fresh', 'feel', 'first', '6', 'seasons', 'SG-1', 'even', 'cast', 'gotten', 'bored', 'series', 'Season', '8', 'everybody', 'involved', 'just', 'going', 'motions', 'not', 'excited', 'be', 'there', 'anymore', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'WATCH', 'SOME', 'EPISODE', 'FROM', 'SEASON', '3', 'OR', '4', 'AND', 'WATCH', 'THE', 'SAME', 'ACTOR', 'IN', 'AN', 'EPISODE', 'FROM', 'SEASON', '8.There', 'are', 'couple', 'exceptions', 'overall', 'stale', 'actors', 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'attitude', 'roles.The', 'series', 'overall', 'great', 'fact', 'have', 'force', 'sit', 'season', '8', 'episodes', 'usually', 'play', 'background', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'lot.Bottom', 'line', 'good', 'Stargate', 'bad', 'same', 'Stargate']",N/A

With no mention of it on the outer box, I wonder if they are downplaying it and don't want to admit the previous blunder.Anyway, this season was a very solid year for SG-1, and with the exception of the real dud, Avatar, where Teal'c gets stuck in a virtual reality device (oh, my, how many times have we had this storyline beaten to death in the sci-fi world), I enjoyed every episode. We had a healthy dose of humor injected episodes: Affinity, Prometheus Unbound, Zero Hour, and Citizen Joe. We had some team altering dramatics, including yet another death to an SG member. We had the return of old enemies (Anubis) and some new ones (the replicator Carter). And we also got an incredible finish of 5 startling epsidodes to end the season.I think that the high quality of the scripts and dramatic episodes helped take your mind of the loss of screen time for Richard Dean Anderson. His moments in the series though, were key, and his presence was well known. Even with less lines, he always managed to throw in his dry wit, especially to Baal in the Reckoning two parter.The series just keeps proving that it's high quality sci-fi, and well worth owning on DVD with the rest of the series.

290980,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,6302020190,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[1, 2]","The shakeup in personnel at Stargate Command may have been difficult for the crew but it was definitely an improvement for the television series. The early seasons were still trying to define what the show would be. The latter ones could be a bit stale. This one combines the excitement of the early seasons with the well developed cast of the latter seasons in a series of good plot lines. There are some changes to get used to. BG O'Neill commanding the SGC is just one. Teal'c having hair is the hardest for me to get used to.Episode synopses appear below:New Order Part 1 - Col. O'Neill managed to destroy Anubis and his fleet with the weapon of the ancients and thereby save the earth. It came at a cost. He was just barely alive and had to enter an Ancient's stasis field to keep from dying. SG1 wants to head off to procure help from the Asgard to revive O'Neill but there are political complications. The New civilian director of the SGC is more interested in placating civilian politicians than she is in helping O'Neill. Still, Maj. Carter convinces her to let herself and Teal'c go to the planet where they managed to bottle up the humanoid Replicators in hopes of finding Thor. They find him but they also encounter the replicator's breaking out and shaping a course for the new Asgard homeworld. They also manage to abduct Carter. Meanwhile, back on Earth, the Ghoul system Lords have sent a message. They want to negotiate a treaty for aid against Ba'al. The fact that earth managed to destroy Anubis has caught everyone's attention. They ghouls are their typical arrogant selves, though. Worse, they are not sure if the weapon is still online or if it was a one shot deal. The episode closes with a ghoul attack fleet preparing to test the matter.New Order Part 2 - Thor revives Col. O'Neill in the hope that the knowledge of the ancients within him will help his people to find a way to combat the replicators. Basically, his job description has been changed from saving the Earth on a weekly basis to saving the Galaxy and allied civilizations of a weekly basis. He gets a brigadier's star and a better parking place out of the deal. To collect on this deal, though, he still has to save the Asgard from the replicators and convince the Ghouls that attacking earth is a bad idea. He manages to get most of the replicators but the one who gets away does so with a chilling development. Much is this episode is very pat and the timing is suspicious and strains credulity but it is a fun one and it is nice to see the promotions.Lockdown - Anubis is a very tough character to kill. We assumed that having his fleet blown up with him in at the end of last season would do the job but we were wrong. Everyone forgot that he is an ""ascended being"" and little things like death do not slow him down. He manages to take control of a Russian cosmonaut who is assigned to SGC. He wants access to the Stargate so he can escape. The SGC team realizes this just in the nick of time and shuts down operations and quarantines the facility under Lockdown conditions. Now it's a waiting game. Daniel bets that if they wait long enough, Anubis will use some of his ascended powers and bring the wrath of the ancients upon himself. Meanwhile, they are stuck with a spectral ghoul who cannot be killed or captured.Zero Hour - The ostensible story line in this episode is that SGC, now commanded by Brigadier General O'Neill, has reason to believe that SG1, commanded by the newly minted LTC. Carter, has been captured by Ba'al. Ba'al even makes a personal appearance offering to trade for them. He wants the ghoul defector in exchange for SG1. The problem is that ghouls can't be trusted and O'Neill must make some difficult command decisions. The real story is that O'Neill is trying to settle into the command slot. He must deal with a host of irritating little details like alien plants taking over the base, recalcitrant trade negotiators and an impending visit by the president, all of which sap his energy and return to the composition of his resignation letter. It is well done.Icon - The SG1 team is unprepared when they visit a new planet to find that the local Stargate is set up outside a museum. Until their appearance,  the mythos surrounding the gate had been relegated to an outmoded religion practiced only by a few zealots. Now, the appearance of the SG1 team has destabilized the political situation and lent credence to the zealots' claims. A religious civil war ensues in which Daniel is caught on the planet. SGC has the devil of a time in trying to get him back and must ultimately take matters into their own hands.Avatar - The lab geeks come up with a virtual reality game to aide in the training of SG personnel. It is an advanced system that learns from its mistakes and gets better. Teal'c volunteers to try the system out. It works but there is a problem. Each time that Teal'c beats the system, it resets and gets harder. It will not end and let him out. It also gives his a little jolt of electricity each time he ""dies"" in the game. It is taking its toll and getting to the point where it is going to kill him. They cannot remove him forcibly from the game because doing so will also kill him. It seems like Teal'c is to be condemned to endlessly die in the game until he dies in reality.Affinity - Teal'c is finally being allowed to live off the base. This causes quite a stir because he is quite the model citizen. Crime drops dramatically around his apartment. He even takes up with the girl across the hall and teaches her to defend herself. The OSI doesn't like it. When the girl's former boyfriend turns up dead, Teal'c is the main suspect. SGC knows he is not to blame but it is hard to make the civil authorities see reason. They begin to take notice, though, when both the girl and Daniel Jackson turn up missing. It's those pesky, rogue NID agents running a freelance operation. Now, SGC has to shut them down, save the girl and Jackson and clear Teal'c.Covenant - It looks like the Stargate secret is out of the bag. A billionaire industrialist with lots of government contracts has managed to piece together bits of information and knows that something screwy is going on. He even has photos of the battle in space that ended last season. He also has some Asgard DNA and manages to clone one. This guy doesn't have any ulterior motives. He just believes in things like honesty and disclosure. He hold a press conference in which he announces that he has evidence that the government is keeping a big secret and threatens to reveal the secret if the governments do not come clean in 24 hours. Twenty four hours later, he produces a cloned asgard. SGC freaks and tries to get him to recant and keep the secret. Other people with lesser motive don't want him to disclose things either. Too much power and too much money argue for continued secrecy. Now the government faces a containment problem as it tries to keep everyone in the dark.Sacrifices - Ishta is the leader of the Jaffa women met last season. She is a high priestess of Moloch and leader of a resistance movement. She is eager to strike against the ghoul she is enslaved to and end his reign of terror and the practice of sacrificing female children. SGC agrees with her wishes but not her timing. They are looking at the bigger picture and an uprising of all Jaffa against all ghouls. Now, matters are coming to a head. Moloch has learned of the conspiracy and is moving against her and her people. They are evacuated to earth while LTC Carter tries to find a place to relocate them. Ishta and Teal'c are captured, though, and have no supply of the drug they depend on to replace the larval ghoul. The SGC must mount a rescue operation and contend with hotheads who want to act RIGHT NOW. Just to keep things extra tense, Teal'c's son, Rayac plans to marry one of Ishta's girls and daddy does not approve. This is one of the more action packed episodes of this season.Endgame - The rogue NID agents have shown up again. Actually, it's less a matter of them showing up than a matter of the Stargate disappearing from out of the middle of the SGC complex. The clues are few but all point to the rogues. The bad guys have found Osiris' ship and have used its transporter to steal the gate. They have also stolen a big batch of the Tok'ra nerve agent. They are sending rockets through he gate to kill as many ghouls and Jaffa as possible. Naturally, the Jaffa allied with SGC are pissed. They suspect a Tok'ra plot. SG1 must track down the rogues, capture the ship, stop the nerve attacks and stay alive while doing it. It's a normal day at work for SG1.Gemini - A few episodes back, the SG1 team defeated the humaniform replicators and their mechanical allies. At the end of that episode, we learned that the Replicator called ""Fifth"" had made a replica version of LTC Carter. This is the episode where everyone else finds out also. They find out when A message comes through the gate and has an out of date ID code of the Real Carter. When a drone is sent to investigate, Carter finds herself staring at an image of herself. The fake has a startling request. She wants to be killed and the SGC has the only weapon usable for the purpose. She cannot stand what Fifth is making her do. The SG personnel are suspicious but Carter points out how much intelligence they can gather and tries to convince the fake that they can protect her if they can get that intelligence. The others are suspicious of a trick. They think she might be working as an agent for Fifth. Fifth thinks the same thing. The truth is quite a bit more complex.Prometheus Unbound - Daniel Jackson is having a bad day. He wants to go on the Prometheus on the rescue mission for those sent to the Atlantis site. BG O'Neill won't let him go. He thinks he has won the day when LTG. Hammond shows up and says he is command of the mission and wants Daniel along. Daniel gets his way but is a bit put off by another member of the expedition. She is a female geek who is very bright but who gets a bad case of the hiccups when she is nervous. She spends a lot of time being nervous and she seems to have the hots for Daniel. These problems get put on the back burner when the Prometheus gets a distress call and goes to investigate. They find a ghoul ship damaged and with most of its inhabitants dead. An Anubis style super soldier is very much alive, though, and strands the crew of the Prometheus on the ghoul ship and steals the Prometheus with Daniel on board. Strangely, the super soldier does not kill Daniel and only zaps him. That is strange but Daniel gets really nervous when the killer makes a comment about Daniel being cute. It turns out, that his ship has been hijacked by a human woman wearing the armor of the super soldier. She gives a sob story about rescuing the last of her people and beats Daniel up on a regular basis as she is trying to be provocative. She turns out not to be a heroine but a simple pirate. Her lies get them into worse and worse trouble and Daniel has to save his ship, escape a bunch of enraged ghouls, get clear of her nefarious associates and keep from losing any sense of chivalry. It is a full day.It's Good to be King - The war between Ba'al and the system lords is not going well for most of the ghouls. They are looking around for previously abandoned planets to which they may retreat. One of these is the planet where the formal Col. Maybourne has found asylum after his misdeeds with the NID. Reluctantly, BG O'Neill agrees to send someone to rescue him. They find that he has set himself up as a king. Even stranger, his people love him. Strangest of all, he cares about his people. The basis for his power is an old monument of the ancients which is the basis for predicting the future. It was left behind as part of some ancient time travel experiments. One pf the prophecies details the current mess so the locals are expecting SG1. The key to success is an old ship of the Ancients. O'Neill must get it working before the forces of Ares take control.Full Alert - The rogue NID agents are back. The last time they were encountered was when one of their freelance plots to kill the ghouls and Jaffa was thwarted by SG1. One of their number managed to flee. Now, they are back and it is ugly. No longer are they waging an illicit campaign against the ghouls; they have been suborned by them. They want the governments of earth to destroy themselves in nuclear annihilation clearing the way for them to take the Atlantis weapon. Distrust is high and all military forces are at full alert. Everyone thinks the US government has been infiltrated by ghouls. The infiltration is elsewhere.Citizen Joe - It's budget crunch time. This episode is one of those retrospectives which features footage from previous episodes in a minimal story. The story, such as it is, involves Joe the barber. He buys a strange looking stone at a garage sale. When the stone is in his possession, he has visions of what SG1 is actually doing. This turns him from a boring guy into an interesting teller of stories. He becomes obsessed with the telling of these stories and eventually starts to write them down. He becomes so monomaniacal about doing so that his family leaves him. His life falls apart and he blames O'Neill and eventually goes after him. It is merely a cheap way to relive some action sequences from the past.Reckoning Part 1 - I suppose the last, low budget episode was a buildup to this one. Everyone gets to play. The Replicators, led by the replicate version of Samantha Carter is taking over the System Lords. It is only a matter of time before the ghouls are wiped out and the Replicators can take over the entire galaxy. The rebel Jaffa see this as an opportunity to attack their ancient temple and swing the rest of the Jaffa over to their cause. The Tok'ra believe this to be a lost cause. Ba'al turns out to be working not for himself but for Anubis. Thor and the Asgard are helping the real Carter to find a counter against the Replicators. The campaign of the rebel Jaffa starts off well enough but the replicate Carter find reason to head to their site to destroy it. Everybody thinks everybody else has been suckered into a trap.Reckoning Part 2 - Many of the loose ends of the series are tied up in this one. The rebel Jaffa have managed to take control of the temple that is central to their culture, thereby showing that the ghoul ""gods"" are not omnipotent. Ba'al and his fleet are closing in on the planet with the temple thinking that the Jaffa can be suppressed once and for all. Daniel Jackson is still in the hands of the replicate Carter who is trying to sift his mind for any clue to make her kind invulnerable. She knows that the only weapon which can defeat the Replicators is in that same temple so she has sent all of her forces there. The real Ltc. Carter and her father are in the Temple quickly deciphering away, trying to convert the weapon from something that will kill all life into something that will just affect the replicators. They will need Ba'al's help to get the job done but Ba'al has his own agenda. Anubis is hiding somewhere out of site but not quite out of mind. The stage is set for a truly great climax of epic proportion, one that seems like it is suitable for the end of a series, not just the end of a season and there are still a few episodes left!Threads - Daniel Jackson needs to stop getting killed so often. It's not healthy. It's not natural. It's supposed to be one per customer. He was killed at the end of the last episode in the climatic battle with the Replicators. Now, he is stuck in an other-worldly diner frequented by others who have ascended. Oma, the one who ascended him, is there as his waitress and there is a bothersome other customer who hangs around and drops hints about what is happening back in the real world. What is happening is not good. The Jaffa are consolidating their victory and striking out against what remains of Anubis' forces. They are being suckered into a trap. LTC Carter is trying to figure out her relationship with her fianc&eacute; and with BG O'Neill and the situation is complicated by the fact that her father is dying. There are plenty of weighty matters going on, both great and small, but they manage to get them fairly well sorted out by the end of the episode.Moebius Part 1 - The last few episodes did such a good job of cleaning up the galaxy that one may well wonder what is left for SGC to do. Well, it seems that the Ancient crystals that power the super weapon defenses are practically exhausted. Daniel Jackson finds a clue as to where one may be located. He thinks it is in ancient Egypt at the time of Ra, who does not know what it is. Their need is so great that the SGC decides to do what it has sworn never to do. They will use the Ancient ship found several episodes back to go back in time and steal the crystal from Ra, who does not realize what he has. They make it back and steal the crystal but their ship is discovered before they can leave for home. Now there is a great danger that they will change the course of history. They leave a video note to themselves to be found in the future to try to solve the dilemma. That concludes the first few minutes of the program. Then we are transported to the present day. In this alternate reality, the Stargate was never found and Jackson and Carter both have boring jobs. O'Neill is a drunk or the next thing too it. They are approached by the Air Force because their images appear on the ancient video tape that was recovered. It is up to them to find the gate and they are excited by the prospect of joining the adventurous but not yet extant SG1 The problem is that the USAF does not feel they are qualified to do any of the action stuff. The episode ends as it looks like the heroes are going to be cast aside.Moebius Part 2 - When the previous episode ended, the SG1 team had managed to screw up history so that Earth doesn't even know that the Stargate exists. A videotape alerts the Air Force to the possibilities and the alternate, geek versions of Jackson and Carter are recruited to find the gate and make it work. At the last minute, O'Neill is convinced to lead and expedition and he is convinced to take Carter and Jackson with him. They head for Chulak try and recruit the alternate Teal'c. Then, in a running battle with Apothis's jaffa, they too head back in time to try and repair the damage that was done. It can be a confusing pair of episodes if you don't pay attention but they are good ones.",5,Possibly the Best Stargate Season,1139961600,"02 15, 2006",2006,18588,"['shakeup', 'personnel', 'Stargate',

While there continued to be some fun things during the season, Year 8 had some of the very weakest stories in the series; and the last half of the season was clearly written with the objective of quickly resolving all unfinished business throughout the universe (i.e., killing off all the villains in one fell swoop) for the purpose of shutting the series down.  As in Seasons 6 and 7, we saw episodes creep in with thin and ill conceived cover stories as excuses to weave together scenes from past episodes, barely requiring the lead actors&#8217; time at all.

Reluctantly of course ""I have spent my life sticking it to the man and now I am the man.DVD 1: New Order Part 1 - In the aftermath of dealing with Anubis, there is the question of what about Jack.  We last left him in the stasis field which he entered in order to prevent the complete rewrite of his brain which of course meant death.  The idea is to contact Thor since he had erased Jacks prior knowledge load.  The problem is the new civilian commander, Dr. Elizabeth Weir.  Hammand would say go but she has other ideas as she is trying to find her way.  Eventually Teal'c and Carter head out but Carter gets abducted by the replicators.  Meanwhile back home the SGC gets a startling request.  The system lords want to discuss a treaty with earth.New Order Part 2 - Thor does his job and again revives Jack.  He also hopes Jack can come up with an ancient weapon design to deal with the replicators.  Dr. Weir leaves and Jack finally becomes a General.  He is not too sure as he once remarks ""I have spent my life sticking it to the man and now I am the man.""  On his first outing, he convinces the system lords that attacking earth is a bad idea and deals with the replicators.Lockdown - Anubis is back.  Being half ascended, he does not die with his fleet.  He sneaks around the SGC in ""cloud"" form taking over people as needed.  He tries to use the stargate to escape.  They lock it down but he eventually does escape.  However, it's not where he expected.Zero Hour - Brigadier General Jack O'Neill begins to wonder if he is really fit to command.  Too much pressure as Baal captures Carter and wants to trade for a Goa'uld defector as well as a plant that is tacking over the SGC and a negotiation between two parties that hate each other and the pending visit by the President.  During the show you see O'Neill writing his resignation letter while things are going on.  I liked his approach to dealing with the negotiation reps; he locks them in a room together until they can sort things out.  In the end he changes his mind and writes that on his letter.  Overall, it is a good ""warm"" story.DVD 2: Icon - SG1 visits a planet to find the stargate is in a museum.  Religion and myth surround the gate and their appearance destabilizes a nation in a world that is basically in a cold war.  Missiles are launched and the religious zealots take over.  Jackson is caught in the middle and decides he has to help to make up for what they did.Avatar - I thought this episode was a sales pitch for a new computer game but it was still interesting.  The scientists use alien technology to introduce virtual reality training for SG teams.  Teal'c is the tester and easily beats it.  He says so and they decide to use him to toughen up the game.  The game responded by making each round harder and gives Teal'c a shock each time he dies.  They can't unplug him as the device would kill him by the way it works.  They have to find a solution.  There is kind of a Groundhog Day feel to this but it was still interesting.Affinity - At first I thought this was a dream sequence when you see Teal'c in town stopping an assault (he beats the snot out of a group of hoods).  It seems he has been allowed to live off base and in his zealous desire to fit in he begins helping people and defends them if need be.  His neighbor has an abusive boyfriend and he visits to check her out which of course she was hit.  The BF mouths off and Teal'c tells him if he touches her again he will kill him where he stands  and then walks off.  The BF basically wets himself!  The girl walks up to him while he is in a park doing his Kata.  He decides to teach self-defense in order to boost her self-image.  The boyfriend later ends up dead and it looks like Teal'c did it.  Carter brings in her boyfriend to examine the case and his findings and the later disappearance of Jackson and Teal'cs neighbor tells the SGC he didn't do it.Covenant - A genius billionaire industrialist knows about SGC and wants the governments to confess what they are up to.  He thinks the world has a right to know they were almost wiped out.  He decides to prove it by producing an Azgard on TV.  Carter tries to convert him to the cause since he helped out in the past.  Even though he is excited by the alpha site and flying in a 302, he still plans to go on with his plans.DVD 3: Sacrifices - This one was fun.  Teal'c returns from a mission and Jack asks how it went.  Teal'c has a foul expression and announces that ""those he loves and trusts the most have betrayed him.""  Jack of course looks at him and says ""Oh that good.""  It is later explained that Rayac is planning to get married.  Ishta leader of the women warriors is back and leading a resistance against their former leader Moloch.  She wants to strike but the SGC doesn't want to help as they have plans for all Jaffa to rise up.  But when it's learned that Moloch is going to annihilate the women, Jack decides to give them sanctuary to the SGC and then does double takes as he sees horses walking around in the facility.  Teal'c and Ishta are later captured in a surprise attack.  Problems mount as they realize they don't have enough tritonan.  Overall a nice action episode!Endgame - It's the late shift and a new guy rambles about things which is broken up by the fact the stargate is teleported out.  The NID is back.  They have the gate, a modified  Tok'ra nerve agent and rockets to deliver the agent.  They use the agent to start wiping out the Goa'uld.  Never mind the fact that 10's of 1000's Jaffa also die in their strikes.  SG1 must stop the plot before the Jaffa allies get pissed at what they perceive is a Tok'ra plot.Gemini - The SGC gets a strange message with Carters old ID code.  They send a MALP and see Carter?  They quickly figure out she is a Replicator and are surprised by her request to die.  It turns out that she can't stand Fifth and reports he is planning to invade the galaxy.  Carter bonds with her for some reason and the rest of the SGC thinks the replicator is up to something.  Fifth for some reason thinks the same.  The ending is a little surprising.Prometheus Unbound -  Prometheus is going to look for Atlantis and Daniel Jackson wants to go.  O'Neill won't let him.  Hammand shows up and announces he is in command of the mission and is taking him.  He also takes Jacks office chair which he tells Jack to send it to Washington.  While on route they get a distress call and find a Hattak attack ship with all dead on board.  So they think.  A super soldier is there but what is strange is that it's not killing anybody.  In this episode we get to meet Vala played by Claudia Black.  She is a great character and she and Daniel have a great love/hate relationship.DVD 4:  It's Good to be King - The System Lords are getting beaten soundly by Baal.  They  start looking at abandoned planets to hide and rebuild.  One targeted planet became a home for Col. Maybourne.  It's decided it's a bad idea to let the Goa'uld get a hold of him since his knowledge would be a disaster for earth if he was ever mind probed.  A retrieval team is sent to get him.  They find he has set himself up as king and seer for the people.  What is shocking is the fact he cares for his people and they him.  It later comes out there is an ancient ruin and he taught himself to read inscriptions that is a timeline of events that happen and will happen.  An ancient time traveled and left a log of what he saw.  One message speaks of the saviors that will come.  O'Neill needs to find a ship and get it working to deal with the Goa'uld arrival.Full Alert - The agents that escaped in Osiris' ship have returned.  This time they are Goa'uld.  They have a plan to annihilate the earth and it's effective.  The US government has been infiltrated by the Goa'uld.Citizen Joe - This was one of those OK? type of episodes.  A man played by Dan Castalenta (homer simpson) starts having visions of SG1.  His life falls apart as he finds himself compelled to write everything down.  After loosing his home, he decides Jack has to pay.There is humor in the episode but as I mentioned why did they do it?  Probably the funniest part is when they realize there are two stones and both owners will share visions.  It appears Jack has had visions of a barber in Indiana for 7 years.  Daniel asks him didn't he find it strange and Jack tells them he found it soothing.  They all look at him like he is nuts.Reckoning Part 1 - Replicator Carter appears at the to the system lords as Baals representative is trying to get them to give up the fight.  She brings Carter out and makes an accusation of duplicity.  The replicator shows her intent by running Lord Yu through and then proceeds to kill them all(not shown).  This was a rather strange way to eliminate most of the Goa'uld.We also discover there is a world were the Jaffa first become servant warriors to the Goa'uld.  Teal'c decides if they can take it from Baal who is busy fighting and loosing to the replicators, they can swing the Jaffa to the cause as a God could not hold a sacred world.The Jaffa take the planet and repliacator Carter takes Daniel Jackson.  Anubis appears and orders Baal to retake the planet.Reckoning Part 2 - When I saw this episode I saw what appears to be the end of the series in play.  The Jaffa have taken the temple which shows all Jaffa the Goa'uld are not Gods.  The system lords were wiped out.  Baal is about to attack and wipe out the rebels and the replicators are about to attack after Replicator Carter learns about the weapon from Daniel.  The weapon is found and Carter, Jacob and Selmac are trying to figure out how to make it work.  They have to enlist the help of Baal who gladly helps when he sees his fleeting getting annihilated by the Replicator fleet.  Daniel eventually starts taking control of Replicator Carter and she kills him.  The weapon is fired and the replicators are gone.Threads - Daniel Jackson appears in a supernatural dinner and finds Oma is his waitress.  He thinks he has ascended but learns he has not and he must choose as there will not be a third time.  There is also this annoying customer that seems to piss off Oma every chance he can get.  There are side stories where Carter is trying to figure out whom she wants and it appears the Jaffa are about to get suckered into a trap.  On top of that Carter learns that her father is dying.  I always wondered about the bit were Daniel tried to fight Anubis while ascended and lost.  You get to see why here and take a good look at the fight scene that they show.  Oma is there.More wrap up for the series?Moebius Part 1 - This 2 part was a strange episode.  The ancient weapon on earth is low on power and Daniel discovers they probably could get another if they time travel back to the time of Ra.  You would think after Star Trek they would understand that messing with the time line is a bad thing.  Problems happen and they decide to hide out and hope they don't mess up the timeline.  Of course things change.  Daniel Jackson is a nerd who teaches English classes to get buy.  Carter has a sexy librarian action going as an unrecognized genius in a male dominated job.  Jack is a retired drunk boat operator and Teal'c is still with Apothis.  Jackson and Carter are approached by the air force who show them a tape made by SG1 that is discovered on a dig.  They decide they need to find that gate and find the original was taken by RA when he left the planet.  However, there is one more.  After locating it, the air force says they are going to discharge the services of Carter and Jackson.Moebius Part 2 -  O'Neill appears and it's decided to head to Chulak and get Teal'c.  He decided that Carter and Jackson must come.  They pick up Teal'c and head back to ancient Egypt hopeful to correct the time line.This was a strange episode especially when there was no cliff hanger.  Somebody later told me they do this because they think the series is going to be cancelled.  Don't know if it is true.

Season 8 wraps up all the storylines from the past few years, including the gaould, replicators, and some others.  And it wraps them up well.  I was surprised how a series 8 seasons in could still be so gripping and entertaining.  Most shows would have just churned out more of the same, but this season really pushed the envelope.  Well, except for Richard Dean Anderson, who was mostly phoning it in this season.  Also, the last two episodes seemed out of place as the story clearly ended during the third to last episode.  The last two feel almost as if they were done to complete a contract rather than actually forward a story.Overally, I was impressed with Stargate season 8.  I liked the feeling that this show truly ended the series, and wrapped up a number of storylines.  If you've enjoyed the show before, there's plenty to love about this season.

O'Neill was taking over for Hammond but nobody really took over for O'Neill.

THis was a pretty good season however and I think every Stargate fan should add this to their collection.About the DVD. Once again there is some defect with the DVD. At least Threads plays because season's 6 and 7 had defects and Stargate Atlantis has a defect. You'd think they would have caught this problem already and started treating loyal fans with a little respect. I find it kind of ironic that the seasons that aired on the Sci-fi channel have had the defects, and maybe that has something to do with it. MGM has heard our cries and they are fixing the problem.

291023,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302020190,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","Season Eight of STARATE SG-1 was in many ways one of transition.  Richard Dean Anderson was beginning to end his involvement with the show, but having him sorta in-sorta out upset the balance of the SG-1 team and created an absence at the heart of the show.  Over the previous seven seasons, the four members of the SG-1 team had developed considerable chemistry and contributed uniquely to balancing the cast.  Despite being a colonel, O'Neill excelled at shooting from the hip and injecting verbal anarchy into things.  Sam was always great for the scientific take on things, while Daniel brought an equally scholarly but more historical and humane take on things.  Teal'c, meanwhile, brought a Stoic, almost Spartan, slant to the show.  But with O'Neill spending most of his time on base as the new head of SG-1, the chemistry was off.  This was corrected in Season Nine with Ben Browder--who brought many of the same qualities to the show as Richard Dean Anderson--joining the cast.  But in Season Eight, things just aren't quite right.Not that this interfered with the writing.  The ongoing saga of the struggle between humans and their allies against the Goa'uld and the Replicators reached new levels, with the good guys pretty achieving close to final victory against each.  But for the first time a few of the episodes were a bit flat and uninspired.  STARGATE SG-1's greatest virtue has long been the remarkable consistency of its writing and the continuance of the increasingly complex core mythology.  It may have lacked the narrative richness of FARSCAPE or the depth of character development of FIREFLY, but it had the great advantage of producing a staggering number of very good episodes.  If its peaks weren't as high as FARSCAPE, its valleys weren't nearly as low (as much as I adore FARSCAPE, which I consider the best Sci-fi series ever, it had some real clunker episodes to go along with some masterpieces).  But in Season Eight, we saw for the first time some episodes that simply weren't very good.  Luckily, Season Nine would see a return to form.Hints of good things to come came in the episode ""Prometheus Unbound,"" in which the character of Vala Mal Doran was introduced.  Claudia Black, who plays Vala and who appeared on FARSCAPE as Aeryn Sun, is introduced in this episode in a way that pays homage to FARSCAPE.  Just as John Crichton first thinks Aeryn Sun is a man before she removes the helmet of her solid black suit, so Daniel Jackson thinks she is a man before she removes her helmet.  That is where the comparisons between the two characters end.  If Aeryn Sun is disciplined, militaristic, self-denying, repressed, and stern, Vala is feisty, unscrupulous, slutty, tricky, and fun loving.  It is as if Claudia Black decided she wanted to do her own version of FARSCAPE's Chiana.  The episode is not one of the more important episodes in terms of narrative, but in terms of fun, it is hands down the best episode of the season.  The chemistry between Daniel and Vala is great, not primarily sexually but interpersonally, as if each possesses in abundance the qualities the other lacks.  Vala was easily one of the best guest characters in the first eight seasons of the show.  Luckily, it was decided to have Claudia Black revive Vala as a fulltime character starting Season Nine, although that was interrupted by a real life pregnancy.  She has, however, returned as an opening credits character in Season Ten.  The show's writers have done, however, a very smart thing in keeping Vala more closely linked to Daniel Jackson than Col. Mitchell, played by Ben Browder.  Though there have been a couple of subtle jokes passed between Black and Browder (such as Vala looking at him the first time she is in her presence and wondering if they had met before), the two have more or less been left un-paired.  (For those who have not seen FARSCAPE, the series in large part revolved around the star-crossed romance between Black's Aeryn Sun and Browder's John Crichton.  Their romance is not merely the great TV Sci-fi romance of all time, but makes many fan and critic lists of the all time great TV romances of any genre.)  But in all this I anticipate Seasons 9 and 10.The main plot developments in Season 8 centers on the victories over the enemies of the first eight seasons.  In a way, it also largely ends the show as we have known it.  I'm almost tempted to called Seasons 1-8 STARGATE SG-1 Part I and Seasons 9-10 STARGATE SG-1 Part II, so many things change.  Season 8 is Richard Dean Anderson's last as a full time cast member, the final season in which the Replicators and the Goa'uld function as the major enemies (though Baal manages to survive, it isn't at all clear that the Goa'uld will ever manage to play a major role on the show again), and the beginning of the shift of the show from Egyptian and Norse mythology in the first eight seasons to Arthurian mythology in subsequent ones.  After this season the show--called by many FARGATE for the changes in the cast--would focus on the Ori instead of the Goa'uld.  There would be one further change in the show.  For the first eight seasons, STARGATE told an ongoing narrative, but it did so through what were essentially self-contained episodes.  In Season 9 it would become more and more serial in structure, with one episode more or less picking up on what happened the previous week.  There is no question that the serial form is superior to the episode form.  Network executives detest the serial form because it makes it difficult to attract new viewers.  But given the extreme maturity of STARGATE, perhaps the Sci-fi Channel feels that the show is unlikely to attract new viewers and has permitted the transition to a serial in order to retain the viewers it already has.So, in some ways this season is the ending of the show as we have known it.  And a very good run it has been.  What has kept the show going has been a willingness to continually grow and change.  And I'm confident that it is what will keep the show going for a few more seasons.",4,A transition season that brings the original show to an end,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",2006,6055,"['Season',

While it wasn't the true end of the show, it was the end of the primary story arch which features Jack O'Neill, Samantha Carter, Daniel Jackson, and Teal'c.  This was a truly enjoyable send-off, elegantly touching on many fine points and characters which gate travelers will appreciate.  Kawalski, an old friend, features again, as well as our old beloved Hammond.  The Goa'uld are all but defeated, along with the Replicators, and Earth finally has a new starship all its own (the Daedalus class battleships). Jack and Sam finally get together (albeit in an alternate timeline), and the prime reality Jack finally gets fish in his pond.  The references to Gate Ships and ZPMs pass the torch nicely to the sister series, Atlantis.  While this isn't the last adventure of SG-1, it is a fond farewell to the first, and best, era of Stargate: SG-1.  The chemistry in this core cast of four, in my opinion, has never been matched on a science fiction television series.  I encourage others to watch the remaining two seasons of SG-1, as well as the two feature films and Atlantis--for all Stargate material is fun and enjoyable (I haven't seen Universe yet).  The core eight seasons of SG-1 are the capstones of this fun franchise, made possible by the good staff of writers and directors, as well as (of course) Richard Dean Anderson, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, and Michael Shanks.I will fondly remember the last scene of the original SG-1 team era: the four true friends, enjoying their friendship and trust together.  And that is what the show was truly about: the unstoppable force that saw SG-1 through all of their impossibly difficult challenges: their bond of trust and friendship.  Who says Science Fiction can't impart good lessons?A final word: Stargate may be a rather silly franchise in many ways, but it's multi-dimensional, has characters that are easily liked, and it has great, often self-effacing humor (not to mention all the sci-fi action, espionage, intrigue, and fantasy elements that kept me coming back for more every time)!",5,An excellent end to a wonderful era in Sci-Fi Television,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2012,2176,"['creators', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'may', 'have', 'supposed', 'magnificent', 'series', 'was', 'going', 'end', 'two-part', 'episode', 'was', ""n't"", 'true', 'end', 'show', 'was', 'end', 'primary', 'story', 'arch', 'Jack', ""O'Neill"", 'Samantha', 'Carter', 'Daniel', 'Jackson', 'Teal', 'c', 'was', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'send-off', 'elegantly', 'touching', 'many', 'fine', 'points', 'characters', 'gate', 'travelers', 'will', 'appreciate', 'Kawalski', 'old', 'friend', 'features', 'again', 'as', 'well', 'old', 'beloved', 'Hammond', ""Goa'uld"", 'are', 'defeated', 'Replicators', 'Earth', 'finally', 'new', 'starship', 'own', 'Daedalus', 'class', 'battleships', 'Jack', 'Sam', 'finally', 'get', 'together', 'albeit', 'alternate', 'timeline', 'prime', 'reality', 'Jack', 'finally', 'fish', 'pond', 'references', 'Gate', 'Ships', 'ZPMs', 'pass', 'torch', 'nicely', 'sister', 'series', 'Atlantis', ""n't"", 'last', 'adventure', 'SG-1', 'fond', 'farewell', 'first', 'best', 'era', 'Stargate', 'SG-1', 'chemistry', 'core', 'cast', 'four', 'opinion', 'never', 'been', 'matched', 'science', 'fiction', 'television', 'series', 'encourage', 'others', 'watch', 'remaining', 'two', 'seasons', 'SG-1', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'feature', 'films', 'Atlantis', 'Stargate', 'material', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Universe', 'yet', 'core', 'eight', 'seasons', 'SG-1', 'are', 'capstones', 'fun', 'franchise', 'made', 'possible', 'good', 'staff', 'writers', 'directors', 'as', 'well', 'course', 'Richard', 'Dean', 'Anderson', 'Amanda', 'Tapping', 'Christopher', 'Judge', 'Michael', 'Shanks.I', 'will', 'fondly', 'remember', 'last', 'scene', 'original', 'SG-1', 'team', 'era', 'four', 'true', 'friends', 'enjoying', 'friendship', 'trust', 'together', 'what', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'unstoppable', 'force', 'saw', 'SG-1', 'impossibly', 'difficult', 'challenges', 'bond', 'trust', 'friendship', 'Who', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'ca', ""n't"", 'impart', 'good', 'lessons', 'final', 'word', 'Stargate', 'may', 'be', 'rather', 'silly', 'franchise', 'many', 'ways', 'multi-dimensional', 'characters', 'are', 'easily', 'liked', 'great', 'often', 'self-effacing', 'humor', 'not', 'mention', 'sci-fi', 'action', 'espionage', 'intrigue', 'fantasy', 'elements', 'kept', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'time']",N/A

Yet you people are angry because of that!?!?! They ended the Replicators and freed the Jaffa because the plots were becoming the same thing over and over again, and they would always win.
