1344841,A3VFRG9YVQCUWO,B003G4CWQM,Dan (aka THXkid),"[138, 144]","1st let me say the 1st movies them selves are fantastic, but not on this horrible set where sullivan entertainment has lied to us all, they say this is widescreen from the original 35mm, BS, all they did was take the original 4x3 from the 1st 2 movies zoomed up and cropped the top and bottom, I have the remastered set from 2008 and its soooo much better, this one is soft, bad color and your missing a good 25% of the viewing as they cropped it off, how do I know this a scene with matthew has him reading the farmers almanac where you can actually read the name in the 4x3 original version same scene in this so called remastered version that book is cut off, if this was really shot in 16x9 35mm widescreen not only would you see all the picture from the original 4x3 but also an extra 25% on each side where if originally shot in 16x9 then pan and scan for 4x3 TV would have cut off the side, but no back in 1986 and 1988 when this was shot he had no idea of going beyond TV so it was shot like every other TV movie or mini series back then in 4x3, but to lie about it, never buy from these scums again, now the last 2 movies since they were much newer was originally shot in 16x9 and the do benefit from the remaster, but to dupe the public into thinking your getting something more with this so called remastered versions of movies 1 and 2, when your actually getting less than you had in the 4x3 versions, pitiful. also anyone giving thisn3 stars and above have no idea was a true remaster is or what it takes to truly remaster to a quality of today standards and probably dont own a blu ray player and nice high end HDTV to see the benefits or short comings of a remaster, you want good remaster look no further than star trek the original series blu ray, next gen seasons 1-3, sound of music, gone with the wind, wizard of oz, blade runner, superman 1 and 2(original not the cheap remakes) and yes it cost a million or more a movie to do so, quite a bit more for star trek but the benefits and quality is there, unlike this poor excuse for a so called remastered version of anne, and sad as the 1st 2 movies are some of the best movies ever released story wise, nope glad I kept ""1/2 the price of this"" 2008 version which blows this overly price pile away. yeah never gonna see this on blu ray, looks this bad on 480p DVD, 1080p would look like a VHS copy, Fuzzy, blurry, color off set but he claimed he remastered it in HD.",1,Sullivan entertinment are liars,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2434,"['1st', 'let',

1344843,ALOBDM0WA37DA,B003G4CWQM,Jr.,"[33, 35]","I love the first two Anne of Green Gables films. I first viewed them on PBS and had the original VHS tapes released by Disney. The first few DVD releases by Sullivan were of very poor audio and visual quality. This new - expensive - set gathers the four films together, all in 16x9 widescreen. I do not like the other two films, so I will comment only on the first two.These were originally filmed in 4x3 format, with television in mind (I read that they may have played theatrically overseas). I'm not an expert, but these new widescreen formats do look cropped. So, information is lost with these new transfers. Is that so bad? Yes, because I feel the original aspect ratios of these films should be 4x3 (or 1.33:1) as they were originally broadcasted. Worse though, the image quality seems to be so digitally scrubbed that a lot of detail that was originally visible is no longer visible. The audio seems OK; the default is the original 2.0 stereo mix. Annoyingly, the closed captioning seems to have been done by nitwits. For the first film, the first disc (thankfully, each movie has two discs) has fairly good captioning. The second disc has the captioning all IN FULL CAPS, and is rife with errors. Very poor quality!! At this price point, I would not recommend fans to rebuy these films if they are already owned. However, as an FYI, I contacted Sullivan Entertainment and they said they have no plans to release the films on blu-ray.",2,A Review of the new Widescreen Anne DVD set,1345852800,"08 25, 2012",2012,1442,"['love', 'first', 'two', 'Anne', 'Green', 'Gables', 'films', 'first', 'viewed', 'PBS', 'had', 'original', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'released', 'Disney', 'first', 'few', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Sullivan', 'were', 'very', 'poor', 'audio', 'visual', 'quality', 'new', 'expensive', 'set', 'gathers', 'four', 'films', 'together', '16x9', 'widescreen', 'do', 'not', 'other', 'two', 'films', 'will', 'comment', 'only', 'first', 'two.These', 'were', 'originally', 'filmed', '4x3', 'format', 'television', 'mind', 'read', 'may', 'have', 'played', 'theatrically', 'overseas', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'new', 'widescreen', 'formats', 'do', 'look', 'cropped', 'So', 'information', 'lost', 'new', 'transfers', 'so', 'bad', 'Yes', 'feel', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratios', 'films', 'should', 'be', '4x3', '1.33:1', 'were', 'originally', 'broadcasted', 'Worse', 'image', 'quality', 'be', 'so', 'digitally', 'scrubbed', 'lot', 'detail', 'was', 'originally', 'visible', 'no', 'longer', 'visible', 'audio', 'OK', 'default', 'original', '2.0', 'stereo', 'mix', 'Annoyingly', 'closed', 'captioning', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'nitwits', 'first', 'film', 'first', 'disc', 'thankfully', 'movie', 'two', 'discs', 'fairly', 'good', 'captioning', 'second', 'disc', 'captioning', 'IN', 'FULL', 'CAPS', 'rife', 'errors', 'Very', 'poor', 'quality', 'price', 'point', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'fans', 'rebuy', 'films', 'are', 'already', 'owned', 'However', 'FYI', 'contacted', 'Sullivan', 'Entertainment', 'said', 'have', 'plans', 'release', 'films', 'blu-ray']",Anne of Green Gables: The Complete Four-Part Collection
