I kept putting it off and finally gave in and set up to record it on my DVR. We sat down and she admitted she had only heard it while cooking, so it was new to ""see"" for her too. The next morning, she came downstairs and found me watching it again. I couldn't believe how PERFECT it was, so I looked it up on Amazon, not believing such a great Christian movie would be available, but there it was. Knowing how much I'd want to loan it out, I purchased two copies. One to keep at home and one to loan to friends. This is BEYOND awesome. It is Godly. Must have for any Christian video library. I also recommend the rest of the trilogy (The Perfect Stranger and Another Perfect Stranger) as well as The Stranger miniseries.",5,Having on my DVR wasn't enough!,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",2011,806,"['wife', 'stumbled', 'Christmas', '2010', 'kept', 'telling', 'had', 'watch', 'kept', 'putting', 'off', 'finally', 'gave', 'set', 'up', 'record', 'DVR', 'sat', 'down', 'admitted', 'had', 'only', 'heard', 'cooking', 'was', 'new', 'see', 'too', 'next', 'morning', 'came', 'downstairs', 'found', 'watching', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'PERFECT', 'was', 'looked', 'up', 'Amazon', 'not', 'believing', 'such', 'great', 'Christian', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'available', 'was', 'Knowing', 'how', 'much', ""'d"", 'want', 'loan', 'purchased', 'two', 'copies', 'One', 'keep', 'home', 'one', 'loan', 'friends', 'BEYOND', 'awesome', 'Godly', 'Must', 'have', 'Christian', 'video', 'library', 'also', 'recommend', 'rest', 'trilogy', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'Perfect', 'Stranger', 'as', 'well', 'Stranger', 'miniseries']",N/A

Jefferson Moore who has been in another movie we like, plays Jesse, whom one soon realizes is a lot like Jesus in more ways than one. Christina Fougnie plays Max (Maxine) who comes from a single parent home, and like many young girls her age is very focused on herself.There's more than one message in this movie. Like her mother who is in an executive position working long hours and then put in charge of the Winter celebration, which is named Winter so as not to offend anyone.  She does a great job of doing what more people should do, when it comes to changing winter celebrations back to Christmas celebrations. And making the office celebration a Christmas one where workers and their families come together and instead of expensive liquor and food, simple food and gifts for the children from the homeless shelter nearby.And in keeping with what seems to be happening more and more they have a man who has an organization that doesn't want any mention or display of Christ mentioned, even if its on a church property, which happens to be within the town limits. Guess I loved the movie because it also showed how and why Christians should fight back in stopping the anti Christian furor that rears its ugly head every December.And i loved how the movie in a very subtle way, addresses the reason why some mainline denominations are losing members. A message more Ministers, Pastors, should pay attention to.Would this movie win any Oscars? No. But that's not why it was made.",5,Great messages within this little gem,1321833600,"11 21, 2011",2011,1565,"['Watched', 'movie', 'television', 'nice', 'family', 'movie', 'good', 'message', 'Jefferson', 'Moore', 'who', 'been', 'movie', 'like', 'plays', 'Jesse', 'whom', 'one', 'soon', 'lot', 'Jesus', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Christina', 'Fougnie', 'Max', 'Maxine', 'who', 'single', 'parent', 'home', 'many', 'young', 'girls', 'age', 'very', 'focused', 'more', 'one', 'message', 'movie', 'mother', 'who', 'executive', 'position', 'working', 'long', 'hours', 'then', 'put', 'charge', 'Winter', 'celebration', 'named', 'Winter', 'so', 'not', 'offend', 'anyone', 'great', 'job', 'doing', 'what', 'more', 'people', 'should', 'do', 'when', 'changing', 'winter', 'celebrations', 'back', 'Christmas', 'celebrations', 'making', 'office', 'celebration', 'Christmas', 'one', 'where', 'workers', 'families', 'come', 'together', 'instead', 'expensive', 'liquor', 'food', 'simple', 'food', 'gifts', 'children', 'homeless', 'shelter', 'nearby.And', 'keeping', 'what', 'be', 'happening', 'more', 'more', 'have', 'man', 'who', 'organization', ""n't"", 'want', 'mention', 'display', 'Christ', 'mentioned', 'even', 'church', 'property', 'be', 'town', 'limits', 'Guess', 'loved', 'movie', 'also', 'showed', 'how', 'why', 'Christians', 'should', 'fight', 'back', 'stopping', 'anti', 'Christian', 'furor', 'ugly', 'head', 'December.And', 'i', 'loved', 'how', 'movie', 'very', 'subtle', 'way', 'reason', 'why', 'mainline', 'denominations', 'are', 'losing', 'members', 'message', 'more', 'Ministers', 'Pastors', 'should', 'pay', 'attention', 'movie', 'Oscars', 'No', 'not', 'why', 'was', 'made']",N/A

If you have spoiled your children the way the world says is ok to do, you and your kids have to watch this movie.  This movie has no cursing, sex, and no crude humor.  What this movie does have is a young girl who has been given every material thing to keep her occupied so she would stay out of her parents hair, much like most kids in our society today.  She had been given everything except the most important thing; she had not been taught the truth about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.In this movie, her rich parents divorce and she ends up living with her mom who gets the lower end of the stick, which equals up to the bare necessities to include a regular job (for income), an apartment with lights and running water (for shelter), food on the go (nourishment for the physical body), clothes (so they wouldn't be indecently exposed), and nothing extra.  The extra is where is the issues lie.This little girl has the biggest attitude because she has been reduced to living like normal people, and she doesn't know how to handle it until she's introduced to Jesus Christ, incognito, known as Jess.  To make a long story short, after spending a very short time with ""Jess"", the little girl's attitude disappears and her character has done a 180.  Now that's the power of Jesus, live and in action.Every family must see this movie.

This one perhaps did it better than any of the others I've seen. The topic has been covered pretty thoroughly I think.
