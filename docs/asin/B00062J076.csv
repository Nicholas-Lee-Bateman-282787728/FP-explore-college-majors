I set my alarm for 3 a.m. years ago to put in a last-minute eBay bid for ""The Sound of Music"" that was being sold by a guy in Hong Kong. I won. The resultant DVD was obviously duped from a bad TV format 16mm print. The color and sound changed from reel to reel. I mention all this to emphasize the totally crappy quality of this DVD. As others have mentioned, it looks like it was dubbed from a bad VHS copy, which, I suspect, was probably made from somebody's homemade recording when this otherwise fun and enjoyable romp was first aired. As for the packaging, I've seen better efforts by high school kids at producing something ""professional"" in PhotoShop. Bad scans, mottled background, and cheesy layout do not make the box an added asset to my DVD shelves. It's sad that either the collection of UNCLE movies available in the U.K. or the excellent 40-something-disc DVD ""Man From UNCLE"" set (available only from Time-Life until this fall) doesn't include ""Return of..."" as an ""extra."" Until it comes out ""officially,"" staunch fans are stuck with this shoddy piece of clabber, much as I suffered through that lousy Asian bootleg of ""The Sound of Music"" until it was officially released.UPDATE: A legit version was released in March 2009. Channel D is open once again, in a much better, professional release.

I was excited to see that it was released on DVD, and preordered it when I saw it was about to be released. I just watched the first 20 minutes, and was really disappointed.  The video quality is very poor.  It appears to be a recording from an old VCR, as the picture shakes back and forth enough to be really annoying.  When Janice Friday is introduced, we are all introduced to the new ""enhanced sound,"" whatever that means.  Problem is, there is no sound at all for about five seconds.  I may never watch the rest of the DVD, as the tape is actually superior in quality.The video is not clean, and the sound is certainly less than advertised.  I believe they made this in someone's garage.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is ""The Man from UNCLE.""

Wrong!  What we do get is this poorly manufactured, pathetic excuse of an issue of what could have been a fun movie although it does pale in comparison to the original series.I was pleased to see in another review that the sound blanks out for 5 seconds at one point - at least I know it wasn't my copy.  And if you haven't gotten this yet - be prepared - the sound will go out again later in the movie as well.From a technical standpoint, it seems a first-year college film student could have done a better job.Technical goof-ups aside, what we have here just merely whets the appetite for all the U.N.C.L.E. fans who are waiting for the original TV series and it's better than nothing.  Here's hoping that when the powers that be do get around to issuing the original TV series on DVD (make it soon Lord, make it soon - those of us who were in our late teens/early 20's when the original series aired aren't getting any younger!), they'll also re-release this movie.
