I was around with the show was in it's third season, but not when it started, so I wasn't able to watch the entire show. I didn't know anything about the show's character development, and I just thought it was just a stupid show. I saw a rerun recently and thought it was HILARIOUS. I loved it... It was like, one of the best TV comedies I've seen, seriously. I would  recommend this to anyone. I'm not even joking. I liked the way the packaging was, I thought it would have both seasons in one combo pack, but they were separate DVD cases with each season in both of them. I really enjoy it and think everyone should watch it, even though it's an older show.",5,I just got this about 2 weeks ago...,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,771,"['could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'how', 'fast', 'got', 'here', 'loved', 'shipping', 'time', 'btw', 'actual', 'product', 'loved', 'was', 'around', 'show', 'was', 'third', 'season', 'not', 'when', 'started', 'was', ""n't"", 'able', 'watch', 'entire', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'show', 'character', 'development', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'stupid', 'show', 'saw', 'rerun', 'recently', 'thought', 'was', 'HILARIOUS', 'loved', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'seriously', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'joking', 'liked', 'way', 'packaging', 'was', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'seasons', 'one', 'combo', 'pack', 'were', 'separate', 'DVD', 'cases', 'season', 'really', 'enjoy', 'think', 'everyone', 'should', 'watch', 'even', 'older', 'show']",Friends: Seasons 1 and 2

The quality is what I expected, if you are a fan of friends and never picked up the seasons as they came out but want to watch the show, this is a great buy.

One thing I particularly like is the fact on these seasons have extended episodes that Blu-ray versions DO NOT include! Half these scenes and episodes we not even shown on TV, so its a nice perk to buy the DVD versions instead of the Blu-rays.
