1422777,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B004O8OLNQ,Amanda Richards,"[0, 3]","""If you had my loveAnd I gave you all my trustWould you comfort meAnd if somehow you knew that your love would be untrueWould you lie to me""(Jennifer Lopez)Short attention span summary:1. Internet love is blind2. Impressionable teenager finds love with sweet talking stranger of variable age.3. The inevitable occurs4. Father doesn't always know best5. All's not well, and doesn't end well.Fourteen year old Annie ignores her little inner voice of reason, and even though she is uncomfortable that her on-line ""boyfriend"" is much older than he first admitted, she falls for his flattery and ego-boosting compliments with horrifying consequences.  When it is later revealed that she has been well and truly deceived into thinking that ""Charlie"" loves her, her rude awakening shatters her fragile self-esteem.Her father naturally wants to go out and kill somebody in retaliation, and some of his actions, though understandable, are rather extreme, which put a further strain on the family.  Annie bears the burden of the pressure from family and her peers, and as can be expected, peers can be very cruel to each other.This well-acted movie opens the doors for family discussion on the subject of internet chat rooms and the dangers of on-line hook-ups.  It also shows that there are predators lurking around every corner, and emphasizes the need to educate your children about disclosing information to strangers and believing that everything they hear is the truth.My only quibble is the abrupt ending, which patches up one troubled relationship, but leaves all others hanging.  The clip during the credits reveals that life goes on regardless.""Some lovers just rely on their heartsThe core remains of what began with a passionate startAnd they may not want it to endBut it will, it's just a question of when""(Billy Joel)Amanda Richards, August 1, 2011",4,In love we trust,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,1852,"['had', 'loveAnd', 'gave', 'trustWould', 'comfort', 'meAnd', 'somehow', 'knew', 'love', 'would', 'be', 'untrueWould', 'lie', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'Short', 'attention', 'span', 'summary:1', 'Internet', 'love', 'blind2', 'Impressionable', 'teenager', 'finds', 'love', 'sweet', 'talking', 'stranger', 'variable', 'age.3', 'inevitable', 'occurs4', 'Father', ""n't"", 'always', 'know', 'best5', 'not', 'well', ""n't"", 'end', 'well.Fourteen', 'year', 'old', 'Annie', 'little', 'inner', 'voice', 'reason', 'even', 'uncomfortable', 'on-line', 'boyfriend', 'much', 'older', 'first', 'admitted', 'flattery', 'ego-boosting', 'compliments', 'horrifying', 'consequences', 'When', 'later', 'revealed', 'been', 'well', 'truly', 'deceived', 'thinking', 'Charlie', 'rude', 'awakening', 'shatters', 'fragile', 'self-esteem.Her', 'father', 'naturally', 'go', 'out', 'kill', 'somebody', 'retaliation', 'actions', 'understandable', 'are', 'rather', 'extreme', 'put', 'further', 'strain', 'family', 'Annie', 'burden', 'pressure', 'family', 'peers', 'can', 'be', 'expected', 'peers', 'can', 'be', 'very', 'cruel', 'other.This', 'well-acted', 'movie', 'doors', 'family', 'discussion', 'subject', 'internet', 'chat', 'rooms', 'dangers', 'on-line', 'hook-ups', 'also', 'are', 'predators', 'lurking', 'around', 'corner', 'need', 'educate', 'children', 'disclosing', 'information', 'strangers', 'believing', 'everything', 'hear', 'truth.My', 'only', 'quibble', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'up', 'one', 'troubled', 'relationship', 'others', 'hanging', 'clip', 'credits', 'reveals', 'life', 'regardless', 'lovers', 'just', 'rely', 'heartsThe', 'core', 'what', 'began', 'passionate', 'startAnd', 'may', 'not', 'want', 'endBut', 'will', 'just', 'question', 'when', 'Billy', 'Joel', 'Amanda', 'Richards', 'August', '1', '2011']",Trust

For me, this movie was riveting, emotionally powerful and the acting was incredibly good.  The subject matter is difficult to watch.  But necessary to watch if you are a parent because it seems absolutely true to life in terms of what can happen to kids/teens on the internet and the forces that can drive apart a loving family.

1422780,A2HCS608K512VS,B004O8OLNQ,"Barbara Amell ""editor, Wingfold""","[0, 0]","This is a remarkably well-made movie, with Oscar-caliber performances by Clive Owen as an affluent Chicago advertising executive and Liana Liberato as his teenage daughter who is seduced by an online predator. The subject matter may make this sound like an exploitative film or undesirable viewing; but this is one of the most valuable movies ever made about the effects of victimization, in large part because of the counseling scenes. Viola Davis plays the therapist, who attempts to guide a young girl away from the denial and confusion of seduction to acknowledge the painful reality that she was abused. There is not one false note among the actors, and many will be surprised that David Schwimmer, best known for his TV comedies, was the director of this masterful ensemble. In the DVD extras Davis credits Schwimmer with understanding an actor's process, and the evidence of this is abundantly clear on screen. Liberato needed to carry a large portion of this film at a young age, and she is simply astonishing in a role that any adult actor would have found daunting. Owen gives the finest performance of his career, and he should have been amply recognized for it in the 2010 awards season. Many people will shy away from this movie; but they should not: anyone who has ever felt victimized or felt helpless over a loved one's victimization will benefit from seeing this film.",5,Exceptional film,1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,1385,"['remarkably', 'well-made', 'movie', 'Oscar-caliber', 'performances', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'affluent', 'Chicago', 'advertising', 'executive', 'Liana', 'Liberato', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'who', 'seduced', 'online', 'predator', 'subject', 'matter', 'may', 'make', 'sound', 'exploitative', 'film', 'undesirable', 'viewing', 'one', 'most', 'valuable', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'effects', 'victimization', 'large', 'part', 'counseling', 'scenes', 'Viola', 'Davis', 'therapist', 'who', 'guide', 'young', 'girl', 'away', 'denial', 'confusion', 'seduction', 'acknowledge', 'painful', 'reality', 'was', 'abused', 'not', 'one', 'false', 'note', 'actors', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'surprised', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'best', 'known', 'TV', 'comedies', 'was', 'director', 'masterful', 'ensemble', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Davis', 'credits', 'Schwimmer', 'understanding', 'actor', 'process', 'evidence', 'abundantly', 'clear', 'screen', 'Liberato', 'needed', 'carry', 'large', 'portion', 'film', 'young', 'age', 'simply', 'astonishing', 'role', 'adult', 'actor', 'would', 'have', 'found', 'daunting', 'Owen', 'finest', 'performance', 'career', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'amply', 'recognized', '2010', 'awards', 'season', 'Many', 'people', 'will', 'shy', 'away', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'felt', 'victimized', 'felt', 'helpless', 'loved', 'one', 'victimization', 'will', 'benefit', 'seeing', 'film']",Trust

The performances are absolutely remarkable and vivid.One thing that was very shocking and real for me was the exquisiteness and accuracy of the details in the movie.  If you have experienced a situation similar or have been in contact with persons who have suffered this kind of abuse, you know that they remember vividly every detail of the abuser, and it was very clear in the movie, sometimes it is kind of raw, but sadly this is the reality.This film is a must see for every parent, I would send a copy of this to every school and church, it's not about raising panic, but awareness, as parents we have to know who the teachers of our children are, because you never know.

Although I adore high tech, I am really glad I did not have my own smartphone when I was a high schooler or college student. The daughter in this film has her own smartphone, computer and other electronic devices.  She is on her smartphone all of the time texting ""Charlie"", a guy she believes is a teenager, like herself.  Her parents do not find this at all strange that she texts him night and day and is building a bubble around herself of living in text messages.This movie takes the more obvious plot twist by making Charlie not what he seems to be in all of this messaging.  I am sure this happens but it is probably a smaller percentage the number of kids criminally victimized by this practice. I would have preferred if we could have stuck to the more everyday problems of living in a bubble world of text messaging, where the kid starts having trouble dealing with the daily world around herself and especially the fact that she probably doesn't have enough hours in the day.  The pressure of not having enough time to do all the messaging and live your life would really become excruciating in a very short while.I also would have liked some exposition of why the parents had absolutely no controls over her use of her gadgetry and/or the boys in her life, no matter which way the boys were attempting to enter her life.

I will be coming back and reviewing the Blu Ray quality once it is released so do not worry! Now for the Movie....This movie is about a young girl who is the victim of an internet predator, I seriously do not want to give anything about this movie out it hits HARD. The acting on both Clive Owens part and Liana Liberato are amazing. At times I wanted to cry for her and at others I could not even watch, Clive Owen brings so much realism to his role as a father it really got to me being a father and all I recommend this movie to any parent and teenager.Child Predators come in all forms and I really think this movie could help parents recognize things going on around them. Teenagers could also learn from this movie, It is a serious problem and the movie did such a well job showing so.EDITSo I have watched the Blu Ray release now and Must say it is not what I was expecting, Do not get me wrong it was great just not as good as most modern blu ray releases.

On the other hand most anyone, not living in a cave, is aware of the subject matter to the point this might not offer much new.Here's the scoop. A young girl is prayed upon by an on-line predator. She agrees to meet him only to find out he's much older than he said. Bad stuff happens and everybody tries to cope and get their lives back on track.On the good side. This is a well written, well acted and well directed piece. The script takes a nice turn in its approach with the daughter (Annie). Her response to what happened is not what the viewer might expect. This really helps things along, because it makes it so the story isn't just a hunt for the perp. It's about how the family tries to work through everything. They do insert the FBI investigation at regular intervals so the viewer gets a decent taste of how the authorities deal with all this. The problem is that the story concerns a very hot topic. It's something that is often in the news as well as on news based programs.

1422794,A2WHP314I6KDIP,B004O8OLNQ,"G. Jordan ""Voracious Reader""","[5, 7]","I've read the others' reviews 1st, to avoid redundancy. The message of this movie, which many seem to be missing the point, is that communication, openness & familial support are necessary and watching this movie WITH your children of any age where comprehension is possible, starting a dialogue and remaining open & honest, may help one avoid or prevent this event from happening in your family, or if it doesn't, may help you deal with the fallout. Adults reviewing say it is difficult watching, especially with their child/ren, I say be emotionally honest WHILE watching, say ""this hurts me to watch & imagine you in that situation"", ask ""do you know anyone this has happened to"", ask ""has anyone approached you this way & what did you do"". Be open & non-judgmental in accepting their honest answers, be willing & able to openly discuss these issues so that your child knows they can rely on you, TRUST YOU, knows they can bring you their questions & experiences in safety & love. In the special features, this is the hope of the makers of this movie, that an open dialogue can be started & to help others recognize the signs to watch out for.I especially appreciated the family's experience, the father's inability to deal with his daughter's sexuality &/or sexual identity, the reality of his emotions & fears, his rage & helplessness. The mother's frustration and different coping style, the difference in approach to coping between the parents and other family members. Everything about this movie is REAL, credible, believable, factual, every piece of dialogue is natural, the acting & directing as well as production quality could not be any better than in this movie. Entertaining as well as educational, emotional and physical reactions are expected and hoped for, a response is guaranteed in every viewer regardless of age, experience, opinion, belief, or family dynamics. This film has less violence, gore, thrills or chills than most cable TV or soap opera episodes, the most difficult scenes are the father's imaginings of what his daughter went through or of his murderous rage fantasies of killing the predator (or any sex offender he can find), as well as the initial scene in the motel room which is G-rated except for the torment Annie displays. Especially appreciated is the inclusion and depiction of how a victim reacts at the time of the incident, showing Annie disassociating from the activity, staring at something else to take herself out of the terrified body & mind being tormented, as a self-defense mechanism nearly all victims experience in order to survive.Annie's confusion, defiance & even defense of the man, is accurate & honest, something many viewers will find shocking and incredible, until you understand the level of maturity and doubt any teen faces while honing their personality, character, identity. There are many films a hundred times worse to watch than this one, which has a PG rating, covering similar perspectives. What makes this movie different is the emotional context, the underlying truths that are not in your face as some films that use shock value might portray. An objective story is told with no assumptions, nothing forced or stiff in delivering the realities every family faces these days, in different ways than past generations. What should result from viewing this movie is genuine family intimacy in opening the subject for honest conversations. Riveting in style & content, the issues addressed here are happening every second of every day--it's about time we started paying attention & changing what we can.Technically, the digital copy of the movie is approx. 829 MB, on same disc as movie, placed into DVD drive on a computer, in MPG-4 format.

1422795,A328S9RN3U5M68,B004O8OLNQ,Grady Harp,"[5, 7]","TRUST is a powerhouse of a film based on a personal story of a family's coping with a mad world.  Every character in this film exemplifies a form a trust - won or broken, earned or abused - and that is another reason that aside from the social commentary  of the abuses of our Internet dominated lives that everyone should see this movie. The searing script was written by Robert Festinger (of 'In the Bedroom' fame) and Andy Bellin and is the feature film directing debut of actor David Schwimmer: if this film is any indication of the understated power of Schwimmer's directorial eye then he should have a long career ahead.TRUST focuses on a suburban family, rich in tradition and very closely knit, who seem to be the prototypical happy American family.  The film opens with a birthday dinner for Annie (Liana Liberato) who is successful in sports and school but feels a need to belong to the 'in group' of peers, a strange kink in an otherwise emotionally mature teenager. She is obviously loved and supported by her successful father Will (Clive Owen) who gifts her with a laptop computer, her mother Lynn (Catherine Keener) who adapts well to the daily changes of growing up youngsters, her older brother (about to leave for college) Peter (Spencer Cornutt) and her little sister Katie (Aislinn DeButch). All progresses well until Annie meets a boyfriend Charlie (Chris Henry Coffey) on line.  After a few months of chatting, texting, phoning, and sharing photographs, Annie is in love - and then Charlie begins to lie about his age and his initial images as a high school jock (Tristan Peach) change to a college student, then a grad student - lies that Annie continues to accept and cope with until Charlie promises to fly to see her: in a mall meeting Charlie is actually 35 years old, brings Annie a gift of undergarments, and convinces Annie to go to a hotel room where Charlie claims 'love knows no age boundaries' and the relationship is consummated.The remainder of the film deals with how Annie's family deals with the discovery of Annie's physical interaction with Charlie.  The police are brought in and an investigation is headed by Detective Doug Tate (Jason Clark) while individual therapy is provided by the gifted Gail Friedman (Viola Davis).  The events lead to Annie's being informed that Charlie is a predator and a pedophile, the reaction of Will to the lack of speed in the investigation, and the stable force of Lynn.  How the brutal outside incision made on this family heals is the major emotional impact of the film.Each of the actors involved offer exceptionally finessed performances: we would expect that from Clive Owen, Catherine Keener, Viola  Davis, and Jason Clark, but the role of Annie is very strongly portrayed by newcomer Liana Liberato.  This films powerful message is one that should be required viewing by students and families around the world. It strongly suggests the dangers of Internet dating and the possible connection to pedophiles.

This movie -- TRUST -- scared the living daylights out of me because I have a pre-teen niece and I know that she's online and does texting and everything.  I remember when I was in college and chat rooms were just starting to get big and a friend of mine a few years after that got stalked online by a nut she met in a chat somewhere.  In the years since, everything's gotten so much more dangerous.  The Internet can be a really scary place, and kids who've grown up always having the online world are in danger and many of us don't ever realize it.In addition to this movie being a wakeup call as to what Internet predators are up to these days, it's also something of a mystery/thriller (but don't expect it to be fast-paced like a typical Hollywood movie).  If you like Law & Order:SVU you will like this...only it doesn't tie everything up as neatly as L&O; does and it is much more sedate.  This is a movie about an online predator who is smart and has been doing this for a while, what the FBI does to catch these people, and how these predators harm families.The first hour or so of this is just riveting...and it's the part that parents need to pay attention to because it is terrifying the kind of danger kids can get into online and by using cell phones.The last twenty minutes get a little slow as the movie runs out of steam a little bit. David Schwimmer from FRIENDS directed this, and maybe a better hand could have done something with this third act.  He clearly wanted the movie to be different, and to not tie things up neatly, but I think it kind of fell apart a little bit.  I was certainly waiting for that GOTCHA! moment where somehow the family finds a clue that sets things into a thriller/action/courtroom drama finale.

I'll try not to give away any details about that because it would be a MAJOR spoiler....and even if you think you know how things will turn out, I'm guessing you'll be surprised when the film ends.That's when you'll decide you wish you hadn't seen the movie - or you'll be glad it was so honest and believable.  It just isn't a ""typical""  or ""pat"" ending. I was glad of that, glad that viewers were trusted to understand why the film ended as it did.Okay, on to the movie - which focuses on a young woman who is so caught up in texting and calling her friends (as well as strangers she meets online) that her parents have to keep reminding her to pull back, to stop texting at dinner, etc (sound familiar to anyone out there?).Before long, the teen makes a new friend who isn't who he seems. And that's where I'll stop with the plot line...because it really wouldn't be fair to disclose more. But I will note that (just as with the ending), this isn't seen by the teen or her ""friend"" as a simple case of right and wrong - at least not at first.  It is the adults who see things in a clearer light.The fine points of the film include a portrayal of complicated family dynamics, a teen yearning for acceptance and romance, and fine performances by all the actors. One of the more unique aspects is how texts are used in place of actual dialogue. This isn't new to film but I find it unique because it is done believably, not always the case when used in other films.Okay, back to the ending. I found it very, very believable...and also food for thought for those of us who have dealt with the dilemma of kids and internet dangers. Not graphic, not violent but still could be extremely distressing for some.

The film deals with rape and it's a subject close to Schwimmer's heart. He's on the board of directors of the Rape Foundation for the Rape Treatment Center of Santa Monica. His passion for the subject shows in the sympathetic way he handles some potentially awkward scenes.The story focuses on a 14-year-old girl named Annie (Liberato). She's a typical teen on the surface, worrying about how she is perceived at school and hoping to be popular. Like most children in today's world, she spends a lot of time on the Internet and using her phone. We are frequently shown her text messages on the screen and the replies she gets. Her closest online friend is Charlie, who claims to be two years older than her. He gives her good advice and she trusts him.As the story progresses, Charlie reveals that he's 20 years old; then he amends that to 25. When he shows up without warning to meet her in the mall, she can see that he's closer to 40 than 25. Although she's initially dismayed, Charlie manages to gain her confidence. She gets in his car and the pair end up in a hotel room. The inevitable sexual encounter follows.When Annie tells her friend what happened, her friend feels compelled to tell the school principal the story. The police and FBI are called in and investigate the sexual assault. Annie doesn't see it that way and thinks that she's in love with Charlie and that he understands her. Annie's parents, Will (Owen) and Lynn (Keener), are shocked that their daughter has been raped by a sexual predator. Will starts doing some research of his own and finds out that several sexual offenders live close to his family and he's appalled.The film deals with the reactions of Annie's family and her friends at school. The situation is affecting her relationships with everyone and tearing her parents apart. Will is consumed by the knowledge and it affects his marriage, work, and his relationship with Annie. Clive Owen is at his best and shows that he has considerable range. Keener is always good and she's also convincing.Annie's character is the most important role and Liberato pulls it off superbly. She shows her vulnerability and innocence, but also her determination, and she's convinced that she knows better than those trying to protect her. We see her in therapy with Gail (Davis), and the two are utterly convincing. Schwimmer has assembled a cast that is more than up to the task of handling the controversial subject matter.I have gone into a lot of detail, but I'm leaving a lot of things out as I don't want to reveal all of the film's secrets.This isn't a typical Hollywood story where everything is wrapped up neatly. The issues are real and some characters and relationships suffer permanent damage. What matters is that this story is told. The Internet is a wonderful resource, but there will always be those who seek to use it to exploit other people. Hopefully, some parents and teens will see the film and increase their awareness of potential dangers.When I watch Trust, I'm reminded of Stanley Kubrick's Lolita. The two films were shot fifty years apart and the world is a very different place today, but there are similarities. An Education also deals with similar issues and was set in the same time period as Lolita, but Trust provides a timely update in a world in which technology has advanced dramatically.Put yourself in Will's position and think about what you would do. Trust is a gripping emotional drama with an important message. I found myself captured by the story after a few minutes and I couldn't look away from the screen. Fans of emotional dramas set in the real world will probably appreciate Schwimmer's thought-provoking cautionary tale.Video Quality 3.5/5Trust looks a little disappointing on Blu-ray. The colors appear accurate and the image is clean and bright, but detail isn't up to the standard expected of a modern release. Facial details are lacking and the entire image looks soft for most of the running time. It's not exactly bad, and likely won't be distracting, but there's certainly room for improvement.Audio Quality 4/5Trust is a story that's driven by dialogue and it comes across clearly. The English TrueHD 5.1 mix delivers a competent track that is suitable for the mood of the film.Special Features 2/5The additional features appear in HD.The Story of Trust (16:44) - The cast and crew talk about the film.Interviews with Cast and Crew (13:43) - Repeats much of what was said in the opening feature.Behind the Scenes (3:19) - Showing a few scenes being filmed.Trust does a lot of things well. Schwimmer makes some good choices and draws good performances from the excellent cast. The pacing feels right and the importance of the story gives the film additional weight. Liberato's performance is well worth seeing and seems incredibly real. Fans of Clive Owen's action roles might not enjoy this as it's a totally different type of film. If you like emotional drama, Trust is worth your time. The Blu-ray presentation is a little disappointing, but doesn't detract from the story.At the time of writing, Amazon.com's price is just $13.99.Overall score 4/5",4,An important story and one of the

She thinks he ""loves"" her, she makes excuses, etc. (that may have been the toughest part to watch). Dad loses his mind, pretty much, because he's so upset over the whole thing, and he seems to put his foot wrong in everything. The penultimate scene, where he tells his daughter how sorry he is for not protecting her, literally made my eyes well up (and I don't cry easily).

1422827,A2W3HLHIA9UP4D,B004O8OLNQ,The Piper at the Gates,"[3, 4]","My expectations of this film was fairly high, since the basic story sounded intriguing. The story is about a teenage girl who gets lured in and taken advantage of by a sexual predator. And it shows the aftermath on what it does to the victim's family. And while the first half of the film was decent, the second half and end result of this film left me wanting a lot more. And quite frankly, pretty bored as well. Perhaps this is a more realistic look at what families deal with when coping with victims of sexual predators, but as a movie, it was left incomplete. I felt that there was so many different ways the movie could have went that would made it so much more interesting and entertaining as a film. But instead, it doesn't really go anywhere. There's no real action taken or no real conflict resolution. After the point in the film where the teenage daughter is raped, I think the viewer is expecting that to build up into a number of other plot points. One major gripe I have is that the movie teases you into thinking something is going to eventually happen. Is the father going to track down the guy himself and kill the offender or bring him to justice? Well it seems like that's where the film was going, but it never does. I kept waiting for something along those lines to happen..perhaps the FBI catches the guy? Maybe he comes back to try to kill the victim and the family? But no, none of these things ever develop. The film didn't even have enough guts to kill the victim off when she attempted suicide near the end of the film. Any of these events would have made the film a lot more interesting, and you would have at least seen some sort of satisfying ending. Instead, its scene after scene of the family members trying to deal with the event. I understand that those scenes are needed to further connect with the characters, but you need plot development in a film, not just character development. There's a few scenes where you feel that the father (Clive Owen), is going over the edge, but as I said, nothing develops from it. Again, I understand that this is probably depicts a more realistic view on a situation like this, but this is a movie, not a documentary. There is still an element of entertainment and interest that should be reached, no matter how serious the content may be for some viewers. I understand that there's probably a lot of parents out there that attach themselves to this film a bit more, simply because its more easier for them to relate to it, and that's great. But for me, I was expecting a better film than this. I'm not saying the film is bad, in a sense of acting or film-making. And the basic premise of the film is really good. But I just feel it doesn't do much of anything after the main conflict/event in the story occurs.",3,"2.75 Stars: Had Potential, but Ultimately It Was Pretty Uneventful",1340928000,"06 29, 2012",2012,2783,"['expectations', 'film', 'was', 'fairly', 'high', 'basic', 'story', 'sounded', 'intriguing', 'story', 'teenage', 'girl', 'who', 'lured', 'taken', 'advantage', 'sexual', 'predator', 'aftermath', 'what', 'victim', 'family', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'second', 'half', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'left', 'wanting', 'lot', 'more', 'quite', 'frankly', 'pretty', 'bored', 'as', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'more', 'realistic', 'look', 'what', 'families', 'deal', 'when', 'coping', 'victims', 'sexual', 'predators', 'movie', 'was', 'left', 'incomplete', 'felt', 'was', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'ways', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'went', 'would', 'made', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'entertaining', 'film', 'instead', ""n't"", 'really', 'go', 'anywhere', 'real', 'action', 'taken', 'real', 'conflict', 'resolution', 'point', 'film', 'where', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'raped', 'think', 'viewer', 'expecting', 'build', 'up', 'number', 'other', 'plot', 'points', 'One', 'major', 'gripe', 'have', 'movie', 'thinking', 'something', 'going', 'eventually', 'happen', 'father', 'going', 'track', 'down', 'guy', 'kill', 'offender', 'bring', 'justice', 'Well', 'where', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'never', 'kept', 'waiting', 'something', 'lines', 'happen..perhaps', 'FBI', 'guy', 'Maybe', 'back', 'try', 'kill', 'victim', 'family', 'none', 'things', 'ever', 'develop', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'enough', 'guts', 'kill', 'victim', 'off', 'when', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'end', 'film', 'events', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'film', 'lot', 'more', 'interesting', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'seen', 'sort', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Instead', 'scene', 'scene', 'family', 'members', 'trying', 'deal', 'event', 'understand', 'scenes', 'are', 'needed', 'further', 'connect', 'characters', 'need', 'plot', 'development', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'character', 'development', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'feel', 'father', 'Clive', 'Owen', 'going', 'edge', 'said', 'nothing', 'Again', 'understand', 'probably', 'more', 'realistic', 'view', 'situation', 'movie', 'not', 'documentary', 'still', 'element', 'entertainment', 'interest', 'should', 'be', 'reached', 'matter', 'how', 'serious', 'content', 'may', 'be', 'viewers', 'understand', 'probably', 'lot', 'parents', 'there', 'attach', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'simply', 'more', 'easier', 'relate', 'great', 'was', 'expecting', 'better', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'bad', 'sense', 'acting', 'film-making', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'really', 'good', 'just', 'feel', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'anything', 'main', 'conflict/event', 'story']",Trust

The only thing we can do is we can be there for each other when we fall down to pick each other up.""  After months and months of chatting on an internet room Annie decides to meet ""Charlie"".  When she discovers he is not who he says he is her life and the life of her family is changed forever.  This is a movie that needs to be seen by everyone, especially those with kids.  The movie will stick with you long after its over, as it should.  This movie is very disturbing on so many levels, the most disturbing being the scene during the end credits.  Everyone that watches this will be able to relate to at least one character.  This is the most realistic account of this problem that I have ever seen, and may help you to recognize the signs.  Once again this is a blaring example of how a movie without effects and explosions are not promoted like they should be because of the lack of earning potential, due to the serious subject matter.  When a movie like this only makes $100,000 while a movie like ""Arthur"" makes $33,000,000 there is a serious problem.  The fact that Hollywood would rather promote an unnecessary remake starring Russel Brand then a movie that could actually help someone is awful and whoever is in charge of this needs to take a look at what they are doing.  That's the end of my rant...sorry about that.  Overall, a powerful and important movie.  Please please please watch this movie.  I give it an A+.Would I watch again? - I don't know if I could make it through again, but I would if it meant that someone would watch it who other wise wouldn't*Also try - In Her Skin & Lovely Bones",5,"An extremely important movie that begs to be watched.

Or not giving them a computer at all, and there are ways to monitor what goes on in the cyber world. You can't really protect and shelter them from the world even though we'd like to. The movie does touch base very well on the concept behind sexual predators online. But it really seems to lack capturing the real feel and emotional damage that it does. Clive Owen is a great actor, but this role seems all wrong for him, as it does with the young girl Annie. It's just very slow paced(to slow pace) about a subject that is very serious. Also the girl seems to actually be in favor of protecting the man who assaulted her in the fist place. In a way it kind of portrays teenage girls as being stupid and naive. I imagine that most kids today if confronted with an older man that they meet offline, they would say omg, you sick pervert etc. That's one of the reasons the movie just doesnt go anywhere. I was expecting more of a stalker situation, who wouldn't leave the girl alone, but instead you get a slow paced bunch of talk, and very little tension. So while Trust isn't horrible, is certainly doesnt break any new ground, and will become a Lifetime Special at best.
