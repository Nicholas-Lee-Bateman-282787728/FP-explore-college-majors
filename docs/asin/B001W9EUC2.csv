After watching Ipman, I think I will give it another lease.Set in 1930's China, Ipman is about the life of the Wing Chun master (Donnie Yen) who is only known to us because of his famous pupil Bruce Lee but let me tell you the teachers life was no less exciting. Ipman is a wealthy but kind and a generous man and one of the best martial art experts in his town. The invading Japanese army reduces the town to rubble and confiscates his house. He is forced to work in the mines. The commanding Japanese general is a martial art lover but also a pervert. He invites mine workers to come and fight him or his troops in return for a bag of rice. An incident happens and Ipman with great reluctance has to defend himself by fighting the general.Ipman is a great film and along with the fights which are awesome there is a storyline. Some portions are silly in the script such as the uprising of the factory workers against the bandits but I have seen many Asian films and such story props are commonplace.

The moves are amazing and shot with a wonderful camera style that enhances the action instead of obfuscating it with too many cuts or confusing angles.

My review has to do with the entertainment value of the film only.There's probably not a great need for another positive review of 'Ip Man', other than the opportunity to pile on the recommendations.  Still, there are a couple of points one might want to consider when deciding whether to take a chance on it or not.First, if you are already a fan of martial art films, then this is an excellent choice.  While I don't watch a ton of them, I was very impressed with the action sequences here, coupled with the production quality.  Like many movies of this type, there is not a tremendous amount of depth to the story - down and out good guy vs. a bad guy who has all the odds in his favor, yet the good guy wins out.  That's it in a nutshell, which is the formula for a lot of genre pictures, whether martial arts or American westerns.  But if you don't demand that every film you watch plumb the depths of the human condition, and are looking for a simple action film, then this one does it extremely well.Ip Man was a genuine historical figure, and his particular variation of Kung Fu was called Wing Chun - and among his students was a young Bruce Lee.  This made me wonder how much of the rest of this story was true-to-life, though the only help that Wikipedia gives is that ""the film takes a number of liberties with Yip's life, often for dramatic effect"".  Now you know as much as I do - probably best to take most of the sequences as the process of mythologizing a folk hero.  Not that there's anything wrong with that!One last note: The service I streamed this rental from had the original Cantonese and Japanese audio.  From a few of the other reviewers, it seems as if Amazon only offers this in a dubbed version.  Depending on how important the audio is to you may make Amazon's version best, or not.

1244420,A3DCNC90MS4HVE,B001W9EUC2,cxlxmx,"[3, 5]","I watched this with my family, who aren't actually interested in martial arts, and they thought it was great.  I also enjoyed it, as I would enjoy almost any kung fu film, but I didn't think it was great, either for its martial arts or its plot elements.My family, especially my mother, was drawn in by the presentation of Ip's interactions with his family at the beginning of the film.  For people who don't know kung fu films and have gotten used to the western anti-heroes, seeing a hero portrayed as a gentlemanly family man is a thrilling experience.  They then found the fighting exciting.  When they found out Ip Man was a real person, they were beside themselves.As for myself, I found this to be a very watchable but tame kung fu film.  It's too ahistorical to be considered an actual biographical portrayal of Ip Man's life, it's too PC vis-a-vis WWII to be dramatically compelling, and the fighting falls in a grey area where it has too much special effect to leave the impression of watching real fighting and not enough special effect to give the pleasure of fantasy fighting.  Although I enjoyed the beginning of the movie as did my family, I found the Japanese tournaments and their resolutions cliche and slightly boring.The main thing this film has going for it are sympathetic characters and quite good acting for the depth of the script.  The sets, costuming, filmography, etc are also well done.  On the down side, the stench of nationalist sentiment hangs about this movie, as it does so much of the entertainment coming out of China today.

1244427,A3IL3LL7F06GCF,B001W9EUC2,Demon_Mustang,"[61, 80]","OK, I was originally going to give this a much lower star rating, but didn't want people to mistaken it as a negative review of the film itself, because it isn't, the film is a GREAT martial arts film. My low rating is the DVD itself. First thing I noticed is that the subtitles neglected to subtitle the words in the beginning credits. Now I'm not talking about the names, I'm talking about the first paragraph after the names right after you see him practicing Wing Chun, which tells the audience about the city and how it's known for being the origin of China's Nan Tian style of martial arts. And for that reason, it attracts martial artists from all over China to establish dojos and to exchange martial arts culture. It goes on to say that today Fuoshan (the town in the film where Ip Man is from) have become known as ""THE TOWN"" of martial arts. If you can't read Chinese, you won't know what that entire paragraph reads, and that's stupid because it's kind of important to the story.The second thing I noticed is how poor the quality was. It's not so bad that it's unwatchable, but it's FAR worse than most DVD's I've owned.Then the thing that made me stop watching this was the audio. For some reason they decided they didn't like the original audio stream and replaced it. But the first thing you'll notice is the volume. It's EXTREMELY low, you'll have to crank your system all the way up if you are to hear anything.Then the next thing you'll notice is the bad syncing of the lips and of the fighting sound effects. The reason for this isn't apparent to those who don't know Chinese. But I do, I understand some Cantonese, which is a dialect of Chinese spoken most commonly by the ""common"" people, mainly from Canton. That is the language most of the people speak in this movie, except the Japs of course and those fighters from the North who spoke Mandarin. However, this is the reason why they redid the entire audio stream including the sound effects. They changed the audio from Cantonese to all Mandarin. I don't know why, perhaps this version was printed in China and they consider Mandarin the ""official"" dialect and kind of look down on Cantonese, Hakka, and other Chinese dialects.To those who don't know the difference, this sucks because now the audio is too soft and the syncing is bad (you see a hit, then hear it, or vice versa) and they neglected to add back in some of the little verbal gestures Chinese people are known to make (like going ""mmm"" instead of actually saying yes, they did this in the original movie, but they omitted a lot of it in this print, instead, it's just silence).But to those who understand Chinese, it also sucks because it takes the authenticity away since the film's locale's native language is Cantonese, so in real life, they would have been speaking Cantonese, not Mandarin, and people know this. That's why they had the inhabitants of this city speaking Cantonese and the fighters from the North that came down to challenge them spoke Mandarin. That is how it was and that is how they wanted to portray it. Now everyone spoke Mandarin and it's pretty annoying.Either that or the Cantonese audio stream is so jarbled that I don't understand it. All I know is that when I first watched this movie, I understood almost all of it since I know Cantonese. When I bought this DVD, I couldn't understand any of it and had to use the subtitles... Not to mention I could barely hear it.I don't know, the movie is a great movie, it is kind of like Fearless, but a little more historically accurate, Fearless was VERY inaccurate in terms of historical accuracy, this was a bit better, but the fighting is very different because this is Wing Chun, which is purely a close range fighting technique, which is where almost all fights end up anyhow so it's also the most practical of all martial arts in my opinion. You will almost NEVER get into a street fight where your opponent will stay a leg's length away from you so you can do Tae Kwon Do style kicks at them. That is completely unrealistic and exclusive to competition style fighting. In real fights, your opponent will tend to want to close the distance any chance he gets. So Wing Chun which focuses on close in, short arm fighting is perfect for that.I suggest you watch this film, but I really would like to find a better print than this one, I know it exists because I've seen it not too long ago, a friend had it, but he doesn't have the box or anything and doesn't know what version it is.",3,"DVD 1.5 stars, movie 5 stars",1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,4498,"['OK', 'was', 'originally', 'going', 'give', 'much', 'lower', 'star', 'rating', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'people', 'mistaken', 'negative', 'review', 'film', ""n't"", 'film', 'GREAT', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'low', 'rating', 'DVD', 'First', 'thing', 'noticed', 'subtitles', 'neglected', 'subtitle', 'words', 'beginning', 'credits', 'Now', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'names', ""'m"", 'talking', 'first', 'paragraph', 'names', 'right', 'see', 'practicing', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'audience', 'city', 'how', 'known', 'being', 'origin', 'China', 'Nan', 'Tian', 'style', 'martial', 'arts', 'reason', 'martial', 'artists', 'China', 'establish', 'dojos', 'exchange', 'martial', 'arts', 'culture', 'say', 'today', 'Fuoshan', 'town', 'film', 'where', 'Ip', 'Man', 'have', 'become', 'known', 'TOWN', 'martial', 'arts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'read', 'Chinese', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'entire', 'paragraph', 'reads', 'stupid', 'kind', 'important', 'story.The', 'second', 'thing', 'noticed', 'how', 'poor', 'quality', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'bad', 'unwatchable', 'FAR', 'worse', 'most', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'thing', 'made', 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'audio', 'reason', 'decided', 'did', ""n't"", 'original', 'audio', 'stream', 'replaced', 'first', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'volume', 'EXTREMELY', 'low', ""'ll"", 'have', 'crank', 'system', 'way', 'up', 'are', 'hear', 'next', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'notice', 'bad', 'syncing', 'lips', 'fighting', 'sound', 'effects', 'reason', ""n't"", 'apparent', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Chinese', 'do', 'understand', 'Cantonese', 'dialect', 'Chinese', 'spoken', 'most', 'commonly', 'common', 'people', 'mainly', 'Canton', 'language', 'most', 'people', 'speak', 'movie', 'Japs', 'course', 'fighters', 'North', 'who', 'spoke', 'Mandarin', 'However', 'reason', 'why', 'redid', 'entire', 'audio', 'stream', 'including', 'sound', 'effects', 'changed', 'audio', 'Cantonese', 'Mandarin', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'perhaps', 'version', 'was', 'printed', 'China', 'consider', 'Mandarin', 'official', 'dialect', 'kind', 'look', 'down', 'Cantonese', 'Hakka', 'other', 'Chinese', 'dialects.To', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'difference', 'sucks', 'because', 'now', 'audio', 'too', 'soft', 'syncing', 'bad', 'see', 'hit', 'then', 'hear', 'vice', 'versa', 'neglected', 'add', 'back', 'little', 'verbal', 'gestures', 'Chinese', 'people', 'are', 'known', 'make', 'going', 'mmm', 'instead', 'actually', 'saying', 'yes', 'did', 'original', 'movie', 'omitted', 'lot', 'print', 'instead', 'just', 'silence', '.But', 'who', 'understand', 'Chinese', 'also', 'authenticity', 'away', 'film', 'locale', 'native', 'language', 'Cantonese', 'so', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'speaking', 'Cantonese', 'not', 'Mandarin', 'people', 'know', 'why', 'had', 'inhabitants', 'city', 'speaking', 'Cantonese', 'fighters', 'North', 'came', 'down', 'challenge', 'spoke', 'Mandarin', 'how', 'was', 'how', 'wanted', 'portray', 'Now', 'everyone', 'spoke', 'Mandarin', 'pretty', 'annoying.Either', 'Cantonese', 'audio', 'stream', 'so', 'jarbled', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'know', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'movie', 'understood', 'almost', 'know', 'Cantonese', 'When', 'bought', 'DVD', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'had', 'use', 'subtitles', 'Not', 'mention', 'could', 'barely', 'hear', 'it.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'movie', 'great', 'movie', 'kind', 'like', 'Fearless', 'little', 'more', 'historically', 'accurate', 'Fearless', 'was', 'VERY', 'inaccurate', 'terms', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'was', 'bit', 'better', 'fighting', 'very', 'different', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'purely', 'close', 'range', 'fighting', 'technique', 'where', 'almost', 'fights', 'end', 'up', 'anyhow', 'also', 'most', 'practical', 'martial', 'arts', 'opinion', 'will', 'almost', 'NEVER', 'get', 'street', 'fight', 'where', 'opponent', 'will', 'stay', 'leg', 'length', 'away', 'can', 'do', 'Tae', 'Kwon', 'Do', 'style', 'kicks', 'completely', 'unrealistic', 'exclusive', 'competition', 'style', 'fighting', 'real', 'fights', 'opponent', 'will', 'tend', 'want', 'close', 'distance', 'chance', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'close', 'short', 'arm', 'fighting', 'perfect', 'that.I', 'suggest', 'watch', 'film', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'find', 'better', 'print', 'one', 'know', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'friend', 'had', ""n't"", 'have', 'box', 'anything', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'version']",N/A

You loose so much when the native language is dubbed over with voice actors no matter how well they perform. A great example, besides this movie, is the really awesomeCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon [Blu-ray]. I watched the subtitled version and I was riveted to the screen. Epic story and so gripping I was completely blown away. Then, I wanted to share that amazement with my brother, who is not much of a reader, and he had a hard time keeping up with the subtitles so we switched over to dubbed. God awful. I was so disappointed.Anyway, there is at least one single star review because of the dubbing so I am happy to give this 5 stars and let the other reviewer warn those concerned about why a great movie like this would get one star.Not all historical movies are made as well as this one. The fighting is first class and the acting is, I think, superb if you can forgive the dubbing. I do wonder if that is really what Master Ip was really like, not because Donnie Yen played him badly but because his mannerisms were unusual compared to every other character in the film(s).There are a lot of funny scenes in the movie. Considering part of the subject matter, the occupation of China by Japan, I found that to be a wonderful strength for the story. Japan was a cruel master of all occupied territories and this movie did a pretty good job of portraying that too. If anything, it was mild in that respect. They were merciless masters that starved their subjects to feed their war machine and their own people.Although not a non-stop action movie, the story is well told, interesting and will keep your attention if you aren't an adrenalin junkie.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 3]","This was a thrilling biopic, full of the genuine richness of a China we remember best from THE LAST EMPEROR--and about one of my favorite heroes, Master Ip Man, teacher of Bruce Lee. This covers a brief period, from the toddlerhood of Master Ip's son, Ip Chun, to the family's escape from the village of Fu Shan to Taipei. This covers the Japanese invasion of China.While I've had my fill of these ridiculous Chinese preach-fest films, yapping about freedom and cooperation in the face of a modern government that is corrupt, murderous and sick with communism, I enjoyed this film. The reason is because I know the Chinese filmmakers are making democratic statements here and there, when they can. Even though that happy fact doesn't stop actors like Jet Li from continuing to serve two masters, it sure made IP MAN a damn sight more fun to watch.Donnie Yen is at his strongest and most noble in this role; the last time I can recall seeing him was in IRON MONKEY and the movie WING CHUN (about the founding of the art of which Ip Man was a master). One thing that irritates the hell out of me is a good Chinese film ruined by the dorks whose voices are dubbed over the actors' voices. Do I want to hear native speech and look at subtitles? You bet! These guys never learn.Aside from some visible wires--unpardonable these days but still common in China--the action is top notch. Yen executes his moves with grace and poise that I rarely see in Chinese wu shu films. It helps that Master Ip's son, Master Ip Chun, choreographed this film and it is a tribute to him as well. Still, the action is never a substitute for a good storyline...and this film falls a bit flat because it deals with a few years of Master Ip's life. They were formative years for him, and we want to see more of his later years all the more for it. I felt a bit cheated by this movie, running at just over one hour forty minutes.It HAS to be seen, but I don't know if I'll ever add it to my collection. You see, I have memories and some excellent books to cover that part of my interior life. It was, I can assure you, so terrific to see this film once anyway.",4,"Chinese wu-su is the way of peace...after a few Japanese broken bones, that is",1280534400,"07 31, 2010",2010,2133,"['was', 'thrilling', 'biopic', 'full', 'genuine', 'richness', 'China', 'remember', 'best', 'LAST', 'EMPEROR', 'one', 'favorite', 'heroes', 'Master', 'Ip', 'Man', 'teacher', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'brief', 'period', 'toddlerhood', 'Master', 'Ip', 'son', 'Ip', 'Chun', 'family', 'escape', 'village', 'Fu', 'Shan', 'Taipei', 'Japanese', 'invasion', 'China.While', ""'ve"", 'had', 'fill', 'ridiculous', 'Chinese', 'preach-fest', 'films', 'yapping', 'freedom', 'cooperation', 'face', 'modern', 'government', 'corrupt', 'murderous', 'sick', 'communism', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'reason', 'know', 'Chinese', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'making', 'democratic', 'statements', 'here', 'there', 'when', 'can', 'Even', 'happy', 'fact', ""n't"", 'stop', 'actors', 'Jet', 'Li', 'continuing', 'serve', 'two', 'masters', 'sure', 'made', 'IP', 'MAN', 'damn', 'sight', 'more', 'fun', 'watch.Donnie', 'Yen', 'strongest', 'most', 'noble', 'role', 'last', 'time', 'can', 'recall', 'seeing', 'was', 'IRON', 'MONKEY', 'movie', 'WING', 'CHUN', 'founding', 'art', 'Ip', 'Man', 'was', 'master', 'One', 'thing', 'hell', 'good', 'Chinese', 'film', 'ruined', 'dorks', 'voices', 'are', 'dubbed', 'actors', 'voices', 'Do', 'want', 'hear', 'native', 'speech', 'look', 'subtitles', 'bet', 'guys', 'never', 'learn.Aside', 'visible', 'wires', 'unpardonable', 'days', 'still', 'common', 'China', 'action', 'top', 'notch', 'Yen', 'moves', 'grace', 'poise', 'rarely', 'see', 'Chinese', 'wu', 'shu', 'films', 'Master', 'Ip', 'son', 'Master', 'Ip', 'Chun', 'choreographed', 'film', 'tribute', 'as', 'well', 'Still', 'action', 'never', 'substitute', 'good', 'storyline', 'film', 'bit', 'flat', 'few', 'years', 'Master', 'Ip', 'life', 'were', 'formative', 'years', 'want', 'see', 'more', 'later', 'years', 'more', 'felt', 'bit', 'cheated', 'movie', 'running', 'just', 'one', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes.It', 'HAS', 'be', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'add', 'collection', 'see', 'have', 'memories', 'excellent', 'books', 'cover', 'part', 'interior', 'life', 'was', 'can', 'assure', 'so', 'terrific', 'see', 'film', 'once', 'anyway']",N/A

The past 10 years or so have seen a great maturing of the genre. The stars, directors, budgets have all risen to create a genuinely respectable category in film making. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Hero"" have not only been great Kung Fu movies, they've been great movies.""Ip Man"" is right up there with the best. The producers were smart in using an actual historical event on which to base their film. The first act sets up the characters. You get to meet Master Ip and see how he truly embodies the philosophies of Kung Fu. He's a genuinely decent dude. In the second act the Japanese invade China and society breaks down. Two thirds of the population split the scene and the last third scrap for whatever food and jobs they can get while dodging Japanese soldiers. Master Ip Takes on slave level labor as he tries to keep the household together. The head Japanese General wants his Kung Fu soldiers to take on the locals in Kung Fu matches where a sack of rice is the prize for the winner. The third act is Ip Man finally caving into the request that he fight the Japanese General. He does and, of course, kicks his butt. They then go on to a post script on how he went on to form other Kung Fu schools and gained a couple of million desciples.This is a good idea that works well. The sets and costuming look authentic and it is generally directed well. The sub-plots were decent enough and added depth to the proceedings, but the real joy here are the fight scenes. They are as well, if not better, choreographed and directed as any I've ever seen. The fights are spaced out nicely throughout the movie and they escalate in intensity. What is cool is the climactic fight between the two heavies isn't drawn out, Hollywood style, for too long.

1244446,A1GXBMUTVHWHJL,B001W9EUC2,Flash,"[1, 6]","IP Man is a better than average action flick. In formula, it reminds me of some of the better US action films. Oddly, it is in this way that IP Man differs from some of the other Chinese martial arts films I have enjoyed: The fact that it is very American in formula. The story is simple, enjoyable and actually quite entertaining. However, I must point out that the Chinese nationalism in this movie is so over-the-top in your face, it toys with certain historical truths and is comically degrading to people of Japanese descent. I don't know, but there must be a lot of residual hatred over there OR quite simply, maybe this is the history that is taught in China! One example that at first I chuckled over, but then as I continued to ponder it, found that my laughter had turned to shock, occurs at the very end of the movie. This is not a spoiler. Just before the final credits, the subtitle states that in August of 1945, the Japanese surrended unconditionally because the Chinese had won the eight year war. No mention of the United States' involvement in the Japanese surrender at the end of WWII at all! I guess we didn't exist! And if you happen to be Japanese (I am not), the insults are constant throughout this film.Nevertheless, IP Man is another beautiful film. The cinematography is crisp, it is colorful or drab to depict a mood, and it is constantly gorgeous. I really liked the main Character of the IP Man played by Donnie Chen.

HK and china are killing the genre with mediocre efforts that copy each other.  how many other Ip Man movies are now out?Ip Man suffers from many of the same cliches as all the other recent martial arts films coming out of China.  from the Chinese nationalism (and anti-Japanese fervor) to the same wirefu moves we've seen in countless other movies.  how many times do we need to see two men dueling on a platform and one nearly falls at the edge only to somehow wirefu back to safety?  it's in here... hm, sounds a lot like Fearless with Jet Li.of course, the Ip Man biography is... surprise, totally fabricated.  i guess that's ok because anyone who still thinks ""based on a true story"" is somehow true probably still believes in bigfoot and the tooth fairy.having said all that, this movie is still quite good.  forget the Ip Man baggage, the political overtones, the cliche story and you get a very nice performance by Donnie Yen as the stoic and reluctant master.  that's right, Donnie Yen's acting is alone worth the watch.  his acting is both nuanced from his care of his wife and expressive when his inner fury boils over watching his friend get shot.  (and let me also add that Lam Ka-tung performed admirably as the Police chief turned traitor.  his side story added a nice dimension to an otherwise typical one.)the martial arts choreography is restrained in the use of wirefu and yet, i wish it was even more so.  there is a gritty brutality to Ip Man when his anger and determination is fully realized.  and it was distracting to see some of the comical hanging in the air moves.  at least they didn't fight on poles for no apparent reason.this may sound like a negative review, but only because this movie was good enough for me to care and want it to have been better. there are enough, ""wow, that was very cool!"" moments in the movie that make it a worthwhile purchase and i give it a very solid 4 stars.",4,one of the better new martial arts films,1288310400,"10 29, 2010",2010,2011,"['let', 'face', 'are', 'age', 'where', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'banal', 'HK', 'china', 'are', 'killing', 'genre', 'mediocre', 'efforts', 'copy', 'other', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'Ip', 'Man', 'movies', 'are', 'now', 'Ip', 'Man', 'suffers', 'many', 'same', 'cliches', 'other', 'recent', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'coming', 'China', 'Chinese', 'nationalism', 'anti-Japanese', 'fervor', 'same', 'wirefu', 'moves', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'countless', 'other', 'movies', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'do', 'need', 'see', 'two', 'men', 'dueling', 'platform', 'one', 'nearly', 'edge', 'only', 'somehow', 'wirefu', 'back', 'safety', 'here', 'hm', 'lot', 'Fearless', 'Jet', 'Li.of', 'course', 'Ip', 'Man', 'biography', 'surprise', 'totally', 'fabricated', 'i', 'guess', 'ok', 'anyone', 'who', 'still', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'somehow', 'true', 'probably', 'still', 'bigfoot', 'tooth', 'fairy.having', 'said', 'movie', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'forget', 'Ip', 'Man', 'baggage', 'political', 'overtones', 'cliche', 'story', 'get', 'very', 'nice', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'stoic', 'reluctant', 'master', 'right', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'acting', 'alone', 'worth', 'watch', 'acting', 'nuanced', 'care', 'wife', 'expressive', 'when', 'inner', 'fury', 'boils', 'watching', 'friend', 'get', 'shot', 'let', 'also', 'add', 'Lam', 'Ka-tung', 'performed', 'admirably', 'Police', 'chief', 'turned', 'traitor', 'side', 'story', 'added', 'nice', 'dimension', 'otherwise', 'typical', 'one', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', 'restrained', 'use', 'wirefu', 'yet', 'i', 'wish', 'was', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'gritty', 'brutality', 'Ip', 'Man', 'when', 'anger', 'determination', 'fully', 'realized', 'was', 'distracting', 'see', 'comical', 'hanging', 'air', 'moves', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'fight', 'poles', 'apparent', 'reason.this', 'may', 'sound', 'negative', 'review', 'only', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'enough', 'care', 'want', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'are', 'enough', 'wow', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'moments', 'movie', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'purchase', 'i', 'give', 'very', 'solid', '4', 'stars']",N/A

1244456,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B001W9EUC2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[11, 13]","Really, damn! In the realm of martial arts cinema, it really doesn't get more compelling than this movie. IP MAN, riveting and strewn with electrifying martial arts sequences, propels Donnie Yen to that summit of Asian action cinema (scooch over, Tony Jaa). IP MAN tells the semi-biographical story of the grandmaster of Wing Chun and, later in life, mentor to Bruce Lee. IP MAN presents a historical human drama, set in the backdrop of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and the story draws you in, but I think this has more to do with Donnie Yen's powerhouse performance more than anything else. I agree with those who say that this is Donnie Yen's finest work.The harshness of the Japanese occupation will draw out hisses. It's hard not to sympathize with the populace of Foshan as lives become reduced to a state of poverty so abject that starving men volunteer to fight for the Japanese general's entertainment, all for a single sack of rice (should they win). Ip Man himself, widely regarded as the best martial artist in Foshan, finds his skills useless under Japanese rule and he struggles to support his family. Donnie Yen as Ip Man is grace under pressure, cultured and principled and self-deprecating (and, okay, maybe a bit detached). It takes a wanton act of brutality to turn him into an instrument of vengeance. And when Ip Man finally loses his cool... well, it sets the stage for a sequence of pure assownery. Donnie Yen's wing chun is dynamic and exciting, and he's so fluid in action. I have to say, at this point, that whoever came up with the wonderful score deserves a lot of credit. The score not only adds dramatic impact to the story but lends even more tension to the combat scenes. But you'll hear in the bonus features that even longtime practitioners of the wing chun discipline are raving about Donnie Yen's technique. It's surprising to learn that, before IP MAN, Donnie didn't know too much wing chun. He trained in it for the nine strenuous months leading up to the film's shooting.Donnie Yen gets a great supporting cast: lovely Lynn Hung (in her film debut) as Ip Man's long-suffering wife (she loves her husband, can't stand it when he fights), Simon Yam as the cotton mill's distinguished owner and Ip Man's friend, and Fan Siu-Wong as Jin Shanzhao, the scruffy, over-aggressive martial artist from the north who challenges - and annihilates - the best martial arts schools in Foshan (until, in a thrilling contest, he eventually gets spanked by Ip Man). And if you don't absolutely end up loathing the sadistic Japanese colonel Sato, then actor Shibuya Tenma didn't do his job near well enough.Ip Man early on is reluctant to take on students, and it isn't until the Japanese invasion that he starts teaching the basics of wing chun to the bullied cotton mill workers. What I appreciate is the touch of realism that went into the scene in which the bandits return to the mill and the workers initially apply what wing chun they've learned but then quickly go back to cowering when they realize that they're still not cut out for serious brawling.My favorite moment has to be Ip Man simultaneously taking on ten Japanese fighters. But, oddly, my second favorite scene is when the fight between Ip Man and a challenger is put on pause when Ip's young son comes wheeling around in his bicycle to remind his dad that mom said not to break things in the house. This funny little moment was so unexpected, but it was a breath of fresh air, and it makes me like the movie that much more.There is some contrived melodrama featuring two brothers we don't really care about, and there's plenty of Japanese bashing that goes on here. But, hey, it's a Chinese film, so a measure of nationalism is probably expected. I don't know how faithful this movie is to Ip Man's biography. I wouldn't be surprised if certain liberties were taken. But I look at this movie more as a martial arts fable, and whether the story strays from what really happened or not sort of gets swept under the rug when you factor in the excellent acting, the stirring martial arts, and the superior production values. Yup, I'm calling it: IP MAN is simply a great movie.The Collector's Edition comes in 2 discs, with all bonus features available with English sub-titles.

This gives rise to Ip's soaring popularity among the people who, slowly but surely, sought him out to be their master and provide them martial arts instruction.It, then, focuses on the growing hardship faced by the Chinese people at the hands of Japanese aggressors who continually engage Chinese martial arts practitioners in matches in return for a sack of rice for every victory over their Japanese opponents, leading to innumerable being seriously injured and some tragic deaths on the part of the Chinese.Unable to withstand the bullying at the hands of the Japanese, Ip Man takes on all of the Japanese martial artists in a match where he easily defeats them, inducing, resultant of this, a desire by the Japanese general to challenge him to a duel. Ip defeats the general in a death blow and gets shot by the general's henchman.Based on a true story, Ip Man is truly a martial arts action masterpiece to be treasured.",5,The Birth of A Legend,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,1365,"['movie', 'propelled', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'international', 'stardom', 'gave', 'birth', 'legend', 'inspired', 'true', 'story', 'Bruce', 'Lee', 'mentor', 'one', 'greatest', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'time.The', 'story', 'depicts', 'Ip', 'Man', 'being', 'challenged', 'notorious', 'martial', 'artist', 'who', 'had', 'defeated', 'nearly', 'martial', 'arts', 'masters', 'Foshan', 'tournaments', 'find', 'worthy', 'opponent', 'prove', 'skill', 'only', 'find', 'badly', 'defeated', 'Ip', 'rise', 'Ip', 'soaring', 'popularity', 'people', 'who', 'slowly', 'surely', 'sought', 'out', 'be', 'master', 'provide', 'martial', 'arts', 'instruction.It', 'then', 'growing', 'hardship', 'faced', 'Chinese', 'people', 'hands', 'Japanese', 'aggressors', 'who', 'continually', 'engage', 'Chinese', 'martial', 'arts', 'practitioners', 'matches', 'return', 'sack', 'rice', 'victory', 'Japanese', 'opponents', 'leading', 'innumerable', 'being', 'seriously', 'injured', 'tragic', 'deaths', 'part', 'Chinese.Unable', 'withstand', 'bullying', 'hands', 'Japanese', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Japanese', 'martial', 'artists', 'match', 'where', 'easily', 'inducing', 'resultant', 'desire', 'Japanese', 'general', 'challenge', 'duel', 'Ip', 'general', 'death', 'blow', 'shot', 'general', 'henchman.Based', 'true', 'story', 'Ip', 'Man', 'truly', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'masterpiece', 'be', 'treasured']",N/A

The only thing I can say is the first ZHO option(2/3) the lips compared to dialogue is off way more than the second ZHO option.The subtitle is worse. You are given two options. Both ENG 1/2 & 2/2 First of all 1/2 is non-existent. Nothing there.  2/2 is the only option in reality. The subtitle is suspect. Some words, I think are used wrong, please correct me if I am wrong.  But they just don't seem appropriate. In the first scene both Master Liu and Ip man say PLEASE, that is in the subtitle and the eng dubbed. So maybe I am incorrect. Secondly, when Ip Man fights Master Jin, the Subtitle says I'll PAY when he takes form. The ENG dub he says PLEASE. After ruining a vase he again says I'LL PAY. which makes more sense....But like I said I might be mistaken, only speaking english.Also, the video quality, is suspect.

Yen is a fine actor as well as an insanely talented marital artist; his taciturn performance as Ip Man feels perfect in many ways, but never cheesy as so much of this genre can be.There are also some beautiful shots by director Yip, and a few of the early scenes are played almost slapstick, which works well and gives way to straight drama as the plot moves forward. Chinese hatred towards the Japanese occupiers is still palpable, and there is a touch of propaganda feel here.

The style that he uses in the film is Wing Chun which uses more arm and hand combat, and less kicking like the Mantis Style. There is one crucial point to this film, and that is Donnie Yen portrays the life of Ip Man. Ip Man was a master of Wing Chun in the 1930's from Fo Shan, China. This is the first film ever to be filmed about the life and times of Ip Man and it was worth the wait.

The movie reminded me of the recent Ong Bat with it's hard hitting fight scenes. Combining an engaging story with spectacular fight scenes, the movies tells the story of Ip Man, a famous wing chun master and his family set against the backdrop of the Japanese invasion of WWII.Sammo Hung, the heavy set but amazingly fast and agile Hong Kong and Hollywood veteran actor and martial artist, did the fight choreography (along with input from Ip Man's son, Ip Chun). There's some wire work, but it doesn't become the focus of the action, either. Wing chun as a style is presented accurately, too, showing its ability to control the center line and to defend and attack simultaneously. And the famous rapid fire ""wing chun blitz"" is also shown several times.Ip Man is of course famous in the west as the teacher of Bruce Lee. Wing chun is a very popular style of kung fu in China, and in Hong Kong, where it is primarily based, it's said that 20% of the practitioners study wing chun. The other popular style in Hong Kong is choy li fut. Wing chun is famous for it's rapid and versatile hand techniques, and choy li fut is famous for its many weapons. Wing chun also has the distinction of being the only style of kung fu invented by a woman.I didn't watch the extras on the DVD so I can't comment on those, but the video transfer was fine and I had no complaints there. I also had no trouble with the DVD freezing up and not playing as several people here who gave the movie one star reviews said.With a well developed story, competent acting (especially for a martial arts movie), a good script, and exciting fight scenes, Ip Man delivers on all fronts.

Judging from the cover picture, I guessed this movie was yet another over-blown, outrageous, ultra-violent and angry martial arts movie. In other words, I didn't have high hopes for it. After watching it for a half hour, though, I realized this movie was nothing like I expected. It was a rather calm, serious historical fiction movie that was based on actual events. The acting was good, the sets were good, and the fight choreography was the best I've ever seen. This movie had none of the supernatural Kung fu silliness of people jumping from building to building or kicking other people through walls or catching sword blades with their bare hands or stuff like that.The fight scenes were fast and furious and really a marvel to watch. I was unfamiliar with the actors or the director or anyone else in the movie, but everyone involved with it impressed me.The one thing that is a bit of a mystery to me is the R rating. This movie had two or three swear words and not much blood. Though there was a lot of Kung fu action, most of it was bloodless. There were a couple of shootings, but only one death by shooting. I think the R rating was too strong. A PG-13 rating would have been plenty strong. I would have no problem letting my 13-year old daughter or 11-year old son watch this movie.

I'm not talking about its merits as a set of fight scenes, which are mostly great. But you can't just ignore all the irresponsible crap that surrounds these scenes. I'm talking about the fact that Ip Man is just another in a recent string of shameless big-budget propaganda-like films coming out of China (""Hero"" is another example, though Ip Man is much more blatant and troubling).Look, normally I would be the last person to overanalyze a kung fu flick, let alone chastise filmmakers for taking on historical atrocities. But this movie sees itself as much more than just a kung fu flick, and that's the problem. I realize that what the Japanese did to the Chinese before/during WWII was horrific. And I also understand that U.S. studios are just as capable of putting out pugilistic propaganda as the Chinese (Rocky IV, anyone?). But there are important differences that make Ip Man truly shameless and worthy of criticism, from its blatant hypocrisy (the autocratic Chinese lecturing the Japanese about being ""civilized"" when they massacre their own people in Tiananmen Square and are consistently ranked among the world's top oppressors by numerous human-rights organizations? You've GOT to be kidding me!) to near-delusional historical revisionism (at the end of the movie, the narrator proudly declares that the Chinese forced the Japanese surrender in 1945!) to implicit racism (the movie doesn't just criticize past Japanese imperialism; it also tries to make a case for intrinsic Chinese superiority, then and now). The fact that top-shelf actors and martial artists lent their talents to such an enterprise, and that many reviewers are praising them for doing so, is truly disturbing to me.So for those of you who love good kung fu, I recommend just looking up the good fight scenes individually on YTube instead of sitting through all the propaganda BS.

Ip Man (played by Donnie Yen), desperate for food, finds that a Japanese general will trade rice for sparring partners for his men.  But when his friends are killed in the process, it then becomes a matter of honor, not hunger, that drives him.A secondary plot is when Ip Man fights a number of bandits trying to rob a friend's factory, and Ip Man trains the factory workers to protect themselves.After the war, Ip Man develops a martial arts school which produces Bruce Lee, among others.Much of the conversation seems stilted and shallow, but I suspect that was due in part to the translation (the film has subtitles in English).

The film effectively shows how martial arts is about so much more than just punching and kicking: in the film, and in the life of Ip Man, it becomes an embodiment of the Chinese national character, the expression of the dignity and spirit of the Chinese people, and a conduit for resistance to oppression.Donnie Yen does an excellent job of conveying the humility and dignity of the character. I found myself really getting caught up in his struggle to maintain his honor in the face of the wearying oppression of the Japanese.Of course, the fight scenes were terrific. The sets period costumes were also very well done and evocative, as was the music.The subtitles, as other reviewers noted, are rather iffy at least in the ""Ip Man Dual Subtitled"" edition I viewed. However, having lived through the years when the only subtitles available in most kung fu films were the British-mandated ones that old HK companies included in the film print, which were badly translated, and printed in white so it was impossible to read them, well, the bad translation was nothing new to me.In conclusion, this is a very enjoyable movie that not only features some fantastic choreography, but is also an inspiring and well-crafted Chinese national fable about war and resistance that is not simply a framework to hang some fight scenes off of- the fight scenes really are expressive of the theme and story.",5,The heart of the nation forms the fist of a man,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,1561,"['movie', 'blew', 'away-', 'expected', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'surprised', 'find', 'rousing', 'heartfelt', 'story', 'China', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'film', 'effectively', 'how', 'martial', 'arts', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'punching', 'kicking', 'film', 'life', 'Ip', 'Man', 'embodiment', 'Chinese', 'national', 'character', 'expression', 'dignity', 'spirit', 'Chinese', 'people', 'conduit', 'resistance', 'oppression.Donnie', 'Yen', 'excellent', 'job', 'conveying', 'humility', 'dignity', 'character', 'found', 'really', 'getting', 'caught', 'up', 'struggle', 'maintain', 'honor', 'face', 'wearying', 'oppression', 'Japanese.Of', 'course', 'fight', 'scenes', 'were', 'terrific', 'sets', 'period', 'costumes', 'were', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'evocative', 'was', 'music.The', 'subtitles', 'other', 'reviewers', 'noted', 'are', 'rather', 'iffy', 'least', 'Ip', 'Man', 'Dual', 'Subtitled', 'edition', 'viewed', 'However', 'having', 'lived', 'years', 'when', 'only', 'subtitles', 'available', 'most', 'kung', 'fu', 'films', 'were', 'British-mandated', 'ones', 'old', 'HK', 'companies', 'included', 'film', 'print', 'were', 'badly', 'translated', 'printed', 'white', 'was', 'impossible', 'read', 'well', 'bad', 'translation', 'was', 'nothing', 'new', 'me.In', 'conclusion', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'fantastic', 'choreography', 'also', 'inspiring', 'well-crafted', 'Chinese', 'national', 'fable', 'war', 'resistance', 'not', 'simply', 'framework', 'hang', 'fight', 'scenes', 'of-', 'fight', 'scenes', 'really', 'are', 'expressive', 'theme', 'story']",N/A

1244548,A1DV6NTPQRWZE3,B001W9EUC2,thepete8,"[3, 4]","Ip Man is a 'biopic' but - from the little I have read - it's probably only loosely based on its subject's actual life. Played by Donnie Yen (also seen in Seven Swords), Ip Man is a supremely talented martial artist who lives peacefully in Fo Shan, a place renowned for its martial artists. The Japanese invasion of China during WWII destroys his idyllic existence. Master Ip and everyone around him are suddenly poor and life becomes a brutal struggle for existence. In the movie, the former Fo Shan masters have to resort to going to a 'fight club' in order to earn bags of rice to stay alive. The film does a very good job of conveying the harsh existence of the time.In the title role, Donnie Yen's serene presence works very well. I've noticed in all of his films that he has this calm but powerful vibe emanating from him. It makes him a great choice to play a martial arts master. However, he is also able to convey deep emotion just by very subtle things he does with his face or posture. For instance, when he smiles, it's so rare that it takes on major importance. When he calls the translator Li a traitor, there's a sudden hardness in his face that's just a shade different from his usual stoicism, but it's enough and it tells you everything you need to know. I found myself just watching him very closely because of this, and his performance rewarded the attention.Admittedly, the plot of Ip Man is rather thin. There are several characters with arcs of one sort or another, but the movie ends up focused mostly on the horrors of life under the Japanese occupation as opposed to any deep insight into Master Ip or his philosophy (though there is certainly some of that to be found here). One big plus to this was that it left room for a lot of martial arts sequences to be smoothly woven into the story.On the downside the focus on the occupation - especially through the dingy, depressing light in which these scenes are filmed - rendered Ip Man a bit cold and soulless at times. I feel like a good martial arts movie, even one dealing with dark or tragic subjects, should still reflect the spirit of the martial arts (which is not about darkness or post-modern angst). While the movie clearly wants to convey the horrors of occupation, I think it would have been a better move (and more poignant) to rely upon the actors and characters to get this across. For example, the scene where Master Ip confesses to his wife how useless he feels was extremely touching, as was the scene when Yuan opens the mysterious tin box his brother had been searching for. The desperation of the millworkers and that of the bandits who blackmail them was also compelling, but this conflict really didn't go anywhere specific.Overall, I liked Ip Man and found it very moving, and I guess I'm picking at it because it's good enough to merit that kind of dissection. Most importantly, the martial arts sequences in Ip Man are very good. Much of the close-in fighting is especially tight and furious (and from what I understand the Wing Chun form is more about fighting at close range). Master Ip and Master Liu (another of the former Fo Shan masters) both had moves that make you want to reach for the rewind button. There was also great work from the actor who played the scruffy challenger from the north. A few less cuts would have enhanced the WOW! factor at times, and there is some unneeded use of wire fu. Not dissing wire fu in total, but the fact is that the best martial arts movies are the ones where you can best see the artists showing their skills with 'no strings attached' (that's why we watch!). So if you have good artists in the movie, it should be used sparingly. That said, Ip Man definitely delivers plenty of good martial arts, as well as a great performance from Donnie Yen and very moving story. Excellent movie!",4,Donnie Yen gives an awesome performance,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,3831,"['Ip', 'Man', ""'biopic"", 'little', 'have', 'read', 'probably', 'only', 'loosely', 'based', 'subject', 'actual', 'life', 'Played', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'also', 'seen', 'Seven', 'Swords', 'Ip', 'Man', 'supremely', 'talented', 'martial', 'artist', 'who', 'peacefully', 'Fo', 'Shan', 'place', 'renowned', 'martial', 'artists', 'Japanese', 'invasion', 'China', 'WWII', 'idyllic', 'existence', 'Master', 'Ip', 'everyone', 'are', 'suddenly', 'poor', 'life', 'brutal', 'struggle', 'existence', 'movie', 'former', 'Fo', 'Shan', 'masters', 'have', 'resort', 'going', ""'fight"", 'club', 'order', 'earn', 'bags', 'rice', 'stay', 'alive', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'conveying', 'harsh', 'existence', 'time.In', 'title', 'role', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'serene', 'presence', 'very', 'well', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'films', 'calm', 'powerful', 'vibe', 'emanating', 'great', 'choice', 'play', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'However', 'also', 'able', 'convey', 'deep', 'emotion', 'just', 'very', 'subtle', 'things', 'face', 'posture', 'instance', 'when', 'so', 'rare', 'major', 'importance', 'When', 'translator', 'Li', 'traitor', 'sudden', 'hardness', 'face', 'just', 'shade', 'different', 'usual', 'stoicism', 'enough', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'found', 'just', 'watching', 'very', 'closely', 'performance', 'rewarded', 'attention.Admittedly', 'plot', 'Ip', 'Man', 'rather', 'thin', 'are', 'several', 'characters', 'arcs', 'one', 'sort', 'movie', 'up', 'focused', 'mostly', 'horrors', 'life', 'Japanese', 'occupation', 'opposed', 'deep', 'insight', 'Master', 'Ip', 'philosophy', 'certainly', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'One', 'big', 'plus', 'was', 'left', 'room', 'lot', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'be', 'smoothly', 'woven', 'story.On', 'downside', 'focus', 'occupation', 'especially', 'dingy', 'depressing', 'light', 'scenes', 'are', 'filmed', 'rendered', 'Ip', 'Man', 'bit', 'cold', 'soulless', 'times', 'feel', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'even', 'one', 'dealing', 'dark', 'tragic', 'subjects', 'should', 'still', 'reflect', 'spirit', 'martial', 'arts', 'not', 'darkness', 'post-modern', 'angst', 'movie', 'clearly', 'convey', 'horrors', 'occupation', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'move', 'more', 'poignant', 'rely', 'actors', 'characters', 'get', 'across', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Master', 'Ip', 'wife', 'how', 'useless', 'was', 'extremely', 'touching', 'was', 'scene', 'when', 'Yuan', 'mysterious', 'tin', 'box', 'brother', 'had', 'been', 'searching', 'desperation', 'millworkers', 'bandits', 'who', 'blackmail', 'was', 'also', 'compelling', 'conflict', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'anywhere', 'specific.Overall', 'liked', 'Ip', 'Man', 'found', 'very', 'moving', 'guess', ""'m"", 'picking', 'good', 'enough', 'merit', 'kind', 'dissection', 'Most', 'importantly', 'martial', 'arts', 'sequences', 'Ip', 'Man', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Much', 'close-in', 'fighting', 'especially', 'tight', 'furious', 'what', 'understand', 'Wing', 'Chun', 'form', 'more', 'fighting', 'close', 'range', 'Master', 'Ip', 'Master', 'Liu', 'former', 'Fo', 'Shan', 'masters', 'had', 'moves', 'make', 'want', 'reach', 'rewind', 'button', 'was', 'also', 'great', 'work', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'scruffy', 'challenger', 'north', 'few', 'less', 'cuts', 'would', 'have', 'enhanced', 'WOW', 'factor', 'times', 'unneeded', 'use', 'wire', 'fu', 'Not', 'dissing', 'wire', 'fu', 'total', 'fact', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'are', 'ones', 'where', 'can', 'best', 'see', 'artists', 'showing', 'skills', ""'no"", 'strings', 'attached', 'why', 'watch', 'So', 'have', 'good', 'artists', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'used', 'sparingly', 'said', 'Ip', 'Man', 'definitely', 'plenty', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'performance', 'Donnie', 'Yen', 'very', 'moving', 'story', 'Excellent', 'movie']",N/A

1244552,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B001W9EUC2,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 0]","Watching a Hong Kong action films is a hit-and-miss affair. Some are great, some so-so, others just terrible, and ever-prolific actor Donnie Yen is no exception. As for his 2008 film ""Ip Man,"" an action-packed bio-pic loosely based on the life of the martial arts legend Ip Man (and master of Bruce Lee), this is definitely a hit.Set in the bustling city of the 1930s Foshan, the movie follows the story of Ip Man (Donnie Yen), a mild-mannered martial arts grandmaster respected in the community, whose life undergoes a drastic change when Japanese army invades China. Now impoverished, Ip Man works at a coal mine, where some of the workers are chosen by the Japanese soldiers to fight at the dojo of the Japanese general and karate practitioner Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi).One of the greatest assets of the film is, of course, its powerful martial arts fight sequences choreographed by Sammo Hung, especially the two battles between Donnie Yen and Fan Siu-wong as the leader of travelling martial arts fighters challenging Ip Man.  It is also notable that Donnie Yen has successfully created a unique heroic figure, an accomplished martial arts master of the Wing Chun style, who is also a wealthy family man. His likable portrayal of Ip Man greatly helps make the character believable, together with Donnie Yen's amazing martial arts skills (including the super-fast punching that will be seen in the sequel again).The storyline itself is pretty familiar, but acceptable. One thing I didn't like about the film is its rather short climax. Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, himself a judo practitioner, does his best as a Japanese general and karate fighter, but as a martial artist he is obviously no match for seasoned professional like Donnie Yen. ""Ip Man"" needs someone more convincing as a fighter, like Hiroyuki Sanada or actors of that caliber.Still, ""Ip Man"" is an exciting martial arts action film, much better than Donnie Yen's previous ""Flash Point."" With the excellent musical score of Kenji Kawai, ""Ip Man"" is one of the most impressive action films from the Hong Kong film industry of the new millennium.

I see this as a work evoking an aristocratic ideal with which we Westerners can identify--and I assume is meaningful to Eastern cultures as well.  The protagonist, born to rank and privilege, devotes himself to the martial arts tradition of southern China (that is, Canton).  Only reluctantly does he allow himself to be drawn into the fray populated by lesser beings--be they thugs and robbers, or the rapacious Japanese occupiers.  He meets each challenge, in turn, with a superior calm--his most severe gesture being that of rolling up his sleeve a few inches.

Mangy-looking bad guys move in on a town of peace-loving martial art masters and their schools. The peace-lovingest master of all, Master Ip, whups him handily and sends him packing, after a neatly choreographed duel. (The best part, for my taste, came when his small son tricycled into the mayhem to pass the message that Mom wants the fight over before they break the rest of the furniture.)This takes place in the 1930s, though, just before the outbreak of WWII. It's easy for Americans to forget the Sino-Japanese front of that war, which brutalized large swaths of the Chinese countryside. Master Ip's village falls, invaders commandeer his property and, like everyone else, his family falls into poverty under the invader's boot-heel. Master Ip takes the honorable route, finding what labor he can to support his family - a drop in social status that he takes with good grace, since he shares it with everyone else.The general of the occupying forces starts a vicious series of fights, using Asian martial arts but with a gladiatorial feel to the 'entertainments'. These culminate in a faceoff between Ip and that general, with the result you'd expect - and with a disproportionate effect on the morale of the occupied Chinese.As a plot mechanism, the lone defender of civil and family values stands as well in this movie as in scores of others before and since. This has special resonance, though, because of the historical background created by WWII, a legacy that survives even today in resentment at the atrocities committed back then. Perhaps the plot never excels (though some of the fight scenes do), but the historical setting taps into some very deep feelings.- wiredweird",4,"Great martial arts flick, but a bit more",1290211200,"11 20, 2010",2010,1747,"['one', 'level', 'fairly', 'ordinary', 'martial', 'arts', 'movie', 'Mangy-looking', 'bad', 'guys', 'move', 'town', 'peace-loving', 'martial', 'art', 'masters', 'schools', 'peace-lovingest', 'master', 'Master', 'Ip', 'whups', 'handily', 'packing', 'neatly', 'choreographed', 'duel', 'best', 'part', 'taste', 'came', 'when', 'small', 'son', 'tricycled', 'mayhem', 'pass', 'message', 'Mom', 'fight', 'break', 'rest', 'furniture', 'place', '1930s', 'though', 'just', 'outbreak', 'WWII', 'easy', 'Americans', 'forget', 'Sino-Japanese', 'front', 'war', 'brutalized', 'large', 'swaths', 'Chinese', 'countryside', 'Master', 'Ip', 'village', 'invaders', 'commandeer', 'property', 'everyone', 'else', 'family', 'poverty', 'invader', 'boot-heel', 'Master', 'Ip', 'honorable', 'route', 'finding', 'what', 'labor', 'can', 'support', 'family', 'drop', 'social', 'status', 'good', 'grace', 'shares', 'everyone', 'else.The', 'general', 'occupying', 'forces', 'vicious', 'series', 'fights', 'using', 'Asian', 'martial', 'arts', 'gladiatorial', 'feel', ""'entertainments"", 'culminate', 'faceoff', 'Ip', 'general', 'result', ""'d"", 'expect', 'disproportionate', 'effect', 'morale', 'occupied', 'Chinese.As', 'plot', 'mechanism', 'lone', 'defender', 'civil', 'family', 'values', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'scores', 'others', 'special', 'resonance', 'though', 'historical', 'background', 'created', 'WWII', 'legacy', 'even', 'today', 'resentment', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'back', 'then', 'Perhaps', 'plot', 'never', 'excels', 'fight', 'scenes', 'do', 'historical', 'setting', 'taps', 'very', 'deep', 'feelings.-', 'wiredweird']",N/A
1244563,A35S3VPS50CCX0,B001W9EUC2,W.Kim,"[12, 13]","A stately big budget period biopic, loaded with well choreographed, shot and edited fight scenes, of the martial artist widely credited for bringing Wing Chun kung fu from southern China to Hong Kong in the early twentieth century, and whose concepts and training ideas were adapted by his most famous student, Bruce Lee, who promoted those ideas as, ""the way of the intercepting fist,"" in his book, ""The Tao of Jeet Kun Do."" The film clearly emulates the scope of the Jet Li film, ""Fearless"" - which was about the redemption of the martial arts fighter, Hua Yuan Jia, who (at least in the heavily fictionalized ""Fearless"") overcame a egotistical brutality to leave behind a similarly impressive legacy in the worldwide spread of the JingWu school of martial arts and general physical education (a kind of YMCA offering kung fu training as well as other forms of physical education in several countries).  The film is also noteworthy for Donnie Yen's atypically restrained performance as Ip Man, a wealthy martial artist, who lived in a town filled with good teachers, and resisted the Japanese colonial government in southern China, when they pressured him to teach japanese soldiers, resulting, ultimately in the historical Ip Man having to flee occupied China, and emigrate to Hong Kong, where he eventually began teaching to make a living (something most martial arts film fans might know going into the film).However lacking the character arc Ronny Yu and the makers of ""Fearless"" imposed on the life story of Hua Yuan Jia (critics rightly point out Donnie Yen's Ip Man is nothing less than a living saint, and doesn't evolve at all as a character throughout the film) the filmmakers wisely make up for it by developing secondary characters drawn from the community Ip Man lives in before the Japanese invasion.  Some are forced to become collaborators with the occupation government, others are forced into matches with Japanese martial artists, others join tongs like the Axe Gang, which preyed on chinese civilians during the long period of the occupation and the chinese civil war.  All of these lives intersect with the newly dispossessed and impoverished Ip Man as he tries to survive, feed and defend his young wife and child, against the depredations forced on the southern chinese by the Japanese occupation, and eventually finds himself taking on challenge matches against japanese fighters, at first, to get food for his family, and then later, as a matter of principle.That aside, the film is chock full of good-to-great martial arts fight scenes, including friendly (and some not so friendly) matches between members of the Fo Shan Mountain's large community of martial artists before the Japanese invasion, and increasingly desperate battles afterwards, between struggling workers and gangsters, starving martial artists and japanese soldiers, and publicized challenge matches against Japanese martial artists set up to further humiliate the oppressed population.  Though I do think fight choreographer Sammo Hung, and Yen didn't quite manage to get across the efficiency and sheer finesse exhibited by real masters of the style (possibly better seen in two earlier wing chun-based films he directed, ""Warriors Two] and ""Prodigal Son""), Hung deserves a lot of credit for choreographing the increasingly brutal fight scenes in a way that shows how Wing Chun differs from other styles of chinese and japanese martial arts.  (A much more detailed discussion of the major fight scenes is up at [...] [...] for those with a strong interest in the technical side of these things.)  I particularly liked the performances of Yen (again, far more disciplined and restrained than usual), Louis Fan as a northern stylist, Hiroyuki Ikeuchi as a Japanese General, Xing Yu and Chen Zhihui, as Fo Shan Mountain martial artists.""Ip Man,"" is definitely worth seeing, and while it it doesn't quite match the dramatic strength of ""Fearless,"" the writers and filmmakers have crafted an interesting enough, well produced narrative to actually sit through the segments between the fight scenes, which is saying a lot these days. ""Ip Man, Part I"" has made pretty serious money (a sequel covering Ip Man's years in Hong Kong has been greenlit - I'm already looking forward to seeing who wins the big fight over who gets to play the young Bruce Lee) and I hope, along with ""Fearless"" it leads to more big budget period kung fu films with (hopefully) better and more interesting narratives than the usual ""theatre of revenge"" fare.  Judging from all the big budget period war movies (like ""Red Cliff I and II,"" ""Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon,"" ""The Warlords,"" ""Seven Swords,"" ""An Empress and The Warriors,"" ""A Battle of Wits"" coming out of China these days, it's clear the Chinese are willing to spend the money ... there's a good chance we'll also get more films like ""Fearless"" and ""Ip Man.""  Certainly there are no lack of candidates, (Wong Fei Hung, Yang Luchun, the Chen Family, Dong Haichuan, Yueh Fei, .. the list goes on) for cinematic canonization in the long, long history of Chinese martial arts.",4,"Solid big budget martial arts biopic in the same vein as ""Fearless""",1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,5113,"['stately', 'big', 'budget', 'period', 'biopic', 'loaded', 'well',

1244564,A2UUP58XPQW3GF,B001W9EUC2,"Woopak ""The THRILL""","[175, 196]","In the tradition of Jet Li's ""Fearless"" and ""Fist of Legend"", comes the fourth collaboration between the Wilson Yip-Donnie Yen tag team who also brought us the phenomenal ""Shah Po Lang"" in 2005. ""IP MAN"" is based on the life of the man responsible for making the Chinese kung fu style of ""Wing Chun"" (invented by a woman), which is up to this day, is among China's most revered style. Yes, Ip Man is also the man who has a huge number of talented disciples--most notably, the late great Bruce Lee.In the 1930's, the Chinese province of Fo Shan is a thriving place of martial arts schools, with various sects of different styles. Fo Shan is said to be the place where the famous Wong Fei Hung learned his art and therefore this place has a reputation. Ip Man (Donnie Yen) is a very accomplished martial artist but he keeps to himself, maintains a low profile and quietly spars with friends at home. But after an acknowledged victory over a fighter from the Northern quarter, Master Jin (Fan Siu Wong), Ip Man becomes an instant hero in Fo Shan.Time passes and in the late 1930's, following the Japanese invasion, Ip Man's property was confiscated by the Japanese army and his family is forced to live an abject existence. One day, general Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi), a fanatical practitioner in Karate, witnesses the skills of this Wing Chun master. The general becomes obsessed with Ip man, and demands that the Chinese style of Wing Chun be taught to the Japanese army. But Ip man refuses and instead challenges Miura to a duel. Ip Man has to uphold the benevolence of his art and protect Chinese dignity. The battle for national pride is about to begin....The one thing I know for sure is that Ip Man is indeed Bruce Lee's first teacher in Hong Kong for many years, and that Ip man was indeed asked to teach the Japanese; the rest of the significant historical details in this biopic is a little questionable. Yip and screenwriter Edmond Wong does get some details right, but please keep in mind that this is an action film first and foremost--it is hardly a historical drama. The action direction by Hong Kong legend Sammo Hung is indeed amazing, and it is the film's main draw. The story has the usual elements of honor, family, loyalty and pride and offers very little that is fresh--but this doesn't mean that it made the film any less exciting.There is very minor characterization involved. The film has three acts, and the first has Ip Man's status in the Fo Shan province. He is a business man and he doesn't teach his art, there are hints that he used to compete, but he decided to keep a low profile because of his wife, Cheng (played by Lynn Hung). His relationship with his wife and son is somewhat estranged at times because of his love for sparring--she throws a tantrum whenever he fights; Ip Man is a humble man, and shows his wife the respect due her. The second act portrays the effect of the Japanese invasion on the people of China, and on the life of Master Ip and his family--which leads to the film's min encounters. While Donnie Yen may indeed lack the necessary acting ability to portray him dramatically--he sure has the presence of a highly trained martial artist. Director Yip did the right thing in focusing more on fights than dramatic impact. There are also some touches of social commentary seeing as how some Chinese prey on their countrymen and they only look out for themselves.As I've said, Sammo Hung's action choreography is indeed phenomenal and it sure helps when you have a cast of real-life martial arts practitioners and action-honed actors such as Yen, Louis Fan and Hiroyuki Ikeuchi, who holds a Kuro Obi in Judo in real life. Sammo Hung maintains a nice balance between finesse, realism and downright brutality--the fights are very intense and very focused. It is a mix of the usual wire-fu and occasional acrobatics. Highlights include, Ip Man taking on 10 Japanese fighters in one time, the fight between Fan Siu Wong and Yen is quick but exciting, complemented with some subtle doses of humorous cracks. The fights are exquisitely shot, with multiple camera angles in a perspective view to close ups, so you can see all the hard-hitting action. There are also times when an opponent is thrown in the camera's view and I thought this added a lot of style and intense attitude. Wilson Yip and company knows how to shoot fight sequences and their skill proves the film's showstopper.The action encounters are nicely placed and Wilson Yip needs to be credited for maintaining an excellent pace with its balance between action and drama. While this film is historically inaccurate, for the most part, it does succeed as an action film--a very well done at that. The film does ultimately fail as a character-driven, true-to-life biopic. Donnie Yen's ""Ip Man"" is more about his capabilities as a fighter than who he really was as a man, which is no doubt due to fact that it wanted to maintain a China-friendly film. The film's structure more of a popcorn action film than an emotional biopic of a man who made his mark in using his fists to unite the Chinese people. It plays too fast and free to fully realize the film's potential as a ""based on true events"" type of deal.Despite some flaws in the script, and the filmmakers relying too much on the audiences' good beliefs rather than developing Ip Man as a man than as a caricature of a folk hero; (no doubt an attempt to match Wong Fei Hung in ""Once upon a Time in China"" and Huo Yuan Jia in ""Fearless"") to portray him as an inspirational role model/saint. ""IP MAN"" is a truly exciting film which is just full of action and the energy it exudes is just so much fun to watch. I am rather very interested in seeing as to what Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen would bring ""IP MAN 2"", which would hopefully show more of his experiences in Hong Kong (which may include his time with Bruce Lee). Of course, by that time, I've read that Wong Kar-Wai's version of ""IP MAN"" will be released and will hopefully have more historical significance as well as action thrills.Still, this film comes with a ""Highly Recommended"" rating from me, it does rule as martial arts action film.
