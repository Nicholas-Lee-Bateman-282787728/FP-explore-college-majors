911746,A1H4X50VE4K2W6,B0009S4IGA,"A. D. Bowman ""64panther""","[22, 23]","This is one of those movies that grabs you from the beginning and twist and slams you emotionally throughout the feature. The cast is extraordinary without the faintest hint of anyone being uncormfortable in their role. You get the sense that you're really there taking all this in. A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on, but the steady performance of Ms. Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful misfits. To single out anyone other than ""Nanny"" is an injustice because we have very good performances by great veteran actors including Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But it is Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Ms. Merkerson that makes this a wonderful experience. The movie moves rapidly and is short by todays standards, but it is without question one of the best movies you're going to see this year. If you like good period pieces that will challenge you emotionally, tug at your heart, lift you joyfully and have you tapping your feet at the same time, then this is the movie for you.

911762,A218J58CFFQOPW,B0009S4IGA,D. Myatt,"[4, 24]","I was being kind by giving this poorly-written film 2 stars: I thought the writing lacked focus, freshness and originality. Characters, such as Lou Gossett's, were introduced and then abandoned for the most part. And there was no true sense of cohesion between any of them. Also, quite a few cliches abound, and they were all hard to get around; they'd all been seen before in other, better, films within this genre. The dialogue was, at times, painful and predictable. Some of the acting, such as the main character kid's and the over-the-top Macy Gray's, left much to be desired. The fine actress portraying Nanny did a noble job at making the best of the inferior material that laid out before her--as did the ever-excellent Jeffrey Wright who, in my humble opinion, was the best thing in the film--despite a rather abbreviated appearance. Terrence Howard, Saul Williams and Delroy Lindo were all solid as well. Overall, I believe all the (rather unwarranted) positive reviews this film received speaks to a larger, more pressing issue: the profound desire of African Americans, like myself, to see their images on screen as multi-dimensional, complex, positive, non-buffoonish clowns or criminal, in uplifting and inspiring stories that truly capture the nuances that define our unique experiences in this world.",2,"UNFORTUNATELY, SPEAKS TO A LARGER ISSUE...",1143590400,"03 29, 2006",2006,1316,"['was', 'being', 'kind', 'giving', 'poorly-written', 'film', '2', 'stars', 'thought', 'writing', 'lacked', 'focus', 'freshness', 'originality', 'Characters', 'such', 'Lou', 'Gossett', 'were', 'introduced', 'then', 'abandoned', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'true', 'sense', 'cohesion', 'Also', 'quite', 'few', 'cliches', 'abound', 'were', 'hard', 'get', 'around', ""'d"", 'been', 'seen', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'genre', 'dialogue', 'was', 'times', 'painful', 'predictable', 'acting', 'such', 'main', 'character', 'kid', 'over-the-top', 'Macy', 'Gray', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'fine', 'actress', 'portraying', 'Nanny', 'did', 'noble', 'job', 'making', 'best', 'inferior', 'material', 'laid', 'out', 'did', 'ever-excellent', 'Jeffrey', 'Wright', 'who', 'humble', 'opinion', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'film', 'rather', 'abbreviated', 'appearance', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'Saul', 'Williams', 'Delroy', 'Lindo', 'were', 'solid', 'as', 'well', 'Overall', 'believe', 'rather', 'unwarranted', 'positive', 'reviews', 'film', 'received', 'speaks', 'larger', 'more', 'pressing', 'issue', 'profound', 'desire', 'African', 'Americans', 'see', 'images', 'screen', 'multi-dimensional', 'complex', 'positive', 'non-buffoonish', 'clowns', 'criminal', 'uplifting', 'inspiring', 'stories', 'truly', 'capture', 'nuances', 'define', 'unique', 'experiences', 'world']",Lackawanna Blues

This brilliant film ignites the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, superb direction by George C. Wolfe, and a cast so stunning that they make an encore viewing compulsory! Yes, it is just that good.The story is based on the author's life as the child 'Junior' (Marcus Carl Franklin) raised in the inimitable home of soulfully empathetic Rachel ""Nanny"" Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson),a lady who devoted her life to aiding the disenfranchised by transporting them from the South, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York.  The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about life from the inhabitants of the house - odd characters with painful pasts - and from the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family rescued by Nanny.  The myriad characters of the home are too numerous to outline but they are portrayed by some of the finest actors in the business: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr., Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper - the list goes on and on.In the course of the film we are introduced to the cruelties of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture, and the courage of one fine woman who battled all the hardships the world can dish out to maintain the dignity of those with whom she came into contact.  S. Epatha Merkerson is wholly submerged in this role, a role she makes shine like a beacon of reason in a world of chaos.  She offers one of the most stunning performances of the past years, and had this film been released in the theaters instead of as an HBO movie, she without a doubt would add the Oscar to place along side her Golden Globe award.The entire cast is exceptional and Wolfe handles the acting and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he pastes tiny moments of conversation with each character and Junior along with flashes of scenes from the story with the matrix of dance fests at the local clubs brimming over the top with incredible blues, jazz, dancing, and joy.  The production crew has mounted this little miracle of a picture with extreme care and never for a moment does attention lag from the momentum of the story.

What a terrific piece of filmmaking - interesting story and really good acting by a cast of well-known people. Based on the true story of Ruben Santiago Jr. and his relationship with his guardian Rachel Crosby, set in 1950's and 1960's Lackawanna, New York. This poignant and colorful drama tells the inspirational story of a courageous woman, Nanny, whose spirit and strength served as the foundation for a struggling community trying to survive during the segregation era. Starring an exceptional ensemble cast led by Jimmy Smits, Rosie Perez, and Macy Gray, this inspiring drama from HBO Films is a celebration of the good things in life, no matter how tough times may be.A great deal of care was given in the sets, costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated as the movie goes on, but the steady performance of Ms. Merkerson is so powerful that the movie ends before we've had our fill of the wonderful misfits.

Boki""","[0, 0]","Being a baby boomer growing up in the early 60s as a person of color, ""Lackawanna Blues"" is note perfect in capturing the sentiment of a time long gone. The most prophetic statement/assessment about those times comes near the end when Reuben Santiago, as a young man off to college, muses about the lost of a significant part of culture for people of color. It was the last time where one could experience the joys and tribulations of a cultured neighborhood. ""For every door that integration opened, another door was closed on the symbiosis of a segregated neighborhood"".S. Epatha Merkerson more than earns her well deserved ""Best Actress Emmy"", in yet another sterling HBO made for television cinema. She radiates the warmth and grace that the character is based on. Quite simply, I see so much of my childhood in ""Lackawanna Blues"" though on the surface, one would wonder, how?. The ""how"" is again the touching snapshot of a peoples taking care of each other, supporting each other, learning and growing from each other. With ""Momma's role""  being center stage, the viewer can not only see the importance of community that gathers, but, you can almost smell the delicious delicacies being cooked in the boarding house.The young actor that played Reuben as a child is simply magical. (He gives another knockout performance in ""I'm Not There"" as one of the Dylan characters. Again, I see myself in his role especially in how the love he has for ""Nanna or Momma"", and how she eventually takes care of him, more as a maternal figure than his own, troubled biological mother. Terrence Howard is convincing as the 17 year old junior of Momma's heart. Macy Gray in a small, but, effective role is funny and endearing. These are just a few standout performances in a movie that is filled with them.There was a house in our neighborhood that was just as transient with a wonderful array of personalities.George C. Wolfe had recently demonstrated his indisputable talent as a stage director in the Public Theater production of ""Radiant Baby"", a musical about Keith Haring.

911797,A3R1WFO4KIUQXZ,B0009S4IGA,PhotoGraphics,"[1, 1]","Lackawanna Blues is a fine movie that offers a colorful slice of Black Americana in the late `50s and `60s.  Like most autobiographical films it portrays history less like the way it was than the way the author would like us to think it was.I was born in Lackawanna only a few blocks from 32 Wasson Street where most of the movie takes place.  My dad worked for the steel plant, as did almost everyone in our family.  My large family of uncles, aunts and cousins lived in neighborhoods not far from Rachel Crosby's boarding house.  By the time the movie's author was a young boy we had become suburbanites living in the mostly white south-town suburbs.My young parents took my brothers and me to lower Ridge Road almost weekly to buy pastries from a local shop and before recycling became popular would donate old newspapers to help an already dying and decaying community. In Lackawanna in the 1950's the Black and White communities lived and worked side-by-side and were friends with each other.  The mix was about 70% Black and 30% Eastern European blue collar immigrants.  I never really met people who saw a difference in people's skin color until I went away to college.Lackawanna Blues completely ignores that 32 Wasson was walking distance from the Bethlehem Steel Plants, which spewed acrid yellow filth into the air night and day.  The movie's pristine neighborhood simply wasn't possible.  One of the cars, a yellow and white Buick hardtop, was identical to my dad's car and represented the ideals of white, suburban America.  While he drove that car on our weekly doughnut runs, a Buick is not likely a car like that would have been seen near 32 Wasson.  In that era most people in Lackawanna took the NFT bus to go to work or shopping.  The Black person who had money and wanted to show off would rarely choose anything less than a Cadillac.Another reality of life in Lackawanna is snow, lots of it.  It is hard to imagine a movie that spans 20 years or more without once showing the extreme hardship Buffalo weather added to an already challenging life.Period clothes in movies of this type give the viewer one of the clearest pictures of what life was like.  Although Lackawanna was poor and very run down, Black men and women, like their White counterparts, dressed the best they could whenever they were in public.  In Lackawanna, men wore loose-fitting suits and women tended to be a bit more flamboyant.  The movie overdresses the characters to the point of removing a lot of character from them.  The average person simply did not wear such flashy clothing at home, and the nightclub scenes would have us believe that Black Lackawannans were all wealthy socialites.  The average local bar was a far cry from the Hollywood night club-type imagery the movie showed us.I visited lower Ridge Road in 2006 and agree that the photos used at the end of the movie were accurate, today it looks like Afghanistan after a bombing.  As sad as they are, it is hard to imagine through pictures alone the brutal reality of a community that has long since died.While some of the characterizations of the movie missed on accuracy, that by no means takes away from what this movie is ... a wonderfully acted and richly textured peek at life as movies rarely show us.

She received an Emmy for her portrayal here and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement.Here she simply shines as THE guiding force and hand in her community.  This was especially poignant for me for I grew up in this very same time period.  The production detail was phenomenal and evoked wooooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50s & 60s and of women like Ms Merkerson portrayed.  She was thoroughly and ably accompanied by a hot, hot cast with performances one would enjoy over and over again. I first saw Macy Gray's name in the credits and went ho-hum.  Her performance was so good, I didn't even recognize her until about a 3rd of the way through. I am especially proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a feel and look of another beautiful era in African-American culture that is very tastefully done.Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less concerned with the racial fabric of the times but inifinitely more attuned to the richness of the characters and the emotional diversity they provide to exemplify that in the final analysis it is about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices.This is a worthy, elegant presentation of African-American life and is most assuredly destined to become a classic.

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[0, 2]","There were times in the film that I wondered whether it was really 1956 or the 30s, but regardless, I definitely enjoy films of the juke joint era where house parties are thrown regularly, the culture of dance (Lindy Hop?) is done with people throwing themselves on the dance floor, the tight atmosphere of love, and a feeling of family. This movie is told from the narrative viewpoint of a young boy who, after his parents had issues with taking care of him, they both agree to let Nanny take over. The young boy learns his street smarts from the other people living in the home (a lesbian, ex-convicts, handicapped, musicians, couples with domestic violence issues, beauticians, labor workers, and so forth). To someone like a social worker, this is the house from hell to raise a child in, but from the viewpoint of the boy and the giving nature of Nanny, this is a family and a home full of soul--soul music, soul food, and positive souls.  Once again, I was thrilled to find Mos Def in yet another movie, and as I knew he would, he played his role as a musician well, and I enjoyed his songs. Macy Gray acted as weird as usual, and nobody could've played crazy quite like she does. The woman who played Nanny did a great job as well, but I paid the most attention to Terrance Howard. I loved his role, with all of his faults and immature ways, he was my main focus. As a young, charismatic man trying to carry on a relationship with someone who people would find it slightly taboo to be with, still trying to enjoy his youthful years, and protect his home, he was a complex character that I found the most interesting.

911806,A912C7977MO6O,B0009S4IGA,Smallchief,"[6, 8]","""Lackawanna Blues"" is about a kind-hearted African-American woman named ""Nanny Crosby"" and the people living in the boarding house she owns. Apparently, the movie is based on fact. It takes place in the 1950s and 60s when there was a vibrant African American community and culture in Lackawanna, New York. (For those who aren't famiiar with the city, Lackawanna is near Buffalo and if probably best described as the buckle in the rust belt.)The boarding house is peopled by a mad collection of blues singers, maniacs, straight-razor toting women, drunks, and misfits.  Nanny manages them all with some exciting moments while raising a boy abandoned by his mother and father.  There's no plot to speak of; the movie is a biography of Nanny and her times, mostly from the viewpoint of a young boy. It's a busy movie with lots of action happening in the corners of the screen and a whole slew of sub-plots and character studies.  The music is good boozy blues; the actors are excellent.A couple of things were interesting to me.  First, there was a substantial multi-racial component to the movie and many of the characters seemed bi-racial. Was that in fact the case in Lackwanna?  Secondly, is the suggestion that African American culture and neighborhoods deterioriated as integration took hold and the isolation of the African-American community decreased.""Lackawanna Blues is a heart-warming movie with enough ambiguities to give it some depth.Smallchief",5,A suprisingly good little movie,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,1456,"['Lackawanna', 'Blues', 'kind-hearted', 'African-American', 'woman', 'named', 'Nanny', 'Crosby', 'people', 'living', 'boarding', 'house', 'Apparently', 'movie', 'based', 'fact', 'place', '1950s', '60s', 'when', 'was', 'vibrant', 'African', 'American', 'community', 'culture', 'Lackawanna', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'famiiar', 'city', 'Lackawanna', 'near', 'Buffalo', 'probably', 'best', 'described', 'buckle', 'rust', 'belt', 'boarding', 'house', 'peopled', 'mad', 'collection', 'blues', 'singers', 'maniacs', 'straight-razor', 'toting', 'women', 'drunks', 'misfits', 'Nanny', 'exciting', 'moments', 'raising', 'boy', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'father', 'plot', 'speak', 'movie', 'biography', 'Nanny', 'times', 'mostly', 'viewpoint', 'young', 'boy', 'busy', 'movie', 'lots', 'action', 'happening', 'corners', 'screen', 'whole', 'slew', 'sub-plots', 'character', 'studies', 'music', 'good', 'boozy', 'blues', 'actors', 'are', 'excellent.A', 'couple', 'things', 'were', 'interesting', 'First', 'was', 'substantial', 'multi-racial', 'component', 'movie', 'many', 'characters', 'seemed', 'bi-racial', 'Was', 'fact', 'case', 'Lackwanna', 'Secondly', 'suggestion', 'African', 'American', 'culture', 'neighborhoods', 'deterioriated', 'integration', 'took', 'hold', 'isolation', 'African-American', 'community', 'decreased', 'Lackawanna', 'Blues', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'enough', 'ambiguities', 'give', 'depth.Smallchief']",Lackawanna Blues
