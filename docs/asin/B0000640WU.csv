It's so nice to be stronger and able to lift or carry heavy items without any problems (I moved to a farm from the city and it's seems that I am always in need of strength for every day chores and working on an old house) I rotate this video with Yoga Zone's Strong and Healthy Back and STretching for Flexibility and get a wonderful over-all body strength building and flexibility. I have also noticed major health improvements in my back/neck areas. Also I used to get frequent migraines, those are completely GONE. Many other aches/pains have vanished, I often bore people with my long list of problems that have gone away since starting yoga/pilates. I am 35, not overweight, and feel better than I did at 20!

698959,A3N9D7Q4JC7494,B0000640WU,AvidReader,"[7, 7]","I agree with many other reviewers that this is not a beginner-level workout, but I also agree with the reviewer who points out that becoming more advanced is one of the goals of working out in the first place.  I am a very active person with moderate Pilates experience and I have no problem following this workout.  However, it is very fast-paced and contains little instruction on form, which may be frustrating for someone just starting out in Pilates/fusion workouts.If you have some experience and are looking for new challenges, though, this is a good addition to your library.  The moves include classic Pilates (Teaser, Roll-up, Criss-Cross), classic ballet (Releve, Demi-Plie), and some Denise-created variations ... it's a nice blend and does a good job of hitting multiple body parts.  The use of the resistance band is optional; I use it most of the time and enjoy the extra challenge.  I like that this workout includes a lengthier warm-up and cool-down, both of which incorporate some Tai Chi.  Many Pilates DVDs are short on these elements, so it's great to have them (I even use them as single chapters before or after other workouts).Now, a few negatives: first, again, the workout is very fast and while every ""body"" can technically do the moves, not ""everybody"" will enjoy the pace.  Also, Denise's enthusiasm is appreciated, but she really goes overboard here.  It wouldn't be a big deal if it were just an annoying trait, but the problem here is that it actually disrupts the workout.  She gets so busy saying, ""You look great,"" or ""Doesn't this feel wonderful?"" that she seems to forget to count reps (resulting in at least two sets in which one side gets worked longer than the other) and/or completely fails to cue new moves.  And, speaking of cueing, be forewarned that Denise assumes you are watching the TV - don't wait for descriptive cues or, sometimes, even a heads-up that she's about to change exercises.  It wasn't a big problem once I'd done the workout a few times, but it was frustrating the first time through.The bottom line is that Denise is quirky and sometimes over-enthusiastic, but she puts together a great routine and reminds you to have fun while working out.  Despite its drawbacks, I think this workout is a good optionn for those who have some Pilates experience and are looking for a challenging fusion routine.",4,"A great workout, with a few things to think about",1200182400,"01 13, 2008",2008,2361,"['agree', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'not', 'beginner-level', 'workout', 'also', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'out', 'becoming', 'more', 'advanced', 'one', 'goals', 'working', 'out', 'first', 'place', 'am', 'very', 'active', 'person', 'moderate', 'Pilates', 'experience', 'have', 'problem', 'following', 'workout', 'However', 'very', 'fast-paced', 'little', 'instruction', 'form', 'may', 'be', 'frustrating', 'someone', 'just', 'starting', 'out', 'Pilates/fusion', 'workouts.If', 'have', 'experience', 'are', 'looking', 'new', 'challenges', 'though', 'good', 'addition', 'library', 'moves', 'include', 'classic', 'Pilates', 'Teaser', 'Roll-up', 'Criss-Cross', 'classic', 'ballet', 'Releve', 'Demi-Plie', 'Denise-created', 'variations', 'nice', 'blend', 'good', 'job', 'hitting', 'multiple', 'body', 'parts', 'use', 'resistance', 'band', 'optional', 'use', 'most', 'time', 'enjoy', 'extra', 'challenge', 'like', 'workout', 'lengthier', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'incorporate', 'Tai', 'Chi', 'Many', 'Pilates', 'DVDs', 'are', 'short', 'elements', 'great', 'have', 'even', 'use', 'single', 'chapters', 'other', 'workouts', '.Now', 'few', 'negatives', 'first', 'again', 'workout', 'very', 'fast', 'body', 'can', 'technically', 'do', 'moves', 'not', 'everybody', 'will', 'enjoy', 'pace', 'Also', 'Denise', 'enthusiasm', 'appreciated', 'really', 'overboard', 'here', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'deal', 'were', 'just', 'annoying', 'trait', 'problem', 'here', 'actually', 'workout', 'so', 'busy', 'saying', 'look', 'great', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wonderful', 'forget', 'count', 'reps', 'resulting', 'least', 'two', 'sets', 'one', 'side', 'worked', 'longer', 'other', 'and/or', 'completely', 'cue', 'new', 'moves', 'speaking', 'cueing', 'be', 'forewarned', 'Denise', 'are', 'watching', 'TV', 'do', ""n't"", 'wait', 'descriptive', 'cues', 'sometimes', 'even', 'heads-up', 'change', 'exercises', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'problem', 'once', ""'d"", 'done', 'workout', 'few', 'times', 'was', 'frustrating', 'first', 'time', 'through.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'Denise', 'quirky', 'sometimes', 'over-enthusiastic', 'together', 'great', 'routine', 'have', 'fun', 'working', 'out', 'drawbacks', 'think', 'workout', 'good', 'optionn', 'who', 'have', 'Pilates', 'experience', 'are', 'looking', 'challenging', 'fusion', 'routine']",Denise Austin: Pilates for Every Body VHS
698960,AGG9C66TOLJZB,B0000640WU,"A. Woodley ""Patroness, Janeites, the Austen list""","[8, 11]","the trouble with this DVD is that it is too fast, too brief and with no real outline of pilates for 'everyone' as the title implies. This is a reasonable pilates work out for those who have done pilates in the past and want to try something new. However I found the conduct of each exercise too fast for me. I like to do my pilates slowly, and each exercise seems to be dynamic rather than some done quite slowly.There is little variation for beginnners who want to do simpler easier exercises. There was some brief discussion from austin about alternatives, but it is all done during the exercises, so it is of little use. It is definitely not for beginners either as it has no real discussion of how to hold yourself in the core, and anchor yourself to the floor. It is definitely a quick once over.I enjoyed some variation on the routine which she offers in this, but it is not recommended for the beginner as a starter to pilates. There are some very good books which can get your started, I loved Brooke Siler's book which gave an excellent discussion of how to achieve the core exercises and alternatives.",2,"Highly disappointing, definitely not for everyone",1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1111,"['trouble', 'DVD', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'brief', 'real', 'outline', 'pilates', ""'everyone"", 'title', 'implies', 'reasonable', 'pilates', 'work', 'out', 'who', 'have', 'done', 'pilates', 'past', 'want', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'However', 'found', 'conduct', 'exercise', 'too', 'fast', 'like', 'do', 'pilates', 'slowly', 'exercise', 'be', 'dynamic', 'rather', 'done', 'quite', 'little', 'variation', 'beginnners', 'who', 'want', 'do', 'simpler', 'easier', 'exercises', 'was', 'brief', 'discussion', 'austin', 'alternatives', 'done', 'exercises', 'little', 'use', 'definitely', 'not', 'beginners', 'real', 'discussion', 'how', 'hold', 'core', 'anchor', 'floor', 'definitely', 'quick', 'once', 'over.I', 'enjoyed', 'variation', 'routine', 'not', 'recommended', 'beginner', 'starter', 'pilates', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'books', 'can', 'get', 'started', 'loved', 'Brooke', 'Siler', 'book', 'gave', 'excellent', 'discussion', 'how', 'achieve', 'core', 'exercises', 'alternatives']",Denise Austin: Pilates for Every Body VHS

698962,A3FEX2RN3Q5XT4,B0000640WU,C. Daly,"[51, 63]","The title of this DVD is misleading.  It implies that anyone can do this workout, which is most certainly not the case.  Perhaps Denise Austin is so out of touch with reality she doesn't realize that most people are not as strong or flexible as she is.I have been doing Pilates at a studio for 5 months.  The classes were getting to expensive for me so I decided to start practicing at home with rented DVDs.  I would consider myself a low intermediate at pilates.  I found that this DVD used too many difficult moves that even I can't do, and Denise acted like they were nothing and provided few to no pointers on proper form (T stand, teaser).  If you are new to pilates and don't already have strong abdominal muscles you will probably injure yourself trying to do these moves.Overall I did not feel like I got as good of a workout from this DVD as I get from my normal routine, because I could not get in all the positions properly.  The workout also uses a resistance band, which I tried to use, but apparently my band is not as flexible or long as hers, because I could not get the same range of motion as she did and therefore the exercise did not have as much effect.  If you are relatively new to Pilates then I would not recommend this DVD.  Perhaps a more advanced practitioner would get more out it.

698964,A1YS5EZCF21PBS,B0000640WU,F. Ali,"[15, 16]","I recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone, no matter what your age or fitness level is. I used to be a workout maniac for a few years, but my busy college lifestyle kept me from working out and eating healthy, causing me to pack on a few pounds. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I started off with this DVD--and I am SO glad I did. I haven't shed much weight, but I definitely feel so much better about my body. I have more energy the days that I do pilates (3-4 times a week), and what I'm most proud of is that my abs have gone in considerably since starting this workout. Granted, bringing in those abs also requires that you eat less and healthier, but pilates has definitely helped tone them up.What I really love about this DVD (and Denise Austin in general) is that she's so perky and encouraging. Some people don't like this and find her rather annoying, but I think you should just take her super-positive attitude as a caring one. Whether or not she really does, I don't know...but I like to think that she does, and it helps me get through the entire workout when I don't really want to. :) While I said earlier that I didn't lose much weight from it, it's still a fantastic workout that DOES get you to sweat quite a bit, and by the end of it all, you're quite glad that it's time to stretch.If you're a beginner who wants to lose weight, do some over all toning, or just be more fit overall, this DVD is perfect. I'll say this though: We all have different bodies and levels of fitness, and some beginners will find this perfect for themselves, and others might find it a bit difficult. If you do find it a bit hard in the first workout, don't be fazed. You need to do the workout a few more times to get the hang of it (at regular intervals, of course. It won't help to use this DVD once a month) and I am positive that you'll find it easier the 2nd or 3rd time around. Lastly, while I swear by this pilates DVD, I'll be the first to admit that this workout alone will not give you a healthier heart and turn you into a size 0. To get a full, thorough workout to improve your health, you really need to combine this with cardio workouts (like kickboxing, jogging, etc..) and weight lifting. If you're at a level where you can pace yourself and mix around all these workouts, go for it. If not, start off with pilates and slowly work in these other workouts later.",5,Really is for every body!,1118448000,"06 11, 2005",2005,2412,"['recommend', 'DVD', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'fitness', 'level', 'used', 'be', 'workout', 'maniac', 'few', 'years', 'busy', 'college', 'lifestyle', 'kept', 'working', 'out', 'eating', 'healthy', 'causing', 'pack', 'few', 'pounds', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'decided', 'wanted', 'do', 'something', 'started', 'off', 'DVD', 'am', 'SO', 'glad', 'did', 'have', ""n't"", 'shed', 'much', 'weight', 'definitely', 'feel', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'body', 'have', 'more', 'energy', 'days', 'do', 'pilates', '3-4', 'times', 'week', 'what', ""'m"", 'most', 'proud', 'abs', 'have', 'gone', 'considerably', 'starting', 'workout', 'Granted', 'bringing', 'abs', 'also', 'eat', 'less', 'healthier', 'definitely', 'helped', 'tone', 'really', 'love', 'DVD', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'general', 'so', 'perky', 'encouraging', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'find', 'rather', 'annoying', 'think', 'should', 'just', 'take', 'super-positive', 'attitude', 'caring', 'one', 'not', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'like', 'think', 'get', 'entire', 'workout', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'said', 'earlier', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'much', 'weight', 'still', 'fantastic', 'workout', 'get', 'sweat', 'quite', 'bit', 'end', ""'re"", 'quite', 'glad', 'time', 'stretch.If', ""'re"", 'beginner', 'who', 'lose', 'weight', 'do', 'toning', 'just', 'be', 'more', 'fit', 'overall', 'DVD', 'perfect', ""'ll"", 'say', 'though', 'have', 'different', 'bodies', 'levels', 'fitness', 'beginners', 'will', 'find', 'perfect', 'others', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'difficult', 'do', 'find', 'bit', 'hard', 'first', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fazed', 'need', 'do', 'workout', 'few', 'more', 'times', 'get', 'hang', 'regular', 'intervals', 'course', 'wo', ""n't"", 'help', 'use', 'DVD', 'once', 'month', 'am', 'positive', ""'ll"", 'find', 'easier', '2nd', '3rd', 'time', 'around', 'Lastly', 'swear', 'pilates', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'first', 'admit', 'workout', 'alone', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'healthier', 'heart', 'turn', 'size', '0', 'get', 'full', 'thorough', 'workout', 'improve', 'health', 'really', 'need', 'combine', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'kickboxing', 'jogging', 'etc..', 'weight', 'lifting', ""'re"", 'level', 'where', 'can', 'pace', 'mix', 'workouts', 'go', 'not', 'start', 'off', 'pilates', 'slowly', 'work', 'other', 'workouts', 'later']",Denise Austin: Pilates for Every Body VHS

If you haven't done Pilates before, it will take a couple of workout sessions for you to figure out the moves, but give it a chance and keep trying. This tape isn't for those who are already intermediate or advanced with Pilates. It's more for beginners who already have somewhat of a fitness level. But don't let being out of shape stop you from trying. If you can't do the moves at first, there are modifications that you can do instead until you can do the full move. Some moves like a full T-stand are difficult, but easily modified.Some of the Pilates moves are done standing up, which is a change from most Pilates workouts. And for beginners, the moves will seem awkward. But you will see results.As usual, if you don't enjoy Denise Austin's chatter, then turn the sound down and just follow the movements. She doesn't chat up too much in this workout though.

698968,A1SWMOHC2S4HB5,B0000640WU,"Raina Singh ""Mmmarshmallow""","[11, 13]","This DVD is far too challenging for anyone wanting to get started in Pilates.  Denise herself says that its not the number of repitions that you do, but the quality of the repititions that make the workout effective.  Now, I am a Denise Austin fan, so her chirpiness does not bother me.  In fact, Mari Winsor seems boring and uncharismatic next to her, but I would sooner have Mari Winsor instructing me on how to execute Pilates moves rather than Denise - simply because Denise jumps right into the exercises.For cardio routines like the ones in Power Zone and Personal Training System, I am not so bothered, but Pilates is a form-based practice, and Denise just assumes that everyone will be able to mirror her movements perfectly and without causing injury.However, there are segments to this DVD that have merit.  The dynamic warmup is a great way to wake your body up - even if you're not going to do Pilates.  I do it quickly as a warmup before I go to cricket practice, and in the morning before I have my breakfast.  The stretching segment at the end of the DVD I do in the evenings before I go to sleep.All that being said, the workout itself is very challenging and I look forward to being able to complete it.  Though like I said, there is very little instruction, and I would consider it to be very unsafe to try and teach yourself Pilates from this DVD alone.  I recommend that you either go to a Pilates studio and learn the poses with an instructor since this is the best way, or do some of the Winsor Pilates DVDs before you do this one, or buy ""Pilates - Bodies in Motion"" by Alycea Ungaro.This workout is good. They should rename it to 'The Pilates Challenge' or something more relevant. Its just not for everybody.",3,For everybody?

698969,A1A9TE0NBFFYI,B0000640WU,Teresa Moon,"[0, 0]",This tape does some basic Pilates moves and incorporates the use of resistance bands and a chair or wall to support you. Be careful when you purchase some resistance bands as they come in a variety of resistance strengths.  This is a 45 minute tape and it done better in one session.  I like Denise Austin tapes as I like her attitude and her personality.,5,Good workout in my opinion,1174608000,"03 23, 2007",2007,355,"['tape', 'basic', 'Pilates', 'moves', 'use', 'resistance', 'bands', 'chair', 'wall', 'support', 'Be', 'careful', 'when', 'purchase', 'resistance', 'bands', 'come', 'variety', 'resistance', 'strengths', '45', 'minute', 'tape', 'done', 'better', 'one', 'session', 'like', 'Denise', 'Austin', 'tapes', 'attitude', 'personality']",Denise Austin: Pilates for Every Body VHS
