Rent it, and then decide if you want to buy it.  And with that said, if you are a fan of independent film making buy it to support the craft after you rent it.This is Not Oscar material but it will punch you in the gut at a sensory level. So what does that mean?  You're going to walk away from this feeling something and that today is hard to accomplish in film.  You're going to be emotionally slapped in the face about the love of two brothers, a drunken cop (Billy Crystal) who listens to an old man to save his marriage, Rosie Perez in make up as a nurse in a stellar look, did I mention a murder with a dog eating a toe.No special effects, just interesting acting, pain, angst, emotion that makes you wonder about the relationships people have.  The scene with the odd ball mother reminded me that we should all value our family and friends more.  The love displayed by a women to her waste of a son, because it was her fault he failed is touching.  The son hits a nerve with his acting.This movie hurts and feels good on so many levels.  And with that said, the average person is going to hate this film.  But for a select few, it will make you laugh and wonder how in the hell films like this get made; and thank God they do.A bald guy walks around in jockey underwear dealing with his locked up brother in a mental institution and the people that live in his apartment complex.  In the end it's about humans and love among people.  I think James Caan's lines to Billy Crystal about saving his marriage are killer.  An old man, helping a young man giving him insight into life.  The scene where the lead, Matt screams in his classic neon green pinto to the song, 'he's my brother' if you have a brother is powerful on so many levels.  Here is a character that most of us cannot relate to, his look, his walking around in underwear, he is a total cola drinking, pickle eating freak, yet, most of us can totally understand his pain over the hurt about his brother.Watch the filming and enjoy it for the genre and the style.  The pace on this film is slow and intent on making you think.",3,"Odd indie movie, with an emotional punch to it",1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,2196,"['Let', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'quickly', 'odd', 'movie', 'will', 'hate', 'enjoy', 'Rent', 'then', 'decide', 'want', 'buy', 'said', 'are', 'fan', 'independent', 'film', 'making', 'buy', 'support', 'craft', 'rent', 'it.This', 'Not', 'Oscar', 'material', 'will', 'punch', 'gut', 'sensory', 'level', 'So', 'what', 'mean', ""'re"", 'going', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'something', 'today', 'hard', 'accomplish', 'film', ""'re"", 'going', 'be', 'emotionally', 'slapped', 'face', 'love', 'two', 'brothers', 'drunken', 'cop', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'who', 'old', 'man', 'save', 'marriage', 'Rosie', 'Perez', 'make', 'up', 'nurse', 'stellar', 'look', 'did', 'mention', 'murder', 'dog', 'eating', 'toe.No', 'special', 'effects', 'just', 'interesting', 'acting', 'pain', 'angst', 'emotion', 'wonder', 'relationships', 'people', 'have', 'scene', 'odd', 'ball', 'mother', 'reminded', 'should', 'value', 'family', 'more', 'love', 'displayed', 'women', 'waste', 'son', 'was', 'fault', 'failed', 'touching', 'son', 'nerve', 'acting.This', 'movie', 'hurts', 'feels', 'good', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'said', 'average', 'person', 'going', 'hate', 'film', 'select', 'few', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'wonder', 'how', 'hell', 'films', 'get', 'made', 'thank', 'God', 'do.A', 'bald', 'guy', 'walks', 'jockey', 'underwear', 'dealing', 'locked', 'up', 'brother', 'mental', 'institution', 'people', 'live', 'apartment', 'complex', 'end', 'humans', 'love', 'people', 'think', 'James', 'Caan', 'lines', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'saving', 'marriage', 'are', 'killer', 'old', 'man', 'helping', 'young', 'man', 'giving', 'insight', 'life', 'scene', 'where', 'lead', 'Matt', 'classic', 'neon', 'green', 'pinto', 'song', 'brother', 'have', 'brother', 'powerful', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'Here', 'character', 'most', 'can', 'not', 'relate', 'look', 'walking', 'around', 'underwear', 'total', 'cola', 'drinking', 'pickle', 'eating', 'freak', 'yet', 'most', 'can', 'totally', 'understand', 'pain', 'hurt', 'brother.Watch', 'filming', 'enjoy', 'genre', 'style', 'pace', 'film', 'slow', 'intent', 'making', 'think']",Small Apartments

1612176,A2Z3643FSM4PAQ,B00AIZ282U,Joe Smart,"[3, 7]","Oddball comedy drama about a weird, bald man who lives in a crummy apartment, spends almost the entire movie in his underpants and nothing else, dreams of moving to Switzerland for reasons never explained and, oh yeah, has the body of his dead landlord lying on the floor.  This has a phenomenal cast but as is usually the case with movies that have a large number of excellent actors most of them are underutilized.  Juno Temple has a couple of scenes.  Rebel Wilson has one scene.  Peter Stormore has more screen-time as a dead body than he does alive.  Rosie Perez has one scene.  Amanda Plummer has one scene.  DJ Qualls has one scene.  Dave Koechner has a couple of scenes.  Dolph Lundgren, who is especially game, has a few scenes.  It's kind of a waste to hire all of these talented people and give them barely anything to do.  Of the supporting cast only James Caan as the main character's cranky neighbor, Billy Crystal as a sad-sack fire investigator and Johnny Knoxville as a stoner convenience store clerk who seems unusually smart for a stoner are given enough screen-time to really make any impression.  There's really only one funny sequence in the whole movie--the main character tries to transport his landlord's body and make his death look like a suicide in the most inept way imaginable.  The rest of the movie just struck me being kind of depressing and pointless--although I will admit that I've never seen anything else exactly like it.
