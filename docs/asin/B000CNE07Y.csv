958914,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B000CNE07Y,A Reviewer,"[4, 7]","I was kind of disappointed. Even though distributor Fox decided not to release the movie theatrically in the US, I still kind of hoped that the movie would be great. But it's just not. When I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but notice that they basically crammed as many big events from the book in as possible, but left out the main point of the book, which was these orphan kids living together in a movie theater, and how they've all become like a family. The movie just kind of misses this point completely, instead choosing to go from one big event to another and barely giving these characters any time to sit down and simply chat with eachother, letalone actually develop.The movie alters the timeline a bit; Prosper and Bo had been living with the Thief Lord and the other homeless kids for a while when the book started. In the movie, they basically just moved in, so they just meet the thief lord and the other kids at the start of the movie. So over the course of the movie, there is really no great friendship between them. It seems like they're more like acquaintances than people who become life-long friends with these street kids.Without the developed friendship between these characters, there's just no...importance to anything. Nothing seems to be at stake. When the big plot twist is revealed, it's a big ""so what?"" to those who haven't read the book; you didn't get to know these characters or the Thief Lord enough to really care.Without all the character development, this movie just flies...QUICKLY. The big plot twist that happens about half way through the book, (You know it if you read the book,) happens only 30 minutes into the movie. Just to give you an idea of how quickly this goes by.Other flaws in the movie are flaws carried over from the book which are made somewhat worse. One complaint that I had about the book was that these characters were just too law-abiding for street kids. But the movie takes this even further; in a movie about street kids, NOTHING, not a single thing, is stolen in this movie. And yes, for those who read the book, in the movie, they don't keep the fake money. Also, what happens to Barbarino seemed kind of farfetched in the book, but in the movie, all realism is COMPLETELY lost regarding this plot point. Similarly, the book's first half was excellent, while the 2nd half was kind of a step down...the movie, unfortunately, basically rushes through the first half to get to the 2nd half, which means there's about 20 minutes at the start of this movie that are really great...then it just kind of loses steam.Overall, I was really disappointed with this. What we have here is a movie that speeds through the book's big events but forgets the main themes of the book and leaves these characters kind of in the dark. Hornet is reduced almost to a cameo, Mosca's character bares almost no resemblance to the character in the book, Riccio's thievery is never mentioned, Scipio isn't nearly as arrogant and stubborn as he should be....yet Prosper and Bo's relationship, (the 2 brothers who are the main characters) actually ends up working well. The acting was good all around, and of course Venice makes for some cool scenery. The movie also does a good job (a great job, actually) of picking up the pacing near the end. (The movie ends shortly after the Isola Segreta scenes, yet almost everything is included.) Victor and Ida were perfectly cast, as was Barbarosa, (although his beard isn't red in the movie...) But, of course, the movie ends on a happy note whereas the book's ending was, I thought, supposed to be kind of bittersweet.What we have here is a movie for the younger kids, basically. It takes the chase scenes and the good scenery from the book and kind of throws it together, but (possibly in an effort to keep up the pacing to appeal to a younger audience,) the character development is completely lost. Younger kids will love it; it's simple enough to understand and probably fast enough so they won't get bored. But older viewers who haven't read the book may be put off by how shallow it ends up being, and those who have read the book may be disappointed by how simplified the story was and how character-less these characters are.",2,Strictly a film for the little kids.,1144022400,"04 3, 2006",2006,4226,"['was', 'kind', 'disappointed', 'Even', 'distributor', 'Fox', 'decided', 'not', 'release', 'movie', 'theatrically', 'US', 'still', 'kind', 'hoped', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'just', 'not', 'When', 'was', 'watching', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'basically', 'crammed', 'many', 'big', 'events', 'book', 'possible', 'left', 'out', 'main', 'point', 'book', 'was', 'orphan', 'kids', 'living', 'together', 'movie', 'theater', 'how', ""'ve"", 'become', 'family', 'movie', 'just', 'kind', 'misses', 'point', 'completely', 'instead', 'choosing', 'go', 'one', 'big', 'event', 'barely', 'giving', 'characters', 'time', 'sit', 'down', 'simply', 'chat', 'eachother', 'letalone', 'actually', 'develop.The', 'movie', 'timeline', 'bit', 'Prosper', 'Bo', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'other', 'homeless', 'kids', 'while', 'when', 'book', 'started', 'movie', 'basically', 'just', 'moved', 'just', 'meet', 'thief', 'lord', 'other', 'kids', 'start', 'movie', 'So', 'course', 'movie', 'really', 'great', 'friendship', ""'re"", 'more', 'acquaintances', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'life-long', 'friends', 'street', 'kids.Without', 'developed', 'friendship', 'characters', 'just', 'importance', 'anything', 'Nothing', 'be', 'stake', 'When', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'revealed', 'big', 'so', 'what', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'characters', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'enough', 'really', 'care.Without', 'character', 'development', 'movie', 'just', 'flies', 'QUICKLY', 'big', 'plot', 'twist', 'way', 'book', 'know', 'read', 'book', 'only', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Just', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'quickly', 'by.Other', 'flaws', 'movie', 'are', 'flaws', 'carried', 'book', 'are', 'made', 'somewhat', 'worse', 'One', 'complaint', 'had', 'book', 'was', 'characters', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'law-abiding', 'street', 'kids', 'movie', 'even', 'further', 'movie', 'street', 'kids', 'NOTHING', 'not', 'single', 'thing', 'stolen', 'movie', 'yes', 'who', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'keep', 'fake', 'money', 'Also', 'what', 'Barbarino', 'seemed', 'kind', 'farfetched', 'book', 'movie', 'realism', 'COMPLETELY', 'lost', 'regarding', 'plot', 'point', 'Similarly', 'book', 'first', 'half', 'was', 'excellent', '2nd', 'half', 'was', 'kind', 'step', 'down', 'movie', 'unfortunately', 'basically', 'first', 'half', 'get', '2nd', 'half', '20', 'minutes', 'start', 'movie', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'then', 'just', 'kind', 'loses', 'steam.Overall', 'was', 'really', 'disappointed', 'What', 'have', 'here', 'movie', 'book', 'big', 'events', 'main', 'themes', 'book', 'characters', 'kind', 'dark', 'Hornet', 'reduced', 'almost', 'cameo', 'Mosca', 'character', 'almost', 'resemblance', 'character', 'book', 'Riccio', 'thievery', 'never', 'mentioned', 'Scipio', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'as', 'arrogant', 'stubborn', 'should', 'be', '.yet', 'Prosper', 'Bo', 'relationship', '2', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'actually', 'up', 'working', 'well', 'acting', 'was', 'good', 'course', 'Venice', 'cool', 'scenery', 'movie', 'also', 'good', 'job', 'great', 'job', 'actually', 'picking', 'up', 'pacing', 'end', 'movie', 'shortly', 'Isola', 'Segreta', 'scenes', 'yet', 'almost', 'everything', 'included', 'Victor', 'Ida', 'were', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'was', 'Barbarosa', 'beard', ""n't"", 'red', 'movie', 'course', 'movie', 'happy', 'note', 'book', 'ending', 'was', 'thought', 'supposed', 'be', 'kind', 'bittersweet.What', 'have', 'here', 'movie', 'younger', 'kids', 'basically', 'chase', 'scenes', 'good', 'scenery', 'book', 'kind', 'throws', 'together', 'possibly', 'effort', 'keep', 'up', 'pacing', 'appeal', 'younger', 'audience', 'character', 'development', 'completely', 'lost', 'Younger', 'kids', 'will', 'love', 'simple', 'enough', 'understand', 'probably', 'fast', 'enough', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'bored', 'older', 'viewers', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'how', 'shallow', 'up', 'being', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'how', 'simplified', 'story', 'was', 'how', 'character-less', 'characters', 'are']","Thief Lord, The"

Its production quality is first rate, but the values in it are horrible from a traditional values point of view.  The Thief Lord is a son of a wealthy family that steals.  In a way, he is a fifteen year old Robin Hood.  It isn't made clear what he does with the money, except that he seems to support a bunch or orphans and runaway kids.  There is a bit of fantasy in the story as a magical merry-go-around turns kids into adults and adults into kids.  If parents show this movie to their kids, there is much to discuss.  I sometimes say that nobody is completely useless; they can always be used as a bad example.  I'd say the same about this movie - it isn't completely useless, parents can point out all these kids are doing wrong or immorally.  However, there are so many great movies with good traditional values that it seems pointless to waste time on one such as this.

958917,A27FR2C67JPDRS,B000CNE07Y,Daryl B,"[1, 1]","I thoroughly enjoyed Corneilia Funke's book, for which this movie is based, and was quite surprised when one of my cousins showed me that it had been made into a film.  The book is charming and very entertaining and from what I've read, Ms. Funke is the third most popular children's writer in Europe.The story follows two young orphans, Boniface (Bo) and Prosper, his older brother.  Prosper leaves the orphange he had been placed in and rescues Bo from the cluthches of their dreadful uncle and aunt.  Immediately they run off to Venice, a magical city that their dead mother often told them about.  Once there, they encounter a group of young thieves lead by Scipio, the charasmatic Thief Lord, who acts as a sort of paternal figure to the motley crew, who live in a dilapidated theater.With a bumbling, yet kindly detective on their trail via their aunt and uncle, Bo and Prosper find sanctuary with their new friends and are drawn up in a mystery involving a strange item that the Thief Lord has been hired to retrieve.  An old man and his sister need the object, a huge wooden wing, to complete a magical merry-go-round that supposedly can make the young older or the older young again.  Will the Thief Lord be able to obtain the item?  Will the group of young bandits make away with the huge fortune promised for its retrieval?  And does the merry-go-round really work?  All parts of Funke's entertaining work of children's literature.For me, the movie just didn't have the magical quality of the book.  Not that this is a bad film and I think children will enjoy it----I still think it could have been given a better treatment for the big screen.  That said, I think people who enjoyed the book may still enjoy the film version as well.  My recommendation, however, is stick with the book.

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[23, 23]","Up until the day that I saw ""The Thief Lord"" on the DVD shelf, I was entirely unfamiliar with it and the book it's based on.  It was a wonderful surprise.  It follows the lives of two young boys named Prosper and Boniface who trek off to Venice in order to remain together after losing their mother.  She always told them how magical Venice was, and their expectations were high.  Instead, they are left to fend for themselves on the street until they meet the Thief Lord.  He's sort of a cross between Robin Hood and Peter Pan, though his intentions aren't to stay young forever.The Thief Lord houses a small band of orphans in an old theater, and Prosper and Bo join them.  They gain the trust of the group when Prosper haggles with a local antiques dealer and garners a large sum of money for the group.  As the story rolls along, Bo and Prosper's relatives hire a private eye to seek them out.  They also run into a nice photographer who ends up helping them quite a bit during their adventures.  Eventually, the duo uncover some wild information about the Thief Lord, hunt for a magical wing, and help there fellow orphans along the way.  It's all done in a wonderful and child-like fashion.  The magic of Venice is slowly revealed and results in quite a grand climax.  The antiques dealer adds a nice bit of comic relief, especially near the end of the film.In closing, give ""The Thief Lord"" a chance.  It doesn't have the same budget as many other modern ""family friendly"" films, but it is a much better film overall.  It's getting a lot of comparison to the ""Harry Potter"" flicks, but I believe that it stands apart from that film and really doesn't have much in common with it other than the English accents.  I highly recommend it, especially if you have children, but I even recommend it to adults who simply enjoy magical tales.",4,Wonderful For The Whole Family,1148947200,"05 30, 2006",2006,1840,"['Up', 'day', 'saw', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'DVD', 'shelf', 'was', 'entirely', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'based', 'was', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'lives', 'two', 'young', 'boys', 'named', 'Prosper', 'Boniface', 'who', 'trek', 'off', 'Venice', 'order', 'remain', 'together', 'losing', 'mother', 'always', 'told', 'how', 'magical', 'Venice', 'was', 'expectations', 'were', 'high', 'Instead', 'are', 'left', 'fend', 'street', 'meet', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'sort', 'cross', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Peter', 'Pan', 'intentions', 'are', ""n't"", 'stay', 'young', 'forever.The', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'houses', 'small', 'band', 'orphans', 'old', 'theater', 'Prosper', 'Bo', 'join', 'gain', 'trust', 'group', 'when', 'Prosper', 'local', 'antiques', 'dealer', 'garners', 'large', 'sum', 'money', 'group', 'story', 'rolls', 'Bo', 'Prosper', 'relatives', 'hire', 'private', 'eye', 'seek', 'out', 'also', 'run', 'nice', 'photographer', 'who', 'up', 'helping', 'quite', 'bit', 'adventures', 'Eventually', 'duo', 'wild', 'information', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'hunt', 'magical', 'wing', 'help', 'there', 'fellow', 'orphans', 'way', 'done', 'wonderful', 'child-like', 'fashion', 'magic', 'Venice', 'slowly', 'revealed', 'results', 'quite', 'grand', 'climax', 'antiques', 'dealer', 'nice', 'bit', 'comic', 'relief', 'especially', 'end', 'film.In', 'closing', 'give', 'Thief', 'Lord', 'chance', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'budget', 'many', 'other', 'modern', 'family', 'friendly', 'films', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'overall', 'getting', 'lot', 'comparison', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'flicks', 'believe', 'apart', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'common', 'other', 'English', 'accents', 'highly', 'recommend', 'especially', 'have', 'children', 'even', 'recommend', 'adults', 'who', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'magical', 'tales']","Thief Lord, The"
