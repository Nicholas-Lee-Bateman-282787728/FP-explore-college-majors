I was SO disappointed in this movie, looking for the real story of the Snow Queen and at the suggestion of a friend to compare it to the plot of the &#34;Frozen&#34; movie, that I am giving it away to get it out of my DVD collection for a more &#34;worthy&#34; space. The acting was really bad, the filming and &#34;so-called&#34; special effects were pathetic, and it left me with a pit in my stomach for even wasting my money on it! Don't waste yours!

1028608,A3T46X7M3AUDAB,B000JLTS7Q,William Timothy Lukeman,"[2, 2]","This version of the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale must be the most visually rich & gorgeous one yet! Every frame is drenched in color, reminiscent of hand-tinted photographs; and the slightly herky-jerky motion is like watching a turn-of-the-century nickelodeon. It's a fascinating use of CGI, one that utilizes cutting-edge techniques to create a deliberately old-fashioned look ... and it's a stylistic success. The acting is somewhat stylized as well, which serves the overall tone & brings the viewer into a perfectly realized world. This isn't the place to look for subtle characterization, or nuanced psychological portraits -- these are fairy tale characters, embodiments of mythic types, and they act as such.But I don't want it to sound too high-falutin'. While the thoughtful viewer can certainly find more below the surface, it's primarily an entertainment, and a dazzling one to boot! It can be enjoyed as pure eye candy, a luscious confection; it has all the thrills & surprises of any good fairy tale; and it teaches something in its own quiet way. You really can't ask for more than that!Accompanied by a lovely, haunting score, this short film will be a welcome addition to your home library.
