And the result is amazingly good, with a wonderful story.Due to contractual issues with Disney (who now own the Kermit likeness) this version has lost the introduction and closing done by Kermit.  But I didn't miss it.And the ""Making Of"" video is excellent, with 2005 interviews with Henson's daughter, Paul Williams the composer, and others, as well as out-takes from the original filming.

Though copyrighted in 1977, their production is a classic now and are family-oriented, which is getting harder and harder to find.As for the movie, the plot is based around a Christmas in Frogtown Hollow with the main characters being Emmet and Ma Otter. Their Christmas gifts are always very plain if not redundant (like, a shirt that had been dyed). They are dirt-poor and have no money for store-bought gifts. Ma Otter does wash, sewing and the like to help the two live day by day and Emmet takes odd jobs to help. Without giving away the movie too much, there is a local talent show coming and there is a $50 cash prize for the winner. Ma Otter sings ""beautifully"" (actually the singer is very good) and Emmet and 3 friends have put together a jub band. Emmet and Ma want to win to buy the other a store-bought Christmas present.The action, characters and situations are very funny for the children and some of us ""young at heart"" adults. I love all of the late Jim Henson's work. The genius of the work he and his staff have to do to get a ""take"" on each scene is sometimes high, i.e., the rolling drum scene. I recommend this movie to kids of all ages. It teaches good morals, hard work and perseverence along with ""good things come to those who wait"". Needless to say, they don't win the contest, but they do win in another way. You and your babies will enjoy it. They have scenes deleted, bloopers (believe it or not) and good interviews with the ones who produced and played parts in it was, for me, very eye-opening into the hows, whys and wherefores of puppetry.

193069,A31ACI0E88ORDE,1586683950,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","********THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS********I don't want to suggest such things lightly, but the storyline here is clearly inspired by ""The Gift of the Magi"", but it makes an improvement.  The premise of ""The Gift of the Magi"" is a good one, but I was less than impressed with the writing of it.  Aside from that not being an issue here, the story here has an added element that I think improves upon the original: here, there is a reason why the two characters were left with less than what they had before.  It's because they were working at odds, because they wanted their gifts to be surprises.That is, because Emmet wanted to surprise his Ma with a new piano, he put a hole in her washtub without her knowledge or permission--rendering her unable to do the laundry that is her livelihood.  And because Ma wanted to surprise Emmet with a new guitar, she sold his late Pa's tool chest without his knowledge or consent--rendering him unable to do the odd jobs that is his livelihood.All along, they should have been working together, as they discover when they put together their two songs and they go together.  And that being the case, this is also an improvement over the book (haven't read it, but you can't listen to a book) in that we can actually hear the songs, and the Paul Williams songs are excellent, as per his usual.  Not only do the songs sound good together, but even with regard to the lyrical content--not only is it the same, but it's precisely about togetherness.  ""Brothers"" ""In Our World"".That's about all I have to say--I'm not much of a purist because I didn't see this when it came out (I wasn't born yet), but as far as I can tell it suffices to tell the story.  In any case, I definitely recommend it.",5,An improvement upon O.
