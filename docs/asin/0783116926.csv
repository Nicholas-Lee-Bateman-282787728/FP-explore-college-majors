44048,AWA79DF9KLF5Y,0783116926,,"[6, 6]","This film has one of the two scariest scenes that I have ever seen. It's so low-key that you will wonder why I thought it scary at all: but the buildup of George C. Scott's character from total unawareness, to unbelief, to total belief is so powerful and non-sensational that the &quot;wet ball rolling down the dark stairs&quot; scene is a heart-stopper: seeing that ball at his feet just about stops poor old George's heart, you can tell; and if you were relating with him, it would just about blast your sanity if it happened to you that way. The whole thing is excellent: a sleeping-murder and ghost story rolled into one. Superb acting all around. Well-crafted plot. Not over-done at all; if anything, under-stated, and that is part of what makes The Changeling work so well.(So what's the other - first or second - most scary scene I have ever seen in a film?

It concerns the death of a little boy back in the early 1900's and to what lengths he will go to to prove the killer's  identity and free his soul.  George C. Scott is a professor of music who's  own brush with tragedy adds to the story's dimension.  I first saw this  movie shortly after it's release and it scared me silly.  To date, every  time I watch this I still get chills and have to eventually turn on some  lights!  This is definately one movie to add to your collection.

44050,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,0783116926,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[2, 4]","This is a very subtle and spooky film that probably suffered from coming out in the middle of the 1980's horror boom when every other film featured attractive teenagers getting chopped to pieces. The result was that it did not do big business at the time of it's release and is not that well known even now, outside of a few very appreciative fans. The action centres on an elderly (for this genre, anyway) man called John Russell, played by George C Scott, who is recovering from the tragedy of losing his wife and child in an accident, and is taking a break in a remote mansion to catch up with some musical teaching and composing. It doesn't take long for him to realise, however, that the house is haunted. But rather than just flee the place, John is drawn into finding out the cause behind the supernatural activity, which leads him to ultimately even put his own life in jeapardy.What's great about this film (well, just one of the great things), is that George C Scott can actually act. Always keeping things on the right side of hysteria, his character leads you through the film, and it's easy to idenitfy with his anguish over the terrible accident that robbed him of his family, which can be read as one of the founding emotions that lead him to become fascinated with the haunting. Scott has to carry much of the film alone, which he manages admirably. It's easy to see that this is an intelligent man, coming face to face with many things that he fears, and yet he refuses to run from them. A refreshing change from the bimbos and ""scream queens""  that are usually plonked in this kind of movie situation. In fact the only female character in the movie is the estate agent that found the house, and she is played by Trish Van DeVere, who thankfully is also a great actress, and she breathes life into what is otherwise a pretty small part.But of course it's the actual haunting that forms the backbone of the film, and I want to credit the filmmakers for the handling of the experience. If I ever find myself in the middle of a supernatural occurence, my expectations are that it would be exactly like this - chilling, frightening and compelling. The seance, when a small, just barely audible voice is captured on tape, is a superb highlight, and the playback of the tape is a masterful sequence of suspense. Better still, the story takes us further than just on a spooky ghost ride, as John gradually uncovers the story behind the ghostly presence, a whole muli-layered back story is revealed, like layers of an onion being peeled away. The explanation for the haunting is poignant and heartbreaking, and the long overdue retribution for the crime that started it all is incredibly satisfying and definitely worth waiting for.All fans of supernatural movies should really own a copy of this film. It is far better than it sounds on paper, and I'm sure it could have been easily bungled in the wrong hands. But thank goodness the director and screen writer knew what they were doing, and with all the right actors and some superb sets and camera work, what they produce is one of the most effective ghost stories on film since ""The Haunting"".",5,One of the best ghost stories on film,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,3156,"['very', 'subtle', 'spooky', 'film', 'probably', 'suffered', 'coming', 'out', 'middle', '1980', 'horror', 'boom', 'when', 'other', 'film', 'featured', 'attractive', 'teenagers', 'getting', 'chopped', 'pieces', 'result', 'was', 'did', 'not', 'do', 'big', 'business', 'time', 'release', 'not', 'that', 'well', 'known', 'even', 'now', 'few', 'very', 'appreciative', 'fans', 'action', 'elderly', 'genre', 'anyway', 'man', 'called', 'John', 'Russell', 'played', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'who', 'recovering', 'tragedy', 'losing', 'wife', 'child', 'accident', 'taking', 'break', 'remote', 'mansion', 'catch', 'up', 'musical', 'teaching', 'composing', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'realise', 'however', 'house', 'haunted', 'rather', 'just', 'flee', 'place', 'John', 'drawn', 'finding', 'out', 'cause', 'supernatural', 'activity', 'ultimately', 'even', 'put', 'own', 'life', 'jeapardy.What', 'great', 'film', 'well', 'just', 'one', 'great', 'things', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'can', 'actually', 'act', 'Always', 'keeping', 'things', 'right', 'side', 'hysteria', 'character', 'film', 'easy', 'idenitfy', 'anguish', 'terrible', 'accident', 'robbed', 'family', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'one', 'founding', 'emotions', 'lead', 'become', 'fascinated', 'haunting', 'Scott', 'carry', 'much', 'film', 'alone', 'admirably', 'easy', 'see', 'intelligent', 'man', 'coming', 'face', 'face', 'many', 'things', 'yet', 'run', 'refreshing', 'change', 'bimbos', 'scream', 'queens', 'are', 'usually', 'plonked', 'kind', 'movie', 'situation', 'fact', 'only', 'female', 'character', 'movie', 'estate', 'agent', 'found', 'house', 'played', 'Trish', 'Van', 'DeVere', 'who', 'thankfully', 'also', 'great', 'actress', 'life', 'what', 'otherwise', 'pretty', 'small', 'part.But', 'course', 'actual', 'haunting', 'backbone', 'film', 'want', 'credit', 'filmmakers', 'handling', 'experience', 'ever', 'find', 'middle', 'supernatural', 'occurence', 'expectations', 'are', 'would', 'be', 'exactly', 'chilling', 'frightening', 'compelling', 'seance', 'when', 'small', 'just', 'barely', 'audible', 'voice', 'captured', 'tape', 'superb', 'highlight', 'playback', 'tape', 'masterful', 'sequence', 'suspense', 'Better', 'still', 'story', 'further', 'just', 'spooky', 'ghost', 'ride', 'John', 'gradually', 'story', 'ghostly', 'presence', 'whole', 'muli-layered', 'back', 'story', 'revealed', 'layers', 'onion', 'being', 'peeled', 'away', 'explanation', 'haunting', 'poignant', 'heartbreaking', 'long', 'overdue', 'retribution', 'crime', 'started', 'incredibly', 'satisfying', 'definitely', 'worth', 'waiting', 'for.All', 'fans', 'supernatural', 'movies', 'should', 'really', 'own', 'copy', 'film', 'far', 'better', 'paper', ""'m"", 'sure', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'bungled', 'wrong', 'hands', 'thank', 'goodness', 'director', 'screen', 'writer', 'knew', 'what', 'were', 'doing', 'right', 'actors', 'superb', 'sets', 'camera', 'work', 'what', 'produce', 'one', 'most', 'effective', 'ghost', 'stories', 'film', 'Haunting']",The Changeling

""Just another cheesy haunted house movie with no thrills"" I was thinking but I was totally wrong. I finally was able to view it years later on HBO and it made every hair on my body stand up! Visually it isn't scary but the symbolisms have a psychological effect on the psyche (e.g. a ball drops down the staircase, George C. Scott picks it up and brings it to a bridge far away and deposits the ball into the water, to his surprise when he arrives back home the same ball drops down from the staricase again). This by far is the best haunted house movie set in a large mansion in the woods outside of Seattle but actually may be in British Columbia. There's something about the Northwest, rain, and classical music that creates the perfect setting for a haunting.A young boy by the name of Joseph Carmichael is robbed of his future empire and murdered by his own father due to his handicap and returns to possess the mansion he once lived in. George C. Scott stars as John Russell, a music professor/composer who recently lost his wife and daughter in a horrible automobile accident and takes residence in the mansion. He forms a bond with the ghostly experiences of the boy and unravels the mysteries of what took place. The mood is eeirly haunting from start to finish, a true classic for the living, the dead, and the undead.",5,"Perfect for a rainy, dark day",1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,1403,"['When', 'CHANGELING', 'first', 'came', 'out', '1979', 'had', 'interest', 'seeing', 'Just', 'cheesy', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'thrills', 'was', 'thinking', 'was', 'totally', 'wrong', 'finally', 'was', 'able', 'view', 'years', 'later', 'HBO', 'made', 'hair', 'body', 'stand', 'up', 'Visually', ""n't"", 'scary', 'symbolisms', 'have', 'psychological', 'effect', 'psyche', 'e.g', 'ball', 'down', 'staircase', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'up', 'bridge', 'far', 'away', 'ball', 'water', 'surprise', 'when', 'back', 'home', 'same', 'ball', 'drops', 'down', 'staricase', 'again', 'far', 'best', 'haunted', 'house', 'movie', 'set', 'large', 'mansion', 'woods', 'Seattle', 'actually', 'may', 'be', 'British', 'Columbia', 'something', 'Northwest', 'rain', 'classical', 'music', 'perfect', 'setting', 'haunting.A', 'young', 'boy', 'name', 'Joseph', 'Carmichael', 'robbed', 'future', 'empire', 'murdered', 'own', 'father', 'due', 'handicap', 'returns', 'possess', 'mansion', 'once', 'lived', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'John', 'Russell', 'music', 'professor/composer', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'wife', 'daughter', 'horrible', 'automobile', 'accident', 'residence', 'mansion', 'bond', 'ghostly', 'experiences', 'boy', 'mysteries', 'what', 'took', 'place', 'mood', 'eeirly', 'haunting', 'start', 'finish', 'true', 'classic', 'living', 'dead', 'undead']",The Changeling
44052,A2AVV9LV9UXT6F,0783116926,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This is one of my favorite horror films of all time.  About the only ones I can think of that I like as well are the original ""Halloween,"" and ""The Shining.""  Those two movies are very different films from each other, and from this film, but all three are characterized by one common theme: what really scares you is what you DON'T see.  Somehow, Hollywood forgot this a long, long time ago.  Your imagination, given a little room to work, can conjure nightmares more vivid and more frightening than anything the best art department and visual effects specialists can ever put on celluloid.  If done well, things only need to be hinted at, and then you will fill in the details out of the scrapbook of horrors that you carry around in your head, and you mind will tailor it to your own deepest fears.Don't get me wrong, visual effects are a true marvel of modern film making, enabling makers of films to achieve effects that their forebears only dreamed of.  Done well and judiciously, this can tremendously enhance a film.  The problem is, these days, almost no one uses this tool judiciously.  It's invariably overdone.  I can't think of a recent ghost story told on the screen where we don't get treated to full, detailed views of the ghost sooner or later.  These days, they always strive to outdo the last film with yet more spectacular stunts, more spectacular effects.  Sometimes it works, but it rarely rises to the level of some of the old films, where the technology was more limited, and this forced them to rely more on the unseen, on suspense, drama, and the talents of the actors and the director.""The Changeling"" is a movie in the old style.  The Ghost is never seen (except, once his identity becomes known, in a flashback to the scene of his murder), but his ominous presence pervades the film almost from the beginning.  Imagine yourself in the place of John Russell, the main character played to perfection by the late, great Geo. C. Scott.  All alone in this huge, old, dark house, and you begin hearing inexplicable noises.  Before long, you realize there is another presence in there with you.  Do this while watching the film alone, at night, in your own dark house.One of the scariest scenes I've ever seen in a movie is the scene where Russell hears the rubber ball his deceased daughter once played with bouncing down the stairs.  It comes to rest just outside the door of the room where he was looking at photos of his lost family.  Knowing the ghost has done this, he drives out to a bridge, and throws the ball in the water, and then arrives back home to find the ball bouncing down the stairs straight toward him as soon as he walks back in the door.  You never see anything except a rubber ball, but it almost makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck.  There are other scenes as well done as this too, and like this scene, all depend on the viewer's imagination, but that's why it works.This is what a ghost story ought to be.",5,Another one of those movies Hollywood forgot how to make,1255737600,"10 17, 2009",2009,2965,"['one', 'favorite', 'horror', 'films', 'time', 'only', 'ones', 'can', 'think', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'are', 'original', 'Halloween', 'Shining', 'two', 'movies', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'other', 'film', 'three', 'are', 'characterized', 'one', 'common', 'theme', 'what', 'really', 'what', 'DO', 'see', 'Somehow', 'Hollywood', 'forgot', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'ago', 'imagination', 'given', 'little', 'room', 'work', 'can', 'conjure', 'nightmares', 'more', 'vivid', 'more', 'frightening', 'anything', 'best', 'art', 'department', 'visual', 'effects', 'specialists', 'can', 'ever', 'put', 'celluloid', 'done', 'well', 'things', 'only', 'need', 'be', 'hinted', 'then', 'will', 'fill', 'details', 'scrapbook', 'horrors', 'carry', 'around', 'head', 'mind', 'will', 'tailor', 'own', 'deepest', 'fears.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'visual', 'effects', 'are', 'true', 'marvel', 'modern', 'film', 'making', 'enabling', 'makers', 'films', 'achieve', 'effects', 'forebears', 'only', 'dreamed', 'Done', 'well', 'judiciously', 'can', 'tremendously', 'enhance', 'film', 'problem', 'days', 'almost', 'one', 'tool', 'judiciously', 'invariably', 'overdone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'recent', 'ghost', 'story', 'told', 'screen', 'where', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'treated', 'full', 'detailed', 'views', 'ghost', 'sooner', 'later', 'days', 'always', 'strive', 'outdo', 'last', 'film', 'yet', 'more', 'spectacular', 'stunts', 'more', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'rarely', 'level', 'old', 'films', 'where', 'technology', 'was', 'more', 'limited', 'forced', 'rely', 'more', 'unseen', 'suspense', 'drama', 'talents', 'actors', 'director', 'Changeling', 'movie', 'old', 'style', 'Ghost', 'never', 'seen', 'once', 'identity', 'known', 'flashback', 'scene', 'murder', 'ominous', 'presence', 'film', 'almost', 'beginning', 'Imagine', 'place', 'John', 'Russell', 'main', 'character', 'played', 'perfection', 'late', 'great', 'Geo', 'C.', 'Scott', 'alone', 'huge', 'old', 'dark', 'house', 'begin', 'hearing', 'inexplicable', 'noises', 'long', 'realize', 'presence', 'Do', 'while', 'watching', 'film', 'alone', 'night', 'own', 'dark', 'house.One', 'scariest', 'scenes', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'scene', 'where', 'Russell', 'rubber', 'ball', 'deceased', 'daughter', 'once', 'played', 'bouncing', 'down', 'stairs', 'rest', 'just', 'door', 'room', 'where', 'was', 'looking', 'photos', 'lost', 'family', 'Knowing', 'ghost', 'done', 'out', 'bridge', 'ball', 'water', 'then', 'back', 'home', 'find', 'ball', 'bouncing', 'down', 'stairs', 'straight', 'as', 'soon', 'back', 'door', 'never', 'see', 'anything', 'rubber', 'ball', 'almost', 'hair', 'stand', 'up', 'back', 'neck', 'are', 'other', 'scenes', 'well', 'done', 'too', 'scene', 'depend', 'viewer', 'imagination', 'why', 'what', 'ghost', 'story', 'ought', 'be']",The Changeling

THE CHANGELING is probably the best haunted house movie since the original version of THE HAUNTING. It's chilling and intense, but without much overt violence, bloodiness, or special effects overkill. My only disagreement with Wright is when he calls THE CHANGELING a &quot;horror&quot; film. A horror film, by contemporary standards, it is NOT (if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere). Sublety is the order of the day, and it works very well. George C. Scott gives a nice performance in the lead role.My problem with this movie is how to rate it. It doesn't quite have the classic production features of THE UNINVITED and it isn't going to be found on any &quot;top 100 movie&quot; lists, so it's hard for me to give it five stars. On the other hand, I really like THE CHANGELING. Like THE HAUNTING, it's creepy without bludgeoning you with hordes of computer-animated ghosts running up and down the stairs. It gives you something wierd and lets your imagination do the rest. I've decided to be a bit conservative here. I'm only giving THE CHANGELING four stars. It's a strong four stars, thought. This is a great flick for Halloween, or for any dark and stormy night. If you're looking for a good haunted house movie, they don't get much better than this.

It is a ghost story.  An extremely well done ghost story, that got little fanfare when it was released, but is far superior to much of the hyped fare then and since.  With a solid cast, led by George C. Scott, the film manages its thrills and chills by technique, i.e., by the adroit use of sound and image, and a carefully crafted buildup of tension.  A good story that overcomes any gaps in its internal logic by good acting and skillful direction and production, The Changeling is well worth a look; however, slash and gore lovers need to look elsewhere.",4,Superior Ghost Story.,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,919,"['Spine-chilling', 'needed', 'definition', 'word', 'Changeling', 'would', 'do', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'times', 'couple', 'scenes', 'send', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'nonetheless', 'ghost', 'story/murder', 'mystery', 'combined', 'Changeling', 'old-fashioned', 'supernatural', 'tale', 'eschewing', 'blood', 'amp', 'guts', 'atmosphere', 'amp', 'NOT', 'horror', 'movie', 'ghost', 'story', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'ghost', 'story', 'got', 'little', 'fanfare', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'far', 'superior', 'much', 'hyped', 'fare', 'then', 'solid', 'cast', 'led', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'film', 'thrills', 'chills', 'technique', 'i.e.', 'adroit', 'use', 'sound', 'image', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'buildup', 'tension', 'good', 'story', 'gaps', 'internal', 'logic', 'good', 'acting', 'skillful', 'direction', 'production', 'Changeling', 'well', 'look', 'however', 'slash', 'gore', 'lovers', 'need', 'look', 'elsewhere']",The Changeling

There was never a letdown for a minute, and it is a lot of fun to watch The Changeling. Obviously, The Changeling is a so much better picture than The Amityville Horror, Boogeyman, Darkness Falls, or any of the other similar crap. At a first glance, I thought The Changeling might be some typical, oft-abused haunted horror story that would generate very little or zero interest from me, but it turned out that the story itself was much different and at the same time very exciting. About the end of the picture, I felt a realization that The Ring is perhaps too akin to The Changeling, so I am suspect of the former being a copy of the latter. I'll like to find that out later when I get the chance to see The Ring. George C. Scott, to my surprise, is excellent in The Changeling. The way he acts, that's very good stuff. Meanwhile, I was impressed with the makers of The Changeling because they didn't rely too much on special effects which are rampantly used in today's movies in order to score points with the audience. One interesting thing about The Changeling is how the house communicates with the characters not in an abnormal way but rather in a human form. It's fantastic stuff. I found The Changeling a more effective picture than Poltergeist, and the comparisons between both of them are plenty. But The Changeling wins out just about in everything. All in all, The Changeling is a superbly mastered suspenseful horror mystery.",5,Thoroughly Excellent.,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",2010,1562,"['Viewed', '8/06Rate', '98/06', 'What', 'great', 'picture', 'Changeling', 'full', 'suspense', 'great', 'mystery', 'story', 'was', 'never', 'letdown', 'minute', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'Changeling', 'Obviously', 'Changeling', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'picture', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'Boogeyman', 'Darkness', 'Falls', 'other', 'similar', 'crap', 'first', 'glance', 'thought', 'Changeling', 'might', 'be', 'typical', 'oft-abused', 'haunted', 'horror', 'story', 'would', 'generate', 'very', 'little', 'zero', 'interest', 'turned', 'out', 'story', 'was', 'much', 'different', 'same', 'time', 'very', 'exciting', 'end', 'picture', 'felt', 'realization', 'Ring', 'perhaps', 'too', 'akin', 'Changeling', 'am', 'suspect', 'former', 'being', 'copy', 'latter', ""'ll"", 'like', 'find', 'out', 'later', 'when', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'Ring', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'surprise', 'excellent', 'Changeling', 'way', 'very', 'good', 'stuff', 'Meanwhile', 'was', 'impressed', 'makers', 'Changeling', 'did', ""n't"", 'rely', 'too', 'much', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'rampantly', 'used', 'today', 'movies', 'order', 'score', 'points', 'audience', 'One', 'interesting', 'thing', 'Changeling', 'how', 'house', 'characters', 'not', 'abnormal', 'way', 'rather', 'human', 'form', 'fantastic', 'stuff', 'found', 'Changeling', 'more', 'effective', 'picture', 'Poltergeist', 'comparisons', 'are', 'plenty', 'Changeling', 'out', 'just', 'everything', 'Changeling', 'superbly', 'mastered', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'mystery']",The Changeling

44073,A1PPIFR51T81IK,0783116926,Buster49,"[8, 8]","""The Changeling"" is, to me, what great ghost stories should be. In the tradition of ""The Uninvited"" and the 1963 ""The Haunting,"" it creates a mood, an atmosphere of tension and terror. Films like this work not only at this level but they also provide a mystery behind why the ghost haunts.I'm sorry but Freddy and Jason are hacker movies that totally dispense with this sort of atmosphere. Even the Amityville horror series and Speilberg's ""Poltergeist"" fall significantly short of this type of film. These latter named films look for ways to create scenes for the sole purpose of suddenly yelling ""boo"" even if they have a story behind the hauntings. The fear created in movies like ""The Changeling"" comes about by bringing the viewer to a place arrived at through the slowly unfolding mystery behind the haunting and then presenting a scene, of interaction with the spirit which is the result of building upon the previous scenes. In other words, the haunting moment comes about by something in the story that calls for it to be there. There's no ""let's have a scary moment to remind everyone that this is a ghost story."" Each bit of information and its haunting moments continues until the journey's end when the mystery is revealed. The linear approach in these scripts suggests the straightforward reading of classic novels. It takes patience with great rewards if we stay with it. They don't resort to the sudden bursts of ""boo"" for its own sake in order to hold our attention. I highly recommend ""The Changeling"" as there are relatively few of this type of filmed ghost story.",5,Classic Ghost Tale,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1583,"['Changeling', 'what', 'great', 'ghost', 'stories', 'should', 'be', 'tradition', 'Uninvited', '1963', 'Haunting', 'mood', 'atmosphere', 'tension', 'terror', 'Films', 'work', 'not', 'only', 'level', 'also', 'provide', 'mystery', 'why', 'ghost', 'haunts.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'Freddy', 'Jason', 'are', 'hacker', 'movies', 'totally', 'sort', 'atmosphere', 'Even', 'Amityville', 'horror', 'series', 'Speilberg', 'Poltergeist', 'fall', 'significantly', 'short', 'type', 'film', 'latter', 'named', 'films', 'look', 'ways', 'create', 'scenes', 'sole', 'purpose', 'suddenly', 'yelling', 'boo', 'even', 'have', 'story', 'hauntings', 'fear', 'created', 'movies', 'Changeling', 'about', 'bringing', 'viewer', 'place', 'arrived', 'slowly', 'unfolding', 'mystery', 'haunting', 'then', 'presenting', 'scene', 'interaction', 'spirit', 'result', 'building', 'previous', 'scenes', 'other', 'words', 'haunting', 'moment', 'something', 'story', 'be', 'there', 'let', 'have', 'scary', 'moment', 'remind', 'everyone', 'ghost', 'story', 'bit', 'information', 'haunting', 'moments', 'journey', 'end', 'when', 'mystery', 'revealed', 'linear', 'approach', 'scripts', 'straightforward', 'reading', 'classic', 'novels', 'patience', 'great', 'rewards', 'stay', 'do', ""n't"", 'resort', 'sudden', 'bursts', 'boo', 'own', 'sake', 'order', 'hold', 'attention', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Changeling', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'type', 'filmed', 'ghost', 'story']",The Changeling

Scott uses all means possible to find out more including a seance. His investigation leads him to a powerful foe. The movie has great atmosphere and subtlety that makes it different than the current bleeders.  The directing and camera work are excellent.

I'm a big scary movie fan, and this one is one of my all time favorites. Although the ending I have always felt does not do it justice.A music professor has a family tragedy and moves to another state to start over. There he rents a house, that could easily fit the whole Van Trapp family. What he doesn't know and soon finds out is that there is something lurking in this house, something waiting patiently for someone damaged enough and lonely enough to summon on a quest, if you will, that will bring darkness into light.I don't believe I should say much of the plot, I find that there are quite a few that have already said a bit too much. I will say though that the movie pulls you in, in the way a good fright night movie should, lots of eery music, strange camera angles, long flights of stairs that end in shadows, and that damn ball ; )All these things really increase the scary factor and goose bumps will follow. Now if you're looking for a lot of special effects and gore this is not the movie for you. This is a haunted house movie and as with most haunted house movies, ghosts are the prevalent ""monster"" here.

The haunting is believable and coherent--the story behind the death of the child now prowling the mansion as a ghost is touching, terrible, and truly frightening. The way that the ghost makes himself known is consistent with his life and his death. Everything hangs together in a strong narrative that drives forward unnervingly; the terrible answer to this puzzle is cohesive and believable.In fact, Changeling has almost all the element to create the prototypical ghost story. It opens with a tragedy that makes the one survivor ""open"" to the other side through his grief. It takes place largely in a slight decrepit old house, a house that is bound to have history, good and bad. Russell is intelligent and artistic, driven to track dowm a seemingly meaningless banging of pipes, which is later revealed as central to the ghost's communication. The ghost is looking for resolution, and cannot rest, tormented until the answer to his death is found; just a boy, he cannot imagine why something so awful had been done to him.Changeling is also a wonderfully quiet movie. The story pushes on relentlessly, but without spectacular effects or a single ""action"" scene; action in this movie is a scene involving a psychic engaged in automatic writing. It is the wanting answers and wanting the ghost to find release that drives the movie, not noise and special effects.This is a perfect addition to any rainy afternoon creepfest, preferablyAutumn or Winter.",5,A perfect ghost story for a rainy Autumn day,1285632000,"09 28, 2010",2010,1544,"['Changeling', 'perfect', 'choice', ""'re"", 'mood', 'creepy', 'classic', 'ghost', 'story', 'haunting', 'believable', 'coherent', 'story', 'death', 'child', 'now', 'prowling', 'mansion', 'ghost', 'touching', 'terrible', 'truly', 'frightening', 'way', 'ghost', 'known', 'consistent', 'life', 'death', 'Everything', 'together', 'strong', 'narrative', 'forward', 'unnervingly', 'terrible', 'answer', 'puzzle', 'cohesive', 'believable.In', 'fact', 'Changeling', 'almost', 'element', 'create', 'prototypical', 'ghost', 'story', 'tragedy', 'one', 'survivor', 'open', 'other', 'side', 'grief', 'place', 'largely', 'slight', 'decrepit', 'old', 'house', 'house', 'bound', 'have', 'history', 'good', 'bad', 'Russell', 'intelligent', 'artistic', 'driven', 'track', 'dowm', 'seemingly', 'meaningless', 'banging', 'pipes', 'later', 'revealed', 'central', 'ghost', 'communication', 'ghost', 'looking', 'resolution', 'can', 'not', 'rest', 'tormented', 'answer', 'death', 'found', 'just', 'boy', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'why', 'something', 'so', 'awful', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'him.Changeling', 'also', 'wonderfully', 'quiet', 'movie', 'story', 'pushes', 'relentlessly', 'spectacular', 'effects', 'single', 'action', 'scene', 'action', 'movie', 'scene', 'involving', 'psychic', 'engaged', 'automatic', 'writing', 'wanting', 'answers', 'wanting', 'ghost', 'find', 'release', 'movie', 'not', 'noise', 'special', 'effects.This', 'perfect', 'addition', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'creepfest', 'preferablyAutumn', 'Winter']",The Changeling

Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[0, 1]","I doubt I will be the last person in history to praise the enjoyable creepiness of ""The Changeling,"" the near-peerless haunted house thriller that slithered out of Canada in 1980. To this day, I still have a difficult time watching this film alone. I can recall viewing this flick with a girlfriend on a dark and stormy Halloween night. About halfway in, she literally left the room crying, asking me to turn on the light.I think the mood is extremely important to ""The Changeling."" The opening tragedy that befalls the protagonist's family is about as terrifying a prologue as ever seen in film. The Canadian locale (I believe this was filmed in the Vancouver area) is dark and overcast, with an old house that looks about as far from a Hollywood backlot as any house could possibly be. The extraordinary cast, including Academy Award winners George C. Scott and Melvyn Douglas, also lend a respectable air to the eerie proceedings. Frankly, this is good old-fashioned horror that proves the great axiom - `Less is more.' You will find no gateway's to hell or murdering witches or serial killers in ""The Changeling."" Just a ghost - the ghost of a murdered child.Scott plays a grief-stricken musician who moves into an old dark house, working as a professor at the nearby university. He eventually begins hearing weird sounds in his dusty abode and, after a bit of investigation, discovers a hidden room in the attic - a hidden room with a wheelchair. Scott begins to research the house's history, eventually discovering a dark secret stretching all the way to the local Senator (Douglas, of course). And did I say there was the ghost of a murdered child? Not wanting to give away the scares, let's just say vignettes involving the wheelchair and a rubber ball are some of the spookiest scenes ever filmed. And, of course, there's the seance.British director Peter Medak (having done ""The Ruling Class"" previously) has done a superb job in building the tension of this film. Camera angles peering around corners, leering from above and rapidly moving up the stairs towards dark, hidden rooms, cause the proceedings to be almost unbearable. And of course, you have George C. Scott, an actor who never really gave a bad performance in a film. ""The Changeling"" is no exception. One of the greatest American actors of all time, Scott is matching wits with an extremely indignant ghost.

Thinking it would be a nice, secluded place to compose his music, he soon learns that he is not alone in the house when a loud, residual-like banging resounds at the same time every day (which is later explained). Curious, he goes about exploring and discovers a locked, hidden door. Eventually getting it open he unravels clues to a young boy's past and gets caught up in searching for answers as to why this spirit is not at peace.I found THE CHANGELING (1980) to be a gripping haunted house/ghost story for the ages. They don't make horror films like this too often; ones that rely more on good storytelling and chilling atmosphere rather than gore and violence, so I found this movie to be refreshingly entertaining.

He moves to Seattle and leases a huge, long-empty gothic mansion where he plans to concentrate on his music and to avoid people. But strange things begin to happen. Late at night, half asleep, he hears deep, echoing bangs in the house. A door opens without apparent cause. He can hear at times what sounds like indecipherable whispering. He sees in a haze a child's face staring up at him from a pool of water. Standing outside the house one morning he hears a window break. He looks up at the house and sees way at the very top, under the eaves, a smashed window. He goes in to investigate and finds at the top a stairway leading to a closet, but with the closet serving to wall off a forgotten room full of cobwebs, dust, jumbled furniture, a bathing tub, toys two generations old, a music box that still plays and a small, wooden wheelchair. With help of a woman from the historical society, Claire Norman (Trish Van Devere), he starts to track the history of the house, reaching as far back as the turn of the century. What he finds is unsettling. Whatever is in the house appears to be pointing Russell to what might have been the murder of a small boy. In some way, this seems to be connected to a very powerful, very rich and very respected old man, Senator Joseph Carmichael (Melvyn Douglas).This is one of those movies I like a lot for the first two-thirds but which I wind up wishing it had been better. The movie is eery and understated, with a sad quality to it that keeps building. Scott nails his character's sense of loss and his slowly gaining interest in something he can't explain. Douglas, at 79 and in one of his last roles, plays Carmichael as powerful but conflicted. I can't think of a role Douglas ever played in a long career in which he failed to deliver a first-rate performance, and he does so again here.For me, the movie has two aspects that leave me a bit disappointed. First, the person who suffers the most from what Russell discovers is not, in my view, really guilty of anything. The villain of the story is long dead, and it is difficult to feel that retribution is either deserved or just. The other aspect is that particularly in the last third of the movie, special affects begin to take over which seem to have no purpose except to startle or make you expect the worst. The ending in particular when Claire Norman is threatened and John Russell barely makes it out of the burning house seem tacked on. On a smaller note, I wish that there had been more chemistry between John Russell and Claire Norman. There's not much indication that things for them are going to move beyond them becoming just good friends.However, I've always liked the story. I like the style and look of the film. I like the atmosphere that something inevitably sad, not just scary, is happening.

44103,A1KTSCNH90LPIP,0783116926,"D. Smithee ""Universal Daddy""","[4, 7]","The trip down memory lane continues with my recent purchase of The Changeling DVD. It was one of the first horror movies I say. While considered a horror movie, this is movie is more downright creepy than horrific.This George C. Scott, Trish VanDevere, Melvyn Douglas vehicle is well produced and well acted, depending on story rather than effects, which there are virtually none. It is a combination haunted house/ghost story/murder mystery that evokes a feeling of terror without any gore.In summary, Scott plays a composer who loses his wife and daughter in a traffic accident in the first scene. He moves into a huge historic mansion where a murder was committed around the turn of the century. VanDevere works for the historic society that rents him this expansive manse that bangs and rumbles mysteriously making sure Scott gets up in time to teach his classes. After discovering a secret room behind a closet (shades of Rosemary's Baby?) he investigates the nasty things that happened in this personable house's past. It's takes a seance to find all the missing pieces as the ghost tells the story of his murder by his father. Seems daddy like money more than his son and would loose it if the sickly stripling kicked it before he turned 21. Daddy disposes of the inferior model and acquires a healthier one through the local orphangae. (Thus the changeling.)The spirit is well portrayed almost exclusively through the plot. It's only physical manifestations are as a dead body floating in a bathtub. At times it's lonely, other times it's pissed off, and when it seems that things are gonna fall apart, it's downright malevolent, knocking off a police captain that threatens to put the kibosh on Scott's machinations to expose this whole torrid affair. Just like a six year old boy.The film suffers less as a fashion victim than Scott's film of the previous year, Hardcore. Hey, it was the seventies. We all had those wide lapels. Unfortunately, the ending is muddled and the now senator changeling appears to try and make peace with terror tantrum ghost boy who is tearing down the house by this point. Senator changeling then drops dead of a heart attack. Or did he kick it first. It's not too clear. Aside from this, it's a great movie.The DVD has a crisp picture with the slightly washed out color you'd expect of a seventies movie and the sound is clear. The only special features are some cast and crew bios.What's the creepiest scene?

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[13, 14]","One of the supposed reasons why ghosts remain in this world is that they were murdered, and want the world to know who did it.So expect a lot of that in ""The Changeling,"" a quiet, compelling ghost story that harkens back to old-fashioned chillers. No ghouls, buckets of blood, chainsaws or serial killers. Instead, this movie relies on outstanding acting, and a timeless feeling that permeates the simple story. And it'll scare the skin off you.John Russell (George C. Scott) is on a trip with his wife and daughter, when a freak car accident kills them both. Months later, the grieving composer moves to Seattle and rents an enormous historical house, trying to bury himself in his new job. But there are odd sounds and sights in his house -- faucets running, eerie voices the piano clashing, and a boy drowned in the tub.John becomes increasingly desperate to find out the truth, assisted by the real estate agent who got him the house (Trish Van Devere). With seances, visions and a well under the floorboards, he begins to piece together a terrible crime from many years ago -- and the ""changeling"" that the ghost wants revenge on.Anyone who wants blood, special effects and lots of screaming had better look elsewhere for their horror kicks. ""The Changeling"" is a very different kind of movie -- think Shirley Jackson, not Stephen King -- where a wheelchair rattling down the stairs is enough to make your hair stand on end. (And do I detect some influence on ""The Ring"" in certain scenes?)This movie also feels elegant and timeless. Old mossy mansions, horseback riding in damp forests, and a composer trying to overcome his grief. Peter Medak drapes the movie in beautiful visuals, and allows the viewers to get to know the characters before the plot really gets moving.Then ""The Changeling"" becomes creepy very fast. The plot grows more suspenseful with every scene, building with every new discovery -- a wheelchair, a baptismal medal, and a bathtub -- until something has to erupt. The ghost never appears except in flashbacks -- an appalling murder scene -- but his keening voice can be heard over and over.George C. Scott gives a pitch-perfect performance as the mild, slightly reclusive John, who is still suffering from his losses and trying to move on with his life. Van Devere comes across as a bit annoying at first, but she also serves as a good counterpoint to Scott, as well as a potential love interest whenever he's ready. Melvyn Douglas also has a good brief role as a politician with a deep dark secret.Less is more in ""The Changeling,"" a movie whose scares spring from its exceptional scripting, eerie ghost and great acting.

Scott plays a composer who, having just lost his wife and daughter, moves into a very atmospheric old house in New England to get some serious writing done.

But what is it the boy is trying to tell him?There are scenes in this film that never cease to make my hair stand on end, no matter how many times I have seen the film (and that's alot of times...). The scene with the ball which belonged to Scott's daughter which wont go away, the chair at the top of the stairs, the ghostly voice superimposed on the tape recording of the seance, the chase through the attic... my skin crawls even now.One can empathise with the rage of the spirit of a child, crippled and confined to a wheelchair in life, and his desperation and frustration when he tries repeatedly to convey a message which Scott, though all ears, continues to fail in understanding.

The Changeling isn't a masterpiece, but its a dam fine ghost story and a very good horror film.  With a very good performance from George C. Scott, who draws you in to the film and keeps you watching.Unlike most horror films where nearly every scene is packed with cheap scares and jumpy parts where a monster or a guy with a knife pops out and terrifies the thick as s*#! teenager, the Changeling has eerie moments and some really creepy scenes that work really well.  The story is very engaging, pulling you in as George C. Scott finds clues and investigates the sounds of banging and child-like laughter in his newly purchased old mansion.  What I really like about this film, is that there are a couple scenes that ACTUALLY gave me the chills.  There are rarely any horror films that actually scare me, and to be honest, i'd like a horror film that would.

44119,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,0783116926,"HorrorMan ""HM""","[3, 3]","Many years ago, I can remember seeing ""The Changeling"" on HBO when I was a child.  It scared the daylights out of me.  After viewing it a couple of times since then, I can understand why.  ""The Changeling"" is a brilliant little suspense-filled ghost story that provides quite a mystery to the audience and keeps the audience hooked from the opening scene.Piece by piece, our protagonist, John (played brilliantly by the great George C. Scott), is able to put things together.  ""The Changeling"" is not scary because of violence or blood and gore, but because of the eerie atmosphere and building tension it employs throughout the movie that causes the viewer to become scared by being drawn into the dark and mysterious world of the supernatural.  Is it the scariest movie of all-time?  Certainly not, but it is without a doubt quite creepy, and some of the images can really get under your skin.""The Changeling"" is about a music composer named John who loses his family in a tragic accident which the viewer sees early in the movie.  John attempts to put his life back together by moving to Seattle into a huge home that would seem to be ideal for his love of music.  However, strange things begin to happen at the house early on, and the fact that the house is haunted by a tormented spirit becomes obvious as the movie progresses.  The fact that the house is so old and huge only accentuates the horror associated with the haunting.  As the movie develops, the audience witnesses more overt acts of the supernatural along with John.When John is convinced of a ghost being present in the house (after a spooky scene with a mediator which was very well done I might add), the mystery of the movie begins to unfold.  Why is this spirit not at rest?  Why is this spirit tormenting John?  What does the spirit want??  These questions are answered as the movie progresses in a haunting little tale known cleverly as ""The Changeling"".  Some of the scenes in this movie are quite scary, and the viewer becomes mesmerized by the mystery and suspense of this ghost story.  Some of the scariest scenes involve the scene with the well, the scene with the ball, and the scenes in the upstairs room in the old haunted house.What makes ""The Changeling"" so good as it does a brilliant job of allowing the viewer to buy into the story, to make a believer out of the viewer in the ghost story and the haunted house itself.  The scares start out subtley enough, but the manifestations become more direct as the movie progresses and in a very convincing way, not over-the-top or cheesey (if you will) ways a la movies like the remake of ""The Haunting"".  The design of ""The Changeling"" is very well done and allows the viewer to feel the chilling aspects of the haunting in a very climactic manner and with classic cinematic structure which really works to give the movie a big boost in its attempt to captivate and scare the audience.The acting and direction in this movie are second to none, especially George C. Scott, who never ceases to amaze me with how great of an actor he really is.  The mystery of ""The Changeling"" is almost as compelling as the haunting of the old house by the spirit, and it is the motive behind the ghost's actions that really drive the movie, but is the ghost a benevolent or malevolent entity??  The answer to this question is not always clear throughout the movie, a bit on the vauge side at least for most of the movie.  Perhaps this is not the most menacing ghost of all-time or a strictly evil spirit, but it is a selfish spirit and it doesn't mind killing someone along the way to get what it wants.  Hence, this is also part of the charm of ""The Changeling"" and allows the viewer to become even more captivated by the unpredictability of the spirit's nature.I highly recommend this movie to any horror movie lover (although to classify this movie strictly as horror movie would be to misclassify it as it is clearly a horror-mystery hybrid), especially those that love haunted house and/or ghost story movies as ""The Changeling"" is without a doubt one of the very best of its kind.",4,A spooky good ghost story!,1187395200,"08 18, 2007",2007,4100,"['Many', 'years', 'ago', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Changeling', 'HBO', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'scared', 'daylights', 'viewing', 'couple', 'times', 'then', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'Changeling', 'brilliant', 'little', 'suspense-filled', 'ghost', 'story', 'quite', 'mystery', 'audience', 'audience', 'hooked', 'opening', 'scene.Piece', 'piece', 'protagonist', 'John', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'great', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'able', 'put', 'things', 'together', 'Changeling', 'not', 'scary', 'violence', 'blood', 'gore', 'eerie', 'atmosphere', 'building', 'tension', 'movie', 'viewer', 'become', 'scared', 'being', 'drawn', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'world', 'supernatural', 'scariest', 'movie', 'all-time', 'Certainly', 'not', 'doubt', 'quite', 'creepy', 'images', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'skin', 'Changeling', 'music', 'composer', 'named', 'John', 'who', 'family', 'tragic', 'accident', 'viewer', 'early', 'movie', 'John', 'put', 'life', 'back', 'together', 'moving', 'Seattle', 'huge', 'home', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'ideal', 'love', 'music', 'However', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'house', 'early', 'fact', 'house', 'haunted', 'tormented', 'spirit', 'obvious', 'movie', 'fact', 'house', 'so', 'old', 'huge', 'only', 'horror', 'associated', 'haunting', 'movie', 'audience', 'more', 'overt', 'acts', 'supernatural', 'John.When', 'John', 'convinced', 'ghost', 'being', 'present', 'house', 'spooky', 'scene', 'mediator', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'might', 'add', 'mystery', 'movie', 'unfold', 'Why', 'spirit', 'not', 'rest', 'Why', 'spirit', 'tormenting', 'John', 'What', 'spirit', 'want', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'movie', 'haunting', 'little', 'tale', 'known', 'cleverly', 'Changeling', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'quite', 'scary', 'viewer', 'mesmerized', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'ghost', 'story', 'scariest', 'scenes', 'involve', 'scene', 'well', 'scene', 'ball', 'scenes', 'upstairs', 'room', 'old', 'haunted', 'house.What', 'Changeling', 'so', 'good', 'brilliant', 'job', 'allowing', 'viewer', 'buy', 'story', 'make', 'believer', 'viewer', 'ghost', 'story', 'haunted', 'house', 'scares', 'start', 'out', 'subtley', 'enough', 'manifestations', 'become', 'more', 'direct', 'movie', 'very', 'convincing', 'way', 'not', 'over-the-top', 'cheesey', 'will', 'ways', 'la', 'movies', 'remake', 'Haunting', 'design', 'Changeling', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'viewer', 'feel', 'chilling', 'aspects', 'haunting', 'very', 'climactic', 'manner', 'classic', 'cinematic', 'structure', 'really', 'give', 'movie', 'big', 'boost', 'attempt', 'captivate', 'scare', 'audience.The', 'acting', 'direction', 'movie', 'are', 'second', 'none', 'especially', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'who', 'never', 'amaze', 'how', 'great', 'actor', 'really', 'mystery', 'Changeling', 'almost', 'as', 'compelling', 'haunting', 'old', 'house', 'spirit', 'motive', 'ghost', 'actions', 'really', 'drive', 'movie', 'ghost', 'benevolent', 'malevolent', 'entity', 'answer', 'question', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'movie', 'bit', 'vauge', 'side', 'least', 'most', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'most', 'menacing', 'ghost', 'all-time', 'strictly', 'evil', 'spirit', 'selfish', 'spirit', ""n't"", 'mind', 'killing', 'someone', 'way', 'get', 'what', 'Hence', 'also', 'part', 'charm', 'Changeling', 'viewer', 'become', 'even', 'more', 'captivated', 'unpredictability', 'spirit', 'nature.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'horror', 'movie', 'lover', 'classify', 'movie', 'strictly', 'horror', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'misclassify', 'clearly', 'horror-mystery', 'hybrid', 'especially', 'love', 'haunted', 'house', 'ghost', 'story', 'movies', 'Changeling', 'doubt', 'one', 'very', 'best', 'kind']",The Changeling

Unfortunately, the film is virtually forgotten and rarely referenced outside of aficionados who always give this film rave reviews. However, this film is good enough to work well outside of the realms of Horror fandom to rank as good film-making in general.The film tells the story of a man(George C. Scott) who is recovering from the loss of his wife and daughter by moving into an old house by himself. Soon upon arriving he is beset by ghostly sounds and occurences that get increasingly more eerie as the film progresses. He eventually discovers a hidden room within the house that contains a terrible secret and thus begins a fine mystery where the audience is as much the detective as Scott is.""The Changeling"" benefits largely from an intelligent and thought provoking script that is both emotional as it is terrifying, as complex as it is intriguing. There are twists for sure but they are carefully built and the pay off is something else.The acting is uniformly fine by a cast of professionals led by Scott, Trish Van Devere(Mrs. Scott in real life"")as a woman that aids Scott in the mystery and Melvyn Douglas in one of his last roles as a politician with a shady past.(Douglas' film debut was a horror film:James Whale's ""The Old Dark House(1932)"")Medak really handles the film's scares adequately focusing more on the power of suggestion that more visceral terror and the movie becomes that much more terrifying because of that choice. Not that all scares are within the mind as the film has some excellently concieved jump scares and a particularly exciting climax.The seance segment is in particular a classic Horror scene not to be missed!The film is a must for the Horror fan and for anyone who enjoys a good mystery and a decent scare.

44130,A106016KSI0YQ,0783116926,Jay Dickson,"[2, 3]","Made in a period when most horror films were of the slasher and blood-and-guts variety, THE CHANGELING dramatizes that the best scares come from unsettling understatement rather than from easy gory shocks. George C. Scott stars as a wealthy composer whose wife and daughter have died in a sudden horrifying incident; he moves from New York to a large abandoned historic mansion in Seattle to work and recuperate from his losses. As time passes, he becomes aware of a presence within the house that seems to settle in a hidden attic room.While not quite in the highest echelon of haunted house films (such as THE HAUNTING and THE INNOCENTS) due to a needless Watergate-inspired conspiracy subplot and the silly De Palmaesque sequence relating the deaths Scott's wife and daughter near the beginning of the film, THE CHANGELING is certainly close to that high level. There are several classically creepy sequences, including the playback sequence, the dripping water sequence, and the scene of the young girl and the vision under her bedroom, that showcase what magnificent film editing (and sound editing) can do. The very best of these is the famous seance, probably the best ever filmed: the quickening tempo of the editing, the medium's creepy lack of affect as she intones her questions to the dead child, and the eerie sounds of her automatic writing scratching against the page (punctuated by her husband's one-word readings of the messages the child leaves) leaves a very haunting effect after the film is over. An interesting sidenote: clearly Stephen King borrowed heavily for this film for his 2002 miniseries ROSE RED, which lifts many details (the aforementioned automatic writing sequence, the Seattle setting for the haunted house, and the visual imagery of the tower room and the staircase leading up to it) wholesale from THE CHANGELING.",4,"""HELP, HELP, JOHN, HELP""",1017360000,"03 29, 2002",2002,1852,"['Made', 'period', 'when', 'most', 'horror', 'films', 'were', 'slasher', 'blood-and-guts', 'variety', 'THE', 'CHANGELING', 'best', 'scares', 'come', 'unsettling', 'understatement', 'rather', 'easy', 'gory', 'shocks', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'wealthy', 'composer', 'wife', 'daughter', 'have', 'died', 'sudden', 'horrifying', 'incident', 'New', 'York', 'large', 'abandoned', 'historic', 'mansion', 'Seattle', 'work', 'recuperate', 'losses', 'time', 'passes', 'aware', 'presence', 'house', 'settle', 'hidden', 'attic', 'room.While', 'not', 'quite', 'highest', 'echelon', 'haunted', 'house', 'films', 'such', 'THE', 'HAUNTING', 'THE', 'INNOCENTS', 'due', 'needless', 'Watergate-inspired', 'conspiracy', 'subplot', 'silly', 'De', 'Palmaesque', 'sequence', 'relating', 'deaths', 'Scott', 'wife', 'daughter', 'beginning', 'film', 'CHANGELING', 'certainly', 'close', 'high', 'level', 'are', 'several', 'classically', 'creepy', 'sequences', 'including', 'playback', 'sequence', 'dripping', 'water', 'sequence', 'scene', 'young', 'girl', 'vision', 'bedroom', 'showcase', 'what', 'magnificent', 'film', 'editing', 'sound', 'editing', 'can', 'do', 'very', 'best', 'famous', 'seance', 'probably', 'best', 'ever', 'filmed', 'quickening', 'tempo', 'editing', 'medium', 'creepy', 'lack', 'affect', 'questions', 'dead', 'child', 'eerie', 'sounds', 'automatic', 'writing', 'scratching', 'page', 'punctuated', 'husband', 'one-word', 'readings', 'messages', 'child', 'very', 'haunting', 'effect', 'film', 'over', 'interesting', 'sidenote', 'clearly', 'Stephen', 'King', 'borrowed', 'heavily', 'film', '2002', 'miniseries', 'ROSE', 'RED', 'many', 'details', 'aforementioned', 'automatic', 'writing', 'sequence', 'Seattle', 'setting', 'haunted', 'house', 'visual', 'imagery', 'tower', 'room', 'staircase', 'leading', 'up', 'wholesale', 'THE', 'CHANGELING']",The Changeling

The part that always stuck with me was the scene of George C. Scotts character quitely sitting down then hearing a thumping sound coming from the staircase. When he investigate the cause of the sound. He sees a ball bouncing down the staircase hitting each step as it comes down. upon examining the ball he realizes that it's his dead daughters ball wich was put away by him after his daughters death. He picks up the ball and drives to a bridge and throws the ball in the water. When he arrives back at home he enters the door and heres the same thumping sound as before. He looks up the staircase and sees a ball bouncing down every step again. when the ball finally rests on the floor in front of him. He notices that it's the same ball that he had thrown away earlier. He backs away  with a look of disbelief.

44135,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,0783116926,Jeffrey Leach,"[12, 12]","If you simply cannot avoid watching scary movies about ghosts, you are probably already intimately familiar with ""The Changeling."" Pulling off a film that actually delivers chills is not an easy task. It's my opinion that most pictures passing for horror these days never achieve any sort of scary atmosphere, instead relying on over the top gore to draw in the crowds. And to some extent, that's acceptable. I love to watch gory films. But if you seek movies that can actually make you jump, you've got a much smaller body of work to choose from. I'm not talking about films that rely on cheap scare tactics, like someone charging out of the shadows or the old ""hand on the shoulder"" gag. I'm talking about slow, subtle scares that build to a nail biting intensity over a period of time. ""The Changeling"" fits this bill quite nicely, although the film does have a few problems that occasionally get in the way of the shocks. If you enjoy this movie, you may want to check out ""The Woman in Black,"" ""The House on Haunted Hill,"" and ""Ghost Story"" for further ""spirits gone wild"" thrills and chills.John Russell (George C. Scott) watched helplessly as his pretty wife and young daughter perished in a horrible automobile accident. Overcome with crushing grief, Russell gives up his career as a composer in New York to head across the country to the state of Washington. His talents as a musician allow him to obtain a post at a local university, but he needs to find some new digs so he can maintain his privacy. A suggestion from friends leads him to the local historical society where Claire Norman (Trish Van Devere) recommends he rent out Chessman House, a local landmark currently unoccupied. Why the historical society is in the real estate business is a question without an answer, but Russell willing agrees to move into the decrepit but beautiful house anyway. To say something is wrong with this old building ranks as one of the great understatements in cinematic history. A ghost haunts Chessman House; a very angry spirit whose sole purpose in life (no pun intended--in fact, a double pun!) is convincing Russell to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding its demise. At first, Russell isn't convinced that anything is wrong with the house. Sure, he hears some weird booming noises in the middle of the night, and his piano occasionally bangs out an odd note or two when no one is around, but these oddities do convince the musician to launch an investigation into the house's history.Things really start to get weird once we learn about the background of Chessman House. According to local rumors and historical documents, a family living in the house back in the early twentieth century lost a daughter in a coal truck accident. Subsequent horrors convince our protagonist that the spirit inhabiting the building has nothing to do with this incident. For example, Russell witnesses the apparition of a young boy in a bathtub upstairs, and the voices he starts hearing don't sound like that of a young girl. In the film's best scene, a plastic ball bounces down the house's stairs and comes to rest right in front of Russell. The composer takes the toy and throws it in a nearby creek only to come home to discover the ball bouncing down the stairs again! Chilly! The truth becomes clearer in another ultra eerie scene when a psychic visits the house and channels a message from Joseph, a boy who lived in the house before the family with the girl ever arrived. It is the revenant of this young child communicating with John Russell, and the composer henceforth methodically unearths the mystery behind the ghost in Chessman House. No spoilers here, but ultimately a powerful senator, an abandoned well, and a small room in the attic provide the necessary clues in solving the mystery.I liked ""The Changeling"" immensely. Some of the creepiest stuff ever caught on camera unfolds in this movie. Even better is how the filmmakers tie in the haunting with an engaging, multileveled mystery story replete with red herrings, murder, greed, and stolen identities. I had a discussion with a person I know who also saw ""The Changeling,"" and they complained about George C. Scott being miscast in the role of John Russell. I didn't see that at all; I thought Scott a perfect fit for the part, and the actor played the character as a rational individual determined to solve the mystery of his surroundings quite convincingly and with effective nuance. If anything, it was nice to see Scott take a subtler role. Perhaps the movie's greatest difficulty lay in the failure of the filmmakers to do a better job tying in Russell's family tragedy with the otherworldly experiences of Chessman House. Here's a guy going through a catastrophe involving the demise of his wife and daughter, and yet he's trying to deal with the issues surrounding another fatality. That's probably why he does follow through with his investigation, namely as a way of working through his own personal tragedy, but the movie doesn't convey that as well as it should.Forget about any extras on the disc. If memory serves me correctly, the only thing included on the DVD other than the film was a trailer. That's disappointing considering the level of creepiness ""The Changeling"" achieves. At the very least a commentary track would have been nice, but such is not to be. Still, the movie works very well on its own without any external elaboration from the people behind the scenes. If you want something more cerebral, and scarier than the average horror flick, you'll want to see ""The Changeling.""",5,Deeply frightening,1093910400,"08 31, 2004",2004,5585,"['simply', 'can',

44137,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,0783116926,J from NY,"[4, 4]","""The Changeling"" is one of those rare haunted house films that they simply do not make anymore.  It actually has a plot and provokes some emotion from the viewer, not having to utilize retarded special effects, goofball celebrities, and senseless gore.I would characterize this film as a mood piece, and it works well.  George C. Scott does an astounding, irritable job as always, playing a composer who has lost his wife and child toa horrendous car accident.  Then, in a convenient turn of events, he moves into a house with an unpleasant history.Melvyn Douglas seems to have a knack for playing creepy old men with horrific secrets.  He's got that stern, angular face, the kind of look a stingy old grandfather would have while scolding a child for something petty.As it turns out, the house that Scott moves into was formerly inhabited by a handicapped boy who was drowned for money.  The scene in which Scott tries to evoke the spirit of the boy in a seance is unforgettable.  The only problem with the film is the ridiculously quick pace at which the intricacies of the plot are revealed.  Scott is barely living in the house for two days before he is heading to the department of psychical research and telling his friends that a ghost is trying to communicate with him.Two objects play a serious part in the film: the ball which Scott's deceased daughter used to play with, and a creaky old wheelchair.  The ball just won't stop rolling down the stairs, and the chair won't stop wheeling around in supernatural rage.What makes the movie is Scott's performance.

When I use the term ""horror"" I'm not refering to the endless supply of slasher and gross-out flicks that have co-opted the genre, I'm speaking of suspensful tales of the unknown. This is the category in which ""the changeling"" resides and I'm happy to say that it's one of the few movies of its type that stands the test of time.The changeling doesn't rely on special effects or movie monsters to tell its story. A strong script, excellent direction and fine performances have kept this film looking vibrant and feeling valid 25+ years after its initial release. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspensful thrillers (Hitchcock) or modern horror films in the mold of ""the sixth sense"". If you're looking for blood and guts or lots of violence you'll need to look elsewhere (thankfully). This film always chooses the high road to deliver its thrills. For those who don't prefer to watch R-rated films I can assure you that this film contains almost no foul langauge, has very little violence, no nudity, and certainly nothing that can be considered ""graphic"" by todays standards. Most modern films rated PG-13 have more disturbing content than this film.

The Changeling stars George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere, and Melvyn Douglas.  This movie is a combination of a supernatural ghost story and a mystery that keeps you guessing throughout.  George C. Scott plays John Russell, a music teacher who loses his wife and daughter in an accident involving a car and a truck.  Soon afterward, he moves into an old house to live by himself.  It isn't long before he realizes there is something strange going on.  He investigates various rooms in the house and unravels some family secrets of previous inhabitants of the house dating back to the turn of the twentieth century.  Some further research at the local historical society uncovers even more secrets.  The climax of the movie is violent and over-the-top and is the perfect way to end a great haunted house suspense thriller/mystery.During this movie you'll never see the ghost.  This movie was made long before CGI effects and that's a good thing.  It's what you don't see that is scary.  This movie will creep you out with its scary atmosphere.  The acting is superb throughout.  The musical score and sound effects are outstanding as well.This is one of those movies that starts out slow but gets better and better as it goes along.

44147,A3PPZAH4QGUIE,0783116926,"Jonathan Carlson ""starving screenwriter :)""","[3, 5]","The Changeling is about a recently widowed composer who moves into an enormous mansion, only to find out that there are reasons for its being empty for so long.  The mansion, haunted by the spirit of a murder victim, is old yet beautiful, and empty but full of life.  While it takes a little time before Scott realizes why exactly the mansion is haunted, the audience experiences realization with him.While there's a subtle sense of suspense within the film, for the most part the audience is left questioning the reasoning for the haunting of only the house.  Once we realize why this spirit remains, we ask ourselves why.  Is the spirit in the house because he cannot possibly leave the place of his murder?  Does the spirit remain for revenge?  Sadly, while there does seem to be resolution, it is unclear and leaves us wanting to know more.  The audience is left with too many questions of the events that took place in the house prior to Scott's entrance.Despite its flaws, the Changeling does deliver some of that subtle terror that we do not see anymore in film.  Instead of cheap thrills of having something jump out of a dark corner or over-the-top violence, we see abnormal happenings and hear strange sounds (things that are far more terrifying in film for most viewers).  The more desensitized we become to violence, the less we react to it.  Therefore, the Changeling succeeds in its classic scares.Overall, the film itself gets a 3 out of 5 stars from me.  The DVD, however, gets a 4 because it is preserved well.  If you are looking for special features, though, look somewhere else.",3,The Changeling starring George C.

44154,A15OXF84G8JKKB,0783116926,Justin Bost,"[4, 4]","***WARNING: A few plot spoilers follow!***First of all, I must say I am reviewing this film as a jaded horror fan which has seen the best and worst of horror that Hollywood has had to offer.  It seems that over the past 20 years that the trend has gone from genuinely frightening to ho-hum to laughable.  Therefore, I love it when certain &quot;new classics&quot; arise to prove that trend is not always correct.&quot;The Changeling&quot; gets the formula right on so many levels.  A haunted house done in the style of &quot;The Haunting&quot; (the Julie Harris version, not the trash that was done on the remake), but with original elements.  George C. Scott (who later went on to star in a great version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;) plays &quot;John Russell&quot;, a musician who tragically loses his wife and daughter in the blink of an eye one fateful day.  He choses to move to a vast, empty mansion in Seattle where he resides alone.  Or so he thinks.  He soon learns that he has an uninvited guest when unexplained clanging and drafts occur on a regular basis.One might argue that if this film was made today, the director may have resorted to CGI for this film, thus ruining some of the ghostly apparitions.  Maybe so, but thankfully, no cheap tricks or special effects gore clog this movie's veins.  What we encounter is a dark, melancholy house which slowly and almost imperceptibly builds an atmosphere of tension and suspense.  This atmosphere leads to a stratospheric climax in the famous &quot;seance scene&quot;, which as one previous reviewer noted, was borrowed in totality by Stephen King for his miniseries &quot;Rose Red&quot;.For that matter, while watching this film, I noticed quite a few similarities from &quot;The Others&quot; as well.  I mean, come on, a groundskeeper named &quot;Mr. Tuttle&quot;?  Also, the idea of the &quot;seen&quot; vs the &quot;unseen&quot; history of the house (for example, the piecing together of the history of its inhabitants prior to the 1920s).  &quot;The Others&quot; accomplishes this similarly with the hidden photo albums in the attic, in addition to the deliberately vague information provided by the three strangers who appear to take care of the house.  And &quot;Rose Red&quot; has the main &quot;villianess/heroine/protagonist&quot; (depending on your point of view) actually &quot;living&quot; in a hidden part of the house (whose ever changing geography was a brilliant conception of King and King alone, so far as I know).Anyhow, the thematic similarities between these three films (&quot;The Changeling&quot; of course long preceeded the other two) does nothing the sully the reputation of the two newer films.  On the contrary, I think the writers and production teams were paying homage to this film, and each of those films has many distinctive elements which make them extraordinary on their own.Trish Van Devere puts in a strong performance as Scott's co-star, &quot;Claire Norman&quot;.  It did not surprise me later to learn that she and Scott (were, Scott died in 1999) husband and wife, as their scenes together seemed very warm, natural, and convincing.  Of course, in the end, she gets the wits scared out of her and gives quite a few hearty screams.Melvyn Douglas, an accomplished actor himself, stars as &quot;Senator Joseph Carmichael&quot;.  We learn that he has an intimate connection to the occurrences at Chessman House, though I must say I was completely surprised by exactly how he fits in the puzzle.  And that is something else worth commenting on.  This is in fact a detective story of sorts, a mystery entertwined with a haunted house.  I found this very interesting, and refreshing, much in the style of &quot;The Others&quot;, the magnificent film I alluded to earlier.  There is no &quot;dramatic irony&quot; here because we literally find out what is going on as the character does.I think that some parts are a bit predictable, but it is safe to say that every viewer will be at least slightly taken off guard by the twists and turns this film takes.  And this is a good thing.  The only weaknesses in this film were the insertion of the &quot;conspiracy angle&quot; with Mrs. Huxley and the rather hokey ending with the figure of Senator Carmichael ascending the flaming staircase.  I found myself thinking of the Apostle's Creed, saying, &quot;(Jesus) died, and ascended into hell&quot; (read that carefully).  It is made clear that this is a hallucination of Scott's as another shot shows Douglas sitting at his desk at home, clutching his chest in the throes of a (fatal) heart attack.  Still, I think a much stronger ending would have had Douglas drawing a bath, then found later in his tub, dead, of a heart attack.  No special effects.  No earthquakes.  Just a frozen expression of sheer terror on his face.  And wearing his medal.  After seeing the film, you'll see what I mean by this.Anyway, I shouldn't second guess the writing/direction team on an otherwise flawless effort.  Ideally, I would rate this at four and a half stars, but five does not misrepresent the quality of the film.  Yes, it is definitely a period piece, but what horror movie isn't?  I think that if you have reasonable expectations that don't involve buckets of blood, gore, and a sensory overload of CGI, you'll really enjoy this film.",5,Good classic scares and

44155,A2BFC5WQGVP27G,0783116926,"J. W. Kennedy ""in statu uiae et meriti""","[1, 1]","What I love about this movie is the fact that it doesn't throw a lot of special effects in your face, the story does not get stupid or hokey, and the director does not try to do more than he is capable of.  This is a very modest, smartly written ghost story that delivers more genuine chills than many a big-budget schlockfest.The thing that impressed me the most when I first watched this movie almost 10 years ago was how AUTHENTIC it is.  I've read a lot of ""true"" accounts of hauntings, and they are never as dramatic as shown in the movies.  The haunting in this movie is very understated; it's mostly just eerie noises and doors slamming.  No horrible apparitions, no blood oozing down the walls, no illogical mess-with-the-audience's-mind funhouse tricks.  The creepiness builds slowly, realistically, and as a result it is much more scary.I watched it again today, and there are a few things I noticed.  Firstly, George C Scott's acting could best be described as ""subdued.""  Situations that probably would have made me jump and yell and run away, he confronts with a dull blank stare.  He seems unnerved at times (and once he gets angry at the ghost) but never really afraid.  It's interesting that I did not notice this the first time I watched.The soundtrack is quite overbearing for a movie in which sound plays such an important role.  Several times when George C Scott is alone in the house and he's reacting to something, I could not tell if he was supposed to be hearing the sounds I was hearing, or if they were ""Spooky Noises"" added to the soundtrack in order to enhance the mood.  The inappropriate sound design did not catch my attention the first time I watched, but it seemed very obvious the second time.I thought the first time I saw it that the ending was too big, and I think so even more now.  Somebody wanted this movie to have a huge Hollywood climax so they spent their budget to burn down the set, and I think it ruins the mood.  The image of the chandelier swinging as Scott climbs the stairs is unforgettable, but my overall impression of the ending is that it drops a big lump of Hollywood cheese on a movie which otherwise would have completely avoided being cheesy.  It is mainly because of the last 10 minutes that I award four stars instead of five.

44173,AFOK05KDCHSHL,0783116926,Libretio,"[7, 7]","THE CHANGELING(Canada - 1979)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby StereoWith its highbrow aspirations and classy production values, Peter Medak's elegant ghost story ranks alongside the likes of THE DEVIL AND DANIEL WEBSTER (1941) and PORTRAIT OF JENNIE (1948) as one of the most accomplished ghost stories ever filmed. It opened theatrically in 1980 amid a glut of low budget shockers which dominated US theaters at the time, and was quickly lost in the shuffle. But good movies never die, they simply bide their time, and THE CHANGELING is now widely recognized as a bona fide classic by fans and novices alike.The late and much-lamented George C. Scott plays a classical composer who is recovering from the death of his wife and daughter in a terrible accident. Having taken a teaching job in Seattle, he rents a brooding old mansion where he hopes to rediscover the meaning in his life, but his plans are interrupted by a restless spirit which makes its presence felt and reveals the details of a horrific crime which took place at the turn of the 20th century in an attic room at the top of the house, a crime which implicates a powerful local politician (Melvyn Douglas) whose career was constructed on the foundations of murder...Like the mansion itself, THE CHANGELING is a grand and stately affair which forsakes outlandish displays of supernatural horror in favor of quiet, creepy details (a door creaking open of its own accord in broad daylight; a cluttered attic room festooned with cobwebs where a child's wheelchair stands in perpetual attendance, etc.), until Scott is fored to summon a medium after being repeatedly woken every morning by an unearthly pounding which echoes throughout the entire house (the explanation for which is both credible and deeply unsettling). While the seance itself is a memorably eerie sequence, it's actually surpassed by the scene directly afterward in which Scott listens to an audio recording of the entire episode. Here, the Dolby Stereo soundtrack transforms a simple, chilling idea into one of the most hair-raising set-pieces you'll ever see. Sound actually plays a vital role in the film's seductive charm, and sensitive viewers are advised that the film is genuinely frightening in places, especially viewed late at night in a darkened room with the Dolby processor cranked up to the max! You have been warned...John Coquillon's restless camerawork transforms the ornate mansion into a character all its own, and the autumnal Seattle landscape provides scant relief from the sense of impending horror generated by Medak's accumulation of details. Performances are top-drawer, including Trish Van Devere (Scott's real-life wife) as the real estate agent who becomes mixed-up in the murder inquiry, John Colicos as a cop who thinks Scott's investigation of the crime amounts to little more than an assault on Douglas' integrity, and Ruth Springford as an elderly patron of the local historical society whose sullen attitude towards Scott's mansion conceals a darker truth and provides the first clue to its tragic history. Jean Marsh cameos as Scott's ill-fated wife.Incredibly, scriptwriters William Gray and Diana Maddox were unable to match this film's artistic success in their subsequent screen work, and while Maddox' only other movie credit appears to be THE AMATEUR (1982), Gray co-wrote scripts for routine offerings like THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT (1984) and BLACK MOON RISING (1985) before becoming a producer on the unsuccessful primetime revival of ""Dark Shadows"" (1990), amongst several other TV and movie titles. Hungarian-born director Medak, who began his career with a number of critically acclaimed black comedies like NEGATIVES (1968) and THE RULING CLASS (1972), later distinguished himself with the intense true-crime dramas THE KRAYS (1990) and LET HIM HAVE IT (1991), before losing his way on the Hollywood treadmill.",4,Classic shocker offers some genuine scares,1004572800,"11 1, 2001",2001,3908,"['CHANGELING', 'Canada', '1979', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1Theatrical', 'soundtrack', 'Dolby', 'StereoWith', 'highbrow', 'aspirations', 'classy', 'production', 'values', 'Peter', 'Medak', 'elegant', 'ghost', 'story', 'ranks', 'likes', 'THE', 'DEVIL', 'AND', 'DANIEL', 'WEBSTER', '1941', 'PORTRAIT', 'OF', 'JENNIE', '1948', 'one', 'most', 'accomplished', 'ghost', 'stories', 'ever', 'filmed', 'opened', 'theatrically', '1980', 'glut', 'low', 'budget', 'shockers', 'dominated', 'US', 'theaters', 'time', 'was', 'quickly', 'lost', 'shuffle', 'good', 'movies', 'never', 'die', 'simply', 'bide', 'time', 'THE', 'CHANGELING', 'now', 'widely', 'recognized', 'bona', 'fide', 'classic', 'fans', 'novices', 'alike.The', 'late', 'much-lamented', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'classical', 'composer', 'who', 'recovering', 'death', 'wife', 'daughter', 'terrible', 'accident', 'Having', 'taken', 'teaching', 'job', 'Seattle', 'brooding', 'old', 'mansion', 'where', 'rediscover', 'meaning', 'life', 'plans', 'are', 'interrupted', 'restless', 'spirit', 'presence', 'felt', 'details', 'horrific', 'crime', 'took', 'place', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'attic', 'room', 'top', 'house', 'crime', 'powerful', 'local', 'politician', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'career', 'was', 'constructed', 'foundations', 'murder', 'mansion', 'CHANGELING', 'grand', 'stately', 'affair', 'outlandish', 'displays', 'supernatural', 'horror', 'favor', 'quiet', 'creepy', 'details', 'door', 'creaking', 'open', 'own', 'accord', 'broad', 'daylight', 'cluttered', 'attic', 'room', 'festooned', 'cobwebs', 'where', 'child', 'wheelchair', 'perpetual', 'attendance', 'etc', 'Scott', 'fored', 'summon', 'medium', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'woken', 'morning', 'unearthly', 'pounding', 'entire', 'house', 'explanation', 'credible', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'seance', 'memorably', 'eerie', 'sequence', 'actually', 'surpassed', 'scene', 'directly', 'afterward', 'Scott', 'audio', 'recording', 'entire', 'episode', 'Here', 'Dolby', 'Stereo', 'soundtrack', 'simple', 'chilling', 'idea', 'one', 'most', 'hair-raising', 'set-pieces', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'Sound', 'actually', 'vital', 'role', 'film', 'seductive', 'charm', 'sensitive', 'viewers', 'are', 'advised', 'film', 'genuinely', 'frightening', 'places', 'especially', 'viewed', 'late', 'night', 'darkened', 'room', 'Dolby', 'processor', 'cranked', 'up', 'max', 'have', 'been', 'warned', 'John', 'Coquillon', 'restless', 'camerawork', 'ornate', 'mansion', 'character', 'own', 'autumnal', 'Seattle', 'landscape', 'scant', 'relief', 'sense', 'impending', 'horror', 'generated', 'Medak', 'accumulation', 'details', 'Performances', 'are', 'top-drawer', 'including', 'Trish', 'Van', 'Devere', 'Scott', 'real-life', 'wife', 'real', 'estate', 'agent', 'who', 'mixed-up', 'murder', 'inquiry', 'John', 'Colicos', 'cop', 'who', 'Scott', 'investigation', 'crime', 'amounts', 'little', 'more', 'assault', 'Douglas', 'integrity', 'Ruth', 'Springford', 'elderly', 'patron', 'local', 'historical', 'society', 'sullen', 'attitude', 'towards', 'Scott', 'mansion', 'darker', 'truth', 'first', 'clue', 'tragic', 'history', 'Jean', 'Marsh', 'cameos', 'Scott', 'ill-fated', 'wife.Incredibly', 'scriptwriters', 'William', 'Gray', 'Diana', 'Maddox', 'were', 'unable', 'match', 'film', 'artistic', 'success', 'subsequent', 'screen', 'work', 'Maddox', 'only', 'other', 'movie', 'credit', 'be', 'THE', 'AMATEUR', '1982', 'Gray', 'co-wrote', 'scripts', 'routine', 'offerings', 'THE', 'PHILADELPHIA', 'EXPERIMENT', '1984', 'BLACK', 'MOON', 'RISING', '1985', 'becoming', 'producer', 'unsuccessful', 'primetime', 'revival', 'Dark', 'Shadows', '1990', 'amongst', 'several', 'other', 'TV', 'movie', 'titles', 'Hungarian-born', 'director', 'Medak', 'who', 'began', 'career', 'number', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'black', 'comedies', 'NEGATIVES', '1968', 'THE', 'RULING', 'CLASS', '1972', 'later', 'distinguished', 'intense', 'true-crime', 'dramas', 'THE', 'KRAYS', '1990', 'LET', 'HIM', 'HAVE', 'IT', '1991', 'losing', 'way', 'Hollywood', 'treadmill']",The Changeling

I saw it later as a perfectly grown adult, with a mature ability to differentiate between real world and made up horrors, and still find myself awake in the dark and wondering about dusty secrets in the attic above me.This is a powerful ghost story, one that will cause your muscles to tighten into knots and force your imagination to betray you. George C. Scott looks and feels like a sad man living alone in an old, sprawling house. Strange things began to occur and those things are sensed more than seen. It happens at the edge of your vision and that will unnerve you like no big time monster ever could. The fright of this movie is of the crawling variety, the kind that makes you tense with anticipation.

It was released to relatively no fanfare in 1980, and went mostly unnoticed for many years. I, myself, was only vauguely familiar with the film, but never saw it in its entirety until about six years ago. The late great George C. Scott stars, and he delivers a fine performance as a musical composer who loses his wife and daughter in a freak accident. The story is a mystery as much as it is a ghost story, and the viewer is asked to be patient as the compelling plot unfolds. Like many films from this era, ""The Changeling"" doesn't offer the quick thrill and gore. It's a psychological journey that gets beneath your skin--if you let it.One of the film's best scenes, (and one of the greatest scenes in any film) occurs during a seance.

44182,A2M1N8G4W4END8,0783116926,Michael R Gates,"[188, 192]","Director Peter Medak's THE CHANGELING is a highly entertaining and very creepy old-fashioned ghost story.  It stars award-winning actor George C. Scott as John Russell, a musical composer who still grieves over the tragic deaths of his wife and young daughter (the film opens with the accident in which they are killed).  In an attempt to put the loss behind him and move on with his life, Russell accepts a teaching position and moves to another town, where he also rents a rather dilapidated old mansion.  It doesn't take long for him to realize that his new domicile is haunted, and when he learns that the ghost is that of a young boy who was stealthily murdered in the early 1900s, he throws himself wholeheartedly into the task of solving the mysterious crime.  He is assisted in the endeavor by the real-estate agent who arranged his rental contract, played by Scott's wife Trish Van Devere.This film follows the old-school, Hitchcockian method of sucking the unwitting audience into the fantasy and thereby creating a genuine visceral horror.  Unlike a lot of more contemporary genre fare, THE CHANGELING subtly builds tension by first concentrating on character development.  Then, once the audience has some empathy for the protagonists, the details of the haunting and the related crime slowly unfold as the film's atmosphere becomes more &amp; more eerie and more &amp; more unsettling.  So when the film's scariest events finally take place, the audience has been psychologically primed for being genuinely spooked.The acting in this film is superb.  In contrast to the arrogant, flamboyantly self-assured characters that Scott is generally famous for playing, his John Russell is a sensitive and vulnerable man who seems truly concerned with the plight of others, and Scott delivers an exceptional performance that is just this side of stupendous.  It's a shame that he wasn't offered more roles such as this.  The always beautiful Trish Van Devere does a great turn as the real-estate agent who assists Russell, and she does an especially good job and exuding terror when she is confronted vis-&agrave;-vis by things that go bump in the night.  Also turning in a wonderful performance is the highly revered Melvyn Douglas, here portraying a rather smarmy politician in one of his last roles.  Genre fans will recognize Mr. Douglas from an early performance as Roger Penderel in another spook-house film, James Whale's classic THE OLD DARK HOUSE.Like some of its notable predecessors, this old-fashioned ghost story creates lots of gooseflesh and increases the heart rate without resorting to lots of gratuitous gore or stomach-churning make-up effects.  So keep in mind, then, that fans who prefer only blood-and-guts horror may find THE CHANGELING a bit slow going.  However, anyone who enjoys great acting, great story-telling, and deep-in-the-pit-of-your-stomach psychological scares will really enjoy watching this oft-overlooked gem.",4,&quot;Did you die in this house?

It's not like modern horror movies which rely too much on cheesy special effects and gratuitous violence. The Changeling relies on a well-written plot and a dark ambiance (I sometimes wonder if this movie wasn't lit with bedroom lamps instead of studio lights). It was made on a shoestring budget of $6 million, but with its creepy atmosphere and murder mystery-style story, not to mention a sterling cast (George C. Scott and Melvyn Douglas) it overcomes any obstacles and should be remembered alongside other creepy movies such as The Haunting.I saw this movie the first time when I was about 7 and had problems being alone in the dark for quite a long time after. I slept with a nightlight until I was almost 12 just because of this movie. I think I also suffered a bout of mild depression because of the somber nature of the movie.

And, believe it or not, this ghost has a good reason for disturbing the peace.The Changeling surprised me by using just as much (if not more) plot as it did horror. The horrors you'll experience in this film are usually more psychological than visually freaky -- although you will get your share of classic ghost-related images and sounds to help you along.

44194,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,0783116926,OverTheMoon,"[5, 5]","The Changeling is not a Horror Film, it is a good old fashioned Ghost Story that is done so very well. The film, for its somewhat low-budget and minimal use of Hollywood stars, except for Scott, has managed to transcend all of its restrictions into an almost Oscar winning vehicle and yet still remains independent in look and feel to give it that cult vintage appeal.The music, set design, script and acting are all on top form however the cinematography is what makes this film stand out. Nowhere since Rosemary's Baby has a house looked so creepy and yet still remained homely at the same time. What is upstairs in this house is the kind of the place that you would never want to visit with a group, yet Scott goes up there by himself alone. Most other films of this type do silly things like putting people in haunted places when obviously they would run away in two second flat but Scott is a BIG MAN and looks tough. He could probably walk down any alley in the world unscathed. So Scott is free to roam his house and live there on his own. The audience does not disbelieve it for one second and this is why the film manages to transcend many for its type. It is that kind of eye of direction and storytelling that makes Peter Medak's little haunted house tale really shine.This film has it down-pat in atmosphere and haunting ambiance. It does scare. Just make sure that you turn off the lights and watch this one late for full impact. Watching this one during the day almost had me walking around the house looking behind doors and jumping a mile into the air when frozen icicles broke off the roof and landed on my windowsill.The premise is good - John Russell (Scott) a music professor and composer, loses his wife and family in a terrible accident. Seeking consolation, he moves into an old mansion vacant for twelve years, but a child ghost occurrence seems to be sharing the house with him. The ghost is trying to tell him something. Russell investigates the house's history and discovers a horrific secret.This movie is in the same vein as What Lies Beneath (2000), Others, The (2001) and Ring, The (2002) but is done so much better. If you like to watch intelligent ""horror"" or a really good Ghost Story yarn then hands down this is what you need.

44195,AJUEE2C2EJ0V3,0783116926,Paperbackstash,"[0, 0]","Yes, this is another haunted house/spook story.But before you allow that to deter you, listen up. The Changeling is actually creepy, it actually has a plot, and it soaks up enough originality and characterization to keep you enthralled. It manages to blend supernatural and mystery elements convincingly.We start out with a tragedy that puts you in a damp and dark mood, thinking to yourself, ""Gee life really does suck for some people more than most."" We then continue on that quiet pace and follow the poor soul to his new home, where he meets a woman who becomes an integral part of the story. What we don't see is excessive CGI, corny oddball cast members coming out of the walls, dripping blood, crazed religious nuts...we just see an old fashioned ghost story that hasn't been told the same way before or since, with nice and eerie undertones peppered throughout.Through lighting and sound effects, this movie became more ""haunting"" than any CGI laden supernatural flick could be. The old subtle way always works best -- I wish Hollywood would pick up on that.Now this isn't to say that anything really new happens in The Changeling through events. The regular ghost manifestations, things happen - there was no new twist on the old ghost and ghoul theme itself. One of the uses is of the wheelchair - very tasteful. Probably the thing that sticks out the most about the movie after a few years of not seeing it.George C. Scott acts out as John and he shines in his role. He was an outstanding actor who passed away in 1999; he will be missed. Not only was he in this genre role, but you may also remember him as the creepy and deadly John with the eye-patch in Firestarter, and the Lt. in The Exorcist 3. Trish Van Devere plays Claire but she's definitely a supporting actress here and nothing else. She helps guide the plot along for Johns' direction, and when anything eerie happens and she's around she usually leaves. Her reaction, while some modern viewers may view as cowardly, is more mainstream on how a person really would react, and I enjoy seeing realistic responses in movies like this; makes it more real and deeply felt.The director, Peter Medak, is the same man who did Species 2, believe it or not. How things change. Let me try to recapture Species 2 in my head and judge it...Oh and by the way...for those of you who say this movie would be great today if it were remade with the current special effects available...do me a favor. Blindfold yourself and take a nice walk in the middle of a busy highway. This movie - this plot! - was NOT MADE FOR EFFECTS. This would ruin the movie and I hope to God at least some people can figure this out. If we did that today this movie would be cheapened and I don't want to see that happen. We don't need another ""The Haunting"" on our hands. You may like the remake, fine, no problem, but the original haunting was in a different breed than the Changeling. Well...wait a minute, maybe it wasn't.

It's a solid 4 stars out of 6 really, but because amazon.com only allows 5 stars top it is a bit hard to reward movies of any kind between middle-good and fantastic; 4 stars describes a good movie like indeed ""The Changeling"" is.I am a big fan of ""spooky"" supernatural/phsycological-thrillers, and especially when there's a big old mansion involved. A mystery-house full of secrets. This house did not let me down, though I have to begin my review by saying that the start of this thriller looked a bit ""pale"". A door that opens itself, loud sudden unexplainable noises in the house sounding of rage and thunder -effective, it wakes your curiosity, but the first part of the movie is far more strange than scary. And -honestly- at first I thought that this is going to be a ""cute"" little ghost story involving some nice ghost trying to make contact. I was wrong.I really liked the last part of the movie that made the a bit slow start well worth it (I liked the movie from the start don't get me wrong). It was actually creepy at times. One scene that could have looked stupid turned out rather frightning, the scene involving the wheelchair and the stairs. Yes, ""The Changeling"" made an horrific turn, and had my attention entirely.The outcome of ""the ending"" was a bit confusing. Is the ghost evil? Will it find rest? If not, what will it take? It was a little unclear on that point, at least I thought it was. In my opinion either the mystery gets solved in a ghost story, and the haunting stops. That or the evil goes on. No big deal, but I was a little confused by the final scene. A couple of other scenes were also unexplained (the policeman in the car-accident).George C. Scott shines in ""The Changeling"", as he does always -I am a big fan of his work.

Scott) witnesses the death of his wife and daughter in a horrific traffic accident, and has a hard time moving on with his life. In an attempt to help, an old friend offers him a job teaching music at his alma mater. While looking for a place to live, he consults the local historical society, meeting Clare Norman (The Hearse's Trish Van Devere) and quickly finding an old mansion he falls in love with. It doesn't take him long to figure out that he's not alone there, and the bulk of the movie deals with Russell's attempts to lay the ghost who coinhabits the house to rest.Dark, spooky, and atmospheric, The Changeling is something few American horror films have been since the introduction of the slasher film. It takes time to build its characters, and its suspense, so that by the time we actually meet the supernatural forces, we're perfectly willing to suspend disbelief. Medak, who goes from television to feature film directing without a hitch on a regular basis (he's recently directed episodes of smash TV series House, Carnivale, and Law and Order: Special Victims Unit; his last big-screen foray was the unfortunately forgettable Species II), throws in enough jumps to keep the edge-of-your-seat chaps interested, and a big ""things blow up"" kind of ending for the action film fans, but if you took them away, what you'd still have as an intelligent, very well crafted supernatural thriller.

While John makes a call, his wife and daughter decide to have a snowball fight. Suddenly, a mack truck rips through the icey landscape and directly into the two, killing them instantly.A little while later, John decides he must move out of his house due to many memories that make him depressed beyond belief. With the help of Claire Norman, a worker at the local historical society, he finds an old mansion to rent out and continue to compose.Then things get frightening. Each day, very early, there is a sound of pipes clanking throught the house. He tries to compose but finds it hard still. Then, he starts to play a song. A lullaby. He plays it seemingly perfectly. When he exits the room, a key is struck on the piano-but no one is in there. Things get out of hand when John sees a vision of a little boy drowning in a bathtub.While about to take a walk outside, John is startled by a rock thrown out of a window of the attic. A room that he had no idea about. He goes up there to find a bunch of stuff. Including a music box. The music box plays the same lullaby that he played days earlier.He and Claire decide that maybe a medium could come to the house and see what's what.

44211,A26WVK274IA7DN,0783116926,Sarah Bellum,"[7, 7]","""The Changeling"" is more mystery than horror film, which is not what I had expected prior to viewing. Nonetheless, this is a good film and I would recommend it. George C. Scott plays John Russell, a classical music composer who loses his wife and daughter in an accident. In an effort to forget this tragedy, he leaves New York City for Seattle. Desiring seclusion in order to practice his compositions, he moves alone into a large, vacant house. It is here that someone, or some thing, begins to contact him. Russell, perhaps realizing he has nothing left to lose, attempts to determine the reason for this. To reveal what or who the Changeling is would be to reveal too much about the movie, so I won't do that here. Unlike some other haunted house films, the ending to this one is moderately satisfactory. The story is told with class, as one would hope for a movie with a classical music composer as it central character. There are no cheap scares, exploitive material such as nudity or gore, and scarcely any bad language.

He rents an enormous old house, (the house is so vast, it is hard to imagine one person living in it, or spending one night in it alone)which turns out to come with a ghostly presence. The overall mood and tone of the movie is very dark and sad, I was very moved when the real story behind the haunting came out. There is nothing, in my opinion, more horrific or incomprehensible than murdering a child, for any reason, but this was beyond my worst imaginings. There are many unforgettable images from the movie, most notably, the wheelchair, the ball and the child's voice on the tape recorder, but what I had a hard time getting out of my mind was the music box theme. This is apparently based on a true story, and one can only hope that the real child did not suffer the same fate in the afterworld that this poor little boy did.

I finally decided to rent it based on the good reviews from this site.  Unfortunately, the movie didn't turn out as good as I had hoped.  The director does do a good job of making the audience like his characters.  You feel sorry for Scott's character when few people believe him and you like the ghost because he was just a victim.  But that is almost part of the problem.  Because you find yourself liking the ghost, it is hard to find any of the movie very scary.  Of course, the plot would have suffered terribly if the ghost had been malevolent, but since the ghost is only trying to help Scott realize what had happened to him, it just detracts from the creepiness-factor.  Additionally, I thought much of the movie was predictable.  For example, the moment I saw Scott's character at the bridge, I new the ball would return, and this is supposed to be the creepiest part.  To finish the movie, the ending does not make too much sense (why would the ghost try to hurt Scott, who has been trying to help the ghost all along?).

Well, to my surprise, NO!This movie is based on events experienced by a real-life writer (named Russell Hunter) while he was living in a mansion.The story turns into a supernatural who-done-it (or supernatural mystery) which I found intriguing and intellectually stimulating.  You have to watch and listen carefully to follow this mystery.  The key to unlocking this mystery is to know the meaning of the word ""changeling.""To be sure, there's enough physical action to satisfy thrill seekers.  There's a creepy s&eacute;ance session, disturbing flashbacks, morbid discoveries, and one pi**ed-off wheelchair.  (For me personally, I was never frightened by all this but a creepy atmosphere was well-developed.)The writers could have gone over-the-top with this movie but they never did.  It takes time to develop Russell's character and the movie as a whole communicates true emotions.This is a George C. Scott movie.  He gives an interesting and memorable performance.  (In fact, Scott won a Genie award for his performance.)  I have to also give credit to veteran actor Melvyn Douglas who plays a senator with a horrible secret.There is another character in this movie that's not recognized in the end credits.  It's the haunted house itself!  This eerie house is used to its fullest: creepy hallways, whispers, slamming doors...its presence is always felt.The background musical score blends in with the movie's eerie images.Note that the pace of this movie is slow for today's quick-fix crowd but those with patience will be rewarded.Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2000) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has one disappointing extra.In conclusion, this is a rare gem of a movie, best described as a supernatural who-done-it.

44229,A2UP5W1BHNXMOD,0783116926,Ter,"[1, 4]","I have been a practicing professional psychic since 1992, and anytime I hear of a psychic movie I just have to watch it, to see if nothing else how close they come to reality.  Some movies are so hokey and bad that I laugh out loud!  But this one for the most part nails it.  The seance scene in particular was fairly well done, and it was refreshing to see ordinary people who are older as the psychic and her husband, instead of some 22 year old boob-job blonde and her gorgeous-guy boyfriend.  The automatic writing is exactly how I started out, where it's too big and runs off the page; my one quibble with this scene is that the woman who's the psychic would most likely have been past that early stage with automatic writing by now.  The movie was also accurate in that sounds you can't hear with your ears can be heard later on recording devices, though not always.  I've never had anything shatter, but I suppose the scriptwriter had to throw in something dramatic.  The wheelchair chasing Trish Van Devere was a bit much.  I've never seen anything like that.  But everything else was pretty spot on.  In particular the ghost communicating through the water was very accurate, as symbolism is the language on the Other Side, not words. I'm often asked why ghosts don't just speak to people.  I always answer this way: ""If you speak nothing but English and you're with people who speak only French, expect communication problems.""  In other words, they talk how they talk, not how we talk, and unless they're very experienced, they use the language that exists over there, which is symbolism, not words, which are what we use here.George C. Scott as always is a very fine actor, and there is noticeable chemistry between him and Trish Van Devere.  It was especially refreshing that there wasn't the same old tiresome fall-in-love story.  They were a man and a woman who were friends.  How unusual!  The house was perfectly cast and had just the right feel to it.  It was nice to see an older actor in the lead role who was a highly accomplished musician in the film; classical music is so little heard in movies.  I liked it that Scott's character John was both intelligent and open-minded, and I totally agreed with the guy at the college who said that most people who claim to be psychic aren't at all.  Becoming a true psychic requires an awful lot of work and an awful lot of failures before you get there, and even then you're still apt to misinterpret at times.  But still, overall, compared to some of the really RIDICULOUS psychic movies I've seen, this one was pretty close to the way I've actually experienced being psychic myself.",5,A psychic rates a psychic movie,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",2011,2648,"['have', 'been', 'practicing', 'professional', 'psychic', '1992', 'anytime', 'hear', 'psychic', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'watch', 'see', 'nothing', 'else', 'how', 'close', 'come', 'reality', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'hokey', 'bad', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'one', 'most', 'part', 'seance', 'scene', 'particular', 'was', 'fairly', 'well', 'done', 'was', 'refreshing', 'see', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'older', 'psychic', 'husband', 'instead', '22', 'year', 'old', 'boob-job', 'blonde', 'gorgeous-guy', 'boyfriend', 'automatic', 'writing', 'exactly', 'how', 'started', 'out', 'where', 'too', 'big', 'page', 'one', 'quibble', 'scene', 'woman', 'who', 'psychic', 'would', 'most', 'likely', 'have', 'been', 'past', 'early', 'stage', 'automatic', 'writing', 'now', 'movie', 'was', 'also', 'accurate', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hear', 'ears', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'later', 'recording', 'devices', 'not', 'always', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'anything', 'shatter', 'suppose', 'scriptwriter', 'had', 'throw', 'something', 'dramatic', 'wheelchair', 'chasing', 'Trish', 'Van', 'Devere', 'was', 'bit', 'much', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'everything', 'else', 'was', 'pretty', 'spot', 'particular', 'ghost', 'communicating', 'water', 'was', 'very', 'accurate', 'symbolism', 'language', 'Other', 'Side', 'not', 'words', ""'m"", 'often', 'asked', 'why', 'ghosts', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'speak', 'people', 'always', 'answer', 'way', 'speak', 'nothing', 'English', ""'re"", 'people', 'who', 'speak', 'only', 'French', 'expect', 'communication', 'problems', 'other', 'words', 'talk', 'how', 'talk', 'not', 'how', 'talk', ""'re"", 'very', 'experienced', 'use', 'language', 'there', 'symbolism', 'not', 'words', 'are', 'what', 'use', 'here.George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'always', 'very', 'fine', 'actor', 'noticeable', 'chemistry', 'Trish', 'Van', 'Devere', 'was', 'especially', 'refreshing', 'was', ""n't"", 'same', 'old', 'tiresome', 'fall-in-love', 'story', 'were', 'man', 'woman', 'who', 'were', 'friends', 'How', 'unusual', 'house', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'had', 'just', 'right', 'feel', 'was', 'nice', 'see', 'older', 'actor', 'lead', 'role', 'who', 'was', 'highly', 'accomplished', 'musician', 'film', 'classical', 'music', 'so', 'little', 'heard', 'movies', 'liked', 'Scott', 'character', 'John', 'was', 'intelligent', 'open-minded', 'totally', 'agreed', 'guy', 'college', 'who', 'said', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'claim', 'be', 'psychic', 'are', ""n't"", 'Becoming', 'true', 'psychic', 'awful', 'lot', 'work', 'awful', 'lot', 'failures', 'get', 'there', 'even', 'then', ""'re"", 'still', 'apt', 'misinterpret', 'times', 'still', 'overall', 'compared', 'really', 'RIDICULOUS', 'psychic', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'one', 'was', 'pretty', 'close', 'way', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'experienced', 'being', 'psychic']",The Changeling

I thought I'd seen every good horror movie on the market until a co-worker had me borrow this DVD. 1980's ""The Changeling"" is a quintessential low-budget vintage horror movie, done in that classic late-1970's style.  George C. Scott is a widower who is walking wounded following the freakish death of his wife and child (without giving away details, the opening scene is a hair-raiser and sets the tone for the rest of the movie).  He moves into a giant, towering mansion to work on his music and recover from his tragic loss.  But a few moments later, weird things happen inside the house.  Piano keys play by themselves.  Voices start speaking.  And loud, banging noises happen out of nowhere.  Come to find out, the house is haunted by a child.  The movie then pursues a murder mystery in which we discover the boy's identity and the history of the house.  Unlike most thrillers, ""The Changeling"" doesn't have much gore, but it has enough intense and spooky moments to make this film earn an R rating.  Instead of aiming for shock, this movie effectively works on the viewer's emotions and has a reasonably interesting plot.

I first saw this movie in the mid-1980s as a kid, and it scared the living hell out of me. Even as an adult, The Changeling still gives me a good old fashioned case of the creeps. And it will do the same for you.If you haven't seen the movie, I strongly urge you to go to the Internet Movie Database and download the trailer for The Changeling. The trailer alone is enough to make the hair raise on your neck.If there ever was a movie that was made to be watched at night in the dark, it is most definitely The Changeling. Anything less than viewing this film in a subdued, eerie atmosphere would be anti-climactic and insulting. For adding spookiness, watch this movie alone.I will not ruin the storyline, but the plot revolves around a middle-aged music professor moving cross-country to suburban Washington following the tragic death of his wife and daughter. Dr. Russel purchases a large, gothic mansion and attempts to restart his life. However, Dr. Russel quickly finds out that he has some uninvited company...Part of what makes a good movie into a classic is its influence on future films. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The Changeling has impacted haunted house movies over the past decade. Remember the frantic seance scene in The Others? How about the reflection-in-the-tub scene from What Lies Beneath? Both these films should be ashamed of themselves for plagiarising content from The Changeling.My only critique with the movie is John Russel's non-chalant, ""so what?"" attitude regarding the house. Doors slam, bangs and booms are heard throughout the night, objects move on their own, and horrifying visions are seen...yet John Russel acts as if it's no big deal.On the whole, however, The Changeling is a great, spooky film - a throwback to the era when horror movies attempted to frighten audiences by creating an eerie, unsettling atmosphere and tapping into the viewers' psychological fears. Today the horror genre has been all but destroyed with excess gore and high body counts.The Changeling is the best haunted house movie since The Uninvited.

44241,A1XX1KKXH9W7I7,0783116926,wolfgang731,"[0, 0]","Recently widowed composer, John Russell, moves back home to Seattle to take up a teaching post at the local university as well as focus on his music.  With the help of Claire Norman of the historical society, he rents an enormous, old house where he will be afforded both the space and seclusion needed to carry on with his work.  The house, which is supposedly free of any past, significant ""incidents"", seems, at first, to be a perfect choice but soon, minor inexplicable events starts surfacing until John finds himself fully submerged in the house's horrible past and he is left with no other choice but to help the tormented soul that haunts it avenge his murder 70 years earlier. I remember seeing this movie in 1980 and I remember just as vividly being scared witless that night.  I was 14 at the time and knee deep in my love of all things horror, regardless of the panic that would descend the moment bed time came. Not having seen this movie in many years, I watched it again this past weekend with a friend who'd never even heard of it and I couldn't believe that it chilled me to the bone the same way it did 29 years ago.  This movie is a lesson in horror filmmaking.  Everything is delivered  expertly and efficiently.  All the elements conspire to create a dark and menacing tale of murder and spectral vengeance. The sound editing is amazing (as is the accompanying score by Rick Wilkins) with distant banging, faint whispering and bold metallic screeching, infusing the atmosphere with pure dread.  The camera work is very effective, especially when it's used to show the ghost child's point of view, as he descends stairs, enters rooms or looks down at the partially opened door of his attic room.  The post s&eacute;ance scene is an inspired segment; an unnerving moment that manages to illuminate the story while everything around it is framed with darkness and shadows.  The small cast is excellent, with the late, great George C. Scott, bringing depth and unnerved determination to the character of John Russell.  The underrated Trish Van Devere is also first rate as Claire Norman, the historical society's liaison and John's friend and confidant.  Melvyn Douglas is equally compelling in the smaller role of the changeling, Sen. Joseph Carmichael.  This gem of a ghost story is a wonderfully crafted and executed example of what can be achieved without having to resort to the bombast and bluntness that are the lynchpins of most contemporary horror films.  Younger audiences will most likely dismiss this movie as being cheesy, lame, dated or what have you, no doubt the result of years of being bludgeoned by first rate special effects at the service of fourth rate material and talent.  I would, easily, place The Changeling on a list of top 25 modern horror films, alongside Halloween, The Exorcist, The Omen, Rosemary's Baby, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, Dawn of the Dead and Suspiria, to name a few.

44242,A1BD0IDVL32T2B,0783116926,"yorgos dalman ""yorgos dalman""","[7, 23]","I had finaly seen ""The Changeling"" after reading some good stuff about it. Haunted houses are always fascinating because the interiors in which the characters move are always ambivalent: doors can protect as well as they can lock up. Long hallways give you a chance to run as much as they can trap you in their labyrinthian web. In the worst case scenario's, the house itself can be possessed and become a character of its own.Furthermore there is the underlying story which is allways intrigueing: who or what is the spirit that disturbes the piece, why is it doing the nasty things it does, what is its own secret past and what can the characters do to lay it to its final rest. From ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Shining"", from ""Haunted"" and ""The Haunting"" all the way to variations on the subject like ""Ghost ship"" and ""Below"" (A haunted house drifting on or somewhere in the open sea).In ""The Changeling"" George C. Scott enters a abandoned house after a tragic accident which killed his wife and kid. He is a musician and the house has a wonderul room for him to play the piano and compose new material. To earn a living he teaches at the local university. But soon things happen in the old house. Noisy pounding sounds, a piano key that is struck without a finger is being seen... Soon Scott starts to look into the house's own private history and stumbles upon a family tragedy.I shall not go into this history myself and not only because there would be spoilers. I won't do it because it isn't really relevant here. Because way before the plot really unfolds I found myself being irritated by the lack of ""good work"" on behalf of the director.The pounding sounds Scott hears are so loud that they literaly break through the tension, the sounds are almost like a spoiler of their own. Furthermore, because of this ear shattering volume it's impossible to figure out whether the pounding sounds come from the house (and are part of the story) or that they are the results of an all too experimenting movie composer who wants to fill the soundtrack with abstract noises, rather then conventional music.O, but wait, there is a lot of conventional music in this film; but it is too much really. Whenever something scary or unusual tends to happen, director Peter Medak apparently didn't want anyone to miss the message that the scene was about to be scary or unusual: so when a child's toy, a little ball, mysteriously falls down the stairs, the full string orchestra burst out with `scary howling manic violins and the likes' so indeed no one could fail to understand that what is going on with that mysterious ball is in fact scary and unusual.Also the camera is a usueful means to underline the fact that something scary or unusual is going on. When Scott leaves the room in oone scene, a piano key is touched by an invisible finger. To be sure that no one would miss it, Medak lets the camera zoom in with furious intend. Leaving the sole key within the frame and the rest of the piano strategicly outside, Medak ensures himself that indeed we won't miss that scary and unsusual moment.And so on. And so on. No mood, no real eerie creepy scenes, just a lot of unnecessary bombast and just the trustful face of George C. Scott to hang on to.One thing is remarkeble however: two elements in this movie: a horrible drowning scene involving a little child and a well from which the child's skeleton later is excavated have returned years later in two critically acclaimed and rather successful Japanese horror movies: ""Dark water"" which has an appartment block haunted by the spirit of a drowned child and ""Ring"" (or ""Ringu"") which has the terrifying well in which the skeletonized body of another child is hidden.These two movies know how to scare the audience and keep them captivated with an eerie feeling throughout. Both have a strong tension that builds up and never lets go. And both have excellent use of locations, be it this time modern day menacing concrete appartment blocks in stead of big old cosy Victorian houses.So, in the end, this movie may have been of some use after all.",2,The spirits disappoint us ths time,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",2006,4087,"['had', 'finaly', 'seen', 'Changeling', 'reading', 'good', 'stuff', 'Haunted', 'houses', 'are', 'always', 'fascinating', 'interiors', 'characters', 'move', 'are', 'always', 'ambivalent', 'doors', 'can', 'protect', 'as', 'well', 'can', 'lock', 'up', 'Long', 'give', 'chance', 'run', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'trap', 'labyrinthian', 'web', 'worst', 'case', 'scenario', 'house', 'can', 'be', 'possessed', 'become', 'character', 'own.Furthermore', 'underlying', 'story', 'allways', 'intrigueing', 'who', 'what', 'spirit', 'piece', 'why', 'doing', 'nasty', 'things', 'what', 'own', 'secret', 'past', 'what', 'can', 'characters', 'do', 'lay', 'final', 'rest', 'Poltergeist', 'Shining', 'Haunted', 'Haunting', 'way', 'variations', 'subject', 'Ghost', 'ship', 'A', 'haunted', 'house', 'drifting', 'somewhere', 'open', 'sea', 'Changeling', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'abandoned', 'house', 'tragic', 'accident', 'killed', 'wife', 'kid', 'musician', 'house', 'wonderul', 'room', 'play', 'piano', 'compose', 'new', 'material', 'earn', 'living', 'local', 'university', 'soon', 'things', 'happen', 'old', 'house', 'pounding', 'sounds', 'piano', 'key', 'struck', 'finger', 'being', 'seen', 'Soon', 'Scott', 'look', 'house', 'own', 'private', 'history', 'family', 'tragedy.I', 'shall', 'not', 'go', 'history', 'not', 'only', 'would', 'be', 'spoilers', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'relevant', 'here', 'way', 'plot', 'really', 'unfolds', 'found', 'being', 'irritated', 'lack', 'good', 'work', 'behalf', 'director.The', 'pounding', 'sounds', 'Scott', 'hears', 'are', 'so', 'loud', 'literaly', 'break', 'tension', 'sounds', 'are', 'almost', 'spoiler', 'own', 'Furthermore', 'ear', 'shattering', 'volume', 'impossible', 'figure', 'out', 'pounding', 'sounds', 'come', 'house', 'are', 'part', 'story', 'are', 'results', 'too', 'experimenting', 'movie', 'composer', 'who', 'fill', 'soundtrack', 'abstract', 'noises', 'rather', 'then', 'conventional', 'music.O', 'wait', 'lot', 'conventional', 'music', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'really', 'Whenever', 'something', 'scary', 'unusual', 'tends', 'happen', 'director', 'Peter', 'Medak', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'anyone', 'miss', 'message', 'scene', 'was', 'be', 'scary', 'unusual', 'so', 'when', 'child', 'toy', 'little', 'ball', 'mysteriously', 'down', 'stairs', 'full', 'string', 'orchestra', 'burst', 'scary', 'howling', 'manic', 'violins', 'likes', 'so', 'indeed', 'one', 'could', 'fail', 'understand', 'what', 'going', 'mysterious', 'ball', 'fact', 'scary', 'unusual.Also', 'camera', 'usueful', 'underline', 'fact', 'something', 'scary', 'unusual', 'going', 'When', 'Scott', 'room', 'oone', 'scene', 'piano', 'key', 'touched', 'invisible', 'finger', 'be', 'sure', 'one', 'would', 'miss', 'Medak', 'camera', 'zoom', 'furious', 'intend', 'Leaving', 'sole', 'key', 'frame', 'rest', 'piano', 'strategicly', 'Medak', 'indeed', 'wo', ""n't"", 'miss', 'scary', 'unsusual', 'moment.And', 'so', 'so', 'mood', 'real', 'eerie', 'creepy', 'scenes', 'just', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'bombast', 'just', 'trustful', 'face', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'hang', 'to.One', 'thing', 'remarkeble', 'however', 'two', 'elements', 'movie', 'horrible', 'drowning', 'scene', 'involving', 'little', 'child', 'well', 'child', 'skeleton', 'later', 'excavated', 'have', 'returned', 'years', 'later', 'two', 'critically', 'acclaimed', 'rather', 'successful', 'Japanese', 'horror', 'movies', 'Dark', 'water', 'appartment', 'block', 'haunted', 'spirit', 'drowned', 'child', 'Ring', 'Ringu', 'terrifying', 'well', 'skeletonized', 'body', 'child', 'hidden.These', 'two', 'movies', 'know', 'how', 'scare', 'audience', 'keep', 'captivated', 'eerie', 'feeling', 'have', 'strong', 'tension', 'up', 'never', 'lets', 'go', 'have', 'excellent', 'use', 'locations', 'be', 'time', 'modern', 'day', 'menacing', 'concrete', 'appartment', 'blocks', 'stead', 'big', 'old', 'cosy', 'Victorian', 'houses.So', 'end', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'use']",The Changeling
