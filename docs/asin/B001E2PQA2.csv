It has been well over 40 years since I last saw this movie, and, having fond memories of it, and of watching Yogi cartoons, I took a chance. I can breath a sigh of relief, because it turned out to be a cute movie, albeit one I probably won't readdress any time in the near future.The story, as could be expected, is rather simple. Cindy Bear gets sent to the St. Louis Zoo, and Yogi and Boo-Boo take off on an excursion to bring her back. The songs are all rather sweet (with the exception of the excrutiating ""parade"" song by the duo). And there were actually at least two ""laugh-out-loud"" moments that I remember. (Poor Boo-Boo gets the worst of it in Cindy's Italian daydream).The animation isn't the normal Hanna-Barbera minimalization technique, but rather provides full body movement. That isn't to say that it compares to ""Lady and the Tramp"" or ""Alice in Wonderland"", but it is a step up. Warner has also provided a rather nice transfer of this 50-year-old movie.If you're looking for a nice children's movie that adults, too, can enjoy, I highly recommend this film.

1184475,A31ACI0E88ORDE,B001E2PQA2,The Great White Father,"[0, 0]","When I say it's a &#34;poor movie&#34;, I don't mean poor as in it's trash that people shouldn't watch, least of all children--I just mean it isn't put together very well.  In fact, the last time I watched this, I kept thinking of ways the story could have been written better, and paced better, and etc.And yet...for all that, I couldn't bring myself to dislike the movie, or even just to feel indifferent to it--I actively liked it.  That's why I gave it four stars instead of three stars, because they must have done something right to make it possible (especially for someone like me) to overlook story and pacing problems and just enjoy the movie as it is, and that's impressive.  I don't necessarily expect great lasting art from Hanna-Barbera, but I have Asperger's Syndrome, and I notice things like this, and so coming from me it's a great compliment that I liked it so much.  That's so impressive that it only deserves one star knocked off, and that only because it is poorly put together.In fact, a good way to demonstrate how it's a poor movie but one that I really like a lot has to do with two songs in it: I like almost all of the songs (better than I remembered, even!), but two in particular are my favorites--and yet they are placed perhaps the worst of any of them!  In each case, the song simply delays characters discovering something urgent that we the audience already know, making it hard to enjoy the songs--good songs, bad placement of them.********SPOILER ALERT********The first song is sung by the bears on the train, singing that they want to go to &#34;Saint Louis, MO&#34;--which only delays Cindy discovering something that we already knew: that her own destination of San Diego is not on the train's route, so that she does not end up where she wants to go at all.The second song is sung by Yogi and Boo-Boo when they make a marching band out of garbage they find in an alley--which only delays their finding out that Cindy is being treated as a slave by the corrupt owners of a circus, and that she needs to be rescued.  Again, something that we the audience already knew.  It would be one thing if we didn't know either thing until the characters learned it, but it makes it harder to enjoy the songs in context (and yet, somehow...I think they managed it!).********END SPOILER ALERT********So why not turn down your critical eye a notch, and watch?  (Yay-hay-hay-hee!)  Hey, at least this isn't &#34;The Man Called Flintstone&#34;--maybe that movie isn't horrible but it's a glorified episode of the Flintstones TV series parodying James Bond.
