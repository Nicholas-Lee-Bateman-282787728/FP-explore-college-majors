1602447,A2E1EFNIZL2FVA,B009V0LREI,&#9899;   RIZZO   &#9899;,"[0, 0]","Shun Li and the Poet tells of a beautiful, innocent friendship of an elderly Slav immigrant and a Chinese girl whose paths cross in Italy.  Bepi is an aging Slav who has lived in Italy for decades and Shun Li arrived on a work order from a previous position in the garment industry to the waterfront tavern.  She has left behind a young son who stays with his grandfather during her work stays.Bepi is a fisherman and hangs out in the caf&eacute; with his other older and retired buddies, and they frequent the tavern  where Shun Li works.  Bepi is called a poet by his buddies, because he can rhyme words.  When Bepi enjoys spending time with Shun Li, the gossip starts, and the buddies can&#8217;t see anything happening that is not sexual between the two.  Furthermore, Shun Li&#8217;s employer puts the pressure on her to nix the friendship.We will never know what kind of relationship this senior may and young girl would have evolved into, but what we know is that it is a tender friendship, complicated by cultural differences, peer pressure, and demands of the workplace.This is a movie that is beautifully filmed near Venice, in Choigga, a lagoon city.  Very interesting is the image of the rising waters that reach into the streets and even the tavern.  Apparently, it takes 3 hours for the water to leave the streets.  You get a glimpse into the fishing industry.The movie, 2011, is a FILM MOVEMENT, an American Film and Distribution company with fine films from around the world.  They are well directed, excellent stories.  This is a beautiful film, slow-paced, emotional, well-done,  and winner of numerous awards.

It's great seeing a place and a community you've never seen before, and that was enough for me to rate the film three stars.  But the screenplay is just underdeveloped, and the ending was surprisingly predictable and melodramatic for an indie film.  The lead actors are very good, but their relationship and characters are too sketchy.  Now, I love a lot of &#34;slow&#34;, independent foreign movies, so I don't need things to be telegraphed or fast-paced.

1602449,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B009V0LREI,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","The modern trend of globalization has led to jobs and capital rapidly and easily moving from country to country. A sudden flight of capital can quickly turn a national currency that seemed stable into one on the verge of collapse and lines of business that employed thousands can vanish to reappear in another country in a manner of a few months.Less widely reported is the movement of poor people from one country to another in search of a better life. This is not a reference to human trafficking for sex work; these are people that voluntarily move to another country to engage in what would be referred to as ""legitimate work."" Most of the people do not have enough money to pay the expenses of their passage, lodging and all necessary fees, so they go in debt to local brokers and are forced to follow their instructions until the debt is repaid.Shun Li is a young Chinese woman that has moved to a place near Rome to work in a textile factory. She is apparently unmarried, for she left her young son in China where he is being cared for by her father. Shun Li works hard to pay off the broker and to save money to bring her son to Italy.Suddenly, Shun Li is transferred to a small town along the Venetian Lagoon where she is to work as a bartender. Unable to decline the orders of the broker, she must learn Italian well enough to take drink orders and she leaves behind the people she knew.Bepi is a Slav that has been in Italy for decades and he is one of the many local fishermen that hang out in the bar. Bepi has an adult son but no wife, so the inference is that he is a widower. Bepi is called the poet because he has the habit of making rhymes. Shun Li has relatives that were fishermen, so their get to know each other moment relates to the type of nets used by Shun Li's relatives.The strength of the movie is based on the friendship that develops between an old man and a young woman from very different backgrounds. Fortunately, there is no romance, no kissing or even a hint of sex between Shun Li and Bepi. Their loneliness overpowers all the natural obstacles between them and they draw close, an event that draws scrutiny from the local gossipers. Even though Bepi's friends have known him for decades and they like Shun Li, they exhibit a distrust of foreigners, some saying that Shun Li just wants to marry him for his money and possessions, of which he has very little. This gossip draws the attention of the Chinese brokers and they force Shun Li to break off the friendship and move to another job.While there are some significant happy events at the end, there is no happy ending to this video. The underlying xenophobia on both sides of the relationship equation proves stronger than the attraction between the principals and the intelligent viewer is left with the understanding that this is no doubt a very common occurrence. People are quite comfortable with foreigners working (slaving) for and with them, but grow distrustful at any hint of the development of significant relationships between the foreigners and the locals. That is a very powerful message inherent in this video, one that is worthy of being passed on to young people in high school and college classes as well as anyone that wants to understand all the consequences of globalization.",5,An honest look at one of the major consequences of globalization,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",2013,3285,"['modern', 'trend', 'globalization', 'led', 'jobs', 'capital', 'rapidly', 'easily', 'moving', 'country', 'country', 'sudden', 'flight', 'capital', 'can', 'quickly', 'turn', 'national', 'currency', 'seemed', 'stable', 'one', 'verge', 'collapse', 'lines', 'business', 'employed', 'thousands', 'can', 'vanish', 'reappear', 'country', 'manner', 'few', 'months.Less', 'widely', 'reported', 'movement', 'poor', 'people', 'one', 'country', 'search', 'better', 'life', 'not', 'reference', 'human', 'trafficking', 'sex', 'work', 'are', 'people', 'voluntarily', 'move', 'country', 'engage', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'referred', 'legitimate', 'work', 'Most', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'pay', 'expenses', 'passage', 'lodging', 'necessary', 'fees', 'go', 'debt', 'local', 'brokers', 'are', 'forced', 'follow', 'instructions', 'debt', 'repaid.Shun', 'Li', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'moved', 'place', 'Rome', 'work', 'textile', 'factory', 'apparently', 'unmarried', 'left', 'young', 'son', 'China', 'where', 'being', 'cared', 'father', 'Shun', 'Li', 'hard', 'pay', 'off', 'broker', 'save', 'money', 'bring', 'son', 'Italy.Suddenly', 'Shun', 'Li', 'transferred', 'small', 'town', 'Venetian', 'Lagoon', 'where', 'work', 'bartender', 'Unable', 'decline', 'orders', 'broker', 'must', 'learn', 'Italian', 'well', 'enough', 'take', 'drink', 'orders', 'people', 'Slav', 'been', 'Italy', 'decades', 'one', 'many', 'local', 'fishermen', 'hang', 'out', 'bar', 'Bepi', 'adult', 'son', 'wife', 'inference', 'widower', 'Bepi', 'called', 'poet', 'habit', 'making', 'rhymes', 'Shun', 'Li', 'relatives', 'were', 'fishermen', 'get', 'know', 'other', 'moment', 'type', 'nets', 'used', 'Shun', 'Li', 'relatives.The', 'strength', 'movie', 'based', 'friendship', 'old', 'man', 'young', 'woman', 'very', 'different', 'backgrounds', 'Fortunately', 'romance', 'kissing', 'even', 'hint', 'sex', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Bepi', 'loneliness', 'overpowers', 'natural', 'obstacles', 'draw', 'close', 'event', 'scrutiny', 'local', 'gossipers', 'Even', 'Bepi', 'friends', 'have', 'known', 'decades', 'like', 'Shun', 'Li', 'exhibit', 'distrust', 'foreigners', 'saying', 'Shun', 'Li', 'just', 'marry', 'money', 'possessions', 'very', 'little', 'gossip', 'attention', 'Chinese', 'brokers', 'force', 'Shun', 'Li', 'break', 'off', 'friendship', 'move', 'job.While', 'are', 'significant', 'happy', 'events', 'end', 'happy', 'ending', 'video', 'underlying', 'xenophobia', 'sides', 'relationship', 'equation', 'stronger', 'attraction', 'principals', 'intelligent', 'viewer', 'left', 'understanding', 'doubt', 'very', 'common', 'occurrence', 'People', 'are', 'quite', 'comfortable', 'foreigners', 'working', 'slaving', 'grow', 'distrustful', 'hint', 'development', 'significant', 'relationships', 'foreigners', 'locals', 'very', 'powerful', 'message', 'inherent', 'video', 'one', 'worthy', 'being', 'passed', 'young', 'people', 'high', 'school', 'college', 'classes', 'as', 'well', 'anyone', 'understand', 'consequences', 'globalization']",N/A

The bar is patronized by local men, among them Bepi, an older fisherman from Istria. This may look like your typical movie about love between a young woman and an older man, but it isn't, although it seems to be about this up to some point.""Li and the Poet"" is a movie about being a foreigner. One who has recently arrived, one who has been living in the country for decades. About how two different cultures can get along despite seeming to have nothing in common. It's about companionship and loneliness and how this doesn't need to lead or transform into love to give your life sense and meaning.Some characters, like Devis and Li's roomate, seemed to play an important part in the film, and in fact did, but were left undeveloped and this gave me a sense of there being something missing. This is why I gave this movie 4 and not 5 stars. However, I highly recommend this film.Other films worth watching about this topic are: Carmine Amoroso's ""Cover Boy"", about the friendship of a Romanian immigrant looking for a dream that he has more chances to find in his own homeland and an unemployed Italian who feels like a foreigner also in his own homeland; and Marco Turco's ""La Straniera"", about a Moroccan prostitute struggling to make a living and a well established Moroccan architect leading a lonely life in Turin.",4,"""I am Li""",1368316800,"05 12, 2013",2013,1662,"['one', 'movies', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'not', 'only', 'plot', 'very', 'good', 'not', 'exactly', 'new', 'also', 'gorgeous', 'cinematography', 'soundtrack.Li', 'Chinese', 'immigrant', 'living', 'Rome', 'working', 'shirt', 'factory', 'transferred', 'Chioggia', 'Venice', 'assist', 'bar', 'recently', 'owned', 'Chinese', 'bar', 'patronized', 'local', 'men', 'Bepi', 'older', 'fisherman', 'Istria', 'may', 'look', 'typical', 'movie', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'older', 'man', ""n't"", 'be', 'up', 'point', 'Li', 'Poet', 'movie', 'being', 'foreigner', 'One', 'who', 'recently', 'arrived', 'one', 'who', 'been', 'living', 'country', 'decades', 'how', 'two', 'different', 'cultures', 'can', 'get', 'seeming', 'have', 'nothing', 'common', 'companionship', 'loneliness', 'how', ""n't"", 'need', 'lead', 'transform', 'love', 'give', 'life', 'sense', 'meaning.Some', 'characters', 'Devis', 'Li', 'roomate', 'seemed', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'film', 'fact', 'did', 'were', 'left', 'undeveloped', 'gave', 'sense', 'being', 'something', 'missing', 'why', 'gave', 'movie', '4', 'not', '5', 'stars', 'However', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film.Other', 'films', 'worth', 'watching', 'topic', 'are', 'Carmine', 'Amoroso', 'Cover', 'Boy', 'friendship', 'Romanian', 'immigrant', 'looking', 'dream', 'more', 'chances', 'find', 'own', 'homeland', 'unemployed', 'Italian', 'who', 'foreigner', 'also', 'own', 'homeland', 'Marco', 'Turco', 'La', 'Straniera', 'Moroccan', 'prostitute', 'struggling', 'make', 'living', 'well', 'established', 'Moroccan', 'architect', 'leading', 'lonely', 'life', 'Turin']",N/A

Lebryk,"[1, 1]","Shun Li and the Poet is a tender beautiful film about the platonic relationship between an older fisherman and a Chinese woman.This is one of those films that move along deliberately, where I cared more and more about the two main characters, Shun Li and Bepi. So much happens in the film, and yet the story is incredibly simple. This is a character study that is a pleasure to watch. Shun Li is a Chinese national that has to pay off her debt by working in Italy. Once her debt is paid, her son will join her in Italy. Although this isn't really the point of the film, Li is enslaved by her employers; they house her, move her from Rome to Venice, and decide when her debt is paid. Bepi is an older Yugoslavian fisherman that immigrated to Italy 30 years earlier. He spends a lot of time where Li tends bar. They develop a deep platonic relationship.This is a hard film to describe. It is a simple film that is incredibly enjoyable to watch. The film is set first in Rome and then in Chioggia, a small working town across the lagoon from Venice. The town is even important in this film, as one character describes, the water comes in from the sea, but doesn't always go all the way back out, some remains trapped in the lagoon. It is a beautiful thought that flows through the film.The film appears to be built haphazardly, random things happen that don't appear to be remotely important. As the film progresses, it becomes clear the director built this film carefully and with intent. What seemed like small random acts, actually build later in the film. Sometimes this can make a film difficult to watch, forcing you to concentrate on the details. Instead this is an easy film to watch, those details become apparent gradually and simply without forcing you to concentrate or pay too much attention.I expected this film to be something different. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a beautiful blend of Italian and Chinese culture without preaching. As Li and Bepi got to know each other, I learned more about their cultures, it was a natural progression.The film is not rated, and would be perfectly fine for younger viewers in the PG-13 range. I think there may have been a few strong words in the subtitles. The previews on the DVD are for all audiences (some past Film Movement DVD's have had previews with nudity).The film is presented in Chinese and Italian with subtitles. It is the perfect length at just over an hour and a half.The DVD includes a fabulous 9 minute short film. After watching a wonderful character study and thoroughly enjoying Bepi and Li, this funny little short film was perfection. Be sure to watch it all the way until a title says The End. There is an excellent punch line just after some of the credits roll.Shun Li and the Poet was an excellent film that I thoroughly enjoyed.I was provided a review sample.",5,Simple And Beautiful,1373760000,"07 14, 2013",2013,2847,"['Shun', 'Li', 'Poet', 'tender', 'beautiful', 'film', 'platonic', 'relationship', 'older', 'fisherman', 'Chinese', 'woman.This', 'one', 'films', 'move', 'along', 'deliberately', 'where', 'cared', 'more', 'more', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Bepi', 'So', 'much', 'happens', 'film', 'yet', 'story', 'incredibly', 'simple', 'character', 'study', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Chinese', 'national', 'pay', 'off', 'debt', 'working', 'Italy', 'Once', 'debt', 'paid', 'son', 'will', 'join', 'Italy', ""n't"", 'really', 'point', 'film', 'Li', 'enslaved', 'employers', 'house', 'move', 'Rome', 'Venice', 'decide', 'when', 'debt', 'paid', 'Bepi', 'older', 'Yugoslavian', 'fisherman', 'immigrated', 'Italy', '30', 'years', 'earlier', 'lot', 'time', 'where', 'Li', 'bar', 'develop', 'deep', 'platonic', 'relationship.This', 'hard', 'film', 'describe', 'simple', 'film', 'incredibly', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'film', 'set', 'first', 'Rome', 'then', 'Chioggia', 'small', 'working', 'town', 'lagoon', 'Venice', 'town', 'even', 'important', 'film', 'one', 'character', 'describes', 'water', 'sea', ""n't"", 'always', 'go', 'way', 'back', 'out', 'remains', 'trapped', 'lagoon', 'beautiful', 'thought', 'film.The', 'film', 'be', 'built', 'haphazardly', 'random', 'things', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'be', 'remotely', 'important', 'film', 'clear', 'director', 'built', 'film', 'carefully', 'intent', 'What', 'seemed', 'small', 'random', 'acts', 'actually', 'build', 'later', 'film', 'Sometimes', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'difficult', 'watch', 'forcing', 'concentrate', 'details', 'Instead', 'easy', 'film', 'watch', 'details', 'become', 'apparent', 'gradually', 'simply', 'forcing', 'concentrate', 'pay', 'too', 'much', 'attention.I', 'expected', 'film', 'be', 'something', 'different', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'was', 'beautiful', 'blend', 'Italian', 'Chinese', 'culture', 'preaching', 'Li', 'Bepi', 'got', 'know', 'other', 'learned', 'more', 'cultures', 'was', 'natural', 'progression.The', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'would', 'be', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'younger', 'viewers', 'PG-13', 'range', 'think', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'few', 'strong', 'words', 'subtitles', 'previews', 'DVD', 'are', 'audiences', 'past', 'Film', 'Movement', 'DVD', 'have', 'had', 'previews', 'nudity', '.The', 'film', 'presented', 'Chinese', 'Italian', 'subtitles', 'perfect', 'length', 'just', 'hour', 'half.The', 'DVD', 'fabulous', '9', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'watching', 'wonderful', 'character', 'study', 'thoroughly', 'enjoying', 'Bepi', 'Li', 'funny', 'little', 'short', 'film', 'was', 'perfection', 'Be', 'sure', 'watch', 'way', 'title', 'End', 'excellent', 'punch', 'line', 'just', 'credits', 'roll.Shun', 'Li', 'Poet', 'was', 'excellent', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'was', 'provided', 'review', 'sample']",N/A
1602452,A328S9RN3U5M68,B009V0LREI,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Film Movement continues to bring to our attention treasures of cinematic art that we might not otherwise see. IL SONO LI (SHUN LI AND THE POET) is one of those rare gems of a movie that in a very gentle, quiet, simple fashion tells a story that in some way connects us all. Written and directed by Andrea Segre it gives notice of a major new light in cinema and we can only hope the success of this film will encourage him to create more in this genre.Shun Li (Zhao Tao) works in a textile factory in the outskirts of Rome to enable her to get her papers that allow her eight-year-old son to come to Italy. She is part of the large Chinese organization that makes money off cheap labor in another country to keep the immigrants in a near slave like contract. She is suddenly transferred to Chioggia, a small city-island in the Veneto lagoon, to work as a bartender in a caf&eacute; pub. She rooms with another girl in similar circumstances. Bepi (Rade Serbedzija), an older Yugoslavian fisherman, nicknamed the Poet by his friends, has been a regular at that little pub for years: he left Yugoslavia at the time of the overthrow of Tito. Shun Li and Bepi are two lonely souls far away from homeland. Their encounter is a quiet almost poetic escape from solitude, a silent dialogue between cultures that are different, yet not more distant. They become close friends, but their friendship upsets both the Chinese and local communities, who interfere with this new voyage, and after confrontations and threats and fears, Shun Li returns to the factories until something beautiful happens and she returns to share this with her friend - a moment that is as touching in its surprise and tenderness as any on film.The supporting cast is strong - both Chinese and Italian - and the cinematography by Luca Bigazzi is breathtakingly beautiful. The quiet, unintrusive but salient musical score is by Franois Couturier. This film is a soulful, eloquent exploration into the human heart made more poignant because of the coming together of tow immigrants who must now share a foreign language. In Italian and Mandarin with English subtitles. Highly Recommended.

She is a factory worker in Italy trying to fulfill her transportation debt before her young son can join her. Her letters home are heartbreaking and she quietly works her way through each day, doing everything she can to get ahead of her debt.She is moved to another small town along the Venetian Lagoon where she works in a small pub with a beautiful view of the ocean/lagoon. The pub is frequented by local fisherman who are warily friendly to her. She eventually earns the camaraderie of some of the regulars especially the 'poet' (Bepi).

Angers flare and ultimatums are drawn.This beautiful filmed movie is slow paced but so eloquent.

The characters are believable, the story is never forced or contrived.It is wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. The colors are both subtle and vibrant.

Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","As a thoughtful examination of an unlikely friendship, the moving Italian film ""Shun Li and the Poet"" has a quiet sort of power that sneaks up on you. The lead character (Shun Li, played with understated grace by Zhao Tao) is an emigrant from China hoping to establish a better life with more opportunities for her son. To finance the move, she is committed to work for an organization that holds her ""debt"" and uses her for cheap labor wherever they need her. She has little contact with her father and son back in China, just plugs away at a job without ever really know where she stands in relationship to financial freedom. As we meet Shun Li, she is toiling away at a clothing factory in Rome. Her work ethic, however, has brought her a greater responsibility and a forced move to a neighborhood bar on the outskirts of Venice. Now a proprietress and manager, she deals with the regular clientele from a somewhat sedentary fishing community. It is in this lonely place that she will meet a salty local nicknamed ""The Poet"" (an effective Rade Sherbedgia) and forge a tentative bond outside of constant work.When I began watching ""Shun Li and the Poet,"" I was focused on the desperation inherent in Shun Li's position and the exploitative system in which she was embroiled. But while this is certainly significant to who Shun Li is, it is not what the movie is about. Instead, it is about wayward souls (both immigrants, he's originally from Yugoslavia) who see a commonality and a need for human connection. The film is quiet, realistic, and eminently believable. It takes its time to bring the two central characters together, but we see the subtle shifts that start to form a bond. When they do start to spend some time together, it is sweet and even cathartic. But outside influences are not kind to the mismatched pair. Her bosses think it will adversely affect her performance, his friends see it as something prurient. As depicted, however, this gentle character study has surprising and unexpected depth. As the two reveal themselves to each other, they are also revealed to the viewer. And these moments make ""Shun Li and the Poet"" so memorable and even touching. If even for a moment, these two can be a comfort to one another in a foreign land.In the end, ""Shun Li and the Poet"" is both a mood piece and a character study. If you require a big plot, this may not be for you. It unfolds at a leisurely pace and provides sequences of great sweetness and even humor. I especially liked a segment in which the town was flooded and business went on as usual despite Shun Li's obvious confusion. Credit must be given to writer/director Andrea Segre for showing incredible restraint and letting the performances and interactions speak for themselves. Both Rade Sherbedgia and Zhao Tao are incredibly effective and likable, and I think you will genuinely care for their story. The Film Movement DVD also has a nine minute short film from Craig Rosenthal called ""Shanghai Love Market."" When a mother seeks a bride for her son, no one seems good enough. The proces itself, however, leads to unexpected consequences for the central family. Amusing enough, if not on the level of the feature film, I liked this addition. But the star here is ""Shun Li and the Poet."" I've thought about this quiet film many times since viewing it, and that's always a great sign.

A truism for sure but which has seldom been illustrated so well as in ""Io sono Li"" (Li and the Poet), the first fiction film of Italian documentary maker Andrea Segre.Immigration is embodied here by two complementary figures, Shun Li and Bepi.Shun Li is a young Chinese woman who has succeeded in emigrating to Italy, without her son (whom she sorely misses) but with a debt to pay back to the illegal network that ""helped"" her to get there.Bepi, on the other hand, is an old retired fisherman and amateur poet who left Yugoslavia for the little laguna town of Chioggia thirty-five years before.Both will meet in the osteria (bar-restaurant) where Li works as a replacement barmaid and of which Bepi is a regular and a touching if difficult relationship will develop between them.That is all there is to this film in terms of narrative, but ""Io sono Li"" does not need a strong plot to manage to exist. This delicate gem actually delivers much more than its story : a fine description of a rarely shown little town in the Venetian Lagoon, an attack against illegal emigration network, a criticism of intolerance and, best of all, the sensitive portrait of two engaging loners wonderfully played by Tao Zhao (the muse of director Jia Zhangke) and Rade Serbedzija (the Croatian actor who played the bio-chemical expert in ""Mission Impossible: II).When you leave the theater you understand ""Io sono Li"" is a real achievement.It has all the virtues of a documentary without being dryly factual.It is moving, even very moving as the film comes to its close, but without resorting to cheap tear-jerking tricks.It is an involved work but its commitment is discreet and remains in the backgroundTo make a long story short, 'Io sono Li' is a remarkable first feature that should not be missed.",5,"Documentary-like, committed and ... tender",1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,1858,"['one', 'earth', 'can', 'understand', 'immigrant', 'better', 'immigrant', 'truism', 'sure', 'seldom', 'been', 'illustrated', 'so', 'well', 'Io', 'sono', 'Li', 'Li', 'Poet', 'first', 'fiction', 'film', 'Italian', 'documentary', 'maker', 'Andrea', 'Segre.Immigration', 'embodied', 'here', 'two', 'complementary', 'figures', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Bepi.Shun', 'Li', 'young', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'who', 'succeeded', 'emigrating', 'Italy', 'son', 'whom', 'sorely', 'debt', 'pay', 'back', 'illegal', 'network', 'helped', 'get', 'there.Bepi', 'other', 'hand', 'old', 'retired', 'fisherman', 'amateur', 'poet', 'who', 'left', 'Yugoslavia', 'little', 'laguna', 'town', 'Chioggia', 'thirty-five', 'years', 'will', 'meet', 'osteria', 'bar-restaurant', 'where', 'Li', 'replacement', 'barmaid', 'Bepi', 'regular', 'touching', 'difficult', 'relationship', 'will', 'develop', 'film', 'terms', 'narrative', 'Io', 'sono', 'Li', 'not', 'need', 'strong', 'plot', 'manage', 'exist', 'delicate', 'gem', 'actually', 'much', 'more', 'story', 'fine', 'description', 'rarely', 'shown', 'little', 'town', 'Venetian', 'Lagoon', 'attack', 'illegal', 'emigration', 'network', 'criticism', 'intolerance', 'best', 'sensitive', 'portrait', 'two', 'engaging', 'loners', 'wonderfully', 'played', 'Tao', 'Zhao', 'muse', 'director', 'Jia', 'Zhangke', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'Croatian', 'actor', 'who', 'played', 'bio-chemical', 'expert', 'Mission', 'Impossible', 'II', '.When', 'leave', 'theater', 'understand', 'Io', 'sono', 'Li', 'real', 'achievement.It', 'virtues', 'documentary', 'being', 'dryly', 'factual.It', 'moving', 'even', 'very', 'moving', 'film', 'close', 'resorting', 'cheap', 'tear-jerking', 'tricks.It', 'involved', 'work', 'commitment', 'discreet', 'backgroundTo', 'make', 'long', 'story', 'short', ""'Io"", 'sono', 'Li', 'remarkable', 'first', 'feature', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'missed']",N/A

This movie is the November, 2012 release in that on-going series.""Shun Li and the Poet"" (2011 release from Italy; original title ""Io sono Li""; 98 min.) brings the story of Shun Li, a migrant laborer from China now working in textiles in Rome, away from her family, most importantly her 8 yr. old son. One day, Li is informed by her (Chinese) superiors (for whom Li is just a pawn in a bigger game of money-making) that she is being transferred to Chioggia, a lagoon village near Venice, to run a cafe/pub they have just bought. The place is mostly frequented by local fishermen, among them being Bepi, himself an immigrant 30 years earlier from Yugoslavia. Li and Bepi strike a friendship, and not long after, both the local fishermen and Li's Chinese superiors do not like what is happening. Will Li get reunited with her young son? Will Bepi and Li overcome the resitance around them? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of ocmments: yes, the movie is a relationship study, and a very rich one, but the movie also brings us a study of how 2 cultures interact, seemingly as different as they are (or are they?). Beware, this is not a movie for anyone in a hurry, as the pace is slow, and frankly exquisite at that, I loved it. The scenery of the movie, set nearby Venice, is eye-candy throughout. Kudos to the lead actors, as they bring the characters of Li and Bepi just beautifully. Kudos also to the Itlaian director Andrea Segre, who brings this tale in an original and refreshing way. This is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, you cannot go wrong with this.

Shun Li has been in Italy for not so very long, and works as a textile factory worker, before being sent to be the person running a caf&eacute;. Bepi has been in Italy for 30+ years and has worked the entire time as a fisherman.Shun Li and the Poet takes a look at how two people from different backgrounds can come together and become friends. It also shows how immigrants that are easily recognized as such, are treated by the locals. Bepi, you see, isn't treated as an outsider because he looks sort of Italian and can speak the language well. While the locals, after some warming up time, take to Shun Li, they do not accept her becoming a part of one ""their own's"" life. There is also the way in which Shun Li's handlers want to control her, and because the relationship between Shun Li and Bepi causes bad press, she is forced to abandon her friendship with Bepi, or abandon the equity she has put into getting her son to Italy and also being moved to a new job once again.The film itself is well filmed, with some great landscape shots giving an air of familiarity to the surroundings. You almost feel like a resident by the end of the film.The one part I struggle with is pacing. The film takes a long time to develop, though I do admit that after the 90-ish minutes it felt like it was worth the investment in the beginning. They take time to really develop the main characters and to make you feel as if you know them.Overall, Shun Li and the Poet is a good film with what I would call minor pacing issues.Of note is that my fianc&eacute; watched only the last 30 minutes, and that was enough to have her crying at the ending.Also of note.

1602458,A2I2A7N3OCPNW4,B009V0LREI,"T. A. Daniel ""Alex""","[0, 0]","Shun Li and the Poet finds its American released in 2013, but the movie (internationally known as Io Sono Li) has been around since 2011.  Directed by Andrea Segre, Shun Li and the Poet tells the story of an unlikely friendship between a naive Chinese bartender (Shun Li) and a Slavic fisherman (Bepi).  Shun Li finds herself in Italy, moving from a labor-intensive workshop to a relatively cushy job tending bar at a seaside cafe.  Bepi and his coworkers/friends are frequent patrons at the cafe, and he soon finds himself becoming quick friends with Shun Li.  The movie is paced patiently (not slowly) so that information about these characters is divulged slowly over time.  This isn't done in a sneaky, manipulative way, but in a way familiar to all new friendships.For stories of this nature -- those that tell the story of unlikely compatriots, or foreign romances -- there's always the risk of coming across as contrived.  Segre's script keeps the relationship slow and simple, and most importantly, very believable.  One of the problems I found with Shun Li and the Poet comes from the translation to English.  Many moments of this movie are beautiful, and the translation is serviceable but it doesn't always capture the full interaction between characters.  I know this is common in movies -- dialog is pared down to its basic components so that it is easier to read.  Unfortunately, there are points where I feel like the subtitles are delivering something that doesn't quite capture these characters' interactions.Zhao Tao and Rade rbedzija both occupy their characters flawlessly.  Shun Li starts as a very quiet, naive immigrant barely able to speak Italian, but by the end we see her as confident and strong.  There's not a big to-do about this transition -- it's something that slowly unfolds with the story.  Similarly, Bepi is an older gentleman who's worked hard his whole life fishing.  He's wise and sentimental (he writes poetry), but his character is also portrayed as very believable.  The looks that they give each other, the way that they move, and just the generally way that they inhabit the space of their settings -- it's all very convincing.The film looks great.  The cinematography and scene composition is confident, and at times, completely wonderful.  The best moments come from Italy at night, or the sea surrounded by fog.  Because the general look of the movie is detailed and gritty (just by nature of the locations), some shots feel a bit overwhelming, like there's just too much to look at.  However, when the beach, or a night's sidewalk are captured, it can be stunning.  The subtitles are a much lower resolution than anything else in the movie, and they stand out in an unfortunate contrast.Shun Li and the Poet is a quiet film, and it has many touches of humor, drama, tension, and love.  There's also plenty of subtext about globalization, economics, tradition, culture, and spirituality, but none of these things are all kept as subtext so that viewers can fish out meaning for themselves.  At times, this movie feels like a novel, or a well adapted short story.

Shun Li, a migrant mother whose only son still lives in China, loves reciting poems of Qu Yuan, a renowned poet of ancient China.Bepi (Rade Serbedzija) is the ""poet,"" a former Yugoslavia-born fisherman who loves improving poems. Shun Li and Bepi, who share a common interest and background, find themselves attracted to each other.The film works best when showing Shun Li and Bepi in the quiet town of Chioggia. Obviously the first-time feature director Andrea Segre knows the town very well, as the beautifully-shot images of the lagoons show you.But the film's rather melodramatic story is nothing new. Some situations seem forced and rushed. The idea of letting someone who has been working at a textile factory (and she can barely speak Italian) manage an osteria sounds improbable.Still, Tao Zhao, a regular collaborator of Chinese art-house director Jia Zhang Ke (""The World"" ""Still Life""), delivers a quiet and deeply heart-felt performance. Equally impressive is the underplayed performance of Rade Serbedzija, a talented actor often typecast as a villain in Hollywood films, who, as in ""Before the Rain,"" shows what he can do with the right material.There is a political aspect in the film, which the director opts to downplay. But it is still there, overlapping with that of ""Gomorrah."" Unlike Matteo Garrone's more political drama, ""Shun Li and the Poet"" works as a portrayal of two lonely souls far away from homeland. It is sentimental and beautiful, and works as such.",4,(3.5 STARS) Lonely Souls,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",2013,1636,"['Shun', 'Li', 'Tao', 'Zhao', 'middle-aged', 'Chinese', 'woman', 'working', 'osteria', 'Italian-style', 'pub', 'named', 'Paradiso', 'Chioggia', 'coastal', 'town', 'south', 'Venice', 'Shun', 'Li', 'migrant', 'mother', 'only', 'son', 'still', 'China', 'reciting', 'poems', 'Qu', 'Yuan', 'renowned', 'poet', 'ancient', 'China.Bepi', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'poet', 'former', 'Yugoslavia-born', 'fisherman', 'who', 'improving', 'poems', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Bepi', 'who', 'share', 'common', 'interest', 'background', 'find', 'attracted', 'other.The', 'film', 'best', 'when', 'showing', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Bepi', 'quiet', 'town', 'Chioggia', 'Obviously', 'first-time', 'feature', 'director', 'Andrea', 'Segre', 'town', 'very', 'well', 'beautifully-shot', 'images', 'lagoons', 'show', 'film', 'rather', 'melodramatic', 'story', 'nothing', 'new', 'situations', 'seem', 'forced', 'rushed', 'idea', 'letting', 'someone', 'who', 'been', 'working', 'textile', 'factory', 'can', 'barely', 'speak', 'Italian', 'manage', 'osteria', 'sounds', 'improbable.Still', 'Tao', 'Zhao', 'regular', 'collaborator', 'Chinese', 'art-house', 'director', 'Jia', 'Zhang', 'Ke', 'World', 'Still', 'Life', 'quiet', 'deeply', 'heart-felt', 'performance', 'Equally', 'impressive', 'underplayed', 'performance', 'Rade', 'Serbedzija', 'talented', 'actor', 'often', 'typecast', 'villain', 'Hollywood', 'films', 'who', 'Rain', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'right', 'material.There', 'political', 'aspect', 'film', 'director', 'downplay', 'still', 'there', 'overlapping', 'Gomorrah', 'Matteo', 'Garrone', 'more', 'political', 'drama', 'Shun', 'Li', 'Poet', 'portrayal', 'two', 'lonely', 'souls', 'far', 'away', 'homeland', 'sentimental', 'beautiful', 'such']",N/A
