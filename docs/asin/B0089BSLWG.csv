It took me awhile to get use to The Garfield Show, in which I am starting to like. The Holiday Extravaganza came out of nowhere. I never heard about the DVD being released until I came across it in the store. Since I am a die-hard Garfield fan, I eagerly bought it.The episodes on this disc are:The Haunted House - John is out of idea for a new comic book, so he spends the weekend at Mr. Barker's new mansion, which is haunted by a ghost cat!Which Witch - The annoying twins Druscilla and Minerva are visiting John and Garfield plans on getting rid of them by sending them to a witch's house.Turkey Trouble - Jon wins a turkey through a contest in which he plans on cooking it for Liz, but the turkey isn't frozen, it is alive.Caroling Capers - Garfield goes around the neighbor singing Christmas Carols in exchange for food.Home For The Holidays Part 1 & 2 - At Christmas time Garfield only thinks about himself until Arlene shows him that there is something more meaningful than receiving is giving to others who truly need help.The Haunted House and the Wich Witch aren't set at Halloween, but they do have spooky plots. Turkey Trouble isn't set at Thanksgiving, but it is about a fun loving turkey. The other three episodes are set during Christmas! These are a wonderful collection of Garfield tales that kids will enjoy watching around the holidays.I also recommendGarfield Show: Spooky TailsandGarfield: Holiday Celebrations (Garfield's Halloween Adventure / Garfield's Thanksgiving / A Garfield Christmas)!",5,Garfield's Holiday Adventures!,1347148800,"09 9, 2012",2012,1604,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'Garfield', 'Friends', 'course', 'CBS', 'Garfield', 'primetime', 'specials', 'took', 'awhile', 'get', 'use', 'Garfield', 'Show', 'am', 'starting', 'like', 'Holiday', 'Extravaganza', 'came', 'nowhere', 'never', 'heard', 'DVD', 'being', 'released', 'came', 'store', 'am', 'die-hard', 'Garfield', 'fan', 'eagerly', 'bought', 'it.The', 'episodes', 'disc', 'are', 'Haunted', 'House', 'John', 'idea', 'new', 'comic', 'book', 'weekend', 'Mr.', 'Barker', 'new', 'mansion', 'haunted', 'ghost', 'cat', 'Which', 'Witch', 'annoying', 'Druscilla', 'Minerva', 'are', 'visiting', 'John', 'Garfield', 'plans', 'getting', 'rid', 'sending', 'witch', 'house.Turkey', 'Trouble', 'Jon', 'turkey', 'contest', 'cooking', 'Liz', 'turkey', ""n't"", 'frozen', 'alive.Caroling', 'Capers', 'Garfield', 'neighbor', 'singing', 'Christmas', 'Carols', 'exchange', 'food.Home', 'Holidays', 'Part', '1', '2', 'Christmas', 'time', 'Garfield', 'only', 'Arlene', 'something', 'more', 'meaningful', 'receiving', 'giving', 'others', 'who', 'truly', 'need', 'help.The', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Wich', 'Witch', 'are', ""n't"", 'set', 'Halloween', 'do', 'have', 'spooky', 'plots', 'Turkey', 'Trouble', ""n't"", 'set', 'Thanksgiving', 'fun', 'loving', 'turkey', 'other', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'set', 'Christmas', 'are', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'Garfield', 'tales', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'holidays.I', 'also', 'recommendGarfield', 'Show', 'Spooky', 'TailsandGarfield', 'Holiday', 'Celebrations', 'Garfield', 'Halloween', 'Adventure', '/', 'Garfield', 'Thanksgiving', 'A', 'Garfield', 'Christmas']",N/A
