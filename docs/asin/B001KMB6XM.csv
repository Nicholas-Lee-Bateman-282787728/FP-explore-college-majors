1208313,A3TZV5SXQ8F6ST,B001KMB6XM,Best Of All,"[1, 2]","This is the second sequel of the outstanding 2001 film, Behind Enemy Lines (Gene Hackman, Owen Wilson), that has gone direct-to-DVD route. Co-produced by WWE studios, it stars pro wrestler Ken ""Mr. Kennedy"" Anderson as a Navy SEAL who leads a small number of his brethren in a hostage rescue mission in Columbia and battle corrupt special forces of that nation.It is a 1980s-styled combat thriller, with Anderson a larger-than-life hero, with his decisions being made against incredible odds, but with the focus that good will ultimately triumph over evil. There are enough explosions to keep the pretty formalistic plot moving forward at a rapid pace, which should appeal to fans of this genre who are not pro wrestling fans.Where the large-screen WWE productions featuring wrestling stars like Steve Austin, John Cena and Kane proved to be box office failures, they did have surprisingly solid DVD sales. These movies are obviously targeted for a cross-over appeal to wrestling fans, but this direct-to-DVD approach may be the way to reach a wider audience much more quickly.",3,"Truth, Justice and Some Huge Explosions",1231200000,"01 6, 2009",2009,1077,"['second', 'sequel', 'outstanding', '2001', 'film', 'Behind', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'gone', 'direct-to-DVD', 'route', 'Co-produced', 'WWE', 'studios', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'Ken', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'Anderson', 'Navy', 'SEAL', 'who', 'small', 'number', 'brethren', 'hostage', 'rescue', 'mission', 'Columbia', 'battle', 'corrupt', 'special', 'forces', 'nation.It', '1980s-styled', 'combat', 'thriller', 'Anderson', 'larger-than-life', 'hero', 'decisions', 'being', 'made', 'incredible', 'odds', 'focus', 'good', 'will', 'ultimately', 'triumph', 'over', 'evil', 'are', 'enough', 'explosions', 'keep', 'pretty', 'formalistic', 'plot', 'moving', 'forward', 'rapid', 'pace', 'should', 'appeal', 'fans', 'genre', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'pro', 'wrestling', 'fans.Where', 'large-screen', 'WWE', 'productions', 'featuring', 'wrestling', 'stars', 'Steve', 'Austin', 'John', 'Cena', 'Kane', 'proved', 'be', 'box', 'office', 'failures', 'did', 'have', 'surprisingly', 'solid', 'DVD', 'sales', 'movies', 'are', 'obviously', 'targeted', 'cross-over', 'appeal', 'wrestling', 'fans', 'direct-to-DVD', 'approach', 'may', 'be', 'way', 'reach', 'wider', 'audience', 'much', 'more', 'quickly']",Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia

Demro ""Vietnam War and WWII historian""","[1, 2]","This movie is a prime example of why we watch very few American movies and instead choose International Films. The only reason my wife and I selected this movie is because Colombia is her native country. The movie HAD potential... unfortunately, as ALWAYS, the rule of thumb in Hollywood is NOT what is REALITY, but rather what is POLITICALLY CORRECT!!! [Question... are any of you as sick of it as I am..???] I finally had enough and shut it off at the point where 2 SEALS are about to be rescued by helicopter, only to have their officer in charge over-ruled by some woman who decides it's better to leave them behind like chopped hamburger - the more important message here is to illustrate the power of the woman!!! I've taught all over the globe and I can tell you foreign films have it ALL OVER the majority of films produced by Hollywood and their PC Police.

1208317,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B001KMB6XM,D.P.,"[3, 3]","I'll be honest right from the start in that I haven't seen the previous two Behind Enemy Lines movies & that I was really only interested in this movie because it was a WWE Film which all of them I've enjoyed to a certain degree so if you want to compare this movie to the previous two, I'm not the review to read.Anyways, the best way I can summarize this movie is the same way you can summarize all of WWE's films in that this is a movie that would be more received if it was made back in the 80 & 90's.  See No Evil was the slasher flick, The Marine was the action movie with car chases & fights & an overload of explosions, The Condemned was the action movie with heavy fight scenes...and this one is the military movie with gunfights & explosions, nothing more or less.  Unlike the previous WWE films where their wrestlers are the leading men, Mr. Kennedy takes the role here of the supporting actor as he's the right hand man to Joe Manganiello with his character is very similar to his wrestling personality in that he's always there for a quick one-liner comment or punchline in any situation.  The plot line here with the SEALS going on a mission that leads to them being setup to look like murderers, being put in the middle of a war with a corrupt forces, and being abandoned by their own government in the process is more diverse than the previous one-dimensional plots that we've seen from WWE Films.DVD extras include two sets of commentary including one featuring Mr. Kennedy, 4 behind the scenes features, a bloopers gag reel, and a feature on both Mr. Kennedy & Joe Manganiello complete with amateur footage of them in childhood plays they acted in.  In the end, this is a good enough for a straight-to-DVD release but the one big factor that I thought hurt the film was that with the exception of Keith David, I thought Mr. Kennedy was the better actor throughout the film but with his lines being very limited & playing the secondary role, nobody could top his diverse performance here which I thought hurt the movie but I still recommend overall at the least but for those who usually enjoy the type of movies WWE Films puts out then it's worth a purchase.",3,"Explosions, Gunfire, And Mr. Kennedy......Kennedy!",1231891200,"01 14, 2009",2009,2176,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'right', 'start', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'previous', 'two', 'Enemy', 'Lines', 'movies', 'was', 'really', 'only', 'interested', 'movie', 'was', 'WWE', 'Film', ""'ve"", 'enjoyed', 'certain', 'degree', 'so', 'want', 'compare', 'movie', 'previous', 'two', ""'m"", 'not', 'review', 'read.Anyways', 'best', 'way', 'can', 'summarize', 'movie', 'same', 'way', 'can', 'summarize', 'WWE', 'films', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'received', 'was', 'made', 'back', '80', '90', 'See', 'Evil', 'was', 'slasher', 'flick', 'Marine', 'was', 'action', 'movie', 'car', 'chases', 'fights', 'overload', 'explosions', 'Condemned', 'was', 'action', 'movie', 'heavy', 'fight', 'scenes', 'one', 'military', 'movie', 'gunfights', 'explosions', 'nothing', 'more', 'less', 'previous', 'WWE', 'films', 'where', 'wrestlers', 'are', 'leading', 'men', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'role', 'here', 'supporting', 'actor', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'Joe', 'Manganiello', 'character', 'very', 'similar', 'wrestling', 'personality', 'always', 'quick', 'one-liner', 'comment', 'punchline', 'situation', 'plot', 'line', 'here', 'SEALS', 'going', 'mission', 'being', 'setup', 'look', 'murderers', 'being', 'put', 'middle', 'war', 'corrupt', 'forces', 'being', 'abandoned', 'own', 'government', 'process', 'more', 'diverse', 'previous', 'one-dimensional', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'WWE', 'Films.DVD', 'extras', 'include', 'two', 'sets', 'commentary', 'including', 'one', 'featuring', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', '4', 'scenes', 'features', 'bloopers', 'gag', 'reel', 'feature', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'Joe', 'Manganiello', 'complete', 'amateur', 'footage', 'childhood', 'plays', 'acted', 'end', 'good', 'enough', 'straight-to-DVD', 'release', 'one', 'big', 'factor', 'thought', 'film', 'was', 'exception', 'Keith', 'David', 'thought', 'Mr.', 'Kennedy', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'film', 'lines', 'being', 'very', 'limited', 'playing', 'secondary', 'role', 'nobody', 'could', 'top', 'diverse', 'performance', 'here', 'thought', 'movie', 'still', 'recommend', 'overall', 'least', 'who', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'type', 'movies', 'WWE', 'Films', 'out', 'then', 'purchase']",Behind Enemy Lines: Colombia
