270234,A20AWXWULWTD6Z,6301810694,Boyd Henson,"[0, 0]","I could never feel bad for John. How can you feel bad for a guy who bedded Pati Behrs, Ursula Andress, Linda Evans, and a sixteen year old Bo Derek? Remember when John was supposed to take over for James Dean? Well John didn't make it as an actor but after he acquired the earth's most beautiful resource (Bo),  he figured he may as well become a movie director and use Bo in all his films. Well, John does have a way with the camera and he gets particularly inspired when Bo gets naked. Bo disrobes several times in this one in what turned out to be an attempt to demonstrate that she is, indeed, the most beautiful woman on this or any other planet and it was an unqualified success. Some will say, yeah, but if she could only act! Actually she's not half bad in this one and, although she's dwarfed in the presence of Anthony Quinn, she can stand on her own two feet, thank you. She showed she can use those two feet for dancing, as well. In fact, she performs a solo dance later in the film that is the sexiest five minutes ever recorded (that's a promise).Sure, the whole premise of the film is rather silly. Bo's much older husband (Quinn) dies, but he loves Bo so much he's willing to make a deal with a fallen angel to come back and take over a younger man's body. Only thing is it's up to Bo to seduce and kill the young fella. We soon discover she's good in the seduction department, but no so good when it comes to the killing. Don't worry, there is some gentle humor in all of this and, all in all, it's a rather pleasant diversion. Be forewarned, however, if you're a guy with a heart problem, have the nitro ready when the dance sequence begins!",4,John Derek's best film,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",2014,1659,"['could', 'never', 'feel', 'bad', 'John', 'How', 'can', 'feel', 'bad', 'guy', 'who', 'bedded', 'Pati', 'Behrs', 'Ursula', 'Andress', 'Linda', 'Evans', 'sixteen', 'year', 'old', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'Remember', 'when', 'John', 'was', 'supposed', 'take', 'over', 'James', 'Dean', 'Well', 'John', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'actor', 'acquired', 'earth', 'most', 'beautiful', 'resource', 'Bo', 'figured', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'become', 'movie', 'director', 'use', 'Bo', 'films', 'Well', 'John', 'have', 'way', 'camera', 'particularly', 'inspired', 'when', 'Bo', 'naked', 'Bo', 'disrobes', 'several', 'times', 'one', 'what', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'attempt', 'demonstrate', 'indeed', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'other', 'planet', 'was', 'unqualified', 'success', 'will', 'say', 'yeah', 'could', 'only', 'act', 'Actually', 'not', 'half', 'bad', 'one', 'dwarfed', 'presence', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'can', 'stand', 'own', 'two', 'feet', 'thank', 'showed', 'can', 'use', 'two', 'feet', 'dancing', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'solo', 'dance', 'later', 'film', 'sexiest', 'five', 'minutes', 'ever', 'recorded', 'promise', '.Sure', 'whole', 'premise', 'film', 'rather', 'silly', 'Bo', 'much', 'older', 'husband', 'Quinn', 'Bo', 'so', 'much', 'willing', 'make', 'deal', 'fallen', 'angel', 'come', 'back', 'take', 'over', 'younger', 'man', 'body', 'Only', 'thing', 'up', 'Bo', 'seduce', 'kill', 'young', 'fella', 'soon', 'discover', 'good', 'seduction', 'department', 'so', 'good', 'when', 'killing', 'Do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'gentle', 'humor', 'rather', 'pleasant', 'diversion', 'Be', 'forewarned', 'however', ""'re"", 'guy', 'heart', 'problem', 'have', 'nitro', 'ready', 'when', 'dance', 'sequence']",N/A
270235,A22IK3I6U76GX0,6301810694,Calle,"[5, 5]","Kate and Scott are the happiest couple in the world. He is much older than she is, and after getting weaker (and less virile) from a heart attack, he shoots himself. However, soon after his death, Kate realizes she can still speak to his ghost. But ghosts can't ""do it"", so they need to find a man who can die so Scott's soul can possess his body.The main reason I rented this movie was because I like watching a bad movie every now and then, and to see if it was really as bad as most reviewers said it is. And to be honest, it's not THAT bad. The story is silly of course, but silly comedies can be fun as well. But the screenplay is quite stupid and the editing between some scenes is really bad.Apparently, some scenes in the movie are meant to be spoofs of other movies. One of these scenes, where Kate is dancing, and a reverend gets mad and says something like ""she has the devil inside of her"", is supposed to be a spoof of the Joan Crawford movie ""Rain"". I haven't seen that movie, so to me the scene seemed like just an attempt to make a funny scene with a funny character. And it is quite fun, but only because it's stupid. It doesn't make any sense. And most of the humor in the movie seems to be unintended. I'm not even sure John Derek's ambition was to make a silly comedy, or if he tried to make a romantic drama-comedy.Bo Derek is famous for being naked in her movies, but if that's your reason for seeing this movie, you will probably be disappointed. She does get naked a few times, in a couple of very short sequences. She's also well known for being named ""the worst actress of the decade"" (the 80s). And she is not good, but not quite that bad. And the screenplay with its stupid dialogue doesn't help her.To sum up, this movie is quite stupid, but not quite as bad as most critics say. If you, like me, enjoy watching bad movies for a laugh, I can recommend this one. My rating would be 2 and a half stars if that was possible. But since I can't give half stars, 3 seems more fair than 2.",3,"Flawed and silly, but entertaining.",1014422400,"02 23, 2002",2002,2011,"['Kate', 'Scott', 'are', 'happiest', 'couple', 'world', 'much', 'older', 'getting', 'weaker', 'less', 'virile', 'heart', 'attack', 'shoots', 'However', 'soon', 'death', 'Kate', 'can', 'still', 'speak', 'ghost', 'ghosts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'need', 'find', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'die', 'so', 'Scott', 'soul', 'can', 'possess', 'body.The', 'main', 'reason', 'rented', 'movie', 'was', 'like', 'watching', 'bad', 'movie', 'now', 'then', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'reviewers', 'said', 'be', 'honest', 'not', 'THAT', 'bad', 'story', 'silly', 'course', 'silly', 'comedies', 'can', 'be', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'screenplay', 'quite', 'stupid', 'editing', 'scenes', 'really', 'bad.Apparently', 'scenes', 'movie', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'spoofs', 'other', 'movies', 'One', 'scenes', 'where', 'Kate', 'dancing', 'reverend', 'mad', 'something', 'devil', 'inside', 'supposed', 'be', 'spoof', 'Joan', 'Crawford', 'movie', 'Rain', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'so', 'scene', 'seemed', 'like', 'just', 'attempt', 'make', 'funny', 'scene', 'funny', 'character', 'quite', 'fun', 'only', 'stupid', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'most', 'humor', 'movie', 'be', 'unintended', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'sure', 'John', 'Derek', 'ambition', 'was', 'make', 'silly', 'comedy', 'tried', 'make', 'romantic', 'drama-comedy.Bo', 'Derek', 'famous', 'being', 'naked', 'movies', 'reason', 'seeing', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'get', 'naked', 'few', 'times', 'couple', 'very', 'short', 'sequences', 'also', 'well', 'known', 'being', 'named', 'worst', 'actress', 'decade', '80s', 'not', 'good', 'not', 'quite', 'bad', 'screenplay', 'stupid', 'dialogue', ""n't"", 'help', 'her.To', 'sum', 'up', 'movie', 'quite', 'stupid', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'bad', 'most', 'critics', 'say', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'bad', 'movies', 'laugh', 'can', 'recommend', 'one', 'rating', 'would', 'be', '2', 'half', 'stars', 'was', 'possible', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'half', 'stars', '3', 'more', 'fair', '2']",N/A

Ghastly line delivery combines with cut-rate special effects as well as glimpses of Ms. Derek's augmented chest and emaciated limbs.  Yet you might also interpret the movie as a sad commentary on John Derek's realization that he loved a much younger woman and would die long before she did...and that she would go on to mate with younger guys in tropical locales.As for Bo, I don't know if she dropped off the face of the earth herself.  If she doesn't get a reality show of her own pretty quick, only us old folks will remember that she existed at all, and we are of course reluctant to mention her name because we must explain &quot;cornrows&quot; at the same time.See the movie just so you can talk about it at a party someday...it will become more relevant as the years go by.",3,John Derek fantasizes about his own death,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",2003,901,"['literalist', 'standpoint', 'seeing', 'did', 'John', 'Derek', 'was', 'still', 'alive', 'movie', 'embarrassment', 'Ghastly', 'line', 'delivery', 'combines', 'cut-rate', 'special', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'glimpses', 'Ms.', 'Derek', 'augmented', 'chest', 'emaciated', 'limbs', 'might', 'also', 'interpret', 'movie', 'sad', 'commentary', 'John', 'Derek', 'realization', 'loved', 'much', 'younger', 'woman', 'would', 'die', 'long', 'did', 'would', 'go', 'mate', 'younger', 'guys', 'tropical', 'locales.As', 'Bo', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'dropped', 'face', 'earth', ""n't"", 'get', 'reality', 'show', 'own', 'pretty', 'quick', 'only', 'old', 'folks', 'will', 'remember', 'existed', 'are', 'course', 'reluctant', 'mention', 'name', 'must', 'explain', 'quot', 'cornrows', 'quot', 'same', 'movie', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'talk', 'party', 'someday', 'will', 'become', 'more', 'relevant', 'years', 'go']",N/A
270238,A2UOG9WW4FYYIZ,6301810694,"Marty Martinez ""movie fan""","[8, 9]","Bo Derek stars in this strange tale, which shows the tragic ineveitability of a May/December marriage. The plot is strangely similar to her own relationship with director/photographer husband John Derek, who was 30 years her senior.Anthony Quinn stars as her rugged, well-traveled and adventurous husband who stubbornly lives life to the fullest - despite his weak heart. After he commits suicide, his ghost (with the aid of lovely angel Julie Newmar) begins to haunt his grief-stricken widow. Desperate to rekindle her lost romance, Bo embarks on an international search to find a man of physical perfection. Her outrageous plan is to kill this man once she finds him, so her husband's spirit can ""possess"" his body, and they can live happilly ever after. To me, this film showcases John Derek's considerable talent as a photographer, but not as a filmmaker. I believe that Bo Derek is truly the most beautiful woman to ever appear on the silver screen, but this was never quite enough to carry the films in which John Derek tried to showcase her. The locations take us from the snowy plains of Montana to the beaches of Sri Lanka, but the absurd script and bizarre editing take away from the sincerity that this films tries so hard to convey. When John Derek passed away in 1998 from a massive heart attack, I remembered this film and decided to see it again. I actually enjoyed it more than when I first saw it, because I appreciated the autobiographical themes (as well as watching Bo frolicking nude). Leonard Maltin once called this film a ""standard Derek atrocity,"" but I feel like this was more of a voyeuristic peek into the life of this mysterious and intriguing couple. Though she never matched the meteoric success of ""10"", Bo Derek will always be a stunning example of what a movie star really is. Maybe she's isn't a great actress or intellectual, but in the ""old school"" way of cinematic appreciation, she is a true movie star - and these days that's really rare...",3,Art Imitates Afterlife,1062028800,"08 28, 2003",2003,1980,"['Bo', 'Derek', 'strange', 'tale', 'tragic', 'ineveitability', 'May/December', 'marriage', 'plot', 'strangely', 'similar', 'own', 'relationship', 'director/photographer', 'husband', 'John', 'Derek', 'who', 'was', '30', 'years', 'senior.Anthony', 'Quinn', 'rugged', 'well-traveled', 'adventurous', 'husband', 'who', 'stubbornly', 'life', 'fullest', 'weak', 'heart', 'suicide', 'ghost', 'aid', 'lovely', 'angel', 'Julie', 'Newmar', 'haunt', 'grief-stricken', 'widow', 'Desperate', 'rekindle', 'lost', 'romance', 'Bo', 'international', 'search', 'find', 'man', 'physical', 'perfection', 'outrageous', 'plan', 'kill', 'man', 'husband', 'spirit', 'can', 'possess', 'body', 'can', 'live', 'happilly', 'ever', 'film', 'John', 'Derek', 'considerable', 'talent', 'photographer', 'not', 'filmmaker', 'believe', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'truly', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'ever', 'appear', 'silver', 'screen', 'was', 'never', 'quite', 'enough', 'carry', 'films', 'John', 'Derek', 'tried', 'showcase', 'locations', 'take', 'snowy', 'plains', 'Montana', 'beaches', 'Sri', 'Lanka', 'absurd', 'script', 'bizarre', 'editing', 'take', 'away', 'sincerity', 'films', 'tries', 'so', 'hard', 'convey', 'When', 'John', 'Derek', 'passed', 'away', '1998', 'massive', 'heart', 'attack', 'remembered', 'film', 'decided', 'see', 'again', 'actually', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'appreciated', 'autobiographical', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'watching', 'Bo', 'frolicking', 'nude', 'Leonard', 'Maltin', 'once', 'called', 'film', 'standard', 'Derek', 'atrocity', 'feel', 'was', 'more', 'voyeuristic', 'peek', 'life', 'mysterious', 'intriguing', 'couple', 'never', 'matched', 'meteoric', 'success', '10', 'Bo', 'Derek', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'stunning', 'example', 'what', 'movie', 'star', 'really', 'Maybe', ""n't"", 'great', 'actress', 'intellectual', 'old', 'school', 'way', 'cinematic', 'appreciation', 'true', 'movie', 'star', 'days', 'really', 'rare']",N/A
