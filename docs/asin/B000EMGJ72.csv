It's not that she doesn't like them; it's just that she's convinced herself that they don't like her.Put it down to a slight case of bohemian snobbishness or superior closed mindedness, or the fact that they just can't handle this highly-strung woman who obviously doesn't fit in and tries far too hard to be liked.Yet the Stones' are intent to have a picture-perfect Christmas in their gorgeously decorated and rambling New England colonial. The matriarch Sybil (Diane Keaton) and her pleasant husband Kelly (Craig T. Nelson), a college professor, apparently always welcome their five adult children home for the holiday. Only the eldest daughter Amy (Rachel Macadam) appears to find this at all arduous.The kids are truly and eclectic and loveable bunch with the traditional wife-and-mother Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), the good-hearted slacker Ben (Luke Wilson) and the deaf one Thad (Ty Giordano) rounding out the group. Thad also turns up with his black boyfriend (Ryan White), who is without question, an integral part of the family.Everett is determined to marry Meredith although his mother knows that she is not right for him, and she's hesitant to give him her mother's antique engagement ring.  Meredith, the nervous New Yorker, quickly feels hostility from both Sybil and Amy, and to make matters worse, she forces Amy to sleep on the couch, whilst taking her room. Meredith also manages to say all the wrong things in regard to lovable young Thad.The irony is that the Stone's are convinced they're the most open-minded people in the world, but the doors of tolerance are positively closed to Meredith.  Only the easygoing stoner Ben makes an effort to put Meredith at ease. With the Stones constantly judging her and doing a number on her self-confidence, Meredith buses in her sister Julie (Claire Danes) as an ally. Things, however, start to become difficult as Everett takes a liking to Julie and Meredith is drawn to Ben.The Family Stone is part comedy and part drama with talented director Thomas Bezucha fashioning a traditional and even sweet story about love. The film works perfectly, hitting all the right notes, mostly due to the talented cast - Keaton, Danes, Macadam, Wilson and Mulroney all turn in fine performances, bringing all the dynamics of the Stone family to life with all their petty jealousies and squabbles.Suffice to say that the star of the film is the lovely Sarah Jessica Parker as the emotionally pulled-back and strictured Meredith. She has the resilience of a lion, yet after suffering all the humiliations thrown upon her, she eventually lets her hair down and relaxes. It's a performance that is winning and endearing and it is everything we have come to like from her.This is a funny, elegant and touching film - and while it does tend to overdo the melodrama, especially towards the end - it is still a wonderful homage to the holiday season. Bezucha should indeed be congratulated - he set himself a formidable task, yet he manages bring out the very best in The Family Stone's ensemble of strong, and distinctive A-list actors.

974517,AUJFO0J9A2HGE,B000EMGJ72,Alcee Arobin,"[6, 8]","I recently saw this film and enjoyed it enough to defend it against some of the more negative reviews found here.  I'll try to make this as compact as possible, while addressing some of the recurring issues.First of all, yes, the plot twists are predictable, but I don't think Thomas Bezucha was exactly trying to hide what most of us expected to happen.  Those sly, stalled glances a character might make in the direction of another, or the way two characters might connect over a conversation?  That's the way movies have always indicated internal feelings not openly voiced in dialog.  If you (like myself) predicted the end, you're not ultra perceptive.  You just picked up on the obvious.But more importantly, I don't think this film was trying to shock or surprise anyone.  What I saw was a clever (if cliche) comedy-drama about an outsider trying to acclimate herself to a group of eccentrics.  Surely I'm not the only one who can relate?The scene that will undoubtedly register the strongest opinions will be the family dinner, when Meredith attempts to voice her own hesitance about having a gay child, to a proud mother and father of an openly gay son.  We, the viewers, understand that there is no malice or prejudice in her comments, but the family overrides her and treats her with absolute truculence.  I think most of us were probably left feeling sorry for her, or at least those of us know what it's like to think one thing, but always find a way of mucking up our vocal articulation.  We envy people like Meredith's sister Julie, who have no trouble camouflaging themselves to whichever environment in which they happen to land.As for the family and their attitude toward their guest, I think it showed the nasty side of die-hard liberal intellectualism (and there is a nasty side to everything).  Mind you I would probably be considered by many of my friends and associates to be one of those die-hard liberals.  As such, I recognize all too well the figures in this film, who have just as great a tendency to treat others unfairly, especially those whom we perceive to be judging someone else unfairly.  The irony is of course that we're all passing judgment.  Again, reference the dinner scene.  The parents lash out at Meredith for the perceived disrespect and judgment of their son as not ""normal,"" while remaining ambivalent to the fact that they are also unfairly judging Meredith.  But to anyone who would argue this point as a shortcoming of the film, remember that eventually it is the family that apologizes to Meredith.To conclude:  is this film predictable?  Yes.  Is the storyline anything notably innovative?  No.  Was the sappy factor over the top?  Of course.  So why then would I still recommend this film?  Because beyond the flaws, there is something genuine and heartfelt in this movie that I found quite charming and endearing.  It is a fairy tale reflection of the trials all families face in at least some form, at some time.  And who can't remember the pressure that accompanied you the first time you met the significant other's family?

974518,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,B000EMGJ72,Alistair McHarg,"[4, 8]","The Family Stone is that rarest of creatures, a thoroughly delightful romantic comedy that walks the fine line between maudlin sentimentality and stupid unfunnyness - no mean feat when the setting is a New England family Christmas where new love interests are introduced.There is much that is stereotypical about the Stones.  Currier & Ives art-directed their house and yard, Abercrombie & Fitch furnished it, Volvos litter the driveway.  Everyone is prosperous in an offhanded sort of way, liberal hipness reigns - one daughter sports an NPR tote bag, a son ""works"" as a documentary filmmaker, and a late arrival evaluates artistic grants for the Rockefeller Foundation.  (I'm so sure!)But there is also much that is atypical.  One son is deaf, gay, and in a committed relationship with a gentleman of the Afro-American persuasion - they intend to adopt soon.  Mom (played to perfection by Diane Keaton) is going down for the count and has little time left to exert her considerable influence.  If there is prejudice and bigotry to be found in The Family Stone, it is of the ""knee-jerk Liberal"" variety, and director Thomas Bezucha lampoons it very deftly.Into this tinsel-town strolls Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) who is romantically linked with son Everett (Dermot Mulroney).  (I first encountered Parker in the marvelous Tim Burton movie Ed Wood and was immediately struck by her presence and skill.  That talent has apparently caused everyone to overlook her on-screen limitations which remind one of the old joke about the horse that walks into the bar.)Meredith begins as the type-AAA, uptight, neurotic, self-absorbed shrew everyone loves to hate and finishes absolutely absorbed into this warm and transformed family.  The journey between these poles is touching and at times hilarious.  Special points to Luke Wilson, his Ben has the exact slacker vibe Meredith desperately needs.  Claire Danes, as Meredith's sister Julie, is a pleasing ornament and offers one of the greatest entrances ever seen on film.The Family Stone is a keeper.

974520,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000EMGJ72,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 7]","I know that in the end `The Family Stone' may be predictable.  Okay, I won't lie, it is pretty much `very' predictable, but there is something more here that really makes me love this film from start to finish.  The concept of a significant other meeting their lover's family for the first time and completely falling out with them is not new by any means.  In fact I think there are at least a dozen or so films each year to broach the subject, but again, there is something about `The Family Stone' that makes all of that forgivable.  Maybe it's the approach, the pure dramatic elements mixed within this comedy that make the feel more relatable, more real to me.  There are scenes of pure uncomfortable silence and or conversation that make this movie appeal to me because I swear it could and probably does happen all of the time.  The dinner scene alone is so unbearable intense you'd almost forget you're supposed to be watching a comedy.  `The Family Stone' is for lack of a better word a `dramedy' in that it has it's moments of comedic bliss but it never loses it's foundation of real life drama.  No matter how funny the movie may get the audience is always aware that this is real life and real life isn't always a good time.The film follows Meredith Morton, an uptight business woman who is meeting her boyfriend's family for the first time over the Christmas holiday.  Well, she has met his youngest sister once before, but that didn't go so well, so she's ultimately dreading meeting the entire lot of them.  Her boyfriend Everett knows that his family is a little difficult but he really wants this weekend to work out since he's planning on asking his mother for `the family stone', an engagement ring she promised him when he found `the one'.  Everett's family is eccentric, especially compared to Meredith, and this alone makes her a bit uncomfortable.  She can sense the dislike in Everett's sister Amy's eyes and can tell that Everett's parents, particularly her mother Sybil, think her strange.  Everett also has a sister Susannah and a brother Thad but it's his brother Ben who really makes the largest impression, not just on Meredith but on the movie itself.  Luke Wilson has never been an actor I'd call truly talented.  Sure, he's had his films where he was tolerably funny, but here he reaches new highs for me.  I'm not saying he's Oscar worthy, but he sure is best in show.So, as the days tick by Meredith butts heads with everyone in the household one by one.  So much so that she insists on leaving to stay in a hotel and has her sister Julie come down to stay with her for moral support.  Julie, a stark contrast to her sister, is immediately welcomed into the arms of the Stone household and this is almost too much for Meredith to bear.  Everything she says is taken the wrong way and used against her while everyone is free to speak to her how they like.  It's funny because my wife and I had too very contrasting opinions about this film and who was `in the right'.  I felt that the Stone family was way too hard on Meredith who was just a little different but an all around good person.  My wife felt that Meredith was too stuck up and needed a reality check.  You can make your own assumptions.The acting here is what makes the film endearing.  It truly is a great cast of actors.  Sarah Jessica Parker is phenomenal as Meredith.  I personally never watched `Sex in the City' regularly, and the few films I've seen with Parker were less than impressive, but here she truly shines.  Diane Keaton is another shining star.  Her performance is far from her best but she gives her character enough warmth to balance out her hysterics.  I mentioned already how Luke Wilson is best in show here, and I mean that wholeheartedly.  Claire Danes, an actress with whom I am eternally smitten, is only in the film for a short while but her few scenes are well done and effective.  Rachel McAdams is a young actress on the rise and her performance here is fresh and witty and impressive.  She plays the perfect little sister, flawed yet lovable.  Craig T. Nelson is not used as strongly as he could have been but he does have one very commanding scene (that uncomfortable dinner scene I was talking about) where he's used to his full.  Brian J. White, who plays Thad's lover Patrick, does a great job with what little screen time he's given.  His character is one that is sympathetic and understanding, one that seems to feel for Meredith's situation.  Elizabeth Reaser and Tyrone Giordano are not really used much here.  Their characters fall into the backdrop, especially Reaser's character of Susannah.  Same can be said for Dermot Mulroney who is not the strongest of actors and who seems to take a backseat to just about everyone else.The film, while not as original as it could have been, still delivers in many areas.  In fact it's one of my favorite films of 2005, a film that I can seriously watch again and again and enjoy it immensely.  Sure, it has its flaws, but what film doesn't.  I won't deny it's imperfections but there's something warm and raw about `The Family Stone', and that quality makes me come back for more.",5,There's just something about this film that warrants my

Secondly, watch it! I loved watching the family just be a family, with or without Meredith or Julie in the picture. I loved how Brad got thrown into the plot, and the entire way the family lives and moves on in life is fascinating to watch. I love how they try to like Meredith but they just can't. I love how unbelievably embarressing it is to watch Meredith try to fit in. I love how, eventually they make you feel sorry for her, even if it does take a while. I love how it's not the perfect happily ever after, or the one you would have expected, but it works perfectly with the story.I love how, even though about half way through it, you know who's gonna end up with who, but you still don't know how it will happen. I love how honest the Stone Family is. I love the fact that one of the Stones is gay, you rock Thad! I love how Meredith learns to relax a little bit, despite how hard it is. And, I must admit, I love Amy. She just has this charming wit and sarcasm, and it makes it so much easier to watch Meredith mess up. Instead of watching Meredith, I watch Amy's reaction!I love how almost anyone can relate to at least one of the family members. I love how different aspects of life were delicately and sometimes not so subtley weaved into the story. I love the emotion and troubles the family has to go through, and how the movie presents those troubles.I love the humor, and the creativity, originality, and love. But most of all, I love the movie in itself. I strongly, strongly suggest this to anyone. You're bound to love it as much as I did.By the way, if you're wondering what my 1st all time favorite movie is, it's JUST LIKE HEAVEN, starring Reese Witherspoon. Check that one out too.

While I don't think this will ever take its place beside ""It's A Wonderful Life"" or ""A Christmas Story"", I did find it an enjoyable look at family life at Christmas.  Maybe because my children are now young adults, I could relate to this mother's coping with her adult children coming home to nest at the holidays.Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson portray the parents of five diverse offspring.  But it is Sara Jessica Parker, as uptight and unsexy as you have ever seen her, that causes the crisis in the family.  She is the woman favorite son Everett (Dermott Mulroney) brings home to pass the family inspection.  The most unexplainable part of this movie is why the family instantly hates her.  They have been forewarned by daughter Amy (Rachel McAdams) but it is out of character for these strong-minded people to be so easily swayed by her flippant remarks.  Swayed they are, however, and combine to make life so miserable for poor Meredith that she moves to a local inn and calls in her sister (Claire Danes) for moral support.  Naturally, the sister is instantly beloved by all.  Add Luke Wilson as the ne'er do well son, Tyrone Giordono as the gay son who brings his black lover home, and Elizabeth Reaser as the married sister who returns home with children in tow, and you have the makings of a comedy drama that is enjoyable in its lush New England setting, its romantic pairings, and its tear-jerker ending.",4,Enjoyable Holiday Movie Combines Comedy and Drama,1136851200,"01 10, 2006",2006,1569,"['always', 'enjoy', 'heart-warming', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'afternoon', 'sometimes', ""'m"", 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'one', 'spirit', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'ever', 'take', 'place', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'did', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'look', 'family', 'life', 'Christmas', 'Maybe', 'children', 'are', 'now', 'young', 'adults', 'could', 'relate', 'mother', 'coping', 'adult', 'children', 'coming', 'home', 'nest', 'holidays.Diane', 'Keaton', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'portray', 'parents', 'five', 'diverse', 'offspring', 'Sara', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'uptight', 'unsexy', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'crisis', 'family', 'woman', 'favorite', 'son', 'Everett', 'Dermott', 'Mulroney', 'home', 'pass', 'family', 'inspection', 'most', 'unexplainable', 'part', 'movie', 'why', 'family', 'instantly', 'have', 'been', 'forewarned', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'character', 'strong-minded', 'people', 'be', 'so', 'easily', 'swayed', 'flippant', 'remarks', 'Swayed', 'are', 'however', 'combine', 'make', 'life', 'so', 'miserable', 'poor', 'Meredith', 'local', 'inn', 'sister', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'moral', 'support', 'Naturally', 'sister', 'instantly', 'beloved', 'Add', 'Luke', 'Wilson', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'son', 'Tyrone', 'Giordono', 'gay', 'son', 'who', 'black', 'lover', 'home', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'married', 'sister', 'who', 'home', 'children', 'tow', 'have', 'makings', 'comedy', 'drama', 'enjoyable', 'lush', 'New', 'England', 'setting', 'romantic', 'pairings', 'tear-jerker', 'ending']",N/A

From the get go, The Stones don't like Meredith, so she calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come back her up.I think the main reason for me that this movie was so awful is that every character in this movie was so dreadfully and disgustingly dysfunctional and the film offered me nothing to hope for with no chance whatsoever to even like ANY of the characters.Save your money and save your time.

Pinzka ""Book Friend""","[47, 54]","This sort of movie has been done to death, one would think - look at names that are listed in preceding reviews - and while Family Stone fails to provide an earthshattering new insight into the set piece, I think it's a cut above average.For one thing, the family itself is only slightly disfunctional in its relationships among one another, a distinct relief.  For example, the gay son is loved and accepted, as is his partner.  There are hints that the mother may have been too clinging but, all in all, the now-adult children of Mr. and Mrs. Stone, magnificently portrayed by Diane Keaton, seem to be handling their lives with aplomb and success.The Family Stone rolls out its disfunction when a newcomer attempts to join the family. The catalyst for this family gathering is Christmas, probably the worst of holidays for families in general because Chritmas is also the annual festival of dashed expectations, at first material and quickly psychological. A scene late in the movie, when Parker's character distributes presents, demonstrates this motif beautifully.Our first hint that things will go badly is a scene where some members of the family mock the inniment-fiancee of the eldest son before she has even arrived with the son for a first-time visit.  Then you notice that the husband of the only other child (of five) who is married has delayed his arrival until Christmas Day.  Hmmmm...what does he know?And badly things do go, usually in an over-the-top and frantic way saved only by the extraordinary acting skill and comfortable (or appropriately uncomfortable) ensemble work of the excellent cast (besides Keaton, there's Craig T. Nelson, Dermot Mulroney, Luke Wilson, Rachel McAdams, and Sarah Jessica Parker).  These people take nastiness to new heights and I believe if all of us hadn't been through something similar at some point in our lives we'd insist it was unrealistic.  C'mon...think a little harder, about what happened when Aunt Sally got tipsy last Thanksgiving and decided to tell your Dad what it was like being the younger, ""dumber"" one, all those years ago?Parker also is particularly good, portraying a buttoned-down (but fashionable) Wall-Street yuppie, at least 150-degrees different from her flighty role and Sex and the City.I enjoyed Family Stone more than I expected to, and it made me think about how families work (and don't work), too.

""It's trying to be a comedy, a drama, and a romance,"" others complain. ""Too many subplots,"" others lament.On the first complaint (""dysfunctional family films""), I'd have to agree. There are a TON of them out there (Look Who's Coming to Dinner, The Squid and the Whale, and In Her Shoes, just to give you a sprinkling.) But what does that have to do with the quality of THIS film? Nothing.On the second complaint (""too many genres""), I'd have to say, ""What the Hell are you talking about!"" The mixing of genres has been going on since celluloid productions started. And I don't really care if they mix genres as long as the story/script/acting is good - The Family Stone definitely had a great story/script/acting.And on the third and final complaint (""many subplots""), I'd have to say ""So what."" Subplots are an excellent way to let the story unfold without getting heavy handed with one of the other genres (i.e., too much drama versus excessive comedy).The story...The Stone family is getting together for the Christmas season. Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) is bringing with him his girlfriend whom he has intentions of asking to marry during the family's gathering. Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) is this fianc?-to-be and she's so uptight you think her head might pop off at any moment. Her type-A personality is extremely excessive, so much so that she wears perfectly fitting gray outfits, has her hair wound-up securely on her head, and rarely laughs or smiles. Meeting up with the Stone family, she's about to be head-dunked into a realm she's never before experienced. This new family has a gay, deaf son (Tyrone Giordano) whose partner is black (talk about a dynamic!), a daughter (Rachel McAdams) who's met Meredith and damages her reputation before she ever sets foot in the Stone home, the matriarch of the house (Diane Keaton) who's medical secret threatens to destroy this year's festivities, the patriarch (Craig T. Nelson) who's trying to hold the fraying ends of the family together, and finally we have Meredith's sister (Claire Danes) who's called in to act as a support person for Meredith but ends up getting more involved with the Stone family than she'd ever hoped.The beginning of the film is front-loaded with plenty of laughable moments. Sarah Jessica Parker's character (Meredith) has a nervous tic which involves clearing her throat, and this is used to great comedic advantage. The dialogue is also excellently laid out as we see Meredith say to one of the more obnoxious Stone family members, ""I don't care if you like me or not."" To which the Stone replies, ""Aw ... of course you do.""As the film progresses, however, we get to see much more of the family's problems. Mother is very ill. Everett may not be in love with Meredith. Everett's brother has a ""thing"" for Meredith. And the list goes on. What makes this portion work is its realism. There are so many dynamics to this family. They don't have just one. Ever. You get in tight with the Stone family, whether you like it or not, and this can seem very uncomfortable to some viewers, especially those who can identify with one or more of the characters.And that's why this movie works. All of the actors (even Craig T. Nelson) don't force the issues. The Family Stone comes tumbling off the screen and it's funny, sad, irritating, beautiful, angering, spiteful ...it's family. Yes, it's been done before, but that doesn't mean you won't like this version.

974553,A1EOLRV216BXJ9,B000EMGJ72,Classic Movie watcher,"[4, 7]","It began a few days before Christmas. Mrs. Stone (Diane Keaton) was the well-loved mother of five grown-ups - Amy (Rachel McAdams), Susannah (Elizabeth Reader), Thad (Tyrone Giodarno), Ben (Luke Wilson),Everett (Delmot Mulroney). The siblings were close, well brought-up, liberal, open-minded and all adored their parents.Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker), Everett's girl friend, brought in tension with her uptight and serious manner and the Stone family had problems showing hospitality. Nothing Meredith did could improve their impression, especially Mrs. Stone's and Amy's, and things kept spiraling down the wrong path. Worse still, Everett wanted to claim the family stone, grandma's ring, to propose to her. What everyone saw wrong in Meredith, Everett ignored until Meredith's sister, Julie (Clare Danes), was called in and the truth finally dawned on him.The closeness of the Stone family was portrayed beautifully. Love and respect abound. Meredith's values would surely jeopardize the unity of the family and more importantly, made Everett unhappy. The family accepted Julie as readily as they rejected Meredith. Yet Meredith did one thing right. Her Christmas gifts melted their hearts.Rachel McAdams (Notebook, Wedding Crashers) is brilliant, young and uncompromising. Luke Wilson and Tyrone Giodarno as brothers are perfectly convincing. Clarie Danes as the lovable Julie often steals the scene. The outburst scene at the dinner table is well-captured. I also like the comical and hilarious touch when Meredith is rejected (twice!) and ended up with a roar of laughter, including Meredith herself, among the women.The message of the movie is clear - you never know who's the right person until you meet him/her; once you do, you should go for it and let bygones be bygones. The only not so realistic plot is that not a single moment is lost after losing one's love - true love turn ups so soon.

Not exactly, well, not for her.  Merideth is uptight and classy, different from her boytoys family, and much to her dismay, they hate her.  So much so that they will do anything to make her stay uncomfortable.  They accuse her of being racist, they accuse her of hating gays (Everitts brother Thad is gay and his lover is black) they make her feel unwelcome and as if she were putting out the whole family, especially younger sister Amy (played brilliantly by Rachel McAdams)...In fact they make her feel so unwelcome that she ends up staying in a nearby hotel and calling her sister Julie to come and stay with her.  Take note that while a comedy this movie has quite a few emotional points and theres a dinner scene that left me quite uncomfortable.  The acting across the board is brilliant with Keaton and McAdams taking the lime-light, and Parker is just amazing in her role, with equally impressive performances by WIlson, Daines and Nelson.

I went into the theatre with very high hopes but what ""Family Stone"" delivers is not unique or speacial as I was hoping it would be...the film is a prototype romantic comedy which on occasion I can most certianlly enjoy - but with a cast as great as this one I was certianlly hoping for a little bit more that what it delivered.I thought that the story line was pretty basic, Sarah Jessica Parker plays an up-tight mid-30's buisness woman who is dating one of the Stone's 3 boys (5 children in all), as the movie unfold .Diane Keaton (The mother) with a little help from daughter Rachel McCadams basiclly ride Sarah Jessica Parker to the brink of destruction. This effort to break the two up eventually works but in what is a very spiraling plot, Sarah Jessica ends up getting together with yet another one of the Stone's boys. As you can imagine in any movie Sarah Jessica eventually somewhat loosens up and gets accepted as family. I dont know if I mentioned this but Sarah Jessicas now ex-boyfriend hooks up with Caire Daines (Parker's Sister), the reason that Sarah Jessica's sister is a part of this fiasco is because she called her,basically for back up against the brutal Family Stone.Diane Keaton who as I mentioned is the mother figure of the Family Stone suffers for a serious breast cancer which is slowly killing her, as the movie comes to a close it shows the family 1 year later without Keaton (who obviously dies from the battle with the cancer), it is no suprize but is certianly a sad ending to the loveable charactor Keaton.I am not a big fan of little romantic comedys but if you are than I would recommend this film to you.Grade: B-",3,"3.5 stars, All-Star cast delivers a decent flick",1147219200,"05 10, 2006",2006,1867,"['really', 'people', 'stared', 'Family', 'Stone', 'when', 'realized', 'who', 'was', 'decided', 'had', 'go', 'see', 'would', 'prove', 'be', 'good', 'film', 'cast', 'would', 'take', 'went', 'theatre', 'very', 'high', 'hopes', 'what', 'Family', 'Stone', 'delivers', 'not', 'unique', 'speacial', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'film', 'prototype', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'occasion', 'can', 'most', 'certianlly', 'enjoy', 'cast', 'as', 'great', 'one', 'was', 'certianlly', 'hoping', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'what', 'delivered.I', 'thought', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'pretty', 'basic', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'up-tight', 'mid-30', 'buisness', 'woman', 'who', 'dating', 'one', 'Stone', '3', 'boys', '5', 'children', 'movie', 'unfold', '.Diane', 'Keaton', 'mother', 'little', 'help', 'daughter', 'Rachel', 'McCadams', 'basiclly', 'ride', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'brink', 'destruction', 'effort', 'break', 'two', 'eventually', 'works', 'what', 'very', 'spiraling', 'plot', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'up', 'getting', 'together', 'yet', 'one', 'Stone', 'boys', 'can', 'imagine', 'movie', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'eventually', 'somewhat', 'up', 'accepted', 'family', 'dont', 'know', 'mentioned', 'Sarah', 'Jessicas', 'now', 'ex-boyfriend', 'hooks', 'up', 'Caire', 'Daines', 'Parker', 'Sister', 'reason', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'sister', 'part', 'fiasco', 'called', 'basically', 'back', 'up', 'brutal', 'Family', 'Stone.Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'mentioned', 'mother', 'figure', 'Family', 'Stone', 'suffers', 'serious', 'breast', 'cancer', 'slowly', 'killing', 'movie', 'close', 'family', '1', 'year', 'later', 'Keaton', 'who', 'obviously', 'battle', 'cancer', 'suprize', 'certianly', 'sad', 'ending', 'loveable', 'charactor', 'Keaton.I', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'little', 'romantic', 'comedys', 'are', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'you.Grade', 'B-']",N/A

Craig Nelson (of ""Coach"" fame) is the big surprise among the actors -- he brings a quiet power to his role as the patriarch of a diverse, free-thinking, multi-culti family somewhere in New England.  Other cast members include Dermot Mulroney (hunk, likeable), Luke Wilson (likeable, great comic timing), Sarah Jessica Parker (one-dimensional, not very interesting), Diane Keaton (not much depth to her character, little for her to work with), Claire Danes (omigod, she's so wonderful! Wish she had more to do here...) and Rachael McAdams (who?)Individually, most of the actors do fine work, but as an ensemble they seldom gel... I think this is mostly due to poor direction -- the large-group repartee looks and feels like all the lines were shot separately and strung together by the editor -- there's no flow to these sequences.  Scenes with just two actors in them are much more convincing.  The plot is so-so -- there are, perhaps, too many elements, encompassing gays and gay marriage, social friction between liberals and conservatives, romantic hijinks, and families having to deal with terminal illnesses such as breast cancer.  It was probably a very thoughtful, intelligent script that got reworked and mashed down by some Hollywood committee, and the end result just couldn't stand up to critical scrutiny.As it is, this is a mildly entertaining film, a good-natured, modern-day mash-up of George S.

The fact that this cringe fest resonates with some people is a testament to how far the concept of family has degraded.  Each and every character is in their own way loathsome, engaging in the sort of behavior that should - for a person with a shred of self-respect - result in a severing of all ties and possibly a serious fist shaking cuss out, if not a punch in the mouth.  Not a single one of the people portrayed would be tolerable for the length of an elevator ride, never mind for the length of this steaming ripe sack of movie.  You find yourself rooting for the supposed ""confused"" character (over-played to a crisp by Parker) to take cruel revenge on each of her tormentors.  By the end none of the people assembled in this world are doing anything that makes any sense, even in the context of this facile representation of a family.  If you buy into the idea of Hollywood being full of degenerates who are incapable of producing a film that rings true because they are so far removed from the real world, here is the centerpiece of your argument.  Apparently the people making this thought there would be an audience somewhere for whom it would work.  I can only guess that for them it did.

Maybe it would have been more fun if it had been -- even if it wouldn't exactly be a heartlukewarming Christmas picture, with the required happy (and sad) endings, and all the characters one would expect in a twenty-first-century ""family"" movie.Staid yuppie Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) is about to pop the question to his uptight girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker), using the ""family stone,"" an heirloom engagement ring. But when he takes her to visit his family for Christmas, it turns out that his sister has managed to poison the entire clan against his might-be-fiancee.Soon abusing Meredith has become the family's new pasttime, and even Everett is starting to have second thoughts about proposing. Meredith's only confidantes are her sister (Claire Danes) and Everett's easygoing brother (Luke Wilson). Tension builds as Christmas approaches, and several surprising secrets come out...Black comedies are always great if done right -- Wes Anderson's work is a prime example, with twisted, alienated families and the wrong words spoken at the right time. ""Family Stone"" aims for the same target, but misses -- it's simply too cruel and illogical to be funny or amusing. Even ""Monster-In-Law"" gave its cruel in-law a reason to be cruel.Most of the humor comes from abusing Meredith, and if she were as twisted as the Stones seem to be, then it might be darkly amusing. But she seems nice, if stiff, and so there are no laughs, especially since the Stones have no reason to dislike her. They welcome Patrick, their deaf son's boyfriend, so why not Meredith? Because her hair is pinned back too tightly?Woven in are bits of necessary family drama: pregnancy, tangled romances, cancer to throw in a bit of pathos, and characters who serve no real purpose in the script except to fill dinner table chairs. It's overwritten and overly self-conscious; it plumbs as many family cliches as it can, and then takes them over the top.And whose idea was it to have boyfriend-stealing portrayed as okay?What saves ""Family Stone"" from being another tired holiday movie? Individual performances: Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams, despite the thinness of their characters, are a joy to watch. Parker gives a decent performance, and Wilson gives a surprisingly charming performance as Ben, with a whiff of pot and a lazy smile.""Family Stone"" suffers from an illogical storyline and a busload of cliches, but is redeemed somewhat by performances by the lead actors.

974575,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B000EMGJ72,Ed Uyeshima,"[1, 4]","Writer-director Thomas Bezucha has assembled such a strong, surprisingly compatible ensemble cast that you root for him to produce a holiday classic blending family comedy hi-jinks and soap opera pathos. However, his mixed bag screenplay does not quite hit its marks, especially the predictable fish-out-of-water set-up that dominates the first half of the film. Set mainly in a wintry New England household right out of a Hallmark Christmas card, the story revolves around the Stone family's holiday preparations, which focuses on the arrival of oldest son Everett who is bringing his intended fiancee Meredith with him.The decidedly raffish Stones are a close-knit, exclusionary clan who have an immediate discomfort with the tightly wound Meredith, an obsessed prig of an overachiever who does not like to be touched or cajoled into situations where she doesn't have full control. Everett's need to look and act perfect is the reason why he is drawn to her, but the family sees an obvious mismatch, especially the salty, take-no-prisoners matriarch Sybil. Everett's snappish sister Amy already hates Meredith from a previous encounter, but laid-back brother Ben is oddly sympathetic to Meredith's outsider status. Meredith seeks emotional reinforcement by begging her sister Julie to come join her. There is also Everett's pregnant sister Susannah with young daughter in tow, as well as Thad, the ebullient youngest son who happens to be deaf, gay and trying to adopt a child with partner Patrick.That's quite a few characters to track over the course of a 102-minute movie, and one of the main challenges for me is to feel engaged enough with their individual dilemmas. For a holiday film, I do like how the Stones are portrayed not as pretentiously convivial but more as a dynamic, temperamental family unit. Bezucha provides one surprisingly powerful dinner table scene where Meredith makes an unfortunate comment about Thad that she fruitlessly tries to justify to an increasingly enraged Sybil. This oddly insular 2005 film could have used more scenes with the emotional honesty of that exchange, but it unfortunately defaults to well worn comedy elements to ensure the viewer is not put off. Even the poignant ending feels slightly disingenuous for the stacked-deck approach to the inevitable fate of one of the key characters.The acting is mainly solid, though in a few cases, quite predictable, and in one case, affecting to the point of transcendent. As Meredith, Sarah Jessica Parker seems to overplay her unlikable role toward stereotype. Besides, her straight-laced character's transformation is just a little too jarring to be believable, as she first channels Miranda and then shifts to Carrie in a flash. Dermot Mulroney seems to be stuck in a rom-com rut playing the handsome leading man yet again, though as Everett, he does manage a few moments that delve more than skin-deep toward the end of the film.As comic foil Ben, Luke Wilson seems to be doing a parody of his brother Owen. Back in ""Mean Girls"" mode, Rachel McAdams makes a vivid impression as the vitriolic Amy, while Claire Danes, despite an introductory pratfall of no consequence, is called on to be either supportive or smitten as Julie. It's good to see Craig T. Nelson again (even though we certainly heard him in ""The Incredibles"") as he plays family patriarch Kelly with sympathetic aplomb, but it is the redoubtable Diane Keaton who makes her moments count in likely her best dramatic part since ""Marvin's Room"". In what could have been a stoically masochistic role, she provides sharp bite and torrents of mother love with honest fervor.The DVD has a surprisingly robust set of features starting with two commentary tracks - a spotty, anecdotal one by Parker and Mulroney, and the other a somewhat more informative one by Bezucha, producer Michael London, editor Jeffrey Ford, and production designer Jane Ann Stewart. There are also three featurettes - two brief Fox Movie Channel specials focused on the casting and the movie's premiere, a Q&A; session with much of the cast, a rather dull gag reel and relatively worthless deleted scenes. There is even a recipe for Meredith's wholly unappetizing strata included.",3,Keaton and Others Shine Even Though the Predictable Plot Turns Divert Any Genuine Interest,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",2006,4206,"['Writer-director', 'Thomas', 'Bezucha', 'assembled', 'strong', 'surprisingly', 'compatible', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'root', 'produce', 'holiday', 'classic', 'blending', 'family', 'comedy', 'hi-jinks', 'soap', 'opera', 'pathos', 'However', 'mixed', 'bag', 'screenplay', 'not', 'quite', 'hit', 'marks', 'especially', 'predictable', 'fish-out-of-water', 'set-up', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'Set', 'mainly', 'wintry', 'New', 'England', 'household', 'right', 'Hallmark', 'Christmas', 'card', 'story', 'Stone', 'family', 'holiday', 'preparations', 'arrival', 'oldest', 'son', 'Everett', 'who', 'bringing', 'intended', 'fiancee', 'Meredith', 'him.The', 'decidedly', 'raffish', 'Stones', 'are', 'close-knit', 'exclusionary', 'clan', 'who', 'have', 'immediate', 'discomfort', 'tightly', 'Meredith', 'obsessed', 'prig', 'overachiever', 'who', 'not', 'like', 'be', 'touched', 'cajoled', 'situations', 'where', ""n't"", 'have', 'full', 'control', 'Everett', 'need', 'look', 'act', 'perfect', 'reason', 'why', 'drawn', 'family', 'obvious', 'mismatch', 'especially', 'salty', 'take-no-prisoners', 'matriarch', 'Sybil', 'Everett', 'snappish', 'sister', 'Amy', 'already', 'Meredith', 'previous', 'encounter', 'laid-back', 'brother', 'Ben', 'oddly', 'sympathetic', 'Meredith', 'outsider', 'status', 'Meredith', 'emotional', 'reinforcement', 'begging', 'sister', 'Julie', 'come', 'join', 'also', 'Everett', 'pregnant', 'sister', 'Susannah', 'young', 'daughter', 'tow', 'as', 'well', 'Thad', 'ebullient', 'youngest', 'son', 'who', 'be', 'deaf', 'gay', 'trying', 'adopt', 'child', 'partner', 'Patrick.That', 'quite', 'few', 'characters', 'track', 'course', '102-minute', 'movie', 'one', 'main', 'challenges', 'feel', 'engaged', 'enough', 'individual', 'dilemmas', 'holiday', 'film', 'do', 'how', 'Stones', 'are', 'portrayed', 'not', 'pretentiously', 'convivial', 'more', 'dynamic', 'temperamental', 'family', 'unit', 'Bezucha', 'one', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'dinner', 'table', 'scene', 'where', 'Meredith', 'unfortunate', 'comment', 'Thad', 'fruitlessly', 'justify', 'increasingly', 'enraged', 'Sybil', 'oddly', 'insular', '2005', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'more', 'scenes', 'emotional', 'honesty', 'exchange', 'unfortunately', 'well', 'worn', 'comedy', 'elements', 'ensure', 'viewer', 'not', 'put', 'off', 'Even', 'poignant', 'ending', 'feels', 'slightly', 'disingenuous', 'stacked-deck', 'approach', 'inevitable', 'fate', 'one', 'key', 'characters.The', 'acting', 'mainly', 'solid', 'though', 'few', 'cases', 'quite', 'predictable', 'one', 'case', 'affecting', 'point', 'transcendent', 'Meredith', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'overplay', 'unlikable', 'role', 'stereotype', 'straight-laced', 'character', 'transformation', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'jarring', 'be', 'believable', 'first', 'Miranda', 'then', 'shifts', 'Carrie', 'flash', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'be', 'stuck', 'rom-com', 'rut', 'playing', 'handsome', 'leading', 'man', 'yet', 'again', 'Everett', 'manage', 'few', 'moments', 'delve', 'more', 'skin-deep', 'end', 'film.As', 'comic', 'foil', 'Ben', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'be', 'doing', 'parody', 'brother', 'Owen', 'Back', 'Mean', 'Girls', 'mode', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'vivid', 'impression', 'vitriolic', 'Amy', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'introductory', 'pratfall', 'consequence', 'called', 'be', 'either', 'supportive', 'smitten', 'Julie', 'good', 'see', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'again', 'even', 'certainly', 'heard', 'Incredibles', 'family', 'patriarch', 'Kelly', 'sympathetic', 'aplomb', 'redoubtable', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'moments', 'count', 'likely', 'best', 'dramatic', 'part', 'Marvin', 'Room', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stoically', 'masochistic', 'role', 'sharp', 'bite', 'torrents', 'mother', 'love', 'honest', 'fervor.The', 'DVD', 'surprisingly', 'robust', 'set', 'features', 'starting', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'spotty', 'anecdotal', 'one', 'Parker', 'Mulroney', 'other', 'somewhat', 'more', 'informative', 'one', 'Bezucha', 'producer', 'Michael', 'London', 'editor', 'Jeffrey', 'Ford', 'production', 'designer', 'Jane', 'Ann', 'Stewart', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'featurettes', 'two', 'brief', 'Fox', 'Movie', 'Channel', 'specials', 'focused', 'casting', 'movie', 'premiere', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'much', 'cast', 'rather', 'dull', 'gag', 'reel', 'relatively', 'worthless', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'even', 'recipe', 'Meredith', 'wholly', 'unappetizing', 'strata', 'included']",N/A

I'm sure some people somewhere liked it, but the fact that it currently has above a 3-star rating on Amazon shakes my faith in the amazon review system to my core. I thought this movie was complete garbage. But perhaps I should share my story and my perspective on why this film was so awful.For decades, part of my family's Christmas eve tradition is to go and watch a movie on Christmas eve. In an attempt to get in the spirit of the season, we usually pick a holiday movie. The year that THE FAMILY STONE was released in theaters, it was released during the holidays and it was advertised as a heartwarming family comedy. Expecting to see a funny movie about a family surviving the holidays, we were all duped into making this our Christmas eve movie. My cousins, my brother, my aunt, my uncle, my parents, and my grandparents all went to see it. Imagine our surprise when the movie depicted a very UN-FUNNY, dysfunctional family that spent most of the film fighting in non-humorous ways. The only comedy I actually gleaned from this was my grandparents' running commentary as they tried to understand the plot, especially when they confused the black homosexual boyfriend as the cook. Just to add a cherry on top, Mom (Diane Keaton) appears to have breast cancer; but I don't remember the film telling us that... it mostly just showed a topless, post-mastectomy woman in a love scene. SPOILER ALERT: Mom's not around the following year to celebrate Christmas because she's dead. Happy Holidays!!So, in a nutshell, this was the most depressing, awful holiday movie I've ever seen. I probably wouldn't be reviewing it so harshly, except that it's advertisers marketed it totally inappropriately, intending to trick movie-goers into seeing it! If you are a woman, you'd probably enjoy this movie on some sick, twisted, emotional love/hate-your-mother level. If you're a dude, you will despise this movie and will want to harm anyone involved in making it. If your girlfriend makes you watch it anyway, drink heavily and try not to pay attention. In our country's next armed conflict, we should drop copies of this film on our enemies and wait for them all to commit suicide.ADDENDUM: A commenter indicated that my remarks were largely about how the film was marketed, rather than the content of the film itself. In case my comments above were unclear, I hated it because of the film's plot and because it's marketing tricked me into seeing it. I love virtually all of the actors in this movie, but I'm astonished they signed on for this awful project.

I won't elaborate; enough has been said by other reviewers already.

974587,AVEVNXZGYY2CE,B000EMGJ72,GadgetChick,"[22, 31]","Have you ever had this experience? You see trailers for a movie, realize you like many people in the cast and think the premise is interesting, and eagerly anticipate seeing the movie - only to find out, while you're watching it, that the movie's script would have been better used as a cage liner for an ill-tempered parrot or hamster. Well, that's the experience I had with ""The Family Stone.""The trailers looked so good, didn't they? A great ensemble comedy/drama featuring Sarah Jessica Parker - who doesn't love her? - playing an uptight witch, such a change from her libertine ""Sex and the City"" character. Diane Keaton - I've loved her since I saw her in ""Annie Hall"" as a kid. Rachel McAdams, who was sooo good in ""Wedding Crashers."" Claire Danes, who was every alterna-chick's hero on ""My So-Called Life."" Dermot Mulroney. Craig T. Nelson. Luke Wilson, the thinking girl's heartthrob. Etc. etc. etc.The problem is, the extremely talented cast is beyond wasted in this train wreck of a movie. There are some movies where all of the characters are morally ambiguous and you don't know who to root for, but the movie is still enjoyable because the characters are at least interesting. Not this movie. I kept wishing that the next plot point would be a fatal gas leak that killed every last man, woman and child in the house in either a haze of carbon monoxide or a fiery explosion of mythic proportions.Despite the movie being billed as a comedy, there's very little that's funny here. McAdams and Keaton play characters who you would probably crawl through broken glass or a sewer pipe to avoid. I'm pretty sure their characters should have been portrayed as sitting on a rock somewhere, luring unsuspecting sailors to a grisly death. All the male characters are incredibly weak and come across as morons who follow whichever direction their peter points. Things that would never - I repeat, NEVER - happen in real life, like someone falling in love with their fiancee's sister literally at-first-sight and wanting to marry her instead - are treated like completely reasonable occurrences. There's a painfully unrealistic scene where SJP's character makes a homophobic statement about a family member and a completely histrionic scene ensues. One of the things that struck me about the movie was that no one I have ever encountered would treat a guest in their home the way Keaton's character treats Parker's character - like a leper who's going to dribble  crepulent body parts all over the heirloom Oriental rug. Most people have the common sense and good breeding to gloss over a guest's character flaws or misstatements, but not this family. Anyone different from them is the enemy and will be crucified on the cross of political correctness (I'm a liberal and I thought the political correctness in the movie was over the top).Some very talented people, namely Claire Danes and Craig T. Nelson, are given almost nothing to do. Danes' job is mostly to stand around looking both beautiful and consternated at the same time. Nelson's job is to be the sensitive New Age wimpy dad. There's a pregnant sister in there somewhere, never could figure out what she was supposed to add to the plot other than an additional body at the dinner table. There's a deaf homosexual brother who's adopting a child with his partner and his character has absolutely no depth or complexity; he's basically there as the family's patron saint and a sword for Parker's character to fall upon before redeeming herself by sleeping with her fiance's slacker brother. To top it off, Keaton's character has terminal breast cancer. I presume that was thrown in as a plot device to allow the writers to bring this travesty to some kind of tearjerking end, or to make you feel sorry for her character so you wouldn't dislike her quite so much. Give me a break.All in all, way, WAY too much going on here, and none of it was grounded in reality. This is how a spouseless, childless Hollywood writer envisions Midwestern family life - chaotic and fraught with false-ringing emotional drama. The real dramas that take place in authentic families are way more compelling than this dreck. Heck, my family's annual tussle over the TV remote on Christmas Day is more compelling. I gave the movie two stars because in a twisted way, some parts of it are entertaining. At least more entertaining than watching, say, C-SPAN, or public access. But all in all this movie is terrible, and there are almost certainly better things you could do with your time.

974589,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000EMGJ72,Grady Harp,"[0, 3]","Thomas Bezucha ('Big Eden') is a writer/director willing to address social issues in a setting where the issues become secondary to his characters. Though he is not polished as yet (Big Eden was a fine little film but hardly the credentials to be put in front of a cast a famous actors!), his heart is in the right place and he does have a penchant for finding comedy in the strangest places and allowing the viewer to embrace any of many issues about which he is talking.THE FAMILY STONE is a double play on words: Stone happens to be the name of a very weird and maladapted family finding conflicts blooming at Christmas, but the 'stone' also refers to the wedding ring of the mother's mother which is to be passed to the favorite son upon his engagement. Sybil (Diane Keaton) and Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) are the 'new generation' parents of a family of assorted siblings: pothead Ben (Luke Wilson), angry single Amy (Rachel McAdams), hearing impaired and gay Thad (Tyrone Giordano) partnered with African American Patrick (Brian White), married and pregnant Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), and the poster boy eldest son Everett (Dermot Mulroney). The nidus of the story is Everett bringing uptight/bright/beautiful/critical Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) home for the holiday to announce their engagement. No one likes opinionated Meredith and her uncomfortable 'welcome' triggers maladaptive behavior from everyone. Feeling isolated Meredith invites her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to join her as comfort, an act which opens the family to Julie's warmth and drives Meredith to a night of drinking and letting her hair down with the very mellow Ben. How these incidents intertwine and result in changes in all of the family members is the crux of the story.Along the rocky way Bezucha addresses gay partner infant adoption, fear of relationships, the impact of impending death, following the heart in love instead of the expected route of a family expectations, etc. There are just a few too many subplots to make the film digest well and employing a bit of Keystone Cops slapstick in the kitchen on Christmas morning sort of pushes the overstuffed bird over the edge. Yet with a cast like this the characters, unlikely though they may be, are brought into reality: Parker, Danes, Keaton, Wilson, Nelson, McAdams etc keep things flying.

It's an interesting choice, and probably similiar to what a stranger would feel coming into the home, but it does make things a little more confusing.I found it interesting that a family that was liberal about talking about sex, an unmarried couple sleeping together and accepting of a biracial gay couple adopting was completely intolerant of their oldest son's girlfriend, merely because the spoiled teenage sister says she's uptight.  I had expected humorous incidents, or jokes at the girlfriend's expense, instead it was so mean that I felt mad on her behalf.There is some nice drama, a bit of a message about being yourself and accepting everyone for who they are, etc.  The ending was a bit too pat for me.

After an embarrassing encounter at dinner, Meredith leaves the house, with Ben following her instead of Everett. Instead Everett has become infatuated with Meredith's sister, Julie, who came to lend moral support to her sister, in her time of need.  I found it hard to believe that Julie would NEVER stick up for her sister, even if Meredith put her foot in her mouth.  Also, from Meredith's character, it was  also difficult to believe that she would so easily sway her affection to the brother.To top all of this drama off is a subplot of the mother's returning cancer.  Basically, there was too much in this movie, but it makes for an interesting one time watch.  The acting in this movie is saved by excellent performances from Craig T. Nelson, as the father of the Stone clan, and by Sarah Jessica Parker, as Meredith.My score 2/10.",2,Uneven Movie,1159488000,"09 29, 2006",2006,1460,"['movie', 'had', 'two', 'things', 'going', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson.Everett', 'Stone', 'home', 'girlfriend', 'Meredith', 'Morton', 'meet', 'family', 'Christmas', 'youngest', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'already', 'met', 'Meredith', 'took', 'instant', 'dislike', 'immediately', 'rest', 'family', 'negative', 'things', 'Meredith', 'cause', 'be', 'cold', 'upon', 'arrival', 'ability', 'run', 'mouth', 'say', 'things', 'thinking', 'do', 'not', 'help', 'situation', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'have', 'sympathy', 'Ben', 'boyrfriend', 'brother.The', 'movie', 'focus', 'when', 'plot', 'embarrassing', 'encounter', 'dinner', 'Meredith', 'house', 'Ben', 'following', 'instead', 'Everett', 'Instead', 'Everett', 'become', 'infatuated', 'Meredith', 'sister', 'Julie', 'who', 'came', 'lend', 'moral', 'support', 'sister', 'time', 'need', 'found', 'hard', 'believe', 'Julie', 'would', 'NEVER', 'stick', 'up', 'sister', 'even', 'Meredith', 'put', 'foot', 'mouth', 'Also', 'Meredith', 'character', 'was', 'also', 'difficult', 'believe', 'would', 'so', 'easily', 'sway', 'affection', 'brother.To', 'drama', 'off', 'subplot', 'mother', 'returning', 'cancer', 'Basically', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'interesting', 'one', 'time', 'watch', 'acting', 'movie', 'saved', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'father', 'Stone', 'clan', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Meredith.My', 'score', '2/10']",N/A

It's certainly not bad enough for a one or two star rating, but I found it to definitely have it's problems.1. I found many of the characters to be a little TOO over the top, all extremes of their stereotypes. Meredith played the role of the prudish, tight, ultra conservative, Amy is the messy quick witted liberal college student with a chip on her shoulder, and Sybil is the free thinking liberal mom who supports her children in whatever they do with little moral guidance. There's also the slacker stoner, but surprisingly introspective, brother, and the gay deaf brother in a biracial relationship.2. There seems to be a major identity crisis in this movie. Rewatching the trailer just now, my belief is confirmed that this movie was advertised as a romantic COMEDY, but ends up missing the mark. So if that's what you are expecting--be ye warned. It seemed to try to be both a social commentary/drama and a romantic comedy. In the end, for this particular movie, I didn't find the two to balance out.3. The underlying conflict between conservatism and liberalism is too exaggerated. While at first it seems to serve as a forum to put conservatives in their place, in the end, it's the liberals who get the wrist slap. The whole conflict ends up being too contrived and forced, and both sides seem to be the worst versions of themselves. I find the lack of tact and hospitality shown by the Stone family to be unrealistic and unfair.4. Nothing against Claire Danes or the character of Meredith, but I hate how Meredith is used in the story. Her presence in every scene was just uncomfortable. She came there to give support to her sister, and throughout, did nothing of the sort, and didn't seem to make much attempt to do so.5. This last one is just a bit of a pet peeve.

Within my lifetime, it began with GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER (1967), and continued into recent years with THE BIRDCAGE, DAUGHTER OF DANANG, PIECES OF APRIL, WHAT'S COOKING?, and MEET THE FOKKERS. Now, we have THE FAMILY STONE, for which the scriptwriters crammed in as many potentially discordant elements as possible. At least in the clever WHAT'S COOKING?, multiple dysfunctions surrounding a holiday dinner were spread out among four Los Angeles tribes.Here, uptight Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) brings his even more uptight girlfriend, Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), home to picture-perfect, suburban New England to meet Mom (Diane Keaton) and Dad (Craig Nelson) over Christmas. The gathering of the clan also includes the other Stone children, Amy (Rachel McAdams), Ben (Luke Wilson), Thad (Tyrone Giordano), and Susannah Stone Trousdale (Elizabeth Reaser). As if Meredith's trepidation over meeting the Stones isn't enough, Amy, who's the only other member of the family to have previously met Morton, has already predisposed the others to regard her elder brother's lady with suspicion. Amy has a real attitude problem, exacerbated by the fact that she recently lost her virginity to a paramedic that hasn't been by to see her since. Unsurprisingly, once Everett and Meredith arrive, the latter can't seem to please anybody, and incurs the special enmity of Amy, who has to give up her room to the interloper because Meredith refuses to sleep with Everett in his parents' house (even though the elder Stones seem comfortable with the arrangement). Feeling besieged among strangers, Meredith moves into a local, picture-perfect hotel and calls upon her beautiful, free-spirited sister Julie (Claire Danes) to bus in and be a friendly, supportive presence.You'd think it would be sufficient for a successful and entertaining storyline to have the tightly wound Meredith thrown under the glare of the Stones' critical examination. But, no. Mother Stone is dying of metastatic breast cancer, a secret she's heretofore kept from the kids. In addition, her disapproval of Meredith is strong enough to deny her beloved Everett the use of her mother's antique diamond wedding ring as the engagement band he wants to give to Morton. Then, there's also the subplot involving Thad, who's imported his gay, interracial, lover, Patrick (Brian White) home for the Yule Season, during which they announce their intent to adopt a Black child. And Susannah arrives with her own baggage, young daughter Elizabeth (Savannah Stehlin) and a case of advanced pregnancy; the three are awaiting the arrival of husband and Dad, John Trousdale (Jamie Kaler). Only the mellow Ben, out from laid-back California, seems to have no issues to confront, and, indeed, appears to be the only Stone sympathetic to Meredith's predicament.THE FAMILY STONE is over-scripted and over-populated. Thad, Patrick, Susannah, Elizabeth, and John are completely superfluous. Mom's fatal condition is an unnecessary distraction. (Indeed, as I'm no particular fan of Diane Keaton, her unremarkable performance here simply emphasizes to me that she should retire for good. Annette Bening would've been a better choice for the role.) Finally, as one considers the four single adults  - Everett, Meredith, Julie, and Ben - and the old saw ""opposites attract"", it takes no imagination whatsoever to predict the ultimate evolution of the romantic plot.The best reason to view this film, outside the relief of boredom on a cross-country flight, is to watch Parker go through her paces as the beleaguered outsider that steps in it at every turn; she's good. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this movie as a theater experience at today's admission prices.

974613,AU2V2ZKMZFNY6,B000EMGJ72,"JR Corry ""Jenny""","[1, 1]","*spoilers ahead*Meredith is a staunch conservative who is pretty much engaged to Everett Stone, a great man with a dysfunctional family. When Meredith meets the Stone family, we see she has reason to be uptight: the majority of them are snarky and obnoxious, not to mention nauseatingly politically correct. One of the sons is deaf and gay, attached to a deaf and gay black man (sorry, can't remember all the names). Rachel McAdams plays the worst family member of all, an obnoxious and gossiping redhead with a crude personality to boot. Diane Keaton's character, the mother, appeared in previews to be sweet and easygoing, if a little too enabling. Turns out, she's not: she's just as bitchy and immature as her constantly PMS-ing red-headed daughter. The only difference is that she smiles sweetly when gossiping and verbally slashing another person to bits. An enabler, however, she is to the extreme.Luckily, there are some more gentle members of this nightmare liberal-mania family: the father is far more grounded than his wife, brother Ben Stone is loopy but very friendly, the black son-in-law is far more patient than his anal-retentive partner, there is a very sweet dark-haired daughter (expecting her second child), and Everett, the main one who's dating the uptight Meredith, is a great down-to-earth man who actually has enough balls to tell off his family more than once when they take their snarkiness out on his girlfriend. Seriously, this kind of manliness is missing in a lot of shows and films!I admit, I really did not buy the whole ""obnoxious family is really loving and accepting"" schlock, especially when you add the poor, put upon deaf gay son to boot. Once you get to know the family, however, and see them with BOTH their faults and their redeeming qualities, they become more realistic. Plus, they are NOT allowed to get away with everything. Everett, unlike several weak and enabling male ""heroes"", does not stand by and allow his family to get away with backbiting, nor does the film slip into a ""liberals good, conservatives bad"" trap, which would have been remarkably easy to do. Rather than coming out as the heroic ""open-minded"" family they think they are, they're actually taken to task for their actions: after they openly gang up on Meredith when she clumsily asks politically incorrect questions about the gay couple, they actually realize their mistake and go out of their way to try and apologize to her, including staying up late and worrying when she doesn't come home. Meredith herself is no doormat either: rather than being converted to easy-going liberal-ness and admitting the error of her ways, she tells off the family herself in more than one scene and never takes back her personal feelings or convictions on certain matters. The film very much impressed me with its fairness to both sides of the different characters, as well as the assertiveness given to the lead characters. Plus, it turns out there are deeper issues involved: Diane Keaton's character, the mother, is very sick and worries over what will happen to her family, which explains part of her anger and resentment. The family's vulnerable side was slowly revealed throughout the film, and the empathy and personal struggle for each character transferred the film from potential lopsided comedy to a film of deep family matters.All in all, the film was going splendidly in every way..until the end. If you can believe it, the movie actually did a boyfriend/girlfriend swap, separating Everett and Meredith. Around the middle of the film, Meredith's sister Julie arrives, to help her out. After the initial interaction between Meredith's free-for-all happy sis and the family's adoration of her, of course, it becomes apparent Julie really has no place whatsoever in the story except to take Everett from Meredith. And who does Meredith end up with? Ben Stone, the goofy brother, of all people. Ahh..no. No, no! Everett and Julie I can almost buy, but Ben and Meredith? That match is so bad, it gives me a reaction almost as bad as the one I have when colors clash: ickk! Of all ridiculous, random things! And no, nobody steals anyone's man; Julie isn't heartless. The mis-matches happen ""naturally"" and everyone's satisfied at the end, after the initial mess that ensues after Meredith's PC faux pas disaster at the dinner table (after she flees is when the mis-matches begin to fall into place).The switching of couples is what stole this movie's five-star rating for me; other than this baaad, bad move, the movie's actually pretty darn good. The Stone's are realistically revealed as a good family, who learns to accept a very different person and even ask forgiveness from her when they wrong her, while she likewise learns to adapt to and care for them.

The family take an instant dislike to her and the harder she tries to please them, the more they dislike her.  Eventually she asks her sister to come for the holidays, and then things become really complicated.  I will try to be fair about this movie and first list the positives.  The cast is very appealing, especially matriatch Diane Keaton, and the snow scenes are really pretty.  Now for the negatives--the script is often pretty bad(""I dreamed you were shoveling the snow and I was the snow"") and the situations become about as likely as a snowball in Havana.  Sarah Jessica Parker's character has mood swings that begin to grate after awhile.  One minute she's an uptight business woman, the next she's a drunken flirt, and the next she's snuggling up to her prospective brother-in-law.  This movie has an identity crisis and can't decide if it's comedy or tragedy, so one minute it's full of pathos and the next, it's slapstick.  It's slow in the beginning and just plain ridiculous towards the end.  It is so trite that I was predicting the plot turns before they happened and reciting the lines before the actors did.

974618,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,B000EMGJ72,Katie,"[37, 57]","First off we have Sarah Jessica Parker, whose tight hair is supposed to signify that she is uptight.  Sort of like how in She's All That Rachel Leigh Cooke's overalls, braids, and glasses are supposed to signify that she's nerdy and ugly.  And, like with Rachel, with Sarah we just don't buy it.Not that she doesn't do a good job acting.  The problem is that she doesn't have much to work with.  None of them do.  Which is a darn shame, because the cast has Rachel McAdams and Luke Wilson. The family is incredibly, incredibly mean and nasty.  I found Sarah's character, Meredith, a sweet girl who was just trying so hard to make a good impression.  But guess what, she's an uptight conservative and they're a free-spirited, liberal New England family!  UH OH I smell a sitcom!  Or more like a crappy holiday film.The Stone family are just a bunch of caricatures who are drawn to the extreme not only making them wholey unrealistic but also downright psychotic.  Their behavior towards Meredith is downright nasty, not something that IMO makes for comedy.  When they chased her out into her car for making some debatably-true but not-*gasp*-pc remarks about homosexuality I was almost crying along with her.  The mother is the worst, refusing to give her son a wedding ring just because the girl shares different values than she does.Oh, but then the script writer tries to explain the mother's hostility by giving her cancer.  What type of cancer?  Who cares enough to find out?  It's the most halfwitted effort ever to pull some heartstrings.  And I've heard ""Christmas Shoes.""  At that point I wanted Mrs. Stone to die a painful death, so I wasn't really upset by that despite all of the sad images of her set to Judy Garland singing.As I said, they're all a bunch of caricatures.  Rachel McAdams PMSes for no reason, Luke Wilson is this stoner who doesn't give a crap about anything, there's the other sister whose name I can't even remember because she's so pointless, and Claire Danes who is like a ""cool"" version of Sarah Jessica Parker's character.  Oh please.  And don't even get me started on the saintly gay brother.  Ever seen RENT?  Know Angel?  It's EXACTLY like that.  Not one flaw about him.  And in the ultimate show that the Stones are UBER ACCEPTING AND LIBERAL, he's dating a black guy.  Wow, I'm *so* impressed.And of course, they can't change for Meredith, heaven forbid, because the uptight conservative always has to let her hair down--literally--and relax.  And Meredith stays in the family, only with Luke Wilson instead.  Meredith's former boyfriend whose name I can't remember hooks up with Claire Danes after, I kid you not, one conversation.  Greaat.My sister and mom loved this movie.  I did not.  I look more more than character torture, cheap emotional manipulation and cardboard cutout characters, but maybe that's just me.

974622,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000EMGJ72,Kevin Killian,"[2, 8]","With such a 70s oriented soundtrack would it have hurt them to actually use something by Sly and the Family Stone instead of just name-checking them in the title?  We think of SATSF as the model for a multi-racial, integrated ensemble blending R&B;, rock and funk, and I suppose THE FAMILY STONE qualifies by including one black fellow into their extended family of schemers and backbiters.  It's great that young black actors are getting work, but all Brian White gets to do is look offended when, trying to succeed at a game of charades, Sarah Jessica Parker points to him as ""Word Four"" in her round which is, ""THE BRIDE WORE BLACK.""  Oops.  Poor Brian White had so much street cred owing to his longrunning part as ""Tavon"" on TV's THE SHIELD, and then playing in the ensemble cast of the movie BRICK, and besides that he is actually the son of Jo Jo White so, as far as I'm concerned, he is dynasty royalty, and yet there he is, acting offended as the boyfriend of the deaf son Thad whom everybody loves.The casting people did a great job I thought of making the children all look reasonably alike, as though they might have come from the same family; there was a strong resemblance among Rachel McAdams, Dermot Mulroney, and the woman who played the other sister who was pregnant.  Fine.  But where did they get that deaf son.  Did they adopt him from some orphanage in Sicily?  He looks like Dondi from the oldtime comic strip, or maybe a little bit like Russ Tamblyn in West Side Story.  No way he was the son of uberwasps Craig Nelson and Diane Keaton.  Maybe there's a back story there.  It's the kind of movie that you know had fifty scenes that had to be deleted when they decided to turn it into a feature after planning it as a episodic miniseries.  Why even have the little girl in it at all?  Just to break Sarah Jessica Parker's shoes?And if I was Sarah Jessica, I'd approach the project somewhat differently.  Yes, I'd pat myself on the back for taking a part which had me playing uptight and unlikeable at the beginning, but I would never agree to playing uptight and unlikeable by slicking my hair back so severely that all the muscles in my neck pop out and you can see both sides of my face in profile like a Picasso!  I would just step in and say to the director, quietly, please cut out all my scenes until I get drunk and let my hair down.

This film is much more somber than one would expect from looking at the trailers.  Newly engaged Everett (Dermot Mulroney) and Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) travel to Everett's family home for the holidays to announce their engagement and allow Meredith to ""meet the parents.""  The visit doesn't turn out as expected with Meredith being grilled and disliked by most of Everett's family, and Everett realizing that not everyone sees in his fiance what he does.If you're a Sex and the City fan and are secretly hoping to get one last glimpse of Carrie, you will be even more let down.  Sarah Jessica Parker's character is an overly neurotic, narcissistic, self-absorbed, spoiled brat who is so focused on what her fiance's family will think of her that she can't even take the time to relax and let her real self shine through.  The only moment we even get a glimpse of what this girl might be like behind closed doors is after she runs out of a family meeting to get drunk and stoned with her fiance's brother (Luke Wilson, in perhaps the one saving grace of this film).  Instead of sucking it up and trying harder to be herself, Parker calls her sister (Claire Danes) to come to the holiday dinner and try to pick up the pieces.I thought this movie was okay, but barely so and only because I didn't have that big a problem with the bait and switch technique used in the trailers and marketing.  You can't market a film filled with many depressing and somber elements as a fun, lighthearted romantic comedy where everyone is laughing and having a good time.

""Kimberly""","[3, 8]","""The Family Stone"" surprised me I intially saw it thinking it would be one of those typical snooze fest movies made by hollywood-one that relys on name appeal and does not have a proper story to match. To my surprise the ""The Family Stone"" was funny, un-believable sweet, and heartbreaking at times.It's one of the best Christmas movies I have seen since ""A Christmas Story"" and ranks among ""It's A Wonderful Life"" on the meaning of family and love. Like most holiday films this movie focuses on family- except this family is eccentric group led and nutured by their mother Diane Lane's character.The family stone consists of 3 sons and 2 daughters- all with their own quirks and ambitions. Overall the family looks and acts like yours- they argue at times, chase eachother, joke about one another, but, the geniunely love and care for one another. The characters are an interesting mix match- but their spouses/love interests are what make this movie hillarous.The story begins as Garret Stone is bringing his girlfriend Meredith(Sarah Jessica Parker) the ultra-conservative, reserved and well-mannered woman to meet his family at their annual family Christmas get-together... Garrett plans on asking his mother for his grandmother's wedding ring to propose to Meredith.Only problem is Garrett's family hates the reserved Meredith and wants her gone- which makes for a hillarity of Christmas mishaps with the family Stone. The family is going through a tough adjustment-their mother/root of their dysfunctional family is dying... which may explain why this Christmas has to be JUST perfect. Throw into the mix a couple of surprise relationships that begin to bloom- we learn family togetherness is the only option to survive in this family.All in all this is one of those movies YOU have to see and sadly is a forgotten gem among this years titans-""King Kong"", ""Brokeback Mountain""...etc. I really enjoyed this movie it made me laugh and cry at times. But, more important that it made me wish that my own family was like the family Stone- where family togetherness and love lasts all year long not just at Christmas.

When it was first released, I could not pass this up because of Tyrone Giordano.  Ty is a fellow Gallaudetian.  Since then, I've seen it a few times and the movie has not lost its magic.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Meredith Morton, who is an uptight nervous wreck.  She is being brought to her boyfriend's family home for Christmas.  Her boyfriend is Everett Stone, the eldest son who is running for mayor.To Meredith, she is in another world when she enters the Stones' residence.  She feels out of place as the Stones are laid-back and ""huggy-feely"".  However, the family are not quite receptive to Meredith.This particular Christmas is different because every member of the family has come home with their own personal secret or struggle.  Kelly (Nelson) and Sybil (Keaton) are going through a health issue together.  Amy (McAdams) is going through the blues, especially yearning for a guy that she hasn't had contact for over a year.  Susannah (Reaser) comes home with her daughter for Christmas and avoids any discussion about her husband.  The only ""sane kids"" are pot-smoking Ben (Wilson) and Thad (Giordano) and his Black partner, Patrick (White).Of course, things go crazy as soon as Meredith joins the Stones for Christmas.  Everett is interesting because he seems to defend Meredith at some points but then he'll throw her ""to the lions"" at her own expense.  To survive Christmas, Meredith has called out her sister, Julie (Danes), to join her.  To make matter interesting (or worse, depending on your take), Ben takes an interest in Meredith while Everett takes an interest in Julie.What makes this movie even more endearing is that the whole family incorporates sign language with their Deaf son/brother/partner, Thad.  He is included in conversations and other family matters.  He is what the Deaf would say that he is ""one of the few lucky Deaf people"" to have a family that sign with him.  Honestly, most Deaf people are left isolated by their hearing family members because they do not sign.  Therefore, the Deaf member are left on their own or they're out with Deaf friends.Just as things go crazy, the Stones tackle each issue one by one just in time for Christmas.  *The Family Stone* is a wonderful romantic comedy.  There is also a couple of moments that are going to make you cry.

974635,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000EMGJ72,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 4]","I watched ""The Family Stone"" with some trepidation because while I knew it had this great ensemble cast the trailer made it clear that this holiday film was going to go to engage in one of my least favorite romantic plots.  That would be where Person A is engaged to Person B and brings them home to meet the family, a which point Person B will fall for Person C, who is the sibling of Person A.  In this Person A would be Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney), Person B would be his fiance, Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Person B would be Everett's brother, Ben (Luke Wilson).  I just think of my brother and I being the siblings in such a story and all I can think is that it would be the end of the world as we know it.  A story like ""Moonstruck"" pushes me about as far as I can go along these lines.  Fortunately, ""The Family Stone,"" is about more than this plot line.One of those things is also clear from the trailer.  When Everett brings Meredith home to meet the family, the Stones do not like her.  True, Meredith is wound way too tight, but Everett's sister Amy (Rachel McAdams) poisons the well before the couple arrives because Meredith clears her throat when she is nervous.  The matriarch of the family, Sybil (Diane Keaton) is horrified by the thought that Everett will ask for her mother's wedding ring to give to Meredith.  Even the family's black sheep, Ben, who seems to be the only one who does not have a problem with Meredith, blithely announces the two do not love each other.  It is Kelly (Craig T. Nelson), the father, who points out Meredith does not trust herself.  However, this conclusion does not persuade anybody to treat her any differently.  So I was worried that the arc of the film predicted by the trailer would play itself out.Fortunately, there is something the trailer does not give away that adds pathos to the proceedings.  The insults and the slapstick do not end up being the most memorable part of ""The Family Stone,"" at least not for me (which is fine, because I hate it when trailers have all of the best gags of a movie, something that is happening way too frequently this century).  Writer-director Thomas Bezucha, whose only previous credit is ""Early May,"" really lets Meredith dig her own grave quite a bit here, but he also gives her a moment of redemption when she does one thing right.  More importantly, when we get to the end of the movie, Bezucha does not make us cry.  He lets us cry.As mentioned previously, the ensemble cast is pretty impressive.  The rest of the Stone family consists of another daughter, Susannah Stone Trousdale (Elizabeth Reaser), who is expecting her second child, another son, Thad (Tyrone Giordano), and Thad's partner, Patrick Thomas (Brian White).  Thad is gay, but more importantly he is deaf, and one of the defining characteristic of the family is that they tend to sign as they speak, even if Thad is not around.  All Meredith has on her side is her sister, Julie (Claire Danes), called in when fleeing the Stone house for a local inn proves insufficient.  There are some funny slapstick moments in this one, but the idea this 2005 film was a screwball comedy is ludicrous.  This one has a lot more heart than that.",4,Fortunately the trailer does not give away why this holiday film works,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,3212,"['watched', 'Family', 'Stone', 'trepidation', 'knew', 'had', 'great', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'trailer', 'made', 'clear', 'holiday', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'engage', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'romantic', 'plots', 'would', 'be', 'where', 'Person', 'A', 'engaged', 'Person', 'B', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'point', 'Person', 'B', 'will', 'fall', 'Person', 'C', 'who', 'sibling', 'Person', 'A', 'Person', 'A', 'would', 'be', 'Everett', 'Stone', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Person', 'B', 'would', 'be', 'fiance', 'Meredith', 'Morton', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Person', 'B', 'would', 'be', 'Everett', 'brother', 'Ben', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'just', 'think', 'brother', 'being', 'siblings', 'such', 'story', 'can', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'A', 'story', 'Moonstruck', 'as', 'far', 'can', 'go', 'lines', 'Fortunately', 'Family', 'Stone', 'more', 'plot', 'line.One', 'things', 'also', 'clear', 'trailer', 'When', 'Everett', 'Meredith', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'Stones', 'do', 'not', 'True', 'Meredith', 'wound', 'way', 'too', 'tight', 'Everett', 'sister', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'well', 'couple', 'Meredith', 'throat', 'when', 'nervous', 'matriarch', 'family', 'Sybil', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'horrified', 'thought', 'Everett', 'will', 'ask', 'mother', 'wedding', 'ring', 'give', 'Meredith', 'Even', 'family', 'black', 'sheep', 'Ben', 'who', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'not', 'have', 'problem', 'Meredith', 'blithely', 'two', 'do', 'not', 'love', 'other', 'Kelly', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'father', 'who', 'out', 'Meredith', 'not', 'trust', 'However', 'conclusion', 'not', 'persuade', 'anybody', 'treat', 'differently', 'was', 'worried', 'arc', 'film', 'predicted', 'trailer', 'would', 'play', 'out.Fortunately', 'something', 'trailer', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'pathos', 'proceedings', 'insults', 'slapstick', 'do', 'not', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'Family', 'Stone', 'least', 'not', 'fine', 'hate', 'when', 'trailers', 'have', 'best', 'gags', 'movie', 'something', 'happening', 'way', 'too', 'frequently', 'century', 'Writer-director', 'Thomas', 'Bezucha', 'only', 'previous', 'credit', 'Early', 'May', 'really', 'Meredith', 'dig', 'own', 'grave', 'quite', 'bit', 'here', 'also', 'moment', 'redemption', 'when', 'one', 'thing', 'right', 'More', 'importantly', 'when', 'get', 'end', 'movie', 'Bezucha', 'not', 'make', 'cry', 'cry.As', 'mentioned', 'previously', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'rest', 'Stone', 'family', 'daughter', 'Susannah', 'Stone', 'Trousdale', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'who', 'expecting', 'second', 'child', 'son', 'Thad', 'Tyrone', 'Giordano', 'Thad', 'partner', 'Patrick', 'Thomas', 'Brian', 'White', 'Thad', 'gay', 'more', 'importantly', 'deaf', 'one', 'defining', 'characteristic', 'family', 'tend', 'sign', 'speak', 'even', 'Thad', 'not', 'around', 'Meredith', 'side', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'called', 'when', 'fleeing', 'Stone', 'house', 'local', 'inn', 'insufficient', 'are', 'funny', 'slapstick', 'moments', 'one', 'idea', '2005', 'film', 'was', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'ludicrous', 'one', 'lot', 'more', 'heart']",N/A

974656,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000EMGJ72,Melissa Niksic,"[6, 9]","This movie was not properly advertised. The trailers for ""The Family Stone"" made the film out to be a holiday screwball comedy with an impressive ensemble cast. In reality, it's a GREAT holiday movie with an OUTSTANDING ensemble cast, but it's not really a comedy at all...more of a family ""dramedy"" that's very bittersweet and is a truly EXCELLENT film.""The Family Stone"" is set at the New England home of Kelly and Sybil Stone (Craig T. Nelson and Diane Keaton). All the children arrive to spend the holidays together as a family. There's Everett (Dermot Mulroney), the polished and successful firstborn son; Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), a traditional wife and mother; Ben (Luke Wilson), the relaxed and laid back guy; Thad (Ty Giordano), who happens to be gay and deaf; and Amy (Rachel McAdams), the smart-mouthed rebel.  Everett brings his girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) home to meet his family, and things start to fall apart the moment she walks in the door. Amy has already prepared her family to expect the worst from the uptight, aggressive Meredith, and everything that could possibly go wrong DOES.To make matters more complicated, Everett intends to propose to Meredith on Christmas day, and he pressures Sybil to hand over her mother's wedding ring, the ""family stone"" that she had promised to give to her oldest son's future wife. Like the rest of the family, Sybil hasn't exactly warmed to Meredith, and she has her own personal reasons for wanting to try and preserve her son's happiness. In the midst of all this chaos, Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes) arrives, throwing another curveball at the family during their quest for a merry Christmas.The casting for this movie is perfect. Everyone in the film does an amazing job, but the real stars are the two leading ladies. Sarah Jessica Parker is endearing and also comical in a role that is as far removed from Carrie Bradshaw as can be. (""Um, are those mushrooms?"" ""I didn't KNOOOOOW!"") Diane Keaton is delightful as the family matriarch: hysterically funny, elegant, and touching.Yes, this movie is kind of clich&eacute; in spots. It wasn't hard to figure out that Sybil had been diagnosed with a terminal illness or that Meredith would end up with Ben and that Everett would end up with Julie. However, Christmas in itself is full of clich&eacute;s, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that, so that aspect of the movie didn't bother me. I didn't think that Parker and Wilson had any on-screen chemistry, so I had a hard time buying into Meredith and Ben's relationship. I was also disappointed that Julie was such a one-dimensional character. Claire Danes is a very talented actress and everyone else in the movie had these great characters to work with, but all Julie really did was stand around tossing her long blonde hair and looking cute. It got annoying after a while.Overall, though, ""The Family Stone"" is an excellent movie about the importance and endurance of family. It will make you laugh and it will also make you cry (I was SOBBING when I left the theatre!).",4,A holiday gem,1134777600,"12 17, 2005",2005,3067,"['movie', 'was', 'not', 'properly', 'advertised', 'trailers', 'Family', 'Stone', 'made', 'film', 'be', 'holiday', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'impressive', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'reality', 'GREAT', 'holiday', 'movie', 'OUTSTANDING', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'not', 'really', 'comedy', 'more', 'family', 'dramedy', 'very', 'bittersweet', 'truly', 'EXCELLENT', 'film', 'Family', 'Stone', 'set', 'New', 'England', 'home', 'Kelly', 'Sybil', 'Stone', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'children', 'arrive', 'spend', 'holidays', 'together', 'family', 'Everett', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'polished', 'successful', 'firstborn', 'son', 'Susannah', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'traditional', 'wife', 'mother', 'Ben', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'relaxed', 'laid', 'back', 'guy', 'Thad', 'Ty', 'Giordano', 'who', 'be', 'gay', 'deaf', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'smart-mouthed', 'rebel', 'Everett', 'girlfriend', 'Meredith', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'things', 'start', 'fall', 'apart', 'moment', 'door', 'Amy', 'already', 'prepared', 'family', 'expect', 'worst', 'uptight', 'aggressive', 'Meredith', 'everything', 'could', 'possibly', 'go', 'wrong', 'DOES.To', 'make', 'matters', 'more', 'complicated', 'Everett', 'propose', 'Meredith', 'Christmas', 'day', 'Sybil', 'hand', 'mother', 'wedding', 'ring', 'family', 'stone', 'had', 'promised', 'give', 'oldest', 'son', 'future', 'wife', 'rest', 'family', 'Sybil', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'warmed', 'Meredith', 'own', 'personal', 'reasons', 'wanting', 'try', 'preserve', 'son', 'happiness', 'midst', 'chaos', 'Meredith', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'throwing', 'curveball', 'family', 'quest', 'merry', 'Christmas.The', 'casting', 'movie', 'perfect', 'Everyone', 'film', 'amazing', 'job', 'real', 'stars', 'are', 'two', 'leading', 'ladies', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'endearing', 'also', 'comical', 'role', 'far', 'removed', 'Carrie', 'Bradshaw', 'can', 'be', 'Um', 'are', 'mushrooms', 'did', ""n't"", 'KNOOOOOW', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'delightful', 'family', 'matriarch', 'hysterically', 'funny', 'elegant', 'touching.Yes', 'movie', 'kind', 'clich', 'eacute', 'spots', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'figure', 'out', 'Sybil', 'had', 'been', 'diagnosed', 'terminal', 'illness', 'Meredith', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'Ben', 'Everett', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'Julie', 'However', 'Christmas', 'full', 'clich', 'eacute', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'aspect', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Parker', 'Wilson', 'had', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'buying', 'Meredith', 'Ben', 'relationship', 'was', 'also', 'disappointed', 'Julie', 'was', 'such', 'one-dimensional', 'character', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'very', 'talented', 'actress', 'everyone', 'else', 'movie', 'had', 'great', 'characters', 'work', 'Julie', 'really', 'did', 'was', 'stand', 'around', 'tossing', 'long', 'blonde', 'hair', 'looking', 'cute', 'got', 'annoying', 'while.Overall', 'though', 'Family', 'Stone', 'excellent', 'movie', 'importance', 'endurance', 'family', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'cry', 'was', 'SOBBING', 'when', 'left', 'theatre']",N/A

But somehow this film takes on more ""gravitas"" in one's mind as time goes by. Or maybe that is just me. Anyway, I liked THE FAMILY STONE. Who hasn't felt the odd man out at a picnic or party or family gathering? So there is an immediate empathy for Meredith played by Sarah jessica Parker, who is spending the Christmas holidays with her fiance's family. Meredith is a conservative soul thrown into a liberal family which has a gay, deaf son and another pot-smoking son. Meredith, honestly but perhaps blunderingly, manages to espouse a view that the family considers a criticism of the gay lifestyle and it is all downhill from there. Meredith brings in moral support in the form of her attractive sister Julie (Claire Danes) who immediately catches the eye of Meredith's fiance Everett (Dermot Mulroney) and the complications multiply. One wants to side with poor Meredith who is half-heartedly supported by her fiance against the rest of the family. But I guess part of the purpose of these gatherings with new fiances is to test the family waters.

Parker, Rachel McAdams, and a guy I've always admired, Craig T. Nelson).  It seemed like it might be  an updated ""Meet the Fokkers"" -- I was expecting a predictable-but-fun mix of family quirkiness, silly laughs, implausible-but-amusing plot twists, and so on.  In short, I was ready to be entertained (isn't that what movies, created by the so-called ""entertainment industry"", are supposed to do?).  Instead, what I got was a topsy-turvy roller coaster ride that was at times an attempt at humor, at times a clumsy (and correspondingly annoying) display of liberal preaching on any of a number of social topics including homosexuality, family relationships, and intolerance, but most of the time just a BAD MOVIE, never quite deciding whether or not it was trying to be a comedy, a sermon, a drama, or just an infomercial (and a boring one at that) on the merits of liberalism.  Ironically, the liberal and tolerant views espoused by all were in direct contrast with the rampant fire-breathing intolerance (even cruelty) shown by these same characters towards their Christmas houseguest (the S. J. Parker character, the only one who managed to evoke any sympathy whatsoever).  All the members of the family were so downright unlikeable and one-dimensional, that not even the mother's tragic breast cancer side-plot managed to evoke any viewer sympathy whatsoever.

Amy(Rachel McAdams) the youngest Stone sibling hates her. Sybil(Diane Keaton) the mother thinks Everret could do better as does his father Kelley(Craig T.Nelson). His brother Ben(Luke Wilson) likes Meredith in a way he shouldn't while Everett's other brother Thad(Tyrone Giordano) is gay and hoping to adopt a baby with his life partner Patrick(Brian J. White). The last Stone sibling is the very pregnant Susannah(Elizabeth Reaser). Needless to say Meredith is out numbered by Everett's family and their rude behavior towards her so she invites her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come and be her support but Julie ends up falling for Everett. But underneath the Stone family rudeness is a soft spot and a big secret. The mother is dying.Maybe it was just me but I felt Julie and Everett's romance along with Meredith and Ben's was a little rushed. Also they should have shown the mother's death instead of skipping ahead to the next year. All in all it was an okay film.Penny Lane,3,Good comedy,1148169600,"05 21, 2006",2006,1368,"['movie', 'was', 'good', 'comedy', 'yes', 'had', 'sad', 'moments', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'well', 'felt', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'Maybe', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'portrayed', 'left', 'gaps.But', 'general', 'plot', 'story', 'Everett', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'soon', 'be', 'wife', 'Meredith', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'met', 'very', 'unpleasant', 'behavior', 'Amy', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'youngest', 'Stone', 'sibling', 'Sybil', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'mother', 'Everret', 'could', 'do', 'better', 'father', 'Kelley', 'Craig', 'T.Nelson', 'brother', 'Ben', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'Meredith', 'way', 'should', ""n't"", 'while', 'Everett', 'other', 'brother', 'Thad', 'Tyrone', 'Giordano', 'gay', 'hoping', 'adopt', 'baby', 'life', 'partner', 'Patrick', 'Brian', 'J', 'White', 'last', 'Stone', 'sibling', 'very', 'pregnant', 'Susannah', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'Needless', 'say', 'Meredith', 'out', 'numbered', 'Everett', 'family', 'rude', 'behavior', 'towards', 'sister', 'Julie', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'come', 'be', 'support', 'Julie', 'up', 'falling', 'Everett', 'Stone', 'family', 'rudeness', 'soft', 'spot', 'big', 'secret', 'mother', 'was', 'just', 'felt', 'Julie', 'Everett', 'romance', 'Meredith', 'Ben', 'was', 'little', 'rushed', 'Also', 'should', 'have', 'shown', 'mother', 'death', 'instead', 'skipping', 'ahead', 'next', 'year', 'was', 'okay', 'film.Penny', 'Lane']",N/A

Nothing but ultra liberal, whining, PC, babies that are more unforgiving than any I have ever seen. Seriously! They are just completely intolerable of this woman whom they all just met and absolutely deconstruct and tear apart every comment she makes. No matter how innocent or trivial. For just meeting someone who your son/brother is supposedly madly in love with, they truly treat this lady like trash.The plot is terrifyingly horrid as well and has the family just sleeping around with anyone and everyone. They even throw in a little brother, sister partner swopping for good measure. No joke! The family even openly jokes and mocks their own younger sister about her first sexual experience. Here's for keeping private matters private. Combine this with some trite writing which takes all the mentally draining comments and harsh bullying between Sarah Jessica Parker's character and the family and simply wraps it up into a neat package in one heart-wrenching scene. Where Sarah Jessica Parker finally confronts the family about their attitude towards her, slips onto the floor while holding onto some casserole which spills everywhere, they all have a good laugh and suddenly become accepting of one another.

However, it failed to fulfill my hopes.  It had some funny moments in it (one of which for me, was not the kitchen fridge scene) that saved it.  And it had some very touching moments in it too.  Between some of the funny and some of touching, there was a reason for me to finish the movie.It's the story of a son, who brings his Type A personality to the extreme girlfriend home, for his whole family (two sisters and two brothers) to meet for the very first time, during the Christmas holiday.  Little does his family know, which they soon discover, that he plans on proposing to her, when he requests the heirloom ring from his mother.

I have to say that I wish I had heeded the reviews of critics and friends and seen something else instead.The basic problem with the film is essentially the script.  Or perhaps what the director did with the script.  But whatever the cause, the result is an uninteresting film about largely unlikable characters.  The film collects a group of dull and negative characters for your basic Christmas holiday movie.  Dermot Mulrooney is taking his girlfriend Sarah Jessica Parker home for the holidays, hoping while there to propose to her.  Unfortunately, the entire family takes an immediate dislike to her, as does the audience.  Of course, none of the family members are likable either.  The only person who likes Parker is brother Luke Wilson, and as soon as I heard that her sister was coming to visit her to console her for how miserably she has been received by her boyfriend's family, I figured there was going to be some sort of girlfriend/boyfriend swap, with Parker ending up with Wilson and Mulrooney ending up with the sister, played by Claire Danes.  I won't say how it ends, but I did mention that this was an intensely predictable picture, didn't I?Sometimes a film with weak characters and an overwhelmingly predictable plot can be overcome to a degree by an assemblage of good moments.  Unfortunately, most of the individual moments are pretty tedious as well.  There are, in fact, a host of very uncomfortable, unpleasant moments.  Even the intended feel-good moment closing the film didn't feel so good.  All of the people involved in this film have made better films in the past and will almost certainly make better ones in the future.  But I doubt if any of them are in such a drab movie with such an otherwise strong cast.Don't do as I did and see this despite all the negative reviews.  It really is pretty awful.

Nelson, Rachel McAdams, Clair Danes, Dermot Mulroney, Sarah Jessica Parker and Luke Wilson, I never believed for a moment that the characters in ""The Family Stone"" were ever related to one another in any way whatsoever.  Both they and the story they are involved in feel like the products of a Screenwriting 101 workshop, with all the realism and believability one would expect from such an enterprise.Keaton and Nelson are Sybil and Everett Stone, the parents of five grown children who have all gathered to celebrate one final Christmas together in the parents' idyllic Connecticut home before Sybil passes away from cancer.  Each of the siblings has an ""idiosyncrasy"" stamped onto his or her persona with all the subtlety of a cattle brand.  Everett (Mulroney), the stuffed-shirt perfectionist, has brought a woman home with him to meet the family - a rigid, equally uptight woman from The City named Meredith (Parker).  The family takes an immediate disliking to her and wastes no time in trying to sabotage her chances with their darling son/brother - though why they don't see that Everett and Meredith are actually perfectly suited for one another is just one of the many head-scratching implausibilities that make up this script.  Most of the film is spent with Meredith trying desperately to ingratiate herself with the nasty brood while the family worries about the impending loss of their wife and mother, and several of the children participate in a roundelay of romantic musical chairs more appropriate to a bunch of prepubescent adolescents than supposed adults in their twenties and thirties.As a family, the Stones are not so much dysfunctional as they are simply annoying.  Insufferably smug, petty and self-righteous, the Stones are models of tolerance only when it comes to their own in-group apparently - being highly supportive of their deaf gay son/brother and his black partner, for instance - but they are far less inclined to extend that same courtesy to those unfortunate enough to be trapped outside the family circle.  Frankly, after their nauseating mistreatment of Meredith, I couldn't figure out why she didn't just tell them all to go to hell, hightail it on out of there, and go spend Christmas with people who might actually like her and treat her like a genuine human being.To add insult to injury, the movie exploits the issue of terminal illness in an effort to lend unearned weight to what is otherwise a hopelessly contrived, unflaggingly trivial and utterly unconvincing family drama.  The script hits its low point in a ridiculous, badly staged slapstick scene involving various family members slipping and sliding across the linoleum after the family's holiday meal somehow lands on the kitchen floor (don`t even ask).  Not even a flavorful, touching coda can wipe away the bitter taste of much of what occurs earlier on in the film.For a much better variation on this theme of an outsider trying to batter her way into an exclusive family circle, check out the far superior ""Junebug"" and skip this lump of Christmas coal altogether.",2,a lump of Christmas coal,1165449600,"12 7, 2006",2006,3160,"['*spoilers*Despite', 'presence', 'actors', 'less', 'stellar', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Craig', 'T.', 'Nelson', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'Clair', 'Danes', 'Dermot', 'Mulroney', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'never', 'believed', 'moment', 'characters', 'Family', 'Stone', 'were', 'ever', 'related', 'one', 'way', 'whatsoever', 'story', 'are', 'involved', 'feel', 'products', 'Screenwriting', '101', 'workshop', 'realism', 'believability', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'such', 'enterprise.Keaton', 'Nelson', 'are', 'Sybil', 'Everett', 'Stone', 'parents', 'five', 'grown', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'gathered', 'celebrate', 'one', 'final', 'Christmas', 'together', 'parents', 'idyllic', 'Connecticut', 'home', 'Sybil', 'away', 'cancer', 'siblings', 'idiosyncrasy', 'stamped', 'persona', 'subtlety', 'cattle', 'brand', 'Everett', 'Mulroney', 'stuffed-shirt', 'perfectionist', 'brought', 'woman', 'home', 'meet', 'family', 'rigid', 'equally', 'uptight', 'woman', 'City', 'named', 'Meredith', 'Parker', 'family', 'immediate', 'disliking', 'time', 'trying', 'sabotage', 'chances', 'darling', 'son/brother', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Everett', 'Meredith', 'are', 'actually', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'one', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'head-scratching', 'implausibilities', 'make', 'up', 'script', 'Most', 'film', 'spent', 'Meredith', 'trying', 'desperately', 'ingratiate', 'nasty', 'brood', 'family', 'impending', 'loss', 'wife', 'mother', 'several', 'children', 'participate', 'roundelay', 'romantic', 'musical', 'chairs', 'more', 'appropriate', 'bunch', 'prepubescent', 'adolescents', 'supposed', 'adults', 'twenties', 'thirties.As', 'family', 'Stones', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'dysfunctional', 'are', 'simply', 'annoying', 'Insufferably', 'smug', 'petty', 'self-righteous', 'Stones', 'are', 'models', 'tolerance', 'only', 'when', 'own', 'in-group', 'apparently', 'being', 'highly', 'supportive', 'deaf', 'gay', 'son/brother', 'black', 'partner', 'instance', 'are', 'far', 'less', 'inclined', 'extend', 'same', 'courtesy', 'unfortunate', 'enough', 'be', 'trapped', 'family', 'circle', 'Frankly', 'nauseating', 'mistreatment', 'Meredith', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'tell', 'go', 'hell', 'hightail', 'go', 'spend', 'Christmas', 'people', 'who', 'might', 'actually', 'treat', 'genuine', 'human', 'being.To', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'movie', 'issue', 'terminal', 'illness', 'effort', 'lend', 'unearned', 'weight', 'what', 'otherwise', 'hopelessly', 'contrived', 'unflaggingly', 'trivial', 'utterly', 'unconvincing', 'family', 'drama', 'script', 'low', 'point', 'ridiculous', 'badly', 'staged', 'slapstick', 'scene', 'involving', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'slipping', 'sliding', 'linoleum', 'family', 'holiday', 'meal', 'somehow', 'lands', 'kitchen', 'floor', 'don', 't', 'even', 'ask', 'Not', 'even', 'flavorful', 'touching', 'coda', 'can', 'wipe', 'away', 'bitter', 'taste', 'much', 'what', 'earlier', 'film.For', 'much', 'better', 'variation', 'theme', 'outsider', 'trying', 'batter', 'way', 'exclusive', 'family', 'circle', 'check', 'out', 'far', 'superior', 'Junebug', 'skip', 'lump', 'Christmas', 'coal', 'altogether']",N/A
974696,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,B000EMGJ72,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[24, 36]","It's not really funny, nor deep enough to be genuinely dramatic - it's ""The Family Stone"", the latest in a long line of Hollywood's attempts to stick it to the nuclear family.  The story throws in a real twist - in this case, the family isn't nuclear at all, it's the apparently conventional Stones living in a picture-perfect New England setting, but having decidedly liberal leanings.  Instead, the uptight and archaic American reserve is embodied by Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker - playing well against type).  Meredith is on the verge of being engaged to Everett Stone (Mulroney).  Meredith has already met Amy Stone (Rachel McAdams) and unsurprisingly, Amy not only hates Meredith, but colors the family's opinion of her as well.  Soon, it's not Amy, but Stone matriarch Sybil (Diane Keaton) who becomes Meredith's staunchest foe.  A succession of ever-more painfully awkward scenes follow which only cement the unfavorable opinion the Stones have for Meredith (Meredith is an uptight, self-absorbed motor-mouth lacking in people skills; in the space of two days, she insults Everett's gay brother and twice insults his African-American partner).  Soon, the script tosses in two plot complications - Meredith calls for help from her less uptight sister, Julie (Claire Danes), while simultaneously developing a weird chemistry with Everett's brother Ben (Luke Wilson).  Will Meredith conquer or be conquered by the Stones?  How can she win Sybil over?None of these questions are ever really answered, because they're more forced than asked.  The script never really examines the motivations or feelings of its characters or much else about them.  We're supposed to believe that the Stones and Meredith are liberal/conservative counterpoints, but we're never supplied the evidence for either bent by either character.  Even the disaster at Christmas dinner - it's unclear if we're seeing the confrontation of different philosophies or simply a grand mal faux pas on Meredith's part.  Nothing really explains why Meredith is so quickly disliked by an otherwise tolerant family, and the story doesn't so much inform those motivations than simply maneuver its characters across a chessboard according to a power of will entirely external from the characters themselves.  Everett's brother and his lover never become characters or even develop beyond plot devices used to take Meredith apart and enoble the Stone parents.  None of the situations are all that funny, largely because they're much too clumsily handled.  Few of the scenes link up to each other - most of the film is based on scenes that start in the middle and end on an awkward note, which means that they aren't dramatically coherent either.

974702,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000EMGJ72,Samuel McKewon,"[12, 17]","Every so often, Thomas Bezucha`s ""The Family Stone""  injects itself with a dose of reality about the modern liberal family - that intellectual, caustic, ""progressive,"" argumentative, often matriarchal nuclear unit with imperfections not unlike the conservative ""family values"" crew. Selfishness. Materialism. Pettiness. Depression. Noise. Veiled cruelty toward the black sheep of the group, which, in this case, is the one most interested in pleasing his parents.But this movie is not really sincere about the realities of such a family - it's serious about it, all right, but not sincere. It is a Christmas family mosaic where everybody gathers round the twelve-seat dining table of a nine-bedroom house for a seven-course meal to assume their roles and pick on The Prodigal Son's new girlfriend. It is also a button-pushing, shameless picture that insists we like that shrill, pushy Diane Keaton persona more or less because her character is dying of cancer. Keaton plays one of those ""full of it"" moms - falsely hip, falsely sage,  constantly yelling and hugging and pitching fits and hogging the stage - so accustomed  is she to this domestic tyranny that when the girlfriend calls her on it, we get a scene I couldn`t quite believe.Back to that in a minute. ""The Family Stone"" assembles a large cast for its tale: Keaton is Sybil; Craig T. Nelson is husband Kelly; Dermot Mulroney is the parent-pleaser Everett, Luke Wilson is the laid-back  Ben; Ty Giordano is the gay, deaf Thad. And Rachel McAdams slums (just a little) as mommy's academic daughter Amy, who sincerely (yet inexplicably) dislikes Everett's  straight-laced fianc&eacute;e Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) as much she will eventually like Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes), who arrives midway through and enraptures Everett, who`s 16 years older.""She does this thing with her throat,"" Amy says of Meredith's phlegm-clearing tic. Meredith cannot  relax, and the Stones' idea of hospitality is to let their guest know how hospitable they could be - if only she would make herself at home. Sybil and Amy take their snarky turns on Meredith. Sybil stares wistfully out the window awaiting the mid-movie revelation that she's dying. Mulroney puts on his Mulroney Face - think Stallone in mild anguish - while Everett wrestles with it all. Kelly and Ben eat marijuana brownies at the high school football field. Ben looks at Meredith as if he'd like to see if she loosens up drunk. Three potato chips if you've guessed she loosens up drunk.It leads to and falls away from that moment at the dinner table when Ty's homosexuality is thrown around for some tired, liberal humor. Ty and his boyfriend (Brian White) intend to adopt children, and Meredith asks a sincere question of nature vs. nurture, which Sybil bombastically turns into a mini-skit on how she wished all her sons had been gay, a plenty-ignorant thing to say, deliberately said for effect, which Meredith misses. Thus Meredith's second question: ""Do you really mean that?""What Bezucha writes next is fascinating, if brutal and unfair. The entire family dives into Meredith - it climaxes with Sybil literally cursing the girl to hell - while Ty, a saint by now, mists at the notion that maybe he, a deaf, gay man, has had a life he may not have wished on his brothers. Meredith is a stiff and suit, sure, but that ""The Family Stone""  actually brings her back into the fold after such a humiliation speaks of its intention to preach and convert.Of what? Hard to say. That gays should adopt children? That blowhards are better than the sincere because they`re dying and judgmental in the right ways? That all can be forgiven with, fittingly, an old photograph of the mother in her ninth month of pregnancy? That we should worship at the altar of human imperfection? That the movie is really a veiled tribute to the mother Bezucha either had or wished for? If so, well, I did not have.

The deaf gay son and his black partner planning to adopt a baby seemed to have been included so that Meredith could stick her foot in her mouth and offend the family the maximum amount.  Also, the movie was inconsistent in several areas.  Sometimes the family signed in the presence of the deaf son and many times they didn't.  The movie introduced Meredith's annoying mannerisms that drove the family crazy and then didn't carry through with them (thankfully so in the case of the throat clearing tic).To top off all the other subplots cluttering up the movie, the mother has terminal cancer and has not told any of her children, except the one son who lives the farthest away and guesses something is wrong.  That seemed unnecessary and maudlin.This film would have benefitted greatly from a serious script edit to cut out the unnecessary and distracting plot clutter and focus on family love, romantic love, and opening your heart and family to new people.  With more focus and less clutter, this would have been much better movie.I was bored enough by the movie itself that I didn't bother watching any of the deleted scenes or other special features.",2,Plot derailed by too much unnecessary stuff,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,1720,"['movie', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'was', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'solid', 'central', 'premise', 'son', 'home', 'uptight', 'woman', 'who', 'instantly', 'disliked', 'quirky', 'laid-back', 'family', 'makers', 'cluttered', 'up', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'too', 'many', 'distractions', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'work', 'extra', 'stuff', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'miniseries', 'regular', 'series', 'much', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'married', 'pregnant', 'daughter', 'grandaughter', 'waiting', 'husband', 'arrive', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'movie', 'clutter', 'deaf', 'gay', 'son', 'black', 'partner', 'planning', 'adopt', 'baby', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'so', 'Meredith', 'could', 'stick', 'foot', 'mouth', 'offend', 'family', 'maximum', 'amount', 'Also', 'movie', 'was', 'inconsistent', 'several', 'areas', 'Sometimes', 'family', 'signed', 'presence', 'deaf', 'son', 'many', 'times', 'did', ""n't"", 'movie', 'introduced', 'Meredith', 'annoying', 'mannerisms', 'drove', 'family', 'crazy', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'carry', 'thankfully', 'so', 'case', 'throat', 'clearing', 'tic', '.To', 'top', 'off', 'other', 'subplots', 'cluttering', 'up', 'movie', 'mother', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'not', 'told', 'children', 'one', 'son', 'who', 'farthest', 'away', 'guesses', 'something', 'wrong', 'seemed', 'unnecessary', 'maudlin.This', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'benefitted', 'greatly', 'serious', 'script', 'edit', 'cut', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'distracting', 'plot', 'clutter', 'focus', 'family', 'love', 'romantic', 'love', 'opening', 'heart', 'family', 'new', 'people', 'more', 'focus', 'less', 'clutter', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie.I', 'was', 'bored', 'enough', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watching', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'other', 'special', 'features']",N/A

While it certainly does have some truly laugh-out-loud moments, the most pleasant surprise for me was how dramatic it became at times.  The story centers around Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney), the eldest son of the Stone Family who has moved to New York and become very successful.  He is bringing his uptight girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) home to meet his family for Christmas. The Stones are a tight-knit bunch, full of colorful characters.  The parents, Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) and Sybil (Diane Keaton) are ex-hippies who are obviously very loving toward their large and diverse brood, which also includes Ben (Luke Wilson), a pot-smoking slacker; Thad (Tyrone Giordano), who is deaf and gay, but who, along with his partner Patrick (Brian White), is warmly accepted by his whole family; Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser), the first one of the kids to marry and have a daughter; and Amy (the excellent Rachel McAdams), the bitter young twenty something who isn't afraid to speak her mind.  Once Everett and Meredith arrive, complications begin to ensue.  Sometimes the results are funny, while other moments are deeply touching.  Occasionally the result is very raw, with the characters forced to confront truly difficult situations.  The romance becomes just a little coy, but the overall ensemble of this movie really plays well, thanks to some very sensitive performances.  Thomas Bezucha has written and directed a unique picture, full of hope in the face of adversity.  In a sense, he could be thought of as the 21st century's Frank Capra, especially if his future films retain this joyous spirit.

It's the same tired (liberal) stereotypes: the homosexual couple, Thad and Patrick  (Ty Giordano & Brian White), deaf and African-American, respectively, are loveable, charming, warm and wonderful; the parents, Kelly and Sybil (Craig Nelson and Diane Keaton), are open-minded, accepting of everyone (well, sort of), anything goes sorts; the two most financially successful characters, Everett (Dermot Mulroney) and Meredith (Sarah-Jessica Parker), are uptight, conservative bores; the far-out brother, Ben (Luke Wilson), is the peacemaker, gets Meredith to let her hair down (literally and figuratively.)Sybil and Amy (Rachel McAdams), the younger sister, are vicious, petty and foul-mouthed.  There is redemption in the end for both of them but by that time it's too late for the viewer.  Their cruelty earlier in the film is not overcome by the later overtures to their victim, Meredith.  Admittedly, the happy ending does brighten things up a bit.By and large the family is dysfunctional and not particularly likeable.  They're upper middle-class, elitist, nasty snobs.  Thad (with Patrick) and Ben are the only truly pleasant, loving figures in the clan and they mollify mean-spiritedness of Sybil and Amy.  It's difficult to watch Meredith diced and shredded by these women; but for Thad, Patrick and Ben, I would have turned off the movie.As soon as Everett sees Julie and Ben sees Meredith, you know where the story's going.

974730,A2V2XRUGEYYCGG,B000EMGJ72,Thomas Glebe,"[12, 22]","My habit as of late has been to give a film at least 15 to 20 minutes before I either watch the entire thing, or just give up.  Having a continuing stream of already seen or unseen on-demand digital choices, I try to the best of my abilities to keep up with films of a general genre, which I might be interested in.  This eliminates a lot of genres actually, as I can't stand, in no particular order, horror/slasher films, ""masterpiece theater-ish, British soap-operish"" borefests, most heavily/quickly subtitled foreign movies (because of my failing eyesight), most westerns, and anything/everything remotely connected with Michael Bay.Genres I generally favor, again in no particular order, are original or ground-breaking works from any time period, comedies and especially romantic comedies, intelligent and well done sci-fi flicks, and compelling and enlightening dramas, either based upon true-life stories or fictional ones.  ""The Family Stone"" falls into my last category mentioned, that of fictional drama, and with the big name cast and at times fast-moving plot, this passed my 20 or so minute mark of being tolerable.  And so I watched it till the end.  An end which was most satisfying, simply because it WAS the end of a terrible flick which I will never watch again.I have always found it easier to write about films I have a favorable opinion of, whether classic, older movies, or newly discovered studio or independent, more recently produced gems.  It's a lot tougher however, to write about films I've seen which I hated enough to bother trying to warn others with, what I hope will be a helpful review.  This becomes especially difficult when it concerns a film, which engenders in people a sort of love/hate view.  To cut to the chase of this review, I really hated this movie, and generally, here's why...This is well cast with several big names and lesser knowns, most of which have been involved with much better works than this, which is one of the reasons I was drawn to watch it in the first place, and which I suspect, a lot of others were and are and will be.  However, while all seem to give it a good effort, nothing can overcome, for me at least, the unbelievable characters (all of whom resemble no real human beings I've ever encountered), and the draw-by-numbers, unbelievable at every turn script and writing.  It all starts out promising, the whole premise, the genre, the cast, and it is all done with very professional, technical quality and generally unobtrusive direction, but early on I was scratching my brain at why I should feel the least bit empathetic with the ""family"" and its various components.  Which is what the film and the film's creators apparently want viewers to take away from all of this.  In that respect, this is a miserable misfire.The ""tagline"" of this film upon its release was ""Feel The Love.""  How ironic because the ""FAMILY STONE"" the supposedly ""uptight, conservative"" Sarah Jessica Parker meets up with when her fianc&eacute; coaxes her to an Xmas visit to HIS folks's home, seemed to me nothing more than a bunch of unlikable, ""neo-liberal,"" reactionary, upper middle class, intolerant, politically correct to the point of nausea, snobbish morons.Politically, I consider myself far, far to the left, but this movie really distorts generally held ideas of the ""left"" and ""liberal"" leaning folks out there, and does a real disservice to both.  The ""working title"" for this production was called ""Hating Her.""  The ""her"" obviously being Ms. Parker's character, ""Meredith Morton.""  Yet, this whole premise is why the film fails.  Because Meredith's character is really not political at all, but just a lazy, convenient poor-scriptwriting miscreant, one of whose major SINS against ""the family"" seems to be her habit of clearing her throat when nervous!  Great reason to hate her!  Or her raising misguided but civil, honest issues at the holiday dinner table, where she is ridiculously crucified for it.  Up to and including the end, I felt so much more sympathy for her than the B-word mother (Keaton) who supposedly suffers and eventually dies (but by then, I almost cheered).  Bad writing, bad, bad, bad writing.First, there really is no establishing development of Meredith's character except for a few surface features, none of which are important or revealing.  Second, given this, there is no real establishing development of the ""family"" and its dynamics and conflicts, let alone any believable explanation of their rather mean-spirited and hateful ""eccentricities.""  Third, the filmmakers seem throughout till the very pretentious end, are asking the viewer to NOT identify with a likeable villain, Sarah, and IDENTIFY with a truly unlikable group, the family.  It all eventually makes no sense at all.Throughout, my main continuing thought was from the beginning, WHY exactly does most of the ""family"" here HATE ""HER?""  In fact, if anything, after the requisite 15-20 minutes, I found myself asking, why in the world would Sarah Jessica Parker's character want ANYTHING to do with this family of creeps?  Absurdly, various reasons are thrown about for the family character's ""hateful"" and contrived ""behaviors,"" but by the film's completely over-the-top, sappy, totally illogical and pandering finish, it was all too late.  The way all of this resolves, with double one-night stands replacing seemingly established character involvements all just adds to the mess this movie is, from beginning to end.A really, really, really bad movie.  Spend a couple of hours of your movie-viewing life on better than this junk.  It's hard really to fit this into any genre, though it tries to alternately switch between comedy, drama, and romance.  The only genre I will consign this to for future reference is that of really, really, really bad movies, which does its cast and production values a real shame.",1,Worst movie I've recently seen till

The engaged couple, Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Everett (Dermot Mulroney) are the oldest children of their respective families. They're the successful high achievers of the family, but they're also wound very tight and very anxious about how others are reacting to them. As a first child I know all about the pressure to be perfect all the time, yet then judged for being too perfect! As the saying goes, a halo only has to slip 9 inches to become a noose . . .I was pretty sure that the movie was going to be about how they learn to relax, be themselves, and let others in. But the movie's deeper than that. While Meredith gets attacked repeatedly for her uptightness, eventually she does something that is, in fact, perfect - she gives a gift to the family that is exactly what they need. The only person who doesn't realize it is Meredith.The cast is uniformly good. Luke Wilson mostly played Luke Wilson, but in one scene made me cry.

Meredith is invited to the home of her boyfriend Everett (Dermot Mulroney) for the Christmas holidays, but his family (the Stones ... subtle naming, isn't it?) consists of mostly unconventional and eccentric members. So what happens in their annual celebration?Now, don't get me wrong. I know the eccentricity in characters can be fun. However, to be eccentric for the Stones means, if I may borrow another reviewer's word, to be judgmental. Many of the Stones behave in a palpably cold and detached way towards Meredith (and some even before they meet her).Please tell me, what should I feel when Everett's mom is not nice to her, and she is played by usually charming and lovely Diane Keaton? And what should I do when not only Everett's gay brother is unkind to her, but his sister (Rachel McAdams) is so mean and cruel to Meredith, who is only trying to be polite? AND we are supposed to smile at whatever the Stones say and do, including two paper thin characters - Luke Wilson as hippie like brother and Craig T Nelson whose character as daddy is totally unmemorable? I think I am a pretty attentive person, but as far as I can remember, I have never discerned a single moment that rings true in the film.And Meredith, who is supposed to be working as 'a career woman,' behaves very atrociously before the Stones at dinner, unnecessarily referring to the family member's sexuality and ethnicity. This manipulative scene (which includes crying Diane Keaton throwing fork) might be intended to be funny or insightful, but it only shows that the director does not know we normally do not talk in such offensive manners to each other at least during the Christmastime if not on the internet.To me the only person who really looks like a human (I mean, real human) is Clare Danes who plays the more laid-back sister of Meredith. But even she is subject to some uninspired direction (like falling from a bus like Buster Keaton .. I mean it) plus one conventional plot device called `I got a new boy/girlfriend' at the film's neat and mawkish ending.OK, I know. Any familiar plot can be forgiven. Most comedies or romances are based on familiar settings, and the results are often pleasant. `The Family Stone' is NOT that pleasant, however, full of unbelievable behaviors from annoying people. The film ends with a neat and sappy conclusion, but that only worsens the incredibly bad writing of the whole film which also includes a person with terminal disease. Oh, please.

974739,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B000EMGJ72,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[2, 4]","Diane Keaton is the empitome of naturalism; not the sort of naturalism where an illusion of how people really do sound and seem is acheived so much as everything on top of such surface behavior, the sort of humanity we keep within our own homes; the mannerisms we're perhaps too ashamed to let free in public, those little idiosyncrasies that only family are so privalaged to see. In emanating this realism, every moment of her performance as Sybil Stone feels utterly convincing. She swears in front of her family, she inhibits none of her opinions, and she seems to embrace her son Ben's tendencies towards pot and nudity as endearing quirks rather than moral corruption. Keaton made me love her from the first devastating frames of Sybil looking at what may end up being her final Christmas tree, the little bits of family she cherishes in spite of what some may label as dysfunction, or what I would label as normalities.Keaton, however, may be the biggest redeeming factor of ""The Family Stone,"" a somewhat lovable but often weak holiday ensemble dramedy. Its tonal imbalance threatens to undermine what humanity there is. Since family comedies are more commonly delivered in the form of sophomoric romps like Meet the Fockers, this ""humanity"" is something to appreciate, no matter if it comes in broad patches without ever being stitched together. The realism may be responsible for the prior buzz calling Stone ""intelligent."" Sure, it's mildly intelligent and grasps family dynamics with considerable strength, yet there's too much slapstick and even too much cruelty to consider ""The Family Stone"" anything revelatory.None of the actors, though, have anything to do with holding the film back. They are its source of warmth; particularly Keaton and Luke Wilson, the latter of whom really proves himself to be a great presence in the film. The ensemble digs deep for the intelligence and brings it to the surface often making what could have been ridiculous (Wilson's ""I was the snow"" monologue, for instance) effective in reflecting the ways we often express ourselves in hopefully profound but entirely silly metaphors. What's even more commendable is the fact that one of the more unknown actors (Elizabeth Reaser as Susannah Stone) offers one of the film's most reliant points of solace. Her Susannah encompasses all the qualities of a young mother, offering the calm of understanding at all points.Surprisingly, the film's flaws arrive as soon as Sarah Jessica Parker hits the screen. I love her to death (""Sex and the City"" is one of my favorites) and I'll make the firm point that she does a fine job. The problems just cannot be attributed to her but instead to Thomas Bezucha's screenplay. As previously mentioned, it's hailed by the film's fans as thoroughly intelligent, but Parker is given a caricature to work with, a person who simply changes as any prototypical uptight fiance-meeting-the-family inevitably does: first the hair's up, then it's down with beautiful flow and relaxation. Parker does a great job making Meredith more plausible than the screenplay allows. Her greatest achievement is maintaining audience sympathy when she makes a point to Sybil about raising gay children in the absolute worst way.But therein lies the problem: Parker has to fight too hard against the irritating qualities inherent in her character as well as the cruelties of the Stone family, which is relentlessly judgmental. Perhaps the family's protectiveness over Everett, the son engaged to Meredith, would've been understandable had there not been so much slapstick (a paradoxical tone that is never well balanced). Bezucha's use of comedy is rather pedestrian and only cheapens the drama, regardless of whether or not the comedy is funny. Ultimately, The Family Stone could have been better with a stronger director capable of handling the contradictory tone (dramedies are possible, but most certainly difficult). At least Bezucha manages to capture some humanity and some warmth, and the performances are stellar. Its most positive aspect is contradicting the expectations of a ""dysfunctional"" family, a claim that bothered me going into the film. If this family is dysfunctional, what family is functional? Like Sybil, Bezucha embraces each character's characteristic flaws and demonstrates the unique bond of a family: you can't choose who they are, so you learn to love each other for your differences and eccentricities. The imperfection is what makes this bond stronger. Above all else, Bezucha understands this, and maybe that's most important.",3,recommended with reservations: here's why,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",2006,4563,"['Diane', 'Keaton', 'empitome', 'naturalism', 'not', 'sort', 'naturalism', 'where', 'illusion', 'how', 'people', 'really', 'do', 'sound', 'seem', 'acheived', 'so', 'much', 'everything', 'top', 'such', 'surface', 'behavior', 'sort', 'humanity', 'keep', 'own', 'homes', 'mannerisms', ""'re"", 'perhaps', 'too', 'ashamed', 'let', 'free', 'public', 'little', 'idiosyncrasies', 'only', 'family', 'are', 'so', 'privalaged', 'see', 'emanating', 'realism', 'moment', 'performance', 'Sybil', 'Stone', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'front', 'family', 'none', 'opinions', 'embrace', 'son', 'Ben', 'tendencies', 'towards', 'pot', 'nudity', 'endearing', 'quirks', 'rather', 'moral', 'corruption', 'Keaton', 'made', 'love', 'first', 'devastating', 'frames', 'Sybil', 'looking', 'what', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'final', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'little', 'bits', 'family', 'spite', 'what', 'may', 'label', 'dysfunction', 'what', 'would', 'label', 'normalities.Keaton', 'however', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'redeeming', 'factor', 'Family', 'Stone', 'somewhat', 'lovable', 'often', 'weak', 'holiday', 'ensemble', 'dramedy', 'tonal', 'imbalance', 'threatens', 'undermine', 'what', 'humanity', 'family', 'comedies', 'are', 'more', 'commonly', 'delivered', 'form', 'sophomoric', 'romps', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'humanity', 'something', 'appreciate', 'matter', 'broad', 'patches', 'ever', 'being', 'stitched', 'together', 'realism', 'may', 'be', 'responsible', 'prior', 'buzz', 'calling', 'Stone', 'intelligent', 'Sure', 'mildly', 'intelligent', 'grasps', 'family', 'dynamics', 'considerable', 'strength', 'too', 'much', 'slapstick', 'even', 'too', 'much', 'cruelty', 'consider', 'Family', 'Stone', 'anything', 'revelatory.None', 'actors', 'though', 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'holding', 'film', 'back', 'are', 'source', 'warmth', 'particularly', 'Keaton', 'Luke', 'Wilson', 'latter', 'whom', 'really', 'be', 'great', 'presence', 'film', 'ensemble', 'digs', 'deep', 'intelligence', 'surface', 'often', 'making', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'ridiculous', 'Wilson', 'was', 'snow', 'monologue', 'instance', 'effective', 'reflecting', 'ways', 'often', 'express', 'ourselves', 'hopefully', 'profound', 'entirely', 'silly', 'metaphors', 'What', 'even', 'more', 'commendable', 'fact', 'one', 'more', 'unknown', 'actors', 'Elizabeth', 'Reaser', 'Susannah', 'Stone', 'one', 'film', 'most', 'reliant', 'points', 'solace', 'Susannah', 'qualities', 'young', 'mother', 'offering', 'calm', 'understanding', 'points.Surprisingly', 'film', 'flaws', 'arrive', 'as', 'soon', 'Sarah', 'Jessica', 'Parker', 'screen', 'love', 'death', 'Sex', 'City', 'one', 'favorites', ""'ll"", 'make', 'firm', 'point', 'fine', 'job', 'problems', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'attributed', 'instead', 'Thomas', 'Bezucha', 'screenplay', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'hailed', 'film', 'fans', 'thoroughly', 'intelligent', 'Parker', 'given', 'caricature', 'work', 'person', 'who', 'simply', 'changes', 'prototypical', 'uptight', 'fiance-meeting-the-family', 'inevitably', 'first', 'hair', 'up', 'then', 'down', 'beautiful', 'flow', 'relaxation', 'Parker', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'Meredith', 'more', 'plausible', 'screenplay', 'greatest', 'achievement', 'maintaining', 'audience', 'sympathy', 'when', 'point', 'Sybil', 'raising', 'gay', 'children', 'absolute', 'worst', 'way.But', 'therein', 'problem', 'Parker', 'fight', 'too', 'hard', 'irritating', 'qualities', 'inherent', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'cruelties', 'Stone', 'family', 'relentlessly', 'judgmental', 'Perhaps', 'family', 'protectiveness', 'Everett', 'son', 'engaged', 'Meredith', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'understandable', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'slapstick', 'paradoxical', 'tone', 'never', 'well', 'balanced', 'Bezucha', 'use', 'comedy', 'rather', 'pedestrian', 'only', 'drama', 'regardless', 'not', 'comedy', 'funny', 'Ultimately', 'Family', 'Stone', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'stronger', 'director', 'capable', 'handling', 'contradictory', 'tone', 'dramedies', 'are', 'possible', 'most', 'certainly', 'difficult', 'least', 'Bezucha', 'capture', 'humanity', 'warmth', 'performances', 'are', 'stellar', 'most', 'positive', 'aspect', 'contradicting', 'expectations', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'claim', 'bothered', 'going', 'film', 'family', 'dysfunctional', 'what', 'family', 'functional', 'Sybil', 'Bezucha', 'character', 'characteristic', 'flaws', 'unique', 'bond', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'choose', 'who', 'are', 'learn', 'love', 'other', 'differences', 'eccentricities', 'imperfection', 'what', 'bond', 'stronger', 'else', 'Bezucha', 'maybe', 'most', 'important']",N/A
