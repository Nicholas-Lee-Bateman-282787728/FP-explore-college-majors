76219,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,0784011710,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[4, 10]","I've seen Sophie's Choice many times and it's probably Meryl Streep's best performance.  She speaks English with a Polish accent, Polish, and German portraying a Holocaust survivor, a fictional character, but based on fact.  The best aspect is the realism and emotional intensity of the flashbacks.  So real that when the daughter is taken away the 5-year-old actress thought she was really about to die.The weaker aspect is Stingo's story.  William Styron is the author who injects himself into the story, which is something of a flaw.  It's always about, ""what does Stingo think about things, what's happening in Stingo's world"", and hence ends up watering down Sophie's harrowing story.  We get some comic relief with him and a girl who ""could say f***, but she could not do it.""  Very well, but what does it have to do with the main story?  Nothing.  And the poetry recitations at key moments detract from the story by oversentimentalizing.Kevin Kline is good, but too over-the-top, and the explanation for his behavior, that he's schizophrenic, doesn't add up.  It's explained that he was diagnosed at 10, but could the problem have been an arbitrary diagnosis (which leads his life down the road of institutionalization) rather than an actual disease.  I didn't read the book, so I'm not sure how it's dealt with there, but it seems that the whole character is completely dismissed with that diagnosis.  So his obsession with escaped Nazis doesn't matter because it's simply that, an obsession.  I'm glad Simon Wiesenthal wasn't dismissed this way.But aside from these weaknesses I loved the film overall, and Streep was completely into the role of Sophie.  You tend to get overcritical with the sidetracks when you see it a few times.",4,"Streep's excellence saves this from being ""Stingo's Story""",1067126400,"10 26, 2003",2003,1741,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'many', 'times', 'probably', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'best', 'performance', 'English', 'Polish', 'accent', 'Polish', 'German', 'portraying', 'Holocaust', 'survivor', 'fictional', 'character', 'based', 'fact', 'best', 'aspect', 'realism', 'emotional', 'intensity', 'flashbacks', 'So', 'real', 'when', 'daughter', 'taken', 'away', '5-year-old', 'actress', 'thought', 'was', 'really', 'die.The', 'weaker', 'aspect', 'Stingo', 'story', 'William', 'Styron', 'author', 'who', 'story', 'something', 'flaw', 'always', 'about', 'what', 'Stingo', 'think', 'things', 'what', 'happening', 'Stingo', 'world', 'hence', 'up', 'watering', 'down', 'Sophie', 'harrowing', 'story', 'get', 'comic', 'relief', 'girl', 'who', 'could', 'say', 'f***', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'Very', 'well', 'what', 'have', 'do', 'main', 'story', 'Nothing', 'poetry', 'recitations', 'key', 'moments', 'detract', 'story', 'oversentimentalizing.Kevin', 'Kline', 'good', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'explanation', 'behavior', 'schizophrenic', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'explained', 'was', 'diagnosed', '10', 'could', 'problem', 'have', 'been', 'arbitrary', 'diagnosis', 'life', 'down', 'road', 'institutionalization', 'rather', 'actual', 'disease', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'dealt', 'whole', 'character', 'completely', 'dismissed', 'diagnosis', 'obsession', 'escaped', 'Nazis', ""n't"", 'matter', 'simply', 'obsession', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Simon', 'Wiesenthal', 'was', ""n't"", 'dismissed', 'way.But', 'aside', 'weaknesses', 'loved', 'film', 'overall', 'Streep', 'was', 'completely', 'role', 'Sophie', 'tend', 'get', 'overcritical', 'sidetracks', 'when', 'see', 'few', 'times']",N/A

Demizrahi,"[11, 12]","Sophie's ChoiceHaving read the title Sophie's Choice, by William Styron, on which this movie is based upon and which is my favorite book of all the ones I have read until the present moment, because of its fantastic and extraordinary prose and drama plot, I just have to say that the movie does astonishingly depict the abovementioned literary work.I am always very cautious about watching a movie based upon a literary work (particularly such a first-rate one) since it usually does not give merit to the primary source, however, this time, I was astoundingly well impressed.  Meryl Streep, as the fair, Arial featured polish woman Sophie Zawistowska, portrays excellently the drama of a woman that was and survived the Nazi's concentration camps, and for one reason or another, had the luck to come out alive and ends up living, in 1947, in New York inside her own understandable private hell. A nightmare she shares with Nathan, her lover- Kevin Kline- and their writer friend Stingo- Peter MacNicol-. Their lives are entirely full of lies and, as the drama goes on, these falsehoods begin to unravel until the ending, when Sophie conveys her most hideous choice.Steep's actuation or performance is outstanding, brilliant and beautiful, and it won her an Academy Award.I would utterly recommend seeing this movie after you have read the masterpiece on which is based upon.

76223,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0784011710,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","I think that `Sophie's Choice' is not a film you can enjoy the first go around.  No, I think it takes at least two viewings before you can behold all that the film really represents.  It's kind of like `Million Dollar Baby', another film that doesn't really make an impression until the second viewing.  The reason for this is that you aren't really sure what all the fuss is about until the final moments of the film.  Both films seem like average movie going experiences until the emotionally crippling finales that open your eyes to a whole new way of viewing the film.  The second time around you are able to appreciate so much more because you know exactly what kind of film you're watching.The film follows a young aspiring writer nicknamed Stingo who moves into a boarding house in Brooklyn where he shares occupancy with a young and beautiful Polish immigrant named Sophie.  Sophie herself is nice enough, but her boyfriend Nathan is another story, one moment kind and affectionate and the next moment thrown into a jealous and unjustified rage.The film feels as though it is nothing more than a film of friendship and restrained affection (especially between Stingo and Sophie) and moves along as if the film is more concerned with Nathan and his effect of those around him than anything else; but as the film progresses towards the halfway mark the focus shifts and we realize that Sophie has a past so dark and horrible one can't help but be engrossed in it.  In fact, the best scenes of the film appear in gritty black and white and are spoken in German as Sophie recounts her life before Brooklyn.The acting in this film has been lauded, especially with regards to Meryl Streep, and that Oscar was more than earned (she donned a perfect Polish accent and learned to speak German for the role) but Meryl was not the only one pulling her weight.  Kevin Kline, who made his big screen debut with this film, does a good job with depicting his characters emotional state.  He comes off a little over-the-top and obnoxious until his character is fully explained, and then everything starts to fall into place.  Peter MacNicol was unjustly snubbed of an Oscar nomination, for his portrayal of Stingo is brilliantly controlled, matching Streep step for step but never overshadowing her.  He allows her to bloom but never fades away from view, keeping his viewpoint foremost in our minds.  This is Sophie's story told through his eyes, and we never forget that.And then there is Meryl, and what a revelation she is here.  Many have lauded this as her finest performance (Premiere Magazine has this listed as the #3 greatest performance of all time) and even if I slightly prefer her `A Cry in the Dark' performance I cannot deny that this is truly outstanding in every sense of the word.  I was utterly absorbed in her from the get go, and her final scene, that final revelation when you realize what choice Sophie had to make (it is now what you expect) she breaks your heart into a million pieces.  Streep has always been and will always be one of my favorite actresses of all time, and years, decades, centuries from now she will be remembered along with the greats like Bette Davis, Katherine Hepburn and (cross your fingers) Kate Winslet (LOVE) as one of the greatest actresses to ever grace the big screen and invade our hearts.So, in closing I must say that `Sophie's Choice' lives up to the hype.  It may not seem like it at first, but that's only because the film deceives you into thinking it's something that it's not.  Believe me, once the weight and or gravity of the film hits you it will change everything and you will see the film in its entirety in a whole new light.",5,Seeing this movie would be the right choice...,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",2008,3688,"['think', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'not', 'film', 'can', 'enjoy', 'first', 'go', 'around', 'No', 'think', 'least', 'two', 'viewings', 'can', 'behold', 'film', 'really', 'kind', 'Million', 'Dollar', 'Baby', 'film', ""n't"", 'really', 'make', 'impression', 'second', 'viewing', 'reason', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'sure', 'what', 'fuss', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'films', 'seem', 'like', 'average', 'movie', 'going', 'experiences', 'emotionally', 'crippling', 'finales', 'open', 'eyes', 'whole', 'new', 'way', 'viewing', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'are', 'able', 'appreciate', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'know', 'exactly', 'what', 'kind', 'film', ""'re"", 'watching.The', 'film', 'young', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'nicknamed', 'Stingo', 'who', 'boarding', 'house', 'Brooklyn', 'where', 'shares', 'occupancy', 'young', 'beautiful', 'Polish', 'immigrant', 'named', 'Sophie', 'Sophie', 'nice', 'enough', 'boyfriend', 'Nathan', 'story', 'one', 'moment', 'kind', 'affectionate', 'next', 'moment', 'thrown', 'jealous', 'unjustified', 'rage.The', 'film', 'feels', 'nothing', 'more', 'film', 'friendship', 'restrained', 'affection', 'especially', 'Stingo', 'Sophie', 'along', 'film', 'more', 'concerned', 'Nathan', 'effect', 'anything', 'else', 'film', 'halfway', 'focus', 'shifts', 'realize', 'Sophie', 'past', 'dark', 'horrible', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'engrossed', 'fact', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'appear', 'gritty', 'black', 'white', 'are', 'spoken', 'German', 'Sophie', 'recounts', 'life', 'Brooklyn.The', 'acting', 'film', 'been', 'lauded', 'especially', 'regards', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Oscar', 'was', 'more', 'earned', 'donned', 'perfect', 'Polish', 'accent', 'learned', 'speak', 'German', 'role', 'Meryl', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'one', 'pulling', 'weight', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'who', 'made', 'big', 'screen', 'debut', 'film', 'good', 'job', 'depicting', 'characters', 'emotional', 'state', 'off', 'little', 'over-the-top', 'obnoxious', 'character', 'fully', 'explained', 'then', 'everything', 'fall', 'place', 'Peter', 'MacNicol', 'was', 'unjustly', 'snubbed', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'Stingo', 'brilliantly', 'controlled', 'matching', 'Streep', 'step', 'step', 'never', 'overshadowing', 'bloom', 'never', 'away', 'view', 'keeping', 'viewpoint', 'foremost', 'minds', 'Sophie', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'never', 'forget', 'that.And', 'then', 'Meryl', 'what', 'revelation', 'here', 'Many', 'have', 'lauded', 'finest', 'performance', 'Premiere', 'Magazine', 'listed', '3', 'greatest', 'performance', 'time', 'even', 'slightly', 'prefer', 'Cry', 'Dark', 'performance', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'truly', 'outstanding', 'sense', 'word', 'was', 'utterly', 'absorbed', 'get', 'go', 'final', 'scene', 'final', 'revelation', 'when', 'realize', 'what', 'choice', 'Sophie', 'had', 'make', 'now', 'what', 'expect', 'heart', 'million', 'pieces', 'Streep', 'always', 'been', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'time', 'years', 'decades', 'centuries', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'remembered', 'greats', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Katherine', 'Hepburn', 'cross', 'fingers', 'Kate', 'Winslet', 'LOVE', 'one', 'greatest', 'actresses', 'ever', 'grace', 'big', 'screen', 'invade', 'hearts.So', 'closing', 'must', 'say', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'hype', 'may', 'not', 'seem', 'first', 'only', 'film', 'thinking', 'something', 'not', 'Believe', 'once', 'weight', 'gravity', 'film', 'will', 'change', 'everything', 'will', 'see', 'film', 'entirety', 'whole', 'new', 'light']",N/A

At any rate, one thing that I remember from those drama classes:  acting in film is different than acting on stage.  On film, it is OK, even desirable, for an actor to be subtle.  On stage, since the actors are farther away from their audience, subtlety is not always desirable.And this is why I've always been hit and miss, at least on film, with regards to Kevin Kline.  Personally, I find him to overexaggerate a bit, even to the point of being occaisonally borderline slapstick.  I'll bet he'd be fantastic though on stage, but I can't be sure as I've never seen him in a play.But here, Meryl Streep IS subtle, and she's fantastic.  It's hard to say which performance in her career is her best; you'd probably be splitting hairs.  But if you were to say, ""Meryl Streep's greatest performance is in 'Sophie's Choice,'"" you sure wouldn't get an argument from me.  She speaks at least three languages here -- I believe English, German and Polish(?) -- and her accent, of course, is perfect with all three.  (I've known people from that part of Europe who speak English, and Ms. Streep nails a European speaking English.  I also took German in college, and while I'll admit my German is poor, her's is better than mine will ever be.)I do have a little trouble whenever I see Peter MacNicol though.  I wasn't a fan of his character in ""Ally McBeal"" -- heck, I wasn't a fan of almost any of the characters in that TV series -- and unfortunately, I believe that Mr. MacNicol will always be associated with that role.  It's too bad, since overall, he's not a bad actor, and he does a very nice job here.I believe that there are several themes in this film:  Shame.  Loyalties.  But maybe most important, facades, as at least the Streep and Kline characters are not what they seem to be.  Each has his or her own secrets, and perhaps it's better for others to never learn those secrets.A pretty big recommendation by me.

(Then I lent it to someone, and oh well, we all know the end of that story.) I just about reached a moment of person ecstacy (nice way to put it , eh?)when I heard Meryl Streep was chosen to play Sophie.(My other mental choice was Faye Dunaway - Meryl is better, no question.)And when I saw the movie, like the book they kept peeling away layer after layer of her story until in the end we 'know' her truth. I have it on DVD and watch at least once a year. It reaches me, it scares me, it touches my soft places and hardens my defensive ones. It makes me question how the character survives at all, instead of just having a psychotic break in the camp (which would have been certain death).It is perhaps the most horrible of horror movies where it ishorrific, and the most touching of character pieces where Sophieis &quot;made to bloom like a rose&quot; in her humour, her humanity, and her regained health. It makes me laugh at all of Sophie's gentle and telling abuses of the language as she translates in her head and then speaks in a rather tortured eegnleesh. And it is also a remarkable movie for the sensitivity and strength of the three lead performances (Kevin Kline's debut!). Alan Pakula adapted and directed in a masterful sweep : history of the very large, and the very small. If he had never made another movie, this would be enough (but of course he did make others).It is hard to convince people (especially mothers) that they willenjoy the book or the film, because they all aready think they know what &quot;Sophie's choice&quot; is....but the point is that Sophie makes choices on many levels throughout the film - all of which promise salvation of a sort, and deliver something quite different. It is a tragedy in all too human terms, because in all liklihood, it is NOT fiction.

Shortly thereafter, I read the William Styron novel on which it is based. In the past 25 years (hard to imagine it has been that long ago) I have watched the movie many times, and reread the novel 4 or 5 times as well. I won't recount the outlines of the story (see the many customer reviews for that), but simply wish to say that of all the movies I've watched, this is the one that is most enduring, and in such a haunting, complex way. I think the ultimate test of a great movie is time - and after 25 years, this film continues to move me, and to linger again long after the final credits have rolled. All the aspects of a great movie are here: acting (incomparable by Meryl Streep), story-telling (I think it's one of the best translations of a novel to the big screen), cinematography (the shots of Sophie's face as she recounts her grim past to Stingo are almost artwork), and musical score (haunting, and deeply sorrowful,yet somehow hopeful).Also, the story works on several levels, as a history of the Holocaust (as seen from one person's experience), as a study on the nature of evil (and the devastating effects of a survivor's guilt), and ultimately, as a love story.....rising paradoxically above all the grief. The final images of this powerful film are indelible, and life-affirming.The documentary that accompanies the movie on the DvD is also quite informative, and includes many interesting insights from the actors, the director, Styron himself, and two Holocaust survivors, who bear witness to the very real tragedies of the many real-life Sophies whom were ""among the butchered and martyred children of this earth.""Wilfred Owen, the great English poet who died in the trenches of WWI once wrote, in a preface to a volume of his poetry: ""My subject is not poetry, but war, and the pity of war....the poetry is in the pity.""""Sophie's Choice"" is a movie that will touch a similar poetry in the human heart.

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[14, 14]","The incomparable Meryl Streep unleashes a devastating Academy Award performance (her second, but her only one as Best Actress to date) in this powerful and shattering tale of a Polish immigrant who survives the horrors of Hitler's Holocaust and the choice she is forced to make to her Nazi captors: which of her two children to sacrifice to the death camps. Setting out in post-war Brooklyn, the film introduces Sophie and an aspiring writer (a very young Peter McNicol) who live together with Sophie's tempestuous lover (Kevin Kline, in an amazing dramatic turn). Through flashbacks, director Alan J. Pakula guides us on an intelligent and probing but grippingly painful look at the horrors that War War II was to the millions of Hitler's victims and the extremes that his prisoners undertook to survive. Paluka's blend of Sophie's life in nostalgic Brooklyn and in the concentration camps of World War II is horrific in its effectiveness as it accentuates the absolute terror and inhumanity of the Holocaust. But that dramatic strategy might not have worked with any actress other than Streep. She is simply that devastating and wholly believeable with her perfect Polish accent and her decimated physical appearance because of her time in the custody of her Nazi victimizers. With that one performance, Streep managed to raise the level of leading actresses and likely earned her the distinction of being one of the industry's most respected performers ever. Her raw and honest emotional trauma makes ""Sophie's Choice"" a well-worthy watching, and the film's subject matters reminds us once again of the evil that man can do.",5,A shattering tale of sacrifice and survival,1045094400,"02 13, 2003",2003,1627,"['incomparable', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'devastating', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'second', 'only', 'one', 'Best', 'Actress', 'date', 'powerful', 'shattering', 'tale', 'Polish', 'immigrant', 'who', 'horrors', 'Hitler', 'Holocaust', 'choice', 'forced', 'make', 'Nazi', 'captors', 'two', 'children', 'sacrifice', 'death', 'camps', 'Setting', 'out', 'post-war', 'Brooklyn', 'film', 'introduces', 'Sophie', 'aspiring', 'writer', 'very', 'young', 'Peter', 'McNicol', 'who', 'live', 'together', 'Sophie', 'tempestuous', 'lover', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'amazing', 'dramatic', 'turn', 'flashbacks', 'director', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'intelligent', 'probing', 'grippingly', 'painful', 'look', 'horrors', 'War', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'millions', 'Hitler', 'victims', 'extremes', 'prisoners', 'undertook', 'survive', 'Paluka', 'blend', 'Sophie', 'life', 'nostalgic', 'Brooklyn', 'concentration', 'camps', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'horrific', 'effectiveness', 'absolute', 'terror', 'inhumanity', 'Holocaust', 'dramatic', 'strategy', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'worked', 'actress', 'other', 'Streep', 'simply', 'devastating', 'wholly', 'believeable', 'perfect', 'Polish', 'accent', 'decimated', 'physical', 'appearance', 'time', 'custody', 'Nazi', 'victimizers', 'one', 'performance', 'Streep', 'managed', 'raise', 'level', 'leading', 'actresses', 'likely', 'earned', 'distinction', 'being', 'one', 'industry', 'most', 'respected', 'performers', 'ever', 'raw', 'honest', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'well-worthy', 'watching', 'film', 'subject', 'matters', 'once', 'again', 'evil', 'man', 'can', 'do']",N/A

This movie is very lengthy - 2 hours and 30 minutes, and let me tell you, I could feel each and every minute sloooowly tick by. The story moves slowly as well, and it's hard to tell - what is real? What is false? Even when Sophie's &quot;choice&quot; is revealed at the end, are we, the audience, sure this is real or just a fabrication? As Sophie says somewhere in the movie, she has told so many lies it is hard to sort the truth from the falsehoods.The movie paints a portait of Stingo (Peter MacNicol, lately of Ally McBeal), a Southern writer who makes the acquaintance of Sophie and Nathan, his upstairs neighbors, and then can't get rid of them. Sophie's a Polish immigrant who has spent time in the concentration camps during WWII, while Nathan is a medical researcher obsessed with the evils of the Holocaust. Why did Sophie survive while so many others died? This is the question that haunts Nathan, and haunts Sophie, whose entire family was murdered in the concentration camps.Eventually, slowly, the story of Sophie emerges to Stingo, as we get some dramatic close-ups of Sophie telling us the story, making it feel more like a play than a movie. We flashback to life in the concentration camps, which has been prepared for us by the sadness which permeated the first half. Truths also begin to emerge about Nathan - and the tragic lives of Sophie and Nathan wind closer towards their end.Meryl Streep? Is just amazing. This is an awe-inspiring piece of work for Streep. She masters different dialects and speaks different languages for much of the film. Her Sophie is simply a haunting image that will stay with you long after the end credits finish. Kevin Kline as Nathan is perfect as well. Peter MacNicol? Well, I can take him or leave him.When the movie ends, you may have to wipe yourself off from the floor - not only from the tragic sadness and despair of the film, but from the mind-numbing length.

Imagine acting it with a baby growing inside of you.That is the scene that is shown so often in classrooms, talk shows and is, without doubt, the scene that replaces Orpon Wells lips whisper ""Rosebud."" Still, Streeps performance (that won her an Oscar just two years after wining an Oscar for ""Kramer vs Kramer"")is honest, liquid, cryptic and brilliant from the moment we first see her, sobbing on the steps at the Pink Palace, to the last moment we see her-the image forever capttured on the cover of the DVD Box and the paerback novel;Kevin Kline's lips gently on her cheek.Streep fought for this role, as it was a certainty to the producers that only an Eastern European unknown could make this happen. Not many of Styron's novels have made it to film because of the complexity of his characters and all of the internal struggle and conflict. How can an actor reproduce the emotions of one who is completely drowning in memory?No one knows, because Streep- the ultimate soccer Mom- is very modest about it. She tends to let her work speak for itself; she doesn't have one or three different techniques that she clings to, despite her Masdters Degree from the Yale School of Drama (Where she poerformed in the premier production of Sondheim's ""The Frogs"".) She speaks only of honesty.This DVD costs a little more than it would to rent it. As a result, every home in America should own a copy. Every acting student should study the performances; every directing and editing student whould look at the ways in which camera angles manipulate the strange to make it beautiful and how the horror is captured with taste rather than with violence. Like Demme did with ""Silence Of The Lambs"" our own imagination makes this film far more powerful than Carpenter does by showing us every detail in ""Halloween""' Or speilberg with ""Childler's List.""Streep's command of languages (She speaks three or four fluently in this film, the sloppiest being English)and dialect is rare. Many many actors have played roles in which they had to utilize a dialect, but the acting always suffers. Not in the case of Meryl Streep.In fact, when she won the Oscar and gave her brief thank you, her cheeks flushed pink with humility, her belly bulging in her 36th week of pregnancy, I was shocked to hear a Connecticut non-accent come out of her mouth.So you see, the film is one thing, but you must see this because Meryl streep has given us the most remarkable performance ever before. Her name is now synonomous with the best. She surpassed Katherine Hepburn and holds the record for the most Oscar nominagtions in history. (18)(""I always lose,"" she says. And she does, despite the spectacular graveside scene in ""Out Of Africa"" or her feet hanging over the end of the bed as Julia Child- not copying the real Child, no, but rter-creating a believable and loveable one who was far more empotahtetic than the actual woman.)You must see Sophie's Cpoice.See it for Streep.See it for youurself.

76245,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,0784011710,Deborah Earle,"[2, 3]","The late Alan J. Pakula, who both directed and wrote the screenplay for this most heart-rending of odysseys, did a formidable job of capturing life among the tenants in a pink-walled boardinghouse in 1947 Brooklyn.--Something author William Styron partially dreamt and partially lived.At an outside glance, that topic may seem unremarkable. But through Joseph Sommer's staid, wistful narration, we are drawn into this world in which a struggling young writer from Virginia, who answers to the name of ""Stingo""(Peter MacNicol) resides in this ""Kingdom of the Jews"", working as an editor for the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company by day, as he seeks literary inspiration of his own.Rita Karin as Yetta Zimmerman, is the 22-year-old-writer's landlady.Other tenants include Josh Mostel's Morris Fink,Marcell Rosenblatt's Astrid Weinstein, Moishe Rosenfeld's Moishe Rosenbaum, and Robin Bartlett Lillian Grossman.But the occupants who will change his life forever are the mercurial chemist, Nathan Landau (played to perfection by Kevin Kline, whose beautiful classical piano playing is inspiring), and his beautiful and mysterious lover, Sophie Zawistoski(the incomparable Meryl Streep with a dead-on Polish accent and a complexion which, like her character, has the fragility of Dresden porcelain).Stingo is intrigued by the volatility of the couple's relationship, and their eccentric habit of dressing in period costumes as they dance to the music of the era for which they have dressed.Gradually, the three become friends, and Sophie, a Polish Roman Catholic survivor of Auschwitz, reveals her past. In the meantime, Nathan arranges for something to be done about the young writer's sexual frustration by arranging for him to meet a formerly frigid psychiatric patient named Leslie Lapidus( Greta Turken).To the beauteous strains of Harry James' ""Sleepy Lagoon"", Stingo tries to court the nubile young creature, whose prior inhibitions  would not even allow her to say the ""F"" word, which she now uses repeatedly, only to have that not work out as he had hoped.We learn that after Sophie came to America, still in poor health after her ordeal,she attends classes at a University.After dealing with a campus librarian(John Rothman) who alternates between coldness and irritation when she gives an incorrect name for author Emily Dickinson when trying to get him to locate her works in the library, she collapses, and is encountered by Nathan. Not being in any position to refuse his help, she is taken in by Nathan, who helps treat her anemia, and feeds her.As Sophie's past unfolds, Stingo is also encountered by Nathan's brother, Larry (Stephen D. Newman), who reveals that while Nathan was a brilliant and promising young student in his formative years, but is now insane. Larry advises Stingo to monitor  his brother and report to him by phone periodically.Perhaps, however, it may have been unwise for  Larry to have advised Stingo to not offically reveal to Sophie the full truth about the insanity with she she has often dealt and which on more than one occasion has been injurious to her....Gradually, the haunted immigrant in her 30s discloses that her father(Ivica Pajer) was a Professor for whom she did secretarial work, and she typed the anti-Semitic speech he was to make with almost complete passivity, but then with far too many errors.When he recited the speech as written, the professor, who believed in the possibility of human perfection, verbally renounced his daughter, and Sophie's husband, who was his assistant, rejected her as well. Both men died during the occupation, when the Nazis rounded up and shot Polish intellectuals.Sophie's lover, Josef (Nadim Prohic), and his half-sister, Wanda( Katharina Thalbach) were brave resistance fighters, who would also fall to the Nazi Regime.Sophie is arrested with her two sweet, beautiful children Jan and Eva(Adrian Kalitka and Jennifer Lawn)and sent to Auschwitz by train.While she will later be pulled from the general prison population to work as a secretary for Commandant Rudolf Hoess(Gunter Maria Halmer) due to her ability to speak cultured German, the story of her initial encounter with him on the night of her arrival constitutes the devastating, dramatic climax of the whole saga.Auschwitz is a surreal world where Hoess' children (Irena Hampel, Sandra Markota, Hrvolje Sostaric, and Marko Zec) frolic happily in a cobblestone-padded garden park, while on the other size of the tall fence, inmates are crowded into long stalls with barred windows, pleading for water and mercy as they wait to be gassed.We observe this startling contrast as a female SS guard(Vida Jerman) escorts Sophie across the muddy prison yard, and past the corpse of a hanged inmate, through the gate door.Ulli Fessl plays Frau Hoess, Eugeniusz Priwieziencew plays a prisoner at the shower in Sophie's cell who tries to get her to steal the radio of Hoess' oldest daughter, Emmi(Melanie Pianka)so inmates can monitor the Allied fighters' progress. Ironically, it is Emmi who actually gives Sophie a moment of kindness and a sense of her past normalcy.Sophie returns to the general prison population, lamenting her failures in both her attempt to secure freedom for one of her children, and her attempt to steal Emmi's radio. She will spend a total of 20 months in the camp before liberation.The rest of the tale confirms the impossible love Stingo has for a haunted and doomed woman, unable to rise above a tragic past.The final words of an older and wiser Stingo are halting and poetic as we see the younger man crossing the Brooklyn Bridge, where he, Sophie, and Nathan had raised a toast and smashed glasses one night, with suitcase in hand on his way back home with a pained expression on his face; the netting of the bridge itself is like a hauntingly symmetrical poem as Marvin Hamlisch's musical score dolefully weeps for the butchered, betrayed, and martyred children of the earth, and we receive one last, and extremely faint glimpse of a glistening-eyed beauty who leaves an indelible mark on the heart of the man who will write her story.",5,Styron's Half-Dream Brought to Full Onscreen Fruition!,1318377600,"10 12, 2011",2011,6098,"['late', 'Alan', 'J.', 'Pakula', 'who', 'directed', 'wrote', 'screenplay',

(AndMamma Miadoesn't count.)You're right.  There isn't one.And perhaps Streep's very best role is in the haunting, troubling SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  I've seen this film on several occasions, and it's blown my socks off every time.  Set in post-World War II Brooklyn, this is a story containing nuance, tenderness, guilt, remorse, discovery. . .raw emotion.  And the focal point is Meryl Streep's role as Sophie, a Polish immigrant trying to overcome a most horrific past.Told from the point of view of young Southern writer Stingo (a very fragile-looking Peter MacNicol), we witness the developing relationships of the three main characters:  Stingo, Sophie, and her lover, Nathan (Kevin Kline, who brings this bipolar biologist to vivid life).  Stingo, in effect, becomes a third wheel to the couple, and realizes there is more, much more, to Sophie and Nathan than meets the eye.  And as we move deeper into the story, we the viewers become privy to more and more of the troubling details of Sophie's European past, until the details become not troubling, but horrific, when Sophie must make a most heart-wrenching choice concerning her two children.While Kline and MacNicol are exceptional, Streep is absolutely flawless as the beautiful, yet mortally wounded, Sophie.  Streep is indeed the motor that drives the intensity of this story--a story that will break your heart as it ends.  Streep is not a good actress, she's a great actress; to say SOPHIE'S CHOICE is her very best role gets no argument from me.--D.

As a survivor of the holocaust, Sophie (portrayed by Streep) is haunted by a continual sense of failure and betrayal.  This is altogether unfair, given that she had no control over her situation in the concentration camp, but it is poignant nonetheless.One of the most disturbing parts of the movie is where it shows the children of Nazi officers running around, laughing & playing and doing what children do.  That in itself is not surprising, but it's the fact that they do these things right in the shadow of the death camp that creates a a shocking juxtaposition.Most people who have heard of this film are well aware of what Sophie's &#34;choice&#34; entails.

Shkodra,"[5, 8]","This movie should be shown to every student in acting, not much as an example of filmmaking, as the film itself is flawed and slowpaced, although truly beautiful in patches, but as an example of acting. Mac Nicol and especially Kline offer very good performances, but the real standout in this movie is of course Meryl Streep, the greatest of them all.Yes, Katharine Hepburn was charming, yes, Bette Davis' eyes were the silver screen's most expressive ones, yes, one single silent moment in a Greta Garbo movie was well worth the price of the ticket or that of the DVD, yes, Liz Taylor was beautiful and skillful, yes, Jane Fonda was talented and versatile. But when it comes to sheer acting skills Meryl is simply the best. I mean the best of all time. So far she has offered us so many totally different characters speaking different languages and accents that I wouldn't be too surprised seeing her onscreen speaking perfect chinese or albanian in a near future. Personally I don't consider her so much an actress as an incarnation of the character she plays, and she has already pushed this concept to further limits. She is so studied and spontaneous at the same time, poignant, moving, cold, distant, expressive, fascinating, sexy, sometimes even beautiful, economical and parsimonious in her acting. Like de Niro, she simply has no limits at all.I don't like so much comparing one actor to another, especially actors or actresses that have lived and worked in different decades or centuries, and not only actors; I mean, how can you compare Shakespeare to Hugo, Einstein to Newton, Macchiavelli to Churchill, Mohammed Ali to Michael Jordan, Beethoven to Mozart, Brando to de Niro?But sometimes it happens that the gap between the best and the rest of them all is so obvious that you can't help comparing and choosing. I just hope that Meryl Streep continues to make more and more beautiful movies and offer us more pleasure and emotions with her acting skills, although quite frankly I don't expect her to top herself, as what she's done in ""Sophie's choice"" is as good as acting in movies can get.

This film, for all the things it has going for it-- and there are many-- does not make my list of ten best movies. First the good: Meryl Streep deserved the Oscar she won for the role of Sophie, the Polish survivor of a Nazi concentration camp. (On the other hand, I think she deserves an Oscar for practically everything she has ever done.) She is totally believable here, never gets out of character, and in spite of the catty critics who always talk about her many accents, her accent here is perfect. Her scenes in the concentration camp are almost too painful to watch. Kevin Kline is great as the tortured, crazed Nathan. (Although this was his first starring role, he has gone on to other fine performances.)The cinamatography is by the brilliant Nestor Amendros, who as best I can tell never shot a bad movie.  Now the less than good: Stingo is miscast although I cannot put my finger on just what is wrong about the way he is portrayed in the movie. I just know his character doesn't always work for me. My chief criticism, which I know is unfair, is that the movie is not the book and pales when compared to Styron's novel.

And the truth does not make it easier to understand.""So says Sophie Zawistowski, the tormented woman at the center of ""Sophie's Choice."" Alan J. Pakula's film of William Styron's novel stands proudly alongside ""Schindler's List"" as a document of the Holocaust, but while the latter film tells the story of a people, this movie chooses to tell one woman's unspeakable story. Everything about ""Sophie's Choice"" is right. Pakula's direction and screenplay are superb, and the cinematography by Nestor Almendros is breathtakingly beautiful. The centerpiece of the film, however, is Meryl Streep's Oscar-winning performance as Sophie (probably the most deserved win in history) and the equally brilliant turns by Kevin Kline (in his first film role) and a very young Peter MacNicol.A young writer named Stingo (MacNicol) comes to Brooklyn ""on a voyage of discovery,"" and while living there meets Sophie and Nathan (Streep and Kline), two lovers who quickly befriend him. Stingo soon developes a crush on Sophie, and learns that she is a survivor of Auschwitz. While the seductive Nathan becomes ever more dangerous, Stingo gradually learns the secrets of Sophie's past, a past filled with terrible secrets and unbearable pain and guilt.Meryl Streep gives possibly the best film performance ever as Sophie, completely becoming the Polish Holocaust survivor. The range and complexity of her performance is astonishing. Streep has many monologues as Sophie where she reveals more an more of the horrors she witnessed in the concentration camps, and these are all filmed in close up on Streep's face. It's riveting. As played by Streep, Sophie is a woman filled with immense hope, but also haunted by suffering, her eyes almost always close to tears. The final scene of ""the choice"" is almost unbearable in its intensity and will disturb you for days. A monumental performance that never seems like acting.As an actor, Kevin Kline tends to go over the top, but he does some of his best work ever in ""Sophie's Choice"" as the demented Nathan. His mood swings from lovable to terrifying are completely believable, and quite scary. Peter MacNicol also makes the most of Stingo, probably the least interesting character. As the film's narrator, his subtle and honest work holds the movie together. Without him, it wouldn't work.At 150 minutes, ""Sophie's Choice"" is a little overlong. Alan J. Pakula was so concerned about being faith to the book that there are several scenes that probably should have been left on the cutting room floor. However, the movie is a remarkable achievement, one that will make you cry and leave you completely absorbed the entire time. ""Sophie's Choice"" plays like a mystery. You can't look away until you find out the terrible secret of her past.

76276,A2VMVTDYQDA6L8,0784011710,Laura Knight-Jadczyk,"[9, 10]","I read Styron's novel, Sophie's Choice, when it first came out.  I was mesmerized all the way through.  I didn't go to see the movie in the theatre because, knowing the story, I didn't want to be depressed.  A couple of years ago, I bought the movie, but it sat on the shelf for a long time, unwatched until last night when I viewed it with my family, none of whom had read the book.My Polish husband left the room about half way through because he just couldn't stand to be reminded of things that were way too real for him.  The rest of us continued to watch, hypnotized by the inexorable unfolding of the tragedy.  After it was over, nobody spoke for a very long time. It's that kind of movie.There is something about the movie, though, that disturbs me.  You see, the book had a certain emphasis that was excluded from the movie version.  In Styron's novel, he is explicit about the parallels between the Nazi/Jew atrocities and the terrible abuses of the American South against Black Americans.  This was an important theme - the universality of suffering - that he then developed more fully by making Sophie, a NON-Jew, the center of the story.  In the novel, the suffering of the Jews IS discussed, but it is made quite clear that Hitler's main target was the Slavs.  He carefully makes his case that the Holocaust is NOT an exclusively Jewish experience or tragedy. The fact is, 6 million Polish citizens were killed by the Nazis, only half of which were Jews.  The other three million victims were Polish Christians and Catholics. For the Nazis, the Poles were, in fact, the First Target:  ""All Poles will disappear from the world.... It is essential that the great German people should consider it as its major task to destroy all Poles.""  (Heinrich Himmler)Hitler quickly took control of Poland by specifically targeting and eliminating the Polish Intelligentsia. During the next few years, millions of other Polish citizens were rounded up made slaves for German farmers and factories or taken to concentration camps where they were either starved and worked to death or used for scientific experiments.The Jews in Poland were forced inside ghettos, but the non-Jews were made prisoners in the concentration camps very early, as well as inside their own country. No one was allowed out.That's what Sophie's Choice was about, mainly: the suffering of the Poles, and Sophie exemplified this suffering.  But this major theme has been completely lost in the movie version.Nathan, the ""spokesman for the Jews"" in the story, is a paranoid schizophrenic which might be considered a subtle way to portray the ""paranoid"" nature of the Jewish claim for Holocaust exclusivity.  Entwined with the major theme of the book is Nathan's inability to cope with the fact that Sophie, a Polish-Catholic, experienced horrifying  sufferings that were claimed to be exclusively Jewish.The monstrous decision that Sophie is forced to make (sometimes idiomatically used as way of describing a choice between two unbearable options, a  ""Sophie's Choice""), is not even fully portrayed in the film version.  In the novel, Sophie describes the fussing and whining and crying of her daughter who was sick with an untreated ear infection prior to being forced to make the choice.  It is suggested that her choice was partly influenced by her irritation at the child which makes it all the more monstrous.Meryl Streep gives a fabulous performance as do Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol.  All three are perfect for their roles.  The movie is only slightly slow, but still manages to carry the viewer along.  It could have been a better movie if the nuances of Sophie's choice as well as the primary themes of the book had been included.  These elements would have made it stupendous instead of just excellent.All through the book and movie, Sophie faces choices and in every instance, she chooses from a position of illusion of safety and fear, and it seems to be suggested that when she chooses, someone dies as a consequence of her choice.For example, after her father and her husband have been taken by the Nazis (at that point, you would think that Sophie would have realized that there was no rationality to Nazism since her father and husband were supporters of the Nazis and died anyway), she has a lover, J&oacute;zef, who, with his half-sister, Wanda, is a member of the Polish Resistance. They ask Sophie to translate some stolen Gestapo documents, but fearing she might get into trouble, she refuses. Two weeks later, J&oacute;zef is murdered by the Gestapo.  One gets the impression that if Sophie had helped, this might not have happened, but that is uncertain.  It is only a short time later that Sophie is arrested and sent to Auschwitz with her children.  So, again, holding back, acting out of fear for the self, trying to protect the self, is not seen to be a good choice.When Sophie is in line at Auschwitz, she again tries to save herself and her children by telling a doctor that she is a good catholic, a supporter of the Reich, etc.  Even though she is pretending to support the Nazis out of fear for herself and her children, and trying to save them, it is this act that precipitates the terrible choice.  There is clearly no humanity in the Nazi mentality and that is something that Sophie never seems to grasp.  She continues to think that they are normal humans, that they can be reasoned with, their consciences appealed to, when it is clear they are psychopaths and have no consciences at all.  This occurs again in her interactions with camp commandant Hess.  She refuses to help others by stealing a radio, and caves in to her fears again and pretends to be a Nazi supporter to try to save herself and her son.Again and again Sophie makes the wrong choices.  Finally, Sophie seems to understand that saving herself isn't worth what she has paid with the coin of her soul.  She returns to the deadly embrace of her Jewish lover who, in his paranoid schizophrenia, takes both their lives.Perhaps a prophetic lesson for our own times. It's a beautiful film, but it could have been better with very little effort.",4,"Beautiful Film, but...",1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,6118,"['read', 'Styron', 'novel', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'when',

Sophie's Choice earned the #91 spot for the amazing acting of Meryl Streep, along with Kevin Kline's breakout performance with his first ever film role.Meryl is stunning as a Polish woman who barely survived the German horrors of World War II. She saw nearly her entire family taken away and slain. It was only Kevin's intervention that kept her from dying in the US from the many illneseses she took on during the war years. So she is dearly devoted to him, even through his manic highs and violent lows.Peter comes along as a barely-of-age writer from the South who wants to write the next American novel in the streets of Brooklyn. The three form a friendship, and over time Peter is able to learn more and more about what Meryl went through.Have I mentioned Meryl is an incredible actress? She has so many emotions to portray over the course of the story - love, desperation, terror, hope, resolution. In each turn she appears perfectly in tune with her character. Her accent is pure music on the ears. She's shown in other movies that it's not just this Polish accent that she excels at, but she can do a wide range of characters.It's stunning that there's even scenes of females talking with other females, which you pretty much NEVER get in any movie. Usually it's all about men with perhaps a woman or two sprinkled in for entertainment. Here one of the most powerful scenes is when Meryl is sitting talking with a young German girl, and moving past initial class differences to touch on a more human connection.Certainly a movie that one could watch, and rewatch, and always find something new in the performances and meanings. From the twists in Kevin's moods to the subtle changes in Meryl's emotions, this movie is acting at its finest.Well recommended.",5,Great for Watching and Rewatching,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,1914,"['Somehow', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'first', 'release', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'listing', 'remedied', 'when', 'revoted', 'ten', 'years', 'later', 'Sophie', 'Choice', 'earned', '91', 'spot', 'amazing', 'acting', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'breakout', 'performance', 'first', 'ever', 'film', 'role.Meryl', 'stunning', 'Polish', 'woman', 'who', 'barely', 'survived', 'German', 'horrors', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'saw', 'nearly', 'entire', 'family', 'taken', 'away', 'slain', 'was', 'only', 'Kevin', 'intervention', 'kept', 'dying', 'US', 'many', 'illneseses', 'took', 'war', 'years', 'dearly', 'devoted', 'even', 'manic', 'highs', 'violent', 'lows.Peter', 'along', 'barely-of-age', 'writer', 'South', 'who', 'write', 'next', 'American', 'novel', 'streets', 'Brooklyn', 'three', 'form', 'friendship', 'time', 'Peter', 'able', 'learn', 'more', 'more', 'what', 'Meryl', 'went', 'through.Have', 'mentioned', 'Meryl', 'incredible', 'actress', 'so', 'many', 'emotions', 'portray', 'course', 'story', 'love', 'desperation', 'terror', 'hope', 'resolution', 'turn', 'perfectly', 'tune', 'character', 'accent', 'pure', 'music', 'ears', 'shown', 'other', 'movies', 'not', 'just', 'Polish', 'accent', 'can', 'do', 'wide', 'range', 'characters.It', 'stunning', 'even', 'scenes', 'females', 'talking', 'other', 'females', 'pretty', 'much', 'NEVER', 'get', 'movie', 'men', 'perhaps', 'woman', 'two', 'sprinkled', 'entertainment', 'Here', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'when', 'Meryl', 'sitting', 'talking', 'young', 'German', 'girl', 'moving', 'past', 'initial', 'class', 'differences', 'touch', 'more', 'human', 'connection.Certainly', 'movie', 'one', 'could', 'watch', 'rewatch', 'always', 'find', 'something', 'new', 'performances', 'meanings', 'twists', 'Kevin', 'moods', 'subtle', 'changes', 'Meryl', 'emotions', 'movie', 'acting', 'finest.Well', 'recommended']",N/A

76284,A2R6RA8FRBS608,0784011710,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","Sophie's Choice is by far one of the very best films I've ever seen. This period piece was done with the greatest of care--we get excellent, convincing acting; a fine script; outstanding choreography and cinematography; character development and more. The plot moves along at a good pace and although the movie runs two and one-half hours I was never once bored--these characters drew me in; the story grabbed me by the throat and never let me go until the very final frame of the picture. In addition, the recurring theme of life as opposed to death runs through the picture to make this film most powerful indeed.When the action starts in 1947, we meet young 22 year-old Stingo (Peter MacNicol) who has moved to Brooklyn, New York from the South to become a full fledged writer; he has high hopes for his future. Naturally, he finds Brooklyn to be rather different than the Deep South but he quickly makes friends with Sophie (Meryl Streep), a beautiful Polish &eacute;migr&eacute; and her rather unstable lover, Nathan (Kevin Kline); they share an apartment in the same boarding house that Stingo moves into. Stingo becomes fast friends with Sophie and Nathan although he is bothered by Nathan's incredible outbursts of anger and violence that sometimes result in Sophie being physically harmed.It is through Stingo's eyes that we get to know Nathan as well as Sophie's disturbing and complicated past. Sophie tells Stingo that her father and husband were killed by the Nazis at the onset of World War Two; and Sophie makes it clear that she agreed with her father when it came to his hatred of the Nazis about which he lectured at the University in Poland where he taught. However, halfway through the film Stingo learns that Sophie has not exactly been telling him the truth and that Nathan is also hiding the truth--and the disappointed Stingo almost leaves to return to the South especially as his funds are running low and he hasn't sold his book yet.Sophie convinces Stingo to stay; and we see even more of the tumultuous relationship between Sophie and Nathan--as well as a new explanation of her past to Stingo. As the plot unfolds, Stingo, Sophie and Nathan become all the more close--and Stingo has an encounter with Nathan's brother Larry (Stephen D. Newman) that is also quite shocking.Actually, I haven't given away as much of the plot as it may seem; you will understand that when you see this film. I won't give away more of the plot either; but suffice it to say that the devastating, demoralizing choice that Sophie had to make will haunt you for quite some while to come; it's one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched in any movie.Other actors performed very well in this film; Greta Turken did a great job as Leslie Lapidus and G&uuml;nther Maria Halmer brilliantly portrays Rudolf Hoess, the actual Nazi Commandant at Auschwitz and the only person in this film who actually existed. Marvin Hamlisch's original music for the film adds even more to the quality of the picture.The DVD comes with an interesting documentary (""Death Dreams at Mourning"") that includes actors Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Peter MacNicol as well as Marvin Hamlisch; and we get the theatrical trailer. There are production notes and brief comments on still screens about the principle actors in the film.Sophie's Choice easily stands the test of time; the film is every bit as powerful now as it was when it was first released because of the nature of the story as it relates to the horrors of World War Two.

Sophie is a Polish immigrant.The movie portrays the meeting and unfolding relation between the inexperienced Stingo and this relatively experienced couple (Nathan and Sophie), a man and woman who are both having severe difficulty to cope with living their lives.Though the character of Sophie, and her story, is what is probably most appealing in this movie, I think this movie can still be considered 'a coming of age movie', because Stingo's perspective remains central.This is definitely a great movie and one of my favourites.

76300,ACIJVXJWC1SJO,0784011710,R. Geatz,"[2, 5]","There is so much that is right about this film that it seems a shame to point out its flaws, but.... What's right is Meryl Streep. Besides the stunning technical achievements: mastering 2 foreign languages and accents, and a look that ranges from bountiful and beautiful to emaciated and ravaged; Streep creates a multi-dimentional character whom you believe and care about, yet whose mystery makes you need to watch, probe, speculate and question. It's an achievement up there with DeNiro's performance in ""Raging Bull"" where the actor fully becomes someone else. (I'm always surprised by those who find Streep mannered and unconvincing.) The other thing that's right about the film is the music and cinematography, capturing both a romantic nostalgia for post-war Brooklyn and the dimmed-color, horrific memory of Auschwitz. Much of what I find wrong with the film is also wrong with the book. Nathan turning out to be a druggie nut-case seems contrived--especially in how it is snidely revealed by his brother in the movie. When Stingo is inducted into the ""pantheon of great writers"" at the Brooklyn Bridge, I couldn't separate the scene from my knowledge that Styron is writing this about HIMSELF! And, when Sophie's memory takes us back to Auschwitz to finally reveal her ""choice,"" it's real hard not to have a ""no, not there again"" reaction--however much the movie has carried you along.

The character is layered and rich with emotional baggage, and Meryl's  performances is nothing short of transcendental.  When I saw this movie in  the theatre upon its release, there was an older woman in the audience,  towards the front, who ran screaming from the theatre, her hands on her  ears, during the gut-twisting &quot;choice&quot; sequence.  Kevin Kline and  Peter MacNicol, who do battle over Sophie, and within their own hearts, are  exceptional foils for Sophie, and each brings a resonance to the evocative  Brooklyn locations.  The European sequences, swathed in a sepia tone, are  mesmerizing and horrific.  Sophie's journey is also a mystery, and it  unravels with devastating results.  Marvin Hamlish designed the lush  musical score, which continues to rip my heart open every time I play it.  While Schindler's List is a more gigantic vision of the experience of the  Holocaust, this movie is intensely personal, but does perhaps more to drive  a stake through your heart.

'Sophie's Choice' should be compulsory viewing for any member of the voting panel who decides Academy Award winners. Quite simply, Meryl Streep's performance is THE benchmark for that 'Best Actress' category. I've seen a lot of films and not one performance has ever (or perhaps will ever) equal her's. The manner in which she embodies Sophie is beyond scrutiny, it is too accomplished and moving for words.Sophie is a person who is naive, jaded, innocent, guilt stricken, soft and gentle, hard as nails, loving and giving, and both practical and poetic to a fault. She is a classic tragic figure, a lesson in how to deal with the horrors of life and how not to deal with how those horrors haunt you. She is funny, soft and sweet, and you want to put your arms around her. Then you realize that underneath that childlike woman is a woman who has given up on childhood. She is a study in contradictions, speaking English, German, and Polish to survive at all costs. Then along comes Nathan, expertly portrayed by Kevin Kline (possibly one of his most challenging and multi-layered roles), and her life takes another turn.But we see all this through the wondering, innocent eyes of Stingo (Peter MacNicol), and the terror, love, laughs, friendship and alienation he experiences, that we experience.Aside from Streep's breathtaking pivotal performance, there are so many other reasons to own, collect and cherish this film -- Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol in their once in a lifetime role (I bet you cannot imagine anybody other than MacNicol who could portray Stingo like he does!), the beautiful cinematography, the haunting score which I realized was never overly touching or pretentiously dramatic....and yes, the key scene -- The Choice of Choices -- is possibly the most poignant scene ever on film, and how Meryl interprets Sophie during this scene is, by itself, worth an award! I loved this movie.All I can say to sum up is: required viewing!

The film of course is much more than this, but is essentially the foundation. Kevin Kline plays her lover, and his role is also interesting as the schizophrenic. It's hard to believe the film is over 20 years old. Many have argued that the film is slow paced, and that it takes awhile for the flashbacks. I think this is important though for character development. Sophie's Choice is a tragic overwhelming story that deserves a place in your film collection.DVD SUMMARY: If you read the ""Widescreen Review"" report, you would probably want to steer cleer of this DVD - because they've given the film transfer a less than impressive rating. Apparently this DVD is not 16:9 enhanced (AKA anamorphic).Well, I obviously can't tell the difference between a film that is 16:9 enhanced and one that isn't, because Sophie's Choice is a better transfer than I expected. In fact, it's just as clear as DVD's that I own that apparently are 16:9 enhanced. In a nutshell, I was pleasantly surprised with the transfer of ""Sophie's Choice"" in light of ""Widescreen Review's"" analysis.The audio is disappointing, so I agree with them on that. However, if you have a 5.1 amplifier, you can utilise all the speakers in a pretend type surround, and this helps to a great degree. It beats listening to it just on the front speakers. The extras are great. There is a documentary, but not in the truesense because it is more based on the the film, although it does, at times, speak with Holocaust survivors. This doco is about 1 hour in length, and is a true bonus. Production notes, actor's notes, and a trailer complete the package.Regardless of what ""Widescreen Review"" report, this DVD is still worth buying. Trust me, the picture quality is great.
