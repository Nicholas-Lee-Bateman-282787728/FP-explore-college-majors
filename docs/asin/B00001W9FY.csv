512107,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,B00001W9FY,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[1, 1]","This was a movie that touched on many subjects. There was love and jealousy, a man's refusal to let a woman go when it was clear she did not love him; there was the ageing football player who was having problems coming to terms with his mortality not to mention his poor financial status; there was corporate greed as well as the malfesance of crooked corporate lawyers who duped their clients. This movie had it all.Jeff Bridges (In Perhaps His Finest Role To that Point) is remarkable as Terry Brogan, an ageing football player for the now defunct LA Outlaws. Brogan is cut because of injury and as a result has to turn to a crooked businessman named Jake. Jake hires Terry to find his girlfriend who has fled to Mexico after seriously injuring him. Brogan heads to Mexico and finds Jessie but falls in love with her. The two stay in Mexican paradise but this time Hank Sully, former coach of Outlaws is sent to retrieve the girl. A fight ensues and Sully is slain. Jessie returns to America in terror, while Brogan follows on her heels.James Woods' character (Jake) was a man who refused to let go of a woman. He was so blinded by love that he could not see how his obsession with Jessie was internecine to him. This refusal to let go of a woman who does not love him in the end leads to his destruction. However, this is difficult for all men to realize. The love of a woman destroys men from all walks of life.I won't give away the rising action and climax of this film, which I might add were original for the time period. This was a refreshing film, and I all the more like it because it was crisply edited. I was able to view the scenes of the movie that were cut on DVD. The director and editor did a remarkable job. Leonard Maltin gave this film Two and Half stars. That is too harsh in my opinion. I give this movie Four Stars for the acting and the production. The casting was remarkeable too. Saul Rubinek, in one of his first roles was phenomenal! So were some of the others in the film, like Alex Karras. There can be no doubt that Bridges showed his true mettle in this movie. Too, he and Rachel Ward had incredible chemistry together. The film encapsulates the 1980s very, very well. While it is no Body Double or Scarface, it will definately keep you entertained. Buy this movie and you won't be disappointed.I liked the subplot of how football players are exploited like slaves by the powerful elite owners. Their playing time is limited, and as a result they are always replaceable. That is what happened to Brogan. Coming back too soon to help the team causes him to reaggrivate his injury which only gets him cut in the end by heartless owners. When he turns to the man who represented him (Who He Helped Make Much Money) he is given the cold shoulder. It is a cold world out there, and Against All Odds shows this from a football player's perspective. I identified with Brogan and felt for him, even though he should have been better at saving his money and investing his finances (By His Own Admission In The Film). Despite his character flaws (Which Included Point Shaving), Brogan was for the most part a decent guy. I was pleased to see how things ended up for him at the end of the movie.A.

The VERY best of the old and the new.  This movie was a classy remake of ""Out of the Past"" which was made sometime in the 1950's.Rachel Ward plays a spoiled rich girl bent on rebellion much to the consternation of her mother played by Jane Greer.  ""Jessie"" (Rachel Ward) runs away from home and aging football star, Terry Brogan, (Jeff Bridges) is hired to find her by her boyfriend Jake Wise. (James Woods)  From there this plot takes off with more twists and turns than I have ever seen in a movie.  The triad of Jake, Terry, and Jessie becomes more entangled and complicated in a maze of deadly secrets and lies.What I loved about this film was the way the director used the plots and subplots to weave together a fantastic and suspenseful drama.  Richard Widmark is superb as the corrupt Ben Caxton.  The soundtrack is exceptional and the scenery is great.

512110,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B00001W9FY,Austin Somlo,"[0, 4]","Viewed: 5/08Rate: 35/08: Against All Odds is an, despite against all odds, extraordinarily boring picture. The story was mediocre, the acting was okay, and the direction was below average. Dang it, Taylor Hackford sucks when it comes to directing except for An Officer and a Gentleman, which was probably luck. Mixing football and film noir does not pass for entertainment. Jeff Bridges looked great when it came to his beard and body. Rachel Ward had something going great with her co-star, but it fizzled away after ten minutes or so. Then I was stuck with tediousness. James Woods, again and again no matter how hard he tries, is so ordinary in his character. There was nothing special about him, and he doesn't come across as a villain; it was just basically James Woods with a bit of hair problem. Prior to seeing Against All Odds, I thought I would see a rip-off scene from From Here to Eternity, but it didn't show. Was I misinformed or what? The ending of Against All Odds was bad in a weird way, and I didn't particularly like how the events unfolded. It was just linear and one-dimensional. The characters weren't at least interesting. Honestly, I wished Jeff Bridges to have made the movie better than its worth given everything involved, but he was lackluster. There is absolutely nothing wrong with his performance, but his potential was untapped. I read that Against All Odds is described as film noir, but in my opinion, it didn't pass for one in most of the scenes. The romance thing was working out between Rachel Ward and Jeff Bridges until Sully finds them in some Mayan temple room. A good question emerges: how exactly did he know they would be inside there? Why would Brogan show a photo of a woman to bunch of nobodies when he could have flashed it to high-class looking people? Heck, finding the girl in Mexico didn't turn out to be so hard. Overall, Against All Odds disappoints and then strives harder for mediocrity and achieves with ease. Skip this dud and go straight for Body Heat.",2,Weak Jeff Bridges Performance.

512112,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,B00001W9FY,Brooser Bear,"[1, 1]","Before 'eighties became a cliche, it was considered modern and chick. This is a serious film from that era. It takes its time for the story to develop and for the dialogue to sink in. James Woods gives an excellent performance as a nightclub owner and a gangster. Rachel Ward does an excellent job portraying an adventurous woman in an age before adventurous women in pop culture came to be signified with guns and leather jackets. The film is really two films in one; the first is a romantic triangle between James Woods, Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward. The connection between athletics and organized crime and nightclubs hangs ominously in the background and the characters are subtle, if not sophisticated, showing off the eighties hip in the natural setting, and it culminates in Jeff Bridges discovering the girl.The second part of the film is poorly done, essentially it's a remake of Chinatown with a giant conspiracy that unites the real estate developers wit organized criminals and the football team in one universal conspiracy. Guns are fired, people wind up dead and everything is tied up neatly in the end. It's too conveniet to be a decent thriller and it avoids the complications of dealing with girl leaving the leading man on her own free will and going back to the creep she used to be with, which come to think of it, is the realistic ending!They could have made an excellent film by developing the romantic story to its conclusion and treating it relaistically, as they had the first part of the film, leaving the guy holding the empty bag in the end, alone and picking over the remains of his career, instead they opted for a typically Hollywood conclusion of ending up with the Big Bang fireworks of biblical proportion that lets the leading man get away clean and start over again.",3,BLAST FROM THE PAST,1009497600,"12 28, 2001",2001,1802,"[""'eighties"", 'became', 'cliche', 'was', 'considered', 'modern', 'chick', 'serious', 'film', 'era', 'time', 'story', 'develop', 'dialogue', 'sink', 'James', 'Woods', 'excellent', 'performance', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'gangster', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'adventurous', 'woman', 'age', 'before', 'adventurous', 'women', 'pop', 'culture', 'came', 'be', 'signified', 'guns', 'leather', 'jackets', 'film', 'really', 'two', 'films', 'one', 'first', 'romantic', 'triangle', 'James', 'Woods', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'connection', 'athletics', 'organized', 'crime', 'nightclubs', 'hangs', 'ominously', 'background', 'characters', 'are', 'subtle', 'not', 'sophisticated', 'showing', 'off', 'eighties', 'hip', 'natural', 'setting', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'discovering', 'girl.The', 'second', 'part', 'film', 'poorly', 'done', 'essentially', 'remake', 'Chinatown', 'giant', 'conspiracy', 'real', 'estate', 'developers', 'wit', 'organized', 'criminals', 'football', 'team', 'one', 'universal', 'conspiracy', 'Guns', 'are', 'fired', 'people', 'wind', 'up', 'dead', 'everything', 'tied', 'up', 'neatly', 'end', 'too', 'conveniet', 'be', 'decent', 'thriller', 'complications', 'dealing', 'girl', 'leaving', 'leading', 'man', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'going', 'back', 'creep', 'used', 'be', 'come', 'think', 'realistic', 'ending', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'excellent', 'film', 'developing', 'romantic', 'story', 'conclusion', 'treating', 'relaistically', 'had', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'leaving', 'guy', 'holding', 'empty', 'bag', 'end', 'alone', 'picking', 'remains', 'career', 'instead', 'opted', 'typically', 'Hollywood', 'conclusion', 'ending', 'up', 'Big', 'Bang', 'fireworks', 'biblical', 'proportion', 'leading', 'man', 'get', 'away', 'clean', 'start', 'again']",Against All Odds

What a waste of good actors and beautiful locations. It is truly poignant to see the highlights of the Yucatan area circa 1983 before that wondrous part of the world became package tour Gringolandia and that alone is almost worth the two hours and two bucks but Good God does this movie nosedive into atrocious absurdity over the last hour or so! I think a couple of more rewrites might have done a world of good as none of the actors involved are bad (George Poppadopalous arguably notwithstanding), the locations are second to none, and the basic storyline had at least a marginal amount of promise.

Because when he's not on screen displaying his phenomenal sexuality, the picture goes flat. This movie also proves that you don't have to be X-rated to raise the temperatures of your viewers. And after we've seen it, we realize that there was nothing graphic shown--except for just a split second of love-making, deep in shadows and filmed in long shot where you only see sihoulettes.No other movie male star has looked so amazingly hot and beautiful on screen as this stunning young Adonis who was captured at the very peak of his beauty.  His blue yes, his stunning torso, sun streaked locks and physical movements are all lovingly preserved forever on the screen by director Taylor Hackford. The director does something quite interesting here: insttead of having the rather anemic femme star, Rachel Ward (does anybody remember her?)as the sex interest, he turns Bridges into the red-hot lust object. And no wonder. In scene after scene, Ward is desperate to rip Jeff's shirt off, and later all of his clothes. In one extraordinary scene, they've just made love. Both are nearly naked. Ward rests her head on Jeff's chest and caresses it hungrily as he tells her about his failure as a football star. The camera moves into a close-up of Jeff's face and if possible, he conveys both sadness and carnal desire at the same time. Their passion is so sweaty and hot I would love to have been a fly on the wall to see what really happened between takes.When he's not on the screen, the movie suffers. Curiously, the credits showcase Rachel Ward as the top star, with Bridges second. When the movie came out, it was Jeff who astounded the critics and his fans with his performance.

L LaRegina ""Jim LaRegina""","[1, 1]","If it is possible to rate art the way CONSUMER REPORTS magazine rates appliances, I award the 1984 film AGAINST ALL ODDS four stars but add a fifth for this D.V.D. because of two of its features, commentaries by 1)the director and two actors and 2) the director and writer.The drama-thriller AGAINST ALL ODDS tells the story of people struggling to keep what they don't realize or we don't realize was never theirs, with the ruins of Cozumel, Mexico, a foreshadowing setting.  James Woods' performance as the intense bookie Jake Wise knocked me out when I saw AGAINST ALL ODDS at the movies in 1984.  While the original poster pictures lead actors Rachel Ward and Jeff Bridges, I notice the D.V.D. image here includes Woods, whose career continued to blossom probably in part due to his work in this picture.All these years later, a couple of weak plot devices in AGAINST ALL ODDS work against what is otherwise still a challenging story for grown-ups.  Most distracting is a fight between lead character Terry Brogan, a football player played by Bridges, and one of his coaches, an ex-player played by Alex Karras, where Brogan emerges as if nothing happened despite, among other blows, having the Karras character kick him in the stomach.  Also, the character of Edie, played by Swoosie Kurtz, proves instrumental to resolving the story but she is left out of the film's wrap-up.I guess because of the hit 1983 television drama THE THORN BIRDS, Rachel Ward has top billing in AGAINST ALL ODDS. At the time one might have thought Ward was on her way to stardom, as she also had the films SHARKY'S MACHINE and DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID under her belt but I never saw her in another movie or television production after AGAINST ALL ODDS.Interesting and, thanks to James Woods, often funny, the two AGAINST ALL ODDS commentaries add value to this D.V.D. package.

Well, it sure is not that type of a movie.  The lines between good guy and bad guy are really blurry here, and the love in this one comes with a ""double edge sword"".This movie borders on-the-line between movies like ""9 1/2 Weeks"" (1986)- ""Cocktail"" (1988) - ""Tequila Sunrise"" (1988) -  ""Revenge"" (1990) - and ""Breathless"" (1983).  I would dare to classify this one as a romantic thriller/ with a very neo-noir plot-line.  The acting is really good, the twists and turns make the movie even more interesting, and the chemistry between Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward is purely amazing...they seem genuinely in love with each other...the scenes that involve their love making are HOT HOT HOT!!!

512139,A167819XDO1498,B00001W9FY,Mandie,"[0, 0]","I read the reviews like everyone else before buying this movie, and I have to disagree with some of them. Although this movie does make you wonder where all of it went wrong in the first place, I had fun watching it. It was an interesting maze, filled with dark secrets. Anyone who likes finding the dirt on other people (in movies, if not in reality) would find this movie very appealing. It's like every character in this movie has some kind of dirt on them (Don't we all?).With every twist, my mouth dropped and I was like ""Oh no, he/she didn't!"" It's true that you can kind of see where the twist is coming and how it will come up but by the time you can get over it, the plot has continued without you, but eventually one catches up.To be fairly honest, I only watched this because of James Woods, being a girl fanatic about him. On his part, he had some amazing acting, and this goes right along with his trademark of portraying dark, intense characters. Though he wasn't as intense as I would have expected him to be, he still gave that stunning performace, creating a certain creepiness out of Jake, that makes the audience know he's not playing games with anyone.My only complaint that keeps this movie from being five stars is that I felt there were too many love scenes between Jeff Bridge's character and his co-actress. Though the two made some great chemistry, I thought there were one too many love scenes.The scenery is very breath-taking, making shots of the Mayan Ruins where not a lot of movies have been able to take place. I am a bit of a history buff so when the two stars talk about how Mayans used to place bets on football, you get a little taste of a Roman game, in some ways. It's stunning and breath-taking, almost makes me want to go there and see it for myself.This movie was very good, despite some bad reviews. I'd say if there's a fan out there that likes Jeff Bridges or James Woods, they must watch this movie. Even if they don't watch it again, at least you can have it under the belt as one of the movies they've watched.I'm keeping this movie :)",4,Great Ride,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,2083,"['read', 'reviews', 'everyone', 'else', 'buying', 'movie', 'have', 'disagree', 'movie', 'make', 'wonder', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'first', 'place', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'was', 'interesting', 'maze', 'filled', 'dark', 'secrets', 'Anyone', 'who', 'finding', 'dirt', 'other', 'people', 'movies', 'not', 'reality', 'would', 'find', 'movie', 'very', 'appealing', 'character', 'movie', 'kind', 'dirt', 'Do', ""n't"", '.With', 'twist', 'mouth', 'dropped', 'was', 'Oh', 'he/she', 'did', ""n't"", 'true', 'can', 'kind', 'see', 'where', 'twist', 'coming', 'how', 'will', 'come', 'up', 'time', 'can', 'get', 'plot', 'continued', 'eventually', 'one', 'catches', 'up.To', 'be', 'fairly', 'honest', 'only', 'watched', 'James', 'Woods', 'being', 'girl', 'fanatic', 'part', 'had', 'amazing', 'acting', 'right', 'along', 'trademark', 'portraying', 'dark', 'intense', 'characters', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'intense', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'be', 'still', 'gave', 'stunning', 'performace', 'creating', 'certain', 'creepiness', 'Jake', 'audience', 'know', 'not', 'playing', 'games', 'anyone.My', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'being', 'five', 'stars', 'felt', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'love', 'scenes', 'Jeff', 'Bridge', 'character', 'co-actress', 'two', 'made', 'great', 'chemistry', 'thought', 'were', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'love', 'scenes.The', 'scenery', 'very', 'breath-taking', 'making', 'shots', 'Mayan', 'Ruins', 'where', 'not', 'lot', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'take', 'place', 'am', 'bit', 'history', 'buff', 'so', 'when', 'two', 'stars', 'talk', 'how', 'Mayans', 'used', 'place', 'bets', 'football', 'get', 'little', 'taste', 'Roman', 'game', 'ways', 'stunning', 'breath-taking', 'almost', 'want', 'go', 'there', 'see', 'myself.This', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'bad', 'reviews', ""'d"", 'say', 'fan', 'there', 'likes', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'James', 'Woods', 'must', 'watch', 'movie', 'Even', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'again', 'least', 'can', 'have', 'belt', 'one', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'watched.I', ""'m"", 'keeping', 'movie']",Against All Odds

When injuries get him cut from the team, he re-connects with a former pal who earns his living from gambling and a high end night club.  Jake (a slimy James Woods) also has Terry (Bridges) by the short hairs for shaving points in a game early in his career.  In this remake of the classic film noir ""Out of the Past,"" Jake wants Terry to track down his girlfriend who stabbed him and made off with $50K.  In a further complication, Jessie (Rachel Ward) is also the daughter of the football team's owner, Mrs. Wyler played by Jane Greer.In a wonderful bit of casting, Greer played the girl on the run in the original ""Out of the Past.""  There is a back story involving bribing public officials so that Mrs. Wyler and her newish husband (Richard Widmark) can develop prime land overlooking the city.  Terry travels to Cozumel on Jake's ""dime"" looking for Jesse.  He finds her, and after some flirtatious byplay they begin a 2 week romance on the beaches of the Caribbean.  When this film was released, much of the talk was about the hot sex scene inside a natural steam room.  By today's standards it's pretty mild stuff.Eventually the money runs out so they make plans to return to the U. S.  Jake, tired of waiting sends another one of his cronies to find the couple.  He is the thuggish conditioning coach of the football team, played by former NFL great Alex Karras.  In a brief fight, Jessie shoots Sully (Karras) and flees, leaving Terry to deal with Sully's body.  When Terry returns to L. A. he looks up Jake only to find Jessie is again playing house with him.  Jake has another assignment, but Terry begins to see a double cross coming.Directed by Taylor Hackford, Terry's fight ""against all odds"" to clear his name sometimes gets in melodrama mode and feels like a drawn out soap opera.  Fortunately the performances by Woods, Bridges and even Greer in her small role, save the film.  Ward and Bridges certainly look good together rolling around inside their shimmering suntanned skin which I think was the marketing push at the time.  Ultimately a worthwhile film but no match for the original.This viewing was on the DVD ""Special Edition"" which looks pretty good on a Blu ray player.  The audio options include 2-channel Dolby Surround and a 4.0 Dolby Digital.  My receiver says the rear channel is mono out of both speakers.  In any case it sounds fine especially when emphasizing the score by Michel Columbier and jazz guitarist Larry Carlton.

One of the first videos we rented was thsi one and though I was a little young I watched it to the end, fascinated---the complexity even then floored me and I remember crying at the end.  (My mother fell asleep halfway through.)  Pulled out another videotape while on vacation and watched this movie again and it drew me in, I haven't watched it in years so there was a level of not quite remembering what occurred and why.  What has always caught me in this movie was Rachel Ward as Jessie and how essentially flawed she is, she has enough of a cherubic face and a sensual appeal that it's never quite clear how much of her actions are genuine fear and genuine manipulation.  I had forgotten the scene where she goes to her familyf or help and her descriptiopns of her relationships to them are belied by the way her mother shows genuine concern for her and the way she she cuddles up and into her godfather's arms---the exact same way she does with Jeff Bridges and James Woods (both who inhabit the roles, the dialogue with an ease and menace that is wonderful)!  Her mom, Jane Greer stands behind them with a look on her face that suggests there is another layer of relationship going on between the two that crosses some line, it's a perfect moment to watch for.  Swoosie Kurtz shows up in a pivotal role that got me to take notice of her and remember her and her name even way back then (much like Grace Zibrikie) and there is enough meat to her to show that Terry doesn't notice a good thing right unde rhis nose as she shows him a kindness and eventually an assistance that puts her in constant career and physical jeopardy. The plot is complicated and secondary to the point of the story which is Jessie getting people to love her and then it being a measuring game of who can take better care of her.  At the end when she watches Terry and the crtedits role, as she still stands there, small motions occuring, it is a brilliant way to capture her many mercurial moods and to also heighten the thought of what will occur between these two later one, there is a playfulness to her, a lack of regret, that suggests that even with the risk they'll get back together but after watchign her in action---is that a good idea? The best, absolutely best part of this is the sweat house sex scene--I'm by no means a film voyeur but it rates as literally number one of number two on teh scale of movie erotica---there is a moment when Rachel Ward cries a single tear that to this day blows me away, lookign at acting and even the intimacy, it crosses that invisible line where I sometimes wonder if everyone is unattached in a scene in their personal lives, how real is a sex scene?",5,Long time favorite,994118400,"07 3, 2001",2001,2875,"['Back', '1985', 'must', ""'ve"", 'been', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'video', 'remember', 'mother', 'buying', 'VCR', 'Betamax', 'finallky', 'going', 'new', 'neighborhood', 'video', 'store', 'see', 'what', 'wa', 'sthere', 'One', 'first', 'videos', 'rented', 'was', 'thsi', 'one', 'was', 'little', 'young', 'watched', 'end', 'fascinated', '-the', 'complexity', 'even', 'then', 'floored', 'remember', 'crying', 'end', 'mother', 'fell', 'asleep', 'halfway', 'Pulled', 'out', 'videotape', 'vacation', 'watched', 'movie', 'again', 'drew', 'have', ""n't"", 'watched', 'years', 'so', 'there', 'was', 'level', 'not', 'quite', 'remembering', 'what', 'occurred', 'why', 'What', 'always', 'caught', 'movie', 'was', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'Jessie', 'how', 'essentially', 'flawed', 'enough', 'cherubic', 'face', 'sensual', 'appeal', 'never', 'quite', 'clear', 'how', 'much', 'actions', 'are', 'genuine', 'fear', 'genuine', 'manipulation', 'had', 'forgotten', 'scene', 'where', 'familyf', 'help', 'descriptiopns', 'relationships', 'are', 'belied', 'way', 'mother', 'genuine', 'concern', 'way', 'up', 'godfather', 'arms', '-the', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'James', 'Woods', 'who', 'inhabit', 'roles', 'dialogue', 'ease', 'menace', 'wonderful', 'mom', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'look', 'face', 'layer', 'relationship', 'going', 'two', 'line', 'perfect', 'moment', 'watch', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'up', 'pivotal', 'role', 'got', 'take', 'notice', 'remember', 'name', 'even', 'way', 'back', 'then', 'much', 'Grace', 'Zibrikie', 'enough', 'meat', 'show', 'Terry', ""n't"", 'notice', 'good', 'thing', 'right', 'unde', 'rhis', 'nose', 'kindness', 'eventually', 'assistance', 'constant', 'career', 'physical', 'jeopardy', 'plot', 'complicated', 'secondary', 'point', 'story', 'Jessie', 'getting', 'people', 'love', 'then', 'being', 'measuring', 'game', 'who', 'can', 'take', 'better', 'care', 'end', 'when', 'Terry', 'crtedits', 'role', 'still', 'there', 'small', 'motions', 'occuring', 'brilliant', 'way', 'capture', 'many', 'mercurial', 'moods', 'also', 'heighten', 'thought', 'what', 'will', 'occur', 'two', 'later', 'one', 'playfulness', 'lack', 'regret', 'even', 'risk', ""'ll"", 'get', 'back', 'together', 'watchign', 'action', '-is', 'good', 'idea', 'best', 'absolutely', 'best', 'part', 'sweat', 'house', 'sex', 'scene', ""'m"", 'film', 'voyeur', 'rates', 'literally', 'number', 'one', 'number', 'two', 'teh', 'scale', 'movie', 'erotica', 'moment', 'when', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'single', 'tear', 'day', 'away', 'lookign', 'acting', 'even', 'intimacy', 'invisible', 'line', 'where', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'everyone', 'unattached', 'scene', 'personal', 'lives', 'how', 'real', 'sex', 'scene']",Against All Odds

No one apparently had been allowed to film there before.  And  Jane Greer is great as the chilly mother of Ms. Ward and real estate heiress.  In a role that demonstrates the calm and quiet banality of evil, Ms. Greer is also a link back to the film's inspiration - the great ""Out of the Past,"" which she did with Robert Mitchum in 1947.It's true the film comes apart a little i the end with some obvious twists you'll see coming.  But it doesn't matter.  The whole effort is beautifully shot and assembled with a young Swoosie Kurtz thrown in for some comic relief.Blu-Ray update:I was ready to pick up the blu-ray of this title, which came out in Spring 2011. However, it's only a single layer BD disc. The studios should come up with a new rule that if in 2011 and beyond they're going to take a cheap approach to transfers of great films and only place them on 25GB discs instead of the normal 50GB, then they should charge half the price of a normal blu-ray.  I'll unfortunately need to pass on what would have otherwise been an automatic upgrade.",5,Beautiful scenery of Mayan ruins and a good story,946252800,"12 27, 1999",1999,1656,"['Director', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'mistakes', 'out', 'one', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'area', 'disc', 'When', 'saw', 'back', '1984', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'heck', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'was', 'doing', 'flying', 'around', 'Mexico', 'throw', 'James', 'Woods', 'train', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'went', 'Mayan', 'ruins', 'Chichen', 'Itza', 'awesome', 'hellishly', 'hot', 'spot', 'visited', '1995', 'deleted', 'scene', 'make', 'clear', 'really', 'enhanced', 'enjoyment', 'film.Whether', 'movie', 'not', 'chance', 'see', 'seaside', 'ruins', 'Tulum', 'astronomical', 'temple', 'Chichen', 'Itza', 'one', 'apparently', 'had', 'been', 'allowed', 'film', 'there', 'before', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'great', 'chilly', 'mother', 'Ms.', 'Ward', 'real', 'estate', 'heiress', 'role', 'calm', 'quiet', 'banality', 'evil', 'Ms.', 'Greer', 'also', 'link', 'back', 'film', 'inspiration', 'great', 'Out', 'Past', 'did', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', '1947.It', 'true', 'film', 'apart', 'little', 'i', 'end', 'obvious', 'twists', ""'ll"", 'see', 'coming', ""n't"", 'matter', 'whole', 'effort', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'assembled', 'young', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'thrown', 'comic', 'relief.Blu-Ray', 'update', 'was', 'ready', 'pick', 'up', 'blu-ray', 'title', 'came', 'out', 'Spring', '2011', 'However', 'only', 'single', 'layer', 'BD', 'disc', 'studios', 'should', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'rule', '2011', ""'re"", 'going', 'take', 'cheap', 'approach', 'transfers', 'great', 'films', 'only', 'place', '25GB', 'discs', 'instead', 'normal', '50GB', 'then', 'should', 'charge', 'price', 'normal', 'blu-ray', ""'ll"", 'unfortunately', 'need', 'pass', 'would', 'have', 'otherwise', 'been', 'automatic', 'upgrade']",Against All Odds

Be that as it may, ""Against All Odds"" is an LA noir film: it profits from the unique atmosphere of Los Angeles, the sinister corruption behind the sunny smile; the reality of arid desert behind the wastefully-watered green lawn.  And most particularly, the parched, penned-up ill-respected Los Angeles River that features in Roman Polansky's mythic ""Chinatown, and ""in ""The Narrows,"" one of Michael Connelly's recent books. The river also, of course, features in that well-known teenage film noir,""Grease,"" in which John Travolta and his all-singing, all-dancing fool friends stage their drag race in the river's concreted bed, graced by only the merest trickle of water. The Los Angeles River: Ignored until it rampages.""Against All Odds"" is a loose 1980's remake of Robert Mitchum's film noir, ""Out of the Past.""  Jane Greer. femme fatale of the earlier film, plays mother to Rachel Ward, this film's femme fatale.  Richard Widmark, important player in many earlier films noir, is on hand here too, in a small but critically important part.  The plot is set in motion when Jake Wise,(James Woods), well-connected nightclub owner and man of many parts, sets his old friend, used-up former pro football player Terry Brogan (Jeff Bridges), to find and return his runaway girlfriend Jessie Wyler (Rachel Ward), hiding somewhere in Mexico.For starters, Mexico, Bridges and Ward have never looked hotter, the Ward-Bridges sex scenes are too darn hot, and the seemingly mandatory confusing LA real estate corruption subplot doesn't stop the main story line cold too often. The film was ably directed by Taylor Hackford, and the three principals carry their roles. There's also a flavorful supporting cast: Swoosie Kurtz, Saul Rubinek, Alex Karras, Dorian Harewood. ""Against All Odds"" is a bit dated, stuck in the '80's, and it's not the greatest noir story ever told, but it offers a lot of visual heat.  It also delivers on the emotional heat meter, at least to me: true to noir conventions, nobody gets what they want, surely not Terry Brogan, who realizes, belatedly, that Jessie Wyler is literally too hot for him to handle,and he's going to have to leave her to her rich, powerful mother.  Yes, it's been done before, possibly better, but ""Against All Odds"" stands and delivers on its own, and is worth a look-see.",5,Too Hot to Handle,1162857600,"11 7, 2006",2006,2505,"['Expert', 'opinion', 'advent', 'color', 'film', 'good', 'contemporary', 'noir', 'film', 'L.A.', 'noir', 'film', 'be', 'largely', 'so', 'then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Body', 'Heat', 'set', 'Florida', 'Be', 'may', 'Odds', 'LA', 'noir', 'film', 'profits', 'unique', 'atmosphere', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'sinister', 'corruption', 'sunny', 'smile', 'reality', 'arid', 'desert', 'wastefully-watered', 'green', 'lawn', 'most', 'particularly', 'parched', 'penned-up', 'ill-respected', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'River', 'Roman', 'Polansky', 'mythic', 'Chinatown', 'Narrows', 'one', 'Michael', 'Connelly', 'recent', 'books', 'river', 'also', 'course', 'features', 'well-known', 'teenage', 'film', 'noir', 'Grease', 'John', 'Travolta', 'all-singing', 'all-dancing', 'fool', 'friends', 'stage', 'drag', 'race', 'river', 'concreted', 'bed', 'graced', 'only', 'merest', 'trickle', 'water', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'River', 'Ignored', 'Odds', 'loose', '1980', 'remake', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'film', 'noir', 'Past', 'Jane', 'Greer', 'femme', 'fatale', 'earlier', 'film', 'mother', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'film', 'femme', 'fatale', 'Richard', 'Widmark', 'important', 'player', 'many', 'earlier', 'films', 'noir', 'hand', 'here', 'too', 'small', 'critically', 'important', 'part', 'plot', 'set', 'motion', 'when', 'Jake', 'Wise', 'James', 'Woods', 'well-connected', 'nightclub', 'owner', 'man', 'many', 'parts', 'old', 'friend', 'used-up', 'former', 'pro', 'football', 'player', 'Terry', 'Brogan', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'find', 'return', 'runaway', 'girlfriend', 'Jessie', 'Wyler', 'Rachel', 'Ward', 'hiding', 'somewhere', 'Mexico.For', 'starters', 'Mexico', 'Bridges', 'Ward', 'have', 'never', 'looked', 'hotter', 'Ward-Bridges', 'sex', 'scenes', 'are', 'too', 'darn', 'hot', 'seemingly', 'mandatory', 'confusing', 'LA', 'real', 'estate', 'corruption', 'subplot', ""n't"", 'stop', 'main', 'story', 'line', 'cold', 'too', 'often', 'film', 'was', 'ably', 'directed', 'Taylor', 'Hackford', 'three', 'principals', 'carry', 'roles', 'also', 'flavorful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Swoosie', 'Kurtz', 'Saul', 'Rubinek', 'Alex', 'Karras', 'Dorian', 'Harewood', 'Odds', 'bit', 'dated', 'stuck', ""'80"", 'not', 'greatest', 'noir', 'story', 'ever', 'told', 'lot', 'visual', 'heat', 'also', 'emotional', 'heat', 'meter', 'least', 'true', 'noir', 'conventions', 'nobody', 'what', 'want', 'surely', 'not', 'Terry', 'Brogan', 'who', 'belatedly', 'Jessie', 'Wyler', 'literally', 'too', 'hot', 'handle', 'going', 'have', 'leave', 'rich', 'powerful', 'mother', 'Yes', 'been', 'done', 'before', 'possibly', 'better', 'Against', 'All', 'Odds', 'stands', 'delivers', 'own', 'look-see']",Against All Odds
